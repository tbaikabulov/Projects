Preamble :
Removal Men

&nbsp;

Rebecca Hales was tired. It had been a long
flight. She dragged her trolley bag through the front door of the flat she
shared with her boyfriend. �Larry?� she called, not really expecting him to be
there. No reply. Then she saw the note on the hall table. �Hi Hun, welcome
back,� it said. �I�m up in town tonight. Call me tomorrow when you get back,
we�ll do lunch if you�re not too tired.� She looked at her watch. Half past nine. Time enough to have a really good soak in the
bath and then decide. She took off her uniform forage cap and tossed it
down onto the table. She�d flown for four airlines over the last eight years
and uniforms for cabin staff had got no less stupid. Always
these terrible heavy jackets, shapeless skirts and always the stupid hats.
She shook her hair loose and kicked off her shoes. �Yes,� she thought, �a bath
before anything else.� 

&nbsp;

Her intentions were interrupted by a ring
at the door. Almost without thinking she reached out and opened it. Outside stood two men in dark blue overalls. The taller one
of the two, smiled and pulled his cap from a mass of
black curly hair. �Ms Hales?� he said, �Ms Rebecca Hales?�

&nbsp;

Rebecca nodded, puzzled.

&nbsp;

�Blue Box :
Archive Storage and Removals.� He said, gesturing to a pile of bright blue,
flat-packed, plastic crates stacked on the wheeled trolley being pushed by his
colleague.

&nbsp;

�I don�t think so,� Rebecca said. �I�m not
planning on moving and I don�t have anything that needs to go to storage.���� 

&nbsp;

The curly haired guy looked puzzled too. He
scratched the back of his head. �I�m sorry there must have been some sort of
mistake. Do you mind if I just call the depot to check,� he said taking out his
mobile phone. He was holding it in front of him, pointing directly at her. She
thought nothing of it at first. Then she said �Why are you wearing latex
gloves?�

&nbsp;

He tapped out a sequence of numbers on the
keypad. There was a quiet hiss. Rebecca looked down in surprise as the dart hit
her. She gave out a short �Oh!� at the sudden pricking sensation. A tiny
scarlet stain spread out around where the dart had pinned her white blouse to
her belly. The chemical took effect quickly, her knees buckled under her own
weight and she toppled forward into the hands of the curly haired man. He
lowered her gently to the floor.

&nbsp;

She was conscious, aware, but unable to
move. He took her under the arms and pulled her back into the apartment. His
colleague leant down and plucked the dart from her. This time she didn�t feel a thing. �Very neat,� he said, turning it over
in his hand. �Very neat indeed.�

&nbsp;

The curly headed man was rummaging through
Rebecca�s handbag. �Be careful you don�t scratch yourself with that,� he said.
�I don�t want to have to carry you out.� He pulled out a small, laminated
photo-id on a silver chain. �Rebecca Hales, Atlantic Airlines, Cabin Crew,� it
said. He held the photo against her face. �That�s her all right. Best to be sure.�

&nbsp;

�OK,� said the other, as he started turning
the flat-packs into the crates they were intended to be. �I�d have settled for
this though.� He pointed to the badge on her jacket lapel that said �Rebecca
Hales, Purser� with small replicas of the French and German flags as indicators
of the languages she spoke. �Time to wrap and pack, I guess.�� He pulled Rebecca up into a sitting position,
supporting her against his body.� She
could only watch as he reached around her and first wrapped duct tape around
her ankles fixing them together and then did the same for her wrists. 

&nbsp;

The curly headed man emerged from the
bedroom carrying a pile of her clothes. He put them into one of the crates and
tossed something to the other man. �She shouldn�t need much of a muffler, but
you might as well gag her properly.� Rebecca felt the man prise open her
unresisting mouth and push a wad of cloth between her lips. 

&nbsp;

He pulled tape across her lips sealing the
cloth in her mouth, half choking her. �You just love gagging them with their
own panties don�t you?� he said and laughed. Rebecca still had no control over
her muscles. The man wound more tape around her fingers this time and then bent
her over, first taping her wrists to her ankles and then running tape behind
her knees and around the back of her neck pulling her head forward onto her
knees. She knew that even if her muscles would do as she willed she could do
nothing to escape the embrace of the tape.

&nbsp;

As the tape was pulled around her limbs she
was aware that the other man was gathering up more of her belongings and
dumping them in crates. �Pack up your dirty looks, your songs that have no
hooks�� He�s singing, she thought... �your stacks of Modern Screen, your
portrait of the queen,� � What the hell is going on � �Da
dada dad da-da, Da dada dad
da-da,� The tape was jerked tighter as a length went around
her calves and back bundling her up into a ball. �You're headed that a-way.
You're moving out today.�

&nbsp;

Her assailant called out. �She�s ready.
Have you got everything?�

&nbsp;

�Yeah. Let�s put her in
her box.� He gripped her at the ankles, the other man lifted her from behind
and she was lowered into the crate that sat on the trolley. The curly haired
man tossed in her shoes, her hat and her handbag before fitting the lid of the
crate. Rebecca heard the clack of the other crates being stacked on top of her
own. The trolley began to move. As it bounced out of the door and up the ramp
into the truck her captor was still singing� �So pack your toys away, your
pretty boys away, your forty-fives away, your alibis away, your silly lies
away, your old tie-dyes away, your one more tries away. You're moving out
today.�

&nbsp;

Chapter 1: Lunch

&nbsp;

I was sitting in my office at Saleware.
The sign on the door said �Marketing Director�. I was feeling surprisingly fit
after the previous evening. That�s the worst of customer hospitality events, I
think. You always end up drinking more than you should � just in the interests
of keeping the customers happy. And of course as the host you�ve got to hang on
until the bitter end. I could only have had about three hours sleep. 

&nbsp;

Still, one good thing - I was amazed that I didn�t
have the least sign of a hang over. 

&nbsp;

Everything seemed really great. In fact I felt
really sharp and�

&nbsp;

It was then that my brain ran into a brick wall as
the alcohol finally caught up with me. 

&nbsp;

Five minutes later I was sitting at my desk with my
head in my hands and a glass of seltzer fizzing noisily in front of me,
courtesy of my secretary. I wasn�t in the best of moods when she put her head
around the door five minutes later and pointed at the phone. �Can you pick this
up,� she said, with a grin �I didn�t think you want me to ring through - all
things considered.�

&nbsp;

I nodded, grateful for the consideration, and
picked up the receiver. It sounded like a thousand angry snakes were hissing
down the wires. I winced and moved the receiver away from my ear as the voice
at the other end boomed out. �Morning,� it said. �Clegg here.
We spoke last night. Thought you did a good job on the event. Wondered if you might be interested in a proposition.�

&nbsp;

The good thing about Clegg�s staccato delivery was
at least I didn�t have to cope with following long sentences. He didn�t wait
for an answer.

&nbsp;

�Good, good. Thought you�d like some lunch. I�ll be
at my club, The Crescent. Come over about 1
 o�clock. See you then.�

&nbsp;

The clunk of the receiver heralded blissful
silence.

&nbsp;

I�d only met Clegg for the first time the previous
evening. His company had installed our software earlier on in the year. I ran
the marketing for SaleWare � it�s the UK end of
a US
software company specialising in systems for distribution businesses,
merchants, wholesalers, that sort of thing. Anyway we like to do profiles of
our customers when the systems have been in and running for a while. Clegg�s
company hadn�t been keen so I�d invited him along to a party we were having to launch the new version. I hadn�t really expected
him to come but he�d been there large as life and, if the squeals of some of
the girls we had on hand to ease the evening along were anything to go by,
twice as willing.

&nbsp;

He managed to avoid any discussion of a profile and
then I got drawn into a debate on the merits of some particularly abstruse new
feature with one of our more tiresome clients. I took a vodka
or two to numb the conversation. I guess that started the down-hill road to my
current condition.

&nbsp;

I climbed out of the taxi as it stopped in the
middle of a Georgian terrace of houses ranged in an elegant curve. A very small
sign on a brass plate on some railings said �The Crescent�. Some steps led down
to a basement entrance. 

&nbsp;

The woman standing at the desk just inside the
doorway peered over her spectacles as I arrived. �I don�t believe you�re a
member,� she said, suspiciously. I really wasn�t in the mood for complicated
power games, though looking at her in her well fitting, sharply tailored suit
and crisp blouse I might have been encouraged to other activities when in my
normal state of health. 

&nbsp;

�Mr Clegg,� I replied. �I�m a guest of Mr Frederick
Clegg.� 

&nbsp;

The woman�s look changed instantly to one of
ingratiating pleasantness. �Of course,� she said. �Do come this way. I�ll show
you through myself.� She ushered me across the dining room. It was a rather
more modern setting than I�d have expected for Clegg � I�d have thought deep
padded seats and tapestries on the wall were more his style; this was all bare
wood and steel. We arrived at the door to a private room and she knocked. I
heard Clegg�s voice boom out, �Come!� 

&nbsp;

The woman opened the door and showed me in. �Your
guest, Mr Clegg,� she said quietly.

&nbsp;

�Excellent,� Clegg smiled getting up and extending
his had to me. �Thank you, Hermione, give us a few minutes and then we�ll
order.�

&nbsp;

�Of course,� she said, smiling as she left the
room.

&nbsp;

Clegg watched the door close. �Snooty bitch,� he
said. Hope she didn�t give you too hard a time.�

&nbsp;

�Well, no,� I started but Clegg cut in.

&nbsp;

�Good, good. Now let me get to the point. You�ve
done a good job for SaleWare. I�d like you to come
and do the same for me.�

&nbsp;

�That�s certainly coming to the point Mr Clegg,� I
replied, startled by his bluntness.

&nbsp;

�That�s me,� said Clegg. �Don�t believe in wasting
time. My business, distribution and selling. World�s changing. Too many suppliers, too
much competition, too few customers. People tell me I need some of this
marketing stuff. Maybe they�re right. You seem like the man to do it. Talked to some people that know you. They seem to agree. So
what do you think?�

&nbsp;

�Well, Mr Clegg apart from the fact that I don�t
know you, I don�t know your company, I don�t know your products or your
customers and I have a perfectly good job at the moment; I can�t think of a single
reason to say no.�

&nbsp;

�Capital, capital,� beamed Clegg, �you�ll need a
sense of humour. Do you want some food or are you still feeling frail?� 

&nbsp;

He tossed a menu towards me. I looked down at the
food on offer. It all looked appetising but none of it appealed just then. �I
think I�ll pass, if you don�t mind.�

&nbsp;

A waitress appeared, blonde, coolly dressed in
charcoal grey shirt, tie and skirt with a black apron over it. She didn�t say
anything but took out her pad. Clegg ordered a gravadlax
starter followed by some monkfish. �Mineral water all right for you?� he asked
peering across at me.

&nbsp;

�Mmm, sure,� I responded.

&nbsp;

Clegg talked almost continuously about his views on
business. He barely paused when first the starter and then the main course
arrived. He talked and talked but I felt that the more he said the less I knew
about what it was that his business did. He obviously enjoyed the company of
women though as he kept up a suggestive banter with the waitress whenever she
appeared.

&nbsp;

The waitress reappeared with desert menus. Hermione
came back into the room as well. Clegg leant back in his chair and turned
towards Hermione. �I�ll have my usual,� he said. �My friend here will have a
sherbet.� He turned back towards me. �Trust me on this one.�

&nbsp;

Without a word and to my astonishment, Hermione
pulled one of the high backed chairs from the table bent forward over the back
and flipped up her skirt to reveal her naked rump. Clegg got up from the table
unbuckling his belt and unzipping his fly. I looked on in disbelief. As I was
doing so, the blonde waitress dropped to her knees beside me and, with
practiced skill, unzipped my fly, pulled out my cock and had it in her mouth
almost before I could react. A teasing, nibbling, sucking followed
demonstrating her abilities as a fellatrix in a way that quite took my mind off
of my hangover. Clegg, meanwhile, was working away at Hermione from behind her
back, squeezing and pinching at her tits by reaching around her. He carried on
with evident pleasure until he came with a grunt and turned to me with a smile.
�Enjoying your desert?� he asked as the waitress finally brought me to
orgasm.��� 

&nbsp;

The waitress zipped my fly and got up from her
knees as Clegg, backed away from Hermione. The two girls left us. Clegg
standing with his trousers still around his ankles,
poured a brandy for each of us and passed one to me. 

&nbsp;

I nodded in thanks for both the brandy and the
desert. It hadn�t been what I expected but my own firm was hardly above
offering similar inducements if the situation needed it and I�m not one to look
a gift horse in the mouth or to look a gift mouth in the mouth either. �Mr
Clegg, I have to admit that the, shall we say, fringe benefits offered by your
company seem attractive. But I still don�t understand what it is you buy or
sell.�

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry, old chap. I should have made it plainer� - don�t mean
to lead you up the garden path. It�s quite simple, really it is. Probably one of the oldest commodities on the planet.�

&nbsp;

�Uh,, huh,� I said, �and
that is�?�

&nbsp;

�Women, old chap, women.�

&nbsp;

I choked on my brandy in disbelief. �You must be
joking,� I exclaimed but I could see from his face that he wasn�t. In fact he
looked pained at the suggestion. �I�m sorry Mr Clegg, I might be interested in
a career move but I don�t think I�d consider working as a pimp. Prostitution is
hardly a legitimate line of business.�

�

Clegg tried to smooth me over. �I do believe you
should think carefully about this. It�s not such an extraordinary career move.
Some would claim that pimping is the ultimate form of marketing. Besides, I�m
not really talking about prostitution, it�s more about trading � we�re a
distribution company, I suppose. Let me give you an example of some of our
stock.� He reached into his jacket and pulled out a slim folder. He passed it
across to me. I opened it.

&nbsp;

Inside the folder were a series of photographs, all
of Rebecca. One thing that was clear from them was that Clegg was quite
ruthless in his treatment of his merchandise. Poor �Becca
was standing in a room somewhere. Her wrists were manacled and her arms were
chained above her head. She been gagged � a bright red ball was wedged between
her teeth. I assumed she�d been picked her up on the way back from the airport
- she was still wearing her uniform, or at least some of it. Her blouse was
torn open, one breast bare. Her skirt had been ripped as well, the dark welt at
the top of her tights clearly visible where the side seam had been torn from
hem to hip. Her hat was still perched incongruously on her head. She was
looking pretty sorry for herself. �I suppose this is blackmail,� I said to
Clegg.

&nbsp;

�Well, let�s say it�s more a sort of �golden
hello�. If you�re going to work for us we�d like to feel that you were fully
committed, at least until you�ve had the opportunity to demonstrate your value.�

Chapter
2: An Organisation

&nbsp;

I looked again at
the photographs. I�d often fantasised about having Rebecca like that but
somehow things had never worked out that way. I handed the photographs back to
Clegg. 

&nbsp;

�There�s only one
trouble with your suggestion though,� I said as I pulled an
envelop from my own jacket, took out the sheet of paper within and
handed it to Clegg.

&nbsp;

He peered at it
and read it out laughing, �Rebecca, I�m sorry. This will be a shock but there�s
no easy way to say it. I think we should end it. It�s not your fault. I guess
I�m just not ready for the sort of steady life I think you are looking for.� He
tossed the paper back to me. �Oh well, our intelligence isn�t as faultless it
seems. Still it seems like we�ve done you a favour. Never easy saying good bye
is it? And if you�re looking for a less steady life then working for us would
have a lot to commend it. I mean, it�s not like I was asking you to join a
tobacco company or something.�

&nbsp;

For some reason I
found myself warming to Clegg. �All right I said, tell me more. Well at least
tell me as much as you feel able to without having to kill me if I don�t decide
to go along with you.�

&nbsp;

Clegg grinned.
�Excellent,� he said, pulling up his trousers. �Have another brandy,
it�s the best cure I know for a hangover.�
If you�re sitting comfortably, then I�ll begin.�� 

&nbsp;

Clegg
started with a question. �How much do you know about slavery today?�

&nbsp;

It was
a bizarre question as a continuation of a bizarre encounter but I responded as
best I could. �Err, not much. I guess these days I mainly associate it with
eastern block countries, trafficking women into the west, women kept in
prostitution by drugs or threats of exposure to immigration authorities, that
sort of thing. Look is this really a safe place to discuss all this?�

&nbsp;

Clegg
smiled. �Oh yes,� he said. �When I said this was my club, I didn�t mean that I
was a member. It�s useful to have a base in London and the staff
are very discreet.� He went on. �Well, what you say is true but that�s
very much what I guess you marketing types call the bottom end of the market.
Not my area at all. Least ways not as far as the market goes; I�ve no objection
to Hermione�s bottom, none at all.� He grinned. �No, the area that I�m
interested in is rather more sophisticated, shall we say, and with rather
higher rewards.�

&nbsp;

�But slavery nevertheless?�

&nbsp;

�Yes,
I won�t deny it. It is very definitely about the trafficking of women.
Collected, rather as young Rebecca has been, prepared for their new lives and
sold on. Like all trading businesses mine has its costs, its revenue and, I�m
pleased to say, its profits. Most of our activity is concerned with the
collection side, lots of research for the most part, although occasionally
we�ll pick up inventory if the opportunity presents itself. We have one small
preparation centre.�

&nbsp;

�Preparation?�

&nbsp;

�Well,
you can guess how it is. Take Rebecca for instance. I imagine she�s fairly
sexually experienced?� 

&nbsp;

I gave
an affirmatory grunt, recalling some energetic
evenings and week-ends over the last year. �Yeah, pretty much.�

&nbsp;

�OK. Even so she won�t be used to the idea of being available as and
when required. I�m afraid that today�s young women have developed a
sense of independence that is not always conducive to our requirements. As and
when required is what our clients expect. And how required come to that. She�ll
need time to get used to that idea � our clients can be quite demanding � so
she�ll definitely need time. And some encouragement.
There�s a rather secluded location we use for that. We don�t do a lot of
preparation - we�re not what you�d call in the mass market and many of our
clients like them still to have a few rough edges to be smoothed out by themselves.�

&nbsp;

�So,
just the one preparation centre?�

&nbsp;

�Yes.
And then there�s the sales centre.�

&nbsp;

�What, like a car showroom? You�re joking.�

&nbsp;

�No,
not joking. And yes, it is pretty much like a car showroom. Especially
when we�re running an auction. Most go of the stock is for private sale
these days � a lot are commissioned collections anyway. That�s where the buyer
specifies the inventory and we arrange as requested. We still have the
occasional auction, though.�

&nbsp;

�Your clients?�

&nbsp;

�Wealthy, of course. Male, mostly
though there are exceptions. I think every continent is represented though there�s
a lot more activity in some areas than others. You do need a certain amount of
space and privacy if you�re going to keep slaves successfully. They�re not the
easiest of pets, as you can imagine.�

&nbsp;

�And
your problem with your business is?�

&nbsp;

�Like
I said, I think I need some of this marketing stuff. We�re successful but I�m
not sure we�ll go on being successful. We�ve lost a few clients recently. It�s
always hard to find out why but I get the idea that they�re getting a better
service somewhere else. Not that we�re bad, almost like someone else is better,
if you know what I mean. I�d want you to come in, tell us what we ought to be
doing and then see it through.�

&nbsp;

�It�s
probably the most bizarre proposition that I�ve ever had.�

&nbsp;

�That
doesn�t altogether surprise me,� Clegg smiled. �We may operate like an ordinary
business but I can hardly pretend that we are. Almost every thing we do is
illegal � that is apart from our tax and accounts; never sensible to upset the
revenue men, eh? Still it�s also likely to be the most lucrative proposition
you�ve had. If your Rebecca isn�t going to prove a point of leverage then you
should at least get a finder�s fee for her � that�ll come in at $10,000 for a
start.�

&nbsp;

�That�s
a finder�s fee?�

&nbsp;

�Well,
she�s an attractive piece. Useful skills too. There�ll
be no problem in selling her on and she won�t need too much training, not with
the job she�s been doing up until now. We�ll probably find a role for her with
someone flying their own private jet. There�s money in this business Larry, but
I do it for the love of it, really. We�ll put together a good deal but you�ll
find it fun, mark my words.�

&nbsp;

�Yes,
I can see that,� I said. �More fun than SaleWare
anyway. Look I�ve got a couple of good marketing execs over there that I�d like
to bring along with me. They�re good girls; smart and hardworking.�

&nbsp;

�I
thought we�d just start with you Larry, if that�s OK,� said Clegg. �Let�s see
how it goes. If we need more help I�m sure we can pick your girls up later on.�

&nbsp;

�Ah, I
see what you mean,� I said. It probably wasn�t fair to think about involving
them, though I had to admit that at least one of them would be very much
improved by the type of gag that had been used on Rebecca. �OK,� I said taking
a deep breath. �How do I start?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 3: On A Mission

&nbsp;

Clegg and I discussed it. I always like to
get a feeling for the business overall before I jump to any conclusions. Clegg
agreed and promised to set things up. �You�d better start at the sharp end,� he
said. �I�ll get you out with one of the snatch teams.�

&nbsp;

To say I was surprised was putting it
mildly. I�d never thought of myself as a law breaker, well not apart from
illegal parking and speeding. Still Clegg wasn�t the sort to beat around the
bush and I guessed he�d want to discover if I could stomach this stuff fairly
quickly. Actually I was more worried about what would happen if I found out I
couldn�t � or strictly speaking if he found out that I found out�.

&nbsp;

Not surprisingly the snatch team wasn�t
keen on having a stranger, and a beginner at that, along but Clegg had been
pretty insistent when he called them and told them I�d be joining them.

&nbsp;

A week later I was sitting in the passenger
seat of a non-descript van as we pulled up at a garage. It was a quarter to midnight, it was dark; we were the only vehicle on the forecourt.

&nbsp;

The driver turned to me. �Just don�t fucking foul this up, we�ve been setting this one up
for ages,� he said conversationally. I tried to look unimpressed. He climbed
out and went to the diesel pump. I heard him call into the microphone on the
side of the pump. �Hey, can someone give me a hand this pump�s not working.� 

&nbsp;

The speaker crackled back. �It should be
fine.� A girl�s voice. �Try again�

&nbsp;

My companion, Harry, spoke again. �No, not a thing.�

&nbsp;

More crackles. �Hang on I�ll come and have
a look.� That was my cue, I shuffled across to the
driver�s seat. I watched as the girl locked the shop behind her and then half
walked, half ran towards us, walking round the van to where Harry was standing
by the pump. I just heard a muffled squeak, a thump and the sound of the rear
doors opening and closing. Then there was a slap on the other side of the panel
behind my back and Harry�s voice calling, �Go!�

&nbsp;

I drove off, slowly and carefully as we�d
agreed. We�d gone about five miles I guess when there was another thump on the
panel behind me. We were out of town by then. I pulled over into a lay-by. As
the van stopped I heard Harry get out of the back. A moment later he was
climbing in and off we went again. �That seemed pretty easy,� I said.

&nbsp;

�It is if you prepare enough.� Harry�s
response was terse.

&nbsp;

�I mean, it could have been difficult. What
if she hadn�t come out?�

&nbsp;

�She always does. There wasn�t any doubt.�
He pointed to a side road. �Turn down there.� The road was dark. I almost
missed the gateway on the left hand side. �In here,� said Harry. �Over there,�
he waved, �into the barn.� I drove in through the open doors and stopped the
van. �Come and look at what we caught,� said Harry, getting out. He was more
relaxed now, but he still had his hand on the butt of the pistol in his
waistband as he pulled open the van�s doors.

&nbsp;

He needn�t have worried. Our captive � well
I felt I�d helped a bit � was lying, face down, on the floor of the van. I
climbed in. Harry had done a thorough job on her with duct tape. Several turns
were wrapped around her ankles and above her knees. There was more on her
wrists and he�d even taped her hands together wrapping tape around her fingers
as well. She was quite slightly built, she�d obviously given Harry no trouble
He turned her over. The tape had been used to good effect to gag and blindfold
her as well. Her face was almost covered with the grey, shiny tape, bulges
beneath it made clear that he�d packed her mouth and covered her eyes with pads
before using the tape. All that could be seen of the girls face was her nose.
She was breathing, slowly, quietly, apparently trying to listen for clues of
where she might be but unable to hear much because of the tape that covered her
ears.� 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�Well, what do you think?� asked Harry.

&nbsp;

I looked her over. She was slim, wearing a
pair of tight, low cut jeans. Her pink sweat top was stretched tight across
small breasts by the way the tape was wrapped around her chest and arms. The
top stopped inches short of the waist band of her trousers showing off a taught
belly that you could bounce a coin off and a silver ring through a piercing in
her navel. She�d evidently tried to struggle a bit during her ride - one of her
trainers had got kicked off - but she�d made no impact on her bonds.� With all the tape on her head it was
difficult to tell anything much apart from the fact that her short, spikey, blonde hair wasn�t naturally that colour. The
tabard she wore as her one concession to a fuel company uniform was a dull, brown,
nylon material that clashed with the pink top. A badge on her lapel said ��E6
Fuel Stops � Happy To Help� and her name, I assumed,
�Jackie�.

&nbsp;

�She seems safe and sound. Is there much
call for fuel pump attendants?�

&nbsp;

Harry grunted, bent down over the girl and
dragged her to the tail of the van. She squealed and tried to kick out. Without
much effort he hoisted her over his shoulder. �Don�t be fooled by appearances.
Let�s get her stowed, we�ll have a drink and I�ll fill you in.� As Harry stood
up Jackie was struggling ineffectually and trying to kick with her bound legs.
A door opened at the back of the barn. 

&nbsp;

In shuffled a little old lady of about
seventy. She wore a rather shabby grey dress with a shawl about her shoulders.
She was carrying a small wicker shopping basket. �Hello Harold,� she said
warmly. �Have you had a nice evening? I see you�ve brought another guest to
stay for a while. I�ll settle her in if you like.�

&nbsp;

Harry put Jackie back down on her feet.
Pulling a knife from his pocket he sliced through the tape that bound her
ankles. The little old lady walked up to her. �You come along with me, dear,�
she said quietly. Jackie turned towards the sound of her voice and gave a
puzzled, gagged, squawk. She tried to kick out. The little old lady gave a sigh
and took a small pistol from her basket. Beneath I could see an extraordinary
array of cuffs, shackles and gags. �Don�t be stupid, you dumb little cunt, this is a gun� the little old lady hissed, jabbing
the pistol against Jackie�s ribs and grabbing her arm. The turning to the two
of us, she smiled again. �Why don�t you boys go and have a drink?�

&nbsp;

�Sure thing, granny,� said Harry. 

&nbsp;

I followed him out of the barn and into the
farmhouse beside it. Minutes later we were sat beside a roaring log fire, each
with a glass of scotch in our hands. �So?� said Harry.

&nbsp;

�Like I said. Neat enough I guess but I�m not sure why you picked this one up.�

&nbsp;

�Intelligence,� he said, �that�s the answer
in this job. This one�s going to be a real asset. The garage job is just a
fill-in for her; paying off her student loan. She�s an undergraduate at the
university. Third year studying computer science and
mathematics. She�s been working on encryption algorithms. This one�s not
for trading, we�ll keep her in�house. She�s going to be very useful.�

&nbsp;

Still isn�t it a risky place for a pick-up?
There must have been CCTV on that forecourt.

&nbsp;

�Yeah sure. Here look.� Harry picked up the TV remote and the old television in
the corner of the room flickered into life. He tapped in a few numbers on the
control and we were watching a recording of the garage�s CCTV, views flicking
from the forecourt to the shop and back again. The pictures had been taken the
day before � Jackie was standing behind the counter in the shop, numbers at the
bottom of the screen gave the date and time as well as the camera number. A man
came to the service window. He was pointing to the pump we had been using.
Jackie went out to look at the pump and then came back into the shop. �Like I
said she always came out,� smirked Harry. �Quite a few people had problems with
that pump. Very handy, CCTV.�

&nbsp;

�But how do you do that? Won�t that have
got pictures of the pick-up?�

&nbsp;

�Let�s see,� said Harry, tapping more
buttons. The picture changed. The numbers on the screen indicated 11:40 p.m. No sign of anything on the forecourt, Jackie was behind the
counter. The numbers gave a jump. 11:55 p.m. A grey car pulled on
to the forecourt and the driver got out to try to use
a pump. He looked across to the shop and then walked over to hammer on the
service window. Disgusted to get no response, he went back to his car and drove
off. Midnight.

&nbsp;

�So where are we?�

&nbsp;

�There�s a terrible flaw with these digital
CCTV cameras. IP transmission through to the control room is very convenient
but the problem with digital stuff is that it�s really easy to intercept and
edit. Same goes for the number plate recognition stuff too. Probability is no
one will notice the glitch when they view it. We can redo the time stamping so
there�s no gap. That�s the sort of stuff we need young Jackie for.���� 

&nbsp;

�Granny� appeared with a beatific smile on
her face. �The young lady is all bedded down, boys,� she said. �These young
girls you seem to pick up with are always so bothered about the accommodation.
She was quite a handful, believe me.�

&nbsp;

�Thanks Granny,� Harry said. �We won�t be
long.� He turned to me. �You get to see all that you wanted?�� 

&nbsp;

�Is that it?�

&nbsp;

�Pretty much. She�ll stay here tonight. She�ll move on tomorrow. Granny�s got to
go out with a load of pigs for market. Young Jackie will share the transport.
�We�ve got a compartment under the floor of the trailer. It smells a bit of
course but she�s in no position to complain. Then we�ll transfer her over to a
better truck for the journey to the Prep Centre.�

&nbsp;

�Somehow I thought there would be more to
it. The pick up I mean.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, sure. This was a straightforward one but we like to make them as simple
as we can. It�s all in getting the venue and the timing right, I guess. No
point in making things difficult for yourself.�

&nbsp;

�No. Well thanks for that,� I said. �Any chance of a lift back to civilization?�

Chapter 4: Preparation Is Everything

&nbsp;

As it happened my visit to the Prep Centre
coincided with when the girl I had helped to snatch turned up.

&nbsp;

The Prep Centre was a big shed �
�Distribution Depot� it said over the outside � sitting like a great white shoe
box on the edge of a small airfield. A truck pulled up and backed on to one of
three loading docks at the right hand end of the shed. �F.C. Meat Products� it
said in large lettering across both doors and beneath it in smaller script,
�Prime Quality � Farm Fresh � Organic�, a telephone number and the web site
address �www.FC_Meat.co.uk�. 

&nbsp;

The doors at the back of the truck swung
open with a loud clang as they slapped back against the sides of the truck.
Inside there were four girls, taped up and gagged, strapped to the back wall of
the truck. They were all looking startled and scared.
I watched as each of the girls was loaded onto a four wheel trolley. A hook
from the frame held them up on tip toe by the tape or rope that joined their
elbows behind their backs. The trolleys were rolled off the truck, passing us
and off into the depot. Jackie was rolled off first; startled to see Harry and
me standing at the end of the truck�s ramp.

&nbsp;

�Don�t we need masks?� I said to Harry.

&nbsp;

�Oh no,� he said shaking his head as Jackie
was pushed away. �No masks except on operations, and
only then if there�s a risk that someone other than the target will see us. The
boss doesn�t like them. Says they encourage sloppiness � this way it keeps
people�s minds on the need to make sure our young ladies don�t wander off. We
don�t blindfold them either once they�re here, for the same reason.� Jackie was
squeaking quietly into her gag as she was wheeled away.

&nbsp;

Next off was a girl in a long, electric
blue, strapless evening gown. She was still wearing her jewellery � pearls and
diamonds so big they had to be fakes, though I guess they might just have been
real. �Hope she enjoyed her party,� Harry grinned. Just like Jackie, her mouth
was taped shut, cheeks bulging like an over-fed hamster. �The lads did a good
job when they picked this one up. With her mouth stuffed like that there�s no
risk of her making a noise. It�s no good just taping over their lips � they�re
likely to push the tape off with their tongues if you leave them for long.�

&nbsp;

The other two girls looked like they�d been
snatched off a tennis court. One in shorts, a blonde, the
other, mousey haired, in a short pleated skirt, both in white, both wearing
short sleeved tops and trainers. They�d used one trolley for the two of
them. Harry leant forward as the trolley came by. He reached out and groped the
blonde�s breasts. �These are nice,� he said, squeezing and pinching as the girl
tried to struggle away from him. �Not too big, nice and firm. I might get
together with you later on.� She looked at him, her eyes wide in terror, as the
trolley rolled her away.

&nbsp;

�Don�t you have to leave the girls alone,
then?� I asked. �I mean, shop-soiled merchandise and
all that.�

&nbsp;

�Nah,� said Harry. �We�re encouraged to. It
lets the girls know what they are in for from day one.�

&nbsp;

�That�s it - look cute and be ready for
pain �Chic and Ow�, we call it �,� said a voice from
behind me.

&nbsp;

�Bloody hell, Rick, your jokes don�t get
any better,� said Harry, turning round �This is Rick, he runs the place. Rick,
meet Lawrence � he�s doing some stuff for Mr. C.�

&nbsp;

I put my hand out to shake his.

&nbsp;

�Great,� he said, with a grin. �When Harry
met Larry.�

&nbsp;

�Whatever,� responded Harry, �Mr C, thought
he should have a look around. Can I leave him with you? I thought I might take
up some tennis lessons. See you later, Larry� Without waiting for Rick to
reply, he stalked off in pursuit of the trolleys.

&nbsp;

Rick gave a snort as he watched him go and
then pointed to a door at the other end of the loading dock. �Come on through,�
he said, �I�ll give you the grand tour.�

&nbsp;

Through the door lay a corridor with a
series of doors leading off it. �What�s through here?� I asked. �Cells? Weapons rooms?�

&nbsp;

Rick looked almost embarrassed and opened a
door revealing a few desks, some computers and two large filing cabinets. �Nothing so exciting along here. Just offices, I�m afraid.
All this stuff takes a load of admin. You�ve no idea how much effort we have to
put in just to keep track of where the girls are.�

&nbsp;

�Uh, huh, I grunted. I wasn�t hard to be
unimpressed.

&nbsp;

�This, though,� he went to open another
door, �is more interesting.�� The room
inside was a dark corridor. From it viewing panels looked into a series of
rooms each of which seemed to hold a captive woman. �Come on in � these are one
way mirrors in the cells, the girls can�t see us. Not that it would matter
anyway, I guess.���� 

&nbsp;

We stood beside the panel looking into the
room that held the party girl. Under the panel was a frame which held a card
with a number � 06/034 � and a name - Vivienne - after it in brackets.� She�d been stripped of her blue, silk, dress
but she was still wearing the underwear she had put on that evening, no doubt
in hopes of an intimate encounter different from that which she could soon now
expect. She had been left in her silk basque and
knickers, together with her stockings and shoes. The tape had been taken off
her wrists, elbows and ankles and now all that held her was a chain padlocked
to the wall at one end and her ankle at the other. The gag had gone as well but
I could see the red rash where they had pulled the tape from her face. The
screwed up tape and a wad of cloth lay on the floor beside her. Her cheeks were
tear streaked with mascara. Her hair was a mess - she
had put her long brown hair up but some of it had come loose in her struggles
and now tumbled across her naked shoulder. The room was empty apart from a
single, naked light bulb hanging from the ceiling and a small metal bucket.

&nbsp;

�OK,� said Rick, �this is how it starts. We
bring them in here and keep them in one of these rooms for a couple of days.
Mostly they think they�re being held for ransom fro some reason. Two days -
three days on their own; then they start to get a bit
twitchy. The cells are all wired and video monitored so we can keep an eye on
them. Let�s have a look in the next one.� We took a few steps along the
corridor. �This one�s been here for a week.�

&nbsp;

The girl in the cell looked less than
twenty years old but a haunted look in her eyes suggested that she had seen
more in the last week than in the rest of her young life. �06/022 (Anya)� the
label on the frame said. She was completely naked apart from a collar around
her neck with a small metal tag hanging from it. Her head had been shaved. She
wore the same chain as the girl in the cell next door.

&nbsp;

�Watch this,� said Rick pressing a button
on a panel below the viewing panel. A buzzer could be heard sounding in the
cell. Almost at once the girl got to her feet and turned to face the wall we
were looking through, she put her hands on her head and looked blankly towards
us. �That�s pretty good. After a week they�re already conditioned to respond to
simple instructions like that. It�s all part of encouraging them to get used to
doing as they are told. When they leave here, they are ready to be trained for
whatever specific role they are going to take up. We don�t do anything more
than get them set up for it.�

&nbsp;

The girl was standing only a foot from the
viewing panel. Red wheals were clearly visible across her breasts. �Do they
need much �encouragement� in the early stages,� I asked pointing at the marks.

&nbsp;

�That�s quite mild,� Rick said. �We haven�t
asked her to do anything difficult yet. She�ll still be in the state where she
thinks she can go along with some things but hold on to some control herself.
She�ll learn. Of course it�s difficult to strike a balance � enough
encouragement to get them to comply, not so much that they end up damaged.� He
pushed the button again, another buzz. She dropped her hands to her sides and
then sat down again on the floor. �Each little buzz, each piece of obedience
helps reinforce things. We don�t mind if it takes a while.� 

&nbsp;

The room alongside held the girl that Harry
had gone off in search of.� �06/038
(Carol)� her label said. As we walked by she was being manhandled, still bound
and gagged, into the cell. Harry followed her into the cell. �Put her ankle
chain on,� I heard him say, �and then I�ll see what
those titties are like close up.� He turned to the
girl. �Don�t be upset little cunt,� he said, almost
affectionately as he reached out a hand and cupped one of her breasts, �you�ll
have plenty of gentlemen callers while you�re here.�� She tried to pull away from him, earning a
slap on the face. He grabbed her by the hair and forced her back against the
wall of the cell. Pushing her sports top up over her breasts he started to
pinch and squeeze her tits.

&nbsp;

�That�s pretty much the shape of things
here - sex and violence,� said Rick as we walked on. By the time we send them
on they�re ready for what they�ll have to cope with.�

&nbsp;

We walked on passing five or six more
cells, all occupied by naked, chained, prisoners. At
the end of the corridor a door opened out into a brightly lit lobby area. At a
desk to one side, next to what was evidently the door to a parallel corridor
serving the cells themselves, a bored guard sat, working away at a cross-word
puzzle. Manilla folders were piled up on the desk in
three trays, Incoming, Outgoing, Storage. Rick walked across to the desk and
picked up one of the folders from the tray marked Storage. �Here you go,� he
said, passing it to me, �these are the sort of records we keep.�� 

&nbsp;

It was the file for the girl I had helped
capture. On the front the word �collected� had been stamped in red. Inside the
front cover was a full face photo and a form listing a
set of basic data; name, age, height and weight, vital statistics, home
address, work place. There was space for details of medical conditions,
educational qualifications, close associates. In the rest of the file were a
series of what seemed to be surveillance reports. There were more photos of
Jackie � her in a coffee shop chatting into her mobile phone, emerging from a
clothes shop clutching a large carrier bag and wearing a big smile, skipping up
the steps of the university library. The final document in the file was a short
memo which said. �Subject authorised for collection for internal use. Not for
re-sale. FC.�� I
handed it back. 

&nbsp;

�You see, we try to run a professional
operation.�

&nbsp;

�Sure,� I said, �why
wouldn�t you?�

&nbsp;

Rick showed me through another door. �These
are the research facilities,� he said. It looked just like another room full of
computers to me. �We do some from here, most of the major stuff is done
elsewhere but if we�ve got an opportunity for a pick up we can carry out the
basic checks � make sure they won�t be missed too quickly, that sort of
thing.�� 

&nbsp;

�Harry said you use video surveillance in
research,�

&nbsp;

�Oh sure, we keep any thing for the current
projects on a video server farm � we can call up anything we�ve got at one of
these work stations. Use it for planning or briefing the snatch squad as we
need to. Here, look,� he scrolled down a list of numbers,
until he picked out �05/209 (Caroline)�. A tap on the keyboard brought
up a further list, dates, times, locations. �These are all cross referenced as
we collect them. Some of the footage is from intercepted public systems,
sometimes it�s our own concealed cameras. Another tap on the button and the
file started to play. It was a bar. Sitting at it staring at a half empty glass
was a man. From the back it could have been anyone. �That�s Harry,� said my
host. He always likes at least one chance to get up close to the target. Say�s
you can�t really judge weight, agility, stuff like that, from video.

&nbsp;

A girl came into the bar,
the camera lens zoomed in on her, out of focus for a moment. She was a blonde,
wearing a v-neck sweater that clung tightly to a pair of tits as round as
grapefruit. She walked passed the camera and it panned back, following her
across the bar. Her arse was as nicely rounded as her tits. The bar was empty
but she stood right next to Harry. He looked up as she reached the bar. There
was no sign of the barman. She turned to Harry, �Can I get a drink here?� she
asked.

&nbsp;

�I guess,� Harry replied. �I got this in
living memory. You don�t look like the kind of girl anyone would let go short
of a drink for long.�

&nbsp;

�Well, thank you kind sir,� Caroline
answered. She was twisting a lock of her hair in her fingers as she talked,
looking straight at Harry. The barman came into shot. She didn�t notice him;
she was just looking at Harry. They talked some more. She was flirting, he was
flirting back. 

&nbsp;

He looked at his watch and apologised.
�Sorry, I have to go,� he said.

&nbsp;

�I may still be here later,� she said.

&nbsp;

�That would be great, I�ll maybe get back.�
He left her. She turned to the barman and ordered a vodka and tonic. He served
her. The video stopped.

&nbsp;

�And then?� I said. Rick picks another file
further down the list. The video started up again. This time it was dark, out
of doors. Harry was standing at the back of a large saloon car. He lifted up
the lid of the boot. The camera zoomed in. It was Caroline.� She was unconscious; gagged with silver tape
that reflects the lights from the video camera. The same tape was wound around
her chest and arms, just below her tits, it dragged
her sweater tight across her breasts making them look even fuller and firmer
than they did before. Harry smiled at the camera and dropped the lid of the
boot. The video stops.� 

&nbsp;

�Its not just video though,� Rick says
selecting another file. It was Caroline voice again. This time she sounded like
she was on the phone. She�s talking to an answering machine

&nbsp;

�Hey,� she said. �I thought I�d call you. Just popped back to the room. I met this cute guy and � well
you know me�.let�s see how it goes. Wish me luck.� The phone went dead.

&nbsp;

�Phone tap?� I said.

&nbsp;

�Uhhuh,� says
Rick. �Phone taps, bugs, anything really to get the background or limit the
risks. With that one we could hack the machine and wipe the message. Harry
doesn�t like leaving loose ends.� He smiled. �The other thing we do is to
record all the debriefing sessions we do here. Here, watch this�� He clicked on
a file labelled �05/224 (Jane)�. The video had been shot in a small room with a
single chair. Behind the chair was a door. It opened and two men pushed a tall
blonde girl into the room. She was wearing a white blouse and a straight black
skirt. She was wearing heels � they made her stand taller than the two men. Her
hair was quite short, cut close to her head giving her a curiously punkish look that contrasted with her conservative clothes.
She was gagged. They sat her on the chair and tied her to it. They took off her
gag and left the room. She was looking around to left and right. A disembodied
voice said, �Hello, Jane.� She looked startled, staring around herself, looking
for the source of the voice.

&nbsp;

�Where are you?� she sad. �Why am I here?
You�ve got to let me go. There must be some mistake.�

&nbsp;

The voice seems to sympathise with her. �Don�t
worry, Jane,� it said, �There are mistakes sometimes. I�m sure if there�s any
mistake we can soon sort it out. Perhaps you can help me?�� 

&nbsp;

�Oh,� Jane said, puzzled. �Help you? Why
should I help you? Why don�t you let me go?�

&nbsp;

�Well, Jane, I could but then if there
hadn�t been a mistake � then that wouldn�t be right would it?�

&nbsp;

Jane seemed confused. �Err, no, I guess not
but you can�t have meant to kidnap me.�

&nbsp;

�As I say, it�s possible that a mistake has
been made. Let me ask you some questions. In your office, tell me, are you the
only senior secretary?�

&nbsp;

�Oh no, there�s four of us.�

&nbsp;

�Ah, perhaps that�s the problem. Tell me
about the others.�

&nbsp;

�The others. Ah � there�s Angie. Actually she looks a bit like me, blonde too
but a bit shorter. Her parents are quite wealthy. They�ve got a yacht, she goes
off for long weekends, we never know whether she�s coming back on Mondays but
she doesn�t� seem to care � says she doesn�t really need the money. You must
have meant to kidnap her. Or, Louise. Oh, no I shouldn�t
be telling you this.�

&nbsp;

�It�s all right. You�re just helping me
out. We have to correct any mistakes, don�t we?�

&nbsp;

�I, I guess so, well, Louise she�s �..�

&nbsp;

Rick turned down the volume. �Will you look
at that,� he says. �She�s falling over herself to find something that will let
her get free. We�ll get enough information to pick up two of her three friends
over the next couple of weeks. You get that sometimes. If they don�t resist
then often they�ll be really cooperative. Makes our job easy but, hah,� He
flicked the video off in disgust. �I�m glad I haven�t got friends like that.
Anyway, where have we got to?� He scratched his head and thought for a moment.
OK let�s see. You�ve seen research, the reception cells, a little bit on
debriefing, something about the records and admin. I guess you should see
something of the processing that goes on after arrival.�

&nbsp;

�OK,� I said, �lead on.�� 

&nbsp;

Rick lead the way back out into the lobby.
Alongside the desk that guarded the entrance to the cells were three other doors,
each labelled with clear signs, Evaluation, Orientation, Despatch.
As we got back to the desk Jackie, now naked but still bound, was hustled
through the door from the cells. �Ah, here�s your little friend,� Rick said,
picking up her file. �Why don�t we go watch as some of the blank spaces in her
profile get filled in.�

&nbsp;

Jackie was kicking and struggling against
the two men holding her as she was half pulled, half thrown through the door
marked �Evaluation�. We followed her. Beyond the door was a small doctor�s
surgery. As we came in one of the men called, �Hey, Rick, since you�ve got her
file can you note the scores down?�

&nbsp;

�Sure,� Rick replied. Jackie was squealing
as they pushed her onto a pair of scales in one corner of the surgery.

&nbsp;

�Stop struggling, cunt,�
barked the man, cuffing her and sending her reeling against the wall. Dazed,
she stood as still as she could on the scales. �115lbs,� he called out to Rick.
He grabbed her by the arm and pushed her back against a height scale on the
wall. �5 feet four.�

&nbsp;

The other man picked up a tape measure from
the desk and pulled it around her chest, waist and hips. �34, 22, 32,� he
called out to Rick. �Looks like a B cup to me.�

&nbsp;

Rick was noting down the details as a
blonde woman in a white coat came in. �Another one?� she asked. �Where�s the
file?�

&nbsp;

�Here you go, Doc� said Rick passing it to
her. He gestured towards me. �This is �� he began. 

&nbsp;

�I know. Well don�t get in the way either
of you.� She turned towards Jackie, �Put her on the couch,� she said and then
walked across to stand beside her. �Now, young lady� she said quietly. �I need
a blood sample and a urine sample. You can either help me or you can be
difficult but you won�t like how I take the urine sample if it comes to that.
OK?�

&nbsp;

Jackie looked around at the two men, the
doctor, Rick and myself. She nodded slowly and grunted
an mmphed acceptance through the tape of her gag. The
doctor rolled her onto her face and stuck a hypodermic into her arm, She drew off a sample of blood into a small tube. She
tossed a stainless steel bedpan onto the couch alongside the girl. The two men
knew the drill and lifted the helpless Jackie onto it. �Let�s have it,� said
the doctor. Jackie whimpered and looked around again. The doctor slapped her. �Do it, or I�ll get a catheter,� she snarled.

&nbsp;

Jackie whimpered again as the ringing sound
of her pee hitting the steel of the pan confirmed her compliance. �Why the
urine sample?� I asked.

&nbsp;

�Pregnancy test,� the doctor replied as
Jackie was pulled off from the pan. �We don�t get many but it complicates
things if we don�t know early on.�� She
reached for a small jar on her desk and pulled a pair of disposable rubber
gloves from a box and wiped off Jackie with a wad of tissue. �On the other hand,�
she went on, �you�d be surprised how often I find little trophies hidden in the
most unusual places. Take her gag off.� 

&nbsp;

One of the men pulled the tape from her
mouth, she cried out as the tape ripped away from her skin. He prised out the
wad of sponge that had been filling her mouth. She barely had the chance to
squeal before the doctor crammed a Whitehead gag into
her mouth, ratcheting it open to force her jaws
apart. Picking up a torch she peered into Jackie�s mouth, running her fingers
inside. Apparently satisfied, she turned her attention elsewhere, pushing
Jackie back onto the couch and plunging her fingers into the girl�s vagina.
Jackie groaned as the doctor�s fingers probed inside her. The doctor ignored
her complaints and rolled her over once again, this time probing with her fingers
inside the girl�s anus. More gagged whimpers accompanied the doctor�s actions.
The doctor stood up and snapped off her latex gloves. She turned to the two
men. �Any sign of medication?�

&nbsp;

�No, nothing we could see in her handbag,�
one of them replied. �A half used pack of contraceptive pills and some headache
tablets was all she had that looked medical.�� 

&nbsp;

�Fine,� she noted down some comments in the
file and handed it back to Jackie�s guards. �I�ll add the test results later.
You can put her back in the cells now.� Jackie was pulled from the couch and
hustled away.

&nbsp;

�Thanks, Doc,� Rick said. �That�ll do us
for now, I think. You OK with that Larry?�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, sure,� I said, although it wasn�t
clear how this was helping yet.

&nbsp;

�OK,� said Rick, �let�s go look at
Orientation and Despatch.�

Chapter 5: Well Begun Is Half Done

&nbsp;

Rick showed me through the door marked
�Orientation� into another featureless corridor.

&nbsp;

�I�m not sure we really need a separate
area for this,� he said. �We could just as easily do their training down in the
reception block. Still we�ve got the space so I guess it doesn�t matter.
Anyways, it�s just the basics they get put through here; learning to cope with
simple commands, that sort of thing. Have a look at this one.� He pulled open
one of the doors. �She�s been here a few days now. Just starting to get the
hang of things, she is.�

&nbsp;

Hanging from the ceiling in the middle of
the room was a small cage, barely larger than the girl it contained. Inside it knelt a girl, blindfolded and naked, her wrists and ankles
shackled to the bars of the cage that held her. It was only as she lifted her
head in response to our arrival that I saw her collar and tag and the
stewardess cap. I realised it was Rebecca and I saw at once from Rick�s grin
that he knew who she was as well. �A friend of yours, Mr C tells me,� he said.

&nbsp;

I nodded. Rebecca, confused and traumatised
by her experiences, barely registered our presence. I looked at her feeling
sympathetic in one sense but curiously detached in another. Only
a week before we had been sharing a bed and yet now, somehow, it seemed quite
reasonable to see her like this.

&nbsp;

�They all spend some time caged, just to
get the hang of what they can look forward too if they don�t behave,� said Rick,
interrupting my thoughts. He swung the cage around. As he did so I could see
that a pair of vibrators had been pushed into her and then fixed rigidly to the
bars of the cage. He flicked a switch on the side of the cage and the vibrators
sprang into life. As they did so Rebecca gave a soft groan and began to wriggle
in time with the motorised thrusts. The cage swung right around. �No gag,
you�ll notice,� Rick went on. �She�s learning to keep quiet. If she manages to
take an hour or so of this without too much moaning she�ll be allowed out of
the cage for a while.�

&nbsp;

�Isn�t it, well, a bit brutal? I mean is it
really necessary to treat them like this?�

&nbsp;

�Nah. The way I see it, if we get them orientated properly they get an
easier ride with their owners. We can�t change the fact that they�re going to
be owned, but this way it should go better with them. By the time they leave
here they�ve left their previous lives behind. They can cope with what comes
next. I tell you, if your paths cross again she won�t even recognise you.� 

&nbsp;

�OK,� I said, �maybe I just haven�t got used
to this business yet.�

&nbsp;

�I know how it is. I was the same at first
but there�s been a lot of thought put into this whole process. If you like I
can have her put in a room for you afterwards. Nothing like
getting close to the product for seeing the benefits of the system.� 

&nbsp;

I thought about it for a moment but shook
my head. It didn�t seem like a great idea just then. 

&nbsp;

�Please yourself,�
Rick said. �I might have a go myself, Clegg doesn�t mind if we take the odd
hour off, providing it benefits some of our guest in one way or another. Anyway,
that�s basically how we do it. Simple tasks with rewards to
reinforce appropriate behaviour. Let�s have a look at the next one.�

&nbsp;

We left Rebecca swinging in her cage trying
to cope with her simple task of keeping quiet with the vibrators pulsing away
in her pussy and her arse. 

&nbsp;

�Here�s an interesting one,� said Rick. He
said opening the door to another cell where a naked, girl was kneeling, chained
by her collar to a steel pillar in the centre of the room. �This one was a
librarian,� he ushered me into the cell. �Turned out to be relatively sexually
inexperienced when we interviewed her and while that�s attractive to some folk
most buyers want some basic skills. We use this to train the ones that aren�t
very capable at oral sex. Look at this.�

&nbsp;

As we walked around the post I could see
that her mouth was round a large artificial phallus that projected from the
pillar. She was sucking at it enthusiastically. �Looks to me as if she�s
learning what she needs to here,� I said. 

&nbsp;

�Yes,� said Rick. �And as long as she keeps
that up she�ll be all right.� He saw my puzzled look. �Check out our little
book worm�s titties,� he went on. She had clamps on her nipples which wasn�t
unusual for the girls in the Prep Centre but from each ran a cable that
disappeared into the pillar. Her pace slowed as she tired. Almost at once she
squealed and bucked as an electric current shot down the cables. She set to
again, using her mouth with renewed energy.

&nbsp;

�And if she doesn�t there�s an electric
shock to reminder her what she�s supposed to be doing?
Ouch! How long does she have to keep that up?� 

&nbsp;

�She�ll do an hour today, a bit more
tomorrow. We�ll increase the time and increase the voltage over a few days. She
may not develop much technique but she�ll at least develop some stamina and it
should cure some of her gag reflex.�

&nbsp;

�How come?�

&nbsp;

�There�s a sensor in the tip of the
phallus. As long as she keeps it pressed against the back of her throat the
shocks take a little longer to develop.�

&nbsp;

�Impressive engineering,� I said.

&nbsp;

�Well, that�s one of Freddie�s personal
contributions. He�s good at that sort of thing. Seen enough of this?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, sure,� I said. As we left the cell I
heard the girl give another squeal and whimper. 

&nbsp;

�OK, here�s another of Freddie�s
engineering solutions,� he opened another door. Inside four running machines
were lined up facing the room�s one way mirror. On each a chained, corseted,
girl was walking slowly and carefully. �This,� Rick said, �we�ve
had to install because girl�s today just don�t know how to walk properly.�

&nbsp;

�It�s not a problem I�ve really noticed
myself,� I said.

&nbsp;

�No, you wouldn�t, but it matters to our
customers. Look what they�ve got on their feet.�

&nbsp;

Each of the girls was wearing shoes or
boots with extreme high heels. Two of them had on shoes with thick platform
soles.

&nbsp;

�Most of the girls we pick up spend most of
their time slobbing around in jeans and wearing trainers. They just don�t know
how to walk properly in heels and they�ll all need to do that when they come up
for auction. We don�t want them falling off their shoes like Naomi Campbell do
we? So we give them some acclimatisation here. They�ve rarely had any
experience of being corseted either. That changes their whole posture so they
need to get used to that too.�

&nbsp;

�I presume they�re chained to those
treadmills,� I said peering more closely. Every so often one of the girls would
slow her pace and then give a gagged yelp before stepping out again. 

&nbsp;

�Uhhuh,� Rick responded. �And you�ll see
that their tits are wired up just like the last girl.�

&nbsp;

�OK. So how does that work?�

&nbsp;

�Do you see -� at the back of each treadmill there�s
a little black box on either side? That�s a photo-cell and lamp arrangement. If
they slow down and get carried back by the belt they break the beam and zip.�

&nbsp;

�Zip?�

&nbsp;

�A quick shot of electricity through the
tits gets them going again. They don�t have to be fast, they just have to keep
up a steady pace. It seems to work.�

&nbsp;

�Our Freddie is an ingenious soul.� We left
the room as the girls walked on. 

&nbsp;

Rick showed the way to another room. It looked
more like the bar of a comfortable hotel than a dungeon cell. Rick sat down on
one of the deep padded armchairs. �Strictly speaking this is part of
�Orientation� but it�s also somewhere for us guys to take a bit of time off �
we give the girls a chance to practice their service skills here. Do you fancy
a drink?�

&nbsp;

I nodded in acceptance. �Why
not?� I said, �I�ve been in stranger looking bars than this.� To myself
I thought, stranger looking maybe but probably not, actually, stranger.
Remembering what Clegg�s club had been like in London, I hardly
thought that this would be any less bizarre. 

&nbsp;

I wasn�t disappointed. Rick pressed a
button. I response a door swung open and one of the girls teetered in on stilt
high heels, evidently she had at least succeeded in completing that aspect of
the training. In front of her she pushed a trolley containing an array of
drinks and glasses. I guess �high fetish� would describe the look. Her head was
encased in a skin tight hood of latex so thin that her features could be
clearly made out beneath it, as could the fact that her mouth was filled with a
jaw-breaking ball gag. Her head was held erect by a broad leather collar locked
about her neck with her number tag tangling from it. Her breasts were bared,
her only other garments, a waist cinching corset and a leather single sleeve
binder that held her arms locked behind her back.

&nbsp;

As she came up beside our couch I realised
that she was pushing the trolley by means of a bar that was fastened to a dildo
that was strapped into her, penetrating her vulva. 

&nbsp;

Another girl followed her into the room.
Similarly dressed she also appeared to have a plank strapped to her back. It
was only as she knelt in front of us that I realised it was her role to act as
our drinks table. Rick picked a beer bottle and glass from the trolley and
stood them on the table. �Help yourself,� he said
waving to the trolley girl. I assumed he meant drink, although the girl�s
reaction suggested that she was equally expecting me to take advantage of other
services.

&nbsp;

I restricted myself to joining Rick in a
beer. He took a sip from his glass. �These two have been here a couple of
week�s now,� he said. �They�re fairly docile. They�ve learnt to do as they are
told, although this one,� he reached forward and pinched one of the trolley
girl�s nipples, �this one still thinks she can decide when she�s going to
behave and when she isn�t. Don�t you?� 

&nbsp;

The girl shook her head slowly, the
movement impeded by the rigid collar that she wore.

&nbsp;

�Well, that is good news,� said Rick,
smiling. �We�ll be able to get you helping with the training of the new girls,
then.� The girl looked distressed, shaking her head again. Rick turned back to
me. �You have to keep racheting things up. As soon as they think they�ve given
in you find a new hurdle for them to jump over. That way you build up the
submissive response over time. This one,� he pointed to the table, �is doing
much better. She�s pretty well jumping through any hoops we put in front of
her. We�ll move her on to her owner within a week.�

&nbsp;

�She�s been bought then?� I asked.

&nbsp;

�Yeah, that�s not so common now. It used to
be that almost all of them were picked up to order so they were bought before
we�d grabbed them. Nowadays we�re auctioning more and more of them. That�s not
so good - it�s never certain what you�ll get for them and the market�s been a
bit flat lately.�

&nbsp;

�How come you�re not grabbing so many to
order?�

&nbsp;

�I�m not sure why the commissions have
dropped off. I guess there�s competitors out there
offering better rates. Guys in the Sales Centre would have a better idea, I
guess.�

&nbsp;

I made a mental note to add that to my
thinking on Clegg�s marketing problems. I needed to remind myself I was
supposed to be working, though it was pretty difficult, supping beer in the
company of two virtually naked women.

&nbsp;

Rick downed the last of his beer. �Anyway,
I was going to show you Despatch,� he announced, getting to his feet. �Fuck
off, sluts,� he barked at the girls. The table shuffled slowly, away on all
fours, taking care not to dislodge the empty bottles and glasses still balanced
on her back. The trolley followed her, each step causing the dildo attached to
the trolley handle to push into her cunt. The gag only served to make her
muffled whimpers sound more plaintive.

&nbsp;

�OK,� said Rick. �Let�s move on.� We
stepped out of the room, back into the corridor and on into a loading dock.
�Well,� he said, gesturing, �this is Despatch. We either ship direct to the
customer or via the sales centre. Shipping to the Sales Centre is the easiest
of course � it�s only about three hours from here by road so all we have to do
is make sure the consignments are in here just before the trucks turn up and
that they�re securely packed. �Ship to Customer� is a bit more of a challenge.
It�s usually overseas � airfreight mostly � and the flight times are often ten
hours or more. We use standard airfreight containers like these � modified a
bit. Here, I�ll show you � this one�s going out in about an hour.�

&nbsp;

Rick pulled open the side panel of the
container, inside there were two couches set side by side. On the nearer was
strapped an almost naked, partly conscious girl. She turned her eyes slowly
towards us as the panel opened, aware of the sudden bright light. Her mouth and
nose were covered by an oxygen mask that was held in place by tape that seemed
to cover most of the rest of her face. Her eyes flickered and she sank back
into sleep.

&nbsp;

�Drugged?� I asked.

&nbsp;

�Uh huh,� responded Rick. �It�s the kindest
way really. She�s almost unconscious, so it minimises the risk of her doing any
harm to herself by struggling.� We walked over to the container. The girl
couldn�t move; straps around her forehead, arms, chest, belly, thighs and
ankles held her in place on the couch. I could see that when the side panel of
the container was closed foam padding would restrict her even more. A breathing
tube ran from the mask to gas bottles below her couch. A small gauge on the
bottles showed they were 90% full. All the girl was wearing was a pair of
padded pants. Rick saw me looking at them. �Well, she can�t get out of the hold
to go use the washroom,� he said. �We keep them off liquids and use diuretics
for a day before shipment and the drugs suppress the production of urine but
there�s always a risk of spillage.�

&nbsp;

�Where�s she going?�

&nbsp;

�Err, not sure. Let�s see.� He reached
across to the girl�s couch, in a pocket by the side
was a folded document. He opened it out. �Shipment note,� he said, explaining.
He read it. �Oh yeah, I remember this one. She was a bit unlucky.�

&nbsp;

�Unlucky?�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, We had a
very nice snatch set up. We were picking up a student, Carol � degree in modern
languages; very bright, doing post graduate studies in Russian. That�s very
useful at the moment both from the point of view of new acquisitions and for
some of our new customers too. So we monitor our little student�s house and get
her pattern of movements. It�s the end of term so she�s not going to be missed
for a few days at least, weeks maybe. We�ve got the whole thing set up. A
little light jemmy work at the back of the house; get
ourselves; set up wait for her to come home that evening; nice quick grab and
bag and Robert is very much your father�s brother.�

&nbsp;

�But it wasn�t as easy as you thought?�

&nbsp;

�Well, yes and no. Getting in was no
problem. The snatch team had no difficulties at all. Only problem is they�re
just sorting out their stuff in the hall when they hear a voice from upstairs
calling �Carol, is that you?� and they realise that the brown smelly stuff is
in the fan.�

&nbsp;

�Ah, not your actual cunning linguist
then?���������� 

&nbsp;

�You catch on quickly my friend, no, not
our linguist at all. Anyway the lads are crouched under the stairs as our
friend over there comes down stairs. She�s been in the shower; she�s wearing a
towelling robe; she�s got a towel around her head and nothing else. The lads
had no choice really, so when she gets to the bottom of the stairs they jump
her. She puts up quite a fight � turns out later she trains at a gym � both the
lads end up with bloody noses and one with a considerable pain in his crotch.
However they manage to subdue her and strap her wrists with the belt from her
robe. They weren�t too gentle but then having your balls kicked tends to cause
your judgement to suffer. It definitely was not the girl they were looking for;
the towel has come off her head and even the dimmest of our snatch teams can
tell the difference between a blond and a brunette. The real target is not due
home for another three hours and this one is busily trying to bite her way
through the hand that�s keeping her quiet. Well to cut a long story short they
find some stuff to gag her with � I think it was her face cloth and a pair of
tights she had hanging on the bath rail � and hog tie her on her bed. Well,
much as they might enjoy the prospect of a young lady trussed up wearing
nothing but a bath robe, they at least know that they�ve got to sort things
out. They make a couple of calls and we decide to bring both of them in. They make
sure this young lady can�t wander off and wait for the real target to turn up.�� 

&nbsp;

�So Carol�s house guest
gets to join her in an exciting new life.�

&nbsp;

�Well, sort of. Having brought her in it turns
out that the house guest here doesn�t really have much in the way of any specific
skills we need, so we�ve just sold her on. Got a reasonable price which will
cover the overheads but that�s about it. Anyway, the irony is that this one�s
off to a little dacha near Kharkov, so she might end up learning some Russian a bit more quickly than
her friend, though my guess is she won�t be reading Chekov or Turgenev.�

&nbsp;

The girl slumped back in her couch, the
effects of the drug overtaking her. Rick put the shipment note back in its
pocket, lowered the panel of the container and fastened it.

&nbsp;

�Do you get many problems like that? Unplanned stock?�

&nbsp;

�Not as much as you�d think. The research
is usually good enough. And usually we can off-load them. It just seems a bit
unfair, somehow. I must be getting soft in my old age. Let�s have a look at this
other one. She�ll be on this afternoon�s truck to the Sales Centre.� Rick
pointed to a cable drum on the far side of the loading bay. We walked across.

&nbsp;

After the relative comfort of the long haul
container, the poor girl being shipped out to the Sales Centre was clearly
going to have a more difficult ride. She obviously hadn�t had the benefit of
any tranquilising drugs. As we approached the drum the distinctive sounds of
complaint muffled by a mouth filling gag could be heard.�� 

&nbsp;

Rick rolled the drum away from the wall.
The grunts of complaint got louder. I had to admit the way that the cable drum
was being used was ingenious. As Rick swung it around I
could see that the girl had been strapped in place, face up, around the core of
the drum. She was naked apart from the straps that held her tightly against the
drum�s core. �Toss me those slats,� Rick called pointing to a pile of short
pieces of wood. I passed them across to him one at a time as he fitted them
inside the drum until they made a second outer core, completely enclosing the
helpless girl and making her gagged grunts sound still quieter. �There we are,�
said Rick, �a convenient package we can roll straight onto a truck.� 

&nbsp;

I realised there were four other drums on
the loading dock. �Are all those the same?� I said
pointing. I looked at the drums. On each was stencilled the words �FC
Components Ltd. �Plug &amp; Play� Wiring Harness &amp; Cables�. 

&nbsp;

�Yep,�� said Rick, �that�s the results of the last
week�s orientation. They�ll be in the Sales Centre tonight. There�s an auction
at the weekend and then they�ll be off to their new owners. 

&nbsp;

Chapter 6: Hands On

&nbsp;

Freddie had got an office for me in the
run-down block that he used on the edge of the city. �FC Enterprises� it said
on a dingy plate by the door. The whole building looked pretty dingy. The up
side was that I could get to Brick
  Lane for a good curry at
lunch time. The down side was that even if I didn�t feel like a good curry I
could still smell it all day. 

&nbsp;

Upstairs there were researchers and the
accounts department. I was sitting in my office, going through my thoughts
after my visit to the Prep Centre. What worried me was how normal it all felt,
how easily I seemed to have slipped into accepting the ideas, the whole basis
behind this bizarre business. A few weeks ago I wouldn�t have believed there
was such a place as the Prep Centre in the heart of England.
Now I was trying to work out ways to make best use of it. I suppose I ought to
have had some moral scruples about the whole thing but I guess I was just
focused on the problem. It�s one of my faults, I know, solving the problem at
hand even if I should really be thinking about other stuff. 

&nbsp;

I was thinking about the trip up to the Sales
Centre when the phone rang.

&nbsp;

It was Freddie. �Morning, Lawrence,� he
boomed. �All well at the Prep Centre?� He didn�t wait for an answer. �Good, good.
Now tell me, do you know an Amanda Hollis?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, sure,� I said, �she�s a friend of
Rebecca�s, works for Atlantic Airlines too. They used to crew together
sometimes.�

&nbsp;

�Word is that you two used to �crew�
together occasionally as well when Rebecca wasn�t around?�

&nbsp;

As I was beginning to appreciate, Freddie�s
intelligence network was extensive. 

&nbsp;

�That was a long time back,� I said.

&nbsp;

�Good, good. Then you won�t have any
objection to us adding her to the collection?�

&nbsp;

As always I was non-plussed by Freddie�s
matter-of-fact approach. Thinking about it, compared with the rest of what I�d
been involved in over the past weeks, it was hardly much of a problem. I hadn�t
seen Mandy for six months � somehow she and Rebecca had always been on the same
trips for a while. And anyway it hadn�t been much more than a shared physical
thing � Mandy was fairly energetic between the sheets, if you know what I mean
� so I couldn�t say that I had any real reservations about Freddie�s proposal.
�No,� I said, �not really.�

&nbsp;

�Excellent, excellent,� beamed Freddie. �Thought that would be the case. It�s just that she�s been
kicking up a bit of a fuss over her friend�s disappearance and that could be a
bit inconvenient. I thought you and Harry could deal with it. You seemed to get
on all right with the last one.�

&nbsp;

I was conscious that I hadn�t been more
than a spectator at the garage job but Freddie didn�t seem to want to be
diverted by practicalities. �Sure,� I said, feeling less than confident, �leave
it to me.�

&nbsp;

�And make it quick can you,� Freddie came
back. �I�d like to get her in before she causes any ripples.�

&nbsp;

Harry was hardly what you could call happy
when I spoke to him. The broad gist of his remarks was along the lines that he
thought we didn�t really have enough time to do a proper job and that flight
attendants were always a problem, �cos you never knew if they were going to get
re-rostered and you�d find all your plans in the skip. Since it was my fault
(not sure I quite understood that bit) I could do the hard work. 

&nbsp;

I say the broad gist because it was
sometimes quite hard to make out his exact meaning in between the various
expletives.

&nbsp;

We talked through Mandy�s likely
whereabouts. Harry�s view was that her flat was the best bet � he was fed up
with trying to find good pick up points in airports and the muzak in Heathrow
Terminal 3 drove him mad. He also �suggested� that I could make up for the fact
that I�d obviously caused all this rush by setting up the snatch myself.

&nbsp;

I gave her a call. She was pleased to hear
from me. She was worried about Rebecca. �So am I�, I said, �why don�t I come
round and we can talk about it.� 

&nbsp;

�I�d like that,� she said.

&nbsp;

So that evening I was standing outside her
door with a chloroform soaked pad in a sealed plastic wallet in my jacket pocket
and very clear instructions from Harry once again not to �fuck this one up
either.�

&nbsp;

Amanda let me in. She was looking cute.
Like I say, I hadn�t seen her for a while. It looked as if she�d dropped a few
pounds. She was wearing a shirt and jeans, they were tight and I liked the
effect. She�d left the shirt unbuttoned enough to show a hint of cleavage. I
guessed that her thoughts weren�t entirely on Rebecca. She fixed us both a
drink.

&nbsp;

�Have you heard anything from Becky?� she
said. �We were supposed to do a trip together on Monday and she didn�t show up.
It�s not like her and I know you two were, well, seeing quite a lot of each
other.�

&nbsp;

�No,� I said, peering at the vodka and
tonic she�d brought. �No, I haven�t seen her for a while. Things were, well,
you know how it is.�

&nbsp;

�She didn�t say. I mean I thought you were
still together. If I�d known I might have given you a call.�

&nbsp;

�That might have been nice.� I downed the
vodka. She smiled in return.

&nbsp;

�Can I get you another?� She sank her own
drink.

&nbsp;

�Mmm, please.�

&nbsp;

Amanda picked up the two glasses and headed
towards the kitchen. I followed her and thought that now was as good a time as
any to make my move. I slipped the plastic wallet from my pocket and pulled out
the pad. I caught up with her just as she reached the refrigerator looking for
some ice. I was surprised how easy it was. The pad went over her nose and
mouth, her arms flew out and the glasses cart-wheeled across the room to
shatter on the floor. She gave a muffled squeal as she gasped for breath but all
that did was to give her more of the drug. I got my other arm around her chest.
That stopped her arms flailing. She tried to break free of my grip but I had
her held tightly and soon her struggles subsided. I felt her go limp and let
her slide to the tiled floor of the kitchen. �How easy was that?� I thought.
�Even quicker than Harry had said.� I pulled out my mobile to give Harry a
call. No bloody signal.

&nbsp;

I went back into the living room and the
signal improved. I tried Harry�s number again �Hi,� I said. �Smooth as a nut.
Bring the car round the back and we can go out down the fire escape as we
agreed.�

&nbsp;

�O.K.� said Harry. �Open up, I�ll be there
in a minute.�

&nbsp;

The fire escape was through Mandy�s bedroom
window. Sure enough, moments later, Harry appeared outside. I pulled up the
window and he climbed in. He looked around. �Where is she then?�

&nbsp;

�In the kitchen,� I said, pointing the way
out through the bedroom door. �She went out like a light. It was even easier
than you said.� He followed my pointing finger.

&nbsp;

Harry came back almost immediately. �In the
kitchen, you said?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, sure why?�

&nbsp;

�It�s just that there�s a lot of broken
glass in there but, unless this lady is particularly petite, I don�t see her
there.�

&nbsp;

I barged past him into the kitchen but sure
enough Amanda wasn�t there, just the broken glasses and the discarded
chloroform pad. 

&nbsp;

�You did give her plenty of it?�

&nbsp;

�Yeah sure. Well, hey, I�ve not had any training in this. How am I to know?
Look she can�t be far away. She can�t have gone out through the front door, I�d
have heard her. She must still be in the flat somewhere.�

&nbsp;

�Let�s hope so. We�d better go look, hadn�t
we?�

&nbsp;

Harry started checking the cupboards in the
kitchen. I went back into the living room. As I stepped in, she was standing behind
the door. I didn�t hear anything until she hit me with the vodka bottle. The
next thing I know is I�m on the floor with a headache worse than the one I had before
my first lunch with Freddie. 

&nbsp;

Moments later Harry came back into the
living room. He was half pushing, half carrying a struggling Amanda. He�d got
his hand over her mouth but underneath it I suspected that Mandy�s language was
every bit as colourful as Harry�s had been earlier. 

&nbsp;

�I think you lost something,� said Harry,
grinning. �Now if you could find something to make sure our young friend
doesn�t wander off again and something to keep her quiet too, that would be
really helpful. And you,� he turned to Amanda, �quit struggling or you�ll get
another dose of that pad and I�ll keep it on for long enough this time. Plus
it�s covered in broken glass which will make a mess of that pretty face of
yours.�

&nbsp;

I had a look around her bedroom and grabbed
a couple of scarves and some pantyhose. I took them back to the living room
where Harry had wrestled Mandy to the floor and was sitting astride her back. I
tossed him the stuff. �Yeah,� he said. �That�ll do.� He pulled Mandy�s wrists
together behind her back and tied them there before tying her ankles too. He
rolled her over on to her back. She was scowling at the two of us.

&nbsp;

�What the hell is this all about, Larry,�
she gasped, �Is this some kinky game? What on earth�s going ounggh.�� Harry cut her off by wedging one of the
scarves into her mouth. He tied a knot in the middle of the other one, pushed
that into her mouth over the other scarf and knotted it off behind her head.
Amanda gave a groan.

&nbsp;

Harry sat her up and turned to me. �Now why
don�t you go pack the young lady�s case like we agreed and we can be on our
way?�

&nbsp;

Embarrassed by my poor
showing. I scuttled off to do as he asked. The
idea was to make it look like she�d decided to go away for a few days. So I
picked out a selection of clothes and underwear and put them in a case. Harry
had said to bring her work uniforms and airport passes as well, so they went in
too. 

&nbsp;

It didn�t take long but by the time I�d got
back Harry was already amusing himself. Somehow Mandy�s blouse had come
unbuttoned and Harry�s hands were all over her tits. She was wriggling to avoid
his attentions but the panty hose knotted around her wrists and elbows meant
that she wasn�t having much success. The scarves made sure that her objections
weren�t heard.

&nbsp;

�Hope you don�t mind Larry,� he said. �I�m
a sucker for a well filled blouse, if you�ll pardon the expression and this one
had a rather pleasant pair of tits inside it. You got the case? OK, let�s take
little Mandy here for her trip.� He reached down, picked her up and threw her
across his shoulder. She kicked out a bit until he slapped her backside. �Don�t
be a silly, girl,� he said, heading for the bedroom and the fire escape. I
followed him carrying Mandy�s bag.

Chapter 7: Red Sales In The Sunset 

&nbsp;

Clegg called me the following day. �Good
job on the Hollis pick up,� he said. �Knew I could rely on
you.�

&nbsp;

�Well, I�m not sure I�m suited to field
operations. It wasn�t quite as straight forward as it should have been.�

&nbsp;

�No,� said Freddie. �So I heard. Still
never mind. Harry seemed to think you did all right, all things considered. It
ended up clean, That�s the main thing. Anyway � Sales
Centre � you said you wanted to see it. Suggest you get up there today. That�s
if your headache is better.�

&nbsp;

I could almost hear the smirk. �Fine. Thanks. I�ll get on my way,� I said.

&nbsp;

The Sales Centre looked impressive from the
moment I first saw it. It was a large, modern, building clad in stainless
steel, overlooking a lake and parkland. It looked like a very upmarket car
dealership and the Ferraris parked in front certainly added to that impression.

&nbsp;

I�d been invited to watch an auction. By
the time I arrived the buyers were already in place, chatting away one to
another. The first lot was already on the block � my erstwhile girl friend,
Rebecca.

&nbsp;

The auctioneer was standing on a small
podium to one side of a stage. �Gentlemen, welcome. Our first lot this morning
is #06/078, caucassian, 24 year old female, fully
trained as a flight attendant, fluent in French and German as well as her
native English. Recently acquired and prepared to level one. You�ll see in your
catalogue that�. �

&nbsp;

Rebecca was sitting passively on a stool in
the middle of a raised stage, her hands clasped loosely together in her lap,
make up perfect. She was staring blankly ahead across the group of buyers that
were lounging on couches in of the platform. She seemed almost unaware of her
surroundings. She was wearing her Atlantic Airlines cabin crew uniform. The
dark blue jacket and skirt were clean and pressed, her white blouse starched
and fresh, her forage cap perched on immaculately back-combed and lacquered
hair. 

&nbsp;

�78,� the auctioneer called, �if you could
let these gentlemen see you move please.�

&nbsp;

Rebecca looked across of the auctioneer and
got slowly to her feet. Without a word she walked slowly from left to right
across the stage, turned to face the buyers and then walked back to stand
beside the stool. As she did so I realised that the heels she was wearing were
higher than anything she�d have normally worn on-board and her skirt had been
altered to make it narrower, giving her walk an agreeable wiggle.

&nbsp;

�Your jacket, please,� the auctioneer said.
Rebecca slipped the jacket from her shoulders and placed it neatly on the
stool. �And turn, please.� Rebecca turned around, giving the audience a good
view of her body. �Open the blouse.� She stood still and unfastened the buttons
of her blouse without protest. As she let it fall open I could see that she was
wearing a white under-wired bra that was presenting her tits to the best
advantage. She normally wore something with a softer line. I had to admit I
preferred the new look. She let her hands fall to her side. �And
the skirt, please.� She unfastened the waist band and stepped out of her
skirt, placing it on top of her jacket. She was wearing stockings, a plain
white garter belt and white panties. These guys evidently know how to get a
girl to do what they want, I thought. I�d been trying without success to get
Rebecca to wear stockings ever since I met her, but then I hadn�t tried
shutting her up naked in a cage as a way of convincing her that I had the right
ideas about how she should look. I wondered if they�d had her on the fellatio
trainer too. �And turn again.� Rebecca did as she was told. I looked at the
group of buyers, they were nodding approvingly. �There we are, gentlemen. I
think you�ve all had the opportunity to examine this lot. I have a number of
initial offers so I would like to start the bidding at $60,000, Eu72,500 or 6.9M Yen.�

&nbsp;

There was a flurry of response in the room.
Bids ran quickly up to $90,000 but then slowed. The auctioneer walked over to
where Rebecca was standing. �Come along, gentlemen, please,� he said �I�m sure
we can do better than that.� He clicked his fingers and pointed to the floor.
Rebecca dropped obediently to her knees. �Very responsive, you see gentlemen
and with some unique skills from her airline training.�

&nbsp;

One of the bidders to my left was muttering
into a mobile phone. He waived his catalogue to indicate a further bid. More
bids followed and the price skittered up to $130,000 before stalling again.
�Are we all done, gentlemen?� the auctioneer asked. �It�s in the room at
$130,000 Against you, sir,� he nodded to the man on
the mobile phone. �For the last time, at $130,000. No
more?� The man with the mobile phone shook his head. �$130,000
then.� Rebecca peered into the audience, looking scared. She looked back
towards the auctioneer as the gavel came down. �Sold!
Thank you.� 

&nbsp;

As soon as the gavel came down a man
appeared on the platform with a pair of handcuffs. He waited for the few
moments that Rebecca took to get dressed before cuffing her wrists behind her.
The auctioneer said, �Client 1033.� The man wrote the number on a label and
fastened it to the collar around Rebecca�s neck. He grasped her arm and led her
from the stage. The auctioneer turned back to the audience. �Our next lot is
#06/082,� he said as another girl was led onto the stage.

&nbsp;

The buyer who had been successful in his
bid for Rebecca got up from his seat. He was a thin man, a little shorter than
me, blinking short sightedly at his surroundings. I
approached him as he went to leave the room. �I wonder if I could have a word,�
I said.

&nbsp;

He looked at me myopically, peering through
thick lensed glasses. �Yes,,
Yes, of course. You�re Clegg�s new man, aren�t you?�

&nbsp;

�Err, yes, Larry, Larry Ross� I replied,
surprised that news of my appointment had been shared with Clegg�s clients.

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry,� he said, �Clegg and I go back
a long way. He told me he was bringing in someone to help with the business.
I�ll be interested to see what you make of it. I�ve been buying here for years
and I�ve had some good pieces from him. This one�s going to be handy for my new
business jet.�

&nbsp;

�Were you pleased with the price?� I asked.

&nbsp;

�Yes,� he said, �not bad at all. I thought
it was going to be even better at one point but that phone bidder kicked it up
a bit. That�s what I like about Clegg�s sales, there�s
often quite a small number of buyers. Means that prices
stay sensible if you get my drift.�

&nbsp;

I nodded, hoping to get him to talk further
but he made his excuses to go.

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry, I really need to go and arrange
shipment details for that young lady. There�s another lot I�m interested in a
little later on and I�d hate to miss it.�

&nbsp;

�Of course,� I said. �I don�t mean to hold
you up. Enjoy your purchase.�

&nbsp;

�Thank you,� he said. �I really think I
will.�

&nbsp;

I watched as some more lots went under the
hammer. Each time the girl was brought out, told to exhibit herself
by removing some or all of her clothes and then subjected to the humiliation of
hearing the bids called out.� 

&nbsp;

The auction came to and end. The buyers
began to disperse. 

&nbsp;

I heard a voice behind me. �Larry, can I
have a word.� It was the auctioneer. �Hi,� he said, �we haven�t been introduced
yet. I�m Brian � I run the Sales Centre, Freddie asked me to look after you.�

&nbsp;

�Well thanks Brian. The auction seemed to
go OK.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, not too bad. We could have done with a few more buyers. The prices weren�t all
I�d hoped for. Still, the stewardess fetched a good price. Better than
expected.�

&nbsp;

I thought back to what her buyer had said.
I wondered who had the better idea. I said, �This is a pretty impressive
place.� 

&nbsp;

�Glad you think so,� said Brian. �Come and
see some of the stock.� He gestured to the door that the girls had been brought
through. We walked down a corridor similar to the one at the reception centre,
its glass panels looking into a series of cells. Given that a sale had just
finished I was surprised by how many girls were still there.

&nbsp;

Brian suggested that we stopped by one of
the cells and listened in. There were three of them in there; all naked and
chained but not gagged. They each wore a collar from which a chain ran to a
ring set in the wall. On a low table in one corner of their cell stood four
beakers and four metal plates that held the remains of a meal. Brian flicked a
switch on the wall and a speaker crackled into life above our heads. The girl
sitting on the floor with her back to us was speaking, the others looking at
her. ��. after all if that�s what needed.�

&nbsp;

�No, Sally,� a dumpy brunette standing
opposite her folded her arms. �Can�t you see that�s just giving in to them?�

&nbsp;

�We�re not supposed to use names,� a
redhead standing beside Sally said. �Please don�t use names, they might be
listening.� 

&nbsp;

�And you,� the brunette was scornful,
�you�re every bit as much help to them as you can be, Anna and what are you
getting for it? Is your chain any longer than mine? Is your collar not as tight
as mine? Are you raped less often?�

&nbsp;

Anna hung her head. �No, no. It�s just that
we should do as we are told. It will be easier for us.�

&nbsp;

�Easier for them, you
mean. You can give up your name if you like.
I�ll hang on to mine as long as I can.�

&nbsp;

�Why weren�t we sold today? There was a
sale today, I�m sure.�

&nbsp;

�Who the fuck knows? What does it matter, Sally? What does it matter? We�re still here.
Maybe we can get out of here.�

&nbsp;

�Perhaps it�s because you�re so difficult.�
Anna spoke out. �They�ll keep us here until you�re ready to do what they want.
And don�t talk about trying to get away, they�ll
punish us if you try to get away. They�ll punish us if we talk about trying to
get away.�

&nbsp;

The brunette span around as the cell door
opened and two guards entered. Without a word one wrenched her arms behind her
back and cuffed her wrists together. The other jammed a plug gag into her mouth
and strapped it tightly in place. �You know the rules, 201,� he said. �No
names.� She tried to kick out at him, earning a slap in the face for her
trouble. The man holding her arms pushed her down in a corner of the cell. He
walked across to Anna. �Thanks for the tip off, darling,� he said as the two of
them left the cell locking the girls in once more.

&nbsp;

Anna looked confused. Sally said, �How
could you? How could you?�

&nbsp;

�I didn�t. Really I didn�t,� Anna replied
as Sally moved away from her.

&nbsp;

The brunette grunted angrily into her gag. 

&nbsp;

�Did she?� I asked Brian.

&nbsp;

�No, I shouldn�t think so,� he replied.
�It�s just the sort of thing the guards will do to break them up and break
their spirit. They�ll have heard them talking on the monitors.� 

&nbsp;

�Shouldn�t they be a bit more docile than
that after orientation? I mean the others that I�ve seen are really
disorientated.�

&nbsp;

�Well, yes, they would be usually but if
we�re holding them until a specific buyer is available then we do some of the
orientation here. I�m not sure what�s gone on there but they�re probably due
for another week or so here. Maybe I�ll talk to the Prep Centre.�� 

&nbsp;

We moved on to another room. �I thought I�d
give you a buyer�s experience,� Brian said. �I�ve had a few girls put into the
display area where the buyers get to check out the lots before an auction and
then� we�ll have one of the girls brought
in for a pre-sale interview.. As far as she�s concerned you�re a potential new
owner. It�ll give you a chance to see how we set things up for customers. Are
you happy with that?�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, that sounds fine. I�m sure I can
project myself into the mind of one of your customers. Where�s the display
area?�

&nbsp;

Brian pointed to another featureless door.
�Through there,� he said. �Come on, I�ll show you.� He opened the door to a
brightly lit room.

&nbsp;

Along the left hand side of the room as we
entered were five diagonal crosses of wood on the facing wall were another
five, identical to the first except that four of these were each occupied by a
naked and shackled girl. With their hands cuffed above their heads, one to each
upper arm of the cross and their legs spread with their ankles cuffed to each
of the lower arms, they were completely exposed and accessible to the
prospective buyers. 

&nbsp;

Brian showed me each of the girls in turn.
�An interesting selection,� he said. �The results of a visit
by one of our teams to a shopping mall. We �borrowed� one of the dress
shops there that caters for young ladies like these. Dresses for those looking for something a little daring to go
clubbing in perhaps or to impress a prospective boyfriend. We made a few
adjustments to the arrangements of the changing rooms and we were able to
collect these delightful specimens. I think you�ll find them to your taste.�

&nbsp;

�Let�s see,� I said walking up to the first
and youngest looking girl. She looked terrified as I gripped her chin and
turned her head from side to side, examining her face. �Hmm, a bit of acne I
see.� 

&nbsp;

�Ah,� said Brian, �often a problem with
diet for girls of this age. You�ll find that will clear up with a normal
slave�s feeding regime.� 

&nbsp;

I took hold of a hank of her auburn hair.
�This feels a bit oily to me and the hair seems quite brittle.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, said Brian, again changing the
feeding regime will help that and of course she colours her hair. I�m sure
you�ll either be using better stylists than she could afford or returning her
to her natural colour or keeping her shaved. I don�t think that should be a
problem.�

&nbsp;

�Maybe not,� I said. I moved my hand back
to her face. �Eyes look clear enough though.�

&nbsp;

Brian looked at the number on the tag
attached to the girls collar and consulted the list on the clip board he as
holding. �Let�s see. Yes, perfect vision without glasses or contact lenses,
this one.�

&nbsp;

I let go of her chin and let my hands run
down to her breasts. They were pleasantly full, with perky nipples that
stiffened to the touch and wide dark areolas. �And these are real?� I asked,
bringing a whimper from the girl.

&nbsp;

�Quiet you!� Brian admonished. �Yes, not
enhanced as far as we can tell. It�s quite unusual to find much surgery done on
girls under twenty five.�

�� 

The next captive was less cooperative. She
hung her head sullenly as I approached her. �Look up,� barked Brian grabbing
her by the hair and jerking her head up.

&nbsp;

�Now this one is of eastern extraction. Indian or Paksistani?�

&nbsp;

�Bangladeshi,� said Brian consulting his
clipboard. �Parents originally from Rangpur but she�s
British, born and brought up in Birmingham. Just graduated from medical college.�

&nbsp;

�Bright girl then?�

&nbsp;

�Yes. We don�t routinely IQ test them but
it�s reckoned that a medical graduate typically has an IQ of 125.�

&nbsp;

I ran my hands across her breasts and down
across her belly to her crotch, she tried to avoid my touch, struggling against
the cuffs that held her spread-eagled on the cross, �Well that may actually be
a drawback for what I have in mind for whichever I purchase. Still she�s got
quite a nice taut body. Looks like she kept herself fit.
Maybe the athleticism compensates for the brain power.� The girl scowled at me
as we walked on to the next. �You said that you �borrowed� the shop. Can I take
it that you acquired the staff as well?�

&nbsp;

Brian smirked. �Yes indeed,� he said. �One
of the team �entertained� three of them in the stock room while three of our
girls ran the shop on their behalf. The staff were a
bit the worse for wear when we got them back � it was hard for our man to keep
his hands off them �cos they�d been stripped of their
uniforms for our girls. We drove them all off in the shop�s van at the end of
the day. We took the stock as well, cleaned the place out. These little shops
are closing down all the time. No one thinks too much about it.� 

�

The next girl was more an advert for fast
food outlets than health food shops. She had full breasts that certainly
wouldn�t pass the pencil test, a thick waist and heavy thighs. In spite of this
she returned my appraising looks with an earthy, sexual gaze. She writhed
appreciatively as I pinched and squeezed at her nipples. �This one,� I said,
�might be useful. What�s her background?�

&nbsp;

�Bit of a young entrepreneur, that one.
Started up her own business with a network of office
cleaners.�

&nbsp;

�Excellent, excellent,� I said. She looked
hopeful. �I need someone to keep the place clean, and this one will look good
corseted into a maid�s uniform. She won�t need much training in what�s
required, will she?�

&nbsp;

�Bastard!� the girl exclaimed pulling
against the straps that stretched her out on the wooden cross. �I�m no skivvy!�

&nbsp;

�You�re told not to talk to the buyers,�
Brian barked slapping her face.

&nbsp;

�That�s all right,� I said, warming to my
part. �A little spirit goes a long way. I find it�s easier to break the
competent to my will than to teach the incompetent. She�ll see sense, I�m
sure.�

&nbsp;

She growled but said nothing. The next girl
was more distressed than angry. She tried to keep still as I ran my hands testingly over her body but it was evident that she was having to try hard to suppress a reaction.

&nbsp;

�This one is more docile,� Brian advised.
�The marks from her beatings have more or less healed. She needed rather more
encouragement than is usual.� I could see that there were still raised lines on
the inside of her thighs but she did not try to pull away as I touched the
bruised area.

&nbsp;

�Hmm,� I said seemingly uninterested. �I�m
not so keen on these shorter girls. I suppose she good be used for breeding
stock. What do you think?�

&nbsp;

�She not been pregnant that we know of,�
Brian said, �but she�s fertile enough. Her periods have been disrupted since
she came here, but that�s not uncommon. She could be useful if you�re looking
to breed.�

&nbsp;

�Well, thank you,� I said. �I�ve seen
enough for now.� Brian smiled and showed me out. �That was useful. Who decided
to do the shop raid? Actually, who chooses the targets generally? I mean, how
do you decide which girls to pick up? 

&nbsp;

�Ah, good question,� said Brian, �I hadn�t
thought about it all that much, I just do the selling. I guess it�s the snatch
squads. Sometimes Freddie comes up with an idea but mainly it�s the squads
themselves, I think���� That seemed a bit odd to me but I let it pass. We went
into another room. �We�ve set up a face to face sales interview here,� Brian
explained. �The sort of thing all the girls have to do if there�s a client that
seems particularly interested after seeing them in the display hall. The girl
we�ve chosen is due to start sales interviews this week so she should be as
ready as they usually are.�

&nbsp;

�Bring her in,� I said, �let�s see how she
acquits herself.�

&nbsp;

A young woman, about twenty five years old
was brought in by one of the guards, led by a leash from her collar. She was
dressed in a simple black dress with long sleeves and a skirt that stretched to
just above her knees. She was carrying a small back case in hands that were
cuffed in front of her. Her hair was dark and wavy; long, it hung to below her
shoulders. Her skin was pale, dark eyebrows, dark eyes, and full red lips
stretched around the ball that gagged her. I looked at her body. Her dress
wasn�t doing her any favours but it looked as if she might have a reasonable
figure underneath it. She was wearing black tights or stockings and high heels.
Her legs looked OK.

&nbsp;

Brian put a file on the table in front of
me. �This is 05/179,� he said. �I think you�ll find she has the profile you�re
looking for.�

&nbsp;

�Hmm,� I said getting to my feet. �I�m not
so sure.� The girl looked concerned as I approached her. �It�s hard to tell if
she�s got much of a body.� I took the case from her and put it on the desk. I
lifted her skirt. She was wearing stockings. She had no pants on. I had a good
view of her neatly trimmed bush. I dropped her skirt. The girl looked relieved.
I sat down and looked across at Brian. �So what�s the sales pitch for this
one?� I asked.

&nbsp;

�She can do that herself,� said Brian
getting up and loosening off the girl�s gag. 

&nbsp;

She shook her head as the ball came free of
her mouth. �Thank you, Sir,� she said, automatically.

&nbsp;

�See,� said Brian, �she�s had her initial
orientation training. You�ll find her appropriately respectful. Stand up
straight girl and answer the questions.�

&nbsp;

I turned to the girl. �Well, you�d better
tell me about yourself, if you�re looking for a new owner as I hear.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Sir,� the girl replied. �I�m number
05/179, I�m 24 years old, British born. I speak French
and Italian as well and English. I have a degree in music and I was most
recently a clarinettist in a classical wind quintet.�

&nbsp;

�Sexual experience?� The girl blushed. �I mean before you came here, I imagine you�ve
had plenty during your orientation; that doesn�t count.�

&nbsp;

�I�ve had two lovers, Sir. One shortly
after I went to university and the other a year ago. I don�t really consider
myself sexually experienced but I am sure that I can be trained to be a good
slave in that way.�

&nbsp;

�Men or women?�

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry, Sir?�

&nbsp;

�Your lovers. Were they men or women?�

&nbsp;

�Oh, I see, men Sir, both of them. I�ve
never, well, been, with a woman. Not even here. But, Sir if that was what you
required of course I would��

&nbsp;

I cut her off, �Yes, of course you would. I
was interested in actual experiences however.� 

� 

She looked abashed and hung her head. �No,
Sir,� she said.

&nbsp;

�Never mind. That needn�t be a problem. You play clarinet?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Sir. That�s my instrument,� she pointed to the case on the desk. �I
could play for you if you like. If my hands can be freed.�
She held her hands out towards me.

&nbsp;

�I would like that, girl,� I said. Brian
got up and unlocked the girl�s cuffs. She moved to pick up the clarinet. �Take
off your dress first.� 

&nbsp;

She looked shocked but composed herself
quickly. She reached behind her back and unzipped the dress. She shrugged it
from her shoulders and it felt to the floor about her ankles. 

&nbsp;

�And the bra,� I said. She unclipped the
front fastening of her bra and pulled it off. She stepped out of her dress and
put it and the bra on a chair beside the desk. �Not too bad,� I said, giving
her an appraising look. �All right, get on with it.�

&nbsp;

She reached for the pieces of the clarinet
and put them together. She took a reed from the case and wetted it between her
lips before fitting it in place. She put the mouthpiece between her lips and
sucked at it.

&nbsp;

�That�s a useful skill apart from her
music,� Brian prompted. �Show us!� The girl gave a frightened look but then
started to suck and lick at the clarinet as if it were a man�s cock. She
reached down with the clarinet and pushed it into her cunt
before returning it to her mouth and repeating her lascivious performance.

&nbsp;

�Now, that I like,� I said. �And you
thought I couldn�t appreciate skilled musicianship.� All right, enough of that, let�s hear you
play.�

&nbsp;

She started with the wailing opening of
Gershwin�s Rhapsody in Blue. It was almost enough to make me leap the desk and
fuck her there and then. I restrained myself, sitting quietly, absorbing the
music. She was lost in concentration, appeared to have forgotten that all she
was wearing was a pair of shoes, stockings and a leather collar. She moved on
to a classical piece. I�m no expert but it could have been Mozart. Then back to
jazz, with a couple of Sidney Bechet tracks. I was
enjoying it, which wasn�t really the point. I waved her to stop. �OK,� I said,
�that�ll do.�

&nbsp;

She stood quietly, licking her lips,
breathing slowly. �Should I put my cuffs back on?� she asked. I nodded, she put her clarinet back in the case and locked the
cuffs back around her wrists

&nbsp;

�All right, tell me how you come to be
here.�

&nbsp;

She looked across questioningly at Brian.
He nodded.

&nbsp;

�Err, I was kidnapped, Sir.� She said, in a
husky tone.

&nbsp;

�I imagined so, girl. I hardly thought you
had put yourself up for sale. Tell me how.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, I see. But�
Oh, I hate to remember it.� She put her hands to her face.

&nbsp;

�Listen young lady,� I said sternly, �your
life became your owner�s property from that point on. You�ll tell me willingly
or you�ll suffer for it.�

&nbsp;

�No, please. I don�t want to be hurt any
more. I�ll tell you. Listen. I got an email. It was from the leader of our
quintet. Or I thought it was. It asked me to go to a new rehearsal room that
evening. We were preparing for a concert. This was somewhere I hadn�t been
before. The street was dark. There were two other musicians standing outside
the hall, a man and a woman in a cape. I didn�t recognise them. We stood around
waiting for the hall to open. A car pulled into the road, drove up and stopped
alongside us. And�� She faltered.

&nbsp;

�Go on,� I urged, �continue.�

&nbsp;

The girl swallowed. �The woman took off her
cloak and threw it over my head. They pushed me into the car and drove off. It
was all so quick, I didn�t have a chance too cry out or anything. They tied me
up and pushed me down on the floor of the car and just drove away. They put
something in my mouth and taped it shut. I couldn�t cry out. It happened in
moments. One minute I was waiting to play, the next I was on my way here.�

&nbsp;

�And then? Your training.
Have you been trained?�

&nbsp;

�Well, Sir, I know I am only starting to
learn. I know that I have to do all I am told by my owner. I think you will
find me obedient and willing to please.�

�

�Hmm, perhaps. Turn around again for me. Put your hands on your head, I want a
clear view.�

&nbsp;

She did as I asked, still evidently
embarrassed by her virtual nakedness.

&nbsp;

I turned to Brian. �I�m not sure that she�s
really what I�m looking for,� I said.

&nbsp;

She fell to her knees as I got up to leave,
grabbing out at my ankles. �Oh, please,� she said, �please, you must buy me.
I�ll be punished if they think I haven�t done a good enough job of selling myself,
please you must understand. I cannot stay here.� 

&nbsp;

I looked down at the naked musician
sprawled at my feet. �You�ll need a more convincing reason than that, girl. No
one is going to take you on just because you want to leave here. They�ll buy
you if they think that you�re the most useful for them. Now let go. You�ll be
taken back to your cell.�

&nbsp;

Brian and I left the room with the girl
still on the floor sobbing. We looked back in through the one-way glass panel
as a guard appeared to return her. He jammed the gag back into her mouth and
hauled her to her feet before ordering her to pick up her clarinet case and
clothes. He clipped her leash to her collar and hauled her back out of the
room.

&nbsp;

�How was that,� said Brian.

&nbsp;

�Interesting,� I said.

&nbsp;

�You should come in and do that for all the
girls,� Brian said. �They could do with a practice run through before meeting
real customers.�

&nbsp;

�It would be worth doing,� I said, �but I�m
going to be busy. Why don�t you get some of your own team to do it?�

&nbsp;

�Yeah,� said Brian. �Yeah, maybe I will.� I
was unconvinced.

&nbsp;

It was then I bumped into Harry. �You doing
anything tomorrow morning?� he said.

&nbsp;

�No,� I said, �nothing special. Why?�

�

�Let�s just say I�m embarrassed about your
last little try out on operations. I thought you could use some practice.�

&nbsp;

�I dunno Harry. I
don�t want to cause any more problems.�

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry about it. We all had to start
somewhere. I�m taking another snatch trainee out. It may even be useful just
for you to watch.�

&nbsp;

�OK,� I said warily. I guessed I needed to
see more of that side of things.

&nbsp;

�Great,� said Harry, tossing me a small
back pack. �Get yourself familiar with the contents of this goody bag and meet
us in the parking area at 8 o�clock. There�s
some coveralls in the bag. Better have those on too.�

&nbsp;

Chapter 8: Practice Makes Perfect

&nbsp;

I fetched up in the car park just before 8 o�clock. The white van that we�d used to pick up Jackie from the petrol
station was parked with its engine running. Harry leant out of the driver�s
window. �Come on,� he said, �get in. I�ll brief you on the way.�

&nbsp;

I jogged around to the far side of the van
and slid back the door. 

&nbsp;

�Hi,� said a girl�s voice as I went to
climb in. Sitting next to Harry was a girl in her early twenties with short
blonde hair. She and Harry were wearing the same coveralls that I�d put on. 

&nbsp;

�Hi,� I said in response, not sure if names
were in order.

&nbsp;

Harry cleared up the doubts. �This is
Tricia,� he said, she�s a trainee for the snatch squads. �Tricia, this is
Larry.�

&nbsp;

Tricia smiled as the van pulled away. �This
your first live one too?� she asked as she buckled her seat belt. Pulling the
diagonal strap tight down between her tits showed that the coveralls were
certainly camouflaging something worthwhile underneath.� 

&nbsp;

�No,� I said, �not quite, but I�m pretty
much a beginner.�

&nbsp;

�OK,� said Harry, as we drove down the
motorway, �listen up. This is a training exercise so we don�t bring anyone
back, all right.� Tricia and I both nodded simultaneously. �There�s a big house
we�re going to. There should be two ladies there according to our friends in
Research. We bust in, make like it�s a burglary and you two get some practice
in grab and secure. OK?�

&nbsp;

�Sure, Harry,� I said. 

&nbsp;

�Yeah,� said Tricia.

&nbsp;

�Right. Well since we will be leaving the ladies we meet behind we�ll do
this in masks, which you should have in your bags. So get those ready and get
your gloves on. We�re nearly there.�

&nbsp;

The van off the motorway
and along a road towards a nearby small town. We
turned left into a leafy avenue of large houses, each set back from the road
with fifty yards or so of driveway leading up to them.� Some had big security gates. We stopped on
one side of the road just as a pair of gates opened on the other side. There
wasn�t anyone else about, no other traffic and it didn�t look like the sort of
district where anyone would walk if they were going further than their
neighbours. A Porsche Cayenne pulled out of the gates and drove off, a young,
blonde woman in sunglasses at the wheel. She didn�t bother to close the gates.
�There she goes,� said Harry. �She�s away to drop the kiddies off at playgroup.
Now here�s the deal. We wait five minutes. Drive in and park around the back.
You two are going to do all the work, I�m just along for the ride and to make
sure no one drops any bricks. �He grinned at me. �They�ve had tradesmen in and
out all last week so no one will be bothered about us. There�ll be a girl
inside cleaning house. Tricia, you�ll go in; grab and secure the hired help.
We�ll follow. Yummy Mummy will be back after fifteen minutes so Tricia, you�ll
need to be slick with the help. Harry, you can do the same for Mummy when she
turns up. Clear?�

&nbsp;

�Clear enough, I guess,� I said not
entirely confident after the debacle with Amanda.

&nbsp;

�Fine,� said Tricia.

&nbsp;

�OK. Now this is a nice quiet neighbourhood
and we want to come back. So we make sure our guests don�t make too much fuss
and don�t get hurt any more than is needed for you two to get your practice.
Like I said, it�s to look like a burglary; so if you want to pocket stuff, feel
free. If you want to scare them, then fair enough; specially
if it help with your grab. Just don�t do anything that would
get the police more interested in us than necessary. OK, check the
contents of your bags and remember to check that you bring it all back apart
from the consumables.�

&nbsp;

Tricia called out, �Ski mask, pair latex
gloves, dozen cable ties, one roll duct tape, multi-function tool, knife.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, same for me,� I said.

&nbsp;

�OK,� said Harry, �gloves on now, masks on
as soon as we are round the back. Here we go.� He pulled out across the road
and up the drive. �Pleasant Pastures� the sign said on the gate. Gravel
crunched under the van�s tyres as we pulled in behind the house. I let Tricia
climb over me to get out. She trotted over to the back door of the house. The
back door was open. She slipped inside. A few moments later she reappeared at
the back door and waved us in. We got out of the van and joined her. �Any
problems?� said Harry.

&nbsp;

�See for yourself,� said Tricia pointing
into the kitchen. 

&nbsp;

We went through. The hired help wouldn�t be
doing any more cleaning up for a while. Tricia had her well and truly helpless
on the floor, cable ties around her wrists and ankles, another one linking her
wrists and ankles in a tight hogtie, tape across her mouth. Struggling in her
tee-shirt and jeans, I reckoned she wasn�t even as old as Jacqui, the girl I�d
helped Harry pick up at the petrol station. She squealed in fright as she saw
there were three of us. �OK,� said Harry, �neat enough.� 

&nbsp;

We heard the sound of a car pulling up
outside the front. �That will be the lady of the house,� said Harry. The help
started squealing some more. Tricia pulled a kitchen knife from a wood block
beside the cooker and held it against the girl�s throat. She quietened down a
whole lot and paid the knife a lot of attention. Harry gestured towards the
pantry and Tricia grabbed the girl under her arms and dragged her off there. We
heard the front door open. Harry gave me a thumbs up
and followed Tricia into the pantry. I was on my own.

&nbsp;

I stepped behind the kitchen door. It was
standing ajar. �Natalie,� I heard a woman�s voice call out. �Natalie. I�m back.
Natalie. Where are you?� The sound of her voice was getting closer. I guessed
she would come through into the kitchen searching. The door started to move, I
swallowed and got ready to spring.

&nbsp;

Before I could, the phone rang. The kitchen
door was pulled shut from the other side and I heard the tap of heels on a
wooden floor receding down the hall. I waited, uncertain if I should try to
follow or stay put and wait. I decided to wait. There was no rush and no point
in trying to snatch her in the middle of a phone call, either.

&nbsp;

The phone call only took a few moments.
�Natalie, Natalie,� called the voice again. There was a squeak followed by a
muffled grunt from the pantry. I guessed that Tricia had given her a thump. The
door to the kitchen opened this time. �Natalie?� I took my chance and grabbed
Yummy Mummy as she got through the door. One arm around her waist to trap her
arms one over her mouth to silence any cries. Her silk shirt was cool and
slippery. The grab seemed to work. I kicked the door shut behind us. �Keep
quiet, bitch or you�ll really get hurt,� I hissed in her ear. She was
struggling but it was nothing I couldn�t handle, she was quite small and
lightly built and she�d obviously never learned any self defence techniques.
Neither did she have a bottle of vodka in her hands. �Now do as you�re told and
it�ll be a whole lot easier. Keep quiet and I�ll take my hand off your mouth, make
a sound and I�ll slice your tongue off. OK?�

&nbsp;

She gave a grunt that I took as agreement.
I eased my hand away and she didn�t make a sound. 

&nbsp;

�Down on the floor hands behind your back,�
I ordered, gripping her at the back of her neck. I pushed her to the floor,
grabbed her wrists and put a cable tie tightly around them. I did the same for
her ankles. Good legs, I thought as I pulled the strip of plastic into place.
She gasped as I jerked the ties tight.

&nbsp;

I took another knife from the block. She
looked terrified. �No, please,� she said. I cut a strip from my roll of tape
and strapped it across her mouth. She gave a resigned �mmph�.
I sat her up, pleased with my work:- one cute lady,
very neat in her Herm�s
silk shirt and short black skirt, snatched, bound and gagged and no fowl ups
this time.

&nbsp;

My satisfaction didn�t last long. �Louise!�
another voice was calling from the hall. The woman I was holding looked even
more scared. �It�s Jenny,� the voice called, �I came straight over. Much better than talking on the phone. Hope that coffee is
ready. Louise?� The kitchen door swung open again. The owner of the voice
appeared. �Oh, no,� she cried as she saw me crouched over the helpless Louise,
knife in hand. 

&nbsp;

�Come and join us,� I barked holding the
knife against Louise�s throat. �Nice and slowly or your friend Louise here is
really going to get hurt.� Louise whimpered into her gag. The neighbour gave a
swallowed cry of fright.

&nbsp;

She had obviously read all the right books.
She put her hands up. �Please don�t hurt us. I�ll do as you say.�

&nbsp;

�On the floor! Face down!� I ordered. �Hands behind you!�
She was as good as gold. I had enough cable ties and tape to deal with her as
well and she was soon no more of a threat than Louise. I rolled her over and
took a look at the pair of them, Louise; early twenties I guessed, blonde,
slim; Jenny; older, mid thirties maybe and already using botox
if the fixed expression on her face was anything to go by, though I guess that
could have been terror. Tricia emerged from the pantry, jogged passed me and
out into the hall. Harry pulled the other girl out to join my two. The three of
them were evidently all distressed to see the others.

&nbsp;

Tricia returned. �The front door�s shut
now,� she said. �We shouldn�t get anyone else coming to join us.�

&nbsp;

�Good,� said Harry, �I hate uninvited
guests�. He turned to the bound and gagged women and checked the cable ties and
tape that held them helpless. �You three ladies stay here, we�ll see what we
can find and then we�ll be off. OK?� A series of grunts greeted his question.
It was hard to tell what they meant. I guessed it wasn�t, �Sure, why not and
while you�re about it would you like some coffee?� Harry led the way out into
the hall.

&nbsp;

�Not bad,� he said when we had all
assembled. He turned to Tricia, �You were pretty slick, and dealt with the help
quickly and cleanly.� He turned back to me, �And you did a good job too,
especially with the other woman turning up. You did the right thing when the
phone rang and you could have panicked when her friend arrived but you didn�t.
Have a look around and see what you can find, nothing too bulky. Make as much
mess as you like but nothing that�ll be seen from outside. Take about ten
minutes and meet back here.� 

&nbsp;

We spread out. I found the study and turned
out the desk, contents of the drawers all over the floor. There was a bit of
cash but not much. I went back to the hall. Tricia came down the stairs shortly
after. Harry appeared. �OK,� he said. �What now?�

&nbsp;

�We put our friends somewhere that they can
spend the rest of the morning without being disturbed,� said Trish.

&nbsp;

�Sounds good to me,� said Harry. �Did you
find anywhere upstairs?

&nbsp;

�Yes, the main bedroom looks out over the
back and there are some chairs in the corridor up there too.�

&nbsp;

�And what about making sure they stay
there?�

&nbsp;

�We�ll need some rope or something,� I
volunteered. �I know, there�s plenty of wire on the
electrical appliances around the place. We can use that.�

&nbsp;

�Fine,� said Harry, looking approving.
�Better get on with it.��� 

&nbsp;

We went back into the kitchen. The three
girls were still sprawled out on the floor but they had obviously been trying
to get loose, Jenny had her hands pulling at the cable tie on Louise�s wrists,
Natalie was trying to rub her gag loose on the corner of a cupboard. �Naughty,
naughty,� Harry said as they looked around guiltily. �Right, you�re coming
upstairs.�

&nbsp;

The girls gave out with whimperings
of alarm, interpreting this as a prelude to rape. Harry took a knife and sliced
through the cable ties that held their ankles. He pulled Natalie to her feet
and prodded the knife against her ribs. �You other two get up.� I grabbed Jenny
and pushed her towards the stairs. Tricia did the same with Louise. The women
stumbled up the stairs, grunting with complaint all the time, with us half
dragging, half pushing them. Tricia led the way to the main bedroom. She had
really turned it over. Clothes were strewn everywhere, jewellery boxes were
upturned their contents scattered. Harry brought a couple of straight back
chairs in from the corridor. There was one in the bedroom already next to the
dressing table. We lined them up in the middle of the room.

&nbsp;

Jenny went on the first one, I still had
some spare cable ties, I looped one around each of each of her arms above the
elbow and used them to tie her to the chair back, There
was plenty of tape left and I used that to strap each ankle to one of the front
legs of the chair. I cut the power cord from a hair dryer and pulled that
around her waist tying her to the chair as well. Another couple of lengths of
tape went around her thighs just above her knees and fixed her legs to the top
of the legs of the chair, spreading her thighs nicely and giving us a good view
up her short skirt. Harry, still holding on to a terrified Louise, looked on
with approval. Tricia took care of Natalie. The cable from the vacuum cleaner
that the help had been using served to tie Natalie to her chair, with lengths
around her chest and arms and across her lap.

&nbsp;

Harry spun Louise around. �Did you guys
find much money?� he asked. Tricia and I both shook our heads.

&nbsp;

�No,� said Tricia, �not even any good
jewellery.�

&nbsp;

�Disappointing,� Harry said to a wriggling
Louise, �Maybe you and I should try out the bed to make up for my trouble.� Her
gagged squeals and struggles made it clear that she didn�t think much of the
idea. Harry relented and pushed her across to Tricia, who tied her to the third
chair with the same thoroughness she had used on Natalie.� 

&nbsp;

�We�d better gag them properly, if we�re
leaving them here,� said Tricia. �Get some scarves and socks or anything like
that. I rummaged around in the pile of discarded clothing and found some likely
looking candidates including some expensive looking silk ties. Tricia pulled
back the tape from each girl�s mouth in turn, wadded socks or panties between
their lips, tied a scarf or tie across it and then
applied two new strips of tape in criss-cross fashion. Natalie made the most
fuss, begging not to be gagged as soon as the tape came off. Tricia showed her
no mercy and pushed a pair of sports socks into the girl�s mouth before adding
the tape. The three of them sat shaking their heads, their cheeks puffed out by
the wads of cloth that packed their mouths. Between them they weren�t going to
make enough noise to be heard from any distance.

&nbsp;

While Tricia was doing this I noticed a
necklace that Louise was wearing. I pulled her blouse open to get a better look
at it.� �Here,� I said. �At least there�s
some jewellery here.� I pulled it from her neck and took off the earrings she
was wearing too.� I checked her hands �
some nice rings. She was struggling in her chair as I pulled those from her
fingers and making quite a fuss into her gag as well.� Jenny and Natalie got the same
treatment.� We blindfolded them and just
to get them really worried Harry and I had a good grope at each if them while
Tricia packed up the things we were taking. Jenny had some pretty pricey
underwear on once I got her dress pushed up; I used my knife to cut her dress
open to get a better look. I sliced through her bra between the cups. She
squealed in fright as her tits were exposed. I gave her nipples a friendly
pinch.

&nbsp;

We left the girls struggling in the
shambles that was Louise�s bedroom, a right bunch of desperate housewives. They
were going to make a right sight for whoever discovered them

&nbsp;

I watched from the bedroom door when they
thought we had gone. The level of �mmmphing� went up
noticeably and the three of them were all trying to move back or forward, side
to side, in attempts to loosen off their ties. They weren�t having any success
but it did make their tits bounce around agreeably. Natalie was shaking her
chair up and down, if she wasn�t careful she have the
whole thing over and it wasn�t like there was anyone to hear the noise. Louise
was working hard to free herself too. Her skirt had ridden up where Tricia had
tied her on to the chair and I had a good view of her legs. Jenny�s efforts
just meant she was starting to fall out of her dress completely. I was
beginning to enjoy this side of the job.

&nbsp;

We figured that Louise wouldn�t be missed
until that afternoon when she failed to turn up to pick up the kiddies, Natalie
was probably expected to be there all morning and it wouldn�t be until hubby
came back for Jenny. Either way, that gave us plenty of time to get clear. We
were back in the van, masks off, and on our way in minutes.

&nbsp;

�Not a bad job at all,� said Harry as we
got back to the motorway. �Tricia, that was a fine first run and Larry, you
seem to have worked out how to do this stuff now.�

&nbsp;

�Gee, thanks,� said Tricia. �Oh, I get it,�
she said looking at me with a smile, �you�re the
marketing guy aren�t you? That�s pretty cool � I don�t expect to see the suits
down in operations.�

&nbsp;

�Thanks,� I said. �Even the suits need to
get their hands dirty occasionally.�

&nbsp;

Tricia giggled and smiled again. This could
be interesting I thought. Then she laughed, �Hey, I�ve just realised � �When
Harry met Larry�!�

&nbsp;

�We�ve heard it,� I grimaced as the van
turned out of the estate and back onto the ring road but I was feeling pretty
pleased with myself. Harry didn�t say anything else. I
took that as a complement.

&nbsp;

I took a call from Freddie later that
afternoon. �How was the Sales Centre?� He didn�t wait for an answer. �Good,
good. Anyway, you said you wanted to chat to some of my customers,� he said.

&nbsp;

�If that�s possible, I replied, �I can
understand why they might be reticent.�

&nbsp;

�No, no problem. Anyway it�s all fixed.
Steve Glennis. Has a place in the Leeward Islands. Bought from us plenty of times in the past. Got quite an eye
for a filly, they say, He�ll be the chap for you. Get yourself out to Barbados.
He�ll pick you up from there.

Chapter 9: Island Girl

&nbsp;

�It�s very good of you to see me, Mr
Glennis,� I smiled extending my hand to the tall, distinguished looking grey
haired man was welcoming me into his island home. As we walked down the pier, towards
a path that led away from the palm trimmed beach, two heavily set men passed us.
They headed towards the seaplane that I had just left; no doubt to collect the
�cargo� that I had shared my flight with. 

&nbsp;

�It�s my pleasure, believe me. And it�s
Steve, please. I�ve had the benefit of Clegg�s services down the years and I�m
happy to do him a favour. I hope you didn�t mind coming out with my latest
shipment.�� 

&nbsp;

�No, not at all,� I replied. �She was
pretty quiet. No trouble to anyone.�

&nbsp;

The two men came back along the jetty. One
had the helpless, blindfolded and gagged girl that had been strapped into the
Beaver�s back seat, tossed across his shoulder. �Excuse us, Sir,� he said.

&nbsp;

My host waved them through, �Of course.
Carry on,� he said before turning to me again. �You�re new to this line of work
he tells me.�

&nbsp;

�Err, yes, it�s a sort of career change for
me,� I replied

&nbsp;

�That�s OK. It�s not the sort of job you�d
necessarily go to straight from college. Plenty of people in this business
start at your sort of age. Now how can I help?�

&nbsp;

�Well, I�m trying to understand a bit more
about Clegg�s customers. What their needs are; why they do business with us.
That sort of thing.�

&nbsp;

�Fine. Well I guess we�ll take a bit of
time, let you see how I put Mr Clegg�s products to use and so on.�

&nbsp;

�Fine by me. Where do we start?�

&nbsp;

�Oh, right here I think. Do you fancy a
drink?�

&nbsp;

I certainly did. It was pretty hot and,
although the deck was shaded, the white sands in front of the villa seemed to
be throwing heat at the building. I was happy to accept his offer. He pressed a
button on the wall beside the couch. Moments later a slight, Chinese girl
appeared, her slim figure modestly covered by a one-piece bathing costume.
�Hi,� she said. �Can I get you guys something?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, please Sukie,� my host replied. He
turned to me �Beer OK?� he asked.

&nbsp;

�Sure,� I replied.

&nbsp;

�Better make that two, please,� he said to
Sukie who smiled again and disappeared. As she did so he turned to me sensing
my confusion. �You�re wondering if she�s one of my slaves or something else,�
he said. �Well, just because I want them to stay doesn�t mean they all have to
be kept in chains, you know. It�s not such a bad place after all and anywhere
else is a real long swim from here, unless she was to try to stow away on the
seaplane or the supply boat.� Sukie reappeared carrying two bottles of chilled
beer on a tray. �Tell Larry how you came to be here,� he said to her.

&nbsp;

Sukie smiled shyly and sat at our feet.
�It�s not such an interesting story,� she said. �I�m from L.A. originally. I
was working there in a jewellery store. A guy came into the store one day and
asked me to serve him. He wanted to buy a bracelet. It was rather nice - gold
set with rubies. He had me model it for him. Said I should always wear
bracelets because I had such slim wrists. Said he wanted it for someone
special.�

&nbsp;

�And then what happened?�

&nbsp;

�He paid for it and left.� She giggled and
played with her hair. �Oh, you want all the gory details. You men are all the
same. Well, Steve obviously has some friends who are very good at helping him
get the things he wants. And one of the things he wanted was me. Maybe two days
later, a uniformed chauffeur arrives at the door of my apartment. I mean can
you imagine! He gives me a small box. Inside it is the bracelet and a note on
headed paper from a down town restaurant, �Have dinner with me?� it said. 

&nbsp;

I just thought it was so romantic. I
followed the chauffeur down to the road and out front was this enormous limo �
you know the sort of thing; stretches two blocks, blacked out windows, bright
chrome. As we drove off I thought, is this wise? I�ve no idea who this man is,
really. I was thinking if this driver takes one wrong turn then, I�ll be on my
mobile faster than he can think. But it�s fine. He drove me to the restaurant.
I felt like royalty. When I arrived they took my coat, showed me to a table. 

&nbsp;

�Then they said there was a phone call. I
went to a booth and picked up the phone. There was a quiet hiss and I woke up
with a headache, bouncing around inside a wooden crate with cuffs on my wrists
and ankles and a ball strapped into my mouth. I guess that bit wasn�t so
romantic.�

&nbsp;

Steve smiled. �My friends have ways they
find hard to change,� he said with a shrug of his shoulders. 

&nbsp;

�Anyway the crate was in a truck. It�s transferred
to a �plane. It ended up here. Steve makes it plain that he wants me to stay.
So I do. Of course I know if I tried to leave he�d kill me. But it�s nice
here.� She gave a half smile that lacked any sincerity. �Now if you�ll excuse
me.�

&nbsp;

�Sure, Sukie,� said Steve. �Run along.� I
watched her neat backside as she walked back into the house. Steve looked at
me. �Do you want to try her?� he asked.

&nbsp;

�But isn�t she, well, I thought��

&nbsp;

�She�s only one of the girls here. She does
what I want her to and that includes looking after you if I like it. Just
because I don�t keep her with chains on doesn�t mean I don�t own her. Do you
want to try her? I meant it. Freddie said to look after you. Said you�d just
split up with your girl or something.�

&nbsp;

It seemed impolite to refuse the offer and
it had been a while. �Something like that,� I said, � Yeah, that would be
great.�

&nbsp;

It was after dinner when she came to my
room. It was hot. I was laying on my bed, the ceiling fan spinning slowly
above. She�d let down her long, straight, jet black hair. It almost reached the
hem of a skirt that came barely below her hips. Her hands were behind her back;
I guessed they were strapped or chained there. She wore a ball gag like a
necklace, the ball at her throat. She smiled, still without warmth and then looked
down at the floor. �Steve said I should be nice to you,� she said.

&nbsp;

�Did you need to be bound?� I asked.

&nbsp;

I was lying on the bed, naked. She climbed
up alongside me. �Steve thought you might like it. You can use the gag on me
too, if you want.�

&nbsp;

She seemed to combine a direct sensuality
with a strange vulnerability. �Would that be a good idea?� I said.

&nbsp;

�Only if you�re planning to hurt me,� she
said, �and then only if you don�t want to hear the results. Otherwise you might
like it better not to.� She wriggled closer to me and then knelt astride my
belly. She smiled again as she gripped the zip of my trousers with her hands
behind her back. With practiced ease and still smiling directly at me, she
reached back and pulled my steadily growing cock from my pants. I felt the edge
of her finger nails on its underside as she stroked and teased it. �Did you
like hearing about my abduction?� she asked. �My talking of it seemed to excite
you.�

&nbsp;

�I, ahh, guess so,� I replied, responding
to a firmer caress. �Uh � huh, it�s new to me and I, mmm � that�s good, I need
to learn.�

&nbsp;

�I had to learn too,� she said, continuing
to squeeze and stroke at my cock behind her back. �but that was different. They
took great care of me. They took me from the crate and made sure I wasn�t hurt.
They took off the gag and gave me water. They even took the cuffs off my wrists
and my ankles. That�s when they raped me the first time. Told me to strip and
then raped me. Three of them, one after the other. Said I�d need to get used to
it. They were right of course. Then they came back for my mouth. Then they came
back for my arse.�

&nbsp;

I could see she was distressed by the
memory. �You don�t have to tell me any more,� I said.

&nbsp;

�Yes, I do,� she said, flatly, lowering her
eyes. �Steve said that I should.�

&nbsp;

�And what if use this,� I sat up and
reached for the gag. For the first time her smile seemed genuinely warm. 

&nbsp;

�Then I would have to let you.� She parted
her lips as I pushed the ball in and strapped it in place. With the gag filling
her mouth she whimpered and nodded her head in gratitude, freed of the need to
tell me of her trials. I reached up to touch her breast, she relaxed as she
realised I didn�t intend to pinch her. She eased herself backwards until her
cunt slipped over my cock. She seemed to lose herself as she slid up and down
on my member. First, the hunted, frightened look faded from her face and then
she closed her eyes as the rhythmic sensations took hold of her.� 

&nbsp;

Afterwards she lay beside me on the bed,
her wrists still chained behind her, the gag still in place. I had made a move
to remove it but her wide eyed, pleading look had stopped me. In response she
had nuzzled against me and moaned softly as I toyed with her nipples. 

&nbsp;

Somewhere far off in the house I heard a
clock start to chime midnight. Sukie sat up suddenly in reaction to the sound. She knelt on the
bed beside me and gave a bow of her head. She got to her feet and left without
looking back. Somehow I felt more lonely then than before she had come to my
room.

&nbsp;

The following morning I joined my host for
breakfast. Sukie was there, smiling as she served us.

&nbsp;

�Did you two have fun?� said Steve as Sukie
poured orange juice into two glasses. I scooped pieces of mango into a bowl.

&nbsp;

�Yeah,� I said. �Sukie was very sweet.
Thank you.�

&nbsp;

�Don�t mention it,� said Steve. �That�s
what you�re for isn�t it, Sukie dear?�

&nbsp;

Sukie bowed her head. �Yes, Sir,� she said.

&nbsp;

�Good girl,� said Steve. �Run along.�

&nbsp;

I took a drink of my juice as I watched her
leave. �That�s quite a story of hers. Did Freddie pick her up for you?� 

&nbsp;

�No, that wasn�t one of his. I guess I
don�t think of Freddie for that sort of specific pick up. I mean his auctions
are good if I can get over there � like I did for the girl that came out with
you. He�s always a good man to call if you�re looking for something in stock. I
had a couple of house slaves from one of his auctions last year, but when I
need something specific picked up there�s some folk I use over in the States.
Here let me show you who I used for Sukie.�

&nbsp;

He pulled out a laptop from beside the
table and fired it up. He opened a web browser and I found myself looking at a
web-site, �Chicks In Chains�. He typed in a membership ID and password.

&nbsp;

�Bondage porn?� I said.

&nbsp;

�It looks like it, doesn�t it,� he said.
�The only thing is that all these bound and gagged young ladies in this part of
the membership area aren�t actually willing participants in the site. They�re
all this guy�s stock. You can check out what�s there at any time and put in a
bid if there�s anything you fancy. Plus there�s a part of the site� Oh, where
is it� Oh, yes, here.� Part of the site
where you can check out what the girls are good at, there�s a lot of feed-back
on what they can and can�t do. It�s all pretty easy. See.����� 

� 

I watched the tour of the site with
interest. �Have you got any more pick-ups planned?� I asked.

&nbsp;

�Yes, sure. A couple. I�m planning to
replace Sukie as a house slave soon. Oh, don�t mention that � I don�t think she
knows yet. I�ll use these people again I think, they know what they are doing
and the prices were OK. Not cheap but OK. They�ll trade in Sukie against the
new one and I�ll get a fair price.�

&nbsp;

�So, what about your new acquisition? The
one that came over in the Beaver with me.�

&nbsp;

�Ah yes,� Steve said, smiling. �She�s for
the stables.� 

&nbsp;

��Stables?� I said.

&nbsp;

�Yes. Didn�t Freddie tell you about my
little hobby?�

&nbsp;

�He said you had an eye for a fine filly
but that was about all.�

&nbsp;

�Well, I guess he was right in that. Come
and see.�

&nbsp;

Chapter 10: Horse Feathers

&nbsp;

The stables were just that, a low range of
buildings set around three sides of a cobbled yard round behind the house.
There were six stalls along either side and at the end of yard a carriage shed,
tack room and feed store provided all that was needed for the horses I assumed
to be kept there.

&nbsp;

My assumptions were confounded by what I
saw as we entered the yard. Hearing our feet on the cobbles, faces appeared
looking over the half doors of four of the stalls. Each was a young blonde
woman, Each wore a halter around their heads, ropes stretching around their
foreheads, around their neck and beneath their chin. .

&nbsp;

�Some of my fillies,� said Steve gesturing
to the girls. �They take some training but I like to think I produce the best
pony girls in the western hemisphere. I thought we�d look in on the new girl
and then take a carriage out for a trot.�

&nbsp;

�Why not?� I said, somewhat bemused by his
suggestion. He led the way to the last stall and opened the door. Sprawled on a
bed of straw, naked and asleep, was the girl that had been on the flight with
me. She too was wearing a head harness, with reins locked to it and in turn to
a ring at the back of her stall. Steve took a riding crop hanging from hook on
the side of the stall and tapped her lightly on the thigh with it. She woke up
suddenly, turning her head towards us. She gave a startled cry, rendered into a
grunt by the steel bit gag that stretched across her mouth. She tried to back
away from us but was stopped as she reached the end of her tethering rein.

&nbsp;

�Up! Up!� ordered Steve. �On your feet.�

&nbsp;

She tried to obey but found it difficult.
Her arms were fixed behind her in some way and her feet were locked into
curious boots that gave each the shape of a horse�s hoof. As she eventually got
to her feet it was obvious that the boots were also pushing her up on tip toe
as well.� 

&nbsp;

Steve gripped her reins and pulled her
towards him. �What do you think?� he said. �Nice conformation, I thought.� He
ran his had down the small of her back over her backside and down to her thighs
and calves. �Good hindquarters, firm fetlocks.� I nodded to agree. He turned
her to face us, the girl moving unsteadily on her hooves. �Right sort of chest
too.� He patted her breasts. �Quite small is best for pulling work. No good if
you�ve got big breasts swinging around. �Good mane, too.� He took a curry comb
from the shelf on the side of the stall and pulled it through her long loose
hair. �Needs a bit of attention after the flight but it�ll soon come up nice
and glossy. Still we�ll let her rest for now and give her a session on the
lunge rein later. That will start getting her used to walking and trotting on
her new hoofs. Back down girl. Back to sleep.� He watched as the girl carefully
curled her legs beneath her and lay back down on the straw. �Come on, Larry,�
he said, �I promised you a carriage ride.�

&nbsp;

He locked the stable door behind us as we
left the stall. The four others were still looking out of their stalls. Steve
went to each in turn offering them a piece of apple in his open palm, checking
their head bridles and patting them tenderly. They were all of similar height
and all with the same long blonde hair fastened back behind their heads. He
finished up at the farthest stall. �We�ll take this one,� he said. �You can
help me tack her up. You�ll find some harness on a hook labelled �Dawn� in the
tack room. He opened up the stall door as I went in search of the harness.
�Come on Dawn,� I heard him say. �Come on girl.�

&nbsp;

I found the harness without trouble and carried
it back into the yard where Steve was already leading Dawn up and down. She was
wearing the same hoof boots as the other girl but had evidently become
practiced in walking in them. �Right let�s get your harness on you girl and you
can do a bit of work,� Steve said to her. He took off her stable halter and
replaced it with the finer, black bridle from the harness I was carrying. �Give
me her snaffle, would you?� He held out his hand and I passed over the hinged
steel bar that he fitted across her mouth and clipped to the bridle. She ran
her tongue side to side beneath the metal, gave a short whinny and shook her
head. I watched as he fitted the reminder of her harness, leather straps across
her chest beneath her small tits were cut to support them and had clips that
linked to cuffs on her arms above the elbows to hold them in place. A broad
collar held her head erect. As he turned her around I saw that her arms were
held in a leather sleeve that fastened her fore arms together and covered her
hands. The harness also fitted around a butt plug from which draped a long tail
of hair that could well have been cut from her own head.�� 

&nbsp;

�Now, since we�re going to show you off,�
said Steve, affectionately. �I think we�ll add all the furniture. Hold her for
a moment, would you,� he said passing me her reins as he walked off towards the
tack room. Dawn looked at me without attempting to speak. She tossed her head
experimentally as I held her, so I tightened her rein. She responded to the
pressure and stood calmly. Steve returned. �Are you used to hoses?� he said.

&nbsp;

�I�ve not really had much to do with them,�
I replied. �My girlfriend used to ride, so I know a bit, but not much.�

&nbsp;

�Well, this one is quite a good beast. Not
too spirited but not shy of hard work either. Let�s put these on her.� Steve
fitted a pair of polished black blinkers to her bridle and then added a
splendid plume of feathers to the top. He also took two silver bells and
clipped them, one to each nipple. She gave a whinny through her snaffle as the
clips went on but was then quiet. �Now let�s get her between the shafts.�

&nbsp;

Shafting girls was something I had often
enjoyed, though not quite in this way. She was soon harnessed up to a small two
seat carriage. Steve picked a driving whip from the rack, invited me to take a
seat, got in beside me and urged Dawn out of the yard. �Go on girl, go on,� he
said tapping her lightly with the whip to get her started. She stepped away
carefully, picking her way across the ground with care nThe cart moved off at a
slow but steady pace, with Dawn�s bells tinkling at every step. Steve drove her
forward along a trail that led past the house and down towards the beach. We
reached the quay and stopped. �You see,� said Steve, �a quite practical mode of
transport. Let�s go back. I think its time for lunch.� He tugged at Dawn�s
reins, and flicked at her rump with the whip. �Go on girl, round you go.�

&nbsp;

Dawn pulled us back up the incline to the
stables. The cart turned into the yard just as Sukie appeared wearing the
tightest of jodhpurs, riding boots and a tee shirt. Steve pulled Dawn to a halt
with a short �whoa� and a pull on the reins. Sukie took the reins from Steve as
he and I got down from the carriage.

&nbsp;

�Good ride?� she asked.

&nbsp;

�Yes, fascinating,� I replied.

&nbsp;

Steve handed his driving whip to Sukie.
�Give her some water and then rub her down. She�ll need it after that trot.
Look in on the new pony and make sure she�s all right, then come and join us
for some lunch.�

&nbsp;

�Sure thing, Sir,� Sukie smiled and led
Dawn away towards the carriage shed, the carriage clattering across the cobbles
behind her, her tit bells jingling.

�

Half an hour later we were sat on Steve�s
veranda with two rum punches and a plate of blackened flying fish with some
rice and peas. We talked about the business. How he selected his ponies. I
asked him if he�d ever bought any from Freddie. He said, �No�. 

&nbsp;

It seemed that whenever he�d checked
Freddie�s stock or the auction catalogues there wasn�t anything right for what
he needed.

&nbsp;

�Which is what?� I said.

&nbsp;

�Tall; blonde for preference; thin, quite
fit, but small tits, definitely small tits. I guess that last one is against
the run of most people�s requirements.�

&nbsp;

�Well, I guess so too, but it can�t be
difficult to find them. Has anyone from our side ever asked you what you were
looking for?�

&nbsp;

�No, I don�t think so, no,� Steve said.
�But that�s really not the business you�re in is it? I mean you just grab them
and then see who you can sell them to?�

&nbsp;

�Well it looks like it�s been that way so
far,� I said.

�

Sukie joined us. She sat on the floor
beside Steve, smiling up at him. She�d find it hard when he told her she was to
be sold again, I thought. 

&nbsp;

Steve asked her to entertain me again for
the afternoon while he worked on the new pony. She came to my room an hour
later. This time she wasn�t bound or gagged.

Chapter&nbsp;11: Flying Home

&nbsp;

I was sorry to say good bye to the island,
Steve had been a good host and I�d learned a lot. Sukie had been agreeable
company � I was partly sorry that I wouldn�t be abe to scrape together the
asking price. Still there was work to do and so I was very pleased to have the
offer of flight back in a private jet owned by one of Steve�s associates. 

&nbsp;

I�d imagined a Lear Jet or a Citation but
when I turned up at the airport and found my way to the departure lounge I
found we were boarding something the size of a Boeing 737. There was about a dozen of us in the lounge including, I noticed,
the short sighted man from the Sales Centre that had bought Rebecca. He was
talking to a tall, blonde woman. She wore a dark blue uniform suit and carried
a peaked cap. Our pilot, I thought. She gave him a curt nod and headed off
towards the plane.�� 

&nbsp;

Boeing Business Jet, it said on the side of
the �plane and while it might have looked like a pretty ordinary small-sized
airliner on the outside, the inside was very different.

&nbsp;

We were greeted at the doorway by a smartly
dressed flight attendant and shown inside to something that looked more like a
gentleman�s club than the usual seat warehouse. There were small clusters of
seats, perhaps 20 in all, couches and tables, a large bar and plenty of space
to walk around. I took an empty seat and sat back while the rest of my fellow
passengers went through their rituals of stowing their bags and getting
comfortable.

&nbsp;

There were three flight attendants. I
wasn�t entirely surprise to see that two of them were Rebecca and Amanda.
Neither of them appeared to recognise me.

&nbsp;

The girl who had welcomed us on board
introduced herself as Elaine, our senior flight attendant, and began the usual
safety demonstration. Rebecca was in the front part of the cabin pointing out
the exits and doing her bit with the oxygen mask and the lifejacket. Just like
on most business flights the passengers carried on reading newspapers or
magazines or talking amongst themselves, paying scant
attention to what was being said. As the safety demonstration came to a close,
though I was suddenly conscious that the passengers were paying attention to
what was being said, putting their papers down and stopping their own
conversations.

&nbsp;

Elaine was still talking from the front of
the aircraft as we started to push back from the terminal. �Gentlemen, I hope
you will join me in welcoming two new crew members today,� she said. �They are
both having their first flight with us today, so I would like to introduce
them, In the front cabin we have Rebecca and in the
back cabin Amanda. Although they are new to us they are both experienced cabin
crew and will be able to deliver our usual range of in-flight services. Rebecca
and Amanda are joined by Brenda who some of you that have flown before with us
will all ready know.�

&nbsp;

That was nice, I thought, I�d never had
Becky wait on me hand and foot in the air, or at home come to that.

&nbsp;

�And of course gentlemen that includes the
usual range of massages and sexual services. Please just ask your attendant for
anything you require. Amanda, Becky, if you could show our guests what is
available.� Rebecca appeared to hesitate for a moment. Elaine stared at her.
�Please Rebecca, I think you know what to do.�

&nbsp;

She turned back to face us, unbuttoned her
dark blue jacket and removed it. The white shirt she wore beneath it was sheer
and it was clear that beneath it she wore a quarter cup bra that forced her
tits up, pushing her nipples against the tight sheer fabric of the blouse. She took
off the blouse and put that with her jacket. Without pausing she unzipped her
skirt and stepped out of it revealing garter belt, stockings and a thong. She
put the skirt with her other clothes and walked slowly up and down the aisle
between the seats. I heard some approving grunts from my fellow passengers. She
walked through into the rear cabin. Amanda, having stripped in the same way,
came through to our cabin giving us all a good look at her talents. She
returned the back and Rebecca rejoined us.

&nbsp;

Elaine spoke again. �There we are
gentlemen. Just press the call button by your seats for anything you require. Thank you girls.� Rebecca and Amanda put their clothes on
again. The aircraft had reached the runway. �Flight attendants, seats for take
off please,� she said. The girls strapped themselves in the jump seats just
inside the cabin door and the �plane started down the runway with the usual
combination of disconcerting thumps, bangs and roaring noises. Moments later we
were airborne, wheels and flaps up, heading back towards Europe.

&nbsp;

Most of my fellow passengers were busy on
their lap tops by the time the plane levelled out. Rebecca and Amanda, jackets
off, wandered through the cabin offering drinks. Nobody seemed keen to follow
up on Elaine�s offer. I felt it was churlish not to; besides it was an
opportunity to fulfil a long-held fantasy.

&nbsp;

Rebecca placed the drink I�d asked for on
the table beside me. I looked up at her. �You don�t remember me do you?� I
asked as she stared blankly at me.

&nbsp;

�No, Sir. Should I? This is my first
flight. Have you flown with us before?�

&nbsp;

�No, that�s all right. I thought I
remembered you from before you worked here.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, no, Sir. I�ve only worked for this airline.�

&nbsp;

I wasn�t sure that I followed the logic but
I could see that whatever had happened to her during her training had blotted
out any memory of her previous life.

&nbsp;

�That�s all right,� I said, �it must be my mistake.� I took a sip from my drink. �I heard
that you are available to us during the flight. Is that right?�

&nbsp;

Yes of course Sir. I can entertain you here
in your seat or there is a bed in a cubicle towards the back of the �plane.� 

&nbsp;

�No. Go to the washroom but leave the door
unlocked. You can entertain me in there.� There was a long time fantasy that I
now had the chance to turn into reality.

&nbsp;

�But Sir, surely the cubicle would be more
comfortable.�

&nbsp;

�Perhaps but I�d like to take you in the
washroom, thank you.�

&nbsp;

�Of course Sir, if that�s what you desire.
I�ll just return this tray to the galley.�

&nbsp;

I watched her arse as she walked back to
the galley. She emerged a moment later and went to the washroom. I followed her
in. It was fairly spacious compared with a regular flight but even so there
wasn�t too much room. �Right,� I said pushing her back against the door and
sliding the lock closed, �you�re going to get fucked.�

&nbsp;

�Sir, there�s no need to force me. I�m
expected to look after the passengers as I said.�

&nbsp;

�No need perhaps, but maybe I like it that
way. Give me your belt.�

&nbsp;

�Very good sir,� she said, doing as she was
ordered.

&nbsp;

I wrapped the thin strap around her wrists
and knotted it. I hoisted her hands over her head and tied them to the coat
hook on the back of the washroom door. She gave a short, �Oh!�

&nbsp;

I grabbed a handful of paper towels from
the dispenser and jammed them into her mouth. �Shut up, bitch,� I said as I
pulled her blouse from her skirt and unbuttoned it. She squealed as I pinched
and squeezed at her tits. I put my hand over her lips and she choked and
coughed as it pushed the wad of towels deeper into her mouth.

&nbsp;

I swung her around and dragged her skirt up
over her hips. I pulled her pants down around her knees. Her arse was framed by
her garter belt and stockings. I took her from behind, grunting as I pushed my
cock inside her lifting her up on her toes as I pushed up under her. She
whimpered into the paper gag as I came. It was great.

&nbsp;

I pulled the gag from her mouth and let her
wrists off the coat hook, she fell to her knees on the floor, sobbing. �Clean
me up,� I ordered. 

&nbsp;

She looked up at me and composed herself. �Of course, Sir. I won�t be a moment.� She reached for my
cock and took it in her mouth. Licking and sucking the cum
from it. It didn�t take long before I was erect again but I knew from long
experience that there wasn�t much point in her carrying on. She�d had as much
of my juice as there was likely to be for a while.

&nbsp;

�That�s enough,� I said pushing her back on
her heels as I zipped my fly. I turned my back on her, left her on the floor of
the washroom and returned to my seat. I wasn�t very proud of myself, I guess,
but I had enjoyed it.

&nbsp;

Rebecca followed me a little later, having
dressed herself and reapplied her make up. She made her way between the seats
again asking if the passengers wanted drinks. A fat, florid, red haired man a
little way away from me started a conversation with her. She returned wearing
her uniform jacket, hat and gloves.� Soon
she was on her knees gobbling greedily at his cock, while the man toyed with
her hair.

&nbsp;

As she finished and got to her feet I
pressed the call button. She looked up and walked slowly over to me. Her make
up was messed again and there were splatters of the man�s cum on her blouse
where it had dribbled from her chin. She seemed unconcerned. �Can I help you,
Sir?� she asked.

&nbsp;

�Another vodka when you have a minute, please,� I said.

&nbsp;

�Of course, Sir, I�ll just be a minute if
that�s all right.�

&nbsp;

�That�s fine,� I said.

&nbsp;

The short sighted man came through from the
back of the �plane and sat down beside me. He held out his hand. �Narod
Jesper,� he said by way of introduction. �I think these two are pretty good
value, don�t you?� he said nodding towards Rebecca.

&nbsp;

�It must have been handy for you to be able
to get two fully trained cabin crew for this, Mr
Jesper.�

&nbsp;

�Cheaper than training them myself,� he chortled. �But that�s the great thing about auctions, you can pick up some real bargains. It�s a lot
easier than recruiting them myself like I did with the other one - what�s her
name? -� Brenda. Anyway, how�s your work
for Clegg coming along?�

&nbsp;

�Interesting.� I said. �I�m learning a lot and the benefits are good. Oh, thanks
for the flight, by the way. And the in-flight services.�

&nbsp;

�That�s OK, happy to do you the favour. I�d
rented out some hold space to Freddie on this trip anyway. He had a couple of
packages he needed back in the UK and
its easier for him to use me than regular cargo flights if I�m coming
across.��� 

&nbsp;

�Are all the passengers buyers?� I asked.

&nbsp;

�I couldn�t possibly say,� Jesper replied,
with a chuckle. �That would be most indiscrete. But if you were to see any of
these people at one of Mr Clegg�s little events I wouldn�t be at all surprised.
Why do you ask?�

&nbsp;

�Well,� I said, looking around, �I�d say
the profile of people here is a bit different to the one�s I�ve seen at
Freddie�s. There�s what, a third of them women? And a third
under thirty? 

&nbsp;

�Yes, something like
that. I�m afraid that the more mature buyer like myself
will soon be in the minority.�

&nbsp;

�I thought so,� I said. �Interesting.�


&nbsp;

�I�m sure that I might be able to persuade
one or other of them to chat if it would help your research. They�re often
pleased to have a chance to sound off. Unless you�re planning
to sleep off your bout of exercise?�

&nbsp;

�No, not just yet. I�ll get some sleep later on but if you can introduce me I�d like
to get another perspective.�

&nbsp;

�OK, I�ll see what I can do.� 

&nbsp;

He headed off into the rear cabin. A few
minutes later a rather dumpy woman put her head around the partition, obviously
looking for someone. It turned out to be me. �You�d be Larry,� she said, sitting
down heavily in the seat next to me. She held out a rather limp hand. �Daphne
Challis,� she said in a quiet New England accent. �Our host said you�d like a chat.� She nodded towards the
rear cabin.

&nbsp;

�Did he say what about?� I looked at her.
She was overweight and didn�t carry it well. She wore a rather muddy brown
tweed jacket and skirt. Her greasy hair hung lankly to her shoulders. She was
sucking on the stub of an unlit cigar. I guessed it was some consolation on a 6
hour non-smoking flight. She reached up and pressed the call button.

&nbsp;

�Uh, yes,� she said. Rebecca appeared in
response to the call. �Gin and tonic for me,� she said. �Anything
for you?� I shook my head. �And some nuts or crisps,
snacks.� She turned back towards me as Rebecca left us. �I guess I don�t
look like your idea of a lady slave owner.�

&nbsp;

I shrugged my shoulders. Actually, she
didn�t look my idea of a lady anything.

&nbsp;

�Well, whatever. It wasn�t what I thought I
was going to do either. I just needed some help around the house and a friend
suggested they could get me some that would very attentive help. Turned out it
involved owning rather than hiring. I was happy with that; too much legislation
over employees these days. I guess I�m a fairly typical buyer that way, I have three or four at any one time. Trade them in
when I get bored or they prove unsuitable.�

&nbsp;

Rebecca returned with Daphne�s drink and
snacks on a tray. She picked up the glass and grabbed greedily at the nuts and
biscuits with her other hand. Rebecca went to leave. �No, wait,� said Daphne,
putting her drink back on the tray and grabbing another handful of nuts.
Rebecca stood patiently by.

&nbsp;

�Are these males or females,� I asked. I
hadn�t seen Clegg dealing in male slaves but I guessed that it was possible, if
there was a market.

&nbsp;

�I�d intended men originally,� she said. �and that would have been really easy. Just advertise
yourself as some dominatrix and they line up. And pay you for it too!� She
looked disgusted and crammed some more nuts in. �I tried a couple. Hopeless. They just need too much attention. I haven�t got
the time. And besides I decided I quite liked a little female company. This
one,� she took a sip from her drink and pointed to Rebecca, �is a real
treasure, isn�t she?� I watched as Daphne�s free hand pushed up under Rebecca�s
skirt and started fondling her arse. Rebecca�s nipples stiffened visibly under
her blouse. �I like them like this,� she said. �Good tits, nice arse. I keep my
house slaves corseted and bare breasted, they need to look good.� Her hand came
out from Rebecca�s skirt to grab some more nuts. 

&nbsp;

Maybe they need to look good, I thought,
but I didn�t think I�d like to see her naked with the rate she was going
through the snacks. �So, have you bought any from Clegg?�

&nbsp;

�No,� she said. �It�s all a bit of a boy�s
club isn�t it? Well, old man�s club really, no disrespect. Just a bit behind
the times the way they do things. I spend my time making money or enjoying it,
I haven�t got time to waste going off to his auctions. There�s easier and
better ways to get hold of what I need. Mind you I like Brits as slaves, they
seem to have the whole behaving respectfully thing down to a fine art. Clegg�s
got a good reputation for British merchandise. If I really wanted a British
item specifically then maybe it�d be worth the trouble.�

&nbsp;

�So no one from there has ever talked to
you about the things they can do?�

&nbsp;

�No, I can�t say they have. I mean I know
Clegg�s got some good snatch teams and some good intelligence gathering too by
all accounts but they�ve never approached me that I remember.� 

&nbsp;

�Well, thanks,� I said. �That�s a help.�

&nbsp;

�That�s OK. Now if you�ll excuse me I need
to get a bit of sleep before we reach the other end.� With that she got to her
feet, brushing the crumbs she had dropped into her lap down onto the floor. She
looked at the debris and then at Rebecca. �You�d better clean that up, girl.�

&nbsp;

�Of, course, Ma�am,� Rebecca responded
respectfully, �I�ll do it straight away.�

&nbsp;

�Good,� Daphne responded, �and when you�ve
done come back to my seat.� I�ve thought
of something that will help me get off to sleep.� Rebecca disappeared. �Daphne
turned for the after cabin. �Call me sometime if you start doing anything
interesting. Clegg�s got my number.� She picked up her gin, drained the last
drop, pulled the slice of lemon from the glass and sucked it clean. �You never
know, we might be able to do some business.�

&nbsp;

As she went back to her seat the third
stewardess appeared beside my seat. I looked up at her, �Brenda Alexander�, her
badge said. 

&nbsp;

�Hi,� she said in a warm Texan drawl. �I
just wanted to make sure you were enjoying the flight, Sir. And to see if there
was anything more that I or the other girls could do for you.�

&nbsp;

I decided to take advantage of the fact
that I hardly felt like sleeping. �Yes,� I said there is. �Come and talk to me
for a moment.�

&nbsp;

Brenda looked surprised by the suggestion.

&nbsp;

�Have a seat,� I said. 

&nbsp;

�I�m not really supposed to sit down with
the passengers, Sir,� she replied. �I could kneel here if that would be
alright.�� I nodded and she did so.

&nbsp;

�I know how Rebecca and Amanda came to be
here,� I said. �How about you? Were you bought at
auction like them? Tell me.�

&nbsp;

The short sighted man was passing my seat.
Brenda looked up at him, concerned. �That�s all right, Brenda, tell him
anything he wants to know. And if there�s anything else he wants, see to that
too. You know the rules.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, of course, Sir,� she said. He nodded
and went on forward. She folded her hands in her lap and began. �Well, it seems
a silly story, really. I don�t know there is much to tell. I was working for
another airline, mainly short haul flights around the south western USA, and
I saw an advert for a start-up business charter airline with the opportunity to
do some long haul trips too. It seemed like the opportunity to get in at the
start of something so I applied.�

&nbsp;

�Go on,� I said. 

&nbsp;

�Well, I very nearly didn�t get to the
interview. It was in a hotel on the airfield I was flying into and I�d arranged
to go straight over to the hotel when I landed. Anyway there was a flight
delay, air traffic control problems, we were an hour
late in landing. I tried ringing the number they had given me as soon as I got
down but couldn�t get through. I thought I�d missed my chance. I practically
ran through the terminal building and across the car park lot. I was still in
my uniform, I�d intended to change but I just didn�t have the time.�

&nbsp;

�OK,� I said. �Look while you tell me this,
open your blouse. I got a good look at Rebecca and Amanda at the start of the
flight but you must have been in the rear cabin.

&nbsp;

�I was looking after Mr Jesper,� she said,
apparently embarrassed but starting to unfasten her blouse nevertheless. I had
a good idea of what �looking after Mr Jesper� would mean. She looked up at me
as she finished opening her blouse. I nodded approvingly at the sight of her
tits. �Should I unfasten my bra as well, Sir?� she asked.

&nbsp;

�Yes please, Brenda, that
would be excellent. Then put your hands behind your back, please.� I watched as
she did so and then urged her to continue with her tale.

&nbsp;

�Well I got to the suite they were using
for interviews. There was a receptionist that tried to fob me off, that they�d
finished, and they had already offered the job to someone. But I wasn�t going
to be put off. I pushed by and into the suite of rooms they were using for
interviews. The first two rooms were empty and then I burst into the third
room. There were two men in there. I�d obviously startled them, they turned
round suddenly. I saw there was a girl slumped in the chair beside them. It was
Elaine although I didn�t know her then of course. I don�t know how I could have
been so stupid looking back. Is she alright, I said, I�ve had first aid
training. Can I help? I was just so keen to help I didn�t think what might have
happened. Anyway the first man said that she�d suddenly fainted or something
and could I do anything. I bent over the girl and went to check her breathing.
I heard the two men say something. I�m not sure what but now I realise they
were agreeing to take me as well. Then I felt a sharp pain in my backside and
everything went black.�

&nbsp;

�I see,� I was pleased by her frankness. I
reached out for one of her nipples and squeezed it. She gave a short gasp but
didn�t pull away. �Go on.�

&nbsp;

�Well when I woke up I couldn�t move.
They�d tied the two of us up. We were laying back to
back, my hands were tied in front of Elaine�s waist, hers in front of mine,
They�d roped our ankles together as well. My mouth was stuffed full of
something and all I could do was grunt and whimper, whatever they�d used it was
tied into my mouth with a rope that went around Elaine�s mouth as well,
whenever I tried to move my head, the back of her head banged against mine.. I
caught sight of the two of us in a mirror on the far side of the room. They�d
strapped tape across my mouth too. The two of us were wriggling and struggling
but it didn�t do too much good. Then the two men and the receptionist came back
in. They were arguing about me. The receptionist was furious, she was saying
that they were only supposed to collect one and that the whole expensive
exercise was in danger of being a complete shambles. The man bent down beside
me and pulled my skirt up. Look at the legs, he said. Too good to let those go.
The other man bent down beside me and tugged at my shirt. Nice tits too, he
said. come on she�s worth bringing along too. The
receptionist seemed to relent and said that it would probably be all right but
that she�d have to clear it. The men said if she didn�t want me they�d find a
way of making use of me. I can�t remember when I�ve been so scared. Anyway��

&nbsp;

She was about to continue when Elaine, the
senior stewardess appeared. �I�m sorry to interrupt, Sir,� she said. �But Mr Jesper� said when you
have finished with Brenda he�d like to see her in the cubicle.� 

&nbsp;

Brenda looked uncomfortable. �I really
should go,� she said.

&nbsp;

�That�s all right,� I said. �I can hardly
deny the owner his pleasures.�

&nbsp;

�Thank you, Sir,� said Elaine. �Can I get
you one of the other girls?�

&nbsp;

�No,� I said, �that�s fine.�� I watched as Elaine helped Brenda to her
feet. She made no attempt to button her blouse. Elaine reached up to the
overhead locker and pulled out a seat belt demonstration strap. She pulled it
around Brenda�s neck and used it to lead the girl as if on a leash towards the
back of the plane.

&nbsp;

Whatever else I had learned on this trip it
was clear that Jesper had got a bargain from the auction � Rebecca and Amanda
had to have been cheaper for him than commissioning a pick up like the one he�d
used for Brenda and Elaine. I was beginning to feel that Freddie was being
taken advantage of and I couldn�t imagine that he would be pleased by the idea.

Chapter 12: SWOT versus SWAT

&nbsp;

I got back to the London offices the
following day. A comfortable flight had made it easier but I was still
suffering from jet lag. Still I doubted that I was feeling as rough as the
packages that had been in the hold.

&nbsp;

Freddie gave me a call and suggested a
meeting. He wanted an update on progress. I was happy that I had some ideas
after my various trips. We agreed to meet in the board room the following
afternoon.

&nbsp;

Clegg arrived on time, looking in as good
humour as he usually was. �Afternoon Larry. Good trip?
Well I guess we�ll hear about that. Not a bad bunch out there. Hope they looked
after you.�

&nbsp;

�It was fine,� I said. �everyone
was very helpful. I got some good ideas, I think.�

&nbsp;

�OK,� said Clegg. �That�s what you�re here
for. How do you want to do this?�

&nbsp;

�I�d like to talk through my thoughts using
a few tools that I find helpful, basically summarising what I�ve learned over
the last few weeks.� 

&nbsp;

�You seemed to have learned how to enjoy
yourself, young man, if what I hear of your trip is right. That�s all to the
good. Don�t look so worried, I�m quite happy for you to take advantage of any
opportunity � its part of the package as far as I�m concerned.�

&nbsp;

I gave an embarrassed
cough. �Well, thanks. Yes, there was some fun but I thought I�d try to focus on
the things I�ve learned about the business. Then we can agree what we want to
do about it.�

&nbsp;

�Fine by me. You lead off.� 

�

�One of the things I have done is a SWOT
analysis,� I said turning to the flip chart that stood beside the board table.

&nbsp;

�Special Weapons And
Tactics?� asked Clegg looking puzzled.

&nbsp;

�Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and
Threats,� I explained as I drew the board into four segments, S, W, O &amp; T.

&nbsp;

�Ah,� Clegg responded. �I see.�

&nbsp;

�I�ll write up the things I think I�ve got
from the meetings and visits of the past few weeks. If you want to pitch in
with any thoughts as we go along, feel free to do so.�

&nbsp;

�Ha! Going to have to work for my living am I? OK�

&nbsp;

�I�ll start with the strengths. The
research team is a definite plus.� I wrote �RESEARCH TEAM� up on the board. �All the clients that I spoke to reckon that you�ve got one of the
best research teams in the business. Plus your snatch teams think the
research is pretty good too. They don�t get many surprises when they are on a
job.�

&nbsp;

�So how does that help us?�

&nbsp;

�Well, I don�t want to jump to any
conclusions, let�s look at the other factors. Hacking � that�s something your
team is pretty good at too.� I added that to the list. �Plenty of others have
been making use of the Internet but your team seem to have got further on than
most. In fact the whole IT side seems pretty strong to me.�

&nbsp;

�I�d have thought the fact that we can
deliver all over the world was a strength -, don�t
you?� Clegg joined in.

&nbsp;

�Well, certainly it�s something the
organisation does and it�s perfectly good at. Virtually all of your competitors
do it as well though, so I don�t think it can be considered a particular
strength. I didn�t hear anyone saying you could do anything that others can�t. I
think you can only really count the things that are different or better than
competitors � otherwise you just end up being a �me too� operation.�

&nbsp;

�Hmm, yes. See what you mean. Never been my goal to be like the rest of the
herd.�

&nbsp;

�But one other feature that was mentioned
was your knowledge of the UK as a
source of product. All of your clients said that was a big feature and
important to them as well. It seems there some markets where UK
product is a plus and you�re definitely seen as the expert.�

&nbsp;

�OK, that�s encouraging anyway. Any others?� I shook my head. Freddie looked concerned but
pressed on. �How about weaknesses?�

&nbsp;

�Well, something your clients talk about is
a lack of choice � they feel once you get stuck into a commission there�s not
much chance to influence what�s going on.�

&nbsp;

�Well, that�s inevitable, isn�t it?. You can�t go changing operations in mid-stream.�

&nbsp;

�Maybe not but your competitors give their
clients the feeling that they have more flexibility.�

&nbsp;

�Uh, huhh, OK,�
said Clegg warily. �Mm, well we ought to be taking account of the competition.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, yes. I think we can assume that if
we�re doing things right they will respond in some way. For now though I�m
mainly interested in doing things our customers want that the competition aren�t doing or that the competition is doing
better than us. That�s why I thought about the auctions.�

&nbsp;

�Hang on,� said Clegg. �We�ve got one of
the best Auction Centres that I know. You can�t say that�s a weakness.�

&nbsp;

�Well, I agree the Centre itself is
impressive. The problem is that there aren�t enough buyers and because there
aren�t enough buyers you�re not getting as good a price as you could. If you
could get a bigger audience you could find prices going up. Or
if you could make things so that you really exploit the specialised talents of
the stock. Take the chap who runs the business jet I flew back on. He
got two fully trained cabin crew at one of our
auctions for about what he�d have expected to pay for any two pieces in their
mid-twenties. He got a real bargain. I think you end up under valuing the
stock.�

&nbsp;

�I see what you mean. Certainly prices have
seem depressed but I�d put that down to a more general market trend.�

&nbsp;

�There�s no evidence to support that. In
fact from my discussions some of your customers are paying higher prices from
your competitors, not lower.�

&nbsp;

�Ha! Not my idea of the best way to do
business.�

&nbsp;

�I think it stems from a number of
problems. Customers just don�t think you�re interested in what they want, just
in what you have to sell, so they come to see what you have to offer as an
opportunity for a bargain, nothing more.� I wrote �Don�t handle MY problems� up
under weaknesses.�

&nbsp;

�All right.�

&nbsp;

�And the other thing is the stock that you
carry.� I added �STOCK� that to the list.

&nbsp;

�Can�t sell what you haven�t got,� said
Freddie, furrowing his brow.

&nbsp;

�A common view but not
always true. Sometimes you can sell what you
know you can get. I think what I mean is that there doesn�t seem to be any
control over what stock you bring in or when. It seems like the snatch teams
just pour stock in at one end and the Sales Centre has
to find ways to shift it.�

&nbsp;

�Hmm, I�m not sure that�s completely fair
but there may be something in what you say. Certainly we had to clear a lot
last year.�

� 

�OK. Well, the strengths and weaknesses all
tend to be about what your business does. The opportunities and threats are all
about external factors. I�m not sure I�ve really got to grips with this yet but
here�s a couple of thoughts. There�s
a growing number of women buyers in the market � that�s got to be an
opportunity and I�m not sure that anyone�s really catering specifically for
them. Then there�s the younger buyers too. Again there
are signs that the average age of buyers is coming down � a few people have
said that. Again, I don�t see anyone shaping up to that.�

&nbsp;

�Interesting,
interesting. Well, if we�re looking for threats,
there�s always the forces of law and order.�

&nbsp;

�Well, yes, but again that�s pretty much
the same for everyone isn�t it? I guess if you have more problems because
you�re based here in the UK we
could consider it a weakness but otherwise it�s just what this market is all
about, isn�t it?��� 

&nbsp;

OK, yes, I see what you mean. It�s probably
the same for all of us. It�s no worse here than in the States or most of the
other EU countries. Maybe a bit better at the moment with
most of them off worrying about counter-terrorism rather than us.� 

&nbsp;

I ran through a few more thoughts but I
could see Clegg�s attention was wandering. Time to cut to the chase, I thought.

&nbsp;

�So here�s what I think we should do,� I
said. Clegg sat up. �Have you heard of the �4P�s�?�

&nbsp;

He shook his head.

&nbsp;

�It�s a way we talk about the mix of
factors you need in a marketing approach: product, price, place and promotion.�

&nbsp;

�OK, I get it,� said Clegg.

�

�Well here are my thoughts.� I turned over
a clean sheet on the flip pad and wrote: 

&nbsp;

����������� Product
� UK females that meet specific customer requirements.

&nbsp;

����������� Price
� premium priced for a premium service

&nbsp;

����������� Place
� Eastern Europe, Middle East, Far East

&nbsp;

����������� Promotion
� account managed approach supported by video / web

����������������������� �+ explore opportunities in new markets (women
/ younger buyers)�� 

&nbsp;

Clegg looked at it. �Go on,� he said,
carefully.

&nbsp;

�My view is that the future of Clegg
Enterprises lies with higher value niche opportunities rather than the mass
markets. I recognise some of these, especially the US, seem
attractive and appear to be the areas of largest growth today but all my
research indicates that these buyers will move to becoming more discriminating
over time. The skills of the business in research and specialist acquisition of
stock will match the emerging demands of the market for particular items. I�d
recommend that Clegg Enterprises defocuses on the current auction approach and
instead looks towards an approach in which buyers are encouraged to specify
their requirements directly and indeed get fully engaged in the selection and
acquisition process. Over time we would aim to migrate more of the current
clientele to buying in the way that the most profitable customers do.�

&nbsp;

�OK, I can see the sense of that. I guess
the big questions are how do we do it and how do we fund it?�

&nbsp;

�Let�s talk about how we should do it
first. I�ve got some ideas that should prove simple to put into practice for
starters. Firstly I�d like to start an account management approach with some of
the current clients. Assigning a particular contact to them to be responsible
for knowing their requirements and working with them on how we can meet them. I
mean, for example, when I was out on the island, it was clear that Steve Glennis has a number of projects in mind that we could help
him with, he hadn�t thought about talking to us. If someone had been talking to
him, understanding his projects, we�d have been able to make suggestions and with
the research skills we�d have been able to find just what he wanted.� 

&nbsp;

�So instead of waiting for him to turn up
at an auction,� Clegg began.

&nbsp;

�Which he may or may not do,� I said. �And
in fact he hadn�t for over a year until last month.�

&nbsp;

�� instead of
that, we work with him on specific acquisition projects.�

&nbsp;

�We follow that up with an approach that
lets clients review and comment on our plans - we could use some sort of secure
web technology; share the surveillance stuff with clients; get them to comment
on the girls before we pick them up. The idea should be that we move to more
acquisitions for specific projects and fewer speculative collections. If we
make things specific enough for people they�ll pay a lot more, we�ll be able to
command a premium price because we�ll be getting the customer just exactly what
they want.��� 

&nbsp;

�Well, it�s funny you should say that I mean
that�s how I started out. I mean apart from my own little hobby activities, the
first professional job I did was for a guy who was infatuated with a girl. He
tried to date her and she laughed him off. I told him I could get him what he
wanted and I did. He came up with a big wad of cash, very grateful he was. That
was the seed funding for Clegg Enterprises.� He went on, �But your ideas are
going to need cash too. So how do you propose funding it?�

&nbsp;

�You�re going to think this a bit radical,�
I said.

&nbsp;

�I like radical if it solves the problem,�
Clegg responded.

&nbsp;

�OK,� I took a deep breath. �Close the
Sales Centre.�

&nbsp;

Clegg spluttered, �But that cost us a
fortune to set up! �I thought you
marketing guys were all about better selling.�

&nbsp;

�Nah � marketing�s about getting people to
buy. I bet it did cost you a fortune to set up. And it�s costing you a fortune
to run. It�s expensive and you don�t actually need it. It isn�t much used apart
from the auction suite. It�s much better to go to the customers. If you need
them to come to you, use the London Club. 

&nbsp;

�But what about the
warehousing facilities and re-sales and the auctions?�

&nbsp;

�There�s probably enough space at the Prep
Centre. If we�re doing more collection against specific requirements then we
should need less warehousing anyway � not point in keeping stock if we don�t
need to. I think you can use the Internet more for auctions of any commodity
stuff, we�ll still get �opportunities� presenting themselves and I don�t
propose we should turn them down. But when you do use an auction you need to
get to a wider customer base � it�s all got a bit cosy at present and you don�t
get the prices you should because there just aren�t enough bidders involved.�� 

&nbsp;

Clegg looked thoughtful and then seemed to
come to a conclusion. �All right let�s go with this,� he said. �You try your
account management approach with one or two clients and see if that works. Go
make a video about what we are up to � I like that idea - but don�t spend too
much money on it. And you can get Technical to do a feasibility study on the
Internet service. How does that sound?�

&nbsp;

�Fine, that�ll let us make a start. And the
Sales Centre?�

&nbsp;

�I�ll think about it. We�ll talk about it
again after you�ve done this first bit. I�ll set you up with a couple of
clients to go talk about their requirements.�

&nbsp;

�OK,� I said. �Fine by
me. Just make sure that Research are teed up to
play their part.�

�

�Don�t worry, Larry, you�ll get all the
help you need. Oh and you�d better go have a chat with Harry, I can imagine
that field operations are going to be working harder.�

&nbsp;

Harry proved difficult to track down but
eventually I got him to answer his mobile. �Can we chat,� I said.

&nbsp;

�Sure,� said Harry but I�m a bit up to my
ears in it right now. I�ve got an operation in hand but if you want to come up
here I�d be OK with that.�

&nbsp;

�OK,� I said. �Where�s
�here� then?� He gave me an address in a small town about 20 miles away
from the Prep Centre. I took the train from Euston. It wasn�t much later
arriving than I�d expected and a short walk from the station found me outside a
door sandwiched between a greengrocers and a pet shop. There was only one bell.
I pushed it.

&nbsp;

Harry�s voice crackled through a small
brass grill, �Yup?�

&nbsp;

�It�s Larry,� I said.

&nbsp;

�Come on up,� he replied, the lock buzzed
and I pushed the door open. A narrow staircase led upwards. At the top of the
stairs was a glass panelled door that opened into a scruffy reception area.
Behind the empty reception desk was a door into an inner office. Harry put his
head around the door and waved me in. �Larry,� he said, �excellent. There�s
someone I want you to meet.�

&nbsp;

Sat in the chair beside a large desk was a
cheerful looking, red haired girl. She got to her feet as soon as I got into
the room. �Hello,� she said, enthusiastically, �I�m Sarah.�

&nbsp;

�Hi,� I said giving Harry a quizzical look,
unclear if she was part of Clegg Enterprises or not.

&nbsp;

�Sarah�s my new PA,� Harry said. �Or at
least she will be if she decides to accept the offer.�

&nbsp;

�Don�t be silly,� she said, �of course I�ll
accept. It all sounds very exciting, import, export, all that. Much better than the dull old car dealers.�

&nbsp;

�Sarah is currently working in the motor
trade,� said Harry.

&nbsp;

�Well I can see that might be less
exciting,� I said guardedly. �Was your last job very dull?�

&nbsp;

�Awful,� she said. �And the boss couldn�t
keep his hands to himself. Furtive groping, if you know what I mean.� She gave
a conspiratorial wink.

&nbsp;

�I can�t see you having that problem with
Harry,� I said. �There�s nothing furtive about him.�

&nbsp;

�Do you want a coffee?� Harry offered,
interrupting the banter. I nodded. He pulled a note from his wallet and tossed
it to Sarah. �Can you pop across the road and pick us up a couple of
cappuccinos, Sarah? And grab one for yourself if you�re stopping.�

&nbsp;

�Sure thing, boss,� Sarah said with a grin.
�Coffees coming up.� With that she bounced passed me
and down the stairs.

&nbsp;

�Does she know what we do?� I asked as the
door slammed behind her.

&nbsp;

�No, not at all.�

&nbsp;

�Won�t that make things, err, rather
difficult?�

&nbsp;

�Not with what I�ve got planned. I wasn�t
thinking of employing her as such, just sort of acquiring her.�

&nbsp;

�Ah, silly of me,� I said. �And is this
soon?�

&nbsp;

�Well, yes, right about now actually. If
you hang on a minute I�ll have got it all sorted out.�

&nbsp;

Sarah reappeared with the coffees. �Here
they are, I hope they are all right,� she said. She shrugged off her jacket and
I could see why Harry was keen on having her around. I guessed she was in her
early twenties, twenty two or three maybe. Her shoulder length, red, wavy hair
was striking in itself and the dark green top she wore clung agreeably to her
figure. She didn�t have big tits but they were neat, well formed and pert and
the fact that she had a trim figure made them look bigger than they really
were. Her dark skirt was probably a bit tight and a bit short really but I
wasn�t complaining. Her pale complexion and freckled face made me think that
the hair inside her knickers would match that on her head. �Here you are boys,�
she said, setting the coffees down between us.

&nbsp;

�Thanks Sarah, that�s great. Now can you
organise something for me, please?�

&nbsp;

�That�s why I�m here,� she reached for a
note pad, �fire away.�

&nbsp;

�All right, can you call this number 07788
656556. The gentleman concerned is expecting to have confirmation that a
shipment will be ready today? If you can just call him and tell him that it
will be ready as agreed. Oh, and I need to meet him. Can you suggest that he
and I get together this evening at the Red Bull on the Warwick Road say, oh
half past seven. Then I need you to pick up a few things for me, nothing to do
with work I�m afraid, personal stuff, I hope you don�t mind?�

&nbsp;

�Of course not. That�s all part of the job.�

&nbsp;

�Well it�s just that I�ve got some stuff I
need to package up and put into storage. Can you pop into the DIY Centre and
get 50 feet of three quarter inch rope, a couple of rolls of duct tape and some
Hessian sacks. If you can get that it�ll make things a lot easier.�

&nbsp;

Sarah jotted the details down on her pad.
�No problem at all, boss,� she said brightly. �Shall I bring this stuff in
tomorrow?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, ah, no. Look tell you what, why don�t you bring it out to the Red Bull, and
I can introduce you to this chap. You�ll need to meet him sometime. I might
even buy you a drink.�

&nbsp;

�Goodness, can I trust my new boss, I ask
myself?� Sarah giggled.

&nbsp;

�Very wise, very wise,� said Harry with
mock seriousness. 

&nbsp;

Sarah giggled again. �Still this is great,�
she said. �My last boss really kept me chained to my desk.�

&nbsp;

�And I�ll do the same if you aren�t working
well,� said Harry with a grin. �In fact maybe we�ll use heavier chains if
you�re not doing so well, lighter ones for better performance.� 

&nbsp;

�Oh, you are funny,� Sarah said, grinning,
as she picked up her coffee. �I�d better get back to work.� She went back out
to the reception office.

&nbsp;

I briefed Harry on the outcome of my
discussions with Clegg. I left out my thoughts on the Sales Centre. Harry
seemed to like the approach and said he�d be happy to support any of the
acquisitions that might fall out of it. His only comment was that Brian wasn�t
going to be pleased if it meant less going through the Sales Centre. We�d been
talking for about half an hour when Sarah knocked on the office door.

&nbsp;

�I�ve spoken to the gentleman,� she said,
�and that�s all fine he�ll see you at 7:30. And he says, thanks for
arranging the shipment he�ll be able to pick it up as agreed. Now, do you mind
if I get off? If I�m going to get those other things you wanted.�

&nbsp;

�No, that�s fine. Are you sure you�ve got
everything on that list?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, here it is,� she took out the paper,
�rope, tape, sacking. Nothing else?�

&nbsp;

�No, I don�t think so, no that will be
fine.� Harry smiled as Sarah turned to pick up her jacket and go. She stopped
at the door to Harry�s office.

&nbsp;

�Hey,� she said, �I�ve just thought � when
Harry met Larry!�

&nbsp;

�We�ve heard it,� I said. �Have a nice
evening and don�t let this guy tie you up in knots. He�s a hard task master.� 

&nbsp;

Harry gave me a warning look but Sarah
simply smiled. �Oh, I think I�ll be all right,� she said. �Bye for now.�

&nbsp;

I waited until the office door closed
before allowing myself a chuckle. �Fifty feet of rope
and two reels of duct tape?� I laughed. �She�s really going to get it isn�t
she?�

&nbsp;

�I very much think so,� said Harry, �but
you don�t grudge me a little amusement, I�m sure.
Anyway, come out to the Red Bull, you can drive one of the cars back.�

&nbsp;

We took some time discussing a few of the
ideas that I would need Harry to pick up on for the plans I had agreed with
Clegg. By the time we were through it was already gone seven and dark so we
headed off to Harry�s car and drove out of town. The Warwick Road
wasn�t the best part of the area and as we got to the pub I could see that it
wasn�t open. I didn�t think it would be, the �For
Sale� sign outside the front gave me a clue. As we pulled into the unlit, pot
holed, car park I could see that Sarah was already there chatting animatedly to
a man standing beside a white van. There was another girl with her. �Oh great,�
said Harry, with heavy irony, �she�s brought a friend.� We pulled up between
her car and the van. She waved as she saw us getting out.

&nbsp;

�Yoo hoo,� she called and then added redundantly. �Over here!�
We wandered across. �This is Julia,� said Sarah introducing her companion. I
watched Harry giving her the once over, evidently approving the girls rather
full figure and long blonde hair. He had a slightly puzzled look, I guessed he was
trying to work how she could wear a skirt that was as short and tight as the
one she had on and still manage to move.

&nbsp;

�Hello, Julia,� he said, smiling.

&nbsp;

�Jules,� she said, �call me Jules.�

&nbsp;

�OK,� said Harry, �Jules it is.�

&nbsp;

�We�ve already met your friend here. Your
business associates seem such nice people. We were just discussing where we
might go on to � I don�t think we�ll get a drink here. I know some good clubs.�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� cut in Jules, �we were going on too
a club anyway after this to celebrate Sarah�s new job, why don�t you all come?�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� said Sarah. �We could all go have
some fun. You boys look like you could use a night out � I�m a great dancer,
you should see me.�

&nbsp;

�Well,� said Harry, �I�m sure you�re right
about not getting a drink here. I don�t reckon Larry here could keep up with
you on the dance floor but I�m sure we�d all like to see you strut
your stuff. Mind you it won�t do if you�re late in tomorrow.�

&nbsp;

�Oh goodness, you can�t imagine I�d be late
in on my first day,� said Sarah.

&nbsp;

�You needn�t worry about Sarah,� said
Jules, �she�s so eager to please she�d come hopping in with a broken leg if she
thought not being there would upset anyone.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, don�t exaggerate!� exclaimed Sarah.
�But I will be there and on time.�

&nbsp;

�I� sure you will,� said Harry. �Oh, by the
way, were you able to get those things?�

&nbsp;

�He hasn�t got you shopping for him
already, has he?� said Jules. 

&nbsp;

�Shh,� said
Sarah. �I don�t mind. I like to help out.� She turned back to Harry. �Yes, no
problem. The girl at the check out gave me ever such a funny look, though, I can�t imagine what she thought I wanted them for.
They�re in the back of my car.� She passed her keys to Harry.

&nbsp;

�I�ll get them,� he said and walked across
to the car.

&nbsp;

�What on earth did he have you get?� said
Jules.

&nbsp;

Harry got back from the car. �Just a few
things from the DIY shop,� he said. �Some rope, duct tape and sacking.�

&nbsp;

�Ooh,� said Jules,
�sounds kinky to me! Who were you planning a bondage session with?�

&nbsp;

�Well,� said Harry joining in with Julia�s
giggles. �It was to have been Sarah but now I�ve got a choice.�

&nbsp;

�Not me,� said Jules, �I make it a rule not
to get tied up on a first date. Doesn�t give you a chance to
get to know one another. Mind you if you�re persuasive enough there�s
quite a lot I will do.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, Julia!� Sarah complained. �Don�t talk like that, I�ve got to work with
these guys, you know. What will Harry think?�

&nbsp;

Sarah turned towards Harry�s friend, saying
that Julia wasn�t really like this, usually. The two girls were still talking
animatedly about the clubs they thought we all might visit as Harry nodded to
his colleague. 

&nbsp;

It was almost like watching a ballet. Harry
tossed a sack over the girls� heads to his friend. Both girls watched,puzzled, as he caught it.
Sarah had her back to Harry as he pulled his sack down over her head. Jules
went to run to her aid as Harry�s friend did the self same thing to her. It was
instructive to see two experts at work. As the sack came down each man grabbed
his captive around the arms and then took a took a
length of rope, knotting it across the girl�s mouth over the sack, pulling the
Hessian into her mouth and gagging her.

&nbsp;

The two girls, struggling and kicking now and
yelping into their rope gags, were wrestled to the floor. Harry tossed one of
the rolls of tape to the other man. He used it to strap Jules�s wrists while
Harry was winding rope around Sarah�s waist and chest. Soon both girls were
trussed up with sacking over their torsos and tape wrapped around them at the
ankles and the knees. In a matter of seconds, Sarah and Jules were both laying
on the floor of the white van, squirming and mmphing
in protest. I had a good view of both girls� legs - skirts that short aren�t
really the best thing to get kidnapped in. 

&nbsp;

We slammed the door on the back of the van.
Harry took his car, I took Sarah�s. We followed the van back to the Prep
Centre. I watched as the doors of the van were opened. Both girls still had the
sacks still tied over their heads, Sarah was sitting
up, almost as if she was waiting to be helped out. Jules had been putting up
more of a fight, with only her short skirt her wriggling on the floor of the
van had left her with laddered and torn tights. She�d even managed to break the
heel of one of her shoes - as she was pulled form the van she was hobbling on
one high heel. 

&nbsp;

I took Sarah�s car around the back. The
motor pool supervisor looked at it sniffily, declared
it not worth changing the chassis and engine numbers on and put it on to the transporter that would take it over to the crusher later 

&nbsp;

When I saw Sarah again she was in one of
the holding cells. Harry
was already there. Sarah was sitting on a solid wooden chair in the middle of
the cell. They�d taken the sacking off or her head and replaced the rope gag
with a ball strapped tightly into her mouth. It didn�t stop her making a noise
but it certainly made it difficult to understand what she was saying.

&nbsp;

�GNNASKAART!�
she grunted at me� which I took to be a commentary on my parentage. She was
obviously pretty angry and they hadn�t really started on her yet. They�d put
her in handcuffs which must have been better than the ropes around her wrists.
She had shackles on her ankles and a short length of chain between them but as
long as she wasn�t trying to walk around that wasn�t really a problem.

&nbsp;

�ECCHT EE O,
ECCHT EE O!!!� she groaned, shaking herself on the chair in some attempt to
loosen the cuffs. The strap of her gag had gone over the top of her red hair,
one lock of hair hung down loose across her face; shaking her head did nothing
to stop it brushing across her nose. She gave a frustrated snort, as drips of
drool fell from the corner of her mouth. 

&nbsp;

�What do you
think, Larry?� Harry asked. They�d left her skirt, shoes and tights on but
Harry had taken her green top off to get a better view. �I think what sold her
to me was her legs but these tits are quite nice too, not big but nice. That
and the fact that she�s obviously looked after herself;
quite a fit looking girl really.� 

&nbsp;

�I think
she�ll make a very decorative addition to your office. Unless
you are planning to take her friend instead?� 

&nbsp;

Sarah
glowered at me. �GAARHGH!!� she grunted.

&nbsp;

�Sounds like
something out of �My Fair Lady�,� I laughed. 

&nbsp;

�Fair
indeed,� said Harry pulling a knife from his pocket. Sarah tried to shrink away
staring in fright at the knife as he advanced towards her. He sliced though her
bra straps and then through the strip of cloth between the cups, pulling the
bra from her and letting her breasts fall free. Sarah wriggled and tried to
pull away but then glowered at Harry as she saw the amusement her bobbling
breasts caused.

&nbsp;

My only disappointment was that I didn�t
have time to see what happened next to Harry�s new recruits.

Chapter 13: The Kalinin of Kushtia

&nbsp;

As far as trying out the account management
idea was concerned, Clegg was as good as his word. He set up a meeting for me
only a few days later.

&nbsp;

�So, I understand from Mr Clegg, that your
new approach is to meet the specific needs of your clients rather than just
picking up whatever you find lying around.� The robed man in my office had an
Asiatic appearance but spoke English without any trace of an accent. Clegg had
said he was the Kalinin of Kushtia an old school friend, though he didn�t say
from what school.

&nbsp;

�You sound sceptical, your highness,� I
responded. �I�m sure it was never Mr Clegg�s approach to simply collect stock
on an ad-hoc basis but, yes, we are interested in developing the way we do
business.�� 

&nbsp;

He shrugged. �We shall see. I have a
problem. Mr Clegg tells me he can solve it. He has always managed to meet his
commitments in the past.�

&nbsp;

I was standing. He was seated. I�ve never
been much of a fan of royalty but when they�re the customer they get all the politeness
they want as far as I�m concerned. Mind you if someone had asked me who (or
even what) the Kalinin of Kushtia was, I couldn�t have told them. Couldn�t have
told them where Kushtia was, either. It turns out Kushtia is a narrow strip of
a country that runs along the northern edge of the Hindu Kush. The Kalinin is the
hereditary ruler.

&nbsp;

The Kalinin went on.
�Let me tell you my problem,� he said. �It is conventional in my country when a
prince comes of age that his father provides him with the pick of the women of
the village to become the start of his harem. Naturally we wish to continue the
tradition even though we are here in your country, in exile.�

&nbsp;

�Naturally,� I replied.

&nbsp;

�But here in the west there is little
understanding of our customs. I fear that our traditions are not accepted. The
ways of our culture are not always honoured here. I believe that I must
exercise some care in the way that these things are handled.�

&nbsp;

�I am sure you are right.�

&nbsp;

�So, we wish you to arrange this. Mr Clegg
tells me that your goal is to meet your customer�s needs. My son has made a
list of those women he desires. I wish to satisfy him as far as is possible.
Perhaps I could have your views?�

�

I looked at the list he was holding out to
me.

&nbsp;


 Girls Aloud (especially : Nicola)
 The Spice Girls (especially : Geri)
 The Pussy Cat Dolls (especially : Carmit) 
 Nicole Kidman
 Lindsay Lohan


&nbsp;

�I think I�m beginning to detect a trend
here�.� I said, noting the enthusiasm for pop singers and for redheads. I
wondered what he would think if he ever chanced on Sarah, Harry�s PA.

&nbsp;


 The Sugababes
 Destiny�s Child


&nbsp;

�Oh, OK, not quite single minded. Look,
your highness, I think that, even with our resources, we are going to have to
reset some expectations.�

&nbsp;


 Hooters waitress
 NFL Cheerleader 


&nbsp;

�How old is your son?� I asked noting that
at least the last two might be achievable.

&nbsp;

�Twenty five, that is the age for the taking
of wives,� his father replied. He saw my raised eyebrows. �But in some ways he
seems much younger. Even so, you do understand � this is the tradition � that
he should have the best that is available; that his father should provide the
best for his son�s harem women. That, after all, reflects on me.�

&nbsp;

�Of course your highness but I am sure that
you see what a challenge this list is. If we were to succeed in acquiring some
of these then I fear that a great deal of unwelcome attention might be
attracted. If it were to ever be traced back to yourselves then it could do
make it difficult for you to remain here. Our asylum laws are flexible but
there are some things that even the British Government�s Home Secretary may
take exception to.�

&nbsp;

�Indeed, we must operate with a certain discretion. However, Mr Clegg has great faith in
your ability to solve problems. I will allow you to surprise me.�� He got to his feet, smiled and swept out. It
was my first real job for Clegg and I wasn�t optimistic.

&nbsp;

I needed to talk to Research, I thought. I
really needed some ideas on how we could set about this. Then I had a bit of
luck. I was walking through Southwark past a run down pub when I heard the
strains of �Wannabe� drifting out. A chalked sign on a board beside the door
said, �Live Music � All Spice � 2nite.�

&nbsp;

I went in.

&nbsp;

It was a pretty seedy venue. I bought
myself a pint. The beer wasn�t any better than the rest of the pub but the
stage in the room at the back held five reasonably convincing look-alikes, a
Spice Girls tribute band, thrashing their way through the Girl Power
repertoire. Ginger and Posh were the closest to the real thing for looks, which
suited me. They probably sang better than the originals had. The rest of the
pub�s clientele didn�t seem to be taking much notice. 

&nbsp;

One guy was sitting on a pile of cases that
had evidently held their kit. He looked as if he might have something to do
with them.� I walked over to him. �I�d
like to talk to the band,� I said.

&nbsp;

He didn�t look interested. �Yeah � you and
all the jack-off johnnies.�

&nbsp;

�No, seriously, I might have a gig for
them.�

&nbsp;

He looked bored, unconvinced. �Maybe I
could get you a chat with �Victoria�. Only problem is she talks to blokes on a professional basis.�

&nbsp;

�Huh?�

&nbsp;

He tossed a small, pink, card across the
table to me. Under a picture of a high heeled shoe and a pair of crossed whips
the lettering said, �Spice up your life with Mistress Posh�. There was a mobile
phone number. �Not really my scene,� I said.

&nbsp;

�Please yourself,�
he said. 

&nbsp;

The girls finished their set
with �2 become 1�. I could see the band starting to pack up. The girls
were getting ready to go. �Hang on,� I said, slipping a ten pound note in his
hand. �Put in a good word for me can you?� 

&nbsp;

He peered at the note but then stuffed it
in his pocket. �Wait,� he said. �No promises.� He headed off to the back of the
stage.

&nbsp;

She emerged a few minutes later. She�d
changed out of her stage costume; now she was just wearing a pair of jeans and
a sweater. The likeness was still striking, even close up; slim build, and short,
dark, urchin-bobbed, hair. She was pretty good at the trademark Victoria scowl,
too. She tossed a carpet bag onto the table between us and sat down directly
opposite me. She didn�t say anything at first. She just pulled a soft packet of
cigarettes from her bag, tapped one out and lit it. She inhaled, let a stream
of smoke out in the general direction of the pub�s grimy ceiling and then
looked towards me. �Here�s the deal,� she said. �No water sports, no medical
play, no penetrative sex or flesh on flesh of any kind and neither you nor I
end up in an England soccer shirt. We use my hotel not yours and it�s all cash up front.
Right?�

&nbsp;

�I was thinking of something a bit more
specialised,� I said, slowly in repsonse. �How about if you bring the girls
round and you all sing for me?�

&nbsp;

�Wow,� she said, �a real pervert! Were we
really that bad?� She allowed herself an out-of-character smile as she stubbed
her cigarette out. �He said,� she nodded towards the bar where my
ten-pound-richer companion was leaning, �you were looking for a date.�

&nbsp;

I nodded. �Yeah, sort of.
But not with Mistress P. I meant it about getting the
band round for a gig. I know a couple of guys who might be able to get you some
bookings. Better than this. Not great - but better than this.�

&nbsp;

�What sort of thing?�

&nbsp;

�Clubs rather than pubs. Maybe some cruise work. We�re not talking X-Factor fame and fortune
but it would be more than you�re making from this, I�ll bet.�

&nbsp;

�So, what if we wanted to?� She tossed the
pack of cigarettes back into her bag.

&nbsp;

�I get a venue; you bring the girls; you
audition; I talk to my friends; we see what happens.�

&nbsp;

�As �All Spice� or as
ourselves?�

&nbsp;

�Let�s do it as �All Spice� for a start,� I
could see she was disappointed. �Stick a couple of tracks on of your own at the
end if you want to take the risk.� She perked up at the idea. �Will the rest of
the girls want to do it?�

&nbsp;

�Oh sure,� she said. She picked up the pink
card and scribbled a mobile phone number on it. �They�ll do it if I say so.
It�s not just blokes that I get off on getting my own way with. If it helps, I
could maybe give you a freebie.�

&nbsp;

�Thanks, but it�s not my thing. I�d just
like to set up an audition.� 

&nbsp;

She looked at me with a raised eyebrow. �Really? Please yourself. I�ve got plenty of clients that
tell me I�m pretty good. I�d hate to miss an opportunity to convince you of the
benefits of booking the band.� She smiled. I shrugged. She tossed the card back
to me. �Give me a call on that number when you�ve got a time and place.� 

&nbsp;

�Geri� called across from by the pub�s
door. �Are you coming?� she said. I took a good look at her as �Victoria� grabbed
her bag and headed towards her. I thought that the Kalinin�s son would
be happy enough with her as well, just as long as he didn�t let her get on top.
And I was having some ideas about the other redheads too.

Chapter 14: I Spice With My
Little Eyes

&nbsp;

I�d arranged to meet up with the Kalinin and his son in the conference room at the Prep
Centre. I got there a little early and bumped into Harry as I walked in. �How�s
your new PA,� I asked. �Has she worked out what�s going on yet?�

&nbsp;

�Oh, I think so,� said Harry. �In fact I
was just about to pop in to see her, if you wanted to have a look.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, sure,� I said, �I�ve got a while and
I haven�t really seen too much of the Prep Centre side of things.�

&nbsp;

�She�s in here,� said Harry unlocking a
door.

&nbsp;

Sarah was curled up on the floor in one
corner of the cell, chained by her neck collar to a ring in the wall. She
looked up with a scowl as we came in.

&nbsp;

�She seems to have lost some of her sunny
disposition,� I said.

&nbsp;

�I don�t want to see you. Go away. I�ve got
nothing to say. Leave me alone why don�t you?� Sarah
said.

&nbsp;

Harry looked disappointed. He unlocked a
small cabinet to one side of the room. I saw it contained an array of straps,
chains, and flogger. Harry took a ball gag from the cabinet and advanced on
Sarah with it. �This conversation is going to be a little one sided, I�d like
you to listen and not interrupt,�

&nbsp;

�I won�t be gagged, I won�t, I won�t,� she
shook her head as Harry went towards her. He ignored her objections and grabbed
a hank of her red hair and twisted. As she yelped in pain he pushed the ball in
place, jerked the strap tight and clicked the locking catch shut. He let go her
hair and she sank back down on her heels, reaching up to tug ineffectually at the
strap that held the gag in place. She gave a muffled groan of frustration.

&nbsp;

�There,� said Harry. �Now perhaps you�ll
listen. You�ve had an easy ride of it here, so far.� A muffled grunt of
disbelief answered him. �Because you aren�t being sold, or at least you�re not
being sold yet, you�ve not been raped and you�ve barely been beaten except when
you�ve been particularly difficult. All that is because I am
keen for you to take up the role for which I originally interviewed you.
Now it seems to me you have a choice at this point. Either you can accept my
job offer,� Sarah grunted and shook her head. �As I was saying, either you can
accept my job offer or we can put you into the pool of girls for resale.� This
time she shook her head vigorously. �I can offer you a situation in which you
will remain here and be treated well. I am sure you can imagine how it will be
if you are sold � I cannot be responsible for where you will end up and to what
use you might be put. I am sure that your talent for dancing will attract a
certain sort of buyer but apart from that who knows.� Sarah gave a whimper of
despair. �Now, I�m going to give you one last chance to decide.�

&nbsp;

As he said this another girl appeared
carrying a tray containing a heap of ropes of different thicknesses. �We have a
buyer coming to our next auction who is particularly interested to acquire a
red headed slave for his collection: he�s particularly keen on elaborate
bondage and he�s asked for a few pictures of potential acquisitions. We�ll give
you a chance to show if you�re suited to this sort of thing.� He turned to the
girl with the ropes. �See what you can do with her,� he said. �She should be
fairly supple, most dancers are. Don�t hold back - I know our prospective buyer
won�t.�

&nbsp;

I left Sarah, Harry and the girl to go in
search of the Kalinin.

&nbsp;

The Kalinin and
his son were sitting on the couch in our conference room. Clegg had come in
with them as well. �I am surprised that you have solved this problem so
quickly,� the Kalinin said.

&nbsp;

�Well, your highness, I�ll wait until you
have seen what I propose before making any claim,� I replied. Clegg smiled.
�I�d like to show you a short video and then we can discuss next steps, if that
is acceptable.�

&nbsp;

�Video?� queried the Kalinin.

&nbsp;

�Yes, your highness. I wanted to make sure
we were going down the right track.�

&nbsp;

�Very well,� he answered, �continue.�

&nbsp;

I pressed the button the closed the
conference room curtains and dimmed the lights. The video projector flickered
and burst into life with the Clegg Enterprises logo. Out of the speakers came
the sound of U2�s �Even Better Than The Real Thing�� �It faded down and the video began with All
Spice hammering out �Say You�ll Be There�. Close ups of the five girls were
inter-cut with black and white photos of the real Spice Girls as they were then
and as they are now. It was interesting watching the Kalinin�s son � he�d
obviously never thought about the fact that the pictures of the chicks he�d
been beating off to were all taken seven years ago. He was definitely attracted
by the idea of All Spice who look more like what he�d
been getting off on than the girls who were in the real band do now. Plus the
All Spice �Ginger� was in her more pneumatic style which also got approval. The
U2 track faded up again. Next up was a Nicola Roberts look-alike that we found.
She�s got a pretty good voice too and if anything her hair was redder than the
real Nicola�s � least ways that�s how it looked in the video. Same went for the
�Nicole Kidman� who thought we were looking for a stand in for some advertising
work. I could see that the son was getting pretty keen. The U2 track faded
down. The video moved on to a series of short clips from some recruitment
auditions. The girls had thought we were setting up for the opening of a new Hooters in London. Each had a
girl sitting in as chair saying, �Hi, I�m Jo (or Jenny, or Marcy or whatever)
and I really want to be a Hooters Girl. Pick me, why don�t you?� Then she pulls
off her top, gives the camera a good shot of her boobs, pulls on a Hooters
t-shirt, steps out of their skirt or jeans and into a pair of the famous orange
shorts before walking up and down to show how the outfit looks on them. There
were six of them all well stacked, of course, and blondes or redheads. 

&nbsp;

By the end of it the Kalinin�s son was
practically dribbling. The Kalinin
beamed with approval at me. He turned to the distracted youth. �Well, my son,
he said. It is traditional for your father to provide the first women for your
harem. You can make your choice from those.�

&nbsp;

�Choose, father?� the son responded. �I do
not need to choose, I shall be able to satisfy them all.� I was pleased by the
son�s response, reckoning the value of an order for thirteen pickups. 

&nbsp;

His father, however, was less than happy.
�Son,� he said, a harem is like a garden. You should not plant all the beds at
once. At first it is best to begin with a plot that can be easily cultivated,
then as experience grows, it is possible to tend a larger area. I suggest that
you start with three.�

&nbsp;

�But father, your own harem in Kushtia had over fifteen wives.�

� 

�Yes, son, but that took me many years.�

&nbsp;

�But father, ..�
the son began.

&nbsp;

�I wonder if I might suggest a compromise,�
I said, concerned that the entire exercise was about to dissolve into a family
argument.

&nbsp;

The Kalinin held up his hand to silence his son. �Please do,� he said.

&nbsp;

�Perhaps if we were to proceed initially by
acquiring the group All Spice for your son. It seems
that, although they are five, they will be easily managed as they are used to
being together Because of their youth they will soon become adapted to your son
and his ways. From our side it would be very difficult to acquire less than the
entire group and it hardly seems sensible to split up the set once acquired. I
would think, also that the group provides a good selection of women as a
starting point for a harem with a range of different looks and characters. It
will provide the Prince with a good selection of types with which to develop
his skills and tastes further.�

&nbsp;

The son looked sceptical at the reduction
in his ambitions as did the father, concerned at this increase in his planned
commitment. �Five is still more than I had considered,� he said.

&nbsp;

The Prince however, evidently saw that this
was as good a deal as he was likely to get. �Oh father, please,� he said. �They
will look well together in the harem dress. The one called Posh has a haughty
look that I long to tame. Emma has a sweetness that will be so good to corrupt.
The two Melanies will be a source of constant
amusement.�

�And I think your highness,� I interjected, �that Geri will prove a satisfying
acquisition as well. As far as we can tell both the hair colour and the figure
are genuine and un-enhanced.�

&nbsp;

�You see father,� the Prince went on, �a
good investment. A good starting point for me.�

&nbsp;

The Kalinin appeared to soften. �Very well,� he said. �How can I deny my eldest
boy?� He turned to me. �It seems we are agreed on your proposal,� he said. �You
will arrange their collection?�� 

&nbsp;

�Of course, your highness,� I replied,
thinking that I�d keep the rest for another occasion.

&nbsp;

�Good,� he said. �That seems to resolve
things. I shall tell Clegg that I am pleased by your approach. I am sure we
shall do more business in future.�

&nbsp;

It had been a successful session. I went to
tell Harry that we needed to get started on the arrangements. I found him back
in Sarah�s cell. The bondage that Sarah had been put in was evidently
agonising, her gagged grunts of complaint from earlier had been replace by an
almost continuous muffled wail of pain. She was swinging suspended from the
ceiling of the cell, her elbows dragged together behind her back and her ankles
doubled up behind her back. Coarse ropes criss-crossed her tits, and pulled
across her crotch. Thin ropes stretched from each of her big toes to rings on
the wall so that the slightest swinging motion threatened to dislocate them.
The ball gag had been replaced by a gag of knotted rope that was linked back to
her elbow tie and her ankles, bending her head backwards. 

&nbsp;

Harry turned to the girl that had put Sarah
into her predicament. �Have you got all the photographs you need?�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� she said. �I think she�ll be quite
good for this if you do decide to let her go.�

&nbsp;

�Thanks,� said Harry. �we�ll
have to see if she�s decided that this is her sort of thing or not. Now,
Sarah.� She gave a groan of despair. He picked a cane from the toy cupboard and
ran it along her thigh. �Now, it seems to me you have a simple choice. Come and
do the job I asked you to do or take the chance of something like this.� Another,
more pleading, groan came from the suspended girl. �Would you like this to
stop?� A slight nod of the head set her swinging, the cords pulling at her
toes, causing another squeal of pain. �Good,� said Harry. �I can make it stop
if you�re ready to do as I ask. Can I assume you are?� Another
nod, another squeal of pain. �Excellent, I am pleased. You know what
they say - one volunteer is worth ten pressed men.� Harry turned to the girl.
�Cut her down,� he said. The girl looked disappointed. �There will be plenty of
others don�t worry and this one will be back if she doesn�t continue to
comply.�

&nbsp;

Sarah was lowered to the ground slowly, the
ropes removed from her toes, elbows and ankles. The knotted rope gag was
removed, leaving the corners of her mouth sore and bleeding. She curled up in a
sobbing heap at Harry�s feet.

&nbsp;

�Now,� Harry said to the girl. �You can
start earning your way out of here. Keep on being obedient and you can earn
some clothes, when you�re fully dressed you can start work. You�ll be out of
the cells and you�ll only have me to answer to. Do you understand?� Sarah
nodded. �Every time one of the guards thinks you�re not being obedient enough
you�ll be stripped naked and have to start again. Understand?� Another nod. �It�s up to you how long it takes.� He turned
to the girl that had trussed Sarah so viciously. He passed her the cane �Give
her twenty stokes with this every evening that she remains in here,� he said.
Sara whimpered. �But give her some stockings and a garter belt. I thinks she�s earned those this afternoon.�

&nbsp;

Harry smiled as we left the cell. �I think
she�ll come around to my way of seeing things,� he said. �Now, what do you want
to set up for the Kalinin.

&nbsp;

We talked through my ideas about All Spice
and then Harry suggested we went down to the canteen for some lunch.

&nbsp;

It was pretty crowded by the time we got
there but we managed to find a table. We�d been there about five minutes when
two heavily built men in the uniform black tee-shirts that all the guards wore
wandered up. 

&nbsp;

�Mind if we join you?� the taller of the
two said.

&nbsp;

�Sure,� said Harry. �There�s not much space
in here today.�

&nbsp;

�Can�t think why,� said the other, �when
you look at what they�re serving. Harry, you really ought to try and pick up
someone that can cook for in here.�

&nbsp;

Harry grinned and prodded his lunch with
his fork. �It�s a thought,� he said.

&nbsp;

The first man said, �Hey, you two guys
picked up the busty blonde piece that was snatched with the redhead, didn�t
you? You�re going to love this.�

&nbsp;

�Uhhuh, what was
her name, Julia � Jules,� said Harry, �Is she giving
you some grief?�

&nbsp;

�Nah. She�s in the block I�m looking after and she�s been average
cooperative up until now. This morning she starts coming on to me, when I take
her gag off. �Why don�t I be nice to you,� she goes. �Sure you could fuck me,
like you get to fuck all the girls but wouldn�t it be nice to have some fun
where I�m joining in?� And she�s pushing her tits at me and licking her lips.�

&nbsp;

�Even Jack here got the point,� his friend
said.

&nbsp;

�Well I think her idea sounds like fun, I
mean when you get to rape women anytime you choose you think maybe there�s
something a bit kinky about her joining in, you know. She says that it�s part of a deal, she�ll give me a real good time if I
help her get out. I think the first bit sounds good - let�s worry about the
second bit after. She turns out to be rather a good screw. Very bouncy, if you
know what I mean, given the limits of those beds in the cells.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, Harry, can you do anything about
that?�

&nbsp;

�Not my area, really,� said Harry, �I don�t
run the Prep Centre, better talk to Rick.� He took another mouthful of food. �So then what?�

&nbsp;

�Well she says how are we going to organise
the escape? I tell her we�ll use one of the transport trunks. I get it down
from despatch and bring it into the cell, tell her to hide inside it.�

&nbsp;

�And strap her in because of course she
might bounce around otherwise,� Jack�s pal interrupts with a grin.

&nbsp;

�Then I tell her that I�m going to smuggle
her out but it will take a while and she�s got to be real quiet. I shut the
trunk and left her for about half an hour then wheeled it around the Prep
Centre a couple of times, put her on a truck and drove her around the site for
a while. She�s in the trunk on the truck in the delivery bay right now.�

&nbsp;

�Ain�t that a gas! She�s going to be spitting pins when we get her out of
that trunk,� Jack�s friend laughed.

&nbsp;

�This I want to see,� said Harry. �How about you, Larry?�

&nbsp;

I nodded. We all finished up our lunch and
Jack led the way down to the delivery bay. Jules�s case was sitting there just
as he�d said. He leant down beside it and said quietly, �Hey babe, we�re here.
Not far now.� There was a squeak from inside the trunk as he pulled it back on
its wheels and pushed it towards the cell that Julia had left only a couple of
hours before.

&nbsp;

With the trunk back in
Julia�s cell. Jack bent down again beside it.
�How you doing babe?� he asked.

&nbsp;

�I�m real stiff,� she called out from
inside the trunk. �These straps are too tight and I can�t move at all in here.
Are we there yet?�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, sure,� said Jack, �hang on, I�ll
open the trunk.� He laid it down so that Julia was on her back, bringing
another squeal from inside the trunk. He fumbled noisily with the locks on the
lid. As he lifted it open, Julia realised that she and Jack were not alone.

&nbsp;

�Hello,� said Harry. �I really don�t think
you should be trying this sort of thing.�

&nbsp;

Julia was struggling against her straps and
suggesting that Jack was in the business of having carnal knowledge of his
maternal parent.

&nbsp;

Harry went on, �You�ve really got to get
used to the idea� � he picked up the dog tag she wore attached to her collar �
�06/085, that you�ll get on better here if you do as we wish. Now since you
were so keen to get into that trunk you can stay there for a couple of days.
Spend a bit of time thinking about things. You�re not going to get away. I
think you�d be better off coming to terms with that.�����

Chapter 15: Spice Racked

&nbsp;

About a week later I needed to check the
final arrangements for the All Spice collection with Harry. When I called him,
Sarah answered. I guess I shouldn�t have been surprised but I hadn�t realised
that she would be out of orientation that quickly. She set up the meeting
efficiently. I could see that Harry hadn�t only been interested in her for her
physical attributes.

&nbsp;

When I got to Harry�s office, I saw Sarah
for the first time since she�d been cowering at Harry�s feet after being
released from an extreme bondage session. She had evidently come through her
orientation without her cheery approach being affected. She looked up from
filing her nails as I walked in. �Good morning Mr Ross,� she said with a smile
as I walked in �He won�t keep you a moment, please take a seat.� 

&nbsp;

I did so. Sarah went back to her manicure.
Harry obviously favoured a traditional look around the office. Sarah was still
wearing her wavy red hair loose. She had on a white high necked blouse but I
could see the line of her slave collar beneath it. Harry obviously had her
wearing a padded bra, she�d certainly filled out since I�d last seen her and
there hadn�t been time for surgery � I guessed Harry had that planned in her
future. I still really didn�t understand what they did in Orientation but Sarah
certainly seemed to have been trained quite quickly and she seemed as willing
to please now as she had been when I�d seen her at interview.

&nbsp;

�Can I get you a coffee or something Mr
Ross?� she asked brightly.

&nbsp;

�No, I�m fine,� I said. �How are you
settling in?�

&nbsp;

�Oh, OK,� she said. �I mean I know I was a
bit silly at the interview and everything. Well, how stupid can someone be?
Going off and buying the things their kidnapper needs to kidnap them!�

&nbsp;

�Harry�s very plausible,� I said
sympathetically.

&nbsp;

�I know. I felt bad about it at first but
then I got to see some of the snatch reports from the teams and there are
plenty of brighter people than me get trapped in fairly silly ways. Lawyers,
doctors, all sorts. And I mean actually it�s quite a good job. I know he just
wanted to pick someone up and I can�t say I enjoyed the kidnapping bit and all
the training and the rest but actually the job is all right. And Harry really
needs someone to help him keep the office in order � there�s so much to do
around here. Do you think I�m doing all right?�

&nbsp;

�I�m sure you�re doing fine,� I said.
�Harry would soon let you know if you weren�t.�

&nbsp;

�Well, I like to do a good job, even if he
did grab me like some piece of meat.�

&nbsp;

A buzzer went off on Sarah�s desk and she
got to her feet. As she came around the end of the desk I saw that at least
Harry hadn�t changed her taste in skirts � if anything the navy blue skirt she
was wearing was shorter and tighter than the one I had seen barely covering her
backside as she struggled in the back of the van � and the heels she was
wearing were higher than you�d usually expect in any normal office. She turned
to open Harry�s office door, giving me a glimpse of stocking through the short
slit at the back of her skirt. The day was getting better by the minute.

&nbsp;

Harry got up from behind his desk and waved
me in. �Thank you, Sarah,� he said. �Come on in Larry.� The day carried on
getting better, Tricia was in his office too. She gave me a welcoming, �Hi�.

&nbsp;

Sarah showed me through the door. �Can I
get anything?� she asked.

&nbsp;

�Now,� joked Harry, �the last time you
asked Larry and me that, I seem to remember you ended up going shopping for
ropes and tape.�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� said Sarah, good humouredly, �and I
never got my expenses paid either.�

&nbsp;

�Ah,� said Harry, �where were the receipts?
Can�t pay out expenses without receipts. Ask any of the team.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, well,� giggled Sarah, �It could have
been worse. You might have wanted handcuffs, a ball gag and a hood from a
fetish shop. I�d have probably got those too.� 

&nbsp;

Harry smiled and waved her out. Turning
back to me he said, �I asked Tricia to join us. You said you wanted to set
these girls up in a recording studio? Tricia used to do a bit of studio work.
She can drive a desk; give it all a bit of authenticity.�

&nbsp;

�Great,� I said. �It�ll be fun. Have you
done much operational stuff since our little burglary outing?�

&nbsp;

�Oh sure,� she said, �Harry doesn�t let you
sit around once you�ve shown you can do it. This one looks a bit different
though.�

&nbsp;

�Well, I guess so,� I said. �Let me fill
you in on the plan��

&nbsp;

I�d just about got to the end of it when
Clegg put his head around the door. Tricia seemed to sense that Freddie wanted
a private chat, got up and excused herself to go. Freddie didn�t stop her. 

&nbsp;

�That your new secretary?� Freddie asked,
nodding towards the door. �Very nice girl. Bubbly personality. And that hair
colour looks real too.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah,� said Harry. �She was a find.� 

&nbsp;

Freddie barely paused. �Oh, by the way
Harry, she�ll have to go, you know.�

&nbsp;

�What?� said Harry. �She�s only just
started.�

&nbsp;

�Come on if you�re in the meat products
business you can�t keep the prime cuts for yourself. With legs like that and
that red hair you know we�ll get a terrific price. And Brian�s numbers don�t
look too good this month � he needs something to boost his margins and he�s got
some Balkan buyers in the auction in a couple of weeks, they just love
redheads. She needs to go in the sale with the other one you picked up at the
same time.�

&nbsp;

Harry tried to protest, saying that Sarah
had only just finished her training and she�d not really been broken properly
for re-sale. Freddie was adamant. �Sorry, Harry, if you want to recruit a PA
you�d better find something that�s not so saleable or get Brian to fix his
revenue stream� he said. �Call her in and tell her. I�ll do it if you�re not
happy with it.�

&nbsp;

Harry looked glum but gave in. �OK,
Freddie, I�ll do it to help out the numbers, but Brian needs to lift his game.�
He reached across and pressed the intercom buzzer. �Sarah, in here, please,
now.�

&nbsp;

Sarah appeared at the door of the office
and seemed to sense at once that all was not well. �Is there a problem,� she
said. �Have I done something wrong?�

&nbsp;

�No, it�s nothing you�ve done Sarah.
However, you know how it is with slaves, we buy and sell them. I�ve been
discussing your future with Mr Clegg here and we�ve agreed that the best option
for you is to put you on sale at one of our next auctions.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, but, don�t you need someone to go on
doing the work I�m doing now? I mean I know I haven�t fully got to grips with
all of it yet but I thought I was doing everything you wanted.�

&nbsp;

�It�s all right, Sarah, you�ve been doing
fine,� Harry was reassuring. �It�s just that we�ve had a change of plans.�

&nbsp;

�I�ll take her back to the orientation area
to finish her training,� said Freddie. �You�d better come with me, Sarah.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, all right,� said Sarah. �She held out
her arms. �Don�t you want to chain my wrists?� she asked. �They always kept me
chained up when I was down there before. And gagged. I had to wear a gag. Is
there one in here? I could get a scarf or something if you wanted.�

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry, Sarah,� said Harry gently.
�They�ll sort you out when you get down there.�

&nbsp;

�Well, I don�t want to be any trouble,� she
said.

&nbsp;

Harry and I watched as Freddie led Sarah
away.

&nbsp;

�Bugger,� said Harry. �She was shaping up
nicely.�

&nbsp;

�I tell you what, Harry, I might be able to
do you a favour. I going to need someone to do some work on a video I�m
organising. I�ll try and get Sarah assigned to it. If Clegg agrees then maybe
she�ll miss this sale and you can get another go at putting her back in the
office if Brian�s numbers pick up. I reckon I owe you a favour.�

&nbsp;

�That would be a help, Larry,� Harry said.
�Do what you can.�

&nbsp;

I wasn�t sure how I would persuade Freddie
but that could come later. �How did Jules shape up?� I asked, changing the
subject. 

&nbsp;

Larry had still looked glum but he
brightened up at a little. �Well, she does seem to be seeing sense now. No more
crazy escape attempts at any rate � she could hardly move for a day after we
got her out of the trunk. Two days in one of those without the relaxants aren�t
anyone�s idea of fun. I think she knows she�s not going to escape and that
there�s no knight in shining armour going to come galloping over the hill. Jack
said she was asking what she needed to do to get best billing at the auction
next week. She even spent time trying to persuade Brian to spice up her entry
in the sale catalogue. Brian was pretty pleased; he doesn�t get the stock
coming on to him too often. And she really did seem to do all she could to
promote her very considerable assets. Brian seems to think she might help the
numbers too.�� 

&nbsp;

�Interesting,� I said. �Brian obviously
needs something to help things out. Still, I�d better get on with our little
project.� I punched �Victoria�s� number into my mobile. Her answer phone cut in; �Hi, I�m not
around right now but if you leave the usual details I�ll get back to you.�

&nbsp;

The phone bleeped, I spoke in response,
�Hi, Vicky, it�s Larry. Just to let you know my client liked your audition
tape. Can you give me a call?�

&nbsp;

It was only about five minutes later that
she called back. �Hi,� she said, �sorry I missed your call. I was a bit busy.�

&nbsp;

�All Spice work or Mistress P work?� I
asked.

&nbsp;

I heard her giggle. �The latter,� she said.
There was a pause. �Hang on.� She�d obviously put her hand over the microphone,
her voice sounded muffled but I could still hear her. �Back on your knees, you!�
she barked, �I didn�t say you could get up.��
She came back to the phone. �Sorry about that,� she said. 

&nbsp;

�That�s OK,� I replied, �I guess it�s not
very convenient right now.�

&nbsp;

�No that�s fine. You said your client liked
the tape.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, he�s really keen. He�d just like to
hear a couple of extra tracks of your own stuff.�

&nbsp;

�Wow, that�s great!�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, can you get the girls back together?
I�ve got another studio we can use. And can you all wear your stage costumes?
I�d like to get a few publicity shots at the same time.�

&nbsp;

�Absolutely!� Vicky was evidently pleased.
�Where�s the studio?�

&nbsp;

I gave her the details of a converted
warehouse in the East End and a time for them all to turn up the following day. Harry�s team
didn�t need much time to get things set up and all was ready as I greeted Vicky
and the others outside the studio that afternoon.

&nbsp;

They�d gone to town on their costumes: all
of them were in different black outfits. �I like the look,� I said welcoming
the girls. �Cover of Rolling Stone, July �97, unless I�m mistaken.�

&nbsp;

�Wow, you are a fan,� Posh said. �What do
you think?�

&nbsp;

What I said was, �Like I said, I like the
look.� What I thought was; it was going to be a close call which of them the
Kalinin�s son found sexier; �Emma� in her short skirt and basque, �Scary� in
leather bra and trousers, �Posh� in her short, slit skirt and bikini top; not
to mention the outfits that Geri and Sporty were wearing. I guessed that
Ginger�s hair would take priority, though. 

&nbsp;

�Sporty� handed over a bag of mini-disks.
�Backing tracks,� she said, �your engineer will want them. Let�s get started.�

&nbsp;

I was as keen as the girls. Tricia and
another of Harry�s snatch team were with me in the control room. All Spice
piled into the small studio booth. They pulled on headphones and plugged
themselves in. �Emma� called across to us, �We�ll do the track on the green
disk first if that�s OK.�

&nbsp;

Tricia held up the disk, �Emma� nodded and she
plugged it into the console. A thumping bass line spilled out of the monitors.
She leant forward, hit stop and the music died away. �I�ll cue that for you,� she
said, �three � two � one.� The music started again and the girls joined in.
Emma started a solo part, with the two Mel�s backing her up.

&nbsp;

They were sounding as good as they looked.
It was almost a shame to hit the button that fired the gas canister.

&nbsp;

As they reached the chorus the gas began to
seep into the booth. Emma, stretching for the high notes sucked it in quickly.
She gave a puzzled look and slid slowly to her knees. Ginger and Sporty went
forward to catch her and caught the gas too, following her to the floor of the
booth. Scary and Victoria spun around and tried to open the door of the booth but found it
locked. They started to hammer on the glass, coughing and choking as they took
in the gas, clawing at the glass of the booth in an attempt to escape. Moments
later they succumbed as the others had and slid to the floor

&nbsp;

We gave it a few moments for the gas to
disperse. As we opened the door to the recording booth, the unconscious form of
Vicky slumped through it, down onto the floor of the studio, lying face up with
a frozen, startled look on her face, her headphones clutched in her hand. The
snatch team went to work quickly, taping the girl�s wrists and ankles, gagging
them and blindfolding them too. Each of them was folded up into their own
personal transport box. Emma and Vicky the two smallest into double bass cases;
the others into boxes that looked from the outside like music amps. �We�ll get
them back to the Prep Centre and see if they go up to 11,� said Harry�s man with
a laugh as he and Tricia wheeled them out to the truck waiting outside.

&nbsp;

�See you around,� said Tricia with a smile
and a wave.

Chapter 16: A Call From The Kalinin

&nbsp;

I was up in the Sales Centre watching
another auction. Some of the women that had taken longer in orientation were
now ready for market. Brian was convinced that prices were starting to rise. I
still wasn�t convinced. I looked around the room; it didn�t look like there
were too many buyers to me. 

&nbsp;

I saw that the first lot onto the platform
was to be Julia. I�d seen her, after she�d got over the punishments for her
escape attempt, being trained to play her part in the auction. Brian was
evidently keen to show that he could drive up the prices by getting the girls
to pitch themselves better. This time he�d set up a
big video projection screen at the back of the stage.

&nbsp;

I watched from the side of the platform as
she came on stage, teetering in high heels, bottom swaying in a very short
tight skirt and her ample tits straining to burst out of a crisply starched
white blouse. With a brown manila folder in her hand, her long hair pulled
tight back from her face into a pony tail and a pair of glasses perched on her
nose she looked the archetypal secretary. 

&nbsp;

A murmur ran around the buyers. It was as
much, I thought, surprise at the fact that, while she wore the collar that
marked her out as sale stock, she was neither shackled nor gagged. I guess it
could have been appreciation.

&nbsp;

�Welcome lot number 06/086,� Brian said in
an oily tone. �I understand that you wish to apply for the job of personal
secretary to one of our audience today. I see that you�ve brought you
application folder.�

&nbsp;

�That�s right, Sir,� Julia responded. �I�d
make a very good, very personal, secretary.�

&nbsp;

�Well, please take a seat. And face the
camera, won�t you? I�d like everyone to be able to see exactly what you have to
offer.�

&nbsp;

Julia sat herself down on a high stool in
the centre of the stage. The screen flickered into life and her face was
projected up on it. The image was six feet high or more, you could almost see
the individual grains of mascara on her eye lashes as she batted them at the
camera. She crossed her legs and then gave a giggle as she tugged ineffectually
at the hem of her skirt in an attempt to keep it some sort of order. I could
see some of the buyers in the audience leaning forward with interest.

&nbsp;

�Now,� said Brian, beginning what was
evidently a pre-rehearsed interview, �I�m sure you like to tell us about your
capabilities. Your office skills and so forth. What
are you like behind a desk?�

&nbsp;

�I�m very efficient, Sir, always happy to
put in long hours and make sure my boss is happy,� she smiled directly at the
camera.

&nbsp;

�And how about on top of
one?�

&nbsp;

Julia appeared embarrassed, �Well Sir, I am
sure that I have never had any complaints in that direction either.�

&nbsp;

�How about your typing
skills?���


&nbsp;

�I�m quite proficient.�

&nbsp;

�And you find you can manage to see the key
board underneath those tits of yours?�

&nbsp;

�Really, Sir. I�m not sure that�s the sort of question I anticipated at this
interview.� Her prim response was greeted with a quiet ripple of laughter form
the audience.

&nbsp;

�You understand I must have the answers to
these questions though,� Brian said sternly. �Now let�s talk about time
management. Very important for a secretary you�ll agree?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, of course.�

&nbsp;

�Well perhaps you�d tell me how much of
your working week you routinely spend fucking with your boss.�

&nbsp;

�Goodness. What sort of question is that?�
Jules appeared to become flustered. She fanned herself with her application
form. She licked her lips as the camera zooms in on her mouth and reached
behind her head to free her hair from its pony tail. She shook it loose. A
vaguely appreciative grunt could be heard from the audience. I had the
impression that while they were amused by the display, some of them felt it was
all going on a bit too long. Julia looked up at the camera and gave it a knowing
smile. �Well,� she said, �I�ve never refused if my boss asked me to take a few
things down.� 

&nbsp;

Brian continued with his patter. �I see,�
he said. �And the quality of your work?�

&nbsp;

Well,� Julia said, �of course I make
mistakes the same as anyone else. But I�ve always felt that the best policy is
to make a clean breast of it.� With that she quickly unbuttoned her blouse and
her bra and took both of them off, continuing to sit perched on the stool with
her tits naked for the whole audience to see. There were some grunts of
approval and a few coughs. The bidders were clearly appreciative but somehow it
all seemed to have fallen a bit flat, though you could hardly say that for
Julia�s chest. 

&nbsp;

�There you are gentlemen,� Brian concluded.
�Let�s hear your bids for this piece. Can I suggest $80,000?� The room fell
quiet. No one responded. �$70,000 then? $60?�

&nbsp;

�40,� came a call
from one side of the room.

&nbsp;

�45,� responded another. The room was quiet
again.

&nbsp;

�Surely we can do better than that?� Brian
chided. �Excellent secretarial skills and other useful attributes as you�ve
heard. Any more? Is that really all?� He looked almost
irritated with the bidders sitting in the hall. I could see that they didn�t
like that. �Very well then. At $45,000 � it�s you sir,
in the corner. No more? At $45,000 then. For the final time. $45,000 in the room.
Sold!� He brought his gavel down with an abrupt
tap.� 

&nbsp;

Jules looked disappointed as two guards
came on to remove her from the platform. Brian did nothing to hide his sense
that she hadn�t reached her potential price. Julia looked upset and confused as
she was hustled from the stage. The audience simply returned to studying their
sales catalogues. �Funny idea, that,� I overheard one of them saying to a
colleague. �I mean quite amusing and all but it didn�t seem to have much to do
with why we are all here.�

&nbsp;

Immediately after Julia came
Caroline, the girl I had seen being abducted on video when I�d first visited
the Prep Centre. �Lot number 05/209,� called Brian to the audience. He seemed
to sense their impatience and was now trying move things ahead. �I have several
commission bids for this lot�.�� I looked
at the catalogue. Sarah wasn�t on the list. Brian had been adamant that she�d
have to be fully prepped before he�d even thing of including her. I think
Freddie thought he was being a bit ungrateful given that he�d just been trying
to help him out. I wasn�t bothered; it just gave me a bit more time to think of
an excuse to hang on to her for Harry.� 

&nbsp;

All Spice had been through Orientation
swiftly. The Kalinin had asked us to �leave the rough edges on, that way my son will
learn the quicker what it is to manage his wives�. Rick had shipped them up to
the Kalinin after only five days. A week later I picked up a call from the Kalinin on my mobile. �Mr Lawrence,� he said. �I wanted to tell you how
pleased I was with the merchandise that you supplied recently. It certainly
conforms to my expectations.�

&nbsp;

I made some remark about being pleased to
have been able to help and hoping that his son was pleased. The Kalinin enthused some more and then went on, �I think I mentioned that I
had some other business that I thought you might be able to help me with. I was
wondering if you could stop by at a convenient point. Give my PA a call,
Clegg�s got her number.�

&nbsp;

I called Clegg. �I thought you�d like to
know the Kalinin of Kushtia
wants to talk about some further acquisitions.�

&nbsp;

�Good,� said Clegg, briskly. �Maybe your
ideas are working out.� He gave me the number I wanted. �Those five singers
were a good piece of work,� he said. �The snatch squad said it all went very
smoothly.�

&nbsp;

�Well, the Kalinin says he is pleased anyway.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, he called me. His little lad is happy
as a pig in shit and the Kalinin
reckons he�ll be so busy with the five of them that he won�t have time for some
of his other, more expensive, hobbies. Oh, by the way,� I knew now that these
throw away lines from Clegg were usually anything but, �how�s
the video coming on?�

&nbsp;

�The video� was intended to give Clegg�s
clients a briefing on our new direction. �We start scripting next week.�

&nbsp;

�So, not actually started yet?�

&nbsp;

�Well sort of. We know who the script
writer will be at least. In fact I�m just going over to sort out a meeting with
her now. Just to make sure that she gets her mind around the idea of working
for us.�

&nbsp;

�Ah,� said Clegg, perceptively. �Not
actually a willing participant.�

&nbsp;

�Not entirely, no. Well, not at all.� I
said, thinking of the pick up we had planned.

&nbsp;

�Good, good. I can�t stand the idea of
paying writers. Sounds like you�re on the right track. Keep me up to date,
won�t you?�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, sure,� I said. Then remembering I�d
agreed to try to keep Sarah out of the auction catalogue, I thought I�d broach
the subject with Clegg. �Oh, one other thing, I need a red head for the video,
I think. Can I use the one you saw in Harry�s office? It would just save
picking up another one. I don�t want to increase stock for the sake of it.�

&nbsp;

�No, fair enough,� said Clegg. �It might be
worth hanging on to her anyway if the Kalinin�s son has a taste
for that sort of thing and Brian�s not getting such good prices at the moment.
You�d better have her earning her keep, though. She might as well go back to
Harry�s office, if he still needs someone.�

&nbsp;

�Fine,� I said. Harry would be happy that
we wouldn�t have to let Sarah go for a while at least.�� 

&nbsp;

I called the Kalinin from the cab as I headed up to Euston for the train north and the
meeting with our script writer. The Kalinin�s PA suggested we
got together on the Friday. That was fine by me. She gave me a location in North Wales. For the time being
I had other things to do, I had a writer to recruit.� 

&nbsp;

������������������������������������.

&nbsp;

From one of the organisation�s white vans,
I watched the video feed from the flat. It was great the way that the snatch
teams could get surveillance stuff in place now. I could tell Rachel Kernow was thrilled. For the first time in her life, she was
thinking, there was a chance that she would get some recognition for what she
did. Actually she probably felt it was really recognition just to be nominated.
�Best TV or Video Script by a New Author�; even being on the list was a step in
the right direction. And you could see that she really thought she had a chance
of winning and even if she seemed determined to have a fantastic evening. 

&nbsp;

She looked in the mirror checking out the
dress and the shoes that I reckoned must have cost her a small fortune. You
could guess that she was saying to herself, �Hey, a girl has to make an effort,
and that�s not a bad effort. Not Scarlett
Johansson, maybe, but pretty good nonetheless.� She smoothed the purple
silk of the long gown down over her hips, happy that it made the best of her
figure. The matching purple long evening gloves that she wore as well added to
the elegance of the outfit.

&nbsp;

It was then that her door bell rang. She
opened it to a woman in a chauffeur�s uniform. It was Tricia. The chauffeuse
tipped her cap. �Miss Kernow?� she asked. �It�s your
car. For the ceremony.�

&nbsp;

�Terrific,� said Rachel. �I�ve been
expecting you. I�ll just get my bag.��
She snatched up her evening bag, checked that it held the essentials � a
credit card, the notes for her acceptance speech, and a handkerchief to blot
away any tear of delight or, perish the thought, disappointment, and followed the
chauffeuse out of her flat.

&nbsp;

I was watching outside as she got into the
limo. The car was enormous, big and white with blacked out windows. �Is this
all for me?� she giggled as her driver held open the door and she slid onto the
vast leather covered back seat

&nbsp;

I guessed that by now Tricia was into her
routine, �It should have been Miss Kernow, but I have
to pick up another passenger if that�s all right. There was a problem with one
of the other cars.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, that�s fine,� Rachel would be saying,
�No problem at all.� All the research said she was a helpful sort of girl. 

&nbsp;

�Good,� Tricia would reply. �Please help
yourself to a drink, there�s some champagne in the bar cabinet to your right.� I
watched as she stepped around to the driver�s seat and got in. The car pulled
away. I followed in my own car as the limo meandered through the suburbs,
heading towards town. It pulled off of the main road and onto a small housing
estate. The car stopped. Tricia, the chauffeuse, got out of the car. 

&nbsp;

I imagined Rachel in the back of the limo,
sipping some more champagne and watching as she walked up the drive. I was
watching myself. �That�s quite a kinky uniform,� I thought, �boots, tight
trousers, buttons, cap and gloves. Those boots look a bit tight though from the
way she�s walking.�

&nbsp;

The reason for Tricia�s tight boots was
helplessly struggling in the boot of the limousine. Eileen Donald, the real
driver of the car had been ready to leave for the evening�s work when she
opened the door to the garage to find herself staring at a determined looking
woman, pointing a gun directly at her. Forced to strip to her underwear at gun
point, Eileen had been pushed down on the floor of the garage while the woman
wound tape around her wrists and ankles. The woman had wasted little effort in
securing her captive but in moments she was helpless and could only look on as
the woman pulled on the shirt, tie, trousers, jacket, cap and gloves that
Eileen had just taken off. And the boots � the only problem was they were half
a size too small.

&nbsp;

Eileen had been bouncing around in the boot
of the limousine. Well bouncing probably wasn�t the word � the rest of the limo
may have been enormous but the boot was tiny, she was wedged in. Now she would
be aware that they had stopped. No doubt she was listening for what would
happen next.

&nbsp;

I watched as the new passenger, sharply
dressed in a black velvet trouser suit, joined Rachel
in the back of the limousine and the car moved off. Tricia told me how it went
afterwards.

&nbsp;

�Hi,� said Rachel and introduced herself, �I�m Rachel. What award are you up for? Have some
champagne.�

&nbsp;

The newcomer smiled and took a glass from
Rachel. �Hi,� she said. �I�m up for the �Best Author of a True Crime� award.�

&nbsp;

�Scary stuff,� said Rachel, �what sort of
thing?�

&nbsp;

�Well,� she said, reaching into the black
velvet bag she was carrying, �it�s a bit of a coincidence, really. It�s all
about a girl that is kidnapped on her way to a book award ceremony.�

&nbsp;

�What?� said Rachel.
�That�s silly � Oh!� She found herself staring at a gun in her companion�s
hand. 

&nbsp;

�Please don�t make a fuss,� the woman with
the gun said. �Just put that glass down.�

&nbsp;

Rachel did as she was told. �Why are you
doing this? Is it to stop me getting to the award ceremony? Who has paid you to
do this? It�s ridiculous.�

&nbsp;

�Do be quiet, Miss Kernow,�
the woman was reaching into her bag again. �Please put this in your mouth and
fasten it tightly behind your head.� She passed Rachel a bright red ball
threaded on a leather strap. Rachel complied, choking as she pushed the ball
into place and staring, wide-eyed, back at the gun. �Very good,� said the
woman.

&nbsp;

�GMmng,�
whimpered Rachel in response as the car drove on.

&nbsp;

�And now chain your wrists behind your back
with these please.� She passed Rachel a pair of handcuffs. Even through her
gloves, the steel of the handcuffs felt cold and hard about her wrists as they
locked in place. The woman put down her gun.

&nbsp;

Their driver called back, �You two all
right back there?�

&nbsp;

�Hmmmmph,�
grunted Rachel.

&nbsp;

�Yes, all under control,� said the other
woman. �Just one more thing.� She took the black
velvet bag that had held the gun, gag and cuffs. �While I�m sure you are
interested in where we are going, I think you�ll understand why we�re not keen
for you to see,� she said, pulling the bag over Rachel�s head and drawing the
neck of the bag tight around her throat. 

&nbsp;

Rachel, blinded by the bag, gagged and
cuffed, could do nothing as the car sped through the night.

� 

I was already at the safe house when the
limo arrived and watched as Rachel was pulled out of the car with the bag still
over her head. Tricia went to the back of the car and pulled Eileen out of the
boot. The two of them were struggling against their captors. Eileen looked the
worse for her experience, streaked with grease from where she had been forced
to the floor of the garage. She had cut her head in the back of the car in her
efforts to escape. Tricia ignored her efforts to break free for a while but
finally lost patience and slapped her face with a leather gloved hand. �Stop
struggling or there will be more of that,� she warned. She hustled her captive
away. 

&nbsp;

I was pleased with Rachel what I could see
of her. We�d picked her for her writing skills but I�d thought when we�d looked
at the surveillance material that she�d be easy on the eye as well and the
evidence so far confirmed that. Of course I couldn�t see her face but her
figure looked pretty good in the dress she was wearing and the view of her legs
through the slit in her skirt wasn�t bad either. �Take her through,� I said. �I�ll
have a chat with her.�

&nbsp;

They put Rachel in one of the rooms that
opened off the basement garage. By the time I got there she had already been
sitting in the room for half an hour or so, tied to a solid wooden chair. She
was still blinded by the bag but she turned her head towards me as I opened the
door. She started struggling and grunting into her gag, I assumed to
demonstrate that she wasn�t happy with how she had been treated.

&nbsp;

I pulled the bag from her head and she
blinked in the unaccustomed light. I checked her handcuffs. Her gloves looked
creased from where she had obviously tried to free herself but it didn�t look
like she was having any success. I unfastened the strap of the gag and eased
the ball from her mouth. She coughed and groaned. �Please, why are you doing
this?�

&nbsp;

�You�re going to work for me,� I said. �I
need a script written.�

&nbsp;

�You must be joking,� Rachel responded.
�You don�t have to kidnap writers. You just hire them. Anyway, I�ll be missed.
Have you any idea how many people there were going to be at that awards
ceremony? Don�t you think they�ll have noticed that I didn�t turn up? They�ll
be looking for me.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, you�ve been missed all right. The
White Head people were very disappointed that you weren�t there to collect your
award. You did win, by the way.�

&nbsp;

�Bastard!� Rachel spat. Pulling against the ropes that held
her to the chair.

&nbsp;

�I think the press will have a real
field-day with the story. �Award Winning Writer Vanishes� something like that �
lots of coverage along the lines of �Was the pressure all too much? Has Rachel Kernow followed in the footsteps of Agatha
Christie, disappearing in response to the strain?� Actually my money�s on a
story headlined �Winning Author Skips Awards With Gay
Lover� or something similar.�

&nbsp;

�What?� Rachel said. �What sort of stupid
nonsense is that?�

&nbsp;

�The sort that the
newspapers will cook up when they find the passionate letters between you and
Eileen Donald.� I had to confess I was enjoying
myself.

&nbsp;

�Who the hell is Eileen Donald?�� 

&nbsp;

�Oh, I�m sorry. Of course, you didn�t meet.
Eileen was the driver that was supposed to pick you up but got picked up herself instead. Look, don�t worry. All you need to know is
that no one is coming looking for you so it�s probably easier if you go along
with what we want.� 

&nbsp;

�You must think I�m stupid.�

&nbsp;

�No, but for a writer you�re certainly
working your way through the clich�s. Why don�t you try �you�ll never get away
with this�?� Rachel simply glowered back at me. I knew I wouldn�t get anywhere
with her until she�d spent a little time in Orientation. There wasn�t any point
in trying to rush things. I gave a sigh and jammed the ball gag back in her
mouth. She wriggled and grunted as I tightened the strap. The snatch team came
back in. �She doesn�t want to play,� I said. �Ship her up to the Prep Centre
and I�ll talk to her again in a few days.�

&nbsp;

Rachel�s chauffeuse smiled, �Can we play
with her? My partner�s driving the next bit and I do like a girl in evening
dress.�� Rachel looked even more
distressed as the girl eased the strap of her gown off one shoulder. Rachel
looked across at me with wide, pleading eyes. 

&nbsp;

�Sure, I said. Normal rules apply.� I
turned back to Rachel. �Best get used to it,� I said. �You�ll do what we want
in the end.� She shook her head vigorously and the snatch team laughed. I was
quite surprised at myself. It was proving easier to be a villain than I�d
thought.

Chapter 17: Kalinin�s Castle

&nbsp;

Wales was wet. From where I�d stopped the car there should have been a
view of Snowdon. Instead all I could see was the Glaslyn
valley and a sheet of cloud. Porthmadog was sitting
sulking in the last of the winter afternoon�s light at the other end of The
Cob. I looked along the causeway that the road shared with the narrow gauge
railway that once hauled slates down from the Ffestiniog
quarries to the coast and now hauled tourists. There wasn�t another car in
sight.

&nbsp;

I drove on across the Cob and through Porthmadog, past Criccieth with
its castle overlooking Tremadog Bay. It seemed
like I was heading off the edge of the country. I knew the Kalinin was in exile from Kushtia, I hadn�t realised he been exiled quite
as far as he had.

&nbsp;

The sign by the side of the road said, �Abererch Centre For Meditation
Studies�. I turned in and parked outside a formidable, Victorian, dark stone,
house of three stories. The heavy oak front door swung open as soon as I got
from the car. The Kalinin was
there to greet me. 

&nbsp;

Stepping inside the hall was like stepping
into a sultan�s palace. Outside it may have been the epitome of restrained
English Victorian architecture. Inside it was elaborately decorated with
sumptuous gilt carvings and silk drapes. �

&nbsp;

�So pleased you could come, Mr Lawrence, so
pleased you could come,� he beamed. �You�ll take some tea?� He gestured to a
room leading off of the entrance hall.

&nbsp;

�That would be most welcome, your
highness,� I said glad to be out of the car and into somewhere warm and
comfortable. The Kalinin
gestured to a couch and I took a seat. He clapped his hands and a girl in harem
dress appeared, her face veiled but her body very much on display, and fell to
her knees beside him.

&nbsp;

�Tea for myself and my
guest, girl.�

&nbsp;

�At once, highness,� she said getting
immediately to her feet and scampering off.

&nbsp;

�This is splendid,� I said, gesturing to
the room�s extravagant carvings.

&nbsp;

�Thank you, Mr Lawrence. Of course it is
little compared with the home I will have on my return to Kushia.�
The girl reappeared carrying a small tray with glasses of tea. She set them
down on the table between us and left without waiting to be dismissed. The Kalinin watched her go with a sigh. �So difficult to get them to learn
proper respect here,� he said. �Now I will have to see she gets more
instruction as to how to behave. So tiresome.�

�

�You hope to return to your home soon?� I
asked. �Is your exile to end?�

&nbsp;

�With your help, my
friend, with your help. Kushtia is now a
democratic republic. Those that sought to keep me from my throne have been
deposed. The Council of the Kalin has been restored.
They will ask me back, I am sure.�

&nbsp;

�I hope so, highness,� I said, uncertain as
to why this change in the political status in Kushtia should have required me
to trek into the depths of Wales. 

&nbsp;

�Hope is not sufficient. A leader and ruler
must act. There is a tradition which I wish you to help me with. In the past
the members of the Council of Kalin were appointed by
the Kalinin, now the Council is elected by the parliament. That is only proper
if Kushtia is to take its rightful place on the world stage � we must be seen
to conform to the norms of democratic societies. There used to be talk of
corruption; of bribes paid in exchange for seats on the Council. Not in my
time, of course, but nevertheless, you will understand how a government must be
free of any taint.�

&nbsp;

�Of course, highness. Such things can never be acceptable in a modern state.�

&nbsp;

�Of course. But we also recognise the importance of prestige, of status, of
position. In the past, the Kalinin
presented the each member of the council with a new wife to recognise the
importance of their civic contribution. Since all are treated equally there is
no question of corruption. I intend, with your help to ensure the tradition is
continued. You will find me six women, one for each of the Council. They will
see that I respect the traditions. They will understand the value of asking
their rightful head of state to return.�

&nbsp;

The Kalinin was turning out to be an excellent source of business. Freddie
would be pleased I thought. �I am sure we can help, Highness,� I said. �In fact
I am sure there are six available at present. How soon would you like to take
delivery?�

&nbsp;

�No, no, I think they are most unlikely to
be suitable. Most of Clegg�s � what does he call it � stock are young girls,
slim, and slight of build. All of them on diets, I am sure. Obsessed with their
slimness; eating with the appetites of birds. This is fine for those with
modern tastes like my son. But I know the members of the Council. They are men
for whom a woman must have substance.�

&nbsp;

�Substance? You mean they must be wealthy?�

&nbsp;

The Kalinin laughed. �No, no, Mr Lawrence. Wealth is not the question. This is
more an issue of size. They need to be well formed, large of bosom. They need
to be women of experience, not young girls barely in the first flush of
adulthood. No, this is not Mr Clegg�s usual stock. This will need one of your
specialised collections.�

&nbsp;

I listened while he spelt out his
requirements. He was right we didn�t have anything to suit in stock. It would
need a special project but after all that was what I was encouraging Clegg to
think of as our future.

&nbsp;

We discussed the details. The Kalinin was sufficiently confident of the outcome to commit a significant
level of funding up front. I felt sure Clegg would be happy to proceed. We
shook hands on the deal.

&nbsp;

�Enough of business,� said the Kalinin. �I must let you see something of Kushtian hospitality. Did you
like the girl who brought the tea?� He didn�t give me the chance to respond.
�Good, good. She will please you a lot. Come, come, you must have the chance to
rest before your return. And you must see how well is my
son�s new harem.� The Kalinin got
to his feet and gestured to the stairs leading up from the hall. �Let us join
my son.�

&nbsp;

I followed the Kalinin upstairs. He opened a door from the landing into a massive bedroom.
Sprawled on a bed hung with purple and gold drapes was the Kalinin�s son. Alongside
him were two of the members of All Spice � Geri and Mel B � clad in harem
costumes. Two others, Mel C and Baby, were standing chained against the wall
with their wrists above their heads. Drool dripped from their ball-gagged
mouths as they whimpered in discomfort. They had evidently been there for some
time. ��Mr Lawrence, welcome,� the Kalinin�s son boomed
leaping to his feet. He bounded across the room to embrace me. The two girls
knelt up, heads bowed, on the bed. �Father,� he chided, �you did not say our
great friend was coming. Mr Lawrence, I have to say how pleased I am with my
new wives. They still need much training,� I saw that even the two girls on the
bed were still wearing shackles, �but these two bring me much pleasure.�

&nbsp;

�And the others?� I asked.

&nbsp;

�They bring me pleasure too. Although my Victoria needs much correction still.� He
lifted the lid of a large casket at the end of his bed. Inside Vicky was
doubled up, roped and gagged and with the signs of a recent beating across her
back. �The others are less trouble but she will be an obedient wife too, I am
sure. And besides, it amuses me to punish her. Please join us, here.� 

&nbsp;

He waved at the bed. It was big enough for
five. I climbed on. As I did so, the girl who had brought the tea re-appeared.
The Kalinin gestured towards me and she climbed onto the bed alongside me. 

&nbsp;

�You like my body?� she said reaching
behind her back and unfastening her bra before I had the opportunity to
respond. I nodded, smiling as her pert breasts were bared showing pieced and
ringed nipples. 

&nbsp;

�Please, enjoy her,� said the Kalinin. �She will allow you anything but she must keep on her veil. It is
our way that girls must not show their face before they are married.�

&nbsp;

By the time he had finished speaking, the
veil was the only thing that she was wearing and she was busily trying to
remove my clothes so that I might join her in her nakedness. The Kalinin�s son laughed as
he pulled Geri and Mel down on the bed with him. �You see Mr Lawrence we shall
make a Kushtian of you yet.����������

Chapter 18: Rachel�s
Readiness

&nbsp;

I got back from Wales the
following day and went to meet with Rachel, my script writer, at the Prep
Centre. 

&nbsp;

She was no longer wearing her evening gown;
now she just wore a simple short black skirt and matching, low cut, sleeveless
top. One strap of her top was hanging off her shoulder. She also had on the
stiff leather collar and the identity tag that marked out all of those that
were going through preparation. Her face looked gaunt; dark bags under her eyes
testified to nights without sleep. She stared past me with an empty look in her
eyes.

&nbsp;

She�d been brought to one of the interview
rooms. �Hello Rachel,� I said, pointing to a chair. �Sit down.�

&nbsp;

She looked at me, puzzled. �I have to stand
or kneel,� she said in a flat voice. �I�m not allowed to sit. The rules say I�m
not allowed to sit. They punish me if I sit.�

&nbsp;

�I know,� I replied, gently. �But it�s all
right if I say so. You can sit down.� She did so, keeping her legs side by
side, her feet flat to the floor, her knees slightly parted. She was wearing
shackles around her wrists but her hands were chained in front of her. She put
her hands in her lap and sat quite motionless. I could see that her wrists were
bruised from the shackles. Her face was bruised too. She had a cut over one
eye, and a puffy lip. They hadn�t been gentle with her. She could see I was
looking at her.

&nbsp;

�They raped me.�

&nbsp;

�I know,� I answered.

&nbsp;

�The men and the women.�

&nbsp;

�I know. I can make it stop. If you do as I
ask then I can make it stop.�

&nbsp;

�That�s what they said. If I do as I�m told
all will be well. I�m trying to do as I�m told. Can you make it stop?�

&nbsp;

�If you write for me. If you do as you are told.�

&nbsp;

�I�d like you to make it stop.�

&nbsp;

�Good. I�ll send you some papers. They�ll
explain what I want. You�ll be given a computer to write with. You�ll give the
files to your guard. He will give them to me. As long as you do as I ask it
will stop.�

&nbsp;

�No more rape?�

&nbsp;

�No. Not if you do as I ask.�

&nbsp;

�It was so many times. I�ve lost count. Both in front and behind. And in my
mouth.�

&nbsp;

�I know.�

&nbsp;

�Sometimes they tie my wrists before they
rape me. Sometimes they spread my legs out with a bar. Sometimes they gag me.
Sometimes they let me scream.�

&nbsp;

�I know.�

&nbsp;

�And you can make it stop?�

&nbsp;

�If you do as I ask.�

&nbsp;

�Are you going to rape me?�

&nbsp;

�No, not now.�

&nbsp;

�Not now?�

&nbsp;

�No, because I think you are going to do as
I ask. At least at the moment I think you will do as I ask. If I find that
doesn�t happen I may change my mind.� 

&nbsp;

�Thank you,� Rachel said. �I want you to
make it stop. I don�t want you to rape me. I don�t want them to rape me.� I
pressed the button. 

&nbsp;

A guard appeared. �She�s to have a computer
in her cell,� I said, �No network of course. And some papers I�ll send. She�ll
provide files each day. She�s not to be raped. As long as she behaves, and
provides the files, she�s not to be raped.�

&nbsp;

�Understood,� said the guard. �I�ll pass
the word.�

&nbsp;

I saw her later, watching her through the
panel of one way glass. She was seated at a table. A chain ran from her ankle
to a ring in the wall. She had been given a computer and the file of papers.
She was reading the file. She put her head in her hands. I could see she was
sobbing. She stopped after a few moments and looked back at the door of her
cell and then back at the file. She turned on the computer. It seemed like I
was going to get my script.� 

&nbsp;

I went off to speak to Harry. Sarah in his
outer office doing the PA thing just as she had been before Freddie had thrown
his little spanner in the works. She greeted me with a smile and buzzed through
to Harry without being asked. �Mr Ross for you, Sir,� she said into the
intercom. Harry told her to send me in and she ushered me through the door into
his office.

&nbsp;

�How are things now Sarah�s back in her
seat?� I asked.

&nbsp;

�Fine,� said Harry. �Thanks for your help
with that. I don�t know why Brian wouldn�t take her for that sale. She�d have
helped his numbers no end. Freddie was furious.�

&nbsp;

�Was he?�
He didn�t say anything.�

&nbsp;

�No, that�s the worst time. Freddie when
he�s quiet is a worrying prospect.�

&nbsp;

�Well, I guess that�s Brian�s problem,� I
said. I wasn�t feeling terribly sympathetic. �Still, what I wanted to see you
for was this video stuff I�m doing. I ought to include Sarah, because I told
Freddie that was why we were hanging on to her. It�s only some prototype stuff
at the moment but I�ll need her for a few days. Is that OK?�

&nbsp;

�Sure,� said Harry, �I can hardly complain
can I? She wouldn�t be here at all if you hadn�t put your ideas up. I�ll set it
up now.� He buzzed on the intercom. �Sarah, come in please.�

&nbsp;

�Yes at once,� she said and was through the
door almost before the click of the intercom had died away.

&nbsp;

�Sarah,� Harry said. �Larry wants to make a
video an example of the stuff we�re going to use to help sell girls on the web
site. He�s asked that you take part in it.�

&nbsp;

�Well if you can do without me. I mean I
don�t want to let you down.�

&nbsp;

�That�s all right, Sarah. Please do all you
can to help Larry.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, of course, if you say so.�

&nbsp;

I turned to Sarah. �Let me explain a bit about
this. I need a short sequence of a slave selling herself. You�ll be interviewed
on camera, asked to show some of your dancing skills, that sort of thing. You
needn�t worry about it too much, we�ll steer you through it.� I didn�t wait for
her response. �We�ll start right now.� Harry put in a call from his phone. A
few moments later a guard appeared. I asked him to take Sarah over to the room
I�d had set up. �They'll sort you out there,&quot; I said to Sarah. The guard
gripped her by the arm and almost pulled her through the door.

&nbsp;

Two days later with Sarah returned to her
cell I took the video up to show Harry. �I thought you might like a preview,� I
said, slipping the disk into his DVD player. The video opened with a close up
shot of Sarah�s face, her mouth distended by a bright red ball gag. Behind her
head, out of sight, the strap was loosened and the gag pulled clear. She worked
her jaws to relieve the stiffness, licked her lips and swallowed. �Thank you,�
she said.

&nbsp;

�Right, #06/085,� it was my own voice off
camera. �You are going to need to be convincing if you want to stand out from
all the other slaves on offer. Let the buyers see what they would be getting
first of all. Stand up!�

&nbsp;

The camera zoomed back as Sarah got to her
feet. You could see that she was wearing a short tight fitting mini-dress with
cap sleeves and a scooped neckline that just showed some cleavage and, of
course, her collar. She held her hands modestly in front of herself. Her hair
was loose, as red as ever, hanging in waves to her shoulders.

&nbsp;

�Turn around!� Sarah did so, compliant as
always. As she did so the camera zoomed out further giving a shot of her legs
in black tights. �And sit please.� Again she did as she was told, sitting in
the approved manner, feet side by side and flat to the floor, hands in her lap.
The camera zoomed in slowly to fill the screen with a shot of Sarah from the
waist upwards.

&nbsp;

�Personal details,� I said peremptorily.

&nbsp;

�I am #06/085,� she answered. �23 years old and five feet four inches tall. I weigh 115 pounds
normally. You can see I�m a red head, I think. I was collected in early March
and I�ve completed my basic training. I�ve learned the basics of obedience and
I hope that my trainers would agree that I have been a good student.� She
turned to look at the camera and bit her lower lip, obviously concerned that
the audience should indeed believe her.

&nbsp;

�You�re a dancer, I believe. You have some
skills in that area which I am sure prospective purchasers would be interested
in. Please show us.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, well, I�m not a professional or
anything it�s just what I do at week ends at the clubs in town for fun. But if
you think the buyers would like to see it, of course I will.�

&nbsp;

She got to her feet. A Northern Soul medley
kicked off on the sound track. I know they�re corny but I�ve always been a
sucker for the floor fillers from the Wigan Casino and I reckoned they would
fit our demographic better than some of the techno that turns up in the clubs
now.�� Curtiss
Mayfield started off with �Move on Up�. Sarah seemed to managing it nicely. I�m
no expert on dance and I certainly couldn�t tell you anything about her moves
except to say that she managed to combine an athletic movement with a graceful
timing and soulful interpretation of the music. It looked like, for a few minutes
she�d forgotten where she was and why she was doing what she was doing. Her hair span out like a halo around her head as she gyrated in
time with the music. K C &amp; the Sunshine Band came on with �She�s the
Queen of Clubs�. Sarah picked up her tempo to match. I had her finished on a
slower track; Frank Wilson�s �Do I love You?� She did
the business to that as well. I left off the tracks that I thought might upset
her. I didn�t think Fontella Bass and �Rescue Me� or
Edwin Star and �SOS� would be quite the thing. 

&nbsp;

The music stopped and Sarah returned to her
seat. �Thank you,� I said.

&nbsp;

�Was that all right?� she asked looking
over her shoulder towards where she had been dancing. �I could do some more if
it helps?� She looked back towards the camera. �I hope everyone enjoyed that.
Please watch the rest.� She smiled nervously, uncertain of what was to happen
next.

&nbsp;

�That�s fine #085,� I said, �But now we
need to see some more of your body.� She started as two masked guards came in
and gripped her by either arm. In and admirable display of obedience she
allowed herself to be led from the stage only to reappear moments later. In the
intervening moments she had been stripped of her dress. Now she wore only bra,
panties, stockings, a suspender belt, high heeled shoes and her slave stock
collar. Her gag was back in place, forcing her lips into a big round �O�.

&nbsp;

�Walk up and down, please, 085,� I said.
She did as she was asked, swinging her legs from her hips, making the most of
her heels, clasping her hands behind her back as she had been instructed. �And,
stop. Hand behind your head.� The camera panned over her body lingering in
close up over her tits, belly, hips, crotch and calves. �Turn around please.�
The camera tracked up. �And bend please.� She reached forward, Fit as she was, she had no difficulty in clutching her ankles as I had
asked. The camera took a good shot of her tight arse before zooming back to see
her looking back through her spread legs, her red hair tumbling to the floor
behind her head. 

&nbsp;

�And move again please.� Sarah got up and
span around. She placed her right hand on the chair she had been sitting on and
lifted her left leg until it was at hip height. She changed hands and did the
same with her right leg. The audience would be in no doubt of her athletic
abilities. �Let us see your breasts, please.� She looked at me for a moment and
then obediently reached behind her back and unfastened her bra, stripping it
off and dropping it on the chair. The camera zoomed in again, filling the
screen with her pert breasts and the dark areolas surrounding her nipples. The
camera zoomed out. �And walk.� She began to parade up and down the platform.
�Head up, back straight,� I ordered. She stiffened in response. �Shoulders
back, breasts out. And turn�.� She walked back. �And turn. Keep your shoulders
back and breasts out please. Thank you. And turn��

&nbsp;

The video footage came to a close. The
screen went black.

&nbsp;

�What do you think?� I said to Harry.� 

&nbsp;

�Well she knows how to take direction,
that�s for certain,� he said with a grin. �But I think I knew that already.
Seriously though I think it looks quite good. Have you worked out what you�re
doing with it yet?�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, I think so. But at least with that
in the can we can convince Freddie we�ve done something and she can get back to
work in your office tomorrow.�

&nbsp;

�Well thanks for that Larry,� Harry said.
It�s been a real help having her around. Let�s hope we can keep on thinking of
excuses to hang on to her.�

&nbsp;

Chapter 19: Something for
the weekend

&nbsp;

The Kalinin�s requirements for
Council of Kushtia had been precise. Between him and his son, I was coming to
understand that Kushtians were capable of developing
fairly specific tastes.

&nbsp;

Luckily, I�d been able to work out how to
satisfy them. 

&nbsp;

I was sitting in the lounge of a
comfortable 1930�s style house, looking out across a perfectly manicured lawn.
The rum punch on the table in front of me was completing a pleasant afternoon.
I was about to be joined by Alessa Moran, which was
possibly the only down-side. I�d worked with Alessa
before. She could be over-powering, tiresome even, but she could usually fix
things.

&nbsp;

Alessa burst through the double doors from the hall. �Larry,� she gushed,
�how LOVELY to see you.�

&nbsp;

�Alessa,� I
responded getting to my feet. �always a pleasure.�
Like everything else, Alessa invariably took
greetings to extreme. The conventional kiss on either cheek was, as usual,
repeated three times and accompanied by a rib crushing embrace.

&nbsp;

�Well,� she said, �this was a little
challenge, wasn�t it?� Alessa looked, as always,
striking. Her black jacket and skirt were perfectly tailored; her buttercup
yellow blouse contrasted with the suit and her own dark skin. She sat down and
crossed her legs, smiling all the time. She shook her head as she laughed, her
mass of tightly curled, black hair bounced like a sprung ball. She was an
incorrigible flirt. I could tell that she knew exactly how far up her thighs
her skirt had ridden. �But such fun and so good to be working
with you again.��� 

&nbsp;

�I�m sure you�ve come up trumps, Alessa. I hope you were able to keep this quiet?�

&nbsp;

�Absolutely, Larry,
absolutely. All done through
my company, no mention of anyone else. You know me, the soul of
discretion.�

&nbsp;

Alessa was the soul of discretion like Liberace was shy but we�d been
monitoring her emails and her mobile. It seemed like she had managed to keep
her mouth shut about this little project.

&nbsp;

�It�s very exciting, Larry! I�d never
realised you had contacts in the fashion business. And it�s such an exciting
idea, why shouldn�t bigger ladies have sexy swimwear too?�

&nbsp;

�So, you�ve managed to find me some
models.�

&nbsp;

�Of course, Larry, of
course. They�re getting changed now. Six lovely ladies. I think they�ll fit the bill for your
project.�

&nbsp;

I�d just passed on the Kalinin�s requirements to
Alessa though I had interpreted the way in which the Kalinin had expressed them. Six women, he had said. At least 40 years old,
possessed of a bosom able to comfort a man after many days in the desert and a
seat that will endure ten days ride of a camel. I had also not been entirely
honest about the exact reason why I was interested in seeing them. Alessa thought they were going to model a new range of
swimwear for the well endowed, mature woman. And she was right, they were right
now, it was just I had other plans for their future. �Well, let�s see them,
then,� I said.

&nbsp;

�Right away, Larry, right away. I�ll just
check that they�ve got changed. They were all supposed to bring a costume but
you know what models are like.� Alessa wandered off
in the direction of the hall. She returned moments later. �All ready, Larry,
darling,� she said. �All ready. You sit down and we�ll give you a show. Oh, I
brought some music.� 

&nbsp;

She slipped a CD into the hi-fi and pressed
�play�. Strains of the Beautiful South spilled out of the speakers. �She�s a
perfect ten, but she wears a twelve. Honey keep a
little two for me�.� I put my head in my hands. Alessa
was definitely the down side of this project.

&nbsp;

The first of her models strode in wearing a
shiny black one piece bathing suit. She certainly fitted the bill � probably forty
two or forty four inches around the chest. Her swim suit was well cut and lycra does a wonderful job. She
stopped in front of me to spin around. I guessed she was forty five years old,
maybe a little more. She was well covered, for sure, and while she didn�t have
the body of a fitness freak, she still looked as if she took care of herself.
She posed, hands on hips, directly in front of me, smiled, turned and left. At
the rear, she was sufficiently well upholstered to cope with the Kalinin�s notional camel
ride, I thought. Not bad for a woman of her age.

� 

The next went through the same routine. She
was bigger breasted and a little bigger around the waist and a little shorter
too, blonde hair and a really friendly smile. She would be fine too, I thought
as she left the room.

&nbsp;

Four more followed, each stepping
confidently across the room, high heeled mules clacking on the wooden floor. At
the end all six returned and stood in one long line across the room. Alessa made a big thing of the costumes. �I hope you
approve Larry, you said they�d be doing swimsuit modelling. I told them all to
bring something that showed them at their best. Look at the woman on the end
there, doesn�t she just show that an older woman can wear a two piece if it�s
well designed and well made? Don�t you agree? And that purple costume is really
the right colour for the one on the left, isn�t it. Such a flattering shade. I only hope I�ve got their same
fashion sense when I get to their age.� She smiled in anticipation of a
compliment. I grunted in response. It didn�t dampen her enthusiasm. �And
they�re all available for an overseas assignment at short notice, just like you
asked. Three of them are single, two of them have just divorced, and the other
one is widowed.� she laughed. �I found them through that divorcees, widows
&amp; singles support group. Such a clever idea of yours.
They�ll all be glad of a bit of excitement, I should think!�

&nbsp;

I asked the girls to walk around in a
circle. I needed to be sure they�d fit the bill but I was pretty confident that
the Kalinin would approve. Irritating as she was, Alessa
had done a good job. Two blondes, three brunettes � two of
them greying slightly with a salt and pepper look � and one suspiciously
orange-haired redhead. Two long legged and tall, two of them rather
short. All of them well covered and with bosoms that would offer sufficient
comfort. They might all be over forty but they certainly didn�t look over the
hill. I thought the range would get the Kalinin�s approval.
Without knowing the tastes of the individual Councillors it was difficult but I
guessed there would be something to suit each of them. 

&nbsp;

I clapped my hands. �Thank you ladies, thank
you. That was fine. If you�d like to get dressed now.�
The six of them relaxed and left the room, chatting and giggling like young
girls. I turned to Alessa. �Well,� I said, �we need
to talk. Let me just make a call. Excuse me.�

&nbsp;

I followed the girls out into the hall,
leaving Alessa in the lounge. As the last of the six
went back into their changing room one of the snatch squad emerged from the
room next door. I gave him a thumbs up sign. �They�re
fine, I said. �All six.� He smiled and went back into his
room. I went back to Alessa.

&nbsp;

�You like, Larry? You like?� Alessa was as enthusiastic as ever. �You see how I meet
your every need?� She smiled at me encouragingly and sat back, opening the
jacket of her suit. Her own bosom was as well able to offer comfort as those of
her models. She�d taken the opportunity while I was out of the room to undo one
more button of her blouse. The cleavage revealed looked as if it would swallow
a small Kushtian without a trace. I suppose it was intended to distract me. 

� 

�Very good Alessa. Absolutely
fine. Just what I was looking for. They�ll be
perfect.�

&nbsp;

�So where are you planning to do the
photo-shoot? Somewhere exotic I hope�

&nbsp;

�Exotic? Yes, I guess you�d call it
exotic.� I was thinking that I didn�t actually know much about Kushtia but I
was working on the basis that anywhere that you hadn�t heard of was likely to
count as exotic.

&nbsp;

�Well, I hope I�m invited too. After all
the trouble in setting this up, Larry, it�s the least you can do. I fancy a
little winter sunshine. We could enjoy ourselves while the girls work.�

&nbsp;

�Alessa, I�d love
you to come. In fact I�m going to absolutely insist.�

&nbsp;

�Wonderful, Larry wonderful.� Alessa beamed. �When are we going?�

&nbsp;

�Oh quite soon. I want to get on with this project quickly.�

&nbsp;

�Terrific, I�ll tell the girls right now.� Alessa leapt to her feet and was off towards the changing
room as quickly as she could go in the heels she was wearing. I followed her.
She was going to find out sooner or later, it was really too much effort to try
to damp down her enthusiasm.

&nbsp;

As Alessa burst
through the door to the room that the girls had been using to change, she gave
a startled cry at the sight in front of her. Two men were busily applying ropes
to two of the women, Tricia, the third member of the team, was holding two
others at gun point with their hands in the air. She gave me a friendly wave. The
last two had already been roped and gagged and were sitting on the floor trying
vainly to free themselves; rolling from side to side in attempts to loosen
their bonds and grunting in a frustrated way into their gags.

&nbsp;

Tricia turned her attention to Alessa. �Over here lady,� she said. �Join these two. Hands
up and keep quiet.� Alessa did as she was told, first
staring at the pistol that was jammed against her belly and then watching in
horror as the last two of her models were forced to the floor to be tightly
trussed.

&nbsp;

�Larry, what on earth is this?� Allessa gasped. I didn�t bother to answer her.

&nbsp;

I looked around at the way things were
going. The team had done a neat job. Two of the girls were still in their
swimming costumes, the one in the black lycra one
piece was putting up quite a struggle but the ropes were showing no signs of
letting her get free, the one in purple seemed to have abandoned hope of escape
already, staring in terror at each of the snatch team in turn. One of the
others had got into her skirt but she hadn�t put on her bra or top when the
snatch team had disturbed them. They�d had fun with tying her up, lengths of
white rope criss-crossing her tits, cutting painfully into the flesh. The
redhead was completely naked, she was rolling around
on the carpet grunting and groaning into her gag. The other two had got back
into their street cloths before the snatch team came in.� It didn�t really matter; they were all going
to be stripped off back at the Prep Centre anyway.

&nbsp;

Alessa was fuming. �Larry, what is going on?� she demanded. �This isn�t
the sort of thing I expect.� Even with her hands up and a gun pointing at her
she seemed to think she should be able to control things. Tricia didn�t seem
impressed.

&nbsp;

�Is this one coming too?� she asked.

&nbsp;

�Oh, yes I replied. She�s really keen to
join the trip. Aren�t you Alessa?�

&nbsp;

Alessa turned towards me. �Have you gone mad?� she fumed. �Oww!� She yelped as one of the
team grabbed her arms and wrenched them behind her back. The ropes were jerked
tight around her wrists and then her elbows. She kicked out at the man,
scraping the heel of her shoe down his shin. In response he dragged her around
and pushed her down face down across the large table that stood against the
wall. The impact knocked the wind from her. �Dumb bitch!� the man exclaimed
passing a loop of rope around her ankles and knotting it off. �That�ll slow you
down.� He pulled her up from the table and span her
around.

&nbsp;

I walked across to where she was. One of
the snatch squad�s kit bags was sitting on the table. I rummaged in it and
pulled out a wad of foam. �Alessa,� I said, �after
having to put up with your constant stream of chatter, you�ve no idea how much
pleasure this gives me.� I nodded to the man holding her. He grabbed at her curly,
jet black hair and pulled. She reacted with a yelp and I pushed the foam into
her open mouth. Ignoring her choking and spluttering I slapped a length of tape
across her mouth and followed it with two more. Alessa�s
muffled groans and protests joined the chorus of complaint from the six other,
helpless, women.

&nbsp;

�Shall we get them shipped out?� the man
holding Alessa asked. The captive women set to with a
chorus of muffled grunts of complaint.

&nbsp;

�Yeah, sure, I answered, earning still more
terrified moans. �But just one thing.� I turned back
to Alessa who was still struggling against her
captor. �Alessa, dear,� I said, �you�ve
really been taking great trouble to flash your legs at me today. So I think I
should take a closer look.� I reached around her and unclipped the waist band
of her skirt, I slid the zip down and let her skirt
fall to the floor. �Very nice,� I said admiring the sight of her legs. �And
you�ve been so keen to show me what�s in your jacket,
I can hardly miss out on that, can I?� I pushed the jacket back off her
shoulders.

&nbsp;

She squealed as I grasped her blouse and
tore it open. �Excellent,� I said, as I pulled the blouse back to expose her
breasts, her yellow bra and panties pale against her almost black skin. �Well,
I think they�ll be plenty of people enjoying that view over the next few days.�
I turned to the man holding Alessa. �O.K.� I said. �now we can go.
Let�s get them on the truck.�

Chapter 20: Not In The Script

&nbsp;

With the Kalinin�s
requirements well in hand, I had some time to spend on the video. I�d sketched
out the framework for Rachel and she�d already let me have a storyboard and I�d
set up to visit the Prep Centre to run through the script.

&nbsp;

I�d told them to let her have some decent
clothes as long as she was behaving. When I got there I could see that she was
making an effort to impress, she�d obviously been well enough behaved to keep
the guards happy. Or maybe she�d been using some other talents to achieve the
same ends.

&nbsp;

One thing that I�d found while working for
Clegg was there wasn�t much time for civilised conversation with the guests. It
was a pretty much relentless production line that ran them from the pick up
point to the Sales Centre and out. A shame really, I thought, as I looked at
Rachel.

&nbsp;

They�d put her to work in one of the Prep
Centre cells. She was sitting at the table that held her computer. She had a
brown manila folder in front of her. �Well, Miss Kernow,�
I said. �You look rather better than when I last saw you.� The bruises had gone
and the cuts had healed. She�d managed to find a colourful, knee length skirt
and a pale blue sweater from somewhere. She looked, well, attractive, in a
girl-next-door sort of way. Of course, she still had the leather collar and tag
on, which spoiled the effect somewhat.

&nbsp;

�They stopped raping me,� she said. �Thank
you.�

&nbsp;

�That was the deal,� I said. �You write for
me and you don�t get raped. I bet you didn�t get as good an offer as that from
your regular literary agent.� 

&nbsp;

She gave me a humourless grin. �Does the
same thing go when I give you the script or does that mean you just take your
turn then?�

&nbsp;

�That�s not very kind,� I said, though I�d
been thinking she look a whole lot cuter with the skirt up around her waist and
the sweater up around her neck. But that�s what working for Clegg does � it
tends to change the way you look at girls. �There will be other projects,� I
said. �Maybe we can keep the arrangement going.��� I sat down at the desk. �Show me what you�ve
done.�

&nbsp;

She hesitated a moment before pushing the
folder across to me. I opened it. The neatly printed sheets inside were clearly
laid out. Scenes, camera angles and shots, dialogue, sound effects, it all
seemed to be there. I started reading through it.

&nbsp;

������������������������������������.

&nbsp;

I read it through to the end. I expected
that there would need to be changes but it looked as though she had done a good
job to start with. �This looks fine,� I said.

&nbsp;

�Great,� she replied without enthusiasm.
�Does it get to win an award?�

&nbsp;

I let the irony pass. �I could get you a
drink, if you like. I�ve got some vodka in my bag.�

&nbsp;

She thought about it for a moment and then
said, �Why not?� 

&nbsp;

I turned around and bent down to get the
bottle out. 

&nbsp;

You should never turn your back on a
writer. You never know what will happen to the plot. 

&nbsp;

What is it with girls, me and drink, I
wonder? I mean Amanda brained me with a vodka bottle and it was while I was
finding a drink for Rachel that she hit me too.

&nbsp;

Not with a bottle admittedly. This time it
was the edge of her computer keyboard. It slammed into the back of my head with
a very painful impact. I toppled forward over the bag and then fell to the
floor. I didn�t quite lose consciousness, which was a shame as Rachel was
shouting �Bastard!� and kicking seven kinds of excrement out of me. However, I
was sufficiently disorientated not to put up any sort of struggle as she pulled
the lead from the computer keyboard around my wrists and the power cable around
my ankles.

&nbsp;

That was bad enough. Then she jammed the
computer�s mouse into my mouth and wound the cable round my head a few times to
keep it there.

&nbsp;

She�d obviously thought about this a lot,
while she�d been writing my script she�d obviously been working on one for
herself.

&nbsp;

She gave me another kick, this time in the
groin. Luckily, with my ankles tied together and the fact that I was coming to
enough to try to dodge, she didn�t really manage to land it. Even so the heel
of her shoe scraped painfully across my thigh. If my mouth hadn�t been stuffed
I�d have given out a cry that should have been enough to bring the whole lot of
the guards in. Except, I remembered, they were quite used to gag-muffled cries
of discomfort around here, Just to be sure she knotted the cord from the mouse
to the one around my wrists and my ankles. That bent me up and I thought she
was about to land another kick when she thought better of it and headed out of
the cell, locking the door behind her.

&nbsp;

Not even a good-bye, I thought as I tried
to free myself from the cables while avoiding choking on the block of plastic
wedged in my mouth.� 

&nbsp;

Of course it had to be Harry that found me.
�I thought you�d given up on this,� he smirked from the cell door. �You�re
obviously not safe left alone with a woman � fall too easily for their charms.
Why don�t you hang on there for a minute and I�ll see if I can find your lady
friend.� Ignoring my grunts of frustration and complaint, he shut the door.

&nbsp;

In fairness to the guy he must have
mentioned my condition to someone because the Doc came in a few moments later.
She set to, untying the cable around my mouth first of all and pulling the
mouse carefully out. �Ouch,� she said, �that must have hurt. She might have
broken some teeth but I think you�ve been lucky.�

&nbsp;

She managed to untie the cable from around
my wrists and I sat up, untying my own ankles. �Thanks,� I said.

&nbsp;

�Don�t mention it,� she replied, with a
grin. �It makes a change untying someone.�

&nbsp;

�Shouldn�t there be alarms going off?� I
asked. �You know, wailing sirens, flashing lights, that sort of thing.�

&nbsp;

Harry reappeared at the door. �No need,� he
said, �she won�t be far away. I just needed to get my tracer. Do you want to
come find her?�

&nbsp;

�Tracer?� I asked.

&nbsp;

�Uh, huh,� said Harry, pulling a small box
from his pocket. It looked like a voltage meter. �Those collars they wear
aren�t just there to hang their slave number tags on,� he said. �There�s a
little chip inside and with this little box we can walk right up to her. She
won�t have got her collar off unless she�s found a cutting torch lying around
somewhere. Come on. If you can walk that is.�

&nbsp;

The Doctor and I followed him out of the
cell and down the corridor leading to Despatch. He showed me the box, the
needle was pointing off to one side, through the door of a janitor�s cupboard.
Harry put one finger to his lips asking for quiet. He took out his wallet and
pulled out what looked like plain sheet of paper about the size of a bank note.
He picked away at one corner with a finger nail until a plastic backing sheet
came loose. He pulled that clear and slipped the paper under the bottom of the
door.

&nbsp;

A few seconds later there was �Phoosh� noise, smoke started to appear under the door which
moments later burst open. A coughing and spluttering Rachel emerged from a
cloud of acrid looking, orange, smoke. She ran into Harry�s arms. �Stupid
bitch,� he said as he hit her with the edge of his hand on the side of the
neck, knocking her unconscious. He let her slide limply to the floor before he
turned her over and pulled a cable tie tightly around her wrists. He turned to
me. �Had you two finished, or was there something else you needed to discuss?�
he asked. 

�

�No we�d finished,� I said. �She can go
back in her cell. In fact,� I wasn�t feeling too pleased with her, �you can tell the team she�s back on the �available� list
until further notice.�

&nbsp;

�Oh good,� said Harry. �It�s always nice
when someone that�s been off-limits becomes available. Do you want to book a
slot?�

&nbsp;

�Not right now,� I said. �I�m afraid I�ve
got a headache.�

&nbsp;

Harry laughed, pulling the slowly
recovering Rachel to her feet. �Fair enough. She
probably has too, but I don�t think it will make much difference to the guards
or anyone else that wants to play.� He dragged her off towards the cells. I had
some sympathy for her. Then I went to move and felt the pain where she�d kicked
me. The sympathy wore off quickly.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 21: Bar Talk

&nbsp;

It was the following day. Harry and I were sat
in a small bar in a hotel overlooking the river. He�d been up in town for a
meeting with Freddie. I felt I at least owed him a drink for helping sort out
Rachel. He�d been good enough not to make too much of a joke of it around the
place, too. He�d been sympathetic about what happened and gave me a bit of a
lecture on not turning my back on work in progress. Nothing I didn�t deserve. I
wasn�t going to let it happen again.

&nbsp;

It was mid afternoon and we were almost the
only ones in the room. A group of three girls sat on stools at the bar,
chatting and laughing. We took our beers off to a quiet corner. I could see
Harry was giving each of the girls an appraising look.

&nbsp;

�See anything you like?� I said.

&nbsp;

Harry took a pull on his bottle of beer and
spoke under his breath. �Hmm, maybe $120,000. The one on the left possibly a bit more than $40k, not sure.
Sparky, ought to train well. Easy pick up too, careless with her stuff � see
how she�s just left her handbag on the floor. It�s a sure sign - no idea about
her surroundings - you�d bag her before she knew anything was happening. Other
two might go down well with the eastern Europeans,
shape�s all right, weight�s all right. Nothing special though � can�t see them
fetching the sort of margins we�re looking for now.�

&nbsp;

�Silly of me, I guess,� I said. �I wasn�t
really talking shop.�

&nbsp;

Harry chuckled, putting his beer down on
the table. �Oh, sorry.�

&nbsp;

�I sort of meant, what do you do for fun?�

&nbsp;

He
stared down at the beer bottle. I wondered if I had touched a raw nerve. �Larry,
you�re right,� he said. �I guess doing this you stop seeing women as fun and
start seeing them just as dollars and shipping weight. Quite a lot of the time
it�s as if they�re not wearing clothes even. You can watch their naked bodies
as they walk by � you�ve seen so many of them stripped, you know what they�ll
be like. The only surprise now when you get them naked is whether they�ve had
themselves tattooed. I wish they wouldn�t do that though, it�s much harder to
shift the ones with marks � especially some of the designs. We had one we
picked up a while back, had so little spare flesh we could barely find space to
put a bar code on her.� 

&nbsp;

I nodded.

&nbsp;

Harry went on. �It�s odd really. You stop
thinking of them as people at all. Take the one in the middle � she�s wearing
an engagement ring. So I�m thinking, watch out for the fianc� turning up at an
inconvenient moment, maybe he�s a possible patsy for her disappearance. That
portfolio case propped up against her stool � looks like she might be a bit
arty � could mean she gets to galleries; great snatch venues, plenty of quiet
corners. Slim build, blonde hair � maybe your Caribbean pal would like her;
looks like she�d be good between the shafts of a pony cart.� She looked up,
noticed that Harry was looking at her and smiled. Harry stared blankly,
ignoring her look, and went on talking. �Whereas actually she�s this really
nice, normal, girl who does a perfectly good job in an ad agency somewhere and
has slipped out for a bit of fun with her girl friends on a Thursday afternoon
before she goes home to fuck the arse off her fianc� tonight. Somehow you don�t
think about their real lives, except like it helps plan the snatch.� Harry
looked up as a waitress made her way over from the bar. �Uh-oh,� he said, with
a grin, �Here comes $50k.�

&nbsp;

The waitress came over to our table, picked
up my empty bottle and put it on her tray. �You boys all right?� she
asked.� We nodded. �Do you want another
beer?� she asked me. I said, �Sure.� Harry shook his head. Two other guys on
the far corner of the bar were calling out to the three girls. The girls were
ignoring them. Pointedly. �Jeez,� our waitress said,
�you�d think this was some sort of slave market the way some men carry on. They
treat them like they�re pieces of meat.�

&nbsp;

�Shocking,� said Harry. One of the girls
span round in response to some remark or other and raised a finger to the two
men. One of them started to get to his feet. The waitress went over to try to
calm things down.� She was standing with
her back to us, hands on hips as she argued with the men. �Nice arse,� said
Harry, quietly. �She�d be good for some of the spankers we�ve got on the books.
Strapped down, with that up in the air, nicely framed with garter belt and
stockings, you could see the price going up.� She was pointing at the door. The
two men got to their feet and made a few abusive remarks before up-ending a
beer bottle and storming out. The waitress got a cloth and started cleaning up.
�There,� said Harry, �domestic skills too. The price is going up all the time.�

&nbsp;

�We weren�t talking shop,� I chided.

&nbsp;

�Eh? Oh, yeah.�
Harry was obviously having trouble switching off. He took another pull at the
beer.� 

&nbsp;

�I mean do you ever date any of the team?
Or is that frowned on? Obviously it�s going to be difficult with a girl from
outside the business but there�s a few around Clegg�s operation that look like
they might be fun.�

&nbsp;

�Well,� said Harry, �I try not to get
involved with any of my lot; that can really make life difficult and it�s a
sure recipe for fowl-ups in my book. There�s been a few from Rick�s team that
I�ve hooked up with. The trouble is when you see them coming out of the shower
and think, �that�d look nice on the platform� or when you wake up in the
morning next to them and its �oh fuck, she�s loose, �where are the ropes?�. I guess this job just
screwed me up. How about you?�

&nbsp;

�It�s funny,� I said, �you�d think with
women available any time you want, it�d be like some sort of dreamland. Doesn�t seem to work like that, though. Hang on.� I noticed
the waitress coming back.

&nbsp;

�Sorry about that gents,�
she said. �Was it still just the one beer?�

&nbsp;

Harry said, �No I�ll have one as well now,
thanks. Do you get a lot of trouble in here? Doesn�t look like the sort of
place that you would.�

&nbsp;

�No,� she said, �not usually. And usually
I�m happy to let them get on with it. The girls can give as good
as they get and as long as they aren�t actually fighting and it doesn�t disturb
the other customers, I don�t mind. It was just that short arsed guy � the one
with the ginger hair � called me a thick bitch that would be better with a
bottle jammed up my fanny*.�

&nbsp;

�Not nice,� I said.

&nbsp;

�No,� she said. �I�m not thick � I�ve got a
history doctorate: �The Growth of Brewing and Wine Trades in Late 13th
Century England�. Only thing is there�s more need for bar staff than there is
for historians.� Harry laughed. �I�ll get your beers.�

&nbsp;

�Bright girl,� I said as she left.

&nbsp;

�Yeah,� said Harry, �always a problem.
Mostly they just end up gagged for more of the time. Still worth remembering if
any of your accounts comes looking for a medievalist with a great arse.� He
grinned and downed the last of his beer. �Still,� he said, �it might be fun to
see if I could park something other than a bottle in her fanny*.�

&nbsp;

�OK,� I said, �here�s a challenge for you.
Get a date, take her out, take her home. Screw any
part of her you like but see if you can get through to tomorrow without
actually wrapping her in rope or tape and dumping her in a crate somewhere.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, maybe,� he said as he watched her bringing
us our beers.

&nbsp;

She gave him a smile and a warm, �There you
go,� as she put them down and left us.

&nbsp;

�What about the other
three? $120k of prime cuts,
just asking to be put on Rick�s conveyor. Look at the mouth on that one
at the other end, wide as anything, very nice lips. Lot of buyers go for a big
mouth, Larry. Skinny wrists though - need to be careful with that, might slip
out of handcuffs.�

&nbsp;

�Harry, take your mind off the job for one
night. Go date the waitress. Talk to someone outside of our world that you
aren�t planning to snatch for one evening.�

&nbsp;

Harry smiled sheepishly. �I guess I do get
a bit caught up in it all,� he said. �You might be right. I�ll maybe see you
tomorrow.� He got to his feet and headed off towards the bar. I downed the last
of my beer and started to leave. I waved at Harry as I went by him. �So what do
historians do when they finish serving beer?� I heard him saying to the
waitress as I left.�� 

&nbsp;

I was heading north to find out how Rachel
was getting on and to see Rick.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

* American readers please note: �fanny� is
a British slang word for cunt not arse, what you call
a �fanny pack� we call a �bum bag�. I wouldn�t want anyone to feel that Harry
didn�t know his way around a woman. J

Chapter 22: Ready For My Close Up Mr Demille

&nbsp;

In her Prep Centre cell, Rachel was in a
pretty sorry state. The guards and anyone else that felt like it had taken the
opportunity presented by the �available� sign on her cell door. Someone had
started chalking five bar gate counts on the wall by the door. It had reached
twenty eight. As I got to her room, the Prep Centre�s receptionist was emerging
with a smile, clutching a strap-on dildo and a harness. �Hi, Larry,� she said,
�back again?� as she ticked off another stroke on the wall. Twenty
nine.

&nbsp;

I nodded.

&nbsp;

�Your writer has been giving everyone a
good time,� she said, hefting the strap-on with a smirk. �Makes
a change for us support staff to get a chance to play.�

&nbsp;

I edged past her into Rachel�s cell. As I got
in the receptionist called after me. �Oh, Larry, I�ve left my tit clamps on
her. Be a love and drop them off at the desk when you�ve done, could you?� 

&nbsp;

Rachel was sprawled on the floor in one
corner of the room. She was in a terrible state and it had only been two days
since I turned the guards loose on her. If she had looked shocked before, she
was almost catatonic now. They�d replaced her standard collar with a broad one
that forced her head upwards. Her mouth was distended by the wire frame gag that
held it open. Her eyes were staring unblinking from dark hollows in her face. I
couldn�t work out at first what she was wearing but finally realised it was the
tattered remnants of the sweater and skirt that she had on when I�d last seen
her, torn by the mistreatment that she had suffered over the last two days. Her
tits were purple, and sore, the steel claws of the tit clamps, pinched into her
nipples. Her hair was lank and greasy, sticky with I wasn�t sure what; her face
puffy from where her mouth had been used repeatedly. They�d strapped her wrists
to the tops of her arms and her ankles to the tops of her thighs, leaving her
breasts, arse and cunt available for any
intrusion.� From the bruises on her legs,
especially on the inside of her thighs, it was clear that she�d had a lot of
attention. Seeing me, she gave a whimper of recognition.

&nbsp;

I bent down and unfastened the ratchet on
her gag. Even with the wire frame removed her mouth stayed open as though her
jaws were locked wide. I took the nipple clamps off. She gave a sharp,
animal-like, cry in the back of her throat as the blood started to rush back
and feeling returned in a wave of pain. Minutes went
by before she regained the use of the muscles that allowed her to talk.

&nbsp;

�Th, th, thank you,� she stammered, hardly able to form the
words, �I�m sorry. Please stop this. I�m sorry.�

&nbsp;

�I stopped it before and look what
happened. Why should I stop it again?�

&nbsp;

�I, I, I know. I can�t bear this any more
though. Over and over again. So many
times. Please. I�ll do anything.�

&nbsp;

�You say you will, Rachel, of course you
say you will. And right now you believe, it too. But
I�m not sure I can risk it. It took a long time to lose that headache.� She
looked scared at the prospect that I would not relent. �We�ll give it one more try though.� Her expression changed to one of relief.
�You�ll work on the script. There are some revisions.� She nodded animatedly.
�You�ll be kept shackled, though.� More nods of agreement. �There�ll be no more
rapes. IF you behave. But if you don�t you�ll be
beaten and you�ll be back in here with the �available� sign on the door. Do you
understand?�

&nbsp;

She nodded. I still wasn�t convinced. I
should have let Rick do a proper orientation job on her. I aimed to mention it
to him later. He could have a go as soon as we finished the first script. I
left Rachel, giving instructions to the guards to clean her up and put her back
to work on the script. They were disappointed of course but later I heard they
were laying odds on how soon she�d be back on the available list. I gave the
receptionist her tit clamps back. She grinned and asked if I fancied playing
with them later. Somehow I wasn�t in the mood.�


&nbsp;

I was on my way over to see Rick when I
bumped into Harry as he strolled down the corridor with a cheery smile on his
face. �Uhhuh,� I said sensing that he�d had a good
time the night before. �So you did get to date that waitress.�

&nbsp;

�Is it that obvious?� he asked.

&nbsp;

I nodded. �I hope she�s still footloose and
fancy free. Tell me she isn�t languishing down stairs somewhere.�

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry Larry, I took your advice.
Absolutely no business whatsoever and some extremely agreeable and very
conventional sex, right up to the point��

&nbsp;

�Oh, Harry!� I said, �that
wasn�t the idea.�

&nbsp;

�No, listen,� Harry responded. �Let me finish.
Right up to the point where she said, �I hope you don�t think I�m kinky, but
have you ever tied a girl up?� It took all my self control to give her a less
than honest answer.�

&nbsp;

I guffawed in response. �Oh well,� I said,
�at least you tried.�

&nbsp;

�No, don�t knock it, Larry. It was good,
straightforward, uncomplicated fun and we both ended up grinning like idiots
and covered in sweat.� I had a great
time. I think I might do it again.�

&nbsp;

�With the waitress?�

&nbsp;

�Oh, I sort of have to really,� he said. �If only because of her name.�

&nbsp;

I looked blank.

&nbsp;

�It�s Sally,� he said. �You know, �When
Harry Met��

&nbsp;

�I�ve heard it,� I said and left him, still
grinning, to search out Rick.

&nbsp;

I found him in his office. I was clutching
the version of the script that I already had. �How are we going to set this up
then?� I asked as we sat together. �You�ve seen the script. We need to get the
girls looking presentable and showing themselves off to best advantage.�

&nbsp;

�Well, I�ve made a start,� said Rick. I�ve
put a small team together to help. You�ve not really seen much of the Prep
Centre staff yet have you?�

&nbsp;

I shook my head.

&nbsp;

Rick continued. �The Prep Centre isn�t just
about basic slave conditioning. I also try to get the merchandise into a
condition so it can get a better price when it gets up to Brian�s sales centre.
We need to help the girls to look good and they need to be healthy too. They
get quite a lot of physical mistreatment as part of their training but there�s
nothing worse than a scrawny, bruised body on the auction block.�

&nbsp;

�Well, I�ve only seen the guards. I hadn�t
realised there were any other staff.�

&nbsp;

�Not staff as such,� Rick smiled. �More sort of slaves. Well, not �sort of� really.�

&nbsp;

�Silly of me,� I said. �Freddie wouldn�t
want to pay for that sort of thing would he?�

&nbsp;

�Uh-huh,� said Rick shaking his head. �Very careful with his pennies, our Mr Clegg. Come and look
in here, I�ve got the team together.� He opened the door of his office, walked
across the corridor and unlocked the door to one of the Prep centre cells. As
the door opened six girls, all dressed in identical, white, button-through,
short sleeved, dresses, got to their feet, turned towards us and bowed their
heads. 

&nbsp;

I looked around the cell. It was quite an
improvement on the conditions that the merchandise had to put up with. There
were two couches, a couple of arm chairs, two low
tables. In one corner of the room there was a television. A pile of DVD�s stood
beside it. On one of the tables was a heap of magazines.

&nbsp;

�My training team,� said Rick. �Carry on
girls.� They went back to what they had been doing before our arrival. One was
busy working on the make up of another, a third was trying to create for a girl
with long dark hair a particularly elaborate hairstyle modelled on a photograph
in one of the magazines. Another sat cross legged on the floor in front of the
TV watching a group of girls working out in a fitness video. �Now let�s see,�
Rick went on, pointing out each of the girls in turn. �These two are our
beauticians. This one is a qualified hair stylist; her guinea pig here is a
choreographer. That one is a physical training instructor � she�d been a
personal trainer in her local gym, now she�s making sure our merchandise is fit
for purpose. And that one,� he pointed to the last of the girls sat reading on
the couch, �that one was a medical student.�
Now she provides nursing services for the group. They have an easier
life as long as they do what we ask of them. They�re excused rape � though I
don�t mind if they want to get it on with any of the team willingly � and you
can see their work cell is quite comfortable. We give them the stuff they need
to keep up to date on their field of work. Plus their overnight accommodation
is better too; sheets on the beds, lighter weight restraints, stuff like that.
OK?�

&nbsp;

�Yes fine,� I said, �and have they got
started with the cast yet? Oh rats!� I cursed as my mobile phone started to
ring. It was the Kalinin. I felt obliged to take it.

&nbsp;

�Ah, Larry, so
pleased to have caught you,� he said. �I wanted you to know that the shipment
you organised for me has arrived in Kushtia.�

&nbsp;

�Good, good,� I responded. �I hope you are
satisfied with the goods.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, indeed,� said the Kalinin lapsing
into the oblique terminology that we all used when using telephones. �The
upholstery is quite up to our expectations and the pieces are all of most
acceptable quality. Very good for the year of manufacture in
every case.�

&nbsp;

�Well, I am glad you are pleased I hope
that these items are soon gracing the bedrooms of your Councillors.�

&nbsp;

�They are already, Mister Larry, they are
all ready. And providing great comfort to all, I am very sure. The Councillors
will find them a very appropriate gift, I will achieve my aims. Oh yes and the
other piece, the one in ebony; most unusual for Kushtia.�

&nbsp;

He was talking about Alessa.


&nbsp;

�I�ve decided to keep that for myself. Not
such a well aged piece as the other items but I think with time it will prove
excellent. Let me say how much I appreciate your generosity with the ebony
piece.�

&nbsp;

I�d included Alessa
as a complementary. Well, after all the Kalinin had taken
11 pieces from us, it seemed only reasonable to make up the round dozen. She�d
have been furious if she�d known she was a freebie of course. After all, the
woman has her pride.

&nbsp;

�Now one more thing. I have a friend that I think you can help. A Mr Hannani. He will call you. He has my personal
recommendation to you as you have to him. That is the way we like to do
business in Kushtia. I am sure you can help him. I have told him of all the
wonderful things you have done for my son and myself.
Oh yes, I should say my son�s five piece suite is still proving most
comfortable. He is hardly ever off of one of the couches or chairs.�

&nbsp;

The Kalinin�s use of
the furniture metaphor was getting stretched but I was pleased he was so
satisfied. �Thank you, your highness,� I said, �I hope that they are proving to
be sufficiently hard wearing,� I heard him chortle, �and we will do all we can
to help Mr Hananni. Thank you for recommending us.�

&nbsp;

�Not at all. It is all I can do.� He said his goodbyes and hung up. 

&nbsp;

I apologised to Rick and returned to the
matter in hand. �Sorry. Are they working with the cast yet?�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� said Rick, �They had their first
class with them this morning to get them set for a training session this
afternoon. We can see how things are going, if you like.�

&nbsp;

�Sounds good to me.� I followed Rick out of the cell and he locked the door. He showed
the way to a cell with a large open area. Inside it six women, faces
immaculately made up, hair carefully coiffured,
wearing nothing but their lingerie were walking slowly around in a circle. A
girl in a white button through dress was standing to one side calling
instructions. Three guards were sat in a corner of the room playing cards.
�Head up ladies, posture is everything,� called the girl in the white dress,
�shoulders back, please, and chests out, remember you have to show your assets
off to their best advantage. And smile please, always remember to smile. Now
step out. From the hips and one and two and one and two.
That�s better. Good. Wait! Stop! 317 � you�re out of
step. I�ve told you before. You must keep in step.�

&nbsp;

One of the guards put his hand of cards
down slowly, got his feet and walked across to the group.

&nbsp;

�Alright, 317,� he said. �Take off the bra.�

&nbsp;

The offender whimpered but slowly complied,
dropping the garment into the middle of the circle where it joined a small pile
of underwear. The guard went back to his seat and the girls started off again.
�It�s all part of the training programme,� Rick explained. �They make a
mistake, they lose one item of clothing, if one of them ends up naked she gets
beaten, if they all lose more than ten pieces, they all get beaten.� Rick
turned to the guard. �How many is that now?�

&nbsp;

�Six, boss,� the Guard answered. The girls
had gone into a huddle. 317 was coming under pressure
from the others. �That�s your fourth item, you�re going to get us all thrashed.
We�re going to be beaten just because you�re not paying attention,� one said.

&nbsp;

�It�s not my fault,� 317 responded don�t
the edge of tears. �I�ve never done anything like this. I am trying really.�

&nbsp;

�She is you know � and you lost your robe
when you missed your footing on those heels. And I lost mine when I wasn�t
standing up straight.�

&nbsp;

�Yes but that was only once. She�s lost her
robe, both gloves and now her bra.� 

&nbsp;

�Yeah, I�m not going to get beaten because
she can�t keep in step.�

&nbsp;

�All of you, back in your circle,� the
woman in white called. �Start again, heads up, chests out, think elegance,
smile and step out. Step out. No! No! No! 317 again! You�re still out of step.�

&nbsp;

The guard went across again. �Now the
girdle,� he said. �I hope you�re all looking forward to your beating.� The four
that had been attacking her looked furious, the one that had defended her was looking
worried too. The four of them were murmuring under their breath until the guard
told them to shut up.

&nbsp;

�Start again,� the woman in white called.
This time they managed to continue for a few more circuits. Before
she called a halt. �335, you are not smiling. That is absolutely not
acceptable. I�ve explained it all enough times now.� 

&nbsp;

335 added her robe to the pile. Rick spoke
a few words quietly to the woman in white. She looked pale and put her hands up
to her mouth. Rick came back to join me. �Come on, let�s go,� he said. �They�re
going to be at this for a while. I just told her that if the girls get beaten
she�ll join them.�

� 

I walked by the training room a little
later on. All six girls and their trainer were strapped down, bent over a low
beam with their arses pointing skyward. Two of the guards were making their
selection of whips from a rack on the wall. Interestingly I noticed that 317
still had her stockings, shoes and garter belt on. She�d only lost one more
item while the girl that had been criticising her had managed to loose
everything but her panties. �There you go,� I thought. �It doesn�t do to
criticise too soon.�

&nbsp;

Chapter 23: Couch
Potatoes

&nbsp;

The training was finished, the script was
finished. The first version of the video was shot. It was time to show it to
Clegg.

&nbsp;

Clegg sat back in his arm chair opposite
the big video projection screen. �OK,� he said, �let�s see it.�

&nbsp;

I sat in the chair alongside him and hit
�play� on the remote. The Clegg logo span around in
the middle of the screen and then dissolved to show a helpless girl in a car
boot. A girl standing with her hands chained over her head followed, then another shot of a girl bound helplessly and pushed into
a crate. Then the scene switched to an office. The camera panned around to face
a woman, seated behind a desk. It zoomed in on her face showing her wide smile.
In her mid forties, with big hair and a suit jacket with shoulder pads thick
enough to land a helicopter on, she looked like she had stepped out of 1985.
�Hi,� she said. �I�m Angie Dennison. You�ll remember my hit 80�s show �Miami
Detective�. Quite a few of our dramas dealt with ladies in distress. Even me sometimes!� She laughed. �Nothing in that series
compares with what happens these days. Just watch��

&nbsp;

I could see Clegg was leaning forward
appreciatively. �How the devil did you get [i]her[/i] to
introduce this? And what on earth does she think she�s comp�ring?�

&nbsp;

I let the video keep running.

&nbsp;

The picture on the screen dissolved to the
auction room in the Sales Centre. Angie�s voice continued. �What will be the
fate of girls like these?� As the picture came into focus five women could be
seen sitting on the stage. Each was perched on a tall bar stool and wore a low
cut dress with a short tight skirt. They all sat identically, hands clasped in
their laps. They all wore the collars and number tags that marked them out as
victims of Clegg�s snatch squads.

&nbsp;

The voice of a man off screen said, �Number
302 come forward please.� The first of the girls climbed down form her stool
and walked towards the front of the stage, teetering on high heels and making
effort to walk gracefully in a skirt that was both too tight and too short for
comfort. �302, your details please.�

&nbsp;

The girl looked to one side, obviously
towards the voice that was directing her. �Your details, please,� the voice
repeated. She turned back towards the camera.�


&nbsp;

�I�m twenty one years old, a trainee
accountant from Maidenhead in England.
My measurements are 34, 23, 35. I�m 5 feet six inches
tall and weigh 113 pounds. In my new life I could be your very personal
assistant, because you see, as well as having a head for figures I know how to
make use of my own.� She reached behind her, obviously unzipping her dress. She
shrugged off the shoulder straps and let the dress fall to the floor. �Wouldn�t
this make going over the month-end numbers more interesting?� she said,
slipping the bra strap from her right shoulder, smiling at the camera and
running her tongue across her lips. 

&nbsp;

�Thank you 302,� the voice said. �Please
put your hands behind your back.� She did as asked. �Now tell us a little more
about yourself, please.�

&nbsp;

�I�ve recently completed the first year of
an accountancy course which I passed. I play sports at weekends - I�m part of a
women�s hockey team - and I exercise regularly. I�m, I�m,� she hesitated.

&nbsp;

�Go on, 302, the voice
urged.

.

�I�m not particularly sexually experienced
with either men or women but I have learned many of the basic skills during my
initial training here and I�m sure I will be able to satisfy any prospective
buyer in that area.�

&nbsp;

�Thank you very much, 302. Please take your
seat.� She walked back towards her stool. �Number 317,
please.�

&nbsp;

The second girl came forward, her dress no
less revealing than that of her predecessor, her heels no less high, her walk
made slightly easier by the hip-high slit in her skirt. �Your details please,
317.� The girl stared at the source of the voice. �Go on.� She shook her head
and held her face in her hands. �Go on, 317. I am sure
you wish to be cooperative. You will remember how important this is for you. Do
as you have been instructed.� The girl bit her lip, looking from side to side.
�Go on!� the voice barked. �Your age, your measurements, your
weight, your skills. Continue!�

�

Slowly, the girl began. �I�m, uh, twenty
three years old, from a small village in Oxfordshire, England.
I am, I was a secretary for a firm of lawyers in Oxford. My,
measurements are 38, 25, 36. I�m five feet three
inches tall and weigh 120 pounds. I could be your very personal secretary,� she
was looking at the floor now, �and I am sure you�ll want to take the law into
your own hands.�

&nbsp;

�Look up, 317,� the voice ordered. 

&nbsp;

The girl appeared to pull herself together.
�I�m a competent typist and I can handle most office administration. I like to
go clubbing, I�m a good dancer and I�m good to watch.� She unfastened the front
of her dress and took it off. She was clearly a little fatter and less fit than
the first girl but her bigger breasts would be attractive to many. �I�ve had
about twelve lovers, all but two of them men. You�ll find that I am sexually
skilled with both my mouth and my hands.�

&nbsp;

�Thank you 317, that was better,� the voice
said. �Now please give us a smile and return to your seat.�

&nbsp;

The girl did so.

&nbsp;

The picture dissolved again to Angie
Dennison. �Abduction, kidnapping, white slavery.
Whatever you call it, these girls will have a whole new life.� The picture
returned to the auction room. 

&nbsp;

The girls were back on their stools,
dressed quite differently, still wearing their collars and tags but now all
gagged. The voice spoke again. �Girls, now you have the opportunity to
demonstrate your skills for your potential new owners. Number
323, please.�

&nbsp;

A woman wearing a smart business suit, hat
and gloves, stepped forward.

&nbsp;

�Now, 323, you told us you were the sales
manager for a packaging company. You also claimed you were used to using your
charms on both your customers and your colleagues. Perhaps you can demonstrate
that to us now?�

&nbsp;

Music started and the girl looked straight into
the camera. She struck a pose, hands on hips, head back. As the beat of the
music picked up she began a sensuous striptease. Peeling her gloves off with
the assistance of her teeth, she unbuttoned her jacket and trailed it behind
her as she walked across the stage. She returned square to the camera and
started to unbutton her blouse, bumping her hips as she did so. Her blouse
followed her jacket to the floor of the stage, with her skirt and slip soon
after. She spent longer parading herself in her underwear before removing her
bra, stockings, shoes and finally panties. 

&nbsp;

The music faded. �Thank you, 323,� the
voice said. �Return to your seat.� The camera zoomed in on the face of 323 as
she stooped to collect her clothes. The camera caught the girl flushed with the
effort of her dance; the beads of sweat, the drool from the gag and the streaks
of mascara across her face.

&nbsp;

�And now, 331, our
student from Cardiff.� The voice spoke once more. �Now
you said you enjoyed amateur dramatics and your last performance was in �Flower
Drum Song.� So, let�s see what your buyer can expect from you.� A slight
looking girl walked onto the stage wearing a short, blue silk cheong-sam, holding her hands palm to palm in front of her.
She fell to her knees at the front of the stage and bowed her head to the
floor. Then she lifted her head to show the bright blue ball that filled her
mouth as a gag. She was swaying from side to side as she stayed on her knees in
front of the camera. She smiled and got to her feet, ripping the fastening of
her dress open and stepping out of it before going into an acrobatic dance
routine that ended with a flying cartwheel and a splits landing, her face only
inches from the camera.

&nbsp;

The source of the voice could be heard
applauding from off stage. �Impressive, 331, impressive.
Thank you.� She picked up her dress and threw it over her shoulder triumphantly
before skipping off stage.�� 

&nbsp;

The image of Angie Dennison returned to the
screen again. �But that�s all in the future. Why are they here? How did their
luck run out?� The screen split, Angie�s face still in one part seeming to
watch the other where the camera was close-up on another gagged girl, her face
filling the rest of the screen. A hand off screen unfastened the gag and pulled
the ball from her mouth. 

&nbsp;

�My number is 335,
I was acquired for an owner in Sarawak. He wants a new slave to teach his others the skills of western
cooking. I was working in a small restaurant when I was approached by one of
our customers who said he was looking for a new chef. I agreed to prepare a
meal for him and his friends to demonstrate my skills. They ate the meal and
pronounced themselves satisfied. One of them produced a gun,
the others tied me up and forced me into a car. I have learned some other
skills and I leave for Sarawak tomorrow.�

&nbsp;

She was followed by an athletic looking
blonde. Again the camera zoomed in on her face as her gag was removed. �My
number is 342. I was acquired for an owner in Surinam.
He wants a slave to run a fitness regime for his wives. I was a personal
trainer. I was out jogging with one of my clients. I enjoyed working out with
him; he had been seeing me for two months.�
We had jogged our route many times before. I felt quite safe with him of
course. But the last time, as we jogged past a van, I was grabbed, pulled
inside, bound and gagged. My client has now been seeing to my training. He has
been teaching me skills that he tells me I will need in Surinam.
They have the money for me now, they say. I am being shipped on Friday.�� 

&nbsp;

Each of the others turned up in their own
screen split in turn. �Acquired for an owner in Sinkiang�, �an owner in Kachin�, �to do the administration of his businesses�, �to
teach his slaves English�, �to join his breeding slaves�.

&nbsp;

The slaves faded out. Angie�s face filled
the screen. The camera pulled back, She was sitting in
a large arm chair smiling directly at the camera. �So, there you have it -
we�ll listen to what you want. And we�ll see that you get it.�� The picture froze as text scrolled across the
screen, �Clegg Enterprises offers a custom service in slave acquisition,
finding exactly the right property to meet your needs. We�d like to talk to you
about how we can help.� The picture faded to black.

&nbsp;

I turned up the lights, peering at Clegg
anxiously. He broke into a broad smile. �First class!�
He exclaimed. �First class! Angie Dennison, good
grief. Brings back fond memories of adolescent television
viewing. For some of the older guys it�s The Avengers, for me it was
Miami Detective. How did you get her to do that?�

&nbsp;

�Well, we weren�t entirely honest,� I said.
�Here watch this � it�s the video footage we shot of her doing the �come-on�
advertisement that we told her we were making to attract sponsors for a new
series.�

&nbsp;

I started the video player again. On came a
shot of Angie in the armchair talking directly to the camera. �Can we get on
with this? Jeez you guys are slow. I�ve worked with real film crews you know �
MGM, UA, Touchstone, � � A voice from someone off
camera says quietly, �RKO.� �What was that?� said Angie but she was interrupted� by a
clapper board appearing. �Scene 105, take 14, mark!� 

&nbsp;

Angie composes herself instantly, smiles
and continues, �Hello. I�m Angie Dennison. You�ll remember my hit 80�s show
�Miami Detective�. Quite a few of our dramas dealt with ladies in distress.
Even me sometimes! But nothing in that series compares with what happens these
days. Just watch�

&nbsp;

�This is a new series of Miami Detective
for the new century. It will be must see viewing just the way the 1980�s series
was. But now there are new crimes to combat. Abduction,
kidnapping, white slavery. Whatever you call it, these girls will have a
whole new life. But that�s all in the future. Why are they here? How did their
luck run out? What will be the fate of girls like these?

&nbsp;

�Each episode of Miami Detective �06 will
follow the fortunes of one victim of crime and how the perpetrators are brought
to justice.

&nbsp;

�I�ll be there too. You�ll see me again as
�Salty� Anders � Captain Anders this time � and no doubt I�ll get into some
scrapes too.� But here�s the trick and
this is what makes Miami Detective �06 different. Miami Detective �06 will work
with viewers. We�ll listen to what viewers want each week on our web site.
Viewers will directly affect the story lines. We�ll listen to what they want.
And we�ll see that they get it. Just like Miami Detective in the �80�s every
episode will feature some of the most attractive young actresses around. Your
company could be one of the lead sponsors on this show and help shape the story
lines too. So, there you have it - we�ll listen to what you want. And we�ll see
that you get it. I�m proud to be a part of Miami Detective �06 � I hope you
will be too.�

&nbsp;

&quot;Cut,&quot; another voice called.
&quot;That's fine Angie. We'll use that one. Great.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;About fucking time,&quot; Angie's
scowl showed itself through her botox frozen
forehead. &quot;I've been pissed around all morning. Fuck know
how you guys will make a series if you get the funding.&quot;

&nbsp;

I turned the video off. �Marvellous what
you can do with a bit of editing,� I said.

&nbsp;

�First rate job,� Clegg enthused. �Shame
you didn�t tell me you were shooting. I�d have liked to have met her. Liked to have more than met, if I�m honest.�

&nbsp;

�I�m glad you said that,� I said getting to
my feet. Clegg looked puzzled. I opened the door to Clegg�s office. Harry was
outside as agreed. Without saying anything he wrestled a woman into the room. 

&nbsp;

Clegg got to his feet. �Angie Dennison!� he
roared in a combination of recognition and approval. �Well I�m certainly
delighted to meet you.� 

&nbsp;

�Hmmgh,� Angie
grunted into her gag. We had dressed her in as close to the costume from the
�80�s series as we could get. We�d got a blue short sleeved uniform shirt and
tie, with the Miami Police insignia and a straight black skirt. We�d even
managed the regulation handcuffs � even if they were locked around her wrists.
They�d gone in for over the mouth gags in the original series so in deference
to that Angie was wearing a scarf across her mouth. Of course her mouth was
packed with foam and taped shut underneath it � there are limits to
authenticity. I wasn�t keen to be around when Clegg took her gag off; I�d had
enough of an ear bending from Angie when she found out what we had planned for
her after filming the promo.

&nbsp;

�We�ll leave you to get acquainted� I said.

&nbsp;

�Thank you very much Larry. And by the way
� I think you�ve proved your point about the value of matching what we do to
what the customer�s want � I�d have paid a great deal for this. We�ll talk
about what you want to do with the video at some other point.���� 

&nbsp;

I grinned and waved to the pair of them as
I made to leave.

&nbsp;

�Oh,� said Clegg, �by the way. What
happened to that red-head of Harry�s?�

&nbsp;

I looked him straight in the eye. �I shot
some footage with her but it didn�t really fit in when we came to cut the final
version,� I said honestly, waving another disk. �I can let you see it if you
like.�

&nbsp;

�No,� said Freddie, �not a problem. I just
wondered.�

&nbsp;

Yes, I thought to myself and I wonder what
you�d have said if I hadn�t done anything with her.��

Chapter 24: Sebastian�s Web

&nbsp;

I�d left the City offices and gone back up
to the Prep Centre. I needed to talk to the IT folk about the other part of my
plans. As usual there was a problem finding a parking place with Clegg Meat
Products trucks all over the place.

&nbsp;

Eventually I managed to squeeze the car in
and headed into the building. �I�ve got an appointment,� I said to the
receptionist. �Sebastian in IT?�

&nbsp;

�Sure,� she said, punching a number into
her phone. She spoke into the mouthpiece, �Seb? Visitor for you.�� She
put the handset down and turned back towards me. �He�ll be over in a minute.
Take a seat.�

&nbsp;

I�d barely the chance to thank her before a
figure appeared through the door from the admin areas.� He looked like Murdoc
from Gorillaz. It ain�t a
great look, even if you�re a cartoon, but he seemed friendly enough. �Hi,� he
said, �you�d be Larry.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, hi. Have you got something to show me?�

&nbsp;

�Sure,� he said, �come on through and meet
the team.� He showed me through, back along corridors I�d seen when I�d first
visited the Prep Centre. We got to a door. It had a card pinned to it, �Seb�s Harem�. Sebastian stopped. �Just before we go in, let
me explain a couple of things. All the team I�ve got working on this are
pick-ups, not staff. They all think they�re working their tickets too � Do a
good job and the bonus is a free pass out of here. It isn�t true, of course but
it�s a hell of an incentive.�

&nbsp;

�OK,� I said, �sounds
like good use of resources to me.�

&nbsp;

�Like your style, man,� Seb
said and opened the door.

&nbsp;

I saw what they meant by the sign on the
door. The team was six girls, not one of them could have been over twenty years
old. They all wore mini kilts in different tartans,
they all wore white shirts, some of them tucked into the waist bands of their
kilts, some loose, one with her midriff bare and the shirt knotted up under her
tits. They all wore thin, straight, black ties, some knotted up to their
throats, most loose showing beneath the collars that were routinely put on when
pick ups were booked in to the Prep Centre. 

&nbsp;

I looked appreciatively as they busied
themselves at their tasks. �I like your style too,� I said.

&nbsp;

�Well,� said Seb,
�I guess it�s a bit of an indulgence but a man�s got to give in to his
enthusiasms. Come over here, I�ll give you a demo � the site that is, not the
girls,� he grinned. �214,� he called and one of the girls turned towards us. It
was Jackie. She didn�t appear to recognise me. �Show us the site, please.�

&nbsp;

Jackie slid between us and sat down at the
keyboard. A few taps brought up a web site in her browser window. �OK,� said Seb, �this is the entry portal,
it�s a pretty ordinary BDSM photo and video gallery site. All the usual
membership features, forums, all that sort of stuff. This bits not finished yet
but it�ll do for now. To get beyond this you need a security token and some souped-up encryption software which Jackie here has
developed and when you�re in you get this��

&nbsp;

The page was headed up, �Larry Ross � My
Control Centre�. Underneath were panels headed up �My Projects�, �News�,
�Catalogue�, �Search &amp; Snatch�

&nbsp;

�Let�s deal with the easy ones first, said Seb. �The �News� section is pretty self explanatory � they
can get details of forthcoming auctions, special offers and so forth, we�d
feature videos of the prize items in upcoming sales and they can select live
web cams of particular cells to view lots as well. The section headed up
�Catalogue� is just a list of any of the stock that we have on hand at any one
time with photos and the key details about them. There are sort options so they
can view the catalogue by age, height, racial characteristics, colour of hair and so on. We can also put up a series of
video clips for each of them too. I thought we might have a sort of rotating
view as standard, a short interview and then anything that showed off
particular skills.�

&nbsp;

�Fine,� I said, �that sounds pretty much
like what I had in mind. What about the other areas?�

&nbsp;

�Well, you know you said people wanted to
feel we were solving their problems, meeting their specific needs. The other
two areas are meant to deal with just that. Look at this. I�ve mocked it up on
the basis of your last few projects.� 

&nbsp;

I looked at the �My Projects Area�; there
was a short list: �Kalinin�s Son Project�; �Kalinin�s Councillor�s Project�; �Clegg Video Project�. Jackie clicked on
the link to the �Kalinin�s Son Project�.

&nbsp;

�Buyers can set these up themselves,� said Seb. They fill in a requirements form. They can get at a
copy of that through here. Our progress reports and video footage �
surveillance for example � gets published through here. They can feed-back on
specifics as they see how things are going and using this we�d get their OK
before any pick up. That should mean we have less redundant stock � we quite
often pick up a girl for a specification and discover later that she doesn�t
quite fit in some way; then she�s back in here for resale at whatever we can
get for her.�

&nbsp;

�Right, right. I could see that working. What about the �Search &amp; Snatch�
area?�

&nbsp;

�Now that�s the bit that�s really clever, thanks
to my little team of lovelies here,� he gestured at the girls who had all
gathered round to watch. �This is really intended to open up the buyers mind to
the opportunities out there. Try it yourself.�

&nbsp;

Jackie got up and let me take her place. I
clicked on the Search &amp; Snatch button. Up popped a form.
Down one side was listed a series of links under the heading� �My Saved Searches� with the unpromising
titles of �Test 1�; �Test 2�, �Test Search Blondes� and so on. In the middle of
the form was an array of tick boxes. At the top it said, �Search &amp; Snatch : Explore our on-line database of a wide range of
possible UK products. Search on the basis of your choices. Choose those that
you think you would like to own. Clegg Enterprises will provide a customised
quote for acquisition and delivery.� I looked more closely at the tick boxes.
One provided for age ranges, one for colour of hair, one for racial type, one
for skills and qualifications, one for height another for weight and so on.

&nbsp;

�Go on,� said Seb,
�try it.�

&nbsp;

I found myself thinking of Rebecca. Suppose
I�d been looking for someone like her. I ticked a number of boxes; 26-30,
English / British, 5 foot 4 inches, 110 � 120 pounds, blonde, flight attendant.� I hit the �search� button � it occurred
to me after that �submit� would hardly have been appropriate. 

&nbsp;

I�m not sure what I expected but I
certainly hadn�t expected the response, �List Mode. Your search has found 124
entries. These are listed below by name. To select an alternative order click
here. To refine your search please return to the previous page. To see this
search in display mode click here. To save these search criteria in My Searches
click here.� Beneath the text at the top of the screen was a long list of
names. I scrolled down. Sure enough there was �Hales, Rebecca�. I clicked on
the link up came a page with Rebecca�s details and a photograph which looked as
though it had come from her Atlantic Airlines personnel file. Under
�Employment� it said; �Last known employer 01/06 :
Atlantic Airlines�. I went back to the previous page and tried clicking on
�Display Mode�. The same list appeared but now with a short summary of each
person and a thumbnail picture alongside.

&nbsp;

�Extraordinary!� I exclaimed, �how can you possibly have all those on file?�

&nbsp;

Seb grinned. �Tell him Jacqueline,� he said. �This has been your
contribution.�

&nbsp;

Jackie turned around in her chair. �The
data comes from a number of sources. We haven�t built a database here. We plant
a small programme, a virus I guess you�d call it, on the servers of certain
companies. Then when we do a search we poll each of those servers. Our virus
does a search on that database and sends the results back. The system at this
end collates the results, combines data for similar looking responses and presents
it to the user. Easy.�

&nbsp;

�Easy,� I said. �But what are the target
systems? I still don�t understand how you�re getting the data.�

&nbsp;

Seb butted in. �Come on,� he said, �you used to be in the software
business. What proportion of companies uses standard software packages?�

&nbsp;

�Pretty much all of them these days, I
guess. For some parts of business people still develop their own programmes but
generally it�s not worth while.�

&nbsp;

�So for personnel, HR,
say?�

&nbsp;

�No, you wouldn�t bother developing
something customised. It�s going to be far cheaper to buy a package or use a
service.�

&nbsp;

�Exactly. So what we�ve done is to develop a virus that works with the five
or six HR database packages that make up about 90% of the installed systems.
Then Jackie here has managed to load that virus on virtually all of the major
temp and executive placement agencies and a few of the major employers too. We
reckon we can get access to around 250,000 records relating to women between
the ages of 18 and 40 say; anyone who is on their books or has applied for a
job via an agency. They�re supposed to clean off old data but none of them do.�

&nbsp;

�But the photographs?�

&nbsp;

�They all do that now. Take a digital photo
at the interview, stick it on the file. We strip the photo out just like any
other data. The systems ought to have sufficient security to stop anything like
this but most of these guys have pretty sloppy security and even the people
that do have good systems � the banks say � their focus is on keeping you out
of financial applications not the HR stuff.�

&nbsp;

�And as long as their security doesn�t spot
us we can go on querying their data.�

&nbsp;

�That�s it. And actually what we do is to
keep a copy of the results for each query so that even if a system does go
off-line in the future we�ll have built up a lot of data of our own.�

&nbsp;

�Fantastic! The customer gets to choose
from an enormous shopping list and we got quite a lot of data on which to go
back to them with a quote to collect and supply quite quickly. We shouldn�t
need to collect speculatively for auction at all.�

&nbsp;

I was really pleased with the work that
Sebastian and his team had done. I wanted to check it out with some customers,
of course but it looked to me like we had a solid basis for a really innovative
approach. 

&nbsp;

I went back to town to try and catch
Freddie. I certainly wanted his OK before talking to any of the existing
customers and besides I hoped he would help out at the event I had in mind. I
was sat in my office starting to sketch out the programme when a knock at the
door disturbed me. I looked up.

&nbsp;

Normally the arrival in my office of a
raven haired, blue eyed, woman with legs up to her
armpits and a suit with tailoring so sharp you could cut yourself on it would
be greeted with considerable enthusiasm. On this occasion, though, my pleasure
was tempered by wariness. This was Ellie, Elspeth Grant � the head of Clegg�s
legal department and according to most office gossip, Clegg�s long term partner
in matters carnal.� In fact, as far as I
knew, she was Clegg�s only interest outside of his work. As a legal eagle she
had a lot going for her, fine feathers and the sharpest of talons. 

&nbsp;

�Mr Ross,� she said extending a perfectly
manicured hand towards me. 

&nbsp;

I reached forward and shook it carefully.
Someone had advised me once to count my fingers after shaking hands with a
lawyer; from what I�d heard about Elly I shouldn�t
make an exception for her. �Indeed,� I said. �What can I do for you, Ms Grant?�
I was hoping she wasn�t about to basll me out for
setting Freddie up with Angie Dennison.

&nbsp;

�Oh, please, it�s Ellie,� she smiled. I
wasn�t sure whether I needed to be encouraged by the familiarity or not.
�Freddie suggested I had a word with you.�

&nbsp;

�Fine,� I said, still wary. �Take a seat.�

&nbsp;

She sat down in one of the chairs beside
the coffee table. �I thought you ought to get a briefing on what we do in
Legal,� she said. �After all, I can imagine that some of things you�re doing
might need our help.�

&nbsp;

�Fair enough,� I said, �I hadn�t really
thought about it. I guess that since to the best of my knowledge most of what
we do is outside the law, your team�s main job was keeping the law out of
everybody�s way.�

&nbsp;

Ellie smiled tolerantly. �Well, there is
that,� she said. �I do have a small team of girls to keep some of those who
might cause us problems �on side� so to speak. You needn�t worry about that
though. Just think about it as part of FCE�s central
services � canteen, mail room, photocopying, girls to shag the commissioner of
police � it�s all the same thing.�

&nbsp;

�You sound like you don�t feel appreciated.�

&nbsp;

�Hmm, maybe,� she smiled,
surprised that anyone should seem sympathetic. �You�re right, though. Freddie�s
always been supportive but I don�t think many people see the value of what we
do. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about contracts.�

&nbsp;

�For the girls?�

&nbsp;

Ellie laughed. �Oh no, of
course not. They�d have no standing in English law. You can�t make a
contract under duress and I fear that most of our products are under duress in
one way or another. We do have some legal cover in that area. It�s all a little
complicated; there were some oversights when the anti-slavery acts were passed
in the nineteenth century but I won�t bore you with that. I�m not sure how well
it would play in the courts if it came to it. We ought to win in the Crown
Court, the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords here but if the European
Court of Human Rights stuck its oar in then I think we�d have difficulty. No,
we�re better off steering clear of contracts for the girls, I�d say.�

&nbsp;

I must have looked relieved. I was. She
went on, �It�s contracts for the clients that I�m concerned about. We have a
standard sale agreement that covers purchase at auction, warranties, transfer
of entitlement to goods, payment terms, standard disclaimers, that sort of
thing. The Sale of Goods Act 1979 and the Sale and Supply of
Goods to Consumers regulations 2002 apply, you see. Goods have to be &quot;as
described&quot; and �of merchantable quality and fit for the purpose they are
intended for�. That�s usually OK, Harry and Rick take a lot of trouble to make
sure the end product is as expected and as long as we don�t get too carried
away with the descriptions in the catalogues we are fine. For buyers at auction
it�s only different if the goods are second hand.
I�m not sure how it would relate to some of the things
you�re planning with the account management programme though.�

&nbsp;

I must have looked puzzled. �I�m not sure I
see how it�s different,� I said. �We just end up with a sale at the end, same
as at auction legally, I�d have thought. What sort of thing are you worried
about?�

&nbsp;

�There has to be a question of title to the
goods in the period between collection and transfer to the client. Normally
title remains with us to the point of auction but where a client is
commissioning a collection � that�s your usual model isn�t it?� 

&nbsp;

I nodded. �Pretty much
from a legal point of view.�

&nbsp;

�Where the client is commissioning we
should be careful to have a service contract that covers the research and
collection phases. We�d want to ensure that any costs incurred are recoverable
in the event of the client deciding not to proceed and that title remains with
us until the client takes delivery and concludes a final sale agreement.�

&nbsp;

�Sounds reasonable. Do we need one of those every time we engage with a client?�

&nbsp;

�No, that�s not necessary. We could come up
with a standard managed account agreement if you like. Then we can simply add
schedules to it covering individual projects, the specification of the product
involved, agreed pre-collection activities and so on.�

&nbsp;

�Sounds reasonable. We could add something similar to the website user�s agreement too.
Not that anyone ever reads them!�

&nbsp;

�None the less binding!� she said with a
grin. �Harry�s team may like cable ties, rope and straps but I�ll stick with
contracts.� She got to her feet, looking at her watch. �Well thank you for that
Larry,� she said, bringing our discussion to a close abruptly. �I�ll drop you a
note on the things we need to do. Freddie said you�d be all right about it.
Thanks.�

&nbsp;

And with that she left. I still had all my
fingers. I thought it had gone all right.

&nbsp;

I went down to see Rachel. She�d done a
good job with the video and I thought that she deserved a thank you at the very
least. I�d kept my part of the bargain and told the guards she was off-limits.
She�d kept hers. No more stupid escape attempts and the script she had produced
was fine. I opened the door to her cell. She looked up
at me from her seat beside the table we had given her for her computer. Mind
you the table was bolted down. So was the computer. A light chain ran from her
ankle to a ring in the wall. The guards have given her some clothes, a loose
sweater and a skirt. They hadn�t let her have any shoes. She still wore her
collar but she wasn�t gagged. Even so, she didn�t say anything. Most of her cuts
and bruises had healed up, but she didn�t look great.

&nbsp;

�I came to say thanks for the script,� I
said. �It worked well.�

&nbsp;

�Terrific,� she replied sullenly. �What
happens to me now? Is this when you come to collect? Or do I just get put back
on the available list again and sold off when someone comes along and asks for
a piece of meat that can spell properly?� She was staring down at the table.

&nbsp;

I sat down at the other side of the table
facing her. �I need some more stuff written,� I said.

&nbsp;

She looked up, tired, desolate and silent.

&nbsp;

�I need a brochure and some case studies.
How we�ve helped our clients that sort of thing.�

&nbsp;

�Fuck off,� she said. �Why should I help
you? Why make it more likely that you�ll trap more girls like me?�

&nbsp;

�Because you�re here. And the alternatives aren�t good.�

&nbsp;

�Fuck off.�

&nbsp;

I looked across at her. She was staring
down at the keyboard of the computer. It wasn�t going to work, I decided. She�d
been broken down by the rapes but there hadn�t been anything put in its place.
I�d spoken to Rick before I came to see her. He thought he might be able to do
sufficient orientation on her to fix things. Enough to get
her compliant but still able to write. I�d hoped that I wouldn�t have to
put her through it but I could see that she wasn�t about to become more pliant
without a lot of work by someone; and at least Rick�s team was trained to do
it. I got up and walked to the door. Two of the guards were waiting. I beckoned
them in. Rachel looked up terrified that she was about to be raped again. She wasn�t.
It would be much worse than that.

&nbsp;

�Sorry Rachel,� I said to her; and then, to
the Guards, �Take her down to Orientation. There�s a programme set up for her.�

&nbsp;

The taller of the two guards grabbed her by
the arms and pulled her to her feet. He jerked her wrists upwards and over her
head to fasten her wrist cuffs to the back of her neck collar. The other wedged
a gag into her mouth before she could protest.��� They unfastened her ankle chain from the
ring in the wall and hustled her, struggling against them, out of the cell. I
wouldn�t be seeing her for a while.

&nbsp;

Chapter 25: Quest for
the Questors

&nbsp;

�The question is,
can you do it?�� 

&nbsp;

Word, it seemed was getting around about
the willingness of Clegg Enterprises to take on apparently difficult projects.� Peter Hananni was
the latest of a series of individuals that had appeared with a range of
challenges to Clegg�s research and snatch teams.

&nbsp;

�I was put on to you by a mutual friend. The Kalinin of Kushtia? He indicated that you
had been able to help him out with some of his requirements.�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� I said. �The Kalinin is a valued
client of ours. I am pleased he speaks well of us. He said you would call.� I
wasn�t clear how Hananni and the Kalinin were
connected. Hananni looked to be of north
African origin, Egyptian or Libyan possibly, I thought. He sported a style in
dress and personal jewellery that left no one in doubt of the material success
his business endeavours had achieved.

&nbsp;

�He does indeed but as I said, the question
is, can you do this?� He smiled. He had almost as much gold in his mouth as on
his knuckles.

&nbsp;

�Well, Mr Hananni,
I won�t give you an answer off the cuff. Give me a week and I�ll come back to
you with a proposal or a no-can-do. I am sure you realise that this is going to
need some level of ingenuity to execute.�

&nbsp;

�Of course, Mr Ross,� said Hananni, disarmingly, �That�s why the Kalinin suggested I
talk to you. And why Mr Ross, I am most keen that you should handle this
personally.� 

&nbsp;

�This� was on the face of it a fairly
demanding project. Hananni had a new business venture
in hand; a game in which players gambled on the one to emerge victorious from a
labyrinth of problems, dangers and other competitors. The game would be staged
on a remote island. The competition was to be based on a popular computer game
in which four buxom adventuresses strive to find the fabled Jewels of
Nefertiti. My client�s request was quite simple he wanted us to supply the
Jewel Questors; the actual Jewel Questors;
the characters that the game was based on. 

&nbsp;

The only problem was that, for the first
time since I�d joined Clegg, the Research team had drawn a blank.

&nbsp;

Derek Johnson in the Research Centre was
looking glum. �Larry, I�d like to help but I don�t see how we can. I�ll tell
you what we�ve got but it isn�t much.�

&nbsp;

I wasn�t that happy with the prospect of
going back to the client and saying �no can do� but I let him go on.

&nbsp;

�Jewel Questors
is developed and published by NRT Games. They�re a British company and their
development takes place here in the UK.
They�ve controlled the franchise very tightly, hardly any merchandising of the
characters, no spin offs at all. If you want to get into the game, you have to
buy the game. It�s been the most successful NRT product but Jewel Questors III � The Amarna Ring
didn�t get the greatest of reviews. Their competitive edge was that they use
very accurate physical modelling for the animation and personality modelling
for the interactions and responses and they did this by using four real
individuals as the basis for their programming. I understand that it is these
individuals that your client is keen to acquire?�

&nbsp;

I nodded.

&nbsp;

�The problem is that no-one know exactly
who they are. The legends on the message boards say that they are NRT employees
who were working in their development team when the game was devised. It�s also
reckoned that the company paid to have breast augmentation surgery so that they
would better match the interests of the game�s target players.�

&nbsp;

�Adolescent males of any
age?�

&nbsp;

�Uh huh.� So the four women that are
used to model the game characters and who do the very, very few, personal
appearances have never spoken publicly and we haven�t been able to find out who
they are. We�ve been watching the company offices but seen no sign of them�

&nbsp;

�So is there anything known on the company
that would help?�

&nbsp;

�Not much. It�s a private limited company
so they don�t have to give out much apart from publishing accounts which don�t
really tell us much. All we do know is that the second largest, shareholder,
one of the founders and the Development Director is this lady.� He tossed a
grainy photograph, obviously a blow up from a telephoto shot, across the desk.
�Helen Stanhope, 43 and as far as we can tell the only person that has direct
involvement with the Questors. She�s there at any
event where the Questors do appear and it�s only ever
her that�s there from the company.�

&nbsp;

�OK, maybe some sort of in, there.�

&nbsp;

�Well maybe, but she�s going to be
difficult to get at. She�s more of a geek than her team is. Home � work � home;
lives in an apartment in an old mansion that�s been renovated, trouble is the
place is stiff with CCTV � and yes we�ve seen if we can crack it and the answer
is no � and security. Seems like she�s one nervous lady.
But maybe that�s what working on these games does for you.�

&nbsp;

It wasn�t looking hopeful. I was groping
around for some leverage. �Husband? Boyfriend?
Girlfriend? Kids? Aged aunt?�

&nbsp;

�Not that we�ve found. She divorced about
twenty years ago, no kids; parents died about five years back in a car crash;
doesn�t look like she has a social life outside the office or inside it
either.� I was feeling glummer by the minute. �There is however, this.� He
tossed me another photo.

&nbsp;

The woman in the picture was in her mid
twenties. She looked like a younger version of Helen. �Sister?�
I said.

&nbsp;

�Yeah,� said Derek. �Andromeda
Stanhope.�

&nbsp;

�Andromeda? What was with their parents? Too many holidays in
Greece?�

&nbsp;

�There are some limits even to the
capabilities of the Research Team, Ross,� said Derek, investing his remarks
with all the pomposity of Q admonishing James Bond. But then he grinned. �We�ve
no idea. But it would appear that younger sister is both accessible and a
potential lever. She and big sis don�t meet up much but they do exchange emails
every day, sometimes four of five times a day.�

&nbsp;

�Is that healthy?�

&nbsp;

�Who knows but it could mean that if
anything untoward were to happen to little sister then big sister might be
willing to help us to get access to the Questors.
It�s about the only shot we�ve found so far.�

&nbsp;

�Well we only need one. Do you want to do a
bit more research on Andromeda, talk it though with Operations and work up a
collection proposal. If we can invite young Andromeda
around to a rock that she can be chained to then I�ll be happy to have a chat
with Helen and see if she can launch four Questors in
our direction even if she can�t manage a thousand ships.�

�

It was less than a week later when I had
the chance to talk to Helen Stanhope. It was a pleasant day and we�d agreed to
meet by the lake in St James� Park. I was sitting on a bench at the agreed time
when I saw Helen walking towards me along the path by the edge of the lake
coming from Horse Guards Parade. She sat down on the bench beside me. I could
tell she wasn�t happy with having to be there. I was pleased to see her,
especially after she�d been so rude when I first phoned her. �Absolutely not,�
she�d said, �Nobody gets to meet the Questors,
especially right now. I don�t care how big your sponsorship offer is, we�re not
meeting with anyone until after Jewel Questors IV is
locked down and even then I�ll need something more convincing than some half
arsed co-marketing idea to get interested. Call me back when your brain gets as
big as your dick obviously is.� 

&nbsp;

Mind you that was before we sent her the
emails showing her sister naked and in chains. I thought that the guys in the
Prep Centre had done a creditable job of reproducing the scene from Jewell Questors II where the Questors
have to free a hostage from a chamber in an underground tomb. I mean she was
still pretty foul-mouthed about it all but this time she agreed to meet
me.� 

&nbsp;

�Good morning, Helen,� I said. She scowled
back but said nothing. �I thought we might talk about happy families.� Still nothing. �How, let�s say, one sister has all the
business skills but another one has all the ideas, all the stories, all the
scenarios. How one is happy to plod away at a job but the other wants nothing
to do with work. How one is currently enjoying the morning sunshine in St James
Park while the other is in, shall we say, less salubrious surroundings.�

&nbsp;

�Is she safe?� it wasn�t much of a
conversation but at least it was something. She was looking straight through
me.

&nbsp;

I nodded. �And she can stay that way.�

&nbsp;

�What do you want? Money, I suppose. It�s
usually money?� She was getting more talkative.

&nbsp;

�Well, surprisingly it�s not that. It�s
just that, well, I�m a terrific fan of the game. Always have been, ever since
Jewell Questors � The Golden Ankh, and I�ve always
wanted to meet the Questors.�

&nbsp;

�Nobody meets the Questors.�
She cut in automatically but then stopped herself. �You kidnapped my sister so
you could meet the Questors?�

&nbsp;

�Kidnapped is a horrible word. I�d prefer
to say she�s a house guest.�

&nbsp;

�It didn�t look like she was really able to
leave even if she wanted to from the pictures you sent me, you arsehole.�

&nbsp;

I ignored the abuse. �Ah. Well, I hope you
didn�t mind me using your sister�s email account to send those. It seemed the
best way to make sure you read them. I�m sure you must get a lot of emails from
all sorts of lunatics.�

&nbsp;

�All sorts of other
lunatics.�

&nbsp;

�That�s rather unkind but I�ll ignore it.
So when can we arrange my meeting with the Questors?�

&nbsp;

�You�re assuming a lot.�

&nbsp;

�Well, that�s what us
lunatics are like but it doesn�t seem much to ask. You set up for me to meet
with the Questors. Just me and the
four of them and you too if you like. Just so I can see them in the
flesh as it were. Well in character at least,� I smiled. �Then I can achieve my
ambition and you can have your sister back. And then she�ll be able to let you
have all the interesting scenarios she�s been thinking about for Jewel Questors IV. Some of it sounds very exciting. I�m really
looking forward to it already. Oh, and of course that might help the IPO you�ve
got planned. I can�t imagine that your prospective investors will be
frightfully keen to discover that the creative energies of the company aren�t
actually employed by it.�

&nbsp;

�How do I know you will do as you say?�

&nbsp;

�If you let me get to see the Questors then you and her get back together and I get to
see part IV when it�s developed and NRT Games get to carry on. If you don�t
then she�ll stay with me until she runs out of stories to tell � a bit like Scherezade � and by then I�m not sure if it will matter;
NRT Games will have run out of time and, I suspect, money.�

&nbsp;

�How do I know she�s safe?�

&nbsp;

�I brought you a present.� I reached into
my pocket and pulled out a black iPod. �You�ll find
some video to watch on there. I took it while she was watching the news this
morning. The picture�s not great but it should be some comfort to you. I�d
really like this not to be the last you see of your sister.�

&nbsp;

She slipped the iPod
into her handbag. �What do you want me to do?� she asked in resignation.

&nbsp;

�I�ll let you know,� I said. �I�ll drop you
an email. Might even send you some more video for the iPod. Just set things up so you can get the Questors to turn up. I�ll leave you to work out how to do
it. Anyway, I must be off now; better make sure my house guest is still all
right. I�m never sure if there�s really enough oxygen in those little boxes.�

&nbsp;

Helen whimpered as I got up to leave.
�Don�t worry,� I said as I walked away. �I�ll make sure that you and your
sister get back together. See you soon

Chapter 26 : Web In Focus

&nbsp;

We were in Freddie�s club, expecting a
dozen or so clients to turn up. I wanted to give them a briefing on the new web
services to get some feed-back.

&nbsp;

I had a good session with Clegg before the
clients turned up. We�d run through the arrangements for the day and he seemed
very happy with the plans. �I like this idea of getting feed-back from the
clients,� he said. �We could spend a lot of money without having a solid
foundation, otherwise.�

&nbsp;

I thought I�d take the opportunity to raise
one of my concerns. �You�re right,� I said. �I really want to find a way of
getting better insights into the client�s minds to help strengthen the account
management approach alongside this. It�s a big problem � I just suspect that
it�s one of those areas where they won�t realise if you�re doing a good job but
they�ll soon complain if you�re doing a bad one.�

&nbsp;

�Hmm, maybe,� said Clegg. �Of course some
of the merchandise must get a pretty good insight into their owners over time. Only problem is we don�t see many of them back through our hands.
And I draw the line at kidnapping our client�s property! Still if you have
another idea, let me know. Things seem to be going the right way and we need to
make sure that we keep this on track.� We broke off our conversation as the
first of the clients started to appear. Clegg was at his best greeting them,
sliding from one to another, making all feel equally valued. Eventually all
twelve had arrived and we got them sat down in the presentation area. Some of
our clients were travelling with slaves and had brought them along. I wasn�t
keen that the slaves heard what we had to say so we�d come up with the idea of
allowing them to remain but having them ear-plugged and hooded, We�d provided
the hoods as the clients arrived; soft black leather to cover the eyes, the
ears and the back of the head, back laced to allow for long hair. The hoods
left the mouth free � we knew that many of the clients would have their slaves
gagged anyway. Each hood carried a Clegg Enterprises logo worked into the buckle of the strap that ran around the slave�s neck to
keep the hood in place. A nice memento, I thought.

&nbsp;

�Good morning, ladies &amp; gentlemen, welcome to the club here and thank you for coming
along today,� Freddie said, greeting the clients we had invited to preview the
efforts of Sebastian�s team. I was pleased that he felt ready to front it; it
was all a bit of an innovation after all. He�d been happy to invite folk too,
putting a squeeze on them to free up some time in their busy lives. �I know you
have all been interested to learn what we have been doing to improve our sales
approach, so I am very happy to introduce our Marketing Director, Larry Ross.
Some of you I know have met Larry all ready and I hope you�ll agree with me
that he�s bringing a whole lot of valuable new ideas to Clegg Enterprises,
ideas that I think you�ll find interesting. We�ve asked you here today to
preview a new service that we are about to launch. We�ve spoken to people about
different parts of it but this is the first time any of our clients have had
the chance to see the whole thing in action. We are really anxious to get your
feed-back on this. I can�t stress enough how much we want to fit this service
to what our clients want, so please be as open as you like on what we have
done. Still, enough from me. Here�s Larry.�

&nbsp;

Clegg sat down to polite applause and I
took the stage. We�d agreed to make the whole presentation very factual, very
professional. Brian had wanted us to field some of his latest acquisitions as
evidence of what we could do but I didn�t want anything that would detract from
the systems. Fortunately Freddie had agreed with me. I looked out at the
audience. They looked as though they were ready to give us a hearing at least.
At the back of the room four hooded women stood, shackled and silent.

&nbsp;

I started off with a short presentation
summarising some of the things that I felt we�d not been good at previously,
particularly the whole thing around not responding to customer needs. I gave
them a short case study on the way we were becoming more interactive; using the
project that we�d done for the Kalinin�s son. If nothing else I thought it might help drum up some more
custom acquisition work that way and some of them might see the value of
putting enough business our way to warrant becoming an account managed client.
They seemed quietly impressed. I went on. �The real purpose of today, though,
is to show you the proposed web service. This will be available to all of our
clients and I think it offers many features that you will find useful and that
aren�t offered by any of our competitors. It�s got three main aims; to help our
customer select potential acquisitions, to track any projects that you might
engage us for and to participate in auctions without having to trek up to our
sales centre. Of course you�ll still be welcome if you want to come in person
but we believe that many of our clients are busy people and find it
increasingly difficult to justify the time to visit auctions unless there is a
very special item available.�

&nbsp;

I could see that the audience was still
interested but I felt that if I didn�t get down to the nitty-gritty pretty
quickly they would start to get restless. I�d arranged for a PC to be hooked up
to a projector. One of Sebastian�s team of young ladies was back stage pressing
the buttons. I talked them through the features of the system. The News and
Catalogue areas were greeted with luke-warm
enthusiasm, although there was some interest at some of the items of stock on
display. Attention picked up though when I started to explain the �My Projects�
area and interest turned to enthusiasm as I began to run through the �Search
&amp; Snatch� service. By the time I asked for questions at the end most of the
audience were looking keen.

&nbsp;

Inevitably at such an event there were few
questions in the open forum, most people wanted to talk one-to-one. Clegg,
Sebastian, Harry and Brian were all on hand to chat
people through what we were aiming to do. Clegg had got the club to lay on some
drinks and snacks. It was a novelty to be served by women that weren�t chained
and gagged. We�d got an information pack together for each of the attendees
with a security fob that gave access to the service and a set of simple
instructions. We�d also included a discount offer for the first live auction
that we had planned for later that month. I�d figured that anything we offered
off the top would be offset by higher prices resulting from more bidders, so
the whole thing should be self funding. Clegg had agreed � he liked the idea of
giveaways that didn�t cost anything. Brian had just seemed disagreeable about
the whole thing. Just to make the most of it I�d arranged with Rick to have
five of the auction lots shipped down and put on display in cages in the room
where we were serving the drinks. They weren�t very far on in Orientation yet
so we�d had to make sure they were well shackled. Even so some of them were
trying to rattle the bars in protest at being put on show. I was pleased by how
quiet Rick had managed to keep them. He�d shown me a new gag that some of the
guys in technical had been working on; a heavy leather, padded face piece
coupled with a mouth filling plug stuffed with a gel that expanded slightly as
it warmed. That way the plug swelled up once it was pushed into the slaves mouth. Small tubes allowed cold water to be run
through the gel to shrink it when the gag needed to be removed. It wasn�t
pretty but at least it let us talk to our guests without too much disturbance
from the exhibits and some of them were expressing interest in the gags as much
as in the women that were wearing them. I made a mental note to think about
whether Clegg Enterprises should consider going into the business of branded
restraints.

&nbsp;

I spent some time talking with Steve Glennis. He confirmed that what we were doing was well
ahead of anything he�d seen from the American agencies and he thought he�d be
able to use it for future acquisitions for his stables. I asked him about Sukie; if she�d been sold yet.

&nbsp;

�No,� said Steve, �she�s with me now � at
the back there.� He nodded his head to the back of the room where the four
hooded slaves stood patiently. I hadn�t recognised her at first but I could see
that the girl second from the left, in black polo jumper and slacks, could well
be Sukie. �She still doesn�t know that I intend to
sell her on. I�d hoped I might find some interest on this trip from some of my
contacts but no luck.�

&nbsp;

I thought back to the conversation I�d had
with Clegg. �Suppose we took her off your hands as a sort of down payment
against a future project?� I said. �It�s not what we�d normally do but you
obviously won�t be wanting to cart her back to the
island. We�d be happy to take her on account, so to speak and credit you with
her resale value when we deliver the next piece of merchandise you take from
us.� I was on fairly safe grounds, I thought. Sukie
was eminently resaleable, and Glennis
hadn�t bought anything from us for ages, so if this got him started spending
with us again it would be a double bonus. Besides, Sukie
was a bright girl. She�d give me plenty of useful insights into slave owners �
from our conversations on the island there had been at least four or five
others that she had been leant out to during her time with Glennis.

&nbsp;

Steve looked a bit sceptical at first but
then warmed to the idea. �All right,� he said. �Have one of your legal team run
up an agreement. You might as well take her now though,� he said, leading the
way across to the hooded, gagged and deafened form of Sukie.
He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small fob on a ring. I recognised
it as a USB pen drive. �All her documentation is on
here,� he said, clipping the fob to a ring on the girl�s hood. �Let me know if
there�s anything else you need.� He ran his hand down her back and patted her
backside. She gave a puzzled grunt through her gag, unaware of anything that
had been said. Steve smiled and shook my hand before apologising that he had to
leave. Sukie never saw him again.

&nbsp;

Brian had been cornered by Daphne Challis,
the dumpy woman I had last seen on the flight back from Steve�s island. She was
standing closer to him than he felt comfortable with. I had some sympathy with
him, I could tell from where I was standing, twenty feet away, that her
personal hygiene hadn�t improved any since the flight. Clegg was doing the
rounds of his old pals, beaming effusively and enthusing about the work that
Sebastian had done. Seb himself was being engaged by
several of the audience who were keen to see how things worked close up. We
were all being fairly tight-lipped about how we did the Search &amp; Snatch
thing. No point in making things easier for the competition than we needed to.

&nbsp;

Freddie came up to me afterwards in as
cheery a mood as ever, evidently well pleased with the day�s proceedings. Brian
was being unenthusiastic. �Why on earth did you get me stuck with that Challis
woman?� he complained. �And I don�t see how this can substitute for proper
selling,� he said. �No real contact with people. I think you�re on the wrong
track Ross.�

&nbsp;

I started to defend my approach. �We�ll
see,� I said, �people seemed interested today at least.�

&nbsp;

�Interest is one thing, sales is another,�
said Brian.

&nbsp;

�Yes,� said Clegg, �quite right. I want to
talk to you about that Brian. Can you run me through the numbers from the last
auction? I don�t think we�re seeing the improvements you hoped for yet are we?�

&nbsp;

Brian looked even more uncomfortable than
he had when Daphne had sidled up alongside him. Clegg steered him away as Brian
glowered over his shoulder at me.

&nbsp;

�Had a good day?�

&nbsp;

I jerked around, startled by the sudden
words. Elly, elegant as ever, had slid silently up
behind me. �I think so. The feed-back has been good.�

&nbsp;

�Freddie was looking forward to this. I
think he�s pleased. He�s been quite the happy bunny lately, first the Dennison
woman and now this.�

&nbsp;

�Brian wasn�t too impressed.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, I shouldn�t worry about that, if I
were you,� Elly encouraged, �I think he�s feeling a
bit insecure at the moment. Not quite on top of his game as Freddie might say.�

&nbsp;

Something told me that was exactly what
Freddie would say and presumably had been saying. �I needed to talk to you,� I
said and explained about Sukie and the scheme with
Steve Glennis.

&nbsp;

Elly looked sanguine about it. �I�d rather you�d consulted me first,� she said, in a carefully
measured tone that left no doubt about what I should do next time, �but it
sounds all right. I can get an agreement drafted for Glennis, best keep it all
above board, less danger of confusion and fallings out down stream that way. A
Clegg Enterprises hire and agency agreement should cover it. We can add your
credit arrangement as an annex to the main contract.�

Chapter 27:The Abduction of Helen

&nbsp;

With the web site launch done, I had some
time to devote to the Questor�s project. I know I
shouldn�t really go on operations but it�s hard to resist the adrenalin rush
and besides, Freddie and Harry both seemed happy that I was getting involved. �Just
as long as there are no vodka bottles around,� said Harry with a smirk. Plus,
of course, Hannani had been keen for me to handle
things personally and the customer is always right.

&nbsp;

I�ve always liked the Ashmolean Museum. Not a lot of people go to visit it. It�s in Oxford and most
people go to visit the colleges but the Ashmolean is
like a jewel box. It�s extraordinary really � one building with the whole of
mankind�s history on display. Plus it was founded by a man who basically stole
the original collection from the man who set up the first ever public museum in
Britain. The handy thing is that they are always ready to open it up after
hours for corporate hospitality events.�
They were really cooperative when I asked if I could hire the Egyptian
Gallery to impress a few clients and perfectly happy for me to organise my own
caterers; just as long as I didn�t break anything, they�d said with a smile.

&nbsp;

I was sitting in the Morse Bar of the
Randolph Hotel opposite the museum, looking out across Beaumont Street
when I saw the cab pull up. Three women got out � Helen Stanhope and two others
that I took to be two of the Questors. I was pleased, she was on time and obviously doing as she had been
told. There was no sign that she�d brought any help but the snatch crew would
be looking out for that. I saw two other women walking up Beaumont Street,
waving to her. That made the full set as far as I was concerned. I watched as
they went up the steps into the courtyard and towards the museum entrance. I
left them for a few minutes to get settled and followed them in.

&nbsp;

I found them as I expected in the Egyptian
Gallery. The women had all taken off their coats and were standing, drinks in
hand, admiring the exhibits. They were being served by two waitresses, both
dressed in the usual black dresses with white aprons and caps. One held a tray
of drinks, the other, Tricia, a tray of canap�s. I was beginning to enjoy it
when Tricia turned up on a job. She certainly looked good in the uniform.

&nbsp;

Helen scowled as I entered first of all,
but then managed an insincere smile. �Well, hello,� she said, sourly. �We were
beginning to wonder if you were going to come.�

&nbsp;

I gave Helen an equally insincere embrace
of greeting. �Goodness, I wouldn�t have missed this Helen,� I said. �It�s so
good of you to arrange it. And these are the Questors.
Wonderful. Ladies, it�s a great pleasure to meet you
and in such appropriate surroundings too.� 

&nbsp;

That bit at least was honest. The extent to
which the computer game characters resembled their originals (or vice versa)
was remarkable. I�d spent some time playing the game � purely as part of the
project, you understand � and the four Questors in
the game were only slightly exaggerated versions of the real things. There was
Anya Tanith, archaeologist and fortune hunter, bush
shirt tied off under her tits and khaki shorts that looked like they had been
spray painted on; beside her was Dr. Elspeth Train, the linguist and scholar in
her trademark dark tweed jacket, tight black skirt and half-moon, gold rimmed
spectacles. Between these two and Helen were the black jump-suit clad Aniko Tomaka � the all-action
heroine - and Caressa Santango,
the fiery, Latin, intuitive one of the four, in a scarlet dress that was cut
every bit as low as those she wore in the game. For what it was worth, I
reckoned that all four of these ladies had been surgically enhanced so that
their attributes provided the desired look when animated.� They didn�t say anything, they just smiled. I
wondered what Helen had told them about our meeting.

&nbsp;

Helen wheeled out a suitcase. �I brought
the clothes you asked for,� she said with an air of distaste. �One costume for each of the characters.�

&nbsp;

�Thank you,� I said, �a wonderful souvenir.�

&nbsp;

�A gift for a pervert, if you ask me,� she
hissed under her breath. I smiled. Still Helen had certainly delivered her side
of the bargain. It was just a shame that I wasn�t really going to be able to do
the same or at least, not in the way that Helen imagined.

&nbsp;

�Would you like some wine, Sir,� the
waitress with the drinks tray said to me.

&nbsp;

�I�d rather have a scotch if you can manage
it,� I answered giving the girl the signal to start. I looked up at the CCTV
camera that covered the gallery. The techies would have it on divert by now.

&nbsp;

�Of course, Sir,� she said putting down her
tray of drinks. Tricia did the same with her canap�s. The first waitress
reached behind a statue of Ahkenaten and pulled out a
pistol, a second later she had her arm around Helen�s throat and the gun
pointing at her temple. As she did so, Tricia grabbed an Ouzi
from inside a canopic chest and was pointing it at
the other four. �Nice and calm, ladies, please,� she said politely. �Just
remember there aren�t any cheats for extra lives in this game.� 

&nbsp;

Helen was looking furious and was about to
speak when her captor jerked her arm more tightly about her throat and jammed
the barrel of the gun harder against her head. �Not interested, sister,� she
said. �Lots of quiet is what is needed. You others,�
she barked at the four Questors staring on in
disbelief. �Grab a napkin each, from the table there
and push it into your mouth as far as it will go. Then put your hands up way over
your heads and get over facing that wall. Get on with it! Are you waiting for
me to press CTRL-SHIFT-Get The Fuck Over By The Wall
or something?�

&nbsp;

I watched as the four girls did as they were
told. Tricia and her Ouzi went over, She made sure each got a good prod in the ribs from the gun
just to reinforce the situation and then frisked each of them in turn, removing
Anya�s bowie knife, and Aniko�s throwing knives - one
of the benefits of the games was that we knew what to look for. 

&nbsp;

�OK, ladies, turn
around but keep your hands up please.� The four of them turned around each with
a wad of white napkin spilling from their well stuffed mouths. I walked along
the line strapping the napkins in place with a couple of strips of tape for each.
I took a napkin for Helen and gave her the same treatment. �Very good,� Helen�s
waitress said. �Now round again and hands behind your back, please.� The
waitresses had brought plenty of rope with them so it was easy for me to get
their wrists tied and then to put a turn or two between their elbows and around
their chest. Helen was dealt with in the same way as the others.

&nbsp;

�Thanks a lot girls,�
I said to the waitresses. �You can clear away now and make sure they�re all
bagged up. We haven�t got time to strip them now and I don�t want those
costumes messed up on the journey. Here, take this case too.� I pushed across
the suitcase that Helen had brought. The four Questors
and Helen were hustled away at gunpoint, out through the kitchens and into the
catering van that the waitresses had come in. Helen�s waitress came back to
pick up the glasses, the plates and the remains of the food and drink. I knew
they�d be out and on their way to the Prep Centre in minutes.

&nbsp;

I went to find the museum�s curator to let
him know that my hospitality event was over. He seemed happy. �Just as long as
you didn�t break anything,� he said with a grin.

&nbsp;

�No, no,� I replied, �though
of course we did steal a few priceless items.�

&nbsp;

He laughed in response. �I�ll enjoy
watching that on the replays,� he said nodding to the security monitors.
�Well,� he said, �I hope your clients enjoyed themselves.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, yes,� I answered, �they were quite
taken with the place.�

&nbsp;

I passed the catering van as they reached Warwick on the M40
going north. I was back at the Prep Centre before they were.

&nbsp;

I was waiting for them when the catering
van backed up to the loading dock. When we opened the doors at the back of the
van I was pleased to see that Tricia and her pal had done just as I asked. 

&nbsp;

The four Questors
had been bagged in zip-up nylon bags that closed up to their necks. It was just
as well for their outfits, a couple of trays of food
from the buffet had tipped over during the trip and spread themselves around
the back of the van.

&nbsp;

Like I say, the Questors
were fine but Tricia hadn�t bothered to bag Helen. She had evidently been
trying to free herself in the back of the van, I
reckoned that was what had dislodged the food trays. The combination of her
struggles and the spilled food meant she was in quite a mess. I untied her
ankles and pulled her from the van.

&nbsp;

Her tights were laddered from struggling on
the floor of the van and her black jacket and skirt were streaked with
mayonnaise and prawn sauce. She�d got something in her hair; it took me a while
to work out what it was, you don�t normally expect to see asparagus up there. Her
blouse was soaked from something; spilled wine I guessed � there was an open
bottle lying on the floor of the van where she had been. 

&nbsp;

As I stood her up, I brushed off the worst
of it. She�d even sat on some sandwiches; the back of her skirt was covered in
crushed food.� �You�re a messy eater, Ms
Stanhope,� I joked. She didn�t see the funny side and growled back through her
gag. From the way her mouth was working underneath the tape, I could see that
she felt she had plenty to say about her current circumstances.

&nbsp;

I pushed her on to the loading dock and
passed her over to one of Rick�s team. They took her away, still struggling.
Tricia and her colleague had got the Questors off the
van and out of their bags. Two more of the Prep Centre guards made to take them
away as well. �Have them stripped,� I called out, �But
carefully, the client wants the outfits as well.�

&nbsp;

I smiled at Tricia and her pal as the Questors were led away. �Thanks, ladies,� I said, �that was
great.� 

&nbsp;

Tricia�s colleague said, �Thanks, no
problem. I�ll check them in.� She gave Tricia a wave and followed the captives
into the building.

&nbsp;

Tricia watched her go. �She�s been a real
help. She�s been doing this for a couple of years now, I�m learning a lot.�

&nbsp;

�Great,� I said. �Well, today was certainly
professional. Harry would have been impressed.��


&nbsp;

Tricia smiled, �Yeah, maybe. I hope so. It
seems to take a lot to impress him.� She seemed a bit subdued; she should have
been really up after a good snatch like that. She looked as though she needed
cheering up. I felt I could use an evening of female company that wasn�t under
duress.

&nbsp;

�Well,� I said. �Anyway,� I pointed at her
uniform, �I wouldn�t want you to think I made a habit of making passes at
waitresses but I thought we might go for a drink when you get off.�

&nbsp;

Tricia hesitated for a moment but then grinned,
�Yeah, why not. I�d like that. I need to do the paperwork for this snatch and
book the outfit and the Ouzi back into stores but
I�ll be done in about an hour. How�s that for you?�

&nbsp;

�Fine,� I said. �It�s a date.� And it was �
the nearest thing to a normal date that I�d had since, well, since Rebecca had
gone off on her last trip for Atlantic. I watched as Tricia headed off towards the stores. It was a shame she
was checking the uniform back in, I thought, she looked cute in black and
white. I headed off to the Prep Centre reception cells.

&nbsp;

They�d put Helen in with her sister. That
was considerate, I thought. Andromeda had been giving the guards some trouble,
I imagined, and they�d strung her up naked, with her wrists high over her head,
balanced on tip toe in the middle of the cell. For consistency they�d put Helen
in the same position, though she was still wearing her food stained suit and
wine soaked blouse. They�d swapped her napkin gag for one of the Centre
standard ball gags but that didn�t seemed to have improved her humour any. They
both scowled at me as I came in. Andromeda gave me a rather more animated grunt
through the ring gag she�d been given.

&nbsp;

�Good evening,� I said. �Here you are
Helen, I promised I�d reunite you with your sister and you see I am a man of my
word.� Helen was having trouble standing upright, swaying on the chain that
held her wrists high above her head. �Those clothes are in a real mess,� I
said. �Here, let me help. If we undo this blouse it will get a chance to dry
off.� She squealed and twisted as I unfastened the buttons and pulled her
blouse form the waist band of her skirt. �There,� I said, �isn�t that better.�
She seemed to indicate that it wasn�t but as far as I was concerned the unobstructed
view that I now had of her tits was a distinct improvement. I unzipped her
skirt too and let that fall around her ankles. Her legs weren�t bad either. I
suppose I hadn�t really worked out what we were going to do with her and little
sis � the client hadn�t specified them at all. They were just collateral in the
collection of the Questors.

&nbsp;

Tricia put her head around the door to the
cell. �I thought I�d find you here,� she said. She�d changed out of her
waitress uniform and was now wearing a summery dress. It didn�t quite square
with my image of a gun toting abductor but she looked agreeably normal.
Suddenly I just wanted an evening off from all this. �Your client wants to see
you. He�s in with the Questors.�

&nbsp;

�OK, I suppose I ought to see him. You
won�t mind waiting a while will you? I�ll make it quick.�

&nbsp;

Don�t worry,� she said. �I can hang on.
I�ll see you in the office.�

&nbsp;

I gave her a smile and left her. I heard
the groans of Andromeda and Helen as Tricia followed me out and locked the door
to their cell. The Questors were two doors further
on. Mr Hananni and the girls were already there together
with one of the Centre guards. He was wasting no time in taking advantage of
his new purchase. Anya Tanith was bent forward, face
down across a desk, her hands still tied behind her. Hannani
was in the process of buckling his trouser belt, having evidently taken his
pleasure with Anya from behind. The other Questors
were looking on in horror. 

&nbsp;

�Mr Ross, you have excelled yourself!� Hananni exclaimed. �Everything that my friend the Kallinin said of you was true.�

&nbsp;

�Well, Mr Hananni,
thank you but it�s not all down to me.�

&nbsp;

�Well, it is your team and that is the main
thing. You have done just as you said.� He gestured to the four girls as the
guards herded them across the room until they were standing chained by their
neck collars to the wall of the cell, Looking at them naked I could now see
just how much modification they had had done to them; natural breasts just
aren�t that spherical for a start nor do they have nipples that you could use
to hang things from. The Prep Centre team had done a good job of getting them
displayed for Hananni, Rick was certainly getting in touch with the idea of
fitting in with the customer. I particularly liked the fact that he�d arranged
for some dress makers dummies to be positioned beside each of them, half of
them dressed in the costumes that the Questors had
been captured in, half in the costumes that Helen had brought. A nice touch.

&nbsp;

�I�m glad you are pleased, Mr Hananni,� I said. �In fact, I wondered if you�d like to
consider another couple of properties that we have available to us that could
add significantly to your business venture.� I took him to one side and
explained the availability of Helen and her sister. I was pleased with his
response; it looked like we wouldn�t need to put them to auction after all.

&nbsp;

Hananni wanted some time to think about the possibilities for Helen and
Andromeda, which was fine by me as they weren�t taking up too much space in the
cells and in any case I had other plans for the evening than chatting to
clients. I agreed to get one of the sales team to talk to him in a couple of
weeks and left him in search of Tricia.

&nbsp;

We had a great evening. It was good to
spend some time with a woman that didn�t involve chains, ropes and gags. Tricia
seemed happy too � at least that�s how I interpreted the enthusiastic sex we
both fell into at the end of the evening and the way in which we both went on
repeating it for the next two weeks.

Chapter 28 : Account Planning

&nbsp;

I was in the staff bar chatting with Rick.
�Just wanted to give you a bit of feed-back,� I said. �The Kalinin called last
night. He�s as pleased as punch with the girls you set up for his councillor�s
project. Said they were working out really well with their new owners. He�d
been a bit worried whether women of that age could be made sufficiently
obedient to appeal to a Kushtian � they wouldn�t want to have to bother with
too much training and punishment. But it seems your �orientation� has been
first rate. No problems at all. In fact a couple of them have proved a bit too
willing for their new masters. Two of the councillors have had to take holidays
to regain their strength.�

&nbsp;

Rick chuckled, �Kushtians obviously need
their cushions.� I didn�t bother with a laugh.

&nbsp;

We were still chatting when the news
started on the big TV screen that hung on the wall behind the bar. An
implausibly attractive newsreader was shuffling her papers and smiling out of
the screen. The sheen on her lip gloss sparkled as she turned towards the
viewer. �A surprise development this afternoon in the Central Asian Republic of Kushtia where recently the first ever
democratic elections were held. The new
governing council has announced that the Kalinin of Kushtia,
is to be sworn in as democratic life president of the new republic. The Kalinin was the
last hereditary ruler of Kushtia and had been in exile in the UK for
the last two years. Since the coup that brought about the introduction of
democracy there has been doubt about how the role of Head of State would be
filled. The First Minister of Kushtia explained the decision, which comes after
months of uncertainty about the role, by saying the Kalinin offered
continuity with many of the traditions of Kushtia that were so important to
retain while the country embraces the modern world of democracy and free market
economies.�

&nbsp;

Rick snorted. �Continuity!
That�s a new word for it. Still it�s good for us I guess.����� 

&nbsp;

�Sure,� I said, �it�s had the desired
outcome.� Brian drifted into the bar. �Hey, Brian, you�ll be pleased
about this. The Kalinin�s been elected president by the council. I reckon it�s all down to
the girls we got for the councillors.�

&nbsp;

�Your project, not mine,� said Brian,
irritated. �Won�t do me any good. I don�t suppose he�s
going to be jetting over here for auctions, is he?�

&nbsp;

�Well, no, I guess not but it�s got to be
good for all of us, hasn�t it? I mean that brought in the Questors
job and now he wants me to go out to Kushtia to talk about some more
opportunities. Come on, mate, you can�t just look at it from the point of view
of who�s at the auctions.�

&nbsp;

�I bloody well can. I�m not paid on
anything that doesn�t go through the Sales Centre. And don�t call me �mate�!�
He grabbed his beer and stalked out.

&nbsp;

Rick watched him go. �He�s pretty peeved
about this, you know. He had a pretty easy time of it until you turned up.
Least ways, that�s how he sees it. Anyway have you heard how the Kalinin is getting
on with his freebie? What was her name? Oh yeah, Alessa.
Can�t remember a piece we�ve had to keep gagged for so much of the time. What a
mouth!�

&nbsp;

�She seems to be getting on fine. Alessa has many faults and her mouth is probably the
biggest of them but the Kushtian�s have their own way
of solving that sort of problem. Apparently they�ve pierced her tongue and
every time she speaks out of turn they link her tongue stud with a chain to the
back of the mule that they have treading round in circles to pump water for
irrigating some of the fields on the Kalinin�s farm. She gets to follow the
mule around for a while and tread in the odd mule pat now and then. That seems
to be having some effect.�

&nbsp;

�Ouch,� said Rick. �I�ll say one thing for
your customers Larry they certainly have their own ways with women. I saw some
traffic about the girls we got for Hannani. He�s got
them working in his hi-tech maze already. He emailed me a link to their video
feed if you want to see it.�

&nbsp;

�That�s quick work,
I didn�t think you�d have finished with orientation yet.�

&nbsp;

�We weren�t doing it. He took them
un-prepped. I guess he wanted to do the orientation on site.�

&nbsp;

�What�s he got them doing?�

&nbsp;

�Nothing much yet. Just settling them in. They�ve got like a
bedroom with doors leading off into different parts of the maze. The idea is that
he turn up the heat cold or noise in the bedroom and drive them out into which
ever part of the maze he wants. There are lots of doors. If the controller is
quick he can separate girls by opening and closing them as they go though.
First time that happened they got really twitchy. Should make
good entertainment for Halinin�s pals.�� 

&nbsp;

�Interesting,� I said. �I need to keep an
eye on that stuff. Looks like we could pick up some hints.��� 

&nbsp;

�Yeah, you�re right.� Rick went on. �Still
we manage to do quite well too. We�ve finished with that writer of yours. She�s
ready any time you want.� Guaranteed not to whack you with a keyboard or anything else.�

&nbsp;

I grimaced. �Yeah, well, I�m trying to
forget about that. Can I see her? I was planning to talk to the woman that Glennis gave us. She might as well get started on that at
the same time?�

&nbsp;

�Sure,� Rick said, �come on through to her
cell.� I followed him through.

&nbsp;

I�d not really been exposed to the results
of Rick�s orientation programmes before so I was interested to see what he�d
been able to do. I did actually need her to be working properly.

&nbsp;

As Rick opened the door to her cell, Rachel
got to her feet. She was looking much better than when I�d seen her last. She�d
lost the sunken look from her eyes and she�d even put on a couple of pounds.
They�d put her back in the black short skirt and low cut top, low heeled shoes
and dark tights or stockings, I couldn�t really tell. She had on her collar and
identity tags of course. �Good morning, Rachel,� said Rick. �How are you
today?�

&nbsp;

�I am very well, Sir,� she said. �Thank
you.�

&nbsp;

�This is Larry,� Rick said. �You�ll be
serving him, now. Do you understand?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Sir,� Rachel responded looking at me
without any indication that she remembered us ever meeting before. �She turned
towards me. �What would you have me do, Sir?� she asked.

&nbsp;

�You�re a writer, I believe,� I said. Given
the way she was behaving, presumably as a result of her orientation, I thought
it was best to go back to first principles.

&nbsp;

�Yes, Sir. That is one of the duties I am trained for.�

&nbsp;

I looked at the way her breasts had been
hoisted up by the bra that they had put her in. No doubt they trained her in
the other duties that slaves were usually expected to perform as well. I wasn�t
sure if or when I�d have time to try them out. Things were working out pretty
well with Tricia and I guess I didn�t feel the need. �Good,� I said. �In which
case bring your pad and come with me.� I turned to Rick. �Thanks for this,� I
said. �She�ll be fine I think.�� 

&nbsp;

I took the leash that was fastened to her
collar and led her down to the cell where Sukie was
being held. I was aiming to use Sukie�s experiences
as a way to understand better the ways in which slaves were used in the US.

&nbsp;

Sukie was still cuffed, shackled, hooded and gagged when I found her but
then, like the guard said, no-one had said they should do anything else with
her. She still had the pen drive fob hanging from her neck. I unfastened it and
put it into my pocket to check out later.

&nbsp;

I looked at her curled up in a corner of
the cell and reached around behind her head to unbuckle her hood. Even though
lighting in the cell was subdued, she blinked in the unaccustomed light as the
hood came off. Her head was soaked in sweat, her dark hair plastered down
against her scalp. I prised the ball-gag from her mouth.

&nbsp;

�Thank you,� she said, her voice unusually
loud as a result of her ears still being plugged. I pulled the wads of wax from
each of them. She shook her head and thanked me again. �Where is Steve?� she
asked. �Am I being kennelled while he is away?� Then realising such familiarity
might not be appropriate in her new surroundings she dropped her eyes to the
floor. �I apologise,� she said, �I did not mean to speak disrespectfully.�

&nbsp;

�That�s all right, Sukie,�
I said conscious that she had obviously had no idea that Steve had been about
to abandon her. �You are no longer with Steve. We are your owners now.� She
looked confused and upset but said nothing. She bit her lip and hung her head,
understanding that she had no reason to have been told of her impending change
of ownership, but nevertheless disappointed, 

&nbsp;

�I need to talk to you Sukie.
I want you to tell us about your experiences, about how you were treated by
those that Steve gave you to. Rachel here is going to write down your story. Do
you understand?� 

&nbsp;

Sukie nodded. �Will I be with you?� she asked. �I enjoyed serving you on
the island.�

&nbsp;

�No Sukie, I have
to go away soon.�

&nbsp;

�Oh,� she said, disconsolately, another
straw of hope removed from her grasp.

�

�Do you remember how we talked when I came
to the island first of all?� Sukie nodded. �You told
me how Steve took you in?� Another nod. �Well, I want
you to tell your stories to her.� I gestured towards Rachel who was sitting
silently in a chair by the door. She had her notepad opened on her lap; pen in
hand she was waiting to begin. �Let�s start with those that Steve gave you to.�

&nbsp;

�But there were so many,� Sukie said. �On the island, if ever there was a visitor, I
was asked to be nice to them.� I looked across at Rachel, she was scribbling
away on her pad.

&nbsp;

�Like you were with me?�

&nbsp;

�Yes. Yes but not like that. Some of them
were brutal, cruel. Some of them were strange. But always I would do what I
could to please them. It was what Steve wanted.�

&nbsp;

�Go on I urged.� Rachel was listening
attentively.� 

&nbsp;

�The worst were the ones that came for the
pony races. Especially if their ponies had lost or if they�d
lost a lot betting. Then they�d beat me, or worse.�

&nbsp;

�Were there many of those? Pony races?�

&nbsp;

�Oh yes, perhaps one each month. There were
a dozen or more owners that would come. I was given to many of them. They all
have two or three ponies. Work them for a year or so and trade them on.�

&nbsp;

�And how would it work? With
Steve and you?�

&nbsp;

�The guests would arrive. I�d serve them
drinks. Sometimes they had their own slave girls with them - many of the owners
have three or four slaves as well as their ponies. Steve would have me dress in
riding clothes, jodhpurs, boots. They�d like that.
Sometimes one of them would just ask Steve if he could have me for the evening.
Sometimes Steve would offer me without being asked. Once they tied me up and
four of them played cards for me. Sometimes they just got drunk and weren�t
interested.�

&nbsp;

�Always men?� Rachel was still scribbling away.

&nbsp;

�Mainly. I did see some women at Steve�s. One a very
dumpy, unpleasant woman. I�m not sure about the others. They were the
worst.�

&nbsp;

�How so?�

&nbsp;

�A woman knows how to please another woman
but she knows how to hurt as well.�

&nbsp;

I looked across at Rachel. If she was
remembering anything of our earlier encounter she was managing to hide it.
She�d have plenty to do while I was away. It was sounding like Sukie would be an excellent source of intelligence.

&nbsp;

Chapter 29 : Lost in Translation

&nbsp;

I rolled over in bed. Tricia smiled. �I�m
sorry you�re going off to Kushtia. Why couldn�t they send that unpleasant shit,
Brian?�

&nbsp;

�Brian?� I said, �What�s with him? I know
he hasn�t been happy with what I�ve been up to but he could make it easier on
himself if he just saw which way the wind was blowing. His sales numbers have
been hopelessly optimistic for months according to Freddie. Even normally
discreet Elly has been getting impatient with him.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, this wasn�t business,� Tricia grinned,
rolling over to my side. �He made a pass at me this morning. Seemed pretty
upset when I turned him down, but I�m afraid that jolly sales manager persona
has never cut it with me.�

&nbsp;

�No,� I said, turning towards her. �You�ve
always had much better taste.� She threw a pillow at me.

&nbsp;

Two weeks after the Questor�s
collection and my first date with Tricia, I�d had to endure quite a few jokes
from the guys in the Prep Centre and the Sales Centre about bothering with a
girlfriend when I could make use of any of the stock at any time I chose. I didn�t
think I really needed to explain that it wasn�t the same thing. Besides, if
things worked out the stock levels would be coming down and then where would I
be?

&nbsp;

Now though, and much to my regret, I had to
leave Tricia behind and take myself of to Kushtia.

&nbsp;

It was a gruesome flight. Air Kushtia had a
lot to learn about in-flight service and comfort even from Ryanair.
They certainly didn�t have the idea about cabin crew. Homely would be the
generous description of the two stewardesses. I don�t know if the Kushtian�s had a shot-put team in the 1976 Olympics but if
they did this was what happened to them. Their uniforms looked like they had
been designed by a committee of misogynists and manufactured by a team that
were more familiar with a staple gun than a sewing machine. I wondered if we
could re-acquire Rebecca and interest the CEO in her experiences. 

&nbsp;

Then the Ilyushin
hit another air pocket and I found myself thinking that the main priority for
once wasn�t the cabin service. I tried reading the report that Rachel had
prepared on her initial interviews with Sukie. The
turbulence made it impossible. The in-flight movie turned out to be a
celebration of the new Kushtian hydroelectric dam and irrigation programme. The
food gave me little encouragement as to how well I�d be eating for the next few
days, but then I guessed that there aren�t many airlines where the food on
board is a great advert for the national cuisine. I settled down to try to
doze. 

&nbsp;

We touched down (I use the expression
loosely) at Kolin, the Kushtian capital�s airport. I
was grateful to get off the plane, though given the decrepit nature of the
airport buildings, I felt I might have been safer in
the air. A charmless Kushtian immigration officer
scowled at my passport and waved me through. A sign in the baggage reclaim said
in encouraging letters, �Air Kushtia : Kushtia�s Favourite Airline�. An indignant traveller had
crossed out the word �favourite� and written in �only�. Nobody had bothered to
correct it.

&nbsp;

Against all expectations my suitcase fell
through the hole in the wall of the baggage reclaim area onto the pile of
waiting bags. There wasn�t anything resembling a trolley. I was glad that I�d
decided to travel light.� 

�

I found my way to the Kolin
International Hotel, a fly blown piece of 1960�s soviet concrete, still pock
marked from the machine gun fire of the fighting that expelled the regime that
had deposed the Kalinin or possibly from the coup before the coup before that. Halfway
between the airport and the Kushtian capital, it sat sulkily behind a wire
fence alongside the main highway. As evidence of the economic revival in
Kushtia there were more trucks on the highway than there were mule carts but
not by much. It looked like the only excitement I�d be seeing would be whatever
was on television in the hotel. 

&nbsp;

The aim of the trip was to visit the
Kushtian Minister of Trade. Freddie had said that it was another contact the Kalinin had passed
on. �Might be a chance to get some orders, old man!�
He�d said. �Build up the old exports like you suggested. I�d got an appointment
to see him on the following day. I was also aiming to look in on the Kalinin�s son just
to provide a little after sales contact. It was the least we could do, I
thought.

&nbsp;

I was standing in the hotel bar, trying to
decide just which sorts of vegetables had been boiled, pressed, strained and
left to stand in a warm place order to provide the traditional Kushtian
non-alcoholic cordial. I was coming to the conclusion that you wouldn�t be able
to work it out from the taste and that maybe you wouldn�t want to know when an
attractive young woman strode into he bar and swept confidently up to me.
Things were improving I felt.

&nbsp;

�Cora Argyll,� she said extending her hand.
�You�ll be from FCE? I�m the Trade Attach� from the British Embassy.� She gave
a welcoming smile and then, seeing my sceptical look. �Well, the second
assistant trade attach� actually.�

&nbsp;

I smiled in response. �Lawrence Ross,� I
said. She was certainly a welcome addition to the scenery. Tall, willowy and
with long, wavy, dark hair she was in her late twenties. Probably her first
overseas posting, I guessed. She had a friendly smile and what looked as though
it might be an attractive figure hidden underneath a mannish jacket and a skirt
that, in deference to Kushtian views on women in public places, reached the
floor. She wore a pale blue, fur trimmed, pill box hat in the tradition of many
Kushtian women�s dress and a long scarf in a matching colour draped around her
shoulders.� 

&nbsp;

�I was asked to attend your meeting with
the Minister,� she said. �The Ambassador is most keen that the Embassy is seen
to be helping British companies to build links with Kushtia.�

&nbsp;

I wasn�t keen for official involvement.
�I�m not sure that will be necessary,� I said. �I mean I appreciate it and all
that but I�m sure I can manage.�

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry but I really must insist. You�ll
need a translator at the very least and the Ambassador is most anxious that the
trade delegation does everything possible to assist in discussions with the new
regime. I�m sure you won�t want to cause any difficulty with the Ambassador?�

&nbsp;

I decided that she was possibly right. At
the very least she could help to get things moving. We arranged to meet the
following morning. I spent my evening watching Kushtian television. It wasn�t
as good as the in-flight movie had been.

&nbsp;

She met me at the hotel an hour before my
meeting with the trade minister. �We�ll take my car,� she said as she strode up
to greet me in the hotel lobby.

&nbsp;

�That shouldn�t be necessary,� I responded.
�I believe a car is being sent.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, I�d be surprised,� she said. �It would
be most unusual for a Council Minister to show such �� 

&nbsp;

We were interrupted by the arrival of a
bell hop. �Your car is here, Sir,� he said. I smiled and thanked him.

&nbsp;

�I am impressed,� said Cora and we headed
for the door. As we got there Cora paused and swept her scarf up across her
face.

&nbsp;

�Is that necessary?� I said.

&nbsp;

�Oh, yes. The Kushtian Council is trying to
be as open as possible to western ideas but people still expect an unmarried
woman to be veiled, especially in the presence of a married man such as the
Minister. It�s not really a religious thing as I understand it � it�s more that
the Kushtian men sort of - well � owned their wives and a
women could not show her face until she had an owner. Can you believe
the trade minister has four wives? In this day and age?�

&nbsp;

�Extraordinary.�

&nbsp;

�His latest wife is said to be a gift from
the Kallinin! I think what really happened was that
there was some sort of ritual gift bestowing � probably based on some historic
practice. It�s funny how these things live on. Still we must respect their
culture. After all, look at us with the Changing of the Guard and the Yeoman
Warder�s Ceremony of the Keys. I expect that all seems silly to them.�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� I said as we stepped outside the
hotel to see the bright yellow HumVee with its
government flags and a smartly uniformed driver standing beside it. �I hadn�t
realised we needed armour plated transport,� I said.

&nbsp;

�I think it�s mainly because of the roads,�
Cora said. �They are pretty atrocious.�

&nbsp;

The driver opened the door for us and we
got in. She was right about the roads. As soon as we left the beautifully
surface hotel drive, the road degenerated into a series of potholes across
which we bounced remorselessly. Another length of smooth tarmac heralded the
imminent arrival at the Trade Ministry. �My word,� said Cora as the HumVee drew up. �you are honoured.
That�s the Minister on the steps, come to greet you.� She adjusted her veil and
the two of us got out.

&nbsp;

As we reached the top of the steps the
Minister greeted us in the guttural tones of the Kushtian language.

&nbsp;

�The Minister welcomes you to Kushtia and
hopes that you and he can have a mutually beneficial discussion,� Cora
translated.

&nbsp;

�Please thank the Minister for his greeting
and say that I too hope our discussions will be mutually beneficial,� I said,
keeping up the formality.

&nbsp;

He showed us through the building and into
his office. Sitting at a desk as we entered, a veiled lady, her wrists in manacles,
sat pummelling an ancient typewriter. �Don�t worry about the secretary,� Cora
said quietly, �I know it looks like she is in chains but it�s just a sort of
costume jewellery. The Kushtians used to keep their women under very strict
controls and even though now the new regime is introducing more liberal ways
many of the women like to dress traditionally.�

&nbsp;

�Ah,� I said unconvinced by her
explanation.� 

&nbsp;

Even with her veil on, I could tell that
Cora was embarrassed by the Minister�s next remark. She turned towards me. �He
says would you like to, err, wash your hands?� 

&nbsp;

�Oh, good idea, before we get started on
talks,� I responded.

&nbsp;

�Its just that obviously, well, I can�t
come with you can I?�

&nbsp;

�I think I can manage that without creating
a diplomatic incident,� I said

&nbsp;

�Of course, yes, well. He says it�s through
there,� she pointed to a door, �if you�d like to follow him.�

&nbsp;

The minister was a tall man. I felt dwarfed
as I stood beside him in the stalls of the washroom and we studiously avoided
looking at one another in the manner common to men in washrooms everywhere.
Suddenly he spoke; not in Kushtian but in perfect English.

&nbsp;

�She�s very attractive but a bit of a pain
in the arse, isn�t she?� he said.

&nbsp;

�Ah, I�m not sure it would be diplomatic to
say,� I responded with a smile. �I didn�t think you spoke English.�

&nbsp;

�No,� said the minister, �no, neither does she. Still, we�ll humour her. Let�s take this as far as we
can with her here and then we�ll talk again later.� He turned to the basins, we washed our hands and returned to his office.

&nbsp;

The minister and I were sat in armchairs
facing one another. Cora sat between us. The minister began speaking in
Kushtian again. Cora translated.

&nbsp;

�The Minister says that he understands that
Clegg Enterprises are seeking to supply the Kushtian Government procurement
programme. And oh, sorry,�

&nbsp;

I looked down to see the minister
ostentatiously zipping his fly to the consternation of Cora. He didn�t stop
talking.

&nbsp;

Cora coughed, embarrassed, and went on.
�Perhaps you could outline your proposals.�

&nbsp;

�I represent a number of concerns together
known as Clegg Enterprises,� I said. I allowed Cora time to translate. �The
most relevant of these to the Kushtian procurement programme is, I believe,
Clegg Meat Products. We specialise in a range of prepared and treated meats.
Our customers tell us that they are very much to the taste of a discerning
palate. If Kushtia is intending to develop its tourism infrastructure then I
you will need to have access to the best of international cuisine alongside
traditional Kushtian dishes and of course as the Council extends its
international ties they will wish to ensure that only the finest dishes are
available to their guests.�� As Cora
translated, the Minister laughed and muttered something.

&nbsp;

Cora said, �He
says you shouldn�t expect too much of Kushtian cuisine, it�s an oxymoron, like
military intelligence or - oh! � women�s liberation.�
There was a pause. �Ah, I see.� Cora said something in Kushtian back to the
minister. He smiled. �He was explaining the joke,� she said, not apparently
amused herself.

&nbsp;

�Perhaps I can explain further Minister,� I
went on. �As I said we can offer a wide range of meat products, most based on
British livestock of course. Our most important value to yourselves
though is that we can make particular products available to meet particular
needs. So for example, if the minister was to be hosting a dinner for a number
of dignitaries we could make available particularly dark meats or light meats
or for those that like their meat rare, very red. I believe the Kalinin�s son is
particularly fond of red meat, for example. Of course we are able to offer a
range of meats from rare breeds and from some of the finest herds in British
bloodstock.�

&nbsp;

Cora translated diligently. The minister responded.
Cora was apparently embarrassed again, I could swear
that I could see her blush behind her veil. �The minister says that he
understands your proposition. In Kushtia they can appreciate excellent food for
after all was it not the first Kalinin that said, �The sweetest milk comes from the cow with the largest
udders.� He also wonders if you have brought any samples with you.�

&nbsp;

�Regrettably no, Minister,� I replied, �It
is difficult without import clearance and until we have an agreement I thought
it wise not to do so. I believe, however, that the Minister and several other
members of the Council have already had the chance to sample our products.� 

&nbsp;

Cora translated, the Minister responded and
she spoke again. �The minister says that the products he has sampled have
proved most excellent though he is a man of a hearty appetite and always
welcomes more.� Cora put in an aside,� I think he is angling for some sort of
inducement. It�s quite common business practice here, I�m afraid.�

&nbsp;

I said to Cora, �I know. I�ll be quite
happy to accommodate him if it helps things along. You won�t want to know about
this, though. Right?� 

&nbsp;

�Well, I think it would be best. Ah� The
minister started speaking again. �The minister says he has a taste for some
rather leaner meat. He is reminded of a meal that he had at the Embassy
recently. When he had a most enjoyable time, he says, - ah - because he had the
opportunity to sit next to your delightful interpreter. Perhaps you could
arrange for the same meat to be made available.� Cora looked a little confused.
She turned to me. �I�m sorry,� she said it�s a little difficult to translate,
The Kushtian language sometimes gets parts of speech muddled up and its not
always easy to work out exactly what is being referred to. 

&nbsp;

�That�s all right,� I responded. �You are
doing an excellent job. Tell the minister I will see what I can do. I think
that�s all we can hope for today.�

&nbsp;

Cora and the Minister exchanged words in
Kushtian and he got to his feet holding out his hand. I shook hands with him
and we left. The HumVee was waiting for us outside. 

&nbsp;

We got in and it headed back to towards the
hotel, bouncing over the poorly paved road. Cora unfastened her veil with
relief. �Thank you,� I said. �You were most helpful.�

&nbsp;

�That�s all right. It�s what the Embassy is
for. We can�t be seen to be involved with inducements, though. That would be
quite improper. I could, quite informally, find out what was on the menu for
that dinner if that would help.�

&nbsp;

�Well, yes. I want make sure I that the
Minister gets exactly what he was hoping for.� I smiled at Cora, convinced that
while translating accurately she had completely failed to grasp the meaning of
my discussions with the Minister.

&nbsp;

�Yes,� she said looking puzzled for a
moment. �Although, now I come to think about that dinner I�m almost certain we
had fish.�� She grinned sheepishly. �I�m
sorry,� she said, �I Think I may have got this in a bit of a muddle. Still
while we�re talking about dinner, how about if I take you out for something
tomorrow night? The Ambassador is always keen for us to be building contacts
with new companies out here.�

&nbsp;

�Good heavens, Ms Argyll,� I said with a
smile. �It sounds like you�re propositioning me. But that seems like a great
idea. I�d like it.�

&nbsp;

�OK,� she said, �I�ll catch you about 7, if
that�s OK.� 

&nbsp;

�Fine,� I said, though somehow I thought
she wasn�t going to make it to our meeting.

&nbsp;

Chapter 30 : On The Road Again

&nbsp;

I spent most of the following morning at
the hotel, talking on the phone to Freddie. He wasn�t keen on a pick up without
doing a proper background check first but he did want to help out the Minister.
In the end we agreed to go ahead. I took a short call from the Minister. He�d
just wanted to check that I�d understood his point of view from our previous meeting.
I had. Did I think I could provide a solution. I did.
Would it help if he got me some assistance from the Interior Ministry? I would.
They were very helpful. I was more than confident.

&nbsp;

I had one other phone call. It was from
Rick. He thought I�d want to know that Rachel had gone over the wire. He
sounded pretty embarrassed about it. So was Sebastian. It was him that she�d
jumped to get out.

&nbsp;

The way Rick told it; Rachel had a problem
with her computer. Sebastian had been working to sort it out. Rachel had come
across very grateful and he�d decided to take advantage of the fact that they�d
given her the full set of slave skills when they conditioned her. The only
problem is that it looked like some of the conditioning didn�t take for some
reason. Seb had Rachel strip off and was getting
naked himself. He had one leg out of his pants, and was balancing to try and
get the other one out when she crashed him against the wall. The cell walls are
tough. She was luckier with Seb than she was with me.
It was late at night, some of the security guys on CCTV watch were dozing and
it was about an hour later when they found him. She had used her stockings to
hog tie him and then she�d gagged him with her panties and her bra. He was
grunting like mad by the time someone had worked out he was missing and gone
looking for him. It looked like Rachel had used Seb�s
key tag to get out and had got clear of the Prep Centre. Harry was spitting
mad, he�d had to pull a team off collections to go looking for her.

&nbsp;

There wasn�t much I could do about it from
where I was and I guessed that everyone involved would be having a discussion
about their shortcomings with Freddie. I asked Rick to give me an update when
he knew more.

&nbsp;

That afternoon, as I later heard, Cora
Argyll was heading back to her apartment in her Mini Cooper on the stretch of
gravel and potholes that passed for the Kolin ring
road. With irritation she saw a police car behind her. The flashing blue lights
meant the same in Kushtia as they did anywhere. She pulled over and stopped.

&nbsp;

She�d looked back at the police officer
coming towards her car. It was a woman. �Well, that�s good to see,� thought
Cora. Then looking at the overly tight black shirt and the mirrored, aviator
sunglasses, �but why do they always think they have to look like something out
of Police Academy?�

&nbsp;

The police officer came up to her window.
�Could you get out of the car, please madam,� she said with the growling accent
of a Kushtian from the far north of the country. 

&nbsp;

�What is the trouble officer?� Cora asked.

&nbsp;

�If you could just get
out of the car, please.� Cora did as she was
asked and handed over her driving license and Embassy papers. �You were driving
rather erratically, madam,� the officer said, �all over the road.�

&nbsp;

�I was avoiding the pot holes officer,�
Cora responded. �You can see what the road is like.�

&nbsp;

�Well maybe madam. But I would like to test
whether you have been drinking.� Her hand went to a pouch on her belt and she
took out a breathalyser. 

&nbsp;

�It�s nonsense officer. I know the law in Kushtia, I know you have a zero-alcohol limit for driving.
I�m a British diplomat.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, madam, I saw the CD plates on your
car. I�m afraid that we find some diplomats do not have great respect for our
local laws and customs. Irrespective of your diplomatic immunity we cannot have
drivers under the influence of alcohol. Please blow into the breathalyser.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, this is absurd. But very well,� she�d
said grabbing the box. 

&nbsp;

�Just blow steadily into the tube.� She did
so. The officer took the breathalyser from her and peered at it. �Oh, dear,�
she said. �I�m afraid this is not good. You see this number here � this is far
too high. We�ll have to get this checked. I�m sure there is no problem really
but if you could come back to my car we can go to the Police Station.�

&nbsp;

�But, but, its nonsense,� said Cora,
protesting, as the police officer took her by the arm.

&nbsp;

�Yes, madam, but I�m afraid you must come
along with me,� she said taking her towards the police car. 

&nbsp;

�Well, all right but you must contact the
Ambassador.�

&nbsp;

�Of course. We can do that at the station. I�m sure we�ll clear things up
quickly there anyway.� The officer reached to another pouch on her belt. �I
need to handcuff you, please, Madam.�

&nbsp;

�That�s not necessary officer.�

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry madam, but it is the procedure.
You see my partner will have to drive your car back and I can�t have a suspect
in the car with me on my own unless they are handcuffed. Our procedures are
quite clear. I�m sure you understand.�

&nbsp;

Reluctantly Cora held out her wrists. The officer
snapped one cuff on but pulled her wrists behind her back before fastening the
second. Cora yelped as the cuff locked shut. �Sorry Madam, I�m sure we will
sort this out. Now get in the car please.� The officer helped Cora into the
back of the car holding the top of her head to make sure she cleared the roof
as she got in. Getting into the front she drove off with Cora fuming quietly
but helplessly on the back seat.

&nbsp;

Ten kilometres down the road the car pulled
off at a petrol station. The car parked at the back. �I need the rest room,�
said Cora�s driver. �You�ll be OK there.� 

&nbsp;

And that was where I found Cora when I
drove up alongside in the battered pickup truck I had hired. She seemed pretty
pleased to see me until she saw what I aimed to do with the roll of tape I was
carrying. Once I got it over her mouth I couldn�t tell whether she was swearing
at me in English or Kushtian. I was certain though that it was one or the
other. I got her out of the police car and into the front seat of my truck and strapped
her in. With her veil arranged across her face no one could see she was gagged.
Then there just remained the question of the commission payment. I tossed the
package as agreed onto the front seat of the police car; two genuine Wonderbra�s each for the girls, one in black, one in white,
�36B� for the arresting officer, �34C� for her partner. It seemed like a good
deal to me but apparently they were a rarity out there. I dropped Cora off as
agreed at a corrugated iron shed that backed onto a wire fenced compound on the
edge of the airport. I added some ropes to Cora�s ankles to stop her wandering
off. The sign on the compound said Kushtian Ministry of Trade
: Bonded Stores.� She was still
pretty peeved as I padlocked the door��� 

&nbsp;

My meeting later that day with the Trade
Minister went exceptionally well. There was one interruption. Apparently the
Interior Minister had been asked by the British Ambassador to try to track down
a diplomat that appeared to have gone missing. There was some question that she
may have been kidnapped by insurgents from over the border. The Ambassador was
most upset. The Ambassador was concerned that nothing should interfere with my
negotiations. The Interior Minister promised an investigation. I was happy to
reassure the Ambassador that I saw no reason for this to interfere with my
business discussions. I hoped that no harm had come to the diplomat concerned.
Apparently her car had been found near the border. Burned out, it appeared. The
Ambassador agreed it was not a safe place for his staff to be travelling to
and, of course, he would advise his staff not to do so in future. 

&nbsp;

The Trade Minister,
apologised but was unable to spend much time with me. He was anxious to get on
with his business of state because he had a relaxing evening planned at home
that day. He was however, very happy that Clegg Enterprises should handle Kushtia�s future requirements for shipments from the UK. His
secretary would draw up the appropriate license, he said. If I liked he could
have her deliver it to my hotel that evening.

&nbsp;

That seemed an excellent idea to me. We
shook hands and I left him.

&nbsp;

To while away what was left of the
afternoon I had a visit planned. I�d promised to see the Kalinin�s son as
part of the trip and took the opportunity to call in on him.

&nbsp;

�Mr Larry,� he beamed as I walked in
through the ornate archway that led into his palace from the courtyard.
�Welcome, indeed. Welcome. Will you take tea with us?�

&nbsp;

I was happy to accept his hospitality. He
showed the way to an opulent room, its walls covered with elaborate patterned
mosaics. He reclined on a bench along one wall and invited me to do the same.
He clapped his hands. Ginger, the two Mel�s and Emma appeared in full harem dress, wrists and ankles shackled, and knelt before us.

&nbsp;

�They look well,� I said. �Married life
must suit them.�

&nbsp;

�It certainly suits me,� the Kalinin�s son
responded. �They are a source of constant delight to me. Tea!� he ordered and
the girls scuttled away, giggling.

&nbsp;

�I did not see Victoria,� I
remarked, and then, recalling my visit to Wales,
said, �Surely she is not still locked in your casket?�

&nbsp;

�Ah, no, Mr Lawrence. I must admit that she, of all of my wives, found it the most
difficult to adapt, but now all is well between us. She has some very
remarkable skills which I have found most valuable now we are back in our home
country.�

&nbsp;

�How so?� 

&nbsp;

�Well, Mr Lawrence, you must understand
about Kushtia that our society is very much oriented towards the desires of the
men and the need for women to meet those needs.� There was more giggling as the
four girls came back in clutching trays with tea, cups and sweet meats. They
knelt between us, pouring tea and passing food to us. �So in our society if a
man should submit to a woman it would be a cause of great scandal.�

&nbsp;

�I can see that,� I responded. Emma was
sliding towards me on her belly, somehow managing to hold a plate aloft. She
sat up and offered the plate to me. I took one of the cakes from it and nodded
my thanks.

&nbsp;

�Well, wife Victoria has a talent that is
very rare here. She can bend a man to her will. Not, of course, a strong man like myself,�

&nbsp;

�Of course�

&nbsp;

�But a weaker man, then
yes. And of course if I should come to know of
such things it gives me a great power over the man too. And such power can be
useful in a country like this.�

&nbsp;

�So you encourage Victoria to
exploit these men?�

&nbsp;

�Not encourage - require! She is subject to
me as my wife and she does as I will. And like a good wife she is a great help
to her husband.�

&nbsp;

�And that is why she is not here now?�

&nbsp;

�Indeed. Let us see if we can find her.� He
clapped his hands and his other four wives made to collect up the tea things
and clear them away. �Come through here.� He led the way through a beaded
curtain that hung over another arched doorway, along a tiled and mirrored
corridor and on to a balcony overlooking a lower room. There, Victoria was
reclining on a couch in a room as luxuriously furnished as the ones we had just
left. She was running the leather thongs of a flogger through her fingers.
Crouching at her feet, providing an attentive foot massage, was a naked,
hooded, Kushtian male with a collar around his neck and a golden chain that ran
from a strap around his penis to Victoria�s hand. The Kalinin�s son
clapped his hand and Victoria looked up towards us. She waved and leapt to her feet, knocking her
slave over as she did so. She tied his leash to a ring beside her couch and ran
to greet us.

&nbsp;

As she reached the top of the stairs and
approached us it became apparent that her costume was even richer than that of
the others. She was dressed in a black costume decorated with gold chains and
coins. Her veil � unlike the others she wore a veil � was black as well,
covering all of her face except her eyes. It draped from a gold chain across
her face down in two long cascades of silk that linked back to rings set in her
pierced nipples. As she reached us she fell to her knees. �Husband!� she
greeted the Kalinin�s son enthusiastically. �And Mr Lawrence!�

&nbsp;

�Greetings wife,� the Kalinin�s son said.
�How are your duties today?�

&nbsp;

�You can see, husband,� she gestured to the
man who was kneeling, head bowed, totally motionless, as he had been left. �He
is completely at my command. And so he is completely at your command too.�

&nbsp;

�Very good. It would suit my purpose it he were to leave at the end of this
afternoon aching to be with you again and distracted from his purpose this
evening. I expect to meet him later.�

&nbsp;

�Very good, husband, I shall do as you
wish.� She put her hands together and bowed before each of us before returning
to her couch. We watched from the gallery as the man looked up at her return.
She gestured with a finger to her left foot and he bent to it with his tongue.
She lay back, reaching out for a piece of fruit from the golden plate that
stood beside the couch. She looked up at us as she did so and gave an
exaggerated wink.

&nbsp;

�You see what an asset she is to me. Truly,
Mr Lawrence, you are helping to re-establish our dynasty. Even my father sees
what an asset my wives are. He will be persuaded to let me have more soon, I
know.�

&nbsp;

�I hope we can help you in that quest,� I
said.

&nbsp;

�I am sure, Mr Larry, I am sure. You have
shown your skills in that area, why should I turn to
others. Besides, I still remember some of those others that you suggested when
we first met.� He gave me an exaggerated wink. I smiled in response, happily
pondering the opportunity for further business.��� 

&nbsp;

�Things have turned out well for your
father. Good fortune has seen him to his new position.�

&nbsp;

�Come now, Mr Larry, do not be na�ve. Good
fortune had little to do with it. Fortune is like a precious metal, first you
have to smelt it from the ore and that takes effort. Fortune only comes to
those that seek it.�

&nbsp;

�I believe the Kalinin�s gift to
the Councillors may have helped to smelt the ore of his fortune in this case,�
I said, happy to adopt the Kushtian allegory.�


&nbsp;

�Surely you do not think our councillors
corruptible?� the son giggled conspiratorially.

&nbsp;

�Not in the least,� I said with mock
indignation.� �I merely suggest that the
Council recognised the value of old traditions respected.�� 

&nbsp;

�Well these old traditions are working in
other ways than even my father hoped. One of our poor councillors has become
most unwell. I believe it to be the exertion. He is a very proud man; a very
vigorous man. He was very potent in his youth, but now, in later years, it is
not so easy for him and I fear his new wife has such enthusiasm.�

&nbsp;

�Which of them is it?

&nbsp;

�The one whose hair is
like the sun setting through the dust of the autumn storms. Her appetites match and exceed the councillor�s own. It is feared
he may die.�

&nbsp;

�Oh dear,� I said. �Will that cause your
father difficulties?�

&nbsp;

�Not at all. Quite the reverse. You see the councillor,
knowing my fondness for women with auburn hair has bequeathed me her in his
will, and that will mean I shall also take his position on the council.�

&nbsp;

�I thought the council was democratically
elected.�

&nbsp;

�Of course, Mr Larry, of
course. But you have to remember how democracy
works. People vote for those that they feel ought to rule. Here if a man wills
his wife to another, others will think that he is showing who should succeed
him. As we say �who follows me in the bed chamber, follows me in life�. There
will be an election. But I will be surprised if I do not win.� The Kalinin�s son
smiled. 

&nbsp;

�But still, as I say, I need to leave
shortly. I have some things to prepare. You are most welcome to stay here of
course. You must enjoy my hospitality. I suspect this is a little more
comfortable than your hotel. 

&nbsp;

�I am expecting to receive something there
this evening from The Trade Minister�s secretary,
otherwise I would be happy to accept.�

&nbsp;

�That is no problem. I will have word sent
to his office. She will be instructed to deliver it here.�

&nbsp;

�As you wish. I gratefully accept.�

&nbsp;

�Excellent, I will send Emma to take care
of you. She seemed particularly pleased to see you.�

&nbsp;

�You are most generous,� I replied. It
would at least be more entertaining than an evening in the hotel. The Kalinin�s son�s
palace looked like it had a better stocked bar and Emma was likely to prove
more entertaining than anything on TV Kushtia Channel One, Two or Three. Plus I
needed something to take my mind off what was happening back in the UK with
Rachel.

Chapter 31 : Emma�s Contribution

&nbsp;

The hospitality of the Kalinin�s son was proving very agreeable. Emma
joined me in one of the large bedrooms. She was sprawled on the canopied bed
when I emerged from the shower. 

&nbsp;

She was wearing a stylised, emerald green,
version of the Kushtian national costume, a beaded and jewelled bodice that
left her midriff bare with a long panelled skirt split to the hip so as to
reveal her legs as she rolled across the bed. She grinned as my towel slipped
from my hips. �Excellent,� she said, �I win!�

&nbsp;

�What?� I said.

&nbsp;

She pointed at my naked crotch. �Victoria said that you�d
be really well hung.�

&nbsp;

�Oh thanks,� I said. �Hang on; aren�t you supposed
to be the slave?�

&nbsp;

�Pooh!� she said sitting up on her heels
and leaning forward to display a cleavage that was doing it�s best to help my
insulted member to redeem its reputation. �Wives aren�t slaves in Kushtia, they
are valued possessions. Anyway, you owe us an explanation.�

&nbsp;

�Explanation?� 

&nbsp;

�We were a happy bunch of girls, enjoying
making music and enjoying our own names. We meet Mr Impresario who seduces us
with promises of bright lights and glamour. And instead we�re stolen away,
bought by a man that insists on calling us by our stage names and flown half
way across the world to heaven knows where. I think that needs explanation.�

&nbsp;

�I don�t remember the bit about bright
lights and glamour,� I said. �I think the best I offered was some better gigs.
Isn�t this a better gig?� I sat down on the bed beside her.

&nbsp;

She smiled, �Well it�s better than that pub
in Southwark that�s for sure and our husband�s cute enough. Except we have to
perform as the band � he�s got this karaoke machine and we all have to turn out
in the gear. Getting here was completely shite as
well.�

&nbsp;

�Bad flight?� She seemed quite happy for me to run my hand up her leg in the
general direction of her thigh.

&nbsp;

�Not the flight, the bit before,� she said.
�The being bundled up into boxes, the being fucked whenever anyone felt like it
without so much as a please or thank you, the beatings and the chains. That was
the shite bit.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah well, when the Kalinin decides on something for his son, he
likes people to go for it.� My fingers were tracing a pattern across her belly.
Her body was responding to my touch even if she wasn�t saying anything to
acknowledge the fact.

&nbsp;

�Still, all we were ever in it for was the
money and the glamour and this,� she waved at the opulence of the room�s d�cor,
�looks like money and glamour to me.�

&nbsp;

My hand was on the fastening of her bodice.
�How do the others feel about it?�

&nbsp;

�Mel C probably took it hardest, but even
she�s coming round. She found the rape and the humiliation hard. But we all
looked after her. Mel B�s been like a bitch on heat with hubby; she�s pregnant,
would you believe, though hubby doesn�t know yet. Ginger � well she�s just good
for a laugh anywhere and here�s no different. And Vicky, she�s has found her
own little niche.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, I saw,� I said. �What will happen to
the baby? Mel�s?�

&nbsp;

�Can you imagine? If it�s
a boy? The first son of the first son of the Kalinin? It will be
a major state celebration. Kushtia may be a democracy but that doesn�t mean
they don�t still have a yearning for the old days of a hereditary dynasty. If
it�s a girl, well, she�ll have a wonderful life here in the palace and marry
well. Either way the child will have five doting mothers, more when our husband
marries again, and probably quite a few brothers and
sisters.�� 

&nbsp;

The hooks on her bodice fastening finally
came loose. I pushed the garment aside exposing her breasts. I cupped one in my
hand. Finally she acknowledged my touch.

&nbsp;

�That�s nice,� she said, �I like that.
And,� she reached out with her hand for my now well stiffened cock, �you seem
to be liking it too.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, the only question is how far your
husband�s hospitality extends,� I said sliding closer to her. 

&nbsp;

�Kushtian traditions of hospitality are
strong. The first Kalinin
said �for my guest; my property is his�. Those traditions are upheld to this
day.�

&nbsp;

�And you are your husband�s property?�

&nbsp;

�Oh yes. Even allowing for the conventions
here, the wedding ceremony is quite explicit. The husband vows �I take this
wife in ownership to keep and care for as my finest horse or hawk�, and the
wife answers �I pledge myself to be kept and cared for.� Besides, I�m assuming
that a sum of money changed hands for arranging the match between us and our
husband. In Kushtia it is usual for the husband to pay the father of the wife but
I suppose all traditions have to be updated. Still,� her finger nails raked up
the underside of my cock, �don�t worry about going further than my husband
would wish.� She shrugged off her unfastened bodice and leant towards me waving
her head backwards and forwards so that her long blonde hair brushed sensuously
across my crotch. She moved her mouth towards my cock. �Well, I may have won my
bet with Vicky but it seems to come up to expectations with a little
encouragement. I guess I win both ways.�

&nbsp;

I leant back and let her bring her lips
down around my shaft. I didn�t know whether she had learned her techniques
before she got to Kushtia or after but she was certainly more than competent.
�Well,� I said, arching my back to push forward to meet her, �you�re well able
to keep your head up in the fellatio stakes. Or should that be down?�

&nbsp;

She coughed with laughter and pulled away.

&nbsp;

�Don�t stop,� I said.

&nbsp;

�Then don�t make me laugh, or you�ll end up
being bitten,� she answered, licking her lips and bending her head to her task
once more.� 

&nbsp;

I was still enjoying Emma�s skills as a
fellatrix when the Minister�s secretary arrived. She appeared in the room
wearing a long sleeved white blouse and a floor length black skirt, her face
veiled, of course under a long white scarf. She seemed to see nothing odd in
Emma and myself stretched out on the bed.

&nbsp;

Without saying anything, she passed me two
envelopes, one large and thick, the other small and addressed to me. I opened
it. Emma carried on trying to distract me.

&nbsp;

I read the contents: �My Friend,� it said,
�Thanks to your ingenuity I shall be enjoying a pleasant evening. I hope you
will accept my thanks and the use of my secretary, Ekrana,
for the evening. She may lack the sophistication of some western girls but I think
you will find her amusing, nevertheless. She has also prepared a license for
Clegg Enterprises but I suggest you review it at some other time; you will have
plenty of other things to occupy you tonight. With best
regards.�

&nbsp;

I finished reading the letter and looked up
to discover an almost naked Ekrana standing before
me. She was still veiled, of course. Emma broke into a fit of giggles at the
sight of my astonished look. I threw a cushion at her.

&nbsp;

I spoke to Ekrana.
�Do you speak English?� I asked.

&nbsp;

She nodded. A laughing Emma got to her feet
and ran to Ekrana�s side. She lifted the secretary�s veil
sufficiently to reveal the large rubber ball strapped into her mouth.

&nbsp;

�Can you take it off?� I asked. She nodded.
�Then do so, please.� She started to fumble with the strap, Emma helped her and
the ball came loose from her mouth. Ekrana quickly
adjusted her veil to cover her face properly again but allowed the scarf to
fall across her shoulder and down her back, giving me an uninterrupted view of
her naked body. I felt the least I could do was to look appreciatively. Her
skin was darker than that of many of the Kushtian�s I
had met and had the soft look of a girl not long out of adolescence. Her long
dark hair spilled out from around her veil; coal-black, almond shaped eyes
looked unflinchingly at me. �Did the Minister say how you should entertain me?�
I said.

&nbsp;

�Don�t be silly,� said Emma, leading Ekrana across to the couch. �This is Kushtia. She�ll have
been told to do whatever you please.�

&nbsp;

�Thank you, Madam,� said Ekrana, haltingly. �It is as you say.�

&nbsp;

�Madam!� I laughed, Emma was hardly older than the
secretary.

&nbsp;

�Don�t laugh,� Emma chided, �I am a wife
and so warrant the respect that becomes my status. Even if I wasn�t the wife of
the Kalinin�s
son, Kushtian girls are taught to hold a wife in almost as high esteem as a
man. And in Kushtia the training is rather more subtle than in your
�Preparation Centre� � they know that women respond to other things than having
the back of their heads rammed against the headboard of a bed. She�ll do
whatever I ask of her too.��� ��

&nbsp;

�She�ll go down on me?� 

&nbsp;

�Of course.�

&nbsp;

�Or you?� 

&nbsp;

�Yes, of course. Why? Would you like to
watch us play together?�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� I said, �of course.� 

&nbsp;

Emma gave a look of mock disapproval. �If
that would amuse you,� she responded. �But as Ekrana
is manacled, I should be chained as well. In Kushtia it is most improper for a
wife to appear less subservient than a femnyette - oh
sorry, it�s the word for an unmarried woman in Kushtian, it means �woman not
yet a wife� - if they are in the presence of a man. A Kushtian wife prides
herself on her subservience to her husband and those her husband chooses for
her.�

&nbsp;

�A fine idea,� I said. Emma led Ekrana towards an ornate chest. She lifted the lid to
display an array of chains, straps, whips, paddles and floggers.

&nbsp;

�This is called the Cabinet of the Marriage
Bed,� Emma explained. �By tradition, the father of the bride provides the
husband with the tools by which his new bride will be ruled. These were a present
from your Mr Clegg to my husband. Ekrana, please use
these wrist cuffs on me.� 

&nbsp;

Ekrana took the cuffs from Emma and fastened them about her wrists. As she
did so, she kissed each hand in turn. Emma, seeing my approval of the girls�
intimacy, encouraged her to continue. It did not take long until all three of
us were tangled together on the bed; the two girls pleasuring one another and
competing to see which could delight me more. I suppose I should have had some
feelings of guilt � what with leaving Tricia behind and all � but I have to say
I managed to overcome them. And after all I was only trying to get to grips
with Kushtian culture.

�

&nbsp;

Chapter 32 : Trade Ministry

&nbsp;

�Minister,�
I said, nursing a hangover from a great deal too much Kushtian beer and
probably an excess of unaccustomed exercise with Ekrana
and Emma. �I hope you won�t think me rude if I do not stay long; especially
after your generosity with your secretary. My flight leaves shortly and much
though I have enjoyed my visit here I must return to England if I am to put in hand the
preparations for implementing our agreement.�

&nbsp;

�Of
course, of course,� the Trade Minister replied. �I just wanted you to see a
couple of things before you went back. Firstly, I thought you might like to see
my new house guest.�

&nbsp;

I
assumed he was talking about Cora and, in that, I was right. He showed me out
of his lounge and down a corridor towards the back of the house. Steps ran down
to a basement area. Along one wall were four identical doors, three were open
showing small, windowless, rooms beyond. The fourth was closed. The Minister
took a key from the pocket of his jacket and unlocked the door. It swung slowly
open. Inside, sat on the floor, chained by her neck to the wall and
recognisable by her long dark hair in spite of her veil, was Cora Argyll. The
growling grunt that she gave as the door swung back told me that she was still
gagged behind her veil. Her wrists and ankles were shackled but the veil, the
gag and the chains were all that she wore. The only other thing in the small
room was a small bucket.

&nbsp;

�I
thought you might like to see my newest acquisition,� the Minister said. �In
Kushtia there is a long tradition of public officials having concubines. The
pressures of public duty are onerous. Holders of public office need to be able
to relax. They have their wives to raise their families and run their
households but for more recreational female company, a Minister needs more than
wives.� Cora grunted her objections furiously. �They are a great aid to the
process of public administration. I may have a difficult meeting. Perhaps one
of my colleagues is trying to pursue a misguided policy. There may be a
complicated matter of legislation to consider. All these things are best dealt
with if the Minister is relaxed and in good humour. Ministerial concubines
provide an important public benefit. I have no difficulty in justifying to myself
the cost to the public purse. And since we expect to do much business with your
country, I felt it would be only helpful to have one of your compatriots in my
service.� 

&nbsp;

�She
seems a little less than willing, Minister,� I said, noting how Cora was now
almost growling through her gag.

&nbsp;

�It
will be a while,� the Minister said with an air of regret, �until she can take
up her duties fully. I fear that western girls need much help in learning our
local ways. They have many mistaken ideas and it takes time for them to see the
value of the Kushtian culture. Fortunately Kushtian tradition says that once a
woman has been chosen as a concubine the man can take his pleasures with her as
he will, so she can still be of use as she becomes better acquainted with her
new role. Of course, a concubine is not a wife; she still has to wear her
veil.�

&nbsp;

�I
trust that will not be too much of an inconvenience.�

&nbsp;

�It
has not proved so, this far,� said the Minister with a grin. �In spite of her
relative inexperience, she has managed to bring me pleasure on four occasions
since she arrived here yesterday. I have managed to find parts of her body unencumbered
by her veil. She is most lively in her service. She feigns resistance of course
but that is only to be expected. She knows a Kushtian man values the sense of
conquest. I can tell she will soon be able to fulfil many of her duties. An excellent start.�

&nbsp;

The
Minister walked across to where Cora was sitting on the floor. He grabbed her
by the hair and pulled her to her feet. She grunted and tried to break free. �I
wanted to ask your advice.�

&nbsp;

�Of
course Minister,� I responded.

&nbsp;

�Do
you think I should have one or both of her nipples pierced?� He pushed her
trailing veil back to give us both a clear view of her breasts. They were well
rounded; firm, like small grapefruit. 

&nbsp;

I
gave the matter some thought. I hardly considered myself an expert but I was
enjoying the prospect of the almost naked Cora. She tried to wriggle free of
the Minister�s grasp. He laughed and wrenched her head back. �Both, I think
Minister. I think she would look well carrying rings or perhaps small bells to
announce her presence.�

&nbsp;

�A
fine thought, my friend, a fine thought. I shall take your advice.� Cora
groaned in despair. The Minister took no notice and spun her around. �And her
owner�s mark? Here?� he asked pointing first to Cora�s left buttock and then to
the right. �Or here?�

&nbsp;

�You
might consider marking her belly,� I ventured entering into the spirit of the
discussion in aw ay that Cora evidently found as disturbing as the Minister
found engaging. �If you intend to use her mainly from the front, I think it is
nice to see the mark there. Like the badge in the middle of a car�s steering
wheel.�

&nbsp;

The
Minister laughed. �A splendid idea. I shall suggest
the Minister of Transport does the same with his concubines.�� 

&nbsp;

I
thought back to the circumstances of Cora�s acquisition. �Will it not be
difficult keeping her here? With your contacts with the
Ambassador and so on.�

&nbsp;

�No.
She will not remain here in Kolin. I have a country
estate. She will take up residence there at first. There is adequate
accommodation for her while she is learning her place. Not perhaps as
comfortable as here in town, but she will be able to learn her new skills,
un-distracted by the concerns of the city.���


&nbsp;

I
looked at the bare concrete walls of the room that Cora currently occupied and
wondered what could be less comfortable. Cora gave a gagged moan of distress to
the Minister�s amusement. �You see, she retains her spirit. That is good. Rest
quietly girl, you will have the opportunity to pleasure me later, do not
worry.� Cora squealed in frustrated defiance. The Minister grinned again.

&nbsp;

�Come
now,� he said. �We must not disturb her meditation any longer. A new concubine
must spend much time in thoughts of how she will bring her man pleasure. And
besides there was something else I wanted to show you.� 

&nbsp;

He
led the way back upstairs and back into his lounge. From behind his desk he
pulled out a battered black brief case. �It was this,� he said.

&nbsp;

I
took the case from him and looked at it. On the flap it carried an embossed
version of the United
  Kingdom�s coat of arms, the lion and unicorn
rampant, supporting a shield and helmet. �Ms Argyll�s case, I imagine,� I said.
I had seen her with something similar when we first met.

&nbsp;

�We
assume so. It was found in the back of her car.�

&nbsp;

�Should
it not be returned to the Ambassador?� I asked.

&nbsp;

�Yes,
yes, I am sure it should but I thought you might like to see inside it first.�

&nbsp;

I
undid the catch and pulled back the flap. I tipped the contents of the bag onto
the table in front of me. The collection of file folders was hardly surprising.
What was more unexpected was the contents of a small
leather pouch � six cable ties, a pair of handcuffs, a roll of duct tape, a
hypodermic syringe in a case and a series of grainy, black and white
photographs of me.

&nbsp;

�Ah,�
I said. �I see what you mean.�

&nbsp;

�I
take it you were unaware of Ms. Argyll�s intentions?�

&nbsp;

�You
take it correctly. I think I need to discuss this development with Mr Clegg
when I get back. I trust it won�t interfere with your enjoyment of your new
concubine.�

&nbsp;

The
Minister laughed �Not at all, not at all, Mr Ross. We have a saying here, �a
concubine�s life begins with her man�. The young lady�s past is of no concern
to me. We must both look to the future. Of course we will let Mr Clegg know if
she should happen to mention any piece of information that might indicate the
reason for her interest in you. However, you had better be careful between here
and the airport. To assist you, my friend the Interior Minister has arranged to
provide an escort. I suggest you take the Ministerial car from here. I will have
your bags collected from the hotel. We take a dim view of those who seek to
interfere with our trading partners.� 

&nbsp;

�Thank
you Minister,� I said, relieved.

&nbsp;

�And
here is your escort.� A woman police officer came in. Well stacked, I thought.
I wondered if she was the �34C� I�d left the Wonderbra
for. �Sergeant Dobranin here will see you get safely
to the airport. She�s been doing an excellent job for us, helping with our
crack down on drunken driving,� said the Minister, so I realised, of course,
that she was.

&nbsp;

Sergeant
Dobranin smiled. She took her sunglasses from her
shirt pocket and put them on.

&nbsp;

�Splendid,�
I said as Dobranin led the way to the Minister�s Hummvee. �You must tell me about your latest arrest.� I
hoped that what she had to say would amuse me. I wanted something to take my
mind off the Rachel situation and what looked like my own problems as well. ��

&nbsp;

&nbsp;



Chapter 33 : Back To Earth

&nbsp;

The Air Kushtia return flight wasn�t much
better than the flight out. I emerged from the Arrivals Channel in Heathrow
Terminal 3 to see Harry waiting. �Hi,� I said.

&nbsp;

He grunted, �I was your wet nurse, now I�m
your babysitter. Clegg thought you might need a lift.�

&nbsp;

�Well thanks. I�m sure I�m fine,� I
responded.

&nbsp;

Harry grabbed one of my bags. �Not with your track record. Anyway you need to be in the
Whitechapel office.� He pointed to a car parked outside the terminal. I got in
the back, Harry followed. Tricia was driving.

&nbsp;

�Hi,� she said, �welcome back. Good trip?�
She wasn�t too effusive, neither of us liked to parade our relationship while
we were at work. It wasn�t like it was a secret or anything; we just preferred
to get on with the day job when we were working.

&nbsp;

�Thanks,� I said. �Yeah
sure. It�s a very different place.�

&nbsp;

Tricia pulled out of the airport and down
onto the M4, heading into London.
�How�s things?� I asked Harry.

&nbsp;

He grunted in response. �If you�re worried
about your writer we�ve got her back.�

&nbsp;

�Great,� I said, �Did she get far?�

&nbsp;

�No, not too far but we had a hell of a job
getting her back. She found a way to fuck up the chip in her collar. Seb�s still trying to work out how she did it. It meant we
couldn�t use tracers. We had to use dogs for fuck�s sake! We haven�t done that
for ages. You remember that farm we went to on your first pick up? We keep a
few there but they were definitely off-form. First work they�d done for a while
and too many dog biscuits, if you ask me.�

&nbsp;

I looked down at my own waist line. The
past few days hadn�t helped. The Kushtian�s
hospitality meant I�d put on a few pounds and the exercise with Emma and Ekrana hadn�t had enough of a compensating effect.

&nbsp;

�Still in some ways it was fun. It�s good
to go back to first principles occasionally. I haven�t had to do any field
tracking for a while. I guess she�d thought she�d be OK without the collar
chip, she didn�t go far. We were pretty certain she hadn�t got clear, we�d have
heard through some of Freddie�s contacts in the police if she�d got far and
that would got very complicated. We thought she was
probably holed up in the woods at the back of the Prep Centre; picked up some
tracks going through one of the gates � girlie shoes are a bit distinctive. We
thought she�d be waiting for the hue and cry to die down. So we put on a show,
moved a couple of squads through the woodland, crashing about and making a
noise with the dogs. Then we left things quiet for a day.�

&nbsp;

The car pulled off the M4. Unusually the
traffic was moving and we were soon heading on through Hammersmith and down the
Euston Road.
�And then she walked out?�

&nbsp;

�Not quite,� Harry went on, �but very
nearly. We left a few heat sensors around the woods and put in a couple of guys
with night vision goggles. They picked her up moving around near the northern
edge. Anyway to cut a long story short, they flushed her out with the dogs, we
had a team by the edge of wood and she took a tranquilliser dart in the butt as
she tried to track out towards the road along a hedge. Went
down as easy as you like. Well, apart from the yell of �No!� as she
realised she�d been hit. I had to discourage the guys from bringing her back
swinging by her wrists and ankles from a pole. They get a bit gung ho with
things like that. She�s back in storage now and Rick�s team are having a very
detailed discussion with her about just what has gone wrong with the prep
programme.�

&nbsp;

�How�s Freddie been about it?�

&nbsp;

�Surprisingly relaxed. But then it�s the first runner we�ve had in ages. I think maybe he
feels that you need one now and then to get people back on their toes. He
handed out a few ear blisterings though. People won�t
forget for a while. Plus the security teams have been having regular drills
again.�

&nbsp;

�They�ll not be happy with that.�

&nbsp;

�Well, maybe not but it�s the only way.
Anyhow, I hear you�ve been busy too.�

&nbsp;

I saw Tricia�s head give a twitch of
interest. �Just a pick up for the Trade Minister,� I said, not keen to discuss
Cora before I�d had a chance to show Freddie what I�d found in her case. �And I
didn�t have to do too much.�

&nbsp;

�Just as well given your previous
performances,� said Harry with a smirk. �If you�re going to be doing this sort
of thing you�ll need some training.�

&nbsp;

�I wasn�t planning on it become part of the
job description,� I said and looked out to see that we had arrived. Tricia
stopped the car outside the office in Whitechapel. Harry and I got out. I gave
Tricia a smile. She waved back and drove off. 

&nbsp;

We pushed passed a group of people on the
pavement. One of their number was holding forth waving at the surrounding
buildings. �And just here,� he said, �were plotted some of the most violent
crimes ever recorded against women.�

&nbsp;

I was looking over my shoulder, puzzled as
we made our way into the building. �Jack the Ripper Tour,� said Harry.

&nbsp;

�I was worried there for a minute,� I said,
�I thought someone had done too good a job promoting our activities.�

&nbsp;

Five minutes later I was in Clegg�s office.
Ellie was with him. �You�re going to find things a bit dull after Kushtia, I
suspect,� said Clegg.

&nbsp;

�Well everyone was very hospitable,� I
responded with a smile.

&nbsp;

�We got your writer back.�

&nbsp;

�So I hear. I suppose Seb�s
OK?�

&nbsp;

�Oh yes. I think he got over his encounter
with Sarah quicker than his encounter with me. They�ll all have learned a few
things from that.�

&nbsp;

�I guess so.�

&nbsp;

�And you were able to help out the Trade
Minister, I understand. He called me. He seemed very happy.�

&nbsp;

�I thought it was the right thing to do.�

&nbsp;

Ellie got to her feet, stubbed her
cigarette in Clegg�s ashtray and blew a stream of smoke from her cigarette in
the general direction of the window. �I�ll let you boys get on with talking
shop.� She said. �I�ve got some stuff to do.�

&nbsp;

�OK,� said Freddie.

&nbsp;

�Can I drop a license agreement off with
you later?� I asked. �It�s something the Kushtian�s
gave me. It�ll give us preferred supplier status out there.�

&nbsp;

Ellie gave me a pained look. �I can just
imagine what Kushtian legal documents are like. I�ll have a look at it but
heaven knows what we�ll have to do to make sure we�re properly covered.� 

&nbsp;

�Do what you can, Ellie,� Freddie chipped
in. �This could be good for us. If we�re not having to
invest I don�t think we�ll want to beat them up to hard on terms and
conditions. Let me know if there�s anything really troublesome.�

&nbsp;

�Sure,� said Ellie. �I�ll mug up on their
legal system. Larry, if you can drop the license by when you�ve finished here.�

&nbsp;

�Sure,� I said. Ellie left us. I turned
back to Clegg. �You said the Minister was happy.����� 

&nbsp;

�Well yes. It caused a few ripples in the
Diplomatic Corps, though. They tend to be a bit sensitive about that sort of
thing you know.�

&nbsp;

�Sorry. I hadn�t realised they were off
limits. She might have worked out what was going on, you know. I mean she
translated the whole thing with the Minister�s tongue hanging out and
practically dribbling on her.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, the Trade Minister mentioned that she
wasn�t the sharpest pencil in the box.�

&nbsp;

�There was one other thing.�

&nbsp;

�Uh huh?�

&nbsp;

�You hadn�t told me this was going to be
fucking dangerous.� I dumped Cora�s pouch on the table between us. Clegg opened
it and peered at the contents.

&nbsp;

�Of course it�s fucking dangerous,� he said
calmly. �To the best of my reckoning you�ve been involved in the abduction of
twenty two women � twenty three including your friend in Kushtia - since
joining us. You�re doing things that will mean some of our competitors feel a
bit more squeezed than they would like to. In this business they don�t just
write a letter to the local chamber of trade if they feel the competition is getting
a bit keen. I�d take it as a complement if I were you.� 

&nbsp;

I grunted, unconvinced. Clegg went on. �Still never mind about that now. I�ll get Harry to look at
it later. I want you to sit in on today�s executive committee meeting and give
us an update on the marketing projects.� 

&nbsp;

It was the first time I�d sat in on an
Exec. Clegg had handled the meetings up until then. 

&nbsp;

It was about as entertaining as these
things usually are � that is not at all, except for
the usual combination of aggression between peers and fawning to the boss. What
was interesting though was the extent to which some of my initial conceptions
seemed to be being borne out by data.

&nbsp;

Rick was there to run through what was
going on in the Prep Centre. He trotted out a series of statistics on cell
occupancy, time from intake to shipment and internal shipments versus external
shipments. He spent quite a while on the tightening up of security measures
after Rachel�s run. He seemed to be well on top of the logistical issues but
the numbers sounded like they were going the wrong way to me. Harry�s review of
field operations didn�t have any surprises and he seemed happy with the new
intake of trainees, which I assumed included Tricia. The CFO � I�d not met him
before - gave a run down on the finances and, while cash intake was down, costs
seemed to be under control. He was complaining that IT were
spending too much time on research projects and not enough on the new
accounting system. Freddie listened sympathetically and smiled at me. 

&nbsp;

Brian�s pitch on the situation in sales
didn�t get such an easy ride. Freddie had evidently asked him for some numbers
on average prices and on how they compared with the number of buyers present at
the sales. He hooked up his PC to the projector and started to run through an
interminable number of graphs, pie charts and other diagrams. The presentation
didn�t make encouraging viewing. As I had suggested; the
fewer the buyers, the lower the margins. And it was evident from Brian�s
data that the number of buyers had been steadily falling over the previous
year. What was worse, when Freddie pressed him, he didn�t appear to have any
thoughts on what to do about it. Freddie concluded the session with a �well
let�s hear if Marketing can get us out of this. Larry can you take us through
what you�ve been up to��

&nbsp;

Brian looked pretty pissed off as I got to
my feet. Elly, who had sat through the whole meeting
without saying a word, leant across and whispered something to Clegg. �Morning
everyone,� I said. �I�m going to have to apologise to those of you who were
looking forward to a real marketing presentation but I haven�t got any slides,
so no death by PowerPoint, I�m afraid. I just thought I�d talk things through
if that�s OK?�

&nbsp;

The rest of the meeting looked relieved.

&nbsp;

I ran through the SWOT analysis just as I
had with Freddie and then put a bit more detail on what I intended to do about
it. I didn�t mention the idea of closing down the Sales Centre,
I thought I�d leave that to Freddie at some other time. I didn�t go through any
of Rachel�s stuff as I hadn�t really had a chance to review it properly but I
gave them some feedback on the first experiences with using an account
management approach with the Kalinin; how the initial contact had led to the
acquisition of the five All Spice girls and then the extra six for the
ministers and the Jewel Questors project and not one
auction for any of them. And now there was the opportunity for an overall
contract with Kushtia. I ran the video and gave them a demonstration of the web
site. �Sorry if this has held up your accounting system,� I said to the
CFO.� 

&nbsp;

�No problem,� he said.� �This is good stuff, but we�re going to have
to work out how to fund it properly.�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� said Freddie, �I think you�re right.
We must give it some thought. Brian, you need to work out how you�re going to
support this too.� He scowled but said nothing.

&nbsp;

Back in my office I thought about the
meeting. I�d felt it went well although Brian had a bit of a hard time. I
didn�t really have time to worry about him though. There was an email for me
from Steve Glennis, forwarded from the encrypted area
of the member�s web site. �I�ve got that project for you, we talked about,� it
said. �I�ve been through the search facilities � great stuff, by the way � and
there isn�t anything I can find. Give me a call when you�re free and I�ll run
you through it.�

&nbsp;

I looked at my watch, six o�clock in the evening UK time. My body was somewhere over
Turkey if I thought about
it, for Steve on his Caribbean island it would
be two o�clock in the
afternoon. It was probably as good a time to call as any, I reckoned.

�

�Steve,� I said, �It�s
Larry. You said you might need some help.�

&nbsp;

Steve was as friendly as ever. I asked him
about his pony school. �That,� he said, �brings us right to the point.�

&nbsp;

�I�d have thought you should be able to
find suitable candidates on the site,� I said. �You
can specify the physical characteristics, hair colour, that sort of thing.�

&nbsp;

�No, that�s not the problem,� he said.
�That�s all fine. In fact I�ve put in a request through the site for a quote on
a couple of dark mares, just for a different look, you know. No, what this is
for is a carriage driver. I know the site picks up hobbies and interests but
this is a bit specialised, I�m looking for someone to drive a carriage for me
competitively and something to give the stables a bit of class, if you know
what I mean.�

&nbsp;

I grunted in response and then asked, �How
about looks?�

&nbsp;

�Well, she�ll need to be easy on the eye,
obviously, but nothing too specific in that direction. Just if you�re going
trawling in the British aristocracy don�t find me one of those women that looks more like a horse than the horses. When do you think
you can give me some ideas?�

&nbsp;

�We�ll need to do some research,� I said.
�Let me get back to you in a week with some ideas.�

&nbsp;

�That�ll be fine, Larry,� Steve said. �Gotta go now though. Just heard
the seaplane,�

&nbsp;

�OK,� I said, �talk to you soon.�

&nbsp;

Steve�s call was good news as far as I was
concerned. Clegg would be pleased that the new approach was generating business
through the web site and for custom commissions. I had the report from Rachel
to go through as well. At least she�d finished the reports on her interviews
with Sukie before she went over the wall. There were
pages of it.

&nbsp;

On the other hand, I was more concerned
about getting some sleep. After the flight back from Kushtia without any of the
comforts that I�d had on the return from the Caribbean,
I felt I was in need of a quiet evening. 

&nbsp;

That was until Tricia put her head around
the office door. �You look like you need a good feed,� she said. �Why don�t I
cook you something at the flat tonight?�

&nbsp;

All of a sudden it seemed like a good idea.
Even the comforts of Emma back in Kushtia seemed to have had something missing.
�Yeah, sure, why not.� I tossed her the keys. �I�ve
got some stuff to finish up here but I�ll be there by seven. Why don�t you go
on ahead?�

&nbsp;

She caught the keys, smiled, and said, �see you later,� as she left the office.

&nbsp;

Chapter
34 : A Messy Apartment

&nbsp;

As it happened she was wrong. It took me
longer than I thought to finish up. The traffic was lousy. I was feeling guilty
about how late it had got. It was almost nine o�clock.

&nbsp;

When I got back to the flat the front door
was ajar. �Naughty Tricia,� I thought, �anyone could get in.� It didn�t take me
a moment to realise that someone had, I hadn�t seen anything as bad since
Tricia trashed the bedroom during our practice burglary. It looked a similarly
messy job, done to impress. Well I was impressed. What was worse Tricia wasn�t
there.

&nbsp;

Something told me that calling the police
wasn�t a great idea but even so I was pretty wary about looking around. It didn�t
take too long to work out what had happened. You didn�t need a degree in
forensic science to work it out.

&nbsp;

It looked like whoever had made this mess
had snatched Tricia when she arrived and had hung onto her waiting for me to
turn up. Then they�d got bored or worried and gone, taking her with them. One
of the dining chairs had been dragged into the bedroom. There was the remains of duct tape strips around the bottom of
each of the front legs of the chair, she�d obviously been taped to the chair at
some point, one of her shoes lay beneath it. A screwed up wad of cloth and some
strips of tape were the remains of a gag that I guessed had been changed before
they took her away. A spent hypodermic lay in the rubbish from the upended
waste basket. A heap of tissues soaked in blood suggested that someone hadn�t
had it to easy. I liked to think it was whoever had snatched her. The core of a
roll of duck tape under the chair suggested that in spite of that they�d got
their own way. Her handbag had been upended on the bed, its contents spread
around. 

&nbsp;

I phoned Harry. �I need some help, I said
as calmly as I could. �Can you get over here?�

&nbsp;

To say that Harry wasn�t happy when he saw
the shambles would be putting it mildly. Certainly his exclamations as he
rummaged through the muddle left me feeling sympathetic towards anyone that he
linked to the events. He was even less amused when he heard about Cora and the
events in Kushtia. �So you fucking knew you were at risk? And you let Tricia
walk in here without warning her?�

&nbsp;

�Well, I�d only just told Clegg about it and .. �

&nbsp;

�Fucking great. One of my team is sitting fuck knows fucking where and all because
you hadn�t got round to cosying up with her and
letting her know just what you�d been fucking about at in the mountains.�

&nbsp;

�Harry, it�s not like that.�

&nbsp;

�In just what fucking way do you think it�s
not fucking like that?�

&nbsp;

�Harry, it�s not going to help us, is it?
I�m as keen as you are to see her back.�

&nbsp;

He seemed to calm down a bit. �Yeah, well,
OK sure. Look, who knew you were in Kushtia?�

&nbsp;

�I dunno, a few people around the business. I hadn�t made a secret
about it around here. I�ve been trying to let people know how well this stuff
has been going you know. Nobody outside the business apart
from the Kushtians, though, as far as I know.�

&nbsp;

�So how did this Cora know to turn up to
meet you in Kolin?�

&nbsp;

�I guess the Kalinin spoke to the Ambassador or the Trade
Minister asked for her.� I told him the story of my first meeting with Cora at
the hotel and the subsequent meeting with the Trade Minister

&nbsp;

�But he didn�t need a translator did he? So
why would he have bothered? Although he obviously had the hots for her already.�

&nbsp;

�But he didn�t need to invite her along to
the meeting to set her up did he?�

&nbsp;

�No, no, I guess not.�

&nbsp;

�I�ll see what I can find out. My
suggestion would be to stay out of the way for a while. Go find somewhere quiet
where no one from this world is likely to find you. Check your mobile message
box but do it from a landline. I�ll get Freddie to leave you a message when
it�s safe to come out.�

&nbsp;

�I�d like to help to get Tricia back.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah well. I don�t think that�s a great idea unless there�s no alternative. I
mean, I know you�ve come on a bit but this could all get a bit messy and if
there�s going to be any mess with one of my team then I�ll sort it out. Just
lose yourself, right?�

&nbsp;

�Hang on. Look, if they�ve snatched her to
get at me, they�re going to turn up with some sort of demand aren�t they? I
need to be around for that. If they can�t reach me what will they do to
Tricia?�

&nbsp;

�Well, I dunno.�
Harry was considering my remarks when Freddie walked into the chaos.

&nbsp;

�This is a mess, Harry,� he said. I didn�t
think he meant my flat.

&nbsp;

�Yeah, I�m going to fix it,� said Harry.

&nbsp;

�Larry,� Freddie said, seeing my discomfort,
�I think you need to let Harry handle this.�

&nbsp;

We were debating the point when my mobile
beeped to say I had a new text message. It was from Tricia�s number. �Larry,�
it said, �if you�ve been to the flat you�ll know what this is about. Keep H
&amp; F out of it. TXT U L8R. T.�

&nbsp;

I showed it to Harry &amp; Freddie. �Guess
I can�t really stay out of this.�

&nbsp;

Freddie looked at the phone and agreed
reluctantly. �Well, it looks as if you�re in it if we like it or not.� Harry
snorted. �I guess you�ll just have to pick up the messages and play it as it
seems.� Suddenly he seemed to be loosing interest. �No point in us complicating things. We�ll only fall over one another.
Maybe we�ll be able to help.� Harry tried to interrupt. �No, Harry, I think
we�ll back off on this one. Leave it to Larry. It�s his problem. We�ve got
enough to do.�

&nbsp;

I wasn�t happy with that and Harry didn�t
look happy either but Freddie was insistent. I didn�t see why Freddie was
washing his hands of it. I had wanted to be involved with helping to get Tricia
back but now it looked like I was on my own. I hadn�t the faintest idea what I
was going to do. I�d have to play it by ear.

&nbsp;

�Now,� said Clegg, changing the subject,
�have you been able to do anything about that request from Steve Glennis? I wouldn�t want us to fall down on that one.�

&nbsp;

I glowered at him. �Freddie, I�ve got other
things on my mind.�

&nbsp;

�Sure, sure,� he said �but you need to keep
busy. You can�t do anything about this for a while � see what you can do for
Steve. Got to look after the customers.�

&nbsp;

Chapter
35 : Tracking Tricia

&nbsp;

I hated to admit it but Freddie was right.
There wasn�t much else I could do after I had put the flat back together again
so I went in to the office as usual. I reckoned the kidnappers would find me if
they had something to say.

&nbsp;

I tried to do some work on the Glennis request. I�m not a big fan of desk research, it�s
pretty dull to start with, but sometimes it�s the only way to find out what you
need to know. Normally I do this stuff to analyse markets; this time it was to
look for a potential target but the principles are the same. You aim to gather
up the right sources and then work through them looking for clues, linking
things together. Since Freddie had OK�d my thoughts on including a focus on
British middle and upper class targets as one of our market niches, I�d been
building up a library of stuff that might help us understand the market better.
I�d got a pile of back numbers of �Country Life� and �Horse and Hound� and a
copy of �Debrett�s Peerage &amp; Baronettage�.
For this project I added a few copies of Carriage Horse � the magazine for the
British Horse Driving Trials Association. After that it was a matter of
flogging through them. Looking at Carriage Horse for accounts of event winners and
championship holders; checking out the �Lady This� or �Honourable That� in Debrett�s and rooting through the other magazines for
pictures that might give some clue as to whether they passed the Steve Glennis �can I tell if this is a woman or a horse?� test.

&nbsp;

At the end of it all I had four possible
candidates. The favourite, mainly on looks � not in the least bit horsy, I
thought - was Lady Angela Marchmont. I dashed off an
email to Research to do me a full profile of her and the other three. It
worried me a bit. I�d worked all morning and I�d hardly thought about Tricia at
all.

&nbsp;

Rick phoned to give me an update on Rachel.
They�d had quite a few �assisted conversations� as he termed it. He reckoned
they had quite a good fix on what had gone on as a result. Turns out she�d
studied psychology at college � they�d done a module on some of the brain
washing techniques used in the cold war. It was primitive stuff then but
apparently we�d used the ideas as the basis for our initial preparation.
Apparently Rachel was a big fan of the Ipcress File �
a book by Len Deighton and a movie in the sixties
with Michael Caine. In the movie, Caine�s
character distracts himself from the brainwashing by using pain � he drives a
nail into the palm of his hand during the brainwashing sessions. Rachel had
been using the same approach, but without leaving any marks. She�d retreated
into the pain and humiliation of her rapes, counting them off inside her head.
They�d got her to vocalise it under sedatives. Rick said he�d play me the
tapes. He thought that now he could fix her. It was good news, I guessed, but I
was still thinking about my own problems. Getting the writer back on stream
wasn�t very high up the list. 

&nbsp;

My mobile bleeped again later that evening.
It was Tricia�s number again, another text. �Dont 4get the shopping. We need some wine.� I
guessed that this was setting up some sort of a meeting and the local
supermarket seemed as safe as anywhere as far as I was concerned. I needed some
food anyway.

&nbsp;

I took a trolley at the door and started
making my way up and down the aisles. I got as far as the wine. I�d picked up a
couple of bottles of Californian wine when a woman turned into the same aisle.
As I went to move along the aisle she pushed her trolley across mine blocking it
in. She smiled at me. �You look like you�re looking for something,� she said.

&nbsp;

�I�m told supermarkets are a great place to
pick up women,� I said, �would you know anything about that?�

&nbsp;

�Tricia said you had a sense of humour.�
She peered at the bottles in my trolley. �You�d be better off going for a
Chilean or South African,� she said, �you�re really paying for the label with
those.� 

&nbsp;

�I don�t drink enough wine to bother with
cheap bottles,� I said. 

&nbsp;

She ignored me. �Are there any of Harry�s
team around?� she asked.

&nbsp;

�How would I know?� I said. �You�d be more
likely to spot them than I am. He�s pretty pissed about this. So is Freddie.
But I haven�t seen anything of them for a while.�

&nbsp;

�No,� she said, not even bothering to look around.
�They seem to have left you to swing. Do you want to see Tricia free?�

&nbsp;

�Sure but I�m guessing that might be
hazardous to my health. I�d like to be a hero but I find it a bit of a
challenge.�

&nbsp;

�All right,� she said, �here�s the deal.
Your lady is sitting someplace where she won�t come to any harm. We go for a
ride in my car and talk to someone. You get to see her.�

&nbsp;

�Talk?�

&nbsp;

�Talk.�

&nbsp;

�That still sounds hazardous to my health.
Why don�t they just give me a phone call? You�ve got my number.� Another woman
turned into the aisle pushing a trolley that held enough shopping to feed a
small army for a month. 

&nbsp;

�Excuse me,� she said pushing between us
and picking up a twelve pack of beer before walking on.

&nbsp;

I watched as she disappeared around the end
of the aisle. The woman I was talking to just smiled. �And the alternative?� I said.

&nbsp;

�Alternative?� the woman looked puzzled.

&nbsp;

�Usually there�s an alternative. You do
this or we�ll do that?�

&nbsp;

�Oh, yes, sorry. Well, if you put it like
that. I guess my contact can take out their disappointment on her. That might
not be pleasant.�

&nbsp;

I was beginning to feel backed into a
corner, which I supposed was the idea, but I didn�t want to take more chances
than I needed to. �You won�t mind if I just check whether or not you�re
carrying a weapon? It�s just that I�ve had a number of unpleasant experiences
with women in recent times.�

&nbsp;

�Help yourself,�
she said. �I�m sure that it�s not uncommon for two people meeting like this to
become entangled in an intimate embrace.�

&nbsp;

She was right, of course. This wasn�t the
place for a conventional frisk down but there were other ways to achieve the
same result. I pushed her back against the rack of wine bottles in a reasonable
simulation of a passionate grapple. I ran my hands down her body and across her
tits. She pushed back against me, helping out and no doubt looking for just the
sort of things I was looking for. I groped beneath her skirt, running my hands
up the inside of her thighs. She gave a surprised start and pressed her lips
against mine. I pushed my tongue between her lips. She kissed me back
enthusiastically. Satisfied that she was carrying nothing
that might cause me any problems, apart from a well built chest. I
backed away.

&nbsp;

�Satisfied?� she asked. �Only I thought you
might have found something in my fillings, the way your tongue was going.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah,� I said. �That�s fine.� I looked up
to see two old ladies peering disapprovingly at us from the other end of the aisle.
�Maybe we�d better go for that ride. I�m feeling more heroic by the minute.� I
turned my trolley towards the check out. �Where are we going then?�

&nbsp;

�I shouldn�t bother with the wine,� she
said. �There�s plenty there if you fancy a drink.� We both left our trolleys
and headed out to the car park. �Now I think we were going for a drive.� She
gestured towards a dark saloon car. I followed her to it. She opened the door
to the back. �My friend here will keep you company on the drive.� A smartly
dressed woman beckoned me inside with a smile that held no warmth at all. I
slid onto the bench seat alongside her with considerable trepidation. The car
pulled away.

&nbsp;

The woman beside me in the back seat handed
a scarf to me. �I wonder if you�d mind wearing this� she said, passing me a
scarf.

&nbsp;

�Around my neck?� I asked ingenuously.

&nbsp;

�A blindfold,� she said. �If
you don�t mind.� I didn�t see how it was likely to make things worse so
I did as she asked. �Thank you,� she said, politely. �That�s most helpful.�

&nbsp;

We drove for an hour or more, I guessed.
There wasn�t any conversation. Then the car stopped. My back seat companion
pulled off the blindfold. We were already inside a garage. I heard the door
sliding shut behind us. The woman from the supermarket opened the door of the
car and we both got out. She pointed to a door at the end of the garage.
�Through there,� she said. I opened it and went through into a darkened room. I
wasn�t really surprised when the door shut behind me with the disturbing clunk
of a lock closing. It was pitch black.

&nbsp;

It became brighter slowly as two red lamps
in the ceiling began to glow. As the lights went up it became obvious that I
was in a well equipped dungeon. The walls were lined with padded red leather,
racks to one side held a selection of whips, tawses
and floggers while pegs on the end wall held hanks of rope in various
thicknesses and colours. I heard a quiet groan from above and behind me.

&nbsp;

Swinging close to the ceiling, out of my
reach, was a ball shaped steel cage. The cage was locked shut with a huge
padlock. Inside, naked, shackled and ring gagged, struggled a helpless and
indignant Tricia. She became more animated as she saw me but I couldn�t make
any sense of her distorted speech. Wires ran from clamps on her nipples and
labia to a small pedestal beside a door. I was angered by what I saw but it was
obvious I wouldn�t get anywhere without a key to the padlock. I was staring up
at her as I heard a door opening behind me. I turned around. 

&nbsp;

A doorway on the other side of the dungeon
swung open.

&nbsp;

Standing in the door way was the figure of
a woman clad in a suit of skin tight, black leather. The suit was criss-crossed
with leather straps that emphasised her ample breasts. Over it she wore a
waist-cinching corset. Her face was covered by a mask of the same black
leather. From the back of her head erupted a pony tail wig of exaggerated blondness. She was carrying a heavy whip, wearing stilt
heeled, knee length boots and stood with her hands on
her hips confronting me. A strap on dildo rose with exaggerated tumescence from
her crotch giving her the look of a female Priapus.

&nbsp;

�You�ve caused me a lot of problems, Mr
Ross,� she said in a gravelly, gruff, voice that
suggested a lifetime�s use of cigarettes and whisky.

&nbsp;

�Problems?� I said. �I can�t think how.�

&nbsp;

�You activities for Mr Clegg,� she said,
huskily. �Let us say, I don�t entirely approve of your approach to the market.
It interferes with those of my own businesses. I am sure you understand that
this is a world in which the status quo is so easily disrupted.�

&nbsp;

�I�m not sure I understand,� I said.
�There�s enough business to go around if I believe my research. The problem is
supply not demand.�

&nbsp;

The woman gave a grunt and ignored my remark.
�I though that you should have the opportunity to see that your young lady is
in good hands.� She gestured to the cage. �But her future well being depends a
lot on your suggesting to Mr Clegg that he changes his approach to the market.
We�d be much happier if he went back to something more traditional.�

&nbsp;

�I don�t think Mr Clegg is very amenable to
suggestions about his business from outsiders.�

&nbsp;

�I�m sure but I�d like you to give him
this,� the leather clad, masked woman passed a sealed envelop to me. �Now if
you go back through that door, she gestured to the way I had come in.

&nbsp;

�My girls will take you back.� She turned
towards Tricia. �Say good-bye to Mr Ross, dear,� she growled, turning a knob on
the pedestal beside her.

&nbsp;

Tricia bleated in pain as an electric shock
stabbed at her nipples and labia. I started towards the dominatrix. �Oh, no, Mr
Ross,� she said huskily, pulling a pistol from a drawer in the pedestal. �Definitely not. Now do take that envelope to Freddie or it
really will be goodbye to Tricia and not �au revoir�.
And I�m sure you wouldn�t want that.�

&nbsp;

I looked down at the envelope and gave a
last look at Tricia in the cage. She whimpered into her gag. Fuming I turned
towards the door. My chaperone was waiting with the blindfold.

&nbsp;

Chapter
36 : A Legacy or Trussed

&nbsp;

Harry listened sympathetically to my
account of my trip to the dungeon. He looked across at Freddie who was sitting
back with his feet up on his desk, staring away and out through the window,
apparently disinterested. The envelop and paper lay
discarded on Clegg�s desk, ignored.� As I
concluded he swung himself around to face me. 

&nbsp;

�Fine, fine,� he said.

&nbsp;

�With respect, Freddie,� I responded, �it
isn�t fine by my books. What are we going to do?�

&nbsp;

�Do?� said
Freddie. �Oh, I�m not sure we need to do anything. Well not about the dungeon
anyway, not right now. I think I know what�s going on. If that letter was meant
to irritate me, it has certainly done so. The only problem is that it also
confirms what I suspected. I think we may know where young Tricia is. Harry
done some research haven�t you?� Harry nodded with a
grim smile. �And we have a little job set up.�

&nbsp;

�I thought you were leaving me to get on
with this?� I said.

&nbsp;

�Larry, you don�t want to believe
everything I say. I don�t even always believe me, myself. Now I am assuming you
want to join in with this?�

&nbsp;

Harry leant forward with a conspiratorial
air. �You remember that first burglary you came out with Tricia and me on?� he
said. I nodded. �Well, I think we need to go on another.�

&nbsp;

�We�re going to rescue her?�

&nbsp;

�No, not exactly,� said Freddie. �There�s
some collateral I want to pick up first. Just in case of any problems.�

&nbsp;

�Does this help Tricia?� I asked.

&nbsp;

�We think so. Maybe.
Certainly it�ll make me feel better about things,� Freddie said. They wouldn�t
explain any more but I trusted their judgement. I certainly hadn�t come up with
any ideas.

&nbsp;

A day later, we ended up outside of an
office in a run down building not far from our Whitechapel office. The dimpled
glass panel on the door carried some old fashioned black and gold lettering.
�Shuster, Siegel &amp; Kent,� it said, �Solicitors &amp; Commissioners for
Oaths�. 

&nbsp;

I took one look at the threadbare carpet
outside the door and the damp stain spreading from a corner of the window frame.
�Super,� I said, �really super.�

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry about it,� said Freddie.
�We�re only borrowing it. It�s just what we need for this job.�

&nbsp;

Clegg knocked on the door. A voice from
inside called, �It�s open. Turn the handle.� Freddie led the way. The girl sitting
at the desk looked up, evidently surprised by the idea of customers. �Uhhuh?� she asked. I�d known women that were more
articulate with a two inch rubber ball in their mouth.

&nbsp;

Clegg persevered. �Good afternoon.�

&nbsp;

The girl sat with her arms folded. �They�re
not here. None of them. Mr Shuster�s out. Mr Siegel�s
away and Mr Kent
is not coming in this week.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, dear,� said Freddie, at his most
conciliatory, �I had hoped to be able to consult with one of your team. Is it
really just yourself here?�

&nbsp;

�Oh, what? Well. No. There�s her.�

&nbsp;

�Her?�

&nbsp;

�She�s their para
� whatsit. Parallel?�

&nbsp;

�Para-legal?�

&nbsp;

�S�wot I said. Miss Lane, she is.
But they don�t usually let her talk to anyone.�

&nbsp;

�I�m sure she�ll be able to help,� Clegg said
patiently, �Even if it�s just to suggest whether Mr Kent, Mr Siegel or Mr
Shuster would be best able to help us with our problem. Perhaps you could show
us through.�

&nbsp;

�S�pose
so. You�d better come through.� She got up and
showed us past her desk, not towards either of the
three large glass panelled doors behind her but to a solid wooden door between
two enormous filing cupboards. Whereas each of the glass panelled doors
proclaimed the identity of their occupants in gold lettering there was simply a
card pinned to this door with the word �Lane� handwritten on it in felt tipped
pen. The receptionist opened it without knocking. The office�s occupant didn�t
seem surprised to be disturbed without warning. �Gentlemen for you,� said the
receptionist.�� 

&nbsp;

The smartly dressed girl behind the desk
looked up with a smile. �Hullo,� she said. �How can I help?� The smile turned
to a look of alarm as she watched Clegg pull a gun from his jacket. In the same
moment Harry had one hand over the receptionist�s mouth and another around her
waist, pulling her back against him and stifling her cries.

&nbsp;

�We need to borrow your offices for a
while,� Clegg said. �I do hope you won�t mind.� The girl�s hands flew to her
mouth. The receptionist was kicking spiritedly against Harry�s hold. He swung
her around and slammed her against a rack of files. File boxes fell to the
floor with a crash. Her struggles subsided a bit. 

&nbsp;

I knew what to do. I took the reel of tape
from my pocket, grabbed the girl in the chair by the wrists and taped them to
the arms of her seat. A wad of sponge followed the tape from my pocket. I
pushed it into her resisting mouth and taped over it. I taped each of her
ankles over to the legs of the chair and did the same with her knees. It left
her a bit exposed; she didn�t look happy with the way that Freddie was checking
out her legs.� 

&nbsp;

Harry wrestled the receptionist to the
floor. She was still struggling, squealing and kicking as he wrenched her
wrists behind her to tape them together. He didn�t seem bothered by her
efforts. He taped her ankles as he had done her wrists and then ran a short
strip of tape between wrists and ankles bending her backwards in a vicious hog
tie. He wound more tape around her arms and chest.

&nbsp;

We finished the two of them off with pads
over their eyes, wax ear plugs and tape to keep it all in place; there was no
need to bother them with what we were up to. Not that I knew what was going on
anyway. I still didn�t see how this was helping to get Tricia back.

&nbsp;

It was a little while later when we�d
installed ourselves in Shuster�s office that Clegg�s four guests arrived. Two
of them were women in their mid-forties, two of them young girls. The two older
ones looked rather similar; both carried themselves with the air of women that
had gone through life without too many problems and seemed as if they felt that
their future lives should continue in the same vein.

&nbsp;

�Ah, excellent. Come in,� said Clegg, waving them through into Shuster�s office.
�Come in.�

&nbsp;

The taller of the two women peeled off her
gloves. �I hope this isn�t going to take too long,� she said.

&nbsp;

�No, no, I don�t think so,� Clegg
responded. The two girls were nosing around the office, managing to combine an
air of curiosity with a sense of utter boredom. �Do please sit down, though.�
The two women did so. The two girls continued to prowl.

&nbsp;

The taller of the two girls picked up a
paperweight from the desk. �Don�t do that Beth,� the woman said to the girl. �I
am sorry,� she said to Clegg. �Now what was it you wanted? Something about a
legacy, you said.�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� said Clegg. �I just must make sure
that you are the individuals concerned. You have the necessary identification?�

&nbsp;

�Oh yes,� the woman said, rummaging in her
handbag. She pulled out four passports. �This is me, Alice,� she said passing
one over. �My sister, Carol here and my two daughters, Beth
and Ella.� Clegg smiled at the two girls. They both scowled back,
evidently irritated at being dragged into some dusty office by their mother.

&nbsp;

�Ah, good,� said Clegg examining the passports.
�These are fine. And I can see they confirm the girls are of legal age � it
makes everything so much simpler, you understand.�

&nbsp;

�Quite,� said the woman. 

&nbsp;

�Now this legacy relates to an individual,
her siblings and her immediate descendants. Can I confirm that is yourselves.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, that�s right. This is my only sister
and my only children.

&nbsp;

�I see. Good, that seems to be in order.
Well, as I explained the legacy is to the wife of the purchaser of this
particular property, 64 Lisson Way. It�s a little
curious, I will admit, for someone to leave money in this way but not unknown.
Oh, you did keep this confidential, didn�t you? As I said, the will clearly
states that the wife�s husband must not be informed. I think the individual
concerned was particularly keen to see that women had a source of income
completely independent of their husbands.�

&nbsp;

�Of course. We didn�t wish to do anything to jeopardise the possibility of
gaining the inheritance.� Alice said bluntly.

&nbsp;

�Excellent,� said Clegg. �Well then it�s
just a matter of providing proof of ownership of the property. Do you have the
details?�

&nbsp;

Alice passed across an envelope. Clegg opened it and pulled out some
papers. �Fine,� he said, examining them, �that�s fine. And this property was
acquired by your husband recently?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, that�s right. Well, in fact I didn�t
really know about it until you contacted me. I found the details in his desk. I
can�t think why he was being so secretive.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, I expect he was hoping to use it as an
investment. Many of the properties in that area are bought and then rented out.
Perhaps he wanted to surprise you?� Alice looked
sceptical.

&nbsp;

There was the sound of a heavy thump. It
had obviously come from Ms Lane�s
office. �If you�ll excuse me,� I said. �We�re having some alterations done. I
had asked them to make sure we were not disturbed but, well, I am sure you know
how it is�. I�ll just go and deal with it.� 

&nbsp;

Clegg smiled and I left them to it. As I
suspected the noise had been caused by our other two guests attempting to
escape. Ms Lane
had managed to tip her chair over on its back which had evidently caused the
noise that I had heard. She�d made no progress in freeing herself though and
all she had to show for her efforts was a cut on the back of her head where she
had fallen against the radiator that ran beneath the window behind her. She
groaned as much in frustration as pain, I imagined, as I put her chair back on
its four legs.� I checked that the
receptionist was still helpless. The tape was still doing its job in her case
too. I made my way back to join Clegg, Harry and their guests. �All fine,� I
said. �Sorry about that.� The four women turned towards me. Freddie was
evidently happy to take advantage of the distraction. When they looked back at
Clegg they found themselves staring into the barrel of Clegg�s gun.

&nbsp;

�I am afraid I�ve misled you ladies.� The
four women gasped. Alice made to get to her feet
but Clegg shook his head and waved her back into her seat with the barrel of
his gun. �Would you be good enough to put these on please?� He tossed four
pairs of handcuffs onto the desk. �Beth, Ella, perhaps you could help your
mother and her sister,� Clegg said politely. The two girls stared at him, rigid
with terror. �Do it, you stupid cunts!� he barked.
�Hands behind your backs, you two,� he ordered Alice and Carol who were already
whimpering with fear. With the two older women secured, he had Beth handcuff
Ella before putting the cuffs on the last of the women himself. �Tape them up,�
he said turning to Harry, �and we�ll be on our way. Do you want to bring the
other two?�

&nbsp;

�I�m not bothered,� said Harry, as he
started to wrap tape across Carol�s mouth, �probably just a complication. Not
worth it, I�d say.�

&nbsp;

Freddie looked at me. �Any of your lot want them?� he asked. I shook my head; the more I did with
account clients the less need I saw for random pick-ups. �OK, make a bit of a
mess. Our hosts will think they�ve been turned over by ungrateful clients. Then
let�s get going,� said Freddie, grabbing the two daughters by the arms and
hustling them towards a back door that led out onto a fire escape. Harry
followed with Carol. I turned over a few files and pulled some drawers out of
the desks and cabinets. It�s surprising how much of a mess you can make quite
quickly. I grabbed hold of Alice and pushed her
along behind the others. Freddie led the way to one of our regular white vans
and our captives were soon installed in the back. Clegg shut the doors. 

&nbsp;

�Aren�t you going to blindfold them?� I
asked.

&nbsp;

�No point,� he said, climbing in to the
driving seat.

&nbsp;

�Why,� I asked as Clegg passed Harry the
envelope that Alice had given him. Harry waved
it in acknowledgement and headed off to his own vehicle. The van pulled away
with me in the front alongside Freddie, our cargo moaning quietly behind us.
�Where�s Harry off to? Where are we going?�

&nbsp;

�We�re taking them to their home,� said
Clegg, mysteriously without explaining about Harry. I sat back and wondered
just what it was Clegg was up to. Most of the kidnappings I had seen so far had
involved taking the captive away from their homes not the other way around. And
I still didn�t see how it was going to help Tricia.

Chapter 37 : Best Served Cold

&nbsp;

Clegg drove the van up to a comfortable
looking detached house just as night was falling. He tossed me Carol�s handbag.
�You�ll find a door key in there, I guess,� he said. �No point in busting the
door in if we don�t need to.�

&nbsp;

Sure enough I found a key and went off to
open the door while Freddie checked out our cargo. I went back to the van as
Clegg was dragging the two girls to the van�s tail board. �Cut the tape on
their ankles,� he said, �and we�ll get them inside.� 

&nbsp;

Soon all four women were in the hall of the
house, mmphing with shock at where they were.
�Through here, I think,� said Clegg, opening a door to the living room. He
pushed Alice and Carol inside. I followed with Beth and Ella. Freddie pushed
his two captives down on the settee and went to close the curtains. �There,� he
said, �nice and cosy.� He looked at his watch. �We�ve got some time, why don�t
we have some fun?� he said as he looked at his watch. He sat down between Alice
and Carol, running the barrel of his pistol up the legs of each in turn.

&nbsp;

I didn�t really understand what was going
on. Clegg was normally so measured and contained. Now he was showing a
rapacious side as he started to toy with Alice�s
blouse. �Looks like this little lady has quite nice tits.
I�m sure her daughters have too. Why don�t we see?�

&nbsp;

Beth and Ella started complaining at once.
Freddie hefted his gun and pushed the barrel up under the hem of Alice�s skirt, jamming it against her crotch. She gave a
terrified squeal. �Not a good idea, girlies,� said Freddie, �You wouldn�t want
Mummy to get hurt would you?� Then turning to me he said, �Undo their wrists,
old man, but leave their gags on. Get them stripped down to their underwear.� Carol
and Alice were wriggling and grunting their objections. Freddie jammed the gun
up against Alice still the harder and snarled at
Carol, �You�d better behave too.�

&nbsp;

I got the girls undressed down to bras and
pants. Beth struggled a bit. I had to slap her back into line before she�d
strip off� her
jeans and top. Ella was less trouble when she saw th e treatment her sister got. Freddie
to tie them up again so I taped each girl�s wrists together behind their backs
and then taped their elbows close together too. It made them whimper but
it gave Freddie a view of their tits that he seemed to appreciate. 

&nbsp;

�Very nice,� said Freddie, admiringly.
�They do take after their mother, don�t they? So well developed for what was it
Beth, 18? And Ella, 19? Firm and with a rather
agreeable fullness, I think we'll all agree. I wonder about Carol?� Freddie
grinned humourlessly. �Yes, let her get her top off will you?� I cut through
the tape around her wrists. Carol pulled off her sweater under threat from
Freddie�s gun and then took off her bra, fumbling with the catch behind her
back as Freddie continued to threaten Alice and the two girls. Carol's tits were
heavier than her sister�s with large, dark brown, areolas. Freddie looked
approving as he told her to come and kneel beside them and I taped her wrists
securely once again. Freddie was toying with Alice�s
tits through her blouse. �So many tits,� he said. �I�m spoilt for choice. The older women or the daughters. Ah, difficult decisions.
Ella you come here.�

&nbsp;

I pulled her up and pushed her towards
Clegg. The girl joined the three others beside Freddie. He grabbed her by the
back of her neck and pushed her to her knees. Without pausing he wrenched away
the tape that gagged her and pulled out the wad of cloth that filled her mouth.
�Stay quiet,� he warned, pushing the barrel of his gun between her lips. �Now
what you�re going to do for me is to see if we can�t get Aunty Carol�s tits to
perk up a bit. You�re going to kiss and nuzzle at them and see if Aunty Carol
likes that.� Ella gave a choked grunt of objection. Freddie thumbed back the
hammer on the gun. Ella gave a muffled squeal. Alice
tried to struggle away from Clegg. He grinned at their ineffectual protests,
pulled the pistol barrel from Ella�s mouth and jerked his hand back, catching
Alice full in the face with the back of his hand with the weight of the gun
behind it. Her head snapped back, a small cut over her eyebrow. Ella began to
sob. �Do it!� ordered Clegg.

&nbsp;

Ella complied, still sobbing and begging us
to let them all go. Carol tried to ignore the bites, licks, teasing and kissing
that Freddie was forcing Ella to perform but in spite of herself
I saw her nipples stiffening. �There,� said Freddie smugly, �Aunty Carol is
enjoying that.� She shook her head and looked down at the floor in shame. Freddie
just laughed. �Only problem is, poor little Beth is feeling left out and we
can�t have that can we.� Beth shook her head vigorously. I guessed that she
wasn�t complaining about being left out at all. �Quite right young Beth,�
laughed Freddie. �Why don�t you give Aunty Carol a nice kiss.�
He got up from the couch and grabbed Beth by the arm pulling her across the
room. Taking her gag off, he pushed her to her knees alongside her sister and
forced her head between her aunt�s thighs, up under her skirt. �Now,� said
Freddie, �I�m sure you�ll have done this with your sister or one of the other
girls you know.� Beth shook her head vigorously to Freddie�s laughter. �Aunty Carol
is really going to like being kissed down there, so get started.� He draped Carol�s
skirt back over Beth�s head. �And get started,� he snarled, grabbing by her
bound wrists and pushing them up her back to force her forwards. �I want to see
some results.� 

&nbsp;

Ella had pulled away from Carol�s nipples.
�No one told you to stop,� Clegg barked, slapping her face and pushing her back
to work. The two girls, fearfully sobbing, set back to work. Carol, unable to
respond because of her terror, groaned through her gag. Clegg said,
�Excellent,� pulled off Alice�s gag and dragged
her from the couch. She tried to speak, coughing and sobbing as the gag came
free of her mouth. �Please stop,� she begged. �Let the girls go. I�ll do
anything you say, please.�

&nbsp;

Freddie grinned at her. �You�ll do anything
I say? I know that you stupid bitch! We�re not letting anyone go.� He pulled at
the front of her dress tearing it open. She begged him not to hurt them. He pushed
her down on all fours, pulled Beth�s panties down and pushed Alice�s
head up against her daughter�s arse. �Now help your daughter out, get your
tongue on her rim,� he said. �Show her how it�s done and she can do the same
thing for Alice. And just by way of
encouragement�� From behind, he pushed her skirt and slip up over her buttocks,
dragged down her panties and tights. Unzipping the fly of his trousers, took
her doggy style as her face was forced up between Beth�s buttocks. She groaned
in shame and fear and tried to pull her face from her daughter�s backside. She
was rewarded with a back-handed blow to her head that sent her falling back to
her task again.

&nbsp;

The five of them made a tableau of threat,
fear, lust, despair and abandon. As Clegg was pushing home against Alice�s buttocks, she in turn was tonguing her daughter.
Beth and Ella, terrified by the situation continued to torment Carol. All five
were grunting and groaning in misery, fear and humiliation. 

&nbsp;

The living room door opened. Into the debauched
scene walked Harry, pushing in front of him the bound, helpless and struggling
form of the dominatrix, wearing the same leather outfit that I had seen her
wearing in the dungeon with Tricia. �Well done Harry,� said Clegg pulling back
from Alice�s buttocks. Sinking back into one of
the arm chairs he grabbed Beth by the hair, forced her to her knees and pushed
her face into his crotch, demanding that she take his engorged cock deep into
her mouth. She was coughing and choking as he wrenched at her hair and thrust
forward with his hips to push his cock deeper into her throat.

&nbsp;

The dominatrix wriggled and bellowed with
fury. Tricia came into the room, holding an old blanket wrapped around herself. Purple rings of bruises on her ankles and wrists
testified to how she had been held captive. Apart from that, she looked OK.

&nbsp;

�Ah, you managed to get your girl back
too,� said Clegg. �Fine.� For the first time I
realised that Tricia had been seen as expendable in this, all Clegg was
concerned about was that his business wasn�t being messed around with. �Do take
off our guest�s hood, Harry,� said Clegg, nodding towards the dominatrix and
pushing Beth�s head back down as she tried to gulp for air.

&nbsp;

Harry grinned and unlaced the leather mask
that his captive was wearing. As he pulled it clear the identity of the
struggling, leather clad, dominatrix became clear.

&nbsp;

�Hello, Brian,� Clegg said. �How nice to see you. Your family are doing a much better
job of looking after my interests than you appear to have done. I�ve been having
such fun with your family. Such a delight to meet your wife; a shame we hadn�t
met before. And these daughters of yours too. Fancy
keeping them hidden away. And your sister in law too! My, my,
Brian, quite a little harem. Oh, I don�t suppose your wife realised that
you and Carol had a bit of a thing going, did she?� Brian growled. Alice gasped. Clegg gave a grunt as he came into Beth�s
throat. The girl started choking but Clegg made no attempt to withdraw,
instead, enjoying the pulsing sensation of the orgasm as his crotch pressed
against the girls face.

&nbsp;

�You bastard, Clegg!�� the
unmasked �dominatrix� exclaimed. �Let my family go.� The women tried to turn
around at the sound of Alice�s husband. Clegg slapped each of them in turn to
put them back to their tasks. Brian tried to start forward in defence of his
family but Harry simply grabbed the chain that linked his wrists and dragged
him back.

&nbsp;

�Now let�s see how much of this I�ve worked
out, shall we?� said Clegg getting to his feet, zipping his fly and knocking
Beth to the floor in the process. Clegg�s cum dribbled from her mouth as she
coughed and sobbed. The others were all left crying, cowering together in a
heap in the corner of the room. It was clear that none of them had the
slightest idea of the business that Brian had been involved in, much less his
recent misdemeanours. �You decided that our friend Larry here was making things
complicated for you, cutting down the need for auctions. Now I think you�ve
been taking a slice � enough to fund that little fun nest where your two lady
friends run that dungeon and where you�ve been keeping Tricia. I can�t prove it
but I think that�s what has been going on. So you want to discourage Larry and
you tried to have him snatched in Kushtia. Very silly that � there weren�t too
many people who knew he was going; you, Me, You, Harry, Rick and Sebastian. I
was reasonably sure it was someone inside the business and I didn�t like the
idea of that. I know Larry has been shaking up things for us but we haven�t
really upped the number of girls we are taking overall so I didn�t think that
any of our competitors would really be hurting. I couldn�t see that Harry, Rick
or Seb had any reason for doing this. But you, well,
the numbers from your side haven�t been getting any better have they Brian, old
man? And Larry�s work has really been helping us stay afloat.�

&nbsp;

Brian tried again to break free but without
success. �I�m not sure how you set up the girl at the Embassy. What was her
name? Cora. You can�t just have been lucky although Larry here certainly was.
Perhaps we�ll have a chat about that? Perhaps the Minister can have a chat at
his end? Maybe she was working for one of other firms; someone you were helping
out with special prices maybe? Not sure if you�ve that clever but that might
cause a few problems if we�ve now upset someone that thought they were going to
get a slice of the trade to Kushtia. Still, I�m sure we�ll get to the bottom of
that. Won�t we, old man?

&nbsp;

�Then of course you made a very big
mistake. I�m sure you realised I wouldn�t like being threatened,� Freddie held
up the envelope and the letter that I�d been given in the dungeon. �But perhaps
you thought it would annoy me enough to move Larry here on. The only thing is
Brian, old man, if you�re going to send threatening letters don�t use our
office stationery.� Freddie held the letter up to the light, The Clegg logo was
clearly visible as a watermark. �That really wasn�t clever. It just confirmed
what I thought. And I must say I didn�t like that idea at all. Then when I
found out about the Lisson Way property I thought
that would probably be where you were hiding our Tricia. Harry did the rest.�

&nbsp;

�Freddie�� Brian began.

&nbsp;

Clegg got to his feet, �Sorry, old man, I�m
not really interested.� As Brian tried to break free of Harry�s hold, Clegg reached
forward and jammed the envelope and paper into Brian�s mouth. He coughed and
choked in response. �I�m sure we�ll find someone to take you off our hands,�
said Freddie. �Larry, I know, will be keen to find a customer. It could be a
new line for us - male slaves. Perhaps that Daphne Challis you got on so well
with at the video screening might be interested. And you�ll be anxious to show
how willing you are to make amends by having your family help us out too. The
two girls should fetch a price and Alice and Carol seem to have their
uses.� Should help the numbers, old man,
should help the numbers.� Brian was still struggling to break free from Harry�s
hold but without success. Freddie smiled and went on, �Just so you know Brian,
old man, people who fuck with my little family find that their family gets
fucked with!�

&nbsp;

Clegg turned to the women. �Get this lot
into Prep, Harry,� he said. �I�ll be up at the Centre tomorrow and I want to
see them naked, collared and shaved. And you can let Rick�s team know they�re
all on the available list.� The women looked shocked and confused. Brian was at
once terrified and furious. �And that includes him,� Clegg pointed at Brian.
�Get someone from the team to go through here and get anything that looks like
theirs into the incinerators. Clothes, jewellery, everything, I�d hate them to
think there was anything of their past life they could go back to.� He went
across to where Alice was sprawled on the floor, her dress torn and cum
smeared, her two daughters and sister crowding close to her as if by doing so
they could avoid Clegg�s attentions. He reached up to Alice�s
neck and tore her string of pearls from her. �Start with this,� Clegg snarled
tossing them into the middle of the room. �And don�t forget this one�s wedding
ring. I�d hate her to have some reason to remember what got her into this.��� 

&nbsp;

�Well,� said Tricia, as Harry was about to
hustle Brian and the women out to the van, �If we�re taking him into stock, I
wonder if I might help out with some of the orientation sessions at the Prep
Centre. I think there�s a whole lot I can do to help get him ready for his new
life.� Her grin could only have increased his apprehension.

&nbsp;

It was a side of Tricia that I hadn�t seen
before but I understood how she felt and I was just glad she was back safe and
sound even if Freddie hadn�t been worried. And if I�d ever had any doubts about
Clegg�s ruthless determination to have things the way he wanted, they were
certainly gone now.

&nbsp;

Chapter 38 : All Bar None

&nbsp;

It didn�t take Tricia and I long to get our lives back on track. She didn�t seem to be
bothered by Clegg�s attitude. �It�s the game� she said. �At the end of the day it�s dog eat dog. You have to accept that. Loyalty is only
as good as the use you are. They came to get me because it suited them.� I was
surprised by her casual acceptance of the risks not only of something going
wrong but of being left to swing if it didn�t suit the organisation.

&nbsp;

In the end she decided to leave Brian�s
�orientation� to Rick�s team, Harry was keen to get her back on operations and
she wanted to forget about being snatched herself. She also wanted to show she
could take the lead role on a pick up, she was fed up with playing second
fiddle to some of the others on Harry�s team but she knew she�d have to up her
game after the business with Brian.

&nbsp;

I�d finished up for the day in the
Whitechapel office. Tricia and I had arranged to meet up in the bar where Harry
and I had had our drink before the Kushtian trip. I was there first. The bar
was almost empty. 

&nbsp;

I was sat there listening to my i-Pod. Rick had let me have a
down-load of Rachel�s distraction mantra. It made eerie listening.

&nbsp;

As Rick had said, she was counting off each
of the rapes in her own head; distracting herself from the conditioning tapes
by concentrating on the pain and humiliations she had suffered since her
abduction. �27,� I heard her voice say. �It�s the tall blonde guard with the
very short hair. He wants me to suck him off. He tells me he�ll beat me if I
don�t �do it nice�. I believe him. He�s big, muscular, tall.
No fat anywhere on him. No sign of any humanity either. He tells me to unzip
his fly. I�m too slow. He slaps my face. He�s wearing a ring; gold, a jaguar
head with rubies for eyes. The ring catches the side of my mouth. There�s a
sharp pain. It�s bleeding. He grabs my hair. I�m scared that he�ll break my
neck. I�m on my knees. I fumble with the zip of his fly. I can see the
stitching on the denim, the yellow metal of the zip tag. I�m still too slow,
another slap. My ears are ringing. I pull his cock from his trousers. He tells
me that�s good. It�s swollen, purple, he�s obviously
already excited. It smells musty, somehow, as if it�s come from some damp, dark
cave. He says to use my mouth; like I�ve done for the others. They�ve all told
him that I can do it all right but he might have to force me. I say he doesn�t
have to hurt me. He says maybe he�d like to anyway and laughs. I�m more scared
than before. I do as he says. My mouth is full of his cock. He pushes back against
me, I�m choking. It seems like his whole weight is behind his cock, threatening
to push it through my throat. He doesn�t take long. I feel him come, his cock
pulsing with a rhythmic judder. I taste his salty, slimy cum. He keeps my head
pressed against his groin. Not bad, he says. That�s what he thinks. For me,
it�s vile. I�m choking with the taste and the smell and the feel of his slime
in my mouth. He pushes me away, I fall back against the wall, my bound arms hit
the wall first and then the weight of my body crashes against them. I can feel
the skin on my elbows scraping away as I slide down the wall. The guard walks
towards me and crouches down. I think he�s going to help me up but he doesn�t.
He reaches down and pulls at my skirt, he uses it to
wipe off his cock. Not bad at all, he says. Perhaps, I�ll be back, he says. I
hope he isn�t. But I know there will just be more. I curl up on the floor,
trying to get inside myself. It�s only there I can get away from all of them.�

&nbsp;

I could hear the voice of the preparation
tape in the background. �Listen to me,� it said, in an insistent, flat
monotone, �Listen to me. You know what you must do to be happy. You know that
you only have to obey. Listen to me. Listen to me�.�

�

�28,� she went on, insistently. �It�s one
of the trainers. He�s short and thin with long dark hair. He wears a mask, a
white face; expressionless, no feeling. He�s holding the cane they use to beat
me. He spreads my thighs with the tip of the cane, looks at the cuts and the
bruises. He seems pleased but I can�t tell from the featureless mask that
covers his face. My cunt is naked, exposed, but he�s not
looking at that; he�s enjoying the bruising that they�ve done to my thighs.
It�s horrible how he�s staring at me, more interested in my pain than my sex.
He changes how I�m tied, straps my wrists up to the top of my arms, my ankles up
to the tops of my thighs. I can�t protect myself at all but then I never could.
He watches as I wriggle on the floor. At least I think he watches, I can only see his eyes flickering back and forth behind
the mask. His skin seems soft when he touches me but what he does to me is
hard. My limbs are bent and aching already. He is still watching me wriggle. I
don�t want to do this for his amusement, but it�s so uncomfortable. He tells me
I must learn to accept restraint. I spit at him. He�s not pleased. He gets a
wire frame and wedges it in my mouth. I try to shake my head. He moves a catch
at the side, the frame spreads my mouth wider. I can�t
stop it. He laughs behind the blank white mask as I groan. I shake my head in
protest. He shakes his head, more slowly. He�s got some sort of short wide
belt. It�s a collar as deep as my neck is long. He fastens it in place. It
holds my head rigid. He tells me I must learn acceptance. I don�t believe him.
I won�t believe him. He takes off his trousers, hangs them neatly over the back
of the chair. He�s going to rape me but he wants to make sure his trousers
don�t get creased. He takes me on the floor. He pushes his hand against my crotch.
I try to pull away and he laughs. He tears at my knickers, they are sodden with
my own fluid and the cum of those that have been
before. I feel him push his soft fingers into my cunt.
He pulls at the hair that is there. One more rape. No
different to the others apart from in the trivial, miniscule details of who and what and how. His cock seems no different to the
others. His hands no different. His breath carries the
sweet and pungent smell of garlic. I can smell tobacco on his clothes. His
white, rigid mask presses against my face. I smell its plastic artificiality.
Expressionless I can see nothing of his feeling from the mask while within me I
sense every rise and fall in his lust in the stiffening and ebbing of his cock.
He pulls away. He moves behind me. What�s he doing now? I can�t see what he�s up
to. I feel him pull at my hair, feel his cock against my head. He�s wound my
hair around his cock, he pulls back and presses
forward. I feel his cock against my scalp, the tug on my hair as he pulls back.
With a short spasm he comes, pinching at my tits with his soft fingers as he
does so. He leaves me on the floor; his cum dripping from my hair. My clothes more torn than ever. He says nothing; just looks
at me through his expressionless mask and leaves.�

&nbsp;

�29,� she continued. �The last one�s only
just gone. It�s the receptionist. She can�t be any older than me. Why is she
doing this? Why is she doing this to me? She�s got mousey hair with blonde
highlights. What�s she wearing. I can�t remember. Oh
yes, just a t-shirt and a skirt. She�s saying why should the
boys have all the fun. She�s had a boring morning, what can I do to
amuse her? I can�t say anything, the gag has my mouth
spread wide. My tongue is dry as much from fear as anything. A cough and groan.
She laughs and says that�s a start. She�s got something in her hands. What is
it? A dildo and a harness. And tit clamps. I don�t
need to guess what she�ll do with them. She pushes me down on my back. The last
one strapped my wrists to the tops of my arms. She slaps at my tits. To perk
them up she says. I cry through the gag. They still hurt from the last one and
now she�s doing this. She fits the clamps to me, they
cut in with a sharp pain. I gasp. She smiles. I know it will be worse when they
come off. She�s taking off her skirt. Plain white panties.
So normal. So ordinary. She
squats across me, tracing a finger nail around my lips, spread wide by the gag.
My clothes are in tatters. She says how bruised my body looks. I keep thinking
of something else. Taking myself somewhere else. Not
there. Not in that room any more. Far away. She pulls
on the chain linking the nipple clamps. The sharp pain brings me back. She
smiles again at my groans. She gets up and straps on the dildo. There, she
says, this will be better than all those boys you�ve had to put up with. I try
to beg her not to. Even with the gag she knows what I�m saying. She laughs and
tells me that she�ll do just as she likes, that I�m here to be used, that I�m
fuck meat. I don�t believe her. I go on not believing her. She sees me shake my
head. It makes her angry. She grabs me by the hair and hits my head back
against the floor. You�ll be fucked until you give in, she tells me, pushing
the dildo into my cunt. It�s hard and rigid, and
cold. She tells me I am going to cum. I shake my head again, she can�t make me.
She carries on thrusting the dildo into me. Again and again.
I loose count of the number of times. I�m no longer there. My body is there,
but I am elsewhere. My body is being fucked but I am not. She bangs my head
against the floor again. I am back in the room with the pain and the shame. She
can tell and pushes harder. I give a whimpering cry. She gives a guttural snarl
and a grunt. I can tell she has finished. She climbs off and gets to her feet.
She un-straps the dildo and puts on her skirt. She turns to go and then turns
again. She kicks me. The toe of her shoe hits against my side. Pink leather,
pointed toe, four inch heel, strap around her ankle.� I look down as the heel slides across my naked
belly leaving a red scrape behind it. I try to curl up into a ball as she
leaves me. The clamps are still on my tits. I focus on the pain.���� 

&nbsp;

I knew what happened after that. It was, as
they say in the cinema, where I came in. I wasn�t sure whether or not I wanted
to listen to more but then Tricia arrived. I took the earphones off, relieved
to have an excuse to stop listening.

&nbsp;

I went over to the bar to get Tricia and me
a couple of drinks. I felt I needed one, she was being sociable. The girl that Harry
had been hitting on when we were last there was still behind the bar. I took
that to be an encouraging sign. I hadn�t thought that he�d have her snatched
but you can never be sure with Harry. 

&nbsp;

�Hey,� she said. �Nice to
see you again. Haven�t seen your friend for a while,
either.�

&nbsp;

�I�ve been out of the country,� I said,
honestly. �Haven�t seen too much of him myself.�

&nbsp;

�Well, if you do, tell him I asked after
him.�

&nbsp;

I picked up the drinks and took them back
to our table. Tricia had noticed my conversation. �Another of your conquests?�
she smiled, almost suspiciously, picking up her drink.

&nbsp;

�No,� I said. �Harry�s�

&nbsp;

Tricia smiled. �I didn�t think he did
anything apart from work.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, it looks like that doesn�t it? I
encouraged him, I suppose. I thought he was seeing that girl but it sounds as
if things cooled off. I dunno. It all started before
I went to Kushtia and I�ve had other things on my mind since I got back.�

&nbsp;

�I know. Thanks for helping get things
sorted out.�

&nbsp;

�Well, I didn�t do too much. It was all
down to Freddie and Harry really. And if it wasn�t for me you wouldn�t have
been snatched in the first place.� 

&nbsp;

�It could have been worse, I suppose,�
Tricia said, looking around the bar to see that we couldn�t be overheard. �They
didn�t treat me too badly apart from when they brought you over to impress you.
The snatch was the worst bit. I was pretty scared, I�ll admit. I had no idea
who they were and they weren�t too gentle tying me up. Actually thinking about
it, it was kind of interesting � I�m going to suggest to Harry that he includes
being on the receiving end as part of the training programme. They were arguing
about whether to take me with them or whether to wait for you. I got worried
that I was very much expendable. It was all a bit of a shambles really. Then,
when they got me to that dungeon, Brian tried to perv
his way around me a couple of times in that dominatrix outfit but the girls -
the ones that picked you up - saw him off � I don�t think they were too keen on
him either. What happened about them anyway?�

&nbsp;

�They weren�t around when Brian was
collected but, since you ask, I think Harry�s running a check on them as
possible recruits. Oh, here he is.�

&nbsp;

Rachel waved to Harry as he stood at the
door of the bar looking around. He waved back, pointed to a bottle on the bar,
asking if we wanted another. We nodded. He got chatting to the girl behind the
bar. It didn�t look like we were going to get our drinks for a while.

&nbsp;

Tricia pointed to the iPod.
�Is that what I think it is?�

&nbsp;

�Yeah,� I said, �not real pleasant
listening. It makes me wonder if I should be doing this. I mean it started off
like a bit of a game. Just a different product. But somehow, this, well.�

&nbsp;

�I know,� Tricia said. �It�s hard I guess.
I try not to think too much about the girls. To Harry they�re just so many
kilos of live-weight, so many dollars traded, but I can�t get that abstracted.
The problem is the whole thing is such a kick. There�s nothing like the buzz of
a snatch. I guess I�m addicted.� She pointed to Harry at the bar. �Is he
planning to lift her?�

&nbsp;

I shook my head. �Don�t think so,� I said.
�They seemed to be having something approaching a normal relationship when I
last looked.�

&nbsp;

Tricia looked puzzled and took a pull of
her beer.

&nbsp;

I changed the subject back to Rachel. I
waved the i-Pod. �Have you
heard if Rick has made any progress with this young lady?�

&nbsp;

�Uh huh. Seems like they�ve found some psychotropic drugs
that have been able to suppress her ability to distract herself. Look
like the conditioning is working properly this time. They aren�t sure if she�ll
be able to write but I�m sure Harry can find you another one if you need.� �

&nbsp;

I shrugged my shoulders. I wasn�t sure if
it mattered now. We seemed to be getting on OK without her skills. Eventually,
Harry came over.

&nbsp;

�She was asking after you,� I said nodding
to the bar.

&nbsp;

�Yeah, it�s been a bit difficult but we�re
going for a meal later. Life might be a bit quieter now.�

&nbsp;

�I thought that was what Sarah was supposed
to be helping out with � getting the admin off your back.�

&nbsp;

�Well she does, sure, but she�s a bit of a
distraction too. And she�s been getting a bit over her position lately. Still,
I wouldn�t want to lose her.�

&nbsp;

�It�s not like she can resign,� Tricia
chipped in.

&nbsp;

�No, but Freddie�s bound to suggest selling
her again and � �

&nbsp;

I interrupted him. �Stop being so bloody
miserable Harry. Just let Sarah get on with the admin. If she�s getting out of
line give her to the guards to play with for a while. That�ll solve things. And
you take some time out for fun. You�ll be busy enough soon with the work we�re
going to get as a result of the Kushtian trade license.�

&nbsp;

�I�d forgotten about that with all the
problems sorting Brian out but yes, you�re right. Do we know what it will
involve yet?�

&nbsp;

�No, not really. It�s only a sort of framework contract as it is. It gives us
exclusivity to supply from the UK
and establishes the opportunity to quote for any Kushtian import requirements.
So it�s not like they�re going to suddenly order a batch of product. We�ll
probably have to put some effort into developing the business I guess. I need
to talk to Freddie about that.�

&nbsp;

�So no more orders like Hannani�s
or the Kalinin�s
at the moment?�

�� 

�Not yet, although Freddie mentioned he�s
got a meeting with some UK
based Kushtian, the Emir of somewhere or other. I wouldn�t be surprised if
something comes out of that. He�s going to tell him about what we�ve done for
the Kalinin, the Counsellors and Hannani.�

&nbsp;

Chapter 39 : Training Plan

&nbsp;

With Brian and his family packed off to
orientation, things started to get back to normal 

in the office. Business was certainly getting back on track. There
seemed to be plenty going on.

&nbsp;

After the worries over Tricia it was a
relief to get back to some real work. I had the project for Steve Glennis to deal. I was happy with the way the account
management activities were working out generally but I needed to do some more
thinking about that. Sebastian had finished the first version of the web site
and circulating the video to our clients seemed to have worked in driving folk
to look at the new services. We were already seeing some benefits from that.
Tricia told me that the research teams were rushed off their feet doing quotes
for the Search &amp; Snatch service and she had four pick-ups scheduled the
following week. I should have been pleased at the increased activity, I know,
but it meant Tricia and I weren�t getting much time together and after recent
events I was seeing that as a bad thing.

&nbsp;

Harry had the idea that I ought to get some
more field experience. �I get worried,� he said, �when anyone that hasn�t had
the experience starts tinkering around in field ops. I mean the thing in
Kushtia sounded like it went OK and you�ve sat in on a number of pick ups now
but it�s not the same as doing the job yourself. I think you ought to do some
more familiarisation.�

&nbsp;

�How do you mean,� I said. The ops side was
interesting and anything that Harry had planned was likely to be more fun than
working up market plans.

&nbsp;

�Well, do you remember the practice run we
set up when you met Tricia first of all?�

&nbsp;

I did. The burglary had been one hell of an
adrenaline rush. I nodded.

&nbsp;

�OK,� said Harry. �We�ve got another site
that you can practice on.�

&nbsp;

Harry�s team set up a briefing session. The
idea was that I�d raid a small office on the edge of town. There would be one
girl there according to surveillance. I just had to secure her and rob the
place. They�d scoped it out. They reckoned I�d be safe to do it solo. I wasn�t
so confident, but Harry insisted I�d be all right. 

&nbsp;

I pulled on a pair of latex gloves and a
ski mask. Once I got inside, it was pretty obvious that there was no one else
around apart from the girl behind the desk, just as the briefing had said. She
looked up as I walked towards her. She put her hands up to her face as she saw
me, obviously startled. Dark hair, early twenties I guessed; efficient looking
in a neat, white, short sleeved, blouse. I didn�t want to scare her too badly,
even if it was only so she didn�t make too much noise. I slid my jacket back
and pulled the pistol from the waistband of my trousers. �Please don�t cry
out,� I said, quietly. �And keep your hands where I can see them. I don�t want
to hurt you.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, wow,� she said, apparently unfazed,
�are you robbing the place?�

&nbsp;

I was surprised by her reaction. �Err,
well, yes, I mean, look aren�t you supposed to be frightened by this?� I waved
the gun at her.

&nbsp;

She grinned back. �Don�t be silly. I know
about guns. I can see you�ve still got the safety on.�

&nbsp;

�Shit!� I said, nonplussed. I looked down
briefly at the gun but jerked my head up again, half expecting her to try to
jump me across the desk. I looked back at her. She was grinning.

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry. I�m not bothered. You can
take what you want from here. I�m pissed off with the place anyway. It�s just
so dull. The boss is a fart. You�ve brightened the place up.�

&nbsp;

�I don�t suppose you know where the safe
is?�

&nbsp;

�Of course! It�s through there in the old man�s office.� She pointed to a door
behind her. �Here, I�ll show you.� She got to her feet. �Ooh, I guess I ought
to do this properly,� she said raising her hands above her head in a gesture of
surrender as she walked across to the door to another office. I watched her
rear. With her tight black skirt and her high heels tapping on the wooden office
floor, I was enjoying the view. �Come on, follow me,� she said looking back
towards me over her shoulder. �It�s this way.�

&nbsp;

�Look, don�t think I�m not grateful and
everything but this isn�t really how you�re supposed to be is it?�

&nbsp;

�Oh, come on! You�re not some mindless
thug. Actually you�re kind of cute and I quite like forceful men.� She led the
way into the other office. �The safe�s down there,� she said, pointing behind
the desk. She stood with her back to the wall, hands still raised. �The key�s
in the drawer of the desk.� She smiled at my evident confusion, but her next
remark did nothing to make it any easier. �But you�ll probably want to tie me
up first, won�t you?�

&nbsp;

I almost dropped my gun.

&nbsp;

�I mean, so you can go through the safe. I
don�t think there�s much in there but, you�ll want to have a good look and you
can�t really rely on me standing here like this can you? Anyway, I�ll get tired
with my hands up like this.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, all right,� I said. She smiled. �I
don�t suppose you�ve got any rope have you?�

&nbsp;

She shook her head. �Don�t be silly,� she
said. �You can�t expect me to do all the work.�

&nbsp;

I looked around. The office windows had a venetian blind, a long cord hung to one side. I decided it
would be good enough. I yanked it free of the blind. She looked approving.
�That�ll do,� she said. �How do you want me?� she asked flirtatiously, raising
an eyebrow.

&nbsp;

I was convinced that I would be safer with
her tied up, though not for the usual reasons. �Turn around, get your hands
behind your back,� I ordered, waving the gun at her. 

&nbsp;

She giggled but she did as she was told.
�That�s better. This is more fun.� she said as I closed in behind her, pushing
the barrel of the gun against the nape of her neck. �And that�s quite sexy.� I
ignored her, focussing on using my other hand to loop the cord around her
wrists. With a couple of turns of the cord in place I felt able to put my gun
down so I could tighten the cords and knot them off. I let her go and she
turned around. �Pretty good,� she said as she flexed her arms experimentally
but without seeming to loosen the cords.

&nbsp;

�Are you an expert, then?� I asked. 

&nbsp;

�My boyfriend�s tried a few times,� she
laughed, �but he�s not as good at it as you.�

&nbsp;

�I�ll take that as a compliment. Now take a
seat while I have a look in the safe.� I took her by the arm and led her to the
big, leather, padded, chair that stood behind the desk. I found the key and
went to open the lock. Nothing happened.

&nbsp;

�You�ll need the combination,� she said,
quietly. �I could tell you. If you made me.�

&nbsp;

I was beginning to get the measure of my
captive. I picked up the pistol and walked towards her. �I imagine threats
aren�t going to be enough,� I said, pressing the gun up under her tits. She
shook her head smiling. �But perhaps,� I ran the barrel of the gun across one
of her nipples; it was already stiffening, �if I were to pinch, here,� I reached
forward and gripped the nipple through her blouse. She gave a gasp but didn�t
try to pull away. I pinched again. She responded with an appreciative grunt and
pushed her hips forward. I slid my hand up under her skirt. A pleasant
surprise; she was wearing hold ups, not tights. She didn�t try to pull away. My
fingers were twisting at the hairs spilling around the edge of her already damp
panties.

&nbsp;

�Oh,� she gasped. �That�s � uhh � not fair, Mr Burglar. Oooh.� More pinching of her
nipples and her labia seemed to have the desired effect. �No,oooo,� she sounded unconvincing, �uhhuh, 7 left.�

&nbsp;

�Good,� I said, pinching and stroking some
more. �Go on.�

&nbsp;

�Ahh, uhh,� her hips were pushing her crotch against my hand, �Gnngh, ooooh, 24 right. Don�t
stop.� Her pants were now soaked. I switched from pinching to stroking the
inside of her thigh. �NNgh, oh, you bastard, you
absolute fucking bastard, you complete marvellous bastard.� She bucked again.
�17 left. That�s it. Ahhh.�

&nbsp;

I pulled my hand away, left her and headed
back to the safe.

&nbsp;

�You can�t stop. Come back.� She seemed to
shrink back into the chair, squeezing her thighs together, panting slightly. I
dialled in the numbers and span the wheel. I pulled the safe door open. She was
right there wasn�t much in there, just a few hundred pounds and a lot of dull
looking papers. Still, that wasn�t really the point, whereas the slim, dark
haired, girl in the chair rather was. ��������

�

�Not much there for my trouble,� I said. 

&nbsp;

She was looking up at me from her chair.
�How about here?� she said.

&nbsp;

�It�s been fun,� I said, �but I have to go.�
She looked disappointed. �I�ll make you as uncomfortable as I can before I go,�
I grinned. 

&nbsp;

She seemed to perk up. �Are you going to
tie me to the chair?�

&nbsp;

I shook my head. �Nuh uh. You�re going to struggle and if I leave you
on there you�ll pull it over. You�d hurt yourself. Got to
remember the Health and Safety regulations. Get down on the floor.�� She shuffled herself off of the chair and got
down on her knees.� I looked around for
some more cord. There was a laptop computer on the desk, the cable from its
power adaptor looked like it would do for her ankles. She smiled as she caught
me looking up her skirt as I bound her ankles. �Nice legs,� I said.

&nbsp;

�Thank you, sir,� she responded, wriggling
a little, testing the tightness of my knots but giving me a better look at her
legs at the same time. �But you know I�ll get out of this quite easily, as it
is.� I could see as she wriggled that she�d be able to get at the cords on
ankles with her hands.

&nbsp;

�I�m sure I can fix that,� I said. �It
would never do for you to get free too soon.� I found some more cable and ran a
loop around her waist, fixing her wrists to that. Another length around her
legs just above and below her knees made it harder for her to move around.

&nbsp;

�Hmm,� she said, trying again, �more
convincing.�

&nbsp;

�I try to oblige,� I said but I hadn�t
finished. A final length around her arms just above the elbows and around her
chest just below her tits, locked her arms against her body. 

&nbsp;

She gasped as I jerked the cable tight. �Ooh,
that�s tight,� she said but I didn�t think she was complaining. 

&nbsp;

I knelt beside her on the floor. �Better than the boyfriend?� 

&nbsp;

She nodded. �Mmm. Do you really have to go?� She wriggled her shoulders, the cords had pulled her blouse tight across her
tits. It made for a pleasant view. 

&nbsp;

I nodded reluctantly. �Sorry,� I said.

&nbsp;

�Oh well, you�d better gag me then.�

&nbsp;

I grinned. �Aren�t you going to offer to
keep quiet?�

&nbsp;

�What and miss out on the fun of wriggling
and groaning after you�ve gone? Don�t be a spoil sport.�

&nbsp;

I thought that the gag was going to be a
problem until I noticed that her boss had left a suit hanging on the back of his
office door. I searched the pockets and came up with a handkerchief and a
necktie. �These will do. I�m sure your boss won�t mind.� She coughed as I
pushed the handkerchief between her lips and grunted a bit as I pulled the tie
tightly across her mouth, cramming the cloth in. �How�s that?� I said, reaching
down and pinching one of her tits. She gave a muffled squeal. She shook her
head but her eyes were bright with excitement. There was a roll of packing tape
on the desk. I used some of that as well. She wasn�t completely happy with that
as it got caught in her hair but it meant the gag would take longer for her to
dislodge. 

&nbsp;

I took another look at my captive. �Now
since you�ve already warned me that you�re expecting to get loose.� She shook
her head but I ignored her and jerked her ankles up towards her wrists. I
knotted the cables together so that her wrists and ankles were touching. I got
some more cable and pulled her elbows together with it. She groaned into the
gag as I rolled her onto her side. �And let�s make sure your boss gets a treat
when he finds you.�

&nbsp;

She started to shake her head but I didn�t
let that stop me and with the gag she wasn�t making much sense. I guess she
didn�t fancy her boss and wasn�t looking forward to him finding her. I unzipped
her skirt and pulled it down until it was around her knees. I did the same for
her pants. Then I went to work on her blouse, pulling at it until the buttons
tore loose and she was left exposed. For the first time she was looking as
though she wasn�t completely enjoying it. She had a chain around her neck. It
carried a name in gold letters. �Kelly,� it said. Well it was nice to know. I
waved her good bye, pocketed the money and left her.

&nbsp;

I got back to the car where Harry was
waiting. �What took you so long?� he asked. �I was getting worried. Did she put
up a fight?�

&nbsp;

�No, not really, quite
the reverse. It was quite good fun but it wasn�t
much use as practice,� I said tossing the meagre take into his lap. �Here, I�ve
got enough to buy us a couple of drinks. I�ll tell you about it.�� ��

Chapter 40 : Market Research

Harry had a good laugh about my encounter
with Kelly. I�d been a bit suspicious that it was a put up job but he assured
me it wasn�t. She was just one of the possibles that
they�d had on a target list a while back. When they decided she didn�t fit the
customer profile they left her office on the list for possible training
exercises. He seemed convincing enough about it. I didn�t mind either way, it
had been fun.

&nbsp;

I bumped into Freddie outside of his
office. �Well,� he said, �at least the numbers seem to be picking up.�

&nbsp;

I had to agree with him. �Yes,� I said,
�the Search and Snatch service has been getting a lot of response and some of
that is already feeding through into billings, the on-line auctions have been
good for moving some of the stock too.�

&nbsp;

�You�re right,� said Freddie, �I can�t
remember when we�ve had so little prepped stock sitting around. That�s helped
keep the costs down in stock holding too. Mind you some of the staff up there are getting a bit restless; not enough girls for them to
play with.�

&nbsp;

�We need to find a way to fix that,� I
said, �the last thing we want to do is to hack the guards off, they do a great
job.�

&nbsp;

�Well give it some thought, can you.
They�ve got a bit of diversion with Brian�s family but they�ll be sold soon
enough and I don�t want to stack up any problems for the future.� He stopped
and thought for a moment. �Oh, and another thing� how do you think our market
share is now?�

&nbsp;

I stopped dead in my tracks. With all the
other activities, I�d forgotten one of the basics. I hadn�t really thought
about what share of the market we were getting and how we were shaping up
against the competition. With Freddie, though, I knew there wasn�t any value in
trying to bluff my way out of things. �Freddie, I haven�t the faintest idea.
I�d not really thought much about it with all the other stuff we�ve been doing
on analysing the client needs and setting up the new products and the account
management. You�re absolutely right though. We might be growing but if
competitors are growing faster we could be going backwards.�

&nbsp;

Freddie grinned. �Don�t worry,� he said, �I
thought that might be the case. You�ve been focussing on urgent stuff plus the
whole Brian thing was a bit of a distraction. I even have friends that are
saying if you carry on like you are the UK
will run out of women.� I laughed. Freddie went on. �We need to try to get some
sort of a picture though, don�t you agree?�

&nbsp;

I nodded.

&nbsp;

�I don�t think you�ll find it easy. It�s
not like anyone publishes the auction prices and volumes! Anyway see what you
can do. I was just going down to see how Rick is getting on with Brian�s
family. Do you want a look?�

&nbsp;

The real answer was �no, not really,� but I
thought that probably wasn�t wise. Freddie still harboured a grudge over the
whole Brian business and he�d been getting Rick to make things pretty tough on
the women. Plus, of course, he�d been making sure that Brian got to know what
was happening to them on his account. Freddie strode off towards the
preparation and orientation areas. I tagged along behind him. Rick was there to
greet Freddie when he got to the cells.

&nbsp;

�You�re looking to see how Alice and her
family are getting on?� Rick said.

&nbsp;

�Mmm,� said
Freddie. �I�d just like to satisfy myself that the regime we are holding them
under is sufficiently, let�s say, rigorous.�

&nbsp;

�Rigorous,� said Rick,
�is the watch word. Come and see.� He opened the door to one of the cells. I
followed Rick and Freddie inside.

&nbsp;

The four women barely reacted to our
arrival in the cell. Clegg had insisted that they should be all kept together
so that they should each witness the humiliation and subjugation of the others.
That included Brian who was standing chained to the far wall, naked, with his
wrists shackled over his head. He was looking in a pretty sorry state. Rick
explained that some of the girls had volunteered to, as they said, soften him
up. Tricia had quite a few friends in Prep and they had all welcomed the opportunity
to take their revenge on her kidnapper.�
There was a shelf on the wall beside Brian, Ranged along it was an
impressive array of butt plugs, nipple clamps, gags, paddles, whips and other
items of dubious but almost certainly unpleasant purpose. From the blood that
encrusted the wheals on his legs, it looked like quite a lot of the shelf�s
devices had already been employed on him. He tried to turn his head towards
Clegg. I could see that he�d been fitted with a dental gag. He managed a sound
from his throat at once angry and despairing. It wasn�t helped by the collar
he�d been fitted with. The stores had only had them in women�s sizes; the
biggest they could find still looked like it was choking him. Clegg ignored him
and turned his attention to the women.

&nbsp;

�I see they�ve been shaved,� said Clegg,
looking down at the four bald and women. �That�s good. Keep them like this,
don�t let the stubble grow back,� he said bending down beside Beth and running
his hand across her shaved pubis. �This one�s smooth enough, good.� He put his
hand beneath her chin to lift her head so he could look at her face. Her eyes
were red with tears. �Oh, yes. Take their eyebrows off as well and their
eyelashes. I want all their hair off and kept off.� He turned his attentions
towards Ella, pushing her down so she was laying face down on the floor of the
cell. He kicked her legs apart and then crouched peering closely at her
backside. The bruising around her arse showed she was being used from behind as
much as in front. �How often is the 18 year old one being fucked?�

&nbsp;

Rick picked up the clipboard used to record
punishments and rapes of the cell�s occupants from the hook beside the
door.� �This one?� he said, pointing at
Beth. �Three times so far today, seven yesterday. The
19 year old was eight times yesterday, twice so far today. The girls are more
popular than their mother or their aunt. They were done three times each
yesterday. �

&nbsp;

�Hmm,� said Clegg. He got up and gripped Alice by the throat, pulling her to her feet and thrusting
her back against the wall. She was choking from the pressure of his hand on her
windpipe. �Can�t have you feeling left out, can we? I know you just love
watching your daughters being raped but we�ll have to see you get your fair
share. Rick, make sure she and her sister are getting fucked just as frequently
as the girls. It�s not like your lot to need encouragement. Get the guards to
roll dice for which one they get to do if they can�t be relied on to share it
out evenly. Otherwise pretty good, pretty good. Keep
them going on this regime until they�re ready for training.� He turned to me.
�Have we had any offers or interest yet?� 

&nbsp;

�Well, Challis might be interested in him,�
I nodded towards Brian. �She�s asked for some photos and an estimate on initial
training costs. It looks like we�ve got some Kushtian interest in the two girls
but nothing on the mother or her sister yet. I think the sales team are a bit
disoriented by all this. They thought a lot of Brian. I�m not sure they are
putting all their efforts in.�

&nbsp;

�Well, see what you can do,� said Clegg.
�And tell the sales lot, they�ve got a new incentive plan. If they can�t find
customers for these they�ll be joining them on the web site.�� He stalked out.

&nbsp;

I went back to my office to work on the
market research challenge. I tried to map out a strategy for the problem. I
reckoned there were two main things we needed to know. How and what our
competitors were doing and what the total volume of sales, in the UK and
globally, were. I had a word with Seb, he reckoned he could give me a fix on the volumes and
values going through the internet auction sites with just a bit of hacking. I
said fine, as long as he didn�t leave our sticky paw prints over anyone else�s web
site.

&nbsp;

Freddie asked Ellie to give me a contact
that might be able to let me have a picture of the total number of abductions
in the UK.
I was puzzled as to how we might get that until she gave me the phone number to
call. Chief Superintendent Phyllis Jacobs of the National Crime Squad sounded
like she ought to be an authority and so she was. She pointed out that much of
what I needed to know was publicly available. The moves in Government to have
police forces publish their performance statistics meant that lists were
available of the number of missing person complaints and the clear up rates.
She pointed out that if I were to ask for a break down of numbers by sex and
age, she would be obliged to provide them under Freedom of Information
legislation and I might well get a good fix on what I needed. She was right; it
was quite interesting to see what a disproportionate number of women between
the ages of 18 and 35 had gone missing over the previous year, and how low the
clear-up rate for these disappearances was in comparison with that for other
groups.

&nbsp;

I didn�t ask Freddie why she was so willing
to help.

&nbsp;

I cut the police numbers down by a figure
that looked like the disappearance rate for other groups, that took care of the
�genuine� missing persons, I thought, and left the probable number of slave
abductions. Of course I still didn�t know how many of those on the police list
were as a result of operations like ours, some of them had to be amateur
collectors, picking up by individuals for their own use. They weren�t really
competitors individually but, of course, if they were snatching their own they
weren�t buying from us. It occurred to me that it might be useful for our
overall market share if the police were being more successful against the
amateurs, I�d have to think about that.

&nbsp;

Seb came up with some useful data. He�d come up with three web sites
run by UK
organisations. 

&nbsp;

That linked up with Freddie�s assessment
that there were five main competitors to us, Seb
reckoned that there were two others under development but not yet operational.
We had a look around. One surprise was to see two faces that I recognised.
Staring out at me from the screen were Rebecca, my some-time girlfriend whose
kidnapping had started my involvement with Clegg�s business, and Amanda, her
flatmate. Just out of curiosity I clicked on the �more details� button under
Rebecca�s photograph. �Offered for sale by private treaty,� it said. �Following
the decision of her owners to replace many of their current slave stock, this
well trained piece is available for immediate shipment to a delivery point of
your choosing. An experienced flight attendant, she has been serving until
recently on her current owner�s aircraft and would be an ideal purchase for any
owner seeking to improve service on board their own flights or with minimal
cross training on board an owner�s yacht.�

&nbsp;

I wondered for a while where she would end
up.

&nbsp;

Seb interrupted my thoughts, �Do you want to look at the numbers?� he
said.���� 

&nbsp;

He�d got figures for each of them. Together
they made up about 20% of the total number of girls lifted by my reckoning.
Given that there wasn�t much different about any of their web sites I guessed
that the share of overall sales would be pretty much the same as their share of
web based sales. It wasn�t accurate but at least it gave us a working
hypothesis. 

&nbsp;

As well as the numbers I felt I needed the
background data. At least I had Rachel�s report following her interviews with Sukie. I pulled the wad of pages from the file. It looked like
she had done a thorough enough job. Producing that had stopped anyone asking
about what else she had planned, I guessed. She�d organised it much as I had
expected with separate pages on each of the �keepers� that Sukie
had been loaned out to, 15 keepers detailed on one or two pages each and an
overall summary page. I started to read wondering if it was actually going to
help. It was interesting but anecdotal. I wasn�t sure how I was going to draw
any conclusions from it.

&nbsp;

There were some possibilities, though. The
interesting thing was the way in which so many ideas recurred. The sex of course and the violence and the beatings and the
institutionalised humiliation; as if it wasn�t sufficient for the slave to be
restrained at the bid of her keeper. It was almost as though the keepers
defined themselves in terms of their domain over the slaves that they kept. The
slaves weren�t simply utilitarian items, they brought status to their owners in
the same way that an expensive car or yacht might. Thinking about it, it
shouldn�t have been too much of a surprise.

&nbsp;

What was puzzling was that none of the
descriptions that Rachel had provided seemed to reflect the woman that I had
encountered on the island; her warmth, intelligence and instinct for
companionship. Whether that was a result of her perspective, or Rachel�s
interpretation or the influence of Sukie�s owner, I
couldn�t say but I did end up feeling that there I wasn�t getting the whole
picture

&nbsp;

Tricia was out of town on a job and I was
at a loose end anyway, so I thought I�d spend an evening with Sukie.

&nbsp;

I found her in a cell in the Prep Centre.
It didn�t look like anyone had taken much care of her. She was naked and
wearing some heavy shackles around her ankles. Her black, straight, hair was
hanging lankly, she didn�t look is if she had washed for days, she smelled that
way too. A steel yoke kept her wrists at shoulder level and the steel band
around her throat was closed with a padlock that also fastened her to a chain
to the cell wall. She was gagged as well. She turned towards me without any
show of resentment and knelt up presenting herself to me. �Hello, Sukie,� I said.

&nbsp;

She nodded in response. I unfastened her
gag, prising the ball from her mouth. �Thank you,� she said.

&nbsp;

�Why are you being kept like this?� I
asked. The yoke and shackles seemed much more severe than was usual and girls
were rarely kept gagged after they arrived unless there was some disciplinary
reason.

&nbsp;

�The guards tell me it�s because I have not
been �prepared�; not been �orientated�. Because you wanted my stories they have
just kept me secure, not done anything more. They worry that I will try to
escape, I suppose.�

&nbsp;

�Aren�t they right to?�

&nbsp;

�Perhaps,� she said enigmatically. �But
perhaps I have known this way for too long to want to be really free now.�

&nbsp;

�I want to talk to you,� I said.

&nbsp;

�I thought that�s what you were doing,� she
answered.

&nbsp;

�Not here. Somewhere more
comfortable.� She looked resigned. �It�s not like that,� I said. I
called a guard and had him remove the yoke. She still had her standard collar, I thought that would be enough. She seemed to take
that as a token of sincerity. �Come on, Sukie,� I
said. �Through here.�

&nbsp;

We went though to one of the semi-secure
suites that clients could use to evaluate stock. The
doors can be locked remotely and they have CCTV monitoring, but apart from that
they are pretty much like hotel rooms. Sukie looked
covetously at the bathroom. �Go on,� I said. �use it
if you want.�

&nbsp;

�A shower?� she asked.

&nbsp;

�Sure,� I said. �Take your time.� She gave a
smile of gratitude and disappeared into the bathroom. 

&nbsp;

She emerged about twenty minutes later, her
dark hair wrapped in a white towel turban. I tossed her a white towelling bathrobe, she grabbed it and pulled it on, instinctively
wrapping the robe about her. Suddenly she stopped and looked directly at me.
�Oh,� she said, �I�m so sorry, I forgot for a moment,
please forgive me.� She loosened the belt of the robe and let it fall open,
exposing her tits and her cleanly shaved sex. �Of course, I shouldn�t cover
myself without permission.�

&nbsp;

�It�s all right, Sukie,�
I said. �Fasten the robe. Come and sit here.� 

&nbsp;

She did so, gratefully. 

&nbsp;

�Your discussions with Sarah,� I said. 

&nbsp;

�She is very troubled,� Sukie
replied. �She finds it hard to accept her place. I have not seen her for a
while but I like it when we talk. She wrote down many things. About how I was treated. About the men and
the women.�

&nbsp;

�But not how you felt?�

&nbsp;

Sukie looked towards me and smiled. �No,� she said. �Not how I felt. She
did not ask. I did not tell her. I think she still found it difficult to
feel.� From her taking.
From her treatment. She is frightened to feel and she
cannot ask how others feel. I don�t think she is as much of a slave as you
might believe.�

&nbsp;

I looked silently at Sukie,
impressed by her perceptiveness. �Tell me how you felt.�

&nbsp;

�Felt?�

&nbsp;

�When you were taken. When you were raped. When
you were given to others. When you found yourself
here.�

&nbsp;

�I don�t know,� she said, pulling off her
towel turban and running her hands through her hair. �When I was taken? Shock,
I suppose. Shock that it could happen. Hope that I
would be rescued. Fear that I might be killed. And then the
fear that I would live. That was the shock, I think. How much you can
take and still live. How much pain. How
much horror. How much fear. And you go on
living. Then the denial; that it can�t be happening; that
there�s been a terrible mistake; that these people don�t really know who you
are.�

&nbsp;

�But nothing changes?�

&nbsp;

�No, nothing,� she relaxed a little and let
her robe fall loose. �Then you get angry. Angry with them; angry with whoever
they are doing it for; angry with the people where I�d been that they�d done
nothing to stop this. I smashed the chair in my cell. Smashed
it against the bed. It didn�t help.�

&nbsp;

�Did you find anything that did?� 

&nbsp;

She shook her head slowly. �You try to
negotiate. I�ll suck you off if you let me have more food. I�ll give you a hand
job if you find me some clothes. I�ll let you fuck me if you�ll just let me
remember what it was like to be me.�

&nbsp;

I looked on sympathetically.

&nbsp;

�It makes you sad. I sat for days without
moving. They came and did whatever they wanted. I did nothing to stop them.
There was no point in resisting, it didn�t matter.� She shrugged her shoulders.
�And then you know it won�t work. That you can�t change it.
That the bargains don�t work. That you�ll never be free.
And with every change you repeat the cycle. You�re raped � it didn�t happen, he
was a bastard, I could stop it happening again if only I did this or that, it
was all my fault, it was just my fate. You�re given to
another; the same thing all over again. When I found myself
here; the same.�

&nbsp;

I wasn�t sure how this was helping. I
offered her a drink. She seemed surprised. I gave her some wine. She smiled and
drank it gratefully. She looked at me suspiciously.

&nbsp;

�Are you going to rape me now?� she
said.� 

&nbsp;

�No,� I said. �We�ve finished for now. I�ll
try to get things made more comfortable for you.�

&nbsp;

She looked grateful. �Will I need to talk
to Rachel some more? She seemed very troubled.�

&nbsp;

�I don�t know. Not for a while,� I said. I
was thinking it was pretty unlikely that Rachel would be doing any more writing
given what I heard about the chemical cosh that Rick was using to suppress her
ability to distract herself. He�d kicked off some thinking about alternative
approaches to orientation but they wouldn�t be on stream in time. The guard
came to take Sukie back to her cell. I told him to
put her on a light regime. He grunted. I knew I�d have to check that things were
all right later. 

&nbsp;

Another guard appeared with Rachel moments
later. She must have passed Sukie in the corridor. I
wondered what Sukie would have made of the sight.

&nbsp;

The guard gave me her leash and handed me
the key to her gag. I asked about her wrist and ankle cuffs. He wasn�t carrying
the keys to those he said, standing orders said that her keys had to be held by
three separate guards. I wondered if they weren�t over reacting but I guessed
nobody wanted to find themselves on their back with her panties in their mouth
like Seb had; much less the conversation with Freddie
that would follow. They�d stopped raping her. The last thing they wanted was to
give her any more sources of distraction.

&nbsp;

I led her to the couch and told her to sit.
She did so without apparent reaction. She was naked but wore a metal head cage
that kept her mouth closed. They�d shaved her head, the black stubble of her
hair growing back showed as a dark shadow between the bands of the head cage. I
unlocked the chin piece to allow her to speak. She turned to look at me. 

&nbsp;

�Hello Rachel,� I said.

&nbsp;

She seemed only to half recognise me. Her
eyes looked as though she was having trouble focussing. I put that down to the
drugs. She didn�t say anything.

&nbsp;

�Are they letting you write?�
I asked.

&nbsp;

She looked at me again. It was obvious she
was having trouble finding the words. �Write?� she said. �Oh, words, on paper.�
She paused. �Write?� Another pause. �No,
not yet. Cannot write yet. Must
learn to please first. Must learn to obey first.
Then can be more free. If I obey I can be more free. Have to obey to be free.�

&nbsp;

I didn�t bother trying to debate the
intellectual inconsistency. There was a knock at the door. It was Rick. I waved
him in. Rachel got to her feet automatically, bowing her head as she did so. He
told her to sit.

&nbsp;

�What do you think?� he said.

&nbsp;

�I think she�s unlikely to be any further
use for my projects,� I said regretfully, �at least any time soon. She sounds
like she�s pretty well conditioned. Only problem is she�s probably too far out
of it to be any use to me.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, the EEG�s seem to show she�s not
faking.�

&nbsp;

�It sounds like her brain�s been fried.�

&nbsp;

Rick gave a grimace. �Well it�s not the
phrase we�d use. �Higher function disruption� is what we�d say.� Rachel was
sitting motionless and silent. �It�s not permanent. Well not all of it is
permanent.� Well, we think that most of
it isn�t permanent.�

&nbsp;

I shook my head. �It�s not going to work at
all. I can�t make use of what�s here, least ways not for writing.� Rick gave a
smirk. �Couldn�t we have found a less destructive approach?�

&nbsp;

Rick looked discouraged. �We did what we
could, Larry,� he said. �Maybe we need some new techniques. I�ll think about if
for the future. We are where we are with this one though.�

&nbsp;

I looked at where Rachel was sitting
passively, not reacting to anything we said. �She�s got quite a nice body,� I
said. �I�m sure we can find a buyer once she�s safe. I can�t see any reason to
keep her around, can you?�

&nbsp;

Rick shook his head. �Fair enough,� he
said. �I thought that was what you�d think. I�ll get some of the sales team to
trawl through their contacts and see if there�s a taker for a dark haired girl
with small tits and slim hips.�

&nbsp;

�That�s about all I could think of
too.�� It was a shame but I guess it
didn�t really matter. I locked her mouth strap back in place and watched as
Rick and the guard took her away. She didn�t resist. I went back to my office
and fired up the lap top. I had a market study to write up.

To:������������������ F.
Clegg���������������������������������� Dept.:

&nbsp;

From:�������������� L.

������������� Marketing

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Subject: ���������� Market
Share, Market Development &amp; Account Management



&nbsp;



&nbsp;

Freddie,

&nbsp;

You asked for a summary of our market share
position and I also wanted to update you on my thoughts following a review of
the material collected from acquisition number 06/349 (�Sukie�)
by our writer. I think it has a number of implications for the development of
our account management programme and the way in which we develop future markets.

&nbsp;

The market share data collected (see
attached) indicates that we have achieved a market share of 24% which confirms
us as one of the top three concerns in the market. Since the data indicates
that all three organisations have a market share of around 25% and this method
can�t give a result better than +/- 5% I can�t identify one specifically as
market leader. It could even be us! Obviously we need to continue to track this
and determine whether our increased volumes are coming at the expense of our
competitors (greater market share) or as a result of expansion in the market
(either as a result of our own efforts or of external factors). My current view
is that the increase results from market growth stimulate by the social and
economic factors we discussed before. Future analysis of competitor initiatives
should provide further evidence of this.

&nbsp;

I have summarised my conclusions and
recommendations below. A more detailed analysis follows. If you want to see the
original report prepared by #06/285 (�Rachel�), I can let you have a copy.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Summary
&amp; Recommendations

&nbsp;

The overall conclusions drawn from my
analysis of the #06/349 data are:

&nbsp;

(1)� There is a significant
growth in the numbers of women keeping slaves of all kinds and especially women
slaves (F-on-F). Some of this can be attributed to the growth in disposable
income amongst US females and to socio-cultural changes in that market. We can
expect an increasing number of F-on-F opportunities to present themselves
generally and specifically�
in the UK
and should gear our promotion and client recruitment programmes
accordingly.�� According to the
experiences of #06/349 F-on-F arrangements include principally domestic service
and sex-slave ownership scenarios. Alternative uses for property (as discussed
below) are less common in F-on-F arrangements. As a result it can be expected
that current preparation and orientation activities within Clegg Enterprises
will be sufficient for this new sector. F-on-F owners do collect their own
property but also rely on purchase at auction or commissioned collection as a
route to acquisition. F-on-F acquisition commissions are like to be based more
on personality than on physical attributes. This will require different
approaches to recruitment planning and a different approach to the management
of F-on-F accounts.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

(2)� The US is seeing an increasing use of
slaves for other purposes than the traditional sex slave / domestic servant
roles. This includes usage of slaves for such purposes as:

�

�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ponies : given Glennis�s enthusiasm for this it is
not surprising to find that #06/349 records this. It represents a small but
distinct market.

�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
D�cor: this is the second most
popular use for slaves. #06/349 records instances of slave usage as lamp
holders, furniture (especially tables and footstools), and as fixed display
pieces.� 

�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Toys &amp; Pets: #06/349
recounts eight instances of product acquired for a maze where they were kept
under observation for the amusement of the owners and a further six instances
of pet keeping where the product is used as a house-pet.

&nbsp;

(3)� US and
other nationality owners are increasingly
inter-acting and as a result territorial differences between markets can be
expected to reduce.

&nbsp;

I� propose the
following in response to this:-

&nbsp;

(A)�� ������� We should focus an account management activity to develop the
F-on-F sector.

&nbsp;

(B)�� ������� Our preparation / orientation activities need to review the
opportunities presented by the emerging new roles for slaves. This could
include development of new orientation programmes for toys and pets and the
development of approaches that will make it easier to deeply product for d�cor
purposes.

&nbsp;

(C)� �������� Account management activities should be organised to focus
on networks of owners rather than along geographical lines.� 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Regards

&nbsp;

Larry

I finished the memo and sent it off. I
wasn�t completely happy with it but it was a start.

&nbsp;

Sometimes market research is as important
for what it doesn�t tell you as what it does. I felt we needed to think outside
the box, or rather outside the packing case containing a tightly bound and tape
gagged girl, when it came to product and market.

&nbsp;

My encounter with Kelly had made me think
that we needed to look at things through different eyes. I felt I needed to see
her again.

&nbsp;

Chapter 41 : Kelly Girl

I
suppose I was cheating on Tricia but she was still off on some collection way
up country and wasn�t going to be back all week. I was bored and besides I was
very interested in trying to think about the market from a different
perspective. Least ways, that�s what I told myself.

&nbsp;

I
was sitting in the coffee bar across the road from the office that I�d
burglarised the week before. I don�t really know what I was planning to do.
Just see what happened, if anything, I guess. I watched as Kelly walked along
the street on the other side of the road. She didn�t look any the worse for our
encounter but then apart from the embarrassment of being found with her clothes
dishevelled, I didn�t think she�d had to put up with all that much.

&nbsp;

She
stopped on the steps of the building and looked at her watch. Deciding that she
had some time to spare, she skipped across the road towards me. She came into
the coffee bar and went up to the counter. �Slim latte,� she said, chirpily to
the guy behind the counter. �Thanks.�

&nbsp;

I
drew in my breath and decided to trust my judgement. �Hi, Kelly,� I called.
�Want to join me?�

&nbsp;

She
looked puzzled but came across to my table anyway. �Have we met?� she said.

&nbsp;

�Sure,�
I said. �I came by your office last week.�

&nbsp;

She
stared at me hard, right in the eyes. She put her coffee down and put her hands
to her mouth. �Oh. My God,� she said.

&nbsp;

�It�s
going to be a bit difficult talking if you put a full stop after every word.�

&nbsp;

�It�s
Mr Burglar, isn�t it?� she hissed quietly.

&nbsp;

It
was my turn to look puzzled. �I�m sorry?� I dissembled.

&nbsp;

�OK,�
she said, composing herself. �Silly of me. Nice to see you again. I really enjoyed our last date,
though I was upset when you ran out on me when you did. I didn�t expect to see you
again so soon. Or at all really.� She smiled, stirring
her coffee without really paying attention to it.

&nbsp;

�I
thought we might go somewhere.�

&nbsp;

She
put her head on one side, thinking. �I�m supposed to be at work.� She paused.
�But I�m not really feeling up to it. I had a disturbing experience there last
week. I�m having a flashback, right now.�

&nbsp;

�You
look fine.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah,
I know but I was thinking I�d call in sick. Tell the boss I was planning to
spend the day in bed.� She looked at me over her coffee, dark eyes staring out
through a fringe of dark hair.

&nbsp;

�I
could make sure you got home safely. If you liked.�

&nbsp;

She
looked me up and down. �Yeah,� she said, taking a deep breath and following it
with a big slug of coffee.� �That would
be good. You won�t mind if we take my car though?�

&nbsp;

�Fine
by me,� I said. �I came by bus. I hoped I might get picked up.�

&nbsp;

She
gave me a long hard look, picked up her coffee and said, �Let�s go.�

&nbsp;

I
followed her out of the coffee shop and down the road towards a multi-story car
park. We got into her VW Golf, she dropped some coins in the exit gate and we
were on our way.

&nbsp;

As
we drove she clipped her Bluetooth earpiece on and punched a number on her
mobile. �Mr Lewis? It�s Kelly. I was on my way in but I don�t feel like I can
work today. I�m going back home.� �..
Well thanks for being so understanding. �.. Sorry to let you down.� She turned
the mobile off and tossed the earpiece into the cubby hole between the seats.� 

&nbsp;

�Why
did you come back?�

&nbsp;

�I
enjoyed our last meeting,� I said. �And I was puzzled.�

&nbsp;

�Puzzled?�

&nbsp;

�By your reaction. That�s not the
effect I usually have on girls.�

&nbsp;

�Like
I said, I like forceful men.�

&nbsp;

�Don�t
you think this is a little dangerous?�

&nbsp;

�Yes,�
she grinned. 

&nbsp;

We
stopped outside a small semi detached house in a tree lined street. �Do you
know,� she said turning to me. �What would really scare me?�

&nbsp;

�Mice?� I suggested.

&nbsp;

She
shook her head. �If I was to be attacked in my own home.
Much worse than being burgled in the office.� She
smiled as she opened the door. �Come on in,� she said. 

&nbsp;

We
got through the door, she shut it behind us and instantly we fell on each
other. I pushed her back against the closed door, my mouth on hers, my hands
running over her body and hers over mine. I kissed her, she kissed back. We
paused for breath. �Not like that,� she said, thickly, �like this.� She turned
her back on me, grabbed my hand and pulled it up to her mouth. I got the idea
and pulled her hard back against me, crushing her mouth with my hand.

&nbsp;

�Shuttup bitch, if you don�t want to get hurt,� I snarled.
She pushed back, trying to pull her head away from my hand. She was struggling
like she meant it but not so I couldn�t keep hold of her. I grabbed her arms
and swung her against the wall. She was winded and slid to the floor. I ripped
the strap off of her handbag, rolled her over on her face and used it to tie
her wrists.

&nbsp;

�What,
what do you want?� she gasped.

&nbsp;

�Money,�
I said. �And maybe some fun.�

&nbsp;

�There�s
no money here.�

&nbsp;

�Than it�ll have to be the fun.� I
pulled her to her feet, dragging her up by an arm. She yelped as the belt took
her weight and cut into her wrists. �What�s through there?� I nodded to a door
off the hall.

&nbsp;

�Living
room,� she coughed; getting her breath back. I nodded to another door.
�Kitchen,� she said.�� 

&nbsp;

�That�ll
do,� I said pulling her down the hall and through the door. I pushed her down
on the floor beside the cooker. There was a knife block on the worktop beside
it. I picked out one with a 6 inch blade and held it to her throat. �You�re
going to be good.� It was an instruction, not a question.

&nbsp;

She
gave a quiet, �yes,� staring at the blade. She looked convinced. I found a tea
towel on a rail by the sink and used it to gag her, ripped the power cord from
her food blender and tied her ankles. �Stay there,� I told her and left to
explore the house.

&nbsp;

I
started in the living room. Nothing too interesting there.
A collection of R �n B CD�s scattered on the coffee table meant at least we�d
have some music to get down to later on. I looked back in on Kelly in the
kitchen as I went back down the hall. She gave me a �Hnngh� from behind her gag and wriggled her shoulders,
experimentally trying to loosen the bag strap around her wrists.� It looked like I�d made it a bit easy for her
so I went across and looped her ankle cord back to her wrists. I tipped her
onto her face. She grunted and gave another wriggle.

&nbsp;

I
thought I�d check upstairs. After all, she�d said she wanted to spend the day
in bed. Her bedroom was quite girly. No surprise there, I suppose; soft toys on
the window sill, patterned eiderdown on the bed.� I pulled out the top drawer of her dressing
table and tipped it out on the floor. Underwear; pants, bras,
thongs, tights, stockings. I chose one of her dark tan stockings and
pulled it over my head. That would do for a mask, I thought. Time
for some more play.

&nbsp;

I
got back to the kitchen. She�d put in some effort and managed to wriggle
herself most of the way across the floor towards the door. �Good try, darling,�
I said as I got to the door. 

&nbsp;

She
looked up, saw the mask and gave an appreciative grunt.

&nbsp;

�Like I said. It�ll have to be the
fun.� I ran the tip of the knife blade down her thigh. She squealed in what
sounded like genuine fright. The blade snagged on her tights; a run disappeared
up beneath the hem of her skirt. I took the knife, cut through the cable around
her ankles and pulled her to her feet. �Upstairs, cunt,�
I said, grabbing her arm and pushing her forward. She staggered up the stairs,
half falling as she reached the top. I pulled her into the bedroom and pushed
her down on her back on the bed. I lay down beside her, the knife close to her
throat. 



I
eased the gag out of her mouth, the knotted dish cloth hung around her neck.
She worked her jaw a bit, panting slightly. �You are good at this, aren�t you?�
she said.� 

&nbsp;

I
used the knife to slice the buttons from her blouse. She tried to shrink back
into the bed but the way her nipples had stiffened underneath her bra betrayed
her true feelings. �And you like this a lot too, don�t you?� I responded.

&nbsp;

She
whimpered as I ran the knife blade down her cheek. �Mmm,�
she muttered quietly. 

&nbsp;

I
thought it was all getting a bit too cosy. I reached out and grabbed a pair of
panties from the pile of underwear on the bedroom floor and crammed them into
her mouth. She bucked and struggled as I knotted the tea towel gag back in
place. I guess she felt she still had some more to say. I found a couple of
pairs of tights in the pile. I pulled her by the legs towards the end of the
bed. She squealed behind the gag as she fell backwards. Pushing the pants into
her mouth had improved its muffling effects. I grabbed each of her ankles in
turn and tied them to the legs of the bed so that her legs were well spread
out. She was trying to thrash about without much success. I pushed her square
in the chest so she fell back on the bed again. I climbed up alongside her and
put one arm across her throat. �I�d keep still if I were you. I think you�re
over dressed.� 

&nbsp;

I
slipped the knife under each of her bra straps, slicing through each in turn.
Another cut between her breasts let me pull her bra from her. I pulled her
tights down a cut through her panties on either side. If her nipples had shown
that she was starting to get excited, her soaked panties confirmed that her
excitement was rising. She moaned as she felt my hand on her snatch.

&nbsp;

I
sat up. She gave me a quizzical look and a puzzled and disappointed grunt. She
tried to wriggle her hips indicating that she wasn�t happy that I had stopped.
�Uh-uh,� I said wagging my head. �The burglar�s got work to do. I haven�t even
started looking for jewellery or cash yet.�

&nbsp;

Kelly
whimpered in response, plainly unhappy at being left, but I felt I ought to
play the part. I turned out the contents of her dressing table, tipped out her
handbag, went through a couple of jewel boxes that stood on the window sill
behind her bed, pulled some clothes out of her wardrobe, upended some drawers
on the floor. I made a bit of a mess but I guess she wouldn�t mind clearing up
afterwards. There wasn�t much there. If I�d been a real burglar, I�d have been
disappointed with everything but the girl. It was then that I stubbed my toe.

&nbsp;

It
was a suitcase under the bed. I went to pull it out. Kelly got distinctly agitated,
bouncing around on the bed without having any effect on her bonds. �What�s
this?� I said, earning a look of disapproval from Kelly on the bed. She shook
her head and squealed.

&nbsp;

I
sat down on the bed and put the case down beside me. I opened it. I guess I
wasn�t surprised by what it contained. Kelly was still looking furious but now
she was blushing as well, curious given that she�d let me tie her to the bed
and cut her clothes from her I thought.

&nbsp;

It
was her BDSM toy box. There were a couple of bondage magazines, a couple of
fetish scene magazines, and a collection of straps, gags, dildos, vibrators and
other stuff. 

&nbsp;

I
reached across and loosened off her gag. She pushed the panties from her mouth
with her tongue. �You are a bastard,� she said. �You weren�t supposed to find
that.�

&nbsp;

�Shame,�
I said. �You can�t rely on anyone. Do you want to tell me about this stuff?�

&nbsp;

She
shook her head. �I was happier with what we were doing before.�

&nbsp;

�You�re
in no position to negotiate.� I ran one of the vibrators along the inside of
her thigh. I thumbed the switch as it reached her crotch. She gave a squeal and
tried to snap her knees together. It jerked her ankles painfully against the
stockings that tied her. She yelped.

&nbsp;

�Bastard,�
she panted, arching her back to push herself against the vibrator. I picked up
one of the fetish mags and started to thumb through
it, ignoring her reaction to the vibrator pressed against her crotch. �What�s
to tell? You know what I�m in to.� I switched the vibrator off. She grunted and
tried to push her hips forward. �I go to the occasional club event. It�s the
only way I can get the buzz. My boy friend wasn�t keen. I think it scared him
off. There�s a few of us at the munch that have had
the same problem.� I flicked the vibrator back on. �Ahhh!�

� 

�Munch?�
I said.

&nbsp;

�It�s
a sort of casual meet-up at the local pub for folk interested in this stuff,�
she said. �I�ve got a few girlfriends I see there. They�re pretty much like me.
Wish they could get to do more of this; can�t find the blokes that will give
them what they want. There�s plenty of opportunities
for female tops. Subs like me find it harder.�

&nbsp;

�Let
me make it easier.� I jammed the vibrator into her cunt
and turned it on. It cut the conversation short as she moaned in reaction to
it. I left it in her while I rummaged through the box. I pulled out a ball gag.
It was bigger than the ones we used in the Prep Centre. She took it without
trouble. The vibrator was bringing her close to a climax. She was drooling
around the edge of the gag as she shook her head from side to side and twisted
her hips back and forth.

&nbsp;

It
made for a fun day�s play. At the end of it I was wondering if perhaps we
really needed to go on abducting girls to get the slaves we wanted. I left
Kelly to worry about clearing up. 

&nbsp;

Chapter 42 : Building Works

&nbsp;

Business was certainly getting back to
normal. When I next saw Freddie he had quite a chirpy air about him. I was
still worrying about Rachel, I couldn�t help admiring
the way in which she had held on, even if it now looked as though she been
irreparably damaged by it. The one encouraging thing was that Rick reckoned she
was showing signs that her catatonic state was easing. He hadn�t found any
potential buyers yet. I suggested that he held off for a bit until we had a
better picture of her prognosis. It didn�t sound like smart business to me to
be selling stock on unless you were certain what you were delivering.

&nbsp;

Clegg had asked me to join a meeting. I got
there before he did. Sarah was there looking as efficient as ever, sitting
beside Clegg�s desk, demurely dressed in a white blouse and a long black skirt
that reached almost to the floor. I�d have asked her what the meeting was about
but her mouth was filled with one of the Prep Centre�s standard issue ball
gags.

&nbsp;

There in the middle of Clegg�s desk was an
architectural model. It looked like quite an old house � a late Elizabethan
manor house butted onto the keep of an earlier castle was my guess. The house
was surrounded by a moat and outside of that by a circular bank. I was peering
closely at it when Freddie came in with Harry and a visitor, a young man
wearing a loud check sports jacket.

&nbsp;

�Ahha,� said the
visitor, in an ear splitting Brooklyn accent.
�You�re admiring my new home. Whaddya think?�

&nbsp;

�This is Ross,� said Clegg introducing me.
�Larry Ross.�

&nbsp;

�Sure, sure,� the visitor said. �I�ve heard
about you. Big help around here.�

&nbsp;

I tried to smile modestly but it was difficult
to hide the pleasure of being recognised for the work I was doing.

&nbsp;

�This,� said Clegg, pointing at the
newcomer, �is the Emir of Kolin� Clegg saw my look of
surprise. He certainly didn�t sound like any of the Kushtians that I had met so
far. �He has recently inherited the title. He�s been living in the States for
the last fourty years,�

&nbsp;

�Like forever,� the Emir cut in with a
grin. 

&nbsp;

Clegg smiled tolerantly and continued �And
he�s coming to the UK to
establish trading links between Kushtia and with various UK companies. The Kalinin is apparently very keen to have
commercial links here. We have another little project on for the Emir with one
of our other divisions,� Clegg gestured at the model, �and now he would like us
to help out with the sort of task that you and Harry are such experts at.
Harry; thank you for bringing Sarah along, she can take notes, there will be
quite a lot to do.�

&nbsp;

�Ah, she works too, does she?� The Emir
smiled. �Thought she was just the office eye candy.�
Sarah looked as though she was embarrassed by his remarks � she still hadn�t
really got used to being viewed as a sex object � but she liked being noticed
too.

&nbsp;

The �other division� turned out to be the
company that Clegg used for construction projects. Most of that was legitimate
work but they also had a side-line constructing dungeons and other secure
accommodation for slave keepers. They had lots of experience with concrete set
metal bars, heavy doors, underground construction, that sort of thing. Clegg�s
team had been extending and converting the Emir�s new home in the
Worcestershire countryside. He�d bought it cheaply after a plan to convert the
building into a hotel had collapsed. The developers had got as far as
installing the pool, the gym and the spa and creating 20 bedrooms in what was
the old castle keep. They�d built the golf course. Then the money had run out.

&nbsp;

�Work is going fine,� the Emir said. �All on schedule and to what I understand to be Mr Clegg�s usual
standards of quality. What�s needed now is the
final preparations for the soft furnishings.�

&nbsp;

The Emir could see I looked puzzled. �Ah,
please excuse my euphemism,� he said, �by soft furnishings I mean my wives and
concubines. Let me explain.� He went to pick up his briefcase from the desk. As
he did so he got the view that I had been enjoying for some time. Although from
The Emir�s side, Sarah�s skirt looked had extremely modest, draping across her
lap and falling to the middle of her calves, from my side you could see that it
was slit to the hip, showing her legs off beautifully. �Oh, very nice,� said
the Emir. �Hey Larry, you�ve been holding out on me, enjoying that.� He nodded
to Freddie. �Do you mind,� he said waving a thumb at Sarah. She looked worried.

&nbsp;

�Not at all,� said Freddie, �help yourself.�

&nbsp;

�Great,� said the Emir pulling papers from
the case. As he started to consult the documents his free hand dived inside
Sarah�s blouse, squeezing and pinching at her tits. �She gave a muffled squeak
of pain. The Emir ignored her reactions. �Now youse
guys, here�s the game. I�ve got five wives and three girls that are, let�s say, going to be �living in� for my amusement. They are
prime Kushtian womanhood. Man of my status only gets to wed the best.� Sarah
gave another squeak in response to the Emir�s attentions. �And I like to take
care of my wives. Freddie here has done a good job on the hotel facilities. I�m
going to need some staff to keep the ladies comfortable.�

&nbsp;

Harry looked interested. Clegg looked smug.
He could tell this was going to involve a multiple collection of some sort or a
way of shifting some stock. �But you won�t be looking for additional wives or
bed mates?� I said, looking as always to the higher margin opportunities.

&nbsp;

�Well, I am going to need some local girls
for entertaining my customers. And I don�t mean playing checkers if you get my
drift. So no wives but we�ll need some girls that can bounce to order.�� 

&nbsp;

�OK,� I said, �so what are you looking for
in the staff line?�

&nbsp;

�I�ve got a list here,�
he said, �your girl here can type it up later.� He rolled up the paper and
pushed it down the front of her blouse until it was wedged in Sarah�s cleavage.
She gave a disconcerted whimper. �But mainly what we need is a beautician /
hairdresser, a nurse, a dietician, someone to keep the girls fit and four maid
servants to keep the place clean. On top of that I think I need three maybe
four for entertaining. I�d just like to see a selection of what you�ve got in
stock for that, I�m not too fussy. Just as long as they�re
equipped and willing.�

&nbsp;

�Well, what do you think, gentlemen?�
Freddie said to Harry and myself. 

&nbsp;

Harry spoke first, �I�m sure we can come up
with some possibilities. The research teams have been doing well lately and
were building a bigger and bigger database of potential acquisitions. I�d
suggest that we try to pull together a list of maybe�s and then get you to look
over them Emir, to see which of them will fit the bill.�

&nbsp;

�Sure,� said the Emir, still toying with
Sarah�s breasts. �That sounds great. If the pick-ups are as good as the staff,�
a pinch to the nipple brought another squeak from the gagged Sarah, �I�ll be
happy. Why don�t you bring your ideas up to the castle next week? Your guys
will be finished by then won�t they?� Freddie nodded. �OK come up to the
castle, you can show me what you propose and I�ll show you where they�ll be
working.�

&nbsp;

�That sounds fine,� I said.

&nbsp;

�Great,� said the Emir. �Oh, and bring this
little cutie with you.� He pinched Sarah again. �She�s fun to have around.� ��

Chapter 43 : Into
Worcestershire

&nbsp;

A week later, Harry and I met up in Harry�s office in the
Prep Centre. It was only about an hour�s drive to the Emir�s new home but we
wanted to give ourselves plenty of time.

&nbsp;

Harry summoned Sarah. �Have you got the folders?� he asked.

&nbsp;

Sara, neat and efficient as ever placed a pile of file
folders on the desk. �Yes, sir,� she said. I think you�ll find that it�s just
as you wanted. There�s a folder for each of the potential acquisitions and a
summary sheet for each category. I�ve tried to make it all as clear as possible
and�.�

&nbsp;

�That�s all right Sarah, I�m sure it�s fine.� Sarah allowed
herself a smile of satisfaction.

&nbsp;

�Well, I like to do a good job, as you know.�

&nbsp;

�Sure Sarah,� said Harry. �Still we�d better get you ready
if you�re coming with us.� He reached into his drawer and pulled out a pair of
handcuffs.

&nbsp;

�Oh,� she said, �but surely you don�t need that. I mean, I�m
part of the team now, I�ve done all this work with Rick and��

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry Sarah, you know the rules.� Harry said, bluntly.
�I can�t take you out of here unsecured. Even with your collar on,� she
fingered the tags that held her identity details. �In fact, I think you�re
forgetting your place, young lady. You�ll be gagged as well.�

&nbsp;

Sarah looked pained but did nothing further to object.� �Now put these on.�� He passed her a pair of handcuffs.

&nbsp;

She picked them up and fastened one of them around her
wrists. �Is that tight enough?� she asked, falling into a more compliant mood. 

&nbsp;

�That�s fine,� said Harry. �Now this gag,
please.� Harry handed her one of the gags that Rick had been experimenting with
since the client presentation we had given at Freddie�s club. 

&nbsp;

�Shouldn�t there be a strap with this?� Sarah asked, turning
the object over in her hands. It looked like the mouth piece of a snorkel but
with a small ball shaped rubbery swelling where the air hole would normally be.


&nbsp;

�No, that�s all right. Just push the ball into your mouth
and grip the rubber piece between your teeth� 

&nbsp;

Sarah looked confused. �Oh, but it�s far too small. It�ll
never work. Let me get one of the standard gags from my desk.�

&nbsp;

�Sarah,� said Harry. �Please just do as you are told.� Sarah
looked sheepish and put the mouthpiece between her lips, taking the small ball
into her mouth. Within a moment the gel began to swell with the warmth of her
mouth. The startled look on Sarah�s face was a delight. She squealed as the
golf ball more than doubled in size, stuffing her mouth until her cheeks bulged
with the pressure of the expanding gel. A rigid tube through the centre of the
gel maintained an airway but her mouth was completely filled and there was no
question of her pushing the gag out, even without a strap to hold it in place.
Her hands flew up to her bulging cheeks but there was nothing she could do
about the mouth filling gel. �Humwumhumph,� was the
only sound she could make.

&nbsp;

I had to confess to being impressed. Harry was too. �It�s
the first time I�ve tried one,� he said. Sarah looked distressed at the idea of
being a guinea pig for the technology.�
�But after that, I think I�ll be using them on field operations.�� He reached into one of the drawers of his
desk and pulled out one of the nylon sacks of the type we�d used on the Questor pick up. �This will stop our friend here from
getting too messy on the journey,� Harry said adding to Sarah�s confused
concern as he fitted the bag around her and zipped it up to her neck collar
before tightening the straps so that her arms were locked against her sides and
her legs were locked together. �Let�s go.�

&nbsp;

He picked up the bagged and gagged Sarah and tossed her
across his shoulder. I followed him out to the car park, grinning at Sarah�s
plumped out cheeks as she wriggled around on Harry�s shoulder.

�

We put Sarah into the boot of the car and strapped her in so
she wouldn�t bounce around. �Just remember, girl, you�re not staff, you�re
stock,� said Harry, bluntly, as he shut the lid. 

&nbsp;

I rode up front with Harry. An hour later we turned off of
the road past a broken down sign that had been put up for the hotel. The drive
wound through trees and then the castle itself appeared. Far more imposing than
the model had suggested, the grey bulk of the old circular castle keep rose
behind the red brick of the Tudor house, slowly filling our view as we
approached it.

&nbsp;

The Emir was there to greet us. �Nice to see you guys.
Welcome to Worcestershire.� Harry opened the boot. �And you brought the girl
too, great. She�ll love some of the facilities.� Sarah looked unconvinced as
she climbed out of the back of the car. The Emir made no attempt to conceal his
pleasure at the sight of her legs as Harry unzipped her from her sack and
helped her to clamber out. �We might as well start the tour right away,� he
said waving us in through the door. 

&nbsp;

The manor house itself was unremarkable. Comfortable and
well furnished but hardly anything unusual. The castle keep however was very
different. We walked across a covered way from the manor house into the keep at
first floor level, emerging into a circular room in the middle of the keep.
Ranged around us were a series of heavy wooden doors.

&nbsp;

�These were the hotel rooms,� said the Emir, �but your man
Clegg�s made them better suited for less willing occupants. Look at this one.�
He pulled open a door. It was solid oak with a heavy lock. We looked inside. It
wasn�t too small. There were four bunk beds, solidly built and equipped with
shackle rings at each corner. The room still had its bathroom but there was no
door. The room had one window but criss-crossed bars covered it. As we looked
around it was obvious that anyone staying in the room would have little
opportunity to escape. �Freddie�s team do a real neat job.� He gestured to the
ceiling. �Audio and video surveillance of course, linked to voice and movement
activated recorders in the main building. And the whole building has RFID
sensors fitted so we can put tags on the girls � we�ll use anklets � that will
let us track any of them wherever they are in the complex. Same sort of
technology that you use in the Prep Centre, Freddie tells me. That way we can
let them get on with their duties but still have them under control. You can
let your girl out of handcuffs if you like; her collar will be tracked here
too.�

&nbsp;

Harry looked impressed as he freed Sarah from her cuffs. He
took a small cartridge from his pocket and screwed the nozzle into the front of
Sarah�s gag. It gave a hiss as the CO2
rushed through the tube that wound, capillary like, through the gel. As the gas
discharged the gel inside Sarah�s mouth was cooled and shrank back to its
original size. Harry prised the mouthpiece from Sarah�s lips to her relief and
popped the device in his pocket. Sarah coughed, spluttered, worked her aching
jaw, and looked sheepish but said nothing. �Well when we get them it looks like
you�ll be able to hang on to them,� said Harry. �We�ve got some files to go
through with you, possible pick ups. Like we agreed.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah sure,� said the Emir, �but I�ve got something else to
show you first. Come through here.� He showed us the way through a low stone
arch. �Look at these walls � seven feet thick � solid stone, terrific building
� these guys knew how to make things to last.� It led to a spiral staircase cut
into the thickness of the wall of the castle keep. He pointed upwards. �There�s
another three floors up there,� he said. �Plenty of room for
expansion. But I want to show you down here. This is the real goods.� We
followed him down, Sarah tagging dutifully along behind us.

&nbsp;

The foot of the stairs brought us out into a dark stone line
cellar. The Emir turned a control by the door and the lights came on slowly
revealing that one half of the circle had been divided up into a series of
cages. Some of them were small with a single low door, their occupants would be
unable to stand up when inside them, two in the middle would allow some
movement, two on the right were very narrow; once
inside the occupant would be unable to sit down or lie down. �This used to be the
dungeon,� the Emir said. �They�d converted it to a wine cellar. Well, I like
wine as much as the next man but there are limits, I thought I�d put it back to
its original use. Plus, I get to keep some of my toys in here.� he pushed a
switch that turned on a battery of spot lights. Whoever had the misfortune to
be occupying the cages would have an unrestricted view of a range of unpleasant
devices that could be used on them.

&nbsp;

Sarah was obviously disconcerted by the sight of a series of
medieval implements of restraint and torture but said nothing.

&nbsp;

�Ain�t this the goods?� the Emir
said. �They�re all accurate replicas. Had some guys from your Tower
 of London check them out. Said they
were just like the ones in their museum. Pillory, stocks,
whipping post, gibbet cage, rack. Make me feel like the Sheriff of Nottingham, all I need is a Maid Marian, now.� He smirked at
Sarah. �Say, why don�t you let the boys see how good
you could make some of this stuff look.�

&nbsp;

�Oh,� said Sarah. �I�m not sure. They all look horrid. I
don�t think�.�

&nbsp;

�Now, Sarah,� Harry interrupted. �I think you�ll look good
in the pillory. You ought to oblige the Emir.�

&nbsp;

Sarah still looked uncomfortable but agreed and walked
across to it. She was about to lift the bar that would lock her head and wrists
in place when the Emir stopped her.

&nbsp;

�Say, what�s your name, why don�t you take that jacket off, give us all a better view.� Sarah looked across at Harry but
if she was expecting him to intervene she was disappointed. He just nodded. The
blouse she was wearing was pale pink, tight and high necked with long, loose
sleeves. �Hmm,� said the Emir, that�s not going to really show it off well,
you�d better lose the blouse.�

&nbsp;

Sarah complied, putting it with her jacket on a chair.
�Perhaps you�d like me to take of my skirt as well, Sir,� she said. Harry
looked approving.

&nbsp;

�Excellent, excellent, you�ve got the idea,� said the Emir,
grinning as Sarah unzipped her skirt. �Now put your head in the centre there
and you wrists up here. Then all I have to do is to lower this beam. See how it
just fits around your neck,� Sarah gave a cough as the beam came down, �and
your wrists. Nice and snug fitting, see. Then all we
do is clip a padlock in this fastening here and you�re
all secure.� 

&nbsp;

Harry picked up a device from the table opposite the
pillory. �Isn�t this a scold�s bridle?� he said. �Let�s try this on as well.�
Sarah looked distressed. But the Emir was obviously pleased that his toys were
attracting approval. Harry picked up the bridle, amused by the fact that it
carried a pair of metal asses ears, as well as the
metal bands designed to enclose the head. 

&nbsp;

�Be my guest,� he said, watching as Harry unfastened the
cage of metal bands and fitted it around Sarah�s head, postioning
the inverted Y over her nose and pushing the metal piece into her mouth to
press down on her tongue. He fixed it shut at the back of her head with the
small padlock that hung from the neck band. He pulled Sarah�s hair through to
let it fall loosely around her face. 

&nbsp;

�Gech icch
goff,� complained Sarah, �icchs
eggy ng icchs
hurging ghi goucth.� She shook her head without effect. Nobody took any
notice.

&nbsp;

�It�s all authentic stuff,� the Emir said. �I studied this
at college in the States, never thought I�d get to actually put it to use.
She�ll find that a bit heavy after a while, it�s made of steel same as the
original.� He walked around behind her. �This girl of yours might have been
built for this,� he said, licking his lips at the sight of Sarah in her bra,
panties stockings and suspender belt, locked in the pillory with her head
trapped in the scold�s brindle. 

&nbsp;

Harry smiled. The Emir ran his hands across Sarah�s thighs
and buttocks. �Yes,� he said, �very nice. She�s a cute girl like I said. How
much do you want for her? Can we add her to the shipment for here?�

&nbsp;

Sarah gave a squeak of alarm from inside the bridle. �Well,�
said Harry. �We hadn�t thought about selling her. I guess it�s a possibility.� Another squeak from Sarah. �But we couldn�t do it straight
away. We could lend her to you, I guess.�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� I said. �Your Minister of Trade was kind enough to
lend me his secretary for an evening in Kushtia, this
seems only fair in return.�

&nbsp;

The Emir looked a little concerned. �Well, I don�t want to
take advantage and Kushtian hospitality is never given in the expectation of
any return. I mean like I know youse brought her over
here and everything. So, well, look how about if I rent her for a while. You
can see how you get on without her, I can see if she fits in.� Sarah squealed
again, the scold�s bridle stopping her from making any articulate protest. 

&nbsp;

I remembered a paper I had back in my brief case. �I�ve got
a rental agreement with me,� I said. Elly had been
drawing one up and I�d printed out a copy. �Our legal department has been
working on a standard one for us. It covers all the usual stuff; waiver in the
event of damage caused by the item being rented, acceptance of liability for
any permanent damage caused to the item, that sort of thing.�

&nbsp;

�Sure thing, said the Emir. �That sounds fine. Youse got to protect your assets. Especially
if the assets have arses like this.� He smirked, giving Sarah�s backside
a pat. �If we go back to the house I�ll sign it. Plus you can show me what you�re
proposing.�

&nbsp;

Harry gave Sarah a wave. She looked distressed as we left
her in the dungeon to head back to the house.

�� 

Back in the Emir�s lounge, I got out the rental agreement
that Ellie had drafted up for me. I filled in a few details to cover the rental
of Sarah. He didn�t even read it but scrawled a signature across the bottom. I
rummaged in my case and found the summary that Sarah had typed up from our
earlier meeting. �Well, Emir,� I began.

&nbsp;

�Hey, come on,� the Emir, let�s not keep this so formal.
Call me Brad.�

&nbsp;

�OK, Brad,� I responded. �Now, I think what you were looking
for was a beautician, a nurse / dietician, hairdresser, a fitness coach and
four house maids, plus three or four for entertaining. I hear you�ve already
picked out some stock for the entertainments, so we�re only talking about the
staff at the moment. Right?�

&nbsp;

�Spot on Larry, spot on,� Brad smiled. �Four very nice
pieces from your stock room, I must say. We don�t have to take so much trouble
over the fuck-bunnies but they look as though they�ll give my guests a good
time. Your man Rick seems to have a good training programme going there.�

&nbsp;

�Well yes, he does, I guess. Anyway we�ve got some proposals
for the rest of the staff. Our research people managed to track down these two
as possibles for your beautician / hairdresser. They
are two sisters, set up their business last year specialising in an
in-your-home service. They go out with a sort of travelling beauty parlour.
They also run a web site where they give beauty tips on-line and show some
examples of their work. Here look,� I took out my lap top and turned it on. I�d
canned a version of their site to show the Emir. I took him through it.

&nbsp;

�They seem to do quite a good job, looking at this stuff,�
Brad said. �Sisters, you say?� I nodded. �Well they�d be unhappy if we split
them up. I reckon you should get the pair of them. I�ll be able to use them.
Got to keep the girls looking cute, haven�t we?�

&nbsp;

�Fine,� I said always happy to add to the quota. Harry
grunted approvingly. I knew he�d reckon it was easier to snatch both of them
than one. �Now, I�ve got some video of the next one. We thought this would do
for your fitness coach.� I fired up the video we�d had taken. A group of girls
were playing beach volley ball. They all looked fit but of the four, one team
was of a rather muscular build while of the others the girl playing at the back
was long legged and blonde, her partner equally leggy but with short cropped dark
hair. �That�s our suggestion,� I said pointing to the blonde girl as she leapt
forward to knock the ball back over the net to her opponents. It came straight
back. Her partner intercepted it and pushed it high and away towards the back
corner of their opponent�s court. They just reached it. A diving, two handed
blow pushed the ball back up again towards the net. The other girl batted it up
intending for her partner to slam it to the floor across the net but instead
the ball headed over the net. As it did so, the blonde dived forward, tipping
the ball back over the net to fall between two of her opponents. She and her
partner threw their hands up in excitement. It was obviously the winning point.
They embraced one another, but it was fairly obvious that the kiss between the
two girls was more than you�d normally get for a winning point. Giggling the
two of them fell to the sand, locked together while their opponents looked on
amused, hands on hips.�� 

&nbsp;

�She�s 28 years old, a qualified physiotherapist and a diploma
in sports medicine. She�s trained volleyball, tennis and ladies soccer players.
Plus as you can see, she�s pretty well set up herself. Prefers the company of
girls to men, as you can see, but I�m assuming that won�t worry you.� 

&nbsp;

The Emir gave a smirk. �What about her girl friend? She�s
cute too.�

�

�She�s 26, not qualified as far as we can tell. She runs,
middle distance stuff mainly, pretty good club performer but she�s never going
to make it to the Olympics. She�s been shacked up with our target for about six
months, but she�ll get over her soon enough.�

&nbsp;

�Seems a shame to split them up,� said Brad. �Being so fond of each other and all. I think I can run to
the two of them.�

&nbsp;

I tried not to grin, but things were going pretty much as
I�d hoped. �OK,� I said. �Now for your nurse, we found this a bit further down
the beach.� I pushed a series of grainy photographs towards Brad. Obviously
taken with a telephoto lens and then blown up they showed two girls, both
blondes, sun bathing in bikinis. �The one in red is our suggestion. She 25, Dutch, qualified as a nurse last year in Holland.
The girl in blue is her friend, she�s Dutch too, over
here in the UK
to improve her English. Works as a secretary in the local
hospital.� I flipped another picture in front of him,
The girl in blue had stood up and was towelling dry her hair. The girl in red
was sitting up, leaning with her hands on the sand behind her, looking up at
her friend.

&nbsp;

�Are these two candidates for the little Dutch boy?� Brad
asked. I looked blank.

�You know, the one that saved the
country by sticking his finger in the dyke. They look like an item too.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah,� I said, �you could be right. We think they�re that way.
But don�t let that worry you. We can set things up so it looks like she�s
responsible for the fact that her friend�s gone missing. The papers love that
sort of stuff.� I was thinking back to the coverage that Rachel�s disappearance
had generated when the press had found out that her chauffeuse had gone missing
too.

&nbsp;

�No, no, I can�t have that,� Brad smiled. �Gotta have the two of them as well.�

&nbsp;

�I think that will put us rather over budget, Emir,� I said.
�I wouldn�t want there to be any difficulties with the Trade Minister as a
result.�

&nbsp;

�Don�t you worry about that. I can
square him. This isn�t all on his budget anyway. I�ll be picking up quite a bit
of the cost. But then like I say you got to be in to win. Eh,
Larry boy???�

&nbsp;

�Just as long as you�re happy,� I said.

&nbsp;

�Sure, sure,� he answered.

&nbsp;

�Well, it�s fine by me,� said
Harry. �Leaves fewer loose ends around. Makes the pick
ups easier.�

&nbsp;

�OK then,� said Brad, �that�s about it I guess.� His mobile
phone bleeped and he looked down at it. �Uh oh,� he said, �message from the
boss.�

&nbsp;

�How about the house maids?� 

&nbsp;

He was looking down at his phone. �Uh, oh,
yeah. Look I�m sure you can pick those out. I�ll trust your call. Give
me one of your order forms, will you?� I pushed the document across to him. He
scribbled in �14 items, as agreed,� and signed it. �Look, I�m sorry I�ve got to
go. Urgent meeting. I�ll be off for a few days. Don�t
worry about your girl, Sarah. I�ll brief the guards to see she�s looked after.
We�ll sort things out when I get back. Just get on with the pick-ups can you? I
need to grab some stuff.��� 

&nbsp;

The Emir�s signature was good enough for me. Harry and I
gathered up our things. We were just about ready to leave when Brad came
dashing back into the lounge carrying a small overnight bag. �Can youse guys give me a lift to the airport?� he said. �Only
my driver�s in town and I don�t want to miss the next flight.�

&nbsp;

�Sure,� said Harry. I agreed with him. After an order for 14
pieces and a rental for Sarah, I felt it was the least we could do.

&nbsp;

It was as we were on the way back I could tell that Harry
was working himself up to say something. He was never the most talkative but he
developed a tense look that told me he was worried. It turned out that it
wasn�t about the Emir or Sarah. He wasn�t happy about what was happening with
Rachel. He thought I was giving Rick a good enough steer.

&nbsp;

�Look, Larry,� he said. �I don�t want to talk out of line
and you can tell me it�s none of my business but you�ve always been pretty
straight with me about things. You need too do something about Rachel. You
commissioned Rachel�s collection but now she�s a problem and you seem to be
leaving it all up to Rick. It�s too much of a mess.�

&nbsp;

�Hang on,� I said. �He�s the expert.�

&nbsp;

�He�s the expert at doing what he does. It ain�t no good if what he does
isn�t what�s needed. You�re going to have to pick up the ball. The �see if she
can survive being fucked ten times a day� approach hasn�t worked and the �let�s
take her mind off it with drugs� approach looks close to disaster too. You�re
the only one who can tell Rick that he should be doing something else. And the
fact that you think you can get by without her now isn�t an excuse.� 

&nbsp;&nbsp;

Chapter 44 : Stimulation

&nbsp;

I�d taken on board what Harry was saying but I really hadn�t
decided what to do about it. If what Harry had to say hadn�t been enough, the
earful I got from Freddie the following day made the point even more strongly.
He asked to see me in his office. When I got there Elly
had evidently just finished a conversation with him. He didn�t look happy. Elly just looked at me, dropped a file on Clegg�s desk and
said �See you later,� to him She gave a nod to me but said nothing more and
left. 

&nbsp;

Clegg gestured for me to take a seat. �How�s things with the
Emir?� he asked.

&nbsp;

�OK,� I said. Harry�s got research to do some collection
proposals. The Emir�s happy with them. He�s going to take 14 pieces from
us.� Some will come from stock but most
will be custom collections.� I�d expected him to be pleased with the news but
it didn�t look like he was.

&nbsp;

�Larry,� he said, �That�s fine. Good news.� He moved quickly
on, evidently keen to get to what he really wanted to
talk about. �Look, I know operations aren�t your responsibility but I�m
worried. There�s been too many cock-ups recently in
the field and in the Prep Centre. And then there was the business with Brian.
The difficulty with all this custom collection work is that it means we�re
being more selective about targets. I�m not sure we�re taking account of the
extra risks the you get when you go after someone
specific rather than just collecting opportunities. It was your idea to go down
this track. The business needs to deal with the consequences but you need to
get on board with that too. I got Elly to do some
rooting around on some of the problems. She�s just been filling me in. The only
good thing is that it looks as though the Brian thing was well contained. Seems
like he wasn�t just keeping down sales prices he was skimming the receipts as
well. The people who thought he was helping them are most upset. They actually
sounded grateful that we�d taken him out. Sure, they like to make a bit of
money but they don�t like things be de-stabilised any more than I do. Not sure
where that leaves him when I�ve done with him though. Nobody�s even interested
in him as meat. As to the rest of it, Elly was pretty
scathing. The whole team�s got too bloody casual. It needs to be tightened up.
If we carry on like we are doing then someone�s going to get killed or
worse.�� 

&nbsp;

�Well, hang on,� I said defensively. �I�m not sure that you
can point deficiencies in operations or the prep centre at me. I know Brian was
pissed off because of what I�d been doing but that�s hardly my fault is it?�

&nbsp;

�No,� said Clegg, �it�s not. But, and it�s a big but, if
this organisation as a whole can�t cope with the attentions of that incompetent
better than we did then we�re in trouble. If one of our own folk gets snatched
by amateurs; if one of our own folk lets herself get snatched by amateurs; if we
only avoid you getting picked up by chance; if we let your writer run amok and
break out of the Prep Centre; if we have our sales director running scams on
the inside of the business and no one knows; if the Prep centre is so heavy
handed it gets to blister the mind of one of our assets,� I looked blank, �your
bloody writer � Rachel; then I think the business has a problem. And if you
don�t think that�s part of your responsibility then maybe I have a problem with
you.�

&nbsp;

�Hey, I�m not backing away from any of this but I can�t do
other people�s jobs. You didn�t hire me because of what I knew about this
business, remember?�

&nbsp;

�No, I didn�t. But I do expect some level of involvement.
And I need to see some follow through on the consequences of getting into this
approach to market. Now I�ll admit I haven�t pressed you on this. But I�m
pressing you now Larry, I�m pressing you now. And you won�t want me to press
you any harder. Believe me.�

&nbsp;

Something about his humourless smile made me very certain
that I agreed with him.

&nbsp;

�The first thing we�re going to do is fix your writer,� he
said bluntly. �I don�t like wasting assets. You wanted her, you can take the
lead.�

&nbsp;

�Well, I �m not sure we can, I�ve spoken to Rick and �.�
Clegg�s cold stare cut me off.

&nbsp;

�I said it�s going to be fixed. I�ve spoken to Rick about a
few things too, including this and he�s feeling much more motivated now.� I
imagined the conversation had been along similar lines. �He�s made some
progress. Got a new approach. Looks as though it might
work, Go talk to him again. And then come back and tell me how you�re going to
fix it. That�s not �if�, Larry, that�s �how�! Don�t take it personally. I�m
going to be pretty intolerant of cock-ups all round from now, but this one is
very much on your priority list. I�m interested in your continued well-being
Larry. Don�t disappoint me.�

� 

I left Clegg�s office feeling somewhere between deeply
uncomfortable and scared shitless. Whether or not it was personal it was pretty
clear that any failure would result in some personal attention and I didn�t
think it was about to be a quiet coaching session. In fairness, I had to admit
he was right but it didn�t make me any more comfortable about the possible
outcomes.� 

&nbsp;

I bumped into Rick in the corridor at the Prep Centre and
told him Freddie had asked me to talk to him about Rachel. �Yes,� he said,
�Freddie had a chat with me, too.� He gave a look that suggested he�d left his
discussions with Clegg in about as comfortable a state as I had. �So, it looks
like we need to try and fix this.� 

&nbsp;

I asked whether he�d made any progress with Rachel, whether
he�d found anything yet that might be able to help her.

&nbsp;

�No,� he said. �We stopped the drugs and we�ve put her on a
fairly minimal security regime while we�ve been trying to think of some other
stuff. The good news is that she seems to be recovering. No more compliant than
before but certainly less damaged than I thought. There could be something
there to work with after all but we need a different approach.�

&nbsp;

�What sort of �different approach�, more drugs or what?�

&nbsp;

�Nuh,� Rick shook his head.
�There�s one idea that one of the team came up with. We were working on it
before Elly got Clegg all wound up about things. They
thought that maybe instead of trying to break her we should just give her a
really comfortable environment, let her recover as best she could, and then,
well�. Look have you got some time?�

&nbsp;

I looked at my watch. �Mm, sure,� I said. �I want things to
turn out for her. I am responsible, I guess. I had her snatched after all. It�s
not her fault things moved on. Plus Freddie wants some feed-back on what we�re
going to do. He�s taking a personal interest. I can see it wouldn�t be a great
idea to disappoint him.� 

&nbsp;

�Yeah, I know. The good thing is that it was what Freddie
has set up for Brian�s family that gave us the idea for this. You know he was
really angry about all that you know. I wondered if there wasn�t going to be
blood spilled in a deliberate, unpleasant and terminal fashion over it.�

&nbsp;

�You�re not telling me that he�s mellowed? Decided to send
them all off for a pleasant holiday somewhere with his compliments?�

&nbsp;

�That�s not really Freddie, is it? Look at what he asked us
to set up for the wife, the sister and the two girls. Here.� Rick pulled back a
curtain that had covered a viewing panel. Behind it were four tables each of
which had one of Brian�s family strapped down to it. They weren�t struggling. Alice
was nearest, then Carol and then the two girls Beth and Ella. All four were
naked and as far as I could tell as hairless as when I had last seen them.
Wires ran from an overhead gantry to each woman�s nipples, labia and clitoris.
From the way that each was bucking and twitching in turn it was evident that
they were being stimulated electrically. Every so often one or the other would
give a sigh, a low moan or a short grunt. I assumed it had been going on for
some time. �The wires provide low frequency stimulation directly to their
arousal centres. There�s a sort of randomiser so they�ll be stimulated in left
or right nipple, clitoris, anus in different sequences
one after another. They are sedated but they are already showing signs of
distress when we turn the current off. I think it should be soon time to move
them on to the next stage.�

&nbsp;

�Something more intense? Hang on.
Did you say they�re distressed when you turn the current off?�

&nbsp;

�Oh yes. They are becoming addicted to the stimulation. So
the next stage isn�t really to make it any more intense. Quite
the reverse in some ways. What we do next is to provide them with a
highly normalised environment. Comfortable surroundings,
bright colours, good food, opportunities for relaxation. Except they get
to learn that they can have intense sexual stimulation whenever they want it.
We�ve designed a device that fits like a thong, a radio receiver triggers it.
Using that, we can let them learn that they can gain stimulation with
conforming behaviour. They can try self stimulation of course but they�ll find
that it�s not as intense as what we can deliver through the thong. Pleasure is
very addictive.� 

&nbsp;

�But I�m not sure I see how this helps us with Rachel. I
don�t even really see what the end point for them is. How does this help
Freddie�s need for revenge on Brian?�

&nbsp;

�Well, can�t we use the same approach on Rachel?� The end point for this lot is that Clegg gets
four females, completely addicted to sex that will do
almost anything for the sexual stimulation that they crave. I am sure he can
find a use for that.� Rick gave a smirk.

&nbsp;

�And Freddie�s revenge?�

&nbsp;

Rick pressed another button and a light lit at the back of
the room. There, strapped to a chair, fully able to watch every aspect of the proceedings, was Brian. �He�s watching every last part of
it,� said Rick. �Freddie�s really quite pleased that he�s going to be able to
watch his wife, sister-in-law and daughters turning tricks because they want
to.�

&nbsp;

�Sounds like something the Emperor Tiberius would have
thought of.�

&nbsp;

�Funny you should say that,� Rick came back. �Freddie�s got
a copy of Suetonius �The Twelve Caesars� on his desk
at the moment.�

&nbsp;

�I think we should all be worried by that. From what I
remember it didn�t turn out too well for any of them or many of the people
around them.����� 

&nbsp;

�No,� said Rick, I�m no classicist but I think you�re right.
Still to come back to the point in hand. I thought we
could use something similar for your writer. Do you want me to put her on the
same regime?�

&nbsp;

�Let me think about it,� I said. It seemed like it might
offer some possibilities but I was worried. I suspected that Rachel�s almost
catatonic state had been the result of trauma from her use of the memory of
rape as the diversion from her conditioning added to the effect of the drugs. I
wasn�t sure that more sex was the answer. Leastways not at
first.��

Chapter 45 : The Emir�s Photo
Collection

�

&nbsp;

�Yes, that�s right, Janice, it�s for a photo shoot. �. Well,
I saw the stuff you do on your web site and I thought you�d be ideal for this.
I�ll cover your fees of course but I�ll credit your work on the pictures too.
They�ve been commissioned by a new magazine: South Coast � it�s going to be
promoting all sorts of businesses around here, this shoot is for their launch
issue. It should get a lot of attention. Anyway they want us to do a feature on
a couple of volley ball players, we�re going to want to do a sort of make over
shoot, some pics of them in their volley ball kit and
then in evening dress. So you�ll need to do a fairly high-energy make up and
hair for the first shots and something a bit more sophisticated for the evening
look. I guess you and Jilly can handle that? �. I
thought so. OK well if you can be at my studio tomorrow lunchtime, that will be
great. Keep it quiet though, the magazine doesn�t want anything to get out
about this until they do the launch. If it goes well you should have plenty
more opportunities like this. � Right, see you there.�

&nbsp;

I over heard Tricia�s phone call. It sounded like she had no
problem setting up Janice and Jillie, the make up
girls. Karen and Peta weren�t any trouble either when
Tricia called them. They were keen for some publicity as they saw it and, like
she said, the worst that can happen is you don�t like what the make up girls
do. 

&nbsp;

The next day in the photo studio we�d hired for the
occasion, Janice and Jillie were setting up their
stuff on a couple of tables to one side when I saw Karen and Peta coming up the alleyway towards us. They squeezed past
the van that almost blocked the alleyway and onto the stairs that led up to
where we were. 

&nbsp;

We were using Tricia and Eva, the girl she�d worked with on
the Questor pick up, for this. We thought the targets
would be more comfortable with a couple of female photographers. I was there
ostensibly to rig lighting. I just liked to watch the girls at work I guess.
Tricia and Eva seemed to get on and it looked like everything was working so
far. Tricia was keen to get a lead role but she didn�t mind working in to Eva
and Harry had been adamant that she needed a few more pick-ups under her belt
before he�d let her take charge of one. She and Harry had had a bit of an up
and downer about it. I was trying to stay out of it. At least it didn�t seem to
be interfering with this job. 

&nbsp;

The six of them were enjoying a glass of chilled wine before
getting started while I fiddled around with the flash stands and the
reflectors. Karen and Peta stripped down to their bra
and panties to let Janice and Jillie get started on
their make up and hair. There were some robes hanging by the chairs at the make
up desk but they didn�t bother with them. 

&nbsp;

Janice was just about to start on Peta�s
hair when Tricia and her friend went to work. The targets found themselves
staring into the barrel of an Ouzi and a pistol.
�Sorry, ladies,� Tricia announced. �Just be careful or it will be a different
type of shoot to the one you expected. Now keep your hands over your heads and
sit down on the floor.�

&nbsp;

Janice, Jillie, Karen and Peta followed instructions, staring up from the floor at
their attackers. 

&nbsp;

�Karen, Peta, on your face, please,
hands behind your backs.�� Tricia passed
two pairs of handcuffs to Janice and Jillie. �Put
those on them,� she ordered watching as Janice and Jillie
cuffed the two volley ball players, �and squeeze them closed real tight.
Tricia�s associate was rummaging in Karen and Peta�s
sports bags, she pulled out four pairs of sports
socks.

&nbsp;

�One pair each, ladies,� she said
tossing them to Janice and Jillie. Seeing their
puzzled look she pointed to her own mouth. �In the mouth,
girls, in the mouth. We want you four quiet. You two roll the others
over and stuff their mouths. Then do your own.�

&nbsp;

�No, please,� begged Janice. �We won�t make a sound. We�ll
be quiet.�

&nbsp;

�Will we, fuck,� growled Karen.

&nbsp;

Tricia grinned. �That�s what we thought,� she snarled. �Now
get on with it.� She aimed a swipe of her gun butt at Janice who fell into line
quickly. Cramming a pair of socks into Peta�s
mouth before doing the same for her own. She looked back plaintively at
Tricia. Jillie did the same for Karen. �Now some
tape,� said Eva, tossing a roll of gaffer tape across to Janice.� Jillie knelt on the
floor with her hands in the air, staring in fear at Tricia�s gun. �Three strips
- two diagonal cross ways over the mouth, one horizontal, use plenty and make
sure it�s pulled tight over those socks.��
Eva ordered Janice, watching as she did as she was told. �Great, you�ve
done that really well. Now do your own.�

&nbsp;

As Janice pulled the strips tight across her own face she
gave a muffled grunt. �Grunghhh,� she went. 

&nbsp;

Eva smiled. �Yeah, it works doesn�t it? Now do the other
two.� Janice taped over Peta�s mouth and then did the
same for Jillie before dropping the remainder of the
roll on the floor. She looked up at Tricia and Eva and raised her own hands in
resigned surrender.

&nbsp;

�Very good,� said Eva. �Now let�s get you two tied up.�

&nbsp;

�Hang on,� I said, interrupting things for the first time.
�Let�s have these two strip off. They�re looking a bit
over dressed alongside our sporty two.� Tricia and Eva exchanged a look that
said, �Men! Huh!� but they knew as well as I did that the more you did to
humiliate them early on in the game, the easier they were to deal with as
things went on. 

&nbsp;

�You heard the man,� said Eva. �Stay down on the floor but
get out of those dresses.� Janice gave a muffled whimper. Eva responded by
jamming her pistol into the girl�s cleavage. Get started if you don�t want an
extra button hole,� she snarled and Janice began to unfasten the buttons up the
front of her dress. As she pulled it from her shoulders, I got a good look at
her tits, she tried to hold her hands across her chest but Eva wasn�t having
any, ordering her to put her hands behind her. The gag muffled Janice�s sobs
but the tears on her cheek told the story of her distress and terror. Jillie offered no resistance as Tricia prodded her into
stripping like her friend. She gave each of the make-up girls a pair of
handcuffs and told them to lock their own wrists behind their backs before she
pushed them face down alongside Peta and Karen. We
let the four of them whimper helplessly while we cleared the place up. 

&nbsp;

It didn�t take long to get the girls down the stairs and
into the van; the alleyway wasn�t overlooked so we didn�t even have to wait
until dark. They were soon on their way. I suggested to Tricia that she and I might
go for a drink but she turned me down. She claimed that she and Eva still had
another pick up to plan but I thought it might have had something to do with me
insisting that Janice and Jillie strip off.

&nbsp;

Later it looked like I needn�t have worried. I was laying in bed in my hotel room, later that evening, flicking
idly though the channels on the TV when there was a knock at the door. �It�s
me,� said Tricia�s voice. �I thought we might have that drink��� I�d hoped we
might have some fun or maybe even talk through some of my problems. Instead
Tricia spent the time telling me that Harry really ought to let her lead a pick
up and she didn�t see why she had to go on playing second string to Eva. I sat
there listening or looking as though I was, and thinking that an evening with
Kelly would have been more amusing. In the end she went back to her own room. 

&nbsp;

I spent the rest of the time thinking about what I was going
to suggest to Clegg about Rachel. I�d had a long talk with the Prep Centre
doctor � the one that had helped me the time that Rachel attacked me. She had
agreed with me that the whole sex orientation thing was unlikely to work in the
short term after the traumatising effect of Rachel�s multiple rapes. She argued
that what Rachel needed was a chance to draw a line under that, to set herself
free from her past, to start again. In the longer term, having done that it
would be possible to use Rick�s approach but she was too unstable now. The Doc
argued that one of the ways forward could be to induce some sort of near-death
experience; to give her something to recover from and then to help that
recovery. That way she would come to see us as her saviours rather than her
oppressors; at least as long as she didn�t suspect that we were the authors of
her fate. The fact that she�d been on a less oppressive regime already would
help.� After that we could probably
introduce the sexual programming.

&nbsp;

I�d felt the Doc was making sense. It sounded like a better bet
than trying to shock her into sexual compliance from where she was now. I had
the ideal nurse available in Sukie, and from what I�d
seen Rachel trusted her. The Doc knew how to engineer the near death
experience. We just had too organise it and make sure
no one else knew about it.

&nbsp;

The discussion with Clegg turned out to be a lot less
difficult than I�d expected. But then I�d thought a lot about it.

&nbsp;

�You wanted me to tell you how I was going to fix the Rachel
problem,� I said, taking as positive an approach as I could.

&nbsp;

�Uhhuh,� said Clegg.

&nbsp;

�Well, I�ve got the answer. It depends on inducing an
immediate crisis for Rachel and assisting her recovery.� I talked him through
the Doctor�s hypothesis that Rachel would respond to the opportunity to draw a
line under her past life and start again. I didn�t explain how we were going to
achieve that and he didn�t press me. �After the induced crisis she�ll need an
extended time in recovery. I�ll want a minimum security suite. I�ll be living
in it myself � I want to keep this very close to me and I don�t think I can do
it in my flat. And I want Sukie assigned to the
project as well. I�ll need some help from the Doc
too.�

&nbsp;

Clegg looked thoughtful. �How long is extended?�

&nbsp;

�It could be six months. It could be less.�

&nbsp;

�We�re not talking �horse might talk� here are we?�

&nbsp;

�Sorry,� I said. �How do you mean?�

&nbsp;

�It�s a parable on the value of delaying tactics.� Clegg was
watching me closely. I looked him straight in the eye. �A man is about to be
executed by the King and he says, �Surely you wouldn�t execute the man who
could make your horse talk? Give me a year and I�ll do it.� The King agrees and
as the man is dragged off to the stables, one of the guards hisses at him, �You
can�t make his horse talk, can you?� And the man says, �In a year a lot can
happen. I might die, or the horse might die, or the King might die, � or the horse might talk.� You see Larry? I�d hate to
think you were thinking along those lines, Larry.���� 

&nbsp;

�Freddie,� I said, �I don�t have any other horses to back on
this one.� Clegg laughed. �I thought about using the techniques that are being
worked on Brian�s family but that�s not right for this. At
least not at first. This is the best bet.�

&nbsp;

�Good,� he said. �At least you�re committed. What shall we
call this project? �Mr. Ed�?�

Chapter 46 : Dutch Collection

&nbsp;

I couldn�t really justify the time to sit in on another
collection. I had Rachel to worry about and I really needed to finish off the
plans for putting in place a proper account management function now that Brian
was no longer around. Tricia and Eva seemed quite able to get on with it,
anyway. After all it was their job.

&nbsp;

I did take some time out to see how things were progressing
with Brian�s family though. Rick took me into one wing of the Prep Centre where
from the viewing corridor we were looking into not harsh prison cells but a
comfortable living area that looked like a small apartment. There were bright
colours, comfortable furniture, books on the table, CD�s and a stereo. Ella,
her mother and her aunt were al lounging in chairs around the room. They all
wore similar smock like dresses that hung from their collars, flowing loosely
and stopping well above their knees. The dresses were in bright, pastel
colours, pink Ella, pale yellow for Alice,
pale blue for for Carol. The women were all smiling
but didn�t appear to be doing anything. �It�s every bit as secure as the other
rooms,� said Rick, �but the occupants have complete freedom inside their area.
Here, here comes Beth now.�

&nbsp;

A door opened on the far side and Beth appeared. She looked
happy, tanned, and relaxed. She�d obviously just come from the shower. She had
one towel wrapped tightly around her body and another around her head. She
shook the second towel loose and sat on a chair, rubbing at her hair with the towel.
I could see that she was still wearing her collar but apart from that there was
no sign of any restraints.

&nbsp;

She dropped the other towel, leaving her almost naked. All
she wore was the briefest of thongs, simple, white, and barely covering her at
all.

&nbsp;

�This is all very pleasant, Rick,� I said, �but I�m not sure
what�s going on.�

&nbsp;

Rick, taking his usual irritating pleasure
in holding out for the least bit of dramatic effect, pulled a small control box
from his pocket with a flourish. �This,� he said, �provides a radio
signal to a tiny receiver that is held in Rachel�s vulva by that thong. It can
pulse on demand or deliver low frequency stimulation to the girl�s clitoris.
It�s possible to induce and maintain high levels of sexual arousal. Watch.� He pressed a button. 

&nbsp;

At once, Beth stopped what she was doing turned towards the
panel we were standing behind and said in a clear voice. �Oh, yes, please. I
want you to.� Rick pressed another button and Beth soon appeared to be highly
aroused, laying down on the couch, stroking her own
body, clutching at her groin, panting and keening with desire. Rick let the
effect continue for a while, until he pressed the button again and almost at
once, Beth�s arousal could be seen to diminish. She sat up catching her breath,
staring wistfully towards the screen. �Thank you,� she said. �More?� She looked
at the panel for a few moments but could see that nothing further was coming.
With a disappointed look she sank back down on the couch and picked up a
magazine. As she was leafing through it I could see it was one set or
pornographic pictures after another. She seemed to study some of the pictures
intently. She had completely forgotten that, apart from the thong, she was
naked.

&nbsp;

�Well,� I said, �I think I understand what I saw but I�m not
sure what it means. Why doesn�t she just take that thong off?�

&nbsp;

�Why should she want to? Then she wouldn�t get what she
wants most of all; sexual stimulation.�
It delivers frequent bouts of stimulation at irregular intervals,
keeping her in a slightly aroused state. From that point any further stimulus
creates a state of rapid arousal. If we brought one of the guards in for
instance, she would be desperate for sexual activity to raise herself up from the background level of arousal delivered by
the thong.�

&nbsp;

�And how do you stop them all just going at each other? If
they can get each others stimulation don�t they lose the need for the thong?�

&nbsp;

�Unapproved sexual activity is non-conformant behaviour. We
turn off their thong. The choice is between low level but regular, almost
continuous arousal coupled with satisfaction when approved or occasional
satisfaction but without the background of arousal. So far they�ve all chosen
the former.� 

&nbsp;

I had to admit it looked promising but I still thought that
carrying on with my current plans looked like the better start for Rachel.
Rick�s methods could, however, have us offering a much better service to those
who were looking to acquire slaves as sexual playthings. �How come you hadn�t
developed this before?� I asked.

&nbsp;

�We didn�t have the problem before, really. Don�t forget
when we�ve been collecting for stock we haven�t had to worry about the results
of training. As long as the girls were saleable for something then we weren�t
too worried what the outcome of orientation was. If they were damaged by the
process it just meant that they fetched a lower price. Actually, thinking about
it that might have been some of Brian�s problem. There had been a few cases of
�difficult� girls over the last year.�

&nbsp;

�Well it sounds like you needed to rethink the orientation
approach anyway.�

&nbsp;

Rick nodded, thoughtfully. �Yeah,� he said, �that�s pretty
much what Freddie said. But not quite in those words.� 

&nbsp;

I was still working at the Prep Centre later when Eva and Tricia
came in, pleased as anything and giggling like girls. �We�ve come up with a new
Clegg Enterprises product,� Eva announced as she came into my office. �You�ll
never guess what it is.�

&nbsp;

�You�re right,� I said. I�ve never been much good at
guessing games. �Does it involve your Dutch project?�

&nbsp;

�Oh yes,� said Tricia. �Absolutely!�

&nbsp;

�And this wonderful idea is?� I asked.

&nbsp;

�Tinned slaves!� Tricia and Eva
blurted out together, collapsing on the office couch with a peal of laughter.

&nbsp;

Harry, disturbed by the noise, came to see what was going
on.

&nbsp;

�Come and see,� said Eva and led the way out to the delivery
bay. There was one of the standard Clegg white vans. Behind, it was towing a
caravan. �There� said Eva, pointing to the caravan, �two tinned slaves. Probably
well stewed in their own juice by now.�

&nbsp;

Harry and I walked across to the van and climbed inside. The
muffled grunts of two gagged women told us that Eva and Tricia had been
successful. Eva climbed in behind us and lifted up the cushions of the bench
seat that ran across the caravan�s large front window. In the base of the seat,
wedged in between piles of clothes and boxes was a bikini-clad, bound and
gagged girl. She looked panic stricken, her eyes wide in terror, evidently
attempting to scream behind her gag. �Greetje Van Bruijn,� Eva announced, �who was so friendly as to invite
Tricia into her van for a cup of tea. Unfortunately Tricia popped a little
something in her cup and she ended up in there. All we had to do then was to
wait for Femke to get back from the hospital.�

�And she is where?� Harry asked.

&nbsp;

Eva and Tricia were enjoying the theatrics. �Ta � da!� Tricia said as she
pulled open the door of the caravan�s bath cabinet. Sat inside on the chemical
closet was Femke Toos, the
Dutch nurse. Still wearing her white uniform dress she�d been trussed up with
strips of cloth, torn I guessed from clothes found in the caravan. Her mouth
was well stuffed with a cloth gag. She�d lost her cap in her struggles and it
lay on the floor near her feet, but that was all she had managed to dislodge. I
reached forward and pulled off the identity badge that she wore pinned to her
dress, �Ward Nurse : F Toos,�
it said. Well, she was going to be working in some different wards from now on.


&nbsp;

�It was soooo easy,� Tricia crowed.
�Snatched her when she got back to the �van. Stuffed her in there. Eva hitched the caravan up to our
truck and we were off the site and on our way in 15 minutes. How easy was that?
Nobody was bothered, caravans come and go all the
time.�� 

&nbsp;

Tricia grabbed hold of Greetje and
pulled her from beneath the couch. Eva untied the cloth strips from Femke�s ankles and got her to her feet. The two captives
were led away to be introduced to Rick.s team and
their new, albeit temporary, accommodation. 

&nbsp;

Freddie was up at the Prep Centre for one of his occasional
visits. I guessed he�d been giving folk a little �encouragement� and getting
his ear closer to the ground than had been the case for a while. He called me
up to asked me for an update on the current projects. I assumed he�d want to
hear about Rachel too.

&nbsp;

I found him in one of the offices, evidently talking on the
phone to Elly. �Yes, that should be fine,� he was
saying. �You know I trust your call on the legal stuff. No, I�m not worried
about any of the clauses they�ve added to the contract except for the suggested
warranties. We can�t warrant the stock for anything more than its current
status. I�m certainly not getting into �freedom from disease or any significant
medical condition that might prevent the goods from providing the specified
services or might reduce the value of the goods on re-sale�. That�s a
mine-field. I�ll happily agree to confirming that no
medical condition has arisen during the period of acquisition, preparation and
orientation but we can�t be responsible for pre-existing medical conditions. Jeeze, they�ll be wanting me to send Harry out with an MRI
scanner.� He waved me to a seat. �And I don�t want a buy back clause either or
if we have one then it�s got to be �current market prices� not �purchaser�s
acquisition price�. I don�t care if they�re complaining that they don�t know
what the market will do; neither do I.� �
That OK? �. Fine. �..You�re a
star. �. Talk to you soon.� He put the phone down.

&nbsp;

�Hi, Freddie,� I said. �Contract problems?�

&nbsp;

�No, not really. Nothing
out of the unusual. Some of the buyers are always trying it on. The
bigger ones are starting to get purchasing managers in their organisation for
crying out loud. They don�t think they�ve added any value if they haven�t
changed at least one clause in the contract. Elly
will sort it out. It�s just noise, really.�

&nbsp;

�Maybe they don�t understand the process,� I said. Perhaps
we should give them some hospitality to help them see what a great product we
provide. We could do it somewhere nice and comfortable � use the Emir�s castle
maybe � let them have the experience their companies are buying into. They
probably don�t get much in the way of perks. We could do it as a training
exercise for them � giving them insights into the
problems of slave keeping so that they can negotiate better acquisition
contracts.�

&nbsp;

�Not a bad idea, Larry, old man, not a bad idea,� said
Freddie. �It�d certainly help to get them on-side and it might make them a
little more comfortable with dealing with us.�

&nbsp;

�And, when we quibble over a clause, they�d know why we were
doing it.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, I see your point. Let�s think about it in a bit more
detail. Anyway, that�s something new to worry about. I wanted to get an update
on the current stuff.���� 

&nbsp;

I gave Freddie an update on the current state of the
Kushtian activities including the Emir�s purchases. I�d exchanged a number of
documents with the Trade Minister and we now had a frame contract that
everyone, even Elly, was happy with. The Trade
Minister was working with the Council and other government departments to get
together a consolidated list of likely requirements and we were due to discuss
how we might help build the market for imported product outside the government
as well. Freddie seemed pretty pleased.

&nbsp;

He asked about the Steve Glennis
project. I had to admit it was taking longer than I�d hoped. We�d identified
the target � Lady Marchmont � and Steve was happy
with that. Research had been working on a collection proposal but it was
proving a challenge to put together something that looked as though it would
work. Steve had been being quite patient, he felt it was better to take the
time and get it right. The urgency had gone out of it from his side and he�d
really been taken with the pictures we provided, especially some of the covert
video footage. We�d managed to get that from one of the paparazzi that had been
caught filming her with one of a string of boyfriends during a holiday in Mustique. He�d had seven kinds of shit kicked out of him which had left him in no doubt that he couldn�t publish it
but he was happy to cut his losses and let us have it at a price.� 

&nbsp;

We talked about the market research report. Freddie seemed
happy for me to carry on exploring new market opportunities.� He was still thinking what to do about the
sales activities now that Brian wasn�t around. Luckily he wasn�t thinking about
pointing them at me. I had enough to worry about.

&nbsp;

I told him about Kelly. He had a good laugh at the bit about
the gun�s safety catch. �I told Harry you weren�t safe to be allowed out,� he
chuckled. I didn�t really try to get introduce the idea of trying to establish
a �force-free� slave line based on recruiting willing slaves. I thought Freddie
had enough on his plate at the moment without more good ideas for new things to
do. And I knew that if I wanted to get very far with that argument I�d need a
lot more solid evidence. Even then it might not be enough. 

&nbsp;

We finished up talking about Rachel. I said I had the first
step set up for the following day. He said, �Good, let�s hope it works,� with
one of his most worrying smiles. �Oh,� he said, �by the way I�ve drawn a line
under the whole Brian business, I mean his family will still finish their
programme � that all seems to be working well � but I�ve pulled him out of it.
It just wasn�t fair on him. And it wasn�t doing me any good either.�

&nbsp;

I didn�t really know what to say. �And next?� seemed about
the only question to ask.

&nbsp;

�I don�t know,� said Freddie with a sigh that indicated he
really was letting go of the whole thing. �I just asked Elly
to sort it out. She�s good at that sort of thing. No loose ends with any of his
associates, no mess. It�ll be all right. I can rely on Elly.�

&nbsp;

I suddenly realised that when Clegg said �sort it out� he
wasn�t simply talking of Brian getting a new career direction, unless you
include in that playing a major supporting role in some local construction
project. 

&nbsp;

I wasn't sure which I found more disturbing; the obsessive
vengefulness that he had shown before or the disinterest in what presumably
would be Brian's violent demise that he was showing now. I just knew that I
didn't want to be on the receiving end of either.

&nbsp;

Chapter 47 : Crash Team

&nbsp;

Anaphylactic shock is a terrifying condition. The symptoms
are extreme. The onset is rapid. The outcome can be fatal.

&nbsp;

The Doc and I had planned the scenario carefully. She dosed
Rachel�s meal with the cocktail of drugs that she�d calculated would replicate
the symptoms while I distracted the guard that was about to take it in to her.
We wanted his response to be genuine.

&nbsp;

The symptoms started to appear very shortly after she
started eating. The guard hit the panic button when it became obvious that she
was having a problem. I arrived with the Doc to find her clutching at her
throat with one hand and her belly with the other. The Doc took her pulse.
�It�s racing like anything,� she said.�
Rachel was coughing saying she couldn�t swallow, that she had cramping pains
in her stomach, that she was finding it hard to
breath. She lost control of her bowels. She was groaning in a mixture of pain
and terror, staring wildly around her trying to understand what was happening
to her. 

&nbsp;

�Help me, I�m dieing,� she gasped. �It�s all going � awwkkgh � so black. I can�t�..�

&nbsp;

The Doc turned to the guard. �Get my bag,� she said,
�Quickly! It�s in my office.�

&nbsp;

�I�m not supposed to leave her,� he said.

&nbsp;

�Do it, or you�ll have to explain
to Clegg why we�ve lost her,� she barked. Sheepishly the guard padded off.

&nbsp;

�What do you think�s happening?� I
said.

&nbsp;

�It looks like anaphylactic shock,� the Doc said. �I need to
give her adrenalin.� Rachel was clutching at the Doctors arm, choking and
looking wild eyed in terror.

&nbsp;

Rachel passed out before the Guard got back. The Doc grabbed
her bag and grabbed a hypodermic, using it to administer supposedly, adrenalin,
actually a glucose solution that would do no further harm. But then neither the
Guard nor Rachel knew that the effect of the drugs would wear off quite quickly
anyway.

&nbsp;

She recovered in the Prep Centre�s clinic, laying on a bed, a glucose drip in her arm, an oxygen mask
over her mouth and nose and with me holding her hand.

&nbsp;

She peered weakly at me. Muttering from behind the oxygen
mask, �Whha� what happened? Where am I?�

&nbsp;

�Shh,� I said, �don�t try to talk.
You�ve had a bad attack. The Doctor will be here in a minute.�

&nbsp;

She pulled her hand away from me. �Why are you here?� I
didn�t try to take it back.

&nbsp;

�I was worried about you, Rachel.� That at least was true.
I�d really been concerned that she was going to die even though I�d known that
it wasn�t likely. I guess I hadn�t wanted the horse to die so soon in the
exercise. �But rest now. I�m sure you�ll be all right.�

&nbsp;

The Doc appeared. �Ah, she�s recovered consciousness,� she said.
�How are you feeling?�

&nbsp;

�Weak,� said Rachel, quietly. �But the pains have gone, I
can breath again.�

&nbsp;

�The adrenalin worked.�

&nbsp;

�Why? What was it? I thought I was going to die?�

&nbsp;

�You might very well have done. I shan�t know for certain
until I get the results of the blood tests but it looks like an anaphylactic
episode. Are you allergic to anything? Nuts for example?�

&nbsp;

�Nuh, no, I don�t think so.�

&nbsp;

�It�s just that it�s a common cause of this sort of
reaction. But yes, you could have died. Anaphylactic shock can kill. Extremely low blood pressure, breathing failure. They can be
fatal.�

&nbsp;

Rachel tried to lift herself up, but fell weakly back. �I�m
not tied or chained,� she said.

&nbsp;

�No,� said the Doctor. �But you�ll feel too weak to go
anywhere. Just rest for now. Get your strength back.� 

&nbsp;

She still had her collar on, of course. She wouldn�t be
going anywhere even if she did feel able to but it suited us for her to feel
that she was being trusted. �I�ll let you rest Rachel,� I said. �Don�t worry
about anything, I�ll see you later.�

&nbsp;

I looked in on the medical centre later. She was asleep. The
Doc had given her a mild sedative. She�d been happy to have it administered. It
was the first time she hadn�t fought us about something.

&nbsp;

The following morning she was sitting up in bed, wearing a
white patient�s robe and looking a whole lot perkier. She still had a drip in
her arm. She was hooked up to a blinking and beeping ECG machine. What she
didn�t know was that the readings weren�t always real. It�s surprising how ill
you can suddenly feel if a machine tells you your heart rate has risen and your
blood pressure has dropped.

&nbsp;

�How are you, Rachel?� I asked. 

&nbsp;

The Doc appeared. �She�s still weak,� she said. �Aren�t you
dear?� Rachel nodded. �So don�t spend too long with her.�

&nbsp;

�Thank you,� she said, quietly, dropping her eyes, �for
saving me.�

&nbsp;

�It was the Doc,� I said. �It was lucky she was there. I
couldn�t have done anything.�

&nbsp;

�I didn�t think anyone cared,� she went on. �I thought you
all just wanted the meat, just whatever you could get, whenever you wanted it.�

&nbsp;

�We just want you to get well, Rachel. That�s all.�

&nbsp;

�What happens? When I�m well?�

&nbsp;

�That just depends on you Rachel. You write the script for
your life, even here. Wait till you�re a bit stronger. Until that,� I pointed
to the now wildly fluctuating ECG scan. Rachel looked at it, frightened again,
�until that gets a whole lot more regular.�
Then we�ll set things up so you can be more comfortable. Sukie can look after you.� I�d made a good call with that
idea, Rachel gave a weak smile.

&nbsp;

I left Rachel and spoke to the Doc. �How soon can she come
out of here?�

&nbsp;

�For real? Right now,� she replied.
�For what you need? Leave it a couple of days.� 

&nbsp;

I did. The set up we�d organised was to convert one of the
visitor suites into a flat for me. Sukie had been
installed, happy to be out of the cells and pleased to be with me. I�d told her
she�d be helping with Rachel�s recovery. She seemed happy. They�d got on well
before when Rachel had been recording her experiences. The Doc brought Rachel
down in a wheel chair � she was still weak but that was as much due to her own
fear as to any drugs that had been used on her. She had her own bedroom in the
suite. Sukie helped her into bed. She fell asleep
almost at once.

&nbsp;

I left Sukie and Rachel together.
The suite had three bedrooms, a living area, bathroom and kitchen / dining
area. It was ranged around a small grassed, garden area with a couple of trees.
The two girls both had normal clothes to wear. They could pretty much do as
they pleased in the suite, apart from the fact that they both still wore their
collars.� 

&nbsp;

I had plenty of work to do. It wasn�t until the evening that
I got back to the suite. Rachel was sitting up in bed, Sukie
was brushing her hair. Sukie smiled welcomingly as I
appeared. Rachel managed a smile as well.

&nbsp;

�Hello,� I said. �How are you Rachel?�

&nbsp;

�Better,� she said. �Not well, but better.�

&nbsp;

�She has had some tea, Sir,� said Sukie.

&nbsp;

�Good,� I said. �But please don�t call me, Sir. Larry is
fine, in here.� Sukie looked grateful.

&nbsp;

Rachel looked up at me and suddenly burst into tears. She
clutched at Sukie who held her closely. �I�m so
scared. What if it happens again? The Doctor still doesn�t know what caused it
I don�t want to die. Not like that. It won�t happen again. Will it?�

&nbsp;

�Shh, shh,�
said Sukie cradling Rachel against her.

&nbsp;

�Who knows, Rachel,� I said, trying to be sympathetic but
also honest. �We all have to die.�

&nbsp;

�But like that? No, it�s too horrible.�

&nbsp;

�Worse than living here?�

&nbsp;

�Worse than living like this,� she said smiling at Sukie. She put her arms around her and hugged her back.

&nbsp;

�I don�t know,� I said, �it could have been some effect of a
combination of drugs, I suppose. It might not happen again if we can keep you
off them.� At least in that I was being honest. �Don�t worry about it happening
again, we�ll keep you well.� She looked up at me. I could tell she wanted to
believe me.

&nbsp;

�You�ve been working hard,� said Sukie
to me. �Can I get you some food? Rachel will be all right for a while.� I
looked across at Rachel. She nodded.

&nbsp;

�Yes, Sukie,� I said. �I�d like
that.�

&nbsp;

�And perhaps later I should come to your room?� Sukie said. Rachel was clearly startled by her directness. 

&nbsp;

�That would be nice, Sukie,� I
said, �but I want you to worry about Rachel at the moment. Fix me something to
eat and then look after Rachel for the evening. I have some more work to do
anyway.� I don�t normally turn down gift horses, I thought, but if I was going
to get the other horse to talk, that was the right move. Rachel even looked a
little impressed.�

Chapter 48 : The Write Stuff 

&nbsp;

It took about a week. Rachel was getting stronger by the
day. We put some gym equipment into the suite so she could exercise. Sukie was doing a good job of caring for her and I had to admit
that I�d been enjoying having the two of them to come back to at the end of the
day.

&nbsp;

I came back in and Rachel and Sukie
were playing chess, Tommy Smith�s recording of Eric Satie�s
Gymnop�die
was playing on the CD player.� The two of
them looked up at me as I dropped my papers on the table. Rachel waved. Sukie got to her feet.

&nbsp;

�How�s the game,� I asked looking at the board.

&nbsp;

�Rachel is winning,� said Sukie.
Rachel looked surprised. I looked down at the pieces. 

&nbsp;

I could see what she had to do. �Sometimes you have to
sacrifice something to get what you want,� I said, looking at the position of
Rachel�s queen. Rachel looked again at the board and then, finally, moved her
queen. Sukie, her own king now in check had no choice
but to take it. Her capturing knight now lay vulnerable to Rachel�s bishop. It
swept across the board to remove the knight.�


&nbsp;

�Check mate,� laughed Rachel, clapping her hands. Sukie smiled to Rachel and then smiled in turn at me.
Rachel pushed the board away from herself. �You�re right,� she said. �sometimes you do have to sacrifice things.� She turned
towards me. �I feel things have started again. Since the
attack. It might happen again but it might not. Either way I am here
now. I have left a lot behind me. I have to find where I go next, from here,
not from somewhere else. Maybe that needs acceptance. Maybe that needs
sacrifice.�

&nbsp;

�Maybe,� I said, watching her.

&nbsp;

�Sukie tells me you saved her
too.� Sukie looked embarrassed as she went to clear
away the chess pieces and the board.

&nbsp;

�No. No, I didn�t save her. She saves herself. I gave her a
new place in which to try.�

&nbsp;

�I want to save myself too. I have a new place too, since
the attack.�

&nbsp;

�Can you accept things the way that Sukie
does? You have the strength I am sure but can you do it?�

&nbsp;

Rachel looked thoughtful. �I�m not sure,� she said, �but I
want to try. Do what you want with me. I�ll learn acceptance. I�ll make myself
for the life I have to lead here. I�ll write for you.� 

&nbsp;

�I want to believe you, Rachel. I�m sure you can make
yourself. You just need to follow your own script. Can you write it?�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� she said. �I am writing it already,� she tapped the
side of her head. �In here.�

&nbsp;

�I could get you a laptop. It would be easier.� 

&nbsp;

Rachel smiled. �Later,� she said. �Come to bed, now. With Sukie and me. Now. It�s in script.�

&nbsp;

Sukie was standing at the door to
the bedroom. They had obviously discussed this already. She was grinning
widely, pleased that, at last, she and I would be together again. We took
ourselves to bed for over three hours. At one point Rachel was kneeling with
her wrists bound, fellating me while Sukie knelt across me, her tiny nipples pressed against my
face. At another Rachel tied Sukie�s wrists, giving
head to her while I stroked the two girls. All three of us, panted and grunted
our way through orgasm after orgasm. (Well they did at least, I�m no athlete.
But they didn�t let the fact that I had spent myself prevent them continuing to
enjoy themselves, taking amusement in my exhaustion while they pleasured one
another.)

&nbsp;

Rachel and I were still together in bed the following
morning. She still wearing nothing apart from her collar and the silken cords
that she and Sukie had used in bondage play looped
loosely around her wrists.

&nbsp;

Sukie appeared at the door to the bedroom, naked and carrying a
breakfast tray for the three of us.�
She sat on the bed beside us. The three of us devoured the figs, honey
yoghurt, rolls, orange juice and coffee.

&nbsp;

Rachel sat up, putting her hand on my thigh. �I meant it,�
she said. �I�ll do what you want. I�ll write for you.�

&nbsp;

�I know you mean it,� I said. �I believe you want to. I have
a job for you. There is a group of four women going through a new form of
orientation. Go and talk to them. Write about them,
understand what has been done to them. I want to understand how they feel. You
may think it�s brutal. Can you do it?�

&nbsp;

She gave me a look of firm resolve. �Yes,� she said, �I
can.�

&nbsp;

�You�ll have to be chained outside of here,� I said.

&nbsp;

She looked shocked for a moment but then smiled. �Of
course,� she said. �I should have realised. That�s all right. I understand.�

&nbsp;

I breathed a sigh of relief internally. At least she had
crossed that hurdle of acceptance. I made a few phone calls. After a few
minutes a guard appeared with a set of shackles and a laptop to escort Rachel.
She went with him willingly.

&nbsp;

I�d always meant for Rachel to be exposed to the sexualisation of Brian�s family at some point in the
process and it seemed like now would be as good a time as any. The idea was to
give Rachel the opportunity to demonstrate her resolve both to me and to
herself and to see that she could confront what the organisation did. 

&nbsp;

I stopped by at one point to watch her through the one way
mirrors that looked into the rooms that Brian�s family occupied. The light in
the rooms was bright, the colours vivid. Beth and Ella were showing Rachel a
range of sex toys, all in bright, primary colours with soft rounded edges. Beth
lifted up her short pale green smock exposing her naked breasts and allowing
Rachel to experiment with one of the vibrators on her nipples. She laughed as
the tickling sensation brought her the pleasure she craved. The two girls drew
Rachel to one side showing her Alice
as she applied body paint to Carol�s naked flesh. The swirling psychedelic
patterns recalled those I�d seen on old �60�s album covers. Carol was smiling
happily as Alice drew the brush
across her back making a curving line from the nape of her neck to the base of
her spine. She reached out for a handful of soft berries from a bowl of fruit
near her head, cramming some into her mouth, the red berry juice trickling down
her chin, before beckoning to Beth, Ella and Rachel in turn to feed each of
them some of the fruit. Alice stood
up. Carol had obviously been practicing her own artistic skills on her sister
with an elaborate paisley patterned design across her belly stretching up to
between her breasts. It was only as I stood there looking at it that I realised
it was an abstract rendering of a vulva, rays of light shining out from the
clitoris, beneath it a colourful, patterned penis stretching up towards it. Alice
walked across to the pile of toys and picked up an acid pink, soft plastic, dildo. She started to lick and suck at it. As she did so it
was obvious that the vibration in her thong kicked in to reward her compliant
behaviour as she smiled and clutched at her crotch, sliding back on the couch
in ecstasy.� 

&nbsp;

When Rachel returned that evening it was clear that she had
had done more than just confront what the organisation was doing. She had been
fired up by what she had seen.

&nbsp;

�Do you want to talk, Rachel?� I asked.

&nbsp;

She shook her head. �No, I want to write. I really want to
write. I�ll use my room. Why don�t you and Sukie enjoy
yourselves for the evening. I really need to write.�
Her eyes were flashing with eagerness, her cheeks flushed. She scurried into
her room, clutching her laptop to her.

&nbsp;

Sukie emerged from the kitchen.
She saw Rachel disappear. �She is better?�

&nbsp;

�I don�t know,� I said. �She seems to have found a new way
forward. We�ll have to see,�

&nbsp;

�You�re worried about her,� Sukie
said. �I can see. And it�s about her, isn�t it? Not just what she means to the
business or what that means to you?�

&nbsp;

I nodded. As always, Sukie,
managed to see inside what was going on. 

&nbsp;

�You won�t send me away will you? If she
is well?�

&nbsp;

�No, Sukie, I won�t do that,� I
said reassuringly. Although I wasn�t sure how I could justify hanging on to her
at the end of the project, I didn�t think I could betray her like that after
all she had done.

&nbsp;

She smiled, grateful. �Come,� she said. �I�ll make some
food. Rachel will be busy for hours. You need something to take your mind off
your worries.�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� I said. �I�ll let you win at backgammon again if you
like.�

&nbsp;

�Let me win!� Sukie laughed. �I
suppose the slave must let her keeper retain his illusions.�

&nbsp;

�Of course,� I said. 

Chapter 49 : Rachel�s Report

&nbsp;

Rachel worked on her report for all that evening. She slept
by her laptop. I heard her working at it at various times through the night.
When I got up to leave the suite for a meeting with Harry, she was fast asleep
across the keyboard of the computer.

&nbsp;

I had to put up with quite a bit of teasing from Harry and
the others over my personal harem as Rick had called it. �You�ll be off to
Kushtia next,� he�d said. �What with Tricia, those two and
that Kelly girl. I don�t know how you have the energy.�

&nbsp;

The truth was I didn�t have the energy. I hadn�t seen much of
Tricia or Kelly. Tricia had been a bit pissed off when I told her I was moving
into the flat with Rachel and Sukie, which I guess
was understandable. The project for Rachel was soaking up all of my time. I
certainly hadn�t got time to go off playing kinky games with Kelly. As Freddie
had said, I didn�t want pressing any harder on this one.�� 

&nbsp;

When I got back to the suite, Rachel and Sukie
were waiting for me. It wasn�t surprising, really; they couldn�t leave after
all. What was surprising was Rachel�s appearance. She�d made up her face and
done her hair (actually I reckoned that Sukie had
helped with that). She was wearing a very short skirt and a very tight, low cut
top that left her arms and midriff bare. She had put on the manacles that were
used when she needed to leave the suite. She was holding a folder, which I
guessed was her report. Sukie stood beside her holding a leash that ran to Rachel�s collar.

&nbsp;

I sat down at the table. Somehow I felt I should let Sukie or Rachel make the first move. Sukie
led Rachel towards the table.

&nbsp;

�The slave Rachel wishes to speak, Sir,� Sukie
said.

&nbsp;

I felt that the situation demanded formality and a firm
tone. She wouldn�t need questions now. Maybe that could come later. �Approach
slave,� I said, beckoning to her and noticing that she seemed pleased by being
addressed that way. �Say what you have to.���


&nbsp;

�I have completed my report, Sir,� Rachel said, putting the
folder on the table. �Can I talk to you about it?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, of course, slave. What is it?� I was concerned in case
she had found the programme too close to her own experiences of rape.

&nbsp;

�I�ll explain about it in a moment but there�s something
else I have too say. I want to undergo the programme. Myself. I�ll do it
willingly. This is my script. I want to do this and write for you. They were so
alive; so untroubled by anything apart from pleasure; so lost in their desire
to please. It�s what my life should be; about pleasure and pleasing.�

&nbsp;

�And you understand what is involved?� 

&nbsp;

�You will see that if you read the report. I think you�ll
find it thorough.�

&nbsp;

�I�m sure it is Rachel,� I said.� 

&nbsp;

�It�s in my script,� she said firmly. �But you own me. You
saved me.� She dropped to her knees. �You can say if I may follow my script.�

&nbsp;

I put out my hand and brought her to her feet. �Of course,
Rachel,� I said. She smiled. �Let me talk to the team tomorrow.� She looked
sad. �We cannot do it now. I have to be sure that you are properly cared for. I
don�t want the risk of you being hurt again.� She smiled again with relief, grateful
that I wasn�t simply trying to postpone things. Nothing could have been further
from my mind. I looked across at Sukie. She nodded.
Her judgement was important to me. I wanted things to turn out right for
Rachel, I wasn�t sure she knew what was best for herself yet, but I trusted Sukie to understand. Rachel hugged me as best she could
with her wrists in chains.

&nbsp;

�Now, Sir,� said Rachel making a visible effort to contain
herself, �would you like to hear the report or perhaps you might like to take
pleasure in my body.� 

&nbsp;

I took her by the arm and pulled her down to site beside me.
�The report for now,� I said. �Perhaps Sukie can fix
us some food.� Rachel looked disappointed. �And then perhaps we can all play
later.� She brightened up. Sukie bowed, smiled
happily, and headed off to the kitchen.

&nbsp;

Rachel picked up the file and began pointing out the
important parts of her report. �Here�s the account of the process,� she said
barely pausing for breath as she hopped backwards and forwards through the
folder. �I understand that you saw something of the initial stimulation
programme. There�s a summary of the normalised environment and the technology
that they have used for the thong and the women�s reactions to it. They�ve
managed to do some psychological profiles of each of the women now and I�ve
summarised those. And here is a table showing the results of the progressive
reduction in time from initial stimulation to orgasm as they have each
progressed through the programme. I spoke to the two girls first. They were
both quite inexperienced sexually so it was an interesting exercise to contrast
their reactions to that of their mother and their aunt. It was so useful to
have family members like that. Here�s how they felt about things like the toys
and the free expression, music, art, colour and sensations of touch and taste
and smell, And here�s the accounts of their first
sexual encounters following the completion of the programme and their reaction
to varying frequencies of stimulation from the thong. I�ve put in an account
from each of them on how they felt initially and their attitudes at the
completion of the programme. What was also fascinating was the reaction of the
men that they had been with. I managed to get details from some of them as
well. They describe the performance of the women as extremely satisfying, far
improved over rape � unless of course forced sex was being specifically sought
� and better than most sexual encounters in almost every case. Only those in
committed relationships felt that their encounters with the subjects did not
fully measure up to those with their own partners and even then there are some
thoughts that where a commitment already exists that the programme could
reinforce it.� She looked shyly at me. �I�m sorry, Sir,� she said. �I�m talking
too much.�

&nbsp;

�Not at all, slave,� I said. She sat up with pride at the
use of the term. �You�re just following your script.�

&nbsp;

�You�re making fun of me,� she said, accusingly.

&nbsp;

�No, not at all. I�m glad you found
this in yourself. You can be safe now.�

&nbsp;

�I know,� she said. �I have to lose something in order to
gain other things. I�m ready to do this.�

&nbsp;

And she was. I was able to get her started on the programme
the following day. She�d spend the day relaxing with Sukie
to prepare herself. The programme proper would start in the evening. That gave
me time to go with Harry for a further meeting with the Emir. We had to deliver
the first part of his shipment.��������

Chapter 50 :
New Homes

&nbsp;

The Emir had been very specific. He had
wanted his new property delivered without any �preparation� as he called it. �I
know you have a very good Centre, Larry my friend, but I was always told a
Kushtian teaches their own, so I�ll do it that way if you don�t mind.� Well, of
course we didn�t mind. It was a whole lot less effort for us that way, all we
had to do was to pack and ship. Harry and I took the van up to the Emir�s new
home. We were keen to see whether he wanted to take delivery of Sarah as well.
We�d got the first six of his fourteen items all wrapped up cosy in the back
and we planned to be back in the Prep Centre that afternoon.

&nbsp;

It wasn�t to be quite as straightforward as
we�d hoped.

&nbsp;

The main problem was that when we turned up
at the Emir�s place he wasn�t home. Who was home was his daughter.

&nbsp;

One of the Emir�s heavies opened the door.
Verbal communication didn�t seem to be his strong point but we managed to make
him understand that there were ten items in the back that needed moving across
to the castle keep accommodation. He grunted to indicate that he�d do something
about it. One of his pals emerged from a room off the lobby to help. The two of
them began to unload the van, wheeling each of the girls off on her own self contained
pallet. Lauren, the Emir�s 19 year old daughter, swept into view. She was quite
small, maybe only five feet two or three tall, but her voice was loud enough to
crack a glass. 

&nbsp;

�Hey, what�s this?� she called. �Looks like
the curse of the mummy�s tomb!� She wasn�t far wrong with each of the girls
wrapped tightly in the white tape that kept them strapped to their boards. �Dad
said you�d be dropping these off. He�s not back yet. You�d better come
through.� She gestured through towards the lounge. �I hope that this lot end up
being more use than the one you left him.�

&nbsp;

I looked at Harry. That wasn�t the reaction
we�d expected. She wasn�t really trained as a domestic slave but we�d thought
that Sarah would have been all right here. We followed the Emir�s daughter into
the lounge. She flopped down on one of the enormous couches. 

&nbsp;

Sarah was standing at the far end of the
lounge. The pillory had been brought up from the dungeon and Sarah was locked
helplessly in it. �I need to keep an eye on this one,� Lauren said. Poor Sarah
was bent forward with her head sticking through the central hole of the
pillory, her wrists trapped in the holes to either side. In her left hand she
held a heavy leather paddle, in her right a many tailed flogger, in her mouth a
riding crop. �That�s the only way she�s gonna learn, stupid bitch,� Lauren said
with a determined look. I walked across to her, she was dressed in a bikini but
instead of her pants she had been locked into a chastity belt. One metal band
bit tightly into her waist, another stretched down from the middle of her
back� between her buttocks over covering
her sex with a pierced metal plate and then running up to be padlocked to the
waist band at the front. It was clearly uncomfortable, red sores could be seen
on the inside of Sarah�s thighs where the belt had rubbed.

&nbsp;

Her backside was criss-crossed with wheals
from a vicious beating. She turned her head towards me with a pleading look in
her eyes but kept silent, unable to speak, fearful of dropping the crop from
between her lips.

&nbsp;

�Do you know how I found her when I got
here?� Lauren said, �sprawled by the pool with one of these stoopid guards
waiting on her. Sure she had shackles on her but the guard looked like he�d
been having a really good blow job, and she was lounging around like she owned
the place. Jeez! Tried to kid me that the guards had been taking advantage of
her. She had a day in the scold�s bridle for that. It�s obvious what the little
slut was up to. She�s been finding out what slaves are for since I turned up,
haven�t you my dear?� Sarah nodded slowly. �The chastity belt is to make sure
she behaves. The crops and floggers are to remind her what happens when she
doesn�t.

&nbsp;

Harry was looking for an opportunity to get
Sarah out of her predicament. �She should sort out the new slaves,� he said.
�Make sure they�re settled into their cells properly.�

&nbsp;

To my surprise Lauren looked thoughtful.
�Yeah, sure,� she said. �Dad will want them all ready to go when he gets back.
Here�s the key, you can let her out.� She tossed him a bunch of keys. Harry
caught them and unlocked Sarah from the pillory. �Go on, slut,� Lauren smiled,
waving Sarah off. �You heard the man. Make sure they�re sorted out and tell
them what to expect round here.� Sarah put down the flogger, crop and paddle
and shuffled off, her movements restricted by a short length of chain between
her ankles. Lauren watched her go. �Do you guys want a beer?� she said.

&nbsp;

�Shouldn�t we check she�s doing as she�s
told, after what you said?�

&nbsp;

�Nah, I�ll show you. Dad�s got all this
sorted.� She picked up the remote control for the TV. As the set came into life
she punched a button on the remote. The channel changed on the TV to show one
of the cells. �Neat � huh?� Lauren said.

&nbsp;

One of our captives had been laid on their
back on each of the bunks in the cell. They were still swathed in tape and the
wheels attached to the frame that they were bound to could be seen clearly at
their feet. We heard a click as the cell door opened and heard one of the
guards say. �Sing out when you�ve done. I�ll let you out then.� The still
shackled Sarah came into view. The door gave a clang as it was slammed behind
her.�� 

&nbsp;

�Oh my,� we heard Sarah say as she saw the
helpless forms laid out on the bunks of the cell. �You poor things, let me help
you out of that tape.� We watched as the tape cocoons that held the girls
squirmed in response to a friendly voice.

&nbsp;

Sarah started to free the girl in the bunk
nearest too her. As the tape came clear of the girl�s head we could see that it
was Greetje. With the swathes of tape removed from her head. The terrified look
in the girl�s eyes could be clearly seen. She tried to wriggle but with her
arms taped to her sides and her legs trapped one against the other she could do
little more than twitch. Sarah eased away the tape that covered Greetje�s mouth
and prised free the wad of cloth that had been gagging her. 

&nbsp;

�Oh, dank u,� the girl coughed, �thank
you.�

&nbsp;

�Hush,� said Sarah, �wait. I must free you
and your friends.� She went to work on the tape that held the girls limbs. Soon
it was lying in a heap on the floor of the cell and Greetje had managed to ease
herself up into a sitting position pushing the board that she had been strapped
to onto the floor.�� She looked around
her, taking in the solid stone walls, the barred window and the massive door.

&nbsp;

Sarah was working to free the second girl.
Greetje got uncertainly to her feet, steadying herself on the side of the bunk.
�Where are we? What has happened to us?�

&nbsp;

Femke was next to be freed from the tape.
She sat up shakily and turned to hug Greetje. Sarah went to work on the other
two girls. Talking over her shoulder to Greetje and Femke, she said, �You�ve
been kidnapped by slavers,� she said �and you are in the home of your new
owner. You�ll have to do exactly as you are told. These people are very cruel.
Don�t try to resist them.� We could see from the monitor that both girls were
clearly terrified.

&nbsp;

�But why would we be kidnapped? No-one
would pay a ransom for us; we have no rich family; we have no money.�

&nbsp;

�No, that�s not the point. It�s not for
money. You have been brought here for yourselves. It�s not for money. You have
been brought here for your bodies. You belong here. Just like this furniture.
You belong to the man that owns this bed. His bed. His table. His room. His
women. You will do whatever he tells you.�

&nbsp;

Greetje and Femke held each other in fear.
�It cannot be true.�

&nbsp;

Sarah pointed to the anklets and shackles
that lay on the chair beside the bed. �You must put those on,� she said. �We
all have to wear a collar or an anklet and chains.�

&nbsp;

�No,� said Femke, �we won�t. You can�t make
us.�

&nbsp;

�No,� said Sarah, �I can�t but there are
those that can. They�ll hurt you. Believe me. It�s better to do as they say.�
Greetje and Femke looked at one another and picked up the anklets. Sobbing, they
fitted them around their ankles, reacting in fear as they locked shut with a
menacing clunk.

&nbsp;

Back in the lounge, Lauren smirked.
�There,� she said, pointing at the television, �what good little girls. Dad
will be pleased. Anyway, excuse me. I have to use the can.� She got up and
flounced off.� 

&nbsp;

Harry and I just sat and looked at one
another. 

&nbsp;

Sarah returned having finished �welcoming�
the castle�s new residents. Lauren was still out of the room. Sarah turned to
the two of us. �Please,� she said, �please take me back.� 

&nbsp;

Harry smiled in response. �I don�t know,�
he said. �It sounds like you�ve not been very good.� He pointed to the chastity
belt.

&nbsp;

�I didn�t deserve this, really I didn�t. I
mean the Emir even told the Guards not take any liberties with me. I just was
getting so bored in my cell and they said I could use the pool and the gym if I
did it naked. Well I didn�t mind. And yes they groped me a bit and I didn�t
like that, but that was all.�

&nbsp;

Harry looked sceptical. �Come on Sarah, I
know what these guys are like. They�re no different from Rick�s team.

&nbsp;

�Well, all right. Yes I did give one of
them a blow job and, yes, he was getting me a coke when Lauren appeared but
that�s all there was to it. I don�t deserve this,� she tugged at the iron band
circling her waist. �Oh, no, she�s coming back.� Sarah picked up the paddle,
flogger and crop and put her head and wrists back in place in the pillory.

&nbsp;

Lauren drifted back into the room. She
looked at Sarah in the pillory and pushed its locking padlock closed. �Good,�
she said, �glad you�re learning where a slut belongs. Locked in there you won�t
go sniffing round the cocks of any of the guards will you? Just remember around
here you ain�t the original good time that was had by all.�� 

&nbsp;

She flopped down on the settee as her
father came in through the door. �Hi, princess,� he beamed. �Hope you�ve been
good.� 

&nbsp;

�Daddy, you know I always am,� Lauren
batted her eyelashes at her father in a way that must have earned his
indulgence since her earliest childhood.

&nbsp;

The Emir looked around at Sarah in the
pillory. �Lauren, I told you that Sarah was to be your babysitter, this doesn�t
look like how I said things should be.� He turned to Harry and me. �Yeah, I
know it seems odd but us Kushtians think a girl needs her father or an older
woman around until she�s married.� �

&nbsp;

Lauren looked sulky. �Daddy we�re not in
Kushtia now. I don�t need a babysitter and besides you should have seen what
she was up to.�

&nbsp;

The Emir looked on patiently. �I will
Lauren, I will. I�ll have a look at the videos later. Now let Sarah out of the
pillory and leave us boys to talk business.� 

&nbsp;

�Whatever,� said Lauren before unlocking
the pillory and walking off.

&nbsp;

The Emir lifted the top bar of the pillory
and helped Sarah out. He took the flogger, crop and paddle from her and put
them on a table. �I don�t know what you did to give her that opportunity,� he
said to Sarah, �but I guess that you�ve worked out that it wasn�t a great
idea.�

&nbsp;

Sarah looked apologetic but said nothing.
Brad turned back to us. �So you got all the girls I asked for?�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� said Harry. They�re all installed.�

&nbsp;

�Great. And what about this one?� He
reached out and patted Sarah�s arse. She looked pleadingly at Harry.

&nbsp;

Harry shook his head. �Sorry Brad,� we�ve
looked at it and we want to hang onto her for now at least. I�m sure we could
find you a new PA.�

&nbsp;

Brad looked disappointed. �Shame,� he said.
�I was just getting used to her being around. Kind of has the right look for
the place.�

&nbsp;

�It�s a shame you never met Cindy.� Sarah
had chimed in from the other side of the room. �She looks just like me, people
used to take us for sisters and�.� Her voice tailed off as she realised just
where what she was saying might lead.

&nbsp;

�Now that�s interesting,� said Brad.

&nbsp;

�Yes indeed,� responded Harry. �Tell us
more.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, no, I couldn�t, I mean, you wouldn�t.
That wouldn�t be fair. Not at all. No� Sarah was evidently worried. Harry and
Brad exchanged a look that suggested she had good cause to be.

&nbsp;

�Don�t be worried,� Brad said to her. �Go
and wait by the swimming pool. Harry, come and give me a hand with something.�
The two of them disappeared. Sarah and I made our way through the house to the
pool. All the way she was saying that she shouldn�t have said anything and she
couldn�t possibly be involved in anything to do with Cindy. She was so busy
protesting to me that she didn�t see what Brad and Harry were wheeling in along
the side of the pool. Dragged up from the dungeon, Brad�s replica of a ducking
stool was pushed into place. 

&nbsp;

�Please, Larry, speak to them. I shouldn�t
have said anything. I�m sure she doesn�t look like me really. And anyway it was
a while ago and .. Oh!� Sarah gave a startled cry as the edge of the stool
struck the back of her knees. She fell backwards and in a moment Harry and Brad
had fixed her into the seat, strapping her in with a belt around her waist and others
which held her wrists against the stool�s armrests. �No, please no!� Sarah
yelled as Harry and Brad swung the beam of the ducking stool out over the pool.

&nbsp;

�Now,� said Brad. �This implement only
dates back to around 1597 and then as a method of punishment for scolds,
prostitutes and witches. However, I suspect it could also have been used as a way
of enquiring into matters of interest to the authorities. Let�s see if it helps
us with our enquiries.� With that he let go of the beam and the stool with
Sarah on it plummeted into the pool. Harry and Brad held their end of the beam
up for a few moments, keeping Sarah submerged before they put their weight onto
it, hauling a spluttering Sarah back to the surface. �And again, I think,� said
Brad, levering the beam up and lowering a now screaming Sarah once more beneath
the waters. 

&nbsp;

She came up once more, kicking her legs and
trying to break away from the straps that held her in the stool. �Now, perhaps
you�d like to tell us more about Cindy,� Brad called from the pool side.

&nbsp;

�No, no, no, n --- ppllpll,� came Sarah�s
voice, first yelling and then burbling as she went under again. Four more duckings
followed, each longer than the last, Sarah yelling more loudly and coughing and
spluttering more violently on her return to the surface, her hair drenched and
hanging limply. 

&nbsp;

Harry called a halt to the proceedings.
�Good demonstration, Brad,� he said. �But I think we need a different approach.
Either that or colder water.� Brad looked pensive for a moment.

&nbsp;

Sarah was still kicking and complaining on
the stool. Brad swung her back over the side and un-strapped her. �Hey, he
said. �We didn�t mean no harm. You go and get yourself dried off.� He tossed a
towel to the shivering Sarah. �There�s a dress over there. Put it on and we�ll
get you a hot drink.� 

&nbsp;

While Sarah was dressing, Brad picked up
the pool side phone and muttered a few quiet words to whoever was at the other
end. As she finished dressing, Harry clipped a leash to her collar and scolded
her. �Really Sarah, you�re being very difficult.� 

&nbsp;

Brad, seemingly sympathetic said, �Hey
you�ve got to admire the girl�s principles. Not many girls would stand by their
friends like that.�

&nbsp;

Sarah brightened up. �Thank you,� she said,
I�m glad you understand.�

&nbsp;

�In fact, I�m so impressed that I�d just
like to tell the other girls about this. It will be good for them to see that a
slave doesn�t have to have her spirit completely crushed. Might make them
accept things a bit easier.�

�

She said nothing but followed us as Brad
led the way along one of the castle�s corridors.

&nbsp;

Chapter 51 :
What Are Friends For?

&nbsp;

The winding corridor eventually took us
along to the accommodation cells. As we walked by Sarah said, �Aren�t we going
to see the girls after all? I thought��

&nbsp;

�They�ve been moved,� said Brad. We turned
a corner. Coming the other way was one of Brad�s guards. Clad only in black
leather trousers and a leather hood that masked the upper half of his face, his
torso glistened with the sweat of recent effort. He and Brad exchanged a few
quiet words. The guard took the ring of keys that hung from a clasp on his belt
and passed them to Brad. We carried on as the guard pushed passed us. Sarah
watched fearfully as he went.

&nbsp;

The corridor carried on down into the
castle�s cellar and the room that the Emir had fitted out as a dungeon-come-torture
chamber. Sarah gave a startled, �Oh!� as she entered the room.

&nbsp;

What she saw was the six girls we had
delivered to the Emir, locked into one or other of the Emir�s medieval �toys�.
Femke was strapped to the heavy wooden rack, her arms and legs already stretched
to painful tautness. Peta was hanging by her wrists and ankles which were tied star
fashion to the rim of a great wooden wheel dangling from the ceiling of the
room. She was crying out as she tried to relieve her arm and leg muscles of the
strain of supporting her weight.� 

&nbsp;

Janice had been tied, naked, in a hogtie. She
hung by the ropes that ran around her chest so that her crotch was only
millimetres above a knife sharp block of wood that threatened to split her in
two if the rope supporting her should fail or be loosened. Karen sat alongside
her strapped into a heavy wooden chair with her head locked in a strange frame
that could be tightened by handle and ratchet. Similar boards designed to press
and crush on limbs enclosed her arms and thighs. �We�re missing one,� said
Brad. �Oh yes.� He pulled back a heavy oak box that was hanging from chains. It
was clear from his effort that the box and its contents were extremely heavy.
As he pulled it back a chained and helpless Jillie could be seen struggling,
tied to the frame beneath it. �Terrible thing if this should fall,� he said,
letting it swing back into place. Brad moved across to where Greetje was
standing in a human form cabinet. Naked, bound and gagged, her eyes wide with
terrified panic, she watched as Brad started to swing the door of the cabinet
closed. A grotesque skeleton was painted on the front of the cabinet door
providing a clear indication of the likely fate of the occupier. �This,� he
said, �was known as the Iron Maiden. There�s one in Nuremberg which as
you close the door pierces the occupant with spikes.� Greetje screamed behind
her gag. �This one�s a bit different; you can control the depth of the spikes
from the outside with this wheel. Of course it�s easy to get things wrong. Look
at these,� he pointed to two thick spikes in the head piece of the cabinet�s door.
�they�d pierce the eyes like cocktail sticks in olives.�� Greetje screamed again. �And Greetje here is
unlucky too. I hear she suffers from claustrophobia. Isn�t that right Harry?�

&nbsp;

�Mmm,� said Harry responding. �Yes, she was
in a terrible state when we got her out from behind the couch in the caravan
after we snatched her. She must be finding this awful.�

&nbsp;

�Well, yes. But still. Where was I?� He let
the door of the Iron Maiden slam shut absent-mindedly. Sarah gave a horrified
squeal. Greetje gave another gagged scream. �Oh yes,� Brad said to the helpless
girls. �Thought I�d introduce you girls to Sarah,� he said. �We sort of wanted
her to help us out with a problem but it seems like her principles won�t let
her. We can�t persuade her to change her mind. I�d planned to do some other
stuff this morning but now I�m feeling a bit upset and I�ll need you girls to
help cheer me up. I hadn�t really thought I�d put these toys to use but it
seems a shame to let them rust.� He grabbed Sarah. �Why don�t you sit down and
have a chat with the girls. I�m sure when you explain your point of view
they�ll be OK with it,� he said manoeuvring her to a set of stocks. He locked
her ankles in the stocks. �Now if you�re going to chat.� Brad walked across to
each of the girls in turn and pulled off the tape that gagged them. He opened
the Iron Maiden and peeled back the tape gagging Greetje. Immediately she
started yelling, hysterically, begging to be let free. �Oh, no,� said Brad,
�that won�t work.� He smoothed the tape back down and shut the door again.
Greetje�s muffled screams could still be heard from inside. �We�ll talk again
in a bit, Sarah,� he said. 

&nbsp;

�You can�t do this,� yelled Sarah as he got
to the door. �It�s, it�s, it�s unfair.�

&nbsp;

�Unfair!� the Emir almost exploded. �What
is unfair is slaves that won�t do as they�re told; slaves that think they can
hold out on their owners. Just you remember girl, a slave owner invests a lot
in his property he�s entitled to expect the slave keeps their part of the
bargain. We do the owning, you do the being owned. This is all your fault,
Sarah, you made the suggestion, now you�re backing out on it. Don�t talk to me
about unfair. You can solve the problem yourself. It�s all up to you.�

&nbsp;

We didn�t go far. The CCTV link in the next
room let us watch the proceedings. Femke, Jillie and Karen were pleading the
most convincingly. Janice was adding her own punctuation of groans as their own
discomfort increased. Peta could be heard moaning from beneath the box that
threatened to crush her. The whole conversation was punctuated by Greetje�s
stifled but progressively more panic stricken screams from within the case that
held her. Sarah was trying to defend herself.

&nbsp;

�I can�t betray my friend,� she tried to
explain. �How can I tell them where to find her? And it�s not my fault that the
Emir is doing this to you.�

&nbsp;

�We don�t care,� came back Femke. �Poor
Greetje, locked in that thing, do you think she cares? Of course it�s your
fault. If you hadn�t said anything he wouldn�t have thought of this. Who know
what they�ll do in the future? You said yourself they are ruthless. You have to
take care of the people closest to you and right now that�s us. Maybe they
won�t find her. Maybe she�ll escape them. We can�t escape this.�

&nbsp;

�I know. It�s horrible. I just don�t know
what to do.� Sarah tried to struggle against the steel bands that held her
ankles locked. 

&nbsp;

As she did so, the rope holding Janice
above the knife like wooden block creaked and she dropped a millimetre or two.
She squealed in terror as she felt the sharp rigidity of the block�s knife edge
brush against her crotch. �Nooo!� she screamed. �The rope will break. It will
split me in two.�� 

&nbsp;

Greetje screamed again within the Iron
Maiden setting off another round of sobbing and pleading

&nbsp;

Sarah lasted for about five minutes. Soon
she screaming to be freed, calling out that she�d do whatever we asked as long
as the girl�s didn�t suffer any more. 

&nbsp;

We freed a sobbing Sarah from the stocks
and took her back to the lounge. Lauren looked up as we came in. �Has she been
trying it on again?� she sneered. �I hope she hasn�t talked you into taking
that belt off her. She�ll be pushing the guards up against the wall in no time
if you have.� Sarah burst into tears again.

&nbsp;

�We�re taking her back with us,� Harry
said.

&nbsp;

�Like I care?� said Lauren.

&nbsp;

�There�ll be a replacement.�

&nbsp;

�Better send one that�s had her cunt
plugged then.�

&nbsp;

�Lauren!� interrupted Brad. �That�s enough.
Just go to your room.�

&nbsp;

�Whatever,� said a sullen Lauren as she
slunk off.

&nbsp;

�Grief,� said Brad, �she�s getting to be a
real pain. And it will get worse when she find out I�ve found a husband for her
and she goes back with him to Kushtia.� 

&nbsp;

�How come?�

&nbsp;

�Do you think she�s going to find it easy
to swap her trainers and baseball cap for harem slippers and a veil?�

&nbsp;

�Ah, I see what you mean,� I said. �Not to
mention the shackles.�

&nbsp;

�Yupp. But as the daughter of a Kushtian government
official she�ll have to and learn to like it. Still the problems of fatherhood,
eh? You�ll sort things out with your girl?� 

&nbsp;

�Yes,� said Harry, �once she�s says she�ll
do something she will. It may take us a while to set up the collection. It
depends on her circumstances. If there�s any problem I�ll give you a call.�

&nbsp;

Harry turned to Sarah. �Time to get you
back,� he said.

&nbsp;

�Where�s the gag?� she asked, grabbing it
gratefully as Harry held out the gell ball gag in his palm. You could almost
sense her relief as the gel swelled to fill her mouth. She held her wrists out
for the handcuffs and was happy to be led to the boot of our car. 

&nbsp;

We left it until the following day before
following up on the conversation at the castle. Sarah was back behind her desk
when I went to join Harry in his office.

&nbsp;

�Now,� said Harry, �let�s have a chat about
your friend Cindy.�

&nbsp;

�Oh,� said Sarah, looking crestfallen. She
had evidently hoped the whole thing had been forgotten. 

&nbsp;

�Tell us some more about her. I hope you
aren�t going to go back on your promise.�

&nbsp;

�No, no. I couldn�t let the Emir do what he
was doing. And poor Greetje. Will she be all right?�

&nbsp;

�I think that�s still a bit up to you. I
have to give the Emir a progress report tonight and I�m sure Greetje will be
fine if I can tell him we�ve got some activity in hand.�

&nbsp;

Sarah looked at first relieved and then
miserable. �What do you want to know?� she said.

&nbsp;

�Well let�s start with who she is and where
we might find her.�

&nbsp;

Sarah started hesitantly, �Her name�s Cindy
Bailey. Like I said she looks a lot like me. Really, a lot, same hair, same
build. We used to swap clothes sometimes. She�s two years older than me, people
thought she was my big sister. She used to live in the same town; she worked in
the next street we�d meet up for lunch some times.�

&nbsp;

�OK,� said Harry. �She used to live in the
same town, you say. Where is she now?�

&nbsp;

�I don�t know. We lost touch about a year
ago.� She saw Harry�s sceptical look. �It�s true. You know I wouldn�t lie. I
really haven�t seen her since then. I know her job was moving � she worked for
another car dealer � BMW it was - and they were closing their garage and building
a bigger one in the next town.� I thought Sarah looked tentative for a moment.
�Coventry it was. I guess she went there. We swapped emails a few times but
then, well, I got busy and she got busy. You know how it is.�

&nbsp;

�And what did she do?�

&nbsp;

�Just admin stuff like me. Booking cars in
for servicing, sending out invoices, that sort of thing.�

&nbsp;

Harry looked thoughtful, tapping his ruler
on his desk. �Hmm, that may be enough to go on. I�ll get Research to do some
work and we�ll see how far we get. Don�t think you�re off the hook though.
First thing you can do is to type up this discussion as a memo to Rick. Ask him
to do the initial research and work up a collection proposal. Better copy Larry
here to keep him in the picture. When we�ve got Rick�s response we�ll see how
you can help.�

&nbsp;

Sarah looked woeful as she picked up her
notebook and headed back to her desk.

Chapter 52 : Rachel�s Programme

&nbsp;

Rachel was laying on one of the couches
where I had first seen Brian�s family being treated under the electro
stimulation programme. She was sedated but conscious; she�d not objected when
the Doctor slipped the hypodermic needle into a vein in her arm. She�d asked if
Sukie could be with her for the start of the
programme. We�d agreed and Sukie was sitting beside her stroking her hair. Rachel looked calm. The Doc
lowered the gantry above her and took down each pair of wires in turn,
fastening them to the studs that had would carry the current across each
nipple, across her clitoris, her vulva and her anus. I could see that in spite
of the sedation Rachel was gripping Sukie�s hand tightly.

&nbsp;

�We�ll start now,� said the Doc. �Are you
ready?� Rachel gave the slightest nod. The Doc threw the switch and the
sequence started. Rachel gave an involuntary grunt as the first pulses began.
She gripped Sukie�s hand even harder at first but
then seemed to relax. Soon a quiet smile spread across her face. The Doc turned
to me. �We can leave her now,� she said. �There�ll be nothing more to do now
for two hours.�

&nbsp;

Sukie looked up at me. �Can I stay?� I looked at the Doc. She shrugged.

&nbsp;

�Yes,� I said. �I�d like that. Thank you.� Sukie smiled and turned back towards Rachel. The Doc and I
left the two of them in the room. I could hear the pulse generator humming
quietly as we walked out.

&nbsp;

�It�s been interesting,� the Doc said once
we were out of the room and away from Sukie�s
hearing. �I think what happened was that the mental trauma of the rapes and
mistreatment and her focus on using that as preventing her conditioning created
a sort of mental blockage. The drugs that we were using simply served to
reinforce that. It was only the effects of the staged anaphylactic episode that
allowed her to draw a line under that. As you say, it�s as if she�s been able
to give herself a whole new start.�

&nbsp;

�That doesn�t explain her willingness to
undergo this though, does it?�

&nbsp;

�No, not at all. I think that�s got to do more with her past before we took her in,
if I�m honest. I wonder how well she had been able to accept her sexuality
prior to us acquiring her. I think that she is basically highly sexed � all our
psychological profiling prior to the programme indicate
that her artistic drives are perhaps behind that. She�s highly emotionally
aware and highly physically sensitive as well. If she had been in an
environment where that had been suppressed its probable that there was
considerable internal conflict. Seeing what had been done with the other women
opened her eyes to a way she could reach what she suspected was in her already.
It�s curious. In some ways she�s absolving herself of responsibility by being
able to claim that her behaviour is the consequence of the programme but
equally she has taken the responsibility of putting herself into the programme.
It�s a bit of a paradox.�

�Well, I can agree that she�s quite highly
sexed,� I said thinking back to my recent encounter with her and Sukie.

&nbsp;

The Doc, gave an embarrassed, �Hmmph. Well she�s staying in the treatment centre tonight.
I want her to have at least four days on this part of the programme before
taking the risk of exposing her to any other outside stimuli. Then she�ll go
into her own normalised suite and start working with the thong.���� �

&nbsp;

�That�s OK, Doc,� I said, �I�m as keen as
you are for this to succeed. I don�t want to do anything to rock the boat. I�ve
got some other work to do. If there�s nothing I can do for Rachel now, I guess
I�ll get on. Let me know if there�s anything I should do.�

&nbsp;

�Sure,� said the Doc.

&nbsp;

I went back to my office and spent some
time going through Rachel�s report on Brian�s family and the programme. I could
see plenty of opportunities on the back of it, but then I guess you didn�t need
to be a marketing genius for that. �What
I did do was to write a memo to Freddie suggesting that we used them for the
hospitality event that I�d suggested for some of the buyers. Thought he�d think
it was a good idea for all sorts of reasons. 

&nbsp;

I went back to the suite when I�d finished.� One of the guards turned up escorting Sukie shortly after. �How is Rachel?� I asked. Sukie sank down on the couch, looking exhausted. �And how
are you?�

&nbsp;

Sukie looked up at me. �I�m. I�m all right.� She said hesitantly. �Rachel
is fine too. I�m sorry. I just found it very frightening. She�s so very brave
to do that.�

&nbsp;

�I know. But it�s important to her.�

&nbsp;

�I couldn�t do it,� Sukie
was almost sobbing. �I thought I could do almost anything to please my man but,
not, �. Not that.�

&nbsp;

�She�s doing it to please herself, Sukie. No-one else.�

&nbsp;

�You might believe that,� Sukie smiled. �You�re important to her, you know.�

&nbsp;

�I know. She�s important to me. And so are
you.� I sat down alongside her and took her in my arms. She was shaking.

&nbsp;

�I can�t take the programme,� said Sukie. �But I can please you. If you want
me to.�

&nbsp;

I could see that right then nothing was
more important to her. �I�d like that, Sukie,� I
said. I did and she did too. Afterwards we both fell asleep. When I awoke Sukie slept on. I fetched her breakfast. She was outraged
and we both laughed.

&nbsp;

�Will you sit with Rachel again today?� I
asked her.

&nbsp;

�If you want me to,� Sukie
said.

&nbsp;

�You find it difficult don�t you? I don�t
want to make you.�

&nbsp;

�I know. I will go but it is frightening. I
don�t know if she will be the same when she comes back. She was always sweet
and kind to me. Now perhaps she will feel jealous of me. Perhaps she will
forget about me. Perhaps she will ask you to get rid of me.�

&nbsp;

�I don�t think so Sukie.
And I don�t think I would listen if she did.� The girl brightened. �Look, let�s
go and see her together. You needn�t stay if you don�t want to. There�s no need
for you to be there. Unless you want to be.�

&nbsp;

�Thank you,� she said, smiled and got out
of bed to get showered and dressed.

&nbsp;

We found our way back to where Rachel had
been the day before. She was sitting, naked, on the side of the treatment
couch. She waved as she saw us coming into the room. 

&nbsp;

The Doc appeared. �I�m just restarting
things,� she said to us and then; �Lie down Rachel, please.� She picked up a
hypodermic syringe. �Sedative,� she said. Rachel nodded, acceptingly. �Less
than yesterday, though.� She nodded again. The Doc administered the injection.
Rachel gave a comfortable, �mmm� as the sedative
began to take effect. The Doc hooked up the wires and started the sequence of
low frequency stimuli once more.

&nbsp;

Rachel relaxed into it; mewing quietly,
sighing, muscles twitching in response as the sequence took control. Sukie threw her arms around me. I took her out.

&nbsp;

From what the Doc had said there was little
point in either Sukie or myself
being around after the first day. In spite of the lower level of sedation, the
cumulative effect of the continuous stimulation meant that Rachel was pretty
much lost in the programme apart from when she was sleeping � and she needed
the sleep to allow her body to rest.

&nbsp;

We both went to see her after she had been
in the normalised environment for a couple of days. She came rushing towards us
as soon as she saw us, flinging her arms around first Sukie
� that comforted her � and then me.� 

&nbsp;

Rachel was wearing one of the smock dresses
in a pale blue that went well with her dark hair and piercing blue eyes. It
hung from her neck collar, swaying loosely around her as she moved.

&nbsp;

�You�re looking well.� I said. She was. 

&nbsp;

�Mmm,� she said.
�I�m fine. Look it�s lovely here. See.� She waved
around the flat. It was brightly lit, with cheerful colours and white wood
furniture. �Let me show you. I�m going to write about it for you. So customers
will know how their girls will be treated. I think they will need to know.� Her
enthusiasm was infectious. Sukie was looking happier.


&nbsp;

�We can watch all the television we want.�
She picked up the remote and flicked through the channels. �Of course it�s all
quite sexy stuff,� she paused on a scene of two girls stroking and licking at
one another�s bodies, �but I like that. And there�s music.� I looked at a pile
of CD�s, on top of the pile was Marvin Gaye�s �Sexual
Healing�, there were plenty of other similar plays. �And magazines.� I picked
up one, it looked like the usual celebrity gossip
magazine on the cover but the pictures inside showed the rich and famous in
positions that would startle many of their fans. �Look,� she said gripping my
arm and pointing with a giggle to the magazine I was looking at. �Who�d have
thought she could do that???� She sank back on the couch. �It�s just lovely and
I feel so��

&nbsp;

She paused and put her hand up to the side
of her head. I saw she was wearing a small ear piece.

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry,� she said. �I must do my
exercises now. Will you excuse me? If I don�t .. they won�t .. Well, you know about the thong, don�t you?�

&nbsp;

I nodded.

&nbsp;

�If I do as they say then I get my pleasure
from the thong. Not like with you,� she looked at me, �or you,� she turned to Sukie, �but it�s so nice and it seems so right in here. So
I must exercise.�

&nbsp;

�That�s all right, Rachel.�

&nbsp;

�You should call me �Slave� really Sir, or
use my number.�� No sooner had the words
left her mouth than she gave an �Mmmm!� and clutched
at her crotch. She gave a satisfied �Ohhh�, swallowed
and blushed. I could see at once the effect of the reinforcing stimulation of
the thong in response to approved, conformant behaviour.

&nbsp;

I smiled. �Of course.
Run along Slave. Do your exercises. We can talk later. Remember what happens. I
want you to write it for me.�

&nbsp;

Rachel smiled and bowed her head. �Of
course, Sir,� she said. �It will be my pleasure.� She laughed and skipped off
towards the other room. Sukie and I left the room. I
took her back to our suite.

&nbsp;

�Rachel seems happy,� I said.

&nbsp;

�Yes,� said Sukie
slowly. �I think she is but only time will tell if this is right for her. Where
I was brought up it was usual for girls to learn to be subservient, to seek to
bring pleasure. Here in the west it is not part of your culture. Perhaps it can
be learned when you are older. I am not sure.�

&nbsp;

�I�m not sure either, Sukie,�
I said. �But I hope you will help her. It�s what she wants.� 

&nbsp;

�And it will be difficult for you.�

&nbsp;

�For me?�

&nbsp;

�It�s not easy to have someone who depends
on you. You�ve been kind to her and to me. But being kind is not easy. Cruelty
is always easier.�

&nbsp;

As always Sukie
gave me a valuable insight. I hadn�t really thought about what would happen
when Rachel completed her programme. All I had thought so far was that she
would be there, writing when I wanted. That and the fact that
I�d have Freddie off of my back as well. I needed to think about what
was next.

&nbsp;

I went back to see the Doctor. �How�s she
doing?� I asked.

&nbsp;

�Well,� she said. �Really
well. I mean she is obviously responding to the programme but it�s more
than that. She�s really taken it on board very willingly. She�s making much
quicker progress than the others we�ve put through it. We�ve started her on the
exerciser already.�

&nbsp;

�The excerciser? I knew she was doing some exercises but I wasn�t sure what was
involved.� 

&nbsp;

�You can have a look if you like.� The Doc
said, pulling back the curtains from a viewing panel that looked into part of
Rachel�s accommodation.

&nbsp;

Rachel was crouched, kneeling, over a metal
frame. She didn�t appear to be strapped to it but she was effectively held in
place by three plugs that protruded into her from the frame. One, at her head,
filled her mouth, the others penetrated her arse and
her vagina. The set up looked very similar to the cages and frames that we�d
been using in Orientation for some time. Rachel�s fingers could reach buttons
that were connected by wires to the plugs and to other wires that attached to
her nipples.

&nbsp;

�This is about reinforcing her ability to
give herself pleasure. The thong gives her pleasure feed-back in return for
conformant behaviours. This allows her to get used to acting directly for her
own pleasure. The buttons control the activity of each of the plugs and the
wires. The plugs can expand and contract and move in and out. The wires deliver
low frequency pulses or short sharp shocks. The screen in front of her gives
her the sequence of buttons that she should press. As long as she follows the
sequence the plugs and wires deliver appropriately pleasurable stimuli. If she
makes a mistake or she doesn�t respond quickly enough the stimuli stop and she
has to wait for a while. That�s excruciating for her in her current state of
arousal so she has a high incentive to keep pressing the buttons. It helps
reinforce the idea that conformance brings pleasure. At this stage is pretty
much the equivalent to the thong, just more intensive and covering more
points.� Rachel gave a moan. I could see she was sucking vigorously on the plug
that filled her mouth as it moved backwards and forwards slowly. �After this
she�ll be given a target score to achieve during a particular period and
allowed to make her own choices about which stimuli she uses in what order.�
The screen in front of Rachel changed again and she gave another squeal and
bucked her hips as the pulsing at her mouth was succeeded by a thrusting motion
form the plug that penetrated her cunt.

&nbsp;

�What will she be like, Doc?� I said. �When
she�s finished?�

&nbsp;

�I�d have thought she�d be every man�s
dream,� the Doctor said. �Obedient, respectful, willing to
please and desperate for sex at every opportunity.�

&nbsp;

�That�s going to take quite some living up
to,� I said.

&nbsp;

�She�s a writer isn�t she?� I nodded.
�She�ll be anxious to do whatever you want. So if you want her to write, she
will. She�ll be very keen to please � she should produce good work, just
because it will be important to please you. She�ll need stimulation in return,
of course. You�ll have to maintain the positive feed-back at least for a while.
But you can do that with the thong. Or you could grant her time on the
exerciser. Or,� she gave me a look that suggested she�d already decided that I
was a complete degenerate, �you can take care of things yourself. I�d advise a
combination of the three really. Unless you want to completely wear yourself
out. I�ll warn you that her appetite will almost certainly exceed your ability
to respond.� 

&nbsp;

I could see that I had plenty to think
about. 

Chapter 53: �The Price of Friendship

&nbsp;

I gave Freddie an update on Rachel�s
progress. He seemed happy. I was wondering whether he was really worried about
the outcome or whether he was just keen to see me getting fully involved.
Whichever was the case, the threat of violent intervention appeared to have
receded.

&nbsp;

Rachel was still completing the programme. I�d
called Sarah into my office. She appeared, smartly dressed as always her
clearly visible collar the only real indication of her slave status, exactly on
time. �Good morning, Mr Ross,� she said brightly. �It�s so nice to be back
here. How can I help?�

&nbsp;

I told her that I wanted to talk to her
about her experiences with Brad and Lauren to help build up my picture of the
ways that our customers used their purchases. I could see she was uncomfortable
with the idea of re-visiting the past few weeks but I wasn�t really interested
in her concerns and I brushed them aside. �I�m sorry, Sarah, I�m sure you
didn�t enjoy it but that�s hardly the point is it?�

&nbsp;

�But Larry,� she began.

&nbsp;

�I think we�ll keep this on a formal basis,
#06.085,� I said using her slave number. You could see that she wasn�t used to
it. It brought her up short.

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry, er,
Sir,� she said, dropping her head, submissively. �Of course, I�ll answer any
questions that you have.�

&nbsp;

�Good, that�s better, Sarah,� I responded.
She smiled. �Carry on in that way and we�ll get along just fine.�

&nbsp;

�Of course, Sir,� she said.

&nbsp;

I picked up my note book. This would have
been easier with Rachel to take notes and write things up but I could manage.
She was well on in her programme but I didn�t going to use her for things like
this just yet. �So,� I said, �tell me about your duties at the Castle.�

&nbsp;

�Umm, well, I didn�t really have anything
much to do for the Emir, you know. He left on some business trip and I was
supposed to be taking care of his daughter. Well, she took that to mean I was
to be her personal slave. Most of the time I was running around for her finding
meals or drinks or getting her things when she was down by the pool. Fetching
and carrying really. I mean she shouted at me a lot and she locked me in the
chastity belt when she found me with the guards by the pool but apart from
that, she was alright I suppose.�

&nbsp;

�Beatings or other
punishments?�

&nbsp;

�Well no, not really. I mean I try to do a
good job so perhaps she didn�t have cause to. She did slap my face once when
she thought I hadn�t been quick enough to bring something but apart from that,
until she locked me in the pillory, she hadn�t beaten me at all. It was all a
bit sudden. I didn�t expect it; she just seemed to suddenly decide I�d crossed
some invisible line. Thinking about it maybe she had her eyes on one of the
guards for herself.������ 

&nbsp;

I thought about what Sarah was saying.
Lauren was obviously inexperienced.�
Keeping slaves needed skills like any other form of management. I knew
from my own background that if you wanted staff to change it was best to pick
up undesirable behaviour early on. �But then who sends you to slave keeping
school?� I thought. It was an interesting thought. I made a note of it. Maybe
there was an opportunity related to the expansion in markets with new slave
keepers emerging. How else would they learn about security, appropriate
punishment, care and feeding? It wasn�t intuitive, after all.

&nbsp;

Sarah carried on talking about her
experiences serving Lauren. It sounded pretty much as though Lauren had just
wanted a housemaid, although amusingly Sarah was absolutely banned from
cleaning up Lauren�s room. Lauren had been very concerned that her father
shouldn�t get the wrong idea, she wanted it to look like a tip and so it was
left. 

&nbsp;

I quizzed her some more. No, the guards
hadn�t raped her; Brad was very tight on discipline and wouldn�t allow it,
although a couple of the guards had asked him if they could. No, Lauren hadn�t
tried to use her sexually either, hadn�t made any mention of it. 

&nbsp;

I asked her about her living arrangements.
It had been fairly comfortable because there hadn�t been any other slaves in
the castle at the time, she�d had a room to herself, locked in at night, of
course, and the way things were set up now there would have been three others
in the room and they�d have been locked to their beds but they hadn�t bothered
with that because she was on her own. The daily routine started at 6 o�clock with cleaning and getting the house ready. Lauren usually called
her at about 9 when she woke up and she�d have to serve breakfast in her room.
After that, it was whatever Lauren wanted, blended in with a routine of house
cleaning and odd bits of secretarial work whenever Brad phoned in. It wasn�t
arduous. The main problem was the boredom.���


&nbsp;

We spent an hour or so talking. I thought
I�d got some useful ideas out of it. It was clear that new slave keepers and
the expansion of the market into slaves for women was going to need different
training arrangements. I sent Sarah back to Harry and set about drafting a note
to Rick and Freddie on my thoughts. That took me up to lunch time. 

&nbsp;

Rick caught Harry, Tricia and myself in the canteen. We�d just finished lunch. He dropped
his own tray alongside us. �Snatched any good women lately?� he asked.

&nbsp;

Harry just looked up from his coffee.

&nbsp;

�I�ve got an answer to that memo of yours �
about the Cindy collection.�

&nbsp;

�Good,� said Harry. �How does it look?�

&nbsp;

�OK, I think. We found her all right,
although your details were a bit misleading.�

&nbsp;

�How come,� said Harry, warily.

&nbsp;

�Well we�ve got a Cindy Bailey.� Works for a motor dealer.
Used to work in their Rugby branch.�

&nbsp;

�That sounds right,� Harry said.

&nbsp;

�We thought so. Only thing is your note
said you thought she�d be in Coventry now. She�s actually in Solihull.�

&nbsp;

�Fair enough, it�s not that far away. She
could have moved again.�

&nbsp;

Rick shook his head. �Nope.
Been there all the time since they closed the Rugby branch. And its
not a BMW dealer, either, it�s Mercedes. Your note sent us on a bit of a wild
goose chase.�

&nbsp;

Harry grunted.

&nbsp;

�Anyway, do you want to run through the
details?�

&nbsp;

�Yeah sure,� said Harry, �I�d finished
lunch anyway.�

&nbsp;

�Fine,� said Rick pulling a manila file out
from under his tray. �I thought you would. He opened the file. �Let�s see.
Cindy Bailey, 25 years old, red head, neat body. Looks quite like your Sarah,
thinking about it.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah,� said Harry, �I know. In fact that�s
the idea.�

&nbsp;

Rick went on, reading from the file. �Lives on her own, small flat, edge of Solihull. Split up from a
bloke about a month back. Sounds like it was a pretty
bruising relationship. Works for Mercedes in Solihull as one of their �sales negotiators�. Quite good at it by all reckoning.�

&nbsp;

�I thought Sarah said she had more of a PA
/ admin role,� I said chipping in.

&nbsp;

�That�s right,� said Rick. �She did. That�s
what she started as when she moved up from Rugby. Changed over to this about six months later.
Three months after that she bought the flat. Makes her
targets every month. One of their best performers if I
believe my sources.�

&nbsp;

�They seem to be more reliable than mine,�
said Harry with an acidic tone.�� 

�

�That�s what you pay research for,� Rick
chirped. �There�s pictures in here including a couple
that we sneaked of her sunbathing on the back of a truck behind the garage.
Certainly a saleable body if you ask me. Takes a lot of
trouble with her looks. Spends on the clothes, make up, jewellery. May even have had a bit of a perk-em-up job
done on the front lady bumps. They shouldn�t point up at the sky like
that when she�s laying on her back, I think.�

&nbsp;

Harry winced at Rick�s use of language. �OK.
What�s the collection proposal?�

&nbsp;

�The flat�s a possibility but it�s not
great. It�s on the second floor,� Harry grimaced, �but there�s access at the
rear through a garden and out to an alley way. Couldn�t get a van down there
though and it�s maybe 80 yards to the road running down behind seven other
properties. You�d get in that way all right but you�d probably have to bring
her out through the front. Social venues are a bit unpredictable after dumping
her bloke. My favourite is to set up something around work maybe. She�s out and
about a lot of the time. Seems to manage her own
diary. They don�t keep very close tabs on her. You could maybe show some
interest in a motor, take it for a spin with her, use your usual charm, just
don�t take her back.�

&nbsp;

�That could work,� said Harry. �Are there
details on the garage in the file?�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, sure,� said Rick, passing him the
file. �Here you go.�

&nbsp;

I really didn�t have time to get involved
in the Cindy Bailey collection, after spending effort with the other pick-ups
for the Emir. They are fun to go on but, it�s not really the job and besides I
needed to finish mapping out the account management programme for Freddie. It
looked like I was going to need a team of two or three to cover the Kushtian
side of things, two more for the UK and
one for our north American accounts. That would
probably grow and there was Europe to think about too. It was hard to be precise. I thought that would
be better would be to establish the criteria for appointing account managers
and then run with that, building up the numbers as the opportunities allowed. I
could see suggesting getting a big team on board from day one, even if I�d
thought Freddie would go for it, which I didn�t.

&nbsp;

I was still beavering
away at my ideas a couple of evenings later when Tricia walked in closely
followed by Harry and a bound Sarah. Harry sat Sarah down and tossed his
knapsack onto the desk alongside of her. Tricia untied Sarah�s wrists.

&nbsp;

�Easy job,� said Tricia. �Easy
job.�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� said Harry, �you did that well.
You�re certainly coming on. That�s got our little red-headed girl in the bag,
so we can keep the Emir happy.�

&nbsp;

�Oh right,� I said, �this was the Cindy
Collection was it?� Sarah was busying herself tidying away the contents of
Harry�s knapsack into the cupboard in his office. She said nothing.

&nbsp;

�Yepp,� said
Harry. �They�re just getting her out of the back of her car down in the loading
bay.�

&nbsp;

�It went all right then?�

&nbsp;

�Sure it did, thanks to your girl here and
some help from Sarah.�

&nbsp;

Tricia chipped in. �It was pretty straight
forward really. Harry and I posed as a couple of potential buyers. Looking for
a fleet deal for a new business we�re establishing, maybe half a dozen sales
exec cars plus four higher spec models for board members. Cindy was hot to trot
for an order like that. Like we expected, she didn�t even stop to tell her boss
where she was going. Anyway she pulled out all the stops. Took
us for a test drive in a S600L All very nice.�

&nbsp;

�Then we just had to get her bagged,� said
Harry. �We asked her to stop at our hotel. We said we were renting a couple or
rooms as a base until we got the offices set up. She didn�t really want to come
up to our room but we said�.�

&nbsp;

�There was an old friend that wanted to
meet her. Didn�t she know a girl called Sarah in her last job? She was now
working for us and would hate to miss seeing her. Well Cindy�s really keen to
see her old friend, says how they lost touch what with the problems with her ex
and all and that she�d meant to get back in touch with her again but she�d
never got around to it and it would be great to see her again.�

&nbsp;

�So we all walk up to the room and sure
enough Sarah�s in there, and Cindy says �Hi!� and that moment is all we need.� 

&nbsp;

�By the time she realises anything is
wrong, Harry�s in behind her with a chloro pad and
she�s stretched out on the floor of the room. I get her taped up and quiet with
a nice big wad of cloth in her mouth. Used some of the new
lip glue to keep her mouth shut like we had with Sarah. Oh shit � I
forgot to tell the guys on the loading bay we�d used chloro.
She�ll vomit all over them as soon as they loosen off her lips and take that
gag out.� She looked at her watch. �Oh well, probably too late now. Anyway, we
wait until dark, slip her out the back way and into the back of the S600L. She
and Sarah ride in the back strapped in and sitting up nice as you please. Cindy�s
still out, Sarah�s trussed up, both of them with their lips glued shut - from
outside they look normal as anything. We motor quietly back here.�

&nbsp;

What�s all this about lip glue? Is this
something new?

�� ��

�Yes,� said Tricia. �It�s quite useful
stuff. It�s a high-strength skin glue. Works pretty
well instantaneously but you can loosen it off with the right solvent. You can
put it in all sorts of stuff. Like a lip-stick, for example. Can�t you Sarah?�

&nbsp;

�Mmmm,� said
Sarah in response and I realised that her lip glue gag was still in place.

&nbsp;

�You should have seen the look on her face
when she realised what had happened! We gave her the lipstick as we were going
out and suggested she try it. A couple of strokes, she purses her lips in the
mirror and � whap � they�re stuck together. There was
quite a lot of mmphing, you can imagine but there was
no way we were taking her out on a job without some security in place and that
proved ideal. We walked her into the hotel with no problems. Got
her set up behind the desk with her ankles roped and tied to the chair.
From the front it looked like she was just sitting at the desk. She couldn�t
say anything with her lips glued shut. We left a baby sitter with her to make
sure she behaved until we got back with Cindy the sales lady. I reckon we�ll
use the stuff again.� 

&nbsp;

�How was Sarah? She must have found it
hard, helping you pick her friend up?�

&nbsp;

�That was the deal,� said Harry, grimly.
�She was to supposed to help and in return she didn�t
get sold to the Emir. A deal is a deal in my book. If she hadn�t wanted to be
involved she shouldn�t have said anything in the first place.�

&nbsp;

�And,� said Tricia, �we�ve
got a nice new limo for the business. Plus there was a whole pile of Cindy�s
work files and her laptop in the boot. Might be some
interesting stuff there. Harry, I�d like to get Research to check it
out. If there�s any follow ups on this then perhaps it�s a project I could take
a lead on.�

&nbsp;

�Maybe,� said Harry. �I�ll think about it.�

Chapter 54 : The Kushtians of Suburbia

&nbsp;

There were three clear bangs on the door of
the wardrobe. That meant that Kelly had had enough. I put down the mug of tea
that I�d made for myself and walked back across the room. I pulled open the
wardrobe. Even with the blindfold on she knew I was there. She gave a
whimpering moan and shrugged her body against the ropes that pinned her arms to
her sides.

&nbsp;

I lifted her out of the wardrobe, carried
her across my shoulder to the far side of the room and dumped her down on the
bed. 

&nbsp;

Her blouse was soaked in sweat from the
effort she had put into trying to free herself. That was all she had to show
for her trouble. I�d learned a bit about the erotic uses of bondage from her
magazines. I don�t think anyone in Harry�s team ever bothered with a crotch
rope for example and the �lift and separate� effect of ropes across the chest
and between the tits seemed to have a purely aesthetic purpose that they hadn�t
latched on to either. I won�t complain you understand. I�ve always enjoyed the
visual arts. I eased away the scarf that gagged her. She coughed and
spluttered, using her tongue to work out the pair of sports socks that I�d
wadded into her mouth. Still blindfolded she fell back on the bed, breathing
deeply.

&nbsp;

�You are a bastard, you know,� she said,
working her sore and aching mouth and still trying to wriggle free of the ropes
that held her body, wrists and ankles.� 

&nbsp;

�I thought that was the attraction,� I
said, reaching out to run a finger across where her belly had been exposed as
her blouse had pulled loose from the waistband of her skirt by her struggles.

&nbsp;

It had been quite a while since we had seen
each other. I�d been busy with Rachel and there had been problems with Tricia
too. I hadn�t really intended to see Kelly but she�d left me a text on my
mobile and then we�d chatted and suddenly it had seemed like a good idea.

&nbsp;

�If you�re nice to me I might fix you some
dinner,� she said.

&nbsp;

�How about if I�m nasty
to you?�

&nbsp;

�Then I could do something even nicer,� she
giggled. I reached across and pulled away the scarf that was blindfolding her.
Her long, dark hair fell loosely across the pillow. She smiled up at me.� �That was fun,� she said, moving herself
slowly into a sitting position, still stiff from the hour or so she�d spent in
the wardrobe. She looked at my mug of tea. �Where�s mine?� she asked. �And look
at this place; you could have cleared up while I was in there.�

&nbsp;

She was right I supposed, but I wasn�t
going to admit it. She put quite a struggle when I told her what I was going to
do with her. One of the armchairs had been upended and the coffee table had got
kicked over too. The remains of the Chinese take away meal she�d had last night
were spread across the floor, a broken plate lay where it had fallen.� Luckily the carpet was patterned, the added
stains wouldn�t show. �Slaves make their own tea,� I said starting to untie the
ropes that were knotted about her, �and if they don�t want a mess they
shouldn�t resist their captors. Beside, I wanted to watch the news.� I nodded
to the television. 

&nbsp;

She made a noise that suggested to me she
wasn�t entirely convinced by my arguments. I got the last of the ropes off. She
flexed her arms and rubbed at her wrists. �Did you want some more tea?� she
said.

&nbsp;

�Sure,� I replied. I passed her my mug. She
picked her way across the room towards the kitchen, avoiding treading in the
debris in her stockinged feet.

&nbsp;

�Oh, there�s a magazine there I thought
you�d find interesting,� she called from the kitchen. �On the
table. Or at least it was before you turned up.� 

&nbsp;

I pulled a magazine out from under the
coffee table. �National Geographic?� I called back to
her. �Not usually my sort of reading. Not yours either if my memory serves me
right.� I thought back to the fetish magazines I�d discovered in her bedroom.

&nbsp;

�No, look at the cover story,� she called.
�Right up your street if the way you play is anything to go by. I�ll be there
in a moment. The kettle is just boiling.��


&nbsp;

I looked at the yellow cover,
two almond eyes set in light brown skin stared out at me from above an
elaborately embroidered yashmak. �Veiled &amp; In Chains,� the headline read.
�The Women Of The Kushtian Uplands.�

&nbsp;

�See what I mean?� Kelly emerged form the
kitchen clutching two mugs of tea.

&nbsp;

�Extraordinary,� I said, taking a mug from
her and thumbing through the article. �I wouldn�t have believed it.� That at
least was true enough; I wouldn�t have believed it before I�d met the Kalinin. I think
she thought I meant before reading the article. 

&nbsp;

Kelly plonked down on the couch beside me.
�Look at that poor girl,� she said pointing to a photograph of a veiled women
carrying a water pitcher on her head, ornamental chains running from her wrists
to an elaborate collar. 

&nbsp;

�Poor girl?� I said. �It looks like just the sort of thing you�d like; slave of
a rugged tribesman kept in chains and subject to his every whim if I believe
this article.�

&nbsp;

�It would depend on the rugged tribesman,�
she said, placing her hand on the top of my thigh in a way that indicated that
I would probably qualify. She pulled a corner of the bed sheet up over her
mouth and nose. �How do you think I�d look in a veil,� she said flirtatiously. 

&nbsp;

�Just fine,� I said.

&nbsp;

�Pig!� she exclaimed, throwing down the
sheet. �That�s one of those questions you�re not supposed to answer honestly.�

&nbsp;

I laughed and took a swig of my tea.

&nbsp;

She was as good as her promise and cooked
some food. While she was busy I read the article. It had been written by Dr
Karen Armstrong, an American anthropologist, who had smuggled herself disguised
as a boy across the border from the north with a trading caravan. She had taken
some extraordinary photographs of the women of the northern tribesmen and some
of the tribesmen themselves. From the article it sounded like the tribesmen had
a very similar society to that in Kolin but without
the sophistication of city life. The author seemed to think that the growth of
urban culture in Kolin would eventually dilute the
primitive traditional ways of the tribes. She also thought the change from the
soviet command economy to a western market economy and the introduction of
democracy would also lead to emancipation for the hill tribeswomen. From what
I�d seen of life in Kolin I wasn�t so sure. 

&nbsp;

We didn�t have any shackles so I had Kelly
serve dinner in handcuffs and with the sheet draped across her in a Kushtian
fashion. She wasn�t too pleased when I made her kneel beside me holding the
tray while I ate from it, and it didn�t get any better when I pushed her ball
gag in behind her veil to silence her protests.

&nbsp;

She came around in the end and was showing
every sign of becoming a suitably compliant Kushtian wife by the end of the
evening. She certainly picked up the idea that Kushtian women were expected to
serve their men as sexual playthings, happily accommodating me in a range of
entertaining positions before allowing me to remove her gag so that she could
use her mouth as well. She wasn�t as accomplished a veil wearer as the girls I
met in Kolin but in every other respect I thought she
did quite a good job.

&nbsp;

Just as I was about to leave I picked up
Kelly�s copy on National Geographic. I turned the pages, leafing through the
pictures of the veiled, chained women. Kelly came over beside me. �The funny
thing is,� she said, �they all look really content. Look at their eyes, bright
and smiling even if their mouths are hidden. Perhaps it�s not such a bad life
for real.�

&nbsp;

�Is that what your friends at the munch would think?� I asked.

&nbsp;

�Gosh, no,� she said. �They�d think I was
mad. Well, most of them, would. Probably.�

&nbsp;

I wondered. It might be interesting to find
out. I wondered what the Kushtians thought about it too.

Chapter 55 : Sarah &amp; Cindy

&nbsp;

Cindy didn�t spend too long in prep. The
Emir wanted his new acquisitions �fresh� as he called it. That was fine by us.
I�d gone down to the customer lounge to join Rick for the handover of the
remaining eight of the Emir�s household slaves, four house maids, three for
�entertaining� clients and his new PA. We�d got together pretty much everything
he�d wanted and, of course Cindy as well. Tricia had suggested using Brian�s
daughters, Beth and Ella, as two of the �entertainers�, I didn�t want to do
that, I thought that output from the sexualisation
programme should be more use than just general purpose bounce fodder but Tricia
said we ought to be getting some benefit from the family.� We�d had an argument about it. We were doing
a lot of that lately. In the end my point of view was the one we went with. It
wasn�t really a marketing decision but Freddie didn�t want to argue about it.

&nbsp;

The Emir was due anytime so Rick had the
guards bring the girls in and line them up. Brad had been clear that he�d want
to check them out before he took delivery, so we�d had the girls stripped. All
nine of them were standing in a line, wrists and ankles shackled, collared as
always. They wore ball gags hanging loosely around their necks waiting to be put
in place when needed. There was the usual mix of looks of sullen resentment,
terrified acceptance and cowed compliance on the girl�s faces as Rick checked
them off against the list he had on his clip board.

&nbsp;

Sarah appeared, smiling and looking as
efficient as ever, in a tight black skirt and an equally tight white blouse.
She handed an envelope to Rick. �Harry asked me to give you this,� she said.
She suddenly saw Cindy at the far end of the line. At least Sarah had the grace
to look embarrassed, I thought. Cindy of course had had enough prep to know
that she shouldn�t react. Even so, I could imagine that she was angered by the
sight of Sarah.

&nbsp;

Rick was puzzling over Harry�s letter. �Why
does he leave these things to the last minute?� he was asking himself. �It always more difficult if you don�t have time to sort things out
properly.�

&nbsp;

�Can I help?� offered Sarah. Rick was
scribbling something on his clipboard and fiddling with a pile of numbered tags
in his hand. 

&nbsp;

�Err, oh, err, yes. Thank you Sarah,� he responded.
�If you could just clip these asset transfer tags on each of the girls listed
on the sheet and check them off. Just make sure the tags and the numbers on the
sheet agree with the numbers on their collars, can you?�

&nbsp;

�Of course,� said Sarah taking the board
and tags from him. 

&nbsp;

Rick went back to reading Harry�s note.
Sarah worked her way down the line checking each girl�s number in turn and
fastening a tag to her collar. She got to the end and found herself facing
Cindy. The two of them exchanged looks. Cindy�s failed to convey the contempt
she felt for her former friend, Sarah�s couldn�t show her sorrow and regret.
Sarah checked the collar and the tag. She came back over to Rick.

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry,� she said, �but the last one
doesn�t tally. Its got all of Cindy�s details here but her number has been
scribbled out and another written in. Should I just put the tag on her or
should we find the girl with this number, #06.085?� Sarah�s look suddenly
changed. Her hand flew up to her own collar. �Oh!� she exclaimed. �That�s my
number! That can�t be right.� 

&nbsp;

�Ah!� said Rick. �Now I understand. Sorry,
Silly of me. Yes. That�s right. If you could just step over there Sarah and
clip that tag on. Oh, and just pop your clothes off if you could there�s a good
girl.�

&nbsp;

�No, wait,� said Sarah, �I�m sure this is
wrong. I mean, the whole idea behind this was to � And then I helped, well,
with, her,� She nodded towards Cindy, � so that, and
�..�

&nbsp;

�Well, Sarah you may be right but I can�t
do anything about it right now. We�ll have to swap you and Cindy over for the
moment and we�ll sort it out later, I�m sure. I�ll see what I can do but I have
to follow the procedure. You know what a stickler for this sort of thing
Freddie is.�

&nbsp;

Sarah looked uncomfortable but could see no
choice but to comply.

&nbsp;

Rick turned to one of the guards. �Can you
take the one on the end back down to the cells for the time being,� he said
pointing to Cindy. �Now, come on Sarah, do as I asked. Get your clothes off and
get in line with the others and then we can get the shipment tallied and I can
try to sort things out.� Sarah watched as a puzzled Cindy was hustled away.
Rick turned to the rest of the girls. �Kneel down, please,� he said. �Ball gags
in place now. Thank you.�

&nbsp;

I watched as Sarah stripped off, taking off
the high necked white blouse and the pencil slim black skirt that she so often
wore around the office.� She looked
around for somewhere to put her clothes and draped her skirt carefully over the
back of a chair, adding her blouse and then her bra, panties and stockings. She
put her shoes neatly beside the chair and then stood, sheepishly waiting while
Rick continued to check off details on his clip board. 

&nbsp;

Rick looked up and saw the now naked Sarah.
�Ah, good,� he said, �that�s a help.� Sarah smiled. �If you could just go over there on the end. Oh, yes, sorry
I hadn�t given you one of these.� He passed her a ball gag and turned to one of
the guards. �Get some shackles on this one, could you. Thanks.�� He pointed to an increasingly confused and concerned
looking Sarah. The guard fastened shackles around her wrists and ankles and
clipped the asset transfer tag to her collar. He led her over to the line and
got her kneeling like the others. I heard voices in the corridor outside.

�

�Straighten up, ladies,� Rick called. �Hands on the back of your heads.� The girls responded,
Sarah last of all. �Come on all of you, make the best of yourselves, your new
owner is going to be here in a moment and you won�t want him to see you like
this. That�ll be no way to start.� The girls visibly stiffened their posture,
breasts were thrust forward and backs were arched. Even at this early stage
they�d worked out that displaying themselves to their best advantage was likely
to make their lives easier. Even Sarah responded.

&nbsp;

The Emir came into the room with Harry.
�Here we are,� said Harry to the Emir. �Just as we�ve
promised. You know Larry, of course.� He gave me a wave of greeting.
�Have you met Rick before? Runs the Preparation and Orientation activities
here.�

&nbsp;

�No,� said the Emir. �Good to meet you.
Looks like you�ve done a good job at first sight. I�ll need to look them over,
of course.�

&nbsp;

�Naturally,� said Rick. �Take your time.
They�re all yours.�

&nbsp;

�That�s the idea,� said Brad, laughing.
�Assuming the cheque clears.� The two of them went up to the first in line, Harry unbuckled the girl�s gag. Brad examined her
carefully, checking her body and her mouth as you would a piece of livestock at
a market. He worked his way along the line. A guard called Harry from the door.
He went across and the two of them muttered an exchange of words. The guard
went out and reappeared with Cindy. Clothed in a high necked white blouse and
tight black skirt, the resemblance to the way that Sarah had looked was
striking. Harry walked her across to Rick and the Emir who had just got to
Sarah.

&nbsp;

�Sorry to interrupt things,� said Harry. �I
thought I ought to introduce my new PA, Cindy, here.� She gave Rick and Brad a
smile, all the while ignoring, Sarah�s worried look. �I think she�ll prove a
little more reliable than the last one. Do you know she had the nerve to try to
deceive me? Girl like that has to be sold on, can�t keep her in an office like
mine once she�s shown she�s not 100% reliable.� Sarah looked frightened as she
realised the consequences of her deception. She tried to protest through her
gag but her whimpered, muffled, remarks did nothing more than to attract a
scowl from both Harry and the Emir

&nbsp;

�Well, whatever. Glad you decided to let me
have this one after all,� Brad said to Harry. �Now let�s just see that she�s
OK.� He ran his hands across her buttocks, down the outside of her thighs and
back up the inside. �She�s kept in trim, hasn�t she?� He asked rhetorically. He
moved his hands to her breasts. �You know these are nice,� he said. �Liked them
the first time I saw them in your office. Feel good too, all real. You can
tell.� Sarah bit back a whimper. �Can I?� he gestured to Sarah�s mouth.

&nbsp;

�Cindy, take this one�s gag off, will you.
Beat her if she makes a sound.� Harry instructed his new PA.

&nbsp;

�Of course, Sir,� Cindy said compliantly,
unbuckling the gag and pulling the ball from Sarah�s mouth as the Emir prodded
and probed at her body. Sarah wisely kept silent.

�

��Open your mouth, girl.� Brad pulled back her
lips and peered inside. �Yeah that looks all right. I had a slave that cost me
a fortune in dental bills once but she looks all right. Not too much metal work
in there and the teeth look OK. Fine.� He pushed her
mouth closed and then turned her head this way and that peering at her eyes,
ears and skin. �OK, she�ll do. A few more piercings
in her ears and maybe some other places but I can get that done all right.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, please, wait,� Sarah blurted out.
Cindy went to pick up a riding crop from the nearby chair.

&nbsp;

�That�s all right, Cindy,� said Harry.
�What is it, err� he reached out for her tag, �#06.085?�

&nbsp;

�Oh, thank, you, I�m sure there�s some
confusion Ha�, err, Sir. I�m sure you�ve misunderstood what I said about Cindy
and � Well, it�s just that I�m not supposed to be part of this shipment, I only
came down to help out with the tags and there was some mistake and now I�m�� 

&nbsp;

Harry cut her off. �Is this right Rick?� he
said. �Not like you to make a mistake.� Rick shrugged. �I know how to sort this
out,� Harry said. �Let�s make sure that Rick�s shipment list tallies with mine.
If that�s the case then we�re all right.� He turned to Cindy. �Could you just
check our list against Rick�s, Cindy? Just see if the two sets of item numbers
are the same.�

&nbsp;

Cindy sashayed across the room to the table
where Rick�s clipboard lay on the desk. I watched her arse trying to fight
against the skirt that covered it. It was an entertaining few moments. She
spent a couple of minutes ticking off numbers on the
two lists and turned back to the two groups. �The two lists tally, exactly,
Sir,� she said, putting Rick�s clipboard down and returning to the group.

&nbsp;

�I thought so,� said Harry. �We�ve heard
enough from this one. See to it, will you Cindy.�

&nbsp;

Sarah watched in numbed astonishment as
Cindy took her ball gag and jammed it back into her mouth before she could
utter another protest. For good measure Cindy clipped Sarah�s wrist cuffs to
the back of her collar. I heard the click of the ratchet on her cuffs as Cindy
pushed the cuffs closed more tightly. �I hope that�s not too tight for you,�
she said with a voice devoid of concern. 

&nbsp;

�Excellent,� said Brad. �I�m glad that�s
sorted out. All to the good. My daughter�s really
looking forward to having this one around the house again,� Sarah looked more
concerned than ever, �and Lauren�s going to need sweetening up a bit when she
finds out she�s off to Kushtia in a month. I�ll sign off on these and you can
ship them. OK?�

&nbsp;

�Sure,� said Rick waving to a Guard. He
picked up his clipboard. �Loading Bay 5,� he said. �They can go down now.� 

&nbsp;

The guard set to linking each girl�s wrist
shackles to the collar of the next girl in line. Sarah was at the front. He
clipped a leash to her collar and jerked her forward, �Right, keep up you lot.
Let�s move!�

&nbsp;

The line of slaves shuffled across the room
following the guard and Sarah. As she passed Cindy, Harry�s new PA hissed
quietly to her, �As if I�d be living in Coventry! You could
have thought of somewhere more up market!�

&nbsp;

Sarah whimpered, the leash tightened, and
she was pulled towards the loading bay. As she left the room, her last sight
was of Cindy picking up her discarded clothes from the chair and dumping them
in a trash can.

&nbsp;

Brad smiled and shook hands all round.
�Good job,� he said, �good job. Nice to see you guys do what you say.� He took
me to one side. �Did you see the piece in National Geographic?�

&nbsp;

I nodded. �Yes, I guess it caused some
excitement back home?�

&nbsp;

�Well, yes and no,� he said surprisingly.
�Come on, you�re a marketing man. I know they say there�s no such thing as bad
publicity but what do you think we should be doing about it?�

&nbsp;

I thought for a moment. �Look,� I said,
�I�m no expert on international affairs but I�d have thought that the best
course is to ignore it. You can�t pretend it�s not real. Maybe you could try to
discredit the author but I don�t think that gets you anywhere. I�d suggest that
you just brazen it out if there is any adverse comment. Sort of �it�s our way
of life, has been for centuries, all part of the rich global variety of cultural
heritage� approach.�

&nbsp;

Brad didn�t look convinced. �Maybe,� he
said. �Still it�s not my call. I�m waiting to hear from the Foreign Ministry
what the line is.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, I�d have thought they should have got
their act together a bit quicker. You people on the ground need to know how to
play it.�

&nbsp;

�Tell me about it,� said Brad. �Tell me
about it. Still, there�s other stuff to worry about right now. Gotta get back
to the Castle. See you. Thanks for your thought on that Nat Geog thing.�


&nbsp;

He gave me a wave and left.

� 

I bumped into Elly
as I was leaving the room. To say she wasn�t happy would be putting things
mildly. �Just help me get the facts right on this,� she said. �You�ve taken
Harry�s PA, whose been working on Clegg Enterprises Business for the last three
months. Who�s seen our entire operation inside and out.
Who�s had probably one of the lowest levels of prep and orientation that any of
the product has going through here. And you�ve sold
her to that nutter with the country girl camp in
Gloucestershire?�

&nbsp;

I could sense this wasn�t a time for
prevaricating. �It wasn�t my call,� I said, �but as facts go, if you mean, �are
we shipping Sarah to the Emir?� the answer is yes.�

&nbsp;

�If it wasn�t your call, who�s
was it?�� 

&nbsp;

�Well, Head of Sales approves shipment lists.
And that�s Freddie these days.�

&nbsp;

�You know he hasn�t got time to read all
that stuff,� Elly said.

&nbsp;

�Not my fault. He could put a new Head of
Sales in place. That whole piece of the organisation is broken, Elly. Brian may have been useless and a crook but at least
he had time to read things before he signed them. Look, Harry was pretty hacked
off with how Sarah held out on him, Cindy looks like a good alternative. Sarah
was what the Emir wanted in the first place. It sounded like a good idea to
me.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, and you know so much about this
business.�

&nbsp;

�No, I don�t and that�s why it wasn�t my
call and why I haven�t wanted to take on that part of things. I can tell you
what to sell and where to sell it and who to sell it to but I don�t have the
background for decisions on individual cases. For what it�s worth I can see
where you�re coming from. I�m not convinced that the Emir is the right solution
but he thinks he�s bought her. If more experienced people than me are getting
it wrong, I suggest you take it up with them.�

&nbsp;

Elly seemed to calm down. �Sorry Larry,� she said. I made a mental note
to remember that; apologies from Elly weren�t common.
�I�ll get Rick to delay the shipment and I�ll talk to Freddie about it. You�re right, he needs to find someone he can delegate this stuff
to.�

&nbsp;

I heard her on the phone not long after.
She was talking to the Emir in her most emollient tones. �Well, thank you Brad,
it�s so good of you to be so understanding. There�s
just a question of the title transfer on that one. �. Yes, I know we said we�d
substitute originally �. Yes, well I guess it will be best if we sort things
out from our side first. .. You�re happy if we ship the others?� Fine. We�ll do that
then. I�ll get back to you.� She put down the phone with a look of relief. She
turned towards me. �Right we�ve got a bit of time to sort this out. We�re going
to need some ideas and you�re supposed to be good at that. Better start
thinking.�

Chapter 56:
Rachel�s Recovery

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The whole conversation was a bit difficult,
I guess you could say. Elly wanted to sort out what we were going to do about
Sarah, Cindy and the Emir�s PA position and she recognised that Freddie wasn�t
doing the job that needed to be done looking after sales. I wanted to solve the
Rachel and Sukie problems. Harry just sounded as though he was resenting the
fact that all this was taking up time he needed to work on Ops matters.

&nbsp;

Freddie was sitting at one end of the table
peering inscrutably over his hands as Elly expressed her concerns on letting
Sarah out of the business. �I don�t have a problem with using these girls on
internal work but we�ve got to recognise that when we do they collect a lot of
knowledge that might embarrass us later. And it�s not just where they go to
next it�s what happens to them after that, we�ve got no control of who they
might be sold on to.�

&nbsp;

Freddie looked pensive. �So what do you
think we should do?�

&nbsp;

Elly was blunt. �Leaving aside the current
problem, there�s three alternatives. Either we don�t use them internally. Or we
do and if they turn out unsuitable we carry the costs of keeping them in house
but not using them. Or we do and if they turn out unsuitable we, to put it
bluntly, dispose of them in a way that doesn�t put us at risk.� 

&nbsp;

�You know I don�t like wasting assets,
Elly,� Clegg said. I wasn�t quite sure which meaning of the word �wasting� he
was using. �And I�m not keen on letting the costs of keeping them go up. All
right, it�s cheaper than paying staff but that�s not the point. Harry, what�s
your view?�

&nbsp;

�Well,� he said, �I know it�s my girl that
triggered this but actually I think Elly�s right. We ought to have a consistent
policy.�

&nbsp;

�OK and how are our two current problems?�

&nbsp;

�They are both in secure accommodation on a
no contact regime.� I knew what that meant. It would get pretty boring in those
hoods. �I didn�t want things to get any more complicated.� 

&nbsp;

�Fine,� said Freddie. �Larry what�s your
take?�

&nbsp;

�I�m not so sure,� I said warily. �Look, I
can�t really have a point of view on what�s secure or what�s not. I just don�t
know enough about it. It�s pretty obvious Sarah can�t go back to working for
Harry, she�s lost his confidence. Equally she�s been too involved in the
business just to be sold on. We need to supply something to the Emir, we�re
committed on that and it needs to be Sarah or Cindy. My suggestion would be
Cindy.�

&nbsp;

�And what do we do with the other one?�

&nbsp;

�I think we can find a use for her. We
could put her through the same programme that Brian�s family and Rachel have
been through. At the end of it she won�t care what it is that she did in the
past, she�d be completely absorbed in the pursuit of pleasure. We could use her
for what we like then.�

&nbsp;

�Which might be?�

&nbsp;

�Well, I�ve been thinking about this for a
while � since we brought in Brian�s family, really - but I hadn�t really
finished getting all my ducks in a row yet, so I hadn�t mentioned it. What I�d
been thinking was � as we�re starting to see more slave owners appear, some
with very little idea of how to look after slaves � I mean imagine I was trying
to handle Rachel and Sukie on my own � these new owners, some of them don�t
have the first idea of how to do it. They�ve got some romantic idea about
having a couple of women on tap but its much more complicated than that. We
could help them. Run a sort of training school. �Slave Keeping 101� that sort
of thing.�

&nbsp;

Freddie was thinking. He didn�t say
anything. Elly cut in, �And we�d use Sarah and Brian�s family as the teaching
aids?�

&nbsp;

�That was my thought,� I said. �Look this
isn�t a fully formed idea by any means. It needs a proper plan and�.�

&nbsp;

�No,� said Clegg. I felt defeated. �No, it
doesn�t need a plan. I think we should try it. We�ve got the resources.� Let�s see if it works. It�s the sort of thing
we should be doing to help develop the customers � the more we can do for them
the more their likely to buy from us. Don�t spend time planning, spend time
doing. That is unless anyone�s got a better idea?� 

&nbsp;

Harry, Rick and Elly all shook their heads.
�Sounds fine to me,� said Elly.

&nbsp;

�Good,� said Clegg. �That�s decided. Get on
with it, Larry. The lads will help out.� Harry and Rick both looked relieved.

&nbsp;

Elly wasn�t going to let the issue of who
was running sales to slide. �And sales management?� she said. 

&nbsp;

Clegg sucked in his cheeks. They�d
obviously discussed it before and it looked like he�d been hoping the problem
would go away. �All right. I can see you think it�s not working like this,
Elly.� She gave him one of her most inscrutable looks. �I�ll look at moving one
of the account managers up into a coordinating role. We don�t need a sales
director, I don�t think.�

&nbsp;

�But we do need someone to take day to day
responsibility for sales management,� said Elly.

&nbsp;

�Agreed,� said Clegg. �Leave it with me.
I�ll fix it.�

&nbsp;

The meeting broke up. I had a separate word
with Freddie about Rachel and Sukie. I wanted to hang on to them but I�d need
some help as things got busier. Freddie agreed to my proposals for Rachel and
for Sukie too. He complained a bit about increasing the overheads but, as I
said, it was basically only food and drink anyway. Their costs were pretty
marginal and the value that we were getting from Rachel�s insights into the
sexualisation programme were worth that alone.�


&nbsp;

The two of them were installed in an office
next to mine. Sukie as a sort of admin / marketing gofer and Rachel doing any
of the research or writing that I needed.

&nbsp;

The first real jobs that I had for the two
of them were mapping out the owners training programme and organising the
buyer�s hospitality event. The buyers took priority � we already had a date for
that.

&nbsp;

Rachel was to script the entertainments.
Sukie would handle the admin. I spent an hour running through my thoughts with
the two of them. In many ways it was just like a hundred events I�d organised
before. Just this time the audience and the products were a bit different.

&nbsp;

Basically the pitch was to give the buyers
a training day that would help them do a better job for their employers. We wanted
to let them have some fun but there had to be some work content as well.
Between the three of us we worked up the programme. Sukie had some useful
thoughts, she�d seen a lot of the American owners and knew the sort of things
they wanted in their purchases. We thought it might be interesting to get Elly
to do a short talk on contractual issues and we wanted to pull together a short
documentary like video on the collection and preparation process but apart from
that the idea was just to give them the opportunity to get some food and drink
inside themselves and to enjoy some of the product.

&nbsp;

I knew Rachel could write the video script.
She�d already developed a rough story-board covering intelligence gathering, a
surveillance project, collection, basic orientation and preparation. The brief
was to focus in on intelligence and surveillance because it was those phases
that most affected out ability to give warranties or provide other reassurances
in supply agreements. In the end I think she did a pretty good �job, pulling together some existing material
that the research teams had collected, some video footage shot on a snatch as a
training aid for Harry, some of the CCTV footage from inside the prep centre
and some new material shot specially for the video. She even volunteered to do
the voice over herself.

&nbsp;

The three of us had fallen into a work and
life routine that seemed to suit all three of us. Sukie was happy to look after
running the apartment, she did most of the cooking and cleaning. Rachel was
still spending part of her time reinforcing her sexualisation programme but she
and Sukie had developed a very close relationship that was as much emotional as
it was physical. Although both the girls were slaves as far as the organisation
was concerned, when the three of us were alone together we worked or played as
the mood took us or the business required, a delightful combination of labour
and lust.

&nbsp;

The girls wore their collars, of course,
and shackles whenever they were outside the apartment but, apart from that, we
lived what looked like a normal existence for three people sharing a flat and
their workplace. 

&nbsp;

Even Tricia started to look as though she
was accepting the situation. We�d been chatting one evening and she�d even got
as far as apologising.

&nbsp;

�You know, I think I might have seemed a
bit single minded over some of this stuff,� she said. We�d met up for a drink
in the riverside bar. We were at one of the tables, Harry was at the bar trying
to renew his acquaintance (again) with the bar maid. �And I�m sorry if it
looked like I was jealous about your writer or Sukie. I guess you just had to
do all that for the job and if I�m so all fired up by mine I shouldn�t complain
if you get caught up in yours.�

&nbsp;

I shrugged my shoulders. �Well maybe, but I
don�t blame you for getting hacked off. I wasn�t very straight with you about
things.�

&nbsp;

�No it�s OK. I mean what man wouldn�t like
having two women on tap. Especially when one of them is set up to get friendly
at the click of a finger.�

&nbsp;

As apologies went it wasn�t actually a
really good one but I didn�t want to push things further. �I guess so. It�s not
quite like that with Rachel, though.�

&nbsp;

�No? I thought that was how the programme
worked. Just like Pavlov and his dogs, except when you ring the bell with her
it�s not her mouth that starts dribbling.� She gave a laugh that I guessed was
meant to convince me that she was joking. Somehow I didn�t really believe it.

&nbsp;

�It�s a bit more complicated than that,
Tricia,� I said, �but I can see it might look like that.� 

&nbsp;

�Don�t you find it a bit creepy, though?
Knowing she�s been conditioned to behave like she does? I always had you down
as someone that liked his women a bit more independent minded.� 

&nbsp;

It was obvious that Tricia was including
herself in that. �Sure,� I said �but don�t confuse submission with a lack of
independent thought. If you get to know Sukie or Rachel you�ll see there�s no
lack of that. They just go at their lives in a different way.� The conversation
was spiralling down. I could see us ending up throwing things at one another if
I didn�t change the subject. �How are you getting on with persuading Harry to
let you take a lead on a job?�

&nbsp;

Tricia was pleased for the chance to talk
about her favourite subject. �All right, I think,� she said looking furtively
across the bar. Harry was still chatting happily to the bar maid. �I mean at
least we�ve agreed a series of things I�ve got to do to get to a position where
he�ll be happy for me to take the lead. Plus he�s get me involved with some of
the research side. I think he�s happy enough with my field work, it�s just the
planning that he�s not so convinced about, that, and the coordination of the
various members of the team. I guess it�s fair enough but it�s pretty
frustrating. I know I can do just as good a job as Eva or any of the men but I
suppose I�ve just got to go on working at it.� While Tricia carried on chatting
about her problems, my thoughts were drifting back to Sukie and Rachel. I could
see the clock behind the bar over Tricia�s shoulder. Seven o�clock.
Rachel would be starting her evening exercise sessions. I could imagine her
sliding on to the frame, taking the dildos willingly with a smile and setting
to with a dedication. Perhaps Sukie was with her offering encouragement. They�d
tell me about it when I got back to the flat.�
�� or alternatively I could just tell him to stick his head as far up
his arse as he can manage!�� 

&nbsp;

I was suddenly aware that Tricia�s tone had
changed. �What?�

&nbsp;

�You might at least pretend to listen a bit
better than that.�

&nbsp;

�Sorry, sure, look I can understand it�s
frustrating but you�ll persuade him.� Tricia didn�t look convinced by what I
was saying. She believed that she could do it anyway. I just thought she needed
to grit her teeth and get on with the hard work. Whether that was the answer or
not, bitching to me about it wouldn�t help and I was pretty sure she wasn�t
looking for advice.

&nbsp;

That�s when my mobile went off. It was from
one of the guards at the Centre. Rachel had had a relapse. It looked like
another anaphylactic episode. The doctor was with her.

Chapter 57 : Picking Up For Steve

&nbsp;

Tricia hadn�t looked too pleased that I was
going to dash back to the Prep Centre but what did she expect? It was one of
the longest drives of my life. I had the mobile on all the way but no one
called. I was driving as fast as I could without wanting to attract attention
from the law � this was no time to be having to explain why I was speeding.

&nbsp;

I dashed into the Centre and made for the
Doc�s office. Her stressed and haggard look didn�t give me any encouragement.

&nbsp;

�How is she?� I asked. �Rachel, how is
she?�

&nbsp;

�I don�t know. Maybe OK, maybe not. She had
another attack.�

&nbsp;

�What do you mean,
another attack? The first one wasn�t real! Remember? It was a set up.�

&nbsp;

�Sure, I remember. Well this wasn�t a set
up, this was for real.�

&nbsp;

�Are you sure?�

&nbsp;

�Mmm,� she
nodded. �Look, it�s probably just as well we faked the first one. The same
guard was on duty. He called me straight away. �She�s had another one,� he
said, �one of those anorexic shocks. Just like last time.� I was puzzled. I ran
down there anyway, half expecting it to be some piece of faking; though how
that could be after all the programme work she�d done I didn�t know. He was
right it was real. Luckily I had my needles and the adrenaline. She was lying
on the floor just like before. There was a plate on the floor where she�d
dropped it. Walnut cake. Sukie
was sitting on the bed sobbing, saying she�d just made it as a treat, she
thought she�d love it. That she�d never guessed.�

&nbsp;

�But you got the adrenaline in her? So
she�s OK?�

&nbsp;

�Maybe?�

&nbsp;

�Why only maybe?�

&nbsp;

�I don�t know if I was quick enough. It�s
not an infallible cure. We have to replace the fluids, deal with the shock
She�s still unconscious. There could be brain damage, I don�t know if I got the
oxygen into her quickly enough. Especially after all we�ve been putting her
through. I don�t know what state she was in, how resilient she was.�

&nbsp;

�Can I see her?�

&nbsp;

The Doc shook her head. �Not for a while,�
she said, �I�d really like her not to be disturbed. And I want to get her to
recover from this attack as well as she did from the last one. Only this time
it�s going to be more difficult.�

&nbsp;

�How�s Sukie?�

&nbsp;

�I�m not sure. She was very upset. I�ve not
seen her since we brought Rachel up here.�

&nbsp;

If I couldn�t be with Rachel then Sukie was the one that needed me most. Actually even if I
could have been with Rachel I was probably more use to Sukie.
I went down to the apartment to find her.

&nbsp;

She was still sitting where the Doc had
said she�d left her, staring blankly ahead. I sat down beside her. �It�s all
right, Sukie,� I said as comfortingly as I could,
�I�m sure she�ll be all right. The Doc got to her in good time.�

&nbsp;

She seemed not to notice what I was saying.
�I made it for her. She�d finished the script. For the video.
It was a treat. She was so happy, with her programme, so happy with her
writing. She just grabbed her throat and fell. Down there.� She pointed to the
floor. �She never said she couldn�t eat it. I didn�t know.�

&nbsp;

�Of course not Sukie. She probably didn�t
know herself. It can happen without warning. With things you�ve eaten before.
She�ll be OK.� I reached out towards her and took her in my arms. She didn�t
cry, she just sat there hanging on to me as though her
life depended on it.

&nbsp;

I sat with her all night until finally,
about dawn, she fell asleep. I laid her back on the couch and covered her with
a blanket before leaving to find out what the Doc had to say. Her advice was to
wait. Rachel had had a quiet night. That was probably as good as it got at that
stage. The Doc still wasn�t letting me see her. I went and found some coffee. I
felt like shit.

&nbsp;

The Doc found me later that morning asleep
in one of the chairs in the canteen, a half empty cup of coffee on the table
beside me. Things were looking better she said. I looked at my watch, I�d
missed out on the briefing session for the lift that was going on right then.
It didn�t seem to matter. 

&nbsp;

It felt like it had been a long time since
I�d kicked off the project for Steve Glennis but
finally we were making some progress. Research had done their work profiling
the possible candidates. As I�d thought, their favourite was Lady Angela Marchmont too. Now the snatch team was out on the job. 

&nbsp;

I made my way over to the briefing room to
wait for some news.

&nbsp;

I looked up at the wall. The pictures,
plans and diagrammes that had been used to brief the
snatch team were still there, pinned to the large cork panel that stretched
along one side of the room. The architectural model of Marchmont
Hall, constructed from the helpfully detailed plan found in the hall�s guide
book, �Marchmont Hall � A Regency Masterpiece� �
stood on the table in the centre.

&nbsp;

In the middle of the cork panel was a large
grainy photograph of the target, the twenty seven year old heiress to the Marchmont titles and estate. Around it were other
photographs, some clipped from a recent article in �Hello!� magazine. �Wild
Child or Lady of the Manor?� said the headline, �Lady Marchmont
talks to us in her delightful home.� The pictures, part fashion plates, part
picture post cards showed an elegantly dressed Lady Angela, draped across the
furniture in the great gallery of the Hall, surrounded by its famous paintings.
One, in contrast, showed the other side of Lady Angela, clad in tight leathers
she sat astride the powerful motorbike that she was famed for riding at high
speed through the lanes between Marchmont Hall and
her flat in London.��� 

&nbsp;

The Marchmont
collection of paintings was providing the cover for the snatch team. They would
be arriving at the Hall at this very moment - a group of fine art assessors
from the National Gallery, anxious to see whether the contents of the Marchmont galleries would qualify for a National Heritage
Grant. As assessors of course they would be taking the greatest of care not to
contaminate the pictures in any way while they examined them closely. As a
result, Harry had said, this was a job where you can turn up legitimately
wearing latex gloves. Training the team had been a time consuming exercise, not
many of Harry�s squad had much of an idea about art, much less the finer points
of Flemish seventeenth century genre painting. However after some intensive
cramming at least they could tell the difference between a Rubens and a
Picasso.

&nbsp;

They�d worked out a cover story for her
disappearance. Even the British police tend to sit up and take notice when one
of the aristocracy goes missing. There would be a
ransom demand; lots of threats from the kidnappers and plaintiff appeals from
her ladyship,� Whether
or not the ransom got paid was pretty irrelevant but when she wasn�t released
it would look like a kidnap that had gone wrong.



However, it wasn�t to be. Harry came
storming back into the briefing room two hours later with a severe sense of
humour failure. Two cock ups, he bellowed, two cock ups on one job.

&nbsp;

�What went wrong?� I said.

&nbsp;

�Well it�s not so much that we did anything
wrong but the target wasn�t there. Lady Angela�s butler most
apologetic. Terribly nice chap. Awfully sorry
we�d been inconvenienced. Certain that Lady A must not have realised we were
coming. Gone off to Switzerland. Only that morning. Quite suddenly.
Off for a week. Heard the snow was good and was off. Hopped
on the Triumph. Off to Heathrow. Creature of impulse.
Apparently.�

&nbsp;

�Harry have you
given up using pronouns? And anyway, you said two cock ups.�

&nbsp;

�Sorry. It was talking to that butler. One
cock up was no target; the other was that when the Butler said to call
for an appointment in a week or so he also said it would be better if both
groups of assessors were to come together, the other team had been earlier that
afternoon.�

&nbsp;

�You didn�t have two teams on the job did
you?

&nbsp;

�No. I can only imagine that we came up
with such a plausible snatch arrangement that the real thing was actually going
on as well. I think we�ll have to stand down that whole idea.�

&nbsp;

�Well, I don�t really want to wait too long
anyway if we can avoid it. Steve�s keen to get a driver in place as soon as he
can and Lady A is going to need quite a bit of orientation. Can�t we set
something up in Switzerland? What�s she going there for anyway?�

&nbsp;

�Luge�

&nbsp;

�Luge?� I said, in ignorance. �Pistol shooting?�

&nbsp;

�No, that�s Luger,�
Harry said, �Luge. It�s a sort of toboggan. She�s
going to try to get a slide on the Cresta Run.� 

&nbsp;

�Is that difficult?�

&nbsp;

�It�s difficult to do well, or rather
quickly, and come off at the bottom with all your bones intact. Plus of course
her ladyship has two important limitations when it comes to sliding the Cresta.� 

&nbsp;

�And they are?�

&nbsp;

�Her tits,� Harry laughed. �The Cresta was closed to women in 1929. The men won�t let the
girls play on their pitch. You�d have thought they�d make an exception for the luge.�

&nbsp;

�How come?� I was getting mildly irritated by Harry�s evident advance
knowledge.

&nbsp;

�They go down on their backs.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, very droll,� I said. �So how�s is Lady
A going to do it?�

&nbsp;

�I don�t know, but knowing her she�ll find
a way. Oh well, if it means a trip to some expensive hotel in St Moritz, I guess
we�ll just have to grin and bear it.�

&nbsp;

I wasn�t keen to leave Rachel but I was
worried about this job - Freddie had been very keen that we get Steve�s
collection sorted after all the time it had taken, and I guess I was a bit
twitchy after the meeting we�d all had. The Doc said there wasn�t anything I
could do for Rachel for at least forty eight hours. Sukie
seemed to have withdrawn completely inside herself � I couldn�t get more than a
monosyllabic response to anything. I told her I�d be away for two days. She
nodded. I could see she didn�t care. 

&nbsp;

That evening I found myself with the whole
team in Switzerland. The hotel was comfortable but we didn�t have any time to enjoy its
comforts. We couldn�t afford to waste time. We didn�t want her wandering off
again. 

&nbsp;

Harry had found out that she�d be using a
practice run on the other side of the valley the next morning. He�d set up the
collection with the team�s usual, careful attention to detail. 

�� 

�Now this is where you get to watch some
professionals in action,� Harry said confidently, passing me a pair of
binoculars. �Her ladyship will do her little run down the course. She�ll step
out through the timing hut you can see and as she does so, two of our lot will
be there to suggest in quite a firm way that she accompanies them for a ride of
a different kind. We�ll catch up with them all back at the rendezvous. Ah there
she is now.�

&nbsp;

I swung my binoculars to the top of the
run. Sure enough, Lady Marchmont was standing talking
to a couple of others. Even from this distance she looked stunning. She was
wearing a skin tight body suit of some shimmering fabric in an iridescent
black. Her hair shone in the alpine sun as she talked animatedly with the
others. She was holding her helmet in one hand. The luge
lay on the snow beside her feet. The others headed off as she made herself
ready for her run, scoping her hair up and putting on her helmet.

&nbsp;

She took a few moments, evidently sizing up
the run before she launched herself down the track and laid back, her helmet
only inches from the pounding ice. The luge wound
around the series of tightly banked bends, running ever faster. I watched as
she came into a slower, straight section but as I did so my view was obscured
by a cloud of snow.

&nbsp;

�Hey,� called Harry, �what�s going on?� I
swung my binoculars first left then right and saw a snow clearing machine
pumping a great plume of snow that was drifting across the track. As I brought
my binoculars back down to the track, I saw her Ladyship�s luge
come bouncing down, empty. It scittered
down the remainder of the run, bouncing off the track on the final sharp bend.
�Where the hell is she?� bellowed Harry to no one in particular. 

&nbsp;

The cloud of snow from the snow blower
started to settle. As it did so we saw two figures skiing with a stretcher
between them. They swept around a mound of snow. Moments later from behind the
mound, an all white Allouette helicopter, with red
crosses on the side, lifted off. Harry watched it fly away down the valley with
a furious look on his face.

&nbsp;

�That was lucky,� I said, �those medics
being there. She must have had a nasty crash.�

&nbsp;

�Lucky, nothing,� said Harry. �That was no
accident and they were no medics. Lady Marchmont�s
been kidnapped. The only problem is that it wasn�t by us.�

&nbsp;

Not surprisingly, Freddie was furious. It
was bad enough having this happen, the fact that he was in� the middle of interviews for the sales
manager role � a charade he resented because he�d already decided who he
thought would be best for the job � didn�t improve his mood.

&nbsp;

�Nobody picks up our targets under our
noses. Get it sorted out will you,� he�d bellowed as we�d spoken to him on a
conference call later that day. �Harry, I�ll get Elly
to go through with you and Rick what you think has gone wrong this time.� Harry
and I looked at each other.� He obviously
wasn�t looking forward to that conversation and after what Clegg had said to
all of us following the Brian business neither of us liked to think what might
happen if we didn�t succeed. 

&nbsp;

For me it was just another complication.
I�d tried to talk to the Doc about Rachel but I hadn�t been able to reach her. Sukie hadn�t been there either.

&nbsp;

Chapter 58 : Hospital Visit 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Harry sat on the hillside munching on a ham
roll. To anyone passing by we looked like a couple of back packers out for a
hike. Harry put down his food and picked up the binoculars. The grounds of the
hospital lay almost directly below us, clearly visible through a gap in the
pine trees. He seemed remarkably relaxed given the strength of the telephone
call he�d had with Elly. At one point he�d been
holding the phone a foot from his ear. In the end though she�d been content to
let Harry get on with it.

&nbsp;

�She�s done this stuff,� Harry had said.
�She knows you can�t cover every base although she did suggest that we might
have guessed something was wrong from the debacle at Marchmont
Hall, which is fair enough.�

&nbsp;

�How�s Freddie,� I said. �He didn�t seem
himself when we all got together last week.�

&nbsp;

�Bogged down in admin and
irrelevancies as he calls it. He�s got some
problems with one of the other businesses which he can�t hand off. They�ve kept
him out of touch with our stuff and he doesn�t like it. Talking to Elly, he�d much rather be out on operations or running a
few accounts.��� 

&nbsp;

Harry swept the binoculars across the view
before bringing them back to the hospital. �Yepp,
he�d much rather be here. That,� he said, �is what I�m interested in.� He
passed the binoculars to me and gestured to a small outbuilding about 50 metres
from the main hospital block. 

&nbsp;

I looked myself. There didn�t seem to be
anything to distinguish it from any of the other half dozen or so buildings
around the complex.� �I�m not sure what
I�m looking for,� I said handing the binoculars back.

&nbsp;

�It�s in the right place,� said Harry
taking them and peering down again. �The lads have scoped it out and its definitely being used for something illegitimate. It�s
what we�d use but we need a better indication than� Hang on.� He sat up still
looking through the binoculars. I could see a figure moving across the yard
between the hospital and the outbuilding. The figure was a woman, I could tell that
much from where I was. All in white, presumably one of the
nurses. She looked as if she was carrying something. She stopped at the
door and after a short pause went in. �That�s good enough for me,� said Harry.
�That�s where we�ll find her ladyship.�

&nbsp;

�Harry,� I said, �I�m happy to bow to your
judgement but I imagine there plenty of nurses going backwards and forwards
between the hospital and the other buildings.�

&nbsp;

�You didn�t see it, did you? Before she
went in?�

&nbsp;

�I saw she stopped but that�s about it.
You�re the one with the binoculars.�

&nbsp;

�Well, it was a nurse all right. Carrying a tray with a meal on it.�

&nbsp;

�It�s lunch time, Harry.�

&nbsp;

�Sure, but why do you suppose she stopped
to put her mask on before she went into the building?� I saw what he meant.

&nbsp;

The worst possible thing if you are running
an operation like the Hospital, or the Prep Centre come to that, is to get
locked in to too much of a routine. But I guess with the Swiss, clockwork is
what you�d expect. Every two hours a nurse would come across to the outbuilding
and put on her mask and go through the door. A few minutes later another one
would leave. They were on turn and turn about. Nobody else seemed ot be taking much interest. It
didn�t take too much thought to work out how we were going to get in. 

&nbsp;

There was Harry, two heavies and me. We
waited until dusk. One of the heavies, grabbed the
nurse as she opened the door. The other was through the door ready to deal with
the nurse that was already inside. By the time I�d followed Harry through the
door. One nurse was struggling in the arms of the first heavy, trying to breath
with one of his arms locked around her chest and one hand across her mouth. The
other, sitting beside her captive�s bed, still wearing her medical mask, was
staring at the barrel of our other heavy�s pistol. 

&nbsp;

Angela Marchmont
was on the bed, swathed from head to foot in bandages like an Egyptian mummy
she couldn�t move but she was able to see what was happening and put up a
spirited mmmphing of welcome from behind the strapping
that covered her mouth. Harry walked across to her. �We�ll soon have you out of
here, your Ladyship,� he said. You could see the relief in her eyes. It was a
shame that her rescue wasn�t going to turn out quite like she was expecting.�� 

&nbsp;

We tied the two nurses up, gagged them, and
dumped them on the bed. That�s the great thing about hospitals, plenty of
bandages and sticky tape around the place. They were wriggling and squealing
quite a bit but I guess that was as much because of what their paymasters would
be saying to them later when they found that her Ladyship was missing. We
lifted Lady M onto a wheeled trolley and got her out of the building. Her
captors might have been efficient at collecting her but security around the
hospital was rotten. Two others of our team drove an ambulance in and around to
where we were. We loaded her up and were on our way in moments. Nobody seemed
bothered. Lady M seemed to think we should be letting her out of her bandages.
We weren�t convinced that was of any value. She started struggling around where
she was laid out on the bench of the ambulance. Harry slipped a hypodermic
needle into her arm and gave her a shot of sedative. It calmed her down quite
quickly. Now we just had to get her back to the UK.

&nbsp;

We got as far as the airport. We had a
DH104 Dove waiting for us, one of the old Flying Doctor aircraft, ancient but
robust. Harry drove the ambulance into the hangar. As he and I got out, pistol
shots rang out, flattening the ambulance�s tyres. Four heavies emerged from
behind the Dove. They seemed to be encouraging us to surrender our cargo. I
could see that Harry was sizing up the options. I�m no professional but none of
them looked good to me.

&nbsp;

Then I heard Freddie�s voice ring out. �I�m
not sure that you have this situation quite as much under control as you think,
Constanza.� 

&nbsp;

A dark haired woman emerged from the Dove,
clutching one of Harry�s operatives against her as a shield and holding a gun
to her head. 

&nbsp;

�I think we both need to sit down and have
a talk.� I followed the sound of Freddie�s voice. He was standing on a gantry
at the end of the hangar with three of our heavies all armed with machine
pistols and another woman held at gunpoint. �It�s really not a great idea if we
let off firearms with all this aviation fuel around and I think we both might
end up losing more than we gain.��� 

&nbsp;

�Can I trust you, Clegg?� the woman from
the plane called.

&nbsp;

�No, of course not. Any more than I can trust you. All we can
do is to trust the other to act in their own best
interests. So why don�t we talk about that.�

&nbsp;

As a gesture of conciliation, Clegg came
down from the gantry. The situation unwound slowly. Constanza
let her captive go; Clegg released his. The heavies contrived to put their guns
on safety simultaneously. Harry and I relaxed a bit. I was glad. I�d never
fancied my chances in the middle of a Matrix style exchange of fire. I wasn�t
sure I could move that slowly.

&nbsp;

�Your plane or mine?� asked Clegg.

&nbsp;

�Let�s use mine,� said Constanza,
gesturing to a Myst�re
that stood near the door to the hangar. �We can leave her ladyship in the
ambulance until we�ve decided what�s happening.� Harry and I followed Clegg and
Constanza onto the �plane.���� 

&nbsp;

All four of us sat around the board table
that took up most of the forward cabin of the Myst�re. �We might as well be
civilised about this,� said Constanza, pressing a
button on the table. �I assume you gentlemen would like a drink.� Clegg nodded
and we concurred.

&nbsp;

An oriental looking girl appeared. Clad in
a tight fitting grey silk cheungsam she looked
slightly familiar. Constanza invited us to order
drinks and the girl bowed and took her leave. It was only when she returned
carrying the loaded tray that I realised she reminded me of Rebecca. I watched
her closely. She gave no indication of recognition.

&nbsp;

As she left, Constanza
turned to me. �Have you met that slave girl before?� she asked.

&nbsp;

�I don�t think so,� I said. �She looks very
like a girl we sold as a flight attendant to one of the American buyers. She
went as one of a pair. Maybe nine months ago. But she was Caucasian, not
Asiatic.�

&nbsp;

Constanza laughed. �My surgeon would be flattered to hear you say that. It�s
probably the same girl.� I bought her
from Jesper. Narod Jesper, you know? He�d been using her on his aircraft but
he�s decided to give it up now. He�s taken to the water, bought himself a very
comfortable yacht, claims it�s more relaxing. Less dangerous.
Anyway he had two flight attendants surplus to requirements and I�d just taken
delivery of the Myst�re.
He was keen to sell quickly. I got them cheap. I�d always wanted a Chinese
slave though. Trouble is they�re getting expensive. It�s got worse since the
Brits moved out of Hong Kong too. Still I used the money I�d saved on the purchase to have these
two, let�s say, adjusted to a reasonable facsimile. Slimming
them down was no problem. They both needed surgical breast reduction to get the
body proportions right and facial surgery as well of course. Remodelling around
the eyes was the hardest and most important. Had to make their
noses smaller too. Easiest was the dark wigs. I thought it worked well
but I�m getting a bit bored with them. I�ll probably sell them on soon. Let me
know if you�re interested.�

&nbsp;

�We�re more interested in sorting out our
current collection programme than actually taking your redundant stock off your
hands, Constanza,� Clegg interrupted, a touch
irritably. �Can we get on with it?�

&nbsp;

�Of course, Freddie,� Constanza
apologised.� 

&nbsp;

�Now how are we going to sort out the
question of the unfortunate lady in my ambulance?�

&nbsp;

�Snatched from my
hospital!�

&nbsp;

�Lifted from the middle of an operation we
had set up. Yes, I am sure we can both put up an excellent case for first come
first served. Can I ask why you were targeting her ladyship?�

&nbsp;

�Pure speculation on our part,� Constanza admitted. �My research teams had noticed her as a
possible a while back. She�s over here skiing and tobogganing a lot. Almost an honorary Swiss. Speaks French,
German and English. Plus a genuine milady. There�s a few buyers over in the old eastern that block that
cling to the idea of keeping the aristocracy in their place and would like to
get something like her. And you?�

&nbsp;

�Well she�s down against a specific
commission. I must admit we�d find it embarrassing to have to go back to the
client. He�s very much of the view that she�s the ideal solution to his
requirement. Perhaps I can suggest a compromise.�

&nbsp;

�Suggestions, Freddie, are always
welcomed,� said Constanza.

&nbsp;

Freddie looked thoughtful for a moment.
�Here�s what I propose. We�ll take her ladyship back with us but we�ll provide
you with an equivalent.� British aristo, multi-lingual, physically
attractive of course. We�ll cover the collection costs,
you cover the shipment costs from our UK Prep Centre. We�ll do the prep and
orientation for you at your expense if you like or you can do your own. We�ll
ship to any location in mainland Europe specified by you or your customer. You�ll run whatever cover you
had planned to divert the authorities over her ladyship�s disappearance, we�ll
look after the diversion for whoever we pick up.�

&nbsp;

Constanza looked thoughtful. �Timescale?�

&nbsp;

�One month not including prep if you use
our research.� Harry looked pained. Freddie went on. �If you want to give us
one of your short list then we may have to research again.
Could be longer.��


&nbsp;

�That sounds agreeable. There�s no
particular need for us to have Marchmont
specifically. I�ll trust your taste in women, Clegg. We�d intended to ship from
the UK originally.�

�

�Yes, we know. We nearly trod on the toes
of your team at Marchmont Hall.�

&nbsp;

�Except that she got out
before either of us turned up.�

&nbsp;

�Ha!� said Clegg. �Bloody
product. Can�t rely on it until you�ve got the ropes
on the wrists.� He picked up his glass. �Can I take it we�re agreed?�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� said Constanza.
�In fact I�d like to talk to you about some other UK
pick-ups we need. It might make more sense for you to do them rather than
us.�� 

&nbsp;

�Well let�s talk about it,� said Clegg.
�You�ve got better access to the Eastern European markets than we have. I�m
sure there could be areas for cooperation.�

&nbsp;

Clegg was insufferable on the flight back,
telling Harry how he should get out on operations more but in some ways I was
happy to see it. He always seemed better in the thick of things than working
his way through the office politics. I could see Harry wasn�t happy with the
idea that Freddie might get more involved in the sharp end but at least Freddie
didn�t seem too worried about the things that had gone wrong. Harry had told me
about the post mortem he was planning when we got back. I guessed that Freddie
would let him get on with it.� 

&nbsp;

I was glad things were working out. It
meant I could get back and see how Rachel was.

Chapter 59 : Staples� Diet

&nbsp;

Steve Glennis was
extremely happy when we finally got Lady Marchmont
shipped across to him. As he said, �It�s taken a while but it�s been worth the
wait.� He hadn�t wasted any time in putting her to use. �Had her out on a
trotting rig this afternoon,� he said. She looks pretty good. Gonna take a lot of training of course. She�s got a few
stripes on her buttocks � makes a change for the driver I guess - but she�ll
learn.�

&nbsp;

Rachel was recovering. The Doc finally let
me in to see her. She held my hand tightly when I sat down beside her on the
bed. �It happened again.�

&nbsp;

�I know, Rachel. The doctor thinks she�s
isolated the cause. It was lucky we caught you in time.�

&nbsp;

Rachel nodded quietly. �I was frightened,�
she said. �It was just like the first time, but worse somehow.�

&nbsp;

Yes, I thought, this time it was real.

&nbsp;

�But I�m much better now. I want to get
back to work. It�s so important. I know you need the script and you know I want
to finish it. I thought I could do the voice over. If you�d
like me to? Please let me. I�ll be well enough.�

&nbsp;

�We�ll see.� I wasn�t at all sure. 

&nbsp;

The Doc was looking encouraging. �If you
feel strong enough, Rachel,� she said, �I�m sure we can do that. It will be
better for you to have something to focus on.�

&nbsp;

Rachel smiled and nodded. �How�s Sukie?� she asked.

&nbsp;

�She was very worried about you,� I said.
�She cares a lot for you. She was so sorry - it was her cake that did this.� 

&nbsp;

Rachel nodded slowly. �I didn�t mean to
scare her. Or you. I don�t know why I�ve suddenly
developed this condition. I�ll just have to be careful about what I eat I
guess.�

&nbsp;

�No more walnuts, at least,� said the Doc.
Rachel grinned.� 

&nbsp;

�Now when can I get back to my exercises?
I�m missing them so much? I need to be doing them every day at least. And what
are we doing about the owner�s programme when can we get started on that?�

&nbsp;

�Hey,� I said. �Let�s take the recovery
slowly. Finish the script for the buyer�s event. Do the voice over if you�re
well enough. Start back on exercises when the Doc says it�s OK and we�ll think
about the rest after that. OK?�

&nbsp;

Rachel smiled. �Thank you, Sir,� she said.
�I�m sure that very thing is going to be fine.�

&nbsp;

I thought she was probably right.

&nbsp;

While Rachel recovered we were able to pick
up one of the others on my short list as a substitute for delivery to Constanza. The upper classes are such free-loaders they�re
always easy to entice into somewhere that they can be introduced to a few
lengths of rope and a strip or two of tape. The Honourable Diana Staples was no
exception. Invited to a luncheon with the proposition that there might be an
opportunity for her to act as a celebrity reviewer of restaurants for a new,
up-market, leisure magazine, she jumped at the chance. I guess she figured if
nothing else she�d get a good meal out of it and the chance to get some very
expensive champagne down her neck.

&nbsp;

The only trouble is champagne is one of the
easiest wines in which to conceal something. Let�s say something even more
relaxing than champagne usually is. Especially when you�re
into your second bottle.

&nbsp;

The hotel was very accommodating. Could
they provide a room for our guest to sleep things off? Of course! Would they
make sure she wasn�t disturbed? Naturally. Would they
be happy if we settled the bill for that straight away so that she wouldn�t be
caused any embarrassment later? Without any difficulty.

&nbsp;

The collection team knew she�d be out for
hours. They slipped in and took her out the back way in the early morning. We
were all discussing the problems of running a restaurant like this with the
manager, a perfect alibi if anyone was concerned. 

&nbsp;

As it happened they weren�t. Everyone
assumed that she�d wandered off, still drunk. Of course finding her clothes by
the river did make them all think she�d gone for a late night swim. It wasn�t
really a surprise that nothing was found of her, it being so close to the sea
and everything. And in her state, who knows what might have happened to her? 

&nbsp;

Well we did. And of course she wouldn�t be needing her clothes anytime soon, so it all worked out very
conveniently. Constanza decided she wanted to do her
own prep work, so the Honourable Diana was crated and shipped as quick as you like. 

&nbsp;

It suited Freddie; he doesn�t like leaving
debts outstanding for long.

&nbsp;

The hospitality event for the buyers turned
out OK. We decided to give it a bit of a Kushtian theme with the entertainments
wearing Kushtian headdresses and veils, if nothing else. Probably not very
authentic but I doubt if it mattered given the audience. Certainly our guests
seemed to appreciate it as the almost naked girls brought the food in at dinner
time. We�d started off with Elly�s talk. It was
pretty well received. She even managed a few jokes although I guess purchasing
guys aren�t usually that long on humour. We had a break after that to give them
a chance to mingle with one another and with some of our team. Then it had been
back into the presentation theatre for Rachel�s video.

&nbsp;

She�d done a first rate job. After the
opening titles and the Clegg logo, a caption screen had come up saying�.�This
is the story of how two slaves came to their present position. How Clegg
Enterprises identifies, acquires and prepares its products.� It moved into a
section on research with Rachel providing the commentary. �We build a complete
picture, carefully researching every aspect of their lives.� The film moved on
to a shaky, grainy, black and white shot of women walking in to a rather bland,
modern building. �Fulchester University�,
the caption said, �Women�s Issues Group Meeting�. The camera was obviously held
by somebody walking up to the building, perhaps concealed in a handbag. As the
camera approached the building some of the women turned towards whoever was
carrying the camera to wave and greet them.

&nbsp;

The camera carrier took a seat halfway down
the room. The picture zoomed shakily in to the podium at the front of the room.
A woman in her mid-forties, wearing dungarees and a scarf knotted around her
neck took the stage and waved to the audience. �Welcome Sisters,� she said with
a wave to the audience. �Thank you for turning out to support this meeting.
It�s great to see such a good crowd here. As you know one of our concerns has
been to explore the condition of women in the countries emerging from the
Russian empire and I�m very pleased to be able to welcome distinguished
anthropologist and champion of many feminist causes, Dr Karen Armstrong.� There
was a round of applause as Dr Armstrong took the stage. I was trying to
remember where I�d heard of Armstrong before.

&nbsp;

Dressed comfortably in tan slacks and a
loose sweater she smiled appreciatively, obviously completely at home
presenting to an academic audience. �Dr Armstrong has recently returned from
Kushtia where she has been researching the condition of women in the northern tribes.
Her articles for Anthropology Today and National Geographic have highlighted
the challenges that exist in bringing a more enlightened view of women�s rights
to the country.� I�m sure she has a
fascinating presentation for us�� As Karen stepped up to the rostrum, the
camera swung around to point back up the hall towards the door. Two girls were
arriving late. The camera tracked them, watching as they took their seat a
couple of rows behind where the camera was. The camera zoomed in on each in
turn, both blonde, both in their early twenties, one a little fuller figured
than the other, both smiling and waving to the camera holder, though not, you
thought, to the camera. More hidden camera footage followed. The girls in the
university canteen; sitting outside one of the university buildings; getting
onto bicycles and cycling out of shot.�
There was a shot from the viewpoint of someone working their way through
a darkened office by the light of a flash light, the light stopped on a filing
cabinet drawer, the drawer opened, a gloved hand rummaged through a series of
files and pulled two out, leafing through their contents. �Student Record� each
said on the front cover. The camera lingered on some of the documents, they
were obviously being studied. The files were put back in the drawer and the
drawer closed. The light of the flashlight moved back through the office,
panning across a desk with a notice on it saying �Admissions Secretary�. As it
got to the door it fell on the bound ankles of a woman. The light moved up the
woman showing her laying on the floor, hogtied, gagged and blindfolded,
struggling impotently beside a ransacked office safe as whoever was carrying it
left the office.�� 

&nbsp;

Rachel�s voice returned on the soundtrack.
�� And that research is directed to one thing, an efficient, undetected
collection that does the least possible damage to the goods with the least risk
to ourselves and, of course, our clients.� The shot
dissolved to a country scene, with fields and woods, as the camera turned a
lake came into view. From out of shot, one of the girl�s bicycles came
freewheeling down across the field, with no one to guide it, the bike shot over
a low bank and into the lake sinking quickly beneath the surface. The second
bicycle followed it moments later and the camera panned around to the figures
of the two girls, laying on the grass, their wrists
taped behind them, tape plastered across their faces as a gag. Evidently
distressed, the two were wriggling in an attempt to escape from their bonds. 

&nbsp;

There were a few chortles of appreciation
from the audience as the girls wriggled some more.

&nbsp;

Rachel�s voice over came on again.
�Collection is followed by training, the preparation that makes the new slaves
ready for their new owners.� The view changed to some footage shot in one of
the Prep Centre�s reception rooms. The two girls were sitting bound and gagged
on the floor. A figure appeared and was heard to say, �Good morning, ladies. Please don�t be alarmed. You are perfectly safe here
as long as you do as you are told.� The girls looked puzzled. �Perhaps I should
explain,� the voice said. �You are here to be trained as slaves. You�ll be sold
for the sexual amusement of your new owners.� The girls looked at one another,
wide eyed with disbelief and terror. �But as long as you do as you are told
you�ll be quite safe.� He reached forward stripping off the gags of each girl
in turn and then rolling them over on to their faces to cut the tapes that held
their wrists and ankles.

&nbsp;

�Please let us go,� the first girl said,
�we�ll be no use to you. Please let us go.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, we won�t say anything. Please,� the
second one chimed in, clinging to her friend as the two of them sat on the
floor.

&nbsp;

�You,� the voice said to one of them,
ignoring the girls� pleas. �On your feet.� The girl
looked back uncertain what to do. The man reached towards her with a short
pole, touching her on the ankle. The girl cried in pain and drew her leg
quickly back. �This will give you a shock every time I think you are not
obeying me quickly enough. That was a mild one. Get to your feet!�

&nbsp;

The girl looked more frightened than ever,
clutched her ankle and slowly got to her feet, standing unsteadily with the
pain in her leg.

&nbsp;

�Good,� said the man. �Now undress.� The
girl�s hands flew to her mouth. She shook her head in defiance. The other girl
shouted, �No, we won�t.� and was rewarded with a shock from the wand for her
trouble; obviously a sharper one that threw her back across the room.�� The man turned towards the first girl with
the prod. She shook her head again � this time the look in her eyes was begging
the man to come no closer. She pulled off her sweater to reveal a slim figure
with small breasts. She unbuckled her belt and stepped out of her jeans. �Keep
going,� the man said, gesturing with the pole. She looked down at her companion
sobbing as she pulled off first her bra and then finally her pants. She tried
to cover herself one hand across her crotch the other at her breasts. The man
shook his head and gestured with the pole. She dropped her hands to her sides.

&nbsp;

The audience gave a raucous cheer.

&nbsp;

�By the wall,� the man waved her over with
the pole and turned to her companion. �You next. Do
the same.� She only needed the threat of the pole to encourage her to her feet
and to begin stripping. Slightly more heavily built than her friend with
bigger, fuller breasts with large aureolas, her
nakedness on the video earned a bigger cheer.

&nbsp;

Rachel�s voice returned as the two girls
were herded to one side of the cell, hands on their heads, feet slightly apart.
�And so their training begins. A long process, taking weeks.�
The man kept them under threat of the prod with one hand while running his free
hand over their bodies, feeling their breasts and bellies. �And at the end �
compliant slaves read for use in sexual roles, for domestic tasks or for what
ever purpose their eventual owner desires.�

&nbsp;

I took my cue from the script that Rachel
had provided. As the film flickered to its conclusion, I stepped onto the low
stage, leading two slaves by chains to their neck collars. Each of the two were naked except for their veils and head-dresses. The
eyes, heavily made up, kohl rimmed, lashes long and thick with mascara, peered
out over their veils at the crowd.

&nbsp;

�Ladies and gentlemen,� I said. �You�ve
seen how we acquire and prepare our products. For the rest of the evening, we�d
like you to sample them.� I jerked the veils from the two girls, revealing them
as the girls from the video. The audience cheered again. The girls looked
nervous but did not resist as I led them down into the body of the room. Six
others were brought in at the same time, enough for each of our guest to have
their own slave for a few hours. They all seemed willing to take advantage of
our hospitality and the girl�s availability.

&nbsp;

It was late before the event finished and
our guests retired. Rachel and Sukie were waiting for
me in the suite that Brad had arranged for us. The Doc had been happy enough
with Rachel�s progress to let her come down provided that Sukie
took care of her. Sukie had been grateful for the
chance to be together with her friend again. They had obviously already been
playing together, straps and handcuffs lay on the bed, Sukie was wearing a bright green strap-on that they�d
borrowed from the Sexualisation programme. Rachel was kneeling up on the bed,
naked and smiling. �How did it go? How was the video? Did it work?�

&nbsp;

�It was fine,� I said. �They enjoyed it. It
had the effect we wanted. Feed back from the buyers is that they hadn�t
realised that there was so much in what we did, which is a result as far as
we�re concerned. Well done Rachel, the video made a big difference. But how are
you?�

&nbsp;

�Fine,� she said, �I�m fine. And so is Sukie. Aren�t you?� Sukie nodded
bashfully. Rachel smiled happily and clapped her hands. �And are we going to
play now?�

&nbsp;

�Why not?� I said, �I think I�ve earned some fun today.�� And the three of us fell together.� 

&nbsp;

Chapter 60 : Ownership 101

�Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to this
first session of our training programme.�

&nbsp;

It had fallen to me to kick off the first
of the Slave Owners 101 as it had come to be called. We�d converted a wing of
the Sales Centre to provide some lecture rooms and a couple of rooms for
practical work as well of course as the cells to provide secure accommodation
for our �training aids�. 

&nbsp;

We�d brought together a group of five for
this first session. Freddie had canvassed some of our existing customers and
got them to recommend people. Two of our trainees were members of the family of
existing owners, one had just bought their first slave, the two others were
prospective owners, using the course as a way of seeing how slave owning would
work out for them.

&nbsp;

Rachel had worked on the programme with
some of the guys from Rick�s operations team. We�d put together some sessions
that covered tools of the trade, security, discipline and training, slave
welfare, and (not unnaturally) buying and selling.

&nbsp;

The group were pretty attentive as I ran
through the schedule. All of them looked enthusiastic when I said that we aimed
to spend as little time as possible in the classroom; we wanted them to have as
much practical experience as possible, I said, and there were rooms equipped so
that each of them would have their own one-on-one slave handling sessions.

&nbsp;

We introduced them to the five slaves that
they would be working with, Beth, Ella, Carol, Alice and Sarah too.� It was good to have the two older women and
two youngsters as a mix, plus of course there was a real benefit in having
Sarah who wasn�t as compliant as the other four that had been through the
programme. We aimed to move the slaves around between the students so that
they�d all get a chance to work with each of them.

&nbsp;

Having told them about what we planned to
cover, I handed over to one of Rick�s teams to kick off the session on security.
He started off by writing the on one of the flip charts. �There Are Only Two
Things You Have To Remember About Security.� He turned back to the audience.
�Does anyone want to take a guess?�

&nbsp;

The audience managed to look both blank and
interested. He turned back to the board and started writing again.� �1. You have to be lucky all the time. 2. The
slave only has to be lucky once.� 

&nbsp;

The audience gave a laugh. He launched into
his talk. �This is all about how you make sure that your slaves don�t get lucky,�
he said, �and how you can make sure that you don�t have to be quite as lucky as
you might think.�

&nbsp;

I left them to it. Rachel was waiting when
I got back to the apartment. She had just emerged form the shower. �You just
missed the Doc,� she said.

&nbsp;

�What did she say? Is she happy with how your doing? I mean you seem fine to me now, but��

&nbsp;

�I�m fine,� said Rachel, �completely OK.
She say�s I can go back onto the programme from tonight.� I looked concerned. �It�s fine, Sir, really. This second attack just made me more
determined. I am not going to let anything stand in my way. I�m doing a good
job aren�t I? The buyer�s conference went well, didn�t it? The training course
will be good too, just wait and see.�

&nbsp;

�But do you need to do more of the
programme?�

&nbsp;

�Don�t be silly,� she said chiding. �Of
course. I have to finish the whole thing. You wouldn�t want me to turn around
and whack you again like I did the first time I had the chance, would you?� She
giggled, recalling her escape attempt when she had first been brought to the
centre.

&nbsp;

I smiled ruefully in response, remembering
the lump that the keyboard had raised on the back of my head, not to mention
the embarrassment of being found hogtied with computer cables and a mouse
jammed in my mouth as a gag. �Not at all. You�d better get off to the training
room straight away then. I much prefer the current Rachel.�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� she said gathering up her things.
�So do I.�

&nbsp;

I watched her go. As I turned back I saw
that Sukie had come into the room. I hadn�t heard
her. �She is going to be alright, isn�t she?� Sukie
said.

&nbsp;

I could see she looked worried. I took her
in my arms. �Sukie, I�m sure she�s going to be fine.�
Sukie put her head against my shoulder, her long
black hair spilling down behind my back. �The Doc�s going to do a battery of
allergy sensitivity tests so we�ll know what to look out for in future. And
she�ll have a crash medical kit to keep with her. It wasn�t anything you did.
We were lucky it happened here where the Doc was on hand. Imagine if it had happened
to Rachel somewhere that she was on her own.�

&nbsp;

Sukie sniffed back a tear. She lifted up her head and nodded. �Thank
you,� she said. �Can I do anything for you? Some tea? Or,� she smiled, �some
play?�

&nbsp;

I looked down into her almond eyes. Her
offer was tempting. I ran my hand down the soft smoothness of the hair that
framed her face. �It will have to be tea for now,� I said. �I have to do some
more work for the training course, and I don�t intend to deliver a session on
advanced sexual debauchery with you as a training aid.� 

&nbsp;

Sukie giggled. �We�ll keep that for in here,� she said. �I�ll bring you
some tea.�

&nbsp;

I spent about an hour working to put the
final touches on my session on buying and selling slaves and then went down to
see how the others were getting on.

&nbsp;

The �Introduction to Security� session had
finished and the students were just getting back after a coffee break. They had
evidently found the first session interesting to listen to their chatter as
they returned to the training room. Another of Rick�s team was waiting for
them. On the flip chart at the front of the room. �Bondage Tools � Equipment
Range &amp; Uses�.

&nbsp;

The session started with a question
intended to get the audience thinking. �All right,� said he trainer, �what is
bondage for?�

&nbsp;

This time the students looked truly
bemused. �Well, you�ve got to stop them wandering off haven�t you? I mean we�ve
been through all that in the session on security, haven�t we?�

&nbsp;

�True,� said the instructor, �but is that
all?� He wasn�t getting any real response. �OK,� he said.� �I�d like to suggest to you that there are
three basic roles that bondage will play n your slave-keeping. First is secure
restraint; your point,� he gestured to the student that had made the suggestion.
�But there are two others. The second is punishment. You�ll find that the
threat of punitive restraint can have a significant deterrent value in
maintaining discipline. Would anyone like to try for the third purpose?�

�Well, it�s quite good fun,� the same
student advanced, gaining nods of approval form his colleagues.

&nbsp;

�Absolutely,� said the trainer. �That�s the
third purpose. Amusement. After all, if you are not enjoying the use of your
slaves, there really isn�t a lot of point to it. Don�t ever lose sight of that.�
He wrote the three words � Restraint, Punishment, Pleasure � on the board and
walked over to the door to the room. �Now let�s have a look at a selection of
devices and discuss just how we might use each of them in each of those
scenarios.� He opened the door and led in Beth, Ella, Carol, Alice and Sarah,
each secured and gagged in different ways, the four of them joined one to the
other by chains that linked their clave collars. Apart from the various bondage
devices they were all naked. The trainer brought forward each of the girls in
turn, asking the participants to call out the bondage items that they
recognised.

&nbsp;

�Yes, ball gag, pretty much the general
purpose silencer. �. Good yes, that�s a single arm binder as you say or
sometimes called a bondage sleeve. �. This � yes a discipline collar or corset
collar. This one�s is quite an extreme version the turnbuckle here can be
extended to push the chin up and the head back.�� �� These are bondage mittens and this is a
ring gag � very definitely in the category of punitive restraint, that one I
would say, although you might feel that it has its amusements too.�

&nbsp;

He carried on working along the line of
girls. Even with their conditioning as a result of the programme Beth and Ella
were obviously unhappy with being displayed in this way but as far as the tutor
was concerned this just added to the student�s experience. Beth was wearing a
rubber straight jacket and a hood with large ring shaped panels over the eyes.
The instructor wrestled a reluctant Beth to the front.

&nbsp;

�This hood is particularly effective,� he
said. �You�ll have noticed that it keeps the slave reasonably quiet but a nice
feature is these goggles. They are equipped with two polarised lenses. You can
simply rotate the outer lenses and the slave is immediately rendered unable to
see.� He demonstrated. Beth became even more distressed as the polarised glass
cut off her sight. Her muffled grunts of complaint served only to show that the
instructor had been right about the hood�s gagging qualities. 

&nbsp;

My mobile phone buzzed. I picked it up.
Steve Glennis was calling. I stepped out from the
training room to take the call. �Hi, Steve,� I said.

&nbsp;

�Hi,� he said. �The line was a bit crackly,
I guessed he was calling from the island. Maybe out by the pool or down on the
beach. Suddenly I felt like a holiday. �Just wanted to give you a heads up on
my new driver.�

&nbsp;

I guessed he was talking about Lady Marchmont. �I hope she�s doing all right for you.�

&nbsp;

�Very good, very good. Firstly thanks for
sending over her details and everything. Meant I could get the right gear for
her. She�s looking real cute in this English riding habit, top hat, veil and
everything, hair done up at the back in one of those little nets, looks like
she�d win a mention for turn out in a dressage competition all on her own.�

&nbsp;

�Great,� I said.

&nbsp;

�And when it comes to driving she�s real
aggressive. Drives a rig like her motor bike or one of those bob-sleigh things.
She�s certainly exercising the ponies.�

&nbsp;

Steve was obviously pretty pleased. �Well,
don�t let her wear them out,� I said.

&nbsp;

�No sir! No danger of that. Anyway I just
thought I�d give you a call. I�m gonna take her up to
the house now see if she�s as willing in the bedroom.� I heard a muffled squeal
in the background. Her Ladyship, evidently gagged, was presumably in earshot.
�I�ve suddenly got an urge to push that skirt up over her hips and sink myself
into a British upper class cunt.� There was another
squeal. Lady M was obviously having an impact on Steve, I couldn�t remember him
ever being so crude in the past.

&nbsp;

�Have fun,� I said. He hung up.��

Chapter 61 : True Romance

&nbsp;

I was glad to be able to duck out of the
training course for a while. It was obviously going well but I�ve never seen
myself as a natural teacher. Besides, I�d promised to meet up with Brad.

&nbsp;

The lounge of the Emir�s castle was every
bit as luxurious as I remembered it. I was sat comfortably on one of large
leather sofas when the Emir emerged from another room and strode across to
greet me, hand outstretched.

&nbsp;

�Hey, Larry,� he boomed. �Good to see you. Been too long.�

&nbsp;

I got to my feet and shook his hand. �Yeah,
well, we�ve all been busy and I guess you have too.�

&nbsp;

�Always busy, Larry, always busy. You know
that. Not going to build a trade network over here without plenty of work.� He
sat down in one of the armchairs. I took my place back on the sofa.

&nbsp;

�So, how�s it going? The
trade network?�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, OK. Some of your British companies
don�t seem to have worked out the benefits of exporting yet but we�re getting
there. Too many of them think that Kushtia is some kind of third-world economy
and they might never get paid.�

&nbsp;

�Can�t you do anything to reassure them?�

&nbsp;

�Well it�s difficult. There�s some
government help on credit guarantee but that�s not the tack we�re taking. We�re
spending more effort on convincing them that the risks are worthwhile; that the
benefits outstrip the potential problems. The castle here has been a great help
for that. I�ve got a couple of directors from a defence contractor enjoying a
little Kushtian style hospitality in the castle keep at the moment. The two little
Dutch dykes are putting on a show for them and they�ve got a couple of girls in
traditional Kushtian costume who have been told that
they had better see that these guys have a really good time. That seems to be
helping.�

&nbsp;

I smiled. �I guess that kind of thing
always helps to oil the wheels.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, but it�s more like baby oil than
Brent Crude,� Brad grinned. �It�s an uphill struggle, though. I�m not sure
whether the benefits are enough to let us keep this place open in the long
term.�

&nbsp;

�That would be a shame,� I said.

&nbsp;

Brad shrugged, �Things will work out one
way or another. Don�t worry, I don�t see our
requirements for your products reducing any. Hey and thanks for advice on the
National Geographic article � the fuss died down soon enough apart from one
thing which I want to talk to you about. That�s later though. I wanted to ask
you a favour.�

&nbsp;

�Happy to help if I can,� I said.

&nbsp;

�Well, here�s the thing. Lauren�s
getting married.�

&nbsp;

�Terrific,� I said. �You must be very
proud. I�d like to congratulate her.�

&nbsp;

�Ah, well. That�s a bit of the problem. She
doesn�t actually know yet. The Kushtian way is more, like, well, arranged than
over here. The girl doesn�t get to choose like they do over here. And with me
now working for the Ministry of Trade, I sort of have to do things the
traditional way.�

&nbsp;

I could imagine that Lauren wouldn�t be too
impressed with the idea. �Still,� I said, �I�m told a lot of arranged marriages
work out well. They just have to work at getting to know one another after the
wedding.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, well, I guess so.� Brad seemed
embarrassed by the whole thing. �I mean I didn�t really get to know her mother
until after we were married. Who�d have thought she�d be the whoring, vengeful,
shrew she turned out to be.� He gave a wry smile. �It�s just that Lauren�s
bridegroom-to-be probably wouldn�t have been her first choice. He�s one of the
leaders of the Hill Tribes, from way up in the north eastern highlands. Even in
Kushtia they�re considered a bit, well, backward. He�s an old friend of my father�s
and he has just been asked to become part of the Governing Council.�

&nbsp;

�Good move for you,� I said. �and Lauren will probably think the whole hill top chief
thing incredibly romantic.�

&nbsp;

�Oh yes, it�s a good thing from my
perspective,� Brad responded. �Definitely. But I�m not
sure Lauren will get the romantic bit. He�s quite, he�s not, well, really her
generation. There�s a bit of an age gap.�

&nbsp;

�How bad?�

&nbsp;

�Sixty.�

&nbsp;

�Hey, I know a lot of sixty year old guys.
They�re still able to give a girl a good time. She shouldn�t worry.�

&nbsp;

�No, not sixty years old. A sixty year gap. He�s 78. And after 78
years in the Kushtian highlands you tend to get a bit grizzled.�

&nbsp;

�Hmm, I see what you mean. I�m not sure how
I can help, though.�

&nbsp;

�Well, I�m not sure Lauren�s going to be
real happy with the idea of going back to Kushtia with her new husband. I think
Freddie said you guys have some great transport arrangements for less than
willing travellers.�

&nbsp;

I thought back to my first visit to the
Prep Centre when Rick had shown me the despatch area and the way they used
adapted cargo containers to air-freight product long haul. �Yeah,
sure. We have these high class crates.�

&nbsp;

�Well, I�d like to borrow one. Plus a bit of professional help to get Lauren crated up and safe
for transport. Just, sort of, if things don�t work out
when we tell her about going to Kushtia.�

&nbsp;

�And when does that happen?�

&nbsp;

�Just after we announce
the engagement.�

&nbsp;

From what I�d seen of Lauren I was pretty
sure the crate would be needed. �I�m sure we can help,� I said.

&nbsp;

�Terrific,� said Brad. �Let�s hope we don�t
need it. Now, come and meet my future son-in-law.�

&nbsp;

I hadn�t realised that Lauren�s
husband-to-be was already here but I was happy to follow Brad down to meet him.
He was sitting down in the bar beside the castle�s pool, dividing his attention
between the wide screen TV and the girls swimming and diving in the pool. As he
saw Brad and I approaching he got to his feet. He was
short, bald, and weather beaten with skin the colour and texture of a walnut.
He gave a phlegm laden cough. 

&nbsp;

�Larry, this is Kushnati
Koresh, one of the Kushtian Council elders. Mr Koresh; Larry.� Kushnati Koresh nodded.

&nbsp;

�Mr Koresh, I�m
delighted.� He coughed again and wheezed, leaning forward on his stick. The
three of us sat down. One of the girls brought us some drinks from the bar. It
soon became obvious that Mr Koresh spoke hardly any
English.

&nbsp;

�Are you enjoying your stay here?� I asked,
slowly.

&nbsp;

�Arrgn,� he said
with a smile that showed a mouth half filled with yellowed teeth. I took that
for a �yes�.

&nbsp;

�I expect that the countryside here is
greener than you own home land?�

&nbsp;

�Arrgn,� came the reply with another smile, this time accompanied by
a hearty belch and a smell of soured yak�s milk that took my mind straight back
to roadside food stalls that I�d carefully avoided in Kolin.

&nbsp;

We hadn�t been sat down long when Lauren
appeared, slouching along beside the pool. She peered at the three of us, blew
a bubble of gum and then came over. Ignoring me and Mr Koresh,
she spoke to her father. �I need to borrow the car.�

&nbsp;

�Lauren,� Brad said, �say hello to Mr Koresh and Larry.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah. Sure. Hi. Whatever.� She gave us a perfunctory wave. �Can I get the
car keys?�

&nbsp;

Brad fumbled in his pocket. �They�re in my
jacket. I�ll come and find them.� He got to his feet.

&nbsp;

�Great,� said Lauren. �Sorry to drag you
away from the gimmers.� She smiled at us and stalked
off.

&nbsp;

Brad got up. �What can you do?� He shrugged
his shoulders and followed his daughter.

&nbsp;

Kushnati Koresh watched the two of them go. �Arrgn. Much to manage,� he said
in a heavily accented voice. �But worth it.�

&nbsp;

�I am sure she will make an excellent wife,
Mr Koresh,� I said. 

&nbsp;

�Arrgn�. He reached inside his jacket and pulled a stained brown envelop
from it. He pressed it into my hand and mimed to me that I should open it.

&nbsp;

Inside, written in a carefully printed hand
it said. �My father has asked me to write this as he does not speak English so
well. He would like your help with a problem.� 

&nbsp;

I was getting used to being asked for help.
The letter went on. �As part of an engagement it is usual for the bridegroom to
present the father of the bride with some item of value to show his sound
position and suitability as a husband for the daughter. I think the Emir has a
great enthusiasm for young ladies and losing his daughter will be a blow of
course. I think my gift should go some way to softening that blow. I want you
to find a special girl. Someone that would bring the Emir great pleasure and
compensate for the sadness he will feel in losing his daughter.�

&nbsp;

I thought about the tantrums and temper
that I had seen from Lauren and felt pretty comfortable with the idea of
finding a girl that would offer some compensation. �Leave it with me,� I said,
tucking the paper and the envelop in my pocket. �I�m
sure that a suitable gift can be found.�

&nbsp;

�Arrgn,�
responded Mr Koresh, �

&nbsp;

Brad reappeared �So are you going to be
able to join us for the happy party?� he said. �We�re aiming to confirm the
engagement on the 20th. I hope that you and Mr Clegg will be able to
join us.� 

&nbsp;

�We would be delighted,� I said, but it
didn�t give me much time to come up with Mr Koresh�s
present to the Emir.

&nbsp;

�I�ll get my PA to see to the details.�
Brad pressed a button on a remote control handset. There was a squeal from an
adjacent room and a woman came teetering in on stilt high heels. To my surprise
it wasn�t Cindy. �Neat device, this,� said Brad waving the remote. �Press the
button, she gets a little shock in her knickers and knows to come running.� The
woman looked embarrassed rather than annoyed.

&nbsp;

�Is Cindy not helping out in the office?� I
asked.

&nbsp;

�Nah,� said Brad. �I wanted to talk to you
about that. Would you believe my lord and master back in Kushtia took a fancy
to her and had me ship her out there. Very pleased with her he was but it�s left me short handed. This is one of the girls you
shipped down as part of the domestic staff. Turns out she used to be a PA, so I
switched her for Cindy. She�s not as cute but she�s OK,� The girl looked
embarrassed, �Trouble is, Lauren wanted to carry on having use of Cindy but I
couldn�t fight the top man could I? Letting my daughter have the use of Cindy
had kept Lauren off my back which was sort of handy. Only trouble is Mr Koresh needs a companion while he�s here and he quite liked
the look of Cindy � don�t you?�

&nbsp;

�Arrgn,� said Kushnati Koresh with another
toothy grin and a yak�s milk laden belch.

&nbsp;

�I don�t suppose I could rent that Sarah
girl again, could I?�

&nbsp;

I said I�d see what I could do.

&nbsp;

A squeal of tyres and crunching of gears
from outside indicated that Lauren was on her way. Brad grimaced at the sound
of tortured automobile. �You know, sometimes, I wish that my daughter was a
little more dainty. She spends all her time in jeans
and swears like a long-shore man. But what can you do?�

&nbsp;

As Brad looked towards the window, I wasn�t
certain if he was more worried for his daughter or his car. What I did notice,
sitting in his open briefcase, was a copy of the fetish magazine Second Skin.
On the cover was a picture of a well endowed, well corseted, young lady and the
title �Burlesque Special : Newcomer Hettie Van Voom�. I nodded
towards the picture. �Perhaps you were hoping for something more like that?� I
said.

&nbsp;

�Ain�t she
something!� exclaimed Brad. �A bit different from Lauren, wouldn�t you say?�

&nbsp;

�Hmm,� I agreed, leafing through the
magazine at Brad�s invitation. �I don�t think Lauren could manage those heels
with her trademark slouch.�

&nbsp;

�And that much make-up wouldn�t go well
with her scowl either,� Brad laughed. 

&nbsp;

It was all good fun but now I had a really
good idea for Kushnati�s present. The only trouble
was I wasn�t sure we could get things in line before the 20th. And
Brad still hadn�t told me what the �one thing� was concerning the National
Geographic article.

Chapter 62 : Practical Slave Keeping

&nbsp;

When I got back to
the Prep Centre the Owner�s Course was in its final sessions. I looked in on
one of the practical sessions through the viewing panel. The trainee was
sitting in an armchair as Sarah appeared in the room.

&nbsp;

�You sent for me,
Sir,� she said.

&nbsp;

The trainee looked
uncomfortable. �Yes, err, slave,� he said, �I did.� 

&nbsp;

There was an
uncomfortable silence. 

&nbsp;

�What was it you
wanted, Sir?� Sarah said, trying to be helpful.

&nbsp;

�Err, oh, err, yes,�
he was fumbling with some papers, obviously his notes from the earlier
sessions. �Ah, yes. Naked. Can you take your clothes
off, slave? I want to see you naked.�

&nbsp;

Uncharacteristically,
Sarah looked back blankly at him. I remembered that for some of the sessions
Sarah was supposed to act �difficult�. 

&nbsp;

The trainee seemed
non-plussed by her lack of response. He got to his
feet. �Come on girl, get on with it. Take those clothes off. All
of them. Now!� he blustered. �You�re supposed to do as you are told,
aren�t you? Why won�t you do as I say?�

&nbsp;

Sarah stood still,
staring blankly ahead of herself.

&nbsp;

�What am I supposed
to do to get you to do as you are told?� The man was looking around him in
confusion. �You�re a slave. Do as you are told! Now!� 

&nbsp;

�I don�t want to,
Sir. I don�t like taking my clothes off. It�s not nice of you to ask me.�

&nbsp;

�Not nice! Not NICE!
What�s nice got to do with it? Look just do as you are
told, will you?�

&nbsp;

�No, Sir, I don�t
want to do that.�

&nbsp;

The man sank back
into his seat, holding his head in his hands. �Oh this is hopeless,� he said.
�I�m never going to be able to cope with this.�

&nbsp;

Sarah walked across
and knelt beside him. �Oh, it�s not so difficult,� she said sympathetically.
�Look, you just have to be firmer with the slave, more decisive. Threaten to punish
them. Actually punish them if necessary. You remember the acronym don�t you? GRIP? Get a GRIP?�

&nbsp;

�Oh, yes,� the man
looked more cheerful. �Yes, GRIP. G � Give clear orders, R � Repeat to make
sure they are understood, I � Insist that they are obeyed and threaten if
necessary, P � Punish if they aren�t.� He got to his feet again, pulling
himself up to his full height. �Right, let�s see. You! Get undressed. Now. Straight away. Take off that
blouse immediately and then the skirt. Do it girl!�

&nbsp;

Sarah got to her
feet, seeing that he was being much more decisive than before. She still wasn�t
hurrying to comply though.� 

&nbsp;

�Haven�t you
understood? Let me say it again. Take. Off. Your. Clothes. That�s not complicated is it?�

&nbsp;

�No, Sir, but..�

&nbsp;

�Don�t answer back, I don�t want to hear another word from you until you
are naked. You�ll obey me now,� he said getting into his stride, �and if you
don�t you�ll be beaten.� He pulled a stick from the selection on the wall of
the training room and tapped it on Sarah�s arm. �Come on, unbutton that
blouse.� Sarah still delayed. The tap became a blow and then another on the
other arm. Now Sarah started to work at the buttons of her blouse. �That�s
better,� he said growing in confidence. �Keep going.� Another tap followed as soon
as Sarah showed any sign of slowing. She unfastened the cuffs of the blouse and
pulled it off. �Better,� the man said. �Now the skirt and be quick about it.�
More taps to the arm encouraged Sarah to unfasten the waistband of her skirt
and to unzip it, letting it fall to the floor around her ankles. �That�s not
enough. Bra and panties next. Get on with it.� This
time the blow from the cane was heavier and came down on her thighs.

&nbsp;

�Oww,�
yelped Sarah in genuine pain, �that hurt.�

&nbsp;

�Of course it did,
slave. That�s why you should do as you are told more quickly. Naked, I said and
quickly.� Now Sarah did as she was ordered and was soon standing before the
man, naked except for the collar that she as all slaves in the centre, wore all the time. �That�s better he said. �Now get
over to the wall. Over to the wall. Face it. Hands on your head. That�s right. And stand up straight girl
or you�ll be beaten again. Understand?�

&nbsp;

�Yes,
Sir. Sorry,
Sir.� Said Sarah compliantly, obeying the man at once. 

&nbsp;

As Sarah reached the
wall, the door at the far side of the room opened and one of the trainers came
in. �Well,� he said, �how did that feel?�

&nbsp;

�Ah, well,� said the
man, �not too bad. In the end. Bit of a shaky start, I
suppose but OK once I got the hang of it.�

&nbsp;

�Hmm,� said the
trainer. �Well remember the �get a GRIP� acronym � that will help. OK let�s go
back to the main room now. Slave,� he called across to the naked Sarah, �get
dressed and that will be all for now.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Sir,� she
said, continuing to stand with her hands on her head until they had left the
room. I wandered around so that I would catch her once she had finished
dressing.

&nbsp;

She was still
fastening her blouse as I came into the room. She stopped and looked up. 

&nbsp;

�That�s all right,
Sarah,� I said. �Carry on.� She returned to buttoning her blouse. �How did the
training sessions go?�

&nbsp;

�Umm, OK, I think?
Some of the trainees seem to have caught on quite quickly. Some of the others
are finding it a bit harder.�

&nbsp;

�So I saw.�

&nbsp;

�Oh,� Sarah went on.
�I wanted to thank you.� I looked puzzled. �I think you saved me from being
shipped off to that awful Emir�s castle. I�d be there now if I wasn�t doing
this, wouldn�t I?� I nodded. �Well it�s a relief. I hadn�t meant to upset Harry
but I was concerned about Cindy, even thought she turned out to be horrible to
me about it but I couldn�t have faced going back there with that dreadful
torture chamber and that awful girl Lauren and ��

&nbsp;

Sarah�s monologue
was interrupted by the arrival of one of the guards with a trolley, straps and
gag.

&nbsp;

Sarah giggled. �You
don�t need that. I know my way back to my cell,� she said. 

&nbsp;

The guard looked at
me. I nodded. He grabbed a protesting Sarah and wrestled her onto the trolley
before strapping her on to it. �What�s going on?� she asked as he fastened the
buckles on the straps around her wrists and pulled others across her ankles,
her knees her waist and chest. �Please. What is it?� The guard held up a choice
of gags, the standard ball gag or a thicker plug gag set in a leather strap
that in was held in place by a head harness that locked in place. She was going
to be cross when I told her what was going on. I pointed to the plug and strap
gag.

&nbsp;

By the time that was
fastened in place she was struggling against the straps and grunting animatedly.

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry that you
didn�t enjoy the Castle, Sarah,� I said. �It�s just that you�re going off there
for a while.� Her muffled squeals took on a more intense tone. �Just for rental, nothing permanent.� More squeals. �I�m
sure Lauren won�t be too bad. Or the other girls.�
Sarah was shaking her head. The guard seeing the problem fastened a strap
across her forehead to stop any risk of her hurting herself. Her squeals of
protest didn�t abate. 

&nbsp;

The guard reached
into his pocket and pulled out a sheet of paper. �Transport authorisation,� he
said. �Are you signing it?�

&nbsp;

I nodded, took it
from him, scribbled my autograph on it and handed it back.

&nbsp;

�Thanks,� he said.
�The truck�s waiting.� And with that he wheeled the still protesting Sarah
away.

Chapter 63 : Fetish Un-Fair

&nbsp;

As it happened things
worked out very well on timing for Brad. It
allowed us to collect the present for the Emir just in time and without any of
that difficult business of trying to cover up what you are doing. It�s not
often you can abduct a woman in broad daylight to the applause of a surrounding
crowd.

&nbsp;

Harry�s team set things up. We found out
that Hettie Van Voom was
featuring at a forthcoming fetish fair, helping launch a new range of corsetry
by comp�ring
their catwalk show at the event. I put my �PR expert� hat on. We convinced the
company that they�d get extra attention if a Hettie
was �arrested� at the end of the show and taken away by a group of corset clad dominas. They thought it was an excellent plan. Hettie, they assured us, was a game girl; she�d be happy to
go along with it. We said we could supply the ideal girls to do it. They agreed
to let us have the costumes.

&nbsp;

Tricia, Eva and a couple of others from
Harry�s team weren�t so easy to convince. �We�re going to be wearing WHAT?�
said Tricia, when the idea was first mooted. �This is just some way you and
Harry can get your rocks off, isn�t it?�

&nbsp;

I tried to reassure her but she didn�t
sound as though she really believed me. It was only after Harry had run through
the whole plan and the background to Hettie, the target, that she agreed to do it. 

&nbsp;

I got to the fair in plenty of time. After
my encounters with Kelly it was interesting to see what an industry had sprung
up around the needs and wants of the fetish crowd. I was looking on one stand
at a selection of bondage toys that showed every bit as much ingenuity as some
of the things in Rick�s Prep Centre when I saw her. Kelly was talking
animatedly with a couple of other girls, all three dressed in black PVC
Basques, high heels and stockings as they wandered between the stands. I didn�t
think it was smart to get spotted, given what we had planned for later, so I
slipped away behind the stand, backing into the one place where I could be
confident she wouldn�t find me; the gents washroom.� I gave her a few minutes to get clear and
then emerged. Luckily she�d gone.

&nbsp;

I joined the throng of people around the
stage as the corsetry fashion show was about to start.
The company�s sales manager was doing his initial chat but after only a few
moments he said, �And now ladies, gentlemen, slaves and masters or mistresses,
devotees of the bizarre and fetish enthusiasts, please welcome the sensational Hettie Van Voom!�

&nbsp;

The crowd applauded wildly. Hettie walked out Dressed in a 1950�s style shirt waister dress with a widely flared skirt. It was yellow
with black polka dots. So were the high heeled shoes she wore with it. Her
sunglasses were perched atop a platinum blonde head of hair set rigid in a
lacquered bouffant style. She stepped confidently down the catwalk. Waved to the audience. Looked thoughtful for a moment and
said, �Oh, it�s so hot in here.� The audience cheered.

&nbsp;

With that she stripped off her dress to
even more enthusiastic applause revealing a corset, bra and pants beneath in
the same yellow and black polka dot fabric. Thick suspenders held up fully
fashioned stockings. Her bra was boned and wired to produce both an extravagant
cleavage and an unnaturally conical breast line. She smiled and waved again and
took her place at the podium.

&nbsp;

�Hello everybody,� she called. �It�s so
lovely to see you!�

&nbsp;

The audience called back as one. �Lovely to see you too, Miss Van Voom.�

&nbsp;

Hettie giggled and began her presentation. �A marvellous selection of
corsetry, lingerie and playwear,� she said. �Let�s see the first model�.�

&nbsp;

The show began to the sounds of a series of
fifties pop tracks, the models stepping forward, and showing a range of
exciting corsets in every fabric imaginable. The crowd seemed impressed with
what they saw. Hettie was doing a good job of keeping
the enthusiasm going.

&nbsp;

Finally the show concluded. All six models
were lined up on the catwalk. Hettie was applauding
them and the crowd, proclaiming that she couldn�t wait to try some of the items
modelled for herself.

&nbsp;

It was then that Tricia, Eva and the team
made their appearance. The crowd parted as four masked women clad in black
vinyl cat suits, corsets and stilt heel boots approached the stage. �Hold it
there, please,� called Eva, holding up her hand as she stepped up onto the
platform. The other three took up positions alongside her, legs apart, hands on
hips, confronting the audience. �Are you Miss Hettie
Van Voom?�

&nbsp;

�Why yes,� replied Hettie
feigning shock at the interruption.

&nbsp;

�I am afraid you are under arrest for investigations
relating to crimes against fashion,� Eva responded.

&nbsp;

Hettie, who had been primed about the �arrest�, milked the part for all it
was worth. �Surely not officer. How can it be? I mean,
you only have to look at me.� She flung her arms wide. The crowd cheered,
enjoying the addition to the show.

&nbsp;

�That�s enough Miss Van Voom.
We have reason to believe that the polka dots on your underwear are two
millimetres too large in contravention of the European Union convention on
fashion print design.� The crowd gave a horrified �Oooh!!�

&nbsp;

�Oh no!� exclaimed Hettie,
holding her hands to her mouth.

&nbsp;

�You�ll have to come with us,� said Eva. Hettie tried to run but her high heeled, platform soled
shoes encumbered her even more than the heels on the boots our girls were
wearing. She was seized by Tricia and brought back to the front of the stage.
�Well,� said Eva, �If you won�t come quietly.� On cue, Tricia popped a ball gag
into her mouth. The crowd cheered as she buckled it in place. Hettie was wriggling in a theatrical manner. �And you�ll
have to be restrained.� The crowd cheered again as cuffs were locked around her
wrists. �Ladies,� said Eva to the others, �bring on The Transporter!�


&nbsp;

A trolley was wheeled forward. Hettie was strapped to it. Eva and the others wheeled her
back along the catwalk to cheers and applause. They stood at the curtains
through which the models had appeared and waved to the crowd. Hettie gave an impressive display of gagged protest. They
turned and wheeled her out through the curtains. 

&nbsp;

It was quite some time before anyone
realised that they hadn�t stopped behind the stage but had taken her straight
through the back of the exhibition hall and out onto a truck and even then it
was assumed to be some sort of publicity stunt. By then she was already well on
her way to the Prep Centre, still locked in handcuffs, gagged and strapped to
her trolley.

&nbsp;

Tricia had done a pretty good job, I
thought and I told her so when we got back to the flat. Sometimes giving her a
compliment is a mistake. �It�s a pity Harry doesn�t seem to notice. After all
this time he still won�t let me take a lead role. I�ve been pestering him about
it but all he says is more experience, more
experience.�

&nbsp;

I tried to let the subject drop but Tricia
wasn�t having any of it. �You work with him. Why aren�t you telling him I�m
ready to take a lead.�

&nbsp;

�Tricia, he knows I haven�t the first idea.
You know how effective I am at operations. He only lets me get as involved as I
do if there�s plenty of cover. There�s no chance he�s going to take any notice
of me.�

&nbsp;

�Well, I still think you could ask him.� It
was the nearest I�d seen her come to sulking.

&nbsp;

�Look,� I said, keen to move on, �I�ll
raise it with him but you should be asking him what you need to do in order for
him to let you lead. That�s more likely to have an effect.�

&nbsp;

She gave a hmmphing noise that didn�t communicate much enthusiasm. It
didn�t make for much of an evening.���

Chapter 64 : Back With The Emir

&nbsp;

My mobile rang the following day. It was
Kelly. �Hi,� she said. �I didn�t know you were going to the Fetish Fair. Why
didn�t you say? We could have gone together?�

&nbsp;

I made some, eh? who?
what? noises and said that I
would have called her but I had to be there on business. (Which
was true.) I�d been looking over the hall as a possible venue for an
exhibition that one of my clients was planning. (Which
wasn�t.)

&nbsp;

She asked if I�d seen Hettie�s
�kidnapping�. I didn�t want to tell too many porkies
� besides that might have been where she�d seen me -� so I said, �Sure.�

&nbsp;

�Wasn�t it just a hoot!� said Kelly. �One
of the best things I�ve seen. Those people knew how to put on a show.�

&nbsp;

�I was impressed,� I said, �more elaborate
than any of our games.�

&nbsp;

�Maybe but we still have fun. When are we
getting together again? Assuming that you want to?�

&nbsp;

�Sure, sure,� I said. �I�m sorry I�ve been
busy lately. You know how things are. When are you free?�

&nbsp;

�I�ve got to be down in London for a couple
of nights next week. Tuesday and Wednesday. Maybe we
could meet up?�

&nbsp;

�Mmm, Tuesday�s
good for me,� I said. �Tell you what, text me where you�re staying and I�ll
catch up with you at some point in the evening.�

&nbsp;

�Sound like fun,� she said. �Why do I think
that might not be just you buying me dinner?�

&nbsp;

�Send me a text and you�ll see,� I said.
She laughed and hung up.� I headed off to
find Freddie.

&nbsp;

Freddie and I turned up at the Castle in
plenty of time for the engagement announcement. Hettie
had been brought along too, in the back of a van, in some very special
packaging. We�d also brought a transport case for Lauren in case the Emir
needed it.

&nbsp;

The biggest surprise was that Lauren was
waiting in the lounge dressed in full traditional Kushtian woman�s dress. True
the robe and veil that she wore were goth-black and
the pill box hat appeared to have been fashioned from leather and was decorated
with studs rather than the coins which symbolised an unmarried girl�s dowry,
but at least she was making the effort we thought. There was one incongruous
feature of her appearance, however. From each ear, the trademark white wires of
iPod earphones snaked down to disappear beneath her
robe.

&nbsp;

�Hello, Lauren,� I said. �Nice
to see you. Is your father around?�

&nbsp;

She looked at is as if we had just crawled
out from some stone or other. She didn�t bother to turn down the volume on her iPod. �Whatever,� she said waving her hand in the general
direction of the garden. �He�s out back. Looking for that
rank gimmer. He�s probably mounting a sheep or
looking for a yak to freshen up his breath with.�

&nbsp;

I assumed she was referring to her, still
unknown, intended. Freddie and I took ourselves off in the direction of her
wave.

�

We found Brad in the garden. �Hi,� he said
you haven�t seen Kushnati, have you? There was a
terrible row earlier on with Sarah. She wouldn�t dance for him. He starts in at
her in that dialect of his. I couldn�t understand much of it. Hell, I�ve only
got to chapter five on �Teach Yourself Kushtian� and that only covers the
version spoken in Kolin and the surroundings. She
tries to explain and he isn�t having any. He drags her off. I assume he�s gone
down to the dungeon to give her a taste of some of my toys so I think it�s
better if he gets it out of his system. Anyway, I�ve just been down there and
there�s no sign of them. Lauren said they came through this way but there�s no
sign of them in the garden.�

&nbsp;

We set off in different directions in
search of Kushnati or Sarah or both.

&nbsp;

I went towards the golf course. I was the
first to find them. As I reached the first tee, there were sounds of raised
voices coming from my right somewhere on the approach to the eighteenth green.
As I crossed the green a bizarre sight confronted me in the deep bunker at the
edge of the green. Standing in the base of the bunker clutching a spade and a
jar of some kind was Kushnati. He had a disapproving
scowl on his face. At his feet was all that could be seen of Sarah, her head.
For a moment I thought he had sliced it off with the spade but the lack of
blood and the fact that she was grunting animatedly from behind a ball gag told
me I was wrong. She had been buried up to her neck in the bunker. In deference
to the etiquette of the course, at least Kushnati had
raked the sand where he had been digging; so the man wasn�t a complete
barbarian. 

&nbsp;

There were two of the other slaves
alongside her. Femke Toos
and Greetje Van Bruijn,
both wearing bikinis, were kneeling either side of her
head. Kushnati gestured at the two girls. Femke unfastened Sarah�s gag. Toos
leant forward with a drinking bottle.

&nbsp;

�Oh, thank, you, thank you,� said Sarah
trying to move her head sufficiently to take the drink. She sipped from the
bottle and immediately spat the liquid out. �Oh! No, no, it�s horrible,� she
yelled. Kushnati barked at the two girls urging them
on. Femke grabbed hold of Sarah�s nose and pinched it
shut. Unable to breath Sarah could do no other than gulp at the air and the
drink that Toos was pouring into her mouth. Once the
bottle was empty, Toos jammed the ball gag back into
Sarah�s mouth. Kushnati waved them away. Sarah was
shaking her head in discomfort. I watched as the two girls walked off, laughing
together, no doubt remembering their discomforts in the dungeon as a result of
Sarah�s initial refusal to betray her friend.

&nbsp;

For Kushnati,
Sarah�s discomfort was not yet enough. He upended the contents of the jar he
was holding over her head. From the way that ants, flies, bees and wasps were
immediately swarming about her, I guessed it was honey. I could understand
Sarah�s gagged screams and yells. I thought I�d better fetch Brad.

&nbsp;

I took both him and Clegg back to the
bunker by the eighteenth green. Kushnati was still
there staring down at Sarah who was gasping hysterically into her gag at the
centre of a cloud of flies.

&nbsp;

Brad tried to discuss things with Kushnati using his limited command of Kushtian. A great
deal of gesticulation was going on from both of them. Eventually Kushnati calmed down and he and Brad dug Sarah out. She�d
been tied into a ball, so the hole Kushanti had dug
wasn�t as deep as I�d thought. For all of his sixty eight years, though, he was
obviously fit. 

&nbsp;

Brad called into his mobile phone. Femke and Greetje were sent back
out, this time with a brush and hose. Together they untied Sarah, hosed her
down and brushed the sand from her.� As
they took off her gag, she retched and threw up whatever unpleasant drink, Kushnati had forced down her. Even from where I was
standing I could smell it.

&nbsp;

Brad was still remonstrating with Kushnati but eventually came across to explain. �Sorry
about that guys,� he said. �Just a
bit of a domestic. Sarah refused to dance for him, like I said. I�ve
told him to use the stuff in the dungeon if he needs to but he doesn�t trust
these new fangled things as he calls them. Things like this have been good
enough for his tribe for at least fifteen centuries. He doesn�t see the point
of changing to stuff that�s only five hundred years old as long as the old ways
work.�

&nbsp;

�No problem,� I said. �Is it Freddie?�

&nbsp;

�Hmm. What? Oh, errr, sure,� Freddie responded.
He was obviously miles away, thinking that he really needed to find a way to
talk to Kushnati to see if there were any other ideas
he could pick up from him.

&nbsp;

�I�m surprised at Sarah though, she�s
normally quite obedient and she quite likes dancing, I thought.�

&nbsp;

�It was the snakes,� said Brad. �She didn�t
like the snakes. She�s scared of snakes.�

&nbsp;

�Snakes?� I said.

&nbsp;

�Yes, it�s the Pythork,
a fertility dance from the hill tribes. Some people reckon it comes from the
same roots as the Minoan religion. The dancer performs her dance with two live
snakes and finishes with the �snake� of the person she is performing the dance
for. Kushnati was keen she should perform it for
him.�

&nbsp;

�Ah,� I said.

&nbsp;

�Let�s go back inside,� said Brad. �I�ve
told Sarah to clean herself up and then come and apologise. Properly.
Poskalic,� he said to Kushnati.

&nbsp;

We went back to the pool side bar. The Emir
played the host and served us all drinks. Kushnati�s
humour improved with each one that he downed. 

&nbsp;

Sarah reappeared. Kushnati�s
first instinct to growl was interrupted by his sight of her in the costume of a
court dancer. �Arrgn!� he exclaimed with approval. 

&nbsp;

Sarah stood at the edge of the room. She
wore an elaborate head band around her brow. Coins dangled from it across her
forehead. Her veil was fastened so that it looped down from the head band to
cover her face and then draped down in long folds to be fastened at either side
to heavy bracelets that circled her arms above the elbow.

&nbsp;

Behind the half transparent veil it was
clear that Sarah had followed the convention of the Kalinin�s own
dancers and had gagged herself as a symbol of submission and of preparedness to
accept punishment. She wore her slave collar of course and chains from it ran
to cuffs on either wrist. Her breasts were bare; her pierced nipples carrying
studs from each of which hung a heavy snake pendant. Around her hips was
fastened a broad gilded belt. Her legs were hardly covered by the flimsy gauze
of her harem trousers. Her feet were bare apart from fine silver chains that
linked toe rings to anklets 

&nbsp;

She dropped to her knees and bowed her head
to the floor. �Arrgn,� grunted Kushnati
as she reached squeamishly into the two small round baskets on either side of Kushnati�s feet. She pulled out two small snakes and,
holding them at arms length to either side of her, started to dance. I wasn�t
sure how authentic the dance was. At first it looked more like Ibiza than Kolin
but Kushnati didn�t seem to mind. Even Freddie
watched approvingly. Sarah had obviously learned some belly dancing moves
somewhere; spinning around, thrusting her hips forward and shimmering
her naked stomach. The result was like something out of Shakira�s
�Hips Don�t Lie� video. Plus the snakes of course, though Sarah seemed to have
found a way of blanking them out from her mind. It may not have been as Kushnati�s tribe would have performed it but you couldn�t
fail to appreciate its erotic appeal. Kushnati was
clapping along, providing her with a steady beat to guide her movements.

&nbsp;

Brad leaned across to me as she finished
her dance, falling to her knees and sliding across the floor to lie at Kushnati�s feet. She knelt up and lowered each snake in
turn into its basket. The snakes seemed hapy to be
released. She stretched her hands forward so that they finished in Kushnati�s lap. He grunted with satisfaction and pressed
his own hands down on top of hers making it plain what she was to do. �He seems
to have forgiven her,� Brad smiled as Sarah commenced her attentions on the
third snake.

&nbsp;

�So how are things going for the
engagement?� I asked Brad.

&nbsp;

�Well, Lauren still doesn�t know. But she�s
been very good. You see she�s taken to wearing the chanoosh?�

&nbsp;

�Chanoosh?� said
Freddie.

&nbsp;

�The long gown and veil of the femnyette, a �woman not yet a wife� � that�s basically any
unmarried girl of marriageable age. Kushnati has a
very traditional view of things; nagged her that it was inappropriate for a
high born woman to disport herself in the same way as slaves and concubines. In
the hills only whores uncover their bodies. She got into that outfit a day or
so ago. I think she�s only doing it to get a quiet life. She�s just hoping
he�ll go away and she can have Sarah back. I think she�s quite missing having
her to bully, but then she always did take after her mother.� Brad looked
philosophical. �Still the engagement. Yeah, sure, that�s all fine. Kushnati is happy aren�t you?�

&nbsp;

�Arrgn!� Kushnati concurred enthusiastically grinning toothily and
lifting his glass as Sarah worked away with her hands in his lap.

&nbsp;

�Engagement? Who�s getting engaged?� We
turned around to see the robed and veiled Lauren standing at the back of the
room.

&nbsp;

�Lauren,� said Brad, biting his lip. �I
need to have a talk with you.�

&nbsp;

She looked for a moment at Kushnati�s leering grin and then, realising what was
intended, yelled �No! Noooo!� She ran back into the
house.

&nbsp;

Brad looked tired. �Daughters!� he
exclaimed, shrugging his shoulders. �Can�t live with them, can�t sell them.�

&nbsp;

�She looked pretty upset,� said Freddie,
�in as much as you could tell behind that - what did you call it - chanoosh.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, She will be. I�ll let her cool down
a bit. Sarah, why don�t you go up and help calm her down?�

&nbsp;

Sarah reached up and removed her gag. �Yes,
Emir,� She said obediently. Bowing first at Kushnati,
then ourselves and then Brad, she went of in the direction that Lauren had
taken.

&nbsp;

Kushnati appeared unconcerned. He waved his glass indicating his desire for
another drink if he wasn�t going to have Sarah to amuse him.

&nbsp;

We stayed in the bar drinking with Kushnati for about an hour or so before Brad said. �I�d
better go see how she�s getting along.� He was back moments later and beckoned
to Clegg and myself. Kushnati was well under the
influence. We slipped away, leaving him to doze.

&nbsp;

As we left the bar, Brad hissed, �Now I
really do need your help. It looks like she�s run off.�

&nbsp;

Clegg gave a pained look. �Are you sure?�
he said.

&nbsp;

�I think so,� said Brad. �Her room�s empty.
She isn�t anywhere else around the place.�

&nbsp;

�What does Sarah say?� I asked.

&nbsp;

�I can�t find her either.�

&nbsp;

We followed Brad back up to Lauren�s room.
There didn�t seem to be any sign of her. The chanoosh
had been flung across the bed. The rest of the room was in what I imagined to
be the normal muddle for any teenager. We all heard a quiet moan coming from
Lauren�s wardrobe.

&nbsp;

Brad pulled the door open. Inside Sarah,
still in her dancer�s costume but bound and gagged with strips torn from
Lauren�s bed sheets, was trying to free herself. Together we hauled her from the
cupboard and cut the ties from her wrists and ankles. Brad un-knotted the cloth
that was gagging her. She spat another wad of cloth from her mouth. It was a
pair of panties; Lauren�s I assumed. �Oh, thank you,� she gasped. �It was
Lauren. She attacked me. She put some clothes in a rucksack and pushed me in
here.�

&nbsp;

�Do you know where she�s gone?� Brad was
concerned, though whether for his daughter�s well being or for his own problem
with Kushnati I couldn�t tell. Sarah shook her head
disconsolately. He turned to Freddie. �You have to help me with this,� he said.
�Kushnati will be furious if we can�t go through with
the engagement ceremony.�

&nbsp;

Clegg looked thoughtful. �I hate doing this
sort of off-the-cuff thing but I�ll do what I can,� he said. �Can you say what
she was wearing?� 

&nbsp;

Brad looked down at the discarded chanoosh. �Well,� he said.

&nbsp;

�A pair of white jeans and a dark sort of
khaki tank top.� Sarah chipped in. �She had a grey sweater with her and some
regular denim jeans that she put in her bag and the rucksack - that was a sort
of muddy green colour.� 

&nbsp;

�Thank you, Sarah,� said Freddie, �that�s
most helpful.�

&nbsp;

�Oh!� exclaimed Sarah realising that she
had almost certainly given Freddie essential information that would lead to
Lauren�s recapture. She just hoped no one mentioned to Lauren who had told him.

&nbsp;

Freddie and Brad wandered off, Clegg,
chatting into his mobile phone. I felt a bit spare. Sarah was busily tidying up
the torn up sheets and clearing the muddle left by Lauren. Seeing that the Emir
had gone she turned to me. �Please,� she said, please. You must get me my old
job back. Get Harry to take me back, please.�

&nbsp;

�You know I can�t do that, Sarah,� I said.

&nbsp;

�But it�s awful here. All the other slaves
hate me because of the Cindy thing and the torture room and Lauren treats me
like dirt. Koresh is horrible. I mean he can�t help
being old but he smells so and what�s worse he�s obsessed with sex but he can�t
do anything about it. I had my hands in his lap then and it made no difference.
It�ll be awful if I have to stay with him and Lauren. You have to take me away.
Please!�

&nbsp;

�Sarah, you�re a slave. You have to put up
with it. Harry isn�t going to take you back if the Emir doesn�t want to release
you. If you carry on like this the Emir will have you back in the dungeon for
more training and you�ll find that difficult. I suggest you make the best of
it. Work out how to keep Koresh amused. If you can do
that he�ll be happy and Lauren will be too. Why don�t you go back down to the
bar and see what you can do for him?�

&nbsp;

Sarah looked at me for a moment and then
looked as though she had decided that I was right. �Thank you for your advice,
Sir,� she said. �I shall do just as you suggest.� 

&nbsp;

I watched as she rearranged her costume and
fastened her veil back across her face. She gave a deep curtsy and headed off
back downstairs. She didn�t know her rental to the Emir was going to finish
soon. There didn�t seem to be any point in telling her.

Chapter 65 : Looking For Lauren 

&nbsp;

Harry turned out a small team to go hunting
Lauren. He�d been trying to bring on a new set of �cadets� as he called them.
All girls under twenty, Harry thought they�d be helpful for collecting the
increasing number of eighteen to twenty year olds we were being asked to find.

&nbsp;

Four of them were sent off with a list of
some of the places that the Emir knew Lauren used; a couple of photographs and
Sarah�s description of the way that Lauren was dressed. Harry told them just to
report in when they�d found her but I could tell he wasn�t confident that they
wouldn�t try to pick her up themselves.

&nbsp;

I was with Harry when he got the phone call
saying they�d found her. We hopped into his Land Rover and headed off through
the Worcestershire countryside, following the directions from Harry�s team.

&nbsp;

We turned off the main road into a car park
beside a large metal framed building. �The Music Barn�
the sign said. At two
 o�clock in the afternoon it was deserted.

&nbsp;

A teenage girl, one of Harry�s team I
assumed, skate boarded towards us across the car park. She skidded to a halt
inches from the car, stood on the tail of her board and flipped it up to catch
it in her hands as she dismounted. Harry opened the window on his door. �Yo!� she announced in greeting. Suddenly I was finding it
difficult to remember that I was only about 10 year�s older than she was.

&nbsp;

�So you found her?�

&nbsp;

�Yepp.�

&nbsp;

The new arrival obviously had as broad a
vocabulary as her quarry.

&nbsp;

�You wanna tell
me about it? Or are we just going to applaud the skateboarding?�

&nbsp;

She looked sulky. �She�s around the back.�

&nbsp;

�OK, what do we need to do to pick her up?�

&nbsp;

�Nah, don�t bother. We
done that.�

&nbsp;

�Jaycee, I said just find her. I said don�t
touch her.�

&nbsp;

�She�d have sussed us, the time you took.
We took her easy. That�s what we�re supposed to be for isn�t it?�

&nbsp;

�When I say so. Not just when you feel like it.�

&nbsp;

�Whatever.�

&nbsp;

She must be getting on famously with
Lauren, I thought. Harry looked pensive. �OK, let�s talk about it later. Do we
go with you or are you gonna bring her out here?�

&nbsp;

Jaycee sucked on her teeth and looked back
towards the building. She gestured with her head towards the side of the
building, got back on her skateboard and headed off. We followed in the Land
Rover. Beside the building was a overgrown track and
at the back of that was a derelict brick hut, its windows without glass, its
door hanging loosely from one hinge. Jaycee disappeared inside. Harry backed
the Land Rover up to the hut and we followed her inside.

&nbsp;

Jaycee was waiting for us with two of her
pals. Sitting in the floor, wrists and ankles bound and with a rucksack pulled
down over her head as a hood was a girl I assumed to be Lauren. She was only
wearing one of her two trainers. Harry pointed down at Lauren�s bare foot.
�Loose ends,� he said to Jaycee and her pals. �I�ve told you about that. We
don�t leave loose ends. Where�s the other shoe?� 

&nbsp;

Jaycee laughed and pulled the rucksack
clear of Lauren�s head, showing the other trainer jammed toe first into the poor
girl�s mouth and tied there as a gag. Lauren shook her head trying to dislodge
the shoe but without effect. Her complaints became progressively more excited
and animal like as Harry grinned and congratulated Jaycee and the others.

&nbsp;

Harry and I pulled Lauren to her feet.
Together we picked her up and pushed her into the back of the Land Rover before
wrapping her in a tarpaulin. �Thanks, Jaycee,� said Harry. �Good job.�

&nbsp;

�Fair �nuff,�
said the girl, evidently pleased by the compliment. �Hey is it true we snatched
Hettie Van Voom?�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, sure. Part of the same job.�

&nbsp;

�Excellent!� said Jaycee. �Sorry I missed
that one. She is just sooo cool. Do we get to prep
her?�

&nbsp;

�Sorry, Jaycee, she�s being delivered
today.� Jaycee looked disappointed. Comparing her pale, spotty, complexion,
ratted hair, ripped jeans and cropped t-top with Hettie�s
immaculate appearance she seemed like an unlikely admirer but this business
throws up some strange people. Jaycee and her pals grabbed their skateboards
and piled into the back of the Land Rover around the helpless Lauren. We
dropped them off at the railway station and headed off with Lauren towards the
castle.

&nbsp;

As we drove the Land Rover back, with
Lauren secure in the back under a tarpaulin, I chatted with Harry about Sarah
and her problems. As I suspected he wasn�t interested in doing anything for
her, Cindy was proving to be just as useful. I asked him about Tricia. She�d
been bending my ear about taking a lead role on a collection. Harry was blunt.
�She�ll get to go lead when I think she�s ready. You wouldn�t want any
different would you?�

&nbsp;

�Nuhuh,� I said.
�Your call is good enough for me.� And it was. If Harry didn�t think she was
ready then it wouldn�t be good for the collection and it wouldn�t be good for
Tricia either. Anyway I wasn�t about to put my neck out for her with Harry.

&nbsp;

Lauren started to kick up a fuss in the
back. The trainer gag kept the noise down but it was still irritating. �Fancy
some music?� said Harry. I nodded. He pushed the on switch on the Land Rover�s
CD player. Lead Zeppelin poured out of the speakers. It drowned out Lauren�s
grunting but that was about all that could be said for it. My taste goes more
for Northern Soul.

&nbsp;

We drove up to the Emir�s place. He was
waiting at the door. Harry and I carried Lauren, helpless, kicking and wrapped
in the tarpaulin, inside.

&nbsp;

Brad helped us to get her untied. Even
after we took the gag off her she stayed silent.

&nbsp;

�Lauren, we need to discuss this,� said
Brad. Lauren took no notice. He snipped through the plastic ties around her
ankles and her wrists. Lauren sat on the floor hunched up and scowling at her
father. �Come on,� Brad said, gripping Lauren�s arm and helping her to her
feet. �Let�s go somewhere quieter.� He turned to Harry and me. �Thanks guys,�
he said. �Lauren and I need to chat. Why don�t you get yourselves a beer,
Freddie and Kushnati are in the bar.�

&nbsp;

I spent about half an hour with Kushnati, Clegg, and Harry but it was soon obvious that Kushnati was getting restless waiting for the return of his
fianc�e to be. I agreed to look for Brad and Lauren.

&nbsp;

I bumped into one of Brad�s guards in the
corridor. He said they were down in the dungeon but Brad didn�t want to be
interrupted. I slipped into a gallery that looked down into the dungeon to wait
for an opportunity to get them to come back to the bar. Lauren was over at one
side, swinging her legs under the chair she was sitting on. Brad was dividing
his attention between talking to his daughter and tightening straps that were
holding Femke onto the rack. Alongside them Greetje had been tied to the rim of the great wooden wheel.
Both Femke and Greetje were
moaning in fear. 

&nbsp;

�Why wouldn�t you talk to me?� Brad was
asking his daughter.

&nbsp;

�He�s gross. He�s old and he�s gross. How
could you think I�ll marry him?�

&nbsp;

�Lauren, sometimes it�s a good idea to take
a little bit of pain for a greater good.� Brad turned his attentions to Greetje, tightening her straps. �Like these ladies are
going to discover for tormenting Sarah.�

&nbsp;

�I won�t do it, Dad.�

&nbsp;

�Think about it. You�ll be the wife of a
council member; practically royalty. OK, Kolin isn�t
the greatest place on the planet but you can still get MTV there. You�d have
your own slaves; a councillor�s wife wouldn�t be expected to lift a finger.
Beside�s how long can he live?� Brad tugged on the bar that started to stretch Femke on the rack. �You shouldn�t have been quite so
willing to amuse Mr Koresh, Femke
dear,� he said. �I think you should have come to find me.� Femke
gasped as the rack began to pull against her arms and legs. Brad turned back to
Lauren. �But if you won�t go��

&nbsp;

Lauren watched fascinated as Femke tried to pull against the effects of the rack. Brad
went across to Greetje and started to winch the wheel
she was tied to clear of the floor. Her squeals became louder with each creak
of the winch and clank of the chain. As her belly lifted from the floor and she
took the weight of her body on the straps around her wrists and ankles she gave
out a deep groan.��� 

&nbsp;

��My own slaves?� Lauren asked. �Couldn�t I do that here? I
mean I�m old enough to have my own and you�ve let me use Sarah.�

&nbsp;

�It�s different here, Lauren. Or back in
the States. There�s too many people who think that
sort of thing is primitive and � what did you call Kushnati
� gross. I can only do it because of my diplomatic immunity and a lot of money
and help from Clegg. Even then, I�m not sure we�re going to be able to keep it
going. Sure you could go on borrowing slaves but it would be a long time before
you could really have your own here.� Femke and Greetje were both groaning. Lauren got up from the seat and
wandered across to look at them more closely.

&nbsp;

�But he is gross. I mean the smell. And,
well, in bed?�

&nbsp;

�From what I hear the Emir won�t be
bothering you much in the bedroom. You could probably persuade him to let you
have one of the young tribesmen to keep you amused. He�s happy with the
occasional grope and plenty of beer. And if you had your own slave to divert
him�.�

&nbsp;

�You�d let me have one? As
my own for real slave? Really Dad?�

&nbsp;

Brad leant on the lever of Femke�s rack again, she yelled. Lauren�s eyes were brighter
than ever. �Why not? If it would
help. Not Sarah, though, she�s going back to Clegg. Have one of the
others.� Greetje groaned and wriggled setting the
wheel swinging on its supporting chain.

&nbsp;

�Oh Dad!� Lauren exclaimed and ran forward, throwing her arms around his
neck. She gave him one kiss after another.

&nbsp;

�Hey,� he said. �Am I forgiven then?�

&nbsp;

�I�ll do it,� said Lauren.

&nbsp;

�Kushnati wanted
to go through the formalities today, you know.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, I guessed,� said Lauren. �Well, why
not? Unless you want to play with these some more?�
She gestured at Femke and Greetje.
�Ooo, I couldn�t have these two could I?�

&nbsp;

�Why not?� said Brad. Lauren clapped her
hands in delight. �I�ll get one of the guards to let them down.� Femke and Greetje moaned begging
to be freed but still dreading their fate at the hands of Sarah.

&nbsp;

�Let me get dressed, though,� said Lauren.
�I want to do it properly. I�ve looked it up. I�m supposed to wear a chanoosh. I intend to be a proper Kushtian councillor�s
wife.�

&nbsp;

�That�s wonderful, Lauren,� Brad said. 

&nbsp;

�No problem,� Lauren said with a giggle.
�Have you any idea what some of those ladies get up to?� 

&nbsp;

I headed back to the bar without bothering
Brad. It was obvious that they�d be along shortly. We just had time to get Kushnati�s present for Brad off of the van and stowed in
the next room before Brad reappeared, leading his daughter by the hand. Clad in
her chanoosh, she presented a perfect picture of
Kushtian submissive womanhood with her eyes cast to the floor and her hands
clasped modestly in front of her.

&nbsp;

�Mr Koresh,� Brad
said. �I believe you have something to say.�

&nbsp;

Kushnati got to his feet unsteadily. He�d been drinking consistently for
quite a while. He belched. He spoke carefully, evidently having memorised the
English words. �Emir, I wish to take your daughter as my wife.�

&nbsp;

�Head Koresh,�
Brad responded with equal formality. He brought out a set of ceremonial
manacles joined by a heavy chain. From where I was standing they looked as
though they were made of gold. I later found out that they were. �Take my
daughter as your wife,� he said as he fastened first Laurens� left wrist and
then her right. �Care for her as your favourite horse or hawk.� He took Laurens
hand and brought it together with Kushnati�s gnarled
fingers. �Let everyone here witness that this girl gives no word against this
match.� Lauren could have been gagged beneath the veil of the chanoosh but in fact she wasn�t. 

&nbsp;

She hugged her father and then hugged Kushnati, saying, �I look forward to becoming your wife,
Head Koresh.�

&nbsp;

Kushnati grunted his appreciation. �Your daughter, my wife,� he said. He
turned to Brad. �Emir, please accept this gift as a token of my esteem for your
daughter.� He clapped his hands. Two of Brad�s guards emerged from the next
room pushing a large white box on a trolley. The box was tied with a huge
purple satin ribbon and bow. Brad spoke his thanks to Kushnati
and tugged at the ribbon. It fell loose. Lifting the lid of the box, Brad saw
immediately what was inside. Laid out, full length, and wedged onto the box by
cream, silk-covered, packing was Hettie Van Voom.

&nbsp;

Brad was evidently delighted. �Head Koresh,� he said. �I�m overwhelmed. A
remarkable gift indeed. Thaknarish. Thank you. Thaknarish.� The two guards helped get Hettie
from the box.

Kushnati smiled. �Arrgn,� he said. �Please enjoy
this. Think of it not as losing a daughter but gaining a woman.�

&nbsp;

Hettie was drugged. Not unconscious but with only limited awareness of her
surroundings. She presented a perfect, fetishised,
female image. She wore a purple silk corset that exactly matched the ribbon of
the box, long silk gloves that stretched over her elbows, stilt heeled platform
soled shoes in a glossy patent leather, a narrow velvet band around her throat
and a large ball gag in her mouth; all in the same purple. As she was helped to
her feet, Brad was visibly delighted by what he saw. The corset cinched her
waist, the combination of her well developed breasts and the engineering of the
bra she wore gave her a cleavage that invited close inspection. Her legs, clad
in the finest silk stockings, were made more shapely
by the height of her heels. 

&nbsp;

Freddie, impressed as ever by the
technologies developed by Rick�s team, stepped forward. �Brad,� he said,
�you�ll like this.� He held up a small phial of liquid.� This allows you to use
your new slave as a doll. When she is dosed with this, you can simply position
her as you wish and she will stay in place.� He walked up to Hettie, carefully repositioning her, bending her at the
knees and so her backside stuck out. He moved her arms so that one was above
her head apparently waving while the other pressed a finger to her pursed lips.
She stood motionless, holding the position.

&nbsp;

�Fantastic,� said Brad, �Better &amp;
better.�

&nbsp;

From the ways that Hettie�s
eyes were flickering it was clear that she was aware
of what was happening but had no control over her movements.

&nbsp;

Sarah was watching the proceedings from the
back of the room. She�d been brought in wearing the same costume that she had
worn to dance for Kushnati. �Isn�t it romantic,� she
said to me. �I would never have thought that Lauren would agree to this but it
just goes to show.�

&nbsp;

I grunted in a noncommittal way.

&nbsp;

�I can�t imagine what persuaded her to go
through with this and to go to Kushtia. But I�ll be honest,� she dropped her
voice to a whisper, �I�m not sorry to see her go. I�m not sure who was worse,
her or Kushnati.�

&nbsp;

I didn�t say anything. I was pretty sure
we�d have something disagreeable lined up for her as soon as the engagement
ceremony was finished.

&nbsp;

The Emir and Kushnati
were embracing. Lauren was standing quietly by. She leant across to her father
and whispered something to him. He listened and then beckoned Sarah to join them.
As she reached them he took her wrists and clipped her shackles to her collar.
Unable to use her hands she was helpless to prevent Lauren pulling aside her
Sarah�s veil to allow her to push one of Harry�s gel gags into her mouth. In a
moment the expanding gel had silenced her. I saw Brad explaining something to Kushnati as Lauren clipped a leash to Femke
and Greetje�s collars. Brad and Kushnati
walked towards me together with Lauren dragging her newly acquired slaves. As
they passed me they gave me a pleading look and a gagged moan. Brad beckoned me
to follow. 

&nbsp;

At the back of the house, the transport crates was waiting for Femke and Toos. Beside it there were a pair
of small wooden trestles. As we reached it, Brad took Femke
and bent her forward over the first wooden trestle, clipping a short length of
chain to her collar so that she was held, head down, her backside in the air.
He walked behind her and fastened her ankle cuffs to the legs of the trestle,
fixing her helpless and exposed.

&nbsp;

With Femke fixed
in place, Greetje was treated the same way. Sarah
emerged from the house carrying a small metal bucket on a tripod stand. I
recognised it from the dungeon. From the care she took and the way the air was
shimmering above the bucket, it was obviously hot. As she walked by me I could
see that the bucket contained red hot coals. She put it down beside Femke and went back into the house. �Kushnati,�
Brad was saying. �I know that these girls are to be my wife�s slaves but of
course they must carry your mark as part of your household.�

&nbsp;

Lauren tried to interrupt. �Shouldn�t they
have a mark for me?� Femke was trying to struggle
free from the trestle.

&nbsp;

Kushnati laughed, evidently amused by the girl�s naivety. �No,� said her
father. �It�s all rather complicated, Kushtian laws of
property and all that. Don�t worry about it.���


&nbsp;

Sarah retuned carrying a velvet cushion. As
she got to the group, Brad reached out and picked a long handled device from
the cushion. He plunged the end of it into the bucket of hot coals. The two
Dutch girls, guessing what was about to happen became still more animated in
their attempts to free themselves.

&nbsp;

The gag was not sufficient to silence the
piercing scream as Brad pressed the red hot iron against Femke�s
left buttock. It was loud enough to throw a crowd of rooks into the sky from a
nearby line of trees, cawing in response. The hiss of scorching flesh could
still be heard as the noise of the rooks and Femke�s
gagged whimperings fell away. Brad pulled the brand
away causing Femke to scream again and leaving the
raw pattern of two interlocked K�s, for Kushnati Koresh, etched into her
buttock. The whole thing was repeated with Greetje.
At the end the smell of burnt flesh and the gagged screams of the girls filled
the air around them. Brad tossed the brand back into the bucket of coals and
reached forward to shake Kushnati�s hand.

&nbsp;

�Arrgn� the chief
said in acceptance and unfastened the two from their trestles to lead them
staggering in pain towards the transport crate.�
Kushnati, Lauren, Femke
and Greetje were ready for their journey to Kushtia.
For Femke and Greetje, at
least the sedative they were given for their journey would have eased the pain
of their brands.

&nbsp;

Elly took Sarah to one side. �You�re coming back to the Prep Centre,�
she said. In spite of her gag Sarah�s gratitude was plain. 

&nbsp;

�I�d wait until you get there before you
are too effusive in your thanks,� she said. �We�ve got some interesting
programmes to put you through.� I wasn�t sure how well Sarah would respond but Elly, Freddy and I had agreed that it was probably the best
step for her.� 

&nbsp;

Brad caught up with me before I left.

&nbsp;

�Well, that all seemed to work out,� I
said.

&nbsp;

�Yes, fine, Brad responded. �Thanks.�

&nbsp;

�You said you wanted to talk about the
National Geographic article.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, yes. Look, you were right with your
advice, like I said. The fuss died away pretty quickly. There was some
sensational coverage in the press but like you said, they�ve got bored and
moved on. The odd thing is that some other people haven�t. Here.� He turned to
his desk and pulled a wad of papers from it. �These are copies of some of
them,� he said. �The originals have gone back to the Foreign Office in Kolin. There are more. All pretty much the same.�

&nbsp;

I looked at the papers. Letters, perhaps
twenty or thirty, all of them from women all saying
pretty much the same thing. Kushtia sounded like an ideal society, one in which
women were valued as women. Was there any opportunity for a woman to come and
live in Kushtia as a Kushtian woman? How could a woman become a Kushtian bride?
Was it possible to work in Kushtia?� 

&nbsp;

I looked at the addresses; UK, France, Germany, USA;� all were represented.

&nbsp;

�It looks like you�ll be able to have your
pick,� I said. �You won�t be needing us to pick up
slaves if they are volunteering.�

&nbsp;

�Not the same thing, Larry as well you
know. But we are going to work on some of this. We�re thinking about running a
sort of cultural experience programme � you know �learn something of this very
different society�. Just the sort of thing for gap year
students.� Brad gave a leer that would have been worthy of his new son
in law. �I thought you ought to know though, just in case you heard about it
and thought someone else was pooping in your patch.�

&nbsp;

�Thanks Brad,� I said. �I�m sure there�s no
problem from our side. Let us know if you need any help.�

&nbsp;

�I will, Larry, don�t worry,� he said and I
left him.� 

&nbsp;

I was chatting to Clegg later on. I told
him about the �cultural experience programme�. He looked a bit disbelieving at
first and then seemed to think about it. He didn�t say anything that gave away
his views on it.� �Plus I over heard Brad
say something that might interest you,� I said. �He seemed to think there might
be some problems with keeping his operation here in the UK
going.� 

&nbsp;

Clegg gave a quiet smile. �I wondered how
long it would take for it to get back to him,� he said. I�ve been having some
words with the Kalinin. Brad�s great fun and he�s a good customer but, well, discreet
isn�t a word that he uses much. I�ve been worried that he might start
attracting attention.�

&nbsp;

�How come now?�

&nbsp;

�Well, normally it wouldn�t be a problem;
there�d be a few folk for the Kushtian�s to pay off
and no one would be bothered. It�s just that some of Elly�s
contacts suggest that the police and security services are getting a bit more
concerned lately about the trafficking of women for sex. Planning some sort of
crack down.�

&nbsp;

�That�ll be more of a problem for us than
Brad, won�t it�

&nbsp;

Freddie shook his head. �No, it�s not our
side of it that they are interested in. They don�t believe there�s any sort of
export traffic, they think it�s all the other way. They�re much more concerned
about imports.�

&nbsp;

�The Treasury worried about the balance of
trade deficit again?� I joked.

&nbsp;

Freddie smiled. �No, no. It�s much more the
fact that Johnny Foreigner might be disrupting the status quo in the sex
industry. Might even be exposing the lower classes to it and that would never
do! Tsk, tsk!� He was
grinning. I�d come to understand that Freddie didn�t much care for the way the
British establishment kept its pleasures to itself. �So they�re out looking for
foreign interests that might be part of a sex slave trafficking network.�

&nbsp;

�And the castle would fall into that
category?�

&nbsp;

�Mmm,� said
Freddie. �I think it might. Too conspicuous. And in the wrong place. Out in the countryside like that,
attracts too much attention. If you want to run something like that you need to
put it where no one will notice. Somewhere busy, somewhere
crowded.�

&nbsp;

�Like the Prep Centre?�

&nbsp;

�Exactly. Anyway the Kalinin was pretty understanding. He�s not seen
much in the way of results from Brad�s operation so he�s going to get the Trade
Minister to recall him.�

&nbsp;

I finally managed to talk to Freddie about
my idea for a �voluntary slave� operation. I�d been thinking about it for a
while. The experiences with Kelly had given me the idea in the first place and
the Kushtian experience following the article in National Geographic seemed to
indicate that there might be something in it.���


&nbsp;

Freddie looked as though he was taking it
on board but it�s always hard to tell with him. He said he�d think about it. I
reckoned that meant I hadn�t made a good enough case.

Chapter
66 : Room Service

&nbsp;

�The London Garrick, Drury Lane,�
Kelly�s text had said. 

&nbsp;

I�d spent half an hour wandering around the
public areas and worked out a plan for a bit of fun. It wasn�t a big place, there was the usual lobby, stairs up, lifts, a couple
of phone booths. Off to the right, a small bar. I sat in a coffee shop across
the road and watched her arrive, trundling her case in through the front door.
I gave her time to check in.

&nbsp;

�Meet you for a drink?� I
texted. �7:30 in the bar?�

&nbsp;

�Fine,� she came back. �CU. Sounds tame
though!!� 

&nbsp;

I looked at my watch. It was only five. I
had plenty of time to pick up some things. I flagged down a cab. �Brewer Street,�
I said. I knew a few places in Soho where I might get what I wanted.

&nbsp;

I got back to the hotel just after half past seven. Kelly was sure to be in the bar. The lobby was pretty quiet. I
walked around to an alcove just behind the phone booths and sat down with the
small back pack with my toys on my lap. I phoned the hotel on my mobile. �I�d
like to talk to Miss Kelly Rollins I�m supposed to be meeting her in the bar.�

&nbsp;

�If you�ll hold on, I�ll find her for you,�
the receptionist said helpfully.

&nbsp;

A few moments later I heard a voice saying,
�The courtesy phones are over their Miss Rollins, I�ll put the call through on
the far one.� Very convenient, I thought. I heard Kelly�s voice as she picked
up the courtesy phone. �Hello?� she said. �Who�s there?�

&nbsp;

�Go to the lift,� I said quietly but
insistently. �Don�t look around.�� I
heard her gulp as she put down the phone.�


&nbsp;

As she walked up to the lift I put my bag
over my shoulder and stepped up close behind her. I had a knife hidden in the
palm of my hand. I let her feel it prick against her back. She gave a whimper.
�Let�s go upstairs,� I said, quietly. I let her call the lift, standing close
behind her all the time. The doors slid open three
people got out and brushed past us, I let her feel the knife again, put my
other hand on her back and guided her forward into the empty lift. She pushed
the button for her floor. We rode up, her facing the doors, me close behind
her. The lift didn�t stop until we reached the fifth. Kelly led the way, still
at knife point along the corridor. We passed a service cart and a couple of
housemaids. I gave her a prick as we went by to remind her to behave.

&nbsp;

We reached her room. She took out her key
card and slipped it into the slot. As the green light came on, I grabbed the
door handle, wrenched it open and pushed her through. She tripped on the door
sill as she went in and fell down, sprawling across the floor of the room.

&nbsp;

�Stay down there,� I hissed, �and get on
your face. Put your hands behind your head. I grabbed the �do not disturb� sign
from the door handle, hung it on the outside and pushed the door shut. I tipped
out my bag of toys onto the floor beside Kelly and started by pulling the ski
mask over my face. Of course she knew it was me but it seemed more fun like
that. Then came the gag, a thick rubber plug that I
pushed between her lips and past her teeth into her mouth. The plug was held on
a broad leather strap that covered almost the whole of the lower half of her
face. She grunted as I fastened the buckle to hold it in place, pushing the
plug deep into her mouth. I pulled her wrists down behind her, not being too gentle.
A pair of leather cuffs linked by a short chain served to keep them locked
together behind her back.

&nbsp;

I rolled her over. I could see her eyes
were already bright with arousal. She was breathing heavily, through her nose, hmmphing softly behind the gag.

&nbsp;

I took some time to look her over. I guess
she�d come straight from what ever she�d been doing - she looked like she was
dressed for work. She was wearing a fairly plain grey dress with a pattern of
small flowers on it. Some sort of silky material. I�m
no expert. Dark grey tights. Grey suede shoes. Low
heels, nothing flash. She was obviously enjoying me looking her over from
behind the mask, she grunted and wriggled trying her
wrists against the cuffs. I put out a hand to cup one of her breasts. She tried
to pull away, not keen to let her assailant take advantage of her.

&nbsp;

I took that as a cue. There was a seam
running down the front of the dress. I grabbed either side of her v-neckline
and tugged. The stitches parted easily enough. She was squealing in distress
now. I guess I should have checked to see if she had another dress with her but
it was too late. It ripped clean through to the hem. I pushed aside the two
torn halves. She might have been mad but her nipples were perking up nicely
beneath the silk of her grey bra.

&nbsp;

That was my next target. I took the knife
and sliced through the material between the two cups, exposing her breasts. I�d
bought a couple of nipple clamps and took this opportunity to clip them in
place. She whimpered as I tightened them.

&nbsp;

I looked down at her knickers,
a damp stain was spreading from her crotch. I pulled down her tights, smiling
at the way her soaking cunt signalled her excitement.
I reached into my bag and pulled out the small vibrator I�d acquired. I pushed
it in, turned it on and pulled her pants and tights back up. She was wriggling
more than ever now. I ripped a strip of material from her dress, gripped her
ankles in one hand and tied them together. Now she was wriggling more than ever
before; grunting with pleasure and frustration into her gag.

&nbsp;

�I fancy a drink,� I said. She gave a
squeal. I picked up the room�s key card and headed to the door. I pulled off my
mask before I went outside. I figured it wasn�t too smart to appear in the
corridor like that.����������� �

&nbsp;

I didn�t take too long but I always think
it�s a shame to hurry a beer � especially at London hotel
prices. When I got back Kelly was pretty distracted. She whimpered as I
stripped off everything except the ski mask. She yelped as I took off her
nipple clamps, groaned as I pulled the vibrator from her and bucked her body as
I took my cock and fucked her.

&nbsp;

As the two of us came, I was pleased that
she had the gag on. There�s such a thing as not disturbing the other guests, I
feel.

&nbsp;

Afterwards we lay together, still coupled
but motionless; sweating but silent. She shook her head and grunted. I took it
that she�d like the gag taken off and obliged.

&nbsp;

�Bastard, bastard, bastard,� she smiled.
�Where did you get that stuff? Or were you doing more at the Fetish Fair than
you owned up to?�

&nbsp;

�Kelly, we�re less than a mile from the
kinkiest shops in London.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, yes. I was forgetting. In which case you were very restrained.�

&nbsp;

�I thought you were the one that was
restrained,� I said with a smirk.

&nbsp;

�Whips and chains are fine but lay off the
jokes!� she said laughing. �Now are you going to take these cuffs off me and
buy me a drink?�

&nbsp;

�Sure, if you�ve got something else to
wear.� She nodded. I freed her and we each of us showered. She pulled on a
sweater and pair of slacks, not bothering with underwear.

&nbsp;

�You�re going to have to take me shopping,�
she said, �you�re wrecking my wardrobe.�

&nbsp;

�No problem,� I said, �I saw some very
fetching fashions in Brewer
  Street.�

&nbsp;

�I was thinking something other than PVC,
rubber or leather,� she said. �Now come on, are we going to have that drink?�

&nbsp;

We headed on down to the bar. It was quiet.
We were the only people there apart from a barman who seemed more interested in
the football match going showing on the TV screen that hung down in one corner
of the room. We got our drinks and made ourselves comfortable in one corner.
Kelly curled up on the couch, tucking her legs underneath her. She had a
relaxed air about her, smiling, her hair loose, her
V-necked sweater clinging precariously to one shoulder. I just about managed to
keep my hands off her.

&nbsp;

�This is a lot of fun, Larry,� she said. I
sensed there was a �but� coming. �But.�� 

&nbsp;

We had a long chat. It was clear that while
she enjoyed what we got up to, she didn�t like the way it was working; - the
two of us just fetching up occasionally as and when one or the other felt like
some pervy sex. She thought she was looking for
something more permanent; just as much oriented to the world of BDSM, but just
more permanent.

&nbsp;

I could see ways in which I could make it
very permanent indeed for her, but I didn�t think that would be fair. Besides
with Sukie and Rachel to worry about I couldn�t see
how I could make a bigger commitment to Kelly, right now.

&nbsp;

The evening ended up with one of those
tense, quiet, times. Each of us was staring into our drink. She had shredded a
paper napkin into tiny strips in the ashtray.

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry, Kelly,� I started, �It�s not��

&nbsp;

�If you dare say, �its not you it�s me�
then I swear I will take you upstairs and use those cuffs and ball gag on you.�
She managed a grin and I smiled back.

&nbsp;

�You�re right,� I said. �Look, I can�t step
up to what you need right now. Maybe in the future.
Who knows? I enjoy what we do.� A lot. But I�m not ready to go any further right now. I�m
sorry if you think I�ve been unfair.�

&nbsp;

She shook her head. �No,
Larry, no. I guess I�ve just had a few too many dishonest relationships
and the stuff we get up to; well, I�d just like to be doing that every night.
Still, one of the girls from the Munch wrote off to the Kushtian Embassy �
wants to go out there as a concubine, can you believe? I couldn�t do that. So I
can hardly complain, can I?�

&nbsp;

I shrugged. I was puzzled by the reference
to the Kushtian�s but then I remembered the letters
that Brad had shown me. We were both looking glum.

&nbsp;

She drained the last of her drink. �Oh,
come on,� she said. �I�m not leaving things like this.�

&nbsp;

�I guess the convention is that I say, �we can still be friends, right?� isn�t it?�

&nbsp;

�Yepp. And I say, �of course, we�re both grown up� don�t I?� There was a
sparkle in her eyes.

&nbsp;

�We can still be friends, right?� I said.

&nbsp;

She looked at me for a moment. �No,� she
said. I looked puzzled for a moment. �But you can still come around and fuck me
at gun point though.� She laughed.

&nbsp;

�I�ve only got the knife, at the moment,� I
said smiling.

&nbsp;

�That�ll do,� she said, getting to her
feet. We both laughed and headed for the lift. If it was going to be the last
time at least we would make the best of it.���

Chapter
67 : Programme Development

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

When I got back to the Centre, Sukie was busy getting the evening meal ready. She said
Rachel was down in the programme training room so I thought I�d go and see how
she was getting on.

&nbsp;

As I arrived, she was just finishing her
session. Naked, she was sitting up on one of the two leather covered couches
with a broad grin on her face. 

&nbsp;

Rachel waved as she saw me through the
window of the treatment room and went back to disconnecting herself from the
wires that both delivered the stimuli and monitored her response.

&nbsp;

She hopped down from the couch a I went through the door. She ran across to me and threw
her arms around me. �Mmm,� she said. �You came back.
Can we play now?�

&nbsp;

�Rachel, you just finished a programme
session,� I said with a grin. �You should have had enough pleasure for now!�

&nbsp;

�Enough?� she said with a smile on her
face. �I�m not sure I know that word. What else can I do, then?�

&nbsp;

I had a few projects in mind for her. We
chatted about them for a while - she sat on the couch sucking provocatively on
a pale lemon dildo; me standing by, still in my office suit. By the end of our
talk she had at least been distracted from the dildo by the idea of pleasing me
by getting some writing done. Mind you it had been a close run thing. It had
been hard to keep my mind on what I wanted to get done watching her as she slid
the yellow plastic dildo backwards and forwards between her lips as I talked
through what I wanted. In the end we both laughed. She pulled on one of the
loose smocks that she wore most of the time now, smiled and headed off in
search of her lap top.

&nbsp;

The Doc appeared just as Rachel was
leaving. Rachel smiled at her and disappeared. �She seems OK,� I said to the
Doc.

&nbsp;

She nodded, cautiously. �Yes, she seems to
have recovered. As long as she avoids the substances that trigger the attacks
she should be all right. And she�s got back into the programme. Her responses
are every bit as good as they were before the attack, about the same as the
others too.�

&nbsp;

�Is that what you�d expect? I mean isn�t there
a difference a willing participant and one that is � well � forced?�

&nbsp;

�She�s doing fine. There is a difference
although it�s not as much as you might think. Brian�s family were hardly
leaping at the opportunity to take part but they all progressed at about the
same rate as Rachel, the mother and sister especially. The two daughters took
longer to get started but after the initial resistance they soon caught up.
With Rachel she�s been getting on fine allowing for the time out.�

&nbsp;

Harry put his head around the door. �Can I
have a word?� he said. The Doc waved and went out.

&nbsp;

�Sure,� I said. �What is it?�

&nbsp;

�There�s a couple
of things. Firstly, Sarah, I�m a bit worried that she got off lightly over the
whole Cindy thing. I want to make sure she really doesn�t forget that she was
out of order on that.�

&nbsp;

�Of course. She�s finished with the current round of training sessions so it
won�t hurt if you need to have access to her for a few weeks.�

&nbsp;

�Great, thanks,� Harry said.

&nbsp;

�What was the other thing?�

&nbsp;

Harry looked a bit bashful. �Umm, you�re
going to think this is a bit odd,� he said. �Do you and Kelly want to go out on
a date?�

&nbsp;

�A date?�

&nbsp;

�Yeah. You remember that barmaid I�d picked up with?� I nodded. �Well she
sort of says, �how come I never get to meet any of your friends, and�.��� You know how it is.�

&nbsp;

�Wouldn�t it be better if I brought one of
the girls from here? Tricia maybe,� then I remembered our last evening together, it hadn�t been a great pleasure for either of us,
�Or Eva?�

&nbsp;

�Maybe. I �d just thought Kelly sounded pretty normal from what you�d said
and maybe it would work?�

&nbsp;

�Well, I could have a word with her but its not really a �going on dates� sort of relationship.�
Harry looked puzzled. �Its more a �going in the bedroom and
shagging ourselves stupid� sort of relationship.�

&nbsp;

�Oh,� said Harry.� I guess I was a bit unfair. There wasn�t much
else he could say.

&nbsp;

�Look, I really don�t think it would be a
good idea with Kelly. Let�s try and set something up with Tricia .She�s looking
for a way to get into your good books, isn�t she?� Harry nodded. �She�s been
nagging me about trying to get a lead on an operation, is I can�t imagine she
hasn�t been trying to butter you up as well.� 

&nbsp;

Harry nodded. �Yeah.
Still she�s going to get her chance so maybe she�ll back off a bit. We could
try that if you think it would work.�

&nbsp;

�Sure Harry,� I
said. �Tricia will be fine about it.� Leastways, I hoped she would. �And I�ll
send Sarah up to see you about the other stuff.�

&nbsp;

�Thanks,� said Harry, �and don�t be too
gentle with her. I want to make an impression.�

&nbsp;

I went and found Sara. She was sitting in
one of the training rooms going through some of the material for the next
training programme. She looked up as I came in. �Hi, Larry,� she said brightly.
�Anything I can do?�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� I said coldly. �You can remember
your position here. And you can get stripped off.�

&nbsp;

�What?� she asked, puzzled by my manner.

&nbsp;

�You heard,� I said. Evidently dismayed,
she started to strip off her blouse and skirt. I turned towards her. �Quicker than
that, #06.085,� I snapped using Sarah�s slave number.

&nbsp;

Sarah looked startled. �Sorry, Sir,� she
said, quickly finishing her task.

&nbsp;

�Right,� I said. �Over by
the wall. Hands on your head. Quick!� Sarah,
surprised by my brusqueness, complied. I picked up the phone, to call a guard.
�Can you come and take this one down to the cells, please. And you�d better
bring restraints.�

&nbsp;

When they arrived, they were pretty rough
with her. Not realising quite what was happening, Sarah struggled at first as
they grabbed her arms, wrestling her to her knees. 

&nbsp;

�Please, you don�t need to do this!� she
was shaking her head as they dragged her arms down. She was forced into a heavy
canvas straight jacket, her arms crossed across her body and then strapped down
so that she couldn�t move. A strap passed down between her legs and up between
her buttocks to fasten to the back of the jacket. Sarah squealed as they jerked
the strap tight. One of the guards held a plug gag out towards me. I nodded.

&nbsp;

�No!� yelped Sara. �Noooo ooughhgghm.� The
guard pushed the plug gag home, filling her mouth and fixing it in place with
straps behind her head. Sarah was shaking her head in confusion.

&nbsp;

�Put her on a short chain in one of the
cells,� I said. I knew what that would mean � she wouldn�t be able to move for
more than a foot. �She�ll stay that way until her case is reviewed.� Sarah,
puzzled by her change of fortunes, was led away by the guards.� 

&nbsp;

I was set to spend a very agreeable evening
with Sukie and Rachel. Normally Sukie
did most of the domestic stuff around the flat but after dinner, Rachel
insisted that she was going to clear things away and told Sukie
and me to go and relax.

&nbsp;

By the time she came back, Sukie and I were sprawled on the couch, Sam Cooke on the
stereo. Rachell was carrying a tray, she knelt down
beside us. �I�m the help, tonight,� she said, passing a wine glass to Sukie and then to me. She opened the bottle and poured us
each a glass. She sat back on her heels, smiling, as together we toasted her in
thanks. 

&nbsp;

Our amusements were interrupted by a
telephone call. It was Steve Glennis. �Larry,� he
called. �Hope I�m not disturbing you.�

&nbsp;

I grunted. �No problem, Steve,� I said.

&nbsp;

He took the hint. �I�ll keep it short,� he
said. �I just wanted to say that this Lady M is one nice piece. You know what
it�s like here on the Island. She�s taken over running the household for me, got the other
slaves running around like she�s the lady of the manor.� 

&nbsp;

�I guess she is,� I responded. �How�s the
carriage driving?�

&nbsp;

�First class. I�d have her over to Meadowlands for the Hambletonian
if I could.�

&nbsp;

�I�m sure she�d pass muster but there might
be some comment about what was between the shafts,� I said, thinking back to
the pony girls that Steve kept in his stables.

&nbsp;

Even over the phone I could hear Steve�s
wry chuckle. �Yes but she�s having a good effect on the stock. You should have
seen her down in the training ring this morning putting one of them through her
paces on the lunge rein.�

&nbsp;

From what I�d seen of Lady M, the thought
of her in tight jodhpurs and riding boots was an agreeable one. �I�d have liked
to have seen that,� I said.

&nbsp;

�Yeah. Well, you need to come over some time, see how the markets are
developing over here, that sort of thing.�

&nbsp;

�Uhhuh,� I said,
intrigued by where this might lead. �Let me think about when I could get over,
Steve,� I said.����� �

&nbsp;

�OK,� said Steve. �Don�t leave it too long
though.�

&nbsp;

Chapter
68 : Russian Roulette

&nbsp;

Steve�s idea sounded attractive. I could
see that I could free up some time in a couple of weeks or so but I wasn�t sure
whether I could justify the trip. I thought I�d talk to Freddie about it first.

�

If I had thought that Tricia getting her
chance as a lead collector would improve her humour I was mistaken. She�d been
as pleased as anything when she told me that Harry had said she could finally
run lead on a collection. She�d been nagging him (and me) for what seemed like
months. But now she seemed less than happy with the challenge.

&nbsp;

�Look, just let me get on with it, will
you?� Tricia wasn�t in the best of moods. I�d made the mistake of offering some
unsolicited advice and I was getting my ears bent for my trouble. I knew she
wanted to make a good showing but I�d thought it might help if we discussed it.
Wrong, evidently.

&nbsp;

�OK, OK,� I said. �I didn�t mean to
interfere, I just�.�

&nbsp;

�Well, just don�t she growled and headed
off to the other end of the office.

&nbsp;

She was still simmering when I stopped by
her desk later that afternoon. �Larry,� she said, �I�m doing this myself. I
don�t need your help and I don�t want to talk about it. You stick to your
account management and marketing and I�ll stick to what I�m good at. I don�t
tell you how to run the clients so don�t tell me how to plan a pick up.�

&nbsp;

�Sure,� I said, �Look I don�t want to argue
about this. Why don�t we grab a drink later?�

&nbsp;

She shook her head. �Nuh-uh,�
she grunted turning back to her pile of research reports, �I�m going to be
busy. I just don�t want to be distracted right now.�

&nbsp;

Cindy came teetering over on heels high so
sharp you wanted to keep your feet out of the way of hers and put another pile
of reports down on Tricia�s desk. �See what I have to go through,� Tricia
growled, to no one in particular, �and he wants to go for a drink.� 

&nbsp;

I left her to it feeling more than a bit
aggrieved. As I went out I passed Sarah. Harry had decided that she needed a
few weeks on menial tasks just to remind her of her real status. They�d put her
in an ill fitting overall, shackles on her ankles and wrists, plug gag in her
mouth. Dressed like that she was available for any dismal task hat was needed
around the office. As I left she was on her knees with a scrubbing brush,
cleaning up some spilled coffee under one of the desks. She sat back on her
heels as I went by but suddenly realised she was supposed not to look up and
cast her eyes down again. She set back to her scrubbing. Harry�s approach was
obviously having an impact.

&nbsp;

I didn�t see Tricia for a couple of days
but I did bump into Eva in the canteen. �How did Tricia�s pick up going?� I
asked her.

&nbsp;

�OK, I guess for a first time. The target�s
coming into reception just about now, do you want to see?� 

&nbsp;

Well, Tricia hadn�t asked me but I was
interested so I thought I�d go look.

&nbsp;

Tricia turned up driving a regular Clegg
Meat Products truck. She had one of the other girls up front with her. The two
of them were grinning as they climbed down from the truck�s cab. �Job done,�
Tricia called out, more for Eva�s benefit than for mine, I felt. �One very
talented mathematician to help out Sebastian�s team, cleanly lifted and stowed
in the back. Brought her lap top along too, so no doubt there�s lots of useful
research stuff on there she�ll be able to carry on working with.�

&nbsp;

Eva opened up the back of the truck.
Tricia�s target was in the back still unconscious. A pale skinned girl with
dark hair, she was maybe twenty two or twenty three years old, I guessed. Black jeans and a pale muddy green top. She didn�t look
anything special, but then I thought neither had Jackie, the girl I�d helped
pick up on my very first mission with Harry. You couldn�t always tell much from
looks, these days it was as likely she�d been snatched because of the college
course she�d completed. �Come on Miss Oblumov,�
Tricia smirked, �let�s get you settled in a nice comfy cell.�

&nbsp;

One of the guards was carrying Tricia�s
target off the truck, Tricia had grabbed her laptop case and was carrying it
aloft like a trophy. Eva, bent down to pick up the
captive�s handbag that had been tossed in beside her. �Didn�t you say this girl
was Ukrainian?� she asked.

&nbsp;

�Sure,� said Tricia, �straight out of Kiev University,
over here studying at Imperial College.�

&nbsp;

�Oh,� said Eva, �I just wondered why she
had a Russian Federation flag on her bag that�s all.� Sure enough, hanging from one of the
straps, was a small replica of the Russian flag with its white, blue and red
stripes. 

&nbsp;

�How should I know?� said Tricia
aggressively, determined to let nothing detract from her triumph. �The Prep
team can work that one out. I�ve done my job.� She grabbed the bag from Eva and
stalked off after her captive.

&nbsp;

Eva had felt there was something odd about
things at that point. I was with Sebastian when he discovered what it was. 

&nbsp;

�Look,� he said. �Pointing
to the screen of the captive�s lap top. Here�s her email account, krysta.oblumov@lse.ac.uk,
plenty of correspondence on her research, plenty of emails back and forth to
friends in the Ukraine � see all the .co.ua addressees? But
here,� he opened up another window, �is another on-line identity alana.kustenky@gorkinet.ru. Lots of family correspondence,
personal stuff, emails to a boyfriend in Volgograd, no work
stuff at all. Our little collection isn�t all she seems.�

&nbsp;

�Tell me I didn�t hear the name Kustenky just then.� It was Freddie�s voice. He was
standing in the doorway. 

&nbsp;

Seb looked up. �Err, �fraid so, boss,� he
said.

&nbsp;

�Oh great.� I didn�t think he was being enthusiastic. �I want a summary of
everything you�ve got on this pick up on my desk in thirty minutes and I want
to see whoever responsible for this collection in my office at the same time.�
He stormed off. Tricia looked puzzled.

&nbsp;

She was looking abashed when I saw her an
hour later.

&nbsp;

�What�s the problem?� I asked.

&nbsp;

�Nothing I can�t fix,� she said scowling
and stalked off.

&nbsp;

She might have thought she could fix it but
obviously Freddie didn�t. He called me in an hour later. �You�re the man for
PR,� he said. �How do we sort this out?�

&nbsp;

�I don�t know,� I said, �I don�t really
understand the problem except this girl isn�t who we thought she was when we
picked her up.�

&nbsp;

�The problem isn�t who she isn�t, the problem is who she is. Or
rather who her daddy is.�

&nbsp;

�And daddy is?�

&nbsp;

�Kustenky,� he
said. I looked blank. �Anatoly Kustenky.�

&nbsp;

�Ah,� I said, recognising the name finally.
�Of football, oil and gas fame.�

&nbsp;

�Football, oil, gas and
one or two businesses not so different from our own in the general area of the
old Russian Empire.�

&nbsp;

�So we have inadvertently picked up his
daughter.�

&nbsp;

�Uh, huh�

&nbsp;

�He�s not going to be pleased.�

&nbsp;

�Almost certainly. And of course he wasn�t terribly happy with us before � Kushtia
being really part of their old sphere of influence in his mind.�

&nbsp;

�Ah.�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� said Freddie. �Ah, it most certainly
is.�

&nbsp;

�Well my PR advice would be to seize the
initiative, contact him directly and explain what happened. I�d get Alana out
of her cell and into more comfortable accommodation and suggest that you and he
get together so he can be reunited with her as soon as possible.�

&nbsp;

�Well, it�s a start. I�m not sure he�ll
respond to just an �I�m terribly sorry, old man,� but I guess we can try. Mind
you apologising isn�t really my style.�

&nbsp;

�No,� I said. �That�s why he just might
believe you.� Clegg just grunted and looked thoughtful.� 

&nbsp;

I saw Tricia shortly afterwards. �You just
had to stick your nose in didn�t you? You couldn�t just leave it to me to sort
out?�

&nbsp;

�Hang on,� I said. �Clegg called me in.
What am I supposed to so? Tell him to get lost because you�re being precious
about your first mission?�

&nbsp;

�Precious! I am not being precious. This
wasn�t my fault.�

&nbsp;

�Nobody said it was, Trish. But if Freddie
asks me to help then I have to help, don�t I?�

&nbsp;

�Why can�t he trust me to sort it out?�

&nbsp;

�Because it looks like you cocked it up.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, great! So now you�re blaming me, too.�

&nbsp;

�Trish, that�s not what I said.�

&nbsp;

�Oh! Oh, just fuck off. Go and shag your
little island girl. Or take a turn with the writer. Just stay away from me.�
She grabbed her things and ran off. I didn�t feel inclined to follow her.

&nbsp;

She didn�t look any the more pleased to see
me when we turned up in Clegg�s office two days later to meet with Mr. Kustenky. His daughter was sitting in one of Clegg�s
comfortable armchairs. They�d found her some clean clothes and she�d had a
comfortable room in the area we usually used for entertaining customers. Clegg
was sitting behind his desk, looking pensive as he asked the two of us to sit
down. Elly was there too, looking as inscrutable as
ever. Alana dealt Tricia a poisonous glance. Tricia at least had the grace to
look embarrassed. She was wearing a dark blue trouser suit over a white top.
I�d suggested to Clegg that something sober and professional would be best. She
wasn�t talking to me.� Moments later Kustenky was shown in.

&nbsp;

�Anatoly,� Clegg beamed getting to his feet
and proffering a hand.

&nbsp;

The massive Russian looked at it and ignored
it. �Clegg, Ms Grant,� he acknowledged. He took no notice of Tricia and myself
but turned to his daughter. �Are you all right?� he asked.

&nbsp;

�Da,� she
replied. Kustenky grunted and took a seat at Clegg�s
suggestion.

&nbsp;

�Mr Kustenky, I
just wish to extend my most heartfelt apologies for the mix up over your
daughter.� Kustenky looked unimpressed. I could see
that Elly was watching him closely, �It was entirely
our fault and we should of course have realised through our research that what
we thought was a legitimate target was, in fact, off-limits. I can only seek to
assure you that it was completely inadvertent. The person responsible is here,�
he gestured towards Tricia, �and wishes to add her own apologies.�

&nbsp;

I could imagine the conversation that had
gone on between Tricia and Clegg but in fairness to her she managed to make it
sound sincere. �Mr Kustenky,� she said, �this was
completely my fault. I missed details in our original evaluation that would
have led us to realise the identity of your daughter. I can only add my
apologies to those of Mr Clegg. We have done everything to ensure your
daughter�s comfort once we realised the situation, as I am sure she will
confirm.�

&nbsp;

Alana gave a short nod of agreement. Kustenky turned to Clegg. �Well,� he said. �That seems
fair. I accept your apologies. No hard feelings as you British say.� Clegg
smiled. Tricia looked relieved. Elly was still
watching with an impassive stare. �There is however, the issue of
compensation,� Kustenky went on. 

&nbsp;

�Compensation?� queried Clegg. Elly began to look concerned.

&nbsp;

�Yes,� said Kustenky.
�The disruption to my daughter�s education. The emotional stress. My own time in
having to come here. Most inconvenient.�

&nbsp;

�I see,� said Clegg, warily. �I can
understand your point of view. What do you propose?�

&nbsp;

�Well, Mr Clegg.� Kustenky
leant forward across the desk and brought his hands together. �Your
organisation is respected, well respected. You are known not to employ
incompetents. You should not allow thet thought that
might be the case to prosper. I suggest that I take this young lady here,� he
pointed to Tricia, �as compensation. You will be seen to have acted decisively.
The person responsible will be seen to have paid appropriately. I will have an
asset that I can realise. I am prepared to take the risk on the financial
implications.�

&nbsp;

�That�s ridiculous,� said Tricia getting to
her feet, looking towards Clegg for support and then becoming increasingly
concerned as she saw it was not there. Elly simply
shook her head at Tricia.

&nbsp;

�Oh, I don�t think so,� said Clegg, pulling
a pistol from his desk drawer and pointing it straight at her. �It seems like a
most reasonable arrangement to me. I know I�ve invested heavily in your
training Tricia, dear, but sometimes you have to know not to let bad money
follow good.� He turned towards me. �Be a good chap
and put something around the girl�s wrists will you, Larry old boy,� he said.

&nbsp;

�No, Larry,� Tricia begged, �you can�t.�

&nbsp;

I was in a quandary. We�d had a good thing
going for a while but after all it had been Trish that had been the one to back
away. And I didn�t want to argue with Clegg or Kustenky.
�Sorry Trish,� I said, reaching for the pair of handcuffs that sat on Clegg�s
desk and snapped them around Tricia�s wrists. Elly
seemed to relax. 

&nbsp;

Alana looked approving. �She grabbed me. That one. She used the drugs,� she said, gesturing at Tricia
as she struggled against the cuffs. �Now she�ll see how it feels. Here,� she
pulled a scarf from her handbag and tossed it to me. �For a
gag. We won�t want to listen to her complaints on our way back.� I put a
knot in the middle of the scarf and ignoring Tricia�s pleading looks jammed it
into her mouth. She gasped and groaned, I suspected with both pain and
betrayal, as I jerked the scarf tight to knot it behind her head. Alana got up
and gripped Tricia by the arm. 

&nbsp;

Kustenky got to his feet. This time he extended his hand. �Freddie,� he
said.

&nbsp;

Clegg responded grasping the Russian�s hand
in both of his. �Anatoly,� he replied.

&nbsp;

�I�m pleased we settled this amicably,� Kustenky said. �Maybe we should talk more.� 

&nbsp;

�Of course,� said Clegg. �I�ll see this
young lady is shipped on.� Alana looked disappointed that she wouldn�t be
taking Tricia with her. �You�ll understand that we�ll want to hep her to lose
any memories that she may have of her work here. There may be some other damage
but nothing that will prevent you from using her as a sexual toy or a domestic.
In fact the programme we have here will make her very suitable for the former
if that�s something you can find a use for.� Tricia�s struggles became all the
more acute.

&nbsp;

�I understand, Clegg. You must protect your
organisation and if this asset has proved unreliable she can only be used for
menial tasks anyway. Honour is satisfied in any respect. We also need to talk,
about other matters, I think. You are busy with some old friends of ours.� 

&nbsp;

�The Kushtians?� said Clegg. �They
approached us, you know.�

&nbsp;

�I�m sure. I�m sure. Our old colonies are
perhaps more willing to look for new friends than to remember their old ones.
I�m sure you have the same problems.�

&nbsp;

�Anatoly, you are right. There are places,
once pink on the map, that seem to have forgotten
those that might be best able to help them.�

&nbsp;

�I thought so. There are some parts of Africa where we might be able to
take a role not open to you any more. Some cooperative ventures might be
possible. You would acquire in Europe or UK we would sell in some of the central and southern African states.
Would that make sense?�

&nbsp;

Clegg looked towards Elly,
evidently taking her deadpan look for support. �It could, Anatoly, it could.
We�re more in the client specific markets these days anyway. Not so much in
general sales, we�d be happy to talk about different ways of doing things..�

&nbsp;

�Good. I�ll arrange a conversation between us
and Constanza. She�s keen to be part of this too.�

&nbsp;

�OK,� said Freddie, carefully. �Can you
give us any tips on dealing with the Kushtians?�

&nbsp;

Anatoly laughed as he got to his feet.
�Sell to them if you want but don�t trust them and never try to work with them.
Too greedy, too careless. They�ve lived in the past
for too long. Maybe they�ll change or maybe the past will come around again but
for those of us that must live in the present they don�t make good bedfellows.�
Elly�s face betrayed a flicker of an �I told you so�
expression. �Oh and stay away from their women,� he said, �sell them all that
you like but never take one for your own. Trust me, I know from experience.�
Alana gave him a poisonous look. For some reason, it made me suspect that her
mother might have been Kushtian.

�� 

At that, Anatoly left taking his daughter
with him. Clegg called for one of the guards. He looked surprised to see Tricia
struggling and grunting but he didn�t hesitate when Clegg told him to take her
down to the cells. She whimpered as she was hustled away.

&nbsp;

Clegg followed them out, leaving Elly and me behind. Elly sat down
behind Clegg�s desk. As she did so she pulled a small
automatic pistol from behind her where it had been tucked into the waistband of
her trousers. She checked it, flicked the safety catch on, and put it
down on the desk. �You made a good call,� she said, smiling at me.

&nbsp;

�Call?� I said.

&nbsp;

�Over Tricia. I wasn�t sure if you would. I thought there might be some
sentimental attachment that might make things difficult.� I didn�t say
anything. �I wonder if it would have been different if it had been Sukie or Rachel.�

&nbsp;

�Perhaps,� I said slowly. �But, then, I
feel responsible for them. They are here because of me. Tricia wasn�t. She
chose this game.�

&nbsp;

�And what do you think about this game? You
chose it too, didn�t you?�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� I acknowledged. �But it�s different
to how I thought it would turn out I guess.�

&nbsp;

�You�re not the only one,� Elly said. �but I need to talk to
Freddie about that.�

&nbsp;

Chapter 69 : Conference Call

&nbsp;

Tricia�s downfall caused some consternation
in the organisation for a while. Nobody likes to see a colleague suddenly taken
out like that. On the other hand most people seemed to have had a belly full of
having their ears bent by Tricia�s constant, �Why won�t they let me lead a
collection?� so the general view was that she had it coming to her.

&nbsp;

Harry and Rick were pretty nervous in case
Freddie came gunning for them too. After all it had
been Harry�s call, in the end to give Tricia the lead on that job and Rick�s
team had done the intelligence gathering. In the end I guess, Freddie decided
that it was better to have them in place worrying about things than to try to
change things around.

&nbsp;

I saw Tricia after they�d been working on
her for only a few days. She was being put through her paces down in one of the
training rooms. The combination of the drugs and the mistreatment she was going
through had taken its toll already. Anatoly had said he intended to use her as
a housemaid at their summer dacha. Freddie had thought she should be delivered
in a state where she was fully equipped to perform her required role as well as
having no recollection of her work for his business. She�d been put into a
maid�s uniform, black dress, white apron and cap. Her trainer was sitting in an
armchair while Tricia served him a drink. I looked in on them. Tricia didn�t
respond to my arrival. Her blank look and the dribble of drool from the corner
of her slack mouth provided all the evidence that was needed of the
ruthlessness of the way in which she was being prepared for Kustenky.
Freddie had warned that there might be some damage. As far as I could see, it
was more a question of whether she�d even be able to function in the limited
way that we�d promised. From the way she looked it was surprising that she
could manage to walk and hold a tray. I found it pretty distressing to see her
like that, but I still didn�t think that there was much I could have done about
it, once Freddie (and, presumably, Elly) had decided
to cut their losses over her. I was just glad that it hadn�t involved Sukie or Rachel. That would have been a harder call to
make.

&nbsp;

Freddie was busy. He and Elly had been talking together a lot. It was obvious from
what Elly had said that she wasn�t happy with how
things were going with the business. I�d mentioned the conversation that I had
had with Steve and we�d agreed that I�d follow that up if I got a chance. Then
Freddie told me that he and Elly had agreed on moving
things forward with Anatoly. I sat in on a telephone conference with the two of
them, Anatoly and Constanza. 

&nbsp;

Constanza kicked things off. �Things seem to have been a bit difficult for
you lately, Freddie,� she began. �I mean the business with Lady M and now poor
Alana. Not what I�d have thought from your operation.�

&nbsp;

�I think you�ll find,� Clegg said slowly,
�that there have been rather fewer problems with my operation than with yours, Constanza dear. Let�s see, there was that concert pianist
whose fingers you managed to break during the collection process and I seem to
recall that there was a religious sect that was not so happy with the idea of
receiving a new priestess that was only almost a virgin. This is a risky
business, Constanza, we all make mistakes.�

&nbsp;

�Hmm,� cut in Anatoly. �If you two can
avoid the bickering we might get a little further. Let me explain my current
thinking. You two run perfectly adequate collection and preparation
operations.� It sounded as though Anatoly almost heard Clegg�s grin of
satisfaction and I could imagine Constanza�s
querulously raised eyebrow. �At least most of the time, that
is. Constanza, your expertise is in Europe, you don�t understand
the UK. Clegg, you are as proficient in the UK as Constanza is in mainland Europe. I�d like the two of you
to work together. The areas that my organisation covers have a great appetite
for product from western Europe. It�s not practical
for me to source it myself � Clegg you know how conspicuous some of my team
would look in London - but I would like to have some reliable partners, people I can
work with on a continuing basis.�

&nbsp;

�I�m not sure, Anatoly,� Constanza began. �We�re not in a volume business, any more
than Clegg is. You�ve seen the sort of work we do. Most of it is custom
collection to order.�

&nbsp;

�That�s very much the way for us too,
Anatoly,� Clegg agreed. �Almost all of what we are doing is very specific these
days. We�ve turned off the old operations that picked up girls on spec. I don�t
think we�d be very well set up to fill the cages of some Georgian sex camp.�

&nbsp;

I watched Elly
wince. She wasn�t always comfortable with Clegg�s prejudices about foreigners.

&nbsp;

�I think, Freddie,� Anatoly came back in
measured tones, �that you have a rather out of date view of my clients. We are
not talking about high volume but high quality. There�s a lot of money here and
a great interest in acquiring �toys� as my clients call them.�

&nbsp;

�Toys?� said Clegg.

&nbsp;

�Yes, it�s rather a different product from
what you�ve been used to supplying. I sometimes think that the Europeans have
lost all subtlety, your barbarian origins are
reasserting themselves. The approach to slave owning there is often so brutal. Constanza, tell me, do you ever take product back for
resale?�

&nbsp;

�You know we don�t, Anatoly. It�s too often
damaged. We leave the resale market for others. If we�ve picked it and prepped
it we can speak for it. Otherwise, someone else can take the risk.�

&nbsp;

Clegg joined in. �She�s right Anatoly. It�s
a costly business, looking for new collections all the time, but most of the
customers can�t be relied on to keep them in anything like original condition.�

&nbsp;

�Well,� said Anatoly, �I understand that.
But why is it? I�ll tell you. It�s because your customers are brutes. And
Clegg, you must know the Kushtian�s are the worst.�
Clegg grunted. �Now, my client base is rather different. They are looking for
something that they can care for and enjoy. It�s a very good life for those
that are purchased. They lose their freedom, of course, but apart from that
they have a very comfortable life. They have a rather unique relationship with
their new owners and we retain a continuing interest in their well being. The
owners all understand that they must not mistreat their toys � the consequences
for that are unfortunate for the owner. But on the other side the owner is
provided with a sexually delightful companion. We find that requests are often
for more mature women than is the case in other sectors. Forty plus year olds
seem to be highly desired and well suited to the role of toys.�

&nbsp;

�And what does that mean for us?� Clegg
seemed wary. I had my own thoughts. As far as I could tell it meant lower
volumes with less repeat business, higher end user prices but lower margins
because we�d be shipping through Anatoly�s operation and I didn�t imagine he�d
be doing it for the love of it.

&nbsp;

Anatoly spoke slowly. �I suggest it will
mean simply some additional business to your regular activities. You will be
concerned about margins and volumes I am sure.� Elly
leant forward towards the speakerphone, she had obviously picked up on the same
problem that I had. �That is not a point on which you should concern yourself,
the premium on this product line is more than sufficient to cover the expenses
of both my organisation and yours, whichever of you is contributing. I am quite
happy to pursue an open book on accounting for these items. As to volumes,
well, it�s just additional sales, isn�t it? These are opportunities you would
not normally reach. It�s marginal business for you,
additional coverage for your research teams, taking up unused capacity in your
Prep activities and so on.�� 

&nbsp;

Clegg leant forward to the speakerphone.
�Could you excuse us for a minute, Anatoly?� He said.

&nbsp;

�Sure,� said the Russian.

&nbsp;

Clegg clicked the mute switch. �What do we
think?�

&nbsp;

Elly spoke first. �I don�t trust him. Not one inch. But it�s additional business and we could do with it to help
cover overheads. As long as we don�t invest additionally.
And we don�t have to work with Constanza directly.�

&nbsp;

The reference to Constanza
puzzled me. Clegg had seemed quite sanguine about their encounters. Their
exchanges seemed to have an amiable nature. Of course, I then thought, that
might well be what Elly had concerns about. Clegg
turned to me. �Larry?� he said.

&nbsp;

�I think it�s a bit of a distraction and I�d
be surprised if it turns out to be genuinely marginal business. You always end
up needing more resources in my experience. On the other hand, it fits with our
aims to move up-market in terms of product and client if we believe what
Anatoly says about �toys�. Plus I�ve been worried by how much the Kushtian
volumes have been dominating what we�ve been doing. If they went away suddenly
for any reason we�d be in serious cash flow problems, I suspect. I suppose my
view is we should do it but keep our eyes open and carry on trying to develop
other routes to market or product lines.���


&nbsp;

Clegg sat back. �All right,� he said. �I
think we�re agreed. Let�s go back on the line.� He flicked up the mute switch.
The sound of Constanza and Anatoly chuckling after an
exchanged joke came through the speaker. �Sorry for that,� said Clegg.

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry,� said Constanza,
�I was just asking Anatoly how his daughter was.�

&nbsp;

Clegg looked irritated. Elly
put out a hand to his arm as if to say, �Its not worth
it.� Clegg grunted. �I�m sure she�s fine. Isn�t she, Anatoly?�

&nbsp;

�Of course, Freddie, of course,� Anatoly
came back. �Do you think I would be asking you to collect and prep high value
items if she�d come to any harm? In fact, but don�t tell her I told you, I
think you gave her rather an easy ride. Her story of collection and confinement
told me your people had the right methods for this sort of product.�

&nbsp;

Clegg looked rather self satisfied. Elly gave him a �you�re being flattered, be careful� look.

&nbsp;

Anatoly went on. �Well, Constanza
is keen to participate? Can I assume that you are too, Clegg?�

&nbsp;

�Keen is too strong a word, Anatoly,� Clegg
responded. �Willing would be better. Let�s see how it goes. But you can count
us in, at least initially.�

&nbsp;

�You�re too much of a sceptic, Freddie,� Constanza�s voice came in.

&nbsp;

�Maybe,� said Clegg. �I just feel happier
that way.�

&nbsp;

�All right,� said Anatoly. �I will set
things up with my team. I assume you can make available suitable communication
channels to allow us to specify our requirements. My legal team will put
together a distribution collaboration agreement.�

&nbsp;

�You�d better let me see that, Anatoly,�
said Elly.

&nbsp;

�Of course,� said Anatoly.

&nbsp;

�Still spending your time with your head in
contracts?� said Constanza.

&nbsp;

�Still spending yours with your head in
men�s laps?� snapped Elly in an uncharacteristic
momentary loss of control. Clegg coughed and looked sheepish. Elly looked as if she regretted saying it.

&nbsp;

Anatoly cut in. �Well that�s all from my
side,� he said. �I expect we�ll all speak again soon.�

&nbsp;

The line went dead. Freddie turned to me
and said, �I want to understand more about these �toys�. The way Glennis treats his stable is the nearest thing I�ve heard
of to that. Didn�t you say you were going to see him?� I nodded. �Well, I think
you should make it sooner than later.� I left Elly
and Freddie together. It sounded like they had some unfinished business to
discuss.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 70 : Colonial Ambitions

&nbsp;

Rick was still busy refining the
sexualisation and pleasure programme. Harry was using the Tricia debacle as an excuse to get all of his team to re-run some of the basic
operations drills. As he said, after the problems with Lady Marchmont,
and now this, there was room for improvement, to say the least. 

&nbsp;

Life with Sukie
and Rachel carried on much as before. Sukie seemed
content in her role. Rachel had taken on the sexualisation programme with
enthusiasm and her writing was better than ever. 

&nbsp;

I was trying to set up a trip to see Steve Glennis but in the mean time business carried on as usual.
Clegg had been contacted by another of his chums who was looking for a more
personal contact. With Brian now long out of the picture, Clegg had asked me to
follow it up. 

&nbsp;

I was sitting in the Long Room at Lords.
Out on the pitch the England team were 127 for 7 in the first session of the final day needing
another 230 runs to avoid an innings defeat by the Australians and the loss of
the Ashes. With the best will in the world it was looking like a bad day for
English cricket. There was a collective groan from the crowd around the ground
outside and a ripple of polite applause. 127 for 8, I assumed.

&nbsp;

The door at the far end of the room swung
open and an elderly man in wheel chair barged his way through and headed
towards me. �Ross?� he asked as he pulled to a halt alongside me. I nodded.
�Good he said glad you�re on time. Do sit down.�

&nbsp;

He was in his late seventies I guessed
wearing pale flannel trousers and a striped blazer. He wore a tie that had the
air of a demented snake caught in an act of strangulation. It carried the blood
and vomit stripes of the Marylebone Cricket Club.

&nbsp;

I felt I ought to apologise for
interrupting his enjoyment of the game at a crucial moment.

&nbsp;

�Enjoyment?� he snorted. �There�s more fun
to be had sticking your head in a wasps nest. Completely
useless bunch. No backbone. No fibre.� He held his hand out. �Colonel
Snell,� he said, �My friends call me �basher�. You can too.�

&nbsp;

�Unusual nickname,
�basher�. Cricket? Bit
of a batsman were you? Army days? � I said.

&nbsp;

�No,� said Snell. �Before
that. School days. Some of my friends seemed to
think I had an inordinate fondness for the masturbatory arts. Quite right of course. It�s kept me fit for the past sixty
years. Can�t complain can I?� 

&nbsp;

I was regretting asking. I was keen to
change the subject. �Mr Clegg said you had a possible project for us.�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� Basher replied, �Do you never feel a
little cheated? As though your rightful legacy has
been usurped by others?� 

&nbsp;

I shook my head, I
really didn�t have much of an idea what he was on about.

&nbsp;

�You see this?� He pointed to a large world
globe beside the case that held the tiny urn that the collective endeavours of
the two teams on the field were currently directed towards. �In my youth a
large part of this was coloured pink. The British Empire, young man, the British Empire. Just think, we
ruled a quarter of the globe. And what thanks do we have for it now?�

&nbsp;

I tried to look sympathetic. I wasn�t at
all clear what these rants had to do with the job we were being asked to take
on.

&nbsp;

�None!� He barked, prodding at the globe with his stick. �None
at all. And they have the gall to beat us at our own games. Football. Cricket. Golf. All given to the world by the
British. And the weak kneed government does nothing about our national
teams. And to what avail? I ask you? Ha! The occasional success, perhaps, but
it�s the exception. Mark my words!� 

&nbsp;

The club steward was looking concerned at
my guest�s mistreatment of the globe.

&nbsp;

�Never mind Barry, my young fellow, we�ll
show them.�

&nbsp;

�Its Larry,� I said correcting him.

&nbsp;

�Precisely. Barry. I�m no longer a young man, Barry,
want to find some companionship for my old age.�

&nbsp;

�I see, a woman of mature years perhaps,� I
suggested, �someone to bring cheer in your autumn years.�

&nbsp;

�Pah, stuff and
nonsense!� he exploded. �I said I wasn�t young not that I was decrepit. No, I�m
looking for some young girls to amuse me. Take my mind off my aches and pains.
Give me something to do on the long dark winter evenings if you know what I
mean?� he gave me a lascivious leer. �I may be in a wheel chair but just
because my legs don�t work, don�t imagine that everything below the waist is
non-functional. Constant use, that�s what�s kept it working. Constant
use!�

&nbsp;

Well who was I to judge? �I�m sure we have
something suitable in stock,� I said. 

&nbsp;

�Shouldn�t think so,� he said. �I�m a man
of particular tastes.�

&nbsp;

In my experience �particular tastes�
usually turned out to be a euphemism for �raving pervert� but again the more
specialised the tastes, the more opportunity for us to add value and the better
our fee. I said, �And those tastes are?�

&nbsp;

�I wish to rebuild the Empire.� I raised my
eyebrows. �On a small scale to be sure,� he said seeing my astonishment, �but
rebuild it I shall.� He dropped his voice. �A stable of young
ladies from each corner of the Empire. A dozen young women � a dozen
mind not some nasty, continental, decimal ten.�
All of them, under twenty five say. Brought back under the rightful rule of a scion of the United Kingdom.�

&nbsp;

�I see,� I said, �So what Australia,
New Zealand, Canada, India, South
  Africa,��

&nbsp;

�Yes, all of those. Malaya, naturally, Hong Kong, Rhodesia, Kenya, Nigeria. And of course from the biggest colony of all.�

&nbsp;

�Sorry,� I said, puzzled, �I thought we�d
covered the main ones.�

&nbsp;

�You omitted the American Colonies.�

&nbsp;

�What? The USA?�

&nbsp;

�I don�t recognise that term. That fool
George�s fault He lost the lot. Should have held on to it.
Think what the Empire would be like today! But yes we must have at least one
representative of the Thirteen Colonies � New York, Carolina, Massachusetts Bay,
somewhere like that.�

&nbsp;

�Ah,� I said. �You realise, of course that
this will be an expensive project. I mean we�d be talking one and half, two
million, ah.� I caught myself in time, �no, at least a
million pounds sterling.�

&nbsp;

�Not a problem young man,� he replied,
looking relieved that I had avoided the use of the word �dollars�.� 

&nbsp;

�You don�t feel that this could prove
something of a strain? I mean a man of your years. So many
young women?�

&nbsp;

�I may be in a wheel chair, young Barry but
I�m not in my grave just yet. I�m more than able to provide them with the care
and attention that they deserve. People forget that the home country had a
great responsibility to care for those of its subject territories. These young
ladies will be well cared for, you need not worry. It might help if some of
them had some nursing skills though. Just to be practical.�

&nbsp;

�OK, now perhaps we can talk about how we
should manage the project. Normally these days we�d let you advise us on
requirements, comment on our plans and so on through our web site but I guess
we could�.�

&nbsp;

He interrupted. �I�m happy with a computer.
Just give me the url the log-on i.d.
and a password.� He could see I was non-plussed. �Listen my boy,� he said, �if you knew how difficult it was to
get hold of pornography in my youth you�d realise that coming to grips with Mr
Gates� abominations is a breeze compared with the benefits provided. I�m
perfectly at home on the Internet.�

&nbsp;

I thought about Basher. It seemed he was
much closer to Kushnati and the Kushtians than to
Anatoly�s vision of a toy owner. I was pretty clear that if we did find him the
girls he wanted we�d not be able to re-sell them.

&nbsp;

Chapter 71 : Island Jaunt

&nbsp;

While Harry and Rick set up the colonial
collection I had my trip set up to see Steve set up. I thought I should let
Kelly know that I wasn�t going to be around for a while and the night I was due
to leave I wasn�t far from her place so I thought I�d drop in.� I tried her mobile a couple of times but
didn�t get a reply.

&nbsp;

I got to her house. It looked as if she was
there. The car was outside and there were lights on. I rang the bell. There
wasn�t any answer but I was sure I could hear people moving around inside. I
rang the bell again, longer this time. Eventually through the frosted glass of
the front door I saw someone coming. 

&nbsp;

Kelly opened the door. Dressed in a black
polo and slacks she looked pretty hot, but she didn�t seem too happy to see me.
�Oh,� she said, �It�s you.�

&nbsp;

�Hmm,� I said. �Not a great welcome. Shall
I go away?�

&nbsp;

Kelly looked apologetic and a little
embarrassed. �Sorry,� she said and then laughed. �It�s just �. Oh look, come on
in, you�ll get the picture.� She led the way up the hall. I shut the door
behind me. 

&nbsp;

We got to the living room and I saw what
she was embarrassed about. Sitting on her living room floor were two helplessly
bound and gagged women. �This is Larry, a friend of mine,� Kelly said to the
two of them. �Don�t worry, he�s cool with this.�

&nbsp;

From the looks on their faces I didn�t
think they were. 

&nbsp;

�Larry, this is Brianna,� Kelly pointed to
a hog-tied red head, rolling from side to side on the floor as she struggled
against the ropes that tied her wrists, ankles, knees and elbows. Her mouth was
filled with a knot tied into the middle of a scarf that was gagging her but she
was still able to communicate that she wasn�t happy with my arrival. �and this is Sue.� Alongside the red head, a girl with short
blond hair was struggling with her own bonds. Both were fully clothed; Sue in a
pale blue dress, Brianna in brown trousers and a cream sweater. Kelly turned
back to me. �Do you want some tea,� she asked impishly. I nodded. She said,
�Have a seat, I won�t be a minute.�

&nbsp;

I sat down on the couch, Kelly�s two
captive friends struggling and mewling at my feet. Kelly was evidently quite
proficient in her use of ropes. Neither of the girls showed much sign of being
able to get free. 

&nbsp;

True to her word, Kelly didn�t take long.
She emerged from the kitchen with two mugs of tea. She sat down on the couch
alongside me.

&nbsp;

�I didn�t have you down for doing the
tying,� I said.

&nbsp;

�It�s not ideal,� said Kelly. �We take
turns.� Brianna and Sue looked distressed that Kelly was discussing things but
they couldn�t really object. �I�m going to be in real trouble when it�s their
go after this.� Brianna gave her an affirming nod. �Still
what the hell.� She leant forward and rolled Sue over on her face. As
she sat back on the couch with her tea, she put her feet on Sue�s bottom, using
her as a foot stool. The girl gave a muffled whimper of protest.� �Now, what can I do for you?� Kelly asked.

&nbsp;

�I don�t know that it�s the best time,� I
said, nodding to the two girls that were still struggling on the floor. �I�m
going to be away for a while, so I thought I�d come and say to look after yourself while I�m away.�

&nbsp;

�That�s nice,� said Kelly. �It�s a shame
though. Maybe you could have come around and tie all three of us up.� Brianna
and Sue took to grunting their protests.

&nbsp;

�Sounds like you have some persuading to
do,� I said, though the idea of the three of them, trussed up for fun had a
considerable appeal. �Look, I�ll leave you to this. I�ll give you a call when I
get back.�

&nbsp;

Kelly looked down at the two helpless
girls. �Yeah,� she said, �It�s probably best. I�ll see you out.�

&nbsp;

We walked out to the hall together. As I
stopped at the door I kissed her. She kissed me back, enthusiastically. �I
meant what I said about the three of us,� she said. �They will have so got off
on this, you know.�

&nbsp;

�And I meant what I said about look after
yourself,� I replied. �I�m not sure how long I�ll be away.�

&nbsp;

�You look after yourself too, then,� she
said, and we parted. 

&nbsp;

The flight out to Barbados
was uneventful � just how I like them. The security routines at the airport
were particularly tedious, especially since I knew that a container was going
out, with a couple of girls doped and helpless, in the hold of the same
aircraft that I was sitting in. �Did you pack your bags yourself, sir?� :
�Yes.� : �Does your checked baggage contain any of the following prohibited
items?� : �No, but there is a 24 year old blonde and a 30 year old brunette
that you might be interested in��� Customs and Immigration at Grantly Addams International were no problem. Then it was
just a short taxi ride down to Bridgetown Harbour in
order to meet up with Steve�s seaplane.

&nbsp;

The pilot put the Beaver down close to the
pier as we taxied in I could see someone waiting in the dusk as the sun set. I
climbed out of the �plane, grabbed my bag from the back seat � no helpless
mewling female cargo this time � and stepped across from the Beaver�s float and
on to the wooden jetty.

&nbsp;

�Hi,� said a voice. �You must be Larry.
Steve asked me to meet you.�

&nbsp;

I looked up from my bag to see the broad
smile of Lady Marchmont. She extended a hand and I
reached forward to take it. �Hi,� I said, puzzled somewhat to see her walking
around without at least some sign of restraints. She was wearing the shortest
of denim cut-offs and a sleeveless shirt tied off under her tits. There were no
cuffs, collars, or shackles that I could see and nowhere to hide them either.

&nbsp;

�Leave the bag, I�ll get someone to get it
later,� she said. She peered at me. �Have we met before?�

&nbsp;

I felt honesty was the best policy. �Mmm,� I said. �You were in hospital in Switzerland and wearing rather a lot of bandages.�

&nbsp;

�Of course. You were pushing the trolley. How did things turn out for those
nurses? They weren�t too terrible to me.�

&nbsp;

I had to confess that I had no idea. The
last time I had seen them was when Harry and I had left them hogtied and
grunting into bandage wad gags on the bed at the clinic. I guessed that Constanza would have been fairly un-amused with them but I
didn�t really know.

&nbsp;

I walked back up the jetty with Lady M.
Steve emerged from the house as we got to the edge of the lawn. Lady M took off
towards him at a run and threw her arms around him. Steve had just managed to
disentangle himself by the time I reached the veranda. He put his hand out.
�Larry,� he called. �Good to see you again. Thought you�d
like to see Angela too.�

&nbsp;

I nodded.

&nbsp;

�You�ll need a drink.� It wasn�t a question
and he knew I didn�t need to answer. �Get us a couple of rum punches, hun,� he said patting Angela�s backside. She wagged a
finger at him disapprovingly but laughed and disappeared into the house. Steve
watched her go. �Now that,� he said, �has to be one of the best purchases, I�ve
made.�

&nbsp;

�I�m glad she�s a success,� I said sitting
myself down in one of the cane chairs. The view from the veranda looked out to
the ocean where the sky at the horizon was fading from dark gold into purple as
the last remnants of the sunset disappeared. �She seems to have adjusted to her
new life remarkably quickly. I thought she might be wearing a collar at least.�

&nbsp;

�She�s an intelligent woman. I explained
how things were. She knows that she can go anywhere she likes on the island.
She has a lot of freedom here but she knows that there is no way off for her
and that if she tried it could be very detrimental to her health. On the other
hand she is treated well. Freddie shared with me some of your thoughts on the
sexualisation programme. We�re using something similar for Angela on a much
smaller scale of course but it seems to work. She�s very receptive to those
ideas and she�s now only too eager to please. I think she�s had a long time of
only pleasing herself. She�s glad of the change.�

&nbsp;

Anglea reappeared from the house carrying a tray with three fruit and
alcohol laden glasses. She put the tray on the table between us and curled up
on the floor beside Steve, resting her head against Steve�s thigh. Steve
reached down to toy with her hair with one hand while he picked up his drink
with the other. I joined him.

&nbsp;

We sat there, not talking, just enjoying
the early evening. Steve and Angela looked relaxed and comfortable with one another.
I downed the last of my punch. �I�ll turn in if that�s OK,� I said. 

&nbsp;

�Sure,� said Steve. �I know what it�s like.
We�ve got an early start tomorrow. There�s a few folk coming in for the
meeting. You�re in the end room. Can you find it?�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� I said, �I remember.� Mainly what I
remembered was that it was where I had first encountered Sukie, It seemed that Steve
had a benign influence on the women he acquired. I waved them goodnight and
headed off into the house.

&nbsp;

The room was just as it was before, the
large fan turning slowly in the ceiling, the white louvered shutters propped on
by a rattan chair. My bag had been unpacked and my things put away. I tossed my
clothes on a chair and fell into bed. 

&nbsp;

I must have laid awake for twenty minutes
or so before I started to doze off so it was through a half asleep haze that I
heard the door to my room open.

&nbsp;

It was Angela. �Steve thought you might
need some help to get to sleep,� she said. I blinked my eyes into focus. The
light from the hall outside, shining through the doorway, threw her into
silhouette. It was clear that she was naked. Suddenly I didn�t feel quite as
sleepy.

&nbsp;

�That would be great,� I said turning back
the bed sheet to invite her in. She slid into the bed alongside me, her hands
on my chest, stroking and running her fingers across my arms. 

&nbsp;

Although she was naked, I soon realised
that almost every part of her body appeared to be adorned with some jewelled
ornament. On her head she wore a chain that held a drop pearl in the centre of
her forehead. Her neck was encircled by a choker necklace with eight strands of
pearls, her arms and ankles carried bracelets and bangles. In each of three piercings in either ear she wore neat gold hoops, those to
the front slightly smaller than those to the back. It was as if Steve was
presenting her as a gift while showing the regard with which he held her,
making the gift more precious still.

&nbsp;

Her love making was as generous as it was
creative, fired with the same energy and will to please that Rachel and Sukie showed. Rather than taking my mind off things, I
ended up feeling homesick. At the end we both fell asleep, her head against my
chest.

Chapter
72 : Island Ideas

&nbsp;

The following day started early. I heard
the drone of aircraft engines as the sun started to stream through the slats of
the shutters. Angela had gone. I pushed back the shutters expecting to see the
Beaver winging in but instead it was a Twin Otter, its two turbo props whining
as it banked around to make its approach into the bay.

&nbsp;

Steve put his head around my door. �We�re
going to start with some breakfast on the veranda, if that�s OK,� he said. 

&nbsp;

I nodded, took a quick shower, pulled on a
shirt and a pair of slacks and headed off to join him.

&nbsp;

Steve and Angela were already there with
their guests when I reached the veranda. I recognised two of them from my last
trip, Narod Jesper and Daphne Challis, the other three
were new to me. Steve introduced them. One woman, two men,
all Americans. They�d each brought their own slaves - five girls
shackled and chained together by their collars were being led shuffling up the
path from the jetty.

&nbsp;

�Well, hi everybody. Thanks for coming
over. I�m sure you�ll have a good few days but I hope you won�t mind if we
spend this morning on some business. Some of you will have met Larry here,�
Daphne and Jesper nodded, �but for those that haven�t he�s working with a bunch
of Brits who are pretty good at sourcing the sort of amusements we all hold
dear. I thought it would be useful to give him some first hand input on how you
guys see things going.�

&nbsp;

The column of shackled girls arrived at the
house, looking uncertain about their surroundings. Their neck chains removed
they each knelt beside their owners. Each equally well trained,
they knew not to interrupt proceedings.

&nbsp;

Jesper kicked things off. He talked about
how he had sourced the half dozen slaves he now had in his collection and
complained about how difficult it was to get slaves with specific skills. He
didn�t seem to know what we�d been doing on customised pick up but there was no
real reason why he should, we hadn�t tried to promote what we�d done in the
States. I talked a bit about the stuff that Rick had done with the web site and
all of Steve�s guests seemed interested. The others chipped in their
experiences. Daphne had had some problems with training new intake and some of
the preparation techniques being used in the States sounded a bit primitive
compared with what we were doing.

&nbsp;

There were, however, two themes that the
group kept coming back to; toys and new sources.

&nbsp;

They were all agreed that the old idea of
slaves for house work was disappearing. What was the point of keeping slaves
for housework, was the general conclusion. Once you
take into account the security costs they are expensive compared with hiring in
and they need too much attention. There might be an argument for slaves for
agricultural work but why not just use the right machinery. What they wanted
slaves for was recreation, for fun. Sometimes (mostly) sexual
but sometimes just for companionship. OK some of the recreation might be
a bit extreme � one of the women�s eyes really lit up as she described the
delight she felt keeping her slave caged under her bed while she fucked one of
her male lovers � but it was recreation nevertheless. They also agreed that hey
were keeping toys for longer than they had kept slaves before. It took time to
find a good one and it wasn�t just a question of the slave�s skills and looks
but once you found one you tended to hang on to them.

&nbsp;

Daphne was holding forth about her
experiences. Narod was looking bored, stroking the hair of the girl kneeling
beside him. Angela and two of Steve�s house-slaves arrived with drinks. I
hadn�t realised it but most of the morning had already gone. I tried to pull
the discussion back to the second point at issue, new sources. 

&nbsp;

�This one,� Narod said, patting the girl at
his side, �is a good example. I found you in cyber
space didn�t I, pet?� The girl nodded. �She was
looking to be owned, looking to be kept and cared for. Of course, she was maybe
looking for something not quite as permanent as she has found but she has at
least found that.� The girl looked around at the others. She was kneeling,
sitting on her haunches beside Narod. She looked a little embarrassed as she
toyed with the chain that ran between her wrists. I could see that she bore a
tattoo with the letters N and J entwined together on her right shoulder. �Now
the good thing,� Narod went on, �is that this young lady was very cheap to
acquire. But,� he stopped. �And it�s a big but. I�ve had to prep and train her
myself. That�s a big job and I�ve not done a lot of it. I�d far rather be able
to acquire willing source through the current channels, properly prepped and
trained but just starting with a willing source. Do you see?��� 

&nbsp;

I nodded. What he was saying fitted in with
some of my own prejudices.

&nbsp;

The others dived in as well. Each outlining their own experiences of trying to use so-called
�willing� sources. By the end of it I could see that there were opportunities
for us, if we wanted to follow them up.

���� 

Chapter
73 : Colonial Collection

&nbsp;

I got back to the UK to
find complete chaos at Heathrow Airport. The place was stuffed full of armed police. They even had armoured
troop carriers lurking around the airport roads. Nobody was saying anything
about what was going on. A security alert was the best I could get anyone to
admit to. The main focus seemed to be on international departures and I didn�t
have any trouble getting out of the airport once we�d been able to find a gate
for our aircraft � with no international flights leaving, the place was filling
up.

&nbsp;

It was the following morning when I heard
what had been going on. Allegedly British intelligence had received a tip off
from �a credible source� that Chechen terrorists intended to attack an aircraft
leaving the UK for Russia. 

&nbsp;

Wherever that tip off came from, it sounded
like they hadn�t found anything or that nothing had been really intended or
whoever was planning the attack had been scared off. It was only later that
evening that I learned that one very large piece of excrement had come into
contact with rotating blades.

&nbsp;

�Kremlin Deny Naked Girl Kidnap� the
headline on billboards outside the underground station said when I emerged from
the office. I picked up a copy of the London Evening News. According to the
article the SVR, Russia�s foreign intelligence service, successors to the KGB, had denied any
involvement in a plot to transport a drugged and naked woman out of the UK in an
airline cargo container. The woman had allegedly been discovered during the
anti-terrorist alert following a baggage and cargo search of an aircraft flying
to St Petersburg. The British Government had refused to comment on security issues,
seemingly bouncing the press between the security services, the police, the
Ministry of Defence, the Foreign Office, the Department of Transport and the
CAA without anyone giving them enough to confirm their suspicions. 

&nbsp;

My first reaction was, �bollocks.� It was
obviously Tricia. She�d been due for shipping while I was in the Caribbean. 

&nbsp;

I had a message from Freddie, which seemed
to confirm my thoughts. �Don�t bother about the current excitement,� it said.
�I�m calling in a few favours.�

&nbsp;

By the next day even the Government had
given up, trying to avoid commenting. The Daily Mirror had found that a girl
had been admitted to hospital near Stansted airport. According to The Mirror,
Stansted was handling a lot of cargo traffic to Russia;
ATRAN Cargo Airlines, a spin off from Aeroflot, was running transports out of
there. Interviews with doctors suggested that the girl was in a seriously
confused state, apparently mentally disturbed, and with no memory of her
identity. The paper had even managed a shot of the cargo container � or at
least a cargo container � it was taken from so far away that in reality it
could have been any of a hundred containers lying around at the airport. The
questioning caption, �Was This Russian Girl�s Flying Prison?� probably deserved
the answer, �Maybe�, �No,� or at best �Who can tell?� but that wasn�t the
point.�� 

&nbsp;

I tried to reach Freddie and then Elly but
I couldn�t get through to either of them. When I found out where they were, I
guess I wasn�t surprised to learn that they had flown out for a meeting with
Anatoly.

&nbsp;

I didn�t think there was much I could do
about it, anyway. If there was anything about Tricia�s trip to point to us,
then I didn�t think our first problem was going to be �what is the right PR
spin to put on this?� 

&nbsp;

I spoke to Rick,
He didn�t think we had too much to worry about. �First,� he said, �she has zero
awareness of what�s happened to her. Freddie had been really keen to get a deep
burn on anything that might relate to her life with us, especially after he
found to that she�d had a briefing from my lot that should have told her the
target was a problem. He got quite cross when he found out she�d had the set of
email intercepts from the Kustenky email as well as the Oblumov one. Tricia had
somehow buried them at the bottom of her files. After that Freddie was pretty
insistent that she got the works. We were really worried about whether she�d
actually be able to function when she got to the other end.�

&nbsp;

�And second?�

&nbsp;

�Second; it�s not one of our containers.�

&nbsp;

How come?� I asked.

&nbsp;

�Anatoly wanted to use one of his own. Said
it would make it easier getting clearance at the other end. Plus Freddie had
agreed with Anatoly that she should be shipped FOB anyway. His team picked her
up from the Prep Centre, we just handed her over naked and clean.� 

&nbsp;

�Is that going to cause difficulty for
him?�

&nbsp;

�His boys over here are hopping mad but
after that business with Litvinenko they reckon that MI5 and the SVR are going
to be tripping over each other enough to keep Anatoly out of the picture.�

&nbsp;

�So what�s the word on the Chechens? Was
this genuine? Where did the tip off come from?�

&nbsp;

�Nobody on Anatoly�s team is saying, even
if they�ve got any idea. My take is that its one of four possibilities. Either
it was a genuine security alert and we were just unlucky. Or someone here
didn�t want to see Tricia go. Or someone�s trying to trip Anatoly up. Or
someone�s trying to make us look dumb.�

&nbsp;

�I don�t buy the second,� I said. �Nobody
seemed that bothered and there would be too big a risk that it would come
whistling back into our organisation. Any of the others could be right.�

&nbsp;

�And I can think of at least one person
that might be interested in making us look dumb.�

&nbsp;

�Who?� I said.

&nbsp;

�Constanza,� Rick said. �Got
to cherchez the old femme, that�s my thought. She�ll be
wanting to cream off as much as she can from the Russian Toy contracts
and she�ll still be pissed about Lady Marchmont.�

&nbsp;

It sounded plausible to me but I didn�t have
any more evidence than the Daily Mirror did. Still, that wouldn�t stop rumours
spreading around the organisation any more than it stopped newspapers writing
good stories.

��� 

I disentangled my self from Rick and went
to talk to Harry about the pick up of the girls for Basher. He didn�t see any
reason to put a hold on it so everything was going ahead as planned. 

&nbsp;

I�m not sure who had come up with the idea.
Maybe it just sprang out of the stuff we�d been doing with video generally and
the sting behind the All Spice pick up all those months ago. Anyway we�d worked
out a plan for the Colonial Collection as it was becoming known.

&nbsp;

I needed to brief Clegg about my trip but I
guessed that he would have plenty on his plates for a while so I sat in on
Colonial Collection to kill some time until he got back.

&nbsp;

Harry ran the briefing session personally.
It was a resource-intensive project but then we were planning to lift twelve
girls in one go and that wasn�t something even Harry�s team did that often.
We�d got the house set up and we�d sent out the invitations. We just had to
wait for the girls to turn up.

&nbsp;

Harry ran through the photos we had of each
of the targets. The research team had chosen them using the basic database that
we had already built up plus some custom work at Heathrow and Gatwick airports.
We�d been able to tap into the CCTV coverage of international arrivals and some
judicious monitoring around the time of landings from Australia,
New Zealand, Canada and so on, we had been able to identify a number of possibles. That
had been followed up by our conventional surveillance and target screening
before any of the girls was approached.

&nbsp;

We�d kept Basher updated through the web
site; he�d been involving himself enthusiastically all the way along. Sebastian
showed me the log of his emails. �Like the look of that one.� �She�ll do.� �Try
to find one with longer legs.� �Mylene � ha, with tits like that they should
call her Melons J � �Like the idea of Miss Monique Devent :
General Wolf had the right idea about French Canadians!!!�

�

Finally we had an agreed list for the next
step. �It�s the opportunity of a lifetime,� the canvassers had said. �Imagine,
Big Brother - but on a global scale. It�s a reality show syndicated live around
the world; right across the English speaking world. It�s a passport to instant,
worldwide, fame.� We�d come up with the idea of �International House� � a TV
show that put girls from arrange of cultures and countries together in one
house for two months. The real hook for viewers was that the whole thing was
going to be kept secret until everyone was already in the house and the
programme was about to start; that way (we said), we�d build up a real cult
status among those that get into it from day 1. 

&nbsp;

We showed the girls the promotional
material that we planned to use once the programme started. �The International
House � 12 House Mates � 12 Nations � One World - One Winner� the ads said. We
made a big thing of the housemates being part of a demonstration of the ways in
which different cultures could get along. That was why they were their by
invitation, we said. But also, it must be said, we didn�t under emphasis the
opportunity for global TV exposure or the $250,000 prize money. We only needed
18 approaches to get our 12 house mates. (The other six are on a list back in
the Prep Centre somewhere, it seemed a shame to waste
the research. We told them afterwards that the whole idea had fallen through).

&nbsp;

With the lift team briefed we headed off to
the house. We�d set it up with a few (not very well).hidden cameras for the
girls to find but the basic premise was that it was a normal London house,
except that the girls would have no access to the outside world. They�d been
told to tell people they�d be away for two months but they absolutely couldn�t
tell anyone where they were going: that would have made them ineligible for the
prize.,

&nbsp;

They started to turn up in the middle of
the afternoon by 4
 o�clock, as requested,
they were all assembled in the house�s living room. Even the dimmest of them
worked out there was something strange from the start; there were thirteen of
them. We�d put Eva in as part of the team to oil the wheels.

&nbsp;

We were monitoring their discussions from
the Porta-Cabin that had been installed in the garden as a studio. 

&nbsp;

�Hey, I�m Mylene,� one of the taller girls
said smiling and giving a wave to the others. �I guess I�m representing �Oz if
we�re all from different places.�

&nbsp;

The others all pitched in with their names
and their home countries. �Tsai Lin � Hong Kong,�;
Angie � Canada, Lucy � New
  Zealand, Eva � I�m
from the UK, and so on.

&nbsp;

Angie mentioned the odd number of
participants first of all. �Weren�t there supposed to be twelve of us?� she
said.

&nbsp;

Yes, you�re right,� cut in Eva, �that�s
odd. Maybe another country signed up for broadcasting rights or something and
insisted on having a representative.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, could be,� said Mylene, �or it could
be part of whatever�s going to go on here. You don�t think they are just going
to turn the cameras on and leave us to get on with it do you? There will be all
sorts of weird things going on before the winner gets out of here, believe me.�

&nbsp;

All of the girls looked up as Harry entered
the living room in his role of master of ceremonies. �Good afternoon, ladies,�
he said, in his most avuncular tone. �As we discussed in your briefing sessions
you�ll have a day before the cameras are turned on.�

&nbsp;

�Like we believe that,� the microphones
picked up Mylene muttering beneath her breath. In the control room one of the
sound engineers gave me a thumbs up sign, �See, pick up is sensitive enough,�
he smirked.

&nbsp;

We�d invited Basher along too. Well, not so
much invited as acquiesced in his instance to be there. Harry had not been keen, Basher had said he wanted to be sure they�d be alright
when he saw them in the flesh. I was worried in case he wanted to reject any
then but he claimed that wasn�t the case. In the end we�d compromised
; he could turn up for the girl�s arrival but he�d go before we did the
lift. �Colonel Snell here is representing our main UK
sponsor,� Harry explained introducing Basher. He beamed at the girls from his
wheel chair. �I�m sure you�ll join me in thanking him and his organisation for
making this show possible.� The girls smiled tolerantly but without much
enthusiasm. 

&nbsp;

Basher grinned back. �It�s a great treat to
have you all here,� he said. �Such a delight to have
representatives of some many places.� He pointed to one of the girls. �You. Where are you from?�

&nbsp;

A dark haired, rather studious looking girl
responded, �Boston, Colonel,� in a quiet New
 England accent.

&nbsp;

�Ah,� said Snell, �excellent. Our representative from the Province of Massachusetts Bay.� The girl looked
puzzled at this reference to her home�s old colonial name.� �Well, stay away from the tea my dear. And
you others, �Rhodesia,� the girl from Zimbabwe
looked affronted, �The Malay States, and you dear where are you from?�

&nbsp;

�Dahka, Colonel,� the girl said politely.

&nbsp;

�Ah, yes, East Pakistan,� Basher
responded cheerily.

&nbsp;

�We call it Bangladesh, now, Sir,� the girl said. �We are an independent country, no
longer part of Pakistan.�

&nbsp;

�Hmm, too popular an idea, independence,�
Basher said. �You�ll soon find out you need to depend on each other and on the
mother country too.�

&nbsp;

I looked along the line of girls. Basher�s
intervention was clearly disturbing them and he was in danger of spooking one
or more of our house mates. I decided to interrupt. �Well, Colonel,� I said,
�we need to get things going.�

&nbsp;

Basher span his wheel chair around. �Quite, quite, Barry, my lad,� he beamed.
You get these young gels started off. Don�t mind my ramblings.�

&nbsp;

Mylene, the Aussie girl walked across the
room to join Eva. As she passed Basher�s wheel chair, she seemed to jump about
six inches into the air before landing again clutching her backside. She gave
Basher an accusatory look as she joined the other girls. I thought I saw the
trace of a smirk across Basher�s face for an instant before it resumed its
normal impassive stare. I overheard Mylene hiss under her breath to one of the
others, �He�s a real pervert. I caught him staring at my backside when I was
looking in the mirror earlier on. And he�s always got his hands in his pockets,
I�m sure he�s playing with himself. He makes my flesh creep.�

&nbsp;

Harry went on with the introduction. �So
you�ll be able to have a relaxing evening, get yourselves settled in, choose
your room mates � you�ll be sharing four to a room � and get yourselves a meal.
There�s plenty of food in the pantry and you�ll find plenty of drink as well.
Now, I�m going to leave you to get on with things. Don�t forget you can use the
�Speak To The World� room at any time if you want to
talk to any of us. Remember this show is all about showing how well people from
different parts of the world can get along together. Whoever wins, I�m sure
you�ll all want to be seen as ambassadors for your countries but whatever
happens I hope you all have a great time. Enjoy yourselves.�

&nbsp;

There was a small ripple of applause from
some of the girls. Harry smiled and asked if there were any questions. There
weren�t. �Well, I leave you to it then,� he said. �Good luck.�

&nbsp;

Chapter
74 : Colonial Reality

&nbsp;

Harry was sat at the bank of CCTV monitors
watching the girls in the house. He looked bored. There wasn�t much going on.
The girls had all had a good go at the drinks cupboard and now they were
sleeping it off. �Do people actually watch this stuff on their televisions?�
Harry asked.

&nbsp;

I nodded. �Yepp.
It�s pretty popular in the real world. But then getting to vote someone out on
a reality show is probably the closest a lot of people get to having the sort
of control over someone else that our clients take for granted. Maybe the
desire for �ownership� is more deeply seated than we know.�

&nbsp;

�Given the choice between a dozen sleeping
women and your ideas of philosophy, I think I�ll go with the women,� he said,
turning back to the monitors.

&nbsp;

I felt he was being a bit unkind but it had
been a long day. �I�m not sure I understand why you don�t just scoop them up
straight away,� I said.

&nbsp;

�It would be easier,� said Harry, �but I�m
pursuing a cock-up prevention programme on this one. Given that they�ve been
told to tell no one where they�ve gone we�re just going to sit on the house for
a few days to make sure that they really have been good girls and that there
aren�t any tabloid journalists sniffing around for a story.�

&nbsp;

Basher was getting impatient. We managed to
pacify him by letting him have tapes of some of the sessions in the �Speak To The World� room where the girls poured out their hearts
and their innermost thoughts and fears to the camera. I could imagine Basher
would be watching them with only one hand on the TV remote. 

&nbsp;

As it was we waited a week, just to give
the Sundays their chance too, but there wasn�t a sniff. Harry�s team had been
checking out their homes too and it all looked O.K. The pick up itself we
organised so that we could take them one at a time. I guess we could have
walked in with machine guns at the ready but there�s always a risk that
something will go wrong and Harry likes safer approaches. 

&nbsp;

The girls had been used to having some sort
of competition in the afternoons. The first few days they�d won access to a
case of wine on one night, the use of a CD player for an evening on another and
a fancy party on a third. 

&nbsp;

For this task we�d installed a tube that
ran from their lounge through to a hidden internal room and they had been told
that they had to decide which order they would go through the tube. They�d all
been given uniform, short-sleeved, white shirt-waister dresses with their
country�s logo embroidered on the breast pocket. �No prizes for guessing why
we�ve got these,� Angie said as she looked at how short the skirt of her dress
was. �They�ll be looking for great arse shots as we crawl into that pipe, won�t
they?� 

&nbsp;

One girl was to go as soon as the first
green light came on. Then a red light would come on until it was time for the
next to and so on. There was more debate than I�d expected. It turned out that
Mylene was quite claustrophobic and the others had to persuade her that she
really had to do it or they�d lose out on whatever treat
the producers had in store for them.

&nbsp;

As a result Mylene was the first to go into
the tube and the first to emerge into the hidden room. Once she started
exploring that she found a door to another room. As she went through into the
dark room beyond, the door slammed shut and locked behind her and she was
grabbed by some of Harry�s team. Within moments she was handcuffed, ball
gagged, ankle shackled and carried out. The others followed, each crawling into
the tube when the green light came on. Eva was the fourth one through but, of
course, avoided the reception that the others had to endure.

&nbsp;

At the end of half an hour all twelve girls
were wriggling helplessly, standing up, chained by the neck in the trailer that
they had thought contained the program�s broadcast equipment.� 

&nbsp;

Eva wheeled Basher up a ramp and into the
trailer. The girls� distress and agitation became even more evident as they
realised not only that they had been abducted but who had commissioned their
kidnapping. The fact that he was grinning like a five year old child in a candy
store probably didn�t help.��� 

&nbsp;

Basher waved Eva away and wheeled himself
along the line inspecting each of the girls closely in turn. He stopped
alongside Mylene.

&nbsp;

Basher reached up to the right breast of
the girl standing beside his wheel chair. You will excuse me, my dear,� he
said, �my eye sight is not what it used to be.� He ran
his fingers lightly across the embroidered badge on her breast pocket. She
flinched involuntarily at his touch earning a rap from his stick across her
shins. He resumed his touching, eventually deciding
that the embroidered form represented a kangaroo. �Ah,� he said, �the
Australian representative. You�re going to be suffering for the prowess of your
cricketers, I am afraid, my dear. And by the way,� he reached up again groping
at the girls full breasts, �you can get used to me touching you young lady,
I�ve no intention of letting a pair of tits like these go to waste.�

&nbsp;

He grunted with satisfaction and moved off
along the line. Each of the girls suffered some indignity or other at Basher�s
hands. Tsai Linn, worst of all, was almost stripped of her dress by the
enthusiastic, orgiastic Snell. �Very nice,� he commented when he had got to the
end. �I can hardly wait for you to finish your preparation work. Oh by the way,
I�d like them all to be blondes by the time they are delivered. I much prefer
blondes.�

&nbsp;

�Basher,� I said, �that might be a bit of a
challenge for the representatives from Hong Kong, Nigeria, India,
and Pakistan mightn�t it?�

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry about it looking too natural,�
Basher smirked, �I�ve always quite liked a tarty look on a girl. I�m sure
you�ll manage it.� He rolled his chair down the ramp and out of the trailer. We
hitched up the trailer and headed off to the Prep Centre. Some of Harry�s team
stayed behind to clear up in the house.

Chapter 75 : An Offer You Might Refuse

&nbsp;

The preparation of Basher�s colonial harem
was well under way. I was back in the Whitechapel office. I finally got a
chance, albeit fleeting, to talk to Clegg.

&nbsp;

�How was the meeting with Anatoly?� I
asked. �Is there anything I need to do?�

&nbsp;

Freddie shook his head. �No,� he said. �we are clean as far as I can tell. Elly
had a conversation her contact in the National Crime Squad to try to get a fix
on what�s going on. Apparently, in the best tradition of detective novels, the
police are baffled. The press have lost interest since as far as they can tell
there�s no evidence of any government cover up or incompetence and that�s the
only thing they seem to want to write about. Beside the story is all of two
weeks old; so what chance is there of anyone remembering it?�

&nbsp;

�And how�s Anatoly?�

&nbsp;

�Spitting mad - but not
at us. I reckon he half thinks there might have
been a genuine Chechen plot but he�s also worried because the container
malfunctioned.�

&nbsp;

�Malfunctioned?�

&nbsp;

�Yes. Anatoly�s got his transport
containers tricked up so if you open them the wrong way they dump a lethal dose
into the veins of whosoever happens to be inside. Tricia should be dead by all
accounts. Anatoly�s relieved we think she was completely wiped and worried in
case he�s got a bad apple in his own team.�

&nbsp;

�What�s your view?�

&nbsp;

Clegg looked impassive. He sucked in his
breath slowly and shook his head.

&nbsp;

�Constanza?� I asked.

&nbsp;

�Oh, I�m sure she would never consider such
a thing.� It was Elly�s voice. She had come into the
office behind me. She managed to say it in a way that made me think that she
felt Constanza might well be guilty of considering
such a thing and then doing something after the considering.

&nbsp;

Freddie took the opportunity to use the
interruption to change the subject. �How was the visit to Steve?�

&nbsp;

I filled him in on the trip. He actually
seemed a bit more interested than I expected but I didn�t get very far on tying
him down to doing anything about it. I felt a bit frustrated that I wasn�t
getting anywhere with our discussions. Elly just
smiled as I left Freddie�s office. �Don�t worry,� she said, �he�ll take it on
board. He just likes to think things through.��
�

&nbsp;

I was back in my office when the phone
rang. �Hi,� said Brad when I picked up the phone. The line was crackly and
Brad�s voice sounded as though there were several socks spliced into the wires
between him and me.� 

&nbsp;

�I wondered if we could have a chat. The
Trade Minister has had some thoughts and he thinks your business could help us.
Why don�t you come over? He�s got some time at the end of the week if you�re
free.�

&nbsp;

�When you say come over, you�re not talking
about the Castle are you?� I asked, sensing that even allowing for the usual
problems with telephones here, the British Telecom were unlikely to have found
a way on incorporating a two second time lag between London and Worcestershire.

&nbsp;

�Ah, no, Kolin actually. Don�t worry
about the flight, there�s an air force transport leaving Stansted
tomorrow if you can be on it.�

�

I wasn�t sure that Kushtian military
aviation was likely to be any better than the civil sort but at least there
wouldn�t be any pretence at comfort and security would probably be more than
adequate. �Sure,� I said. I was happy to oblige, particularly if it led to some
more business. I told Sukie and Rachel that I would
be away again for a few days, both of them looked worried. I tried to reassure
them, Elly agreed to keep an eye on them while I was
away and that seemed to comfort them. Ownership is a real responsibility. I
didn�t think I could just send them down to the cells as though they were being
kennelled and besides, Rachel had work to do. 

&nbsp;

The Kushtian Air Force flight was, well, an
experience. It wasn�t quite as bad as I thought when I walked up the ramp at the
back of the Ilyushin 76 into its cavernous hold, half
empty, half filled with crates of indeterminate origin. I was staring around
looking for something that resembled a seat and beginning to think I�d have to
do the flight standing up or propped against a crate when a voice called from
the front of the hold.

&nbsp;

�Mr Ross? This way please.�

&nbsp;

I walked the length of the aircraft�s hold.
A woman in the blue serge uniform of the Kushtian Air Force stood at the foot
of a short metal ladder. She gestured for me to climb it.

&nbsp;

At the top of the ladder I became more
encouraged. A cabin with some twenty seats in it had been built into the front
of the hold behind the flight deck. It looked a great deal more luxurious than
I would normally have expected for a military aircraft. The reclining seats
looked as if they had been bought by the Kushtians the last time that Virgin
refitted their first class cabin. At least I might get a reasonable sleep. A
smiling officer emerged from the flight deck. �Mr Ross, welcome,� he said.
�We�ll be taking off shortly. Do take a seat. Anywhere you like.�

&nbsp;

�Just me?� I asked.

&nbsp;

The officer nodded. �Yes,� he said. �Don�t
worry though. We�ll try to look after you. Aerina Kolanka Kuslanis will take care
of anything you need.�

&nbsp;

I chose a seat about half way back in the
cabin and strapped myself in. Kolanka � I assumed
that Aerina was her rank rather than her first name �
appeared at the top of the ladder and closed the hatch. She smiled at me and
took her place on a fold down jump-seat beside the flight deck door. As she
tightened the straps of her harness I could see that beneath her uniform jacket
was a body of interesting possibility. The engines fired into life with a cough
and splutter that did little to encourage belief that they would keep going
until we reached Kushtia. Aerina Kuslanis
seemed unconcerned, however, and I took some comfort from that.

&nbsp;

The flight was largely uneventful. Kolanka proved immune to such charms as I could muster. Her
uniform remained depressingly well buttoned up for the entire flight.

&nbsp;

When I got there, Brad and the Trade
Minister were sitting waiting for me in the lounge. Brad suggested that we go
through to the pool bar. �I hope you enjoyed your trip here,� the Minister
said.

&nbsp;

�It was fine,� I said, �the Kushtian Air
Force seems to have its operations well organised.� 

&nbsp;

�Yes,� he said. �At least
the transport.�

&nbsp;

�And how is the economic development
programme going?�

&nbsp;

�Quite well, I think. Up
to a point. The Emir here has found a number of companies that it will
prove most beneficial for us to work with and of course our relationship with
your business has worked very much as we had hoped.�

&nbsp;

�I�m glad things are working out well,
Minister. Can I ask how the last concubine we arranged for your use has turned
out?�

&nbsp;

The Minister chuckled. �Ah,
yes, your diplomatic baggage! Miss Argyll, wasn�t she called?� I nodded.
The last I had seen of Cora Argyll was sitting shackled and gagged in a cell
under the Minister�s House.�� �She has
proved most accommodating after her initial reservations had been overcome. I
have found her to be a most useful diversion from the cares of office.� I
smiled. �But how are you? You managed to avoid the attentions of those that
were seeking to disturb your operations?�

&nbsp;

�I did indeed, Minister. All is resolved.�
I looked across at the pool, two girls, naked except for their collars, were
swimming back and forth with two rather over weight men. �And the Emir�s
facility is proving an asset?�

&nbsp;

�Somewhat,� said the Minister. �It has been
useful to get us started but I believe we will be suspending our operations
there. Let us just say we are learning more about the niceties of international
trade and we would not wish to be felt to be trampling on local cultural
differences. Still, I understand you were able to provide some excellent staff.
Those two for example,� he pointed to the girls in the pool, �have been a great
help.� I realised it was Karen and Peta, the two
volley ball players. �Very athletic; most capable entertainers of those we wish
to influence. They are here to learn a little of true Kushtian culture first
hand. They too came by Air Force jet, but with less comfortable accommodation
than your own.� I thought back to the crates arrayed in the hold of the Ilyushin and wondered whether there had been any on my
flight. They hadn�t looked as though they were as well equipped as Clegg and
Anatoly�s cargo containers.� 

&nbsp;

Brad waved to the bar, to get us some
drinks. Greetje Van Bruijn
came teetering across wearing stilt-high heels, her collar and nothing else.
Each of us asked for a beer and she disappeared to get them. �Such a nice
arse,� said Brad appreciatively.

&nbsp;

�How�s your engagement present from� Kushnati?�
I asked.

&nbsp;

Brad gave a self satisfied grin. �Let�s
just say I�m enjoying playing with a doll for the first time in my life.�

&nbsp;

�And Lauren? How�s she coping with Kushtia.�

&nbsp;

�Ha, more like how�s Kushtia coping with
her,� the Minister interjected.

&nbsp;

Brad looked embarrassed. �My daughter has
yet to adopt all of the ways of Kushtian women,� he said diplomatically.

&nbsp;

�There are suggestions of terrible
scandals,� the Minister said conspiratorially with a smile. �The corridors of
every council members offices are buzzing with gossip
about her flagrant infidelity. It has quite cheered the place up.�

&nbsp;

Greetje reappeared with the drinks. Brad clicked his fingers to indicate
she should kneel between us. He balanced the tray on her back, she made a
convenient table.

&nbsp;

�Like you said Brad, daughters are a rule
to themselves. Still what was it you to wanted to discuss?�

&nbsp;

Brad looked at the Minister who seemed to
indicate that he should take the lead. �Well Larry,� he began, �There�s three
projects that are going to need support. Firstly Kushtia is now trying to
encourage inward investment from Japan and
other Far Eastern countries. One of the incentives that they
planning to offer Japanese businessmen is access to certain special hotels, run
by slaves, where room service takes on a new meaning. We�ve learned a
lot operating this place. We�ll mainly use Kushtian girls for the staff but
we�ll want a number of western girls for entertainment purposes and Brits seem
like as good a bet as any.� 

&nbsp;

I didn�t see any problem with that. I was
thinking back to the files that we had found in Cindy�s car. There had been
half a dozen of them that had been young and female buyers of sports cars. From
what I remembered of them they�d be ideal. And Cindy had been meticulous in
building up a profile of each of her clients. Rick couldn�t have done a better
job. She�d also made a note of who it was that was actually paying for the car;
husband, boyfriend, doting father. 

&nbsp;

�The other opportunity we�ve spotted is the
whole off-shore call centre business. Plenty of British firms seem keen to
outsource their call centre operations. We reckon that we can use girls from there
as a way of providing low cost off-shore resources while still offering native
English speakers as a way of ensuring good customer service. You know how it is
with some of these off-shore call centres, you get to know pretty quickly that
you�re talking to a foreign country and people don�t like it. Of course they�ll
need some fairly heavy preparation, being on the telephone to the outside
world, you see.� 

&nbsp;

I liked the idea but it seemed completely
reckless to me. Unless they were going to prep their operators to the point of
catatonia the whole thing would be too risky and if they did then the girls
would just sound like robots. On the other hand maybe that wouldn�t be so
different from some of the call centres I�d encountered. Maybe there was
something in it; I�d got irritated myself by talking to people who just didn�t
seem to understand what I was on about. On the other hand it sounded like the
volumes might be greater than we were interested in getting involved in even if
it was feasible. �What�s the third project?� I said.

&nbsp;

�Well, it�s an extension of the outsourcing
idea,� Brad began.

&nbsp;

The Trade Minister interrupted. �We wish to
make sure that Kushtia benefits from the digital age. Kushtia must build a
knowledge economy,� he said. �There is an explosion in technology.
Unfortunately our universities have been late to recognise this but we cannot
wait. If we do not act we will be overtaken by others in our region.�

&nbsp;

�So what do you intend.�

&nbsp;

�We will build a software factory. We
intend to provide a software development service based in Kushtia with very
advantageous labour rates. I think there are sufficient companies that will not
ask too many questions about how we provide our resources if they can get the
work done at the cheapest costs. We understand that you have had some
experience in doing something similar.� 

&nbsp;

I thought back to Sebastian�s collection of
�web slaves� and nodded.�� 

&nbsp;

�Do you think that Clegg Enterprises can
source the necessary products?�

&nbsp;

�Well,� I said, �in principal, yes. I
wouldn�t want you to feel that we weren�t interested in helping with this. On
the other hand, it will depend on the volumes. You know that we are mainly
working with low volume, high value projects these days. We will need to look
at how we deal with this. It might be better for one of our associate companies
to handle this.� I was worried by the idea of high volume / low value work but
I didn�t want to turn them down flat. �I am assuming that you are seeking
females for these tasks?�

&nbsp;

�Indeed,� said the Minister. �We understand
how to manage women in Kushtia as you know. These projects simply represent a
logical extension of one of what I believe you marketing people call our core
competencies.� The Minister smirked. 

&nbsp;

�I am sure you will create a completely
unique working environment for your recruits,� I said. By now I was becoming
increasingly convinced that the Kushtians had gone completely mad. 

&nbsp;

The Trade Minister smiled. �Yes,� he said.
�That�s why I have another proposition. But for you;
personally.� I looked puzzled. �This programme will create a large pool
of foreign labour within Kushtia,� he said. �We are most anxious to see that
our culture is not diluted, not contaminated, by this influx. There is a
benefit from low cost labour of course but we wish to avoid the problems of
westernisation that could arise from so many of these girls being brought to
our country. We want to appoint someone as Director of Overseas Resources; someone
to take a role in ensuring that our incomers become well adapted to Kushtian
ways. We think you could perform that role for us. You would also have
responsibility for oversight of the UNESCO cultural transfer programme.�

&nbsp;

I was flattered and said so, but I was
uncertain about the idea, even if I had been looking for another job. �I�m not
sure I see it as a problem and, in any case, surely a Kushtian would be better
for that role,� I said. �Someone that is clearly identified
with your own culture.�

&nbsp;

�No,� said Brad, adding his weight to the
argument. �What this needs is an outsider to champion the Kushtian way. I�d
consider it myself but I�m only just getting things set up here and besides,
I�m a Kushtian really by blood.�

&nbsp;

�So many slaves together may find ways to
hang on to their old culture. To cling to dreams of their
previous lives. That will not help our projects. Consider it,� said the
Minister. �You could bring your wife. You do have a wife?� I shook my head. �No matter. Your concubines then.
Perhaps you�ll find a good Kushtian girl.�

&nbsp;

�I�ll think about it,� I said. �But I�m not
sure if it�s what I want to do.�

&nbsp;

Chapter 76: Party Time

&nbsp;

Brad was standing at the front of the room
holding forth to the assembled crowd. Since I knew most of them the effusive
introduction was unnecessary but none the less welcome.

&nbsp;

It was good to see them again. The Trade
Minister had Cora Argyll in tow, literally. Cora was hardly recognisable.
Wearing a long, full skirt but naked from the waist up, her entire torso, arms,
face and shaven head were covered with elaborate tattoos. The Trade Minister
was leading her by a chain that ran to a ring set in the septum of her nose. It
was only as she came alongside that I saw that the piercing had itself been set
with a silver grommet to prevent the ring causing damage. I asked the Minister
about the designs on her body.

&nbsp;

�Do you know about the Pythork?�
he asked. 

&nbsp;

I searched my memory and eventually
remembered the incident at the Castle. �The ritual snake
dance?�

&nbsp;

�Yes. For us it is a potent symbol. A symbol of life and regeneration. In the eastern
countryside the barren nature of the land means there are few snakes. They
tattoo their women this way to summon their spirit. These are their traditional
designs.�

&nbsp;

I looked more closely at the swirling
patterns that curled around Cora�s body. There were indeed stylised snakes,
intricately wound about each other like the patterns on some Saxon illuminated
manuscript. Forked tongues twined around each of her cheeks. The head of a
cobra was pictured on her forehead, its tongue reaching down to the tip of her
nose.

&nbsp;

Cora knelt, docile, beside the Minister.
�Did you discover her reasons for conspiring to abduct you?� he asked. I nodded
but felt unwilling to share them. There was little pointing washing the Clegg
Organisation�s dirty linen with its customers. �Yes,� I said. �It is all
resolved now.�

&nbsp;

The Minister smiled respecting my
discretion.

&nbsp;

�Is this the sort of thing you�re looking
to develop with your cultural transfer programme?� I asked.� 

&nbsp;

The Minister chuckled. �Nothing so extreme,
my friend,� he said, �or at least as far as the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organisation is concerned. We are hopeful of getting funding for
our programme. They are beginning to understand the importance of protecting
endangered cultures, just as World Wildlife Fund seeks to protect endangered
species. Let�s say we are hopeful.�� 

&nbsp;

The Kalinin�s son was
there as well but with Emma and Ginger instead of Victoria as I had
expected. �Most extraordinary,� he confided in me. �There has been some scandal
about my wife, Victoria. It is rumoured she has been involved in most
exceptional activities. That some members of the council have indulged in the
most shameful acts with her. We thought it best if she stayed out of the public
eye for a while.� He winked. �But I am sure that all will be shown to have been
above board.�

&nbsp;

�You think she will be shown to be
innocent?�

&nbsp;

�Innocent is not a word I would use about Victoria,� he
laughed. �Let us say she will be shown merely to have indulged the perverse
demands of a few corrupt individuals, fearful that failing to accommodate her
husband�s colleagues would jeopardise his position. After all no woman would
initiate such actions.�

&nbsp;

�Do you know what the greatest scandal is?�
Emma asked.

&nbsp;

�I dread to think.�

&nbsp;

�Victoria is
rumoured to have fitted herself with an artificial penis and to have used it to
perform a sexual act upon one of the members of the Council.�

&nbsp;

�Don�t be absurd, Emma,� the Kalinin�s son
chided but with a smile at me. �Such a thing is nonsense. How could it be? What
nonsense you women gossip about.��� 

&nbsp;

At the far end of the room sat Kushnati Koresh, his new wife in
attendance. Lauren was dressed demurely, sitting quietly beside her husband
while he raucously grabbed at drink and food from passing serving girls. She
even seemed accepting of his grabbing at the girls as well. She saw me, spoke
to her husband and walked slowly across to where I was standing beside the Kalinin�s son.

&nbsp;

Emma laughed. �You will need to speak to
her first,� she said. �No Kushtian woman will speak first to a man.�

&nbsp;

�Lauren,� I said, accepting my cue. �How is
married life?�

&nbsp;

Lauren relaxed and smiled impishly, the
proprieties having been observed. �Let�s say that the wedding vows still have
enough loopholes to let me have some fun. And some of Kushnati�s
tribe have turned out to be really rather good companions. Very
healthy, very physical, very much fun. They don�t speak much English of
course and my Kushtian is still not good but we manage to get by. I�m learning
a lot.�

&nbsp;

I didn�t think she just meant the language.

&nbsp;

�And how are your personal slaves?� I said,
thinking of Toos and Femke.


&nbsp;

�Working their little butts off,� Lauren
smirked. �Keeps them too tired to think about trying to get
into the pants of any of the bucks around the place. They look after me
pretty good though � they�ve worked out that�s the way for as quiet a life as
they�re going to get. Plus,� she said, �and this bit is a real hoot, Kushnati�s letting his tongue hang out for them.�

&nbsp;

�How is that good?�

&nbsp;

Lauren looked around conspiratorially.
�Let�s say unrequited passion is not good for the old man�s blood pressure and
for a husband to take advantage of his wife�s slave girl would be a great
disgrace. Sometimes you can see the red mist rising in his eyes! I�m looking forward to the inheritance.� She waved her fingers
at her husband. �Gotta go see the gimmer,� she said, �time to start working on his blood
pressure.� She smoothed down her tunic to show off her figure and
grinned when she saw the effect it had on her husband. �See you!�

&nbsp;

I watched as she slid back across the room
to where her husband was waiting. �That doesn�t sound like my understanding of
the Kushtian laws of inheritance,� I said to the Kalinin�s son.

&nbsp;

�I think you are right my friend,� he said,
�but it will suit some for a vacancy to appear in the Elders and perhaps there
are those that have misled Kushnati�s wife in order
to serve their own ends.�

&nbsp;

I was beginning to understand more about
Kushtian politics but I needed to get back to London.

Chapter 77 : Futures &amp; Options

&nbsp;

I felt that I really had to talk to Freddie
before I made a decision. I mean he had brought me into the business, albeit in
a rather underhand way, and he�d given me a lot of support. He�d arranged for
us to meet at the club where he�d first suggested that I might join his team. 

&nbsp;

As I walked in I saw Colonel Snell in his
wheelchair scooting across the lobby in the direction of the lift. He skidded the chair to a halt and swang
around to face me. �Garry!� he boomed (a memory for names and indeed
discretion, I suspect were not his strongest attributes). �Good to see you,
young man. Clegg�s leant me a couple of rooms here while I�m in town.�

&nbsp;

�Hullo,� I said. �how
are things in the colonies?�

&nbsp;

Snell grinned conspiratorially. �As they
should be, young man, as they should be! Here, help me up to my room, will
you?�

&nbsp;

I thought he was well able to manage but he
seemed keen for me to accompany him. I pushed his chair into the lift. He
prodded the button for the fourth floor with the end of his walking stick. The
ancient lift gave a shudder and started upwards with a whine of an electric
motor and a hiss of cable. It stopped at the fourth floor without taking the
trouble to slow down first. Snell�s chair bounced and fell back with a thump.
He didn�t seem bothered. I pushed him out of the lift and took the route
indicated by the gestures of his stick down the corridor. Confronted by one of
the club�s room maids, he waved her aside with the stick. �Stand clear, girl,�
he bellowed. �Coming through!�

&nbsp;

The suite that Clegg had provided for Snell
was comfortably appointed but its main feature was the tableau provided by the
three helpless members of Snell�s colonial harem. Mylene
was there, tied kneeling by the side of Basher�s bed; naked from the waist up,
mouth wrenched wide by a Hodgkinson gag. Ropes tied
around the base of her tits had forced them into the shape of distended globes;
the nipples bruised and reddened. On Basher�s bedside table were the implements
responsible for the tortured look of her tits, clamps, pinchers and a pair of
pin wheels. Basher wheeled across to beside Mylene.
She squealed at his approach. He responded by widening her gag another notch.
�I fear your team just took another three wickets, my dear,� he said, causing her
to squeal more and wriggle against the ropes that held her; she evidently knew
that good news for the Australian cricket team was bad news for her. �You�ll
have to take the consequences of that in a little while.�

&nbsp;

Kneeling on the other side of the bed,
Angie, the Canadian, was trussed to a wooden frame. She was still wearing a
short white dress like that all the girls had been dressed in when they were in
the International House; after a few weeks of wear, it was now dirty and torn.
Although ropes held her firmly against the frame her arms stretched out across
the bed, her wrists shackled and joined by a short length of chain. From the
way she was positioned and the array of oils, gels and creams on the table
beside her, it was obvious that Angie�s main role was to provide Basher with
his regular doses of masturbation. 

&nbsp;

A third girl stood beside the bed. Basher
waved towards her. �Did you meet my little kiwi?� he said. �Makes a very good
little waitress, don�t you, Lucy my dear?� The slight, dark eyed, girl nodded
warily, prevented from answering by the ball gag that filled her mouth. Basher
turned back towards me, �I�m sure she�ll manage to atone for the faults of her
countryman.�

&nbsp;

�Countryman?� I asked, knowing that this would only lead to another diatribe from
the xenophobic Snell. 

&nbsp;

�Jackson, Peter Jackson,� Basher said with
a sneer. �Has the nerve to take an English story and high-jack it to the
southern hemisphere. Tolkien�s part of our cultural legacy,� he snapped,
�what�s a New Zealander doing filming it down there? He should have brought it
here. Heaven knows his parents were English! Disgraceful.�
He seemed to calm down a little. �Can she get you a drink?�

&nbsp;

I shook my head, �Sorry Basher, I can�t
stop,� I said. �I�m seeing Freddie.�

&nbsp;

�Fair enough,� said Snell. �Tell him I�m
happy with this lot and thanks for the rooms. Now help me up on to the bed, can
you?�

&nbsp;

I leant him my arm and allowed him to lever
himself up from his chair and onto the bed. Lucy went to draw the covers over
him. He waved his hand. �No, no,� he said. �Just unzip my trousers and put some
baby oil on her hands,� he nodded towards the helpless Angie. �I feel in need
of a little relaxation before I turn my attentions to Mylene
here.�

&nbsp;

I�ll leave you to it,� I said, waving to
Basher. He nodded and lay back on the bed to receive the ministrations of the
girls.�� 

&nbsp;

I made my way down to the room that Freddie
was using. Elly was there too.

&nbsp;

I explained about the Minister�s offer. I�d
expected him to be pretty angry. I mean, I�ve never liked customers poaching my
staff. Instead his response was measured, thoughtful. �Hmm,� he said, putting
the ball back into my court. �What do you
want to do?� 

&nbsp;

�Well, Freddie,� I said. �On the face of
it, it�s a great opportunity. I�ve got on well with all the people that I�ve
met there and, if I�m blunt, it offers me a lifestyle I couldn�t hope to
maintain here. I mean I know you�ve been very supportive over Sukie and Rachel but I�m realistic enough to know that we
can�t sustain that sort of indulgence here, even though I enjoy it. On the
other hand I would hate to leave Sukie and Rachel
here, they depend on me, I think and it seems unkind to walk away from them.
Plus, of course, everyone here has been great. I know what it can be like
having a new face come in with new ideas but everyone�s been great.�

&nbsp;

�Brian excepted,�
Clegg chipped in. Elly gave him a look that I guessed
was intended to say �get over it.�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� I said, �Brian excepted.�

&nbsp;

The desert menu appeared. I�m not a fan but
Clegg rubbed his hands, summoning up a sticky toffee pudding. Elly raised an eyebrow but joined him by ordering a mango sorbet . �Do you want to hear my take on this,� she said.

&nbsp;

Clegg turned towards her. �Of course,� he
said. I nodded too.

&nbsp;

�Larry, you�re disposable.�

&nbsp;

�Well, thanks,� I said, �I know what that
means around here.�

&nbsp;

�No, don�t get me wrong. You�ve put the
business on a course. It�s quite capable of following it through. The sales
guys are taking an account managed approach now, research support that, the
Search &amp; Snatch service is up and running. You�ve done what Freddie brought
you in to do.�

&nbsp;

Clegg looked thoughtful as he weighed Elly�s point. His pudding appeared and provided a
distraction.

&nbsp;

Freddie went on. �Let me give you my view,
Larry. I�ve been pretty happy with what you�ve done. But Elly�s
right, the business probably doesn�t need someone with your talents now. We
could make do with someone less qualified. Probably not even �voluntary� if you
know what I mean. In some way�s I�d be happy to see you working for one of our
customers and I think you�ve earned the right to make the choice. The only
problem is that I had another idea. But if that�s what you want to do�..�

&nbsp;

I was intrigued. �Another
idea?� I asked.

&nbsp;

�Mmm,� said
Freddie. �Do you remember something you talked to me about a while back? You�d
hooked up with some girl after a practice run. What was her name?�

&nbsp;

�Kelly,� I said.

&nbsp;

�That working?� Freddie asked. I pulled a face. �Uh huh.
Oh, well. You said something about there might be an emerging opportunity for
�voluntary� slaves; ones we wouldn�t need to abduct.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, sure,� I said. My main recollection
was that Freddie hadn�t seemed very interested, I hadn�t raised it again until
my report of the trip to see Steve and then I imagined it had got forgotten in
all the business over Tricia being discovered in the container at Stansted.

&nbsp;

�Well, I did some thinking about it. There
was the feed back from Steve�s meeting and the things that are going on in
Kushtia with their cultural programme was interesting
too. I think it�s something we need to explore. It could be an opportunity, it
could be a threat. Hard to tell yet, I guess. Anyway I wanted to see if we
could explore it a bit but I don�t want to do it inside the business. Too many conflicts of interest. I want to set up something
at arm�s length. Close enough to keep an eye on it, separate enough for it not
to get disrupted by other interests. I thought you might like to run it.�

&nbsp;

�Run it?� I said. �Me?�

&nbsp;

�Why not? You have a good grasp of what makes sense and what doesn�t. You can
keep the numbers on track. You�d have some support on the financials but you�d
have day to day control. You�d report into FCE Group board of course.�

&nbsp;

�Well it sounds interesting,� I said.
�Starting from scratch?�

&nbsp;

�Not quite. We�ve identified a possible
business that we might bring in to the Group to provide us with a starting
position,� Elly dumped a folder labelled �Project
Willing� on the desk. �Small business set up by an entrepreneurial lawyer in
one of the university towns.�

&nbsp;

�Dreadful what some of these lawyers get up
to,� Clegg smirked at Elly. 

&nbsp;

She gave him a look of tolerant amusement.
I remembered that was her background too. �She�s got half a dozen girls under
contract, small network of clients, interesting approaches to recruitment and
promoting the service. I�ve done due diligence on the contracts, they�re pretty
solid and they�d allow the owner to novate them in
the event of change of ownership of the business.�

&nbsp;

�So we thought we might make a take over
play for them,� said Freddie.

&nbsp;

Something about the way he said it made me
think that his idea of a take over wasn�t quite what the normal practices of
corporate governance would encompass. �Freddie, does this �take over� involve the lady entrepreneur finding herself wrapped in
rope and enjoying Rick�s hospitality in the Prep Centre?�

&nbsp;

Freddie looked pained. Elly
grinned. �Larry, Larry,� Freddie said, �You know I like to have a controlling
interest in things.�

&nbsp;

�Don�t you think we should try a
conversation first? Just to see if she�s interested? She might need the
funding, might be grateful of some support.� I saw Elly
give Freddie an �I told you so� look.

&nbsp;

�Do I take it that means you�ll do this?�
Freddie said. �Rather than swanning
off to Kushtia?���� 

&nbsp;

I picked up the folder and thumbed through
it. I had to admit that the idea of running my own operation sounded appealing.
�I need Rachel and Sukie for support,� I said.

&nbsp;

�I think we might be able to do that,� said
Freddie. 

&nbsp;

�And we do it legitimately,� Freddie looked
uncomfortable, �at least until we�ve come to the conclusion there�s no
alternative.�

&nbsp;

�OK,� said Freddie reluctantly. I saw Elly grin.

&nbsp;

We had a deal.

Chapter 78 : Hail &amp; Farewell

&nbsp;

�I feel a bit of a fraud,� I said looking
out at the crowd of people that had turned up. �After all I�m not really
leaving. Well not to go far.�

&nbsp;

�No, I know,� said Freddie, �but it�s good
to have an excuse to get everyone together and let them have some fun. Look,
it�s your leaving party, enjoy it.� 

&nbsp;

We�d borrowed Brad�s castle for the event.
Brad was back in Kushtia full time now and Freddie had arranged to look after
the property for him in his absence. We�d brought stock down from the Prep
Centre to help out and most of the team were there. Even Elly
turned up, which I took as a great compliment. She just never came to events
like this.

&nbsp;

Brian�s family and some of the other stock
had been put down into the cells for the amusement of any that wanted to take
advantage of the opportunity. As usual it seemed like it was the accountants
and the HR people that were queuing up for a turn. Fair enough, I guess, they
don�t get many perks on their side of the business. Rick had put a few of the
guards down there to keep an eye on things but that was more about protecting
the girls than preventing any trouble..����


&nbsp;

I saw two faces that I recognised - Rebecca
&amp; Amanda had been acquired from Constanza (I
suspected mainly with the aim of giving Freddie some insights in Constanza�s operations and possibly getting some
intelligence about the business with Tricia) and had been pressed into waitressing duties. At least some of their flight attendant
skills were still being put to use. Close up I wasn�t too impressed with the
surgery that Constanza had put them through. Sure the
surgeon had got the slanted eyes all right and the breast reduction had meant
they could wear the cheong sam
with a measure of authenticity but the overall effect was a bit weird. They
just looked like an uncomfortable mixture of Asiatic and western features to me.
I wasn�t sure how Constanza could complain about the
barbarity of some owners and then do something like that. Still, they�d been
her property then, I suppose and they seemed happy enough as they wound their
way through the crowd carrying trays of drinks and snacks. Tricia could have
helped out too if she�d still been there, I guess.

&nbsp;

I caught myself thinking about the Rebecca,
Amanda and Tricia. They were all women that I�d shared a bed with at some time,
now hopelessly enslaved, physically abused, or mentally scarred. I supposed
that I ought to have felt some guilt about their situation, although Amanda was
the only one that I had been actually involved in kidnapping. Somehow it just
seemed part of the day to day job now. I counted up the number of women I�d
been involved in abducting.� I made it
47. It sounded like a lot but then I thought it had been almost a year. I stopped
again. It was a lot. However long it had been, it was a lot. 

&nbsp;

Sarah, on the other hand, was there. Harry
brought her into the room, leading her on a leash that linked to her collar.
She was smiling cheerfully as she stepped along behind him in impossibly high
heels and a skirt so tight that she seemed only to be able to move her legs
below the knees. Harry turned to talk to her. As he did so, I realised that
there must have been some reconciliation between the two of them that I had
missed out on while I was away in Barbados
and Kushtia. She had obviously finished her sexualisation and pleasure
programme and it looked like Harry was interested in the result.��� 

&nbsp;

Rachel and Sukie
were standing together at the side of the room. It looked to me as though they
were having fun too. I went across to talk to them. I�d told them that things
would be OK; that I�d carry on looking out for them in the new job. Rachel was
looking forward to helping. Sukie had just seemed
grateful she wasn�t going to be turned away or sold again. Now the two of them
looked happy. Sukie was sitting holding Rachel�s
hand. �It�s been a strange year,� I said. 

&nbsp;

Rachel turned to me, �It�s not a bad story.
Maybe you should write it down. I could help you.�

&nbsp;

I thought she was probably right.

&nbsp;

The only one that wasn�t there was Tricia.
At least, she wasn�t there in person. Laying on a
chair at the side of the room was a copy of the Daily Mirror. Its front page
was filled with a grainy photograph taken with a telephoto lens. A solitary
figure could be made out against a background of trees in some sort of garden
or park. In spite of the way that her head was hunched down, it looked like
Tricia to me. The caption said �Container Girl : No
Hope Of Identification Says Hospital�. I read the story below the photograph.
The paper�s reporters had tracked down the mental hospital where the girl found
in the Russian aircraft was being cared for. Sources on the medical team said
that there had been no progress in either getting the girl to identify herself
or discovering anything about her. Security services were still allegedly
interested in talking to members of the Russian foreign intelligence service. A
police source felt the girl was probably Russian,
their favoured explanation was that she was a dissident, asylum seeker that had
slipped into the UK somehow and was now being repatriated in a rather extreme way. The
Russians had declined to comment. I thought it was only a while before the
police put out a full face shot and someone recognised her. Freddie had said
that wouldn�t be a problem, like all of Harry�s team she didn�t have a link to
her past as far as the organisation was concerned. I wondered how they�d break
the links for me if they ever needed to.�


&nbsp;

I dropped the paper back on to the chair. Freddie
called everyone to order and was kind enough to say a few words. I ended up
feeling a bit embarrassed, I felt he made too much of the difference I�d made
but there was a warm round of applause at the end so I guess that the rest of
the team didn�t feel he had over egged it.

&nbsp;

Harry stood up to add his contribution.
That was even more embarrassing as he chose to recall some of the more amusing
episodes of my life with Clegg Enterprises. I�d have been happier if he hadn�t
bothered to remember Rachel and the keyboard, but she was good enough to smile
about it too. 

&nbsp;

I got to thank everyone. I didn�t say much
more than that. I always reckon these things go on too long.

&nbsp;

Finally Freddie got up and said, �As a last
word before you all go off and get stuck into the drink and the food, I�ve got one
more announcement to make. Larry�s moving on to pastures new, fortunately
within Clegg Enterprises but we want to carry on with his ideas and approach.
Larry�s been a great help in helping us to identity a suitable successor and
I�d like to introduce you to her now�.�

&nbsp;

On cue, two of Rick�s guards wrestled a
girl through the door into the middle of the room. She had a sack over her head
but from the familiar sound of grunting and mummphing
it was pretty obvious she was gagged. Beneath the sack, the captive woman was
obviously attractively built. Her blouse was torn a bit and so was her straight
skirt but she hadn�t been subdued by her experience, she was till trying to
kick out at the guards as they pulled the bag from her head.� As the bag came free it revealed
a mass of long ash blonde hair and a pair of grey eyes looking out furiously
from above the strips of grey tape that plastered the lower half of her face.
She shook her head and looked around in disbelief at the assembled crowd and
the round of applause that she received.�
As soon as she saw me she started struggling even more. I hadn�t seen
her for quite a while. We�d worked together about five years ago when I�d just
been starting out in marketing management and she was a trainee marketing exec.
We�d gone on to work for competitors. Some of the stuff she�d done had given us
a bit of trouble. She was good at what she did. It would be interesting to see
how she adapted to some new markets and new products.

&nbsp;

The way that they�d taped her arms with the
strips around her elbows and around her body under her tits emphasised her well
configured chest. The way she was struggling did nothing to prevent everyone
appreciating it. 

&nbsp;

Harry said to me, �Hey, she�s got a nice
body. Certainly a better shape than her predecessor.
She�s going to fit in well around here.� Sarah smiled at Harry�s enthusiasm. He
went on, �Only thing is Freddie didn�t give us a name. Who is our new
colleague?�

&nbsp;

�Oh, I said, that�s the best part of it.�

&nbsp;

He looked blank.

&nbsp;

�Well, it couldn�t be anything else,
really. Harry, meet, Sally.�

&nbsp;

Even Rick gave me a pained look as the
guards hustled the confused and squealing girl away. Harry grunted and led
Sarah off in search of a drink. Sukie, Rachel and I
did the same thing. There would be plenty of work soon enough but for the
evening at least we thought we�d enjoy ourselves. And then there�d always be
some market research to do with Kelly.

&nbsp;

It hadn�t been a bad year. For me at any rate.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; THE END
