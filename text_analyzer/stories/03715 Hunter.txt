Synopsis: Hunting for a hot adventure? Are you the Hunter or the pray? How far are you willing to go?Hot night. Loud music. Sea of movement. 

  I am on the prowl!&nbsp;I'm in need, and the hunt has begun.&nbsp;Holding my
  drink, I let current of bodies carry me slowly around the dance floor.&nbsp;The
  air is thick with energy and body heat.&nbsp;One can easily get lost in sensory
  overload; bass drumming deep in the stomach, a kaleidoscope of lights almost
  palpable on the exposed skin.&nbsp;Momentarily lightning-like flashes replaced
  by minute darkness � ~ where do all these hands go at those times? ~ 

  Couples moving in unison, making dance look like love, girls huddled in little
  giggling groups, women focusing on someone, men looking � 

  When you hunt you observe, find the pray, single it out, mark it and than move
  in.&nbsp;

  Many possible targets.&nbsp;Short white blond hair, tall, leaning against the
  bar, looking at me.&nbsp;Our eyes meet.&nbsp;He smiles.&nbsp;I appraise. ~
  Next! ~ 

  Moving on the dance floor, slower than the beat dictates yet pleasant, not
  in disharmony, just � on his own terms.&nbsp;Light sheen of sweat covering
  a tanned chest. Nice. I smile at him appreciating the display.&nbsp;~ Good
  boy, keep it up! Next! ~ &nbsp;

  I moved too close to the dance floor and an attractive male couple moves towards
  me, inviting me to join them.&nbsp;They move with the practiced ease of lovers,
  two halves, brothers in arms � tempting offer.&nbsp;I smile and let them pull
  me between them, allowing the music to move my body, reflecting theirs, an
  occasional touch, a brush against hot skin. They encircle me raising invisible
  barriers around us, creating our own space on the crowded podium.&nbsp;Tempting,
  but, too easy � time to move on.&nbsp;I peck each on the cheek with a warm
  thank you, and extract myself from their embrace, leaving them calling after
  me, smiling. ~ Next! ~ 

  Floating with the crowd, I work my way towards a darker corner, a good, quiet
  place.&nbsp;Taking in the whole club, the MTV generation, the assault on all
  the senses seems more obvious from here.&nbsp;It is almost surreal, like watching
  a movie, a video, not being part of it.&nbsp;

  My eyes are drawn to a spot.&nbsp;Darkness moving in the dark.&nbsp;What am
  I looking at?&nbsp;Flash of the white light, followed by thunder.&nbsp;Total
  blackout.&nbsp;Dizzying pulsing white light makes everything look like a broken
  movie replay.&nbsp;Usually, I wait this part out, with my eyes shut, but this
  time is different.&nbsp;This time I need to see!&nbsp;A flash of obsidian skin,
  tautly stretched over a wide chest.&nbsp;A glimpse of toned stomach.&nbsp;Hips
  encased in black leather.&nbsp;Black eyes focused on me. 

  Blackout.&nbsp;I have been holding my breath all this time I realize, feeling
  light-headed&nbsp;� ~ must be from all that pulsing light ~ . The
  music returns carrying the softer lights with it.&nbsp;My eyes did not move
  from the spot, and he is still there.&nbsp;Leaning against the ledge of the
  wall, his arms spread out on his sides, a black short sleeved shirt doing nothing
  to conceal, but rather framing his smooth body.&nbsp;He is not moving. He is
  on display, allowing me to appraise him. Our eyes meet again and I know he
  knows I like what I see.&nbsp;I know he can sense my pulse quickening. My mouth
  is dry and my legs are rubbery. And I know he knows. 

  We are not smiling.&nbsp;We are not moving.&nbsp;He is willing me to come to
  him.&nbsp;I am waiting for him to come to me.&nbsp;Two hunters caught in no-mans
  land.&nbsp;The song changes and I start swaying with the rhythm, bringing my
  drink to my desert dry lips.&nbsp;The ice rushes into my mouth and I play with
  it on my tongue.&nbsp;The crowd melts into background and there seems to be
  no one between us.&nbsp;His stomach moving slowly with his breath, his dark
  eyes still fixed on me.&nbsp;

  I want him!&nbsp;I can go to him, but that's just not me!&nbsp;I can walk out
  and � miss on this opportunity. But� that's not me either!&nbsp;Will he meet
  me half way?&nbsp;I break the eye contact and lover my head allowing my hair
  to fall and form curtain in front of my face.&nbsp;I turn slowly and leave
  my empty glass on the table behind me. Moving with the music, my eyes half
  closed I make my way towards the dance floor.&nbsp;Music speeds up with primal
  drums shaking my insides.&nbsp;It feels good to move.&nbsp;I concentrate on
  the drum beat and tune everything else out.&nbsp;People are cutting into my
  space.&nbsp;The movement of my hand, the dismissive gesture, a mental push
  - that's all it takes to be left alone.&nbsp;

  Where is he?&nbsp;Sliding hands over my silk clad body, I wiggle like a snake
  shedding skin.&nbsp;The urge and heat is rising � where is  he?&nbsp;I
  glance towards the empty spot, scanning around almost in panic! Where?!&nbsp;Frozen
  for a moment in mid movement, my hands entwined above my head, place closing
  in on me, focus lost � 

  I feel rush of energy crawling on my back, thick darkness enters my field of
  vision, enclosing on my wrists, pulling them down and behind, pulling me backwards
  until my naked back meets hot silky skin.&nbsp;Every muscle in my body clenches
  and than relaxes, releasing, giving way, accepting guidance. I follow his movements,
  cradled in his arms, my eyes closed I am open to him, feeling, learning� 

  He moves us both, my arse in his lap, our hips gyrating, sliding against each
  other. Leaving my hands behind my back, wedged between us, he slides his right
  hand around my waist, while moving my hair out of his way with the other one.&nbsp;The
  tips of his fingers brush my cheek and I turn my face towards them, to find
  his eyes right next to me, his lips lingering above my shoulder.&nbsp;His gaze
  burns my lips, naked throat, bringing blush to my exposed cleavage.&nbsp;He
  closes his eyes and moves to my neck, inhaling my scent, brushing skin with
  his teeth, tasting me with the electrifying touch of his tongue.&nbsp;His big,
  wide shoulders wrap around me like armour, melting me into his body, making
  me part of him.&nbsp;He withdraws like a shadow, spinning me around, catching
  me, making me straddle his knee, cold leather between my hot damp tights. 

  We are still dancing, maybe, or is this foreplay?&nbsp;I can not say.&nbsp;I
  am not the hunter, today I am the prey. Caught in his gaze like a rabbit caught
  in high beams, incapable of escape, unwilling to retrieve. As the music changes
  into something offensive, he peels me off his body and helps me stand on my
  own.&nbsp;He extends his hand and I take it knowing I am his now.&nbsp;We leave
  the dance floor and the crowd parts for him on our way out. 

  Salty sea air washes over us as the door closes muting the music we left behind.&nbsp;Not
  looking at me, he leads the way towards the beach.&nbsp;My feet sink into the
  sand and I pause to take off my heels.&nbsp;He waits, intently watching my
  every move.&nbsp;I pick up my shoes and step closer to him, only to see him
  turn away and proceed towards the beach.&nbsp;Still holding his hand I fall
  slightly behind watching him move like a big black cat.&nbsp;A warm night breeze
  pulls on his shirt making it balloon behind him, giving me glance of his tight
  buttocks.&nbsp;

  We reach water line, sand feeling damp under my feet.&nbsp;The light of the
  moon is reflecting on mirror-like water and two dark pools on his face.&nbsp;He
  lets go of my hand and stands motionless in front of me, waiting.&nbsp;

  My turn �&nbsp;Good. 

  I drop my shoes and they land with soft thump in the sand.&nbsp;I look at him,
  his dark pupils swimming in the clear white of his eyes, his clean, sharp face
  lines, amazingly full dark lips, long hair spilling over his shoulders, muscles
  twitching as if pulled on by my gaze.&nbsp;His breathing is slow and relaxed.&nbsp;I
  look in his eyes, expectant.&nbsp;I turn sideways to him and start walking
  around him, drinking in the sight. He is not moving.&nbsp;His back is perfect
  muscle disappearing in snug pants. I put my hand on his hip and drag it over
  his butt, feeling it clench under my touch. 

  I make a full circle and stand in front of him, looking up to meet his eyes.&nbsp;Slowly
  I place both my hands on his chest and slide them over rock hard muscles, over
  his rippled shoulders pulling his shirt off, letting it slide to the ground.
  I lean into him and deeply inhale his masculine scent. My lips connect with
  his silk-like skin and I lick him, cherishing that first taste.&nbsp;I let
  my hands roam over his shoulders, pulling him into a feverish embrace, running
  my nails gently down his back.&nbsp;

  He reaches up and grabs a handful of my hair pulling my head back, while his
  other hand grabs my arse to prevent me from falling. He meets my lips slowly,
  tentatively, exploring, breathing my breath, smelling me, looking at me. He
  kisses me, possessively, taking rather than giving, grinding against me, almost
  bruising, taking my breath away, making me lose myself in his hot mouth, his
  strong embrace.&nbsp;He breaks the kiss, and his hands grab the dress and pull
  it over my head, leaving me shivering almost naked, gasping for air, my arousal
  obvious from rock hard nipples to soaking wet crotch. 

  He pulls me, once again, into the kiss, one hand in my hair, the other crushing
  my breast.&nbsp;My knees give out and he eases me on my knees in front of him.&nbsp;As
  my eyes regain focus, I am holding onto his hips for balance and staring at
  a bulging hump stretching his pants, wanting to be released.&nbsp;His hand
  tightens in my hair and he forces my face against the lump, rubbing me gently
  alongside his painful erection.&nbsp;The pungent aroma fills my nose as I slide
  up and down, unquestioning, my tongue laps out and I lick the imprisoned hardness
  tasting the leather. 

  He yanks on my hair, forcing me to look up at his face.&nbsp;

  His voice barely audible: �Take if off!�&nbsp;Clearly a command. 
&nbsp; 
Without looking away, I move my hands and undo his belt and fly, releasing
  his fully erect cock.&nbsp;It comes out with almost a pop, scarcely missing
  my face, standing in its full black glory just inches to the right.&nbsp;I
  tug on his pants lowering them to his ankles, and trace back with my hands
  sliding over muscular legs, up, all the way back to where I started, to his
  narrow hips. 

  He rubs himself over my cheek, heat radiating from the living stone. So smooth,
  so soft yet unyieldingly hard, crisscrossed with thick veins, pulsing with
  life.&nbsp;He brings it to my mouth and I open slowly, licking my lips, flickering
  over his twitching head, but he pushes hard, impatiently and I push back with
  my hands on his hips, stopping him. A tug on my hair pulls my head back, again,
  eliciting a surprised gasp from me. 

�Who is in charge?� his voice hits me like a slap.&nbsp;

  Hesitation.&nbsp;I swallow: �You.� My response but a whisper. 

� Who  is in charge!� his hand crushes my hair, pulling on my scalp. 

�You! You are in charge!� I pant. 

�Sir.� he growls. 

�You are in charge, Sir� I hear myself saying. 

  Danger! Crawling on the edge here! Red light flashing in my head. My cunt on
  fire. He is the one! He is the wild, dangerous animal I was hunting for, and
  now he has his claws on me, in me. And I'm loving it! 

  His grip relaxes, a little, as he guides me in to the position. 

�Open.� His eyes cold, his lips, oh! So hot! 

  He enters my mouth and allows me to bathe him in my saliva.&nbsp;He smells
  clean and of leather.&nbsp;He tastes salty, like the sea.&nbsp;My mouth's full
  of him, so tasty, so smooth, so tender, so hard � He moves his hips like a
  lazy wave, flooding my mouth and withdrawing, working my spit all over him,
  farther and thicker on his shaft with every push.&nbsp;

  My hands, feather touch on his contracting muscles, sliding from hips to his
  tight, round arse with his every thrust. I'm his tonight, for better or for
  worse and I beg those cruel charcoal eyes to do me right.&nbsp;He moves slower
  but deeper, and I tilt my head even further back, opening my throat for him.
  Every push makes me gag; every gag is battle of my will over my body. He enters
  slowly and I try to swallow, convulsing around him, tears in my eyes. Smile
  in his. 

  He holds me; my throat stretched to maximum, his big hard cock deep in me,
  my stomach retching, choking, tears sliding from the corners of my eyes as
  I tenderly caress his clutched buttocks.&nbsp;I need air, I need to push him,
  I can't push him, I must not withdraw.&nbsp;My hands stop moving and my grasp
  on his hips increases as I'm fighting the need to survive.&nbsp;

  He waits, looking at me, enjoying my struggle.&nbsp;He pulls out, watching
  me convulse, fighting to breathe, fighting the urge to be sick.&nbsp;He gives
  me time to calm down, to be able to look back into his eyes, and than he enters
  me again, slowly, deeply, until my nose is grinding against his pelvis. 

�Stick your tongue out and lick my balls.� 

  I can't believe him. I can't believe myself! With my throat convulsing around
  his thick shaft I stick my tongue out and probe the silken skin of his sack.
  He slowly withdraws and I breathe, thick dribble coating my chin, sliding on
  my chest.&nbsp;I move my hands to caress his taut stomach, and he moves, forcing
  me to swallow him yet again.&nbsp;I close my eyes and welcome the painful thickness
  stretching my throat.&nbsp;I swallow and hear him draw in the air, music to
  my ears. 

  He withdraws leaving my throat raw.&nbsp;His cock glistens at the moonlight
  twitching in front of my face.&nbsp;He is looking at me with a smile. 

�Well done.� Praise. 

�Thank you, Sir� my voice hoarse, my breathing hard.&nbsp;I'm kneeling at his
feet, my legs spread obscenely wide, my cunt cold from the cooled down moisture
soaked into my silk panties.&nbsp;All of a sudden it hits me: what a sight we
are! Ebony God and his ivory worshipper. 
&nbsp; 
�Give me your panties.�&nbsp;He requests with his hand outstretched. Not daring
  to get up, awkwardly, I squirm out of my soaked underwear and hand it to him.&nbsp;He
  looks at it, feeling its dampness, brings it to his face and inhales deeply.
  My heart skips a beat as he reaches towards me and wipes the drool off my face
  with the cloth saturated in my own scent. 

�Lay down on your back and play with your self for me!� 

  The heat rushes into my cheeks, I don't do that!&nbsp;That is so private to
  me, that is mine, I can't do that in front of anyone. He is standing, in front
  of me, burning me with his stare, waiting. Gods! I move slowly, unfolding my
  legs from underneath me, the sand cold on my skin, lowering myself to elbows,
  legs clenched together, my stomach in a knot. 

  I look down, my heaving breasts topped with painfully hard nipples, softly
  moving with my breath, stomach seamlessly curbing into the denuded mound, hidden
  between tightly clenched thighs.&nbsp;My legs stretch forever, and than abruptly
  the bluish milky white of my flesh meets obsidian black of carved stone.&nbsp;He
  forces his foot between my legs, and steps in, making me open for him.&nbsp;I
  clench my teeth and close my eyes, relaxing my hips, my head touches the sand,
  red hair spilling around me like bloody halo. 

  Reluctantly my hands reach to caress my breast, fine sand feeling rough on
  my skin. I try not to think where I am.&nbsp;I can feel his legs between mine
  and I spread wider to avoid contact. He is quiet and still, as I slide my hands
  over my body, following familiar paths. My hand descends between my legs, finding
  my slippery folds. The rings in my pussy lips chime while I play with my clit.
  My fingers soaked in my juices, slip and slide, coaxing the engorging nub out
  to the moonlight. 

  My heart races, my breathing becoming sporadic, I hold my breath until it hurts,
  I'm climbing the steep approach towards climax, so needed, so wanted� 

�Look at me!� His voice brings me back from the verge; my eyes fly open, frustration
making itself known in my hissing exhale. 

�You are doing this for Me. So, look at me.� Yes! Looking at him, waves of hot
and cold flushes dance over my skin. Black beast, the living statue cut out of
stone, slowly moving, rocking hips, caressing himself with my silken underwear,
black eyes burning with intensity, his breath coming in short saps.&nbsp;His
breathing stops.&nbsp;He throws his head back and showers me with his milk. All
over me, splatter hitting my tits, my stomach, my legs � He is breathing hard.
His hand clutched on his still hard cock.&nbsp;He smiles. 

�You are a bloody mess! Go wash yourself!� 

  I twitch, but move and start rising, attempting to maintain a semblance of
  grace when his voice cuts me: �Did I say you can stand? Crawl.� 

  I freeze, crouching.&nbsp;~ why am I doing this? ~&nbsp;I lower myself
  to hands and knees, moving slowly towards the sea.&nbsp;My tits swaying underneath
  me, nipples dragging in the sand, my ass in the air, my wet slit adorned with
  gleaming rings, pouting at him.&nbsp;I reach the water and stop to rinse the
  offending evidence of his release. 

�Don't stop, get in deeper. Keep going.� He is right behind me, and I continue
to crawl, entering the warm water, my hands sinking in the sand, my breasts making
splashing sounds� 

  He grabs my cunt rings, successfully stopping me, I gasp.&nbsp;My head is just
  above the water, my pussy just out of it.&nbsp;He fingers my rings for few
  moments, making funny noise, making me shiver.&nbsp;Than, he kneels behind
  me, forcing my legs apart, and enters my pussy in one smooth motion&nbsp;~
  He never went soft! ~ I can not believe it, yet there he is, big and hard,
  filling me, stretching me, eliciting small grunts and squeaks from deep within
  me.&nbsp;With every push he hits my cervix, and I still do not feel the slap
  of his balls. I try to move away from him, to slip slightly forward when he
  thrusts, but his hold on my hips is strong and he pulls me back, not allowing
  me to retreat. 

  I feel him bending forward, gathering my hair, wrapping his hand into it, right
  at the nape of my neck. He withdraws leaving me empty.&nbsp;I feel him push
  against my anus. 

�No!� I gasp, not able to move, not able to look at him. 

�Quiet!� he growls.&nbsp;�You are mine tonight, and you are going to please me!
Quiet!� 
  He pushes and I try to escape, but his hold on my hair, water just under my
  chin, I can't move.&nbsp;I feel him sliding in and the pain shoots from my
  bottom.&nbsp;I take deep breath and start to scream, when he pushes my head
  under the water.&nbsp;I hold my breath.&nbsp;Fear! I move my hands up, to grab
  on his arm, but that causes me to lose balance and push myself harder on his
  shaft.&nbsp;My hands find the sand and I try to push myself up, but I only
  succeed in pushing my self fully on the intruder in my bowels. Our tights connect
  and he yanks my head out of water. 

  I exhale, coughing and gulping the air. He holds me still for a while, giving
  me time to recover, to take a deep breath. I start to talk and he pushes me
  under the water again. This time he starts pumping my ass, while I frantically
  struggle to get out.&nbsp;Panic! 

  Burning in my lungs, lack of air making me dizzy, a pull on my hair and I am
  out. Breathe! Air! He continues fucking my ass, effortlessly, as if I'm a rag
  doll.&nbsp;My lungs fill with air and I hold my breath.&nbsp;He pushes me down.&nbsp;I
  don't fight.&nbsp;He feels good in my ass.&nbsp;Rocking me, sliding in and
  out, stretching me, filling me up.&nbsp;My pussy starts pulsing, clenching
  on empty � 

  He pulls me out. I breathe.&nbsp;I take deep breath, hold. Under the water.
  No breathing. Concentrate on the sensation in my ass, in my crotch, in my clit!
  His hand on my clit. Gently, right at the root, just like I do it!&nbsp;He
  is fucking my ass, he is controlling my breathing and he is wanking me off!
  I climb towards the climax fast.&nbsp;No breathing, just feel between my legs!&nbsp;He
  pulls me out. Exhale. Inhale. He lowers me down.&nbsp;Water embraces me. Whooshing
  sound of our repeated encounter, thump of my heart. Building fire in my clit.
  ~ Push on it just a little harder! ~ Almost there! 

  I impale myself on him and freeze as the orgasm hits me. The current running
  through my body, firing every nerve.&nbsp;I'm sitting in his lap, in his tender
  embrace. Safe. His breath on my ear, warm, comforting. 

�Breathe! Easy �&nbsp;You OK?�&nbsp;he is concerned.&nbsp;I start shaking violently
and he hugs me closer, wrapping himself around me. 

�I'm cold.� My teeth chattering. ~This is funny! ~ I start laughing. 

�Hang in there. I'll take care of you.� He whispers as he scoops me in his arms
and carries me to the beach house.&nbsp;~ we will get the clothes later�~  I
wrap my hands around his neck and shiver.
