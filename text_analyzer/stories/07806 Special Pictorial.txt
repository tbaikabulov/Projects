 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol stood at the table, looking at the letter.&nbsp; She had just received her notification.&nbsp; She was 35 and was scheduled to be executed on her 36th birthday in four weeks.&nbsp; Carol didn't know what to do.&nbsp; Her husband was dead and there was no one else to take care of the three youngest children: Michelle, Kelly, and Melissa.&nbsp; Jessica, at age 17, and Kimberly, at age 18, should be fine, but they were still not ready to take care of their siblings.&nbsp; Michelle was 5 years old, Kelly was 7 years old, and Melissa was 8 years old.&nbsp; There had to be a way out of this mess.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The phone rang.&nbsp; Carol was in no mood to talk to anyone but she knew she should still answer the phone.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hello," Carol said as she picked up the phone.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hi, Carol," the voice on the other end of the line said.&nbsp; "This is Charlie.&nbsp; I do not know if you remember me, but I was in charge of the video shoot at the mother-daughter barbecue last month."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh, hi, Charlie," Carol replied.&nbsp; "I do remember you.&nbsp; You had on the lovely blue outfit with the white ruffles, right?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes," Charlie said, relieved that Carol remembered her.&nbsp; That would make this easier.&nbsp; "Well, we are doing another mother-daughter barbecue this month and everyone seemed to like you and Kimberly so I am calling to invite you two back."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm so...sorry, Charlie," Carol said as she began to cry, "but now i..is not a g..good time."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hey," Charlie said sympathetically, "are you okay, Carol?&nbsp; You sound distraught.&nbsp; I know that talking over the phone is not great, so if you want to talk about it, I can come over if you like."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol thought back to the barbecue.&nbsp; Everyone was rushed due to the late notification, but Charlie, the coordinator, was a beacon of calm in a sea of madness.&nbsp; Charlie had been so kind and understanding.&nbsp; Maybe talking to Charlie would make her feel better.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That sounds good, Charlie," Carol said.&nbsp; "I would really appreciate it if you could come over."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Sure thing, sweetie.&nbsp; You still live on Madison?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes," Carol replied. "2374 Madison."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Ok.&nbsp; I will be there in about 20 minutes."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Thanks, Charlie.&nbsp; I really appreciate it."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After Carol hung up, she rushed upstairs to take a shower.&nbsp; She had been crying all morning and she knew she looked like a horror movie victim.&nbsp; Twenty minutes and one shower later, Carol came downstairs, a towel wrapped around her head as she heard a knock on the door.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hi, Charlie," Carol said as she opened the door.&nbsp; "Thanks for coming over."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Not a problem, sweetie.&nbsp; I am always ready to help out a friend, even if all I can do is listen."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well," Carol said dejectedly, "that may be all you can do in this situation.&nbsp; I have coffee in the kitchen, would you like a cup?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I would love a cup.&nbsp; It is still only 10:00am so I shouldn't have to worry."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Coffee give you problems?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Only after noon," Charlie said with a chuckle.&nbsp; "If I drink any coffee after noon, I do not sleep well at night."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The two women went into the kitchen.&nbsp; Charlie sat down as Carol went to make a fresh pot for the two of them.&nbsp; Charlie could not help but notice the letter on the table.&nbsp; She had seen plenty of them before and now she understood Carol's behavior.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Looking around the kitchen, Charlie saw pictures of Carol's daughters.&nbsp; Five daughters, three still very young.&nbsp; Getting notified that you were going to be executed while you had three helpless girls at home was enough to rattle any woman.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Seeing the pictures of Kimberly and another daughter close to Kimberly's age, Charlie had an idea.&nbsp; It was not a pretty idea, but it might be worth it to Carol to consider it in this situation.&nbsp; As Carol returned to the table with the two cups of coffee, Charlie decided to let Carol bring up the letter.&nbsp; Better to go slow with this.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"So, Carol," Charlie said as she took a sip of her coffee, "what is the problem?&nbsp; I have known you for a while and you have never sounded as disturbed as you were earlier."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"This is the problem," Carol said as she waved at the letter on the table.&nbsp; "I have been notified that I am to report to the processing center in four weeks.&nbsp; I will be executed and then processed as meat."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"We all go through this, dear," Charlie said sympathetically.&nbsp; "I am sorry.&nbsp; Is there anything I can do to help?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I don't know, Charlie.&nbsp; I just don't know.&nbsp; Neither Kimberly, nor Jessica are mature enough to take care of their little sisters.&nbsp; They could probably do it if they worked together, but they never would.&nbsp; They don't hate each other, but they rarely see eye-to-eye on anything.&nbsp; I just keep thinking there has to be a way out of this."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hmmm," Charlie said thoughtfully.&nbsp; She had to be careful.&nbsp; She knew a possible way out, but it meant a sacrifice that Carol may not be willing to make.&nbsp; "I think I know of a way, but.....no.&nbsp; It is not something I could recommend."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What?&nbsp; What is it?&nbsp; I may not be able to do it, but I would like to hear any suggestions you can offer."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, you know I film the mother-daughter barbecues, right?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes," Carol said.&nbsp; "Kimberly loved it when we went to the one last month.&nbsp; She had so much fun.&nbsp; She loves teasing people who underestimate her."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"She like the look on people's faces when they realize she is 18 years old."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What?&nbsp; Wait a minute.&nbsp; She's 18?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes.&nbsp; Her birthday was ten months ago."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No way!&nbsp; I thought she was 14 or so."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"She would love to hear that," Carol said with a slight smile.&nbsp; She was right.&nbsp; Talking with Charlie was helping her to feel better.&nbsp; "She is so small and her breasts are almost non-existent.&nbsp; Most people take her for a 13-year-old or 14-year-old."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Damn," Charlie said.&nbsp; "That is what I thought.&nbsp; A lot of our viewers of the barbecue video thought so too.&nbsp; They really liked her."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"She was a bit nervous when I told her that clothing was forbidden at the barbecue, but after meeting that girl, Miranda, she loosened up."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I see," Charlie said.&nbsp; "Anyway, you know I film these barbecues.&nbsp; Well, I also film a show a friend of mine is producing.&nbsp; It is a contest of sorts.&nbsp; The contestants are mothers like you who are scheduled for execution.&nbsp; There are two rounds and the winner of the two rounds gets released from her execution."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Released?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I mean that their execution orders are nullified," Charlie explained.&nbsp; "The winner is removed from the snuffee lottery and the execution database.&nbsp; If you win, you will never be notified that you have to be snuffed.&nbsp; If you choose to volunteer, though, then that is up to you."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kimberly woke from a pleasant dream.&nbsp; It was about that barbecue she and her mother attended a month ago.&nbsp; That girl, Miranda, sure was fun.&nbsp; Kimberly had interested in playing, but Miranda, thinking Kimberly was 13 or so, was hesitant.&nbsp; It wasn't until Carol had explained to Miranda that, yes, Kimberly was really 18 years old, that Miranda relented.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kimberly thought that being small made teasing people very easy, but it had some serious drawbacks.&nbsp; For one thing, Jessica, had passed her in size when Jessica was nine years old.&nbsp; Kimberly was never going to catch up, either.&nbsp; She realized that whenever she saw her younger sister that was a full foot taller.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Things always seemed to happen to Jessica first.&nbsp; Jessica got boobs first.&nbsp; Jessica got her period first.&nbsp; Actually, Kimberly didn't mind that one.&nbsp; But Jessica was allowed to drive and Kimberly was not.&nbsp; The DMV thought she was too short to be able to see over the steering effectively.&nbsp; Although Kimberly had to grudgingly admit that was true, she still thought it was unfair.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Deciding she had wallowed in misery long enough, Kimberly got up and got dressed.&nbsp; It was almost 10:30 and she was going to meet Emily and Theresa at the mall at noon.&nbsp; That gave Kimberly just enough time to get something to eat and catch the bus to the mall if her mom couldn't give her a ride.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Walking downstairs, Kimberly heard voices in the kitchen.&nbsp; As she prepared to walk into the kitchen, she caught the words 'execution orders'.&nbsp; That gave her pause.&nbsp; Knowing what that meant, she hid behind the wall in order to hear more.&nbsp; Maybe now would not be a good time to ask her mom for a ride.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"This contest sounds good so far," Carol said.&nbsp; "What's the catch?&nbsp; If you said you could not recommend it, the catch has to be a big one."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It's a snuff contest," Charlie mumbled unintelligibly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What?&nbsp; I didn't hear you."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It is a snuff contest," Charlie said with a sigh.&nbsp; "The mothers snuff their daughters and if they impress the panel of judges with the performance, they move on to round two.&nbsp; Then they do the same thing and if they beat the performance of the other finalist, they win."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I would have to kill my daughter?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Two of them, really.&nbsp; And given the ages of your children, it would have to be Kimberly and Jessica.&nbsp; No one would want to see you kill a little girl.&nbsp; Now do you see why I couldn't recommend it?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Why would anyone do that?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Because," Charlie said, "the winner would be allowed to live and do whatever they wanted.&nbsp; In your case, it would allow you to raise the little ones.&nbsp; You wouldn't have to worry if Kimberly and Jessica could manage it without you."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That's insane."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You asked if I had any ideas.&nbsp; I did.&nbsp; But as I said, I cannot recommend it."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And what would happen if I got to the second round and did not win?&nbsp; I would have killed Kimberly and Jessica and would still be executed on my 36th birthday.&nbsp; There would still be no one to take care of Michelle, Kelly, and Melissa."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Normally," Charlie said, "that would be true.&nbsp; On the other hand, I know of a good couple who, despite being unable to have children of their own, still want them.&nbsp; If you made it to the second round and lost, then the money received from the auction of your daughters' bodies would go to the couple and they would raise your remaining daughters."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And who is this couple?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"My husband and me.&nbsp; I am barren.&nbsp; I cannot have children. I will promise you this, though.&nbsp; If you attempt this and fail, I will raise Michelle, Kelly, and Melissa for you.&nbsp; But I cannot pressure you.&nbsp; This decision is yours alone."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kimberly jumped when a hand touched her shoulder.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What's up 'little' sister?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Damn you, Jessica," Kimberly whispered as she smiled.&nbsp; Jessica was the only one who could get away with calling her 'little'.&nbsp; For some reason, Kimberly sensed there was no malice behind it and it didn't hurt.&nbsp; "You almost gave me a heart attack."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Sorry, sorry," Jessica said to her older sister in a placating manner.&nbsp; "What's going on in there?&nbsp; It is not like you to eavesdrop on someone."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Mommy got her execution orders this morning."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Damn," Jessica said.&nbsp; "And who is that other woman?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That is Charlie, the woman that filmed the barbecue mommy and I went to last month.&nbsp; She was telling mom about a possible way out of her execution."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Really?&nbsp; How could she do that?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"There is a contest where, if mom wins, her orders are cancelled permanently.&nbsp; If she wins, she could live until she dies of old age."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Cool.&nbsp; Then, she should do it."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Ahhh," Kimberly said.&nbsp; "But there is a catch.&nbsp; It is a snuff contest.&nbsp; Mommy would have to kill two of her daughters; you and me.&nbsp; If she gets the highest rating in the first round, then she goes on to the second round.&nbsp; If she wins the second round, she is free."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Why would she risk this?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Because if she is executed, then it falls to you and me to raise our younger sisters."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I see," Jessica said.&nbsp; "And we have no skills.&nbsp; We would suck as parents.&nbsp; Now I understand."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"By the way, what are you doing home?&nbsp; Didn't you have mid-terms today?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yep, but I finished early and they let me go home.&nbsp; Same with you?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Nope," Kimberly said.&nbsp; "I had no tests today.&nbsp; I finished mine yesterday.&nbsp; Now shush, I want to hear this."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charlie and Carol sat in silence for a few minutes.&nbsp; Charlie knew what was going through the older woman's head.&nbsp; It was a chance to take care of her three youngest daughters.&nbsp; not a great chance, but a chance.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Getting up from the table, Carol refilled the coffee mugs and sat back down.&nbsp; Could she just kill her two oldest daughters?&nbsp; Could she?&nbsp; And Charlie was wrong.&nbsp; It was not Carol's decision alone.&nbsp; Kimberly and Jessica would have to know about it.&nbsp; Carol would easily overpower Kimberly, but Jessica was another story.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I don't know, Charlie," Carol said.&nbsp; "I would have to talk this over with Kimberly and Jessica.&nbsp; I understand what you said, but I could not do this if they did not agree to it."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kimberly looked up at her younger sister.&nbsp; Jessica understood that her mother was having a hard time with this, but it really was the best option for the little girls.&nbsp; Looking down at Kimberly, Jessica saw her older sister smile and nod.&nbsp; Jessica agreed.&nbsp; They had to do this.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Then, let's do it," Jessica said as she and Kimberly walked into the kitchen.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Wh-wh-what?&nbsp; What are you two doing home," Carol asked, horrified that they had heard the conversation.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I had no mid-term tests today and Jessica finished up early," Kimberly said.&nbsp; "We have heard enough of this contest to know that it is likely the best chance of getting Melissa, Michelle, and Kelly into a good home.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And what happens if I fail to get past the first round?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well," Kimberly said with a smile, "you will do me first.&nbsp; If we fail on the first round, then there will be no need to kill Jessica.&nbsp; She is big enough that she probably could manage if she had a little help.&nbsp; She could probably get one of our neighbors to watch the girls while she is at work."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charlie looked at the girls.&nbsp; Despite knowing the truth, she was still having a hard time seeing Kimberly as an adult.&nbsp; The girl was around four feet tall and couldn't have weighed more than 80 pounds soaking wet.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jessica, on the hand, was around 5'6" tall and probably weighed about 115 pounds.&nbsp; Carol was right.&nbsp; If Jessica decided to fight, thing could get very difficult.&nbsp; Things would go much better if the girls agreed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol was having a hard time understanding this.&nbsp; Her two eldest daughters had just volunteered to be killed by their own mother?&nbsp; She was stunned.&nbsp; She would never have thought the two would ever agree on anything, much less something this serious.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"A-a-are you sure," Carol asked her daughters.&nbsp; "I-I-I mean if we agree to this, this is permanent.&nbsp; I will k-k-kill you."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I understand, mommy," Kimberly said lovingly.&nbsp; "I do.&nbsp; And Jessica understands as well.&nbsp; But if we die and you win, then you will be able to take care of Kelly, Melissa, and Michelle.&nbsp; That sounds worth it to me."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And me too," Jessica added.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Wow," Charlie said.&nbsp; "You girls are something else.&nbsp; Let me up the ante a bit if I may.&nbsp; Jessica, Kimberly said that if your mom lost in the first round, you could, with help, raise the little girls. Is that right?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes," Jessica said.&nbsp; "If the girls had a baby sitter I could trust, I could finish school and get a job.&nbsp; I would need a little help learning to cook, but I think I could manage."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Then this is what I propose.&nbsp; Should you fail in the first round, Carol, I will help out as the babysitter for the little girls.&nbsp; I will also teach Jessica how to cook."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Okay," Carol said as she looked from Kimberly, to Jessica, to Charlie.&nbsp; "I guess we will do this.&nbsp; When do we have to do it?&nbsp; The first round, I mean?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, considering the time limitations the contest is already underway, we will be able to add you as a contestant, but you would have to do it this Saturday."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But that is only two days away," Carol objected.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It's okay, mommy," Kimberly said.&nbsp; "I am ready."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I am sorry," Charlie said.&nbsp; "But it will have to be that soon.&nbsp; It will take two days to tally the scores and I will let you know on Monday if you will proceed to round two.&nbsp; If you do, then you will have to kill Jessica next Saturday."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"A-a-are you really sure, honey," Carol asked Kimberly. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, mommy.&nbsp; I am really sure."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh," exclaimed Charlie.&nbsp; "I almost forgot.&nbsp; I have these letters for you.&nbsp; They are from the viewers of the barbecue video.&nbsp; They really liked you two.&nbsp; That was why I wanted you two in the next video."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh, look, mommy," Kimberly said excitedly.&nbsp; "Lots of letters and they are addressed to you and me."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Okay, ladies," Charlie said.&nbsp; "I hate to say it, but I do have to go.&nbsp; I will pick you two up on Saturday morning, Carol.&nbsp; I don't think you should have to drive after doing this."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Kimberly," Carol said, "why don't you take those letters up to your room?&nbsp; I am going to walk Charlie out to her car."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Okay, mommy.&nbsp; I have to call my friends first and cancel our mall date."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kimberly went to make her calls as Jessica and Carol walked Charlie to her car.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I know you are still uncertain about this, Carol," Charlie said.&nbsp; I honestly cannot blame you.&nbsp; This is a tough decision for any parent to make.&nbsp; I do, however, think it is the right one."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I know, Charlie.&nbsp; I just wish there were other options."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Don't worry, mom," Jessica said.&nbsp; "Kim knows what she is doing.&nbsp; She would never tell you, but I think she is actually wanting to do this.&nbsp; And not only because it would help our sisters."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What do you mean," Charlie asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, you know how small she is.&nbsp; She jokes about it a lot, but when she thinks no one is watching, she cries.&nbsp; She hates being small.&nbsp; Teasing people is the only way she can convince herself that there is something good about her size."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh, baby....." Carol said sadly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The kids at school tease her about it all the time.&nbsp; When we were in middle school, no one wanted her on their team during gym.&nbsp; She wanted to be a cheerleader at one point, but the cheerleaders gave her such a hard time about her size that she dropped it."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No boy will date her because they are afraid their friends will make fun of them because they are dating a 'child'.&nbsp; Her friends don't even like her.&nbsp; They put up with her because they feel sorry for her and it makes them feel good to cater to the 'shrimp'.&nbsp; No, mom.&nbsp; Kim is not doing this against her wishes.&nbsp; She is doing it because this will end the misery she endures everywhere but at home."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Why is she so small," Charlie asked.&nbsp; "Do you know?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes," Carol replied.&nbsp; When I was six months along with her, I was in a terrible car accident.&nbsp; A drunk driver ran a red light and hit me.&nbsp; My car was totaled and I was pinned behind the steering wheel.&nbsp; The paramedics were able to get me out, but in the process, my water broke and I entered labor."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Dear god," Charlie said.&nbsp; "Three months early?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes.&nbsp; The doctors were sure she was not going to make it.&nbsp; They kept her in the hospital for two months and then allowed me to take her home.&nbsp; They gave me a checklist of how to take care of her.&nbsp; I followed it to the letter and she survived."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But," Carol continued, "she was like most babies that experience a premature birth.&nbsp; She was small for her age.&nbsp; After a thorough examination, the doctor found nothing wrong but her size.&nbsp; He had me read a book about preemies.&nbsp; I found that most preemies are like that."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"In fact, I had to hold her back a year in school because she was too small to hold the pencil properly.&nbsp; That is why Kimberly and Jessica are in the same grade.&nbsp; If she can find something good in this, then I am okay with it.&nbsp; I will miss her, but she will not feel bad anymore."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I will be by on Saturday morning to pick you two up around 8:00," Charlie said as she nodded.&nbsp; This was the hardest thing she ever did, but she knew it was for a good cause.&nbsp; "The shoot will start at 10:00am."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"We will be ready," Carol said.&nbsp; "Should we do anything to prepare?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No," Charlie replied.&nbsp; "We will take care of that at the studio."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Okay.&nbsp; Goodbye, Charlie.&nbsp; And thank you."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh, one last thing," Charlie said.&nbsp; "I almost forgot.&nbsp; The girls snuffed by their mothers must be at least 18 for this to be legal.&nbsp; How old are you, Jessica?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I turn 18 next Tuesday."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Then there is no problem.&nbsp; I will see you Saturday, Carol.&nbsp; Goodbye."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kimberly was upstairs crying.&nbsp; Her friends just did not understand.&nbsp; When she told them that she couldn't go to the mall, they just ripped on her, calling her a little kid and other mean things.&nbsp; They would never understand that, because Kimberly would be dead in about 48 hours, she wanted to spend as much time with her family as possible.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hearing the front door close, Kimberly decided to take a shower before her mom and sister saw her.&nbsp; Kimberly did not want them to know she had been crying.&nbsp; Grabbing a towel, she disappeared into the bathroom.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jessica, coming up to see Kimberly, entered her older sister's room.&nbsp; Immediately, she knew there was a problem.&nbsp; The phone was across the room, the handset lying on the floor.&nbsp; Looking in the wastebasket, Jessica was not surprised to see the used tissues.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jessica's sister's 'friends' were less then subtle when it came to showing their displeasure with Kimberly.&nbsp; They probably said something horrible and made Kimberly cry.&nbsp; That was the reason for the shower.&nbsp; It would give Kimberly time to calm dawn and wash away the signs of the tears.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jessica shook her head in anger and left the room as it was.&nbsp; It would not do to let her sister know that Jessica knew how miserable she was.&nbsp; Kimberly was normally very good about hiding her pain.&nbsp; This secret was one that Kimberly should be allowed to keep.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once she was in the kitchen, Jessica got a glass of chocolate milk and sat at the table.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Where's your sister," Carol asked.&nbsp; "I thought you were going to read the letters with her." &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Kim's in the shower so I thought I would wait."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Are you sure about those things you told me and Charlie?&nbsp; I mean about how Kimberly feels.&nbsp; She never tells me anything about her feelings."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm sure," Jessica replied.&nbsp; "Please don't tell her, but I think that we are the only real friends she has.&nbsp; That is also part of her acceptance of this.&nbsp; It is a way she can help those that truly matter to her."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I am going to keep your little sisters out of school tomorrow.&nbsp; I was thinking of going to the beach.&nbsp; We could have a picnic and play in the water.&nbsp; Then, if the little ones are not too tired, we could go to a movie and have dinner at a restaurant."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That sounds great, mom," Jessica said with a smile.&nbsp; "Count me in."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Count you in on what, little sister," Kimberly said as she came into the kitchen and, sitting on Jessica's lap, finished off the younger sister's chocolate milk.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Dammit, Kim," Jessica said indignantly as she pushed her sister onto the floor, "that was mine."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Did you see that, mommy," Kimberly asked innocently.&nbsp; "Child abuse.&nbsp; I think we should call the SPCA on her."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Everyone laughed at Kimberly's joke but Jessica was concerned.&nbsp; It was only when Kimberly was really hurt that she started on the jokes at her own expense.&nbsp; Jessica knew it was a way of dealing with the pain.&nbsp; Yes; a day of fun was just what Kimberly needed.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"We're talking about a picnic tomorrow," Jessica said.&nbsp; "Mom is going to keep our sisters home from school and we are going to the beach for a picnic.&nbsp; Mom was also thinking about a dinner and a movie for tomorrow night."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Wow," Kimberly said excitedly.&nbsp; "That does sound great."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Then it is a done deal," Carol said.&nbsp; "I am going to go call your sisters' school and explain that they will be absent."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Um..." Kimberly began hesitantly.&nbsp; "What are we going to tell them about why we are going on a picnic tomorrow."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hmmmm," Carol said thoughtfully.&nbsp; "Let me think on it and I will have something by the time they get home this afternoon.&nbsp; After I call the school, I am going to take a nap.&nbsp; I have to say that I do not fully understand why you would want to go through with Charlie's plan, but if you do....."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I do," both daughters said simultaneously.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Then," Carol continued, " we will do this.&nbsp; Just do not expect me to like it.&nbsp; I am sorry, but I will need a little time to think this over."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I understand, mommy," Kimberly said.&nbsp; "Do you want to take some of the letters with you?&nbsp; The ones that Charlie brought with her?&nbsp; They might cheer you up."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You know?&nbsp; I think I will take a few of them," Carol said.&nbsp; "Right about now, I could use something to cheer me up."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kimberly handed half the stack to her mother and her mother left.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I missed that barbecue," Jessica said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You were too young.&nbsp; It was 18 and over only."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Let me read some of your letters."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Okay," Kimberly agreed.&nbsp; "Let's go up to my room."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The sisters went up to Kimberly's room and spent the next three hours reading the letters.&nbsp; Some of them were very descriptive and others had pictures to go with them.&nbsp; Kimberly set a few ot the letters aside to show her mother later.&nbsp; There was one, by a man who went by the name David647, that was particularly interesting.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What does he mean, you were hot together?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh," Kimberly giggled.&nbsp; "After I had sex with this one girl named Miranda, I somehow ended up licking mommy's pussy.&nbsp; Everyone seemed to like it and it tasted good.&nbsp; Kinda sweet."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Holy shit," Jessica exclaimed.&nbsp; "You actually licked mom's pussy?&nbsp; That is incest."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Jessica, the day after tomorrow, mommy is going to kill me.&nbsp; Who cares about incest?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hmmm," Jessica said thoughtfully.&nbsp; "Good point."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They xontinued reading the letter and laughed at a few while they were amazed by some of the pictures some of the viewers sent.&nbsp; More than a few were from women.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At 2:45pm, there was a knock on Kimberly's door.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Can I come in, honey," Carol asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Sure, mommy," Kimberly replied.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I thought of what we are going to tell your sisters."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh," Jessica asked.&nbsp; "What are we going to say?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"We will tell them that I got a call this morning informing me that both you and Kimberly were selected from the pool.&nbsp; Kimberly will be processed this Saturday and you will be processed next Saturday."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But if you don't make it to the second round....."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Then I will receive a second call next week telling me that it was a mistake and it was a different Jessica Allen that they needed to notify.&nbsp; They saw that Kimberly had a sister, Jessica Allen and assumed you were the one selected.&nbsp; They then found that their Jessica Allen had a different address."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That sounds pretty good, mommy," Kimberly said.&nbsp; "That should work."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol took a moment to look at her daughters.&nbsp; Anyone who looked at them would have sworn that Jessica was the elder of the two.&nbsp; She was more than a foot taller than her older sister.&nbsp; Also, Kimberly still called her 'mommy' where Jessica called her 'mom'.&nbsp; 
Kimberly's speech and her size made her seem years younger than she was.&nbsp; Carol would have to make sure that she had paperwork proving Kimberly was 18 to Charlie on Saturday.&nbsp; Carol did not want anyone getting into trouble over this.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Ok," Carol said.&nbsp; "Well, your sisters will be home in about an hour.&nbsp; I have already talked to the school and they are excused for tomorrow.&nbsp; How are things going in here?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Good, mommy," Kimberly said with a smile.&nbsp; "I have a letter I would like you to look at."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Here it is," she continued as she handed the letter to her mother.&nbsp; "It is from a David647.&nbsp; I think we could use that letter in the show on Saturday."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol took a moment to read the letter.&nbsp; She was not happy about it, but it did look like the letter would fit with the scene.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Okay, honey," Carol said to Kimberly.&nbsp; "We will do that.&nbsp; I am kind of concerned about the torture part, though."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Don't be," Kimberly said.&nbsp; "Mommy, I will be honest with you.&nbsp; I expect this to hurt.&nbsp; I will probably scream and cry and beg very convincingly because the screams, the crying, and the begging will be real.&nbsp; I want you to promise me, though, that regardless of what I say or do, you will go through with it."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh, baby," Carol whispered.&nbsp; "I don't know if I can."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You have to, mommy.&nbsp; This is for Michelle, Melissa, and Kelly.&nbsp; I am the first step.&nbsp; Kill me and then, if you win, kill Jessica.&nbsp; That will allow you to raise our sisters.&nbsp; That is all Jessica and I want."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Kim has that right, mom."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol sighed heavily.&nbsp; She had realized that she would be killing Kimberly, but had not fully processed the information that Kimberly would be in tremendous pain and would be begging her to stop.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But, baby....."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No, mommy," Kimberly interrupted.&nbsp; "I know what you are thinking.&nbsp; But I need your promise.&nbsp; No matter what I say or do, you will go through with it and kill me.&nbsp; Okay?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Okay, dear," Carol said sadly.&nbsp; "I promise that I will kill you no matter how you beg, scream, or cry."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Excellent," Kimberly said with a smile.&nbsp; "Thank you, mommy."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I have to go," Carol said, rising quickly in an attempt to hide her tears.&nbsp; "I have to go to the store to get dinner for tonight."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Okay, mommy.&nbsp; Would you like Jessica or me to come with you?&nbsp; One of us can stay here for when our sisters get home from school."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Um...no, dear.&nbsp; I will be fine by myself.&nbsp; You just enjoy yourselves."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol left before a sob could make her betray herself.&nbsp; She did not want the girls to know how much this ordeal hurt her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Did you really have to do that," Jessica asked angrily.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, Jess," Kimberly said sadly.&nbsp; "I did."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jessica sat up and looked at her sister.&nbsp; Kimberly always used her siblings full name - Jessica, Michelle, Melisse, or Kelly - unless something serious was going on.&nbsp; Then, she tended to shorten the names.&nbsp; Jessica became Jess, Michelle became Shell, Melissa became Liss, and Kelly became Kell. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Looking at Kimberly, Jessica saw something that truly scared her.&nbsp; Kimberly was crying.&nbsp; Sure, the small older sister had cried before, but never where anyone could see.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm sorry, Jess," Kimberly continued.&nbsp; "I have to do this when our sisters are not here.&nbsp; I have to kind of desensitize her to this.&nbsp; I have to try to let her see this as kind of a good thing."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You saw her.&nbsp; She has agreed to do this, but it is killing her.&nbsp; She thinks that she is the most horrible mother in the world because she is planning on killing me, and possibly you.&nbsp; If she hesitates, then all is lost and I will die for nothing.&nbsp; Mom will die too."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I know Charlie and she is serious.&nbsp; If mom loses the first round, Charlie will do as she said and help you all she can.&nbsp; But neither you, not Charlie is who our sisters need.&nbsp; They need mommy."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jessica was impressed.&nbsp; Kimberly must have been thinking about this since Charlie left.&nbsp; And Jessica had to agree.&nbsp; While she - with Charlie's help - might be able to raise her younger sisters, their mom was the best person for the job.&nbsp; Kimberly was willing to go through horrible pain and suffering - with a smile on her face if she could manage it - to make things as easy on their mother as possible.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I think I understand, Kim.&nbsp; What can I do to help?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Watch me.&nbsp; I am kind of scared, but I do not dare show that to mommy.&nbsp; If I start to frown or look depressed, do something to snap me out of it.&nbsp; I want mommy to think I truly want to do this."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Do you?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Huh?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Do you truly want to do this," Jessica clarified.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You know," Kimberly said after a moment, "I really do.&nbsp; I do not want to say this to mommy, but I don't have any real friends.&nbsp; My 'friends' use me to feel good about themselves.&nbsp; They think that are so nice because they put up with the 'shrimp'.&nbsp; At times, I hate them."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"There are other problems.&nbsp; I know now, that I will never get any taller.&nbsp; I am 4'2" tall.&nbsp; My doctor says that, at this point in my life, it is extremely unlikely that I will grow anymore.&nbsp; I will never be able to drive because I am too short.&nbsp; I will always be a burden on someone."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But now, I have the option of doing something worthwhile.&nbsp; I have the chance to be useful, for once.&nbsp; I can sacrifice my life to give our sisters a better home.&nbsp; Even if mommy and I fail on Saturday, the girls will be taken care of.&nbsp; I know I said mommy was the best for the job, but I think that you and Charlie, working together, would be almost as good."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"If I do not do this, though, mommy will die anyway and you and I will have to raise our sisters.&nbsp; I love them too much to subject them to that.&nbsp; No, Jess.&nbsp; This is the best way."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol, leaning against the wall in the hallway heard all of this and gathered her courage.&nbsp; Kimberly was right.&nbsp; She was brave and foolish, but she was also right.&nbsp; This was the best way.&nbsp; Carol was not sure how she would manage, but she would see it through.

-----

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That Friday passed all too quickly for Kimberly and Carol.&nbsp; Everyone had a good time.&nbsp; The little girls loved going to the beach.&nbsp; Being January, it was very early in the year, but southern California didn't seem to care.&nbsp; The weather was still warm enough to permit swimming.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As promised, they went to dinner at a family restaurant and later, went to go see a movie that Kimberly wanted to see.&nbsp; Carol was relieved that Kimberly's tastes in movies were such that there was no problem taking the little girls with them.&nbsp; Surprisingly, even Jessica seemed to like the movie, a story about a lost pet.&nbsp; This kind of tale was not normally to Jessica's liking.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The little girls were sad that Kimberly was going to die the next morning.&nbsp; They did, however, understand that that was life.&nbsp; Each of them had friends that had lost a mother or sister to the lottery.&nbsp; It just sucked that, this time, it was 'their' sister that was going to die.&nbsp; And to think that Jessica would be done on the following Saturday, well that was sad, too, but they did understand.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kimberly, however, was secretly ecstatic that the girls bought the story about the meat processing.&nbsp; It was even true, in a sense.&nbsp; But it made it easier on them and therefore, easier on their mother.

-----

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kimberly awoke at 7:00am on Saturday morning to her mother's knock on her door.&nbsp; Kimberly had slept poorly.&nbsp; She was torn between being scared and excited.&nbsp; Part of her mind was doing somersaults and the other part of her mind was looking up the number to the men in the white coats.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Come, in," she called as her mother knocked again.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol came in.&nbsp; She was already dressed.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Morning, sweetie.&nbsp; I hate to say it, but it is time to get ready.&nbsp; Charlie will be here in about an hour."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Okay, mommie," Kimberly said with a smile.&nbsp; "Thank you for waking me.&nbsp; I do want to get a shower before we go.&nbsp; Gotta look good for the cameras."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh, damn," Carol cursed.&nbsp; "I need a shower, too.&nbsp; Do you want to take one together?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That would be nice.&nbsp; I will wash your back and you will wash mine.&nbsp; My back, and maybe....other places."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You are a bad girl," Carol said with a chuckle.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You got it," Kimberly said, striking a rididulous pose.&nbsp; "That's me.&nbsp; Bad to the bone."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol playfully swatted her daughter on the butt.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, Miss Bad-To-The-Bone, let's get you cleaned up, shall we?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Lead the way, mommy."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Forty-five minutes later, both women were cleaned, dressed, and sitting on the couch, nervously watching the clock on the mantlepiece.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Morning, mom," said Jessica as she came down the stairs.&nbsp; "Morning, Kim.&nbsp; Just waiting for Charlie to get here?" 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yep," said Kimberly.&nbsp; "She said she would be here at 8:00."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Kim," Jessica said.&nbsp; "I just want you to know I love you."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I know, sis.&nbsp; I love you too."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I will miss you, you know."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well," Kimberly said with a mischievous smile, "with luck, you won't have to miss me for long.&nbsp; A week should do it.&nbsp; Right, mommy?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Right, dear," Carol said absently.&nbsp; She was starting to have difficulties again.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hey mommy," Kimberly said.&nbsp; "What was the name of that amusement park you took us too last year?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Family FunTime, I think."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, I was thinking.&nbsp; I have about $400 in my piggie bank in my room.&nbsp; When you get home this afternoon, why don't you take Jessica, Michelle, Kelly, and Melissa to that amusement park.&nbsp; That would be fun, right?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol could see what Kimberly was trying to do.&nbsp; And she was right.&nbsp; Being down about this was only going to make it worse for everyone.&nbsp; The trip to the amusement park might just be what they need after this morning's activities.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, dear," Carol said, forcing a believable smile as she began to feel a little better.&nbsp; "That would be nice.&nbsp; Do you think you and your sisters would like that, Jessica?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Uh, yes, mom.&nbsp; I know they would love it.&nbsp; I think I would enjoy it, too."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A knock on the door interrupted further conversation.&nbsp; Opening the door, Carol let Charlie in.&nbsp; Charlie, seeing Kimberly and Jessica smiling, was relieved a bit.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Are we ready, girls," Charlie asked Carol and Kimberly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes," Kimberly answered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, echoed Carol.&nbsp; "Um, Charlie.&nbsp; About how long do you expect this to take.&nbsp; Obviously, I have never done this kind of thing before."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It will take about an hour.&nbsp; We will start at 10:00 and should be done by 11:00."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Okay, then," Carol said, turning to Jessica.&nbsp; "Jessica, please have the girls ready to go by noon, okay?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Sure thing, mom."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jessica ran up to her big sister and, sinking to one knee, hugged Kimberly close.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Remember, Kim," Jessica whispered so their mother would not hear.&nbsp; "I love you.&nbsp; Thank you for doing this.&nbsp; This will likely give me the courage to do the same next week."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kimberly grabbed Jessica's head and planted a kiss on her sister's lips.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I love you, too, Jessica," she whispered.&nbsp; "Take care of mommy today.&nbsp; This is going to be very hard on her."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jessica could only nod as she got to her feet and watched her sister leave the house for the last time.&nbsp; The crushing sadness she felt was nearly overwhelming.&nbsp; After watching her sister and mother leave in Charlie's car, Jessica gave into her grief and, running up to her room, threw herself on her bed and cried until her little sisters came to her an hour later.

-----

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Are you going somewhere this afternoon," Charlie asked Carol.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes," Carol replied.&nbsp; "We are going to go to Family FunTime."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That will be nice.&nbsp; I understand that they have fireworks every evening."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes.&nbsp; The little girls will love it."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They talked about the afternoon's outing all the way to the studio.&nbsp; Kimberly sat in the back quietly and smiled as she realized that Charlie was trying to make things easier for her mother.&nbsp; She was right.&nbsp; Charlie really was a good person.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They arrived at the studio at 8:45 and Kimberly was taken into the bathroom to get cleaned out completely.&nbsp; The crew were professionals and they would not allow Kimberly to ruin things by soiling herself as she died.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol was having her hair done and getting make-up applied.&nbsp; Everyone wanted her looking like the beautiful, loving mother she was.&nbsp; Carol thought it was a bit ludicrous as she would be filmed killing her oldest daughter.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To top it off, she, Charlie, and Kimberly had agreed to use David647's letter as inspiration.&nbsp; Carol would wear an 18-inch strapon dildo and use that to fuck her daughter to death.&nbsp; Also, she would use her daughter's panties to strangle her while fucking her.&nbsp; Charlie thought it was a great idea, likely to guarantee Carol a win in the first round.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol had just finished putting on the strap-on as the crew brought out a mattress and laid it on the floor of the studio.&nbsp; It was a kingsize mattress that would allow Carol and Kimberly to move around freely as they put on their show.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol sat on the mattress and noticed Kimberly coming from the bathroom.&nbsp; It was 9:50 and they would start in ten minutes.&nbsp; Looking at Kimberly, she was shocked.&nbsp; The naked 18-year-old really did look beautiful.&nbsp; Her hair had been done like her mother's but no make-up had been used.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kimberly sat on the mattress next to her mother and looked at her mother's huge tits.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Wow, mommy," Kimberly said, "I didn't notice in the shower this morning, but you have some really big boobs.&nbsp; What size are they?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"They are a 48F, sweetie," Carol said with a chuckle.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I am so jealous.&nbsp; I never even needed a training bra."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That is ok, sweetie.&nbsp; There are a lot of women with tiny breasts.&nbsp; See that camera person over there?&nbsp; She has very small breasts and she is older than you."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Looking over, Kimberly saw that her mother was right.&nbsp; Everyone in the crew was a woman and most of them had stripped completely.&nbsp; One of the women holding cameras was flat as a board.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Wow," Kimberly said.&nbsp; "So I wouldn't have been the only woman with no boobs."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No, honey," Carol said with a smile.&nbsp; "You would not have been the only one."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Are we ready," Charlie asked the two as she came up.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yep," Kimberly said cheerfully.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Uh, so, Charlie," Carol said, "is there a premise to this thing or do I just fuck and snuff her?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh, fuck, mommy.&nbsp; Look at the size of that thing.&nbsp; I can't believe you are going to be using that on me."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Shane," Charlie called, "I think you can better answer Carol's question.&nbsp; What is the premise here?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shane, the coordinator of the event was looking at the mother and daughter on the mattress while she masturbated.&nbsp; This was going to be so hot.&nbsp; She knew that Kimberly was 18, but the girl certainly did not look it.&nbsp; Any viewer who paid attention to the disclaimer running along the bottom of the screen would know all performers were 18 or older, but she was sure that a few would still be taken by Kimberly's youthful appearance.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Shane," Charlie called again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh," Shane exclaimed as she came out of her daydream.&nbsp; "Ahem..... You're appearing on a special undergroung snuff porn broadcast.&nbsp; Every week, millions of guys take off their pants, lube up their cocks, and settle back to masturbate while they watch mothers scheduled for execution compete to see who can put on the best show snuffing their teenage daughters.&nbsp; If the mother and daughter do a good job and make the audience - polled randomly, in person, by nude female staff members - cum real good, they move on to the final round.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That's some premise," Carol said.&nbsp; "But what if they don't?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, then they keep their appointment with the executioner."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol thought this over for a bit as they waited for the fiim crew to finish setting up.&nbsp; Charlie had said that it might take a few more minutes.&nbsp; Kimberly, in the meantime, was looking at her mother, noticed a pool of girl-cum forming beneath the older woman.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Wow, mommy," Kimberly said in awe, "you are soaking.&nbsp; You are really getting off on the thought of snuffing me?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm just thinking of all those guys watching us, honey.&nbsp; All those guys with their big, throbbing cocks just waiting for me to snuff my little girl."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, do a good job on me," Kimberly said, "Okay, mommy?&nbsp; Charlie says she needs you to make me cry and scream and stuff."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Don't worry, sweetie. You just be brave.&nbsp; Mommy's so proud of you."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Thanks, mommy," Kimberly replied as she touched the 18-inch rubber cock.&nbsp; "Charlie says that you will get a bonus if you get this whole thing inside me.&nbsp; I do not know, though.&nbsp; It is so bige, it is almost half as tall as I am.&nbsp; If you get it all the way inside me, it will rip me up inside and go all the way up into my ribs."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That's right, baby.&nbsp; Mommy is going to do her best.&nbsp; Now hush.&nbsp; I think they are ready for us."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charlie and Shane came over to the women on the mattress.&nbsp; Shane still had her fingers buried in her crotch.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Okay, Carol,� Shane said.&nbsp; �We will be starting in just a few minutes.&nbsp; You will spend the first part talking to the audience, introducing yourself and Kimberly.&nbsp; Charlie tells me you have a fan letter that fits with the theme of this show so if you want to read it to the camera, feel free.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�The important thing,� Shane continued, �is to stay as calm as you can.&nbsp; I have seen some mothers lose it halfway through and be unable to continue.&nbsp; At that point, it is often to late to help the daughter anyway and this inability to continue kills any chance of that mother making it to the finals.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I understand,� Carol said.&nbsp; �Kimberly has made me promise to continue to the end no matter what.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Kimberly is a good girl,� Shane said, looking at the 18-year-old, �isn&#8217;t she?&nbsp; She knows what is at stake here and is ready to go all the way.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yep,� Kimberly said with a smile.&nbsp; �I will put on as good a show as I can.&nbsp; I only hope my death is sexy enough to help mommy win.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well,� Shane said to Kimberly, �you are so sexy, that, if your mommy can make it to the end, she will stand a pretty good chance of making it to the finals.&nbsp; Now, good luck.&nbsp; We will start in 60 seconds.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol repositioned herself so she faced the cameras.&nbsp; Kimberly sat in front of her mother.&nbsp; Her head coming only up to her mother&#8217;s shoulder, Kimberly really did look like a child.&nbsp; Their hearts started to race as they saw the clock run down.&nbsp; As the light on the camera turned red, showing they were on the air, Carol took a deep breath and began to speak.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hi, everybody.&nbsp; I'm Carol and this is my daughter, Kimberly.&nbsp; We're going to be putting on a show for you, tonight.&nbsp; We've been getting just a ton of email from all you guys out there since our mother/daughter barbecue.&nbsp; This has been such a turn-on.&nbsp; The ones that included pictures were especially nice.&nbsp; Kimberly loves those.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Here's a special one we got from David647 a few weeks ago,� Carol continued.&nbsp; �He says &#8216;Carol, I just saw you and Kimberly in that barbecue bit where she's getting her first taste of pussy flesh.&nbsp; I thought you two were sooo hot together!&nbsp; I just came in a bug gush right then.&nbsp; I just can't stop fantasizing about you.....&#8217;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oooh, see Kimberly,� Carol asked as she showed the letter to Kimberly.&nbsp; �He sent pictures.&nbsp; Heehee...OH MY GAWD..mmm...he's kind of cute like that, isn't he, honey?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh, sorry everyone,� Carol said apologetically.&nbsp; �Anyway, he goes on to say &#8216;have you ever thought about doing a snuff scene with her?&nbsp; I'd really like to see you fuck her pussy with a big cock and put her through all that snuff and torture stuff....making her cry and scream and beg.&nbsp; That would be so hot.&nbsp; It just drives me nuts thinking about it.&#8217;

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol paused as Kimberly changed positions and started sucking on her mother&#8217;s right breast.&nbsp; Carol almost lost track of what she was doing.&nbsp; Looking it back towards the cameras, she pulled herself together and continued.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well, David, I hope you are watching because I am going to snuff Kimberly right now.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes.&nbsp; That&#8217;s it, baby,� Carol said to her daughter.&nbsp; �Suck on mommy&#8217;s tit.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That&#8217;s right, David, � Carol continued as she looked back at the camera.&nbsp; �I am going to fucking rape her.&nbsp; I am going to put my little girl to death.&nbsp; Just for you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Looking back down at Kimberly, Carol sighed nervously.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you ready sweetie,� she asked the 18-year-old.&nbsp; �It is time.&nbsp; Give mommy a hug and a kiss before we begin.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kimberly knew what she was doing.&nbsp; Looking up to her mother, she smiled.&nbsp; She then looked at the camera and with a smile to the camera, she hugged her mother tightly and gave the older woman a solid kiss on the lips.&nbsp; Still looking at the camera, she then sunk down and started licking the dildo her mother wore.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, baby,� Carol said.&nbsp; �Put your wrists behind your back and suck on that big cock.&nbsp; Get it nice and slippery.&nbsp; Oh, baby, mommy&#8217;s going to fuck you so good.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Now,� Carol said as she pulled her daughter off the rubber cock and shoved a gag into the 18-year-old&#8217;s mouth, �take your gag.&nbsp; Mommy does not want to have to worry about you screaming just yet.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol strapped the gag in place and then bound her daughter&#8217;s wrists behind her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Now spread those legs, sweetie,� she said.&nbsp; �Mommy&#8217;s going to bust your cherry.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol placed the head of the dildo at the entrance of her daughter&#8217;s pussy and pushed gently.&nbsp;&nbsp; At first, there was no progress.&nbsp; Then, with a muffled scream from Kimberly, the huge dildo plunged four inches into her virgin pussy.&nbsp; Kimberly gasped in pain as her mother removed the gag.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you okay, sweetie,� Carol asked her daughter.&nbsp; �Did I hurt you?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes,� sobbed Kimberly.&nbsp; �Uh-huh�..�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well,� Carol replied softly, �you are a woman now; ready to be fucked and snuffed, baby.&nbsp; Now, hand me your panties and hold out your neck.&nbsp; Mommy&#8217;s going to choke you while she fucks this big cock into you for real.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kimberly sobbed as she retrieved her panties and gave them to her mother.&nbsp; Blood from her torn hymen was starting to run down the inside of her thigh.&nbsp; Getting on her hands and knees, she moved her hair out of the way to allow her mother to wrap the panties around her throat.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, baby,� Carol said as she wrapped her daughter&#8217;s panties around the teenager&#8217;s throat, �nice and snug.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ahhh,� Kimberly whimpered, �no, mommy�..please, no���
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh, there you go, baby,� Carol said as she rammed the dildo six inches into her daughter&#8217;s pussy. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh, sweetheart,� Carol continued as Kimberly moaned, �you are such a slut!&nbsp; I think I need to punish you.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sliding the dildo in another inch, Carol leaned over her daughter&#8217;s back and kissed the girl&#8217;s cheek.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You doing okay, baby,� Carol asked in a whisper as she eased up on the panties allowing her daughter to breathe a bit. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It is okay, mommy,� Kimberly sobbed, barely audibly.&nbsp; �Most of this begging and crying is for the camera.&nbsp; �Just remember your promise, please.&nbsp; You have to continue, no matter what.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know, baby,� Carol whispered as she continued thrusting the plastic cock into her daughter.&nbsp; �I will do it.&nbsp; Just don&#8217;t ask me to like it.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As far as the cameras and the crew were concerned, they saw and heard no words spoken.&nbsp; They just saw Carol hunched over her daughter as she continued fucking the 18-year-old.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You know,� Carol asked loudly enough for the cameras to pick up as she straightened up, �I think I need to pound this cock all the way up into your belly, this time.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol released the panties completely as she changed positions to get a better angle.&nbsp; Grabbing the ends of the panties again, she pulled them tight enough to make breathing difficult &#8211; but not impossible &#8211; for the teenager.&nbsp; Slamming the dildo back into her daughter&#8217;s pussy, Carol felt the girl&#8217;s cervix give way as the dildo slid eight inches into Kimberly.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes,� Carol cried triumphantly for the camera, �Here it comes, baby.&nbsp; Here it comes.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mommy,� Kimberly squeaked as she felt the dildo slide into her womb.&nbsp; �Oh, god, mommy�.no�.please�.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol pulled out and slammed the dildo back in�.nine inches this time.&nbsp; Kimberly shrieked when she felt her womb tear as the dildo continued into her abdomen.&nbsp; Carol instinctively realizes what has happened and knows that, even if Kimberly would allow it, there was no turning back now.&nbsp; The damage was done.&nbsp; The girl would bleed out before they could get her to a doctor.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes�.oh, take it, baby,� Carol said.&nbsp; �Take it all.&nbsp; Oh my god�.yes.&nbsp; Mommy&#8217;s killing you, baby; nice and slow.&nbsp; Oh, sweetie, mommy&#8217;s killing you so good.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mmmm,� Carol moans as she turns back to the camera while driving the dildo deeper and deeper into her daughter&#8217;s torso.&nbsp; �David, are you stroking that big cock?&nbsp; Yes?&nbsp; Are you imagining this is you....mmm...thrusting that big cock into my Kimberly's body?&nbsp;&nbsp; Punishing her, baby?&nbsp; Yes....uhn...nice and slow....letting her feel every inch.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ohhhh, mommy,� Kimberly sobs, not acting anymore.&nbsp; �It hurts���

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kimberly&#8217;s eyes widen as she feels the head of the dildo entering her chest.&nbsp; This is far more pain than she anticipated.&nbsp; She knew she didn&#8217;t have much longer.&nbsp; Her mother was doing great.&nbsp; Kimberly just hoped that her mother could carry it through to the end.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, baby,� Carol says to the camera, �give it to her, David.&nbsp; Are you ready to give it to her?&nbsp; That big gush of your cum inside her as she dies?&nbsp; Here it comes, baby.&nbsp; I am going to snuff her.&nbsp; I am going to snuff her now for you.�&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol starts to cry a little as Kimberly&#8217;s body begins to go into its death struggles.&nbsp; The plastic cock in all the way in the 18-year-old and everyone can see the shape of the dildo at the base of Kimberly&#8217;s throat as her body begins to convulse.&nbsp; Carol bends over and kisses Kimberly on the cheek.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Thank you, mommy," Kimberly says, smiling as much as possible as her body shakes uncontrollably.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, baby,� Carol says to the camera, tears rolling down her cheeks.&nbsp; �She's writhing in agony, each thrust of that massive throbbing cock ripping and tearing into her farther.&nbsp; She's sobbing, begging for mercy as it batters relentlessly into her soft, yielding, teenage organs.&nbsp; You're torturing her with it.&nbsp; Letting her take a breath and gripping her tight, you plough back into her, giving her every inch of that massive shaft and holding it there as her body convulses in pain.�
�I feel your orgasm building and twist the panties around her neck, wanting to give you both release as you bury your entire cock inside her.&nbsp; Her eyes go wide as she feels that throbbing meat lurch as you start to spew your hot sticky sperm directly into her gut, taking possession of her body as she convulses in a massive snuff/torture/death....&nbsp; Taking your cum deep inside her as I sacrifice my Kimberly on your cock.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Whew,� Shane says as Kimberly collapses, clearly dead.&nbsp; �I think that&#8217;s a wrap, folks.�

-----

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol was now dressed and sitting in a corner.&nbsp; Staring at the mattress, she could still see her daughter lying there.&nbsp; Never mind the fact that the crew had removed the corpse only minutes after the 18-year-old's death.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charlie came up to Carol, ready to take the distraught woman home.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Are you ready to go, sweetie," Charlie asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; You were right.&nbsp; I do not think I could drive right now."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I have seen this before.&nbsp; Anyway, I can take you home now."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Looking at her watch, Carol saw it was now 10:45.&nbsp; It was amazing to her that the whole thing took less than an hour.&nbsp; An hour ago, her daughter had been alive.&nbsp; Now, the girl was dead and, even worse, her own mother had killed her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Stop that," Charlie said sharply, understanding what Carol was going through.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Stop what," Carol asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Don't play games with me, Carol.&nbsp; I have seen this before, remember?&nbsp; Now think for a moment.&nbsp; Kimberly knew what she was getting herself into.&nbsp; She made you promise to go through with it.&nbsp; She would be very unhappy to see you trashing yourself like that."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You told Jessica that you were going to an amusement park," Charlie continued.&nbsp; "Now calm down and get ready to have a good time this afternoon.&nbsp; Your other daughters need you to be strong right now.&nbsp; If you want to beat yourself up over this - and I really think Kimberly would be mad at you for doing that - do it after you get home.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But what do I tell Jessica," Carol asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Tell her everything went well.&nbsp; Kimberly got what she wanted and she was happy."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What about next week?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, we will not know the results of this until Monday.&nbsp; Of course, I am almost positive that you made it to the next round.&nbsp; Your performance this morning was the best I've ever seen.&nbsp; I will stop by on Monday with the results and the DVD of this performance."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"As for now," Charlie continued, "just try to relax and enjoy the rest of the day with your other daughters."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I will try, Charlie.&nbsp; That is all I can do."

Special Pictorial II

Sunday

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol woke from a troubled sleep on Sunday morning. Looking at the clock, she cursed under her breath as she saw it was 10:15. She should have been up already; making breakfast for the three little girls. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hoping that everyone had slept late - it had been a late night (they did not get back from the amusement park until almost 3:00 that morning) - Carol ran to the bathroom and washed her face. She then ran downstairs to get her coffee and start on some semblance of a normal breakfast. After her first cup of coffee, she started to relax.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hearing the TV on in the living room, Carol poked her head in to see who was up already. Melissa was sitting on the couch, watching TV with her friend, Anna. From the look on Melissa's face, Carol knew something was wrong. Turning to the TV, Carol froze as her heart sunk. On the screen were Carol and Kimberly, fucking away like rabbits. From the bulge in Kimberly's chest, it was obvious that the dildo was deep inside the girl. The scene was almost over.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not waiting for the finale, Carol strode over to the DVD player and ejected the disc.&nbsp; She did not recognize the handwriting, but the title was clear: "Carol kills Kimberly". Shaking nervously, Carol turned to the little girls on the couch.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Where did you get this," Carol asked quietly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"My dad is a fan of that show," Anna said. "He records all the specials. When he recognized you and Kimmie, he called my mom in to watch. They wouldn't let me watch it so I snuck the disc out while they were sleeping and came over here to watch it with Melissa."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What is this, mommy," Melissa asked. "I thought Kimmie was supposed to be killed because of the lottery."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That's exactly right, Melissa," Jessica said as she entered the room. "There was a lottery drawing - of sorts - and because of that, Kimmie died. If everything goes well, it will be my turn next Saturday."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jessica had awoken a few minutes before and come downstairs looking for her own coffee. Like her mother, she had difficulty facing a day without a couple cups of coffee. As she passed the living room, she heard Melissa's question and figured her mother could use a hand.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What do you mean, Jessie? Wasn't Kimmie's name drawn?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No, Melissa," Jessica answered. "Mom's name was. The problem, as Kimmie and I saw it, was that we - your two older sisters - did not have the experience or knowledge to raise you guys and when mom's friend, Charlie, proposed this, Kimmie and I thought it was a great idea."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But what is this?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anna was about to answer but, seeing the look in Jessica's face, she held her tongue.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"This is a contest. Mom is competing with other women in her situation. If she does the best job killing her daughters - Kimmie and me - she will not have to die. She will be able to take care of you, Michelle, and Kelly."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But what is she doesn't beat the others?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well," Jessica answered, "if she doesn't win this week, mom will die as scheduled and I will raise you three. If she wins this week, I will die next Saturday as the contest continues. If she wins that week, she wins the contest and is allowed to live and raise you three."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"If she loses," Jessica continued, "she will die as scheduled. Now normally, that would mean there is no one to take care of you, Kelly, and Michelle, but Charlie - mom's friend - promised to adopt you three and raise you as her own daughters. Kimmie and I felt this was better for you than what we could do. Because of this, we pushed mom into it."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But mommy killed Kimmie. If what you say is true and she wins this week, she will kill you next Saturday. How can she do that?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That is true," Jessica said as she watched tears of grief start to roll down her mother's cheeks, "but remember: she is doing this for you three. Also, she had little choice in the matter. Kimmie and I forced her into doing this. When we found out about this option, we pushed and pushed until mom agreed. She doesn't want to do this, but Kimmie, me, and Charlie knew it was the best way."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And you are ready to die next weekend," Anna asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I am ready to do anything to help my mom and my sisters. If that means dying, I would do it myself. The only problem is that it wouldn't be entertaining enough and mom would lose. So, I will let mom kill me and hope she wins."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Then why did mommy lie to us," Melissa asked. "Why did you and Kimmie?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"She lied because she is ashamed," Jessica answered. "She is convinced that what she is doing is wrong, even though there is no right answer here. Kimmie and I knew it was the best option, but mom still is ashamed that it has come to this."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But......"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No 'buts', Melissa. Think about last night. At the park, you were running around and bumped into that clown, knocking him down. When he fell, he knocked over that stand that had all the stuffed animals. You lied when anyone asked if you ran into that clown."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It was an accident," Melissa said defensively.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That's right. It was an accident and no one was really angry. They just wanted to know what happened. But, because you were embarrassed, you lied about it. You were ashamed that you had caused a mess." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well," Jessica continued, "this is no different. Mom is embarrassed and ashamed. She does not want anyone to know she is killing her own daughters because some people will not understand. They will not understand that Kimmie and I wanted this. They will not understand that mom killed two of her daughters so she could save the other three. That is why she lied."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Melissa looked over to her mother and was shocked. In her confusion, Melissa never noticed what her conversation with Jessica was doing to Carol. The older woman had crumpled to the floor and was shaking as she sobbed in grief over the situation. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That was all the proof Melissa needed. Whatever she saw her mommy do, it was obvious that her mommy did not want to do it. It was as Jessica said; their mommy was being forced into this situation. Rising from the couch, Melissa walked to her mother and knelt down; putting her small arms around the crying woman.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It is okay, mommy," Melissa said. "I understand now. I am sorry I got angry. I didn't know. I love you."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But," Jessica said, "this situation has shown that we need to explain this to Michelle and Kelly. It is ludicrous to believe that none of their friends will know about this. They will be going to school this week and will need to be aware of this before someone in their class makes a big deal about it."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anna had the decency to blush at that. If she hadn't brought the DVD over, this uncomfortable conversation would likely never have taken place. Then she realized that Jessica was actually saying it was a good thing as it forced them to talk with the two youngest sisters before a classmate made it a bigger problem.

-----

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The rest of that day was filled with tears (Carol's mostly) and conversation. The two youngest really did not understand everything, but they did understand that this was all about a tough decision. One decision would have their mother die and leave it to their older sisters to raise them. The other decision was for the two oldest sisters to die, leaving mommy alive to raise the three younger sisters. As much as Michelle and Kelly lover their older sisters, they knew they needed their mother more. No one mentioned the possibility that Carol could lose and still have to die after killing Kimberly and Jessica.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol, though relieved that the little girls accepted the truth and were not holding it against their mother, was still emotionally exhausted at the end of the day. Anna had left early, citing the need to replace the DVD before her parents noticed it was missing. They would be furious if they knew she had watched it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol sleepwalked through the afternoon; preparing dinner for her daughters, overseeing the completion of their homework, and hustling them off to bed. Carol prepared a note to take to Jessica's school the next day, excusing Jessica from school for the following week. She could not see forcing her daughter to go to school, knowing she could die the following Saturday. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If Carol had failed the previous Saturday, Jessica would not need to die as Carol's execution would go forward anyway and she could just enjoy the week with her mother. In that case, Carol would arrange to excuse the three younger girls from school for the rest of the week as well. With these thoughts running through her head, Carol tossed and turned in bed and, finally, fitfully, fell asleep.

----------

Monday

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol woke from a restless sleep at 5:30 Monday morning. Getting up, she washed her face and went downstairs to prepare breakfast for her children. They would need to leave to catch the bus around 6:30. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was almost 6:00 as Carol finished preparing breakfast. Michelle was the first to arrive in the kitchen. Seeing the scrambled eggs, bacon, and sausage, the child smiled and dug in. She was just finishing her breakfast as Kelly and Melissa arrived.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol drank her coffee as she watched the children eat and talk about school. Looking at the scene in front of her, Carol found it hard to believe that the events of the last week had happened. Her children ate and talked as if nothing had changed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol knew better. Those events did happen. When her daughters got to school, it was likely that someone would confront them with the knowledge that their mother had killed their sister. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It wasn't that a parent killing an adult child was illegal (it was legalized 30 years before). As Charlie had said, most parents would understand. Kids, however, could be cruel. It was possible that the girls may need to change schools to avoid persecution.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The three little girls finished getting ready and ran out the door by 6:25. Carol went to the stove to prepare her own breakfast. She was just finishing up when she heard Jessica enter the kitchen.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I told you that you do not have to go to school this week," Carol said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I know. I just didn't see the point in lying in bed any longer. I have been awake for two hours."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Something in her daughter's voice caused Carol to turn from the stove and look at the teenager. Jessica's eyes were puffy and red. It was obvious that the teenager had been crying. Jessica, seeing the concern in her mother's eyes, held up her hand.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It is just that I couldn't let myself cry until Michelle, Kelly, and Melissa were gone. I still believe what I told them yesterday. This is the best course of action. I am sure you succeeded Saturday. I will die this coming Saturday. My tears are not for me."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Then, who?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You," Jessica answered. "I am accepting this. I know I will die in pain, but my pain will be relatively brief. I cannot imagine what you are going through. It tears me up imagining your pain. I saw you crying yesterday. I have never felt pain that caused me to cry like that."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But," the teenager continued, "I will not let you off easy. I know the promise Kimberly exacted from you and I demand the same. No matter what happens, no matter how much I cry or beg, you must follow through and finish me off. Otherwise, Kimberly's death was in vain. Understand?"

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol nodded, sadly.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Good," Jessica said, tears beginning to flow again. "Now promise me. You will see it through to the end."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I will see it through to the end," Carol said as she shook uncontrollably.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Promise!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I will see it through to the end, Jessica," Carol repeated. "I promise."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Further conversation was interrupted by a knock on the front door. Jessica ran to the door and opened it, revealing the visitor to be Charlie.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"May I come in," Charlie asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Uh, sure," Jessica said after a moment. "We just were not expecting you this early."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, we got the results last night so I came over as early as I could. Is your mother here?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yeah. She's in the kitchen. Come on back."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the kitchen, Carol was busy again at the stove. Realizing that the knock was probably Charlie, Carol decided to cook enough for the three of them. Jessica and Charlie sat at the table in silence and watched Carol work. When the food was ready, Carol served it up and sat down to eat.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You are early," Carol said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, we received the results last night and I thought you might like to end your suspense as soon as possible."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You got that right," Jessica said. "How did they do?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well," Charlie said, "we received a lot of excellent reviews and a lot of high votes. Unfortunately, you two came in third. On a consolation note, the three highest scorers were within three-hundredths of a point of each other."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"So Jessica will not have to die then," Carol said, relief clearly visible on her face.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well," Charlie said hesitantly, "it is not that simple. Yesterday, we received an anonymous tip about one of the finalists. This tip may cause them to be disqualified. If that happens, then you two will be on for next Saturday."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"When will you find out," Jessica asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Within the hour. Our investigative team has been working on it all night."

-----

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fifty-five minutes later, Charlie's cell phone rang. A hushed discussion ensued, during which, Charlie's expression darkened considerably. Then something strange happened. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although Charlie was clearly pissed, there was a sense of relief emanating from her. Both Carol and Jessica were confused. All they could do, however, was watch and wait for more information. After a few minutes, Charlie hung up and let out a huge sigh.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Bad news," Jessica asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Not for you," Charlie replied. "The finalist has been disqualified and you two are on for Saturday."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes," Jessica squealed triumphantly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol's reaction, however, was not as upbeat. Yes, the plan her daughter's had cooked up would continue and - really - that was a good thing. Carol, however, was still unhappy about it.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What happened," Carol asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It's an ugly story," Charlie replied. "Are you sure you want to hear it?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes," Jessica said as Carol nodded in agreement.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Okay. I guess there really is no harm in telling you. You would find out Saturday, anyway."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charlie stood up and, with a nod from Carol, refilled her coffee mug. Sitting down, she took a sip and sighed contentedly.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"This is good coffee. Anyway, the disqualified finalist - her name is Theresa Carst, by the way - joined the contest under the same situation as you, Carol. She received her notice and agreed to kill her daughters in an effort to save her life." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Now, here," Charlie continued, "is where you two differ. You are doing this in order to give your three youngest a better chance at a good life. You, in other words, have a good reason for doing this."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Theresa, however, had only two daughters. To save her life, she would have to kill off both of her daughters. Her daughters, Emily and Ailene, however, could not see the logic in killing two people to save one person. They refused."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"We will not take contestants who kill their daughters against their will. First, although it is legal to snuff a unwilling family member for family events (barbecues, picnics, etc.), it is illegal to film the snuffing of an involuntary victim. Second, we - the contest producers - are against involuntary snuff in general."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But Kimberly was crying and begging me to stop," Carol said. "Doesn't that count as involuntary snuff?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Carol," Charlie said patiently, "while the audience may allow themselves to be fooled, everyone there knew that Kimberly was playing it up for the audience. Although the microphones did not pick it up, enough people heard Kimberly thank you for snuffing her. Everyone there knew that this was what Kimberly wanted."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Anyway," Charlie continued, "with Theresa's daughters refusing to die for their mother, Theresa was extremely distressed. Her neighbor - a longtime friend of Theresa's - offered a suggestion. The neighbor, Melanie Killigan, offered to let Theresa snuff Melanie's two daughters Tamara and Serena. They would drug the girls before the events and no one would know that it was someone else's daughter."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The plan worked well. The first daughter, Tamara, died nine days ago at Theresa's hands. I will not go into the details of what Theresa did to the girl, but it impressed the audience. Theresa moved on to the finals."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yesterday, around noon, we received a tip detailing the who situation. At first no one wanted to believe it. I mean, who would sell out her own daughters like that? And don't say you did, Carol. We already discussed how your situation is different. Well, we had the body in storage still so we ran DNA testing. We called in the police and provided the evidence we had."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The police apprehended Theresa and Melanie last night and ran DNA testing. The police lab compared the DNA between Theresa and Tamara. No match. Then they compared between Melanie and Tamara. It was a 98% match. The police were convinced. Theresa had murdered Melanie's daughter. To make it worse, the girl was only 16 years old."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"My god," Carol exclaimed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Tell me about it," Charlie replied. "Not only did we film and broadcast the killing of an unwilling victim, the victim was a minor. We gave all the evidence to the District Attorney and threw ourselves on the mercy of the court. It took an hour, but the courts found us blameless. Theresa and Melanie had taken significant steps to keep us in the dark about Tamara's true identity."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"We talked to the judge and convinced him to let us deal with the criminal mothers. This weekend is the finals. There are only two mother-daughter teams so both will be filmed on Saturday. We will have the results by Sunday. So, on Sunday, we will have a big barbecue. The winning finalist will process Theresa and the losing finalist, as a consolation, will process Melanie."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But what about Melanie's other daughter?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, the other daughter, Tamara's twin sister, Serena, will move in with Theresa's daughters. Theresa's daughters are 19 and 22. They have agreed to take Serena in and take care of her."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"When did you find out all of this," Jessica asked. "You couldn't have resolved all of that in the last hour."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You are right," Charlie said with a smile. "We knew everything but the judge's decision three hours ago. We were just waiting to see if we would be able to process Theresa and Melanie before I could say anything."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"So the end result is that I will kill Jessica on Saturday, right?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Right," Charlie said, seeing that Carol was still less than pleased.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And if I still lose?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The we will do as we discussed last week. I will adopt Michelle, Melissa, and Kelly and raise them as my own. They will know all about you and will never forget you. I will make sure of that. You are too good a friend for anything less."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Good," Jessica said. "Now, mom, don't you need to turn that letter in to my school this morning?"&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh," Carol exclaimed, "that's right. I do need to do that."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And I need to go anyway," Charlie said. "I was thinking about this weekend, though. What I propose is that you and your daughters spend Friday night at my place. We have plenty of room. That way, I can take you and Jessica to the studio on Saturday morning and my husband, Brian, can keep an eye on the younger girls."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That sounds like a great idea," Jessica said with a smile.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yeah," Carol said distractedly. "It does."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Then I will see you Friday afternoon around 4:00pm. Bye, girls."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With that, Charlie left.

-----

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol could not sleep. Now that she knew for certain that she would have to kill Jessica, the uncertainty was gone. The problem was that - uncertainty or not - Carol did not believe she could think up a snuff method interesting enough to allow her to win the contest.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The thought of conceding occurred to her. She would give up and allow herself to be executed. That was best for everyone. Jessica would live and the younger girls would have a stable home. Charlie would help out any way she could.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol's ruminations were interrupted by a knock on the door. It was past 11:00 at night. The little girls should be asleep. Opening the door, Carol found her suspicions to be correct.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Can I come in, mom," Jessica asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Sure, sweetie," Carol replied. "What is it?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You, mom. Kimberly told me how you would handle this and I think she was right. You are thinking about quitting, aren't you?"

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol's reluctance to look her daughter in the eye was all Jessica needed to know she was right.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What are you," Carol asked. "A mind reader?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I don't have to be a mind reader, mom. We all know you live us and would do anything to keep us safe. You wouldn't be you if you didn't try to find a way out of this. I, however, have taken steps to ensure you will not quit."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Wh...wh...what do you mean?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, you know we have that big festival at school coming up, right?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes. That is part of why I was considering putting an end to this foolishness. You would love being a part of that."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"More than you know, mom. If I am not killed by you this weekend, I will be killed at that festival. I volunteered to be meat for the school barbecue."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You what!?!?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I volunteered. I called them after you dropped off the form excusing me from school for the week. They were happy to accept."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But......but why?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"To remove all obstacles from your path. To remove any excuses. I will die one way or another, mom. If you kill me, however, you may end up saving yourself. That is what is best for Kelly, Michelle, and Melissa."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Bu...bu...but....."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No 'buts,' mom. Kimberly was right. If she hadn't insisted on you killing her, you would have weaseled your way out of it. That promise you made her put you in a position where you could not refuse." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You knew how she felt about living. She was miserable and probably would have committed suicide if she had been courageous enough. This way, her death meant something. If you back out of this, she died for nothing. Just like I will if you back out. Yes, I know I would die providing meat for the students and guest at the school festival, but how would that help my family?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The answer, mom, is that it would not. With you gone, and me dying at the festival, who would take care of my little sisters? Charlie would likely still be willing to adopt them. If you go through with this, though, there is a chance you will be able to raise your children yourself. That is worth me dying."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh, Jessica," Carol said. "There are times, kiddo, where you really make me mad. Forcing me into this situation like this is one of those times. Okay. I will do it. I will lose and we both will die anyway, but I will kill you."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Why are you certain you will lose?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The reason I made it this far was Kimberly. Her small body appealed to the audience. The fact that I was killing my daughter - my preteen-looking daughter - appealed to many fantasies out there. I believe most knew that Kimberly was 18, but her small size allowed them to indulge in their sick fantasies."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I fucked her to death, Jessica," Carol sobbed. "I took a dildo that was half as tall as she was and buried it in her small body. The damage caused by forcing it up through her vagina and uterus and up into her chest killed Kimberly. That was the novelty that got me into the finals. And it only placed me as high as third in the rankings. What could I do to top that?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I have been thinking about that," Jessica said. "I do have an idea, but it is going to be extremely painful for me. I will be screaming at the top of my lungs. I will be crying and begging for real; not like Kimberly was."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Then why would we do that?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Because it stands a good chance of winning this contest for you. Another benefit is that it will help other people as well."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What is this idea of yours?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Not yet, mom," Jessica said with a slight smile. "I want to talk to Charlie first to see if it is a reasonable idea. If Charlie agrees, then, I will tell you. In the meantime, however, you need to get some sleep."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"There is one other problem," Carol said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What is that?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Those women," Carol said sadly. "Theresa and Melanie. They will die on Sunday. I am not sure I can do that. I know they deserve it, but I do not think I can do it to them."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well," Jessica said, "they have to die. And it has to be horrible enough that no one will even contemplate repeating their actions. What would you recommend?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I do not know. I just know that, after killing my two daughters, I do not think I could kill anyone else."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jessica smiled sadly. Kimberly had been right. Their mother was in agony over this. Nothing Jessica said right now would make it easier for her. Jessica wished the weekend would come sooner so Carol could get it over and done with. Then, those wounds could start to heal.

----------

Wednesday

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jessica did not get her wish. Time flowed as it always does; one minute at a time. It was not all bad, however. On Tuesday, Carol had called the elementary school and excused the three little girls from school for the week. They were heading out this morning to go to a hot spring resort for two nights. They would come home Friday morning and head over to Charlie's house that afternoon.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jessica was thrilled. She had always wanted to go to the hot springs. Doing so as a family on Jessica's 18th birthday was a great present. She had heard of this resort four years ago and had wanted to go ever since. It had an outdoor bath that was heated by the spring. It was not mixed bathing so it was safe to take the little girls with them.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jessica was also a little relieved and concerned at the same time. She had talked to Charlie about her idea and after Charlie agreed, she gave Jessica some information about this weekend's competition. Jessica was sworn to secrecy and, knowing what she knew, she had to agree. Carol would be better off not knowing anything until Saturday morning.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hey, Jessie," Melissa asked as she bounded into the room, "are you ready to go?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Sure thing. Just let me get my bag and we will go put the things in the car."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jessica finished packing her bag and led Melissa down to the car. Three bags, one each for each little sister, were already in the driveway behind the car. Jessica opened the trunk and put all four bags inside.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You're not looking forward to this," Jessica teased, "are you?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"HEY," Melissa objected with a light punch to her big sister's arm, "it's a hot spring resort. Of course we are looking forward to it."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That's enough, you two," Carol said as she brought her own bag out to the car. "Oh, good. You are ready to go?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At a nod from her four daughters, Carol ordered them into the car as she made a sweep of the house; turning off lights and locking the front and back doors. Five minutes later, they were getting on the freeway and were heading to the resort.

----------

Friday &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol pulled into their driveway. It had been a wonderful time. The girls had been ecstatic to find a game room at the resort. It had a pool table, a Ping-Pong table, and a large television that had several video systems connected to it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The resort was nestled in the mountains and had guided hikes through the surrounding mountainside. The girls had spent most of Thursday morning following their guide as he led them through the trees, pointing out the deer and other wild animals. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The outdoor bath had been Carol's favorite part. The water was hot; almost too hot. The bath was on a level side of the mountain and the view was amazing. The view from the pool showed the wooded valley below and the mountains on the other side. Carol could see for miles and miles. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The only obstruction to the view came in the form of a wall between the men's side and the women's side. This was not mixed bathing; something for which Carol was appreciative. She was not sure she wanted to deal with her little girls' anatomy questions at this time.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The one sad note came as they were leaving. The elderly couple who ran the resort (with the help of a friend) had been delighted with the company of the little girls. Their own children and grandchildren were scattered around the country and rarely, if ever, visited the old couple. They tried to exact a promise to return, but Carol, realizing that Jessica would never be back, only made a vague reply. Carol tried to cheer up on the way home, but her pleasant mood had been shattered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pulling into the driveway at 12:30pm, Carol was surprised to see Charlie waiting for them. Charlie had her swimsuit on and a towel wrapped around her waist. Before Carol and the girls could even get out of the car, Charlie came over.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I thought you were going to pick us up around 4:00," Carol said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I finished up my work early," Charlie replied, "and thought we could spend the afternoon together as well. I have admission tickets for a water park close by and thought you and the girls would like to go."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Somehow, Carol got the feeling Charlie was lying, but a trip to the water park did sound nice. A distraction was just what she needed now. All the way home, she had not been able to pull her mind from the events of the next day.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jessica, avoiding being caught by her mother, winked at Charlie. The older woman winked back. Jessica had seen immediately the effect the morning's conversation with the old couple had on her mother. Jessica knew that, although the younger girls might return to the hot spring, she would not. Looking at her mother, Jessica saw her mother thinking the same thing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All the way home, Jessica, sitting in the back seat with Michelle and Kelly, watched her mother. Carol had been silent almost the whole way home; her only comments being short replies to Melissa's infrequent questions about the scenery. At the last rest stop an hour before, Jessica called Charlie and explained what was happening. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charlie, very sympathetic to Carol's situation, quickly finished what work had to be done before the weekend and arranged to do the rest after the weekend. She talked to Jim, her husband, and he gave her some tickets to a water park he had won in a radio contest. He knew Charlie valued Carol's friendship and wanted to do something nice to distract Carol from her brooding. Charlie put on her swimsuit, grabbed a towel, and quickly drove over to Carol's house. Charlie had been waiting only 5 minutes before Carol pulled into the driveway. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"A trip to the water park does sound nice," Carol replied. "What do you think, girls?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"YEAH," the three little girls cried out happily as Jessica smiled and nodded.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The girls, though they liked the hot bath at the resort, were kind of bored with it. The hike was fun and the game room was awesome, but overall, a water park was a hell of a lot more exciting. They were all for accepting Charlie's invitation.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Thank you, Charlie. We accept. Just give us a few minutes to unload the car and get ready."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You got it."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol and the three little girls went into the house to get ready as Jessica walked over to Charlie.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Thank you, Charlie. You have no idea how much I appreciate this."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Actually, I do. I like your mom a lot, Jessica. A lot. She is so like my sister. My sister died in a car accident two years ago. In your mom, I almost feel I have found my sister again. I would do anything to help her."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"So that is why you have been helping us so much. Anyway, about my idea for tomorrow, will it work? Is it plausible for the contest?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes," Charlie said with a small frown. "It will work. I do not like it because there is nothing we can do to alleviate the pain you will feel, but it will work. You will survive to the end and will be in tremendous pain throughout the whole procedure. Are you sure this is what you want?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I won't lie," Jessica said. "I am scared and I really do not like the idea of the pain, but in the end, this will be novel enough to help mom win and it will help others as well."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I hate to say it, but you are right. This way may be enough to make your mom the winner. The problem is how your mom will take the news tomorrow morning."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"She will do what she needs to do. She is angry I am forcing her to do this, though. She had thought that she would quit and let herself be executed. After killing Kimberly last week, she had real doubts about killing me." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Kimberly saw her death as an end to all her pain," Jessica continued. "Mother understood that and that helped her go through with it. I am not seeking death as a means to end pain. My reason is solely for the benefit of my little sisters. Mother thought she would take you up on your offer to help me raise them. I like you, Charlie and I think that, together, we could raise the girls. It is better, however, for mom to do it."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I agree. I like you girls a lot. If your mother is like a sister to me, you girls are like my nieces. How did you convince her to kill you?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Underhandedly. I volunteered to become meat at my school's festival next month. I made it so I would die regardless of what mom does. If she kills me, however, she has the possibility of winning and negating her own execution."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You sneaky bitch. That would never have occurred to me."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I got the idea while talking to Kimberly last week. We thought I might need more incentive to keep mom in line."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, it seems to be working. Now you should go get ready before your mom gets suspicious of us and our ulterior motives."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You're right," Jessica said with a smile as she ran into the house.

-----

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By 6:00pm, the three little girls were exhausted. They had been on every slide and ride at the park. The bumper boats were great fun. They really liked riding up to the edge of the pool and splashing their mom and Charlie.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol's mood had lightened considerably. Charlie had that effect, Carol realized. Although Charlie was almost ten years younger, the two women had a great deal in common. They liked the same music. They liked the same movies. They even liked the same foods. Carol mentioned, casually, that they were like sisters and Charlie almost snorted her soda through her nose.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Seeing the three little ones almost asleep on their feet, Charlie, Jessica, and Carol got them into the car and headed over to Charlie's house. They would spend the night there and, in the morning, Charlie would take Carol and Jessica to the studio. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jim was delighted with having the little girls there for a day or three. He had always wanted children and, like his wife, was devastated when he found out a groin injury he suffered in high school had left him unable to reproduce. Having the girls around would make him very happy.

-----

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was 11:30pm. Carol sat at Charlie's kitchen table, drinking a cup of decaffeinated coffee. A noise behind her startled the woman from her thoughts and she relaxed only when she saw that it was Jessica.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You should be asleep," Jessica scolded. "You have a big day tomorrow."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Your one to talk," Carol retorted.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What are you thinking about," Jessica asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What do you think? You. I called your school."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And," Jessica asked. She had expected this.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I tried to invalidate your volunteer status."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It didn't work, did it?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No," Carol answered grudgingly. "I do not like this, Jessica. I do not like my hand being forced. You had a full life ahead of you. I didn't want to kill Kimberly and I don't want to kill you."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The reason you couldn't invalidate the volunteer status is because I am 18."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That's right."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"As for the rest, as for forcing your hand, I am sorry. It was necessary, but I am still sorry. Michelle, Melissa, and Kelly need you. They don't need me or Charlie. They need you. Kimberly and I did this because we understand that. Charlie understood that and that is why she suggested it."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Aren't you scared, Jessie?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Scared? I fucking terrified. I don't like pain and I am not trying to escape a life full of misery like Kimberly was."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Then why do it?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"As scared as I am of dying tomorrow, I am even more scared of raising my little sisters. I do not have the patience to do it right. I would ruin them. I am absolutely terrified that I would cause them irreparable harm through my incompetence and ignorance. I cannot do that to them. Especially not when I have the chance to give them what they really need."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh, Jessie."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No, mom. I know you do not want to do this. This is, however, the lesser of two evils. Doing this will help Michelle, Kelly, and Melissa have a better life. I know it and that is why I am committed to seeing this through. I asked you to promise earlier this week. You did, but without understanding why I am doing this. So, I ask again. Will you promise to continue and see this through? Will you kill me and not waver? Please promise me you will."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Okay, Jessie," Carol said as the tears started to flow. "I promise I will kill you tomorrow. I promise I will not waver."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Thank you, mom. Now, we should get to bed. It is going to be a long day tomorrow."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, dear," Carol replied as she put her coffee cup in the dishwasher.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without further words, the two women went to bed.

----------

Saturday

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Saturday morning came quickly. Carol woke to the sunlight streaming in through the window. Looking at the clock, she saw it was 6:15am. Thinking about what she would be doing to her daughter in a short four hours brought tears to her eyes again. She was still crying when Charlie knocked on the door 15 minutes later.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Knock, knock," Charlie said as she opened the door.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Good morning Charlie," Carol said through her tears. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh, you're already awake," Charlie replied. "Did you get any sleep?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes; about five hours."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I would love to let you sleep more, but we need to get you and Jessica ready. We will need to leave in two hours. We are going a bit farther than before."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol nodded. She was curious as to what Charlie meant, but was disinclined to pursue the matter. Getting out of bed, she put on her bathrobe and followed the other woman into the hallway.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Shower," Carol asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You can use the bathroom in my bedroom," Charlie said. "This way, your shower will not be interrupted by the girls as they get up.
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What about Jim?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"He had some errands he had to run before we leave. He will be back in about an hour."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Ok. And Charlie?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Thanks. Last Saturday? Today? I do not know how I would be able to handle them if you were not here."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Nonsense. We are friends, Carol. Good friends. I talked with Jim last night and we agreed. You and the little girls should spend the week here."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What," Carol asked, surprised.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, we just thought it might be a little difficult for you; going back to the house so soon. You are welcome to stay here."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I don't know, Charlie. I will talk it over with the girls. Thanks for the offer, though. It means a lot."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol went through the master bedroom and into the shower. She turned on the cold water and let it pour over her as she sunk to her knees, sobbing. Charlie, hearing the pained cries of her friend, did all she could. She waited.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ten minutes later, the sound of the water changed and Charlie knew her friend had begun washing herself. It was 6:45am; time to wake Jessica. Charlie walked into the 18-year-old's room and he heart lurched.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jessica was lying, nude, on the comforter on the bed. She had three fingers stuffed inside her pussy and was snoring gently. It didn't take a genius to realize the girl had fallen asleep while masturbating.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"C'mon, sweetie," Charlie said as she gently shook Jessica. "It's time to get up."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Huh," Jessica asked as she slowed opened her eyes.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It is time to get up. We need to get you cleaned up and ready to go. Your mother is already in the shower."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jessica suddenly realized her position and sat up straight, her beautiful breasts bouncing. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh my god," Jessica said. "I am sorry, Charlie."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"For what," Charlie asked. "Masturbating? I do it too. All the time."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But I shouldn't be aroused. I am going to die today."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Whoever put that thought into your head is full of shit. It is because you are going to die today that you should be masturbating as much as possible. One, it takes the edge off of your nerves. Two, it makes you feel good. We both know you are going to go through hell today. So to balance that, if possible, you should do whatever it takes to feel good while you can."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh. I hadn't thought of it that way."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I just wish you had told me that you wanted to do that," Charlie said as she opened the bottom drawer of the dresser, revealing eight or ten vibrators and dildoes.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Wow," Jessica said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Like I said, I masturbate a lot. But now is not really the time to do this. Let's get you cleaned up and out."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Out?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes dear," Charlie said. "I need to give you an enema; probably several of them."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I am not sure I like that," Jessica said with a smirk.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Kimberly did not either," Charlie said.&nbsp; "But she did understand it was necessary.&nbsp; You do, too, right?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes.&nbsp; Can't have me making an unanticipated mess as I die."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Correct."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well," Jessica said with a resigned sigh, "let's get it over with."

-----

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At 8:15am, both Carol and Jessica were clean and ready to go.&nbsp; Neither was really looking forward to this, but they understood that, as Jessica said the night before, it was the lesser of two evils.&nbsp; Jim had returned 20 minutes before and was preparing breakfast for the little girls when they awoke.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I almost want to go wake up the girls, myself," Jessica said. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Why don't you," Charlie asked. "They would love to say goodbye."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No," Jessica replied. "We said our goodbyes last night.&nbsp; It would be a teary scene and I am not sure I could keep my composure."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I understand," Carol said. "Kimberly felt the same way."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"If that is the case, then we should go. It is time."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charlie gave Jim a kiss goodbye. Jim, surprising everyone gave Jessica a kiss on the cheek.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Good luck, kiddo. It was a great pleasure knowing you."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jessica blushed a deep scarlet and Charlie, throwing a bemused smirk at Jim, hustled Jessica and Carol out to the car. After one last look back at the house, Jessica climbed into the back seat.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"We ready," Charlie asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No," Carol answered, "but we have no more time.&nbsp; Let's go."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yeah," Jessica agreed.&nbsp; "Let's go."

-----

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Forty minutes later, it dawned on Carol that they were not going to the studio.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Um, Charlie," Carol said, "you mentioned it earlier, but I forgot to ask. You said we were going further than before. Where are we going?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charlie looked in the rearview mirror and saw the shrug Jessica threw her. There was no harm in telling Carol now. The woman would have to find out, eventually.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"We are going to MacPherson's," Charlie replied. "Shane and the crew will meet us there."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"MacPherson's? The meat processing facility?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What are we.....oh no. No, no, no."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, mom," Jessica said. "You promised."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Did you know about this, Jessica?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Actually," Charlie said, "it was her idea."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Um, yeah," Jessica mumbled.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I am going to cook you?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"After a bit," Jessica said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"After...what have you got planned, Jessie?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, do you remember Mrs. Jacobsen?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes. she was your teacher last year that had been in that horrible accident. If I remember correctly, she was horribly burned."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You remember correctly," Jessica said. "She was horribly burned. They would have been able to do surgery to correct that, but there was not enough real skin available."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Real skin? Wait a minute, Jessie. Are you suggesting what I think you are suggesting?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Only if you are thinking that you are going to skin me alive."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Wait a minute, Jessie," Carol said in a shaking voice that betrayed her fear. "I cannot skin you, much less skin you alive.&nbsp; I have never done anything like that."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You can, and will, skin me. They have stimulants they can give me that will keep me alive and alert. You will be wearing an earpiece and someone will guide you through the process."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But...."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No, mom," Jessica said. "This is it. this is the lesser of two evils we talked about, mom. Before you skin me, you will cut out my pussy and cut off my breasts. Then you will skin me from the neck down. They will send my skin to a medical facility where it can be used for skin grafts." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"After I am skinned," Jessica continued, "you will put me in a pot of water and boil me. You can do with my pussy and breasts what you want. I recommend grilling. Once I am dead, you will cut off my head."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh, Jessie, I know I promised, but I am not sure I can do that.&nbsp; That will be an insane amount of pain for you."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes.&nbsp; It will.&nbsp; It will also, however, be a big draw, I think.&nbsp; Over the last two weeks, I have searched fetish sites and the more graphic, you are, the better you will do, I bet.&nbsp; No one would ever admit they like watching young girls die in horrible pain, but anonymously?&nbsp; I bet they would.&nbsp; They would want to see more so they would vote from their heart if they knew their vote would not be traced to them."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Charlie," Carol pleaded.&nbsp; "Please tell her she is wrong.&nbsp; There has to be a better way."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I would love to," Charlie said as she shook her head sadly, "but I cannot.&nbsp; She is right.&nbsp; The studies done show many have a huge fantasy of causing horrendous pain in others.&nbsp; It is a fantasy and most would never do it in real life, but almost all would get off on seeing someone else cause horrendous pain to another person; especially if that other person is a relative.&nbsp; There is something these people find irresistable in watching one family member physically destroy another family member."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"So they would love watching me skin my own daughter alive?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes," Charlie and Jessica said in unison.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol sighed heavily and began to cry again.&nbsp; This was too much.&nbsp; She wanted to quit; to refuse to go along with it.&nbsp; She would much rather die than cause this level of pain to her daughter.&nbsp; The problem, though, was that even if she did quit, Jessica would still die in three weeks.&nbsp; That damned school festival.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Okay," Carol agreed half-heartedly.&nbsp; "You win, Jessie.&nbsp; I will do as you say.&nbsp; But I want you to know it may be a while before I can forgive you for this."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That's okay, mom," Jessica replied as she leaned into the front seat and kissed Carol on the cheek.&nbsp; "I will take comfort in the fact that I am doing everything I can to help Kelly, Melissa, and Michelle.&nbsp; If you could think clearly, you would understand this as well."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh," Carol said, "I understand.&nbsp; I just hate that you manipulated me into this position."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Would you have done it if I hadn't ensured that I would die either way?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I don't know.&nbsp; Probably not."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Probably?&nbsp; You definitely would not have gone through with this.&nbsp; The problem is that you love all of us too much.&nbsp; You keep thinking there has to be a way to save everyone, but there isn't.&nbsp; And while you are looking for this non-existant solution, time is running out."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charlie was impressed.&nbsp; She knew and had known for a while that Carol was just as Jessica described.&nbsp; The fact that Jessica not only knew this about her mother, but planned accordingly in order to make sure her mother did the right thing was amazing.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I thought you said the other finalist would be performing today as well."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"She will," Charlie answered.&nbsp; "They are also going to be at the plant.&nbsp; I am out of the loop, though, and I do not know what that mother will do."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Out of the loop," Carol asked.&nbsp; "Aren't you running this show?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Not this time.&nbsp; I cannot.&nbsp; After last week, I talked with the producers and told them the whole story.&nbsp; Because I want you to win, so badly, we all agreed that a conflict of interest existed and I backed out."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I could offer advice," Charlie continued, "but I have nothing to do with the scoring or filming.&nbsp; When Jessica called me earlier this week with her idea about the processing plant, I passed it on and the producers loved it.&nbsp; That was where my involvement ended."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The women rode in silence for the rest of the trip.&nbsp; Jessica sat in the back seat, worrying about her mother.&nbsp; This had been a hell of a shock and Carol was not handling it as well as Jessica had hoped.&nbsp; She knew that her mother would object, but she thought Carol would come around after a few minutes of explanation.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charlie was also worried about Carol.&nbsp; Carol knew her daughter would die regardless of what she did, but the question was one of pain.&nbsp; Would Jessica's death at the festival be easier or harder than her death at her mother's hands?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If it would be easier, Charlie knew Carol would not go through with the program.&nbsp; The problem was that no one could answer that question.&nbsp; Carol could guess all she wanted, but there was no real way of knowing how Jessica would die at the festival.&nbsp; They all knew girls were often used in torture games before being delived to the kitchens.&nbsp; The girls in those torture games often felt more pain that Jessica would if Carol went along with the plan.

-----

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From the outside, MacPherson's plant looked very unimposing.&nbsp; It was a 5-story-tall building painted gray.&nbsp; There were no windows on the ground floor.&nbsp; The doors were steel doors without windows.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a loading bay where trucks would back in and deliver their load of meat. The bay doors were always closed, however, unless a delivery was being made.&nbsp; This being Saturday, there would be no deliveries.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There would, in fact, be only a handful of employees present to help with any of the machines either mother might need.&nbsp; There was also a safety tech to ensure no one got hurt.&nbsp; Well, no one but the girls being cooked, that was.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the three women entered the building, Jessica hesitated at the door as she gazed up at the sky.&nbsp; It took a moment, but Carol and Charlie noticed that Jessica was not following them.&nbsp; When they saw her at the door, they were concerned when they saw tears rolling down the teenager's face.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Jessica," Carol asked; he concern evident in her voice.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No, mom," Jessica said.&nbsp; "I am fine.&nbsp; It just hit me that this is the last time I will ever look at the clouds.&nbsp; I just wanted to take a good last look."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I understand," Carol said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"We are a few minutes early," Charlie said.&nbsp; "Why don't the two of you sit out here for a bit?&nbsp; I will come get you when we are ready."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Thanks, Charlie," Jessica said as she sat on the curb, looking up into the sky.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol nodded mutely and Charlie went inside.&nbsp; There was a pleasant breeze blowing and it was a moderate 65 degrees.&nbsp; It really was a beautiful day.&nbsp; Carol sat down next to Jessica.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You know, mom," Jessica asked, "as it gets closer and closer, I find myself more and more confused.&nbsp; I am scared out of my wits, yet there is a part of me that says this is the best thing I could ever do.&nbsp; It is that part of me that is keeping me going."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I think I understand," Carol said.&nbsp; "Last Saturday, when I was ki...with Kimberly, my heart hurt so much.&nbsp; The knowledge that that would be an end to Kimberly's pain was the only thing that allowed me to keep my promise."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What is allowing you to keep your promise this time?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I don't know," Carol said as her tears began to flow.&nbsp; "Maybe it is this: I was thinking it would be better for me to die today and let you go to the festival.&nbsp; I knew that you would die there, but I thought that it would be a better death than having me kill you."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But....."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But," Carol interrupted, "then I remembered Missy McAfee.&nbsp; Do you remember her?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Wasn't she my babysitter when I was Michelle's age?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That is right.&nbsp; She was seventeen then.&nbsp; She was drafted as meat at her highschool festival.&nbsp; Before she went to the kitchen, though, they used her as a target for a dart game.&nbsp; The darts were filled with spices that would be used when she was cooked.&nbsp; Although she was in terrible pain, she survived the game, and they took her to the electricity tent for a contest there.&nbsp; Before she was done, she had been in 11 torture games.&nbsp; She was alive and in terrible pain.&nbsp; It lasted for six hours before they delivered her to the kitchen."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Wow."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Although is it not common that a meat girl get tortured to that extent prior to cooking, it is not all that uncommon, either.&nbsp; That thought is all that is allowing me to keep my promise to you.&nbsp; You will be in terrible pain while I am 'processing' you, but there is a time limit in this contest.&nbsp; The whole process is limited to an hour."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What I mean," Carol said, "is that from the time I start, you will only have 60 minutes left of life." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Wow.&nbsp; That actually helps me a lot."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Really?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes," Jessica replied.&nbsp; "I was worried that I would be in unspeakable pain for three or four hours."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Nope," Charlie said as she came back outside.&nbsp; "You will not last that long.&nbsp; They did extend the time limit for the finals, but only by 30 minutes.&nbsp; So, instead of 60 minutes, your mom will have 90 minutes to kill you."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Still better than three hours."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That is true," Charlie replied.&nbsp; "Now, I am sorry to put a damper on things out here, but they are ready for us inside.&nbsp; Are you two ready?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Ready as I'll ever be," Jessica replied.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Um, yeah.&nbsp; Same here," Carol agreed quietly.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They turned and went into the building.

-----

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first thing Jessica noticed as they entered the processing floor was the stainless steel and white-tiled walls and floor.&nbsp; The stainless steel was everywhere.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It is easier to clean up this way," a young woman said as she approached.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I would imagine so," Carol said.&nbsp; "Just spray it down and you're ready for the next one."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You're not too far off," the woman said.&nbsp; "Hi.&nbsp; I'm Abby.&nbsp; I am the one who will walk you through the skinning process.&nbsp; You must be Carol and this must be Jessica."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes," Carol confirmed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Don't men work here, too," Jessica asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh yes," Abby replied.&nbsp; "For this, however, it was decided that only female employees would be here.&nbsp; The show's producers thought it might be easier for you.&nbsp; Well, you and the other girl."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh, yes," Carol said.&nbsp; "I thought they were going to be here.&nbsp; Where are they?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You will meet the mother tomorrow," Charlie said.&nbsp; "The producers felt it would be unfair if you knew how each other killed their daughters.&nbsp; This way, you will both go at the same time and they will broadcast the shows one after the other this evening."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Will that leave enough time to determine the winner," Jessica asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes.&nbsp; They will know by midnight, tonight.&nbsp; We, however - and by 'we', I mean your mother, the other mother, and me - will find out tomorrow at the barbecue."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hi, Carol," Shane said as she came up to the talking women.&nbsp; "That was a great show you put on for us last weekend."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Jesus, Shane," Charlie scolded.&nbsp; "Show some fucking compassion, won't you?&nbsp; You and I have no idea how hard it is for these women."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No. No, Charlie," Carol said.&nbsp; "It is okay.&nbsp; I understand her meaning."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Um, yeah," Shane said meekly.&nbsp; "But Charlie is right.&nbsp; I am not known for my tact.&nbsp; I am sorry if I offended."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Anyway," Shane continued, "to pour oil on this fire, it is time to start.&nbsp; Charlie has given us the rundown on what is going to happen.&nbsp; Where do you want to begin?"

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol looked at Jessica helplessly.&nbsp; Jessica smiled and pointed at the tray full of sharp cutlery.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"We will start by the tray near that drain," Carol said pointing to the drain in the floor.&nbsp; "I will need a stainless steel tray that has been sterilized for Jessica's breasts and pussy."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Got it," Shane said.&nbsp; "I will get it set up and we will begin in five minutes."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Okay, Carol," Abby said as she handed the mother an earpiece, "put this in and I will walk you through the skinning process when you get to that.&nbsp; It will take approximately 30 minutes to skin Jessica."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Damn," Jessica muttered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I know," Abby said.&nbsp; "My sister went that way five years ago at a family picnic.&nbsp; She was in tremendous pain and passed out four times."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh! Thanks for reminding me," Charlie said as she ran off to one of the technicians.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"How will you prevent me from bleeding to death," Jessica asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"We will use the same surgical sealant they use for live butchering.&nbsp; It will prevent bloodloss without affecting the flavor of your meat."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Here you go, Jessica," Charlie said as she appeared from nowhere and shoved a needle into the teenager's neck.&nbsp; "Had to get the stimulant.&nbsp; I know what we told you before, but they were able to find a stimulant that had an extremely mild anesthetic.&nbsp; You will still be in a lot of pain, but it will not be quite as bad as we had feared."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Anyway," Abby said, "as I was saying, it will take approximately 30 minutes to skin Jessica.&nbsp; It will take 5-10 minutes to cut off her breasts and pussy.&nbsp; That is 40 minutes.&nbsp; That will leave you almost an hour to boil her and cut off her head."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shane came back.&nbsp; She had set up the trays, one with a skinning knife and a butcher knife.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Okay," Shane said.&nbsp; "We are ready to begin when you are."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol looked at Jessica and the teenager nodded.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"We are ready," Carol said.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jessica took care in removing her clothes.&nbsp; As she took each article of clothing off, she folded it and set it in the chair by the door.&nbsp; A minute later, the 18-year-old was naked.&nbsp; Together, she and her mother walked to the table.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You may want to take your clothes off too, mom."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Damn," Carol said, cursing.&nbsp; "You are right."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol stripped down to the skin and approached her daughter.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Okay, Carol," Shane said.&nbsp; "We will not need a running dialogue like last week, but we would like you to introduce yourself and your daughter."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Okay," Carol replied.&nbsp; Give me a signal to let me know when the cameras are rolling."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Twenty second later, Shane gave the 'okay' gesture.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hello, folks," Carol said with a cheerfulness she didn't feel.&nbsp; "I am Carol and this is my daughter Jessica.&nbsp; We are going to be putting on a show for you.&nbsp; I am going to prepare her to be cooked."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hi," said Jessica.&nbsp; "I hope all you guys really like watching this.&nbsp; We will put on the best show we can as my mom kills me."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At a look from Jessica, signalling that she was ready, Carol picked up the butcher knife and tested its edge.&nbsp; The blade was incredibly sharp.&nbsp; Just as she put the blade to Jessica's left breast, Carol stopped and looked around.&nbsp; Something was missing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She walked over to another table on the other side of the room and retrieved the can of surgical sealant.&nbsp; She set the can on the table between the trays and picked up the knife again.&nbsp; Looking at Jessica again, she saw the teenager nod in appreciation of her mother remembering the sealant.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol place the blade under Jessica's left breast again and began cutting.&nbsp; Sawing slowly, Carol raised the blade until the left breast came off in her hand.&nbsp; She set the severed breast on the empty tray and used the sealant to stop the bleeding.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She repeated the process on Jessica's right breast and set the right breast next to the left on the tray.&nbsp; Again, she used the sealant to stop bleeding.&nbsp; Stepping back to give herself room, she dropped to her knees in front of her daughter's pussy.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A gasp from Jessica drew Carol's attention.&nbsp; The teenager was sobbing almost silently.&nbsp; Tears were running down the girl's cheeks.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I am sorry, Jessica," Carol said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No," the teenager said.&nbsp; "I know what you need to do, but I have a favor to ask.&nbsp; You can refuse if you want and I will not think less of you."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I would do anything for you," Carol said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"This is the last chance I am going to have," Jessica said.&nbsp; "Will you lick me?&nbsp; You know.....down there?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol knew exactly what Jessica was asking.&nbsp; This would be her last orgasm.&nbsp; Carol had not been with many women, but she did know how to do what the 18-year-old wanted.&nbsp; Rising to her feet, Carol helped Jessica to sit on the edge of the table.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lowering her face to the girl's pussy, Carol started with slow, careful licks along the slit.&nbsp; After a few moments, it opened up and the lips becam engorged.&nbsp; Licking more forcefully, Carol drove her tongue into her daughters vagina.&nbsp; The nectar was sweet.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Returning to the outer lips, Carol began the long licks going from the perineum to the clitoris.&nbsp; She smiled slightly as she could see and smell the girl becoming more aroused.&nbsp; The scent was maddeningly erotic.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol raised her left hand and slid the index finger into her daughter's vagina.&nbsp; The girl was becoming very wet with desire.&nbsp; Focusing her tongue action on the 18-year-old's clitoris, Carol probed the front of Jessica's vagina with her index finger.&nbsp; Finding the g-spot made the girl jump, almost causing her mother to bite the clitoris clean off.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh, god," Jessica moaned.&nbsp; "Yes.&nbsp; Right there.&nbsp; Just like that.&nbsp; Oh, godddd, yes."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The 18-year-old was quick to arouse and quick to reach orgasm.&nbsp; Mere moments after Carol the girl's g-spot, Jessica flooded her mother's face with cum.&nbsp; While Jessica reveled in the pleasure caused by her mother's oral ministrations, Carol pointedly looked at Abby and directed her eyes to a clock.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Abby understood the question.&nbsp; Looking at her watch, the technician saw that 15 minutes had passed.&nbsp; They still had 75 minutes.&nbsp; That was enough time for Carol to pleasure her daughter once more.&nbsp; Looking back at the pleading mother, Abby nodded with a smile.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That was all Carol needed.&nbsp; As she lowered her head to her daughter's crotch again, Carol slid another finger inside the 18-year-old's vagina.&nbsp; Jessica's body responded favorably.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh, mom," Jessica asked, "oh, mom, what are you doing?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hush, dear," Carol said as she cried silent tears, "just enjoy this and try to keep this good feeling as long as you can."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol redoubled her efforts on her daughter's clitoris; sucking it, nibbling it, and rolling it around with her tongue.&nbsp; While her tongue was busy, the mother's fingers were equally busy.&nbsp; Two fingers were massaging the girl's g-spot, occasionally leaving that to stroke the cervix, eliciting a moan of pleasure.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Replacing her left hand with her right hand, Carol inserted her slick index finger into her daughter's anus.&nbsp; As Carol expected, the 18-year-old's breathing became very ragged as she approached a mindblowing orgasm.&nbsp; The girl obviously liked the anal stimulation.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh, god," Jessica said. "Oh, god. Oh, god. Oh, god. That feels so good, mom.&nbsp; How did you know I would feel this good?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hush, Jessica.&nbsp; Just enjoy it.&nbsp; That is all mommy wants.&nbsp; I just want you to enjoy this sensation."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh, god, mom.&nbsp; This is the best.&nbsp; I cannot believe that I let my boyfriend get away without making me feel this good.&nbsp; I am going to cum.&nbsp; I'm going to cum, mom.&nbsp; Oh, god.&nbsp; I am going to cummmmm....."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jessica exploded into another orgasm.&nbsp; This one was much stronger than the first.&nbsp; She never knew sex could be so good.&nbsp; Those bastards she dated had known nothing.&nbsp; This was the best.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Seeing Jessica lost in the pleasure of her orgasm, Carol quickly went back to work.&nbsp; She wanted Jessica to be dazed in pleasure ans she lost her pussy.&nbsp; Four quick cuts - one across the mound, one down each side, and one connecting the side ones near the perineum - and a quick strong yank later, and Jessica's pussy had joined her breasts on the stainless steel tray.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jessica had felt her pussy go, but, lost in the sensations of her orgasm, the pain was like it belonged to someone else.&nbsp; It was felt, but it just did not seem that important.&nbsp; As the euphoria from the orgasm subsided, she felt the coldness from the sealant as her mother stopped the bleeding.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Thank you, mom," Jessica said.&nbsp; "I was not sure I was going to be able to handle that part."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, it seemed best to do it while you were out of it.&nbsp; You will be in more than enough pain from now on."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I know," the 18-year-old said with a shudder as she remembered what came next.&nbsp; "I am ready whenever you are."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That is my cue," Abby said through the earpiece.&nbsp; "Okay, Carol have Jessica stand up.&nbsp; We are going to have to move fast through this first part."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At her mother's gesture, Jessica rost to her feet.&nbsp; Looking down, she saw the gaping hole where her womanhood had been mere minutes before.&nbsp; More tears started to flow.&nbsp; Never again.&nbsp; Never again would she feel the pleasure her mother had just given her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Okay," Abby said.&nbsp; "Before you start cutting listen to me.&nbsp; Grab that bottle of oil on the shelf and start rubbing it all over Jessica's body.&nbsp; Start at the neck and work your way down.&nbsp; It will sting when it hits the exposed tissue on her chest and crotch, but it will prevent ripping or stretching as you remove the skin."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol got the oil and did as she was told.&nbsp; Starting at the neck, she gave her daughter a complete rubdown with the oil.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Good," Abby said.&nbsp; "In a moment, we will make out first cut.&nbsp; It will be a shallow cut - about a quarter-inch deep - all around her neck.&nbsp; The second cut - also a quarter-inch deep - will go from the base of her spine to the circle you cut around her neck."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Once those cuts are made, pull the corner flaps out and down away from the base of her neck.&nbsp; Use the skinning knife to separate any tissue clinging to the inside of the skin.&nbsp; Go slowly and carefully as you lift and separate the skin from her back.&nbsp; Use the sealant on the exposed tissue to stop any bleeding."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol finished with the oil and picked up the skinning knife.&nbsp; She looked at Jessica and, with a wink, the 18-year-old lifted her hair out of the way, bared her neck and nodded, indicating she was ready.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol made the first cut carefully. As she finished the circular cut, Jessica moaned in pain, but motioned for her mother to continue.&nbsp; Carol inserted the tip of the blade one quarter-inch deep into the skin at the base of Jessica's spine.&nbsp; With a deep breath, the mother drew the blade straight up, carefully monitoring the depth of the cut, until the knife met the circular cut.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carefully using the tip of the knife, Carol lifted up one corner of skin and slowly pulled out and down, exposing the clinging tissues beneath.&nbsp; Carol used the skinning knife to cut through these tissues and continued pulling the skin from her daughter's back.&nbsp; When she had exposed the tissue from the middle of Jessica's back to her right side and down to her waist, Carol used the sealant to stop the bleeding.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Picking up the knife again, Carol did the same to the left side.&nbsp; Pulling the corner away and down, she exposed the remaining tissue on Jessica's back and used the sealant to stop any bleeding.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Excellent work, so far," Abby said.&nbsp; "Now comes the hard part.&nbsp; Use the knife to free the skin from Jessica's shoulders and upper arms.&nbsp; As you do this, you will also need to separate it from her chest.&nbsp; Be careful as you do that.&nbsp; There are a lot of nerves there."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By this time, Jessica was sobbing in pain.&nbsp; She was not quite screaming, but it was close.&nbsp; Tears continued to roll down Carol's cheeks as she inserted the skinning knife under the skin of her daughter's shoulders and cut through the clinging tissue.&nbsp; Soon, both shoulders were exposed and the mother used the sealant to stop the bleeding again.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I am sorry, Jessie," Carol said as she stepped in front of her daughter.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I know, mom," Jessica sobbed.&nbsp; "It is not going to last too much longer so just continue.&nbsp; It is already too late to stop."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol grit her teeth and pulled the skin from the shoulders around and down the front of the 18-year-old's chest.&nbsp; Jessica howled, the pain getting too great to bear quietly.&nbsp; Carol used the skinning knife to separate the skin from Jessica's upper body.&nbsp; It became difficult as the skin on the arms prevented too much progress.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Okay, Carol," Abby said through the earpiece, "now we need to do the arms.&nbsp; Like you did with the neck, cut a shallow circle around the Jessica's wrists.&nbsp; Be careful not to cut any of the major veins.&nbsp; Have the sealant handy just in case.&nbsp; That will take care of any bleeding on the off chance that you do cut a vein."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol went to her daughter's left side and cut the circle around the wrist.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Now, because this can be tricky," Abby continued, "we are going to make it a bit easier.&nbsp; Go up to her upper arm where the skin is loosened already.&nbsp; Cut a circle around the arm there.&nbsp; Then, cut a line connecting the two circles.&nbsp; Once done, grab the loosened skin near the shoulder and pull.&nbsp; The skin should come off easily."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol followed the instructions and soon, the skin from Jessica's left arm was on the tray with her breasts and pussy.&nbsp; An unknown woman brought in a medical transportation container and put the skin in that, leaving the container for Carol to use for the rest of the 18-year-old's skin.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol used the sealant again and then repeated the process on Jessica's right arm.&nbsp; Knowing what she was doing now, helped out tremendously.&nbsp; In a matter of minutes, the skin from the girl's right arm joined the skin from the left.&nbsp; With the arms stripped, the skin from Jessica's upper body fell loosely until it was caught by the clinging tissue near her ribs.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Perhaps," Abby said, "now would be the best time to do her legs.&nbsp; It is the same procedure you used on the arms, but because that skin is not already loosened, you will need to pry it up like you did with the skin around her neck.&nbsp; Go carefully.&nbsp; You will be cutting near the femoral artery and if you cut that, the sealant may not be enough to stop the bleeding.&nbsp; It will be protected by surrounding muscles so you won't have to worry too much, just be careful.&nbsp; She is not restrained and may kick reflexively."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol understood and was tempted to 'slip'.&nbsp; Doing so, however would cost them the contest and make Jessica's sacrifice meaningless.&nbsp; Carol couldn't do it.&nbsp; As much as she loved her daughter and hated causing pain to the 18-year-old, she had to continue.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The mother followed the pattern used on the arms and soon the legs' skin joined the other skin in the container.&nbsp; There had been a moment when, as Abby had warned, Jessica's leg kicked out, knocking Carol to the floor.&nbsp; Because of Abby's warning, however, Carol had been careful and did not cut any major arteries.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm sorry," Jessica sobbed.&nbsp; "I'm sorry, mom.&nbsp; I couldn't help it.&nbsp; Are you okay?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I am okay, Jessie," Carol said as she rose to her feet.&nbsp; "I knew that could happen.&nbsp; It is fine."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm so sorry, mom.&nbsp; This hurts so bad.&nbsp; It is far worse than I had imagined."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It is okay Jessie.&nbsp; It will be over soon.&nbsp; Can you continue?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Do I have a choice," Jessica asked sardonically, regretting it instantly as she saw the hurt reaction on her mother's face.&nbsp; "I'm sorry, mom.&nbsp; Yes; I can continue."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol returned her attention to her daughter's chest and carefully freed the skin from the clinging tissues there.&nbsp; As she did so, the skin fell loosely until all that held it on the 18-year-old were the tissues around the girls buttocks and hips.&nbsp; After three more minutes, those had been cut free and the skin fell to the floor. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Again, Carol used the sealant to stop the bleeding.&nbsp; She picked up the skin and put it into the container.&nbsp; The unnamed woman retrieved the container and disappeared again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jessica stood there, sobbing quietly.&nbsp; The pain was dulling.&nbsp; There must have been some anesthetic in the sealant.&nbsp; She couldn't remember if anyone said there was but she could not think of another reason the pain was easing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"We are almost done, Jessie," Carol said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I know.&nbsp; It is time for my bath, right?"

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol cracked a smile at Jessica's joke as they walked over to the clear glass pot.&nbsp; It had been placed on a burner that slid out from the base of a stove in the plant's kitchen.&nbsp; The burning surface was 36 inches across and the pot covered all of it.&nbsp; Someone had brought a stepladder over to help Jessica climb into the pot.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The water was warm, but not hot.&nbsp; They would raise the temperature gradually.&nbsp; This would prevent more undue pain and let heat stroke kill the girl.&nbsp; It was a strategy used for years by the more humane cooks and Carol appreciated the thought.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Okay, Carol," Abby said.&nbsp; "You have 50 minutes left.&nbsp; The burner is programmed to increase the temperature at a steady pace.&nbsp; It should be hot enough to kill Jessica in about 40 minutes.&nbsp; That would leave you 10 minutes to remove her head and finish up."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Jessie," Carol said.&nbsp; "Abby says that you have about 40 minutes left.&nbsp; At that point, the water will be hot enough to kill you.&nbsp; Is there anything I can do for you?&nbsp; Is there anything you want?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I have about 40 minutes left?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I think I would like to know how I taste."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What do you mean?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Would they let you cook up my pussy and breasts and let me eat them as I cook?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Wow," Abby said, hearing everything.&nbsp; "This girl really knows how to put on a show.&nbsp; We can bring in a portable grill and have it ready in five minutes.&nbsp; If you would like."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"They," Carol said to Jessica after nodding to Abby, "are bringing in a portable grill.&nbsp; They thought your last meal would be a great addition to the show."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Good."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jessica sat in the pot, watching as the technicians wheeled in the grill.&nbsp; Although the water's temperature was rising, it was still comfortable.&nbsp; The pain she expected by having her raw muscles exposed to the hot water was almot non-existant. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol went over to the grill, taking the tray with her.&nbsp; She set one of the breasts on the grill and winced as it hissed and spit.&nbsp; At least Jessica would not have to deal with the physical pain of having her breasts grilled.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The smell permeated the room.&nbsp; It was mouth-watering.&nbsp; Carol felt a little ill when she realized that she would like a taste, too.&nbsp; This was her daughter.&nbsp; It was understandable that Jessica would want to know how she tasted.&nbsp; Carol did not like that she also wanted to know how the teenager tasted.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first breast was done and Carol took it off the grill.&nbsp; The grill was too small to cook more than one item at a time.&nbsp; It was, she realized, a good way to fill in the time.&nbsp; She could see the cameras zooming in for a close-up of the grill and Jessica's cooking parts.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jessica sat in the pot watching her mother cook the breasts.&nbsp; The first was done and the second was almost done as well.&nbsp; In Jessica's opinion, her mother was doing great.&nbsp; The teenager knew this had to be incredibly difficult for the older woman, but Carol was pulling it off.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"One more to go," Carol called over her shoulder to Jessica as she took the second breast off the grill and put the pussy on to cook.&nbsp; "Do you want them as they are, or would you like some barbecue sauce on them?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I would like them as they are," Jessica said.&nbsp; "I don't want the sauce to hide the natural taste."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I can't say that I blame you.&nbsp; They smell wonderful."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A few minutes later, Carol came over to the pot and was surprised.&nbsp; Steam was beginning to rise from the surface of the water.&nbsp; Dipping a finger in the water, she found the water was almost too hot for her finger.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It's getting a bit warm in here," Jessica said jokingly. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I bet it is," Carol agreed.&nbsp; "Anyway, here is your meal.&nbsp; I will cut it for you.&nbsp; What would you like to try first?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That's a no-brainer.&nbsp; I want to try my pussy.&nbsp; My boyfriend used to say it tasted great.&nbsp; Now I get to find out for myself."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol cut a piece off and placed it in Jessica's mouth.&nbsp; The girl chewed thoughtfully for a moment before she broke into a huge grin.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"This is awesome.&nbsp; You have to try it, mom."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh," Carol objected, "I couldn't.&nbsp; This is your meal."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Nonsense.&nbsp; I am not going to be able to eat it all.&nbsp; You have to have some with me."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol acquiesced and cut off a small piece for herself.&nbsp; Biting into the small morsel, she found herself amazed.&nbsp; She had had female meat before (who hadn't), but this was better than any she had ever tried.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"This is good," Carol said.&nbsp; "It's the best I've ever had.&nbsp; You were right not to spoil it with barbecue sauce."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I think so too," Jessica said as she suddenly found it harder to breathe.&nbsp; "Woah, I think I am getting close to the end."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol looked at Abby.&nbsp; The woman checked the clock and the temperature readout on the computer terminal that controlled the rising temperature.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It is getting close," Abby said.&nbsp; "She has maybe five minute less before her heart gives out.&nbsp; That will give you almost 20 minutes to finish up."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Abby says you have about five minute left," Carol said as tears again began rolling down her cheeks.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It is okay, mom," Jessica said slowly.&nbsp; "I knew it was going to be like this.&nbsp; Let's be quick, though.&nbsp; I still want to have some of my breast meat while I am still conscious enough to enjoy it."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol complied, cutting one of the cooked breasts into five slices.&nbsp; She put one of the slices into Jessica's mouth and the 18-year-old chewed thoughtfully.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It is not as good as the pussy," Jessica said, "but it is ok.&nbsp; Now those would be better with barbecue sauce.&nbsp; Forget them and let me finish my pussy."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol smiled at her daughter as she cut the pussy into four pieces.&nbsp; She fed the pieces, one-by-one, to her daughter, who chewed them thoroughly and swallowed them with pleasure.&nbsp; Jessica really liked the taste of her pussy.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Delicious," Jessica said slowly, her head beginning to hang down a little as lost the strength to keep it up.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol held her daughter's head lovingly, trying to ignore the heat radiating through the skin.&nbsp; Jessica's eyes were glazing over, the girl losing the ability to see.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Mom," Jessica asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, Jessie," Carol replied as tears fell from her face into the almost boiling water.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Thank you for going along....along with this.&nbsp; It is the best thing, after all.&nbsp; My sisters will be better offffff...."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jessica went limp as her heart gave out and she died.&nbsp; Carol wept openly.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Okay," Charlie said through the earpiece.&nbsp; "I hate to push you, but we do have to continue.&nbsp; Jessica was adamant on this point."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No," Carol said, wiping the tears from her eyes.&nbsp; "You are right.&nbsp; She made me promise too."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suddenly, two meat hooks lowered from the ceiling.&nbsp; Carol had not even noticed them before this.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"There are heat resistant gloves in the drawer of the table," Abby said.&nbsp; "You will need them.&nbsp; You will need to push the hooks through Jessica's chest and use the winch to lift her from the pot.&nbsp; She is just too hot to handle any other way."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"When she is hanging from the hooks," Abby continued, "you can move her to the table and use the winch to lower her.&nbsp; Leave the hooks in.&nbsp; You will need them to move her body back to the pot once her head is removed."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol did as instructed.&nbsp; She found it easier than she had thought it would be.&nbsp; The fact that Jessica was already dead and could not feel what was happening to her made it much better for Carol.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Jessica's body was laid out on the table, the hooks protruding obscenely like steel nipples from where the girl's breasts should have been, Carol picked up the axe left for the job and removed Jessica's head with one clean strike.&nbsp; Two minutes later, the headless body was back in the pot and Abby was turning up the heat.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol sat on the table, the residual heat left from her daughter's cooked body heating her buttocks.&nbsp; In her arms, Carol held the head of her daughter as she wept uncontrollably.&nbsp; It was over.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And......were done," Shane said as they finished filming by getting a close-up of the mother holding her daughter's severed head.&nbsp; "Good job, everybody."

-----

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol was still sitting on the table ten minutes later when Charlie appeared with her clothes.&nbsp; Charlie sat on the tale beside her and put her arm around the distraught woman's shoulders.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"This was so much worse than last week," Carol said quietly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I know," Charlie replied.&nbsp; "I am sorry.&nbsp; Keep in mind, though, that this was all Jessica's idea.&nbsp; She told me she had a fantasy of being boiled as soup, but never really thought she would be brave enough to go through with it."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Really?&nbsp; She never said anything to me about it."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Would you be able to tell you mother something like that?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Good point."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Anyway, she felt that this was a good way of indulging in her fantasy.&nbsp; It served two purposes.&nbsp; To fulfill a fantasy and better the chances of of mother winning this contest."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And the skinning part?&nbsp; Was that her idea too?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Actually, it was.&nbsp; She was not as sure about that as she was about the boiling, but she thought it would make for a great show.&nbsp; I guess we will have to wait and see.&nbsp; We will know tomorrow, for sure."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"About tomorrow," Carol said hesitantly, "I do not think I can kill either of those two women.&nbsp; I am furious with them both, but I....I just cannot do it myself."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I understand," Charlie replied.&nbsp; "The other finalist feels the same way you do.&nbsp; The producers have come up with an alternative.&nbsp; The two oldest daughters of the fraudulent contestant will kill the neighbor and the daughter of the neighbor will kill the contestant.&nbsp; The girl thinks of it as justice for the contestant killing her sister."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That makes sense," Carol said.&nbsp; "Thank you for understanding."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No problem.&nbsp; Now, not to be indelicate, but, put that down.&nbsp; You need to get dressed and I really don't think you need to take that with you when we leave."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol looked at her daughter's severed head.&nbsp; There was a kind of peaceful smile on the face.&nbsp; Kissing Jessica's lips one last time, Carol put the head down and moved to retrieve her clothes.&nbsp; She stopped herself just before she picked them up.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I should probably take a shower, first," Carol said, noticing she was covered in blood.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I think that would be a wonderful idea.&nbsp; Shane told me where the washroom is.&nbsp; Come with me."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The two went to the washroom and Charlie stripped down, joining Carol under the hot spray from the shower.&nbsp; She scrubbed Carol's back, and washed the mother's hair.&nbsp; Then she went around in front of Carol and washed the woman's front.&nbsp; When Carol was all rinsed off, Charlie sunk to her knees and buried her face into Carol's crotch.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Charlie," Carol asked, "what are you doing?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Something that needs to be done," Charlie replied as she pulled Carol to the floor.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charlie spread Carol's legs, exposing the older woman's pussy.&nbsp; Licking her lips, Charlie dove in.&nbsp; She licked the outer lips and used her fingers to massage Carol's thighs.&nbsp; She wanted Carol relaxed for this.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Ohhhhhh," Carol moaned.&nbsp; "That feels good, but we shouldn't.&nbsp; Not now, of all times."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Especially now.&nbsp; You need to feel good.&nbsp; You are doing the same thing you did last week after Kimberly's show.&nbsp; Jessica would be infuriated at you for feeling bad about this.&nbsp; This is what she decided and what she wanted."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You know," Charlie continued," and I know damn well that Jessica would not want you to beat yourself up over this.&nbsp; You would want, if at all possible, you to feel good.&nbsp; I intend to see that it is."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charlie ignored further protests and drove her tongue up into Carol's vagina.&nbsp; Carol tensed up and squealed when Charlie slid a finger up her anus.&nbsp; The womanly juices that suddenly flooded Charlie's face, however, proved that the invading digit was not an unwelcome visitor.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charlie continued with her manipulation of Carol's body, moving her tongue to the older woman's clitoris as Charlie's slid two other fingers into the convulsing woman's pussy.&nbsp; Stroking the front of the vagina, Charlie quickly found Carol's g-spot and used it masterfully to drive Carol into one orgasm after another.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An hour and six orgasms later, Carol passed out.&nbsp; Charlie rinsed and dried the unconscious woman and somehow managed to get her dressed.&nbsp; Then Charlie dressed herself.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Was that really the best way to handle that," Shane asked from the doorway.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I think so.&nbsp; You did not see it, but she was really tore up after last weekend.&nbsp; Losing Kimberly that way and facing the serious probability that she would lose Jessica this week, Carol fell into a downward spiral of self condemnation and hate."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"We - Jessica and I, that is - were able to get her through it, but we figured that something like this would help forestall that vicious cycle this time.&nbsp; The trick is to keep her too tired to think."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What are you going to do tonight, though," Shane asked. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, Jim and I are very open sexually.&nbsp; If necessary, I will have him fuck the living shit out of her and keep her exhausted."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shane snorted laughter and walked away.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"HEY," Charlie shouted.&nbsp; "Don't leave.&nbsp; I need help getting her to the car.&nbsp; She is really out of it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yeah," Shane replied as she came back.&nbsp; "I wonder why.&nbsp; I guess multiple orgasms will do that to you.&nbsp; Where did you learn to do that, anyway.&nbsp; I thought you were straight."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No such thing," Charlie replied with a smile.&nbsp; "Anyway, I learned it at girlscout camp."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shane laughed again as they carried Carol out to Charlie's car.

----------

Sunday

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol woke from a troubled sleep on Sunday morning. Looking at the clock, she cursed under her breath as she saw it was 7:15. It was time to get up and make breakfast for the three little girls. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rolling to her left, Carol bumped into someone.&nbsp; Wiping her eyes, she saw it was Charlie, completely naked. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Damn," Carol muttered.&nbsp; "What did I do last night?"

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol rolled to her right and bumped into another person.&nbsp; This time, it was Jim, Charlie's husband; also completely naked.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"WHAT THE HELL," Carol exclaimed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hey," Jim said sleepily, "keep it down.&nbsp; We don't want to wake the little girls."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yeah," Charlie said as she woke up and snaked an arm around Carol, causing the older woman to realize - for the first time - that she was also completely naked.&nbsp; "Keep it down."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What the hell happened, last night," Carol asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, Jim and I found this really hot older lady and she gave us the best night of sex we ever had.&nbsp; Right, honey?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Damn right," Jim agreed with a smile on his face.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Anyway," he continued as he rose from the bed, exposing his giant cock to Carol, "who's hungry?&nbsp; I'm cooking."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oooh, you're in for a treat, Carol," Charlie said.&nbsp; "Jim is an awesome cook."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Charlie," Carol began, "about last night...."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No, sweetie.&nbsp; Don't worry about last night.&nbsp; Jim and I knew that this would be hard on you and we agreed that you should stay here for a while.&nbsp; The girls can get to school as easily from here as they can from your house.&nbsp; Take things slow and, when you are really ready, then, go home."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But the sex....."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The sex is fun.&nbsp; That is all.&nbsp; Jim and I are very open and honest with each other.&nbsp; When I told him about our fun in the shower yesterday, he admitted to having a deep attraction to you.&nbsp; After the girls went to bed, we all came in here.&nbsp; If you don't remember, we filmed it.&nbsp; You can watch the film later."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol blushed, but nodded.&nbsp; She would like to see what happened the night before.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What now?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well," Charlie said, "it is almost 8:00.&nbsp; We need to be at Columbia Park at 11:00.&nbsp; We won't need to leave before 10:00, so we have a little over two hours.&nbsp; It will take Jim at least 40 minutes to prepare breakfast, so we have time....."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What are you planning?&nbsp; What about the girls?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The girls will be fine.&nbsp; Jim can keep an eye on them until we come downstairs.&nbsp; As for what I am planning.......well, let's see."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charlie drew her forefinger lightly up Carol's leg, tickling the older woman as she went.&nbsp; Carol started to object, but Charlie forestalled any comments by covering Carol's mouth with her own.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Jim is not the only one who has a deep attraction to you," Charlie said.&nbsp; "We would really like it if you would consider moving in with us."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But what if I lose?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh," Charlie replied as she kissed Carol's nipple, sending shocks of pleasure shooting through the older woman, "I do not think that is likely.&nbsp; But, even on the off chance that you do lose, this will allow the girls time to get use to us."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol couldn't argue with that logic.&nbsp; Just as she thought she might have a valid argument, it was banished as Charlie did something that brought a tremendous amount of pleasure, distracting her from the argument.&nbsp; Giving in, she realized that living with Charlie and Jim would probably be a good thing.&nbsp; There were too many reminders of Kimberly and Jessica at the house.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After another mindblowing orgasm, brought on by Charlies talented hands and tongue, Charlie hustled Carol into the bathroom for a quick, shared shower before breakfast.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But what about you," Carol asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Not to worry," Charlie replied with a smile.&nbsp; "You and Jim worked me over good last night.&nbsp; I am still a little too sore - in a good way, mind you - to be too interested in getting off myself.&nbsp; Now, let's get cleaned up.&nbsp; We have a nice breakfast waiting for us."

-----

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charlie was right.&nbsp; Jim was an awesome cook.&nbsp; Sure it was normal breakfast fare (steak, eggs, homestyle potatoes, toast, and orange juice), but the flavor was amazing.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Jim," Carol said with a smile, "this is amazing.&nbsp; Charlie was right.&nbsp; Your cooking is wonderful."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, I was trained at Le Chat's when I was younger," Jim replied, naming a 5-Star restaurant in New York City.&nbsp; "I like to cook so I do whenever possible."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Which is at least 4 days a week," Charlie added.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The conversation ended with the arrival of the three little girls.&nbsp; They were excited.&nbsp; They had had a wonderful time with Jim the day before and were looking forward to another fun-filled day.&nbsp; The three adults and three children talked pleasantly as they ate and at 9:45, Charlie reminded Carol they had to get ready to go.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The two women went up to the bedroom and got dressed.&nbsp; Carol was nervous.&nbsp; Actually, she was terrified.&nbsp; This was like waiting for the results of an extremely important test.&nbsp; Only, these results carried a lot more weight.&nbsp; If she passed, the efforts of the last two weeks had meaning.&nbsp; If she failed, well......better not to think that way.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"C'mon, Carol," Charlie said.&nbsp; "We have to go."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The two went downstairs, got in the car, and left for the park.

-----

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I talked with Shane last night," Charlie said.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They had been driving for 30 minutes and, according to Charlie, they still had another 25-30 minutes until they reached the park.&nbsp; Carol had ridden in silence to this point and Charlie, sensing another bout of self-condemnation, decided to force a conversation.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh?&nbsp; What did she say?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"She said that the producers would have the two criminals executed by the surviving daughters before the results of the finals are announced.&nbsp; They - the producers - that is, felt that you two finalists who made real sacrifices should see that the producers honor your sacrifices 
and will harshly punish anyone who makes a mockery of such sacrifices."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yeah, cause that is what we really need," Carol said sardonically.&nbsp; "More killing to make us feel better."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It is funny.&nbsp; That was the argument against it that Shane brought up.&nbsp; She was overruled, though.&nbsp; The producers seem to think it will be an important lesson.&nbsp; Apparently, they are lobbying to make this an annual contest."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Do you have any idea how the other finalist did?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Not a clue," Charlie answered.&nbsp; "Shane does, but she was forbidden from telling us.&nbsp; They will fire her if she says anything.&nbsp; And, I mean that literally.&nbsp; They will cook her ass.&nbsp; So, she is not saying a fucking word."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Cannot say as I blame her."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Wow," Charlie said as the entrance to the park came into view.&nbsp; "We were much closer than I remembered.&nbsp; We are here."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There were four tables - 10' long each - set in a semi-circle around a low stage.&nbsp; Each table could seat six or seven people comfortably.&nbsp; There were two objects on the stage, both covered with heavy tarpaulins.&nbsp; Between the two objects, was a podium with a microphone.&nbsp; A fifth table, much smaller, sat behind -and between - the two middle tables.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol, Charlie, and the crew that filmed Jessica's death - including Shane - were seated at the table to the far right.&nbsp; The other finalist and the crew who filmed her daughter's death were seated at the table to the far left.&nbsp; The middle tables were reserved for the program producers and members of the State Meat Processing Board.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By 11:05, all the seats were occupied.&nbsp; The fifth table had five occupants; the two criminals (Theresa Carst and Melanie Killigan) and the three daughters (Emily Carst, Ailene Carst, and Serena Killigan) that would be killing them.&nbsp; Everyone's attention, however was drawn to the young woman - in her early twenties - that approached the podium.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen," the woman said.&nbsp; "My name is Karen Alchrist.&nbsp; Thank you for coming.&nbsp; I know Ms. Carol McNeely to my left and Ms. Louise Rand are anxious to know the results of their labors yesterday, but we do have some business to take care of first.&nbsp; Would the ladies from table five please bring Ms. Killigan and Ms. Carst up to the stage?"

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The three daughters all but hauled the struggling criminals to the stage.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"For those of you who do not know, Ms. Rand ranked first in the first round and Ms. McNeely placed third.&nbsp; That is not to say Ms. McNeely's performance was bad.&nbsp; On the contrary, it was spectacular.&nbsp; It just was not as well received as our guest entertainer's perfomance."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"A problem arose, however, when we were informed that the Ms. Carst had murdered a girl unrelated to her.&nbsp; In her first-round perfomance, Theresa Carst killed Tamara Killigan while pretending that Tamara was her own daughter.&nbsp; We later found out that Tamara, like the planned victim for the final round, Serena Killigan, was only 16 years old."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The biggest shock, however, came when we learned that it was all done with the agreement from Tamara's mother, Melanie Killigan.&nbsp; Ms. Killigan had sold her two underage daughters so her friend could live."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The courts heard our case and cleared us of all wrongdoing and gave us the right to dispose of these two trecherous mothers as we pleased.&nbsp; What pleased us was to let the finalists take care of them.&nbsp; In a generous gesture, the finalists allowed that priviledge to fall to the wronged daughters.&nbsp; I am happy to present Emily and Ailene Carst and Serena Killigan."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Thank you, Karen," Emily said.&nbsp; "First, I want to offer a heartfelt apology to Serena, who lost her sister because of the actions of our mothers.&nbsp; Serena will be moving in with us and will become a paert of our family."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I am sure that you are wondering about these," Emily said as she gestured to the covered objects on the stage.&nbsp; "Well, we thought this would be appropriate."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With that, two assistants removed the tarps, revealing an an electric grinder and a vertical spit.&nbsp; Behind the spit, the attendants quickly erected a scaffold that had a hoop welded onto it.&nbsp; Beside the spit - one on each side - were to big blocks of ice. On top of each block was a wooden platform.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What you see," Emily said, "are the two methods of execution we will use.&nbsp; A coin toss earlier decided that Serena's mother, Melanie, will go into the grinder.&nbsp; My mother, Theresa, will take the spit."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The spit rig is kinda complicated, but not really.&nbsp; A rope will pass through the hoop on the scaffold and will be keep my mother's hands bound above her head.&nbsp; The other end of the rope will be attached to a 50-pound weight.&nbsp; My mother will stand on the two wooden platforms and will sink onto the spit as the ice melts."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"To add to the torture, the spit will rise one inch every 90 seconds.&nbsp; In two hours, it will be at its full height of seven feet.&nbsp; In addition, the spit is electrified and will release its charge every 45 seconds, electrocuting whoever it is piercing.&nbsp; The electrical discharge will not kill the victim, but it will caus tremendous pain."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Wow," Carol whispered to Charlie.&nbsp; "Remind me to never piss her off."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Tell me about it."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Receiving a nod from the producers, Emily, Ailene, and Serena ripped Melanie's clothes from her body.&nbsp; The older woman struggled mightily and it took all three to shove the naked woman into the grinder and close the clear, heavy-duty plastic door.&nbsp; Serena attached a hose to the top of the grinder and plugged in the grinder.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The hose I attached," Serena said as she returned to the podium, "is attached to a sprayer that will continually rinse the blood off the clear door so we can watch as my mother is ground up.&nbsp; I will hold off on starting the grinder until Ms. Carst is in position."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The three daughters then manhandled Theresa onto the blocks.&nbsp; Unseen by the audience until now were the manacles bolted to the stage on the outside of the ice blocks.&nbsp; With the three daughters holding Theresa in place as the older woman struggled and cursed, the assistants secured the manacles to Theresa's ankles.&nbsp; The assistants then bound Theresa's wrists and fed the rope through the hoop on the scaffold before tying it to the 50-pound weight.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Thank you, gentlemen," Emily said as the assistants finished securing the rope to the weight.&nbsp; "We are now ready to begin.&nbsp; Serena?&nbsp; Whenever you are ready."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Thank you, Emily," Serena said as she flicked the switch, starting the grinder.&nbsp; "Goodbye, mother."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Melanie howled in terror from within the confines of her plastic cage.&nbsp; The grinding rollers began to spin and water began to spray down on her.&nbsp; This was not supposed to happen.&nbsp; Theresa had promised that no one would ever find out.&nbsp; How could this happen to her?&nbsp; For fuck's sake, she was only 32 years old.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The screams of terror quickly turned into screams of pain as the grinders bit into the flesh of Melanie's foot and dragged the leg in, pulping it and turning it to fine hamburger.&nbsp; The bones were ground into powder and, as such, would pose no choking hazard; not that any human would eat this meat.&nbsp; Serena and the producers agreed to send this meat to a dogfood company. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The sprayer worked great.&nbsp; The flow of water kept the door clean and allowed the audience to watch in fascination as, bit-by-bit, Melanie disappeared into the grinding mechanism.&nbsp; Her screams were drowned out by the whine of the machinery.&nbsp; In a matter of five minutes, Melanie was gone and the spray had washed all the blood and gore from the grinding mechanism.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Serena turned off the grinder and unplugged it.&nbsp; Opening the drawer beneath the grinding rollers, she showed the mass of hamburger meat to the audience.&nbsp; As the audience applauded, Serena spproached the podium.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Thank you," Serena said as the applause died down.&nbsp; "I am sorry if you wanted to eat that, but I felt that her meat was worthless for anything other than dogfood so it was sold off to a dogfood supplier."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No one seemed to mind and, with another wave and a word of thanks, Serena returned to her table.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well," Emily said as she returned to the podium, "that was sure entertaining.&nbsp; What do you think, mother?"

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Theresa only glared at her eldest daughter.&nbsp; The foolish child was mocking her.&nbsp; Here, all Theresa had been trying to do was to extend her life and her children turned on her.&nbsp; It was completely unbelievable how ungrateful those brats were.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I guess the cat's got her tongue," Emily said with a smile.&nbsp; "Oh, well.&nbsp; Time is moving on, as they say, and we must as well.&nbsp; Goodbye, mother."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Emily pushed a button on a remote and the audience watched as the spit rose from the stage and inserted the first six inches into Theresa's pussy.&nbsp; Forty-five seconds later, Theresa let out a shriek as the first electrical discharge raced through her body.&nbsp; Smiling, Emily returned to her table, joining Ailene and Serena as they watched the show.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Thank you, girls," Karen said as she returned to the podium.&nbsp; "That was very entertaining and I am sure Theresa will provide even more entertainment before she is done."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, as Emily said, it is time to move on.&nbsp; We will now announce the winner of the contest.&nbsp; As for the loser, we will have the bodies of their daughters auctioned off.&nbsp; As both contestants have small children - and have made the necessary arrangements for their children should they lose this contest - the money from the auction will be sent to children's caretaker."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"For the winner," Karen continued as two assistants wheeled out two carts, each with a box on it, "we have prepared a lovely meal from the bodies of her two children and placed the heads of her daughters under these boxes.&nbsp; I would like to say it was close, but sadly, it was not.&nbsp; With 64% of the votes, the winner is Carol McNeely."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Louise Rand burst into tears as the assistants lifted the boxes from the carts, revealing the heads of Kimberly and Jessica.&nbsp; Whoever had prepared the heads had done an astounding job.&nbsp; Looking at them, Carol burst into tears.&nbsp; The makeup was perfect; not too heavy and not too light.&nbsp; It was perfect.&nbsp; There was a natural smile on their faces that brought to mind the smiles Kimberly and Jessica had during their picnic the day before Kimberly's death.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"These heads," Karen said, "will be preserved and mounted.&nbsp; If the girls' mother will allow, we will mount them in our studio.&nbsp; We have been given license by the government to make this an annual contest and we would like to have some way of honoring the winners."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol looked at Charlie, who shrugged.&nbsp; Charlie could not advise her in this.&nbsp; Carol thought for a moment.&nbsp; Realizing that having the heads of her daughters would be counter-productive as she would not be able to look at them without feeling sadness, she agreed that Karen proposed a better option. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I would be delighted if they were given a place of honor," she told Karen.&nbsp; "Thank you."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You are welcome," Karen replied as she once again turned to address the gathering.&nbsp; "Dinner will be served momentarily.&nbsp; Please enjoy and thank you for coming."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As they were waiting, Shane came over and sat down.&nbsp; She had gone over to talk to someone on the other production crew.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I understand why the gap was so huge."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Why," Carol asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Ms. Rand, over there," Shane said, "forgot a tourniquet and while she was cutting her daughter's leg, she nicked the femoral artery, like we warned you about.&nbsp; She had forgotten the sealant and by the time she retrieved the can and got back to her daughter, the girl was already dead.&nbsp; They were only 25 minutes into their performance."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I see," Charlie said.&nbsp; "A performance that short would never stand a chance agains the show you and Jessica put on."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol could say nothing.&nbsp; It was over and, somehow, she had won.&nbsp; She would be allowed to raise her remaining daughters.&nbsp; Looking over at Charlie, she realized that she was lucky to have such a good friend.&nbsp; Without the help provided by Kimberly, Jessica, and Charlie, she would never have been able to do it.&nbsp; She decided then to take Charlie up on her offer.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A man approached Carol's table as the food was being brought out.&nbsp; By now, the spit had risen almost 30 inches and Theresa was howling like a banshee.&nbsp; Taking Carol by the hand, the man led her a short distance away so they could hear each other without shouting.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Ms. McNeely," the man said, "I am Tony Harrison, from the State Meat Processing Board.&nbsp; First I want to congratulate you on your win.&nbsp; You did an excellent job with both girls.&nbsp; I am sorry, however, for the pain it has caused you.&nbsp; I, frankly, don't know how you found the strength to go through with it."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I had a lot of help," Carol said, thinking of Kimberly, Jessica, and Charlie.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Anyway," Tony continued as he pulled out a paper from his pocket, "this is your execution summons."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He showed Carol that it was, indeed a letter identical to the one she had received 11 days before.&nbsp; He then ripped it up and pulled a second piece of paper from his pocket.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"This is a statement from the Federal Meat Processing Board.&nbsp; It nullifies any orders requiring you to report for processing.&nbsp; The message will be sent to all plants in the country and your name will be pulled from all culling databases, but that may take a few weeks; four at the most.&nbsp; This will keep you safe in the meantime.&nbsp; Congratulations again, and have a good day."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With that, Mr. Harrison returned to his associates and continued his meal.&nbsp; Carol returned to her table and saw Charlie looking at her untouched plate as Shane bit onto a piece of meat.&nbsp; Carol realized that, like Charlie, she could not get into the idea of eating Kimberly and Jessica like that.&nbsp; Carol was sure they were both delicious, remembering her taste of Jessica from the day before.&nbsp; It was, however, too soon for her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Can we get some of this to take home with us," Carol asked Charlie quietly.&nbsp; "It would be unbelievably rude of me to not partake of what my daughters gave us, but I just cannot do that right now."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Certainly," Charlie said, knowing how Carol felt as she felt the same way.&nbsp; "Let me just box this up."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Good.&nbsp; How soon can we leave without insulting anyone?"

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charlie boxed up the food to take home and, looking around at the gathered people, realized something.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Who gives a fuck if we insult anyone.&nbsp; Let's get the fuck out of here."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yeah," Carol agreed with a smile as she slipped an arm around Charlie's waist.&nbsp; "Let's go home."

The End
