���� Wedding Night

���� by Zebulon

&nbsp;

It was love at first sight.

&nbsp;

Well, almost.

&nbsp;

It would be more accurate to say, she fell in love with him

one piece at a time. The first time she saw him, she fell

immediately and deeply in love with his ass.

&nbsp;

He was huddled with the director over some documents.

And his butt was framed so nicely against his slacks she

couldn't help but notice. It was firm and athletic; not too

fat; not too thin. She could actually see his muscles ripple

as he shifted weight. Nice.

&nbsp;

When he stood, she loved his dark wavy hair and then his

broad shoulders. He reached for a pen; she loved his strong

aristocratic hands. And so it went. She couldn't seem to

look away. Everything she saw she liked. By the time he'd

finished with the director she thought he had the most

incredible body she had ever seen. 'So he'll probably have

the face of a dog,' she thought with regret.

&nbsp;

But when he turned he was more handsome than she could

have imagined. His face combined boyish good looks with

tremendous strength of will. And he looked so cute as he

scanned the room obviously searching for something. He

smiled. She melted. Until she realized he was smiling at

her.

&nbsp;

Caught!

&nbsp;

Turning beet-red she quickly looked down, busying herself

in the work she was supposed to have been doing.

&nbsp;

A few moments later she heard a voice clearing itself in

front of her desk. It was him.

&nbsp;

&quot;It seems we're going to be working together on the new

project.&quot; He had the most beautiful masculine voice she'd

ever heard. And he didn't seem to notice her flushed

appearance and lack of composure. Or he pretended not to.

&nbsp;

It was the start of a wonderful friendship.

&nbsp;

For several weeks they simply worked together. She loved

his competence and friendly manner. It was all strictly

professional. Then one night after working late he took her

out for dinner. They ate. She talked. He listened. He was a

wonderful listener. They had meals together quite often

after that.

&nbsp;

Somewhere along the line she decided that he was the one.

This was the man she was going to marry. She flushed at

her own thoughts. This was so . . . so . . . bold of her. It was

almost out of character. But damn it. He was so perfect.

She just couldn't let him get away. And the project wasn't

going to last forever. And maybe it wasn't so out of

character after all. She had never been pushy, but whenever

she'd really wanted something -- and put her mind to it --

she'd gotten what she was after. And he definitely *was*

the one.

&nbsp;

So she plotted. She schemed. She invited him to her

apartment for dinner.

&nbsp;

The evening went well. But again, she did all the talking

and he did all the listening. And he wasn't making any

moves. She wondered if he might be gay. So she asked.

&nbsp;

He laughed and assured her he wasn't gay.

&nbsp;

&quot;You're not wearing a ring,&quot; she observed.

&nbsp;

&quot;No,&quot; he said with a mischievous grin. &quot;No wife, no

fiancee.&quot; Then his face took on a curious expression which

she couldn't read. &quot;But I'm not quite what you might

expect, either.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; she asked with interest. This would

be a breakthrough. He had never talked about himself

before.

&nbsp;

He looked like he was about to tell her and then seemed to

change his mind. He just laughed again. There was music

in his laughter.

&nbsp;

Now he was not only the most beautiful man she had ever

met. He had also become a mystery. And she just loved a

mystery. It somehow made him that much more desirable

and herself that much more determined. For now she knew

she was truly in love.

&nbsp;

Weeks past. Time was running out. She'd had him over to

dinner several times but he still hadn't made a pass at her

and still he wouldn't tell his secret. She began to wonder if

he might be a spy. But what kind of secret agent spent

weeks doing dull paperwork? The mystery only deepened.

&nbsp;

And despite the fact that he'd never made any moves,

despite the fact he'd gently turned aside the few moves

she'd made toward him, despite his perfect

gentlemanliness, she was convinced he was attracted to her

as well. He must have found her desirable. Why else would

he spend all his free time with her? But when the final few

days of the project were clearly in sight, she had the

panicky feeling that it would soon be over and he would

walk out of her life forever.

&nbsp;

Just when it seemed there was no hope left, he invited her

over to his place for dinner. She'd never seen his apartment

before. There had been an unspoken understanding

between them that his private life was not a subject for

discussion. She didn't even have his home phone number.

And now he was inviting her in. She just knew something

important was going to happen.

&nbsp;

She was surprised how ordinary everything seemed to be.

Just a nice, normal-looking bachelor's apartment. No spy

stuff, nothing unusual at all. But it was clean and

comfortable. She liked that but it didn't provide any

answers.

&nbsp;

They ate. He had prepared everything himself and it was all

wonderful. Afterward they sat together in the living room

but this time she wasn't about to let him off the hook by

doing all of the talking. They sat together in silence. He

looked like he was working up the nerve to say something.

Or perhaps he was trying to find the right words.

&nbsp;

&quot;I know how you feel about me,&quot; he said at last. &quot;And I

feel the same way about you.&quot; Her heart skipped a beat.

&nbsp;

There followed a long silence.

&nbsp;

&quot;But?&quot; she prompted.

&nbsp;

&quot;But I'm not at all what you might expect.&quot; He looked up

at her with a lopsided grin.

&nbsp;

&quot;So tell me,&quot; she said.

&nbsp;

&quot;That's just it,&quot; he said. &quot;I can't.&quot;

&nbsp;

'Can't or won't?' she wondered.

&nbsp;

But studying her face intently he asked, &quot;Would you take

me . . . sight unseen, for better or worse, for richer or

poorer, for the rest of our lives?&quot;

&nbsp;

Her heart caught in her throat. This was so sudden and so

completely unexpected.

&nbsp;

He continued, &quot;Would you take me to love, to honor, to

cherish and to obey? Please don't answer without thinking

about it. Would you leave with me right now if I asked? No

questions asked. To go where I tell you, to do what I tell

you, so long as we both shall live? Would you take me as

your husband and become what I want you to be, knowing

that you'll receive no explanations or promises from me

until after we were married?&quot;

&nbsp;

This was so weird. Alarm bells were ringing all across her

consciousness. But her hormones and desires were racing

far ahead of common sense. And some deep internal voice

was assuring her that everything would work out

wonderfully. She stood, walked to the big window, and

looked out over the city. 'Would she leave with him right

now?' he had asked her. She wondered where he would

take her.

&nbsp;

&quot;Another country,&quot; he said in answer to her unspoken

question. &quot;When the time comes we will leave and may not

come back for years. . . . If ever.&quot;

&nbsp;

She closed her eyes and searched her feelings. Was this

really what she wanted? Was he? 'When the time comes,'

he had said. She supposed he would want to leave pretty

soon. Probably as soon as the project was completed. And

that would mean no fancy wedding. She'd always dreamed

of a big wedding. But she realized that what she really

wanted was him.

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes,&quot; she said finally, almost to herself. Turning she

looked at him and repeated herself more firmly. &quot;Yes. I'll

go were you say, and do what you say, and be whatever

you want.&quot; She rushed back over to him and hopped into

his lap. &quot;For now and forever, until death do us part.&quot; And

for the first time, they kissed. He was a wonderful kisser. It

lasted a long time.

&nbsp;

When he finally pulled away he looked at her with a

mixture of delight and something else she couldn't identify.

Something darker and more mysterious.

&nbsp;

&quot;With no questions asked?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;With no questions asked.&quot;

&nbsp;

He smiled at her. &quot;Well then, I guess you'd better make

wedding plans. We can leave afterwards.&quot;

&nbsp;

She threw her arms around him and gave him a huge hug.

This was perfect. Everything she had ever wanted just

seemed to be coming to her.

&nbsp;

�������������� - - - - -

&nbsp;

She was sitting in the hotel bar. She'd been sitting there,

nursing her drink, for almost half an hour.

&nbsp;

He had asked her to wait while he went up to the

honeymoon suite to 'make some arrangements.'

&nbsp;

She was so excited she could hardly contain herself.

Whatever it was, it was going to be great.

&nbsp;

She heard a muffled ring behind the murmured

conversation of the other guests. The waitress brought her a

house phone. &quot;OK,&quot; he said. &quot;Come on up.&quot; She found

herself trembling with anticipation.

&nbsp;

He was waiting at the elevator as the doors opened. So was

another man. They were talking.

&nbsp;

&quot;. . . and you're sure?&quot; the man was asking.

&nbsp;

He seemed to ignore the question and instead looked at her

with approval as she stepped out of the elevator. &quot;Oh

yeah,&quot; he replied absently.

&nbsp;

The man looked at her with curiosity. &quot;But this is so

permanent,&quot; he said to no one in particular.

&nbsp;

&quot;You worry about the travel arrangements,&quot; he said

without heat; &quot;I'll worry about my life.&quot; It sounded like the

man was an old friend. She wondered why he was there.

&nbsp;

&quot;No problem,&quot; the man said. &quot;Just call down when you're

ready.&quot; And with that, he stepped into the elevator and was

still studying her with interest as the doors closed.

&nbsp;

Nothing was said. They simply walked hand-in-hand to the

honeymoon suite.

&nbsp;

When he opened the door she was impressed with the size

and opulence of the room. The lighting was dim, lit only by

the glow of incensed candles. Even by the dim light it was

clear that the furnishings were magnificent. But that

business of waiting in the bar. Something special had to be

going on. She took a few steps and scanned the room trying

to spot what it was.

&nbsp;

Nothing.

&nbsp;

She'd just about decided whatever it was must be in the

bedroom as he came up and wrapped his arms around her.

He gave her a big hug and nuzzled her ear.

&nbsp;

&quot;Mmmmmmm,&quot; she said, &quot;that's nice.&quot;

&nbsp;

He slowly and sensually removed her clothing as he

continued to squeeze, kiss and fondle her. By the time he

was finished she was stark naked and completely aroused.

Her nipples were firmly erect and she could feel the heat

between her thighs.

&nbsp;

&quot;What about you?&quot; she asked with mock chagrin since he

was still dressed.

&nbsp;

He stepped back and held his arms out at his sides. His

beatific smile was all the invitation she needed. She

returned the favor, taking her time and using all her wiles

to make him as hot as he had made her.

&nbsp;

Soon he was as naked as she was, his pole standing at rigid

attention. She sank down to her knees and began sensually

sucking him off. This was one of the first tricks he had

taught her and one of her best. Their relationship had been

non-sexual for such a long time. Then it went through a

long period of training. He'd introduced her so many new

things -- including bondage. In fact, she'd learned some of

her best fellatio techniques in much this same position. On

her knees but with her hands bound behind her back.

&nbsp;

He made delicious sounds of enjoyment and approval as

she worked on his rod. But he pulled her off and up to her

feet before he came.

&nbsp;

He led her to the bedroom and opened the door. &quot;A special

little something just for you,&quot; he said.

&nbsp;

By now her vision had adjusted to the dimness. And what

she saw made her eyes almost pop. There, tied down in the

center of the large master bed. There was a naked girl.

Even by the light of the flickering candles it was clear she

was beautiful. She looked to be in her early 20's. She had

long blond hair which was pooled around her head. Her

arms had been cuffed together and tied straight up toward

the center of the headboard. Her legs were widely splayed

and tied to the bottom legs of the bed. Her crotch was

pulled wide open and fully exposed. Her breasts were

heaving with her labored breathing.

&nbsp;

The girl was also wearing a padded gag which she knew

from experience would very effectively muffle any sounds

she might try to make. But she wasn't trying to make

sounds. The girl was studying the two of them with great

intensity as she shifted uncomfortably in her bondage.

&nbsp;

As she stood in the doorway examining the girl, the man

had come up and hugged her gently from behind. He

tweaked one of her nipples.

&nbsp;

&quot;You like?&quot; he asked almost slyly.

&nbsp;

She took stock of her thoughts. In the time they had known

each other she had changed so much. She'd learned all

about his kinks and he had helped her to release her own.

She had been so inhibited when they met. And now.

&nbsp;

She turned in his arms and kissed him deeply. And as she

did her thoughts were still working furiously. Together

they had plumbed the depths of her own kinky fantasies.

They'd discovered her deeply buried interest in lesbianism

and dominance. But this was so much. She'd never actually

been with another woman, although they'd talked about it

often enough. This was totally unexpected. For a brief

moment she was undecided. But that quickly passed. She

knew she would hate herself in the morning if she let this

opportunity go by. She broke off the kiss and looked back

at the bound girl again.

&nbsp;

The girl seemed to hold her breath for a moment and was

listening intently.

&nbsp;

She knew what she wanted. &quot;I like,&quot; she said.

&nbsp;

&quot;You might want to be gentle with her,&quot; he said. &quot;I
think

she's a virgin.&quot; 

&nbsp;

That surprised her. She turned and took a step closer to the

girl who flinched at her approach.

&nbsp;

She turned back. &quot;A virgin?&quot; she said. &quot;Then wouldn't
you

. . . ?&quot; The thought was left unfinished.

&nbsp;

The man smiled at her. &quot;Nonsense,&quot; he said. &quot;I've had

virgins before. This is your special night. You go first.&quot;

&nbsp;

They kissed again. She let herself be enfolded by his strong

arms. She felt so incredibly loved at that moment. Then she

thought again about the girl. Who was she? A virgin? She

couldn't be a hooker. Someone he knew? Was it possible

she was just some girl he had yanked off of the street? At

one time that thought would have repulsed her. But she'd

changed so much.

&nbsp;

When she turned back to the girl her mind was set and she

was wearing a delightfully evil expression. The girl who

had been watching intently started to tremble.

&nbsp;

She moved in to have a closer look while the man took a

seat in the corner.

&nbsp;

The girl really was quite beautiful. As pretty as she had

looked from across the room, she was absolutely stunning

when seen up close. Her face, as near as she could tell

around the gag, was that of a fashion model. Her body

wasn't exactly athletic, but she was clearly in excellent

shape and her curves were luscious. Her arms and legs

were long and well formed. And her torso. Ahh that was

truly splendid. Fairly large, very round, and very firm

breasts. With large firm nipples set off by small very pink

areolas. Lovely. A beautiful, well-formed navel. And her

pussy. Well, it was hard to tell in that light, but from what

she could see, her slit was full and pale and surrounded by

a patch of very smooth bare skin. Someone had carefully

shaved off all the pubic hair. From the appearance it had

been done quite recently. And from the look on the face

behind the gag, it had been done by someone other than the

girl herself.

&nbsp;

She almost reached down and stroked the tender flesh. But

that would come in its proper time. Right now she just

wanted to savor the moment.

&nbsp;

She walked around the right side of the bed. The girl didn't

try to turn her head, but simply followed with her eyes.

&nbsp;

She reached down and felt the tension in the rope that

bound her arms to the top of the bed. Tight. Nice. She

wasn't going anywhere. The girl had beautiful hands.

&nbsp;

She moved back to the foot of the bed and looked at the

girl's feet. They were just as beautiful. She moved to the

left corner of the bed and felt the girl's toes. The girl

started at the touch.

&nbsp;

She slid her hand up over the girl's foot and felt her ankle.

Then as she moved up toward the middle of the bed, letting

her fingers lightly trace a path along the inside of the girl's

leg, past her knee, and along the inside of her thigh. The

girl twitched at the unwonted touch.

&nbsp;

The bound girl's gaze flicked briefly at the man sitting in

the corner and quickly back to the woman who was

hovering overhead.

&nbsp;

She let her fingers trace a detour around the bound girl's

public area. Sitting on the bed, she continued moving her

fingers up across the girl's belly and along the side of her

closest breast.

&nbsp;

&quot;So tell me, Luv,&quot; she asked, &quot;are you a Virgin?&quot;

&nbsp;

No answer. The girl just continued to stare.

&nbsp;

The fingers moved across the breast and gently grasped the

nipple.

&nbsp;

&quot;Well?&quot;

&nbsp;

Still no answer.

&nbsp;

She mashed the nipple with considerable force which

elicited a muffled yelp of pain from behind the gag. The

girl's eyes started watering. Without raising her voice, the

woman said, &quot;When I ask a question, you answer.&quot;

&nbsp;

The girl nodded frantically.

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes?&quot; the woman asked without relaxing her grip.

&nbsp;

The girl kept nodding and tried her best to wriggle free of

the woman's grasp.

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes, you understand? Or yes, you're a virgin?&quot;

&nbsp;

The girl whined into her gag, jerked around as best she

could, and looked frantic.

&nbsp;

The woman released the pressure. &quot;Do you understand?&quot;

&nbsp;

Another quick nod.

&nbsp;

&quot;Are you a virgin?&quot;

&nbsp;

The girl shut her eyes tightly and nodded again.

&nbsp;

The woman continued her explorations. Having asserted

her dominance, she was taking delight in the look and feel

of this delightful young girl's body. She explored

everything except her crotch. She was saving that for last.

She felt the girl's ears around the gag, her face, her neck,

her other breast, her arms. She was having a great time

simply running her fingers and hands along the various

contours of the girl's smooth body.

&nbsp;

After a long time at this she removed her hand and used it

to feel between her own legs. God, she was wet. The bound

girl had opened her eyes and was watching her.

&nbsp;

&quot;Fun time,&quot; she said to no one in particular. She reached

over to feel the smooth skin of the freshly shaved mound of

Venus. She could see the girl swallow hard and try not to

move at the touch. Slipping her finger downward into the

warm slit, she realized the girl was not particularly wet. A

little damp perhaps, but probably more scared than aroused.

&nbsp;

She smiled and started to rhythmically rub the girl's clit.

She knew what she was doing. The man had taught her

well. Quite soon the girl was very wet indeed, in spite of

herself. She had futilely tried to close her legs. Failing in

that, she had closed her eyes again and tried to shut

everything out. Now she was making little mewing noises

through her nose.

&nbsp;

Never stopping her hand movements through the wet folds

of the bound girl's private areas, the woman shifted

position and climbed up onto the bed. She got up on her

knees and leaning down kissed one of the very erect

nipples. She was rewarded to hear a muffled betrayal of

passion.

&nbsp;

She licked. She sucked. She nipped. All the while her

fingers continuing to manipulate the tender flesh and little

bud nestled within. And as she became aware the girl was

getting close to coming, she suddenly stopped. The girl's

eyes flew wide open.

&nbsp;

The woman stretched and straightened her hair. She got up

off of the bed and moved down between the bound girl's

legs. Then repositioning herself she lay with her face only a

half foot away from the wetly glistening pussy. She knew

what she was going to do next, but had never actually

touched another clit with her tongue. She looked at the

engorged folds of flesh. She squeezed the sides of the

pussy cleft and caused the clit to pooch up and out. She

drew in deep breath of the other girl's scent and decided

she liked it very much indeed.

&nbsp;

Leaning forward she gave the little bud a small kiss. Then

she stuck out her tongue and gave it a little lick. She found

she liked the taste as much as the aroma. And almost

without thinking she leaned forward and took up the

manipulations with her tongue that she had been doing with

her fingers only moments before.

&nbsp;

Within seconds the girl was moaning and humming again.

&nbsp;

She stopped. &quot;Do you like that?&quot;

&nbsp;

No answer.

&nbsp;

She reached up with one hand and felt for a nipple.

&nbsp;

&quot;Um hum, um hum.&quot; The girl was nodding energetically.

&nbsp;

&quot;Don't make me ask you twice.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Um hum.&quot;

&nbsp;

More licking. She brought the girl close to orgasm and then

stopped again. &quot;Do you really like that?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Um hum.&quot; There was a plaintive quality to the girl's nasal

reply and looking up, the woman saw tears running down

the sides of her face.

&nbsp;

More licking. She licked slowly and carefully to bring the

girl close without tripping her over. She brought a hand

down and used her fingers to tickle the sensitive flesh

around her vaginal opening and anus. Then when she

judged the time was exactly right, when the girl was

twitching and writhing in rhythm to her licking and

fingering, she grasped the little bud with her lips exerting

considerable force and started licking very quickly and

very firmly indeed. 

&nbsp;

And the girl exploded in her mouth. She hadn't been quite

sure what to expect. But this was delectable. The pelvis

under her head was bucking and thrashing. And she could

feel the pussy flesh pulsing and throbbing under her lips.

She drew out the girl's climax for quite some time.

&nbsp;

And when the woman was quite satisfied, and the girl half

dead, she wiped her face against the girl's inner thighs.

Then she sat up and with a self-satisfied tone said, &quot;my

turn.&quot;

&nbsp;

She crawled up over the girl's body and began kissing her

breasts and nipples in earnest. While doing so, she

positioned her crotch over one of the girl's thighs. One

knee was between the girl's legs, the other outside. And she

used the girl's upper thigh to stimulate her own clitoris.

Her public hair was painting a wet patch on the bound

girl's leg as her passions rose.

&nbsp;

She felt the man's hand on her shoulder. Looking over she

saw he was handing her a strange looking dildo.

&nbsp;

&quot;Perhaps this might help,&quot; he said lecherously.

&nbsp;

She recognized it as an attachment which would fit neatly

into the front of the girl's gag. It was one of the things he

had shown her in an adult sex shop during an excursion.

&nbsp;

She snapped the device into place and enjoyed the look of

near horror which came over the bound girl's face.

&nbsp;

Taking a nipple firmly in hand, she said, &quot;now you are

going to cooperate with me on this, aren't you.&quot;

&nbsp;

The girl merely made a loud mewing noise as the tip of the

dildo darted wildly around.

&nbsp;

Sighing, the woman mashed her nipple again.

&nbsp;

&quot;Um hum, um hum, um hum.&quot; Her tears were flowing

freely now and the dildo was bobbing up and down.

&nbsp;

&quot;Good.&quot; The woman moved up and squatted over the dildo.

Taking it carefully in hand, she sank down until it was well

buried in her own cunt and she could feel her tender flesh

resting against the girl's face. She carefully leaned forward

until she was laid out almost flat against the other girl. Her

weight was still mostly on her knees and elbows, but she

was comfortably working the dildo in and out of her pussy

and using the bound girl's nose to stimulate her clit. She

found her own breasts were rubbing against the girl's

hands.

&nbsp;

She stopped and said, &quot;Well? Are you going to help me or

not? I don't feel your hands moving.&quot;

&nbsp;

And as she went back to stimulating herself by fucking the

bound girl's unwilling face, she felt the girl using her

hands, as best she could, to squeeze and rub her breasts.

&nbsp;

After awhile she realized that while it was good, it wasn't

good enough. She might eventually bring herself off this

way. But she had tongued the girl to a delightful orgasm.

The least the girl could do was to thank her properly by

responding in kind. She wanted to free her mouth and

thought about asking the man first, but what the hell. He

said this was her night. It was time to really take the reigns

and assert her dominance over this lovely little bitch.

&nbsp;

The bound girl hadn't understood why the woman had

stopped. She clearly hadn't climaxed yet. What was next?

&nbsp;

The woman lifted herself off of the dildo and repositioned

herself on the bed next to the bound girl. For a long time

she said nothing and simply stroked the girl's face and

looked into her eyes.

&nbsp;

Then she reached down and firmly grasped a nipple again.

The girl trembled visibly and awaited the crushing pain.

But the pain didn't come. Instead the woman said, &quot;Slut.&quot;

The bound girl almost jerked at the epithet. &quot;How would

you like to have that gag out of your mouth?&quot;

&nbsp;

'What was this?' the girl wondered. She looked over at the

man.

&nbsp;

Pain! The woman was mashing her nipple again. &quot;Don't

look at him! Look at me. And answer my question.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Um hum,&quot; the girl said quickly through her tears.

&nbsp;

The pressure relaxed. &quot;Hmmmmm,&quot; the woman said. And

looking at the bound girl's breast she started palming it.

&quot;Nice.&quot; Then looking back into the girl's eyes she said,

&quot;Here's the drill. I'm going to remove the gag. You will

not make a sound. You will NOT look at him again until

I'm through with you. You WILL concentrate all your

attention on me. Do you understand?&quot;

&nbsp;

The girl didn't understand. But she bobbed the dildo again

in the affirmative. &quot;Um hum.&quot; Her eyes remained fixed on

the terrible woman who's hand was still firmly grasping

her abused breast.

&nbsp;

&quot;You liked the way I licked you, didn't you?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Um hum,&quot; the girl replied wondering where this was

going.

&nbsp;

&quot;And you're going to return the favor now, aren't you?&quot;

&nbsp;

The bound girl's eyes got big and began to water even

more. A brief moment passed and she realized that if she

didn't answer quickly she'd get her nipple squashed again.

&quot;Um hum.&quot;

&nbsp;

The woman went back to lightly scratching the girl's

breasts. She clearly seemed to be very pleased with the way

the conversation had gone. Then she started removing the

gag. But just before she took it out she hissed menacingly,

&quot;you fuck with me and I'll make you wish you were never

born.&quot; There was an intense moment of silence as their

eye's locked. &quot;Understand?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Um hum.&quot;

&nbsp;

And then the gag was out. The bound girl breathed deeply

through her mouth and made a conscious effort NOT to

look at the man. Instead she keep her eyes firmly focused

on the woman's face. She lost sight of the woman's eyes

only when the lowering pussy obscured her vision.

&nbsp;

The woman was back in the same position she'd enjoyed

before. Half sitting on the bound girl's face, leaning over

and having her breasts massaged. But this time, she could

feel the little trollop's tongue working in and around her

public slit, massaging her clit. She loved the warm feel of

the girl's mouth and the gentle, insistent pressure of her

lips. It was obvious the girl had no idea what she was

doing. But it was just as obvious she was doing the best she

could. And that was, after all, the real turn on.

&nbsp;

The woman wanted to tease herself. This was even more

delicious than she had imagined. She would let herself get

close to coming and then back off, rising up off the bound

girl's face. The girl would take a few heaving breaths. The

woman loved the sound of that. It seemed to intensify the

pleasure. 

&nbsp;

Then she would sink back and ride the girl's face some

more. She did this several times until she reached a crest

which was so high and so unexpected that she tripped over,

almost without being aware of it. She found herself

climaxing with a jarring concussion. She'd come with great

wracking sobs and experienced one of the all time best

orgasms she'd ever known.

&nbsp;

For a long time afterward she merely lay there. The woman

quietly basking in the afterglow of her sexual exploit. The

bound girl weeping softly into the wet crotch which was

still draped over and around her tired mouth.

&nbsp;

After awhile, the man came up and helped the woman to

unsteady feet. Nothing was said. They just hugged. The

bound girl's muffled sobs were a strange accompaniment to

the silent couple as they embraced.

&nbsp;

The woman thought to herself, 'He was sooo incredible. He

was sooo perfect. Sooo good to her.' Then, remembering

the girl, she reached over and refitted her with the gag. The

girl didn't protest or offer any resistance.

&nbsp;

&quot;You OK?&quot; he asked after she had finished with the gag.

&nbsp;

&quot;Fabulous,&quot; she said.

&nbsp;

He smiled down at her.

&nbsp;

She smiled back up. &quot;You're leaving soon, aren't you?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Later tonight.&quot;

&nbsp;

She sighed with regret. &quot;You know where to find me.&quot;

&nbsp;

He smiled again. &quot;I know.&quot;

&nbsp;

She gave him another huge hug and said, &quot;thank you&quot; into

his shoulder.

&nbsp;

When they broke off, he patted her butt and pointed her

toward the bathroom. She padded off with huge smile of

contentment.

&nbsp;

He's eyes followed as she left. And he continued to look

thoughtfully at the closed bathroom door until well after

the shower had started.

&nbsp;

The girl on the bed made a plaintive little noise which

recalled his attention. She was still crying and her face was

quite damp both from tears and from the other woman's

juices.

&nbsp;

He looked down at her and smiled his best angelic smile. &quot;I

haven't forgotten about you.&quot; Climbing onto the bed he lay

on top of the bound girl and removed the dildo from the

gag. He tossed it aside and gently kissed her on the

forehead. &quot;You were wonderful.&quot; He positioned the head of

his now throbbing cock against her tender hole and

carefully worked it in and out until he had pushed past the

resistance of her maidenhead. Then, burying himself in her

for the first time, he proceeded to consummate his

marriage.
