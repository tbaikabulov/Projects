 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Chapter 1:&nbsp; The Realization
Margaret&#8217;s eyes fluttered open to dim, gray light.&nbsp; She yawned and stretched, feeling intensely cold and stiff.&nbsp; As her senses returned to her she soon found out why.&nbsp; She&#8217;d been sleeping on concrete, and if that wasn&#8217;t strange enough, she had been doing so stark naked!&nbsp; She sat up slowly, her head aching.&nbsp; 
How did I get here?&nbsp; She wondered.&nbsp; 
Margaret furrowed her brow and tried to recall something&#8212;anything that might give her some sort of a clue.&nbsp; She took a deep breath and thought back to her last memory.&nbsp; The last thing she remembered was walking.&nbsp; It must have been home from school because she remembered wearing her school uniform.&nbsp; It was the last month of her senior year of high school and the weather was perfect for walking.&nbsp; Margaret was a very good student and had been since kindergarten.&nbsp; It didn&#8217;t make her overwhelmingly popular with the other students, especially the boys.&nbsp; It had gotten worse as she had gotten older.&nbsp; Boys didn&#8217;t like being shown up by girls.&nbsp; Margaret knew it.&nbsp; Her mother had urged her more than once to be a bit more �modest� about her intellect, especially around the boys, but she had not heeded the warning and so Margaret had no real friends and had yet to have been asked out on a single date.&nbsp; She would have said no to the latter, of course.&nbsp; There was not a single boy worth her time at school.&nbsp; She had plans of waiting for college to try out that kind of thing, where there would be college men not boys.&nbsp; So, because Margaret already had a full ride scholarship to a prestigious university and because of her lack of social life, she&#8217;d already long since checked out and was just going through the motions until she could go on to bigger and better things that would indeed be worth her time.&nbsp; 
So, Margaret remembered the walking, but then things promptly became hazy.&nbsp; She&#8217;d rounded a corner and then�nothing.&nbsp; Her mind was completely blank after that.&nbsp; The hairs on the back of her neck pricked up when she finally realized the obvious.&nbsp; 
Have I been kidnapped? She shook her head.&nbsp; I thought this kind of thing on happened in movies!
Trying to remain calm she busied herself by taking stock of her surroundings.&nbsp; Panic, after all, would get her nowhere.&nbsp; She was in a small concrete room.&nbsp; Not tall enough, even for her at 4&#8217; 9&#8217;&#8217; to stand up it, and it was just wide enough for her to turn around.&nbsp; Behind her there was a solid cinderblock wall and in front of her there was a metal door with a narrow opening about a thumb&#8217;s length from the top.&nbsp; Pale light streamed in through it causing her too wince when she looked too close.&nbsp; She crawled forward on the hard concrete and looked out through the opening.&nbsp; She could see a beige tile floor, a row of identical doors to the one she was behind, each with a white number painted on it.&nbsp; In the distance she could hear noises, like the barking of dogs, or the meowing of cats, but the sounds were muffled and just didn&#8217;t sound quite right for some reason.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where in the hell am I?&nbsp; She mouthed the words.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not certain if it was a good idea or not, Margaret put her mouth up to the opening to call out to whoever was keeping her there.&nbsp; She figured that whoever had kidnapped her, because she was now certain that that is what all this was, kidnapping, would come sooner or later.&nbsp; She preferred sooner so that at least she would know where she stood.&nbsp; The only thing that really concerned her was that when they did come she wouldn&#8217;t have anything to cover up with!
Margaret, however, was taken aback when instead of, �Hello?� coming out of her mouth; a pitiful whine escaped her parted lips.&nbsp; Shocked, she tried again, with the same frightening result.&nbsp; After testing her voice a little she found that she could indeed not speak.&nbsp; All she could do was make noises like some kind of animal.&nbsp; Fear rising in her she reached up to feel her throat and tried to speak again, even just one word.&nbsp; Nothing&#8212;she could not speak at all!&nbsp; She&#8217;d noticed something else when she felt the soft skin around her neck, something equally disturbing.&nbsp; Her hands, while still having feeling, didn&#8217;t really move.&nbsp; Testing this as well, she found that she could no longer move her fingers.&nbsp; They just hung there limply.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Margaret looked at her useless hands, heard herself make another whining noise, and panicked.&nbsp; She banged against the metal door with her useless hands and let lose a torrent of unintelligible noises.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What have you done to me!&nbsp; Her mind screamed in the absence of her mouth.&nbsp; What have you bastards done to me!
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her furry lasted for only a few minutes.&nbsp; Margaret soon found that she was completely exhausted for her efforts and the door was still firmly blocking her path.&nbsp; However, her frantic and fruitless display soon did attract attention.&nbsp; She heard heavy footsteps against the tile floor, and then she saw two pairs of legs in front of the door and heard the voices of two men.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Looks like little, sixteen is awake!�&nbsp; A man said in a singsong voice. �And according to this she&#8217;s healed and ready to be put out on the floor.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Looks like it,� another man agreed.&nbsp; �Hold on a sec, I got it.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She heard the door in front of her rattle as the bolt was pulled back.&nbsp; Margaret froze.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t know rather she should back up against the wall or try to make a break for it.&nbsp; In the moment of her indecision the door opened, flooding the small space with pale light and almost blinding her.&nbsp; One of the men reached in and grabbed her by her shoulder length, raven colored hair, and yanked her out of the tiny compartment.&nbsp; Margaret struggled as the other one took a hold of her too.&nbsp; In the midst of her fighting, one of them slipped something cold around her neck.&nbsp; Then they both let her go.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Margaret, no longer frozen, and no nearly as self-conscious as she thought she would be, tried to stand up and run, but all she could do was try.&nbsp; She&#8217;d gotten onto her knees just fine, but the second she tried to rise above that she got extremely dizzy and fell over, much to the amusement of the two men.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I love it when imports do that!�&nbsp; The second man laughed.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s so fucking cute!�&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first man agreed as she got back on her hands and knees and then backed into the wall.&nbsp; Margaret was mortified, she was completely naked, on her hands and knees and she just realized what they&#8217;d put around her neck.&nbsp; It was a shiny, metal choke chain!
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I love it,� the first man said, gathering up some of the length of the chain in his hand, �when they act all shy like that.�&nbsp; He leered down at Margaret who was trying desperately to cover herself with her hands.&nbsp; Then he yanked the chain, pulling her forward.&nbsp; Margaret learned quickly to follow where she was led.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t want to get choked after all!&nbsp; They took her through a door and out into a large well lit room.&nbsp; A mixture of smells and sounds hit her nose and her ears, cat litter, hamster woodchips, dog food, meowing, barking, and chirping.&nbsp; It was unmistakably a pet shop.&nbsp; Margaret, however, had to do a double take, because the pets in the cages weren&#8217;t animals, they were other women!
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where in the hell am I?&nbsp; She asked herself again.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was led to the front of the room past all the other pets.&nbsp; She caught sight of a row of cages on one wall each one occupied by a pretty woman with silly looking cat ears on their heads and what looked like cartoon cat paws on their hands and feet.&nbsp; Weirder still they were acting like cats, making the same noises, and moving like them too.&nbsp; Margaret saw cages near the middle of the store that held women in a similar situation; only instead of cat&#8217;s they appeared to be bunnies.&nbsp; She was lead through so quickly and she was so shocked by what she was seeing it was hard for Margaret to take it all in.&nbsp; Finally, she&#8217;d reached her destination.&nbsp; In front of the big store window there was an empty pen.&nbsp; One of the men picked her up as if she weighed nothing and set her unceremoniously into the pen.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He took off the choke chain and smirked down at her, �There we are, little pup.�&nbsp; Then he looked at the other man, �How long do you think before she sells?�&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The other man laughed, �That little runt?�&nbsp; He asked and then walked off.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Don&#8217;t worry, little pup,� the smirking man said as he reached down and ruffled her hair.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m sure someone will buy you.�&nbsp; Then he walked off too.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After being left alone, Margaret wasn&#8217;t even sure how she should feel.&nbsp; After all, she was in such a bizarre situation it was hard to know what the appropriate response should be.&nbsp; She crawled, because that&#8217;s all she could do, to the window and looked out.&nbsp; The pet store, because that&#8217;s what it was, seemed to be inside of some mall.&nbsp; A lot of the stores looked typical enough.&nbsp; There were a few clothing stores across the way and a shoe store too, but then she noticed one place in particular that certainly was anything but typical, at least in her experience.&nbsp; The sign above the door read �Buxom Bodies� and in the wide store window she saw just that.&nbsp; There were naked women with voluptuous bodies parading back and forth in the widow.&nbsp; People walked by as if that was completely normal.&nbsp; Oh, but the women weren&#8217;t completely naked; they did have on gaudy six inch heels!&nbsp; 
Margaret took a closer look at the people walking around the mall too.&nbsp; There were a lot more men than women, but the women were certainly a lot more conspicuous.&nbsp; One, for example, had a whore&#8217;s mask of makeup, and wore a hopelessly short and tight black leather miniskirt, with an equally tight blue tube top that could barely contain her amble breasts, and a pair of heels that made the ones that the women in the �Buxom Bodies� window were wearing look dignified.&nbsp; The woman followed after a man wearing an expensive suit with an incredibly slutty walk.&nbsp; 
Margaret saw other women like that, but other than looking more than a little trashy, they weren&#8217;t all that odd.&nbsp; No, Margaret wasn&#8217;t shocked again until she saw what she thought was a pouty little girl.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t until her and the man that she was with walked close to the window that Margaret realized that there was something not quite right about them.&nbsp; The girl was dressed like a very young child, in a pretty, frilly pink dress that barely reached the top of her thighs.&nbsp; She had on a matching lacy, pink baby bonnet over blonde, sausage curls, white bobby socks, and shiny white Mary Jane&#8217;s.&nbsp; Completing her childish ensemble, she had a pacifier in her mouth, padded pink mittens, and a bib around her neck that said, �I love my Daddy!�&nbsp; As they came closer Margaret noticed several things were wrong, the first being her height.&nbsp; She appeared to be about five feet tall, taller than Margaret, and taller than any girl young enough to be dressed the way she was, but that was the least of it.&nbsp; The pacifier had a strap on either side of it that ran across her cheek and disappeared into the mess of curls and fastened presumably behind her head so that she couldn&#8217;t spit it out.&nbsp; The mittens had lace around the cuffs, but Margaret could see also that there were little pad locks hanging off of them.&nbsp; The man she was with had a child harness on her too and was dragging her along by it.&nbsp; The woman, because now Margaret could see that she was about the same age as her, stumbled in front of the window.&nbsp; She briefly turned her fact toward the window, and Margaret could see the tears running down her cheeks.&nbsp; The man she was with pulled her upright by her arm.
Margaret could hear him scold her through the glass, �Bad girl, Suzy!�&nbsp; He swatted her on the behind hard.&nbsp; �We&#8217;ll have none of that!�
Still holding the woman&#8217;s arm, the man look in the window at Margaret and tapped on the glass.&nbsp; With his eyes upon her, Margaret suddenly became very aware of her nakedness again.&nbsp; She backed away from the window on her knees with her legs together and her hands across her chest.&nbsp; 
The man seemed to smile at this and then looked down at the crying woman he held, �If you&#8217;re very good, Suzy, maybe I&#8217;ll buy you a puppy some day!�&nbsp; He said chuckling before moving on.&nbsp; 
When he&#8217;d left Margaret felt braver and crawled back to the window, both anxious and afraid to see what other bizarre things were going on outside.&nbsp; She saw more slutty looking women, and more dressed like little girls, some of which seemed to be quite happy as they skipped along, holding hands with the man they were with, sometimes eating candy or ice cream.&nbsp; She saw a woman following a man dressed like a French maid out of some pervert&#8217;s fantasy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she saw something that made her blood run cold.&nbsp; She saw a man leading a collared woman on a leash.&nbsp; The woman was completely naked, just like Margaret, on her hands and knees, her long hair in pigtails with white ribbons.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t so much the degrading position that she was in that bothered Margaret, it was that the woman didn&#8217;t seem bothered by it in the least.&nbsp; Margaret watched as they walked, or rather as he walked and she crawled, by, her eyes glued to the poor woman.&nbsp; 
She looked at her surroundings again.&nbsp; She was in the window of a pet store.&nbsp; She&#8217;d been called a puppy twice.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t walk, she couldn&#8217;t use her hands, and she couldn&#8217;t speak.&nbsp; Was what she had just seen her future?&nbsp; Suddenly Margaret knew the right response to the situation.&nbsp; She collapsed into the most private corner of the pen, which wasn&#8217;t at all private, and cried and cried and cried.&nbsp; 
Next Chapter:&nbsp; The Purchase&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This is a story I plan to continue, unlike the other one&#8217;s I&#8217;ve posted.&nbsp; In the next chapter Margaret is purchased by a man and learns more about where she is and possibly even how she got there.&nbsp;
