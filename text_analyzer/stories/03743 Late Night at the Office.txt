Late Night at the Office

Synopsis: Thomas is too preoccupied with work to notice Mina the cleaning lady - he pays for this slightLate Night at the Office 
Thomas owned a small architectural firm; actually co-owned it. He was 43,
  divorced, no kids, a small guy but in pretty good shape and made good money,
  but sometimes had to work long hours. As a small outfit, they depended upon
  small- and medium-sized jobs to fill their coffers. The firm currently had
  a job that would pay lots of bills and then some, but it would require lots
  of late nights at the office, and would continue to do so for the foreseeable
  future. Thomas didn't mind so much, the others had families to go home to and
  he had an empty condominium. Not that he was always alone or lonely, but after
  the divorce settlement he was more interested in playing the field, trying
  to find his one lasting mate, instead of another four year marriage. 
Thomas was working late tonight, another wasted Friday night he chuckled.
  Oh well, he would go to the restaurant down the road for a quick bite later,
  sometimes the bar area was a good place to meet nice women. 
Mina was part of the cleaning crew for now. She was only working at night
  to help out her aunt, who owned the cleaning business that had a contract with
  the building in which Thomas worked. Mina was 20, tall (6') and dark, of Hispanic
  descent. She was very athletic, had been on the local Junior College softball
  team, all-conference at that. She was currently out of school, between semesters.
  She was earning the money to help finish her two-year degree as a paralegal.
  She loved watching all the TV crime story shows, both real and scripted. She
  thought it wouldn't be too hard to get away with some of the crimes she watched
  on TV - especially kidnaping. She even kept a roll of duct tape with her, hooked
  onto her rubbish bin that she pushed around the building as part of her fantasy.
  She could explain away the tape as part of her �tools�, in case she was ever
  confronted. The thought of this would make her purr and grind against her jeans,
  but she had always thought of the action as simply a fantasy until this Friday
  night. 
Thomas had seen all the cleaning crew before, but he never really took note
  of them. He had sort of noticed the pretty, tall girl who had started working
  over the last several weeks but never really took a good look. Tonight he was
  finalizing some figures to be presented on Monday so he grunted when Mina said
  a friendly �Hello� as she came in to clean the office. 
Mina was really ticked off when the guy sitting at his computer barely even
  acknowledged she was breathing. God damn it, she had said �Hello�. It didn't
  take much effort to be nice, she thought, and this guy never made the effort,
  not even once. She remembered from a previous night that she was a good 4-5
  inches taller than he, and that she probably weighed just about as much. 
Her anger soon boiled over (�...who does he think he is, is he better than
  me? I don't think so...�) and as she came to empty the bin behind him (Thomas
  was completely oblivious to her presence). She grabbed her duct tape, pulled
  a 3' length, attached one end of the length to the top of his chair (�Damn
  him, he still ignores me!�) and jammed his head into his keyboard. With the
  surprise of the move and size at her advantage, she quickly grabbed his left
  arm, pinned it behind him and before he could recover from disbelief of the
  situation she had both hands behind his back and his face forced into the keyboard.
  With the agility she possessed she quickly snatched the strand of tape and
  wound it around his wrists, which she was able to control with her left hand
  alone. This was happening really fast but the exhilaration was incredible.
  Before she could even think her instincts had taken over, grabbing another
  length of duct tape and wrapping it again around his wrists, even tighter this
  time. She grabbed a the roll, pulled a bit away from the rest and quickly pulled
  it across his mouth, wrapping again and again around his head until his incredulous
  screams were stifled. She then pulled him out of his chair, sat on him and
  taped his ankles together tightly. She was breathing very heavily as adrenaline
  coursed through her veins. 
Thomas was angry and shaken, what the hell was going on? He was typing away
  at his report when suddenly this bitch pushed his head down and before he understood
  the situation he was taped up. Well, he would soon take these bits of tape
  off and kick this little girl's ass! Whatever game she was playing he was sure
  the police would not be amused. The problem was, as she sat on him, he realized
  just how much bigger she was than he, and that perhaps getting loose wasn't
  going to be so easy. 
Mina had to think, what was her next move? Why had she done this - she was
  such a hot-head, she scolded herself. While she was thinking she absent-mindedly
  wrapped more duct tape above and below his knees and then sat him up and wound
  more duct tape across his chest, pinning his arms. She then wanted him completely
  immobile, so she encircled his wrists and attached them to his waist by wrapping
  again and again. She knew he had looked at her but she decided to put tape
  across his eyes to effectively blindfold him as well. She then stood up and
  in response, with no support her captive fell back to the floor. 
Thomas sagged back to the floor, now quite scared. The cleaning woman had
  overpowered him and taped him up so quickly that it just now occurred to him
  that she was perhaps robbing him and his office - although burglarizing the
  office would only yield a few aging computers and a plotter that might garner
  a few thousand on the black market. 
Mina sighed and gathered her thoughts. The rest of the crew were on the floors
  above but the vacuum guy would be on this floor soon. She was still stunned
  at the events but was really quite moist from the, well, attack. She only now
  began to scheme her next moves. Grabbing another length off the tape roll she
  wrapped one end across the man's wrists, and then pulled his ankles up towards
  his wrists and wrapped them, very tightly. Mina then wheeled her rubbish bin
  over to the captive and tipped it on its side. Dragging him into the bin proved
  no problem (�He's so light!� she thought) Mina pushed him to the bottom of
  the bin and cover him up with a lot of bags from the previous rooms she had
  cleaned. She then turned on her portable radio to drown out any potential muffled
  screams and carried on cleaning the rest of the floor. 
Thomas was struggling to breathe, but realized that the bigger the breath,
  the stronger the odor of rubbish so he kept his breathing shallow. He was certainly
  trussed up tight and couldn't get comfortable, half-propped against the side
  of what he assumed to be the trash container the bitch pushed around. What
  the hell was she doing, kidnaping him? He hoped his bitch Amazon captor would
  not get to annoyed that he had no family to pay a ransom, if that was the angle. 
Mina stuffed her bin up with trash (easily filled with a tied-up captive as
  part of her luggage) and took her bin outside to dump. She rolled the bin to
  the dumpster and threw bag after bag of garbage into the large metal container.
  She looked around and, upon seeing noone else around, she scooted the trash
  barrel over to her vehicle. She popped open her trunk and quickly yanked her
  prey out of the bin and carried him into his new, temporary home. She flipped
  him over onto his stomach, checked the bonds, took another length of tape and
  wrapped his wrists for good measure. Mina then nestled her captive amongst
  the boxes and battery charging cables present in the trunk, and covered him
  with a dirty blanket she had, tucking it underneath his head and feet to further
  restrict his movement - then closed down the lid. She stowed the bin back into
  the building, made an excuse to her aunt for leaving early and jumped into
  her car and left, captive in trunk. 
Her family had a crappy old mobile home in the sticks that no one ever visited
  anymore; no one until tonight that is. Mina unbuttoned her blouse a bit to
  gain access to her nipples - she tweaked them for a little thrill. She then
  unzipped her jeans and rubbed herself just because she could. As the junker
  she drove bounced along the empty road, Mina heard frustrated but stifled screaming
  coming from the back of her car. She knew she was the bigger, the stronger
  and the captor; he was her slave, her prisoner. Humiliation was certainly in
  the cards, he would be taught to respect her. She almost came at she thought
  of her next moves with her bound up, helpless prize.
