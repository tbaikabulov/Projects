The Story of Victoria and Her New Life



Once upon a time, there was a beautiful girl whom by her own accounting was an angelic picture of innocence and sheer delight.&nbsp; In fairness, by some accords she was just that bringing smirks and bouts of laughter by her antics when spending those rare moments in public.&nbsp; However, a few knew truly the real girl hiding deep inside the veils that hide her true tapestry that entwined the fabrics of her internal landscape.



It is upon one of those rare moments that the girl, whom we shall call Victoria, was out about visiting in one of the few local establishments that she frequented, that we shall pick up the tale of this story. Victoria was in a particularly spirited mood and having yet to be claimed by any of the fine Men that thrived about, was off for an evening of eyelash batting and innocent innuendos.



Finding the girly girls that usually spent most of my free time with when ventured out into the public forum, sliding&nbsp; in between a couple, eyes flashing the glint of something as spread out the �mwahs� to those whom adored. 



�So Miss Victoria how are you? �&nbsp; One of my closest friends Susan asked.



With a half smile, half smirk lowering the long sable lashes, �am just fabulous, thank you, and yourself?�



The conversation stopping as the girls looked towards me; knowing the aria in my voice, the look, the smirk was not an angelic one. �Uh oh.� was said in unison by a number of the girls.



�Uh oh? Why?� The grin never leaving the soft rounded pouty lips canting my head to look up to my friends giving them more reason to worry with the sparkle held in my expressive eyes.



�Oh yes, definitely uh oh�� Susan replied.



Tossing my head back laughing watching my friends as they start to let their own devilish grins appear. Feeling a bit precocious, I let my caramel colored eyes scan the room looking about for one that may be the victim so to speak of the eyelash-batting escapade. Stopping upon One had watched, seen and spoken with many times in the past. One that always made me blush just to gaze upon Him. One that seemed to astound me. Moreover, One that was a safe target knowing He would never cross the line when I should try my witty charms. The look in my eyes seemed to change as the insolent spoiled girl came out. 



�Oh lordy here she goes,� Susan retorted.



Turning to my girl friend, �What?�



�Nothing but swears one of these days the tables are going to be turned upon you Victoria. Then what will you do? Huh?� Susan asked me.



�What ever do you mean Susan?�&nbsp; I looked at her almost daring any that may hear.



�One of these days you are going to torment the wrong Man and He is going to scoop you up turn you over and teach you a lesson. I just hope am here to see it.�&nbsp; Laughing as she retorted back to me.



Susan I knew was right. However, not with this One. He was safe. Had played this dance out with Him countless times always resulting in �one of these days.� 



Watching as the gathering of Men increased, they begin to look about themselves at the young ladies gathered this day edging around to speak with small groups saying hellos. Lowering the long sable lashes as all innocent angels do as they approached; only canting my chin slightly towards Susan revealing the devilish grin as the group made their way to our little foray.



All that came in this little establishment knew that the Men here were different from the men in other establishment. It is why Victoria loved this place so. The Men here were more dominant. More Commanding and powerful. Perhaps not in their respective industries, but certainly as Men themselves. Many women had fallen prey to their charms, melting without hesitation and ability to remain standing before them, becoming consumed by the sheer nature of their intoxicating essence. 



I knew this - I knew that the dance partner I had chosen this evening was perhaps one of those that could charm you with his gentleman appearance, but having glimpsed in words and tones of speech that truly He was more dominant than He let on. Dominant primarily over His own self, Perhaps that was had always excited me about him in the past.



The One Victoria had picked to dance the dance with spoke first, �Greetings girls, Susan, Victoria always nice to see you both.� 



Flashing a smile to Susan before lifting those charming eyes to look up to Him, �evening Mr. Huggalumps Sir.&nbsp; Is such a delight to see you as well.�



A soft gasp escaped every one of my friends. Yes, it was true that I had indeed called many a men, including this Man, some very unusual �pet� names; however, this one seemed a bit over the line even for me. Continuing to flutter the long sable lashes up to Him, waiting for Him to make a move in what I assumed would be a long evening of this darting from one dance step to the other. 



The afterglow of catching Him off guard tingling in my belly, the aria of my voice tantalized Him even further, �Did You know that when You get flustered this little vein starts to throb on the side of Your forehead?� reaching up to show Him on my own forehead where the vein was. It was though the small foray of people gathered all held their breath. The Men all raised their eyebrows at the insolence that I was so known for showing. Susan�s voice was the only one heard as she muttered under her breath �Oh Vicky, oh, oh, oh.�



Before the raised eyebrows on His face could sink in, suddenly feeling the tight clasp of a strong, firm grip reach out grasping my own delicate wrist hard, pulling me up from my seat towards His towering stature.



�Did you say something Miss Victoria?� the icy cold steel blue eyes felt as though they were piercing into me. Suddenly realizing that I had most definitely pushed too far this time. 



�Um um just hello Sir,� batting my lashes as I always did to charm myself out of troubled corners I often found myself.



�Uh huh. You know little one, you have pushed a bit too far many times before and many times before you were only warned.� The dark deepness of His voice seemed to send a shiver to course every vein of my fibers.



Tugging at my wrist that He held so very firmly, �Ok I am sorry but let go of my wrist now. You are hurting me.� starting to whimper attempting that tact upon Him.&nbsp; Tossing His head back in a fit of laughter, �Oh little one you have no idea what pain is.� Even as He laughed, the firmness of His grip if anything tightened more, rather than released. 



�How about you and I take a bit of a stroll little one? What do you say to that idea? Hmmm.� 



�I think that I should like to stay here. You don�t seem to be in a very sociable mood tonight Sir.� The change in His tone and demeanor catching me completely off guard, Finding myself a bit flustered and unable to completely catch my breath being so close to Him. This was a new experience. Never allowing any to even step near this invisible line I had always set up, yet, now it felt like He had grabbed my wrist and plopped me over to His side. 



�Well little one, I have decided that you and I are going to finish the dance you wished to have tonight, so say your good evenings.� Staring up at Him in complete disbelief, eyes widening at every moment as His smile seemed to glow in a newfound energy. 



�But, I�.� Interrupting the endless round of toy excuses, He knew I would attempt to make. �Miss Victoria and I wish everyone a pleasant evening; we have some business to take care of.� The other Men that were standing in the foray all seemed to be laughing and wishing Him well with the tiger cat of all felines. The girls, even Susan seemed to hush in a silence, not daring to speak.



Leaning down whispering a warm breath across my ear, �little one be a lady and don�t fight me or I will not hesitate to stop right here in the middle of the room and put you over my knee. Do you understand me?�



Gasping at the mere suggestion that He would even think to spank my bottom, let alone in public, turning my head glaring up to Him; Starting to part my lips to graze harsh words of how dare You back to Him, seeing the set of His jaw line and the steely gaze, clasped my lips tightly together staying very quiet, very unlike my normal being.



My mind starting to reel with such strange thoughts. Thoughts of how it felt to feel the warmth of His breath upon my neck. The thought&nbsp; of His steel gaze on my tiny stature. These shook me, resolving to clear my head of such nonsense, and begin to develop my own plan to talk myself way out of this corner I seemed to have worked myself into.



�Where are you taking me?� I retorted.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Looking down at me, He smiled. His own thought of having waited a very long time to feel the smooth round flesh of my bottom against the palm of His hand. Thoughts of taking the very breath of my fiery spirit deep into His own lungs through a long drawn out kiss. Shaking His own head knowing the romantic ideas of me being a submissive to His needs were not going to aide Him in gaining my attentions.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



�I do not believe I gave you permission to speak little one,� was His only reply.



�What? Permission to speak. You think I am going to ask You for permission to speak?� His grasp on my wrist tightened as He whipped me around to press the hardness of His chest against my tiny stature. Reaching down grabbing my chin in His hand, forcing me to look up into His eyes. Holding my gaze for the longest moment, searching probing my soul. 



�No, actually I expect you to beg me to allow you to speak,� he replied.



Catching my breath the conflicting feelings inside me almost overwhelming. How could a Man cause me to want to kick him, yet at the same moment my head scream kiss me please. How is that possible? He infuriates me, yet, my belly like a thousand butterflies taking flight, fluttering wings. Without another word spoken feeling His hand let go of my chin, turning me back to continue down the hallway in silence.



Not sure or understanding why, I remained silent the entire walk until we reached a door towards the end of the hallway marked with His initials. Realizing suddenly that He was a regular here and kept a private room for the escapades, He may wish to endeavor in at any moment. Inside finally letting my wrist go as He shut door and locked it taking the key to His pocket turning back to gaze upon me.





A different sort of gaze, feeling as though with His eyes every fabric of clothing was being stripped from me. Leaving me naked and bare. �Now Victoria, lets recap shall we. You have in the past called me many things that were most definitely inappropriate. You have taunted with your charms. You have even gone so far as spray me with that lovely perfume that you wear. Am I missing anything?�



Unsure if should remind him of a few of the other dances we have danced, deciding I was in enough trouble as it was simply looked up at His overwhelmingly tall stature compared to my tiny 5�4� stature not saying a word.



The smirk on His face told all I needed to know. �Well then little one it is my opinion that you are a spoiled little princess who needs to be taught it is not nice to tease and taunt. Nor is it nice to disrespect me in particular since in the past I have done nothing but be a perfect gentleman with you.�



�What do you want? For me to say sorry? Ok am sorry. Better.� Finding myself backing up from Him.&nbsp; With each step He moved closer towards me.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



Laughing he spoke, �no little one if all I wanted was an �I am sorry� do you think I would have brought you here? On the other hand, perhaps that is the problem. What you really wanted was for me to pull your pants down out there in front of our friends and spank that cute little ass of yours so that you could not sit down for the rest of the evening. Is that it Victoria? Are you really just an exhibitionist wench?� 



With each word stepping closer and closer to me until finally forcing me back against a wall. Both His arms outreaching, capturing me between them.&nbsp; Forcing me to look straight up into His eyes. The steel icy changing to a softer ocean blue, floating me in their pools. Wait did he just call me a wench. Ohhh I am suppose to be angry with Him, not be melting at His voice.



�I am waiting for an answer Victoria,� He broke the thoughts racing in my mind.



Finding swallowing difficult, finding the mere ability to take a deep breath difficult, desperate to reply to Him. Desperate to come up with a smart-ass answer to slip from His grasps again as I always did; but finding the task almost impossible being so close to Him. Wishing to put space between us. Knowing that the air would cool my suddenly heated flesh. Were my cheeks blushing? Can He tell?



�Well with your silence I will have to assume then that you would have preferred to have me take your punishment out in front of your friends.� Grasping my wrist again starts to drag me back towards the door. 



Fear striking my insides the noise of whimpering and crying slip out, �no no, please.�



Stopping short of the door looking down at her, �No what?�



�No does not wish to have you spank me out there,� whispered.



�Better. Next time answer me when I ask you a question without hesitating and it is No Sir. Understand?� He calmly spoke.



�Yes Sir,� whispered from my lips.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Giving into His own need for a moment reaches out letting His thumbs touch across her cheekbones. Letting the feeling of her soft skin fill Him. Relishing touching of His rough thumbs as they drag across her. Catching the look in her eyes, seeing the icy cold defiance begin to melt away with each step. Slow and methodical. That is how He had planned it from the start. Take her slowly and she will beg eventually. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



�Victoria you do know I have to spank you. So make it simpler for us both.&nbsp; Drop your skirt and willingly lay over my knee,� His voice so intoxicating as it spoke to me.



Gasping aloud at the thought even being suggested that I would ever allow someone to spank me. Let alone willingly participate. Standing my ground, looking up at Him, brazenly daring Him to touch me again.



�Have it your way Victoria.� A very monotone voice echoed out as His hand darted out grabbing my wrist again dragging me across the floor towards the large chair. Panic striking, having never even as a child had been spanked, starting to scream and holler. Sure, that someone would hear and burst through the door to rescue me from this � this �. This what. A man that is making my insides flutters with every word, every action.



Kicking and screaming, His hands firmly pull me across His lap.&nbsp; Pushing my skirt up around my belly revealing the pink satin ruffles that made up the triangle of my panties. A smile I could not see crossed His lips. His hands slowly caressing every inch of my flesh. 



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Having thought of doing this each time He had seen her. He was going to take His time. Enjoy the sensations. Enjoy her scent. Enjoy the delightful squirming. Unable to restrain Himself desperately wanting to feel the heat of His hand across the soft milky white flesh, he pulled and tugged at the satin hearing it tear from her waist. Before even the first whimper of protest could escape her lips, His large hand found its mark stinging a burn so deep inside of her that He could not hear a breath. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



My mind reeling feeling the fire of His hand, tears welling up in my eyes. Before able to scream at Him, another hard slap was felt against my cheek. The warming sensation filtering down to her folds. Feeling my cheeks begin to burn a crimson to match as realized was becoming wet from His hand spanking my bottom. Repeatedly His hand struck my bottom. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pausing to see if what He had believed from the start was true, He slipped His hand across the heat down between her thighs feeling the moisture, He inhaled deeply mouthing the words thank you to the Gods.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the touch of His fingers across my wetness, the squirming stopped against Him, and my breath became caught in my throat. What is He doing? Oh inside please. My mind begging but my lips remaining steadfastly closed. Acutely slow His fingers dragged across the most sensitive parts of my fold back to my bottom. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Realizing now that she was His for the taking.&nbsp; He can break the brat with out breaking the feisty spirit. His hand came down hard repeatedly on her bottom leaving the prints as reminders. To His delight the squirming started, then subdued and turned to sobbing. Hearing the change, His hand gave one last final hard crack down before pushing her from His lap to her knees in front of Him. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Still sobbing, more from being ashamed that was spanked in the first place, than the heat or pain of the ordeal. Not daring to look up at Him, my eyes found themselves staring down upon my own fingers playing with each other. Only stopping to reach up and wipe the free falling tears from my cheeks. 



Placing his fingers beneath my chin lifting it upwards to Him, He looked at the beautiful sight in His eyes. �Now now little one, that was not that bad was it?� He asked.



Unsure of the proper reply but desperately wanting to get it right for some reason whispered, �No Sir.�



Smiling seeing the surrender of the brat already beginning to take place. �From now on little one, you will call me Master.� 



Without giving me a moment to reply, His hands cupped my delicate features pulling my face to His enveloping me in the kiss it seemed both had so long awaited for. Probing me, enrapturing me, and capturing me.&nbsp; Claiming what He wanted and intended upon having now.













Chapter 2

Still whimpering softly after the first experience of being with �Master�, my cheeks flushed and still feeling the heat of His palm print burning into the milky white flesh of my rump. �Master� said it made me suppler. Unsure of the pain and humiliation of being spanked causing anything more than pain, only knowing is captivated and enthralled with the overwhelming strength of His voice, His eyes, and His hands. 

Rolling across the satin coverlet of the bed, relishing in the thoughts of the hours before, His commanding presence still lingering upon me heavily. His blistering gaze searing the soft flesh that incited a wild throbbing deep within, twisting and turning against the silken coverlet, a soft cry of longing escapes my lush lips. Catching my breath, remembering the ravishment felt across every inch of my frame every time His dark pools fell across my stature, Remembering how senses become painfully, yet, blissfully acute. My heart beat like a single beat echoing out an eerie cadence. 

My own fingers starting to touch across my flesh becoming dangerously wild and sensually roaming at will across the rose tipped nipples. The feeling of desperation encompassing once more as rolls the still sensitive nipples between my digits. Closing my eyes remembering the hot darkness of His gaze pinning me, a savage insistence inside pushing me further. The simmering inside of molten heat assaulted by the raw unbridled feelings He roused turning the fire within to a liquid molten larva. 

Fingertips hungrily graze shooting arrows of pleasure downward to the moist feminine center as wild brown tresses splay across the pillow laden with perspiration. Arching back into the softness of satin beneath bores out a cry for fulfillment, remembering the simple touch of His lips feeling hotter than the sun upon my bare skin. Begins to writhe with a frenzied need of Him once more, sensations course through my hips undulating them higher and higher releasing shudders. A whimper of ecstasy as the words of His promised return lay upon me like poetry, dark, sensual, and arousing. 

The animal heat radiating as strokes across my tender flesh, playing over the taunt nipples, tormenting them. My skin feeling too tight, too sensitive, too open, the ache He left within unbearable. His male musk essence intoxicating to breathe in lingers in the air as starts to shake with desire. A feverish swell so hot wavers between illusion and awareness. Arches desperately seeking the exquisite relief, knowing though only His touch will bring it. Shuddering lifting my hips higher begging in whimpers the need. Wet, white heat within scalding as my pulse races, blood pounding at the hot voluptuous sensations even my own tiny digits create across thrusting hips to my trembling belly. A rush of sensation ruthlessly intensified wildly with the excitement of earlier and the promise of later. Edges upon erupting in pulsating spasms through the heat of vitality and danger, still unable to abate the carnal animalistic cravings, my pink tongue darts outward in fierce hunger across the now parched lips. Long lashes flutter upwards a gullustic moan flies into the air. Hips rock hungrily taking up a natural rhythm, needs now an evident desperation. Silken waves come to lap across the overheated skin a blazed in a passionate dance. Dangling upon the edge, riveted in the moment of culmination. 

Opening my eyes as colors start to swirl as hovers upon the edge of sating my own beast within, only to see His dark gaze riveted back upon me. 

Chapter 3

My tiny stature freezing still, eyes widening as suckles in my lower lip unsure of what His reaction would be towards the state has found me in. Not daring to barely breathe inwards, waiting the endless moment as His eyes bore into me. Was it anger or enjoyment that caused the twinkle in the deep pools? My heart nearly imploding, willing Him to speak with each beat. Unable to stand the silence of another heartbeat, �Master your back.�

�That I am. It seems you have found a way to entertain yourself while I was gone. This what you do all those hours you spend alone, is it?� His voice in that unusual tone had not heard before earlier.

Finding myself biting harder on my lower lip, pulling my legs up to my chest, as I tug at the satin sheet trying to cover up, feeling ashamed that He would find me in such a state. Yet ,the burn and itch insisting on being assuaged. 

�I will take the silence as my answer to be yes. Well it seems that we will have to find some other way to entertain you while I am away my pet, won�t we?�

The tone in His voice hovering between a sadistic sinister tone and one of sarcastic amusement as He spoke. Either one, not sure liked. Earlier it had been a wonderful enchanting time of masterful romantic love. The dominance showed a gentle loving one, enchanting my very soul. It seems the Man had changed in His short time away. Changing to someone I am so unsure of. Tugging the cover closer, almost like a frightened child, edging back as deep into the mattress as possible. 

Watching His every move as He crossed the room towards His desk bending to open a bottom draw. Wishing He would stand a bit further to the side so that I could see what He was lifting out. My lip becoming swollen from the constant chewing upon it, as struggled to peek from side to side. A curiosity taking over, forgetting the tone of His voice until He turned back towards the bed, dropping something to His pockets, holding a handful of long silken cords that matched perfectly with the satin coverlet, He settled down upon the mattress next to me. Pausing to reach out and grab His drink taking a long swallow, His eyes never leaving mine. Eyes widening with a fear suddenly remembering nothing but the hard spanking across my rump, watching as He replaced the drink and His large hand tugged at the coverlet pulling it from my own, leaving my naked stature open to His view. His hand gently and slowly caressed the plain of my belly sending the tremors within to re-establish them quickly. Dropping my head back into the pillow as the fire that flickered with His appearance reunited itself with His touch. Soft sounds rolling from my lips assuring Him of the needs still felt. 

The softness of His voice, the heat of His breath, the tiny brush of His lips upon my ear causing me to barely be able to concentrate upon His words.

�You know my little one; you need be taught if you need . . . You beg me. You are from this moment on mine - mine to sate - mine to torment - mine to entice - my to tantalize and toy with - mine to love. Mine alone. Do you understand me?�  He spoke with such authority barely requiring a reply from me.  

Scarcely comprehending, whimpering �yes Master�, praying His hand would move lower and sate me now. Create the magic He had earlier; assuage the sweet ache that was consuming me. Still stroking my flesh His hands gently caressing down my petite arms to the wrists, grabbing both within the depths of His palm pulling them over my head. His large frame towering over me, as whispered again into my ear, �that�s it pet let it go�.

My entire being becoming supple, melting to His every movement barely feeling the tug against my wrists as He bound them to the top of the bed. His lips finding their way back to my flesh. The wet, white heat scalding as they dragged down across my chest. Pausing to suckle in each nipple, razing His teeth across them. Moaning at the sharpened pleasure as His hands continued to ravish with tenderness. Bucking in an effort to escape the intensity of it, but the dark velvet voice calming �steady pet steady�. 

Straining against His hand begging in a raspy voice, longing to feel Him inside again. He insisting on touching every inch of the dampened body, over the slender hips, the inner tender flesh of my thighs. A long slow growl hissing out as He only taunted against the hard bud causing the frenzied need to burn. Down His hands moved to the long naked legs sending trembles through as His lips touched across each toe. Unable to fight the tugging at my ankles as He parted them, only arching upwards trying for the heat of His mouth to find its way back to the bud.

Feeling Him stretch back out beside me on the bed, His hand slowly sweeping my body, stroking, cupping my breast. Flinching at the touches, His lips pressuring down, enveloping my nipple again. Pulling, tugging at it with His teeth before releasing the hardness, His breath taunting �easy pet�. His words hitting my ears now as sharp agonizing pain clamped shut around the hardness. Gasping, bucking at the sensation only, the constant whisper of His breathes able to settle my insides. The heat of His mouth followed again by searing pain repeating itself. The intensity of each new pleasure and pain heard in the raspy breathes inhaled. Unsure now what was pain and what was pleasure, the line seeming to waver. 

His hand gently caressing across my belly again, feeling each rib as it juts outward, cooling the over heated flesh, calming it with His strength. Trying desperately to grasp reality again when His thumb finds its way to my clit, brushing across it before rolling it hard. Thrusting my hips upward for the pressure that is ruthlessly intensifying to sate the fire. Then an endless moment of nothing. Only feeling the biting pain clutching each nipple. Opening my eyes looking up towards Him seeing Him sitting up with a glass pausing to take a drink. My head falling back to the pillow as the bounds of my wrists and ankles become acutely aware. Tugging hard to free myself only to find with each tug the binding constricting harder. Tears filling my eyes as open them to look at Him. The need so desperately evident as growls �bastard� to Him. Seeing the smirk on His face as watches Him take another large gulp of whatever was in the glass catching the ice between His teeth. My eyes widen as He makes it obvious the large cube held. Only able to gasp as the sudden cold against the hard nub as it is dragged down to the folds. Each flicker only tormenting me further as feels suddenly the heat of His mouth hard upon me, opening the folds. The icy cold thrust deep inside the molten larva yet the heat of His mouth, His tongue darting dancing with the ice. His mouth suckling hard to capture each droplet of moisture. His teeth razing hard the nub, the clenching of my insides around the cube and His tongue urging Him to further assault my insides. 

Everything blurring as screams, each spasm wracking my tiny frame. Shaking, tensing, turbulently and violently spasms wrack through me. A searing lightning bolt sears my insides as feels the biting clamps tear from the hard nipples sending me over the edge to drown in a pool of waves crashing down. His mouth savagely assaulting my private folds as fire mixes with ice, drinking both from me. Delirious sounds escape as begins to surface back opening my eyes to see His pools looking down at me. �Sleep pet�. 

Letting my lashes fall closed unable to keep them open as the sated fibers of my being collapse in sheer exhaustion of the overwhelming climax. 










Chapter 4

Opening my eyes slightly as the rough palms of a hand starts to touch across my cheek.  His thumb gently swiping my cheek bone like a doting parent looking at a child that so adores.  Inhaling deeply, forgetting the binds that hold my wrists tightly down, trying to reach back out to touch my own fingers across His face.  The reality of my situation coming back full force into my consciousness, starting to part my lips to speak, as though His pools could read my thoughts and reactions even before I could myself, He leaned down crushing my lips with His.  Sucking the breath from me before filling my lungs with His own warm breath.  Over and over again filling me with His air as His lips ravished my own.  Catching my anger off guard recoiling it back to the submissive state He had found earlier.  The deeper His tongue probed, the deeper I felt myself melting craving Him to go further.  Take me deeper forgetting all thoughts of rebellion and anger.  Finally, He pulled back gazing down at me, �morning my pet.  Did you sleep well?�

�Yes Master,� was all that slipped from my lips.

His smile at my answer causing my heart to jump skipping beats.  Having seen that smile before many times in the past when a friend of mine would do something as simple as bring her Man a drink.  Had always wondered what that special smile was.  Wanting to see it more often shown to me, I started to speak again.

�Shhhh pet.  I have some business to tend to this morning.�  The quirking smirk replacing His smile beaming at me, �the last time I left Miss Victoria you had a great difficultly in keeping your thoughts upon me.  So ��

Without finishing His sentence He snatched a small vial of something from the bed stand opening it up dropping a few drops across the bud and folds of my still moist center.  Rubbing them slowly in I started to feel the heat of the oil.  Gasping after a moment as a delightful then burning then biting, what as that oil.  A soft growl slipped from my lips as tried to twist and turn feeling the growing intensity of the itch caused by the oil.  

�Ahhh I see my pet you are feeling the drops.�  His laugh cut deep, but the only thing upon my mind was the fiery itch that needed desperately to be scratched.  Closing my eyes trying to focus on something other than the constant burn, pressing my head hard back into the pillow.  

�Easy pet or will be a long morning.� He chuckled.

Opening my eyes to glare up to Him, seeing the satin blindfold in His hands.  I started to shake my head no as felt Him slip it over my eyes.

�Now, now pet, it has been my experiences that sensory depravation of one sense makes another more acute.  Open your lips pet.� He whispered.

Before could think to clamp them shut, feeling the satin slip between them as a satin cloth in effect gagged my mouth allowing only moans and whimpers to slip past.  Watching as He produced another a satin cloth now unable to see, only feel the constant itch my tiny stature writhing in a need stilling only when the touch of His palms across my nipples caused a gentle flutter to stir.  Slowly toying with my nipple as a lover would until the rose hued tipped became hard.  A soft numbing bit clamped over it.  Not hard enough to be painful only enough to cause me to know at every moment it was there.  His thumb moved across to toy with the other nipple, taking His time to taunt the hardness to come itself without a pinching pressure before the soft bite again was felt.

His breath warm against my ear as the dark voice whispered into my ear.  �Little one think of me while I am gone, think of what I am going to do with your body when I return, think of what you wish for me to do when I return, think of the itch and how you will beg me to assuage it.�

Before I could reply with even a small whimper I heard the door close shut.  Alone unable to move other than to writhe slightly in the bounds.  The constant itch on my mound growing deeper.  Feeling flushed as a tiny trickle of moisture began to dribble down my thigh as the biting of the clamps seemed to connect the itch to my insides.

Repeating to myself relax it will stop soon Victoria.  Please let it stop soon please.  Frantically as it felt worse the more I tried to relax it away, I tore at the binding on my ankles to find some way to rub my thighs together to make it stop.  Unable to find any motion that made it better.  The struggling only causing my skin to form tiny droplets of sweat leaving it a shimmer heated picture.  Pressing my head harder to the pillow arching my back upwards , collapsing back to the bed as the movement stinging a pain to my nipples.  Every movement reminding me constantly of the need to stop the constant itch.

Time seemed to pass increasingly slowly, how long could He leave me like this?  How long will the itch remain.  Please will beg my mind screamed as a stream of drool started to fall from the edges of the gag.  The humiliation forgoing to a aching need for Him to return.  A state of frustration slowly replaced it self with a beastly craving for His return.  Able to suddenly hear the ticking of a clock unaware of before. Serving to remind me of each moment of torture as the sound started to echo out like a counting number.

As time passed the noises escaping becoming a low whimper of cries moistening even the blindfold that took away my sense of time further.  Jumping startled as some sound was heard.  Trying to mumble beneath the gag, �Master�.  Turning my head from side to side trying to ascertain where the sound came from.  Was it Him returning?  �Please� the only muttering inaudibly slipping out.

The depression in the bed telling me someone was there.  But was it Him?  The gurgling behind the gag pleading and begging as tries to arch, writhe towards the depression.  Desperate for someone to end the tormenting itching that consumed me.  A large rough hand began to caress my belly.  Only then realizing it was Him.  His touch unmistakable, burned into my mind and flesh forever.  His hand slowly rubbing tiny circles over my rib cage and then down to my inner thighs.  Avoiding the center of the itch.  A soft humming noise became prevalent in my ears, before it touched across my lips.  The soft smooth plastic trembling my lower lip before it moved painfully slower down my throat.  Each inch it moved my frame arched up to receive it.  My body begging the noise to go lower.  Anything to stop the itch.  His other hand still slowly caressing my flesh feeling the moisture laden skin.  Heating it further as the juices started to flow further mixing with the oil that started the delightful ache.  Each rumbling against my nipple of the soft buzzing noises sending flickers of biting pain downward.  The noises escaping my lips like an aria of a beast in heat trying to escape.  

As the buzzing made its way lower and lower His breath blew across the hard itching nub, a gagged groan filled the air before the buzzing noise became muffled.  Thrusting the vibration deep inside For a moment, laying back against the pillow in a temporary sated state.  The vibrations become harder more defined as the heat of His hand brushed against my thigh relinquishing the desire of need.  Disturbing the tranquility that felt for the glimpse in time.  Re-igniting the fire and itch to a new desperation as writhed in a frenzied need to move the vibration deeper.  

His voice breathed into my ear, �Think of me.�  Again He was gone.  The sound of the door echoing as the buzzing deep inside returned with fever the deep seeded need.  Keeping my tiny stature in a constant state of dangling on the edge.  Screaming behind the gag each wiggle strained the explosion quickly came and went.  Rebuilding as the buzzing vibration was relentless causing my insides to climax over and over and over again.  Without time in between to relax.  Begging for it stop.  Begging for Him to make it stop.  The only thought in my mind is of Him. Of His return. Of His touches.

Chapter 5

What seemed like torturous days to her, but in actuality was only an hour, having no idea that his work was at his desk as he carefully watched over the now completely moisture laden frame on the bed.  Stopping to watch as she turned her head from side to side, seeing the strands of hair lay stuck to the high cheekbones,  each time her hips thrusting higher and higher into the air as the climax held her on edge until the final explosion came through dropping her frame back to the mattress.  

Listening as the noises now coming from her lips a constant murmur of please, begs, and Master.  A nonstop aria crescendo upwards to a clash then back down to a low soft lullaby as the vibrator and oil mixed a magically potion for endless streaming orgasm for the girl he had watched for so long.

Sitting back in his chair, almost as completely mesmerized as Victoria�s eyes seemed to be when he looked upon him, he watched her.  Although, learning from such an earlier stage of the game of life that to Master any other, he must first learn to Master himself completely and wholly.  He had thought until this minx entered his world that he had completely gotten the lesson down.

Nevertheless, here she lie, in his bed, moaning the sounds that for so long had dreamt of hearing come from her lips.  For the first time feeling as though, he himself was not in control of anything.  Only in control of needing.  Needing to touch her slight frame, needing to watch her inhale and exhale, needing to see the defined rise and fall of her chest, he felt as though he needed her.  

Inhaling deeply the exquisite aromas of her sex lingering heavy in the air holding it deep inside before exhaling back out.  He watched seeing the slight frame only begin to spasm involuntarily knowing that it was time to stop.  Knowing any longer would be fruitless, as she had most definitely slipped into the space between the colors.  Setting his pen aside rising crossing to the bed having never truly left her side, slowly slipping the vibrator from her soaked folds,  his fingers slowly touching the slick flesh bringing one to his own mouth relishing in her taste.  Reaching down unleashing her ankles first, he moved up to release her arms allowing her the respite of sleep.  A very peaceful and deep sleep.

Unable to leave her side for long had drawn a bath of steaming hot water earlier knowing now it would be cool enough to slide this most precious girl into, he slipped his own silk pajama pants down lifting her tiny frame easily into his arms catching his own breath as she meowed against him.  Snuggling and nestling against his chest, steadying himself before rising to carry her to the bath. 

Stepping into the still steaming water covered in soft rose petals, he lowered the two of them into the water awakening her senses slowly.  Pulling the satin folds from her eyes seeing them look up to him as the water soothed the stressed muscles.  His thumb touching her cheeks softly playing across the gag not offering for a moment to remove it from her lips,  he so wanted to hear her beg him, so wanted to ravish her lips again, claim her and take her deeply.  However, knowing once he started his lessons would be over, He left the gag.  Her eyes looking up to me with a wideness that showed only a sheer true innocence of what her body was betraying;  An innocence of what she was feeling inside.  So different from what she had ever felt before, no longer fighting against him only closing her eyes as melted back into his chest as his large hands slowly caressed the soap upon her.  

He took his time washing her frame.  Noting every inch of her flesh, every mole, every freckle, every unique dimple, Treasuring the submissiveness and meekness of her frame beneath his touch; finally speaking, �Victoria look up at me.�

A softness in her smile and yet melting his own pools as the gag only seemed to accentuate her trust in him as she did not offer to reach up and touch it herself.  �Victoria you are beautiful, so very beautiful.  From now to forever, you are mine.  I have waited for so very long watching you from afar.  Now you are mine.�  His voice seemed to trail off as tiny droplets feel down her cheeks of a glistening gem crystal tears.  

Reaching upward lowering the soft silk gag, he allowed himself this moment.  Devouring her lips with his own, probing deeply inside the heat of her mouth he took what he wished.  Her very heart with his mouth, ensuring to Victoria that there was no doubt of who had just claimed her.  His lips relentless as they passionately found their mark.

Scooping her to his arms, he carried her to the soft rug pile on the floor and slowly yet with a deliberation of a man with a mission made love to the woman that was claiming him as much as he was her.  There was time for more lessons later.  This was a time to show Victoria his complete adoration of her.  That no matter the lesson he would protect and care for her like no other.  That she could finally let all the walls down and feel safe in secure in the arms of a Man.  Moreover, that Man was him.  

Each flutter inside him matched a flutter of his hand across her skin, bringing them both to a peak even before the moment when the hardness of his cock found what it had been searching for her moist folds.  Stopping to look down into her eyes, watching every shadow dance in them as his cock slowly yet purposefully slid inside her stopping every few seconds before more deliberately entering inside her deeper.  With each deeper push, it was though he was sealing the firmness of his control over her.  She was giving with each thrust a bit more of herself to him.  They both could feel the intensity of the movements.

Holding still inside of her, she started to whisper and before a word could make it to her lips; he crushed them with rapture.  Again, he leaned up looking deeply into her eyes, her lips quivering a bit as tries to speak again.  One more time his mouth ravished her.  Each time her lips began to move he captured them beneath his own completing her surrender to him.  Finally, when his mouth released hers, she stayed silent only enthralled by my smile down to her.  

Dozing slightly with her curled into the crook of his arms, he smiled knowing for sure at this moment he was indeed a happy and satisfied man.  Without waking her, he lifted her carrying the limp frame to his bed covering her almost as though one would a child and slipped out to clear his own head and gather his senses together.  

She would sleep for a while this time, he thought making his way down to the main floor.  Ordering a cup of coffee before heading over to His favorite table.  

�Ahhh look who is back, where is your new little toy?�  A brother in trade asked.

Grinning towards his fellow coffee addict, �Victoria is sound asleep.�

�I do hope you chained the little beast.� he asked.

Just grinning, knowing that later this very day beast would be the farthest adjective used to describe the little sultry submissive now laying asleep in his bed.  









Chapter 4

Opening my eyes slightly as the rough palms of a hand starts to touch across my cheek.  His thumb gently swiping my cheek bone like a doting parent looking at a child that so adores.  Inhaling deeply, forgetting the binds that hold my wrists tightly down, trying to reach back out to touch my own fingers across His face.  The reality of my situation coming back full force into my consciousness, starting to part my lips to speak, as though His pools could read my thoughts and reactions even before I could myself, He leaned down crushing my lips with His.  Sucking the breath from me before filling my lungs with His own warm breath.  Over and over again filling me with His air as His lips ravished my own.  Catching my anger off guard recoiling it back to the submissive state He had found earlier.  The deeper His tongue probed, the deeper I felt myself melting craving Him to go further.  Take me deeper forgetting all thoughts of rebellion and anger.  Finally, He pulled back gazing down at me, �morning my pet.  Did you sleep well?�

�Yes Master,� was all that slipped from my lips.

His smile at my answer causing my heart to jump skipping beats.  Having seen that smile before many times in the past when a friend of mine would do something as simple as bring her Man a drink.  Had always wondered what that special smile was.  Wanting to see it more often shown to me, I started to speak again.

�Shhhh pet.  I have some business to tend to this morning.�  The quirking smirk replacing His smile beaming at me, �the last time I left Miss Victoria you had a great difficultly in keeping your thoughts upon me.  So ��

Without finishing His sentence He snatched a small vial of something from the bed stand opening it up dropping a few drops across the bud and folds of my still moist center.  Rubbing them slowly in I started to feel the heat of the oil.  Gasping after a moment as a delightful then burning then biting, what as that oil.  A soft growl slipped from my lips as tried to twist and turn feeling the growing intensity of the itch caused by the oil.  

�Ahhh I see my pet you are feeling the drops.�  His laugh cut deep, but the only thing upon my mind was the fiery itch that needed desperately to be scratched.  Closing my eyes trying to focus on something other than the constant burn, pressing my head hard back into the pillow.  

�Easy pet or will be a long morning.� He chuckled.

Opening my eyes to glare up to Him, seeing the satin blindfold in His hands.  I started to shake my head no as felt Him slip it over my eyes.

�Now, now pet, it has been my experiences that sensory depravation of one sense makes another more acute.  Open your lips pet.� He whispered.

Before could think to clamp them shut, feeling the satin slip between them as a satin cloth in effect gagged my mouth allowing only moans and whimpers to slip past.  Watching as He produced another a satin cloth now unable to see, only feel the constant itch my tiny stature writhing in a need stilling only when the touch of His palms across my nipples caused a gentle flutter to stir.  Slowly toying with my nipple as a lover would until the rose hued tipped became hard.  A soft numbing bit clamped over it.  Not hard enough to be painful only enough to cause me to know at every moment it was there.  His thumb moved across to toy with the other nipple, taking His time to taunt the hardness to come itself without a pinching pressure before the soft bite again was felt.

His breath warm against my ear as the dark voice whispered into my ear.  �Little one think of me while I am gone, think of what I am going to do with your body when I return, think of what you wish for me to do when I return, think of the itch and how you will beg me to assuage it.�

Before I could reply with even a small whimper I heard the door close shut.  Alone unable to move other than to writhe slightly in the bounds.  The constant itch on my mound growing deeper.  Feeling flushed as a tiny trickle of moisture began to dribble down my thigh as the biting of the clamps seemed to connect the itch to my insides.

Repeating to myself relax it will stop soon Victoria.  Please let it stop soon please.  Frantically as it felt worse the more I tried to relax it away, I tore at the binding on my ankles to find some way to rub my thighs together to make it stop.  Unable to find any motion that made it better.  The struggling only causing my skin to form tiny droplets of sweat leaving it a shimmer heated picture.  Pressing my head harder to the pillow arching my back upwards , collapsing back to the bed as the movement stinging a pain to my nipples.  Every movement reminding me constantly of the need to stop the constant itch.

Time seemed to pass increasingly slowly, how long could He leave me like this?  How long will the itch remain.  Please will beg my mind screamed as a stream of drool started to fall from the edges of the gag.  The humiliation forgoing to a aching need for Him to return.  A state of frustration slowly replaced it self with a beastly craving for His return.  Able to suddenly hear the ticking of a clock unaware of before. Serving to remind me of each moment of torture as the sound started to echo out like a counting number.

As time passed the noises escaping becoming a low whimper of cries moistening even the blindfold that took away my sense of time further.  Jumping startled as some sound was heard.  Trying to mumble beneath the gag, �Master�.  Turning my head from side to side trying to ascertain where the sound came from.  Was it Him returning?  �Please� the only muttering inaudibly slipping out.

The depression in the bed telling me someone was there.  But was it Him?  The gurgling behind the gag pleading and begging as tries to arch, writhe towards the depression.  Desperate for someone to end the tormenting itching that consumed me.  A large rough hand began to caress my belly.  Only then realizing it was Him.  His touch unmistakable, burned into my mind and flesh forever.  His hand slowly rubbing tiny circles over my rib cage and then down to my inner thighs.  Avoiding the center of the itch.  A soft humming noise became prevalent in my ears, before it touched across my lips.  The soft smooth plastic trembling my lower lip before it moved painfully slower down my throat.  Each inch it moved my frame arched up to receive it.  My body begging the noise to go lower.  Anything to stop the itch.  His other hand still slowly caressing my flesh feeling the moisture laden skin.  Heating it further as the juices started to flow further mixing with the oil that started the delightful ache.  Each rumbling against my nipple of the soft buzzing noises sending flickers of biting pain downward.  The noises escaping my lips like an aria of a beast in heat trying to escape.  

As the buzzing made its way lower and lower His breath blew across the hard itching nub, a gagged groan filled the air before the buzzing noise became muffled.  Thrusting the vibration deep inside For a moment, laying back against the pillow in a temporary sated state.  The vibrations become harder more defined as the heat of His hand brushed against my thigh relinquishing the desire of need.  Disturbing the tranquility that felt for the glimpse in time.  Re-igniting the fire and itch to a new desperation as writhed in a frenzied need to move the vibration deeper.  

His voice breathed into my ear, �Think of me.�  Again He was gone.  The sound of the door echoing as the buzzing deep inside returned with fever the deep seeded need.  Keeping my tiny stature in a constant state of dangling on the edge.  Screaming behind the gag each wiggle strained the explosion quickly came and went.  Rebuilding as the buzzing vibration was relentless causing my insides to climax over and over and over again.  Without time in between to relax.  Begging for it stop.  Begging for Him to make it stop.  The only thought in my mind is of Him. Of His return. Of His touches.

Chapter 5

What seemed like torturous days to her, but in actuality was only an hour, having no idea that his work was at his desk as he carefully watched over the now completely moisture laden frame on the bed.  Stopping to watch as she turned her head from side to side, seeing the strands of hair lay stuck to the high cheekbones,  each time her hips thrusting higher and higher into the air as the climax held her on edge until the final explosion came through dropping her frame back to the mattress.  

Listening as the noises now coming from her lips a constant murmur of please, begs, and Master.  A nonstop aria crescendo upwards to a clash then back down to a low soft lullaby as the vibrator and oil mixed a magically potion for endless streaming orgasm for the girl he had watched for so long.

Sitting back in his chair, almost as completely mesmerized as Victoria�s eyes seemed to be when he looked upon him, he watched her.  Although, learning from such an earlier stage of the game of life that to Master any other, he must first learn to Master himself completely and wholly.  He had thought until this minx entered his world that he had completely gotten the lesson down.

Nevertheless, here she lie, in his bed, moaning the sounds that for so long had dreamt of hearing come from her lips.  For the first time feeling as though, he himself was not in control of anything.  Only in control of needing.  Needing to touch her slight frame, needing to watch her inhale and exhale, needing to see the defined rise and fall of her chest, he felt as though he needed her.  

Inhaling deeply the exquisite aromas of her sex lingering heavy in the air holding it deep inside before exhaling back out.  He watched seeing the slight frame only begin to spasm involuntarily knowing that it was time to stop.  Knowing any longer would be fruitless, as she had most definitely slipped into the space between the colors.

Unable to leave her side for long had drawn a bath of steaming hot water earlier knowing now it would be cool enough to slide this most precious girl into, he slipped his own silk pajama pants down lifting her tiny frame easily into his arms catching his own breath as she meowed against him.

Stepping into the still steaming water covered in soft rose petals, he lowered the two of them into the water awakening her senses slowly.  Pulling the satin folds from her eyes seeing them look up to him as the water soothed the stressed muscles.  His thumb touching her cheeks softly playing across the gag not offering for a moment to remove it from her lips,  he so wanted to hear her beg him, so wanted to ravish her lips again, claim her and take her deeply.  However, knowing once he started his lessons would be over, He left the gag.  Her eyes looking up to me with a wideness that showed only a sheer true innocence of what her body was betraying;  An innocence of what she was feeling inside.

A softness in her smile and yet melting his own pools as the gag only seemed to accentuate her trust in him as she did not offer to reach up and touch it herself.  �Victoria you are beautiful, so very beautiful.  From now to forever, you are mine.  I have waited for so very long watching you from afar.  Now you are mine.�  His voice seemed to trail off as tiny droplets feel down her cheeks of a glistening gem crystal tears.  

Reaching upward lowering the soft silk gag, he allowed himself this moment.  Devouring her lips with his own, probing deeply inside the heat of her mouth he took what he wished.  Her very heart with his mouth, ensuring to Victoria that there was no doubt of who had just claimed her.  His lips relentless as they passionately found their mark.

�Ahhh look who is back, where is your new little toy?�  A brother in trade asked.

Grinning towards his fellow coffee addict, �Victoria is sound asleep.�

�I do hope you chained the little beast.� he asked.

Just grinning, knowing that later this very day beast would be the farthest adjective used to describe the little sultry submissive now laying asleep in his bed.
