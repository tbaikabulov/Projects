Synopsis:  A story about a man who was not actually an assassin. 






Chapter 1- Jessica

&nbsp; James Griffin liked his job very much. Actually, he loved it. This was the kind of job he had dreamed of since he was a child. He enjoyed the thrill it gave him, the sense of domination, and of course, the risk. He enjoyed feeling the adrenaline pumping through his veins, and the hidden eroticism.
&nbsp; Most of the time, he worked alone. His associate was a bit queasy about certain practical aspects. James didn&#8217;t mind that. He liked working alone. 
&nbsp; It was Tuesday, the 7th of August, 2007. James Griffin had a special work to do, and he was determined to do it well. There were some financial problems, which he hoped to solve with the money from this job.
&nbsp; Waiting on the 8th floor, at the end of the corridor, James saw her as she came out of the elevator. Her name was Jessica Somers, 27 year old attorney from Chicago. The woman looked exactly like the pictures he had seen of her. Beautiful, confident, arrogant. A young woman obsessed with her job. She turned gracefully on her heels and headed to her small office. James was sure that she would not have noticed him even if he was dressed as Santa Claus. He put the mask on and followed her. Her clicking heels drowned the sound of his steps completely. He aimed. 
&nbsp; The bat hit her left shoulder. She staggered, then dropped on her knees. A faint cry of surprise escaped her lips. She tried to look back, but the intense pain knocked her out. 
&nbsp; James stared at the unconscious woman for a moment, as if uncertain what to do next. He shook his head, stashed the bat behind a potted palm, then nervously removed his mask and gloves. After throwing them into the nearby bin, he hurried down the stairs.
&nbsp; A minute later, he walked calmly out of the building. Something urged him to stop. He couldn&#8217;t tell what it was, but it was irresistible. He cursed, then made his way back into the building.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; Jessica Somers was lying motionless, crumpled in a fetal position. No one had found her yet. James crouched beside her and checked her carotid pulse. She was alive. He sighed and was about to stand up when her eyelid fluttered. Then, her terrified eyes fixed on him.
&nbsp; �Oh, dear! What has happened to me?� 
&nbsp; James felt the blood draining from his face.
&nbsp; �I � I saw you sprawled on the floor and��
&nbsp; �It was like a bolt out of the blue. I felt a terrible pain in the left side of my body,� she said with trembling voice, �like an axe splitting me.�
&nbsp; �Do you feel better now?� James asked worriedly.
&nbsp; �It still hurts like hell, and I can&#8217;t move my left arm.�
&nbsp; He helped her sit up, then looked at the grotesque droop of her left shoulder. 
&nbsp; �I can barely move my fingers,� she said with a moan, then rubbed them with her other hand. 
&nbsp; �I will call 911,� he said and fumbled for his mobile.
&nbsp; �Oh, gosh, could this be a stroke? Not me!� 
&nbsp; �I think your arm is broken,� he said, wondering if his voice betrays him.
&nbsp; �My arm� broken!� 
&nbsp; �Yes, I am quite sure about that.�
&nbsp; �Someone must have hit me from behind,� she said and cast a puzzled look at him. 
&nbsp; �Sure,� he mumbled. 
&nbsp; �But why would someone do that to me!�
&nbsp; James shrugged and made himself busy, calling 911.
&nbsp; �I have never done any harm to anyone,� she whimpered.
&nbsp; �They are coming,� James said. 
&nbsp; �Nasty, sneaking animals! Why, why?�
&nbsp; For the first time in his career, James was on the verge of loosing his composure. He badly wanted to run away, but he knew that he had to stay. 
&nbsp; The time ticked ever so slowly. Jessica Somers lapsed into silence, staring at her mutilated shoulder, trembling.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; �I could have been killed if you were not here to help me.�
&nbsp; �Please, do not talk like that!�
&nbsp; �Thank you so much!�
&nbsp; Then, finally, the paramedics arrived.










Chapter 2 - Patty

&nbsp; James Griffin parked the car about a mile from the lodge. He got out and took the big black plastic box from the boot. After making sure that nobody had seen him, he set off for the hill he had chosen a couple of days ago. It was situated about two hundred meters from the lodge. When he got there, he hid behind a rock and started assembling the sniper rifle. A minute later, he was ready. 
&nbsp; The report was muffled by the silencer so only James heard it. The bullet hit the satellite dish which was mounted on the roof.&nbsp; It shook and tilted to one side. He rested the rifle on the rock and waited, looking at the lodge.
&nbsp; Half an hour later, the woman came out of the lodge. James recognized her immediately. She was Patty Wilkins, 32 years old journalist. She had a childish appearance, which was enhanced by her petit figure. Her long black hair was tied in a ponytail that was swaying behind her as she walked.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp; James took the rifle, looked through the lens and prepared for the shot. The woman stopped, looking up at the roof. For a moment she hesitated, and then went around the corner. A minute later, she returned, carrying an old wooden ladder. She rested it on the side of the lodge, made sure that it was steady, and started climbing up.
&nbsp; Patty was about to step on the roof when James fired. Wooden splinters burst and scattered in all directions as the bullet hit the base of the ladder. The ladder started to fall. Losing her footing, she fell backwards, letting out a yelp of surprise.
&nbsp; Patty landed on her posterior with a loud thud that James heard clearly. He waited to see what was going to happen next. He wanted to be sure that everything was properly done. The client&#8217;s requirement was simple. It was of great importance that Patty Wilkins should miss the flight tomorrow. James didn't know anything else. He just had to stop her somehow. 
&nbsp; Patty managed to turn on her side, then pulled herself up on her knees. Supporting herself on the wooden siding of the lodge, she slowly stood up. James&#8217;s hopes that she has suffered a broken leg evaporated. She seemed to be dizzy and shocked, but not seriously injured. James cursed. Shooting her was not an option. It was against his personal rules. He was thinking what to do next, when she swayed and collapsed. A minute late, she stopped making any attempts to stand up. 
&nbsp; James took his rifle and headed to the car. Then, he heard her crying for help. He knew that nobody would hear her. The lodge was isolated and not visible from any other dwelling or road.&nbsp; He got to the car and placed the rifle in the trunk, then quickly retraced his steps.
&nbsp; Patty was making an awkward attempt to drag herself to her car. Her legs were not contributing much to the task. They seemed to be almost lifeless. The heels of her boots were ploughing the wet grass. Her face was pale, contorted with effort and pain.
&nbsp; �Oh my God! What has happened to you!� James exclaimed.
&nbsp; Her eyes popped wide open as she saw him, and then a weak smile twitched her lips.
&nbsp; �I fell off the ladder. What a miracle that you heard me! �she moaned.
&nbsp; �I hope there is nothing broken,� he said and kneeled beside her.
&nbsp; �I am not sure, but my bottom hurts terribly. I tried to get to the car but�Please, help me.�
&nbsp; �Maybe you should not be moved.�
&nbsp; �Oh, come on. There is nothing serious, just a bit painful.� 
&nbsp; �Can you move your toes?�
&nbsp; �Yes,� she said and nodded.�
&nbsp; James slipped his hands under her armpits and lifted her up. She tried to steady herself on her wobbly legs, when a sudden spasm racked her hips. She gasped, realizing that her legs refused to support her. 
&nbsp; �I am holding you,� James said and wrapped his arms around her back.
&nbsp; Her full breasts pressed against his chest. He could feel the tenderness of her body and her vulnerability. And he liked helping her.
&nbsp; �I&#8217;m holding you,� he repeated. 










Chapter 3 &#8211; Cast 

&nbsp; It was a long waiting until James was allowed to visit her. The nurse pulled a face as he told her that he was not a relative, then let him in and disappeared down the corridor. 
&nbsp; Patty Wilkins looked different, very different than before. She looked like a person who had suffered a serious injury. Her face was drawn and pale, her eyes a bit unfocused. James was almost sure that she won&#8217;t be able to recognize him. Then, suddenly, she smiled, her eyes clearing a bit.
&nbsp; �My savior,� she uttered.
&nbsp; James felt blood rushing to his cheeks, and bashfully looked away.
&nbsp; �What a pathetic sight, isn&#8217;t it?� she said. 
 He looked at her tortured body, feeling even more confused. She was placed in a huge plaster cast. For what he could see under the hospital gown, the cast covered her hips and waist, and ended just under her breasts. Her bottom was propped up on some kind of plastic device, which seemed to be supporting the cast. The lower part of the gown was barely covering her private parts. Patty&#8217;s legs were in plaster, widely spread and elevated. There was a spreader bar between her ankles. The monstrosity of the cast made her feet look even smaller. They were bare. In fact, they were amazingly bare, contrasting with the whiteness of the plaster. He could see the padded edge of the cast, just above her delicate ankles. 
&nbsp; �Do you feel better?� James asked.
&nbsp; �There is no pain anymore...but it hurts to see this � thing.�
&nbsp; �Have you broken a bone?�
&nbsp; �One of my pelvic bones.�
&nbsp; �Oh, I&#8217;m so sorry!�
&nbsp; �Thank you for bringing me to the hospital. You saved my life.�
&nbsp; James blushed as he remembered what he had done. 
&nbsp; �I might still be lying there if��
&nbsp; �Please stop! I just did what I was supposed to do.�
&nbsp; Patty gave him a charming smile while tugging nervously at the gown. Her hands were moving restlessly as if trying to compensate for the immobility imposed by the cast. Occasionally, she touched the plaster, exploring it.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; �Why don&#8217;t you sit down?� she asked.
&nbsp; James drew up a stool and sat down, eyeing the contraption that was supporting Patty&#8217;s legs. 
&nbsp; �Have you been waiting long?� she asked.
&nbsp; �What?� he said startled.
&nbsp; �The X-raying and the casting process seemed like an eternity to me.�
&nbsp; �Oh, I don&#8217;t mind waiting. I wanted to make sure that you were ok.� 
&nbsp; She nodded and lapsed into silence for a few minutes. Her fingers continued dancing over the cast, while her bare feet were motionless. Slightly bent inward, they appeared lifeless. James wondered if there was a problem with her feet, then directed his attention to her toes. They were tiny and perfectly shaped, with no polish. Her insteps were graciously arched, her sensitive, rosy soles partially visible from his vantage point. Her heels were unnaturally small and nicely rounded.
&nbsp; �I still can&#8217;t move them,� she said with a choked voice.
&nbsp; �Ah, you can&#8217;t move your�?�
&nbsp; �My feet. When the anesthetic wears off, everything will be fine. That&#8217;s what the doctor said.�
&nbsp; �I understand.�
&nbsp; �What were you doing up there, spying on me?�&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp; Boring into him, her eyes were not unfocused anymore.









Chapter 4 - Crystal

&nbsp; Crystal was very angry at her husband. She was so angry that she threatened to leave home and never return. He didn&#8217;t seem to be impressed at all. He said that he refused to pay for absurd luxuries anymore. His smile was driving her crazy, his calm manners even more so. Crystal wondered what was going on with Bobby. The first year of their marriage was perfect, but then� he changed.
&nbsp; Crystal bought a new dress, and immediately felt much better. Then she had coffee with a friend hers, a friend who was a good listener. After sharing her problems with him, she felt well enough to go home. 
&nbsp; It was already dark outside. She looked around for a taxi, but there was none. Her chances of finding one were slim because she was standing on a deserted side street. Across the street was a park, and in the distance, she could see the traffic lights at the end of East Road. She headed in that direction. 
&nbsp; Beyond the arched entrance of the park was a large, stone staircase that was lined with trees and bushes. Two lamps were illuminating the upper part of the staircase. The lower part was in darkness. She could see kids playing among the trees. 
&nbsp; Crystal flipped open her mobile and called her husband.
&nbsp; �Bobby, is the dinner ready yet?�
&nbsp; �I kept my promise, dear,� he answered sweetly.
&nbsp; �Is it eatable?� 
&nbsp; �I hope so,� he said dryly.
&nbsp; �OK, then. I&#8217;m coming.�
&nbsp; Crystal was putting the phone in her purse, when she felt her right high-heel catching on something.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; �What the�� she managed to say and threw out her arms to steady herself. Her right shoe refused to move. She stepped forward with her left foot. Her ankle wobbled and turned. Losing her balance, she tumbled down the stairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 �Oh, my�� she yelped with surprise.
 Crystal found herself lying at the bottom of the stairs. Everything was dark around her; coldness was creeping up her spine. She propped up on her elbows and cursed. Her body felt stiff and sore. Somewhere in the distance an owl hooted. She examined her manicure, and noticed a chipped nail. 
&nbsp; �Damn!�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 The next thing she became aware of was the tingling sensation in her feet. She ignored it as she saw the monstrous run in her stocking. It started at her knee and was creeping up her thigh. 
&nbsp; �Ah!� 
&nbsp; Crystal brushed a lock of hair behind her ear and sat up, rummaging in her purse. Her cell phone wasn&#8217;t working. 
&nbsp; �This can&#8217;t be true!�
&nbsp; Then she felt that the straps of her shoes were digging into her ankles. The tingling in her feet was now accompanied with unpleasant throbbing.&nbsp; She moved her feet slightly and gasped with surprise as the pain exploded. The paralyzing feeling spread up her shins. Arching her back, she let out a pitiful wail.
&nbsp; �Heeelp! Please, somebody help me!�
&nbsp; Crystal looked desperately around her, trying to see in the darkness. Nothing. Her cries ripped the silence.
&nbsp; �Ohhh! Ohhh! Something has happened to my leeeegs,� she wailed. 
 Her make-up started to run, but she didn&#8217;t notice. Suddenly, a figure appeared beside her. 
&nbsp; A man voice asked, �Have you hurt yourself?�
&nbsp; �I fell down the stairs,� she said with a sniff,�My legs��
&nbsp; �You will be fine, just calm down.�
&nbsp; He kneeled down and touched her ankles, then fumbled to unbuckle the straps of her shoes.
&nbsp; �Hey, don&#8217;t do that! It hurts,� she pleaded. 
&nbsp; �Your ankles are terribly swollen. I have to take your shoes off.�
&nbsp; �Noooo!�
&nbsp; Despite her protests, he removed the shoes. Crystal filled her lungs with air, preparing to yell. The pain subsided considerably, and she just gasped. 










Chapter 5 &#8211; At Last 

&nbsp; Crystal remembered being placed on a stretcher and carried to the ambulance. She remembered the siren of the ambulance, and the smiling face of a doctor. She also remembered the merciful bliss of drifting into unconsciousness. Everything else was a blur.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; It took her a long time to wake up fully. She felt dizzy and nauseous and her eyelids seemed to be made of lead. At first her mind refused to build up a picture of what had happened. 
&nbsp; Crystal stirred in her bed. The hospital smell was tickling her nose. She opened her eyes to see the white walls of her room. To her great surprise, her legs were also white. Placed in plaster casts, they were elevated in padded slings.
&nbsp; �No, no, no,� she said, trying to deny what her eyes were seeing.
 She could not believe that these were her own legs. Then she saw toes sticking out of the casts. Definitely her toes. She had painted them yesterday. Pulling up her hospital gown, she noticed that the casts encased her legs well above the knees. The plaster was hard and unyielding. She couldn&#8217;t even budge a muscle. Only her toes responded as she tried to wiggle them. Quite stiffly though. 
&nbsp; Crystal grunted angrily and pressed the button beside her bed. A minute later, a nurse appeared, with a well-worn smile pasted on her face.
&nbsp; �Could you please tell me what is going on here?�
&nbsp; �Well, what exactly are you interested in?� the nurse asked amiably.
&nbsp; �What have you done to my legs?�
&nbsp; �Your legs were immobilized with plaster casts. I think you have already noticed that.�
&nbsp; �Why?� Crystal asked timidly, her eyes bulging slightly.
&nbsp; �Tarsal fractures.�
&nbsp; �What!�
&nbsp; �Your ankles are broken.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; Crystal gasped, her eyes popping out with fear.
&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t worry dear, you will be fine in a couple of months,� the nurse said and patted Crystal&#8217;s shoulder.
&nbsp; �I won&#8217;t be able to walk�� Crystal started, staring at her casted legs. 
&nbsp; �I am afraid you are right.�
&nbsp; �But�� she said with choked voice, and her eyes moistened.
&nbsp; �Your husband is here.�
&nbsp; �Bobby! He already knows?�
&nbsp; The nurse nodded. 
&nbsp; �Do I look bad?�
&nbsp; The nurse blinked and looked intently at Crystal.
&nbsp; �You look a bit �tired.�
&nbsp; �Does he worry about me?�
&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll let him in.�
&nbsp; Bobby blushed as he saw his wife. His eyes lingered on the casts, then fixed on Crystal&#8217;s face. 
&nbsp; �What happened, my dear?� he asked and moved closer.
&nbsp; �I tripped on something, Bobby, and fell down the stairs,� she whimpered.
&nbsp; �My poor cutie!�
&nbsp; �My ankles are broken.� 
 He lent down and hugged her. She buried her face into his chest and started to cry bitterly. Rocking her gently, he kissed her neck and sat on the bed. 
 �I am so scared, Bobby.�
 �You will be fine, sweetie.�
 �Take me home! I don&#8217;t like being here.�
 �As soon as possible, I promise.�
 �Please, talk to them, Bobby!�
 �But maybe��
 �Talk to them!�
 �Ok,� Bobby said reluctantly. 

***

&nbsp; Bobby carried his wife over the threshold of their house. He carefully maneuvered his way to the bedroom, doing his best to avoid catching her casted legs on something. Crystal giggled nervously and snuggled against his chest.
&nbsp; �You have carried me like that before,� she said.
&nbsp; Bobby smiled and pecked her cheek, then placed her on the bed.
&nbsp; �I have to prop my legs up. The doctor said that��
&nbsp; He sat beside her and slid his hands under the casts. With an abrupt motion, he lifted her plastered legs and rested them on his shoulders.
&nbsp; �Aaah!� Crystal moaned, her eyes bulging with surprise, pain and barely contained anger.
&nbsp; His lips brushed against her toes, his hands rubbing the hard surface of the casts.
&nbsp; �Bobby, what are you doing? You are hurting me!�
&nbsp; He licked the base of her toes, not bothering to answer.
&nbsp; �Stop it!�
&nbsp; �What cute little tootsies! Trapped in plaster! And no fancy shoes anymore!�
&nbsp; �Please stop, you are scaring me.�
&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t like to be dictated to. Just look at you now! I have waited so long for this moment.�
