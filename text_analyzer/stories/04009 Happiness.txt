*�� *�� Start of Story�� *��
*�� *�� *�� *

&nbsp;

I was tied up - literally.� I was
naked and kneeling and

locked into some kind of strange construction.� My

hands were bound behind me and my mouth was

gagged.� I'm sure I looked a sight.� But Kyra told me

this is what Bill liked, so there I was.� And I didn't

know whether to feel humiliated, or scared, or excited. 

Maybe a little of all three.� I
know part of me was

thinking this was amazingly bizarre.�
But the rest of

me was hoping against hope that this was the answer

I'd been praying for.� Everything
was ready.� Kyra

was going to meet Bill when he got home and bring

him to me.� And oh yeah, my name
is Allie.

&nbsp;

All I really wanted was to make Bill happy.� We had

been married almost a year and I knew that something

was very wrong.� But until I
talked with Kyra, I had

no idea what it might be. . . .�
I suppose I'd better start

at the beginning.

&nbsp;

I first met Bill at a party.� It
wasn't a great 'love-at-

first-sight' moment, but I did find him attractive.� And

it wasn't just physical.� Oh,
Bill was handsome

enough but he wasn't particularly tall.�
That is to say

we're almost exactly the same height.�
But I was very

attracted to his personality.�
And the more we talked

the more I liked him.� He was
smart and attentive and

funny.� He made me laugh and I
liked that a lot.� And

there was something else about him.�
Something I

wasn't able to put my finger on at the time.� But I

think there was a kind of lost puppy-dog quality about

him.� It made me want to take
care of him.� Three

weeks after the party Bill proposed and I didn't have

to think twice before saying 'yes.'

&nbsp;

I suppose you'd call that a whirlwind romance.� So I

didn't really know that much about him.�
But I did

know about Kyra.� She'd been his
long time girlfriend

before me.� In fact, they'd
broken up shortly before

the party.� It had been an
amiable split and they had

stayed good friends.� But there
was nothing more

between them.� Really!� I mean I have never, ever

been bothered by Kyra.� Bill
never gave me any

reason to be and neither did she.�
He didn't talk about

her unless I asked.� And when I
did ask he answered

all of my questions without looking the least bit

evasive.� The only thing he wouldn't
talk about was

their sex life.� At first I
thought he was just being

considerate of Kyra's privacy.

&nbsp;

Bill didn't even invite Kyra to our wedding but I

figured they'd been together for such a long time she

deserved the courtesy.� So I
found her address and

sent her an invitation.� Bill was
a little surprised when

she came to the wedding.� I guess
so was I.� But it was

no problem.� That was the first
time I met her.� She

was half a head shorter then me and quite pretty.� But

there was also something powerful and intimidating

about her.

&nbsp;

Almost surprisingly, Kyra and I became friends.� Not

close friends, but we'd talk from time to time.� And

she never imposed on our marriage.�
She was never a

threat.� She never acted like she
objected to me or that

she had any designs on Bill.� I
really respected her for

that.� And that might have been
all there was to it if

there hadn't been something wrong between Bill and

me.

&nbsp;

Our first year of marriage was good.�
In fact it was

wonderful in most ways.� But
there was definitely

something missing as far as sex was concerned.� I

could never seem to please him.�
Oh, he was good

about it.� He never complained or
asked me for

anything.� But I felt like a
miserable failure.� In fact I

really wished he would have asked for something. 

Maybe that way I would have been able to figure out

what was wrong.� But Bill just
wouldn't talk about it. 

He'd discuss anything else, but not that.

&nbsp;

And I knew the problem wasn't me.�
At least I was

pretty sure it wasn't me.� I'm
not bad looking.� But

looks aside, I really love sex.�
Oh, I know women

aren't supposed to.� At least not
women who have

been properly brought up.� But I
do.� I love it and I'm

responsive, and I'm appreciative.�
I moan and cry out

when making love and I almost always have an

orgasm.� I never have to fake
anything.� Men are

supposed to like that and I'm sure Bill did.� But I just

couldn't do the same for him.�
And it was driving me

crazy.� I finally got the idea of
asking Kyra.� Bill had

once said that sex had been the best part of his

relationship with her.� 

&nbsp;

So I called Kyra and we met for lunch.�
At first I did

most of the talking.� And I kept
talking without

getting to the point.� She didn't
interrupt and she

didn't try to hurry me.� She just
listened.� But I didn't

want to leave without an answer.�
So I finally screwed

up the courage and asked her point blank, &quot;Did you

and Bill have good sex?&quot;

&nbsp;

Kyra gave me the strangest smile like she knew this

was why I'd wanted to meet.�
&quot;Why do you ask?&quot; she

said innocently.

&nbsp;

I don't think she was trying to make me squirm.� I

think she just wanted to be sure of my reasons for

asking before she answered.� But
I couldn't seem to

find the words.� I guess I looked
pathetic.� Anyway,

she finally volunteered an answer.�
&quot;Great.� Our sex

was always great.&quot;� Then she
paused thoughtfully and

went on, &quot;But sex wasn't enough.�
He wanted

something which I couldn't give him, and you

obviously could.&quot;� And as if
to deflect any wounded

feelings she added, &quot;I'm not unhappy about the way

things turned out.� All I ever
wanted was for William

to be happy.� And if he's happy
with you, I'm

satisfied.&quot;

&nbsp;

I stalled.� &quot;What did I have
that you didn't have?� I

mean what was he looking for that I gave him?&quot;

&nbsp;

She gave me another funny, knowing look.� &quot;Oh I

don't know, respectability maybe.�
Or conventionality. 

But that's not why you wanted to talk to me.� So tell

me, why are we here?&quot;

&nbsp;

I couldn't bring myself to put it into words and must

have just looked miserable again.

&nbsp;

&quot;He's not happy, is he?&quot; Kyra asked.� &quot;I mean he may

be happy with you, but there's something missing

when it comes to romance, isn't there?&quot;

&nbsp;

I just nodded.

&nbsp;

&quot;He pleases you, but you can't please him. �Is that

about it?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes,&quot; I admitted with considerable relief.� I was

embarrassed but glad to have it out in the open.� And

I was very encouraged.� Kyra had
guessed what was

wrong.� That would also mean she
knew how to make

things right.� Wouldn't it?

&nbsp;

&quot;You want to please him,&quot; Kyra said, &quot;don't you?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes I do.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;How much?&quot; she asked.

&nbsp;

&quot;I beg your pardon?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;How much do you want to please him?� How far are

you willing to go?�

&nbsp;

What was this?� I had no idea
what she was talking

about.� But I knew Bill's
happiness was my only

concern.� &quot;I'll do whatever
it takes,&quot; I said firmly. 

&quot;As long has he's happy, I'll be happy.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;And you'd do anything to make him happy?&quot; she

asked with that amused expression.

&nbsp;

&quot;Anything!&quot;

&nbsp;

She thought about that for a few silent moments. 

Then she looked at me with a totally new expression. 

It was like a combination of seriousness and

compassion.� &quot;Don't answer
too quickly.� Think about

it.� I'll think it over as
well.� We'll talk again.� And if

you're still this serious, I'll help you with what you

need.&quot;

&nbsp;

And that was the end of lunch.� I
went home baffled

but hopeful.� Bill and I made
love that night but it was

worse than ever.� Sweet,
romantic, and with

absolutely nothing to suggest he was enjoying himself

at all.

&nbsp;

Two weeks passed.� Bill was at
work when the phone

rang.� It was Kyra.� &quot;You still want to know how to

turn William on?�

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes,&quot; I said, &quot;are you going to tell me?&quot;

&nbsp;

By way of answer she said, &quot;He's going out of town

on business soon, isn't he?&quot;

&nbsp;

How did she know that?� &quot;Yes
he is.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;How'd you like to surprise him when he gets back

with something that will make him hotter than you've

ever seen him before?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;You know I would.&quot;

&nbsp;

There was a long, thoughtful pause.�
&quot;And you'll do

whatever it takes?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Anything.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;You've given this careful thought?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes, I have.� Why do you
keep asking me that?� This

isn't going to involve anything dangerous, is it?&quot;

&nbsp;

She laughed.� &quot;That depends
on what you mean by

dangerous.� William and I had
great sex and I'm still

here and in more or less one piece.&quot;

&nbsp;

More mystery.� &quot;Are you
going to tell me?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;No, but I'll show you.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I beg your pardon?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;It's not something I can 'tell' someone with no

experience.� But I'll come over
and help you prepare

a surprise for him on the day he gets back.� I can

guarantee you'll really turn him on.�
Would that be

acceptable?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;You answered too quickly.�
I'm not convinced. . . . 

Would you do exactly what I tell you?�
No questions. 

No arguments.� Just do whatever I
say for the

evening?�

&nbsp;

This was definitely strange, but the whole situation

was strange.� And maybe it was
some kind of test on

her part.� So I said OK.

&nbsp;

Afterwards I wondered what she'd meant by

'someone with no experience.'

&nbsp;

I didn't hear another word from Kyra until the

morning Bill was scheduled to return.�
She called

early and told me to pamper myself.�
She said to go

out and get my hair done, have a manicure, whatever. 

Then I was to take a long hot bath in the evening and

to not get dressed afterwards.�
Just throw on a robe

and be dry and ready for her at 8:00 pm sharp.� That

was only an hour or so before Bill was supposed to

get home.

&nbsp;

&quot;Should I eat first?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Please yourself.&quot;� And
the phone went dead.

&nbsp;

I went through the entire day in a kind of trance

wondering what was going to happen that evening. 

And when the doorbell rang, precisely at 8:00, I was

in quite a state of excitement.�
I hadn't even touched

myself the whole week Bill was away.�
I wanted to be

really ready for him.� And like I
said before, I'm

somewhat oversexed.� I generally
bring myself off at

least once or twice a day when Bill is gone.� So

between my horniness and the mystery I was primed

and ready for anything.� Well, I
thought I was ready

for anything.

&nbsp;

When I opened the door there was a young man with

Kyra.� She called him Rick.� He was tall and blond. 

And he must have been very strong because he was

carrying a large rectangular contraption like it

weighed nothing.� It looked like
a conductor's podium

with a padded top and straps.�
Kyra just smiled at me. 

I pulled my robe tighter and let them in.� She went

directly to the den with the man following.� She

closed blinds, rearranged furniture, and had the man

set the platform down in the middle of the room. 

Then she thanked him, kissed him on the cheek, and

sent him away.

&nbsp;

I breathed a sigh of relief.� I
thought the big secret was

going to involve some kind of three-way sex with the

young stranger.� I wasn't ready
for that.� So maybe I

should have taken Kyra's warnings more seriously. 

What *was* I getting myself into?

&nbsp;

&quot;Let's have a look at you,&quot; she said, after Rick left.

&nbsp;

I was suddenly reluctant, but I removed my robe and

let Kyra appraise me with a critical eye.

&nbsp;

&quot;I can see one of the reasons why William finds you

so desirable.� You've got a much
better body than

mine.&quot;

&nbsp;

That may have been something of an exaggeration, or

perhaps just flattery.� I'm sure
men found her at least

as attractive as they found me.

&nbsp;

&quot;OK,&quot; she said, &quot;we don't have a lot of time so let's

get started.&quot;� She carefully
positioned the podium

thingy and opened up the hinged board at the back. 

The platform was a padded square and the hinged

business on the back was a stock kind of arrangement. 

You know the stocks you see in woodcuts of old time

American punishments.� Pictures
where some guy is

penned up for public humiliation with his head and

hands trapped between two planks of wood with

notches in them?� Well it was
kind of like that, but the

wood was bolted to one side of the platform.

&nbsp;

I swallowed hard and then got down and into position. 

I knelt on the platform and put my ankles in the

notches.� Kyra lowered the top
board and my ankles

were suddenly fixed in place.� I
heard a lock snap

shut.� But the holes were padded
just like the top of

the podium so it wasn't uncomfortable.�
Well, not too

uncomfortable.� 

&nbsp;

I swallowed again and waited to see what came next. 

She cuffed my hands behind my back.�
The cuffs were

padded too.� Then she positioned
my knees so they

were well apart and she strapped each one down to the

platform.� I was totally exposed
and helpless and had

never felt so vulnerable in my life.�
I wanted to ask

what this was all about, but I already had half a

notion.� And besides, I'd
promised, no questions.� A

moment later I couldn't have asked any questions if

I'd wanted to.� She came up
behind me and pinched

my nose closed.� My mouth almost
automatically

opened and with her other hand she pushed some kind

of gag into it.� She buckled the
gag in place behind my

head and then moved around in front of me to have a

look.

&nbsp;

&quot;Beautiful,&quot; She said.�
Then she leaned forward and

kissed me on the forehead.�
&quot;William is going to love

it.&quot;

&nbsp;

That gave me encouragement.�
During the whole time

we'd known each other I had no idea Bill was into this

kind of kinkiness.� But if this
is what it took to really

turn him on, then so be it.� I
just wanted him to be

happy.� He was wonderful and
deserved it.� Besides,

in a very strange way all this was kind of turning me

on as well.

&nbsp;

Kyra rearranged a few other things in the room; she

adjusted the lights.� Then she
glanced at the clock and

walked off to the bathroom.� I
heard her tinkering for

a long time.� A toilet
flushed.� Water ran.� Then

nothing.

&nbsp;

Just as I was starting to get uncomfortable, I heard a

car pull up.� Bill's voice paying
off the taxi driver. 

Footsteps and a key in the front door.

&nbsp;

&quot;Hello, William.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Kyra!� What are you doing
here? . . . Like that?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Don't blame me.� It was
your darling wife's idea.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Allie?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Allie.� You think she
hasn't noticed something

missing in your sex life?�

&nbsp;

Silence.

&nbsp;

&quot;Kyra, listen . . .&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;No William, you listen.�
When you decided to break

things off, I didn't whine and I didn't complain.� I

knew it was a mistake, but I knew you weren't going

to learn until you found out for yourself.� Well it's

been a year now.� Are you happy?�

&nbsp;

Silence.

&nbsp;

&quot;Do you think she's happy?�

&nbsp;

More silence.

&nbsp;

&quot;Well she contacted me and just about demanded to

know what it takes to get you excited.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;And you told her?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Better than that.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Better?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Come.&quot;

&nbsp;

I heard the sound of footsteps approaching.� Kyra

entered first.� I was
startled.� She was wearing some

kind of black leather outfit that left very little to the

imagination.� And there was
something about it that

was almost frightening.� She
looked like the guy in an

old roman movie who flogged slaves.�
And she was

carrying one of those small whips that jockeys use on

horses.

&nbsp;

Bill came in right behind her and didn't seem

surprised at all.� But Kyra was
right.� He looked

hornier than I'd ever seen him.

&nbsp;

Kyra let him look at me for a few moments and then

said, &quot;OK then.� What's it
gonna be?� It's your call

William.� This is Allie's idea,
but it's your decision. 

Do you want me to leave and you can work this out

between yourselves?� Or do you
want me to follow

through?&quot;

&nbsp;

I had no idea what she meant by this, but Bill

obviously did.� He seemed
torn.� He looked into my

eyes.� &quot;You're doing this
for me?&quot;

&nbsp;

I nodded.

&nbsp;

&quot;To make me happy?&quot;

&nbsp;

I nodded again.

&nbsp;

&quot;And you know what you're getting into?&quot;

&nbsp;

I really thought I did so I nodded once more.

&nbsp;

Bill shrugged.� I could see an
enormous bulge in his

pants.� &quot;Well then . . . OK,
Kyra.� You're in charge.&quot;

&nbsp;

That surprised me.� I thought he
was going to tell her

to leave.

&nbsp;

&quot;Strip!&quot;� Kyra said in
a firm tone.� And Bill quickly

removed his clothes.� Who would
have guessed he'd

be turned on this way?� But he
looked great.� His

member was standing harder and firmer than I'd ever

seen it.

&nbsp;

Once he was naked Kyra moved over to him and

grabbed his penis with one hand.�
That made me a

little jealous.� And for the
first time, too.� She began

stroking him and was looking at me.�
&quot;Nice isn't it?&quot;

&nbsp;

I gulped and nodded.

&nbsp;

&quot;You're going to suck this for him, aren't you?&quot;

&nbsp;

I nodded enthusiastically and with relief.� So she was

just there to order us both around.�
I guess Bill was

turned on by strong women.� Well
I was going to be

his strong woman after Kyra was gone.

&nbsp;

She moved toward me pulling Bill along by his penis. 

She put her little whip under my chin and tilted my

head back so that I was looking directly into her eyes. 

&quot;You're going to suck him real good until he cums,

right?&quot;

&nbsp;

I had to swallow hard on that one before I nodded.� I

hated the idea of Bill coming in my mouth.� But if I

needed to do it to satisfy him. . .�
I guess that's why

Kyra was so insistent that I agree to follow all her

directions before she'd help me.

&nbsp;

She released his penis and squatted down by my side. 

She grabbed by chin with one hand and swatted me

very hard on the thigh with her whip.�
I yelped

through my nose with pain and surprise.�
&quot;You're

going to let him cum in your mouth and you're going

to swallow it all down, aren't you?&quot;

&nbsp;

I gulped again and didn't know what to say.� The idea

sickened me.

&nbsp;

She swatted me again with her whip.�
&quot;Aren't you?&quot;

&nbsp;

And I nodded quickly and emphatically.�
I didn't want

to get whipped anymore.

&nbsp;

Kyra held the whip in front of my face.�
&quot;When I take

your gag out all you're going to say is 'please let me

suck your dick Master William.'�
Got it?&quot;

&nbsp;

I quickly nodded.

&nbsp;

�If you say anything else, I'm going to be very

unhappy.� And if I become unhappy
I'm going to start

whipping your tits.&quot;

&nbsp;

I was trembling as she undid the gag.

&nbsp;

&quot;Please let me suck your dick, Master Bill.&quot;

&nbsp;

Kyra swatted my leg again.�
&quot;William!&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Master William,&quot; I corrected.� &quot;Please let me suck

your dick Master William.&quot;

&nbsp;

And Bill stepped forward and put his penis in my

mouth.� His penis isn't that
long, but it's very thick. 

I like it, especially when he's inside of me.� He held

my ears almost like handles and literally started

having intercourse with my mouth.�
I'd always sucked

his penis before.� This was
different.� But he was

definitely hotter than I'd ever seen him.� And

somehow this didn't surprise me.�
What did surprise

me was that while Bill was doing this, Kyra reached

down between my legs and started massaging my

private area.� My first instinct
was to protest, but my

mouth was full.� And besides, I'd
agreed to anything

without question.

&nbsp;

So I continued to lubricate my mouth as best I could

and tried to help as Bill plunged more and more quickly

into me.� And very quickly Kyra
started getting results

from her manipulations.� She was
very good at this. 

I found that I was getting as hot as Bill seemed to be. 

I was thinking that maybe it had been a mistake not to

play with myself for a whole week.�
There was

something about the situation.�
It was weird, but I

couldn't deny my reactions.� I
could feel my cuffed

hands against the base of my spine.�
My armpits were

starting to perspire.� The sounds
of Bill's passion were

thrilling to me.� The feel of his
leg hair against my

breasts was an incredible turn-on.�
I was on the verge

of cumming.

&nbsp;

But Kyra seemed to sense this and stopped what she

was doing.� She pinched one of my
nipples hard.� My

orgasm died before it erupted.� I
was still hot, but I

wasn't about to cum.� But Bill
did.� He exploded in

my mouth.� And it wasn't as bad
as I thought it would

be.� I gulped as quickly as I
could and tried not

thinking about what it was I was swallowing. 

Besides, Kyra had me so horny, I wasn't that bothered

by it.

&nbsp;

After a minute or so, Bill was finished.� His semi-

flaccid penis slipped out from between my lips and he

backed off on trembling legs and fell into a big chair.

&nbsp;

He was happy.� And so was I.� I wasn't sure how all of

this was supposed to work once Kyra was out of the

picture.� But I knew we'd think
of something.

&nbsp;

Kyra had stopped fingering me when Bill had cum. 

But I still hadn't cum and could feel drops of my own

moisture running down the insides of my legs.� Kyra's

hand came up, drenched in my own fluids, and

grasped me with slippery fingers by the chin again.� I

was panting with exertion and lust.�
She held the whip

up in front of my face and then extended one finger

and held it to her lips in a shushing gesture.� &quot;Not a

word.� Understand?&quot;

&nbsp;

I almost said, 'Yes' but instead nodded.

&nbsp;

&quot;Good girl.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Well William?&quot;� Kyra
said.� &quot;It's your call.� Allie

wants you to be happy?&quot;

&nbsp;

Bill looked over at me with more love and

contentment than I'd ever seen in him before.� &quot;Are

you sure?&quot; he asked.

&nbsp;

'Sure about what?' I wondered.�
But I had to make an

answer and I wasn't supposed to talk.�
So I just

nodded again.

&nbsp;

William shrugged and said, &quot;OK, Kyra.� You were

right and I was wrong.� You
win.&quot;

&nbsp;

'Win what?' I wondered.� What
exactly had just

happened?

&nbsp;

Kyra stood up.� &quot;OK . . .
.&quot;� She looked down at me

and holding her whip for me to see said, &quot;Not a

word.&quot;� Then she looked at
Bill and ordered him to,

&quot;Get cleaned up.� It's been
well over a year for you so

I know one little blow job isn't enough.&quot;� They both

laughed.� &quot;Wait for me in
the bedroom and I'll be in

soon and take good care of you.&quot;

&nbsp;

What the hell was this?!�
&quot;But, Bill . . .,&quot; I blurted out.

&nbsp;

A blinding pain came over me as the hot lash of her

whip slashed across my chest.� I
started to scream and

a moment later I felt the gag rammed back in place. 

I tried to fight, but I was helpless.�
But I kept

protesting as best I could.� Kyra
held up the whip

again.� But I didn't stop yelling
behind the gag.� That

is I didn't stop yelling until she started whipping me

some more.� It was horrible.� But I quickly learned and

was silent.� Well, I was crying
and sobbing, but no

longer screaming.

&nbsp;

&quot;Better,&quot; said Kyra.

&nbsp;

Bill was standing at the door and looking back at me. 

Why hadn't he come to my rescue?

&nbsp;

&quot;Get,&quot; said Kyra.�
Bill, looked troubled and undecided

for a moment, but then turned and left.

&nbsp;

I groaned but didn't otherwise protest.

&nbsp;

Kyra got up and looked thoughtfully into my face. 

Then she found her bag and pulled out a cell phone. 

She punched some buttons.�
&quot;OK, Rick&quot; she said.�
&quot;It

looks like we're going to need the van after all. . . . 

Uh huh, same address. . . .&quot;�
She looked back at 

me and then at the clock.�
&quot;Oh, say about half an 

hour. . . .� Right.� I'll let you know where to take her 

when you make the pick-up. . . .�
Bye.&quot;� She pushed 

another button and put the phone away.

&nbsp;

Kyra pulled a small chair over and sat right in front of

me.� &quot;Well, Allie,&quot; she
said, &quot;you wanted William to

be happy and he's happy.� And
he's going to stay that

way.&quot;� I was weeping over
and around my gag.� I

looked down.� Kara swatted me on
the top of my head

with the whip.� &quot;Look at
me.&quot;� I looked into her eyes. 

They were amused, but cold.

&nbsp;

&quot;Now *you* have a decision to make.� And it will be

the last decision you will ever have to make.&quot;� A cold

chill ran through me.� &quot;You
can go one of two ways. 

I can have you sent to work in a brothel in some third

world country.� You'll probably
end up hooked on

drugs and will definitely find the work taxing.&quot;� She

paused for me to think about that.�
&quot;Or I can have you

trained as a sex slave and placed with a good owner. 

Your training will bind you more thoroughly than

drugs, but you'll have a cleaner, nicer environment,

and the work will be more . . .&quot; she paused to think of

the right word and then said with amusement, &quot;. . .

interesting.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;If you chose the brothel, all you have to do is sit

there.� Sit and wait quietly or
sit and fight.� It won't

make any difference.� But if you
want to become a sex

slave nod your head.� I'll remove
your gag and you

can practice your new career by licking me until I

cum.&quot;� Then she said with
menace in her voice, &quot;But

if you nod your head and then give me any shit at all,

the gag goes back, I'll whip you silly, and the brothel

it will be.� So what would you
like?&quot;

&nbsp;

How did this happen?� What had I
done wrong?� What

was I supposed to do?� The
seconds crawled by.� I

lowered my eyes and nodded once.

&nbsp;

I felt Kyra pat my head.�
&quot;Good girl.&quot;� She
reached

down and removed my gag.� I was
careful to remain

silent.� I heard something snap
and looking up saw her

panties were off.� I could see
her pubic area right in

front of my face as I kneeled before her.� Her hair was

thick and silky and slick with her own juices.� I could

smell her scent.� She rubbed her
clitoris for a few

moments and then carefully spread her pubic hair

away to the sides so that I would have good access.

&nbsp;

I'd never done this before.�
Never.� What choice did

I have?� I carefully leaned
forward and brought my

mouth down to her wet flesh.� My
mind was racing

furiously but going nowhere.� My
tongue was moving

slowly.� I felt Kyra reach down
and give my earlobe a

hard pinch.� &quot;Come on,
Allie, you can do better than

that.&quot;� So I closed my eyes
and tried to do with my

tongue what I usually do to myself with my fingers. 

Kyra sat back and sighed.

&nbsp;

As I got into a rhythm, I could hear water running in

the bathroom.� William was taking
a shower.� Kyra

hadn't lied.� I knew he would be
happy.
