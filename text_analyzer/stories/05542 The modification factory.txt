Notes from the author

&nbsp;

This story
is slow. If you�re looking for some quick sexual descriptions and/or
activities, this is not the story for you.

&nbsp;

If you on
the other hand think that you would enjoy a story about a heroine that falls
down the veritable rabbit hole and becomes trapped in a fetishistic
world of intrigue, plotting, ritualized lesbianism,
institutionalized D/S relationships, the exploration of a artificial culture,
the odd love triangle and with a occasional furry beastman
here and there, then you�ll probably like this story. If you can also accept
that the story is slow and during some parts focuses on nonsexual matters, then
you�re even likely to enjoy it.

&nbsp;

Drop a
quick word if you like it, it really helps my process. Other
than that, peace.

&nbsp;

Oh yeah,
legal stuff.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The last
thing I remember before being abducted was going home from work. I had no
family to go home to, no husband, no boyfriend, no
lover. During the last couple of years, I had been married to my work, and it
had taken a toll on my social life. This fact hit my hard in the head last
month when I turned 40. My biological clock was ticking, I wanted to have kids,
but didn�t have the time for a relationship and wasn�t sure I even had time for
kids.

&nbsp;

Then in the
parking lot under the hospital my life was changed for ever. I don�t remember
much, just a rag over my face and then darkness.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter
1 - Genesis

&nbsp;

Newly awake
I hung suspended in the ceiling, unable to move, unable to speak. I could only
watch the reflection of my own naked body in wall-sized mirror in front of me.
Two robotic hands held my arms. I could feel the pressure against my skin.
Then, to my horror, a dozen other mechanical arms swung down from the ceiling,
all donning scalpels.

&nbsp;

One of them
put the scalpel to my armpit and made an incision along the arm down to the
wrist. I tried to scream, but nothing came out. The others made incisions on my
back, along my legs, along my skull and over my neck. Like razorsharp
lines, they all converged in my back. I could feel the pinpricks of pressure
and coldness from the scalpels, but no pain. I could hear my own heartbeat in
my ears, shouldn�t it beat quicker? I stared wide eyed at what was happening.

&nbsp;

Scalpels
cut circles around the lips, the aureole, the pussy and the anus. Then, a
couple of arms simultaneously put their fingers� in the incisions on my skin. I
didn�t know what they where doing but I could several small long strands snakeing around under my skin. Where they left, the skin
hung loosely from the body. 

&nbsp;

Suddenly
with one big jerk, they pulled all the skin of my body. Panic ensued in my
mind. I saw a skinless woman made out of muscles, bone and tendons in front of
me. Since I was oblivious to the, what in normal circumstances would be a mind
crippling, pain I actually was capable of semi rational thought. �How� how come there�s no blood? I should be
bleeding to death.� I thought. I saw the sack of skin along with my
shoulder long hair lying on the metal floor. A mechanical arm nimbly picked it
up and tossed it into a chute in the wall. 

&nbsp;

The
machines began to remove excess body fat from me by cutting and suction.

&nbsp;

Two arms
picked up and raised my feet. It started slicing tendons and reattaching them,
forcing my feet and toes to point downwards. After securing the bones of my
feet with metallic platings that were screwed to the
bone, the arms relaxed my feet back down.

Shocked, I
was barely awared of what was happening to me, but
the drugs they must have pumped into my system was obviously better than
anything I had ever worked with. My thought process was uninterrupted, except
that I couldn�t move nor feel any pain.

&nbsp;

A machine
made an incision through my abdominal muscle and opened up my bowel. Two arms
held me open and several others darted inside me and started rummaging around.
Stunned, I stared as a bloody organ was quickly tossed out. I looked at it, it
looked like the appendix. �Well, I don�t
actually need that� I thought. Then the machines started pulling out
intestines. �Wait! Wait! I need those!�
I thought, but couldn�t move my mouth. I couldn�t even scream,
my breathing was controlled by a respirator.

&nbsp;

The machine
held my intestines like a ball of string outside my belly. It sorted through it
and hung it up on display on a dozen arms mechanical arms. One of the arms
extended a blade and without further ado cut off more or less all of my
intestines. With a disgusting splashing sound, it hit the now bloodied floor.
After that, I recognized my womb and my ovaries as they got tossed out and hit
the floor.

&nbsp;

A couple of
other organs got thrown together with a handful of different glands. I lost
track of all of it and nearly feinted. But my heart rate and breathing was
regulated. I was forced to stayed awake and watch.

&nbsp;

A large
glass jar filled with a water like substance was
pulled forward along the floor, and in it lay what looked like another set of
intestines and other masses I couldn�t identify. I felt sick to my stomach and
wanted to throw up. A bit ironic, as to the fact that most of my stomach was
gone

&nbsp;

The arms
pulled out my new intestines from the jar and inserted them into me, I could feel the arms prodding around inside me. I also
saw how it readied needle and thread and began to sow inside my body. After it
was satisfied, all arms instantly pulled out of there and closed me up.

&nbsp;

I heard the
buzzing of a mechanical saw and watched as they cut of my lowest rib. With flat
sound, they both fell and clattered on the floor.

&nbsp;

Another set
of arms began to dispose of my old intestines and ribs from the floor. From my
back, my entire waist and abdominal area was covered in a hardened corset made
out of steel and rubber. It hugged around my body and was laced down hard. I
could see my figure in the mirror, my waist was
diminishing by the seconds as the machine pulled the corset tightly around my
muscled frame. It fastened the corset in my back in some manner that I couldn�t
see.

&nbsp;

Two small
incisions were made in my throat and two small mechanical arms entered. I
didn�t know what they were doing, but it only took a few minutes before they
closed me up again. Breathing felt a bit funny, I guess they did something to
my throat.

&nbsp;

Several
arms rose up to inspect my breasts. After short consideration, they implanted a
small implant under the chest muscle to each of my breast.

&nbsp;

I saw how a
needle injected something, I did not know what, into
the fatty tissue of my ass. Another small needle approached my face and
injected my lips with what I could only guess was silicone, or maybe human fat.

&nbsp;

A new
breathing tube was stuck down my nostrils and the one from the mouth was pulled
out. Immediately a green paste was pressed into my to my mouth, Within seconds it solidified. The same was applied my pussy
and my ass. The arms smoothed out this paste to also cover the lips, the vagina
and the sphincter perfectly. Two small globs covered my ears holes.

&nbsp;

The
mechanical arms that held me up began to move rapidly in tracks in the ceiling.
I thought they were going to smash me into the wall, but the wall opened up. I
entered another room, also with a mirrored wall but most notably was the
numerous large tubs in the room filled with different liquids. Two small eye
shields where fastened over my eyes, blinding me.

&nbsp;

I was
immersed into a thick goo and released. I tried to
move, to get out of there but realized that I was still paralyzed. The only
thing between me and death by drowning was a whimsical pair of tubes stuck down
my nose, breathing for me.

&nbsp;

I lay there
in the darkness, paralyzed in the liquid goo waiting for something, anything to
happen. Little did I now that the dermitex
I was floating in was primed to attach itself and parasite on my DNA-structure.
The procedure took about 1 hour, but for me it felt like half a day. Suddenly,
a pair of robotic arms picked my up from the goo.

&nbsp;

I was lifted
up by my feet and dragged away and dropped down into some other liquid. I fell a couple of meters in the air before I made contact
with the surface. I tried to scream again but couldn�t. �This was a lot colder� I thought. After just a few minutes I was
picked up again and the procedure was repeated once again, I was carried away
and dropped in another tub.

&nbsp;

I could
feel a rhythmic humming noise of machinery starting as it coursed through the
tub and my body. It was soothing. I remembered anecdotes how people found dark,
warm, wet places and rhythmic noises calming as it should supposedly remind
them of their time in the womb. I always thought it was nonsense but I could
feel my self doze of.

&nbsp;

I awoke
when someone grabbed my by the heel and lifted my up once again. This time I
stayed up. They did something with my feet, but I couldn�t see or feel what. 

&nbsp;

The arms
detached my eye shields and I could finally see again. But my head was slumped
back and I could only see the ceiling and the swarm of robotic arms up there.
They attached what I only could guess was white plastic eyelids. They rummaged
around at the sides of my eyes for quite a while. I was extremely uncomfortable
having all that sharp metallic objects mere millimetres from my eyes.

&nbsp;

Suddenly,
the machine prodded my eyelid and tested it by gently pushing it downwards and
upwards a couple of times. Satisfied with the result, it withdrew.

&nbsp;

I was
turned around and set down on the floor, the arms still holding me. I could see
my self in the mirror now. What I saw was both deeply disturbing and amazingly
impressive.

&nbsp;

I had skin
again, but it wasn�t my old skin. That was long gone. It wasn�t even like my
old skin. In fact, it wasn�t even remotely like my old skin. It was latex. Or
rubber, or plastic, or whatever you want to call it. White,
shiny, latex all over my body. Except for select areas
that was covered in red latex, namely my nipples, my lips and my vagina.
My anus was also covered red, but I did not know this at the time. All my body
hair was gone, so I was bald.

&nbsp;

My waist
had been reduced several sized, it looked almost cartoony. I had an hourglass
shape that probably no other woman could have without extreme discomfort or
years of lacing, or both. My feet had been placed in en pointe
ballet boots, also in white latex. I couldn�t really see where the boot ended
and my leg started. It seemed to be moulded into the latex from my leg.

&nbsp;

My breasts
had been slightly enlarged. �Maybe C-cups? D-cups?� I thought. They were also lifted, sitting
nicely on my chest. My ass together with my lips had been given a dose of fatty
tissue, enlarged as well. They both had a very sexy pout after the machines was
done with me.

&nbsp;

�I don�t know if I should feel violated or
sexy? I am violated, I am deeply violated. But�� I thought as I stared at
my self. My eyelids was blue, distinctly marked. My
eye lashes where black and very large. They fluttered effeminately as I
blinked. �Hey, I blinked. Does that mean
that I�m regaining�� I thought, but was interrupted by a needle in my arm,
putting me asleep.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Quickening

&nbsp;

Everything
hurt. My stomach hurt horribly, my feet hurt. My eyes hurt, my ass hurt, my
mouth hurt, my pussy hurt, and frankly I hurt all over, because my skin hurt. I
was in a hospital bed, being rolled down a corridor. Finally, it stopped. I
heard the rhythmic soft beating of several EKG machines. It felt like I was
back at work. And I manner of speaking, I was at work,
I just didn�t know it yet.

&nbsp;

�Head
nurse� a stern voice called out. The clicking of high heeled shoes echoed in
the hallway. �Yes most honoured subdirector, how may
I be at service?� He rearranged his suit. �I come bringing news nurse, the factory�s business has been increasing rapidly
lately. The high director has deemed it necessary to extend all departments
with several nurses. The recovery department has received no less than ten
additional nurses, as well as a replacement for nurse Smile Often� he told her.

&nbsp;

�I will
personally see too their swift recovery and integration into the department
most honoured subdirector� she said and curtseyed.
�Very good, now if you�d follow me. I�d like to discuss something in private�
he chuckled. �Off course subdirector, you must give
me the opportunity to thank you personally for these new additions to my staff��, they trailed of.

&nbsp;

I felt,
numb. I opened my eyes, I blinked. I could move again. I started breathing on
my own, and my throat tried to expel the tube that was stuck in it. A nurse
hurried in, she looked just like me, except that she wore a white latex apron
to cover her body. It hugged her waistline, showing of her impossible curves.
She grabbed my head and deftly slid out the tube from my throat. �There, you
can breath again on your own� she said with a smile.
�And let me be the first to welcome you to your new home, to our sisterhood�

&nbsp;

Still foggy
from drugs and just waking up, I couldn�t really process all that she was
saying. �W-what?� was about all I could muster. �You used to be a doctor,
right?� she asked me while checking my vitals. �Yes� I said, astounded and
confused. �How did you know?� She looked at me and smiled. �Because
we all were. You�re a nurse now at the factory� she saw my facial
expression. �Oh don�t be alarmed. We might do nurses work from time to time,
but we have all the benefits from having been a doctor. If you want to
administer a med, just go ahead. That is to say, if you have your superior�s
approval� she giggled and rolled her eyes.

&nbsp;

I looked
even more confused. �Oh don�t you worry, you�ll get the hang of it soon� she
said and patted my thigh. �Hey�� I said sleepily and pointed at my leg. �Yeah,
you probably can�t feel it yet. Don�t worry, your
nerves will reattach itself to the dermitex, that is�
your new skin, during the next day or so. After that, you�ll feel touch again.
By the way, love your eyes� she said. 

&nbsp;

She
clenched her legs together and flashed a flustered smile. �Ooooh...
you new nurses are always so cute. I need to find nurse Pink, if you�ll excuse
me.� She said and walked away. Her apron didn�t cover her back, so you could
see her pouting well formed ass sticking out and underneath her bright red
pussy was partly visible. I watched her leave, still bewildered of where I was
and why. And who were these people? And what did they want with me?

&nbsp;

I looked
around the room, it looked like a hospital. Very clean, coloured in white and
chrome. There was a window looking out over a small field and a forest, a
mountain could be seen in the distance. Three others like me lay in this room,
but one of them wasn�t white like the others. She had a light blue hue.

&nbsp;

Suddenly,
three other white nurses, they also looked like me. Difference in posture and
physique set them aside, but other than that they had the exact same markings.
White latex skin, red latex lips and an apron. They hurried inside with large
smiles on their faces. �Look, look!� one of them said. �Yes, isn�t it
wonderful, maybe we can get out of cock sucking forever?� the other said.
�Forever!� another shouted happily, and they hugged.

&nbsp;

They began
looking and prodding at us. �This one seems a bit shy� they said as the blue
one retracted her leg when one them grabbed it for
inspection. �Help me turn her around, I want to see her ass� she said and her
mates closed up to help her. The blue one screamed in panic, but still had a tube
down her throat, crippling her.

&nbsp;

�Herrrm�� I started, my throat all
sticky and stale from not using it in God knows how long. �Hey, what do you
want with her?� I said, sitting up in my bed. They stopped and turned to me.
�Oh, this one has spirit� I like her already.� One of them said. The three of
them closed up on me, like vultures. �The question, young one, isn�t what we
want with you. The question is, what do you want from
us?� she said with a seductive smile.

&nbsp;

All three
of them stood leaned over me now, looking intently at me and smiling widely.
Their latex faces staring down at me. �This
is some fucked up shit�� I thought and regained my courage. �Look, all I
want to know what�s going on, I�m not even sure I�m awake right now, this feels
more like one of my more surreal dreams.� They started laughing, like a pack of
hyenas.

&nbsp;

�I can
assure you, this is not a dream. It is very real� one of them said and leaned
down over me. �I can prove it� she said and took a needle from her apron and
sunk it an inch into my thigh. �Aow!�
I yelped. They laughed again. �See, not a dream� I looked at them, I failed the
share their amusal of the situation. �Then I want to
know how to get out of here!� I said out loud. �And why would you want to do
that little one? Where would you go? What would you do? Your body has been
transformed.� She said and ripped the sheets from me, showing my latex skin,
deranged feet and laced waist. �You can not function in the outside world, none
of us can� she grinned again, and the others chuckled.

&nbsp;

�This is a
whole new world for you. It must be very confusing. You might get lost, you might step on someone�s toe�s unwittingly. Or you
might fall victim for a stray guardian� She said. Another one of them whispered
to other �I�d love to see that, I think she�d scream her lungs out�. They both
giggled. �Ok� this isn�t funny anymore.
This is beyond fucked up. This is just scary� I thought and pulled the
sheet back over me. �Luckily, I have the solution for your problems� she
started. �You?!� one of the others burst out. �What about us?� she demanded.
�Oh be quiet or I�ll make sure that you spend a week on the woodland pole� she
hissed back at her. The two of them became instantly quiet.

&nbsp;

�You see,
I�m offering you my guardianship, like a mentor. Ah, but where are my manners.
I�m nurse Blackboot�. She said and presented her
hand. Carefully, I shook it. �I guess I don�t have a name yet�, I said. �Oooh� they swooned. �She�s a smart one�. I looked down on
the floor and saw that nurse Blackboots en pointe shoes indeed were black. It was painfully apparent
that she had ulterior motives, but I was terribly scared. �All you have to do
is to accept to be my ward in front of the head nurse and that will be that�
she said. �Ooh, I want her first, can I?� one of the others said. �Don�t be
silly, she�s Blackboots ward. Then I�m having her.� The of them said with a superior snirk.

&nbsp;

I realised
that this was probably a bad idea. �I�m not so sure this is such a good idea�,
I said. �I think I�ll wait and see for myself.� Blackboot
smacked them both on their heads. �Listen now, if you don�t become my ward��
she looked around and bent down to me and whispered menacingly in my ear. �I�ll
have my friend Bloodjaw rip your limbs off and sate
his lusts on your still living torso. Understand?�

&nbsp;

Suddenly, a
deeper voice was heard from the door way. �You know they only want you to be
their bitch, don�t you?� someone said. I could see the anger overcoming Blackboot. She turned around. �Go away nigger, I�m in the
middle of something�. I bent over to see this new nurse. Like the rest of us,
she had a latex skin and was set in ballet boots, but unlike everyone else, she
was a deep black. She was also very tall in her boots, surely a head taller
than Blackboot in front of me. She stood with her
arms crossed under her breasts and looked at her. 

&nbsp;

�You know��
she started with a slight grin �It would truly be horrible if someone had a
stash of wine somewhere here around the hospital. I mean, it is illegal after
all� the black nurse said. �And would be disastrous if that stash was to be found somewhere, say underneath
a loose plate in the second floor washroom.� Blackboot
froze. �And it would an even greater tragedy if someone had dutifully reported
this crime to one of the guardians, and that guardian is searching through
every single washroom in this wing as we speak� wouldn�t it?�

&nbsp;

Blackboot
started sweating. �How can she sweat
through latex?� I looked at it amazed. �Damn you! If this is the way you
want it, then so be it!� Blackboot said and pointed
belligerently at the black nurse. They all hurried out, and I was alone with my
saviour.

&nbsp;

�Thank you�
I think� I said to her. She extended her arm. �I�m nurse Ebony�. I took her
hand. �Do you all have so� eh. Do you all have names that�s
derived from your looks?� She smiled at me. �I guess it�s easier that way. No
one clings to their old name, and everyone gets a nick name. Mine was ebony�

&nbsp;

She rolled
over a stool and sat down next to me. She looked at me intently. �You�re
awfully calm about all of this� she noted. �Most new nurses tend to cry like
babies or just stay catatonic for days. Hell, some of them have do be
terminated due to mental illness� I looked at her and was blunt �I�ve always
been strong on adversity, it makes me try harder� she nodded �I can see that�.
She had a beautiful heartshaped face with pronounced
cheek bones and a slim chin and a nubian
nose. Velvet black eyes gazed softly at me.

&nbsp;

�Could I
have something to drink, my throat�s a bit dry� I said. �Sure�, she got up and
walked over to the sink and filled up a glass. I watched her movements
minutely. Obviously, she wasn�t hindered by her extreme fetish boots. Her ass
also had a slight pout to it, and you could see her flashes of her red pussy in
the deep recesses of her black skin. She returned and gave me the glass. �Now,
drink very carefully. Your stomach has been reduced in size and your intestines
are still in the end of the healing processes.

&nbsp;

I took a
mouth full. It felt a bit weird. �You still don�t have any touch in your mouth,
but you can feel the cold. Just swallow and you�ll be fine� I swallowed. �Why
can�t I feel anything in my mouth?� I asked, confused. �Because you�re like the
rest of us� she said and stuck her tongue out. Her gums, her tongue, going all
the way to the back of her throat her membranes had been replaced with red
latex.

&nbsp;

She pulled
back in. �It will heal in a day or so� I don�t know if it was the sense of
security and trust that she carried with her, if the fact that even my tongue
was covered in latex was the final drop that made the cup spill, but I
instantly felt sad. �What is it?� she asked and laid her hand at my shoulder.
�I� I don�t understand why I�m here� Her smile vanished. �Oh� Can I be blunt?�
I nodded. �You are here because you have been kidnapped and enslaved. No two
ways around it. No one else in here wants to admit to this fact, but it is the
truth. You are here as a non-paid medical worker to make this hospital, or
factory as they like to call it, operational. Lately, we�ve been getting a lot
more clients, so our need for more human resources has expanded�.

&nbsp;

�Oh� What
should I do?� I asked her. �Play along. Otherwise you�ll die. Or worse� I
looked even sadder. She softly grabbed my hand. �Don�t worry. Most of us are
happy here. I promise you, if you�re into medicine, which I�m sure you are,
you�ll find this entire place extremely interesting. Also, don�t take Blackboot�s acting as an example for the rest of us. Sure,
there�s a lot of plotting going around here and if you don�t stay on top of things,
things will stay on top of you. But, all in all� this can be a very satisfying
life, if you let it be� she finished.

&nbsp;

I started
to realize that this place was probably more than I could handle. I was good
with math, I was excellent with biology and I was a downright god with
biochemistry. But social plotting and scheming was never my strong points. �That�s probably why I never got married,
couldn�t grab the right man before someone else did�. I looked at her. �I
think I need a mentor� I said, the reality of the situation now coming down on
me, I started crying. �Ssshh�� she said as she got up
and hugged me.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Later that day�

&nbsp;

Ebony
soothed me as I broke into numerous crying fits over the day, realizing that
all of this was real was a truly soul shattering experience. Weary from the
surgery and from the emotional distress I fell in and out of sleep, I always
woke up with her by my side.

&nbsp;

Later I
tried to get up and walk around against Ebony�s better judgement. Like she
said, I couldn�t keep my balance without holding onto something. I felt even worse, I�ve never felt so worthless in my entire life. No
one seemed to think that my mental state was out of the ordinary, least of all
Ebony. She kept telling me that I was beautiful, and that everything would be
ok.

&nbsp;

She also
wanted us to get joined as ward and custodian as quick as possible but not
before I understood exactly what it meant. �I have to ask you something� she
said. �I was looking out the window. �Go ahead� I said. �It�s kinda personal�� I saw the sun wink behind ruffling leaves.
�I don�t think I�ve never felt so exposed in my entire life. How more personal
can it get?� She licked her lips apprehensively. �Most of the people that get
here have similar sexual orientations. Are you by any chance homo or bisexual�
I turned around and looked at her, like she was ridiculous or mad, or both.
Then I realized �Maybe I am a bit gay? I
was with a couple of girls in college and I�ve been thinking about it on and
off.� I thought.

&nbsp;

�Because
more or less everyone who�s taken here is at least bi,
and frankly, this can be a rough place if you ain�t�
I looked up at her again. �It�s not unthinkable, but it was at least 15 years
since I did it with another woman� I said. I looked at her face. It was truly
incredible how tightly this latex� no dermitex,
fitted the body. It was a bit elastic, just like normal skin and had been
grafted to all the nerves and the muscles on the body, so it covered all types
of facial expressions. Smiling, angry faces, sadness, it could even crease the
brow if it�s wearer wanted to.

&nbsp;

�What are
you looking at� she asked, amused. �Your face, how� how did they do that?� I
said. �Do what?� I looked he in the eye �How did they
graft rubber on top of muscles, tendons and nerve, that�s� I�ve never heard of
anything like it� She smiled her warm smile again �Well, the factory does
possess medical knowledge far beyond what the scientific community knows�

&nbsp;

My skin
started to itch. I scratched my arm. �Here, let me give you something to
alleviate that. Nervous regrowth can be a real prick,
especially when it happens all over your body at the same time� she said and
walked off to get a pill and a cup of water. �Just a mild painkiller� she said
as she handed it to me.

&nbsp;

�Well, as I
was saying. You feel that you might be gay. That�s good, stay with that
feeling, it will help you. Another question. Have you
ever had any fetishist interest, or interest in bdsm
play� I felt like blushing and looked down at my knees. �Yes� I said. �Can we
blush? I feel like I�m blushing. �Well, you can blush but it can�t be seen.
Like normal Africans� I nodded.

&nbsp;

�All right,
I realize there�s no easy way of telling you this so I�ll just say it.� She
started. �You can�t eat normal food anymore, your body
can�t process it. Except for some liquids, there�s
only two known nutrients that your stomach can digest� I picked up my glass of
water and took a sip. �The first one is breast milk and the other is semen� I
spurted water all over the bed. �What?!�

&nbsp;

�That�s the
way it is� she said and nodded. �But, but� why? They
could�ve just made us eat grass or leaves or whatever. Why� why those two?
That�s disgusting!� She laughed a bit. �I�m pretty sure you won�t think that in
a month or two. Anyway, the thing is, all of us nurses produce a milk like
substance that we call nectar, or white nectar, or just the white. But our
production of it only covers the about half the nutritional value you need per
day.�

&nbsp;

My mind
started working, analyzing this pretty easy numerical problem. �Ok� so you
drink your own milk and�� she interrupted me. �We�re allergic to our own milk, we have to feed each other.� I looked at her. �This is getting more insane by the minute�
I thought. �Ok, so we arrange everyone in a circle, where one feeds the other
and the rest of the nutrients come from� ugh, this place is insane. Sperm?!�

&nbsp;

She giggled
at me �That! Would be the mature way to handle it. But
no, you�re still a few guns short of an army sister� she said. �I don�t feel
like guessing, just tell me.� She rolled her stool closer to me. �Ok, this is
how it works. This is where the notion of wards and custodians come into play.
Every nurse has a custodian and every nurse has two wards. They feed from their
wards every day, and in turn, their custodian feeds on them. This creates a
pyramid structure that leads up to the top of the department, and at that top
there is the head nurse. She together with the other four head nurses of the
other department feed the three ladies of the court, who in turn feed the
queen.�

&nbsp;

�Wait a
minute. That means�� I interrupted myself. �We have a queen?� Ebony nodded at
me. �That�s so cool!� I called out. �I�m glad you think so, but�� I interrupted
her again �But wait a minute, if every nurse is fed by two nurses, that can�t
go around forever, it has to bottom out somewhere� She nodded. �Very astute, it
does. Nurses that have no wards for themselves are called many things, most
unpleasant. I like to call them the autarkic� she said. �And that means�?� I
wondered. �It�s latin for
self-supporting�

&nbsp;

�Ok, ok.
But what do they do for food?� I asked. �They go to the guardians for his
semen. They produce pretty impressive amounts, so it will be enough with two
per day if you�re average sized. I wanted three when I was fully autarkic. I
know that nurse Pink has a belly ache after one� I looked at her sceptically.
�So they sustain themselves only on semen?� She nodded. �Yep� I cooked my
eyebrow �That�s not only gross, but also biologically impossible. I say that
you�re trying to fool me�

&nbsp;

She
shrugged and rolled her eyes. Looking out into the corridor, she saw someone.
�Hey, nurse Randy come in here� she called out. �Nurse Randy? That�s pretty demeaning� I
thought. The nurse that woke me up walked in, another petite nurse with bright
pink skin walked behind her, she was a head shorter
than Randy and didn�t even stand six feet in her shoes. �Nurse Pink here is
your only ward, right?� Ebony asked. Randy patted Pink�s head. �That�s true�
She said with a smile, apparently very happy to have her as a ward.

&nbsp;

�So what did
you eat yesterday? I�m trying to teach our new nurse here a thing or two about
life at the factory� Randy looked at me. �Oh, oh yes off course. Well,
yesterday I fed from Pink�s lovely little titties
here� she said and patted Pink�s head again. �And then I managed to grab Redclaw before anyone else did.� Ebony sighed. �Tell our
new nurse here what you did with Redclaw� she walked
up to me. �Well, I kissed him, and fondled him until he couldn�t deny that fact
that he wanted me� she stopped to giggle. �Then he took me, fucked me silly
until he was ready to come, then he pulled out and shot his load in my mouth�
She leaned forward and whispered to me �Redclaw�s the
best, his taste�s of cherry� she winked at me.

&nbsp;

�Thank you
nurse Randy, nurse Pink. You�re excused.� They both curtseyed, something that
looked painfully impossible in ballet boots, and walked out. �Now you could
either chose to believe that this is all some kind of elaborate hoax, or you
could think it is the truth�

&nbsp;

I remained
silent for a long time. �So you want me to be your ward, to feed you from my
breasts once per day?� She looked surprised, �Oh, wait. Well� yes. But! The
ward and custodian relationship is so much more than just food. You will also
become my responsibility, I will be required to look
after you. To teach you and to take care of you when you need it, like family.
Likewise, you�re expected to serve me when I require it�

&nbsp;

�What
exactly does that mean?� I asked. �That I�m your superior. Legally, a custodian
can order her ward around to her heart�s content, only a few acts are noted as
actual crimes. In practice though, mistreating your ward is frowned upon,
unless she has misbehaved�

&nbsp;

She
continued, �Also, the rights of the custodian is
inherited. My custodian, nurse Blacklips, will also
be your superior. Don�t get yourself worked up on
that, only vile nurses like Blackboot and her posse
actually abuses this privilege� I nodded. �So who�s above nurse Blacklips?� I asked. �Nurse Two times� she said.

&nbsp;

Going over
the hierarchy she just described to me I wondered. �Ok, so how many levels are
there? And what level are you at?� I asked. �In the recovery department, where
we work, we�re about 150, so there�s seven full levels and an eighth filling
out as we speak. And given the structure of the system, about half of the
population will always be autarkic. I�m at level five.�

&nbsp;

�What will
happen if I say no?� I asked. �Then you�ll be on your own. I won�t be able to
protect you.� I nodded and looked her in the eye. �Will you be my custodian?�
She smiled warmly at me. She needn�t speak her answer,
we both understood that she wanted it so.

&nbsp;

�May I
suggest a name for you?� she asked. �By all means�.
�Do you know what the did to your eyes?� I reflexively
reached up and touch my face. �What? No� She handed me a mirror. I gingerly
shifted the mirror in front of me and looked at my face. It was a bizarre
experience. At first glance, it looked like someone had strapped a latex fetish
hood on my head, but when you looked closer you saw it clung to the frame of
the face. I creased my brow and it follow, I wrinkled my nose and it followed.
�Amazing work�� I remembered thinking
before I noted my eyes.

&nbsp;

My iris had
always been blue, but the colour looked much brighter now. A
soft light blue colour, very vivid. The skin on my eyelids was coloured
in a light blue eye shade, softly blending into the white of the rest of my
skin. �I thought we could call you Blue eyes� she said to me. Still perplexed
by the sight of myself in the mirror I distantly answered �I think I like it�

The modification factory

&nbsp;

Our heroine
got sedated by a thug paid by an anonymous client to kidnap her, when she woke
up in the operating room she realized that she�d fallen down the rabbit hole.
Her body violently rearranged to that of a white latex doll in front her very
eyes. When she wakes up, she learns that she�s just one of many, and that her
new duties are to work as a nurse and stay alive from the scheming and plotting
of her 150 sisters.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 2 - Learning to walk

&nbsp;

After
resting a day and a night in bed, I woke up from the the bright light of the
morning sun shining in through the window. A tall white nurse was checking up
on us. Other than her apron, she had a white hat of sorts. It was more like a
latex veil fastened in a ribbon at her forehead that swelled down over her
back, it reached her shoulders. It moved and shifted as she walked around and
almost gave the illusion of hair.

&nbsp;

She looked
at me and saw that my eyes were opening. She hurriedly walked up to me. �How do
you feel nurse?� I sat up, still slumberous. �Fine, I think. My skin doesn�t
itch anymore� She hummed and made a note in my chart. �Can you feel this?� she
asked and pinched the skin at my foot. The pain caused me to withdraw quickly.
�Yes� I said. �Good, you�re clear to go. Report to my office in 15 minutes for
registration� she quickly said and left the room. I noted that while her ass
along with her entire backside wasn�t covered by the apron, she had a thong
that covered her pussy and went up between her cheeks.

&nbsp;

I scratched
the sleep out of my eyes as Ebony walked in. �Good morning Blue eyes� she said
with a smile. �Good morning� I said. I sat up in my bed, holding the sheet to
my chest. �We should get you some clothes� she noted. She walked out and
quickly came back with a white latex apron. I noticed now that all of them had
a pretty large red cross on their fronts.

&nbsp;

�You have
to be standing to� I guess you�ve never walked in en pointe boots before, have
you?� I shook my head. �Here I�ll help you� she said and took my hand. I swung
around and sat my feet down on the floor. It felt weird, it felt really weird.
�No way that anyone can walk with their feet like this� I said laughing and
shaking my head. 

�Oh, yes
you can� Ebony said as she grabbed my other hand and swung me up. With a yelp
she got me up to standing. My knees were wobbling and my ankles as well, the
only reason I didn�t fall was because Ebony held my hands.

&nbsp;

The sole of
the boot was on the other hand a lot bigger than I expected. I�ve seen this
kind of boot before on the internet, but it�s sole, that I the area where the
toes touch the ground, usually was pretty small. This on the other hand was
flat and a bit bigger, it made balancing a lot easier.


&nbsp;

I saw now
how tall she must�ve been. I was standing at 5�4�� or so without any shoes.
These things surely added a foot to my length. She was still taller than me. �Shit, that�s one tall lady� I looked up
at her, she looked down on me. �How tall are you in those� she grinned at me. �About seven feet. Intimidated?� I
blushed and turned my eyes away, feeling my nakedness in front of her vividly.
�Here, hold on to this� she said and put my hands on the wall.

&nbsp;

She drew
the apron around me, hooked it over my head and tied it snugly in the small of
my back. She walked around and looked at me, she
straightened out a crease at my thigh. She took my hands again and lifted them
from the wall. �Hey, I�� I began but stopped when my eyes met hers. She was
still smiling softly. �Does she always do
that?� I wondered.

&nbsp;

�Come on
now, walk to me� she said and tugged slightly at my hands. I was expecting
standing to be painful or uncomfortable at best, but I didn�t feel anything.
Tentatively I took a step forward, and sat down my foot with a distinct
clicking sound. I laughed at the ease of it all. I took another step, it was
still wobbly and insecure but I did it! I could actually walk in these shoes. I
took another step, and another and suddenly, my chest
touched Ebony�s. We stood mere inches from each other, she looked down on me, I looked up on her. We still held each other�s hands. I
could feel the warmth of her body on me. I felt myself blush.

&nbsp;

I gently
reached up with my neck towards her, and closed my eyes and parted my lips. She
reached down for me, I could feel her warmth closing in on my lips, I could hear her breath. And then� �Didn�t I tell you to
report to my office nurse?� The nurse with that weird hat again. Ebony still
held my hands but turned to her and curtseyed. I looked at her with
astonishment, curtseying in these boots seemed impossible. I could barely hold
my balance while standing up.

&nbsp;

�We�re
terribly sorry to have kept you waiting head nurse, but Blue eyes here is still
learning to walk� The head nurse harrumphed �Well, bring her in now would you,
I don�t have all day. I�ve got 11 of these acquisition reports to fill out� she
said sternly and walked away. �Come on Blue eyes, the last thing we need right
now is the head nurse�s disapproval� she said and led me out.

&nbsp;

Ebony lead me through the corridors to the head nurse�s office. �I really fell down the rabbit hole this time�
I thought as I looked around. Nurses, like us, was walking around everywhere in
their ballet boots and latex skin. They were chatting, carrying reports,
pulling trolleys, preparing medication. A lot of them had white skin, but the
amount of coloured nurses was pretty large. I saw nurse Pink again, she greeted
me happily. I realised how short she must be now, in her boots she was almost a
full head shorter than me. Ebony seemed like a giant compared to her. �Hell, I feel like a giant compared to her�
I thought.

&nbsp;

I saw two
yellow nurses as well as a menacing looking nurse in a deep blood red skin. �Is
the skin colour in any way related to your normal skin colour?� I asked. �Most
of the times, but it seems that the most honoured directors sometimes let our
colour be dominated by our personality instead of our skin. Pink for example
was white before she came here. We all believe that the directors made her pink
due to her girly demeanour. �I see. Makes sense I guess. The directors� They
run this place, I thought we had a queen?� I said as
she pointed to a large door �It�s in there. The queen answers to the directors.
Subdirector Gerber honoured us with a non announced visit yesterday when he
brought you in. It is the first time this department has seen a director in
five years.�

&nbsp;

I still
clung to her hand and arm like a child, I was to
scared to walk on my own. She led me into the office. She had a large armchair
in front of a huge ornate wooden desk. The room was very neatly kept and she
had bookcases filled with books and the odd diploma. �Sit� she said while
filling out a report. We both sat. �This will authenticate your DNA, set your
thumb in it� she said and pushed forward a machine along the desk. I stuck my
thumb in it and felt a sharp pain as a needle collected a drop of blood from
me.

&nbsp;

�Very good�
she said and rapidly punched a couple of keys on her computer. �Ah yes, recruit
17 from the 245th year, July 26.� She noted �245th year?� I thought. �This is all very simple, you have to
answer two questions, and then you will be given your work schedule. What is
your name?� she asked and looked up at me. �I would like to be called Blue eyes
madame� I said. �Ah yes� she said and started to type in the name in the
records. �If you�re to address me with a title, which you always will, you will
address me as head nurse. Understood?� she said, not looking at me.

&nbsp;

�Yes head
nurse, forgive me, I didn�t know� I said and bowed slightly, not having a
single idea what the proper etiquette was. �No apology necessary, you�re still
new and you don�t have custodian to teach you yet. Which brings us to the
second question, have you chosen a custodian?�

&nbsp;

�Yes head
nurse, after some consideration I would like nurse Ebony to be my custodian� I
said. �I see� she said, �Very well. Nurse Ebony, do you accept nurse Blue eyes
as your ward?� She looked up at the head nurse �Yes I do�,
she made a note at her computer. �Good, you have your ceremony scheduled for
midnight tonight. She said while still typing her report. �Here is your work
schedule nurse Blue eyes, good day.� she said and handed me a paper clipped to
a board with one hand, still typing with the other.

&nbsp;

Ebony got
up and bowed, backed the first three steps before turning around. I tried my
best to follow her lead, but had to support myself on the chair. I tried to
walk backwards, but I lost my balance and had to grab the wall. I turned around
and walked out, leaning on the wall.

&nbsp;

�Scary�� I
said. Ebony looked a preoccupied. �Look, Blue eyes. We have a problem.�� I looked at her. �What?� She looked at the
time. �I�d hoped that the ceremony wouldn�t be so early. My work shift starts
in 10 minutes.� She told me. �Ok� I said, obviously not getting it. �During the
ritual, you have to ceremoniously offer your breasts to me, and I have to drink
from them� I couldn�t decide whether to be disgusted or extremely appealed by
the thought. �ok�� I said tentatively, still not
getting it. �Since you havn�t been fed during the last couple of days, your
breasts havn�t produced anything yet� she said and looked at me. �You�re off
duty for two days now so you can settle in� she grabbed my shoulders and looked
me in the eye. �You need to feed, at least before 10 pm. Do you understand?�

&nbsp;

�You mean,
drink a load of jizz?� I said, my face wrinkled in
disgust. �Yes, otherwise you will embarrass us both tonight� she said, very
seriously. I felt terrible. �I gotta go, I can�t help
you with this one. I�ll be on floor seven if you need me� she said and hurried away.
I felt worse than terrible, I felt horrible.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

A meeting with a guardian

&nbsp;

She left
me, in the middle of corridor. I didn�t know where I was, I didn�t know where I
was supposed to go, I barely knew where I came from. I
took out a direction and started walking, wobblingly, supporting myself on the
walls and other furniture. I stopped and paused to get my bearings. �I don�t even know what a guardian looks
like! I guess they have a penis, or at the very least testicles� Suddenly,
I felt a hand on my ass. �Hello there sweetcheeks, need a custodian?� someone
said. I flinched and turned around. A white nurse, with red eyes stood behind
me. �I� eh� already got one� I said, not used to being fondled by other women
before. �Oh, that�s a shame. She must be a happy woman� she said and leaned
towards me.

&nbsp;

�Actually,
I�m hungry. Would you mind showing me to a guardian?� She bit her lip. �You�ve
never been with a guardian before, have you? You�re the ones who arrived
today?� I nodded at her. �Yes, and yes�. She smiled,
�Well then you�re in luck, I can help you� she said and patted my ass. Feeling
not only the need to save Ebony�s face but also to sate my own growing hunger,
I decided to let her ass patting slip. Normally I�d slap her though,
I�ve done worse to men who tried that.

&nbsp;

She led me
to an elevator and we descended a couple of floors. She led me to what looked
like a cafeteria, a couple of nurses sat there and talked, no one ate anything
though. �Stay here� she told me, and walked away. �Hm, she does not have a thong. I wonder what that means� looked at
the other nurses as they passed by. Lots of them didn�t have any thongs, but a
lot of them did. �Must be a fashion
statement I guess�.

&nbsp;

My friendly
nurse came back. �I�ve spoken to a guardian I know, he says he�ll take care of
you. �Ok, thank you. Where� eh. Where can I find him?�
She pointed to a door. �He�s waiting behind that door� I thanked her and
tottered across the floor there. Another nurse approached me and wondered if I
had a mentor. I respectfully declined them. �What did Ebony say? About half the nurses where
autarkic. I guess everyone would want to get out of that position, when
they see someone new they don�t hesitate to make a move�

&nbsp;

I
approached a large door and knocked at it. No response. I knocked at it again,
still no response. The room had a windowed wall, but the curtains were down. �Am I being set up?� I wondered. I felt
the doorknob, it was open. I took a deep breath and walked in. �Hello, I heard
there was a guardian in here� I turned around to close the door, and when I
turned back my face hit his chest.

&nbsp;

He was
about eight foot tall and four feet over the shoulders. His gigantic muscled
chest was abundant with fur and he smelled like an animal. I looked up and saw
an animalistic head, like a wolf mixed with a goat. I screamed and reached back
for the door, he set his enormous hand on the door, it wouldn�t budge. He
rumbled deep from within his chest and smiled at me, my screaming seemed to
amuse him. His legs had an additional joint, allowing him a large footing and
knee that was bent backwards, a bit like a cat or a dog.

&nbsp;

�P-please��
I tried to plead, but started to cry instead. �He bent down and sniffed my head, I could feel the air rushing around me as he inhaled
sharply. He spoke with a rumbling voice. �You�re the new one?� he asked after
some consideration. �I looked up at him between my hands. I saw a necklace made
out of bones hanging down from his neck, he had a
spear in one hand. �Please, I don�t want anything. Just let me go� I pleaded.
He recoiled slightly. �You�re not hungry?� he said slowly.

&nbsp;

�The lady
said you were hungry� He rumbled again when I didn�t answer. He bent down and
smelled me again. �You smell hungry� he said. I remembered the look on Ebony�s
face when she told me how important it was that I fed before the night.
�Swiftpaw don�t understand. Lady smells hungry, but Lady don�t
act hungry. Denying oneself food, bad sign� he said and shook his head. He
almost looked a bit sad.

&nbsp;

I looked up
at him. �I�m hungry, I must eat� I said to him. �You sure this time?� he asked
rumbling voice. I nodded. �Ok, I will explain� he said slowly. �The women in
the steel castle feed from us, or they die. We, woodsmen, need women to still
our desires, or we go mad� I looked up at him. He had a loincloth made out of
leather that hung between his legs, it was ornated with circular symbols, some
very beautiful. His broad shoulders was furless and tattooed with the same kind
of symbols

&nbsp;

�You
understand?� he asked. I nodded. �Good� he said and swooped
me up with his one hand. I yelped as I was lifted into the air he set me down
on a bed. �You will pleasure my pillar, and I will place my foam in your mouth�
he said and walked up to me, his crotch in the level of my chest. He didn�t
move. �Ok, I guess it�s my turn� I
reached forward and undid his loincloth, and it fell to the floor, revealing a
foot long cock. My eyes struck wide open as I stared upon it. �Oh! My! God! It�s still flaccid�� It
hung flaccid between his legs, already outsizing everything I�ve ever seen or
been with, and they were erect!

&nbsp;

He purred
deeply as he laid his clawed hand on my head, the fingers reaching down to my
shoulders. I reached forward and touched his monstrous cock. His sack hung
beneath him, testicles the size of tennis balls. I could feel his cock twitch
in my hands. �I guess I just give him a
handjob and he shoots straight away� I thought and began rubbing him. His
entire penis, like his skin had a dark shade to it. I kissed his head and
licked it, flashing my eyelids as I looked up at him. He purred even louder,
pressing me towards him. I could feel his cock swelling in my hands. I could
feel myself get wet in my entire crotch area. �I can�t believe I�m actually getting off on this� I thought, not
knowing if I should be disgusted or intrigued.

&nbsp;

I continued
to nibble, kiss and lick his ever expanding manhood as my hands rubbed it up
and down. �I think he�s fully erect now�
I thought as I looked at the gigantic cock I held in my hands. He was surely a
foot and a half long and as thick as grown man�s wrist. Suddenly, he roared
like lion and bared his teeth. I yelped and covered my face with my hands. I�m
not even sure he noticed, he simply grabbed me, turned me around and placed my
chest down on the bed, legs falling down on the side. I couldn�t touch the
ground with my feet. I screamed as I felt his head split my labia open. He
pressed his cock straight into me, and I could feel his fur brushing my ass as
he pushed all the way in, I felt his cock in my inside, filling me up.

&nbsp;

Outside the
window, I saw the nurse that showed me here and one of her friends, peeking in
through the curtains, giggling together. I was still in panic, I was sure that
he was killing me. I screamed and bucked, trying to get away. He rumbled deeply
grabbed my arms with his hands, leaning down on the bed. He leaned and put his
body weight around my arms, the bed squeaked and moaned as both me and it was
rocked back and forth as his monstrous cock was pounding my pussy. �He�s g-going to tea-ear me a-apart � I managed to think.

&nbsp;

Finally, he
pulled out and with a splashing thud, he laid his wet
cock on my back. �You�re cunt is a bit too tight for my taste woman� he said
with a deep voice as I felt his cock slither along my back and slide down
between butt cheeks. I felt his head touching my anus �No pleaseno, donnaaAAH!�
I screamed as he slid his cock all the way into my ass with one swift stroke, I
felt his furry hips touching my ass cheeks. He reached up and set his foot down
on the bed next to, two of his clawed toes resting heavily on my head, pressing
it down on the sheets. He pounded like a mad man, I
thought I was going to die from haemorrhaging and tearing. He went faster and
faster, he started to grunt and snort, I could feel his powerful breath
billowing over my neck and face.

� 

Suddenly he
released me and pulled out, sliding me down to the floor with his one hand. I
fell down to my knees, still shocked, the bed rolled away, squeaking and
shaking after we both left it, leaving me in the middle of an empty floor with
this beastman in front of me, stroking his gargantuan cock in front of my face.
�Drink your fill woman� he grunted and raised my chin with his clawed finger,
stuffing the tip of his head into my red lipped mouth. He exploded and with
violent spasms he filled my mouth with his frothing cum.

&nbsp;

I took
awhile before I realized that I was going to get more than a mouthful, it
spilled over my chin, falling down on my breasts and thighs. I closed my eyes
and swallowed, drank the mouthful. He continued squirting, I felt him jerking
and spraying the back of my mouth. When he had filled half my mouth again, I
swallowed. Two more jerks, filled almost half my mouth again before he stopped.

&nbsp;

Teary eyed,
I swallowed one last time. He chuckled. �You�re very good at this woman, I like
the screaming and the trying to get away, makes a mans
spirit feel good, like after the thrill of the hunt.� He said and pulled back
his loincloth. �I will tell tales of this too my pack mates. May the stars
guide you� he said and opened the door and ducked out, just like that.

&nbsp;

I was left
there sitting on the floor, my tits was bulging out from my apron, my belly was
full, my ass was distended, and my pussy as well, my stomach hurt from eating
to much, for some weird reason my mouth tasted of rice and soysauce, cum still
dripped down my chin to my tits and I was desperately trying to fight the fact
that I was incredibly horny.
