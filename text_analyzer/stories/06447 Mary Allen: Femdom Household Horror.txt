MARY ALLEN: Tonight, The Mary Ellen Show examines the case that has recently shocked America.&nbsp; Parents, tonight's report will have explicit content.&nbsp; It'd be best to remove any children from the room.&nbsp; You may become a little qeasy yourself.

You've seen it in the movies....

(Video clips from movies involving comical dominatrixes and men getting playfulling whipped for laughs)

MARY ALLEN: A kink that most dismiss with laughter.&nbsp; That of leather-clad vixens dominating hapless men.

DR. FORBES: For some reason, our society finds men getting hurt funny.&nbsp; You know, if you had a woman tied down to a bed, it wouldn't be funny.&nbsp; It's almost as if we find women hurting men comical -- or we think it's impossible for it to happen in real life.

MARY ALLEN: But for four teenage boys, there is nothing comical about it.

(Picture of Ben, Ryan, Timothy, and Warren in a courtroom.&nbsp; They're all look athetlic and attractive)

DR. FORBES: There are many people who privately practice this fetish of...domination.&nbsp; What we have in this situation is a husband a wife and their friend extending their private kink into their family life.&nbsp; They took it too far and got to the point where the fantasy and real life were not separate.&nbsp; They effectively brainwashed not just the boys, but the girls as well.

MARY ALLEN:&nbsp; Julia and Richard Douglas along with single-mother Marie Tate exposed their sons and daughters to a private fetish they had practiced since young adults.

DR. FORBES: It seems to have started when Marie Tate's husband died when her children were 3 and 1.&nbsp; Marie, who had been lifelong friends with Julia, moved in next door.&nbsp; They started having sessions with each other in the absence of Marie's husband.&nbsp; As Warren grew up, Marie replaced her husband with her son.&nbsp; The Douglases followed suit.

MARY ALLEN: From interviews and police reports we've learned that from a time when all the kids were very young they started inserting this female domination or femdom as it is called by those who practice it them into their lives.&nbsp; They taught the children that women were superior to men.&nbsp; Investigators uncovered workbooks the moms made up for the boys and girls.&nbsp; The workbooks made them repeat certain phrases like "All boys should serve girls" and "Boys make good pets."&nbsp; The house had pictures all over the place featuring men in subservient positions.&nbsp; It says here, the children watched...porno movies...those featuring submissive men and dominant women...instead of things like Dora the Explorer.&nbsp; -- What a way to grow up.&nbsp; 

DR. FORBES: And parents really do have an influence.&nbsp; Kids usually believe what their parents believe.&nbsp; And these kids sort of had their own twisted religion their parents instilled on them just as other parents would instill Christianity in their own children.

MARY ALLEN:&nbsp; Lead investigator George Banks.&nbsp; What do you have to say about this?

GEORGE BANKS: Well, Dr. Forbes is exactly right.&nbsp; After we uncovered what was going on, it's almost as if the children were hypnotized.&nbsp; You may ask yourself, how did these athletic boys get abused by these dainty girls.&nbsp; Well, from the moment they were born, they were told that's how the world was and how God wanted it.&nbsp; When we interviewed them, the boys would say things like "Well God gave us muscles and he gave girls brains", "Boys should be seen and not heard" or "We have to serve girls, or we won't go to heaven."&nbsp; The girls said, "God put men on earth to serve us." or "We do all the thinking, they do all the labor.&nbsp; That's the way it's supposed to be."&nbsp; So, they very much believed that their situation was what life was like.

MARY ALLEN: What is most disturbing is the parents hid it fairly well.&nbsp; Family, friends, and teachers had no idea what was going on.&nbsp; The boys good looks made them popular at school.&nbsp; They seemed perfectly normal, but no one knew what was going on.&nbsp; However, one friend, eventually discovered the truth.&nbsp; Introducing, Bobby Green.

(Bobby walks out and shakes hands with the other guests and Mary Allen.)

MARY ALLEN: Welcome to the show.

BOBBY: Glad to be here.

MARY ALLEN: So, you had no idea how these people lived their lives.

BOBBY: Well, I always knew they were a bit different.&nbsp; I was..am real close friends with the twins, Ben and Ryan Douglas.&nbsp; But, outside of school, they were never allowed to do too much.&nbsp; I got to come over sometimes.&nbsp; They came to my house a few times.&nbsp; But, they weren't allowed to ever go out or play sports with me, even though they had to work out in their basement everyday.&nbsp; I just thought their dad was strict with the boys and that's why the girls got to do whatever they wanted.&nbsp; They lettered in almost every sport.&nbsp; So you know, I knew they were weird, but I didn't suspect anything like this.

MARY ALLEN: So when did you start to notice something was off.

BOBBY: Well, when I was a junior.&nbsp; I started dating Shawna.&nbsp; It started off normal.&nbsp; I thought she was just being cutesy, you know, when she'd ask me to open doors for her, or to paint her toenails.&nbsp; Then, things started getting a bit more weird.&nbsp; Like, one time, she asked me to wear her panties to school.&nbsp; I thought it was a little weird, but...

(The audience laughs as Bobby smiles)

BOBBY: She started handcuffing me to the bed when we'd..you know.&nbsp; Not exactly my cup of tea, but still kind of hot.&nbsp; But I noticed she was really aggressive. She didn't want to really talk to me or respet me.&nbsp; It was purely physical.&nbsp; So, I think I started giving her signals that I was about to break up with her.&nbsp; So, one time, when I was handcuffed to the bed, she placed this thing on...my penis.&nbsp; It was a chastity belt.&nbsp; She said, if I ever wanted to have sex again, I'd have to stay with her because she had the key.

MARY ALLEN:&nbsp; For anyone who doesn't know, a chasity belt is a locked device placed around the penis that prevents a man from achieving an erection. So what did you do next.

BOBBY:&nbsp; Heh.&nbsp; I was too embarassed to tell anyone or get help.&nbsp; I tried to take it off myself.&nbsp; It didn't work.&nbsp; So, I just stuck around.&nbsp; She'd keep it on my for a few weeks.&nbsp; I'd do whatever she said so she'd take it off.&nbsp; She'd make me kiss her feet, give her a back rub, or something.&nbsp; But then, she'd only take it off once I was cuffed to the bed.&nbsp; She'd basically...rape me...and then put it back on.&nbsp; I got really depressed.&nbsp; I lost interest in things.&nbsp; I couldn't sleep.&nbsp; I couldn't concentrate at school at all.&nbsp; I don't know how the other boys did.

(Bobby starts to get teary-eyed.)

DR. FORBES:&nbsp; And most teenage males ejactulate two or more times per day...let alone once per a couple weeks.&nbsp; So, it really was torture.

MARY ALLEN: Well if you don't mind us showing it Bobby, here is a picture that Shawna took herself that displays just how depressed Bobby was.

(There's a picture of Bobby in his boxer shorts handcuffed to the bed.&nbsp; He's crying, has deep sags under his eyes, and bruises in many places.

MARY ALLEN:&nbsp; But you eventually told someone.

BOBBY: Yep.&nbsp; I told my best friends at school -- Ben and Ryan -- what their sister was doing.&nbsp; I thought maybe they could get their parents to do something about it or something.&nbsp; I think they saw it as an opportunity to sort of invite me into their world...because they were so lonely.&nbsp; So they told me their parents had them in chastity belts for years.&nbsp; They tried to justify it.&nbsp; At one point they said they thought all boys should have to wear one.&nbsp; That's when I knew.&nbsp; And that's when I finally went to the police.

(Mary Allen tries to pretend as if she is very upset, but she is actually aroused.)

MARY ALLEN:&nbsp; You are truly a hero.

BOBBY: Thank you.

MARY ALLEN: But Bobby wasn't the only one who thought something was off.&nbsp; Introducing, Judith Wilkes, an English teacher at the high school that the Douglas and Tate families attended. 

(Judith Wilkes enters the stage and takes a seat.)

MARY ALLEN: Welcome.&nbsp; Thanks for being here.

JUDITH WILKES: Thanks for having me. 

MARY ALLEN: So, you never suspected much either.

JUDITH WILKES: Like Bobby said, I knew the family was odd, but never thought any parents could do this.

MARY ALLEN: So you've taught all the boys at one point in time.&nbsp; Did they ever give you any trouble?

JUDITH WILKES: No, they were always extremely polite and nice.&nbsp; Much more respectful than average students, especially boys.&nbsp; The only problem was that they always violated dress code.&nbsp; They'd come in wearing very tight-fitting clothes.&nbsp; Blue jeans and a wife beater.&nbsp; They're good looking boys, you know, and I thought they were just showing off to the girls.&nbsp; They'd say they had nothing else to wear.&nbsp; I just kind of overlooked it.&nbsp; Boys will be boys you know.&nbsp; Plus, it's not like they were bad to look at either.

(Polite laughter.&nbsp; One audience member smiles and nods her head)

JUDTIH WILKES:&nbsp; But now I know their mom told them what to wear everyday.

DR. FORBES: Right.&nbsp; The parents seemed to know that if putting them on display would make them feel inferior.&nbsp; At home, they would wear next to nothing.&nbsp; Their underwear, speedos... Sometimes they'd be made to go completely naked.&nbsp; The workbooks they were made to do as children echoed this.&nbsp; One page says "Men must properly display themselves out of respect for women."&nbsp; This explains their dress.&nbsp; The boys actually thought it'd be a sin to cover up.&nbsp; 

MARY ALLEN:&nbsp; They also had costumes.&nbsp; At Shawna's birthday party, the boys are all dressed as near-naked butlers.&nbsp; Of course, everyone thought it was just a cute thing the boys decided to do for the party.

(A picture of the boys wearing butler costumes and carrying trays at a party.)

MARY ALLEN:&nbsp; Samantha Bridges got wrapped up in the whole thing and regrets it.&nbsp; Join us, Samantha.

(Samantha Bridges walks in.)

MARY ALLEN: Hello Samatha.

SAMANTHA: Hi...

MARY ALLEN: So, you are Timothy's girlfriend.&nbsp; How did you get wrapped up in that.

SAMANTHA:&nbsp; Well Timothy was forbidden to date anyone.&nbsp; But he was interested in me.&nbsp; His mom knew too.&nbsp; She'd take him to the restauraunt where I work and embarass him by ordering for him and having me come over to the table.&nbsp; It just made me think he was cuter.&nbsp; So eventually we started dating.&nbsp; We did it kind of secretly.&nbsp; But things started getting weird when I wanted to..do stuff.&nbsp; I'd ask if he'd like me to pleasure him...orally.&nbsp; He'd always refuse and pleasure me instead.&nbsp; At first I thought, "Wow I have the best boyfriend ever."

(The audience laughs.)

SAMANTHA: But i started to get scared because he never, ever let me touch him.&nbsp; Then, one day, I found the chastity belt.&nbsp; And he came clean and told me basically everything.&nbsp; 

MARY ALLEN: And you didn't go the police.&nbsp; Why?

SAMANTHA: He told me not to.&nbsp; Plus, he said that his mom would only allow him to have a girlfriend who believed women are superior to men.&nbsp; So, he basically talked me into acting like someone I wasn't so we could be together.&nbsp; And I really like him.&nbsp; I love him really.&nbsp; If I wanted to be with him, I'd have to join his way of life.

MARY ALLEN: Is that how you see it?&nbsp; A way of life -- or abuse?

SAMANTHA:&nbsp; Well that's for the court to decide.&nbsp; But to them...it was a way of life.&nbsp; Just as some celebrate Passover, they celebrate female superiority. 

MARY ALLEN:&nbsp; Samantha actually managed to video tape some of what this way of life was.&nbsp; What did it usually entail?

SAMANTHA:&nbsp; Well unlike most adults who practice this sort of thing, the family was like this 24/7.&nbsp; There was never a moment where the boys weren't doing work around the house for the girls.&nbsp; I'll admit it.&nbsp; It was very nice.&nbsp; I was young and stupid and actually kind of got off on it.&nbsp; They seemed to think they were doing the right thing, always.&nbsp; They never asked us to stop or complain of abuse.&nbsp; Sometimes they'd say, "I wish I was girl" and we'd all laugh together.&nbsp; They really believed they just got the wrong end of the stick, and were born a member of the inferior sex that does all the hard labor.&nbsp; They wanted to be the best male they could.

JUDITH WILKES: I agree.&nbsp; In school, they'd be very frustrated with math or reading work and were only happy if they were in shop class or something.&nbsp; They were also some of the only boys to take Home Economics.

MARY ALLEN:&nbsp; So we'll show you some clips now that Samantha took with her cell phone.&nbsp; Now what's happening in this first clip.

(The clip shows up on a screen.)

SAMANTHA: This is the first day I came home after school with the Douglases.&nbsp; I didn't know about the Tates until they walked right in the house with us.&nbsp; The girls came inside and immediately started working on homework or watching TV.&nbsp; But the boys had to stop at the door and strip.&nbsp; You can see the girls making them put their hands on their head and sort of parade around.&nbsp; You can sort of see the chastity belts where they blurred it out.&nbsp; Then, the twins go off to workout while Timothy and Walter start to prepare dinner, clean, and do laundry.&nbsp; After an hour, they switch places.&nbsp; That's Michelle and Rachel hitting Timothy and Warren with rulers as they try to cook dinner with nothing but their aprons on.

MARY ALLEN: Wow.&nbsp; So, what did yo think about this.

SAMANTHA: Well, I feel so guilty about it now.&nbsp; But at the time I thought, "This is great."&nbsp; It sort of seemed like a big joke or something or like we were doing for fun.&nbsp; I didn't fully comprehend that this is how they led their lives.

MARY ALLEN: Okay, roll the next clip.&nbsp; This one is right after you have finished eating dinner.

(The clip shows up on a screen.)

SAMANTHA: Well, all women have finished eating.&nbsp; We are seated at the table.&nbsp; There is a rule in the house that the boys can't sit on any furniture.&nbsp; The boys eat whatever we don't.&nbsp; We just put everything into a big bowl on the floor.&nbsp; The boys get on their hands and knees and crowd around the bowl for dinner.&nbsp; They're not allowed to use their hands.&nbsp; You can see they're getting a bit competitive because there's not that much food there.

MARY ALLEN:&nbsp; My gosh.&nbsp; They are treated like dogs.

SAMANTHA: Actually, their dog Spike gets a bit of hamburger every night and is also allowed to sit on the couch.&nbsp; So, they were treated worse.

(Mary Allen tries not to crack a smile.)

MARY ALLEN: Okay, so this next clip is after dinner.

(The clip shows up on a screen.)

SAMANTHA: Right, all the women are sitting in the living room with some wine.&nbsp; The boys have to put on a bit of a show for us.&nbsp; They draw sticks.&nbsp; Timothy was the lucky one.&nbsp; He got out of his chastity belt and is...pounding...a blowup doll.&nbsp; The twins are made to make out with each other.&nbsp; They had to French kiss.

MARY ALLEN:&nbsp; What is that contraption Warren is sitting on?

SAMANTHA: Oh, he's being milked.

MARY ALLEN: Milked?

SAMANTHA:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; The moms were worried that if the boys never ejaculated they could develop prostate cancer.&nbsp; So, they have the boys sit on this device that massages the prostate.&nbsp; There are electrodes on his penis and his hands are chained to the side.&nbsp; This way, they ejaculate, but it's slightly painful and not pleasurable.&nbsp; After he ejaculates, I believe they make him drink the collection.

MARY ALLEN: Sickening.&nbsp; Where is the father during all this?

SAMANTHA: Richard works 12 hour days.&nbsp; All his money goes right into Julia's control.&nbsp; But when he is home, he is made to participate in activities. 

MARY ALLEN:&nbsp; It should be noted that it is still a fetish for him.&nbsp; He is getting off on this.

SAMANTHA: Right.

MARY ALLEN: Do you think the boys are?

SAMANTHA: No.&nbsp; I think they just believe they're doing what God wants them.&nbsp; They don't enjoy it.&nbsp; But that's life.

MARY ALLEN: Okay, so one last clip.&nbsp; The boys are being "tucked in."

SAMANTHA: Yeah.&nbsp; This is the boys room...it's the smallest bedroom in the house.&nbsp; Julia and Marie are covering them up with that sheet. 

MARY ALLEN: There is only that one tiny bed for all four of them.

SAMANTHA: Yes.

MARY ALLEN: Okay.&nbsp; Thanks Samantha, Judith, Bobby, and Dr. Forbes.&nbsp; Next up -- we're going to talk to the family members themselves.&nbsp; The boys will tell us how they feel.&nbsp; Plus, Julia, Marie, and Richard's lawyer will discuss the upcoming case and the legality of their actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
