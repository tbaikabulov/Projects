 Red Silk Scarves
He knew exactly where to start. A gently placed kiss on the flesh underneath her navel and right before her jeans started. He could feel the gentle vibrations coming from the vibrator in her in her pussy. Set on a frequency strong enough to get her close but low enough never to bring her there. He loved her like this. In a deep state of need where there was no escape. Where everything throbbed and pulsed with pure unfiltered desire. Her soft moans and crooning pulsed out a beat above his head as his tongue and mouth slowly and sensuously began moving up her body. While his hand drifted down to catch a piece of string lying in between her legs. 

He had come back to the dorm late. He had his final midterm in the morning and was getting some late night studying in before hand. It was cold outside. Just before Christmas vacation. She had promise to stay up and wait for him. 

�If I&#8217;m asleep when your get home you can do what ever you want to me.� She had said with a smile along with the fervent belief that she could stay awake.

He knew she would be asleep when he got there. One it was late really late, but not to late to do something. Two she had had her final midterm today. She had been studying for weeks and stress plus the extra exhaustion she wouldn&#8217;t be able to make it till he got home. He had known this when he agreed to the deal, but didn&#8217;t say anything. He would have two and a half weeks straight of doing anything he wanted to her and figured he might as well get and early start. The thought of what he had planned brought a stirring in his loins he felt the bulge in pants grow.

He began to think of what he was going to do tonight when he remembered that they had to spend three days at her parents&#8217; house for Christmas. He stood outside their dorm door. He could think of some way to do things to her at her parents&#8217; house. In fact the thought of doing what they did under her father&#8217;s roof turned him on even more. He pulled his attention back to the door. Quiet just as he thought. He smiled to himself and opened the door. He made sure to stay quiet wanting her to be asleep until he had everything he needed ready.

He crept towards the bedroom to make sure. She was.&nbsp; Like sleeping beauty she lay there splayed out on the bed. Her hair fanned out naturally behind her head as her naked chest gently moved up and down. Slipping in the bathroom he grabbed his bag of toys, which he had hidden earlier, and slipped off his shoes before heading into the room. He slipped in just as quietly and the floor didn&#8217;t creak do to the carpet. Moving a chair next to the bed, he sat down and smiled down at her. Gently removing a strand of hair from her face he shook his head once again and began. Carefully he picked up her hands tying her wrist with a red silk scarf and did the same to the other tying them together above her head and to the head board with another scarf.
He waited to see if she would wake. She had begun to move a little but soon returned to the deep sleep she had begun in. He moved onto her legs which were slightly easier as they were already separated. With the same type of scarves he tied each leg to the legs of the bed, leaving her spread eagle. He sat down in the chair it would take her some time to settle down again. Her feet were one of the most sensitive part of her body. Most people who knew her would have said he was lucky to have even gotten one foot tied. He would just say he was that good. He put out the diffuser sticks (wooden sticks that soak up oil and release the scent of the oil) using lavender to help her get back to sleep. 
While he waited he thought about the day he had met her. She had been sitting in a tree. Not under it as most college students tend to do. She had been reading a book on the karma sutra. Of course he hadn&#8217;t known that until he&#8217;d sat under the tree not noticing she was up it. As he was finishing a final edit on a paper a few leaves fell down on to his lap. He had brushed them off blaming it on the wind and continued typing. Shortly after another batch of leaves fell and kept falling. �HEY!� He looked lucked up and saw her face looking down at him while the sun twinkled behind the golden leaves of fall. Of course the conversation had begun with why are you up in a tree. He soon joined her in said tree and the conversation went on from there. The most vivid thing he remembered was when he asked her what she was reading. She blushed and tried to hide it. He grabbed her wrist and smiled, his naturally dominant nature coming out. He said let me see. Her blush ran deeper as she released the book into his hands. He remembered thinking, as he looked up at her face, that she was becoming part of the tree as the shade of the leaves matched the shade of her face. 
They had been together ever since. She became putty in his hands as their relationship grew. She was quickly submitting to his will. Two years latter here he sat on a chair beside the bed in the dorm room that they shared. He gazed over at her waiting a few minutes and before continuing. He deftly tied a thin string around her highly aroused clit. She didn&#8217;t move, releasing his pent up breath he pulled his hands away and grabbed the final scarf. The final thing to wake her, he picked up a decent size vibrator her sex was already wet and open he gently and slowly slid it in. When it was in all the way she was already waking up but not quite there yet. He checked to make sure everything was in place. He picked up the final scarf and draped it across his neck. Then grabbed the string and placed his finger on the on switch to the vibrator. Counting to three in his head tugged up on the sting and flipped the switch on. Her eyes flashed open. She moaned out and took stock of her situation. 
�Hey sleepy head you fell asleep.�
�Mark. What, no I couldn&#8217;t have.� 
She turned her head to look up at the clock and sighed dropping her head back. �So you&#8217;re taking me up on our deal.� He smiled up at her and said �Yes.� He changed his voice so that she new he was serious and who was in charge. �Now be a good girl and let me gag you.� He held up the scarf. She closed her eyes and then opened them lifting up her head. �Now I trust that you won&#8217;t get to loud. I don&#8217;t want to have to put a real gag on.� She nodded as the gag was finally in place �Good. Now lets get started.�
He knew exactly where to start. A gently placed kiss on the flesh underneath her navel and right before her jeans started. He could feel the gentle vibrations coming from the vibrator in her in her pussy. Set on a frequency strong enough to get her close but low enough never to bring her there. He loved her like this. In a deep state of need where there was no escape. Where everything throbbed and pulsed with pure unfiltered desire. Her soft moans and crooning pulsed out a beat above his head as his tongue and mouth slowly and sensuously began moving up her body. While his hand drifted down to catch a piece of string lying in between her legs. 
He continued his way up her stomach to the valley in between her breast. He began to nibble at her neck. Kissing and biting. Sending electric waves through her body each time and she began to tremble and shake. She would have been begging had it not been for the red silk scarf tied about her mouth. He continued up tasting her sweet sweat as he did. She had thrown her head back in frustration. He continued to tease. Soft caresses here. Occasionally he tugged at the string, her body arching up sharply. He always made sure to space it out correctly so as to never send her over the edge into oblivion. Her moaning went up an octave. He tried to hold back a smile. Knowing that sometimes she just didn&#8217;t notice, which made it even harder on her. 
Dropping the string he squeezed her clit hard and glared up at her. She had thrown her head back, trying hard to feel the touch of his hand again. She closed her eyes and went quiet, so that only her silent panting could be heard through out the room.&nbsp; He softened his gaze and removed his hand from her pussy and crawled up nibbling on every part of her body. Finally reaching her ear sucking, biting, blowing on it, he undid the gag. 
�Who&#8217;s my whore?�
�I am.�
�Who&#8217;s my slut?� his hand reaching down to pull sharply on the string. 
�I am.�
�Who am I?� another tug and a nip at her ear. 
�The master of my heart, body and spirit, you are the controller of every feeling I have. You are the master of my life.� 
He released the tension on the string out of surprise, but soon regained composure. A throaty growl came from his throat. He began to nibble again thinking hard. He counted down from twenty his finger viciously rubbing away at her clit. When he reached zero he placed his other hand over her mouth and nose. Her body went tense and she through her head back hard, his hand still covering her mouth. He continued to rub her clit knowing the lack of air only made it more exciting. She fainted and he removed his hand smiling down at this beautiful woman sweaty and breathing hard.
Gently waving smelling salts under her nose he revived her. Her eyes flashed open. His fingers still rubbing her clit, she smiled over at him. �Rachel, what you said early. Was new, interesting, and serious, we need to talk about it? Nod if you agree.� She nodded slightly confused, but slowly coming to the realization of what she had said really meant. �It sounded like a proclamation. Were you giving yourself to me?� She thought again and then nodded yes. He aimless began tugging at the string still tied to her clit thinking inwardly. He had always hoped and expected this; he just hadn&#8217;t expected it so soon. He loved every part of her. 
He let go of the string and pulled it off. Causing a sharp intake of air and her body to jump on the bed he undid the gag and slid his cock into her mouth. He could tell she was thinking, but it was difficult with the constant vibrations emanating from the vibrator still firmly lodged in her pussy. Soon he couldn&#8217;t think any longer with his cock in her mouth and began to fuck her face in earnest, dumping loads of cum down her throat. As she swallowed he gently slid the silk from off her ankles and her wrist. He soon slid up and sat by her, pulling her up into a sitting position. 
�Rachel if you&#8217;re sure about this I want you to go in the other room and write up a Submission Agreement. Tell me five things you want from this relationship. If you can&#8217;t think of five that&#8217;s okay, but you cannot have more than five. Then print off two copies and we will both sign them out in the tree where we first met. Don&#8217;t take the vibrator out that should speed up your work. You should be highly aroused when you&#8217;re done not only from the vibrator, but from your words as well. I&#8217;m going to take a nap, wake me up when you&#8217;re done.� With her eyes twinkling with lust she smiled up at him and he smiled back. She got up lightly, he spanked her butt gently, and she traipsed off to the living room. 
�Oh and Rachel,� she turned back to look at him, �no orgasms.� He closed his eyes but not before he saw her eyes get wide and her lips turn pouty.&nbsp;
