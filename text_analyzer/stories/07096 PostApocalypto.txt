Postapocalypto

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale rode his Yamaha quad as fast as he could navigate it, looking through the green glow of his night-vision goggles to see his way along the path.&nbsp; He had reached some odd terrain; not many trees, but a lot of small ditches that would easily bend a wheel or worse, an axle, if he pushed it too fast.&nbsp; He had to be careful, but he also had a long way to go with only a few more hours of darkness to conceal him.&nbsp; It was a cloudy cold evening and the moonlight was blocked by thick clouds.&nbsp; All better for him.&nbsp; He had a delivery to make and he needed all the darkness he could get.&nbsp; He would have preferred a nice loud thunderstorm to muffle the sounds of his machine, but it didn&#8217;t look like rain this evening.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _______________________________________________________

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hell had never reigned from the sky as doomsayers anticipated.&nbsp; When the nations decided to try to eliminate one another, the method of doing so rode the winds and waters.&nbsp; Many different biological variations were utilized that decimated huge populations on all continents.&nbsp; One variation, however, was particularly selective in its purpose, only affecting males.&nbsp; While the general population decreased by over 70% as a result of hostilities between the superpowers, the world&#8217;s male population saw a 90% reduction as a result of this particular strain&#8217;s highly contagious nature.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sixteen years after the great conflict, the strain had become a disease carried by all humans, but still was only harmful to men.&nbsp; Almost every male eventually caught the disease, but only one in ten survived it.&nbsp; About one third of those were forever incapacitated, spending the remainder of their lives in vegetative states as a result of incredibly high fevers. Those that survived developed an immunity to the disease and were not affected further, but remained carriers of the virus.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale, busy navigating the terrain, did not notice another figure standing in the open hatch of an armored personnel carrier, but the figure noticed him.&nbsp; She eyed him first through her heat-sensitive scope, the heat of his Yamaha&#8217;s engine giving him away, despite his attempts to cloak it with a heat-resistant coating.&nbsp; In the daylight, this may have worked, as the heat signature was not unlike that of a boulder warmed in the sunlight (albeit a moving one), but in the cool evening, and in the wide-open as they were, his yellow-orange signature stood out in stark contrast to his surroundings.&nbsp; Switching to her night vision scope, she could see greater detail.&nbsp; And she could see the difficulty he was having with the mini-trenches that had been dug row after row to slow runners like him down.&nbsp; She calmly pushed the button on her radio headset to transmit, and informed the other two units in her platoon that a rider was approaching their position.

__________________________________________________________________________
 



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The world had carried on after the end of the conflict, albeit at a greatly reduced rate of population growth.&nbsp; Treaties were signed and the entire surviving world seemed to realize what it had done to itself.&nbsp; With so many men dead, women assumed positions of power and influence.&nbsp; A few wealthy and powerful men remained, but virtually all the world&#8217;s leaders were now female.&nbsp; At first, laws were passed in most major countries to allow the few remaining men to take multiple wives.&nbsp; These male-centered laws were put into place as a method of population replenishment.&nbsp; As time went by, however, the sense of power rapidly shifted toward the female sex, and keeping men at the center of leadership in the family became as outmoded as keeping them in political power.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As wealth and power was redistributed, men were generally reduced to status symbols for the elite female population.&nbsp; At first, many wealthy women did what they could to lure men into relationships, but soon found that men were too apt to stray as a result of having so many women constantly throwing themselves at them.&nbsp; For a time, it became nearly impossible for any woman to keep a man unless he truly wanted to be with her, because he could choose from so many others.&nbsp;&nbsp; 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale and his Yamaha came to the end of the large open area he had traveled for the past 2 miles, and was staring up a large hill, largely covered in trees.&nbsp; He would have to ride directly up the hill, navigating the woods along the way.&nbsp; He knew that the other side of the hill marked the halfway point of his journey, according to his map.&nbsp; Although he had been running for years, he had never made the trip to the colony north of his before, so he was nervous as he eyed the wood line before him.&nbsp; With a sigh, he eased out on the clutch and replaced it with a measure of petrol, beginning his ascent of the hill.&nbsp; 



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the utter decimation of the male population, having a man of one&#8217;s own was an almost unattainable dream for most women.&nbsp; Still, many women agreed to share, and many men who had been previously attached chose to stay with the women they loved.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As with any high-value commodity, at some point a black market emerged.&nbsp;&nbsp; While the governments of the world condemned the practice officially, many of the most influential women in the world were the very ones involved in this new clandestine institution, which was nothing more than a very organized slave trade.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of the world&#8217;s men had seen the slave trade emerging as fellow men began to turn up missing without explanation.&nbsp; These males banded together and along with their wives and families moved to unpopulated areas- areas not uncommon after the thinning of the world population only a decade before.&nbsp; They formed colonies within their respective countries.&nbsp; Many of these colonies were formed in towns abandoned during the conflict, where housing and other structures and utility systems already existed.&nbsp; Soon after moving to these colonies, the men elected their own leaders.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two armored personnel carriers took up positions behind trees at the base of the large hill Dale was ascending on his quad.&nbsp; They had been radioed by the third APV a general course heading and were able to gather from that the approximate area Dale would arrive at when he got to the hill.&nbsp; Seeing him approach for over a mile now, they had been given plenty of time to prepare for his arrival.&nbsp; The APVs were over 100 meters apart, but the two squads of female mercenaries had eyed Dales position and the eight women carefully moved in as he got closer and his general course narrowed.&nbsp; The third APV, the one that had first spotted Dale, followed a half-kilometer behind him with another squad of 4 women inside.&nbsp; It would block any attempt he made to retreat.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Dale got closer to the hiding squads lying in wait, tire spikes were laid out, and lines between the trees were quickly strung up in the general area where Dale was expected to be heading, in case the other methods of removing him from his machine failed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Up the hill Dale rode, starting to actually feel safer now that he was not out in the open.&nbsp; His predators kept still, lying in wait for him as he drew nearer to them.&nbsp; 100 meters, 80 meters�..


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The governments of the world&#8217;s leading countries, now almost exclusively led by women, dealt quite gingerly at first with the idea of having independent colonies governed by males popping up within their own borders, a move that amounted to seceding from their respective unions.&nbsp; No direct military action was taken, but within a short time all official lines of communication between the colonies were blocked in a purported effort to keep the colonies from allying with one another and possibly mounting any type of military threat.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only was communication blocked, but travel between colonies was eventually blocked as well.&nbsp; This effectively rendered each colony an island to itself.&nbsp; So while the militaries of the world&#8217;s governments took no direct action, they did mount armed patrols that enforced the no-communication zones, keeping cell towers or hard lines from being installed.&nbsp; All satellite and radio signals were scrambled, even HAM radio signals.&nbsp; Furthermore, any person caught in the non-com zones between colonies was arrested on sight.&nbsp; If that person was male, he was sometimes not heard from for weeks or months and in some cases, never.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually, government patrols were reduced in number in favor of privately-funded paramilitary companies which formed their own patrols and worked off government contracts to supplement the needs of the military.&nbsp; These companies were comprised mainly of squads of female ex-government soldiers roaming the cities and countryside in APVs, looking for men to arrest for supposed violations of the non-communications act.&nbsp; These private firms were far less regulated than their government counterparts, and as such it created an environment ripe for unofficial activity.&nbsp; When the privately-funded patrols began, virtually all detainees caught in the non-com zones never returned to the colonies.&nbsp; Even female detainees were arrested and held indefinitely, discouraging the use of women as message carriers.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The private companies that assumed the governments&#8217; patrol duties were basically run by the slave traders, a fact not particularly unknown to the governments which looked the other way.&nbsp; After all, every male citizen that could be repatriated was considered a production unit, one that produced taxpaying citizens.&nbsp; The governments of the world were not about to question the legality of any woman who became impregnated, with a don&#8217;t ask, don&#8217;t tell policy regarding the entire process.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually, as a result of the relentless mercenary patrols, all communication between the colonies had to be relegated to &#8216;runners&#8217; that rode high-powered all-terrain vehicles.&nbsp; The runners typically rode at night and would average 10-20 kilometers per hour across varied terrain.&nbsp; It was a risky job, and many runners never made it to their destinations.&nbsp; But communication was deemed necessary to the survival of the colonies by their leaders who felt it was only a matter of time before sanctioned kidnapping raids would be levied upon them by the governments of the world in an attempt to save their dwindling populations.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale saw something out the corner of his night vision goggles, but it was too late.&nbsp; He could feel the coarse threading of a large net as it came down over his body, nearly knocking him off the quad.&nbsp; In a reflexive action, he gunned the gas lever and the powerful ATV surged forward with a loud revving of the engine.&nbsp; The net was still all over him, and there seemed to be some weight on it.&nbsp; He could see through his goggles enough to notice a gloved hand on his right back fender, still holding onto the net&#8217;s lanyards.&nbsp; He leaned forward as far as he could and shifted down a gear to improve his ability to climb.&nbsp; He looked down and saw the hand no longer there, and the net also seemed to get lighter.&nbsp; In fact, he was able to move the net mostly off of him.&nbsp; That&#8217;s when something hit him about chest-high that removed him from the bike completely, leaving him looking straight up into the air at the tree limbs above him.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The line had been placed between two trees and had caught him with one arm in the air as he had attempted to remove the large net.&nbsp; His chest hurt awfully and he felt he would have a difficult time breathing, but he managed to get up as he knew the seriousness of his situation.&nbsp; 
He could hear footsteps approaching from behind him as well as what sounded like a female voice shouting out in pain.&nbsp; He instinctively ran up the hill.&nbsp; He could see his bike rolling on its own about 20 meters ahead of him, and then it hit a tree, stopping the engine.&nbsp; If he could get to it he might can start the engine again quickly and get away.&nbsp; He tried to run to the bike, despite the burning pain in his chest.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#8217;s when he felt the voltage hit him in the back, rendering him paralyzed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down he went, face-first into the leaves and dirt.&nbsp; His body was in such pain that he could not even catch a breath, much less make an articulated move.&nbsp; In rapid fashion, he could feel weight on his legs, his butt, and his upper shoulders, with more weight pressing directly down on his head, driving it into the ground further.&nbsp; He felt his hands being pulled around behind his back roughly, without regard given to the natural way his arms folded.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corporal Bridgette Abrams, with her knee firmly planted into Dale&#8217;s lower back-upper butt area, had one side of her high-security hinged handcuffs around the runner&#8217;s right wrist before she even drew it behind his back.&nbsp; His other wrist followed shortly thereafter, rendering his hands and arms virtually useless, with his palms facing outward, making it virtually impossible to let himself out of the restraints even with a key.&nbsp; She quickly double-locked the handcuffs to keep them from tightening further, although she had made every effort to put them on as tightly as possible to begin with.&nbsp; She looked back at&nbsp; private Melissa Onarsky, who was facing away from her, sitting on Dale&#8217;s legs, busily securing leg chains to his ankles.&nbsp; These had about 40cm of chain between them, enabling a shifty stride for walking but ruling running out entirely.&nbsp; In front of her,&nbsp; private Tonya Benson had one knee on the runner&#8217;s upper back, and was busy pulling the other knee off his head, replacing it quickly with her hand and pulling his night-vision goggles off.&nbsp; Once they were removed, she quickly put her palm down into the back of his head once more, pinning him down while the others finished restraining him.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other five women stood around the restraint team, one of them cursing and holding her injured hand, shaking it and looking it over closely under her night vision goggles.&nbsp; Beside her, one of the women was holstering a stun stick that she had used to incapacitate the runner.&nbsp; Her name was Sergeant Felicia Tompkins, and she would be in charge of delivering this prisoner to the closest detention facility.&nbsp; It was her squad that physically captured the prisoner.&nbsp; This was important; although all twelve members of the platoon would be credited for the arrest, any bonus compensation was based on who did what in a takedown.&nbsp; The ones that came into most physical contact with the prisoner during an arrest were awarded extra pay.&nbsp; That was Felicia&#8217;s squad in this case.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With his hands and feet chained, Dale writhed in agony as the effects of the shock took time to wear off.&nbsp;&nbsp; As Bridgette Adams stood up after securing his wrists, Melissa Ornasky moved off of his legs, turned around from his side, produced a short chain and a sturdy lock from one of the side pockets of her tight fatigue pants.&nbsp; She then pulled Dale&#8217;s feet up behind him near to his wrists, looped the short chain around the hinges of the handcuffs and the links of the leg chains, wrapped it around twice, and put the lock through two of the links, securing his feet to his arms.&nbsp; When this was done, Private Benson stood up from her position at Dale&#8217;s head and shoulders.&nbsp; Now all the weight was off of Dale, but he still struggled to breathe.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The four young women that had comprised the restraint team now stood over Dale, catching their own breath for a few moments.&nbsp; Bridgette put her foot onto Dale&#8217;s back, just to keep him from rolling down the hill, perhaps. The four women in the other squad had already turned their attention to his Yamaha quad, and one was climbing onto it to see if she could get it to start.&nbsp; He heard it rumble to life, and could hear the women discussing the best way to get it dislodged from the undergrowth where it had parked itself.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the four women that stood over him now started to talk.&nbsp; He could hear the radio one or more of them wore, getting a message about removing all traps and spikes.&nbsp; Dale figured they would not leave them here for another runner to hit and possibly hurt himself on.&nbsp; No, they would not want to actually damage a prisoner where he would not be able to get medical treatment and survive.&nbsp; A dead male prisoner was worthless to them.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the women in the other squad rode past him a few feet away on his bike, stopping to talk to the one to the one that had used the shock stick on him.&nbsp; It was agreed that the other squad would go collect all the traps and would take them back to their respective vehicles using Dale&#8217;s ATV.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another girl hopped onto the bike with her, and they rode off up the hill.&nbsp; The other two walked off toward the west, presumably back to their vehicle.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale finally managed to catch a breath, although his current hogtie position made it difficult.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sgt. Felicia Tompkins announced to her squad that it was a job well-done.&nbsp; She then instructed the two lower-ranking young ladies, Tonya and Melissa, to monitor Dale&#8217;s breathing.&nbsp; They were to remove the connector chain from his feet to his hands as soon as he started breathing again normally.&nbsp; Then they were to walk him back to the APV.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale rolled his head over as far as he could see, and noticed the Sergeant and Corporal Adams walking away from him a bit, also sensing the presence of the two privates standing over him.&nbsp; One of them, Tonya, the one that had mashed his head into the dirt, knelt down beside him now with relative kindness.&nbsp; She introduced herself by her first name, and informed Dale that he was under arrest for suspicion of violating one or more articles of the non-communication act, then told him she was now going to search him for weapons and identification.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without waiting for him to speak, she and Melissa both began running their hands all over Dale&#8217;s hogtied form.&nbsp; They patted him up and down his body, inside and between his legs, under his arms.&nbsp; Then one of them put her hands down into his pants.&nbsp; Any other time, this may have produced an exciting result, but her prisoner was still in a state of shock from the traumatic experience he had suffered moments before.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale had been armed with an SKS rifle that was mounted on the back of his quad, but it was long gone for him now and certainly not something he could have hidden on his person. All he had on him was a small survival knife, which Melissa promptly confiscated.&nbsp; He carried no identification, but it didn&#8217;t really matter to the women.&nbsp; They hadn&#8217;t even yet asked him his name.&nbsp; Perhaps they didn&#8217;t see the need to name livestock, he surmised.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale could barely see anything in the dark without his night vision goggles.&nbsp; He could only make out forms and shapes, and those not very well.&nbsp; The women&#8217;s hands stopped rummaging for contraband and he could feel one of them picking at his chains.&nbsp; Suddenly the connecting chain between the hinged cuffs and his leg irons were released, and his legs were allowed to relax back to the ground.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sergeant Tompkins and Corporal Adams walked back over to the chained male prisoner as the two privates were helping him to his feet, taking a position on either side of him, interlocking their arms through his elbows to support him as well as to secure him.&nbsp; As the young women helped him to his feet, he could smell their perfume and shampoo, and his face inadvertently brushed across the chest area of the one that had called herself Tonya.&nbsp; He noticed how soft she felt there, despite the harshness she had displayed when helping to get him restrained.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sergeant Tompkins instructed the girls to walk Dale back to the APV.&nbsp; Now able to speak, he protested that he could walk better without chains on his legs.&nbsp; Tonya took the opportunity to elbow him in the side- not very hard, but almost out of warning rather than to punish him.&nbsp; But it was too late, Sergeant Tompkins was up in his face in a split second, slapping him hard across the mouth.&nbsp; She informed him that his mouth was to be kept shut from here on out.&nbsp; Then she withdrew the shock stick and held it up to his face. Upon seeing the instrument of pain and anguish and having a freshly-gained respect for it, he nodded his head up and down as she barked at him, unable to muster a sound from his mouth.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly the five figures made their way down the hill, through the brush and low-hanging limbs.&nbsp; Dale could not see where he was going, and his chained feet struggled to keep up with the four women and their unencumbered legs.&nbsp; At times, the two women privates half-carried him along between their interlocked elbows.&nbsp; His hands trailed uselessly behind his back, making it difficult to balance himself, especially down the hilly terrain. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They finally arrived at the APC, and Corporal Adams opened the back hatch.&nbsp; Light poured out from inside, and all the women removed their night vision goggles.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sergeant Tompkins and Corporal Adams moved into the vehicle and went up towards the front of it to the drivers&#8217; seats.&nbsp; The sergeant instructed Tonya and Melissa to prep the prisoner for transport.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, Tonya moved around to face Dale and asked him if he needed to pee.&nbsp; Dale finally got a decent look at one of his captors.&nbsp; She was a very pretty girl in her early or mid 20&#8217;s, with dark hair and eyes. Her mouth was kind of smallish and her features angular but very feminine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �What??� Dale asked.&nbsp; Tonya informed Dale that they would be riding for as much as 80 kilometers and once secured into the vehicle, he would not be allowed to stop to use the bathroom.&nbsp; Dale had actually stopped to pee a little before his rendezvous with the mercenary squad, and told Tonya he didn&#8217;t need to go right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Very well, be very still now�, Tonya said as she nodded at Melissa, who still held Dale&#8217;s arm.&nbsp; Keeping the handcuffs and leg irons on, each of the girls produced fairly large knives and began to remove Dales clothing by cutting it off his body.&nbsp; In seconds, nothing was left, leaving Dale standing naked in the cold air.&nbsp; Both of the girls walked around in front of Dale after they had cut all his clothes off.&nbsp; They both eyed his flaccid penis hanging out in the breeze, and he felt that even though he was of average length, as cold as he was, it must certainly be shrinking before their very eyes.&nbsp; He felt so embarrassed, but had no choice but to stand there and endure the humiliation. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He noticed that Melissa was equally beautiful and roughly the same age as Tonya, but with lighter hair than her, and with lighter eyes, possibly blue but it was difficult to see in the light from the back of the APC.&nbsp; Both had their hair pulled back into pony tails and wore only light makeup.&nbsp; Both wore identical uniforms consisting of rather tight dark-colored fatigue pants with large pockets on the thighs, and both carried Glock pistols on their right hips.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, each had a utility belt with spare magazines, a couple of nondescript pouches with unknown contents, and each girl had one pouch directly under the center of her back.&nbsp; Out of the tops of these pouches he could make out the center hinges of handcuffs, which explained to him why there was so little flexibility between the cuffs on his wrists.&nbsp; On a quick-release ring around the back of Tonya&#8217;s belt he could see 4 or 5 long heavy white zip ties, he presumed to be used to restrain multiple prisoners in a riot situation. Both girls had very nice figures, accentuated by the tight fit of the fatigue pants, and cinched nicely at their waists by the equipment belts.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They wore short dark tight jackets with their last names on their pockets, and some type of company symbol on the shoulders.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Dale, however, he wore nothing except his metal restraints, and he was getting cold.&nbsp; He heard the large armored personnel carrier rumble to life, and the two girls promptly herded their prisoner into the back doorway of the vehicle.&nbsp; Tonya whispered softly to him �I know you&#8217;re cold- the exhaust will heat you a bit while we finish up here�.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale didn&#8217;t know why, but he had already sensed that Tonya had been kind to him under the circumstances, and now he was certain that she must have a soft spot for him.&nbsp; Melissa, who hadn&#8217;t spoken the first word to him, stepped up into the vehicle to retrieve something from a storage bin while Tonya held the hinges of his cuffed hands behind his back with one hand, placing the other hand on his right shoulder.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking the only opportunity he thought he may have, Dale turned his head back to Tonya and met her eyes with his.&nbsp; �Please, if you want to be nice to me, help me escape.� Dale whispered.&nbsp; Tonya said nothing but pulled down tighter on Dale&#8217;s wrists, simultaneously pulling down on his shoulder and bending him backward a little.&nbsp; Just then, Melissa turned back to the pair holding several items in her hands.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melissa spoke up as she approached Dale and Tonya.&nbsp; �Ok, it&#8217;s time to get you restrained for the trip to the detention facility.�&nbsp; Dale couldn&#8217;t believe what he was hearing.&nbsp; What did she mean &#8216;get him restrained&#8217;? Was he not already helplessly restrained as it was?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonya seemed to sense Dale&#8217;s incredulous reaction, and told him that certain measures must be utilized to ensure the safety of the prisoner and the crew during transport.&nbsp; With that she firmly instructed him to get to his knees, putting her own knees into the backs of his legs to emphasize the point and to destabilize him.&nbsp; His knees were on the ground almost immediately, and he did not struggle when she applied pressure to the back of his head, guiding him downward face-first onto the back floor of the APC.&nbsp; He sensed Melissa above him moving down out of the vehicle to take a position behind him to his left.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He could not recognize what was in her hand, a long leather device which she wrapped around his lower arms.&nbsp; An expanded area at the bottom completely encased his hands below the handcuffs.&nbsp; The expanded area tapered and forced his hands, which were inserted back-to-back, together all the way to the tips of his fingernails.&nbsp; His thumbs, however, protruded from small holes in the device, allowing him to wiggle them freely.&nbsp; The rest of his fingers, however, were completely immobilized now.&nbsp; Melissa tightened some laces and his hands were effectively welded together.&nbsp; Now she tightened a strap on the device up near Dale&#8217;s elbows.&nbsp; In doing so, she put a knee on his back and used all her strength to cinch is as tightly as she could, causing him to grunt in pain. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As she did this, Tonya reached from behind her belt and withdrew one of the large white zip ties.&nbsp; She wrapped it around Dale&#8217;s wrists directly above the handcuffs and pulled it nice and snug.&nbsp; With that, Melissa felt safe to remove Corporal Adam&#8217;s handcuffs from Dale&#8217;s wrists.&nbsp; She unlocked them and moved forward into the vehicle to return the strict restraints to Corporal Adams, who nonchalantly folded them and leaned forward in her seat to return them to the holder on her belt.&nbsp; She said nothing to Melissa as she was busy conversing with someone on the radio.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale did feel some relief with the removal of the handcuffs which had been applied cruelly tight.&nbsp; Still, he never felt the smallest amount of freedom.&nbsp; The large zip tie and the bottom of the single glove restraint device held him fast at the hands and wrists, and the top strap held his elbows.&nbsp; His elbows were not quite touching, but certainly closer together than was natural.&nbsp; Tonya cut the end of the zip tie off with a small pair of cutting pliers Melissa had brought for just that purpose.&nbsp; Rather than cutting the zip tie loose, she would just lace the glove up over it, providing extra security for her prisoner.&nbsp; She pulled the heavy leather lace hard and tight with every set of holes, and eventually got to the top near Dale&#8217;s elbows.&nbsp; She temporarily undid the strap that had been holding his elbows together, and finished lacing the glove up, putting the ends back down into the glove when she finished.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale didn&#8217;t say a word, partly worrying about what Tonya might be thinking, but primarily worried what Sergeant Tompkins would do to him if she caught him talking.&nbsp; As far as he knew, she was still up front in the APC, but he knew that as loud as the thing was and with his face buried in the floor of the vehicle, that she could be standing right over him now and he wouldn&#8217;t notice it.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Tonya finished lacing Dale&#8217;s arms up,&nbsp; she then went back to the straps.&nbsp; One went directly over the place at his wrists where the zip tie was, offering triple security in that location.&nbsp; There was another strap at the forearms, and one more at the elbows.&nbsp; Two more long straps went around on each side of Dale&#8217;s neck, crossing each other at his chest, and returned back under his arms to secure the entire contraption to his body.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Melissa had returned and produced a large heavy thick collar and proceeded to put it around Dale&#8217;s neck.&nbsp; From the collar hung a strap that buckled to another strap which was made into the top of Dale&#8217;s single glove restraint, from the area between his elbows.&nbsp; The buckle had a place for a small lock where the two pieces joined, and a small sturdy lock was promptly snapped into place.&nbsp; He was now firmly and inescapably secured into the single glove restraint.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonya reached into the pile of items Melissa had brought forth earlier and withdrew a small device, holding it up to Dale&#8217;s face, softly muttering the word �thumbcuffs� to him as she moved around behind him, snapping them onto his wiggling thumbs.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �You need to stand up now� Melissa told him as she and Tonya pulled up on Dale&#8217;s welded-together arms.&nbsp; He grunted in discomfort as they pulled him up, but then he found his feet and was able to stand mostly unassisted.&nbsp; Melissa and Tonya instructed him to put his weight on their shoulders and lift his feet up to get into the APC, which he did.&nbsp; They stood him up over a cot-sized bench that ran perpendicular to the length of the vehicle.&nbsp; The bench was covered with what looked to be a big piece of thick canvas.&nbsp; They told him they would ease him down onto it face-down.&nbsp; He again complied, and quickly Melissa went to work on his legs, strapping them together above and below his knees.&nbsp; When his upper legs were firmly secured, she removed the leg irons, promptly replacing them with a wide leather strap tight around his ankles. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonya, in the meantime, had to go to the front of the vehicle to confer with the corporal and the sergeant.&nbsp; When she got to the front, Dale had a good view of her shapely backside as she squatted down between the seats.&nbsp; As she bent down, he noticed she was wearing a thong as the strap became visible over the top of her fatigue pants.&nbsp; Very nice, he thought, and for the first time since his capture, he began to feel aroused.&nbsp;&nbsp; She turned back to look at him as she spoke to her superiors.&nbsp; He could not hear what was being said over the engine noise, but he saw her shaking her head up and down, and then back and forth, and then up and down again.&nbsp; Finally she turned around and asked Melissa if she was ready.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ready for what ?&nbsp; Before he could wonder about it long, he felt Melissa pull his strapped legs up behind him again, and he could feel her attaching some type of cord or strap from his bound ankles to a large metal ring on the wrist strap of his single glove.&nbsp; Tonya was directly in front of Dale while this was being done, and Dale was about thigh-level to her, his face only inches from her crotch.&nbsp; She leaned in forward a bit as Melissa pulled firmly on the attachment between Dale&#8217;s arm and leg restraints, putting him once again into a tight hogtie.&nbsp; Tonya&#8217;s hand rested on his head momentarily, almost petting him while the hogtie was being applied, perhaps out of pity for him, perhaps to keep her balance� he didn&#8217;t know. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was actually tighter than the hogtie the restraint team had applied to him earlier with the chains and shackles, mostly because of the tightness of the single glove, he figured.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melissa secured the attachment strap holding Dale&#8217;s single glove firmly to his ankles, and put a lock through the ring to hold it in place.&nbsp; After she was finished, she looked over at Tonya and nodded with a quick smile, and patted Dale firmly on his naked butt cheek to finalize his predicament.&nbsp; Nothing like a butt-pat to make the prisoner realize the extent to which he is helpless, she figured.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, Tonya went back over behind Dale to the dwindling pile of items Melissa had laid out. When she came back she knelt down beside him and explained that she had seen no need for it, but that the sergeant and the corporal had ordered Dale to receive what is known as the &#8216;head treatment&#8217;.&nbsp;&nbsp; This meant he would be gagged for the trip, so as to be unable to garner sympathy from any of his captors by pleading with them.&nbsp; Also, she had been ordered to blindfold him and plug his ears so as to keep him from seeing or hearing any information that may be discussed during the trip.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonya bent down further and whispered quickly into Dale&#8217;s ear �I&#8217;m very sorry�.&nbsp; Melissa then handed her some soft putty wax, which she promptly stuffed into Dale&#8217;s ear canals, one at a time.&nbsp; Dale did not resist, moving his head from one side to the other with only a slight prompting from Tonya&#8217;s hand.&nbsp; Melissa then handed her a full-harness ballgag, which she strapped onto Dale&#8217;s head.&nbsp; She waited until after she had tightened every last strap, at the top and sides and in front of his chin, as long as possible before she fitted the big black rubber ball into his mouth behind his teeth.&nbsp; She knew it would be quite uncomfortable and actually would start hurting his jaws after time.&nbsp; No sense in beginning that discomfort any sooner than necessary, she figured.&nbsp; Once it was in his mouth, however, she did take proper care to tighten it in securely.&nbsp; The sergeant would be furious if the ball came out for any reason.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next came the blindfold, which attached to the harness for the ballgag.&nbsp; It had six snaps and was relatively quick to put onto Dale.&nbsp; Tonya&#8217;s was the last face he saw as she fitted the covering over his eyes.&nbsp; Then came earphones, similar to what is used at a gun range to protect hearing.&nbsp; Here she used these in conjunction with the wax she had put into his ears to keep him from hearing anything.&nbsp; He was truly deprived of his senses at this point. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now came the final restraint:&nbsp; Dale could only feel as Melissa and Tonya pulled up on the canvas he had laid on earlier.&nbsp; They pulled it up and back around him, connecting eyelets on opposite sides of the canvas bundling bag with small locking rings, the kind often used by rock climbers.&nbsp; Then they pulled four separate chains, also with larger locking rings at each end, from a heavy steel frame situated above the bench.&nbsp; They attached these larger rings to the smaller rings that held the bag closed.&nbsp; While attaching these, they hoisted him up one corner at a time so he now hung in the bag a few centimeters off the bench.&nbsp; Once the bag with their prisoner inside was hanging, the girls took 3 large leather straps and wrapped them firmly around the bag to further secure it. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale was now firmly hogtied, tightly bundled inside the thick canvas bag with only his head sticking out one end, and deprived of his senses.&nbsp; Tonya noticed Dale&#8217;s head hanging down, and instructed Melissa to hand her a small connecting chain which she affixed to a D-ring on the back of his harness gag.&nbsp; The other end she attached to the frame above him, pulling it upwards until his head was in an upright position.&nbsp; She then locked the chain into place with a small padlock.&nbsp; This supported Dale&#8217;s head and would keep him from straining his neck downward, although it would significantly restrict his freedom of movement.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The all-clear was given to the drivers, and Dale could feel the vehicle start to move.&nbsp; He was now moving toward an uncertain fate but was completely helpless to do anything about it.

Postapocalypto - Chapter 2


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale had been standing naked in the cold just a few moments earlier, but now he began to feel quite warm, tucked away tightly inside the canvas restraint bag.&nbsp; His body was in a strained position, strapped into a strict hogtie and hanging in the bag from a rack on the ceiling of the APC.&nbsp; The bag with him inside swayed back and forth, to and fro, as the vehicle traversed the countryside.&nbsp; Occasionally he would notice the soft but firm feeling of a hand on his head or shoulders, steadying his body when it swayed too violently.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His senses of sight and sound were rendered totally useless by the blindfold and the ear putty, along with the earphones.&nbsp; His entire body was covered by the bag, except for his head which stuck out the front side.&nbsp; His jaw was beginning to ache from being stretched by the ball gag jammed behind his teeth.&nbsp; All efforts on his part to shove it out of his mouth were unsuccessful.&nbsp; With the way his head was restrained/supported from the rack above, he had to focus just to get a good breath around the mouth-filling restraint.&nbsp; Although he tried to hold it back, he began to drool after only a few short minutes.&nbsp; Soon it was dribbling down his chin and neck, but he was powerless to stop it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He knew little except that he was headed for some type of detention facility.&nbsp; He did not know what his fate would be there, but he was fairly certain that he need not fear for his life.&nbsp; Males were simply too precious a commodity in this world to &#8216;waste&#8217; one.&nbsp; Even violent criminals were spared any form of the death penalty.&nbsp; 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, most male criminal inmates enjoyed unlimited conjugal visitation.&nbsp; In the event of a particularly violent offender, a prisoner would be heavily restrained for the occasion, so as not to hurt his female visitors. The leniency granted violent men was juxtaposed by the fact any man could be jailed for almost any infraction, even minor traffic violations.&nbsp; Once a man was caught up in the legal system, it was difficult for him to get out of it without significant prison time or political connections.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was as if the female legislative branch passed laws specifically intended to incarcerate men and keep them there where they would be &#8216;safe&#8217;.&nbsp; Furthermore, they made laws that were very difficult to interpret and highly subjective to a judge&#8217;s interpretation.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, over a quarter of all men living in regions controlled by the major governments in the world were in prison, many having served years on trumped-up charges resulting from the most insignificant violations.&nbsp; Bail was not permitted for men awaiting a trial of any kind, and often trials were set many months or even years away from the initial arrest. All types of legal reasons were given for these situations, but everyone suspected the real reason for the unfairness:&nbsp; Men in prison were used for black-market purposes such as prostitution and outright slavery.&nbsp; Many in the female majority knew of it, but few had reason to fight the system, unless it happened to be a male relative of their own.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonya sat in a jump seat near the front of Dale&#8217;s suspended body, resting her hand on his shoulder, trying to keep him from swinging back and forth too violently with the motion of the APC as it plodded along.&nbsp; The restraint rack was specifically-designed to hold a man the way it now held Dale,&nbsp;&nbsp; (allowing him to suspend a few centimeters in midair as a way to nullify any attempts at achieving any leverage) but there were times Tonya felt he may hit his head on the vehicle&#8217;s interior as the APC crossed hilly terrain. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonya looked across Dale&#8217;s hogtied form at Melissa, who returned her look with a light grin.&nbsp; Tonya and Melissa both had been quite happy to have Dale at their mercy for the past half hour or so.&nbsp; Although both girls, like most women their age, had a vast array of dildos and vibrating toys, neither girl had ever had a real man before and both had made sure to check Dale very closely for �weapons�.&nbsp; They had both attended submission and restraint training courses when they served in the military, but most of the hands-on practice they got at subduing, restraining, or searching anyone was on other girls in the class.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both girls wore black company-issue thong panties under their tight fatigue pants, stringy little numbers that left little to the imagination.&nbsp; Basically these thongs had a tiny 7 or 8 cm triangle of cloth in the back at the top between the buttocks connected by a thin string to a slightly larger triangle covering the front.&nbsp; The sides were little more than strings as well. Tonya wasn&#8217;t sure about Melissa, but she knew that her thong&#8217;s little front triangle was completely soaked at this point.&nbsp; She wiggled in her seat as the vehicle plodded along, thinking about how Dale&#8217;s penis felt in her hands when she had frisked him�to date her only sexual experience whatsoever with any man.&nbsp; She maintained a firm steady hand on his shoulders, possibly more out of the desire to touch Dale than to protect his head.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unbeknownst to Tonya, Melissa shifted in her seat with a moisture problem of her own.&nbsp; While Tonya had been quick to offer a word or gesture of warmth to Dale, Melissa had not said much to him aside from ordering him around.&nbsp; She feared the wrath of the Sergeant, a beautiful but cold-hearted woman of the age of 30 or so.&nbsp; Rumors circulated that the Sergeant was a lesbian, but nobody had ever been able to prove it.&nbsp; She never had a kind word to say to a prisoner or even to any of her subordinates.&nbsp; She usually just barked orders at them and that was it.&nbsp; Melissa had wanted to free Dale the moment she saw him standing there naked in chains and jump into his arms and wrap her legs around him, but she knew better than to make that fantasy known to anyone else.&nbsp; Still, she fantasized as she squirmed in her jump seat.&nbsp; 
________________________________________________

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The APCs motored on into the night and soon encountered early morning sunrise from the east.&nbsp; The outpost was only a few miles away now, and Sergeant Tompkins prepared her report to submit to the commander of the outpost, a certain Lieutenant Lorena Simmons.&nbsp; Corporal Abrams drove the vehicle as Tompkins entered data into the computer.&nbsp; Although the women were a bit older than the two in the back, their imaginations were running wild at the thought of the cargo they carried, and their company-issued thongs were no less moist than those of their young comrades.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sergeant Felicia Tompkins was a by-the-book kind of gal.&nbsp; She did not let anything come between her and completing a mission.&nbsp; While she certainly had feelings, she was not the type to show them to anyone, especially her enemies.&nbsp; To her, the mission was the bound and gagged gentleman in the back of the vehicle and getting him to the intended destination.&nbsp; When that mission was accomplished, perhaps she would let the prisoner know that hitting him across the face earlier was nothing personal.&nbsp; An apology from this woman was not going to happen.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sergeant Tompkins knew other women in her platoon thought she was a lesbian.&nbsp; Little did any of them know that she had an arrangement back home with certain well-connected friends.&nbsp; As a result of this arrangement, she had men quite regularly.&nbsp; Not all of those men were willing participants, but they all participated with her, nonetheless.&nbsp; Her needs were taken care of.&nbsp; She even had a daughter by one of her conquests.&nbsp; Having a man when she needed one allowed her to focus better on her career.&nbsp; Still, the thought of Dale hanging in the bundling bag was difficult to clear from her mind as she attempted to stay on track with her data-entry.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, Cpl. Bridgette Adams drove toward her destination.&nbsp; She, like the other women, had a job to do but found concentrating on that task a bit difficult in light of the passenger they carried.&nbsp; Corporal Adams was 25. Unlike the younger girls in her squad, she had enjoyed a man on a few occasions.&nbsp; She was not wealthy or influential like the Sergeant but had managed a few black market liaisons.&nbsp; She had actually joined the company after her stint in the military in the hopes that it would put her in close proximity to men on a more regular basis.&nbsp; She had been working for the company for about 3 years, and had several captures under her belt.&nbsp; Captures had been a little sparse lately, however, and Bridgette felt lucky to have been in the squad to take this prisoner down. She was now closer to a male than she had been for quite a few months.&nbsp; She hoped for some guard duty when the platoon arrived back at the base.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale, completely immobilized and his senses nullified by the application of so many restraints, swung back and forth in the bundling bag, left to his own thoughts.&nbsp; He thought about his home and family that he would probably not see again. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He, his mother and stepfather had moved to the colony when Dale was nine.&nbsp; His own father had died in the great conflict, along with most every other man on earth.&nbsp; Although he had become extremely ill and had nearly died, Dale ultimately survived, one of the lucky few to do so with no brain damage.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his mid 20&#8217;s, Dale was approaching retirement age for a runner.&nbsp; Most runners began their careers at the age of 18.&nbsp; The job was fraught with the danger of being captured and never heard from again, but it paid very, very well, as the delivery of coded messages was the only form of communication between the colonies.&nbsp; If money was handled well, retirement could come very early on, long before a man reached his 30th birthday.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Runners were taught early on in their training advanced survival skills, and could live for months or even years alone in the wilderness, if needed.&nbsp; They were very resourceful and were taught combat and escape techniques.&nbsp; The idea was that you ran until you had to fight, fought until you were killed or captured, and did everything within reason to escape once captured.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a rash of successful escapes early after the non-communications act was implemented, the women charged with the capture of these lawbreakers realized that the men they were capturing had specific training to defeat common methods of incarceration.&nbsp; They could pick handcuff locks using everyday items, overpower their women captors even if outnumbered slightly, and were masterful at finding their way out of even reasonably secure buildings.&nbsp; Soon these women devised strict methods of restraint to discourage any attempts to free oneself once captured.&nbsp; Captured prisoners were immediately stripped, searched, and restrained with double, triple, or even quadruple redundancy.&nbsp; They were typically captured by teams of at least a dozen females specifically trained for the task.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of the methods of restraint were researched and implemented with operational input provided by practitioners of bondage and discipline, many of those practitioners carrying the title of Dominatrix.&nbsp; While the BDSM community for centuries had been relegated to the status of one of humanity&#8217;s dirty little secrets, some of its members soon found jobs as highly-paid consultants to government and private security forces, constantly upgrading and developing new methods of capture and restraint, many of which were almost medieval in nature.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most missions involved running between colonies, but occasionally a mission may include a foray into the female-dominated government controlled areas.&nbsp; An underground system had developed to smuggle men and their families out of these areas and into the relative freedom of the colonies.&nbsp; These missions were most dangerous, and left to the most experienced of runners. Dale had planned to train for those missions to round out his career, and was going to retire after a few of those. These assignments paid much more than standard missions.&nbsp; But now, after dozens of successful runs that had possibly dulled Dale&#8217;s senses and given him a sense of complacency, here he was, hanging hogtied from a restraint rack in an enemy vehicle.

________________________________________________________ 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near daybreak, the three APCs pulled one by one into the main security gate at the detention center.&nbsp; There were no other entrances or exits to the complex, and aside from the large stone pillars at each side of the front gate, the rest of the outer perimeter consisted of an ultra high-security double fence.&nbsp; This fence, on both the inner and outer layers, had plentiful wrappings of razor wire at the top and all along the bottom of the fencing, with yet another larger roll of razor wire standing alone down between the two layers.&nbsp; So in order for one to escape, one would need to navigate 3 sections of razor wire.&nbsp; This was in addition to seven guard towers situated along the outer perimeter.&nbsp; From these towers, guards monitored their areas both visually and with the aid of multiple electronic devices, such as infrared and other sensors.&nbsp; The facility&#8217;s inmates, however, never actually saw its outer areas as it was standard procedure to blindfold incoming residents.&nbsp; Assuming a prisoner or group of prisoners ever breached the inner security measures of the facility, which was itself quite unlikely, there would be no way to plan for what was beyond the walls of the central detention complex.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two APCs carrying the other squads drove around to a secure parking area in the rear of the facility.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the APC carrying Dale and his captors pulled to an unloading area inside a long narrow building attached to the main building, one with an oversized steel door on each end that allowed a large vehicle to pull straight through.&nbsp; The APC pulled into the front door and parked at the base of the entrance ramp leading to the main door of the detention facility.&nbsp; As soon as the vehicle was all the way inside the building, the outer door quickly closed itself securely behind it.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the vehicle rolled to a stop, Tonya and Melissa rose from their jump seats and folded them up.&nbsp; Sgt. Tompkins, with her personal computer under her arm, had already began moving toward the back of the vehicle and soon she had the large back gate open.&nbsp; She instructed the young women in the back with the prisoner to prepare him for his walk inside, and with that she exited the vehicle and disappeared around the corner, in the direction of the concrete ramp.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melissa and Tonya worked together to remove the straps around the canvas bag Dale was in.&nbsp; They then started to unclip the chains holding Dale&#8217;s trussed-up body aloft, and soon he was resting firmly on the cot below him.&nbsp; They began to unfasten the clips holding the bundling bag closed, and soon they could see his naked body again.&nbsp; To the girls, it was like unwrapping a birthday gift.&nbsp; Dale had gone from shivering and cold to being quite warm and had broken a sweat which gleamed in little beads all over his backside.&nbsp; Melissa removed the connector strap between Dale&#8217;s bound ankles and his single glove arm binder. As she did so Dale felt instantaneous relief in his cramped muscles, at least those in his knees and legs.&nbsp; He could feel the straps above and below his knees being removed one at a time, and then the strap at his ankles.&nbsp; As his ankles were freed, he moved his legs around a bit to try to work the muscles loose, but Melissa immediately put a knee down across them to discourage movement.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, Tonya removed Dale&#8217;s earphones and the head harness, popping the rubber ball out from behind his teeth.&nbsp; As she pulled it away, strings of saliva hung between the device and his face momentarily, as he had been drooling profusely for the entire trip.&nbsp; Tonya had noticed this and was immediately on the spot with a cloth towel to wipe Dale&#8217;s face and the area below him on the cot where the drool had collected.&nbsp; When she finished, she then began to reach into Dale&#8217;s ears to retrieve the putty she had lodged into them earlier. The girls made no attempt to remove any of Dale&#8217;s arm or hand restraints, not even the thumb cuffs.&nbsp; These would remain, at least for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale felt exhausted and his muscles ached, not only from the stringent restraints used on him for the journey in the APC, but his chest still ached from where he had been clothes-lined and removed from his APC.&nbsp; Not only that, but he could still almost feel the thousands of volts of energy from the Sergeant&#8217;s shock stick.&nbsp; Given that, at this point he was feeling much relieved with the removal of the leg and head restraints.&nbsp; His jaw felt better, especially.&nbsp; At times during the trip he had been unable to determine what felt worse: his jaw, his legs, or his arms which were still pulled together behind him tightly.&nbsp; But two out of three of the situations were now rectified for him. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked around and his eyes began adjusting to the light.&nbsp; He saw Tonya first thing, and was now watching her put several items into a plastic mesh bag, the head harness and several leather straps among those items.&nbsp; She was turned around facing away from him, and he had a dog&#8217;s eye view of her shapely ass, jiggling around inside her form-fitting uniform pants.&nbsp; Once again, her visible thong straps caught his attention and stimulated his imagination.&nbsp; Hanging low on her hips was her utility belt, with a variety of different pouches.&nbsp; He could make out her sidearm, what looked to be extra ammo clips, hinged handcuffs, and a phone or possibly walkie-talkie.&nbsp; Despite his discomforts, Dale could not ignore the urge to strip away all her tools and clothes and bend her over for some hard, fast, doggie action.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melissa was still half standing, half resting one knee on the backs of Dale&#8217;s legs.&nbsp; She could see what Dale was staring at from her position behind him, and thought to herself that it was good he was not queer, because being homosexual would make his captivity that much more difficult..
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Tonya finished putting the sweaty and saliva-covered restraints in the cleaning bag, she turned around and told Dale that she and Melissa would help him sit up now.&nbsp; They each helped him to roll over on his side, swing his legs over onto the floor, and sit up on the cot.&nbsp; As soon as this was done, Melissa retrieved the leg irons that she had restrained him with upon his capture.&nbsp; Kneeling down in front of him, she quickly ratcheted the cuffs around each of his ankles.&nbsp; As she did this, Tonya kept one hand on his shoulder and the other on top of his left knee, effectively holding him still and providing discouragement for any attempt to use his temporarily-freed legs.&nbsp; When the leg restraints were locked on, Melissa then attached a connector chain between them and up to a D-ring at the very bottom of Dale&#8217;s arm binder.&nbsp; She adjusted the connector chain to the proper length as Tonya stood Dale up.&nbsp; She then locked the chain into place with tiny padlocks, allowing just enough chain for Dale to stand, but not enough for him to stretch very far.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale stood in the rear hatch of the APC, and could see outside of it enough to know that they were in some large garage-type area, but all he could make out was a gray floor and block wall, illuminated in bright flourescent lighting.&nbsp; His look around was quickly abbreviated as Tonya stood in front of him with a black leather contraption.&nbsp; As she raised the hood up to put it on Dale&#8217;s head, he turned his neck and attempted to retract from her advance.&nbsp; This action was met immediately with an unequal, adverse reaction from Melissa, who now stood behind Dale, as she grabbed him with her left arm around his neck and simultaneously reached around his waist, grabbing and squeezing his scrotum in her right hand.&nbsp; This caused Dale to lose his balance, and he found himself bent slightly backwards, depending on Melissa for all support.&nbsp; Melissa whispered into Dale&#8217;s ear �It would be better if you didn&#8217;t struggle anymore�.&nbsp; It was all Dale needed to hear, given the uncomfortable amount of pressure Melissa was applying to his testicles.&nbsp; A slightly more emphatic squeeze on her part could result in serious pain, he surmised, and he&#8217;d had enough pain for the morning.&nbsp; He nodded his head north and south to signal to Melissa that he was on board as Tonya, with a look of determination, pulled the hood around Dale&#8217;s head.&nbsp; Once it was in place to some degree, she reached around behind his head to pull the zipper downward to tighten it.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melissa still held Dale in his compromising and unbalanced position, bracing herself against the inner wall of the APC.&nbsp; She knew that Dale understood that resistance would be met with quick and certain physical discomfort, and even though he had acknowledged this, she continued to hold his genitalia in her right hand firmly.&nbsp; This was a common submission hold practiced by all military and corporate security forces, but she had never had the opportunity to actually apply the technique on a real live male.&nbsp; Now she was going to make the most of this moment, as it was one she had long awaited inwardly.&nbsp; From the time she had attended basic defense and restraint training, the very thought of this particular situation would make her little cotton triangle wet.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By feel alone, Tonya fastened four small straps over the zipper, more snugly fitting the hood to Dale&#8217;s head.&nbsp; As she was busy doing this, Dale wondered just how long his most prized equipment would be at risk to the woman behind him.&nbsp; Now that the initial, more forceful squeezing was over, Melissa had loosened her grip somewhat, and now only firmly held his package.&nbsp; Despite Dale&#8217;s unwillingness to be in this particular situation, he suddenly found himself being aroused by the girl&#8217;s grip on him.&nbsp; Tonya was not helping matters, pressing up against his crotch as she finished buckling the final strap.&nbsp; As she finished with the straps, she then began to button the bottom flaps of Dale&#8217;s hood to snaps on his thick collar.&nbsp; The collar was multi-functional, and while designed to hold the arm binder and had snaps to attach to a hood or head harness, it also had large sturdy D-rings on the front and back.&nbsp; As she was buttoning, she felt something pressing into her lower abdomen.&nbsp; Pulling back from Dale a bit and looking down, she could see what had come between them, and she began to smile uncontrollably.&nbsp; She continued to fidget with the buttons on the hood, but not quite as dutifully as before. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, Melissa could feel Dale&#8217;s cock becoming larger and firmer as she held his testicles in her hand.&nbsp; She started to adjust her grip to accommodate the extra flesh suddenly present in her grip.&nbsp; Now she held more meat than it was possible to hold in one of her hands.&nbsp; The thought of what it must look like from Tonya&#8217;s point of view almost made her dizzy with lust.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonya was similarly affected by the turn of events in the region of Dale&#8217;s groin.&nbsp; As she smoothed out the seams on Dale&#8217;s hood, lining up his mouth and eye cutouts, she continued to find reason to look downwards.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �They do that sometimes��
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both girls jumped a bit at the break in the silence, looking to the front of the vehicle where Corporal Bridgette Adams was busily making her way to the rear where they were.&nbsp; The girls snapped back into reality, their little fantasies suddenly interrupted.&nbsp; Melissa&#8217;s grip on Dale&#8217;s erect unit remained, but he could immediately notice an increase in pressure at Bridgette&#8217;s appearance.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bridgette slapped Dale&#8217;s left ass cheek as she got closer, and focused on the erect penis attached to the prisoner, grabbing it and inspecting it like she would any rare and valuable item.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Be sure and leash him up when you&#8217;re finished with the other restraints� she said to Tonya, as she dropped Dale&#8217;s sausage and moved out the back of the APC.&nbsp; As her boots hit the floor, she turned around once more and grinned to Tonya and Melissa, �I don&#8217;t mean by his collar, either�.&nbsp; Then she disappeared around the back corner of the vehicle.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonya and Melissa instantly met each other with wide smiles.&nbsp; Cock restraints were only used on the most violent and hard-to-control prisoners, as a deterrent to bad behavior, but also as a method to demoralize a detainee and, via humiliation and helplessness, break his will to resist.&nbsp; Typically, a prisoner that offered no resistance was not restrained to this level, at least not in any &#8216;official&#8217; capacity.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale was not stupid, and figured out immediately what the corporal meant about �leashing him up�.&nbsp; His cock was already at full attention, and the idea of what they were going to do made him even more sexually excited, even though his logical self waged a losing battle, knowing that further restraint equaled an ever-dwindling chance of ever seeing his home or his family again.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melissa&#8217;s left arm, which had held Dale&#8217;s neck in a death grip earlier, had moved down to his upper chest making way for Tonya to fasten the snaps from his hood to his collar.&nbsp; She continued to hold Dale off-balance as Tonya finished her application of fresh head restraints.&nbsp; Tonya, continuing to sport a slight grin, looked into Dale&#8217;s blue eyes as she placed a soft leather blinder over the cutout for his eyes.&nbsp; It snapped into place with six snaps, very similar to the blinder on the harness gag she had applied earlier.&nbsp; Dale did not resist, and as before, Tonya&#8217;s face was the last he saw as he lost his freedom of vision.&nbsp; Before the restraint was applied, he noticed Tonya&#8217;s pupils were quite dilated, pushing aside her brown irises and making them appear pencil-thin.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale then felt something at his lips, pressing against them�he dreaded another large rubber ball in his mouth, but knew that resistance would be met with pain, so he opened up.&nbsp; Tonya inserted a piece of soft rubber into Dale&#8217;s mouth, then proceeded to apply and very firmly tighten two retention straps that circumnavigated Dale&#8217;s head, one buckling at the base of his skull, and the other that went over the tops of his ears and buckled at the back of his head.&nbsp; This device did not seem to be nearly as mouth-stretching as the first one, at least until he heard a&nbsp; whishing sound as Tonya began to inflate the infernal device!&nbsp; Within about a dozen presses of the bulb at the other end of the pump gag, Dale&#8217;s mouth was completely full, and his breathing again became something he would need to concentrate on.&nbsp; Dale began to struggle as Tonya approached the final two pumps, more out of panic than out of any attempt to escape.&nbsp; He attempted to shove the device out of his mouth, but Tonya had secured the device quite effectively.&nbsp; Melissa still held his bound body firmly, and re-applied the squeeze to his testicles.&nbsp; Tonya let go of the air bladder and let it hang a few inches below Dale&#8217;s chin, then put her hands on Dale&#8217;s chest, trying to soothe him a bit.&nbsp; Both girls then began to try to calm Dale down, both speaking firmly but calmly to him, and Tonya shhhhh&#8217;d him until his body finally stopped writhing, telling him that she would not pump the gag any more.&nbsp; Dale calmed somewhat now that the pumping had ceased.&nbsp; He had certainly wondered when it was going to end, if his jaw would break, and if he would be able to breathe.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the girls&#8217; attention moved to Dale&#8217;s rock-hard member, which stood straight out from the top of Melissa&#8217;s right hand.&nbsp; Opening a compartment, one of many in the APC that held varied restraint devices, Tonya retrieved a chain leash about 1.5 meters in length, with a heavy leather handle and a spring hook on the same end to shorten the leash if needed.&nbsp; On the other end of the leash was a steel cuff, hinged in the middle similar to a handcuff but smaller.&nbsp; It ratcheted shut to varying degrees, according to the size required.&nbsp; Unlike a handcuff, the teeth were on the inside of the device.&nbsp; This prevented soft skin such as that found in the area of the male scrotum from being caught inside the teeth and streamlined the outer surface to make the device somewhat less painful to wear.&nbsp; Melissa removed her hand from Dale&#8217;s scrotum, only to grab the shaft of his penis, which she held up for Tonya so she could apply the restraint without having a distracting obstacle to navigate.&nbsp; Tonya clicked the adjustable scrotum ring into place, tightening it securely so it would not come off. The device used a standard handcuff key.&nbsp; With the pin at the end of the key, Tonya pushed into the little hole on the side of the lock mechanism to double-lock the device.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale&#8217;s &#8216;maximum pedestrian restraint&#8217; package had been successfully applied by the girls, and soon they were helping him down onto the floor of the entrance garage.&nbsp; He would not see where he was going, but he would be able to hear instructions as they were given to him.&nbsp; Melissa, no longer holding him by his genitalia, instructed Dale to respond to any instructions by shaking his head up and down or side to side.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonya followed up Melissa&#8217;s instructions. �It is important that you follow instructions now, sir.&nbsp; Some of the people in this facility are not as lenient as we are, and not following instructions can have unfortunate consequences.&nbsp; Do you understand?� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale nodded his head up and down in the general direction of her voice, as the girls took positions on either side of him.&nbsp; Tonya held the leash in her left hand and put her right hand on Dale&#8217;s left shoulder blade as Melissa put her hand on Dale&#8217;s other shoulder.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonya added �We have a walk ahead of us, through processing and to your cell, and we understand your feet are chained, so we will go a little slowly for you.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t let me catch you dragging, though, or I will be expected to pull on this�.&nbsp; Tonya pulled the slack out of the lead chain, causing pressure to be applied to Dale&#8217;s balls.&nbsp; Dale nodded his head up and down vigorously and emitted a grunt from behind the air-filled rubber bladder that filled his mouth.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; The threesome headed from the back of the APC towards the main security door, which was up a large concrete ramp about 100 feet long.&nbsp; As Dale shuffled along up the ramp between his beautiful captors, Bridgette looked down from in front of the door.&nbsp; Having ordered the application of the ball leash, she had managed to refocus the attention of the two privates in her squad, which at that point had begun to deteriotate.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not to mention, ordering the use of the potentially-cruel device had satisfied a secret dominant urge inside her to control a man, to have him by the balls, so to speak.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale, moving at about half walking-speed as a result of his leg restraints, finally reached the top of the ramp, accompanied on each side by Tonya and Melissa.&nbsp; The guard on the other side of the door, having already admitted the Sergeant a few minutes earlier, pushed the button to release the deadbolts on the large steel door.&nbsp; It clicked open and the buzzing sound continued as the prisoner and the three young women made their way inside.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The large door closed behind them with a loud thud.&nbsp; The buzzing ceased, and Dale found himself one level deeper into an inescapable situation.


End of Chapter 2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 









&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale shuffled along between his two primary captors, Melissa and Tonya, followed closely behind by Corporal Abrams.&nbsp; His feet were chained closely together, shortening his normal stride by less than half.&nbsp; Each elbow was held by one of the girls as he walked, Melissa on his left, Tonya on his right. The young women were forced to shorten their own strides to accommodate his.&nbsp; Tonya held the leash attached to Dale&#8217;s scrotum in her hand, but mercifully she did not pull too hard on it.&nbsp; She had obeyed orders to use the device, but personally saw no need to torture her prisoner unless his behavior warranted her doing so.&nbsp; They walked down a brightly-lit central hallway, past several metal doors on each side as well as other hallways that went to various parts of the complex.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally they arrived at a guard station and stopped.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Dale was blindfolded and could only see pitch black, he had been counting his steps.&nbsp; It had been about 20 of his abbreviated steps from the APC to the ramp, about 100 short steps up that ramp, and he had taken about 200 steps before stopping here.&nbsp; In his mind he was making a map in the event he could ever find a way to free himself.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Dale did not know was the extent to which the wardens of the facility had gone to nullify just such an attempt by a prisoner to map out an escape route.&nbsp; As Dale and his little entourage got to the guard station, they walked him up to a round metal plate in the floor, a little under a half-meter in diameter.&nbsp; Melissa unfastened the connecting chain from the D-ring on Dale&#8217;s arm binder, the one attached to his leg restraints.&nbsp; She then took that chain, looped it through several times between his leg chain and a large eye hook which rose from the center of the metal plate he was standing on.&nbsp; She intentionally left almost no slack in the chain between his ankles and the hook. She finished securing the chain with a small lock.&nbsp; Now Dale&#8217;s feet were tightly chained down to the floor.&nbsp; When Melissa finished her task, Tonya bent Dale over forward, pulling up on his arms and hands, putting him in an uncomfortable position.&nbsp; Melissa then reached up and grabbed a chain hanging from the ceiling, one with a swivel hook at the bottom.&nbsp; She attached the hook to the D-ring on the tip of Dale&#8217;s arm binder.&nbsp; One of the guards at the station pushed a button and the chain raised up into the ceiling a bit, then stopped as she deemed Dale to be sufficiently bent forward and helpless to stand upright, with significant tension on his chain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonya then took the end of the leash attached to Dale&#8217;s balls and stuck it into one of the straps on Dale&#8217;s gag, to hold it temporarily.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as Dale was properly restrained between the metal plate and the chain from the ceiling, the girls stood back and the guard pushed another control button.&nbsp; This caused the plate Dale was standing on to rotate slowly.&nbsp; The girls had now let go of him completely and he hung there with his arms pointed up to the ceiling affixed to the chain.&nbsp; The round plate he was standing on continued to turn, gradually speeding up.&nbsp; As centrifugal force was applied with increasing speed, Dale lost all semblance of balance and pitched forward in his uncomfortable position.&nbsp; He thought he would fall completely forward but he only fell as far as his restraints would allow him.&nbsp; A feeling of slight panic set in from the sensation of falling and he began to have trouble breathing through the inflatable gag he had been fitted with. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But almost as soon as it had started, the spinning stopped, and Dale was sufficiently disoriented.&nbsp; He could now be led in any direction without knowing which way they were taking him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To further disorient Dale, he would no longer be walking anywhere.&nbsp; One of the guards at the station brought forth a large motorized cart with a flat bed on it, measuring 1.5 by .5 meters.&nbsp; After unhooking Dale&#8217;s arm binder from the swivel chain, then unfastening his leg chain from the hook on the rotating plate, the girls shuffled Dale over to the cart and sat him down on it.&nbsp; They then laid him back and rolled him over onto his stomach.&nbsp; At this point, Dale could easily anticipate the position he would soon be in as Tonya pulled his feet up to his wrists. Melissa used the all-purpose restraint chain to connect them together, securing his hands and ankles only a few short links of chain apart.&nbsp; She then ran the small padlock through the necessary links on the chain to finalize the restrictive measure. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Dale was belly-down on a cart, with no way to count steps or to know which direction the team of young women was taking him.&nbsp; He could feel the motion of the cart as it moved down the hallways.&nbsp; He could sense, to some degree, when it was changing course, but the girls would spin the cart around in the middle of the floor to conceal the direction they were turning.&nbsp; In addition, Dale had no idea how fast it was moving.&nbsp; He had heard the sounds and felt the sensation of riding in an elevator at one point as well, with no idea how many floors he had moved, but he did sense they were moving downward.&nbsp; Not good if they were going underground, he surmised.&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, he could be down any number of hallways, in any number of directions, and on any number of levels in the complex.&nbsp; The ride on the cart lasted about ten minutes, he figured, but that&#8217;s about all he knew.&nbsp; The plan to disorient prisoners upon entry to the facility was completely successful, as Dale had no mental picture of where he was now. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale had wondered if he would meet other prisoners when he got to the facility, but so far had heard nothing.&nbsp; He heard no yelling or noise of any kind except the occasional chatter from the girls and the whine of the electric motor on the cart he was riding on.&nbsp; It was as if he was the only inmate in the entire place.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A large metal door was opened, Dale&#8217;s cart was pushed through it, and the door closed again with a loud heavy thud.&nbsp; With that Melissa and Tonya went to work removing some of the restraints Dale had been fitted with.&nbsp; First, Melissa removed the connecting chain, loosening the strict hogtie she had put Dale in.&nbsp; He was helped to stand up now, and Tonya spoke to him. 
�We are going to loosen most of your restraints, at least for awhile, but please do not try to resist.� She tugged on the leash, just enough to get Dale&#8217;s attention.&nbsp; �Do you understand?� she asked, rather politely.&nbsp; Dale nodded his leather-covered head and grunted into the inflatable bulb lodged in his mouth.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Alright, then� Tonya said as she began assisting Melissa, who had quickly unlocked the thumbcuffs Dale had been restrained with.&nbsp; Soon the girls were both unbuckling straps and unlacing the cruel single glove restraint Dale had been wearing now for hours.&nbsp; As it was removed, Dale could begin to feel life returning to his lower arms.&nbsp; He still wore the plastic zip-tie which kept his wrists bound together, but he still felt much less restricted than with the arm binder in place.&nbsp; His arms still hurt, but not as much.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonya then deflated the gag in Dale&#8217;s mouth, pulling it out and allowing him to rest his jaw.&nbsp; Dale drooled profusely as it was removed, unable to control it as his jaw and mouth were nearly numb from the strain the device had caused.&nbsp; Tonya followed up again with a rag, wiping Dale&#8217;s face and chin, then his chest, then her own chest; she had been standing rather close to him when she had removed the gag.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Will you check his hands, Melissa?� Tonya requested from her partner as she worked.&nbsp; �Make sure they&#8217;re not blue.�&nbsp; Melissa took Dale&#8217;s fingers and began to inspect them closely, rubbing them and kneading them in her hands. �I think he&#8217;s alright.� Melissa reported as she finished her inspection.&nbsp; For emphasis, she could not resist smacking Dale&#8217;s ass as she stood back up.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonya now unfastened Dale&#8217;s blindfold, allowing him to see for the first time since he entered the building.&nbsp; The light in the room was not particularly bright, but it hurt his eyes a little as he had become accustomed to pitch black.&nbsp; He saw Tonya in front of him and knew that Melissa was behind him, as she was now holding his zip-tied hands in hers.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The room had a low ceiling, maybe a little more than 2 meters, and appeared to be made of concrete.&nbsp; There were 4 heavy steel grills in the ceiling, 3 of which had lights behind them, and the other looked to be a small vent.&nbsp; A couple of metal devices hung from the ceiling.&nbsp; He looked down and saw a concrete floor with a small grate a few centimeters away from his feet.&nbsp; The room appeared to extend beyond Dale&#8217;s field of view, with an undetermined space beyond a nondescript concrete wall.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Tonya began to unstrap Dale&#8217;s hood.&nbsp; As she did so, Melissa withdrew her handcuffs from their place on her utility belt, ratcheting them onto Dale&#8217;s wrists above the zip-tie.&nbsp; Dale&#8217;s palms were still facing away from one another as Tonya had fixed them earlier in the zip tie and the arm binder.&nbsp; This allowed Melissa to cuff him properly without much trouble.&nbsp; Then she took out some diagonal cutters and cut off the zip tie.&nbsp; It had served its purpose, offering additional security while being thin enough to fit under the leather single glove restraint.&nbsp; Melissa double locked the hinged cuffs she had put on Dale and again stood behind him, using the restraints as a handle to hold him by.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Dale stood there in leg irons, hinged handcuffs, a thick leather collar, and the testicle leash.&nbsp; Actually, Dale felt relatively free considering the more strict restraints he had grown accustomed to over the past few hours.&nbsp; Tonya removed the leash from the adjustable locking ring that surrounded Dale&#8217;s scrotum, but left the ring on him.&nbsp; Apparently, this particular item was a full-time restraint not to be compromised for any reason.&nbsp; Tonya then removed the leather collar from his neck.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girls each took one of Dale&#8217;s elbows and ushered him toward the wall he was facing.&nbsp; When they had him standing in front of it less than a meter away, he could see that about halfway up the wall were small holes every few centimeters, and from these holes water poured out and down the face of the wall.&nbsp; Along the bottom of the wall was a trough filled with water.&nbsp; Tonya told him �if you need to go, now is the time�.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale did need to pee, but he knew he had never felt comfortable doing so with an audience.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �I can&#8217;t do it with you watching me� Dale told Tonya in a subdued voice, careful not to try to sound belligerent.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; � You will need to get used to being watched from now on, especially if you are outside your quarters as you are now� she said to him matter-of-factly.&nbsp; Smacking his ass cheek with one hand, Tonya gestured toward the water wall.&nbsp; Melissa held the hinges on Dales cuffed hands firmly as Dale renewed his efforts to concentrate on relieving himself.&nbsp; Finally, he was able to produce a squirt or two, followed by a more meaningful flow.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he finished, the two young women escorted Dale a few steps back from the water wall to stand directly under a shower head protruding from the concrete ceiling.&nbsp; From the floor an eye hook emerged, and Melissa dutifully wrapped a connecting chain between it and Dale&#8217;s leg chain, again padlocking the chain in place.&nbsp; When she finished, she pulled a small metal door down from the ceiling which concealed an overhead pull-down restraint chain.&nbsp; She took this chain and ran it through Dale&#8217;s handcuffs.&nbsp; Dale knew what was coming next as Tonya guided him to bend forward, pulling his arms up behind him in the process.&nbsp; When he was sufficiently bent over, Melissa applied another padlock to this chain.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale knew that soon he would be getting wet, and prepared himself.&nbsp; The girls left Dale hanging and stepped back near the doorway of the bathing cell.&nbsp; The door opened with a clanging noise and another woman entered.&nbsp; This woman was in her early to mid 30&#8217;s, and was scantily-clad in little more than a gray shirt that came down just below her waist.&nbsp; Below the shirt she wore a gray colored thong which was little more than strings on the sides and back.&nbsp; Dale immediately noticed that she wore a head harness securing a large red rubber ball behind her teeth.&nbsp; She had on a pair of flip-flops and her wavy brown hair was pulled in a pony tail behind her.&nbsp; She wore no makeup, but was attractive nonetheless, with tiny wrinkles around the corners of her eyes which seemed accentuated by the fact that her mouth was pried open with the gag. On her ankles were shackles with a half-meter of chain between them.&nbsp; She wore no shackles on her hands that Dale could see. On her gray-colored shirt was a small pocket and a series of numbers, and what looked to be a bar code.&nbsp; Dale noticed that on the front of her shirt, directly below her chin, was a series of wet spots-&nbsp; drool caused from the ballgag she wore.&nbsp; She shuffled into the room, the sound of chains clanging along the floor between her feet.&nbsp; She carried a brush with long soft bristles on a wooden handle a little under one meter long.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She walked over to stand directly behind Dale and as she did so, Tonya turned to the wall beside her where a series of knobs were located.&nbsp; From the shower head, lukewarm water began to spray out.&nbsp; From a small tube in the ceiling next to the shower head, a foamy soap began to spew out directly onto Dale&#8217;s back between his shoulder blades.&nbsp; Dale felt as the female prisoner began to brush his body down with her brush.&nbsp; She made quick, short motions with the brush, applying a generous amount of pressure to the handle as she worked.&nbsp; Soon, his entire body had been covered with the foamy soap.&nbsp; He then felt the woman&#8217;s hands in his hair, massaging the soap into his scalp.&nbsp; Soon thereafter, Dale felt her soapy hands move down under his armpits, then between his legs, where she applied soap generously to his scrotum which presented itself as a neat package as it was still constrained by the locking steel ring. When she finished soaping his nuts, he could feel her reaching up further between his legs and applying soap to his penis, which by now had become quite rigid.&nbsp; She was on her knees behind him now, and he could see her clearly as he looked back between his legs.&nbsp; He could not tell what her demeanor was because her gag distorted her facial expressions.&nbsp; He wondered if she was enjoying the experience as much as he was.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonya and Melissa stood at the door watching the bathing in progress, and while neither of them said anything, they both began to feel their little thongs getting moist again.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonya turned the soap dispenser off, allowing the water to rinse Dale&#8217;s body of the lather.&nbsp; The female prisoner, rather unceremoniously, grabbed the hair on the back of Dale&#8217;s head, pulling his head under the water to be sure it was properly rinsed of the soap.&nbsp; As she did this, Dale could feel her body pressed up closely to his backside.&nbsp; She was getting soaked from the water as much as he was, but she did not seem to mind.&nbsp; She used her left hand to guide his soapy hair under the water, and he could feel her right hand slip between his legs and grab his balls again.&nbsp; This move was concealed from the two guards by the way Dale and the female prisoner were standing.&nbsp; The female prisoner squeezed Dale&#8217;s balls firmly, almost painfully, but for only a couple of seconds.&nbsp; As she let go, he then felt her hand grab a big handful of his ass cheek.&nbsp; Then she let go and stepped away from Dale, laying the soapy brush down on the floor in front of her.&nbsp; Through his legs, he could see the woman shuffle over to the corner, turn and face the wall, then she got down to her knees and put her hands behind her head and waited.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonya turned the knob to stop the water, then she and Melissa both walked over toward the two prisoners.&nbsp; Dale was not going anywhere for now, so Tonya turned her attention to the female prisoner.&nbsp; Using a key to unlock a stainless-steel cabinet door, Tonya pulled from it a length of chain with handcuffs attached to it.&nbsp; Tonya stood the female prisoner up from her knees, wrapped the chain around her waist and secured it with a small lock near the small of her back.&nbsp; Dale could see what was going on, albeit from an awkward upside-down position.&nbsp; The female prisoner was still holding her hands behind her head, which caused her back to arch and her thong-clad ass to stick out a bit.&nbsp; Once Tonya got the chain locked onto her waist, she then reached between the woman&#8217;s legs and pulled a second, connected length of chain up between her buttocks.&nbsp; At the end of this chain was attached a pair of standard handcuffs, connected at the 2 small links between the manacles. Tonya threaded this pair of handcuffs back under the waist chain at the small of the female prisoner&#8217;s back, and looped it over the top of the chain where she promptly secured her prisoner&#8217;s hands one at a time.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the trustee properly secured for transport back to her cell, Melissa took her by the arm and led her to the door of the shower cell.&nbsp; The door opened loudly once again and the female prisoner exited.&nbsp; Dale could hear voices outside the cell and assumed another guard was waiting to take charge of the female prisoner.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon the door to the cell was closed again.&nbsp; Dale was relieved that soon he would be released from his strenuous position.&nbsp; He looked over at his two captors and to his surprise, saw them taking off their shirts.&nbsp; They stood there in their tight bottoms and sports bras, and busily began removing their tactical belts, which they put in a locked compartment. Soon, the girls were removing their boots and within no time their pants were also gone.&nbsp; Dale just hung there, quite uncomfortably, but not paying attention to his dilemma in the least.&nbsp; After the nice view he had gotten of the female prisoner&#8217;s ass a few moments ago, not to mention the fact that she had rubbed his cock and balls down with soap, Dale was hard as a rock at this point.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonya and Melissa were soon down to their military-issue black thongs and bras, having removed everything else.&nbsp; They were busy pulling towels and other items down from one of several stainless doors that lined the walls in the shower cell.&nbsp; As he watched, Tonya and Melissa peeled off the bras, dropped their tiny thongs to the floor, picked up a few items and walked toward him, then past him.&nbsp; As Tonya went past, she smiled down at Dale and traced her hand across his back as she walked past. As she reached his ass with her hand, Dale expected the now-obligatory smack, but it didn&#8217;t come, almost to his disappointment. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale could see the girls walk to the far wall behind him.&nbsp; They immediately turned on hot water which began to steam around them.&nbsp; They were soon lathered up with soap, and each washed the other&#8217;s back with a sponge.&nbsp; As he watched the two girls frolicking and giggling in the shower, Dale&#8217;s cock was as hard as he could ever remember it being.&nbsp; Even though he was no stranger to seeing naked women, these girls were quite hot, and in very good shape. Their legs were especially shapely, resulting from years of military physical training, undoubtedly.&nbsp; Seeing them together in the shower, rubbing their toned nude bodies down with soap was driving him crazy.&nbsp; What made him even more crazy was the fact that these two sexy girls were totally in control of his every move, his every breath.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, they turned off the water and reached for large white towels they had hung nearby. Melissa, after drying herself off, appeared to use some type of deodorant, then pulled the towel up around her wet hair.&nbsp; Tonya soon followed suit, and soon Dale got a nice view of both girls almost simultaneously pulling fresh clean black thongs up over their hips, bending down slightly as they did so.&nbsp; With a bit of wiggling, the little triangles of these skimpy thongs nestled neatly into their proper curves and crannies.&nbsp; Then came matching black sports bras covering the small but shapely breasts of both girls.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girls had taken flip-flops with them into the shower and now stepped into them.&nbsp; Apparently, they had no immediate plans to don uniforms.&nbsp; They seemed perfectly at ease walking around in their skimpy underwear and flip-flops.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They walked back over to the compartments and stowed their toiletries and soiled laundry, then took their tactical belts from the locked compartment and put them around their waists.&nbsp; These belts contained most of the restraints and keys and weapons and other various items, and even though the girls had decided to make themselves comfortable for their upcoming time off, they still had business to attend to with Dale.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonya, looking like something out of a comic book in her skimpy attire with full tactical gear, walked over to Dale and soon began to unlock the overhead chain from his handcuffs.&nbsp; Dale groaned a bit as he was finally able to stand up and blood began to rush back into his upper extremities.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His feet were still secured fast to the floor with yet another connecting chain, but Melissa was soon unlocking that as well.&nbsp; Soon Dale stood upright, still handcuffed and shackled at the ankles.&nbsp; He could still feel the stainless locking ring on his scrotum, but it didn&#8217;t really hurt much.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonya and Melissa took Dale by each elbow and led him around the edge of the wall that he had not previously been able to see around. On the far end of this area was a set of steel lockers inset into the concrete.&nbsp; As they approached with the shuffling Dale between them, Tonya left Dale in Melissa&#8217;s custody temporarily to unlock some of the compartments.&nbsp; As she opened these, Dale could see they contained all types of restraints, chains, and what appeared to be leather items such as the one Dale&#8217;s arms had been restrained in earlier. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a nod, Tonya motioned to Melissa, who lightly kneed the back of Dale&#8217;s legs. Dale knew this meant for him to hit his knees, and he did so right in front of a flat metal bench that was bolted to the floor.&nbsp; Soon Dale was bent forward over the bench.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonya handed Melissa a chain leash, which Melissa padlocked immediately to the steel ring binding Dale&#8217;s scrotum.&nbsp; She looped the handle end of the leash through a hook on her tactical belt.&nbsp; While Melissa kept tension on the leash, Tonya looked down at Dale.&nbsp; She held a tazer in her hand, making sure to get it close enough to Dale&#8217;s face that he could see it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Do not even think about trying anything while we remove your handcuffs.&nbsp; If you do, you&#8217;ll never make it to this door, much less any of the other locked doors beyond.&nbsp; Understand?�&nbsp; she stated.&nbsp; Dale shook his head in acknowledgement.&nbsp; With that, Tonya unlocked the hinged cuffs from Dale&#8217;s wrists.&nbsp; She then stood by, tazer in hand while Melissa rolled Dale over onto his back, laying him down on the bench.&nbsp; Taking the handcuffs from Tonya, Melissa re-applied them to Dale&#8217;s wrists back up under the long bench.&nbsp; So much for getting relief from having his hands pulled behind him, he thought.&nbsp; She then sat down on Dale&#8217;s knees, taking a length of chain from Tonya and wrapping it around Dale&#8217;s already-shackled ankles, securing them to the bench.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Tonya took a few large wide leather straps from one of the compartments and approached Dale with them.&nbsp; She wrapped the first one around Dale&#8217;s waist and the bench.&nbsp; Then another one around his upper knees.&nbsp; She then turned around and put a large one around his torso and arms, which were already under the bench- now they were just more firmly in place there.&nbsp; The last strap Tonya applied around Dale&#8217;s neck.&nbsp;&nbsp; As she did this, Melissa revisited all of the other straps and secured them an extra notch.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale now felt as if he was part of the bench.&nbsp; Any pride or modesty he had about his erect member had vanished at this point, as it was standing lewdly at full attention and there was nothing he could do to conceal it, especially now that his beautiful captors were nearly nude with their gorgeous bodies so close to him.&nbsp; Even though Dale had grown up without ever knowing a lack of female companionship, he found the situation he was in quite erotic to say the least.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girls stood up, their task completed.&nbsp; Melissa asked Tonya �Did you bring it?�&nbsp; Tonya smiled at her and walked back over to their locker area, pulling something from a duffel bag.&nbsp; She walked back over to where Dale was strapped down to the bench and held up the item in question.&nbsp; It was some type of harness with a rubber penis attached.&nbsp; The girls looked down at Dale, who was busy looking up at them.&nbsp; Tonya then knelt down near Dale&#8217;s head and began to strap the thing to his face.&nbsp; She told him to open his mouth wide and as he did, she inserted a large ball mounted on the backside of the phallus.&nbsp; Now the rubber cock stood straight out from his face about 6-7 inches or so.&nbsp; Tonya proceeded to buckle several straps behind Dale&#8217;s head and under his chin, ensuring the device would not slip off.&nbsp; He knew what it was for, he had just never seen one designed to fit on somebody&#8217;s head�at least not in person.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melissa had already removed her tactical belt and was sitting on Dale by the time Tonya had finished applying the dildo-gag.&nbsp; She began by straddling his knees and facing his raging hard-on, then bent forward to get a better view.&nbsp; She grabbed the chain leash attached to his balls and pulled it taught, not so much it would hurt but enough to take the slack out of the chain, pulling his unit a tad closer to her.&nbsp; She brought forth a small package, tore it open, and then rolled a condom down the length of Dale&#8217;s penis.&nbsp; Then she proceeded to breathe warm air onto the head, not quite touching it yet.&nbsp; Then she stuck out her tongue and began to lick the shaft up and down slowly.&nbsp; Dale could not see her down there as by this time, Tonya had dropped her own tactical belt and was sitting on his chest, looking down at him, blocking his view of anything going on behind her.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale began to moan with pleasure every time Melissa licked his cock, and as he looked up at Tonya, he could see that her pupils had dilated to the point that he could not even tell what color her irises were.&nbsp; She began to rub the area covered by the little black triangle of cloth she wore.&nbsp; Then, with a sigh and a slight grunt, she stood up, turned around facing away from him, and mounted the cock attached to his face, pushing her thong to the side to allow the object to slide deep into her.&nbsp; She pushed herself down as far as she could go, and Dale could see her ass cheeks coming down to rest directly onto his brow and the sides of his face.&nbsp; Dale could smell Tonya&#8217;s perfumed scent as she put it on him, and it made him even more aroused than he had already been.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon Dale could feel Melissa mounting him.&nbsp; The girls were now both slowly moving themselves up and down on Dale&#8217;s real and artificial phalluses.&nbsp; He could hear the sound of lips and tongues smacking as Tonya and Melissa kissed one another with wet, sloppy abandon.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, Dale could hear Tonya moaning louder and her body was moving up and down on his face more rapidly.&nbsp; Melissa&#8217;s pace also picked up and soon the girls&#8217; bodies were slamming down hard onto Dale.&nbsp; Melissa&#8217;s cunt felt good and he felt himself coming close to a massive orgasm, despite his testicles being restrained with the steel ring. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonya screamed out, and as she did so, her thighs tightened around Dale&#8217;s face which began to get wet as she came in wave after wave of ecstasy.&nbsp; Soon Dale thought he might drown as a result of Tonya&#8217;s squirting, but eventually, after making Dale think he would either drown or get his head squeezed off, she stopped.&nbsp; Despite the moist situation, his cock was at the brink and when he felt Melissa&#8217;s legs clench around his hips, he knew she was coming and the thought of it was enough to bring him to an intense orgasm of his own.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With his body constrained in every way imaginable, Dale felt a huge release through his cock like he had never felt before.&nbsp; It was about the only thing on his body that wasn&#8217;t strapped down or held in place with a woman&#8217;s thighs at the moment.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, Tonya was giggling and still breathing heavily.&nbsp; She was still seated firmly with her ass pressed against Dale&#8217;s face.&nbsp; Dale could barely see anything but Tonya&#8217;s backside.&nbsp; His eyebrows and the tops of his cheeks were gleaming with Tonya&#8217;s fluids, and he found it a little difficult to get a good breath as his mouth was filled with a large black rubber ball, in addition to Tonya&#8217;s weight pushing down on him.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the trio each attempted to catch his or her breath, the door to the cell opened loudly and Corporal Abrams entered, catching the two girls in the act of raping the prisoner.&nbsp; Dale could feel the girls tense up, and although he could not see who had entered, he had heard bootsteps and knew it must be one of the girls&#8217; superiors. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girls stood up immediately, adjusted their pushed-aside thongs to cover their most private areas once again, and stood side by side at attention beside the helpless Dale, who at this point was wearing only a well-used condom, a dildo-harness gag, and of course the myriad of restraints that held him firmly to the bench.&nbsp; There was no way they could deny what the corporal had walked in on.&nbsp; 




End of Chapter 3&nbsp; 










Postapocalypto 4 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonya and Melissa stood at full attention as Corporal Abrams walked further into the restraint area, inspecting the situation before her.&nbsp; The prisoner was firmly secured to the metal bench, she noticed.&nbsp; Security had obviously not been compromised.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale was quite a mess, with Tonya&#8217;s secretions still all over his face and the dildo gag firmly affixed to his head and face.&nbsp; His own cock was also well-lubed with Melissa&#8217;s juices, and the condom hung loosely on his softening cock.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abrams said in a low voice �You girls need to be more discreet. Had the sergeant seen this episode, we might be incarcerating the two of you today.&nbsp; Now, I know I sent in a trustee to give him a bath earlier, but it appears he will need another one, and I won&#8217;t be sending anybody this time, so you&#8217;ll have to scrub him yourself.&nbsp; And get him good and clean because he is due in 20 minutes for an orientation meeting with myself, the sergeant and the base commander.&nbsp; Oh, and in addition to standard restraints, did you two get the memo yesterday about the use of a full-time scrotum restraint on male prisoners at this facility from now on?�&nbsp; The girls nodded.&nbsp; Tonya acknowledged by informing the corporal that the restraint was currently in use, pointing at Dale&#8217;s cock as she spoke.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With an affirmative nod, Bridgette turned on her heel and walked to the door, tapping on it to signal the guard outside.&nbsp; The guard checked the camera and buzzed the door open, then closed it behind her.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girls quickly got to work busily unfastening the straps securing Dale. Melissa unfastened the lock on the chain holding his feet to the metal bench.&nbsp; Although the chain was removed, his feet were still shackled together as they had been since his capture.&nbsp; Once again, Tonya stood guard with a tazer gun, pressing it flush to his skin between his shoulder blades as Melissa quickly unlocked Dale&#8217;s handcuffs from under the bench.&nbsp; She helped Dale to sit up and very quickly re-attached his hands behind his back, before he could act on any possible ideas.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonya holstered the tazer and went to work unfastening the dildo gag from Dale&#8217;s head.&nbsp; She and Melissa were silent as they went about their tasks, both feeling a bit embarrassed about the corporal catching them having their way with a prisoner.&nbsp; Both doubted, however, that anything would come of it.&nbsp; Corporal Abrams was typically easy-going, unlike the Sergeant.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melissa took the leash attached to Dale&#8217;s scrotum ring and instructed him to stand up.&nbsp; He did so, and she led him back over to the shower area.&nbsp; Soon, he was reattached by his handcuffs to a chain dropped from the ceiling, bent forward with his leg irons secured to the hook in the floor rendering him stationary for his next shower.&nbsp; Tonya turned on the water and Melissa began to scrub him down with soap.&nbsp; Tonya joined them and both girls proceeded to lather Dale up.&nbsp; The girls both worked quickly but managed to take time to pay special attention to Dale&#8217;s cock.&nbsp; Tonya then moved on to Dale&#8217;s poor creamed-upon face and smiled at him as she worked, although neither girl said much.&nbsp; After rinsing the soap from Dale&#8217;s body, the girls left him chained up and went to once again take a shower of their own.&nbsp; Dale stood, precariously bent forward, noticing a bit of a chill blowing on his wet body.&nbsp; The girls were more businesslike while bathing this time, and soon were putting on yet another round of thongs and bras. They soon donned their tight fatigues and short jackets, and shortly thereafter were buckling their duty belts.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they finished dressing they walked back over to Dale.&nbsp; Tonya unattached his cuffed wrists from the overhead chain which held him in a stringent strapedo position.&nbsp; Melissa stooped down to unfasten the connector chain from the hook in the floor.&nbsp; Now Dale was at least able to stand upright, although he was still quite secure in his hinged handcuffs, leg irons, and scrotum restraint.&nbsp; The chain leash was still attached to the eye ring welded to the device, and it hung down to the floor until Melissa took it into her hand.&nbsp; When she had Dale and his cock under her firm guidance, she led him back over to the equipment lockers and had him sit on the metal bench where the girls had raped him earlier.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �What do you think, Tonya?� asked Melissa as the trio approached the cabinets.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Well, for sure a blindfold.&nbsp; That&#8217;s mandatory for the hallways.�&nbsp; Tonya stated as she assessed Dale&#8217;s state of restriction.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Oh, I know, but what about a gag?&nbsp; They&#8217;ll be asking him questions�will he need it?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Well, it can&#8217;t hurt.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve never been reprimanded for overdoing it, have we?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �You have a point- a gag it is.&nbsp; Here, I&#8217;ll let you choose which one while I get this blindfold on him.�&nbsp; With that, Melissa walked behind Dale with a hood that she began to fit over his head.&nbsp; It was made of a rubbery material and stretched to snap together down the backside.&nbsp; It completely covered the eyes and most of the nose, but left the mouth, nostrils, and ears open.&nbsp; It was not the high-security hood he had worn earlier, but it was quite effective in blocking his sight and he would not get it off without the use of his hands.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonya was looking through the locker and selected a black ball gag for her prisoner to wear into the meeting with the base commander.&nbsp; It had a strap that buckled behind Dale&#8217;s head, and a secondary, smaller strap that went under the chin to keep it from being spat out.&nbsp; Like the hood, it was far from the highest security model she had to choose from, but for the short term it would be fine and would be easily-removed when the interrogation began.&nbsp; Soon Tonya was fitting the ball into Dale&#8217;s mouth and within a few seconds the buckles were being tightened, followed by a small lock on the back buckle provided by Melissa.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now totally blinded, gagged, and as had become normal- helpless, Dale stood until the young women began to usher him back toward the main door.&nbsp; Melissa gently tugged on the leash while Tonya walked behind him, holding his shoulders and gently guiding him.&nbsp; The guard was summoned and the door was electronically unlocked from the hallway, making a slight buzzing sound as Dale was led through.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the door closed behind the group, Dale could hear the cart again.&nbsp; Melissa and Tonya held Dale in place while the guard in the hallway maneuvered the cart right up to Dale&#8217;s shins.&nbsp; Soon Dale found himself being lifted under the arms by the girls, who laid him down face-first onto the flat cold metal cargo surface.&nbsp; In short order, Melissa pulled Dale&#8217;s fettered feet up behind him, then sat down on them to flatten them down a bit.&nbsp; Rather than use a connecting chain as she had earlier, Melissa used a pair of standard hinged handcuffs to attach Dales feet to his wrists, allowing him little if any movement.&nbsp; Dale had virtually no slack between his wrists and his ankles now.&nbsp; His shoulders were forced back a bit to accommodate the uncomfortable position, but he didn&#8217;t figure to be on the cart long, as he had heard the corporal use the 20 minute figure earlier, and that had been over 15 minutes ago by his estimation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group moved quickly throughout the hallways and shortly arrived at a door.&nbsp; Tonya pressed a call button and announced their presence.&nbsp; Soon the girls and their charge were being buzzed in.&nbsp; Melissa removed Dale from his short-term hog tie, and the girls pulled him up to stand.&nbsp; Dale could hear female voices talking in hushed tones a few feet away, but had no idea how many were in the room.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonya and Melissa took Dale once again under his arms and led him over to a chair, but not just any chair.&nbsp; This one was specifically-designed with accommodations for prisoners, with lots of open holes and heavy metal construction.&nbsp; Since Dale was already heavily restrained, the girls sat him down as he was into the chair.&nbsp;&nbsp; He found himself sitting back on his cuffed hands.&nbsp; The girls were not finished, however.&nbsp; Tonya ran a connecting chain between Dale&#8217;s wrists, through a hole in the chair back to a restraint hook on the frame of the chair only a few centimeters from the hole.&nbsp; This allowed Dale virtually no hand movement and secured him definitively to the metal chair.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Melissa ran another connecting chain from his ankle chain to another restraint hook near his feet.&nbsp; This was also pulled tight with virtually no slack.&nbsp; Now Dale was firmly attached to the chair at two points.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonya unbuckled the ball gag from behind his head and pulled it off, taking strings of drool with it, some which landed on Dale&#8217;s chest.&nbsp; While Tonya attended to the gag, Melissa looked to Sergeant Tompkins and asked if her commanders would like the hood removed.&nbsp; Apparently the answer was in the affirmative, as Dale soon felt the hood being unsnapped.&nbsp; After taking a few seconds for his eyes to adjust to the moderately-bright light, Dale could see that his chair was positioned in front of a long table with 2 women sitting behind it, both wearing military-type uniforms.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sergeant Tompkins spoke first.&nbsp; �Sir, you have been captured in the act of violations of the global non-communications laws governing independent colonies residing inside the boundaries of recognized countries of the Unified Nations.&nbsp; What this means for you is that your freedom has been completely forfeited by you, and you are at the mercy of the state at this point.&nbsp; Understand, this is not a trial.&nbsp; Your very presence in a non-com zone is grounds for your permanent detention, as it has been made abundantly clear to all those residing in the colonies that these areas are strictly off-limits.&nbsp; The reason you are in this room now is that it has been mandated that all detainees be informed of their situation on the first day of custody.&nbsp; While your guilt is not open to debate, we do have questions for you that you will be required to answer.&nbsp; Forthright answers will be rewarded with special privileges, and resistance to the interrogations will be met with harsh punishment.&nbsp; Do you understand what I have told you?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale did not respond to the question.&nbsp; Instead, he kept his head down, not making eye contact with the two women at the table.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Do you understand?� repeated Sergeant Tompkins.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, Dale remained silent.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �I can see where this is going.&nbsp; From this point on, you will be asked questions requiring a yes/no answer.&nbsp; At some point during the next 24 hours, the gag will begin to hurt your jaw considerably.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that statement, the sergeant nodded to Tonya, who promptly pulled Dales head back by his hair, simultaneously pressing the rubber ball to his lips.&nbsp; Dale kept his mouth closed, but Melissa soon joined Tonya, pinching Dale&#8217;s nostrils shut.&nbsp; Corporal Abrams, which Dale did not even realize was in the room behind him, withdrew her tazer gun from her belt.&nbsp; She pressed the electrodes against Dale&#8217;s inner thigh and pressed the trigger.&nbsp; Dale&#8217;s mouth opened up in a scream, soon being filled by Tonya&#8217;s black rubber ball gag.&nbsp; Soon it was strapped into place, and the girls let go of the writhing prisoner who sat in shock, squirming in the metal chair.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As if nothing had just occurred, the sergeant continued speaking to Dale.&nbsp; The other woman at the table just looked on with a certain sense of professionalism, not allowing the commotion to stir her.&nbsp; She scratched her forehead and perused some of the paperwork in front of her as the sergeant spoke.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Mark it down, please, Corporal: 24 hours gagged.&nbsp; Perhaps he will learn to answer questions at some point.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Yes, Ma&#8217;am� Corporal Abrams responded, as she wrote the order down on a clipboard.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �You could avoid such situations by cooperating.&nbsp; You will be formally interrogated at some point, but for now our specialists are at another facility, so it will be a few days.&nbsp; In the meantime, you are to remain in custody at this facility until time that your sentence is determined by a state judge.&nbsp; Midwest Correctional Solutions, the company that runs this facility and employs myself as well as the rest of the staff here, is not in control of your sentencing, only your incarceration.&nbsp; And as you may notice we take great pride in our work.&nbsp; As a result, escape is an unrealistic sentiment, as is resistance.&nbsp; Do what you&#8217;re told, and you will be treated with basic human dignity, fed, and sheltered.&nbsp; Fight us, and you will regret it with all your being.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Commander, would you care to add anything?� the sergeant looked at Commander Donna Hightower.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commander Hightower looked up from her paperwork momentarily and quickly introduced herself to Dale.&nbsp; She made no threatening comments and acted with professionalism, but asked him no questions.&nbsp; She basically reiterated what the sergeant had said regarding the fact that MCS was only charged with his incarceration, not his formal punishment.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She then followed up with the sergeant �I understand that your party also captured an ATV and some gear?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Yes, commander.&nbsp; We have taken it to the shop to have it totally checked over for intelligence.&nbsp; We also GPS marked the area of capture in case nothing is found on the vehicle, although we do not believe he had time to toss anything.&nbsp; He was captured within a few meters of where he was first made aware of our presence..�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Very well, then.&nbsp; Keep me informed on this. If we do not find anything, it will mean he was carrying a simple message to be extracted by the interrogation team.&nbsp; By the way, when are they due back?�
&nbsp;&nbsp; �They are scheduled to be gone until next week, Ma&#8217;am� replied the sergeant. �Probably next Wednesday.&nbsp; They caught that group up in the northeastern provinces, and are working overtime to debrief the lot of them�.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �I see.&nbsp; Well, this meeting is over.&nbsp; We have informed the new prisoner of his situation, and I believe he may need awhile to get accustomed to his new surroundings.&nbsp; Corporal, please take our new guest away to his cell.&nbsp; I would imagine he is ready for some lunch- it&#8217;s too late for breakfast.&nbsp; Now that I think of it, I missed breakfast as well.&nbsp; Sergeant, shall we go grab a bite?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Yes, Ma&#8217;am� replied the sergeant.&nbsp; With that, the two women stood up, pushed in their chairs, and walked around the side of the table.&nbsp; As they approached the door, it was opened and they walked out into the hallway.&nbsp; Dale noticed the commander as she walked out.&nbsp; Like most of the other women he had seen so far, she was very fit and although older than the rest of the females, was probably not more than early 40&#8217;s.&nbsp; She had dark red hair bundled up into a ponytail and walked with authoritative speed and posture, helped in great part by her tall leather boots that came well up her calves, ending about 4 inches below her knees.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were now 3 females in the room with Dale.&nbsp; As soon as the sergeant and Commander Hightower were gone, Corporal Abrams walked around to face Dale.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �From now on, when any of our officers asks you a question, you answer her, especially when it is the base commander or the sergeant.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t be a fool, and you won&#8217;t have to live in the kind of pain you&#8217;re experiencing now�.&nbsp; As she spoke, she nodded toward Dale&#8217;s shaking hand, still under the influence of the tazer shock.&nbsp; �Alright ladies, let&#8217;s get him to his new home�.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melissa was already pulling the hood back over Dale&#8217;s head as Tonya checked the tightness of the ball gag, which had been applied hastily a few moments earlier.&nbsp; Then the connecting chains which attached Dale to the chair were unlocked, allowing the girls to stand him up on his feet which were a bit shaky to say the least.&nbsp; The effects of the tazer would take awhile to wear off.&nbsp; Dale could still feel the pain throughout his body, particularly his extremities.&nbsp; His teeth even hurt from the shock, and he was even less able than before to control his lips around the edges of the rubber ball in his mouth, so he was already drooling profusely.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The corporal wheeled the cart over to Dale, and once again he soon found himself face-down on its cold steel surface, hog-cuffed behind his back.&nbsp; Dale could hear the door to the room opening and felt the sensation of being wheeled out into the corridor.&nbsp; He heard the corporal tell the girls �CC-12� and assumed that was the number to his cell.&nbsp; So did that mean there were more than 26 detention levels in this facility, if they ran out of single alphabetical designations?&nbsp; He pondered this as he was wheeled closer to his new home.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few minutes, the cart stopped and Dale could hear a metal door opening.&nbsp; Then he felt himself moving a few more feet and stopping again.&nbsp; 
He felt Melissa remove the set of cuffs from between his handcuffs and leg irons, then felt his legs being unfurled.&nbsp; The girls each took him by an elbow and hefted his semi-limp body up off the cart, onto his feet.&nbsp; He stood a bit shakily but the girls held him to keep him from falling over.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Well, you&#8217;ve managed to make your first day here uncomfortable, Mister� Tonya said in a low tone of voice.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ve got to keep you gagged the rest of today, tonight, and all the way until eleven-hundred hours tomorrow.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll be lucky if you&#8217;ll be able to move your jaw when it&#8217;s all over with�.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Yeah, and we&#8217;ve got to keep him handcuffed so he won&#8217;t be able to get the gag off,� Melissa added as she removed the shackles from Dale&#8217;s feet.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Yeah, you&#8217;re right, I&#8217;m afraid.&nbsp; Look, we really don&#8217;t want to make things any more difficult for you than they already are, but your unwillingness to cooperate with the sergeant back there forces our hand, you see�.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale felt drool landing on his chest as he stood between the girls and listened to their admonitions.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t really feel good about leaving him alone with a ballgag, Tonya�, stated Melissa.&nbsp; �We don&#8217;t need him choking in his sleep�.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Well, the sergeant said we had to keep him in a gag, but she didn&#8217;t specify what type.&nbsp; I&#8217;m thinking maybe a ring gag would be best for this job.&nbsp; What do you think?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �I believe that&#8217;s a good idea. I&#8217;m thinking a full head harness, too..I&#8217;ll need to go get it, so let&#8217;s get him stationary so you can guard him by yourself.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Alright�, Tonya answered.&nbsp; Soon the girls had Dale&#8217;s handcuffed wrists attached via connecting chain to a metal ring counter-set into the wall.&nbsp; The location of the ring was about a foot above where Dale&#8217;s wrists hung naturally, so he was slightly bent forward, as the connecting chain was pulled tight with little slack, then wrapped several times like a rope before being padlocked by Melissa.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Should we leave his legs free for now?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t see any reason to secure them unless he gives us one�, replied Tonya, who emphasized the point with a firm slap on Dale&#8217;s ass.&nbsp; The slap startled Dale, who was not expecting it, and a fresh stream of drool popped out from behind the rubber ball gag, landing on his foot.&nbsp; With that, Tonya took the scrotum leash in her hand, wrapped it around Dale&#8217;s hinged-together wrists a couple of times next to the connecting chain, pulling it mildly taut to emphasize to Dale his situation, then she sat down on a bunk a few feet from him.&nbsp; She reached up and turned on a reading light embedded in the wall above the pillow, and motioned for Melissa to retrieve the necessary restraint hardware from the equipment room.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as Melissa had left, Tonya got up from the bunk, walked over to Dale and grabbed his balls in her hand.&nbsp; �I hope you will cooperate next time, really�I do not want to have to hurt you again like we did awhile ago.&nbsp; I am sorry the corporal had to taze you earlier.&nbsp; I do not like seeing that.&nbsp; Just do what you&#8217;re told, will you?�&nbsp; Without waiting for a reply from Dale, Tonya continued �My name is Tonya.&nbsp; After today, you will not see me as often, as we are often out on patrol, but I will be back every few days or so.&nbsp; I cannot protect you except to tell you that you will be taken care of if you do what you&#8217;re asked.&nbsp; But understand, there are people here that will not think twice about really hurting you.&nbsp; Please abide by all the rules, even if you do not like them.&nbsp; Do not give them a reason to hurt you.&nbsp; Do you hear what I am trying to tell you?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale nodded his head in the affirmative, showing more respect for this young girl than he had her superiors earlier.&nbsp; He knew that if he had any friends now at all, she was it.&nbsp; Tonya responded to him by patting him on the side of the face a couple of times, then she went back to sit on the bunk.&nbsp; Her body was tired from being out on patrol for 3 days.&nbsp; She longed for the solitude and rest her quarters would provide for her soon.&nbsp; She was even more exhausted from her first real sexual experience with Dale&#8217;s face earlier.&nbsp; She looked at him hanging from the wall by his tightly-cuffed wrists and pitied him somewhat, but knew it was her job to keep him here in this place until it was decided what would be done with him on a permanent basis.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melissa returned shortly thereafter with a ring gag on a head harness.&nbsp; As she walked in, Tonya got up and began to undo Dale&#8217;s connecting chain from the ring in the wall.&nbsp; Soon Dale was standing upright once again.&nbsp; Melissa soon had the hood and the ball gag removed, but before Dale could enjoy the freedom of his jaw, she was replacing these restraints with the head harness and ring gag, which he reluctantly allowed her to insert behind his teeth.&nbsp; He offered Melissa no resistance mostly because of what Tonya had told him, but also because he didn&#8217;t want a repeat performance of the tazer.&nbsp; Tonya looked into Dale&#8217;s eyes but said nothing as she helped Melissa fit the harness, tightening the under-chin strap as Melissa minded the ones at the back.&nbsp; Melissa then produced a small lock to finalize the security of the harness.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the girls turned their attention to Dale&#8217;s other restraints.&nbsp; Melissa suggested they hog tie him once more but Tonya lobbied for something more comfortable, stating it was in his best interest to get some rest and it would be impossible to rest if restrained that way.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was agreed that Dale would be fitted with a belly chain, then a connecting chain would be attached to Dale&#8217;s scrotum ring, run up his ass crack, over the belly chain in back, and attached to a pair of non-hinged standard handcuffs that Tonya produced.&nbsp; This would prevent Dale from working the cuffs around to his front where he would be more able to interfere with his gag.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonya took time to demonstrate the differences in the chain cuffs and the hinged cuffs to Dale as she swapped them out, first placing the chain cuffs on his wrists before removing the hinged ones.&nbsp; They would allow him a little more wiggle room, but not very much, as there were only 2 links between the bracelets, but at least Dale now had some ability to swivel each wrist.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the girls finished their work on his restraints, Dale began to drool most profusely, even more than with the ball gag before.&nbsp; The ring gag was impossible to form any type of seal around to keep saliva from falling out.&nbsp; When Melissa or Tonya would bend him down for any reason, drool would automatically fall down his chin.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once cuffed up, the girls sat Dale down on his bunk.&nbsp; He soon felt the limits of his connector chain from his wrists to his scrotum ring, but he was able to lay back and roll over somewhat with Tonya&#8217;s help.&nbsp; The bed was soft and comfortable compared to where he had been sleeping in the wilderness for the past few weeks.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �If you don&#8217;t try to move around too much, you should be ok.&nbsp; You can get to the toilet if need be, but don&#8217;t let the guards catch you doing anything you&#8217;ll regret�, Tonya warned as she backed up a few steps to survey her work.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, Melissa produced a chain which she wrapped around Dale&#8217;s left ankle and locked on just tightly enough that it would not come off.&nbsp; She looped the other end around another recessed ring in the wall, this one near the foot of the bunk.&nbsp; There was enough slack in this chain so that Dale could just get to the toilet if he needed to, but that was not much since the toilet was basically right in front of the bunk.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale did not know how he would manage going to the bathroom in the restrained situation he found himself in.&nbsp; He started to wish he had given the sergeant a little more cooperation earlier.&nbsp; Perhaps then he would not have to sleep chained up like an animal.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonya and Melissa checked and rechecked Dale&#8217;s restraints, then both girls stood at the heavy steel door, identified themselves via intercom to the hall jailer who checked the video monitor and buzzed the door open.&nbsp; The girls walked out and the door clanged shut heavily behind them.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24 hours, Dale thought as he laid on his side to keep the handcuffs from digging into his backside.&nbsp; He did his best to keep his mouth toward the ceiling so he would not drool in his bed.&nbsp; The ring in his mouth was large and kept it open wide.&nbsp; As soon as the girls left him to himself, he spent several frantic minutes attempting to push the ring out with his tongue, which did not work. Even though he could open his mouth wide enough to get it from behind his teeth momentarily, the ring was strapped in his mouth tightly enough to keep him from popping it out.&nbsp; As he continually failed to push the ring out, he finally succumbed to the idea that he was stuck with it.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had spent enough time in handcuffs by this time to know that without something to pick the locks with, there was simply no use trying to escape from them.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So he struggled to get to his knees on the cot, then looked around the dimly-lit cell as much as his eyes would allow for anything he could pick the locks with.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any small piece of metal might work if he could lodge it successfully under the teeth of the rotating half of the cuffs and pry that half backward from the ratchet mechanism.&nbsp; Unfortunately for Dale, the facility he was in was quite sterile in nature and he saw absolutely nothing he could use as a shim. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Dale looked down to the floor, he momentarily forgot about his ring gag and drool poured out of his mouth, down his chin.&nbsp; As it happened, Dale quickly leaned forward so most of it landed in the floor.&nbsp; Dale sighed and sat back against the wall, careful not to pull too tightly on the chain that connected his wrists to his balls.&nbsp; He realized how exhausted he was, having not slept in nearly two days.&nbsp; He rested his head back against the concrete wall and closed his eyes.&nbsp; For now, he would have to remain where he was.&nbsp; He would wait for the right opportunity to escape later, when and if his captors let their guard down.&nbsp; Fact is, he didn&#8217;t know anything about the information he was carrying on his ATV.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t even know the location of the intel aside from the fact that it was located somewhere on the bike itself.&nbsp; The colonists had very crafty ways of hiding vast quantities of information on microchips, then hiding the microchips in various locations on vehicles or equipment. Sometimes it would take government agents weeks or months to find it.&nbsp; Dale worried that they would not believe that he didn&#8217;t know where it was and that he would face severe treatment at the hands of his captors as Tonya had warned.&nbsp; Dale pondered this as he quickly dozed off.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The loud clunky noise of Dale&#8217;s cell door awoke him a while later, although he didn&#8217;t know how long he had been out.&nbsp; He found himself on his side, still restrained as Tonya and Melissa had left him.&nbsp; His mattress was soaked near where his face had been with drool and his arms hurt considerably, as did his jaw.&nbsp; The dim light of the bunk lamp was soon superceded by the bright light from the hallway as his cell door swung open widely.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale could see at least two figures in the doorway, one behind the other.&nbsp; As they entered his cell, he could see that the one closest to him was the female inmate that had given him a scrubbing in the shower earlier.&nbsp; She carried a tray in front of her and Dale could smell food.&nbsp; She still wore a prison-issue gray shirt and tiny grey cotton thong beneath, and wore thin flip-flops on her feet now.&nbsp; Aside from that, her hair was still pulled up behind her head in a ponytail.&nbsp; As she walked in, he noticed her feet were still chained together and she wore a belly chain with her hands apparently cuffed to the sides, which allowed her to hold the metal tray.&nbsp; She wore a ball gag in her mouth as before, and kept her head down for the most part.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The person behind her was a guard, and she wore the same uniform that Tonya and Melissa had worn.&nbsp; Tight grey-colored fatigue bottoms, combat-style boots, and a tight black top with a few buttons near the neckline, all buttoned up.&nbsp; This woman appeared to be in her late 20&#8217;s or early 30&#8217;s, but it was hard to tell in the light.&nbsp; Dale did notice that her hair was pulled back and had a wet appearance, appearing light in color.&nbsp; It was not as long as the younger girls&#8217; hair, coming down to shoulder length and stopping abruptly there, tipping slightly upward as it reached the end.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Sit up� she pointed at Dale with one hand, her other hand resting on her duty belt at her hip.&nbsp; The belt appeared to hold both a stun gun and a firearm, along with a myriad of other items including a tactical baton.&nbsp; Dale squirmed to try to get into an upright sitting position, but was somewhat groggy from sleep which slowed his progress.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �I mean NOW�, the guard shoved the female prisoner aside and withdrew the baton from her duty belt, which she pointed directly at Dale&#8217;s head.&nbsp; Dale quickly realized he was no longer dealing with a �nice� guard such as Tonya had been.&nbsp; He had known this bitch 10 seconds and she was already screaming at him and assuming a threatening position.&nbsp; Dale knew that in his state of restraint, he would be totally unable to protect himself if this woman were to begin swinging the baton at him.&nbsp; He sat up as straight as he could and hoped the guard would be satisfied.&nbsp; The guard said nothing but, to Dale&#8217;s relief, holstered the baton, then withdrew a set of keys from her belt, one of which she used to unfasten the small padlocks holding Dale&#8217;s ring gag onto his head.&nbsp; Within a few moments, Dale felt the straps being loosened and the harness being removed from his head.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guard now turned her attention to the female prisoner and said shortly �Feed him�.&nbsp; The female prisoner sat down beside Dale, having problems of her own getting situated with the restraints she had been fitted with.&nbsp; As she squirmed and maneuvered her barely-covered bottom around on the bed next to Dale, his eyes wandered downward to her thighs and the tops of her breasts.&nbsp; She was a finely-built woman, and even without her hair or makeup done she was very, very attractive to him.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dale was interrupted from his staring by the woman&#8217;s hand, which crossed the field of vision between Dale&#8217;s eyes and her body parts.&nbsp; She pulled upward as far as she could with her hand, but could not get the sandwich up far enough to reach Dale&#8217;s mouth.&nbsp; So she once again shifted herself on the bed to sit on her knees, which elevated her position enough to allow herself to feed him.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She held a sandwich in her hand.&nbsp; At first, Dale could not tell what kind of sandwich it was, but as he took a bite he recognized the bland taste of bologna.&nbsp; No mayonnaise, no mustard.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; Just bread and bologna.&nbsp; But it was more than he&#8217;d had in quite some time, so he ate it from her hand until it was gone.&nbsp; When he was finished, she held yet another sandwich out and proceeded to feed him that until he told her that it was enough, and she put the remaining part back onto the tray.&nbsp; Then she held up a cup to Dale, a plastic type with a straw protruding from the top.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t know what was in the cup, but pulled whatever it was up through the straw and into his mouth.&nbsp; He tasted cold water, which was fine as far as he was concerned.&nbsp; From what he could see, the company that ran this facility was not about to lose money on nutritional programs.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Dale had his fill of the water, he nodded to the woman who was only able to communicate with her eyes.&nbsp; She struggled hard to keep from drooling in a vain attempt to maintain some dignity, but as before in the shower room, wet spots evidenced her failure to keep her saliva from escaping the corners of her mouth which were forced open by the rubber ball wedged behind her teeth.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Get out� came an order from the guard who had monitored the feeding process.&nbsp; The female prisoner quickly got up from the bunk, and Dale watched her pick the tray up, turn around and shuffle out of the cell with it.&nbsp; He could see her continue to the other side of the hallway and kneel down in front of the wall onto her knees.&nbsp; She then crossed her chained ankles and lowered her head in a subservient position, awaiting her guard&#8217;s next orders.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Dale was watching the female inmate&#8217;s submissive ritual, he felt a hand grab his lower jaw as the guard pulled his face around to meet her gaze.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re new here, so I&#8217;ll introduce myself.&nbsp; My name is corporal Tracy Milford, and you apparently don&#8217;t have a name, but it doesn&#8217;t matter, because to me you&#8217;re just another man who probably thinks he can get anything he wants in this world because he has a penis.&nbsp; Understand, on this cell block, what I say is the law, and you have absolutely NO rights.&nbsp; You eat, breathe, and live only if I decide I want you to.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Corporal Milford was not telling Dale was that if he FAILED to live, she could face capitol charges, but she did not tell him that because she wanted to maintain an element of fear from him.&nbsp; Tracy had been hurt by a man once when she was young and had never forgotten it.&nbsp; Since that time, she took absolute pleasure in dominating men in every way imaginable every time one was incarcerated on her cell block. Tracy was one of the very people Tonya had referred to when she had warned him earlier about disobedience.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Up on your knees- face the wall� Tracy ordered Dale.&nbsp; He immediately squirmed to assume a sitting position on his knees.&nbsp; The chain attached to his right leg was just long enough to allow him to comply with her command to face the wall.&nbsp; Dale saw from the corner of his eye as Tracy picked up the ring gag harness from the bed beside him.&nbsp; He soon felt it being pulled over his head and the ring being unceremoniously popped into place behind his teeth.&nbsp; Then the straps tightened once more and soon locks were being clicked into place.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, Tracy forcibly shoved Dale down onto his stomach on the bed.&nbsp; Dale laid still offering no resistance, fearing what may result from it if he did.&nbsp; Tracy unlocked the connecting chain from the wall, then unlocked the other end from Dale&#8217;s leg.&nbsp; Dale soon felt his feet being pulled up behind him, then a leg cuff being applied to his left leg.&nbsp; Tracy then pulled the other side of the leg irons up through Dale&#8217;s handcuffs, then wrapped the chain from the leg irons around the cuffs a few times to shorten it.&nbsp; Then she attached the other side of the restraints to Dale&#8217;s right leg, once again putting Dale into a hog tie position, albeit a slightly looser one than Tonya and Melissa had employed earlier in a few instances.&nbsp; Not totally satisfied with that, she re-used the connecting chain to attach the center links of Dale&#8217;s leg irons to the ring in the wall near the foot of the bed.&nbsp; There would be no getting up to pee now, and Tracy didn&#8217;t seem concerned in the least.&nbsp; After all, she probably had inmates clean up soiled linens�.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Satisfied that Dale was totally immobile for the evening, she turned out the light over his bunk and walked out of the cell, closing the door with a loud clang.&nbsp; As the door closed, Dale could see his female prisoner counterpart still facing the wall in the hallway.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the door now closed and the light out, Dale could barely see anything.&nbsp; There was a small sliver of light coming from under the door.&nbsp; That was about all.&nbsp; And Dale began to have the urge to pee, but there was no way now that he could reach the toilet.&nbsp; And here came the infernal drool again.&nbsp; Dale worried about his newest captor, this corporal named Tracy.&nbsp; What would she do if he wet the bed, he wondered�And after having slept earlier, he had no idea what time it was or how long it would be until he would be released from his current state of bondage, or who would come for him next.&nbsp; Dale was in for a long, uncomfortable stay.&nbsp; But it beat the previous night spent in an unforgiving arm binder, swinging to and fro in a&nbsp; bundling bag chained to the inner frame of an APC.&nbsp; Dale figured his situation had actually improved as he slowly began to doze back off into a fitful and uncomfortable sleep.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 









Postapocalypto 5



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Craig&#8217;s father had opened the Irish restaurant twenty years before the Great Conflict and had been among the first to die in its wake.&nbsp; Craig inherited the restaurant, which had always been successful.&nbsp; Despite difficult times during the war and ensuing turmoil, he had managed to keep the small business alive, never allowing the specters of apathy or greed to overtake the principles of good business his father had taught him.&nbsp; Now 38, Craig had worked at the restaurant all his life and spent long hours cooking, cleaning, and in the evenings walked from table to table to greet his guests.&nbsp; He was not getting rich, but at least made enough money to keep his financial head above water, or so he thought.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Business aside, all was not well for Craig.&nbsp; He had married a woman named Maria shortly after the virus had wiped most males from the face of the earth.&nbsp; At the time he was very much in love with her and had been for over two years.&nbsp; But Maria did not share Craig&#8217;s work ethic and rarely if ever helped out around the restaurant, instead spending her time shopping and depleting Craig&#8217;s bank account.&nbsp; It was a classic case of �keeping up with the Jones&#8217;�.&nbsp; Craig and Maria lived in his father&#8217;s old house, his mother having moved away to live with her sister who had also lost her husband during the conflict.&nbsp; The house was in a fine old neighborhood and most residents there came from old money.&nbsp; Maria, never lifting a finger to do any type of work, socialized constantly with her neighbors and Craig struggled to keep up with her expensive tastes, over time incurring a rather large amount of debt.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At work, Craig depended on the help of a departed best friend&#8217;s daughter, Sarah, and several of her college friends that rotated in and out as their schedules permitted.&nbsp; At any given time, there would be up to 5 young women working in the restaurant with Craig.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Craig often came home to Maria&#8217;s ill temper, and although he had always adored her, had recently begun to doubt that she would ever change.&nbsp; Maria constantly accused him of cheating on her, and although he never did, Craig was starting to think of ways to keep from being around her.&nbsp; A benefit of the long hours at the restaurant was that he would not have to come home to endure the constant bickering over alleged cheating, not to mention he didn&#8217;t have to hear what new debt Maria had incurred that day.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Craig believed that life had become difficult enough with all that had happened in the past several years, with so many people, especially men, having died in the war.&nbsp; And he was not a fan of the political ramifications of suddenly becoming a distinct minority but was unable to do much about it.&nbsp; There were few men to chat with about the weather, even fewer that shared Craig&#8217;s appetite for political topics.&nbsp; Most men, in fact, had embraced the idea of the near 10:1 ratio of women to men for their own sexual pleasure, a ratio that went even higher as years went by and many men fled to the freedom of the colonies.&nbsp; Craig saw things differently since he had been so taken with Maria.&nbsp; Although he looked at other women like any heterosexual male would, he continued to remain faithful to her despite the problems she presented him.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Politically, Craig was concerned about the growing number of laws governing the rights of the male population.&nbsp; These laws were being introduced one by one in the name of safety, most based on a premise that men were a precious human resource and that certain behaviors and activities threatened this resource.&nbsp; As a result, anything considered the least bit dangerous was made illegal.&nbsp; Extreme sports, gun ownership, fast food, smoking, and even driving a motor vehicle were outlawed.&nbsp; Additionally, any inherently dangerous occupations were outlawed for males, law enforcement and military jobs, especially. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where vehicles were concerned, men were relegated to the �safety� of the back seat of cars to be driven only by females and prohibited from riding in two-seaters or convertibles altogether.&nbsp; They were, by law, forced to wear 3-point harnesses and in some areas even helmets. On planes and trains, men were also required to be strapped into a restraint harness of a �safe seat� by female attendants.&nbsp; They were not allowed to get up for any reason while the vehicle was in motion.&nbsp; If they attempted to get up, attendants were authorized to place locks on the harnesses or use whatever force necessary to immobilize the male traveler, for safety, of course.&nbsp; In addition, the safe seats would be located in the safest areas near the back of a train or behind the wings of aircraft.&nbsp; Meanwhile, women traveled as they always had, moving about the cabins of planes or trains with relative freedom.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As these types of safety laws began to be introduced, many men saw the writing on the wall outlining an even more �safe� future and thus began the mass exodus from the cities to form colonies in the abandoned outer regions.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the safety laws, men were now subject to be stopped by law enforcement officials and could be arrested and detained for up to 7 days without being charged.&nbsp; This law was passed out of concern for the large numbers of men leaving and was an attempt to thwart efforts by a type of underground movement to smuggle men out of the cities.&nbsp; Anything to disrupt clandestine meetings between suspected defectors and their fellow conspirators was considered acceptable.&nbsp; It was explained to male citizens in no uncertain terms that if they were challenged by law enforcement, be it a public agency or a private one, he was to comply immediately and without resistance, physical or verbal.&nbsp; Violations could include significant jail time.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Men were required to carry identification at all times.&nbsp; Men without identification were apprehended immediately and such violations included mandatory jail sentences of up to 30 days.&nbsp; Men soon found themselves being stopped for no reason whatsoever, sometimes more than once a day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to all the &#8216;safety&#8217; laws, Craig was very concerned about the growing number of men disappearing from the streets the past couple of years.&nbsp; When the police or military agencies arrested someone, there would be a record almost immediately and the person could at least be tracked to a detention facility.&nbsp; With the growing number of private firms being retained for security and safety purposes, many of which also utilized private detention centers, public records were not updated nearly as quickly.&nbsp; It was widely-rumored that in some cases the private firms were complicit in all-out kidnapping.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the questionable ethics of the private companies, there was also a thriving organized criminal element active in illegal kidnapping and slave trading.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rumors flew about what was happening to these men among the citizenry.&nbsp; The general (and correct) assumption was that they were being kidnapped and sold as slaves on the black market.&nbsp; This was disturbing enough to Craig, but even more disturbing was the apparent lack of concern not only among the general population, but also on the part of law-enforcement agencies.&nbsp; Craig felt there was a conspiracy in place that involved officials in high places.&nbsp; Despite his concerns, he usually worked so many hours that he had little time to think about it.

_____________________________________________________________
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maria did not like Craig being gone every day.&nbsp; She did not like other women being around him whatsoever, even Sarah and her friends that worked for Craig.&nbsp; She came into the restaurant almost daily, never to work, but to check up on Craig and did her best to run off Sarah and her college age girlfriends, not caring that it hurt the business each time Craig had to try to find a new girl and train her. She constantly lobbied Craig to sell the restaurant, confident that the sale would provide plenty of money to live on for the rest of their lives.&nbsp; Craig showed her on paper, on several occasions that their debts would swallow up most proceeds from the sale, should it occur, and that there would be little or nothing left to live on.&nbsp; But still, Maria persisted, and as time went on the two of them arrived at an impasse on the subject.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maria continued to spend her time fretting, and consoled herself by blowing money on clothes and useless overpriced trinkets from specialty shops all over the city.&nbsp; She spent a lot of time with her best friend, Susan, who provided Maria an ear for her perceived woes as well as a shoulder to cry on when Maria could not bend Craig to her will.&nbsp;&nbsp; Susan never said much to Craig when she was around him.&nbsp; She simply smiled at him and never got involved in spats between the couple, often declining Maria&#8217;s request for her opinion when attempting to make a point to Craig.&nbsp; Susan did not have a husband or regular boyfriend, although she was a very attractive 35 year old blonde real-estate agent who met more than her share of men and had plenty of sexual experience with them.&nbsp; Susan&#8217;s problem was that she was very career-oriented and most men, being in short supply, were accustomed to women that catered to their every whim and hung on their every word.&nbsp; Susan had her own life and was not the type to try too hard to keep a man.&nbsp; As a result, most would move on to women they felt would do more for them.&nbsp; Occasionally, Susan would meet a guy that was actually drawn to her aloof nature, but she enjoyed variety too much to fall for any one man.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Susan secretly envied Maria.&nbsp; Not because Maria was married, but rather for the big house, the nice clothes, the nice automobile she drove.&nbsp; These were all things that Susan wanted but was too good a businesswoman to buy for herself.&nbsp; She practiced extreme monetary discipline and lived in a very small apartment.&nbsp; Although she always looked sharp, she was no stranger to the thrift stores in town.&nbsp; She drove a nice older German car, but had no payments on it.&nbsp; She piled money up in her stock trading accounts, making conservative stock picks with her savings that netted her an additional side income.&nbsp; She planned to use it one day to open her own brokerage.&nbsp; She had heard Craig complain to Maria on more than one occasion about their mounting debts, and as a result knew that all was not as Maria was presenting to the rest of the world.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over time, Susan devised a plan to put her dreams into fast-forward mode�.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Craig took the train home every night, not just because he wasn&#8217;t allowed to drive, but more because he had always used the train.&nbsp; He had not driven a car in over 8 years, rarely driving one even back then.&nbsp; Still, he was shocked when one of the first safety laws was enacted that voided his driver&#8217;s license.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, he had always carried a gun, but even before the driver&#8217;s licenses were taken away from men they had been disarmed.&nbsp; Craig had continued to carry a gun anyway for quite some time, but in the past few years had decided it was too risky since he could be stopped for literally no reason by police and searched.&nbsp; He decided that even though he fiercely resented the gun ban, he would, for now anyway, abide by it.&nbsp; The worst thing was that it was perfectly legal for women to own firearms and most did.&nbsp; So it left him very susceptible to female muggers, or worse, kidnappers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If he were caught with a firearm he would be cooling his heels in prison for at least a year, possibly more.&nbsp; A year was the mandatory sentence.&nbsp; No parole, no probation, no exceptions.&nbsp; The law seemed counterintuitive to him.&nbsp; After all, with the kidnappings so rampant, would it not be prudent for a man to be able to defend himself?&nbsp;&nbsp; But he knew that the gun ban had more to do with the government&#8217;s fear that men would revolt than their concern for his freedom and &#8216;safety&#8217;.&nbsp; The general ideas fed to the public to justify these laws centered on the conservation of men as a precious resource.&nbsp; But most affected men felt that was only a thinly-veiled disguise of the fact that the females who held power wanted to eliminate any threats posed by an armed, mobile, and free male population.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A young, dark-haired female attendant wearing a dark red sweater and an above-the-knee black wool skirt stood inside the train&#8217;s �safety� car and smiled at Craig as he walked on board.&nbsp; A badge on her sweater denoted her position as an employee of the city rail system, and an S on the opposite side of her sweater further identified her as a security liaison.&nbsp; She wore a radio on a wide black belt but appeared to be unarmed, although there were a few pouches containing unknown items also on the belt. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he got inside, he noticed 3 other men already seated in their safety seats.&nbsp; These were large, well-padded seats with side-impact cushions for the head.&nbsp; Each seat had a 3-point harness; two straps that went over each shoulder, buckling into a center module attached to a strap that ran down between the legs.&nbsp; Each strap had buckles to adjust tightness.&nbsp; These safety seats also had other features, such as zippered compartments on the inside of the armrests and at the bottom of the seat behind the knees. Craig had ascertained at some point in time from an attendant that these features were for prisoner transport, and that the zippered compartments held restraints.&nbsp; It had occurred to him at the time that he never saw prisoners being transported in these train cars.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Craig sat down in his seat, quickly snapping the harness together loosely as usual, not bothering to tighten it.&nbsp; He felt like a 3-year old having to even sit in this seat, and resented his lack of choice in the matter.&nbsp; He&#8217;d be damned if he were going to strap himself in tightly like the diagram showed. The picture showed a man strapped in as if he was in a hang-glider (which, as it happened, was now illegal for men).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Craig put his briefcase down between the seat and the window.&nbsp; As he attempted to settle into the seat, the attendant walked over to him.&nbsp; �Sir, today is the first day for the new transport rules.&nbsp; My name is Alicia.&nbsp; May I assist you with your harness before I apply the new measures?�&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Craig looked at the young woman, dumbfounded.&nbsp; He had no idea what she was talking about.&nbsp; What new measures?&nbsp; Craig looked around behind him at the other seated men.&nbsp; Immediately he noticed what he had missed on his way in: The prisoner restraint straps had been employed to affix their wrists to the armrests.&nbsp; Looking down, he saw their feet had been strapped together and were connected to the frames below their seats.&nbsp; None of the men looked to be very happy.&nbsp; They all just looked straight ahead at Craig and the attendant.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Craig turned his attention back to Alicia, who continued to smile pleasantly.&nbsp; �What&#8217;s this all about� Why are those other men tied down like that?&nbsp; Are they prisoners?&nbsp; Oh, I&#8217;m not a prisoner�&nbsp; Look, I have my papers in order here�let me get them for you.�&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alicia continued to smile and laughed softly.&nbsp; �No those men are not prisoners, but the new government rules state that on public transportation, new security measures are to be taken.&nbsp; Unfortunately, those measures include a greater deal of restraint than you&#8217;re currently used to.&nbsp; But really, the straps are comfortable- you&#8217;ll get used to them in time, I think.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Well, you think wrong�..Alicia.� Craig stumbled to remember her first name, although her badge read her last name, �Morrison�.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Sir, I am very sorry, but did you not already hear about this on the news or somewhere?&nbsp; Most of the gentlemen today were already informed before they got here, and we passed out informational flyers earlier today on the morning routes.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government almost constantly passed out informational flyers at busy public places such as train stations, but Craig usually ignored them. �I, uh, saw some flyers, but didn&#8217;t read them.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t understand the need for prisoner restraints used on law-abiding citizens.&nbsp; What reason did they give you girls for it?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Apparently, many criminals use the trains and buses to get around the city, and sometimes we attendants identify them from APBs but are unable to keep them in custody until the police arrive.&nbsp; This way, if we identify a criminal using our system, we will be able to keep him restrained until help comes�.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �That&#8217;s the lamest excuse I&#8217;ve ever heard to deprive people of their freedom of movement!&nbsp; These glorified child restraint seats were already bad enough.&nbsp; And what about female criminals?&nbsp; Do none of those ever ride the trains?�&nbsp; Craig&#8217;s voice steadily raised as he talked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Sir, I&#8217;m very sorry you&#8217;re upset, but it is not my decision.&nbsp; I am only here to ensure your adherence to the rules and your comfort to the best of my ability.&nbsp; Please do not be angry with me.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �No, of course not.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not your fault- you have a job to do, I suppose� Craig&#8217;s voice toned down considerably, not wanting to give Alicia any reason to summon police.&nbsp; He could not believe that he had not heard about this new mandate, and that such a law could even pass muster in the legislative process.&nbsp; But it wasn&#8217;t the first ridiculous assault on basic human freedom he had witnessed, by far.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Very well, so will you be wanting to ride the train tonight, or do you have another way to get home, sir?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Uh, no.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have another way home.&nbsp; I guess I&#8217;ll be staying on board.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Ok, then, so can you tighten your harness for me, or would you like me to do it?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Oh, no, I can do it.�&nbsp; With that, Craig tightened the two upper buckles, pulling them a bit tighter to his shoulders and chest.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Alright, now if you would kindly put your arms on the sides of the chair for me, please�.�&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Craig did as he was instructed, not happy about the situation at all, but feeling somewhat defeated at this point.&nbsp; He watched as Alicia pulled wide heavy velcro straps up from inside the zippered compartments of the armrests.&nbsp; She proceeded to wrap his right wrist two times, then pulled his arm down flush to the rest, pulling the end of the strap down through a slot and back up to adhere to the top of the velcro around his wrist.&nbsp; She smoothed it down, rendering his arm useless, then leaned over him and repeated the process on his left wrist.&nbsp; She then bent down and wrapped a large double velcro strap around his ankles twice.&nbsp; This double strap was reinforced with metal bands sewn to the inside, and had a chain protruding from between the two sections which was already attached to the frame of the seat.&nbsp; Craig had about 6 inches of play in the chain, more than he had with his hands.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Alicia finished with the restraints, a relatively quick process that she had evidently repeated all day long, she leaned in on Craig once more and pulled the buckles of his shoulder straps a couple of tugs tighter than he had, smiling down at him as she did it.&nbsp; She then reached down between his legs and pulled that strap nice and snug as well.&nbsp; Craig felt her hand brush against the inside of his legs more than once, but wasn&#8217;t sure if she had done it purposefully or not.&nbsp; As he pondered that, Alicia took a ring of keys from her belt and stuck one of them into the module on the safety harness, turning the key to the left and locking it.&nbsp; Now the release button on the buckle module was deactivated until the key was reinserted.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Thanks for your cooperation, sir.&nbsp; I hope you are reasonably comfortable for the ride home.&nbsp; Please signal me 30 seconds before we reach your stop so I&#8217;ll be able to get you unstrapped as quickly as possible.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Craig knew it was going to be approximately 25 minutes before he would reach his stop, so he begrudgingly settled into his seat and awaited the beginning of his trip.&nbsp; He was the last male to come on board at this stop, and the doors closed and the train began to move.&nbsp; 8 stops later, he was the last male on the entire train car.&nbsp; Craig pressed a button near the end of the armrest as they approached his stop.&nbsp; A light mounted above his window next to his seat gave Alicia the signal.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alicia walked up from behind him.&nbsp; She was talking on her radio and although Craig was quite ready to be released, she stood beside him for a moment, listening to someone on the other end.&nbsp; �Will you please repeat your last message� he heard her say into the radio.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He heard a garbled sound coming from the tiny speaker, and could make out a word every couple of seconds.&nbsp; He heard the words �possibly armed� and �detain immediately� quite clearly.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Ten-Four� Craig heard Alicia say into the radio.&nbsp; She harnessed the radio and looked over at Craig, shaking her head left to right. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �What&#8217;s going on? Why aren&#8217;t you unstrapping me?�&nbsp; demanded Craig.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Sir, I&#8217;ve been ordered to keep you right where you are for now�.&nbsp; As she talked, Alicia seemed to be looking for something near Craig.&nbsp; As she spotted his briefcase, she leaned over him and took it into her possession.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Hey, that&#8217;s not yours. What&#8217;s your problem, lady?� Craig began to yell as Alicia opened his briefcase.&nbsp; What she pulled out caused Craig to lose his voice and made his skin go pale.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alicia held a semi-automatic 9mm Browning handgun by the grips.&nbsp; It was Craig&#8217;s gun, but he knew he hadn&#8217;t placed it into the briefcase.&nbsp; Craig was at a loss for words at first, but then began to try to reason with Alicia.&nbsp;&nbsp; �Please, please�I don&#8217;t know how that got in there�please believe me.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve got absolutely no criminal record.&nbsp; Please, if you turn that in, my life will be ruined.�&nbsp; On and on Craig went, doing his best to try to appeal to Alicia any way he could, but she was having none of it.&nbsp; All she knew is that this man had brought a firearm onto her train and it was her responsibility to apprehend him immediately.&nbsp; Besides, the order to keep Craig in custody was from the police.&nbsp; It was not her decision.&nbsp; At this point she was scared of this man, who could have shot somebody for all she knew.&nbsp; As far as she was concerned, he was going absolutely nowhere.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Craig began to panic and started pulling frantically at the velcro straps, but they held very firmly to both his surprise and his horror.&nbsp; He remembered thinking as Alicia applied the straps that they didn&#8217;t look to be capable of holding a man in place.&nbsp; They were velcro, after all�.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he slowly gave up struggling, he thought of the consequences for carrying a firearm.&nbsp; Although he didn&#8217;t think those consequences were fair, he knew it didn&#8217;t matter what he thought.&nbsp; He was looking at a year behind bars at least.&nbsp; He trusted nobody to run the business, especially Maria who would undoubtedly assume control of it in his absence.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within only a couple of minutes, two city police officers were on board the train car with Craig and Alicia.&nbsp; Alicia greeted them and led them over to where Craig was still firmly attached to his safety seat.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �This is him� she pointed. �And this is what he had with him� she said as she held up the suitcase, opening it slightly to show the officers what was inside it, but trying not to let it be seen by passers by. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Alright, thank you.&nbsp; We will take him as quickly as we can so you can get this train moving again.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alicia nodded affirmatively, then looked condescendingly down at Craig as she walked back to stand by the open doorway of the train car.&nbsp; As Craig looked up and saw her disgusted look, feelings of anger began to well up in him.&nbsp; Not just because somebody had obviously set him up, but more because he felt it was his basic human right as a law-abiding citizen to carry a gun anyway.&nbsp; Furthermore, it was his right to not be strapped into a seat on a train without just cause.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The officers took up positions, one beside his seat and one behind him.&nbsp; He could only see the one to his right side, noticing that she was a regular city cop and not of a private security firm, which was a bit of a relief.&nbsp; She had neck-length brown hair and brown eyes.&nbsp; She wore a typical law-enforcement/military uniform;&nbsp;&nbsp; tight-fitting black pants with large pockets on the outer thighs, knee-high black leather boots, and a tight grey-colored shirt under a short black jacket.&nbsp; Around her waist was a duty belt with a gun, a nightstick, a radio, and several equipment pouches of varying size.&nbsp; A badge adorned the jacket with a sewn-in name patch reading �Petrov�.&nbsp; She wore a ballcap that bore the outline of a police badge on the front.&nbsp; She looked to be in her late 20&#8217;s, a bit taller than most women. Judging by her tightly-clad muscular legs, she was quite athletic.&nbsp; Although nearly all policewomen operated in pairs if not groups, she looked as if she may present a physical challenge to most men if it came to it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �All right, I guess you know you&#8217;ll be coming with us tonight� she declared.&nbsp; �You are under arrest.&nbsp; You are hereby removed from any rights you have as a citizen and are now subject to the male detainee code of the Unified Nations until your case is presented in court.&nbsp; You will be provided a counselor upon your incarceration to assist with any transitional or other personal issues.&nbsp; Do you understand this declaration?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Craig nodded his head up and down, the word �yes� coming quietly from his lips.&nbsp; He knew by experience that he would only incur grief from these women if he resisted in any way.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Very good. Now, my partner and I would like to make this process go as smoothly as possible.&nbsp; For this to occur, we need your full cooperation.&nbsp; Do we have that?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, Craig nodded his head in the affirmative.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Well, it&#8217;s not very enthusiastic, but it will do.&nbsp; Please know that resistance of any kind will be dealt with harshly�.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Craig continued to nod, and had already decided against putting up any kind of resistance.&nbsp; Surely there was still some way out of this misunderstanding, he thought.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, Officer Petrov nodded to her partner behind Craig to be ready.&nbsp; She leaned over him and with a key unlocked the safety restraint buckle near his waist, pulling the two shoulder straps back and over his head behind the chair.&nbsp; Then, leaning further in, she removed the velcro restraint from his left arm.&nbsp; When she finished, she pulled Craig&#8217;s arm up and behind his head, where her partner took it firmly by the wrist and held it with one hand while attaching one side of a pair of hinged handcuffs.&nbsp; Petrov then took Craig&#8217;s other strapped arm and proceeded to free it from the arm of the chair.&nbsp; She pulled his right hand up behind his head and gave control of it to her partner.&nbsp; Craig was then instructed to lean forward as far as he could in the seat and place his head between his legs.&nbsp; As he did that, he felt Petrov&#8217;s hand on his back firmly holding him down while her partner brought his hands down behind his back, turned his wrists facing palms out, then applied the second handcuff with a quick motion.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When that process was finished and Craig&#8217;s hands were safely restrained behind him, they pulled him back into the seat once more and Officer Petrov knelt down in front of Craig&#8217;s ankles.&nbsp; Before beginning to remove the straps, Petrov withdrew a set of leg cuffs from her duty belt and placed them one at a time around Craig&#8217;s ankles, just below where the velcro restraints were.&nbsp; Once she was satisfied that he would not go unfettered, it was a quick process for her to pull the velcro straps loose.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout the process, Craig had noticed that there was almost no period of time when he was not restrained, except for the moment right before his hands were being cuffed together behind his back.&nbsp; Even then he was bent forward, not in a good position of leverage, and his feet had been strapped together and to the seat frame.&nbsp; He would not have been able to make an effective escape attempt had he chosen to try.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �OK, up with you�up up up, come on now� Petrov chirped quickly and somewhat forcibly.&nbsp; Craig struggled a bit to stand, unable to push himself up with his hands.&nbsp; Once he stood, the officers took him by each arm and guided him out from between the seats, then turned him back to his right, allowing him to see his other captor for the first time.&nbsp; She was also dark-haired, but hers was longer than her partner&#8217;s, coming down to the tops of her shoulder blades and tied up in a ponytail.&nbsp; Her uniform was identical to Petrov&#8217;s and read �Simmons�.&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked to be about the same age as Petrov, and was a half-head shorter.&nbsp; She had a smaller build as well, but appeared to have much larger breasts than her counterpart.&nbsp; Even though she wore a jacket over her tight shirt, her breasts protruded to the point that the lapel bent out slightly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Craig was clear of the seats and out in the aisle, Petrov walked around him to his left.&nbsp; He could see her withdrawing something from her right side as she moved.&nbsp; His eyes and head turned to follow her.&nbsp; A pair of hands belonging to Simmons immediately grabbed him firmly by each side of his face, correcting his position to her will.&nbsp; �Face forward� she said, not loudly but with authority.&nbsp; Craig&#8217;s eyes went forward, first down to her eyes and face, and then, almost uncontrollably, to her ample rack.&nbsp; Even though no cleavage was showing, there was just no way for her to hide what she was keeping under the shirt she wore.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Petrov pulled Craig&#8217;s cuffed hands up and forward away from her, causing him to bend forward a few inches, as a result bringing him even closer to the afore-mentioned boobs. Simmons reached over Craig and took his cuffed wrists into both hands, holding him in an improvised strapedo position while her partner frisked him thoroughly, going so far as to reach down into his pants to check for any contraband. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she was finished frisking him, Petrov withdrew a device from her belt.&nbsp; Over the hinged part of the handcuffs, she placed the device which she locked into place to further restrict his hand movement.&nbsp; It was a flat steel box that fit perfectly between the two cuffs, instantly converting them from hinged to rigid. This box also covered the keyholes on the handcuffs making it impossible to pick those locks.&nbsp; It locked in place using a completely different and far more complex key than the handcuffs themselves and was not likely to be picked even by an expert.&nbsp; In addition, it more than quadrupled the strength of the handcuffs themselves, which were quite sturdy and virtually impossible to break even by the strongest of prisoners.&nbsp; When she completed the task, she nodded to her partner, Paula Simmons, who had been busy withdrawing a long connecting chain about 1.5 meters in length.&nbsp; One end of the chain had a heavy large oval ring on one end.&nbsp; This she wrapped around Craig&#8217;s waist and pulled one end through the oval ring.&nbsp; She then tightened the chain through the ring and let the end drop down in front of Dale&#8217;s waist.&nbsp; From behind, Demetria Petrov pulled the ring back and up between Craig&#8217;s thighs, ran the chain up and over where it circled his waist behind him, and then pulled back and down, effectively burying the chain between Craig&#8217;s butt cheeks as she pulled it tight.&nbsp; She chose a suitable link in the chain which would leave Craig very little slack, then attached a small padlock between it and a heavy steel ring welded to the newly-applied metal box which now framed the center of his handcuffs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without hesitation, Petrov withdrew a length of connecting chain from her duty belt, locked one end to Craig&#8217;s ankle chain, then took the other end up to the padlock attaching the box on his handcuffs to his crotch chain.&nbsp; She quickly undid this lock and slipped a link of the chain from his ankles onto it to join the chain from his crotch.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was not worried about the small lock being put under too much stress, as it was made of titanium and had a 4,000kg rating.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking over at the young Alicia, who was watching the restraint process with much interest, Demetria mouthed the words �one more minute� silently, knowing that people were still waiting for the train to get moving.&nbsp; Several bystanders outside the train were looking in through the open door of the safety car to see what was going on, and Alicia had held one gentleman at the door until Petrov signaled her.&nbsp; With that, Alicia ushered the man in and began to get him prepared for the train ride.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paula was now ready to apply the final touches to Craig for his trip to jail.&nbsp; She carried a ball gag in her large inner jacket pocket which she withdrew and straightened the straps on as Craig watched.&nbsp; It buckled behind the head and under the chin.&nbsp; �Open up wide� she stated as she held the device up to Craig&#8217;s mouth.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Oh, no, come on..are you really serious?� finally letting his frustration get the better of him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A hand reached around from behind him and Craig soon found himself in Demetria&#8217;s version of a chokehold.&nbsp; �FULL cooperation� she softly said into his ear.&nbsp; �Remember?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowing that he had no chance of winning this argument or any ensuing attempts at physical resistance, Craig nodded and grunted �Umm-hmmm� in response to Petrov&#8217;s persuasions.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He opened widely and accepted the large black ball into his mouth, always having wondered what one tasted like.&nbsp; Soon he was finding out as the lady cops were tightening the buckles on the device as snugly as they felt they could without breaking his jaw.&nbsp; There would be no pushing the ball out, he knew, as the straps were pulled uncomfortably tight, especially the one at the back.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next thing Craig knew, a thick black fabric bag was being pulled over his head.&nbsp; It had a series of small holes around the bottom with metal grommets in them.&nbsp; A sturdy cord ran through these holes which was soon being tied in the back by Demetria.&nbsp; This prevented Craig from seeing in any direction.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he was ready for his final open air walk for quite some time to come, and the policewomen led him off the train.&nbsp; As he walked to the door, he could hear the sound of velcro being applied by the cute attendant, Alicia, to her latest passenger, her girlish voice spinning the words �I hope you will be comfortable, sir.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demetria Petrov took Craig&#8217;s left elbow in her right arm and carried his briefcase with the prohibited firearm inside with her left.&nbsp; Simmons took his right elbow into her left arm and the trio walked at Craig&#8217;s abbreviated pace to the escalators leading up to the street level.&nbsp; Craig could hear many female voices all around but had no idea how many people were staring at him. He was a bit relieved that the black sack covered his face.&nbsp; He was always embarrassed whenever he was restrained publicly.&nbsp; He found it degrading and humiliating, never getting used to the idea even knowing that most all men endured the same treatment on a regular basis.&nbsp; If it were not for the restaurant and his wife, he would have probably attempted to make a break for the free colonies long before now�.

PostApocalypto, Chapter 6

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Craig could not help but wonder why all this extra security was necessary.&nbsp; Being strapped into the train seat was starting to look rather comfortable compared to what had just been applied to him.&nbsp; Like most men living in the cities, he had been stopped on several occasions by police and security agencies.&nbsp; Without exception, every time he had been stopped he had been handcuffed behind his back, as per procedure. On one occasion he had even been chained at his feet and put into a chained hog-tie, forced to lay face-down on a wet sidewalk by an overly-enthusiastic rookie until his identification had been validated.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only was he accustomed to these indignities, but he was also used to yet another routine assault on his pride and freedoms known as R.E.P.A.R.E. drills.&nbsp; (Restraint, Evacuation, Protection, Attack Readiness Exercise).&nbsp; These monthly drills involved all males city wide being immediately detained by police, security, or military personnel for relocation to predetermined �safe havens�.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If none of the above were available, it was incumbent upon any able adult female citizen (preferably more than one) to take custody of a nearby male.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event of invasion by an enemy force, all males were to be immediately arrested (it was mandated they be restrained for their own &#8216;safety&#8217;) and escorted to the nearest safe haven, places within the city specifically designed to house humanity&#8217;s most precious resource.&nbsp; Once yearly, the exercise would be carried out fully, meaning that all detainees would be required to be brought into preliminary safe zones.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Craig, like most men, didn&#8217;t like the exercises but, with the exception of the once-yearly full exercise, the process never lasted more than 20 or 30 minutes.&nbsp; Nobody ever knew the exact time or day of the drills, so it was impossible to avoid them.&nbsp; On most occasions, the audible citywide alarms would sound during the middle of the workday, along with the alarm broadcast on radio, television and computer networks.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever he was doing, regardless of how busy he may be, Craig would have to stop everything, kneel in the floor, cross his ankles, place his hands behind his head and wait to be detained.&nbsp; Rarely was a policewoman in the restaurant during the alarm, so his detention was typically the responsibility of the girls that worked for him.&nbsp; Given the instance of being hog-cuffed on the wet pavement by the rookie cop, he preferred the girls over the police or military anytime. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the first few drills, Craig had been restrained with a variety of items ranging from a phone cord to a sash from around the waist of a nearby customer.&nbsp; He finally had the idea to purchase a nice set of steel handcuffs with almost a foot of chain between the manacles.&nbsp; These were far more comfortable than having his hands tied closely together.&nbsp; He kept the manacles in a counter drawer under the cash register so all the girls would know where to find them when the alarms sounded.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All young women were required to take a two-day security course in high school as part of their physical education. There they learned to properly approach, subdue, and handcuff a subject.&nbsp; In addition, most girls took advantage of free career workshops offered by private security firms.&nbsp; These workshops provided opportunities to skip a day or two of school in favor of field trips to detention facilities where they learned advanced techniques to subdue and&nbsp; restrain an individual in the absence of proper equipment.&nbsp; As a result of this type of training being so readily available to young women, rarely was Craig not tied securely or properly by Sarah and her girlfriends, but before he purchased the handcuffs he never knew just what they would use on him.&nbsp; The police and military personnel at the safe zones frowned somewhat at the extra length of chain between the handcuffs Craig had chosen for himself, but they never ordered a change, only suggested it.&nbsp; They actually preferred rope or even properly-applied tape over long handcuff chains, which they considered all but useless.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once yearly, a second alarm would sound instructing all males and their &#8216;protectors&#8217; on to the safe havens.&nbsp; Craig&#8217;s girls would usually have to shut the restaurant down, leaving a couple behind to tend to remaining customers, then transport him either by car or by foot several blocks to the local high school gymnasium.&nbsp; Designated a primary safe zone, it was basically a holding area where men would be processed and readied for transport to more secure, longer-term facilities.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the girls loved when this would happen, as they would often get up to an entire day off from work.&nbsp; And they were always good about teasing their boss, sometimes taking advantage of his somewhat helpless situation by tickling him or playfully spanking him.&nbsp; Overall they were good-natured, and tried their best to brighten Craig&#8217;s mood as the drills, especially the yearly full drill, highly annoyed him and cost him a lot of money.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only two times in the past several years had the alarm sounded in the evening after Craig had returned home from work.&nbsp; The first time, he told Maria not to worry about it, that it was only a drill and surely nobody would know if they did not follow through with the restraint procedures.&nbsp; Unfortunately, a nosy neighbor from next door had witnessed Craig through the kitchen window retrieving snacks from the refrigerator.&nbsp; Within minutes of being summoned by the neighbor, policewomen were standing in Craig&#8217;s living room over the prone, handcuffed figures of Craig as well as Maria, who was charged with aiding the refusal to participate in a R.E.P.A.R.E. drill, a misdemeanor which carried a small fine. Craig was charged with primary refusal to participate, a charge levied only on males.&nbsp; The punishment could have yielded up to 90 days incarceration.&nbsp; Luckily for Craig, one of Maria&#8217;s friends was an attorney and she was able to get his sentence reduced to a few days served and a hefty fine, given his lack of a previous criminal record.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the second time Craig was at home for an alarm, he did not argue with Maria&#8217;s insistence on getting him restrained.&nbsp; She was especially worried that given what had happened the last time, police might pay a visit to ensure compliance this time around.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike most girls nowadays, Maria had never been trained in any type of restraint procedure, but she had learned many sailor&#8217;s knots from her father who owned a sailboat and took her out on the water regularly as a young woman.&nbsp; After the non-compliance incident with the police, Maria took time to locate a long clothesline rope in the basement of their house and stored it in a coil in the hall closet, not wanting to be unprepared in the event of another alarm.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the sirens began to wail outside and the alarm came across the television, she got up immediately from the bed to retrieve the rope.&nbsp; Craig was just exiting the shower and had only managed to don a pair of silk boxers when he heard the sounds.&nbsp; From the bathroom, he saw Maria, nearly naked herself, dart out into the hallway and down the stairs.&nbsp; Shortly thereafter, he heard her calling him.&nbsp; �Craig, honey, we may as well do this down here so you won&#8217;t have to walk as far all tied up.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Craig could see her point, sort of.&nbsp; He knew, first of all, that he would be wasting his time arguing with her about whether they should participate in the drill.&nbsp; As much as he felt trampled upon by the new laws, he feared what may happen if Maria&#8217;s fears were realized and the police showed up to find the couple not in compliance.&nbsp; He walked down the stairs and into the living room where Maria stood, wearing only a short, almost completely transparent gown that stopped just below her waist.&nbsp; It was white and contrasted nicely against her dark brown hair. She normally did not wear anything so revealing to bed, opting instead for something warm and comfortable, and usually boring.&nbsp; He could see through the fabric of the gown that she wore a tiny white g-string beneath it.&nbsp; Suddenly he really wished the drill didn&#8217;t have to happen NOW, of all times�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maria turned around, oblivious to the fact that Craig was momentarily lost, having been transfixed on the tiny string of her panties which disappeared down between the soft, tender cheeks of her ass.&nbsp; She had forgotten whatever intentions she&#8217;d had a few minutes earlier and was preoccupied with the long rope, uncoiling it a few feet at a time.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Ok, come over here and turn around, honey� Maria said, not even looking up at Craig, making an assumption that he would just do as she said.&nbsp; Craig walked over to her, watching as she pulled the rope into various lengths and doubled it over, not knowing what she was doing but remembering a few times when they were younger that she had tied him up for fun in her father&#8217;s boathouse.&nbsp; He had never been able to get away from her knots, which were always intricate and downright fancy in some cases.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a moment, the alarm and the stupid drill was forgotten and he was awash in sweet memories.&nbsp; Even though Maria was aloof, inconsiderate, and selfish, he loved her anyway and remembered a time before the war, before she began socializing with elitist snobs.&nbsp; Her jealous side had never presented itself to him then.&nbsp; After all, there were plenty of men around at the time, and Craig felt lucky that she had chosen him out of all the men she could have easily had.&nbsp; She was still so beautiful and sexy even though she had a very distorted and low view of herself, perhaps due to the fact that she could not bare children, and that she was now approaching 40.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally looking up into Craig&#8217;s face, Maria gave a quick, worried smile and pulled on his arm to let him know she wanted him to turn around.&nbsp; He sighed and did so, and soon felt Maria pulling her magic ropes around his wrists, which she had crossed behind him.&nbsp; Within a minute, Craig&#8217;s wrists were bound securely behind him.&nbsp; There was nothing particularly fancy about this tie.&nbsp; Maria had simply folded the rope at its center point, threaded the loose ends through the resulting loop, and wrapped the rope 4 times around his crossed wrists.&nbsp; She then ran the double rope around the center twice, threaded one end through the existing coils around his wrists, and tied the two ends together in the middle.&nbsp; At this point, Maria had two very long pieces remaining which hung down to the floor.&nbsp; These had caused some delay as she had been forced to pull these ends through several times as she worked.&nbsp; Maria had wanted to get his hands tied as quickly as possible to establish the fact that the couple was in compliance with the law 
so there would be no issues with the police if they arrived.&nbsp; Once she had his hands tied, she felt more at ease and was finally able to relax. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Alright, then� said Craig as he started to turn back towards Maria.&nbsp; �Wait just a minute� Maria instructed to her husband as she took a pair of scissors and cut the long ends of the rope off, letting them fall to the floor. She then stuffed the remaining two ends between the loops that encircled Craig&#8217;s wrists, tidying up the appearance of the bondage and simultaneously keeping the ends from being picked at by her prisoner&#8217;s fingers.&nbsp; Maria had used this simple tie many times on Craig back in the boathouse when they were younger.&nbsp; He had never managed to get loose, even when she gave him lots of time to work at it.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eyeing the rope laying in the floor, a thought struck Maria.&nbsp; She bent down to pick up one of the pieces, holding Craig&#8217;s tied hands in her left hand. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Ok where should I kneel in the floor, do you think?� Craig began to walk toward the front door.&nbsp; Maria held his hands and pulled back lightly.&nbsp; �Wait.&nbsp; Just wait a sec, hon..� Maria stated.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She began to wrap loops in the doubled piece of rope, three of them, and held them up to Dale&#8217;s shoulders.&nbsp; Not seeing what she was doing, Craig stood there for a minute.&nbsp; Maybe she had an adjustment to make, he thought, becoming mildly impatient.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Maria was finished with his wrists.&nbsp; At this point, she thought it might make a better presentation to the police or anyone at the safe haven if she put a little something extra.&nbsp; Maria decided to outdo any of her neighborhood competition should a trip have to be made.&nbsp; Oh how her friends would marvel at her skill and expertise�.what an opportunity to show them all how talented she was!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using a doubled rope and creating a triskelion knot, Maria left two ends very long, throwing each of them over Craig&#8217;s shoulders, then crossed them over at his chest and brought them back under his armpits to the elaborate knot.&nbsp; Wrapping these ends through opposite sides of the bottom loop, Maria then pulled these ends out to each side and proceeded to wrap the ends around Craig&#8217;s elbows.&nbsp; She had never used such a knot on Craig, and never tied his elbows before.&nbsp; Neither of them knew what to expect as she pulled the doubled ropes tight.&nbsp; Craig&#8217;s elbows came together slightly before he vocalized any discomfort.&nbsp; With plenty of rope remaining, she pulled each end over to the opposite elbow and made another loop through, again pulling it snug.&nbsp; At this point, Craig&#8217;s chest was jutting outward and he was giggling, thinking that Maria was just messing with him.&nbsp; But he had not seen the centerpiece of Maria&#8217;s elbow tie, and had no idea that she was making it more permanent.&nbsp; �Ok&nbsp; ok, you can knock it off now� Craig stated, still mildly amused at Maria&#8217;s apparent playfulness.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Just a couple more minutes, baby� Maria said as Craig started to try to pull away.&nbsp; As a result of his sudden pulling, the ropes she was holding around his elbows suddenly tightened a bit more, and she used the opportunity to put the still-long ends once more through the loops on the triskelion knot.&nbsp; Once the doubled ends of the rope were through the knot, it was easier to hold the tension.&nbsp; As she worked, Craig was becoming mildly annoyed.&nbsp; �Stop fooling around, let&#8217;s get this over with so we can go to bed�.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Baby, I&#8217;m thinking I need to do a really extra-good job in case the police show up, don&#8217;t you agree?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �No, not really.&nbsp; My elbows are hurting.&nbsp; It&#8217;s too tight.&nbsp; Come on, let&#8217;s get over by the door until the drill is over.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Just take deep breaths, baby.&nbsp; Stop talking and it will be easier to breathe, alright?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this time, Maria had already begun work to use the remaining rope to drop a double zigzag braid down from the center triskelion to the ropes binding Craig&#8217;s wrists.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m almost finished� Maria stated as she sensed Craig was about to say something else.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within another two minutes or less, Maria had braided a zigzag all the way to her husband&#8217;s wrists and tied the ends around the ropes binding them, further immobilizing him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �All done, baby�.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Craig tugged at his uncomfortable bondage for a few seconds, testing it out, realizing that there would be absolutely no getting free of it.&nbsp; His elbows were beginning to ache, but he could not budge the rope that was tied around them.&nbsp; From behind, Maria was admiring her work and just knew that if they had to go out in public, her husband&#8217;s bondage would be the envy of the neighborhood.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly a loud rapping on the door broke the silence, and Maria grabbed Craig by his right elbow and walked him hurriedly to the foyer area.&nbsp; She helped him to kneel down on the floor, facing the wall.&nbsp; She started to reach to unlock the door, then remembered something�She leaned back down and picked up one of Craig&#8217;s legs by the ankle, crossing it over the other one.&nbsp; This was the proper suggested position for all males during the first stage of a R.E.P.A.R.E. drill.&nbsp; Saying loudly at the door �Just a minute please�, Maria ran back into the living room, grabbed the remaining length of rope in the floor, and dashed back into the front hallway where Craig was.&nbsp; Quickly doubling the 10 meter length, she bent down behind Craig and worked with expert speed and skill to rope his feet together in basically the identical style she had used on his hands.&nbsp; Another loud knock on the door caused her to nervously wring her hands as she still had about a half-meter left.&nbsp; Quickly, she pulled the remaining rope up through Dale&#8217;s wrist bondage and tied it off right there, pulling it snug so there was only a few centimeters of length between his hands and his feet.&nbsp; Craig was nervous about the knocking as well and turned his head around to Maria as if to suggest to her that she answer the door, never minding the fact that she had just placed him into a sitting hog-tie, a position not required by law and one that would have to be removed if he was to be mobilized.&nbsp; Finally, satisfied that everything was in order, Maria unlocked the door and opened it.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two policewomen stood on the porch, one of which had responded to the house over a year before when the neighbor lady called in the report of a non-restrained male.&nbsp;&nbsp; Martha Culpepper was her name, and she was somewhat surprised to see Maria standing there, nearly naked.&nbsp; The look on her faced caused Maria to suddenly realize that she was all but undressed, and she instinctively covered her breasts which were clearly visible under the thin material.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t worry, Martha told Maria, holding her hand up.&nbsp; I realize we caught you near bedtime.&nbsp; It could happen to anyone.&nbsp; May I step inside for a moment?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maria nodded and muttered that she could, although Martha could not hear exactly what she said.&nbsp; Maria was clearly quite embarrassed by her fashion faux pas. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martha stepped in, turning her attention to the well-tied man sitting on his knees in the foyer.&nbsp; Immediately she noticed the intricate rope work and uttered a �Wow, come look at this Cindy� to her partner outside. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cindy hurried up the steps, having been looking up and down the street for any wayward males that may have been walking around in need of restraint.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Well, looks like you went from one extreme to the other since last year, didn&#8217;t you?� Martha looked back at Maria, then around to her partner, whos jaw was almost hanging open at the site of Craig on the floor trapped in the expertly-applied bondage.&nbsp; �Can you believe these two were arrested last year for non-compliance?�&nbsp; Now look at them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cindy shifted her attention to Maria, not believing the slightly-built woman was responsible for the craftsmanship at her knees.&nbsp; Maria gave a slight grin and shrugged a bit, not really knowing what to say, but secretly reveling in the praise for her handiwork.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �You know, if given rope to work with, I don&#8217;t think we could have done it better ourselves.� Martha stated.&nbsp; Although all police, military, and private security personnel were thoroughly trained in advanced forms of restraint, tying fancy, decorative knots was not part of their required curriculum.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �All he&#8217;d require at this point is a gag and a hood to be considered fully-restrained� chimed Cindy, kneeling down behind Craig and running her hands across the various knots.&nbsp; �Let&#8217;s see, is that right?&nbsp; You have wrists, ankles, no waist but you do have a chest harness instead.&nbsp; Plus, you have the connector rope here between his hands and feet.&nbsp; Not to mention a few other measures such as the elbows that connect to the wrists..Yes, I&#8217;d say this qualifies as full restraint plus if you only had the gag and hood.&nbsp; Very nice.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martha stated �It&#8217;s more than is required which is what we like to see.&nbsp; If this weren&#8217;t a drill, he would be able to present absolutely no problems at this level, and the police would be able to focus their attention better on the non-compliant ones.&nbsp; Personally, I&#8217;m hoping that the R.E.P.A.R.E. drills will soon require this level of participation�.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Craig had grown weary of this particular conversation long before it even started, but bit his tongue to keep from prolonging the visit by the cops.&nbsp; Hopefully they would soon leave and he could get upstairs with Maria to bone her.&nbsp; Seeing her in the short transparent gown and tiny string panties had made him quite horny.&nbsp; Not to mention, he felt a strange sense about her tonight with the cops here.&nbsp; For some reason, he had strange feelings that he was protected by her.&nbsp; Very odd indeed, given Maria&#8217;s tendencies toward self-gratification.&nbsp; Still, on his knees bound hand and foot by her, he had a definite feeling of being cared for that he failed to understand.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cindy broke his train of thought as she withdrew the &#8216;missing items&#8217; from compartments on her duty belt. A ball gag in one hand, and a dark-colored cloth sack in the other.&nbsp; She held the items up to Maria who took one at a time in her hands and examined them.&nbsp; �These are the two items you would need to complete a full restraint system on your husband.&nbsp; They are easy to apply and don&#8217;t take long.&nbsp; Would you like me to show you while we are here and have him to model for us?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maria looked at the items, then looked down at Craig, who was looking at her, pleading with his eyes not to use him as a training dummy, even though that is practically what he had been relegated to this evening.&nbsp; The women spoke about him as if he could not hear them, much like they would a helpless baby in a crib.&nbsp; Maria politely declined, �That&#8217;s ok, I think they look simple enough to use, and my husband has a dreadful toothache tonight.&nbsp; He is due to see the dentist tomorrow.�&nbsp; Craig could not believe Martha just lied so easily to the police, but was glad she did.&nbsp; The officer shrugged and replaced the items into their rightful pouches on her belt.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at Maria, Martha smiled.&nbsp; As she did, she noticed a chair in the living room behind her and asked about it, wondering if it was new.&nbsp; She said she did not remember it from last year, and asked if it was considered Danish modern in design.&nbsp; �Oh, yes, it is� Maria turned around and held her hand out to usher the officers into the living room, then spent the next 15 or 20 minutes chatting about decorating ideas and furniture styles, much to Craig&#8217;s dismay.&nbsp; He was quite uncomfortable at this point, but very glad that he did not have to endure the gag or the hood.&nbsp; At least he could see what was going on, and though it pained him, decided to keep his mouth shut.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martha mentioned to Maria that what had happened the year before was unfortunate, that she regretted having had to arrest her,&nbsp; but that she seemed to have taken control of the situation since and made a change for the better.&nbsp; Maria agreed with all she said, even going so far as to proclaim what a good idea the drills were and that they promoted a close sense of community in the neighborhood.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �What a load of shit� Craig thought as Maria hobnobbed with the officers.&nbsp; Finally, a call came in on their radios.&nbsp; Apparently, there was a report of drunk and disorderly male a few blocks away that had refused to participate in the R.E.P.A.R.E. drill.&nbsp; His wife and her friends had the poor man pinned down in the corner of a bedroom but had been unsuccessful thus far in getting any restraints placed on him.&nbsp; Hurriedly, the officers left, closing the front door behind them.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second alarm had not been sounded that night, so Maria&#8217;s ideas of showing off her rope skills to the neighbors was dashed.&nbsp; But she would get her chance next time, she hoped.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maria walked over to Craig, bent down, and untied the rope connecting his hands to his ankles.&nbsp; This allowed Craig to bend forward a bit more, relieving some pressure on his poor body.&nbsp; She then tended to his ankles, and helped him to stand.&nbsp; �Come on baby� she said, and led him back into the living room.&nbsp; Craig had slowly become furious and was about to explode by the time the cops left.&nbsp; Feeling his nerves regain their sensitivity and his blood regain an even flow throughout his body once more, Craig felt more empowered and began to address Maria&#8217;s apparent lack of respect for his situation, citing the extended conversations with police, not to mention her overzealous ropework.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maria, who had been preparing to undo Craig&#8217;s wrists and elbows, stopped what she was doing and, leaving him tightly bound, spun him around with all her force, almost causing him to trip.&nbsp; As he regained balance, he could see the �new� Maria in all her glory.&nbsp; The self-righteous, pompous, and arrogant Maria that he never knew until the past few years. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �You are lucky I didn&#8217;t let that woman demonstrate the gag and hood, Craig.&nbsp; I was trying to get on their good side so perhaps they will not pay us any more visits.&nbsp; Did you ever stop and think about that, or are you just in the mood to give me a hard time?�&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, she pushed Craig back and down onto the sofa as forcibly as she could, surprising him with her strength.&nbsp; He figured all her trips to the spa and gym were paying off.&nbsp; At least some of his money hadn&#8217;t gone to waste.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Your problem is, honey, that you don&#8217;t appreciate all that I do for you.&nbsp; You dwell on the negative things and never acknowledge the positive.&nbsp; Do I not keep a beautiful home?&nbsp; Do I not make you proud when we go out?&nbsp; What is it?&nbsp; Are you mad at me because I can&#8217;t have children?&nbsp; Is that it?� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �No, baby, no, of course not.&nbsp; I know that isn&#8217;t your fault.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve discussed that before.&nbsp; You know I love you and do not feel that way at all.&nbsp; Please, let&#8217;s just forget about tonight, go to bed, and start over tomorrow.&nbsp; Can we?&nbsp; I&#8217;m very sorry I got upset.&nbsp; Cops always make me nervous and I didn&#8217;t think when I complained about you wanting to befriend them.&nbsp; Maybe it&#8217;s a good idea after all.�&nbsp; Craig was still a bit angry, but decided the best course of action was appeasement, given that Maria was standing in front of him between his knees, arms crossed in front of her.&nbsp; He, on the other hand, was half-laying on his bound elbows and hands, and had no chance of getting free without her help.&nbsp; Maria, still wearing only her nightie and skimpy string, looked strangely sexy even though her eyes were throwing daggers at him.&nbsp; He did not understand it, but despite his anger, something was making him extremely horny.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maria looked down to see Craig&#8217;s erection creating a bulge in the soft satin boxer shorts which shimmered in the light of the Tiffany lamp beside the sofa.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her brow unfurled and her face softened almost instantly.&nbsp; With a devlish grin, Maria knelt down where she stood, then reached up to Craig&#8217;s waistband.&nbsp; Motioning with her hand for Craig to raise his ass from the sofa cushion, she pulled the boxers down all the way to his ankles.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Craig had endured the ropes binding his elbows and wrists for nearly a half-hour at this point, he suddenly found himself not so worried about it. The second he felt Maria&#8217;s breath on his stiff cock, his eyes rolled back into his head and nothing else mattered.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maria began to kiss Craig between his thighs, above and all around his cock, but was careful only to breathe warm air onto it, teasing him.&nbsp; As she did so, she felt Craig attempting to squirm and thrust his cock toward her face.&nbsp; That resulted in a playful slap to his thighs, and he sat back down into the soft cushion.&nbsp; He wanted so much to shove his cock into Maria&#8217;s mouth, but he knew she had him at her mercy, and would do that only when she was ready, not before.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Craig was writhing in a fit of delicious torment, oblivious to anything else, when Maria suddenly grabbed his stiff member and put just the head of it into her mouth.&nbsp; She bit down lightly, introducing a new sensation to the experience.&nbsp; Holding the end of his swollen cock in her teeth, she moved her head around and pulled on it slightly.&nbsp; Craig squirmed in a brief sensation of panic, but Maria held his thighs and hips inside her forearms, steadying him somewhat.&nbsp; His boxers were bunched up around his ankles and kept his feet from moving apart too much.&nbsp; So thoroughly tied at his back, Maria demonstrated almost total control of him, and right now, that was just fine.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After having playfully bitten Craig&#8217;s small head, Maria now thrust the entire six-inch length of his cock all the way back into her mouth, down her throat.&nbsp; He knew she had a marvelous talent for this and had enjoyed her more erotic skillsets now for almost two decades.&nbsp; Back and forth Maria moved her head, applying just the right amount of pressure to stimulate all areas of Craig&#8217;s cock at once.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After only a few minutes of this, Craig&#8217;s cock was ready to explode and his breathing quickened as he neared a massive orgasm.&nbsp; Just when he thought he might explode, Maria pulled up and off of him, leaving his hard cock twitching in anticipation.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Just one sec� she said as she darted into the hallway and up the stairs, leaving Craig totally frustrated on the sofa.&nbsp; Within a half-minute, Maria had returned to Craig, holding a flexible rubber ring in her hand.&nbsp; Craig was still as she knelt down between his legs once more to apply the cock ring.&nbsp; �You won&#8217;t be getting off that easy tonight, Mister� Maria jokingly said as she bent down, pulled Craig&#8217;s feet onto the sofa, then reverse-straddled him.&nbsp; She purposefully bent over a bit to give Craig a splendid rear view of her ass and clean-shaven pussy, which was still covered by the thin patch of material that composed what there was of her panties.&nbsp; She was close enough to Craig for him to notice that the little patch of material looked to be soaked, and he was almost sure he saw some of Maria&#8217;s juices flowing down the inside of her thigh.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving the thin strip of material to the side, Maria took Craig&#8217;s cock, now kept extra-hard by the rubber ring, and guided it into her wet slit, impaling herself on him.&nbsp; She began to raise and lower herself slowly, deliberately, at her own pace.&nbsp; Craig was in such a position that it was difficult to get leverage, but did what he could to thrust his hips into her as she moved.&nbsp; Maria began to moan softly as she rode her husband.&nbsp; She bent forward and held his knees in her hands as she ground herself on him.&nbsp; At one point, she reached out and took a pillow from the other side of the sofa.&nbsp; Looking behind her and down, she told Craig to lift his ass once again as she stuffed the pillow under his hips, keeping them elevated so she could shorten her strokes somewhat.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She began to grind harder and faster.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Craig just sat back and enjoyed the entire affair, unable to really contribute to the scene but not upset in the least how it was playing out.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maria began panting like a wild animal as she rode herself to a frantic orgasm on Craig&#8217;s immobilized and helpless body.&nbsp; As she began to make more and more noise, Craig soon found himself having an uncontrollable orgasm of his own.&nbsp; The cock ring kept him erect, however, and Maria continued to ride through another 3, maybe 4 orgasms by Craig&#8217;s count.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After exhausting herself, she slumped forward toward Craig&#8217;s feet.&nbsp; �Mmmmmmmm that was very, very nice� she looked back over her shoulder into Craig&#8217;s eyes as she rubbed up and down on his shins with her hands.&nbsp; The two of them continued to lay there another few minutes, allowing their breathing to return to normal and their pulses to normalize.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Maria had rested enough, she jumped up in typical selfish fashion, ran upstairs, and after removing her drenched g-string and gown, stepped into a warm shower.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Craig laid there for a moment, awaiting Maria&#8217;s return.&nbsp; Perhaps she was, after all, possible to reason with.&nbsp; �Maybe she isn&#8217;t as self-centered and uncaring as I think� he thought to himself.&nbsp; Then he heard the water running and realized that indeed, Maria had totally forgotten that her husbands arms had been expertly bound now for nearly one and a half hours.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Craig worked to pull himself up off the couch.&nbsp; With freed feet and legs, he was able to make it up the steps, down the hallway and into the bedroom.&nbsp; He stepped into the bathroom where Maria was lathering herself up with a bar of ridiculously expensive soap.&nbsp; Poking his head behind the curtain, he found himself staring at her curvaceous backside, all wet and soapy.&nbsp; �Uh, honey, could I get you to do me one favor� he asked politely with a grin.&nbsp; Maria turned around and noticed her doubled ropes still crossing over in front of his chest.&nbsp; Her eyes widened and one hand went to her mouth.&nbsp; �Oh, I am sooo sorry, baby.&nbsp; Here, come in here and turn around, I&#8217;ll take care of that this instant.�&nbsp; Dale stepped into the warm shower with his wife, turned facing away from her, and stood still as she methodically untied the ropes.&nbsp; As she worked, Craig looked down and noticed he still had a raging hard-on, kept alive by the constrictive, yet comfortable ring around the base of his penis.&nbsp; He hoped to use it again when they got to bed�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last thing Maria untied was Craig&#8217;s hands, which made him wonder if she had some subconscious desire to keep him under her control as long as possible.&nbsp; After all, she could have had them untied far quicker than most of the rest of the intricate bondage.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the shower, the couple retired to bed where Craig managed to convince Maria to engage in another round of more vanilla sex, the type they usually had, before rolling over to go to sleep.&nbsp; The two of them slept very well that night, having turned a potentially frustrating, negatively-charged situation into a night of passion and ultimately, fulfillment for the both of them.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night and Craig&#8217;s bed and living room sofa seemed long ago and far away as Craig neared the end of his march.&nbsp; His short-strided walk had begun at the train car, continued up the escalators, then out into the street, up the sidewalk and ended out on the street next to a large panel van, more commonly known as a paddy wagon. With each step Craig had taken, he had felt less like an individual and more like a piece of livestock being led to the slaughter.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the trio stopped behind the panel van, Craig could hear what sounded like keys being rattled, put into a lock, and then a large door being raised.&nbsp; Although he was wearing the sack over his head, he could picture the paddy wagon in his mind.&nbsp; He had ridden in one only once, when he and Maria had been arrested for non-compliance.&nbsp; That was before the widespread emphasis had been placed on ultra-high security and redundant prisoner restraints, and all he had worn in the paddy wagon that night was handcuffs behind his back, with a connector chain attached to the metal bench inside.&nbsp; On the other hand, Maria had only been made to wear hers in front, and not connected to anything. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, Craig had heard rumors about the paddy wagons.&nbsp; The general rumor was that transport restraint measures had become far more significant in the past couple of years.&nbsp; With the devices Craig had been fitted with in the train car, he could already sense that the rumors were not unfounded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Craig wondered how long it would be before he would sleep in his own bed again.&nbsp; He worried about the restaurant and his beloved group of girls there.&nbsp; He wondered how or if they would be able to deal with Maria running things.&nbsp; Speaking of Maria, he could think of nobody else that would have had opportunity to put that gun in his briefcase.&nbsp; What had she done?&nbsp; What was going to happen to them now?&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he stood pondering his fate, officers readied the paddy wagon for their new arrival.
