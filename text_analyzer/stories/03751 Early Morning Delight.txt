Synopsis: She is being beligerent to her Master, but that attitude won't get her very far.Early Morning Delight 
by Ms. Madison 
(After a few attempts, I am rather proud of this story. I'd say this one was
  truly inspired, as none of the ones I've written in the past have been as easy,
  steamy, and fulfilling. 
Please send me your comments. Enjoy!) 
------------------------------------------------------------- 
He touches my face, rubs his fingers over my lips. He feels my teeth. My hands
  are caught above my head � I try to pull down again, but can't get free. He
  chuckles over watching me struggle and moves over to torture my ear, nibbling
  licking then biting� it hurts� and the pain shoots down into my belly and my
  clit. I feel a warmth spreading to my chest. I know I'm blushing a bright shade
  of red which only seems to amuse him all the more. 
�Oooh, baby� he growls in my ear, �you're so helpless.� 
All I can do is whimper� trying to stifle the sound to save my pride. He licks
  down my neck holding my face pressed to my left arm. I know he's leaving marks
  on the sensitive skin with his lips ripping at me, his teeth teasing my skin.
  I feel like I can't breath. I'm so scared and so horny� it doesn't make any
  sense in my head. I feel the breeze from the open window cooling my neck, the
  wetness cooling me even as his mouth is turning me into a twisting burning
  flint. 
He pulls the sheet away from my body and he looks down at my breasts. �So
  pretty.� 
I struggle again trying to pull my arms down� but I can't. I open my mouth
  to give him some attitude but his hand covers my lips before I get a word out. 
All I can do is breathe through my nose as he tugs and throws the sheet off
  of me to the floor. I know I should be silent, that's the challenge he's given
  me. So I just try to catch my breath as he moves lower on my body, holding
  my legs together, squeezing my hips in his hands. He bites my thighs softly,
  his teeth feel like electric shocks that ricochet into my pussy� there's fireworks. 
He's licking the top of my pussy and I shift to move my legs apart but he
  won't let me. Holding my legs tightly together, my thighs squeezed shut, he
  licks at my pussy� pulls at the hairs, sticks his tongue further and further
  into my slick folds. I'm trembling and my belly clenches painfully from the
  excitement, the frustration of it. I'm raising my hips up off the bed to bring
  my clit closer to his tongue. He pulls away. 
I can't help moaning� The sound is crude and ragged, hanging in the air. 
�You're so excited.� He points out, his breath hot against my belly. �What
  a naughty naughty girl.� 
I try to mutter something to deny his cocky attitude. If it was him tied up
  and me going down on him � he'd be fucking screaming. I feel hot and angry,
  and frustrated that he won't give me the release my body's begging for until
  he's through with his little games. And how am I supposed to keep quiet anyhow
  when his hands are gripping and his mouth playing on me? 
�Not that excited�� came out sounding not-quite-as-bored as I'd hoped. I suck
  in some quick breaths that betray my little outburst as a lie. His eyes narrow
  as he stares up at my face. I'm biting my lip� which is maybe what I should've
  done a few seconds earlier. 
Tension ripples in the silence and I watch as he moves away. That's right � let
  him feel hurt� upset� whatever. I don't care. I'm just tied up here� oh shit.
  And my pussy is still pounding, an obvious reminder of how stupid I was acting. 
Blue balls might feel bad, but an unsatisfied crotch is not picnic either� it
  aches and clenches against itself, the emptiness taunting� 
�I'm sorry, baby�� is all I can softly whisper. I really try to sound as sweet
  and contrite as I can. I want to rub my thighs together to release some of
  the tension, but I stop myself. I open my legs a little, showing myself to
  him� how wet I am� the pink folds glisten in the early morning light. I want
  his hands touching me, his fingers sliding up inside flicking at my g-spot,
  stretching me, fucking me. God, I want him so bad! 
�Sorry what?� 
My voice drops and I feel like I'm speaking from my center, �I'm sorry, Master�.
  Something about using that word �Master� makes me feel like I've given up control
  to him. Makes me feel super vulnerable, like I'm caught in a web� this power
  play between us. I'm calling him on the primal level of energy and love and
  life. I need him the same way he needs me � and its been this way from the
  beginning of time. 
�I think you need to be punished, babe. I think you ass should be burning.� says
  Master. I'd like that. 
I don't say anything. Really, pain isn't my favorite thing. I'd rather have
  him climb on top of me and sink his cock slowly into my wetness. But at this
  point, it's a little late in the game for me to negotiate. 
�Ask for it.� He grabs hold of my hair. 
Ow! That fucking hurts. In my mind, I still debate asking for what I want,
  asking him to fuck me, and pissing him off even more. 
�Please� please spank me.� 
�How many, slut?� 
How many� how many?� I don't know. Why do I have to answer this one, my eyes
  ask him. I don't want to make decisions� You're the master, you decide � I
  frown. 
�Hey, I'm not fucking around!� he pinches my nipples and rolls them squeezing
  the tips of my breasts between his fingers. Oh, noooooooooo� My nipples are
  so sensitive. I'm moaning, there's a jumble of heat and confusion in my brain. 
�Thirty.� I breathe out. 
Damn� did I just say that?? Thirty?!!? 
What was I thinking� 
�Feeling brave?� - well at least he seems impressed. I think last time I had
  to beg him to stop at 25. Its silly but I take a little pride at my upping
  the ante, as he maneuvers me across his thighs. My breasts and belly scratch
  over his lap and I feel so naked, while he's wearing jeans and a shirt. His
  skin protected from my skin by the thin rough barrier. I start to shift a little
  to rub my pussy against his legs. 
Sternly he says �Stop.� 
You make sure to position me so that my feet can't touch the floor, while
  my hands are planted. My ass and pussy raised up high, I feel off my balance
  and scared� 
It seems as if he feels my discomfort and starts massaging my ass, squeezing
  the cheeks, rubbing � god, that feels so good! The muscles of my legs releasing
  and relaxing. He's pinching the soft flesh where my thighs meet my buttocks.
  I'm trying to stifle my gasps and whimper. He feels the wetness between my
  legs and massages my own slick over my pussy lips. Sliding his wet fingers
  down and over my clit, massaging it lightly. Feels like I'm caught in a hurricane
  and I'm groaning loudly. 
Without a warning, he pulls his hand away from my drenched pussy and start
  the spanking� The slaps hurt and seem to come in quick succession. I gulp at
  the air trying to hold my breath against the injustice and indignity. But at
  the same time, each slap is sending shocks of sexual heat into my face and
  my chest. 
I can't count and suddenly he stops. My bottom is throbbing, glowing with
  warmth. It feels itchy and naughty� the stinging - a feverish reminder of my
  kink. 
I feel him reach across my back over to the nightstand and take something� Then
  the sound of the cap popping off makes me twist a little to try to look back
  and see what's coming. I get another hard smack for that. Master rests his
  left hand on my lower back, his thumb between the folds of my ass cheeks, holding
  me in place. His other hand, fingers wet with lube are now sliding between
  my heated globes, pushing against the little puckered opening. Oh, noooo� There
  is a revolt in my head, but I can't move� just whimper softly. 
�Hold still.� His voice is rough, I can feel his rigid cock against my belly
  pushing through the jeans. His finger squeezes inside the forbidden hole, makes
  me feel so dirty� so naughty� 
�You're such a bad girl.� He scolds me, �You deserve this.� 
I moan in submission, �Yes, Master.� 
The lube and his hand, his fingers stretching me, thrusting in and out of
  my ass slowly� I'm crying, so ashamed and excited at the same time. How does
  he do this to me? Its so uncomfortable, and my ass clenching around his fingers
  makes it all the more real. He's finger fucking my ass slowly and methodically
  sliding two fingers in and out. My body is breaking out in a sweat at the sensation. 
�Are you really sorry now, slut?� he asks me. 
�I'm� I'm really sorry�� stumbling over my words. �I'm really sorry, Master.� It
  feels like some form of exquisite torture to speak to him while his fingers
  are ravaging my ass, and my pussy is dripping juices down the insides of my
  legs. 
�Good.� He growls, and I almost tumble onto the floor as he stands up, lifting
  me by my hips. 
He positions me on the bed on my hands and knees. I arch my back in invitation,
  with the sounds of buttons popping and zipper getting pulled down behind me.
  Finally, I feel your skin against me. Your delicious cock nudging against me
  and I'm rubbing my pussy over your cock, seducing the head into the folds below
  my ass cheeks. It feels so wet and hot and unbearably empty as I grind my pussy
  onto your cock and finally you reach down and guide the bulbous tip into my
  slit. I'm moaning at the sensation of your tool sliding into me, it feels helpless
  and so so wet. My pussy clenches around your shaft and I feel myself about
  to come from this first thrust. 
I'm moaning, �Ooooh, can I come, Master?� 
He pulls out and thrusts again slowly, its almost too much to bear� My fingers
  are clenching the sheets and my back in a painful arch to bring him deeper
  inside. 
�Ask again, slut�� 
�Please�� I'm panting now, �Please� can I come now, Master?� My pussy clenches
  at his cock in supplication for release. 
�Come for me, baby�� His words so sweet, as he slams into me, tipping me over
  into my orgasm. And I'm screaming as I pound my hips back into him. And I can't
  stop, my body is convulsing. I keep screaming, �Oh, God�� Oh, God! And it seems
  to go on and on, my body relishing in this release. 
His hands dig into the sides of my hips and I hear him suck in a quick breath
  before pushing into me, and pounding, and coming� He's moaning loudly, and
  his pleasure makes me come again. We're so loud in our ecstasy, the thought
  races through my brain before being obliterated in a white-hot explosion. It
  feels like I'm passing out from these waves of coming and coming. 
We collapse on the bed breathing hard,
