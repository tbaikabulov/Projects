The New Slave

&nbsp;

Putting down my paintbrush, I looked at the
clock and saw I had only ten minutes until Master William would arrive.� I covered up the painting and put the brushes
away, thinking all the time about the strange direction my life had taken over
the last two years.� By the time I had
put away my paints and put on the handcuffs Master William insisted I wear each
time he visited, it was almost time. I felt the rush of fear I always felt
before he arrived and worst still, the helpless feeling I hated so much. He had
me in a trap and there was no way I could think of to get out of it, at least
not without causing some people I loved pain. I took a deep breath and knelt
down on the floor, remembering the first time I had knelt before him.

&nbsp;

Two years earlier.

&nbsp;

As I looked around the room, I could see
two naked girls preparing food in the kitchen and in the other room behind me I
knew there were more girls cleaning.�� I
tried to get my hands loose from behind my back, but like the last dozen times,
they stayed tightly bound.� I was
kneeling on a cushion, which at least made it a bit more comfortable then the
conditions I had been held in previously. The sound of a door shutting and
footsteps made all the girls squeal excitedly and run to kneel beside me on the
floor.� 

&nbsp;

There were five altogether and by the time
I could hear the footsteps enter the room, they had all put their hands behind
their head and had spread their knees so their private parts were on show.� I seemed to be the only one scared witless
and if it wasn�t for the gag I had been made to wear,
I would have been screaming for help. I tried to sit quietly but I could not
help but whimper in fear.� One of the
girls beside me touched her knee to mine and though it gave me some comfort, it
didn�t ease my fear any.� 

&nbsp;

She kept it there as the man moved around
and spoke quietly to each girl, the sound of their hushed whispers confusing
me.� Maybe this was someone else and not
their master, but why would they act like they had if he wasn�t the master.� My heart stopped as his shoes stopped in
front of me and a hand raised my chin to look at him. 

He was not hurting me but I could feel a
certain amount of pressure there too.�
�Who is this lovely creature? Slave Gina, can you fill me in on why she
is here?� I wanted to pull away from him, but even in his gentle grip there was
no give.� 

&nbsp;

�Master, she arrived this morning with that
card that is sitting on the bench behind her.��
He let go of my chin and went to read the card.� I began to shake, not knowing what he would
find out about me and how he would react.�
When he simply put the card down and smiled, I started to relax, but
then he sent the other girls except the one he had talked to about me away.� My fear returned as he pulled me up to my
feet and again lifted my chin so I had to look at him.� I was so scared I couldn�t help the tears
that started to run down my cheeks and flinched when he brought his hand up to
wipe them away.� 

&nbsp;

Despite the fact he had done nothing to
hurt me yet, I was sure it was only a matter of time before he did.� �Gina, take our new guest into my room and
I�ll be there soon.�� His room!� I just wanted to get out of there and the
last place I wanted was to be was in his room. �Love, don�t worry, it is not as
bad as it seems. Come on, be a good girl and don�t make me drag you.��� She seemed nice and I found my fear
lessening a bit as I let her lead me through the house to a large room with a
big bed and a large leather couch.� I
didn�t have any more time to look around as his footsteps entered the room
behind me.� �Gina I��

&nbsp;

Surprised as he stopped mid-sentence, I
felt his fingers gently touch my very sore bottom.� Even though he was trying not to hurt me, I
couldn�t help but moan as he turned me around to face him. I heard a gasp
behind me as Gina saw my bottom for the first time too.� �Gina, go and get that ointment on the top
shelf and a couple of painkillers.� I was then gently taken over to a large,
soft looking cushion. �Can you sit or would you rather kneel?� Though my knees
were sore from kneeling all morning, I knew I wasn�t able to sit yet.� �Kneel Master.�
Again his hand came to stroke my face, but I still flinched in fear that it
would bring me pain.� By the time I had
slowly settled down on the cushion, Gina was back with the ointment.� He took it and moved around behind me while
Gina knelt down in front of me and allowed me to lean on her shoulder while the
ointment was rubbed in. It hurt, despite the fact he was being very gentle and
I could feel my tears wetting Gina�s shoulder.��
Her hand rubbed my back, something that reminded me of being comforted
by my mother and this just made me cry even more.� I panicked as the gag was pulled back into my
mouth but then I realised he was pulling it back to undo it, and I sighed as I
moved my jaw to ease the ache there.� 

&nbsp;

While I cried softly, they both moved away
and talked quietly for a moment, before Gina left the room.� He came back and pulled up a cushion and sat
down in front of me.� I had gingerly
tried to lower my bottom onto my calves, but it still hurt too much.� Gina came back into the room with a glass of
water and what looked to be a life preserver from a boat.� However, it felt like heaven when he placed
it on my calves and I was able to rest my bottom on it, the ring in the middle
meaning I wasn�t putting all my weight onto my bottom.� He then had me take two tablets and sat back
and looked at me.

&nbsp;

His gaze made me feel nervous and I tried
again to get my hands free.� I hated the
helplessness I felt and just wanted to feel free again.� �Shh Slave, you are
in no danger here.� Now, calm down and
tell me your name.�� I could only stare
at him. How could he call me slave and then tell me I was in no danger?� No matter how kind he was being now, I just
knew that he would be as evil as the man who had hurt me and then just gave me
away. However, having no wish to upset him, I focused on what he had asked me.
�My name is Jill. Please let me go home, I won�t say anything, please!�� I hadn�t meant to beg, but it just came out.� 

&nbsp;

The expected anger at my outburst didn�t
come; instead I could only see pity in his eyes.� He reached out and this time stroked my hair,
though I still flinched. �Jill, I am sorry but that is something that will not happen.
Your old life is gone and you can never return to it.�� The factual way he dismissed my old life just
made be cry again, thinking of all the people I would never see again.� I felt a soft hand on my shoulder and again
felt my head being lowered onto Gina�s shoulder.� This time she pulled me even closer and I
could feel her breasts rubbing against mine.�
The shock caused me to pull back and I looked to see a hurt look briefly
cross her face before she smiled gently at me.�


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

My emotions were all over the place and I
just didn�t know what to think.� I had
not meant to hurt Gina�s feelings but the feel of her breasts on mine just felt
so wrong and the way he was looking at me just confused me even more. �Jill,
I�m sorry to be so blunt but it is best you know the truth. From now on you are
my slave and will refer to me as Master William or just Master.� Tell me you understand slave.�� �Yes Master.��
I so wanted to beg him over and over to let me go, but as he was being
so nice I didn�t want to risk making him change. He seemed to relax a bit at my
answer but then a look I couldn�t read crossed his face.

&nbsp;

�I need you to tell me about what happened
to your bottom.� I assume Master Tony did
it but it is important I know why.�� At
the sound of Master Tony�s name, I began to shiver and Gina put one arm around
my shoulder and squeezed gently. This time I didn�t pull away, her support
giving me the strength I needed to tell him about what Master Tony had
done.� �Master, I ..he..sorry
but I don�t know where to start.�� Master
William didn�t seem upset by my stumbled answer. �Slave, I understand how it
could be hard to tell me something that could be personal but I need to
know.� How about if I ask you some
questions, would that help?�� I nodded,
happy to let him help me.� �First, how
long were you with Master Tony?�� 

&nbsp;

�Um, I think it was about a week but I�m
not exactly sure.� He seemed a bit surprised by this but did not pause in his
questioning. �Ok, tell me how you happened to be with him.�� My mind immediately went back to the day I
was captured. �I was walking home from a late class, having just missed the
last bus.� I knew I should have gotten a
taxi, but wanted to save the money and after a full day of classes I needed to
clear my head.� I was thinking of the
work I had to do on my next assignment when someone grabbed me and pulled me
into a van.� I must have been injected
with something, as the next thing I remembered was waking up with a pounding
headache.� I paused to take a breath and was glad when the glass of water was
held up to my lips to have a drink. 

&nbsp;

�I didn�t know where I was but it looked to
be some kind of warehouse. I became aware of voices behind me and of how I was
securely tied and began to panic.� To cut
a long story short, it was in the warehouse that two men came and took me to
Master Tony�s house.�� He seemed to be
thinking about what I had said, which gave me a moment catch my breath.� �Ok, so what happened at Tony�s house.�� 

&nbsp;

�I didn�t see him for the first two or
three days, being kept in a small room.��
The only contact I had was when I would be taken out for a while each
day to be taught how to kneel or address this guy I was expected to call
Master. On the day I met Master Tony, I was made to strip and show him my body.
He was mean and made me do the most embarrassing things.� I gasped, realising
this new Master could make me do the same things, but he seemed too intent on
my story to show any reaction.� �Anyway,
eventually he led me into his room and pushed me onto his bed. I don�t know why
I did it, but before I knew it, I had brought my knee up as hard as I could
into his balls.� To put it mildly, he
didn�t like it and by the time he had recovered, the same men who had taken me
from the warehouse, had tied me down to the bed on my stomach.�

&nbsp;

The re-telling of the story made me feel
like I was reliving the whole thing and I had to take a few more deep breaths
to continue.� I was glad of the feeling
of Gina�s arm around me, making me feel like I wasn�t alone for the first time
since I had been taken.� �Slave, you are
doing very well, go on now and finish your story.�� I looked at this man, my new Master, and
began to see how different he was from Master Tony, at least for the present
moment. �The next part is a bit sketchy, as all I can remember is being hit on
my bottom over and over until I must have passed out. When I came to, I was in
so much pain. I had no idea how long I had been out for but Master Tony was
still really mad at me and told me he didn�t think he wanted to waste his time
on me. That is how I came to be here.�� 

&nbsp;

I couldn�t bring myself to look up, feeling
embarrassed by what I had told him. �Slave, look at me.� Master Tony is.. well, I�ll just say we don�t agree on many things.� What he thought was a waste of his time I
think will be time well spent.� Right now
you are not ready or able to understand all that I will expect of you, but in a
little while, when you have healed, we will begin your training. Gina, I am
putting you in charge of our new slave here and trust that you will do a good
job.�� I looked up at the change in his
tone and saw his hand grip Gina�s hair as he pulled her head back.� This other side of him scared me and when he
let Gina go and reached out to stroke my hair, I kept waiting for him to do the
same thing to me.� However, all he did
was stroke my hair and leave the room.��
Gina then stood me up gently and led me to what would be my new home.

Chapter 2

&nbsp;

For the next week, Gina looked after me and
my bottom began to heal.� I saw Master
William a few times over the week, but he only stayed long enough to make sure
I was healing alright.� When I saw him
again come into my room, I thought it would be one of the same flying visits I
had gotten used to, so I was surprised when he sat down on the end of the bed.
�Slave, kneel at my feet and be quick about it.�� All of a sudden I remembered why I was there
and felt my stomach flip with fear. I scrambled to kneel before him, my body
shaking. This time when he reached out, he did grip my hair and I had to pull
my head back or have my hair pulled out. It hurt and I could feel tears come to
my eyes. �Slave Jill, today you will start to know what being my slave is all
about.� Disobey me and you will feel pain
but try your best and you will be rewarded.� He let go of my hair and wiped
away the tears that were now on my face.

&nbsp;

Whether I liked it or not, I knew I had to
try to please him.� I didn�t feel that he
would react like Master Tony had, but I still had the sense that he wouldn�t
put up with any nonsense either.� �First,
I have been thinking all week about your beautiful body but now I don�t have to
just think about it.� Today, not only
will you begin to learn how to act as my slave but you will start to learn how
to please me with your body as well.��
This really scared me and he must have seen this, as he softened his
tone slightly. �Slave, don�t look so scared. I know this will not be easy for
you but it is want I want and you will be ok. I trust that my balls will be
safe?�� I looked up in surprise at his
words, but when I saw his smile I knew he was teasing me.� Again, I tried to work out this man who could
tell me I was going to be his sex slave one minute and crack a joke the next. 

&nbsp;

He pulled me to my feet and spun me around,
hooking his arm under my arms and pulling me back into his body. I could not
move away from him as he played with my breasts and then reached down to feel
my pussy.� Trying to squirm away, he just
hooked his feet around mine and I could not move at all. My breathing grew
short as his fingers tried to enter into my dry pussy. When he moved his finger
away from me, he leant down and whispered in my ear. �We will come back to that
later, baby.� I had no time to respond as he pushed me forward, grabbing my
wrists and tying them tightly.� 

&nbsp;

�Come with me, we have lost time to catch
up on.�� He gripped a nipple and began to
pull, making me powerless to resist him.�
I had to almost run to keep up with him as I was led down the hall to a
large room.� He let go of my nipple and I
sighed, at the same time I heard the door being shut and locked.� Spinning around to see what he was doing, I
took in the room for the first time.� On
the wall were all manner of whips and other things I knew were for use on his
slaves.� I was frozen to the spot and
even though I knew the door was locked and he was standing in front of it, all
I wanted to do was run.� �Look at me
slave, not at what is on the walls.� Yes,
over time you may get to experience many if not all of them, but I will only be
introducing you to some of them today.� I know he was trying to calm me down
but all he did was to confirm my worst fears.�
Not knowing how I was going to cope with all he had planned, I found
myself finding it hard to breath and my legs felt
weak. I started to feel strange and began looking for somewhere to sit
down.� Just as I started to think I might
faint, I found myself in his arms.� He
sat me down and leant me back against him.�
�Shh, take some deep breaths, that is right.� I tried to do what he said, just so I could get
my breath back. Gradually I began to calm down and was able to breath again, though my bigger problem was still there.� 



�Slave, has anything like that happened to
you before?�� The concern I heard in his
voice was so different from what I expected him to say, that I found myself
answering without thinking. �No Master.��
He pushed me to sit up on my own and moved so he could see my face.
�Tell me then why you reacted as you did.��
His stare was piercing as he waited for my answer.� �I am scared of what you will want me to do,
Master. I will try but please �� I couldn�t finish and just looked down waiting
for his response.� �Slave, I know you are
scared and I will try to talk you through what to expect but this is what I
want.� All of the other girls were scared
too at first, but they got used to it and so will you.�� I wondered if I would ever get used to being
a slave but felt some comfort in the fact that he seemed to be aware of my
fears. I saw his face grow serious again and knew I would now have to face up
to whatever he had planned �Ok, enough talking, lets get started.� 

&nbsp;

He pulled me up to my feet and moved me
over to stand near one wall and pulled my tied hands back to attach them to the
wall. I pulled and found I could not move away, as he went to get what looked
like a long stick. �Slave, this is called a spreader bar and today I will use
it to keep your legs spread.� He bent down and tied one ankle to the bar and
then made me stretch out my leg to attach it to the other end. My legs felt so
widely stretched I moaned as he attached it to rings in the floor. I could no
longer move in any way and started to feel my breath growing short again, however
this time I managed to control it before I had another attack.� Not thinking he had noticed, I was somehow
comforted when he stroked my hair back from my face. �Good girl, just keep
trying your best and I will be happy.�

&nbsp;

He would be happy!� I don�t know why but part of me was starting
to want to make him happy, though I am sure it was a touch of self-preservation
as well.� If he was happy, I would be
happy or at least that was what I hoped.�
He pulled a gag out of his pocket and I started to shake my head but he
took no notice. �Open up nice and wide for me.� I did and the ball was pushed
into my mouth. He pushed my head down and tightened the straps. �Good, try and
push it out for me.�� I did, not really
sure why. �I can see you are wondering why I am asked you to do that.� I want you to be able to feel the gag and for
it to block some sound but my intention in not to hinder your ability to
swallow.� If the ball is in too far or it
is too big, you will have serious trouble.��


&nbsp;

He then moved away again and all I could do
was watch as he picked up a familiar object. It was just like what Master Tony
had used to hurt me so badly, though it looked to be a bit smaller.� I tried to beg behind the gag but only
muffled sounds came out.� As he
approached me, I began to shake and tried to get free.� Master William again stroked my hair until I
had calmed a bit. �Slave, I assume by your reaction that this was what Master
Tony used on you, but there are many ways to use a flogger and even many
different types of floggers.� I am not
saying this will not hurt you but I promise you will not be injured.� I may like to play and have my slaves suffer
for me, but I will never harm you in any permanent or life threatening
way.� I know that right now you may not
believe me but you just have to learn to trust me.�� 

&nbsp;

While I was thinking I could never trust
someone who was happy to hold me as a slave when all I wanted to do was go
home, I heard and then felt the flogger hit my stomach.� It did sting but it was not like the agony I
had felt when Master Tony had hit me.�
After each strike, Master William would rub the spot where he had hit,
allowing me time to get used to the pain.�
After a while, the hits got a bit harder and he did not stop so
often.� I was almost reaching a point
where it was getting too much when he dropped the flogger onto the ground.� He moved close to me and ran his hands all
over my body and then again tried to push his finger in my pussy.� I gasped as he managed to get his finger in
part of the way, but still he could not get it all in. 

&nbsp;

He spit on his finger and tried again and
this time he got it in and began to pump in and out. I tensed, his finger
feeling too big.� He pulled out and I
sighed.� �Slave, you need to relax and
let me get you ready for me or it will hurt more than it has to.�� I knew he was right but the thought of just
letting him do whatever he wanted without resistance still seemed wrong.� He left again and came back with something in
his hand, which he pushed against my clit and turned on.� I had used a vibrator before, but it did not
feel like this one did.� He used his
finger to push into me again and with the vibrator causing a sensation I could
not control, I was helpless to stop his finger or the orgasm I could feel
building.� 

&nbsp;

He was relentless and just kept the
vibrator on my clit until I could hold off no longer and my orgasm rocked
through me. It was a strange experience to orgasm with my body so tightly
restrained the way it was. Sometime during my orgasm he removed both his finger
and the vibrator, so that when I became aware of my surroundings once again, he
was not in front of me anymore. I took the break to reflect on the way he had
manipulated my body and had to accept that from now on it seemed that I would
not have any control over my own body anymore.�
The thought was overwhelming and I began to cry.� 

&nbsp;

I became aware of Master William�s hand on
my face as he raised it to look at me. He must have taken pity on me as he
reached around behind and took off the gag. I was still crying and just knew he
was going to ask me why.� �Slave, why are
you crying?� I took a deep breath and thought of what to say.� �I ..oh please don�t
make me tell you.�� I really didn�t want
to tell him what had made me cry, but when he picked up the flogger again and
hit me harder than before, I knew he again had the upper hand. �Ok, ok, please
stop. I will tell you.� He stopped but did not put the flogger down, instead
running it lightly over my body.� 

&nbsp;

�When you made me cum I just felt so�so
helpless and the thought of you being able to do that to me anytime you wanted
to just seemed too much.� He must have been satisfied
as he dropped the flogger back onto the floor.�
�Thank you for being honest with me, but next time I expect an answer
first time, no matter how private or embarrassing it may be.� I dropped my
head, another wave of helplessness washing over me. This time he let me be and
went behind me to loosen the rope holding my arms to the wall. �Kneel down.� At
first I didn�t know how I could with the spreader bar still in place but after
bending my knees almost to the floor, I found I could then move off my feet and
allow my knees to hit the floor.� 

&nbsp;

During my efforts to get to my knees, I had
not been aware of what he had been doing and got a shock when I looked up to
see his erect penis just inches from my face. �Slave, have you ever given a
blowjob before?�� I shook my head, hoping
that he would go easier on me.� �Ok, then
I will go slow this time, but don�t expect this every time.�� I had no time to think about what that might
mean, when he pushed the head of his cock into my mouth.� It felt big and heavy sitting on my tongue.
�Suck it but no teeth.�� I did as he
said, tasting his precum as I sucked on it. He patted
me on the head and then took a grip and held my head still.� The next thing I knew he had pushed his cock
further into my mouth until I could feel it stretching my throat.� It hurt and I began to gag.� No matter how hard I tried to pull back to
get it out of my throat his grip held me firm.�
Finally he pulled out, giving me time to breath and then pushed in
again, this time working his cock in and out at a steady pace. I was gagging
with each push in and could feel tears on my face. I don�t know how long it
went on for, but finally he held my head still and began to cum. I had no
choice but to swallow.� Once he had
pulled out, I started to cough and didn�t seem to be able to stop. I felt him
hold a glass to my lips and greedily drank the water. 

&nbsp;

I felt emotionally drained and I let my head
drop down as he walked around behind me.�
However, he didn�t seem to be finished, as he pulled on my nipples and
then held up two nasty looking clips for me to see. �Do you know where these
go?�� I had an awful feeling that I did. �On my nipples Master?� He smiled and I knew I was right.
�These will hurt but I need to see how long you can take them for.�� I took a deep breath as he pulled one nipple
out and then closed the clip over it. It did hurt, my groans growing as he put
one on the other nipple as well.� He
picked up the flogger again and started to hit me all over my body. They were
not too hard but I still felt each one. When he was done, he dropped to his
knees and used his fingers in my pussy, making me feel like I was going to cum,
until he pulled them out and brought his fingers to my lips.� Knowing where they had been, I hesitated
before allowing him to put his fingers into my mouth. The taste was not bad but
I still hated the humiliation he was causing me.� He repeated this a few times before he
flicked the clamps with his finger. 

&nbsp;

I realised they were not hurting anymore
but by the look on his face knew there was something I was missing.� He went as if to unclamp one, but stopped.
�Slave, this will hurt but take a deep breath and it will soon be over.�� I took a breath, but was not ready for the
pain that radiated all through my nipple.�
He quickly removed the other one and I wondered what torture he had in
mind for me next.� With my eyes closed I
could feel him untying my ankles from the bar and then my hands, pulling me up
to stand when I was free.� �Slave, you
did very well today and I am going to reward you with an hour�s rest before you
start to help out with the household chores.��


&nbsp;

We walked out of the room and I saw Gina
waiting on her knees.� When she saw us,
she straightened up and Master William lifted her up to her feet by her
hair.� I was not used to seeing woman
being treated that way and it still made me feel uneasy. �Gina, take Slave Jill
to her room and give her some lunch. After that she can have an hour�s rest
until she starts to learn her household duties.�� We started to walk off, when Master William
stopped us. �Oh, slave, I will see you later to
continue your education. I am looking forward to finding out if that pussy is
really as tight as it seems.�� I was so
embarrassed by not only what he had said but the way he had said it.� It was as if my feelings were not even
important, but then he was making me his slave, so I guess they weren�t. On the
way back to the room, I tried to take note of my surroundings, just in case I
had the opportunity to get away.� There
was no way I was going to spend the rest of my life as a slave!

Chapter 3

&nbsp;

I was trying to find
a comfortable spot, but just couldn�t find one that I could stay in for long.
Not that I had a lot of movement anyway, just a few inches of give for my legs
and arms. I was not even able to bend my knees with the way my arms were held
up. My ass and pussy were aching both from the rapes earlier and the fake cocks
Lee had pushed into them.� My ass was
particularly sore, having never let anyone go near it before. To make matters
worse, Lee�s words just keep going around and around in my head. I tried to
think back to any clues that might have shown his real nature, but all I could
remember was the nice guy he had seemed to be.�


&nbsp;

I was just so tired
but each time I would drift off to sleep, I would wake myself up as my body
pulled down on my arms, making the cuffs cut into my wrists.� All I could do was cry as I thought of all
that had happened and how I just wanted to go home.� I must have managed some sleep as I woke with
a start to the sound of Lee�s voice.�
There was a stream of light coming in to the room from a small hole in
the wall, so it must have been morning.�
�Good morning, Beth, I trust you had a good sleep.�� I wanted to scream at him, but the gag
rendered me speechless, so I just grunted a reply.� He went on taunting me regardless of how I
was feeling. �Good and I guess you must be thirsty, so let me just help you
with that.� 

&nbsp;

I wanted to think he
meant he would get me something to drink but I didn�t trust him at all
anymore.� He loosened the chain holding
my arms up and began to push me down to my knees.� The agony as my sore muscles were forced to
move was almost too much and I cried out with each move I had to make. Lee
pushed down even more forcefully and I felt my knees hit the floor with a thud
that rocked the dildos inside of me and made me scream even louder.� By the time I had recovered enough to see
what Lee was doing, I was shocked to see he had his cock out.� 

&nbsp;

�Beth, I am going to
remove your gag but do not even think of speaking.�� I was just so grateful the appalling gag was
coming out to even think of trying to speak.�
My jaw ached as he pulled out the gag and even with it out I was not
able to close my jaw without pain.� However,
Lee already had his cock in my mouth and I just thought he wanted to use my
mouth to cum. When I felt a liquid entering my mouth, I was confused at first
and then the truth hit me. He was peeing in my mouth!� I tried to pull my head away but he had a
firm grip and I could go nowhere.� As my
mouth got fuller, I knew I would have to swallow but just didn�t want to.� However, I soon had no choice as he held my
nose, blocking off my air until it was swallow or run out of air. 

&nbsp;

The feeling of his
pee running down into my throat was horrid and I felt like I was going to be
sick.� He didn�t remove his cock when he
was done but started to force it down into my throat.� When he was buried fully in me, he pulled
back my head, making me look up at him.�
�Make the most of the breakfast I am giving you bitch, as it is all you
will get for a while.�� He didn�t move
after he had spoken but just stayed in my throat until I felt my chest start to
burn, and I began to feel dizzy.� I was
close to passing out when he started to pump in and out until soon I had his
cum mixed in with his pee in my stomach.�


&nbsp;

When he pulled out
fully and bent down in front of me, I didn�t want to look at him.� I couldn�t even find the strength to cry,
just feeling so alone and used.� How
could this have all happened?� I had
always believed there was good in everyone but know I knew this was wrong. Lee
had no good in him at all or he wouldn�t be able to treat me like he was.� He didn�t say anything as he lifted by head
and buckled something around my neck. Then for the first time since I had been
brought into the room, he started to take off the cuffs, starting with the ones
around my wrists first. 

&nbsp;

I carefully moved my
arms to check the damage caused by the cuffs and saw that they were red where
the metal had been rubbing against them.�
Rubbing them to ease the pain, Lee also undid the cuffs on my
ankles.� I went to stretch out my legs
when I was pulled off balance by what seemed to be a chain attached to whatever
he had put around my throat.� I had to
move fast to stop myself from hitting the floor and groaned as I used my hands
to stop my fall.� Lee just laughed and
walked across the room, the chain in his hand growing taut as I realised I had
to crawl or be dragged across the floor.�


&nbsp;

My limbs were still
stiff and as he had not removed the dildos yet, I was feeling very
uncomfortable as I tried to keep up with him. The surface under me changed from
wooden floors to tiles. I could hear water dripping somewhere and was able to
see a big drain not so far away.� Giving
me no time to get used to my new surroundings, Lee twisted the chain around his
hand until there was only a little bit left and then used this to lift me to my
feet.� Standing, I could see something
that looked like a stand used in the hospital to hold a bag attached to a
drip.� I began to feel very scared of
what Lee might have planned and looked around for a way out.� 

�

It only took a tug
on my chain to remind me that I wasn�t going anywhere.� Lee pulled me into the corner of the room and
pushed me up against the wall.� Wincing
as he took my sore wrists in his hand, he tied them together and then pulled
them up.� I tried to pull them back down
but they were held firm to the thing around my neck.� Lee pulled me back and attached the chain
that was hanging down between my breasts to something in the ceiling.� He left me to go back into the other room and
came back with a long stick in his hand.�
I soon knew what it was for as he spread my legs and tied the ends to
each ankle. 

&nbsp;

�Beth, I know how
much you love having cocks in you, but I think it is time we took these ones
out. Don�t worry though, you won�t be empty for long.�� I tried not to think about what he might mean
as he bent down to undo the belt holding the cocks inside of me. It was strange
to feel the fake cocks deflate and then leave my holes, despite wanting them
out all night. Still getting used to the empty feeling, I was not prepared for
the spray of water that hit me full force on my breasts. Looking up, I could
see Lee holding a hose, an evil grin on his face. For the next few minutes I
was made to suffer the water spray as he moved it up and down my body, even
turning me around so it would hit my back as well.� By the time he turned off the water, I was
cold and dripping.� 

&nbsp;

He left me standing
there, shivering in the now cool air, and then came back wheeling the hospital
style stand over to me.� �Please Lee,
enough.�� I hadn�t thought about not
speaking as the words just flowed out of me, but as soon as I saw his face I
realised what I had done. He was in front of me in seconds and the slap seemed
like the hardest one yet. While I was trying to raise my head he surprised me
with another one on the other side of my face. This one was even harder and I
could not stop the tears forming in my eyes.�
My hair was gripped harshly and my head pulled back so I could see his
dark eyes glaring at me. 

&nbsp;

�What do I have to
do to get you to fucking shut up? Maybe you need to be gagged again.�� I tried to shake my head no but with his
strong grip I could barely move my head.�
He pushed my head down as he let go and stormed off to get what I
assumed was the same gag I had worn already.�
When he came back with what looked like my panties in his hand and a
roll of thick tape, I thought he must have just changed his mind.� 

&nbsp;

�Open up Beth.�� I did as he asked, still not understanding
what he was doing, and felt him stuffing my panties into my mouth.� I almost gagged as it threatened to go into
my throat and was afraid for a moment he was going to choke me with them. He
made sure my cheeks were stuffed full and then he started to wind the tape
around my mouth.� It was so tight I could
not close my lips together and could feel my cheeks bulging around the
tape.� Lee snapped the tape off, causing
me to flinch, and then lifted my head to check the gag.� 

&nbsp;

I tried to tell him
it was too tight, but it came out just sounding like a series of grunts.� Taking some deep breaths as I struggled to
get used to the feel of the gag, I jumped as his hand ran along the length of
my slit. I was still sore from last night and any touch on my sensitive flesh
was unwelcome.� Lee then undid the chain
holding me up and pulled it down until I was bent over.� I watched as he attached the chain to the
floor so I could not stand up.� My arms
were next, with him untying them from behind by neck and pulling them up, so
that by the time he was done I could not bend down any further either. Lee
rubbed his hand over my now exposed bottom and moved back away from me.� I heard Lee laugh and then something began to
push into my ass. It was smaller than the plug I had worn and really didn�t
hurt too much as it was pushed in, though I was still not used to having things
up my bottom.� 

&nbsp;

I jumped again as
Lee slapped my bottom a few times before I started to feel something be sprayed
up into me via the plug in my ass.� No
amount of squirming could get it out of me and I had to just watch as my
stomach expanded as it was filled with whatever he was putting in me.� His hand came and rubbed my stomach and then
moved lower to find my clit. As much as I didn�t want him to touch me, his
finger on my clit did cause some tingling sensations to flow through me. He
removed his finger, laughing at me and returned again to my now pregnant
looking stomach.� 

&nbsp;

When he went to sit
down and started to play with his cock, I figured something was going to
happen, but still didn�t really understand what to expect. It was not long
after that the cramps started and I yelled out in anguish.� I don�t know how long he left me in agony, my
only thought to expel the horrid liquid.�
I could hardly see him through my tears and so had not noticed when he
moved close to me again.� I felt his cock
push into my pussy and he began to pump, each time causing me a great deal of
pain.� As I was trying hard not to move,
his thrusts just felt even more powerful and it seemed like he was trying to
become a part of me.

&nbsp;

At that point I
would have done anything to get rid of whatever he had put into me and if my
mouth wasn�t gagged, I hate to think what I would have promised him. As it was,
I just had to put up with his vile use of my body and hope he would cum
soon.� He seemed to speed up even more,
and then I felt his spunk spurt into me, though he kept his cock in me even
after he had come.� His fingers came
around and pinched my nipples, his mouth close to my ear. �Beth, have you
worked out what the enema is for yet?�
I�m sure you will, you are a smart girl. Now, when I take out the plug,
you are not to let go but have to hold it all in until I say, understand?�� At this last word, he twisted my nipples and
I screamed out my answer.� 

&nbsp;

Feeling the plug
being pulled out, I had to squeeze hard not to just let go, my stomach churning
in an agony that made me want to curl up on the floor. Finally, he was back in
his chair and told me I could release it now. I tried to ignore the horrible
sounds and the even more disgusting smell as I emptied my stomach.� The spray of the cold water surprised me but
at least it was washing the mess down the drain.� Lee�s laughter filled the room and he moved
around behind me with the hose and sprayed my ass area, the force threatening
to send me forward.

&nbsp;

I felt humiliated by the thought of what I had been forced to do and
just hung my head in shame.� Lee started
to release me, leaving the chain holding me to the floor to last. I know I
could have kicked out but I just felt so exhausted and he still had the chain
anyway.� I was dragged into the next room
and made to sit down on the floor, the first time I had been able to sit since
my world had turned upside down.� I
should have known I would not just be allowed to sit, as Lee began to tie rope
around each ankle. I was just so tired that I had to close my eyes.� I could feel my legs being bent and then
pulled out to the side as my ankles were tied to my thighs. Opening my eyes, I saw
Lee pull down what looked a trapeze swing and raised my arms to cuff them to
the bar at each end.� He moved behind me
and I heard a strange noise just as I became aware that the bar was moving up.� With no way of stopping the rise of the bar,
I felt my body leave the floor.� 

&nbsp;

Lee came over and tied rope from the bar down to my ankles, which kept
me from being able to close my legs.� He
then gave me a push and made me spin, making me feel sick. It took a while for
me to come to a stop and as I did I became aware of three men coming into the
room.� I recognised the two men from last
night, even with their masks on but I didn�t know man who was with them. A
feeling of dread flowed through me as the man stared at me.� He was dressed all in black and had an aura
of confidence that scared me. I just had a feeling I would soon find out more
about this man than I wanted to know.

Chapter 4

&nbsp;

Lee shook the stranger�s hand and I could see them looking at me but
could not hear what they were saying. Lee and the stranger came over to me and
I felt my heart beating hard as they walked around me, hands running over my
body.� �She looks good Lee.� Is it ok if I spend some time alone with her
before I give you my final decision?��
Decision?� I wondered what
decision he had to make, though I had a niggling feeling that it was one I
wouldn�t like. �That�s fine, I�ll be back in an hour or so.� Lee and the other
guys left, leaving me alone with the stranger.�
Although I was tired, I felt a rush of adrenaline go through me at the
thought of what he might want of me.� He came
around to the front of me and ran his hands over my cheeks, my body shaking as
he lowered his hands to my breasts. �Hello my pet.� I know that you will do everything I say,
won�t you?� I nodded, his voice sending shivers down my spine.� 

&nbsp;

�Good, now I am going to remove this gag, but you need to stay
silent.�� He pulled out a pair of
scissors from his pocket and cut the tape off one side. I moaned as he pulled
off the tape and pulled out my now soaked panties.� My mouth felt dry and my jaw was sore, as I
tried to work my jaw closed. The man laughed as he held up my wet panties and
in this one action, I knew that he would no better then Lee in the way he
treated me.� Despair filled me and for
what felt like the hundredth time I just wished I could make it all not real.
His hand forced my chin up, making me look into his dark eyes. 

&nbsp;

�Beth, my name is Master Rick and that is what I expect you to call
me.� If I decide to buy you, I will give
you a different name, but for today you can stay as Beth.�� The shock of what he said must have shown on
my face. �Oh boy, Lee said you were an innocent but didn�t realize how much of
one you would be.� I think this is going
to be fun.�� I didn�t know which scared
me more, the fact that he called himself master, that he was thinking of buying
me or that he would change my name. It was just too much to take and I felt the
tears come to my eyes again.� Master Rick
was behind me and I felt him checking the ropes holding me up before he moved
away.� 

&nbsp;

The sound was the first thing I heard before a horrendous pain spread
over my back.� My scream filled the room
and I found it hard to breath.� My back
felt like he had cut it and I imagined I could feel blood flowing.� I heard the sound again and closed my eyes,
tensing my body as I waited for the pain to strike again.� This time it was my lower back and again I
screamed. He did not let up, moving all around my body, my voice going hoarse
with all my screams.� I began to feel
lightheaded with the pain and everything started to go dark.� 

&nbsp;

The water hitting my body roused me, my whole body in agony. I opened
my eyes to see Master Rick smirking at me, an empty bucket still in his
hands.� Feeling cold and sore, I didn�t
think I could take much more, so when he came towards me again, I just started
to whimper. His hand reaching out to touch me made me try to flinch away from
him, but he just gripped my by the hair and held me still.� �Beth, if I decide to take you, you will not
back away from me. Now, I need you to answer some questions.�� I hated the thought of telling him anything
but I wasn�t in the position to say no.

&nbsp;

�First, before last night, how long had it been since you had
sex.�� It seemed absurd that I was
expected to talk about my private sex life but I feared what he would do it I
didn�t answer. �About eight months.�� The
slap took me by surprise and I felt tears come to my eyes as my cheek throbbed
in pain.� I didn�t know what I had done
wrong, I had answered his question hadn�t I?�
He again took my hair in his hand and pulled my head back. �I remember
telling you to use my name every time you speak to me, do you remember that?�
My stomach clenched in fear as I realised what I had done. �I�m sorry Master
Rick, it has been about eight months, Master Rick.�� 

&nbsp;

I was terrified of what he would do, the pain he had already caused my
body evident of what kind of man he was.�
He smiled his evil smile and let my hair go. �Don�t let that happen
again Beth. How often do you make yourself cum?�� I could feel myself blush as I thought of
what he was asking me. �Master, I don�t, I mean I usually don�t��� I screamed as my nipples were twisted in his
fingers.� �Beth, don�t try my patience.
Now answer the question.�� He still had
my nipples in his firm grip. �Sorry Master, maybe once every few weeks.�� I thought he wasn�t going to let go, my
nipples feeling like he was going to twist them off, until he finally he let go
and ran his hands over my breasts.

&nbsp;

�How do you do it?�� His hands
were hovering over my nipples in warning, so I answered him as honestly as I
could. �I use my fingers Master.�� I
almost knew what he was going to ask me next and felt my blush deepen further.
�How do you use your fingers?�� �I rub my
clit and sometimes I push a finger inside myself.�� I hoped that would satisfy him and thought it
had when he started to lower my body to the ground and uncuffed� my hands from the bar. I was gingerly
stretching them out when he squatted down in front of me. �Show me.� 

&nbsp;

For a moment I didn�t know what he meant and then I realised he wanted
me to masturbate in front of him.� Even
after all the indignities I had suffered, I still felt embarrassed at what he
wanted me to do. �I see you need some incentive to get started.� He held up an
innocent looking object, but it did not seem so innocent when he held it too my
breast and I received a shock. �Did you feel that Beth?� If you don�t get started, I will just shock
you until you do.�� It was not a hard
decision to make and I brought my hand down to my pussy.� Master Rick still held the device close to my
breast as my fingers began to rub.� I was
still wet from when Lee had cum in me earlier, so it wasn�t hard to get my
fingers inside. Closing my eyes, I rubbed my clit and waited for the familiar
feelings to start to build.� For a while
nothing happened as I thought about being watched but then I started to feel
the warmth spreading through me and I soon forgot where I was.� Not long after I came and I just wanted to
enjoy the feeling of peace I always felt afterwards, but the sound of clapping
brought me back to my present surroundings.�


&nbsp;

�Very nice Beth, that is something I could never grow tired of.� I hung
my head in shame as he walked around me and then pushed on my back so I rocked
forward on my knees.� He came around and
pulled my arms up behind my back and attached them the collar, forcing my head
down to the ground. I moaned in pain as my arms were made to stay up in the
air. I was just so tired and closed my eyes until I felt something cold being
rubbed into my ass. I tensed up as he pressed his fingers into me, moving the
around to stretch me out.� I was shaking
and tried to move away, but was held firm. �Beth, you need to relax.� I tried
but kept thinking of how much it had hurt when the men had used both my pussy
and ass at the same time. He laid the head of his cock on my asshole for a
moment before he started to push.� I felt
my whole body being pushed forward until he gripped my hips firmly and applied
even more pressure. Without the gag in, my screams were loud and continuous as
he tried to get the head in.� He hit my
ass a number of times and finally it was in and I already felt full.� 

&nbsp;

Once he had the head in, he surged forward, his cock filling up my ass
with a force that I thought would split me in two. �Oh, that is nice baby.� I love a tight ass.�� I grunted as he 

pulled out until the head of his cock was again stretching out my
asshole and gripping me tightly, leant forward to whisper in my ear. �Like that
baby?� Just wait until I get you home and
really get you stretched out.�� He gave
me no time for what he had said to sink in, as he started to piston his cock in
and out of my ass. I had nowhere to go as he held me tight and just had to
suffer the agonizing feeling as his cock rubbed my ass raw.� He never seemed to tire as my screams filled
the room.� I was barely aware of anything
when I saw a foot in front of me and my head was pulled up to see Lee staring
into my eyes.� 

&nbsp;

�Well, Rick, is she all I said she was?�� Lee had my hair in a fierce grip as he
brought his lips down on mine and kissed me ruthlessly, his teeth biting my
tongue before he pushed me away.� I could
taste blood in my mouth and went to spit it out just as Lee shoved his cock in.
He didn�t pause as he pushed all the way to the back of my throat, my sore
tongue being rubbed by his cock on the way.�
He hand at the back of my head held me in place as Master Rick continued
to pound my ass from behind.� I struggled
to get his cock out of me so I could breath but his grip was too tight and I
felt my chest start to burn. Master Rick gripped me tighter as I felt his cum
spurt deep inside of me before he pulled out and spurted over my back.� My head was dizzy and I was one the verge of
passing out when Lee finally pulled out, him cum being added to the cum already
congealing on my back.� 

&nbsp;

I felt broken and collapsed on the floor, my whole body aching.� I was vaguely aware of the two men talking
and then I was untied and forced to stand by a hand pulling me up by my
hair.� My legs were weak and I found it
hard to stand up, Lee�s tight grip the only thing keeping me upright.� He let go of my hair and as I started to
fall, gripped my nipples and dragged me over to the wall.� My back hit the wall with a thud as he pushed
his body into mine.� �Beth, I am going to
miss you but it is time for you to start your new life with your Master.� I am sure though that it will not be the last
time I will see you.� I went to turn away from him, but he wouldn�t even let me
do that. I looked up at him and tried to remember the gentle man he had been,
but all I could think of was all the horrid things he had done to me. �Ah, here
comes your new owner now.�� Lee pulled me
away from the wall with a tug on my arm, throwing me into the arms of Master
Rick.� 

&nbsp;

�Here she is, my beautiful new slave. Lee would you help me get her
ready to transport?� I thought I didn�t care anymore but as the reality of his
words sunk in, I began to fight and managed to get one kick in before I was
forced down to the ground.� I felt
pressure on my head as my legs were strapped together. The foot was removed
from my head and I was again pulled up to stand unsteadily on my bound legs.
Lee held me firm as more belts were used to bind my arms firmly to my
sides.� Master Rick picked up what looked
to be a number of belts, but when he held it up in front of my face, I could
see a ball in the middle.� He pushed the
ball into my mouth and as each strap was tightened I could feel the ball being
pushed in further.� The final strap under
my chin meant I couldn�t even open my mouth a tiny bit and I had to fight the
urge to panic.� 

&nbsp;

I was picked up and placed onto a large mat.� Lee bent down beside my head, looking into my
eyes. �Beth, I have something for you to remember me by. Have fun!�� I felt his hands on my nipples and moaned as
he clamped them with something.� I had no
time to see what it was as the mat was lifted over me and I was rolled over and
over until I was tightly bound inside of it. Grunting as I was lifted up off
the ground, I began to cry as I knew I had no way of escaping the darkness that
my life had become. I still couldn�t believe how Lee had betrayed me and turned
my life into a living nightmare.� Worst
still, I knew the nightmare had only just begun.

&nbsp;

The end ..for now.

Chapter 5

&nbsp;

I opened my eyes to see Master William
walking back into the room, his hair wet.�
�Good morning, slave. I thought I was going to have to wake you up. Get
up and have a shower, we have a another big day ahead
of us today.�� I was half way into the
bathroom when I remember Gina. Master William pushed me into the room and
removed the cuffs, my wrists red and a little bit sore.� �You have ten minutes.�� Although the water felt wonderful, I couldn�t
enjoy it as I thought of Gina.� �Five
minutes slave, you better be ready in time.� I quickly finished washing off the
soap and dried off, walking out just as he was about to come into the room.

&nbsp;

Breakfast was a quiet affair, with all of
the slaves looking at me and then at Gina. I tried to catch Gina�s eye but she
would not look at me and I noticed she wasn�t eating much.� I didn�t feel hungry either, the thought of
Gina being punished because of me making me feel sick. Master William pushed
his chair back and I was not the only one to jump, everyone seeming to be on
edge.� �Slave Gina, I want you in the
lounge room right now, Slave Jill, you stay with me. The rest of you need to
clean up and then join us.� 

&nbsp;

My mouth felt dry as I stood up. I saw Gina
give Master William a nervous look as she headed off to the lounge. I hoped he
would not be too hard on her and wished I had the nerve to ask him what he
intended doing. I started as he spoke to me, my attention on Gina. �Slave, in a
few moments you will see how what one person does can affect the whole household.
I hope this is the last time another slave will need to be punished because of
something you did.�� Tears came to my
eyes as I thought of what I had done. �Master, please
don�t be too hard on Gina, it wasn�t her fault.�� I gasped as he pulled back my hair, the look
in his eyes serious as he gripped my chin in his hands.

&nbsp;

�Slave, how I treat my slaves is my
business. Don�t ever try to tell me what to do again.�� He let go and I stumbled back, shaken by the
tone of his voice.� �Come on, we don�t want
to keep Gina waiting too long.�� I
followed him into the lounge, eager to have the whole thing behind us.� Gina was kneeling down on the rug and looked
up nervously at Master William as he approached her, his hand gently running
over her hair.� �Stand slave.� Before we start I need you to understand why
I am doing this.� You were put in charge
of watching over our new slave and you failed in that task. This
punishment in to remind you to always be focused on what you have been asked to
do. Now, let�s get started.�� 

&nbsp;

Watching the two of them, I could see that
while Gina was scared, there was also a certain amount of determination to
please him.� I realised that their
relationship was so much more complicated than I had first thought.� It scared me to think of being that devoted
to someone who had so much power over you and vowed to never let myself get
that way.� Master William pulled out a
blindfold and tied it around Gina�s eyes just as the other slaves started to
come into the room. They congregated together on the other side of the room,
their concern for Gina showing in their faces.�


&nbsp;

�Good, we are all here.� Before we begin, I need to remind all of you
that Gina is being punished because she did not pay
the attention needed to watch over our new slave Jill. �However, I want to make it clear that Jill has
been punished and after we are done here, no more will be said about the
matter.� Like all new slaves, Jill made a
mistake and I want you to help to guide her in the right way to act.� �Yes
Master.� They had all spoken as one and again I could see the need to please
showing in their eyes.� It was too weird
the way they all looked at him like he was a god and I� found myself growing even more
determined not to let myself be like them. 

&nbsp;

�Gina has been blindfolded to remind her
that she was not looking when she should have been. The reason she was
distracted was because she was busy with the vacuum, so for the next fifteen
minutes, Gina will have another piece of machinery to be distracted by.�� We all gasped as the guy who had caught me
the day before carried in a machine with one of the biggest dildos I had ever
seen attached to it.� He placed it down
on the floor while Master William made Gina go down on her hands and knees and
then tied her arms and legs in place so that she could not move at all. While
Master William used his fingers and then some lube to make Gina�s pussy ready,
the other man plugged the device in and placed it on a low table,.� When Master
William stood up, the table was moved so that the dildo was sitting right at
the entrance to her pussy.� 

&nbsp;

I held my breath as the machine started up
slowly, Gina�s moans turning into screams of pain as the dildo slowly worked it�s way into her.� As
the machine began to pick up a bit of speed, she seemed to be able to cope with
it a bit better and I felt myself relaxing a bit.� Master William walked over to me and stood
behind me, his arms pulling me in tight.�
I wondered if he thought I was going to try to run again as he took my
hands and held them together in front of me with one his hands.� Gina�s moans were getting louder as the
machine picked up more pace and she shook in what
looked to be a massive orgasm. I looked at the clock on the wall and saw that
she still had over ten minutes to go.

&nbsp;

�Ok, everyone go and get on with your jobs.
Jill you will stay here and watch until Gina�s punishment is over.� He kept his
grip firm as Gina struggled as the machine started to go even faster, making
her grunt in time with each thrust.� I
couldn�t look anymore and turned my head away only to have it turned back
around. �Oh no, slave, you need to see every minute.� Being made to watch was
almost as hard as my punishment yesterday, the same feeling of being helpless
washing over me.� I knew I had to think
of some way to get out of the house, not willing to yet accept that this was
all my life would be. Gina was shaken again by another orgasm and I could see
the sweat covering her body as the machine continued to pound into her.� 

&nbsp;

Without thinking, I again tried to turn my
head away only to have my chin seized tightly. �What did I say, Slave, keep
your eyes on her or maybe you might find yourself in her place.� He held on for
another minute or so before moving his hand away and bringing it down between
my legs.� I spread my legs and let his
hand in, knowing that now was not the time to appear non-compliant.� On the mat, Gina was moaning louder again as
yet another orgasm hit her.� Looking at
the clock, I was relieved to see her time was almost up. 

&nbsp;

Master�s fingers were rubbing gently along
my slit, making me squirm in his arms. I could feel his cock digging into my
back as he pulled me against him and tried to block out the way he was making
me feel.� Gina screamed as the machine sped
up even more, her whole body shaking.�
Just as I thought she could not hold out much longer the machine began
to slow down and finally come to a stop.�
Master William let me go and went down to release Gina from her
restraints.� I stood and watched, hating
the fact that I was too scared to move.�
Master William gently helped Gina to her feet, removing the blindfold as
she cried softly.� �It�s
ok baby, your punishment is over. Jill, come here and help Gina to the bathroom
so she can have a bath. I am trusting that you will not try anything else to
get either of you into trouble.�� 

&nbsp;

I knew that now was not the time to try to
escape, not wanting to get Gina into any more trouble.� Taking her from Master William�s arms, I was
shocked to see a look of concern in his eyes.�
Leading her off to the bathroom, I again tried to work out the nature of
the relationship between Master and the other slaves.� Gina didn�t say a word as I filled the bath
with water, adding a good amount of bath oil so that the bubbles filled the
bath.� She let me help her in the bath
and lay with her head back for a few minutes before looking at me for the first
time all day. �Jill, I am sorry I treated you the way I did, I had forgotten
how terrified I was when I first came to be Master William�s slave.� I do understand why you did what you did, I
think once I would have done the same thing given the opportunity.�� 

&nbsp;

Feeling only relief that she was talking to
me again, I squatted down by the bath.�
�Jill, I didn�t even ask how you coped with your punishment, was it too
awful?� �I don�t know why but I just
couldn�t answer her and started to cry.�
She put her arm around my shoulder and let me cry. �Baby cry, we all
need to at times.� Once I had regained some control over my emotions, she got
out of the bath and started to dry off. �Sorry Gina, sometimes I just feel so
overwhelmed by everything. You know, like I am helpless.� Do you ever feel like that?�� She put the towel back on the rake and sat me
down beside her on the edge of the bath.�


&nbsp;

�Jill, you will feel that way for a while
longer yet, but one day you will start to want to please Master William, not
because you are scared of being punished but because you realise he is your
life.� I am not unhappy here, I don�t
even think I could survive in the world anymore, but I am aware of my
place.� There are still times, like this
morning, when I feel helpless, but usually I like the fact that I am an
important part of someone�s life. I know this properly makes no sense to you,
but I hope in time you will learn to be happy here too.� I was just about to
respond, when Master William appeared in the doorway.

&nbsp;

�Good to see you two talking again.� I had hoped you would be able to get over
what has happened.� Gina, go and help out
in the kitchen. Jill, come with me.� I wondered what he wanted from me now, my
emotions feeling raw after the last few days. He took me by the elbow, his
silence as we walked down the hallway to a room I had not seen before making me
nervous. Opening the door, I braced myself for what I might see.� What I did see took my breath away and I had
to look twice to make sure I was not seeing things.� In front of me was a room with a whole shelf
full of paints, brushes and other art supplies, all the things I thought I
would never get to use again.� Looking to
the other side of the room, I saw canvases and paper ready to use.� 

&nbsp;

�Slave, I told you that I reward my slaves
when they deserve it and I thought it might help you to see what your reward
would be.� I know that you were studying
art before you were captured, so I have collected a range of art supplies for
your use. Of course, you will have to have no more escape attempts and do what
you are told to get to use these. Well, what do you say?�� I was in shock and it took a moment to
realise he had stopped speaking. �Master, thank you.�
For the first time, I really felt like I meant it, the thought of being able to
do my art again making me feel hopeful. 

&nbsp;

�Just to let you know that this is
something you will get to do, I will give you thirty minutes now to show me how
good an artist you are. After that, this room will be out of bounds until I
decide you have shown me your willingness to submit.�� I hardly even heard what he was saying as I
itched to get my hands on the supplies. He must have noticed my eagerness, as
he laughed. �Go on, I can see you are already thinking of what you can do. I
will return soon.�� He left and I didn�t
even wait until he was out the door before I headed over to the shelf to see
what he had bought.� Dismissing the
paint, I picked up the pastels and a sketchbook and lost myself in my
work.� I draw like a maniac, filling up
one page after another with images from the last few days.� I had always been able to sketch quickly and
by the time Master William had returned I had done over ten sketches.� I didn�t hear him open the door and only
became aware of his presence as he coughed.�
Jumping, I dropped the book on the floor and he picked it up, his face
showing some surprise as he looked at my work.

&nbsp;

�Jill, these are very good.� You have a real talent.� I felt some pride at
his praise and then another emotion began to take over, that of regret that
while I might be able to do my art again one day, I would never get to show my
art to the world.� �Slave, do you not like
my opinion of your work?� Thinking of what to tell him, I decided to just tell
him the truth. �Master, I am glad you like my work and that you will allow me
to practise my art again, but I am sad that I will never get to display my
art.� Please don�t think that I am
ungrateful for all this but I had always dreamed..�� I stopped, words failing me as my dream of
being a famous or at least well known artist, faded before my eyes.� 

&nbsp;

�Slave, I am sorry that your dream may not
get to be a reality but life does not always turn out the way we planned
it.�� I glared at him, my anger rising to
the surface as he dismissed my dreams like they were nothing.� Suddenly I remembered what he had said about
slaves going on trips to the city with him and a plan began to form.� I fought down my anger and dropped my eyes to
the ground.� �Master, sorry.� It has just been such an emotional time and I
am still trying to come to terms with all the changes in my life.� I will try to make you proud of me.�� I had to struggle to keep my voice sounding
contrite, wanting him to think I was willing to give up my dreams for him.� He seemed to believe me and gave me a hug
before letting me pack up the pastels and place them back on the shelf.� I found a surge of hope as I thought about my
plan, which I hoped would see me free one day.

Chapter 6

&nbsp;

Over the next few months I worked hard to
be the best slave I could be, not hesitating to do what I was told no matter
how much I hated it.� Master William
began to treat me like one of the other slaves, only singling me out when he
wanted to use my body or to take me to the room to play with his bondage
gear.� I had been allowed to use the art
room a few times a week and this morning he had told me what I had been waiting
to hear since the day I had made up my mind to pretend to be the best slave
there was.

&nbsp;

He had called me into his office, opening
his legs to let me know I had to service him. I knelt down in front of him and
pulled down his zip.� I had learnt over
the months what he liked and despite still hating the way it made me feel, I
never let it show.� I licked his balls,
just the way he liked it, and then worked my tongue up the underside of his
cock before taking just the head into my mouth. He moaned as I ran my tongue
around the tip of his head, tickling the small hole and then moved my head
forward so that his cock sat deep in my throat. Master grabbed my hair but
still let me control my movements as I worked my head back and forwards on his
cock.� It had taken me a few months to
control my gagging and even now I still gagged at times, but mostly I could now
deep throat without stopping.� His grip
got tighter and he took control, holding his cock deep into my throat as he
came in me.� I felt my air lessen as he
held me still, finally pulling out as my head began to get a bit dizzy.� He gave me a moment to recover, his hand
rubbing my hair to tell me I had done a good job.� At first it had been hard to pretend that I
was starting to like his treatment of me, but I just tried to keep focused on
my goal of escape.� Now I knew he thought
I was becoming just like the other girls, a slave both in mind and body.� 

&nbsp;

�Slave, come and sit on my lap, I have some
news for you.�� My heart stopped, hoping
it was the news I has been waiting to hear but bracing myself for it to be
something else.� Settling myself on his
knees so that I was sitting astride him looking into his face, I made myself
smile as he played lightly with my nipples.�
�Slave, I have been very happy with your efforts to please me over the
last few months.� I told you when you
first came here that I like to reward my slaves sometimes with a trip away and
I think you have earned that trip.��
Inside I was jumping for joy but I just smiled at him, waiting for him
to tell me more. �This afternoon I need to go in to the city for the night so
that I can attend a meeting early tomorrow morning.� I thought you might like to go and visit the
art gallery. I have heard it is quite a good one.� This time I couldn�t keep my
excitement down and hugged him.� Luckily
he thought I was excited by the thought of going to a gallery, having no idea
this fit right into my escape plan. 

&nbsp;

�Of course, I expect perfect behaviour. No
one must know your status; on this trip you will be my girlfriend.� Plus you will have to be restrained while I
am at the meeting, but we will have a nice meal out and you will get to dress
up if you decide to go.�� I had no
thought of not going, thinking if my plan worked I would not be around in the
morning for him to restrain me.� I
couldn�t think of failing in my escape, as it would be the last time for a long
time, if ever, that I would have the chance again. He lifted me off his lap and
pulled a shopping bag from under the desk. �Here is an outfit you need to wear.
Go and have a shower and be ready in an hour to leave.� 

&nbsp;

�I
went to walk out, the bag in my hands when he stopped my by grapping my
hair.� �Slave, I hope that you appreciate
the chance I am taking.� I trust you
won�t let me down.�� I looked at him,
feeling a slight twinge of guilt at what I was planning to do.� �Master, I won�t let you down, I
promise.�� He smiled, one of the smiles
he uses when he knows something you don�t. �That�s right slave, for if you let
me down, you will not only be punished but you will not get an opportunity like
this again for a long time.�� I nodded
and he let go, giving my bottom a slap as I went off to the bathroom.� 

&nbsp;

I could hardly contain my excitement as I showered, my head full of ways I might get out of his grasp.
I tried not to get too excited, knowing that the right opportunity might not
present itself this trip.� Getting
dressed after my shower felt very strange, as it was the first time in months
that I had worn clothes.� I looked in the
mirror, thinking how different I looked, the outfit sexy but not slutty.� I had not
heard Master William and jumped as he appeared in the doorway and gave a low
whistle. �I know that I like to see you naked but there is something to be said
for a beautiful, sexy outfit. But we have to go.�� I took a last look in the mirror, feeling a
rush of nervous excitement.� 

&nbsp;

The other slaves were working in the
kitchen and I only had the chance to say a quick goodbye, everyone assuming we
would be back tomorrow.� Master William
left Gina in charge, but with the two men who both worked around the house and
acted as guards, watching over the slaves as well. Driving along, I savoured
the surrounding countryside, not having seen outside of the grounds of the
house before. As the city approached, he pulled the car over into a picnic area
and turned to me. �Slave, we are almost at the motel and I just wanted to make
sure you know what to do.� You do not
speak unless you are spoken to and you in no way try to attract the attention
of anyone.� I will just register and then
we can head off to the art gallery.� I was so excited that I could hardly sit
still. �Now I know it has been a while since you have been out of the house,
but you will have to settle down. It would be a shame to have to give the
gallery a miss.�� 

&nbsp;

I made an effort to sit still, not wanting
him to change his mind about the gallery.�
By the time we pulled into the motel, I felt like I was about to burst.
As we walked into the motel, it seemed funny to see people going about their
lives, free to come and go as they pleased. Master William had his hand on my elbow
and I made sure I didn�t look at anyone as we headed to the reception
desk.� He was very polite as he got our
room key, even flirting a bit with the girl behind the desk.� If she only knew what he was really like, I
didn�t think she would be smiling at him the way she was. Once we had the room
keys, Master William led me back out to the car and we headed a few blocks away
to the gallery.

&nbsp;

�At
first I was lost in the art but then I remembered my plan and started to take
note of where the exits were.� It was
after we had been in the gallery for about thirty minutes and Master had
relaxed a bit, that I saw what I had been looking for. We were in a section of
the gallery with a number of sculptures standing on short pillars and a guard
watching over the room in the corner. I walked over to the first sculpture,
Master�s hand resting lightly on my elbow and just as I turned to go to the
next piece, used all my strength to push him into the sculpture.� In his surprise, he let go of me and tumbled
to the ground, the sculpture falling to the floor with a loud crash.� The guard came rushing over as he heard the
noise but I had already managed to make it to the entrance to the room.� 

&nbsp;

While everyone rushed in to see what all
the fuss was about, I walked out, not daring to look back in case I saw him
behind me.� My heart was beating so fast
and I felt sure I was going to feel Master William�s hand on me at any moment
but I somehow made it to the front door.�
I stepped out of the gallery and walked down the street, realising now
that I was free, I had nowhere to go and no money. I thought about going to the
police, but the thought of explaining to them what had happened just didn�t
seem like much fun. I was about five blocks away from the gallery when I
stopped, realising I still had his coat jacket over my shoulders. He had put it
on me when the gallery started to get cold; the looks of admiration in the eyes
of the surrounding women making him flash them one of his stunning smiles.� 

&nbsp;

I felt in the pockets and found some paper
and a pen, then just as I was about to think I wouldn�t find anything useful, I pulled out a fifty-dollar note.� I knew it wouldn�t get me far but at least it
was something. The sound of a train behind me gave me an idea and I ran in the
direction of the noise, seeing a station just down the end of the street. I was
starting to panic, thinking Master would had made it
out of the gallery by now and could come around the corner at any moment.� I ran into the station and bought a ticket
for the next train, which luckily had just pulled up.� As I sat in the seat, the reality of what I
had done hit me and I started to shake.�
I had no idea where the train was going, but it was taking me further
away from him with every minute.� The man
across the way kept looking at me and I made an attempt to pull my skirt down
so I was not showing off so much of my legs, finally putting Master�s coat over
my knee.� By then the man had stood and I
prepared to run, before he simply walked to the door, getting off at the next
station.� My hands were shaking so badly
that I hid them under the coat, my mind trying to think of what to do.� 

&nbsp;

Finally the train reached its final stop, a
small town about thirty minutes out of the city. Having no choice but to get
off, I put the coat back on and headed down the platform, wondering where to go
now. I looked around me, seeing a few people heading to cars, but not knowing
which direction I should head in.� A
voice behind me made me jump and I turned to see a middle aged woman looking at
me with real concern on her face.

&nbsp;

�Honey, do you need some help? I don�t mean
to pry but not many people get off here and you look a bit lost.� My intention
was to say I was fine but her concern was enough to make be start to cry.
Before I knew it, she had bundled me into her car and taken me a few streets
away to her house. 

&nbsp;

A warm bath and a bowl of soup later, I was
sitting in a comfy lounge chair, while she sat and knitted in front of the
fireplace.� I sipped my tea, waiting for
her to ask me about myself, but she just kept on knitting. She had told me her
name was Helen as she had given me the soup, but had let me eat in silence.
Part of me still felt like I was in a dream, but I had really done it, escaped
from Master William. I shivered as I thought of how angry he must be and saw
her put down her knitting. �Dear, I had decided to wait for you to tell me what
is wrong but I just don�t think I can. I know you might not want to tell me
anything but at least let me know your name.��


&nbsp;

�Of course, I wasn�t thinking, my name is J..Jenny.� For some reason, I
didn�t want to tell her my real name. �I can�t thank you enough for helping
me.�� She stood and came to sit on a seat
closer to me, her face looking very motherly in the firelight.� �Dear, I can tell you are nervous and I
couldn�t help but notice the marks on your body when you got into the
bath.� I don�t want to intrude but if you
want to talk to me you can.�� I really wanted
to tell her about Master William but it was still too soon. She seemed to
understand and patted my hand, making me jump.�
�Let me show you where you can sleep and tomorrow we will work out what
you can do.�

&nbsp;

She led me upstairs to a small but cosy
room and I found myself asleep in no time.�
When I awoke to the sounds of birds outside the window, I jumped out of
the bed, not knowing where I was. Where was Master William?� He would be angry if I woke him up? Slowly
the events of the day before came back to me and I sat back down on the bed. My
heart was beating fast and I had to take a few deep breaths to calm down. The
knock at the door made me jump. �Jenny, are you up dear?� Can I come in?� It was so strange to have
someone ask to come in rather then just barging in. �Yes, come in.�� She poked her head around the door, a dress
in her hands. �This is a dress my daughter left here when she moved to the
city. I am sure she wouldn�t mind if you wore it.� I could only nod, her
kindness overwhelming me and she shut the door again. 

&nbsp;

I dressed and headed down stairs, the
smells coming from the kitchen reminding me how hungry I was.� Over a serve of bacon and eggs, I told Helen
a story about escaping from an abusive husband and my need to get far away.
�Dear, I thought it might be something like that. Now don�t you worry, as I am
going to pay for a bus ticket for you to go where you think you might be safe.� I help up my hand to say it was too much. �When I was
your age I had to do just what you have done and since then I have tried to
help out any other woman I think might need it. If it makes you feel better,
you can repay me one day.�� I sighed and
hugged her, feeling like I could really get my life back. 


A week later I was sitting in my new apartment, Helen having also given me
enough money to last me for at least a few weeks. I had bought some paints and
canvases, painting some very commercial paintings. As I thought, these had sold
easily at the local caf� and they had asked me for more.� Over the next few months I started to
establish a name for myself, or at least my made up name, and gradually I began
to feel safe. I still woke in the middle of the night thinking I was back with
Master William and had to check all the doors and windows were locked before I
could go back to sleep. My paintings were selling well and I found myself working
all day to keep up with demand, which helped to keep my mind off what had
happened.

&nbsp;

One day I was approached to do a show in
one of the bigger galleries in town and from there I was asked to do more until
I was making quite a name for myself.� It
had been over a year since I had escaped and I could actually go a day without
thinking about Master William.� When I
was asked a few months later to go on a local talk show, I accepted, my new
name and new hair colour giving me the confidence that I would not be
recognised.� It felt so good to be talked
about as a rising talent and to have my art admired by so many people. My life
as a slave stated to fade even more from my thoughts as I made new friends and
attended fancy parties.� 

&nbsp;

I was on my way to another gallery opening
for an artist friend, having come home to change, when I noticed something on
the table that made my heart stop.� I
picked up the piece of rope, my hands shaking as I tried to think of a logical
reason why it could be there.� I had no
time to move as the hand came down to cover my mouth.� The voice in my ear was unmistakable. �Slave
Jill, you have caused me a lot of trouble.�
I hope you are ready to make it up to me.�� He spun me around and I was once again face
to face with the man I had hoped to never see again. I tried to read his eyes,
to see how angry he was, but he was not giving anything away.� 

&nbsp;

He manhandled me
over to my couch and pushed me down onto my knees.� I moaned as I hit the floor with a thud and
he tied my arms behind me with the piece of rope he had left on the table.� Coming around to sit on the couch in front of
me, his hand gripped my hair firmly enough for tears to come to my eyes. �I was in shock, not able to believe he had
found me again. �Slave you have a punishment coming, but we will get to that
soon.� He looked around the room, seeming to enjoy making me wait. �I see you
have done very well for yourself Jill or should I say Jenny?� My heart sank
knowing that he knew my new name.�
�Master, what �..� the rest of my question was cut off� by a slap across my face.� My cheek was burning, as was my scalp where
he had held on tight while he had hit me. 

&nbsp;

This time my
tears fell down my face as he shook my head. �Slave, don�t test my
patience!�� Just then the phone rang,
making us both jump. �Are you expecting a call?�� I nodded, thinking it was properly my friend
wondering where I was. �Ok, but you have to make it fast and you are not going
anywhere tonight or tomorrow for that matter.� He picked up the phone and held
it to my ear. �Julie, sorry I won�t be able to make it tonight. I just got a
call that an old friend has had an accident and will have to go away for a
while.� It was so hard to not ask her to help me, but I didn�t dare.� �OK, I�ll see you soon, good luck tonight.�� 

&nbsp;

The phone was
removed from my ear and returned to its place. �Well done slave, I didn�t
realise you were such a good liar as well as an escape artist. Now, show me
where your bed is.�� My stomach flipped
as he pulled me up to my feet, my hair straining in his grip. I walked into my
room, standing just in the doorway.� A
push made me move forward and he knelt me down on the
floor again.� He left me kneeling while
he looked around the room, whether to see if I would try to get away or just to
keep me waiting, I wasn�t sure.� I did
think about running but knew I wouldn�t make it too far and then would only
make him have more reason to punish me. 

&nbsp;

�Stand up and come here.�� I did as he asked and moved to stand
nervously in front of him. When his hand came to rest on my top button, I
expected him to start to take my shirt off but he surprised me by moving his
hand to gently grip my chin and kiss me.�
It was a slow, lingering kiss and it made want to kiss him back, though
I fought the urge. I wished he would get on with my punishment and not make me
wait.� As he broke off the kiss I was
surprised to see some sadness in his eyes.�
He seemed to hesitate for a moment, something I had never seen him do
and sat me down beside him on the bed.� 

&nbsp;

�Slave, I need to ask you something. Was
your escape a spur of the moment thing or had you planned it?�� He sounded so different from his usual
confident self that I found myself telling him the truth without any thought to
what harm it might cause me. �I had planned it master.� I shrank away from him,
expecting him to react badly to my confession, but he just sat looking at his
hands. �Was it that awful to be with me?��
His question took me completely by surprise and I took a moment to think
about how he had treated me. �Master, I just couldn�t stand the thought of
belonging to someone. I saw how the other slaves almost revered you and just
never wanted to be like that.�� 

&nbsp;

He stood up and walked a few paces to the
wall and then turned to face me again.� I
was unsettled by his behaviour and slight curious too.� �What I want to know is all those months,
were you just pretending to be happy as my slave?�� For some reason, I felt ashamed of my actions
and could only nod.� �What about the
other slaves, were you pretending to like them too?� One of the things I had
missed about my time with Master William had been the company of the other
slaves. �Oh no Master, I really did like them, I wasn�t faking that.�� �I am pleased to hear that but you haven�t
yet answered my original question. Was I that awful to be with?��� 

&nbsp;

Knowing there would be no getting out of
answering him, I took a breath before I tried to explain what I felt for him.
�Master, there were times when you scared and hurt me but�. but I have to be
honest and say that there were times when I did get enjoyment out of being with
you.�� I couldn�t believe I was telling
him these things.� He came and sat beside
me again, his hand coming to rest on my knee.�
Flinching, he gripped me tighter, no so it hurt but enough to make me
stay still.� �Ok, I can accept that.� I was just so surprised by your escape
because you seemed to be settling in so well.�
You are very lucky I didn�t catch you sooner as I was extremely angry
with you for a long time. It was just blind luck that I saw an advertisement
for one of your shows and though you look different, your art is the same. Now,
it is time to deal with your punishment.�

&nbsp;

The old Master was back as he stood me up
and pulled my shirt open, the buttons flying around the room.� Gasping, I went to move back only to have my
legs hit the bed, causing me to fall back onto my tied arms. Master laughed and
pulled off my skirt and panties, holding me down with his body.� He didn�t give me a break as he pushed his
fingers into me a few times before flipping me over.� This at least took the pressure off my arms
but now I found my self with my hands being pulled up by a rope so they pointed
up to the ceiling. He spread my legs wide and I felt them being tied off to the
sides of the bed.� It was funny but
despite my fear of what he was going to do, part of me was thinking how he must
have spent some time getting the ropes in place before I had come home.

&nbsp;

My head was pulled up and I felt a gag
being pushed in, one with a ball attached to a band of leather.� He tightened the straps and I felt the ball
push in further, the band around my face making it impossible to push the ball
out. I tried not to panic; hating the way the gag constricted my breathing.� He lifted my face to the side to check the
gag, stroking my cheek with his fingers. �I know this is tight but you do
deserve it, also we don�t want any neighbours knocking on the door.�� I closed my eyes and he put my head down
facing away from him. �Slave, you are not to move your head until I say so.�� 

&nbsp;

I nodded and braced myself as I heard a
sound I knew well. The pain radiated through my left butt cheek, making me
scream behind the gag.� The right cheek
he hit just as hard and I understood why he had used such a restrictive
gag.� He rubbed his hand over my bottom,
before hitting me again three times on each cheek, harder then he had the first
time. I flinched as his hand rubbed my bottom again. �That was just the warm
up, slave.�� I clenched the cheeks of my
bottom, but of course he simply waited until I had to relax them to strike
again. For the next few minutes he continued to hit each butt cheek in turn,
almost hitting me as hard as Master Tony had done so long ago. By the time I
heard something drop onto the floor, I was crying and my bottom felt like it
was on fire. 

&nbsp;

I hoped my punishment was over but knew
that was just wishful thinking.� He
rubbed my sore bottom making me try recoil away and then moved his hands down
to my pussy.� His fingers started in my
pussy but then moved up to my asshole. �It was not the first time he had used my ass
but it had been a while now and I was not used to it.� Whimpering as he pushed his finger in, I
tried to move away from his probing digit.�
�Stay still slave. This is a punishment you have to take.� 

&nbsp;

His finger continued it�s probing, only
being removed to dip into my pussy to get more moisture. Eventually he got two
fingers in and then three, my asshole being made to stretch out wide.� I heard the sound of his zipper and then it
was his cock pressing against my hole and I was sure he was going to rip me
apart as he pushed into me.� It was the
first time he had not used any extra lubrication and I was in agony as he
forced his cock into me. I felt the head pop in and then a rush of flesh as his
cock wormed its way into me.� By this
time I was moaning constantly and tears covered my face. It made it hard to
breath and my head began to swim as his cock filled me completely, his balls
resting on my pussy.

&nbsp;

He stayed still for a moment, though it did
nothing to alleviate the pain.� I dreaded
him moving, knowing it would hurt like hell.�
When he did start to pull back, it was every bit a bad as I thought and
I screamed again behind the gag.� I felt
his fingers dip into my pussy again and when he pushed in, there seemed to be a
bit less friction. He must have put some of my cream on his cock and for that I
was extremely grateful.� Picking up
speed, he worked his cock in and out, the pain still bad but not so much as at
first. His fingers found my clit and began to rub it, his thrusts increasing
even more.� Despite the pain or maybe
because of it, I began to feel my orgasm approaching.� 

&nbsp;

His cock started to shudder in me and I
felt the first of his cum fill my ass as I began to cum under his clever
fingers. My body shook as he spurted more cum into me, his cock still filling
me until he was done.� When I recovered
from my own orgasm, I realised he had removed his cock but that I was still
restrained on the bed.� My shoulders were
starting to hurt and my ass both inside and out were on fire. I felt the gag
being undone and sighed as it came out, only to have him turn my head so that I
was facing him, or at least his cock.� 

&nbsp;

He pushed his cock against my lips and I
tried hard to ignore where it had been. Knowing what he wanted didn�t make it
any easier to do but I opened up and let him push his filth-covered cock into
me. I gagged at both the taste and the way he was pushing it into my
throat.� Figuring it was better to get it
over with, I used my tongue to lick the underside of
his cock as he pulled out again.� Then
using my mouth, I closed around the head, sucking and swallowing as much of the
foul substance as I could. He pushed back into my throat, remaining there until
I thought I would pass out. I tried to pull my head back but he had the back of
my head in his grasp. Pleading with my eyes, I gagged on his cock, spots
appearing before my eyes. Finally he pulled out, leaving me coughing and
gasping on the pillow.� 

&nbsp;

Once I had recovered and could breath again, he picked up the gag and held my head to
return it again. �Please Master, I wont ..� He didn�t
let me finish as he pushed the gag back in and turned to leave.� I grunted at him, shaking my arms and he
turned back to me.� Looking him in the
eye I again shook my arms. �So you want me to let your arms down? If I do, you
owe me, ok?� I nodded my head and he let them down so they were lying on my
back.� He left then and I heard the sound
of the shower running and then he must have gone into the kitchen.� Soon I could hear him opening and closing
cupboards and the sound of cooking. 

&nbsp;

As I lay there I wondered what would happen
now.� It was strange that he seemed in no
hurry to take me back to his house. Thinking about going back to life as a
slave made me feel helpless again and I struggled to get off the bed.� Just then the door opened and Master William
entered the room and sat down on the bed. Putting his hand gently onto my
bottom, the touch of his fingers made me jump, though the pain had eased
somewhat.� �I am going to let you up now,
so no nonsense ok?�� I nodded and he
released me from all of my bonds and then took off the gag.� He took my hand and led me into my own
kitchen, where I could see that he had some food ready for us.

&nbsp;

�I want us to be able to sit and eat, and
then we can talk about what will happen from here. Can I trust you to be
unrestrained?�� I had no desire to be
tied up and felt too tired to try anything. �Yes, I�ll be good.� I don�t want you to tie me up again.�� He smiled and rubbed my cheek, before sitting
me down at my own table. There was a cushion on the chair and it helped me to
be able to sit. I was surprised that while my bottom was tender it was not
aching like it had after Master Tony�s flogging.� It reminded me again of the difference
between the two men.� 

&nbsp;

We ate in silence, each of us seeming to be
occupied with our own thoughts. The food was good but I couldn�t eat much,
needing to know what he planned for me.�
�Not hungry?� Oh well, more for me
then.�� He took the rest of the steak off
my plate and I waited patiently while he finished eating.� I went to talk once but he held up his fork.
�No talking, just wait.�� 

&nbsp;

After he had finished, he made us both a
cup of coffee and we sat down in the lounge room. It would have seemed a normal
meal among two friends except for the fact that I was naked and he was
dressed.� I sipped my coffee and looked
at his man who again had control over me.�
Putting his cup down, he turned to me with a serious look on his face.
�We have a problem that I�m not sure what to do about.�� I played nervously with my coffee cup while
he continued to speak. �You have now become something of the minor celebrity,
so it makes it harder for you just to disappear again.� I had a flutter of hope
that he would leave me alone.� �However,
I�m not willing to let you go again.�� My
hope left me, making me feel that helpless feeling that I hated so much. I put
my head down and looked at my hands, only to find him leaning over to lift my
chin up again. �Hey, don�t worry, I think I have a
solution that will suit both of us.� 

&nbsp;

He let go of my chin and took another sip
of his coffee, making me wait yet again. �Please Master,
I can�t stand not knowing what you plan to do with me.� He put down his cup
again and stared at me, making me squirm in my seat. �Well slave, it really
depends on you. As I said, you are too well known to just take back and anyway,
I have the feeling you wouldn�t cope too well if I took you back to the
house.�� I looked at him in surprise, not
understanding why he was being so thoughtful.�
�Don�t look so surprised slave, it is obvious
to me that you are not cut out to be a full time slave. That and the problem of
you know being well known, means that I have an interesting solution to offer
to you.�� 

&nbsp;

Again he made me wait while he sipped his
coffee.� �Here is what I have in
mind.� You will stay here but be
available to me whenever I need you to be.� He sat back, obviously interested
in seeing my reaction.� �What do you
mean?� Are you saying that I can still
continue with my life but then I will have to still be your slave when you
say?� It sounded crazy but then it also meant I had a chance of living a near
normal life.� �Yes, that is right.� I suppose you are thinking that you could
just leave town when I go and never come back. Well I suppose you could but you
won�t. Do you want to know why?�� I
nodded. �Well, you told me yourself you cared for the other slaves, it would be
a shame if they had to be punished because of something you decided to do.� 

&nbsp;

I wanted to say, so what, but he knew that
I did care too much for them and worst still; I knew he would do it. Tears came
to my eyes, as I knew he had me trapped yet again.
�How will I know when you are coming, I mean, I need
to travel with my art sometimes.� He smiled, as my question told me I was going
to follow his plan. �I will let you know in advance when I am coming and we can
keep in touch via email.� By the way, I
was curious as to why you didn�t just go straight to the police when you got
away from me.�� 



�I just couldn�t stand the thought of
telling everyone what had happened to me. I just wanted to put it all behind
me.�� He put down his cup and leaned in
towards me again, making me have to fight the urge to move away from him.
�Well, I must say I was expecting to have the police knocking on my motel room
door, which is why I moved motels that night.�
You know, I am not surprised very often but you really did surprise me.
Now that I have found you again, I have to admit I was kind of impressed.�� I felt a strange sense of satisfaction, in
spite of the fact that he had found me again. �Of course, I don�t expect
anything like that to happen this time.��


&nbsp;

I knew that I would not try anything, not
wanting to put the other slaves at risk.�
He pulled me up to my feet and steered me into my room again. He allowed
me some time to use the bathroom before telling me what he wanted me to do.
�Lie on the bed, on your back, hands above your head.� I followed his
instructions and he pulled out even more rope from under the bed and tied my
hands to the top of my bed.� Wondering if
he intended to use my body or just sleep, I felt relieved when he undressed and
then lay down beside me. He gently squeezed my breast as I felt his hot breath
in my ear. I moaned as he pulled my head up and again kissed me tenderly.� 

&nbsp;

�Slave, it is good to have you back.� With
that thought in my head, he turned off the lamp and in a few minutes was
asleep.� His hand was still resting on my
breast and as I had no way of moving it, just tried to ignore it. I fell asleep
with the sound of his breathing in my ear and his fingers on my breast. The
next morning I woke to the sensation of his cock in my pussy, his hand coming
down to cover my mouth as he picked up speed. �Morning slave, hope you slept
well.� I had no way of answering him as he pounded away, my grunts the only
sounds I could make. He didn�t take long to cum, pulling out and spurting all
over my breasts.� He still had his hand
over my mouth as he recovered his breathing, only removing it to stand up and
go into the bathroom. 

&nbsp;

He left me tied up and his cum hardening on
my breasts while he had his shower.� It
gave me time to think about how my life would be with Master William back in
it.� I knew I should be grateful that he
had not been angrier with me or that he was at least letting me continue with
my art, but still I felt miserable that my independence would be lost.� I had just started to feel a sense of freedom
both in my art and in my life.� I hadn�t
realised that I had started to cry until I felt the tears on my face. He walked
back into the room just as I was trying to wipe them away. �Hey, what is
wrong?� Are you in pain?�� Again I wondered at the complexity of the man
and how he really did seem to care about the well being of his slaves.� 

&nbsp;

�No Master, I was � I was just thinking
about how my life will change again.�� He
sat down and wiped away my tears, before untying my arms and letting me sit up.
�I know, slave, that you will find it hard at first to get used to being my
slave again. I still am not sure myself if this arrangement will work, but I
hope it can. If not, I will just have to take you back with me.� This was
something I didn�t want. �No master, please give me a chance. I promise I will
not try to get away and will do whatever you say.� I really did mean every
word.� �Shh
slave, I know you will, it might just take some time
for us both to get used to this new situation.�
I have to go back this morning but will be back tomorrow night. If all
goes well, then we can continue. Now, I am ready for some food.�

&nbsp;

That was how I came to be kneeling at my
door, handcuffs on, waiting for my Master to enter the room. It had been a few
months now and though there were times when I had thought of just disappearing,
I never had.� The other slaves had all
sent me emails and I had even spoken to Gina on the phone and I knew I could
never put them in danger.� It was a
strange life, but at least I was free most of the time.� The door opened and I saw the feet of my
Master enter the room.� �Afternoon slave. Ready for some fun?�� I could only nod as once again I became slave
Jill, a slave in name and body, if not in mind.�
That part of me I still managed to keep for me
