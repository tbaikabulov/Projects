Runners Make the Best Ponygirls
Chapter 1: Taken 
32 minutes 55 seconds and 8 milliseconds. Her foot struck the pavement, the pain lancing up her nerves. The blister&#8217;s covering her left and right feet squished with each step. 32 minutes 55 seconds and 8 milliseconds, she repeated. Her mouth opened, with a great gasping inhale her chest expanded, oxygen filling her lungs. A half second later her nostrils flared as the air inside her chest rushed to escape. 32 minutes 55 seconds and 8 milliseconds, she mouthed. Her calves burned, sending jolts of pain with each step. Her shins felt like thousands of cracks were crisscrossing the bone, each new step creating more. She could feel her shoulders starting to cramp. Desperately she tried to move her arms to alleviate the pain. 32 minutes 55 seconds and 8 milliseconds, she hated those numbers. Strands of curly brown hair clung to the perspiration that covered her face. The hair began to itch, she tried to ignore it frustration gripping her. Why couldn&#8217;t she think of something else anything just not 32 minutes 55 seconds and 8 milliseconds�..
The song changed the deep sound of base and acoustics filled her ears. The sounds of a party mix had just started playing. She glanced down at her watch 28 minutes 13 seconds and 43 milliseconds. �huhaaa�.Fuck�hhuuu� the word forced out between breaths. She had not even rounded the last turn yet. Her last reserves of adrenaline rushed through her veins. The music pumping, her pace quickened. 32 minutes 55 seconds and 8 milliseconds, the time flashing across her subconscious. Heart racing, she felt her body shift gears. Her strides began to lengthen, her legs stretching to gain more ground. Her arms began to move in rhythm to her pace. She hit the corner at a full out sprint. 32 minutes 55 seconds and 8 milliseconds she began to chant the words as she flew down the path. 
She landed on the tips of her toes. Calf muscles absorbing the harsh impact, the jolting force running up her leg. Her quadriceps and calf flexing even as they absorbed the impact, driving her leg forward, her toes outstretched. 32 minutes 55 seconds and 8 milliseconds. Her shirt clung to her body soaked by perspiration. This was Ally&#8217;s favourite part of the run. Mouth dry, her throat raw and gasping as her body desperately tried to pump her muscles full of oxygen. The dull burn and ache had spread through her body, as her muscles reached their limits. 
She heard the last song on her playlist start. Greyhound by a group of Nordic DJ&#8217;s, she always thought the song suiting. It was in this moment that she experienced the euphoria of her runners high. When her muscles burned and she gasped for breath, the feeling would wash over her. She had tried explaining it to a friend once, �. but that had been difficult. Those who have felt it will know. Something you really have to experience. It was kind of like, the feeling of pushing yourself to the limit, until there&#8217;s nothing left in you to give. Until your drained and spent lying on the floor unable to move. That was runner&#8217;s high, and it felt well ��. Amazing, and that just doesn&#8217;t do it justice. 
Her feet barely touching the ground, she flew past the post. With great gasping breaths she desperately looked at her watch. 32 minutes 49 seconds and 57 milliseconds. She almost jumped for joy as she saw her time had improved by over 6 seconds! Ally practically skipped and pranced, through her cool down. Her tired muscles, and aches forgotten. Beaming from ear to ear she had finally beaten her time!&nbsp; 
The water was almost scalding, as she stepped under the spray. The steam rolled off the water. The condensation in the air was thick on her tongue as she drew a breath. The water hit her skin contouring and flowing in hundreds of streams. Dropping her head under the flow of water the sprinkling drops sending tingling sensations running down her spines. She could feel the pain and ache&#8217;s start to flow away as the hot water massaged her muscles. 
Her eyes firmly closed, her hand moved to grasp the showerhead. A desire stirred within her tired body. The sensations she felt changed as her hand began to play the water across her sore shoulders. Slowly methodically the pressure of the water worked the knots out of her shoulder muscles. With practiced ease her hand moved down to her chest, until the water began to caress her breasts. Her lips parted as the water played across the tender flesh. Ally could feel her heart rate quicken. She bit her lip as her free hand snaked upward. Its fingers began to grasp and massage her supple bosom. She could feel a tingling between her legs as she let out a low moan. The water moved down to fall across her tight and flat stomach. Her hand ran along her ribs until it roughly grasped a hold of her breast. The steam rising off the water had begun to cling to the walls of the bathroom. 
The water dripped down her stomach as the head reached her freshly shaven mons. Her mouth fell open a gasp escaping her lips. Her hand had finished its journey as the water fell against her nether lips. The hand teasing her breasts quickened its ministrations. A great surge of adrenaline rushed through her limbs as the water continued its massage. She heard herself moan, as the pressure increased between her legs. The warm water caressed her sore leg muscles before running down the drain. Her eyes fluttered open as her fingers began to tease her erect nipples. 
Fingers dug into her breasts, nails scraped along her sensitive skin. Her breath was coming in short gasps. Slowly her heals rose off the tiled floor, her muscles groaned in complaint. The showerhead was almost touching her lips now. The pounding water was sending pleasure tingling through her body. Ally could feel the perspiration forming on her skin. With a flick her finger sent an electric current though her sensitive nipple. The feeling sent shockwaves of bliss through her subconscious. 
Her hand growing tired adjusted its grip on showerhead and inadvertently changed the flows angle. The pounding flow hit her highly stimulated clit. She instantly felt light headed and dizzy. A great tidal wave rose through her body, starting from her fingers and toes. Muscles constricted her thighs quivering. Ally&#8217;s mouth dropped open in a wordless scream, eyes flying open. It was too much as thought turned into feral instinct, she submitted to the feelings that overwhelmed her. A wracking pleasure cursed through her frame. Her moans echoed against the tiled walls. Fingers sunk into tender breasts nails piercing skin. Body clenching as the explosion rocked through her. Legs threatened to buckle under the assault as her muscles spasms.&nbsp; 
She slowly got out of the shower. Every step placed carefully as her legs were still tender. A grin across her face, running always did make her so sensitive down there. Tight shorts digging into her with each stride, and yet people still asked her why she ran. A towel was needed to wipe away the steam that coated the mirror. Ally gazed into the mirror, her sky grey eyes staring back. She noted how her normally pale face had turned a healthy crimson. Ally liked the look it gave her cheeks a healthy glow. Although she thought were there more freckles on her face now? She giggled to herself at the thought. Turning she grabbed a towel and began to dry off her mane of flowing hazelnut locks. Ally took pride in her hair, right now though it looked pretty sad soaking wet hanging down to her waist. She finished drying and wrapped a towel around her chest, at 5&#8217;8� the towel reached just above her knees. 
The air in her apartment felt frigid on her skin as she walked out of the bathroom. Hmm maybe I took a tad bit too long in the shower she thought as steam billowed out of the bathroom. Going to the kitchen she poured herself a glass of water, her mouth was parched after such a prolonged shower. Idly she glanced at the mail, phone bill, heating bill, magazine interesting article about Arabian horses she noted. Happy 23rd birthday, well you&#8217;re only a month late she thought dryly as the card went in the trash. Taking the magazine and water she went back to her room.
The carpet felt wonderful against her sore feet. The blisters between her toes had finally stopped burning. I should probably use more baby powder to stop the friction she reflected. Her thoughts were interrupted as a sudden movement caught her eye. Before she could turn to look, a large hand grabbed her head. Large fingers twisted into her hair. With a powerful yank they pulled her head forcefully backward. It felt as if her hair was being ripped out of her skull. 
�Arggg� she managed to gasp out. Her mind had no time to process as she was suddenly thrust forward. All ready off balance she was unable to resist as she fell onto the bed. The towel that had been protecting her modesty dropped off her body leaving her stark naked. Ally instinctively twisted her head to protect her face. The movement sent fresh pain lancing though her nerves. With a crash she came to rest on her cheek. The hand continued to press downward, driving her face into the soft mattress. 
Quickly she was able to gather her senses. Ally filled her lungs to scream �HEEEEEL..uhh�.mmpm.� Her scream was cut off as her chest and lungs collapsed. Pain shot though her spine as a sharp knee dug into her back pinning her to the bed. She could feel the full crushing weight behind the knee settle onto her spine. It was like being punched in the gut, unable to draw a breath she lay on the bed gasping for air. The pain was excruciating, it felt as if thousands of knives were being driven into her back. Her lungs had been compressed almost flat against her ribs. 
Above her a voice spoke �I hate it when they scream, it makes things so much harder than it has to be.� Ally stopped her struggles, her ears prickling at the deep male voice. With a low gasping wheeze she was forced to listen. �Now if you behave and promise not to scream, I will take some pressure off your back. Now nod if you understand.� Between the pain and her desperation to breathe she had little choice. Starting to go red in the face, she managed a slight nod.
With a great rattling gasp she was able to draw breath. Ally desperately sucked down the sweet oxygen with gasping breaths. The knee had slightly lifted, although it still pressed her stomach into the mattress. �Good girl, now I am going to let go of your hair. If you try to scream....� the pain returned as he ground his knee into her back �Got it?� With fresh tears streaking down her face she gave another nod. The pressure on her hair was released as the hand was removed. 
Seizing her chance Ally did not hesitate �HHHEEEELLLLLLLPPPPPPPPP MMEEEEE� Her lungs burned with the effort. 
�Stupid Fucking Bitch� The pain she had felt before was nothing to what she experienced now. Her body was forced into the mattress. The knee pressed down, now his full weight behind it. The mattress gave way around her as she sunk into its cushion. With fear and pain Ally realized he had been holding back before, now he unleashed his full fury. The hand roughly grabbed her hair. With a rip backwards her head was pulled roughly off the mattress. If she hadn&#8217;t lost some hairs before she certainly had now. A wracking sob of pain trembled through her body. Ally&#8217;s face streaked with tears her eyes puffy, was held aloft in the air by his grip on her hair. She desperately tried to alleviate the pain on her scalp, by moving her head back as much as possible. Straining her neck backward until her eyes stared up at the ceiling. 
Her eyes forced open, her mouth parted as she still struggled to breath. Each slow gasping breath sent a tremble through her little frame. Suddenly Ally felt an object roughly forced between her parted lips. All resistance gone she was forced to slowly open her mouth to accept the intruder. The object sent a new wave of panic running through her. It&#8217;s too big she thought what is he doing to me! Her jaw was stretched open as finally with a pop the red ball gag was forced behind her teeth. The ball was brutally driven further into her mouth as a strap was cruelly tightened around her head. As she tried adjusting to the large gag now stretching her mouth, her world went black. A blindfold was neatly knotted around her head. With terror Ally realized that he had just rendered her mute and blind. The hand holding her hair abruptly released its grip. Ally&#8217;s head fell back onto the mattress. The realization sent a tremor of fear through her body. 
Unable to hold back fresh tears began to slip around the blindfold. Wet spots began to darken the sheets. She felt the weight crushing her shift. Strong hands grabbed her wrists from where they lay useless on the bed. Pain shot through her shoulders as the hands roughly dragged her arms behind her back. Cold metal was placed against her skin. She felt the cuff dig into her wrist as it was cruelly ratcheted closed. Her other wrist was soon trapped as well. He let her hands wall limply against her back. A moan escaped around the ball gag as she shook her arms uselessly. The firm steel keeping her hands locked together.&nbsp; 
Only when her hands were firmly bound, was the pressure on her back relieved. So desperate was she to breathe, the man had already closed one cuff around her leg before she even noticed. With desperation Ally kicked out with her still free leg. She was determined to hurt her hated attacker. To her disappointment her foot did not connect, and it continued to flail through the air. With a gasping breath her oxygen deprived muscles soon gave out. With shame her limp leg settled back on the bed in defeat. It was then that she felt her leg dragged outward. With no power to stop it the second cuff soon wrapped around her ankle. Ally was forced to lie on the bed as he worked. Drool had begun to escape past her gag, slowly adding to the soaked sheets beneath her face. The man finished what he was doing to her legs. A slap on her thigh made her instinctively flex her legs. With horror Ally realized she could no longer press her thighs together. Her legs held apart by spreader bar attached to the cuffs. 
The feeling of losing all control of her limbs was too much for her. She thrashed on the bed bouncing up and down. The man stood watching his prize. Content in the knowledge she would be much easier to control if he let her wear herself out. With her mouth gagged, she was soon gasping for air. Slowly her thrashing began to lessen until she stopped. Lying on the bed, Ally was forced to suck air through her nose the unyielding gag preventing her from drawing full breaths. The sound of her laboured breathing filled the room. As she lay there it dawned on her for the first time how wet her cheek was. The sheets were now soaked in her tears and the drool that escaped around the bitter ball gag. Slowly her breathing began to ease before returning to normal. A silence filled the room for the first time since the assault began. The ability to move and to see having been taken from her she was forced to lie on the bed listening. The ominous silence filled the room. Ally&#8217;s heart was threatening to jump out of her chest. Every sound sent new visions of horror racing through her mind. It was worse than when he was on top of her. At least then she knew where he was. 
A hand brushed across her naked thighs. �Mhhhmmm� She desperately tried to shout at her captor. Her protests did little to stop the hand returning. Fingers slowly traced up her calve along the back of her thigh until pulling away. 
�Let&#8217;s see what I caught.� The voice sounded loudly in her sensitive ears. Large hands easily rolled her over. The movement made Ally flail as she moved through the air roughly landing on her back. �Well aren&#8217;t you quite the catch� his finger continued its journey. Starting at her stomach it began to run upward. Tracing her ribs she could feel it begin to circle her chest.
 �mhpppmmm� Ally desperately tried to get him to stop molesting her. 
�I know girl, it feels good doesn&#8217;t it?� he emphasised his point by giving her nipple a flick. 
�NNhhhmm� Ally responded with a sob. 
The fingers continued to play with her nipples. She was powerless to stop her breasts reaction to his attention though. Already sensitive from her playtime in the shower they were quick to react. His fingers only stopped when both nipples were hard. Ally&#8217;s red eyes began to moisten again as slow sobs escaped around the ball gag. �Shhhh, don&#8217;t cry baby girl, daddy&#8217;s here.� He whispered into her ear. He brought his hand up to her face. Ally hated her body for responding to the mans unwanted touch. She felt him brush back some curls of her hair that had become plastered to her wet cheek. Her sobs slowly stopped as his hand stroked her cheek. �That&#8217;s better girl. See if you behave I can make this better for you.� Ally tried to yell a verbal onslaught of insults at him, but the ball gag stopped her protests. All that he heard was moaning. �See I knew you would want the hard way in the end, honey.�
She felt the bed move as he shifted his weight on it. His fingers returned to her stomach. Her arms were beginning to go numb as they cruelly were pressed into her back. The hard steel that enclosed them was forced into her spine. The fingers began to move down circling her belly button. �mmhhdnnnttt� she cried desperately around the gag. They moved over her sensitive mons before they stopped. Ally&#8217;s mind was going crazy. This stranger was sending spikes of pleasure through her body already. Unable to stop herself she let out another moan. She felt fingernails start to slowly work their way up the insides of her thighs. Slowly tracing the contours of her toned legs, he stroked ever closer to his goal. Her mind was trying desperately to fight her body. But it was a losing battle. His fingers continued to tease just out of reach of their target.
�I see your enjoying yourself. Such a naughty girl you are honey.� He said teasing with his fingers. Getting so close but drawing away at the last second. The wetness between her legs made her cheeks crimson in colour. 
With a suddenness that took her breathe away his fingers found their mark. She felt the finger slip between her lips. Slowly it started to tease its way deeper. Her muscles contracted around the intruder. As it moved further inward stroking her walls, a groan of pleasure escaped her lips. She gasped as finally his knuckles pressed against her opening. A lusty moan was elicited from her as his finger curled and rubbed along as it slowly withdrew. Ally was an emotional wreck, the pain in her arms long forgotten. If it wasn&#8217;t for the gag between her lips she would be unable to keep back her obvious pleasure. Slowly she felt the finger inserted again. This continued assault was kept up bringing the girl new heights of pleasure for what seemed like hours to her. A second finger joined the first before finally being joined by a third. Each sending her to new heights of pleasure and frustration as they teased her until she trembled with lust, and groaned with each new thrust.
Ally&#8217;s mind was totally consumed by the feelings of pleasure between her legs. Each slow movement of the fingers brought a muffled sound of pleasure. Her nostril flared as her breathing had turned to short rapid breaths. Arms strained against their bondage, in desperation to achieve release. Her toes curled and released in rhythm. Legs strained against the spreader bar that held them. �mhmmmm� She moaned at him.
�What&#8217;s that girl, do you need something?� his fingers started their slow journey. 
�uhuhhuhhh� she groaned. He pressed his fingernails lightly against her as he withdrew. Fireworks seemed to explode in her mind. �PEESSSE!!!� She desperately tried to form the word.&nbsp; 
�That&#8217;s my girl, and since you asked so nicely.� She felt his fingers leave her now soaked legs. Her thighs coated in her juice. 
�nnnhhh� the moan was needy with lust. Despite all that had happened and the bondage that restrained her Ally was furious that his hands had stopped. She lay on the bed consumed in heat, her hands strained against their cuffs as fingers desperately tried to reach her sex. The only warning she felt was the mattress shift as he repositioned himself. She twisted her head at the sound of a hand coming to rest on the bed next to her ear. Suddenly his voice was in her ear, his mouth inches away 
�Enjoy it Bitch, who knows it could be your last fuck.� The words sent goose bumps over her body. 
With a slow thrust he began to enter her. She felt him slip easily past her soaked lips. Her abs began to contract as he slowly entered. Her walls clung to his length, trying desperately to stop the movements sending shocks though her nerves. Her back began to lift off the bed arching as he continued to drive forward. A low savage groan rocked her body, forced out of her mouth. Her mind was rocking in waves of pleasure, each inch he slid in sending fresh joy. She began to worry as the pressure continued unrelenting. Inch by inch he forced his way inside her. Concern crossed her mind would it stop before it completely filled her? It seemed that she truly would be thrust apart. Just as Ally felt her body could take no more he stopped. She let out a final guttural groan as his hips ground against hers. 
He paused, sunk up to his hips inside her. Ally&#8217;s muscles twitched and contracted around his shaft, each movement sending fresh bliss through her. She let out another groan as he shifted his weight finding a better position. She felt so full, it felt like he was up against her womb. Suddenly she felt his large hand wrap around her neck. �Remember bitch enjoy it� he chuckled to himself. The fingers around her neck began to tighten. At the same time he began to withdraw from inside her. 
�Mhhmm� Ally moaned as he fully withdrew. The pressure around her neck was slowly increasing. Given no time to think her lips parted as he slowly entered again. His thrusts became rhythmic, slowly he would enter until his pelvis rested against hers. Then he would withdraw, slowly but surely the time between thrusts decreased. All the while his fingers continued to tighten their grip.
Ally was finding it harder to breathe now. Between the ball gag in her mouth and his hands slow constriction her breath was becoming shorter. His thrust&#8217;s inside her was sending pleasure shooting through her nerves though distracting from her discomfort. His pace was quickening. Ally could feel her walls hugging his length as it moved in and out. She felt a head rush as the blood was trapped by his hands grip. Despite herself she could feel the pleasure between her legs 
�That&#8217;s it bitch keep on squeezing my cock. Don&#8217;t let a little thing like not being able to breathe stop you.� Her body was coated in a sheen of sweet. Ally began to arch her back, as his hand around her neck held her aloft.
Each breath was now a struggle. Her nostrils were flaring desperate to suck in air that her lungs so desperately needed. His fingers curled around her neck. The lack of oxygen was beginning to affect her thinking. Things began to slow for Ally. His rhythm had increased to a fevered pitch but for Ally each thrust seemed to last minutes. While each desperate breath seemed longer and longer apart. �Almost over girl just a little more.� He managed to mutter between thrusts. She had stopped crying now, the drool continued to dribble down her cheeks.
She snorted in a desperate attempt to draw breath. Her heart rate seemed to slow. Her mind seemed heightened to his member&#8217;s movement. She could feel every inch of him slid along her walls. Each time his pelvis was pressed against hers it sent spasms running through her. His hand was now holding her neck in a tight embrace. Her chest contracted as it frantically tried to draw breath. Ally&#8217;s mind had started to cloud over, the blackness threatening to envelop her. With a final thrust he sank up to the hilt inside her. Ally was rocked by the pleasure of release as her body convulsed. Her hands curled into fists, nails digging into flesh. Waves of bliss broke against her. Her legs kicked against their bounds. Her climax seemed heightened, a new found level of joy. As she came down from her orgasm, she felt his release inside her. His warm seed mixed with her own release filling her fully.
His hand slowly released her neck, allowing her to collapse back onto the bed. It felt like someone had shocked her heart. Her back arched as her nostrils sucked in a great draught of air. With laboured breaths she cleared away the blackness that hung over her mind. Slowly after several minutes she was able to get her breathing under control. She moaned as her walls clung to him as he withdrew from within her. A feeling of euphoria had settled on Ally from the oxygen high she now felt. The slow warm dribble of seed leaked down her opening to puddle on the bed.
Slowly large hands lifted her head. The pressure on her mouth was released as the straps attached to the ball gag were unclipped. Hands gently slipped the large ball past her lips. Fresh tears almost sprang forth at the pain. Slowly moving her jaw she winced at the cramps in her muscles. Light flooded back into her eyes as the blind fold was removed. Squinting from the bright light, she gazed up at her attacker for the first time. A smile spread across her lips. 
�Hello Ally� Brian said. Her boyfriend standing over her was grinning from ear to ear.

Chapter 2: Displayed
The warmth of the suns early morning rays began to fill the still and silent bedroom apartment. The first slivers of light slowly made their way across the tangled sheets of the bed. Ally's eyes fluttered open as the bright light fell upon her face. A smile spread across her lips, as she stretched. She gave a satisfying yawn as she slowly uncurled her fingers and toes. Her hand fell to her chest, where strong hands held her in a tight embrace. The warmth of Brian's chest pressed up against her back. Memories of the previous night filled her mind as her small nimble fingers began to stroke along his powerful arms. She shuddered as she remembered how his hands had wrapped about her neck. Her own pleasure heightened by the power of his grip. She lay there basking in the morning light, while dirty thoughts danced through her mind. It was only the sudden deep rumbling of her awakening bed mate that brought her back to the present.&nbsp; 
"Morning sweetie" Brian said his warm lips planting a kiss upon her bare shoulder. She could feel his arms tighten around her as his muscular arms flexed. To her delight his muscles weren&#8217;t the only thing that Ally felt. The familiar press of his hardening member grazed across her still sensitive lower lips. She shuddered at the intimate touch. Neither one of them had ever made it a habit to wear clothes to bed, a fact that Brian often took advantage of. Of course Ally was never really one to discourage him, even if it did mean many a late morning. 
"I got you a present" he said propping himself up onto his elbow. "It's on the night stand" he pointed, his hand then falling to stroke along her slender arm.
Ally was disappointed to feel the heat of his member disappear as he moved behind her. She was half tempted to turn around and finish what he had teased her with. But the mention of a present drew her attention. 
"Aww, Brian you didn't have to get me anything." Sitting up she let the covers fall around her. Her naked form revealed to all. Reaching over she took a hold of the gift. It was a leather bound case, like one that you would get from a jeweller when buying an expensive necklace. "Oh Brian" she gasped as the lid came open, her face a mask of surprise.
His hand brushed aside her long locks of unkempt hair, revealing her bare neck beneath. His lips left warm wet kisses as they moved from her shoulder to the crook of her neck. The pull of his lips upon her neck made Ally gasp in pleasure, her breath catching in her throat. Ally felt her body leaning toward him on its own accord, her eyes pressed closed as the eternal bliss danced through her. When his lips finally parted he had left his mark upon her neck, the small red love spot visible against her skin. Without a word he reached over to the open case she still held in her hands.
The leather felt cool against her skin as he wrapped the collar about her neck. She inhaled sharply as strong hands pulled the leather end though the shining metal buckle, that now rested beneath her chin. He continued to pull until sliding the hook through the very last hole. She gasped at collar's tight embrace. The supple leather pressing deeply into her skin, ensuring she would not forget its presence. Ally doubted she could fit even one finger between skin and collar. Each breath felt just a bit harder now, like breathing inside a dry sauna. But for some reason it just felt right. 
"Oh Brian it's�. it's beautiful." Ally was gazing into her wardrobes mirror. Her finger running along where the collar met her neck. It was a deep chocolate brown colour, with a stainless steel buckle, and D ring at its front.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"I thought you might like it" his hands came to rest on her shoulders. "You know what this means though?" He said with a grin.
Ally and Brian had long talked about the nature of their relationship. While they did all the things other couples did cuddling on the couch, or hanging out with friends. There was something deeper between the two of them, something different than your average couple. Brian was the first man that had shown her that there was more to love then just words. At first she had been nervous, for no boyfriend had ever treated her to such passion in the bedroom. Brian was a caring teacher though, both comforting and strict. Looking back those early days of her introduction to bondage and submission they seemed so tame. But they did not last long she thought with a smile. For he always knew when to push her, to make her break through her own comfort zone. Brian had shown her the passion and emotion involved when you give yourself up to another mind, body, and spirit. 
Ally realized with time that these new feelings that burned within her now were not new. They had been inside her all along. Brian had simple shown her that she did not have to hide her true self. It was so clear now. 
She needed someone to bend her to their will, to strip her of all dignity. She wanted a man that would not only love her but also to use her. Looking back she knew why no boyfriends had ever been able to satisfy her burning desire. They had been too soft not willing to give her what she wanted. For Ally wanted it rough, to have the will of another forced on her. But above 
all it needed to be real, not the playful games of a shy couple but the gritty reality of a true power struggle. Brian gave her these things he was her dominant and she was his submissive. Ally knew she could never go back.
Of course one must remember nothing in life is ever so black and white. Nor are all subs meek, and submit willingly, sometimes one must be trained, before they submit to the will of their master.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Ally dragged her eyes away from the mirror to look back at him. She was biting her lip nervously, as she stared up into his golden hazel eyes. "You have claimed me as your own, master?" Her throat had gone dry, her breathing shallow. "To do with as you wish?" Her words a whisper.
"Yes my little pet" he took a deep breath of her hair before lightly kissing her atop her head. "To do with as I please."&nbsp;&nbsp; 
He picked her up like she was nothing more than a feather, his arms bulging as his fingers clamped around her arms. Ally was only able to let out a short yelp before she found herself pressed face first into the mattress of their bed. Her arms were roughly yanked behind her back. The joints in her shoulders straining as he pressed her arms together, her left hand being forced against her right elbow, and her right hand against her left elbow. One massive hand was all it took to hold her arms together as they were roughly held against her back, while his other hand began to tightly loop the first strands of rope about her forearms.
Ally could already feel the loss of her arms to the tight press of the rope, before she had even had time to recover from having the wind knocked out. Craning her neck to the side she was able to turn her face, so that her mouth was off the mattress. "HELP MEEEEEE!" she screamed the words echoing around the small confines of the apartment. The walls however were made of poured concrete blocks and had been touted as soundproof by the builder. No help would be coming for Ally today.
"Fucking Bitch" Brian growled at her. He lifted the now bound girl effortlessly, forcing her into a sitting position facing him. Ally did not see the hand coming, the stinging slap taking her completely unawares. Her cheek was quickly turning ruby red. "If you fucking talk again, I will give you more than just that love tap." He said with a finger pointing threateningly at her face. Dazed and trying to blink back tears, the threat and throbbing pain was enough to ensure she went quickly quiet, except for the sniffing of her nose. "What I thought" he said lowering his finger.
The rope began to wrap its way around her chest now, its length passing around her body, trapping her arms tightly to her back. He made sure to tuck each wrap of the rope tightly under her breasts, so that the rope seemed to disappear beneath the flesh of her bosom. The cruel tying of her body was only surpassed when he wrapped a length of rope over the top of her breasts before tying it tightly to the rope passing beneath. This had the effect of trapping her supple mounds in a rigid embrace. 
"Why are you doing this to me?" Ally cried pitifully to Brian. "Haven't I been a good girl?" She looked up at Brian her eyes wide in fear.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"I said quiet Bitch!" Brian emphasized his command with a forceful tug of the rope, the rough rope painfully rubbing against Ally's soft skin causing her to whimper. "You forget you place girl" he growled. "That collar means you're my property now, and I do what I want with my property." 
If breathing had been hard before with just the collar wrapped around her neck, it was now downright impossible. Each time she inhaled her expanding chest would cause the rope encircling her chest to dig deeply into her skin. It felt as if her lungs could barely expand. While her breasts felt heavy as the ropes restricted circulation, her tender mounds filling with blood, so much so that her nipples were already hard to the touch. 
"It's too tight" she moaned. "Please sir", huh she gasped "loosen it." She was panting from the effort of speaking.
She yelped in pain, her scream echoing around the walls of the apartment. His fingers continued to twist the sensitive flesh of her nipples. "What did I tell you about talking girl?"
"Not�. not TOOOOO!!!" she yelled the last word as he finished painfully twisting her nipples. She moaned out as he let it go. 
"Don't let me hear you talking again Slut, unless you want to feel more pain." He swatted one of her breasts with the back of his hand, causing Ally to groan in discomfort but otherwise remaining silent. 
"Now stretch out your legs" Brian commanded her. It was a task easier said than done. With her arms now trapped, held tightly against her back she struggled to keep her balance as she slipped her legs out from under her firm bottom. He began to slide first a pair of stripped knee high socks over each leg before placing a pair of high heels onto her feet. These were not your everyday heels though. They had been dubbed her pair of toe crushers by her girlfriends. Dark red in colour they are platform heels that add 8 inches to her height. So extreme are they that each requires a large strap wrapped around her ankle just to ensure they don&#8217;t fall off. They also had the unpleasant effect of forcing the majority of her weight on to the very tips of her toes something Ally now experienced as Brian pulled her unwilling by the D ring of her collar onto her feet.
"Hmm, I always liked the look of a girl in heels" Brian said his eyes drinking in her beauty. "Especially one with legs like yours girly" he said while he finished gazing luridly at her body. She trembled not only because of her unsteady feet but because he was now kneeling running his rough hands over her supple calves. Her breathing was short and panicky as his fingers crawled up her inner thigh. She gasped in terror, as the very tips of his nails brushed against her sensitive outer lips.
"GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME YOU ANIMAL!" she screamed at him, one of her legs shot out to kick him. That though was a mistake. Already unsteady on her heels, Brian very easily grabbed her leg yanking her toward him. Without her arms to balance her Ally was sure to fall if he so much as twisted her leg. 
"That was your last mistake Bitch" he said quickly dropping her leg, but before she could recover and make a run for it he was already back on his feet. Ally cried out in pain as his hand grasped a handful of her hazelnut locks. His fingers entwined deeply into her hair yanking her head back so that her eyes and face were now turned upward, staring at the ceiling. His face loomed into her limited vision, those golden eyes staring down at her with contempt. "I gave you a chance, and you spat in my face, now you don't have a choice. Open wide girl!"
"No� AHhahaha� ghgghmhmmm" Ally tried to slam her teeth shut to prevent whatever horror he had planned next for her. But it did little good. With another hard yank of her hair, the girl's mouth flew open in a cry of pain. Only to be cut short by the bit gag forced between her teeth. Ally tried to fight it but without the use of her hands she could do little but grind her teeth into the hard rubber bit now lodged between her teeth. Her moans of protests went unheeded as Brian strapped the gag tightly in place behind her neck. 
The pain of her scalp was soon forgotten as her released his grip on her hair. "Isn't that better girly. Now just be nice and quiet while I fix your hair" Brian cooed to the helpless girl. He began to brush out her flowing locks, taking his time to remove all the snags and snarls until her hair shone bright and straight. He tied it back in a tight ponytail with a flowing pink ribbon. "There now you have proper mane" he said patting her, on top of her head. Ally could only glare at him, in silent loathing. 
Ally was confused by his comment about her hair. A mane, what was he talking about? She was not allowed to idly speculate for long as soon enough the next part of her 'dress' was presented to her. It wasn't much just a couple of thin straps that roughly resembled the shape of a pair of panties, except without the fabric in between. But that was not what had caused Ally's eyes to fly open in surprise. Mounted along the central strap were two very scary looking protrusions. There was a very large and scary looking dildo that must have been at least 7 inches with ample girth to boot. Behind it sat what she could only surmise was a butt plug. Shaped like a cone it was much shorter but no less wide then the dildo with a flared base at its bottom. 
"Easy girl, don't look so frightened, they aren&#8217;t that big." It was true Brian was not so small where it counted, but that being said she had never had anything more than an exploring thumb between her clenched cheeks, and that had been enough for her. Ally was breathing hard now, not only because of the rope compressing her chest but also because of the growing unease within her.
"Easy girl, that&#8217;s it relax, be a good girl and this will all be much easier for you to get used to" Brian said trying to sooth her as she took a couple awkward paces back from him. It was much too late to try and escape now though. With one hand grasping one of the bit gags ring that sat upon her cheek he guided her forward into position. Ally could feel her stomach doing back flips as Brian guided her feet into their place between the straps. Her heart was racing as the head of the dildo began to part her glistening lips. She moaned involuntarily as its head slid past her already glistening outer lips, and began to bump and rub along her clenching walls, sending sparks of bliss through her body as it buried its way deep inside her. Ally's pleasure was soon forgotten as the tip of the squat ugly butt plug pressed against her tightly clenched rosebud, the slick lubricant teasing at her entrance. She groaned loudly her teeth gnashing into the bit gag as her bottom was slowly forced open. 
"That&#8217;s it easy girl, be good now and don't fight it" Brian cooed to her, one hand around her thigh holding her in place. Ally's muscles tightened around the twin intruders. Her body pressing against them, so that each bump and scrape was heightened sending thrills racing through her body. 
"Now be a good girl and push, that&#8217;s it push girl, move those hips." Ally was so confused her body was wracked with pain and pleasure both mixing together to overwhelm her senses. In that moment she had no control over her actions all rational thoughts having fled her mind, only her base instincts were left only her primal need. Panting loudly around the bit gag she pushed down, impaling herself on the twin intruders. Ally threw her head back in a silent scream of ecstasy as both plugs disappeared inside her.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"You must get off on this don't you girl?" He said while tightening the crotch straps firmly in place about her hips. "Such a dirty little slut you are girl" he said, his hand rubbing her flat stomach. "Hmm, I can almost feel them pressing against your belly girl" he said with a smirk. Ally could only give a deep moan of lusting need as she felt his hand pushing her insides against the silicone member hidden deep within her body. 
Ally could no longer voice her opposition. Gagged, bound, and now violated she could only hang her head in shame. With eyes downcast at the ground she did not see him approach with leash in hand. Nor did she look up with the loud click of him snapping it to her collars D ring. Only when he gave a sharp tug of her leash did she dare to look into the face of the man who had done this to her. "Come along girl, you going to be late for your show" he said with a smirk. 
Ally could only stumble along behind him as he led her out of the bedroom and into the apartment proper. Her thoughts were all jumbled, Brian had never bound her like this before, and what show was he talking about? Ally could not ponder long on these thoughts as soon she found herself looking down again, not out of fear but rather to try and keep from falling. It was like she was walking on stilts. Each step threatening to topple her over, and with no hands to break her fall that was a very scary prospect indeed. So it was she did not notice where he was leading her until she very nearly ran into him. Ally was not pleased with the scene before her. 
Brian had led her into the guest bedroom that she had turned into her personal exercise room. It was a modest affair with a small range of free weights and a bench or two, but it was what was in the centre of the room that had sent a cold sweat coursing down her back. It was her pride and joy. She had spent countless hours researching the make and model until she had found the best treadmill she could afford. It had 32 different exercise routines, hill climb, remote control, television, guided tours, you name it had it. Ally knew what Brian had planned even before he gave a hard yank on her collar. 
"Up girl, come on step up!" he tugged at her leash, trying to coax her onto the treadmills running surface. She stood steadfast refusing to move from her spot. He soon lost patience with her "Fucking bitch" he growled. His hands dug into her still sensitive breasts, fingers painfully pressing into flesh. It was too much for Ally her protests faltered as he dragged her forward by the tender flesh of her breasts. Ally was trying to blink back tears as Brian wrapped her leash around the central grip of the treadmill. He made sure to leave only enough slack so that she could stand halfway along the belt before feeling the faint pull of the lead. She would not be able to step off the track and a tight knot ensured no chance of escape without the use of her bound hands.
"See not too bad girl, just a little run is all" Brian said grinning at her. The concern was written across her face, her eyes wide and staring at him in fear. She tried to plead with him, to tell him that she would do anything that he desired, just don't make her do this. Instead all that Brian heard was some half formed mumbled words. 
"Plzzz�. Bian�nhnnn" She could not speak properly with her tongue still trapped beneath the bit gag. 
"That reminds me" he bent down behind her, the leash preventing her from turning her head to see. She felt something heavy being attached to the plug buried within her butt. When Brian stood back up she felt something soft brush against her thighs and bottom. "You can't be a ponygirl without your tail!" he chuckled. 
A tail! He had put a tail on her! Why would he want her to wear a tail and what the hell was a ponygirl? Her thoughts were interrupted as she watched Brian pull out a metal tripod positioning it off to the side of the treadmill. Then she saw him mount a digital video camera onto it, adjusting it just right so that it pointed directly at her. She watched with bated breath as he pushed the power button and the little red indicator came on. A thousand different scenarios raced through her head, cameras had never been part of their games before. For the first time since he had wrapped the collar around her neck Ally was truly scared. 
All smiles Brian walked back over to the treadmill, ignoring the now hyperventilating girl. He began to push some buttons on the treadmills display, setting the details of the workout routine. Ally desperately tried to see what he was entering but he made sure to use his body to block the details from her view. When he was done he turned to her, eyes fixating on hers. "Now I know what you're thinking, but I can't have you not in your best shape" he said while brushing the hair out of her eyes. "I want you to really enjoy this workout, because remember it's not just for you it's also for all our online viewers." He said as he gently turned her head so that she was looking right at the camera. 
Ally felt the wind go out her, as a cold terror seized her. Brian had pushed her to her limits before but this, this was different. What they had was private a personal trust between just the two of them. The man that she loved had in that moment betrayed her. Ally had placed her trust in him, giving up not just her free will but also her love and affection. But now he was sharing what had been a special intimate part of their relationship with complete strangers. Tears began to run freely down her rosy red cheeks. She wanted nothing more at that moment but to curl up into a ball and to close her eyes and wish all of this away.&nbsp; 
"There, there little ponygirl, it's okay no need to cry" Brian's tone was soft as his gentle hands brushed tears from her face. "I just thought the world deserved to see such a pretty pony such as you. I'm just so proud of you, and wanted to show you off is all." He now kissed her cheek. "Besides there are only a few viewers at the moment�. ahhh okay maybe more than a few" He said looking a little shocked as he glanced at his phone. Ally looked up at him anger in her eyes. Brian put his hands up in the air. "Who would have thought 187 people would have nothing better to do on a Sunday morning? Wait make that 204�.238 wow this is climbing really fast." 
She tried to scream at him, to tell him to go fuck himself, that she was through with him, and that it was over between them. But all that Brian could hear with the bit gag wedged in her mouth was angry mumbling and snorting. Ally could only glare at him, while she imagined all the things she would be doing to him if her hands were not trapped behind her.&nbsp; 
"You better wipe that look off your face now Bitch." He said pointing at her angrily "Or maybe I will start you off at a full out sprint?" In that moment she was unable to stand the sight of him. Ally turned to stare at the wall behind him. 
"Fine be that way, but just remember to keep your footing we wouldn't want you falling in front of all these viewers now would we? Especially with this leash so tight" He said with a smirk on his face, as his finger sent the taunt leather vibrating with a flick. "So don&#8217;t disappoint them or me. I want to be able to make a lot more money off of people viewing you before you give up." Suddenly her anger dissipated as she watched in fear as he pressed the large start button on the treadmills console. "So get that ass moving little pony." He commanded. Ally yelped in pain and surprise as his palm gave her bottom a stinging slap that sent her stepping forward. 
He turned to walk away but at the last second faced her again. "I forgot to mention I have to run to class for a couple hours. But don't worry I'll be watching your progress on my phone. I can pick up the stream right in my browser, pretty neat eh." With that he walked out of the room, his footsteps echoing down the hall. Ally listened to the jingle of his keys, and the opening of the front door followed by the lock turned shut. 
As the belt began to turn beneath her the situation she now found herself in quickly sank in. He had left her, he had actually left. Her fears about being naked and bound in front of hundreds of strangers no longer seemed to matter. Brian had tied her leash to the treadmills handle, he must know�. He has to know, that if she were to fall now�� 
Ally couldn't handle it all. What had started off as a lazy Sunday morning filled with a romantic game between lovers filled with passion and pleasure had divulged into something sinister. This was no longer a game. Brian had humiliated, and degraded her before the eyes of hundreds of strangers. She felt like an animal being used only for the twisted pleasure of others. But worst of all, the thing that hurt the most was that he had left her.
It only took a second of not paying attention to where she was stepping before she quickly felt the collar begin to tighten about her neck. Like a vice it cinched the leather tight, causing her to gasp for air. Only a series of quick panicky steps helped to loosen the collars grip. Slowly she settled in, trying to focus all of her attention placing one unsteady foot after the other. Each step caused the plugs buried deep within her to jostle and move, despite her best efforts to not further degrade herself in front of the camera Ally was unable to help the occasionally moan from escaping past her gag. She could also do little to stop her tail from swinging back and worth. The silky strands brushing against her thighs sending tingles of pleasure across her skin. 
The first 20 minutes were painful but bearable. Ally was a long distance runner. She ran every day and had the toned legs to prove it. However what had started as a light walking pace had slowly ramped up in intensity. Despite the treadmill only creeping along at a walking pace the exertion of walking in the tight bondage was fatiguing her quicker than normal. Soon her feet were cramping, and she could feel the very first hotspots forming on her toes. Her skin had taken on shine, as sweat quickly covered her body. She had other aches as well like where the tight rope rubbed against her chest. Her soft skin turning red as the rough fibres chafed against her flesh. Breathing was also becoming more difficult with each teetering step she took. Each sucking breath seemed never enough as the rope that wrapped around her chest seemed to becoming tighter with each passing minute. Despite all of this Ally could feel the silky strands of her tail beginning to stick to the juices that now ran freely down her inner thighs. She could only hope that those watching would not notice her obvious arousal. 
After the timer hit 30 minutes Ally was seriously beginning to worry. Without seeing the workout details Brian had entered she didn't know how long exactly he had set the time for. Secretly she was hoping he had set it for shorter than the 3 hours he had stated. But now as her muscles began to tire and cramp she wasn't so sure. It was now that she resolved that no matter what happened she would not go down without a fight. Ally would not give Brian and certainly not the strangers watching the satisfaction of seeing her break. If this is how it was going to be then she would show them that they could strip away everything that she had but they would not get the satisfaction of seeing her give up. 
She had fallen into a steady rhythm as the pace seemed to settle out after the 30 minute mark. The speed had stopped at not much more than a brisk walking pace, and although it was awkward in the high heels she was wearing, Ally was able to bear it. So it was she was concentrating so hard on where to place her next step that she did not notice the timer hit one hour and the beeping that signalled the next stage of the workout program. It was the now familiar pull of the leash that broke her concentration and told her something had changed. With desperate eyes she looked at the display, a climbing speed increase flashed on the screen. She struggled to adjust to the new much more demanding pace the treadmill now desired from her. No longer was she given a couple of seconds to see where to step, now it was taking everything she had just to move fast enough to keep the leash from pulling tight. 
The treadmill eventually stopped its speed increase and once more Ally found herself adjusting to the routine. She had spent many an hour on the treadmill before but never like this. Even though she was still only moving at no more than a hurried walking pace she felt physically and mentally exhausted. Each step was tedious further emphasized by the swinging of her tail that sent vibrations all the way down to the plug buried within her bottom. Soon muscles in her legs were burning unused to being forced into such an extreme posture. Ally tried to ignore the discomfort but it was hard. 
The worst part though was the feelings that were growing because of the hard member buried deep within. The more she tried to suppress these feelings the stronger they seemed to become. As much as she hated to admit it there was something oddly arousing about the thought of hundreds of complete strangers watching her. She could only imagine the show they were getting. Her body covered in sweat, breasts thrust out before her. Her thighs running with her own obvious arousal by a hidden pleasure buried within her. To cap it all off her tail swinging back and forth with each prancing step.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
When the timer hit 1.5 hours the beeping from the console startled her so much it almost sent her tumbling. Her arms pulled against their bindings, naturally attempting to brace herself, but this only seemed to make things worse, as they pulled the rope tighter across her chest compressing her ribs and tightening the grip about her breasts. At the same time the stumble had caused her to misstep. The leash pulled taunt as the collar began to once more grip around her neck. It was fear more than anything that saved her from a fall. Her own body producing the adrenaline she needed to surge forward. As her collar loosened she fought to get her breathing back under control. She was panting, trying to suck in as much precious oxygen as possible. When she felt the belt begin to turn faster beneath her she quickly turned to the screen. The climbing glowing numbers confirmed her fears. She tried to stay strong, to not let them see, but she was too exhausted both physically and mentally. The emotions inside of her bubbled over. Tears once more freely began to streak down her face. Her breathing was hampered as her body was wracked by great sobbing gulps. Ally had been determined not to give them the satisfaction of seeing her break, it was the only thing she had left but now she didn&#8217;t even have that. 
He had left her. 
Ally knew that she would never be able to keep this new pace the treadmill had changed to, a thought that only caused more tears to fall. No longer able to walk she was forced to shuffle along at more of a stumbling jog. Each time her foot came down she feared the force of the impact would cause her to fall. As she was trying to stop her tears, a new feeling hit her completely by surprise. She had not forgotten about the dildo that Brian had forced between her legs, how could she when for the better part of 2 hours it had been teasing her womanhood until her juices dripped heavily down her thighs. But then it started to move. Blinking back the last of her tears her eyes now dry, Ally tried to concentrate. At first Ally thought she was imagining it, but as its speed increased there was no mistaking it. Emotionally she was a mess her mind confused by all that was happening. She shouldn't be feeling these sexual stirrings, while tears were still drying upon her cheeks. But she was in no state to fight it. By the time Ally could hear the buzzing of the vibrator over the sounds of her own panting she was wracked with familiar emotions that threatened to overwhelm her body.&nbsp; 
Ally moaned deeply into the bit gag, flecks of drool and spit were sent flying across the room. No longer did she care about who might hear her. The intense pleasure forcing her eyelids to clench tightly closed. This would prove to be her last mistake. Without her eyes to focus on her next step she was hopelessly unbalanced. Her foot landed at an awkward angle, the loud sound of something snapping beneath her filled Ally with dread. Her eyes flew open in shock as she felt herself begin to fall. A wild fear filled her as she felt the tug of the taunt leash. Desperately she kicked out with her feet scrambling against the turning belt trying to find purchase. At the very last second she managed to get both feet beneath her again. Ally gave a huge sigh of relief as she stood balanced for the moment upon her exhausted legs. Her celebrations however were cut short. That loud snap she had heard had in fact been her right heels support piece snapping off its base. There was no time to stop her fall. With a sickening thump Ally crashed onto the belt. 
She had landed on her side her shoulder thankfully absorbing most of the impact. The landing knocked the wind out the poor girl, and would certainly be leaving bruises. Ally's cries of pain were cut short as the turning belt of the treadmill moved her prone form down its length. She gasped as her collar which had already barely allowed her to draw breath was slowly tightened. Fear and pain seemed to overwhelm her senses. Only her primal instincts of survival kept her fighting. Her struggles were in vain though as her collar now gripped her neck in a tight embrace, allowing only the faintest breath of air past. The treadmill was drawing her closer toward a fate that Ally knew would only end in tragedy for her.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Between the buzzing vibrator buried beneath her legs and the collar wrapped about her neck, the pleasure and pain were too much for Ally. The emotions that were filling her seemed to heighten the effects of the other, the pain and pleasure mixing together until they could not be told apart. Her orgasm was like no other she had ever experienced in her life. Her eyes rolled back, her mouth opened in a silent scream as the waves of bliss and ecstasy washed over her. The leash went as taunt as a violinists bow string as her whole body seemed to jerk and dance at its end. Ally's hips pumped the air, as if she was grinding herself against a phantom lover. Her bound hands curled into tight fists, her nails digging painfully into tender palms. 
In that instant all of her senses seemed enhanced. Heightened beyond anything she had ever felt. Her nostrils were filled with the sweet smell of her sex, her tongue licking the rubber of the bit gag that filled her mouth, and beyond all others the shaking of the intruder that filled her sensitive sex.
Slowly after what seemed an eternity her throes of pleasure subsided. Her legs still quivered and shook but her body had finally come to rest upon her bound her arms trapped behind her back. Her mind was a mess of emotion. Her muscles were cramping, each tiny movement sending jolts of pain shooting through her body. All she wanted to do was lie down and sleep. But she was not to be so lucky. The tight leash still kept her collar held fast. Each breath of hers now was short and ragged, her throat felt sore and dry. She scrambled to prop her body up as much as could onto her bound elbows. Achieving a small level of relief as the leash slackened slightly. Ally took what amounted to half her normal breath, but at that moment, it felt like the purest oxygen she had ever had. The fog that had clouded her mind seemed to be brushed away. With a semblance of rational thought returned to her, she finally realized that the treadmill had stopped. The belt had not dragged her kicking and screaming past the point of no return much to her relief. 
It was then that Ally realized she was no longer alone. Drool was dribbling down her chin as she looked up to find Brian standing above her.
"It looks like someone enjoyed themselves, a little too much" he said looking down at her. "You're lucky I just got home girl or else things might not have ended so well for you."
Ally could see the remote control for the treadmill in his hands. It hit her suddenly just how close she had come to drawing her last breath, if Brian had not been there to turn off the machine. Ally began to pathetically whine at him trying to plead with him to loosen the collar that was still clamped around her neck. 
"Shut up girl, or I will turn the belt on again!" he sneered. "Such a stupid bitch, you couldn't even keep your balance. I promised the viewers a show not you on your ass!" he growled at her. 
His words stung deep. Her emotions were in shatters, and she felt like at any second she was going to turn once more into a blubbering mess. Blinking back fresh tears Ally watched as he moved behind her to the treadmills console. She was filled with dread for a moment as she imagined him picking her up and forcing her to finish the work out, or worse start all over again from the beginning. 
But another part of her was hoping that he did. It wasn't something many would understand but the thought of Brian forcing her back up sent shivers through her body. To be made to walk until her muscles gave out, pushing her until she could bare it no longer. Then the collar would tighten once more and�. She shuddered, despite all she had been though, all that Brian had done to her, the humiliation and pain that he had caused her, despite it all thinking about it now caused her to feel that familiar pleasure building deep within her again.&nbsp; 
Brian did not start the work out again. Instead he loosened her leash until Ally was able to take her first full breath in ages. Her mind was tingling as each breath fuelled the oxygen high she now felt. She had little time to relax as the sound of the treadmills motor, sent cold shivers of fear racing down her back. It was not the belt that moved though it was the running platform itself. Gradually the surface on which her back was pressed against began to rise, lifting at an angle so that her head was soon higher than her bottom despite lying prone on her back. She began to slide along its length her bare skin rubbing roughly against the hard rubber running surface. The familiar tug of the leash began to tighten the collar once more around her neck. Ally's breathing quickly returned to a frightened panting. Her feet were now dangling over the back edge, and soon she feared her body would follow. 
Before Ally slipped off the edge of the surface Brian thankfully stopped the motor. Swiftly he knelt on the ground slipping in between her dangling legs. Having shed his clothing Ally could see that he had only one thing on his mind. Large masculine hands took a hold of her thighs, dragging her toward him. When she was no more than a few inches away Brian moved aside the straps that hid the dildo buried beneath her glistening lower lips. With a sucking sound he pulled the toy free of its warm home. Ally shuddered at the loss of the source of all her pleasure. After so long, now without the vibrator she felt oddly empty, almost like a part of her was missing. 
Grinning Brian held the still buzzing dildo up for the camera to see. "How's that for entertainment boys and girls" he wiped the dildo on her flat stomach before tossing it aside. 
With no further ceremony he entered her, his cock burying its way past her slick puffy red lips, sliding along her clenching walls until with one thrust he had sunk up to the hilt, the full length of his member inside of her. Ally let out a guttural groan as she felt the hot press of his cock. He did not pause long his own needs driving him. He began to buck his hips driving his member in and out of her soaked pussy. Each time his pelvis slapped against hers she would give a tiny gasp, or moan. Brian must have been hard since she had started her exercise, teasing himself by the sight of her naked body displayed in all its HD glory. The pounding of his coupling sending shockwaves through her body, he did not make love to her so much as he used her to satisfy his own primal desires. 
If Ally had not been so exhausted from her ordeal she may have felt more than just the tingle of passion deep within her before he had finished. Indeed it was not a long time for her to wait before he forced himself once more deep within her, his own body shaking as his cock pulsed sending his seed deep with her body where it began to mix with her own. Exhausted he seemed to collapse, his head lying on her chest. Ally let out an exhausted sigh, as finally she was able to close her eyes in peace. 
After a very hot shower Ally found herself in bed. Now given time to reflect she felt conflicted, the events and emotions of early leaving her exhausted. Not more than two words had been spoken between the two of them since Brian had released her soon after he had composed himself.
Her mind was still full of the emotions she had felt. All that pain and humiliation were still fresh. She could remember how she hated him for what he had done to her, how he had broken the trust between them. Had it all been part of the game? It had felt so�. real. Like usual though things seemed back to normal now that it was over.&nbsp; 
But something was still nagging at her something that she needed an answer to. She felt a pleasant tingle coursed through her body as the warmth of Brian's naked flesh press up against her back. They were both silent as his fingers slowly began to run through her silky flowing hair.
"You didn't actually broadcast that?" Ally asked looking up at him questionably. 
"Share you with others? No way! I am keeping you all to myself." Brian laughed.
Ally contemplated the thought for a moment. "But then how did you come back at just the right moment?" she asked.&nbsp; 
"I was watching from the doorway the entire time, remote in hand ready to press the emergency stop in an instant." He brushed her bangs back, tucking them behind her ear. "You didn't think I would actually leave, did you?" He kissed her bare neck.
"I thought�." She began to say.
With one finger Brian gently turned her face toward his. "Allison Bree Walker, I will never leave you." In that moment when he kissed her she knew that he was telling the truth. 
When their lips finally parted, Ally was all smiles. There were few that would understand the complexities of their relationship. But that did not matter, all that mattered was they had each other.
"Say Brian, you think we can watch the video?" Ally said deviously smiling up at him. 
Now it was Brian's turn to look surprised.&nbsp;&nbsp;
