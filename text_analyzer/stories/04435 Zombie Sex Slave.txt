Zombie Sex Slave: Part 1 -
Luck

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

She was broke. She had never
been in such a dire situation in her life. What were her options? Asking help
from her parents was out of the question - any �gift� from them came with heavy
chains of expectations attached. The rent was due and she probably could get by
with giving her landlord a partial payment �but right now she had nothing.
Quitting her job had not been a good idea; she probably should have kept
pushing her lawsuit and sue her employer as her friends advised her to, but she
just didn�t want to deal with it� ultimately she just wanted to forget about
the harassment and move on. Besides, it was her word against her boss, and he
probably would have gotten others to back him up. She was not out to take on
the world, she just wanted to get by� on her own.� But to accomplish that, she
needed to find another job, and fast.

&nbsp;

Kim picked the biggest office
tower around and went floor to floor filling out applications for a
receptionist. Making a game out of it helped�how many applications could she
fill out in an hour? She even timed each stop; she was averaging about fifteen
minutes per application. The game made it seem less tedious. When she got home,
she would compare how she did canvassing this building to the last, and so on.

&nbsp;

Then she struck gold. Halfway
through the 5th floor, she filled out an application for a business
that she knew nothing about. They interviewed her on the spot and asked when
she could start. Tomorrow! She was giddy as she left the office, thinking how things
were finally looking up! Now for the immediate crisis of raising fast money
before her first paycheck � she had to get her rent paid. She also needed to
get something in her stomach, and as she was leaving for the bus, she caught
site of a sandwich shop in another office building on the way. As she passed a
bulletin-board in the lobby a message caught her eye�

&nbsp;

YOUNG WOMEN 18 � 25 NEEDED IN
MENSTRUAL DRUG TEST. IMMEDIATE CASH, LIMITED OPENINGS. INQUIRE� IN SUITE 419.

&nbsp;

Immediate cash! That�s
exactly what she needed. This certainly was worth checking out; the sandwich
would have to wait. Perhaps they still had some openings? When she arrived at
the door, it simply announced:

&nbsp;

�Dr. Evelyn J. Richards,
MD�

&nbsp;

As Kim walked through the
door, it initially seemed like all the other offices she had visited today,
except for the slightest scent of medicine or antiseptic floating in the air.� Kim
couldn�t tell which it was�perhaps it was a mixture of both. It seemed strange
to Kim that a doctor�s office was stuck in the middle of a regular office
building, like it had been accidentally placed in the wrong building by
mistake. But this was becoming more common, as specialized services were
becoming more independent from the hospitals and medical buildings. Then Kim
saw the item that grandly pronounced that this office was different than all
the others: built into the back wall, was a huge fish tank, stocked with exotic
fish and colorful coral that no doubt cost a fortune. Although an aquarium was common
and almost mandatory in doctor�s offices, this tank was exceptionally stocked,
and it dwarfed most showroom tank displays at even the largest fish stores. Dr.
Richards was certainly making some cash.

&nbsp;

A receptionist smiled as Kim
walked in. The she seemed to be in her early twenties. Although she was
beautiful, with her wavy auburn hair, the hint of more mature facial features
was beginning to emerge. She was in the transitional period between �beautiful�
and �stunning��a chrysalis of sorts. A little more time would serve to sculpt
her face and further define her features, shedding any remnants of girlishness
and emerging as a complete woman. A very quiet orchestral melody was playing in
the background, and this seemed to enhance her beauty the slightest bit. �How
can I help you?� She warmly greeted Kim.

�

Kim almost started with her
standard �Are you accepting applications� routine, but caught herself. �Hi, I�m
here about the ad you placed downstairs about the testing.� 

&nbsp;

The receptionist seemed to be
sizing her up before replying. Perhaps they were looking for a particular body
type? She undressed Kim with her piercing green eyes, and after an
uncomfortable amount of time finally seemed to approve of what she saw.
�Wonderful! We have one slot left! I�m Debra. Let me tell you a bit about what
we�re doing. Your name is�?�

&nbsp;

�Kim, Kim Burns.�

&nbsp;

�Nice to meet you Kim. Have a
seat. We are testing a new menstrual drug. It is quite safe I assure you, but
the FDA requires quite an extensive amount of trials before approval.� Her
voice was sweet like syrup and it put Kim at ease, however she felt somewhat
inferior in the presence of the beautiful woman. Kim was certainly eye-catching
and had no problem attracting men. Her sandy blond hair had recently been cut
shorter, partially in response to the harassment from her last job - she had
been angry and wanted a change - but it served to define her cute facial
features. However, Kim would rarely be called �beautiful��no, she was forever
�cute�.

&nbsp;

�We would need to give you a
quick physical and get some information on your history, but barring any
allergies to certain medications, most women qualify.� Debra approached Kim
with the ubiquitous clipboard holding the questionnaire, and Kim was about to
ask the most important question before she was preempted by Debra�s answer�
�And we can give you a five hundred dollar check today�another five hundred
dollars on the completion of the testing period.�

&nbsp;

Five hundred dollars wasn�t
the full amount she needed, but it would sure help. This was turning out to be
a lucky day after all! Kim started to fill out the questionnaire, which got
quite invasive with its detailed questions about her sex habits, but since it
was other women who would be looking at this, it didn�t seem to matter.�
Besides, for one thousand dollars total, the private information was a small
amount to pay.

&nbsp;

Debra had left, apparently to
talk to the doctor. As she left the room, Kim did notice the tight skirt that
clung to Debra�s ass. This woman obviously wasn�t afraid to show off her
figure. And the way she sized Kim up made her feel that it was more sexual than
professional�Kim had been through that before. Was Debra a lesbian? Not that it
mattered much, but Kim wasn�t certain she would want to spend a lot of time
with her. She just didn�t find women sexually exciting, she was definitely into
men. The closest she had came to having sex with another woman was when she was
drunk with a girlfriend and they kissed each other in a demonstration of some
past boyfriends awful kissing techniques. This had led to a more passionate
kiss, but it ended quickly with one of them bursting out laughing.

&nbsp;

Debra rapped at Evelyn�s door
and let herself in quickly closing the door behind her. �I�ve got a girl who
might work!� she whispered to the doctor. Evelyn was in her mid thirties, an
attractive brunette with fantastic legs and ass. She prided herself on these
qualities as much as her academic and professional accomplishments� and she had
accomplished quite a bit in her time. She was a brilliant student at college
and medical school, and, once she began practicing, had quickly made a name for
herself as a researcher of some caliber. Several larger corporations had been
interested in taking her on, but Evelyn was steadfast on having her own private
practice and working as a consultant. Evelyn was very private, and working for
a large company would not allow her to indulge in her�interests. 

&nbsp;

Evelyn had met Debra at a lesbian
hangout. A young attractive woman oozing of innocence had entered the bar and
Evelyn immediately swooped down on her. However, another woman had apparently
spotted the same vulnerability and the two of them almost collided in an effort
to snatch the prey first. An initial evil glare between the two ultimately gave
way to laughter and they all introduced each other. The other Domme was Debra. It
was unusual for someone as attractive and young as Debra to be that aggressive,
and Evelyn eventually recognized that as an admirable quality. As if they were
reading each others minds, they went in for the kill together. The young girl
didn�t stand a chance as the two fed her drink after drink and made her feel at
ease, despite their aggressive nature. This was an art in itself - to dominate
the situation, yet make the prey feel comfortable and non-threatened. Both
Evelyn and Debra were excelling at as they tested each other, demonstrating their
skills.

&nbsp;

The girl confessed she had
never been with a woman and was simply curious. The two Dommes �admitted� that
they themselves were new to this too, and because Debra�s place was closer,
eventually they headed there after the bar closed. Once they arrived at Debra�s,
the mood quickly changed. The girl, drunk, had collapsed on the couch and was
no longer the main attraction, as she was already in the possession of the
other two women. Instead, the two Dommes were more curious about each other and
found themselves to be quite alike. Although Evelyn was very successful and more
than ten years older, she found that she had as much in common with Debra as
anyone she had ever met. Debra was currently looking for work and Evelyn
decided that on Monday the first thing she would do was fire her useless
secretary and hire Debra. 

&nbsp;

The women decided to
celebrate with a glass of Champagne and a night of mistreating their catch.�
They yanked the poor, sleeping girl off of the couch, and took relentless
advantage of her. Evelyn hadn�t been as forthcoming about her sadistic
tendencies while talking with Debra, but it soon became obvious Debra had quite
a sadistic streak too�perhaps even more profound than Evelyn�s! This was
exciting to both the women as they went further and further, seeing just how far
the other would go, as they abused the girl.� They teased her and tormented
her.� They caressed her body, face and hair, crooning at her beauty, only to
abruptly pull her by the hair or pinch her by the nipples to make her abide by
their wishes.� 

&nbsp;

It wasn�t long before their
victim was sobbing uncontrollably. �They ended up taking turns holding the girl
to the bed, one sitting on the hapless girl�s waist and holding her arms to her
side while the other mercilessly grinded her pussy onto the girl�s face,
threatening to smother her if she didn�t lick her pussy with enough gusto.� By
the time they let her go, the poor girl couldn�t even speak clearly from the
overuse of her tongue. She was so traumatized by the ordeal in the end that it
was highly doubtful that she would ever try being with a woman again.

&nbsp;

Evelyn and Debra had been
together ever since, sharing their conquests and exploits. Their relationship
was strangely platonic, except when carting home a victim. When this happened
their passions erupted, and after they were finished with their latest prey
they ended up in each other�s arms in the most intense, passionate lovemaking
either had experienced before they had met. This dynamic seemed to keep any
jealousy at bay, and allowed them to become best friends. The fact that Evelyn
was Debra�s boss didn�t seem to have an adverse effect as Debra was very
thorough and efficient at anything she did. Evelyn�s finances had given her a
freedom to pursue directions that suited her interests, and because Debra was
on the same wavelength, she had a willing accomplice. This led them to today, a
culmination of long research and patient planning that hopefully would result
in the most amazing prize either woman could imagine.

&nbsp;

Evelyn looked at Debra and
smiled. �You like her, huh?� This was exciting. �Perhaps I should meet our
little test subject, and let you know if I approve?� Evelyn walked out to the
lobby and sized up the woman. She was very pretty, blond and tall. She had
decent sized breasts and they were obviously not enhanced. This was important
as Evelyn did not want to have to deal with removing implants. There were a few
other potential problems that needed to be checked out before the decision was
made.

&nbsp;

There really was a
legitimate menstrual drug test going on, and the two had tested many participants.
But there also was another, far more personal and private study that Evelyn had
been waiting to embark on. Every potential candidate so far had failed to meet
the important qualifications:

&nbsp;

No one must know the woman
was here.

&nbsp;

She must not have
contacted anyone on her cell phone while in the building.

&nbsp;

Preferably she would have
had no other business to attend to in the building.

&nbsp;

An added bonus would be if
the candidate arrived on foot or on bus. A car could present problems as there
were security cameras in the lot. This question was easily answered by the fact
that one of the stipulations for the legitimate study was that the subject not
drive after taking the drug the first time. Kim had told the women that no, she
took the bus over.

&nbsp;

Kim also consented to a
physical. No red flags of warning went off in her head as this whole situation appeared
to be a grand stroke of luck. There was nothing to fear since she was dealing
with women, and Dr. Richards� professional air put her immediately at ease. The
doctor was also very attractive, and could have easily been a model had she let
her hair down and put on different makeup. 

&nbsp;

Evelyn spoke in a calm
soothing manner. Her voice was deeper than Debra�s, and it had a hint of a
smoky quality� she spoke quietly. This had the effect of causing people to
listen closer and creating the air of importance. Men and women had fallen for
her voice before; it was something you didn�t notice in most people, but you
noticed Evelyn�s voice. One word could sum it up: sensual.

&nbsp;

As Kim was led back to the
exam room, she indulged in chit chat, telling the two that she just happened to
pass by this building, spotting the deli. This seemed to generate unusual
interest in the two women, and Kim was a bit confused as Dr. Richards probed
her more about this. Kim�s mind was set at ease though when the doctor
explained that she had invested in the deli, and wanted to know more about the
circumstances that led people to eat there.� As Debra left the exam room and
closed the door, Dr. Richards continued the light conversation as she
instructed Kim to get undressed.

&nbsp;

The cell phone was the
easiest to verify. Debra simply went through Kim�s jacket while Kim was in the
exam room getting undressed and looked at the calls made and calls received.
Nothing in the last four hours. Debra�s heart began to pound harder as she
began to realize that Kim might end up qualifying to be their first real test
subject. There had been others that the two women had tested small amounts of the
�special� drugs on, but this was going to be a whole different level of
control. Debra pretended to need something from the exam room and caught
Evelyn�s eye�a quick nod. Debra couldn�t help sneaking a peek at Kim, naked,
being gently probed by Evelyn. Evelyn, on the other hand, made certain nothing
seemed inappropriate during the exam; it would be a mistake to jeopardize
things when they might be so close.

&nbsp;

Now it was the moment of
truth. Evelyn had to make the decision whether to give Kim the real test drug,
or administer Rohypnol. Rohypnol, like GHB, was considered a �date rape drug�,
and was illegal in the United States. It was a fast acting sedative and would
cause dizziness or drowsiness. A benefit to giving this to her would be that if
things didn�t go as planned, the drug affected the person�s memory, and the
whole incident (or at least large chunks) would be forgotten. Kim could be
released if something went wrong with little chance of any serious consequences.
Also, the adverse effects could be attributed to a reaction to the legitimate test
drug. Evelyn called Debra in to record the time, 3:42 PM, as she administered
the drug to their new test subject. Debra knew which drug it was, and her
excitement was almost impossible to contain.

&nbsp;

Both women pretended to be
preoccupied with other tasks, but in reality, they were watching every movement
Kim made. Finally Kim spoke up: �I�m feeling kinda dizzy�.

&nbsp;

Zombie Sex Slave: Part 2 -
Severing Connections

&nbsp;

It was time to prepare for
the most delicate and dangerous part of the plan. Evelyn would pull her Subaru
around to the back of the building, while Debra got the drugged up girl ready
to go. Kim was nodding in and out of consciousness, and while this was fine for
the time being, it would be much better if she could walk on her own. Debra
reassured Kim that she was just having a reaction to the drug and everything
would be fine � it was just a harmless and fairly common side effect to the
drug, and that�s why they needed to do these tests. Evelyn and Debra were taking
every precaution just in case the plan had to be abandoned and Kim somehow
regained her memory (though that was an unlikely set of circumstances as Evelyn
was quite methodical and had the proper dose calculated).

&nbsp;

Debra was certain this girl
was completely straight. That fact would make this endeavor even more exciting.
The poor girl had probably never thought of being with another woman. Kim would
soon learn that men were something of the past. Debra had been with very few
men and most had been early on in high school. She thoroughly despised them now,
and her last encounter with a man was unquestionably the final one. He had raped
her, but they parted on her terms�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

He
had come in through the dining room window. Sometimes it paid to take your time
and check every window around the house, since much of the time at least one
was unlocked. It always pissed him off to have to break a window, and then,
after entering the house, find that a window or door was already unlocked. He
was more careful now, about everything. Prison wasn�t that bad, it was registering
as a sex offender, taking those fucking classes, and then living in a goddamn
sex offender house for an undetermined amount of time that sucked. Those
fucking case workers, always wanting to know how you felt, what you were
thinking�if they only knew! Assholes!

&nbsp;

The
whole experience left him pissed, and he was ready to seek his revenge again.
These bitches thought they were in control - that they ran things in this
world, and it was his job to show them, one by one, that they weren�t. Fuck,
they even had female prison guards�he couldn�t fucking believe it! Well, he
would show at least one woman just who was in charge in a minute. He had been noticed
this little firecracker while he was scoring some shit from the park. Her house
was right across the street from where the deal was going down, and he had to
keep an eye out for cops. He watched everyone suspiciously, he was very
attentive. 

&nbsp;

She
drove up to her house, and quickly glanced over at him and his boys. Fucking prissy-assed
white bitch thought she was better than him, he could tell. The wheels started
turning almost immediately. The drugs were secondary now; there was another,
more important addiction to feed.

&nbsp;

Now
he was standing in her fancy dining room. He would have loved to just sit down
and crank up the TV, and have the bitch come out and find him, but it would be even
better to wake her up as he stood over her bed, watching the panic well up in
her eyes as she realized what was going to happen. Really the only thing he had
to watch for was a dog. He hated fucking dogs. That�s how he got caught the
last time�he managed to kill the fucker, but she had already called the cops
and he was hurt. He should have killed the bitch too.

&nbsp;

No,
this cunt had no dog; he just walked up to her bed and watched. He was hard as
a rock. Thanks to the Viagra he took, he no longer had the problem he used to
while doing this. Wasn�t science fucking wonderful? No longer would he
have to use other objects (although that was fun too), he could instead just
keep fucking her in every way imaginable until HE was too sore to continue. He
still couldn�t cum, but that could wait till later.

&nbsp;

She
started stirring. It was weird; some of the bitches seemed to know something
was wrong even when they were asleep. He kinda thought that was cool. They
should do a study on that or something: he could be put in a room while some
were asleep and rape the ones that awoke. Maybe they could pay him good money
to help out with that research. Damn. He had great ideas sometimes.

&nbsp;

Going
over his thoughts, he realized that the bitch was looking at him. She gasped a
bit from the shock but quickly recovered�she wasn�t a screamer. She didn�t ask
him what he was doing. That always pissed him off - dumb cunts, what the fuck
did they think he was doing there? Admiring their beds? He ripped off her
covers and held his knife out for her to see. She was dressed in a T-shirt and
panties. Before he could tell her to strip, she began removing her panties.
�Hello.� She said.

&nbsp;

Alarm
bells started going off in his head. �Shut the fuck up!� He growled as he slapped
her hard in the face. She was acting all wrong. The alarm bells had gone off
several times before, the last time was in the house with the dog. He probably
should get out now�but damn, she was fine. He had to hit that. Fuck the bells, they
had been wrong before. They were ringing with his heartbeat; they pulsed in his
brain�

&nbsp;

clang�clang�

&nbsp;

He
grabbed her, putting his knife at her throat, and pulled down his pants. Her
legs were� already spread?� What the
fuck? Was this whore into this? It didn�t really matter, but she even seemed
to help guide his cock in. She wasn�t wet, so he had to ram himself in�this
hurt her, he could tell. It usually did, since he was well endowed, but this
bitch�s cries were confusing. Were they cries of pain, or something else? He pounded
harder, egged on by her noises. He was ripping her, yet she wasn�t resisting!� Fuck, she was even pulling him to her�

&nbsp;

Clang�Clang�

&nbsp;

Soon
she was doing the work. She was in control. The crazy fucking bitch was helping
him rape her, but with ice in her eyes�how fucking weird was this whore?
Although he didn�t like the feeling of her being in control, he couldn�t help
himself; she was really fucking him hard. He would have to come back for
more of this pussy after tonight! This kept on going for a long time and he was
starting to get tired, he wanted to lie down. She could sense this but she
wasn�t done yet. She started to flip him over�

&nbsp;

CLANG!�CLANG!�

&nbsp;

She
was on top of him screwing. The fucking bitch was the horniest he�d ever met.
Where was his knife? Oh yeah, it was by his right hand. If he needed it he
could always grab it. She seemed to be out of breath for the moment. Then she
stopped. She was smiling at him.

&nbsp;

CLANG!!� CLANG!!

&nbsp;

The
movement was so swift he almost didn�t see it. He thought he saw the shimmer of
his knife fly by but he would never be certain. He tried to lift up his head to
check, but the tendons had been severed along with his trachea and carotid
arteries. Instead, his head bent back and opened up the wound mimicking an
obscene second mouth, a bright-red laughing smile. In trying to raise his head,
the severed tendons caused the lip of the wound to curl and the arteries
pointed towards the ceiling. As he lay staring at the ceiling, he was amazed at
how high the blood spurted up�it seemed to almost hit the ceiling at first, but
now it was much, much less. At least that damn clanging stopped. He was annoyed
at the blood pooling in his eyes from the red rain, but he didn�t have the energy
to do anything about it�it didn�t matter that much anyways as it was getting dimmer�

&nbsp;

�I�m
going to call the police and take a shower.� He heard the bitch say before the
last bit of blood drained from his brain. �I hope it was worth it. It was for
me.� 

&nbsp;

The
police found her cowering in the shower, crying hysterically. She had to at least
keep up the appearance of someone devastated by the attack.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

This incident had literally
severed any possibility of Debra ever being with a man again. The memory of it
elicited different emotions at different times; sometimes she felt violated and
sickened when she thought of that night, but at other times she felt that rush
of power she had felt when she looked into his surprised eyes and watched as he
finally understood...Debra took the control from him and almost sliced his head
off with it. Ever since that event, it was her goal to forever remain in
control of any situation.� What she did
not fully realize was that, in this new obsession with control, she had become
a predator herself � much more refined. but ultimately no less single
minded.� She relished her ability now to
assert dominance and control over unsuspecting victims�even if she had to share
some of that with Evelyn. But it was as erotic to watch Evelyn play her �games�
with the sorry girls as it was for Debra to play with them herself. That�s why
their relationship worked�they fed off of each other.

&nbsp;

Debra stroked Kim�s hair as
she waited for Evelyn�s call. It was hard to stop from taking the girl right
here, but she had to wait. She continued to assure Kim everything was fine. Finally
Evelyn called - she was waiting. �However,
it was obvious that Kim wouldn�t make it on her own power. Plan B: Wheelchair.
While this could attract more attention, it was now a necessity.� Debra Loaded Kim into the chair and locked
the door.� It was Showtime.

&nbsp;

Debra�s heart was pounding so
loud she could hear it in the elevator. Finally she made it all the way down to
Evelyn�s car without spotting a single person. Evelyn was clearly disappointed
when she saw the wheelchair, but sprung into action to help. Quickly Kim was
ushered into the car and Evelyn pulled out. �How did it go?� asked Evelyn. 

&nbsp;

�I think we have ourselves a
subject.� Debra smiled back. �Are we really doing this?� She asked. It seemed
like a wonderful dream. The anticipation reminded her of Christmas as a little
girl. �How are you doing, Honey?� Evelyn asked, laughing as she looked at the semi-conscious
form of Kim in her rear view mirror. The fun they could have while
accomplishing some major research was a win/win situation, and if the research
didn�t pan out, they would still have a slave to keep as their own. Kim was not
some temporary sub who mistakenly thought she was willing to suffer under Debra
and Evelyn, only to find out she got more than she bargained for. No, Kim was
the real deal. No games�at least no games from Kim.

&nbsp;

As the car continued down the
highway heading closer and closer to Kim�s final destination, the other two
women were silent, lost in thought but occasionally glancing at each other with
gleaming eyes. Neither woman could keep the smile off her face as each mulled
over dreams and ideas that could finally be realized. 

&nbsp;

Dark clouds rolled in from
the west in a dramatic punctuation to the events that were occurring, as
Evelyn�s Outback and its three occupants pulled into her massive estate. As the
two women loaded Kim into the wheelchair a light rain began to fall. Kim was
not fully aware of the rain hitting her cheeks, and she quietly slipped into
unconsciousness. The raindrops ran down and fell off her face like artificial
tears as Debra wheeled the newest occupant into Evelyn�s house of horrors.

Zombie Sex Slave: Part 3 � Strange
New World

&nbsp;

Even with all the lights
ablaze, the room remained dark, heavy, as if the room actually had weight. It
seemed that even if one brought in a hundred lights, the darkness could still
hide in the corners, biding its time. It was the room of a thousand future sorrows.
Evelyn�s laboratory was a massive space that encompassed almost the whole
basement of her mansion. The room was a dreamland for any scientist - it was
filled with all the amenities a researcher could ask for. Evelyn was able to
afford the latest and greatest of everything. 

&nbsp;

Her newest acquisition, however,
is what really made the room unique�Kim, naked and secured to an exam table
with her legs strapped in gynecologist stirrups. She was slowly beginning to regain
consciousness, but was still too out of it to realize the predicament she was
in. Her soft moans had still not drawn the attention of Debra in the next room.


&nbsp;

The two rooms couldn�t have
been more different. Barn-like doors separated Evelyn�s laboratory from her
greenhouse, bright and teaming with dozens of plants for Evelyn�s research. Jimson
Weed, Belladonna or Devil�s Cherry, Brugmansias, and hallucinogens and opiates
such as Marijuana, Peyote, Poppies and Coca plants. �In short, any plant that had mind or nervous
system affecting characteristics could be found here. The smells of the living
plants from the greenhouse mingled with the medicine and chemical smells of the
other room, creating a strange evil perfume that hung in the air. 

&nbsp;

Debra was watering the plants
by hand (for the watering system had burst the other day), pondering the
details of this �experiment�. With Kim now down here they would be forced to
repair the system themselves. It was, so far, the only downside to the
abduction, which had gone better than they could have hoped. Debra couldn�t
wait for Kim to awake. �It had been a
while since they had brought a girl home, and she really had some pent-up
energy. Just thinking of the fun they could have with her caused Debra to instinctively
rub herself against the table. She wanted to finish watering quickly so she
could go back to the laboratory and continue playing with the unconscious girl.
Then she heard the moans.

&nbsp;

Kim was starting to become aware
that something was seriously wrong, her hands were bound and her legs�were
strapped into stirrups. She was naked and her pussy was sore, had she been
raped? If she had, maybe it was better that she had been unconscious at the
time, but by the looks of things, she was in for a longer ordeal. She tried
desperately to recall any memory that could give a clue to how she ended up
here, but she could only remember filling out applications�then getting a job.
Her mind was so confused and foggy.

&nbsp;

A silhouette of a woman
appeared in the bright doorway. Kim couldn�t make out whom was, but she started
to recall her last memories before the blackout. Debra and Dr. Richards. �The woman walked closer. This was Debra, and
she was smiling. �Good morning dear!� Debra crooned as she began to caress
Kim�s forehead. �You�ve been asleep for a long time, and I could hardly wait for
you to wake up�� Debra pinched Kim�s nipple hard and caused her to yelp in
pain. �What the fuck are you doing?� Kim angrily spat. �You better let me go NOW!�

&nbsp;

Debra laughed and pinched
harder, forcing another louder protest. �Let you go? I will do no such thing.�
Debra�s hands moved softly away from the sensitive nipple and down the length
of Kim�s bound form. Kim took in a sharp breath as if Debra�s hands were cold,
which they weren�t�Kim was just panicked by the violation of this woman�s hands
on her body. �Besides, Evelyn would be so mad if I let you go.� Debra�s hands
slipped down to Kim�s forcibly exposed pussy, causing Kim to reflexively try to
move away, but her bonds wouldn�t allow that dignity. �Evelyn has some real
ground-breaking experiments planned and I think the least you could do is try
to help out. �After all, you did sign up
to be a test subject.�

&nbsp;

Debra�s probing fingers
located Kim�s clitoris, and she played gently with it between her thumb and
forefinger before giving it as hard a pinch as she did Kim�s nipple. Kim
screamed in pain and bucked as Debra pinched harder. �Sensitive isn�t it? It�s
amazing how much a simple pinch can hurt!� Debra continued to pinch, increasing
the pressure until she was pinching Kim�s clit as hard as she could.� Kim�s protestations melted into one long
scream, her eyes wide with astonishment, as Debra bent down and lowered her
mouth to Kim�s breast, biting hard on her sore nipple to bring Kim to a
crescendo of pain.� Kim�s scream raised
to another level as she felt pain she had never imagined. �STOP! Please!� Kim finally
managed, tears running down her cheeks, once she managed to catch her breath. 

&nbsp;

Debra had squeezed all blood
out of Kim�s clitoris, and had bitten into her nipple so hard she almost bit it
off. Once she released Kim�s clitoris from her vice-like grip, the blood
started to flow back in, causing a fresh new series of painful sensations.
Raising her head up to see if her nipple was still there, Kim spotted a trickle
of blood running down her breast. Like spectators at a racetrack, both women
watched the tiny stream of blood as it ran into the valley between her breasts
and diverted itself up in the direction of Kim�s neck.� Debra prevented the finish however, as she
swooped down with her tongue and lapped up the drop, giggling. This woman was
obviously getting a kick from her torments and Kim decided she better try
reasoning with her. �Please, I swear I won�t tell anyone! I have no money�I�m
really not worth anything to you.�

&nbsp;

�Not worth anything???� Debra
laughed as she walked around and stood before Kim�s spread legs. She then
reached over and grabbed a tube of KY jelly and squirted a large amount on her
hand. �Don�t sell yourself short!� Why,
you�re worth a lot to me, hon. I know Evelyn thinks you are more than valuable�
she considers you precious!� Debra was now coating Kim�s vagina with a liberal
amount of jelly. �Please Debra�� Kim�s pleading trailed off as Debra began to
insert first two, then three, fingers into Kim, causing her to gasp loudly.
�Have you ever been fisted Kim?� Debra asked as she forcibly stretched Kim
wider and wider, adding the forth finger, then pushing hard with her hand
causing a new wave of screams from Kim. �Kim, of course, had not been fisted, and had
not even been overly sexually active, so this brutal intrusion by this sadistic
bitch was another type of pain that Kim had never even thought to be ready
for.� How much pain could a person cause?

&nbsp;

Debra�s other hand moved away
from Kim�s pelvis and started touching Debra�s own wet pussy. She wouldn�t need
any lubricant there, as Debra was providing so much juice that it began to run
down her thigh. As Debra stretched Kim and pushed more of her hand in against
the resistance, Kim started to descend into her pain, and her screams turned to
moans of agony. �Oh my, you are a tight little girl!� Debra mocked as her
finger played more gently with her own bud. Kim�s sobbing moans intensified and
added to Debra�s intensity as she worked harder with both hands; gentle but
rhythmically with one�firm and forceful with the other. As Debra worked herself
into a furor someone entered the room startling both women. It was Evelyn.

&nbsp;

�Ah! Caught you with your
hand in the cookie jar!� Evelyn sternly mocked. Debra laughed and began to
resume her activities �Sorry Mommy!� If Kim was looking for any help from
Evelyn, those hopes were dashed as Evelyn began to strip. �Please�� Kim softly
pleaded as she looked at Evelyn for any kind of mercy. Evelyn very precisely
folded her clothes when she undressed as they were very expensive; they were
nothing to leave lying around on the floor of her lab. 

&nbsp;

Evelyn�s body, while not as
full as Kim or Debra�s, was nonetheless fantastic; thinner and more statuesque,
it could easily be classified as the archetypical model�s shape. Small but pert
breasts, and a full yet slim ass, moving down to very long legs, provided
Evelyn a graceful dignity that only complimented her mind. She was a force to
be reckoned with.

&nbsp;

Evelyn walked over and stood
by Kim�s head. Kim turned away as Evelyn stood with her pussy right by her, the
smell of Evelyn�s arousal unmistakable. �Hi Kim. Maybe it�s time you got to
know me better.� Evelyn lowered the head of the exam table until she was able
to comfortably straddle Kim�s face. Kim tried desperately to shake her head
loose from Evelyn�s grip, but it was impossible. Her muffled cries disappeared
deep into Evelyn�s pussy as Evelyn turned to Debra, �The lady doth protest too
much, methinks!� The pain in Kim�s pussy was now accompanied by the humiliation
of having Evelyn�s wet cunt smashed in her face, and Kim thought for a moment
she might pass out as she fought to breathe. 

&nbsp;

Debra�s sensations were
heightened as she watched Evelyn�s ass as Evelyn ground her pelvis into the
sobbing girl�s face. Evelyn turned her head around and smiled knowingly at
Debra as the two women continued their assault, both working themselves into
higher and higher states of arousal. Finally Debra reached the point where she
could no longer hold off and pushed as hard as she could with her hand deep
inside Kim. This caused frantic, muffled cries from beneath Evelyn�s pussy, and
in turn caused Evelyn to bear down as hard as she could. Kim was on the verge
of passing out from both pain and lack of oxygen, as she heard the moans of
passion outside of her own cries of agony. The sick, twisted women began to cum
at the same time as the darkness began to engulf Kim, but the orgasm mercifully
caused Evelyn to involuntarily bob up and down on Kim�s face, allowing the
needed air to rush back in to her burning lungs.

&nbsp;

Finally Kim was free of the
double violation as Debra and Evelyn collapsed into each others arms in a
passionate kiss. They weren�t done yet, but Kim�s role had been temporarily fulfilled,
and she could only wait until the two were ready to do whatever they had
planned next for her. The sounds of the sobs from Kim whipped the two women
into a passionate frenzy, as they licked and sucked their way to several
orgasms. Through her tears Kim took an ominous inventory of the items in the
room�strange medical instruments, beakers filled with chemicals, whips and
shackles. It was a bizarre mixture of a laboratory and a dungeon, and from the
moans of passion coming from the floor next to her�it was a strange new world
indeed.�

Zombie Sex Slave: Part 4 � The
Alice in Wonderland Effect

&nbsp;

She cried softly to herself.
Kim had been raped, but did it make it worse that she was raped by women? She
didn�t know, other than that she was violated and in pain. She still had
Evelyn�s wetness all over her face and could still smell her. Kim�s pussy was
ripped and sore, perhaps this is what it felt like after having a baby? The two
women had eventually taken their activities upstairs and left Kim to wallow in
her thoughts.

&nbsp;

She was mad at herself for
getting into this predicament, but when Kim stepped though her �misdeeds�, she
couldn�t pinpoint any glaring mistakes or her ignoring of flashing warning
signs. She had simply done what had seemed logical and happened to be at the
wrong place at the wrong time. However, this realization offered no real comfort.
She still was bound to a table, raped, and by the sounds of it - in for some
kind of experiment at the hands of some twisted lesbians.

&nbsp;

The fear of what was to come
was heavy. Kim was afraid of doctors, and she had apparently had good reason.
She was at the mercy of a sadist, a guinea pig or lab rat to be used in an�

&nbsp;

experiment.

&nbsp;

The word itself was ominous.
Unknown, unstable, untested�undead. Why did she come up with that? It
was something she thought she heard Evelyn say while Kim�s head was pressed
between Evelyn�s thighs ��my little zombie�. Why was that important? Her mind
was racing, maybe she was just freaking out.

&nbsp;

It was terrible to be bound,
Kim discovered. Time crawled. Annoying itches popped up that couldn�t be
scratched, pains that needed rubbing and most of all, wiping off Evelyn�s
fucking cum from her face!� But all Kim
could do was lay and wait, yelling obscenities that only succeeded in
disturbing the otherwise silent walls.

&nbsp;

The two women giggled as they
listened to the variations of obscenities Kim came up with. The yelling was
barely audible, however, as they were upstairs gathering video cameras and
tripods to document the experiments. �Grab my digital camera Debra. I want to
take some close up photos of the dilation of her pupils. We should also bring
down the cattle prod just in case.� �Debra
smiled, she had only used the prod once on a girl and delighted at the howls
she received in response. But Evelyn had always insisted that it not be used on
unwilling girls, but now the rules were a little different.

&nbsp;

As the two women entered the
lab, Kim�s angry yelling ceased and became quiet pleadings. �That�s better.�
Debra said in response to the more gentle tones emanating from the girl. Yet
the calmer pleadings were just as ignored as the previous yelling was. Debra
began to set up tripods in various places around the room, as Evelyn busied
herself at the medical table. Kim observed that Evelyn had a lab coat on, but
flashes of the coat opening showed she was naked underneath. For some reason
this was especially disturbing to Kim. Evelyn reached for a bottle of powder
with a label marked �Hyoscine hydrobromide (Scopolamine)�.

&nbsp;

Evelyn had become interested
in the so-called zombie drugs after she had watched a silly movie as a teenager
by Wes Craven titled �The Serpent and the Rainbow�. This film was loosely based
on the book, a flawed study of the zombie rituals and medicines of Haiti,
authored by Wade Davis. While much of the work was suspect, one primary truth
that rose to the public consciousness was the effects of the drug Scopolamine. 

&nbsp;

The Mother of all Date
Rape Drugs, Scopolamine was a fundamental part of the zombie legend. It
rendered the victim absolutely receptive and vulnerable to complete control.
From the instant the drug was given, anterograde amnesia occurred. Unlike other
date rape drugs, the memories could not be retrieved, even under hypnosis.

&nbsp;

A version of the drug called
Burundanga was currently being used by criminals in Columbia, given to victims
that are then instructed to do the bidding of the provider. One ingenious
example was of three young Bogota women who smeared the drug on their breasts,
and lured men to lick them. The women then held the men hostage for days as
they drained their bank accounts.

&nbsp;

Evelyn had studied
Scopolamine, but wanted to find a longer lasting substitute as her tests with
the drug showed that the effects only lasted twenty-four to forty-eight hours.
Plus, the subjects she had experimented on were necessarily willing�she wanted
to see the effects on someone who would never consent to her wishes. Several
different variations would be tested on Kim, starting with a straight dose of
seven milligrams of pure pharmaceutical Scopolamine.

&nbsp;

The hallucinations that
accompanied such a large dose of the drug also had the effect of making the
victim believe whatever they were told. Unlike hallucinations on other drugs
like LSD or pot, these visions are absolutely believable to the prey�the victim
knows these visions are real. Debra and Kim had played a bit with this
on some of the other subjects, but with Kim they were determined to push it as
far as they could.

&nbsp;

�While Evelyn wouldn�t smear the drug on her
breasts, a wickedly symbolic way of administering it had been agreed upon by
her and Debra. Short of injection, dissolving the powder in liquid was the
surest and fastest way of getting the body to absorb the complete dose. And, of
course, being the sadists the two women were, no normally acceptable liquid
would do. 

&nbsp;

The two women took turns
squatting over a bucket and empting their bladders. While Kim couldn�t see what
the women were up to, she could make out from the sounds that they were
urinating. First Debra as Kim heard her say �I don�t have much, I just went.� A
small but loud stream hit the inside of the bucket and was amplified by the
empty metal shape. As Evelyn took her turn it sounded as if a water faucet had
been turned on and would never quit. �That�s not fair!� Debra protested. �You
have about five times more in there than I do!�

&nbsp;

�You need to have more
control.� Evelyn shot back. The urine mix was then poured into a glass where a
cup full of the warm yellow liquid was measured out. �Don�t dump the rest out
Evelyn� Debra spoke as she handed the bottle of powder to her companion. �Let�s
make her drink it once she�s under. We�ll tell her it�s Champagne!�

&nbsp;

Kim, feeling dread wash over
her like a wave, was hoping against hope that she heard this wrong, but she
knew in her heart she didn�t. The thought alone made her gag. What kind of
nightmare was she in? Could this all be some sick joke? The pain in her pussy
told her otherwise. What did Debra mean by �once she�s under�? Were they
going to put her under to operate on her? While she desperately wanted the
answers to these questions, Kim was afraid to ask. Maybe the ignorance, while
not being bliss, was better than the knowledge.

&nbsp;

Evelyn did not want Kim to hear
a suggestion in any way as to what was going to happen. This could skew the
results, and while making the victim believe they were going to become a zombie
was part of the process in Haiti, Evelyn wanted the results of the pure drug
with no pre-suggestion. She may have blurted something out while she was
cumming on Kim�s face, but she was certain Kim couldn�t possibly know.

&nbsp;

�I�m ready when you are
Debra.� Evelyn spoke as she walked up to Kim stirring the terrible mixture.
Debra soon joined her companion standing over Kim. She had a large funnel in
her hand, and attempted to force it into Kim�s mouth� but Kim held her teeth
clenched tightly shut. A simple hard pinch to Kim�s nose loosened her jaw and
allowed Debra enough room to cram the funnel in. Duct tape was then wrapped
around the funnel and Kim�s mouth ensuring a tight seal with nowhere for liquid
to escape. Kim struggled strenuously, but to no avail. �Let�s record the time
Debra.� Evelyn spoke as she steadied Kim�s shaking head. Debra quickly jotted
down the time then resumed her tight grip on Kim.

&nbsp;

Kim was screaming as much as
she could through the funnel now, which ended up sounding comical to the two
evil women. �Now Kim, you better settle down and get a grip. If you start
choking or gagging you might end up clogging your airway. If you don�t drink
this we�ll put something much worse in your mouth, it�s up to you.� Evelyn
began to pour the drug laced piss into the funnel. �Down the hatch!� Debra
giggled.

&nbsp;

The pungent salty liquid
began to fill in the back of Kim�s throat, and Debra pinched Kim�s nose so that
the only way to breathe was to open her throat and let it down. Kim held off as
long as she could but was finally betrayed by her aching lungs. With her nose
pinched, Kim wasn�t really able to taste the urine as fully as she normally
would, and she was fighting more with the concept than the reality of the
taste. Evelyn kept pouring a steady stream of the liquid in until the glass was
empty. She shook in the last drops more as a final insult than an effort to
ensure that all was consumed. �There! That wasn�t so bad was it?� Evelyn said
in a singsong voice as if she was talking to a child.

&nbsp;

Kim�s coughs were so forceful
that they almost blew the funnel and tape away from her mouth before Debra had
a chance to remove them. �What did you give me?� Kim screamed at the women.
�None of your business!� Debra shot back. �You signed up to be a test subject
and we are testing on you! Besides, it would ruin all the fun!�

&nbsp;

It was hard for Kim to keep
from vomiting, but she thought things would be made worse if she did. The two
women had temporarily moved away from her and were discussing something in
hushed tones. After several minutes they returned and Debra jotted down some
notes as Evelyn described some of her observations of Kim�s outward condition. 

&nbsp;

Unpleasant effects were now
creeping up on Kim, and Evelyn was carefully observing the discomfort. �Blind
as a bat, mad as a hatter, red as a beet, hot as a hare, dry as a bone, the
bowel and bladder lose their tone, and the heart runs alone, right Alice?� Evelyn
whispered into Kim�s ear and gave it a little lick. This was a mnemonic
describing the effects of Scopolamine poisoning and even had a name: �The
Alice in Wonderland effect�.� 

&nbsp;

The two Cheshire Cats were smiling down at Kim/Alice, one now with a camera
taking pictures of her dilated eyes. Tumbling down the dark rabbit hole, she
fell and fell, the cats chasing after her while snapping pictures and laughing.
It was hard to breathe; it seemed the air was thick and sticky, like trying to
breathe in syrup. Was there any oxygen down here? Panic set in. She would do
anything to get back up to the surface�anything. 

&nbsp;

She would do anything.
