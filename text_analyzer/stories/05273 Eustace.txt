As Eustace scrubbed his chest, his dick bounced between his
legs,
and he was overcome with the desire to touch it. I have to clean it,
don't I? Eustace thought. But he'd already washed it a bit...too
much!

My wife will cause me grief, he mentally reminded himself.

Opal had her rules. Just the other day she'd cought
Eustace rubbing
his Supertube, though that wouldn't have much effect
on Eustace's
crotch, since his cock was so well crushed in there...

But his wife been furious! Opal had unlocked Eustace's
penis. &quot;So
you want a little attention, so much that you rub your dick through
your tube, eh?&quot;

Opal had rubbed Eustace's dick, ordering him to hold his hands
behind his head...

And, after Eustace had become erect, Opal had gotten a metal ruler.

WHACK! WHACK! WHACK!

Eustace's dick had gone down and it had been a horrible effort to
keep his hands behind his head.

Then Opal had stroked him back to a hard-on with her Lubriderm...

Eustace had begged, &quot;Please, Miss Opal...don't do this to me.&quot; But
she'd just smiled, stroking with her long French nails until he was
fully erect again....

And Opal knew every inch of Eustace's dick...she knew where to rub
and where to tickle, and she was completely in control of her
husband's sensitive frenulum, which just drove him
wild!

Then she'd gone and gotten her rattan cane. Opal had raised it,
watching Eustace weeping in anticipation as his dick had stuck out,
thick with the rage of 83 days of no orgasms...

SNAP ! The first time the rattan had landed on Eustace's dick,
his
arms had immediately left the back of his neck, and he'd grabbed his
penis, rolling around on the floor, and crying.

Opal had immediately used the cane to whack Eustace all over his
bare butt and body until he'd climbed back up and put his hands
behind his head again...and she'd whacked his dick into
limpness...and he'd not touched it, even through the SuperTube
again!

Now, he knew he had to resist the temptation to soap his penis...he
knew he had to...this was such a soothing shower!

And, Eustace's dick still felt squished from last night, when he was
fucking Opal with that horrible eight inch dick, that she'd
attached
over his chastity belt.

How Opal had screamed while Eustace had fucked her with that damn
thing, and how Eustace's dick had felt so horrible squished in the
SuperTube. She'd cum and cum again, and Eustace had
slammed the
plastic eight inch dildo home...but there had been tears in his eyes
when Opal had rolled over and gone to sleep.

Eustace finished showering, and stepped out of the tub. Oh, look at
his cock. Eustace's cock was quite stiff and overwhelmingly red,
though he'd just brushed it by while washing. Opal's rules about
Eustace touching his cock, even while bathing, were quite clear.

&quot;You are not to touch your penis, Eustace.&quot; Opal would say again and
again. Most of the time, Eustace's dick was Eustacefined
in the
Supertube, which prevented erections and certainly
access by
Eustace, who was a horny bastard at the best or worst of times.

The bathroomd oor opeend and Opal looked in, as Eustace was rubbing
a towel over his head. He smiled at Opal, who was resplendent in an
enchanting, snug purple velour turtleneck.

Opal came forward. &quot;Hello, darling.&quot; She
took Eustace's dick in her
hand and began playing with it. It was amazing how Opal's tiny hand
could so stimulate Eustace's huge pecker.

What a slender girl she was, with such big breasts!

Opal tickled and tickled, and Eustace began to gasp...

Oooh.

&quot;You had an accident! It's all over my beautiful top!&quot; Opal
screamed. &quot;I'm getting the bullwhip! Accidents are outlawed in this
house!&quot;

Accidents shouldn't happen, Eustace thought, weeping bitterly. But, as Opal
approached with the bullwhip, the phone rang and she picked it up. &quot;Hello?
Yes, this is Landon President Eustace Smallwood's residence...&quot; 

&nbsp;

Opal handed the phone to Eustace. &quot;We'll deal with your
error later.&quot; she said meaningfully, and walked into the kitchen.

&nbsp;

Eustace took the phone. &quot;This is President
Smallwood.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;This is a reporter for the Providence Journal-Bulletin,
President Smallwood. There are strange goings on at
the Kappa Gamma Sade sorority house--&quot;

&nbsp;

Eustace laughed. &quot;Yes, I know every day there's been
something new and strange since the KGS house&nbsp;first got their charter in
1921. Good day&quot; Eustace hung up, shaking his head.

&nbsp;

It was so funny--Eustace's entire life seemed to
have been encapsuled within the Kappa Gamma Sades... 

&nbsp;

Eustace's grandfather, H. Pettibone
Smallwood had been Registrar at Landon, and had cautiously dated the attractive
Suellen Pearson, a KGS sophomore...

&nbsp;

It would have been a scandal, had Grandma not been
so commanding a nineteen year old, and heads still buzzed about how she'd caned
Gramps's bare bottom the year after she married him,
at a family reunion.

&nbsp;

Grandma was a strict Mommy, but quite attractive, and
Eustace had heard that his own father, Eustace Smallwood, Sr. had had a wild
streak, but that Grandma had changed him from &quot;Eustace&quot; to
&quot;Stacey&quot; and raised him as a girl.

&nbsp;

Grandma had sent Stacy to Landon, free as a son of the Registrar.
Eustace,Sr./Stacey had met
Myrtle, his roommate at Kappa Gamma Sade, in 1941. 

Myrtle had been delighted that she had a tranny
roommate, and immediately after unpacking her box, she'd kicked poor Stacy in
the nuts, and made him scrub the floor with a sponge in his teeth!

&nbsp;

Myrtle and Stacey were married in 1943, right before Stacey
had to resume men's clothes to go off and fight in the Pacific. Two years
later, Eustace, Jr. was born. 

When Stacey came home, he finished up at Landon, getting a Master's in Library
Science, and he became the Landon Librarian.

&nbsp;

Eustace wanted no part of the femdom
lifestyle, and watching his father routinely humiliated and cuckolded by Mom
was just repulsive to him. &quot;I am not going to Landon, Mom, and I'm not
going anywhere near those freaks at Kappa Gamma Sade.&quot;

&nbsp;

Eustace's parents were not as commanding as Grandma, and let
Eustace go his own way...but unfortunately, &quot;Juicin'
Eustace&quot; as their son was known for his immoderate use of alcohol, was
kicked out of two prep schools and five colleges.

&nbsp;

&quot;It's your choice, Eustace&quot; Dad said to him sadly.
&quot;We've wiped out our savings paying for all these schools, and now your
only choice is Landon, tuition-free because I'm a Librarian, and Mom is the
Bursar. If you don't go to Landon, you'll be drafted and have to go to Vietnam
.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;No no...&quot; Eustace said,
moodily. &quot;I don't want to go into the Army...I hear&nbsp;they make
you&nbsp;get up early in the morning.&quot; 

&nbsp;

But Eustace knew he didn't want to go anywhere near the
Kappa Gamma Sade House. Dad and Gramps had been
subjugated, no drinking, no poker, no fun, housework, being cuckolded...ugh.

&nbsp;

And so Eustace started at Landon---and it wasn't so bad! No
one was involved in the fraternity movement anymore--most of the frats and
sorority houses were closing down, and the kids were into free love and protest
marches...Eustace was getting lots of sex, and doing drugs now in addition to
his &quot;juicing&quot;.

And yes,the girls at Landon
were beautiful! But he noticed that the KGS girls were the absolute prettiest.
Kappa Gamma Sade was the lone sorority house where
girls still wore&nbsp; makeup, tight pink sweaters and
short wool skirts and high heels...in a sea of hippie chicks with ironed hair
and flowered miniskirts.

&nbsp;

And Eustace somehow got into a conversation with Opal
Corbett, a curvy little blonde thing in a snug white turtleneck standing in
front of the KGS house in the spring of 1969. 

&nbsp;

At twenty-four but still a junior because of his academic
malfeasance, Eustace was used to being able to out-class the callow youths who
were his peers. The girls liked him! But Opal didn't seem all that impressed.


Eustace looked at Opal suspiciously. &quot;Everyone is growin' our hair like this. We're part of a
rebellion!&quot; He smirked. &quot;You're the weirdos
on campus now, the Greek system is dead...we have protest marches, draft cards
to burn, acid to drop and&nbsp;grass to smoke!&quot;

&quot;You see, Opal, it's all about individualism&quot; Eustace said pompously.

The little blonde looked up at Eustace and ran a long pink tongue over her full
underlip. &quot;But if everyone is dressed in gunny
sacks like you are, avoiding those four letter words like s-o-a-p, w-o-r-k, and&nbsp; w-a-s-h, where's the nonconformity?&quot; 

&nbsp;

She'd turned on her heel, and Eustace, resplendent in his
tie-dyed shirt and dirty overalls had watched&nbsp; Opal's
little butt twitch into the KGS house.

When Eustace had called the KGS house to demand that Opal meet him for coffee
to debate the matter further, she'd said, &quot;I don't go out with hoboes. If
you want to take me out to dinner, show up Friday night at seven sharp in a
suit and tie, with your hair cut.&quot;

Eustace had spluttered in rage. That arrogant little bitch.
He wasn't asking her on a date, he wanted to explain...but somehow it happened.

&nbsp;Eustace canceled&nbsp;an engagement&nbsp;to drop acid and eat mushrooms
with his steady, Moon-Pie Mullins, and got his hair cut...just in case Opal
didn't like the length, he asked for a crewcut.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Eustace had barely spoken to Stacey, his tranny
dad, ever since he'd learned that Mom and Grandma had recently iced down
Stacey's testicles and cut them off, but still, Eustace dropped by the library
to ask Dad for a little green to take Opal out.

&quot;She's a nice girl&quot; Stacey responded in his new, somewhat high
pitched voice. The new estrogen treatments seemed to be changing Dad in so many
ways, Eustace thought...

&quot;Well, she's a KGS, but I'm not going to date her for long, I just want to
show her--&quot;

Stacey handed Eustace the needed cash, and shook his head, smiling. &quot;The
girls at KGS are wonderful, son.

&nbsp;

With all the objections you have to our lifestyle, you can't
say that your mother and I didn't treat you and your brothers and sisters
well...we gave you all you wanted, and we were happy, right, Eustace?&quot;

Eustace had to admit that, but still, he didn't want to get involved with a
woman who was going to control him. &quot;Say, Dad, I don't want to take my VW
Bug to meet Opal, can I borrow your Caddy?&quot;

Dinner went well, Opal was a witty conversationalist,and Eustace began to wonder if he should get a
little closer to her. He asked her out again.

On their third date, Eustace leaned over in the big, roomy Caddy and put his
arm around her, as they watched a drive-in movie.


&nbsp;

Opal met Eustace�s lips in a strong kiss, and they began
necking, but as Eustace�s hands pawed Opal�s breasts, he felt a whack across
his face. 

&nbsp;

�What� what�s wrong?� Eustace asked. No girl had ever
slapped him before, they�d been responding to his advances cheerfully since
he�d first gotten laid in a closet at Pomeroy
 Dancing School
in seventh grade.

&nbsp;

�You were reaching for my honeys, and I don�t just let
anyone touch them.� Opal was a little informal that night, and she was in a
pink T-shirt, and her �honeys� were quite beautiful. 

&nbsp;

All of Eustace�s friends, horrified that their hippie leader
had changed his entire appearance had at least understood his desire to touch
the orbs of the Ice Princess. �I might wear a bow tie for those tits too� said
the president of the local Weatherman�s Underground.

&nbsp;

So Eustace went back to kissing Opal, and she became quite
passionate, but when he forgot again, and grabbed her boobs, she raked her red
nails across his face. Then Eustace felt her high heel kick him in the stomach,
and all of a sudden he'd fallen out of the car!

&nbsp;

As Eustace got up, he saw Opal slam the door and start Dad's
Caddy, and drive off, and he'd had to walk back from Inspiration Point. Later
when Eustace had shown up at his parents house
(already having been kicked out of the Landon dorm for too much partying) he
saw the Caddilac in the driveway, with the keys on
the dashboard.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Later on, Eustace saw Opal&nbsp; talking to a couple of interested guys outside an �Introduction to the Francophone World&nbsp;� class. Opal
looked just beautiful! Her hair was up in a bun and she was wearing a tight burgundy
off shoulder sweater dress, the hemline stopping just at the beginning
of her thighs.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;Eustace
approached her, overhearing&nbsp; her say �I�m so
interested in the French presence in the Antilles .�

&nbsp;

Eustace,
in his usual pushy way, shoved in front of the geek Opal was talking to. �Look
here, that was some stunt you pulled��

&nbsp;

&nbsp;But
before he could say anything else, Opal lashed out a knee, kicking Eustace
severely in the nuts, and he fell down, moaning, and she turned to the other
guys and continued&nbsp; her conversation.

&nbsp;

But
Eustace was not to be put off, and he showed up at the KGS house later on,
enraged. �I don�t care how long it takes to get her down here� he said to the
transvestite at the switchboard. �I want to see her!�

&nbsp;

Finally,
Opal came downstairs, now in a scoop necked navy dress. As her manicured hands
curled over the banister, she smiled at Eustace. �So, big boy�you can�t stay
away, eh?�

&nbsp;

�You
make me sick. I don�t know that I want to see you again after the way you
assaulted me.� Eustace turned as if to go, and he heard a peal of feminine
laughter.

&nbsp;

Turning
around, he watched in alarm as Opal walked back upstairs. �Wait! Where are you
going? I didn�t mean it!�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;Opal
shook her head and Eustace couldn�t get her to come downstairs until suddenly,
he began to cry, something he�d not done since childhood.

&nbsp;

Opal
came downstairs, and took Eustace by the sleeve and brought&nbsp;
him back up the stairs to her room.

&nbsp;

Finally Opal got into the room, where her roommate was
slapping the face of a sobbing freshman girl.&nbsp; �Rosalind, could you take
it outside, hon?�

&nbsp;

Rosalind took a look at Eustace�s tear stained face. �Good,someone is finally giving it
the Juicer!� Even the freshman girl smiled briefly, before Rosalind grabbed her
by the ponytail and dragged her out of the room.

&nbsp;

As Eustace stood there, Opal sat down and crossed her long,
shapely legs. She folded her hands in her lap and smiled at him. �Now then, who
was it who was behaving badly last night?� 

&nbsp;

Opal slowly ran her right hand, dainty, white and crimson
tipped, across her generous bosom.

&nbsp;

�Who was it that couldn�t control himself?� Opal smiled at
Eustace�s reddening face. �Why on earth should I go out with a drooling, pawing
boor?�

&nbsp;

Eustace shook his head. Girls didn�t usually behave like
this. 

&nbsp;

Once he�d thrown a girl out of his off-campus apartment at Dartmouth
because she�d asked why he had another girl�s cosmetics in his bathroom. And
this had been AFTER she�d given him a blowjob.

&nbsp;

�I think maybe we aren�t meant to see each other, Eustace.�
Opal said gently. �I like a man who is more, shall we say gentle, and less
willful. You don�t appear to be able to control yourself.� 

&nbsp;

She paused. �People laugh at you, your drinking escapades,
being on academic probation, the pot busts, your numerous car wrecks..even those idiots you call
your friends are constantly borrowing your money and trying to make time with
the sluts that you date�

&nbsp;

And even they laugh about what a partying loser you are. If
you wanted to be the person I know you are inside, I might relent, but I don�t
think you are ready for that maturity yet.�

&nbsp;

Eustace looked at Opal dumbly. He knew she was right. She
was funny and smart and beautiful, and he knew she cared about him. 

&nbsp;

And he knew she was the ONE . And now he would lose her. �Wh-what can I do to get you
back, Opal?�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�Well, I think you want to reform, but you need to sacrifice
a little bit to make it important to you.� Opal paused.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;�Eustace, you need to be punished. I read the Op-Ed
you wrote in the Lanham Loudmouth about how you didn�t think much of we Kappa Gamma Sade girls�you said
you would never let a girl dominate you. But I think you need it. Are you
willing to be punished?�

&nbsp;

Eustace struggled within. No, no�I can�t� But he knew he
would. �Whatever you want, Opal�Miss Opal.�

&nbsp;

That had been the last time he�d ever called her just Opal
again, when not in front of others. 

&nbsp;

Opal had merely snapped her fingers, and Eustace had
stripped off his clothes, folding them neatly in a corner of the room, and then
he�d lay down on the bed and she�d bound his ankles
together and his hands behind his back�and then she�d brought out the cane.

&nbsp;

After she�d reduced Eustace to a blubbering whale, Opal had
turned him over on his back and begun stroking his cock slowly with her long
red nails. 

&nbsp;

She still hadn�t taken off her dress, though she�d bent over
quite a bit so Eustace could stare into her cleavage.

&nbsp;

After she�d stroked Eustace for nearly an hour and a half,
talking softly to him as if to a baby, Opal had demanded that he go limp, and
he�d been indignant, as of course he�d thought she was going to untie him and
fuck him, or at least give him a hand job.

&nbsp;

When Eustace�s dick had stayed stiff, Opal had brought out
the cane and given him ten sharp thwacks on the glans,
and finally his wee-wee had become quite small. 

&nbsp;

She�d sent Eustace home, and he�d wondered when he would get
into her drawers, and his hands on those beautiful
breasts.

&nbsp;

He never did, really. Eustace never got to fuck Opal, though
she took his ass with her strap-on many times after that. 

&nbsp;

The first time he saw Opal fully naked was two years after
their marriage, in 1971, when he�d walked in on her fucking one of the janitors
from the Humanities Building.

&nbsp;

By then, Eustace was a physics instructor at Landon,
pursuing his Ph.D. in the Science Department, and as Opal gave him vicious
canings for grades less than 90% (and she checked all his tests,essays and quizzes) 

&nbsp;

Eustace got his Ph.D in record
time, and was chairman of the Landon Physics Department by 1982.

&nbsp;

�82 was also the year that Opal got Eustace his first
chastity device, not quite the Supertube, but it had
worked.

&nbsp;

Eustace was allowed to jerk off twice a week in 1982, once a
week in '84, and once a month in '90. Now, of course, it was just at darling
Opal's rare whim.

&nbsp;

But Opal, was wonderful! He'd still
never touched her breasts, even when he bathed her...but she was wonderful and
beautiful!

&nbsp;

Opal&nbsp;was now the mother of three children, two of which
looked like the janitor, and one like the bartender at Bristol �s
jumping singles club.

&nbsp;

The oldest, Eustace the Third, called Trey, had taken his
father's contemptous viewpoint on female domination.
Eustace had cringed under his son's cocked head as he scrubbed the kitchen
floor in a pink swimsuit while Mom was out with her male &quot;friend.&quot;

&nbsp;

But, when Trey began getting into drugs and skipping school
at thirteen, Opal had touched her husband's arm. &quot;Let him live it up...the
only college which will admit him will be Landon.&quot; 

&nbsp;

Suddenly Eustace had understood his own mother's
permissiveness!

&nbsp;

By then, in the late eighties, Eustace was college
president, and he understood the wisdom of his wife's words, and indeed by the
time Trey graduated from Landon in 1992, he was under the thumb of Brandi, his
KGS fiancee...Eustace noticed Trey's nails were
painted at graduation!

&nbsp;

Trey's sister, Lark had transformed Trey's best friend Todd
from a snarling Engineering student to a placid Ballet major...

&nbsp;

And their youngest daughter, darling Beth, was a junior
majoring in domming girls and boys at the Kappa Gamma
Sade House!

&nbsp;

So as Eustace Smallwood, Landon college
President, put the phone down and went in to face his wife's bullwhip, he
thought &quot;Yes, it's a strange sorority, but a necessary one, at least for
us Smallwoods!&quot;
