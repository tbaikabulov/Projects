Mary Had a
Little Lamb

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

��������������� I was digging through the stacks
of comic books in the dealer's room at the ComicCon in San Diego with Mistress
Minx indulgently waiting for me. I was looking for the rest of the Damage
Control comic series and was short only issue #1 when a young lady in a
RenFaire costume bumped into me, bodice first.

��������������� When I turned, I found myself
eye to cleavage with a wonderful set of breasts, the type you put your head on
and sleep against.

��������������� &quot;Excuse me,&quot; a voice
said from slightly higher than where I was looking and blushing, I looked up
into the face of a young woman with red hair and green eyes who wore a look of
tolerant amusement.

��������������� &quot;Sorry, didn't mean to get
in your way,&quot; I apologized, conscious of Minx's watching eye.

��������������� &quot;Not at all. I was just
trying to get to that issue of X-men,&quot; she said easily.

��������������� &quot;He's a bit obstructive at
times,&quot; Minx offered. &quot;I'm Minx and the gentleman, using the term
loosely, who was staring at you is Michael.&quot;

��������������� &quot;I'm used to it by now.
Although I have been known to wear a button that says, &quot;YES THEY'RE REAL
and in very tiny print it reads AND SO IS THE GUN POINTED AT YOUR GONADS.&quot;

��������������� I snickered and Minx grinned as
she introduced herself as Marion,&quot; Also known on occasion as Maid Marion,
Made Marion, and Marion the librarian. My real name is Mary, but I prefer
Marion.&quot;

��������������� &quot;What must I do my dear, to
catch your ear?� I love you madly madly
madam librarian, Marion,&quot; I sang softly.

&quot;OK, you
made your point Michael,&quot; Minx scolded. &quot;Forgive him, he knows not
what he does.&quot;

��������������� &quot;Actually he knows exactly
what he's doing. He's flirting with me. And better than most too.&quot;

��������������� I resisted the urge to stick my
tongue out at the Mistress, remembering one previous time when I had done so
and then had a clamp put on it making me sound like Jar Jar Binks after being
zapped.

��������������� I reached out and retrieved the
X-men comic book that Marion had been reaching for and handed it to her.

��������������� She accepted it and then stepped
away to pay the vendor while I dug to the bottom of the stack to get my Damage
Control comic.

��������������� By the time I paid the vendor,
Marion had disappeared into the crowd leaving Minx and I to our shopping.

&nbsp;

��������������� We didn't see her again until
that evening after dinner when we saw her sitting on the floor in the hotel
lobby singing with a group of people. The song they were performing was one of
my favorites named The Scotsman a
song that deals with what a Scotsman doesn't wear beneath his kilts.

��������������� As they wrapped up the song I
turned to Minx and asked why Scotsmen still wear kilts.

��������������� &quot;Why?&quot; she asked
prepared to hear the worst.

��������������� &quot;Because sheep can hear
zippers,&quot; I replied straight-faced.

��������������� Minx groaned loudly as the song
finished and Marion looked up at her startled.

��������������� &quot;Was the singing that
bad?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Oh no, it
was his joke,&quot; Minx explained. &quot;It was awful.&quot;

��������������� &quot;What was it?&quot; Marion
prompted.

��������������� I repeated it to the groans from
the gathered assembly.

��������������� &quot;Well you have to feel
sorry for the sheep in that case. No foreplay or anything,&quot; Marion
commented rising from her seat on the floor.

��������������� &quot;Well what did you expect?
That the guy would sing, I only have eyes for ewe?&quot; I quipped.

��������������� &quot;Michael, one more word
from you and I'll make sure you don't have anything except the word ouch to say
for a very long time,&quot; Minx promised evilly.

��������������� I promptly mimed locking my
mouth shut and throwing the key away to Marion's amusement.

��������������� &quot;He seems well trained for
the most part,&quot; she commented as I did my best to look innocent.

��������������� &quot;For the most part. There
are times however when he needs to be reminded about who is in charge,&quot;
Minx said agreeably. &quot;On your knees Michael.&quot;

��������������� &quot;Not him, obviously,&quot;
Marion said with interest as I knelt before Minx, head bowed.

&quot;Not for a
long time now,&quot; Minx agreed. &quot;But he's a well loved pet.&quot;

��������������� I blushed as she reached out and
stroked my head.

��������������� &quot;Tell me, do you let
anybody else make use of him?&quot; Marion asked with a thoughtful expression.

��������������� &quot;I do on occasion. What did
you have in mind?&quot; Minx asked.

��������������� &quot;Can we talk somewhere
privately? I have an idea...&quot; Marion said.

��������������� &quot;Sit. Stay!&quot; I was
commanded and I watch Minx and Marion walk away from the corner of my eye.

��������������� &quot;Eyes front and down!&quot;
Minx called knowing somehow I was peeking.

��������������� I did as ordered and waited,
ignoring the people walking around me and the occasional laughter from the two
women.

��������������� &quot;Michael, come here like a
good puppy,&quot; Minx called.

��������������� I flopped to the floor and
hurried to her side on all fours to the amusement of most of the people
watching.

��������������� &quot;Woof?&quot; I barked
looking up at her.

��������������� &quot;Michael, Marion and I are
going out for a little while. You may stay here if you wish, or go to one of
the other functions, but I want you to be at our room and kneeling outside the
door at ten o'clock,&quot; Minx directed.

��������������� I cocked my head and nodded to
the smile of Marion.

��������������� &quot;Good puppy. What kind of
puppy are you? A St. Bernard? A cocker spaniel? Maybe a sheepdog,&quot; she
teased.

��������������� I looked up at Minx who smiled.
&quot;He's been a fox and a pig in his life. As a dog though, I have to say
he's a mutt,&quot; she explained. &quot;Lovable and loyal.&quot;

��������������� I panted in response as the two
women walked out, but not before Marion scratched behind my ears lightly.

&nbsp;

��������������� &quot;Well, the game is afoot
Watson,&quot; I said to myself, rising from the floor and pulling the
convention schedule from my pocket.

I scanned it and
noticed that the ConFurEnce group was hosting a showing of Road Rovers, a
cartoon featuring anthropomorphic dogs. I have to admit I'm a sucker for that
type of cartoon, and do try and attend conventions of Furry Fandom whenever I
can.

��������������� I guess having done some of the
things I've done; I can identify with them.

&nbsp;

��������������� I had a good time at the video
showing and saw a few of my old fur friends, including the one who comes to
conventions with his own supply of dog bones made from gingerbread.

��������������� They're good too.

��������������� The one thing I didn't do
however was fail to keep a close eye on the time. When Mistress Minx wants you
at a certain place at a certain time, she does mean it. I just wasn't sure what
idea Marion had proposed that Minx had agreed to.

��������������� I'd find out though. That much I
was sure of.

&nbsp;

��������������� I was in the appointed place at
the appointed time, head down and waiting just at the stroke of ten.

��������������� The door opened before me and
then I was told to close my eyes. I did and was soon hooded and my glasses
removed for safekeeping. I felt a collar fastened around my neck and was tugged
into the room for whatever awaited me.

��������������� &quot;Stand up and strip
Michael,&quot; Minx commanded,&quot; and remain standing.&quot;

��������������� I did as I was told, staggering
slightly as I kicked my boots off, and feeling the steadying touch of a warm
hand.

��������������� &quot;Now hold still while we
dress you,&quot; I was ordered.

��������������� I felt something furlike wrapped
around my legs and then something else pulled up between my legs like a diaper.
It was slightly irritating to the skin, but I pushed that from my mind, intent
on deciphering the type of fabric now being entwined around my outstretched
arms. It smelled slightly of baby oil, confusing me even more.

��������������� &quot;Arms over your head,&quot;
Marion ordered firmly.

��������������� I complied and felt more of the
fabric slid down over my torso and then a series of tugs and snaps.

��������������� I felt my skin completly covered
in this substance except for the area around my ass, my cock being trapped
inside the covering.

��������������� &quot;On all fours
Michael,&quot; Minx commanded and I somewhat stiffly assumed the commanded
position.

��������������� &quot;Oh wait. On your knees,
&quot; she countermanded.

��������������� I rose onto my knees and then
felt gloves being slid onto my hands, restraining my fingers from gripping.

��������������� &quot;Now, on all fours,&quot;
Minx said.

��������������� I assumed the position once
again and then felt a cap of some kind slid onto my head. 

��������������� &quot;Keep your eyes
closed,&quot; I was commanded.

��������������� I felt the hood pulled and then
cold on my eyes and the sound of tearing cloth.

��������������� &quot;Now open them,&quot; Minx
said, and I opened them to find myself looking at the leather clad form of my
Mistress standing before me and Marion sitting in a chair, wearing a plaid
skirt and a green silk corset that made her even more impressive in the frontal
shelf.

��������������� &quot;Perhaps a few bars of
Marisy Doats would be appropiate at this point,&quot; Marion suggested.

��������������� I wasn't quite sure what she
meant until I looked down at my arms and found them wrapped in fleece.

��������������� &quot;Baa!&quot; I bleated
sheepishly, realizing what I was wearing at least.

��������������� &quot;Humbug,&quot; Minx replied
with a laugh. &quot;Now you can truly say you have your sheepskin.&quot;

��������������� It was hard not to laugh at
that, but I knew if I did, I'd be in worse trouble.

��������������� Minx led me into the bedroom of
our suite where I could see all of myself in a mirror.

��������������� She had taken two sheepskin seat
covers and made a crude pair of pajamas that I was encased in, using fleece
lined gloves for the hands after turning them inside out and stitching the
thumb and fingers together to restrict my grip. On my head was a wool cap with
little ears attached to it.

��������������� She allowed me to look at myself
for a minute, then led me back into the main room where she had me stop in
front of the chair that Marion was sitting in.

��������������� &quot;I think he came out rather
well,&quot; Minx said. &quot;I would never have thought of it.&quot;

��������������� &quot;Well we'll find out in a
minute or two how well,&quot; Marion said. &quot;He needs a name though. How
about Lambert? Or Lamb Chop?&quot;

��������������� Minx shook her head.

��������������� &quot;Sacrificial, I think.
Because that's what he's going to be for you while I watch,&quot; Minx said
brightly.

��������������� I looked towards her confused.
Sacrificial did not sound at all good.

��������������� Marion pushed my head back
towards her and pulled up her skirt to reveal a strap on dildo.

��������������� &quot;Now you know what a
Scotswoman wears beneath her kilt as well,&quot; she said and pulled my face
into her crotch.

��������������� I sucked her rubber phallus and
pushed into her, taking it into my mouth and throat while Minx spanked my
uncovered ass forcing me to take it further into my mouth. I could hear Marion
become more aroused and the smell of her womanhood mixed with the smell of the
lanolin of the sheepskin filled my senses. I felt myself becoming aroused, even
more so when Minx brushed her hand lightly across my cock making it move in
reaction to her touch.

��������������� &quot;I think that's
enough,&quot; Minx said pulling my head from between Marion's thighs.
&quot;Now, turn around my lamb.&quot;

��������������� I turned around and then felt my
asshole being played with gently, then a warm liquid being applied to it. I
moaned as I felt a finger probe me and then gritted my teeth as a larger object
slid in filling me. I felt Marion hands grip my wooly skin and pull me back
into her.

��������������� &quot;Now you know how the sheep
felt. At least I used a little oil on you,&quot; she said softly as she thrust
herself into me further.

��������������� I bleated as she increased her
rhythm, thrusting into me faster as Minx stroked my head and then releasing my
head started stroking my cock.

��������������� &quot;Must be a transsexual
sheep, because it's got a cock,&quot; Minx said.

��������������� Marion half laughed as she
pushed herself into me and then I felt the shudder against my body of her
orgasm.

��������������� &quot;Oh Goddess, I haven't done
that in a long time,&quot; she panted. &quot;I want more. He's so tight and the
soft wool feels so good against me. You should try it.&quot;

��������������� &quot;No, tonight he's your fuck
animal. I'm enjoying watching you. I love watching another woman make
love,&quot; Minx said.

��������������� &quot;I just wish I could cum up
his ass. That's the one thing you can't do very well with a dildo,&quot; Marion
said, laying on top of me, the strap on slipping out of me with a wet sound.

��������������� &quot;Oh I have a solution for
that,&quot; Minx said moving away from me.

��������������� I lay on the floor, eyes closed,
sore and aroused, my cock throbbing from Minx's attentions and the submission
to Marion's desires.

��������������� I heard Marion giggle and Minx
say &quot;It's works for some lesbian couples you know.&quot;

��������������� &quot;And where are you going to
get the cum?&quot; Marion asked.

��������������� &quot;Isn't it obvious? The
question is do you do it, or do I?&quot; Minx replied.

��������������� &quot;We could always have him
do it himself,&quot; Marion suggested.

��������������� &quot;Sheep don't
masturbate,&quot; Minx observed. &quot;He's mine though, so I'll do it. Get on
all fours again my lamb.&quot;

��������������� I assumed the position and felt
the firm grip on my cock of the Mistress's hand stroking me, running her thumb
over the head of it as I panted in helpless lust.

��������������� &quot;Yes my little one, cum for
me. Show Marion how much cum you have from her fucking that slutty ass of
yours,&quot; she teased. &quot;There's a cup under you just waiting to be
filled.&quot;

��������������� I moaned and then exploded my
load, groaning as she milked every drop out of my cock.

��������������� &quot;Good boy,&quot; she
whispered. &quot;Someday I'll use you at stud with a nice little slave
bitch.&quot;

��������������� I shuddered and shot again as
Marion laughed.

��������������� &quot;What did you say to
him?&quot; she asked.

��������������� &quot;It's a family secret,&quot;
Minx said. &quot;Now for the piece de resistance.&quot;

��������������� &quot;That piece won't resist.
Much at least,&quot; Marion said slapping my ass and running the tip of the
dildo across my asshole.

��������������� I tried not to tighten up and
relax, closing my eyes. I heard a sucking sound and then felt something
slightly pointed slide into my asshole and then the sensation of a warm fluid
filling me.

��������������� &quot;It's not quite the same as
doing it yourself, but it works,&quot; Marion said before I felt her dildo
slide up me again forcing the liquid deeper inside.

��������������� &quot;Now I think you should
thank Marion for showing you what a sheep feels like in the hands of a
Scotsman,&quot; Minx suggested.

��������������� &quot;Thank you for using me for
your pleasure,&quot; I bleated in my best Scots brogue.

��������������� The dildo probed deeper into me
in response and which point my mind let go and I started humming.

��������������� &quot;Mary had a little lamb ...
&quot;
