SUCH A SIMPLE THING . . .

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The interesting thing is, I never knew.

&nbsp;

All those years wondering why I had such a
low sex drive.� Even during my
first marriage, we�d fuck and I�d lose interest for a week.� It wasn�t that I couldn�t attract women.� I�m reasonably attractive and not all that
shy.� That wasn�t the problem. �I simply lost interest.

&nbsp;

Nobody ever told me why . . . until I had a routine physical
checkup three years ago.

&nbsp;

�Anybody ever check your
testosterone count?� asked the doc.

&nbsp;

�No, should they?�

&nbsp;

�Well, there�s no special reason, but some guys like to
know.�

&nbsp;

I told him to go ahead.�
Why not?� What did I know?

&nbsp;

A week later a routine lab report arrived at my
apartment.� It said my testosterone count
was way down on the low side for an adult male.�
Of course, it didn�t really tell me what that meant, so I headed for the
Internet.

&nbsp;

Wow.

&nbsp;

No wonder I�d lose interest.�
Seemed I was creating so little testosterone it took a few days to build
up a level of interest again after an orgasm.

&nbsp;

That was a bummer, to be sure.

&nbsp;

But, as it turned out, it was the beginning of a wonderful
new sex life.

&nbsp;

It started a couple months later.� I was feeling horny and spent a few hours
drinking at a neighborhood bar.�
Eventually I noticed a sexy young brunette at a corner table.� She seemed to be alone.� Nobody joined her for an hour.� A couple of guys tried, but she shooed them
away.

&nbsp;

I�m not sure what caused me to walk over and ask if I could
buy her a drink, but I did.� And I was
surprised when she looked me over for a moment and then said, �Sure.�

&nbsp;

Two hours later we were back at my apartment.� I was a little drunk and before I knew it she
was on top of me, riding herself to an orgasm.� I started to move with her, but she looked
down and gasped �Wait!�� I did my best and
managed to hold back until she finished, then rolled off me.� We lay there for a few moments and I started
to stroke her side.� She turned toward me
and looked me in the eyes.

&nbsp;

�Can you do that again?� she asked.

&nbsp;

�What?�

&nbsp;

�Bring me off without cuming yourself?�

&nbsp;

I was stunned at her question, but I could feel my cock
getting even harder.� Unbelievable!� So I said, �Yeah, I can do that . . . �

&nbsp;

She told me to mount her, and I did, then
started moving in and out of her, slowly at first, then with increasing
speed.� I could feel the buildup starting
deep inside my cock, but I resisted, even when she started to buck wildly
beneath me.� She erupted with a scream
and kept crying out for almost 30 seconds � and, somehow, I held myself back.

&nbsp;

Once she collapsed she looked up at me and said, �Pull it
out!�

&nbsp;

�What?� I said.� �What
about me?�

&nbsp;

She just smiled and pushed upwards on my chest.� I pulled out and rolled over on my back.� Neither of us said anything for a couple of
minutes.

&nbsp;

Then, gently, I felt her hand moving across my thigh,
finally grasping my erect (very
erect!) member.� She began to stroke it,
curling her fingers around the base of my cock-head, sliding her hand up and
down the shaft.� I was delirious with
pleasure and readied myself to explode.

&nbsp;

Just as I reached the brink, she stopped.� I actually gasped out loud.� �What are you doing?� I moaned.

&nbsp;

�Didn�t you like that?� she asked.

&nbsp;

�Yeah, yeah, I did,� I whispered as I tried to catch my
breath.� �But . . .�

&nbsp;

�Don�t try to figure it out,� she said. ��Just enjoy it.�

&nbsp;

We spent the next six hours together.� I brought her off three more times and I
never did cum, not even at the end.

&nbsp;

She left, and I lay there, my cock like an iron bar and my
body so aroused I couldn�t believe it.

&nbsp;

The next few days were agonizing.� Not only did I not lose interest, I couldn�t
think about anything else.� And I
realized I�d had one of the sexiest nights I�d ever had � and wanted more.

&nbsp;

I went back to the same bar every night that week, looking
for her.� She hadn�t given me her name or
her phone number, and she didn�t come back to the bar.� Not for a week.

&nbsp;

Finally, I saw her walking in from my perch at the table
where we�d first met.� She stood in the
doorway awhile and I hungered after her.�
She was about five-five, 120 pounds, with large breasts and a narrow
waist.� Long dark hair
and black boots up to her knees.�
She was wearing jeans and a tight black t-shirt that accentuated her
curves.

&nbsp;

As she stood in the doorway, her eyes searched the room �
and when they fell on me, she smiled and started over.

&nbsp;

�Can I join you?� she asked.

&nbsp;

I just smiled and waved a hand at the chair next to me.� She sat down and grinned, then put her hand
on my thigh, rubbing it a bit.� My cock
nearly burst through my jeans.

&nbsp;

We didn�t say much for the next few minutes, just sensed
each other . . . but an hour later we were back at my apartment.

&nbsp;

She told me her name.�
Jane.� She gave me her phone
number.� And then she told me her rules.

&nbsp;

�When I�m with you,� she said, �whether it�s at your place or
mine, I want you entirely naked the entire time.� I want to see what�s happening with your
cock.� And there�s one thing you must remember:� I own
that cock.� You aren�t allowed to touch
it, either when you�re with me or when we�re apart, unless I give you
permission.� And your cock isn�t the only
thing I own � I also own your orgasm.�
You don�t have one unless I tell you it�s
okay.�

&nbsp;

By this time my cock was bouncing it was so hard.

&nbsp;

�You like those rules, don�t you?� she grinned, and I just
nodded.� I couldn�t believe what was
happening to me.� But, somewhere in the
back of my mind, I understood:� The
testosterone would continue to build.� It
wouldn�t be drained away.� I�d stay hard
and I�d stay turned on.� And by this time
I realized how exciting, how pleasurable, how frustrating and how tantalizing
it could be to be right at the brink, all the time, and never tip over.

&nbsp;

�One more thing,� she added, her grin even wider, �and this
isn�t something I even have to say out loud.�
But I will.� You�re going to discover
that the longer you go without an orgasm, the more you�ll want to please me, the more you�ll want to touch me, the more you�ll want
to fuck me, with your lips, your hands, and even with your cock.� That�s a rule, actually:� You have to do anything I tell you to do
sexually, whenever I tell, without protesting.�
It�s a rule � but, really, you won�t be able to help yourself once
you�re completely frustrated.� You�ll do
anything I say.�

&nbsp;

Turns out she was right.�
The more she teased me, the more times I fucked her, the more times she
brought me to the brink and stopped � the more I wanted her and the more I was
willing to do anything she asked.

&nbsp;

Jane spends a couple of nights a week with me.� We�re thinking about getting married.� I�ve known her for almost three years and
I�ve never had an orgasm with her in
the room.� Sometimes, as she leaves
she�ll give me permission to jack off, but she makes me promise I�ll do it as
quickly as I can and without fantasizing � she wants it to give me as little
pleasure as possible.� Actually, the only
times she lets me cum are when she knows she�ll be away for at least five days
(of course, she never tells me at the beginning of the evening that this will
be one of those nights, so I never really think about it).� She wants me to masturbate as soon as she
leaves, then start thinking about her again.�
By the time she sees me a few days later, I�m fully primed.

&nbsp;

I�m not sure how that will play out if we�re married and
living in the same place.� But it might
be okay:� We both travel a lot on
business, so we�ll probably work my masturbation into our travel schedules.

&nbsp;

For all I know, Jane has other lovers.� She never speaks of them and never tells me
much about what she does when we�re apart.�
If we wind up living together, I expect she�ll occupy her nights on the
road however she wishes.� But she made it
clear early in our relationship that if I wanted to be with her I had to be a
one-woman man.� I asked her then if she�d
be a one-man woman, but she never answered.�
She just smiled.

&nbsp;
