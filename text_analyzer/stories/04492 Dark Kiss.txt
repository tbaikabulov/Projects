Dark Kiss

&nbsp;

�At last I have found you� 

&nbsp;

He whispered. His breath gentle against her neck, sending
shivers down her spine, leaning forward he grabbed a handful of her hair and
kissed her, hard and long, his fingers twisting cruelly in her hair.

&nbsp;

Pulling away, breathlessly, she stood there, her fingers
automatically going to her mouth and tracing her sore and swollen lips where
his kiss had left its trace, her eyes meeting with his for the briefest of
moments. She turned away, looking back down the darkened alleyway behind her.
Who was he? Where had he come from? Why wasn�t she afraid of him? She was
finding it difficult to breathe, her breath coming in short, sharp, gasps.

&nbsp;

�Who are you?�

&nbsp;

�Does it matter?� He said, a slight smile playing at the
corner of his lips.

&nbsp;

She stood there, unable to meet his eyes, feeling his gaze
upon her, burning into her very soul, she wanted to turn and run and yet was
unable to move, not understanding what was happening and realizing she didn�t
want to understand. She was caught in the moment, unable to do anything but stare
at the litter strewn street beneath her feet, her heart beating madly.

&nbsp;

�Look at me� putting his hand underneath her chin, he tilted
her face upwards.

&nbsp;

She didn�t want to look at him. She knew the moment she did
she would be lost. She tried to resist but it was futile, his will was stronger
than her own. Her eyes met his. His eyes were cold, held no warmth for her, yet
she couldn�t look away, she was shaking when he eventually pulled her close to
him, after spending what seemed like an eternity drowning in his eyes. She
gasped and closed her eyes leaning into him as she felt his arms slowly circle
her waist, his fingers trailing lazily over the small of her back.

&nbsp;

He let her go and held out his hand for her.

&nbsp;

�Come� she took his outstretched hand and allowed him to
lead her away from the town centre.

&nbsp;

�Where are we going?�

&nbsp;

�Home� he said, without looking at her.

&nbsp;

She looked up at him; for the first time taking in his
details, he was extremely good looking, long black wavy hair and piercing blue
eyes, tall with roguish good looks. He was the type of man that given the right
circumstances she would definitely look twice at. 

&nbsp;

She was afraid, excited and nervous all at the same time;
her stomach was doing little somersaults as she was led down unfamiliar roads.
At some point reality began to sink in and she wondered what the hell she was
doing, letting a complete stranger take her to who knows where and do god knows
what to her and she hadn�t even bothered to put up a struggle. There was
something familiar about him and she wanted to know more about this dark yet
intriguing stranger, even if it might mean her very life. Was she mad? She
didn�t care; a little part of her relished her recklessness. She wanted him, the
fire inside her getting hotter with every step she took.

&nbsp;

He opened the door and led her inside.

&nbsp;

�Well here we are, home sweet home� 

&nbsp;

He said, with a sweeping gesture of his arm. She looked
around the flat and shivered; it was dark, dank, cold and had a certain kind of
musty smell about it. The furniture was scarce and old, a single bed was
against one wall, with peeling pink flowered wallpaper and damp patches on the
ceiling, a three legged bedside table sat beside the bed, being supported by a
pile of books, an overstuffed armchair in one corner and a worn out coffee
table, which had definitely seen better days, was dead centre in the room.

&nbsp;

She stood there, in the middle of the room, feeling out of
place and not knowing quite what to do with herself; shyness had overtaken her
and her throat felt dry and useless, incapable of speech even if she wanted to.

&nbsp;

He walked over to her, put his hands on the back of her
shoulders and slowly turned her around so that she was facing him; she lowered
her eyes, taking in the details of the threadbare carpet, not sure what he
expected of her.

&nbsp;

�What do you want from me?� she asked, unconsciously
twisting her ring around her middle finger, a nervous habit of hers, which she
hadn�t quite been able to get out of.

&nbsp;

�You�

&nbsp;

�Me? Why?� 

&nbsp;

�Because it�s always been you�

&nbsp;

�What do you mean? I don�t understand�

You will� he turned, and walked away from her, heading into
the kitchen.

&nbsp;

�Sit� was his single command from the kitchen; she sat in
the overstuffed armchair, her head spinning, she was confused and had no idea
what she was doing here. What on earth had possessed her to follow a complete
stranger back to his flat?

&nbsp;

She glanced at the door, judging the distance and wondering
if she had the nerve or strength of will power to make a run for it. Before she
had quite made up her mind he came back in the room, with a steaming mug of
coffee in his hand.

&nbsp;

�Drink this� he handed her the mug and she took a sip, it
was good, exactly the way she liked it, she looked up at him, questioning, he
laughed and turned away, looking out of the murky window at the darkened
streets below.

&nbsp;

�I know many things about you�

&nbsp;

She was shaking so much it was hard to keep the mug of
coffee she still held in her hands still; she tried desperately not to spill
the coffee.

&nbsp;

�Maybe I owe you an explanation�

&nbsp;

�Would be a good start� she said, blowing unconsciously on
her coffee to try and cool it down a bit, before she scalded herself with it.

&nbsp;

�You have heard of reincarnation right?�

&nbsp;

�Hasn�t everybody?�

&nbsp;

�But do you believe it?�

&nbsp;

�I dunno, never really thought about it� she took another
sip of her coffee it was helping her to relax a little bit, she needed to
relax.

&nbsp;

�Do you think it�s possible for two people to be destined
for each other?�

&nbsp;

�What like fate, or summat?�

&nbsp;

�Lets try it another way shall we?�

&nbsp;

She looked at him dumbfounded, not at all sure what he was
on about and half convinced he was crazy.

&nbsp;

�How old would you say I am?

&nbsp;

�I�d say at a guess, mid-thirties�

&nbsp;

�Wrong, I am over one hundred years, and have been looking
for you for over seventy of them�

&nbsp;

She got up to leave, her earlier suspicions proved right, he
was crazy. In a flash he was up and blocking her way, pushing her gently but
firmly back down into the overstuffed armchair.

&nbsp;

�You were taken from me you see, in unfortunate
circumstances. Without you I only existed, my joy in life had gone, my nights
were spent in a drunken blur, then one night as I was staggering home I met
this stranger, he offered me back my life and a chance to find you again�

&nbsp;

She sat there staring at him, for once in her life at a loss
for words.

&nbsp;

�Quite simple really, all I had to do was drink his blood
and he mine�

&nbsp;

�I really think I should go now� but she made no attempt at
moving, just sat there, turning her now empty mug of coffee around in her
hands.

&nbsp;

�Why did you come with me tonight?�

&nbsp;

�I don�t know why�

&nbsp;

�You see! Your heart knows me, even if you do not�

&nbsp;

�This is bullshit and you know it!� She looked away out of
the window; she had to get away from here but how? She was trapped; there was
no way out.

&nbsp;

�Why didn�t you put up a struggle? Tell me! You could have
just turned around and run, yet you came!�

&nbsp;

�I was unable too, are you happy now? Something was pulling
me towards you and it was stronger than my desire to flee�

&nbsp;

�So you do feel it too?�

&nbsp;

�No� was all she could manage, her voice no more than a
whisper.

&nbsp;

�What did you feel when I kissed you?� 

&nbsp;

She looked away, tired of his questions, she didn�t want to
answer them, she knew that if she looked deep enough inside herself she would
find that what he was saying was true, her heart did know him and it was crazy
but she couldn�t deny the strange magnetic pull she felt towards him, had felt
it since their very first kiss.

&nbsp;

�Would you like me to kiss you again?�

&nbsp;

�I�.don�t know, maybe��yes�

&nbsp;

Taking the coffee cup from out of her hands and taking her
face in both of his he roughly kissed her, biting at her lips, bruising her,
drawing blood, tasting her, marking her as his.

&nbsp;

She closed her eyes and let his kiss take over her senses,
arching her back, leaning into him, offering herself more fully to him, nipples
erect, the fire within her turning into an inferno, needing the sweet surrender
of release. No longer certain about who she was or where she was but nothing
mattered, only the kiss fueling her desire mattered and him. She wanted him
with a hunger she hadn�t felt before. Sensing her weakness he stopped kissing
her, she looked up at him breathless, a trickle of blood running down her chin,
her need and want clearly visible in her eyes. Grasping her firmly by the hand
he led her over to the bed, forcing her shoulders down on the bed and parting
her thighs a little. She laid there looking up at him, her body shaking with
need, she knew she was wet, knew he could see the little damp patch showing on
her panties between her legs but she made no move to close her legs, knowing at
that minute she would do anything he asked, she closed her eyes letting her
primal instincts lead her into unknown territory. Looking down at her blatant
display of wantonness he smiled as he took off his shirt.

&nbsp;

�Now do you believe?�

&nbsp;

�Yes� 

&nbsp;

�Will you be mine?�

&nbsp;

�Yes�

&nbsp;

�Will you share this life with me?�

&nbsp;

�Yes�

&nbsp;

Reaching down and opening the bedside cabinet he took out
the small gilded dagger, drawing it slowly across his chest a thin red line
began to appear, she watched mesmerized as the blood, his blood, began to run
freely down his chest.

&nbsp;

In a daze, she sat up slowly and managed to shuffle her way
across the bed to where he stood waiting, folding her knees underneath her she
knelt before him, her hands grasping his hips, she looked up at him, meeting
his eyes, as though seeking permission. Looking down at her he placed his hands
on her head, stroking her long, dark mane of hair, gently guiding her head to
his chest.

&nbsp;

�Drink�

&nbsp;

Tentatively she snaked her tongue across his chest, sucking
occasionally at the open wound, not taking her eyes away from his, her
movements becoming frenzied. She closed her eyes, unable to focus any longer
and dug her nails deep into his hips, sucking and licking frantically, unable
to get enough, wanting more of what he had to offer her, her body needing more,
her senses more alive than they had ever been, her body reacting in a way that
surprised even her, she wanted him desperately inside her, needed her to take
her, make her his. Groaning he tilted his head back and tightened his grip on
her hair.

&nbsp;

�Enough�

&nbsp;

He moved his head away from his chest. She felt lost,
bereft, as though he had suddenly taken away a part of her.

&nbsp;

�My turn lay back on the bed�

&nbsp;

Still in a daze and not thinking clearly she lay back on the
bed, not able to take her eyes away from his.

&nbsp;

�Unbutton your blouse�

&nbsp;

With shaking fingers she started to unbutton her blouse,
knowing she wasn�t wearing a bra underneath. Feeling the cold air brushing
against her naked skin, she gently parted her blouse, giving him the perfect
view of her erect nipples and small but firm breasts. Keeping her arms
obediently by her side so as not to obstruct his view she waited with bated
breath for his next instruction. He stood looking down at her a few moments,
taking in the sight, before reaching out and gently running a forefinger over
each nipple, she shuddered, arching her body towards him, offering him her
breasts. He took her up on her invitation and cruelly pinched her nipples
between thumb and forefinger, making her cry out but still not pulling away
from his caress. Bending his head, he gently took her left nipple in his mouth,
sucking and pulling on it with his mouth, clamping his teeth around her nipple,
he firmly started to bite down, grabbing a handful of bed spread, her knuckles
turning white, she surrendered to his will, she was his, every fiber of her
body was screaming out to be used by him, in whichever way he wanted to use
her, she wanted him to possess her totally, until there was nothing of herself
left, only him. Lifting his head away from her breasts, his eyes met hers and
she knew in that instant she was lost, she�d do anything for him and go
anywhere with him.

&nbsp;

�Remove your skirt and panties, spread your legs�

&nbsp;

She nearly collapsed back down on the bed when she tried to stand;
her legs were shaking so much. He came and stood behind her, supporting her, as
she pulled her skirt down her shapely thighs and removed her panties. She stood
there naked and shaking; while he had his arm snaked about her waist helping
her to stay upright.

&nbsp;

�Back on the bed, legs spread; I want to see you, all of
you. You are to hide nothing from me�

&nbsp;

Lying back down on the bed, glad that she no longer had to
try to stand, she spread her legs for him, blushing slightly at the thought of
opening herself up so freely to somebody she only met a few hours ago. He stood
there looking down on her body, for what seemed to her forever, she could feel
her juices running freely down her legs and knew how turned on she was.

&nbsp;

�Spread your pussy lips for me�

&nbsp;

Moving her hands down between her legs, she grabbed each
side of her pussy and opened herself up wide, more open than any man had ever
seen her and closed her eyes as she felt his gaze move and linger on her
glistening pussy. She jumped when an exploratory finger began to probe deep
inside her but still managed to hold position, wanting more than anything to
please him, wanting to give herself to him, all of her and hold nothing back.
Two fingers now were gently rocking back and forth inside her, she could feel
herself responding to the movement of his fingers, thrusting her body up to
meet the thrust of his fingers, she heard him chuckle and then he removed his
fingers, wiping her own juices onto her thighs. She couldn�t hold back a
disappointed moan; she so desperately wanted to come, she didn�t care how.

&nbsp;

�Patience, my little one, patience�

&nbsp;

She could feel him taking position between her open legs,
feel his hot breath on her pussy, she couldn�t help but thrust her hot and
aching pussy up to meet his waiting mouth, opening her legs as wide as she
could get them, spreading her pussy lips further apart for him, silently
begging him to let her come. She felt his mouth cover her clitoris and she
almost passed out, the pleasure was so intense.

&nbsp;

�Do not come yet, wait for me�

&nbsp;

Holding her clitoris between his teeth he gently but
forcefully began tugging on it. Her breathing was becoming heavier, her whole focus
was on her pussy and she so desperately needed to come, only just managing to
hold it back for him. His mouth left her pussy and she nearly cried out until
she felt him at her entrance, with one single thrust he was all the way in to
the hilt, as deep in her as he could possibly get. Taking a handful of her
hair, he yanked her head to the side, exposing the vein in her neck, she
wrapped her arms around him as she felt his teeth sinking into her neck and he
began to suck, she held onto him as though her life depended on it. She could
hear her heart beating a steady rhythm, getting slower and slower the more he
took from her. He held her tightly as he sucked thirstily at her neck and
pounded into her pussy with his cock. She couldn�t hold back any longer, she
came, with a soul shattering scream, every muscle in her body tense and
quivering with pure sexual release. She was floating away on a sea of bliss,
blackness was threatening to enfold her but she still held onto him, could
still feel his thrusts inside her. She felt him explode, felt him tense and
heard his groans as he came startling quick deep in her pussy, she held onto
him tighter, encouraging him to fill her deeper.

&nbsp;

She felt him pulling away from her and fought to keep him
with her.

&nbsp;

�No, you have had enough, you must rest now� 

&nbsp;

She could hear the words but they seemed to be coming from a
long way off, sleep was threatening to take her and she felt herself
surrendering to its quiet lull.

&nbsp;

�You are mine!� It wasn�t a question but a statement.

&nbsp;

�Yes�

&nbsp;

He traced the outline of her face gently with his
fingertips, looking down at her.

&nbsp;

�Sleep now�

&nbsp;

She slept curled around his body, her hand in his and a
smile on her face, safe in the knowledge that she was his and always would be.
