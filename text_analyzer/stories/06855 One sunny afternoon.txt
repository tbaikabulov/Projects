Synopsis: He was having a terribly boring day...






Hunching over their slim coffee table he sighed softly and ran a hand through his high ponytail before tossing his pen aside and leaning back against the couch.&nbsp; His blackberry, tossed nonchalantly against his binder had started to buzz again and with a frustrated growl he eyed the contraption before glancing back to the muted T.V, fully considering introducing the heinous device to the toilet�

She knew he&#8217;d read the text she just sent. She also knew that given him, he&#8217;d be in the middle of something and thoroughly annoyed at the interruption. Grinning to herself she sent a clarification text as well, in case he thought to get away with anything, as he so often did. Getting in the car she hummed along to the radio almost the whole way home. She knew he could hear the car pull up in the drive and took her time getting her things gathered; knowing the extra seconds would drive him crazy.

Grumbling darkly, he finally picked up the blackberry and eyed the text message.&nbsp; Why did he give her his work number?&nbsp; Reading it made him smile, and thank the gods that he was only one with the access to his message history.&nbsp; Deleting it, and the message that followed, he neatly stacked his papers and turned off the T.V. before moving back into their bedroom, where he slowly began to get ready.&nbsp; Stripping out of the loose jeans he so loved, and tossing the worn tank top to the side.&nbsp; 
Rushing quickly he slid into a pair of white, semi translucent pants and rushed to meet her at the door, but she never came�where was she?&nbsp; Grumbling he settled into a kneeling position, knowing just what she was doing�

Taking her time walking to the door she listened to the sound of her footsteps crunch on the gravel. Stopping for a moment to look at their house, and remember everything she had inside, she smiled. Balancing her packages and bag in one hand she pushed open the door with the other, smile widening at the sight of her pet waiting for her. Kicking the door closed with her foot she left him where he was for now, dropping a kiss on his forehead as she made her way to the bedroom to put down her parcels. 

 He watched her, arching up to meet the kiss without saying anything, however when she left him sitting at the door he waited for a moment, before whining softly, calling for her attention.&nbsp; When no answer came, he squirmed then slowly stood and crossed their small house, only to kneel down once more in their bedroom&#8217;s door way, watching her with a pair of cool eyes, hidden behind his dark glasses.&nbsp; Again he whined, vying for some sort of attention.&nbsp; He hadn&#8217;t seen her in almost eight hours after all�

Setting her things on the bed she tried not to chuckle when he came and knelt by the doorway. She hadn&#8217;t told him to move, and he knew it, but she&#8217;d get to that later. Telling him to stand she had him strip out of his pants for now, measuring lengths of a new spool of raw silk ribbon against his thighs and above his knees before indicating for him to get dressed again. Having him retake his place by the door she put various things away until all that was left was a larger box, sitting in the middle of the bed.

He didn&#8217;t protest as she stripped him down, or when she measured the ribbons against his body, however he did whine when she told him to get back into his jeans and tank top.&nbsp; Settling into the worn clothing he watched her quietly, taking in every moment, every breath.&nbsp; Only to realize she had left something sitting on the bed.&nbsp; Arching his neck he tried to get a look at it, searching for some sort of label, or sign, but finding none.&nbsp; Damn her, she knew his buttons.&nbsp; Every single one of them, and she knew them well. 

Changing out of her work clothes and into a comfortable skirt and wrap around shirt she shooed him out into the kitchen, asking without asking for a cup of coffee. Picking up the box she took it to the lounge room, noticing the work papers. Setting them down away from the coffee table she took the cup he offered, taking a sip before setting it down beside the box. Opening the lid but keeping the tissue paper covering it she watched his eyes flick between her and the box, then flick back.

Making her a cup of coffee from the always warm pot, he stopped and refilled his own mug before joining her in the lounge, seeing his work papers moved he whined softly, but settled when he saw the opened box.&nbsp; Smiling softly he looked to her, and wiggled slightly.&nbsp; Asking without asking to be shown what was inside, before taking his place next to her knee.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t speak, or ask about her day, that would come later, when they lay in a tangle of dark sheets with their hair fanned out between them.&nbsp; Right now however?&nbsp; It looked like an introduction to play time�

Untying one of the lengths of ribbon she had cut from where she&#8217;d kept it around her wrist she set his coffee cup on the table as well, removing his glasses before tying the ribbon around his eyes, the thickness of it making it impossible to see around. Satisfied it was tied correctly she pulled his t-shirt off over his head, grateful for their lack of high difference. Leaving the jeans as they were she went back to the box, pulling off the tissue paper and knowing he would hear each sound distinctly, including the faint jingling. 

Smiling at the ribbon he arched his neck, only to find her removing his glasses and tying the ribbon around his eyes.&nbsp; As always, he stiffened gently, digging his powerful fingers into her leg for just a moment before relenting, submitting to her will.&nbsp; As she let go, his familiar fingers reached upwards, latching into her waistband, using that for some small support in his dark world.&nbsp; However, at the sound of the bells he smiled and looked towards her, his past momentarily forgotten in the joy of the present.&nbsp; �Bells?� He asked softly before letting his fingers slide free. �Thank you my love.�&nbsp; How he loved her bells.&nbsp; They made him feel special; each jingle reminded him of her bond, her power.

She let the small chuckle slide past her lips, pressing a kiss to his forehead and pulling the present entirely out of the box. �Not exactly, pet� She said, sliding her palms over the leather and metal in her hands. As with all of his gifts she tried to do something to make it unique, make it theirs &#8211; and this was most definitely a present for the both of them. Guiding his hands into the sleeves she walked around him, her fingers never losing touch with his skin, even as she tightened the buckles behind him. Wrapping his arms tightly she tightened them as well before tapping each of the small sterling silver bells that decorated the jacket.

He frowned for a moment. �What is it?�&nbsp; Wishing he could see, he reached out, only to have his arms guided into the smooth leather sleeves.&nbsp; �Oh.�&nbsp; There weren&#8217;t words for what he felt, rather he simply bit his lip and strained against the jacket, struggling gently against her touch, simply to feel the leather, to hear the bells. �I love it.� He whispered before trying to find her with a kiss.&nbsp; They had talked long about getting him a jacket, and he had dismissed it into the realm of fantasy, but here it was, jingling, just as she promised.&nbsp; �Thank you Owner, thank you��

The gratitude in his voice more than made up for the hell she&#8217;d had trying to find someone to properly fasten the bells to the leather. Cupping his jaw for a soft kiss she whispered �stay� against his lips before moving into the bedroom, grabbing one of the many boxes. She knew he could recognise the sound of the leash the second it snaked from the box. Clipping it to the collar he had worn all day, since he hadn&#8217;t needed to leave the house, she smiled as she watched his shoulders relax, suddenly seeming to fit more comfortably in his skin. 

Had he known, he&#8217;d have offered her a few of his contacts back in the states, but then again, that would have ruined his surprise.&nbsp; Kissing her gently he struggled inside of his new sleeves, making the bells jingle softly.&nbsp; �Yes my owner.�&nbsp; He whispered before sinking back to his knees, waiting for her.&nbsp; Hearing the twinkle of the leash his heart leapt and a tremor ran through his body.&nbsp; It was strange that that slim length of chain did to his insides, but he had long ago learned not to fight it.&nbsp; Rather he straightened his back and smiled at her, settling only when he felt the gentle tug on the leather band worn about his neck.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m on call.�&nbsp; He had to add, inwardly loving his ability to throw a monkey wrench into her plan of action.

Biting the inside of her lip to stifle the dozen or so curses that flew into her head she didn&#8217;t give him the satisfaction of saying a single one of them, knowing it would have had him giggling, though he would say chuckling, in two seconds flat. Tugging the leash enough to have him up and moving she guided him through the house with minimal assistance, knowing that he knew where everything placed was for exactly this reason. 

Laughing gently at the look on her face he couldn&#8217;t see, but knew was there he smoothly rose to his feet and followed her with ease, keeping the slack just right, even without being able to see her with his eyes.&nbsp; They had practiced often, in the light, and in the dark.&nbsp; This house was their castle; every room had felt their combined touch.&nbsp; Though, today he bumped into an end table, cursing horribly with his navy tongue as he did so.&nbsp; �The bells� He grumbled. �Distracted me�� And it was true; he had begun to listen for their soft tinkle, and forgotten where they were.&nbsp; Silly boy.

She didn&#8217;t bother to disguise the soft laugh. She knew he wasn&#8217;t hurt, and it was a fitting payback for him spoiling all his fun. Bloody bratling was too enamoured with his work. Not that she minded in the least, he loved it... most of the time. Shortening the leash and guiding him a little more than normally necessary she purposely brushed against the bells, watching his face smooth out slightly every time they chimed. Leading him out the back she smiled proudly at the garden. Neither of them were remarkably good gardeners, the area rather simplistic in design, but she still adored it. 

Smiling at the laugh he leaned forwards and tried to take a bite out of her shoulder, only to stumble again and laugh softly at himself.&nbsp; Tossing his head from side to side he smiled as she shortened his leash to give him an unneeded hand.&nbsp; With each twinkle he felt his heart grow lighter, and after the careful step out onto their patio he came to a halt, digging his bare feet into the smooth stones that he had hauled (and ended up in a sling, again) from the back of the car into their fenced backyard.&nbsp; Truly in his mind it was worth the pain.&nbsp; The subtle change had made all the difference, this yard, like their home was a castle.&nbsp; Their own little slice of heaven.

She watched as he settled further into his skin, smiling at the changes the little things produced in him. She had picked up the shortened, modified lunge whip on the way to the backyard and now set him in the middle of the grass. The whip itself was designed as a teaching tool, leaving nothing more than a vague sting. Watching the way his walk instantly changed for her she had to smile once again. The laugh that bubbled forth when she caught him changing back to his familiar stride was kind; she knew he was distracted by the constant chime of her bells. 

Stepping out into the grass he hesitated, his fear of snakes taking over, if only until a sharp tug sent him further into the well tended lawn (how he hated mowing�).&nbsp; Shivering in his coat, he waited for the soft tap of the whip as she gave the leash slack, the long, six foot chain, tugging heavily on his collar. Then, with a tap from the whip he started walking for her, moving fluidly, rolling his hips, rather than his usual, ground pounding heel to toe that he had picked up in the service. Of course, those bells were more than subtle distractions, and often he felt the sting of her whip across his shoulders and rump, reminding him of his foot work, gently showing him the way to make her heart proud.

It didn&#8217;t take him long to fall back into the rhythm of the step. Each time they worked together like this the stumbling and corrections were less. Of course, today, she noticed an increase, but she could hardly say it was without reason. Pushing him further than usual she left him at a fast walk as opposed to the normal slow glide, knowing that she would hear the faster step in the bells, as would he. 

His constant mistakes were enough to make his growl and begin cursing like the sailor he used to be, however as she urged him to greater speeds he found himself paying more attention to the feet that he couldn&#8217;t see, rather than the whip on his rump.&nbsp; The bells were all but lost to him as he began to pant and sweat in the evening sun.&nbsp; His heavy leather coat being as wonderful as it was, wasn&#8217;t made for strenuous exercise like this and it didn&#8217;t take him long to become winded; however he didn&#8217;t stop.&nbsp; Rather he simply lowered his head and trotted on, thinking of only pleasing her with his performance.&nbsp; Desiring only to meet the gift of her jacket, with the gift of his perfect submission.

Tapping the back of his neck she smiled when his chin immediately came up again. Slowing him to a walk again she watched his skin shine slightly with a fine layer sweat, leaving him in the glide that was coming so easy to him now she smiled broadly. Giving him a soft word of encouragement she smiled again as his back straightened just that little bit further, the glide almost completely fluid. She lost track of time for what felt like years but was actually only minutes, watching him, his entire body moving at her touch alone. 

Trembling he smiled softly and turned his blind eyes to watch her as he continued to glide in his circle, tramping down a soft layer of grass before whining softly. �Water would be lovely dear.�&nbsp; They hadn&#8217;t been outside long, but his pale, North Eastern body had never adjusted well to the Australian heat.&nbsp; However, complaining as he was, he never stopped or slowed his glide.&nbsp; Rather he pushed harder, fighting against his fatigue with the dogged attitude that had become his trademark.&nbsp; He would stop when he fell over, or when she told him to, and not before.&nbsp; He had to be perfect.

Tightening his circle until he came to a stop in front of her she reached out to touch a sweat-slicked cheek, smiling broadly. He was breathing heavily and his mouth was slightly slack as he sucked in a breath. Taking the moment she pulled his head forward, pressing proud lips against his own and flicking a tongue out to trail along his lip. �My perfect pet,� she whispered against his mouth before leading him inside, pulling a bottle of water from the fridge when they got to the kitchen and untying his blindfold slowly. Not taking him out of the jacket she held the bottle to his lips, smiling at the motion that seemed to natural now.

He slowed as the circles came shorter and shorter, and when he finally reached her, he returned the kiss hard, taking her lip in his mouth and biting down on it, letting her fully know that he was more than ready to go on, even if it seemed like she was going to kill him.&nbsp; Her words however, made him settle and with a soft twinkle of bells he moved along with her, into their house.&nbsp; The removal of his blindfold was met with his usual cries, and soon enough his eyes were squeeze shut to protect them from the brightness of the sun pouring in through their windows.&nbsp; 
�My glasses.� He whispered before taking the offered bottle between his lips and swallowing easily, using another skill that the pair had worked on until it became a reflex.&nbsp; He honestly couldn&#8217;t remember drinking from a water bottle on his own since before he had arrived�

Leaving him standing in the kitchen for a moment she retrieved his glasses, sliding them on his face with ease. Leading him to the couch she slowly went about unbuckling him from his jacket. Once the now warm leather had slid from his shoulders she placed it over the box, settling him at her feet for the time being and tipping the water bottle to his lips again. Soon enough they would get up and shower, start the routine for dinner, but for now she enjoyed having him here at her feet, ignoring any demand reality tried to place on her.

Opening his eyes as she placed the darkened lenses over them he smiled softly and leaned in to kiss her chin softly, before following her into the lounge.&nbsp; �Thank you.� He whispered as she removed the jacket.&nbsp; Settling against her legs, he let some of the water drip down his skin, and make a small mess on the carpet, but it was alright, it was just water.&nbsp; Yawning softly he leaned against her knee and smiled, only to have that blackberry start buzzing again�
