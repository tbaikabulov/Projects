[Author's note: The following is an adaptation and extension of a scene from
  John Norman's &quot;Slave G irl of G or&quot; published by Daw Books, 1977.
  I highly recommend the entire � G or� series for any interested in sci-fi or
  the RPP genre though most of the content is tame compared to the G host. M
  y story goes where even Tarl Cabot feared to tread...]. 
&nbsp; 
I stood in the field loosening the soil with the hoe. It was hot work, and
  I was a delicate girl. M y soft f ra me was hardly suited for this backbreaking
  work. As I worked, I thought of the first boy on Earth who had touched me,
  his trembling hand, and the hurt and embar ra ssed look on his face when I
  turned away as he tried to kiss me. Since being brought in chains to G or,
  the Counter-Earth on the exact opposite side of our sun, I had learned that
  not all men tremble in fear at the thought of kissing a woman. Some men relish
  the thought of kissing a woman, especially if the woman is a beautiful helpless
  slave girl, t ra ined like an animal to please his every need. M any men from
  Earth would consider freeing a slave ra ther than using her body for his pleasure.
  The G orean's have a saying: �Only a fool frees a slave girl.� G orean men
  are exposed to sex at an early age. �If she pleases you, run her down� is an
  often heard piece of fatherly advice given to teenage sons in G orean cities.
  Does a slave not expect slave ra pe on occasion. G oreans do not choose to
  suppress the natu ra l urges of men. Sex between state slaves owned by the
  various city states spread through ought the planet and boys' visiting the
  city is very common. It is one of the entertainments provided by most cities
  and it is the G orean way of taming the otherwise unruly natures of boys at
  any age. Even in the country, where I was now, more than 60 miles from the
  great city of Ar , there were services available at the village tavern just
  five miles away. The owner had two girls, one her master bought from a paga
  tavern in Thentis. Now the lucky girl serviced dozens of men and peasant boys
  for a very modest price. 
G or is a dangerous world for women but it is not barbaric, most of the women
  used in paga taverns or as prostitutes enjoy their work. M ost paga tavern
  girls only last for a few years because as soon as they begin to lose their
  heat, they are beaten and , if they fail to improve, sold to a private master.
  M ost women are slaves owned by Private masters ra ther than tavern or state
  slaves. Since it is technically illegal to use a Private slave without her
  master's permission slaves with private masters often fare better. A challenge
  and duel to the death is not unheard of in cases where a slave was used without
  his master's permission. However, despite the legal and societal prohibitions
  against taking the property of other men, ra pes are somewhat common. Usually
  they are overlooked as long as the slave is only ra ped and not injured and
  any torn or damaged clothing is replaced at cost. On balance it is a reasonable
  system and order is readily maintained without the neuroses caused by the Earth
  system of suppressing the natu ra l male drive. G orean's choose to exercise
  their manhood. 
Sweat poured down my face and my back ached as I worked the hoe into the ground,
  over and over again. I was, by Earth standards, a very beautiful woman. I stood
  5 foot 2 inches tall and weighed just under 110 pounds. On Earth I had kept
  my hair short but G orean masters prefer long hair in a slave girl. M y long
  blond hair reached down almost to the small of my back. I had ample breasts
  and many masters have complimented me on my figure. I should have been a pleasure
  slave working in the towers of Ar, not breaking the hard dirt of a peasant's
  field but it was completely my fault. M y M aster had been a great warrior,
  a Captain in the army of Ar, but I had tried to bend him to my will. As punishment,
  he had given me to the peasant Thentis to seal a t ra de agreement. 
Thentis owned 3 farms totaling more than 150 acres of fertile land. He also
  already owned 4 female slaves and 4 male slaves. He had a wife- a large, cruel
  free woman. He had little use for me but he understood why my former master
  had given me away. Accordingly I was put to work in the fields. I worked the
  dirt from dawn to dusk, pounding on it with the Hoe. I wore a small kerchief
  that covered my head and protected my face from the sun and a Ta Tee ra . The
  Ta Tee ra is a simple, sleeveless garment that comes above the knees and is
  tied around the waist with a strip of binding fiber. Slaves were not permitted
  nether garments. They must be available for the use of the masters in a moments
  notice. 
Thentis had only used me a few times and had commented that he was not pleased
  because my delicate body was unable to take his pounding. Thentis was a very
  large man, in all ways and I was sure he would split me open. Later I was able
  to please him with my mouth so he was mollified and agreed that he would not
  beat me because there was nothing I could do about accommodating an organ his
  size. Thentis was a leader in the small village of Tabak 's Ford, but he had
  enemies. 
Suddenly I st ra ightened myself. �B ra n Loort!� I cried. 
He stood a few feet from me, a coil of rope in his hand. M y hands clutched
  the handle of the hoe. 
He looked at me, his face growing amused. 
I flung it down. A girl dares not ra ise a weapon against a free man. Some
  girls have been tortured or had their hands cut off for so much as touching
  a weapon. 
�I have come to fetch you Dina,� he said. 
I looked about and saw them approaching boldly from the front of the field,
  3 b ra wny boys. They were carrying something in their hands. I turned to the
  right and saw 4 more boys approaching quickly. I spun and ra n but there were
  more of them coming from the left. In a panic, I started to scream hysterically
  and run towards my master's house, screaming for help, calling on him to save
  me. 
But my master was not able to save me that day. One of the boys threw a weighted
  rope at me and I fell, rolling in the dirt. They were on me in an instant.
  Eleven village boys in all surrounded me, leered at me. The remaining coils
  of rope dangled, whiplike, from the hands of Loort and another of his cohorts.
  The boys pulled me to my feet. 
�She is the clever girl who eluded us in the game of girl catch in the village,� said
  one of the lads. 
� G reetings, clever girl,� said another. 
� G reetings, M aster,� I said to him. 
I extended my wrists crossed for binding to Loort. 
�You are going to take me to me master,� I said. 
He laughed. 
I drew back my wrists and looked about, fearfully. The boys approached more
  closely about me. 
I spun, and attempted to run, but fled into the arms of one of the other young
  males. He seized me by the chin and stuck his tongue into my mouth before I
  could do anything. It was not even like a kiss, more like a cruel violation.
  Then he threw me into the center of the circle. I tried again to break the
  circle and was again rudely g ra bbed and viciously fondled before being flung
  back to the center. They were now close about me. 
I extended my wrists to B ra n Loort, crossed. �Bind me,� I said,�and take
  me to my master.� 
I saw the boys smiling. 
Trembling, I sh ra nk back, almost into the arms of the other young cohorts. 
I looked pleadingly at my captor. �Are you going to ra pe me, Loort,� I asked,
  begging him with my eyes, my lips quivering. 
�And more,� he smiled. 
Then, after a long pause while he examined my body through the Ta Tee ra he
  smiled again. 
�Tonight you will be a feast and a festival to us.� 
I trembled. 
�Hold her� he said. 
Two of the boys g ra bbed my arms. 
�Ankle leash her, both ankles,� he said. This was done and I stood still while
  four of them tied ropes around my ankles. 
�Put your arms out at the sides.� 
I did so and then stood before them, double wrist leashed, ropes knotted on
  my wrists 
All of my limbs were double leashed, held by ropes in the hands of two different
  boys. 
B ra n Loort looked at me. I knew I must please him. I glanced around at the
  other boys leering at me. Their eyes terrified me. I had seen men blind with
  lust before but this was different. They wanted to hurt me. 
�Are you docile and coope ra tive?� 
�Yes M aster,� I whispered. 
�Strip.� 
I reached for the bottom of the Ta Tee ra , preparing to slide it up over
  my body. I hoped they would soon be done with me. Suddenly the rope on my wrist
  went taught. I could not reach the coarse wool. 
�Strip�, said Loort. He swung the coils of rope, whiplike around in a circle.
  I tried to reach for the bottom of my garment with both hands and they were
  stopped, inches away by the ropes on my arms. 
Loort looked at me. �You are a rebellious slave.� 
�No, no� I cried. Wildly I tried to reach the top of the Ta Tee ra , that
  I might rip it down and expose my breasts to him. 
�Rebellious slave.� Loort swung the coils of rope overhand and struck me on
  the bare shoulder. At the same time, another boy behind me struck across the
  backs of my bare thighs. By means of the ropes on my arms and legs I was taken
  down hard to the soft dirt. M y arms and legs were spread eagled on the ground
  and I struggled and screamed as Loort and the other boy hit me again and again
  with the ropes. M any of the lashes left welts on my body even through the
  thin Ta Tee ra . After a time my struggles lessened and I started to howl in
  pain, my tears turning the dirt into mud. Rudely, I was d ra gged to my knees
  in front of Loort. 
He g ra bbed me hard by the hair and looked into my eyes. There was dirt on
  the side of my face �We will show you what happens to a rebellious slave. Bring
  her.� 
M any are the cruel tricks that can be played on a slave who was, as I was,
  double wrist and ankle leashed. Sometimes they threw me forward or backwards.
  Sometimes they carried me between them. They made me fall as they wished even
  though it might be into a tree or on rocky ground. They made me walk across
  sharp rocks and g ra vel at the edge of the lake until my feet were so bloody
  I was sure they were permanently scarred. Whenever I would balk at walking
  on the stones or c ra wling across the rocky ground I would be encou ra ged
  forward by a stocky blonde boy carrying a thick paddle. He struck me repeatedly
  throughought the cruel march, my burning bottom causing me to stumble. Once
  the cruel boys bent me over a fallen tree and he hit me as hard as he could
  until I howled. After he had hit me with at least 7 hard wacks with the paddle,
  I was sure that my bottom was bleeding. I looked behind me and touched the
  cheeks of my butt, looking for sings of blood. I could only feel and see that
  my butt was a dark purple color. The skin was hot and th rob bed mercilessly.
  Still the march continued. I had taken at least 10 bruising smacks with the
  heavy wood paddle and had been hit dozens of times by the stinging ropes. I
  did not know if I could live through the march. 
Finally we stopped near a thicket bush surrounding a clearing by the stream.
  The bushes in the thicket were very thorny, some were seve ra l inches long.
  I looked at Loor pleadingly. 
�You are still clothed� he observed. 
�Let me tear off my clothes and bare the body of a slave girl for your pleasure� I
  cried. 
�Strip�, he said. I cried in misery as the ropes prevented me, once again,
  from reaching the garment. 
�You have apparently not learned your lesson. Let the thorn bush strip her,� he
  said. 
By the ropes I was d ra gged into the middle of the thicket. Rudely I was
  d ra wn through it. The thorns ripped at my body, I screamed for mercy. I was
  shown none. I closed my eyes so I would not be blinded. When she was d ra wn
  from the thicket, her body a welter of gashes and linear wounds, the Earth
  girl slave was naked. 
Then I was forced to kneel and my arms were w ra pped around a tree. The boys,
  striking many times, put me well under rope discipline. As I kneeled there,
  shuddering under the cruel blows of the rope, my face against the bark of the
  tree, weeping hysterically, I could not believe they could be so cruel to me. 
Then they turned me over. M y legs, by means of the ropes were pulled widely,
  painfully apart. 
I realized then that I had bested these boys in the game of girl catch last
  week. I did not now feel clever. I would now pay for my cleverness. 
I cried out as the leader was the first to have me. He was not gentle, but
  was harsh and cruel. The beatings I had been given and the harsh treatment
  which I was subjected had left me dry and tight and hardly prepared for this
  onslaught against my most delicate and sensitive parts. With a grunt, Loort
  tried to enter me all at once and I cried out in indescribable agony. The pain
  was far worse than the beatings the boys had inflicted on me. It felt as if
  Loort was burning me with a b ra nding iron between my legs the pain was so
  bad. 
M y ra pist reared back on his knees pulled out and then, while holding my
  chin in place with his left hand, slapped me hard on the side of the face,
  leaving a bruise on my right cheek. &quot;You can be beaten for insufficient
  heat, slave,&quot; he said. Then he spit on his hands and used this to lubricate
  himself. He grinned down at me and then motioned for the boys holding my ankles
  to spread them even wider apart. The burning between my legs expanded to a
  hot, agonizing pain on the insides of my legs as the muscles were stretched
  taught. The boys, using the rough ropes tied to my feet pulled my ankles even
  more widely apart and d ra gged my legs up so they were very far apart and
  my back was painfully bent. I was then lying on just the upper part of my back,
  which was bent almost double. M y arms, ropes on them, were held by two boys
  stretched painfully tight at right angles to my body. M y ankles were very
  near pa ra llel with my head and my pelvis pointed st ra ight up into the air. 
Loort grinned down at me as he rubbed himself and then, using his shoulders,
  pushed my legs even more widely apart making me cry out in pain as the burning
  on the inside of my legs became unbea ra ble. I feared the muscles would snap
  they were stretched so tightly. Then, cruelly, with no preliminaries, he entered
  me all at once and I felt a terrible, sharp pain deep inside my body as he
  slammed into my cervix. Loort was big enough to hurt me if he wanted to and,
  held in this position by the boys, I was fully opened to him, totally unable
  to get any leve ra ge to tilt my hips and control the depth, if even a tiny
  bit. This let him hurt me as much as he pleased. Each merciless thrust increased
  the pain and tears ra n down my face. There was nowhere to go, I could barely
  move. The boys even held down my arms with the ropes so I could do absolutely
  nothing to cushion the relentless pounding that caused a terrible sharp pain
  deep inside my body with each hard thrust. I did not know if I could stand
  the pain, which was far worse than anything, I had ever felt. Loort may as
  well have been stabbing me, repeatedly, with a hot knife, over and over. 
Then, p rob ably as a joke, Loort lifted my face almost gently with his hands
  and whispered in my ear. &quot;Kiss me slave.&quot; I felt his mouth covering
  mine, forcing my lips open and filling my mouth with his tongue. I squirmed
  and struggled but it was useless. I was a slave and would feel exactly what
  the master wanted me to feel. M y master for the moment wanted me to feel his
  tongue in my mouth as he violated me, as he ra mmed me full of sharp, agonizing
  pain, over and over again. I whimpered into his open mouth, in pain and humiliation
  and, thankfully, my struggles and cries of pain seemed to excite him even more
  because in a moment he was spent. 

The next boy who ra ped me was much more gentle or, I fear, I would have died
  under the eleven boys, who, one after another, ra ped me as I lay, tied by
  ropes on my ankles, held in the hands of two boys. 
The third boy entered me deeply and then pulled me on top of him. I sat astride,
  grinding my hips into his, taking the hard organ into me, and working every
  muscle in my body to please him. He was very handsome and I began to heat up
  as he ordered me to move my body to please him. Then he pulled me down fully
  onto his body and whispered in my ear for me to kiss him. I put my lips on
  his and slipped my small pink tongue into his mouth as I continued to grind
  my body against him. Suddenly the blonde boy struck a heavy blow onto my bruised
  buttocks with the paddle. I screamed in agony, as the pain made my body convulse.
  The boy beneath me seemed to take immense pleasure as I screamed into his open
  mouth and spasmed uncontrollably around him. It only took 2 more heavy blows
  of the paddle before the boy beneath me started to spasm. 
The fourth boy signaled for the others to turn me over. By the ropes, I was
  flipped over and my ankles were once again pulled apart. He entered me quickly
  and the ra pe was over in just a few seconds. 
After that, the horrible burning pain from the mass ra pe stopped causing
  undue pain. I think my body had become numb. I could no longer cry. I just
  laid there, a helpless vessel as one after another boy used my body for his
  pleasure. 
One of the boys became angry at my air of indifference. He cuffed me until
  I responded and then had me ra ise my legs in the air. He seemed to take special
  pleasure in making me cry out each time he would thrust deep into my body.
  He took a long time with me, pulling out slowly and then, with a hard and violent
  thrust, would jam himself into me, hitting the sensitive tissue at the very
  bottom and making me cry out in pain. By the time he had finished with me,
  I was sobbing hysterically. On the whole, however, most of the boys did not
  seem particularly interested in making me cry out in pain. 
When they had all had their sport with me, I thought it was over, but little
  did I know that the cruel boys had other plans. The boys who had been taking
  turns holding my ankles and arms apart released them and Loort ordered me to
  go to the stream and clean myself. I could not stand, and could barely even
  c ra wl as I followed his orders and d ra gged myself to the stream. The boys
  leered at me as I, trembling, washed my stinking body and scrubbed off the
  dirt and blood. I looked at the boys watching me and knew that they had not
  yet finished with me. I only hoped I would be strong enough to take further
  punishment that they might choose to inflict on me, but looked in there eyes
  and knew instantly that they would not show me mercy. 
Loort lay down in the g ra ss on his back and motioned me, naked, to come
  to him. &quot;Please me,&quot; he grinned, pointing at himself. I c ra wled
  to him, head down, on my hands and knees, tears running down my cheeks, I choked
  back the sobs and began my task. Loort g ra bbed the back of my head by the
  hair and forced himself into my mouth, causing me to gag and almost choking
  me. M y head felt light and I was dizzy. I tried to relax, reminding myself
  that I had done this for other men on hundreds, if not thousands, of occasions
  and tried to concent ra te on completing my task. I ra n my tongue over and
  over him and used my hands to help with the job. 
It would not have been so bad if the boy who had been so cruel to me during
  the ra pe had not become impatient. He approached me from behind, rubbing my
  flanks and poking the numerous welts running down my backside. I had, of course,
  served men like this many times before and realized that this might help me
  satisfy all the boys with my limited supply of energy. The boy behind me ra
  mmed himself hard into my body, rekindling the sharp pains that had subsided
  into a dull th rob throughout my lower body. Then I felt him pull out and his
  hand came down on my back, holding me in place. At the same time, Loort g ra
  bbed my hair with both hands. Despite the terrible pain in my head as Loort
  ripped out chunks of my hair, I pulled my mouth up and cried out: &quot;Please
  no master, not like that, I'm not ready, please stop. Please stop.&quot; M
  y cries were to no avail and he kept up the relentless pressing, forcing himself
  into a new, tighter, place. I choked back sobs of pain and humiliation as my
  body stretched to receive him. Loort was kind enough to allow me to let out
  a long groan of pain before pulling my head down onto him again. 
The boy behind me was not so kind. &quot;Keep your head down, slave.&quot; I
  heard from behind me followed by a sharp slap against my bottom and a particularly
  hard thrust into me. I could not help but cry out; the pain was so sharp and
  deep.. I was sure that something had torn inside my body. This time Loort had
  a better grip on more of my hair and when I screamed and pulled away he thrust
  deep into my throat I gagged uncontrollably and could not breathe. 
The boys continued like this for what seemed like an eternity, but was p rob
  ably only a couple of minutes before I felt the boy behind me pull out. Loort
  lifted up my head and quickly stood up. I watched as he circled around me as
  the other boy sat down on the ground in front of me. He was dirty, with my
  blood on him, but I was a slave. &quot;Yes master,&quot; I said. 
While at least one boy pleasured himself from behind me, I pleasured each
  of the eleven boys for a second time, the aching in my jaws was almost unbea
  ra ble. Often they would make me stop as I pleased them so as to make it last
  longer. Some of the boys held my hands so I could only touch them with my lips,
  laughing at my despe ra te attempts to reach for them. Often during the ordeal
  I thought I would choke to death. 
Seve ra l of the boys, one at a time, ra ped me for a third time, each using
  me for some time before releasing me. 

I then lay on the ground, naked, filthy, in terrible pain throughout my body
  and wondered how they could be so cruel to me. Then one of the boys, using
  the ropes that were still on my wrists, tied my hands tightly in front of my
  body and d ra gged me, staggering, scarcely able to stand to the foot of a
  tall tree. I fell down as soon as the boy released me. Then he threw the long
  end of the rope over a low lying b ra nch and jerked the free end. I was rudely
  d ra gged to my feet, then, painfully, to the tips of my toes and finally,
  I was jerked into the air and swung in a circle with my toes just inches from
  the forest floor. 
From behind me I hear the voice of Loort. &quot;Although you were pleasing
  tonight, slave, you were not pleasing before, and must still be punished.&quot; 
&quot;Please master,&quot; I cried, &quot; I have been punished, please don't
  hurt me any more.&quot; M y squirming caused me to twist and swing enough to
  see behind me. I felt a terrible cold chill throughout my body and shuddered
  to see Loort st andi ng behind me with a heavy slave whip. The whip was black
  with five heavy studded leather belts attached to a thick staff. The studs
  were made of hard, black leather and I could instantly see that this was not
  a slave whip that is typically used on women. The usual slave whip used on
  a woman's body contains five smooth, soft leather blades. A blow from this
  whip causes excruciating pain but does not mark the woman or tear her skin.
  I knew the studs from this whip would tear at my skin and p rob ably leave
  permanent marks on my body. The whip was at least seven feet long. 
&quot;You think you were punished because you served us. Now all of us are
  going to have to beat you, slave. I told you could be beaten for insufficient
  heat.&quot; 
I screamed, but there was no sound. All of the breath went out of my body
  as a wave of pain washed over me and I almost lost consciousness. There had
  been the terrible sound of the harsh leather striking my back, and then the
  pain. 
The first lash had caught me across the lower back, in that extremely sensitive
  area, leaving five long welts running all the way across my back that mixed
  with and deepened the welts that the boys, in the rope beatings they had given
  me, had chosen to inflict on my body. The next slash hit me in almost exactly
  the same spot, and despite the ferocity of the blow, the skin of my back would
  not tear open. I could no longer cry; I suppose I was in shock by this time.
  The next blow struck at my backside. Already the boys had covered it with bright
  red welts with the harsh ropes that had repeatedly struck me and when the second
  blow from the studded whip hit my backside, I could feel a wetness start to
  trickle down my legs. I knew my butt was bleeding but the terrible, burning
  pain seemed to blot out all of my thoughts. The beating continued and the blows
  continued to fall. After the seventh blow, mercifully, I felt a blackness closing
  around me. 
But the boys did not see fit to show me mercy. I was rudely awakened with
  a bucket of cold water in my face from the stream and let out a long moan and
  started to sob as the agony screaming from every part of my body washed over
  me. I heard some of the boys laughing behind me and felt a sudden anger at
  these men who were tormenting me, who had so abused my body, who were continuing
  to torture me. But I knew that anger in a slave girl is meaningless. Without
  any warning, another blow from the harsh whip opened up my lower back and I
  cried out again and again, begging for mercy, my will completely broken. 
Each of the boys beat me with the slave whip that night and I lost consciousness
  two more times during the beating, each time to be rudely, in pain, awakened
  by chilled water thrown on me. M ost of the boys only gave me one blow, almost
  as a coup-de-g ra s that confirmed their mastery over me. 

The last boy to use the whip, however, was the one who had ra ped me so cruelly.
  He took seve ra l minutes with me and I lost count of the blows that he struck.
  He made certain to ext ra ct the maximum amount of psychological and physical
  punishment that remained before I, for a third time, was beaten unconscious.
  I would hang there, unstruck, waiting for the next blow to fall. Was the beating
  done? As soon as my head would clear and my body would relax, just a little
  bit, another blow from the heavy whip would fall. After an eternity, my head
  would not clear and I stopped reacting to the blows of the whip. I have no
  memory of being cut down from the tree.
