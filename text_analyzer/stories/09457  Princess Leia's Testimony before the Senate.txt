Testimony of Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan before the Galactic Senate

Greetings Senators of the Provisional Restored Republican Senate. I want to commend the forces of the Rebel Alliance for bringing the awful criminal Twak Namdar to justice. I myself was a victim of Namdar, during my enslavement by Jabba the Hutt. Namdar was a hired mercenary for the Hutt regime, and played a great role in my abuse and humiliation. I&#8217;m aware that there has been a great deal of rumors and gossip about my slavery to Jabba, and it has been a hot topic both in Rebel and Imperial zones of the Galaxy. Quite a bit of hologram footage of my experience in Jabba&#8217;s Palace has been circulating around the Holoweb. Most of it is fraudulent, but I regret to admit that some of it is genuine. Mara Jade, an imperial agent who was posing under the pseudonym Arica, as a dancer for Jabba, has been instrumental in obtaining and leaking the footage of my debasement. I&#8217;m also informed that there is a sleazy bar in Coruscent, which features the green military sportsbra and panties I was captured in, as well as several of the slave outfits I was forced to wear, as part of a disgusting Imperial plot to revel in my humiliation and impinge my character. 

I wish we didn&#8217;t have to talk about something like this so soon after our great victory at Endor. But it is important that the Galaxy know, that Princess Leia is not ashamed she was once a slave. And I want my testimony to help bring Namdar to justice, so that no one else ever has to suffer from his sadism. Because Tatooine is in the outer-rim, most of those who took part in my abuse, and the abuse of countless other females, will never be brought to justice. But I will personally work with the Rebel Taskforce to help stamp out slavery in the Galaxy. My grandmother, father, and mother all spent periods of their lives as slaves in Tatooine. Jabba the Hutt and his minions are the ones who should live in shame, not his victims. I&#8217;m a survivor. And I&#8217;m proud that I did what I had to do on Tatooine to survive and ultimately triumph over Jabba. I hope that when the Galaxy hears what I suffered as a slavegirl, it will not be a mark of shame for me, but a mark of courage for all those women and Twilks, who have suffered the same treatment.

So some of the rumors have claimed that I went to Jabba&#8217;s Palace as a slut, dressed in the metal bikini, with the plan of serving him as a harem slave to seduce him. This is totally a lie. If anyone wants to call me a slut, I was actually dressed in sexier lingerie when captured by Darth Vader. I had on silk imperial undergarments at that point. And yet despite the physical torture I endured on the Death Star, I never once felt that my sexual integrity as a woman was under threat. I never experienced the same sexual humiliation. The Empire&#8217;s evil has a cold rationality that is the opposite of the lusty fleshy evil of the Hutts. 

I entered Jabba&#8217;s palace disguised as a male Boush Bounty hunter. When I was forcibly stripped by Jabba&#8217;s guards. I was not wearing anything provocative underneath. In fact I was wearing green standard-issue Rebel Alliance military sports-bra and panties. Nonetheless it was incredibly humiliating to be stripped in public in front of Jabba&#8217;s retinue. He forced me to kiss him in front of everyone. I was allowed to continue to wear my underwear when I was thrown into the harem. However there was a very strict hierarchy among the harem girls. The women at the bottom, were the ones like me- with interesting stories of adventure and heroism. Some of the slave girls were former Rebels who had been captured and sold to Jabba, one of the girls had been a great smuggler and pirate with amazing stories. And it brought me to tears to see such strong, intelligent, amazing women reduced to the level of playthings and toys for a fat slug. We were at the bottom of the slave-girl pecking order. The �regular� slave girls were above us, and then the criminal element and finally the Imperial infiltrators like Mara Jade. As a former Princess and Rebel leader I was subject to degrading humiliation and abuse, not only from the guards but even from fellow slave girls. Mara Jade was particular sadistic towards me as a former Princess. She forcibly stripped me of my bra and panties. She waved them around like trophies. I was left entirely nude in the harem quarters, which was a very dangerous position to be in. Some of the slave bullies also stole my blanket and food rations. We were used for the entertainment of the guards. One of their favorite activities was forcing us slavegirls to wrestle each other in the nude. I tried to use non-violence towards my fellow slaves, but that lead to painful beatings, so I had no choice but to fight back with all my strength. I still ended up beat down. I would be lying on the floor, my whole body bruised and beaten. Desperate for some rest and peace. And Namdar and Mara Jade would come and taunt me. �We�we..we. have powerful friends, your going to regret this� they would laugh. Trying to maintain an ounce of dignity I would whisper back �nerfherder�. And they would respond with terrible abuse. Eventually they got it so that I wouldn&#8217;t fight back, and they declared me broken. In my shame and terror I really did act like Jabba&#8217;s pet. Jabba wanted me as his harem girl, so he didn&#8217;t want my beauty messed up. So I would pathetically whimper to the guards �I&#8217;m not to be harmed�. 

I knew that I wouldn&#8217;t survive under those conditions. So I had to make my deal with the Sith. I agreed to submit to Jabba. And utter all the degrading things he forced me to say. And crawl on all 4s and kneel before him. In return for my submission I received my famous �metal bikini� and was chained up in front of Jabba, most of the day so at least I was safe from the physical abuse of the guards. I tried to maintain as much class and dignity as possible under the conditions. Whenever possible I would defy Jabba&#8217;s will in small ways. Although this often lead to even more embarrassing public punishments. But I never forgot that I was a Princess of Alderan, the sister of a Jedi, and a leader of the Rebel Alliance. Of course my enemies never forgot it either. And they would constantly taunt me about my lowered condition, and force me to demean myself. One of the worst abuses is that they forced some of the captured Rebel girls to carry out my punishment. It was heartbreaking for them to hurt their own leader, who they had fought for and would die for, but they had no choice under the conditions. I would cry myself to sleep at night, sobbing in fetal position, much to the palace&#8217;s amusement. In my dreams I felt the Force connecting me with my dead mother Queen Amidala. She was there to comfort her little girl through her worst hour. I felt like I was a child in my mother&#8217;s arms. I had never felt so helpless in my life.
