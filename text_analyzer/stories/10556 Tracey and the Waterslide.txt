Tracey was nervous but also excited as she walked down the hall to Mr. Chamber&#8217;s office. It had been almost seven months since she had been hired by his prestigious advertising agency as the Director of Advertising and so far all she had been was little more than eye candy for the company&#8217;s management team. She was hoping to get a real chance work on a major advertising campaign. 
�I am here to see Mr. Chambers?� Tracey said to the secretary. 
�Yes, he is expecting you� the older receptionist said looking over her glasses. She watched Tracey walk by in her dark blue suit and she shook her head slightly from side to side.
Mr. Chambers suddenly appeared at the doorway �Please come in Tracey� he said excitably.
Tracey entered the office and sunk down in one of Mr. Chamber&#8217;s large chairs.
�Tracey I have some great news� Mr. Chambers said as he took a seat behind his desk.
�We have just signed a contract to develop an advertising campaign for Shady Sam&#8217;s Waterpark.�
�As you probably know, Shady Sam&#8217;s is not really the nicest waterpark in our area but this year they have purchased a new waterslide and they want us to help them promote it.�
�That sounds great Mr. Chambers!� Tracey said happily. �Do you want me to put some ideas together?
�Well Tracey, I already have got some pretty good ideas for this advertising campaign but I want you to be a major part of the rollout. The time has come for you to really get your feet wet!�
Tracey sat up in her chair and smiled. �Great, I am looking forward to it.�
�The entire campaign will center upon a picture and a short video that I will have produced for us in just a couple of weeks and I want you to put together a social media campaign that will really help get the word out about the new waterslide.�
�We want as many people as possible to see these promotional pieces.�
�I will do that Mr. Chambers!� Tracey replied happily.
�Excellent.&nbsp; Tomorrow I would like you to go over to Shady Sam&#8217;s office building and introduce yourself to their management team. �Toss some ideas around with them and then bring me back a full report.�
Chambers got up and moved to the door. Sensing the meeting was now coming to a close; Tracey also rose and began to leave. 
As they both reached the door Mr. Chambers said, �I think you have a very special quality that will really help make this campaign a success Tracey.� As he spoke he brought his hand up and playfully slapped Tracey&#8217;s firm and full bottom.�
Tracey jumped slightly at the playful spank. Mr. Chambers had patted her like this once before right after she had been hired and while she didn&#8217;t really like it she knew she didn&#8217;t have enough �pelts on her wall� yet to complain too loudly about the ass patting. She remained silent and just shook her head up and down in agreement.
�Now I expect you to be a team player on this. Our rollout meeting is in two short weeks� Chambers said with a serious look. �I need the social media platform ready to go.�
�You can count on me Mr. Chambers� Tracey replied as she left the office.
Mr. Chambers leaned on the door jam and watched Tracey walk down the hall in a quiet satisfaction.
Over the next two weeks Tracey went hard to work in putting together the presentation slides that she would use at the rollout meeting to explain how the company could use social media to promote the new waterslide.
Later that week while Tracey was working with Mr. Chamber&#8217;s assistant Emily when she saw the email about the rollout:
�We are doing the advertising rollout and presentation at the waterpark?� Tracey asked Emily.
Emily explained that the waterpark was still closed for the winter that they very much wanted to show off their newest slide �Sam&#8217;s Super Blaster!�
�Are the management guys going to go down the new waterslide?� Tracey asked the assistant incredulously. She knew that the management groups from both companies would be at the meeting but she had a hard time imaging that they would be going down a waterslide.
�I am not sure but Mr. Chambers wants everyone to bring a swimsuit� Emily replied.
Tracey shook her head. �Well this is the biggest meeting of my career and I am certainly not bringing a swimsuit� Tracey said resolutely.
�Suit yourself then, but I am going to do what Mr. Chamber&#8217;s asks me to do.� Emily said as she walked out of the office.
A week later it was time for the big rollout. Tracey wore her formal black suit and had put together a presentation that she was sure would earn her some points with Mr. Chambers. She even selected a suit that showed just a little bit of her cleavage. 
�Better safe than sorry� reasoned Tracey. �A little sexy never hurts.�
Tracey got to the waterpark a little bit early because she wanted to familiarize herself with the conference room and make sure they had the proper hook ups for her computer. She parked her car in the lot and began to walk to the entrance. 
�There you are!� Tracey then saw Mr. Chambers coming to greet her from across the parking lot.
�Have you talked with Emily yet? Mr. Chambers seemed a little bit worried.
�Not yet� she said.
�Well there was a screw up with staffing for the park and I are going to need you to work a little bit before the presentation.�&nbsp;&nbsp; Chambers explained.
�In order for us to use the new waterslide we need to have someone up on the platform to make sure there is no horseplay� Mr. Chambers explained. �It is the park rules.�
�You want me to go up there?�
�Yes, but just for a bit. I will send Emily up to get you in a few minutes. Right now she is setting up my computer over in the conference room.�
�But Mr. Chambers I am wearing heels?�
�Oh just leave your shoes at the bottom of the ladder� Mr. Chambers smiled. He reached out and turned Tracey&#8217;s shoulders toward the waterslide and again playfully swatted her on the bottom. �Get over there little lady.�
�You won&#8217;t be there for long� Chambers said over his shoulder as he hurried back toward the office building. �I&#8217;ve got big plans for you.�
Tracey sulked over to the slide and then looked up the long ladder. She knew that Mr. Chambers expected her to be a team player and so she began her precarious assent up the steel ladder. When she arrived at the top of the waterslide platform she noticed that she could only see out into the parking lot and down the deep throat of the impressive slide.
The slide itself was about 500 feet long and appeared to have a couple of pretty good drops. Tracey looked down the slide and wondered absently where it ended.
In the conference room Mr. Chambers began the advertising campaign rollout to the managers of both companies.
�Guys I have created a campaign that will keep the teenage boys running to your waterpark all summer long� he began.
�We are going to promote the park with an advertising campaign that focuses on your newest waterslide, Sam&#8217;s Super Blaster.�
Shady Sam looked at him blankly. 
Mr. Chambers continued. �I have designed an ad campaign around the slogan �Sam&#8217;s Super Blaster: it will scare your pants off!�&nbsp; I believe that we can increase park attendance by over 200% this year and get you millions of hits on your website�
Shady Sam looked more impressed. �Can you please be more specific?�
Over at the waterslide, Tracey could see Emily now making her way up the ladder in her bathing suit carrying a small backpack over her shoulder.
�Thank god� thought Tracey. �Who the hell would go down this horrible thing anyway?�
Emily arrived on the platform.
�Where is your bathing suit?� Emily quickly asked.
�I don&#8217;t have time for this, I have a presentation to make� Tracey said as she moved toward the ladder.
�You can&#8217;t go down the ladder Tracey, it&#8217;s the park rules. Mr. Chambers had to sign a release.�
�Well I sure as hell can&#8217;t go down this stupid thing; I am wearing a business suit!� Tracey replied.
�That is why the meeting invitation said you had to bring a bathing suit Tracey!� Emily scolded her. �Mr. Chambers was really clear that you had to bring one.�
In the conference room Mr. Chambers continued. �Today I have scheduled an ad shoot right here at the park and in just a minute I will show you the picture that will brand your waterpark as both the sexiest and the scariest waterpark in the Midwest.�
�Now last week you all had a chance to meet out new Advertising Director Tracey Smith correct?� Chambers asked as he looked around.
The men shook their heads in satisfaction. �Lovely girl� Shady Sam finally replied.
�We plan to use Tracey as a model for the waterpark; she is going to get your park a lot of attention.� 
The men looked at each other all a bit curious. They had been quite impressed with the lovely Tracey when she visited their offices last week; typically the girls that worked for Shady Sam were cut from a lower branch of the social tree than young Tracey.
Chambers continued, �As we speak Tracey Smith is standing at the top of Sam&#8217;s Super Blaster preparing to take some promotional pictures for your park. In fact, in the next few minutes Tracey will be completely naked!�
There was an audible gasp among the group. The men moved to the window to see if Tracey was visible but she was hidden from their view up on the waterslide platform.
�She has agreed to be a model for the park and do some very sexy promotional work for you.�
Mr. Chambers then went on to explain how the ad campaign would work, what pictures would be taken of Tracey and how Tracey&#8217;s images would be used.
At the top of the slide Emily pulled a plastic bag from the backpack pack she was wearing.
�It&#8217;s the only way you can get to the meeting Tracey�
�Just put all your clothes in the bag and they will stay dry when you go down the slide� Emily said to Tracey.
�All the guys are inside the conference room right now anyway so once you reach the water you can quickly go over to the restrooms and get dressed� Emily instructed. �Nobody will even see you.�
�What about my hair?� questioned Tracey.
�The slide is really slow and you will land on your feet, your hair won&#8217;t even get wet� Emily told Tracey.
Tracey again looked at the mouth of the slide with some trepidation. She could hear the roar of water running through the slide. A red light illuminated the mouth of the slide from somewhere below her field of view. The light came up through the slide quite ominously.
In the conference room Mr. Chambers looked at his phone eagerly anticipating the picture Emily was waiting to snap of Tracey. Now that all the men understood the full scope of Mr. Chamber&#8217;s advertising campaign they were all very excited to see some of the marketing material.
At the top of the slide Tracey unclasped her bra and handed the last bit of her clothing to Emily. She was now completely naked on the platform of Sam&#8217;s Super Blaster. Emily then put all of Tracey&#8217;s clothes into the plastic bag and jammed the whole thing into her backpack. 
�I will come down the slide right behind you so we can get you dressed for your big presentation� Emily told her.
As Mr. Chambers guessed, Tracey stood nude before the mouth of the large slide and looked down the throat of it for a few minutes trying to access the danger; Emily took a number of pictures of the naked girl looking down into the slide. The shot was a head to toe picture of Tracey&#8217;s naked backside staring down into the opening of the scary looking slide. She emailed the best picture to Mr. Chambers with the words, �Here is your campaign poster!�
Chambers looked at the picture he received and smiled broadly.&nbsp; �Wow, now that is one sexy backside Tracey.� He thought as he took a good look at Tracey&#8217;s naked behind. He quickly loaded the picture onto the presentation screen and placed the slogan above Tracey&#8217;s head, �Sam&#8217;s Super Blaster: it will scare your pants off!�
�Gentlemen this picture will be the center of our advertising campaign.� They all looked up at the screen and saw the picture of Tracey at the opening to the slide. �This branding of the Sam&#8217;s Super Blaster slide will make you millions. It will hit your target demographic like a hammer.� 
�You have done it again Chambers!� Shady Sam said as he rose to shake his hand. �How in the world did you get Tracey to agree to pose for that picture?�
�Let&#8217;s just say she was eager to make a big splash in the advertising business� Chambers said. All the men laughed loudly never taking their eyes off the presentation screen.
�Gentlemen let&#8217;s go outside, Tracey is now about to come down the slide. As I explained, we have a crew here to film it for your website. On the website we will post the full video of Tracey going down the Super Blaster as a means of generating increased web traffic. Tracey set up the whole thing!� again the men laughed as they hurried out to the foot of the waterslide.
At the top, Tracey sat naked on Sam&#8217;s Super Blaster and clutched the safety bars. Chambers had a video crew set up at the bottom and he had multiple cameras filming inside the slide including a hidden one at the top covertly recording Tracey&#8217;s current state of concern.
All of the print advertising showing Tracey&#8217;s naked backside looking into the red mouth of the slide would contain the tag line: �Watch Tracey&#8217;s full unedited video at SamsSuperBlaster.com.� 
Although viewers would have to confirm they were 18 in order to view the short film, Mr. Chambers knew that the video of the naked Tracey bouncing down the ridiculously fast slide and the catapulting into the water would get millions of views a month. For teenage boys it would be hypnotic jerk off material (only those over 18 of course). Shady Sam would be making money hand over fist.
At the mouth of the slide Emily gave Tracey some final encouragement:
�Come on Tracey, your presentation is about to begin! Mr. Chambers is counting on you.�
With that Tracey released her grip and very quickly disappeared down the red mouth of the slide.
�Naked girl coming your way� Emily texted Mr. Chambers and she headed back to the ladder.
Inside the tube Tracey quickly generated a tremendous speed. Her hair was very soon soaked through as she raced wet and blind through the powerful waterslide. The HD cameras dutifully recorded Tracey&#8217;s waterslide journey for all Shady Sam&#8217;s future customers.
At the bottom of the slide all the men all fished out their cell phones so they could take some pictures of Tracey when she finally hit the landing pool. The end of the slide was left about ten feet above the landing pool to maximize the �blasting� effect.
After about 30 seconds of falling, twisting and racing through the slide, Tracey literally exploded out the end of the waterslide. She summersaulted high over the water and then crashed in the landing pool at the feet of the executives with her ass half out of the water.
All the men erupted in cheers as she stood up and tried to pull the hair from her eyes. Her large breasts glistened in the bright March sunlight and the men fully enjoyed her nakedness. Tracey ended up showing the men a little more cleavage that she had originally planned as she stood up in the landing pool trying to regain her composure.
�Come on Tracey, let&#8217;s all head over to the conference room so we can hear your ideas on how to use the new social media!� Chambers laughed as he helped her out of the water.
�These kids and their social media� Chamber&#8217;s said with a chuckle.
