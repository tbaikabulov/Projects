The Psychologist
�
�I&#8217;ve put both the suiciders in the small ward on their own, Carol. Thought it might be easier for you to talk to them together if you wished.�
�
�Thanks Matron, Barbara, I&#8217;m hoping they&#8217;ll talk to each other too and work out their problems.�
�
�Not at the moment, the boy thinks the girl is a dumb klutz and the girl has problems even looking at a boy with no legs. Unusual to have two teenage suicide attempts almost at the same time and from different parts of the town and backgrounds. They&#8217;re both recovering well but the girl is badly bruised from before her attempted drowning.�
�
�Any reasons that you&#8217;ve heard mentioned?�
�
�Neither of them have said much Carol, and I haven&#8217;t pressed it because I didn&#8217;t want to interfere with your work, but the girl was afraid to go back to school. She&#8217;s had more than her fair share of the strap and they&#8217;d threatened her with the cane. Seems most of her bruises are from school punishments. The boy just seemed depressed at not being able to walk or take a girl out, or take a girl home for sex even though he should now be able to almost demand it.�
�
�Thanks Barbara, that&#8217;s more info than I have.�
�
In the ward she found the two beds separated by a curtain. Immediately she pushed it back. �Hi,� she greeted them, �I&#8217;m Dr. Carol Tinsley, a psychologist, but you can forget about the title and just call me Carol, like my friends.� Glares and silence from her patients. �Don&#8217;t I even get a &#8216;Hi&#8217; in return?� At least that resulted in a muttered response.
�
�Okay, I guess that&#8217;s a start. You are Kevin Syson and you&#8217;re seventeen years old and live with your grandparents?�
�
�And I&#8217;m legless, in case you haven&#8217;t been told.�
�
�We&#8217;ll come to that in a minute. And you are Sharon Kidman, the same age and have problems at school because you are unable to do the work.�
�
�Yes Miss.�
�
�And you both have difficulty in relating to others?� No response. �I had thought to use our time together in a group therapy situation and almost abandoned the idea when I learned you hardly spoke to each other, but I&#8217;ve decided to give it a try from a slightly different angle.� Without warning, she pulled the covering from Kevin&#8217;s bed, leaving him naked and exposed. He tried unsuccessfully to push himself up enough to grab the covering but Carol restrained him and pulled him to one side of the mattress.
�
�Sharon, get yourself out of bed and stand where we can see you.�
�
�Please Miss, don&#8217;t��
�
�Do you usually defy your teachers at school Sharon?�
�
�No Miss.�
�
�Then you&#8217;ll do what I ask you even though I&#8217;m not using the threat of the strap.� Reluctantly Sharon stood between the two beds. �Turn round please.� Shocked at the bruising that marked both her back and front, Carol exclaimed, �Take a good look at that Kevin, I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;s suffering far more than you at the moment. Is that all from school?�
�
�Almost all Miss, and I they said they would cane me in front of the whole school. I can&#8217;t help not being able to read Miss. The doctor says I have trauma dyslexia from when I came off my bike and hit my head but the teachers don&#8217;t believe it. I can&#8217;t stand any more pain Miss, I wanted to die and be rid of it all but a man grabbed me before the water swept me out into the sea.�
�
�Have the doctors here given you anything to ease your pain?�
�
�Yes, Miss.�
�
�Please call me Carol. Miss makes me feel like I am a teacher, which I&#8217;m not. I hope that I am going to be a friend even though I will ask you to do and say things you may not wish to do or say. I&#8217;m here to help you recover from the abuse of the last few weeks and to see what can be done about the dyslexia.� She turned to Kevin. �You&#8217;ve had a good look at Sharon, is there anything wrong with her body apart from the bruises?�
�
�I suppose not, apart from she&#8217;s a bit short and tubby and her hair&#8217;s a mess.� Tears started to flow down Sharon&#8217;s face.
�
�You&#8217;re so generous with your praise, Kevin. Have you had a better looking girlfriend?� Sadly he shook his head. �I wouldn&#8217;t mind betting, you&#8217;ve wished people wouldn&#8217;t judge you by your body,� Carol went on.
�
�Your turn, Sharon but before you say anything, let me pull this cover back up a little.� She pulled it until it just covered the base of his stumps but left his prick on show. �Now Sharon, is there anything wrong with the body you can see?�
�
�No Miss�Carol.�
�
�His penis looks okay to you? Not to big or too small and it seems to be in working order, doesn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s starting to get hard just because we&#8217;re looking at it.�
�
�Yes, but��
�
�From what you can see at the moment, probably the only difference to other boys of his age is the strength of his arms. He&#8217;s had to build up his muscles to lift himself around. Correct Kevin?� Kevin nodded. �Right now Sharon, you didn&#8217;t find him repulsive when you only saw the top half and as there&#8217;s no bottom half to worry about, hop into bed with him. Sharon looked ready to run but thought better of it and slowly climbed in and, at Carol&#8217;s insistence, snuggled close to him. �Put your arm around her Kevin. Pull her close to your body without hurting her bruises.� When they reluctantly complied, she went on, �I&#8217;m going to the cafeteria now for a cup of tea, and I&#8217;ll be gone for about ten minutes. While I&#8217;m away, explore each other with your hands, kiss if you feel like it, and talk if you wish, but the main thing is to feel each other as though you are lovers. When I return, we&#8217;ll find out what led to you each trying to end your lives. By then I hope you will feel comfortable enough to talk freely and help each other through this trauma.�
�
�I don&#8217;t know what she expects to happen, feeling each other isn&#8217;t going to make us like each other,� Kevin complained.
�
�Perhaps she expects us to fuck and I know you&#8217;ve a hard-on and can order me to open my legs.�
�
�Like I can fuck anything with it! A woman with no legs just has to lie there; a man with no legs can&#8217;t thrust his hips. I have to be satisfied with doing it by hand or getting a blowjob.�
�
�It can be done with the girl doing the work. I&#8217;ve done it that way a couple of times but it would hurt my muscles to do it like that at the moment.�
�
�Yeah, I tried it with a girl like that once and she lasted all of thirty seconds before collapsing and out of breath.�
�
�You&#8217;re a pessimist.�
�
�You&#8217;re a dumb bimbo.�
�
�I hate you!�
�
�Go back to your own bed then.�
�
�I would if I didn&#8217;t think that Carol might strap me, I&#8217;ve had enough of that.� Instead she turned her back to him.
�
�Oh well, I suppose it was too much to expect instant bonding,� Carol laughed when she returned, �You&#8217;ll get a lot more practice when we get you to rehab tomorrow. For the rest of today, you can stay in his bed Sharon, but you better sleep in your own tonight so that you get a good nights rest and these beds are only suitable for one person. Sit up now and face me. Kevin, put your arm around her again and then we&#8217;ll hear Sharon&#8217;s story. Carol raised the head end of the bed and rearranged the pillows for their comfort before asking, �Have your parents been in?�
�
�Grandma&#8217;s very ill and grandpa can&#8217;t leave her,� Kevin muttered.
�
�No, not yet, perhaps this evening,� Sharon answered without much hope of that being the case. �I&#8217;ll probably be in trouble if they do. No doubt security will have visited them and asked awkward questions,� she added.
�
�I&#8217;ll ask hospital security to be on hand if they come. For the time being you are under my guardianship and the doctors while you&#8217;re here. We don&#8217;t know yet if your parents are responsible for your trying to take your life so you were automatically put under the Mental Health Care Trust, that I oversee. For the time being, I am your surrogate mother.� Carol paused to let that information sink in before asking, �Sharon, will you tell us why you felt compelled to try and commit suicide? Please be frank and truthful. You know we can always put you on the TED machine, the lie detector, but I would rather not use that if we can do it in a friendly way here.�
�

Sharon&#8217;s Story
�
�I don&#8217;t know where to begin Miss�Carol.�
�
�Tell us about your family and how the new laws affected your home life.�
�
�I don&#8217;t see much of them. Mother works six evenings a week, sometimes seven if they&#8217;re short staffed, waitressing at a club. She&#8217;s left for work when I get home from school and I&#8217;m in bed when she gets in. Since men&#8217;s emancipation, she now has to work topless and she&#8217;s has to service the boss and some members in order to keep her job, so she has enough to worry about without my problems. Daddy doesn&#8217;t seem to mind and if she&#8217;s not available, he comes into my room. That&#8217;s not too often because after work he goes to a sex club for a meal and a fuck. Sundays they&#8217;re usually both home Daddy will often force Mummy or me or both of us together to service him. He&#8217;s making the most of the new rules and his authority over us.�
�
�Does he use the strap on you too?�
�
�Both of us if we don&#8217;t show willing, but not as bad as at school.�
�
�So your parents have seen the results of the strappings you&#8217;ve had at school and not done anything about them?�
�
�Mother commed the school once but was told they had to keep to the rules and if I did my homework properly and arrived at lessons on time, that wouldn&#8217;t be necessary.�
�
�The teachers didn&#8217;t believe the severe trauma dyslexia problem?�
�
�I think they liked to have a girl bare her bottom or be made to go naked, at least Mr. Eccles the English teacher, and Mr. Matthews who takes me for maths, did. They made sure I had it as hard as they dared and gave me the maximum number of strokes allowed. And when they thought my bottom and back had sufficient marks, they started on my front. I also had to visit them in their offices after school for sex and they both preferred my bottom hole causing me even more pain. They did stop before I needed hospital treatment and several times they mentioned that girl who nearly got killed at Morsham High School.�
�
�Tell me about the cause of the dyslexia please, Sharon.�
�
�There&#8217;s not much to tell. It happened in a micro-second. One moment I rode my bike fast along a clear road, and the next a dog ran into my path. I swerved, hit the kerb and went over the handlebars and landed on my head. I came to in the hospital with a huge lump on my head and afterwards I found the letters of the words and figures in maths didn&#8217;t make sense, and I could no longer look at a clock to tell the time. The doctors blamed me for not wearing a helmet and said the dyslexia would go in a day or two. It&#8217;s been three weeks now and, while one doctor talked about treatment, so far nothing has been done.�
�
�And the strappings got worse?�
�
�Yes Miss, sorry Carol. I&#8217;ve tried to do my homework but even if I can read the textbook, it is like I write in another language. A few teachers accept my problem, but Mr. Eccles and Mr. Matthews don&#8217;t, and punish me for everything. I&#8217;ve lost count of the number of times they hit me during the previous weeks but as you&#8217;ve seen, my entire body shows colourful bruises. Then last Thursday, I had eight strokes in the morning for maths and eight in the afternoon for English but I was also late because I tried to hide away from everyone and Mr. Eccles said he would have me caned in front of the whole school during assembly the next morning. They hinted that if the caning didn&#8217;t produce a result, I&#8217;d be sent to the whipping hall.�
�
�That was when you decided to end your life?�
�
�I&#8217;d thought about it a lot during the previous week because I just couldn&#8217;t stand the continuous pain. It hurt to walk, it hurt to sit and I couldn&#8217;t sleep and there didn&#8217;t seem to be an end to it. I couldn&#8217;t go on and there wasn&#8217;t anyone willing to help so I did the only thing I could think of to end the pain for good. In earlier days, before the change, I&#8217;ve stood on the bridge over the Carney and watched the water run swiftly under it and then out to sea and thought it would be the easiest place for me to end my suffering. I waited until I couldn&#8217;t see any one else in sight, sat on the parapet for a few moments, before jumping in. The cold water took me as I planned and woke me a little but I didn&#8217;t try to swim, just let the current take me to the oblivion of the sea. I wouldn&#8217;t be here now if a fisherman, hidden in the bushes by the bank, hadn&#8217;t watched me jump and waded in and grabbed my clothing on a bend where the river slowed a little. I remember pleading with him to let me go and knew little more until I came round in bed here and for the first time for weeks, felt free of pain.�
�
�That was two days ago?�
�
�Yes.�
�
�And you&#8217;re still free of pain?�
�
�Not completely because they took me off that drug but the pain is bearable and they give me something to make me sleep at night.�
�
�Did you see Kevin brought in?�
�
�Yes, sort of because I was a bit out of it with the drug. Sometime that night they brought him in and I saw his body as they lifted him into bed. His skin looked a funny colour, or so it seemed to me, and I felt sick when I saw he only had a body and no legs and turned over and looked the other way.�
�
�Are they going to do anything about the dyslexia?�
�
�I&#8217;m to see a specialist the day after tomorrow.�
�
�Good, I&#8217;ll make sure you get there. Have you any comment to make Kevin?�
�
�Not really. I didn&#8217;t know of her problem and thought her pretty dim especially when she asked the time and the clock was on the wall in front of her, but I suppose I have to accept that now. She doesn&#8217;t want to be near me though, and even after being in bed with her, I don&#8217;t think she wants to look at me.�
�
�After she&#8217;s taken over the role of a nurse and looked after you for a while, she&#8217;ll get used to it Kevin.� Both teenagers register their shocked when they&#8217;d digested the implications of Carol&#8217;s remark and protested to her but she was adamant that they would be together in a close relationship for the immediate future.
�
�
Kevin&#8217;s story
�
�Your turn now Kevin, start from the time you lost your legs. You were only a baby then I believe.�
�
�I need to piss,� Kevin stated belligerently.
�
Carol brought the container and gave it to Sharon. Her eyes opened wide in shock. �Yes, I deliberately gave it to you because while I&#8217;m in charge of you, you are each going to assist each other, even when it is not really necessary. Part of your nurse role. Push the bedcover down and insert his prick into the container. It won&#8217;t bite and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve handled a good number in the last few weeks.�
�
Pushing the cover down and having to grasp Kevin&#8217;s prick, meant his stumps were almost in her face and, although she tried to avoid it, her hand touched one. �It feels like normal skin,� she thought while waiting for him to perform. From the small amount, they all knew he didn&#8217;t really need to pee and was reluctant or ashamed to tell his story.
�
�Kevin, no more delaying please. You heard Sharon tell us clearly why she jumped into the river, now, even if you have emotional problems with your story, we need to hear them in order understand and to help you. So I&#8217;ll ask you again to tell us about the loss of your legs because that probably is the root of your problems, and how that has affected your life to the extent of wanting to end it.�
�
For a few moments Kevin closed his eyes and his face took on an expression of horror before recovering. Slowly and hesitantly he started. �In a way I blame my sister, the sister I never had. She decided to enter this world earlier that they expected and my father rushed us to hospital. Unfortunately he drove too fast in the wet weather and we never got to the hospital, at least not to the maternity department. I was only two years old at the time and all I can remember is the sudden stop, the tremendous noise and the glass flying everywhere. It still comes back to me at nights when I feel lonely.�
�
�But you found out what happened later?�
�
�Yes, Grandma kept all the cuttings and stuff and gave it to me when she thought I&#8217;d grown enough to comprehend it. Workmen had dug a trench halfway across the road up to clear a collapsed main water drain and were about to lower a thick sheet of steel over it with a crane so cars could use that side while they extended the trench across the road. Robocars were only starting to come in and we still had one of the old petrol vehicles and father was speeding in the pouring rain on a slippery road. Unfortunately, the previous car had also sped passed the site and skittled the protective cones. One workman had started to replace them when we came round the corner, face to face with the thick steel sheet. It sliced through the windscreen decapitating my parents and would have me too except the force of the impact tipped the rear of the car up and the sheet chopped my legs. One of the workmen pulled me out and wrapped me in a towel but they had to await the rescue service before they could cut my dead parents out and too late to save my sister. The air ambulance whisked me to hospital and they saved my life but when they found my legs in the wreck, they were too crushed and mutilated to sew back on. There, you can go and be sick now!�
�
The two ladies did indeed look pale upset at the gruesome tale but stayed where they were.
�
Carol quickly recovered her professionalism. �You&#8217;ve had fifteen years to get over that Kevin, so there must have been other, more recent, events that caused such deep depression in your mind.�
�
�I don&#8217;t want to talk about it.�
�
�But you will, either here or I&#8217;ll book a session on the TED machine. Your choice.�
�
�Bitch.�
�
Calmly Carol placed her fingers under his chin and lifted his head forcing him to look into her eyes. �If you ever say anything like that again, your pristine white arse will blush deep shades of red and purple. Understand?� Kevin nodded. �We need to know why you took an overdose in order to treat the problem so it doesn&#8217;t occur again. Lives as young as yours are too precious to lose. Now have a drink of water and compose yourself and then tell us about the events that led to your taking the pills.�
�
Finally Kevin started. �The inquiry into the accident absolved the contractors from blame and put it solely on my father, however, because of the adverse publicity, the multi-million conglomerate make annual ex-gratia payments to me of 5,000 credits. In the beginning that amounted to a good deal of money but with inflation, now it&#8217;s not worth that much. Still at the time, my grandparents used it to further my education, which had fallen below standard because of the time I spent in hospitals. From the age of nine, while at Junior School, I out-performed most of my classmates and I got on with things without too much trouble, except not being able to run and play sports, irked me.
�
�I moved up into the Sir Alfred Cunningham School at 11 and things weren&#8217;t too bad there until they pulled down the old 1960&#8217;s building and built a modern new block with everything unisex and co-ed as is the fashion these days. At thirteen, I&#8217;d begun to take an interest in girls, but they showed no interest in me except to make fun of me and play tricks with me stuck in my wheelchair. It became easier when I obtained an airchair and could zoom around faster than them but they still taunted me about my inability to fuck them properly. Some decided to &#8216;give me relief&#8217; like in the old naked in school programmes but they did it painfully hard and left the mess on my clothes or body. I began hating girls. A few were kind but most, well perhaps not really most, but a clique of them, made my life miserable.�
�
�So you admit not all the girls were cruel. Did you make any attempt to get to know them better?� Carol asked.
�
�A few times but that caused the girls to be ridiculed and they left me alone. I actually had sex with one girl but it wasn&#8217;t satisfactory. She wasn&#8217;t fit enough to ride me for long and left me unsatisfied. Worse, she spread the word that I couldn&#8217;t perform and that I couldn&#8217;t keep it hard when inside a girl. This at a time when females had all the trump cards and I didn&#8217;t dare refute it.�
�
�What about relationships with boys?�
�
�I got on well enough with the geeks but not with the sporty types but if you&#8217;re referring to sex with boys, the only time I did was really rape but again, I didn&#8217;t want to admit it and for everyone to know. I went to the toilets at the end of the day before going home and did my then usual trick of pushing my chair hard against a low urinal and peeing into it. A group of older boys came in and one held the chair while the others watched on commented on my prick. It hardened from the attention and one of them rubbed it fully hard. He suggested that I must be one of them if I got hard that quickly from a boy&#8217;s attention. As you probably know, because of the way girls and women, teased and refused sex to boys, many turned to homosexuality. I rightly guessed these boys were homosexuals. They took me to an old barn they used for their activities and carried me up into the loft part where there were several mattresses laid out. They laid me on one, stripped off my clothes and showed me several gay magazines. Another two boys joined us making five of them. They too undressed and one sucked my prick and another forced me to suck his until their interest was taken by my arsehole and they debated who would do it first. I don&#8217;t know who did but they all took a turn and made me suck them afterwards. I didn&#8217;t enjoy it and managed to avoid them afterwards.�
�
�How long ago was that?�
�
�Two or three years.�
�
�So that doesn&#8217;t explain why you took the pills.�
�
�No Miss Carol. That was partly due to the change in the laws. I saw it as a chance to get my own back and to have a girl in my company for a while and then demand that she services me. It didn&#8217;t work out that way. The girls were astute enough to avoid my company and yet I saw girls and boys fucking quite regularly and several girls have been naked in school after being punished so I became very depressed and tried to avoid the girls altogether but the other weekend, Mike, one of the geeks I talked with, said we were invited to a party. When we arrived it was well under way and couples were freely fucking and snogging and I estimated there were more girls than boys so I wondered if at last, I would find a girl. It was not to be. I cruised in my airchair to a girl on her own but she turned and yelled, �Get that legless freak out of here!� I quickly zoomed away and cried all the way home.� Knowing from the sound of his voice that he was near to tears again, Sharon gave him a hug, but eager to finish, Kevin went on, �Alone in my room, I debated what to do and decided to secrete some of Grandma&#8217;s pills. They&#8217;d changed her medication so many times there were pots of unused pills in the bathroom. I checked them on the comms and found some were very potent if taken in quantity. Fortunately or unfortunately, they made me drowsy before I could take enough and when Grandpa found me, he commed the ambulance and they brought me here. I hope you are satisfied now you&#8217;ve humiliated me like this.�
�
�Kevin,� Carol said gently, �Humiliation was never the intention, we needed to understand why you made the decision to end your life like we did with Sharon. I believe you both have the potential to live full and happy lives but for the time being, I shall be in control of them. You threw your lives away; I&#8217;m picking them up and will try to put them together. As with all these psychological things, there&#8217;s a 50/50 chance they will work, or perhaps higher chance than that given the knowledge we have but even though you may not agree or like my methods, you will have to go along with them until I deem you cured or are incurable.�
�
She allowed them to ponder on her words until Sharon asked, �This may seem a silly question, but why can&#8217;t you get a pair of artificial legs. I knew someone who had one and you&#8217;d hardly know it wasn&#8217;t real.�
�
�Bloody stupid question! You saw how much of the stumps I have; next to nothing so there&#8217;s nothing to attach anything too without major surgery and bolting on metal stumps, and that won&#8217;t help much. Go back to sleep girl.�
�
Immediately Sharon tore herself from his arm and would have returned to her bed if Carol hadn&#8217;t restrained her. �Kevin, she asked a perfectly valid question. You knew the answer because you&#8217;ve studied it for years; she came across the problem today and genuinely wanted to know if it would help you. Your outburst hurt her and it may be some time before she tries to help again. Here, and more especially in rehab, you are going to learn to live together, learn to help each other and accept the other&#8217;s deficiencies. Yours and hers. Now give her a hug and if you feel like it, say you&#8217;re sorry.�
�
Sharon didn&#8217;t turn and face him when he pulled her close and he didn&#8217;t proffer an apology.
�
�Well that&#8217;s my questioning done for today, a robocar will pick you up in the morning about 10 a.m. I&#8217;ll get the matron now and give her the instructions for your care.�
�
�Oooh, two in a bed but they don&#8217;t look all that happy,� Barbara commented.
�
�They&#8217;ve just had a lover&#8217;s tiff,� Carol laughed, �They&#8217;ll have to sleep in separate beds but all the rest of the time they are to be together. Insist they help each other, make her wash him, make him brush her hair, anything they can do for the other, make them do it, even if they can easily do it themselves. We have to start getting them to bond.
�
�
Rehab
�
�Hi, I&#8217;m Jean a patient assistant and it is my job to see after your comforts. Normally I&#8217;m put with single men or women so you can guess the comforts I provide but you are to comfort each other. This is your room. Dr. Tinsley will be in to see you later but she&#8217;s left me with instructions. You are to undress and help each other in the same way as you have been doing in the hospital. They put those two rings hanging from the ceiling so you can pull yourself into bed like you are used to doing, but most of the time Miss Sharon will help you. They thought it would hurt her body if she had to lift you into bed. They&#8217;ve sent security people to your homes to collect your belongings, your comms units and school stuff��
�
�And my airchair, I hope.�
�
�No Sir, I understand that has been impounded and you have to use the manual one we&#8217;ve provided and Sharon must push you.�
�
�Shit!�
�
�Swearing is a punishable offense Sir, and I ought to smack your bottom for it but I&#8217;ll ignore it this time.� She grinned and they knew it was an idle threat. �I&#8217;ll leave you to settle in and come back in an hour and show you around the centre and take you to the cafeteria. You are not to wear clothes inside the building, but most of the patients are naked too so you won&#8217;t feel out of place except that you are the only teenagers in here, the rest are all ancient, over forty at least.� The girl chatted in a friendly way before leaving them alone.
�
Carol visited during the afternoon and reaffirmed they would be eating, sleeping and playing together for the near future but her final statement brought them most concern. �I will arrange for your return to school as soon as I think you are strong enough, mentally and physically.� She refused to be drawn further, saying, �It has yet to be arranged, but I don&#8217;t wish you to lose too much school time.�
�
She also arranged for Sharon to have a brain scan at the hospital. �I had one when I first went there,� Sharon volunteered. At a meeting the following day at the Health Centre after the results of the scan had been downloaded, the consultant informed them, �Had she been given the correct treatment at the beginning she would probably be over the dyslexia by now. As it is, she is worse than when it happened. It appears that a junior doctor examined her and correctly sent her for the scan. It showed a small area of brain contusion. The hospital consultant didn&#8217;t even look at the scan but said she had mild concussion and sent her home. The trauma and violent shaking of her head during the punishment sessions, aggravated the contusion and it is now larger than when it first happened and her recovery will take very much longer. We will, of course, start treatment to try and reduce the contusion but with brain injury often it is better to leave well alone and let it heal itself. Drugs can often have unwanted side effects that can be permanent. We may be able to sue the consultant for negligence and the staff at the school for not accepting her word for the affliction and for making the injury worse. Maybe we should consult one of the no-pay injury solicitor firms.� The thought of a prolonged period of dyslexia depressed Sharon but a hug from Kevin reassured her a little.
�
�
�You shouldn&#8217;t be doing that for yourself,� Sharon whispered. �What time is it?�
�
�The clocks on the�� Kevin remembered and answered, �12:22. Did I wake you?�
�
�Not really. I&#8217;m not used to sleeping with anyone but I expect we&#8217;ll get used to it. Let me rub it for you because I expect someone is watching on the internal comms circuit.� She slid her hand down Kevin&#8217;s stomach until she felt his hard prick and gently began wanking it. �You could do it to me too,� she suggested taking his hand and placing it on her mound. �No, you don&#8217;t have to stick your finger in, just massage the area in circles and then concentrate on my clittie.� With muffled giggles, they played with each other until Kevin spurted his load and Sharon leaned over to get a tissue to clean the mess.
�
�You didn&#8217;t cum, did you?�
�
�No, but I got close and I enjoyed it. You&#8217;ll just have to practice a little more,� she grinned and snuggled to him.
�
�You&#8217;re hard again or doesn&#8217;t this thing ever go down?� she remarked after they&#8217;d dozed for a few hours.
�
�Its not used to having a warm body next to it. Are you going to give me relief again?�
�
�Only if you return the favour and we do it so I don&#8217;t have a lot of sticky goo to clean up.� To Kevin&#8217;s surprise, she pushed him further down the bed and climbed on top of him in the sixty-nine position. Even in the subdued night time lighting, he clearly saw and smelled the moisture oozing from her cunt. �I suck your prick and you suck and lick my slit,� forcing the issue by pressing her womanhood on his face and raising herself slightly to give him room to perform. Quickly getting the idea and being aroused from Sharon&#8217;s sucking of his prick, Kevin performed with more enthusiasm than Sharon expected and this time she climaxed twice before he came.
�
�Yes, I enjoyed it,� he admitted when they discussed it after breakfast, �But I would have liked to put my prick in you and done it properly.�
�
�Patience Kevin, my back muscles are still rather painful if I try and use them, but before long, we will fuck, if not in the conventional way and not like those two old farts in the corner.� The both grinned at the sight of an elderly couple trying to perform when the man could only get a weak erection.
�
Two evenings later, Sharon made good her promise. �Lie on your back with your prick under the ceiling rings.� She pulled him into the position she wanted and, gripping the rings, straddled him and lowered herself until his prick entered her opening. �You&#8217;ll have to help as well by using your arms to lift my bum while I&#8217;ll do what I can lifting myself by pulling on the rings.� After a few false starts and much laughing, they managed to get into a rhythm and for the first time they fucked and he shot his seed into her womb, not that it would fertilise anything, but it gave him great satisfaction.
�
During the day, Carol interviewed them separately and together about their lives before their suicide attempts and their relationship together. It pleased her that they were co-operating and that Sharon had taken on the responsibility for moving Kevin around and seeing after his welfare. Other doctors examined them physically and tried to assess the like outcome of Sharon&#8217;s dyslexia. At one meeting with Carol, Sharon expressed her grave fear of returning to school and not being able to do any of the work and getting into trouble again. �That won&#8217;t happen,� Carol reassured her but her words didn&#8217;t fully convince Sharon.
�
�Why not treat her as being blind?� Kevin&#8217;s suggestion shocked them both. �The text to speech programmes are pretty good these days and so is speech to text once it has learned the idiosyncrasies of a person&#8217;s voice. It&#8217;s not an ideal solution but it&#8217;s better than nothing. Certainly in English and other lessons where we need to read and write, it could be useful, if rather slow. It could work for maths too but that might be a bigger problem in that she&#8217;ll have to visualise the whole sum in her mind. I think it is worth a try.� The discussion that followed highlighted some difficulties but many were surmountable and Carol agreed to look into getting the programme installed on Sharon&#8217;s comms unit.
�
�
�Good morning boys and girls,� Dr. Lewis, long time headmaster of the Sir Alfred Cunningham School, started assembly as he always did but went on, �Today we welcome back Kevin Syson after his spell in hospital. I&#8217;m sure you all know the story. For the time being, he is without his airchair and won&#8217;t be zooming around and terrorising the younger pupils. Instead he has a girl-powered chair. We welcome Sharon Kidman to the school and hope her stay with us will be profitable, educationally and socially. Most of you will have seen the newscasts of her suicide attempt too and know she has severe trauma-induced dyslexia. The effect is that she cannot translate written words and figures into normal speech. To put it in a way you might understand, it is as though words are written in a cryptic, undecipherable code. We are trying a different programme that we believe may help but it will make her work much more difficult and slower than normal.
�
To help with this, we&#8217;ve put her in the mentor programme with Kevin as her mentor, but, because at her previous school she received an inappropriate amount of punishment for something that wasn&#8217;t her fault, she will not receive the usual 25 with the strap given when a pupil&#8217;s work has fallen below standard. Staff are asked to note the medical information on her before inflicting any punishment or any involvement in strenuous activity. While Kevin is in charge of raising her standard of education, Sharon is in charge of his physical well-being. Yes, that is unusual in these times, but for obvious reasons, it is necessary. However, I felt that some punishment is necessary, for her and for Kevin for seeking to take their lives.� Kevin and Sharon looked shocked at the announcement. �In consultation with their therapist they are both being placed in the Naked in School Punishment Programme and will therefore remain naked whilst in school and outside when the temperature rises above 20C and they will wear the blue collar and cuffs that identify participants in the programme. Other than that, you will treat them as normal students and with the usual courtesy we expect from students at this school.� Turning to the pair before him at the front of the hall, he went on, �Please undress.�
�
Having been naked at the Mental Health Care Trust and many times at her previous school, this wasn&#8217;t as embarrassing for Sharon as it was for Kevin. With his back to the students he took his shirt off and lifted himself to allow Sharon to remove his &#8216;trousers&#8217; and then she too, took her clothes off and stood naked in front of the school.
�
�I think you can see why I thought further punishment unnecessary,� the head went on while a teacher put on the collar and cuffs, �The bruises you see are three weeks old.�
�

�
Epilogue
�
Two weeks after their return to school, Kevin received a comm message from George, his grandfather, �Please come as soon as you can, your grandmother is fading fast.� Sharon had met the old lady twice and wasn&#8217;t sure if she liked her. Her sharp mind contrasted with slurred speech and she&#8217;d asked penetrating and embarrassing questions about Sharon&#8217;s life and future. This time the old lady looked peaceful and serene. She opened her eyes and beckoned Sharon to come close and in a frail voice whispered, �Look after him girl, he&#8217;s a good lad really but he needs someone to keep him under control.�
�
After the funeral a tired and haggard looking George said, �I&#8217;m going to move into Kevin&#8217;s old room and you two can have our bedroom. I don&#8217;t need a double bed now and the memories that go with it. See when the health clinic will release you and we&#8217;ll decorate the room and freshen things up a bit.� By the beginning of November they&#8217;d moved in although they still had regular appointments with Carol.
�
The injury claim solicitors did their job, a job made easier by the TED machine, to get an agreed award for Sharon. 10,000 credits each from Mr. Eccles, Mr. Matthews the teachers who tormented her most at school, 10,000 from the headmaster for not stopping the excessive punishment and 20,000 from the consultant who admitted not having studied the scan due to overwork. Her father and mother were reprimanded for their abuse and for not taking action to prevent her abuse at school.
�
Further brain scans indicated the contusion was slowly shrinking but as Christmas approached, her dyslexia almost remained the same. Occasionally a sentence or two would appear correctly which gave her a little hope that eventually she would recover.
�
�Are you coming to the pre-Christmas party tonight?� Helen one of their new-found friends asked, �We can celebrate your coming off the Naked in School scheme. We know you and Kevin fuck, so it shouldn&#8217;t be a problem for him now and no one is going to yell at him for being there.� They did and, although, alcohol was forbidden to Sharon, when the party ended in a mini-orgy, to the accompaniment of syncopated clapping and much to the admiration and amusement of the others, she demonstrated how they fucked. Some even tried to follow their example.
