Sky&#8217;s the Limit
Ch. 1 and 2

This story has been adjusted so that the main characters are 18.&nbsp; This is also a story filled with violence, rape, abuse and death.&nbsp; If you feel you may be overly disturbed by these topics, please do not read any further.&nbsp; Some of the actions by Tyler Lasko, have been cut, due to his age at the time, but are hinted at in later chapters.&nbsp; None of this story is true and it is all a figment of my warped imagination.&nbsp; Thank you.
Chapter 1

Tyler Lasko had always been a good looking young man, dark hair, beautiful brown eyes that crinkled around the edges when he smiled, and a face that screamed of innocence.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t that he was innocent; he just never got into any trouble because he had a way about him.&nbsp; By a very early age, Tyler could make anyone believe that he could do no wrong.&nbsp; 

As Tyler reached his teenage years, he began noticing girls or more to the point, one girl in particular.&nbsp; The fact that her name was Skyler was even more attractive to him, feeling pleasure when saying their names together, always bringing a smile to his face and heat to his groin. 
 
Skyler was a blonde haired, blue eyed beauty with a great body and such a mild temperament, that she was envied by all who knew her.&nbsp; 

Tyler had been watching Skyler at a very early age and by the time they were in the eighth grade; he was watching her almost nonstop.&nbsp; He would peer at her through the windows of her home and follow her at a distance when she was out of the house.&nbsp; 

Skyler was friendly to everyone and Tyler mimicked her behavior, striving for the same level of popularity.&nbsp; 

As Tyler observed Skyler, it entered his mind that she wasn&#8217;t like other girls.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t watch the boys as they walked past her, but she did watch some of the girls when she thought nobody was looking.&nbsp; It occurred to him that Skyler was a lesbian, but he didn&#8217;t care and he continued watching her through high school, trying to come up with a way to make her his.&nbsp; 

By the time Tyler had finished ninth grade, he had a complete darkroom set up, along with some of the best camera equipment ever sold.&nbsp; Along with his new hobby in photography, Tyler decided that a room only he could get into was completely necessary.&nbsp; He began taking photographs of Skyler at every opportunity, knowing her every move, right down to when she would brush her teeth at night, capturing it all on film.
&nbsp; 
The locked room didn&#8217;t take very long at all to completely fill with pictures of Skyler.&nbsp; Tyler would spend many hours in this room, dreaming of the day when Skyler would belong to him alone.

Skyler would spend these years completely oblivious to the obsessions of Tyler.&nbsp; She had spoken to him many times in school, along with other kids, but she had never been made aware during a single conversation that he had any extra feelings for her.&nbsp; She had even gone to a party at his house one night and even though the two of them had a conversation on the sofa for a short time about teachers and college, it was Tyler who eventually left to mingle.&nbsp; 

After Skyler had left Tyler&#8217;s party, he locked himself in his dark room, unloading the film from the camera that had been taking still shots of Skyler and him on the sofa.&nbsp; As he developed them, he liked how they looked together; making him more determined that she needed to be his.

By the time Skyler Davis had turned 18, the only thing that could be said about her, was that she was drop-dead gorgeous with her blonde hair, blue eyes and great tits.&nbsp; The fact that she was a sweet girl only made her more appealing to Tyler. 
 
Skyler had never cared for the school cliques, choosing to have a large circle of friends, rather than just a few close ones.&nbsp; She was nice to everyone and generally everyone was nice to her.&nbsp; She had never been influenced by peer pressure, but every so often, it did get to her, along with a mother who wanted to know why she didn&#8217;t have a boyfriend yet.&nbsp; If only she could think of a good way to keep anyone from finding out she was gay until college, life would be perfect.

Tyler Lasko was still the best looking boy in school at 18.&nbsp; He was polite and he still had eyes that crinkled when he smiled.&nbsp; With his mustache stubble and just the slightest amount of chest hair, running in a thin trail down past his navel, every girl wanted him to ask her out.
&nbsp; 
Over the years, Tyler had become even more devious and sneaky about watching Skyler.&nbsp; It still didn&#8217;t matter to him that she was a lesbian; he wanted her and became single-minded in his obsession.&nbsp; He was positive he had finally figured out a way to make her his.&nbsp; 

Tyler had another secret that even he didn&#8217;t know; it was one that wasn&#8217;t easily spotted.&nbsp; Tyler Lasko was a sociopath and in his entire 18 years, he could tell a straight out lie, actually believing it to be true; that ability was about to come in handy.&nbsp; 

The night Tyler saw Skyler at the end of summer party; he was determined to put his plan into action.&nbsp; He walked up to the group of girls, asking Skyler if he could have a word alone with her.&nbsp; As Skyler began following him, she turned and smiled at the girls she had been talking to as they began whispering.&nbsp; She knew that every single one of them was wishing they were her at that moment.&nbsp; 

Skyler had always thought Tyler was a nice boy, she had even considered asking him out once, but decided it wouldn&#8217;t be fair to lead him on, knowing she wanted to be with someone completely different. 
 
As they walked down to his car, he jumped on the front of it while Skyler slid up beside him.

�What&#8217;s up Tyler?�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;ve been keeping a secret, but I just need to tell somebody and you&#8217;ve always seemed like someone who could be trusted.&nbsp; Can I trust you Skyler, I mean, really trust you?�&nbsp; Tyler asked her with a tear in his eye.
�Sure you can Tyler, what&#8217;s wrong?�&nbsp; She asked, touching his arm.
�I� I&#8217;m� shit this is hard,� Tyler began, looking towards the sky.
�It&#8217;s okay Tyler, I promise, I won&#8217;t say a word,� Skyler insisted.
�I&#8217;m gay,� Tyler blurted out, turning to look at her face after a moment.&nbsp; �Are you disgusted?�&nbsp; 
�God no Tyler!&nbsp; I understand completely, I mean, as long as you&#8217;ve told me your secret, I guess my secret would be safe with you, wouldn&#8217;t it?�&nbsp; 
�After that, you can tell me anything.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m gay too Tyler.�&nbsp; 
�You aren&#8217;t messin&#8217; with me, are you?�&nbsp; 
�I swear,� she insisted.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t want it getting around right now though, just like you wouldn&#8217;t, I&#8217;m sure.�&nbsp; 
�I wouldn&#8217;t tell anyone, I promise, but I also wanted to ask you a little favor, maybe it could benefit us both in the end.�&nbsp; 
�What sorta favor?�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;ve been getting harassed a lot lately, especially at home and I thought that since you&#8217;re not seeing anyone; you aren&#8217;t, are you?�&nbsp; Tyler thought to ask first.
�No, I&#8217;m really not,� Skyler smiled.
�I just thought that maybe, we could pretend to be dating for a little while, so everyone would back off?�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;ve been getting a lot more shit lately too, especially from my mom,� Skyler admitted, actually considering it.
�So you think you might wanna, maybe?�&nbsp; He asked.
�Sure, why not?&nbsp; Even if it&#8217;s only for a little while, people would back off then.�&nbsp; 

Skyler hopped off the car hood, holding her hand out to Tyler.&nbsp; Score, he thought to himself as he put his hand into hers, shaking it.&nbsp; 

As they began walking back to the party, Tyler slipped his hand into Skyler&#8217;s.&nbsp; She looked up at him, smiling and confirming that everything was falling into place.&nbsp; 

Tyler started the school year off properly, picking Skyler up that morning and driving her.&nbsp; They walked into school holding hands and it didn&#8217;t take long for word to get around that they were a couple.&nbsp; He walked Skyler to all of her classes and on the weekends they would cruise the streets with Skyler sitting close to Tyler so the other kids could see them together.&nbsp; 

Generally when they drove around town, they would talk about school or their families.&nbsp; Skyler would especially talk about her cat, Frisbee and all of the things he use to do when he was a kitten.&nbsp; She explained that she had gotten Frisbee for a birthday gift when she was three years old and he generally followed her wherever she went when she was home.&nbsp; Tyler laughed at all of her stories, hanging on every word, still unable to believe that she was sitting beside him in his car.&nbsp; 

After a month of faux dating, Skyler invited Tyler over to dinner with her family.&nbsp; The night went extremely well.&nbsp; Her parents and little sister adored Tyler, thinking he was the perfect gentleman, polite and extremely gracious. 
 
Whenever they were around people, especially in school they would always give one another a quick kiss hello and goodbye.&nbsp; At parties, they would occasionally neck, once Tyler convinced her that it would really throw off suspicion.&nbsp; 

At one particular party, after a very lengthy necking session, Skyler leaned forward, giving Tyler a hug.

�You&#8217;re not supposed to be getting that excited when you&#8217;re kissing me,� Skyler whispered, noticing the bulge in his pants.
�What if I&#8217;m seeing someone else when I&#8217;m kissing you?�&nbsp; He whispered.
�Who?�&nbsp; Skyler asked with a smile.&nbsp; �Tell me, I wanna know what kinda guys you like.�&nbsp; 
�You tell me about girls first,� Tyler insisted, buying some time.
�Me first?&nbsp; Let me think for a minute... real, or someone I wouldn&#8217;t have a chance to get near in a million years?�&nbsp; 
�Real first,� Tyler instructed as Skyler began looking around the party.
�Hmm, I would have to say, Nikki Freeman and for the outta leaguer, Madonna.�&nbsp; 
�Those are two completely different looks.�&nbsp; 
�Well, Nikki&#8217;s pretty hot, with the long dark hair and the pierced naval, but Madonna&#8217;s gorgeous, now you.�&nbsp; 
�I guess, Joshua Kentz, because of his dimples, and for the other one, I&#8217;m almost embarrassed to say,� Tyler began, leaning his head against Skyler&#8217;s as he blushed.&nbsp; �Michael Fox, I just think he&#8217;s so little and cute.� 
�I like him, he is cute and as far as real guys go, Josh is pretty hot,� Skyler admitted as she felt Tyler&#8217;s body twitch.&nbsp; �What just happened?�&nbsp; 
�Nothing, why, did something just happen?�&nbsp; 
�You just flinched when I agreed that Josh was hot.�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t remember that.&nbsp; You wanna get outta here?�&nbsp; Tyler asked.&nbsp; �Maybe we could go watch a movie at my place or something, before I take you home?�&nbsp; 
�I should be getting home anyway,� Skyler explained, suddenly feeling uncomfortable.&nbsp; �My dad hasn&#8217;t been feeling very well lately and I should get home before he goes to bed so I don&#8217;t wake him up.�&nbsp; 
�Sure, I understand, c&#8217;mon, I&#8217;ll drive ya,� Tyler offered as they walked to his car.

That was the day Skyler began having doubts about Tyler and his honesty, but she stuck it out with some limitations for almost three months.&nbsp; She had begun staying home more, spending time with her family, but there were still nights when Tyler would show up and watch television with them.&nbsp; 

Skyler&#8217;s family loved him and enjoyed when Tyler would stop in to visit, even inviting him to her sister, Heather&#8217;s birthday party and loving him more after he helped clean up the mess.&nbsp; This was the final straw for Skyler, making her realize it was time to put an end to their, so-called relationship.

Tyler knew he was losing his grip on Skyler and it had been getting more difficult to keep his hands off her.&nbsp; She was his, she just hadn&#8217;t realized it yet, but she would soon enough.&nbsp; He knew he would need to make his next move sooner than he had originally planned.

The following day after school, Tyler was waiting for Skyler by her locker.&nbsp; She stopped when she first saw him, eventually continuing on to put her books away.&nbsp; 

�Tyler, I don&#8217;t wanna do this anymore.�&nbsp; 
�What&#8217;re you talking about?�&nbsp; Tyler asked as she began walking away from him.
�This just isn&#8217;t working for me anymore Tyler,� Skyler continued walking.&nbsp; �I wanna thank you for helping me out and all, but I just wanna go the rest of the way alone.&nbsp; I still wanna be friends, if that&#8217;d be okay with you?�&nbsp; 
�Please don&#8217;t do this yet?&nbsp; Can&#8217;t we just hold off until schools over?�&nbsp; Tyler begged once he caught up to her.
�Tyler, we&#8217;ve been going out for a few months already, nobody&#8217;s gonna bug us anymore, we&#8217;ll be fine until school&#8217;s over.�&nbsp; 
�Are you going to the Christmas party tonight?�&nbsp; Tyler asked calmly, trying not to panic.
�I think so, Jenny&#8217;s picking me up I think.�&nbsp; 
�You already told people you were breaking up with me?�&nbsp; 
�No, I never said we broke up, I just said we were taking a little break,� Skyler explained.&nbsp; �And I only told Jenny.�&nbsp; 
�Can we maybe talk more tonight?�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything else to talk about Tyler.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s just leave it at what it was, okay?�&nbsp; Skyler asked, leaving Tyler to stare after her.

Chapter 2

Tyler didn&#8217;t take the breakup very well at all.&nbsp; It was obvious to him that Skyler truly didn&#8217;t understand her place yet, and it made him incredibly angry.&nbsp; The first thing he did was to go home and rip down one entire wall of Skyler&#8217;s photographs, cursing her as he cried.&nbsp; After he finished with his tantrum, he spent the rest of the afternoon putting them back up.&nbsp; He calmed down by going through this process, knowing that by the end of the night, Skyler would be his forever.

Skyler had been talking to a boy at the party; David Klasp was explaining a school project they had been working on.&nbsp; She noticed Tyler staring at them and looking agitated, but she chose to ignore him.&nbsp; David excused himself to go into the woods, while Skyler took that opportunity to talk with a group of girls for a few minutes.&nbsp; When the girls began asking where Tyler was, Skyler merely shrugged her shoulders after scanning the crowd, explaining how she had decided they needed to take a break for a little while.&nbsp; She spent some time discussing how everything had come about, without going into too much detail, until she was suddenly being pulled away from the group by Tyler.&nbsp; 

Skyler pulled loose from Tyler&#8217;s grip once they rounded the corner, only to have him hit her alongside the head.&nbsp; They were far enough away from the party, so nobody saw it and the music was loud enough to drown out her cry from the pain.&nbsp; He knew better than to leave any marks on her face, but the side of her head was fair game.&nbsp; Skyler grabbed her head as she fell into the snow bank, not exactly positive about what was happening.&nbsp; Tyler grabbed her by the arm again, pulling her up and dragging her to the car, pushing her in from the driver&#8217;s side.

�What in the hell&#8217;re you doing?!�&nbsp; 
�Shut the fuck up!�&nbsp; He shouted, driving towards town.&nbsp; �What the fuck were you doing with him?!�&nbsp; 
�We were talking about a school project.&nbsp; Tyler, what&#8217;s up with you?&nbsp; What in the hell is this?�&nbsp; She asked, feeling a little frightened, but trying to stay calm.
�You&#8217;re my girl!&nbsp; You belong with me, not fucking around with other guys!�&nbsp; 
�Tyler, you know I&#8217;m not interested in guys at all and I&#8217;m not your girl, not for real, we just talked about all of this today!�&nbsp; 
�No, you&#8217;re mine now,� Tyler calmly, shook his head.
�I don&#8217;t belong to anyone,� she informed him.&nbsp; �I thought you were gay?�&nbsp; 
�You&#8217;re so dense sometimes,� Tyler remarked, staring at her.

Skyler attempted to open the door, not caring if she threw herself out of the car while it was moving, but Tyler grabbed her by the hair, pulling her towards him.&nbsp; As the door shut again, he pushed her head, hard into the passenger window.&nbsp; Skyler fought a losing battle to stay conscious.&nbsp; The last thing she heard was Tyler telling her how much he loved her.
 
By the time Skyler was coming to, she was lying on Tyler&#8217;s bed without any clothes on and he was lying beside her, naked as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

As she was opening her mouth to scream, Tyler clamped his hand over it, crawling on top of her.&nbsp; She was fighting to get away from him, but he held her hands above her head before calmly speaking.&nbsp; 

�You need to calm down and listen to me,� Tyler advised.&nbsp; �This is gonna happen, whether you want it to or not, so it&#8217;s up to you if you wanna keep fighting with me.&nbsp; You&#8217;re just gonna make me hurt you more if you keep struggling.&nbsp; You belong to me and that&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s supposed to be.&nbsp; I&#8217;m gonna take my hand away from your mouth now, but if you scream, I&#8217;m gonna bash you in the head again, understand?�&nbsp; 

Skyler looked Tyler in the eyes, wondering how he could have changed overnight.&nbsp; She knew she was about to be raped, but she could see something in his eyes at that moment and it frightened her more than the thought of being raped.&nbsp; She nodded her head as she stopped struggling. 
 
Tyler slowly removed his hand from her mouth, and even though she was still crying, he knew she wouldn&#8217;t give him anymore trouble.&nbsp; Giving her one of his best smiles, he caressed her cheek, wiping away a tear.&nbsp; He kissed her, but she was having trouble returning his kisses as she was still crying, so he moved down, kissing and suckling one nipple, while tweaking and pinching the other.&nbsp; He continued holding her hands above her head, until he could be sure she wouldn&#8217;t try to run.&nbsp; 

Skyler hated the fact that her body betrayed her the way it did, with small moans and whimpers escaping from her lips.&nbsp; Tyler smiled, gradually loosening his grip on her wrists.&nbsp; When she still wasn&#8217;t fighting him, he continued kissing his way down her stomach.&nbsp; 

Skyler couldn&#8217;t understand how Tyler was making her feel so good, when she was so frightened.&nbsp; Try as she might, she couldn&#8217;t fight the sounds of pleasure escaping her mouth, especially after he spread her legs apart, pushing his tongue into her vagina, while he fondled her nipples with his fingers.&nbsp; The only thing she could think of doing was to close her eyes and grasp the blanket with her hands as she felt Tyler&#8217;s tongue moving through the center of her pussy lips, up to her clit where he flitted it with his tongue, causing her to gasp and involuntarily thrust her hips towards his face.&nbsp; 

All the little peeps and squeaks escaping Skyler were like music to Tyler&#8217;s ears.&nbsp; He couldn&#8217;t remember ever feeling so happy.&nbsp; It only got better as he lowered his hand to stretch her vagina.&nbsp; He knew it was going to hurt her anyway, but he didn&#8217;t want to hurt her any more than necessary, so he slowly began pushing his fingers into her hole, first one around and slowly he put in two more, twisting and stretching her.&nbsp; 

Just as Skyler thought she was going to have an orgasm; Tyler removed his fingers and tongue, making his way back up her body until they were face-to-face again.&nbsp; Slowly she opened her eyes, wanting the orgasm and yet hoping he had changed his mind, but he hadn&#8217;t.

�This is the part that&#8217;s gonna hurt a little at first, but it&#8217;ll feel better once we get going,� he explained, �but you still better not scream.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t wanna hurt you, but it doesn&#8217;t mean I won&#8217;t.�&nbsp; 

Skyler nodded as the tears began sliding out of the corners of her eyes again when she felt the head of Tyler&#8217;s penis being moved around between her pussy lips, just before he began guiding it into her vagina, taking her breath away.&nbsp; Tyler moved in and almost out, before, slowly pushing in again until he felt the little barrier.&nbsp; It was the only thing stopping him from becoming one with Skyler and with one quick push, it wasn&#8217;t.

As Tyler broke through her hymen, Skyler&#8217;s eyes opened wide as a small squeak escaped from her mouth.&nbsp; It hurt like hell and the pressure made her feel horribly uncomfortable, but at least, after a short time, it didn&#8217;t hurt anymore.&nbsp; She closed her eyes again until Tyler told her to look at him.&nbsp; 

Slowly, Skyler looked up at his face and he told her he loved her before slapping her alongside the head, telling her she needed to tell him she loved him too.&nbsp; Once she cooperated, he instructed her to wrap her legs around him and to tweak his nipples.&nbsp; 

When Tyler knew he was about ready to cum, he reached down, swirling a finger around Skyler&#8217;s clit again, until she was cumming with him.&nbsp; Tyler collapsed on top of Skyler after emptying his jism into her, leaving his penis inside, until he had the strength to roll off to the side.

Skyler lay quietly sobbing as she asked him, why over and over again. 

�I told you why.&nbsp; You didn&#8217;t think you belonged to me, but I know you do.�
�But why?�&nbsp; She cried.
�We&#8217;re finished discussing this.&nbsp; You plan on telling anyone?�&nbsp; He asked, watching her shake her head.&nbsp; �Gee, why don&#8217;t I believe you?�&nbsp; 
�I promise, I won&#8217;t tell anyone.�&nbsp; 
�I know you won&#8217;t.&nbsp; You know how I know?�&nbsp; He asked, as she stared, blankly at him.&nbsp; �Because unless you want me to hurt your little sister and your parents, you won&#8217;t say a fucking word to anyone and now you&#8217;re mine, so unless you want me to start hurting the people around you, you&#8217;re gonna do what I want you to do, understand me?�&nbsp; Tyler asked this with absolutely no hostility or emotion involved.&nbsp; All Skyler could do, was nod.

�I think you should give me a blowjob,� Tyler suggested, testing the rules.
�I� I don&#8217;t know how?�&nbsp; Skyler said as her voice shook.
�Just play with my balls and suck my cock.� 
�I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll fit.�
�You&#8217;ll learn how and you&#8217;ll learn to love it.� 

Skyler moved onto her stomach down to Tyler&#8217;s penis, seriously doubting it would fit as she watched it grow, plus it had blood and cum on it, making her feel queasy.&nbsp; Skyler was just about to beg him, not to make her touch it until she could clean it off, when Tyler reached down, slapping her across the back of the head and snapped Skyler out of her daze.&nbsp; 

She moved one hand to begin massaging his testicles as she slowly moved her face closer to Tyler&#8217;s penis.&nbsp; Skyler thought she might get rid of some of the mess, if she used her other hand to help her mouth, but she wound up getting smacked on the ass for that idea.&nbsp; Giving up on finding any way out of what she was supposed to do, Skyler ran her tongue up and down the shaft, taking the head into her mouth until the only nasty spots left, where in Tyler&#8217;s pubic hairs.&nbsp; She was seriously hoping he didn&#8217;t expect her to clean that up too, but another whack, on her already sore ass, said otherwise.&nbsp; 

Tyler slid his hand up Skyler&#8217;s thigh, making her jump as he swatted her on the ass yet again, telling her to slide closer to him. 

Skyler started having trouble keeping track of what she was doing when Tyler ran his fingers through her pussy, causing her to scrape her teeth too hard over his penis.&nbsp; This, in turn brought about another ass slap.&nbsp; 

Tyler began directing Skyler, telling her exactly what he wanted done and how he wanted her to do it.&nbsp; When he wanted her to go all the way down on him, she gagged, causing him to slap her ass.&nbsp; Every time she began to gag, he would slap her in the same spot and it was beginning to hurt.&nbsp; When Tyler knew he was close to cumming, he fingered Skyler, so she would cum at the same time.

Skyler felt nauseated from swallowing his cum.&nbsp; It was tangy, yet salty all at the same time and she didn&#8217;t care for the smell or the texture, but she shakily smiled when she finished, avoiding another whack on the ass.&nbsp; Skyler crawled up to where Tyler was holding his arm open for her; she wasn&#8217;t sure what he expected her to do, so she just lay there until, he told her to put her arm over his waist.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t want him getting angry with her, but she let him know that she was going to be grounded if she wasn&#8217;t home on time.&nbsp; After making her kiss him, he let her get dressed.

As Tyler drove her home, he let Skyler know he would be picking her up for breakfast at seven the following morning, and she had better be ready.&nbsp; Kissing her goodnight, he reminded her that if she said anything to anybody at all, he would hurt her entire family, starting with her little sister.&nbsp; Skyler promised she wouldn&#8217;t say a word to anyone before giving him the required kiss and going into the house.

Skyler had taken such a hot shower before crawling into bed, that it felt as though her skin would peel right off.&nbsp; She felt dirty and trapped as she curled up.&nbsp; 

All she wanted to do was to wake her parents and tell them exactly what had happened to her, but she knew she couldn&#8217;t.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t exactly sure why she believed Tyler would hurt her family, but something in his eyes made her believe him.&nbsp; As Skyler cried, she pulled her cat, Frisbee, as close to her as he would allow.

Tyler knew he needed to get his point across to Skyler, so he waited until he was sure the entire family was asleep, before letting himself into the house.&nbsp; The deadbolt was put on wrong, making him laugh out loud.&nbsp; It had to have been the easiest door that he had broken into and such a stupid mistake, not that it would have kept him out, but it still made things entirely too easy.&nbsp; 

Whenever things were easy for Tyler, he always took that as a sign he was doing the right thing. 
 
Tyler made his way up to Skyler&#8217;s room and even though her door was locked, it was also easy to open.&nbsp; Using the metal toothpick on his pocket knife, he popped the door open immediately.&nbsp; 

With the moonlight shining through Skyler&#8217;s window, Tyler likened her to an angel, soon to be his angel forever and he smiled to himself at the thought.&nbsp; 

Frisbee lifted his head to look at Tyler, but he never moved.&nbsp; The cat&#8217;s attitude was seriously pissing Tyler off, making him feel as though the cat were taunting him, that he would always be closer to Skyler, than Tyler would ever be.&nbsp; He reached down, lifting Frisbee off the bed, leaving the room after one more look at Skyler.&nbsp; She was his and after that night, she would start to know her place.&nbsp; 

Tyler left the house the same way he had gone in and once they were outside, he began petting Frisbee.

�Sorry it had to end this way old man, but after tonight, I&#8217;ll be the only one she needs for anything, ever again,� Tyler explained, smiling at Frisbee.

With one quick snap, Frisbee stopped purring and went limp in Tyler&#8217;s arms.&nbsp; The cat was then positioned to make it look as though he were trying to get up the front steps, but couldn&#8217;t.&nbsp; Tyler walked to his car, laughing all the way.&nbsp; He had a date in the morning and he was positive he was going to sleep better than ever.

Skyler woke up to screaming the following morning and ran downstairs to find her mother with her back against the door.

�What&#8217;s wrong mom?�&nbsp; Skyler asked fearfully.&nbsp; �What is it?&nbsp; Are you okay?�&nbsp; 
�Did you let Frisbee out when you came home last night?�&nbsp; Asia Davis asked.&nbsp; 
�No!&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t do that!&nbsp; He was sleeping with me!&nbsp; Where is he?� 
�Just go back upstairs until your father takes him off the porch.�&nbsp; 
�No, I wanna see him!&nbsp; Was he hurt?&nbsp; What happened?�&nbsp; Skyler cried.&nbsp; �He was sleeping with me, how&#8217;d he get out?� 
�Sky, that&#8217;s impossible,� Asia insisted.&nbsp; �You always sleep with your door shut, there&#8217;s no way he could have gotten out by himself.�&nbsp; 
�But he was sleeping with me� oh god.�&nbsp; Skyler uttered, suddenly realizing what had happened.

Skyler turned, running past her father and sister on the way back to her room, feeling close to hysterical.&nbsp; This all meant that Tyler had been in her room during the night and if he could get into the house that easily, none of them were safe.&nbsp; The only choice she had was to do what he wanted.&nbsp; 

It was 6:00 a.m., when Skyler began to cry as she showered and dressed.&nbsp; She was still crying when she entered the kitchen at 7:00.&nbsp; Tyler walked up, putting his arms around her, expressing how sorry he was about Frisbee.&nbsp; Holding her closer, he quietly instructed her to hug him, making her cry harder.

�Maybe we should wait on going out to breakfast, if you&#8217;re too upset,� Tyler suggested.
�Maybe getting out would do you some good sweetie,� Asia suggested.
�Mom, he just died!�&nbsp; 

Skyler was saying this as her father walked in.&nbsp; Fred Davis was a slight man and hadn&#8217;t had a good day since Skyler was a child.&nbsp; Not having worked in years due to his health, he began coughing as he sat at the table.&nbsp; 

Asia Davis, a short, plump and yet pretty woman, walked over to rub his back.&nbsp; 

�You should&#8217;ve been more careful about keeping him inside honey,� Fred stated sadly.
�I did daddy, he was sleeping with me!�&nbsp; Skyler protested, as Tyler jabbed a finger into her back.&nbsp; �I, I&#8217;m sorry, maybe that was the night before.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry!�&nbsp; She cried.
�I&#8217;m sorry too, he was a good cat,� Fred admitted.&nbsp; �Maybe you &#8216;should&#8217; get out of the house for a little while.�&nbsp; 
�I guess if both of your parents think it&#8217;s a good idea, maybe we should go for breakfast and I&#8217;ll bring you home right after.� 

Skyler nodded her head reluctantly, going to put on her jacket and boots.&nbsp; 

As they got into Tyler&#8217;s car, Skyler put her head down, staring at her fingers.

�Why&#8217;re you doing this to me?�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m not doing anything, I love you and I just want you to love me too.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll learn to love me,� Tyler said, putting his arm around her.

Skyler had no idea how his brain worked.&nbsp; He had raped her, killed her cat and now he expected her to fall in love with him.&nbsp; He had to know the only reason she wasn&#8217;t saying anything was because he scared her half to death.

�What d&#8217;you suppose happened to your cat?�&nbsp; 
�You,� Skyler almost whispered. 
�You actually believe I would hurt your cat?�&nbsp; 
�He was sleeping in my room,� Skyler felt defeated.&nbsp; �I know he was sleeping in my room.�&nbsp; 
�Well, if I did do that and I&#8217;m not saying I did, just imagine how easy it is for me to get into your house.&nbsp; I think it might be a good idea if you start warming up to the fact that you&#8217;re mine and you&#8217;ll always be mine, don&#8217;t you think that might be a good idea?� he asked as she slowly nodded.&nbsp; �So where you wanna eat?�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m not really hungry, so I don&#8217;t care.�&nbsp; 
�Kiss me.�&nbsp; 

Skyler looked into Tyler&#8217;s eyes before moving towards him, giving him a kiss.&nbsp; Tyler smiled at her as he began driving towards his house.&nbsp; 

As they got out of the car, Skyler could see Tyler&#8217;s mother staring at them out the window.&nbsp; Mrs. Lasko was mostly in the shadows, but Skyler could see her eyes quite clearly as they studied her, making Skyler feel dirty.&nbsp; She put her head down when Tyler put his arm around her protectively, before walking her around to the back door.&nbsp; 

In the basement, Tyler led her directly into the bedroom, telling her to undress while he did the same.&nbsp; 

Tyler seemed to have a thing for blowjobs, and he had every intention of having her do them until she got them right, maybe even longer than that since he enjoyed them so much.&nbsp; As he continued instructing her, Tyler explained to her that from that point on, she needed to look at him as though there was nothing else she would rather be doing and she always needed to swallow, unless he decided she didn&#8217;t have to.

Skyler tried getting it all down, but couldn&#8217;t seem to keep from gagging when she gave them to him, even though she wished she could so he would stop slapping her on the ass.&nbsp; She had welts from the night before and he was still hitting the same spot.&nbsp; 

At least Tyler was seeing to it that she was getting some orgasms at the same time he was.&nbsp; Even when he was fucking her, he always made sure she came at the same time he did.&nbsp; 

As he held her after they had finished the first round, Tyler lit a cigarette.

�I didn&#8217;t know you smoked,� Skyler commented as she lay in Tyler&#8217;s arms.
�I have for a while now, I just didn&#8217;t wanna do it around you before,� Tyler explained.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re mine now, so it doesn&#8217;t matter.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t have a problem with it, do you?�&nbsp; 
�No, I don&#8217;t have a problem with it.�&nbsp; 
�Wouldn&#8217;t really matter if you did, I guess.�&nbsp; 
�Can I ask you a question Tyler?&nbsp; Will you promise not to hurt me?�&nbsp; 
�I won&#8217;t hurt you, I love you,� Tyler said, putting out his cigarette.
�I just wanted��&nbsp; Skyler began, until she was slapped alongside the head.&nbsp; 

Skyler was left holding her head, feeling horribly confused.

�You need to learn to tell me you love me when I tell you I love you,� Tyler instructed as Skyler tried keeping herself from crying.
�I&#8217;m sorry, I, I love you,� Skyler said as Tyler slapped her again.
�Next time don&#8217;t hesitate when you tell me you love me and I mean it.&nbsp; You need to do what I want you to do or you&#8217;re just gonna piss me off.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t wanna hurt you; I just need you to do what I tell you to do.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;ll try harder.�&nbsp; 

Tyler moved towards Skyler as she cringed, but he didn&#8217;t hurt her, he held her close as he kissed her head, then her nose and landing on her lips.&nbsp; He began kissing her more until he became aroused again.&nbsp; He began to fondle her breasts, kissing his way down her body, until it occurred to him that while he was working to please her, she wasn&#8217;t even touching him unless he forced her to.&nbsp; 

He pulled her out of the bed by her hair, dragging her to the kitchen table.&nbsp; He pushed her head down sideways onto the table as he roughly pushed his penis into her pussy from behind.&nbsp; Skyler tried making Tyler loosen his grip, compelling him to slam her head against the table top, before ejaculating inside her.&nbsp; When Tyler finished, he pulled her up, slamming her against the wall.

�Don&#8217;t you ever try and stop me again when I&#8217;m doing whatever the fuck it is I&#8217;m doing, you understand?!�&nbsp; 
�I understand, I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m so sorry.�&nbsp; 
�And from now on, if you don&#8217;t start touching me as much as I&#8217;m touching you when we make love, you&#8217;re gonna get more of this kind of treatment, or worse!&nbsp; Got it?!�
�I do, I&#8217;m sorry!&nbsp; I&#8217;m still so new at all of this, I just didn&#8217;t know.�&nbsp; 

Skyler was crying as Tyler pulled her to him, holding her as she tried calming down.&nbsp; He picked her up, as she shakily put her arms around his neck, making him smile before he carried her back to the bedroom.

Skyler was positive that Tyler was insane by then and she knew there was absolutely no way out of the situation unless he either killed her, or she killed him, but she was almost positive that she didn&#8217;t have it in her to kill him, so she would need to deal with each situation as it happened.&nbsp; 

The first up was Christmas and how to spend it.&nbsp; Tyler had made the decision for her, so it was up to her to convince her parents to let her spend the entire day at Tyler&#8217;s house.&nbsp; Unfortunately, they understood completely, telling Skyler stories of past holidays when they were first married and how they were forced to divide their time between families.&nbsp; 

She was beginning to think they would let her do anything, as long as Tyler suggested it first.
&nbsp; 
The first thing Katherine Lasko made clear, was that without a doubt, Skyler wasn&#8217;t welcome upstairs.&nbsp; Tyler smiled, letting his mother know they would be spending the day downstairs, alone.&nbsp; 

Skyler felt as though she wanted to cry when she heard him say it, knowing that at some point, if not already, she was going to wind up pregnant.&nbsp; 

Tyler couldn&#8217;t seem to get enough of her that day and he wanted her everywhere.&nbsp; On the kitchen counter, in the shower, against the wall, over the couch, but he could actually be so sweet at times when he would cuddle her, or feed her fruit, especially since Skyler was getting better at pretending she loved him.&nbsp; 

She always made sure to return any touches, or pleasure, since Skyler was never quite sure what was going to set him off, or when.&nbsp; 

Tyler had shown her where the food and sodas were, but when she went for a soda, he became agitated again before pushing her head down onto the table and raping her.&nbsp; When she asked him why he would even show her if he didn&#8217;t want her touching it, he informed her that it was just general information, in case he wanted something.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t allowed to have anything, unless he offered it to her.&nbsp; 

As Skyler watched the news with her parents one night, the report about a missing boy at the Christmas party came on.&nbsp; David Klasp was the boy Skyler had been talking to about the school project before her entire world began falling apart.&nbsp; She began crying, as it occurred to her that he would&#8217;ve probably been fine, if she hadn&#8217;t spoken to him.&nbsp; She excused herself, going up to bed.&nbsp; 

As she went to take a shower before bed, she looked at her body in the mirror.&nbsp; She was almost one giant bruise and the only place on her body that wasn&#8217;t bruised was her face, but she was almost positive that if she were to shave her head, that would be incredibly bruised as well.&nbsp; 

Skyler decided to soak in a nice hot bubble bath, thinking that with any luck, she would fall asleep and drown.&nbsp; As she crawled into the hot water, she put the washcloth over her eyes and cried.

Fred and Asia Davis had been slightly disturbed by their daughter&#8217;s behavior since Frisbee had been found.&nbsp; As she ran upstairs after the news broadcast about the missing boy, they looked at each other.

�Is she okay?�&nbsp; 
�Well how would I know, she doesn&#8217;t talk to me!�&nbsp; Asia reminded him.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s usually you she goes to when she wants to talk about things.�&nbsp; 
�She hasn&#8217;t said two words to me since Frisbee died.&nbsp; I just thought she told Tyler everything now,� Fred explained.&nbsp; �I asked her the other day if there was something she wanted to talk about and she began this violent head shaking and left the table.�&nbsp; 
�She&#8217;d come to us if there was anything going on, wouldn&#8217;t she?�&nbsp; 
�She always has in the past,� Fred stated as he began coughing violently.

Asia got out of her chair, going to her husband and rubbing his back.&nbsp; It seemed to be the only thing that calmed him lately.&nbsp; As she looked at her frail husband, she couldn&#8217;t help but love him.&nbsp; She never understood how he had actually gotten the lung cancer since he had never smoked.&nbsp; With only a part of one lung left, they were never sure from one day to the next how long he would actually be around.&nbsp; Asia bent down, kissing her husband on the head.

�She&#8217;ll figure it out, don&#8217;t worry, she always does.�&nbsp; 
�I know she will,� Fred agreed, turning to smile at his wife.

Tyler Sr. and Katherine were having a drink before dinner as Tyler Sr., was trying to calm down his wife.&nbsp; He wasn&#8217;t exactly positive what she was so upset about, but he let her have her anger.&nbsp; 

Katherine Lasko hadn&#8217;t seen a sober day since the morning she found her six-month-old daughter, Lizbeth, still and cold in her crib.&nbsp; An apparent victim of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, Tyler Sr. had tried his best to bring their little girl back, but his efforts had been useless and that was how he continued to feel since that day.&nbsp; 

Since Lizbeth&#8217;s funeral, Tyler Sr. had spent more time at his real estate company, than he did at home.&nbsp; Their son had lived in the basement since he had turned 14, just to stay clear of his mother&#8217;s hurtful words.&nbsp; Tyler Sr. found it easier to give in to both of their demands, rather than trying to make them a family again, feeling like less of a man with every passing day.&nbsp; 

The one thing Tyler Sr. couldn&#8217;t help Katherine with, was their son.&nbsp; He had always had a will of his own and it was definitely stronger than his mother&#8217;s.&nbsp; Tyler Sr. realized a long time ago that it didn&#8217;t pay to argue with either one of them, so he didn&#8217;t.

�I just don&#8217;t see what he sees in her.�&nbsp; 
�What&#8217;s not to see?&nbsp; She&#8217;s beautiful and she&#8217;s polite, well mannered, sexy�� Tyler Sr. was going on.
�Stop it right now!&nbsp; Is that what you see when you look at her?�&nbsp; Katherine asked, glaring at her husband.&nbsp; �I mean, really?�&nbsp; 
�Not at all dear.&nbsp; I see a gold digging little slut that accidentally latched onto our son and now she&#8217;s not gonna let go of him.�&nbsp; 
�That&#8217;s right!&nbsp; That little bitch,� Katherine mumbled, handing Tyler Sr. her glass for a refill.
�Maybe you should eat first dear� sorry, I&#8217;ll get that for you right now.�&nbsp; 

Tyler Sr. took the glass knowing he would have his hands full before the night was over.&nbsp; He changed his drink to club soda, in the hopes that he wouldn&#8217;t need to get physical with her again.&nbsp; There were times when she was so far gone; the only thing he could do was slap her, in order to calm her down.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t like to do it, she knew he hated doing it, but that was where she usually pushed it when she didn&#8217;t drink enough to pass out first.&nbsp; He stood and thought about it a moment, before making her drink a little stronger.&nbsp; He took the drink to his wife, smiling as he handed it to her.

Tyler had been feeling very pleased with his accomplishment and had begun cleaning out his room of Skyler.&nbsp; He felt it wasn&#8217;t necessary any longer, since he had the real thing.&nbsp; After putting the pictures into a bag, Tyler put them in the burn barrel out back, throwing some charcoal lighter fluid onto them before tossing a match into the barrel.&nbsp; He smiled, knowing it was time to go pick his girl up for school.

Skyler had mostly been getting through one day at a time, but barely.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t exactly positive how much longer she could keep it together, but she was doing her best. 
 
As she walked through the halls, a group of kids were standing around talking up ahead.&nbsp; She stopped to listen as they were talking about the mysterious disappearance of David.&nbsp; There were many assumptions going around, but they weren&#8217;t trying to explain away the fact that his car was still there.&nbsp; 

Skyler wasn&#8217;t aware that Tyler was beside her until he was pulling her away from the group of kids.

�Why&#8217;re you listening to that shit?!�&nbsp; 
�I was just going to class and they were all standing there, I don&#8217;t know why I stopped.�&nbsp; 
�I know why,� Tyler growled accusingly.&nbsp; �Your hot numbers were in that little group!�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about!�&nbsp; 
�Yeah, right, listen to your voice, I can hear the lies.�&nbsp; 
�Those aren&#8217;t lies,� Skyler insisted.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m just afraid that you&#8217;re gonna get upset again.�&nbsp; 
�Gee, why would I get upset?�&nbsp; 

Skyler had no idea at first where Tyler was dragging her, but as they began moving down, she was positive she knew where they were headed.&nbsp; 

Tyler knew exactly when the tunnels would be empty and he had his own spot in a very dark corner where he would pull Skyler so she could give him blowjobs.&nbsp; If she could do it without gagging, he would walk her back to class where she would spend the entire hour feeling nauseated, if she couldn&#8217;t do it without gagging, they would stay there until she got it right, getting a slap to the back of the head every time she gagged. 

That day she managed to get it right the first time, plus she kissed and licked his balls, making him extremely happy, so he walked her to class, kissing her at the door.

At the end of the day, when Tyler wasn&#8217;t waiting to take her home, Skyler was almost too frightened to leave without him.&nbsp; She actually waited by her locker for an entire hour, before making the journey home, on foot.&nbsp; 

As she was walking, emergency sirens were suddenly blaring, sending her into a panic as she began to run home, needing to be positive that her family was safe.&nbsp; 

As Skyler ran in the front door, her father and sister were staring at her from the living room.

�What&#8217;s wrong?!�&nbsp; Heather asked as her eyes grew wide.
�Nothing, I just heard the sirens and I wanted to make sure everyone was okay,� Skyler said as she was trying to calm down.&nbsp; �Mom still at work?�&nbsp; 
�Yeah, she&#8217;s bringing home pizza for dinner,� Heather announced with a smile.
�You sure you&#8217;re okay honey?�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m okay daddy, thanks,� Skyler said before walking over to give her father a kiss on the cheek.
�You&#8217;re so weird lately,� Heather pointed out.
�I&#8217;ve just had a lot on my mind, I&#8217;m sorry,� Skyler explained.
�Yeah, well you use to be fun, now you just worry about everything,� She returned before going upstairs.
�You know, I&#8217;m always here if you need to talk.� 
�I know you are daddy, thanks,� Skyler said before going to her room.

As Skyler opened her bedroom door, she let out a small scream after seeing Tyler stretched out on her bed.&nbsp; Stepping back into the hall, she assured her sister that she was fine, before shouting down to her father that her eyes were just playing tricks on her and everything was okay.&nbsp; Heather called her a &#8216;freak&#8217;, before storming back into her own bedroom.&nbsp; 

Skyler entered her bedroom, turning the stereo on so her family wouldn&#8217;t hear them, before locking her door.

�What&#8217;re you doing here Tyler?�&nbsp; 
�Waiting for you.&nbsp; Where were you?�&nbsp; 
�I waited for you at school, but when you didn&#8217;t come for me, I walked home.�&nbsp; 
�Who were you with?�&nbsp; 
�I wasn&#8217;t with anyone, I swear.�&nbsp; 
�Take off your pants and come here.�&nbsp; 
�My dad&#8217;s right below us Tyler!�&nbsp; 
�You arguing with me Skyler?�&nbsp; Tyler asked, propping himself up on one elbow.
�No, I just thought we&#8217;d go to your place,� Skyler stated frantically as he smiled.
�I&#8217;m gonna leave and then I&#8217;m gonna come back and I want you to be ready to come to my place,� Tyler explained, getting off her bed.
�Can we just make it early, please?&nbsp; I just have so much homework to do.�&nbsp; 
�Gee, we&#8217;ve been together every night for how long now?�&nbsp; 
�Almost four months,� Skyler replied, looking at the floor.&nbsp; 
�I really don&#8217;t see you finishing school, d&#8217;you?�&nbsp; He asked, kissing her before letting himself out of the room.

Skyler sat on the edge of the bed as she thought about the fact that he was probably right.&nbsp; She had been pretty sure she was pregnant, but she was trying to put off thinking about it for as long as she possibly could.&nbsp; Now she knew that Tyler knew and she felt even more trapped.&nbsp; Her parents would never understand how she had let it happen.&nbsp; 

She stood up, going into her bathroom to wash her face before changing out of her school clothes and putting on jeans and a sweater.&nbsp; As Skyler looked at herself in the mirror she ran her hand over her stomach.&nbsp; At least she didn&#8217;t have to worry about hiding it yet, she guessed that was one plus to the entire mess.&nbsp; 

Skyler began to wonder what she had done that was so bad that she deserved what was happening to her.&nbsp; She had to stop thinking when she heard the doorbell.&nbsp; 

Tyler had made it outside without anyone, but her even knowing he had been inside.&nbsp; Skyler slowly made her way down the stairs to where Tyler was sitting in the living room, talking to Fred.

�They just had a news bulletin on about somebody else from your school,� Fred announced.
�Somebody other than David?�&nbsp; Skyler asked.&nbsp; �Have they found David yet?�&nbsp; 
�No, it wasn&#8217;t about him.&nbsp; Some girl in your class hung herself in the woods behind her home after school today,� Fred stated, taking a sip of juice.
�What girl?�&nbsp; Skyler asked as Tyler walked around behind her.
�Nichole something or other,� Fred began.&nbsp; �I can&#8217;t remember.�&nbsp; 
�Nichole Freeman?�&nbsp; Skyler asked.
�Yes, that&#8217;s it,� Fred nodded.

Skyler was only able to keep it together for a minute before the room began to spin and go dark.&nbsp; When she opened her eyes, she was lying on Tyler who was sitting on the sofa with her father and Heather staring down at her.&nbsp; Tyler rubbed her cheek gently, trying to wake her. 
 
When Skyler remembered why she had passed out to begin with, she tried getting away from Tyler.&nbsp; He held her firmly, telling her she should rest for a moment.&nbsp; Skyler wanted to get up and run as far away from Tyler as she could possibly get, but she knew that look in his eyes meant she should stay perfectly still, so she did.&nbsp; 

Tyler could feel that Skyler was about to get out of control, asking Fred and Heather, if they could give the two of them a moment.&nbsp; 

Fred and Heather walked into the kitchen, leaving Skyler in tears, as she watched them go through the doorway.

�If you don&#8217;t start cooperating with me, I&#8217;m almost positive that I could get your sister into a car with me,� he informed her, kissing her tears away.&nbsp; �Understand me?�&nbsp; 

Skyler had no choice after that comment and could only nod.&nbsp; 

She knew he had hurt David somehow and she was positive he was responsible for Nikki hanging from a tree.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t take anymore chances, especially with her family.&nbsp; She was going to have to stop looking at, or talking to anyone.&nbsp; She pretty much knew it was all over for her and she just had to let that sink in and accept it. 
 
She had regained some composure by the time her father and sister returned to the living room.&nbsp; They were both surprised to find Skyler, calmly leaning against Tyler.

�You okay?�&nbsp; Fred asked.
�Yeah, I&#8217;m sure it was just the shock of hearing about Nikki,� she explained.
�Maybe you should just get some rest tonight babe,� Tyler suggested.
�I think that&#8217;s a good idea honey,� Fred agreed.&nbsp; �I know you haven&#8217;t been sleeping very well.�&nbsp; 
�Not sleeping?&nbsp; What&#8217;s bothering you?�&nbsp; Tyler asked as Skyler shot him a look and then looked at her lap just as quickly.
�I don&#8217;t know, school and stuff.� 
�Maybe you should get some rest and I&#8217;ll just see you in the morning,� Tyler suggested, before giving her a kiss and saying goodbye to the rest of the family.

Tyler walked out of the house angry again.&nbsp; It was obvious that Skyler had been thinking she would get close to Nikki at some point and she was upset that it couldn&#8217;t happen after she was dead.&nbsp; He knew right then what he needed to do.

Skyler ran up to her bedroom after a small argument about eating supper, once Asia showed up with pizza.&nbsp; She insisted she would be fine if she missed a meal, before leaving her family even more curious about her behavior.&nbsp; 

In her room Skyler began pacing, not a chance she could concentrate on homework right then anyway.&nbsp; It seemed that every time she tried to lay down that afternoon, she would wind up pacing again.&nbsp; It was almost 11 p.m. when she fell asleep due to complete exhaustion. 
 
Skyler&#8217;s sleep was fitful and short-lived when she suddenly felt a hand over her mouth and Tyler&#8217;s weight on top of her as he whispered for her to take off her panties.&nbsp; She struggled underneath him to get them off. 
 
Skyler wondered what had gotten him so excited, since he only had to shove his penis inside before he came.&nbsp; 

Tyler rolled off, pulling her into his arms before he began kissing her.&nbsp; As he began taking his clothes off, Skyler put her hand on top of his.

�What if my parents come in here?�&nbsp; 
�Then we&#8217;ll just tell &#8216;em you&#8217;re pregnant anyway and we&#8217;re getting married.� 
�It&#8217;s not for sure that I&#8217;m pregnant.�&nbsp; 
�You arguing with me Skyler?�&nbsp; 
�No, I&#8217;m sorry, I know you&#8217;re right.&nbsp; Can we at least go on the floor so the bed doesn&#8217;t make noise?�&nbsp; 
�No, I&#8217;m not sleeping on the floor.�&nbsp; 

Skyler was absolutely amazed when Heather hadn&#8217;t even walked down the hall to knock on her bedroom door in the night.&nbsp; Tyler wasn&#8217;t very quiet when he had an orgasm and he liked to say her name, throughout the entire process, telling her he loved her almost every time he said her name.&nbsp; 

When the alarm went off the next morning, Skyler moved quickly, so it wouldn&#8217;t buzz too long, but when she turned back to the bed, Tyler wasn&#8217;t in it.&nbsp; She checked the bathroom, but he wasn&#8217;t there either.&nbsp; Putting her underwear and t-shirt on, she moved quickly out of her room to be sure he hadn&#8217;t killed her family in the night.&nbsp; 

Skyler walked rapidly down to Heather&#8217;s room first, throwing open the door to find Heather very irate as she was pulling her blouse in front of her, yelling at Skyler for not knocking first.&nbsp; Skyler apologized before closing the door. 

She ran downstairs to find her both of her parents in the kitchen.&nbsp; Her father was having coffee while her mother was making breakfast.&nbsp; Fred stared at his daughter with a look of worry on his face.

�You okay honey?�&nbsp; Fred asked.
�Huh?&nbsp; Oh, I think I just had a bad dream or something,� Skyler explained.
�But you&#8217;re okay now?�&nbsp; 
�Yeah, I&#8217;m okay daddy,� Skyler assured him.&nbsp; �I guess I better get moving.�&nbsp; 
�Maybe you should stay home and get some rest honey,� Asia suggested.
�No, that&#8217;s okay,� Skyler insisted as she went back upstairs.

Skyler couldn&#8217;t figure out when Tyler had snuck out of the house since he was still wrapped completely around her 15 minutes before the alarm had gone off.&nbsp; She locked her door and the door that connected to Heather&#8217;s room before taking a shower and getting dressed. 
 
Skyler was just about to eat breakfast when there was a knock at the door.&nbsp; Heather ran to answer it, walking back into the kitchen with Tyler behind her, hands on her shoulders, but he was staring directly at Skyler.&nbsp; She would have to let him know that she already knew her place and he didn&#8217;t need to continue scaring her the way he was.&nbsp; 

Asia invited Tyler to join them for breakfast.&nbsp; Thanking her, he sat next to Skyler, giving her a quick kiss, before saying good morning.&nbsp; Skyler returned his good morning with the best fake smile she could muster.

As Tyler and Skyler entered the school, she resisted any temptation to look up, even though there was another crowd gathered in the hall.&nbsp; Tyler was pleased, giving Skyler a smile and an ass rub.&nbsp; The only time Skyler looked up, was to smile at Tyler, hoping to keep him as happy as possible.&nbsp; 

Tyler was leaning with his back against the other lockers, playing with a strand of Skyler&#8217;s hair, as she gathered together the books she needed for class.&nbsp; Suddenly, she heard a girl&#8217;s voice yelling her name.&nbsp; She never turned to look at Jenny Seraint as she moved closer; instead Skyler hoped she had everything, as she shut the locker, grabbing Tyler by the hand before leading him away from the voice.&nbsp; Tyler stopped her as they got around the corner, wrapping his arms around her.

�Where&#8217;re we going?&nbsp; Your class is the other way.�&nbsp; 
�I just wanted to get away from her.�&nbsp; 
�Didn&#8217;t you ride to the party with her that one night?�&nbsp; 
�I just asked if I could catch a ride and I&#8217;m not even positive it was her,� Skyler tried lying.
�Oh, really?�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t remember, I guess it could&#8217;ve been her, I just don&#8217;t remember.&nbsp; Does it really matter honey?�&nbsp; 

Skyler used the word, honey, to throw him off, even though she almost choked on the word.&nbsp; It worked, making him smile, as he walked her to class the long way around. 

Skyler took the initiative, giving Tyler a kiss, before walking into the classroom, leaving him with a huge smile.&nbsp; As she sat, staring at her desk, Skyler began listening to the buzz around the room and the closer she listened, the sicker she felt.&nbsp; 

At some point the night before, there was another suicide.&nbsp; It seemed that Joshua Kentz had driven down a dirt road and hooked a long hose from the exhaust into his car.&nbsp; He had been found around two o&#8217;clock that morning.&nbsp; 
 
The Kentz family was one of the more prominent families in town, so the police began searching at midnight, after his father reported him missing, but the only reason they found him was because someone had complained about a horn blowing around their house somewhere out of town.&nbsp; 

Joshua had apparently slumped over the steering wheel, unfortunately, not soon enough to be found alive.&nbsp; 

Suddenly Skyler felt an even greater fear for the safety of anyone she had ever spoken to.&nbsp; She felt so ill after her class that she asked Tyler if maybe they could pick up a pregnancy test after school.&nbsp; He insisted they check it at his place and what else could she do, but agree.

It was already the end of February and this was truly the last thing Skyler wanted for a birthday gift.&nbsp; Tyler had to personally supervise the test, right down to holding the stick while she peed on it.&nbsp; 

Tyler&#8217;s birthday was the following week and once they saw the positive, he became extremely excited, swinging her around, telling her it was his best birthday gift ever and he was already planning on when they would get married.&nbsp; Skyler smiled as she gave Tyler a hug and a kiss.&nbsp; She just hoped he would leave people alone after that.&nbsp; 

Two days later, on what Skyler thought was a good day, everything began to unravel.&nbsp; Her happiness began when Tyler called to tell her he wasn&#8217;t going to school that day.&nbsp; She was happy and began thinking that maybe he was losing interest in her enough to let her go.&nbsp; She had actually been thinking that Tyler had changed his mind about wanting to be a father.&nbsp; She was close to her old self that day, actually saying hello to people again.&nbsp; 

Reality sat in as Skyler walked into the house after school.&nbsp; She could see the tension on her parent&#8217;s faces when they asked her to sit down.

�What&#8217;s going on is Heather okay?�&nbsp; 
�Heather&#8217;s fine, she&#8217;s in her room doing her homework,� Asia assured her.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s you we&#8217;re worried about honey, is there anything you wanna tell us?�&nbsp; 
�No, why?�&nbsp; 
�Tyler came to see us today,� Asia informed her.&nbsp; �He said some very disturbing things about you.�&nbsp; 
�Like what?&nbsp; What&#8217;d he say?!�&nbsp; 
�He said that you forced yourself on him and he didn&#8217;t have time to even think about protection.&nbsp; He thought we already knew you were pregnant, but that he wants to marry you and take responsibility for his baby.� 
�You didn&#8217;t believe him, did you?�&nbsp; Skyler asked, standing up.
�We don&#8217;t know what to believe anymore,� Fred stated.&nbsp; �Since Frisbee died, you&#8217;ve been acting very strange honey.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;ve been acting strange because Tyler scares me and I&#8217;ve just been too frightened to tell you!�&nbsp; Skyler blurted without thinking.
�Tyler loves you honey and &#8216;he&#8217; was the one who came to us.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve been so secretive lately while he&#8217;s been open and honest with us and about how much he loves you,� Asia pointed out.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve been so distant and we just don&#8217;t know what to think anymore� does this mean that you aren&#8217;t pregnant?�&nbsp; 
�No, but I&#8217;m still the one telling you the truth!&nbsp; I&#8217;m afraid of Tyler!&nbsp; &#8216;You&#8217; believe me, don&#8217;t you daddy?!�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t know what to believe anymore,� Fred admitted, as Skyler stared blankly at her father.&nbsp; �I wanna believe you honey, but you won&#8217;t talk to anyone anymore.&nbsp; I mean, you and Tyler seem so close.� 
�I don&#8217;t even like boys&#8217; mom!�&nbsp; Skyler shouted, almost hysterically.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m gay!�&nbsp; 
�Enough!�&nbsp; Asia shouted, jumping up.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ve heard enough of this!&nbsp; You did not just say that to me!&nbsp; No daughter of mine is a lesbian and you will marry Tyler!&nbsp; Now go to your room, I can&#8217;t stand looking at you right now!&nbsp; We&#8217;re finished discussing this!�&nbsp; 

Skyler had been dismissed and ran crying to her room.&nbsp; She felt completely alone at that moment.&nbsp; There was absolutely nobody she could turn to if her own family wouldn&#8217;t even take her side.&nbsp; 

Tyler would be 19 in three more days and she would be 19 in another month and it was going to be the worst birthday of her life, she would be married to a crazy man and who knows what he would do to her when she actually was his. 
 
She would have killed herself in that moment, but she couldn&#8217;t think about anything but the baby inside her.&nbsp; She cried until she could cry no more.&nbsp; There was absolutely nothing she could do but marry him and deal with whatever he wanted to do to her.&nbsp; It would be the only way to keep her family safe.&nbsp; 

Tyler was walking into his parents&#8217; house around the same time Skyler was being confronted by her parents.&nbsp; As he walked through the front door, his mother had a drink in her hand.&nbsp; Tyler stormed over, grabbing it from her, spilling some as he took it to dump down the sink.

�Tyler, give mommy back her drink,� Katherine instructed.
�Don&#8217;t talk to me like I&#8217;m a fucking baby!&nbsp; When&#8217;s dad getting home?�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t know baby, what time is it?�&nbsp; 
�Three-thirty.&nbsp; You&#8217;d know that if you&#8217;d lay off the booze.�&nbsp; 
�I just miss your sister so much, but you know I love you, don&#8217;t you baby?� 
�I told you to stop talking to me like that!&nbsp; Lizbeth&#8217;s been dead for 12 years now, get over it already.�&nbsp; 
�You don&#8217;t get to talk to me like that!&nbsp; You ungrateful little bastard!&nbsp; You have no idea what it&#8217;s like to be a parent yet, but you will someday!�&nbsp; She shouted as she cried.
�Someday soon,� Tyler announced.&nbsp; Skyler and I are getting married before she has the baby.�&nbsp; 
�You wanna marry that slut?!�&nbsp; 
�You&#8217;re more of a fucking slut than she is!�&nbsp; 
�Don&#8217;t talk to me that way, I&#8217;m your mother!�&nbsp; 
�You haven&#8217;t been a mother to me since before you lost her!�&nbsp; 
�Don&#8217;t say that baby, you know I love you, you&#8217;re my baby boy,� Katherine cried as she staggered over to Tyler trying to hug his head to her chest.
�You don&#8217;t know what love is!�&nbsp; He shouted, holding her away from him.&nbsp; �The only one you loved was her!&nbsp; You haven&#8217;t loved me since before she was born, so don&#8217;t even try feeding me your bullshit!&nbsp; Two more drinks and you&#8217;ll be wishing I was dead instead of her, just like you do all the damn time, so don&#8217;t even fucking touch me!�&nbsp; 


Tyler had lost his patience the moment his mother had called Skyler a slut.&nbsp; He knew for a fact that he was her first and for his mother to question the virtue of the girl he had been in love with for so many years was unacceptable.&nbsp; 

Grabbing his mother by the wrists, he pushed her back to the chair she had gotten out of.&nbsp; He seriously thought about hitting her just before his father walked through the front door. 
 
As Tyler Sr., walked into the house and saw Tyler standing over his mother, he just stared at the two of them.

�What&#8217;s going on son?�&nbsp; Tyler Sr. asked.
�She&#8217;s drunk and I was trying to tell her that Skyler&#8217;s pregnant and we&#8217;re getting married.�&nbsp; 
�Well, I guess I could think of worse women to be stuck with,� he admitted, staring at his close to unconscious wife.&nbsp; �You moving in downstairs?�&nbsp; 
�No, I wanna take her away from here.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want her mother popping in all the time and mom can&#8217;t stand her, so I wanna take her away from everyone.� 
�Well, just tell me what you need and I&#8217;ll take care of it.&nbsp; If you have trouble after you leave, just call or write me at work and I&#8217;ll take care of everything.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think we could trust your mother to give me your letters and besides that, what she doesn&#8217;t know won&#8217;t hurt her, right?�&nbsp; 

Tyler Sr. smiled as he asked his son the question, knowing perfectly well that Katherine wouldn&#8217;t remember their conversation the following morning.

Smiling at his father, Tyler knew he wouldn&#8217;t need to worry about money at all.&nbsp; His father had always felt guilty about the fact that Katherine had stopped being a mother to Tyler after his sister died.&nbsp; 

Katherine thought she was a mother, but it was never her, it was always his father who had bent over backwards to please his son in the hopes that he wouldn&#8217;t realize that his mother had vanished in one swift move.&nbsp; 

Tyler didn&#8217;t feel one way or the other about the entire thing.&nbsp; He knew his mother had stopped caring about him as soon as she knew she was having a girl.&nbsp; As long as things turned out the way he wanted them to turn out, he was fine.&nbsp; 

He didn&#8217;t care about his parents, but he pretended he did with his dad, so he wouldn&#8217;t cut him off.&nbsp; Tyler knew that his father&#8217;s guilt would keep him supplied with whatever he wanted and the only thing he wanted was Skyler.

The night before Tyler and Skyler were to be married, Jenny Seraint was walking home along her usual route, after her shift at the grocery store.&nbsp; As she began walking down the alley, to her house, Tyler drove up beside her.

�Hey Jenny,� Tyler smiled, rolling down the window.
�Oh, hi Tyler.&nbsp; Where&#8217;s Sky?�&nbsp; 
�She&#8217;s getting some rest tonight cuz we&#8217;re getting married tomorrow.�&nbsp; 
�Married?&nbsp; I thought she wanted to go to college?�&nbsp; 
�Yeah, well things kinda changed after she got pregnant.�&nbsp; 
�So you&#8217;re happy about it then?�&nbsp; 
�Yeah, but I was actually just coming to ask you a favor.�&nbsp; 
�What sorta favor?�&nbsp; 
�Well, I know you guys hang out once in a while and I thought maybe you could help me pick out a gift to give her tomorrow.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just no good at gifts,� he explained.&nbsp; �I mean if it&#8217;s not too much trouble?�&nbsp; 
�I guess I could.&nbsp; We haven&#8217;t talked in a while, but the jewelry store closes in 15 minutes, can we make it in time?�&nbsp; 
�I think we should be able to,� Tyler assured her with one of his famous smiles.

Jenny ran around to the passenger seat, while Tyler looked ahead and behind them.&nbsp; As soon as she was inside, Tyler reached over, pulling her down onto the seat, holding his hand over her mouth and nose, as she struggled in vain to get loose.&nbsp; The moment he saw her moving her hands to get hold of his arms, he grabbed them with his other hand until she was unconscious.&nbsp; Removing his hand from her face, she began breathing normally, as he drove away.&nbsp; 

Tyler drove, brushing Jenny&#8217;s hair away from her face.&nbsp; He traveled down a dirt road to a spot where there was swamp between the lake and the road.&nbsp; 

He needed to carry Jenny, since she was still out cold, but he managed easily, putting her into the water face first.&nbsp; He stood there, lighting a cigarette, waiting to see if she would come to, but she never did.&nbsp; 

Tyler smiled, knowing that once he took Skyler away, nobody would ever be able to get between them again.&nbsp; He smiled as he waved at Jenny&#8217;s lifeless body, before getting back into his car.&nbsp; It was time to pick up his fianc�, not seeing a problem with her spending the night at his place, since they would be married soon.&nbsp; 

He drove off, feeling content that he had taken care of everyone he needed to worry about coming between him and Skyler and he couldn&#8217;t help but smile again.

Chapter 3

It was a beautiful Saturday morning as the sun reflected brightly off the light snow that had fallen the night before.&nbsp; Skyler and Tyler stood in front of the Justice of the Peace with her parents and sister on one side while his parents were on the other.&nbsp; Both mothers were crying, but for completely different reasons.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 
Tyler&#8217;s father looked at Skyler as though she was the luckiest girl in the world.&nbsp; She had no idea how he had fooled so many people for so long?&nbsp; Skyler seemed to be the only one who knew he wasn&#8217;t what he appeared to be, if only she had seen it before she had ever gotten involved with him. 

After the ceremony and once all legal documents had been signed, Skyler stood next to Tyler just inside the doors as her family walked past them, barely giving her a glance as they hurried out towards their car.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t believe how cold they had become overnight; actually she couldn&#8217;t believe anything that had happened since the school year had begun.&nbsp; 

Tyler Sr. made his way to Skyler, giving her a huge hug before shaking Tyler&#8217;s hand in congratulations.&nbsp; Skyler smiled at Tyler&#8217;s father, trying not to pay attention to Katherine, as she clung to Tyler, warning him of the horrible mistake she was positive he had made.&nbsp; Tyler Sr. was eventually forced to peel her off their son, pushing her towards the car as Tyler took hold of Skyler&#8217;s hand, leading her to his vehicle. 
 
The closer they were getting to the auto, the tighter Tyler&#8217;s grip was getting on Skyler&#8217;s hand.

�Tyler, you&#8217;re hurting me,� Skyler cried, trying to pull her hand away.
�Did you like that hug my dad gave you?�&nbsp; He sneered.&nbsp; �You sure had a nice fucking smile for him.� 
�No!&nbsp; I was just trying to be nice; he seems like a nice man.�&nbsp; 
�But I&#8217;m not, right?�&nbsp; 
�I never said that!&nbsp; I love you Tyler,� Skyler stated when she actually felt like saying, &#8216;duh&#8217; to him.
�We&#8217;ll see pretty soon how much you love me,� Tyler said, firmly pushing her into the car.
�I&#8217;m sorry; I just thought that they were my family now too.�&nbsp; 
�Yeah, but I didn&#8217;t see you hugging &#8216;your&#8217; father.�&nbsp; 
�Only because he hates me now.�&nbsp; 
�Well that works then, because the only one you have anymore is me and the sooner you understand that the better off you&#8217;ll be.�&nbsp; 
�You&#8217;re all I need,� Skyler said, deciding she should at least try and make her life easier as Tyler smiled at her.

Fred, Asia and Heather had been moving along the highway towards home when Fred glanced at his wife behind the driver&#8217;s wheel.

�She didn&#8217;t look very happy,� he remarked.
�She&#8217;ll be fine,� Asia stated.
�She actually looked a little frightened,� Fred noted. 
�Stop seeing things that aren&#8217;t there,� Asia snapped.
�I don&#8217;t think he is mom, I think I noticed it too,� Heather agreed.
�She&#8217;ll be fine; now both of you just let it go,� Asia insisted.&nbsp; 

Due to the stress on the ride home, the three of them couldn&#8217;t get to the aspirin fast enough once they reached the house.&nbsp; 

Tyler Sr. pushed Katherine into the passenger seat of the car before walking around to the driver&#8217;s side.&nbsp; As he got inside, he glanced at his wife feeling completely frustrated with her, not even knowing which way to turn anymore.&nbsp; All he could do was grind his teeth as she began to cry.&nbsp; 

�I just lost my baby boy.�&nbsp; 
�You lost him the day Lizbeth died and you know it.�&nbsp; 
�You don&#8217;t know anything about it!�&nbsp; 
�I know more than you think I know!&nbsp; I also know he wanted to be downstairs so that he wouldn&#8217;t have to listen to you wish he had been the one that died instead of his sister!� 
�I never said that!�&nbsp; 
�You did when you were drunk enough!�&nbsp; Tyler shouted accusingly.&nbsp; �Maybe if you had actually been a mother to him instead of a burden, he wouldn&#8217;t be moving so far away!�&nbsp; 
�Moving?�&nbsp; Katherine inquired.&nbsp; �He never told me he was moving away.�&nbsp; 
�He hasn&#8217;t told you anything in years and by shutting you out, he shut me out too and now it&#8217;s over and it&#8217;s too late to try and have any kind of a relationship with him, so deal with that!�&nbsp; 
�You dirty rotten bastard!�&nbsp; 

Tyler Sr. had been pushed too far in that moment as he reached over, slapping Katherine, lightly across the mouth with the back of his hand.&nbsp; She began to cry at first, but as soon as he raised his hand again, she quieted down, staring out the window as she whimpered.&nbsp; No more was said on the ride home as Tyler Sr., felt sickened by his own actions.

In Tyler&#8217;s mind, the moment Skyler signed the wedding papers, she had handed herself over to him.&nbsp; This meant she was his to do with as he pleased, she was his property, it was perfectly clear in his mind and as soon as they entered the honeymoon suite, Tyler gave his new wife a very passionate kiss before hitting her so hard across the face that it knocked her to the floor.&nbsp; 

Skyler scrambled towards the corner as Tyler moved to pick her off the floor, splitting her lip open as he called her a slut.&nbsp; Skyler had no idea where the accusation was headed, until Tyler ripped her dress off, shredding her panties and nylons before crawling onto her as he held Skyler by the throat.&nbsp; She struggled, but to no avail, as Tyler had gotten so turned on that he roughly shoved his cock into her, laughing as she gasped for oxygen, not letting go until her eyes began to flutter and the fight had gone out of her.&nbsp; Skyler lay perfectly still, other than gasping for air until Tyler orgasmed and got off her.&nbsp; Curling into a ball, she lay crying as Tyler fastened his pants before leaving the room.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 
When Tyler had returned to the room, he laid down the package in his hand before going to Skyler.&nbsp; She hadn&#8217;t moved from the spot on the bed and once his clothes were removed, he crawled behind her, warning her against making him so angry.&nbsp; The only thing she could do was apologize while promising to try harder.&nbsp; 

To satiate Tyler during the remainder of their honeymoon, Skyler began offering herself to him on a regular basis.&nbsp; She knew he craved her almost continuously, so she tried to keep him happy, mostly by taking the initiative to give him several blowjobs a day.&nbsp; She would always crawl towards him with the best smile she could muster, giving a small growl, before kissing his balls and the glans of his cock, ultimately swirling her tongue about the meatus as she attempted to take the entire nine-or-so inches of him into her mouth.&nbsp; Tyler wouldn&#8217;t even slap her across the head when she gagged, if she had volunteered.

Tyler thought it was an extremely successful honeymoon as he handed Skyler the &#8216;gift&#8217; he had picked up for her.&nbsp; Skyler cringed internally when she removed the turtleneck from the bag, but she smiled as she kissed Tyler, thanking him for being so thoughtful.&nbsp; She was already tired and it had only been two days, but she would need to do whatever she could to hold onto her sanity.

By Monday morning Skyler was allowed to return home and pack up her clothes while Tyler waited in the car.&nbsp; She was on a time limit, but since her family had stopped talking to her, she didn&#8217;t see that as being a major problem.&nbsp; She was throwing her things into a suitcase as her mother walked into the room.

�I thought you didn&#8217;t like turtlenecks?�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t,� Skyler answered, her voice quivering.&nbsp; �Tyler made me wear it.�&nbsp; 
�Made you?�&nbsp; Asia asked, doubtfully.
�Yes mother!�&nbsp; Skyler turned around exposing her new black eye and fat lip, pulling down the collar to reveal the finger marks on her neck.&nbsp; �Does this make you happy?&nbsp; The big lesbian is getting what she deserves!�&nbsp; 
�What the hell did he do that for?!&nbsp; Did you tell him you were a lesbian?&nbsp; Is that why he hurt you?!�&nbsp; Asia asked, cringing at the cuts and bruises on her first born.&nbsp; 
�That&#8217;s what he does mom; he&#8217;s always known I was a lesbian, that&#8217;s how I got into this mess!&nbsp; He doesn&#8217;t care as long as he can possess me.&nbsp; I have to go I&#8217;m almost out of time,� Skyler insisted, zipping the suitcase closed.
�No!&nbsp; Don&#8217;t go, stay here,� Asia insisted, turning her daughter around.&nbsp; �Let&#8217;s straighten this out.�&nbsp; 
�It&#8217;s already done mom!&nbsp; I just want you to know that the only one I blame for any of this is me.&nbsp; I walked right into it and by the time I really saw what he was, it was too late.&nbsp; I have to go; I don&#8217;t wanna make him angry.&nbsp; I love you, daddy and Heather, please tell them that,� Skyler said, pulling her suitcase off the bed.
�Sky, don&#8217;t go like this!�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t have a choice!&nbsp; Don&#8217;t you understand?!&nbsp; I have to go!�&nbsp; 

Skyler froze as soon as she had gotten halfway down the steps.

�I&#8217;ll get that for you hon, don&#8217;t want you hurting our baby,� Tyler offered from just inside the front door.&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t worry Asia; I&#8217;ll give her everything she deserves.�&nbsp; 

Asia didn&#8217;t know which way to turn as she stared at Tyler, asking herself if maybe she should have listened to her daughter instead of being so worried about Skyler&#8217;s sexuality.&nbsp; She was afraid to say anything more to him, in case Skyler had been telling the truth.&nbsp; Asia was left staring at the door as it closed, absolutely no idea where they were going or if she would ever see her daughter again.&nbsp; Sitting down on the step, Asia began to cry.&nbsp; 

As Heather was heading down the stairs, Asia was still on the step crying.

�What&#8217;s wrong mom?�&nbsp; 
�I think I was wrong about Sky,� Asia admitted.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t think Tyler has her best interests at heart.�&nbsp; 
�Tyler was wonderful to her; he was always nice; wasn&#8217;t he?�&nbsp; 
�I think he let us see what he wanted us to see.&nbsp; You didn&#8217;t see her just now when she left, she had a fat lip, a black eye and it looked as though he had been choking her.�&nbsp; 
�If that were true, why would she stay with him?�&nbsp; 
�She said he scared her and she was afraid of him,� Asia said with a feeling of helplessness.&nbsp; �I think she may have been telling the truth.�&nbsp; 

As she finished talking, she watched Fred walk out of the bedroom and into the kitchen; eventually hearing the back door open and close. 
 
Heather, not knowing what to do for her mother, returned to her room.&nbsp; Lying on her bed, she began staring at a picture of her and Skyler from several years earlier.&nbsp; They had been cleaning up the leaves in the backyard when Skyler gave her a shove, knocking her into the pile.&nbsp; Their father had snapped the picture as they wrestled and laughed.&nbsp; It had always been Heather&#8217;s favorite picture of them together. 
 
Asia began crying again as she went into the kitchen to start lunch.

Once Tyler put the suitcase into the car, Skyler stood in front of him, standing up to him one of the few times she would dare.

�I&#8217;m telling you right now that if you ever lay a hand on our baby, you might as well just kill me because nothing else&#8217;ll matter.�&nbsp; 
�Then I guess you better behave so I don&#8217;t have to.&nbsp; I can keep you alive, doesn&#8217;t mean you have to be happy about it, so any kids we have, it&#8217;s up to you if they get hurt or not.�&nbsp; 

Chapter 4

Skyler felt sick as she crawled into the car.&nbsp; She had no idea where Tyler was taking her, but it didn&#8217;t really matter, as long as it was somewhere far enough away so she wouldn&#8217;t need to worry about her family constantly.&nbsp; 

She had absolutely no doubt that she would never see any of her family again and she was trying hard to accept, that from this point on, the only one she would ever have around to talk to again, would be Tyler; he would be her life.

Where they wound up, was Minneapolis in an apartment building that looked as though it was begging to be condemned.&nbsp; 

As Tyler carried the suitcases up to the second floor, Skyler held his arm the entire way, not because she wanted to, but because she was more afraid of the neighborhood than she was of him.&nbsp; 

He sat down the suitcases to unlock the door and left them sit outside the apartment as he carried Skyler over the threshold. 
 
Once they were actually inside, Tyler was completely sickened by the looks of the place.&nbsp; He walked into the bedroom, taking the cell phone out of his pocket, but he had a smile on his face when he walked back out, telling Skyler they wouldn&#8217;t be staying in the apartment for very long.&nbsp; Tyler explained that the place would still need to be cleaned up while they had to stay there, so they would need to do some shopping and pick up a few things to tide them over. 
 
Tyler asked Skyler what types of foods she enjoyed cooking, not making him very happy when he discovered that Skyler had no clue how to cook, never even having made a piece of toast for herself. 
 
Looking out the living room window, Tyler noticed a grocery store on the corner across the street, so before they even walked out the door, he warned Skyler about behaving while they were shopping.&nbsp; 

Skyler stood next to him the entire time, not daring to look at anybody or anything while he glanced through cookbooks to see which one had meals in it he might like.
&nbsp; 
Once they had picked up some groceries, cleaning supplies and a couple of bug bombs, they went back to the apartment.
&nbsp; 
He actually took her out for food while the bug bombs were working and she listened as Tyler spoke about their future together and how happy he would make her once she settled into a routine.&nbsp; 

Tyler explained to her how he wanted at least five sons, but no daughters.&nbsp; He explained how he wanted to get her a beautiful house with new furniture.&nbsp; Skyler smiled as he spoke, but she didn&#8217;t believe a word of it.&nbsp; He had the ability to convince everyone, including himself into believing his lies, but Skyler was beyond trusting anything he said, even though she pretended she did.&nbsp; 

Back at the apartment, Tyler pitched in to help with the cleaning and Skyler was extremely grateful for the assistance.&nbsp; Tyler was actually too tired for sex that night and she was able to sleep for the first time in months because she was so exhausted, but by the following morning, the vacation was over and he was back to his old self.
&nbsp; 
Skyler had begun adjusting to the way he clung to her when they slept. It was almost as though he feared waking up and not feeling her in his arms.&nbsp; Once he had adjusted her, she never dared move.&nbsp; 
 
When he eventually let her out of bed, Skyler made the mistake of opening the living room curtains and Tyler sent her flying as he punched her alongside the head.

�Don&#8217;t you ever open a curtain and look out a window again!�&nbsp; 
�I just wanted to let some light into the apartment.�&nbsp; 
�I know exactly what you were doing!&nbsp; You think that because we live in the Cities now you&#8217;re gonna be running wild, but you&#8217;re not!�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t!&nbsp; It&#8217;s just so dark in here,� Skyler argued as Tyler quickly picked her up just so he could knock her down again.
�Quit fucking arguing with me!&nbsp; What&#8217;d I say?!�&nbsp; 
�Don&#8217;t look out the window, don&#8217;t touch the curtains,� Skyler cried.
�Good, now get out there and make me some fucking breakfast!�&nbsp; 
�I, I don&#8217;t know what to do,� Skyler said, covering her face.
�Okay, I&#8217;m gonna show you this once, but you better pay close fucking attention,� Tyler stated, picking her up off the floor by the arm.

Tyler led her to the kitchen, digging around for two frying pans as he showed her how to make bacon, eggs and toast after telling her to stop crying.&nbsp; Skyler realized by the amount of food he was putting in the pans that she wasn&#8217;t getting any.&nbsp; As that was frying, he showed her how to make coffee.&nbsp; When everything was finished, Tyler put it all onto a plate before sitting at the table.

�Do I get to eat?�&nbsp; 
�You can have two pieces of toast with a little butter on it.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want you to wind up looking like your mother.�&nbsp; 

Skyler turned to make her toast, even though she just wanted to hit Tyler in the head at that moment.&nbsp; 

She was used to big breakfasts at home.&nbsp; Her mother always made sure that she and Heather had a good breakfast before they went to school. 
 
Skyler made her toast before walking to the table.

�Can I sit with you?�&nbsp; 
�Just sit and don&#8217;t be stupid.�&nbsp; 
�Can I have coffee with milk?&nbsp; Or is that too fattening?�&nbsp; 
�You trying to piss me off?�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m just trying to find out what the rules are, so I don&#8217;t step outta line.�&nbsp; 
�Good idea,� Tyler agreed, not noticing the sarcasm in Skyler&#8217;s voice.&nbsp; �That way if you do something you shouldn&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll know you&#8217;re trying to piss me off.�&nbsp; 
�Would it really matter Tyler?&nbsp; I seem to piss you off no matter what I do, so does it really matter?�&nbsp; 
�Maybe that just means you should try harder.�&nbsp; 
�So then, is this toast the only food I get all day, or can I have crackers or something for dinner?�&nbsp; 
�Now you&#8217;re just getting a smartass attitude; you really think you can keep up with a good beating?�&nbsp; 
�Probably not� so what&#8217;re the rules?�&nbsp; Skyler asked, suddenly losing her appetite.
�Simple rules, if you take care of me and my needs and you&#8217;ll be fine.�&nbsp; 
�So basically, as long as I let you slap me around and let you fuck me four times a day, everything&#8217;ll be okay?�&nbsp; 
�Okay, I&#8217;m gonna give you a freebie because of where we&#8217;re living, but the main rule is to not be giving me any lip!�&nbsp; His voice had gotten louder near the end.&nbsp; �Want more?&nbsp; How about this one, when I watch television, you sit on the bed.�&nbsp; 
�Why can&#8217;t I watch TV?�&nbsp; 
�Because I don&#8217;t want you to, no radio either.&nbsp; You cook and clean and stay away from the windows and if I take you outside, keep your head down and ignore anyone that talks to you.&nbsp; When we sleep, no pajamas and if I tell you to do something, don&#8217;t give me any attitude, just do it.&nbsp; I guess we&#8217;ll play the rest by ear.&nbsp; You&#8217;re my wife now and just remember that til death do us part, means exactly that,� Tyler explained as he finished eating and got up from the table.
�The least you could do is put your dishes in the sink.�&nbsp; 

Skyler got up from the table, backing away from Tyler as he moved rapidly back to where she wound up huddled in the corner.&nbsp; Once she ran out of space, Skyler sat down, putting her hands over her head as she began to apologize.&nbsp; Tyler gave her one good kick in the upper portion of her leg, causing her to cry out in pain before he pulled her up by the hair, throwing her face first onto the table and tearing off her panties before fucking her roughly in the ass. 
 
As she began to scream from the pain, Tyler clamped his hand over her mouth before slamming her head against the table to let her know who was in charge.&nbsp; When he had finished with her, he pulled her up by the hair, looking her in the eyes as she cried.

�D&#8217;you get it now?�&nbsp; Tyler asked as Skyler nodded, tears sliding down her cheeks.&nbsp; �Good, now clean up this fucking mess, I&#8217;m going to shower,� he said, throwing her onto the floor.

Skyler looked at the drops of blood on the floor, wincing from the pain as she tried standing up.&nbsp; He had gotten so rough with her that he made her bleed and that was when she decided it might be best to cooperate as best she could without challenging him so much.&nbsp; Shakily she began cleaning the blood on her ass and on the kitchen floor.

There was at least twice a day when Skyler had time to herself.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t allowed to do anything other than sit on the bed, but at least she was left alone.&nbsp; Normally she would look through the cookbook, which made Tyler smile to think that Skyler was actually trying to please him because she was falling in love.&nbsp; Other times she would lie down, falling asleep as she was quietly talking to the baby and rubbing her stomach.&nbsp; 

Tyler enjoyed watching the news twice a day and when he called her out of the bedroom after four days of the routine, Skyler moved rapidly to Tyler&#8217;s side where he let her watch the broadcast about Jenny Seraint.&nbsp; The story mostly spoke about Jenny and how she was the second person in town to disappear without a trace.&nbsp; Skyler put her head down as she began to cry and silently apologize to Jenny.

�Why&#8217;re you crying?&nbsp; She&#8217;s just missing, maybe she just ran off or something.�&nbsp; 
�Maybe,� Skyler agreed shakily, knowing Tyler was lying.
�Then stop your fucking crying!�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m sorry; did you want me to go away again?�&nbsp; 
�Might as well, you&#8217;re just pissing me off now.�&nbsp; 

As the months went by and Skyler began looking pregnant, Tyler stopped letting her go with him to get groceries for fear people would begin talking to her about the baby.&nbsp; During the time he was gone, she would stay in her spot on the bed until he returned.&nbsp; 

Even though he knew in the back of his mind that she wasn&#8217;t doing anything wrong, there was a nagging doubt that always hung there and that doubt would always cause him to call her a liar before slapping her and either raping her or forcing her to give him a blowjob as proof of her loving him.
&nbsp; 
Skyler had begun to realize that it wouldn&#8217;t matter what she would ever tell him, he would always find a reason to slap her at least once a day and that was just the way it was.

As time went by, Skyler began having a few questions of her own, but unfortunately she was too afraid to ask them.&nbsp; She was very curious how he always had money in his pockets and they never seemed to go without the things that Tyler wanted, but she would never dare to ask him for fear of what he might do to her.

The day Skyler had gone into labor, had been the day after a particularly nasty beating.&nbsp; Unfortunately she hadn&#8217;t been feeling very well the day before and had burned Tyler&#8217;s dinner.&nbsp; This had pissed him off so much, that by the time he was finished with her, Skyler had a fat lip, a bruised cheek, along with bruises on her neck and body. 
 
When her water broke the following day, Tyler made it clear that if anyone suspected him of anything, he would be paying her family a little visit.&nbsp; After calling for an ambulance, he vanished before it arrived.&nbsp; 

As Skyler was wheeled into the hospital, the nurse asked if she had been beaten, but Skyler lied, telling the nurse she had been on a flight of stairs when her water broke and had slipped.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t positive the nurse believed her, but the subject never came up again, so at least there was one less thing to worry about. 
 
Skyler was alone and scared to death, not having any idea what to expect.&nbsp; She and her mother had never discussed having children since Skyler hadn&#8217;t actually thought it was necessary, but suddenly she was wishing she would have paid closer attention the day Heather was born. 
 
Before three hours had passed, a healthy, crying, Hunter Isaiah was born and for the first time in a long time, Skyler had hope again.
&nbsp; 
Tyler walked in while Skyler was in the middle of breastfeeding and she actually smiled at him as he walked into the room, but it didn&#8217;t last.

�What&#8217;re you doing?�&nbsp; 
�Feeding the baby.�&nbsp; 
�You need to get him a bottle or something.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the last time I wanna see that,� he warned her as he turned and walked back out.&nbsp; 

Skyler&#8217;s smile was gone as she pushed the buzzer to let the nurses know that she wouldn&#8217;t be breast feeding after all.&nbsp; Hunter had a bottle for his next feeding.&nbsp; 

Tyler arrived at the hospital in time to pick up Skyler and Hunter, telling her he had a surprise for her.&nbsp; He took them to an actual house, claiming he had bought it for her and the boy even though, in the baby&#8217;s room, the only thing besides diapers and baby clothes, obviously sent by his father, was a mattress. 

It was a two bedroom house and it was in a much nicer neighborhood than the apartment they had been in.&nbsp; Most of the house had brand new furniture; the only room that was sparsely furnished was the baby&#8217;s room.
&nbsp; 
Skyler was disgusted with Tyler so much on that day that she almost spat in his face, but common sense returned to her in time.

�There&#8217;s no crib.�&nbsp; 
�Do I fucking look stupid?&nbsp; I know there&#8217;s no crib.&nbsp; He&#8217;s got a mattress, so just put the damned sheet on it, it&#8217;s not like he&#8217;s gonna get up and walk out of it!� 
�But he will at some point, can&#8217;t we at least get a gate to put up?�&nbsp; 
�I guess, if it means that much to you,� Tyler conceded.&nbsp; �So, you should go make that up and let him, Hunter, right?�&nbsp; 
�Yeah, Hunter Isaiah, I&#8217;ve always loved that name.�&nbsp; 
�Yeah, I&#8217;m sure, just go put him down now,� Tyler ordered before walking out of the room.

Skyler was completely confused, but she did as she was told.&nbsp; She put the fitted sheet on half of the mattress before putting Hunter down on it and smiled at him, knowing from that moment on this little boy would be her only reason for being. 
 
It took Skyler some effort to stand, since her muscles were still fairly tender and moving slowly around the house, she headed out to find Tyler.&nbsp; With the curtains all closed, the house was fairly dark, but from what she could see, the furniture looked new and there was comfortable, new carpeting throughout the place.&nbsp; That would be nice when Hunter began crawling and learning to walk. 
 
The two bedrooms stood at opposite ends of the hall and they were fairly large, the bathroom was in-between the bedrooms while the hallway opened into the living room.&nbsp; Straight through the living room was the kitchen and once she had seen Tyler&#8217;s shadow; she walked towards him where he was pacing as he waited for her. 
 
Skyler could see he was upset, but she moved closer to him despite her fear.&nbsp; Tyler back-handed her across the face the moment he turned around, sending her immediately to the floor.&nbsp; Skyler stared up at Tyler, her hand on her face as he began moving towards her.&nbsp; She attempted to scramble away from him, but suddenly he was on top of her, asking how she could hurt him that way as he began slapping her across the face. 
 
As she continued asking him what she had done, Skyler began promising she would never do it again if only he would tell her what it was.&nbsp; When he began ripping her clothes off, she tried to tell him they weren&#8217;t supposed to have sex until her stitches healed, but it didn&#8217;t stop him and that was the first time Tyler actually held Skyler&#8217;s throat until she lost consciousness.
&nbsp; 
Tyler never did tell Skyler why he was so angry, but after she changed Hunter&#8217;s diaper and fed him, Tyler did help her clean herself up, warning her the entire time about making him so angry.&nbsp; All she could do the entire time was apologize and promise to try harder.

Chapter 5

Neither Skyler nor Hunter was allowed out of the house once the boy had been taken home.&nbsp; Tyler did all of the grocery shopping and insisted Hunter needed no toys.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t want the boy making any noise around the house, so Skyler kept him in his room as much as possible, staying in the room with him when Tyler would allow it.

There were times when Tyler was actually good to Skyler and she tried holding onto those moments.&nbsp; He would rent movies on occasion and let her watch them with him, even letting Hunter sit with them at times.&nbsp; He was always such a good little boy, sitting quietly as he leaned into his mother.&nbsp; 

Tyler began letting Skyler eat a meal with him every other night once Hunter was born.&nbsp; The doctor had made some mention about how thin Skyler was, giving Tyler a few looks he didn&#8217;t like, so to avoid any health problems, he allowed her to eat a few meals with him every week.&nbsp; Most of the time, Skyler didn&#8217;t mind eating with Tyler, especially when he would talk to her about something he had seen on the news, or something he had seen while he was out shopping; there were even times they would laugh about things together, but it never seemed to last. 

One day Tyler walked into the house with a baby gate, acting as though he had done something great.&nbsp; Skyler made the mistake of rolling her eyes since she had asked him for one the day they first brought Hunter home.&nbsp; Before putting it up, she gave Hunter some cereal to eat while he was in his room.&nbsp; She kept a baggie of it on his closet shelf since he spent so much time in there. 
 
As she walked out of the bedroom, Tyler was leaning against the doorjamb to the living room with his arms folded; she could see by the look on his face that he wasn&#8217;t happy.

�What&#8217;s wrong?�&nbsp; Skyler asked seconds before her head was being bounced off the wall.&nbsp; �What?!�&nbsp; 
�You still wanna roll your fucking eyes at me?�&nbsp; Tyler asked, smashing her head into the wall again.
�I&#8217;m sorry!&nbsp; Just stop already, please?!�&nbsp; Skyler begged as Tyler pulled her towards the bedroom.

He was pulling her down the hallway while Skyler was telling Hunter to eat his cereal as calmly as she could when he began crying for her. 
 
Tyler threw her onto the bed, face first, telling her to stay put when she began to move.&nbsp; As soon as he had her partially stripped, he took his own pants off, crawling on top of her, fucking her in the ass while pushing her face into the bed.&nbsp; Skyler struggled to get his hand off her head so she could breathe, but there was just no way to fight him off.&nbsp; 

When she was about to pass out, Tyler pulled her head up, letting her breathe for a few seconds, before pushing her back down.&nbsp; When he eventually got off of her, he explained that if he ever saw her roll her eyes at him again, he wouldn&#8217;t let her come up for a breath.&nbsp; Once his pants were zipped again, before walking out of the bedroom, he informed Skyler that Jenny had been found face down in a swamp just outside of their hometown.&nbsp; 

Skyler dressed once Tyler had gone out of the room, going into the baby&#8217;s room to lie down with Hunter while she cried for Jenny.

Tyler had invented two new sex games for Skyler around that time.&nbsp; She assumed it was some sort of a test when he would rip her panties off as she was doing dishes and begin fucking her from behind.&nbsp; The test part seemed to be in the fact that he would always wait until she was washing his steak knife.&nbsp; She had actually considered using it on him for a split second the first time, but Hunter&#8217;s face popped into her head, making her drop the knife into the sink.
&nbsp; 
This always seemed to excite Tyler even more and Skyler would calmly turn off the water, leaning forward to make her pussy more accessible to him.&nbsp; She would wait patiently until he finished with a slap on the ass before finishing her dishes.&nbsp; 

The second test was the day Tyler called her into the living room as he lay naked on the sofa.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t help but notice he was extremely turned on about something and then he asked her if she trusted him.&nbsp; To begin with, she made the mistake of laughing and was beaten into unconsciousness.&nbsp; After coming to and being given a day to recover, Tyler asked her the question again, smiling after she said yes.&nbsp;&nbsp; As he began to explain exactly what he wanted her to do, the color slowly drained from Skyler&#8217;s face.&nbsp; 

Tyler&#8217;s test of trust was for Skyler to be on top and in control of his orgasm, which wouldn&#8217;t have been so bad, but the rest of the details were what scared her.&nbsp; She would be in position, holding her hands against her own body while she leaned into his hand with her throat. 
 
The very first time, she panicked, grabbing his arm when she thought she was going to pass out and wound up being beaten until she was unconscious again.&nbsp; The first time was the only lesson she needed to do what she was told, staying in position until she either passed out, or he had his orgasm.&nbsp; It became easier to make him cum, once she learned how to swivel her hips the right way.&nbsp; 

Tyler seemed to enjoy that test at least once a week, making him extremely gentle and loving for at least a few days afterwards.&nbsp; Tyler would always give Skyler at least one good orgasm of her own out of the deal, so at least she had something to look forward to.

Skyler was still curious where the money was coming from, but she knew better than to ever ask any questions.&nbsp; She was sure a good portion of it was coming from his father, but he seemed to be spending a lot on clothing for himself, along with a new station wagon and stereos or whatever else suited him at the time.&nbsp; On occasion Tyler would even by Skyler clothing, but mostly it was only underwear since he seemed to enjoy ripping them off of her on a regular basis.&nbsp; Anything Hunter would get had been sent through the mail by Tyler Sr.

Shortly before Hunter was to have his first birthday, Skyler was pregnant again, but all she could do was cry.&nbsp; She wanted Hunter to have certain things or at the least for Tyler to begin acting like a father and so far neither of those things were happening.&nbsp; On one particular day she attempted to talk Tyler into letting Hunter have a toy or two, so after Tyler returned home from wherever it was he went, she worked up the courage to approach him.

�Tyler, honey��&nbsp; She said, almost choking on her words, but reminding herself it was for her son.&nbsp; �Can&#8217;t we please get Hunter a toy for his birthday?�&nbsp; 
�What do I get?�&nbsp; 
�What d&#8217;you want?�&nbsp; She asked, sitting on his lap.
�You know what I want.�&nbsp; 
�Okay, but can it be a nice toy, please?� 
�We&#8217;ll see if you&#8217;ve gotten any better first,� he smiled.

Skyler knew she would have to concentrate on anything other than the blowjob she was about to give him.&nbsp; Up to that point she had very rarely been able to do it without gagging, especially when he insisted she swallow, but she managed to do it that time, looking up at Tyler with a smile until she noticed the tears in his eyes and her smile left immediately as she went to him.

�Tyler, honey what&#8217;s wrong?&nbsp; Didn&#8217;t I do okay?�&nbsp; Skyler asked, panic in her voice.
�So you can do that for him, but not for me?�&nbsp; Tyler asked as he cried.
�I did it for you, honest honey, I did it for you, I promise!�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t believe you!�&nbsp; Tyler screamed as he backhanded her across the face, knocking her to the floor.&nbsp; �Do it for me, now!�&nbsp; He shouted, as Hunter began to cry.&nbsp; �Now!�&nbsp; He screamed as she moved towards Hunter&#8217;s room.

Skyler did as she was told, concentrating as hard as she could on gently massaging, kissing and licking his balls.&nbsp; She could feel he was forgiving her as she gently kissed the head of his penis, licking along the shaft.&nbsp; 

She took her time, not wanting it to look as though she were rushing through it to get to Hunter, even though that was all she wanted to do.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Smiling up at Tyler, her tongue moved slowly over and around his cock, licking the head as though it was an ice cream cone, giving special attention to his little slit while her hand helped her stroke him to hardness.&nbsp; Slipping her entire mouth over his cock, she slowly traveled the entire length to his pubic hairs, slowly at first and then eventually letting his hand guide her speed as he held her tightly by the hair.&nbsp; By the time she brought him to a loud orgasm, there was a knock at the door.&nbsp; 

Tyler jumped up, tucking himself in as he sent her to get Hunter, while he moved towards the door.&nbsp; Soon Tyler was yelling for her to come to him.&nbsp; 

As she finished changing Hunter&#8217;s diaper, she picked him up before moving rapidly towards Tyler&#8217;s voice, not wanting to be hit again.&nbsp; She was going as fast as she could when he met her at the hall entrance.&nbsp; She began to apologize, telling him she had to change Hunter&#8217;s diaper.&nbsp; He was so sweet to her she almost vomited.&nbsp; 

Tyler walked her to the front door where two officers stood.&nbsp; The male and female officers were looking directly at her as her eyes traveled downward immediately upon noticing them.&nbsp; 

�Nasty bruise on your face,� the female officer commented.
�Yeah, I&#8217;m kinda clumsy.�&nbsp; 
�Why was your baby crying for so long?�&nbsp; She asked Skyler, stepping forward to say hello to Hunter while he buried his face into his mother&#8217;s shoulder.
�Yeah, I told them you were a little amorous,� Tyler laughed.
�You need to let the lady answer the questions sir,� the male officer warned.
�That&#8217;s right, my husband&#8217;s right, I just love him so much, I can&#8217;t keep my hands off him,� Skyler said, leaning into Tyler.
�Could I speak to you outside for a moment ma&#8217;am?�&nbsp; The female officer asked.
�Do I have to?�&nbsp; Skyler asked, moving almost behind Tyler.

Skyler was scared to death to leave Tyler&#8217;s side, she had no idea what he might accuse her of saying and she could feel his anger, even though he was smiling. 

The female officer moved towards Skyler taking her by the arm, but Skyler pulled her own arm away, afraid to let anyone touch her and this officer seemed as though she were a decent person.&nbsp; After feeling she had no choice, Skyler stepped out the door, looking apprehensively back at Tyler when the male officer began closing the door after stepping inside.

�What&#8217;s he saying to him?&nbsp; Please let me go back in, please?�&nbsp; Skyler begged.
�Is he hurting you ma&#8217;am?�&nbsp; 
�Skyler, my name is Skyler and I told you what happened,� Skyler stated as she continued staring at the door.
�I think I know what a backhand bruise looks like Skyler and I can see the bruises on your throat.�&nbsp; 
�Officer, please just let me go back in� please?�&nbsp; 
�Chelsea, you can call me Chelsea.�&nbsp; 
�No I can&#8217;t,� Skyler said, looking at Chelsea with tears running down her face.&nbsp; �Please, just let me go back to him?�&nbsp; 
�It&#8217;s okay, really,� the officer said as she touched Skyler&#8217;s arm.
�Please, you can&#8217;t touch me, please just let me go back to my husband,� Skyler begged.
�How old are you Skyler?�&nbsp; 
�eighteen.�&nbsp; 
�We could help you, if you need to get away from him.�&nbsp; 

Skyler actually glanced at Chelsea for a split second, almost tempted to take her up on her offer until she remembered that her safety wasn&#8217;t really in question.&nbsp; The notion lasted for only that second, when the reality of the situation returned to slap her in the face.

�You can&#8217;t help me, I&#8217;m 18 years-old and I wanna go back to my husband, please let me go before you can&#8217;t.�&nbsp; She stated, looking Chelsea directly in the eyes.
�What does that mean?�&nbsp; 
�Nothing, I&#8217;m just being odd.&nbsp; Everyone loves Tyler, so just let me go back to him now,� Skyler stated firmly.

Officer Chelsea Gold was a slender woman who looked almost too delicate to be tough, but she was.&nbsp; Her strawberry-blonde hair was shoulder length and feathered back, making the fact that she had two different colored eyes very noticeable.&nbsp; One was blue with flecks of hazel, while the other was hazel with flecks of blue and looking her in the eyes was almost mesmerizing. 
&nbsp; 
Chelsea was new to the force and not much older than Skyler, but she loved her job and had already received an award for saving her partner by taking a bullet for him.&nbsp; She had been offered a job as a detective, but enjoyed what she did and chose to continue doing it for the time being.&nbsp; Chelsea had wanted to be a police officer ever since she was seven years old, after watching her father get shot in a drug bust gone wrong.&nbsp; Her father wasn&#8217;t a police officer though, her father was the drug dealer, but she watched as the officer gave him every opportunity to turn himself in before shooting him.&nbsp; She also watched the same officer put himself in the line of fire to protect her as she ran to her father&#8217;s side.&nbsp; 

Since then all she had ever wanted was to help people and that was why the whole situation she was looking at bothered her so much.&nbsp; She could tell by the look on Skyler&#8217;s face that she had been beaten down so badly it would take something drastic to pull her out. 
 
She didn&#8217;t know what made Skyler so special, but she wanted to do what she could to help her.

�How about if I just check in from time to time,� Chelsea insisted.
�No!&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry, I didn&#8217;t mean to shout, but please don&#8217;t?�&nbsp; 

Chelsea Looked at Skyler giving her a nod of defeat; she could see that Skyler was too afraid of her husband to say a word against him.&nbsp; She wanted to help her in the worst way, but it wasn&#8217;t going to happen on that day, so she knocked on the door.&nbsp; As her partner opened it, he was nodding his head and laughing with Tyler.&nbsp; 

Skyler&#8217;s point had most definitely been proven, everybody loved Tyler and he could win over any situation he was confronted with.&nbsp; She also knew the smile he was giving her and she couldn&#8217;t fight the tears coming to her eyes, so she excused herself to get Hunter some food.

She knew she was in trouble as soon as she heard the door shut.&nbsp; Turning Hunter&#8217;s chair, Skyler faced it towards the wall, pouring some cereal on the tray so he could pick it up when he wanted.&nbsp; She knew Tyler was just waiting for the officers to drive away.&nbsp; 

Skyler moved away from Hunter, not wanting him to see anything or get hurt as she watched Tyler walk into the kitchen.

�I swear I didn&#8217;t say anything Tyler.&nbsp; Please?&nbsp; I swear I didn&#8217;t.�&nbsp; 
�What&#8217;d she ask you?�&nbsp; Tyler asked as he hugged her.&nbsp; 

She put her arms around him, wishing her hands would stop shaking.

�She just asked the same thing she did inside and asked if I wanted to leave you.&nbsp; I told her no and asked her to leave us alone.�&nbsp; 
�Don&#8217;t you think that by asking her to leave us alone, you might possibly make her more interested in us?�&nbsp; 
�No!&nbsp; I swear she was fine with it.�&nbsp; 

Tyler kissed Skyler on the head before turning around and just when Skyler thought she might have gotten away with not getting hit, Tyler swung around to backhand her, knocking her to the floor.&nbsp; 

Waiting until she was trying to get up, he kicked her as hard as he could in the upper thigh.&nbsp; Skyler screamed while Tyler picked her up by the hair, knocking the cereal box off the table before pushing her face first onto it.&nbsp; After pulling her sweat pants down, he ripped off her panties, determined to teach her a lesson as he fucked her hard in the ass.&nbsp; She tried calming Hunter, taking her mind off her own pain, until Tyler smashed her head into the table as he shouted at her to shut up, then as quickly as it had begun, it was over.

�Shut him the fuck up already!&nbsp; I have to leave for a couple of days and don&#8217;t try to leave because you know I&#8217;ll find you.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t answer the door for anyone; understand?�&nbsp; 
�I won&#8217;t, but where&#8217;re you going?�&nbsp; She asked, immediately covering her face as his hand raised.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m sorry, I don&#8217;t need to know.�&nbsp; 
�That&#8217;s right, so just shut the fuck up and do what I tell you!&nbsp; I&#8217;ll be back day after tomorrow at the latest.&nbsp; No TV, no radio, same rules and you know I&#8217;ll find out if you don&#8217;t listen.�&nbsp; 

Tyler kissed Skyler goodbye, told her he loved her and left without packing a bag, but he carried the broom out of the house with him. 
 
Skyler had no idea where he was going, or what he needed the broom for, but she knew it meant two days without a beating or being forced to have sex, plus Hunter could actually play around the house and not just in his room.&nbsp; That was all she really cared about at that moment.

What Skyler didn&#8217;t know was that Tyler planned on teaching her the ultimate lesson for talking to the officer at all.&nbsp; 

Tyler made the five hour trip back to their hometown, waiting until he saw Heather leaving for school.&nbsp; Once Asia had left for work, Tyler drove around to the back road, walking through the woods behind the house, taking the broom with him and leaning it against the outside of the house as he quietly walked in through the back door.&nbsp; Taking his boots off before going through the kitchen, he made his way into the bedroom just off the living room and there was Fred.&nbsp; 

&#8216;The useless old bastard was still in bed,&#8217; Tyler thought to himself as he walked into the room, taking Asia&#8217;s pillow and holding it over Fred&#8217;s face.&nbsp; Fred fought, but he wasn&#8217;t in good enough shape to fight back, the most he could do was grip Tyler&#8217;s arm, digging fingernails into the sleeve of his jacket. 
 
It was over in seconds and as quietly as he had entered the house, Tyler exited, using the broom to destroy his boot prints, leaving the same way he entered. 
 
Tyler was almost positive that Skyler would straighten up quite nicely once she saw her father&#8217;s obituary in the paper.

Skyler did exactly as she was told while Tyler was gone, not even daring to eat anything other than her morning toast during his absence.&nbsp; Most of her time was spent playing with Hunter and the toy she had made for him.&nbsp; It was only an empty cigarette pack Tyler had given her, with a couple of pebbles in it after she had begged him to get them for her and she finished it by wrapping it with electrical tape.&nbsp; Tyler was actually impressed at her inventiveness and Hunter loved it. 
 
While Tyler wasn&#8217;t home, she let Hunter play with a big spoon and a pan.&nbsp; She thought he was quite the little drummer, but as soon as the holiday had begun, it ended.
&nbsp; 
When Tyler returned home, he carried in a large container of building blocks for Hunter, encouraging Skyler to give him a very enthusiastic kiss and it was a kiss he liked.&nbsp; He began to wonder if maybe being nice to the kid every so often might be the way to go.&nbsp; And that was exactly what he did.&nbsp; He still had his nasty periods, but he was beginning to have a few more &#8216;nice&#8217; moments as well, bringing Hunter candy bars, cookies and an occasional toy. 
 
Tyler was beginning to enjoy the fact that Skyler would take it upon herself to give him blowjobs on these occasions and she was actually getting better at it, but she still needed to be taught a lesson about talking to the lady cop.&nbsp; 

It was several days later that they received the very first hometown paper he had subscribed to.&nbsp; Skyler noticed the paper as Tyler opened it to begin reading.

�You got the Echo?�&nbsp; She asked, looking at him curiously.&nbsp; �Why?�&nbsp; 
�I thought I might like to keep up on some of the local events.�&nbsp; 
�Can I read it too?�&nbsp; 
�Maybe, we&#8217;ll see.�&nbsp; 

Skyler was extremely sweet to Tyler for the rest of the day and into the night.&nbsp; As soon as they got into bed, she began kissing him, nibbling his nipples the way he liked, teasing him until he was almost whimpering as he began begging her to make him cum.&nbsp; As Skyler crawled on top of him, she sat for a moment before leaning down to give Tyler one of the deepest kisses she had ever given him, slowly beginning to glide up and down on his penis.&nbsp; She had gotten him so worked up that she had only managed several glides before Tyler was pulling her close to him as his hips began thrusting into her. 
 
Just when Tyler thought they were finished, Skyler began moving down his body to give him one of the best blowjobs she had ever given him.&nbsp; He was so happy with her that he gave Skyler one of his best smiles as he began kissing her face, her neck, her shoulders and moving on to her nipples.&nbsp; He teased her so long that she couldn&#8217;t stop touching him, to the point of pulling him close enough to whisper, &#8216;please&#8217; into his ear, encouraging him to slide down. 
 
Tyler began sliding his tongue through her vulva, into her vagina, causing Skyler to begin almost fucking his face.&nbsp; Tyler loved it as he continued teasing her with his tongue until Skyler was almost screaming his name as she begged for release.&nbsp; 

By the time Skyler was ready to explode, Tyler was too and he slid his cock inside gently before he began fucking her hard, causing her to begin such a deep orgasm that she clawed into Tyler&#8217;s back, pushing him into such a powerfully intense orgasm, that his entire body began to shudder.&nbsp; As he rolled off of her, Skyler curled into his arms.

�That was fantastic Tyler.�&nbsp; 
�It was fucking fantastic.�
�I think that was the best yet, you do know how to turn me on.�&nbsp; 
�I love you.�&nbsp; 
�I love you too.� 
�Good, but you&#8217;re still not reading the paper.�&nbsp; 
�That&#8217;s okay, I don&#8217;t even care.�

Skyler acted nonchalant about the entire subject, while deep down she began thinking up new names for Tyler.&nbsp; She actually wouldn&#8217;t mind being married to him if he could just stop being such an asshole.&nbsp; When he wanted to, he could be wonderful, but it could be the slightest thing that would set him off and she never knew what it might be.&nbsp; It was best not to examine it all too closely; she tended to get too depressed when she did.&nbsp; Gradually Skyler drifted off to sleep.

Through the following week, Skyler managed to maintain her sexual enthusiasm to the point of giving Tyler several extra blowjobs each day.&nbsp; By the following week, the paper was laying at her spot on the table. 
 
Skyler smiled as she walked over to give Tyler a kiss before making his breakfast and setting Hunter up with his.

As she began reading, Tyler waited anxiously for her to get to the obituaries.&nbsp; When she did eventually get there, she noticed the date of her father&#8217;s death.&nbsp; Her eyes filled as she put her head down on the table, continuing to ask &#8216;why&#8217;, over and over again.&nbsp; For the longest time all Skyler could do was cry while Tyler watched her with a stupid looking grin on his face. 
 
�What did I do Tyler?�&nbsp; She asked, raising her head to look at him.&nbsp; �He was a sick, old man and I didn&#8217;t do &#8216;anything&#8217; to make you do that.�&nbsp; 
�You trying to say I hurt your dad?�&nbsp; 
�Don&#8217;t fuck with me!&nbsp; I know you killed my father!&nbsp; I&#8217;m not the fucking idiot you think I am!&nbsp; I just want you to tell me why!�&nbsp; Skyler shouted, jumping out of her chair.
�Are you really calling me a liar and raising your voice to me?!�&nbsp; Tyler shouted as he stood up, knocking over his chair.
�Just fucking do it already!&nbsp; I don&#8217;t care anymore!�&nbsp; She screamed as she stood her ground.

Tyler walked over to Skyler, hitting her so hard that she flew across the kitchen and into the counter, breaking her arm.&nbsp; She had finished with her tirade once she heard Hunter scream and began to apologize for her accusations.&nbsp; 

Tyler watched Skyler&#8217;s arm as it began to swell before he calmly made her a cast out of cardboard.&nbsp; She wound up thanking him, before taking care of Hunter with her one good arm.

Her father was gone and there was nothing she could do to bring him back, but her mother and sister were still okay, Hunter was fine and she would be having his brother or sister soon.&nbsp; She wanted these babies; they were her strength to continue on.&nbsp; Skyler had absolutely no doubt that she would have let Tyler kill her long ago if Hunter hadn&#8217;t been born.&nbsp; She needed to let her father go and be nice to Tyler again, for Hunter&#8217;s sake, so she apologized the only way she knew he&#8217;d understand, smiling as she offered herself to him.

When the time arrived, Tristan Matthew was born almost as quickly as Hunter had been.&nbsp; Tyler chose not to hang around, disappearing as he had when Hunter was born, so the nurses brought a crib into Skyler&#8217;s room with Hunter in it.&nbsp; 

When Tyler did finally show up he looked at the name tag on the baby and sat down to cry.

�I just don&#8217;t understand,� he sobbed. 
�Tyler, why&#8217;re you crying?&nbsp; What&#8217;d I do?�&nbsp; 
�Don&#8217;t most women show that they love their husbands by naming a baby after him?&nbsp; My mom did.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been trying so hard and you just keep doing things to piss me off!�&nbsp; He exclaimed through gritted teeth.
�Tyler, I&#8217;m sorry, I just didn&#8217;t think you cared and I&#8217;ve liked these names since I was little, I&#8217;m so sorry; I&#8217;m all out of names now, I promise I&#8217;ll name our next son after you, please don&#8217;t be angry?�&nbsp; 
�The next one?&nbsp; You promise?�&nbsp; 
�I promise.�&nbsp; 

Tyler squeezed the tears out of his eyes with his fingers before walking over to bend down, giving Skyler one of the tenderest kisses he had ever given.

�You should&#8217;ve thought of it on your own you ungrateful bitch,� he whispered.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll be back when it&#8217;s time to take you home.�&nbsp; 

Skyler was still shaking when Officer Chelsea Gold walked into her room.&nbsp; Skyler had been trying to feed Tristan, but she couldn&#8217;t seem to keep the bottle in his mouth with her hands trembling the way they were.

�Mind if I try?�&nbsp; 
�What&#8217;re you doing here?�&nbsp; 
�Well, I saw your husband leaving while I was visiting a friend, so I found out where you were and thought I would stop in to see your new addition, so again, mind if I try?�&nbsp; 
�Well, since I can&#8217;t seem to stop shaking, someone should.&nbsp; Are you sure he&#8217;s gone?�&nbsp; 
�Positive,� Chelsea assured her, taking Tristan out of her arms.&nbsp; �You have some beautiful babies.�&nbsp; 
�Thank you,� Skyler said, shakily handing over the bottle.
�Why so shaky, if you don&#8217;t mind my asking?�&nbsp; 
�I really don&#8217;t know you, so I&#8217;d rather not say,� Skyler stated before she laughed.&nbsp; �That&#8217;s not true, even if I knew you, I wouldn&#8217;t wanna tell you.�&nbsp; 
�You don&#8217;t have any friends?�&nbsp; 
�Not since I was 16.�&nbsp; 
�You must know somebody?�&nbsp; 
�The only person I know, besides Tyler, is you.�&nbsp; 
�How long has he been beating you Skyler?�&nbsp; 
�Please don&#8217;t make me talk about this.&nbsp; If he finds out you&#8217;re here��&nbsp; 
�What would he do?�&nbsp; 
��&nbsp; Listen, I know you think you&#8217;re gonna help me, but you can&#8217;t.&nbsp; He&#8217;s been in charge since I was 16 and that&#8217;s just how it is.�&nbsp; 
�It doesn&#8217;t have to be, you can change it.�&nbsp; 
�How?&nbsp; How could &#8216;I&#8217; possibly change anything?�&nbsp; 
�All you have to do is tell me about him and I could look into things in my spare time, try to help you at least.�&nbsp; 
�Why me?�&nbsp; 
��&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; I think it mostly had to do with my partner&#8217;s attitude after we left your house that day.&nbsp; He thought your husband was a great guy, but I saw your eyes and the way you held onto your son.&nbsp; You wouldn&#8217;t give him to your husband because you don&#8217;t trust him, do you?�&nbsp; 
�No,� Skyler said quietly, hanging her head.
�Where does he work?�&nbsp; 
�He doesn&#8217;t, he only leaves the house occasionally and it&#8217;s never for very long,� Skyler explained.&nbsp; �Please don&#8217;t let him know I talked to you.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t care about him hurting me, but I don&#8217;t want him hurting any of my family; anymore of my family or people I know.�&nbsp; 
�What d&#8217;you mean by that?�&nbsp; 

Skyler actually took the time to look into Chelsea&#8217;s eyes at that moment, studying the lady officer&#8217;s face.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t positive if it was because the thoughts had rambled around in her mind for so many years, or if she just really wanted to tell somebody, or if she actually thought the officer might actually be able to help her get away from Tyler, but whatever it was caused her to begin talking about everything she had been unable to express for so long.

�I can&#8217;t prove anything, I just know it.&nbsp; A boy, David Klasp, disappeared after I talked to him at a party and he&#8217;s never been found.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t tell anyone because Tyler raped me that night and threatened my family.&nbsp; I went to sleep with my cat that same night and the next morning he was dead on the porch.&nbsp; I know my bedroom door was shut and that was Tyler&#8217;s warning to me to just do what he said.&nbsp; Later, two other kids died from apparent suicides and after we moved down here, a girl who gave me a ride to my last party disappeared.&nbsp; They found her face down in a swamp not too long ago, but I&#8217;m sure that was Tyler too.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t care that I told him I was gay; he had been planning how to get to me since ninth grade.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what he told me after my parents made me marry him when I got pregnant.&nbsp; I know he had something to do with my father&#8217;s death, but I also know that if he thought he was going to lose me, he&#8217;d kill the rest of my family first and I don&#8217;t want my family or babies dying just because he&#8217;s insane.�&nbsp; 
�Is he good to you sometimes at least?�&nbsp; 
�He loves me, so I let him do what he wants, but even that&#8217;s mostly so he&#8217;s not mean to Hunter.&nbsp; He just started buying him toys recently, but it&#8217;s pretty rare.&nbsp; He got his first toy when he was a little over a year old.�&nbsp; 
�But is he good to &#8216;you&#8217; ever?�&nbsp; 
�I guess, but it never lasts too long; even when we go to sleep, he needs to be wrapped completely around me, I just feel like I&#8217;m being crushed most nights.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m sorry, I wish I could tell you this could be fixed overnight, but I think it may take some time.�&nbsp; 
�It&#8217;s already going on three years, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d be able to function on my own anymore anyway,� Skyler laughed sardonically.&nbsp; �I just know I&#8217;m gonna need some rest before I go home this time.&nbsp; He doesn&#8217;t like the kids, but he was upset that I didn&#8217;t name either of them after him.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t know why he beat me after Hunter was born but now I do.&nbsp; When I told my mother all of this, she didn&#8217;t believe me, not about all of this, but about how mean he was.&nbsp; My own parents took his word over mine and not even my sister would say goodbye to me the day I left.&nbsp; When I told my parents I was a lesbian, my mother told me I wasn&#8217;t and that I had to marry Tyler.&nbsp; She doesn&#8217;t even know about Hunter,� Skyler continued on.&nbsp; �I&#8217;d like to see my sister, she&#8217;s 14 now and always such a mouthy little shit.&nbsp; I bet she would&#8217;ve been fun to know,� Skyler had been in a daze, snapping out of it when she saw movement.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m sorry; I don&#8217;t know why I told you all that, I just haven&#8217;t talked to anyone besides Tyler in so long.�&nbsp; 
�Don&#8217;t worry about it, I did ask,� Chelsea reminded her.

She had no idea what had come over her, other than the fact that she hadn&#8217;t had another human being to talk to in years.&nbsp; She hadn&#8217;t ever thought of Tyler as human, so she never counted what was said to him.&nbsp; Skyler relaxed slightly as she realized it was just Chelsea putting Tristan back into his little bed. 
 
Chelsea walked over to Skyler, taking hold of her hand.

�D&#8217;you have any ideas at all how Tyler makes money?�&nbsp; 
�No,� Skyler shook her head.&nbsp; �I tried asking him when he bought the house, but he told me to worry about my little bastard instead of worrying about what he does.&nbsp; I think his father&#8217;s paying for everything, but I don&#8217;t really know for sure.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m gonna catch him at something, I promise you.�&nbsp; 
�I wanna believe you, really I do, but I know how he gets away with everything.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t testify against him about anything because he&#8217;ll hurt the people I love.&nbsp; I haven&#8217;t even been out of the house since before Hunter was born.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t look out the window, even if he&#8217;s gone, because he always knows.&nbsp; I&#8217;m pretty sure he has cameras around the house, but I don&#8217;t even dare look for &#8216;em.&nbsp; Hunter hasn&#8217;t ever seen a cartoon and he won&#8217;t let us listen to the radio.&nbsp; You may not believe it, but I use to have a lot of friends.�&nbsp; 
�You&#8217;re very pretty, I&#8217;m sure you were extremely popular,� Chelsea said as Skyler blushed.
�Thank you.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t feel so pretty these days, mostly I just feel dirty.�&nbsp; 
�You try taking care of yourself as best you can, I&#8217;ll do what I need to on my end.&nbsp; Okay?�&nbsp; 
�Thank you for listening to me, but I still think you&#8217;re wasting your time.�&nbsp; 
�I guess we&#8217;ll see.�&nbsp; 
�I wish I could help you, but I can&#8217;t take that chance.&nbsp; Too many of my friends and family are gone because I did something he didn&#8217;t like and I can&#8217;t take the chance that anyone else&#8217;ll be hurt.�&nbsp; 
�I understand and I wouldn&#8217;t ask you to do anything, I&#8217;ll see what I can do out here.�

 Chelsea gave Skyler&#8217;s hand a gentle squeeze before leaving her alone again.

Tyler showed up exactly on schedule to take Skyler home.&nbsp; On the ride to the house, she was trying to think of a way to keep from being beaten, finally grasping at the only straw she had.

�That lady cop came to see me in the hospital.�&nbsp; 
�For what?!&nbsp; What the fuck did you tell her?!�&nbsp; 
�I didn&#8217;t tell her anything!&nbsp; She just wanted to know what you do for money; I don&#8217;t know anything &#8216;to&#8217; tell her!�&nbsp; 
�Why&#8217;re you telling me this?�&nbsp; Tyler asked, looking at her suspiciously.
�I don&#8217;t want anything bad to happen to you, despite what you think,� Skyler insisted as she stared at him.

She was correct in her assumption, only needing to volunteer for blowjobs the following two months, but once her healing time was up, things went back to normal.&nbsp; 

Tyler beat her extremely bad at one point when she began throwing up one morning.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t believe how he had acted before he actually beat her, becoming apologetic and literally bawled as he began punching her in the stomach.&nbsp; He beat her until she began bleeding from the vagina and he sobbed as he held her afterward.&nbsp; 

To redeem himself, Tyler took care of the boys until Skyler could move around again and he wasn&#8217;t half bad with them.&nbsp; He played blocks, along with other games and they enjoyed it, as if they knew it wouldn&#8217;t last.&nbsp; She wound up thanking Tyler with the only thing she knew he wanted, the customary blowjob.

During the following months, Tyler never left the house except for groceries and cigarettes.&nbsp; He did seem to buy quite a few disposable cell phones for a reason Skyler could never quite figure out, but she tried not to pay too much attention to what Tyler was doing and mostly focused on the boys.

Tristan was almost a year old before Skyler was being beaten for throwing up again one morning and again Tyler sobbed as he held her afterwards and again Skyler thanked Tyler for watching the boys once she recovered enough to take care of them.&nbsp; 

Sometime after this, Tyler felt it was safe for him to leave the house again.&nbsp; Hunter was three by that time and Tristan was one.&nbsp; He must have been very careful since he always returned home.

Skyler knew she was pregnant with another boy after going three months without any morning sickness.&nbsp;&nbsp; She walked up to Tyler, giving him a kiss before sitting on his lap.

�I wanna name him Tyler, for sure, but can he be Tyler Logan?�&nbsp; Skyler asked expecting to be beaten at any moment.
�Tyler Logan� actually I like it.&nbsp; You done good honey.�&nbsp; 

Skyler was so relieved she asked Tyler if there was anything special he wanted and he suddenly had a twinkle in his eyes as he explained what it was.&nbsp; She told him to go into the bedroom and she would be in after she checked on the boys. 
 
He was a pig, but after so many years, she didn&#8217;t even think twice about any of his requests as she made sure the boys were napping before putting up the gate.&nbsp; 

She almost began to cry when she saw Hunter sleeping with his arm protectively around Tristan.
&nbsp; 
Walking into the bedroom, she saw Tyler already undressed and waiting for her.&nbsp; After undressing, Skyler crawled onto the bed where Tyler&#8217;s cock was already standing at attention.&nbsp; She smiled at him, but she didn&#8217;t mean it; it seemed to make him happy though, so she guessed it was worth it as she began kissing his balls and his penis before licking up the shaft and circling her tongue around in his little slit.
&nbsp; 
She knew she was doing well as his hips thrust at her involuntarily.&nbsp; She had only just put her mouth over his penis, lightly scraping it with her teeth on her way down, when he was telling her to get on her knees.

Tyler slipped his penis into her pussy and it made her wonder if he had forgotten where he had originally intended to put that thing, but after a couple of thrusts in and out, he slid back out, gliding the head of his penis up to her anus.&nbsp; 

She guessed he must have done something right when it didn&#8217;t feel as though she were being ripped open.&nbsp; She still didn&#8217;t care for it or the pressure it created, but she could live with it.&nbsp; 

Tyler slipped his finger down to Skyler&#8217;s pussy, gliding it in circles around and over her clit until she was thrusting her hips into and away from him, seemingly intensifying his visit up her ass.&nbsp; 

She thought for sure he would have cum by that point, but he managed to hold out a few minutes longer and Skyler swore she could feel his wild little sperm as they bounce off her insides until eventually he let her go. 

Tyler was holding her and having a cigarette after they had finished, kissing her on the head.&nbsp; 

�Funny, it only took you four years to warm up to me.�&nbsp; 
�But I&#8217;m here, I do love you Tyler.�&nbsp; 
�I love you too.�&nbsp;

Chapter 6

Six months later, Tyler went through his same routine of calling the ambulance and leaving his wife alone with the boys while he vanished.&nbsp; 

Skyler was in her hospital room feeding Tyler Logan when Tyler walked into the room.&nbsp; He was so full of himself that he actually believed she named the baby Tyler because she was in love with him.&nbsp; 

Little Tyler was the only son that Tyler would take the time to hold and talk to.&nbsp; Skyler smiled, trying not to think about how much she hated that he couldn&#8217;t do that with his other two sons, especially since both boys were standing in their cribs watching.&nbsp; 

She felt guilty as two nurses walked into the room to take Hunter and Tristan to the daycare for a little playtime.&nbsp; Looking at her hands Skyler tried not to notice the way the nurses were looking at her as Tyler completely ignored his other two sons.&nbsp; 

That was also the first time he had ever gone down to the gift shop, returning to her room with flowers.&nbsp; Skyler made a big deal about them, but she was so angry, she literally made her own arm bleed after digging her fingernails into it.&nbsp; 

After giving Skyler the flowers and informing her that he would be back when she was ready to be released, Tyler gave her a passionate kiss before disappearing again.&nbsp; 

Skyler half expected to see Chelsea while she was in the hospital and was a little disappointed when she didn&#8217;t, but she had assumed the officer was too afraid to tell her to her face that she couldn&#8217;t help after all.&nbsp; 

Suddenly Skyler felt alone again as she considered what her life could have been like if she had actually been able to ever have anything other than life and death choices.&nbsp; 

She suddenly had an urge to talk to her mother, but knew it would be entirely too dangerous for her mother, sister and possibly the boys.&nbsp; There was no way she could take that chance.&nbsp; 

Skyler began thinking about Heather at 16, wondering if she had a lot of friends, or just one or two very close ones.&nbsp; Smiling to herself, she closed her eyes and imagined what her sister must look like.

Tyler returned on schedule, picking Skyler and the boys up from the hospital to deliver them back to the house.&nbsp; 

Immediately Tyler started picking up gifts for Little Tyler, beginning with a brand new crib, while Hunter and Tristan still shared the mattress on the floor.&nbsp; 

Skyler could feel her anger rising, but she managed to keep herself from saying anything until one day when she couldn&#8217;t fight her indignation any longer.&nbsp; Hunter and Tristan were quietly drawing pictures in their bedroom, while Tyler was cradling little Tyler in the living room.

�Tyler honey, what about your other two sons?�&nbsp; Skyler asked, trying to be nice.
�This is my boy,� Tyler said, kissing little Tyler.
�They&#8217;re all &#8216;your&#8217; boys Tyler.&nbsp; Is this how you want them to see their own father treating &#8216;em?�&nbsp; 
�You know, I haven&#8217;t hit you in a while now, but you&#8217;re begging for it,� Tyler warned.
�So basically I should&#8217;ve named them all Tyler so you&#8217;d pay attention to and hold them too.�&nbsp; 

Once baby Tyler had been put into his crib, Tyler warned the other two boys about waking their brother before shutting the door and walking back out to Skyler, where he began beating her until she was doing nothing but screaming.&nbsp; By the time there was a knock at the door, all she could do was lie in the corner curled up in a puddle of her own urine.&nbsp; 

Skyler was afraid to open her eyes when she heard footsteps heading towards her, she could do nothing but apologize repeatedly.

�Jesus Christ!&nbsp; Get him the fuck outta here Matt!&nbsp; Take him downtown so he can cool off,� the female officer shouted.&nbsp; �Can you move Sky?�&nbsp; 
�My family used to call me Sky,� she mumbled through her swollen lips.&nbsp; �I just need a minute, but don&#8217;t take him away, please.�&nbsp; 
�I think he&#8217;s already gone.&nbsp; He needs to calm down a little, but he&#8217;ll only be gone overnight.&nbsp; You need to press charges before he kills you and right now I think you need some stitches.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;ll be okay, I can&#8217;t, I won&#8217;t leave the house without Tyler,� Skyler insisted.
�Jesus, you&#8217;re a diehard aren&#8217;t you?�&nbsp; 
�You know the story.&nbsp; It didn&#8217;t do you any good though, did it?�&nbsp; 
�Not yet, but I&#8217;m not giving up.�&nbsp; 
�Me either,� Skyler replied, glancing at Chelsea through the only eye she could open.

Hunter and Tristan began crying for mommy and it would be the only thing to make Skyler force herself into moving.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t know too much of anything at that point, but she did know her babies needed their mother.

�Maybe you should clean up before you go in to them,� Chelsea suggested, helping her off the floor.
�They&#8217;ve seen me this way hundreds of times, they need me and they&#8217;re gonna wake their brother.�&nbsp; 
�Brother?&nbsp; More than two?&nbsp; No sisters yet?�&nbsp; 
�Might&#8217;ve been two, but no girls yet.�&nbsp; 

After grabbing a garbage bag for Skyler to sit on, Chelsea helped her into the bedroom.&nbsp; By the time they reached Hunter and Tristan, Little Tyler had joined in the crying.&nbsp; 

Skyler dug for all the strength she had to pick up baby Tyler before sitting on the bag with Hunter and Tristan.&nbsp; All three boys clung to their mother as they stared at Chelsea.&nbsp; Skyler introduced them, but it was fairly obvious that none of the boys were use to people.&nbsp; They clung to the only person they knew they could trust.&nbsp; 

Chelsea did the only thing she could do; she called a doctor to come to the house before rolling up her sleeves.&nbsp; Once she found a pan for some water and a washcloth, Chelsea began washing the blood off of Skyler&#8217;s face.

�We&#8217;ve gotta stop meeting like this,� Skyler mumbled. 
�I think so too,� Chelsea agreed, trying to smile.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll be happiest when I can get you outta here permanently,� 
�To go where?�&nbsp; 
�Guess we&#8217;ll worry about that when it happens.�&nbsp; 

While the doctor gave Skyler several stitches in the side of her head, Chelsea continued cleansing what she could reach.&nbsp; They had barely finished cleaning her up before Tyler was on the floor crying and apologizing.&nbsp; 

Chelsea turned to look at the other officer who was shrugging and telling her that Tyler was calm now and would be fine.&nbsp; 

As Tyler was crying, Skyler told him it was okay and that everything would be fine.&nbsp; After kissing him on the head, she gave Chelsea a look that basically said, &#8216;I told you&#8217;.&nbsp; 

Chelsea felt helpless as she left Tyler with a warning about not wanting to be called back to that house anymore so he had better behave himself.&nbsp; 

The moment the strangers had been let out of the house by Tyler, he returned, taking baby Tyler out of Skyler&#8217;s arms and putting the sleeping boy back into his crib.

�D&#8217;you understand how things are now?�&nbsp; He asked, wiping the phony tears away.&nbsp; 
�I understood before, I just hoped maybe they could change.�&nbsp; 
�It doesn&#8217;t really matter what you hoped, you think you&#8217;d know that by now you dumb bitch.&nbsp; The only things you want that I&#8217;m letting you keep are my son and those two little bastards,� Tyler stated coldly before exiting the room.

As Chelsea and Matt walked out the front door of the house, she punched him in the arm before they got into the squad car.&nbsp; Chelsea stared at the house as Matt began driving away.

�Why didn&#8217;t you take him downtown?�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t know, the guy was crying almost hysterically and looked so pitiful when he told me he didn&#8217;t like getting so rough with her, but she always pushed him to the point of where he just lost control.&nbsp; He said she told him that he wasn&#8217;t even the father of his first two sons.�&nbsp; 
�He&#8217;s lying to you Matt!&nbsp; Didn&#8217;t you even look at those boys?!&nbsp; They all look exactly like him!�&nbsp; 
�I didn&#8217;t look that closely I guess.�&nbsp; 
�Well look next time!&nbsp; The guy&#8217;s got some major problems.�&nbsp; 
�What is it about her Chels?&nbsp; Why you so sure &#8216;she&#8217;s&#8217; telling you the truth?&nbsp; Maybe she&#8217;s the liar?�&nbsp; 
�No, I don&#8217;t think so.&nbsp; Can&#8217;t you see the look in her eyes when he&#8217;s around?&nbsp; She&#8217;s scared to death of him and I just wanna help her get outta there.�&nbsp; 
�Wait until I tell Val you&#8217;ve replaced her,� Matt grinned.
�No way buddy!&nbsp; As soon as she gets smart and dumps your ass, I&#8217;ll be there to make her forget all about you.�&nbsp; 

Matt laughed as he looked over at his partner.&nbsp; He knew she was giving him shit, but he was fine with it.&nbsp; She had already proven she would give her own life for his by taking the bullet meant for him and he was secure in the knowledge that his wife adored him, so he reached over, giving Chelsea a small punch in the arm before asking if there was anything he could do to help her with her cause.

Chapter 7

Through the following year, Skyler kept a close eye on Hunter and Tristan.&nbsp; Whenever they would begin going after one of baby Tyler&#8217;s toys, she would have to try redirecting their attention to the few toys of their own.&nbsp; She knew Tyler wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to hit either one of them if they even looked as though they were headed towards something of baby Tyler&#8217;s.&nbsp; 

Tyler seemed to have a problem focusing on two people at one time, basically ending up paying very little attention to Skyler while spending as much time as he could with little Tyler.&nbsp; 

When the urge did hit him to have sex, it had begun taking an extremely violent turn.&nbsp; Not that he had been all that gentle in the past, but it had changed and suddenly he wanted her to fight him.&nbsp; If she didn&#8217;t fight to his satisfaction, he would begin choking her.&nbsp; Not even Tyler was sure why he needed her to be afraid, but it seemed that the closer Skyler would get to passing out, the more excited he would get.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

The only time Tyler would even smile or talk after a while, was when he was holding little Tyler.&nbsp; 

Skyler had been doing her usual cleaning, smiling down at Hunter and Tristan as they drew pictures on old envelopes with pens and in one swift move, the air was knocked out of her as Tyler jumped off the couch, grabbing her by the neck and throwing her onto her back on the floor.&nbsp; As Tyler began to unbuckle his belt, the boys stood up, immediately heading for their bedroom.

Hunter and Tristan didn&#8217;t even look up anymore when Tyler was in one of his moods to go after Skyler.&nbsp; They had been trained well by Skyler and the moment Tyler would go after their mother, they would go to their room without saying a word.&nbsp; 

Skyler&#8217;s neck was already bruised from Tyler&#8217;s last attack the day before, but she didn&#8217;t dare reach for it, knowing it would only make things worse, so she let the tears slide out of her eyes, lifting her hips while he roughly pulled the sweatpants off her.&nbsp; 

Tyler was already hard when he pulled his underwear down and he smiled before getting to his knees, ripping Skyler&#8217;s panties off her body before grabbing her around the throat and roughly shoving his cock into her.&nbsp; He began slamming into Skyler so hard; she could feel the rug burn on her ass from the friction.&nbsp; 

She began pushing and hitting against his chest as Tyler laughed.&nbsp; Just about the time her eyes began to flutter and her head felt as though it would explode, she could feel Tyler&#8217;s cum shooting into her before he collapsed on top of her, finally allowing her to breathe.

Smiling, Tyler climbed off of Skyler; putting his clothes back together while she lay there gasping for breath.&nbsp; 

�I have to go out for a little bit, but maybe we can have some more fun when I get back,� Tyler suggested.
�I&#8217;m on fire just thinking about it.�
�You really need to watch your smart mouth before I have to do what I always told you I&#8217;d do,� Tyler warned, looking towards the boy&#8217;s room.
�I&#8217;m sorry honey, I didn&#8217;t mean it, I swear.�
�That&#8217;s better.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Skyler began putting her pants on as she absentmindedly reached for her neck.&nbsp; 

�Want me to hold your neck again?�&nbsp; 
�No, please?�&nbsp; 
�Then take your damned hands off of it.�&nbsp; 

Tyler pulled Skyler off the floor, giving her a good, hard kiss before walking out the door.&nbsp; As soon as he had gone, Skyler put her sweats back on before putting a cold washcloth around her neck to cool it off a little.&nbsp; 

As the boys began waking up from their naps, Skyler noticed the time; it occurred to her that Tyler had been gone for almost four hours by then and she should get the boys fed before starting his dinner.&nbsp; 

Tristan and Little Tyler were in their high chairs when there was a knock at the door.&nbsp; Skyler was too afraid to even ask who it was as she inched towards it.&nbsp; 

She was close to the door when someone announced himself as a police officer and something about a search warrant.&nbsp; Skyler stood frozen, not sure what to do until the officer announced they would break the door down if they had to, making her feel as though she had no choice but to open it.&nbsp; 

Before opening the door she picked up Hunter, who had followed her.&nbsp; As she stood to the side of the open door, the officer handed her a piece of paper while other officers walked past her, throwing things all over the house.&nbsp; They were totally destroying everything even though she was begging them to stop.&nbsp; It seemed to her they were almost enjoying it.&nbsp; 

Hunter began to cry as Skyler tried calming him down.&nbsp; After deciding there was nothing she could do she returned to the kitchen with the original officer following her.&nbsp; She poured cereal in front of the other two boys while Hunter clung tightly to her.&nbsp; After trying to put him on a chair and being unsuccessful in getting him to let go, she sat down with him on her lap, pouring cereal onto the table so he could pick it up while he sat on her.

�Where&#8217;s my husband?�&nbsp; 
�Jail.�&nbsp; 
�What&#8217;d he do?�&nbsp; 
�Drugs.�&nbsp; 
�Drugs?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t understand; he was doing drugs?�&nbsp; 
�You know he was selling drugs,� The officer claimed, looking down at her.
�No I didn&#8217;t!�&nbsp; Skyler protested, tears coming to her eyes as she thought about losing her babies.
�You really expect me to believe you knew absolutely nothing?�&nbsp; 
�She knew absolutely nothing,� Chelsea stated from behind him.
�Officer Gold?�&nbsp; Skyler asked, glancing around him.
�Hello Sky, your neck looks painful,� Chelsea remarked.
�It&#8217;ll be okay,� she replied, touching her hand to it.&nbsp; �Has he talked to a lawyer yet?�&nbsp; 
�I think he is right now.�&nbsp; 
�He&#8217;s gonna be so angry when he gets home and sees the house.�&nbsp; 
�You think he&#8217;s getting out?�&nbsp; The officer laughed.
�I know he will, everybody loves Tyler,� Skyler uttered, hugging Hunter.
�Not this time Sky,� Chelsea stated.
�He&#8217;ll be home soon, I know he will.�&nbsp; 
�There&#8217;s something else that they&#8217;re looking for too Sky.�&nbsp; 
�What?� she asked, putting more cereal out for the boys.&nbsp; 
�A certain pair of boots.�&nbsp; 
�Tyler took a pair of his boots out to the trash yesterday; he said the soles were wrecked from some gasoline or something.�&nbsp; 
�Shit!�&nbsp; The officer shouted, running out of the room.
�What&#8217;re the boots from?�&nbsp; Skyler asked.
�We have some prints from some boots.�&nbsp; 
�Was somebody hurt?�&nbsp; 
�Very badly.�&nbsp; 
��&nbsp; I wonder how long it&#8217;ll be before he comes home,� Skyler said dazedly, knowing Tyler would never be that sloppy if he hurt someone badly.
 �Well, we caught him dead to rights in the drug deal,� Chelsea insisted.
�I&#8217;m never gonna be able to clean this house before he gets home.�&nbsp; 
�Why don&#8217;t you pack up the boys?�&nbsp; Chelsea suggested.&nbsp; �Come stay at my house.&nbsp; What&#8217;s safer than staying with a cop?�&nbsp; 
�You wouldn&#8217;t be safe if you took any of us to your house.�&nbsp; 
�You seriously need to think about getting out of here.�&nbsp; 
�No she doesn&#8217;t,� Tyler barked from behind her, �but you people do,� he added, walking over to Skyler who was still looking down.
�I&#8217;m not leaving your wife here with you; she doesn&#8217;t need to be hurt anymore.�&nbsp; 
�I didn&#8217;t hurt her, she&#8217;s just accident prone� take her, but my boys stay with me,� Tyler stated, not meaning any of it.
�No!&nbsp; Tyler, I love you, I wanna stay!&nbsp; Tyler wouldn&#8217;t hurt me, he loves me!�&nbsp; Skyler shouted, jumping up as she adjusted Hunter on her hip before going to Tyler&#8217;s open arms.
�There ya go, she doesn&#8217;t wanna go with you, she loves me and now I think you should all leave my home.�&nbsp; 
�How exactly d&#8217;you do it, making everyone believe your lies?�&nbsp; Chelsea asked.
�I don&#8217;t lie; I&#8217;m innocent as a newborn babe.�&nbsp; 
�Yeah, I can see that.&nbsp; I&#8217;m gonna be looking over your shoulder, so you better watch yourself very closely.�&nbsp; 
�Are you really watching me, or you just trying to get into my wife&#8217;s pants?�&nbsp; Tyler whispered.
�Tyler!&nbsp; Please stop.�&nbsp; 
�You think maybe she&#8217;s thinking about getting into yours?�&nbsp; 
�That&#8217;s not true Tyler, you know it&#8217;s not,� Skyler protested.
�Someday soon, everything&#8217;s gonna catch up to you and I just hope I&#8217;m there to see it.�&nbsp; 
�Not gonna happen since there&#8217;s nothing to catch up with me girly.�&nbsp; 
�Keep it up and I&#8217;ll haul you in just for the fun of it,� Chelsea smiled back.
�You must want my wife something fierce,� he laughed.

Chelsea gave Tyler a look of disgust as she shook her head at him just before the other officer walked into the house with the boots in a bag.&nbsp; He had a great smile on his face as he looked at Tyler to tell him he was going down.

�I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about,� Tyler insisted.
�Yeah, you go ahead and say these aren&#8217;t your boots,� the officer laughed.&nbsp; �You probably don&#8217;t know about a little thing called DNA.�&nbsp; 
�Those aren&#8217;t my boots, but what&#8217;s that bleach smell?�&nbsp; Tyler asked, smiling.

The officer wasn&#8217;t looking as sure of his evidence as Tyler escorted the entire crew of police out of the house.&nbsp; 

Chelsea and Matt went back to their patrol car as the rest of the team drove away.

�That guy just bugs me,� Chelsea stated, staring at the house.&nbsp; �I think I will ask you to help me now Matt.�&nbsp; 
�Is he right Chels?�&nbsp; 
�Right about what?!�&nbsp; She exclaimed, looking at him.
�About you wanting his wife.�&nbsp; 
�You have got to be kidding?!&nbsp; That guy is such an ass and one of these times when we come to this house, we&#8217;re gonna have three boys with no parents.&nbsp; I just wanna know what he does and how he gets away with it.&nbsp; I could&#8217;ve sworn we had him dead to rights on the drugs, so how&#8217;d he get out so quick?&nbsp; What&#8217;s he got goin&#8217; on?&nbsp; I just wanna know about his past and see if we can&#8217;t nail him on something.&nbsp; I wanna get her and those children outta that house.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t tell you about when I went to see her in the hospital, but��&nbsp; 
�You did what?!&nbsp; Why&#8217;d you do that?�&nbsp; 
�I just wanted to see if there was anything she could tell me that might help her.&nbsp; There really wasn&#8217;t though and I know she doesn&#8217;t believe that I can actually help her, but I&#8217;d like to try.�&nbsp; 
�Well, the bugs are planted now so just wait and see.�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t think this guy is so stupid to even say what he does to his wife.&nbsp; I&#8217;m almost positive he just sees her as property and not any sorta partner.&nbsp; Did you see that camera setup he has in there?&nbsp; He obviously doesn&#8217;t trust her.�&nbsp; 
�So what d&#8217;ya want me to do?�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t know, maybe talk to that girl that likes you and see if she can find any information on the computer somewhere, anything to point me in the right direction?&nbsp; Maybe have her check into the disappearance of a David Klasp while you&#8217;re at it?�&nbsp; 
�Shit Chels!&nbsp; Fine, I&#8217;ll do it for you, but you need to call Val and tell her what I&#8217;m doing because the last time I asked her for information she called and asked me out.�&nbsp; 
�What&#8217;d Val say?�&nbsp; 
�Let&#8217;s just say that I don&#8217;t even care to remember how many mornings I woke up to the girls staring at me because they wanted to sit on the couch and watch cartoons,� Matt stated as Chelsea began laughing.
�I&#8217;ll stop over after work and talk to her personally,� Chelsea promised as Matt scratched his chin.

Skyler was hurrying the boys into their room putting some cereal onto a sheet of paper for them to pick up and eat.&nbsp; Pulling the door shut behind her, she began cleaning the house until Tyler grabbed her by the hair, dragging her into the kitchen and bending her over the table before pulling her sweats down.&nbsp; 

The entire process of almost going to jail had actually turned Tyler on.&nbsp; He felt exhilarated from the entire experience and the fact that the lawyer had gotten him out of there so quickly, not even having to go to court was what he loved that the most.&nbsp; 

He slammed Skyler&#8217;s head onto the table as he roughly rammed his cock into her ass, orgasming almost immediately.&nbsp; When it was over, Skyler was free to pull her sweats back, returning to her cleaning while Tyler walked around Skyler, making her nervous as he continued smiling at her.

�I just have one question for you sweetums,� Tyler whispered.
�What?�&nbsp; 
�Who d&#8217;you want Hunter and Tristan to go to after they find your body?�&nbsp; 
�Mom.�&nbsp; 
�You don&#8217;t even wanna know why I&#8217;m asking?�&nbsp; 
�You have your son, you don&#8217;t need me anymore.�&nbsp; 
�That&#8217;s not it you stupid bitch!�&nbsp; Tyler rasped in a whisper.&nbsp; �How the fuck did they know to look in the garbage?�&nbsp; 
�They asked about boots, I couldn&#8217;t lie!�&nbsp; Skyler protested in a loud whisper.
�Want me to back up the tape and see if that&#8217;s what really happened?�&nbsp; 
�Go ahead.�&nbsp; 
�You knew?�&nbsp; 
�Do I fucking look stupid?&nbsp; I knew something was there when I couldn&#8217;t even go piss without you knowing about it.�&nbsp; 
�Why have you really hung around all this time?�&nbsp; 
�Now who&#8217;s the fucking moron?�&nbsp; Skyler asked before his fist connected with her head.
�Just answer the fucking question!�&nbsp; 
�You&#8217;re gonna kill me anyway so I want questions answered first.&nbsp; What&#8217;d you do to David?�&nbsp; 
�You want me to tell you things, because you seriously think I&#8217;m gonna kill you?�&nbsp; 
�I always thought you&#8217;d lose interest sooner, I guess I would&#8217;ve had to name every single son Tyler, to keep you actually believing that I ever fell in love with you!&nbsp; Tyler, you raped me and since Little Tyler was born, you haven&#8217;t been happy unless you&#8217;re raping me.&nbsp; When you were actually good to me and the boys, I thought I might be able to fall in love with you, but that was never good enough for you, you have to be hurting me now to be happy.&nbsp; What&#8217;s gonna happen to Little Tyler if I&#8217;m dead?&nbsp; What&#8217;s gonna happen when you lose interest in him too, or when he makes you angry?�&nbsp; 
�So, as long as I have you around, I don&#8217;t have to hurt them; is that what you&#8217;re saying?�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t think so, you&#8217;ve already hurt them, just not beyond repair, I hope.&nbsp; I just wanted to know how many bodies you actually think you can get away with getting rid of?�&nbsp; 
�You&#8217;ve got quite a mouth on you when you don&#8217;t give a shit.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m just so fucking sick how you treat me, us.&nbsp; Your sons&#8217;re gonna hate you so much when they&#8217;re older and I don&#8217;t even care anymore.&nbsp; Like mom told me, you made your bed.&nbsp; Why don&#8217;t you just stop talking and do it already?&nbsp; Just fucking do it Tyler!�&nbsp; Skyler screamed, hitting him in the chest with both fists.

Tyler was looking at her the same way he looked at her before Little Tyler was born.&nbsp; He had forgotten after so long that Skyler actually use to have a personality and he was getting turned on again.&nbsp; He wanted her like he used to want her, when he actually felt she was falling in love with him.&nbsp; 

Skyler backed away from Tyler as he began moving towards her.

�It&#8217;s okay Skyler, I&#8217;m not gonna hurt you, really.�&nbsp; 
�Is this a trick?�&nbsp; 
�No, no trick.&nbsp; Can we just try this, please?�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m such a fucking moron.�&nbsp; 

She stared at him, but went to him anyway, no matter what, he was still her husband.&nbsp; As he held her, they kissed until Tyler picked her up.&nbsp; Carrying Skyler into the bedroom, Tyler sat her on a clean spot before pushing the drawers onto the floor.&nbsp; They began kissing again and slowly took off each other&#8217;s shirts, as Skyler began rolling and tweaking Tyler&#8217;s nipples, the way she knew he liked.&nbsp; He, in return, began tweaking her nipples until they were both gasping and stripping off each other&#8217;s pants.&nbsp; 

Skyler automatically moved her head down, kissing and licking Tyler&#8217;s shaft, sucking his balls as he guided her pussy over his face.&nbsp; He hadn&#8217;t touched her that way in so long that she could feel her excitement dribble down the inside of her leg.&nbsp; Tyler even dragged his tongue through the dribbles as she went to work on his penis, drawing it into her mouth without any troubles after first cleaning off the small dribble of pre-cum.&nbsp; Skyler had to focus as she felt Tyler&#8217;s tongue traveling into her vagina and through her vulva up to her clit, circling around it and moving back down to start all over again.&nbsp; 

When Tyler knew he was about to cum, he repositioned them both, looking Skyler in the eyes as he lined up his penis with her vagina, gliding inside her easily.&nbsp; 

It had been so long for Skyler that she didn&#8217;t need anything more than Tyler slapping his pubes against her clit to cause her orgasm to explode as she watched him smile when he began to orgasm with her. 
 
Skyler couldn&#8217;t believe how horny she had actually been as Tyler lay beside her, taking her into his arms.

�See, no tricks.�&nbsp; 
�That was actually really nice Tyler.&nbsp; It&#8217;s been a while since it was that nice.�&nbsp; 
�It was pretty nice, I guess I missed it too,� he admitted.&nbsp; �I need a smoke, I think I&#8217;m gonna take Tyler outside while you clean up.�&nbsp; 
�But you&#8217;re not taking Hunter or Tristan?�&nbsp; 
�They&#8217;re your responsibility.�&nbsp; 
�I thought all three were our responsibility?�&nbsp; Skyler asked, getting out of bed and walking over to where Tyler had moved to put his clothes back on.

Tyler had about all he could take of the sentimentality, pulling back his fist before letting it connect with the side of Skyler&#8217;s head. 

�You son-of-a-bitch!&nbsp; I&#8217;m so sick of you using me as a punching bag!�&nbsp; Skyler screamed, flying at Tyler.

Tyler, seeing her coming, grabbed both of her fists with one hand as she tried hitting him.&nbsp; He slapped her across the face while he laughed.&nbsp; 

Skyler broke one hand loose, punching him in the mouth, making him stop laughing as he wiped the little trickle of blood from his lip.&nbsp; He was on top of her in seconds, flipping her over before sodomizing her as he punched her in the back of the head.&nbsp; Tyler was slamming, hard into her ass as he pushed her face into the carpet.&nbsp; Since he had just cum, he managed to keep up the pace for a while before another orgasm hit.

When he finally pulled his limp penis from her ass, Skyler slowly curled into a ball on the floor.&nbsp; 

�I hate you so much,� Skyler cried.&nbsp; �I actually thought you were trying!&nbsp; You&#8217;re such a bastard!�&nbsp; 
�I love you too doll.&nbsp; Make sure Tyler&#8217;s diaper is changed before I take him out.�&nbsp; 
�Do it yourself!�&nbsp; 
�Listen to me now!�&nbsp; Tyler roared, lifting her by the throat.&nbsp; �You belong to me, you&#8217;ll always belong to me and there&#8217;s not a fucking thing you can do about it and you know why, so unless you want things changing immediately, you better fuckin&#8217; wise up and start doing what I tell you to do!&nbsp; Am I making myself clear?�&nbsp; Tyler asked, gritting his teeth.
�You made yourself clear the first time you raped me,� Skyler rasped.
�Then why d&#8217;you keep fucking with me?�&nbsp; 
�Because you keep cutting off my oxygen; clouds my judgement,� Skyler gasped as Tyler dropped her and laughed.
�That was funny, now go change my son&#8217;s diaper so I can take him out,� Tyler ordered.
�Like I said before, do it yourself.�&nbsp; 

Tyler went to Skyler, grabbed her by the hair and carried her on her tiptoes to the boy&#8217;s bedroom door, smashing her head against it.

�I&#8217;m getting dressed so just fucking do what you&#8217;re told or next it&#8217;s one of the two boys, keep it up and it&#8217;s your choice!�&nbsp; 
�I told you before, you hurt my babies, and you might as well kill me.�&nbsp; 
�You&#8217;d sacrifice two for one?�&nbsp; 
�I sacrificed all my babies the day I walked with you to that car; I just hope someday they all forgive me for making them live with a twisted monster like you.�&nbsp; 
�Maybe I am a monster, but no matter what I am, I&#8217;m all you got and you need to start remembering that.�&nbsp; 
�What is it about me Tyler?&nbsp; Why d&#8217;you need me so bad?&nbsp; Why&#8217;re you so obsessed with me?�&nbsp; 

Skyler asked him as he sat down, pulling her into him and wrapping his arms around her.

�Ninth grade I noticed you, you were in the eighth grade then and you were talking to a whole group of kids.&nbsp; You never singled out just a few close friends, it was like everyone was your friend and right then I knew you were special and I had to have you.&nbsp; I just knew right then that I wanted you and now I have you and no matter how hard you try, you&#8217;ll never be rid of me.�&nbsp; 
�You took away so much happiness, but as long as I still have my babies, I guess in a sick way you gave me my life.�&nbsp; 
�Good, now go put a clean diaper on my son before I have to kick the shit outta you again.�&nbsp; 
�Sure would be nice if you could make a tender moment last longer than three seconds,� Skyler said, trying to move.
�Sure would be nice if you&#8217;d stop lippin&#8217; off to me,� Tyler returned, his arms squeezing tighter.
�Tyler, you&#8217;re hurting me, I&#8217;m going, please just let me go.�&nbsp; 
�Fuckin&#8217; go and get my son ready to go outside,� he said, squeezing a little tighter before letting her go.&nbsp; �Hopefully this ends any future discussions,� he added patting her hard on the head.

As Tyler walked into the bedroom to finish getting dressed, Skyler went into the living room to grab her robe from the laundry basket before going in to change little Tyler&#8217;s diaper.&nbsp; 

While little Tyler crawled around on the floor, she took care of Tristan and Hunter.&nbsp; Hunter was almost potty trained, but he couldn&#8217;t concentrate when there was fighting in the house, which, as of late, meant he couldn&#8217;t concentrate at all.&nbsp; 

Skyler made the mistake of calling little Tyler, Logan as she was pulling him back in the door and the next thing she knew, she was being smashed into the wall with Tyler&#8217;s hand clamping tightly around her throat.

�What&#8217;s his name?�&nbsp; He asked, calmly at first.
�Tyler.�&nbsp; 
�Say it again!�&nbsp; He screamed.
�Tyler, Tyler!�&nbsp; She cried as the boys all began crying.
�Don&#8217;t you ever let me hear you call him anything else!&nbsp; Shut those two bastards up!�&nbsp; Tyler shouted, dropping her to picked up little Tyler and taking him away.

Skyler crawled over to Hunter and Tristan, trying to calm them down, telling them both that everything was okay and daddy didn&#8217;t mean to get so angry.

Chapter 8

Over the next month or so, Skyler fell back into the routine she had lived since Little Tyler had been born.&nbsp; She was convinced that his one nice moment was all Tyler had in him.&nbsp; It was pretty much business as usual with slaps and rapes.&nbsp; 

The boys were all napping one day and after Skyler had been sodomized again, she began staring at Tyler while the questions started entering her mind.

�Is it true, what they said about the drugs?�&nbsp; 
�Why d&#8217;you wanna push me?&nbsp; I told you a hundred times to worry about the boys, the house, making me happy and nothing else.&nbsp; Why d&#8217;you like to piss me off?�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m not trying to piss you off, I&#8217;m just trying to guess when they&#8217;re gonna rip our house apart again, and why don&#8217;t we get the Echo anymore?&nbsp; Why&#8217;d you cancel it right after you let me read daddy&#8217;s obituary?&nbsp; Why haven&#8217;t they found David yet?&nbsp; And how did you get Nikki in the position to hang herself and Josh, how did you make him unconscious enough so it looked like he killed himself and how&#8217;d you trick Jenny into going anywhere with you and who else do they think you killed?�&nbsp; 
�That&#8217;s it!&nbsp; Hunter&#8217;s getting a whack!�&nbsp; Tyler shouted, standing up.

Skyler jumped in front of Tyler, pushing her hands against his chest as she began apologizing to him, but he threw her aside.&nbsp; She started begging him again, telling him she would do anything, just don&#8217;t touch the boys at all, he smiled at her, leaving no questions in her mind about what he wanted.&nbsp; 

She had to work doubly hard at not throwing up, since she had been feeling slightly nauseated lately, doubled by the fact that he had just had his penis up her ass, but Skyler gave him the best blowjob ever, up to that point.&nbsp; The fear that he might actually hurt Hunter helped her through it.

One month later, Skyler was in the bedroom playing with the boys, while Tyler was watching the news when he was suddenly running into the bedroom looking frantic as he began throwing things into a bag for little Tyler.

�What&#8217;s going on?�&nbsp; 
�Put them two in the crib, we&#8217;re leaving.�&nbsp; 
�No!&nbsp; I&#8217;m not leaving my boys!�&nbsp; 

Tyler stopped what he was doing long enough to punch Skyler directly in the mouth, splitting her lip wide open.&nbsp; She screamed as the blood flew and her hand flew to her mouth.

�I told you to move, now move your ass!�&nbsp; 
�Fuck you!&nbsp; I&#8217;m not leaving my babies anywhere!�&nbsp; Skyler shouted, standing her ground.&nbsp; 

He grabbed little Tyler out of the crib, walking over to Skyler and promptly smashed her head into the wall until she was only semiconscious.&nbsp; 

She could feel herself being half drug, half carried to the car as she heard Hunter, Tristan and little Tyler all crying.&nbsp; She wanted to get to Hunter and Tristan, but she lost consciousness completely, not coming to until she felt herself being pulled out of the car and saw the police lights flashing around her.

Tyler took Skyler and little Tyler out of the bedroom while Hunter stayed on the mattress holding onto Tristan so their father wouldn&#8217;t hurt him.&nbsp; As soon as the door was pulled closed, both boys began to cry for their mother as they clung to each other.&nbsp; 

At the car, Tyler put little Tyler into his car seat before lifting Skyler into the front seat.&nbsp; As he began to drive, he pulled Skyler close to him, afraid to let her go.&nbsp; He hadn&#8217;t gone far before the police caught up to them and as soon as he realized he was boxed in, he pulled over, opening the door and throwing himself onto the pavement.&nbsp; 

As Tyler was being cuffed and having his rights read, he never took his eyes off Skyler as the ambulance crew was lifting her onto the stretcher.&nbsp; He memorized the face of the officer who had picked up his son, as well as the crew who had their hands all over his wife.

At the request of his partner Chelsea Gold, Matt Scheffield was along on the arrest to make sure Skyler and the little boy were treated well.&nbsp; 

Matt had received information about the missing boy, organizing a small search party to try and locate David Klasp.&nbsp; It took some time, but eventually they found him partially buried in a small, swampy area and along with his remains was the evidence that Tyler Lasko was the last person with him before he died.&nbsp; 

Officer Matt Scheffield was tall and extremely handsome with his blonde hair and blue eyes, but he always had to promise his wife that Chelsea had never come on to him.&nbsp; Val Scheffield thought for sure Chelsea saved his life because she was in love with her husband, until the day she had gone to talk to Chelsea face-to-face.&nbsp; Chelsea laughed as she assured Val that if she were to have the hots for anyone, it would be Val and not Matt she would be hitting on.&nbsp; From that day on, Val and Chelsea were the best of friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

With his first impression, Matt hadn&#8217;t thought Tyler was too bad of a guy, other than being a little too quick to flair, but as he began listening to the surveillance tapes, he realized the guy had completely pulled the wool over his eyes.&nbsp; 

Matt was a family man himself with a wonderful wife and three daughters all under the age of seven and as he listened to the tapes, he could picture his daughters in Skyler&#8217;s position.&nbsp; It made him angry to believe that any man could treat a woman the way Tyler did and he was angry that any man would openly prefer one child over another.&nbsp; He understood that all parents were capable of having their favorites, that one child who brightens your day the minute you see them, but to deny certain children and play favorites for one was just wrong in his book.&nbsp; 

Carrying little Tyler into the back of the ambulance, Matt noticed the boy was calming down as long as he could see his mother.&nbsp; 

As Skyler began waking up in the hospital, she began calling for her boys.&nbsp; Upon opening her eyes, she saw Chelsea standing beside the bed.

�Am I under arrest?�&nbsp; 
�No, you&#8217;ve been just as much of a victim as everyone else.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m not a victim; I know exactly what he&#8217;s capable of.�&nbsp; 
�Doing something against your will to keep the people you love safe, makes you a victim in my book.�&nbsp; 
�My boys, where&#8217;re my boys?�&nbsp; 
�They&#8217;re okay Sky; you need to stay in bed.�&nbsp; 
�No!&nbsp; I need my boys!�&nbsp; Skyler exclaimed, reaching for the tubes in her hand.
�What if I have them brought in here?�&nbsp; Chelsea asked, stopping Skyler from pulling out the tubes.
�Please?&nbsp; They have to be so scared and they need me.�&nbsp; 

Chelsea pushed the buzzer for a nurse and as the nurse entered the room, Chelsea went to her, whispering something before the nurse walked back out.

�She&#8217;ll bring all three of them in here; okay?�&nbsp; 
�Thank you.&nbsp; What happened?�&nbsp; Skyler asked.&nbsp; �What&#8217;d he finally get caught at?�&nbsp; 
�Murder.&nbsp; The boy from school was finally found.&nbsp; Tyler had a flight tag on his jacket from a flight to California the year before and apparently hadn&#8217;t noticed it was missing.&nbsp; When they found David, he was still holding onto the tag,� Chelsea explained.
�Poor David,� Skyler cried.&nbsp; �I knew he did something to him, but nobody saw Tyler leave the party, he just wasn&#8217;t there and then he was.&nbsp; God, I&#8217;m so sorry I talked to him.�&nbsp; 
�You can&#8217;t blame yourself, you didn&#8217;t know.�&nbsp; 
�Did they shoot him?�&nbsp; 
�No, but he&#8217;s going away for a long time.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;ll believe it when I see it,� Skyler mumbled.&nbsp; �I can&#8217;t even have a life as long as he&#8217;s still alive.�&nbsp; 
�Maybe if someone knows about the mess beforehand, it might not deter them,� Chelsea suggested.
�Nobody could ever understand the hold he has on me.&nbsp; Who could live with that?&nbsp; Plus three kids and a fourth on the way, but at least I&#8217;m free for a little while?�&nbsp; Skyler asked as Chelsea gave her a nod.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t know what to do now.�&nbsp; 
�I wasn&#8217;t sure you knew you were pregnant again.�&nbsp; 
�I knew, I&#8217;ve had to swallow my own vomit for the past two months.&nbsp; Tyler wouldn&#8217;t let me have any of the other girls and I wanted one so bad, so I couldn&#8217;t let him see I was getting sick.&nbsp; I was hoping that if he didn&#8217;t see any signs, he would let me keep her.�&nbsp; 
�Now you don&#8217;t need to worry so much.�&nbsp; 
�For a while anyway.�&nbsp; 

The cribs were coming down the hall and Skyler could hear Hunter calling for her.&nbsp; All three boys were hanging on the sides of their cribs crying.&nbsp; 

Skyler asked if someone could pull up the side rails and bring the boys to her.&nbsp; As soon as the boys were in bed with her, they stopped crying and fell asleep.&nbsp; 

Chelsea stared at the four of them in amazement.

�That was the most amazing thing I think I&#8217;ve ever seen,� Chelsea remarked.
�It&#8217;s the only way to keep them safe from their father,� Skyler whispered.
�What about when he&#8217;s busy with you?�&nbsp; 
�I think Hunter&#8217;s been taking over.�&nbsp; 
�Big responsibility for a little boy.�&nbsp; 
�Hopefully he&#8217;ll forgive me someday,� Skyler said, kissing Hunter&#8217;s head.
�I know you don&#8217;t really have anyplace to go and I can&#8217;t imagine you would want to stay in your house, so I was thinking you might wanna stay at my house,� Chelsea suggested.&nbsp; �There&#8217;s plenty of room and we could get a small wading pool for the boys.�&nbsp; 
�Hunter and Tristan haven&#8217;t ever played outside.�&nbsp; 
�I know, when we searched your house, we planted some bugs around.&nbsp; He really kept you in the dark about everything, didn&#8217;t he?�&nbsp; 
�You heard everything?�&nbsp; Skyler asked, slightly embarrassed.
�Yeah, you&#8217;re pretty tough, ever thought about being a cop?�&nbsp; 
�No, I&#8217;d cave as soon as they threatened my family,� Skyler said with a sad smile, kissing Hunter on the head again.&nbsp; �I hope this doesn&#8217;t haunt him too long,� she repeated.&nbsp; �That&#8217;s really nice of you, but why would you do that?�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t know, I just want to I guess.�&nbsp; 
�I can&#8217;t pay you any money, I could clean your house and cook is about all.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m not expecting you to do anything; I&#8217;m just trying to help you out.�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t know what to say.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know what else to do, so thank you very much.�&nbsp; 
�I should thank you, that house gets pretty lonely and I think three boys could pep things up a bit.�&nbsp; 
�You said you had bugs around the house.&nbsp; You know my boys don&#8217;t make noise, or run around, except little Tyler.�&nbsp; 
�Well, maybe with the constraints gone, they might loosen up a little, but would you mind if we called him Logan?�&nbsp; 
�Thank you,� Skyler said, fighting the tears.&nbsp; �Am I gonna have to see him at all?�&nbsp; 
�Not unless you want to.�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t know, I might need to I guess, just to cover myself.&nbsp; How would I arrange that?�&nbsp; 
�Are you sure?�&nbsp; 
�The only thing I don&#8217;t know is if I should take Logan with me.�&nbsp; 
�Well, I don&#8217;t think you should go until you&#8217;re a little healthier to begin with, but I&#8217;ll find out everything else by then, okay.�&nbsp; 
�You&#8217;re very sweet, thank you.&nbsp; How long were Hunter and Tristan alone?&nbsp; I know he drug me to the car after he knocked me out.&nbsp; I was trying to stay conscious, but it wasn&#8217;t working.�&nbsp; 
�Only about 10 minutes.&nbsp; We got to the house as soon as we heard what was happening.�&nbsp; 
�Did you go to them yourself?�&nbsp; 
�I was there, yeah.&nbsp; I know they don&#8217;t know me, but I thought I might be able to help a little bit since you did introduce us.&nbsp; They were still frightened, but they came right to me and we brought them here right after since we knew you&#8217;d be brought here.�&nbsp; 
�You must be an angel.�&nbsp; 
�No, I&#8217;m not an angel just someone who cares.�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t know how I can ever thank you.�&nbsp; 
�Just be happy.�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t think I remember how.�&nbsp; 
�It&#8217;ll come in time.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m not so much worried about me as I am about them.&nbsp; I gave up on me a long time ago.�&nbsp; 
�With any luck that&#8217;ll change too.&nbsp; By the looks of them right now it seems to me they pretty much feed off of the way you&#8217;re feeling,� Chelsea observed.
�Tyler likes things quiet and this just always seemed to work.�&nbsp; 
�Just so you know, I love noise.� 

Chapter 9

Skyler and the boys walked into Chelsea&#8217;s house a few days later.&nbsp; It was so big and bright with the open blinds and the sliding doors that it was almost overwhelming.&nbsp; 

Chelsea could see that Skyler and the boys were going to need to move slowly, so she pulled some of the blinds closed, making the house a little less bright.&nbsp; 

On a tour through the house, Skyler and the boys followed Chelsea.&nbsp; The boy&#8217;s room was huge, with two children&#8217;s beds and a crib.&nbsp; She knew they had shared a room and didn&#8217;t want to traumatize them by separating them too soon.&nbsp; 

Chelsea had even bought a baby gate so the boys wouldn&#8217;t get hurt if they woke up in the night.&nbsp; Immediately next to the boy&#8217;s room was Skyler&#8217;s room and she was amazed at the size of the bed alone.&nbsp; In the bathroom off her bedroom, was a whirlpool tub.&nbsp; Skyler needed to fight her tears as she became overwhelmed by Officer Gold&#8217;s kindness.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

She knew she wouldn&#8217;t be able to handle any tears, so Chelsea moved on to the guest room and the main bathroom before backtracking to her own bedroom, which looked similar to the one Skyler was in. 

In the corner of the living room was a toy box overflowing with toys.&nbsp; Some little push cars and lawnmowers, along with a variety of noisy toys were sitting alongside.&nbsp; Hunter began running to them until Skyler spoke his name.&nbsp; Hunter obediently moved back to his mother&#8217;s side as Chelsea touched her arm, softly telling her the toys were for all of the boys, if she didn&#8217;t mind they could all play.&nbsp; 

As Skyler put Tristan down, Chelsea put Logan down while Skyler told Hunter and Tristan it was okay to play with the toys and they were off like a shot to where Logan was already playing.&nbsp; 

It brought Chelsea a great amount of joy to see Skyler and the boys all playing with the toys.&nbsp; They had pulled everything out of the toy box in less than 10 minutes.&nbsp; After standing and watching the four of them, Chelsea joined in to play with them too.&nbsp; 

Skyler couldn&#8217;t believe how happy she felt, positive she would never live long enough to be happy again.&nbsp; 

For dinner, Chelsea ordered three different kinds of pizza.&nbsp; Skyler hadn&#8217;t had pizza since she was 16 and neither Hunter nor Tristan had ever had it.&nbsp; Whenever Tyler brought home pizza, he would never let them have any, only little Tyler.&nbsp; Skyler didn&#8217;t feel she could share any of this with Chelsea yet, although she was sure she suspected when Hunter and Tristan looked at their mother for approval before touching theirs.&nbsp; 

Once the boys had baths and were tucked in, she and Chelsea enjoyed a beer, some television and some conversation.&nbsp; 

�I haven&#8217;t had a beer since I was 16.&nbsp; One isn&#8217;t gonna hurt the baby; is it?�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m almost positive that one beer won&#8217;t hurt the baby,� Chelsea assured her.&nbsp; �So what were you like at 16?�&nbsp; 
�Happy, for some of it at least.&nbsp; I never really had any close friends because I liked to think that everybody was my friend and I pretty much got along with everyone, including Tyler,� Skyler laughed.
�So he wasn&#8217;t always the way he is now?�&nbsp; 
�Oh, I&#8217;m sure he was; I just didn&#8217;t know it then.&nbsp; I guess he must&#8217;ve found out about me some how, because he asked to talk to me alone, so I followed him and he cried when told me he was gay before asking me if we could pretend we were going out for a little while, so it might throw everybody off, but then he started acting different and I tried pulling away from him, but he&#8217;d show up at my house to watch movies with us and stuff.&nbsp; My parents and my little sister loved him, but the day I told him I didn&#8217;t wanna pretend anymore and that I&#8217;d just take my chances was the day it all went to hell.&nbsp; We were at a party when I was talking to David and when he excused himself to go to the bathroom; I went over to a big group of kids and got in on the conversation.&nbsp; Tyler pulled me right out of the group after I had just told them I broke up with him and as he was dragging me to his car he punched me in the head.&nbsp; As I was yelling at him in the car, he smashed my head into the side window and it was pretty much over by then.&nbsp; He took me to his basement apartment, threw around a lot of threats and then he raped me.&nbsp; That same night he killed my cat and I knew he was serious.&nbsp; I was stuck after that since I knew my little sister would go with him if he wanted her to and I couldn&#8217;t take that chance, I had to do what he said,� Skyler explained, nervously peeling her beer label.
�Sounds like a helluva ride.�&nbsp; 
�A helluva ride on four flat tires,� Skyler laughed, cynically.
�I think it&#8217;s great that you can still laugh at all.�&nbsp; 
�It&#8217;s either laugh or spend all my time crying and that wouldn&#8217;t solve anything.&nbsp; What about you at 16?�&nbsp; Skyler asked, desperately wanting to change the subject.
�I was scary at 16, purple hair and I was dating a guy who rode a Harley.&nbsp; My mother never seemed too worried about what I was doing since she knew I wanted to be a cop, so she just let me be a teenager.&nbsp; We both almost died when she had me and then I saw my dad get shot when I was around seven.&nbsp; He was a drug dealer and the fool took me with him on a deal, but I watched the cop give him every opportunity to give himself up; then when the shooting started and I saw my dad fall, the same cop ran to me to keep me from getting shot.&nbsp; That was when I wanted to be a cop, so I never really got into too much trouble.&nbsp; Mostly just color to my hair and some body piercings.�&nbsp; 
�And whatever happened to the biker?�&nbsp; 
�He was just a phase; I knew I was into women when I was nine.�&nbsp; 
�Really?&nbsp; Did your mother know?�&nbsp; 
�I told her when I knew for sure, that&#8217;s why she wasn&#8217;t too worried about me and the biker,� Chelsea said as she and Skyler laughed.
�Sounds like some fun teenage years.�&nbsp; 
�It wasn&#8217;t too bad� you look exhausted.�&nbsp; 
�I think that beer got to me.�&nbsp; 
�C&#8217;mon, I&#8217;ll show you how the monitor works.�&nbsp; 

Chelsea showed Skyler the monitor buttons and volume so she could relax and sleep until one of the boys fussed or woke up.&nbsp; 

She even had clothes and pajamas for Skyler, who was feeling so emotional right then, that she hugged Chelsea, crying as she thanked her over and over again.&nbsp; 

The thought of being able to sleep in pajamas made her happier than she had ever thought it would.&nbsp; Skyler was also looking forward to being able to move around in bed without being physically restrained.&nbsp; 

That night was the best night&#8217;s sleep she had gotten in the longest time, at least until the screaming began.&nbsp; Skyler moved quickly so whoever was making the fuss wouldn&#8217;t wake up Chelsea.&nbsp; 

By the time she got to the boy&#8217;s room, they were all awake.&nbsp; Both Hunter and Tristan were by the crib trying to quiet Logan down by holding his hand through the bars.&nbsp; 

Skyler opened the gate, slipping into the room and lifting Logan out of the crib.&nbsp; She looked over at Hunter&#8217;s bed seeing two pillows on it, as Logan began to quiet down.

�Did you get scared Tristan?�&nbsp; Skyler asked as Tristan nodded.&nbsp; �Its okay sweetie, you don&#8217;t have to be afraid here.�&nbsp; 
�Its okay mommy, I missed him,� Hunter explained.
�You&#8217;re a good, big brother; you&#8217;re both good, big brothers.�&nbsp; 
�Someone have a bad dream?�&nbsp; Chelsea asked from the doorway, the boys quickly clinging to their mother.
�What&#8217;s this?&nbsp; You boys like Officer Gold, remember?&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry we woke you, we&#8217;ll try and be quieter.�&nbsp; 
�Nonsense!&nbsp; Anyone feel like having some milk and a cookie with me?�&nbsp; 

The boys smiled, looking up at their mother, not moving until Skyler gave her okay.&nbsp; 

As Chelsea led the way, she yelled all the way through the house and after glancing at their smiling mother, the two older boys followed, screaming to the top of their lungs.&nbsp; Skyler was bouncing Logan along as he began shouting too. 
 
They all had milk and one cookie before brushing their teeth again and heading back to bed.&nbsp; 

On the way back to the bedroom, Chelsea suggested that if it was okay with Skyler, maybe the boys could sleep in bed with her until they felt more comfortable.&nbsp; Skyler smiled at Chelsea before thanking her again.&nbsp; 

Skyler and the boys slept through the night after that.

Actually, Skyler woke up angry the next morning when Logan hit her in the face.&nbsp; She caught hold of his hand as he was about to hit her a second time.

�Tyler Logan Lasko, that&#8217;s naughty, you hear me?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t ever want you to do that again!&nbsp; Understand?�&nbsp; Skyler scolded Logan as he began to cry.

Skyler sat up, holding out her arms as all three boys crawled onto her.&nbsp; Logan was still crying until Hunter told him it was quiet time.&nbsp; 

Five minutes later there was a knock at the door and Chelsea walked in as soon as Skyler said it was okay.&nbsp; 

�Quiet time?&nbsp; Want me to leave?�&nbsp; 
�Logan just hit me in the face and I was trying to explain to him that doing that is naughty.�&nbsp; 

Logan&#8217;s lip began to quiver again as he put his arms around his mother&#8217;s neck, giving her a kiss.&nbsp; 

�That was sweet baby,� Skyler said, making Logan smile.
�Well, when you&#8217;re ready to get up, there&#8217;s someone out here who wants to meet you all.�&nbsp; 
�We could barely handle meeting you,� Skyler stated, looking down and speaking much lower.
�Is it too much?�&nbsp; Chelsea asked, walking over to sit on the edge of the bed.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s just my mother.&nbsp; She just lives a few doors down and she comes over a lot, but I can ask her to come back if you&#8217;re not ready.�&nbsp; 
�No, god no!&nbsp; I would never ask you to do that.&nbsp; I just meant we could ��&nbsp; 
�Don&#8217;t even finish that, I want you to think of this as your home too while you&#8217;re here.&nbsp; She brought over some fresh baked chocolate chip cookies,� Chelsea announced, the boys looking longingly at their mother.
�Before breakfast?�&nbsp; 
�And brownies.�&nbsp; 
��&nbsp; With nuts?�&nbsp; Skyler asked, slowly raising her head to look directly at Chelsea for the first time.
�Are there any other kind?�&nbsp; 
�I haven&#8217;t had a brownie in seven years; we&#8217;d love to meet your mother.� 

Once the kids were taken care of, Skyler put on a jogging suit she found in the closet before picking up Logan while Hunter and Tristan followed her into the kitchen.&nbsp; 

Skyler and the kids looked down as the boys grabbed hold of their mother&#8217;s legs and Logan buried his head into her shoulder.

Frannie Gold was a sweet woman, a lot like Chelsea.&nbsp; She looked like Chelsea, only a little heavier and her hair was auburn with wisps of silver throughout.&nbsp; She had blue eyes, exactly like Chelsea&#8217;s one blue eye, but she never said a word until she had trays of sweets and milk glasses filled all around the table.&nbsp; 

Logan and Tristan had sippy cups, but she thought Hunter should have a big boy glass.&nbsp; Skyler protested, not knowing if he would spill, but Frannie didn&#8217;t see what the big deal would be if he did.&nbsp; 

With the cookies and brownies taunting them all, Frannie began taking bowls of oatmeal to the table.&nbsp; There wasn&#8217;t a lot in them, but she let the boys know that they should finish the oatmeal first, before they had cookies.&nbsp; 

Skyler sat with both Tristan and Logan in highchairs off to her right, while Hunter was on her left.&nbsp; He was a pro at not spilling his food by then, but he had never used anything other than a sippy cup, Tyler wouldn&#8217;t allow it.&nbsp; The very first thing Hunter did was spill his milk before hopping off his chair and clinging to his mother.&nbsp; Skyler started apologizing for him while he apologized to her.&nbsp; 

Putting Hunter on her chair, Skyler rapidly moved to clean it up and as Chelsea walked over with toweling to help, Skyler dropped to the floor, apologizing as she leaned in beside her.&nbsp; Skyler began to shake uncontrollably as her hands had been drawn, automatically over her head while she continued apologizing.&nbsp; 

Hunter turned immediately to look the other way, which is what Skyler had always made him do, while Tristan and Logan looked down at their trays.&nbsp; Chelsea got to the floor, giving Skyler a hug as she felt her shaking.

�Sky, it&#8217;s okay, it was just spilled milk and nobody&#8217;s gonna hurt you here.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t have to be afraid right now, you&#8217;re safe here and nobody cares if the milk gets spilled,� Chelsea explained calmly.

Frannie had already finished cleaning up the milk and had a new glass filled and waiting for Hunter.&nbsp; While Frannie was handing Hunter a cookie, Skyler was beginning to calm down.&nbsp; 

She eventually managed to calm down enough to get off the floor and as she stood, she looked at Hunter and his brothers, wiping her eyes while Frannie finish feeding Tristan and Logan before handing each of them a cookie too.&nbsp; 

Skyler thanked Chelsea before helping Hunter back to his chair.&nbsp; He was extremely careful when he picked up the milk glass again.&nbsp; Skyler thanked Frannie for cleaning up the mess and feeding the boys and then she moved on to apologize for her behavior as Chelsea helped her back to her chair.

�You really need to try and relax.&nbsp; You&#8217;re fine here and if we spill something, we wipe it up, if we break something, we clean it up, but we don&#8217;t need to say I&#8217;m sorry more than once and nobody&#8217;s getting hit, ever.&nbsp; Okay?�&nbsp; Chelsea asked, looking around the table.

All Skyler could do was nod as she tried to make herself stop shaking.&nbsp; Hunter was nodding fiercely and smiling at everyone around the table as he shoved the rest of the cookie into his mouth.&nbsp; The other two were too busy shoving pieces of cookie into their mouths to be able to listen. 

Skyler finished her oatmeal, staring longingly at the plate of brownies before finishing her milk.

�I thought you wanted a brownie?�&nbsp; Chelsea asked.
�I do, but I&#8217;m full.&nbsp; Normally I have two pieces of toast to last me all day and that oatmeal filled me up.&nbsp; They look delicious though Mrs. Gold.�&nbsp; 
�Please call me Frannie.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;ll try.�&nbsp; 

As Skyler led the boys into the living room to play, Chelsea and Frannie took in coffee for the adults.&nbsp; While watching the boys play, Skyler smiled to see them looking so happy.&nbsp; 

Still the only one to play loudly was Logan.&nbsp; Hunter and Tristan would look around with fear in their eyes, waiting to be shouted at whenever Logan got loud.&nbsp; 

Chelsea went to the boys, whispering something in their ears and as she went back to her seat, suddenly Hunter and Tristan began playing loudly right along with Logan.&nbsp; They looked around as they shouted before looking at each other and smiling.&nbsp; After that, they were playing hard.

�What&#8217;d you say to them?�&nbsp; Skyler asked quietly.
�I told them that if they were as loud, or louder than their brother, they could have two cookies when they were finished playing.&nbsp; Was that okay?�&nbsp; Chelsea asked as an afterthought.
�Well, I don&#8217;t know your rules and I&#8217;ve never really had to give them any, other than to not make daddy angry, so whatever you think is best is fine.�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t wanna take over and make you feel like you&#8217;re in the same situation you just left, so maybe the next time I have an idea, how about if I discuss it with you first?�&nbsp; Chelsea asked.
�I don&#8217;t know what help I&#8217;ll be, but it&#8217;d be a nice change,� Skyler agreed as she listened to the kids shouting and laughing.&nbsp; �The only time Hunter and Tristan have ever laughed was when their dad wasn&#8217;t home and you know how rare that was,� Skyler said, smiling at the boys.&nbsp; �I just wanna apologize for how I��&nbsp; 
�You don&#8217;t need to apologize for anything, but I do wish you&#8217;d try and relax, at least a little bit.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;ll try my best, I&#8217;m sorry.�&nbsp; 

Less than one week later, Skyler and Logan were on their way to see Tyler.&nbsp; Frannie was watching Hunter and Tristan.&nbsp; They had all been getting to know her and the boys adored the woman since she gave them fresh baked cookies on a regular basis.

Tyler smiled when he saw Skyler and little Tyler.&nbsp; She sat across the table from him as he reached for the baby.&nbsp; 

Skyler had the majority of her lies ready for Tyler&#8217;s questions; she was just hoping she wouldn&#8217;t mess it up.

�I&#8217;m surprised you came,� Tyler admitted.
�I know you&#8217;re not going to be in here forever and I wanted to see what you thought I should do.�&nbsp; 
�That&#8217;s a good thing to do.&nbsp; Where&#8217;re you staying?�&nbsp; 
�They took us to a shelter.�&nbsp; 
�I want you to go stay with my folks.�&nbsp; 
�Tyler, I don&#8217;t wanna stay with your parents,� Skyler whispered, leaning towards Tyler.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t even know your parents and they&#8217;ve never come to see the boys.&nbsp; Besides that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to be at your trial if I went there, because who would watch the boys?&nbsp; And what if your dad really likes hugging me?&nbsp; Shouldn&#8217;t I just stay where I&#8217;m at for now?�&nbsp; 
�I guess you have some good points, maybe you should just go back to the house.�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t know, maybe.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d like being there alone though, I just thought I could stay at the shelter for now and figure it out from there.�&nbsp; 
�Are you sure they&#8217;re gonna find me guilty?�&nbsp; 
�They said they found a tag with your name on it in his hand,� Skyler stated.&nbsp; �Plus you tried running away and making me desert two of our sons� I don&#8217;t see why you can&#8217;t just let me go?�&nbsp; 
�Because you&#8217;re mine, you&#8217;ve always been mine and you&#8217;ll be mine until the day you die so get use to it already.�&nbsp; 
�You know how I feel about you.&nbsp; Why d&#8217;you need to hold on so tight?�&nbsp; 
�Because I can so just stop fucking with me and accept it!&nbsp; I don&#8217;t wanna hear anything about you with anyone while I&#8217;m in here either or that&#8217;ll be on your head too,� he whispered angrily.
�Okay, I&#8217;m sorry,� Skyler conceded, quietly looking down.

Skyler remained silent for the rest of the visit, while Tyler played and talked with his son.&nbsp; As the visit ended, he gave Skyler a look that let her know she had better give him the kiss and hug he expected, before she left so that was what she did.&nbsp; All she could do on the way out of the building was cry.&nbsp; 

Chelsea put Logan into his car seat and helped Skyler into the car from where she had leaned against it while she cried.

�It didn&#8217;t go so well I&#8217;m guessing.�&nbsp; 
�He&#8217;s never gonna let me go, I feel so helpless and he&#8217;s not even here.�&nbsp; 
�We can do what you need, change your identity or get a restraining order, whatever you need.�&nbsp; 
�You don&#8217;t understand; he&#8217;s never controlled me by threatening me.&nbsp; I would&#8217;ve just let him kill me if it had ever just been me.&nbsp; He knows it&#8217;s the people I love that keep me where he wants me.&nbsp; David, Frisbee, Nikki, Josh and Jenny were just warnings.&nbsp; I know the two days he was gone he killed my father.&nbsp; He&#8217;ll hurt my sister and my mother, Hunter, Tristan, the new baby, you and Frannie, he doesn&#8217;t care.&nbsp; Look how long it took to find David.&nbsp; He won&#8217;t let me go and I don&#8217;t understand it, but I know when he gets out, I&#8217;ll have to go to him,� Skyler hung her head, still feeling trapped.
�We&#8217;ll figure something out.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t spend all your time worrying, you should be thinking about the baby now.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m sure he probably has the best lawyer his parents could afford and in a little while, I won&#8217;t need to worry about my baby.&nbsp; I need you to do me one more favor, please?�&nbsp; 
�Sky, he&#8217;s not getting out for a long time.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve seen the charges against him and he&#8217;d have to be Houdini to wiggle his way outta this one,� Chelsea assured her.
�I know I have no right to ask you, but please?�&nbsp; 
��&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; What would you need me to do?�&nbsp; 
�Make sure my mother gets Hunter, Tristan and the new baby?&nbsp; I know Tyler won&#8217;t let me keep any of them and I really don&#8217;t want them going into foster care, they&#8217;ve been through so much already,� Skyler explained, rubbing her hands together.
�What about Logan?�&nbsp; 
�Tyler will never let him go either.�&nbsp; 
�Helluva confusing life for a little boy.�&nbsp; 
�Am I a horrible mother?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know what else to do.�&nbsp; 
�No you&#8217;re not a horrible mother.&nbsp; You know that Tyler won&#8217;t hurt Logan?&nbsp; I mean for a fact?�&nbsp; 
�He knows that if he ever hurts one of the boys that he&#8217;d have to kill me and I know for a fact that he can&#8217;t let me go, besides, he claims his namesake, it&#8217;s just the other boys he doesn&#8217;t want,� Skyler explained.&nbsp; �So would you do that for me?�&nbsp; 
�I can do that.�&nbsp; 
�He&#8217;s already gonna be angry when he finds out I lied about staying at a shelter.�&nbsp; 
�Well, I guess we&#8217;ll just have to fix that too.�&nbsp; 

Skyler never said a word to Chelsea; all she could manage to do was stare out the window.&nbsp; 

Chelsea made several phone calls from the house, letting Skyler know, that should Tyler try getting in touch with her, the shelter would call the house immediately.&nbsp; Skyler was so excited and grateful that she grabbed Chelsea to hug her, pulling away quickly before apologizing about getting so excited.&nbsp; Chelsea laughed, telling Skyler it wasn&#8217;t a problem.

The trial only took a little over a week to begin and it lasted about the same length of time.&nbsp; Skyler didn&#8217;t dare to not show up during Tyler&#8217;s trial, making sure to give him a kiss every day before and after court.&nbsp; 

Skyler noticed Tyler&#8217;s parents in the courtroom, but they never tried to speak with her, as though their son&#8217;s insanity was all her fault.&nbsp; She especially thought it was odd the way Tyler never even looked at his parents while they were there, the only one he ever glanced at was Skyler and it scared her to death.&nbsp; If she hadn&#8217;t been so afraid of what he was capable of when he got out, she never would have sat through any of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

During that time, Skyler and Chelsea had begun getting closer as well.&nbsp; Skyler loved hearing the stories of Chelsea growing up or looking through photo albums with her and Frannie.&nbsp; 

Frannie and Chelsea had moved to the cities from New York less than two months after her father had been killed.&nbsp; They needed a new start, away from the people her father had been involved with before his death.&nbsp; 

Not only Skyler had grown close to Frannie, but the boys had even begun calling her nana around that time.&nbsp; Frannie loved it and she seemed to love them as much as they were all beginning to love her.&nbsp; 

In between going to Tyler&#8217;s trial, Skyler had begun going to the clinic for checkups for the first time through any of her pregnancies and Chelsea was always at her side.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Chelsea wasn&#8217;t at all pleased when the doctor informed Skyler that she was undernourished.&nbsp; Frannie seemed to be cooking or baking almost continuously once she heard that.&nbsp; Skyler wound up full so much of the time that she needed to wear sweat suits more often than not.&nbsp; 

One night, hoping they could all relax and trying to give the boys some other kids to play with, Chelsea invited Matt, Val and their three girls over for dinner.&nbsp; 

When Skyler first laid eyes on Val, she couldn&#8217;t believe how similar in looks she was to Nikki Freeman with the long dark hair, piercing brown eyes, perfectly chiseled facial features, like a model on a magazine cover.&nbsp; Skyler&#8217;s insides tightened up as she decided to only look at Val if she absolutely had to. 

Skyler was very quiet through most of the evening, only feeling comfortable as she watched the kids playing together.&nbsp; It took a little time for the boys to play with the girls, but they were so polite any time one of the girls wanted a toy they had, handing it over to them immediately until Val would scold whichever of the girls was making the demands, letting them know they needed to share.&nbsp; Skyler would always have a small smile when Val would scold whichever girl had been making the demand.&nbsp; 

Matt and Val could both see it was going to take Skyler a little time to join in on the conversation, but they still enjoyed what little she did contribute.

The final day of the trial was priceless as Skyler sat listening to Tyler tell one lie after another during his testimony, but there wasn&#8217;t a single thing she could do about any of it.&nbsp; Chelsea managed to slip into the back row of the courtroom unnoticed as Tyler began to speak.&nbsp; 

Through most of what Tyler had said, Skyler didn&#8217;t dare look at him, for fear of standing up and calling him a liar, so she sat quietly, listening to Tyler talk about how everyone in the school had known he and Skyler had feelings for one another since the ninth grade, but the night of the party David had gone around telling people that he was going to nail Skyler, so Tyler had confronted him.&nbsp; 

He explained how drunk David had been and that they had gotten into a small scuffle before giving David one last shove, but it never occurred to Tyler that he was actually hurt when he rolled down the hill since he was calling him names as Tyler walked away to take Skyler from the&nbsp; party.&nbsp; 

Tyler began to cry as he spoke about the fact that he wanted to check on David, but then he found out Skyler was pregnant and things just began to snowball out of control.&nbsp; He apologized, saying he knew it was wrong to not get in touch with anyone, but after the pregnancy discussion was over, he was too afraid to come forward and now he had three sons to worry about, making him even more afraid.&nbsp; 

When asked why he was willing to leave two of his three sons behind if he was so worried about them, Tyler claimed his feelings were that they were old enough to understand what was going on and he didn&#8217;t think a life on the run would be good since they would both be going to school so soon.&nbsp; He began crying when he relayed how much he missed his boys and how much he loved them.&nbsp; 

The only thing Skyler could manage to do was look down and cry, while Chelsea slipped in and out of the courtroom.

Waiting until sentencing was handed down, was making Skyler a nervous wreck.&nbsp; She wished Chelsea could&#8217;ve been with her, but she knew it would drive Tyler crazy, seeing them in the same room together, so Chelsea paced by the car as she waited.&nbsp; 

It only took the jury a little over two hours to return with their verdict, which was for a lesser charge and not even related to David&#8217;s death.&nbsp; His sentence would be three to five years, less if he was released for good behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Skyler began crying, but not for the reason everyone thought.&nbsp; Her main reason for tears was the disappointment she felt when they hadn&#8217;t given him the death penalty.&nbsp; Yet again, he had pulled the veil over everyone&#8217;s eyes.&nbsp; If they could have gotten away with dropping the charges against him completely, they would have.&nbsp; 

Tyler was positive by Skyler&#8217;s reaction that she had finally fallen completely in love with him and tried consoling her by explaining to her that he would be out much sooner, which only made her cry harder.&nbsp; His cuffed hands grasped her stomach as she cried into his chest.

�You pregnant Skyler?�&nbsp; 
�Yes,� she replied, nodding her head reluctantly. 

Without missing a beat, Tyler began speaking extremely loud to his lawyer about getting him out earlier since his wife was pregnant with their fourth child.&nbsp; 

Skyler glared at Tyler with hatred so deep, she could have killed him with just a look, but she pushed the negative thoughts out of her mind, forcing herself to quickly look down at the floor.&nbsp; A few weeks earlier he had wanted her to leave two of their children to whatever might happen to them and she had no doubt that if things hadn&#8217;t changed, she would have never had the chance to even hold the little girl she was carrying.&nbsp; 

Before the guards led him away, Tyler gave Skyler one last hug and kiss, leaving her to feel completely numb.&nbsp; Tyler&#8217;s lawyer made an attempt to console Skyler, assuring her he would have Tyler free in no time, making her cry even harder.

Skyler couldn&#8217;t speak anymore by the time she reached Chelsea; every time she tried to explain what had happened, she would cry, leaving her unable to speak.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t seem to make her mind work well enough to gather any solid thoughts.&nbsp; Skyler was filled with so many emotions, yet unable to sort through any of them.&nbsp; It was only after the boys had been put to bed that she was able to regain her ability to form words.

�Remember what you said about Houdini?�&nbsp; 
�You&#8217;re shittin&#8217; me?�&nbsp; 
�No and why wasn&#8217;t his testimony even investigated?&nbsp; It was one lie after another.� 
�All lies?�&nbsp; 
�Yes!&nbsp; All of it!&nbsp; I mean to begin with, he may have had a thing for me in high school, but the feelings were &#8216;not&#8217; mutual and David didn&#8217;t even drink; beyond that I didn&#8217;t know for sure until maybe three months later when &#8216;he&#8217; told &#8216;me&#8217; I was pregnant.�&nbsp; 
�He told you?�&nbsp; 
�Yeah, but I feel sick even telling you this.�&nbsp; 
�I wouldn&#8217;t force you to tell me, I just thought that if you wanted to, I&#8217;m here.�&nbsp; 
�Not being full of myself or anything, since he&#8217;s so sick and all, but I&#8217;m like a drug to Tyler and he&#8217;s needed a fix at least three times a day, if not more, since the very first day.&nbsp; He knew I hadn&#8217;t gotten my period and he loved telling me that I wasn&#8217;t going to be finishing school.�&nbsp; 
�D&#8217;you have any idea why he would&#8217;ve killed the other people you told me about?�&nbsp; 
�Josh and Nikki were because of a stupid little game we played after necking at a party when we told each other who we thought was hot and I think Jenny was because I told Tyler that I had talked to her about my relationship with him, I just don&#8217;t know when or how since we were living in the Cities already by the time he showed me the news bulletin of her missing.�&nbsp; 
�I wonder if we could find any sorta evidence if we did new autopsies,� Chelsea pondered out loud.
�I doubt it, Tyler&#8217;s a lot of things, but he&#8217;s definitely not stupid.�&nbsp; 

Chelsea admitted to sneaking into the courtroom for Tyler&#8217;s testimony.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t understand how he could fool so many people along his way, admitting he may be charming, but to side-step a murder charge and wind up with a maximum of five years, which she herself knew he would never serve, was a concept she just couldn&#8217;t grasp.&nbsp; 

As Skyler began to cry, Chelsea held her, almost shedding tears of her own.&nbsp; When Skyler was able to calm down, Chelsea promised they would figure it all out together. 
&nbsp; 
The moment Skyler lifted her head to look into Chelsea&#8217;s eyes, she knew what she was feeling as the warmth tingled through her body; Chelsea knew she had felt it all along.&nbsp; Softly and slowly their lips met in a kiss like none Skyler had ever felt before.&nbsp; As their lips pressed lightly together, the warmth in their groins was overwhelming.&nbsp; When tongues began to mingle, the electricity traveled through their insides, not stopping until it reached down to their pubic bones.&nbsp; As the kiss deepened, they felt one another&#8217;s nipples hardening as they became locked in the embrace.&nbsp; 

Skyler wanted to let herself be swept away with the feelings she had for Chelsea, but she didn&#8217;t want to pull her in any deeper than she already was, quickly pulling away from Chelsea as Tyler&#8217;s threat echoed through her mind.&nbsp; 

�I can&#8217;t do this, this is wrong, I just can&#8217;t,� Skyler said, moving off the sofa.
�Why is it wrong?&nbsp; I know you care about me and I think I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.�&nbsp; 
�It&#8217;s wrong because we&#8217;ll never be able to be together, not completely.&nbsp; Tyler will always be there in some way and when he gets out��&nbsp; 
�When he gets out, what?&nbsp; You&#8217;ll just send off most of your children and do what he wants again?&nbsp; Don&#8217;t you think you deserve better than that?�&nbsp; 
�You&#8217;ve seen what he can get away with.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t take that chance; I won&#8217;t take that chance, not with the lives of anyone.&nbsp; He warned me the day I went to see him; he said it would be on my head if I got involved with anyone while he was locked up.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t tell you everything about the day he brought me down here, when I told him if he hurt my baby he might as well just kill me.&nbsp; He told me that it was always up to me if the boys got hurt.&nbsp; If I don&#8217;t do what he wants, he&#8217;ll just make it so I can&#8217;t hurt myself.&nbsp; I think the kids and I should leave tomorrow and go to Tyler&#8217;s parent&#8217;s house just like he wanted me to do in the beginning, you should forget you ever knew me.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry but that&#8217;s just how it needs to be.�&nbsp; Skyler said, walking away.

Skyler crawled into bed, crying herself to sleep as Chelsea stood outside with her head against the door listening to the muffled sobs.

Chapter 10

The following morning, Chelsea had the boys up and dressed early, taking them to Frannie&#8217;s house after arranging for her to keep them through the morning.&nbsp; All three boys ran eagerly to the elderly woman looking for cookies, making both women smile.

Back home, Chelsea began pacing until Skyler walked into the living room looking for the boys.

�I took &#8216;em to mom&#8217;s this morning.�&nbsp; 
�Great, they&#8217;re gonna be on a sugar high all day,� Skyler laughed.&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t mind and I know you love it,� Chelsea commented, moving closer to the sofa.
�What&#8217;re you doing Chelsea?�&nbsp; 
�Trying to talk you out of giving me up.�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t have you &#8216;to&#8217; give up.�&nbsp; 
�But you do Sky, you have me heart and soul.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t know how happy I could be until you came to stay with me.&nbsp; I love you, I love the boys and I especially love you all here,� Chelsea admitted, afraid to look Skyler in the eyes.
�You know, after the second time I met you, you were always with me.&nbsp; Whenever Tyler touched me in a nice way, it wasn&#8217;t him touching me, it was you.&nbsp; It would always turn into him again since he&#8217;s nuts and all, but for a while, it was always nice.&nbsp; I just can&#8217;t do this, don&#8217;t you understand?&nbsp; The boys, Frannie, you, my mom and sister, even Matt, Val and the girls won&#8217;t be safe if anything happens between us, you have to let me go, let us go,� Skyler stated, looking directly at Chelsea.
�Does it matter at all to you that I want you to stay, or that I&#8217;m a cop and could have other cops here in a matter of minutes if Tyler gets out of hand, or that I could afford as many bodyguards as we need to protect us.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know about you, but I wouldn&#8217;t wanna quit before I at least tried the real thing,� Chelsea claimed, stepping a little closer to Skyler.
�Can you promise me that everyone we love will be safe?�&nbsp; Skyler asked, staring deeply into Chelsea&#8217;s eyes.&nbsp; �I mean, really promise me?�&nbsp; 
�I promise that you and everyone will have bodyguards as soon as I know he&#8217;s loose.�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t care about me, none of this has ever been about, well I guess that&#8217;s not really true, but I don&#8217;t care if he gets hold of me, he won&#8217;t kill me, but he won&#8217;t hesitate to kill anyone else.&nbsp; If you can&#8217;t honestly promise me that everyone, including you will stay safe, then the boys and I have to leave.�
�I promise I will keep everyone you love, safe, you have my word on it.�&nbsp; 
�You know, someday you&#8217;re gonna wish you had never fallen in love with me.�&nbsp; 
�Never gonna happen,� Chelsea assured her.
�Never isn&#8217;t as easy to do as it is to say,� Skyler pointed out.&nbsp; �And I am gonna break our hearts as soon as he&#8217;s out of prison.�&nbsp; 
�We&#8217;ll worry about that when it happens.�&nbsp; 
�Well...�&nbsp; Skyler began playing with her robe tie at first, slowly looking Chelsea in the eyes.&nbsp; �If you&#8217;re sure, d&#8217;you think we could try that kiss again?�

Chelsea smiled, smoothly closing the gap between Skyler and herself.&nbsp; The kiss was just as gentle and loving, yet equally as electric as it had been the night before.&nbsp; 

Skyler felt emotions and urges waking up in her that she never knew existed as Chelsea backed into the bedroom, kissing Skyler as she continued pulling her along.&nbsp; The moment they entered the bedroom, Skyler began unbuttoning Chelsea&#8217;s blouse as Skyler&#8217;s robe was removed and Chelsea relieved Skyler of her pajama top while her own bra was being unhooked.
&nbsp; 
Wherever they touched each other, skin on skin, heat on heat, everything was getting so intense as Skyler&#8217;s skin felt alive.&nbsp; Chelsea experienced equal amounts of pleasure, the electricity almost overwhelming as they connected physically as well as emotionally.&nbsp; Skyler was nervous, but she had consciously made the decision, not to hold anything back for the first time in her life.&nbsp; 

The two women continued kissing as bottoms and panties were removed before Chelsea gently pulled Skyler onto the bed with her.&nbsp; 

Skyler&#8217;s heart was beating so hard she could feel the vibrations in her head as Chelsea began kissing her neck, tenderly kissing Skyler&#8217;s rock hard nipples before gently massaging them with her mouth and the palm of her hand, continuing on that way as Skyler groaned from sheer desire.&nbsp; 

Chelsea stopped on her way down, kissing Skyler&#8217;s stomach before laying her ear against it.&nbsp; 

�Are you okay?�&nbsp; Skyler asked, slightly out of breath.
�I&#8217;m fine, I just wanted to see if our little girl was gonna talk to me.�&nbsp; 
�And is she?�&nbsp; Skyler asked, running her hand through Chelsea&#8217;s hair.
�Not yet, but she&#8217;s gonna be a talker and I adore her already,� Chelsea noted, smiling up at Skyler. 
�She adores you too, I can feel it,� Skyler replied, with a smile that suddenly felt permanent.

Chelsea kissed her stomach before continuing on her journey to Skyler&#8217;s thighs where she lovingly kissed the insides while her fingers tenderly fondled the hard and eager nipples.&nbsp; 

She moved her mouth up, running her tongue gently through Skyler&#8217;s vulva, encouraging her hips to thrust her scintillating sex forward.&nbsp; Chelsea loved her scent, inhaling deeply of Skyler&#8217;s need and desire, slowly letting out her breath, only to take another as she closed her eyes, savoring the fragrance.&nbsp; Chelsea dipped her tongue into that heavenly opening, devouring Skyler, unable to get enough of her as she dove into her slit.&nbsp; Chelsea imbibed of the most wonderful nectar she had ever tasted as it danced over her tongue while gradually moving to Skyler&#8217;s hard little nubbin.&nbsp; 

The air was alive with whimpers and moans as Chelsea slipped three fingers inside, winding and touching as Skyler thrust into her fingers.&nbsp; Chelsea continued gliding through Skyler&#8217;s slit, circling her swollen clitty, forcing a groan from her lips as she began french kissing her clit, causing Skyler to shudder immediately before her orgasm hit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

�Oh yessssss!!!!�&nbsp; Skyler hissed as she clutched at the bedding.

Chelsea continued on until there were nothing but tiny aftershocks causing Skyler to shake and quake occasionally.&nbsp; Chelsea made her way back up Skyler&#8217;s body, giving her small kisses along the way, including a light one on the lips when she arrived.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Skyler couldn&#8217;t remember ever having an orgasm feel as intense as the one she&#8217;d just had.&nbsp; It was so different than any she had ever experienced with Tyler.&nbsp; This was filled with caring, not obsession, it was of giving and sharing of emotion, of self� of love.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Chelsea held Skyler close, stroking her hair until she could get herself together enough to move again.&nbsp; 

�You&#8217;re so beautiful,� Skyler observed.
�You&#8217;re the beautiful one,� Chelsea returned.
�I&#8217;ve never done this before.�
�That&#8217;s okay sweetie, I have,� Chelsea said, reassuringly.

Skyler leaned in for another one of those fabulously, soft kisses, perfect with the way their tongues danced together, not anything like Tyler trying to get down her throat and she knew she was going to grow to love them even more than she already did.

Skyler continued her journey of discovery, coming to the spot where Chelsea had been shot.&nbsp; Between her left breast and shoulder was a three or four inch scar that Skyler focused on for a few seconds, kissing it as Chelsea stroked her hair.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

On the move again, Skyler made her way to Chelsea&#8217;s nipples, tenderly fondling, kissing and suckling until nothing but moaning was coming out of her mouth.&nbsp; The feel of Skyler&#8217;s lips on her excited nipples was divine. 

Chelsea&#8217;s hands, gently guided Skyler from breast to breast where she delightfully enjoyed the smoothness of Chelsea&#8217;s skin against her lips until she was being persuaded to move on.

Skyler may not have been very experienced at pleasing another woman, but she was positive that what she was doing was making some of the sweetest sounds come out of Chelsea&#8217;s mouth.&nbsp; As she continued leaving a trail of soft, affectionate kisses down Chelsea&#8217;s stomach and ribs, the strawberry-blonde began writhing continuously.&nbsp; Running her tongue around Chelsea&#8217;s naval brought about a tiny giggle, making Skyler smile broadly before moving down again.

Chelsea continued leading Skyler to her ultimate goal until Skyler rubbed the officer&#8217;s hand lightly with her own on it&#8217;s way back to Chelsea&#8217;s beautiful breast where it began fondling while she lay her cheek against that gorgeous strawberry-blonde bush.&nbsp; The wonderfully, puffy lips in front of Skyler, were slowly being covered with light and gentle kisses.&nbsp; She could smell Chelsea&#8217;s excitement and it intoxicated her as she examined her sex up close.&nbsp; The site before her was the most glorious thing she had ever seen, a little slit, puffy and red, begging to be tasted.

Skyler was nervous, but not nervous enough to go against her desire to taste and feel what she considered to be the most beautiful site ever.&nbsp; After several uncertain licks, she realized that Chelsea tasted a little sweeter than her own juices had and all hesitation was gone.&nbsp; Skyler had a sudden realization that she would never be able to get enough of the sweet pussy in her view. 

Once Chelsea let out an involuntary shiver, Skyler became a woman possessed, as she dipped her tongue in and out of her lover&#8217;s hole, up through that lovely crevice and back down to do it all over again,&nbsp; Skyler continued enjoying the flavor with her mouth while one hand continued moving from one hard, mountainous nipple to the other.&nbsp; It occurred to the blonde, that she could enjoy doing what she was for a very long time, at least until she began inserting her fingers into Chelsea&#8217;s hole, one at a time and the woman beneath her began wiggling and whimpering from the attention.

As Chelsea began begging to be taken, Skyler couldn&#8217;t help but travel through at least a few more times before her warm, wet tongue began flicking at Chelsea&#8217;s clit while her fingers were pumping away at the Strawberry-blonde pussy.&nbsp; The moment Chelsea was ready to explode with pleasure, Skyler engulfed her swollen clit with her mouth, sucking in as she pushed the flat of her tongue against it.&nbsp; Chelsea experienced a most intense orgasm, lasting at least several minutes as Skyler continued her movements until all Chelsea had left were small aftershocks.&nbsp; 

Before taking a break, Skyler&#8217;s tongue began lapping up the juices that had spilled out of the wonderful officer.&nbsp; The entire experience had been one of the most amazing Skyler had ever been a part of and she loved every moment of it, smiling as she made her way back up to lie beside Chelsea.&nbsp; 

Skyler had made a choice, for the first time in a long time she chose to love someone and all she could go on that it wouldn&#8217;t be a disaster, was hope.

In Chelsea&#8217;s arms, Skyler felt loved and safe for the first time since she was a child.&nbsp; Chelsea, herself had never felt so completely loved or in love.&nbsp; Skyler fit into her arms, her life and her heart so perfectly.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t imagine ever having to be without her again.&nbsp; This was the love she had waited so many years for and she was happy beyond any happiness she had ever known.&nbsp; Whatever was needed to keep Skyler safe is what Chelsea would do.&nbsp; 

As the weeks passed, Skyler moved into Chelsea&#8217;s bedroom while Skyler&#8217;s bedroom had been turned into a nursery.&nbsp; The boys were thriving, becoming so content that it made Skyler just that much happier and when Skyler was happy, so was Chelsea.&nbsp; 

They had also been having dinners at Matt and Val&#8217;s home quite regularly, to the point of where Skyler was feeling more comfortable around them.&nbsp; Not comfortable enough to open up about her volatile relationship with Tyler, but at least she was able to talk openly about the children and Chelsea.&nbsp; 

Val was beginning to see how special Skyler truly was and she understood why Chelsea couldn&#8217;t help but fall in love with her.&nbsp; 

Frannie was very pleased with her daughter&#8217;s choice, since Skyler was just an all around sweet and loving person, making it so easy to love her as much as she loved her own daughter.&nbsp; 

Once Skyler&#8217;s head cleared and something at least resembling a sense of safety returned, she found the courage to call her own mother.&nbsp; When she heard Asia&#8217;s voice on the phone, Skyler began to tremble, but she fought her fears and dug deep for her courage.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

�Mom?�&nbsp; 
�Skyler?�&nbsp; 
�Yeah, it&#8217;s me mom,� she answered shakily, swiping at her tears.&nbsp; �How&#8217;ve you been?�&nbsp; 
�Fine time for you to call.&nbsp; Why didn&#8217;t you call when your father died?�&nbsp; 
�He, Tyler wouldn&#8217;t let me.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve barely been out of the house in year&#8217;s mom.�&nbsp; 
�Some men came by not too long ago and wanted permission to do an autopsy on your father.&nbsp; They said they were suspicious about how he died, but your dad wanted to be cremated.&nbsp; Do they think Tyler had something to do with his death?�&nbsp; 
�I, I think so.�&nbsp; 

The silence before Asia spoke again was deafening.&nbsp; Skyler had no idea what her mother was going to say, but she hardly expected the next words that came across the phone lines. 

�� Skyler, I know you&#8217;re my daughter, but you stay away from me and Heather, I don&#8217;t want you bringing that badness back here,� Asia stated, her voice quivering.
�I, I&#8217;m sorry; I don&#8217;t know what I was thinking.&nbsp; I love you mom and Heather, goodbye,� Skyler hung up the phone, breaking down as Chelsea walked into the house.

Chelsea went to her immediately, listening as Skyler repeated the conversation between her and Asia.&nbsp; Holding Skyler close, Chelsea cried with her, not very surprised any longer how Skyler found herself in an abusive situation.&nbsp; She wished she could take away the hurt, but the best she could do was to make Skyler and the boys as happy as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Chelsea did whatever she could to make Skyler feel better about her life.&nbsp; She would bring a new toy home for the boys at least every other week and when they would go out to eat, it would always be at a place where the boys could run and play.&nbsp; Chelsea loved the look Skyler would get on her face when the boys were happy and playing hard.&nbsp; 

Then there would be those days when Skyler would get letters from Tyler, always a hidden threat in them because she hadn&#8217;t been back to see him since the trial.&nbsp; He always mentioned wanting to go visit her mother and sister or he hoped Hunter and Tristan were doing well.&nbsp; 

Skyler knew exactly what he meant so she would always hand them over to Chelsea, barely needing to explain them any further by that point.&nbsp; That was when the depression would set in again because she knew she would have to leave when he was released.&nbsp; Skyler tried keeping Tyler calm by telling him she didn&#8217;t really have anyone to watch the kids so she could visit, but that only worked for so long.

When Tyler began writing every day, Chelsea had been pushed too far.&nbsp; She made an appointment for Skyler to see Tyler&#8217;s therapist so he would know the entire story, from beginning to end and she wanted her leaving nothing out.&nbsp; Chelsea felt the therapist should know the extent of Tyler&#8217;s illness, becoming aware of every little detail and maybe Skyler could be helped in the process.&nbsp; Skyler had her doubts that anyone would be swayed by her story of their lives together, but Chelsea wanted it so badly, she didn&#8217;t feel it would actually hurt anything by that point.

The therapist was thankful to have another side to the story as well, claiming he would be recommending some limits when Tyler was eventually released.&nbsp; Skyler stressed the fact that he shouldn&#8217;t tell Tyler she had discussed anything with him, only speaking after she felt she could trust him.&nbsp; After her meeting, she did feel better for a while.&nbsp; Skyler was so happy for the first time in her life and she really didn&#8217;t want to lose that.

One day, Skyler was surprised when Val brought the girls over to play with the boys while Matt and Chelsea were working.&nbsp; The two women sat down with coffee and some of Frannie&#8217;s brownies while they watched the kids playing.&nbsp; The living room was big enough for them to talk without the kids hearing what they were saying.&nbsp; 

Chelsea thought it might be a good idea if Skyler had more than just her to confide in and Val was more than willing, even after being warned that some of the information may be very disturbing.

�Just what I need is a brownie,� Val laughed.&nbsp; Matt&#8217;s gonna start calling me fatty.�&nbsp; 
�I can&#8217;t see Matt saying too much to you.�&nbsp; 
�True, he does know his place.�&nbsp; 
�Is it fun being in charge of a relationship?�&nbsp; 
�You must have some say with Chelsea.�&nbsp; 
�She claims I do, but I wouldn&#8217;t know how to go about making a decision about anything.&nbsp; She gives me options and I usually just pick the one that I think would make her or the boys the happiest,� Skyler laughed.
�Why don&#8217;t you pick the one that would make you happy?�&nbsp; 
�I went from my parent&#8217;s house, to Tyler&#8217;s house to Chelsea&#8217;s house, I have no clue what would make me happy.�
�Are you satisfied with that?�&nbsp; 
�Right now I&#8217;m mostly just happy with feeling safe and loved for the first time since I was 16.�&nbsp; 
�You know if you ever wanna talk Sky, I&#8217;m here.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t wanna overstep our friendship, but I know that if you&#8217;re anything like me there&#8217;re probably some things that you might not feel comfortable talking to Chelsea about, I mean Matt still doesn&#8217;t know that I was raped by a family relative when I was 11,� Val stated, looking genuinely shocked at herself.&nbsp; �Actually Chelsea doesn&#8217;t even know that and I have no idea why I just blurted that out.�&nbsp; 
�I won&#8217;t tell her, I promise.�&nbsp; 
�Thank you, but I really wasn&#8217;t trying to put you in the position to keep more secrets from her, and I know that if you did tell her, she&#8217;d never tell Matt, she wouldn&#8217;t wanna hurt him that way,� Val said out loud, more to comfort herself.
�She wouldn&#8217;t, she&#8217;s a good person.�&nbsp; 

The women sat in silence for a short time while they watched Hunter being the perfect gentleman as he helped Stephanie, Val&#8217;s oldest daughter, get onto the scooter.&nbsp; Both women looked at one another with a smile on their faces.

�I don&#8217;t really know how much Matt or Chelsea told you about me and Tyler,� Skyler stated, looking down.
�Not really much about Tyler, mostly that you had an amazing relationship with the boys is all I&#8217;ve heard.�&nbsp; 
�I guess there really isn&#8217;t much to tell.&nbsp; Tyler claims he loves me, but he pretty much stopped being even semi-nice to me after Logan was born.&nbsp; One of his favorite things to make me do was to be in charge of his orgasm during sex while I leaned into his hand with my throat.&nbsp; It use to turn him on even more when I&#8217;d pass out, and then he&#8217;d just finish on his own.&nbsp; It&#8217;s too sick to tell Chelsea.&nbsp; The only time he admits Hunter and Tristan are even his is when he gets into trouble.�&nbsp; 
�Oh my god Sky!&nbsp; Why would you stay with him?�&nbsp; Val asked.&nbsp; �I know you must have a good reason, but why?�&nbsp; 
�After the first time he raped me, he let me know that I was his and told me that he would hurt my little sister and my parents if I told anyone what he did.&nbsp; I was thinking about telling them anyway, but that first night he snuck into my bedroom and took my cat out and killed him before leaving him lay on the porch.&nbsp; When my mother found him the next morning, I knew right then I was trapped, especially when she wouldn&#8217;t believe that I hadn&#8217;t let &#8216;im out.&nbsp; The first time Chelsea pulled me outside to talk to her, Tyler left for two days and a week later he let me read my father&#8217;s obituary in the paper, that was the last paper we ever got.&nbsp; That was the day he broke my arm after I told him to just kill me already.�&nbsp; 
�Did you really want him to kill you?�&nbsp; 
�Until I remembered that Hunter was in the room.&nbsp; When I flew across the kitchen, Hunter started to cry, kinda snapped me back to reality and I knew I needed to stay strong for him.&nbsp; Tyler would never let me go that easy anyway, he&#8217;s completely obsessed with me for some reason that I&#8217;ve never understood.�&nbsp; 
�Holy shit, and here I thought Matt was an ass when he scolded me for leaving the sprinklers on too long.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know if I could&#8217;ve lasted even that long if I had to live the way you did.�&nbsp; 
�My babies&#8217;ve always been my strength and the safety of my family kept me where I was.
�It&#8217;s hard to imagine living that way?�&nbsp; 
�I guess I did get slapped at least once a day for something, but Tyler had his nice moments too.&nbsp; There were times he could be so sweet, kinda like he was when we were pretending to date.�&nbsp; 
�Pretending to date?�&nbsp; 
�I guess I should tell you the entire story.� 

Skyler spent the next 45 minutes explaining her entire relationship with Tyler and by the time she had finished, Val was left with her mouth agape.

�What d&#8217;you s&#8217;pose is actually wrong with him?�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;ve never known why he&#8217;s been so obsessed with me, the only thing he&#8217;s ever said was that when I was in the eighth grade, he saw me with a group of kids and he knew I was his.&nbsp; He thought I was special because I never had any single group of friends, I pretty much got along with everyone.�
�Interesting.�
�Why?�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t know, but I&#8217;m betting he was counting on that to save his ass.&nbsp; This is just my thought, but I bet he saw you as an extremely strong and self-sufficient person and yet no close, personal friends, that, my friend, would make you a very special person.&nbsp; I would imagine Tyler saw that and he wanted to have all of that specialness to himself, plus, it&#8217;d be easier to control you if you had no close friends and just had your family to consider,� Val suggested.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m just guessing though.�&nbsp; 
�You know, the day we got married, I remember looking at his family and mine, wondering why it was that I was the only one who knew he was insane and after it was over, I watched my parents and my sister walk straight to their car, like the only reason they were there was to make sure I went through with it.&nbsp; They never even walked over to hug me or anything and after talking to my mother on the phone the other day, I realized that she still doesn&#8217;t like me and I keep wondering what I did that was so bad that I deserved to be brutalized for six years and still lose my family anyway.&nbsp; I even tried calling my sister when I knew mom would be at work, but she wouldn&#8217;t talk to me at all.&nbsp; I went with him so my family would be safe and they are, but I still lost them just the same.&nbsp; It was crazy after the wedding, because the only one that hugged me was Tyler&#8217;s dad while his mother was busy telling him that he was gonna regret marrying a slut like me.&nbsp; I thought he was going to hit her for a minute, but then he turned his attention to the hug and on the way to the car I thought he was gonna break my hand he was squeezing it so hard and he had the nerve to accuse me of coming on to his father.&nbsp; That was the first time he actually hit me in the face.&nbsp; I guess he figured since we were married, he could do what he wanted to me... I guess he was right,� Skyler laughed, glancing at a shocked Val.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m sorry, I guess I said more than you wanted to hear.�&nbsp; 
�Not at all, I was just thinking that you&#8217;re one hell of a strong woman... I think I love you too,� Val said with a smile before she and Skyler both began laughing.

The two women talked about many things that day, one of which was the possibility of Skyler getting her diploma and going on to college.&nbsp; Skyler made it perfectly clear that she didn&#8217;t see how any of that would be possible with so many children running around.&nbsp; Val was determined not to let up on her about it any time soon.

Chapter 11

It had been a little over a month since Skyler had heard anything from Tyler and she was definitely worried about the possibility of his therapist relaying the information she had given him.&nbsp; That was the main reason she made sure she was also in any of the pictures she sent of the boys, but the entire situation was making her extremely nervous.&nbsp; She was trying to control it around Chelsea and the kids, but it did slip every once in a while if there was a loud bang or some other noise and she would jump before looking around.&nbsp; 

Two months later Skyler received the letter she was dreading and she knew it was time to make some arrangements for her children.&nbsp; All of her letters were still automatically forwarded from the shelter.&nbsp; 

Skyler waited until the boys had gone to bed before she would even approach Chelsea.&nbsp; They were sitting on the sofa when Skyler pulled the letter out of her pocket, laying it on Chelsea&#8217;s lap.&nbsp; 

�He finally wrote?�&nbsp; 
�Yeah and he knows about us somehow.�&nbsp; 
�That&#8217;s okay, we&#8217;ll deal with it, you need to stop worrying so much baby.� 
�I&#8217;m not worried anymore, I know exactly what&#8217;s gonna happen when he gets out and that&#8217;s why we need to talk.�&nbsp; 
�Let me read this first.�&nbsp; 

Chelsea opened the letter, reading through it several times.&nbsp; It all looked perfectly innocent.&nbsp; In the letter, Tyler thanked her for talking to his therapist and then he let her know that he was working on getting out sooner because he was looking forward to meeting Chelsea.&nbsp; He stated how happy he was knowing Skyler had someone to help her out while he was gone and that when he was free, he really wanted to take her on a long vacation.

�I&#8217;m guessing he&#8217;s pissed off that you saw his therapist behind his back and now he wants to hurt me and you.&nbsp; Am I reading this right?�&nbsp; 
�Close, according to that letter, he&#8217;s given up on me, but I don&#8217;t know how truthful he&#8217;s being, he&#8217;s always liked me scared; if he is telling the truth, it means he wants me dead.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not sure about you, I think he might be thinking he can control you somehow, but I don&#8217;t think he wants to kill you right now.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;d kill the bastard first.�&nbsp; 
�I always thought I could, but I was always too afraid of losing my babies,� Skyler admitted.&nbsp; �Plus, I just don&#8217;t think I have it in me to hurt anyone, not even Tyler.�&nbsp; 
�So, are you planning on spending the rest of the time he&#8217;s gone worrying about it?�&nbsp; 
�No, I just need to figure something out for the kids.&nbsp; I know my mother doesn&#8217;t want &#8216;em now, but she wouldn&#8217;t really be able to keep them safe anyway.&nbsp; I wanna ask you, but I just don&#8217;t know what he has planned for you.&nbsp; Tyler feeds on fear I think, but mostly it&#8217;s just my fear he enjoys.�&nbsp; 
�So you don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll be safe with me?�&nbsp; 
�Truthfully, I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll be safe anywhere if he really wants to get to &#8216;em, but I do believe you would be their best chance at staying safe.� 
�At some point, he&#8217;s gonna stop fooling people, you have to know that.�&nbsp; 
�You told me that, like four years ago the first time.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know, maybe, but if it happens, I would love to be alive to see it, I mean, I finally feel good about myself and you&#8217;ve been the biggest part of that, I don&#8217;t wanna let that go, really I don&#8217;t.&nbsp; I just need to know that the kids&#8217;re gonna be okay, just in case he manages to get away with killing me.&nbsp; You understand that, don&#8217;t you?�&nbsp; 
�I understand that, I just think you&#8217;re giving him too much credit.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t have any self-esteem left after all of those years, but you need to stop and look at where you are today and what you&#8217;ve managed to survive.&nbsp; You lived through six years of abuse and continuous beatings and you&#8217;re still an extremely strong person, even if you&#8217;re too afraid to admit it right now,� Chelsea explained, moving closer.
�I don&#8217;t want Tyler&#8217;s parents to get the kids and I sure don&#8217;t want him to have any influence in their lives� d&#8217;you think that you and your mother would be interested, or Matt and Val?�&nbsp; 
�You know how much we love the kids, I know mom would feel honored that you thought of her and so would Matt and Val.&nbsp; You want me to check into it?�&nbsp; 
�Please?�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;ll do it first thing Monday morning.�&nbsp; 
�I do love you.&nbsp; You know that, right?�&nbsp; 
�Not any more than I love you,� Chelsea said leaning in for a kiss.

Skyler took Chelsea by the hand leading her into the bedroom where they began kissing, almost roughly, a kiss created not only from need, but also of the desire the new lovers felt for one another.&nbsp; The kissing gradually slowed as clothes were being removed, yet there was no less passion involved as Skyler managed to pull Chelsea onto the bed with her before they were kissing and caressing again.

Chelsea positioned herself in between Skyler&#8217;s legs where she began grinding their pussies together as their juices began to mingle while still kissing voraciously, occasionally moaning into each other&#8217;s parted lips.&nbsp; 

As Skyler continued running her hands over Chelsea&#8217;s beautiful, sweat covered body, she was slowly beginning to understand this new move as the women&#8217;s clits were occasionally getting acquainted.&nbsp; 

Chelsea continued grinding her pussy against Skyler&#8217;s as they continued kissing and touching, neither woman taking their eyes off one another while Skyler gradually began to make some hip movements of her own, bringing out an occasional moan from both of them as their clits continued on their hit and miss mission.&nbsp; 

The women were panting and sweating together as Skyler felt the first little shiver travel through Chelsea&#8217;s body, followed by her own as her lover thrust into her.&nbsp; So much emotion was being shared as the women were becoming one, completely connected in this position.&nbsp; 

When Skyler&#8217;s hands began sliding over Chelsea&#8217;s muscular buttocks, the strawberry-blonde sighed before kissing Skyler passionately, never breaking her stride.&nbsp; Skyler thrust her hips slightly as Chelsea met her in her own thrust and soon the women were panting and professing their love for one another as Skyler dug her fingers into Chelsea&#8217;s ass immediately before the lover&#8217;s stiffened, but only for a second, until Chelsea had enough control back to carry them both through an amazing orgasm, forcing them both to scream into one another&#8217;s shoulders.

Before long, sweaty body was lying on sweaty body as the women found the lips they had lost track of for a few fleeting moments and they were kissing passionately again.

�I love you so much,� Skyler whispered into Chelsea&#8217;s ear.
�I love you too baby, so very much.�
�I never thought I could feel closer to you than I did, but that was amazing.�
�I know, I feel it too.&nbsp; It&#8217;s never gonna end, you know that, don&#8217;t you.�
�That&#8217;d be okay with me,� Skyler agreed, trying to pull out one of her best smiles.
�Me too,� Chelsea confirmed before kissing Skyler passionately again.

Kissing Chelsea was one of Skyler&#8217;s favorite things to do, but she felt it necessary to remind Chelsea that they had three little boys who would be waking up in a few short hours, forcing them to find a comfortable sleeping position.

Skyler tried falling asleep in Chelsea&#8217;s arms, but it didn&#8217;t come easy and not before the tears found their way out of her eyes.&nbsp; In that moment she knew her life was only a dream and she also knew that eventually she would have to wake up.

Chelsea took care of everything where the kids were concerned, even the one not born.&nbsp; 

Skyler had decided there wasn&#8217;t any reason to even answer Tyler&#8217;s letter.&nbsp; She assumed he had made up his mind, so she decided to just enjoy her new life for as long as she could.&nbsp; She just wanted to be happy, so she was.&nbsp; 

She loved watching the boys be able to play outside and if they saw a toy inside, they didn&#8217;t have to look around first to see if they were going to get into trouble.&nbsp; 

Hunter, at first sight, didn&#8217;t seem to have any lingering effects from life with his father and Skyler was hoping that Tristan was too young to remember him.&nbsp; She was especially hopeful that Logan wouldn&#8217;t remember anything that his father had ever said to him.

Skyler&#8217;s life was going well through her pregnancy and in February with Chelsea by her side in the delivery room, she gave birth to Anna Marie.&nbsp; 

She loved her boys, but she was so happy to have a little girl too.&nbsp; She hoped Anna&#8217;s brothers would love her as much as she did.&nbsp; 

Chelsea was flattered that Skyler named the baby after her middle name.&nbsp; She could feel their bond getting even stronger than it already was.&nbsp; 

Val and Matt had stopped by to see the new addition right around the time Skyler was feeling out of sorts about the boys not being with her.&nbsp; They seemed to be doing fine with Frannie and Chelsea.&nbsp; 

As visiting hours were ending, Chelsea was getting ready to walk out with Val and Matt after kissing Skyler goodnight.

�Give the boys hugs from me, even though they don&#8217;t seem to need me anymore.�&nbsp; 
�They really are your strength, aren&#8217;t they?�&nbsp; Val asked as Skyler nodded.
�I was saving it for a surprise, but they&#8217;ve been asking about you since we left the house so I was going to bring them up in the morning,� Chelsea confessed, grinning.
�Really?�&nbsp; Skyler asked, tears in her eyes.
�Really.&nbsp; They stopped playing and have just been sitting on the sofa asking about you every 10 minutes.&nbsp; I had to promise them they could come see you just to get &#8216;em off the sofa,� Chelsea explained.
�Then they do still need me?�&nbsp; 
�Yes they sure do,� Chelsea announced.
�Gee, that&#8217;s probably not a good thing, is it?�&nbsp; Skyler suddenly realized.&nbsp; �They&#8217;re gonna go crazy when I have to leave &#8216;em, aren&#8217;t they?�&nbsp; 
�I guess we&#8217;ll worry about that if it happens,� Chelsea said, walking back to kiss Skyler one more time.
�I&#8217;m sorry Chelsea,� Skyler whispered.
�Stop it, no reason to be sorry.&nbsp; Get some rest now and we&#8217;ll be back in the morning.�&nbsp; 

As Chelsea was walking out of the hospital with Matt and Val, Val put her arm around Chelsea&#8217;s shoulders, giving her a little hug.

�She&#8217;s pretty special, isn&#8217;t she?�&nbsp; Val asked.
�Very,� Chelsea agreed.
�You know, I did talk to her the other day and she told me some pretty scary things about Tyler.&nbsp; I&#8217;m afraid for her if he does get out,� Val confirmed.
�You think she&#8217;s really telling the entire truth?&nbsp; I mean, I know the guy&#8217;s an ass, but d&#8217;you really think he&#8217;s that bad?&nbsp; You don&#8217;t think she&#8217;s going a little overboard with her descriptions?�&nbsp; Matt asked.
�Stop playing devil&#8217;s advocate.&nbsp; I think he knows exactly how to keep her where he wants her and he&#8217;ll use anyone she loves to do it,� Val insisted.&nbsp; �Maybe even people she doesn&#8217;t love; could be just someone who she talked to or smiled at.&nbsp; Did you know that on their wedding day his father gave her a hug and Tyler almost broke her hand before punching her in the mouth, giving her a black eye and raping her and oh yeah, calling her a slut even though he&#8217;s the only reason she lost her virginity.�&nbsp; 
�She told you all that?�&nbsp; Chelsea asked, feeling slightly hurt.
�Stop looking like a wounded puppy, some things you just don&#8217;t wanna tell the person you love for fear that they&#8217;re never gonna look at you the same again,� Val confided.
�What haven&#8217;t you told me?�&nbsp; Matt asked her.
�I wasn&#8217;t necessarily talking about us,� Val assured, rubbing his arm, but not looking at him.
�I guess I can understand that.&nbsp; She has to know how much I love her though, doesn&#8217;t she?�&nbsp; Chelsea asked.
�She thinks you&#8217;re pretty special, I just don&#8217;t think she really knows who she is yet,� Val informed her.
�I don&#8217;t know what that means.�&nbsp; 
�Well, she was 16 when Tyler first raped her and she was married at 17 and lived with him for six years and then you moved her into your house and before too long you were together.&nbsp; How would she know for sure who she is when she&#8217;s never been on her own?�&nbsp; 
�So you think I should let her go?�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m not gonna say that, that would be between you two; I&#8217;m just saying that� I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m saying, but you do make her extremely happy.&nbsp; What I suggested was that maybe she could finish getting her diploma and go to college or something.�&nbsp; 
�That&#8217;s a good idea; I think that&#8217;s a great idea.&nbsp; What&#8217;d she say?�&nbsp; 
�She said she has four children, all under school age and she doesn&#8217;t think it&#8217;s doable.�&nbsp; 
�We&#8217;ll need to talk.�&nbsp; 
�Good idea.&nbsp; Mind if I come back with you when you bring the boys up?�&nbsp; 
�Sure, we&#8217;ll swing by and pick you up.�&nbsp; 
�Sounds good, see you then,� Val said as she and Matt went to their car.

Chelsea mulled the entire discussion over with Frannie once the boys were all tucked into bed.&nbsp; They would be sleeping with Chelsea that night and were asleep within seconds just knowing they would get to see their mother when they woke up.&nbsp; Frannie was all for the school idea, actually coming up with the idea to let Skyler get her diploma over the internet if she was uncomfortable about leaving the boys for so long and Frannie could hang around if she had any homework.&nbsp; 

Chelsea felt more positive about the entire situation as she gave her mother a hug and a kiss before going to join the boys in bed.

Chelsea had just blown the horn to let Val know they were waiting when she ran out the door.&nbsp; 

Upon entering the car, Val handed each of the boys a cookie on a napkin and then proceeded to watch as each boy wrapped it up before putting them in their pockets.&nbsp; She thought they were saving them for later, until they walked up to their mother in the hospital, each boy laying their cookie on their mother&#8217;s lap before looking at Val.&nbsp; 

She smiled at them all as they waited for Chelsea to pull up the rails on the bed.&nbsp; Once she helped the boys onto their mother, Chelsea took Anna to join them.&nbsp; It was a matter of minutes before all the boys and Anna were sound asleep.

�That was the most amazing thing I think I&#8217;ve ever seen,� Val admitted.
�That&#8217;s how quiet time works,� Chelsea informed her.
�I wish I could train my girls like that.�&nbsp; 
�That would mean you&#8217;d have to live with a madman for six years,� Skyler reminded her.
�Guess I&#8217;m pretty happy with the brats I&#8217;ve raised.�&nbsp; 
�I thought you might be,� Skyler said quietly, moving Hunter&#8217;s hair out of his eyes.
�I don&#8217;t think that can totally explain it since Anna doesn&#8217;t even know her father,� Chelsea pointed out.
�And she never will.&nbsp; Our sweet girl will never know that man,� Skyler insisted, looking at Chelsea.&nbsp; �Right?�&nbsp; 
�Hopefully none of them will ever go back to him.�&nbsp; 
�Hopefully,� Skyler agreed, looking at Logan with his arm around his sister.
�I don&#8217;t understand; how do they all know this?�&nbsp; Val asked.&nbsp; �I mean, wasn&#8217;t Logan excluded from most of this?�&nbsp; 
�Mostly, but he loves his brothers and his brothers love him so they trained him and I think it&#8217;s bonding for them,� Skyler suggested.
�I guess, whatever it is, it&#8217;s damn cute,� Val said as Skyler smiled at her.

It was during this time that Chelsea, Frannie and Val sat down to talk with Skyler about her diploma and the possibility of taking some college credits.&nbsp; Skyler protested at first until they suggested that maybe she do it over the internet.&nbsp; She explained that she had never used a computer, but Chelsea insisted she could teach her.&nbsp; By the time the kids began waking up, Skyler was at a definite maybe.&nbsp; Val could only smile calling her stubborn.&nbsp; 

At the end of the visit, Skyler smiled and thanked the boys for sitting with her.&nbsp; They told her they loved her and their new sister before Frannie and Val took them back home while Chelsea spent the rest of the day with Skyler and Anna. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

One week after being home, Skyler walked out to get the mail, the same way she had been.&nbsp; Hunter, Tristan and Logan always went with her so they each could &#8216;help&#8217; her carry it back into the house.&nbsp; That day Skyler noticed the forward on one of the envelopes and her blood went cold.&nbsp; She wouldn&#8217;t let any of the boys touch that letter.&nbsp; 

Once they all got inside, she sent the boys to play as she laid the envelope on the table.&nbsp; Chelsea was at work and Skyler was afraid to open it alone, just in case she should be in shock again after reading it.&nbsp; 

She managed to find things to keep her busy and happily Frannie called her around two, asking her and the kids to come over for a visit.&nbsp; She only lived three doors down, so that would be easy enough.&nbsp; Skyler asked the boys and they all cheered to go see nana.&nbsp; 

After sitting the boys down to cookies and milk and getting Anna uncovered, she and Frannie sat down to coffee.&nbsp; Skyler proceeded to tell Frannie about the letter she had just gotten and how she was afraid to open it.&nbsp; Frannie never said a word as she put on her jacket and boots to walk over to the house and get the letter.&nbsp; Upon her return, she put it down in front of Skyler, giving her a smile.

�If it&#8217;s bad, I&#8217;ll call Chelsea right away.�&nbsp; 
�You&#8217;re trouble,� Skyler said, opening the letter to read it.&nbsp; �Oh my god,� Skyler whispered hoarsely.

Frannie tried to get Skyler to speak, but all she could do was pass the letter to Frannie.&nbsp; Frannie read the letter at least three times before speaking.

�What am I missing dear?�&nbsp; 
�Him saying he&#8217;s very happy about our daughter means he&#8217;s really upset and angry.&nbsp; Him talking about his sister dying of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, means that she didn&#8217;t.&nbsp; I think he&#8217;s saying that he killed his baby sister when he was six years old and he wants to kill Anna,� Skyler whispered so the boys wouldn&#8217;t hear.&nbsp; �The part where he&#8217;s remembering the last time Tyler and I went to see him and how much he misses us, means that he doesn&#8217;t wanna kill me anymore.&nbsp; When he gets out, he&#8217;s coming to get us, just us which is what he means when he says that I know how he feels about the rest of the kids.&nbsp; He&#8217;s never liked them.&nbsp; This is just never going to end, I know it.&nbsp; The part where he talks about wives visiting their husbands overnight means he wants me to spend the night with him and the part where he says he can&#8217;t wait to meet you and Chelsea, means that if I don&#8217;t go see him, he&#8217;s gonna hurt one or both of you as soon as he gets out.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t even know who&#8217;s feeding him his information about the both of you and Anna being born.&nbsp; I shouldn&#8217;t even be here anymore, I should just leave.�&nbsp; 
�You stop talking like that right now young lady!�&nbsp; Frannie said so loudly that the boys stopped eating and looked at Skyler.
�It&#8217;s okay boys, nana just got excited.�&nbsp; 
�We&#8217;ll figure this all out, you&#8217;ll see.�&nbsp; 
�Well, whatever I do, I have to set up that visit.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want either of you getting hurt.�&nbsp; 
�I think you need to discuss it with Chelsea before you decide anything.�&nbsp; 
�She won&#8217;t want me to go.&nbsp; I feel our first big fight coming on.&nbsp; She just doesn&#8217;t understand how sadistic Tyler is, but I know exactly what he&#8217;s capable of.�&nbsp; 
�This is a hard decision to make and you shouldn&#8217;t decide anything right away.�&nbsp; 
�It&#8217;s an easy decision, I love you both.&nbsp; You&#8217;re closer to me than my birth family.&nbsp; If anything happened to either of you because of me, I&#8217;d never be able to live with myself.&nbsp; I have to do what I feel is best.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not like he&#8217;ll do anything to me that he hasn&#8217;t already done.&nbsp; He raped and degraded me for six years, I can take it.&nbsp; I think I should take the boys back now.� 
�Can&#8217;t they stay for a while?&nbsp; You should stay too.�&nbsp; 

Skyler stood up anyway, lifting Anna in her carrier to the table so she could cover her again.&nbsp; She was thinking that she would need to pick up some bottles so that Chelsea and Frannie could feed the baby while she was gone.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t sure if Chelsea would be able to get past this, but she had warned her before she made the decision to be with her and that was just the way it would always be unless she or Tyler died at some point.&nbsp; Taking Anna back home, Skyler left the boys with Frannie.&nbsp; 

Walking into the house, Skyler put Anna into her crib before going to make the phone call.&nbsp; She set up her night with Tyler for that Friday since she knew Chelsea would be off that night.&nbsp; After she had it all set up, she sat down and cried.

By the time Chelsea returned home, Frannie still had the boys.&nbsp; She insisted she wanted to keep them until after dinner, but Skyler knew it was so she and Chelsea could talk and she had to smile as she hung up the telephone.&nbsp; Chelsea already knew what was going on when she walked in the door.&nbsp; 

Skyler was making dinner as Chelsea grabbed a beer out of the fridge, leaning against it while she looked at Skyler.

�Can we talk about this?�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;ve already done it.�&nbsp; 
�When?�&nbsp; 
�Friday night.�&nbsp; 

Chelsea never said another word, she walked into the bedroom so she could get ready to shower, but all she could do was sit on the edge of the bed and cry.&nbsp; 

She knew it would probably come to this and she had been warned right from the first day, but that didn&#8217;t make it any easier, so deciding there was nothing she could do short of walking into the prison and shooting Tyler, Chelsea got up to take her shower before dinner.

Dinner that night was quiet without the boys, Skyler felt as though her world was falling apart again, but hopefully everyone would be safe if she did what Tyler wanted.&nbsp; She just didn&#8217;t see any other way out of it, knowing every letter had a threat in it, even though the people inspecting them couldn&#8217;t see anything suspicious.&nbsp; They didn&#8217;t know Tyler the way she did, nobody knew him the way she did.&nbsp; He had obviously not lost his ability to keep his true nature hidden from everyone, but her.

�Can I see the letter?�&nbsp; 

Skyler took it out of her jeans pocket, handing it to Chelsea.&nbsp; As she read it, Skyler could see that she had taught her well at being able to read between the lines.&nbsp; 

Chelsea got away from the table and walked towards the bedroom.&nbsp; Skyler could hear her talking to someone on the bedroom phone, waiting patiently for Chelsea to return to the table.&nbsp; Chelsea sat down, handing the letter back to Skyler with a newfound smile and appetite, leaving Skyler to stare at her for a short time.&nbsp; 

�What?�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t wanna say anything yet until we know for sure.�&nbsp; 
�But you seem so happy, shouldn&#8217;t I be able to feel something positive too?�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m just thinking that if he killed his sister and there&#8217;s evidence of him putting something over her face, then maybe, just maybe he can be institutionalized for insanity.&nbsp; He&#8217;s pretty slippery, but it might work and if we can exhume Nikki, Jenny and Joshua, maybe we can do more thorough autopsies.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;ll keep my fingers crossed,� Skyler said, trying to smile.
�You really don&#8217;t have faith in anything I come up with, do you?�&nbsp; 
�That&#8217;s not it and you know it,� Skyler insisted fighting her tears.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m gonna go get the boys, will you watch Anna?�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m here,� Chelsea answered, not looking up from her plate.

Skyler moved away from the table, leaving her dinner sitting untouched while a sudden &#8216;ass-like&#8217; feeling washed over Chelsea.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t going to get angry and suddenly she was pissed off at herself for getting so upset.&nbsp; She felt helpless and was grasping, she knew that, but it was better than not doing anything.&nbsp; 

Skyler didn&#8217;t say much to Frannie when she went for the boys, mostly she just thanked her for keeping them so long.&nbsp; She gave Frannie a hug once the boys were ready before returning to Chelsea&#8217;s house.&nbsp; 

As the boys were taking baths and getting ready for bed, not a word was spoken between her and Chelsea.&nbsp; Once the three young men were settled, Skyler took a shower, put on some pajamas and crawled into bed.&nbsp; She spent most of her time crying until she eventually fell asleep.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t wake up until she heard Anna beginning to cry.&nbsp; 

Crawling out of bed, she realized Chelsea had never made it to bed.&nbsp; While Anna was breast feeding, Skyler walked into the living room to see Chelsea sleeping on the sofa.&nbsp; She walked over, waking her up.

�You should go to bed, I&#8217;ll sleep out here,� Skyler insisted as Chelsea got up, walking past her without saying a word.

Once Anna had been fed and her diaper changed, Skyler put her back into her crib before making her way back out to the sofa.&nbsp; She thought that it might actually be time to go to that shelter.&nbsp; Skyler cried herself to sleep once again, waking up to the feeling of Chelsea sitting beside her on the edge of the sofa.&nbsp; 

�I&#8217;m sorry.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m the one who&#8217;s sorry.&nbsp; I just don&#8217;t know what else to do Chels, tell me what else I can do,� Skyler cried.
�This is what you feel you need to do and I can&#8217;t really tell you what you should do.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;ll actually do any good since he usually follows through on his threats anyway, eventually, but you&#8217;re doing what you think is best.&nbsp; I just don&#8217;t want it to come between us here, so I&#8217;m gonna try not to let it.&nbsp; I just really hate the thought of him touching you again.�&nbsp; 
�Me too.�&nbsp; 
�Maybe you can just keep him talking all night.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m gonna try.�&nbsp; 

Chelsea bent down kissing Skyler and from there it almost turned into so much more until Chelsea remembered she was getting ready for work.&nbsp; Skyler got off the sofa, making Chelsea some breakfast before she needed to leave. 
 
Skyler moved quickly to answer the phone once she heard Val&#8217;s voice on the machine, almost wishing she hadn&#8217;t once Val began trying to dissuade her from seeing Tyler.&nbsp; Skyler listened politely before explaining her side of the situation, but once she had finished, Val realized there would be no talking her out of it and finally wished her luck with the entire situation before saying goodbye.

Chapter 12

The two women never mentioned Tyler until his letter the day before Skyler was supposed to meet with him.&nbsp; As she read it, Skyler began having feelings of anger and fear all at the same time.&nbsp; 

Chelsea had barely closed the door behind her that evening after getting home from work, when Skyler pushed the letter into her hand and then ran to the bathroom so she could throw up after worrying all day had suddenly brought about a wave of nausea.&nbsp; Chelsea followed her, holding Skyler as she hurled, before helping her to sit on the toilet lid and getting her a wet washcloth once she had finished.

�Why does he want you to wear his favorite turtleneck?�&nbsp; 
�Tyler doesn&#8217;t have a favorite turtleneck, he� maybe I shouldn&#8217;t tell you.�
�I want you to tell me,� Chelsea insisted, studying Skyler&#8217;s face.
�Tyler has a favorite game and he use to like to play it a lot, he liked putting me in control of his orgasm.&nbsp; I&#8217;d have to keep my hands against myself while I&#8217;d lean into his hand with my throat and stay there til he either came or I pass out.&nbsp; He was usually happy with either one.�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
��&nbsp; Well that&#8217;s it, you&#8217;re not going,� Chelsea stated, walking out of the bathroom.
�Chels, Chelsea, honey you know I have to go,� Skyler said calmly, following Chelsea into the kitchen.
�I don&#8217;t know anything of the sort.&nbsp; I really don&#8217;t want you to go, I want you to be done getting hurt damn it!�&nbsp; 
�I know you do and I love you for that, but I need to do this.&nbsp; I was with Tyler since I was 16.&nbsp; On our honeymoon he choked me and I know you don&#8217;t wanna hear the rest of this, but you need to know that Tyler seemed to get more excited after he hurt me, than he was before and other than the times when he beat me so bad that I miscarried, he needed me between two and four times a day, so you put that into six years and I pretty much know what he&#8217;s capable of.&nbsp; I also know that he craves me for some sick reason and he&#8217;s just unable to let me go, no matter how much he threatens me, plus he wants out too badly to hurt me too much.&nbsp; Just let me go this once and I promise I&#8217;ll tell him before I leave that I&#8217;m not coming back, if that&#8217;s what you want, but you need to think that through because once I do that, you&#8217;re gonna have your hands full if you plan on protecting everyone.&nbsp; My mother isn&#8217;t gonna be happy and my sister probably has a nice circle of friends at 16,� Skyler warned.
�I don&#8217;t need to think about it, if I don&#8217;t want you going now, I certainly don&#8217;t want you ever going again.&nbsp; I already have people standing by, waiting for the day he gets out, so just don&#8217;t go,� She insisted, holding Skyler tightly.
�I have to go, I don&#8217;t know why, but it&#8217;s a strong feeling that I just have to go, I&#8217;m sorry, but I have to go with what I feel needs to be done.&nbsp; I know it&#8217;s horrible to say, but I wanted them to find him guilty of everything and bring back the death penalty, just for him.&nbsp; I use to dream about it when I was going to his trial.� 
�I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s so horrible, I saw those boys when you were in the hospital.&nbsp; It was pretty obvious you were the only thing in their lives that made them feel safe.�&nbsp; 
�I always tried.&nbsp; I just hope and pray that none of them have his disease.&nbsp; That scares me the most.�&nbsp; 
�I think they&#8217;re gonna be fine.&nbsp; They seem to keep a pretty close eye on one another.&nbsp; They all share really well, even Logan.�&nbsp; 

Skyler had a faraway look in her eyes as she listened to Chelsea try convincing her the children would all be fine, she could only hope the wonderful officer in her arms was right.

Chapter 13

With a dread dwelling in the pit of her stomach, Friday arrived all too soon.&nbsp; Skyler had been feeling nervous from the day the letter had arrived, but then, so was Chelsea.&nbsp; Frannie spent most of the day with them, trying to keep things relatively calm, but happy moments were few and far between.&nbsp; Skyler did smile when Frannie let the boys play with the cookie fixings, making them sticky from head to toe, even managing to laugh as they excitedly stood in front of the oven to watch their creations bake.&nbsp; 

The happiness was short-lived as Skyler put some breast milk into the fridge before Chelsea drove her to the prison.&nbsp; Skyler kissed Chelsea before hesitantly going inside.&nbsp; 

Once she was ready to enter the private room, the guards made her expose her neck so they could take pictures.&nbsp; Skyler was silently thanking Chelsea before entering the room where she paced as she waited for Tyler to arrive.&nbsp; 

The guards winked at Tyler as they patted him on the back before closing the door behind him.&nbsp; 

�I see you got some new friends.&nbsp; Are they the ones that let you know what I&#8217;m doing?�&nbsp; 
�Well hello to you too wife.�&nbsp; 
�Hello Tyler, you look like you&#8217;ve lost some weight.�&nbsp; 
�You look like you&#8217;ve put some on.�&nbsp; 
�I just had a baby, but then you already knew that,� Skyler remarked, looking down the moment Tyler glared at her.&nbsp; 
�You got any pictures?�&nbsp; 
�I brought some of us all,� she said, pointing to them on the table.

Tyler walked over to look at them and the expression of regret washing over his face almost made Skyler cry, it seemed so sincere.&nbsp; 

�She looks like you.�&nbsp; 
�You think so?�&nbsp; 
�Yeah.&nbsp; We make some cute kids, don&#8217;t we?�&nbsp; 
�Adorable.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m getting a new trial.�&nbsp; 
�Oh?�&nbsp; 
�Aren&#8217;t you happy?�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t really know what that means.&nbsp; Did they find something new?�&nbsp; 
�My lawyer thinks he can get all the charges dropped, I could be outta here in a couple of weeks.�&nbsp; 

Skyler felt her heart drop when she heard Tyler&#8217;s &#8216;good news&#8217;.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t expecting this so soon, but no matter what happened she had no intention of sitting through this trial.&nbsp; Naturally she had no intention of saying anything negative until she was leaving.

�So I should start making plans for the kids?�&nbsp; 
�That&#8217;s my girl,� he said, walking over to hug her.

Tyler began undressing Skyler as she stood there in shock.&nbsp; She was trying to think of anything she could to delay him.

�Can&#8217;t we talk for a while Tyler?�&nbsp; 
�We already did,� he said, taking off her turtleneck, pushing her hair away from her face.
�But we haven&#8217;t talked about anything important, like where we&#8217;re gonna live or what you&#8217;re gonna do to support us.�&nbsp; 
�And since when have I ever told you anything anyway?�&nbsp; 
�If you need to do this, will you at least use the condoms?�&nbsp; 
�You sick of having my kids Skyler?�&nbsp; 
�I just don&#8217;t wanna keep having babies that you don&#8217;t want anyway.&nbsp; I love the kids, but it&#8217;s not fair to them when you don&#8217;t want anything to do with &#8216;em.�&nbsp; 
�I think someone&#8217;s had too much time to start thinking for themselves and maybe someone should just finish undressing before that someone &#8216;pisses&#8217; me off,� Tyler whispered.

It was surprising to Skyler how quickly she fell back into taking orders from him, but it didn&#8217;t help that she was still in shock by what he had told her.&nbsp; By the time she had undressed, Tyler was already in the bed waiting for her.&nbsp; Skyler crawled into the bed, trying to shut down her mind as Tyler crawled on top of her, kissing her passionately before putting a hand over her mouth.&nbsp; 

�Have you been having fun with your little lesbian slut?�&nbsp; Tyler hissed, as Skyler&#8217;s eyes opened wide.&nbsp; �I know all about what you&#8217;ve been doing with that bitch cop.&nbsp; You planned it from the first time you went outside with her, didn&#8217;t you?!�&nbsp; He rasped as Skyler violently shook her head, beginning to cry.&nbsp; �Remember what I said when you brought my son to see me?�&nbsp; He asked as she nodded.&nbsp; �Now you get to see part of what&#8217;s gonna happen when I get outta here, hope you&#8217;re ready,� Skyler tried pulling his hand off her mouth as he pushed harder.&nbsp; �Has she been touching these?�&nbsp; Tyler asked, leaning back to give Skyler&#8217;s nipples each a very violent twist as she screamed into his hand.&nbsp; �Oh, she has, and does she kiss you all along here?�&nbsp; He asked as he slid off of her, keeping one leg across her legs to hold her down as he began pinching and twisting the skin all around her stomach as she screamed.&nbsp; �And what about my favorite part?&nbsp; Has she been satisfying you?�&nbsp; Tyler asked as he grabbed her pussy, squeezing as her screams continued to go unheard.

Without removing his hand from her mouth, Tyler quickly rolled Skyler onto her stomach, making her cry even more since she knew what was coming.&nbsp; Tyler quickly repositioned his hand over her mouth, mercilessly shoving his penis into her anus as he began to pound into her with a force like never before.&nbsp; Through it all, he continued pinching and twisting her skin all along her back and her buttocks.&nbsp; As Tyler finished cumming inside her, he leaned his head beside hers.

�Shush now if you know what&#8217;s good for you,� Tyler warned, removing his hand from her mouth.&nbsp; �We&#8217;re gonna play my favorite game now.�&nbsp; 

Tyler lay on his back as Skyler brushed the tears from her face.&nbsp; She attempted to touch his penis, hoping to at least get him hard first so she wouldn&#8217;t pass out, but he slapped her across the head.&nbsp; She managed not to scream, but a small grunt of surprise did escape her mouth.

�No cheating, or should I say, no more cheating.�&nbsp; 

Skyler knew there was no way she would be able to do what he wanted without passing out, but she did what she was told, straddling him before sliding her pussy along his stomach.&nbsp; She was thankful to find that he was already getting hard again as she positioned herself over his penis until it began pushing inside her.&nbsp; Skyler wrapped her hands around herself before leaning her throat into his hand.&nbsp; At that very moment, she realized she wasn&#8217;t passing this time, because he didn&#8217;t want her to.&nbsp; Tyler had pulled his arm back, creating such an angle that it wouldn&#8217;t be very long before she was passing out.

Tyler had been so happy when he knew Skyler was actually willing to spend the night, but then he began thinking about the fact that she was actually living with someone else and letting them touch her voluntarily.&nbsp; She was with another woman, so it really didn&#8217;t mean anything, but she was enjoying herself without him and that was just wrong since she was his wife.&nbsp; She belonged to him and she still didn&#8217;t understand that, even after all the years of telling her.&nbsp; She was trying to pull away from him and she needed to be taught a lesson.&nbsp; She needed to know that being with him forever wasn&#8217;t a choice.

When Skyler leaned against Tyler&#8217;s hand and he pulled back on it, he could see the trepidation in her eyes, but she never panicked or grabbed at his hand, instead she allowed herself to go limp.&nbsp; 

He thought about letting her slip away, but only for a split second because he couldn&#8217;t stand the thought of being alive without her, so he lowered her unconscious body down to the bed, making sure she was still breathing.&nbsp; 

As he rolled her limp body over, he pushed her hair out of her face, crying as he cradled her in his arms.&nbsp; Tyler didn&#8217;t cry for very long before spreading her legs and thrusting his cock vehemently into Skyler&#8217;s vagina, finishing what she had started.&nbsp; 

Tyler smiled at the thought of her leaving him and being pregnant again.&nbsp; At some point that stupid fucking cop would throw her ass out of the house and he would be waiting with open arms.

Skyler began coming to as Tyler was ejaculating inside her.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t positive what had come over her, but she was hoping he would calm down if she told him he was hurting her.&nbsp; Instead he clamped his hand over her mouth the moment she tried speaking.&nbsp; For emphasis, Tyler gave her a short, solid punch in the stomach.&nbsp; As all the air was pushed out of her nostrils, her snot drenched the back of his hand.&nbsp; He was so disgusted with her that he ordered her to lick it off, almost making her throw up.&nbsp; He seemed pleased with the fact that she was remembering her place quite nicely.&nbsp; 

Apparently the thought of pushing her around again was keeping him at a steady hard, because no sooner had she finished, he was pushing his penis inside her again.&nbsp; That time she did manage to tell him she was sore, making him slam against her pussy with even more force.&nbsp; He must have continued slamming into her for 20 minutes before he was ejaculating again.&nbsp; 

As he clamped his hand over her mouth, he punched her one more time in the stomach.&nbsp; Skyler was barely conscious as he flipped her over again, ramming his penis into her asshole again, but she was too weak by then to do much more than moan and that seemed to turn him more as he began fucking her vigorously up the ass again.&nbsp; 

Throughout the remainder of the night, Skyler was blessed with being unconscious more often than she was actually aware of what was happening to her.&nbsp; Several times she came to as Tyler was going down on her, bringing her to orgasm.&nbsp; Those were the times she hated her body&#8217;s betrayal as Tyler would smile as her hips would automatically thrust her pussy into his face. Thankfully, after being pinched and punched so many times, she had become insensible.&nbsp; 

Skyler felt her body being tugged as she opened her eyes.&nbsp; Tyler was fully dressed and had begun trying to get her dressed before the guards showed up.&nbsp; He smiled at her, kissing her on the cheek before pulling the turtleneck over her head.&nbsp; 

She began to sit up, wincing from the indescribable pain in her body.&nbsp; As she finished putting her shirt on, Tyler was getting a washcloth so she could run it over her face.&nbsp; Skyler stood up, but she needed to move very carefully since her ribs hurt.&nbsp; Tyler walked up to her, hugging and kissing her before leaning his head beside hers.

�This was just to punish you for what you&#8217;ve been doing.&nbsp; Now d&#8217;you know that you&#8217;re mine and you&#8217;ll always be mine?�&nbsp; Tyler asked as Skyler nodded in agreement, at least until she had protection.

When the guards were at last leading Tyler out of the room, Skyler asked them to wait a minute as she forced herself to stand up.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
�This was the last time Tyler.�&nbsp; 
�What&#8217;s that mean?�&nbsp; Tyler asked with a smile.
�That means that I&#8217;m not coming back to you anymore, I&#8217;m done being abused and I don&#8217;t wanna leave my babies anywhere,� Skyler stated boldly.
�I&#8217;ll never give you a divorce.�&nbsp; 
�Maybe not, but you&#8217;ll never hurt me again either.&nbsp; I know everyone thinks you&#8217;re a wonderful person, but I have people on my side now too.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;ve never done anything to you that you haven&#8217;t asked for.�&nbsp; .
�I&#8217;ve never asked for this,� she insisted, pulling down her collar, �or this,� she added, lifting her top to reveal the bruises and pinch marks on her stomach and back.
�You fucking bitch!&nbsp; She tricked me!&nbsp; She&#8217;s lying!&nbsp; She begged me to do that to her!�&nbsp; Tyler screamed as the guards carried him out of the room.

Pictures were taken before Skyler left the prison.&nbsp; She tried walking normally as she left, but it entered her mind that she might have some problems with her ribs.&nbsp; 

Chelsea could tell something was wrong before she even saw Skyler.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t explain it, but she could feel that Skyler wasn&#8217;t okay.&nbsp; As soon as she laid eyes on her lover&#8217;s face, she jumped out of the car and ran to her.

�You okay?�&nbsp; Chelsea asked, putting her arm around the hunched woman and helping her to the car.
�I should&#8217;ve listened to you.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry Chelsea, I guess I&#8217;ve been away from it for too long, I must&#8217;ve gotten soft or something,� Skyler suggested with a weak smile.
�I&#8217;m taking you to the hospital,� Chelsea informed her.&nbsp; �Did you tell him you weren&#8217;t coming back anymore?�&nbsp; She asked.&nbsp; �Is that why he did this?�&nbsp; 
�No, that&#8217;s not why he did this, this was just to punish me for thinking I could be free, but yeah, I did tell him I was finished.�&nbsp; 
�What&#8217;d he say?�&nbsp; 
�He called me a fucking bitch and a liar before he told the guards I begged him to hurt me,� Skyler said with a sick laugh before flinching from the pain.
�That sick bastard needs to be dead.�&nbsp; 
�I agree, but we probably shouldn&#8217;t say that to too many people.�&nbsp; 
�I guess,� Chelsea agreed with a small smile.
�You&#8217;d think you&#8217;d know that, being a cop and all,� Skyler said, both women chuckling until Skyler winced from the pain again.

Skyler was relaxing on the sofa after having her ribs taped up.&nbsp; Her night with Tyler, left the woman with two broken ribs, along with so many bruises flowing together, it looked more like one giant bruise covering her entire body.&nbsp; 

Chelsea helped her wash up when they got home before helping her into some pajamas and setting her up in the living room.&nbsp; The sight of her made the boys cling to her again and she knew they remembered, making her cry.&nbsp; She had to stop it all, she didn&#8217;t want them to be affected by their father for the rest of their lives.&nbsp; 

Skyler looked at Chelsea as she sat at the other end of the sofa while Frannie was making them all some lunch.

�What d&#8217;you suppose I would need to do to at least start divorce proceedings?�&nbsp; 
�I guess I&#8217;ll check into it for you on Monday.�&nbsp; 
�Thank you Chelsea.�&nbsp; 
�Thank you Sky.�&nbsp; 
�I should&#8217;ve listened to you to begin with.&nbsp; They haven&#8217;t helped him at all, that&#8217;s for sure.�&nbsp; 
�I hate daddy,� Hunter said so quietly, Skyler barely heard him.&nbsp; 
�What did you just say sweetie?�&nbsp; 
�I hate daddy,� he repeated.
�Don&#8217;t ever say that you hate your daddy sweetie,� Skyler almost whispered.&nbsp; �Daddy can&#8217;t help how he is.&nbsp; Your daddy&#8217;s very, very sick and some people that need to help him don&#8217;t know how sick he is and your daddy doesn&#8217;t know how sick he is.�&nbsp; 
�But he hurts you,� Hunter added.
�That&#8217;s because he&#8217;s sick baby.&nbsp; When I knew your daddy before, he was a sweet boy.&nbsp; He&#8217;s just sick in a way that most people can&#8217;t see, hopefully, someday someone will make your daddy all better and he can show you how much he really loves you.&nbsp; Probably just as much as I do� almost,� Skyler assured him, kissing his head.
�I&#8217;m sorry mommy.� 
�That&#8217;s okay sweetie.&nbsp; You said what you felt and there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that.�&nbsp; 

Chelsea, in that moment knew she had fallen in love with an extremely special woman.&nbsp; Anyone who could go through what Skyler had with Tyler and still look at her children, telling them not to hate the person they had watched hurt their mother over and over again, had to be pretty special and definitely worth holding onto.&nbsp; All Chelsea could do was smile at them all.

�Why&#8217;re you smiling?�&nbsp; 
�No reason in particular, I just think you&#8217;re amazing.�&nbsp; 
�Well, as long as you don&#8217;t get obsessive about it, I think we&#8217;ll be fine.�&nbsp; 

At that moment, Frannie walked into the living room asking if anyone was hungry enough to eat all their lunch before brownies.&nbsp; Skyler raised her hand until the boys got off her, then she had to muffle a gasp from the pain of them moving.&nbsp; 

Chelsea began to jump up until Skyler held out her hand.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t want her to move until the boys were gone, not wanting them to know they had hurt her.&nbsp; She motioned for Chelsea once the boys had vanished with Frannie.

�I didn&#8217;t wanna upset them,� she said, tears surfacing.
�What can I do?&nbsp; I&#8217;m afraid to touch you.�&nbsp; 
�If you just hold the pillow, I think I can do the rest.�&nbsp; 

Chelsea couldn&#8217;t stop herself from wishing Tyler were dead again as she watched the gentle woman in front of her struggle in pain.&nbsp; 

Once Skyler was adjusted, Chelsea gave her a Kleenex to wipe her eyes before she leaned down, gently kissing her.&nbsp; 

Skyler smiled as Frannie brought in her lunch.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t finish it all, but she still got a brownie.&nbsp; 

Skyler had just begun to relax again when there was a knock at the door.&nbsp; She smiled as Matt, Val and the girls walk into the house.

�The woman definitely takes a lickin&#8217; and keeps on ticken&#8217;, doesn&#8217;t she?�&nbsp; Val asked Chelsea as she bent down to kiss Skyler on the cheek.
�Hopefully not anymore,� Chelsea remarked.&nbsp; 
�I definitely didn&#8217;t hold up very well for this round.�&nbsp; 
�The man does seem to have a thing for your throat, doesn&#8217;t he?�&nbsp; Val asked, cringing slightly.
�You girls should go play or see if nana has anymore cookies,� Chelsea suggested.
�Only one!�&nbsp; Matt shouted.
�God, that was loud,� Skyler said, wincing.
�Sorry, but the last time they were here it took us four hours to settle them down after we got home,� Matt explained.
�Oh let &#8216;em have fun,� Val insisted, giving him a look.
�Fine,� Matt pouted, slumping in a chair.
�You two okay?�&nbsp; Chelsea asked.
�He&#8217;s just being a baby.�&nbsp; 
�Ouch,� Chelsea said, looking at Matt.
�Am not, she&#8217;s just being a bitch,� Matt stated, returning the look to Val.
�Double ouch,� Skyler added.&nbsp; �You guys gonna be okay?�&nbsp; 
�We&#8217;ll be fine, I think he&#8217;s pre-menstrual,� Val said, smiling at him.
�And with that, Matt, wanna help me get some coffee and cookies?�&nbsp; Chelsea asked.
�Gladly� but none for her,� Matt instructed as they left the room.
�You sure you guys are okay?�&nbsp; 
�We&#8217;re fine, he&#8217;s just being a jackass,� Val said as she sat down.&nbsp; �Enough about the jerk, how&#8217;re you doing?�&nbsp; 
�Better now, the boys were laying on me until lunch and cookies.�&nbsp; 
�They&#8217;re good boys.�&nbsp; 
�I just hope they keep it up.&nbsp; I guess I&#8217;m finally beginning to realize that being around their father might do more harm than good.&nbsp; I think it&#8217;s time to think about divorce.&nbsp; Chelsea&#8217;s gonna look into it for me.�&nbsp; 
�Good idea,� Val agreed, staring into the kitchen.
�Why you saying that like that?�&nbsp; 
�Oh don&#8217;t listen to me, it&#8217;s just been a rough couple of weeks.�&nbsp; 
�Well, I could always return the favor if you feel like talking.&nbsp; I&#8217;m a good listener,� Skyler offered with a small smile.&nbsp; �Not so good at the advice, but I listen very well.�&nbsp; 

Matt and Chelsea walked back into the living room about then so Skyler mostly observed as the other three ate, drank and glared.&nbsp; Chelsea attempted to steer their attention into conversations, but eventually the stress of it all forced Skyler to shut her eyes, falling asleep almost immediately.&nbsp; When she did wake up, they had gone and Chelsea was getting the boys ready for bed with a little assistance from Frannie.&nbsp; Once the boys were settled, Frannie and Chelsea walked into the living room.

�How you feeling sweetie?�&nbsp; 
�Tired still.&nbsp; Hasn&#8217;t Anna woken up yet?�&nbsp; 
�There was still one bottle left so I fed her that and let you sleep,� Chelsea explained.
�Oh, okay, thank you.&nbsp; What was going on with Matt and Val?�&nbsp; 
�She apparently told him something that happened to her when she was a kid and he&#8217;s having a hard time with it.�&nbsp; 
�She told him?&nbsp; What&#8217;s his problem?�&nbsp; 
�She told you?�&nbsp; Chelsea asked, sounding surprised.
�Well� maybe it was the whole common ground thing, or maybe she just thought that if she shared something with me, I&#8217;d share with her, I don&#8217;t know,� Skyler suggested.&nbsp; �So what&#8217;s his problem then?�&nbsp; 
�Gee Sky, I don&#8217;t know, maybe it&#8217;s all about keeping it a secret for all the years they were married.&nbsp; For him I think it&#8217;s a whole trust issue.&nbsp; You think you can understand that?� 
�I didn&#8217;t mean to upset you� I&#8217;m sorry Chels,� Skyler said, looking down at her shaking hands.
�You need to straighten up and stop being an ass,� Frannie spouted at Chelsea before standing up.&nbsp; �The girl has put up with enough shit in her life and she doesn&#8217;t need it from you too!&nbsp; You&#8217;re making me angry now, so I&#8217;m going home!�&nbsp; Frannie was almost shouting.
�I&#8217;ll walk you.�&nbsp; 
�No you won&#8217;t!&nbsp; I don&#8217;t need to look at your dumb-ass face anymore tonight.&nbsp; You get some rest sweetie and don&#8217;t mind my daughter, she doesn&#8217;t mean to be such a moron,� Frannie said as Skyler tried to smile.
�Goodnight Frannie, thank you for everything.� 

The two women watched as Frannie stormed out of the house with shaking her head, too angry to say goodbye to Chelsea.
 
�Are you keeping certain things from me Sky?�&nbsp; 
�I guess, I just don&#8217;t think you can handle hearing some stuff and I don&#8217;t wanna upset you or have you look at me differently either.�&nbsp; 
�Why don&#8217;t you think you can tell me?&nbsp; You can tell me anything.�&nbsp; 

The ridiculousness of that one statement bordered Skyler&#8217;s emotions between hysterical laughter and complete anger, she tried very hard to find a middle-ground. 

�Oh really?&nbsp; Did you wanna hear how I lipped off one time too many and found myself being pushed face first onto the kitchen table and fucked in the ass so hard that he ruptured me and I had to clean up my own blood?&nbsp; Is that the stuff you wanna hear Chels?&nbsp; How about the way he use to get me from behind when I was washing dishes, just to see if I&#8217;d use the knife on him that I&#8217;d be washing at the time and how much more it turned him on when I couldn&#8217;t do it and would drop the knife!&nbsp; Did you want me to start at the beginning and how he made me give him blowjob after he raped me, making me swallow my own blood off his penis?!&nbsp; You want more?�&nbsp; Skyler asked as her voice began quivering and tears made their way to the surface as she stared at Chelsea.
�I&#8217;m sorry,� Chelsea said in her own shaky voice.&nbsp; �I guess you were right.�&nbsp; 

Chelsea never said another word as she got out of the chair and vanished into the bedroom.&nbsp; 

Skyler closed her eyes again, crying herself to sleep.

Opening her eyes, Skyler smiled when she heard the boys getting loud in the kitchen as they spoke about a surprise for her.&nbsp; She heard Frannie explaining that if they didn&#8217;t keep it down, there would be no surprise and then they got quiet again, making Skyler smile even more.&nbsp; 

She closed her eyes when she heard them coming, only opening them after feeling tiny little lips kissing her on the cheek.&nbsp; As soon as she opened her eyes, they all shouted &#8216;surprise&#8217; at her and once she was sitting up, they served her breakfast.

�This is a wonderful surprise boys, I love it and it looks delicious, thank you.&nbsp; Chelsea gone already?�&nbsp; 
�She said she had a busy day.�&nbsp; 
�Are you sad mommy?�&nbsp; Hunter asked as he studied his mother.
�How could I possibly be sad when I have such a yummy looking breakfast being brought to me by my three favorite boys?� 

The boys were very proud of themselves as Frannie sent them off to play before she sat beside Skyler.

�So what happened?�&nbsp; 
�She told me she could handle whatever I told her, but she couldn&#8217;t.�&nbsp; 
�I still don&#8217;t understand how I could&#8217;ve raised such a stupid child,� Frannie spouted.
�She&#8217;s not, maybe she&#8217;s just starting to realize that it really was just pity that brought us together.�&nbsp; 
�Only my stupid daughter could find herself an equally stupid girlfriend.&nbsp; I need a break,� Frannie stated, returning to the kitchen.

Skyler was slightly confused by Frannie&#8217;s behavior as she began eating her breakfast, making sure to let the boys know again how wonderful it was.&nbsp; At that point Tristan ran over to her, whispering in his mother&#8217;s ear that nana made it, they just helped bring it to her.&nbsp; Skyler thanked him for not keeping any secrets from her before he ran back to his brothers.

Just before Chelsea was suppose to be home, Frannie took Anna to Skyler after a diaper change so she could be fed.&nbsp; Skyler&#8217;s nipples hurt so much, she was just barely able to tolerate the pain of feeding her daughter, but looking at the little girl in her arms took her mind off the pain.&nbsp; Noticing the activity in the entry, Skyler watched Frannie and the boys as they dressed before leaving her and Anna alone.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Skyler sat, stunned as the entire process took place without Frannie saying a word.&nbsp; Skyler held Anna as she slept, continuing to look lovingly at the child.&nbsp; When the phone rang, she listened as Chelsea spoke to the answering machine, explaining how she had to work late and had no idea how long she would be gone.&nbsp; 

Skyler forced herself to get up so she could take Anna back to her crib before taking a shower and laying out the boys&#8217; pajamas.&nbsp; Skyler did as much as she could prior to calling Frannie and telling her about Chelsea&#8217;s phone call.&nbsp; By the time Frannie returned with the boys, she was fuming, becoming frustrated when she saw the things Skyler had been doing while she had been left alone.&nbsp; 

Silently Frannie helped rewrap her ribs before escorting her back to the sofa and getting the boys ready for bed.&nbsp; Frannie walked back into the living room when all of the children had been settled in for the night.

�I&#8217;m sleeping with the boys tonight and I don&#8217;t care where you two idiots sleep, but if you need me, just let me know,� Frannie spouted before turning around and leaving her alone.

Chapter 14

Skyler glanced at the clock when she heard the front door open, noticing the clock said it was 3 a.m.&nbsp; 

Chelsea began walking through the living room, even though she noticed Skyler staring at her.&nbsp; She had gone into the kitchen, but immediately reappeared in the living room, sitting on the coffee table in front of Skyler.

�Here&#8217;s the thing��&nbsp; 
�You wanna be able to handle the things I could tell you, but they hit too close to home and you can&#8217;t.�&nbsp; 
�No, I just love you so much that when you tell me stuff like that, it just makes me wanna walk into the prison and blow that bastard&#8217;s head off.�&nbsp; 
�I love you too,� Skyler returned.&nbsp; �That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t wanna tell you all the shit.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want you feeling sorry for me.&nbsp; I can get through almost anything, as long as you actually love me and you&#8217;re not just keeping us here because you pity me.�&nbsp; 
�I have never felt sorry for you.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve admired you for your strength and I&#8217;ve felt bad for not being able to get you away from that madman sooner, but I&#8217;ve never pitied you,� Chelsea insisted.&nbsp; �Are you with me because you love me, or are you with me because you feel grateful?�&nbsp; 
�I know I was very grateful to you at first and I&#8217;m not exactly sure when that changed, but I think the fact that you pissed me off when you left a message on the machine would say that I most definitely don&#8217;t feel grateful anymore.&nbsp; I love you and if you think that you can avoid me just because you&#8217;re upset, well I just want you to know that I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s fair when I&#8217;m stuck here and can&#8217;t get to you.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t like it and I don&#8217;t appreciate it.�&nbsp; 
�Okay.�&nbsp; 
�Okay?�&nbsp; 
�Okay, I won&#8217;t do that anymore.&nbsp; If we&#8217;re having a problem, we&#8217;ll talk everything over before it gets that bad again.�&nbsp; 
�Good, now how&#8217;re Matt and Val doing?�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re doing as well, he&#8217;s still pretty upset about the trust issue.�&nbsp; 
�Why is he so dense?&nbsp; It has nothing to do with trust, it has to do with her fear that he&#8217;s gonna look at her differently after finding out.&nbsp; It&#8217;s like waking up from a nightmare, you&#8217;re just happy when it&#8217;s finally over.�&nbsp; 
�Hold that thought,� Chelsea said, grabbing the phone before going into the kitchen.

Skyler began to get off the sofa as she heard Chelsea talking on the phone.&nbsp; By the time she managed to stand, Chelsea was back in the living room, taking hold of Skyler&#8217;s arm.

�What&#8217;re you doing?�&nbsp; Chelsea asked after hanging up the phone.
�If you think I&#8217;m sleeping alone tonight, you&#8217;re outta your mind,� Skyler informed her.&nbsp; �I wonder if your mother put your pajamas in the guest room.�&nbsp; 
�Is she here?�&nbsp; 
�Yeah, she&#8217;s sleeping with the boys in our bed.&nbsp; Did you know she called me stupid?�&nbsp; Skyler asked as they began walking towards the guest room.
�She usually saves that for me.�&nbsp; 
�Well, I guess she kinda did, she said only her stupid daughter could find herself an equally stupid girlfriend,� Skyler tattled.&nbsp; �I was kinda hurt and I definitely didn&#8217;t know what to say back to her.�&nbsp; 
�I can imagine.&nbsp; She&#8217;s a firecracker when she gets going,� Chelsea laughed.&nbsp; �She adores you though.�&nbsp; 
�I adore her too, that&#8217;s why I was so shocked.&nbsp; I would never talk to her that way.�&nbsp; 
�So tell &#8216;er.&nbsp; She&#8217;s more like your mother than mine anyways.�&nbsp; 
�You&#8217;re so full of shit,� Skyler laughed, grabbing her stomach.

Chelsea apologized as she laughed again before helping Skyler get into the bed before stripping down to her underwear and crawling into bed beside Skyler.&nbsp; The injured woman carefully slid herself to partially lie on Chelsea before both women fell asleep.&nbsp; 

The following morning, Val called to thank Skyler for talking to Chelsea who then spoke to Matt and made him see where she was coming from.&nbsp; She told Skyler that Matt woke her up at almost four in the morning to talk and by five they were making love.&nbsp; Skyler laughed as she congratulated her and had to hang up so she could tell Chelsea the entire story.

Chapter 15

Several weeks later, Skyler could finally move around again without pain shooting through her ribs.&nbsp; Dealing with the children had been especially painful, but she tried her best not to let the boys see her hurting in any way.&nbsp; 

During Skyler&#8217;s recovery, Chelsea had been keeping a very close eye on Tyler.&nbsp; Apparently he had gotten into a bit of trouble for hurting Skyler, especially since they had before and after photographs.&nbsp; He continued insisting she liked it rough, but for some reason certain people were beginning to have their doubts where Tyler was concerned.&nbsp; 

Tyler was becoming increasingly unhappy after being served with the divorce papers.&nbsp; He had been pushing his lawyer even harder after that, insisting he couldn&#8217;t fix his marriage as long as he was sitting in prison.&nbsp; His lawyer was doing what he could, but it seemed to be making Tyler even more agitated.

With the kids all tucked in and asleep, Skyler and Chelsea sat on the sofa to snuggle and watch a movie.&nbsp; Skyler was nervous and fidgety, but Chelsea was pretty sure she knew why.

�Are you happy about it?�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t know, you know I love my babies; but&#8217;re you upset?�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t know; I&#8217;ve never seen kids like yours.&nbsp; They&#8217;re great kids and they watch out for each other, even Logan and he&#8217;s so young yet.&nbsp; I do love &#8216;em you know.�&nbsp; 
�I know you do.&nbsp; Five is a lot of kids though and they&#8217;re all so young.�&nbsp; 
�You get pregnant really easy, don&#8217;t you?�&nbsp; 
�Let&#8217;s just say that if I saw a sperm bank down the street, I&#8217;d take another street,� Skyler commented as Chelsea laughed.
�I&#8217;d love another baby in the house,� Chelsea said, kissing Skyler on the head.
�I sure did get lucky the day you came to the door.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m pretty sure that I&#8217;m the lucky one.�&nbsp; 

Chapter 16

Three months had passed before the divorce hearing, but Tyler still hadn&#8217;t had his trial.&nbsp; When Skyler spoke with the judge, she gave a detailed account of her six years with Tyler and how she thought he was getting help for his tendencies, but after her overnight visit showed he was the same, she didn&#8217;t think their children needed to be put through anymore since they were getting older and were more observant of their surroundings.&nbsp; She made sure to explain Tyler&#8217;s treatment of the boys and his solution to any girls he thought she might be carrying.&nbsp; 

The judge found Tyler to be quite charming during the initial visit, deciding he would like to talk to Hunter for a more objective opinion.&nbsp; The judge was positive that Hunter would be able to remember at least a few things, even though he was only five.&nbsp; Skyler had been against it, but her lawyer insisted Hunter would be fine and Tyler wouldn&#8217;t be anywhere near him, so after some discussion, she agreed.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Hunter was dressed up in a little shirt and tie when he went in to see the judge.&nbsp; He had been clinging to his mother, but she explained to him that he would need to talk to the nice judge without her and if he could just be a big boy and do that, as long as he told the truth, everything would be okay.

The young man continued staring over his shoulder, not taking his eyes off his mother until the judge had shut the door behind them

Skyler was feeling extremely guilty, not even positive Hunter would be able to remember anything.&nbsp; She was positive the entire experience was going to traumatize him for absolutely no reason.&nbsp; They had never discussed any of it because she didn&#8217;t want him having nightmares and now he was going to have to live through it all over again.&nbsp; Hopefully it would be the last time.

Frannie was waiting with them to take Hunter for ice cream as soon as he was finished.&nbsp; The other kids were staying with Matt and Val until the hearing was over.&nbsp; Skyler couldn&#8217;t stop worrying about Hunter the entire time he was in the judge&#8217;s chambers.&nbsp; 

When he walked out an hour later, he was holding the judges hand until he saw his mother, running to her as she squatted to give him a huge hug.

�Are you okay sweetie?�&nbsp; 
�He&#8217;s a nice man mommy.�&nbsp; 
�That&#8217;s good baby, you go with nana now, and I&#8217;ll see you when we get home.�&nbsp; 
�I love you mommy.�&nbsp; 
�Ooh, I love you too sweetie,� Skyler said, giving him another hug.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re such a big boy.�&nbsp; 

The judge watched, laughing as Hunter held Frannie&#8217;s hand and skipped down the hall, until the elevator opened, causing him to freeze in his tracks.&nbsp; Skyler watched as Tyler was led out of the elevator in shackles with a guard on either side of him. 

As Tyler noticed Hunter, his expression began changing.&nbsp; Hunter stared at him, but only for a second before his eyes automatically averted to the floor and he hugged Frannie&#8217;s leg.&nbsp; Tyler wasn&#8217;t prepared for the situation and all the years he had mistreated Hunter were about to catch up with him.

�You got a hug for your dad?�&nbsp; Tyler asked, squatting down.
�But you don&#8217;t like when I touch you daddy,� Hunter said quietly.
�He&#8217;s lying; he&#8217;s a rotten little liar!�&nbsp; 
�Frannie, please take him now,� Skyler instructed, moving rapidly towards them.
�You&#8217;ve poisoned him you fucking dyke!�&nbsp; 

Skyler didn&#8217;t care what Tyler said to her, she just wanted Hunter gone so he wouldn&#8217;t have to listen to anymore.&nbsp; 

Frannie was hurrying him down the stairs as fast as she could and once they were out of sight, Skyler turned to Tyler.

�I didn&#8217;t have to poison him Tyler; you did that a long time ago.&nbsp; I just hope you get help so you can see how special he really is,� she said, walking past him, back to Chelsea.&nbsp; 

The judge had already vanished back into his chambers by then.

�Fucking dyke!�&nbsp; Tyler shouted as the guards pushed him into the courtroom.

Skyler was trying to keep from shaking as she sat down.&nbsp; She let Chelsea attempt to calm her down, but she couldn&#8217;t seem to stop the trembling.

�I just hope Hunter&#8217;s okay, I don&#8217;t want him having nightmares over this.�&nbsp; 
�Did Tyler really not want Hunter touching him?�&nbsp; 
�Hunter was just learning to walk and he grabbed Tyler&#8217;s leg so he could move along and Tyler told him not to touch him and shook his leg, knocking him down.&nbsp; That was one of the few times he didn&#8217;t actually hit me for swearing at him,� Skyler said, giving a sick laugh.
�I&#8217;m sorry you had to deal with all that for so long.&nbsp; I just wish I could&#8217;ve gotten you away from him sooner.�&nbsp; 
�Yeah, but if you had, I wouldn&#8217;t have Logan or Anna or whoever we have coming next,� Skyler smiled, putting a hand to her stomach.

Skyler stood up when she saw her lawyer, Linda, walking towards them.&nbsp; Linda smiled at Chelsea and Skyler as she approached and directly behind her, Val had shown up for moral support, explaining that Matt&#8217;s mother had stopped by the house to help with the kids and since she was baking cookies when Val left, she was sure they would be fine.&nbsp; Skyler smiled before giving Val a hug, thanking her for showing up. 
 
The four of them walked into the courtroom together, Chelsea and Val sitting in the back. 
 
As Skyler and Linda made their way up front, Tyler glared at them both until he had to stand when the judge entered the courtroom.&nbsp; 

�I need to tell you Mr. and Mrs. Lasko that your little guy, Hunter is one of the most exceptional children I have ever spoken with.&nbsp; He&#8217;s a smart little boy and he knows what&#8217;s going on.&nbsp; All I have to say to you Mr. Lasko is that I hope you get the help you need and I&#8217;m putting in a recommendation for exactly that to the prison officials once we leave this room.&nbsp; Your son said he wanted to hate you, but his mommy said that it wasn&#8217;t your fault that you behave the way you do.&nbsp; You had a special woman and were too sick to take care of her or your children.&nbsp; To do what you did to your wife � well, the only thing I can say is that it was just wrong and to openly show preference for one child over the rest because he carry&#8217;s your name is just not thinking properly.&nbsp; I have absolutely no doubt that if you were to have a strong influence in your children&#8217;s lives, they would most likely wind up in front of many judges throughout their lives and to you Mrs. Lasko, I have to applaud you for having gone through what you did for six years and to still raise such a fine little man is amazing.&nbsp; It is for so many different reasons that I am granting your petition for divorce and until I have some statement from a psychiatrist who specifically deals with your illness Mr. Lasko, I am suspending all visitation of your children, which is too bad for you since I hear your ex-wife is about to have the fifth.�

The judge dropped the bomb and left as Tyler turned to stare at Skyler, completely surprised at the judges&#8217; decision and yet, in the back of his mind, he knew Skyler wasn&#8217;t doing any of it, especially after hearing what she had told their son.&nbsp; It had to be the cop and the lawyer, but it wasn&#8217;t Skyler, she obviously still loved him, even though she needed to be punished for being so easily swayed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

He was whispering to the guards when Skyler finally looked at him and she stood to face him as he hobbled over to her with a guard still on either side of him. 

Tyler smiled at Skyler, telling her he loved her before delivering a short, solid punch to the stomach.&nbsp; As Skyler dropped to the floor, Chelsea and Val ran to her while the guards began dragging Tyler out of the room.&nbsp; Skyler looked up in time to see the judge moving rapidly towards her as she was still trying to catch her breath. 

The judge stopped on his way to Skyler, whispering something to the bailiff before continuing on his way.

�Just like old times,� She said, trying to breathe.
�You&#8217;re definitely a fighter, aren&#8217;t you?�&nbsp; He asked as Linda, Val and Chelsea helped her stand.
�I guess we&#8217;ll see, I know he&#8217;s coming for me when he gets out and I know he&#8217;s not gonna be very happy with me after this.&nbsp; Tyler&#8217;s never, not been able to make things better before, so he&#8217;s bound to be very angry,� Skyler warned.
�Well, I guess I have a little more work to do then, don&#8217;t I?�&nbsp; He asked, touching her arm.&nbsp; �Are you taking her to the hospital Officer Gold?�&nbsp; 
�Yes sir.�&nbsp; 
�Let me know what happens, okay,� he instructed, winking at her.
�Yes your honor, I will.�&nbsp; 
�Thank you sir,� Skyler said, watching him leave. 
�Skyler?�&nbsp; Val asked.
�Yeah?�&nbsp; 
�Your ex-husband is really good looking, but man is he a prick,� Val said quietly.
�Tell me about it� I like that, ex-husband, I like that a lot,� Skyler smiled as they all walked out of the courtroom. 

Tyler hadn&#8217;t succeeded in his attempt to make Skyler miscarry and Chelsea called the judge as soon as they walked into the house.&nbsp; He did succeed in causing a delay to his own retrial though.&nbsp; His lawyer was less than pleased with his actions in the court room.&nbsp; 

With his world unraveling around him, Tyler began grasping at straws.&nbsp; He pled his case to his parents, who turned around to file for custody of the children.&nbsp; 

When Skyler received the papers, she called her lawyer immediately, explaining to her that they had never even seen the kids, ever.&nbsp; The lawyer encouraged her to stop worrying so much, but she couldn&#8217;t stop herself.&nbsp; 

As a small diversion, Chelsea decided it was time for all of the boys to get haircuts, claiming she was going to have to get them all beads, sandals and Hawaiian shirts soon.&nbsp; 

Skyler, still not very good with decisions, took along three baggies with each boy&#8217;s name on them, crying as she watched their beautiful long hair being chopped off.&nbsp; She cried again as she watched them sitting like perfect little gentlemen and again once they were finished, claiming they were growing up too fast.&nbsp; When all was said and done, she actually loved the haircuts so much that she had to take several pictures of each boy after returning to the house.

Frannie had a hard time believing how different the three of them looked with the shorter hair.&nbsp; As her eyes also began filling with tears, Chelsea decided to ignore them all, walking into the kitchen to grab a beer.&nbsp; 

Tyler was going through extensive therapy during this time and according to Chelsea he was looking for a new lawyer, or rather his parents were.&nbsp; 

At the time, their priority seemed to be focused at trying to take the children from Skyler.&nbsp; Even before their day in court, they hadn&#8217;t tried to see the kids or Skyler and in the courtroom they wouldn&#8217;t make eye contact with her at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The judge was the same as her divorce judge and even though she had no clue how things would turn out, she knew without a doubt that he would be fair about whatever decision he did make.&nbsp; 

Skyler was six months pregnant at the time of the hearing and the judge smiled, nodding at her as she stood next to her lawyer.&nbsp; 

After reading over the papers, he leaned back in his chair, taking a deep breath as he rubbed his temples.

�Mr. and Mrs. Lasko have you ever made any attempts to see your grandchildren either before or after your son went to prison?�&nbsp; The judge asked.
�No your honor, but��&nbsp; Mr. Lasko began.
�The children will stay with their mother and my advice to you and your son is to leave this woman alone, she&#8217;s gone through enough for one lifetime.&nbsp; Case dismissed,� he said, slamming down his gavel before leaving the courtroom.

Chelsea and Skyler were ecstatic, deciding to take the entire family out for dinner that night, settling on a fast-food restaurant, someplace with a play area, where the boys could let loose if they felt the urge.&nbsp; 

Skyler stared at Hunter as he and his brothers played, noticing how much he was beginning to look like Tyler.&nbsp; She smiled as she watched him take both of his brother&#8217;s hands over to the netted area to play, happy that he never had any nightmares after being face-to-face with his father.&nbsp; It was almost as though he had some closure after the meeting and now he could move on.&nbsp; 

As she watched the boys and tore up food for Anna, Skyler&#8217;s mind began to drift again.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
�I sure wish my mom and sister could see them someday.&nbsp; I wonder if my mother would return a picture if I mailed her one.�&nbsp; 
�Maybe you should try talking to your mom again now,� Chelsea suggested.
�I don&#8217;t think so, she said to stay away and she&#8217;s never said anything she didn&#8217;t mean.&nbsp; I just need to let it go.&nbsp; I am curious as to what Heather looks like now though.&nbsp; She just turned 17 last week and I bet she has lots of boyfriends.� 
�Couldn&#8217;t you just call and talk to your sister?�&nbsp; Chelsea asked.
�I tried once, but she told me the same thing mom did, she was always a lot closer to our mom.&nbsp; I was always closer to daddy,� Skyler explained.&nbsp; �Oh well, life goes on, if things were different, I wouldn&#8217;t have you and that would suck.� 
�That would most definitely suck,� Chelsea agreed.

Chapter 17

A further three months later, Tyler was still going to therapy and still having a difficult time approving of any of the lawyers his parents had hired for him.&nbsp; Skyler was quite pleased he was being so stubborn.&nbsp; 

She was especially happy after Chelsea told her she would be starting her vacation the following week and wanted the entire family to spend the day at Valley Fair.&nbsp; If possible, Skyler was more exited than the boys, since she had never been to a real fair before.&nbsp; 

The disappointed look that covered her face when Chelsea announced she had to go out of town on business for a couple of days was enough to break Chelsea&#8217;s heart in two.&nbsp; After promising they would go once she returned, Skyler&#8217;s face lit up again and even though she was displeased about Chelsea having to be away, Skyler smiled, wished her luck and kissed her goodbye. 

That very night, Chelsea called, but Skyler was afraid to answer the phone when she was home alone, so she always waited until she heard a familiar voice before picking it up, but Chelsea knew that.

�Hi baby, it&#8217;s just me� you there?�&nbsp; 
�Hi honey.&nbsp; You okay?�&nbsp; Skyler asked, grabbing the phone.
�I&#8217;m fine; I just missed you and wanted to hear your voice.�&nbsp; 
�That&#8217;s so sweet, I miss you too.&nbsp; Where are you?�&nbsp; 
�I told you.�&nbsp; 
�No you didn&#8217;t, you just said that you had to go away for work.� 
�How about if I tell you when I get home?�&nbsp; 
�Oh, Okay.&nbsp; Is your work stuff going okay?�&nbsp; 
�Actually, it&#8217;s going very well.�&nbsp; 
�D&#8217;you know when you&#8217;re coming home?�&nbsp; 
�Day after tomorrow, hopefully.�&nbsp; 
�I hope so.&nbsp; I pushed the crib into the bedroom and the boys are gonna sleep with me in our bed tonight.�&nbsp; 
�Why didn&#8217;t you tell me you were gonna do that before I left?&nbsp; You shouldn&#8217;t be pushing the crib around,� Chelsea scolded.
�I didn&#8217;t think about it until after you left, don&#8217;t be mad.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m not mad honey; I just don&#8217;t want you to hurt yourself.�&nbsp; 
�How about if I leave it there and you can move it back?�&nbsp; 
�Yes please.&nbsp; What&#8217;re the boys doing now?�&nbsp; 
�Hunter&#8217;s helping Tristan and Logan ride their scooters.�&nbsp; 
�He&#8217;s too grown up; I wish he&#8217;d play more.&nbsp; Maybe we should try and get him to have some fun after I get back.�&nbsp; 
�I think he thinks he needs to be the man of the house.�&nbsp; 
�Well he is, but he needs to have some fun too.�&nbsp; 
�We&#8217;ll work on it when you get home, I promise.�&nbsp; 
�I am gonna say goodbye now though so I can get something to eat.�&nbsp; 
�Us too.&nbsp; You gonna call again tomorrow?�&nbsp; 
�Probably, why, you got plans?�&nbsp; 
�Not a one, so I&#8217;ll be waiting,� Skyler assured her.
�Good.&nbsp; Tomorrow then?�&nbsp; 
�Tomorrow and I love you.�&nbsp; 
�I love you too and I think if you&#8217;re too worried about being alone, mom would love the company,� Chelsea suggested.
�I don&#8217;t know, maybe, she seems to like her space, but we&#8217;ll see,� Skyler said doubtfully.

As the women said their goodbyes, Skyler hung up the phone, immediately trying to get Hunter to play with his brothers instead of only helping them, but all he did was stare at her.&nbsp; She was just about to pull him aside for a serious discussion about playing when Anna began to cry, forcing her to drop it for the time being as she ran for her little girl. 

Anna was usually so happy after a nap, but naturally, that day she was being a little shit, was what Skyler was thinking as she took Anna into the living room to change her diaper before putting her in the highchair, but she just continued screaming even after the food was on her tray.&nbsp; The juice glass flew across the kitchen floor, cereal was going everywhere and when Skyler had been pushed to the limit it finally occurred to her what the problem was as she went for the teething gel.&nbsp; 

Once Skyler put some gel on her finger letting Anna bite on it, she was fine again.&nbsp; Skyler put some treats on the tray while she made sandwiches for the boys.&nbsp; 

After their food was ready she had to put Logan in his highchair, Tristan on his booster seat and Hunter crawled onto his own booster seat.&nbsp; She gave them their sandwiches before feeding Anna.

�You eating mommy?�&nbsp; Hunter asked.
�I will later sweetie.&nbsp; You worry too much.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m the man of the house now,� Hunter said, looking proud.
�Sweetie, you&#8217;ve always been the man of the house, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t play and have fun too.� 
�I have to be sponsible,� he said, smiling.
�Honey, you&#8217;re only five, you don&#8217;t have to be sponsible for everyone.�&nbsp; 
�But the judge said I needed to be.�&nbsp; 
�He did?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think he meant all the time sweetie.&nbsp; Just sometimes, like when it&#8217;s time to get ready for bed and eating, but other than that you should play with the toys too.&nbsp; You can play and still be the man of the house.�&nbsp; 

Hunter twisted his mouth, looking at her, as though he would take it all into consideration before he went back to eating his sandwich.&nbsp; 

Skyler was thinking she might like to snap the judge in the head as the doorbell rang.&nbsp; 

Putting more food on Anna&#8217;s tray, Skyler made her way to the door, looking through the peephole to see Frannie standing there.&nbsp; Skyler opened the door to see the older woman holding an overnight bag.

�Your daughter has a big mouth,� Skyler said with a smile.
�Well, if you won&#8217;t speak up when you need something, isn&#8217;t it nice to have someone around who will?�&nbsp; 
�She does take good care of me, so d&#8217;you and I love you both,� Skyler said, kissing Frannie on the cheek.
�We love you too dear, now where are my grandbabies?�&nbsp; 
�Having a late lunch, want some?�&nbsp; 
�I had lunch already, but I&#8217;ll bet you haven&#8217;t,� Frannie stated, making her way to the kitchen with Skyler following.

The next day Skyler had managed to get Hunter to actually play a little after Frannie had gone home, at least until Tristan asked him for help.&nbsp; Hunter let out a heavy sigh as he got off the floor.&nbsp; Skyler tried going instead, but he just looked at her as he began pushing his shoulders forward.

�Mommy, he needs a man,� Hunter stated before continuing on to Tristan.

Skyler thought he might be feeling too much pressure, but she had to smile anyway because it was so damned cute.&nbsp; 

She made sure to whisper as she recounted the story to Chelsea during their next phone conversation and once the women had finished giggling, Chelsea relayed that her trip had been very successful and she couldn&#8217;t wait to share it with Skyler the minute she got back, but all too soon it was time to say goodbye again.

Frannie walked over around lunch to make sure Skyler was eating.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t, but as soon as Frannie got there she did after being scolded for not taking better care of herself.&nbsp; She reminded Frannie that this was the best care she had ever taken with any of the kids and they had all turned out fine.&nbsp; After Frannie stared at her for a few minutes, Skyler admitted it was a habit she had gotten into when she was with Tyler and apparently it was a hard habit to break.&nbsp; 

Moving around the kitchen, Frannie made her something to eat and even though Skyler finished it all, she wound up throwing it up anyway.&nbsp; All she could do was shrug her shoulders while Frannie shook her head

After spending the night again, Frannie stayed with Skyler, making sure she ate more than toast and that she didn&#8217;t get too active with the kids.&nbsp; They were both playing with the kids when there was a knock at the door.&nbsp; 

Skyler struggled to get up, the boys trying to help her, but that only made it more difficult.&nbsp; She let them help her anyway; looking out the peep hole once she made it to the door.&nbsp; Outside she could see a young blonde girl staring straight ahead and an old familiar feeling crept in.&nbsp; She had no clue who the girl was, but she did notice something familiar about her.&nbsp; She turned around, looking back at Frannie.&nbsp; 

�I don&#8217;t know this person.&nbsp; What if it&#8217;s someone Tyler sent?�&nbsp; 
�What&#8217;s she look like dear?�&nbsp; 
�Blonde, young, pretty, she looks like I should know her, but I don&#8217;t know from where.�&nbsp; 

Frannie got up, walking over to look out the peephole, but she was smiling when she looked back at Skyler.

�Look again.�&nbsp; 

As Skyler looked out a second time, she saw Chelsea standing by the girl and her mother was there too.&nbsp; Unlocking the door, she swung it open, but she seemed to be frozen in place, only able to mutter, &#8216;oh my god&#8217;, as she stood staring out the door.&nbsp; 

Heather didn&#8217;t care; she began crying as she moved rapidly to Skyler, throwing her arms around her big sister, giving her one of the biggest hugs ever.&nbsp; Skyler was crying by then too as she held her arm out so her mother could get in on the hug as well.&nbsp; Skyler was almost sobbing by the time Hunter thought he should put a stop to these people holding back his mother and making her cry.&nbsp; He whispered to Tristan and Logan before the three of them were hitting the strangers on the legs, screaming for them to stop hurting their mommy.

While Skyler and Chelsea were trying to calm the boys, Anna had also begun screaming, even though Frannie was holding her and she continued pushing away from the older woman to get to her mother.&nbsp; 

Skyler was herding the boys into the house to make her way to Frannie, scooping Anna out of the woman&#8217;s arms, she quickly sat on the sofa with all the children huddling around her and sniffling.&nbsp; Sitting meant being quiet and they knew it.&nbsp; Skyler still knew it to be the only way to calm them all down, but whatever worked.

�I&#8217;m sorry, they just need to get to know you,� Skyler assured them.&nbsp; �I can&#8217;t believe you&#8217;re here!�&nbsp; 
�They always quiet down when you do that?�&nbsp; Asia asked.
�Yeah, Tyler didn&#8217;t like crying.�&nbsp; 
�Not out of them anyway,� Chelsea remarked.

Chelsea apologized after Skyler shot her a look.&nbsp; Skyler explained to the kids who the strangers were as she tried to remember if she had ever been as pretty as her little sister.&nbsp; 

The adults had just begun talking when Hunter pulled his mother&#8217;s arm so he could whisper into her ear.&nbsp; Skyler smiled as she kissed him on the head.

�Ask her.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m scawed mommy,� he whispered hoarsely.
�You don&#8217;t have to be sweetie, you know I won&#8217;t let anyone hurt you, ever,� she said as Hunter got a little smile on his face.
�Can you make cookies?�&nbsp; Hunter asked Asia.
�I make the best chocolate chip cookies,� Asia smiled.
�I remember,� Skyler added.
�Nana makes the best cookies,� Hunter stated, defiantly.
�Hunter, why&#8217;re you being mean?�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t know them,� he stated, crossing his arms.
�That&#8217;s no reason to be mean sweetie.&nbsp; That&#8217;s my mommy, just like I&#8217;m your mommy and that&#8217;s my sister, just like Anna is your sister.&nbsp; How would you feel if someone was being mean to us?�&nbsp; 
�Mad.�&nbsp; 
�Well you know I&#8217;d never get mad at you, but it hurts.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m sowwy mommy.&nbsp; I won&#8217;t nevew huwt you,� Hunter promised, giving her a hug.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m sowwy mommy&#8217;s mommy.�&nbsp; 
�That&#8217;s okay sweetheart,� Asia said, tearing up.

Hunter whispered to his mother again and Skyler smiled as Chelsea and Frannie brought in coffee and iced tea.

�I think your grandma and Auntie Heather would like that a whole bunch,� Skyler said.&nbsp; �Hunter would like to give you both a hug.�&nbsp; 

Like the little man he was, Hunter stood up, walking over to hug his aunt first and then his Grandma Asia.&nbsp; Once he hugged Asia, he sat next to her, letting her hug him as he smiled at his mother who was returning the smile.&nbsp; After Hunter took the first step, Tristan and Logan followed with Tristan sitting on the other side of Asia and Logan winding up beside Heather.&nbsp; Skyler wiped the tears from her eyes, but she never stopped smiling.

�I can&#8217;t believe you&#8217;re a mother,� Heather said.
�I can&#8217;t believe you grew up,� Skyler returned.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t understand what happened so that you&#8217;re here.&nbsp; I mean the last time I talked to both of you; things didn&#8217;t really go so well.�&nbsp; 
�Well, for right now, let&#8217;s just say that Chelsea made us see the error of our ways.&nbsp; I owe you an apology Sky,� Asia insisted.
�No you don&#8217;t mom, you either Heather.&nbsp; It just was what it was and I don&#8217;t think anything could&#8217;ve happened any differently than it did or you probably wouldn&#8217;t be here even now,� Skyler said with a faraway look on her face.&nbsp; �Boys, I bet there are a few cookies in the kitchen with your names on them,� she added as they all ran out to the kitchen, Frannie moving quickly behind them.
�So Tyler really did do all these things, including Frisbee?�&nbsp; Asia asked.
�When I changed my story about Frisbee being in my room all night, was right after Tyler jabbed me in the back with his finger.�&nbsp; 
�I am so sorry that we ever doubted you my baby girl.�&nbsp; 
�It doesn&#8217;t matter anymore, you&#8217;re here now.&nbsp; Did you leave a ton of boyfriends behind Heather?�&nbsp; Skyler asked, wanting to change the subject.
�No, not really,� Heather replied.
�One special guy?�&nbsp; 
�Nope.�&nbsp; 
�Don&#8217;t tell me you&#8217;re gay too?�&nbsp; 
�You kidding?&nbsp; Mom would have a coronary!�&nbsp; Heather laughed.

The boys all returned to their spots next to Asia and Heather, snuggling in close as they nibbled on their cookies.

�I would not!&nbsp; You girls are being mean,� Asia commented, looking at Heather.
�My mommy&#8217;s nevew mean, she tects us.&nbsp; Daddy&#8217;s mean,� Hunter mumbled, looking at his hands.
�I&#8217;m sorry Hunter, you&#8217;re right, your mommy&#8217;s not mean, I was just teasing her,� Asia tried explaining.
�Daddy teased mommy.&nbsp; He sayed he&#8217;d be nice if she did things, then he wasn&#8217;t.�&nbsp; 
�Hunter, sweetie, I think we should have a little talk, would that be okay?�&nbsp; 
�You mad mommy?�&nbsp; 
�Never baby,� Skyler assured him, handing Anna over to Chelsea.

Skyler reached her hand out to Hunter, reassuring him that everything would be fine before they disappeared into the boy&#8217;s room.&nbsp; 

Once Skyler and Hunter had vanished around the corner; Chelsea nodded towards the boys, a sign for Frannie to take the boys and Anna for more cookies and milk.&nbsp; The boys followed Frannie into the kitchen, leaving Chelsea with Asia and Heather.&nbsp; The boys never said no to cookies and at times it was the only way to keep them from listening to things they shouldn&#8217;t hear.&nbsp; 

�Am I right in assuming you didn&#8217;t tell us the whole story?�&nbsp; Heather asked.
�The first time I met Sky was when Hunter was screaming and some neighbors called the station.&nbsp; When we got to the house, Tyler told us that she was� well, amorous, but she had a hand mark on her face and bruises on her throat and obviously she was scared to death of him.&nbsp; She looked at me once, but that was only to tell me to stay away and leave them alone.&nbsp; The second time I saw her was in the hospital after she just had Tristan and Tyler had just finished telling her why he beat her when Hunter was born, she was shaking so badly she couldn&#8217;t even feed Tristan his bottle when I walked in.&nbsp; By the third time I met her, Sky was huddled against a wall and her face was so battered that I barely recognized her.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t care that she could barely move once she heard Tristan and Hunter crying for her.&nbsp; As I was helping her in to them, I thought she might wanna clean up before she went to their room, but she told me they had seen her like that thousands of times before and all that mattered was that they needed her.&nbsp; By that time she had already lost two babies because of beatings.&nbsp; She had a chance to leave him later and he claimed he was willing to let her go, but he wouldn&#8217;t let the boys go too, so she lied and told him she loved him and stayed.&nbsp; We had bugged the house then and during that time, this might be hard, but you should know that Tyler hurt her almost every single time they had sex.&nbsp; He never hit her or anything in front of Logan, but he didn&#8217;t hesitate to do it in front of Hunter and Tristan.&nbsp; Sky always told them that no matter what their daddy did to her, they should go straight to their room, because she would be okay, so they didn&#8217;t see everything, but they listened to him say that if she did one thing, he wouldn&#8217;t do another just before he would turn around and do it anyway.&nbsp; She keeps telling Hunter he should forget all those things, but naturally he&#8217;s not,� Chelsea explained.
�Oh my god, my poor girl, I had no idea it would be that bad.&nbsp; Those poor babies.�&nbsp; 
�Why just Logan?�&nbsp; Heather asked.
�Because of his name, Tyler Logan.�&nbsp; 
�Poor Sky.&nbsp; She is amazing though and strong,� Heather commented.
�Don&#8217;t say poor Sky, she doesn&#8217;t feel that way.&nbsp; She&#8217;s probably the most amazing person I&#8217;ve ever met and she&#8217;d sacrifice herself for anyone she loves.&nbsp; She did it around nine months ago when Tyler sent her a letter saying he wanted to kill me and my mother because she hadn&#8217;t gone to spend the night with him, so she did, even though we all begged her not to.&nbsp; I made all of the arrangements before she went inside to have the guards photograph her neck, since he basically ordered her to wear a turtleneck.&nbsp; She was so upset by that when he wrote her that she got physically ill.&nbsp; When she came out the next day, he had hurt her so badly that she could barely walk.&nbsp; He had broken two ribs, her neck was purple and she had bruises in places I can&#8217;t even discuss, but even with the pain, once she was on the sofa, the kids crawled onto her and they just clung to her.&nbsp; Seeing how the boys were once she got home gave her the strength to start divorce proceedings and it threw Tyler off his path.&nbsp; People were finally beginning to see him for what he really is,� Chelsea continued explaining.
�Well, that&#8217;s a good thing though, isn&#8217;t it?�&nbsp; Heather asked.
�Unfortunately he&#8217;s getting back on track again,� Chelsea stated.

Skyler closed the door behind her as Hunter walked over to sit on his bed before she followed him and slid back.&nbsp; Hunter moved back until his mother was holding him close.

�You have an amazing memory, you know that?�&nbsp; 
�I know.�&nbsp; 
�I think you&#8217;re a very smart little boy, did you know that?�&nbsp; 
�I know.�&nbsp; 
�What I wanna ask you is, do you get upset when you can&#8217;t talk about these things, the things you remember about daddy?�&nbsp; 
�I dunno,� Hunter said, shrugging.
�D&#8217;you ever have bad dreams?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t hear you at night, but I know sometimes you&#8217;re in bed with Tristan and other times Tristan&#8217;s in bed with you.&nbsp; Is that because you both get scared?�&nbsp; 
�Sometimes I have bad dweams, but I can&#8217;t be loud, amember?&nbsp; Twistan has dweams too.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t have bad dweams when we sleep with you mommy,� Hunter admitted.
�I&#8217;m sorry Hunter.&nbsp; Does it upset you not to talk about it?�&nbsp; 
�Sometimes I get sowe hew,� Hunter said, pointing at his stomach.
�Does Tristan too?�&nbsp; 
�Sometimes he cwies,� Hunter said, snuggling closer.
�Does Logan remember?�&nbsp; 
�He heaws you scweam sometimes.�&nbsp; 
�Mommy and Mommy C are gonna do whatever it takes to make you feel better and not have bad dreams anymore, you and your brothers, okay?�&nbsp; Skyler assured him.
�That&#8217;d make us happy mommy.�&nbsp; 
�Maybe you should go see if nana has any more cookies for right now.�&nbsp; 

Hunter gave his mother a hug as she kissed him on the head before he ran out of the room.&nbsp; Skyler stayed on the bed with her head back and eyes closed, even as Chelsea walked in.&nbsp; Shutting the door behind her, Chelsea moved onto the bed, sitting beside Skyler.&nbsp; Skyler turned her head sideways, opening her eyes to smile sadly at Chelsea.

�I missed you.�&nbsp; 
�I missed you too,� Chelsea said.&nbsp; �Is Hunter okay?�&nbsp; 
�No, he&#8217;s really not and neither are Tristan or Logan.�&nbsp; 
�What&#8217;s going on babe?�&nbsp; 
�They&#8217;ve been having nightmares all along, but Hunter and Tristan go to each other.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why they&#8217;re in the same bed some mornings.&nbsp; Hunter said that Tristan cries, he just does it quietly, they both do.&nbsp; Logan remembers hearing me scream and cry.&nbsp; Hunter said the only time they don&#8217;t have nightmares is when they sleep with me.&nbsp; I feel so guilty about all of this; about them and what I&#8217;ve done to &#8216;em,� Skyler said, her voice shaking.
�You haven&#8217;t done anything to them; you&#8217;ve done it for them.&nbsp; You can&#8217;t take this on yourself and this isn&#8217;t your fault� I have an idea, we&#8217;ll let the boys sleep with us and after you have the baby, we&#8217;ll find someone for them to talk to, hell we&#8217;ll all go,� Chelsea said, taking Skyler&#8217;s hand in hers.
�You&#8217;re amazing.&nbsp; It had to be fate that brought us together,� Skyler said, kissing Chelsea&#8217;s hand.
�Here I just thought it was my police charm.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;d have to say that was probably part of it,� Skyler laughed.
�I saw some pictures of you when you were younger.�&nbsp; 
�Oh my god, I bet I looked like a dork.�&nbsp; 
�I thought you were almost as beautiful as you are now.�&nbsp; 
�You do make me happy.�&nbsp; 
�You ready to go back to the living room?�&nbsp; 
�Yeah, I&#8217;m ready.�&nbsp; 

Skyler listened as Heather talked about school and the fact that she was actually quite similar to the way Skyler had been.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t have a tight circle of friends; she had a large group and some boyfriends, but not anyone special.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t very hard to break away since there wasn&#8217;t anyone she hung on the phone with all night long and she liked it that way.&nbsp; 

Asia had been working at the same part-time job, sewing, for many years and since she was able to pay off the house after her Fred passed away, she was doing fairly well without having to pay a mortgage anymore.&nbsp; It didn&#8217;t make her miss him any less, but she got by.

They talked for hours until Skyler got off the sofa, grabbing Chelsea by the hand and dragging her into the kitchen.&nbsp; Once they were alone, Skyler gave Chelsea the biggest kiss she had ever given her.

�I didn&#8217;t thank you earlier.&nbsp; Was this the business that you had to tend to?�&nbsp; 
�I actually went because of Tyler&#8217;s sister.&nbsp; They finished the autopsy and there were definite fibers in her nasal passages, but she died at the time when it &#8216;was&#8217; suggested that you put your baby on their stomach to sleep.&nbsp; There&#8217;s just not enough evidence to say that he actually did it, but the suspicion is there now and when that didn&#8217;t work out, well, they&#8217;re working on the parents of the other kids, so they can do more thorough autopsies on them.� 
�So you think he&#8217;s gonna get out soon?�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m sorry; I think he&#8217;ll probably be out in the next couple of weeks.&nbsp; He claims he&#8217;s a changed man.�&nbsp; 
�They aren&#8217;t gonna let him see the kids� are they?�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t know sweetie, but if they do, I would think it would be supervised,� she said, holding Skyler.
�We&#8217;re not gonna be safe.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;ve got some people hired and standing by.&nbsp; They&#8217;ll be all over inside and out of the house.�&nbsp; 
�You can&#8217;t go to work if he gets out.�&nbsp; 
�Let&#8217;s just wait and see what happens.&nbsp; Right now you should just visit.�&nbsp; 
�I just hope he doesn&#8217;t get hold of me until after this baby&#8217;s born,� Skyler mumbled, leaving Chelsea behind, scratching her head.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Back in the living room, Hunter was talking like a crazy person; even Frannie had begun looking at him strangely.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Tristan was going on too, but he was harder to understand.&nbsp; 

Logan was just snuggling into his aunt while she continued hugging him.&nbsp; 

Skyler sat down again, pushing her sleeves up.

�What happened to your arm?�&nbsp; Heather asked.&nbsp; �It looks a little crooked.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;ll tell you later,� Skyler promised, rubbing it before pulling her sleeves down again. 
�Daddy bwaked it,� Hunter spoke up as Skyler stared at him.
�How d&#8217;you remember that?�&nbsp; 
�I was there,� he reminded her.
�I know, but you were just a baby.�&nbsp; 
�I amember.�&nbsp; 
�You remember so much sweetie, but we&#8217;ll talk about all that later, okay?�&nbsp; 
�Okay mommy.�&nbsp; 
�Thank you baby.�&nbsp; 

After catching up and talking all through dinner, Frannie began preparing to go home, but Chelsea wouldn&#8217;t let her.&nbsp; She explained that right then she would feel more relaxed if they all stayed together.&nbsp; Frannie explained that she didn&#8217;t have any clean pajamas at the house, so Chelsea and Heather walked over to get her a few changes of clothing.&nbsp; 

The rest of them were sitting in the living room drinking coffee when Asia wanted Skyler to tell them about her arm.&nbsp; She suggested they wait until Heather and Chelsea return since neither of them knew the story either.

�You have some wonderful children Sky,� Asia commented.
�Thank you mom, I think they&#8217;re pretty special.�&nbsp; 
�And there&#8217;re so many of them!�&nbsp; 
�I know, I told Chelsea I&#8217;m afraid to even drive down the same street as a sperm bank,� she joked.

Once Chelsea and Heather returned Skyler and Chelsea put the boys in their bed, telling them they would be in shortly while Anna was put into her crib, which was still in their bedroom.&nbsp; 

They changed the sheets on the boy&#8217;s beds for Asia and Heather before going back into the living room.&nbsp; 

Skyler knew her mother had mentioned her arm as soon as Heather began pushing Skyler to tell her about it.&nbsp; Skyler looked at her sister with a big grin.

�What?�&nbsp; Heather asked.
�You&#8217;re still pushy.�&nbsp; 
�And you still make excuses for everyone.�&nbsp; 
�True, I guess I&#8217;d rather be pushy.�&nbsp; 
�Now stop trying to change the subject and tell us what happened to your arm,� Heather insisted.
�I know I&#8217;d like to know,� Chelsea admitted.&nbsp; �I was always afraid to ask.�&nbsp; 
�Well, the whole story starts like a week or so before.&nbsp; That was the first time you came to the house and made me go outside with you and I think he got mad at me for doing that.&nbsp; That was when he disappeared for a couple of days and suddenly we had a subscription to the hometown paper, but he wouldn&#8217;t let me read the first one no matter what I did.&nbsp; The second week he let me read it and that was when I saw daddy&#8217;s obituary.&nbsp; I lost control and was asking him why and then I got mad and shouted at him.&nbsp; I forgot Hunter was eating cereal in his chair and I told Tyler to just kill me already.&nbsp; I was sick of him treating me the way he did and god he hit me hard, so hard that he knocked me clear across the kitchen where I hit my arm on the counter and broke it.&nbsp; Hunter brought me back to reality when he started crying, so Tyler put cardboard around it and duct tape and I thanked him and then I took care of Hunter,� Skyler explained, shrugging.
�Oh my god, that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s crooked and that&#8217;s why you rub it!&nbsp; It still hurts you, doesn&#8217;t it?�&nbsp; Chelsea asked.
�Mostly it just aches and that&#8217;s only off-and-on, usually I don&#8217;t even notice it anymore.�&nbsp; 
�We need to have that looked at.�&nbsp; 
�No we don&#8217;t, I need to hold my babies,� Skyler said.&nbsp; �You must be tired, this whole couple of days has to be overwhelming I would imagine,� she added, looking at her mother.
�A little,� Asia admitted.

Skyler got up, taking her mother and sister by the hands to show them into the boy&#8217;s room.&nbsp; Asia moved towards her daughter, giving Skyler a hug.

�I&#8217;m so sorry about what I said to you when you called.�&nbsp; 
�I know mom.&nbsp; It&#8217;s okay, I understand.�&nbsp; 
�You always understand, you need to learn how to get angry,� Asia said.
�I got angry once and my arm got bwaked, as Hunter would say.� 
�I wish you wouldn&#8217;t have been so nice to Tyler in the first place,� Asia commented.
�He fooled everyone mom and he&#8217;s doing it again.&nbsp; I think I kinda threw him off when I actually went through with the divorce and he missed a few steps, but from what Chelsea said, it sounds like he&#8217;s back on track again.&nbsp; I know he&#8217;ll come for me and if you&#8217;re both here when he does, I want you to grab the kids and run.&nbsp; He&#8217;s too obsessed with me to kill me yet, so I think I&#8217;ll be okay, but the only one of the kids he wants is Logan and he wants us both.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t care if he gets me, but I don&#8217;t want him anywhere near the kids, okay,� Skyler wanted to make sure both Asia and Heather understood.&nbsp; 
 �Why would you name any of the boys after him?�&nbsp; Heather asked.
�Because I got beat for not naming Hunter after him.&nbsp; I avoided the beating with Tristan by telling him that Chelsea came to see me in the hospital.�&nbsp; 
�It&#8217;s too bad the babies had to see all that,� Asia remarked.
�Oh mom, I wish that was the only thing I had to worry about them seeing.&nbsp; I figure they might need some therapy.�&nbsp; 
�What about you honey?�&nbsp; 
�Chelsea&#8217;s been a big help, I tell her a lot of stuff and then there&#8217;s Val.&nbsp; She&#8217;s the wife of Chelsea&#8217;s partner, Matt.�&nbsp; 
�But not all of it?�&nbsp; Asia asked.
�No, tonight was the first she heard about the broken arm.&nbsp; Some stuff, I don&#8217;t even wanna remember, but she wants us to all go to therapy together, so I guess we&#8217;ll see,� Skyler said.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m gonna let you get some sleep now.�&nbsp; 

Hugging them both, Skyler held on for as long as she could before going back into the living room.&nbsp; She had been having back pain a little earlier in the day and it was acting up again.&nbsp; All she wanted to do was lie down because the entire day had been emotional and she was feeling it.

�You ready to go to bed?�&nbsp; 
�Way past ready, g&#8217;night Frannie.�&nbsp; 
�Night mom.�&nbsp; 
�Night girls, get a good night&#8217;s sleep.�&nbsp; 

Chelsea and Skyler left Frannie to take care of the doors and alarm before going to sleep in the guest room.&nbsp; 

As Chelsea and Skyler entered the bedroom, they both smiled when they saw little boys turned every-which-way in the bed and after changing into some pajamas, Chelsea straightened them all out to make room for her and Skyler.&nbsp; Not a single boy woke up during any of it.

Chapter 18

Skyler noticed it was only three in the morning, but she was having horrible pains right at that moment.&nbsp; She was half-way around the bed so she could wake up Chelsea when she felt her water break.&nbsp; 

�Shit!�&nbsp; Skyler whispered.
�Wha� what� what&#8217;s wrong?�&nbsp; Chelsea asked, running to the foot of the bed, stepping in a puddle of yuck as she reached Skyler.&nbsp; �Shit!�&nbsp; She rasped as she began leading Skyler out of the bedroom.&nbsp; �Baby!�&nbsp; Chelsea shouted as they got into the hallway.
�Sshh,� Skyler hissed, putting her hand against the wall to breathe as Chelsea ran to wake up Frannie.
�Calm down,� Frannie instructed as she led Chelsea back out to the hallway.
�Yes, please,� Skyler agreed.&nbsp; 

Chelsea was up and running again, not even knocking on the bedroom door where Asia and Heather were sleeping.&nbsp; She ran in, making Skyler laugh as Chelsea&#8217;s voice continued getting higher.&nbsp; 

Heather walked rapidly out of the bedroom, asking Skyler what she needed her to do before quietly helping her into the bathroom so she could change into some clothes.&nbsp; Skyler smiled at Heather.

�She gets a little excited,� Skyler confessed.
�Ya think?&nbsp; Mom&#8217;s trying to calm her down, I think she was making her put her head between her knees when I left,� Heather explained as she and Skyler laughed.
�She&#8217;s awesome once we get to the hospital, but at the house she just falls apart.&nbsp; You wouldn&#8217;t think so, being a cop and all.�&nbsp; 
�She was a nervous wreck when she came to the house.�&nbsp; 
�She wanted so much to make me happy I guess.&nbsp; I&#8217;d to go into such a daze at times, wondering about you and how many boyfriends you had or if you were happy and what mom would be doing at certain times of the day.&nbsp; You grew up so nice.�&nbsp; 

By the time they walked out of the bathroom, everyone but Frannie was dressed and Chelsea was completely in charge of the situation.&nbsp; Not a single woman could believe the children hadn&#8217;t been awakened by Chelsea&#8217;s shouting.&nbsp; 


Heather and Asia went along to the hospital, where they were able to watch Trinity Ellen as she arrived in the world.&nbsp; Skyler couldn&#8217;t have been happier about having a second little girl around the house.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

The following morning, after visiting hours had begun, Matt and Val were already at the hospital, waiting to meet the newest arrival.&nbsp; It was then that Chelsea informed them that they were all going to be under house arrest very soon.&nbsp; Skyler wasn&#8217;t very happy about the timing of the news, but she understood the need.&nbsp; 

Frannie showed up later in the day with Anna and the boys so they could meet their new sister.&nbsp; Hunter was perfectly protective, not taking his eyes off Trinity the entire time he was there.&nbsp; Skyler actually hated how grown up he seemed at his age.&nbsp; By then, he was six going on 60 and she just hoped some counseling would eventually help him to be a little boy.

Three days later, Skyler was going home and her sister was thanking her for turning her off to ever having a baby.&nbsp; Skyler laughed as she told her it was worse to watch than going through it.

�Actually, I was impressed with how quiet you were,� Asia commented.
�She was trained well,� Chelsea commented as Skyler shot her a look.
�Hunter was the hardest I think, but mostly because I had no idea what to expect and I was alone and scared to death at 17.�&nbsp; 
�So where was Tyler?�&nbsp; Asia asked as Skyler shrugged.
�He&#8217;d come in right after they were born and then he&#8217;d leave until it was time for us to go home,� Skyler explained.&nbsp; �It was hard when Logan was born since I had two cribs in my room and had to keep all three boys happy, but Hunter was always so good.�&nbsp; 
�My guess is that even as a baby, he was still the man of the house,� Heather commented, making them all laughed.

Chapter 19

The week before Thanksgiving, Tyler was released and bodyguards were brought in.&nbsp; Both Chelsea and Matt took a leave of absence during that time, so Chelsea hired a private detective to give her Tyler&#8217;s whereabouts daily.&nbsp; 

Tyler twirled the ring on his wedding finger as he walked out of the prison gate and into his mother&#8217;s arms.&nbsp; He patted her on the back before smiling at his father.&nbsp; Tyler Sr. opened the back door as Katherine crawled inside and Tyler walked around to the front seat.&nbsp; As they began to travel, Tyler stared out the window.

�What&#8217;re your plans son?�&nbsp; 
�What d&#8217;you think his plans are?!&nbsp; Our baby&#8217;s coming home to stay where he knows he&#8217;s loved naturally,� Katherine smiled.
�I&#8217;m not your baby and I&#8217;m just going to your house long enough to get my bearings before I get my wife back.� 
�She divorced you!&nbsp; She&#8217;s not your wife anymore!�&nbsp; Katherine shouted.
�Shut up!�&nbsp; Tyler shouted.
�Katherine, please don&#8217;t speak until someone asks for your input,� Tyler Sr., instructed as Katherine stared out the side window, letting the tears fall.
�I figure that if I can get her alone somewhere, without any interruptions, we&#8217;ll figure it out and she&#8217;ll see things my way.&nbsp; I know she still loves me and what she did was only because those people around her forced her to go through with divorcing me.� 
�Well, if you need me to son, I can set up something out in the woods for you.&nbsp; If you want me to that is?�&nbsp; 
�That&#8217;d be great dad.&nbsp; How long would it take?�&nbsp; 
�Maybe a week or two.&nbsp; You&#8217;d have to keep a low profile for a while, I mean if you take her.�&nbsp; 
�Will I need to get the groceries?�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;ll take care of everything.�&nbsp; 
�Perfect,� Tyler said with a grin.

Tyler thought he should definitely check in with Asia and Heather, just to make sure they hadn&#8217;t heard from Skyler, even better if they had, but as he looked around while he stood at the door, he realized nobody had been there in a while.&nbsp; Giving the door a kick, he called Skyler a &#8216;bitch&#8217; and in that moment he knew he wasn&#8217;t going to get close to Skyler unless he planned everything very carefully.&nbsp; 

After discussing the entire situation with his father for three days, he snuck out the back door one night, going to a spot where his father had parked a car he had sneakily bought and Tyler drove back to the cities.&nbsp; 

Skyler knew he was going after anyone who had been nice to her and Chelsea relayed that message to the judge.&nbsp; She knew he hadn&#8217;t taken the warning very seriously when she saw the news report that the judge and his wife had both been in a fatal car crash.&nbsp; Skyler knew it wasn&#8217;t an accident as she folded the paper back up and put her head into her hands as she began to cry.

�I should&#8217;ve just gone to him when he got out.�&nbsp; 
�Why?&nbsp; Why would you do that when you have all these babies?�&nbsp; Heather asked in total disbelief.
�It would be because of my babies I would do it Heather, the same reason I stayed with him all those years ago when he threatened to get you into a car with him and do god knows what to you,� Skyler informed a shocked looking Heather.
�But you can&#8217;t continue doing that honey.&nbsp; You can&#8217;t save everyone by sacrificing yourself, don&#8217;t you see that yet?�&nbsp; Chelsea asked.
�Damned if I do, damned if I don&#8217;t, probably be better if I just wasn&#8217;t here,� Skyler said, standing up.
�What&#8217;s that suppose to mean?�&nbsp; Chelsea asked.
�It means that if I was dead, he wouldn&#8217;t have anything to obsess about,� Skyler said as she was suddenly being spun around to face Chelsea.
�Please don&#8217;t give up now, please?�&nbsp; Chelsea cried, holding her against the wall.
�I&#8217;m not giving up, I swear, but I think I&#8217;m gonna need a lot of therapy by the time this is over,� Skyler stated as Chelsea held her even tighter.
�I&#8217;ll make sure we all have the best therapist there is when this is all over, as long as you promise to never give up.&nbsp; I know you&#8217;d never break a promise to me,� Chelsea pushed.
�I promise you that I won&#8217;t give up, but I&#8217;m never gonna believe that my being alive isn&#8217;t causing more trouble than I&#8217;m worth.&nbsp; So many people would still be alive if I would&#8217;ve just killed myself the first time I thought about it,� Skyler explained, rubbing Chelsea&#8217;s cheek before walking into the living room to spend time with the kids.

By Thanksgiving morning, Skyler was going crazy with feelings of guilt.&nbsp; The rest of the women in the house tried comforting her by explaining she could do no more than warn people, but it hadn&#8217;t made her feel any better.&nbsp; 

The kids were feeling Skyler&#8217;s stress and it was becoming painfully obvious as they stopped playing completely, so taking a deep breath she decided to have a moment with them all.&nbsp; Anna was the first to crawl on her as she sat against pillows on the floor, next was Hunter, Tristan and finally Logan.&nbsp; She sat there as they all fell asleep on her.&nbsp; 

Chelsea and Heather were walking into the living room and stopped, both of them backing into the kitchen again so Skyler and the kids could have their quiet time.

 

At the top of Tyler&#8217;s list was the judge who had the nerve to let Skyler divorce him.&nbsp; He watched the judge&#8217;s moves for a week straight before loosening a bolt on the engine.&nbsp; Tyler didn&#8217;t need to watch after that, he knew it would happen eventually and the judge would never be able to look down on him again.&nbsp; 

His next stop was the hospital to take care of the people who had originally taken Skyler away from him; he&#8217;d get everyone directly around Skyler in time.

Tyler felt as though things were on his side the moment he saw one of the four ambulance workers walking out of the hospital and getting into her car.&nbsp; He followed her through the city, feeling as though he were back on his game again.&nbsp; Following the heavy set girl into an apartment complex parking lot, Tyler managed to get to the front entrance before her.&nbsp; As Tyler pretended he was looking for his keys, the girl in her mid-20&#8217;s smiled at Tyler as she unlocked the door.

�Awesome, I forgot my keys somewhere,� Tyler claimed.
�I don&#8217;t recall seeing you here before,� She remarked, still smiling.
�Yeah, I just moved in� damn, I bet I left those keys in the apartment too, crap.&nbsp; I guess I better go find a phone so I can call my roommate, hopefully he&#8217;s not as stupid as I am,� Tyler laughed.
�You could come up and use my phone, if you&#8217;d like.&nbsp; My roommates shouldn&#8217;t be around to bug you for a little while yet,� she laughed.&nbsp; 
�Cool, thanks,� Tyler smiled as he followed her to her apartment.

As Tyler walked into the apartment, the woman pointed out the phone to him.&nbsp; Tyler picked it up and as she walked past, he wrapped the cord around her neck.&nbsp; He knew he was suppose to since he hadn&#8217;t seen a phone with a cord in years.&nbsp; She began to struggle, but she was no match for Tyler.

�You shouldn&#8217;t&#8217;ve pulled my wife outta that car that day you cunt,� Tyler growled into her ear as he heard her neck snap.

Tyler grabbed towels from the kitchen, wiping his fingerprints off everything he had touched.&nbsp; As he went back into the kitchen, he looked under the sink, finding a can of lye and after spraying her body with water, he dumped the drain cleaner on her, smiling as he watched her skin begin to bubble.&nbsp; After letting himself out of the apartment, he dropped the towels into an outside garbage dumpster.

Driving back to the hospital, Tyler was hoping his luck would still hold out and he would see the others enter or leave.&nbsp; He wound up sitting outside the hospital for a day and a half before seeing one of the three men who had touched Skyler.&nbsp; He followed the man to the bus stop before following the bus partially through the city.&nbsp; Slowly cruising at a distance, Tyler followed the man as he walked from the bus stop to a house that looked worse than the very first apartment building he and Skyler had lived in.&nbsp; 

Tyler watched the man go into the house, but he was only inside for a short time before he walked back out with a woman and two small boys.&nbsp; Ducked low in the driver&#8217;s seat, he stayed put as the man drove off with his family in tow.&nbsp; Carefully, Tyler left the safety of his vehicle to let himself into the house, grabbing a butcher knife out of the drawer before letting himself out of the house again.&nbsp; 

The man and his family returned home after a short time, but he didn&#8217;t go into the house with them and his wife began shouting at him before he drove off alone.&nbsp; 

Tyler debated following him, but then decided to stay put, reaching for his gloves off the seat, making sure to clean his fingerprints off the knife.&nbsp; Much later, the man returned home and Tyler was waiting.&nbsp; He felt it was to his advantage as he hid behind a tree and watched the man stagger towards the house.&nbsp; As the man pulled out his keys, Tyler moved quickly and quietly, sticking the knife into his back several times, leaving it there the last time.&nbsp; 

The ground was crispy, but it hadn&#8217;t snowed yet, so after making sure he left no boot prints around, he walked back to the car before driving away.

After watching the hospital for three more days, Tyler realized he needed to move on.&nbsp; He wanted Skyler with him before Thanksgiving so they would both have something to be thankful about.&nbsp; 

He knew where Chelsea and her mother both lived and after pulling a hat down low on his head, he drove past both houses.&nbsp; Chelsea&#8217;s house was guarded to the teeth, but Frannie&#8217;s house was completely empty.&nbsp; Tyler decided he could bide his time there until someone got brave and ventured over.&nbsp; 

Parking his car several blocks away, Tyler returned to Frannie&#8217;s house, letting himself inside through a garage window.&nbsp; He spent most of his time walking around the house, looking at photo albums and smoking.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t care where he dropped his ashes or his cigarettes and the majority of the butts were put out on Chelsea&#8217;s face in the photographs around the house.

Skyler opened her eyes to the site of Chelsea putting on her jacket.&nbsp; She whistled to the strawberry-blonde, giving her a head nod as she began moving children off her lap.

�Where d&#8217;you think you&#8217;re going?�&nbsp; Skyler asked quietly.
�We forgot a few things, but mom has them at her house.�&nbsp; 
�Take your jacket off, I&#8217;ll get them.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;ll take a guard with me.�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t want you leaving the house, if he gets hold of you, you&#8217;re dead and I&#8217;m not living with that too.&nbsp; If you can take a guard and be safe, then it&#8217;ll be just as safe for me.�&nbsp; 
�You&#8217;re not leaving the house.�&nbsp; 
�And neither are any of you.&nbsp; He doesn&#8217;t wanna kill me, but he wants the rest of you dead.&nbsp; You made me a promise and you&#8217;re not gonna break it,� Skyler said forcefully.
�We&#8217;re probably being overdramatic.� 
�Just stop Chels,� Skyler demanded.&nbsp; �Either let me go, or leave it there.�&nbsp; 
�Fine, but I&#8217;ll pick your bodyguard.�&nbsp; 
�Fine,� Skyler said, putting on her jacket and boots.

As Skyler and Deke began to walk, she could feel that something wasn&#8217;t right and the hairs on her neck began to stand up.&nbsp; Nervously she began looking around as Deke scanned their surroundings as well.&nbsp; 

�Seems like a lot to go through for cranberry sauce and yams,� Skyler laughed nervously.
�I think it&#8217;ll be okay,� Deke stated, putting a hand on her arm for reassurance.

As they reached Frannie&#8217;s house, Skyler looked around one last time before putting the key into the lock.&nbsp; When she opened the door, she could smell the hint of stale cigarette smoke and rapidly pulled it shut again.&nbsp; 

Skyler was about to tell Deke they needed someone to search the house when she heard a thud, turning in time to see Deke lying unconscious on the ground.&nbsp; Seconds later her own head was smashed against the door and as she slid down into unconsciousness, she looked directly into Tyler&#8217;s eyes.&nbsp; 

Watching to make sure Skyler was completely out; Tyler turned his attention to the man who had his hand on his wife&#8217;s shoulder only moments before.&nbsp; He wanted to kill him, but Tyler knew he would be blamed if the man died, so instead he moved the man&#8217;s hands off to the side, stomping on them several times, satisfied that he wouldn&#8217;t be touching anyone for a while.&nbsp; 

With his ultimate goal taken care of, Tyler picked Skyler off the landing, carrying her to his car.&nbsp; It had all been so easy, confirming his belief that Skyler was truly supposed to belong to him.

Chelsea knew Skyler had been gone far too long and was already kicking herself for not sending more guards with her as she sent two men in search of Skyler and Deke.&nbsp; In a matter of minutes they were calling her to explain that they had called for an ambulance since they had found Deke unconscious on the front landing.&nbsp; 

Hanging up the phone, Chelsea dropped onto the sofa where she began to cry.&nbsp; As the rest of the women began fighting their own tears, Hunter made his way to Chelsea, giving her one of his best hugs.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

�Is mommy with daddy?�&nbsp; Hunter asked.
�Yes sweetie, she is,� Chelsea confessed as Hunter hugged her tighter.
�Mommy always says don&#8217;t wowwy, she&#8217;ll be okay,� Hunter assured Chelsea as he patted her back.

Chapter 20

When Skyler began waking up, she had a fuck of a headache, but considering she was tied on her stomach, naked to a bed, it seemed like the least of her worries.&nbsp; She tried shouting, immediately realizing her mouth had been taped shut.

Looking around the room, Skyler tried to see if anything at all looked familiar, but it didn&#8217;t.&nbsp; She did notice she was cold, so she didn&#8217;t think they were in any kind of a regular house, it actually seemed more like a cabin and she was alone, but there was no way she could get out of the ropes.&nbsp; 

The door opened and Tyler walked into the room with an armload of wood.&nbsp; After throwing some wood on the fire, he walked over to sit on the edge of the bed.

�I&#8217;ve been thinking of how to make you love me again and then it occurred to me that you never have loved me, have you?�&nbsp; He asked with tears in his eyes.

Tyler stared at her for a moment before reaching over to pull the tape off her mouth and crawling onto the bed, draping his own body partially over Skyler&#8217;s as he began to cry.&nbsp; 

�That&#8217;s not completely true Tyler.&nbsp; I was starting to love you when you brought Hunter toys and the times we actually made love and when you played with Hunter and Tristan, I thought I could love you then, but then you got mean again,� Skyler explained.
�So the times I was gentle were the only times?�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m sorry, I wanted to try, but you don&#8217;t even treat me like a person most of the time.�&nbsp; 
�I can&#8217;t let you go.�&nbsp; 
�I know.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m gonna have to make it so you can&#8217;t run away when I have to go out.�&nbsp; 
�And nobody will find us here?�&nbsp; 
�No, nobody will find us.�&nbsp; 
�And you&#8217;re okay with just me being here?�&nbsp; 
�You&#8217;re all I&#8217;ve ever wanted, even if you don&#8217;t wanna be here.&nbsp; You had another kid, what was it?�&nbsp; 
�A girl, Trinity Ellen.�&nbsp; 
�You&#8217;ve always had cool names for the kids.&nbsp; Any more that we have, I&#8217;m gonna have to deliver.�&nbsp; 
�I know.�&nbsp; 
�We need to get married again.�&nbsp; 
�I know.�&nbsp; 
�And you&#8217;ll cooperate?�&nbsp; 
�Do I have a choice?�&nbsp; 
�I think you know what I&#8217;ll do.�&nbsp; 
�Then I&#8217;ll cooperate, just like I always do?�&nbsp; 
�You&#8217;re usually pretty good about that I guess, but you know I need to punish you right now.�
�I know.�&nbsp; 

The entire conversation was completely civil, seeming normal to Tyler and yet sickeningly familiar to Skyler. 

Tyler got off the bed, undressing before he crawled on top of Skyler, violently ramming his cock into her anus.&nbsp; That was always Tyler&#8217;s punishment and it hurt like hell every time.&nbsp; As Skyler screamed out in pain, Tyler shoved her face into the bed, muffling her cries as he slammed into her ass, harder and harder.&nbsp; It seemed that the more Skyler screamed the more determined he became to show her this type of behavior was completely unacceptable.&nbsp; Brutally Tyler continued slamming his cock into Skyler until she did no more than sob quietly until he eventually ejaculated inside her.

Tyler smiled as he rolled off Skyler, untying her before taking her into his arms and wiping the tears from her eyes.&nbsp; After wrapping his legs and arms around her, Tyler easily fell asleep, leaving Skyler to gently sob until she eventually fell into her own fitful sleep.

Over the following week, Tyler took the time getting reacquainted with Skyler, discovering his favorite position to keep her in, was tied to the bed.&nbsp; Looking at her so helpless caused him to become immediately hard and he loved watching her struggle to get out of the ropes as he cut off her oxygen, waiting until her eyelids began to flutter before letting her take a breath.&nbsp; During these times, Tyler would regain his hardness almost before he would finish ejaculating inside Skyler.&nbsp; 

The only thing able to pull Skyler through any of what was happening to her, were her thoughts of the children and her time with Chelsea.&nbsp; She could only hope there were enough happy memories to keep her from losing her sanity.&nbsp; 

When it came time to get remarried, Tyler took no chances of them being tracked down, driving her across the state line into South Dakota, stopping at the first small chapel he saw.&nbsp; 

Tyler&#8217;s smile grew as he led Skyler into the tiny church and caught sight of the elderly minister.&nbsp; He fit so nicely into Tyler&#8217;s ultimate plan as he smiled and welcomed the &#8216;happy&#8217; couple.&nbsp; 

Once the simple service was complete, Tyler sent his wife out to the car, instructing her to wait while he took care of the minister, giving her a kiss and a slap on the ass as he aimed her towards the door. 

The moment Tyler had the certificate of marriage in his hands; he laid it down on the desk, turning his back to the frail old man as the thin gloves from his pocket were slid onto his hands.&nbsp; When he turned around again, the minister looked into Tyler&#8217;s eyes and smiled.

�This is only going to end badly for you son,� the man said gently.
�Not nearly as badly as it&#8217;s about to end for you old man and I&#8217;m not your son.�

Tyler stepped forward, pulling the pistol out of his pocket and placing it into the man&#8217;s hand prior to guiding it up to the side of his head.&nbsp; As the minister told Tyler he forgave him, there was a small &#8216;pop&#8217; before the elderly man dropped to the floor.&nbsp; Finding the bathroom, Tyler cleaned himself up before putting the gloves back into his pocket.&nbsp; On his way out of the church, he made sure the certificate was in his hands.

Skyler forced a smile to her lips when she saw Tyler headed out of the chapel.&nbsp; Automatically, Skyler slid into her spot next to the driver&#8217;s seat, fastening her seatbelt before Tyler crawled in behind the steering wheel.&nbsp; Handing Skyler the certificate to hold, Tyler leaned in, giving his woman a kiss before making the long drive back to the cabin.

Tyler had managed to keep Skyler hidden for over three months to that point, but other than Tyler&#8217;s parents, who weren&#8217;t talking, nobody could figure out exactly where he was hiding her.&nbsp; Skyler had come to her own conclusion, realizing that with Tyler Sr. being a realtor, he probably had many ways of keeping her whereabouts hidden. 

In his own true form, Tyler had created a harness for Skyler out of chain link connecting the ends between her shoulder blades with a padlock.&nbsp; Another length of chain was padlocked to the bed, allowing her to move around the cabin for cleaning and cooking whenever Tyler was gone.&nbsp; 

Watching a variety of hospitals, Tyler eventually tracked down the last two men from the ambulance that had touched Skyler.&nbsp; He was actually sickened as he watched them walk out of the hospital holding hands, thinking about them with their hands on his property and the sickness in Tyler made him believe these two men were singularly responsible for making Skyler think it was alright to let girls touch her. 

After opening the car door to throw up, Tyler slowly followed behind as the men walked to their apartment.&nbsp; Slightly worried, he noticed the buildings looked very well tended as he scanned them quickly.&nbsp; 

As he looked into all of the balcony windows along the back side, he noticed one of the men opening the curtain on a first floor balcony and he felt more relaxed about the task in front of him.&nbsp; Tyler sat outside the building until it was dark and the lights had gone out.&nbsp; 

Tyler grabbed the glasscutter out of the glove box, but then he saw one of the men walk outside with a drink and watched as he sat down in the lawn chair.&nbsp; Putting the glasscutter back, he reached into the backseat of the car for a length of nylon cord before putting on his gloves and getting out of the car.&nbsp; Slipping around the corner, Tyler approached the man from behind just as he was about to stand up.&nbsp; Tyler quickly eased the cord around the man&#8217;s neck as he looked up at Tyler with shock.&nbsp; With one jerk, he heard the man&#8217;s neck snap, smiling as he watched him slump back into the lounger.&nbsp; 

Tyler tucked the rope into his pocket as he went in through the sliding doors of the apartment, quietly making his way through the living room.&nbsp; Glancing around, he noticed an antique tomahawk hanging on the wall and reached up to grab it off the hooks before heading toward the lights down the hall.&nbsp; As Tyler peeked around the corner into the bedroom, he could see the second man lying on top of the blankets without any clothes on and his eyes closed.&nbsp; Tyler took this opportunity to plant the hatchet so deeply into the man&#8217;s skull that the only part of it still sticking out beyond his skin was the handle.&nbsp; 

He was amazed and yet pleased after noticing the blood splatters on the wall, but none seemed to have hit him.&nbsp; Looking at himself in the bedroom mirror, Tyler confirmed that he had done what he was supposed to do since there wasn&#8217;t a speck of blood on him anywhere.&nbsp; Considering the entire night a complete success, he decided it was time to return to his loving wife. 

Walking back to the car, Tyler noticed it was a particularly warm night for March and he understood why the man had gone outside to have his drink.&nbsp; On the entire drive back to the cabin, all Tyler could do was smile. 

Chelsea would have spent her entire inheritance to find Skyler if she thought it would help, but she had absolutely no clue where to even begin looking.&nbsp; Taking Tyler&#8217;s parents in for questioning had been absolutely futile.&nbsp; Either they didn&#8217;t know what their son was up to, or they were protecting him and even though Chelsea was positive it was the latter, the best she could do was sit and wait for the reports to come in.&nbsp; 

The kids had been getting quieter and quieter as every day went by without bringing their mother back home.&nbsp; Chelsea had no other choice but to start the boys in therapy sooner than she had planned and remain hopeful it would help.

Tyler walked into the cabin several days later when he found Skyler throwing up in the bathroom.&nbsp; After giving her a wet washcloth, he held her close as she cried, both of them knowing what was about to happen.

 
Tyler was almost sobbing as he unlocked her harness before taking off his own clothes and making her lie down on the bed.&nbsp; Skyler&#8217;s begging suddenly made him angry as he forced his forearm against her throat, waiting until her eyelids began to flutter before sliding his cock inside and pounding her as hard as he possibly could.&nbsp; Skyler was barely conscious when Tyler kissed her before he started punching her and once she passed out, he held her in his arms until it was time to clean her up.

Two days before her birthday, Skyler was able move around a little better.&nbsp; She was still incredibly sore and bruised, but she was making dinner for Tyler, trying to make the best of the entire situation.&nbsp; 

He hadn&#8217;t touched her since the day he beat her and thought he would give her until her birthday, but he actually thought he wanted to do something nice for her first.&nbsp; He had been letting her wear a robe over her harness when he was gone, so she wouldn&#8217;t get too chilled, but he knew how she liked flannel pajamas, so his thought was to get her a pair.&nbsp; 

As Tyler walked into the house, Skyler was just walking out of the bathroom with the plunger, stopping dead in her tracks when she saw him.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t positive why she froze, but it most definitely made him suspicious about what she had been up to.&nbsp; She tried explaining that the sink was beginning to clog, but when he ran the water everything was moving along smoothly.&nbsp; She insisted that it hadn&#8217;t been and when he became irate that she was talking back to him, he beat and sodomized her again, getting so rough with her that her ass began to bleed.&nbsp; Tyler cleaned her up, taking her in his arms to let her cry.&nbsp; 

�You have to kill me Tyler, I can&#8217;t take this anymore.&nbsp; You either need to kill me or I&#8217;m gonna do it myself,� Skyler sobbed. 
�I could never let you go, you know that,� Tyler said, softly kissing her head.&nbsp; �I wish you could just accept the fact that you&#8217;re mine.�&nbsp; 
�I wouldn&#8217;t mind being yours if you weren&#8217;t so volatile with me.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t wanna do this anymore, please, just kill me, please?�&nbsp; 
�I bought you a present for your birthday.&nbsp; Happy Birthday.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not even mad at you for forgetting mine,� Tyler stated, Skyler staring at him in disbelief.

There was nothing else for her to do but open the package and thank Tyler before he helped her into the new pajamas.&nbsp; Skyler was a little surprised that Tyler wasn&#8217;t expecting any special treatment in return for the gift, but he seemed content to just lie in bed and hold her.&nbsp; 

Skyler relaxed enough after a while to put her arm across Tyler&#8217;s stomach before drifting off to sleep and Tyler was actually enjoying the closeness again.&nbsp; He had forgotten how gentle and loving she could actually be before little Tyler had been born.&nbsp; Tyler was beginning to remember that when he wasn&#8217;t slapping her, they actually had some pretty good times together.&nbsp; This was warm and it occurred to him that maybe he would go with it for a while, at least until she pissed him off again.&nbsp; He wasn&#8217;t sure it would work, but if it made her stop talking about killing herself, he would at least give it a try. 

After a nap about a week later, Tyler leaned in, gently kissing Skyler, slowly unbuttoning her top as he kissed her shoulders and her arms, moving on to her chest and her nipples and as her heart began beating faster, he began massaging her nipples with his tongue and fingers.&nbsp; 

Skyler forced herself to begin fondling Tyler&#8217;s nipples while he continued manipulating hers as they started kissing again.&nbsp; She smiled at him, removing her own pajamas before sliding down to massage his balls, kissing and caressing them as she began licking up and down his shaft before dipping the mushroom tip into her mouth, licking around and into the slit as she slipped her entire mouth over it and down until his crotch hairs tickled her nose.&nbsp; 

She had finally been able to give him the blowjob of his dreams and hadn&#8217;t gagged, not even after swallowing his cum.&nbsp; Tyler was so happy that he began kissing Skyler all over her body as his hands played with her nipples.&nbsp; 

He slowly slid down her body, dipping his tongue through her incredibly wet center.&nbsp; He smiled, believing she was wet for him alone.&nbsp; He dipped his tongue into her vagina, licking and swirling as he pulled out to sweep up through her center again.&nbsp; 

After several more trips through Skyler&#8217;s hole, he ran his tongue up and over her clit, sending her immediately into an orgasm and when she had finished, rather than to keep going so he could fuck her, he slid back up to hold her in his arms.&nbsp; 

Skyler lay in Tyler&#8217;s arms with a smile on her face.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t sure how to deal with this Tyler.&nbsp; He was being kind and gentle, actually thinking about her pleasure again.&nbsp; Tyler was being so good to her that it was scaring her more than if he was continually mean and the worst part was she knew it would never last.&nbsp; 

Even with her being worried, Skyler tried to go with it, actually having conversations with Tyler and he actually began talking with her.&nbsp; Tyler had been asking about the kids and actually enjoying the stories Skyler was telling him about the games they were playing and how big they were getting.&nbsp; She even began to feel hopeful that he might actually be able to show the love for his children that she had always wanted him to.&nbsp; 

As the months continued to pass them by, Tyler was still being nice to her and Skyler was actually beginning to relax a little more and then it occurred to her she was pregnant again.&nbsp; When she told Tyler, he was genuinely happy about the entire thing.&nbsp; 

The day Tyler&#8217;s father walked into the cabin, Skyler actually felt her anger rising to the surface as she watched him carrying groceries inside.&nbsp; Tyler had been gone for almost an hour by then and as the shock hit her, she hadn&#8217;t even noticed him staring at her from the doorway because she was too busy glaring at Tyler Sr.&nbsp; As soon as Tyler&#8217;s father welcomed her back, her eyes followed his to Tyler, forcing her to look down immediately.

Tyler waited until he heard his father&#8217;s car leave before moving quickly to slap Skyler across the face.&nbsp; 

�We were doing so great and you had to fuck it up!&nbsp; You know you&#8217;re not supposed to be looking at people, but you just had to do it, didn&#8217;t you?!&nbsp; You had to fuck everything up when we were getting along so well!�&nbsp; Tyler shouted as he hit her again.
�I was just surprised to see him Tyler!&nbsp; Stop hitting me� please?!�&nbsp; 
�You lying bitch!�&nbsp; 

Skyler tried convincing Tyler that she wasn&#8217;t lying, but he was sick of listening to her argue and the Tyler she knew and feared was back with a vengeance.&nbsp; Holding her by the neck, he continued backhanding her across the face until her eye was swollen completely shut.&nbsp; Turning the focus from her face, he ripped her pajamas off in one swift move, tossing her face-first onto the bed before unzipping his jeans.&nbsp; Tyler kneeled on the backs of Skyler&#8217;s legs, causing her to scream until he punched her in the back of the head.&nbsp; She began fading in and out of consciousness as Tyler slammed her in the ass with his cock yet again.&nbsp; He was violently pounding into her hole as the door flew open and police were all over him in a matter of seconds.&nbsp; Skyler opened her eyes long enough to see Chelsea trying to cover her nakedness before losing consciousness again.

Chapter 21

When Skyler woke up, she was in the hospital and her arm was in a cast.&nbsp; At first she thought Tyler may have broken it again, but Chelsea later explained that the doctors had broken it so it would heal properly.&nbsp; 

Other than incredibly sore and battered, Skyler mostly seemed okay as she opened her good eye, immediately smiling at Chelsea.&nbsp; 

�I knew you&#8217;d find me sooner or later.�&nbsp; 
�I wish it could&#8217;ve been sooner,� Chelsea lamented.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t know how long it would&#8217;ve been if his dad hadn&#8217;t driven all the way down here to pick up groceries.�&nbsp; 
�Did his dad get into trouble?�&nbsp; 
�He claimed he thought you were there of your own free will since Tyler told him you had gotten married again.�&nbsp; 
�So he thought I was chained to the bed of my own free will?�&nbsp; Skyler asked, tears in her eyes.
�I don&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s trying to make them believe, but he&#8217;s gonna be in jail until the trial.�&nbsp; 
�How long is Tyler going away this time?�&nbsp; 
�I guess it all depends if they get him for the judge and his wife.&nbsp; They said that a bolt had been loosened, but Tyler&#8217;s mother says he was with them and the guy that was watching him doesn&#8217;t say any different.&nbsp; For kidnapping and rape and whatever else he did to you, I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; He&#8217;s so damn slippery that I just don&#8217;t know.�&nbsp; 
�He made me lose another baby,� Skyler informed her, just in case it might help.
�I don&#8217;t know honey.�&nbsp; 
�I guess we&#8217;ll deal with it as it comes, but besides you, all I want are my babies.�&nbsp; 
�I know; my mom, your mom and Heather are coming with them all.&nbsp; I called a little while ago and told them we found you.&nbsp; Hunter&#8217;s been especially worried about you and none of the kids have even played since you&#8217;ve been gone.�&nbsp; 
�My poor babies and you too, it looks like you haven&#8217;t slept much.�&nbsp; 
�Not much.�&nbsp; 
�Did I lose this baby?�&nbsp; 
�No and you&#8217;re not married either, it wasn&#8217;t legal.&nbsp; D&#8217;you remember the minister at all?&nbsp; Did you see Tyler with the minister?�&nbsp; 
�Tyler made me go back out to the car and wait for him while he paid the minister, why?�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m so sorry baby, the minister died right after the wedding.&nbsp; It looked like suicide, I was just hoping he had slipped up this time, I&#8217;m so sorry,� Chelsea explained.
�I can&#8217;t deal with this right now, I know I have to, but please don&#8217;t make me deal with this right now.�&nbsp; 

At that very moment the door opened and Skyler was looking into the eyes she had been waiting so long for.&nbsp; The kids didn&#8217;t care what she looked like, as long as mommy was home again.&nbsp; 
She took the girls first, Tristan and Logan crawling onto her next.&nbsp; Hunter stood beside the bed patting her arm, fighting his tears.

�Aren&#8217;t you coming up sweetie?�&nbsp; Skyler asked in a shaky voice.
�I&#8217;m too big to do that.�&nbsp; 
�Okay, but what if I&#8217;m not?&nbsp; Would you come up for me?�&nbsp; 
��&nbsp; Okay, for you mommy,� Hunter agreed, making his way onto the bed.

He protested, but he had a hint of a smile on his face and as soon as the group was complete, they all fell asleep, including Skyler.

Skyler walked into the house four days later with the help of Chelsea, Val and Matt.&nbsp; The kids went to her as soon as she arrived.&nbsp; 

She always felt so much better as soon as she saw them.&nbsp; Skyler made her way to the sofa that was set up for her and had children clinging to her the entire time.&nbsp; They were chatting up a storm and Skyler loved it.&nbsp; 

Her mother and sister were watching from a distance while Frannie took Skyler coffee as soon as she sat, knowing how much Skyler loved her coffee.&nbsp; 

During this time, Chelsea had begun making plans to have one big birthday party for all of the birthdays Skyler had missed while she was gone, including her own.&nbsp; 

She and Val were keeping a lot of secrets, but she wanted Hunter to have a good seventh birthday.&nbsp; Tristan had turned five and Anna had turned one while Skyler was gone and she knew they were in no mood to have a happy birthday at the time, but they could enjoy it once their mother was home again.&nbsp; 

They all sat around the living room while the kids had all fallen asleep on Skyler.

�I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen children that feed off their mother as much as yours do,� Val commented.
�It is odd, isn&#8217;t it?�&nbsp; Asia asked.
�They know I wouldn&#8217;t be here without them,� Skyler admitted.&nbsp; �I begged Tyler to kill me once, but he gave me a pair of pajamas instead and then he scared me even more by being nice.&nbsp; I&#8217;m glad he couldn&#8217;t do it though,� Skyler said, smiling at Chelsea.&nbsp; �I think the child that&#8217;s coming now is the one I&#8217;m most afraid of,� she commented, pushing Tristan&#8217;s hair from his eyes.
�Why?�&nbsp; Heather asked.
�Because it happened while Tyler was actually nice to me.&nbsp; I mean, he was really trying for a while and he was sweet and gentle, at least until I saw his father and I was so shocked that I stared at him for the longest time, that was what made Tyler snap.�&nbsp; 
�You could not have it,� Heather suggested.
�No I couldn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s not his fault.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll have him and love him just as much as I love the rest of them, no matter what.�&nbsp; 
�The therapist is gonna start coming over tomorrow morning.&nbsp; She&#8217;s gonna be talking to you and the kids.&nbsp; The kids were talking to her for a little while, but after a few weeks, they pretty much stopped saying anything, so she&#8217;s gonna start over with them,� Chelsea informed her.
�Good, I think I need to talk to someone and I&#8217;m sure they need it too.&nbsp; I think they&#8217;re afraid to leave me alone right now.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;d say,� Matt said as Skyler smiled at him.
�Even as a man, you don&#8217;t understand how Tyler&#8217;s mind works do you?�&nbsp; Skyler asked him.
�To that extent, no,� Matt answered.
�The only way I think I&#8217;ve ever been able to understand it is that Tyler&#8217;s a drug addict and I&#8217;m his drug.&nbsp; He knows he could live without me, but he&#8217;s not willing to do it.&nbsp; As long as he&#8217;s alive, I&#8217;ll never be safe from him.�&nbsp; 
�Kinda limits your options, doesn&#8217;t it.�&nbsp; 
�Kinda, but it also means that anyone that decides to be around me pretty much is taking their lives into their own hands,� Skyler informed them.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m like a drug to him, but I&#8217;m a disease to anyone else.&nbsp; The kids are safe because he knows I&#8217;d never cooperate if he ever hurt them.&nbsp; He always threatened to hit Hunter and Tristan, but he only did that because he knew I&#8217;d do what he wanted me to then,� Skyler said, she shutting her eyes.

Skyler fell asleep almost immediately and she slept until the next morning.&nbsp; She had no idea that the kids had even gotten off of her and was surprised to wake up and find Chelsea sleeping in the recliner across from her.&nbsp; As she began to move around, Chelsea woke up.

�You okay?&nbsp; You need help?�&nbsp; Chelsea asked, moving to Skyler&#8217;s side in seconds.
�I&#8217;m okay; I just need to go to the bathroom.�&nbsp; 
�Why is this feeling so weird?�&nbsp; 
�I have no idea, but it does, doesn&#8217;t it,� Skyler agreed.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t like it.�&nbsp; 
�Me either.&nbsp; Maybe once we talk to the therapist.�&nbsp; 
�Maybe,� Skyler agreed as Chelsea helped her into the bathroom.&nbsp; �Where&#8217;re the kids sleeping?�&nbsp; 

Chelsea led Skyler to the big bedroom and opened the door to see Asia on one side of the bed and Frannie on the other with all the kids, right down to Anna, in between them.&nbsp; Skyler smiled as Chelsea reached around her to point at the crib in the room.&nbsp; Skyler stepped quietly into the room to see Trinity sound asleep in her crib and her smile widened as she left the room.&nbsp; 
She put her arm around Chelsea&#8217;s waist as they walked back into the living room.

�You kept them nice and safe, you&#8217;re a good mommy.�&nbsp; 
�This upsets you in some way; doesn&#8217;t it?�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t think so, that&#8217;s what I wanted� shit, I never even asked how Deke was doing after that.&nbsp; Is he okay?&nbsp; I know Tyler must&#8217;ve hit him on the head.�&nbsp; 
�Hit him on the head and crushed his hands.&nbsp; We couldn&#8217;t figure out why he crushed his hands until it occurred to us that he must&#8217;ve touched you at some point to calm you or whatever.&nbsp; He said you had a bad feeling before you even got to the front door.�&nbsp; 
�I did.&nbsp; I think he did touch my arm just before I put the key in the door.&nbsp; I smelled the cigarette smoke when I opened it, but by the time I pulled it shut, Deke was already out cold and then my own head was crashing into the door.�&nbsp; 
�If you had a bad feeling, why didn&#8217;t you come back and let someone check the house?�&nbsp; 
�Because Deke put his hand on my arm and assured me that everything would be fine,� Skyler explained as she got comfortable on the sofa.
�What a dumb ass,� Chelsea said as she sat on the coffee table.
�I thought when you picked him out that you were picking out the best.&nbsp; Seemed overconfident to me.�&nbsp; 
�Yeah, because you&#8217;re such a great judge of character,� Chelsea stated, leaving the room with Skyler staring after her.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m sorry, I have no idea where that came from, I&#8217;m just sorry,� Chelsea claimed, dropping to her knees in front of Skyler.
�You&#8217;re right; I&#8217;m not a good judge of anyone.&nbsp; The only one I ever chose to be close to was Tyler and you chose me, I didn&#8217;t choose you, so you&#8217;re right.&nbsp; The only other friends I have are your friends.&nbsp; I think I need to get a little sleep,� Skyler said, closing her eyes.

Chelsea had no idea where to even take that conversation.&nbsp; She knew that they might actually have a fight if she pushed it and decided that maybe the therapist could lighten the mood a little once she got there, so she left to make some coffee and breakfast for the family.

Upon opening the door, Chelsea suddenly became happy, making Skyler take notice as she watched the little show at the door while Chelsea hugged this strange woman.&nbsp; Getting off the sofa, Skyler never took her eyes off the two women, as Chelsea raced to her side.&nbsp; 

�D&#8217;you need to go to the bathroom?�&nbsp; Chelsea asked.
�You and I need to talk,� Skyler said, holding Chelsea&#8217;s hand all the way into the bedroom.&nbsp; �D&#8217;you really think I&#8217;m gonna spill my guts to someone you slept with?�&nbsp; Skyler asked once the door was shut.
�How� what� she&#8217;s the best in her field,� Chelsea stated with a look of confusion as Skyler picked up the phone and began dialing.
�Val, if you needed a therapist, what would you do if Matt set up an appointment with someone he had slept with, even if it was before you got together?�&nbsp; Skyler asked as she held the phone out so Chelsea could hear her.
�I&#8217;d string him up by his nuts and after that I&#8217;d give him a good smack.&nbsp; Like I&#8217;d wanna tell anything to someone he had seen naked.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think I could even get that picture out of my mind enough to talk to her, why?�&nbsp; Val asked.
�Thanks Val, I&#8217;ll talk to you later,� Skyler said, hanging up the phone.&nbsp; �I guess I&#8217;ll take second best then and I don&#8217;t want our children telling her what we all lived through either,� she went on.&nbsp; �You either, just in case you wanted to know,� 

While Skyler made her way back to the sofa, Chelsea escorted the therapist out the door and after almost half an hour she walked back inside as Frannie walked in from the kitchen.

�What happened to the therapist?&nbsp; That was Lenore, wasn&#8217;t it?�&nbsp; Frannie asked.
�You wanna explain it, or you want me to?�&nbsp; Skyler asked.
�Skyler doesn&#8217;t wanna talk to her since she and I were together� before,� Chelsea stated.
�You and Lenore?�&nbsp; Frannie asked, a look of shock spreading across her face.&nbsp; �Why&#8217;re you so stupid?�&nbsp; 
�What?!&nbsp; That was a long time ago!�&nbsp; 
�I can&#8217;t believe I raised such a stupid daughter.&nbsp; I guess that would explain why she always defended you when I talked to her.&nbsp; I need to find a new place to live.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t believe how stupid you are!�&nbsp; Frannie exclaimed leaving the room. 
�I&#8217;ll go find someone else right now, I&#8217;m sorry,� Chelsea apologized, hanging her head as she left the room.&nbsp; 

Skyler lay on the sofa as children began climbing onto her after they had their breakfast.&nbsp; As Frannie began to protest, Skyler informed her that she wasn&#8217;t hungry anyway and the kids were exactly what she needed right then as the entire group fell asleep again, only waking up when they began to hear shouting in the kitchen. 
 
Skyler could hear Frannie and Chelsea shouting at one another as Hunter, Tristan and Logan began to cry, closing their eyes and covering their ears.&nbsp; Heather saw their faces and ran into the kitchen dragging both women into the living room to point out Skyler trying to calm down the boys.&nbsp; Frannie and Chelsea both went over to show them that everything was okay, but they looked at Chelsea as though they were almost afraid of her.

�You don&#8217;t need to look at Mommy C. that way you guys; you know she loves you all more than anything, don&#8217;t you?�&nbsp; Skyler asked.

They were hesitant at first, but slowly they began to smile again as Chelsea got onto her knees and began hugging them all as she reached her hand around them to lightly touch Skyler&#8217;s cheek.&nbsp; Once the boys all seemed fine again, Skyler asked the rest of the women if they could take the kids out back so she and Chelsea could talk for a few moments.&nbsp; 

�So what&#8217;s going on?&nbsp; I know you&#8217;re upset with me, but you need to be open with me and tell me why.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m not upset with you, I&#8217;m upset with me.&nbsp; I felt so helpless while you were gone and there wasn&#8217;t anything I could do about it.&nbsp; I knew you&#8217;d be pissed if I left the kids alone if something had happened to me, so I had to depend on secondhand information and you were gone for so many months it was as though life had just stopped for all of us, but everyone kept looking at me like it was all my fault and I felt like it was too.&nbsp; Mom even asked why I only sent one guy with you, but it just never occurred to me that he would actually get hold of you.&nbsp; I was so careless with you and it pisses me off!&nbsp; I&#8217;m pissed at me!�&nbsp; Chelsea exclaimed, beginning to cry.

Skyler pulled Chelsea onto the sofa with her and held on until Chelsea was all cried out, gently pushing the hair away from Chelsea&#8217;s tearstained face.

�I don&#8217;t blame you; shouldn&#8217;t that count for something?&nbsp; I think that you know as well as I do that he would&#8217;ve taken 10 of them out if he would&#8217;ve had to in order to get to me.�&nbsp; 
�But you begged him to kill you.�&nbsp; 
�Yeah, but it was just enough to let him actually be human again for a while.&nbsp; I think he could actually be a good man if he wasn&#8217;t insane.�&nbsp; 
�Are we gonna be okay though?�&nbsp; 
�I think that as long as we can talk everything out we should be okay� and if you stop flaunting old lovers in my face.&nbsp; My only old lover is Tyler and that doctor was gorgeous.&nbsp; That was just really dense on your part, don&#8217;t you think?�&nbsp; 
�Well, I didn&#8217;t until everyone told me it was.&nbsp; Now I can see where it may have been a really bad idea.�&nbsp; 
�Better late than never I guess.&nbsp; Just don&#8217;t do it again.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m right there with ya.�&nbsp; 

They had just begun kissing when there was pounding at the front door, making Chelsea fall off the sofa as Skyler laughed.&nbsp; Chelsea poked her lightly on the arm before running to answer it.&nbsp; As she opened the door, Val pushed her daughters into the house and asked where the rest of the kids were.&nbsp; Chelsea informed her that they were playing in the backyard, so that was where she sent the two of them.&nbsp; Once the door was closed, Val walked up to Chelsea and began shaking her by the shoulders.

�What in the hell is wrong with you?!&nbsp; Are you stupid?!&nbsp; Matt told me what you did and I couldn&#8217;t believe it at all?!&nbsp; Jesus Christ girl, how thick are you?!�&nbsp; Val had finally run out of breath.
�Val, we&#8217;re okay now,� Skyler informed her.
�Yeah, and I&#8217;ve had it with being called stupid now, so just so you&#8217;re aware, the whole thing was your husband&#8217;s idea and he didn&#8217;t think it was so stupid when he suggested it.&nbsp; He thought I could get a better deal because I knew her.�&nbsp; 
�So, you&#8217;re saying you were bargain-basement shopping for someone to help your family?�&nbsp; Val asked.
�No!&nbsp; No, I wasn&#8217;t, that&#8217;s just what he said to me.&nbsp; I reminded him that we had gone out before, but he didn&#8217;t see where it was that big of a deal since he takes you and the girls to that dentist and you never seemed to have a problem with her, and, you didn&#8217;t know, did you?�&nbsp; 
�Way to go honey,� Skyler said, giving Chelsea a frown.
�You&#8217;re all right, I&#8217;m an idiot!&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry I&#8217;m such an idiot!�&nbsp; Chelsea shouted as she went outside.
�You did know, didn&#8217;t you?�&nbsp; Skyler asked.
�I knew,� Val said as she and Skyler began laughing.
�It&#8217;s a little different with a dentist I think.�&nbsp; 
�A lot different and besides that, he dumped her for me, so as long as my teeth are okay and I can flaunt the children she never got to have with him, that&#8217;s okay.&nbsp; He goes to a different dentist though,� Val pointed out as the women laughed again.
�I should go talk to her.&nbsp; She&#8217;s been beating herself up so badly about not being able to help find me and that she didn&#8217;t send more guards with me, but it wouldn&#8217;t have mattered.&nbsp; It just would&#8217;ve caused him to kill somebody, so Deke actually got off lucky for touching me,� Skyler said, getting up.
�Stay, or go watch the kids, but let me talk to her first, okay?�&nbsp; Val asked.
�Sure, I could use some fresh air anyway.�&nbsp; 

Skyler went to the backside of the picnic table and sat while Val walked over to Chelsea, giving her a hug before getting into a serious discussion.&nbsp; Skyler knew at that moment she was actually in love with Chelsea when she felt the twinge of jealousy creep in as she watched the two women hugging.&nbsp; She pushed it away just as quickly realizing she had probably been around Tyler too long.&nbsp; 

Turning her attention to the kids, Skyler wished she felt up to playing with them and then she heard Stephanie and Alyssa asking Hunter why their mommy&#8217;s face looked the way it did.&nbsp; She continued listening as Hunter explained that whenever she was with his daddy she looked like that.&nbsp; Sitting quietly, she hung her head as the boy explained that his daddy was sick and the only one he liked was Logan, but he couldn&#8217;t explain why.&nbsp; 

Skyler felt her insides tighten up before going back into the house to get some coffee; soon Chelsea was putting her arms around her.

�You okay?�&nbsp; 
�I just had to listen to Hunter try to explain to Stephanie and Alyssa why his father only likes Logan and why my face always looks like this when I&#8217;m with his daddy.&nbsp; I hate Tyler so much and I&#8217;m not real happy with myself either,� Skyler said as she turned around to hold onto Chelsea.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m a horrible mother; I shouldn&#8217;t be having another baby.�&nbsp; 
�You&#8217;re a wonderful mother.&nbsp; Those kids adore you.�&nbsp; 
�Kids don&#8217;t always know what&#8217;s best for them.�&nbsp; 
�They may not always know what&#8217;s best for them, but they know that you adore them and those kids have absolutely no doubts about how much you love them.�&nbsp; 
�But is love enough?�&nbsp; 
�It&#8217;s all there is baby, the rest&#8217;ll come in time and they&#8217;re gonna open up to the new therapist, I&#8217;m sure they will.�&nbsp; 
�They&#8217;ve already been talking to her?�&nbsp; 
��&nbsp; Yes?�&nbsp; Chelsea asked, looking at Skyler with her eyes wide.
�Why couldn&#8217;t she get them to keep talking?&nbsp; I mean she is a professional.�&nbsp; 
�Honey, they wouldn&#8217;t even talk to me, they weren&#8217;t talking to anyone.&nbsp; They pointed, nodded or shook their heads and did things themselves.&nbsp; Nobody was making them budge until you came home again.�&nbsp; 
�They were feeding off your mood.�&nbsp; 
�You think?�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;d put all my money on it� if I had any money that is,� Skyler said.&nbsp; �So d&#8217;you really think she&#8217;s the best there is, or was that just your own personal opinion?�&nbsp; 
�She&#8217;s rated tops in her field in the entire state.�&nbsp; 
�So maybe you should get her back again.�&nbsp; 
�Are you serious, or is this a trick?�&nbsp; 
�I just mean for the boys� since she&#8217;s already been working with them, I mean they&#8217;re probably used to her and all by now; right?�&nbsp; 
�I think she was getting through to them at first, but you weren&#8217;t here to say it was okay to open up to anyone else, so they wouldn&#8217;t.�&nbsp; 
�Hmm, I see,� Skyler said, walking out the back door.

As Skyler opened the door, it was almost as though they all knew she was coming for them.&nbsp; Hunter took hold of Anna&#8217;s hand before calling for his brothers to follow him and mommy as Heather asked her if she wanted Trinity too.&nbsp; Skyler nodded as Heather took the baby over to her.&nbsp; Once they were all inside, Skyler led them into the bedroom, helping them to get settled on the bed.

�What happened to all of you while I was gone?�&nbsp; 
�What do you mean mommy?�&nbsp; Hunter asked.
�Well, I just mean, why did you all stop talking?�&nbsp; 
�Scawed,� Tristan said, looking at his hands.
�Scared of what?�&nbsp; 
�Daddy,� Logan said.
�Scared of daddy about what?�&nbsp; 
�Logan doesn&#8217;t wanna go with daddy.&nbsp; We stayed together so he can&#8217;t take him,� Hunter explained.
�So as long as you stayed quiet and together, nobody made you do anything apart?�&nbsp; 
�Yes,� Hunter replied.
�You are all so smart and I love you all so much.&nbsp; If the lady doctor comes back to talk to you, will you talk to her then and tell her everything you&#8217;re afraid of?�&nbsp; Skyler asked as she watched all the kids whispering to each other.
�Okay mommy,� Hunter agreed.
�Are you talking for everyone?�&nbsp; 
�Yes mommy,� he answered.
�Okay then, how come you didn&#8217;t wanna tell this to Mommy C., or nana, or grandma or Auntie Heather?�&nbsp; 
�Scawed,� Tristan said again.
�Scared of what then?�&nbsp; 
�Evwy time we asked fo you, they cwied,� Tristan answered.
�Oh, I see.&nbsp; Even Mommy C?�&nbsp; 
�Yes mommy,� Hunter answered.
�Okay then.&nbsp; You wanna go play with the girls again?�&nbsp; 
�Can we?!�&nbsp; Hunter asked, getting excited.
�Sure, let&#8217;s go,� Skyler said, slowly getting off the bed with Trinity while Hunter handled the rest.

Skyler walked out of the bedroom and asked Val if she could handle the kids in the backyard so she could talk to the other children.&nbsp; Val smiled as she took Trinity outside with the rest of the kids.

�We just had a very nice talk.&nbsp; What did you all do when those kids asked about me?�&nbsp; 
�Why?�&nbsp; Heather asked.
�They were afraid that Tyler was going to come for Logan so they wanted to stay together to protect him.&nbsp; Hunter and Tristan said they tried to talk to you, but whenever they mentioned me you would all start crying and after a while they were afraid to mention me to anybody.�&nbsp; 
�Shit.&nbsp; We suck,� Heather said, looking around the room.
�That&#8217;s my sister, right to the point.&nbsp; You can&#8217;t do that if it happens again.�&nbsp; 
�Again?!&nbsp; What makes you think it&#8217;ll ever happen again?!�&nbsp; Asia asked in a panic.
�I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s giving up on me anytime soon mom, d&#8217;you?�&nbsp; 
�You sound so okay with that,� Chelsea pointed out.
�We just finished fighting; you really wanna have another one?&nbsp; You know I&#8217;m not; it&#8217;s just inevitable as long as he&#8217;s alive.&nbsp; I just wanna know that the kids have adults around them when it does and not a bunch of blithering women.&nbsp; They needed you to be strong for them, but Hunter had to be the strong one� again.&nbsp; You were the one that said he needed to be a boy before he became a man, so if it happens again, try and remember that�&nbsp; Christ!�&nbsp; Skyler shouted before going back outside.

She sat at the picnic table again and smiled at Val and the kids.&nbsp; Soon Chelsea was sitting next to her and putting her head on Skyler&#8217;s shoulder.

�Still love me?�&nbsp; 
�Do I really need to answer that?�&nbsp; Skyler asked, glancing at her.&nbsp; �You know I do.&nbsp; I must since I actually felt a little jealous earlier when I watched you hug Val after I watched you hug that other woman.�&nbsp; 
�No reason to be jealous of anyone, I&#8217;m head over heels in love with you, don&#8217;t you know.�&nbsp; 
�I hope I do, mostly I do.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m sorry about how I acted when you were gone.&nbsp; I should&#8217;ve been stronger about the whole thing.&nbsp; You were right and if it ever happens again, I&#8217;ll be better.�&nbsp; 
�I know you will.&nbsp; Listen to him laughing.&nbsp; Isn&#8217;t that one of the best laughs you&#8217;ve ever heard?&nbsp; I love how they all laugh.&nbsp; What d&#8217;you suppose Val&#8217;s doing to get them laughing like that?�&nbsp; 
�God only knows and I&#8217;m afraid to find out� I think she&#8217;s� no way,� Chelsea stated, walking over to look.

As Chelsea reached the little group she turned to look at Val&#8217;s face, becoming completely grossed out, which only made the kids laugh harder as Chelsea made her way back to Skyler.

�What&#8217;s she doing?�&nbsp;&nbsp; 
�Turning her eyelids up.�&nbsp; 
�Huh?�&nbsp; Skyler asked as she stood.
�You don&#8217;t wanna see it, so don&#8217;t go there,� Chelsea warned.

Skyler walked over and looked at Val&#8217;s eyelids as the kids continued laughing.

�Is that easy?�&nbsp; 
�Not really.�&nbsp; 
�Does it hurt?�&nbsp; 
�No, not really, just makes my eyes water sometimes,� Val explained.
�Did you guys try it?�&nbsp; Skyler asked, looking down at the kids.
�No.&nbsp; Can we mommy?�&nbsp; Hunter asked.
�If you really think you need to, but when your eyeball pops out of your head, you&#8217;re picking it up yourself,� Skyler stated before walking back to Chelsea.
�Didn&#8217;t that gross you out?�&nbsp; 
�Very much.&nbsp; I guess I&#8217;m good at hiding my emotions sometimes.�&nbsp; 
�Well at least they aren&#8217;t trying it.�&nbsp; 
�I told them they had to pick up their own eyeballs if they fell on the ground.�&nbsp; 
�You did not?�&nbsp; 
�I did, and I meant it,� Skyler assured her.&nbsp; �It sure does feel nice to sit outside.�&nbsp; 
�It does when it&#8217;s with the right company.�&nbsp; 
�I love you too,� Skyler said, smiling at Chelsea.

Chapter 22

As the household began returning to normal and all the therapies were going well, Tyler&#8217;s trial was coming up.&nbsp; Skyler wasn&#8217;t positive what she was going to do, but she had been thinking long and hard as to whether or not she was going to go.&nbsp; The entire group was sitting in the living room a few days before the trial and after all the kids had been put to bed.

�I just can&#8217;t decide what to do.� 
�I can&#8217;t even believe you&#8217;d seriously be considering what you&#8217;re considering,� Heather said.
�I know, I don&#8217;t understand it either, but I just can&#8217;t bring myself to hate him and yet I do hate him all at the same time, but I can&#8217;t hate him completely even though he was mostly horrible; I know that, but then I look at the kids and I just can&#8217;t.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t explain it, but it&#8217;s like there&#8217;s some good in him somewhere.&nbsp; There has to be because he gave me them.&nbsp; It just is what it is I guess.&nbsp; I think Chelsea gets a little impatient with me about the whole issue, don&#8217;t you honey?�&nbsp; 
�It gets a little nerve-wracking from time-to-time, but I&#8217;m trying to be understanding,� Chelsea admitted.
�And you are and I love you for it.� 
�She&#8217;s always been like that.&nbsp; When she was younger, anyone could lie straight out to her and she always believed whatever they&#8217;d tell her and then she&#8217;d go on to believe the second lie used to cover the first lie.&nbsp; She&#8217;s kinda dopey that way,� Heather explained.
�Why should that be my problem?�&nbsp; Skyler asked defensively.&nbsp; �Isn&#8217;t that more the liars problem?&nbsp; I mean if you felt you had to do that when you were a little shit, should I really have been the one to tell you what a shit you were?�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t know, I guess since I was in the wrong and you were older, maybe you should&#8217;ve corrected me,� Heather insisted.
�So I should try and convince them to help Tyler instead of just locking him up and doing nothing.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a good idea Heather, thanks.�&nbsp; 
�Yeah, thanks Heather,� Chelsea said sarcastically.
�I didn&#8217;t exactly mean it that way,� Heather sputtered.
�I may not owe it to Tyler, but I owe it to our children to try and help him get better.�&nbsp; 
�What if you can&#8217;t?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any cure for what he has,� Chelsea explained.
�But I watched him change.&nbsp; He was sweet and loving and he didn&#8217;t hurt me for the longest time this time.&nbsp; He laughed and cried when I talked about the kids� and I mean all the kids.&nbsp; He was actually trying, but then his father walked into the cabin and I was just so shocked that I wound up staring at him and that was when Tyler flipped out.�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t know for sure what your point is,� Chelsea admitted.
�Well, if they can even partially cure him, show him how he needs to treat other people, stuff like that so he can at least give all of his kids&#8217; hugs.&nbsp; He sure knew how to treat Logan.&nbsp; So why just him?&nbsp; Just because he had his name?&nbsp; I just don&#8217;t get it I guess,� Skyler admitted.&nbsp; �I want him, at some point, to give all of his children hugs and tell them he loves them, I can&#8217;t help it, that&#8217;s what I want.�&nbsp; 
�Might not be in their best interest to be around him at all,� Asia pointed out.
�I can&#8217;t believe that,� Skyler said to her mother, knowing she was thinking about her father.&nbsp; �I know I wouldn&#8217;t trust him alone with any of them, but I think it might help them to know that he didn&#8217;t just use them to keep me in line.�&nbsp; 
�But he did!&nbsp; He used everyone you loved to keep you in line,� Chelsea reminded her.
�I know.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just being a stupid sap, aren&#8217;t I?�&nbsp; 
�No, you&#8217;re being a forgiving sap,� Chelsea said with a smile.
�I think I&#8217;m going to bed, my brain hurts.&nbsp; You coming?�&nbsp; Skyler asked Chelsea.
�I&#8217;ll be in shortly.�&nbsp; 
�Goodnight everyone.&nbsp; I love you all; I hope you know that, but I think I need to go in and talk to Tyler tomorrow,� Skyler said, leaving everyone staring after her.
�Amazing,� Heather said.
�She is, but I hope she&#8217;s not too upset when it never happens.&nbsp; I just don&#8217;t think he has the ability,� Chelsea said.
�I don&#8217;t know why she&#8217;d want that after what he did to her father and all those kids,� Asia commented painfully.
�She can&#8217;t think about anything but the children.&nbsp; They were all she had to hold onto for six years plus,� Frannie stated.
�I guess,� Asia agreed.
�She can&#8217;t afford to let herself despise him for their sakes.&nbsp; She&#8217;ll do what she can and let them decide for themselves, but she&#8217;ll never cut him completely out of their lives,� Frannie added.
�And on that note, I think I&#8217;ll join the crazy pacifist,� Chelsea said, leaving the shrinking group.

Chelsea crawled into bed, sliding behind Skyler who was already asleep.&nbsp; As she put her arm around her, she felt Skyler tense as she took a sharp breath and then she relaxed as she felt the smaller, gentler hand on her stomach.&nbsp; Skyler rolled over, being careful not to hit Chelsea with her cast.

�You think I&#8217;m crazy, don&#8217;t you?�&nbsp; 
�No, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re crazy.&nbsp; I think you might place too much faith in his ability to act normal, but that&#8217;s one of the reasons I love you,� Chelsea said, kissing her on the head.
�I&#8217;m so glad you found me again.&nbsp; Did I ever tell you thank you for that?�&nbsp; 
�Over and over.�&nbsp; 
�Did I ever show you this way?�&nbsp; Skyler asked, kissing Chelsea tenderly on the lips.
�No, I&#8217;m pretty sure you left that part out,� Chelsea said as they kissed again.
�How about this part?�&nbsp; Skyler asked as she began kissing down her neck.
�Nope, you left out that part too,� Chelsea smiled, helping to undo the buttons on her top.

Chelsea focused on most of the undressing, so Skyler&#8217;s cast wouldn&#8217;t get in the way.&nbsp; Skyler smiled as she moved in to kiss Chelsea deeply before making her way down to the officer&#8217;s breasts.&nbsp; 

She had seriously missed those beautiful nipples and couldn&#8217;t stop herself from devouring them with her lips.&nbsp; Skyler sucked, nibbled and flicked them with her tongue.&nbsp; Back and forth from one nipple to the other and then back again as Chelsea ran her fingers through Skyler&#8217;s hair.&nbsp; 

Skyler began kissing her way down Chelsea&#8217;s stomach, making her way through that blondish-red bush that she adored, kissing down, through and around, letting her tongue slip into her vagina, up through her vulva, around her clit and back down to do it all over again.&nbsp; As Chelsea was about to go crazy, Skyler moved over to kiss and lick one thigh before moving to the other leg for a repeat performance.&nbsp; 

Chelsea was making some of the sweetest sounds as she began to whimper before Skyler went back to dip into her vagina and through her vulva again until she ended her travels at her clit, pushing hard against it with her tongue before flicking it.&nbsp; Chelsea actually squealed; causing her to slap her own hand over her mouth as her hips began to thrust against Skyler&#8217;s face.&nbsp; The moment she calmed down to small aftershocks, Skyler giggled as she made her way back up to lie on Chelsea.

�What in the hell was that sound you made?�&nbsp; Skyler asked, still laughing.
�Oh my god, that was scary, wasn&#8217;t it?�&nbsp; 
�Kinda like an injured bird,� they both laughed.
�You think you can calm down so I can do the same thing to you?&nbsp; Maybe I can make you come up with some strange sounds.�&nbsp; 
�C&#8217;mon baby, do your best,� Skyler dared her, rolling onto her back.
�Sounds like a challenge,� Chelsea said cracking her knuckles.

Skyler smiled as she pulled Chelsea over for one of her best kisses before Chelsea began kissing her way down Skyler&#8217;s neck and body, stopping at her nipples, licking, kissing, sucking, back and forth from nipple to nipple until Skyler&#8217;s entire body was thrusting towards Chelsea.&nbsp; 

As Chelsea began moving down further, she licked and kissed Skyler&#8217;s thighs, hoping it would have the same effect it always did on her, it did and soon Skyler was opening her legs wide, to Chelsea.&nbsp; 

Chelsea began kissing around her clit, circling it with her tongue moving down to her vagina, moving back up again, circling, one more circle and into her vagina again until Skyler began begging her to finish what she started.&nbsp; 

When Chelsea moved back to Skyler&#8217;s thighs, she let out a slow, long whimper until Chelsea moved back to circle her clit once more before pressing her tongue directly onto Skyler&#8217;s clit and the sound that came out of her seemed as though it came from deep inside and sounded almost animalistic.&nbsp; As Skyler began to push on Chelsea&#8217;s head, the officer was doing some giggling of her own as she made her way back up to Skyler&#8217;s face.

�You know I only did that so you wouldn&#8217;t feel silly, don&#8217;t you?�&nbsp; Skyler asked, trying to look serious.
�You&#8217;re so full of shit,� Chelsea scoffed.
�I know, but it was worth a try.�&nbsp; 
�I love you.�&nbsp; 
�I love you too.�

Skyler and Chelsea held onto one another as both of them began to giggle again before drifting off to sleep.

Hunter was bouncing on the bed the next morning with a big smile on his face.&nbsp; It occurred to Chelsea that they never put their pajamas back on after their night.&nbsp; Skyler smiled at her, knowing exactly what she was thinking.

�That&#8217;s a nice smile Hunter, I like it.&nbsp; Why&#8217;re you so happy?�&nbsp; Skyler asked.
�I&#8217;m just happy because we&#8217;re all together.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m happy about that too.&nbsp; You wanna go see if grandma and nana are up yet?�&nbsp; 
�Sure mom!�&nbsp; Hunter shouted excitedly, jumping off the bed and running out of the room.
�God I love that kid.� 
�He&#8217;s special,� Chelsea agreed, quickly throwing on some clothes.
�I could look at you forever and never get tired of it.�&nbsp; 
�I could look at you forever too,� Chelsea agreed, crawling onto the bed to kiss Skyler.&nbsp; �But unless you want the entire household staring at your naked body, which let&#8217;s not, you should get some clothes on.� 
�Thank you for last night.�&nbsp; 
�Thank you, it was wonderful.�&nbsp; 
�Mommy&#8217;s up!�&nbsp; Hunter ran screaming through the hallway, encouraging Skyler to rapidly put on some clothes.

That afternoon, once her cast was removed, Skyler found herself in a room with Tyler.

�You okay Skyler?�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m fine, you?�&nbsp; 
�Missing you.�&nbsp; 
�You have to stop that Tyler, you need to concentrate on getting better,� she encouraged.&nbsp; �If you keep obsessing about me, you&#8217;re not concentrating on getting better.�&nbsp; 
�There&#8217;s nothing wrong with me,� he protested with a look of surprise on his face.
�Tyler, how can you even believe that?�&nbsp; She asked, lowering her voice.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re hurting me, our children and the people I care about because you think I&#8217;m too close to them, that&#8217;s not normal,� she said, looking around nervously.
�Are you trying to say something?�&nbsp; Tyler asked, seeming annoyed.
�I&#8217;m trying to help you get better,� she said, taking out the latest picture of her and all the kids.
�Is that little Tyler?�&nbsp; He asked, pointing at the picture.
�Yes, but what about our other kids Tyler?�&nbsp; 
�We make some cute kids, don&#8217;t we?�&nbsp; 
�They&#8217;re beautiful, but I want you to be able to tell them you love them someday.�&nbsp; 
�Why Skyler?&nbsp; If you think I was so bad to you, why?�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m beginning to wonder,� she confessed.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t know, everyone else thinks I&#8217;m crazy,� 
�I think you actually love me,� he said with a grin.
�I love the children you gave me, so I guess in some sick way that extends out to you, but it&#8217;s not the kind of love you want me to feel.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve never felt that,� she admitted.
�Then what the fuck&#8217;re you doing here?!&nbsp; I only ever wanted you; you wanted them so I let you keep them.&nbsp; You can&#8217;t ever forget me as long as you have my namesake.�&nbsp; 
�I can&#8217;t ever forget you completely because I have six years history with you, and if you look at that picture, three of them look exactly like you.&nbsp; I came here to see if you even want help, otherwise they&#8217;re gonna lock you up and throw away the key one of these days; so what&#8217;s it gonna be?�&nbsp; 
�You saying that you&#8217;re on my side Skyler?�&nbsp; He asked, looking at her and feeling confused.
�I&#8217;m saying that I&#8217;m on our kid&#8217;s side.&nbsp; I just think there&#8217;s a gentle side to you somewhere in that mess and I&#8217;d like them to get to know it.&nbsp; I know there&#8217;s a gentler side because I&#8217;ve seen it.&nbsp; You keep it pretty well hidden, but I know it pops out every once-in-a-while.�&nbsp; 

Tyler sat and stared at Skyler for a few minutes and he almost felt like laughing and crying at the same time.&nbsp; What could be better than to have the one person you&#8217;re in trouble for hurting be on your side?&nbsp; 

�I do want help.�&nbsp; 
�That&#8217;s all I wanted to hear,� she said, standing up.
�You leaving already?�&nbsp; 
�Yeah.&nbsp; Your stuff starts this afternoon and I wanna talk to your lawyer and the judge first.�&nbsp; 
�Okay, but am I gonna see you again?�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a good idea Tyler.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll just keep thinking you can be with me or that I wanna be with you and I&#8217;m sorry, but I don&#8217;t,� Skyler said as Tyler began to cry.&nbsp; �That&#8217;s not gonna work here.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m sorry; I never meant to hurt you.&nbsp; I love you, I&#8217;ve always loved you,� he said, wiping his eyes.

Skyler, being Skyler stood up, walked over to Tyler and hugged him as he stayed in his chair while leaning into her.

�I&#8217;ll do what I can, okay?�&nbsp; 
�Thank you Skyler.�&nbsp; 

Chelsea was in the other room listening to the entire meeting.&nbsp; Skyler knew she was in there and that was why she lowered her voice during part of their conversation.&nbsp; Watching as Skyler left the room, Chelsea shook her head, a look of disgust moving across her face as she stared at Tyler leaning back in the chair, his smile growing as the guard walked into the room.

�She knows I&#8217;m worth saving,� Tyler smiled.
�Yeah, you&#8217;re a prince.�&nbsp; 
�She&#8217;ll never admit it to anyone, but she loves me and she loves how I give it to her,� Tyler said proudly as he shoved the photograph into his pocket.&nbsp; 
�Sick fucker,� Chelsea muttered, unable to stop herself.

Chelsea walked out of the room to find Skyler before she got too far.&nbsp; She wanted to try one last time to talk her out of going through with her plan.&nbsp; As the officer caught up to her lover, she pulled her into an empty interrogation room.

�Please don&#8217;t go through with this Sky?&nbsp; I&#8217;m begging you.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m being an idiot; aren&#8217;t I?�&nbsp; 
�No, you&#8217;re not being an idiot, but you are being too forgiving.&nbsp; You know all the people you suspect him of killing, d&#8217;you really want him back out on the street?�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t know what to do Chels.&nbsp; I just want the kids to know the side of their father that I saw all those months,� Skyler cried, almost falling into Chelsea&#8217;s arms.
�I know you do, but what happens the first time they make him angry?&nbsp; I know you don&#8217;t want them going through what you did.&nbsp; Living every day of their lives terrified and with the new one coming, I just don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good idea.�&nbsp; 
�I can&#8217;t help him, can I?�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t think so sweetie, I think it&#8217;s too late,� Chelsea confessed, rubbing Skyler&#8217;s shoulders.
�If I help him, he&#8217;s just gonna tell everyone what they wanna hear and then he&#8217;s gonna come after me again, isn&#8217;t he?�&nbsp; 
�I think so baby.�&nbsp; 
�The kids are gonna hate me someday.�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t think so.&nbsp; The kids know how much you love them, they&#8217;re good kids,� Chelsea pointed out.&nbsp; �It might be the best way to keep them safe if you let him go.�&nbsp; 
�Will you tell him why?�&nbsp; 
�You know I will.�&nbsp; 
�Don&#8217;t take too much pleasure in it though.&nbsp; Promise me?�&nbsp; 
�Just a little pleasure maybe?�&nbsp; 
�Just a little.&nbsp; Can you take me home now?�&nbsp; 
�You know I will.�&nbsp; 

Chelsea sat in the back of the courtroom for the entire hearing with Tyler.&nbsp; It actually didn&#8217;t take very long and he was sentenced to 15 years and no less than 10 for what he did to Skyler.&nbsp; He wasn&#8217;t very pleased when he heard the sentence, cursing Skyler up and down.&nbsp; Tyler literally had to be carried out of the courtroom, completely losing his cool, calm exterior.&nbsp; 

Chelsea followed Tyler and the guards, directing them to a private room, asking them to stay put while she spoke with him.&nbsp; 

�You and my wife having a good fucking laugh?�&nbsp; 
�I know you think this is everyone&#8217;s fault but your own, but you don&#8217;t really believe that she loves you, do you?&nbsp; She&#8217;s scared to death of you and her wanting to help you had absolutely nothing to do with you, it had to do with something in the back of her head that says the children should have their father in their lives, but in your case I think it would do more harm than good,� Chelsea informed him as she watched the color drain from his face.&nbsp; �She wanted to help you, but she&#8217;s also afraid you&#8217;re going to just come after her again, and I can&#8217;t just stand by and watch that happen.�&nbsp; 
�You did that on purpose you bitch!�&nbsp; 
�I didn&#8217;t put the actions into your head and I sure didn&#8217;t make you abuse her all those years.&nbsp; She doesn&#8217;t wanna live with the constant threat of you to your own children.&nbsp; She knew in the end that you just don&#8217;t have the capability to care about your kids.�&nbsp; 
�You think you know the real Skyler, but you don&#8217;t.�&nbsp; 
�I think I know her better in the short time we&#8217;ve been together than you knew her in the six years you were with her.&nbsp; She&#8217;s a sweet and gentle woman and she would help everyone if it was possible and most of all she loves her children and her children adore her, better yet, I adore her and I&#8217;m willing to let her be who she is, not who I think she should be.�&nbsp; 
�What you two have isn&#8217;t even real.�&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;ll let her know that when we make love tonight.�&nbsp; 

That was where the guards had to hold Tyler back.&nbsp; He almost made it to Chelsea, but they managed to catch him just in time.&nbsp; 

Before walking out the door, Chelsea stopped to look back at Tyler, letting him know that his efforts to remarry Skyler were illegal and they were still divorced.&nbsp; If looks alone could kill, Chelsea would have dropped to the floor, but unfortunately for Tyler, all he wound up with was a smile before she walked out of the room.&nbsp; 

Chelsea walked into the house to find everyone sitting in the living room.&nbsp; The boys were sitting around their mother while the girls were playing on the floor.&nbsp; Skyler looked at Chelsea as she walked in.

�How long?�&nbsp; Skyler asked.
�Minimum of 10 years and he blamed me.�&nbsp; 
�I guess the important thing is that I don&#8217;t,� Skyler said, smiling at her.&nbsp; �Were you nice?�&nbsp; 
�Mostly.�&nbsp; 

Skyler got off the sofa and walked towards the boy&#8217;s bedroom.&nbsp; They had all been put back into one room since Heather, Asia and Frannie had moved in.&nbsp; 

Chelsea didn&#8217;t feel comfortable with her mother living alone anymore since she saw how easy it was for Tyler to get inside her house.&nbsp; 

The boys had been coached earlier and all three of them followed their mother into the bedroom.&nbsp; As Skyler sat on the bed, the boys all sat around her and she put her arms around all three of them.

�You all remember your daddy, right?�&nbsp; She asked as they all nodded at her.&nbsp; �Well, daddy did some bad things to mommy and when people found him they got pretty mad.&nbsp; You remember when you all came to see mommy in the hospital?�&nbsp; She asked, waiting for head nods again.&nbsp; �Your daddy is really sick and I can&#8217;t make him better.&nbsp; I tried because I wanted him to be a good daddy to you and your sisters, but I can&#8217;t make him better and daddy won&#8217;t say that he&#8217;s sick, so the people that got mad at him for hurting me, put him someplace where he can&#8217;t hurt any of us anymore.&nbsp; By the time he can even try to get out, Hunter will be 16 years old and by then you can all decide if you want to see him, but for now you just need to try and be little boys and play and have fun and give me and mommy C lots of hugs and kisses; okay?�&nbsp; Skyler asked them as they all nodded and hugged her.
�I&#8217;m glad daddy can&#8217;t hurt you anymore mommy; is that okay?�&nbsp; Hunter asked.
�That is better than okay,� Skyler said as she hugged them all.&nbsp; �Now I think we all need to concentrate on having a ton of fun, yeah?�&nbsp; Skyler asked as they all smiled and ran screaming towards the toy box.

Skyler smiled as she walked back into the living room and directly into Chelsea&#8217;s arms, giving her a kiss.&nbsp; 

�Thank you for putting up with me.�&nbsp; 
�I never put up with you, I love you.�&nbsp; 
�I think mom and Heather wanted to talk to you too,� Skyler said, leading her over to sit on the sofa as she watched the boys play.
�What&#8217;s up?�&nbsp; 
�Well, we were wondering if it would be too big of a burden if Heather finished school here and if I sold my house and hung around for a while?&nbsp; Maybe try and catch up on some of the time I wasted away from my daughter and my grandchildren.�&nbsp; 
�I don&#8217;t have a problem with that if that&#8217;s what Sky wants.�&nbsp; 
�I think it&#8217;s wonderful� look at them, it&#8217;s as if they haven&#8217;t got a care in the world anymore and they actually know how to shout,� Skyler laughed.
�Maybe you actually just set them free too,� Chelsea suggested.
�Looks like,� Skyler said, laughing again.
�I think that we may have put off that trip to the Fair long enough.&nbsp; Anybody else wanna go to the Fair tomorrow?!�&nbsp; Chelsea shouted.

The boys all began cheering as they ran to Chelsea to give her hugs.&nbsp; She could get use to seeing a house full of happy people and was sure was enjoying it at that moment, especially when she saw Skyler cheering along with them.

�I&#8217;ve never been to a Fair either,� Skyler admitted.
�Me either,� Heather agreed.
�I took you girls to the Fair in Babbitt every year when you were younger!�&nbsp; Asia protested.
�Mom, that was a carnival and you never let us do anything because you said the rides didn&#8217;t look like they were put together well and you said the other people looked too dirty for us to get food there.&nbsp; The only thing you&#8217;d ever let us do was the little hand crank game.&nbsp; I always wanted to try a corndog,� Skyler admitted.
�They&#8217;re excellent.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll love &#8216;em,� Chelsea assured her.

Chelsea was happy that Skyler didn&#8217;t get angry with her when she told her what she had said to Tyler.&nbsp; She was even happier when Skyler actually wanted to make love after the conversation, telling her there was no comparison and thanking Chelsea for making her feel so loved and wanted.&nbsp; Chelsea would never understand how anybody could get their kicks out of abusing someone as sweet as Skyler.
