Synopsis: Young Victoria awakes in a strange place, reminiscent of a hospital. Soon she endures intense body modifications, and is forced into a torturous body suit which will act as her prison. She is methodically turned into a human sex toy, intended for the pleasure of her owner.






 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Nnnngh� the young woman moaned, slowly regaining consciousness. The petite girl attempted to move as her mind lifted from the fog. She lay still mostly, for what seemed like hours. Seemingly unable to open her eyes, she remained motionless for so long that she wondered if she was actually asleep. Over time, she became more and more aware of herself, and finally regained the ability to lift her eye lids, though it took more effort than she could have imagined. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Victoria looked around the room as much as she was capable. For reasons unknown to her she couldn&#8217;t lift her head, and so she was limited to seeing only what was before her. All she could see was one wall, completely blank and painted white a few feet away. Above her, bright fluorescent lights beams down on her where she lay. Below she could see nothing, only the shiny metal surface that she was resting upon. It was like a doctors table, only much cooler to the touch as it had no padding. The young woman blinked a few times, slowly gaining more strength in her body. It was as if her ability to move had been zapped from her, and now it was slowly returning. &#8216;What happened to me?&#8217; she wondered. Terrified of the answer, Victoria resolved to find a way out of whatever this place was. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Nnnnngggh� she moaned again, as she strained against the weight of her own body. Her attempt to lift herself was fruitless. The strength just wasn&#8217;t there. �Nnnnnggh� Mmmmeh� she groaned, trying almost desperately to lift herself from the metal table. Panting for breath, she realized that this was very very wrong. She shouldn&#8217;t be in a place like this. Victoria didn&#8217;t even know what this place was. And she certainly shouldn&#8217;t feel like this; she should be able to move like normal.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As time wore on, her mind felt less and less foggy and thinking came easier to her. &#8216;Did I get roofied?&#8217; she wondered to herself. A headache was making its presence more known, the more awake she became. The throbbing in her head ached more with each beat of her heart, and Victoria closed her eyes tightly, attempting to drive the pain away. Her attempt was futile, and her heart only raced faster as she became more aware of her situation. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The room seemed like some sort of doctors office, though with her head tilted to one side she had no idea what was on the other. No sound penetrated the room, leaving Victoria alone with her own thoughts and fears. Perhaps if she called out for help someone would come. Maybe this was an emergency room, or detox or something. She could have been drugged and then brought in to recover� but that didn&#8217;t explain her inability to move. Victoria&#8217;s breasts heaved inward and outward, as she feared not being able to move again. &#8216;Oh God, why can&#8217;t I move?&#8217; she asked herself, fearfully.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suddenly, the sound of a twisting doorknob broke the silence. &#8216;Oh please help me&#8217; Victoria thought to herself. The noise of a door opening filled the room, and multiple sets of footsteps echoed from behind her head. Unable to turn to face the owners of those footsteps, Victoria did her best to see them using only her eyes. There were three of them, or perhaps four.&nbsp; Men and women both, dressed in full medical garb. White smocks, long rubber sleeved gloves, caps and face masks, clear plastic goggles, and aprons over it all. The appearance of these men and women terrified her. &#8216;Who are these people� and why are they dressed like this?&#8217;

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Three sets of hands descended upon her body, grabbing all of her limbs and pulling them away from her torso. Unable to move herself, Victoria had no defense against their probing hands. A fourth set of hands grabbed her head to either side of her face and straightened it, forcing her to stare directly upwards. The &#8216;doctor&#8217; who held her face stared back down at her, with only his dark brown eyes revealed behind his mask. He had soulless, evil eyes that struck fear into her heart. She stared up at him through her dark brown hair as some cascaded upon her face. Victoria let out a whimper, petrified of the people who molested her body while she lay defenseless. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The young woman couldn&#8217;t move, but she could feel their hands working on her. Unable to look down, she couldn&#8217;t see who was doing what, but she certainly felt it all. The long black dress that she&#8217;d worn out the night before was shorn down the center, and the thin shoulder straps were snipped away with ease. Her black bra and matching panties were cut away in similar fashion, and it was all torn out from under her with ease. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Wehhhah!� Victoria cried out, unable to make intelligible words. She continued to gaze up into the steely eyes of the man above her, and tears streamed down either side of her face from her bright green eyes. Never had she experienced fear like this, and she never thought that she would. &#8216;What is happening? Why are you doing this to me?&#8217; she wondered frantically.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now completely bare upon the cold metal table, Victoria felt a tickle along her upper thighs. Her attempt to look down but it was pointless, whatever they were doing down there was out of her view and blocked by the big round mounds of her breasts. Her bright pink nipples poked up into the air, stiff from the affects of the cold air. Victoria&#8217;s breathing became ragged as she felt the tickling sensation cease on her thighs, and the doctors moved up closer to her head. &#8216;What are you doing to me?&#8217; The same sensation was suddenly felt upon her arms, just below the shoulder. &#8216;Leave me alone, please. Let me go!&#8217; she thought. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The &#8216;doctors&#8217; worked quickly, and said nothing throughout the whole ordeal. Another sound that Victoria was somewhat familiar with filled the air. A gurney was pulled into the room right along side the metal table. The man who held tight to her head released her, and moved out of the way of his colleagues. Without warning, Victoria felt three sets of hands lift her and move her from the cool table to the soft padding of the gurney. From the gurney, she could see a woman standing with a pen and a clipboard, seeming to write something or check things off. Victoria couldn&#8217;t tell what, to be sure. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The woman doctor with the clipboard turned and exited the room, and the gurney started to move in pursuit. Victoria lay like a rag doll on the bed, breathing heavily and tears streaming from her eyes. Her nose was red and dripping. On either side of the gurney a man doctor pushed her along. From the bed she couldn&#8217;t make out where they were or where they were going, but the building certainly had a feel like a hospital. But the walls were all bare, with no decoration. Every door they passed was apparently made of stainless steel, and all were closed. There were no clues as to where she was, or what was happening to her. The only lighting was supplied by the overhead fluorescents, not a single window was to be seen. During the trip down the long hallway, they didn&#8217;t even pass other doctors or anyone at all. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The group of doctors brought Victoria along for a few minutes, and then all boarded an elevator. Unable to see the wall of buttons, Victoria had no idea what floor they were on or what floor they were going to. All she could feel was the elevator dropping for several floors, and the end of the descent was announced by a dull �ping� note. The group exited the elevator and drew the gurney out with them, with Victoria sobbing softly on board. They pushed her down another hallway and through a wide set of double doors into a big, open room. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A single glance around the room nearly made Victoria&#8217;s heart stop. The gurney was brought up along side another metal table, much like the one she&#8217;d only just left but with a few minor differences. Her body was groped by several hands and arms, and her naked form was lifted over to the new table. Victoria strained against her own inability to move as her arms and legs were separated. Her legs were split apart widely, and were rested upon small extensions of the table apparently designed just to accommodate her legs. Victoria&#8217;s arms too, were spread outward and rested on top of individual extensions to the table. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Myeehhh� she cried out, as she felt wide leather straps drape over her arms at the wrist and elbow. The tinkling of buckles was heard, as the straps were pulled tight. More straps were drawn over her legs at the thigh and ankle, and they too were restrained. Another pair of straps, wider than the others were drawn over her torso at her waist and above her bulging breasts. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�P�Pehhh� she whined, trying her best to speak. She did her best to convey her discomfort, but the doctors showed no sign of caring or even noticing. The man doctor who&#8217;d held her face earlier approached her once more, and held her face upwards just as he had before. As Victoria gazed up into his dark, unfeeling eyes she felt another doctor draw another strap over her throat. The young brunette woman choked as she felt the leather restraint tighten on her neck like a noose, and when it was done the man released her head. A final leather strap, this one comfortably padded was draped over her forehead and securely fastened down to the head of the table. Her whole body was now strapped down to the cool metal plateau, splayed out for all to see every inch of her nude body.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Pehhh�.� Victora tried harder to speak, to beg for release. She was so afraid. Out of her view, a doctor turned a crank and above her a gigantic metallic mirror descended to become parallel with the floor. Tears streamed from her eyes as she gazed up into the mirror, and saw herself spread out and defenseless. In the mirror she could see the heads of the doctors moving about her, setting tools and things she couldn&#8217;t identify. Victoria choked on her own fear as she looked at her body. At the tops of her thighs� and just below the shoulders� black dotted lines were drawn on her flesh. The young woman cried out in fear, terrified of the predicament.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Pluh� Plehhh�.� she cried. A metal cart, garnished with shiny tools and accessories was wheeled up beside her. All of the doctors surrounded the table, some holding tools and others paper work, one with a camera. Victoria glanced about the room at all of them. The man doctor who held her head approached her, with respirator face mask in hand. A plastic tube extended from it to a place unseen to her, but she knew what it was. The man drew the mask over her face, and sealed it up over her nose and mouth. Completely unable to move, Victoria had no means of resistance. The gas was released and she felt herself slipping away immediately.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Puh�lease�� she managed to stutter, as the whole world faded to black in an instant.









 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Victoria woke slowly, as if she were leaving a foggy field and reentering the real world. She couldn&#8217;t remember the moment when her eyes opened, it just felt as if they&#8217;d never closed. The young woman sat up, still and not completely aware of where she was or what her situation was. Her mind felt as if her wits had been dulled, and she had no recent memory of who she was or what she&#8217;d endured. Unable to turn her head for reasons unknown to her, Victoria just remained vertically perched up high against the far wall of a white room with cool white lighting. How she was kept in place on the wall was unclear to her, but in her state of mind she was not curious to find out.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the far end opposite end of the room, a door swung open and two figures trudged in. One was dress in clothes like a surgeon. He had a white smock and an apron, and long rubber gloves and a face mask and all. With him came a woman, dressed in a white doctors coat and carrying a clipboard. The two approached quietly, as if trying to keep from disturbing her. Victoria did her best to lift her head to meet them, from her perch against the wall.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How long has she been like this?� asked the woman.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ten weeks, ma&#8217;am. We only just allowed her to regain consciousness� replied the surgeon, his voice seemingly muffled and echoing at the same time. �Her incisions have healed nicer than we thought they would. I think we can move forward now� he said, talking with his hands. �Just wanted to run it by you first, ma&#8217;am.� The woman looked at the surgeon and nodded, then approached Victoria where she rested against the wall. She crouched down, and Victoria felt her hands run along the flesh along her buttocks and the separation of her womanhood. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Everything seems in order� the woman said. �What&#8217;s the condition of her muscles?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Excellent, ma&#8217;am� the surgeon responded. �We kept her muscles strong with electric shocks, and her body responded to it wondrously.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And her internals?� the woman asked.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Clean as a whistle, ma&#8217;am. We&#8217;ve cleaned her out once every few days since she arrived. Her last enema was this morning.� The man tossed his hands about in front of him as he talked, as if it helped explain what he was trying to say. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And her-�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Complete hair removal to the rest of her� the man said, cutting the woman off. �There is truly a zero percent chance that hair will grow on her again. Not including her head and eyebrows, of course.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Very good� the woman replied, with sharp annoyance in her voice. �Don&#8217;t interrupt me like that again, Doctor.� The surgeon looked taken aback for a moment, even behind his mask and cap.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, of course, ma&#8217;am� he responded. �Won&#8217;t happen again.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mmmmph� Victoria moaned, and felt startled by the noise she made. It was then that she noticed the presence of something in her mouth. Her state of mind had left her completely unaware of it until she attempted to voice her discomforts. Victoria ran her tongue around inside her mouth, feeling about the shape of a big and round shape that tasted of rubber. With her tongue she attempted to press the round rubber gag from her mouth, but it remained in place. The movement in her tongue even seemed sluggish, and she could feel the presence of some things seemingly clipped onto it. Unable to see her tongue to inspect it, Victoria disregarded the annoyance.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�She&#8217;s coming out of it, ma&#8217;am� the man said with a slightly concerned voice.
 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good� the woman replied, as she continued to inspect Victorias body. �I think you&#8217;re right; she&#8217;s ready to move forward in the process.� The woman looked down at her clipboard and flipped through a few papers. �Who was this one for?� she asked the surgeon.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Client C-12, ma&#8217;am� the man responded flatly. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh that one&#8217;s a fucking nut case� he goes through these things like candy� Well it looks like his order has been filled� the woman added. �Transport her to Dressage, and then oversee her departure from Shipping. I want her out of here by tonight so we can make room for the next one. Understood?� 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes ma&#8217;am� the surgeon replied, and with that the two exited the room. Victoria remained on the strange perch against the wall, staring blankly across the room. She made no attempt to move, only stayed still and stupefied. Her world was so cloudy, and her senses felt dulled to the point that nothing seemed to matter.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Soon the surgeon returned, accompanied by a pair of women dressed similarly to himself. The man pushed a wheel chair of some sort, but instead of a flat seat it had what looked more like a deep plastic bowl. Around the front were a pair of wide leather straps, fixed to the back rest. The two women approached Victoria and went to work on buckles previously unseen to her, as they were below her field of view. Victoria felt a pang of confusion as the two women lifted her with incredible ease and moved her over to the strange wheel chair. The collar around her throat continued to disallow her from looking down on her own body, but she could feel the work they were doing. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mmmmmph!!� Victoria moaned as she was seated down low in the bowl of the chair, the cold plastic coming in direct contact with her womanly slit. Unable to think straight, Victoria endured the treatment as the women pulled the leather straps around her front and secured her to the back rest of the chair. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�To Dressage� the man ordered, and the two women began to walk for the door. The man could be heard following close behind, his footsteps significantly louder than those of the woman. �Bring her down to Dressage and slot her for the preparations for client C-12� the man said to the women doctors. �Park her out from of the dressing room and wait for me there. I want to wait for the drugs to wear off before we start, this is the last we&#8217;ll see of little Tori.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The two women obliged and took down the hall, pushing Victoria along before them. The man turned off somewhere, and Victoria listened as his footsteps faded away. Down the long hallway, the small woman was delivered to a set of double doors. Victoria cringed in fear as some distant memory reached back from the deep recesses of her mind. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mmmmmph!� she cried through the gag, but there was no stopping the chair. The two women pushed her straight through and into a big and open room. A half coherent look around the room revealed small walls like cubicles dividing the room into sections. The cubicles were much taller than those found in an office, and the doorways to each was covered with a white curtain. Past several cubicles the women brought Victoria, and she shriveled in fear. Victoria was pushed along to a cubicle, where the women stopped. The woman doctor pushing her pressed a brake behind the wheels of the chair, and then the two stepped inside the curtain leaving Victoria alone to stare at the blank white surface. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From the other side of the curtain, Victoria could hear the doctors working on something. Perhaps they were making preparations of some sort, but the thought of what for worried Victoria worse than anything else. Looking around as much as the collar about her neck would allow, Victoria did her best to see where she was now. Slowly the world faded back into view, and the fog in her mind dissipated. As time went on, it slowed down. No longer did the whole world seem to fly by, and her senses began to return. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The big room echoed with the sounds clanking chains and muffled screams from all over. Victoria was unable to pinpoint the source of the noises, as they seemed to come from all different directions of the massive room. The collar hugging her throat prevented her from looking down or to either side of her, and so the only thing within her line of sight was the white sheet draped before her. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her memory slowly trickled back to her, one little bit at a time &#8216;How did I get here?&#8217; she wondered. &#8216;I� I was at a party� no a bar, I think&#8217; she remembered. &#8216;I� I was drinking and then�&#8217; that was it. That was as much as she could recall, until waking up here the first time. &#8216;The men and the women� those doctors�&#8217; she attempted with great difficulty to recall what had happened. &#8216;They tied me down. They tickled my arms� my legs� and they had a big mirror I think.� Victoria tossed her head about, as much as the collar would permit in an attempt to jog her memory. Try as she may, the whole memory of how she got into this predicament could not be attained.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Victoria tried to remember more, from before the party, or wherever she&#8217;d been before she was here. &#8216;I went to school. My friends wanted to go out� We went� We had dinner and rode in a car&#8217; she remembered, feeling like she was grasping for shadows. Remembering wasn&#8217;t easy, but she was improving with time. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mmmmphmm� she moaned into the gag, as she rolled her tongue along the protrusion in her mouth. It was more obvious now what had happened to her tongue. Judging by the feel of it, Victoria guessed that it had been pierced- and not just once. Now more aware, she realized that the gag was a big rubber ball lodged between her teeth. A leather pad rested over her mouth, and leather buckles wrapped around to the back of her head, securing the ball in place. Victoria pressed with her tongue and attempted to open her mouth wider, trying to remove the ball from her aching jaws. Her attempts were pointless, and in time she gave up. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Victoria attempted to lift her hands up to remove the gag herself, but she couldn&#8217;t even feel them. She wondered if perhaps the restraints were so tight that her limbs had become numb, and unresponsive. Her attempts to mentally fight the numbness in her arms proved useless, and in time she gave up on that as well. &#8216;Oh God please get me out of here&#8217; she thought to herself. &#8216;Please someone help me.&#8217; Victoria sat quietly in the bowl shaped seat of the wheel chair, and gazed upwards as best as she could. The ceiling was high, and adorned with fluorescent lighting and an assortment of wires and cables. Staring upwards, Victoria prayed to God and Jesus that they would save her and have her rescued from whatever this place was. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No sooner than she&#8217;d begun her prayers, a pair of loud footsteps could be heard approaching from behind. &#8216;Oh no, the doctor man is back&#8217; she thought. Victoria&#8217;s heart rate doubled over, as she heard the man come nearer. The man said nothing as he clicked off the wheel brakes, and then pushed Victoria through the curtain and into the cubicle. Victoria&#8217;s eyes widened and her breasts heaved with her labored breathing. It was difficult to breathe with the ball and leather pad sealing her mouth, thus leaving only her nose to supply her body with oxygen. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before her was a wide table, topped with a leather pad. Beside the table was a bench, covered in items that only vaguely resembled clothing, and strange contraptions which she couldn&#8217;t possibly identify. The man wheeled her over to the side of the padded table in the center of this massive cubicle, and the two women approached her from the front. Victoria watched in fear as the straps across her front were removed, and she grunted when she was unwillingly lifted from the chair. Victoria moaned in discomfort as she was laid down upon the padded leather table. She was grateful that at the very least, this table wasn&#8217;t bare metal. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Pull her hair free� the man commanded to one of the women. �You, prepare the cleaning station� he said to the second. The two women said nothing, only gave a curt nod and moved to complete the tasks they&#8217;d been assigned to. The first woman fished her hands about Victoria&#8217;s head, pulling free each and every strand of loose hair. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mmmmph� she moaned in pain, as her hair was pulled and tugged into a tight, high ponytail. The woman held her hair together in her hand, and tugged the ponytail toward the end of the table. �Errrmmmmpphh!� Victoria screamed through the gag, as she was dragged to the end of the table by her hair. The doctor pulled her until her shoulders met the edge, and her neck and head hung out in open air. Victoria tried her best to regain her composure, as she heard a set of wheels come near. One of the women pulled up a different kind of hand cart, directly under her head. With a foot pedal, the woman cranked the cart so that it rose to meet the small girl&#8217;s head.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mmmm� Victoria moaned in surprise, as she felt the sensation of warm water consume her scalp. Facing upwards at the bright ceiling lights, Victoria enjoyed the feeling of the warm water washing through her long brown hair. The women approached her from either side, and each went to work. One woman went to work massaging her scalp, and then began to wash a shampoo into her hair and scalp. The feeling of having her hair washed and her head massaged was so pleasant, that Victoria couldn&#8217;t help but allow her eyes to roll back in her head. She was in a state of bliss for a moment. Suddenly she felt a pinch in her eye brow and then a twinge of acute pain. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mmph!� she squeaked, and her eyes shot open. Above her, she saw the second woman looming over her with a pair of tweezers. The woman worked diligently, and at Victoria&#8217;s expense. For a long while, Victoria looked up into the faces of the two female doctors as they worked on her head. One took her time carefully massaging shampoo, and then conditioner into her hair, and then rinsed both from her scalp. The second woman moved her hands about Victoria&#8217;s face, plucking her eye brows and then applying a splotchy feeling makeup. The scent of the makeup was unmistakable, but it didn&#8217;t go on like powder, but instead more like a paste. Finally, the two women completed their tasks and the cart was pulled away. A towel was used to dry her long dark hair, and afterwards it was all tugged into a tight bun atop her head. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Remove the collar and the gag� the male doctor ordered to one of the women doctors. He turned to the other. The first woman approached her, and tilted her on one side. Victoria felt her fingers work a pair of buckles behind her neck, and soon both the gag and the collar became loose. She was grateful to feel them both coming undone, and battled back a smile as the ball finally popped free of her aching mouth. �Do not speak, girl� the man said from across the table. �One single word and you&#8217;ll regret it, I assure you.� Victoria said nothing, believing his threat. The man then turned his attention back to his female colleagues. �Finish the makeup� he commanded.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The two women moved immediately and wordlessly, one gripping Victoria&#8217;s head while the other came to her side holding a different item. Unable to inspect it closer, the small girl on the table could only see a wide metal ring, flanked by a pair of leather straps. The women moved simultaneously, one forcing her mouth open while the other slid the ring between her teeth. �Errrf!� Victoria protested, but her efforts to resist failed. Victoria groaned as the ring was tilted straight, forcibly propping her mouth wide open. She wailed as her attempts to reach up and stop them resulted in nothing. Why she could not move to fight them was beyond her.
 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From her side, the other woman then approached wielding a tube of lip gloss. The contents of the tube were a glossy, bright pink, and the woman removed the applicator wand covered in it. The applicator was run smoothly over her lips, painting them the beautiful pink color and leaving them looking lively and delightfully kissable. Victoria only moaned in discomfort as the women worked, finally finishing the addition to her makeup. Suddenly and without warning, the two women then gripped Victoria by the waste and flipper her over onto her belly. Her breasts were so massive, that her upper torso was propped up higher than the lower. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unable to see who was doing what, Victoria only whined in defeat as one woman gripped her hair by the damp bun atop her head and yanked back. With her head still dangling over the edge of the padded table, Victoria was forced to gaze straight forward with her head tilted back and her mouth jacked open. The second woman then approached from the side, holding a thick handled tooth brush. After applying white paste to the brush, the woman jammed it up under Victoria&#8217;s gums and went to work brushing away. The brush vibrated against her teeth and gums, half tickling and half hurting her through the whole process. Her moans of displeasure went unnoticed, but finally the brushing stopped. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With a handheld sprayer, the woman then approached Victoria&#8217;s gaping mouth once more. In an odd fashion, she then went to work removing all excess tooth paste from within her jaw. After completing the task, the woman then continued by wiping the little brunette&#8217;s fair and lips. &#8216;Why would they do that?&#8217; she wondered, &#8216;they only just put makeup on me.&#8217; Done with the wiping, the woman then stepped away and the other released her hold on Victoria&#8217;s bun. The two then each gripped her body and flipped her back over onto her back. From her front, the man then came forward and looked down at her, as if inspecting her. He then looked up to the two women and gave a curt nod, and only said �moving on, then.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The two women went back to work, one stepping forward with a strange form of a hook. It looked more like a grappling hook used in movies, but it was significantly smaller. The other woman quickly undid Victoria&#8217;s bun, but was carefully sure not to allow any strands of hair to run free. When the long hair was undone, the woman then wound it tightly and wrapped it into the odd looking hook. Her hair was now trapped in a tight bun once more, but with the odd hook mixed in. Unable to see what the women were doing, Victoria was completely reliant on her sense of touch. She could feel them working with the hook, and the clinking of chain could be heard as well. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suddenly, there was a painful yank on her hair. Victoria let out a grunt as her hair was again pulled hard, as if from the very root. A long, pained whine escaped her gaping pink lips as she was tugged closer to the edge of the table. Something was attached to the hook in her hair, and they were pulling on it. Victoria allowed herself to cry out in pain as her whole body finally fell from the table, only to swing out in open air. Her head was forced upright, and her body dangled uselessly below her. Victoria cried as the doctors continued to crank the chain, drawing Victoria high and higher until her head was at about their shoulder height. The male doctor stepped in closely, and put his hands out to stop Victoria from swaying about the way she was. The pain in her scalp was disturbing, but not nearly as bad as she would have thought. She wasn't as heavy as she thought she was. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mirror� the man said, and Victoria glanced about the room as the man held her in place. One of the ladies obliged and turned to a big rectangular mirror, locked in place on a set of wheels. The woman turned the whole dolly around, allowing the reflective side to face Victoria.
The small woman&#8217;s eyes shot open, and tears immediately flowed from them. A long and whiney screech came from her mouth as she looked into the mirror, and felt a fear like she&#8217;d never known before. Staring back at her was something that wasn&#8217;t her. It used to be her, but now it was a disturbing grotesquerie of her former self. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Victoria looked up and down at her reflection, eyeing what was left of her. She saw herself hanging freely in the center of the room, her dark brown hair tied up and taut above her. Her face was decorated with more makeup than she ever wore, with purple eye shadow and glossy, pink lips and rosy red cheeks. Her breasts seemed bigger than they used to, now appearing to be in the DD range or perhaps even bigger. With the ring gag still in place in her mouth, Victoria could see her tongue as well, though not very well. Her vision was clear enough to see a number of metal balls studded into it, apparently making a diamond formation. Victoria whined as her gaze lowered to her body.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The worst of it all was her missing limbs. Victoria looked and saw that her arms were missing. Wishing that it was just some kind of trick, she tried to tell her brain to move them, but&nbsp; nothing happened. The same occurred with her legs, which had apparently been removed in similar fashion. All four of her limbs had been amputated, and cleanly at that. The places where her arms and legs were once connected had almost no implication that they&#8217;d ever existed. Victoria looked at the short nubs that remained where her arms and legs once were, and there was truly no scarring whatsoever. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Victoria was allowed to hang freely and stare at he modified body, and cry to herself for a while. The man just held her in place and watched her reaction to the change, while the women could be heard preparing something at one of the work tables at the other end of the cubicle. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8216;How could this happen?&#8217; she asked herself. &#8216;How could people do this to me?&#8217; Her reflection time was cut short as the man spun her around to face the other side of the room. There in front of her, the two women doctors stood with a little purple sack of some kind, and other strange devices as well. The sack had a glossy sheen to it, and a zipper running down its center on one side. The women stepped in closer,&nbsp; one holding the opening out beneath the dangling girl&#8217;s bottom, the other holding long pads of white material. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first nurse stepped forward, and produced one of the long white pads. Victoria watched in fear as the woman peeled a backing from the pad, revealing that one side was covered in a type of adhesive like a sticker. The first pad was aligned diagonally across her left rib cage, spanning from just near her belly button and all the way up to where her armpit would have been. Victoria cringed at the touch of the sticky pad as it was pressed firmly into her soft skin, and clung to her when the nurse stepped away. The young woman dangled about, unable to defend herself. In no time, the nurse had attached a second sticky pad in the same location on her right rib cage. The two made a &#8216;V&#8217; shape from her belly button and beneath her breasts, wrapping around the front of her body. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The nurse then produced yet another pad, shaped oddly like an upside down &#8216;Y&#8217;. When the sticky backing was removed, the nurse stepped around behind the hanging girl and pressed that too into her soft flesh. Victoria moaned through the ring in her mouth, as the woman pressed the entire pad into her, almost like a rough massage. The pad now extended from the base of her neck, all the way down her spine until it split above her bottom. The two ends of the split each extended downward to be attached uncomfortably to her two round, plump buttocks. Now with the strange pads in place, the two nurses stepped away and came back together with the purple sack device held open between them. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Victoria contorted her muscles in resistance, attempting to turn away from the women as they approached. Her attempts to deny them were futile, as they almost effortlessly tugged the purple sack up Victoria&#8217;s body. The sack was tugged upward, pulling on her skin and rubbing against her nipples as it was pulled farther and farther up. In short order the sack completely covered Victoria&#8217;s torso, save for the few opening that allowed her womanly parts to remain bare. Before her, the man held Victoria in place while the women tugged on the zipper behind her back. The young woman couldn&#8217;t help but release a tormented moan as the glossy purple sack became taught, squeezing every inch of flesh. Victoria squirmed like a worm dangling on a hook, desperate for freedom but with none to be had. Every few tugs, one of the female doctors would turn her attention to Victoria&#8217;s breasts. She was unable to look down to see, but could feel that there were two wide openings in the front of the purple sack. Each hole was aligned with one of her breasts, allowing them to fall freely from the rubbery suit.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The female doctors finally pulled the zipper to the very top, the sack now so tight that it clung to every curve of her body. The zipper ran all the way to the nape of her head, and the purple material ran from the top of her throat down to her nether region. While the two female doctors turned back to the table, the male spun his tiny captive around to the mirror once more. Victoria could only stare at herself in disbelief and cringe. The purple material clung to her altered torso, as tightly as if it were her own skin. Only her massive, round breasts were allowed to pour out from the front, and a skinny slit was clearly visible at her crotch. Victoria felt a tear run down her cheek, mortified at what was happening to her. These people were just toying with her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suddenly the man turned her back once more, to face the women holding a new weapon&nbsp; of torture. The device confused Victoria, and she could only barely grasp what it was before they began to implement it. On the left, one female doctor held a large and intricate arrangement composed of one big piece of black leather and with a few other leather straps of varying length and size attached to it. The leather was glossy and adorned with all matching silver buckles, the inside layer apparently coated with tiny nubs of some sort. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The two women stepped in, and worked together to drape the device over Victoria&#8217;s vulnerable body. The young woman did the best she could to see what they were doing but with her head restrained the way it was, it was difficult. Victoria did well to understand what they were doing by the sense of touch, however. Each woman draped a wide leather strap over one of Victoria&#8217;s shoulders, where the man grabbed a hold to keep the device in place. Then the two female doctors was free to get to work on the main body of the strange contraption. Firstly, they went to work tightening the wide leather pad which aligned with Victoria&#8217;s belly, covering her waist and her ribs below the breast, and wrapping around to cover her lower back as well. Victoria understood now that this device was like an extreme corset, and that became clearer as the man pulled the straps tighter behind her. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Aaaaugh!� Victoria groaned, as the corset began to squeeze her rib cage inward. Her entire lower body suddenly began to feel the pain of what seemed to be thousands of tiny pricks in her skin. The small nubs that coated the inner layer of the leather device were digging painfully into ever inch of skin that it covered, causing poor Victoria to cry out in pain. The man only tightened the device even further, completely uncaring of the young woman&#8217;s suffering. �Aaaaugh!� she cried out again, her studded tongue flailing within her gaping jaws. Each time she thought the man had tightened the device as far as it could go, he seemed to go back to the start and pull each strap even farther. In no time at all, Victoria was feeling as though she couldn&#8217;t breathe at all. Every attempt to draw breath was cut short, like she could only gather a quarter of the air she could before. The barbs within the leather device dug menacingly into her skin, and suddenly Victoria actually felt grateful for the latex skin that separated her from it. At the very least, that would offer some protection. Surely the barbs weren&#8217;t pointed enough to break her skin, but they most definitely added to her torment.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With the main section of the leather device in place, the man and the two women were now free to get to work on the two straps that dangled about beneath her shoulders. Victoria grunted in defiance as the two straps over her shoulders were attached somewhere on her back, surely attaching to the back of the corset. They too were apparently studded with the tiny barbs, drawing another moan from the small woman as they dug deeper into her flesh. Victoria felt the man behind her working diligently to secure the shoulder straps as tightly as they could go. Each yank on the straps only prompted another grunt or cry from the young woman, dangling helplessly between her captors. Finally, the man seemed content with the tightness of the straps.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Below her area of view, one of the women produced a short but wide strap from where it had been dangling about Victoria&#8217;s breasts. The woman placed the strap against Victoria&#8217;s throat, and the man took it from there, tightening the tall collar about her slender neck. �Gaaah!� Victoria protested, disliking the feel of the prickling studs against her neck and throat. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8216;God, no!&#8217; she thought to herself. &#8216;I&#8217;m not some animal! You can&#8217;t do this! I&#8217;m a person!&#8217;

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The man tightened the high collar until it too restricted the small woman&#8217;s ability to draw breath, and her eyes bulged in fear of suffocation. The collar was tall and stiff, hugging the young woman&#8217;s neck uncomfortably, and the presence of the small prickly barbs did nothing to help. Victoria finally broke down completely, sobbing uncontrollably through the ring gag. Tears flowed freely down her cheeks and met each other beneath her chin. 









 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Finish that up� the man commanded to the two female doctors. �I want to watch.� Victoria tried her best to look around to see what the women were doing, but now she was left to hang freely in the center of the room. As she swung about, she finally caught a glimpse of the female doctors returning from the side table. Each was holding a device that made Victoria cry out in fear. The first woman approached with a long, thick, and terribly menacing looking dildo. The device was only vaguely comparable to an actual penis. It had the correct shape and curve to it, but it was far scarier. The dildo was black and at least ten inches in length, and a circumference of at least six inches. The horrifying phallus was decked with more pointy little barbs all the way up until the bulbous metal head. Victoria could see that the barbs were certainly not pointed enough to break skin, but they would surely be most uncomfortable. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first doctor stepped forward and dropped the dildo down out of Victoria&#8217;s few. She squirmed against the confines of the leather harness, but the thing was so rigid and tight that there was nothing she could do. Victoria could only hang in the open air and accept the massive dildo. A high pitched squeal escaped her as she felt the cool metal head press against her vulva, and she broke down in tears as the pressure began to mount. Completely unable to move, unable to resist, Victoria did her best to accept the massive sex toy as it was pressed painfully past her pussy lips. It felt so huge, so filling, that she was sure that it would tear her insides apart. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Gooooohhh� she moaned, drool dripping from her gaping mouth. �Aaaaugh� she groaned, doing her best to accommodate the gigantic phallus. As the penis was pressed further in, she began to feel the prickling of the barbs against the walls of her vagina. Every little push prompted another moan, as the pain doubled over and over. &#8216;How can they do this to a person?&#8217; she wondered to herself. &#8216;Why would they do this? It&#8217;s just too big.&#8217; As the device forcefully entered her, she felt her body reacting naturally. She began to feel aroused, and did her best to allow the devilish dildo to enter her. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But the doctors did not let up, and the woman continued to press the device into the limbless girl. Victoria could only look straight ahead, wishing that the doctor would look her in the eyes. Perhaps if she could just show her how much pain she was in, she would show mercy. But Victoria knew that was hopeless. It was clear that the point to all of this was to cause her pain and fear, and it scared her to know that. Every few inches the woman would pause and give Victoria a short breather, and for that she was grateful. To accept something so huge was a daunting task, especially when she had no control over the pace, and when there was apparently no lubrication aside from what her body could produce.
 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, Victoria felt the woman&#8217;s hand press against her vulva. Victoria moaned, almost pleasurably as the dildo filled her belly to the point that she was sure she would burst. The doctor gave a few final shoves to the base of the dildo, and the device was crammed home. Victoria gasped as the dildo was at last pressed all the way into her. The deed was done. &#8216;How long do I need to hold this inside of me?&#8217; she wondered. But before she could complete the though, the second doctor stepped front and center. In her hands was a massive rubber device, a mystery to Victoria. It was shaped like a wine plug, only far larger and made completely out of rubber. The device had one big, bulbous end, which was incredibly thick at it&#8217;s widest point. It had to have at least five inches of circumference there, but the base of the device was far skinnier; perhaps only one inch around. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The two women stepped in close, the one holding the bulbous device in her hands circling around to Victoria&#8217;s rear. Before her, the other nurse grabbed hold of Victoria&#8217;s harness with one hand, while using the other to cup her tortured pussy. It was clear that with the hand in place, it would be impossible to press the malicious dildo out of her. The small woman tried her best to beg with her eyes, but the nurse would not look at her. Victoria even moaned through her gag, attempting to convey her pain and fear, but the women took no notice. Suddenly, there was a cold feeling against the plump cheeks of her behind. Victoria&#8217;s eyes shot open as the cool feeling travelled, pressing between her cheeks and seemingly digging for her anus. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Gaaah!� she cried out in extreme discomfort. She could feel the rubber device pressing uncomfortably against her rectum, slowly gaining territory. �Araaaugh!� she screamed, desperate for the pressing to stop and for the pain to cease. But the pressure only increased, and soon Victoria felt the two nurses each shoving against her. The one behind her held the anal torture device and tugged Victoria towards it. In front of her, the other nurse pushed the defenseless woman backwards as well, driving her against the head of the plug. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Victoria began to hyperventilate, straining against the corset that encased her body. Soon the plug began to slide deeper inside her anus, threatening to split her in two. If the devilish dildo in her pussy failed to destroy her psyche, then surely this gigantic butt plug would succeed. Tears poured down her cheeks, dripping and falling on her massive breasts below. It seemed that her control of her own body had been completely robbed of her, as her sobbing and drooling and choking escalated. With another push to the plug, it was driven into her at it&#8217;s widest point. The pure shock of it&#8217;s increasing presence stole her voice, and even her cries ceased for the moment. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The plug filled her insides so completely that she was sure it would crush her organs and perhaps even kill her. But as the plug slid farther into her, the thickest point was passed. Victoria moaned in relief as her anus was allowed to slowly close around the massive head of the plug. She groaned in discomfort as the bulbous end now filled her bowels, but she was glad that at least her anus was not stretched open any longer. Finally, the base of the plug could be felt resting between her butt cheeks. She&#8217;d done it. Somehow she had managed to take that massive thing into her virgin butt hole, very much to her own surprise. The outward pressure from the massive dildo and plug worked with the inward pressure of the intricate body harness and corset to leave Victoria in a constant state of extreme discomfort. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The tears continued to flow, but her mind had gone blank. All that she could do was hang helplessly and endure the unending pain to all parts of her body. She barely even flinched as another piece of the body harness, a long, wide strap was drawn from the front of the corset to the rear. The strap was thick, and riddled with even more tiny barbs, digging into her flesh from her naval and downwards all the way over her pussy and between her plump butt cheeks. Victoria murmured as the strap was pulled tight, the pressure increasing against her pussy and butthole, both painfully full and tormented by the barbs. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Victoria dangled helplessly, surrounded by her tormenters and completely unable to defend herself or even speak to them. Surely they were nearly done, though, she was sure. The warms tears dripped down her cheeks and fell upon her breasts, but the doctors didn&#8217;t even acknowledge her depression. Her eyes gazed upward, accepting that there was nothing she could possibly do to stop this process. The small brunette woman&#8217;s thoughts were affirmed when the female doctors closed in again, each holding even more torment devices. Each held a tall, wide glass tube, which was closed on one side and open wide on the other. Each was adorned with a large rubber ring near it&#8217;s open mouth, the purpose of them uncertain. A long clear tube extended from the closed end, and extended all the way over to a big blocky looking machine. &#8216;Oh God, what are those for?&#8217; she wondered, with a furrowed brow as they stepped in closer.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her curiosity vanished as each woman approached her front, and each placed their glass tube over her each of her ample breasts. �Aaargh!� Victoria moaned, as the women tugged as her breasts to fit them inside, but they could only get them so far. She didn&#8217;t like being molested so roughly, and she was tired of this treatment. The man then stood from his chair and with a long stride he made his way over to the blocky machine against the far wall. He raised his hand to a button on the front face of the machine, and turned to watch Victoria just before pressing it down. Immediately, the machine began to make a whirring sound, and a sucking noise could be heard coming from the massive glass domes that encircled her massive bosoms. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Urrrrgh� she moaned, as the glass sucked harder and her breasts were pulled in deeper. The glass tubes began to engulf her teats, and sank deeper toward her chest. Victoria sobbed as her boobs were sucked painfully, and the blood flowed and stayed within them. She could barely see below her but she could feel them expanding, and feeling as though they were being pulled in all directions at once. For several seconds the man allowed the machine to pump her breasts, until they were big and pink and engorged with blood. Finally though, he ended the torment and the suction ceased. The blood flowing into her breasts tantalized her, increasing her arousal. She couldn&#8217;t believe that such a disgusting treatment would cause her to feel so wet and horny. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tears continued to drip and fall from her chin, only to fall now on the tall glass domes fastened to her chest. The two female doctors closed in once again, and Victoria knew that more pain would follow. &#8216;How can this be any worse?!&#8217; she asked herself. &#8216;How much more could they do to torture me?!&#8217; In no time at all, her questions were answered. Each nurse brought their hands to one of the two glass tubes, and reached for the thick rubber rings that encircled them near their bases. They pushed the rubber rings down, toward the open mouth of the tubes and towards Victoria&#8217;s chest. As the wide O-rings came free from the glass tubes, they shrank exponentially around the base of her pumped tits. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Aaaaargh!!� she cried out, in incredible, blinding pain. The rings closed in around her breasts at their very base, trapping all of the blood within them inside and forcing them to bulge into a pair of massive, rosey orbs. Victoria cried out in unbelievable agony as the two women then pried the glass tubes free from her chest, leaving her boobs as two big balls of tortured flesh. Her breathing was heavy and ragged, and Victoria tried her best to catch her breath. It seemed impossible, as the latex suit and the leather body harness compressed her chest and lungs. Victoria cried freely as she was forced to accept her fate. There was nothing she could do but wait patiently for the next device, and pray for the mercy that she was sure would never come. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The nurses turned and stepped back once again, only to return with more gadgets to increase her misery. Each women produced a tool that looked like a tiny black cage, ball shaped and with a narrow opening on one end and a wide one on the other. They were rigid, likely made of metal but covered in a rubberized coating. The cages opened on a hinge like a book, and on the inside surface Victoria spotted even more tiny barbs. Victoria wailed in protest, spittle dripping from her gaping jaws as the women simultaneously opened the black cages and closed them around her engorged breasts. The barbs bit harshly into the flesh of her tender, tortured tits, as the cages tried to accommodate them. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Huuuurngg!� she groaned out loudly, as the cages came closed about her big,&nbsp; reddening breasts. &#8216;How in God&#8217;s name�&#8217; she thought, but her ability to think was dulled. All she was aware of was the immense pain being inflected to every part of her body. The fear of what was to come, and the disbelief of the augmentations made to her body had disappeared for the moment. For now, her only companion was pain. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cages only increased the stress against her bulging breasts, forcing them to squeeze through the seems between the rungs of the cages. She&#8217;d never imagined this kind of pain, her breasts&nbsp; filled with blood and being stabbed by a hundred tiny barbs. The tiny prongs were beyond painful, but they were apparently not so sharp that they could break the skin and draw blood. Victoria watched through her blurring tears as the women approached once more, each carrying yet more devices. &#8216;How?&#8217; she wondered.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first nurse stepped in with a pair of tiny glass tubes, essentially smaller versions of what had been used on her gigantic breasts. She moaned in distress as they were directed once more to her aching boobs. Her eyes bulged as she felt the smaller tubes being pressed against her nipples, where they were exposed on the front of the cages. Victoria grunted, spit flying from her gaping mouth as the tubular suction cups surrounded her tender nips. The nurse produced a small hand pump, and one after the other siphoned her big, red nipples until the glass tubes were seemingly cemented to her breast. The suction drew her blood into her sensitive flesh, titillating her even more. &#8216;Oh God, how can this be turning me on?&#8217; she wondered. She knew it was against her own will, but her body&#8217;s betrayal was revolting. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With the small suction devices attached to her gruesomely overindulged nips, the pump was removed. One nurse turned and walked back to the work bench, while the other placed small rings over each of the nipple stimulators. The rings attached to the rings at the base of her nipples, and twist-locked into place. Victoria did her best to get a hold of herself, unable to fathom how she could be so aroused by such vile treatment. A mixture of tears and drool flowed from her face, dropping and splashing down on her massive and grotesque breasts. Her moans through the ring gag went unacknowledged, her discomfort completely disregarded. One of the nurses approached yet again, holding a third glass suction cup similar to the first two. With this one however, she dropped down to her knees and out of Victoria&#8217;s field of view. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suddenly, she felt a familiar sucking against her most sensitive area as the woman crunched the hand pump a dozen times. �Aaaaiieee!� Victoria squealed as her clit filled with blood that could not escape. She couldn&#8217;t see it but she knew what had happened, the woman had pumped her little clitoris just the same way she had her nipples. A small circular hole on the front of the crotch strap left her most receptive sexual organ. The nurse pulled the pump free and stepped away, allowing the other to step in for the moment. Another ring was dropped in over the glass tube, and twisted into place at it&#8217;s base, further locking the suction cup in it&#8217;s position. Both nurses finally stepped back, making room for the man to step in and inspect.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Victoria tried her best to avoid eye contact, afraid of what could happen to her if she met his gaze directly. The man&#8217;s hands rose and touched her, feeling over the latex body suit and the leather harness that covered her. She was small before all this, but she felt much smaller now. Her entire body cringed in extreme agony as he felt around, pressing on the leather at different places. Each time, the barbs within dug even deeper into her skin, forcing her to wince and whine. A tight lipped smirk appeared on his lips every time she showed the pain she was in, but try as she might she couldn&#8217;t contain it. One of the man&#8217;s hands drifted down low to her crotch, rubbing roughly into the wide strap that held the dildo and plug inside her. His other hand lifted and toyed with her left breast; big, round, and purple, and tortured and stimulated. How her boobs could even handle such torment was baffling. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Victoria looked away as the man played with her body, trying her best to ignore his twisted smile. He kneaded her tits as best as he could with the metal cages about them, and flicked the suction glasses stimulating her nipples so immensely. He ground her hand into the base of the crotch strap, causing the dildo within her to move only a tiny bit. But as he did it so long, her hips began to gyrate and her breathing became ragged and whispery again. The doctor stepped around behind her, pulling her delicate frame in close to himself. With both hands he toyed with her abused tits, while the women continued to toy with the stimulator about her clit. Despite her disagreement, her body was aroused to no end, and she knew she was dangerously close to orgasm. Suddenly, the man cut and an end to the whole ordeal and the three of them stepped off, leaving Victoria impossibly turned on and with no means to reach climax. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That&#8217;ll do� the man said. �Put her back in the chair, strap her down nice� he commanded, �Prepare it&#8217;s head.� Victoria&#8217;s brow furrowed at the man&#8217;s mention of her, referring to her as an �it�. The two women doctors moved expeditiously, each to different ends of the room. Victoria&#8217;s eyes tossed from one way to the other, trying to track their movements. One moved to one side of the room and hovered her hand over the controls to the chain she dangled from. The other departed to the other side of the padded table and took control of the modified wheelchair she&#8217;d been brought in on. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8216;Oh no, they&#8217;re going to move me again&#8217; she thought. &#8216;Where would they bring me? What&#8217;s going to happen to me next?&#8217; The man exited the room through the curtain flaps and Victoria was suddenly left alone with the two females. �Aaauugh!� she bantered, desperate to beg for mercy. But there would be none, and Victoria felt herself slowly lowered into the bowl shaped base of the chair, finally coming to a rest on the nubs of her legs. Victoria panted in fear as the women untangled her hair from the claw in which it was entwined, finally allowing it to cascade down her back and sides once more. Her hair was much longer than it had been before, now reaching all the way to her butt. &#8216;How long could I have been asleep?&#8217; she wondered. &#8216;I� can&#8217;t remember anything after the bar.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Victoria sat up as tall as she could manage, as one of the nurses ran a brush through her unbelievably long hair. For several minutes she brushed it out, working out every knot and tangle until it was all perfectly straight and shining. It felt oddly pleasing to have her hair brushed, soothing her mind despite all of the pain and torment she&#8217;d only just endured. She didn&#8217;t even notice that she&#8217;d closed her eyes until the brushing ceased, and she felt a pair of hands fiddle with the buckle about the nape of her head. Victoria&#8217;s eyes slowly opened, to see the bespectacled face of the women staring directly at her. Her arms were loosely wrapped around her, unbuckling the ring gag from her neck. Finally, the straps dangled freely and the woman pulled the ring free from Victoria&#8217;s gaping jaw. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Pweave!� she cried out immediately. She knew that her chances were slim, but she had to at least try to speak to her tormenters. Her first attempt at speech proved futile, her words barely intelligible. The diamond formation of piercings in her tongue made it practically useless when attempting to enunciate, and the result was embarrassing. �Pweave, whiffen!� she begged, but the woman didn&#8217;t even give her a second glance. �Pweave, ummer-famd! I Ohn bewong hew!� she tried desperately to explain to her captors. Suddenly a pair of hands draped over her shoulders from behind her, holding another device which caused Victoria&#8217;s eyes to widen in fear.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mo! Mot fat!� she cried, tears running down her cheeks. But the massive purple dong was brought closer and closer to her lips, the bulbous head coming in first. As it closed in, Victoria noted a small hole drilled into the head of the fake cock and another halfway down to the base. Despite her attempt to turn away, the head of the gigantic dildo was soon pressed against her trembling pink lips. �Pweave!� she wailed one last time, before the massive purple dildo was forced between her teeth. �Haarghmmmph!� Victoria grunted and gargled as the faux penis was shoved unrelentingly down into her gullet. Her eyes bulged as she tried her best to accept the new inhabitant of her throat, as it pushed from the inside out. Victoria&#8217;s throat wanted to bulge outward with the presence of the gigantic cock, but the tall leather collar about her throat disallowed it. The small woman went crosseyed watching as the purple dildo disappeared within her one terrible inch at a time. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Little by little, the purple phallus escaped her view and her throat became fuller and fuller. With each twist and shoved of the end of the penis-gag, Victoria released a pathetic whine. Tears continued to flow as her throat was fucked by the gigantic dildo, which had to be some eight inches in length. Her lips encircled the dildo completely, despite it&#8217;s incredible girth. The fake cock had to be at least two inches in diameter, and Victoria was perplexed that she was somehow managing to take it so far. Finally, the purple cock disappeared within her completely, and the woman lifted a pair of straps from it&#8217;s base and buckled them behind her neck. Just as the ring had been, the dildo was locked firmly in place and would not be removable unless with the help of another person. With her lips sealed tightly around the spherical base of the gag, she felt the drool pooling up in her jaw once again. Almost as if it were instinct, Victoria began to massage the base of the dildo with her studded tongue. Only once she realized what she was doing did her revolting action stop. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Strangely Victoria found that despite the presence of the dildo blocking her entire throat, she was perfectly capable of breathing, though only through her nose. She was confused as to how this was possible, but surmised that the wholes in the dildo worked as an internal snorkel of sorts. She could pass air from her nostrils, through the dildo, and on to her lungs and back. The helpless woman moaned at the realization that this essentially made it unnecessary to remove the gag at all, meaning it could possibly be left in until she had to eat or drink. Victoria trembled&nbsp; at the idea of having the dildo stuck in place for very long, especially with the other two protrusions in her vagina and anus. It seemed that she existed now only to have her sexuality tortured to the extreme, in ways that only the sickest mind to dream.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Victoria sat upright and didn&#8217;t defy the woman as she tightly buckled a much shorter strap under her chin, forcing her to bit down hard on the base of the gag. Another pair of straps, connected to the neck straps a few inches from the gag dangled freely before her face, their purpose not yet clear. With the gag very effectively in place, the second nurse approached from behind and began to gather all of Victoria&#8217;s long, gorgeous brown hair into a single ponytail. She worked with her gloved hands as well as the brush, ensuring that not a single strand of hair escaped. The woman then pulled the ponytail up high to the crown of Victoria&#8217;s head before binding it into a single high ponytail. Her hair felt almost uncomfortably tight against her scalp, stretched perhaps just a little too far.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The additional pair of straps were then pulled up from the neck strap, and up to the ponytail upon her crown. The straps came together and were buckled tightly, with a small opening allowing the ponytail to be pulled through. It seemed now that the strap and the ponytail would work together to keep each other in place. The nurse behind the chair then gathered up Victoria&#8217;s ponytails and lifted it vertically. For a moment, she was worried that she would be suspended by her hair once again, but watched from below as a small donut shaped accessory was dropped over the end of the tail. Victoria knew immediately what it was for, and watched contently as the woman began to pull her hair through the donut and roll the donut downwards. As the donut rolled down, the girl&#8217;s beautiful brown hair was spun into a marvelous sock-bun. Victoria waited as the woman completed the task, and felt her work an elastic hair tie around the base of the bun, trapping all of the loose hairs. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The nurse then produced a small tiara, and placed it upon Victoria&#8217;s head just before the massive bun. Victoria felt ashamed and afraid, wondering why these people would do all of this to her. She could do nothing more than sit and wait for the next terrible thing to happen to her, and try her best to endure the constant pain and humiliation. The tears had seemed to stop when the female doctors wheeled Victoria around and brought her toward the tall mirror. She looked upon herself, and the tears began to flow once more. What she saw was not herself, but some grotesque toy girl that had been mutilated and destroyed. Her mind was still present, but the body she saw was not her own.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her once curvy body was much skinnier now, and even more so with the corset and harness in place. While she&#8217;d always been a very busty girl, she never imagined that her boobs would be the size or condition they were now. They were massive and round, bulging around&nbsp; the bars of the cages that encircled them. The glass casings ensnaring her nipples as well as her clitoris added disgusting insult to the whole ordeal, keeping her forcibly aroused and yearning for orgasm. Hidden from view, but very much present to her, the humongous dildo and plug inside her stretched her insides, and contributed to her sexual exploitation. She moaned around the gag, and watched helplessly as spittle dripped from her pink lips. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Victoria didn&#8217;t like what she saw. The &#8216;makeup&#8217; that had been applied earlier appeared to be more of a paint than anything, seemingly staining her skin to appear made up like a she was ready for a night on the town. Her eye shadow was a dark purple, matching with the latex bodybag and the gag between her lips, and her cheeks were flushed a bright pinkish red. The big bug atop her head was neatly done, and the tiny tiara in front of it complimented it very well with it&#8217;s purple tinted gemstones. Victoria cried and, watched in the mirror as the two doctors turned and walked for the exit. Both left without even turning back, leaving Victoria completely alone to stare at her horrendously modified body.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8216;Oh God&#8217; she thought to herself. &#8216;What&#8217;s going to happen to me?&#8217;
