����������� She�d been
kneeling naked, eyes closed, for what seemed like an eternity.� Most likely it was only 15 minutes but the
time of silence, without his words, his touch or the sight of him to anchor her
made it feel much longer, much worse.�
Despite knowing there would be an end to it she couldn�t get used to
these moments of enforced silence, enforced exile.� Her arousal would dissipate quickly without
him even though she knew it pleased him greatly to keep her this way.� He�d always feel her, check to see if she�d
managed to stay wet for him.� She�d
gotten used to the fact that he never seemed to mind either way,
that her responses, no matter what, were what pleased him because they
were responses based on her submission.�
That, she knew, pleased him the most.

&nbsp;

����������� Lately he
seemed to understand more deeply how much she needed this with him.� Being allowed to express this part of herself was blissful in and of itself but there was
something about him that made it all the more so.� His patience, his pacing�no, she shook her
head.� She loved him.� She�d gone deeper into submission because she
loved and trusted him.� Trusted that she
could go there and he�d understand.� That
he�d want her there.

&nbsp;

����������� Smiling and
nodding to herself she focused her thoughts on him.�� She knew he was also expressing himself in a
way that he�d only fantasized before.�
They fit.� She felt a warm flush
thru her entire body, warmth across the curve of her bottom, warmth perking up
her nipples, infusing her with wetness.�
A little shudder rippled thru her when she thought about how he�d want
her to express that to him.� He�d want
her to say, �ass� and �tits� and �pussy� or �cunt��and
she blushed even thinking the words.� She
could say them in general, but when it came to intimate times alone with him
she felt so exposed in so many ways and so she always struggled with it.� He�d insist.�
She�d blush more.� It would
spiral.� She knelt there swaying gently
thinking of the things they�d gotten into over language�She smiled to herself
in her own darkness again, a sultry needy smile as she recalled the time he�d
called her a �hot little bitch� after forcing her to pinch her nipples in the
middle of the crowded mall�called her that and then crushed his lips against
hers so violently that she felt as if he were extracting her soul.

&nbsp;

����������� He sat
watching her, entranced, wondering what she could possibly be thinking.� He wished he could have access to each and
every fleeting thought and sensation inside her head.� She fascinated him.� She�d managed to bring out his darkest,
cruelest most violent side yet between them it was all�love.� Pure.� He considered ordering her to tell him what
was on her mind but decided against it.�
This was by far the best reaction he�d ever gotten from her when he�d
had her like this and he didn�t want to waste it.

&nbsp;

����������� He knelt
facing her.� He watched the slow sensuous
shiver ripple thru her body as she sensed his closeness.� She leaned forward ever so slightly and his
cock strained as he watched her struggle to keep her eyelids closed.� Her lips parted.� She wet them with her tongue.� She did her best to stay quiet, biting her
lower lip to suppress a whimper of need.�
�������� 

����������� He leaned
closer to her ear and whispered, �Still pet.�
Stay very still.�� She shivered
with need but kept herself under control for him.� He licked the shell of her ear, teasing
her.� She wondered if he understood in
that moment all her sexual energy, all her need, was focused on the place being
touched by his tongue.� She thought she
would cum from the intensity.� He pulled
back smiling.� He�d felt her ear grow hot
under his tongue.� It was bright
red.� He decided to push this a little.� Bending close he said it again, �Quiet and
still my pet, only quiet and still for me.��


&nbsp;

����������� He went to
the kitchen and grabbed a chair.� Before
returning to where she knelt he undressed.�
She smiled when she heard his zipper.�
Her heart and clit throbbed in unison.�
She adored his cock.

&nbsp;

����������� He placed
the chair along her left side and sat facing her reddened ear.

Gently, he pushed her hair out of the way, combing it with
his fingers, almost petting her with his touch��
He noted the heaving of her chest and the red flush spreading
there.� He traced along her ear with his
fingertip, gently, barely touching.�
�It�s like your whole body is a cunt for me to play with, slut,� He said
almost to himself as he grabbed his cock and traced it along her ear, right
where he�d just kissed her.� �A cunt
ear�god your ear is so fucking hot right now!��
A pleading little moan escaped her soft lips.� He pulled his hand away immediately, grabbed
a handful of hair and yanked her head back. She scrunched her eyes tighter
knowing she�d made a mistake.� �I told
you to be quiet. Was that quiet?�

&nbsp;

����������� He released
her hair.� Stroking the back of her neck,
he petted her until he sensed her relaxing into him once again.� It was a rush for him, this simple act of
petting her and seeing how visibly it calmed her.� She is my pet he thought, feeling the swell
in his heart and cock all at the same time.�
He leaned down and kissed the top of her head and brought his fingers to
her lips.� He knew she�d be dying to suck
on them, but he simply traced, lightly, across her lips, outlining them.� He grinned, knowing how this affected her,
knowing that her lips were highly sensitive.�
When he�d first realized this he�d spent and evening with her tied as he
teased her lips with soft strokes from a feather, with ice and even with a few
stinging slaps followed by luscious kissing.�
Her nipples had gotten so hard, he�d felt the need to bite them, to hurt
her there. It was that night that he�d attached the clamps he�d purchased but
had been hesitant to introduce.� He
looked at her now, saw how engorged her nipples were again, and brushed his
hand across them.� �Maybe you need the
clamps tonight, pet?� He said, surprised at how husky
his own voice sounded.� Again a shimmer
of heat passed through her.� He could see
it despite her struggle to obey his order to be still and quiet.� She was simply on fire for him tonight. �Stay
there girl.�� He petted her hair again
before leaving her there once more.

&nbsp;

She heard him bounding up the stairs.� She could tell he was taking them his usual
two at a time.� She allowed herself a
deep noisy exhale.� She�d been almost
holding her breath to stay still for him.�
She wanted to press her hand to her inflamed ear, wanted to soothe it,
but she didn�t dare.� It wasn�t that she
feared him, just that she didn�t want to disrespect
the depth of their bond.� She didn�t want
to jeopardize that.� She didn�t want to
disrespect him either.� She felt herself
getting wetter.� She knew that her inner
thighs were smeared and sticky.� She
heard him descending the stairs.� She
gave in to one more little shudder before holding the word �still� in her mind
like a mantra.

&nbsp;

Without speaking he knelt behind her and fastened the
leather cuff around her right wrist.� He
knew she usually liked him to speak to her when he was binding her but tonight
he wanted to continue to leave her in as much silence as possible.� He didn�t even reassure her with a kiss on
the head.� He saw that she was still
flushed for him.� He could smell her
arousal, thick and heady and he had to fight his desire to throw her down and
stab his tongue into her wet, needy, hole.�
He quickly cuffed her left wrist and clasped them together with a spring
clip.� He got up and stepped in front of
her and once again was enthralled by the rapturous smile that greeted him.� 

&nbsp;

She thought about that little spring clip rendering her
arms, her hands, useless behind her back.�
She felt almost calm knowing that she couldn�t fight him away now.� It made her feel more, owned.� She wanted to feel owned.� She wanted to be owned.� By him.� Forever.�� She thought she would ask him for permission
to wear one of those spring clips on her key ring.� A symbol to remind her that she was always his, that he was always with her.� 

&nbsp;

He just wanted to just gaze at her like this, vulnerable,
open and so completely turned on but he couldn�t bring himself to not touch
her.� His fingertips moved across her
nipples once more, softly, before he grasped her more firmly as if weighing her
breasts.� He saw her lips part so that
she could wet them with her tongue.� He
liked her mouth open.� He pinched her
nipples hard and didn�t stop even after her mouth was open wide for him.� He enjoyed her little useless, silent
struggle.� He shoved his cock in her
mouth, thrusting deep, using her there but he got impatient with that.� He didn�t want that tonight.� He didn�t want the gagging and the
sucking.� Not that he
didn�t like that.� He�d trained
her to hold her breath longer and longer so that she could keep the head of his
cock in the small of her throat where it blocked any airflow.� When he allowed her to relax and take a
breath he could feel a little spasm in her throat muscles, and intense massage
feeling.� It always brought him to the
brink.� But tonight He wanted to be
inside her.� Snug and warm.� He belonged there.� The velvety wetness all
his.� His
property.� To
use.� 

&nbsp;

He ripped his cock from her hungry lips, got behind her and
pressed her forward, head down, ass up. She let out a small gasp.� He knew she hated this position, hated that
he could see her both holes.� He also
knew that being in this position made her wetter.� He slid a finger up her engorged slit,
pressing slightly against her asshole.�
She thrust herself forward before she caught herself.� �I�m so sorry!�� He could hear the mortification in her voice.� He decided to be merciful and he stroked her
back.� �It�s okay pet, now shhh��
he stroked her lower, and gave her a few light spanks.� It�s okay, here�s a little spanking for you,
now relax for Me because I�m going to fuck you
now.�� She could feel the spanks getting
a little more intense as he waited for her body to relax.� She loved the spanks.� That was her favorite way to receive
affection from him.� She also knew just
how hard spanking her made his cock.� She
couldn�t take it anymore.� �Please!� I, oh !� just fuck me,
please!�� He grasped onto her bound hands
and used them for leverage.� He slipped
the head of his cock against her wet slit and summoned up every last bit of his
self control.� Staying very still he
commanded thru clenched teeth, �you fuck Me,
slut!�� She moaned an unintelligible
stream of vowels and consonants before pushing her hips back wildly, doing
anything she could to impale herself on his cock.� Urgency informed her gyrations.� She almost feared that he�d change his mind
and not want to fuck her.� Right now, all
she needed, her sole focus, was on having his cock deep inside her.� She felt him digging his fingers into the
softness of her ass and hips, urging her to fuck him harder and faster and
fought her need to keep him buried deep in her aching cunt.� She lurched her
whole body back and forth, grinding herself against his cock, working for him,
sweating and hoping that she was pleasing him.�
He reached forward and grabbed her hair once again and told her to stay
still.� He pulled hard when she didn�t
immediately obey.� She cried out and
stopped.� Slowly, he began to move his hips, sensually fucking her in a way that he knew melted
her.� He loved her.� He wanted to melt her completely so he spoke
to her, finally,� �That�s
it baby, that�s right, just stay still now and let me fuck you.��� He heard a sweet little moan escape her lips
before some deeper sounds came from her�at first he thought it was just more
groaning but he realized that she was almost chanting, over and over, �thank
you thank you thank you!� Over and over she thanked him as he fucked her,
pulling on her hair to now and then to remind her to stay still while he was
using her.� �I love you baby.� He
whispered before telling her to cum for him.�
She just moved her hips into him, to get his cock deeper, and he knew it
wasn�t a physical need, he knew that she needed him deep just because she
needed to be close to him.� Her moans of
thanks changed to, �love you love you love you� as she gave herself over to the
orgasm crashing thru her.� She�d never
given herself so utterly and completely to him before.� He pushed his hips forward to embed himself
even deeper as he rode the spasms of her body to his own orgasm.� 

&nbsp;

Panting, shaky and misty eyed he rushed to undo her cuffs so
that he could cuddle her to him.� He
kissed her with tiny kisses all over her face as he gathered her up in his arms
and carried her up the stairs.� She
lolled in his arms, spent emotionally and physically, happy to be carried by
her owner, her love.� He placed her on
their bed and tucked himself next to her giving her another deep, possessive
kiss before telling her it was time to sleep.�
Content, she placed her ear, the one he�d teased earlier, on his chest,
right over his heartbeat, and once again closed her eyes for him.�����
