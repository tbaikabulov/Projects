Tom and Jill

&nbsp;

Chapter one � The wrong
place at the wrong time.

&nbsp;

Tom looked at the head of the person in
front of him as he stood in the bank line.�
Making certain that he was not fidgeting or making himself stand out in
anyway, he saw the women in front say good-bye to the teller.� He knew that his brother has just reached the
counter of the teller beside him and that their timing would be perfect.� The young girl behind the counter said hello
and asked how she could help him today. She was pretty, with big blues eyes and
long blonde hair.� She also had a lovely
smile, which he knew he would not see again once he had told her what she could
do for him.� Leaning close so that he could
speak in a soft voice, he pushed a piece of paper across the counter for the
young girl to read.� Her face grew pale
as she read his message and he could her eyes widen in fear. 

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry, I
don�t want to hurt you.� Just put the
money in this bag and I will be gone before you know it.� Make a fuss or set of the alarm and I can�t
guarantee what will happen.� See the man
at the next counter, he is my partner and you really don�t want to upset
him.�� As he spoke, he could see the girl
consider what to do, finally taking the bag he had put on the counter and
putting the money from her till into it.

&nbsp;

�I don�t want any marked money either
Clare.� You wouldn�t like it if I had to
come back sometime, maybe when you are at home.� He had no idea where she lived
but he had come to realise that during times of stress, a victim does not think
logically.� To her mind right now, she
would believe that he could do just that.

&nbsp;

�No, sir, I will only put real money
in.� I don�t want to cause any trouble.�

&nbsp;

�Good girl, you are really doing very
well.� I will be gone very soon and you
will never have to see me again.� He smiled at her, seeing her relax at his
words, knowing for certain that she did think that he could find her.� 

&nbsp;

At the next counter Nick was also watching
a young teller named Mary fill his bag with
money.� He and his brother had done this
many times and had never had any problems so far.� They had found that if they could choose a
line with a young girl serving, then she would usually be too scared to do
anything silly.� He could usually tell by
their eyes when they were thinking of setting of an alarm and the look on their
face when he warned them not do it was priceless. The young teller in front of
him was a pretty young thing, properly no older than twenty and with short dark
hair.� Her hands were shaking slightly as
she did up the zip on the bag and slid it across the counter.� He could see that Tom was also about ready go
and it was time to do the last thing.

&nbsp;

�Mary, you have been very helpful. Now I
don�t want you to say anything to anyone for at least thirty minutes.� Remember, I will know by the news tonight
what time you have told people and if I think you have disobeyed me, than you
can expect a visit late one night.� You
really don�t want that, do you Mary?�� 

&nbsp;

The girl shook her head, tears beginning to
form in the corner of her eyes.� Nick
thanked her in a normal voice for her help and wished her a good day before
walking out of the bank, his brother a few steps behind him.� They did not talk to each other until they
were three blocks away, where they removed their wigs, hats and
sunglasses.� He was not surprised to hear
no sirens or alarms, as they had learnt that by threatening the girl with a
home visit, she became more concerned about that then about the bank loosing
some money.� They were just about to walk
across the road to their car when they noticed the police car drive slowly by,
checking out the car.� 

&nbsp;

�Fuck, it looks like we will have to find
some other means of transport.� Nick hissed.�

Tom had seen the police cruiser too.�
�Maybe they will keep going.� Before he had even finished his sentence,
the cruiser had stopped, one of the police stepping out.� They had stolen the car the night before
three towns away, as they usually did before each robbery.� They would then use the car to get away and
dump it somewhere.� They never left any
personal items in the car, so were not worried about being linked with the
car.� However, they now had the problem
of finding another car before the thirty minutes were up.

&nbsp;

�Come on, there is a supermarket car park
just down the road and I am sure we can find someone to drive us to the old
house.� Tom led the way to the car park, taking care to not run, though he felt
like it.� He looked around and saw the
cars, trying to find an average looking one.�
He was just about to point one out to Nick, when his brother tapped him
on the shoulder.

&nbsp;

�Hey look. This could just be our lucky
day.� 

&nbsp;

Tom looked at the direction of his
brother�s finger and saw a young woman pushing her trolley across the park,
obviously heading to her car.��� 

&nbsp;

�Hey come on, wouldn�t it be easier to just
take a car.�

&nbsp;

Nick looked at his younger brother,
thinking that though they worked together very well, they certainly were
different in many ways. 

&nbsp;

�No, Tom, we don�t have the time to fuck
around trying to find a car and hope we won�t set any alarms of. This is our
best bet.� She is alone and about ready
to go.� He saw her reach her car, pleased that it was not too flashy. �Plus,
look at her car, it is just like what we would have
wanted anyway. Come on, I�ll grab her and you keep watch.�� 

&nbsp;

Before Tom had time to argue, his brother
was gone.� He knew that he was right,
this was the best option, but he still didn�t really like it.� However, for now he moved to keep watch, his
hand on his gun in case he needed it.�
Tom walked calmly up to the woman who was busy loading her bags into the
bag of the car. She had a nice figure, with average sized breasts and a firm
bottom.� Her long, reddish hair was tied
back, showing a lovely face. He noted that she was down to the last bag and
again thought that they certainly had some luck on their side today.� 

&nbsp;

Jill only became aware of the man standing
near her as he spoke. She jumped and almost dropped the bag in her hand.� 

&nbsp;

�So sorry to bother you Miss, but I am lost
and I was wondering if you know where Smith St
is?� I have been driving around with my
wife for the last half hour and she finally made me stop and ask someone.�� He saw her smile, relaxing as she considered
him safe now that she thought he had a wife somewhere.� 

&nbsp;

�Oh, I�m sorry. I am a visitor here
too.� I only know how to get back to my
friend�s house. I guess you will have to ask someone in the store.�� She had placed the last bag in the back of
the car and shut the door, when he grabbed her around the throat, his other arm
covering her mouth.� 

&nbsp;

�Now, you are going to help me. I need
someone to drive my brother and me and you are the
lucky one.� When I take my hand away, I
don�t want to hear a sound or I will kill you and take the car anyway.��� He could feel her shallow breathes as he
blocked the air from her throat.� He
could also feel her body shaking and felt his cock twitching in response.� 

&nbsp;

�Nod your head if you are going to
behave.�� He felt her try to nod and
carefully started to remove his hand.�
When she made no attempt at yelling or speaking he removed if fully,
turning her to face him as he also took his arm from around her throat.� 

&nbsp;

Jill struggled to get her breath back. She
was aware of another man approaching them, briefly hoping that it was someone who
could help her. These hopes were dashed when she remembered he had mentioned a
brother.� 

&nbsp;

�Now love, you are going to get into the
car and drive us where we say. If you behave and do just as you are asked, then
you will be ok.� Will you do that?�� 

&nbsp;

Jill nodded, not sure that her voice would
work, even if she tried.� She felt the
man lead her to the driver�s seat, the brother sitting in the back seat at the
same time.� This put aside any thoughts
of just driving away before the men could get into the car.� Once she was seated, the first man quickly
ran to the other door and also entered the car.�


&nbsp;

�Now, turn right when you leave the car
park and continue up the road until I say.�
There is a police cruiser around and I warn you now that if you even
think of getting their attention, things would not be so friendly
anymore.�� 

&nbsp;

Jill glanced briefly at the man, sensing
that he was serious.� She started the car
and drove in the direction she had been told.�
She didn�t know the area, her friend�s house in the other
direction.� When they got to one of the
intersections, she became aware of the police car in the lane beside her.� She felt a firm grip on her knee and looked
down to see the man�s hand on her leg.� 

&nbsp;

�Stay calm now, just keep
you eyes on the road and everything will be fine.�� She could see him flash his gun as he spoke
and had to grip the steering wheel tightly to remain calm.� She glanced in the mirror to see the man in the
back seat looking at her anxiously.� She
had not heard him say anything but he seemed to be willing to follow whatever
his brother said.� It was only when she
felt the hand ease it�s grip on her leg that she realised the police car had
turned the corner, and the light was green for her to go forward.� 

&nbsp;

�Well done, that could have nasty.� If you continue to behave, we might all get
home in one piece.��� Jill noticed that
he had not removed his hand and over the next few hours he kept it there,
running his hand up and down her thigh as she drove.� Eventually she was told to turn into a dirt
road and after another forty minutes she saw an old house.

Chapter two � The escape

&nbsp;

�Drive around the back and pull into the
garage there.� Don�t move until you are
told.� She drove around the back and parked the car in an old garage filled
with rusty farm implements and old boxes.�
She could feel her heart beating faster as she waited to be allowed to
leave the car.� All the time she was
driving she knew she was necessary to their plans but now they were at their
final destination, she began to worry that they would not need her around any
more. When the door was opened, she jumped, her mind
on other things.� She could see it was
the younger brother who had his hand out for her to take.� 

&nbsp;

�Come on love, I know you are scared but
you can�t stay in the car all day.� I
don�t know about you but I am feeling rather hungry.�� At his words, she looked up, seeing something
like concern on his face. She tentatively put her hand in his, surprised at
this touch of manners in such a strange situation.� 

&nbsp;

Tom sensed her hesitation, not surprising
due to her situation.� He had watched her
while she had driven, seeing the fear she tried to keep hidden, in her eyes. He
knew she had to be wondering what would happen now, and he had to admit that he
didn�t even now the answer to that one himself.�
They had never had a reason to have a hostage before and he didn�t know
what Nick had in mind.� He helped her to
stand and led her to the back of the car, stopping her there before he took her
into the house.� 

&nbsp;

Jill let herself be helped from the car and
was just beginning to think that he would not hurt her, when he turned her to
stop at the back of the car.� He had not
been rough, but she still sensed the strength he could use if needed.� Looking up at him, she tried to read in his face what his intention might be. 

&nbsp;

Tom could see that he had scared her by
stopping her so suddenly and cursed himself.�
He only wanted to reassure her that he would not harm her, but had
already made her scared of him.� 

&nbsp;

�What is your name, dear?�

&nbsp;

�J-Jill.�� He could hear the
nervousness in her voice and stepped back a little to give her some more
personal space, however he still held her hand in his.� 

&nbsp;

�Jill, I know you are scared and I am sure
I would be too if I were in your shoes.�
I just want to let you know that you have nothing to be scared of from
me.� However, you will need to be careful
around my brother.� He is not a bad man,
but you don�t want to make him mad.�� 

&nbsp;

He could see her eyes widen at his comment,
sorry that he had to scare her even more, but he knew that he had to warn her
about Nick.� 

&nbsp;

�What is going to happen to me? Will you
let me go?�� 

&nbsp;

�I really don�t know, we don�t usually take
hostages and I don�t know what my brother has in mind yet.� 

&nbsp;

�He
could see her taking in what he was saying, as her face grew pale.�� He had just let go of her hand to stroke her
face when she got away from him.� Before
he knew what was happening, she had grabbed an old pitchfork and was holding it
up in front of her.

&nbsp;

Jill didn�t know how she had done it, but
one minute he was telling her that he didn�t know what would happen to her and
the next she was holding the pitchfork.�
She had noticed it along with the other rusty tools as she drove in but
never thought she would have it in her hands so soon.� The look of shock on the man�s face would
have made her laugh in other circumstances. She had no idea what she would do
now, but thought that if she could get the keys she could take the car and
escape.� 

&nbsp;

Please, I don�t want to hurt you. Please
just give me the keys and I�ll go. I won�t even tell anyone about this.
Please.� She could see him considering what to do and thought she had won when
he moved his hand to his pocket.�
Unfortunately, she didn�t know he had a gun and instead of him getting
her keys, he levelled the gun at her.� 

&nbsp;

�Now Jill, I really don�t want to use this
but unless you put down the pitchfork, I will be forced to shoot you. I have
heard that even a simple graze can be very painful.�� Tom saw her freeze, not knowing what to do.� He didn�t want to shoot her but had hoped
that he could bluff her into putting down the fork. He knew that if Nick was
here, he would have used the gun already.�
He was just about to give her one more warning when he saw Nick come
running out of the house.

&nbsp;

�What the fuck is going on here?� Nick
yelled as he stormed down the yard. The sound of his voice startled Jill,
making her drop the fork and run.� She
had no idea where she was going and could hear footsteps behind her. Bracing
herself for the pain of a gunshot, she was not prepared for the feeling of her
feet being pulled out from under her in what had to be a perfect tackle. Her
breath knocked out of her by the fall, she could not stop him from flipping her
onto her back.� She hardly had time to
see his hand fly up before she felt a stinging blow to one side of her face.
Her other cheek received the same treatment before she felt her hands gathered
up together above her head.� She looked
up at the man through her tears, not liking the anger she could see in his
eyes.

&nbsp;

�What the fuck did you think you were
doing, bitch?� I had almost decided to
let you go but now you have pissed me off. That is not a good thing, believe
me.�� Jill felt the grip on her hands
tighten as he took both her wrists in one of his big hands. When he reached
inside his jacket, she was sure he was reaching for his gun. Closing her eyes,
she again braced herself for the anticipated pain, but a new pain in her wrists
forced her to open her eyes again.� When
she looked up, she could see he was tying her hands with a piece of rope,
firmly binding them together. She was then jerked to her feet, his hands
holding the end of the rope like a leash. 

&nbsp;

�That was a really stupid thing to do. We
will have to keep a good watch on you while we decide what to do with you. Kid,
you get her groceries out of the car.�� 

&nbsp;

Jill was pulled into the house, finding
herself having to run a bit to keep up with his big strides.� She watched his back as he pulled her along,
seeing the muscles working with each step.�
She felt foolish for having tried to get away, but at the time she was
going on instinct.� She had no time to
check out her surroundings before being pulled into a kitchen and then into a
lounge area.� He stopped in the middle of
the room and pushed her back into an old lounge, the springs creaking under
her.� 

&nbsp;

&quot;Don�t even think about moving,� he
warned her as he went into the room nearby.�
Jill could hear her grocery bags being put down on the table in the
kitchen and knew she would not have any chance of getting away.� She also knew that she could push him to use
his gun if she tried anything again, so just remained where she was.� Looking around the room, she was aware the
furniture was old, the room having an unlived in look.� Obviously the two brothers had not lived here
for long.� 

&nbsp;

The sound of footsteps returning to the
room made her look up to see the older brother returning with a number of ropes
and something else that she couldn�t quite make out in his hand. She shivered
as he reached out and gripped her hair, twisting her head to look up at him.

&nbsp;

�Good to see that you have found your
senses again, however it won�t stop me from securing you.� Fight me and you will just make me bind you
tighter. Understand bitch?� With that, he pulled on the rope tying her hands
and pulled her back up to her feet.� �First,
though, I think you have too many clothes on.�
I am going to untie your hands and you are going to take off your jeans
and your shirt.� Behave, and I will allow
you to keep your underwear on for now.�



Jill didn�t like the way he had said �for
now�, but moved quickly to remove her outer clothes, as soon as he had released
her hands.� She stood, feeling
embarrassed to be standing in front of two strange men in her underwear. The
younger brother had finished in the kitchen and was leaning against the frame
of the door.� He again had a slightly
concerned look on his face, even though she could clearly see the outline of
his cock bulging in his jeans.� 

&nbsp;

�Put your hands behind you back, wrists
facing up.�� Jill was ordered, and when
she did so, she felt her hands being tied firmly behind her back.� She gasped as she felt her bounds being
tightened, the pull on her arms making her breasts poke out.� She wanted to cover herself, but
couldn�t.� She felt him tie the end of
the rope around her hips, effectively holding her hands down onto her
bottom.� He then pushed her back down
onto an old armchair, the springs also creaking.�� Her legs were pushed up onto the edge of the
seat, while he tied her ankles to her thighs. He then pulled the end of each
rope over the arm of each chair, securing the rope to something she couldn�t
see on the floor.� By the time he was
done, she found that she was unable to close her legs.� Jill felt even more embarrassed than she had
a moment ago, knowing that her most private parts were on show, even if she
still had her underpants on.� 

&nbsp;

Nick stood back and looked at Jill. He had
not really intended to take things this far, but she had made him so angry that
he had acted without thinking. He could see her blush at the way he had exposed
her, and knew she wouldn�t like the last part of her bondage.� He had messed around with bondage a bit and
had brought some of his stuff with him, thinking he may get to use them again
one day. He couldn�t wait to see her reaction to the gag, it being one of
things about bondage that turned him on the most.� He just loved the look in a girl�s eyes and
as all the other woman had been consenting, he was
eager to see the difference.� 

&nbsp;

�Jill, I don�t think you are going to like
this very much, but I told you that you would be sorry if you pissed me off.�

&nbsp;

�He
saw her look confused as she tried to work out what he was holding and then
when she realised what it was, her eyes grew wide and she began to beg.

&nbsp;

�Please don�t use that. I will be good, I
promise.� 

&nbsp;

Jill had never seen one before but thought
what he held in his hand was called a ball gag.�
She tried to back away, but soon just hit the back of the seat.
�Please,� she hated to sound so desperate, but the thought of wearing that
thing just scared her so much. The man just grabbed her cheeks until he had her
mouth open and pushed the ball into her mouth.�
She struggled with her tongue to push it out, but he was too strong and
she felt her jaws spreading as he popped the ball behind her teeth.� He then just pushed her head down as he
tightened the straps, making the ball go in even further into her mouth.� When he had pulled her head back up, her jaw
was aching and she felt like her cheeks were being split in two.� 

&nbsp;

Nick stood back, the look on her face surpassing
anything he could have imagined.� She had
tears running down her face and was moaning loudly.� �Now Jill, I know I have made the gag tight,
but you need to learn to do as you are told. Now, if you sit quietly while I do
some things, I promise I will come back and loosen it. If you continue to make
a fuss, it will stay there all night if necessary.�� 

&nbsp;

Jill forced herself to breath deeply and
calm down, not wanting to keep the gag in for any longer than she had to. She
did not like the look on his face, it was almost as if
he liked to see her this way.� 

&nbsp;

�Good girl Jill, I can see you�re
trying.� If you can keep this up, I will
help make you feel better in a little while. For now, though, I have some money
to count.�� Jill watched him head off to
the kitchen, turning on the TV as he left the room.� She caught sight of the other brother still
standing in the doorway; the same concerned look on his face.� She wondered if he would be the one to help
her escape, though right now she knew she was not going anywhere.

&nbsp;

Tom had watched while Nick had tied Jill to
the chair. He wasn�t sure he liked what his brother was doing, but his cock
certainly did.� He had never seen a woman
look so vulnerable before, the way she was exposed and look in her eyes as Nick
had put the gag in something he had never seen before.� He had known that Nick had played around with
bondage but had never seen him in action. He went to check that Jill was ok
before he helped Nick with the money. 

&nbsp;

Jill had seen the younger brother watching
her and squirmed nervously in her binds as he walked towards her.� She hated being seen this way and wanted to
be anywhere else but here.� When he
reached out to stroke her hair, she leaned back until her head was resting on
the back of the seat.

&nbsp;

�Shhh Jill, It is ok.� I just wanted to make sure you could breath alright.� Nod
if you can?�� 

&nbsp;

Jill nodded; the gag was tight and it was
making her drool, but she could still breath. She
liked the way he was stroking her hair, feeling some comfort in what was
becoming a very uncomfortable situation. She tried to talk to him, to beg him
to take it out, but knew he would not be able to understand her.� 

&nbsp;

Tom could tell she wanted him to remove the
gag, but knew she would have to wait for Nick to do that.� 

&nbsp;

�Sorry love, I know you want the gag out,
but it has to stay there. I will try to check on you to make sure you are still
ok, but I can�t take it out.� 

&nbsp;

The look in her eyes was almost too much
for him to bear and he stood up to help his brother, leaving her softly crying.

Chapter Three � Humiliation

&nbsp;

Tom went into the kitchen where Nick had
already started to count the money from his bag.� His brother gave him a look as he picked up
his own bag, but didn�t say anything until they had finished counting. 

&nbsp;

�I got $8 540, how about you?�

&nbsp;

�Almost $12 000.� Not bad for five minutes
work.�� The two men talked about the job
and about getting new wigs before the next job, until Tom finally asked Nick
about Jill.

&nbsp;

�Nick, we have been avoiding talking about
what we really need to discuss.� What are
we going to do with Jill?�� Tom watched
Nick as he lit a cigarette, knowing that he did that when he was stalling.� 

&nbsp;

�I don�t know, to be honest with you.� I hadn�t really had time to think about that
until we were on the road and then it was too late. Then when she tried to
escape and I had an excuse to use some of my bondage on her, I realised how
much I had missed it.� I am thinking that
I might keep her here with us for a while and see how things go.� 

&nbsp;

�What, just keep her here, just like that!� Won�t she have
people looking for her?�

&nbsp;

�Well, we can�t just let her go and hope
she won�t tell anyone where we are, and unless you want to be the one to pull
the trigger, then we don�t have many options left.�� 

&nbsp;

Tom knew he was right.� He had no worries about robbing banks,
especially as they had never had to hurt anyone, but he knew he could never
kill anybody. He thought back to earlier when he had threatened her with the
gun, knowing he would have found it hard to even wound her slightly.� 

&nbsp;

�Ok, Ok, I am not a killer, but I not sure
I want to be responsible for keeping someone against their will either. She
just looks so scared in there.�

&nbsp;

�Oh yes, but that is the best part.� I just love it when they look up at you with
those big eyes, pleading with you to let them go. I nearly lost it back there
when I put that gag in.� Speaking of
gags, I did promise that I would loosen it a bit when we were done. See, I am
not all bad, I just know what I like.�

&nbsp;

Jill had begun to think that he would never
return and loosen the gag.� She thought
her jaw was never going to be the same again it was hurting so much.� She had managed to stop crying a while ago,
realising it was only making it harder to breath. Despite what she had said
earlier, she was having trouble with her breathing.� By the time the two men entered the room, she
was having to take shallow breaths and her chin and
breasts were covered with drool.� 

&nbsp;

Nick could not believe the sight before
him, Jill�s drool had worked to make her bra almost transparent, her breasts
rising and falling with her breathes.� He
saw her look up, pleading with him, as he approached her and almost came in his
pants at how she looked. 

&nbsp;

�Jill, love, you look so beautiful, but a
promise is a promise. Now, I know I said that I would loosen your gag, but I
really want to find out more about you, but if you piss me off again, it goes
back on, understand?�



Jill nodded, hoping he meant what she
thought he did. When he undid the straps and pulled the ball from her mouth,
she could only gasp.� She felt the pain
in her jaw as she worked her mouth, thinking it would never feel the same
again.� She hoped he would now remove her
from the rest of her binds but he went to sit down on the couch instead.� She could see the younger brother standing in
the doorway again but this time she could not read the expression on his
face.� 

&nbsp;

�Now Jill, I know you want me to untie you,
and I will soon, but I need you to answer some questions for me first. Tell me,
is there someone who is waiting for you to come home?� 

&nbsp;

Jill thought about telling him a lie, but� in her current
state thought it was not worth the effort. 

&nbsp;

�No, I am house-sitting and don�t know
anyone yet. I only moved to the town a few days ago.�� 

&nbsp;

Jill knew she had just told him all he
wanted to hear but didn�t have the strength to lie.

&nbsp;

�Good, now tell us a bit about yourself, what you do, where you come from, that sort of
thing.�� 

&nbsp;

Jill went to speak but found her throat
wouldn�t work.� She saw the younger man
go into the kitchen and come back with a glass of water. She thought water had
never tasted so good and was just savouring it, when he leaned down to whisper
in her ear.� 

&nbsp;

�Jill, remember what ever happens, I will
be here to keep an eye on you.� She didn�t know if that made her feel better or
worse. What was going to happen to make her need keeping an eye on? He moved
back to his spot by the door, reminding her she had questions to answer.� 

&nbsp;

�I come from a small town that no one has
ever heard of.� I am a shop assistant and
when my friend asked me to house sit for him, I
thought it would be a good change.�� 

Jill stopped to consider what a change it
was, she would never had thought that she would be abducted by two bank robbers
and be tied to a chair.� 

&nbsp;

�So no-one knows you are missing?� That is very interesting.� How old are you?�

&nbsp;

� I just turned twenty-three.�

&nbsp;

�What a great age. Now
just a few more questions.� Do you
have a boyfriend�

&nbsp;

Jill wondered whether to lie, but decided
it was better to just tell the truth.

&nbsp;

�I had one, but we broke up a few months
ago.�

&nbsp;

�Have you had sex since then.�

&nbsp;

�No.��
Jill was starting to feel embarrassed and wondered how many more
questions he would ask.

&nbsp;

�Jill, thank you for
being so honest.�
Now I am sure you are wondering what is going to happen. First though, I
am feeling hungry, how about you?�

&nbsp;

Jill realised that she was starving, her
stomach rumbling in protest.� It had been
hours since she had last eaten and that had only been some slices of
toast.� She saw him go into the kitchen and
heard the sound of drawers being opened and plates being put on the table. She
hoped she would be untied to eat, but nothing would surprise her anymore. When
she saw the younger brother also go into the kitchen, she decided she wasn�t
going to be allowed to eat.� She could
hear the two men talking in the kitchen and then the sounds of them
eating.� By the time the younger brother
returned to the room with a plate of food, she hadn�t been able to keep the
tears from running down her face, the feeling of being alone simply
overwhelming.

&nbsp;

�Hey, don�t cry, we didn�t forget you.� Here, I have brought you some food. I hope
you like chicken.�� At that point, she
didn�t care what it was, so long as she could eat it.� As she was feed the food, she looked at him.
His eyes were greyish blue and he had short wavy hair that was almost black.
She decided that he didn�t look like a bank robber but rather like a helpful
shop clerk or something.� He lifted a
glass to her lips, letting her take a big drink of the cool water.� The only trouble was that the water was
making her want to go to the toilet, not having been since hours before she had
been taken.

&nbsp;

�Please, I need to go the toilet. Can you
please untie me?� 

&nbsp;

Tom wished he could but knew that this was
Nick�s call. 

&nbsp;

�Love, you know I can�t do that. Just let
me talk to Nick.�

&nbsp;

�Thank you. Can I ask you something? What
is your name?�

&nbsp;

�My name is Tom.� Just wait and I will see what I can do to
help you�

&nbsp;

Jill watched him go, thinking that at least
he could be nice when he wanted to be.�
The other man, the one he had called Nick, she was not so sure of. She
really didn�t like the look he would get in his eyes sometimes.� When Nick entered the room, she saw that look
again but this time it was mixed with something else, like he was mad at her.
When he twisted her head back to yell in her face, she knew it was definitely
anger.

&nbsp;

�Bitch, who do you think you are, giving orders. When I want to untie you, I will, not a fucking
second before.� Don�t you ever try to get
my brother to go against me again.� Now as for taking a piss, if you need to go
so badly, then go.� You can always clean
the chair tomorrow.�� He let go of her
hair, storming back into the kitchen.� 

&nbsp;

Jill was stunned.� She had never had anyone treat her like she was
nothing before and she couldn�t stop the tears from rising up again.� She sat and sobbed, feeling like she was all
alone.� All the time she was crying, she
was fighting the feeling in her bladder.�
Suddenly she felt it give way and the feel of piss running onto the seat
under her only made her cry even more.� 

&nbsp;

When Tom returned to the room, he couldn�t
believe the change in her.� Any hope she
had had was gone and what was left was a women who looked like she had lost
everything.� He could see the wetness
spreading over the seat of the chair and on her panties.� He felt angry, not at her but at Nick for
making her humiliate herself in this way.�
He saw her look up at him and wondered why she looked so scared, until
he realised his anger must be showing.� He
bent down in front of her, ignoring the smell, and reached out to touch her
cheek. Like before, she flinched away, making him follow her head as it reached
the back of the seat.

&nbsp;

�Jill, I�m so sorry. I had to go out side
to get something and he was coming in to see you when I left. I had assumed he
would have let you go to the toilet. I really don�t know what else to
say.�� He felt ashamed of his brother�s
behaviour, tying someone up was one thing, making them piss their pants was another.� He was just
deciding what he would say to Nick, when he heard him enter the room.� He saw Jill tense up and stood up to face
him.

&nbsp;

�Well, isn�t that nice, you two want a room
or something?.� 

&nbsp;

�Nick, what is this?� I can almost understand you being angry and
making her suffer for a while but this is just wrong.� Making a grown women feel like a child just
because you are pissed off is just not right. If you don�t untie her now, I
will, she has had enough.�

&nbsp;

Nick remained silent all through his
brother�s tirade, his eyes taking in the 
look on Jill�s face.� 

&nbsp;

�Are you finished now? Good. Listen to me,
little brother, I am in charge here and if I want her to piss her pants, then
that is what will happen. Now if you want to challenge me then do it, but if
not then fuck off. I have plans for the night.�

&nbsp;

Tom wanted to challenge him so badly it
hurt, but he knew he would never win, especially when Nick was all riled
up.� He felt like a little boy again,
when Nick would take his toys and ask him to challenge him if he wanted them
back.� The only time he had ever taken
him on, Nick had beaten the crap out of him and he had never tried again. He
had never wanted to take him on again until tonight. 

&nbsp;

�Come on Nick, you know I don�t want to
fight you. I just think that there has to be a point where you have to draw the
line and this is one of them.� I just
want you to let Jill go so she can have a bath or a shower.�

&nbsp;

Jill listened to the two brothers fighting
about her, and couldn�t decide if it was a good thing or not. On one hand, at
least she knew that Tom was willing to stand up for her but if he was not able
to fight his brother, then it was all just a waste of time. Eventually, she
heard Nick agree that he would untie her and let her have a bath, but then she
started to worry about what he had said earlier about having plans for the
night. She had the awful feeling that those plans involved her.

Chapter Four � Nick�s plans

&nbsp;

Half an hour later, Jill had found out that
her feelings were correct. After she had been untied, she had been allowed to
have a bath, the warm water feeling wonderful on her sore and tired
muscles.� She was grateful that she had
been allowed to wash in private, though she had been warned that any attempt to
escape would result in her being tied up in more extreme bondage and left to
suffer all night.� Even if she had had a
plan, she was just too tired to try anything.�
After about ten minutes, Nick had come into the bathroom and told her it
was time to get out.� She had groaned as
she made her leg muscles work, knowing that he would see her body. He gave her
a towel to use, his eyes never leaving her body as she dried it.� Embarrassed by his gaze, she had tried to use
the towel to cover herself, only to find him snatching it away from her.� 

&nbsp;

�Don�t ever try to hide from me, bitch. You
belong to me now and if I want to see your body, I will.�

&nbsp;

Jill didn�t really understand what he was
talking about, but didn�t want to argue with him. When he dragged her into his
room and locked the door, she knew what he wanted.� She backed up as he walked towards her, not
noticing the bed and falling back onto it.�
Before she had the chance to get up, he was on top of her.� She tried to scream, but he was too fast, his
hand covering her mouth before any sound could come out.� 

&nbsp;

�Jill, listen to me. I am going to have sex
with you but it is up to you how it happens.�
Fight me and I will fight back, let me do what I want and I will promise
not hurt you, at least not too much.�

&nbsp;

Jill looked to see if that was a joke, but
he wasn�t smiling.� She could feel his
cock, hard and long in his pants, as he half lay on her.� Knowing he would win any fight, she relaxed
her body under his and tried to nod, hoping he would see this a sign of
surrender.� He did, letting his hand
leave her mouth and standing to remove his clothing.� She could already tell through his clothes
that he was strong but it was only when he removed his shirt that she could see
the muscles in his arms and back.� His
thighs were no different and framed what she could see was a very big
cock.� She began to worry how she would
be able to take it all and hoped he would give her time to prepare for him.

&nbsp;

Nick knew that she was watching him,
especially when he exposed his cock to her.�
He knew he was big and a few of his girlfriends had even complained that
he was too big.� He could see that she
was worried about his size and decided that unless she began to fight him
again, he would try to help her out a bit by making sure she was wet for
him.� She started to back up on the bed
but it only one look to make her stay still. 

&nbsp;

Jill saw the look on his face and
remembered what she had agreed to and lay still.� She was so scared she was shaking.� He told her to kneel on the bed and once he
was in position, he gripped his cock and rubbed it over her face.� Using every ounce of strength she had, she
remained still and let him continue.� The
moment she was dreading finally came, his cock pushing up against her
lips.� She opened her mouth and felt him
push in his cock in a one big rush, only stopping when she began to gag.� He pulled out a bit to let her breath and
then pushed back in again, this time not stopping when she gagged.� He only stopped when he was buried to the
hilt in her throat, his pubic hair tickling her nose.� She couldn�t breath and began to panic, her
fists hitting his chest in the vain hope she could make him move away.� His hands in her hair made her stop hitting
him and only then did he remove his cock enough to let her take a breath.� 

&nbsp;

�Bitch, I thought you didn�t want me to
fight you, but if that is what you want, that is what you will get�� 

&nbsp;

Before she had time to react, he had gripped
her by the ears and began to fuck her throat in earnest.� Jill barely had time to think, let alone
breathe as he pounded into her, using her face like he would a pussy.� She could only gag and cry, and hope it would
be over soon.� The first clue she had that
he was about to cum was his expanding to even bigger proportions in her throat
and then she was swallowing it.� The
first load he was still in her throat so she didn�t have to taste it, but then
he pulled out so that his cock was sitting on her tongue, forcing her to taste
it on the way down. She was so exhausted and her throat so sore by the time he
was finished, that she just wanted to sleep, but he had other plans.

&nbsp;

Nick had not felt anything so good in a
long time as the feel of Jill�s throat around his cock.� He knew that she had not really been fighting
him, that he had taken her by a bit by surprise, but he just could not resist
the urge to fuck her like he wanted to.� He
could see her now, exhaustion beginning to show on her pretty face.� 

&nbsp;

�Jill, that was not smart.� Now I am willing to give you another chance
to submit to me, or else I will just have to rape you. You don�t want that, do
you?� 

&nbsp;

Jill wasn�t sure if she could even speak,
her throat throbbing with pain. When she did try to speak she sounded croaky,
like she had a cold.

&nbsp;

�Please, I will be good. You don�t have to
rape me, see.�� 

&nbsp;

Jill lay on her back and spread her legs
wide, trying to convince him she was ready if not willing to let him use
her.� Nick saw her spread her legs for him
and felt his cock harden again.� He was
not a teenager any more, but at 26 felt he was still in his prime.� He placed two fingers at the entrance to her
pussy, not surprised that she was only a little bit wet.� He worked his fingers in and out, looking at
her face the whole time.�� She was
blushing, the redness rising up from her chest to her face. 

&nbsp;

�No need to blush, I am only rewarding you
for your compliance.� I know that I am a
lot to take and if you are well lubricated you will find things a bit easier.
Though by the feel of this tight pussy, you might still have a hard time at
first.�

&nbsp;

Jill�s blush deepened; not only at what he
was doing, but also at the casual way he was talking about sex.� Growing up, sex was never discussed in her
home and even with her boyfriend, she had never really talked about it.� Hearing him discuss her body so openly was
not something she was used to. Finally she could feel herself getting wetter
and an orgasm begin to form, though before she could cum he removed his fingers
and replaced them with the head of his cock.�
Trying to remain relaxed, Jill took a few deep breaths, which were
replaced by moans, the more he pushed inside her.� He was only half way in and she already felt
fuller than she had ever done.

&nbsp;

Nick knew that she would be tight, but
didn�t realise how tight until he was in her.�
He paused when he was about half way in, hearing her moan in pain.

&nbsp;

�Honey, I am only half way in yet, you have
to take some deep breaths for me now. That�s a girl, almost there now, just a
bit more, ah that�s it.� How does it feel
to have a real man�s cock in you?�

&nbsp;

Jill had only just heard what he was
saying, the feeling of his cock making it hard to breath.� It was only when he grabbed her chin to make
him look at her, that she realised he had been talking to her.

&nbsp;

�I said, how does it feel to have a real
man�s cock in you?�

&nbsp;

�It feels very big, I have never felt
anything like it before.� Please go slow,
I am really trying hard to do as you say.� 

&nbsp;

�Sure, I will start slow but you had better
hold on when I really hit my stride.� You
ain�t never had a ride like the one you are about to get.�

&nbsp;

Jill didn�t doubt him, and gripped the
sheet under her in readiness for him. It didn�t take long until she was almost
tearing at the sheets in pain, her body rocking back and forwards on the
bed.� He had kept his promise and moved
slowly in her for the first three or four thrusts, then when he felt she was
getting more used to him, he had begun to speed up.�� By the time he was about to cum, he was like
a jackhammer, the muscles in his legs rippling with each thrust.� When he was about to cum, he pulled out and
shot his load all over her chest and face, causing her to blush yet again.�� 

&nbsp;

Jill just lay there as he spurted all over
her. She felt dirty and just wanted to have another bath.� He fell down on the bed beside her, breathing
deeply as he tried to catch his breath. All the time, he had a hand in her
hair, holding her down onto the bed.�
After a few minutes, he lent up on one elbow to look at her.�� 

&nbsp;

�Wow, I haven�t had pussy that tight since
high school. You must have been a good girl all these years. Have you?�

&nbsp;

Jill couldn�t believe what he was asking
her, but knew better than to not answer.

&nbsp;

�If you mean have I not had much sex, than
you would be right.� Please, can I go to
the bathroom and wash up?�� She thought
how he had made her stay sitting in her own piss and hoped this was not what he
had planned for her tonight.� She could
see him considering her request and let out a sigh of relief when he
agreed.� She went to sit up but was
pulled back down by the hand he still had in her hair.

&nbsp;

�Hold on, you haven�t heard my conditions
yet.� If you want to go and clean up,
then you will have to do something for me.�
If you decide not to go, then you will stay this way until morning.� Now, if you go you will have to wear the gag
all night.� What will it be, the bathroom
or the gag?�

&nbsp;

Jill didn�t have to think too hard to know
that she could stand his cum all over her all night if she really had to but
knew the she could never stand wearing the gag all night.

&nbsp;

�I will stay her then, I couldn�t cope with
wearing that gag all night.� She saw him smile and knew that he had thought she
would say that.� 

&nbsp;

�Ok, now we have that sorted you have just
one more thing to do before we can both get some sleep.� I need you to clean my cock first.�� He could see her confused look, glancing in
the direction of the bathroom.� �I didn�t
say you had to go to the bathroom to clean my cock, just use your mouth.� He
loved the shocked look on her face, loving the way her eyes were as big as
saucers.

&nbsp;

�You can�t be serious, just let me get a
wet cloth. I won�t use it to clean myself, promise.�

&nbsp;

�Ok then, I will get the gag ready while
you are gone.�

&nbsp;

�No! Ok you win.� 

&nbsp;

Jill bent down to clean his cock, now
curled up against his thigh.�� She knew
she was tasting herself mixed with his cum, but tried not to think about that
as she did the job. When she was finished, she lay back and looked up at the
ceiling, not wanting to look at him. He pulled her around, making her face him.

&nbsp;

�Jill, I know I have pushed you hard
tonight, but you have done very well.� I
can see that you have real potential and I intend to keep you here with me for
a while. Good night and try to get some sleep as I have a big day planned for
us tomorrow.�

&nbsp;

He turned of the light and rolled her onto
her side, placing one arm across her breasts and the other around her waist.
She could feel his cock resting against her leg as she tried to get some sleep.
Despite being exhausted, she could not get what he had said out of her mind.
She didn�t know what he meant by her having real potential but knew it was not
good.� At least it didn�t sound like he
was going to kill her but she was not sure she wanted too many days like she�d
had today. She finally got to sleep a few hours later, though it was a troubled
one full of dreams of guns and violence.�


&nbsp;

Beside her Nick had woken a few times,
aware of her restlessness.� He knew that
she would be thinking about what he had said. He had never held a woman against
her will before, never even thought about it, but he was starting to feel
excited. He thought back on what he had heard and read about training women to
be a slave. He would have to look up a few web sites and get some ideas, but he
knew enough to know that one important element to training was the mental one,
and he knew he already had a head start on that one.� He could hardly wait to begin, but for now it
was sleep time.

Chapter Five � Breakfast

&nbsp;

Jill tried to hide her embarrassment at
wearing only a small, frilly apron to prepare the breakfast.� Nick had woken her, used her body again and
finally let her clean off his cum that had dried on her breast during the
night.� She hadn�t found his cock any
easier to handle and her pussy was quite sore.�
She knew that she was still red and swollen, but tried hard not to think
about it too much.� The sound of the two
men entering the room made her freeze, all thought of being able to ignore her
current situation gone.� She knew that
they would be getting a good view of her bottom, hidden only slightly by the
bow on the apron.� The way they had both
stopped speaking as they entered the room, told her they were looking at her.

&nbsp;

Tom could not believe his eyes as he saw
Jill wearing only the frilly apron.� He
wondered where Nick had found it, but soon found himself forgetting about the
apron as he looked at her body.� He knew
he should look away, but the sight of her firm ass just made him hard.� He had heard Nick using her the night before
and as much as he wanted to help her, he also found part of him wanted to fuck
her too.� He had never taken a woman
against her will but he hoped that she would willingly let him have sex with
her while she was here.� He knew that
could be very unlikely, but was determined that he would not take her unless
she was willing.

&nbsp;

�Tom, we can take a photo if you like.�

&nbsp;

Tom heard his brother�s comment and looked
away, not only embarrassed for himself but for Jill as well.� He saw Nick move over to her and give her
slap on her bottom, as he leant down to talk to her.� 

&nbsp;

�How is the breakfast going? I don�t have
all day you know. By the way, I love the way your ass looks in this apron,
lucky thing the last owners left a few things behind, wasn�t it?�� 

&nbsp;

Jill did not think he expected an answer,
so just continued stirring the eggs.� She
wanted to get the food made so she could turn around and hide her bottom from
view.� Not that the front view was much
better, the apron barely covering her chest and not quite coming to the bottom
of her pussy but at least she would feel more covered.� She had heard his comment to tom and knew
that he too had been looking at her. She heard Tom cough behind her, and could
tell that he was uncomfortable too.

&nbsp;

�Nick, it is going to be a while, maybe
I�ll just go and do something outside until you call me.�� He just wasn�t comfortable with seeing Nick
with Jill.� 

&nbsp;

�No, it is almost ready, isn�t it
Jill.� See, she has the eggs ready and I
can see the toast about to pop.�

&nbsp;

Tom sat down at the table, feeling like he
should be doing something, but not wanting to get in Jill�s way.� As she placed the food on the table, he could
see that she was avoiding looking at him.�
Nick sat down and Jill just stood waiting by the table.� He wanted to tell her to sit down, but knew
that Nick was the one in charge.� 

&nbsp;

�This looks great, better then I could have
done. Now how about a cuppa?� 

&nbsp;

�Ok, tea or coffee?�

&nbsp;

�I feel like a cup of tea, what about you
Tom?� 

&nbsp;

�Yeah, whatever.� 

&nbsp;

Jill was pleased to have something to do,
rather then just standing there with them both looking at her.� Although she could tell that Tom was trying
not to look, she had seen him glance up at her once or twice.� 

&nbsp;

�Well, little brother, what do you think of
our maid?� Not bad, hey?�

&nbsp;

�What? Oh yeah, the food looks great.� Where did the apron come from?�

&nbsp;

�Fuck the apron Tom, I wasn�t asking you
about the food or the apron, but he body in the apron.� What do you think of her body, pretty good
hey?�

&nbsp;

�Come on Nick, you know I like her body but
you don�t have to embarrass her any more than she already is.�

&nbsp;

Tom had lowered his voice, but in such a
small space, he knew Jill would have heard him.�
She was just pouring boiling water into a teapot, having already placed
some cups, sugar and milk on the table.�
He saw her shake as she carried the pot and couldn�t help standing up
and taking the it from her. He could see the smirk on Nick�s face but just
ignored it as he placed the pot on the table.

&nbsp;

�Well, what a gentleman you are. Who would
have thought we were both raised in the same house?�

&nbsp;

Nick could see Jill moving from foot to
foot, her eyes down. He thought he could see some tears, but wasn�t sure.

&nbsp;

�Hey love, come here and sit down. You must
be tired after all that cooking.�

&nbsp;

He saw her look at the empty chair on the
other side of the table and shook his head at her, pointing to his lap.�� Hesitating for just a moment, she moved and
sat gingerly on his lap. He could feel her ass cheeks against his thigh, her
body shaking slightly as she perched on his knee.� However, it was when he reached down and
stroked a finger along her slit; that she really began to shake. 

&nbsp;

�What�s wrong honey, still a bit sore there
are you?�� 

&nbsp;

Jill just wanted to curl and die, but all
she could do was sit there and let him touch her.� Gratefully, he removed his finger and began
to eat, feeding her some eggs while she sat there.� Across the table, Tom was trying hard not to
look at her, his eyes down on his plate. However, she could him peek at look
every so often.� Tom suddenly standing
up, causing her to fall in a heap on the floor startled her. Even more
startling to her, was the way he just told her to clean up and meet him in the
lounge room when she was done.

Chapter Six � A Helping Hand 

&nbsp;

Feeling like an rag that had just been
tossed on the floor, Jill could feel her tears start again.� She wondered what would happen if she just
stayed there, if he would eventually get tired of waiting for her and come in
and get her.� The sound of a chair
scraping on the floor reminded her that she was not alone.� Suddenly being aware of how she must look,
she was just moving her hand to cover herself when saw Tom�s shoes moving
towards her. When he reached down a hand to her, she hesitated for a moment,
before swallowing her shame and letting him help her up.

&nbsp;

Tom could not believe the way Nick had just
treated Jill.� He was starting to wonder
if he even knew his brother at all, having never seen him act this way.� When he looked at Jill lying on the floor,
her apron flipped back, giving him a clear view of her pussy.� He could see that she was starting to cry and
saw her move to cover herself when he moved his chair to stand up.� He thought he had never seen anyone look so
pitiful then how she looked at that moment.�
He reached down his hand to help her, hoping she would let him, though
she would not blame her if she didn�t want his help.� He certainly hadn�t been much help to her so
far.� 

&nbsp;

Jill took the hand offered to her, allowing
herself to be stood up.� The shame of the
incident was too much and she turned so that she would not have to see Tom�s
face.� A gentle but firm touch on her
shoulder made her turn back to him.� As
he turned her around to him, she kept her head down.� Placing a hand on her chin, he lifted her
head so she no choice but to look at him.�


&nbsp;

�Jill, are you OK?� I don�t know what has got into Nick, I have
never seem his act this way.� 


When Jill could see that he was not going to leave her be, she sighed.

&nbsp;

�To be honest Tom, I am far from OK.� I have been abducted, tied up, humiliated,
made to do things I didn�t want to do and to top it off, treated like a
dishrag.� So I am definitely not
OK!�� 

&nbsp;

Jill could not believe what she had just
said, but she was sick of being treating like nothing.� She hoped that Nick had not heard her
outburst.

&nbsp;

�Oh God Jill, I don�t know what to
say.� Of course you are not OK. Come on,
sit down for a moment.�

&nbsp;

Tom led Jill to sit in one of the kitchen
chairs, pleased that she wasn�t fighting him.�
Once she was seated, he poured her a cup of tea, lifting the cup to her
lips so she could drink it.� After a few
sips, she took the cup from his hand and began to drink the tea herself.� He could see some colour come back to her
cheeks and her tears had stopped.

� 

�Jill, look at me. I know I haven�t done
much to help you so far, I certainly wasn�t any help last night, but I will try
my best.�

&nbsp;

Jill looked at him, disbelief on her face.

&nbsp;

�Tom, you don�t know how much you have
helped me. �If you weren�t here to pick
me up and just let me know you care, then I would be in far worse shape then I
am now.� I didn�t mean to yell at you
just then, I was just so angry all of a sudden.�

&nbsp;

It was Tom�s turn to look at her with
disbelief.� 

&nbsp;

�How can you say that, when I could hear
you crying last night when you were with Nick?�
I just felt so useless, though I did want to help you.�� 

&nbsp;

Jill dropped her head in shame at the
thought of what had happened the night before.

&nbsp;

�Tom, don�t. It happened and I dare say it
will happen again.� Unless you can make
him stop, then just be here when I need you, even if it is just to pick me up
of the floor. Now, I had better get this kitchen cleaned up before Nick comes
looking for me.�

&nbsp;

Tom could see that she was just putting on
a brave face, but if that was what she felt she had to do to survive, then he
would not be the one to stop her. He left her cleaning up the kitchen, her ass
swaying as she washed the dishes.� He
wondered how long he would be able to live in the same house and not give into
his urges to feel her under him.� He
didn�t know how but he knew he would try.

Chapter Eight � Separate lives

&nbsp;

Tom woke with his head pounding and no
memory of anything past drinking with his brother.� His mouth felt like someone animal had curled
up and died in there and his hand was sore where he had hit his brother.� He thought he could hear a noise and wondered
if there was a bird outside his window or something.� He felt something move on the bed beside him
as the same time he became aware of something soft under his hand.� He moved his hand, hearing the same sound as
before but this time it was louder.�
Trying to work out what it was, he moved his hand around, feeling what
felt like a nipple under his fingers.� 

&nbsp;

Tom suddenly opened his eyes, his mind
finally realising what he was feeling.�
What he saw made him jump up of the bed in shock, his mind trying to
work out why Jill was here in his room.�
He was even more concerned about why she was looking at him the way she
was.� If he didn�t know better, he would
say she was scared of him. He looked around to find his glass of water; his
movements making her crawl back on the bed and look at him like a rabbit caught
in the headlights. 

&nbsp;

Jill�s heart was beating a million miles an
hour as Tom stood looking at her. She knew that logically she had no reason to
fear him now, as he was no longer drunk, but she was not feeling very logical.
He had really hurt her and she wasn�t sure that he wouldn�t again.� When he moved to get a drink of water from
his side table, she just about bolted off the bed, but not knowing what his
reaction would be, she didn�t.� She saw
him watching her as he drank, confusion evident in his eyes.� She wondered if he even remembered what he
had done to her. Putting the glass down he moved to sit on the bed, making her
try to squirm back even more into the wall behind her.�� 

&nbsp;

�Jill, I am not sure what went on last
night, but I can tell by how my head feels that I got a little drunk.� And judging from your reaction, I have done
something to upset you. Do you think you could fill me in?�

&nbsp;

Jill looked at him, seeing the old Tom but
still not quite trusting him.� She didn�t
really want to think about what he had done, but had to think of something to
say.

&nbsp;

�You did get a little drunk. I just wasn�t
used to seeing you that way, that is all.�

&nbsp;

Jill hoped that he was too hung over to
notice that she had not answered his question fully.� He looked at her with a puzzled look,
obviously trying to fill in the gaps.

&nbsp;

�OK, so I got a little drunk, but that does
not explain why you are here and why you are looking at me like you are. �Come on Jill, give me some help here.�

&nbsp;

�Please Tom, just leave it.� It must be time for me to start on breakfast,
so if you will let me pass, I�ll go and get to work.�� 

&nbsp;

Jill went to move of the bed, but Tom
blocked her way, not touching her but causing her to flinch anyway.� When he reached his hand to touch her hair,
he was surprised to see the fear in her eyes.�
He continued moving his hand towards her, her eyes never leaving his as
he finally reached her head.� He thought
she was acting as if he expected him to hurt her and he began to really worry
about what had happened last night.

&nbsp;

�Jill, love, I�m not going to hurt you, you
know that I would never do that.�

&nbsp;

Jill could not look him in the eye, sure
that he would know what he had done if she did.

&nbsp;

�Jill, please look at me.� You are starting to scare me.� Did I do something I shouldn�t have done last
night?�

&nbsp;

At the mention of the night before, he saw
her tense up and knew something was seriously wrong.� 

&nbsp;

�Jill, you are not leaving here until I
know what happened.� Now tell me, did I
pass out on you or what?� 


Tom didn�t want to make her more scared than she looked already, but he needed
to find out what had happened so that he could clear the air between them. He
was sure it was something as simple as her helping him to bed and him falling
asleep on her. 

&nbsp;

�Tom, please, don�t make me tell you.� I just want to forget about last night,
please.�

&nbsp;

Tom could see the tears in the corners of
her eyes and knew more happened than him just falling asleep on her.� 

&nbsp;

�Jill, I have obviously done something
bad.� I want to know how much I need to
beg you to forgive me. Please Jill.�

&nbsp;

Jill knew that he would not give up and
drew in a deep breath trying to find some inner strength to get through the
next few minutes.� 

&nbsp;

�Well it all started with you and Nick
drinking out on the porch. You were getting pretty drunk and Nick had me give
him a blowjob.� 

&nbsp;

Tom could see that she was taking her time,
making him more worried about what she had to tell him.

&nbsp;

�Yes, I remember drinking but it all gets a
bit fuzzy after that. Hold on, I do seem to remember you and Nick, but if it
was last night or another time, I am not sure.�

&nbsp;

Jill blushed, despite having been made into
a real life sex slave; she still blushed hearing someone talk about what she
was made to do.� Tom could see her blush,
sorry that he had to remind her of how Nick treated her.

&nbsp;

�Jill, I am sorry. That was insensitive of
me.� Ok, so what happened after that?�

&nbsp;

The way she looked away told him it was
something he properly didn�t want to hear.

&nbsp;

�Um well, you ..Oh god Tom, you made me
suck you off too.�

&nbsp;

Tom could not believe what he had heard but
the look in her eyes told him he had not misheard her.

&nbsp;

�Oh Jill, I am so sorry. Did I hurt you?�

&nbsp;

Jill just nodded, not wanting to have to go
into too many details.� She was still
trying to work out how to tell him the rest of what he had done.

&nbsp;

�I have the feeling there is more that you
haven�t told me.� Is that right?�

&nbsp;

He saw her nod again, her eyes again
avoiding his. He let her take a few minutes, dreading what she had to tell him.
Finally he could see she was ready to go on.

&nbsp;

�After I gave you the blowjob you brought
me in here and �and you �� God this is
hard� Tom, you raped me!�� 

&nbsp;

Tom felt sick. He looked at her, trying to
see if she was serious and he knew that she was.

&nbsp;

�What did I do? Jill I know I have no right
to ask you, but I need to know.�� 

&nbsp;

�You first asked me to bend over the bed
and show me my ass.� When I was slow to
react you forced me down on my knees.�

&nbsp;

He had noticed her bruises but had thought
they were from something Nick had done.

&nbsp;

�Did I do that?�� He asked, pointing to her knees.� He was also beginning to notice other bruises
beginning to darken on her arms and thighs and wondered if had caused those
too.� 

&nbsp;

�Yes.�
You were really rough.� You put
three fingers in my ass and then you�you used your cock.�

&nbsp;

Tom had thought that making her give him a
blowjob was bad enough but hearing that he had raped her in the ass was like he
was living in a nightmare.� He had never
had anal sex before and the thought of raping anyone there made him feel
ashamed.

&nbsp;

�God Jill, I really don�t know what to say.
Sorry just doesn�t seem to be enough.� If
I hurt you, I promise I will never do that again.�

&nbsp;

At his words, Jill began to cry, deep sobs
that seemed to tear his heart out.� When
he tried to comfort her, she shrank away from him, scrambling off the bed and
running out into the house.� He stayed on
the bed, hearing her in the kitchen banging the pots and plates around.� He had raped her; he just could believe he
had done that.� He knew he had to get
away from here, had to clear his head.�
He didn�t really like the thought of leaving Jill here with Nick but no
longer trusted himself not to hurt her again. He began to pack, stopping to
write Nick a note, hoping he was still sleeping. 

&nbsp;

In the kitchen, Jill had started to prepare
breakfast when she just couldn�t take it anymore.� Sliding down the counter, she sat on the
floor and cried.� When she heard the back
door slam and Tom�s car start up, she knew that he had gone.

Chapter Nine � Regrets

&nbsp;

It was two weeks since Tom had left and he
was not doing very well. He had tried to forget about Jill and what he had done
to her, but he kept waking up in a sweat, his dreams filled with images of what
she said he had done.�� He just felt so
guilty about everything, including leaving her there with Nick.� That was why he was now sitting in his car,
about ten minutes from the house, waiting for Nick to leave to do the weekly
shop.� It had become a pattern over the
time they had been together in the house, with Jill being tied up and the two
of them going into town to grab a meal at the local pub and then buy the
groceries for the next week.� He hoped
that Nick had kept to the same routine, and after waiting for over an hour, he
was rewarded by the sight of Nick driving down the road.� 

&nbsp;

He waited for another ten minutes before he
drove up to the house.� He didn�t know
what Jill�s reaction to seeing him would be, but he was set on what he had to
do.� Using the spare key they left under an
old boot, he let himself in and looked for Jill. She was usually kept in Nick�s
room and this proved to be where she was this time too.� She saw her spin around as he entered the
room but as Nick had her blindfolded, she didn�t know it was him.� Nick had as usual used a gag too, so he could
hear her mumbling, trying to ask who was there.�
He didn�t speak to her as he untied her from the bed. Nick had tied her
in a way that meant then he was able to untie the ropes from the bed but her
hands and legs were still tied together. He picked her up and put her over his
shoulder, feeling her attempt to struggle in vain.

&nbsp;

Jill tried to scream as she felt herself
being lifted up onto what had to be a�
man�s shoulder. She was sure it was not Nick and as Tom had not been
back for a least two weeks, she could only assume it was someone else.� She kicked her legs, but the way she was tied
with her knees and ankles bound, made it a fairly useless exercise.� She could tell that she was being carried out
of the house and felt herself being placed on the backseat of a car.� She felt something being thrown over her and
then without a word, she heard the man shut her door and before she knew it,
the car was moving.

&nbsp;

He did not speak all the time he drove and
it was many hours later until she felt the car stop.� She heard him leave the car and the sound of
voices. She tried to make herself be heard but knew it was useless.� She couldn�t believe someone had just walked
in and taken her, her only hope being that it really was Nick and he was
playing a nasty game with her.� She
became aware of the engine starting up and then the car stopping again a few
minutes later. She lay frozen, as her door was opened and whatever had been
over her removed.� He again carried her
on his shoulder, holding her still while he opened a door and sat her down
gently onto a seat of some kind.� Her
heart beating wildly, she waited to see what he would do now.� 

&nbsp;

Tom looked at her; not looking forward to
her reaction when she knew it was him who had abducted her. He sighed and knew
he couldn�t keep her tied up forever.� He
removed the gag first, hearing her moan as she worked her jaw.� Putting a finger on her lips, he signalled her
to stay silent.� He then moved to remove
her blindfold, keeping his eyes on her as he did.

&nbsp;

Jill stayed silent, not wanting to upset
the man.� Over the last two months she
had learnt that there were some battles she could not win, and this seemed to
be one of them.� When he removed the
blindfold, it took a moment for her to focus her eyes.� When she saw who it was that had taken her,
she didn�t know whether to be worried or relieved.� On one hand she was relieved to know who it
was but she wondered what he had in mind. She still had not gotten over how he
had raped her.� 

&nbsp;

�Jill, I don�t want you to panic, I am not
going to hurt to.� I am going to let you
speak but if you choose to scream, I will have to put the gag back in. Do you
understand?�

&nbsp;

Jill nodded and felt him move his finger
from her mouth. She did not scream but still did not trust him.� 

&nbsp;

�Good girl, now I know I surprised you but
I am only trying to make up for all that has been done to you.� I will explain more later, but first I
imagine you would like a shower.� I have
also ordered some food, which should be here in a little while�

&nbsp;

Tom could see that she was still not sure
of him and he really couldn�t blame her.�
He stepped back to let her stand, hoping to show her that he really
meant her no harm.� She looked up at him
with a mixture of confusion and some fear, slowing standing up and moving
toward the bathroom.� He hated that she
was still so scared of him, but knew that he would have to win back her trust
slowly.� 

&nbsp;

Jill walked into the shower, half expecting
him to follow her. She had grown so used to being watched during her every
private moment that it seemed strange to be alone.� She quickly stepped in the shower, letting
the water ease her aching muscles from being tied up in the same position for
so long.� She became aware of the sounds
of talking from the other room and froze.�
What if he had tricked her?� Was
he planning to let someone else use her body?�
She smelt the food and felt silly when she remembered that he had
mentioned food being delivered.� Too late
she realised she could have yelled out and gotten some help, but she had heard
him say thanks and the door close. The smell of the food made her stomach
rumble.� She looked around for a towel to
dry herself and found two big, fluffy ones.�
Seeing the towels, she had an idea; one that would let her know if he
really meant her no harm.

&nbsp;

Tom heard her open the shower door,
surprised by what he saw. Jill had one big towel wrapped around her hair and
another one wrapped around her chest.� He
realised it was the first time he had seen her covered for a long time, Nick
having removed all her clothes within the first week she was with them. He
could see the challenge in her eyes and realised that she was testing him,
seeing what he would do.� He knew that if
he told her to remove the towels she would see that as a sign that he wanted to
control her.� 

&nbsp;

�Jill, you look beautiful. I have brought
some clothes for you to wear, but if you want to stay as you are, then go for
it.�

&nbsp;

He could see her trying to work out if her
was telling the truth about the clothes and moved to put a bag onto the
bed.� He tipped the clothes he had bought
before he came to get her onto the bed.�
Jill looked at the clothes, starting to think that maybe he was really
only trying to help her.� She sat down on
the bed and looked through the pile of clothes, seeing jeans, tops and few
skirts and underwear. 

&nbsp;

�I hope the sizes are ok, I had to get the
sales girl to try them on as she was about your size.�

&nbsp;

He left her looking at the clothes and went
to set out the food.� Jill just sat,
feeling the clothes and wondering if this was really happening. Was he going to
see her free?� Why else would he buy her
clothes? She jumped as he placed a plate of pasta on the bed, her mouth
watering at the smell. They both ate in silence, Jill eyeing him throughout the
meal as if he was going to suddenly change back into the monster from two weeks
ago.� 

&nbsp;

Tom could see her watching him and wished
that he knew what to say to make him look at her again the way she used
to.� He removed the plates when they were
both finished and sat back down on the end of the bed.� 

&nbsp;

�Jill, I know I have given you no reason to
trust me, but you have to believe that I only want what is best for you.�� 

&nbsp;

Over the last two weeks, he had reflected
on his actions since the day of the robbery. He had felt a growing unrest over
his inability to save Jill from his brother�s attentions and even worse about
what he had done to her. 

&nbsp;

�I want to give you a choice. If you wish,
tomorrow I will drive you to the nearest bus station and you can go anywhere
you want to.�

&nbsp;

Jill could see the serious look on his face
and for the first time since her abduction began to think she would be free one
day.

&nbsp;

�You said I had a choice, what is the other
one.�

&nbsp;

�You can stay with me.�

&nbsp;

Tom thought he could see a look of disgust
cross her face, before she stood up and walked to look out the window.

&nbsp;

�Jill, I don�t need to know right now, but
I will need an answer by the morning. I am going to have a shower.�

&nbsp;

She had not moved as he was speaking to her
and he decided she needed some time to herself. Once Jill could hear the shower
running, she turned and walked to the front door, expecting it to be locked.
When she turned the knob and the door opened, she was surprised.� Walking outside, she could see that they were
in a cabin of some sort and could hear the sounds of children laughing
somewhere.� She went to walk to see where
the sounds were coming from, when she realised she still had the towel on. 

�
She heard the shower stop and even though she knew she should go back inside,
she was enjoying the fresh air too much.�
It had been a long time since she had been outside on her own, and
decided if Tom didn�t like it, he could just come and get her.� She sat down on a seat under a nearby tree
and waited to see what he would do.

&nbsp;

Tom came out of shower, drying his hair
with the towel he had managed to find in the bathroom cupboard, and
stopped.� Jill was gone and the door was
open.� He wondered if he had made a
mistake and if she was right now getting help. He could see that the pile of
clothes were still where she had left them, so wherever she was, she was still
wearing the towel. Taking his keys from his pocket, he ran outside, only to be
stopped in his tracks by the sight of Jill sitting under the tree.� He felt like he was intruding on a private
moment, though he still walked over towards her.

&nbsp;

Jill braced herself; this would be the real
test. He would either leave her alone or drag her kicking and screaming back
inside.� When he simply sat down beside
her, she breathed a sigh of relief.� She
began to feel some of the stress of the last two months start to ease as he
continued to sit in silence.� 

&nbsp;

�It is really nice out here.� Nick and I have used these cabins once
before, as they are nice and private.�

&nbsp;

Tom saw her flinch at the mention of his
brother�s name and could have kicked himself.�
He saw her tense up again, her hands fidgeting in her lap. He remained
silent, watching the sun setting behind the trees.� Finally it was almost dark and he stood up,
holding out his hand for her to take. 

&nbsp;

Jill saw his hand and remembered the first
time he had done that, when she he had helped her out of the car on that first
day.� She looked up at him, her mind a
mess of emotion.� Eventually, she placed
her hand in his and allowed him to lead her back into the cabin.� All the time she had sat beside him, she had
been thinking of all the ways he had helped her, but she still could not get
the memory of him raping her out of her mind.�
She thought that under different circumstances she could have really
fallen for him, but she just couldn�t trust him yet.� 

&nbsp;

Jill spent the next hour pretending to read
the magazine telling all about the lake near the cabins.� She had found herself reading the same line
over and over, and finally gave up.� All
the time she was reading, Tom just sat on the bed, thinking about what his life
would be like if she actually decided to come with him.� He would treat her like she deserved to be
treated and protect her from harm. He shook his head to clear away the fantasy
and saw that she had put down the book.�
Frustrated at letting himself get carried away, he stood suddenly and
went to the small fridge in the corner.

&nbsp;

�This is crazy, I need a drink!�

&nbsp;

He reached into the fridge and pulled out a
beer, the same type that he had shared with Nick back at the house.� He finished the can in a few minutes and had
just reached in to get another one, when he noticed that Jill was sitting with
her arms wrapped around her legs, her face a mask of fear.� 

&nbsp;

�Please, don�t have any more Tom.� I will do anything you want, just don�t have
any more to drink.�

&nbsp;

Jill had begun to shake as he downed the
first can so quickly, her mind going back to the last time he had been
drunk.� Though she knew he could not get
drunk from one can of beer, it was what could happen if he kept drinking that
worried her. She had noticed four more cans in the fridge, plus a number of
other spirits as well.� 

&nbsp;

Tom shut the fridge and moved to sit on the
bed.� 

&nbsp;

�Jill, It is ok, I don�t intend to get drunk,
I just needed a drink.�

&nbsp;

Jill still looked at him with fear and he
decided that the best thing to do was to leave her alone and just go to bed. He
couldn�t get what she had said out of his head; how she had offered to do
anything he wanted.� As much he longed to
take her up on her offer, he knew that it would only force her to leave him. 

&nbsp;

When she saw him stand up and begin to
undress, she cringed and began to whimper. She closed her eyes, seeing him as
he had been that night. When he touched her shoulder, she screamed, her mind
numb with fear.� The feel of his hand
covering her mouth caused her to open her eyes and look at him.� 

&nbsp;

�Jill, honey, you need to calm down.� Now just take a few deep breaths and I will
be able to take my hand away.�

&nbsp;

He watched as she did what he said, her
eyes never leaving his.� He noticed that
her towel had slipped, bearing her breasts.�
Though he had seen her naked plenty of times, it was like he had never
seen her body before. He felt his cock start to respond.� He also thought about how this could in all
reality be the last night she would be with him, so he had nothing to
loose.� He allowed his hand to move from
her mouth to caress her breasts, her breath coming out in gasps as he touched
her.� He moved his hand down further,
removing the towel completely and running his finger over her slit. Despite her
gasps, he continued to rub until his finger found its way inside her.� 

&nbsp;

Jill could feel his finger working its way
inside of her.� She felt numb; her mind
unable to register what he was doing to her.�
She felt him lie her down on the bed and spread her legs, his mouth
moving down to lick her.� Despite what
she was feeling, she felt her body begin to react, her orgasm building until
she exploded under him.� By the time she
had recovered, he had his cock in her pussy, gently sliding it in and out. Jill
looked up at the ceiling, trying to block out what he was doing. He wasn�t
hurting her but she just wanted him off her.�


&nbsp;

Tom felt his cock start to swell as he
neared his climax.� He could not believe
how wonderful she felt, her pussy warm and tight, despite her time with
Nick.� He tried not to think about what
she was thinking, just wanting to enjoy the moment.� When he finally came and pulled out, she just
rolled away and faced the wall.� He
wanted to hold her but thought it best to leave her be, so just turned off the
light and went to sleep.� 

&nbsp;

Jill lay staring at the wall, not wanting
to move in case she woke him up.� When he
had been snoring for a while, she crept out of the bed and went into the
bathroom, needing to use the toilet. As she sat, she found the tears she had
held back flow out. Before she knew it, she was sobbing loudly, not even
thinking of the man sleeping in the other room.�


&nbsp;

Tom woke to the sound of loud sobs, his
mind taking a moment to remember where he was.�
He stood and moved to the bathroom, following the sound of the
sobs.� He saw her huddled on the toilet
and felt like the biggest bastard for what he had done. 

&nbsp;

�Jill, honey, are you alright. I didn�t
hurt you, did I?� 

&nbsp;

Jill had not heard him come into the room
and jumped as he spoke.� 

&nbsp;

�Just leave me alone, you have done enough
already.�

&nbsp;

The anger in her voice was unexpected and
made Tom take a step back.

&nbsp;

�I thought you were different, but you are
just like him, only you hide it better.�
It doesn�t matter whether you hurt me or not, you let me down. I was
just beginning to think that maybe I could learn to trust you again, but know I
don�t want to even look at you.�� 

&nbsp;

Jill pushed her way past him, not even
taking the time to see the stunned look on his face.� She went back to the bed, her only thoughts
ones of getting on that bus to freedom in the morning.

Chapter Ten � Home

&nbsp;

Jill watered her garden, the flowers
blowing gently in breeze. She had returned to her hometown, telling no one
about her experiences over the last two months. Her family and friends were
used to her going off for months on end with little or no contact, so had not
even realised she had been missing. She had had a bit more trouble explaining
to her friend why she not been looking after his house but the lose of one
friend was worth keeping her secret. 

&nbsp;

It had been almost a year and she thought
she doing well, until she turned on her TV to see Nick�s face. It seemed that
he had gone back to robbing banks on his own and had gotten caught.� The police were able to link him to a number
of other robberies and he had been sent to prison for at least twenty
years.� Jill had sat; staring at the
screen long after his image had gone.�
She had tried so hard to forget everything that had happened, but the
sight of the face of the man who had tormented her for two months brought it
all back. She felt like it was yesterday, the pain, the humiliation, Tom. She
had tried the hardest to forget Tom. 

&nbsp;

That morning in the cabin, she had dressed
in silence before he woke, waiting on a chair near the door for him to wake
up.� When he had opened his eyes and seen
her sitting, dressed, he had sighed and dressed as well.� He had not even asked her what her choice
was, just driving her to the nearest bus depot, giving her enough money to get
her wherever she needed to go. As they stood waiting for the bus, he had tried
to talk to her, but she had turned away and he had given up.� The last image she had of him was from out of
the bus window as it turned the corner.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Tom had spent the past eighteen months
establishing himself as a real estate agent, having moved across the country to
a small town.� He had a nice little house
and had dated a few women in town, but he still dreamed of Jill.� Thinking back, he could remember every
mistake he had made, especially in the cabin.�
He would sometimes wonder if she would have gone with him if he had just
been able to control himself.� He had not
spoken to Nick at all and had lost track of him until he saw that he had been
arrested.� He would go in and see him one
day and try to see if he still had a brother.�


&nbsp;

He was talking to a prospective client on
the phone when he saw her. Her hair was shorter and a different colour, but it
was definitely her. She was looking at the houses for sale in the window, and
he finished his call as quickly as he could.�
Moving outside, he walked up behind her and lightly gripped her
elbow.� She gasped and turned to face
him, the eyes he remembered so well looking back at him. What surprised him was
her lack of surprise.

&nbsp;

�Hi Jill, you look good. I like the
hair.� Would you come inside and talk for
a while?�

&nbsp;

He expected her to say no, but when she
nodded he lead her in to sit on the couch they had for clients to sit on,
locking the door as she sat down.� She
looked up as she heard the door lock, the familiar fear in her eyes.

&nbsp;

�It is only so we don�t get interrupted, I
can open it again if you like.�� 

&nbsp;

When she shook her head, he sat down on the
chair opposite her, waiting for her tell him why she was here. Jill knew she
should not have come, but since knowing that Nick was out of the picture, she had
begun to think more about Tom.� She had
grown restless and decided to take a driving holiday and had almost crashed her
car when she saw Tom�s face smiling out at her from the back of a taxi.� It was an Ad for the real estate firm he was
working for and she thought it would help sell a lot of houses.� She had seen the estate agency as she drove
through town, but it had take her another two weeks before she found the
courage to confront him.� Now here she
was with Tom waiting for her to speak.

&nbsp;

�Tom I don�t really know why I am here, but
when I saw your face on that ad, I just knew that I would never be able to get
on with my life if I didn�t see you again. �

&nbsp;

Tom sat, letting her talk, his head
spinning with the fact that she was actually here and talking to him.� 

&nbsp;

�I have tried to forget everything that
happened, but when I saw Nick on the news it just brought it all back.� I have been travelling around the country
trying to find a new life, without much luck I might add.� So, you seem to have found a nice job here.�

&nbsp;

� Yeah, I don�t know if it is something I
would want to do forever, but it has kept me busy.� You will be pleased to know that been on the
straight and narrow since you saw me last.�

&nbsp;

They both sat in silence for a moment, the
memory of the last time they saw each other still fresh in their minds. Jill
was the first to speak, the emotion of the memory clear in her voice.

&nbsp;

�What you did was wrong, you do know
that.� Even though you didn�t hurt me,
you ruined any trust I did have.�

&nbsp;

�Jill, I know now that what you are saying
is true.� I am not giving you an excuse,
but I was so lost in the thought that I might never see you again and that it
was my last change to be close to you.��
I can see now I took advantage of you, and believe me, I have not been
coping too well with the guilt of what I did.��


&nbsp;

Jill could tell that he was telling her the
truth.

&nbsp;

�Have you seen Nick?�

&nbsp;

Tom, relieved that she had changed the
subject, told her that he hadn�t.� They
then talked for a while about things like his job and where she had been on her
driving holiday.

&nbsp;

�Jill, I need to ask you something. How
come you never told anyone what we did? I spent the first few months waiting
for the knock on the door, but when it didn�t come I just got on with
things.� 

&nbsp;

�I guess it was because I just wanted to
forget.� The thought of telling people
what had happened just made me feel ill.�
No one had even realised that I had been missing, as I have never been a
big one for keeping regular contact, even the guy whose house I was supposed to
be minding, just assumed I had flaked out on him. So I just made up some story
and tried to go on with my life.� 

&nbsp;

�I thought it was something like that.� Jill, I really messed up and I know this is
too little too late, but I just want you to know I am really sorry.�

&nbsp;

He saw her move to leave and had a moment
of panic, thinking he didn�t want her to go.�
Jill must have seen the look in his eyes, as he saw a flash of fear
there.� 

&nbsp;

�Jill, you do know that I could easily just
keep you here.� The door is locked and
no-one knows you are here.�

&nbsp;

He saw her look at him in apprehension and
then she simply stood up and walked to the door, patiently waiting for him to
let her out. Tom sighed and moved to the door to stand beside her.

&nbsp;

�I suppose you can�t blame me for trying,
can you?�

&nbsp;

Jill just stood and waited, finding that
she no longer had any feelings left for Tom at all.� He had helped her but he had also let her
down big time. She saw him open the door, his hand barring the entry out as he
turned to her.

&nbsp;

�Jill, I know it is just too late, but do
you think that if I not stuffed up so badly, that we could have had a chance?�

&nbsp;

Jill knew that she had spent many nights
over the last eighteen months wondering just that, but now found that she no
longer cared.

&nbsp;

�Tom, you are right, it is too late.� I need to go now�

&nbsp;

Jill walked past him, forcing him to drop
his hand from the door and walked down the street without looking back.� She felt free for the first time since that
awful day in the car park.� Free to live
her life without thinking of what could have been. She never even saw Tom
watching her walk away, a look of sadness in his eyes.� She could only see the bright future ahead of
her, the promise of a life free from the memories that had haunted her.� Yes, she decided, she had made the right
choice to see Tom again, as she had been able to see him as he really was, not
as she had wanted him to be.� She smiled,
thinking of all the things she could do. Life was good and she intended to make
the most of her second chance, no matter what life would throw at her.� After all, she was a survivor.� 

&nbsp;

The end
