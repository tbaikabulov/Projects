Synopsis: The dangers of replying to a contact add. And not necessarily that the person is not what claimed to be, rather when they are exactly that.






I knew I shouldn&#8217;t reply to the contact add, but I still did. Short and non descriptive; �sadistic lady seek toy for unusual captivity. You will not move.� That was all. And an email address, a pretty standard non descriptive email address. It was a week ago, that I saw it. Took me one week to figure out if and of course what I should write. About one hour later, I had her reply back. She thought I sounded sweet. Well, at least something, and a positive reply. A few emails later, she had promised me fear, like I never experienced before, as well as pain making me cry. I am not sure if it was a good idea, to admit to enjoying crying from the pain of a sadistic lady. 

We agreed to met at her place the next Friday. A house by a small lake, a little bit into the mountains. Must be a great resort in the winter for skiing. At the moment, it was summer, and more calm. Being a little bit early, I slowed down the last few km, and enjoyed the view. The alps can be a lovely place. And there it was, actually very close to the sea, and built over a small river running down from the mountain-tops. Rather old. Looked sort of like an old mill. Only building there, so it had to be it. Which reminded me, I had no idea who was awaiting me. We had emailed a few times, back and forth, and had spoken briefly on the phone She should be in her later 30ies. Long dark hair. Just 1.60 tall, and slightly curvy. Femininly shaped. But her voice. 

A very soft calm one, a little how a mother could talk to her child, except it was sensually loaded at the same time. The conversation we had, was not so much about the weekend, she just wanted to get to know me. Teasing me, with what she could do to me if I was a man. But as she had laughed, I was just her small toy for the weekend. That she had a descriptive and creative fantasy, that was at least clear. Which both made me look forward, and become scared. Was awaited me, was sort of a surprise. Not necessary a bad one, just a surprise. As I turned down before the house, a seemingly Philippino looking lady was standing there. Somehow I had imagined a white woman, being in northern Europe and all. 

She smiled at me, and directed where I could leave my car. I followed, parking parked, stepped out, and greeted her. And what I just had thought of as in what would be described as a old fashion carport.&nbsp; surprise, turned into a very pleasant one. She stood there in a short skirt and a tank top. Grinning at me; now, are you disappointed? I could not but say no, that I was pleasantly surprised and found her to be an attractive lady. She showed me inside, walking close behind me. We see how pleasant the surprise will turn out, she whispered, and let her hand gently stroke over my chest. Standing close next to her, breathing in her scent. 

The inside, looked nothing like the outside of the house. All modern, as we stepped inside. One room, combined kitchen and living room. Maybe just 3 meters wide, but long. All clean, simple and modern. Kept in white, stainless steel, and slightly green colored glass. Kitchen part, a dining table, and at the far end, behind a glass wall covering half the width, a coach facing the window and a small balcony outside. In the other direction, there was another room, which I could not really see. Bed room is upstairs, she explained, though, not that I would need to know, she smiled.. Looking around though, there was nothing that made me think of SM. 

She walks over to a coach by the window, casually signalling with her hand, that she expect me to kneel down before her. Even threw me a small pillow, laughing, a little comfort still, we have not yet begun. Lighting a cigarette, she ask me to remove my shirt. Letting her hand slide softly over my chest, I feel her warm soft skin. Nothing the reminds me of the sadist she claimed she was. Though, as she said, we had not yet begun. Pointing her cigarette at me, I open my mouth, and she ashes. She moves forward from her sitting position, her face next to mine, whispering to me; don&#8217;t swallow that yet. 

As she finishes the cigarette, my tongue is full with the ash, as well as pretty dry. Thankfully, she decide to use the more normal ashtray for the butt. A test of obedience, she claimed. Her voice, sensual, soft, low. Her moving towards me, every now and then, giving me the possibility to admire her face, light dark tan, red full lips, dark brown eyes. Bowing my head, was also not to bad, looking down into her cleavage. Must be 80D. Nice round, and in the tank top, you really did not have to leave much to the imagination. 

As she stands up, and well, she had to notice that I was staring at her bodily parts, she made sure to rub her ass to my face, softly commenting, you like what you see. How could one not, I thought to myself. Standing behind me, she gently direct me to step backwards. Guiding me with her, towards the wall. Not sure what was going to happen. Her hands gently touching my skin. Her nails, rather long, and perfectly polished, showed also to be razor sharp, as she let them move up and down. Small trails appearing on my skin. In a way painful, how her nails gently rips the surface, but also erotic, exciting me. 

Suddenly, I feel she pull a rope around my neck, and the ground under my feet vanishes. A mechanical something, that folded away under me. A second floor somewhere down there, that I could reach when I stood on my toes. And when I did not, the rope tightened around my neck. Her laughter remained soft and sensual, though clear that she enjoyed my predicament. I mean, she was the one placing me there. 

As she walks around me, I notice how far I did fall. The lady that earlier was a head shorter than me, was now slightly taller. I look at her with a what the fuck is this kind of look, she just smiled. Standing next to me, close, I could smell her perfume, her scent, as she bite my lip. Her hands holding my head. My hands holding around her. Seemingly, she did not mind, though, first when I could taste my own blood, did her teeth let go of my lip. 

You scared, she whispers in my ear. Nibbling on it. Nibbling? Actually biting. Standing on my toes like that was sort of hard and exhausting, and the rope around my neck rather tight. Was tempted to yell crazy bitch at her, and try to get out. Her rubbing her body against mine, sort of still made me follow her lead. Then the kiss. And boy could she kiss. If it was not for that I hung there with a rope around my neck, and she digging her nails all she could into my nipples, it would have been like a died and gone to heaven. Now it made me dizzy. And the harder she dug her nails into my skin, the more she pushed me down, the more I struggled to be able to stand. You like the kiss of the widow, she whispered into my ear, and landed a heavy knee to my balls. You might not survive, she smiled. 

Some time later, I got to myself again. Had passed out, no idea for how long. Still feeling dizzy, no wonder, and still the pain. The lip felt thick and swollen. Where were I? This was a different room. Walls and floor made from a light green colored tiles, though, designed in the same modern clean functional way. Above me, seemingly the shower, at the other end, a sink. Above me the shower, actually, above me, the lady, standing there, with a hose in her hands. Cleaning time, she smiles. We do not want you to make your captivity and contrapment dirty, do we. And if she made it painful for me just earlier, showering me, and cleaning me out, emptying me, she did with the softest touch. Carefully, thoroughly, gently. 

Clean, and empty, she signals that I should follow her back out again, to where she tried hanging me, just an hour earlier. Letting me again stand where I had earlier faced my predicament, she now shows her sensual side. A kiss as erotic as the earlier one, now without the rope around my neck. She grinding her body next to mind. It intensifies, her nails start to slide over my back, harder and harder. Looking at her, kissing her back, I hold around her. She pushes me downwards. Her hands on my head, directing it to her pussy. A very wet pussy. She lays down on the coach, me kneeling before her, eating her out. 

Was felt like an eternity, was probably a bit shorter, unfortunately. But her starting to nibble on my ear was also nothing but exciting. Her tongue, soft, warm, sensual. As her voice, whispering again; its time to wrap you up. Behind her, she points at a 3 meter long black flexible plastic tube. That I should get it, and place it on the floor before the coach. As I do, I also notice a hot air blower next to it. Wondering what she has in mind, I also start to get some ideas what it might be. And as the tube is placed on the floor, she tell me to crawl in. My slight hesitation, is handled with a kiss, causing my knees to grow weak again.

Inside, and she did very carefully measure, that I was in the middle, she turns on the hot air. The tube shrinking quickly around my body. Starting from my feet. The hot plastic burn slightly against my skin. Breathing becoming increasingly difficult, less and less air, and as I feel she folds the end above my head, I start to panic. Though as the plastic has cooled down, it has become increasingly rigid, and inflexible. Like inside of a large cocoon. Her laughter from outside, still manages to get through, as she watches me fight. 

To my rescue, comes a knife, as she slowly and carefully cuts a small hole above my mouth. Do not what you to die, just yet, she whispers. I feel her laying down on-top of me. Such a young handsome man, she whispers, and now transformed into a plastic toy. Feeling her biting on my lips again, I can not but become excited. The soft warm lips of her, the wet tongue as it plays inside my mouth. That I get no air, as long as she kisses me, is not really of importance. You might wonder what will happen to you, she whispers. I had planed to hunger you out in there, see how long you would survive, she states in a matter of fact way. But your tongue might have saved you. 

For a while she lays upon me, kissing, biting my lips. Time became difficult to tell. She moved away. She returned. She had a smoke, making sure that I inhaled what she breathed out. And she sat down over the opening, letting me lick her out. Time was difficult to tell. And then she was gone, with a gentle kiss, and the words good night. 

Sleeping, was not really a good option, though still a necessary one. And what must have been the next morning, was her voice waking me up. The rules, she explained. She would kiss me, let me eat her out, and use me as a sex object until I gave in and needed something to drink. The only option, was her pee, direct from the source. But from then, she would not kiss me anymore. Who would like to make out with a toilette, she claimed. I was not to spill a single drop, not speak, and unfortunately, eating was not really an option either. Not really being in a position I could disagree. She softly laughed. 

Her kisses, was still making it worth it. Soft, sensual, to wild and painful. Her laughter, when she noticed that I got excited. Claiming I was a naughty boy. Time was difficult to tell, as she was around me, and then away. Making sure she stepped on me every now and then, as she walked by. Then a noise, as I feel my legs get lifted. Within short, hanging upside down. And the impact. Knowing now, how she kept herself fit. A punching bag as she made her work out. The plastic tube being sort of stiff, did not really provide my protection as she practiced her kicks. Inside, shivering, sweating, and pretty soon whining, I tried to keep quiet. Not knowing when the next one would come, made them all the more painful. Hanging up side down, caused my head to get dizzy. All the blood wanting to be at one place. Her kicks, hitting my ribs, increasingly painful. 

Somewhere, I passed out again. From the pain, or from hanging upside down. Hungry, thirsty, I woke up, her lips next to mine, gently kissing me. The contrast in behaviour could not be greater. These, soft sensual kisses, was from the same lady who just tried to crush my ribs. The pain still there. She whispers, you thirsty, I close my mouth, to signal no. Not that I were not thirsty. It was more the fear. As long as I could manage, I swore I would say no to a drink. Time, difficult to tell. The add had said toy for unusual captivity. Was what I was experiencing. 

Somehow, she managed to get me outside. I mean, it was not that far, and from inside my cocoon, I can only assume it was outside. And outside, the balcony of her house, was just a few meters away from where she positioned me at first. A hot and sunny day. The cocoon left there, with no shade. Felt like in an oven. Time was difficult to tell. And if not having anything to drink the last day, I got even more thirsty. Laying there sweating, for what felt like for ever. Every now and then, I felt something which must be her toes over my mouth, knowing she must be near by. Her playing, taking my breath away for short instances. Hearing her laugh, knowing she must be enjoying her small games. 

My hurp and heavy breathing must have told her something. Being moved around, and seemingly back into an area where it was no direct sun, could feel the temperature difference. One finger of hers, on my lips. You know the rules, she said; no sounds, I must therefore punish you. Sitting down across my chest, I could feel she was cutting open around my whole face. Being able to see again, she was sitting over me, in her underwear and long black bathrobe. Hair looked like it was still wet. Must have taken a shower after her workout session earlier. Gently kissing me, she whispers, I like it, when my victim can see me before I smother them to death. She stands up next to me, with her full curves she do look hot and sexy. Starting to playing with herself, letting her hands rub her breast, over her crotch. Starting to breath faster. 

Looking up at her, I speak for the first time; please no. As she removes her underwear, she smiles softly; sorry my friend, but to late for pleading. Slowly she lowers herself over my face. My nose deep between her ass checks. Mouth under her pussy. Can not but open my mouth, starting to lick. She was so warm and wet. No more air, only a constant stream of her pee filling my mouth, making me struggle to swallow fast enough. The tight tube around my body might fighting her hard, impossible.
