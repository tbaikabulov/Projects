Cynthia&#8217;s First Time


I don&#8217;t really want to talk about how I lost my virginity, but it&#8217;s that or do an essay on my favorite childhood pet. Since I ran over Fluffy with the car learning to drive, that&#8217;s an even more painful memory. So here&#8217;s how it went.

I had a summer job at Duke McDougal&#8217;s Burger Heaven and was working a lot of hours. That day I got in at 11 to start the lunch shift, and wasn&#8217;t supposed to leave until 6. The first half hour was fine, but then I was called into Mr. Fischer&#8217;s office. He was the store owner and a really unpleasant fart. I found him on the phone with a stern look on his face. �She&#8217;s here,� he said to someone on the line.

�What is it, Mr. Fischer?� I asked nervously. I didn&#8217;t like the way he looked or sounded.

�Shut the door, Cynthia,� he said, and I did. �I&#8217;m on the line with the sheriff&#8217;s office, and they&#8217;ve told me that you are carrying drugs and stolen cash on you.�

�What? I never did drugs! I haven&#8217;t stolen anything. You have to believe me, sir!� This was horrible, and I felt a shiver running through me. I&#8217;d never been in trouble before. I had perfect grades and had just turned eighteen. I was about to graduate. This could mess up my admission to Yale.

�We&#8217;ll see about that,� Mr. Fischer said. �The police are busy right now, but they&#8217;ve instructed me to search you. I suggest you comply.�

�Yes, of course. My purse is in the employee room.�

�Never mind your purse for now,� he said, then returned to his phone call. �Can I put you on speaker phone, officer?� He listened, nodded, and then pushed the speaker button on the phone. �Cynthia, this is officer White.�

�You&#8217;ll need to do a complete strip search,� the voice on the line said, not even talking to me. Did he say strip search? Oh god! No!

�Alright.�

�Start with her shirt and her shoes,� White said.

�You&#8217;d better take them off, Cynthia,� Mr. Fischer said to me.

�Please, Mr. Fischer,� I said, with tears starting to roll down my eyes.

�Now, Cynthia!� he said, angrily and annoyed. I nearly jumped out of my shoes at his tone, but with fumbling fingers I unbuttoned my shirt, took it off, and put it on the desk. My shoes were easier, but I realized I had to bend over to untie them, giving my boss a look down my bra.

�Check and make sure she&#8217;s not hiding anything in either of them,� White said. �Search carefully.� Mr. Fischer thoroughly poked through my shirt pockets and took all the laces off my sneakers to check inside.

�Nothing here,� he said.

�I was afraid of that,� White said. �Is she wearing pants or a skirt?�

�She has jeans on,� Mr. Fischer said.

�Oh, that&#8217;s unfortunate. You&#8217;ll have to take them from her now, as well as any jewelry or other accessories.�

�Please, I don&#8217;t have any drugs on me!� I sobbed.

�You heard the officer,� Mr. Fischer said. �Get them off, now.�

I was trembling and sobbing as I pulled the jeans off, and handed over my earring and wristwatch. 

�Jeans have all kinds of thickly sewn, hidden places to hide things,� White said. �You&#8217;ll have to use a knife or a pair of scissors to cut through them in all the thickly stitched areas. Don&#8217;t be afraid to ruin them, she&#8217;ll get new clothes at the jailhouse.�

�No!� I cried. �You can&#8217;t do that! You can&#8217;t cut my clothes up! This isn&#8217;t how things are done!�

�Quiet down, girl!� White shouted through the phone. �You&#8217;re in enough trouble already. The squad car will be there soon enough, now don&#8217;t make it harder for yourself!�

I just stood there while Mr. Fischer used the box cutter to rip my jeans into thin shreds before my eyes. �Check her shirt, too,� White said. �Make sure there are no hidden compartments.�

�Oh no, no,� I wept as my shirt was also ruined.

�Does she have socks on?�

�Yes, she does.�

�Take them from her.�

�You heard him,� Mr. Fischer said to me. I had to bend over again and take my socks off. He checked through them.

�Still nothing,� he said to officer White.

�I was hoping it wouldn&#8217;t come to this,� White said. �We prefer uniformed officers for this. But you&#8217;ll have to take her panties and her bra away. Sometimes females will hide drugs or cash in there.�

�Oh, please. Don&#8217;t do this to me!� I sobbed, but it was hopeless. Mr. Fischer just made a motion with his finger, and I understood it perfectly. I had to finish stripping right in front of him. I couldn&#8217;t unfasten my bra at first. Finally, weeping like crazy, I had to turn around and let him do it for me. Sliding my underwear down my legs was easier, but now it left me utterly stark naked in the little office.

�There&#8217;s nothing in her clothes,� he said.

�Uh huh. Alright then. You&#8217;ll have to give her a cavity search then.� My eyes flew open wide at that thought, but just then there was a knock at the door.

�There&#8217;s a customer who wants to talk to you, sir,� came some employee&#8217;s voice from the hall outside.

�I&#8217;ll be right there,� he said loudly.

�Sir, I must ask that the suspect not be left alone,� White said. �Is there someone else there to watch her?�

�Hold on,� he said. He slid the door open and looked outside. �Harold, go tell Jack I need him in here.� He sat back down. �My son works here. He&#8217;ll watch her. We&#8217;re going into the lunch rush here, so I&#8217;m fairly busy.�

�That will be fine,� White said. I thought my stomach really would come up my throat at that. Jack Fischer was in my grade at school, though not often in my classes. He was in the loser classes. He poked his head in a few moments later, took one look at me standing there start naked, and his jaw nearly dropped. 

�Holy hot shit!� he said.

�Jack, there&#8217;s an officer White on the line with the sheriff&#8217;s department. Cynthia is accused of possessing stolen money and drugs. Do whatever he tells you with her.�

�God I&#8217;m glad I took this job!� Jack said as Mr. Fischer walked out, closing the door behind him. �Sooo, Cynthia, fancy seeing you like this,� he said, leering all over me. I wanted to just crawl away and die.

�Alright, Jack Fischer was it?� White asked.

�Yes, sir, officer,� Jack said. �What should I do with the perp?�

�You&#8217;ll need to do a full body cavity search. Start with the mouth.�

�Um, how do I do that?�

�Just look. Girl, you need to open your mouth up wide now so this young man can check for drugs.�

He actually addressed me as girl! What kind of department were they running? But I had to open my mouth up wide while Jack took a flashlight and looked inside my mouth. �Make sure she lifts her tongue up.� I didn&#8217;t wait to be told. I just did it. I just wanted this all to be over.

�Nothing there.�

�That&#8217;s not surprising. Okay, next you&#8217;ll have to do a vaginal search. Have her sit on the desk or a counter surface. You sit on a chair between her legs and make sure she spreads them wide. Then we&#8217;ll get started.�

�You heard him, Cynthia,� Jack said lewdly at me. �Hop up and spread &#8216;em!�

I was still crying, but didn&#8217;t bother protesting. I positioned myself and clutched my eyes shut as I parted my legs for him. I felt his cold fingers poking at my vagina, rubbing my clitoris. No one had ever touched me there! I gasped at that.

�Ready,� Jack said.

�Now insert two fingers into her vagina as far as you can. Rotate them about and feel along her insides. Is there any sign of plastic compartments hidden in there that you can feel?�

I winced and groaned at the painful intrusion. I tried to pull back, but my back was already against the wall and there was no place to go.

�Don&#8217;t feel nothing,� Jack said. �But give me a minute to be sure.�

�Take your time,� officer White said. �We need to be thorough.�

Jack continued fondling me, stroking me, and even pinching at me making me cry out in pain. �Check all her folds,� White said.

�There&#8217;s nothing there,� Jack finally said after a few minutes.

�She may have placed them deeper. Is there a long, narrow object you can insert up into her further?�

�Someone left a serving spoon here,� Jack said. �It&#8217;s got a long, thin, flat handle.�

�Perfect. Okay, son, I want you to insert the handle all the way into her vagina. Don&#8217;t stop until you can&#8217;t push any further.�

�Alright. Here goes,� Jack said. I felt the cold metal sliding into me and grimaced. It was horrible, and I felt a painful pressure inside me.

�It didn&#8217;t go in that far,� Jack said, prodding.

�Is the girl a virgin?� White asked.

�Well?� Jack asked, poking my insides with the spoon handle. I nodded my head quickly, too ashamed to speak.

�Yeah, she is.�

�Okay, she may have hidden the goods past her hymen. You&#8217;ll have to just push through it, alright?�

�Can do,� Jack said. He have the spoon a hard shove. I screamed in pain as it tore me and continued up. I looked down and was vaguely nauseated seeing just the head of the big spoon sticking out of me. He had most of it jammed into me until I felt a pressure deep within me.

�Rotate the handle around. Twist it a lot. Try to dislodge anything that might me up in there. Take your time.�

�Owww!� I cried, trying to push his hands away as he began jerking the handle around in me.

�Hey!� Jack shouted. �She&#8217;s resisting, sir. Repeat, perp is resisting!�

�Stop twisting for now,� White said. �You&#8217;ll have to restrain her. Is there any duct tape in the office?�

�Sure.�

�Okay, have her cross her wrists behind her back. Tape around them thoroughly.

�No!� I sobbed. �You can&#8217;t do this!�

�Do you want to be charged with resisting?� White shouted at me. �Cooperate!�

I almost felt numb. I could tell that I was losing sensation in my body. But I put my hands behind me as ordered. Jack taped them, wrapping the tape in all directions around my wrist. He must have put four feet of tape on me. My hands were thoroughly bound.

�She&#8217;s done,� Jack said.

�Good, now resume the search.� I just sat there, whimpering in pain as Jack used the spoon handle to maul my vagina. He just kept at it again and again.

�I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything in there,� Jack said.

�Alright, take the spoon out.�

�Ew!� Jack said as he pulled the bloody handle out.

�If she&#8217;s dirty, you might have to clean her. Is there a sink nearby?�

�Sure, man. It&#8217;s a restaurant. There&#8217;s a sink in every room. There&#8217;s a sponge brush here, too.�

�Good. Excellent. Soak it and push it into her vagina. We&#8217;ve got to clean her up.�

Jack ran cold water onto the sponge on a stick. Then he pushed it deep into my vagina and rubbed it around. �Just repeat until there&#8217;s no more blood,� White said. So Jack did that. He spent the next twenty minutes cleaning me out.

�There&#8217;s still a chance she had contraband hidden up inside herself,� White said. �Have her stand up and jump up and down.�

�Do it,� Jack ordered me. I didn&#8217;t know if my legs would hold out. I was shaking and weak, but I began jumping, making little hops.

�She&#8217;s kind of hopping a bit,� Jack said.

�Not good enough. Make her spread her legs apart and do huge leaps. You might have to coerce her.�

�I&#8217;ve got it,� he said. He picked up a fork and waved it in front of me. �Go ahead, Cynthia, spread &#8216;em and jump like you mean it!�

�Please, Jack, don&#8217;t,� I&nbsp; begged. He quickly jabbed at my right breast with the fort. I yelped in pain and began jumping as ordered while Jack described how he made me comply.

�That&#8217;s excellent thinking,� White said.

�How long&#8217;s she got to jump around like this?�

�Maybe just a few minutes, but it could take as long as forty five minutes. Do you have time?�

�Sure, dad left me in charge of her.�

So I stood there, legs wide, hands taped, jumping for all I was worth. Jack and officer White made small talk about football a bit, and Jack must have jabbed me twenty times on my breasts when I slowed down. My legs were burning.

It was past 2 when the door to the office opened and one of the employees poked his head in. It was Josh Palmer, another boy from school. �Hey, Jack, have you whoa momma!� he said, seeing me.

�Who&#8217;s that?� White asked.

�Josh, he&#8217;s okay,� Jack said. �I know him from school.�

�What&#8217;s going on?� Josh asked.

�Cynthia here&#8217;s a drug dealer and a thief,� Jack said.

�I&#8217;m not,� I murmured quietly. �Please somebody believe me! It&#8217;s all a mix up!�

�Good, I&#8217;m glad another employee is there,� White said. �She may have stolen from the other workers at the store. If so, they&#8217;ll want to check her themselves. Josh, can you ask around and let them know that Cynthia is a known thief?�

�Sure thing,� Josh said, hurrying out, though not in such a hurry that he didn&#8217;t almost slam the door on his head lingering to look at me.

�She can stop jumping now,� White said. I finally stopped, but had to remain standing there while Jack sat back in the reclining office chair, watching me over.

�What&#8217;s next?�

�I&#8217;m afraid her oral search wasn&#8217;t thorough enough,� White said. �She may have items lodged deeper than you could easily see.�

�Should I get the spoon?� Jack asked.

�No, no. That might injure her. Do you have anything there six to eight inches long that&#8217;s firm but doesn&#8217;t have a hard surface?�

�Um, let me look around,� Jack said. A few seconds later he had to stifle a burst of laughter.

�What is it?� White asked.

�Well, I thought of something, but, you know, I can&#8217;t use it like this.�

�What are you... Oh. Yes. Well, if you can&#8217;t find something else, you might have to.�

�Yeah, right. Really? Wait, no kidding? No way.�

�Trust me, son, I&#8217;m an officer of the law. If you can&#8217;t find something else, I&#8217;ll give you special permission. It&#8217;s your civic duty, even.�

What on earth were they talking about now? I was terrified. I didn&#8217;t like the sound of their voices at all now, and Jack was staring at me with new lust in his eyes.

�I&#8217;m pretty sure there&#8217;s nothing here I can use,� Jack said.

�Alright, go ahead and probe her with your penis, then.�

What! I tried to back away. My tears, which had stopped, now came flowing out again. But he was between me and the door, and besides, I was naked and bound. Jack unzipped his fly and pulled his penis out. It just sat there, but it was stirring.

�Get over here on your knees, Cynthia!� he snapped.

�Do it, girl,� White ordered. I was so weak and landed hard and painfully on my knees, but I waddled over to between his legs.

�Put it in your mouth and start licking it,� Jack said, grabbing me by my hair and pulling me towards him. �The sooner you start, the sooner you&#8217;ll be done.�

I was crying openly and hysterically even by then, but I put it in my mouth. It tasted of funky sweat, but it was soon very hard. Now he continued grabbing my hair and thrusting himself in and out of me. I gagged when it touched the back of my throat, trying to pull away, but I had no leverage and he held me firm.

�Oh yeah,� Jack moaned. �That&#8217;s right.�

�Anything in there?� White asked.

�Heaven,� Jack said slowly. I was shaking, trying to pull free, sobbing crazily, and that&#8217;s when the door opened. Josh and four other men were there, staring in.

�Shit, man!� Josh said.

�Officer said so,� Jack gasped. Then he stiffened up and suddenly he began peeing in my mouth. But it wasn&#8217;t pee. It was hot and salty and sticky. It was semen, of course. I coughed and gagged and sputtered. He finally pulled my head away. His semen was in my mouth! And a lot of it was dripping down my chin and onto my breasts. I stared up at the guys through tear stained eyes.

�Are there more people there?� White asked.

�Yeah, man, there&#8217;s four of us here,� Josh answered.

�Okay, you might all be victims of Cynthia&#8217;s theft. You might all want to be in on this.�

They tried to hustle into the room, but there wasn&#8217;t space. �Hey, officer sir, can we do this in the break room? There&#8217;s no space in here. We can transfer your call there.�

�Sure, go ahead,� White replied. Hands grabbed me and pulled me to my feet. They marched me into the hallway. I saw on a wall clock that it was well past three now. They got me to the break room and threw me down on the ratty old couch. The call was reestablished. �Listen, everyone, our efforts to find Cynthia&#8217;s stolen goods have failed, and nor has she confessed. It will save everyone a lot of time if you can coax a confession from her. Just keep me on the line and informed of what&#8217;s going on. You have permission to act as you see fit. When the squad car does arrive, you&#8217;ll have helped the investigation tremendously.�

My fear was never greater than when he said that. It was like a floodgate opening. There were now five guys on top of me, pinching me, slapping me, even punching me a few times. They kept shouting �Confess!�

Which I did, finally. I tried to. �I confess!� I sobbed loudly. �I stole. The drugs are mine. Stop it!� They didn&#8217;t care. It took all of ten minutes for them to begin raping me in my vagina, all the while shouting at me to confess my crimes. One of them, an older man named Tom, was absolutely brutal in twisting my breasts around. I thought he would pull them off. 

It didn&#8217;t take long for other guys there to figure out what was going on. Sometime after five I realized that the naked man with his penis in me was Mr. Fischer himself. The assistant manager, Harry Bergowitz, was the first to discover that he could hit me repeatedly with his belt. That realization came at six thirty. At seven he figured out he could swing the end with the buckle on it at me. I can&#8217;t give more detail about these hours because it was a blur. I was crying all the time. It was unreal, and I felt detached from my body, but not nearly detached enough.

But worse was still to come. Someone, Jack maybe, came bursting in at 8 in the evening to announce that a customer had lost a wallet. All eyes turned to me. I couldn&#8217;t believe they still thought I was guilty!

�This is very serious,� officer White said. He&#8217;d been on the line the whole time. �Are there many people in the dining room?�

�Just a few truckers, a businessman, and a couple other men,� Mr. Fischer replied.

�Alright, I want you to take Cynthia out to the dining room. Lay her down on a couple tables if you have to. See if anyone there remembers her stealing anything from them.

They picked me up and carried me through the air to the dining room. I was mortified. The businessman was apparently the man who lost his wallet. As soon as he saw us coming he put his cell phone down without hanging it up and walked over to me.

�Yes, this is her, she was standing close to me this morning when I was in here,� he said, his voice sounding familiar to me. �Where&#8217;s my wallet, bitch! Where the fuck is it?� He slapped me hard across my face, then grabbed my left breast and squeezed it, hard.

�I don&#8217;t know!� I weakly sobbed.

�I want to search her. I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s alright with officer White,� he said. They had placed me on two tables. Now he grabbed at my crotch, parting me with his fingers and poking around. �Yes, I see she&#8217;s quite bruised and blistered now,� he said. He even pinched a blister on the inside of my vagina, popping it open and making me shriek loudly in agony. Then he suddenly rammed his entire hand into me and began groping and scratching at my insides. That was when I fainted away.

I awoke probably only a minute later. They were getting ready for another gang rape on me, and the businessman was first. He plunged his large penis into me. Another one went into my mouth. Mr. Fischer was going around closing the blinds on the open glass windows and putting the closed sign on the door. It took me a moment to realize that a third penis was pressing at my anus.

How could they do that!

But they did. I had never imagined such things, but now I had three of those things inside me, pumping and pushing. I cried and struggled and got nowhere. My hands were still taped from hours earlier.

The attack didn&#8217;t end even when the tables fell over, dropping me onto the hard floor with several men on top of me. They just moved me to a booth and continued.

At eleven thirty or so, twelve hours into my ordeal, they were all still at it except the angry businessman, who was taking a bathroom break. Unlike the truckers and several of the staff, he didn&#8217;t seem to want to pee on my face. Jack came running in with the cordless phone. �Hey, dad, officer White wants to speak to us.�

Mr. Fischer put the cordless receiver on speaker phone. Everyone stopped to listen.

�Alright, I&#8217;m sorry to have to tell you this. You were all very helpful today. But the department has recovered the drugs and the money from a different person. So it seems that Cynthia is innocent. Don&#8217;t worry, though. The department recognizes that you were acting within the law with your enhanced interrogation. I suggest letting the girl go, now, though.�

The whole room was deflated then, except me. I just wanted to die. I was lying on the floor, covered in cum and some pee, and my own blood. One of them quietly cut the tape from my hands and they helped me up.

�Sorry about that, Cynthia,� Mr. Fischer said. Someone handed me my purse. They couldn&#8217;t find my clothes anywhere.

I stumbled to the door, and was opening it when Mr. Fischer grabbed it and pulled it shut again. �Listen, Cynthia, we&#8217;re not mad, but perhaps you should find another place to work in the future. I think your presence here would be disruptive.�

I just stumbled out to the parking lot. It was a cool evening, making my fluid stained body chilled. My head was racing. It was unbelievable what had happened to me. And as I got to the back of the parking lot, I saw that my car was missing. It was towed or stolen. I didn&#8217;t know which. I had my car keys, but no car. I also had no cell phone. Turning back to the restaurant, I saw them locking the door. How was I ever to get home like this? That&#8217;s another story, though. The story of my second time.

Naturally I pressed charges. Or I tried to. It turned out there was no officer White with the sheriff&#8217;s department. In fact, our county doesn&#8217;t have a sheriff. All law enforcement is municipally based. We couldn&#8217;t identify the customers, but I named all the employees there that day. My parents hired a good but expensive lawyer. 

The defense attorneys played the video surveillance tape to the jury, and pointed out that when Jack first fingered my clitoris I had briefly smiled. That was all the convincing they needed that the sex was consensual. Everyone was acquitted, and the tape became an internet sensation.

Anyway, that&#8217;s how I lost my virginity when I was eighteen.
