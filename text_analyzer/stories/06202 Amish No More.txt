Amish No More

March 2008



I have been watching her for the past year, planning; learning her habits and schedule: Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, her brother drove her into town to sell their baked goods.&nbsp; Everything she sold was homemade and delicious.
During the week, he worked at Shultz's Saw Mill.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sarah rented a small booth in a co-op located in a run down strip mall. 
I had plans for that little cunt; all women are cunts to varying degrees. 

I should know, I was married to the ultimate one for 10 years; then the bitch filed for divorce.&nbsp; The cunt took half of everything we owned; at least what she and her attorney could find; lets just say most of my money was hidden in my mattress.&nbsp; 

I know better now, I am older and wiser; I will never marry again.&nbsp; I will get a young innocent woman and mold her to my preferences and carnal desires; break her will, isolate her; make her my slave. Sarah Bontrager would soon be mine.&nbsp; When I was done with her, she could never go back to her old way of life and would have no real place in the modern world: just my world.&nbsp; Tonight when her brother gets out of work, he will find his truck with four flat tires, the result of slow leaks, compliments of a valve stem tool.&nbsp; 

The telephone line to the strip mall will be disabled.&nbsp; Sarah will be taken after dark when she goes out back to the dumpster. 

I parked my truck at the back of the parking lot out of sight and folded the rear seat in the up position.&nbsp; The parking lot in the old strip mall was full of potholes and broken asphalt.&nbsp; The lighting in the back parking lot was terrible; most of the lights were out, those that were working, taken out.&nbsp; I stood in a dark corner and waited.&nbsp; 

Sarah lifted the cover to the dumpster and I quietly stepped behind her, putting my gloved had over her mouth, pressing the trigger on the taser; 750,000 volts of electric pulses, dumped directly into her central nervous system, disrupting her neurological impulses; causing a loss of balance and muscle control.&nbsp;&nbsp; I eased her to the ground, placing a ball gag in her mouth and securing her wrists behind her back, then her ankles with plastic Flexi -cuffs, ending with a red silk scarf for a blindfold.&nbsp; 

I carried Sarah to the truck and put her on the floor behind the front seat, " I have a present for you Princess."&nbsp; I said, putting a red leather dog collar with an attached brass nameplate around her neck; securing the collar to the trucks tie-down with a short training leash; the nameplate engraved with her new slave name: "Princess".

We had a two-hour drive ahead of us and I took all of the secondary and back roads to avoid traffic.&nbsp; After fifteen minutes on the road the affects of the taser started wearing off; Sarah started struggling in the back trying to scream through her gag.
 " Behave my pretty girl.... be quiet; you can't get loose and nobody can hear you."&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have a long drive to your new home."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I had Princess engraved on your new collar."&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you like my present little lady?"&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you familiar with the origin of your name, Sarah?"&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is Hebrew for lady or princess."&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very fitting, don't you think, Sarah, my little slave princess."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you listen to music Princess?" 
"By good music, I mean Classical of course; I have an extensive collection. "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My ex -cunt of a wife would rather watch television, the fat pig that she is."&nbsp; " She knew I loved to go dancing and never showed an interest after we were married."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My mother was a dance teacher; my favorite style is ballroom, so elegant.... so refined; you will learn to dance and appreciate good music."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't care if it is against your religion, good people all over the world dance; that is not an exclusive ticket to hell."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Do you like to read?"&nbsp; " I have an extensive library...."&nbsp; "Did you know that the ancient Greeks and Romans prized educated slaves?"&nbsp; "I hate stupid women like my ex-wife; she never even read one of my books." " You want to know something else, she hated to travel." "You are going to learn to love it."&nbsp; " That soap opera watching cunt: good riddance!"  I selected two CD's: Vivaldi's Four Seasons &amp; Handel's Messiah for us to listen to on the long ride home.
I pulled the truck into the garage then closed and locked the door.&nbsp; I got her out of truck and helped her to her feet, using the leash and collar for control.&nbsp; I cut the flexi-cuffs binding her ankles and walked her down the cellar stairs to the training room; never having done this before, I had no idea how long it would take to break her.&nbsp; Fortunately I did have some contacts that were experienced Dominants in such matters. 
Minerva for one, Minerva is my mentor and confidant. After my divorce, I went to her dance studio looking to brush up on my skills; we ended up as dance partners and have entered and won dance competitions together.&nbsp; We are not compatible as steady lovers; we continue to dance together; Minerva introduced me to the community.
I installed an immovable steel pole of my design in the middle of the floor.&nbsp; I made Princess stand with her back to it, attaching the short leash on the fixed rings at the top with a locking carabiner.&nbsp; There are three movable steel rings that will slide up and down the pole; I slid one of these rings to her wrists and attached another locking carabiner to the flexi-cuffs; she could not sit or lie down unless I removed her leash.&nbsp; 
Taking her face firmly in my hands, I said " I am going to take your gag off now, you can scream all you want; the basement has been sound proofed." " I will be back in 18 hours; after that, talking without permission will be severely punished." I warned, kissing her mouth and removing her bonnet. 
Princess was quiet for about an hour, then the pleading, screaming and questions began; of course, I could not hear or see her unless I switched on the lights and video cameras; the frosted block glass windows I installed were covered on the outside to block out all light. When the screaming began, I telephoned Minerva then watched Sarah on the monitor for a time; afterwards, I went to bed.
When I woke up, Minerva was waiting for me in the kitchen drinking coffee and watching Princess on the monitor.&nbsp; I poured myself a cup and sat down next to her. "I brought bagels and pea bacon, I was waiting for you to eat; if you cook, I'll do the dishes. "I want one of those poles," she stated, staring at the screen.&nbsp; " I would have never thought of using caribiners that way."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After we eat, you go downstairs alone, as we discussed; I will stay here and watch." she said, getting up, kissing my mouth. Pouring herself another cup of coffee, she sat back down to watch the monitor, pressing the zoom key. &nbsp; 
"Your Princess is very pretty, I approve."
I went downstairs to check on my little slave girl. In her dark gray knee length dress, white stockings and black sensible shoes, she reminded me of a scared little mouse.... but a cute little mouse.&nbsp; It was now time to unwrap the package and examine the contents.&nbsp; "Please, I.... I can't hold it anymore."&nbsp; "I have to go to the bathroom, please.... oh God, please help me." she cried, squirming at her bonds.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Ignoring her pleading, I removed her shoes and stockings.&nbsp; Next, I cut off her dress with a pair of scissors; followed by her bra and panties.&nbsp; I placed the scissors on one of her nipples, closing the blades just enough to pinch.&nbsp; Sarah stopped squirming and become quiet.&nbsp; 
"Be silent Princess, you were warned about speaking without permission; shall I cut it off?"&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have permission to speak."&nbsp; "Please...why are you doing this to me. "&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you?" I...."Wrong answer."&nbsp; I said calmly, increasing the tension on her nipple; her urine running down her legs; tears were running down her face in shame and fear.
"Please, I am begging you, don't cut it off!"&nbsp; She pleaded&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please, don't cut off my nipple.... Master."&nbsp; I said, correcting her, increasing the pressure.... "Please, don't cut off my nipple Master." "I am begging you Master, I will be good." You will be a good what? I asked, "I will be a good little slave Master," "Much better, but you still have to be punished." I replied, removing the scissors from her nipple.&nbsp; "Tell me again who I am, little Princess."&nbsp; I whispered, putting my face close, kissing her mouth again, the cold steel of the scissors, touching her vagina.
"You are my Master, I am your slave."&nbsp; "I am your property."&nbsp; " Please don't cut me Master," She whispered.&nbsp; "I will be lenient with you this one time."&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will receive a lesser punishment," I advised her, removing her leash.&nbsp; "Get down on the floor on your knee's."&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lets just see how long your hair is shall we." &nbsp; 
I removed the hairpins from her braided bun letting her braid drop down her back. Sarah's hair and braid was dark brown, very thick and soft, ending just below her round buttocks. What a shame I had to cut her beautiful hair, it will take years to grow that long again. "How shall I punish you Princess, shall I cut off your Labia Majora; your cunt lips?"&nbsp;&nbsp; "You still have permission to speak." "What shall your punishment be?"&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please cut my hair Master."&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know why you are being punished little lady?" 
"Because I spoke without permission after I was warned not to," she answered&nbsp;  "What else Princess?"&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I deserve to be punished for disobeying you Master."&nbsp; "That is correct, what you say is true; you are not a stupid girl, as I said before; I hate stupid women." What is your purpose in life now little my pretty little slave." "To please and serve you Master." 
 I removed the last carabiner, releasing her from the pole, and cut the flexi-cuffs on her wrists. "Do not remove your blindfold."&nbsp; "Get down on your hands and knees." "Put your legs together."&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please cut my hair, don't hurt me, don't cut me Master," she begged.
"Good girl."&nbsp;&nbsp; "Put your hands closer together and lean forward until your cunt is higher then your pretty little head; wonderful, now put your forehead on your hands."&nbsp; "You are a pretty little thing...say it." I ordered, gently stroking her nipples, watching them get hard.  
"I'm a pretty little thing."  She replied, her face and neck turning pink behind the blindfold.  "When ever I walk into a room, you will always get into this position."&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you understand?"&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes Master, I understand."&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your nipples are getting hard, my pretty girl." "You have beautiful breasts." "You obviously enjoy having them stroked."
"If I say down, you will assume this position."&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your slave understands, Master,"&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I say heel, what does it mean?"
"I am not sure, Master." she replied,&nbsp; "Guess?" I ordered.&nbsp; "I will kneel with my back straight."&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good answer; heel...stand." "Excellent, you are a natural."&nbsp; "Along with your punishment, you will receive a reward; I have decided not to shave your head.... for now."&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do that with all stupid disobedient girls who do not immediately submit and comply."&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Turn around, it is time for your haircut."&nbsp; I took the scissors and positioned them just below Sarah's shoulder blades. I slowly cut through her silky braid savoring the moment, putting the severed braid in my belt. 
"Turn and face me."&nbsp; "Unbraid your hair and finger comb your ponytail."&nbsp; "Do you have anything to say to me Princess?"&nbsp; I said stroking her ponytail. "Thank you for not shaving me bald Master."&nbsp;  I removed her blindfold and took her hair out of the ponytail, fluffing it out. Sarah's hair was now much shorter; it just touched the top of her breasts.&nbsp; 
"We are starting over, you may not speak!" I said, squeezing her ass cheeks, spreading her pussy lips, my fingers probing her flower; enjoying her wetness, and arousal. "Your heart beat and breathing have increased, your sex betrays you." 
 "Since you urinated on my floor, you will scrub the entire floor on your hands and knees."&nbsp; "You will use your Amish garments for cleaning rags."&nbsp; "If I am pleased with the floor, I may feed you."&nbsp; "I am expecting a guest, Mistress Minerva."&nbsp; "She is a slave owner and my equal."&nbsp; "You will address her as Mistress, and obey her commands."&nbsp; 
"Mistress Minerva will be assisting me in your training and grooming."&nbsp; "If she were your owner, and you urinated on her floor, you would be mopping the floor with your hair; then she would shave your head."&nbsp; "Mistress Minerva is very interested in purchasing you; she is a very wealthy, refined woman, but a cruel mistress." "If you continue to please me, I may keep you, my pretty girl."
"There is a slop sink and cleaning supplies in the closet," I said pointing to the door.&nbsp; "There is no hot water, just cold; you will have to earn the privilege to bath in hot water." "There is a blanket in the closet for you to sleep on when you are done." "You will also find the necessary toiletries to keep clean." "Your hair will always remain unbound."&nbsp; "I'm going upstairs to await my guest, get busy!"

I locked the door at the top and bottom of the stairs and walked to the kitchen.&nbsp; "Very well done Michael, I was convinced you really were going to cut her nipple off."&nbsp;&nbsp; "She must have been terrified."&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe she will be most compliant from this point on."&nbsp; "Such repressed sexuality just under the surface ready to be brought out."&nbsp; "I realize that Minerva, did you see how easily
she is aroused,"&nbsp; 

"Conditioned response will be one key to her submission,"&nbsp; "I intend to have her begging for my touch to avoid your punishments."&nbsp; "I will be her protector as well as her Master."&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe that will work with her Michael."&nbsp; "If your theory
pans out and you are successful, you will eligible for membership to the Sanctorum."&nbsp; "I'll wait for you in your bedroom; it's my turn to be on top my dear; watching you with her has made me horny as hell."&nbsp; 

After we made love we took a long nap, then it was my turn to be on top and we did it again; Minerva was just couldn't seem to get enough for some reason. Perhaps it was because she was looking forward in playing the heavy; good Master, bad 
Mistress.&nbsp; Minerva possessed a wonderful sense of style and knew how to dress.&nbsp; 

She was a very beautiful woman; a natural redhead with long thick hair that fell to the middle of her back. At six-two, Minerva had the slim graceful figure of a dancer and creamy complexion.&nbsp; Minerva owned two women that lived in small apartment, located in the same building as her studio.&nbsp; 

They were also her employees and she received an income from their labor. One of her girls was a registered nurse/ physician's assistant; the other a hairstylist/make up artist in a high end salon that Minerva owned, which incidentally employed a dozen ordinary people; they had no idea that their employer was Minerva's slave.&nbsp; 

Minerva's slave girls were former dance students with signed slave contracts, registered with the Sanctorum; they were bound for life and their contracts could be sold or transferred to other members. My plans for Princess were eventually to share my bed; that being primary; a companion/ housekeeper, secondary.&nbsp; 

The Sanctorum was a very old secret society; membership was for life, disclosing its secrets: by slaves or slave owners, depending on the severity could mean death.&nbsp; Minerva told me it had its own courts as well as a ruling council.&nbsp; The Sanctorum is a self-sustaining entity with members throughout the country. The Sanctorum has unbelievable financial resources at its disposal. They insured that registered slaves receive housing and medical care for life. 

Minerva went into the bathroom to change into what she called her "Mistress Attire" in preparation to train Princess: black silk blouse, black slacks and of course black riding boots.&nbsp; She fixed her long red hair in a ponytail.&nbsp; Minerva came out of the bathroom with the black leather-riding crop and announced&nbsp; "Let me at that little slut."

When we arrived in the basement, we found Princess asleep on the spotless floor by her training pole wrapped in her blanket.
Minerva wasted no time and struck the floor with the riding crop near Sarah's head. "Wake up slut, is this how you greet
your Master's guests?"  Princess woke with a start, throwing her blanket side, assumed the position.&nbsp; 

"Michael you described her to me as being very pretty."&nbsp; "Well, I suppose that is a matter of taste, I think her rather plain myself, barley adequate."

I watched Princess tense at these harsh words, but she knew enough to remain silent and hold position. "Just look at her fat hairy legs?" "Do Amish men actually find that attractive?" "What a dog she is." Minerva said laughing.&nbsp; I walked over to where Minerva was standing and quietly said Heel Princess, look at your Master." &nbsp;&nbsp; 

 I pushed her hair away from her face and looked into her brown eyes brimming with tears. I wiped them away and smiled at her.&nbsp; "I think she is very pretty, Minerva."&nbsp; " Of course you have complete charge of her grooming and make-up."&nbsp; "These are things that she has to learn having been brought up Amish." I added, stroking her hair.&nbsp; "You will wax your legs my pretty girl."&nbsp; "Mistress Minerva will teach you to enhance your natural beauty for men's pleasure."&nbsp; "You have permission to speak, but only to answer questions."

"What does your collar say slut?" Minerva asked&nbsp; "My Master says he engraved the nameplate with my slave name: Princess"
 Sarah replied.&nbsp; "Sarah's name in Hebrew translates as Lady or Princess."  I added&nbsp; "Do you know what else is engraved on your collar, slut?' Minerva asked  "No Mistress."&nbsp; "It says Princess, property of Master Michael."&nbsp; "Lady and Princess are also common names for hairy bitch dogs like you." Minerva said laughing.&nbsp; 

"When I own you, I will shave you completely bald and keep you that way." " That will be so delicious, my own hairless bitch." "Do you know what electrolysis is bitch?"&nbsp; "No Mistress."&nbsp; "It is a method of permanent hair removal making you permanently bald." Minerva answered, watching Sarah shudder.&nbsp; 

"You do not own her yet, Minerva." "For now I will choose her hairstyle, not you." "Your hairstylist Mandy will cut her hair to suit my taste; that was our agreement."&nbsp; I said raising my voice, pretending to be angry. 

"Yes of course, lover. "Minerva said, soothingly "There is no need to be angry." she said, kissing me.&nbsp; "She is just a slave after all."&nbsp; "I will abide by our agreement, but my methods are my own."&nbsp; "I suggest we go upstairs where can discuss this in private............................."

Once upstairs, while I opened a bottle of Dunnewood Merlot 2001(California), Minerva fixed a platter of cheese and fruit. "A toast to Minerva, your performance could have won an award, but you will have to settle for this fine Merlot." I announced raising my glass in salute. Minerva bowed and smiled taking a sip from her glass.&nbsp; 

"I was watching her reactions very closely."&nbsp; "Princess obviously thinks herself pretty, conformity to look and act the same, as opposed to individuality is encouraged in the Amish culture; particularly for women."&nbsp; "I observed her for a year before I abducted her."&nbsp; "When she thought no one was looking, she studied the young women buying her baked goods."&nbsp; 

"Did I tell you that she hid a small mirror in her booth, as well as fashion magazines in the ladies room vanity."&nbsp;&nbsp; "How could you possibly know that Michael, about the fashion magazines?"&nbsp; "Because I installed a hidden fiber optic camera in the ladies room."&nbsp; "Princess particularly likes the pictures of handsome young men."&nbsp; 

"I have her on video, masturbating; the magazines her visual aid."&nbsp; "I have still pictures taken from the videos to send to the Elders in her community; a threat to insure her obedience and compliance."&nbsp; 

"You naughty voyeur, you never told me about that!" She laughed, leaning forward; unconsciously touching herself, one of her many tells.&nbsp; I knew that she was getting aroused...I would make her wait this time.&nbsp; "I was saving that as a surprise my marvelous teacher." I said, refreshing her glass, my hand lingering on hers. 

I did show her the deference she was due; Minerva had influence in the Sanctorum.&nbsp; 

"Did you watch other women as well?"&nbsp; "Of course not Minerva, it was strictly business, I couldn't allow myself distractions."

"I had to make sure that Princess was the one." I stated.&nbsp; "Don't be so serious, I was only teasing." She said, smiling. "Is a full body wax what you had in mind for her, Michael?&nbsp; "Yes, what do you think of the hairstyle I chose for her?"&nbsp; I said, handing her the picture I downloaded and printed. 

" I prefer pixie cuts my girls."&nbsp; "It keeps them in their place."&nbsp; "Did you know Mandy had long honey blond waist length hair?" 

 "I had it cut short and layered, then bleached to a much lighter color; Mandy hates it, constantly begs to go back to her natural color."&nbsp; "But yes, that medium bob would suit your Princess well; the long bangs and hair framing her face, almost a long bowl cut, don't you think?"&nbsp; 

"Now that you mention it yes.... I do favor the bangs a great deal."&nbsp; 

"Eventually, she will grow it long again, that being my preference; she will keep the bangs and shorter hair framing her face."

"Sarah's hair will never be as beautiful as yours, Minerva."&nbsp; 

"That's very sweet of you to say." She smiled touching her hair, yet another tell.&nbsp; I knew Minerva was very vain about her hair; poor Mandy often received the crop, even when she styled Minerva's hair to perfection.&nbsp; Minerva was a terror just before a dance competition.&nbsp; 

"You could always dye hers the same color as mine," She suggested.&nbsp; 

"Your natural color could never be duplicated, my dear teacher," I said, getting up kissing her neck, stroking her ponytail.&nbsp; 
"To do so would be a sad counterfeit; as diamonds are to coal." &nbsp; 

"Bring her a bowl of oat meal as we planned and see to it that she takes her vitamins."&nbsp; "Spend about an hour with her."&nbsp; 

"Use your crop if you wish, but do not hit her in the face."&nbsp; "You know how much your beautiful red hair turns me on, I can't wait to eat you out."  I said, kissing the back of her neck.&nbsp; 

Minerva went downstairs and began training her in basic slave etiquette using the crop for any reason, real or imagined.&nbsp; 
Minerva put Sarah's hair up in pigtails and ordered her down on all fours, and lead her around the basement on a leash; making her bark. 

Sarah received her dinner: cold oatmeal with skim milk served in a dish on the floor, telling her "Since you are a, fat ugly hairy bitch and you should can eat like one."

Holding onto her pigtails and forcing Sarah's face into the bowl of oatmeal, making her eat like a dog.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

"You made me look bad in front of your Master." "You will not only be bald when I own you, I will have your breasts and clitoris surgically removed; bald bitch dogs have no need of them; maybe a total hysterectomy."&nbsp; "Then I'll have your teeth pulled making you a proper cunt licker."&nbsp; 

"Afterwards, no man will ever look at you again the way Michael does now." 

When she was done eating, Minerva made Sarah chew her vitamins.&nbsp; 

Before Minerva came back upstairs, she attached Sarah's leash to one of the sliding rings and left her blanket just out of her reach, but not the pail for her sanitary functions.&nbsp; 

When she arrived upstairs, I turned off the heat to the basement and shut down the lights.&nbsp; Although I went down her as promised, Minerva didn't return the favor, returning home to check on her girls.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

I went downstairs to check on my Princess and found her leaning against the pole shivering.&nbsp; I removed her leash, picked up her folded blanket, and sat on the couch.&nbsp; "Tell me what is on your mind, little lady," I inquired kindly.&nbsp; 

"Please, Master...I am so cold, may I have my blanket?"&nbsp; "Come and sit next to me.... Sarah, "You will soon be warm enough."&nbsp; "That's it get closer, put your head on my shoulder." "Now, let me put the blanket over you, we will share our body heat." 

 I put my arms around her and held her, talking softly until she stopped shivering.&nbsp; "You did well today, although you made a bad first impression with Mistress Minerva." "You are very pretty with your hair down." I said, taking her hair out of the pigtails "Just like the girls in the magazines you like to look at.... in secret." I said, kissing her forehead.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

"I know everything about you, my pretty girl."&nbsp; "You were never meant to be a little Amish mouse in a gray dress."&nbsp; "Do you really know what I did alone in the bathroom, Master; what I did is a sin."&nbsp; "Not in my world it's not, Sarah." "You live in my world now." "You will not be judged for that, nor punished for masturbating: sexual gratification is a natural as breathing."&nbsp; 

"How old are you, Sarah?"&nbsp; Twenty- three, Master."&nbsp; "And yet you are not married, why?"&nbsp; "I don't know...."&nbsp; "I don't know, Master." I corrected,  "I do not know, Master." She replied,&nbsp; "I do not know is not an answer; that is an evasion, a childish excuse."&nbsp; "I have no interest in children."&nbsp;&nbsp; 

"I am not a child, Master... I don't want to marry an Amish man."&nbsp; "Much better my pretty girl, that was an intelligent, honest answer."&nbsp; "I value honesty Sarah; I will never punish you for telling the truth."&nbsp; "You will be severely punished if you lie to me."&nbsp; "Are you warm now?"&nbsp; 

"Yes, Master." "Do you wish to be sold to Mistress Minerva."&nbsp;&nbsp; "No Master." "Please don't sell me to her; she will do terrible things to me...I"&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hush, I decided to keep you for now."&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you desire to please me, Sarah?"&nbsp; "Yes Master."&nbsp; "Turn around and face away from me." 

" Yes that's right, just like that.... good."&nbsp; "You have beautiful breasts, so sensitive; your nipples are already hard." 

"Does this feel good, my pretty girl, your Master.... a man stroking your breasts?"&nbsp; "Yes Master, much better then when I do it."&nbsp; 

"Are you aroused Sarah, are you wet between your legs?"&nbsp;&nbsp; "I already know the answer."&nbsp; "Play with yourself, make yourself come for your Master." "That will please me."&nbsp; "You are a pretty little thing."&nbsp; "Marvelous, relax, enjoy it; tell me when you are coming." 

"Remember little Sarah, if you lie to me you will be punished."&nbsp; "I can sense your orgasm rising, your sex betrays you." 

"You know you want to come, yes that's it moan louder if you wish my pretty Sarah." "This is why God made you a woman
and gave you a clitoris."

Sarah was definitely vocal in her orgasm, this time she did not cover her mouth with her hand, as she did while masturbating
in the ladies room.&nbsp; She came close to sliding off the couch with all her squirming. It was obvious that she was intent in pleasing herself as well as pleasing me; no wonder she didn't want to marry an Amish man, she would probably intimidate the hell out of the poor pious bastard.&nbsp; 

"There is a bowl with a few apples at the bottom of the stair; get them and bring them here." Biting into one of them, I said. "You must be hungry, the other two are for you."&nbsp; "Mistress Minerva is in charge of your diet."&nbsp;&nbsp; "We both agree you can stand to loose twenty pounds in keeping with your height and frame."&nbsp; "The apples will be our secret."&nbsp; "Sit on the couch and eat your apples."&nbsp; 

"When you are done eating, you may use the bathroom in the next room." I offered, getting up and punching in the numbers on the electronic keypad to unlock the door.&nbsp; "I am pleased with you this evening."&nbsp; "I will enjoy having you in my bed when the time comes."&nbsp; "For now, until your training is complete, you will sleep on the floor; with your blanket." 

 "Do you really think that I am pretty Master?"&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think you are very pretty, my horny little slave girl." 

The next day, Minerva arrived with Mandy to give Princess her full body wax.&nbsp; Mandy was a small and petite at five-three with blue eyes and a clear complexion. Her hair was blond and cut short in a neat pixie cut, as Minerva described to me the day before. 

I would estimate her age to be between 30 &amp; 35. Minerva had dressed her in a simple white smock with white pants and plain white nurses shoes.&nbsp; As slave etiquette dictates, Mandy assumed position immediately upon entering my threshold. "You may stand, Mandy, let me get a good look at you." 

 "Turn around slowly.............you have very nice manners, you assumed the position smoothly and gracefully." "Thank you Master Michael." She replied.&nbsp; "The basement is unlocked."&nbsp; "The kitchen is the second door to your right; the door to basement is open."&nbsp; "Go downstairs and introduce yourself to Princess."&nbsp; "Explain the procedure to her as this will be her first time."

"Your Mistress and I will be having coffee and will join when we are finished."&nbsp; 

"May she interact freely Minerva, it will put Princess at ease?"&nbsp; "You may, Mandy." Minerva replied. "Be discrete, as we discussed."&nbsp; "Go to the car and get your case and have everything prepared to start in one hour." "I want all of her hair removed from the neck down."&nbsp; "Yes Minerva" Mandy replied&nbsp;&nbsp; "I shall treat her as a paying customer."&nbsp; 

The waxing would take the better part of 3 hours. Minerva and I retired to the kitchen and had breakfast together. During breakfast, she received an important call on her cell phone, changing our plans.&nbsp; 

Minerva told me that she would be leaving Mandy with me until tomorrow morning.&nbsp; She would be meeting with her accountants. "While Mandy is here, why not have her cut Princess's hair."&nbsp; 

"Mandy tells me the Salon is booked straight the next two weeks with no openings."&nbsp; "Besides, I need to return the favor from yesterday, as I left in haste."&nbsp; "As a special treat you may have full use of Mandy until then." 

"That is very magnanimous of you Minerva, I accept, but as I said before; diamonds to coal, my gracious teacher." Minerva went downstairs to tell Mandy of the change in plans, then left for her appointments.

Mandy returned to report that she was done, and stood in the library waiting for further instructions.&nbsp; "You have permission to speak freely, come and stand before me."&nbsp; "How long have you been owned by Mistress Minerva" "Six years Master Michael."
Mandy replied.&nbsp; 

"Obviously you know your place and what is expected of you; being comfortable in your subservience; you may address me as Michael"&nbsp; "Remove all of your clothing.... slowly, that's it.....................................you have a very nice figure."&nbsp; 

"Thank you Michael"&nbsp; "Your Mistress advised you that you were to pleasure me."&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will comply with your wishes." She replied.&nbsp; 

"Go upstairs to the bathroom."&nbsp; "I left to door open for you."&nbsp; "You will find unopened toothbrushes, a fresh tube of toothpaste along with mouthwash on the counter; use them and wait for me there."&nbsp; 

I fixed my pretty girl her lunch: hot oatmeal with warm skim milk, plain yogurt, and a banana, orange and mint tea.
After she ate, I ran my hands up and down her body enjoying her smooth skin.&nbsp; "This is so much better, don't you think?" "Don't worry, you will get used to it, the first time is always the worst."&nbsp; 

"You will be getting a proper haircut by Mandy later today"&nbsp; "I am very partial to the style, very sexy. "Do your aerobic and stretching exercises on your pole as you have been instructed.&nbsp; I will unlock the bathroom for you before I leave.

Mandy was waiting for me, as instructed.&nbsp; I brushed my teeth, finishing by rinsing with generous amounts of mouthwash.&nbsp; Turning to her I reached out took her hands pulling her close. Taking hold of her ass cheeks, I kissing her mouth enjoying her sweet taste. Mandy returned my kisses, hesitating slightly at first, but soon was probing my mouth with her little tongue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

I started to undress, Mandy helped me off with my clothing, "Princess is waiting for her haircut."&nbsp; "She is doing her exercises now, the ones Minerva taught her.... thanks, just put everything in the hamper."&nbsp; "You did an exceptional job with the full body wax, I'm very pleased with the results."&nbsp; "I need your help with something else, I need you to make her jealous, can you do that for me Mandy?"&nbsp; &nbsp; 

Mandy put her arms around my neck, kissing me, her little tongue probing.... teasing.&nbsp; Her small hands caressing my chest, and then kissing, my chest and stomach.&nbsp; 

Mandy's hands now stroking my testicles, getting me hard. "Do you like that Master"?&nbsp; 

"Order me to lick and suck your cock." She said, seductively. 

"Not yet you little vixen, I want to taste you first."&nbsp; I said laughing, playfully slapping her bottom, "Get into the shower."

We took turns lathering one another with Pear's soap. Mandy shampooed my hair giving me a wonderful scalp massage, and then I did hers.&nbsp; After we toweled off, I ordered her to my bedroom and made her lie on her back with her legs spread.

I went down on her, licking and sucking, probing her clitoris with my tongue. 

Mandy's hands were in my hair, pushing my head against her dripping pussy, verbally urging me on. Just as her orgasm crested,&nbsp; "Stick you finger in my ass...push." Mandy's orgasm came in waves, her sweet juices covering my face as I licked like mad; and then, she went limp.

I lay down next to her, playing with her hard nipples watching her stretch her arms above her head, as she touched her hair and frowning momentarily; a possible tell.&nbsp; Smiling she rolled over and hugged me, kissing my face&nbsp; "Thank you for being so considerate and allowing me to be myself."&nbsp; "I didn't know what to expect." She said.  

"Tasting your juicy peach is all the thanks I need." I replied, playing with her short hair.&nbsp; 

"If I owned you Mandy, I would keep you all to myself and not share."&nbsp; "What about your Princes?"  "You would have to take turns."&nbsp; "I think I would prefer you with long hair." I added, continuing stroking her head.

"How long would you make me grow it, Michael?"&nbsp; "First we go back to your natural color."&nbsp; "I'm a honey blond."&nbsp; 

"I love that hair color, honey blond it is Mandy."&nbsp;&nbsp; "Next you would grow out the layers; no bangs for you."&nbsp; "Long honey blond, blunt cut all one length to your shoulders."&nbsp; "Just my shoulders?"&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like it longer Mandy?"&nbsp; I said feigning surprise.

"Before I signed my contract with the Sanctorum, Minerva promised never to cut my long hair."&nbsp; " It used to be waist length."
" Minerva makes me have my assistant bleach my roots every three weeks, and use thinning shears because Minerva does not like it too thick."&nbsp; "I hate it this way."&nbsp; 

"Please don't tell her I told you, she might make me cut it even shorter."

"Of course I won't, it will be our secret." I assured her, kissing her lightly on the lips.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

"I want you to visit often, you taste like peaches."&nbsp; "How about to the middle of your back, Peaches, maybe longer...depending..." "Depending upon what? She asked, sitting up looking at me.&nbsp; 

"Depending.... Oh how shall I put this?" I said teasing&nbsp; 

"Depending on how jealous you can make Sarah." "You could use a haircut Master, just a trim of course."&nbsp; "I will do it in front of her naked, then go down on you to see what you taste like."  

"Very good"&nbsp; "I have to check something first, then we will go to the basement together."

Mandy got dressed in her white outfit looking neat and professional, blow drying her damp hair and putting on makeup:
finishing with dark pink lipstick. I put on my L.L. Bean terry cloth robe and boxer shorts. 

When we got to the bottom of the stairs, she kissed my cheek, leaving the pink imprint of her lips there; then reapplied her lipstick.&nbsp; Taking her cue, I mussed up her hair, slapping her ass making her yelp and giggle.&nbsp; 

Sarah hair was shampooed and conditioned in the slop sink. I made her sit on a bar stool while Mandy cut Sarah's long hair.
Sarah received a long pageboy with curved eye framing bangs.&nbsp; Mandy then finished Sarah's makeover, by applying makeup.

The first makeup Sarah had ever worn.&nbsp;&nbsp; My little lady looked incredibly hot and seductive.

"Shake your head little lady."&nbsp; "Sarah shook her head from the side to side; when she stopped, the cut falling neatly back into place.&nbsp; I put my hand in her hair, kissing her mouth "You look lovely." I whispered in her ear "Good enough to eat." I said, kissing her, pushing a Hershey's Kiss into her mouth with my tongue. 

"This cut looks great on you." Mandy said to her&nbsp; "It is just long enough to pin up and will look very pretty curled."&nbsp; 

"Let me show you."&nbsp; Taking a curling wand, Mandy styled Sarah's hair in luscious ringlet curls.&nbsp; 

"I am ready to give you your trim now Master Michael."

I sat on the barstool and sent Princess over to sit on the couch.&nbsp; Mandy started by wetting my hair with water then combing it to check for cowlicks and find my part.&nbsp; "I'm feeling a little warm, I'm going to take off my to." She said, leaning over and kissing me.&nbsp; 

Mandy removed it leaving her lacey bra on to cover her small pert breasts.&nbsp; Mandy dropped the comb, as she bent over in front of me to pick it up; I leaned forward and squeezed her cute little ass.&nbsp; 

"Your pants also, I want to see what color your panties are."&nbsp;  "I'm getting warm myself, I have to keep the temperature like this for Princess." I stated removing my robe, sitting back down in my boxers.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

I kept interrupting my haircut, by grabbing her and kissing her mouth.&nbsp; I undid her bra and dropped it on the floor, Mandy just leaned in closer, rubbing against me with her breast, her nipples getting hard; leaning in kissing my mouth.&nbsp; 

I pulled her panties down around her knees; Mandy took them the rest of the way off.&nbsp; 

I could not see Princess, as my back was to her. Mandy told me afterwards that she couldn't sit still and was frowning.

After she was finished, I stood up pointing at the floor. Mandy got down on her knees before me.&nbsp; I took my boxers off&nbsp; "Very nice haircut, you little vixen."&nbsp;&nbsp; "Princess, come here.............. Kneel by Mandy."&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get closer to me so that I can play with your curls." 

 Mandy put on quite a show, licking and sucking. Fast.... slow, running her tongue up and down the shaft, teasing around the head; deep throating.&nbsp; I came in Mandy's mouth, and like the wonderful little vixen that she was, swallowed it all, not spilling a drop.&nbsp; 

"Go upstairs and wait for me in the library Mandy."&nbsp; "I have to get Princess settled in for the night." 

 Mandy gathered her clothing and haircutting equipment, a big smile on her face.&nbsp; I turned to Sarah, who was still on her knees, waiting.

"You have had quite the day."&nbsp; "A complete body wax, haircut and all."&nbsp; "Stand and face me."&nbsp; "Close your eyes and open your mouth."

 I removed a heresy's kiss from my robe pocket, unwrapped it and put it in her mouth.&nbsp; 

"You look lovely, my pretty lady."&nbsp; "Tomorrow you will given a sport bra, panties socks and sneakers to wear."&nbsp; 

"When you lose the weight, I may turn the hot water on." " Now go to your pole and I will attach your leash." 

"Mandy is a delightful little thing."&nbsp; "She will be sharing my bed this evening."&nbsp; 

"I believe that Minerva is trying to tempt me with her, perhaps trade even for you."&nbsp; "Good night."

Mandy was waiting in the library for me when I returned, curled up on the overstuffed leather couch. "I am in the mood for Chinese take-out."&nbsp; "There is a menu on the corkboard near the telephone in the kitchen."&nbsp; 

"I want chicken &amp; cashews, plus a pint of hot &amp; sour soup." "They make the chicken &amp; cashews right; no celery."&nbsp; 
"Order something for you, then call the order in for delivery."&nbsp; 

After we ate, we cuddled on the couch and listened to music. Mandy chose the Nutcracker Suite by Tchaikovsky, her favorite piece of music; then, we shared a bottle of chilled Inniskillin Riesling Ice Wine.&nbsp; 

I genuinely enjoyed just being with and holding her.&nbsp; As Minerva stated: " my methods are my own"; as are mine.&nbsp; Discipline and cruelty will merely produce an obedient drone.&nbsp; 

I want to experience all aspects of my slaves, not just their bodies.&nbsp; They have needs to satisfy the same as I.
Loyalty, affection, subservience, obedience; coupled with intelligence, all these are attributes of a desirable female slave. 

That evening in bed, Mandy kept me well satisfied.

Minerva arrived the next Saturday morning with bras, panties, and socks and several sizes of Nike sneakers for Sarah to try on.
She also brought Katherine, her other slave girl.&nbsp; Katherine was about Mandy's age, brown eyes at five-eight with a 
well- rounded voluptuous figure, well suited to bearing children.&nbsp; 

Her short hair was light brown with blond highlights added and styled in a short bob with short curved bangs. 

 Like Mandy, she was dressed all in white, except she was wearing her white lab coat instead of a smock.&nbsp;&nbsp; Katherine would be giving Sarah a physical and compile a medical history.&nbsp; In addition, she would be drawing blood for lab work.&nbsp; 
I planned on putting Sarah on birth control. 
 
While Katherine was giving Princess her physical, Mandy styled her Mistress's hair in a chignon.&nbsp; Minerva would be attending a gathering; a gathering was a meeting of the Sanctorum. 

Minerva was being summoned to sit on the tribunal of a Master for selling one of his slaves into prostitution to an outsider.

Minerva advised me that she would be out of state for the next five days.&nbsp; She would be taking Mandy with her to attend to her needs, especially, her hair and makeup.&nbsp; 

The doctor that Katherine worked for was on vacation for two weeks.&nbsp; 

Minerva made arrangements to have Katherine &amp; Mandy's small apartment painted, then new carpet put down.&nbsp; If nothing else, Minerva was a very well organized efficient woman, making full use of her time and money.&nbsp; 

"I know it's an imposition, would you please let Katherine stay with you while I am gone."&nbsp; "She has allergies too fresh paint, not to mention the new carpet." This will give the place time to air out thoroughly." 

"I think that you will enjoy having her." "Katherine has a very analytical mind."&nbsp; "You enjoy chess, I will very surprised if you can beat her."&nbsp; "As a matter of fact, I will bet you a dinner at Salvatore's that you lose 2 out of 3 games."&nbsp; 

"I will take that bet Minerva; enjoy your trip." I said, thinking, "I certainly will be enjoy this buxom beauty."

After her physical, Sarah was given her bras, socks and panties.&nbsp; After trying on several pair of Nikes; we determined that her correct size was 7 D; Katherine would return the others and get one extra pair in her correct size.&nbsp; 

Minerva went to check on Sarah's new hairstyle.

" Not bad, at least now she is a well groomed little doggie." she said, stroking Sarah's curls. "Did Mandy leave you makeup to practice with slut?"&nbsp; "Yes Mistress" "Thank you for my undergarments and sneakers." Sarah replied

"It is about time you remembered your manners little doggie." Minerva stated, stroking Sarah's face with the riding crop.
"I will be gone five days."&nbsp; "Katherine will be staying with your Master."&nbsp; 

"You will be provided with a jump rope and exercise mat." " Your diet will be modified to include more proteins."&nbsp; 

"When I return you had better have lost 25lbs., otherwise I will beat you."&nbsp; " Besides, after being with Katherine for five days, he will probably forget all about you." 

Minerva and Mandy left for the airport. I directed Katherine where to put her suitcase and makeup case.&nbsp; 
I gave her my car keys, credit card and a grocery list, and then sent her shopping.&nbsp; 

I also told her to purchase five outfits: Babydolls &amp; Teddies, explaining that is all she would be allowed to wear the next 5 days. 

 "If there is anything special you would like to eat, by all means purchase it"&nbsp;&nbsp; 

"Be warned, I am a competent chess player."&nbsp; "If you want desert, be prepared to win two out of three."&nbsp;  

Katherine drove away with a big smile on her face.

I found Princess wearing her new bra, panties and sneakers skipping rope.&nbsp; I sat down and watched her breasts bouncing up and down for a while, then called her over to sit down next to me.&nbsp; 

This time, she knew what to do, putting her head on my chest anticipating and craving my attention.&nbsp; 
"From this point on, when we are alone, you have permission to speak if you have a question or concern."&nbsp; 

"However, you will begin with by asking: "May I have permission to speak?"&nbsp; "Give me your hand, place it here, your fingers like this at the base of your throat."&nbsp; "This will be our non verbal signal."&nbsp; "I will either nod yes or shake my head no." 

"May I have permission to speak, Master?" "Yes." I replied,&nbsp; "I can never go back to my Amish community."&nbsp; 

"I don't want to go back now."&nbsp; " Mandy and Katherine seem so free, it is hard to explain."&nbsp; "They are so feminine." 
"They were very kind to me."&nbsp; "They seem so happy to be owned."&nbsp;&nbsp; 

"They are happy because they have totally submitted." I replied.&nbsp; "They are secure in their femininity in ways few women will ever experience."&nbsp; "How many husbands do you suppose put forth such time and effort to totally know their wives." 

"Will I be like them?" She asked,&nbsp; "You are like them."&nbsp; "Your nipples are hard as we speak, am I right?"&nbsp; 

"Yes." she replied, snuggling closer.&nbsp; 

"Are you horny my pretty girl, do you want come?"&nbsp; "Yes Master, do you want to fuck me?" She asked. 

"Such language, where did you ever hear that word?"&nbsp; "I just want to please you, Master."&nbsp; "Then don't be vulgar." I replied 
"I would prefer that you say make love."&nbsp; "And no, I do not want intercourse, I want oral sex from you." 

 "I left a basin with hot water and a wash cloth on the stairs, go get it." &nbsp; "Here it is Master, do you want me to wash you?"&nbsp; 
"Of course." I replied  "That is right, gently...take your time."&nbsp; "Good girl, I think that it is clean enough."&nbsp; 

"Put the basin back on the stairs."&nbsp; "Did you notice how Mandy did it?"&nbsp; "Yes that's right."&nbsp; "Lick the entire shaft................Marvelous."&nbsp; "Take your little tongue and lick the entire circumference of the tip."&nbsp; "Very good that feels wonderful."&nbsp; "Start sucking, good..........yes.... that's it...watch your teeth." I warned, lightly cuffing her head. 

"Get your hand out of your panties and stop playing with yourself." "Concentrate on what you are doing." I admonished, cuffing her again.&nbsp; 

Very satisfied, I just lay back on the couch with my hands buried in Sarah's hair until I exploded in her mouth. 

"That was very nice for your first attempt at fellatio." "You will have to learn to swallow it all unless you like having semen on your face."&nbsp; "Now clean the semen that you spilled on me with your tongue; then go wash your face and brush your teeth."

When Sarah returned, she sat back down on the couch with me, snuggling close, with her face on my chest. 

"Close your eyes and get ready to kiss me." I took a Hershey's Kiss from my pocket, unwrapped it, and put it in my mouth.&nbsp; When I kissed her, I pushed it into her mouth with my tongue.&nbsp; "For you my pretty girl."&nbsp; "Now you will taste like chocolate, when I kiss you."

"Take off your bra and panties now, but don't touch yourself." "I will do that for you."&nbsp; "Wonderful, you are absolutely dripping."&nbsp; "Your panties must be soaked."&nbsp; "Now kiss your Master."&nbsp; "Marvelous, you taste like chocolate."&nbsp; 
"You are a horny little thing."  

"Please Master, please let me come, your horny little slaves begs to let her come."&nbsp; 

"Stroke my cunt.... mmm, just like that...put your fingers in there................oh, that feels so good." 

" I'll be so good...I'm coming... I want to suck on it again...kiss me; kiss Master...............

Sarah orgasm was incredible; after she peaked, she just collapsed against me, softly crying. 

I stroked her hair and held her until she stopped.&nbsp; 

"I want you to keep me."&nbsp; "I want to stay here with you." "Please don't sell me."&nbsp; "I will do anything you say, my Master, my owner."&nbsp; "I can cook and clean house."&nbsp; "I will be anything you want me to be."&nbsp; 

"I want you to listen to Mistress Minerva and show her that she is wrong about you."&nbsp; 

"You will have to work extra hard to lose the weight."&nbsp; "I have some books on beauty and makeup for you to read in your spare time."&nbsp; "Katherine will help you with that."&nbsp; 

"Tomorrow, I will bring you a lighted makeup mirror and everything you will need to practice."&nbsp; 
"I promise I will not disappoint you Master, I have to exercise now, with your permission of course."&nbsp; 

Katherine returned from her shopping trip and put the groceries away.&nbsp; We went into the library and I put on some music that was suitable: a CD of Traditional Strip Club song that I bought on a whim for a dollar at a flea market.&nbsp; 

I sat back and watched her strip to the music and model the different baby dolls and teddies, settling on red, and the last one she tried on.&nbsp; 

We played chess until 4:00 PM; Minerva was right, I lost five out of seven and greatly enjoyed myself.&nbsp; I would like to think that that sexy little morsel distracted me.&nbsp; 

That was not the case; she was a much better player then I.&nbsp; I did notice a couple of tells.&nbsp; When she was attacking, she always made a loose fist before each move; while defending, she always touched her right cheek.&nbsp; 

Katherine was warned that she would play her best or I would tie her to the pole for the night. 

Watching her, I concluded that her mannerisms were precise, yet feminine; Katherine would be a delight to own. 
 I left Katherine in the library and went to the kitchen to prepare Sarah's meal.

Sarah was given a grilled chicken breast and steamed broccoli, carrots and white rice for dinner. I was very generous with her vegetable portions, a special treat for hard day of exercise.&nbsp; She was also given a large cup of jasmine tea with her meal.&nbsp; Sarah was excited about receiving her mirror and makeup tomorrow.&nbsp; "Master, are you going to have my ears pierced?"&nbsp; She asked.&nbsp; 

"Do you want to have your ears pierced?"&nbsp; "I've always wanted to have them pierced." Sarah replied.&nbsp; 

"Katherine says that she can do it and has stainless steel posts in her medical bag."&nbsp; "Is that so." I said, smiling.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"What else does Katherine say?"&nbsp; "She explained everything about my birth control pills and says I am very healthy." 

 "She thinks that you are handsome and loves your big house."&nbsp; "She hates living in that cramped apartment." "She said that she loved my haircut and wished that her hair was longer."&nbsp; 

"I had intended to have your ears pierced, Sarah."&nbsp; "In addition to that, I will have Katherine pierce your clitoral hood and have a permanent 18kt. gold ring inserted."&nbsp; "I will be eating my dinner soon."&nbsp; "I will talk to you again in the morning."&nbsp; 
"May I pleasure you again, Master?"&nbsp; 

"No, but I like the way that you asked, your choice of words."&nbsp; "Get some sleep, you have exercised enough for today."

 I walked away thinking, "She is coming along just fine."&nbsp; "Sarah will be willingly sharing my bed sooner then I thought."&nbsp; 
"I am assured admittance to the Sanctorum."

Katherine was waiting for me in the library, curled up with a copy of "Leaves of Grass" by Walt Whitman.&nbsp; 

"The shrimp is cooling in the refrigerator, along with a bowl of cocktail sauce."&nbsp; "I will put the steaks in the broiler for us as soon as the shrimp are well chilled." She added.&nbsp; 

"Very good," I commented " I am going to take a nap until dinner is ready, give me a least an hour."&nbsp; "Set the dining room table with the dishes from the dining room china cabinet." "The linen is the 3 bottom drawers along with the good silver."&nbsp; "Do not forget the good crystal."

We shared a couple bottles of Alamos Pinot Noir 2002 (Argentina) a nice red wine of moderate price. 
Katherine chose the dessert: New York Cheese Cake with fresh blueberries.&nbsp; 

I questioned her during dinner, asking about her profession, making small talk.&nbsp; I drank sparingly and mostly listened, the wine loosening her tongue.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

I found out that she loved poetry.&nbsp; The only time she read it was at work; Minerva did not approve, viewing poetry a waste of time.&nbsp; 

This issue was a shame.&nbsp; For one, Katherine having to read it behind her Mistress's back, and for Minerva not allowing her this harmless intellectual pleasure. I would keep this bit of information to myself, a minor infraction at best, certainly not one for her to be whipped.&nbsp; 

I did give her permission to be herself, because of this, I assumed a certain degree of confidentiality; slave girl or not.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
As I have said before, I have my own methods.&nbsp; 

As is my preference, and as a prelude to foreplay, I showered with Katherine as I did with Mandy.&nbsp; 

While her hair was still wet, I combed it straight back away from her face, tucking the sides behind her ears.&nbsp; As she stood admiring her reflection in the mirror, I stepped behind her; kissing and licking her neck and ears; caressing her curvaceous buttocks. 

"What a shame your hair isn't longer Katherine, I would love to see you with a ponytail."&nbsp; Katherine just sighed, not commenting.&nbsp; "Princess's hair will eventually be much longer."&nbsp; "Her present style is merely transitional."

"Minerva suggested that I cut it much shorter; like Mandy's."&nbsp; "I believe that bangs suit her; you are beautiful with or without." "I would prefer your hair longer."&nbsp; "In keeping with your professional image, you would keep it pinned up work."

 This brought a smile to her face, as I knew it would.&nbsp; 

Katherine turned, put her arms around my neck, kissing my mouth, "It would be wonderful if you would buy me from Minerva." 

"I will trust you not to tell her that; a girl can dream can't she?"&nbsp; Katherine was quite perceptive in concluding that I would remain silent. I could not afford her even if I were a member of the Sanctorum, which was the only way I could purchase her.&nbsp; 

If I could afford her, I doubt Minerva would sell her to me.&nbsp; Of the three, Sarah, Mandy and Katherine, Katherine was the most complex

Intellectually &amp; intuitively, she was Minerva's equal.&nbsp; It would be a pleasure to explore her complexities. For the present, as long as she trusted me and was forthcoming, her perspective about her Mistress was invaluable. 

"King takes queen.... or shall I say King will take the queen to bed."&nbsp; "We have five days to checkmate one another, Katherine." "You know where my bedroom is; wait for me there." 

I went to the library, locking the door behind me.&nbsp; Going to the wall-to-wall bookcase on the east wall, I pushed the hidden catch allowing one side to swing inward revealing a hidden room.&nbsp; Entering, I closed the door behind me. 

My entire house has concealed fiber optic cameras and microphones in every room.&nbsp; 

This is the Master control room for the entire property.&nbsp; The dummy room is hidden in the basement.&nbsp; Minerva knows everything about the dummy one; this one is a secret and will override everything.&nbsp; To Minerva's knowledge, there are only cameras in the basement and outside perimeter.&nbsp; 

I have a friend whose land is adjacent to mine. While I own 20 acres, David has at least 1400. I purchased most of my furniture from David, as he deals in the unusual and the unique.&nbsp; Most importantly, David is discreet, a most desirable quality in a friend.&nbsp; 

Whenever David goes out of town for any length of time, I keep an eye on his property and feed his dog Socrates.&nbsp; Aside from his new wife Laura, Socrates is a one-man dog.&nbsp; 

Socrates and I have a unique relationship.&nbsp; I let him out to do his business and feed him, Socrates mostly ignores me.&nbsp; 

Up until the time that he married, David was a very private person.&nbsp; I always called before I went to visit. 

David told me that I am always welcome.&nbsp; I even attended his wedding.&nbsp; Out of respect, I still will call first, emergencies aside.

My primary occupation is an Electrical Engineer and inventor holding multiple patents. I own a small business employing six people installing complete security systems of my own design.

I have a natural aptitude with computers and will build and incorporate them into the client's security systems.&nbsp; Like my friend David, my clients are very wealthy and value discretion.&nbsp; 

I installed David's security system. David and I remodeled the library containing the hidden room.

In addition to my security business, I am a silent partner in a business that manufactures stun guns and tasers, all government and police contracts.&nbsp; None of these are available to the public, all state of the art and my design.&nbsp; I gave one to David awhile back, although I have no idea what he will do with it.&nbsp; 

He and his wife are most proficient with firearms; and there is always Socrates.&nbsp; 

There are no paper blueprints for the one I used on Sarah.&nbsp; I custom built it for myself, the blueprints, in my head, as are those for my security system.&nbsp; 

After I ran a diagnostic on the system, I joined Katherine in the bedroom. 

We picked up where we left off in the bathroom.&nbsp; I made Katherine get on her hands and knees on the bed and entered her from behind.

My instincts about her were correct, Katherine enjoyed having intercourse in this position. 

She begged me to pull her hair while I was fucking her. Katherine liked it hard and fast and was capable of multiple orgasms.&nbsp; Actually, she liked intercourse in any position as long as it was a little on the rough side. After we finished making love we went right to sleep.&nbsp; Katherine was up early and prepared breakfast: sourdough pancakes,
pork sausages and hot coffee.&nbsp; "Do you want me to bring Sarah her breakfast?" She asked.&nbsp; 

"We will eat first."&nbsp; "Then you can bring it to her."&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am going outside for a couple of hours to cut some wood."&nbsp; "I have four cords done so far and hope to get three more cut and stacked for the season."&nbsp; "Do you want me to help you?" She offered.

"That won't be necessary, I need the exercise."&nbsp; "Pick up around the house.... on second thought, it could use a good dusting."
"I am sure that you can find your way around."

 I lost track of the time and was outside for most of the morning. When I returned, I found that Katherine had dusted and vacuumed my entire house. She greeted me at the door, assuming the position. Fresh from the shower her wet hair was combed straight back and shiny with hair gel. Katherine was wearing a red teddy, had put on her makeup; she was wearing blood red lipstick; I loved the look.


"You may stand slave girl, give your Master a kiss."  Katherine put her arms around my neck and complied.&nbsp; That was quite a work out; I'm soaked with perspiration." "I must smell terrible," I continued, "You smell wonderful." She replied. "Don't you want me to shower first?"&nbsp; "I love the smell of clean sweat." Katherine answered, continuing to kiss me.&nbsp; "Do you like my hair?"&nbsp; 

"Get down on your hands and knees and I will show you how much I like your hair." I did her doggie style, right there on the floor the way she liked it, fast and hard, slapping her ass and pulling her hair; afterwards I made her clean me with her mouth.&nbsp; 
"Assume the position.... very nice, I'm going to take a shower, then we will have lunch." "Do not move until I return."

After we ate we brought Sarah her makeup mirror and makeup, as well as her noon meal.&nbsp; After Sarah ate, she and Katherine took turns skipping rope and exercised together.&nbsp; 

I turned on the hot water to the slop sink and the bathroom allowing Sarah free access for a hot shower and a toilet.&nbsp; 
The girls had worked up quite a sweat together trying to out do one another at jump rope.

I suggested that they shower together while I watched.&nbsp; They soaped each other down, washing &amp; conditioning each other's hair and drying themselves off.&nbsp; Then they spent half-an-hour doing each other's makeup. I observed that Katherine enjoyed brushing Sarah's hair. 

When they finished, I sat on in the middle of the couch, calling them over. With one slave girl on either side, I announced, "We are going to have a kissing contest."&nbsp; "There is cheese cake with blueberries in the fridge."&nbsp; 

"The best kisser gets a piece" Having two naked women on a couch trying to out do one another is an experience every man should enjoy at least once in a lifetime.............................&nbsp; : I declared the contest a tie.

Katherine and Sarah spent a great deal of time together during those 5 days.&nbsp; In a sense, Katherine was Sarah's mentor, as her gentle influence encouraged and taught Sarah the etiquette of the slaves as mandated by the Sanctorum.&nbsp; No doubt, it also helped her be more at ease with her previous repressed sexuality, by having another woman's perspective.&nbsp; Having an exercise partner was another bonus. 

On our last evening together, Katherine and I were sitting together in the library sharing a bottle of Dunnewood Merlot.
Katherine again told me something about Minerva that was quite insightful.&nbsp; I had always assumed that Minerva was bi-sexual
or a lesbian.&nbsp; 

I saw no purpose in having female slaves unless you intended in having sexual relations with them.&nbsp; Minerva enjoyed the power and prestige of being a Mistress, a dominant.&nbsp; Katherine and Mandy were for the most part a source of income.
Not that she mistreated them; they were more like unpaid servants for life. Minerva preferred the company of men.

This was a puzzle. If she preferred males, why have female slaves?&nbsp; This was not a question that I could just come out and ask her.&nbsp; I needed her support to enter the Sanctorum.&nbsp; In any case, it was none of my business. 

When Minerva returned, she was very pleased with Sarah's progress.&nbsp; She put on quite the show when I refused to sell Sarah to her, pretending to be angry. I gladly took her out to dinner at Salvatore's twice, once for losing our bet, the other because we both craved their veal marsala.&nbsp; 

Three months had come and gone, Sarah had safely lost the required weight and was very tone and trim. She was now allowed upstairs during the day, and was given her house cleaning duties.&nbsp; In this she excelled; in addition too cooking and baking the recipes that her mother and aunts taught her. 

I purchased a variety of leotards for her to wear around the house.&nbsp; They hugged her contours and showed off her beautiful figure; a constant reminder for her to maintain her optimum weight with diet and exercise.

Sarah was required to read one book a week and we discussed it, reviewing what she had learned.&nbsp; 
I purchased some used textbooks and brought home library books on music and music appreciation; Sarah received constant exposure to all aspects of my collection, and learned to enjoy the classics.

On the first day of the fourth month, I have placed a calendar on the refrigerator.&nbsp; On the last day of the month, Sarah will be allowed to sleep in my bed and we will have intercourse. For now she will be sleeping on the floor at the foot of my bed.
Each day she will place an X on the calendar to record the passing days.&nbsp; She was not allowed orgasm until then and must pleasure me with her mouth. 

The day finally arrived and I failed to qualify beforehand exactly when it would begin.&nbsp; At exactly 12:01 AM, while I was still asleep, Sarah got up off of the floor and got into bed next to me, waking me up. "What do you think you are doing?" I asked.
"You said I would share your bed and I have been good." She replied, snuggling closer. "Do you realize what time it is?"
"It is the last day of the month." She meekly relied, adding "Are you angry with me?" "No, technically you are right; it is the next day and I did promise." I replied, putting my arm around her.&nbsp; 

"Are you going to make love to me now?" she asked, kissing my neck. "Later."&nbsp; "Oh." she sighed, disappointed. "But you have been good, my pretty girl." "You do know your place." "That deserves a reward."

"You may address me by my first name when we are alone, such as now."&nbsp; "Will that satisfy you until morning, Sarah?"
"Yes Michael, I can wait until morning." she replied, kissing my mouth and snuggling closer&nbsp; "Good night, Master."

The alarm was supposed to go off at 7:00 AM, but did not; I woke up instead to my little princess's sweet kisses on my face.&nbsp; 
"Did you sleep well, Michael?" "Do you want me to prepare your breakfast?"&nbsp; "Yes, very well indeed, and no; you and I will be going out for breakfast."&nbsp; "Are you well rested little princess?"&nbsp; "Yes Michael, thank you for asking." "I've never eaten in a restaurant before." "I am sure that you will enjoy the experience, but first things first."&nbsp; "Stand at the end of the bed"...."Heel"...."Down."

"Tell me what you want," I ordered "I want to feel you inside of me Michael."&nbsp; "I want you to suck on my breasts."
"What else do you want, Princess?" I asked, getting out of bed and stroking her moist cunt with my fingers.

"I want to lick your cock and suck on it."  "Who am I?" "You are Michael, my Master."&nbsp; "You are dripping with desire my pretty girl, your sweet flower is my property as is the rest of you."&nbsp; I took her on the floor in the bedroom. Sarah's sweet orgasm was incredible...I'm coming.... ooh God it feels so good...Master.... I want to suck on it.... yes, oh yes.......................make love to my cunt.....................................................................After she came; I rolled her over on her back, pounding her until I achieved mine.

After we showered, I said "There is a large package wrapped in brown paper in the hall closet for you; bring it here."
Sarah ran to the closet bringing it back to the bedroom, and then carefully opened it, folding the paper and putting it to one side.
"I decided that leotards might not be practical for outside attire."&nbsp; "I will bet my eye teeth that the blue jeans are a perfect
fit." "Katherine washed three times adding fabric softener at the end of the wash cycle." "Minerva chose the blouse: Chinese silk, a beautiful shade of jade green." I added. 

"Did Mistress Minerva really select this blouse for me, it is very beautiful? " She exclaimed, rubbing the fabric on her face.
"I thought that she hated me!"&nbsp; "Minerva is a practical women."&nbsp; "She has resigned herself to the fact that you are mine and not for sale or trade."&nbsp; "Minerva has a wonderful sense of style."&nbsp; "In attempt to appease her and smooth things over, we will be meeting her for breakfast."  "Then we will be taking you shopping for clothing; I defer to her sense of style in women's attire."

Sarah thanked Minerva for the blouse and Minerva...well, Minerva was Minerva. We went to the different women's clothing stores; Minerva chose the clothing and Princess dutifully tried them on.&nbsp; Minerva did not ask Sarah's opinion about anything.&nbsp; What she did chose for her looked good on Sarah and was most appropriate; I concurred with all her selections. The shopping excursion took less then 2 hours, as Minerva no doubt scoped out her selections ahead of time.

After Minerva left, I took Sarah to a jewelry store and bought her a pair of 18-karat gold hoop earrings; she put the stainless steel posts she was wearing in her pocket, putting the hoops on before she left the jewelry store.&nbsp; Sarah left the store beaming, she looked beautiful and she knew it.&nbsp; My final purchase for her was perfume.&nbsp; I have always been partial to the scent vanilla.
We went to Macy's going directly to the perfume counter.&nbsp; The woman behind the counter would not stop flirting with me; much
to Sarah's displeasure.&nbsp; All that Sarah could do to show her displeasure, was to stand close to me hanging to my arm; however, if looks could kill.............................

I bought her a bottle of spray cologne: Vanilla Fields by Coty and received many hugs and kisses while we were in Macy's, some no doubt for the benefit of the flirtatious sales clerk. We spent the rest of the day in bookstores, browsing.

Seven months after Princess's abduction, I was summoned to a gathering of the Sanctorum. Sarah would also be attending for her interview in preparation to sign her slave contract.&nbsp; Minerva would act as my advocate.

The gathering was held in a building that previously was a Grand Old Hotel on the Hudson River, which was remodeled and restored to its former glory by the Sanctorum. Security on the grounds was extremely tight; we went through 3 checkpoints 
before we reached the Grand Hotel Main Building.

The three of us were escorted to the waiting room off of the main lobby.&nbsp; Minerva directed Sarah to strip as she would be naked and on display for most of the weekend; slaves were not allowed clothing once the gathering started, unless they were assigned to serve refreshments. 

My initiation and oath would be before the council of 50, which consists of a Grand Master/Grand Mistress representing
each of the 50 United States.&nbsp; Afterwards, I would be given a gold signet ring upon which the Sanatorium's seal is engraved.

I was also required to bequeath 51% of all of my financial assets and real property to the Sanctorum, at the time of my death.

It should be noted: the Sanctorum considered Slaves real property. Following this paperwork, I was given a retinal scan and my right hand was scanned to record my fingerprints for security and identification purposes. 

Lastly, I gave them a cashier's check in the amount equal to 20% of my net worth, predetermined by their forensic accountants.

I was forth coming in declaring everything, including the money hidden in my mattress. The benefits of membership far out weighed the initial cost.&nbsp; Their code of ethics was quite simple, loyalty, honesty and secrecy to the Sanctorum and Masters/Mistresses of the brother and sisterhood. 

After my initiation and paperwork, I was shown to my room by a naked blond slave girl to rest for the gathering- proper,
followed by an informal get-to- together of owners and slaves.&nbsp; Minerva's room was adjacent to mine; she left me a note to meet her in the lobby at 7:30PM;I took a shower and a nap, setting my alarm for 6:30PM.

During the informal get- to -together, Sarah was required to serve refreshments for one hour to the dominants in the ballroom, as were the other slaves present.&nbsp; She was dressed in a French Maid's Outfit as were all the other slaves assigned to that duty; there were no males slaves present.

Minerva was introducing me around when the pieces to the puzzle about Minerva's sexual preferences were coming together.&nbsp; 
Of the Fifty Grand Masters &amp; Mistress's present at my initiation, only ten were women; the men out numbered the women four to one.&nbsp; Dominants, male or female must only be an allowed to own female slaves.&nbsp; "Michael did you hear what I just said?"
"No, I'm sorry Minerva, I was just thinking how lucky I was to find your dance studio."&nbsp; "Without your help, I would never be here today, my marvelous mentor."&nbsp; "You were saying."&nbsp; "You are welcome Michael." "Now that you are one of us, I wish to thank you as well."&nbsp; 

"Your Sarah has created quite a stir among the gathering."&nbsp; "The concept of stalking and abducting an Amish women; not to
 mention successfully turning her into your slave and having her sign a contract." "&nbsp; I as your mentor share a small portion of the accolades." "As well as my own for bringing you into the fold, so to speak."&nbsp; 

"I was saying, that there is someone I want you to meet."&nbsp; "She wants to purchase Sarah from you."&nbsp; "Before you say no, hear me out."&nbsp; "Your account in Luxemburg."&nbsp; "She is willing to transfer one two hundred fifty thousand dollars to your account."&nbsp; 

I felt a small hand touch the small of my back; my beautiful Princess had turned in her maid's uniform and was kneeling naked beside me. Sarah placed her hand at the base of her throat as I taught her. I smiled at her and shook my head, indicating that she did not have permission to speak.

"No Minerva, I respectfully must decline her offer." "I know you so well my student." "I knew that you would say that" 
"Grand Mistress Maud is the prospective buyer." "The answer is still no!"&nbsp;  "Will you at least meet with her Michael?"

"Of course I will meet with her." "She is after all a Grand Mistress." "Then I will schedule a private audience with her Michael."

 "While I an gone, consider her offer."&nbsp;&nbsp; "Keep in mind two hundred fifty thousand dollars to her is like one hundred dollar to you and I."

Minerva left to talk with the Grand Mistress and I gave Sarah permission to speak "I signed my contract with them, Master"
"I have never seen so many beautiful naked women before, all of them slaves; I am so happy." 

"I expected to be groped and leered at, but that was not the case." "Everyone here seems so organized and relaxed."

"The people here are unique my pretty girl"&nbsp; "You are not some whore or slut on display." "A slave practices her art, as does a
Dominant."&nbsp; "Much like the geishas of Japan."&nbsp; "You are a valued piece of property to be guarded and protected."&nbsp; "Leering and groping is considered bad form and could lead to censure or expulsion."&nbsp; "There are other factors I will not discuss here."&nbsp; "Did you eat?"&nbsp; "Yes, we were fed before we served refreshments."&nbsp; "It was explained to me that my primary duty now is to attend to you."&nbsp; "I will be going back to your room with you later for the rest of our stay."

As we were talking, I could her a familiar voice calling to me from across the room. I looked up to see my divorce attorney
Matt Alderman wave to call me over.&nbsp; Kneeling naked beside him was his receptionist, Nancy, looking lovelier then ever.

"Congratulations Michael, welcome to the Sanctorum."&nbsp; "Is this the one I have been hearing so much about?" She is quite pretty."
"Thank you Matt" "I have finally found my place in the world"&nbsp; "And you Nancy, you are looking lovelier then ever."

"Thank you Master Michael, but if you will excuse me, I am required to serve refreshments soon." 

Matt and I found an empty table and sat down; Sarah kneeled down next to me.&nbsp; "Do you still hate your ex wife- Michael?"
"I don't really hate her per say."&nbsp; "I was betrayed by her."&nbsp; "She did commit adultery." 

"On the other hand if it were not for her..."I know what you mean." Matt interrupted. "If it were me, I would have ruined her by now."&nbsp; "Both financially and mentally." "First, she would crawl back begging, then be under my thumb...finally, I would sell the cunt." Matt raised his hand motioning to a pretty blond slave carrying a tray with glasses of champagne. "Thank you, I will take two."&nbsp; He said handing me one. "You look very nice with clothing, Cindy." "Send my regards to your Master." "You are dismissed."

 "A toast to you Michael, may you acquire many more!"

Matt was obviously well into his cups. This would be my opportunity to get some answers. I found out that Grand Masters are not elected, but appointed by a consensus of the fifty.

Grand Mistresses serve at the pleasure of the Sanctorum; they may make recommendations, but their number is limited to
ten; Grand Masters have the weighted vote.&nbsp; The value of Mistresses lies in their ability to secure women slaves for the Masters.
Wealthy, intelligent women such as Grand Mistress Mandy are considered an asset to the Sanctorum as a whole.

It was announced at the gathering proper that Grand Mistress Athena would be stepping down due to health reasons.
A replacement would have to be chosen by the fifty.&nbsp; Minerva was rumored as a possible replacement; being highly regarded
by many of the fifty; especially by her mentor; Grand Mistress Maud. 

The last piece of information was the most valuable of all; Male slaves did not exist in the world of the Sanctorum.
Masters or Grand Masters found guilty of serious offences could be put to death; males played for the highest stakes of all"

My meeting with Grand Mistress Maud was not what Minerva expected; I turned down the second offer as well; politely of course.&nbsp; The Grand Mistress was gracious, telling me that the offer was on the table if I were to change my mind.

Minerva's anger was barely contained. The only indication of such was in her green eyes; I expected lightning bolts to strike me down from the looks that she gave me.&nbsp; "What's done is done Michael."&nbsp; "It is certainly your right to refuse her offer."
"If you do reconsider, I would be willing to give you unlimited access to my girls."&nbsp; "I would keep their incomes of course."

"This is your day after all, go back to the ballroom and mingle, I will be with you shortly," she added, kissing my mouth and biting my lip enough to hurt and smiling.&nbsp; I was tempted to swap her ass as she walked away, but thought the better of it.

One year had now gone by. Minerva had not achieved her goal to be a Grand Mistress; a Grand Master was installed in that vacancy.&nbsp; Minerva and I had grown apart, no longer spending as much time together.

During the previous five months, I took off some time from work, and did some traveling. Sarah and I went to Hawaii for two weeks. I rented a convertible; we spent another month just touring the country, staying in the best hotels, many nights for free;
compliments of the Sanctorum.&nbsp; 

Minerva showed up one evening with dressed to kill.&nbsp; She was wearing a tight black dress and her makeup was impeccable.
Minerva's beautiful red hair was curled and pinned up; the way she knew I liked it.&nbsp; "We are both too stubborn for our own good"

"I want things to be the way that they were." she said, kissing my mouth. "Let me make things up to you." "I promise that I will
make this an evening that you will never forget."&nbsp;  I was thinking "My beautiful Minerva, I'm sure it will be an evening neither
of us will forget."&nbsp; "Shall we dance first, my marvelous mentor, just the two of us?" "I shall lock Sarah in the library for the evening so as not to disturb us." I replied.

We danced, shared a bottle of Giesen Riesling 2006 (New Zealand), and then danced some more. Minerva was quite passive this evening and I did some things I had never done to her in the past while dancing; I patted and squeezed her ass and played with her hair; first taking the hairpins out letting it down and playing with her loose curls as we danced; and she let me, seemingly enjoying the attention.

Minerva suggested we go to my bedroom; she wanted to spend the night. Once there she said "There is the matter of oral sex
owed to you lover."  She said removing her slinky black dress.&nbsp; "Lie on your back and close your eyes; relax I will take care of everything." I did as she requested, anticipating what would come next. "Are the condoms still in your top dresser drawer?"

"As always."  I answered, on the bed with my eyes closed.&nbsp; "I will get them out for when you will pleasure me."

Minerva started by stroking my penis with her hand, then licking the tip.&nbsp; I felt something cold on my neck; I opened my eyes. Minerva had removed my taser from the drawer and pressed against my neck. "Surprise lover!" She said, smiling, depressing the
switch, the arc of electricity jumping between the electrodes. "You ungrateful bastard." "You cost me a great deal of money, not to mention my chance to be Grand Mistress."&nbsp; I just lay there not moving. "That should keep you in your place for awhile."

"You are a fool Michael, telling me about your hidden control center in the basement."&nbsp; "For a security expert, you are not very secure."&nbsp; "While you and Princess were on vacation, Maud and I made some modifications."&nbsp; 

"What do you think of that?"  She exclaimed, placing the taser on my testicles and again pressing the switch.
"Maud is five minutes from here, I am going to pick up my cell phone and call her"................ "She is on the way, Michael." 
"The offer is still on the table except now the offering price is a dollar." "You are going to take it." "Did I mention we planted
bogus evidence showing money in off shore accounts in the Cayman Islands proving you lied to the Sanatorium's auditors."

"If you want to remain a Master in good standing, you had better do as you are told, little boy." Leaning forward kissing my mouth, she again zapped me with the taser.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Minerva then put the taser on the bed next to me. Turning her back to me, she bent over to pick up her dress.
I sat up and slapped her shapely ass, hard, causing her to shriek with surprise and fright.

I picked up the taser, a smile on my face "Minerva, Minerva...my beautiful teacher and mentor." "What have you done?"

"How....I don't understand........."You mean this." I interrupted, offering her the taser. " But, I tested it myself, just like you showed me Michael; the electricity jumped between the electrodes................................

"Very simple my dear; let me explain."&nbsp; "There is a hidden switch inside this unit that can only be activated by a samarium cobalt magnet of a specific polarity." "This mentioned magnet is contained within this titanium ring that I always wear."
I stated, holding up my hand.&nbsp; "Without the ring, the sparks are just for show."

"We still broke into your security system..." I laughed and just shook my head. "Every room in this house has multiple fiber
optic cameras and microphones."&nbsp; "Everything you have done has been recorded."&nbsp; "The room you know about is not the Master Control; that is elsewhere."&nbsp; "As we speak, there is a live feed over the internet on an encrypted connection to a few concerned Grand Masters."&nbsp; "You have incriminated yourself, as well as Grand Mistress Maud."

"What happens now Michael?"  "Get dressed and pin up your hair, Maud will be here shortly" "Why pin up my hair?" "Just do it Minerva, that is not a request."&nbsp; Minerva meekly did as she was told.&nbsp; "I am going to allow you your dignity for now; we are still equals."

"Go downstairs and let her in, I need to get dressed."&nbsp; "I will meet you two in the kitchen; you know how I like my coffee."
After Minerva went downstairs, I turned on my laptop to monitor things from upstairs.&nbsp; As soon as the Grand Mistress was in the house, I disabled all the electronic locks, keeping them from leaving.&nbsp; I also jammed any cell phones from working inside the house.

I found them both waiting for me in the kitchen.&nbsp; Maud was calm and collected sipping her coffee; Minerva was sitting next to her with her hands over her face crying.&nbsp; I poured myself a cup of coffee and sat down facing them.&nbsp; 

Maud was the first to speak "For goodness sake Minerva, stop crying and try to act like a Mistress for the short time you have left as one."&nbsp; "All the doors leading to the outside are locked and you somehow jammed my telephone reception: by the way thank you for the coffee." "You are welcome Grand Mistress."

"Good form Master Michael, I detected no sarcasm in your voice."&nbsp; "None was intended." I replied.

" How long until the enforcers arrive?" She asked.&nbsp; "They will be here in approximately ten minutes." "I have disabled the cameras and microphones to this room." "You may speak freely." 


"We should have been more careful"&nbsp; "Minerva underestimated you and I overestimated her" "Minerva is in love with you 
Michael; and was too proud to tell you; she is jealous of your slave, Princess."&nbsp; "My love for Minerva and her jealousy towards your Sarah has been our ruin." "You however will come out of this a wealthy man"

"I care for her deeply, despite everything that has happened" "Do you understand what I am telling you, Michael?"
"I understand perfectly, Maud." 

The enforcers arrived and escorted Maud and Minerva from the premises. Grand Master Arthur remained
to brief me on the upcoming events.&nbsp; "The Tribunal of 13 will take place in 3 days"&nbsp; "Mistress Minerva and Grand Mistress
Maud will be defending themselves." 

"I have known Maud for over forty years" "Her financial savvy has greatly increased the Sanctorum's coffers during that time" "You will of course will testify against them for their crime against you" "If they are found guilty, and they will be found
guilty, they will be stripped of their titles and made slaves." 

"It is your right to claim 20% of their net worth; the rest will go to the Sanctorum" "In Maud's case, you are looking at close to 
six million dollars" "I would ask you a favor"&nbsp; "Lay no claim on Maud's person"&nbsp; "Allow her to be a community slave of the Sanctorum" "Maud still can still be of some service to us because of her financial savvy; The 50 will remember your generosity."

Minerva and Maud were found guilty as Grand Master Arthur predicted.&nbsp; Minerva became my property, per the prior stipulations
of her Mistress's contract.&nbsp; Katherine and Mandy's contracts were transferred to me; I would now receive their incomes. 

I am a wealthy enough Master to now afford four lovely slaves, and because of this, my standing in the Sanctorum grew immensely.&nbsp; I received multiple offers to purchase Minerva: I turned them all down; I had plans for her.

I will close down her dance studio; the beauty salon shall remain opened.&nbsp; Katherine may continue on with her profession and both she and Mandy will now live with me.&nbsp; After all, I have eight bedrooms, plenty of room for all of us.

 Minerva finally got her pole; she is bound to it in the basement. In 5 minutes she will have been standing for 24 hours.

I expect to problems from her; Minerva is a broken, disgraced women. Unfortunately, I will have to make an example of her.

Like Maud, despite everything that has happened, I do care for her. Minerva will make a marvelous slave.......................

"It is time, Michael."  Katherine informed me, we are ready.&nbsp; We went down to the basement to prepare Minerva for her new life.&nbsp; 

Taking her face in my hands "I am going to take out your ball gag" "You do not have permission to speak" "You will listen,
slave Minnie; once known as Mistress Minerva." "You will have to earn the privilege to serve me."&nbsp; "You will be the sevant
of my three girls standing before you."

"Slaves though they may be, their loyalty to me is absolute" "You will be their servant, a slave to slaves."

"And now for your collar Minnie" "Although only a prototype, it will do the job." I said locking it into place.

"You are confined to this house." "You will not be allowed outside."&nbsp; "This collar will prevent it."&nbsp; "The electrical shock will
will render you unconscious if you attempt to disobey." "I will have your permanent collar completed it a few weeks"
"It will be smaller and prettier, but just as effective; it will also be waterproof."

"My girls have decided that you need a haircut" "It is unseeingly that a slave's servant have longer hair then theirs."

"But first, there is the issue of oral sex owed."&nbsp; I released her from the pole and made her kneel before me. Mandy brought me her scissors.&nbsp; I cut her beautiful long hair level with the nape of her neck as she went down on me, as the girls watched.

Katherine ordered her to sweep up her hair, and throw it in the trash.&nbsp; Minnie's haircut was not over: Mandy would do the honors and finish it. But first Princess ordered her to the slop sink and ordered her to wash her body and shampoo her hair; cold water only.

The first cut was a chin length blunt bob, that when blow-dried and brushed out was quite attractive on her. 

"Is her hair short enough Michael?" "I want it as short as yours Mandy."&nbsp; "When your hair is shoulder length again, you may
allow her to grow it out again." "By then, she may be worthy to serve me."&nbsp; "We will see."

Mandy gave Minnie her final haircut, a short pixie cut with bangs.&nbsp; We left Minerva crying on the floor, tied to her pole

Author's Note: The story resumes 14 months after Minnie; formally Mistress Minerva becomes the servant of her Master's slaves. When appropriate, I will go back in time to specific events and offer clarifications or explanations.&nbsp; When I make reference to Princess, I am talking about Sarah.
All of Minnie's real property and assets have been transferred to her new Master and former peer in the Sanctorum.&nbsp; Any and all personal property, including clothing, jewelry...everything, is gone. For the first time in her adult life she is totally dependent upon on the man she once
befriended, fell in love with, and then tried to betray.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;


Things had settled down quite nicely in my household these past 14 months.&nbsp; Minnie has been confined to the house, and allowing for her time -of- the month, is required to remain naked most of the time. With the weather permitting, Minnie may go outside with me when I split and cut firewood. Mandy's hair is again her own virgin natural honey blond, grown out from a bleached blond layered pixie to a blunt bob without bangs; her hair now much thicker and softer just touching the bottom of her ears; She can't wait until it is waist length again, as it was when Minerva acquired her.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Katherine's hair is growing out nicely: light brown in color, cut in a blunt bob, just brushing the nape of her neck.... no bangs of course. Sarah's hair is the longest of my four girls, dark brown and blunt cut four inches below her shoulders; I have decided that Sarah will keep her eye framing bangs.&nbsp; I prefer long hair on my girls. They will grow it waist length for me.&nbsp; It will be their crowning glory, my love reins, most suitable to tie to the pole, if the need arises. 

When their hair is long enough, I have decided that they will wear it up when they leave the house in keeping with Sarah's Amish background. Mandy is the most proficient with any bun style, French twist or upswept hairstyle. Sarah learned simple buns and braids growing up. 

Naturally they will wear makeup to enhance their natural beauty and colorful stylish clothing, not the severe Amish dresses and head coverings of Sarah's past life; before she became my slave.&nbsp; I have on occasion required them to dress exactly alike, especially when we all go out for dinner.

I find women who wear their long hair pinned up to be very attractive.&nbsp; This type of hairstyle is both elegant and practical; it is also an issue of control; a slave must know her place. Minnie understood this when she was Mistress Minerva; she understands it now and is powerless to change anything. 

She wore her beautiful thick and silky red hair long and deliberately kept her slaves hair cut short...control and dominance. Minnie did not want them more beautiful then she. Minerva wanted all the attention for herself.&nbsp; Minerva understood my preference, fetish if you will, for women with long hair.&nbsp; She teased me with hers.&nbsp; 

Minnie fixed her hair in a pretty bun on the day of her betrayal; she thought to entice and arouse me under the pretence of making up.
As one consequence of her failed coup, I initially had Minnie's hair trimmed and thinned by Mandy every three weeks to maintain the pixie haircut that she imposed on Mandy.&nbsp; 

I started allowing Minnie's hair to grow out seven months into her sentence. Minnie now has a modified bowl cut; five inches long on top, the longer bowl section curving just above her ears; full and thick on the back and sides. Mandy choose this style, as it will grow out easily to a blunt bob when the time comes.&nbsp; Minnie hates her hair short.&nbsp; Even though I prefer it longer, I have decided that she will keep this style for now.&nbsp; It will require her to try even harder for my attention and approval considering that there are three younger slave girls in my household that have hair longer then hers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

It may seem odd to some that I refer to them as girls.&nbsp; Mandy just turned thirty-two, Katherine is thirty-four, while Sarah is the youngest, at twenty-five, the baby of my slave women.&nbsp; Which brings us to Minnie, the oldest, she will be thirty-seven tomorrow.

Minnie can easily pass for a woman in her late- twenties and is the most beautiful of my four slave girls. She is the closest to me in age, I being forty-two. Minnie is one of those rare, lucky women who will be a classical beauty well into her seventies. Nevertheless that is how I affectionately think of them and often address them as my girls.

 I take no pleasure on the restrictions that I imposed on her because of her betrayal. They were necessary for the good of the household. Minnie is a slave, nothing more nothing less, and her status in the Sanctorum now greatly diminished: a slave and a servant to slaves.&nbsp; Order and discipline must be maintained, countered with fairness and kindness.

As one of her restrictions, Minnie is required to sleep alone in the basement under the most Spartan of conditions. The first month, secured to her pole in a sitting position.&nbsp; For the remaining time she was given a thin neoprene mat for the floor and a quilt that Sarah made for her from coarse cotton material; she will sleep on the floor leashed to the pole; a plastic bucket for her sanitary needs. 

On her birthday, this final restriction will be lifted; Minnie will to be allowed to sleep in a proper bed and given clothing. In the event that she backslides, I reserve the right to modify the conditions at any time.&nbsp; 

I am not one for orgies in the Master Bedroom, my bedroom. I prefer to sleep with one girl at a time. I must clarify what I mean by "sleep with".

At night, when it is bedtime, when it is time to sleep, as we all must, I will select one of my girls to share my bed for the night, which includes her pleasuring me. For minor offences and as a punishment, the offending girl may be leashed to the bedpost and made to sleep naked on the floor at the foot of the bed. 

Not that I have not had two or three of my girls at once; I prefer to do this during the day.&nbsp; The girls look forward to their "special time" at night. Each of my girls has their assigned bedroom for those nights they are not with me.&nbsp; 

Two months into Minnie's sentence, Princess spent a night sleeping on the floor for thinking that she could punish and/or abuse Minnie when nobody was watching. What she did is not important; it shall remain in the family; between my girls and I.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

What is important is that she now realizes what she done was petty and greatly disappointed me. I expected better from her and told her so in private. 

 Every Saturday morning, I gather my girls together for a household meeting. Any concerns and suggestions are discussed; of course, I remain the final arbiter. . Everyone is assigned household chores for the week. 

Mandy and Katherine still have their occupations and their schedule is discussed and taken into consideration.&nbsp; I allow them to work because it pleases me. That Saturday, I held court on Sarah's offences with the girls present: Mandy, Katherine and Minnie, naked and collared, made to assume the position, which is only proper.&nbsp; Sarah was stripped of her clothing and secured to the pole in a standing position; her hands above her head, her legs hobbled at her ankles.

Sarah was required to confess her transgressions against Minnie and then offer her a public apology. I then removed my garrison belt and applied it to Sarah's buttocks; two forceful cracks for each offence against Minnie.&nbsp; I let it be known that this behavior will not be tolerated by any of my girls against another.&nbsp; 

I released Sarah from the pole and she immediately assumed the position next to the other girls. I adjured court and directed them to heel and then stand.&nbsp; 

Assuming the position is common slave etiquette practiced by the Sanctorum. The slave girl will kneel with her hands flat on the floor, crossed, with her forehead on her hands.&nbsp; Her ass will be higher then her head, her feet will be together. To heel is for the girl is to kneel with her back straight, arms straight and crossed in front, with her head up looking at her Master or Mistress.&nbsp; 

To my surprise and satisfaction, Sarah still crying, walked over to Minnie, offered her hand, and quietly apologized again.&nbsp; Minnie not only took Sarah's hand accepting her apology, but actually hugged Sarah, tears starting to form in her eyes as well. Looking at Mandy and Katherine's faces I knew what would happen next; I went upstairs to let them have their moment, well satisfied with the outcome; Minnie showing genuine humility; one of my favorite attributes in a slave girl.&nbsp; Sarah's transgression was expunged with her punishment; I will not bring it up again.

That evening, I went downstairs to check on Minnie for the first time. Up until then, the girls took care of her needs: I ignored her, never going to the basement.&nbsp; Minnie immediately assumed the position. "Minnie, heel."&nbsp; When she complied, I gently touched her face resting my hand on the top of her head.&nbsp; This was only the second time that I talked to her and the first time I touched her or showed her any affection since the Sanctorum returned her to me.&nbsp; "You do not have permission to speak to me."&nbsp; "Tomorrow you will be allowed upstairs during the day for the rest of your sentence."  I added, continuing to caress her face and hair and looking into her beautiful green eyes.&nbsp; 

"You will eat your meals alone in the kitchen and then serve us ours in the dinning room "You will take cooking lessons from Sarah and help her clean the house"&nbsp; " Every Saturday morning, you will attend the household meeting" "The girls and I will discuss your progress; you will remain silent and listen."&nbsp; 

"You may use one of the girl's two bathrooms, specifically the toilet and sink."&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will be allowed to take one cold shower a day.... alone."&nbsp; " Your use of hot water will be restricted to hand washing, food preparation and house cleaning." "Your sleeping arrangements will remain the same.... for now." 

"Go to your sleeping mat and lie down."&nbsp;  Minnie quickly complied.&nbsp; I attached her leash to the pole and covered her with her quilt and rubbed her head one final time.&nbsp; That was the second time I left her crying by her pole. 

Sunday morning Minnie was to be allowed upstairs for the first time.&nbsp; It was Mandy's turn to share my bed that previous night and she liked to cuddle and have me play with her hair when I awoke, followed by breakfast in bed just for the two of us, served by Katherine or Sarah when I called for it.&nbsp; 

Mandy was full of questions as were Sarah and Katherine, they all being excited about Minnie being allowed upstairs. This too pleased me greatly; I made an exception and we all had breakfast in bed together. 

I answered their questions; implemented most of their suggestions, then gave them their instructions, receiving many hugs and kisses.&nbsp; Afterwards, Mandy and I showered together while Katherine and Sarah had their showers, dressed and waited for us in the library.

I sent Sarah to bring Minnie upstairs, while I waited in the library, sitting in my favorite chair, my feet on the matching ottoman.
Katherine and Mandy met them at the top of the stairs and then escorted Minnie to their bathroom and dressing room to get her presentable for my viewing. 

From the beginning, Minnie was given a toothbrush, toothpaste, dental floss, antiseptic mouthwash and castile soap for her personal needs. She was allowed to wash in the slop-sink, as was Princess.
Now Minnie was given shampoo and conditioner and allowed a cold shower. Next she was given a full body wax and is told that I will allow her to shave her armpits and legs.&nbsp; 

Minnie covered her mouth during the wax, tears running down her face; how the tables are turned!&nbsp; Minnie always kept her public hair full, but trimmed and shaped; shaved vaginas were for slaves...need I say more?

One Saturday, during our household meeting, Katherine told me that Minnie hated needles and that was why she never wears earrings or had her ears pierced. Each of my beautiful girls was given a gift of an identical pair of 18-karat gold hoop earrings. The earrings are a symbol of their bondage and they are required to wear them except when showering or sleeping. 

They share a communal jewelry chest that is located on the second floor in a bedroom room I converted into a dressing room; complete with floor to ceiling mirrors, and a walk- in -closet. The closet contains identical items of clothing in each of the girl's sizes, including Minnie's.&nbsp; The room also has vanity tables and chairs.&nbsp; 

The antique jewelry chest is the size of a large chest of drawers. It is filled exclusively with sterling silver jewelry, earrings, bracelets, necklaces, pins, broaches and hair accessories: combs and barrettes. 

The chest contains just about every semi-precious stone available: turquoise, ambers, garnets, amethysts, and onyx: lapis lazuli, tanzanite, sapphires and citrines: tourmaline and spinals, corals, jade, carnelian, jasper and aquamarine, to name a few and illustrate the variety the chest contains. Every piece is duplicated in four: Minerva must earn access to the chest, as she must her 18-karat hoops.&nbsp; 

They enjoy dressing and modeling for me, as I delight in watching them. Having two or three beautiful female companions, while out in public, regardless of the activity shared is most gratifying.&nbsp; Even at home on most nights we dress for dinner and eat in my formal dining room; they may make a selection of jewelry from the chest to go with their ensemble. 

I make time for these life's pleasures, they follow their schedule, help each other out and get along like sisters; sisters in bondage, but sisters; As I have said before, I have my own methods.

This Sunday morning, Minnie will not have her ears pierced. Katherine will perform the procedure; Minnie will have her vertical clitoral hood pierced for an 18-karat ball closure ring; all my girls wear one.&nbsp; Minnie fainted twice during the procedure and the girls teased her about it.



When Minnie gained her composure, and stopped crying, they had her stand in front of the full-length mirror in their dressing room. They showed her their gold closure rings, then hugged and congratulated her, they being proud of theirs.

Masters and Mistresses of the Sanctorum have offered me millions for Minnie. Many of them are cruel taskmasters. Some Mistresses offering to purchase her are formal rivals jealous of her beauty. They would abuse and degrade her for no other reason then they can, the atrocities they would heap upon her........... 

To other Dominants, Minnie is merely a novelty, a status symbol to amuse themselves and then discard.&nbsp; She could be sold or traded multiple times, the temperament of her new owner, the luck of the draw. Fortunately most Masters and Grand Masters are of my vein. We work diligently to sanction, purge or if necessary, terminate these undesirables. 

In my opinion Minnie used her crop far too freely on Mandy and Katherine, and then she mostly ignored them in her quest to become Grand Mistress.&nbsp; Those two months alone in the basement gave her much to think about, as well as myself.

Princess has been my slave the longest and knows my mind. I telling her that I was disappointed in her and telling her I expected better of her, no doubt hurt her more then the belt.&nbsp; Sarah loves me as I love her. My Katherine...my Mandy, our house would be empty without them. In the short time I have owned them, I have grown to love them as well, but each in different way then Sarah; I can't put it into words and I pride myself in logic and reason.

I have known Minnie the longest; first as Minerva, who I met at her dance school after my acrimonious divorce; then as my dance partner; we won many competitions together; Finally as Mistress Minerva of the Sanctorum; my salvation and blessing.&nbsp; Minerva was my marvelous teacher, my mentor and part time lover. Minerva, I loved from the first. How foolish, how weak and damn obstinate.... prideful...asinine and obtuse, we both were, Master, Mistress.... afraid of three words.&nbsp; I have forgiven Minnie for her betrayal.

Yet, a Master I remain with responsibility to the Sanctorum and the women that I love. This is the life we chose, Minnie and I. We are of the Sanctorum. We must play our parts; until death do us part. I will keep my word to former Grand Mistress Maude and Grand Master Arthur.&nbsp; I will work with him to secure the values of the Sanctorum. 


After awhile there was a knock on the library door, "Come in ladies" I answered in response to the knock. Katherine slid the double pocket doors open and entered the room first in a beautiful sea green dress, her hair and makeup done to perfection. She had selected a silver and green tourmaline bracelet, ring, and chain with a heart shaped pendant to go with the dress. Next was Mandy in the identical dress in pale blue, choosing lapis lazuli for her stone; hair and make-up perfect.&nbsp; 

Then my Sarah in a pale rose version, her hair up in a French twist with two silver and red garnet hair combs and a red garnet bracelet, make-up, perfect; blood red lipstick, luscious.&nbsp; Minnie entered last, naked and collared. Her red hair freshly washed and her face scrubbed, pink and glowing with health.&nbsp; 

While confined to the basement, and per my instructions, the girls saw to it that she received good healthy meals and multiple vitamin/ mineral supplements as well as requiring Minnie to do her stretching and exercises, most times doing them with her.

&nbsp; As they each entered, they assumed the position, in a neat row, right to left, all four girls barefoot. "You may heel ladies"
I put my coffee cup on the coaster, got up from the chair and walked to Katherine. "You may stand Katherine my dear and I must say you look lovely" Katherine put her arms around my neck and kissed my mouth. "Thank you Michael" She replied smiling, followed by my arms around her waist and then kissing her mouth, as she tried to speak&nbsp; "If you want".... Kiss..."your lunch".... Kiss..."on time".... Kiss, Kiss...."you will have to let me go".... Kiss...."So I can set the table!"
 
"I'm sorry, what did you say?" "I was rather busy and my mind was elsewhere." I said, Kiss.  Putting her hand in over of my mouth, "I said if you want your lunch on time you have to let me go to set the table." Katherine repeated, laughing. "Very well then, don't let me stop you. "I said, smiling and letting go; Katherine left.&nbsp; 

"Mandy" I said offering her my hand, helping her stand.&nbsp; "That color brings out your blue eyes, my little peach" "Is my shirt pressed, my black shoes shined; my suit laid out?" " Have you chosen a tie for me?" I asked. "I'm not telling you." she said, pouting "Why won't you tell me?" "Because you have not kissed me yet" she answered. "I already kissed you earlier, peaches, you were with me all last night." "That does not count."  Mandy replied.&nbsp; "I vote with Mandy" Sarah added.&nbsp; "See, it's two against one, Master you lose!" 

"Well then Mandy.... Princes, we will see about that." I will take you both on!" With a girl in each arm, I received many hugs and kisses, each girl trying to out do the other. Finally, declaring a truce, I sent them on their way, closing the doors behind them.

"Minnie you may stand."&nbsp; Minnie put her hand to the base of her throat, a gesture that I first taught Sarah, then the other girls, requesting permission to speak. "No you may not speak." "Put your hands behind your head."&nbsp; "Very nice, leave them there" I walked around her, looking at her from all angles. Cupping her breasts and stroking them, feeling her nipples grow hard, I said, "My magnificent Minnie" "Your breasts are as I remember them; round, firm and perfect." "Spread your legs for your Master."  
I stroked her smooth hairless vagina commenting, "I like it better this way."&nbsp; 

" Do you remember your little joke, when you shaved me." "You said that you didn't want hair in your mouth when you went down on me." "When it was your turn, you refused to let me shave you saying only female slaves were shaved." "I was a good sport about it." "I now prefer it that way"
"It is shaved again "My girls prefer it that way." "It is such a little concession to them, yet pleases them greatly." 

Feeling her wetness, I commented, "I do not recall you being so easily aroused Minnie, it must be your closure ring." I added, stroking her vagina, parting her lips.... touching her clitoris.&nbsp; "You know my dear, you have a beautiful pussy."&nbsp; "Luscious and plump, meant to be stroked and probed." "Assume the position"
I continued stroking her clitoris, feeling her juices flow, aroused at my touch. " "A most vulnerable position, don't you agree."? "I could enter you right now my girl, or I could use the crop on your exposed bottom." "I still have yours."&nbsp;  I added, removing her crop from my inner robe pocket. 

"As I recall, you were quite fond of using it on your girls for any reason." "Not that you beat them to leave welts or cuts.... but as you often told me, "To motivate".............to motivate."&nbsp; "You are a very intelligent women Minnie, as well as a beautiful one; a Harvard Graduate."&nbsp; "To your credit, you observe everything, take in every detail; you analyze everything." "I will not beat you with your crop." "You have done nothing wrong." You have not irritated or annoyed me since you have been here." "I actually am quite pleased with you." I added, dropping the crop to the floor.

"On the night that the Sanctorum returned you to me, I told you that you would have to earn the right to serve me."&nbsp; "The fact that you forgave Sarah was your first step." "Your humility makes you the girl's equal now." "You are no longer their servants." "You will work beside them and learn." 

"I will take you into my confidence again." "You will not repeat this to the other girls, although. I am sure that they know it." "You are the most beautiful of my girls." " "In fact, you are the most beautiful woman I have ever known." "My girls are not jealous of one another and I love them for that." 

"I have been thinking much of you these past months Minerva."&nbsp;&nbsp; "How foolish, how weak and damn obstinate.... prideful...asinine and obtuse, we both were, Master, Mistress.... afraid of three words we knew to be true."&nbsp; "We are of the Sanctorum, you and I." "This is the life we both chose of our own free will."

 " I have a responsibility to uphold the values of the Sanctorum." "Order and discipline will be maintained in my household." "You know the absolute importance of this having been a Mistress." "I have a duty to the welfare of my girls; in return for their loyalty, and obedience.... their love." 

"Now for your betrayal...I forgive you." "I will never bring up the subject again." "Your punishment shall remain." "Your transgression shall be expunged when the terms of your punishment ends." 

"Stand and face your Master" "You have beautiful eyes, beautiful emerald green eyes and I never told you just how beautiful I thought they were." "I should have told you long before this."  Closing mine, I gently ran my hands through her short red hair, then caressed her face, neck; moving to her shoulders, down her back to her trim waist, stopping at her shapely ass and squeezing it lightly. I moved back up, caressing and stroking, until I again was holding her face in my hands. Sighing with pleasure, I opened my eyes and kissed her beautiful face.

Minnie reached up and touched her cheek where I kissed her looking down. I could see her bottom lip quiver if she wanted to say something, or was about to cry, but she quickly mastered her emotions and looked up. I could see suppressed anger flash in her green eyes, like a hot green flame.

 "You have permission to speak."&nbsp; I offered. "You may speak freely without fear of punishment." I was giving her the opportunity to vent.&nbsp; "You can be such a bastard, Master."&nbsp; "That being said, I give you my word I will do my best to please you.," she added. "I have no where else to go." 

"May I kiss you Master?"  Minnie asked sweetly.&nbsp; "You certainly may." I answered, crossing my arms, guessing what would come next. "I've changed my mind." "I don't think I shall."  Minnie said, tossing her head, as she used too when her hair was long.   "May I be dismissed Master, I have my duties to perform?"

"You may address me as Michael." "After all, we do have a history together."  I offered. "Oh no, Master, that would not be proper."
"I will certainly do so if you order me to, Master."&nbsp; 

"You are dismissed Minnie."&nbsp;&nbsp; Sarah is probably in the kitchen." Just as she reached the door, I said " And Minnie."&nbsp; "Yes Master" she said stopping and turning to look at me. "You are welcome."
." &nbsp; Minnie continued walking, swearing under her breath, in Gaelic, a language that she was most fluent being Irish on her mother's side and taught to her on grandmother's knee.&nbsp; "Minnie!"..........."Yes Master" she said, stopping again, turning and smiling sweetly. "Please bring me another cup of coffee, you know how I like."

I knew from the start how obstinate she could be...and impertinent if given the chance to speak freely when we were alone. I took it for granted that Minnie knew better to be impertinent in front of the girls.&nbsp; I also knew in my heart she would eventually come around.&nbsp; If she hated me, she would have told me so in no uncertain terms.&nbsp; I do not desire to break her spirit. I have no interest in a fawning drone.&nbsp; I can wait her out.... I have three other girls to pleasure me.

 Minnie always enjoyed making love to me as a free woman, but now, Minnie will never beg for sex, no matter how much she wants it. I can just take her if I desire, but I do not want her that way. Minnie will figure a way around it to save what dignity she has left.... when she is comfortable with her new found title: slave, and when she is ready. 

Approximately seven months into her sentence was another turning point for her. Minnie was true to her word and she did try very hard to fit in doing her share of the household chores and more. I was spending more time with her.&nbsp; 

I made it a point to kiss her every morning and evening.&nbsp; When I walked by her, I often touched her, my hands lingering most intimately. Minnie never returned my kisses or my touches, although I could tell she enjoyed them.&nbsp; Minnie always addressed me as Master. 

The turning point came on a hot Friday afternoon in June.&nbsp; Katherine and Mandy were at work. Katherine would be home at her regular time.
 It was the wedding season and Mandy's Salon, my Salon was booked late into the evenings for women and girls getting their hair styled for upcoming weddings.&nbsp; Mandy would not be home until 8:00 PM.&nbsp; It was money in my pocket, but it was not as if I needed it; I was now much wealthier then before.&nbsp; Grand Master Arthur was true to his word when he told me, "the fifty will remember your generosity."&nbsp; Grand Master Arthur introduced me to people and allowed me to invest in private ventures that allowed me to increase my wealth five-fold. 

Sarah and Minnie were canning blueberries in the kitchen. There were flats of blueberries stacked on the back porch, along with new unopened boxes of canning jars.&nbsp; Sarah took my pickup truck to town, to buy more sugar, pectin and labels for the jars of pie filling and preserves that she was planning to put up.&nbsp; 

Minnie was in the kitchen, taking them out of the baskets and washing them, putting them into colanders to drain and then be sorted for spoils; finally to be put into large bowls.&nbsp; The counters and kitchen table, kitchen chairs were covered with huge bowls of fresh blueberries, waiting for Sarah to show Minnie the next step in the process.

I was outside splitting wood for my fireplaces and wood stove. Our central air was down; I had it apart earlier that morning trying to fix it, but the compressor was shot. I called the manufacturer's 1-800 number and ordered the part; it would be delivered Monday. I had a load of small logs delivered the day before and was enjoying my workout. The temperature was in the high eighties and it was very muggy.&nbsp; 

I was stripped to the waist and perspiring heavily with the good sweat of manual labor. Minnie was in and out of the house replenishing my pitcher of ice water with fresh ice and checking frequently to make sure the water was fresh and cold.&nbsp; I did not ask her to do this, I generally drank from the hose; I am not complaining, I am pleased with her thoughtfulness. 

At one point I heard a scream, followed by a crash. I dropped my splitting maul and ran into the house to see if she was hurt.&nbsp; I found Minnie sitting on the floor
in a pile of spilled, and now squashed blueberries.&nbsp; When Minnie is in the kitchen preparing food, or is cleaning with harsh chemicals, she is allowed appropriate clothing.... common sense. 

Today because of the oppressive heat, all she was wearing to wash berries was an apron.

There were blueberries everywhere and empty overturned bowls littering floor.&nbsp; Bowls were overturned on the counter; but it gets better, the kitchen faucet was broken at the base; water was shooting up to the ceiling, splashing, then running down the walls, spilling over the counters onto the floor; I was trampling blueberries trying to get to her.&nbsp; Moving the overturned chair she was standing on before she fell, I knelt beside her in the mashed blueberries.

"Minerva, are you hurt?" "I'm fine, look at the mess I just made."&nbsp; "Are you sure you are not hurt?"&nbsp; "I'm fine, it was an accident."&nbsp; Helping her to her feet, and trying not to laugh, I asked "What were you doing standing on a chair when there is a step-stool in the pantry?" "I was trying to get a bowl down." Minnie answered, looking down. "It was heavy and my hands were wet." "It slipped out of my hands, and when I tired to catch it I fell and broke our sink." "Accidents happen, I'm just glad you are not hurt."

I squatted to reach underneath the sink and turn off the water at the shut off valve; the handle broke off at the stem when I tried to force it.

Getting up, I turned and saw that Minnie had taken off her ruined apron and was now trying to reach a spilled bowl of berries that ended up under the table; she slipped on the mess on the floor, landing on her stomach; now she was covered front and back, the berries staining her beautiful smooth skin, swearing under her breath in Gaelic. 

 I started laughing and couldn't stop. "Stop laughing at me."  "This is not at all funny." "I have to clean this mess.&nbsp; She added, her eyes flashing with anger. 

"Yes, you.... ha, ha, I, ha, ha.... you're right it is not funny."  I answered, trying to stifle the next laugh and keep a straight face, but not succeeding "It is hysterical and you look ridiculous!" "Ha, ha ha ha ha...I...ha, ha, ha, can't look at you." and I turned my back to her just shaking with laughter.

 Minnie came up behind me, her hands full of squashed blueberries and smashed them on my shoulders, pushing her hands up my neck into my hair.&nbsp; I turned to her in disbelief. Smiling, Minnie reached for my face with her slender hands full of berries and rubbed them on my cheeks, painting my mouth, neck and chest with berry juice and pulp as if I were her canvas.

Minnie reached down for more, this time rubbing the blueberries on her mouth, neck and breasts; fascinated, all I could do was watch.

Putting her arms around my neck, Minnie gave me a deep, lingering kiss, tasting like blueberries.&nbsp; Giving her my best stern look, and covered in blueberries I admonished "I should take my belt to you for that." "I don't understand?"  She said innocently, "Do you mean for kissing you, Master?" 

 "I asked you for your permission." You certainly did not." I replied.  "I most certainly did."&nbsp; "When did you ask permission to kiss me?"&nbsp; "The day you first brought me upstairs to the library."&nbsp; "That was over five months ago." I replied. "Do you withdraw your permission for me to kiss you, Master?" 

"That depends, do you wish to kiss me again Minnie?" "I don't believe I shall." She answered, saucily.  "Now you are being impertinent, you are certain to get the belt." "You gave me a choice to kiss or not kiss you, therefore I have tacit approval." She retorted.&nbsp; "Good point" I admitted.&nbsp; 

You also gave me permission to speak freely without fear of punishment, and to date, you have not withdrawn that either." She retorted.

"I most definitely did not at any time, five months, or five minutes ago give you permission to cover me with blueberries; what say you to that?" 

"I have changed my mind, I want to kiss you again, Michael." "What about the blueberries, Minerva?"  "I will lick and kiss them off of you."&nbsp; 

I put my arms around her waist.&nbsp; Minnie put her arms around my neck and started kissing and licking my neck and face.&nbsp; Before she could get to the rest of me, I remembered the geyser from the sink. "Do you want to make love to me Minerva?"

"Yes, Thank you for asking Master." "You are welcome Minnie."  I said kissing and licking her breasts, tasting the blueberries.&nbsp; 

"But first I have to take care of something." I said letting go of her and walking to the sink. "The handle on the shut off valve broke off." "There, that should work."  I said, as I placed a large, heavy ceramic bowl over the broken faucet diverting the water into the sink. "But... She started to say, when I interrupted, placing my hand over her mouth, shaking my head.  "Go upstairs to my bathroom and wait me there."  I ordered, "I will write Sarah a note with instructions that we are not to be disturbed.  

As I was writing the note, Minnie reached around my waist and pushed two handfuls of blueberries down the front of my pants, then ran upstairs, laughing.&nbsp; As I was finishing the note, I heard my truck pull up by the back porch.&nbsp; I quickly ran to the top of the stairs, then stopped to listen, counting to myself "1...2.... 3.... 4...5...6...7...8...9...bingo" I heard a scream, but no crash.&nbsp; I joined Minnie in the bathroom, closing the door behind me.



"You may consider yourself on furlough starting now until tomorrow, Saturday, June18, 2005 at 11:59 PM, Eastern Standard Time."&nbsp; "This evening you will be allowed to share my bed." "This will be contingent of course on you being able to read my mind. "


"May I shower with you Michael... before we make love?"
"Of course you may, it will be my pleasure, and I hope yours as well."

"Before we shower may I ask you a question?"&nbsp; "Ask away?"
"May I help Sarah clean the kitchen first?"&nbsp; "My dear Minnie, not only may you, I will help as well."&nbsp; "The sooner the mess is clean, the sooner we shall shower." "Thank you Michael?"&nbsp; "You are welcome." 

We made short work of the kitchen.&nbsp; I went downstairs to shut the water off in the basement. There is a second shut off valve in the basement just below the kitchen sink; I planned on installing a new faucet assembly the next day.

We took a long tepid shower together, soaping each other down, washing and conditioning each other's hair, and toweling one another off.&nbsp; 

Minnie went down on me in the bedroom, licking and sucking my penis, taking my balls into her mouth, something my other girls had never done, and something I never had experienced; this trick would remain Minnie's.&nbsp; I came in her mouth and she swallowed all of my semen, and then licked me clean. In the past, I always wore a condom; This time, I didn't think of it, and she did not ask for one. I returned the favor, going down on her now bald snatch.&nbsp; Much like Mandy.

 Minnie was all over the bed, as I licked and sucked with my lips and tongue, with a new twist, my finger in her ass applying opposite pressure: she came, and she came in waves: not only was my face wet from her juices, so were the sheets, we had to change them before our nap together; We slept until 8:00PM.&nbsp; Then we dressed and went downstairs.

When I said we dressed, and I use the term loosely, all Minnie was wearing one of my white sleeveless tee shirts that were much too large for her falling down past her hips.&nbsp; I was wearing another white tee along with boxer shorts. 

Katherine and Sarah were waiting on the back patio in their panties and woman's sleeveless tees. We all sat outside drinking homemade Sangria waiting for Mandy to arrive with the Chinese that we were having for our late dinner.

Being on furlough, Minnie was allowed a few glasses of Sangria as well; Between wine and dinner. Minnie became quite relaxed and talkative.

Minnie was quite animated when she described how she gave me 
"blue balls" and everybody laughed.&nbsp; They brought a portable CD-Player outside and played the greatest hits from the 1960's, 1970's and 1980's. Soon they were up dancing with one another, mostly fast dances; the slow ones were for me, one girl at a time.

Minnie shared my bed that evening and I tried something on her that Katherine liked. Katherine likes it a little bit rough.&nbsp; I will pull her hair during intercourse, just as her orgasm is at its crest. Katherine also enjoys being taken in "the position", on the floor of my bedroom at the foot of the bed.&nbsp; 

Katherine likes to receive anal sex in "the position" best.&nbsp; I will stroke and caress her pussy while I am performing anal sex with her, slapping her shapely ass with my hand until she comes. Katherine will clean my manhood with a washcloth afterwards, but not for vaginal sex; she loves the taste of our mingled juices; next she will perform oral sex on me and I will use her hair for my love reins to control her exuberance and guide her to suit my pleasure.&nbsp; 

Katherine likes to masturbate when giving me head, and I allow her to play with herself until she comes a second time.&nbsp; None of my girls are allowed to masturbate without my permission. This is an absolute mandate and they will get the belt on Saturday morning for violating this mandate. They will achieve their orgasm by me or with my permission while I watch. 

When I first acquired Katherine and Mandy, I suspected that one or the other; possibly both might be bisexual.&nbsp; And my suspicions were correct.&nbsp; They are both highly sexed women needing an outlet for their sexuality. I have no problem with this; it rather turns me on.

They also have a need to be dominated and will live within the rules of my household. Like masturbation, girl on girl sex is forbidden without my permission. The forbidden fruit is much more sweet when withheld. 

I believe that I mentioned " orgies during the day".&nbsp; That is something that I reserve for the three of us, Mandy, Katherine and myself.

Sarah told me in private that she would rather not participate; nothing would be gained by forcing her because she is obedient, compliant and affectionate in all other things.&nbsp; I also doubt that Minnie would be much interested with sex with women, although her past behavior in the kitchen and the bedroom does leave a touch of doubt.

Minnie has never been one to be spontaneous; her behavior in the kitchen was a wonderful surprise. In fact she was quite reserved. In the past, before, we had intercourse, she always went in the bathroom, closing the door for privacy in order to get ready, she said to fix her makeup, hair etc....In retrospect; It is likely that she had to apply some type of lube such as KY-Jelly to facilitate intercourse and we always used a condom. 

I wonder if she was holding back or even faking her orgasms in some cases.&nbsp; I do not remember her being so wet before, during or after intercourse.
I believe to some degree in her quest for wealth and power, she suppressed her sexuality or had trouble sharing it with a man. Perhaps her slavery has somewhat freed her sexual inhibitions. I suspect this is the case.


Minnie always insisted in being in total control...but at what cost?

Friday night, I made Minnie assume the position on the floor in front of my bed.&nbsp; She was a little tipsy from the Sangria, which was fine.&nbsp; I made sure that she received more then her share of the slow dances.&nbsp; Minnie was very affectionate while we danced and I received many intimate touches and kisses.&nbsp; I held her close when we danced, missing having my hands in her long hair, as it was before her first forced punishment haircut.

I probed her vagina with my fingers; then with my mouth and tongue. Soon she was wet and moaning, moving her hips, trying to push her vagina into her face as I licked
her clitoris.&nbsp; When I knew she was about to peak, I slowed down, prolonging the inevitable. "Why did you stop Michael, it feels so good?" "I am considering something."  I answered. "Can't you lick while you are considering?" 

"I am considering amending your furlough to include one day
each week until the end of your sentence."  I said, continuing to probe her clitoris again briefly and adding, "It is contingent upon you reading my mind." "Please Master."&nbsp; "Please what my marvelous Minnie."  I said stopping&nbsp; 

"You can be such a bastard, Michael, oh yes that feels so good." "Please don't stop."  As I started stroking it again "Yes I am my dear and you?" "Who are you?" "I am your slave Master and I want to come."  I entered her from behind, while sticking my finger deep in her anus; listening to her gasp, then moan even louder as I increased my thrusts savaging her vagina with my manhood. "What else are you Minnie?" "I am a bitch." "I am your bitch.... oh God.... fuck me harder Michael...fuck your bitch harder.... fuck me harder you bastard, make me come."&nbsp; Minnie's orgasm was incredible, I never her heard her make so much noise; and as soon as she was sated, I came soon after. I lay down next to her on the rug, stated and content. "Come here my little bitch." "The most beautiful of my girls, I want to taste your lips."

Minnie lay down beside me on the floor and I took her in my arms. When I tried to kiss her she put her hand over my mouth, shaking her head. Minnie closed her eyes, sighing. She ran her fingers through my hair, and then caressed my face and neck. Minnie rubbed my shoulders, her hands working their way down my back to my ass, which she squeezed. She reversed the process until her hands were again in my hair; Minnie kissed my cheek, opened her eyes then kissed my mouth, long and deep.

"Can we go to bed now Michael?" "Yes that is a great idea."  I said smiling at her. "I am looking forward to having you with me all night."&nbsp; "I am going to brush my teeth and use the bathroom." "Get the bed ready and feel free to use any of the bathrooms if you must."

While we were on the patio that night, I observed that Sarah was inside the house for quite a long time getting ice.&nbsp; I noticed that the bed was made, bedspread and all. I suspect that she may have put silk sheets on the bed, my pretty girl.... my thoughtful and kind Princess.

Minnie walked into the bathroom, smiling as I was leaving and mussed my hair as I walked by.&nbsp; When she returned to the bedroom, Minnie stopped to run her hand over the silk sheets. "Did you have the bed made with silk sheets to surprise me Michael? "I think it was Sarah while we were slow dancing out on the patio."  I answered, lying on my back, while Minnie got in snuggling up next to me. "Michael?" "Yes Minnie." I answered.&nbsp; "May I go to the hardware store tomorrow?"

"I would love to take you to the hardware store, thank you for asking."&nbsp; Rubbing my chest with her hand she asked, "May we stop somewhere and get coffee?" "We can leave early and have breakfast if you like, Minnie.  I said, closing my eyes." "That would be wonderful, Michael."  And she gave me a little hug.&nbsp; 

"May I dress up nice for you and wear makeup." "Of course you may." "May I have my ears pierced?"&nbsp; "You want your ears pierced?" "You are afraid of needles remember." "You will hold my hand when Katherine does it, then I will not mind it so much." "Fine anything you want within reason."  I replied. "I need to get some sleep and so do you." "No more questions." 

"Michael?" "I said no more questions." "Master, this is not a question, I have something to tell you...are you listening?
"I know that you love me."  Now that got my attention and I rolled
over and looked at her. "Do you want me to tell you how I know that you love me?"&nbsp; "Of course I want you to tell me."&nbsp; "I don't 
think I shall."&nbsp; She said, rolling over, facing away from me. 
I slapped her ass with my hand, hard enough to make her yelp.&nbsp; And she rolled back over smiling and I grabbed holding her in place.

"Minerva you can be such and impertinent bitch at times!" 
"Yes I am Master, I admit it, I am a bitch at times, but I am your
bitch.... your slave." "That's how I know that you love me Michael". "Only a bastard like you could ever love an impertinent bitch like me." "Then be a good little bitch and go to sleep, Minnie." "Thank you for finally saying it Master, I love you too."


Minnie and I had our breakfast in bed served to us by Sarah.
When Sarah walked in, Minnie jumped up taking the tray, from her putting in down on the chair, then hugging Sarah, and thanking her for the silk sheets.

"May Sarah have breakfast with us Michael?" "The more the merrier."  I answered.&nbsp; "Thank you Michael."  They all said in unison as Katherine and Mandy walked in from around the corner with two larger trays of the same breakfast: fresh honeydew melon, yogurt, walnuts and coffee.

After breakfast we had our household meeting in the bedroom.
It was a short one. I announced that Minnie would be sharing my bed one day a week, and they would work out a schedule.
During that day Minnie would be allowed full privileges as one of my girls. The punishment haircuts would stop and Minnie would be allowed to grow her hair out in stages; Mandy would determine the appropriate cuts to grow it out gracefully, she being the expert in such matters.

After the meeting, they all went to the dressing room to help Minnie get ready. I showered, shaved, and put on a pair of blue jeans, white tee shirt and a colorful Hawaiian to wear in the
hardware store, coffee shop, or perhaps the perfume counter in the 
Mall to select Minnie's soon to be signature fragrance.

Sarah's is vanilla; I love the smell of vanilla and it is perfect for my sweet pretty girl. With her fair skin and blond hair and petite figure, I chose a light dainty flowery scent for Mandy. Katherine, my voluptuous Katherine's is herbal and flowers with a touch of citrus.&nbsp; Minnie would be wearing the one she has always worn, musky and rich with a hint of sweetness, the scent of the woman I have always loved.

 Of all the scents in the world, this is the one I will chose for her and the one that she will wear; I am sure she will understand the significance. As for myself, Old Spice cologne is good enough for me.

I had the kitchen faucet completely dismantled and had taken the measurements of the sink to select a new one. I was sitting at the kitchen table with the old parts in a box waiting for Minnie.&nbsp; 

Minnie walked in looking lovely the light cream muslin sundress that she chose for me. She was wearing makeup and her short hair was styled to look fuller. 

"Do you like my dress Michael?"&nbsp; "I love everything about you, your dress, your hair and makeup.... you"  "May I have my ears pierced now?"&nbsp; "Yes, get Katherine and she can do it here in the kitchen."&nbsp; "Will I get my hoops this morning?"  She asked, hoping that I would say yes. "No, just the stainless steel posts for no; I have another surprise in mind?" "What are you getting me Michael?" "If I told you it wouldn't be a surprise.

Minnie sat perfectly still in the chair with her eyes closed while 
Katherine pierced her ears, squeezing my hand in a death grip.
When Katherine was finished and the studs were in I kissed her ears and told her she looked lovely.

We went to the hardware store first, and then went to Tim Horton's for coffee and a bagel.&nbsp; I took Minnie to Macy's to the makeup counter and let her choose any makeup that she needed, telling her in front of the salesgirl,
"Your taste in makeup and clothing is impeccable Minerva."
"Purchase anything you need and do not worry about the price."
"Here, take my credit card, I will meet you in the bookstore; you may take your time."  And she did. 


Three hours later, Minnie arrived at the bookstore carrying three large Macy's shopping bags.&nbsp; "Let's lock the bags in the trunk and then I will take you to get your surprise." "But I thought my makeup was my surprise!  "Your makeup is to make yourself even more beautiful for me."

We locked the bags in the trunk, and then we went back to Macy's.
When we arrived at the perfume counter, I recognized the same girl that waited on Sarah and I when I purchased her perfume.
"You know Minnie, each of my Ladies has their special perfume that I picked just for them with much thought and consideration."
"I am aware of that Michael, what did you chose for me?"
" Jovan Musk Oil of course." "Michael, that is the one I prefer."
"You have worn that scent ever since I have known you my dear."

I was right she did recognize the significance. Minnie leaned over and kissing me, whispering what she was going to do to me when we got home.
 

Minnie did backslide once during her sentence, and received the
belt for her impulsive mistake.

It was a Wednesday, just three weeks before her sentence was finally over. Minnie knew where I kept the pair 18- karat hoop earrings that she would receive on her birthday, the day all her restrictions will be lifted.

I was called away on business for the Sanctorum. I would be gone for three days. I was taking Sarah with me and we would be staying on Grand Master Arthur's Estate in Martha's Vineyard.
It was in regard to a Grand Master who had killed one of his slaves and refused to appear before the Tribunal for judgment.

My expertise was required to help circumvent his security system.
I would be meeting with three other security experts, all of them Master's and we would study the schematics to determine the best plan to temporally disable the state of the art security system.&nbsp; We were there for technical advise only.&nbsp; None of us knew the identity of the Grand Master who would be terminated, My best guess; the autopsy would show natural causes or an unfortunate accident.

The official business would take only a day, and the other Masters would leave. Grand Master Arthur requested that I specifically bring Sarah.&nbsp; A frequent visitor to my home, Arthur loved Sarah's cooking, particularly her raisin, apple and shoo fly pies.&nbsp; 
Sarah would be doing all of the cooking, all traditional Amish
dishes. 

We would surprise Arthur by bringing him a dozen each of his favorite pies for his freezer, as well as enough pies for the day meeting and the duration of our stay.&nbsp; Sarah was very fond of Arthur, often referring to him as "such a polite, kind old gentleman" and was delighted to cook for him; And he was a gentleman. Arthur looked the benevolent old grandfather in a Disney movie in his three-piece suits, with a chain and fob on his vest, the pocket watch he always carried: his signature red carnation in his lapel. 

Always the gentleman, Arthur was polite and gracious with my ladies when visiting, his funny stories at dinner, making them laugh. But when it came to enforcing the mandates of the Sanctorum, Arthur could be ruthless, the blood of many on his hands, the red carnation a reminder and warning.

Minerva understood the significance and meaning of the red carnation. We do not speak of it. I consider Arthur a good friend.

Minnie was alone during the day while the girls were working.
Because of her added responsibility, I allowed her to sleep in the Master Bedroom while we were away. Minnie followed all of my directions while we were gone, and completed all of her chores and more.

Minnie decided that she would wear her 18-karat hoop earrings while the girls were away at work; and put them back before they got home.&nbsp; As luck would have it, she managed to lose one.&nbsp; To her credit, she did tell Katherine and Mandy and they spent the remainder of that day and the entire next day looking for it.

Katherine and Mandy met us in the driveway and welcomed us home helping us with the luggage. I was glad to be home again
surrounded by my girls, my family. "Where is Minnie?" It's not like her not to be here, is she ill?"  Katherine and Minnie looked at one another and Katherine spoke first "Minnie is in the library, Michael." "She has something to tell you."&nbsp; "I will go and talk with her shortly." "Have you eaten yet?" " Sarah and I waited so we could all eat together." "Not yet."  Katherine replied. "We can whip something up." 

"Are you going to take a nap first?" "Yes, it is Minnie's turn tonight, perhaps we will nap together."&nbsp; "Are you sure she is all right Katherine?"&nbsp; "Minnie thinks you are going to banish her to the basement again." Katherine replied. "And have me cut her hair in a pixie."  Mandy added. "What did she do Mandy?"&nbsp; "She lost one of her gold earrings."  Mandy, answered.  "As soon as she discovered it missing, she called each of us on the telephone." "We calmed her down as best we could."&nbsp; "We know you wouldn't do that to her." 

"Minnie believes that she violated your trust Michael, and ours." Katherine added.
"We are a family girls, not a traditional family mind you, but a family never the less." "What she did was impulsive and nothing more." "Do you want me to talk to her?"  Sarah offered.
"Thank you for offering, Sarah but no." "Just play things by ear in regard to dinner." "But first, I will need another kiss and hug from each you to steel my resolve before I enter the library................

I walked into the library and Minnie got up from her chair and immediately assumed the position. "Minnie, you may stand."
"Now come here and give me a hug and a kiss." "I have missed you my dear."  Minnie walked over to me and put her arms around my neck while I put my arms around her waist and pulled her close.

"What do you have to tell me that is so terrible?"  I asked.
"I went into the desk in the library and tried on my gold hoop earring."&nbsp; "I see, you were curious."  I commented. " I was going to wear them while the girls were at work and put them back before Mandy and Katherine got home." &nbsp; "Thank you for your honesty Minnie." "Where are they now?"  I asked.&nbsp; "One of them is in the drawer."  She answered. 

"And the other?"  I asked. "I lost it."  She said in a small voice.
"I'm disappointed with you Minerva." "That was foolish and impulsive." "I'm sorry Michael." "Are you going to punish me?"
"You said you were sorry and I believe you."  I replied.

"But you are going to punish me?" "Yes dear, I am going to punish
you."&nbsp; "Do I have to start all over again, Michael?" "Are you going to cut my hair?" "No.... kiss me Minerva." "You want me to kiss you?"
"Yes, I want you to kiss me, didn't I say I missed my you?" 
'You are scaring me Michael." She said, as she kissed me.
I let go of her and said "Go upstairs and get my belt Minnie, then bring it here." "Yes Michael." She said meekly. 

I made Minnie assume the position and then applied my belt to her shapely buttocks four times, making her wait between cracks. Getting down on the floor next to her, I started stroking her pussy with my fingers. Minnie soon became wet, moaning with pleasure as I stroked her clitoris, wetting her anus with my finger with her own sweet juices.&nbsp; 

I took her there on the floor thrusting my penis into her anus.
"Michael stop, I...."  "Be silent, my dear little bitch!"  I said sharply, as I slapped her sore ass.&nbsp; I continued pounding her asshole with my cock, while&nbsp; stroking and caressing her sopping wet vagina, making her moan and squeal with pleasure. As she climaxed&nbsp; " Fuck me Master...fuck my ass, fuck you your bitch harder...oh...Michael.... make your bitch come...that feels so good...so good...........I'm coming Michael, I want to kiss you!"

After I came, I got up and sat on the couch. "Minnie come here and sit next to me." "I will replace your earrings and you will get them on your birthday."  I said, putting my arm around her and kissing her cheek. "I am going to take a shower and have a nap."

"You should clean up and get dressed." " We shall all have a light meal in the dinning room in about an hour." "Who will I be sleeping with this evening Minnie?"  "It's my turn tonight."  She said putting her head on my shoulder. "In that case, you may join me if you wish." "I have been so busy these past few days, I completely forgot." "You did not, you are teasing me." "You knew perfectly well it was my turn."&nbsp; 

"Is that a smile I see?" "You have such a beautiful smile."  I said, wiping the tears from her face. Taking her hand, we stood and walked upstairs together.&nbsp; And we did exactly that, a shower and a short nap. 

The morning of Minnie's birthday was a very busy one in our home. I made breakfast for all of us, something I do on birthdays for my girls. As it was Minnie's birthday she got to choose the menu; I broiled thick cut pea meal bacon, made western omelets with: eggs, green and red bell peppers, Vidalia onion, sharp cheddar cheese and Virginia ham. I served them bagels with a variety of cream cheeses, to go with their coffee and orange juice.

The girls were going shopping after breakfast to purchase new dresses for Minnie's birthday dinner at Salvatore's. 
They planned on going out to lunch together, followed by a trip to Mandy's Salon for a manicure-pedicure, facial, a full body wax, followed by getting their hair done. I told them I wanted to see lots of curls.

 I have a large private corner booth at Salvatore's paid for in advance for the year, which will comfortably seat eight people; I paid to have it put in.&nbsp; I am a friend of the owner and know all of his regular staff by their first and last names. When I make reservations in advance, Sal will hire an extra server just to wait on our table; Sal and I have an agreement, I will pay the server's wages for the full shift, and include a generous gratuity. Sal also personally prepares each of our dishes, taking exact attention to detail and presentation.

Afterwards, I always will invite Sal and the server to have dessert or after dinner drink with us.&nbsp; We had a wonderful time at dinner, each ordering a different appetizer and entree, plus two others, and we shared, taking a portion of each. We had a bottle of very good house Chianti. We had cannolis and cappuccinos with Sal and Mary our waitress. 

My girls always comport themselves as ladies in public, both in dress and in action. Their manners are impeccable, especially Minnie's.&nbsp; Minerva's public persona outshines them all; she cannot help it, even now it comes to her as easily as breathing. My ladies follow her lead in this venue. I have observed Sarah watching Minerva at dinner; there is no doubt that Sarah will learn and be polished by my marvelous Minerva's example. 

I noticed a marked change in her carriage, specifically her posture and bearing in the way she walked into the restaurant, and while there, how Sarah held and turned her head, observing her hand gestures when ordering dinner and making small talk with Sal and Mary.&nbsp; Yet Sarah was not duplicating Minerva's mannerisms as much as creating her own style, different from Minerva's but in time, no less sophisticated and charming. 

There is no doubt that Minnie was tutoring Sarah in private for the thoughtful gesture of the silk sheets, or to make amends for the way she treated Sarah when she was a Mistress. During the past fourteen months, they have spent a great deal of time together.&nbsp; Looking back, it is fascinating watching them interacting, both here and at home.

 

As we were leaving Salvatore's, Sal's nephew, Vito and part time bartender asked to have a word with me in private.&nbsp; Vito is also a full time Sheriff' Deputy with the rank of sergeant.
"Michael, I would like to have a word with you if you don't mind."
"We can go into my uncle's office if that is all right with you?"
&nbsp; 
I followed him in and closed the door. Vito spoke first "Your ex-wife was here last night." "So, what does that have to do with me." "I have washed my hands of her."  Vito knew of my acrimonious divorce. 

He was the Deputy that served the orders of protection, removing me from my home; he also testified on my behalf during the divorce proceedings. "I know you hate her Michael, but you need to hear me out." "I'm sorry I was curt with you Vito, you caught me by surprise is all." "I have not heard from Martha in seven years."&nbsp; "I have forgiven her in my own way." "What did she say?"  I asked.  "It was not so much what she said, but how she looked and acted." 

"At first, I didn't recognize her, she is much thinner now and a blond."&nbsp; Martha was wearing dark oversize sunglass like celebrities wear, but I suspect, to hide one or more black eyes, and heavy make up, in the attempt to hide bruises.&nbsp; She was acting nervous, and a little bit scared." 

"I offered to help her." "She said that it wouldn't do any good, he always got out." "If she had him arrested again, this time he would kill her!" "She said that she wanted to talk to you before it was to late." "Then she left."&nbsp; I thanked him and shook hands, before leaving with my Ladies to go dancing.

The next day all hell broke loose. My Ladies and I were in the kitchen eating lunch. Katherine and Mandy had taken a month off from work, and we were planning our vacation in Hawaii, when the front door doorbell started ringing, frantically, and then pounding started as well. 
I got up to answer the door, the girls following behind.
We had just entered the foyer, when I heard a crash, the distinctive sound of glass breaking and metal coming together, followed by a woman's terrified scream.

Martha was leaning on the door facing the wreckage. Her present husband, the shining knight she met on the internet had rear-ended 
Her 1965 Corvette Convertible, demolishing it, preventing her escape.

I yanked opened the door and Martha stumbled backwards into my arms. Turning to face me "Mickey I..." Martha fainted.

A large man emerged from the ramming vehicle, a mint, well it used to be mint, late model Lincoln Continental of 1970's vintage. I have to grudgingly admit they have fine tastes in automobiles.

Martha's husband was about six feet tall, easily 260 lbs. I would guess his age, early thirties. As he climbed out the car, I could hear him shouting," You no good cheating whore!" "I have finally caught you, you slut."  He advanced slowly, smiling, removing a butterfly knife from his suit coat pocket, flicking his wrist and locking the blade in place.&nbsp; "Girls, take her inside and close the door, then call the police".&nbsp; "But...." Minnie started to say as I closed the door.
 
He stopped six feet from me, sneering.  "I own that slattern." "Give me my cheating cunt of a wife and I will leave." "Otherwise I will just take her, but not until I cut your balls off." "Get off my property, I don't care if you have to walk." I replied.  "Fuck you!" He screamed. "That won't be necessary." &nbsp; I retorted, calmly. "Just give me a blowjob and we will call it even."


He charged me slashing clumsily, extending his arm much to far, something an experienced knife fighter would never do. I jumped back easily avoiding his clumsy attempt wishing I had my taser, and tripping him in the process.

He got to his feet cursing, changing his tactics, he reversed the knife in his hand, grasping it like an ice pick, slowly advancing, with the knife over his head hoping to pin me against the door with his bulk and stab me at his leisure.

Refusing to retreat, I caught his wrist as the knife came down. We both struggled, attempting to knee on another in the groin. He trying was trying to kill me.&nbsp; I was trying to keep from being stabbed. 

Our struggles brought us out to the driveway. He was much stronger then I anticipated and out weighed me by a good sixty
pounds. However, he was out of shape and starting to get winded from the exertions.&nbsp; Desperate, he smashed his head into my nose, stunning me. As I went down, I let go of wrist but managed to kick his knee, hearing the satisfying pop and crunch of torn ligaments.

My adversary screamed like a banshee, but somehow managed to stay on his feet cursing and threatening, "I'm going to kill you and everybody in your family."  As he limped towards me, waving the knife wildly in front of him.

 I was scrambled to get on my feet, holding my broken nose and trying to staunch the flow of blood pouring out; I was dizzy; my head spinning. Suddenly, our front door opened and my girls came running out; Minnie, Sarah, Mandy and last but not least, Katherine; each with a makeshift weapon in their hand, a cast iron frying pan.

Minerva arrived first and shouted&nbsp; "Hey, Frank!"
Frank stopped advancing, a shocked look on his face, slowly
turned and looked at Minnie.&nbsp; "Minerva?"  Obviously they knew
each other. "Say goodbye, Frank!"  As she swung the cast iron skillet for all she was worth, hitting him square in the face and rendering him unconscious. 

Minnie then dropped the frying pan and rushed over to see if I was all right, as did all my beautiful and brave girls. I didn't have enough arms to hug them, or enough words to praise and thank them.&nbsp; Martha, my ex-wife was on her hands and knees in the doorway crying and shaking, unable to move. Martha was so terrified that she defecated, soiling her clothing and had thrown up on the floor. I could kill this scum for what he did to her and what he would have done if we had not stopped him.

I sent Mandy to get my taser and handcuffs to secure Frank until
the police arrived; Katherine went back into the house to get her medical bag; Minnie and Sarah kept fussing over me, trying to get me to sit down as I may have a concussion. 

We cuffed him and then rolled him onto a blanket, using it as a makeshift stretcher to carry the offal into the house.
After Katherine took care of my broken nose, packing it with gauze and giving me an ice pack for my face, to help stop the swelling. I refused aspirin for the pain, refusing anything stronger,
needing a clear head.

Next, she attended to the offal, awake now and sniveling about his broken nose and shattered dentures: top and bottom as well as his damaged leg. I spit on the floor near him in disgust.
Katherine first immobilized his leg with an air splint, packed his nose and gave him oxyecodone for his pain.

While this was going on, Mandy and Sarah took Martha upstairs to get her cleaned up, calmed down and given a pair of pajamas to wear. Martha allowed herself to be brought upstairs and the girls fussed over her, helping her shower, washing the heavy makeup from her face, then shampooing the vomit from her long bleached blond hair.


When Martha was cleaned up and in her pajamas, Katherine gave her an injection, a sedative to help her sleep and then put her to bed; Mandy and Sarah sat with her talking quietly, reassuring and comforting her until she fell into a deep, much needed asleep.

The offal scum was now pleading for me to let him go, claiming that it was all a misunderstanding. That not working offered to buy me off, claiming he would disappear, leave the country and never bother Martha again.&nbsp; I just stared at him not speaking, until he eventually gave up.

Arthur telephoned to say that he would arrive with the enforcers in three hours and would land his helicopter in the open field next to my house; I gave him a brief summary of what transpired.&nbsp; Prior to his telephone call, two wreakers arrived to remove and secure the damaged vehicles from the driveway.

Arthur greeted the girls warmly in the foyer, when he arrived, receiving a hug and kiss on the cheek, then giving them a hug and kiss in return, while congratulating them on their cool heads and bravery.

With the greetings and pleasantries out of the way, he dismissed the girls, all except for Minerva, then turned to face the offal scum sitting on the floor of my foyer, all expression now gone from his face.&nbsp; Walking past him, he opened the door the let the three enforcers enter. As is the way of the Sanctorum, they were masked and silent, wearing long red hooded robes over their street clothing. Arthur pointed to the wretch on the floor: Two of the enforcers each grabbed his cuffed arms forcing the scum to stand.&nbsp; 

Arthur walked up to the now blubbering offal and removed the
carnation from his lapel and placing it into the lapel of the prisoner; the miserable poltroon wetting himself.
Arthur turned his back, as did Minerva and I; the enforcers left with the condemned, closing the door behind them..........................

As we were leaving Salvatore's, Sal's nephew, Vito and part time bartender asked to have a word with me in private.&nbsp; Vito is also a full time Sheriff' Deputy with the rank of sergeant.
"Michael, I would like to have a word with you if you don't mind."
"We can go into my uncle's office if that is all right with you?"
&nbsp; 
I followed him in and closed the door. Vito spoke first "Your ex-wife was here last night." "So, what does that have to do with me." "I have washed my hands of her."  Vito knew of my acrimonious divorce.

"I have not heard from Martha in seven years."&nbsp; "I have forgiven her in my own way." "What did she say?"  I asked.  "It was not so much what she said, but how she looked and acted."

"I offered to help her." "She said that it wouldn't do any good, he always got out." "If she tried to him arrested, this time he would kill her!" "She said that she wanted to talk to you before it was to late." "Then she left."&nbsp; I thanked him and shook hands.

The next day all hell broke loose. My Ladies and I were in the kitchen eating lunch. Katherine and Mandy had taken a month off from work, and we were planning our vacation in Hawaii; I was planning on renting a small yacht, when the front door doorbell started ringing, frantically, and then pounding started as well. 

I got up to answer the door with the girls following close behind.
We had just entered the foyer, when I heard a crash, the distinctive sound of glass breaking and metal coming together, followed by a woman's terrified scream.

Our struggles brought us out to the driveway. He was much stronger then I anticipated and out weighed me by a good sixty
pounds. However, he was out of shape and was starting to get winded from the exertions.&nbsp; Desperate, he smashed his head into my nose, stunning me. As I went down, I let go of wrist but managed to kick his knee, hearing the satisfying pop and crunch of torn ligaments.

My adversary screamed like a banshee, but somehow managed to stay on his feet cursing and threatening, "I'm going to kill you and everybody in your family." " As he limped towards me, waving the knife wildly in front of him, spittle spraying as he screamed.

 I scrambled to get on my feet, holding my broken nose and trying to staunch the flow of blood pouring out. Suddenly, our front door opened and my girls came running out; Minnie, Sarah, Mandy and last but not least, Katherine; each with a makeshift weapon in their hand, a cast iron frying pan.

Minerva arrived first and shouted&nbsp; "Hey, Frank!"
Frank stopped advancing, a shocked look on his face, slowly
turned and looked at Minnie.&nbsp; "Minerva?"  Obviously they knew
each other. "Say goodbye, Frank!"  As she swung the cast iron skillet for all she was worth, hitting him square in the face, knocking him off his feet and rendering him unconscious. 

Minnie then dropped the frying pan and rushed over to see how bad I was hurt, as did all my beautiful and brave girls At that moment, I didn't have enough arms to hug them, or enough words to praise and thank them.&nbsp; Martha, my ex-wife was on her hands and knees in the doorway crying and shaking, unable to move. Martha was so terrified that she defecated, soiling her clothing and had thrown up on the floor. I could kill this scum for what he did to her and what he would have done if we had not stopped him.

I sent Mandy to get my taser and handcuffs in order secure Frank until the Sanctorum sent the enforcers; Minerva had taken the imitative and telephoned Arthur on my satellite phone, knowing Frank's history and sanctions; I shut the door before she could tell me. Katherine went back into the house to get her medical bag; Minnie and Sarah kept fussing over me, trying to get me to lie down as I may have a concussion. 

We cuffed him and then rolled him onto a blanket, using it as a makeshift stretcher to carry the offal into the house.
Once inside, Katherine took care of my broken nose, packing it with gauze and giving me an ice pack for my face to help stop the swelling. I refused anything stronger then aspirin for the pain, needing to keep a clear head.

Next, she attended to the offal, awake now and sniveling about his broken nose and shattered dentures: top and bottom as well as his damaged leg. I spit on the floor near him in disgust.
Katherine first immobilized his leg with an air splint, packed his nose and gave him oxyecodone for his pain.

While this was going on, Mandy and Sarah took Martha upstairs to get her cleaned up, calmed down and given a pair of pajamas to wear. Martha allowed herself to be brought upstairs and the girls fussed over her, helping her shower, washing the heavy makeup from her face, then shampooing the vomit from her long bleached blond hair.


When Martha was cleaned up and in her pajamas, Katherine gave her an injection, a sedative to help her sleep and then put her to bed; Mandy and Sarah sat with her talking quietly, reassuring and comforting her until she fell into a deep, much needed asleep.

The offal scum was now pleading for me to let him go, claiming that it was all a misunderstanding. That not working offered to buy me off, claiming he would disappear, leave the country and never bother Martha again.&nbsp; I just stared at him not speaking, until he eventually gave up.

Arthur telephoned to say that he would arrive with the enforcers in three hours and would land his helicopter in the open field next to my house; I gave him a brief summary of what transpired.&nbsp; Prior to his telephone call, two wreakers arrived to remove and secure the damaged vehicles from the driveway.

When he arrived, Arthur greeted the girls warmly in the foyer; Sarah, Mandy and Katherine, receiving a hug and kiss on the cheek, then giving them a hug and kiss in return, while congratulating them on their cool heads and bravery; Minnie just stood there looking; Arthur had presided at her Tribunal.
Arthur walked up to Minerva kissing her cheek for the first time, saying "You may give a hug and kiss my dear, you have made me very proud of you this day."  Minnie reached up touched her cheek where Arthur had kissed her. I could she her bottom lip quiver and her eyes starting to tear; Minerva kissed and hugged Arthur grateful for his approval, and Arthur hugged her as would a father,
a daughter and whispered something in her ear.


With the greetings and pleasantries out of the way, he dismissed the girls, all except for Minerva, then turned to face the offal scum sitting on the floor of my foyer, all expression now gone from his face, his merry blue eyes now cold and hard.&nbsp; Walking past him, he opened the door the let the three enforcers enter. As is the way of the Sanctorum, they were masked and silent, wearing long red hooded robes over their street clothing. 

Arthur pointed to the wretch on the floor: Two of the enforcers grabbed his cuffed arms forcing the scum to stand.&nbsp; Arthur walked up to the now blubbering offal and removed the
carnation from his lapel and placing it into the lapel of the prisoner; the miserable poltroon wetting himself.
Arthur turned his back, as did Minerva and I; the enforcers left with the condemned, closing the door behind them..........................

The girls went to prepare lunch and Arthur and I retired to the library. I poured Arthur and I a large snifter cognac and I was debriefed.&nbsp; "What are you going to do about your ex-wife?"
" I don't know yet Arthur, my head is killing me." "I'm hoping the 
Brandy will help."  I answered.&nbsp; "Katherine treated her for shock and can attest to her physical condition." "Mandy and Sarah helped her shower and get dressed." "I suppose she could stay here for now." "I certainly have the room."

No sooner then I said this, Minnie knocked on the door announcing lunch was ready. 

We had lunch in the dinning room together, discussing what had just happened and the ramifications. The girls informed us that Martha was covered with bruises, most of the starting to fade.
In addition to this, there were scars on her back what appeared to be from cigarettes or cigars; Minnie remembered that Frank was a smoker.

 Katherine confirmed the cause of the scars. In addition,
there were fresh bruises on her torso adjacent to Martha's kidneys and she would not be surprised if Martha was passing blood, "I will bet my hoops, that x-rays will show healed over broken bones to go along with her cracked ribs on her left side." We all sat there for a while, not talking, contemplating this additional information.
Sarah was the first to speak 

 "Was or is Martha a slave Arthur?
"No dear, why would you ask such a question? "Because when I was helping her wash, I noticed part of a tattoo, under her breast that said property of"........................ At this comment, Arthur stood up abruptly, but then sat down. 

"No Sarah, Franklin Abrug was sanctioned by the Sanctorum never to own slaves again." "In addition, all of his wealth was seized, under the condition that we spare his life.
"Martha has never been registered with the Sanctorum." 
"Franklin Abzub is a sick internet predator and will be dealt with
swiftly.  

After lunch, Arthur and I again retired to the library. Closing the doors and turning to me, Arthur suggested." May I make a suggestion Michael?" "Absolutely Arthur you know I value your advise." Take your vacation with your ladies." "I will have Martha placed in a secure private hospital until you return." "This matter requires further investigation." "I will see to it that Martha receives the best of care in addition to a complete forensic physical." "In, addition we will conduct a full background check 
on her from birth to the present." "The Sanctorum is responsible, I am responsible for her present deplorable situation."

"When you return, you will be given copies of our findings."
"At that point, I am sure you will see to her rehabilitation and care, until she can make a decision to what path she will take.
"You were married to her once, and I believe in your own way that you still care for Martha"..............................................


















 

























 
















 






































 



















































I
















 








































Approximately 5 months have passed since we returned from our vacation in Hawaii. 
I was getting regular reports from the private clinic/hospital on Martha's progress. 
I am confident that she is receiving the best of care. 

The tattoos were removed, as were the scars from the burns and whippings, or at least they were minimized to be barely noticeable.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
While they were married, that sick bastard Frank Abzug broke Martha's nose.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Her nose has been reshaped by the best plastic surgeons.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Her deviated septum was also corrected and Martha no longer has to breathe through her mouth. 
Arthur tells me that he is amazed at the results&nbsp; 

The scum even pulled some of her teeth out... we assume that he did because Martha always had perfect teeth.&nbsp; 
We also suspect this because the teeth around the extracted ones were chipped and damaged.&nbsp; 
Martha's teeth were cleaned, repaired and/or reconstructed to make the most vain Hollywood Diva jealous with envy. 

Lastly, Martha was given laser surgery to correct her naturally deteriorating eyesight; her eyesight is now 20/30.&nbsp; 

Martha's emotional scars are another matter entirely and she is presently receiving counseling.
Arthur hinted about another treatment that it is experimental and cutting edge having to do with biorhythms and subliminal suggestions and such.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

This was quite successful with former Grand Mistress Maud, and necessary because of her intimate knowledge of the Sanctorum and its finances. 

Arthur has also made all of the legal arrangements pertaining to Martha, and with everything Arthur does they were rock solid and insoluble.&nbsp; 

I have Power of Attorney over her affairs and she is now my legal ward. 
Martha will be released in my care in approximately three months.

Although she is not my slave, Martha has no real say in anything. 
I really haven't sorted out my feeling about her yet.... except that I never wanted anything bad to happen to her despite our very acrimonious divorce.&nbsp; 
There is a lingering feeling left from her betrayal ... I must learn put this aside.&nbsp; 

At one Saturday meeting, I explained to my girls that in my book Martha would be starting with a clean page. 
"Martha's abuse at the hands of that monster, Abzug was punishment enough, ladies. 
Martha will be staying here on temporary basics until we decide if she is suited to our lifestyle." 

"What do you mean by we, Michael?" 
Mandy asked. 

"We are a family my dear ladies." I said standing up and smiling at her.&nbsp; 
I then walked over to each of my girls, kissing them lightly on the mouth and gently touching their faces, feeling very content and happy. 

I was thinking; "Yes, life is definitely good." 

"As I have said many time before, we are a non-conventional family, but a family, nevertheless.&nbsp; 
I want input from each of you because you will be living with and working with her.
She may not be compatible for our household or our lifestyle, in which case I will find other living quarters for Martha. 
Perhaps I will build a small log cabin in the woods behind our house or set her up in an apartment in town.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
If I decide on the log cabin, it will be a modern one with electricity and other amenities not the primitive kind." 

All of my girls consider and refer to my house, (my name is on the title) as our house or their home.&nbsp; 
They take great pride in seeing that our home is neat, clean and absolutely spotless, especially Sarah and Minerva, they being my house slaves. 

Our kitchen and our bathrooms are a standard of clean to which many hospitals can only hope to emulate. 
Therefore, I allow Sarah and Minerva great latitude in how the house is decorated. 
For example: the color schemes/decor for paint and fabrics, for choosing the oriental rugs, bedding, drapes, bath towels and sheets, or curtains etc., things of that nature. 

Our home is bright and airy, full of plants, and always.... always, fresh cut flowers in every room which pleases them greatly. 
It is also free of clutter, especially the unnecessary knickknacks and common commercial collectables gathering dust that my ex-wife
was so fond displaying, and hardly ever dusted, that I always loathed and barley tolerated. 

My library is off limits for their decor venue, (except that I let Minerva choose the oriental carpets) nonetheless they keep it vacuumed, dusted, plus all the paneling and woodwork is meticulously waxed and polished.&nbsp; 

"A real log cabin!" 
Sarah exclaimed. 
"That will be so intimate and so cozy. 
We could use it as a guesthouse if things do work out with Martha. 
The cabin will be our get away to be alone with you, one at a time of course.&nbsp; 
Yes, that would be so intimate and cozy."
Sarah repeated, crossing her arms and hugging herself. 

"You should consider a hot tub, Michael. 
A hot tub with pulsing water jets would be very therapeutic, especially one deep enough to come up to our necks." 
Katherine offered.&nbsp; 
 
"You will put in a fireplace, won't you, Michael?" 
Sarah asked, delighted with the prospect of a log cabin.

"Yes, a fireplace, what a wonderful idea, Sarah, and Katherine's hot tub idea is great too!" 
Mandy exclaimed. 

"A field stone fireplace and a granite hot tub.
Anything else, ladies?"
I asked.
 
I noticed that Minerva was unusually quiet and thoughtful.
I would speak to her when we were alone, as her experience as a Mistress could prove to be valuable.

"I will consider all of your suggestions, ladies, and we will speak of it further. 
In the mean time, I suggest that we get dressed so that we may all go out and have brunch together.
Then we will be going for a drive in the country to get apples and fresh apple cider.... we will make it a day and enjoy the fall colors."

They dressed casually, each wearing form hugging blue jeans and white Nike walking shoes with pink accents and pink laces. 
They all were wearing pale green voile cotton peasant blouses with satiny dark green embroidery on the front, on the sleeves and around the neck.&nbsp; 
The blouse's smocked neckline had a dark green tasseled tie at the center front with matching trailing tassel ties on the three-quarter sleeves; the hem was unadorned. 

If later in the day the weather turned cooler, they each had a pink front zip hooded sweatshirt.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I allowed them matching black beaded purses with a narrow shoulder strap. 
The purses were just large enough for their makeup, basic Identification and spending money. 
The only makeup they were allowed today was eyeliner, mascara and lip-gloss... and of course their signature scents.

As I often do, I chose their hairstyles for the day, starting with Sarah. 
Sarah's well cared for hair is thick and soft, like a dark brown waterfall, cascading over her shoulders and now flowing to the middle of her back and well on its way to being waist length again. 
Her beautiful hair is blunt cut without layers, and she still has the same eye framing bangs.
Today her hair will be parted in the middle and fixed in twin French braids with the ends tied with pink ribbons. 
If I decide on a late supper in a restaurant this evening, she will put her hair up in a bun. 

And then there is my delectable peach, Mandy, so small and petite, barely 100 lbs. soaking wet.
Her rich, honey-blond hair is now almost 4 inches past her shoulders and blunt cut, as is all my girl's hair.
Mandy's will be side parted and fixed in thick and soft twin ponytails, just above and behind her ears and tied with the same pink ribbons.

My voluptuous Katherine, whom I still can't best at chess and still delight playing chess with and losing. 
For her I have chosen a simple three-strand braid for her light brown hair.
Her light brown hair now is just short of touching her shoulder blades.
And of course her hair will be tied with pink ribbons. 
She too, along with Mandy and Sarah, will be mandated to fix their hair in a bun for a possible late supper.&nbsp; 

Minerva will not be wearing her red auburn hair in a braid or a bun for it is not quite long enough for a proper one as yet. 
It has grown out nicely from that ultra-short layered pixie cut that I had once imposed on her. 
Her hair is just past the nape of her neck, being a perfect long bob that is blunt cut without bangs.

Mandy fixed Minerva's hair in luscious ringlet curls, and then pulled the curls in front away from Minerva's face. 
She gathered the front sections into two small curly ponytails and then tied the ponytails with pink ribbons leaving the bulk of the luscious curls loose for my fingers to fondle.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

My girls made their entrances while I was outside hitching our utility trailer to the 3/4-ton Dodge Conversion Van that Mandy normally drives.
Minerva was first, walking up behind me and putting her hands over my eyes.&nbsp; 
I was crouched down securing the safety chains to the hitch and I was pretending not to see her. 

"Guess who, Michael?"
She teased. 

"Katherine, I know it is you, you can't fool me."
I answered, standing up and not turning around. 

"Wrong answer!"
Minerva exclaimed, mussing my hair, playfully. 

I grabbed her wrist and quickly turned to face her. 
I then pulled her close, shifting my hands to the back of her trim waist.
"I'm sorry Shirley Temple, I mistook you for someone else."

"Shirley Temple was a blond, Michael."
Minerva said, turning her head so that I couldn't kiss her mouth, and then putting her hands on my chest and pretending to push me away. 

"That can be arranged. 
I will talk to Mandy about it, although I am thinking platinum blond, and your hair will be cut shorter.&nbsp; 
You will be given regular permanents to maintain that look." 
I kissed her mouth, enjoying her generous lips. 

"You wouldn't dare....&nbsp; I take it back, and stop tickling me." 
She said, laughing and squirming, this time really trying to get away.
"I give up, Master, I give up, you are just liable to do it!" 
I stopped tickling and kissed her mouth, moving one hand to her head and running my fingers through her red curls.

"You look beautiful my love, my marvelous curly redhead.&nbsp; 
Is there something that you want to talk to me about?"

"I want to talk to you about Martha as soon as we are alone together."
 
"I thought as much, you were quiet this morning and I want to talk to you as well.
Switch with Sarah and sleep with me tonight and we will talk and cuddle.
She can have your turn tomorrow night." 

I kissed her again and then helped her into the van waiting for my other ladies.

Next was my pretty girl, Sarah, whom simply put her arms around my neck and kissed me passionately.
I put my arms around her waist and returned her kisses, enjoying her sweet lips and vanilla scent.
"Do you like my hair, Michael?"

"I love your hair and everything about you, my little lady. 
I would ask you a favor; I want you to switch with Minerva.
I promise you and we will do something special for your thoughtfulness." 

"What are we going to do, Michael?"
She asked, kissing me again just as passionately.

"I not sure yet, but I'll think of something, and it may be when you least expect it." 
I answered, tugging her long braids and then helping her into the van.

Katherine and Mandy came out together, as they often do, and looking as lovely as always.
They tend to pair off naturally, much like Sarah and Minerva do now. 
Mandy was carrying an insulated cooler full of frozen bottled water.

Katherine was carrying a medium sized square duffle containing an extensive field first-aid medical kit. 
She is currently a Physician's Assistant, and an excellent one at that.
I'm considering sending her to medical school to become a full pledged doctor.

Although a slave, Katherine has a brilliant, analytical mind and has a gift for medicine. 
I am more then willing to open and fund a clinic for her.
Katherine's bedside manner and compassion for Martha was very impressive. 
She even treated that offal scum, Frank Abzug, efficiently and professionally, although in his case, coldly and dispassionately. 

I received my hugs and kisses from Mandy and Katherine, after complimenting them on how nice that they looked.
Then I helped them into the van and we were soon on our way.&nbsp; 

We had a pleasant brunch planning the log cabin and then a wonderful afternoon picking apples and kissing under the trees.&nbsp; 
We went to 3 different farm orchards and picked 9 bushels total: Empires, Honeycrisps, Braeburns, Cortlands and McIntosh, plus Idareds, Crispins, Jonagolds and Fuji apples. 

We stopped at a large outdoor farmers market for fresh garlic, bushels of eggplant, tomatoes, hot &amp; sweet peppers and/or any other fresh produce that struck our fancy.&nbsp; 
Sarah and Minerva would be freezing and canning starting Monday.&nbsp; 

At one point in the afternoon, Sarah and I were alone walking side-by-side, browsing, after just purchasing dried lavender to put in our linen closets and dresser drawers.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I had my arms around her waist and Sarah was eating an Italian Ice. 
The other girls were back at the van getting ready for dinner at the Black North Inn. 
The Inn is located at the end of Route 98 North at the mouth of the Oak Orchard River where the river empties into Lake Ontario. 

While we were browsing, we came across the booth of the young married couple that owned and operated the floral shop where I purchase my flowers.
Toby &amp; Mary McAllister are good, solid people who have worked hard to make their business a success and I admire them for that.&nbsp; 
They both put in long hours and Toby does this large Farmer's Market in the late summer and early fall while Mary stays in the shop.

Toby's ride was parked behind his booth, a full dressed, black, 1999 Honda GL 1500 SE Gold Wing Touring Bike. 
This gave me an idea. 
Even though I have not ridden in years, I still have my motorcycle license. 

I walked up and shook Toby's hand in greeting and Sarah politely greeted him as well. 
She then stood next to me holding my arm and patiently waited while I talked with him. 

"Toby, how would you like to make one thousand dollars this weekend for just sitting home on Sunday?"
I asked, laying ten one hundred dollar bills on the table between us.

"That would be wonderful, what do you have in mind?"
He answered, but not picking up the bills, his interest obvious from the momentary surprised look on his face, but caution prevailed 
and he waited to hear my proposal before he accepted the money.&nbsp; 

"I want to rent your scoot for the rest of the weekend. 
I will pay to have it fully serviced and detailed at the Honda dealer when I am done.
I doubt that I will put more then 150 miles on it, but if I do I will pay you ten dollars a mile for very mile over 150." 

We consummated our agreement with a handshake. 
Sarah tried on his wife's leather jacket that was stored in the one of the saddlebags.
I suspected that it would fit since Mary was slightly larger then Sarah and Mary's helmet fit my pretty girl as well.

As for myself, I left the house in blue jeans, a, long sleeved white silk shirt (a gift from my ladies) and a well-worn and comfortable dark brown goatskin A-2 Bomber jacket. 

I also had on my scuffed but polished, and very comfortable black steel toe engineer boots.&nbsp; 
I wear them for safety reasons when cutting and splitting wood.&nbsp; 
Mark's helmet fit me perfectly, so that base was covered as well, perfect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Sarah was a little nervous when she first got on the bike behind me.&nbsp; 
I drove slowly behind the various vender booths until I got to the van. 
Mandy and Katherine had their hair pinned up in pretty buns and were looking forward to going out to dinner. 
My girls surrounded Sarah and I wanting to know where I got the ride, all of them talking at once. 

I promised Minerva a ride home and Mandy would get her chance tomorrow. 
Katherine declined my offer saying that she had no use for motorcycles, which brought on some good-natured teasing. 
I was not about to force her.&nbsp; 
I had... shall we say, two other potential biker chicks waiting to ride with me? 

I told the girls to bring our purchases home, unhitch the trailer and then meet us for dinner in two hours.
I took Sarah's hair out of her braids, letting her long brown hair spill down to the middle of her back on the borrowed leather jacket. 
I tied the two pink ribbons together and put them in my jacket pocket. 

In order to get the feel of the bike, I started out at slow to moderate speeds.&nbsp; 
This was a serious machine, with a four stroke, 6-cylinder boxer/1520 ccm. (92.75 cubic inch) displacement and a 5 speed
gearbox. 
With a top speed of 118 mph (180.0 km/h), if you will pardon the expression, this bitch could hall ass. 

I rode a beat-up moped while in college, until I sold my first patent to IBM. 
They wanted to keep my motherboard out of the market for the next ten years or until the competition came up with one similar. 
This gave me my seed money to incorporate and start my own business with just one employee... me. 

In celebration, I purchased a trashed 1965 Harley panhead and completely restored it to almost showroom condition, except for adding a suicide throttle.

I rode with a very rough crowd in those days, drinking and getting into fights, sometimes just for the sake of fighting.
Not that I was a hardcore biker, but I liked the unfettered freedom that it afforded me, and the women. 
In the beginning, many of the fights were because word got out that I was somewhat of an intellectual, and heaven forbid, liked poetry.

There is a price to pay for everything, I won some and lost some, and have the scars to prove it. 

I never looked for trouble; however, I never backed down when trouble found me. 
I was grudgingly tolerated, and mostly was left alone, but never really accepted, however I was allowed at all open meets. 
Actually, I was somewhat of a novelty to them.&nbsp; 

I charmed many of the biker chicks over with poetry or Shakespeare: Romeo &amp; Juliet was a favorite.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
It was said that "Shakespeare" (me) was OK to party with because he minded his own business and kept his mouth shut and was a pretty good crank (mechanic) with a wrench... and he just might bash you with it. 

That was my nickname, my handle in those wild days. 
I sold my panhead to Snake, during the third year of my marriage, my interests were changing and I did not want Martha or my child exposed to this crude and rough lifestyle.&nbsp; 
This was the year that Martha was carrying my son. 

Snake was the closest thing to a friend that I had with the bikers, and he was one scary son of a bitch.
The man could look at you with his cold expressionless eyes, snake eyes, and back most men down with his frigid stare alone. 
I took his back in a fast food restaurant parking late one night against 6 drunken jocks, football players looking for trouble.

At that time, I knew of him, but never met him.

As I said, Snake was a loner and one crazy son of a bitch; even the bikers were afraid of him, and for those people that was saying something. 

He was down on the ground and they were stomping the hell out of him, although he did manage to bite a pretty big chuck out of one jocks legs while down there. 
I set one of the jock's cars on fire as a distraction and managed to knock one of them out, and rupture another's testicles, giving Snake a chance to get on his feet to fight. 

In all the confusion, I grabbed Snake and got him the hell out of there before the police and firemen arrived. 
The fight was mostly out of the jocks by now; all we got was mouth from them at that juncture, but not Snake, who could barely stand. 
They made no attempt to stop us or follow us, at least not on foot... and the car was engulfed in flames by then.... but I digress, back to my pretty girl.

Sarah was glued to my back with her arms around my waist and holding on tight.
She was also urging me to go faster and was laughing with delight along with the music from the pipes.
When I hit a 3-mile straightaway, I opened the throttle all the way. 
The vibration of that powerful engine between my legs, coupled with a beautiful woman behind me.... a beautiful and loving woman with her long hair streaming behind her in the rushing wind, gave me a rock hard erection. 

I had plans for us and intended to make a detour and stop at the Hamlin Beach State Park to get into my pretty girl's pants.
Her initial fear was now over and Sarah was exhilarated with this new experience. 

Sarah was getting turned on by the speed and was trying to put her hand down into the front of my jeans. 
If only this horse was equipped with a suicide throttle. 
No doubt, for Sarah the bike was a 100 horsepower vibrator at 5200 RPM, stimulating her sweet clitoris.

When we arrived at Hamlin I paid the entrance fee, declining the complimentary map, as I knew all the parks along the lake like the back of my hand.

We drove around a bit checking things out; Sarah has been here often with me, particularly before I acquired my three other ladies.
Aside from a few late season fishermen, and a smattering of campers, we pretty much had the place to ourselves.
I went to a secluded stones pavilion in an isolated corner and drove the bike inside parking on the concrete floor. 
Before I could get my helmet off, Sarah had already taken off hers and was all over me. 

Sarah was kissing my mouth hungrily, her little tongue seeking mine.
I could smell the musky sweetness of her arousal before I reached down to touch her crotch through her snug, damp blue jeans.
I took Sarah's head in my hands, burying my hands in her long soft hair, and returned her kisses, while enjoying her sweet mouth and welcoming her little tongue with mine. 

"Please, Michael."
She begged, while rubbing my face with her hand. 
"I am so horny. 
I want you to make love to me right on the bike."

I took off my blue jeans and got on, while telling her to remove hers. 
Sarah's panties were wet from her sweet juices and before she could get them off, I took her panties in both hands, and ripped them from her making her gasp in surprise and then smile. 

I reached up underneath her blouse and unhooked her bra so that I could get at her marvelous, firm, round breasts. 
Sarah's nipples were already hard and I cupped her breasts, squeezing. 
I stroked her hard nipples with my thumbs, making her moan with pleasure. 
Sarah has such wonderfully sensitive nipples.

I stroked her dripping vagina, feeling her wet swollen pussy, sending a shiver through her body. 
I then pulled up her blouse to lick and suck on her proud hard nipples, while continuing to stroke her musky fragrant flower.

Sarah's head was tilted back, her eyes were closed, and I watched tip of her little tongue tease her lips and teeth, waiting for my cock to arrive. 
I kissed the base of her throat, while caressing her breasts... teasing... and then I kissed her face and behind her ears, her vanilla scent mingling with the rich musky woman's scent of her arousal. 

I got back up on the seat and had my little princess straddle the gas tank in a sitting position facing me with her feet on the pegs.
I picked her up and placed her on my rock hard manhood with my hands under her ass cheeks.

Sarah's arms were around my neck while she was impaling her sweet cunt, up and down, up and down on my manhood, pushing her feet against the rear pegs for leverage, as I was using the front ones for the same, matching her rhythm, and supporting her bottom to keep her from sliding off.

I was watching my sweet chattel, her head thrown back in ecstasy and exposing her long vulnerable neck for me to kiss.
Sarah's long hair was bouncing and swaying with our movements on the smooth surface of her leather jacket. 
Her eyes were clenched tight, and her little tongue was darting in and out between her teeth and lips.
She was moaning, softly and wanting to scream, so shamelessly and selflessly intent on pleasing herself. 

This is something I find so endearing when making love to her.&nbsp; 
As a person, and by nature, Sarah is sweet and generous, modest and kind. 
My love for her is equal too my love for Minerva. 
My Marvelous Minerva, whom I have known and loved the longest and was to pig-headed to tell her when she was a Mistress.

I love Mandy and Katherine in different ways, but not with the same depth of passion that I feel for Sarah and Minerva.
In the Sanctorum, a man is free to pursue his instinctual drives, in regard to sex and women. 
I can't put it into words.... I just know how I feel... 

"Oh Master." 
She moaned, softly. 
"My god it feels so good.....mmmm....suck on my nipples, Michael....yessss........ I love you so much. 

Sarah came in waves, her orgasm washing over me as it crested.&nbsp; 
I had to cover her mouth with my hand to muffle her screams of pleasure. 
She was bucking and squirming in shear orgasmic desperation. 

I grabbed hold of her long hair, still holding her bottom with one hand as she rode me to keep her from falling off the bike. 
This intensified her wild orgasmic pleasure even more; so oblivious to everything was she except her throbbing clitoris. 
The pulling of her hair was arousing her even more if possible, and making her muffled orgasmic screams louder. 

After she came, Sarah collapsed in my arms, red in the face and embarrassed at screaming like that in public. 
I held her and stroked her hair, curling my finger around one long tress. 

"You are such a horny little thing, my pretty girl.
Thank you for switching with Minerva."&nbsp; 

"Do you love me, Michael?"
She asked, touching my face... this was the first time that Sarah had ever asked me this. 
"I know you love Minerva, we talk about you.... Minerva says that you do. 
She also told me that you love me as much as her, perhaps more, and that she was jealous of me once." 

"I love her like a sister, Michael, and sometimes we know what each other are thinking. 
I have three older brothers whom believe that women and children should be seen and not heard." (It should be noted that Sarah's
parents are both deceased, an important reason why I chose her)

"You are the first man who ever really talked to me and cared about my opinions because my brother's certainly didn't.&nbsp; 
I so enjoy discussing with you the books that you taught me to love, and the music and the flowers and everything.
Do you remember when it was just you and I, before Minerva's Tribunal and you introduced me to Shakespeare?
When sat on the floor in front of our fireplace, sharing a bottle of ice wine to get warm?"&nbsp; 

"Of course I remember.
We were snowed in and the roads were closed. 
As I recall, you were disappointed that we couldn't go out and buy the lights your first Christmas Tree.
We froze that afternoon cutting it down, our first tree together and then dragging it home." 
I replied, smiling and remembering that day, how she felt and how she smelled. 

"You started with Hamlet, Act 2., Scene 2".
She continued. 
"We were to take turns reading, and you started first, supposedly opening the book at random and starting to read. 
"Doubt thou the stars are fire! Doubt that the sun doth move; Doubt truth to be a liar; But never doubt I love."
Then you cleared your throat and took a sip of wine and started at the beginning of the play."&nbsp; 

"Do you remember afterwards.... you just held me.... nothing else.... and we fell asleep on the floor in front of the fire."

"I remember, Sarah"

"I'm not asking you to play favorites, because I know that you can't, but do you love me as much as Minerva?"&nbsp; 
Sarah asked, putting her head on my shoulder.&nbsp; 

"As a Master, you have put me in a precarious situation by asking such a question; discipline, order and harmony must be maintained. 
If I were I were a father with 2 daughters and I was asked such a question I would answer that I loved them both the same, and that would suffice. 
This situation is much more complicated and certainly more delicate in nature. 
There is no past wisdom to fall back on, not even in Shakespeare."&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 
"Therefore, until a precedent is set, my best course of action to honestly answer your question would be a conscious between you and Minerva and a mandate for you and Minerva never to discuss this fact with Katherine or Mandy. 
That would be the correct answer.... that, and for you to follow your heart."
I said, trying not to grin, being pleased with my clever answer.&nbsp; 

"Minerva is right, Michael, you can be so damn smug and deliberately evasive and obtuse at times.

"As a Master of the Sanctorum, I am well within my rights to take the belt to you for such impertinence, Sarah my love."
I told her while getting off the bike and putting my jeans and boots on, taking off my belt and folding it. 
I then snapped the belt with a sharp crack.

"You won't beat me, Master, that is not your way."
She replied, offering me her hand to help her down from the bike, which I did, and then she mussed my hair and kissed my mouth.
"I just wanted to hear you say it again in your own round about way, just as you did that night in front of the fire." 
Sarah announced, and then turned her back to me, adjusting her bra and blouse and then putting on her jeans.

I stood there with my arms folded watching her dress. 
When she bent over to tie the pink laces on her sneakers, I slapped her ass with my hand making her jump and stand quickly
to face me.

"Now who is being smug?"
I asked, watching her rub her smarting bottom and smile at me. 

"I was Michael, I mean Master."

"Come her, Princess." 
I ordered.

Sarah quickly complied and stood in front of me.

"Put your arms around my neck, slave."

She complied and was smiling as I put my arms around her waist and pulled her close.
"Do you have any Hershey Kisses for me, Master?"

"Don't change the subject, I'm still annoyed with your impertinence."
I kissed her saucy mouth, and then whispered in her ear.
"Who am I, my pretty and saucy girl?"&nbsp; 

"You are my Master and you love me."
She whispered, putting her head on my shoulder again. 
"And you are my Michael, and I love you." 

"What you say is true, I do love you, and not just as my slave, but as a person, that person being.... Sarah."
I whispered and I continued whispering and stroking her hair.
"You both have come a long way, you and Minerva, and your affection for one another compliments you both.
It is a special and unique thing that we have three have, Sarah, or for that matter the five of us.
For love humbles the Master or Mistress as well as the slave, the man, Michael and the women, be they Sarah or Minerva. 
Love transcends the flesh... in love we remain spiritual equals."&nbsp; 

"Now my dear, you know what to do. 
Let's put your saucy, impertinent little mouth to another good use."
I took the pink ribbon out of my pocket.

"Turn around and cross your wrists, my love."
I tied her wrists together with the ribbon. 
Then I took off my jacket and folded it for her to kneel on. 

Sarah knelt down on my jacket and I unbuttoned my fly and I took my manhood out for her to suck on. 
I gathered her hair in a ponytail to keep it out of her face, her long hair my love reins to control her during the oral pleasuring.
Sarah was all smiles and looking up at me. 
She started by kissing and licking the tip, her little tongue fluttering around it and her moist lips, caressing and teasing. 

Finally my pretty girl took my entire cock in her mouth, licking and sucking as I had taught her, it now being second nature to her,
knowing and sensing when my orgasms were about to crest and swallowing everything when I exploded in her mouth. 
When she finished, I untied her. 
Sarah brushed her hair and then we were on our way to the Black North. 

We arrived ten minutes ahead of my ladies and it was well past the dinner rush. 
I requested a table on the screened in porch overlooking the water to watch the boats come and go.
Sarah went into the ladies room to put it up her hair into a nice bun and to check her makeup.&nbsp; 
When they arrived, the hostess escorted my ladies to the table and I got up from my chair to greet them. 

They stood in the isle adjacent to the table, and one by one, I took their arms and then escorted them to their seats, pulling their chair out for them to sit down.
I did the same for Sarah when she arrived from the ladies room.&nbsp; 

We enjoyed a nice dinner together, ordering the Cajon broiled catfish with salt potatoes, an outstanding coleslaw, tangy with just a hint of horseradish, and then coffee, cheddar cheese with homemade apple pie, that was good, and that we all agreed couldn't, hold a candle to Sarah's.&nbsp; 
Before we left, my girls went to the ladies room.&nbsp; 

Afterwards we planned to meet at the end of breakwater to enjoy the view.
All my girls came out to wait with me except for Mandy, who seemed to be taking longer then usual.
Concerned, I went back inside to check on her.
The restrooms are located on the east side of the building in a corner near the bar. 
In order to get to the rest rooms one must walk past the bar to get to them.&nbsp; 

There were three men standing in front of her, blocking Mandy's path and trying to prevent her from leaving. 
The one blocking her access to the ladies room to keep her from going back inside was grabbing his crotch, pushing his cheek out with his tongue and licking his lips, the obscene inference most obvious. 
They were laughing, and trying to get her to drink with them, telling her to dump the faggot on the rice burner (meaning me) and ride with some real men, meaning them. 

I refer to them as weekend bikers, they being upper middle class to wealthy and riding expensive Harleys while pretending to be hardcore bikers on the fringe of society. 
Weekend warriors if you will, right down to their new unmarked leathers and two wearing lace-up knee high boots.&nbsp; 
One of the idiot clowns had a Chicago Police Department uniform patch sewn upside down on his new leather jacket.
This made him a target for the police to stop and investigate, the inference being that he "snuffed" (killed) a policeman or Corrections Officer.

This would make him even a bigger target with the real deal, particularly with a Hells Angel, whom would promptly kill him just out of general principles.... if he were that lucky.&nbsp; 
At least Snake would give him a chance to be a bitch and remove it, and then walk away, naked, his hog (Harley) being forfeit, if not..................... 

The largest of the clowns, the one with the patch; also the biggest idiot of the gaggle was wearing spurs... spurs, can you believe that?&nbsp; 
All three had bandanas tied on their heads to hide their hundred dollar plus haircuts, or trendy shaved heads, and one of the clowns was wearing wrist length black gloves with small pointed studs sewn into the knuckles to hide his manicured nails, while two of the three were wearing dark wrap around designer sunglasses, indoors.&nbsp; 

No doubt, they would not know how to check the oil on their scoots, let alone change it, disdaining to get their hands dirty. 
I saw these clowns dismount their ostentatious and ridiculous chrome accessorized motorcycles when they pulled into the parking lot. 
I was thinking at the time that the bikes were much like pretty women with big hair and wearing too much makeup, making them look cheap and trashy.&nbsp; 

I put my arm around Mandy's shoulder, as she was sitting closest to me and gave her a little hug because my ladies were none of those things and my little peach rewarded me with a thoughtful smile.&nbsp; 

I learned my lesson with my confrontation with Abzug; I wasn't as young as I used to be, or as fast. 
I was carrying my new taser, having made some modifications and improvements to the old model. 
I boosted the voltage up to 2.5 million volts and substituted the 9-volt alkaline battery with a small rechargeable 36-volt lithium ion/ tritium battery with an imbedded microchip of my design that is currently in use by the Mossad in their ultra-compact night vision goggles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

In consideration for this technology, they have provided me with a generous supply of a ceramic/ metal composite with almost 
non-existent impedance properties that I fashioned into the electrodes for the new taser. 
The advantage to the new model is that I do not have to makes direct contact with a person. 
Just a 1-inch gap or closer is all that is necessary to achieve the needed full effect. 

I am presently incorporating parts this new technology into a ladies compacts for my girls, waiting for the titanium cases to be machined. 
I will insert the titanium cases inside the ordinary plastic ones that can be bought anywhere makeup is sold.
They will be small and inconspicuous. 
They will function like a true ladies compact as well, but with electrifying results....&nbsp; if you will... no....&nbsp; please excuse my bad pun. 

I walked towards them and they turned to confront me. 
The biggest of the clowns was in front, he being the one with the spurs.&nbsp; 
He was making kissing sounds and sneering; for identification purposes, I will call him clown number one. 
I was watching his eyes, and as he led off with his left foot, he spun around and tried to kick me with his right, to slash or impale me with the sharpened spurs.

Being marginally familiar with the martial arts, most likely what he saw on TV or in the theatre and somewhat drunk, he telegraphed his movements, not to mention exposing his back with his clumsy attempt to slash me.
I moved to one side and zapped him with the taser, his fancy, new, leather jacket, embossed with the Harley logo making no difference as the 2.5 million volts entered his central nervous system. 

The second clown, clown number 2, grabbed his friend to keep him from crashing to the floor, his arms around number one, embracing him as if they were gay clown lovers.
I zapped the now occupied clown number two and they slumped to the floor in each other's arms.... that was funny.

This gave Mandy the opportunity to get past clown number three and get behind me.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Minerva and Sarah rushed over to Mandy hugging her and then stepped in front of Mandy, closing ranks. 
I glanced at the bartender, just standing there with his mouth open and his eyes were practically bugging out of his head. 
I would deal with him later, and realized at that point Katherine was nowhere to be seen.
This left clown numbers three, the clown wearing the spiked gloves and the ringleader of this gaggle of buffoons, and the one blocking the bathroom.

I definitely wanted a piece of this one and I walked towards him smiling and depressing the switch on the taser. 
Letting him watch and see what was in store for him as the electricity crackled and arced between the electrodes.

"You wouldn't be so tough without that thing!"
He exclaimed with false bravado while looking frantically around. 
Then he looked at the bartender, lifting his head slightly while rolling his eyes as if asking for help. 
This was a definite tell... I thought as much.&nbsp; 

"Perhaps...&nbsp; or perhaps not, clown."
I replied calmly.
"You have upset and disrespected my lady, and I will have my satisfaction. 
Did anyone of these buffoons touch you, or lay hands on you in any manner, Mandy?"
I asked, not taking my eyes off of him and overturning a table, giving me a clear path. 

"Yes Michael, he grabbed my crotch when I first tried to walk by him; be careful he has spikes on his gloves."

"And the others?"
I asked.

"They just laughed and made lewd suggestions."
Mandy replied. 

"I don't know how much you paid that whore to look the other way, or what your agreement was with him."
I said, pointing to the bartender.

"Minerva?"
I called, taking off my ring, and handing her the taser and ring as she stood beside. 
Minerva put the ring on her thumb, the samarium cobalt magnet contained within the titanium ring necessary to activate the tasers switch. 

"Keep an eye on the whore behind the bar."

I then slowly advanced on him, overturning tables and throwing chairs as he retreated, and projecting my voice as if I were actor upon a stage. "And Caesar's spirit, raging for revenge,
With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice, Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war, 
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth, 
With carrion men, groaning for burial." 
My tempered rage and inspiration; Julius Caesar, Act 3, Scene 1., so much for learning my lesson, even though the clown was younger then me, I still wanted a piece of his ass. 

Clown number three turned and bolted. 
In his panic, he ran into the ladies room by mistake and locked himself in.... tough guy.
The two clowns on the floor were starting to come out of it and Minerva zapped them again for good measure. 

The excitement was now pretty much over and I turned to find Mandy standing behind me. 
Mandy was trembling and looking like she wanted to cry.
Sarah was standing next to her and holding Mandy's hand. 
Minerva was standing at the end of the bar blocking the bartender's escape and glaring at him, daring him to try to leave.
Her beautiful green eyes were flashing, as if on fire, such was her rage. 
The bartender was looking down unable to meet her eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

I took my little peach in my arms and Mandy put her head on my chest, crying softly.
Katherine came in shortly afterwards, grinning, and walked over to Minerva and Sarah and started talking to them, quietly.
Sarah put her hand over her mouth to hide a smile, while turning her head briefly to look at me, while Minerva just nodded her head, and was smiling as well.

As for the rest, I will cut to the chase. 
The State Police did arrive and three arrests were made, the 3 clowns.&nbsp; 
Katherine and I were given appearance tickets and my taser was temporarily confiscated, but then returned at our hearing in town court after the charges were dropped against us. 
I put my ring back on and kept it not telling the police it's purpose, and therefore it was overlooked. 
I was right about the gaggle of buffoons; they were very cocky at first threatening me with high priced New York City Lawyers, which one of them was, and one of them was wealthy enough to have connections, however mine were better.

I allowed them to plead to 200 hours of community service, each, picking up trash along the road. 
This was their official sentence imposed by the court.
There were two unofficial stipulations and sanctions imposed upon them.&nbsp; 
Someone real scary talked to each of them, that person being an old friend of mine returning a favor.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The first stipulation was that they dress as circus clowns while performing the said community service and believe me, they did. 
The second was that after their Harley's were removed from the lake bottom at the end of the west breakwater, they would be
reconditioned at their expense and then donated to three small volunteer fire departments to be raffled off as a fundraisers.
Arthur suggested this stipulation.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

As for the bartender, out of the goodness of his heart he donated $5000.00 cash to the county animal shelter. 
His stipulations; first he make an appointment over the telephone requesting that a photographer be present, and that his picture be put in his local paper as a human interest story.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Then he would deliver the cash in person. 
The caveat, he would be dressed like a prostitute. 
This was Minerva's suggestion.
Starting with an expensive Elvira style wig, heavy and trashy makeup, he was dressed like a drag queen whore right down to red fishnet stocking and shocking pink high heel platform shoes.
This was very generous on my part when you consider that he whored himself to the clowns for a lousy two hundred dollars.&nbsp; 

That evening after we were done with the police, Mandy rode home with me on the back of the motorcycle, her long honey blond hair streaming behind like a banner. 
Unlike Sarah, Peaches (Mandy) had ridden before and didn't hold on quite so tight, knowing how to shift her weight in the turns.
We stopped on the way home for coffee and bagels.&nbsp; 
While I placed our order, she went into the bathroom to freshen up and brush her hair.
She was pleased to be allowed to wear her hair down and loose for me in public and sat close next to me squeezing my hand while we enjoyed our coffee and bagels and just talked, Mandy glad to be out alone with me and I with her. 

Mandy would be sleeping with me that night in consideration for what she had been through, and my ladies were waiting up for us in the kitchen when we arrived home.
There was no discussion, I ordered Mandy upstairs, and then followed, leaving my ladies in the kitchen. 
As I was walking up the stairs, I could almost feel their smiles caressing my back... yes life was definitely good.&nbsp; 

As is my custom, Mandy and I showered before soaping each other down and then shampooing each other's hair.
I left the bathroom first, leaving Mandy to blow dry her hair, and Minerva was waiting for me outside of her bedroom.&nbsp; 
She put her arms around my neck and kissed my mouth, tasting like mint toothpaste, as did I, and then she whispered. 

"You can be such a bastard, Master, goodnight."
And then smiling, she let go and turned to leave. 

"Not so fast my impertinent redhead bitch." 
I whispered back, giving her buttocks a familiar little squeeze, and then grabbing her shoulders gently to turn her around.
I returned her kiss, hugging her tight.

Then Minerva went into her bedroom and closed the door and Sarah opened hers and stepped out.
Sarah walked up to me, and then I took both her hands in mine and pulled her close. 
I then kissed my pretty girl's sweet mouth, fresh and clean from a recent brushing and then sent her to bed, wishing her a "goodnight".

Last, but certainly not least was Katharine, coming out of her room when Sarah closed her door.
"Katherine." I said sternly while glaring at her.
"Come here and assume the position."
I pointed at my feet, and she did. 
"Of all my ladies, I always thought you were one of the most level headed.
Have you any idea how much those Harleys are going to cost me?"

And then turning, I said.
"Minnie, Sarah, move away from your doors right now and get into bed or there might be three girls leashed to the pole before the night is through."

I heard two sets of feet scurrying and then Mandy darted from the bathroom into my bedroom closing the door quietly behind her. 

Turning back to Katherine, I said, harshly.
"Heel, slave and look at your Master."
Katherine came up from the floor into a kneeling position, looking frightened.

"Put your arms behind your back and keep them there.
I gathered all her long hair into a ponytail and twisted it around my hand until it was tight to her scalp.
"You have such beautiful long thick long hair, Katherine, do you know what you have forced me to do now?"&nbsp; 

"Please, Master, don't ....................."

"Be silent."
I loudly commanded, as Katherine swallowed and closed her eyes.
"Stand, slave, you brought this on yourself and are only getting what you deserve for your impulsive actions."

You could hear a pin drop...................................................
No doubt Sarah, Mandy and Minerva were holding their breath straining to listen through the closed doors.&nbsp; 

I kissed her mouth long and deep, and Katherine opened her eyes in surprise as I let go of her hair, letting it drop down her back.&nbsp; 
I put my index finger in front of my lips and winked at her, smiling. 

"As I was saying, my voluptuous and buxom Katherine, hear my sentence.
For your wonderfully impulsive, clever, although expensive actions of putting three Harleys into neutral, pushing them one by one to the end of breakwater and then into the Lake."

"I said get away from the doors ladies".... and then I heard two sets of feet, plus one more, scurrying again.&nbsp; 

"I will be sending you to medical school.
This is something that I know you have always wanted, and that you thought was beyond your reach when you signed your contract with the Sanctorum. 
I am sure that we will all be proud with having a Doctor of Medicine in our family...right ladies?"

"Yes, Michael!"
Minerva, Sarah and Mandy all said in unison, opening their doors as Katherine hugged me with tears of happiness running down her face, as I was hugging her and wiping those tears. 

"Ladies....&nbsp; hallway, now!" 
I shouted, and the three came out of their rooms and lined up side by side.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Katherine joined them, wiping the remaining tears from her face and smiling, as they all were. 

"Assume the position ladies... very nice, and don't think for a minute that I didn't know you all were running in place and not in bed."
I lifted their white silk nightgowns and gave each of them a sound slap on the ass, including Katherine. 
"Order and discipline will be maintained in this household as well as your obedience, heel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Minerva and Sarah, it is bedtime, goodnight.�
They each received a kiss and hug for me, and I sent them on their way. 

"Katherine and Mandy?"

"Yes, Michael."
They said, again. 

"I'm really not sleepy after all that has happened today and I feel quite amorous. 
You will both be sharing my bed this evening and we will be sleeping in late."

"May we fix our hair for you, Michael?"

"Yes, Katherine, and you may choose the styles." 

When they returned they were carrying extra pillows and a blanket. 

They both had fixed their hair into ponytails and their faces were makeup free, freshly scrubbed and glowing. 
As they came bustling into the bedroom, they looked so happy and wholesome as if they were "attending a slumber party".... that's what I was thinking at the time. 

I was lying on my back as they came in naked and then got into bed with me, one on either side.&nbsp; 
I sat up, propping my pillows again the headboard, taking a girl in each arm and hugging them, and stroking their soft and thick ponytails.

Katherine went down on me first, licking the tip of my manhood and then the shaft while Mandy and I were kissing, and I was playing with Mandy's breasts and stroking her sweet flower. 
Soon, Mandy was kissing my face and neck, working her down my chest and groin to help Katherine. 
They were taking turns sucking and licking my cock while kissing each other long and deep as I watched.
I took their hair out of the ponytails so that I could feel it teasing my chest and groin while they continued licking and sucking my cock and balls.

I came in Mandy's mouth and she swallowed all of my semen; my orgasm was indescribable, nevertheless I was soon hard again.
Two lovely women in the same bed will do that to a man.
Katherine likes it a little rough and I grabbed hold of her hair, pulling, and then ordered Mandy to get on her back and told her to close her eyes.

I forced Katherine's face into Mandy's dripping vagina ordering Katherine to lick and play with herself. 
After a time, I shoved my cock into Katherine's dripping, swollen pussy.
I slapped Katherine's voluptuous ass as I rammed her, while she was licking Mandy's dripping swollen pussy with abandon.
They both were moaning loudly and I so wanted to orgasm again, but I held back. 
Mandy was the first to come, and then Katherine, both of them bucking and squirming. 

I again grabbed Katherine by her hair, wrapping my hand in it pushed her face into my rock hard welcoming cock.
I had my second orgasm coming in her mouth and afterwards Katherine swallowed everything. 
She and Mandy licked my cock and balls clean, as I lay there relaxed and satisfied.&nbsp; 
I was absolutely spent by then and feeling as weak as a kitten, and sleepy... so sleepy, imagining that I was one being licked clean by two sexy mother cats. 

I just lay there until they finished, and then cuddling up on either side of me.&nbsp; 
I kissed them both before drifting off into a calm and blissfull sleep................. 

I woke up late the next morning to find Mandy and Katherine gone and Minerva sitting on the bed with a tray of bagels with cream cheese, smoked fish, honey dew melon and a carafe of coffee. 
I sat up and arranged the pillows for us to lean against the headboard. 

"With everything going on lately I thought that we might never get a chance to talk about Martha."
Minerva said, getting next to me and pouring two cups of coffee from the carafe, taking hers and then placing the tray on my lap. 
I noticed that Minerva had her hair done up in a French twist, wonderful, apparently it was long enough for this elegant style now and she was wearing a vibrant red silk kimono with white chrysanthemums over her white silk nightgown.&nbsp; 

I reached over to stroke the soft hair at the nape of her neck.&nbsp; 
"You look lovely, my love, good enough to eat and your hair is very elegant and sexy." 

"That is how I will be wearing until it is long enough for a nice bun... Mickey." 
She said, teasing, I could see the amusement in her eyes, even though she said it with a straight face.

Mickey, short for Michael, and term of endearment with a little story behind it.
Martha called me Mickey when we were first married, in the days when I thought she loved me, and before we lost our child.... my son.... my boy, Aaron, and I cried at the time remembering a quote by Roman Polanski.

"If you have a great passion it seems that the logical thing is to see the fruit of it, and the fruit are children". 
Afterwards, I internalized my grief for my son, while my wife wore it on her sleeve and accused me of being cold and heartless. 
 
No matter what I did or said after that there was no pleasing Martha, and eventually I stopped trying. 
For whatever reason, Martha blamed me for the death of our son and the complications that rendered her sterile.
She completely let herself go, becoming quite obese, although she kept herself clean, paying particular attention to her perfect teeth. 
Martha denied me sex and cut her beautiful long hair brutally short to spite me. 

When we were first married, Martha was a small, petite woman with much the same figure as Mandy.
Martha had such beautiful long black hair, being thick and soft, falling just to the middle of her back.
Of Portuguese decent on her mother's side, Martha has the same rich black hair, dark onyx eyes and the prefect light olive complexion of her mother.&nbsp; 

She also has a hot fiery temper. 
One to match Minerva's, and Martha can swear up a blue streak in Portuguese when angry. 
Unlike Minerva, whose anger is tempered and controlled, Martha can be spitefully inventive, and has a tendency to throw and break things.&nbsp; 
For example, she sold most of my music collection to a flea market promoter for pennies on the dollar while I was away on business. When I returned from Japan, to find my records and cassette tapes gone, I was served with divorce my papers, via a singing telegram the same day. 

When angry, Martha would often strike me, although I easily blocked her ineffectual blows and kicks making her even angrier still.&nbsp; 
I never hit her back.... if she hurt herself hitting me, so be it. 
An only child, her parents doted on her giving her everything that she asked for.... Martha was a spoiled brat. 

I took my marriage vows seriously, "for better or for worse", making the best of a bad situation and throwing myself into my work. 
I felt betrayed when Martha left me and filed for divorce, as if my grief was any less real then hers, and then trying to have me thrown
out of own home, property that owned before I married her. 
I never strayed or had an affair while we were married.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

The last time that Martha had called me Mickey was the day I confronted Frank Abzug, when she fainted in my arms.

"Why did she call you that, Michael? 
Was it Mickey for the mouse?
Minnie and Mickey?"
She said, lightly, and laughing, she not possibly knowing the man from my past, the man, the father never to be, Mickey. 
Mickey was buried with his son. 
The only other person who knows this is Arthur.&nbsp; 
Arthur felt my pain, I saw it in his face when we talked in my Library, on the day the enforcers took the offal scum away.... he told me a little about his nephew, knowing that I would never betray a confidence. 

Minerva saw the pain in my face, even though I tried to hide it with a smile. 
"I'm sorry Michael, I was only teasing and I can see that you don't want to talk about that. 
May we still talk about Martha?"

"Come closer."
I said, putting the tray on the floor, and she put her coffee on the tray and then got close putting her head on my lap. 
"You are intuitive as well as beautiful, my Marvelous Minerva and I love you.
I lightly stroked her beautiful face, and continued until I finished my story. 
I will take you into my confidence a second time my love.... let me tell you about my son.............................."

Minerva listened to my story, not interrupting to ask questions.
I sat and held her for a while, just enjoying our intimacy.
Finally, she spoke.

"I never realized why you were so bitter, at first, Michael... so very bitter.
You showed up at my dance studio unshaved, and in desperate need of a haircut. 
You were wearing faded blue jeans, a white tee shirt, and engineer boots.
I couldn't figure out how you got past security, and classes were not starting for two hours and then by appointment only. 
I was watching you from a live feed on my laptop in my office, and I thought you were a bum without two nickels to rub together. 

"I watched you for two months before I went to your studio, my love.
I had business with the bank across the street from your building when I first saw you. 
You had your hair pinned up, and were wearing a dark brown skirt and jacket, a white ruffled silk blouse, tan stocking and dark brown
pumps when you walked into the bank, and you were all business... no nonsense. 

You walked in the Bank like you owned the place, walking past me, never giving me a second glance. 
You walked right in the Bank President's Office, closing the door behind you and taking my appointment.
I was annoyed and intrigued.... I made some polite inquires and decided to meet you, despite your best efforts to keep me out."

"Why didn't you tell me all this before, Michael?"

"Because, I was waiting for the right opportunity."
I answered. 

"Well as you remember I'm sure, my secretary refused to give you an appointment or let you talk to me." 

"I remember."

"You told her that when you returned from business on the West Coast in two week you would be returning with flowers.

"Yes, and Donna your secretary told me to leave now and never come back or she was calling the police.... I left, didn't I?"

"You certainly did and we thought it hysterical that a bum whom was lucky enough to get past security had business on the West Coast.
I thought we would never see you again.&nbsp; 
When the telephones and intercoms were working again, and as a precaution, we called the police and reported you as a stalker.
I assumed at that time everything was a coincidence because of the Telephone Company truck parked outside and............

"Michael, you didn't?"

"Perhaps, or perhaps not."
I answered.

"You just vanished and nobody saw you leave, and the tapes from the security system were somehow completely erased.
"How did you do that, Michael?"

"It's a secret and I shall not tell you"

"Michael?"

"Minerva!"

"OK, Mr. Magician, be that way, I beefed up security, and then you got in a second time and I hardly recognized you, you clean up so nice."
"My secretaries office was full of flowers when I arrived, pots of peace lilies, hundreds of them, with cards addressed to me. 
I suppose you won't tell you how you did that either?" 

"Nope"

"There you were, sitting at my desk wearing a black tuxedo, and one that was custom tailored just for you, I can tell these things. 
Your feet were on my desk...my desk!&nbsp; 
The audacity, if I could have called security I would have.&nbsp; 
Your hands folded on your chest, and your top hat tipped over your eyes. 

Really Michael, you have such a flair for the dramatic.... cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war. 
I can't believe that Martha could possibly find you so uninteresting that she left you for that lump, Frank Abzug. 

"Martha changed, especially after the stillbirth. 
Even after we were first married, all she wanted was a large family, the children to be the main focus in her life; sex was for the propagation of children; Martha was a virgin on our wedding night.&nbsp; 
Martha's Mother and Aunts had great influence with her, and I should have seen it coming; I loved her Minerva." 

Forget about her for now....&nbsp; I was fascinated and flattered that you got in a second time and you looked so different. 
Cleaned up with a shave and haircut, top hat and cane and the flowers... how could you possibly know that I adored lilies?
Then you leapt over the desk and bowed to me with a flourish, you pretended to hand me your business card, which was blank, but took my hand instead in your strong-callused hand, so out of place for a man wearing a tailored tuxedo and you bowed a second time
and not letting go said: 

"The modest Rose puts forth a thorn,
The humble sheep a threat'ning horn:
While the Lily white shall in love delight,
Nor a thorn nor a threat stain her beauty bright."

William Blake (November 28, 1757&#8211;August 12, 1827) was an English poet, painter, and printmaker, Ms. Flynn. 
I wish I were as eloquent as he, but alas, I remain a thorn without a rose to stain your beauty bright. 

Then you explained that all you wanted was a chance in the advanced ballroom dance class to brush up on your skills and prove your mettle...well, you know the rest, how could I possibly refuse, we moved as one. 

"Dancing is like riding a bike, my dear, you never forget."
I replied. 

"You need to treat her with a firm hand, Michael, and set limits for her. 
You certainly can't allow her to hit and swear at you.... I was thinking out loud, of course you won't. 
That being said, with us it is different, you bastard."
She whispered, squeezing and kissing my hand.

"Impertinent bitch, you certainly are not setting a good example for Sarah."
I replied smiling.&nbsp; 
"Martha has a temper, and in this department is your equal.
While yours is tempered and controlled, hers is not." 

"What if Martha acts up and you are not around?"
She asked.

"I'm putting you in charge, my love.
You will be Mistress of the house and the keeper of the keys over Martha. 
The girls will follow your lead. 
If Martha acts like a spoiled, petulant child, treat her like one."

"Seriously, Michael, I understand why you did not hit her back when you were married. 
But how could you live with her without having sex.... without intimacy, that I don't quite understand. 
You are such a passionate and loving man."

"I had my work, my inventions, loyal employees whom I had a responsibility for, and their families."

"Nevertheless, since you want my advice, don't bend over backwards to appear fair or feel too sorry because of her bad choices."&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Minerva advised.
"I should be thankful, for if it not for those bad choices, I would have never met you, or loved you the way that I do now."&nbsp; 

"You will forgive her betrayal Michael, as you forgave mine, because that is the type of man you are. 
When you are angry, it seems that you have no fear, confronting the clowns like that, you could have been hurt."

"I knew what I was doing."
I replied.

"True, and you could have still been hurt.
Never forget you are a friend and confidant of a Grand Master whom wields the power of life and death.
You most likely will be Arthur's successor."&nbsp; 

"One more thing and then I will keep quiet, you are right; we are of the Sanctorum, you and I. 
After experiencing both facets of it, I never have been happier. 
When you look at me it is if you are caressing me with your eyes.... you look the same way at Sarah. 
You know what else I think, Michael?" 

"You said one more thing."
I reminded her.

"That was just a figure of speech and you know it."

"Please continue my love."
I said, blowing on her neck. 

"I don't think that I shall."
She retorted.

"Are we going to start that again, Minnie?"

"You want the truth, Michael? Do you want the truth?
I don't think that you can handle the truth!"
 
"Try me."

"You are prickly to touch as a hedge is, 
Or as soft as eiderdown fluff, 
Sharp or quite smooth at the edges,
My Master, my Michael.... my love.... you would have made a Marvelous father."&nbsp; 

"That was very nice, Minerva."
I said swinging my legs over the side of the bed and reaching for my tray.
If I remember correctly, perhaps my voice may have been breaking when I said that. 

Minerva then pushed me down on the bed and put her hand over my mouth.

"I am not done speaking, be silent.
You are not getting off that easy, Buster."
She said harshly, going into her mean, Mistress Mode. 
"I have an announcement to make."  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;` &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;`

And then she leaned forward and bit my ear lightly, whispering. 
"It is my turn to be on top.... with your permission of course......................"

The week that Martha would be released to me had finally arrived. 
I would be going alone to Arthur's Estate in Martha's Vineyards to get her.
Arthur would be flying home from Australia from a business trip and she would be waiting for me there. 
In the event that he was delayed I was to wait for him and Maud would see to my needs.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

A point of clarification; I mentioned earlier that after Maud's Tribunal I made no claim on her person. 
On paper Maud is the community property of the Sanctorum.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
For practical purposes she is now Arthur's personal secretary... perhaps his lover. 
She is also a cook and housekeeper on occasion; Maud is forever a slave. 

As community property it is my right to have Maud if I so desire as may any Master or Grand Master.&nbsp; 
Maud has served several Grand Masters now and she was deliberately passed around to humble her as part of her punishment.
No doubt it was Maud's hope that she would be immediately purchased and shielded by Arthur or myself.
Maud has been with Arthur for the past four months.

I know for a fact that Arthur eventually intends to purchase her from the Sanctorum and I doubt that anyone out of respect for him will stand in his way. I certainly won't and I have first consideration if Maud were to be put up for sale. 
Therefore if problems do arise I remain Arthur's ace in the hole.&nbsp; 
 
The thought has occurred to me, the desire to have and to own the former Grand Mistress, Maud. 
It was and is my right to ravage Maud upon her being found guilty and Minerva as well; that precedent was set long before I was born. Their actions could have resulted in my death if I was found guilty of their false charges and planted evidence. 
Fortunately I had taken precautions. 

I remember well the first time I met regal Maud. In saying this I am in no way being sarcastic or flippant.&nbsp; 
Maud held audience as if she were a Queen and I a serf being granted a favor or indulgence by her offer to purchase Sarah.
She was gracious yet aloof, dignified and refined; in short Maud was a presence not to be ignored.... so much better challenge. 

Maud was wearing a deep purple dress. This rich purple is reserved for Grand Mistresses for all formal Gathering of the Sanctorum. Maud's long dark brown hair was pulled back into a braided chignon at the nape of her neck. 
I observed barely noticeable hints of silver gray at the roots of her temples as I studied her.

Most likely she dyed her long hair.&nbsp; Maud is as tall as Minerva and at that time 30 lbs heavier and is exactly 20 years older; they share the same birthday.&nbsp; While Maud may have let herself go a bit, however she remains a beautiful woman and was by far... by far wealthier then Minerva could ever hope to be; most of her wealth is now mine. 

Maud was also wearing an 18- karat gold filigree tiara in her hair. 
It was adorned with a flawless marquee cut 6-carat amethyst gemstone of a magnificent dark purple color.
The tiara represents the Grand Mistress's symbol of office and was something that Minerva always coveted. 
Masters and Grand Masters have a simple gold signet ring with the seal of the Sanctorum. 
The upper right hand corner shield of the coat of arms on the Master's ring is left blank. 
When a Master achieves Grand Master a single carnation is engraved in this mentioned corner. 
Masters and Grand Masters did not have an official color and we dress as we please.&nbsp; 
 
Maud was in her mid-fifties when I first met her, when I first looked into her haughty blue eyes. 
Those same blue eyes sized me up and dared me to refuse her offer and then counter offer.&nbsp; 

I was polite and met her gaze.&nbsp; I was thinking; "so much like Minerva.'&nbsp; "I would love to take her hair down to see how long it is." 
These were the censored thoughts while the rest...&nbsp; I am sure that you get the idea.&nbsp; 

The last thing that Maud expected from me was that I would turn her down; politely of course and be looking for tells.&nbsp; 
Her hands were folded on her lap when I refused her.&nbsp; I watched Maud catch herself as she squeezed her bottom hand with her top hand in annoyance or anger at my audacity.&nbsp; Plus the fact that Maud was aware that I observed her hand movements and saw the amusement in my eyes at discovering her tells. Maud was watching me intently as well.&nbsp; 

Minerva was absolutely beside herself with anger and embarrassment although she concealed it well; aside from the flashes of fire in her beautiful green eyes. I had every right to refuse Maud, Grand Mistress that she was then.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

The laws of the Sanctorum are few.&nbsp; A slave, Master, Mistresses, Grand Master or Grand Mistress are expected to know them by heart and they are to be carried with them always.

Justice is swift and sure and the penalties are determinant and harsh. As a case in point, you are either innocent or guilty. 
Extenuating circumstances are seldom taken into consideration. 
Appeals are rare requiring the seating of the fifty and are not to be taken lightly. 

Back to Arthur&#8217;s estate:
Arthur has a large estate complete with a stable and barn for his riding horses. 
The servant's quarters are separate from the main house and remain unoccupied.

He keeps a Holstein cow for fresh raw milk.&nbsp; He has a small fieldstone chicken coop with chickens for fresh brown eggs; bacon &amp; eggs with home fried potatoes and buttered toast being his favorite meal by far.&nbsp; 
Even though he is a man of immense wealth and power Arthur has never forgotten his roots having grown up on a farm.

It is not beneath him to clean out his stables, barn and coop or to feed and care for his animals and I dare say that he enjoys it.&nbsp; 
By contrast Arthur's house is opulent with marble, slate and granite floors. 
It has 11 full baths for each bedroom and many other rooms and galleries.&nbsp; 

If I decide to add Martha to my household every bedroom upstairs will now be occupied; bedrooms that Martha once hoped would be full of children; bedrooms that I one hoped would be full of children. 

When I arrived at the airport the limousine service brought me out to Arthur's gated estate and we went through the two armed security checkpoints.&nbsp; At the second checkpoint I got out of the limo and sent the driver on his way intending to walk the 1000 yards or so to the main house carrying my waxed canvas duffle bag. 

I had not seen or talked to Maud since her Tribunal. We had much to talk about and I was still curious to find out how long her hair was among other things.&nbsp; Assuming that Arthur made no changes to Maud's hair because I doubt the other Grand Masters did. 
As I said before out of respect for Arthur...or perhaps fear. 

When I arrived at the Mansion one of the two cleaning ladies, Paula answered the door while glancing over my shoulder looking for the limo. Arthur employs two frumpy and plump ladies of Italian decent to come in every other day to clean. 
They are sisters and spinsters, discrete, very well paid and fiercely loyal to him.&nbsp; They lost their childhood home to taxes, further complicated by the actions of crooked land developers and politicians; politicians being crooked is a given.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Arthur paid the delinquent taxes and then put a halt to the bogus claims of eminent domain.&nbsp; The limousine service that brought me here is the same one that brings them to and from work and for them that is a perk of the job. 

"Good afternoon, Paula. You are looking as lovely as ever." I smiled at her as I watched her touch her hair and then return my smile.&nbsp; �Is Maria working today? Sarah sent 3 pounds of her pecan fudge." I opened the large side pocket on my bag intending on giving it to her.&nbsp; 

"Maria is in the kitchen preparing you a little snack. You must be famished from your long trip. 
Ms. McCabe (she was referring to Maud) is waiting for you in the East Drawing Room. She has been primping like a peacock all morning. Please thank Sarah for the fudge.... such a cook she is!&nbsp; Are you sure that she not just a little Italian? Well, at least you are half on your Mama's side!&nbsp; And Catholic, praise the Madonna." She said, making the Sign Of The Cross. 

These two ladies had no idea that Maud was a slave of the Sanctorum. It was explained to them by Arthur that Maud was his personal secretary. On the surface that was exactly what she was. 

From the tone of Paula's voice I believed that she resented Maud being there.&nbsp; Although they were approximately the same age as Maud, Paula and Maria are not as beautiful, or as refined or as educated.&nbsp; However they are both fabulous cooks and Maria's Veal Marsala surpasses Salvatore's.&nbsp; Maud and Minerva are Harvard Graduates with a PhDs in Business/Mathematics as well as a M.A. in English Literature. No doubt these Ladies may even be a little intimidated by Maud.... as for me; Maud will be my bed partner for the duration of my stay.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

I gave Paula the fudge and followed her into the kitchen. Maria was laying out platters, plates and bowls containing Genoa Salami, sweet and sour headcheese, hard dry pepperoni, capiccola, soprsotta and sharp provolone cheese. There were black olives and green olives stuffed with raw garlic; the black olives were sprinkled with coarse sea salt and red pepper flakes. 

There was crusty Italian bread, plus sweet or hot roasted red peppers tossed in olive oil with whole roasted garlic cloves. 
There was a cold refreshing salad made with pealed segmented orange sections tossed with cold pressed extra virgin olive oil and freshly ground coarse black pepper and finally... homemade cannolis... just a little snack. 

I sat in the kitchen with them and ate while they fussed over me. I was enjoying my meal with a small glass of Carlo Rossi Paisano Chianti an inexpensive table wine that they favored and something that my Italian Grandfather, my mother's father drank.
While they cleaned the kitchen to their exacting specifications, I was working on the cannolis trying to make them go away and drinking cappuccino; salute Grandpa.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

When, tired of waiting Maud came walking into the kitchen and was quite annoyed with them.&nbsp; 
"I believe that I asked you two ladies to inform me immediately when the Limousine pulled up in front of the house did I not?" 
Maud asked in a demanding tone while standing there tall and regal like the Grand Mistress that she once was.

"Yes Ms. McCabe, you did." 
Paula answered, looking at her sister, knowingly. 

"Then why didn't advise me that Mr. Buckley was here?"
Maud asked a second time. 

"Because the Limousine did not pull up and Mr. Buckley walked from the second checkpoint and he looked famished. 
We can't have a guest and friend of Mr. Arthur go hungry, Ms. McCabe." Maria replied slyly.&nbsp; 

"Your ride is here Ladies and we won't need your services for the next five days. I will telephone you if things change. 
We will definitely discuss this matter at a later date when there are no distractions.�&nbsp; Maud informed them before turning her attention to me. 

"Mr. Buckley."

"Yes, Ms. McCabe." I replied just as formally for the benefit of Paula and Maria. 

"Ms. Cardoso (Maud was referring to Martha's maiden name) is waiting for you in the East Gallery."

"Thank you, Ms. McCabe. I am looking forward to seeing her, but first you and I need to clear the air about a few things.
We had so little time the last time we were together. Please wait for me in the Billiard Room. I need to see these lovely Ladies to their chariot."&nbsp; I then offered Paula and Maria an arm and then escorted them out leaving Maud standing there.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

When I returned to the kitchen I finished my cappuccino before going the Billiard Room carrying my duffle bag.&nbsp; I closed and locked the door before putting the bag on the floor by the dry bar.&nbsp; Maud immediately assumed the position on the floor now that we were alone. 

"You may heel, slave." I said, keeping my voice neutral. Maud put her hand at the base of her throat; a gesture asking permission to speak and I shook my head for no.&nbsp; This is something that I taught all my girls and something that was no doubt was brought up in conversation between her and Minerva when they were free women; Grand Mistress and Mistress. 

"You will now stand with your hands at your side so that I can get a good look at you and so far I like what I see." 

Maud was wearing a navy cocktail dress with a black lace embellished bodice plus a sheer black lace elbow length sleeves and a scooped off the shoulder neckline. The shirred natural waist gave her figure the appearance of a slight hourglass shape while the pencil skirt accented her curves. 

This dress had what Minerva would call a flirtatious black lace hemline... very nice.&nbsp; 
The silver open toe high heels that she was wearing definitely added a nice movement to her hips as she walked; while the dress accented her ample bosom... very nice indeed. 
Especially since Maud had lost a good thirty pounds since I had last seen her. 

I walked up behind her and put my hands around her waist rubbing her taut flat tummy thinking; "It is hard to believe this siren is a woman pushing sixty because if I didn't know better I would have guessed late thirties or early forties despite the hair." 

I could smell her complex perfume mixed with her natural scent.... much like the nose of mature vintage Merlot, rich and complex.... each sip a subtle taste or nuance.&nbsp; Being close to her like this was like a carnal epiphany.... no wonder Arthur wanted Maud all to himself and I envied him.&nbsp; With Arthur's tacit approval I would savor her and I was looking forward to it. 

Maud's hair was stripped of the artificial brown dye that she once used to hide her gray; however hers was not an ordinary gray. 
Maud's hair was now her own natural burnished silver gray color that suited her much better.&nbsp; 
Her hair was pinned up in a simple cinnamon bun at the back of her head. 

Judging from the size of her bun, I would estimate that when Maud's hair was down and loose would now fall to the bottom of her shoulder blades. At some point Maud's much longer hair had had been cut.&nbsp; 

She was wearing minimal makeup, but wearing it well; eyeliner, mascara, eye shadow and such.&nbsp; 
Maud has wonderfully clear, wrinkle free skin, the exception being the laugh lines at the corner of her eyes. 
These gave her face character; character that a young woman if lucky might eventually earn. 
Even though Maud&#8217;s posture was that as a slave, her intelligent blue eyes were still all encompassing although no longer haughty. 

God bless him, Arthur had no intention breaking Maud's spirit.
And the process he spoke of, the one used to help Martha forget her nightmare about that scumbag Abzug must hold other surprises.

"I want you to walk to the end of the room and then stand by the billiard table.&nbsp; You know exactly what I am talking about. 
You are dressed this way to entice me and you have succeeded.&nbsp; You still do not have permission to speak."
I commanded as she once did and then I slapped her shapely ass most disrespectfully.&nbsp; 

Maud did exactly that and her hips were swaying nicely as she slowly walked on the silver heels and stopped where I pointed; at the floor in front of the pool table. 

"Very nice my dear, very nice; obviously you have been dieting and exercising I approve of your hair. 
It is such a beautiful burnished silver gray that I will have my hands in shortly. 
You look quite exotic and the silver color sets off the blue of your eyes.
You have permission to answer questions only; turn around and face away from me."

I unzipped Maud&#8217;s dress and then slid it down her shoulders and hips and letting it drop to her ankles for her to step out of. 
Underneath the dress Maud was wearing a lacey black bra, lacey black panties and black garter belt to hold up her stockings. 
As I was removing her bra I asked. "How long was your hair before Arthur had it cut?"

"It just touched the bottom of my buttocks, Master."

I stroked her breasts watching her shudder as her nipples hardened at my touch leaving me to wonder if this was a result of the process that Arthur mentioned. I then kissed and blew on the back of her neck watching the goose bumps on her arms and shoulders... interesting; I never took her for the goose bump type. As for her panties, I simply ripped them at the seams leaving her dressed in the garter belt, stockings and silver heels.

I again blew on her neck and then kissed Maud behind her ears while smelling her perfume while my right hand was lightly caressing her shaved vagina and I commented.&nbsp; "Such an interesting scent; I can't place the perfume it is very complex; I also notice that your clitoral hood has been pierced.

"Arthur gets the perfume from a little shop in Egypt and it was blended especially for me. 
I'm not sure what it is called or if it even has a name.... that feels so good, Master.&nbsp; The piercings heighten my arousal."

"I wouldn't have guessed that you are so easily aroused and those precious goose bumps."
Have you always been this way? 

"No, Master?"&nbsp; 

"You may address me as Master Michael for the present." 
I offered while removing the hairpins to take her hair down.&nbsp; 
"Under the circumstances those changes are for the best as no doubt they will be for Martha...yes, the last one.&nbsp; 

I dropped the last hairpin to the floor and stroked her long thick ponytail. 
"No layers, this is just the way I like it, blunt cut to all one length."
I let go of her ponytail and then took a step back.&nbsp; "Take the elastic tie out of your ponytail and then shake your head."

Maud did as she was told tossing her head and I watched her silver tresses flow over her neck, back, shoulders and then caress her breasts. 

"Excellent...how I envy Arthur!&nbsp; 
As you remember I treated you with respect and kept my word to you about Minerva before the Enforcers took you both away for trial.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I did not publicly rape or beat you after your Tribunal as is my right.&nbsp; 
That was then and this is now...you have a debt to pay and if I am well satisfied I will not beat you." 

I stepped to her and roughly buried my hands in her hair and kissed her lips. 
"You are mine for the moment and despite everything I have brought you a gift." 

I walked over to my duffle bag and returned with a bottle of Gekkeikan, a Japanese Plum Wine that I knew to be her favorite. 
I put the bottle on the pool table and then picked her up. 
I put Maud on top the pool table so that her feet hanging over the edge. 
Her surprised reaction to being manhandled handled in such a manner made me smile. 
Inspired and pleased I kissed her mouth a second time followed by whispering in her ear and blowing on her neck to be rewarded with more goose bumps. "You will remove your remaining clothing while I get a glass from the bar."
I returned with a small glass; the type having a wide body, narrow mouth and a straight lip; a glass perfect for this type of sweet wine.&nbsp; After pouring the wine, I held it up to the light to admire the pale amber color before dipping my index finger into it and then tracing my wet finger on Maud's lips for her to taste while I took a sip. 
Maud licked her lips and my finger. Then she took the glass when I offered it to her, sipping from it and then handing it back to me to take a sip.&nbsp; Pushing her long hair aside I then dipped my finger several more times painting lines from the base of her throat to the middle of her breasts. 
Then I traced the outline of her areolas, nipples; and finally her mouth before draining the remaining wine from the glass 
I dropped the glass to the slate floor and then ground it violently beneath my engineer boot certain that a woman of Maud's intellect, imagination and instincts would realize the symbolism of such and act and she did by closing her eyes and waiting; Maud was trembling. 
Grabbing Maud's hair with my right hand I pulled her head back to expose her throat. Then I kissed her mouth long and deep tasting the wine on her lips and tongue; she was mine for the duration.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Still tugging at her hair I picked up her legs which were still dangling over edge of the billiard table and pivoted Maud on her shapely ass and then forced her to lie prone on the red felt of the billiard table. 
I spread her legs and stroked her wet pussy while probing her flower, still holding her head down on the table by her hair. 
Maud's hips were moving from side to side and she was arching her back slightly as my fingers slowly caressed her sweet clitoris and wet musky vagina.&nbsp; She was moaning softly yet hesitantly as if embarrassed at her own arousal...interesting?&nbsp; 
Maud was certainly vulnerable with me standing over her while I roughly held down by her hair. Perhaps she was still expecting a beating; she was aroused nevertheless.
I let go of her hair and kissed her mouth. I then kissed and licked her neck and the base of her throat while working my way down to her breasts and nipples while continuing to caress her dripping vagina.&nbsp; Maud's eyes were open now and she was looking up at me with those beautiful blue eyes and she was taking everything in.
She hesitated and then reached up to..." You may touch me my dear." I offered.&nbsp; "I am not going to beat you as that would serve no useful purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not need revenge for revenges sake and I have quite forgiven your transgression. 
Without it I would never have loved my marvelous Minerva as I love her now. In fact I am quite pleased with your submission and arousal as well as the goose bumps.�
Maud reached up and touched my face and then the base of her throat.
"You have permission to speak freely if you wish and nothing you tell me shall leave this room.�
"Thank you, Master."&nbsp; 
"Tell me what you want, Maud?"&nbsp; 
"I want you to make love to me, Master." 
"Is that all you have to say to me? I gave you permission to speak freely."&nbsp; I kissed her mouth again.
"I know about the top hat and the lilies; the whole story, Minerva told me. She said smiling.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
�Thank you for the plum wine. Gekkeikan is my favorite."
"You are welcome."
"Did you really quote Shakespeare when you confronted those bikers?" 
"Yes I did and I am told that you are quite the Shakespeare aficionado yourself."&nbsp; 
�I adore Shakespeare and before my crime against you and the Sanctorum I once owned all of his works. 
Fortunately I have access to Arthur's expansive Library and may still read him�
"And so you should; life without books and music would be a dismal life indeed."&nbsp; I replied.
�How your ex-wife left you for that cockroach I'll never understand; did she find you that boring? 
Arthur".... I put my hand over her mouth to stop her from talking. 
"We will talk later this evening my dear. Arthur being delayed a few days will give us plenty of time to talk; besides you will be sharing my bed tonight."
Stepping to one side to avoid the glass I removed my clothing and then got on top of the billiard table. 
"Get on your hands and knees. That's right just like that you silver vixen...now brace yourself. I told her slapping her ass just hard enough for it to sting and I made her yelp.&nbsp; "A slave needs to know her place; don't you agree?" 
"Yes Master."
Maud's vagina was dripping with desire in her arousal and her vaginal lips were pink and swollen waiting for the arrival of my cock to ravish her and ravish her I did. I was neither rough nor gentle with her and my need for her was very great. My manhood was rock hard from the anticipation of finally having her body if only for a few days. 
I would be seeing Maud often in the future however this might be my only opportunity to have her body. 
Minerva and Maud care a great deal about one another.&nbsp; Arthur and I planned on letting Maud visit on occasion when he was away on business or when they are together.&nbsp; On those occasions I will explore Maud's mind and intellect as a person.&nbsp; 
I pounded Maud with my rock hard penis as she braced herself for my vaginal assault. 
I continued pounding as my first orgasm washed over me bringing Maud to the brink of hers and then I pulled out. I started probing her clitoris with my fingers again.
"Do you want to come?"&nbsp; I asked, bringing her the brink again and then denying her my manhood or my fingers.
"Please, Master, I can't help myself, I'm so horny....&nbsp; please don't stop, let me come."
This obviously was not an act, Maud was begging for it and she was flushed, wet and ready.
The process in Maud's case removed much of her sexual inhibitions without altering her personality.... how interesting. 
It made it much easier for her to enjoy sex and for a slave with a male Master this was definitely a plus; Arthur hinted as much.&nbsp; 
If Maud's process were taken to the extreme it could leave her as a woman in a constant state of sexual arousal; a sex drone. Arthur and I agreed that the old fashion way was best because our ways and our methods are so similar. 
The process was a tool to heal and enhance; it is highly secret to prevent abuse. It requires the seating of the 50 to sanction its use and thus far Maud and Martha are the only recipients. 
What I knew for sure was that I was imprinted in Martha's mind as her benefactor, much like a baby duck imprints on its mother. Martha&#8217;s pain from the loss of our son as well as the abuse at the hands of Abzug was removed or greatly diminished.&nbsp; 
Martha&#8217;s sexual inhibitions were treated the same but not her fiery temper or her basic personality.&nbsp; I would have Martha the old fashioned way or not at all.&nbsp; I insisted upon this...the greater the challenge the sweeter the reward. 
I got off of the pool table and walked to the North wall and returned with an elegant cheery wood Queen Anne Chair.
Maud was sitting in the middle of the table watching me with a puzzled look on her face. 
I bowed to her with a flourish and I sang: "Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more, men were deceivers ever, one foot in sea, and one on shore, to one thing constant never.
Then sigh not so, but let them go, and be you blithe and bonny, converting all your sounds of woe into hey nonny nonny. Sing no more ditties, sing no moe, of dumps so dull and heavy; the fraud of men was ever so, since summer first was levy: Then sigh not so, &amp; c."&nbsp; 
I then offered her my hand and helped Maud off of the table to be rewarded by a beautiful smile and as she took my hand she curtseyed and said. "By my troth a good song, Master Balthazar.�
I sat on the chair and made Maud straddle me. I then kissed her mouth as I slid my revitalized cock into her dripping and welcoming vagina. 
"Now isn't this nice, Maud?&nbsp; Keep your feet on the floor and use your legs and feet; perfect that's it keep it up and take your time... enjoy.... you are in control for the moment."
I held her hips as Maud put her arms around my neck. She pumped up and down on my cock stimulating her sweet clitoris. Maud's eyes were closed and she leaned forward occasionally to open them and kiss my mouth. It was wonderful watching her pleasure herself like this; watching as her long silver hair bounced and swayed down her back; her ample breast close to be sucked and licked. 
Maud was rather quiet as she came; neither a moaner nor a screamer.&nbsp; I noticed an increase of her breathing as she inhaled and exhaled and that her face and neck was were flushed.&nbsp; I buried my hands in her hair and kissed Maud's mouth and face. 
Maud then leaned back with her arms still around my neck and she looked directly into my eyes; like she did when she was a Grand Mistress. 
�That you were once unkind befriends me now, and for that sorrow, which I then did feel, needs must I under my transgression bow, unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel..."&nbsp; 
"That was very well said my dear, very well said. 
I am still looking forward to talking to you; however that will have to wait until bedtime. I going to get dressed and meet with Martha. Please bring my duffle to my bedroom.� 
I was dressed and walking out the door when a thought occurred to me. 
"Do you have red lipstick?" I asked.
"Yes, do you want me to wear some this evening?" 
"Yes I do.&nbsp; Put your hair up again so that I may take it down.&nbsp; Until then, I would I were thy bird." I then waited for her lines.
"Sweet, so would I, yet I should kill thee with much cherishing. Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow, that I shall say good night till it be morrow." Maud replied, smiling as she replied as Juliet to my Romeo; this simple exchange assured me an exceptional blowjob later this evening.
I then walked to the East Gallery; a most unique room because of its stained glass windows. Arthur collects stained glass from Christian Churches or any unique stained glass windows from all over the world. These mentioned Churches were abandoned, remodeled or scheduled be demolished when Arthur purchased the stained glass for future generations to enjoy. 
Two of the walls from floor to ceiling have incorporated these mentioned windows and the room is breathtaking. He has also incorporated the wood, stone and marble from many of the sanctuaries to be made into tables, bookcases. 
Statues, chalices and crosses and such are displayed on pedestals, on tables or in the bookcases.... and oh yes, he collects church bells as well. 
Much more is stored in a climate-controlled warehouses and his collection is growing. I have sat in this room many times and it has a special feel to it; a feeling of goodness and this is Arthur's favorite room.
Martha was not waiting for me in the East Gallery having gone to the bathroom. I did not know that at the time and I went searching for her. I literally bumped into Martha as she came out of the bathroom in my room. 
I had to go myself when I caught her to keep her from falling. 
"Hello, Ms. Cardoso, I will be with you in a minute."&nbsp; I let go of her waist and then walked past her into the bathroom.&nbsp; 
Martha followed me saying �Mickey, I..." before I interrupted her.�Don't worry Martha; I will remember to put the toilet seat down." 
I managed to get a smile out of her while minimizing an awkward situation.
As I was buttoning up my fly I remembered that she always had to remind me about the toilet seat when we were first married.
I also remembered how much I loved her then and how I spoiled her... and how beautiful she was. 
I took my first good look at her while taking my time to washing hands. 
It is said that the clothing makes the man; the same can be said for the woman.&nbsp; Coincidently this was one of my marvelous Minerva's favorite sayings and is something that I always pay a great deal of attention too.&nbsp; How many married men or men with girlfriends fail to notice this often times to their ultimate demise. 
Martha was wearing a colorful maxi dress with a large floral pattern of various shades of red, orange and green. It had spaghetti straps and a fitted elastic bodice at the waist, and the loose and flattering jagged edged of the skirt moved with her as she turned or walked and it came down to her ankles to meet the straps of the open toe red sandals on her small and dainty feet.&nbsp; 
As God made her, Martha is a small and petite woman with much the same figure as Mandy.
At one time Martha had such beautiful long black hair; hair that was thick and soft, falling just to the middle of her back and I couldn&#8217;t keep my hands out of it; until she cut it short to spite me.&nbsp; 

At the present time it is an awful artificial bleached white blond and mid-back length and layered. 
The same terrible color as it was when she collapsed into my arms six months ago and now with the black roots growing out and showing.&nbsp; This would not do at all; I will not stand for it.&nbsp; Mandy would rehabilitate to its original black and then cut and shape Martha&#8217;s hair to my preferences.&nbsp; 
Being of Portuguese decent on her mother's side, Martha has dark onyx eyes and a clear blemish free very light olive complexion. Today Martha's face was makeup free; all in all Martha remains a beautiful woman with a screw&#8217;s temper to be tamed. 
I opened the bathroom door for her and we entered the bedroom. 
"Let&#8217;s go outside and we will talk while we are walking."&nbsp; I said offering her my arm and she took it but didn&#8217;t move.&nbsp; 
"By the way, you look lovely in that dress." 
"I want to thank you for everything that you have done for me, Mickey. I don't know where to begin. Everyone has been so kind to me, especially in the hospital.&nbsp; 
And then Martha put her head on my chest and hugged me and continued to talk which gave me the opportunity to touch her hair; as I suspected it was somewhat dry and over processed.&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't know those kinds of places existed.� She continued. 
And it must have been very expensive; especially being in another country and all; Sweden. 
I have never been on a private jet before, Mickey.�
"They exist for special people.&nbsp; I had the private jet chartered to ensure your privacy.� I replied. 
"This must sound terrible, Mickey, but I glad that he is dead. Arthur showed me the death certificate, a heart attack. Do you still think that I am special after all I put you through?"
"I'm no Saint, Martha. I share some of the blame and you are special. I should not have let your mother or aunts interfere the way that they did. I also should have kept a firmer hand with you and I know better now.� 
"I was wrong about you Mickey...my family was wrong about you especially my mother. I was wrong to blame you for Aaron's death and wrong to think that you were heartless and didn't care. My father was a weak man, Mickey; he was nothing like you; he could cry at the drop of a hat. That is why mother hated you. 
She thought of herself as the Matriarch over everybody except she couldn't control you like father. I thought that she was going to have a stroke on our wedding day when you drove your motorcycle right up the steps of the Basilica and then parked it by the main door in defiance of her and by doing so that day you put her into her place." Martha said laughing. 
"Yes, I enjoyed the look on your mother&#8217;s face and your father's as well; although it is a shame that she took it out on him."
Martha continued. �After our divorce that internet romance didn't work out and I moved home to be with my mother. 
I should have tried harder to reconcile with you but you were so angry and were never home. I hired a very good private detective to follow you, one of the best.�&nbsp; And then she started laughing again, I used to love to hear Martha laugh. 
"He quit!&nbsp; Mickey; you scared him off. How did you manage to sneak up on him and glue his car doors and windows shut while he was sitting in it?"
"I did it by being available for him to take photograph, keeps records etc. and by letting him think that he was accomplishing something even though I was watching him watching me. I let him think his hidden bugs and cameras were undetected and I allowed him to listen in on bogus telephone conversations. 
I observed that he always had a green Stanley thermos bottle in his sedan while on surveillance.&nbsp; He didn't drink out of the attached thermos cup but always in clean white paper cups that he kept in a plastic storage container in the backseat and that were the key."
"I don't understand?" 
"Perhaps I will tell you someday, Martha; please continue about your mother."
"I was under her thumb again; her fat daughter who couldn't give her grandchildren and she ever let me forget it.&nbsp; On the other hand she discouraged from losing weight, saying no man decent man would want me now that I was barren and used goods so what was the point; she wanted me fat like her.&nbsp; 
She also said that I was still beautiful in her eyes and to forget about men.&nbsp; Mama declared that it was God's will for me to be home again and I almost believed her; it would have been so easy to just give in. Mama said that she would take care of me. She had plans for my money and for what it could buy with father having died and she was lonely. When I lost weight and took up with Frank, she called me a whore and disowned me and I haven't talked to her since." 
"The past is the past, Martha.&nbsp; As much as we wish that we could change it we can't; we can only move forward. I will do what I can for you however there is something you must know. The man you knew as Mickey has gone away. I am not sure if he will ever return or will ever be there for you the same way that he once was. My name is Michael; my Ladies call me that and so shall you.&nbsp; Now, how about that walk? I could use the fresh air...............................
When I entered the bedroom Maud was curled up in a large overstuffed chair reading Antony &amp; Cleopatra. She had a small glass of her plum wine on the table beside her. Maud was wearing green silk pajamas and I was pleased to see that she had twisted her hair up in a nice bun The bun held in place with two ivory hair sticks; remove the sticks and her silver tresses would come tumbling down; this was a very nice touch to go along with the blood red lipstick on her soon to be cock sucking lips. 
Getting up she put her book down and then assumed the position at my feet. �I&#8217;m going to shower first, my dear. Turn back the covers on the bed and get some extra pillows. When I get out of the shower I expect to see you as you are now. I then took a quick shower and returned naked to find my requests fulfilled and Maud in the position on the floor.&nbsp; 
�Heel my dear.�&nbsp; Maud the former Grand Mistress was now kneeling nicely before me. �How many Masters or Grand Masters made use of you before Arthur brought you here?�&nbsp; �Three Masters and a Grand Mistress; I was with Grand Mistress Pamela the shortest and she was the last until Arthur. She kept me on a leash the entire time... May I speak in confidence?&nbsp; I know that you allow your Ladies this privilege.�
�You may.� I answered and Maud continued.&nbsp; �None of the three Masters had sexual relations with me of any kind. Do you want to know who they were?�&nbsp; �That won&#8217;t be necessary.� I answered. 
�All three Masters kept me on a strict diet and exercise program because they wanted to curry favor with Arthur. I was kept naked most of the time and when I wasn&#8217;t exercising I was given the most menial of tasks to perform; I was a slave to their slaves.&nbsp; 
Master Brogan�I sorry it just slipped out. �It is alright Maud, please continue.�&nbsp; �Master Brogan dressed me like a slut, a cheap whore, heavy makeup and all and then made me spend part of my days running errands for him and making purchases that he really didn&#8217;t want. He made me return them the next day and then purchase different ones. I know that cheap slutty look turned him on, aroused him and yet he never touched me. In for a dime in for a dollar as they say; he makes both his slaves dress like sluts and they are pretty young girls; what a waste.&#8217; 
�You would never know this seeing how good they look at a Gathering.�&nbsp; I added.�&nbsp; �Yes I know.� She agreed.
�I was Grand Mistress Pamela&#8217;s doggy and I was made to bark and yip. I was made eat like a dog; too sit up and beg like a dog.&nbsp; She even made me defecate and urinate outside in the grass and I was never allowed to stand in her presence.� 
I touched her face and said. �I get the picture but keep in mind things could have been worse. You know Arthur is going to purchase you and you have that to look forward too. You may put those things out of your mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
�Yes, I know he explained everything to me.� She said.&nbsp; 
�Then you also know that you will be seeing Minerva soon; another thing to look forward to and you look lovely this evening.�&nbsp; 
�Thank you, Master Michael�.would you have purchased me if Arthur hadn&#8217;t?�
�That depends?� I answered. �What does it depend on?� She asked.
�Am I your first choice or second choice, Maud?� 
�I have no choice, Master but you already know that; however I&#8217;m content to be here with Arthur.�&nbsp; 
�Tonight you are my first choice, Maud and you will be mine until Arthur returns.�&nbsp; 
�Would you still have purchased me if Arthur hadn&#8217;t?� She asked.&nbsp; �You know the answer, Maud. �
�I want to suck on your cock now, Michael?�&nbsp; 
�You are awful bold, slave; addressing me by my first name.� Maud ignored the admonishment.&nbsp; 
�I need the practice; I&#8217;ve never sucked on cock before and I don&#8217;t want Arthur to know.� 
�Is that why you asked to speak to me in confidence; you sucked me in you silver fox.�&nbsp; 
�Yes, Michael and now I want to suck you off. Will you teach me to suck cock?�&nbsp; 
�Goodness gracious! Such crude words from such a dignified Lady; stand up and turn around.�&nbsp; I took the sticks out of her hair watching her tresses fall down her back like a silver water waterfall. Maud&#8217;s silver hair felt wonderful in my hands as I arranged it around her shoulders and back.&nbsp; I then put my hands on her shoulders and turned her to face me; Maud was smiling.&nbsp; 
�Impertinent slave� I pulled her close and kissed her mouth. �You have a saucy mouth much like Minerva&#8217;s. You do not have permission to speak. I have other plans for your mouth and tongue. Heel and start with your tongue. Be sure to look into my eyes or Arthur&#8217;s eyes when you are licking unless you are told otherwise.�
�Yes that's right.&nbsp; Lick the entire shaft................Marvelous.&nbsp; Take your little tongue and lick the entire circumference of the tip.
Very good that feels wonderful.&nbsp; Alternate between the two: the shaft the tip� the shaft the tip; in a circle with your tongue�in a circle with your tongue� keep licking.&nbsp; As you can see I am shaved down below: a small concession to my Ladies. It makes oral sex more enjoyable for them and for me�.ah yes�mm... Very nice, Maud you are doing fine�mm, pretend that your tongue is a butterflies wings fluttering from flower to flower. Flutter your tongue on the tip�good you are reading my mind; in a circle, on the tip, on the shaft, good you are developing your own technique already; you have me throbbing and pulsating and I am holding back my orgasm to prolong the sensual pleasure�mm�ah God, blue eyes�back off your teasing and lick the clear pre-cum off of my penis� keep looking at me�. now take a break.�

All the while that Maud was licking I had my hands in her hair to keep it out of her face.&nbsp; �At this rate you will soon instinctively know when your Master is about to come; the pulsating and throbbing cock and the pre-cum; learn the taste and then back off.
If I wanted to come right now I would use your beautiful hair like a horses reins and then immediately ejaculate into your mouth.
Many Masters would come on your face: I am not one of them unless that is your preference and only to indulge you, to spice things up so to speak. 
I am going to pull out slightly just before I do come so that you do not gag or choke; again, many Masters enjoy making their slaves gag; I&#8217;ll be damned if I know why though.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maud nodded her head and smiled.

Most men also like to have their balls licked and sucked on�very nice�keep licking�lick the inside of my legs where my balls hang; ah, yes nice, very nice; that&#8217;s why I showered first: simple common courtesy and good bed manners�.take my balls in your mouth and suck and be sure to be careful with your teeth�good�.suck and look up at me blue eyes� watch your teeth...mm�. yes, yes �ah.. Nice, but enough of that for now; I want you to concentrate on my cock�blue eyes; stand up.�

I took her face in my hands and looked into her eyes as would a lover or as would a Master of my ilk. 
�You have beautiful eyes Maud. Until I arrived I expected to see brown hair. Not the natural silver I see now. Your hair is like fine spun pure silver and yet as soft and silky as eider down. 

Your eyes are so cornflower blue as to shame the most precious and rare blue sapphires from Burma; eyes so blue as to make Shakespeare sputter and stammer for lack of words.&nbsp; When we alone together I shall call you Blue-eyes and that shall be our secret� Please go get my leather jacket from the closet.� 

When she returned, I removed a white envelope from the inside pocket. I then took her hand and led her to the large
Oval floor to ceiling mirror on the far wall and I had her stand in front of it while I stood behind her. This mentioned mirror was bordered with stained glass and set in a black wrought iron frame. 

�I brought you something else, Blue-eyes. Lift your hair off the back of your neck and hold it there on top of your head.

I removed platinum serpentine choker with a four- caret stone that was set in a pendant and put it around her neck. 
It looked lovely there; a perfect fit with the flawless sapphire nestled nicely against the base of her throat.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
�As a Grand Mistress your symbol was a gold tiara with an amethyst stone; your color was the purple of your cloth. 
The tiara is a symbol that is common to all Grand Mistresses but unique to none. 

This blue Burmese Sapphire is set in platinum; this pendant is of one of a kind as are you. You are far more precious because of your intellect; your soul, even more precious to a Master who knows your true worth.&nbsp; Your color is now silver; your cloth is your glorious naked body soft and warm in your Master&#8217;s arms. 
See how the stone glows and sparkles now that it is warmed by your body heat and infused with your bright aura.&nbsp; 

She was at a loss for words and I saw her bottom lip quiver as she watched us in the mirror.

I could also see that she was starting to cry so I reached around and wiped away that first tear from her eye.&nbsp; 
Maud turned, wrapped her arms around my neck and kissed my cheek and whispered. 

�Thank you Master. I&#8217;ve never received such an intimate gift�nor have I had a man talk to me like this before. I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m�...� 
Then she kissed my mouth and put her head on my chest and started crying softly; and yet she was smiling. 
Maud; imperious Maud lost for words; My Blue-eyes, soft and warm in my arms�ah the epiphanies of being a Master. 

I held her a few moments knowing that she was somewhat embarrassed and then I gave her bottom a playful slap and said. �Remember your cloth and colors Blue-eyes and then please pour me half a glass of wine.�

I let go of her and then got into bed while sitting up and leaning back against the large pile of pillows in front of the headboard. 
Maud undressed, filled her wine glass � full and took a sip leaving the volume � full as I requested before handing it to me.
She then got into bed with me and lay down with her head in my lap. I pushed her hair to one side and lightly caressed her cheek while slowly savoring the wine.

�Michael, may I finish now?�&nbsp; 
�Of course you may; show me what you have learned.�&nbsp; I answered, draining the small glass and dropping it carefully to the carpet.&nbsp; She rolled over onto her stomach and started kissing my manhood while sneaking in little licks here and there. 
Kissing and licking my balls and the insides of my legs and crotch, teasing and probing. 
As before Maud licked the tip and shaft in a circular motion alternating soft, hard and fluttering her tongue on the tip. 

Getting up on her hands and knees Maud kissed my neck and chest and worked her way down licking here and there while continuing to kiss until she reached my cock. 
She took it into her mouth and started sucking, moving her head up and down the shaft.

I grabbed her hair and pulled her off.&nbsp; �Watch your teeth Blue-eyes.� I advised her while lightly cuffing her head. 
�Many Masters would beat you if you irritate their Manhood with your teeth.&nbsp; 
Not that you just did; however that if very important to mind your teeth.
School is in session and this is your final exam to graduate. 
If you pass I will make breakfast tomorrow morning.
Besides, it has been a long day and I want to get some sleep.� 

I lay down on my side after fixing the pillows to get comfortable. 
Maud slid down squirming to get to into comfortable position and was very careful with her teeth while she started sucking and doing a totally marvelous. 

I played with her hair while she licked and sucked, pulling back in into a ponytail, twisting it up into a bun and then letting it down again to caress her shoulders and back repeating my hair play and in no hurry to come.&nbsp; 

When my orgasm finally washed over me I pulled out partially as not to choke or gag her. 
My semen felt white hot as I hosed the inside of her mouth with my molten cum. 

To her credit she swallowed most of it getting a smidge on her chin.
Maud then sat up smiling at me and her eyes were shining as she was licking her lips. 
I wiped the spilled semen from Maud&#8217;s chin with my fingers and then she licked and kissed each finger clean. 
I then held her hair away from her face while she cleaned my cock and balls thoroughly with her mouth and tongue. 

�There is mouthwash in the bathroom for you if want to use it. Afterwards you may stay up read if you wish 
Goodnight Blue-eyes; you passed.� I then stretched out in the bed, closed my eyes and went immediately to sleep.

I woke up the next morning with Maud snuggled up close to me sound asleep. 
I noticed that she had fixed her hair in a simple three strand side braid. 
Sarah does this with her long brown hair to keep me from lying on it while we are sleeping and accidently pulling it when she or I move.&nbsp; 

Looking at Maud sleeping beside me reminded me that I have often contemplated that although I am a Master with four slaves; I was also like a husband with four wives to keep happy. 
Totally obedient wives to be sure, but all vying for my attention to various degrees; especially Minerva and Sarah. 
Discipline is paramount to maintain harmony in such a household; too cement their joint cooperation with one another. 
Discipline is followed closely by submission, loyalty, kindness, affection and yes; even loves.&nbsp; 

Now that I have seen her and talked with her, would Martha been able to accept that fact I live with four women? 
Or that they love me?&nbsp; Could Martha with her temper and acid tongue be able to get along in our household? 

Minerva can easily handle Martha if it came to a confrontation.&nbsp; 
Katherine is busy studying for her PhD and is living off campus in her own house, a house that is in walking distance to her classes. 
She will not be around much for the next four years and will hardly have to deal with Martha.&nbsp; 

Katherine loves this arrangement. I spend two days with her every three weeks or so. 
We pretend that she is my mistress�.the other kind, a kept woman.&nbsp; 
We have the entire house to ourselves to play chess and do whatever we like
This is a concession and a reward for her studying hard to become a doctor; Katherine has a brilliant analytical mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

My little peach, Mandy has her business to attend to during the day, taking weekends off. 
It will pretty much fall on Sarah and Minerva to deal with Martha when I am away on business; my own or that of the Sanctorum. 

I was just lying there contemplating these things along with my promise to cook breakfast when there was a loud knock on the door.&nbsp; I sat up getting ready to answer it and heard her call from behind the closed door.&nbsp; 

�Michael, it&#8217;s me, Martha. May I come in?&nbsp; I made you breakfast.�&nbsp; 

The knock woke Maud up as well. She sat up and wrapped the sheet in front to cover her ample bosom. 
She was smiling while giving me a knowing look and was not at all embarrassed.&nbsp; 
I was thinking; �I am sure I told Martha that would be making breakfast for the three of us.� 

To late�Martha opened the door and walked in on us with a tray in hand, breakfast for two. 
When she saw Maud sitting in bed next to me� well, to say that she was surprised was an understatement. 

Martha was told that Maud was Arthur&#8217;s Personal Secretary and live-in house sitter/caretaker; after that there was no telling what Martha assumed or thought about the arrangement; and then she saw Maud in bed with me who changed her perception again.

Maud got out of bed and assumed the stern commanding persona that she used as a Grand Mistress; or should I say naked Grand Mistress Persona.&nbsp; 

She took the tray from a totally flabbergasted and now tongue-tied Martha. 
�Thank you, Ms. Cardoso. It was very thoughtful for you to make breakfast for the two of us. 
Michael was just telling me that he was taking us out for lunch later; I would attend but I have no time in my busy schedule. 
So if you will please excuse us.� 

Maud said as she put the tray on the bed. �He will attend to you later.� 
Intimidated and confused Martha left as Maud followed and ushered her out and locking the door before she turned to me, smiling. 

�Do you take cream or sugar with your coffee, Master?�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

�That was mean, Blue-eyes!�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

�What was mean, Michael?� 

�Pulling the Grand Mistress on Martha, intimidating her; and you did it so well.�&nbsp; 

�She had it coming for the way she treated you.� Maud replied, pouring my coffee and taking the covers off of the dishes. 
�You&#8217;ll have plenty of time to spend with her when you get home; besides I don&#8217;t want to share you with her until then.�

�If you didn&#8217;t want to share why did you tell her that I was taking her out to lunch and you couldn&#8217;t attend?� 
Maud ignored the question; it was like dealing with an older version of Minerva. 

�This looks delicious!� She exclaimed taking a bite of omelet, chewing and swallowing. 
�It has hot and sweet peppers, Genoa Salami, provolone cheese minced black olives and it is simply delicious.� 

�So� I&#8217;m taking Martha out to lunch am I?�&nbsp; 

To which she replied. �Yes, it is the least that you can do to thank her for the delicious breakfast that she made for us; although taking us out to dinner would be better. Besides, it makes you look good in her eyes.�

�Did you just say us, Blue-eyes?�&nbsp; 

�Yes Michael, us, as in Ms. Cardoso and me.&nbsp; I just discovered some free time in my busy schedule.�&nbsp; 

�You realize that the breakfast was for Martha and me?� 

�Well too late now.� She answered, taking a bite of toast. �Your omelet is getting cold, Master.�&nbsp; 
 
I just sighed and picked up my fork.&nbsp; I had been outmaneuvered.&nbsp; 

�Fine, be so kind as to make dinner reservations for three.�&nbsp;&nbsp; 

�Of course I will Mr. Buckley that is my job as a personal secretary����

I spent part of that day just talking with Martha; about our failed marriage and the death of our son; Martha broke down and cried and I held her hand.&nbsp; We talked of things that went unsaid but should have been. We cleared the air about many things, many misunderstandings and laughed about many others and it was good for both of us. Then I took a nap alone until it was almost time for dinner.

I usually travel light and only brought two changes of clothing this time.
Maud was aware of this having made the reservations and dressed accordingly to the establishment that she selected; a well known landmark oyster bar, casual but expensive. Because of this among others events made dinner and interesting affair.

I was wearing my scuffed engineer boots, blue jeans, a white silk shirt and my old friend (my beat up A-2 leather jacket). 
While Maud was dressed in snug fitting blue jeans, white sneakers and a short jean jacket over her white silk blouse.
She wasn&#8217;t wearing any makeup that evening except for the red lipstick and her silver hair was unbound and loose about her shoulders and it flowed nicely down her back; she was also wearing her blue sapphire. 

Martha was deliberately left out of the loop about the correct time and proper attire and met us downstairs at the last minute dressed to the nines in a revealing black dress better situated for a formal dining establishment. 
She was wearing a beautiful pearl necklace with matching earrings; a gift from Arthur; Her makeup done to perfection. 
Martha&#8217;s hair was pinned up in a curly French twist with Maud&#8217;s help and despite the terrible bleached blond hair Martha looked nice.&nbsp; 

Martha wasn&#8217;t happy when she found out where we were going and she was glaring daggers at Maud. 
Although in the end she was a good sport about it and made the best of it.&nbsp; 
We drove to the oyster bar in Arthur&#8217;s classic 1960 Rolls-Royce Phantom V White Limousine. 
Maud sat in the back seat and Martha sat in the front with me while I drove. When we arrived I helped each lady out and then I walked into the restaurant with one on each arm.&nbsp; 
 
When we got there the only table available was a raised one with tall barstools right next the kitchen; not good. 
In a better location Maud and I alone could have managed but difficult it was for Martha considering that she was dressed so formally.&nbsp; 

There were two young couples, friends celebrating a first wedding anniversary in a prime corner away from the bar.&nbsp; 
I sent a drink over to their table and one of the men came over to thank me.&nbsp; I took him to one sided to talk with him; he in turn went back to his table to talk with his friends. With the help of one of our first United States Diplomats, Benjamin Franklin a temporary treaty was reached and we switched tables.

After we were seated at the new table Martha asked, �What did you say to him, Michael? 
I&#8217;m complaining but how did you convince them to switch tables?�

�I let Benjamin Franklin do the talking.�&nbsp; I replied, taking a sip of my India Pale Ale.&nbsp; 

�I don&#8217;t understand?� She said looking puzzled and putting her menu down.&nbsp; 

�How many did it take?� Maud asked, smiling.

�Eight, I told them to consider it an anniversary gift.� I replied to Maud&#8217;s question.

�So you bribed them?� Maud emphatically stated while looking at Martha as if she had just scored a point. 

�Essentially, yes.� I said laughing with Maud joining with me. Martha looked at us thoughtfully and sipped her diet Pepsi.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Somehow I got the feeling that Martha was being deliberately obtuse because she timed her next question as Maud was taking a sip of her ale.

�That&#8217;s a lot of money Mickey!&nbsp; Can you afford it?�

That bitter ale went down the wrong way because Maud started coughing and turning red. 
She had to put her napkin over her face to stop the ale coming out of her nose. 
I stood up to pat her on the back but she waved me off and rushed to the Ladies Room.&nbsp; 
The whole time Martha sat quietly while innocently studying her menu. 

I glared at her thinking, �tit for tat ladies� and then sternly said, �Well Martha?� �What do you have to say for yourself?� 

�Oh, I forgot, Michael I&#8217;m not supposed to call you Mickey anymore.� She replied, holding the menu in front of her face so that I could not see her mischievous smile; or should I say passive aggressive smile?

When Maud returned to the table her face was still flushed and pink and red her lipstick was freshly applied and now she was staring knives at Martha.

�I meant the other thing, Martha.�

She folded her menu and put it down. �Oh that.&nbsp; I think that I shall have the steamed Maine Lobster.� 
Martha replied sweetly returning Maud&#8217;s stare.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I had to bite my tongue and sipped my ale to keep from laughing and then turning to Maud I asked �Are you alright.�

�I&#8217;m fine; what are you having.� Maud asked, still glaring at Martha. 

�I&#8217;m having dozens and dozens of raw oysters on the half shell with malt vinegar and black pepper and then more with Tabasco sauce.� 

�That sounds fabulous, Michael!� Maud exclaimed �We can share��������..�&nbsp; 

I must say that those fresh oysters were fabulous!&nbsp; Maud slid her chair quite close to mine while we ate and ate; we lost track of how many dozen oysters that we ordered until the bill came. I tipped the waitress a ten spot for each fresh dozen that she brought to keep them coming fresh and cold on ice. Martha ate her lobster and then decided to try a raw oyster; she made a terrible face 
as she quickly swallowed it.&nbsp; She then ordered a jumbo shrimp cocktail and a Bloody Mary, this being her favorite mixed drink. 

I received many discrete intimate touches from Maud, much to Martha&#8217;s displeasure; when we went up to pay the bill, the cashier, a pretty young redhead in her twenties slipped me her cell phone number and her hand lingered on mine much to both their displeasure�as I said, dinner was an interesting affair with a twist; I got an opportunity to try out a new technique.

There was an idiot, a rather large muscle bound Hulk Hogan lookalike in his twenties sitting with a friend; this mentioned friend his single member fan club; this fawning fan no doubt was an aspiring body builder himself although he was of average build and they were sitting at the table next to us. 

The body builder was the type of idiot that lives in the gym and has contempt for anyone who doesn&#8217;t. 
The type that dresses in tight sleeveless tee shirts regardless of the weather and probably stars in porn films for a living. 
He was loud, obnoxious, ignorant and opinionated�did I leave anything out?&nbsp; They were there to drink and he kept harassing their waitress, our waitress about the slow service; as I said our service was great. 

On top of that he grabbed the waitress&#8217;s ass a few times making the manager come over to talk with him.
He was also leering at Martha and made a comment about the big-shot shrimp; me, throwing money around.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
In addition to all of this he was telling vulgar dumb blond jokes while he leered at Martha, licking his lips to which his fan club groupie laughed hysterically.

I got up to talk to him and asked him politely to tone it down; he didn&#8217;t bother getting up but shifted his chair instead so that his back was to me and he told another vulgar joke.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

�Are you a Star Trek Fan?� I asked. 

�What does that have to do with anything, shrimp?�&nbsp; He asked laughing, his friend as well; to which I matter of factually replied.

�Because the logo on your muscle shirt is a Starfleet com-badge� I answered.&nbsp; When he glanced at the logo I reached forward and executed the classic Vulcan nerve pinch rendering him unconscious and he slumped forward in his chair; thank God it worked because I forgot my taser in the limo.&nbsp; 

I looked at his groupie friend and smiled.&nbsp; �That was the Vulcan nerve pinch.� I lied while raising my hand like Mr. Spock, palm forward with the fingers spread between my middle and ring finger with my thumb extended and said, �Live long and prosper.�

By then the manager and a patron who was an off duty cop arrived. After questioning me and several of the patrons the Officer quietly ejected them both of them from the premises without further incident; it was determined that the loud mouth had passed out from too much drink which left me nicely off the hook.&nbsp; 
Although I did hear someone shout as they were escorting them out, �Beam them out, Scotty!�&nbsp;&nbsp; 

When I finally got back to my table Martha leaned over, kissed cheek and said. �There is no such thing as the Vulcan nerve pinch; what did you do to him?�&nbsp; 

�I rendered him temporarily unconscious.� I replied, picking up an oyster and eating it.

�We know that but how did you do it?� Martha asked. �I&#8217;ll tell you at another time, Martha.�&nbsp; 
�Then will you tell me how you trapped my private investigator in his car?� Martha asked.

�I never heard about this one; what private investigator?� Maud chimed in. 

�Start from the beginning and tell Maud what happened and I will tell the rest of the story. I said to Martha while I continued eating those fabulous oysters, which she did, ending with that he quit and wouldn&#8217;t return her telephone calls or her retainer. 
I then ordered ale for me, a Pepsi for Martha and ice water for Maud since she would be driving. 

�As I said, Martha, the key was the disposable paper cups. I bugged his vehicle by putting a passive homing device in his sedan. 
It was a simple matter to find out then where he lived and who he was. When he was a home at night sleeping with his wife I disabled his car alarm and replaced one paper cup with identical cup but special one.� 

�Then you coated his cup with some drug or chemical to knock him out, right?� Maud asked and to which I replied, �Exactly.�

�He spent a lot of time in his car and he always sat in it while drinking his coffee; he was a creature of habit.&nbsp; 
After he was unconscious I removed the treated cup and poured fresh coffee from his thermos bottle into one I brought so that the cup count was the same. I also refilled his thermos to the proper level and then left him a little gift. 

Next I glued his car doors, windows and trunk shut with a chalking gun containing a tube of industrial strength quick drying epoxy followed by disabling his car from starting after removing his cell phone and then making an anonymous 911 telephone call to the Sheriff and leaving the cell phone line open for them to trace followed by dropping his phone in a mail box on the way to the airport.
I imagine that he had one hell of a time explaining to the authorities how he ended up that way or why he couldn&#8217;t stop sneezing. 
&nbsp; 
I was out of the country by then with an alibi in the event that I was questioned, which I wasn&#8217;t; I went as far as to send him a postcard from the Virgin Islands postmarked two days after my official departure date; the next day he checked the airlines, my contact there notified me that they confirmed my departure to him as to days prior. I immediately called your private dick on a prepaid untraceable track-phone advising him politely to drop the case and to check his laptop for an e-mail with an attachment titled �sleep tight.�&nbsp; 

�What kind of present?� They both asked together and then looked at one another and smiled, inferring a truce of sorts followed by Martha asking �What was the e-mail?�

�A can of Planters Peanuts� I answered. �The e-mail attachment was a digital photo taken with his camera of him and his wife sound asleep in their bedroom; I kept the camera it was a very good one. 
If he were to trace the source of the e-mail, or even the CIA were to trace it the result would be the same; from a server in Nigeria.�

�Why a can peanuts?� they both asked again at the same time.&nbsp; 

�The can was a facade, Ladies. It did not contain any peanuts. 
Inside was one of those novelty cloth covered coil springs that resemble a snake; open the can and it pops out; corny but effective....�&nbsp; They were both looking intently at me, waiting�.�especially because of the concentrated sneezing powder that was released in seconds from a small high pressure continuous aerosol dispenser in the bottom of the can after the snake popped out��������..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Martha and I sat in the backseat of the limo while Maud drove. When we arrived at Arthur&#8217;s estate I left them and telephoned home and spoke with Minerva, Sarah and the Mandy.&nbsp; 
I told Mandy about Martha&#8217;s hair and Mandy made a special appointment for her. 
Afterwards I ran a diagnostic on Arthur&#8217;s security system, installed some new software and then telephoned the security checkpoints for them to reset their systems.&nbsp; 

Martha was waiting for me in my room and was dressed as she was at dinner. She got up from the bed and walked over to me touching my face and saying, �I don&#8217;t know how you did it but thank you�do you still find me attractive?� 

�You are a beautiful woman, Martha.� I replied, putting my hands on her shoulders while looking into her eyes. 
�That being said I live with three beautiful women now; we have an arrangement and I consider them family.�

�Yes, I know; they were very kind to me and they were so brave�.but you said three, did someone move out?�

�Katherine is attending U. B. Medical School and studying to be a doctor; she lives in a house close to campus.&nbsp; 
Minerva, Sarah and Mandy are there; each with their own rooms and they are my companions and lovers.�

�It seems that you have many lovers, Michael, including Ms. McCabe�.you said I am still beautiful, Michael. 
Am I going to be one? Are you ever going to make love to me again?� 

�My current Ladies are quite submissive and I am sure that you have noticed that even Maud defers to me.� 
I said, matter-of-factly while taking my hands off her shoulders, taking a step back and folding my arms.
�Only obedient women interest me now�.take your hair down, Martha.� I said in a quiet but commanding tone.

Despite the surprised look on her face, Martha took the hairpins out of her hair and shook her head. 
�That&#8217;s a start.� I told her, �I don&#8217;t approve of your current hair color or the layers; it makes you look trashy and you have never been that way.� I announced taking a lock of her hair between my thumb and fore finger and tugging and saying �Hence the idiot at the oyster bar leering and making jokes; that was Abzug&#8217;s preference trashy no doubt to humiliate you. � 
Martha just nodded, her eyes getting big.
This trashy bleached blond color does not suit you. I prefer your God given natural hair color; black. 
�This bleached blond debacle will soon will be rectified; with or without your consent.� And I tugged harder. 
�You will be a Lady again and you will make me proud.�

Martha opened her mouth to speak and I put my hand over it while shaking my head.
�There is an old saying my dear, �Women and children should be seen and not heard.
When we were married you were my equal; I&#8217;ve come to believe that was our demise. 
It has no place in your current position as my legal ward; do you understand?�

She nodded her head for yes and then I walked away from her and lay down on the bed making her turn and she looked surprised, a puzzled look on her pretty face. 
�You will take of my boots off and then you will remove your pearl necklace and earrings.
You will then draw a hot bath for me and call me when the tub is full�that is of course if you wish to be my future lover.�

I lay there with my eyes closed until she came to get me and so far she was obedient�good.
Once there I undressed and got into the tub sliding down to submerge my head to wet my hair and then I came back up reached for the shampoo and handed it to her. 

As she tried to take it from me I grabbed her and pulled her into the tub causing her to shriek as I pulled her close.&nbsp; 
When we were married she would never shower with me and Martha is a tiny little thing much like my Mandy; I held her effortlessly as she struggled to get free.&nbsp; 

�Michael what are you doing, my dress! You can&#8217;t�� I kissed her mouth to silence her and she tasted wonderful.
When I kissed her I could feel her relax and melt into me. �I don&#8217;t believe that I kissed yet, Martha. Don&#8217;t worry about your dress I will buy you another.�

�May I at least take off my shoes?� She asked 

�You may, mi Ni�a�start by shampooing my hair and remember, seen and not heard�������
