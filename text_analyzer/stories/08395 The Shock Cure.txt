THE SHOCK CURE

August, 1969

Ms. Scalpel massaged Abel's rock hard cock as she smiled at him impishly. "So all your friends went up to this concert, but you came to see me here...Abelard?"
�
"Yeah, that's my full name." Abel said, squirming against the cuffs that held his wrists to the ceiling hook. "But I go by Abel."
�
Ms. Scalpel snorted. She was half Asian-half black, and very curvy, and she ran her long burgundy nails up and down Abel's penis..he was still in shock from the vicious whipping she'd given him. "You know that Abelard, Peter Abelard that is, was a 9th century French philosopher who was castrated because of his relationship with a woman called Heloise...and of course if you want to go by Abel for short, there's an even earlier story..."
�
Abel nodded wearily. He had suffered through a childhood of being asked if he had a violent brother called Cain. Maybe he should have gone to the Woodstock festival at Max Yasgur's farm. Kenny and Elmo had begged him to join them, but Abel never missed his weekly sessions with the various dominant ladies of the New Haven Conservatory of Pain...perhaps a strange activity for a Yale sophomore...and quite a drain on his trust fund.
�
This was his first session with Ms. Scalpel,though...she was barely five foot three, but had big full boobs poking out of a snug cotton top, and faded tight jeans with lots of holes...she didn't wear the usual leather outfit, but was incredibly hot anyway.
�
Ms. Persimmons, who usually played out a Governess fantasy with Abel had the flu today, and Abel was starting to think he preferred Ms. Scalpel!
�
Ms. Scalpel ran her long nails under Abel's swelling testes, and gave him a wink. "So, Abelard, you think you'd get castrated for the right woman?" Before he could respond she whacked his scrotum with her palm and he yelped loudly, and tears ran down his cheeks.
�
Then she laughed loudly. "Maybe not."

Early 1976

�Now what is it you want me to do?� asked Verdine, giggling. Abel sighed, smiling at his gorgeous new wife, All that red hair piled on her head, her big boobs spilling out of the black frilly top. He&#8217;d gotten her to tie his hands to the bedposts, and she was sitting next to him, now, looking curious.

�You want me to give you a hand job, I know you like that, right?� Verdine asked curiously. She took a long red nail and stroked the side of Abel&#8217;s penis lightly, and his dick hardened and swelled from the slight attention.

�Yeah, that&#8217;s right, Verdie, but usually, when I beg you to finish me off, you do, and what I want you to do now, is do all the fun teasing, but don&#8217;t let me squirt�or at least not for a while. Make me beg for it, and then keep saying no.�

Verdine pouted, and her eyes grew big. �Really?� she asked. �That sounds mean.� But she stuck her tongue out at her young husband and began running her fingers up and down his tumescent shaft. �Like this?� she giggled, and she rubbed Abel&#8217;s penis faster and faster and then pulled her hand away all of a sudden just as he gasped.

1977
�
"Stop...time to stop, Abel." Verdine said, pushing him back. Abe shook his head, frustrated. It was hard�enough necking with a clothed girl while he was naked and his hands were tied...and she was�stroking his hard cock...they'd been kissing for HOURS. But now they were to stop...again?
�
"Why do we have to stop?" Abel asked with true injury in his eyes. "What the hell's going on?"
�
Verdine slapped Abel's cheek lightly. "Stop it. I don't like profanity. We're done here. I have a get together with my friend Mike...and you promised to clean the bathroom."
�
Abel sighed, staring at his beautiful wife. She was wearing a powder blue bra and jeans, and�her cleavage was just the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen...and he just wanted his hands free to play with her boobs, and maybe get her clothes off and fuck her some. He loved the way Verdine teased him, but he was her husband, not some high school kid.
�
Verdine�chuckled, and rubbed her full breasts against Abel's narrow chest. "I know you're rarin' to go,�Big boy...but Momma's got an appointment elsewhere, and you can just take a cold shower and then scrub the bathroom, vacuum the house and �clip the hedges...get that energy out productively."
�
Verdine reached down and gently stroked Abel's hardening penis, and put her tongue�in his ear as he squirmed yet again. "And you better not play with your wee-wee while I'm gone. That's for me...and you won't get to�fuck me if you're going to expend your spermish energy elsewhere."
�
Against his will, Abel laughed. She was so innocent, and used the most illiterate expressions. And of course he didn't�WANT to jerk off, but he hated being left horny.
�
"What are you�doing with Mike? I don't understand why you have so many male friends" Abel whined. Every old boyfriend, every "platonic" guy she ever hung out with, even the grocery clerks at the market,� Verdine had to be best friends with all of them. She'd told him more than once that women weren't as interesting as men were, and that might be so but...
�
"I gotta go, and don't worry about me and Mike...we are kind of friends with benefits. But you're let off of the chores, honey...I can't trust you to let your hands loose!" Verdine said after a moment of careful thought. She jumped up and pulled on her clothes as Abel gaped.
�
"You can�just lie here and think of Mike and I, and rub your dick on the pillow cushions...I'll be�back later!"
�
Abel's mind goggled as he struggled with the bonds. What the hell was friends with benefits?


1984

Abel came in just as Verdine had put the children to bed. Abe, Jr. and Macel both had the flu, and it was worrying her, but she was also rather annoyed as she saw her abashed husband. �So, did you make a nasty in the bathroom today, just because I deprived you?� Verdine snapped. �I&#8217;ll know, and you&#8217;re going to pay for it. Go in the bedroom and take off your clothes.�

Abel gulped, and obeyed her . When Verdine came in a moment later, Abel&#8217;s business suit was folded up on his briefcase, and he was kneeling naked on the bedroom floor, looking a little bit terrified.

But he did look adoringly up at his wife, hoping she would be more merciful with him. Teasing and denial had been so much fun in their early nuptials, and it had gotten more exciting when Verdine had begun limiting Abel&#8217;s orgasms&#8212;teasing his cock for an hour every night without letting him cum for a week, and then wild, WILD lovemaking on Friday�

And then of course she&#8217;d learned that Abel&#8217;s tongue was far superior in inducing pleasure than his penis, and after a while, she&#8217;d only allowed him to use his penis for fertilization purposes�five kids so far�and she&#8217;d let Abel masturbate on her shoes every few weeks, after making him&nbsp; �hold it in� between teasing sessions.

But with the increased amount of time Verdine spent with the children, the less she had to tend to her husband&#8217;s needs, though of course she still required his head between her legs&nbsp; seven nights a week�the teasing had gone by the wayside, for a bit, and she&#8217;d begun punishing him when he begged for it�she could swing a razor strop with the best of them!

But then Abel had begun masturbating at work, to take the tension out, and he seemed less interested in servicing Verdine, and this enraged her. So now she was checking his testicle load every night, to see if he&#8217;d been �unfaithful� during the day�how dare he!

Tonight was no exception. Verdine snapped her fingers and Abel jumped up on the bed, and she ran her fingers experimentally around his cock and balls, and they seemed to swell, but the thought that he was even tempted to look at his secretary and fantasize about the little slut just enraged Verdine�and she slapped his cock, HARD.

Abel winced. He knew she was angry at him, but he had been so good today. He&#8217;d not gone in the john except to pee, and although sorely tempted by the hot little sundresses of his secretary and typist, he&#8217;d been good.

�Miss Verdine, I didn&#8217;t do anything wrong today, I haven&#8217;t had an orgasm in two days.�

WHACK! Verdine slapped Abel&#8217;s face and then threw him down on the bed. She locked handcuffs on his wrists linking them to his back, and she then grabbed the thick cherrywood cane from the vanity.

SLASH! The cane left a bright red mark across Abel&#8217;s buttocks. �Goddamn you, you shouldn&#8217;t have had an orgasm in thirty days. But two days ago, you had to have an accident, and then five days before that, another accident!� 

Verdine marked Abel&#8217;s buttocks, upper thighs and back with the cane, and then she flipped him on his back and landed the cane twice across his cock and balls.

�I need orgasms, with all the pressure from these brats.� She said between her teeth as she landed the cane again, hard, on the tip of Abel&#8217;s penis, causing him to scream. �But for you, it&#8217;s just a picnic�working in your father&#8217;s firm, diddling around�you need nothing.�

Verdine tossed the cane in the corner, took up the lube and squirted a generous amount on her palm and began running it up and down Abel&#8217;s cock, getting him quite hard.

�Now, I am going to tease you for a few hours, and then you are going to go to bed without an orgasm�and right before you go to sleep, you will worship me�and make me scream with pleasure�and you will learn to control yourself!�

Abel sighed.

1990

Verdine shook her head with emphasis as Abel tried to show her the Thimble. It was a crude device, but well displayed in New York, and he&#8217;d picked it up on a business trip. �I don&#8217;t understand this, Abel.� She said with dismay. �I want you to keep your hands off your privates on the honor system. Locking you up is not the answer�I want you to just obey me.�

Abel smiled weakly. Nearly fifteen years of marriage, and no marital sex for the past ten&#8212;just his serving Verdine as a submissive male�but she didn&#8217;t let him orgasm hardly at all�and he kept erring�masturbating in bathrooms, and alone in his office. Because Verdine made him wear panties and garters under his suit, and bright red toenail polish, he couldn&#8217;t have any sort of affair�but he got his relief alone�and was punished for it!

She no longer had time to tease Abel much&#8212;Taking the kids to soccer, music lessons and to friends houses kept Verdine quite busy&#8212;while they were out on the weekends, Verdine did have Abel clean the entire house, menacing him with her bullwhip&#8212;but there was little teasing and denial fun�it was really too bad.

But she still expected him to be orgasm free! And he kept breaking down, and disappointing her.

�Well, put the damn thing on� Verdine said dispiritedly. �We can at least see how it fits you.�

2001

Abel was crouching in the closet, and he heard the buzzer. Coming out on his hands and knees, he noted that Verdine was summoning him for more drinks. She and Fillmore Krust, her black lover, were insatiable for Old Fashioneds, the drink of choice�

Abel put the fixings together for the drinks, wondering if she was going to make Abel use his mouth to get Fillmore hard before she got fucked again�it had been 93 days since Abel&#8217;s last orgasm and only that because he&#8217;d used a hairpin to break into his latest chastity device�Had he created a monster?

2010

F.X. Copeland looked with grave enthusiasm at Abel&#8217;s chastity device. Abel looked quite doubtful, but his wife was quite enthusiastic. �Can you attach the buzzer to the device, do you think, Cope?�

Cope grinned at Ms. Windom. �You betcha Ms. W. An&#8217; you kin buzz him from up t&#8217; five miles away.�

Cope was on bended knee, fiddling with the mechanics under the chastity tube, and Abel had to refrain from suggesting that while he was down there, the little redneck might as well blow him.

Abel tried to keep from sneering. Cope pronounced �Five miles� as �Faav Maahls.� It was hard to keep from being contemptuous of one so blue collar. He looked at his wife miserably. Verdine was just being ridiculous, as always. Her constant conspiracies with this dreary little craftsman were starting to seriously grate on Abel.

There were so many damned extensions to Copeland&#8217;s invention as it was. Cope had put a bit of motor energized fur around the lower area of the device, called the Cuddler, which, when Verdine hit a remote, would tease the back of Abel&#8217;s balls and his frenum and make him almost crazy to cum�but it never was quite stimulating enough for him to shoot off while locked in the device.

Then there was the idea that Verdine had to have Cope make a slightly bigger device so she could put a live salamander in the cage, which crawled around for 24 hours driving poor Abel nearly crazy, especially when he was trying to focus and teach his accounting classes at Buttermilk State U.

The device certainly was a unique one&#8212;Verdine was so enthused that she had put their sons, Reinhold and Bertrand in lock up chastity belts as well. Rye was away at MIT, and Bertie was in prep school at Andover, and they were only allowed release when they came home. (Verdine knew that Bertie was probably getting shit from his classmates when they saw his lock up device in the shower, but that was something he just had to deal with.)

Verdine had a deal with one of the Masters at the PainCafe, Thorne Thorpe�he would travel around the country and drop in on various chastity-belted sons at school and husbands on business trips. Take them to a hotel room, give them intense punishing sessions, and then afterwards, if he deemed them deserving, allow brief jack-off sessions.

Rye and Bertie had both had about two sessions each with �Uncle Thorne� when he dropped in at their campuses and whisked them off to the local motel�it was tough, and they complained to Abel continuously about their chastised state�and being forced to suck dick, what a tough deal for straight young men.

Rye had told Abel �I mean it&#8217;s hard enough not getting to hook up with the chicks here at school, but then to have to suck Uncle Thorne&#8217;s dick and lick out his asshole? Man�Mom&#8217;s really pushing it.�

The oldest boys, Abe, Jr. and Padriac were beyond Verdine's immediate control, but Abe, Jr. had found a dominant Filipino wife in Tepin, who was hot-blooded with a whip and allowed Abe,Jr. about four orgasms a year...

Their daughters were well situated in life. Euretta was married to Congressman Sterling Stillman, and few knew that one of her wifely duties was taking the State&#8217;s Representative in the ass nightly with a nine inch strap-on. 

Macel, their younger daughter was known as �Mistress Mace� in the city, and had quite a profitable keyholding service, and wrote home enthusiastically to tell her mother about the fascinating men whose chastity belts opened only for her!

And Macel&#8217;s fraternal twin brother, Padriac, who was an interior designer in San Francisco, after some bad sex experiences resulting in genital warts, stayed in long-term chastity, sending the keys voluntarily to an aunt...so all the boys were covered!

But Abel Senior felt that he had the worst deal, having to live with the chastity here at home�and now&nbsp; Copeland the craftsman was locking on a shock buzzer to his device!

Finally Cope let go of Abel&#8217;s crotch, and stood up, and then took a small round remote control device with many buttons, and grinned. �You ready, Mist&#8217; Windom?� 

Abel nodded miserably. Cope pressed a couple of buttons, and the Cuddler, which manipulated the fur and tickling wires on the back of Abel&#8217;s balls began whirring and in spite of his high dudgeon, he moaned with pleasure, closing his eyes.

Cope winked at Verdine, and pressed a red button and suddenly there was a ZZZAP! And Abel almost fell to his knees.

�Now that&#8217;s a problem.� Verdine said archly. �I need him not to fall down at work, or soil himself if I want to give him a little jolt.�

�Yup, that pissin&#8217; thang kin happen.� Cope said weightily. �I guess you been talkin&#8217; with Miz Bodenheimer.�

Verdine Windom laughed heartily. �Yes, I wish I&#8217;d been there, to see Barnaby Bodenheimer piss himself in front of his Board of Directors.� She chortled again. �Estevia, his loving wife, told me about it over lunch, and I nearly blew wine through my nose, I was laughing so hard!�

God what a heartless bitch she is, thought Abel weakly.

But of course it was considered a great thing that Estevia Bodenheimer was able to use the remote to control her husband in this way. Ever since the accident that had left Estevia a quadriplegic except for the use of a couple of fingers, she&#8217;d been unable to continue with Barnaby&#8217;s training.

Certainly she had been able to hire a young male hustler to come over and give Barney his whippings, and she always instructed Barny to drink down the urine from her leg catheter bag that he had to empty four to six times a day.

But she was unable to tease and torture her husband as she&#8217;d done in her able-bodied days, until F.X. Copeland had taken a hand!

With the Reliable ChastitiAdventurelock �, the new secured celibacy belt, not only did Barney stay orgasm free, but he could be teased and tortured by his loving wife, with her just using the handy dandy remote device�

And, the best part was that you could lock and unlock the ChastiAdventurelock � using the remote control device, which had helped Mrs. Bodenheimer, as she was unable to manipulate keys anymore, and hadn&#8217;t wanted her husband to touch them�she just had to instruct him to put on his device, and take it off, and she could press a button to lock it!

When Verdine heard about this, she had to have one too!

And now that other dominant wives, able bodied, but much too busy to tease and torture, had head of this ambitious project of Cope&#8217;s�they wanted them too!

F.X. Copeland pressed the Cuddling button again and Abel panted with intense joy as the fur rolled round his testicles..there was a small pelt of fur pasted to Abel&#8217;s frenulum, the sensitive area under his cock�and when it trembled, Abel was in total heaven.

But then Cope pressed the shock button again, and Abel screamed with pain and delirium.

Verdine looked completely entertained.
