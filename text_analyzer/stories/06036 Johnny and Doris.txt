Synopsis: Two disgusting people meet in a disgusting bar and commit a disgusting act. With any luck, anyone who reads this story will feel a need for a good shower.






This was a story I wrote on a lark. I was passing through the BDSM Library Forum and found a couple of story contests. Immediately, I was caught by one of the story contest themes: Write a story with Johnny Cash&#8217;s �Burnin&#8217; Ring of Fire� in mind. An idea immediately formed and this story was produce within about ten minutes. I don&#8217;t claim it to be my best work, though it is considerably different than my standard faire. Hopefully, you will find it as disgustingly humorous as I found it. 


Johnny and Doris 


The bar was dark and dirty. The smell of piss and cheap scotch hung in the air. The juke boxed, cracked and ready to give up its unhappy life played �Misty�. No one was listening.

Across from the bartender, seated in a booth, was a man. He was nondescript but for the long black duster and black engineer&#8217;s boots that appeared to wear him, rather then the other way around. In his hand was a pocket watch. Like the jukebox playing �Misty�, the pocket watch played music too. Like the jukebox, no one listened to the music pouring forth from the watch. 

Two booths down was a woman, nondescript but for the fact that she was less unattractive than the other women in the bar. The other women would best be described as �ugly if they were men�. The woman&#8217;s name was Doris, and she was staring at the man in the black duster.

For much of the afternoon the two stared at each other, sweat dampening their clothes and capturing dust. If the odor of the bar had started out badly this morning it was far worse in the afternoon heat. Finally, despite the sweat and grime, Doris made her move.

�What&#8217;s your name?� Doris asked the sweaty man in black as she sidled up to his booth.

�Johnny,� he replied, lighting up a short cigar.

�I&#8217;m Doris,� she said, her nostrils flaring at the cigar smoke.

�You&#8217;ve been watching me,� Johnny said. �I&#8217;ve been watching you. I like your shape. Those real?�

�Double &#8216;E&#8217; cup, honey. All natural,� she replied. �Wanna give &#8216;em a rub?�

�I was thinking of taking you in the bathroom, bending you over and giving your ass a plunge,� he said. �I know you want it. You know I want it.�

Doris gasped in mock horror. �Pretty fucking forward, cowboy.�

�Why the fuck mince words?� Johnny said. �We both want it.�

Doris turned suddenly, walking seductively as her large frame would allow, her ass shaking like cottage cheese. Johnny followed, his black jeans showing his excitement.

Johnny pushed Doris against the door to the men&#8217;s room, twisting the handle as his lips found hers. The door swung open and they pushed inside, their hands seeking out the items necessary to fulfill their lusts. Zippers sounded the beginning of their intentions, Doris grabbing his cock and pushing it through the newly opened hole in her jeans.

�Get these the fuck off,� Johnny growled, pulling his cock from the unpleasant hole.

Throwing her to the piss-dampened floor, he pulled her jeans from her body, revealing her hair-covered flesh. Disgusted, he reached down and turned her over, pulling her to her hands and knees. A moment to brace himself was all it took before he was ready to ram into the forest of matted hair between her legs.

Grunts and moans escaped the bathroom. Only the bartender listened, the bar&#8217;s patrons being too caught in their drinks and the question of what to play next on the jukebox.

Squeeze my fucking cock, bitch,� Johnny screamed at Doris.

�Get your cock inside first, peewee,� she replied, irritated by his clumsy attack.

Johnny responded by ramming into her harder, pushing her forward with each thrust. Finally, as her head pushed against the wall, Johnny pulled from her hairy hole and rammed into her asshole. She screamed in pain, trying to pull from his grasp.

�It&#8217;s in now, cunt!� Johnny screamed, plowing his meat into her ass. 

No one noticed her screams. Even the bartended was oblivious, watching the baseball game on the old color TV. It hadn&#8217;t worked for years. Today, for no apparent reason, it worked.

Johnny suddenly slipped back, his feet sliding on the damp floor. His head slammed back on the yellowed linoleum, leaving him dazed and in pain. Doris wasted no time, crawling over him to grab is cock and slide it in her ass again. 

�You aren&#8217;t getting off that easy,� she said as his cock slid in her dirty hole.

Johnny came to his senses, the pain in his head still great. Above him bounced the overweight woman, her huge floppy tits bouncing in disgusting rhythm. He reached up to take the two orbs into his hands, mashing them together lustily. He pinched the elongated nipples, twisting them. Doris arched her back suddenly, screaming out her orgasm before throwing herself forward and crushing the wind from her lover.

Johnny, his senses completely returning, reached his left hand behind the woman&#8217;s head and grasping her hair. In a moment, she was pulled from him and left to lie on her back beside him. He sat up quickly, pulling himself from the sticky floor. A quick lunge forward and he bent over the woman, pulling her up by the hair.

�Time to suck my cock,� he told her, thrusting her against his shit stained cock. Disgusted, Doris tried to protest. Her first word was muted, however, by Johnny&#8217;s first thrust. 

Pounding into her mouth, bruising the back of her throat and making her gag, Johnny enjoyed his usage of the woman. The harder he pounded the more she seemed to struggle. That only increased his pleasure. In short order, Johnny spewed his cum into her mouth, holding her against him until his pleasure was satiated. Finally, his wad spent, Johnny pushed her from him and stood panting.

�Why the fuck is your cock so red?� Doris asked, licking her lips.

�I think I got something,� he said. �I don&#8217;t know what it is. Probably the clap.�

�You fucking asshole!� 

�Well, Doris,� Johnny said. �You said you wanted to spice up our marriage. I just spiced it up.�

Stepping from the dirty bathroom, Johnny came out to the strains of Johnny Cash&#8217;s &#8216;Don&#8217;t Take Your Guns To Town&#8217; playing on the jukebox.

�Took my gun to town,� thought Johnny. �Now she&#8217;s got a burnin' ring of fire.�
