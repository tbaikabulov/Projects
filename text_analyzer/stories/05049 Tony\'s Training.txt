TONY�S TRAINING

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

By John Comstock

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�Just make yourself comfortable,�
she said.

&nbsp;

Donna McCardle had counseled a lot of women during the years
since she and her two friends had founded Orgasm Denial, Inc. (ODI), so she
knew it was important to make her guest feel at home.

&nbsp;

�Would you like some coffee?� she asked, and when the woman
nodded she walked to the coffee-maker on a table near
the wall.

&nbsp;

It was a pleasant office, with a large picture window
overlooking the city.� Donna had created
a conversation nook with a couple of love seats and a coffee table, and she
settled herself comfortably in one of the love seats.

&nbsp;

Her visitor gradually settled down.� She took a deep breath, sipped her coffee,
and leaned back in her seat.� Donna
thought she was quite attractive.� About
five-five, short blonde hair, a nice figure.�
But she suspected what was wrong.

&nbsp;

�It�s Tony,� said the blonde, who said her name was Karen.� �I�ve been married to him for three years
now, and I just don�t know . . . �

&nbsp;

Her voice trailed off and Donna waited a moment, then spoke.

&nbsp;

�Why are you here, Karen?�

&nbsp;

�Well . . . well . . . one of my friends told me about you
and thought you could help, but I don�t know.�
I mean, Tony�s a big guy and I can�t believe he�d let me get away with .
. . �

&nbsp;

�Wait a minute, Karen,� Donna interrupted.� �Men don�t let women �get away� with orgasm
denial.� They love it.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, not Tony,� protested Karen.� �He�d never agree to let me control his
orgasm.� That�s how you say it,
right?� �Control his orgasm?��

&nbsp;

Donna smiled.� �Let�s
talk about Tony for while, okay?�



Karen nodded and smiled, but there was a quaver in her eyes.

&nbsp;

�What is it that�s bothering you?� said Donna.

&nbsp;

�Well, I knew Tony was a ladies man when he married me,�
said Karen, �but he was so charming
and such a great lover.� When he asked me
to marry him I couldn�t believe it.�

&nbsp;

�And that�s a problem?� asked Donna.

&nbsp;

�Well, not at first.�
Of course, for all I know he was playing around from the day of our
wedding, but I didn�t find out about it for a few months.� One of my girlfriends told me.� And when I threw it up to him he just smiled
and said, �Well, what did you expect?�
Did you think one woman could satisfy me?��

&nbsp;

�Why didn�t you leave him?�

&nbsp;

Karen looked down at the table and didn�t say anything for a
few moments, then looked up again at Donna.

&nbsp;

�I . . . I . . . guess because . . . �

&nbsp;

Donna helped her.�
�He�s great in bed, right?�

&nbsp;

Karen sank bank in her seat and signed.� �Yeahhhh . . . and at least this way he�s
with me most of the time.�

&nbsp;

Donna leaned forward.�
�Let�s see what we can do to help,� she said, and began telling Karen
about ODI�s intervention services.

&nbsp;

*��������� *��������� *��������� *��������� *

&nbsp;

A week later, a stunning young woman dressed entirely in
black came through the front door of a bar in downtown Denver.� Every man in the place watched her as she headed
for one of the bar stools, and one of them, Karen�s husband, didn�t waste any
time.� He walked up next to her and asked
if he could buy her a drink.

&nbsp;

She looked at him and smiled.� He was a good-looking guy, about six-two,
190, with a shock of wavy black hair and a lop-sided grin.� �Sure,� she said, and gestured toward the stool
next to her.� It was all the invitation
Tony needed.

&nbsp;

Three drinks later they left and stopped at another bar down
the street � and an hour later they were walking into a large apartment
complex.

&nbsp;

�My condo�s on the top floor,� she
said, her arm linked with his.� It was an
attractive building, with a marble lobby and four very quiet elevators.

&nbsp;

She unlocked the door of her condo, walked through and
waited for him to enter and close the door, then threw herself into his arms
and began kissing him.� Tony pulled her
into him, and she could feel his cock bulging against her stomach.

&nbsp;

She moved out of his embrace and went to mix drinks, told
him to make himself comfortable on the couch.�
When she came back to him, she handed him his drink, then set hers on a table
next to the couch and went to a stereo system along the wall.� When the music started she moved slowly back
to stand in front of him, then began to sway, her body undulating to the music.

&nbsp;

Tony was transfixed.�
He took a sip of his drink, then another.� She stood in front of him, swaying, and her
hands drifted down her blouse, buttons opening like magic.� He could see her bra and the perfect mounds
of her breasts.� She shrugged off the
blouse and slowly, ever so slowly, unzipped her skirt, letting it fall to the
floor.

&nbsp;

Her panties were microscopic in size, and Tony couldn�t take
his eyes off them as he swallowed quickly and finished off his drink, then set his
glass next to hers on the table.� He
reached out for her, but she danced backwards and pushed her hands out, telling
him to wait.

&nbsp;

She continued to sway, and this time her hands went behind
her back to unhook her bra.� It came away
in one hand and she flicked it aside.�
Tony was so aroused his eyes were starting to glaze and his body was
trembling.� When she turned her back and
slowly slid her panties over her ass cheeks and down her legs, bending as she
did so, he could see her bush between her thighs.� And when she turned again to face him her
pussy seemed to be the center of his universe.

&nbsp;

He started to push himself off the couch, then
realized his hands weren�t working.� His
eyes were glazing even more, and things were becoming hazy.� He didn�t know what was happening, but his
limbs weren�t working.� And the last
thing he saw as he drifted into unconsciousness was two other women coming in
from the bedroom.

&nbsp;

*��������� *��������� *��������� *��������� *

&nbsp;

When he woke, he had no idea where he was, and it took him
awhile to realize his situation.

&nbsp;

He was naked and chained to a wall, his arms and legs
spread-eagled and his wrists and ankles clamped.� The chains were tight, so he was firmly
braced against the wall.

&nbsp;

Other than that, he was in what appeared to be a normal bedroom.� A king-size bed, a couple
of dressers, a floor-length mirror and a window looking out on a balcony.

&nbsp;

He tried jerking on the clamps and chains, but nothing
happened.� He was securely fastened.

&nbsp;

The door opened about ten minutes later and the woman he�d
met in the bar walked in.� She was just
as stunning as he remembered, but this time she was dressed entirely in white,
with a blouse, loose-fitting slacks and high heels.

&nbsp;

�And how are you
this morning, Tony?� she asked, grinning at him.

&nbsp;

�What do you mean, how am I?�
What the hell is going on?�

&nbsp;

�Well, that�s for me to know and you to find out, my
friend.�

&nbsp;

He yanked again at the clamps and chains, but they were
securely riveted into the wall.� He could
hardly move.

&nbsp;

�Don�t bother struggling,� she said.� �We�ve used those chains before.� They work.�
You�re not going anywhere.

&nbsp;

�Not unless we let you.�

&nbsp;

He didn�t say anything, just stared at her.� To his surprise, his cock began to stir.� She saw it, too, and smiled.

&nbsp;

�Good,� she said.� �We
like that. �We like it a lot.�

&nbsp;

She stood in front of him, about a foot away, and looked him
over from head to toe, then reached out and began stroking his cock.� He couldn�t believe how good it felt.

&nbsp;

�There are two rules in this room, Tony,� she said.� �Do you think you can remember two rules?�

&nbsp;

He was focused on the feelings in his cock and had trouble
nodding, but finally managed it when her hand stopped moving.

&nbsp;

�And do you think you can obey them?� she asked.

&nbsp;

He nodded again.� Anything to keep her hand moving.

&nbsp;

�Okay,� she said, pulling away and sitting on the edge of
the bed, her legs crossed at the ankles.

&nbsp;

�Rule number one:� You
have to make love to every woman who comes into this room.�

&nbsp;

His eyes widened and he started to smile.

&nbsp;

�You like that, don�t you?� she grinned.� �Of course, you�re probably not going to like
the second rule.�

&nbsp;

He waited.

&nbsp;

�Rule number two:� We
own your orgasm.� You don�t have one
unless we give you permission.� And we
may never allow you to cum.�

&nbsp;

His cock twitched.

&nbsp;

�Oh, you like that, too?� she asked.� �Well, we knew that.� Every man does.�

&nbsp;

She looked at him for awhile, watched his cock bobbing
gently, and then spoke again.� �The only
trouble is, a lot of the men we�ve had here try to
break rule two.� So we have to take steps
to make sure you�re not one of them.�

&nbsp;

She stood, walked to one of the bureaus, opened a drawer and
took something out, then came over to him.�
�This is an electronic cock ring,� she said, showing him a solid brass
ring about an inch-and-a-quarter in diameter.�
�It�s connected to a remote control device in the next room.� Once we put this ring around your cock and
balls, it will give us complete control of your behavior.� That mirror over there?� It�s a two-way mirror.� There�s a woman sitting on a couch just on the
other side, watching us.� And there will
be a woman on that couch as long as you�re in this room.� Any time she thinks you�re getting too close
to the brink, too ready to cum, she�ll push a button � and, believe me, you�ll
feel it.�

&nbsp;

Tony couldn�t believe what he was hearing and looked at the
cock ring in stunned fascination.� Not
have an orgasm?� Ever?� Not even masturbating?� How in the hell . . .

&nbsp;

He looked at the door, and she shook her head.� �It�ll be triple-locked,� she said, �and if
you try to leave we�ll put the cock ring on full stun.�

&nbsp;

She left the room for a couple of minutes, then returned with a wash towel filled with ice cubes.� Without hesitating, she wrapped Tony�s balls
and cock in the towel � and the cold compress did its work.� Within a few seconds, his dick was limp.

&nbsp;

She put aside the compress and took the cock ring from the
pocket of her slacks, fitting it easily over Tony�s waiting cock and
balls.� It settled snugly against his
groin, leaving his balls and cock free.

&nbsp;

She stepped back and watched as his cock began to grow
again, then made an almost invisible signal with her hand.

&nbsp;

�Owww!�

&nbsp;

Tony lurched against the chains as the pain swept through
him.

&nbsp;

�Jesus Christ!� he said.

&nbsp;

She smiled.� �Just
wanted you to know I wasn�t kidding,� she said, then
moved away again to sit on the bed and watch him.� �I notice the pain didn�t cause your cock to
shrink,� she said, smiling again, then just stared at
him for more than five minutes.

&nbsp;

He didn�t know what to think.� He didn�t seem to have any options.

&nbsp;

Finally, she rose.

&nbsp;

�Are you ready to cooperate?� she asked.

&nbsp;

He just looked at her.

&nbsp;

�I�m going to unclamp your arms and legs,� she said.� �If you try to do anything other than what I tell you to do, the cock ring will take
you right down to your knees.� Got it?�

&nbsp;

He swallowed, and nodded.

&nbsp;

She slowly unlatched each of the clamps, and he brought his
arms down to his sides, tested his legs, flexing a bit to get the circulation
going again.� Then he stood a foot or so
away from the wall, waiting, entirely naked except for the cock ring.� His cock was as stiff as he could remember.

&nbsp;

�Good,� she said.�
�We�re going to keep you here for awhile.� How long depends on you.� We need to be sure of you before we let you
go.�

&nbsp;

He didn�t really understand what she meant, but it didn�t
seem to matter.� At
least not just yet.

&nbsp;

She pushed him backwards onto the king-size bed and began
undressing.� �I�ve been waiting for this
since I met you in the bar,� she said.�
�You�re not a bad-looking guy, and I love being fucked by well-hung
men.� So I get first claim on you.� You�re mine for the rest of the day.�

&nbsp;

She took everything off and climbed onto the bed, straddling
him.� �Remember,� she said, �if it looks
as if you�re going to cum, my friend in the next room will know it.�� And with that she slowly began to sink down
on his cock.� Her cunt was juicy.� She�d obviously been waiting for this moment.

&nbsp;

He gasped as he entered her and gasped again as she began to
move.� His arousal grew quickly and he
thought sure he would explode � and that�s when an incredible pain shot through
him again and he cried out.

&nbsp;

�Not good enough,� she said, pausing with her cunt
completely enveloping his cock.� �I�m not
getting off you until I�ve cum, and I don�t care how many shots you take from
my friend.�

&nbsp;

The next few minutes were agony.� He found himself caught between complete
arousal and complete pain and he hardly knew what was happening when she
finally exploded above him.

&nbsp;

She slumped down on top of him, his cock still pulsing in
her cunt, then slowly rolled off.

&nbsp;

�That�s a start,� she whispered.� �Now get over here and suck me.�

&nbsp;

He responded quickly.�
He didn�t want another shot from the next room.� She wrapped her thighs around his head and
pushed it into her pussy � and within moments she was rocking her way toward
another orgasm.

&nbsp;

She fucked him half a dozen times in the next few hours, then left for awhile.�
When she returned she brought him dinner:� Steak and a salad.� �Got to keep up your strength,� she said,
playing with his cock while he ate.

&nbsp;

He was in a never-never land of sexual arousal, constantly
on the brink, constantly fearful of another shot.� He began monitoring himself more closely,
despite being driven crazy by this beautiful woman, and pulled back himself
whenever he felt himself getting too close.�
But he wasn�t very adept -- and paid the price repeatedly.� Not only that, as time went
by she seemed to be getting off on his screams and would purposely drive him to
the brink time after time after time.

&nbsp;

When she left him and told him to sleep he was completely
drained.

&nbsp;

*��������� *��������� *��������� *��������� *

&nbsp;

When the door opened the next day it was a different woman, and a different woman again on each successive
day.� They fed him well and used him constantly.� He lost track of the number of times the
women had orgasms and only gradually began to realize that shots from the next
room were becoming fewer and fewer.� On
the 15th day, he never experienced a single one.� Somehow he had learned how to control his
arousal in such a way that even though he was going crazy with desire, he
wasn�t anywhere near having an orgasm.�
And, somehow, he discovered how incredible it felt to stay right there
at the brink, all the time.

&nbsp;

Five more days went by.�
Not a single painful shot.

&nbsp;

And on the 21st day his wife walked in.

&nbsp;

�Good god,� he cried out.�
�What are you doing here?�

&nbsp;

Karen just smiled at him.�
�What do you think, dear?� I�m your woman for the day.�

&nbsp;

Tony couldn�t believe it, but it turned him on.� He�d never thought of Karen this way, as
somebody he needed to please, but after all the training he�d received, there
was nothing he wanted to do more.� He
fell to his knees in front of her, ran his hands up her thighs, raised her
skirt and buried his face in her pussy.�
She wasn�t wearing any underwear.�
She let him turn her onto the bed and suck her to a climax, then fucked him from above and below for the next two
hours.� She had five orgasms before she
tired and used the cold compress to calm him down temporarily.

&nbsp;

Then she stood and looked at him lying on the bed.

&nbsp;

�Are you ready to come home?� she asked.

&nbsp;

He blinked.� �What do
you mean?�

&nbsp;

�Are you ready to come home?�

&nbsp;

�Su . . . su . . . sure,� he stammered, not quite certain
what to say.

&nbsp;

�They told me it wasn�t possible,� she said.

&nbsp;

�What?�

&nbsp;

�That you�d get into this sort of thing,
this orgasm denial thing.�

&nbsp;

�Who told you?�

&nbsp;

�The people at ODI.�

&nbsp;

�ODI?� What�s that?�

&nbsp;

�Orgasm Denial, Inc.�

&nbsp;

�You . . . you mean this was all your idea?�

&nbsp;

Karen smiled at him.� �Yeah.� So what do you
think?� Are you ready to come home?�

&nbsp;

Tony just stared at her, but when she looked downward she
saw his cock beginning to grow again.�
She grinned.

&nbsp;

�Okay,� she said.�
�Here�s how it works.� We haven�t
had to use the cock ring for more than five days.� In fact, we haven�t even been monitoring you
for the last two.� You�ve obviously
learned how to obey the second rule, right?�

&nbsp;

Tony was surprised.�
He knew he�d been making physical adjustments, but hadn�t realized he�d
been doing it without even the threat of physical pain.� He nodded.

&nbsp;

�So, it�s time for you to come home.� But there�s going to be one big difference.�

&nbsp;

She waited.

&nbsp;

He waited.

&nbsp;

�This time,� she said, �this time I�m calling the shots.� I
have four rules:� You do whatever I tell
you to do sexually; you never have an orgasm unless I give you permission; you
don�t make love to any other woman unless I give you permission; and I�ll be
taking as many lovers as I want.�

&nbsp;

Tony couldn�t believe it, couldn�t believe what she was
saying.� But his cock and his nipples and
his entire body told him he liked what he was hearing.� Karen could see it, too.� She leaned over and stroked his cock, slowly,
looking him in the eyes.� �Those are the
rules, Tony,� she said.� �Either accept them or we�ll put you into a chastity belt and throw
away the key.�

&nbsp;

He responded the only way he knew how, the way he�d been
trained.� He looked at her and said,
�Just tell me what to do.� I�m yours.� 

&nbsp;
