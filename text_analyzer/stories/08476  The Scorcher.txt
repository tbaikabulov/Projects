The Scorcher
By Lincin
�
I: Ben
�
The heat was unbearable. It was a scorcher that hit me as soon as I drove beyond Oklahoma. Last I checked, I was still on Route 40, somewhere in New Mexico. Lost? Never, but I did have the AC turned off for the last hundred miles. Call me paranoid, but I didn&#8217;t want to take the risk with less than a quarter of a tank of gas. �You know what? That sounds stupid." I told myself and cranked the AC up to high. Instantly, I was greeted with a cold breeze of fresh arctic air that reminded me of taking a cold shower after a heavy jog on a sunny afternoon.� It felt like I was given access to arctic Utopia in the middle of a desert.
�
So, what the hell was I doing out here in the middle of a desert? Why didn&#8217;t I just buy an airplane ticket to California? �No,� I told her, �I wanted to enjoy the scenery.� What scenery? There&#8217;s desert to the left of me, desert to the right of me, mountains in the distance, tumbleweed blowing by, a big bright sun above me, and it&#8217;s over 95 degrees right now. Not to mention, it&#8217;s been over 15 miles since my phone had a signal. Nice state, huh? I should have just bought that damn airline ticket. �
�
Fifteen minutes passed. A whole lot of sand went by and virtually everything in the distance stood still. Those mountains in the distance seemed to grow only at an alarming rate of one inch per minute. �Suddenly, a small figure emerged out of nowhere calmly strolling down the highway. Is that a person or a vulture in disguise, I joked to myself. What kind of person would be walking in this heat? Guess I have to see what&#8217;s up.
�
I slowed down to a crawl and rolled up right next to him. The person turned out to be a girl, a rather attractive girl. A brunette in her mid 20s, around 5&#8217;10, very slim and athletic, wearing nothing but a sports bra, short shorts, and a baseball cap, nearly untouched by the desert heat. But for the real cr�me de la cr�me, she had a gorgeous yet bossy face, and an almost to-die-for smile looking directly at me. For the first five seconds, I could do nothing but stare at her, a lousy first impression. �Heya! My car broke down a few miles back and I was trying to reach a phone. Mind if you give me a lift?� she inquired. �Hey,� I said slowly trying to move my tongue, ignoring the five second train wreck, �Sure, hop in.�����
�
�Great. My name&#8217;s Madison.��

�Hi Madison, I&#8217;m Ben.��
�
�Nice to meet you.� She replied with a smile.

�Where you headed Madison?� I asked, acting somewhat more calmly now.
�
�Out west towards Cali to see my friends for spring break.�
�
San Diego, I thought, based on my current location and path. Though, not wanting to intrude, I continued the conversation about other matters.
�
�So I missed your car back there. In fact, I don&#8217;t think I saw anything for miles.�
�
�Yeah, I pulled over to the side of the road and hid it by some cactuses and bushes. I didn&#8217;t want anyone seeing it or trying to steal it. Looks like it did the trick alright.�
�
�Oh. Clever.�
�
�Thanks. Slow down up here, there&#8217;s a little intersection that leads to a gas station,� she said demandingly.
�
Slowing down to another crawling speed, I looked around aimlessly until I saw a small, crooked sign barely hanging on to the post that said �Gas Station. 2 Miles. Next Left.� Man, I thought, if I was driving normally looking off into the distance, I&#8217;d miss it altogether. �You&#8217;ve been out here before, have you?�
�
�Once or twice. I don&#8217;t like airplanes and I stopped at this plaza before. They had a nice person working there.�
�
Interesting, I though, as I quickly hung a left. The nice concrete highway instantly turned into a beat up, dirt road, camouflaged by the pale desert. �Great place to build a gas station, why not just do it by the road?� I complained.
�
�You see those hills up ahead? Originally, the highway ran through that which was where they built the gas station. Only problem was that the hills kept shifting and breaking the roads. So they had to move to the highway towards an area they could flatten, which is where it rests today.�
�
�And you know all this from being down here once or twice?�
�
�Sure, don&#8217;t you?�
�
�No. Not really.�
�
�Well now you do.�
�
Up ahead I saw an old gas station built around the time the Cold War took place no doubt. But gas is gas and I was a few miles shy of running on fumes. �This&#8217;ll do.� I drove up and parked. Madison jumped out, �be back in a few� and walked inside. I stepped outside and began to stretch. The desert heat hit me like a basketball thrown straight into my face. �It&#8217;s a scorcher alright.�
�
The gas station in itself looked quiet and empty but I was sure the clerk, not having much business, was either asleep or jacking off. Continuing to stretch, I laid down on the hood of my car to get some blood flowing back to my legs. It felt peaceful out here.
�
Suddenly, I heard a loud boom, something that resembled a gunshot. I rolled off the hood of my car and onto the ground. �Very good, looks like I got your attention.� I turned around to see Madison standing 5 feet behind me with a fully loaded shotgun. �Up� she commanded. I jumped up not realizing a single second of what was happening. �Madison? What are you doing?�
�
�
�
II: Madison
�
�Shut up� she yelled. She threw a large duffle bag at my feet. �Pick it up and walk that way.�
�
�What? What is-�the shotgun blast roared throughout the desert again.
�
�The next one is going to hit something you&#8217;ll miss. Now MOVE!�
�
My feet started working on their own as I picked up the bag and I started walking towards the mountains in the distance. Questions were racing throughout my mind and at the same time, I was both angry and scared. �Please don&#8217;t kill me,� I whimpered.�

�Relax; I won&#8217;t kill you, unless of course you follow my every instruction.�
�
�What instructions?�
�
�It&#8217;s simple Ben. I live here and I prey on unsuspecting victims like yourself. They are called, easy meat. I like you Ben, maybe even a little too much, so I&#8217;ll tell you what. I will make a deal with you.�
�
�What deal?�
�
�We&#8217;ll play a game. Escape and you&#8217;ll get your freedom along with a free tank of gas, some water, and maybe even a kiss. Yeah, a kiss you pervert. I saw you checking me out from the moment you pulled up. You were drooling for a clean minute. You're like every other guy I've met.�
�
�No, no, no, that&#8217;s not true.�
�
�Ben, poor boy. I know men like you which is exactly why we are going to be playing this game. However, it only works in your advantage should you win. Should you lose� well, let&#8217;s just say you become my personal slave until I get bored of you. And trust me when I say, you don't want me to get bored of you." �
�
�You&#8217;re crazy.�
�
�Maybe just a little bit. Now stop walking.�


I complied, fearing for the worst. Was she going to kill me or what? I just realized I hardly knew this woman despite the fact that I&#8217;ve talked to her for the past 30 minutes. She was in control, and there was nothing I could do about it.
�
�Strip.�
�
�What?� my eyes widen.
�
�Your clothes. Everything off. Now.�
�
Slowly, against my will, I began to unbutton my shirt. Behind me, I heard the duffle bag being unzipped. �Throw your clothes on the ground� she barked. Ignoring my instructions, my hands threw my shirt on the ground, fully exposing my chest. �Work out a lot, do we? Oh, and we also shave. My, my, what a sexy little slut.�
�
I continued by unbuttoning my pants. I slid them off exposing my legs. �Wow, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen a slut as big as you� she said laughingly. �Does your girlfriend make you shave? Is she the dominant one in your relationship? No wonder why you haven&#8217;t tried to run away yet. You are enjoying this you little pervert. You are probably even hard by now. Let's take a look.�
�
My hands gripped my boxers firmly debating on whether or not to go through with the command.
�
�Off.�
�
I dropped them fully exposing my erect shaven, seven inch cock. I regrettably threw my boxers down on the ground in front of her. �Not bad. I&#8217;ve seen both better and worse but not bad at all. Looks clean though. Shoes and socks off too.�
�
As soon as I took my first shoe off, the scorching desert heat blasted through my sock and up into my foot. The head was unbearable. It was literally like standing on a flaming barbeque grill.
�
�Stand in the shade, slut.�
�
I dove behind a narrow cactus shade and as I struggled to take off my first sock. Standing on the balls of my feet, I got the second sock and shoe off completely. I threw both of them into the pile with the rest of my clothes. �Perfect,� Madison said as she gazed upon my naked, frying body.
�
Reaching back into the duffle bag, Madison took out a can. She poured some liquid on the clothes, lid a match, and within seconds, my clothes were vaporized.
�
�Now listen here pussy, it&#8217;s about 25 miles to the nearest neighbor so we have this nice little area all to ourselves. The gas station is about 1 mile back that-away but that&#8217;s an illegal area. You go back there and I will cut your nuts off. Your car? No gas and no keys. You? No clothes and no water. The desert? Over a 100 degrees filled with snakes and scorpions. The only way to win is to survive until tomorrow night. That's all of today, tonight, and all of tomorrow. Come back to me at this very same spot and I'll bring you food, water, and gas as well as the keys to your car. Now, let the game begin.�
�
Madison started walking back in the direction we came from leaving me completely naked in the desert. I stood there on my soles of my feet wondering what to do next.
�
�
�
III: The Desert
�
It had not been long before I = started sweating like a pig. I hopped from cactus shade to cactus shade attempting to reach enough shade by the mountains to cover my entire body. I prayed the mountains could provide me with at least some kind of rock to hide behind. A cave was simply too much to ask for with my current luck. I continued hopping while I rambled to myself. Standing on the exposed sand for a second nearly burnt the flesh off my feet. Luckily, the sun was at a tilt and I had some shade to work with. I needed to survive these next few crucial hours so I could come up with some sort of plan.�
�
Words could not describe how much anger I felt rushing through my blood and at the same time, there was fear.� I didn&#8217;t know whether to shout or cry. Though, if I did that, I would just be giving in to that sadist. Somewhere out there, I thought, Madison was enjoying all this. A pair of binoculars could easily spot a figure running through the desert. I didn&#8217;t doubt for one second that she had a pair of binoculars. That bitch had done this before. That would explain the three other cars by the gas station but what happened to the owners? Fuck, I was completely embarrassed and flat out humiliated enough to not be able to think. As I progressed jumping through the shades, my junk started bouncing up and down on its own accord.
�
Eventually, I reached the ridgeline. There was a steep incline several hundred feet above my current elevation. It could not be climbed. The mountain stretched for miles to the left and right of me. Fortunately, the vegetation life started to improve a bit and I found a little area where I could rest. The desert wasn&#8217;t completely devoid of grass or bushes like some movie. This particular place however must have been chosen in advance. Bitch thought of everything, I thought, as I sat down on my ass to catch my breath. A few seconds later I passed out.
�
I could not remember how long I slept but the sun was almost down. One thing I could see though was my body turning from a near pale white color to bloodshot red. Okay, maybe that was an exaggeration but I still gained a good amount of sunburn on my shoulders, face, chest, arms, legs, and even some on my dick. I wasn&#8217;t worried though because 2-3 hours of sun wouldn&#8217;t kill you, just hurt like a bitch in the morning. I was also covered in dust and sand and my mouth was completely dry.
�
I got back up and started to walk slowly looking for water. Nothing. I needed water badly or else I&#8217;d be dead by the morning. I wouldn't even live to see the afternoon. The average human body could go for maybe up to three days without water. In the desert? Half that, if I'm lucky. My feet started to burn excessively yet I pushed forth� walking....
�
�and walking�
�
�and walking�
�
The desert was still dead, now partially dark.
�
Then it struck me - a circular black hole in the distance looking directly at me. I ran over. It was big enough to fit a truck through. I walked in.
�
The nearly depleted sun didn&#8217;t do much to illuminate the inside but I kept pressing forward. There had to have been something I could use inside. Maybe an abandoned car, a radio, telephone, gun, anything, I thought to myself. I was delusional.
�
Ten feet into the cave, the rocks started getting sharper. I couldn&#8217;t quite explain it but they were seriously started to hurt. It was as if I was walking on needles� almost. I looked down but couldn&#8217;t see anything. The cave started bending to the left, then to the right. Only a tiny beam of light remained. I forced my body to proceed for the slight, minuscule chance that there was�
�
I stepped into a puddle.
�
�water.
�
I dropped down to my knees and greedily gulfed it up. I crawled further into the cave and the puddle started getting larger. The water was well above my knees now. An underground river I thought to myself? Who cares? I dove my head into the water and kept drinking. A good three minutes went by before I stuck my head up for air. I started tending to the other parts of my body &#8211; my legs, arms, body, and face. It felt good; I felt alive. Then the lights disappeared completely.
�
�
�
IV: Dawn of a New Day
�
Light re-emerged. It was morning. My stomach roared but I didn't care. With humans, food wasn't as big of an issue as water. A solid 3 weeks before the body begins to shut down. I was simply glad I escaped death, now it was time to escape this bitch of a desert. I drank some more water before heading out.
�
Outside, it was chilly. A whopping 70 degrees. My head finally started thinking rationally telling me what to do next &#8211; scout the area thoroughly. No way was I going back to the gas station. I continued heading into the direction I was going before finding the cave. In the distance, the mountain appeared to have a little bend. I raced towards it.
�
Once there, I found a narrow yet climbable path at an angle of 50 or 60 degrees possibly creeping into the next valley. If I could make it up there, I could find another town and get help. I thought back to the map two days ago before entering this valley. I remembered seeing plenty of towns parallel to this road. It&#8217;s a long shot but a shot nonetheless. I started climbing. The path was slightly narrower then I originally saw but there were vital footings along the way. The sand was also a cool temperature due to the night and I was glad.
�
In the distance, I heard rattling and the roaring of a powerful V8 engine. I turned around and saw Madison stepping out of a Jeep. She looked furious. �GET THE FUCK DOWN FROM THERE,� she yelled, aiming her gun at me. I had no choice. I had to compile. I turned around but lost footing. Within seconds, I picked up speed sliding down the mountainside on my bare ass like an amateur snowboarder on a double diamond run.� I reached the bottom covered in dirt.
�
Madison was pissed. She picked me up and kneed me straight into the groin. I felt pain like never before in my entire life. I fell down to my knees and then onto my side while holding my sack. �So you think the rules of the game don't apply to you? That's fair. Let's just make them not apply to me neither. You&#8217;ll be my property forever.�� She kneed me again, this time in my face. It hurt.
�
She walked circles around me like a vulture before feasting on its prey and kicked me once more in the stomach. I gasped for air. Madison knew how to fight and I sure as hell wouldn't be able to take her one on one without a fighting background.
�
Quickly, she descended upon me, grabbed my arms and pulled them straight up above my head. She dragged me over to her car and tied a rope around my wrists. It was extremely tight and felt like it cut off circulation. I brought my legs up to my stomach in order to protect my precious genitalia in anticipation of further abuse... Nothing. I rolled over onto my back to scout the area. I saw her jumping into her jeep. Oh no.
�
The jeep engine roared. Shit shit shit, I thought to myself. Without another moment&#8217;s notice, it took off. I was dragged through the desert. My ass was dragged through sand, dirt, and��stone along the way. Madison kept on laughing. I was greeted with some bushes which gave me fresh bruises and scratches.� �STTTOOOOOPPP!!� I yelled.
�
The jeep stopped. I was in disbelief. I pulled myself up onto my feet from the burning Earth only to see the jeep take off again. I quickly moved my legs forward. The desert was starting to get hot again and without shade my feet were taking the brutal punishment of the sun. The jeep drove slightly faster and I tripped. I went flying forward and landed directly on my stomach with parts of package taking some damage as well. Felt like another sharp kick felt in the gut. I moaned.
�
The jeep stopped again. �We&#8217;re here.� I looked up, slowly getting back up to move my body closer to my hands so I could examine my dick. The jeep took off again. This process was repeated several times with Madison going far enough to untie the rope into tricking me it was over, retying it, and dragging me for another mile.
�
�
�
V: Nowhere
�
We finally arrived at our destination, nowhere. Madison grabbed my balls and forced me up under tremendous pressure. She released me and went back to the truck. I quickly examined my body and was amazed I had only suffered a few minor scratches and bruises� that and severely beaten testicles. The pain I felt from the kicks was residing, though I feared what was up ahead.
�
Madison came back with a bowl of water and placed it on the ground. �Drink it.� I reached down to pick it up but was instantly greeted a kick to my midsection. "Did I say you could use your hands?" I had no choice but to comply. I kneeled, crawled over, and greedily stuffed my face into it. �Good� she replied, �now bring it back over here using only your mouth.� Embarrassed and humiliated, I did just that. �Good. Looks like you aren&#8217;t as stupid as I thought you were. Now follow me in my footsteps.�
�
I resumed crawling. Madison took a zigzag-like path on some rough stones. Without a hestiation, I crawled straight onto them. My knees started to ache on the rough, burning surface of the stones. It felt like I had jumped from a grill onto burning charcoal. No doubt, this was not a natural formation, but an elaborate path set up by Madison. Soon after, it was over. In front was a circular area devoid of vegetation life and suddenly I was blind. Madison came up behind me with a cloth and tied it tight behind my head.

This could be my perfect opportunity to fight back but I was too tired, too weak, too hungry, and too banged up to do anything.
�
�Attempt to even touch that blindfold and I will rip your cock off. Move forward.� I compiled.
�
�Stop.� Once again, I complied.
�
�Now lay down on your back.� Complied.
�
�Stretch your arms and legs as far away from your body as you can.�
�
Regrettably, I did just that. I heard footsteps walking away.
�
�I&#8217;m still here loverboy.� yelled Madison.
�
A few minutes later, those footsteps came back and loud knockings were heard, two to the left of me and two to the right of me. �Stay still� yelled Madison while she proceeded to tie another rope around my left wrist. Sometime later, my right wrist. Next, they were pulled tightly away from each other at a 90 degree angle. The same was repeatedly for my ankles. I was now stretched to 4 corners.� Finally, some substance was applied to my crotch. It was also applied to my chest as well with focus on my nipples. I had no idea what was going on.
�
Madison took off my blindfold. �Time for some fun� she said, as she lit a hill on fire. �What are you doing?�
�
�I am lighting an ant hill on fire.� replied Madison with a laugh.
�
"What?"
�
"You'll see."
�
�No, no, no, no, no nonononono NO!� I yelled. �Please don&#8217;t do this.�
�
�Relax you big baby� replied Madison. �These ants aren&#8217;t that bad unless you are allergic to them. There&#8217;s a very small chance you are. Fire Ants bite painfully but I don't think it will be that bad, that is, I wouldn't know."
�
In front of me thousands of ants fled their burning colony. �The honey is going to lead them straight to you� said Madison, �your cock, balls, and nipples will be tormented.�
�
�I&#8217;ll tell you what,� Madison said retreating, �if you can survive for 5 minutes without making a peep,��I&#8217;ll give you the rest of the day off. If not, then 10 minutes will be enough� maybe.�
�
�Oh and I forgot to tell you,� said Madison, �I filled your water with crushed Viagra pills.� Any second now, your cock is going to explode into monstrous size� you know, we wouldn&#8217;t want to disappoint the fire ants, now would we?� With that being said, my cock did just that &#8211; exploded into the biggest I&#8217;ve ever seen it, pushing the seven inch erection into eight inches.
�
By this point, thousands of ants swarmed around me in a circle. Madison was waving at me in the distance, laughing, and also recording me with a camcorder. The fire ants began their assault.
�
They quickly reached my hips and feet and started climbing on top. It tickled. It tickled a lot. That tickling soon turned into torment as the ants feasted on my flesh. I screamed. Thousands of sharp little knifes in my dick. The second assault on my chest was already in progress as well. Thousands more swarmed inches away from my face, biting down even harder. I tried struggling, moving, wiggling free�. nothing worked.
�
I could see thousands of bite marks forming around my dick, I continued to scream. A few ants even climbed onto the very tip of my dick and tried to get inside my urethral opening. I wiggled my dick around but the ants hung on and continued their assault. My dick with wet with precum, 
�
The assault continued for several minutes before Madison came over with a lighter and a spray. Making a flamethrower, she killed the ants around me. She then came over with a flogger and started whopping the ants on my chest and dick. The pain was tremendous. I flinched every time she hit me. Within minutes, the pain subsided but I could still feel it echoing through my body. I looked down and stopped thousands of bite marks on my once clean body. I passed out.



VI: End?

When I woke, I realized I was on a hospital bed. Had I been rescued, I thought? I tried getting up but a force held me down. I was tied once again to all four corners of the bed. I looked down and noticed a lot of bandages around my crotch. At that moment, Madison stormed in. 

"Refreshed?"

"Fuck you." I yelled.

"Wow, such temper." I'll tell you what, this will help. 

She shoved a ball gag into my mouth and tied it tight around my head.

"I have a confession to make. I wasn't really being truthful with you this entire time. Yes I prey on young men such as yourself that pass this area once and every week. But I do it for a different reason."

"Mmmmmmm" I murmured. 

"You see, I use to work in the middle east. Use to? Whoops, I mean, still do. About a while back, I was recruited by some very powerful Arabs... female. Much to your dismay, females in the middle east know what to get if they truly want it. Originally, I worked around Europe snagging some very attractive males such as yourself and shipping them back to Saudi Arabia. These men soon become their playtoys. Anything they wanted, they got. If they wanted a jacked 30 year old with a big penis to stick into an ant hole, they got it. If they wanted a little scrawny kid with a small dick to humiliate and lock up, they got it. Hell, if they wanted the manliest of mans to dress up as a cross-dresser, they got that too. Now they want you." 

Madison slowly started walking circles around my bed. "The camcoder? Just some footage I sent them. You passed the minimum requirements." 

I slowly and slowly sunk into dismay. Was she telling the truth or just continuing to torment me like with the truck? 

"Although, I should be honest. If you aren't impressive, subjects are typically discarded within a week. Shot? Stabbed? Just left to starve to death? There's been worse. Apparently, this one time, some guy attempted to escape. They caught him of course and beat him day by day for a month. After they got bored of this, they simply tied him up somewhere in the desert and left him. No one knows what happened. I think it's safe to guess it didn't turn out well."

I turned into a palely ghost figure. 

"Do you know what kind of things are out in the desert? No, I mean, the real Arabian desert where there's no signs of life for miles. You didn't bump into any rattlesnakes here, did you? Any scorpions? Any spiders? The Arabian desert is thriving with those creatures and this time, no one will be there to save your ass." 

My moans started getting quieter and quieter. 

"But you shouldn't worry about that if you give in to them. I know some of them. In fact, I've been to their houses before. Very fair women unlike you pigs. Lots of maids in little french uniforms. A couple of slaves being teased and denied for 12 hours a day / 7 days a week, up to a month. I believe they even have some eunuchs. Now whether or not they were captured like that before or after is anyone's guess."

By this point, all my peeks were silent. Tears started rolling down my eyes. I was afraid of what was going to happen. I didn't want to leave my home, my girlfriend, all the things I had going for me. 

"So this is how it's going to happen. I'll give you one final day here to rest up, you are going to need it. Then you'll be tied up and shipped by truck to the East Coast. Once there, you'll be given a few additional hours of rest. You'll be given some laxatives and a few enemas to empty your bowels. Wouldn't want the smell to attract unwanted attention. Then you'll be tied up again, extremely tight, with only access to water, and shipped in a box, on our private airliner. The trip is 15 hours. I hope you'll enjoy it."

I could not believe what she was saying. This is impossible. This can't happen.

"Once there, you'll be taken to some house. Then you'll be bid on by wealthy females. So make sure you sell yourself good. You wouldn't want to be bought up by the cheap ones, would you?" 

I entered a blank state of gaze. 

"Well, it's been fun, but I got to move on. Got to get make some more money. You'll be picked up by some of my associates tomorrow morning. This is the last time you'll see me. You've been a delight Ben. Good bye."

She turned off the lights and left the room.
