The Training of Slave Girl Shana, Chapter 1

&nbsp;

In the decades that followed the global energy and food shortages, and
the subsequent collapse of various economies, the old polities disintegrated
into city states and feudalism. The rich were excessively so, and exploited the
poor for their own private gain.����� 

&nbsp;

Inside the complex on the far side of the mountain, near the ruins of
the Oratory, the auditions were over, and a slave girl was �hired� for the
Master�s personal indulgences. Her name was Shana, and upon her arrival, she
had been made to shower, shave her legs, and do her own hair and makeup, as per
specific instructions from the Understudy, who had hired her. His commanding
voice was still ringing in her head as she stripped off her street
clothes.� 

&nbsp;

�Two rules to always remember, above all.� First, obey everyone in this building.� Everyone.�
There is no one lower here than you.�
Two, no matter what, you will make no protest.� No matter what.�� 

&nbsp;

The shower room was just off the change room, and had the appeal of a
surgical suite with green ceramic tiles, a plastic shower curtain, and the
copper drain obscenely pulling the curves of the floor towards it.� A small makeup counter with a hair dryer and
cosmetics mediated the small space between the shower room and the change
room.� The change room had just a Roman
couch and a full-length mirror. A doorway in the opposite wall led into the
large, airy studio beyond. 

&nbsp;

When she had emerged from the shower, she found all her street clothes
were gone. A selection of clothing had been laid out for her, and only one
selection of footwear, plus an ankle bracelet.��
The Understudy had mentioned the ankle bracelet, had stated flatly that
the bracelet was a mark of her new status, and was never to come off,
ever.� Dainty, black, heeled sandals,
with straps and buckles over the toe, and no straps at the back were placed by
the couch.� She had only two odd and
disconcerting choices to go with the shoes.�
The first was a black, long sleeved leotard with sheer arms and a wide,
scooped neck.� The second was a white,
tight, ribbed short-sleeve top, cut like a leotard but only coming to her
navel.� It was paired with a short,
wraparound denim miniskirt.� Finding the
leotard odd, Shana had slipped on the white top and then reached for the
skirt.� It was then she realized no
panties were offered.� No bra.� 

&nbsp;

She had looked around the dressing room, only seeing the couch and the
full length mirror. When she put the skirt on, she shuddered.� It was so uncomfortably short and
exposed.� The wrap barely made it around
her thighs, and a slit opened threateningly, where she had tied it closed,
every time she moved the wrong way.� She
checked herself in the mirror and shuddered again.� So much of her bare legs and thighs were
showing.� She turned around and looked
over her shoulder and leaned forward.�
The skirt�s hem hadn�t shifted upwards a centimetre before the bottoms
of her bare cheeks showed.� That had been
too much for her, and she�d taken off the skirt and top and slipped on the
leotard.� Again, she looked in the mirror
with dismay.� The legs were cut so high
in the front, her pelvic bone was visible.�
And when she walked, she could feel the back of the leotard begin to
creep up over the cheeks of her tush.� It
would have to do. It was better than the little skirt with no underwear.������������������������� 

So now she stood before the Understudy, her bare legs on display,
wearing only heeled sandals and a tight leotard that rode up her backside with
every movement.� She was very uncomfortable.
Mirrors lined every wall and the ceiling, reflecting her image to infinity. The
optical effect was disorienting.

&nbsp;

�What�s your name?� asked the Understudy.

&nbsp;

�Shana,� replied the girl. 

&nbsp;

�You will be called Slave Shana. Are you uncomfortable, Slave Shana?������������ 

&nbsp;

�Yes.�������������������������� 

&nbsp;

�Is it because of what you�re wearing?� 

����������������������������������������������� 

Shana looked down at herself and hesitated. �Yes.�

&nbsp;

�Good. Now, first lessons first,� the Understudy began.� �The Master likes you to pose for him. When
before the Master, you must always sit unless asked otherwise, and you must
adopt the right pose.� If he does not
request a specific pose, than you shall always adopt Pose Number Two.� Do you understand this?�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� said Shana quietly.

&nbsp;

�Good. Now take off your shoes.�

&nbsp;

Shana looked down, hesitated, and the slipped off the tiny shoes into
her bare feet.

&nbsp;

�This is the first step of Pose One,� the Understudy continued. �The
second step is to kneel down.�� Shana did
as she was told.� �That is Pose One.�
Shana looked at the Understudy dubiously, her hands in her lap, her bare feet
tucked under her rear, with her toes emerging at the back.

� 

�Now, tuck your legs to one side.��
Shana shifted her weight onto her left hip, rested the weight on her
arms, palms on the floor, and tucked her legs back to the side.� �Now pull one knee forward a little - stagger
your legs a bit while they are tucked to the side.� Shana checked herself in
the mirror and let one knee come forward a bit.�
�Good.� The last step is to point
your toes.�� Feeling very uncertain, she
let her bare feet arch. �Harder. Point them prominently.�� Shana arched her bare toes like a gymnast�s.
It was a strange exercise to be asked to perform, and Shana suddenly felt
wierded out and self-conscious.

&nbsp;

The Understudy paced around her, making small adjustments to her arms,
her legs, firming up the pose, making it as feminine as possible.� �Very good,� said the Understudy. �You will
always remember this as Pose Two.�
Relax.�

&nbsp;

Shana let her toes relax and shifted to a more comfortable position.� Looking ahead in the mirror, she could see a
disconcerting expanse of bare thigh, and felt behind her how the bodysuit had
ridden far enough up her backside so as to expose most of her tush. With
nothing on under the leotard, Shana feared what might show.� Instinctively, she reached behind, hooked her
thumbs under the lining and pulled the suit back down over her cheeks. The
Understudy didn�t miss a movement.

&nbsp;

�I�ll warn you now,� said the Understudy, �that modesty only has its
place when the Master is not looking at you.�
He is never to see you do anything of that sort.��� A wave of doubt coursed through her.� With strange instructions like these, would
any amount of salary be worth this?� Just
how sexually eccentric, just how sexually mad was the Master?� �For the time that I am training you, I will
be treated as would the Master. Understand?� Shana nodded her understanding.��������� ����������������������������������� 

&nbsp;

�Good. Now, then, Pose Three.��
The Understudy paced back in front and stood over Shana.� Shana looked up meekly.� �Poses flow from one to the other, like Tai
Chi.� This will help you to remember
which pose is which. Soon, it will become all unconscious for you, and you will
be able to glide from one movement to the next, like a dance, you see?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, sir.�

&nbsp;

�Good. First, adopt Pose Two.�

&nbsp;

Shana posed her legs, pointed her toes and then looked up expectantly.

&nbsp;

�Now, keeping your legs in the same position, move your upper body down
and recline on your side.�� Shana
reclined on her side, the legs tucked and allowing her hips to undulate
gracefully into the curve of her midsection.�
She felt the pull on the back of her bodysuit as it slid up her
cheeks.� She fought the urge to reach
behind her.� The Understudy paced
leisurely around her.� �Look in the
mirror in front of you.� Now you see how
the line of your pointed feet, your legs, your hips, your torso and your
breasts all flow in one line. They work togther, yes?�� Shana nodded.�
She had never considered the graceful shapes her body could make in such
an obsessive manner.� She looked over her
shoulder at the mirror behind her, saw the wrinkled soles of her arched feet
and then the firm, partially-naked cheeks of her tush.� She felt dizzy, and turned her head back.� Again the Understudy walked around her and
corrected minor flaws, until she held the pose perfectly.

&nbsp;

�Are your toes sore?� asked the Understudy.� Shana nodded.�
�Later, on your own, you can exercise your feet by pointing your toes
and holding them for several minutes until it becomes more comfortable, and
that will allow you to point your toes perfectly and painlessly.�� Shana felt another wave of doubt.� The Master had an obsession with pointed
toes? With ballerinas?� Or with gymnasts?
She was reminded of the leotard she was wearing.� She suddenly had flashbacks of her family,
and longed for home, instead of reclined on the floor in the twisted parody of
a dance studio, wearing only a brief leotard with bare legs and feet while
being made to feel like a lawn ornament. 

The Understudy walked back in front again, and looked down.� �Pose Four.�
From Pose Three, roll onto your stomach, legs out behind you, tops of
your feet against the floor.�� Shana slid
from the pose and onto her stomach, resting her head in her arms. �Head up!�
the Understudy said sharply, �bring your chest up off the floor.� Now, bring your legs up behind you, cross
them at the ankles and point your toes.��
Shana did as she was told, again looking up at him expectantly. 

&nbsp;

�This pose has some variation,� said the Understudy, �but the variation
is all in the feet. Variation A is what you are doing now. Variation B is to
uncross the ankles and have your feet evenly together, side by side, toes
pointed.� Variation C is the same as
Variation B, except that you do not keep your feet evenly together. Variation D
will have you cycle between the first three variations, slowly, allowing your
feet to brush together.� Do you
understand this?�� Shana shook her head
�no,� mystified.

&nbsp;

�Very well, let�s have you adopt each variation. First A, then B, then
C.�� Shana crossed, uncrossed, then
staggered her arched feet.� �Now cycle
through it, as per Variation D.�� She did
so, and as she did, the soft hissing of her bare feet rubbing against each
other could be heard in the ensuing silence of the room.� �That is the sound I want to hear,� said the
Understudy. �Do you see how it is a pleasing sound?�� Shana began to shake her head, thought better
of it, and wordlessly nodded instead.

&nbsp;

�Good. Then practice this on your own time, in your chambers, and let�s
do Pose Five. This is the hardest of them.�
It is best practised in the leotard to observe that the lines of your
body are correct.�� Shana wondered to
herself whether the skirt hadn�t been such a bad idea, as she felt the extent
to which the leotard had worked its way up the backs of her cheeks, and wished
the Understudy would look away long enough for her to adjust it.� The Understudy knelt beside her as she lay on
her front, holding Pose Four.

&nbsp;

�From this, let your legs back down to the floor and roll over onto your
back, keeping your toes pointed and your arms out from your sides,� said the
Understudy.� Shana relaxed her calves and
silently rolled onto her back.� �The next
movement is done as one fluid motion, but you will first break it into two
movements before putting them together.�
First, bring your knees up off the floor and cross your ankles at the
same time. This is what the bottom half of your body does.�� Keeping her toes pointed, Shana crossed her
ankles while drawing her knees up until the heels of her feet rested on the
floor.� �Now, the top half.� Straighten your arms, brace your hands, palms
out on the floor, and arch your back. Let your head drop back as far you can.� Do this slowly.�

&nbsp;

Shana strained against gravity as her back arched and her arms quivered,
working to hold her weight while she kept her legs and feet in the same
position. �More, more arch,� said the Understudy, �straighten the arms more and
let the head drop right back, almost to the floor.�� Shana gritted her teeth and began to grunt in
effort.� The Understudy was not deterred.
�Let your mouth open. Don�t clench the jaw. Relax it.�

&nbsp;

��Oh God, this is hard on my
back!� Shana moaned.� The Understudy
stood up, hooked a foot around her left wrist, pulled firmly, and Shana landed
flat on her back abruptly, hitting the base of her head on the floor.� Everything was suddenly silent.

�I did say it would be hard.� I
didn�t say you should complain.�

&nbsp;

The Understudy let the silence sink in, broken only by Shana�
panting.� Her face flushed red with
exhaustion and embarrassment.� She lay on
her back, arms out, her long hair spilling out behind her head, her breasts and
nipples - prominently outlined by the tight fabric - heaving with each breath,
her long legs - bare from high on her hips to her arched feet - still in the
lower half of Pose Five.� The Understudy
let her lay this way for a minute. Shana felt the cool wood of the studio floor
against the cheeks of her ass.� She
glanced up at the mirror on the ceiling, reflecting back her supine form from
above, highlighted by the graceful, revealing lines of the black leotard.� The reflection above was a perfectly framed
photo of herself - a young girl lying on a studio floor in a skimpy leotard -
she felt the pressure behind her eyes and considered the tears she could let
flow, but then the Understudy was speaking again.

&nbsp;

�There is, of course, lots of physical exercise that will be part of
your training. This will help you in poses such as Pose Five...� the Understudy
paused before continuing,� �...and, of
course, in other things too.� But in the
meantime, you will give every effort, and you will give no complaint.� Is that understood?�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� Shana whispered.

&nbsp;

�Good. Do it again.�

&nbsp;

Shana took a deep breath, arched her upper body and let her head fall back,
chin pointing up, exposing the long line of her extended throat. Her lips
parted.� She began to pant with exertion.

&nbsp;

�Hold it. Keep holding it.� The voice of the Understudy seemed further
away as the blood rushed to Shana� head. �Now relax.�

&nbsp;

Shana dropped to the floor and rolled onto her side, catching her
breath.

&nbsp;

�Very good, that was better than before,� said the Understudy
calmly.� �And so you will find Pose Six
much easier. Sit up, sit on the floor, legs out.�� Shana slowly rolled onto her back and sat
up.� �Don�t quite hug your knees, merely
place your hands naturally on them, and draw your legs up toward your chest.
Turn to the mirror and try this.�

&nbsp;

Shana faced the mirror, and drew her knees up to her chest. The
Understudy paced behind her, looking at her reflection in the mirror.� �Arch your feet again, let only the tips of
your toes touch the floor. If you are wearing shoes, make sure both the heel
and the toe of the shoe are in contact with the floor. The higher the heel, the
more you will have to draw your legs up to do this.�� Shana stared at her reflection, at her
pointed toes, her legs, her knees, her thighs underneath, and the cheeks of her
tush.� The outline of her pussy was
clearly visible, almost exposed with the leotard pulled taut against it as it
rode up her back. She blushed deeply at the sight and looked away.

&nbsp;

�That is all for today.� I want
you to practice these in your chambers.�
You will remember them all, and I will see improvement tomorrow,� said
the Understudy. �Take a shower for that sweat I see you�ve worked up.�� The Understudy left.� Shana was alone.� She looked around, got up and walked back over
to where she had left the black heeled sandals.�
She pulled the leotard back down over her hips and slipped the shoes
on.� Once back in the change room, she
gratefully pulled off the leotard, kicked off the shoes and stepped into the
shower stall.

&nbsp;

The warm water felt good on her body, and Shana leaned into the spray,
heavily against the wall, bracing herself with her arms and resting her
head.� The warmth began to relax her
tense body, the relaxation gave way to a deep sigh, and the deep sigh gave way
to sobs.� The loneliness and the homesickness
welled up inside her, and for a minute, no money in the world seemed worth
it.� Then she remembered her parents,
that this was for her parents, and her sobs ebbed as she pulled herself
together.� Surely there would be other
slaves , she thought to herself, and surely then there would be some company. 

&nbsp;

She finally stepped out of the shower and towelled herself off.� Finding a small hair elastic had been left
next to the hair dryer, she put her long hair in a ponytail, wrapped the towel
around herself and peeked out into the change room.� Nobody was there, but gone were the leotard
and shoes, and in their place, nothing but a light bundle of green fabric
draped across the couch.� She picked up
the bundle and held it up in front of her.�
It seemed to be some sort of tunic, with a kind of uniform quality about
it.� Again she checked around her and
could see no other clothing offered.� She
took a deep breath, removed the towel, and slipped the tunic on over her head
and wriggled into it.

&nbsp;

The fabric was surprisingly comfortable, like a soft cotton twill.� It had short sleeves and a high, even collar
with a notch cut in the front, just like a priest�s.�� It had a crisp, professional press to it,
greatly flattering her upper body.�
Again, however, its hemline was very, very short.� Shana felt almost desperate for something to
wear under it as she turned first one way, and then another, looking at herself
in the mirror.� She found she could bend
a little further than when in the denim skirt, but it made little difference.� She had only an inch, it seemed, between her
modesty and her betrayal.� And where were
her shoes?� She walked around the room,
looked under the couch, even checked in the shower area, but could find
nothing.� A knock on the door made her
jump and she rushed quickly over to open it.�
It was the Usher, who tapped the wristwatch and motioned for her to
follow.� 

&nbsp;

She went after the Usher into the passageway, walking gingerly in her
bare feet on the cold, polished cement.�
The Usher said nothing as she was led down the passageway in the
opposite direction from the front gate.�
As before, the interior of the building was clean, but industrial.� Portions of the corridor looked like they had
been patched together from scrap material, and the lighting consisted of
torches set in the walls at intervals with iron brackets.� It was in stark contrast to the polished,
professional, well-lit studio she had been in.

&nbsp;

At a junction in the corridor not far from where they�d come, the Usher
turned left and ducked through a low-cut door.�
She followed him through the door and immediately down a flight of steps
that led into a narrow, claustrophobic passageway.� It was like being in the bowels of an old
Trident nuclear submarine, with what looked like berths, holes, vents, ducts or
other halls, all the way along the passage.�
The passageway stopped at a dead end.�
The Usher gestured at a metal ladder soldered haphazardly onto the wall
on the right hand side.� It was a short
ladder, about ten rungs, and it led to an opening in the wall just above head
height. A dark blue, velvety curtain covered the opening.

&nbsp;

�In there are your quarters, Slave Shana,� the Usher gestured
upward.� �This wing is for the
slaves.� Everything you need for your
personal chambers are in there.� If
someone such as myself or a steward of the house should bang on your door, immediately
assume Pose One on the floor.� Do not
expect privacy.� You may go inside,
now.�� The Usher waited.� Shana took hold of the rungs of the ladder
and paused.� The Usher did not move, but
stared stoically back down the hall. Shana swallowed hard, and then placed a
bare foot gingerly on the first rung, and pulled herself up.� As she climbed, she felt the Usher�s eyes on
her.� Her face burned and she could not
help but look around behind her as she reached the top of the ladder.� The Usher�s eyes were fixed steadily on her
behind, looking intently, but impassively, up the back of her skirt.� The Usher�s eyes flicked to the bottoms of
her bare feet and then up again under the short hem to her bare tush, vulva and
the hint of her pussy.� Shana pulled the
curtain aside and fled into the chamber, pulling the back of her tunic against
her rear as soon as she got a free hand.

&nbsp;

She found herself inside what seemed like a treehouse.� She could stand up inside the room, but there
wasn�t much more than two inches of space between her head and the
ceiling.� A phosphorous lamp warmly lit a
chamber big enough to hold a twin futon, a net port, a small table with two
chairs, a pearl-coloured pedestal sink, cupboard, a huge mirror against the far
wall, and� a book case against the other.


&nbsp;

A bookcase.� Shana stared in
astonishment.� It actually held
books.� Lots of them.� She had only ever seen perhaps three books in
her life.� Most of her reading was from
porting into the net.� She crossed the
room - a matter of a few steps - and looked at the books. They� were utterly foreign to her, and musty. An
eclectic, aimless, jumble of titles and names.�
It was the largest collection of books she had ever seen - three
shelves.� That was far greater than any
library she had been in as a child, and the city no longer had libraries.

&nbsp;

She tore her attention away from the sight long enough to see her bag
had been left on the bed.� Quickly she
went over and dumped everything out.� All
that she had packed, including her photos and her stuffed bear, were still
there, much to her relief.� Nothing of
her old street clothes were inside.� She
inspected her room more closely, and found nothing else to wear except a blue,
satin robe under her pillow.� Curious,
she took it and put it on over her tunic.�
It tied with a sash and, unsurprisingly, was a short as her tunic.� She collapsed on the bed, tired, but without
any idea what time it was.� Her watch had
gone with her old clothes, and now she lay on her side, the first rest she�d
had since arriving.� She gazed at herself
in the big mirror, and realized it was probably for practising in front
of.� She studied the green tunic, how it
fit her body so well, how it had ridden up to expose her pussy as she lay
there.� She reached down and gave it a
half-hearted tug to cover herself, craving a pair of jeans.� Remembering the Understudy�s words, she
stretched out her bare legs and flexed her toes while waiting for sleep to
come.�� She was in the middle of arching
her feet when someone banged on the rungs of the ladder.

&nbsp;

Shana leapt off her bed and quickly adopted Pose One in the middle of
the floor.� She tugged the skirt down
over the front of her thighs to cover her pussy.� As she did so, she felt it pull up in the
back, and felt her bare seat against the soles of her bare feet as she
knelt.� A hand jerked the curtain
aside.� It was the Usher.
