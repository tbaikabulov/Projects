To the Oak and �

Life was much quieter in the new stable where Judith and Beth kept their personal mounts.&nbsp; Between Beth&#8217;s visits, the hands made certain that Big Boy was kept well groomed and in excellent condition. 

Just like any other morning, the grooms roused Big Boy soon after dawn. Today they told him that he might expect Beth.&nbsp; Big Boy treasured his sleep and hated to be awoken, but he was always eager to see his mistress, Beth.&nbsp; He thirsted endlessly for her attention.&nbsp; He lived and breathed for her approval.&nbsp; His yearning was endless.&nbsp; Ponies are herd animals and Beth, like the mistress of any well-run herd, had impressed herself on her Ponies as the uncontested leader of their herd.

Big Boy drank some water and did his necessary business while the grooms waited impatiently.&nbsp; Too much to eat or drink before a ride made a pony sluggish and lazy.

Finished, Big Boy stood passively but impatiently while the grooms attached his saddle and bridle.&nbsp; He could barely restrain his roiling excitement.&nbsp; The petite girl&#8217;s determined grasp on his nose lead was little more than symbolic, given their disparity in size and strength.

The saddle, a small leather seat, perched between his shoulders at the base of his neck.&nbsp; The strong but light aluminum tubes were secured to the thick belt that circled his waist and supported the saddle to lower the center of gravity.&nbsp; Adjustable stirrups hung from the saddle.&nbsp; One strap of his bridle circled his forehead with handholds on either side and a second strap passed under his nose.&nbsp; Together, they held the reining rods in place, thin wooden dowels that intruded into his sensitive ear canals.&nbsp; Pressure on a rod pulled his head promptly to the left or right and yoked his considerable strength fully into the service of his rider.

Saddled and bridled, Big Boy was secured to the slip rail.&nbsp; A metal ring pierced the glans of his cock.&nbsp; The grooms clipped this ring onto a second ring that pierced his navel, lifting his penis safely out of his groin and away from his brawny thighs, exposing his fat scrotum beneath.&nbsp; Once male genitals had been the symbol of male dominance.&nbsp; Now they were the symbol of male vulnerability.

Soon, a second, unfamiliar mount, similarly saddled and bridled, was tied to the slip rail beside him.&nbsp; The two males examined each other suspiciously.&nbsp; Big Boy shared the stable with a number of mounts and he disliked each of them individually and despised them all collectively.&nbsp; In his jealous eye, each was a rival for Beth&#8217;s favor.&nbsp; His intense hatred was returned with equal passion.&nbsp; All the intact males vied desperately for the attention of the trainers, exercise girls, and grooms, as well as the riders.&nbsp; Jealously was the norm and actual fights were not uncommon.

Big Boy hated Beth&#8217;s other mounts most of all.&nbsp; Like many riders, Beth kept several Ponies.&nbsp; Beth loved long rides and she often took a spare Pony along so that she might change mounts midway and keep a fresh mount under her.&nbsp; All proudly wore her brand.&nbsp; All competed fiercely for her attention and prized any precious hint of her favor.&nbsp; Beth had vainly hoped that her Ponies might get along better.&nbsp; Somehow, they might be friends, she hoped, if only to please her.&nbsp; They should take pleasure, she hoped, or at least take comfort in each other&#8217;s company in the stable or on her Pony trailer.

Caitlin laughed at Beth&#8217;s stereotypic female sentimentality and naivet�.&nbsp; A dog might be a more fitting companion for an intact male than another male, the chief trainer had explained to her old friend more than once.&nbsp; Sometimes, it seemed that only Beth&#8217;s fierce will kept any sort of peace among the quarrelsome beasts.&nbsp; At best, the creatures tolerated each other and only barely in order to preserve Beth&#8217;s good will.&nbsp; More than once, Caitlin had pointed that castration was a ready option to decrease the level of tension in the stable.&nbsp; Her geldings in the main stable caused much less trouble.

However, elite riders often preferred intact males.&nbsp; A more spirited mount might provide a more thrilling ride.&nbsp; While distractible, lazy, and prone to violence, a very special bond might be formed between a rider and her mount.

Big Boy was always covetous of his mistress&#8217; attention.&nbsp; This new male beside him at the slip rail was not at all familiar.&nbsp; He had no knowledge of the other&#8217;s standing in Beth&#8217;s esteem and his claim for her attention.&nbsp; Big Boy&#8217;s ignorance inflamed his insecurity and made the other seem an even more dangerous rival.&nbsp; He feared that he might have to share Beth&#8217;s attention today.&nbsp; He glared at the stranger.&nbsp; 

The stranger glared angrily back.&nbsp; The other Pony was large, but few Ponies were as large as Big Boy.&nbsp; Big Boy stood up straighter to flaunt his greater stature.&nbsp; The stranger showed Big Boy his teeth.&nbsp; Big Boy pulled against the slip rail.&nbsp; He stomped his foot and kicked the dirt in frustration as the other was just out of his reach.&nbsp; The stranger turned and Big Boy saw that his brand was not Beth&#8217;s.&nbsp; The stranger looked back at Big Boy and farted.

A short time later, Beth came down to the stable from breakfast.&nbsp; Her dark hair was braided in a tight ponytail for riding.&nbsp; A brilliant white silk blouse and black leather jodhpurs accented her olive complexion.&nbsp; Knee-high black leather boots enclosed her small feet and accented her shapely calves.&nbsp; Thin, supple riding gloves covered her graceful hands.&nbsp; She could feel a male&#8217;s beard through the thin black leather.&nbsp; From her belt, hung her worn leather crop.&nbsp; A smile illuminated her face.&nbsp; Her glittering silver rowelled spurs jingled when she walked.&nbsp; Beth often joked that she felt absolutely naked without her spurs. 

Big Boy heard her jingle jangle of her spurs and recognized her perfume before he saw her.&nbsp; He did not miss the spurs&#8217; glistening sharp points or overlook their meaning for an instant.

Caitlin, Beth&#8217;s good friend, followed eagerly a step behind.&nbsp; She had tied her thick blonde hair back in a French braid for the day&#8217;s exertions.&nbsp; She wore a white blouse over white leather jodhpurs and white boots.&nbsp; She had brought the other mount, a gelding named Lucky, from the main stable.

Beth and Caitlin had been friends for since college.&nbsp; As teenagers, they had worked together as grooms at the Blake&#8217;s Mountain Stables.&nbsp; Caitlin had pursued her interest and become a trainer.&nbsp; She was taller than Beth and blonde.&nbsp; Beth had become an attorney.&nbsp; Caitlin&#8217;s build was more athletic while Beth&#8217;s was more petite, though Beth was no fragile flower.&nbsp; Beth&#8217;s wiry frame provided unexpected strength.

Caitlin had always had a great sense of humor.&nbsp; One time, she had touched her sex and rubbed her finger, redolent with female scent, under the noses of four unsuspecting Ponies tied at the slip rail.&nbsp; A number of women bringing their daughters for an after-Sunday school ride had found three of the four sporting rampant erections &#8211; all but the gelding.&nbsp; Doc Johnson had a schedule busier than usual the following week.

Beth saw the mounts secured at the slip rail, saddle and bridled, already waiting.&nbsp; The stable was well ordered and well run.&nbsp; The Ponies were both fine specimens and well groomed.&nbsp; Their strong legs supported muscular buttocks and broad backs offered their riders secure seats.&nbsp; Their male size and strength were undeniably impressive.&nbsp; Beth&#8217;s easy confidence in her undeniable mastery elated her.

She ran her gloved hand over the thick muscles of Big Boy&#8217;s back.&nbsp; He pulled against the slip rail and pushed himself back against her hand, trying to increase the contact.&nbsp; She patted him on his muscular rump fondly.&nbsp; He was a spirited creature, and he was hers.&nbsp; Her brand marked him unmistakably as her property for all to see.&nbsp; She thrilled to own such a magnificent beast.&nbsp; His skin was smooth and hairless.&nbsp; Except for the hair of his head and his closely cropped beard, her grooms kept completely depilated.&nbsp; Ponies were waxed regularly.

Beth chuckled when remembered her days as a groom when Caitlin and she struggled with an uncooperative mount.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t enjoy his waxing &#8211; not in the slightest.&nbsp; He enjoyed it even less when Caitlin held his buttocks apart, while Beth, flashlight and tweezers in hand, searched out the last elusive hairs around his anus.

As always, Big Boy was glad to see his mistress, even giddy.&nbsp; Trying to turn toward her, he pulled unsuccessfully at the slip rail.&nbsp; His attention focused on her gloved fist.&nbsp; More often than not, she brought him some sort of treat.&nbsp; Salty or sweet, anything with flavor was a welcome relief from the bland monotony of the healthful stable diet.

Beth slid his lead from the slip rail.&nbsp; Eagerly, Big Boy turned his head and nuzzled her fist, hoping for a treat.

Grinning, Beth pressed her opened but empty hand over his open mouth.&nbsp; His fat tongue tickled her palm through the fine thin leather.&nbsp; Big Boy&#8217;s enthusiasm faded when he found her hand was empty.&nbsp; A sad frown darkened his guileless face.

�Silly Boy!� Beth said affectionately.&nbsp; She reached into her small pocket and retrieved a piece of dried fruit from her slit pocket.&nbsp; Big Boy opened his mouth to receive it.&nbsp; Careful to avoid his teeth, Beth popped it into his mouth.

Immediately, Big Boy sensed that the treat shared the warmth of Beth&#8217;s body.&nbsp; He enjoyed its tart sweetness.&nbsp; The dirt and lint acquired in its passage through Beth&#8217;s tight pocket did not diminish his pleasure; rather he envied its nearness to her body.

Beth slipped his reins from the rail and touched her crop to his knee.&nbsp; Immediately, Big Boy knelt with his left knee touching the ground and his right leg bent.&nbsp; Beth stepped up smartly on his brawny right thigh and swung her left leg over his thick neck, seating herself securely in the saddle.&nbsp; Her booted feet deftly found their places in his stirrups.

Beth jabbed him lightly with her sharp spurs and he rose quickly to his feet.&nbsp; Given his size and strength, Beth&#8217;s petite form was little burden.&nbsp; Eager to be off, Big Boy turned to the door in anticipation of Beth&#8217;s command.&nbsp; Beth pulled him back sharply and he fought the reins briefly.&nbsp; She jabbed him with her spurs &#8211; sharply -to gain his attention and he stopped.&nbsp; Sentimental as she was, Beth had great affection for her beasts.&nbsp; However, she brooked no disobedience.&nbsp; Big Boy, spirited as ever, took one more rebellious half-step.&nbsp; An experienced rider, Beth raised and lowered her heels, dragging her spurs over the bare skin of his flanks.&nbsp; The discomfort of the spurs &#8211; a single scant degree shy of pain - quickly brought him back under control.&nbsp; �Easy, easy, boy!� she said to calm him and just let him feel the smooth, cold metal to remind him who was mistress and who her usually obedient creature.&nbsp; A spirited beast gave a more thrilling ride, but some doubted that the difference was worth the extra effort.

Caitlin loved to ride too.&nbsp; However, she was less sentimental than Beth.&nbsp; Like Beth, she contributed to PET&#8217;M or �People for the Ethical Treatment of Males,� but her attitude was less syrupy and more utilitarian. She was a student of male psychology.&nbsp; Caitlin prided herself on her high success rate; few males, indeed, failed her training and had to be destroyed or sold off.

�Last one to the old oak is a stinky rotten egg!� Caitlin taunted and ploughed through the waist deep water, laughing.&nbsp; She lifted her knees high as she ran.&nbsp; The lazy ride to Crescent Lake had been pleasant.&nbsp; The women had tied up their mounts and gone for a swim.&nbsp; Lucky and Big Boy stood unsaddled in the shade but hobbled and securely tethered to a sturdy tree, up from the narrow beach.&nbsp; Their saddles lay stacked beside them.&nbsp; Bright sunshine illuminated the brilliant afternoon.

Grinning, Beth screamed her defiance and charged after Caitlin, water dripping from her naked body.&nbsp; �To the old oak and back!&nbsp; And you&#8217;re the rotten egg!�&nbsp; The water streamed from her body as she emerged from the neck-deep water.&nbsp; The bottom was slippery and her footing was precarious as she charged up the bank.&nbsp; The water formed droplets in the neatly trimmed bush that crowned her sex.

Big Boy heard the noise and tried to turn toward the commotion.&nbsp; A short chain hobbled his ankles.&nbsp; His lead was tied to a sturdy tree branch and he could not turn his head far enough to see very much.&nbsp; He could turn only so far to see Lucky standing hobbled beside him.&nbsp; Lucky also had heard the noise.&nbsp;&nbsp; Big Boy pulled against the sturdy branch, the reining rods pressing against his sensitive ear canals, and only then he saw Caitlin and then his mistress, Beth, burst up of the bank and sprint toward him.&nbsp; Both were stark naked.&nbsp; Their wet hair, blonde and brunette, lay plastered to their laughing faces.&nbsp; Water ran from their dripping, very female bodies. 

Once a woman&#8217;s nakedness was termed her shame.&nbsp; Now her nakedness could only be called her glory.&nbsp; Once male genitals symbolized male power and prerogatives.&nbsp; A lone male could intimidate a dozen women simply by threatening to expose his paraphernalia.&nbsp; Now that time is safely in the past and male genitals are known as ineluctable proof of male vulnerability and proximity to the bestial.

Caitlin was the larger of the two women, athletically built and blonde.&nbsp; The sun had lightened her hair a shade or two.&nbsp; Blonde also, but a shade darker, was the patch of golden hair between her thighs.&nbsp; Beth was dark and petite.&nbsp; Her small, wiry frame could scarcely contain her immense will.&nbsp; Their soft breasts jiggled when they ran.&nbsp; Caitlin&#8217;s breasts were larger than Beth&#8217;s.&nbsp; Their shapely legs devoured the distance, but Caitlin&#8217;s height and longer stride gave her an initial advantage.

Caitlin reached Lucky first.&nbsp; In a flash, Beth knelt before Big Boy and worked to him from his hobble.&nbsp; Her bare back, cold and wet, pressed briefly against his bare muscular thighs.&nbsp; Big Boy looked down and the rounded line of her heart-shaped buttocks made him tremble.&nbsp; She was so far beyond him, yet he ached terribly for her.

�Mount!� Caitlin called first.&nbsp; Her one step head start and her longer strides had stood her in good stead.&nbsp; Lucky knelt and Caitlin, holding his lead, leaped on his back.&nbsp; �Up! Up!� she urged.

�Mount!� Beth followed urgently, a fraction of a second later.

His ankles free, Big Boy knelt.&nbsp; His left knee touched the ground.

Beth grabbed a handhold on his bridle, stepped up on his brawny right thigh, and swung her left leg over his neck.&nbsp;&nbsp; She threw herself up on his shoulders.&nbsp; The smooth skin of her tight thighs pressed cold and wet against his shoulders.&nbsp; Her dense thatch of pubic hair scratched the back of his neck.&nbsp; �Up! Up, you motherless bastard!� she yelled fiercely, and then kicked him as hard as she might with the bare heels of her petite feet.&nbsp; �Run!�

Big Boy rose to his feet gracefully and powerfully.&nbsp; He barely felt Beth&#8217;s bare heels when she kicked but he understood her urgency.&nbsp; He loved to run and he loved to please his mistress.&nbsp; Nothing mattered to him as much as Beth&#8217;s praise.

Big Boy ran, though without her spurs or even her hard-heeled boots, he hardly felt her heels.&nbsp; Big Boy ran and Lucky ran beside him with Caitlin up on his broad, strong back.&nbsp; Their fine riding leathers, boots, crops, and spurs lay forgotten on the riverbank.

Beth grabbed hold of his bridle&#8217;s handholds and reining rods.&nbsp; She hunched forward, urging Big Boy to greater speed.&nbsp; Her soft breasts pressed against his head. Big Boy ran.&nbsp; His skin grew hot and slick with perspiration.&nbsp; Lacking crop or spurs, Beth&#8217;s breath seared the his ear as she urged him hoarsely to ever-greater speed.&nbsp; The familiar floral scent of her soap and perfume filled his head with her ineluctably feminine essence.

Big Boy ran.&nbsp; An experienced rider, Beth kept her seat securely and rose and fell with his rhythmic strides.&nbsp; In the corner of his eye, Big Boy could see her rounded breasts bounce as he ran.&nbsp; He imagined how soft they would feel against his cheek.&nbsp; Her nipples and areola were prominent and dark and begged for his lips.

Big Boy ran.&nbsp; He had given his life and strength to Beth&#8217;s service.&nbsp; He held nothing back.&nbsp; Beth&#8217;s naked body pressed against his shoulders and neck.&nbsp; The coarse thatch dark hair that concealed her sex scratched against his sweat slick skin.&nbsp; Beth squeezed his strong neck between her shapely thighs and Big Boy ran.&nbsp; 

Lucky ran beside him stride for stride.&nbsp; His mistress demanded speed and he would not give up so easily.

Beth&#8217;s sex was hot against Big Boy&#8217;s neck.&nbsp; The wetness at this point of contact increased and dribbled down Big Boy&#8217;s muscular back.&nbsp; Beth sighed aloud and pressed herself yet more firmly against him.&nbsp; Big Boy ran.&nbsp; A new element now spiced the clean scent of Beth&#8217;s perfume.&nbsp; The old oak neared.

Caitlin and Lucky reached the old oak first.&nbsp; Big Boy cleared the old oak a stride behind and Beth yanked hard on his left rein, bringing him smartly around the tree.&nbsp; Beth ducked quickly to avoid a low hanging branch as she cut well inside of the taller Caitlin and Lucky.

They turned back to the lake and Big Boy had the lead.&nbsp; The scent of victory gave him added strength.&nbsp; Beth&#8217;s familiar weight was next to no burden.&nbsp; Big Boy lost himself in his motion as his powerful legs pounded the turf.&nbsp; His great chest rose and fell as he breathed deeply.&nbsp; The rhythmic pressure on Big Boy&#8217;s neck began once again.&nbsp; Her graceful legs gripped him ever more tightly, squeezing and releasing.&nbsp; The wetness on his back became more pronounced.&nbsp; Beth&#8217;s verbal encouragements ceased.&nbsp; Her breathing became hoarse and her movements became more urgent.&nbsp; Her scent betrayed her growing arousal.

The lake came into view.&nbsp; Big Boy&#8217;s long stride quickly devoured the distance.&nbsp; Lucky ran valiantly.&nbsp; Breaths came with more difficulty now.&nbsp; Caitlin, like Beth, had neither lash nor spur and still Lucky offered her all his strength.&nbsp; He trailed now by two full paces.&nbsp; He wanted to win.&nbsp; He sensed his mistress&#8217; desire to win and did not want to disappoint her.

Suddenly, Beth jerked and groaned as a first orgasm took her.&nbsp; Inadvertently, she pulled back hard on the reining rods, bringing Big Boy to an abrupt stop right on the bank.&nbsp; Caitlin and Lucky charged past them into the lake.&nbsp; Greedy for pleasure, Beth pressed herself hard against Big Boy, suddenly oblivious to the race and everything else.&nbsp; She trembled visibly as a series of aftershocks gripped her.&nbsp; When she had finished, she was as breathless as her mount.

Big Boy was still breathing hard when Beth caught her breath.&nbsp; She twirled the hairs of his mane affectionately.&nbsp; �Caitlin, we won!�

Caitlin looked up from the water and frowned.&nbsp; �You didn&#8217;t win.&nbsp; The race was to the oak and back &#8211; back into the water where we started!&nbsp; Lucky and I won!&nbsp; You stopped too soon.�

Beth, now fully recovered, feigned outrage.&nbsp; �You cheater!&nbsp; Chicken fight!�&nbsp; She kicked Big Boy hard and urged him into the water.&nbsp; Her small heels did no damage to the large and powerful male.&nbsp; However, he knew her meaning and charged down into the water.

Caitlin turned Lucky sharply to face her assailant.&nbsp; 

The cold water was a shock on Big Boy&#8217;s sweating body as he crashed into the lake but the cold was refreshing despite the chill.&nbsp; He carried Beth deeper into the water, careful to keep his footing on the slippery bottom.&nbsp; The water was quickly chest high.&nbsp; He and Lucky collided.&nbsp; Lucky almost fell but recovered awkwardly while Beth and Caitlin grappled, laughing, on the sturdy shoulders of their large mounts.&nbsp; The women locked hands and tried to shove, pull, or twist each other from their seats, grunting with exertion and laughing at their unladylike laughter and deportment.&nbsp; Everyone was soon soaked.&nbsp; The mounts&#8217; backs were wet and slick.&nbsp; Without proper stirrups, the riders&#8217; perches were treacherous and precarious.

Caitlin&#8217;s greater height gave her better leverage and in time her advantage told.&nbsp; Beth was wrenched from her seat and slid helplessly into the water.&nbsp; Desperately, she held on to Big Boy&#8217;s reins and pulled.&nbsp; The yank on his reining rods compelled him to fall with her.

Big Boy fell and scrambled to regain his feet.

Beth hit the water, laughing and sputtering.&nbsp; She swam a few strokes and brought herself to Big Boy&#8217;s side.&nbsp; Deftly, she clambered back using on his shoulders, finding a foothold for her petite foot in the narrow space between his restrained cock and his belly.

Caitlin prepared a fresh encounter.&nbsp; Beth waved her off, laughing.&nbsp; �Uncle!&nbsp; I give.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s do something else.�

Caitlin led Big Boy and Lucky from the lake and secured their reins to the same sturdy branch.&nbsp; The hobbles were replaced.&nbsp; From the corner of his eye, Big saw Beth spread a blanket on the grass.&nbsp; Once the mounts were secured, Caitlin joined Beth on the blanket just out of Big Boy&#8217;s sight.&nbsp; After the chill of the river, the warm afternoon sunshine was an unalloyed pleasure.

�Beth, it&#8217;s really been a brilliant day,� Caitlin said.

�You make all my days brilliant, my love,� said Beth.

Big Boy heard no further words exchanged.&nbsp; Hearing impeded by the reining rods, he heard only unintelligible whispers and wordless sighs.&nbsp; He heard the sound of flesh caressing flesh as the two women shared their pleasure.&nbsp; He wondered briefly what Lucky was doing.&nbsp; He himself could see nothing, but he closed his eyes and his mind returned to the run to the oak and back when Beth rode naked on his shoulders and pressed her hungry sex against the base of his neck.&nbsp; Her naked breasts brushed the back of his head as she hunched over. Her sweet breath bathed his ear.&nbsp; Big Boy breathed deeply and sighed.&nbsp; He remembered Beth&#8217;s scent &#8211; a compelling admixture of floral perfume, lotion and her own clean female essence spiced by something else.&nbsp; He inhaled deeply and tried to find Beth&#8217;s scent among the complex scents of the river and the forest.&nbsp; The women&#8217;s moans became more urgent now and Big Boy thought he detected the secret fragrance, the aroma of female lust.

Big Boy was still lost in his reveries when the women, sated with pleasure, stopped and dressed.&nbsp; Beth pulled on her leathers, then her boots and finally adjusted her spurs.&nbsp; She and Caitlin exchanged one last kiss before going to retrieve their mounts.

�Caitlin, look at this!� Beth called.&nbsp; Big Boy opened his eyes.&nbsp; Beth grasped Big Boy&#8217;s erection in her gloved hand.&nbsp; Restrained as he was, Big Boy could do nothing.

�Wow!� said Caitlin.&nbsp; �Let me touch.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why you call him Big Boy &#8211; right?�

Beth smiled.&nbsp; Caitlin&#8217;s hand was larger than Beth&#8217;s, but even she had to stretch her long fingers to encompass Big Boy&#8217;s girth.&nbsp; �He&#8217;s really dirty and disgusting creature, isn&#8217;t he?�&nbsp; She wrinkled up her nose.&nbsp; �They only think about one thing.�

Beth chuckled.&nbsp; �And they never do lose hope.�

�I think it&#8217;s so cruel.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why I had Lucky gelded.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve nothing bad to say about your Big Boy, but intact males are too often lazy, distractible and vicious.�

Caitlin rode Lucky back to the manor house.&nbsp; Beth rode Big Boy at her side.&nbsp; Big Boy&#8217;s erection lasted for some time, to Beth&#8217;s amusement, but eventually subsided when she went vigorously to the lash and spur for a great quarter mile sprint.&nbsp; Lucky, carrying the larger Caitlin was hard pressed to stay even at the end of a long day.&nbsp; Beth&#8217;s petite size finally came to her advantage.
