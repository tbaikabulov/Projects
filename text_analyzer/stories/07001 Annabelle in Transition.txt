Synopsis: Young runaway girl becomes part of an underground organization, where she is trained and tortured to become more of an animal and less of a human 







Chapter 1


Life has a funny way of being really predictable, and we have a funny way of refusing to believe that; thinking that we can change the course of reality by being ourselves. We either believe that we won&#8217;t fall under the stereotypical way of life because we are somewhat different than the rest of the humanity, or we just want to create the same mistakes as others to feel the consequences for ourselves instead of learning from example. I think that I fell under both categories when I ran away from home. I thought that I was somehow different; that I could make it on my own and make a name for myself without suffering the consequences of being a teenage runaway. But I didn&#8217;t know much more than that when I got myself into this whole mess. 
I was living in the perfect suburbia lifestyle with no idea of how the outside world would treat me. Stereotypically, I saw life as a runaway to be a little scary, getting mixed up in hard drugs and a lot of sex. There was the common misconception about young teenage runaways being perfect victims for unsolved rape crimes; who generally fell under the pregnant mothers without husbands, let alone boyfriends to take care of them and their babies.&nbsp; But somewhere deep inside I was confident that everything would be different for me because I was some sort of special person with the ability to fend for myself in the �real world�. With that being said; I wanted to learn from my mistakes; if any, and see what would happen to me before backing down and letting the suburbia life drown me out.
Personally, boredom drove me to my escape from reality. I found myself dazed and dreaming as I would stare out the window. My fingertips would tingle with adrenaline as I would contemplate my departure. I&#8217;d watch the clouds and birds and planes roll by, all moving in the same direction; somewhere far into the distance. But I would be trapped there in my room watching them and waiting to fly away too. The dream would end and I would glance down at the math and biology books lying on the table in my room; my chewed up pencil teetering between my fingers, and the almost blank piece of paper with a small doodle in the right hand corner staring back at me. I resented the perfection; the beautiful life I had, with the four bedroom house my parents had worked so hard for. The gray Honda Civic sitting outside; waiting for me, the pretty roses scattered around the front lawn, looking so decorative next to the car I never had to work for. I believed myself to be one of those people that would appreciate life so much more if I had to work for it, but I guessed everyone hated their lives and wanted the opposite. It&#8217;s was like that saying, �The grass is always greener on the other side.� Yeah, that&#8217;s what I thought, I though that the grass would definitely be greener on the side where I had to work to make it green, and not where it was already green from the day I was born. But it was a fantasy, and fantasies are far from reality, but I figured that out when I chose to experiment anyway.
I don&#8217;t know what pushed me, but one day I just left. It was right after school. The day had started out just the same as any other; I went to school and attended all my classes, turned in all my homework, wrote down all the assignments, met with my friends at the lockers, ate with the same friends at lunch, had a smoke with the same friends after school, got in my car and called it a day.&nbsp; I just drove past the school, my house and the general store, stopped to fuel up the tank and then kept driving. I drove past the state border, into the next state, which was Nevada and finally stopped at a motel to get some sleep.
When I woke up the next morning my daze had finally ended. It felt like I was breathing fresh air again and as I walked out of the motel to have a cigarette and look over the town I had landed in, I realized that I had found my new home. The town was far from perfect and that was the way I liked it. It was the generic forgotten town with the under constructed road ways, stop signs instead of stop lights, and a couple small businesses. Instead of taking my car around town, I just walked down the stairs and onto the street. I walked onto Main Street and spotted a help wanted sign. This all seemed to be too easy, I was getting a fresh start and that meant I could be whoever I wanted to be.
�Hello?� I said shyly as I entered the store. 
The bell jingled lightly as the door opened and closed. Inside sat an old store full of nothing but junk. I thought it was an antique store and although I wasn&#8217;t familiar with antiques, I felt the urge to work there. It had a homely smell to it, like old people, and I don&#8217;t know if old people smell homely, but it reminded me of my grandmother, and that reminded me of the only thing I knew close to being homely. The whole store was filled with dust; you could see it trying to settle uneasily through the sunlight streaking past the windows. All ceased to have time here, and in a way I liked that. An elderly woman made her way out of the back room. She had fluffy, curly hair. I wanted to touch it; it had an illusion of being very soft and fun to play with but I thought that it probably had hairspray in it and wasn&#8217;t soft at all; touching it would prove me right or wrong. Just like any other little old lady, she had reading glasses on and a book in hand. She wore whatever she thought was comfortable, and I liked that about her. She didn&#8217;t seem to mind life very much, I didn&#8217;t either and I think that in the back of her mind she already found that similarity between us.
�Hi there, what can I help you with today?� she asked kindly.
�I don&#8217;t know how to say this without it coming out strange, but I&#8217;m new in town; I just got here yesterday. I don&#8217;t really have a place to stay or a job and I just need to start over again. I noticed that sign outside and if you could just let me have a chance. I mean, I know there are plenty of other people out there that could probably do this job so much better than me. But I need a job and you seem like a great person and I just need to have money to get by somehow so I was wondering if I could possibly get an application or something,� I muttered for a minute, then paused to think things over.
�I&#8217;m sorry; my name is Annabelle, Anny. I&#8217;m sorry can I get your name?� I asked and stuck out my hand to shake hers. 
She seemed surprised and jerked slightly at the gesture, then laughed and shook my hand.
�Frankie, well, that&#8217;s what they call me around here. My real name is too old,� she laughed.
�Okay, Frankie, I just want you to know that I don&#8217;t really talk this much, I&#8217;m just nervous, that&#8217;s all, and I have so much to say. I feel like you don&#8217;t even know me and I just can&#8217;t see how you could know anything about me in such a small period of time, so I&#8217;m trying to tell you everything really fast so you would hire me; so that I would have some money to live around here.�
�Don&#8217;t worry, why don&#8217;t you come in tomorrow and we can get started,� she smiled.
�What? Um, does that mean I&#8217;m hired or that you&#8217;ll consider or that you want another interview tomorrow or something?� 
�Have you ever had a job before, dear?�
�Well, there was this one time that I worked at the mall for like three weeks, but that didn&#8217;t really turn out because my friend got me that job and I didn&#8217;t really like it too much, uh, I guess that you be a no,� I stopped myself.
�Well, things work pretty easy around here; you come in tomorrow, about the same time. Fill out some paper work and I&#8217;ll tell you all about your new job.�
�That&#8217;s it? Okay, I can do that! Yep, I&#8217;ll be here tomorrow, same time and that&#8217;s it I guess. Do you need me to bring anything?�
�Just your id and social security number if you don&#8217;t have it,� she said.
�Okay, thank you. Thank you so much!� I just got so excited I leaned forward and hugged her. She seemed surprised at first but I think she liked the way I was so jumpy. 
I left the store as an older man was making his way in, he held the door open for me as I made my way out and went skipping down the street. For the first time since god knows when I felt like I had earned something all by myself. My mind worked so differently in that reality though, and as I played the scenario over in my head I was really disappointed about the way I had acted in front of Frankie. I just wanted her to know I was an intellectual being with thoughts and dreams and I thought that I came off rather dump and ditsy. But something had worked, we made a connection and I got a job just like that.
The rest of the day was spent exploring the town and I spent the night at the motel again. Now that I was settled I wanted to make sure that my parents wouldn&#8217;t be able to find me. I threw out my cell phone and drove the car out about an hour from town. Then I took out my saving and left the car at a parking lot, taking the bus back to town. If I was going to make it on my own I decided to buy my own car and pay my own insurance when I turned eighteen. But that was another year and a half down the road so I would just walk until then. When everything was settled I felt like I could rest easy and it didn&#8217;t take long for the following day to come up. 
I was ready to go and when I came to the store Frankie was already waiting for me. It seemed to me like she was always busy with something, first it was the book and now it was a sandwich in her hands. She smiled with a mouth full, cleaned up and then offered me a seat. She told me about my new job and my responsibilities at the store. It was more than I could ask for; a small shop easily owned and controlled by one person. But she was tired of working and didn&#8217;t need the job. She said she was too old and wanted to focus on other things outside of work. She said she could only pay me minimum wage, but I agreed to it eagerly. 
My first couple of weeks was spent training and getting to know the customers. Everyone in the town was old, or maybe I just thought that because I worked at an antique store. I didn&#8217;t meet anyone my age and I didn&#8217;t make any friends, but that wasn&#8217;t a problem for me, I didn&#8217;t really want friends. Frankie was a great person and she was my friend even though she was much older than me. After those few initial weeks, we really got to liking each other. I admitted to her that I was staying at a motel and she gladly offered a place for me to live; since I wasn&#8217;t making enough money to afford a place of my own.
My life was going too well, everything had worked out just like I dreamed it to be. Frankie had let me stay at her home and work just enough to make some extra money. I really respected that woman and she liked me, mostly because I kept the house clean in exchange for rent. She let me have a small room on the second floor; it was lightly furnished and smelled a little like mold, but I felt at home and I felt like I had finally earned my keep. I did get lonely sometimes because the house was somewhat stranded. Frankie liked to stay up at the apartment above the store; she said that it made her feel more safe and in tune with the others in the town, but she had inherited the house I was staying at from her parents and since she rarely stayed there she had no use for it and that&#8217;s how I wound up living there. Frankie didn&#8217;t have the heart to sell it and I was happy staying there by myself. She would come by to pick me up for work whenever she needed me or if I called her from the house phone to help me run errands. Life was simple and beautiful. But I think that as soon as I was finally settled, things started to fall apart. And they fell apart very quickly.
I remember the night when everything came to ruin; I was downstairs making some tea and listening to music when the door bell rang. It had been about two months since I had moved into the house and about three since I had run away from home. My perception of life was very na�ve; I had forgotten about my old life so quickly and had least expected anyone outside of Frankie to come visit me, especially that late at night. I quickly made my tea and took the mug with me as I hummed along to the music and made my way to the door. I was already contemplating asking Frankie if she wanted some tea when I answered the door. To my surprise, two men dressed in black suits stood in front of my eyes. I felt my mouth drop open lightly as I took a second to gather my thoughts. One of them was wearing a gray trench coat and hat while the other just had the plain suit on. They both were generally handsome, somewhere in their mid thirties. 
My first instinct was to shut the door; I thought that they were the police and had found my whereabouts after I ran away from home. I wasn&#8217;t ready to go home, to go back to my parents and I wasn&#8217;t about to have Frankie and her kindness become the blame for my mistakes. I dropped the tea to the floor and pushed, but my sudden gesture was not enough; the one with the coat had put his foot in the door. Everything began to spin, I watched as he wrapped his hand around the door through the large crack and tried to peak his head in. I was still pushing from the other side trying to keep them out. There was no more than two inches between us as the door separated our faces. 
�Annabelle Simpson, please let go of the door, we are not here to hurt you, we just want to talk to you,&#8217; he spoke in a low tone.
�No! I&#8217;m not going back home! Just leave me alone! I don&#8217;t care if I&#8217;m underage, I don&#8217;t care what you want! I just want to stay here,� I yelled. 
Tears began to gush from my eyes. My body was giving in as the two men pushed against my weight, to open the door. My foot slipped against the running liquid that was spreading for the broken mug and I finally let the door go. They toppled in, but collected themselves gracefully and shot their eyes in my direction.
�Annabelle, please listen; you can&#8217;t go on living like this, we just want to take you back to your parents, they are so worried about you,� the same voice spoke. 
�No, no, no. Just leave, tell them that you couldn&#8217;t find me or that I&#8217;m dead or something, just get out of here!� 
As I spoke I walked backwards towards the kitchen, they followed me slowly, keeping their eyes closely planted on me. 
�We can&#8217;t t do that, Annabelle. Why don&#8217;t you just calm down and come with us,� he tried to reassure me.
But I wouldn&#8217;t listen; I couldn&#8217;t bare the thought of going back home; I would rather be dead. If fact, being at home would be the closest thing to death and I wasn&#8217;t willing to take that risk. I would at least go down trying, rather than give in so easily. 
I felt the counter in the kitchen hit me from behind. I wrapped my hands behind me and felt it. I knew there were only a couple feet to the screen door outside.
�Listen chick, you either come with us nicely or we&#8217;ll do it for you the hard way,� barked the other one.
I suddenly panicked from his loud outburst and jolted out the door. I tore past it and into the backyard. My eyes couldn&#8217;t adjust to the dark. There was barely any light coming from the windows as I ran around the house and out to the main street. I saw their two dark shapes come running for me. One of them had followed me around the house and the other one ran out the front door. I felt myself losing the battle. This wasn&#8217;t like the movies; where everyone was always witty when they were on the run, conjuring up plans of escape. This was sheer fear and panic. My body was shacking, my mind didn&#8217;t know where to start or what to do; it just kind of took the back seat and turned on the auto pilot. I didn&#8217;t know my neighbors, or even if I had any close enough to run to. I was just racing down the gravel road as fast as my quaky legs could take me. All I could think was that I had already failed. What was I going to do? Hide in the bushes somewhere and hope they wouldn&#8217;t find me, or get in my car and drive? What car? 
My throat began to close up as my eyes started to water. I couldn&#8217;t breathe; all I could feel was the sore pain in my throat, and as I looked behind they were only feet away. I began to slow down and felt one of the men jump me and take me down to the ground. He didn&#8217;t land on me, he just managed to have me fall face first onto the gravel and straddle me from behind. I had created my own defeat; I could barely fight since my body was so worn out from the run. He was sitting on top of me and there was no way I&#8217;d be able to get away now, not that I was even planning on it, I had given up. 
�Hands behind your back,� he ordered.
It was the man who had yelled at me earlier. I despised him. I wanted to make sure he knew I still had a little fight in me. I wriggled my hands away from his grasp and tried to hit him. As I moved my head to get a better view I saw the kinder man just standing and watching, I hoped that he felt bad for me, I think he did. But it wasn&#8217;t enough to help me.
The man holding me down didn&#8217;t find it to difficult to catch my hands. My got one and cuffed it, then the other one and bound it too. He set them down to rest on my back as he leaned over to talk to me.
�You are one crazy girl. Where did you think you were going?� he mocked me.
�Fuck you,� I spit out.
It was strange to hear myself cuss; it wasn&#8217;t very often that I did and I felt childish doing it. But it seemed to work on him and he grabbed me by the neck. He pulled my head up off the ground and arched it back as far as he could. I would feel my throat moving up and down again his large, gloved hand. He leaned closer until I would feel his rough after shadow run against my skin. He was so close I could smell the mix of sweat and cologne on his skin. 
�Actually I think it&#8217;s you that is fucked. You&#8217;ve ever smelt the sweet sent of chloroform; it&#8217;s a classic,� he whispered.
I felt his other hand move up to my immobilized head and press a wet handkerchief against my mouth and nose. I tried to squirm away but he kept a tight grip. Slowly the vapor started to seep in through the shallow breathing. My head began to swim again and I felt so tired. I let my head rest against his strong hands. He kept the handkerchief there for as long as he though necessary and then he let me drop to the ground. 
�Okay, help me out man, we have to get her up and out of here,� he said to his partner and then I was gone.

When I first woke up I thought I was still dreaming. I will clear things up right now and say that I wasn&#8217;t. To an extent it was a tiny preview for my life to come. I felt my body resting heavily against leather; I could tell because my bare, sweaty legs were sticking to it. I when I opened my eyes I was surprised to see nothing, I was obviously blindfolded and I took the time to examine my position. My arms were still tied behind my back, but my legs also were tied, bent at my knee and tied at the same place my hands were. I could feel there was leather back to whatever I was laying on and as we hit a bump I decided that I was in the car with the two men from earlier. As I moved I felt my head resting on a man&#8217;s lap and some strain on my mouth. At that moment I felt like reality had hit again and I started to yell in my defense. The strain against my mouth was some sort of gag and all I could hear was a muffle come from my lips. I started crying again. 
�Good morning sunshine,� said a man. 
It was the man who was holding my head on his lap, it was the same man from earlier, I recognized his voice. To my misfortune it was the angry one. 
�How did you sleep?� he asked as he began to stroke my head.
I cried out in despair. Why did I even try? What was I trying to prove to him? He already had me. 
�Oh, I know you must be so uncomfortable. We only have a few more hours to go. It&#8217;s a pretty long drive. I&#8217;d let you get up and move around a bit but we already spent all this time packing you up. I wish you could see how cute you looked right now; all tied up like a pretty present. Did you want to go back to sleep?�
His voice disgusted me. I just lay there silently ignoring him. I felt him stop petting me and lean forward. I heard a clicking noise and in a moment he was sitting back up again. 
�I&#8217;ll take that as a yes, I&#8217;m going to give you a little shot, so try not too move too much. This is just a minor sedative, you know we can&#8217;t go around and chloroform you all that much; it&#8217;s toxic. But this will make you feel nice and woozy and the rest of the trip will go perfectly for you,� he explained.
I felt a pinch in my arm and then he leaned forward again to put the syringe away.
�It&#8217;ll take a few minutes to kick in. What do you suppose we do in the mean time?�
I muffled a cry again; I didn&#8217;t want to do anything in the mean time. I was already tied up and blindfolded, gagged and being harassed by a crazy man, I just wanted to go back to sleep and pretend it never happened. 
�Well, I wouldn&#8217;t expect you to tell me what you wanted anyway, so I guess I&#8217;ll do the decision making,� he laughed.
I felt him run his hand down my neck and onto one of my breasts. It was the first time that I realized that I wasn&#8217;t wearing any clothes. I shook my head violently but that only made him laugh. He rubbed a nipple and started pulling on it, plucked it a couple times and moved onto the next one. My body reacted against my will. The drugs were beginning to kick in and my muscles were starting to release. I had nothing to concentrate on except for the way he played with my tits. My body quivered and I let out a small moan. I heard him laugh.
�Hey Mick, you wouldn&#8217;t believe this chick, I think she likes it!� he said.
�What do you know, maybe things won&#8217;t be that bad for her,� I heard the other familiar voice say.
�You know its about more than that though,� he argued.
�Yeah, but that&#8217;s a big part of it and it&#8217;s that part that most of those people can&#8217;t live past.�
�That&#8217;s true, that&#8217;s true,&#8217; he said and squeezed my breast.
I felt myself drooling, my eyes shut and I went back to dream land.

The next time I opened my eyes I was staring at a white ceiling. When I looked around I appeared to be in a hospital room. It was small, with a window, rolling stand and chair to my right and two doors to my left. One of them peaked into a bathroom; the other I assumed led outside. Straight in front of me was a sink, mirror and paper towel dispenser. I tried to sit up but was surprised to find that my hands and feet had restraints on them. For some reason I couldn&#8217;t come to terms with the past events and that they were true. I thought that everything was a dream. That maybe my parents had found me and taken me to the hospital, possibly because I was seeing things or because the two men who had taken me and had hurt me and I had been rescued and brought here. But when I felt the restraints on my wrists and ankles I knew that everything was true. The bed was smaller than a twin, but it held me gracefully and the restraints were made of a soft material so they didn&#8217;t bother me too much. I could tell I wasn&#8217;t wearing anything as I ran my fingertips against my thighs. I also felt a catheter tube give off some light pressure as I tried to move. 
It was all very strange, but I felt somewhat safe. Everything smelt fresh and the bright light coming through the window and the white walls made everything seem alright. I had clean sheets and a warm blanket on and had obviously been taken care of for however long I had been there. On my left , sat an IV running into my arm, I didn&#8217;t mind it though and I still felt light headed, either from the shot I had earlier or from whatever they were keeping me on. It didn&#8217;t take long for the door knob to turn and for two people to walk in.
As soon as they saw that I was awake they smiled at me and shut the door behind them. They walked up to the right side of the bed and looked over me. One of them was a man, he had gray hair; looked to be in his late fifties. He wore a mustache and big eyebrows, he had a short stature but his broad shoulders made up for it and completed his shape finely. The thing I liked about him was that he had a warm smile; I guess all doctors would though, especially in my situation. He wore a white lab coat over his slakes and gray dress shirt. The other person with him was a woman; she wore scrubs with dinosaurs on them. She too looked friendly, middle aged and a little over weight. I liked her.
�Hello there. It&#8217;s nice to see you awake. My name is Dr. Anderson, this is Betty; she will be your nurse during your stay at our center.�
�Hello,� I said shyly and smiled.
�Are you feeling alright?� he asked.
�Well I feel fine, I&#8217;m a little dizzy, but that isn&#8217;t the real problem is it? I would like to know where I am and why I&#8217;m here and what&#8217;s wrong with me. Because there&#8217;s something obviously wrong with me if I&#8217;m being tied down. And there were these two men that kidnapped me, did that really happen? Are my parents involved in any of this, where are they? Am I ok?� I blew up. 
Underneath it all I was still a chatty young girl. The doctor grunted and looked down. The nurse nodded and walked out of the room. He pulled up the chair to my bedside and sat down.
�Anna, there&#8217;s no real way to tell you this lightly, but I&#8217;m just going to have to tell you. I&#8217;m going to clear the misconceptions and tell you the exact truth of what is happening to you. There&#8217;s no point in anyone hiding it from you because sooner or later you are to have to face the facts whether you like it or not. Would you like me to tell you the truth?�
I nodded.
�You made a very bad decision to run away from home. When a child of your age; not too young to where we cannot use you and not too old to the point where the government has any expectation of you, you become the perfect subject. Let me try to make this clearer, because you seem to be confused. When someone of your age runs away they become game for just about everyone and a race starts to see who can catch them first. Most people who run away don&#8217;t return because they are kidnapped, not because they have started a new life and achieved anything. What fifteen or sixteen year old can start a life of their own? There is no way. So the race begins for everyone around you to find you and take you. Whether it is a sexual predator, a cult, the government or in some rare cases your parents. You&#8217;re lucky if it&#8217;s your parents, but your parents, Annabelle, did not find you in time. And I am afraid to tell you that they will never see you again.&nbsp; 
Our team specializes in finding runaway and taking them in. But it&#8217;s sad to say that we don&#8217;t just take them in to take care of them, we take them in to create, and how can I say this without making it sound up surd; well, to create them into super humans; precisely for the reason of sport and entertainment.�
�What?� I yelped.
�I know it doesn&#8217;t sound realistic, but it&#8217;s been going on for years. As far as I know we are the only corporation world wide that does this; we have ten centers around the world that provide this service,� he continued.
�But what is it? What happens to me? Why me? How did I become part of this?� I cried.
My fists were clenched as I whined in agony. He had such a calm look on his face, as though he had been in this situation way too many time and felt absolutely no sympathy for the person he was giving this information to.
�Calm down Anna, you can&#8217;t go anywhere, so you might as well try to relax and let me finish my explanation. I will get to all of your questions. I know this might all come to you as a shock but it will make sense in no time.�
I stopped fighting.
�Right now you are located on one of the largest campuses available and are going be taken through a series of procedures, tests and training before you are safely sold and let out. Your notice of a missing person was let out to the national police and our service about two months ago when your parents and local police in your state were not able to locate you. As the search continued we were able find your car and even your cell phone and eventually we found you. The police aren&#8217;t particular about finding missing persons because there have greater issues they must tend to, but we specialize in the field. We tracked you down and finally captured you about two weeks later when we became comfortable with your habits and knew it would be safe to take you without leaving a trace. Your friend was set up to come home and find a variety of traps putting her up for your kidnap and death; such things as your clothes in her garbage, the spilt drink that you dropped and so on. No other traces were left and we don&#8217;t mean to make her faulty but it usually keeps people like her from calling the police because they would automatically blame her. So if she doesn&#8217;t call them, she&#8217;ll be safe right now. Anyway, you were the general age area that we were looking for; from 14 to 17 is what we look for. It&#8217;s old enough to where you can make decision, serve your owner and be easily molded by our system, but it is young enough where the government won&#8217;t particularly miss your absence. You don&#8217;t have a job or career or money and the government only cares about their taxes. 
�This is where the shocking but beautiful truth comes in to play. You might be thinking; this is illegal, how can you do this? But that&#8217;s very easily answered. We are a very large campus and the government is well aware of our existence; we deal with runaways and we pay our taxes. If the runaway is found by anyone else or even worse dead, the government doesn&#8217;t get any money from it. But we respectfully pay taxes for every single resident we have here and when they are bought they have monthly taxed paid for them until day they die. Once they are dead the government is contacted; they stop charging taxes for the person and have the right to contact the family and tell them that their family member had been found deceased. It&#8217;s all very simple. 
�So here&#8217;s the part where it gets tricky and might be a little difficult for you to adjust to. Why do we need you and what do we do to you? This is a well tested and quit easy concept. Over a two week period we put a certain type of hormone and chemical compound into your blood stream. It travels through and filters into your brain chemistry. When the trial is over, your brain creates a new type of wave pattern that is triggered and stimulated my certain thoughts or noises or action that we train you to react to. It is a permanent adjustment, once your brain becomes familiar with the foreign chemical it adjusts to it as if it were part of you all along. Eventually you can even control the stimulation yourself. It becomes as easy as becoming happy or mad. But this is not just a mental thing, your body reacts to it drastically and that is the whole point. When your brain is triggered your body goes into a rapid stage of increased animal power and instinct, logic makes less sense and survival makes more. This gives your owner a chance to feel like they are dealing with more as an animal than a human and it&#8217;s great for entertain in small arenas made for your type of morphed humans. You were a perfect subject; young, athletic, easily capable of manipulation and you set yourself up for this by leaving no trace and doing anything in your power not to be found by the police or your family. 
�Like I said earlier, this is a training ground. You&#8217;re longest stay will only be two weeks to a month depending on your progress. Then you will be bought and your new owner will have the right to use you as he or she sees fit. You do not have a choice in this; expect a life of bondage. Don&#8217;t be too upset though, far worse things could have happened to you. You will have a chance to learn so much and live a curious life from the eyes of a super human. You will never be free because these sorts of operations are top secret, but you can earn your place in whatever household, I&#8217;m sure. But I will warn you that the life expectancy for your type is short. Most of the arena fights are duels to death and I would suggest that you learn everything you can to stay alive once you leave here. That&#8217;s all I can tell you and that&#8217;s all you really need to know. I&#8217;m sorry, but this is your fate,� he said and smiled.
�So that&#8217;s it? I can do nothing?� I said with my dry mouth.
 �I&#8217;m afraid so, the process has already begun. You have seen and heard too much to ever go back to the real world. This is your world. Fend for yourself or die. Maybe you could try to pretend this is how life is for everyone if that makes you feel better,� he suggested and shrugged.
�Really, that&#8217;s it? This is it? There is no way around this? I&#8217;m trapped here? I must be dreaming! You are just going to leave and this will be it? I&#8217;m not going to wake up?�
�You are right,� he said and put the chair back.
�Try to rest up. I would just relax if I were you. Remember that worrying won&#8217;t ever get you anywhere,� he said and walked out the door.
I just lay there absorbing everything he said. I wished I could just roll into a little ball and cry but I was strapped down and I just felt the tears collect and slide down the sides of my face. The nurse came in, but she didn&#8217;t say anything. She just emptied out my catheter, checked my blood pressure and left.
There was nothing I could do but fall back asleep. 
The next time I woke up a tall, skinny man walked into the room. It was already evening outside as far as I could tell. But there was no clock in my room so I didn&#8217;t know what time it really was. He too pulled up the chair and sat himself down.
�Hello Anna, my name is Dr. Cannon and I&#8217;ll be in and out to do some brief sessions with you. I&#8217;m the center&#8217;s psychiatric and I&#8217;m primarily here to listen to you if you want to just talk or cry of tell me if you are feeling any different and would like some help with that. Would you like to have a session tonight?� he asked.
I looked at him for a while and then back at the ceiling. My will to live was quickly fading, after I heard the news from the doctor earlier that day I didn&#8217;t know what to do with myself; a life in bondage; a soon to come death, survival of the fittest; an animal and a human. What would I do, there was nothing to do, I didn&#8217;t want to talk to him or any one else. Besides he looked like he didn&#8217;t enjoy his job very much, I wouldn&#8217;t either if I had to listen to people whine all day about their lives in captivity. So I decided to save him the trouble.
�It looks here like Dr. Anderson had a talk with you earlier about your delicate situation. Would you like to talk about that?� he asked as he examined his clip board.
I turned my head the other way so that the back of it was facing him. 
�I guess that&#8217;s a no. That&#8217;s alright I&#8217;ll come back later. I just want you to know that you can feel safe with me and tell me anything about the way you are feeling. I am only here for your benefit, I am not here to hurt you,� he said and left.
My head was still light and spinning, whatever they were giving me wore me out, and I fell asleep again. I didn&#8217;t know if this was a dream or not, it was hard to decipher the dream world from reality, but as I slept I thought that I woke up from spasms; my body was convulsing and I felt foam coming out of my mouth. I saw the doctor and the nurse next to my bed; suddenly, they were gone. I blinked and they were back again, my body was shaking so badly and I started to vomit. I fell back into sleep. When I woke up everything was exactly as I had left it last when I had seen the physiatrist. I thought it was a dream. But as I felt my wrists and how sore they were under the cuffs, I thought that it was true. 
By the time I was fully awake, I was still half asleep. It was like this daze was constantly over me. I couldn&#8217;t think about anything, I would just stare at the blank walls and listen to my breathing. Sometimes I would cry and sometimes I would let them feed me. Over the following week I was never let out of bed or un-cuffed to my knowledge. People would come in and out regularly. If it wasn&#8217;t the doctors or the nurse it was a nurse assistant, they were always different. They would roll me about the bed, back and forth to change the sheets. Sometimes I would be awake, most of the time I was asleep. Whenever I need to have a bowel movement I would have to wait for someone to come in and assist me with a bed pan. When I was hungry, they would come in and move my bed up to a sitting position, then they would feed me. They would never let me free.
After the first week had come to an end I had adjusted. I felt safe exactly the way I was. The only time I would say anything was when I needed a bed pan, other than that I would stare blankly. The physiatrist came almost every night, but I never spoke to him. He would jot down a couple things and leave. My other doctor never showed up, unless I was it was in one of my dreams, which I doubt were dreams but they felt that way. The dreams came more often as the days progressed. When they happened I would just let them pass because there was nothing else I could do. The nurse had rarely showed up but by the end of the week she was in my room at least a couple hours at a time. They finally rolled a TV in on cart for her to stay amused as she sat with me since we never spoke. I guess she had to keep track of how I acted, but she never had anything to write down on her notepad. 
One evening we were doing the same thing that had become routine only two days prior. She was watching the local cable and I was counting the little specks on the ceiling. The TV bothered me, it only reminded me of the life I could have had if I were free. 
�Do you want to play a game?� she asked.
I looked at her with surprise.
�I mean seriously, you&#8217;ve been here like eight days now and you haven&#8217;t done shit. I could be at home right now, but I&#8217;m stuck here babysitting you. Almost everyone is gone for the night. Promise you won&#8217;t try to run for it if I untie you?� she said with a big smile on her face.
I nodded.
She turned off the TV, pulled off the blanket and unbuckled the straps. I sat up, but felt a rush of dizziness and lay back down again. 
�Careful,� she said.
I sat back up again, turned towards her and crossed my legs. She noticed the smile on my face and laughed a little. I liked her so much. 
�We&#8217;ll play a card game. I know you don&#8217;t really like to talk, and in card games you don&#8217;t really have to,� she said and pulled up the small table by the window. 
She sat it between us and pulled her chair up to it. Then she pulled a stack of cards out of her pocket.
�I always carry these around with me. Sometimes it gets so boring around here. It&#8217;s not like working at a real hospital. Everyone her has the same exact problem, they&#8217;re all so predictable,� she sighed.
�Here, do you know how to play war? I&#8217;ll teach you,� she said and started passing out the cards.
We played for about an hour and she finally got bored. I wasn&#8217;t bored at all, I finally felt somewhat alive, but she said she needed a break and said she&#8217;d be back in five minutes. I nodded and set up a game of solitaire for myself. As soon as she closed the door I fell into the lapse between real life and my dream life. Everything became a blur again. I don&#8217;t know whether it was the medication or me just losing my mind but I sat there for a minute, thought about things and decided I wanted to leave. Like some sort of savage, or a person without much of a mind left I ripped out the IV. Then I looked at my catheter. This one would be tricky, but what did the matter anymore. I knew how those things worked, they were stuck in there for good and I&#8217;d ruin my urinary tract if I tried to rip it out so I just pulled it up to my face and started to chew through the rubber tubing with my canine teeth. They were sharp enough to break the rubber, I pulled the rest and bit of the remains. All I had was a flabby rubber tube dangling in just a minute. I let the rest of the bag drop and watched my urine run down the floor.
Then I just walked out of the room. Outside my door ran a long hall. There were doors on either side just like mine, and an opening with a desk and files. No one was around so I began to walk to the hall. I knew that this was all pointless and that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to escape but I wanted to make my dreams more real. I noticed a small opening in the hall where two women were talking and taking a coffee break. They both had scrubs on; one of them was my nurse but they didn&#8217;t notice me. I kept walking, but I just passed more residential room. So at the end of the hall I took the stairs down and found myself in another hall, this one had its door more spread out and they were metal, unlike the ones upstairs which were just wood.
I went into the first one that was open. It led me to a little room with a board of knobs and a window in front of me. There was only enough room for about four people comfortably. I looked out the window into a white room. At the far end wall in front of me sat a little girl. She looked no older than fourteen, I empathized with her but I had forgotten than I was only a few years older than her. She was seated on the ground with her back pressed against the wall, she was as naked like I was, and her wrists were chained to the wall. I think she was sleeping as I watched her. 
All I wanted to do was set her free, I wanted to get her out of those chains and take her away with me wherever we were going to go. I tried to open the door that led into the white room but it was locked. I looked at the board of button and knobs but nothing indicated an opening to the door. The closest thing I could guess was a black round button and I pressed hoping for the best. But Instead of the door opening a quiet continuous ringing began. It wasn&#8217;t loud enough to bother anyone outside of the room, but the girl woke up instantaneously. She looked straight at me and started to convulse. I felt that the noise was bothering her so I tried to press the button again to turn it off but it wouldn&#8217;t do it. I turned it one way or the other but it only made it louder or quieter. There was no way to just plainly turn it off. 
The girl began crying, she tried to press her hands against her ears but the chains wouldn&#8217;t let her reach. She started pulling at them but she obviously wasn&#8217;t strong enough. I watched in pure fascination as she started to morph. Her back hunched in a bit and the shaking stopped, she looked up at me but this time her eyes were glazed over, her teeth had also grown. They were so large she couldn&#8217;t close her mouth. I pressed my face against the glass as I tried to see closer. The front four stayed the same but the canines on bottom and top, along with the rest of her back teeth grew at least five times their normal size. Her nails turned to talons before my eyes and her skin turned a darker brown. She bulked up with more muscle with every heavy breath she took and suddenly she jerked at the chains again. I jumped back in surprise but I didn&#8217;t run away. I just watched. It was hypnotizing how strange and somewhat beautiful she became in an animalistic sort of way. I felt safe behind my glass and I watched her as she beat vigorously against the chains.
But in an instant all of that changed as she managed to break free. The chain links snapped on either side and left the cuffs dangling on her wrists. She was not satisfied with her victory; instead, she ran towards me. I didn&#8217;t even react until she hit her fists against the glass. By then I was pressed up against the back of the room as much as possible. I had the opportunity to run but I was entranced and I still couldn&#8217;t believe that she would be able to make it through the glass. But she did make it, she beat against it until if finally broke and then she tore it out of the way, only to find me on the other side. She paused, but the noise was still haunting her and she couldn&#8217;t help herself. She bent over and ran her huge hands against her face leaving scratches behind. But I didn&#8217;t turn off the noise so she looked back up at me and jumped for my throat.
It all happened so quickly I barely knew what really went on. I saw her flying towards me, but then everything started shaking around me and she was in some sort of standstill. I could hear sirens going off somewhere. She was slowly getting closer and when she finally reached me I grabbed her by the wrists. Her eyes were fully dilated; I remember that. And I could hear her heart beating in sync with mine. But everything was moving quite slowly for me and too fast for her. As she tried to get her way out of my grip I looked down to see that my hands had turned into ones just like hers. I picked up her whole body by the wrists and threw her to the floor. Then I leaped onto her and started slashing her across the face. I watched this all happen through my eyes but the actions were not directed by me. Suddenly pure rage came flushing over me and I dove for her neck. I tore out a mouth full and saw the blood start gushing out. But I wasn&#8217;t satisfied because I could still hear he heart beat so I continued to dig deeper into her neck until the heartbeat finally ceased to exist. 
When she was finally dead I lay my head on her chest and watched as her body turned back to a human. She was such and innocent beautiful girl, completely possessed by some sort of animal and she tried to stop herself from hurting me but she couldn&#8217;t because I wouldn&#8217;t help her. And my instincts had kicked in and something inside of me wouldn&#8217;t stop until she was dead. As she lay there her small body looked so mutilated; the raw gash in her neck and the scratches across her face made me go numb in fear and regret. I sat up against the wall and pressed my knees up against my chest. I didn&#8217;t want to believe any of this was real anymore. The broken chains, shattered window and a murdered girl gave way to the fact that this was all real. I closed my eyes and listened to the sirens and to the quiet ringing that had started all of this in the first place. 
It didn&#8217;t take long for the security guards to find me. They came in with guns but were surprised to find two little girls instead of monsters. They told me to stand up and put my hands behind my back. I did exactly as they ordered me to do. Then they cuffed me and led me out of the room. They didn&#8217;t take me back upstairs; instead they led me down the same hall. As we passed the main opening I saw a long office counter and chairs and also a man with a white lab coat and another in a gray suit talking. The man in the suit looked up at me as I passed by. I kept eye contact with him until I had to let go because I was moving and he was not. But as soon as I lost the contact I jerked by head back and yelled, �Help me! Please sir!� 
He didn&#8217;t reply and I hung my head low in disappointment. Towards the end of the hall we entered a metal door to my left. Inside it looked simple and cold. The walls, floor and ceiling were all concrete, there was a large mental chair set up with a head rest and a foot rest. Straps were attached to it anywhere possible. There were no windows, in fact there was nothing else in the room except for a door out and another leading to a bathroom. They took me inside the bathroom and shoved me in the shower stall. One of them pulled out the shower head and hosed me down with it until all the blood was gone. Then the other opened a locked cabinet under the sink and pulled out some scissors and automatic razor. I didn&#8217;t move as he cut and shaved all of my hair. Then the other one showered the hair off me and dried me off when he turned off the water. There were no mirrors in the bathroom.
They led me over to the chair in the center of the room and sat me down. It wasn&#8217;t seated on four legs; instead it was concreted to the ground by a large metal pole. I didn&#8217;t fight them as they strapped in my feet, then my thighs, waist, wrists, upper arms and neck.
�Am I going to die here?� I asked.
�No,� they both said in sync and then they left after turning off the bathroom light. 
I heard a lock on the door click and stared at the room as it became too quiet. There was no light. They had diminished it after turned off the bathroom light and closed the main door. I was sitting in darkness. The chair was tilted back enough to the point where my head was resting on the head rest comfortably and my feet were up a little in the air. I wasn&#8217;t too afraid of the dark and tried to fall asleep. My catheter was still inside of me. I could feel small streams of urine run onto the metal chair and drip onto the floor. 
About an hour later I was still awake. Too much had happened and it left me restless. A ringing started playing out from the ceiling vents. It was the same tune that had been played when the girl turned into a monster. I had a feeling that I held the same fate. It didn&#8217;t take long for the noise to start piercing me ears. There was no way to escape it, I couldn&#8217;t cover my ears or even move my head; I just had to listen to it. And I began to feel my body shaking. I knew that I was becoming a monster again and I tried to control myself but there was no way. I started making shapes out in the darkness. I could see the walls and doors and even the ceiling vents. I could see low enough to where my nails were turning into claws and my breathing became deeper. The noise became louder and I was eager to find a way to stop it. 
Time was slow before all of this but it was moving slower still as everything became a blur. I watched my feet and legs shake in slow motion; their actions leaving behind a strand of motion. My stomach felt sick and I wanted to vomit. I was convulsing so violently the back of my head started beating against the metal head rest. 
I fainted in a few minutes, only to wake up and find myself in the same state I was before. I couldn&#8217;t tell how much time had passed, but I woke up again when my doctor and two men entered the room.
�Did you have a pleasant night?� he laughed.
I couldn&#8217;t even move; my body felt limp and dead. I just stared at the ceiling. 
�We have some more work to do with you today,� he said as the men started unbuckling me.
The doctor stepped forward when they were done and took a moment to pull out the remains of the catheter. They rolled in a wheelchair and moved me into it. After that we went down the hall and entered a room that had looked like one from the night before. As far as I could tell it was already mid day. From the windows in the hall it was bright and sunny outside. But they brought me into a windowless room with white walls. They rolled the wheelchair into the center and closed the door on their way out. In front of me sat a large mirror. It was just like the room from the night before. I knew they were all watching me from the other side. But instead of trying to pretend I could see them I just stared at myself.
It was the first time I had seen my reflection since I had arrived at the center. I was just a corpse sitting in a wheelchair. I saw that I had lost a dramatic amount of weight and my bones were easier to see. My skin was a yellow color and I had dark circles under my eyes. My head was just a pale remain from the beautiful long hair that used to sit there and I was disgusted with myself. 
The ringing noise soon came. I couldn&#8217;t help the reaction, I knew it was coming and I accepted it. But I was so weak from the night before that when I turned into an animal I just rose out of my chair and fell face first to the floor. I felt my body shake against my will but I took all of it in and I wondered how long they would continue to torture me. The noise didn&#8217;t disappear and I decided that the most I could do was to come to a realization that I was in charge of myself and that these evil people couldn&#8217;t manipulate me. I listened to my breathing and took in my atmosphere; the noise was nothing but a noise. In reaction to my thoughts my body went back to normal. I felt my soft skin push against the cold floor and I decided to stand up with the last of my strength. 

Chapter 2


So there I stood, staring at myself in the mirror; a little, gangly girl with nothing to lose or gain. I couldn&#8217;t hear the noise anymore, I just looked at myself and finally I smiled. Somewhere deep inside of me there was pride, that I could so easily over come the circumstance when others could not.
The door opened and two men came in. One was a security guard and the other was the man I had seen last night, the same one that I had asked to help me. We watched each other for a while. I kept my smile on and went back and forth between the security guard and the other man. 
I don&#8217;t know what came over me, but all of a sudden I felt the urge to kill again. It was the same feeling I had the night before. I started to hear their hearts beating. The security man made me furious, he was one of the men who had kept me here and let all of this happen to me. I needed to show that I wasn&#8217;t weak and that if they were going to turn me into a monster they would have to suffer the consequences. He didn&#8217;t even see it coming. I don&#8217;t even think I had fully developed into an animal yet. I just jumped towards him and pressed him against the wall. Once I felt my teeth grown in I bit at his neck. I spit out the chunk that I managed to snag and went for his screaming face. I tore off his nose and gouged out his eyes. Then I threw him to the floor and cut open his stomach. I pulled out some insides and splashed them against the walls. His heart beat stopped and I looked up at the other man. He was shacking but not scared enough to run. He was as close as possible to the door but he apparently didn&#8217;t want to miss the action. I knew there were others on the opposite side of the mirror just watching; too afraid to come and help.
�I&#8217;m sorry. I didn&#8217;t mean to do that,� I said as my body began to become normal again.
�It&#8217;ll alright,� he said.
I could tell he had a loss for words. The others came in. There were at least five of them; more security guards and doctors and another man in a suit. They approached me and I turned my back to them and put hand behind to have them cuffed.
�Why did you do that?� my doctor asked once I was safe to approach.
I didn&#8217;t answer him, I never talked to him. He waved for another person to come forth. It was that the man from earlier.
�What&#8217;s your name girl?� he asked.
�Annabelle,� I replied.
�Why did you do that, Anna?�
�I want you to save me! I know who you are; I know you are one of those men that the doctor told me about. The men that buy us,� I said.
�I&#8217;m not here to buy anyone. And what makes you think that I can save you?�
�I know you are, don&#8217;t lie to me! And you have to save me because I spared your life!� I argued.
�Just because you are stronger than me or more prone to kill when you turn into a monster, doesn&#8217;t automatically mean that you would have killed me given the chance. I deal with animals like you everyday! What makes you any better than the other people here? If I were to buy anyone it wouldn&#8217;t be you. You&#8217;re weak!� he shrugged and walked towards the door.
�Please!� I begged.
�Anna, you don&#8217;t want me as your master; I&#8217;m a bad man. I see you as an animal; livestock. You wouldn&#8217;t make it where I would take you,� he warned.
�I will. You can&#8217;t leave me here! I can&#8217;t deal with these people. I&#8217;ll die here. I&#8217;ll do anything, I promise I&#8217;ll do anything for you,� I cried and fell to my knees.
�Why are you saying this?�
�Because, because I&#8217;m scared,� I cried with my head lying against the concrete ground.
�It won&#8217;t be any easier where I&#8217;m going to take you. Why would you want to do that to yourself? Better yet; why would I want to waste my time on you?�
�Because I trust you; I trusted you from the minute I saw you and asked you to help me right there and then,� I said.
�That&#8217;s all I wanted to here. Just pack here up and truck her over to my estate,� he said and opened the door.
My doctor ran up to him and stopped him.
�Sir that is not a wise choice; she hasn&#8217;t been trained at all. She has been in isolation one day! One day is not enough, she should be here at least another two weeks!� he argued.
�I don&#8217;t care pack her up,� he said.
�We simply can&#8217;t do that. Without the proper training she won&#8217;t be applicable for the refund we offer. She obviously hasn&#8217;t been broken. You just witnessed a man being murdered on her behalf. It is a safety violation for us, the state and you. We cannot be responsible for the injury you, who is one of our best costumers, might face because of this creature,� he pleaded.
�Doctor, I simply don&#8217;t care for anymore of this small talk. If I am one of your best customers you should have enough faith in me that I can manage with the goods that I purchase from you. For all the years I have worked with your company I have never returned an animal. This won&#8217;t be any different; in fact, don&#8217;t even offer the return policy since you haven&#8217;t trained her. I&#8217;m glad she&#8217;s not broken. I&#8217;ll find great enjoyment in doing that myself. Just make sure she arrives safely and that the paperwork is shipped to me directly,� he ordered and left.
�Well you heard him,� the doctor sighed.
I could tell he was relieved. It was obvious that I had caused more problems for him than necessary and he was glad to get rid of me without the consequences of ever having me returned. I had already managed to escape from my room and cause two casualties in less then 24 hours; I would be glad to get ride of me too and was happy to leave.
 Honestly, I didn&#8217;t know what to expect. I thought that the worst had already passes, but little did I know that it had just begun. I thought that the man was just arguing with me to get me off his back. But I would rather have one man in charge of me than a whole clinic full of idiots. And I did trust him, he seemed to have a connection with me and although he was much older I saw him as a fatherly figure and couldn&#8217;t see why he would call himself a �bad man�.
They pulled me up from the floor and sat me back on the wheel chair. We rode down the hall with the two doctors and a couple security guards, who were definitely on the guard now that they knew what I was capable of. 
We took an elevator down from the main floor and got out to the loading floor; downstairs at the back of the building. There was a medium sized cargo truck that had the back door open for loading and a couple cages already settled inside. A forklift rolled up carrying a cage big enough to fit me sitting down. It was set on the ground and I was shuffled into it. They took of the cuffs and asked me to put my hands up, over and behind my head once I was seated inside. Then they tied them to the netted cage ceiling. It wasn&#8217;t all that bad; my arms just hung loosely with the elbows poking out on either side of my face. After that they locked up the cage and the forklift took me over to the truck. The security men guided the cage inside and pushed it up against the far wall. I saw two other cages in front of me. It looked like there was only room for one more next to me. 
In a minute some one slide the door closed and it was pitch black.
�Who are you?� a quiet, quaky voice asked.
�Are you talking to me?� I asked.
�Yes, yes, you.�
�My name is Anna, what&#8217;s yours?�
�They started calling me Tick around here, but I don&#8217;t know if my new master will call me that or if you want to call me something else,� she said.
�Why do they call you Tick?�
�I don&#8217;t know. It seems they give everyone nick names around here, I think it helps the trainers believe that you aren&#8217;t human; like they are referring to as an animal of pet. They give out pet names, why don&#8217;t you have one?�
�I&#8217;ve only been here for a week.�
�I&#8217;ve been here for at least a month. I not really sure, I started losing track of day after the training began. You see, they don&#8217;t have clocks or even windows in the rooms so after a while you don&#8217;t know how many days you&#8217;ve been there. I started counting by the amount of times they&#8217;d bring me food, but I lost track of that because they started using that as a weapon against me. You should be glad that you were here for so little. Why are you leaving so quickly?�
�I made a deal with the guy that bought me to have him train me instead,� I said.
�Oh no,� the girl sighed.
�What?�
�I wouldn&#8217;t do that if I was you, but I guess it&#8217;s too late. These people are experts, they have been doing this forever and they have the proper training. What will this weirdo do to you? He has no one watching him or stopping him in anyway from doing whatever the hell he wants to do to you,� she said.
�I don&#8217;t know; I wasn&#8217;t thinking,� I mumbled.
�Why?�
�I just got scared; I was put in one of those rooms without clocks or windows and I didn&#8217;t want to be there anymore,� I whined.
�No one does, but it&#8217;s always better to leave these kinds of things to an expert,� she said.
�Yeah, well what am I supposed to do about that now?� I barked.
The door suddenly started moving up again and we shut up when it opened. They put another cage in next to me. A man crawled inside the truck and strapped in all the cages. I noticed that no one looked at him except for me. When he noticed that I was staring at him he smiled and bent over my cage.
�Don&#8217;t you know better?� he said and laughed.
�I don&#8217;t know anything,� I answered and all of the girls looked at me sharply.
�Hah, I guess where you&#8217;re going, you&#8217;re going to learn pretty damn quickly,� he said and strapped in my cage.
He checked everything for stability and jumped out of the backside of the truck. Then he shut the door for good and locked it, but not before giving me a little smile and a wink.
All was silent again and we could here the truck engine start up. None of us talked until we knew that we were safely on the road. Tick was the first to cut in a few words.
�Oh man, like I was saying; you&#8217;re in for a trip. This sicko is going to mess you up. I took all this bullshit training but I still know who I am. I mean it&#8217;s possible to be who you are after this is all said and done; you just have to be careful and play the system. But you got yourself in real shit; who knows what this guy is going to want with you,� she said.
�I don&#8217;t want to talk about this anymore. What&#8217;s your name?� I asked the girl next to Tick.
No reply.
�What&#8217;s her deal?�
�She doesn&#8217;t talk; I know some stuff about her. After you&#8217;ve been in training you start to really listen. I heard a lot of shit and I&#8217;ve seen it too,� she said.
�What&#8217;s your name,� I turned my head and asked the girl next to me.
Her cage rattled in surprise.
�Red,� she said softly.
�Why do they call you that?&#8217; I asked.
�I don&#8217;t know.�
�Do you know why she doesn&#8217;t talk?� Tick asked.
�I can talk,� Red argued.
�Not you. This girl; next to me, her name is Sammy. I know because she shook her head when the truck was open. I was sitting in here for a couple hours before you two came and she finally agreed to one of the names. I&#8217;ve heard of a couple girls. Sammy&#8217;s new owner put a price on her before her training began and made specific rules for her. She&#8217;s wasn&#8217;t allowed to talk. And I mean; I would talk if I was her when no one was around, but they fucking get to you after a month of beating down on the fact that you can&#8217;t talk. So I can see where she&#8217;s traumatized from that and can&#8217;t even talk around us,� Tick explained.
The girl started crying.
�What the heck, why do you even have to say anything. She&#8217;s sensitive,� I got frustrated.
�I rant tack,� we heard a muffled sound come from her lips. 
It sounded like she was biting on her tongue.
�You can&#8217;t talk?� We both guessed.
�Why happened to you?� Tick asked; when we were all too nervous to.
�Ton caw,� she said.
Tick guessed right away what she meant.
�Oh god! Are you fucking serious? They cut off your fucking tongue?� she screamed!
The girl started crying. No doubt she was embarrassed and scared, but Tick always made the most awful obvious statements. There was a long silence after that. 
�We&#8217;re all going to die,� Red said.
�No duh, genius; we all die eventually,� Tick replied.
�It&#8217;s not like that; we are like cows going to the slaughter, we are all going to die very soon,� she said.
�Fuck you,� Tick yelled.
�You can talk all you want but you won&#8217;t talk your way out of this one. Or maybe if you talk enough you might get your tongue cut out like the other one,� she threatened.
You could tell that the girl next to Tick had finally calmed down and as soon as Red spoke up she started weeping again.
�Oh shut up, I guess they can take away your words but there&#8217;s no way to get ride of that awful voice,� she joked wickedly.
�You bitch! What&#8217;s your problem?� Tick cried.
�I don&#8217;t have a problem, I&#8217;m just being honest. You&#8217;re a jabber mouth and that&#8217;s definitely not going to get you anywhere. She should have kept quiet when they told her to be quiet during the training and she wouldn&#8217;t have gotten her tongue cut out and you over here made to stupidest decision of all. I heard you two talking, that jabber mouth does know one thing; you were better off training in the center than at the mercy of your new master,� she said.
I felt me heart sink.
�Let&#8217;s not talk anymore,� I suggested.
Everyone agreed. Even Tick didn&#8217;t say a word for the rest of the trip.
They loaded Tick off first. I felt good that she was gone. I knew she had so much more to say, heck we all had a lot to say, but she made things weird between us and I was happy because after she left there was peace.
�I like you. You seem to have your head on straight. I just wanted to wish you luck. But I also wanted to remind you that we are living in a different world now where you have to kill to survive. You have to be willing to kill or you will be killed. I hope we never meet again, because if we do we will most likely have to fight to the death,� Red said to me after Tick left.
�So what do we have to look forward to? What are we living for if all of our freedom and hope for the future is crushed?� I asked.
 �I&#8217;m living for pride. I&#8217;m going to be a warrior. If I have to die it better be one hell of a fight. During training I just told myself that. I told myself that was being trained, like in the army or something, to be a greater being, to fight for something and to be superior,� she said.
�How do you know you have achieved that greatness?�
�I think it&#8217;s a feeling,� she said.
�I don&#8217;t feel like that when I kill. I&#8217;m just afraid, and some sort of rage takes over,� I explained.
�You have killed?�
�Two people,� I said.
�Because you were afraid?� she finished.
�I don&#8217;t know how to explain it. I guess it all started when I ran away from home. I was so sick of my normal perfect life. That everything was already preplanned and set up for me and that I didn&#8217;t have to work for a thing in my life. I just wanted the opportunity to be something more and to live,� I said.
�Then you are just contradicting yourself because this is exactly what you were asking for. You can not be afraid of the untold, if you are than you are constantly living your old life and wasn&#8217;t that what you were running away from?�
�Your right, but I can&#8217;t help the way I feel. I can&#8217;t help being afraid,� I said.
�Then embrace it,� she said.
We came to a stop and she was loaded off. Those were the last words I heard from her, but they melted into my heart and stayed there. I waved goodbye to her when she got carried away. She was very beautiful.
The trip felt so much longer when I was alone. I wasn&#8217;t exactly alone but the other girl wouldn&#8217;t talk and I didn&#8217;t want to upset her by trying to start some sort of conversation. I didn&#8217;t really feel like a caged animal until I finally had to use the restroom and just ended up peeing on the floor since there was nothing else I could do. It was alright though because it just seeped through the netting and onto the floor and I didn&#8217;t even think about it for a while.
Finally my destination came. It was already night time when the truck arrived. The man that owned me, the two truckers and two servants of the house all came out to aid me. They took me out of the cage and led me inside the house. It was interesting to see how little they trusted me and how many people were are revolved around making sure one girl wouldn&#8217;t run off or fight. When they brought me inside they untied my hands and left me standing in front of the man alone.
�My name is Alfred, but you are not allowed to call me that. You can only refer to me as Master or Sir from now on. I&#8217;m sorry about the inconvenient ride here. If you behave you will be welcome to stay at my home and will never have to take one of those rides again.�
I watched as he dug into his pant pocket and pulled out four metal bracelets. He snapped each one closed around my wrists and on my ankles.
�These are purely for security reasons. We have never had anyone run away from this estate and I don&#8217;t plan for any mistakes in the future. These are magnetized cuffs and although they look small and delicate they are very powerful. As soon as I closed them they have been securely installed. It is humanly impossible to remove them. It would take 400 pounds of pressure to pull them apart and they are nearly unbreakable as well.&nbsp; If you try to run there are lasers across the courtyard in every direction. If you cross one with the bracelets on, they will activate and link onto each other causing an automatic bondage for you and no means of escape. So don&#8217;t try it.�
I nodded.
�Here are a few simple rules of the house before we get started. You are not a human, you are not a fighting machine; you are nothing. You are just a pet; a project that I have placed upon myself for entertainment purposes. This being said; you are below anyone else&#8217;s stature in this household. You will obey the rules I command you, you will fall under my wife&#8217;s rules, my fighters&#8217; rules, my servants rules; and anyone that asks anything of you. If you do not, this will all get back to me and you will be severely punished and they will also have the right to punish you. Understood?�
�I&#8217;m not going to fight?�
�I didn&#8217;t bring you here to be a fighter, if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re asking. I brought you here for the pure purpose of entertaining my household in whichever way they please.�
�I understand,� I said.
He then led me down the hall. He had a grand house with tall ceilings and marble floors, and one of those large staircases that weaved around a little. But we didn&#8217;t go up the stairs case we went through the kitchen, passed the servants wing and into a small room, a dark room. No clocks and no windows; just like I had expected. There was an old twin mattress on one side against the wall held by a bared bed frame, and a toilet and sink on the other. And it wouldn&#8217;t have served right as my room if it didn&#8217;t have chains hanging from the ceiling and others attached to the wall. 
�There is no difference between day and night here. So try to sleep whenever you get the chance, whether you think it is night or day. For right now I will be the only one working with you. When your training is complete you will be allowed to go upstairs if you are called by someone. Now rest,� he said and left. 
I relieved myself and then I washed my face. I sat on the mattress and started at the chains. My body was tired, my mind was even more so. Therefore, I did exactly what he asked to do and went to bed. 
He woke me up. I felt him tying one of my wrists up to the bed frame as I opened my eyes. He looked handsome; he had a well fitted suit on like he was ready to go somewhere, but he had to take care of me first. He tied my other wrist up as well and they sat together in the center of the bed frame above my head. Then he spread out my legs and attached them to each corner of the bed frame at the foot of the bed.
�Lesson one; I have the right to do with you as I please. The sooner you learn to accept this, the better. And even far better than that; would be to enjoy it.�
After he had said this, he ran his hand from my chest down to one of my feet. 
�Never ever argue with the person using you or even complain. If you do you will be punished. It might be hard at first because of your human instincts, but I&#8217;m sure you will learn quickly. As I mentioned earlier you are only allowed call me Master or Sir for now on, until otherwise instructed you will only speak when you are spoken to, and during our training the only reply you are permitted to give is a yes or no with a reference to me as a Master or Sir,� he said.
�Let&#8217;s get started then. You may not understand some of the things I am going to do to you and that is alright, as long as you do not complain about them. If you do you will be punished,� he said.
I followed him with my eyes as he reached down and pulled out something from a cardboard box he had brought with him. It was a small leather paddle. He rose over me and started spanking my breasts with it. At first, it didn&#8217;t really faze me; I was sort of shocked by it. But he kept hitting them over and over again until they became soar and swollen. I could see where they were beginning to turn a bright red and I finally felt the irritating pain. I started to squirm. When I moved he stopped and slapped me across the face. That was more surprising than painful. It took all the power in me not to move as he continued to beat them. It felt like he was trying harder and harder each time to hurt me and as I looked up at him I could see he was enjoying it.
My hands were shaking; I wanted to move so badly. Finally, I jerked again and again he slapped me. I turned my face away from him and tried to think of something else. It only made things worse to watch him. 
�Do you want me to stop?�
�Yes master,� I replied without hesitation.
He stopped for a moment and I looked back at him. He cupped one of my swollen breasts and rubbed it softly. His warm hand sent shock waves through my body. Then he started massaging the other one. 
�Why should I have stopped?�
�Because you were hurting me,� I whined.
�Wrong answer,� he said and I felt the sharp sting of the paddle hit against my unoccupied breast.
With his free hand he continued to massage the same breast, while the other awaited another hit. I flinched as he swung the paddle again, only to stop midway.
�Try again,� he offered.
I didn&#8217;t dare say anything.
�That&#8217;s right. I can hit you all I want and you don&#8217;t have a say in it. Don&#8217;t try to answer a question unless it can be answered with a yes or no,� he said and hit my breast again.
I squeezed my eyes shut and tried to pretend this was all my imagination. The pain he was inflicting upon me was far worse than ever before because I had no way to prevent it. When I opened my eyes I could see him putting the paddle back in the box and sitting down on the side of the bed next to my naked body. 
He pinched both of my nipples and twisted them. I moaned and jerked my head upwards. I didn&#8217;t know where my reaction had come from, the way he twisted them so sharply hurt badly but it also sent sensations through my body. I could feel the warmth in my pelvis rise up. These feelings were all new to me. He ran his fingers along my jaw bone when he saw my reaction and kissed my neck. 
�Are you a virgin?�
�Yes master,� I sighed.
This was far different than any sexual experience I had ever had with a boy. I was only sixteen going on seventeen and although over girls around my age had fooled around before I was a late bloomer. I had a boyfriend about half a year ago that had played with me down there a little but we were all kind of nervous. And this was all so different. This man was twice my age and he knew exactly what he was doing to me.
�Good,� he replied.
He rummaged through his box and pulled out a small chain. It had two clips on it; one on either end. 
�These are going here,� he said
He rubbed each tip until it nipped up and then he clapped on each clip. I could barely keep myself from squirming as they pinched, leaving behind a sort of eerie, on going pain. He pulled up the chain and eventually one of the clips snapped off. I cried out; he slapped me. Then I really started crying, tears and all.
�Quiet down, I&#8217;m just testing them. If they&#8217;re going to spring off like that, obviously they aren&#8217;t tight enough,� he said and clipped the loose one on again.
I could feel the pressure as he twisted little knobs on the sides of the clips to assure their tightness. Then he pulled on the chain again and this time it didn&#8217;t give way when he put that certain amount of pull on it.
�Open your mouth,� he said.
I did as he commanded and he put the center of the chain in my mouth. 
�You let go of that and you&#8217;re going to get punished,� he warned.
I had to hold my head up high to keep the clips from ripping off of my tits. This gave me a perfect view of what he was going to do next and I think that was his plan all along. The back of my neck was starting to strain, and sweat was forming on my forehead as I tried to keep my head up. If I let it fall the chain would not be long enough to stay in my mouth. He circled his finger around my belly button and then ran it between my vaginal lips. At the clinic they had mad sure that I was shaven and clean so that when he played with me we were both very sure of where he was going next. He rolled that sole finger on top of my clit and put some pressure on it. My whole body was growing hot from his temptation.
�Do you masturbate?�
I nodded and he smiled and began to rub a little my quickly. My legs started flinching.
�Not just yet,� he smiled.
Then he reached in his box and pulled out a couple more silver clips, about twice the side of the one on my tits. I knew exactly where they were going as he placed several of them on my folds. And I felt the last one land right on clit. It took everything I had to control myself and keep the screaming and dropping the chain.
�Good girl,� he applauded my prevalence.
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How long will you hold out?� he mocked suddenly and started twisting the clips in their places.
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That pain was worse than the initial and my head jerked several times automatically pulling on the chain and on my nipples. But I wouldn&#8217;t let go of the chain and so my tits suffered every time I moved. But in some sort of sick way I was enjoying it deep down. I could feel it somewhere beneath the surface. On the outside I was just a poor abused girl, but when I saw him playing with me, taking his time to twist each clip and watch my reaction with pleasure it turned me on too. And the way my nipples felt tight pressure after every movement I made only added to the experience.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Somewhere between the sexual torture and my lost train of thought I dropped the chain and he stopped what he was doing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You broke my rule,� he said strictly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m so sorry!� I cried.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And there, you broke another!� he said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t see the point in it! I don&#8217;t know why I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m sorry! How am I supposed to justify myself if all I can say is yes or no,� I yelled and started twisting around on the mattress.
 He unscrewed the clamps and took them off. Then he slapped me across each breast. He pulled out the paddle again and started beating me wherever he pleased. I didn&#8217;t even resist this time, I just jerked and thrashed as I pleased while he beat me. I didn&#8217;t even care, the only place it really hurt was against my tits or on my crotch. When he finally felt he was satisfied, I had already withdrawn to a different place; far from him. He only interrupted me when he started speaking again.
�Are you going to behave? Have you learned your lesson?� he asked petting my swollen skin.
�Fuck you,� I said as I turned my head towards him. 
He slapped me across the face again, and he hit so hard this time it felt like a punch. 
�If that&#8217;s the way you are going to behave you will have to be silenced,� he said and pulled out a gag.
He stuffed the large soft rubber ball in my mouth and tied the straps behind my head. I looked away again in shame and felt a lot more foolish now. 
�I&#8217;m almost done with you for today. We just have one last thing to do,� he said. 
He ran his fingers over my face and around my partially opened mouth.
�It looks fitting on you. This gag never really went so well with my wife, but then again she wouldn&#8217;t let me do the things I&#8217;m going to do to you. You&#8217;re my little toy; you&#8217;re my play thing,� he said and ran his lips across my neck.
By now I just wanted him to be done. The gag made me feel like an animal again; a helpless, weak animal. He gently rubbed my nipples between his finger tips and they were so sensitive it didn&#8217;t take long my body to start betraying my mind. I was sexually aroused again whether I liked it or not. I followed his fingers with my mind as I closed my eyes. They ran back down to my pelvis. He removed the clips, leaving behind a tolerable sting I chose to avoid. His finger tips ran across my clit again, he rolled them gently; then he rubbed his fingers against my wet hole to collect some lube and continued to work on my clit. I could feel my legs start shaking like some sort of horny dog, but I couldn&#8217;t stop what my body was doing.
It didn&#8217;t take long for my first orgasm to built up and collapse over me, he could tell; I knew he could tell although I wasn&#8217;t looking at him. My deep breathing was muffled by the gag and I could feel small strands of sweat start running down the sides of my head and my neck because I didn&#8217;t have the head hair to stop it. I let him un-strap my ankles and set them down freely on the bed. I heard as he unbuckled his pants and nothing more. Then he got on top of me and put my legs on either side of him. He ran the tip of his penis against my folds and pushed it in with one good blow. 
I could feel the tear inside of me. There was so much pressure from that first push, but it didn&#8217;t really hurt like everyone said it would, it felt good, I liked the pressure. Once he was in he grabbed both of my ankles with his hands to move my pelvis anyway he wanted. He pushed deeper and deeper inside as he continued to fuck me. My bottom went off the bed and into mid air as he held me and pushed while he moved on his knees. I was so sore and but the pain was good and I absorbed every hard hit he made. 
Finally, he set me down and put in a few more deep long pumps before he collapsed onto me. I opened my eyes to see he was still fully clothed. He had nothing to say, he just lay there with his penis going limp inside of me. I could feel my body had had another orgasm and my vaginal muscles were involuntarily wrapping themselves around his cock.&nbsp; He only took a minute to collect himself again and then he got up and left.
My hands were still tied, but my legs were free so I rolled over to one side and tried to fall asleep. But my head was rushing with thoughts and my body was itching from all the unwanted moisture soaking my skin. I had never expected my first time to be like that, but it was and in a way it was something special and different rather than cruel and disgusting. I reassured myself that I was going to be alright and I already knew that this type of torture excited me in an unexplained way. I didn&#8217;t have to learn to like it, I was already prone to liking it and it was finally being brought out of me. I would have liked to start out slow if it was up to me but I hadn&#8217;t had the choice. And I didn&#8217;t particularly enjoy the pain; I just liked how it made the pleasure so much better in comparison to it.
I fell asleep without even realizing it. 
I don&#8217;t think it was that much later when I woke up again. I heard the door open and my master walked it. He had a t-shirt on and some jeans. It was almost strange to see him in casual wear, but I think it made him more human.
�I though that you could use some cleaning up,� he said.
That being said, he came over and untied my wrists. I sat up, but he didn&#8217;t take off the gag and I knew better than to take it off myself. He ordered me to put my hands behind my back and pulled a small black remote from his pocket. He pushed a couple number buttons on it and I felt the magnet bracelets activate. They clinched together and I tried to pull them apart out of curiosity and no luck; he had been truthful about their strength. 
He let me use the toilet and then we made it out of the room. We went over to the servant wing and took a turn. It led into a large bathroom. There were about three shower stalls connected to each other in front of us. Three stalled bathrooms on one side and three sinks and a large mirror across their way. Inside there was a young woman with towels in hand. She wore a white cotton dress that came down to her knees, with white stocking that ended just before the dress started to reveal a little skin and white laced up shoes. She bowed lightly as we entered and I noticed as I looked closer that she also had magnetic bracelets on.&nbsp; 
He let go of me and walked over to the sink, he leaned up against it and nodded his head.
�Right this way,� she said and pointed towards the middle shower. 
He moved over just enough to where he would have a good view to watch. She pulled the shower curtain back and I walked inside. 
�I was thinking that since you were my pet you didn&#8217;t really have the right to clean yourself properly. I mean a pet doesn&#8217;t wash themselves, they get washed and groomed by another and even if they don&#8217;t like it, which many of them don&#8217;t, they still have it done. Animals in the wild clean themselves, but you aren&#8217;t in the wild, you&#8217;re in captivity so that will be all left up to me and that&#8217;s how I want it,� he said.
I tried to move out of the way as she turned on the water and tested it for warmth with her hand. Then she soaped up a sponge and started washing me. This was also a very strange experience for me but I sort of enjoyed how delicate she was, the warm of the water and my master watching. She turned off the water for a minute and took the time to shave me everywhere necessary, including my head, which I expect was so stay bald on the masters orders. Then she rinsed me off one more time and let me stand in the shower stall as she got her towels. She dried me off and took me to the sink, where she brushed my teeth and applied lotion to my body. When she was finished she handed me back to my master and we walked back to my training room. 
He sat me down on my bed and reached into his other pocket; he pulled out a plain black leather collar.
�I thought about it and decided that a pet really wouldn&#8217;t be complete without a collar and since you are the only pet in the house you&#8217;ll be the only one wearing one of these. And while we&#8217;re at it, you won&#8217;t be wearing anything else. An animal doesn&#8217;t wear clothes, especially if they are a common household pet. The only time you&#8217;ll ever be wearing anything is if someone at the house wants to play dress up with you,� he said.
He put the collar on and buckled it at the back of my neck. 
�This isn&#8217;t a very nice one, but it&#8217;s perfect for training,� he said and hooked his finger through the metal loop in the front and gave it a pull.
�How does it feel?� he asked.
He knew I couldn&#8217;t talk. Why did he insist on asking me questions?
�Lay down,� he ordered. I did what he wanted.
Soon after, he removed the gag, unclipped my wrists and left the room. 
I touched the collar with the tips of my fingers and felt the fine leather. I would have just taken it off then and there, but I liked how it felt. These feelings I had towards my new experiences made me acceptant to the collar. I felt so alive. It wasn&#8217;t like being stuck in my old life with the same melancholy drifting of time and space in a perfect world. It was messed up, it was a fantasy and I liked it. Most of all, everyone had lied to me; this man was not even close to being as bad of a man as everyone set him out to be. He didn&#8217;t attack me or try to turn me into some sort of monster like the clinic tried to do, he was just amusing himself and I sort of enjoyed it.
My fingers continued to feel all around me. I felt the concrete walls and how ruff and confining they were. I touched my smooth shaven body and finally my clit. I masturbated until I was satisfied and fell asleep again. 
A couple hours later I woke up and there was a tray sitting on the floor. There were two dog dishes on it; one with water and the other with oatmeal. It was degrading, but I ate it all because I was starving. After I was done eating, I just sat there and stared at the walls and ceiling. I wasn&#8217;t tired, and I had lost track of whether it was day or night, or when my master would come visit me next. 
About and hour or two after I had woken up I heard foot steps. Out of eagerness to see him I can up to the door. I heard voices and was disappointed to hear that they were two female voices instead of a man&#8217;s. They came closer and I saw the door handle move as one of them tried to open it. But it was locked.
�Uh, what a monster! He locked it. I though we could get a little sneak peak of this girl,� one voice said.
�I guess he was serious when he said he wanted it to be a surprise. Why do you think it&#8217;s a girl? Maybe he&#8217;s got a boy,� the other argued.
�He wouldn&#8217;t do that. I know he&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t like the same sex as him, that&#8217;s why he never requests Matthew into his bedroom. He said he got a play toy; if he doesn&#8217;t want a man to have sex with, why would he get one for his fantasy play?�
There was a silence.
�Anyway, I hope he doesn&#8217;t keep her in there for long, he&#8217;ll take all the fun out of her, what a hog! She&#8217;ll come out all shriveled like,� the same voice complained.
�Maybe we could talk to her,� the other suggested.
�Hello, girl, can you hear us?�
I was tempted to reply, but I knew that my master would definitely hear about it and I wasn&#8217;t willing to get on his bad side from such a stupid thing. So I sat there quietly, trying not to move so that they would think that I was asleep or something.
�Girl, if you hear me please reply. You don&#8217;t have to be scared,� she said.
I didn&#8217;t say anything and in a minute they walked away. I didn&#8217;t move from my spot, I just sat there and contemplated about how the two women looked like and who they were. One of them was bossier and louder than the other one, and they also talked about a man named Matthew, would I like him? I heard the door click and jumped. My thoughts had captured me and I hadn&#8217;t even noticed that my master was on the outside of that door until he had already entered. He saw me sitting on the floor peacefully and asked me to stand up.
�I heard from two of my girls that you talked to them just a little bit earlier,� he said.
I shook my head; it wasn&#8217;t true.
�They both witnessed this; why would I believe one slave over two of my girls?� he asked.
I bowed my head. I knew he was right; there was no way I could prove myself and he would believe anyone over me. I couldn&#8217;t even speak; what would I say? Yes or no? That wouldn&#8217;t justify me. And he didn&#8217;t give me an option to argue my case. He came up close of and placed one of his hands on my head; he ran his hand gently across it and then cupped my face in his hands. He rubbed gently and I closed my eyes to feel his deep caress.
�I&#8217;m going to have to punish you for being disobedient against me,� he said gently as he continued to pet me.
I nodded in agreement. He let go of my face and directed me towards the chains behind me. He took my hands and shackled them into place. They hung far apart on either side of me. My eyes were facing the concrete wall and my back was towards him. I heard him walk away and he didn&#8217;t return for some time. When he finally did he put a long, thick wooded bar between my legs and attacked cufflinks to my ankles on either side of the wooden bar, spreading them at least three feet. I felt the cold metal sting as he attacked multiple clamps on the lips of my snatch and I felt the weighs dangling off of them. When he was done with that he pursued on to attach two more on my tits. These ones were a little different than the ones he used before. They had little teeth that bit in and weights at the end that dangled and added pressure every time I moved. I winced at the sudden pain and heard him chuckle with pleasure. He gabbled the back of my neck and held it roughly; I tightened up in fear. Then he released the pressure and started to message lightly. I felt one hand massaging while the other reached around and tugged lightly on the weight. My body released endorphins and I was suddenly swarmed with pleasure. He flicked the weigh and it tugged lightly as he continued to caress my neck and back. 
�A little pleasure and a little pain makes a perfect slave,� he said and then stopped. 
 I felt a hard lash of his wipe and my face and knees hit the concrete wall. I was surprised and worried at the same time. My body tightened up again preparing for the next hit and watching out for the wall. He hit me again in a different spot. The beating quickened and he ran his wipe up and down my body. It felt like a cut again my flesh every time. I felt convinced that he was cutting through my skin with the way he was hitting me. It didn&#8217;t take long to break me and I felt my cheek rest against the wall in wiriness. I tried to guess the next time he would hit me and where it would be and I would try to flinch of dodge it but it was no use. The weights were painfully pulling against my skin and I leaned my breasts against the wall to stop them from moving but there was no way to stop the one in crotch from moving since my legs were permanently open. He never made a pattern with the way he hit me so that I&#8217;d keep guessing. I think he liked to see me flinch when I expected him to hit again but he didn&#8217;t. The most awful thing was to know that there wasn&#8217;t a thing I could do. 
 Finally I broke down and started yelling, crying and telling him to stop. That he had to stop because I couldn&#8217;t take anymore and he had to understand that. But that just made him angrier and he beat me harder and more relentlessly for disobeying his orders and not keeping quiet. I felt my knees give in eventually and my back bend while my dangling arms held me up. 
When I thought I couldn&#8217;t take anymore, and I seriously thought I would faint, or should have fainted already, he stopped. I used the last energy I had to stand myself up fully again. I was in some other place now, away from the pain. I couldn&#8217;t bare not being in any control and feeling so much pain. I kept my crying face pressed against the wall. He set down his wipe and ran his hands down my wounded back, then in between my legs. He unclipped the clamps and dropped them to the floor. I felt a finger go in, then two. He moved them in and out slowly and pressed his warm, clothed body against my cold naked one. I felt so safe, although I was being protected by the same man who had caused me so much harm.
I didn&#8217;t want to feel the warm sensations, but my body thought otherwise. It was battered and beaten, but ready for sex. He pulled out his fingers and untied me. Then he ordered me to lye down on my stomach, as to not irritate the wounds on my back. After that he tied my hands behind my back, then my feet together and attached them all behind me, hogtying me. I heard him walk away and I let my face rest against the old mattress. He returned and I suddenly felt pressure push into my vagina; I though it was his penis, but that couldn&#8217;t be possible because he was standing next to my bed. He pressed it as deep as possible and then I felt it start vibrating. He added additional pressure as he placed something, semi thick and long into my butt hole. After that he wrapped duct tape in between my legs and around my lower pelvis area to secure the items there in place. Once he was satisfied with his creation and sure that the items were safely locked in place he patted my butt once or twice. Stood and adored his creation, then put a blindfold over my eyes and left.
I tried to relax and ignore what first felt like an irritation. I was tired and wanted to rest but the constant vibrations running through my body and centering in my snatch wouldn&#8217;t let me. I tried to rearrange my thoughts and melt away but with the blindfold on I couldn&#8217;t concentrate on anything except for the movement. When I finally relaxed the purpose of this game really started to kick in. My pelvis sunk down and applied more pressure to the vibrations and I felt warm, tingling sensations cover my body head to toe. I started enjoying the feelings and ran by pelvis again the mattress trying to create more pressure. My body began to move with my feelings and soon enough I had an orgasm.&nbsp; Soon following I had another. And then another and although I should have been enjoying this ecstasy, I was starting to worry. My head was aching and I was tired of the constant nudging the vibrator was causing my body to react to involuntarily. I just stopped expecting a build up for another orgasm and lay very still hoping that my body would get used to the movement as just a motion and not something to constantly react to. But I was wrong, although it wasn&#8217;t pleasant and took a very long time, another orgasm rolled out and my body was begging for mercy. I thought that I would just give up and go to sleep but my mind and my body, like always were on a different page. 
After who knows how long, I felt the vibrator slow down it&#8217;s pace and finally it died. The battery just gave out and I was free. In exhaustion I collapsed and fell asleep without another minute to spare.


Chapter 3



I don&#8217;t know how much time passed until someone entered my room. I looked up to see that it was the same girl that had washed me earlier. She first looked shocked and a little disgusted to see me in the position I was in as she entered the room.
�The master of the house wanted to have you cleaned up and to attend dinner for a formal introduction,� she said as she walked up to me.
I watched her closely as she examined the room; she was looking for cameras. I knew it was a camera free zone and that she had the right to say anything she wanted. She knelt down and closed in on me until we were only inches away from each others faces. She touched my cheek and then ran her fingers gently over me scalp.
�Why are you touching me?� I asked softly.
I didn&#8217;t want to scare her away, I was just curious about her intent. It didn&#8217;t make me nervous that she was examining me so closely; on the contrary, I liked it.
�I&#8217;m wondering about how this became your fate. Why are you here and why does he do these things to you,� she answered.
I didn&#8217;t answer.
�Do you miss your hair; actually, that&#8217;s a silly question; none of those things matter here. I guess my question is; do you miss your freedom?� she asked.
�I don&#8217;t know,� I answered honestly.
�Do you mean to say that you enjoy this?� she asked, astonished.
�No I don&#8217;t.�
�Then what do you mean?�
�I don&#8217;t know. One minute I hate it because he hurts me and the next I am aroused at his power over me. I don&#8217;t know what it is or what he is doing to me,� I said.
�I&#8217;m envious,� she admitted.
�You don&#8217;t want this,� I said.
�I&#8217;m at exactly the same place you are; I am his prisoner, his slave, but he will never touch me or devote any careful attention towards me,� she said.
�Do you like this?� I asked.
She looked surprised. Then she looked at my sweaty, tired, tied up body and took in a deep breath. 
�I think you look beautiful. I thought you were beautiful the minute you were brought into that bathroom and I got to run warm water over your tattered body. I love the stains on your body,� she said and leaned in until she was less than an inch from my face.
I could feel her warm breath run across my lips. She touched them with her fingers tips.
�I find this all very fascinating, I&#8217;m not going to lie. I would do anything to be in your place, yet again I find it even more pleasing to see you in this position,� she said and slowly kissed me.
I didn&#8217;t refuse her. I let it happen. I don&#8217;t know why I did; I wasn&#8217;t attracted to women, but she was older than me and beautiful herself. In this new, strange world I was living in these things didn&#8217;t really seem to matter. Her kisses were slow and gentle. I liked the way she ran her hand across and cheek and to the nape of neck as she explored my mouth with her tongue. All that mattered now was if it felt good or bad, and whatever she was doing to me felt good, so I let her, until she was done and then she untied me and pulled out the play toys.
She got me up and took me to the bathroom, cleaned me up and got me ready for dinner.
�Here are some house rules. You&#8217;re probably familiar with them all by now, but if you aren&#8217;t, here they are; don&#8217;t speak unless spoken to directly and the answer should be yes or no unless privileged to speak otherwise. No eye contact with anyone unless commanded to do so, keep your eyes on the floor. Always take commands no matter how silly they may be, if you don&#8217;t you are sure to be punished for it; they are probably testing you. Honestly, and this is my own opinion on things, don&#8217;t do anything unless commanded to. Don&#8217;t eat, drink, sleep or anything else authorized. You&#8217;re on trial right now, if you don&#8217;t behave you&#8217;ll end up in that same old concrete room, if you do, things might look up for you. So be a good girl,� she said.
She opened a bottom drawn and pulled out nipple clamps; she applied them carefully, screwed them tightly to make sure they were safe and let the chain dangle between my breasts. She left the rest of the toys on the sink counter and pulled out one last thing from the bottom drawer. It was a leash, a couple feet long and she attached it to the loop at the front of my collar. We both looked at the mirror in front of us. I was bald, naked and collared, with a leash and metal hanging from my tits. She was dressed up neatly and holding the leash. I thought we looked very strange.
�This is all very silly isn&#8217;t it?� I asked.
�You&#8217;re beautiful. Throughout all of this, remember that. No matter how humiliating the situation, you are here because he chose you and he wouldn&#8217;t chose someone below his high set standards,� she said.
I nodded and we made our way out of the bathroom. It wasn&#8217;t difficult to keep my eyes to the ground. In fact, I found it more relieving to do so because it prevented more embarrassment for me while we walked to the halls and everyone stared at me. I heard some people snicker and I saw from the corner of my eye some people just watching in awe. I didn&#8217;t really notice where we were going, I just watched the floor change from concrete to wood, to tile, to marble and then we were there in the dinning hall. 
�Your pet, Master Alfred,� she announced once we stopped.
�There she is,� I heard some one whisper.
�Bring her over here,� he ordered.
I followed her as she led me over to the table. There was a red cushion on the floor several feet away from the table. It was closest to the seat of my master, but distant enough to show that I was not part of the dinner party. I didn&#8217;t look up, but from what I could see the dinning hall was very large, the table stretched out a bit and from the glace I got it was well decorated and the chains and table were beautifully crafted.&nbsp; She tied to end of the leash to a leg of the table closest to me and I stood there waiting for someone to say something. The servant had already left the room.
�Sit down girl,� he ordered and I placed my self on the cushion. I sat down and continued to gaze to the ground.
�This is the thing that you&#8217;ve all been anxious to see. I don&#8217;t know what the fuss has been about. She&#8217;s just some gangly girl. I think that all of you have a problem with me keeping things to myself. I doubt that you&#8217;ll give me a moment alone with her from now on. You could hardly give me three days to set her straight. Do you really think that&#8217;s enough time?� He said to his company.
�Oh Alfred, stop all of your complaining. You know we have nothing better to do around here than to chat and whine about the things we cannot have. This one thing was the only thing that you were refusing us, it wasn&#8217;t fair,� I heard an older woman&#8217;s voice say.
�I spoil all of you too much. She&#8217;s mine and should have stayed that way if you all weren&#8217;t such hungry dogs,� he barked, but he wasn&#8217;t being serious.
It fascinated me how gently and light heartedly he spoke with everyone at the table. As if there wasn&#8217;t a worry in the world and none of them could do him wrong. He never spoke that way with me. He always seemed so heavy at heart, like things were weighing him down, and if he wasn&#8217;t carrying the weight of the world, he was tricking me with his sensitive, fake calming affect. But here at the table he was very real, personal and charming. I wished that was how he referred to me, but I wasn&#8217;t on the same page as his company.
�She looks well behaved,� I heard as I joined into the conversation again.
�That&#8217;s just because she&#8217;s scared. I know how these things work; you have them listen at first, but then you let them have their way just once and they walk all over you. So I hope that all of you take your part in being responsible for keeping her in place,� he ordered.
There was a long silence.
�Should we talk about something else?� said a women&#8217;s voice and they continued on to another subject.
Two servants came into the room and set up the first course for everyone. My knees were starting to get sore and I was tires; waiting for my turn to eat. A servant came over and placed a bowl of soup on the floor in front of me, and then he lay down a piece of warm white bread next to it. He didn&#8217;t leave any utensils or napkins for me. I could smell the delicious odor of the creamy soup crawling up my nostrils, but I didn&#8217;t dare touch it. I knew that following the instructions of the girl would be wise. 
In a moment or two I felt a shadow come over me, but I didn&#8217;t look up. I knew that it was a woman; I could hear the clicking of her heels. All of the bustling dinner conversation was in the background as I narrowed my hearing onto her graceful steps. She knelt over me and picked up my chin. I looked up into her eyes for the first time that night and felt captivated all of a sudden. She was very beautiful and elegant. Her eyes were dark and deep, but her smile seemed playful. It was definitely a bad combination. She intimidated me, and I hated the feeling in my stomach and how fast my heart was beating. I was beginning to be thankful that I couldn&#8217;t talk; because if I couldn&#8217;t I probably wouldn&#8217;t be able to anyway. 
I was in so much shock that she was devoting her attention to me that I missed out on what she was saying. I was her lips moving, and my eyes began to dart towards the table; I saw the master at the head of the table, a younger woman sitting on his left, staring in my direction, a man on his right with his back facing me and an older woman on the opposite end of the table. By now all of attention was drawn towards me and I was definitely scared.
�Eyes over here girl!� she barked and shook me by my chin.
I threw my eyes in her direction again. She was much older now that I could clearly see her. She was at least thirty, but not older that thirty five. Her hair was pulled back and combed glamorously and she wore a silky red dress that wrapped around her curvy body. She was tall, I could tell, even though she wasn&#8217;t standing up and she had a powerful, conceited way about her. She wasn&#8217;t fat, but she was skinny enough to be considered weak. I recognized her voice immediately; she was the louder lady behind my door the night those two women came to visit me. 
�What do you call her?� she asked Alfred.
�I haven&#8217;t thought of a name for her yet. Do you have a suggestion?� he said.
She examined me, turned my face this way and that. 
�I don&#8217;t think she really even needs a name. I think a name would give her too much authority, and I want her to be exactly the way she is now. Why don&#8217;t we just call her what she is. A girl or a pet or something,� she suggested.
�That sounds fine. Call her Pet, it&#8217;s not like we would be referring to another pet; we don&#8217;t have any,� he said and I glanced over to see that they were all nodding in agreement.
�You are terrible at following commands, Pet,� she said as I looked back at her.
�I ask you one thing, which is to look at me, and only me, and what do you do? Not once, but twice do you manage to disobey and disrespect me by going about the room with those scared little eyes of yours,� she said.
I kept my eyes focus on her eyebrows, trying to keep away from her wicked, digging eyes. She let go of my chin finally and grabbed the bread off the floor. She broke off a piece and dipped it in the soup. I never looked down to see what see was doing. From my peripherals I saw the bread moving towards my lips. My view slipped and there I was again trapped in her eyes. I knew she was talking but I was lost again, I felt the broken piece of bread being pushed past my half opened mouth and my tongue welcomed it. 
�I said; are you hungry?� she glared.
I came back to reality and started to chew. The warm juice seeped out of the bread and down my throat. I hadn&#8217;t realized how hungry I was until then. I nodded.
�Well, that&#8217;s really too bad because you&#8217;re missing dinner; bad pets like yourself will miss dinner if they disobey, so here&#8217;s your first lesson,� she said.
Since I had already lost her game, I let go of her eyes and moved them about to watch her as she picked up my bowl of soup and poured it onto my bare, naked chest. I jerked in surprise, but the soup had been sitting out long enough to turn lukewarm. 
�Face to the ground, slave!� she ordered and felt her hand grab the back of my head and ram it again the cold floor.
�Stay there until other wise ordered to do,� she said and stood up.
&nbsp; I readjusted myself just enough to have my cheek pressed against the floor without turning the rest of my body sore. My knees were tucked lightly under my chest with the sticky soup smeared over them. I let my arms lay lightly against the sides of my body and had my eyes watch the walls instead of facing the unpleasant dinner party.
There was no point in trying to hear what they were talking about. I felt so humiliated, and although I knew that my fate would be something like this, it only felt terrible when it actually happened. I felt so degraded; even dogs weren&#8217;t treated like this, even dogs had names. I had nothing, and I couldn&#8217;t see how I would live like this forever. I could only imagine being called a slave or a pet and being pushed around and fucked by a group of ruthless, selfish people. I began to cry. These were quiet tears, not loud enough for anyone at the table to hear, and I was glad not to bring any attention on myself. That would be the last thing I wouldn&#8217;t want to do. 
The servers brought in dinner and I smelt the most delicious aromas from their meal. But I also heard the woman from before order the servers not to give me my serving and I felt my heart fall even lower to the floor. My stomach growled madly. I couldn&#8217;t remember the last time I had been able to eat as much as I wanted and to enjoy it even more. 
Finally I heard the last of the dinner conversations and the last of clanking utensils again her plates. They all agreed to meet up again later on in the evening for tea and desert. I heard them all stand up and make their way out of the room. 
�Jazz, you made the mess, you clean it up,� I heard the master say.
She laughed and ordered some servants, who had come in to assisted them out and clean up, to clean me up along with the dishes, get me ready for tea and bring me over to the library. 
From what I had collected over dinner, the bossy lady that had made an encounter with me was named Jasmine, her friend that had come with her to visit me was names Abigail. The name of the man; who spoke very little and had his back facing me, was Matthew, the master&#8217;s name was Alfred and his wife, who was the woman across the table with him, was Amber.
A man helped stand me up and wipe some of they soup off of me with a wash cloth. He untied the leash from the table and led me down the hall. Then he took me back the shower stalls and rinsed me off.
�I think it&#8217;s sick what their doing to you. I&#8217;m sorry for how badly things have turned out for you. If it makes you fell any better, everyone from the servant quarters pity&#8217;s you,� he finally said as he was drying me off.
He had removed the nipple clamps and left them on the counter. I smiled at him.
�Don&#8217;t be afraid to talk to me. We all see you as one of us. We are misfortunate people who were captured and taken here against our will. We don&#8217;t have the choice to leave; many of us have been here for years. I&#8217;ve been serving for at least three, although I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s more than that, I&#8217;ve stopped counting after three. No one will disrespect you except for the master of the house and his company,� he said.
�Thank you,� I said.
He was middle aged, with dark curly hair and Native American skin and eyes. He seemed wise and very kind, I liked him instantly. 
�Megan, the girl who took care of you earlier really respects you. She has told us about how kind you are. Everyone here will treat you with the same kindness,� he offered.
I stood quietly as he applied fragrant lotion onto my skin and put the nipple clamps on after he rinsed them clean.
�I&#8217;m sorry once again,� he said as I flinched, my nipples were very sore.
After we were finished he led me to the servant&#8217;s kitchen and gave me a sandwich. I ate it greedily as he explained to me, that he wasn&#8217;t going to let me go hungry. Then he led me down the hall and once again I watched the floor change below me and I was led into a large room with wooden floors. He left me standing until a red cushion was brought in. It was placed in the farthest corner of the room between to tall book shelves lined up against both walls. Then there was silence and I was alone. I let my eyes wander about the room. The ceiling was high and two crystal chandeliers hanging from it. There were two long book shelves that ran from across the two walls closest to me and up to the ceiling. The books looked old but they were dusted and taken care off. The other two walls had large framed portraits, waiting chairs, small stands with plants and statues and the wooden double door that led in. In the center there was a warm brown couch and three other large, soft lounging chairs revolved around a coffee table. There were also a few side tables near the chairs that held vases or were simply empty and ready to hold anything placed on them. 
I didn&#8217;t have a leash on anymore so I felt more at ease to relax and curl up on the cushion. It didn&#8217;t take long for me to fall asleep, but I awoke when I heard some servants come in and I watched as they set up tea on the coffee table and left a cart of desert against the wall that held up the doors. A few minutes after that, the house company began to enter into the room. First came Jasmine and I dreaded the though of her harassing me, but I knew she would and kept my eyes to the ground as she came over to me. 
I saw her beautiful long legs peek out of her nearly see-through, white robe. She was wearing delicate white heels with small stones on the outer corners. 
�Look at me, slave,� she ordered.
I shot my eyes up to her glowing face as quickly as possible, hoping to not irritate her in anyway. She smiled as she watched my frightened expressions. My muscles were all tightened up, but I didn&#8217;t dare move from my curled up position. 
�You&#8217;re so cute when you&#8217;re nervous,� she teased and got on her knees to be closer to me.
I felt her cold fingers run down my neck as I kept my eyes glued of her. She had curious lust in her eyes and it scared me. I was more than glad to hear the doors open as someone else entered. She stood back up quickly and walked over to meet her friend. I let my eyes rest and watched the dust run across the wooden floor. 
�Hello beautiful,� she said to her companion.
�Hello to you too,� the other said, it was Abigail.
�How many times have we been here and how many more nights will these meetings continue?� she said in a bored voice.
�Until the day we lose a fight and die,� the other said calmly, but it made me nervous.
I knew they were both creatures now, warriors that were brought here to fight and die for their master. But it seemed like they had survived many fights and had been in the resident for some time now. The door opened and Alfred walked in, I recognized his voice as he greeted them and they all sat down. His wife and Matthew entered last and they were greeted warmly. I heard the china clanking while everyone had their tea and talked about many different things that had no meaning and were merely small talk to pass the time. I dared not to look up and watch them though, just incase one of them were surveying me and would be glad to take action in punishing me. 
Jasmine&#8217;s voice was smooth as she excused herself and walked over to pick a book from a shelf. I knew she was watching me, I could feel her dark eyes burning against my skin.
�I want to play with the slave tonight? Is that alright?� she asked to anyone who was listening.
�I was going to have her tonight, but it shouldn&#8217;t be too long until I am finished her and you can have her after me,� he said lightly.
�What if I fall asleep before you&#8217;re done? How long will you be with her? I want to play with her too,� she whined.
�I am the master of this house, so if I want her I will have her. If you fall asleep before I&#8217;m finished you can play with her the following day or night. She&#8217;s not going anywhere,� he said, annoyed.
�Sorry,� she said and I could feel her resentful defeat.
�What about the rest of us?� asked Matthew.
There was a period of silence again.
�Oh she doesn&#8217;t really matter to anyone except for Alfred and Jasmine anyway,� he argued with himself and stopped talked.
There was a gentle laugh.
�That&#8217;s right Matthew, not everyone needs a play thing. Not everyone wants a thing like that,� the wife spoke.
I knew she liked Matthew, I could hear it in her voice, the way she sympathized with him. There was a silence and I felt that they had exchanged glances.
�Abigail wants to play with her. She&#8217;s just too much of a coward to say anything,� Jasmine argued loudly. 
She always talked the loudest though, even if she wasn&#8217;t trying to argue.
�Well?� she urged Abigail to speak.
�I think she&#8217;s fascinating, I wouldn&#8217;t mind,� Abigail finally spoke.
Alfred grunted in his acknowledgement toward her. Jasmine finally picked out a book and sat back down. I closed my eyes and pretended to fall asleep.
�This must have been the silliest idea you&#8217;ve had yet,� his wife finally said.
�You&#8217;ll get used to her.�
�And what happens when you&#8217;re bored of her?� she asked.
�I&#8217;ll let Jasmine have her,� he said.
�And what happens when she&#8217;s bored with her?�
�I&#8217;ll take care of her; I&#8217;ll make sure she&#8217;s fed,� Jasmine argued.
�And then what?� the wife continued.
�Oh let it go. We&#8217;ll always have a use for her,� her husband grunted.
�Well, you&#8217;d better go have your fun with her before it gets too late in the night. I know how irritated you become with you don&#8217;t get enough sleep. I don&#8217;t want you going about the house barking at everyone. Go on now,� she said and I heard him get up.
I opened my eyes and waited for him to approach me.
I felt him lean over and clip a leash onto my collar. 
�Get up Pet,� he ordered.
I stood up as he yanked on the leash and followed his close lead and he pulled me out of the room. He only walked a few feet ahead of me but I kept my eyes to the ground and let the leash lead me. We took a stair case up and then another onto a third floor. Finally we were at his door and I stopped in my tracks. I realized what he was about to do to me and I was afraid again. My knees went weak and I became dizzy and over whelmed. He tugged on the leash but I wouldn&#8217;t move. He came up to me and grabbed me by the back of my neck and pushed me through the door.
Nothing was keeping me from trying to break away in fear, so I let my natural instincts kick in and tried to pull away from his grip. I looked up and tried to push him away with my free hands. But he held the back of my neck with one hand and the gripped the start of the least closely with the other. I squirmed and whined and tried to hit and kick him. He threw me on the floor with intention to make it hurt and I took the opportunity of freedom to try to get up and run for the door. But I was barely on my hands and knees as he stepped on my back with his foot and collapsed me to the ground again. He kept me firms down as he pulled his belt off and wrapped my wrists together. It wasn&#8217;t a normal pant belt though; it was a silky one for a bathrobe. Once my arms were secure behind my back he took his foot off of me. I squired in place and tried to get myself up without the use of my arms. 
He grabbed me by the back of my collar and tied arms and pulled me up until I was standing. 
�You&#8217;re a stupid girl,� he hissed.
�Fuck you,� I spat.
�It&#8217;s fine with me though, I like the fight in you,� he laughed.
I tried to break away again. He held me tighter and led me over to the large bed at the center of the back wall. It was dark in the room. All that kept things in view was the moonlight from the large window on the side wall. The bed had four tall, heavy bars leading up to the frame that held a canopy over the bed. He led me to one of the back end bars and told me to get on my knees. I hesitatingly followed his order. He tied the leash around the bar and as close to my collar as he could get so I didn&#8217;t have room to move my head around. He then tied my feet together, so that I was on my knees facing the bed with no ability to use my hands or feet. 
I heard him rustle around somewhere at the end of his room and he than came over and paced around to admire his work.
�I am going to punish you, slave, do you know why I&#8217;m punishing you?� he asked slowly in a low tone.
�Speak up,� he ordered.
�Because I tried to run away,� I said quietly and started to cry.
I cried loudly. Not because of any pain he had yet inflicted on me, but because of everything that had happened so far and because I was afraid of him. It was type of cry you could hear down the hall; the type where everything swells up and every cavity on your face starts oozing one thing or another.
�Cry, cry all you want, but that won&#8217;t excuse you from what you did. You have so much more to learn, and obviously you haven&#8217;t had enough punishment yet, with the way you&#8217;ve been acting,� he said.
 I heard a jingle, a clank and then whack!
He hit me hard against my back. I cried even harder, letting the physical pain and the self pity burst of from inside of me. This time was different, I didn&#8217;t try to control my agony, and&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t wait to yell and cuss until I couldn&#8217;t stand anymore, I continued to scream as he beat me. I was like a real animal, shaking and squirming and thrashing my head around. Yelling at him to stop and saying every profanity there was. I felt my transformation coming on. I felt my teeth growing in and nailing thickening, but I also felt his relentless beating. And I knew that he was hurting me even more than before and now with a different, a harder object that would keep my animal from revolting. I thought about turning completely and tearing away from him. Running out of the house and trying to escape. But I also knew that I wouldn&#8217;t get further than the courtyard with the bracelets on my wrists and ankles. I knew that I wouldn&#8217;t get further than that and when they brought me back, he would have to train me and mold me and scare the living shit out of me until I obeyed him, animal or not. So I controlled myself and turned back into a helpless little girl.
When I was an animal I couldn&#8217;t feel his hard hits against my back, but when I turned back into a human, I felt a hard hit on my back and collapsed; letting the collar hold me up the neck while the rest of my body slipped down to the floor. He stopped and took the leash off my collar. I let my face hit the floor and I felt him drag me away from the bed a little. My stomach felt cool against the stone floor. He untied my ankles and pushed my butt up into the air. I kept the side of my face on the floor in fatigue and too tired to try to pull away from his grasp. He grabbed my legs and spread them wide. Then he rammed his hard dick into my wet folds. He pumped vigorously and smacked my ass occasionally. After a minute, he reached over me and tore the chain off of m breasts and threw it to the floor. I cried loudly and the reaction made him pump harder. He grabbed my neck and pulled me off the ground as he continued to pull in and out. He slowed down for a minute and let the push last. I let out a sigh of pleasure, although I didn&#8217;t mean it; purely animalistic.
This encouraged him and he set my head on the ground again. Then he pulled out and pushed back in, except this time it was into a different cavity. I was so surprised I didn&#8217;t have time to tighten up so his dick just slipped into my ass. A warm pressure boiled up deep inside of me and my skin started to sweat. I curled my fingers and toes as he had his way with me up my ass. When I finally started to ache I cried for him to stop and he pulled out and went back to my vagina. The pleasure was amplified and I body started to throb. He turned me over and started fucking me while I watched. He warped my legs around his waist and pushed in and out more gently now, trying to make it last. My orgasm was starting to build up. He bit one of my nipples and caressed them with his tongue as he continued. Finally we were coming to an end and he placed his face against my neck and he hurried his pumping and finally came inside of me.
I felt his heavy body sink onto mine as he came and then he got up when he was done. I lay on the floor helplessly. He left the room and I tried to get up but I was too weak to move from all the beating and fucking, so I just lay there and watched the ceiling. He came back in a couple minutes, but I closed my eyes and tried to forget he was there. He sat down next to my enabled body. He watched me for a minute as my eyes glanced about the room, trying to avoid him and then he rolled me over to my stomach. He tied my feet together and then tied them to my wrists. After that, he rolled me back over again and I was position with my arms and feet behind my back, while my womanhood lay exposed, because my legs had been spread and bend at the knees. He pulled out a vibrator from his robe pocket and turned it on, and then he slipped it into my wet folds. It sat there calmly as it jerked slowly once about every second. Then he pulled out something even smaller, about half the size of his finger and turned it on. It made a low humming noise. He spread my wet lips with his free hand and placed the tiny vibrator against my clit. He moved it gently back and forth, rolled it in small circles and let it sit some more. With one hand occupied he used his over to fondle my breasts. I closed my eyes in pleasure, but he ordered me to keep them open and watch him as he played with me.
I ran my eyes over his body in the moonlight. His healthy, dark skin and black, silky robe aroused me. His face was stern as he watched my twitching, pleasured body give way to oncoming orgasm. The only time I closed my eyes was when I hit climax and couldn&#8217;t control myself. Then I came back to look at him as he continued for a second one. I reached it soon enough and then a third one. After the third, he was satisfied and left me lying on the floor in all tied up as he walked out. 
After some time, two male servants came in and helped to untie me. Then they stood me up, and since I was very weak, too weak to walk, they helped me out of the room. We went down the stairs to the second floor, made a turn and appeared at another door. At that moment I remember that Jasmine was waiting to play with me too. A grown of agony fell from my lips as we entered. 
It was dark; I could tell she was sleeping in her bed at the far end of the room. It was a luxurious room with tables and waiting chairs, cabinets and large windows. 
�Miss; your pet, if it&#8217;s not too late,� one of the servants said.
�Urgh, it is too late. I&#8217;m sleeping can&#8217;t you tell! Just tie her up to something and I&#8217;ll deal with her in the morning,� she mumbled and then it was silent.
They led me over to a pile of tossed pillows on the floor next to the bed and lay me down. Then they tied my hands behind my back and my feet together. They tied the end of my leash to one of the legs of the bed and left. I lay there for some time thinking about everything that happened to me so far. And I wondered about how long this would all last and what would happen to me in the future.
I watched Jasmine sleep, sometimes she would face me and I would watch her as she breathed in and out and sometimes her back was towards me so I traced the line of it with my eyes over and over again. Finally, I fell asleep only to be woken up at sunrise. 
She was an early riser and I had barely had any sleep. I felt so beaten up and aching when I heard her loud voice wake me up. She was already dressed in casual attire and cleaned up. I, on the other hand, was still the same beat up, raped girl that I was the nigh before. She kicked me lightly with her foot and I looked up at her to see what she wanted from me.
�Good morning pet,� she said and smiled, it was one of her devious smiles.
I wanted to get away from her but there was nowhere to go for me. I automatically started crying in thought of what the day would bring. 
�Are you scared of me?� she said in a laughing manner.
I nodded my head.
�Well I don&#8217;t know why you are. I&#8217;m not that inhuman. I won&#8217;t just go around attacking you, goodness. I&#8217;m just making sure that you&#8217;re going to be properly trained for a good pet. If you don&#8217;t disobey me I have no reason to punish you,� she said.
�Are you hungry?� she asked.
I nodded again.
�Alright, then you&#8217;re attending breakfast with me,� she said and started untying me.
When she was finished I stood up, although I was tired and fatigued.
She let me use the bathroom and wash my face. After that she led me out of her room by my leash and down to the dinning hall. Everyone was already seated. I didn&#8217;t look at them, but I recognized their voices. She sat me down where I had been the evening before and food was brought to me in small dog dishes. I ate without even acknowledging what I was feasting on and was completely satisfied. 
They all parted after breakfast and I followed Jasmine. Abigail and she went outside to the park and I shuffled behind them. Although I had expected something worse, the weather outside was pleasant and they sat down on some patio chairs to talk and read. I was position to sit and the foot of Jasmine. 
�I want you to give me a foot massage, slave,� she said and threw off her slippers.
I started working on her feet as soon I possibly could, not wanting to upset her. She talked to her friend and glanced through a magazine at the same time. 
�Did Alfred tell you about the oncoming fight?� Jasmine asked casually.
�Yes, he spoke to me,� Abigail said.
�What are you going to wear?� she asked.
�Oh, I don&#8217;t know yet, something black and slinky like usual,� she said and yawned.
�Are you going downstairs to practice?� 
�No.�
�You should.�
�To be completely honest, I don&#8217;t think it takes much skill to do what we do,� she said calmly.
�I train all of the time and I think that it improves my skills in the fight,� Jasmine admitted.
�Yes, you are so convinced. But I barely ever train and look we are both here,� she said.
�What about the slave; she&#8217;s one of us too. Do you want to see how she turns?� Jasmine asked, kicking her foot a little to alert me.
�I don&#8217;t care for it much,� Abigail said and looked at me for a second.
�You&#8217;re right, she&#8217;ll never fight anyway. What would be the point? I doubt she&#8217;s even been properly trained to control herself. She might even be dangerous if we have her turn,� she contemplated.
�What are you&#8217;re plans for tonight?� she asked.
�Oh I don&#8217;t know.�
�Would you want me to come over to your room?�
�This thing will be there, if that doesn&#8217;t bother you,� she said and kicked at me again.
�I don&#8217;t mind. It might be sort of fun. We could try some things with the three of us,� she said shyly.
�Yes that sound very nice,� she said.
�Alfred wants to host a movie night tonight,� she said.
�I&#8217;ll be there. Are you going to wear a dress?� 
�Yea, I&#8217;ll just wear the same thing I&#8217;ll be wearing for dinner; so formal wear,� she said.
�Me too, I hope you&#8217;re not thinking about the hideous green dress though. I don&#8217;t think I ever told you about how much I hate it,� Jasmine said.
�No.� 
Then Jasmine put her shoes on and I followed her as she left Abigail in the park. We went inside and down the hall, past a couple doors and down more stairs into the basement. It looked like a small gym, with brick walls and equipment everywhere. I noticed Matthew working out, but he didn&#8217;t notice me. I wasn&#8217;t bother by his inferior attention to me, I wasn&#8217;t attracted to him and I really wouldn&#8217;t want anymore attention, because all of the attention I seemed to be getting was unnecessary. She told me to sit down and went over to Matthew; they greeted each other warmly with a hug.
�Do you want to fight?� she asked lightly.
�Yea sure,� he said and paused.
�Abigail is going to be fighting this weekend,� he continued finally.
�I just spoke with her. She doesn&#8217;t seem worried at all,� Jasmine mentioned.
�Well, let&#8217;s do this thing,� he said.
I lifted up my eyes to watch the fight. I was more than fascinated as they both started pulling off their clothes. Jasmine had a beautiful womanly built and Matthew had a body of perfection, with every muscle toned and glowing. Once they were both naked they stood for a moment and stared at each other. Slowly they started to turn into creatures, it was a well managed process and they were both completely in control of themselves. I watched as their bodies transformed and finally stood facing each other.
In a moment, they were grabbing and pulling and tearing at each others skin. It looked painful, but I trusted that they had done this before and they weren&#8217;t actually hurting each other. They began to wrestle with full body contact when they were finally past the awkward clawing stage. Jasmine hit the floor first with her bag as Matthew came crashing onto her. They rolled around trying to pin each other down and finally Matthew managed to hold her down long enough to win the fight. But he wasn&#8217;t done. She was helpless and under his rein, so he took this opportunity as an advantage; he turned her over, against her will, and started to fuck her from behind. I didn&#8217;t even know that was a possibility for someone while they were turned, but there they were and I was their audience. 
It was obviously a struggle for her as she clawed the floor in self defense; trying to get away, but he hand her in a headlock and he only released when he had finished pumping her full if his cum. She lay in defeat, collapsed on the floor, while he stood up, transformed back into a person, grabbed his things and went on his way. 
�Would you like to try that sometime?� he teased as he walked past me.
He could obviously tell I was in shock from what I had just seen. I shook my head in defiance and he left the room.
Jasmine turned back into a person as she lye on the floor and finally stood up to collect herself. For once I had seen a weaker side of her, but as she walked towards me her composure didn&#8217;t seem to change. In fact, she had a way about her that seemed even more confident and womanly than before, as if this man had complimented her instead of disgraced. I lowered my eyes as she approached me.
�Look at me,� she commanded.
I looked up at her glistened body.
�Be honest, and I don&#8217;t want you to keep this answer to a yes or no, I want you to speak your mind. What did you think of all of that?� she asked while putting her clothes back on.
I sat without saying anything for a while. It was more difficult to think of the right words. When the only answer I could give before was a yes or no, the chances of me being right or wrong were even and expected. But now I was allowed to say anything and the chances of offending her were much greater. So I chose to be honest with her.
�I thought it was fascinating. I see you as a beautiful woman,� I said.
�Are you attracted to women?� her curiosity was sparked immediately.
 The question was not easily answered; I didn&#8217;t have a specific taste for gender. I just saw what was good and beautiful and I absorbed it. I saw her as a beautiful, although she was not good to me.
�I&#8217;m attracted to you,� I said stiffly.
She laughed lightly at this, but it seemed to please her.
�I like you after all, I think I will keep you as my pet even when Alfred is tired of you,� she said.
�Will he get tired of me?�
�He has a wife. You aren&#8217;t his primary object,� she said.
There was a pause.
�You shouldn&#8217;t worry about him. Why do you care anyway? He&#8217;s a cruel man; I can only imagine the things he does to you,� she said.
I thought about the words I had spoken, why I worried about him tiring of me. I would be glad if he gave me less attention, he had abused me. But there was something inside of me that was growing and becoming more reliant and needy towards the roughness that he showed.
Jasmine walked past me and I was quick to follow. She went back to her room and tied me to her bed stand again; then she was gone. The time I spent in that room was wasted, I wasn&#8217;t in reach of anything that could pass the time or give it meaning. I was tied too close to the bed to find a book or rummage around for anything. I played with my sore tits, I masturbated, and then I slept. When I woke up, it was already evening, the large windows overlooking the courtyard were painted black. I yawned and my body felt stiff and still dreaming. 
I ate a sandwich and the cold soup that had been brought in a tray which sat near me. My thoughts finally started to clear as I observed my surroundings. Jasmine had never tied my hands of feet, she had merely tied my leash to the bed and I had spent hours feeling miserable and trapped. My common sense had left the building and I had been put under some sort of submissive spell. I laughed about this and took the leash off my collar, and then I waved my hand, laughed again and took off the collar as well. I touched my bare neck and smiled, I hadn&#8217;t felt so free in days. I went to the bathroom and after that I walked out of her room. 
I knew that I couldn&#8217;t escape the property, but I also knew that I would enjoy the pleasant feeling of freedom while I had it. It wouldn&#8217;t be long until someone would find me and put me in my place again, but the situation wouldn&#8217;t change from the one I was already in. 
The halls were quiet as death itself and I stayed on the second floor and explored. There was a murmur that I finally recognized and I followed it. My ears led me to a door at the other end of the hall and as I pressed my ear against it, this is how the conversation followed.
�I&#8217;m not afraid. I already said this to you. I know we are all going to die here. I&#8217;m going to fight, and if I lose it will not change anything,� said a familiar voice.
Immediately, I recognized it as Abigail&#8217;s voice. But this time it did not have the same meek, quiet tone as it had so many times before. She spoke louder and with a powerful tone.
�I love you, I want you to try. If there is nothing else for you to live for; fight for me. I know we will die here, but I want us to die together,� said another.
This time it was Matthew and he too had a different tone; more gentle and caring than ever before.
�Don&#8217;t say these things to me,� she whined.
�I&#8217;ll say them again and again. I know you&#8217;re feeling weaker, but this cannot be your last fight, please train and prepare yourself. Have hope and try your hardest. Don&#8217;t let this weekend be the last,� he begged.
�I won&#8217;t train, but I&#8217;ll try. Fate will decide what is going to happen to me,� she said.
And as she spoke I felt a cold, thin hand wrap around my neck. My heart skipped a beat as I stood motionless, with my ear against the door and that hand against my skin.
�Look what we have here; a stray little pet, running around the house, listening for secrets and most importantly; disobeying her mistress,� Jasmine purred as she ran her hot lips against the back of my ear. 
I was too scared for my punishment to come, to think to clearly about her seductive manner. She was behind me and I couldn&#8217;t tell if her eyes were filled with wicked anger towards me or pleasure in catching her disobedient slave so off guard. I let go of the door and she turned me to face her, taking me by the chin again. I felt small when she held my face with her two fingers; I&#8217;ve gotten accustomed to feeling small. Her burning eyes were eating at mine; my heart was racing and my stomach had dropped. 
�Oh, you&#8217;re such a bad pet, obviously you still haven&#8217;t learned your place, but it will just have to make a little more time and a little more punishment. Now, get on your knees, face up against this wall, I want your nose to be touching that wall,� she said.
She threw me down to the ground and pressed my face against the side wall of the hall. I scrambled to my knees and pushing my nose against the wall, closing my eyes and trying to focus. I heard her knock on the door, open it and close behind her. There was silence and a moment for me to collect my thoughts. I wished that I could return to my dream world of submission. Where I didn&#8217;t have to think or worry about what was happening, where all I had to think was that I had to please my master or mistress. But I was awake now and I saw how silly all of this was, so I just stood up after collecting my thoughts and walked away. 
I kept walking, watching the blur of the house pass by me. I made my way down stair and I could see the some servants watching me as I passed, but none of them stopped me. It was either they knew that I would learn my lesson or that they sympathized for me and knew that there was only so much torture I would take before I would run. In a way I was trying to run away, but I wasn&#8217;t physically running; I was just walking with a glazed over look towards life. I managed to walk out the front door without anyone stopping me, or even trying too. 
It was warm outside; the same kind of warmth that had greeted me when I had come out earlier, but this time it was dark outside and I felt more freedom that way. In minutes I had reached the gate. It was a tall metal gate with spikes at the top of it; and it fence ran in to both sides of me as far as I could tell. I followed the gravel road to the end of it and as I was about to reach for the gate something clicked. It sounded like the gate locking; then a small, high pitched noise ran past my ears. I felt pressure on my ankles and wrists as my bracelets gained weight and they flung as they were intended to be. Once my ankles clung together I hit the ground. And as I lay disbursed with my hands held together in front of me and my ankles locked tightly, I started to feel the pull of the four magnets begging to all be together, I quickly gave in, due to my helpless despair and my knees bent it giving way for my wrists and ankles to meet. 
I was now in a little tight ball, with my back curling in. I felt one last surge of energy as my body turned against my will and the animal inside of me tried to break free of my bondage. Once I was back to being human, I felt even weaker and more defeated and fatigued than before. My mind had escaped back into the dream world of submission and I vowed to myself to never go against my master&#8217;s wishes as long as I could help it. I knew that some one would come fore me soon and I would be ready to take the punishment and follow all of the rules. I learned to hate reality as I lay on the gravel road; I only made me more furious and mischievous. I would behave and be a good pet. 
There was no way to stop the tears that came to my eyes; I didn&#8217;t know whether they were from remorse or hate or desperation to escape. But it wasn&#8217;t long until they dried up and someone came to help me. They were two man servants from inside and I heard the click and the high pitched noise as they stood over me. Then the links released and I spread out on the ground weakly.
�Are you going to behave and follow us without resistance or will we need to escort you back to the building?� asked one man.
When I looked at him I recognized his face, but we had never formally met. The other man was the man who had helped me earlier and had spoken of his pity towards me. I couldn&#8217;t remember his name, or even if he had ever introduced himself. He smiled secretly and I got up to my feet, he gave me false inspiration to continue.
They walked at my sides as we went back into the building and then I followed them as they led me to a room I had not gone into before. When we entered, it looked like a small theater with five seats in the front row and another five behind. It was at a slope and faced a semi-large projection screen. The room was dimly lit and desolate. The movie hadn&#8217;t started yet; I assumed that the household was still having dinner. They had me sit down at the far end of the room, in the middle of the aisle that did not have a door at the end of it. 
�You won&#8217;t be in a restraint here, but try to resist the urge to leave, it will only cause you more suffering if you do,� my friend said and the two left.
After a few minutes they returned with a small black box. They placed it a few feet away from me and left again. I noticed that it was not locked, but I chose to leave it un-open to save my self any further anxiety. 
It only took minutes for the whole group to come it. I assumed that they all came straight from dinner, since the whole party came all at once. Alfred came in first, followed by his wife and the three others. None of them noticed me at first because I was seated below chair level. The two man servants followed after and announced that I was seated at the right side aisle. It was the one again the far wall. 
�Well, do what you want with her Jasmine, she is your problem today; she was left under your care and disobeyed your orders. If she was under my watch, that would never happen,� Alfred said as he took a seat in the front row. His wife sat at his side. 
Abigail and Matthew sat at the second row and Jasmine immediately came over to me. She stood so tall over me, her long, smooth legs showing through the tall slit of her glistening gray dress. I made eye contact with her as soon as possible; I already knew that she expected eye contact when she spoke to me. She knew that her eyes could dig deeper into my soul than her words. 
�You were being such a good girl; I was going to let you enjoy the movie with the rest of us. But now it seems that you&#8217;re not going to have that treat. I&#8217;d send you to my room for the rest of the evening, but you can&#8217;t even be trusted with that. So I&#8217;ll keep you here, but I&#8217;m sure you won&#8217;t be a bother,� she whispered.
I knew that the others didn&#8217;t enjoy this torture as much as she did and she didn&#8217;t want to distract them as the movie began. The lights grew dark, but she was so close, I could still see her. And her dark figure looked so strong and tempting against the bright screen of the movie. She bent over me and opened the box. She pulled out a large roll of duct tape and I watched as she wrapped it around my ankles, tying them together. But she did not break the tape once she was finished; instead, she continued to wrap it around my legs, starting at the bottom and going up. Once she got about mid-thigh, she let the roll of tape hang and pulled out a large dildo from the box, she pushed it slowly into my folds. I let out a heavy sigh as it penetrated me and I couldn&#8217;t control the initial pleasure I immediately felt. Then she softly rolled me over onto my tummy and pushed a vibrator into my ass. 
She rolled me back over, separated the lips of my snatch and pressed a smaller vibrator against my clit. After pushing on the vibrator a couple more times just to make sure it was securely in place, she began to wrap the tape around my body again. She took extra time and energy to secure the vibrators and dildo in place with the tape and tightly tied my thighs together lock everything. Then she tied my hands and wrists together behind my back and worked up my waist and chest, securing my arms to the sides and back of me. But she left my breasts exposed and attached heavy large clips to them. She flicked them a couple times for pure pleasure and I felt sweat start to roll down my temples. She finally came up to my neck with tape. Rolled it around a couple times and ripped it. 
�Here comes the fun part,� she whispered and kissed me.
She pulled out a gag and pushed it in my mouth. She tied it behind my head and then she pulled out some soft ear plugs which she pushed into my ears. Finally she set a soft veil over my eyes and I felt her start covering my face with tape. She wrapped it over the veil on my eyes and over my ears, securing the plugs in place and finally over the gag and my mouth, just in case I had some liberty to breath. All I had left in exposure were my nose and breasts, and as soon as she was done I felt utterly alone. 
The darkness and inconsistency of senses began to drive me insane; I couldn&#8217;t see or hear or touch anything with my immovable hands. My tongue tried to explore the gag, but it was large and didn&#8217;t give it very much room to move. The only thing I could truly sense was the pulse around my womanhood, and the pressure it beating inside my anus. I felt my weary tits, numb and in desperate pain from the clips that bullied them. The tape was making my body hot and sweaty. My nervousness and lust for pleasure was making my body hot and sweaty, I couldn&#8217;t really decipher my pain and discomfort from the raging horniness anymore.&nbsp; 
I don&#8217;t know how much time went on this way. The vibrations pulsed through my body begging to climax, to release, to orgasm. But there was something missing and I couldn&#8217;t get there alone like I had before. All of this was a tease, a build up to something that hadn&#8217;t yet come and I tossed back and forth with my mummy-like body begging to finish, but the vibrations just continued on peacefully, teasing me. 
I knew that the movie ended when I felt someone scoop me up from the ground and carry me. I didn&#8217;t know who it was, but someone strong enough. The walk was long, or maybe it just felt that way because I was in a cocoon. They lye my body down on the ground and I felt her cold hands touch my breasts. I recognized Jasmines thin fingers as she ran them over my open skin. By now I was so sensitive towards touch I could barely keep my body from exploding inside of me. My thoughts and senses were all focused on her traveling fingers as she paused and started pulling lightly on one of the clips. It was such and innocent gesture, but it sent shock waves through my body. I quivered and I knew she had noticed. She stopped immediately and did it to the other one. Sweat began to seep from my pores again. My nose was barely keeping up with my need to breathe heavily. She took of the clip and pinched my puckered nipple. Rolled it around in her fingers and watched as I squirmed helplessly. 
How could she have such an impact on me? But she did and I lusted after her more than I had ever towards anyone. She pulled off the other one and did the same. Then she stopped and in a moment I felt some cold object against my skin, moving; it was a pair of scissors and she easily cut the wet duct tape off my skin. She pulled it all off it except for the covers of my face. She pulled out the vibrators and dildo and I felt at ease, forgetting about the sexual suffering. 
After all of this, she sat beside me and took my hand closest to her and held it in both of hers. Mine was sweaty and warm, while hers were cold and stern. She moved my hand over her face; her closed eyes and her lips. This felt so wonderful and I let my imagination fill in for what I couldn&#8217;t see; the texture of her soft, delicate skin and her plump wet lips. She took some of my fingers into her mouth and played with them; letting her tongue roll over them and her teeth bit down lightly. While they were still wet, she led them out of her mouth and down her neck. Finally they landed on one of her breasts. She was naked.
I took over and explored her large, sensitive breasts, taking time to play with her nipples, letting her guide me at times. I was so lost on the map of her body; my senses were flawed and I was completely consumed with wherever my fingers went. I let her run them down her belly and finally they slipped in between her folds. I could only imagine what I was touching. I knew that my fingers were now massaging the small bulb that was her clitoris, but I couldn&#8217;t tell if she was enjoying it, I couldn&#8217;t see her face.&nbsp; I let my fingers continue to explore, running them against the silky wet walls and into the ever deepening hole; circling them around and touching every wall of her inside, finding her g-spot and petting it firmly with the tips of my fingers. She had moved her own hands away and had let me wander.
When I pulled out, she let my hand drop and pulled my tape off my face slowly; Uncovering my eyes and ears first and leaving the mouth gag in. I stared at her marvelous body anxiously. She took the collar off the floor and waved it above my lying head. 
�You are my slave,� she announced and put the collar back on.
�Do you want to please your mistress?� she asked.
I wanted to do anything for her. She had captivated me in a way that no one ever had. It was all a mix of things found in a dream; she was beautiful and strong and I adored the way she controlled me. She had a way about her; this type of unfailing confidence. And I was caught in between an actual fondness of her and some sort of mind game building up inside of me that created lust inside my heart and pointed towards her to fulfill it. I felt that making her happy was all that I wanted to do; that I was completely and utterly infatuated with her now. And I loved the way the collar felt against my skin again; I was her slave. 
I nodded my head in agreement to her question.
She smiled; kind and warm, less devious and painful than before. She untied the gag and pulled it out of my mouth, giving me a minute to breathe. 
�Please me, slave,� she said and gently sprawled out onto the floor.
I sat up and looked over her free and beautiful body; her hair flowing free into the floor. Her eyes were shut and she trusted me in pleasing her properly. I leaned in and spread her legs lightly, while her knees stayed bent. I pulled those naked, wet lips apart with my fingers to get a clear view and pressed my mouth against her clit. I flicked it with my tongue and sucked, and then I repeated the motion, switching it up again and again. I let go, wet my fingers with the juices that were leaking out of her hole and rolled them over the clit. I played with it, pinching and rolling and nibbling on it sometimes. And once in a while I would push my free hand&#8217;s fingers into her hole and pump in and out setting off a surge through her body and listening to her moan in pleasure.
It didn&#8217;t take long for her body to start quivering and her legs to start shaking. Sometimes she would take my head in her hands and rub it softly, encouraging me and finally when her hips were in the air and she was moving with my motions, I put in some extra energy and she gave way. She groaned in full satisfaction and let her legs drop on either side of me. I looked up at her but her eyes were closed. I crawled towards her and let my mouth land on one of her tits, playing with it and nibbling on it, kissing her chest and then her neck, sucking on her ear and finally, with sighs of approval, kissing her lips. 
They were moist and shaking, but still confident and firm. She wrapped her hands around my neck and pulled me in, letting my tongue sink in deeper and meeting hers. They played with each other; her hot lips sucking on mine, occasional biting. And then I heard the door open. I looked up instinctively and saw Abigail at the door.
She wore a light, silky robe and heels, her hair was up and the way she looked, with so much surprise discouraged me. It was a mixed stare of awe and hate and jealousy. She started to move towards us and I looked back down at my mistress for some direction. She smiled and lightly pushed me off of her.
�On your knees, girl,� she ordered.
I scrambled onto my knees, feeling betrayed and alone again. I let my eyes fall to the ground as Jasmine stood up to greet Abigail. The trust I had built in her had diminished; I had just built some sort of fantasy. And now I felt angry and again I felt just like an object. And out of all of those feelings, I felt jealousy the most. I wanted to be Abigail; I wanted to stand on my own two feet and go about as I pleased and have Jasmine greet me so kindly, like she greeted her old lover. 
They embraced each other and I heard their wet lips kissing and their heavy breathing; lusting for each other. I saw Abigail&#8217;s robe drop lightly to the ground and they moved to the bed. I lifted my eyes to watch the two girls jump onto the bed and Jasmine hover over Abigail. She pulled a strap on out of the drawer from night stand and attached it to herself. She thrust Abigail harshly against the soft sheets and penetrated her in a vicious way. The girl screamed. She screamed with pleasure, she loved the way Jasmine treated her. She was jealous of me and my position; she wanted to be used and abused. But it wasn&#8217;t the same, at the end of the night Abigail would be able to leave and roam freely around, while I would still be at my knees. And I doubt she wanted the slow torture that came with the job, she just wanted the raw dominance right there in the moment. 
Jasmine tossed her over onto her belly and started fucking her from behind, up her ass doggy style. The girl moaned without regret, and Jasmine wasn&#8217;t going to stop until she came. Jasmine was doing this purely for Abigail&#8217;s pleasure and they soon switched positions again. She let Abigail ride her strap on as she lay back and watched the sweaty girl pleasure herself. She turned and rode her backwards. Then Jasmine got her up and they fucked; both standing on their knees, finally Jasmine threw her down again and slowed everything down as she pumped her from behind. The girl finally came and let out a cry of pleasure. Collapsing below Jasmine&#8217;s strong body and resting her face on the sheets. Jasmine took off the strap on and threw it to the floor. She looked at me and waved me over to the bed. 
I came up and crawled onto the scrambled sheets, letting the fabric caress my legs. This all felt more and more like a dream. Nothing existed anymore except for Jasmine and Abigail. The sheets entangled us all and brought us together. The moon glittered brightly and landed its light directly onto the bed. I hadn&#8217;t noticed it while I was kneeling, but now it was more beautiful than ever. Nothing else mattered, the rest of the room was too dark too see. My thoughts of my old life and freedom and anything in between vanished. All I could think of was Jasmines firm lips and glowing body, her strong shoulders and loose hair. The way her eyes passed over me, lusting for me the same way that I was lusting for her. She now knew the type of pleasure I could bring her, the same pleasure she had brought Abigail only a minute ago; the same pleasure that had crippled her and now she lay weak and dominated. 
She crept towards me on all fours and pushed me down onto the sheets. I let my head rest on a pillow as she crawled on top of me and began to kiss my neck; letting her teeth sink in occasionally. My breathing was deep and I kept my eyes focused on the soft skin of her neck and shoulder; letting my fingers caress her as she captivated me.&nbsp; I felt her put her knee in between my legs and spread them gently as she continued to kiss me; moving up to my lips; embracing me, letting her hands glide over my head. I felt fingers press into my womanhood, pumping lightly and it baffled me. The attention of more than one person astonished and aroused me. I had been stimulated earlier, so my need for an orgasm was at an all time high. It gave in as soon as those wet fingers rubbed vigorously against my clit. I moaned without hesitation and sank deeper into the soft bed. Jasmine crawled off of me when she was satisfied; knowing that my first orgasm would come fast, because of her little project earlier.&nbsp; She kissed Abigail and they both swept me in. 
All three of us started into a kissing and licking frenzy, using our hands and mouths to explore each other; letting the moonlight and our sweat bring us together. I soon found myself under the sheets with them, one behind me and other in front. We made a perfect womanly circle as we pleasured each other, constantly receiving and giving. I was so lost in it, I didn&#8217;t know who was where; orgasm after orgasm. Then we would scramble around again, kissing and touching and staring at each other. Pleasure again; trying to get one another to cum, as if it was a game to see who could do it the most. I lost track and finally it was very late. 
They held me in between them as we all drifted off and I really did believe it all to have been a dream.





Chapter 4


When the sun rose, we rose. Everyone had slept in, but none of that mattered, none of us had anywhere to go. My freedom was obsolete as the day progressed; Jasmine was happy and preoccupied and let me do whatever I felt like. I ate breakfast and lunch in the kitchen and went down to read in the library for the largest part of the day, joining the rest of the household for dinner.&nbsp; I sat at my normal place and listened in to conversations buzzing around the room. Abigail was having her fight tonight. Everyone was going to see it except for Alfred&#8217;s wife and myself. I didn&#8217;t mind not going, it didn&#8217;t really interest me and Alfred&#8217;s wife refused to go. 
They all dressed up and left in the late evening and I spent the rest of the time alone finding myself in the library again.
�Oh, I didn&#8217;t know you were in here,� Amber said as she walked into the library.
Although she was surprised, she went over to one of the shelves to find herself a book anyway. Once she had found something, she sat down on the couch across from me. There was a long pause when we did not speak to each other. I lost interest in my book, which couldn&#8217;t hold my attention anyway and would let my eyes wander up and stare at her once in a while. She was thin, but strong. The way she held her posture showed high class and elegance. Her hair was pinned up tight and her face was even tighter. Although she looked too reserved for her own good, her eyes and lips resembled youth. There was something still living in her eyes and lightly moving lips that told a story; no doubt, a beautiful love story between her and Alfred that I would never know. She gave off an air about her that she always had money and that Alfred was now the sole provider of that money. She never bothered him about anything he said or did and didn&#8217;t seem to care, as long as she was comfortable in her living. 
She caught one of my stray stares and smiled, taking it as an opportunity to talk to me.
�What is it?� her voice was neither pleasant nor irritated.
�I&#8217;m sorry,� I said.
I knew that it wasn&#8217;t my place to talk or disturb her in her reading and I let my eyes fall back onto the pages of my book.
�Oh really, let&#8217;s not do this. I&#8217;m not like my husband or Jasmine, or even Abigail, who I&#8217;m starting to wonder about. I&#8217;m not going to hurt you if you chose to have a civil conversation with me. Anna, I don&#8217;t see you the way they do, I see you as a beautiful young girl lost in an awkward situation,� she said honestly and put her book down.
�Can you help me get out of here?� I whispered.
�That I cannot, I wish I could, but I am too selfish for my own good. You are here for the pleasure of this house&#8217;s residents. If I were to release you, no one would trust me, especially my husband, who is far more important to me,� she said.
She looked disappointed at the words that came out of her mouth. I watched as she traced the border of the book with her fingertips.
�Could I do something else for you?� she asked.
�Nothing,� I said.
I finally noticed the strange alterations in my voice and speech. Over this short period of time, I had learned to speak less and more meekly than ever before. I was had blocked out most of the thoughts in my head, the same thoughts that used to blare out of my mouth as soon as I would speak. But now that I had the choice to say what I wanted to, I chose to say nothing.
�Do you absolutely hate it here?� she asked.
I wondered if she was just thinking about something to ask for the time to pass between us; or if this was all going somewhere. I thought about her question for a minute, taking my time to answer. If it had been the day before, I would have screamed yes, but now there was a vague doubt in my mind. I had learned to accept my fate; knowing that I would have to learn to love it or die inside. I never thought that I would actually be somewhat happy. I had a roof over my head; and a large one at that, I had food and company and I had Jasmine. She was all that I could think about and I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily want to leave her. Abigail was sweat enough, Matthew wouldn&#8217;t bother with me and my master; well, my master hadn&#8217;t bothered me last night. 
I realized that it was pure instinct to say that I wanted to run away, that I wanted Amber&#8217;s help in my escape. But truthfully I didn&#8217;t really want to leave anymore. The new freedom that I had been entrusted with made me feel like that wouldn&#8217;t be so bad after all. And there was always the thought of where I would go, if I were free. Back home? To Frankie&#8217;s? None of those places felt right.
�I don&#8217;t hate it. I&#8217;m just transitioning I guess. One part of me wants to leave and the other is starting to make itself at home,� I answered.
�If you can put the first part of you away for one night and give me reason to trust you, I&#8217;ll take you out to town with me. I&#8217;m quite bored with myself and there&#8217;s isn&#8217;t much to do for the rest of the night. I wouldn&#8217;t mind your company,� she said.
I smiled, the idea of leaving the house, if only for one night delighted me.
�Where were you thinking about going?�
�Just out, wherever that may be,� she said and a wicked smile rolled over her lips.
�I&#8217;m meeting some friends in town and we&#8217;ll be going from one place to another,� she said.
�I would really like,� I said.
�I&#8217;m just warning you, girl, that if you do try to run, Alfred will find you at any cost. He has plenty of reason for this; one being that you could easily exploit him, another would be that he would see your escape as a game. He&#8217;s a sadistic man, that&#8217;s why we don&#8217;t get along very well; I&#8217;m not willing to play his games. But he won&#8217;t stop at anything to win you back,� she informed me.
I gulped and agreed with her. 
She smiled youthfully and stood up, she waved at me to follow her and we went out of the room and up the stairs to the third floor, back to master bedroom. It was lit beautifully this time, with hand crafted furniture and raw paintings on the walls. I hadn&#8217;t ever seen the room in the light and it resembled nothing that it was when the lights were off. She threw open her wardrobe and started shuffling through dresses, she pulled out a couple with inspiration on her face and put them back again. Finally she found a thin, long, glittering black dress with a slit up the side, thin shoulder straps and an open back. 
�Try this one on,� she said and tossed it towards me.
I slipped the fabric on letting it glide over me. It fit almost perfectly, but the sides were a little loose. She came over and pinned them carefully. The dress was great, it made me feel beautiful. But the rest of my body was bare. She smiled and gave me some shoes to match, and after she had found a golden dress for herself she escorted me to the bathroom. There she groomed her hair and talked about odd little things to pass the time. I didn&#8217;t have hair and it made me awkward to watch her play with hers. Finally we started with the makeup and she took the time to apply a healthy coat onto my face. Then, she got to work on hers and we were done in a few minutes. Both of us faced the mirror. I saw myself as beautiful for once, with the dress and the great makeup job she had done. 
�There&#8217;s one thing missing; jewelry,� she said.
She opened her marble jewelry box; which was on the counter, and pulled out pair of long diamond earrings. Putting them on my ears, she let me face the mirror again. The earrings added to the shape of my face and actually made my hairless head look elegant. She took off the ragged training collar and put on a single strand of diamonds, which was only long enough to sit at the center of my neck, becoming my neck elegant collar. 
�Perfect,� she said as she put on jewelry to match her dress.
�We&#8217;re all ready.�
The clock read a little past ten; which seemed late to be going out to town. Although I wasn&#8217;t sure of their culture and I was only sixteen, turning seventeen. She went downstairs and as we were about to leave she pulled out a key from he small bag, opened a little door to a stand that was near the main door. Pulled out a small remote and used it to unlock my tiny shackles. She took all four and placed them into the same drawer, locking it again. The servants led us outside and a black, old fashioned car pulled up to greet us. We crawled into the back and it drove off into the night.
It took about a half and hour to reach town. I finally noticed street lights through the tinted windows and smiled at the civilization. There were people and stores and restaurants. These people and places were completely unaware of who we really were and where we had come from. The ignorance gave my body a chill; how many more conspiracies were out there?
We reached our destination and the driver escorted us out of the car and to the door of the building. It looked like a casual bar, dark windows and glowing light. We entered inside to see a couple tables and chairs, and a long bar strip with a couple visitors. It didn&#8217;t look like anything too fancy and we passed by without any notice. Actually, it was strange how very little notice we were receiving. If any of the attendants stared up at us, they would quickly look back down without hesitation. As we reached the back we took a turn towards the bathroom. We passed those and went up some stairs. The walls were painted black and so were the stairs; it was desolate and growing more quiet.
At the top there was a locked door and a tiny green light. Amber pulled out a small object that resembled a card and waved it over the light. It made a click and the door unlocked. She turned the handle and we walked in. The inside room was large; it looked like someone&#8217;s living room in an average to large sized apartment. There were remnants of a kitchen were a bar now stood. The walls were painted black as well and dim lights appeared in little bulbs at the corners of the floors against the walls. The furniture on the other hand was white, all white and there were tall glasses scattered about the room. There was no one at the bar to serve, but there two people sitting on the couch, talking quietly. Music play lightly in the distance, the rare windows looked over the city.
One of the people on the couch, who happened to be a man, looked up at us.
�Hello,� he said happily and stood up to walk towards us.
The woman, who was sitting with him, hesitantly stood up to follow the man.
�Amber, it&#8217;s been a while. You know you should come around more often,� he said, coming over and hugging her.
�My husband&#8217;s out of the house with the rest of his little people. I thought I&#8217;d go out to town,� she said and laughed lightly.
�Well, you came to the right place. It&#8217;s definitely not going to be as crazy as last time, but the regulars will be here,� he said.
He was dressed formally in a black suit and the woman with him was dressed up just us much as us.
�Who is this?� he asked, running his hand over my cheek.
I blushed, but I doubt that he noticed in the dark light. It shocked me about how open he was with himself and my personal space.
�Oh, this is just the little slave Al picked up. I thought I&#8217;d take her with me. She won&#8217;t bother anyone. Her name is Annabelle,� she said and brushed me off.
He wasn&#8217;t ready to do the same.
�A slave? Will she be your slave tonight or is she going to have fun with the rest of us?� he asked.
I looked up at him and the woman; they both had the same expression on their face, pure curiosity and a little bit of lust.
�Oh, she&#8217;s not my slave! You can play with her, as long as she doesn&#8217;t mind. I don&#8217;t want to have to answer to Alfred if the word slips out from her mouth. She&#8217;s not anyone&#8217;s slave tonight,� she answered and walked away from me.
I watched as she went over to the bar and made her self a drink. They both closed in on me and I pressed up against the door. My mind was racing, but once again I was lost in some sort of dream world. I looked at the faces, going back and forth between the two. They resembled each other in a way; both had dark brown hair and heavy, deep eyes. Both were slender and generally young; early thirties at the most. They both started petting me and I was confused by the gestures and the luscious smells coming from their skin; one so feminine and the other very masculine.
�Oh stop it, you two! She won&#8217;t say no, the poor girls been beat and trained. Let her have some room,� Amber said as she came back.
They cleared some space for her to enter the little circle and she handed me a drink. It was crystal blue and sat calmly inside one of those tall glasses.
�Just drink it,� she said as she saw my confused expression.
The door clicked and we all got out of the way to let another person in. This time it was a young man, mid twenties and he immediately smiled as he saw Amber. They hugged and he gave her a kiss on the cheek. Two other women came in after him and they greeted the other three with warmth and pleasure. Everyone was dressed to go to a ball, but I was sure that they weren&#8217;t going anyway. I escaped from them and wandered and into the hall; I found a bathroom and turned the light on. The brightness burned for a second and then I stared at myself in the mirror. My cheeks were flushed and I was nervous, but still beautiful; even more so with my vivid red cheeks. I looked around the bathroom to see that it was elegant and clean and spacious. I relieved myself and went back into the darkness. 
When I came back the group had disbursed. A couple people I didn&#8217;t recognize were making drinks and looked up at me with big smiles. I waved my drink in my hand, assuring them that I was taken care of. I took a sip of the blue drink, but it didn&#8217;t taste like anything I had before. I could taste the alcohol though, even if it wasn&#8217;t much. I entered another room and found Amber, the young man and the couple that had greeted me lounging on a couple large couches. I was about to leave when the older man spoke.
�Oh, don&#8217;t leave, come over here, sit by us,� he said.
I hesitated, but I felt obligated since he had already asked and I had nowhere to go so I sat down in between the two where they had made space for me. Across the way, near the door where I had come through a projection was playing on the screen. The room was dimly lit like the others, but the music in this room was a tiny bit louder and the pictures on the screen were eccentric.&nbsp; 
�Do you like this music,� the man asked.
I didn&#8217;t recognize it.
�I don&#8217;t know who it is,� I admitted.
The waves of voice and instrument were delicate and entrancing.
�It doesn&#8217;t matter who it is, all that matters is if you enjoy how it sounds,� he said.
�I like it,� I said.
He glanced down at my drink and took it out of my hands. He waved it in the air and finally said, �It doesn&#8217;t look like you&#8217;ll be drinking tonight.�
His lady friend laughed.
�You don&#8217;t drink?� she asked lightly, her voice was soothing.
�I&#8217;ve never drunk. I mean I don&#8217;t drink at all,� I said.
�That&#8217;s alright. Do you want to try something else?� the man asked.
I glanced at the lady when her lips curled up. They exchanged looks.
�Here tilt your head back,� he said and I followed his command.
�Open up your mouth and stick you tongue out. That&#8217;s it, you&#8217;ve got it. Now just hold it like that for a second,� he said. 
I felt something sprinkle onto my tongue and I shut my mouth immediately and sat back up. The crumbs on my tongue either dissolved or were swallowed up before I could spit them out. All I had left was a strong bitter taste. The deed was done.
�What was that?� I asked.
They both laughed and exchanged looks again.
�Don&#8217;t even worry. Here&#8217;s your drink, sip on it for a while,� he said.
They left the room immediately and I watched the screen awkwardly and nervously as Amber and the young man talked. The two women than accompanied him came into the room and sat on either side of me. They introduced themselves, but I was too worried about my own situation to really pay attention to their names. They talked and laughed and tried to involve me in their conversations, but I wasn&#8217;t having it. Two more people entered, two men, who I didn&#8217;t recognize. Introducing themselves to the three of us they sat on either side of the girls. Two rapid conversations started on their side of me and I wasn&#8217;t involved in those. After about a good hour of aimless words and conversations, the never ending music and the pictures on the screen I decided that I felt exactly the same and stood up to use the bathroom again. 
But a sudden rush came over me and I had to sit back down again. I handed my half sipped drink over to one of the girls that had just finished hers and held my head in my hands. The room was going around in circles and my hands were burning up my face. I stood up again and weaved out of the room, having to hold onto walls to keep my balance. I walked passed the bar, noticing a small crowd in the living room and went towards the bathroom. But before I could make it, I felt two large hands on my bare shoulders. 
�Annabelle!� the voice said.
It was the man from before and his lady friend was soon to follow as she appeared in front of me. He held me stiffly by the shoulders as she came nearer to my face.
�How are you feeling, honey?� she asked.
�I&#8217;m a little confused,� the words seems to morph into one long word in my head.
The laughed and turned me away from the bathroom. I had forgotten all about it by now.
�We&#8217;re going on an adventure through the city, do you want to come?� she asked.
I couldn&#8217;t deny her. They took that as a yes and led me out of the front door with them. The sounds from the bar were beating against my ears as we came down the stairs. I didn&#8217;t remember the music being so loud. My vision was getting clearer as we went passed the bar and outside into the cool air. It was sharp against my skin and I felt it travel down my throat and into my lungs. They hurried me down the streets and I couldn&#8217;t help but let my eyes wander at all the bright lights and city windows. They were illuminating and blaring against my vision, leaving behind any darkness. We made it to another bar.
�Sammie, my good man, let us in!� the man said loudly.
The door man looked at me and as he did, the lady took my hand.
�Oh, she&#8217;s with us. Twenty two, you met her before,� he said.
We all knew that I had never seen this man and he had never met me, but he stepped aside immediately. Inside the air was thick, the man paid our way in and we all grabbed some seats. It was a strip club. I had never been in one and never intended to go, but here we were. The colorful lights flashed playfully from the ceiling and caught my attention, they drew over to one of the girls dancing on stage and making friends with her pole. I watched her glistening body with new adoration. My company was chatty with another girl and soon enough she was dancing, giving them a couple&#8217;s dance. I chose not to pay attention. 
Another girl came on stage; she was even more alluring than the one before. My eyes were pressed on her body. All reality had faded away. I wasn&#8217;t thinking about the sketchy strip joint of where these ladies were from, all I could do was appreciate her long, healthy glistening body as she danced. The music ended and she caught my eyes. I knew that she had been watching me before, the same way that I was watching her, but my mind had drifted away and now it was back again. The contact was made. I stood up and walked towards her as she stepped off stage.
�Do you want a dance?�
I nodded.
�Its fifty bucks,� she said.
 Her voice was raspy.
�I don&#8217;t have money,� the words came out of my mouth.
It was strange how my words were never predetermined and that when they came out of my mouth it was as if I was listening to myself.
�Who are you here with?� she asked.
�Those two,� I said and pointed.
She noticed not one, but two strippers entertaining them now.
�They&#8217;ll have fifty bucks,� she said.
�Probably,� I agreed.
We walked up to them as the two girls were just finishing up.
�You&#8217;re little friend wants a dance, but she doesn&#8217;t have the cash; you willing to spare?� she asked coldly.
�Anny, wouldn&#8217;t you rather have one of these pretty ladies?� he said and the two girls giggled and waved.
I liked the rude one, because she could care less about me.
�I want this one,� I said.
They paid her and she took my hand. She led me past the bar and into a quiet room. The walls had red velvet curtains draping down them and a cold seat in the middle. She left the door slightly open. I sat down and she turned a knob on the wall near the light switch. Some music began to play. I couldn&#8217;t understand what it was, but I felt the beat pulsing through my veins. She started dancing and I watched her smooth, tan skin rolling in every direction. Soon she was so close I could smell her. She kissed my neck, but I didn&#8217;t react, she bit me and waves of energy rolled through my body.
�You like it rough?� she asked teasingly.
�I do?� I was confused.
�Oh god, you&#8217;re ridiculous,� she said started dancing again.
The music ended and she leaned over me. 
�You know, this is totally against policy, but if your friend over there had a couple more fifties I wouldn&#8217;t mind coming over to your place and playing a little with you,� she said.
I was repelled at the idea of having her become more than what she was now and disagreed. She shrugged and walked out of the room. I followed and met up with my two friends, they were ready to leave. We went outside into the cold air and found ourselves in a market place. There were several vendors still open this late, a hot dog stand and a pretzel stand. I got a pretzel and devoured it. 
The salt and soft warm bread tickled my cheeks and taste buds. I had never eaten anything so delicious before. It had been the same pretzel as always, but this time is was amazing. I was completely full, but got another one just to have those powerful sensations roll over me again. 
�It&#8217;s getting late, better head back,� he said.
The streets were none sense to my eyes as he found our way back. The words made no sense, I couldn&#8217;t read them, but the colors spoke. My company knew the way back, even if I didn&#8217;t, and in no time we were back inside the black apartment. Most of the crowd had cleared out. We made our way to the back room and found about six people watching a movie. We crammed ourselves in on the floor and I was squeezed into the middle again. I didn&#8217;t recognize what the movie was, and I didn&#8217;t care. I was tired and soon my eyes were drifting. 
Before I could sail off to dream land I felt a soft hand caress my neck, but I kept my eyes closed, pretending I was still asleep. Her lips moved to my ear and nibbled on it lightly, it felt incredible, the stirred up sensations made my body quiver lightly. I tried to pass myself off as asleep and rolled away from her, grunted and smacked my lips, as if I was deeply sleeping. I felt him pick me up and walk me away from the movie. I kept still and I heard the door open and close and slightly opened my eyes to see where we were. He had brought me into an empty room, and as he lay me down on the bed I thought he was doing a favor for me and putting me to bed. But I noticed the woman standing behind him and became nervous again. I felt him place me on my tummy and unzip my dress from behind. 
Something inside of me screamed for an escape, but whatever I was on made me drowsy and more than relaxed. I rubbed my cheek against the smooth, silky sheets as he pulled the dress off of me. My eyes stayed shut and I thought about the stripper and soft pretzels and the street lights as he undid my shoes and pulled them off. He let me lay there motionless as I listened to the couple kissing and undressing each other. The zippers and belt and shoes came off. She straddled me and leaned in closely to whisper into my ears.
�Wake up little one; we&#8217;re going to have some fun before you run away to dream land,� she spoke softly.
Her hands started to massage my back and my body reacted miserably to the pure pleasure. I opened my eyes and stared at the window next to the bed in a blur. Why wasn&#8217;t this stuff wearing off? I sat up and she slid away from me. I looked over to her to see that her man was massaging her gently. 
�Why am I here? Can&#8217;t I go to sleep?� I tried to argue.
�You don&#8217;t want to sleep; you&#8217;ll miss all of the fun,� she giggled.
�I don&#8217;t want to be a part of this,� I said softly.
They didn&#8217;t look discouraged.
�Just try, you&#8217;ll like it,� she promised and crawled towards me.
She slowly plucked my earrings off and placed them on the night stand. Then, she took my face in her hands and started kissing me. Her tongue and lips greeted mine warmly and soon I was in a surge of lust and sexuality. He came in after I had become aroused and we all started kissing each other; taking time to touch and caress; to let the drugs play with our minds and let every skin contact rouse us more. She ran her fingers down to my clit and rubbed it lightly. I&#8217;d never felt so much sensation and adrenaline rush through me. He was doing the same to her and then we switched. I found myself, liking and teasing her tits while someone played with my womanhood. 
It wasn&#8217;t long before I was lost in a frenzy of things. She teased me, I teased her, he played with me, I touched him and her, and her and he went at it and then I was there too. I came back to my senses when I was eating her out and he was fucking me from behind. I remember specifically moaning in hot passion and having to pause for a second as his hard dick took another ram into my ass. Then, I was back again, with my face buried in her beautiful folds. Another time we were both taking turns giving him head, while he used both his hands to pump fingers into out wet cunts, rubbing out clits. When one of us wasn&#8217;t sucking the other would kiss and caress her, or even share, by sucking on his balls. Once in a while we would take a minute to purely kiss each other and nibble on each others nipples; then, we would go back to what we were doing.&nbsp; He finally came inside his woman as he was on top of her and so was I. She was eating me out and he was pumping into her when he gave way.
He stopped and took a break, while us two played with each other a little more and then I said I was tired. She left the room; obviously not ready to call it a night and I instantly fell asleep in the next to the nameless man.
When morning came, I woke up. I woke up! The dream with in the dream that was my life faded away. My vision was clear, my thoughts were clear and I was free. I looked at the man lying next to me. He was dead asleep. Who was this man? I laughed at the thought of having done those things with him the night before. When would I ever in my right mind agree to anything those two got me to do? I picked up the earring and put them on again. I slipped the dress back on and left the room timidly; he didn&#8217;t even stir from his slumber.
The halls outside of the room were quiet. Everyone was still asleep; it was chilly, which indicated that it was still early outside. The living room was not the way I lad seen it the night before. As the sun light shown through the window, I saw a dirty old place with dark maroon paint on the walls and shabby floor. The bar was old, the white furniture was stained and the people crashing around the scene were all old and stained and shabby too. 
Last night was an illusion, these people were just the same as anyone else, this place was elegant in the night and dirty in the day, like some many people in reality. They weren&#8217;t cruel to me; in fact, I enjoyed most of my time, but it had been a lie; to keep me insane and sane at the same time, if that makes any sense. I needed the freedom from my master and mistress to keep my sanity, but that freedom brought me to an illusionary place. I walked past the sleeping people and out the front door.&nbsp; The bar was closed downstairs, but the door opened from the inside out. 
Once I was outside I found out where I was; a suburban town outside of Huston, Texas called Conrow; this was its downtown area. I found the nearest pawn shop, which luckily just opened at 7:00 in the morning. As the owner was opening up I handed him my diamond earring in hope of getting any cash. He was glad to buy them from me for a couple hundred dollars. I knew that they were worth a lot more than that. But I chose not to argue, I would take anything I could get. He had some second hand clothes in a bin and I traded my dress and shoes for a pair of jeans, shirt, hoodie, and shoes that fit. They were an ugly combination but more comfortable and discreet than the dress. The only thing I kept was the necklace, in a memory of that kind woman. 
I found the bus station and took the next ride out to the big city. It was just waking up as we made it to a grey hound. The smog of the city, the dry heat in the Texas air and the tall gray buildings didn&#8217;t amuse me. I bought my ticket to Boise, Idaho and spent a couple hours on the bus before it set off. I had gone from Boise, Idaho to Huston Texas somehow and now all I could think of was going home. It wasn&#8217;t a pleasant thought, but it was a safe thought. Somehow my parents would understand when I tried to explain these things to them. The ride was long. We spent the night somewhere in between states. Then, we continued on. I slept so much, mostly out of boredom and trying to recuperate myself.
Towards the evening, I finally landed in my home town. I took another bus to my parents place and stood staring at the house from the street for a long time. I had made a destination to come home; the same place that I had wanted to run away from so badly. My mind was twisted. I didn&#8217;t want to be a slave, yet I enjoyed the house and company and even the torture sometimes. I wanted to be free, but I hated the perfect little house that I stood in front of, I hated my parents, the community, the school, everything. Could I be a free slave? No, I was given the chance to be free and return to my slavery at the end of the day, but I ran away like some sort of starved, beaten animal. I knew that the trust was gone and that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to return. Why would I want to return? My mind was falling apart and I ran my hands over my prickly head. Warm tears slithered down my cheeks.
�I&#8217;ve gone this far, I&#8217;m not going back home,� I said to myself and walked away from the house.
A couple blocks later, I found myself in front of one of my old friend&#8217;s house. I put my hood on and knocked on her door. It wasn&#8217;t too late for company. She answered and her mouth dropped in surprise.
�Anna!�
She grabbed me and hugged me closely.
�What? Where have you been? You&#8217;ve been missing for months! What the hell?� she was yelling in surprise and astonishment.
�Come in, come in, do your parents know you&#8217;re back?� she asked.
Then she placed her finger over her mouth and smiled wicked.
�Oh, we gotta be quiet, my roommate is sleeping,� she giggled.
I didn&#8217;t know whether she was just talking to herself because she was the only gabbing loudly and the only one who would be responsible for her roommate waking up. She showed me upstairs to her room and invited me to sit down and talk my heart out. The hood slipped off my head and I ran my hand involuntarily over my head. Her eyes got even bigger and her smile wider.
�Did the army kidnap you?� she yelped.
�Beth, they don&#8217;t shave girl&#8217;s heads in the army,� I finally said, unable to hold down my opinion about her stupidity.
�Talk to me,� she begged and held onto my hand.
�It&#8217;s a really long story. I ran away from home and I&#8217;m in a money pinch so I&#8217;m back for a couple of days,� I lied.
�When are you leaving? Where are you going? Where have you been?� she continued her interrogation.
�Oh, Beth, I want to tell you but I&#8217;m so tired. Can I just crash here for the night and tell you all about it tomorrow?� I asked.
�You&#8217;ve changed, Anna, you used to spill your guts about everything. There wasn&#8217;t a time when your thoughts weren&#8217;t constantly pouring out of your head. Why are you so quiet? Why can&#8217;t you talk to me?� she sighed.
�I&#8217;ll tell you tomorrow. I&#8217;ve been on the gray hound for days, give me a break,� I said.
She let go of my hand and swept it over the room.
�It&#8217;s all yours,� she said and got up. 
I pulled my hoodie off and scrambled under her sheets. They felt warm and comforting. 
�Thank you so much,� I said.
She left the room and shut off the lights. My eyes closed and I was asleep again. In the middle of the night I woke up with cold sweat. My dreams were filled with old hateful faces and I didn&#8217;t know where I was. I saw the doctors and nurses, security guards; my master, his family and I saw Jasmine&#8217;s alluring eyes watching me. 
Beth room was quiet and dark, the moon was shining outside; I was suddenly scared and confused. I found the girl sleeping on the floor and woke her up.
�What&#8217;s wrong?� she muttered.
�Can you get in bed with me? I&#8217;m scared,� I cried.
She yawned, got off the floor and under the covers in one fluid motion. She never once asked a question and fell asleep again in seconds. I pressed my body close to hers for protection and fell asleep again.
In the morning, I woke up before her and left without a word. I didn&#8217;t want to explain anything to anyone. It was better if no one knew my situation. My feet took me back to my parents&#8217; house and I wandered into the backyard. I knew they would be at work about this time and peeped in through the glass door just to make sure; desolate. In no time I was trying all the windows behind the house to see if one would open. 
My parents had been precautious, but I found an unlocked window over the kitchen sink. I opened it and crawled inside. It was small, but I was smaller still and managed to scramble in. I jumped over the sink and onto the linoleum floor. From there I began to scavenge the house for anything I might need. I took anything valuable, including cash and jewelry, I changed the clothes I was wearing to something of mine and grabbed some food before I head out again. 
As I ran past the door I paused and stared at the key holder. My mom&#8217;s keys were patiently dangling there, waiting to be picked up. She had left somewhere with my dad or a friend and the car was available for my use. I snagged the keys without thinking twice and dodged into the garage. There it was, and I started up the engine as soon as my butt hit the nice leather. When I began driving, I started thinking about where I would go and how to escape my situation. I didn&#8217;t want to go back to Frankie; it would be a trap, everyone would know how to find me there. So I drove towards the coast. I&#8217;d hit a city, maybe Portland or Seattle, there were plenty of people there who would keep me company and protect me. I couldn&#8217;t stay in any of the states I had already drifted through; it would be too easy for my stalkers to find me. And I wanted to be as far away from Texas as possible. 
The journey was long and I had to spend the night inside the car, but I finally made to over the state border. I left the car on the side of the road about a hundred miles from Portland and got a ride the rest of the way by some people headed my direction. They didn&#8217;t ask too many questions, but they trusted me and even let me have a smoke. I had forgotten all about cigarettes and their beautiful little high. I wasn&#8217;t addicted to them, but when I had a chance to have one I would take it. 
They dropped me off near the main city and I wandered around for the rest of the day. I pawned everything that I had stolen from my parents and ate dinner in the city. I took a bus out to the outskirts, somewhere off the highway 26 and spent the night in a ratty motel. I felt safe, thinking that no one would find me, that I had time to spare. But Amber&#8217;s words still crawled through my mind. Alfred will find you at any cost; he would see your escape as a game. He&#8217;s a sadistic man; he won&#8217;t stop at anything to win you back. 
I shivered at the thought of what he would do to me if he ever found me, would he kill me? Even worse he would take me back; I was so afraid of him; I didn&#8217;t see him the same way I saw Jasmine. She was cruel, but only when I deserved it. When we were on good terms she treated me well, when I was on good terms with Alfred he would just ignore me. I wasn&#8217;t worried too much the first time; if anything it would take time for him to find me and I knew that I was safe; for at least that night. To pass my sleepless time I watched local cable channels and ate fast food that had picked up and brought along with me. I counted my money and decided that it would definitely be enough for a couple weeks if I was going to stay at a motel, but I would have to find a job and a place to stay if this was going to go on any longer than that. I really didn&#8217;t think that far into it; all I had had in mind was that I needed to escape and like Amber said I had started some sort of game. I think in the back of my mind I knew that he would find me sooner of later and I didn&#8217;t have too worry about having money to survive. I was definitely scared of my fate, but I was reassured that I wouldn&#8217;t be alone forever. Once again, my thoughts were mixed on the subject, freedom in a hateful world, or slavery in a dream world. 
I finally fell asleep while I was tangled in my thoughts and woke up the next morning in a good lively mood. I smoked a cigarette that my neighbor offered me and took in the fresh air. 



Chapter 5



The following two weeks were typically the same. I would wake up, clean up, and pack up some things; just in case I wasn&#8217;t going to return. After this I would take the bus out to the main city and wander around through streets and shops. I didn&#8217;t have a job or anything to do, so I would just chat with strangers, who didn&#8217;t have anything to do either and some times I would eat.&nbsp; I went to the library most of the time when I didn&#8217;t have anything better to do and I would research jobs and apartments or just read. Once in a while, I would find some one on the library to talk to and I would chat with them. 
I was beginning to think that Alfred couldn&#8217;t find me, or had chosen not to look for me, or his wife had only said those things to me to scare me. But I was completely mistaken. On the fifteen day of my stay in Portland I entered the library to find one of my book friends come walking towards me.
He was a homeless man, mid thirties, who mostly stayed in the library to be warm, but would read sometimes too. He didn&#8217;t really appear to be homeless; he looked more like he was a traveler on a long journey. His face was a little scruffy and his hair was pulled back in a ponytail, he had warm clothes, a large backpack and happy eyes. In a moment, he was standing in front of me.
�Ann, I don&#8217;t know if this is helpful to you, but a man came in here yesterday, looking for you. I know you were running errands around town so you weren&#8217;t here, but he came over to the librarian right there and asked her if she knew you, and when she said she had seen you before, he asked if you were at the library,� he said.
I knew instantly that it was either Alfred or my dad.
�Did he say anything else, like if he would be back?� I asked quietly.
�Well, here&#8217;s the thing, I thought that he might be a friend of yours so I told him that you were out running errands, but you usually came to the library about this time,� he said lightly.
�Oh, Dan, I don&#8217;t want anyone looking for me. I have to leave, he might find me here,� I whined.
�I&#8217;m sorry, I was just trying to be helpful,� he said and sighed.
I gave him a hug and told him that I wasn&#8217;t blaming him and then I left.
As I walked down the streets of Portland I kept my eyes open for the two men. But I couldn&#8217;t recognize anyone. I thought about going back to my place, but I worried that I would lead him there, or that he had already found it and would be waiting for me. When evening began to roll in I decided to stop at a sandwich place, to get some soup and call it a night. As I started to open the door I felt a hand push it open for me from behind. 
A large smile grew over my face as I turned to thank the gentlemanly gesture. But as I looked back it was Alfred who was assisting me. He was right behind me, blocking my way out and I tried to keep my composer as I stepped into the shop. There were a few people sitting and eating as we entered, so I felt safe enough to know that he wouldn&#8217;t attack me here, in front of them. The cashier looked up and smiled than went back to her work. 
�Take a seat,� he gently ordered.
I could run! I could scream and run and he wouldn&#8217;t stop me, I thought. But my legs were shaking and my face was blaring with heat and I didn&#8217;t know what to do with my quaky hands. My eyes went from him to the door, to him and back to the door again.
�Are you going to sit down?� he asked quietly but firmly again.
If I ran would he follow me? I sat down at a booth near the door. He sat across from me and folded his hands on the table. He looked elegant and strong. He belonged in a city. He wore a suit and a gray woolen over coat. I wore ripped jeans and a hoddie over my prickly head. I noticed the black leather gloves on his hands and gulped.
�What can I get for you?� a waitress asked.
�I&#8217;ll have some coffee, black. What do you want Annie?� he asked, his voice was playful and kind; it was the same kind of tone he used with his family.
�I wanted some soup. Uh, do you guys have a special on those?� my voice was raspy and dry.
�We have the house special, you want to try it?� she asked.
�Yeah,� I said. 
My eyes never left his face, while he spoke to her calmly and without any doubts of suspicion from her. When she left he looked back at me and smiled.
�You didn&#8217;t even ask what was in the special,� he remarked.
�I doubt you even want coffee,� I said back.
�You&#8217;re right, I don&#8217;t drink coffee, especially not black. I&#8217;m going to kill you if you run,� he said.
The words caught me off guard. He still had the same smile on his face and he started to play with his napkin lightly.
�After we eat, you will come with me, and if you try to run away I will find you, just like I found you now and I will kill you. This is your last chance,� he whispered and laughed as if he had just told a pleasant joke.
The couple from across us looked up and smiled in approval. No doubt that this looked like a healthy dinner between a young girl and her father. He knew me, and he had a great influence over me. I wouldn&#8217;t run away, I was much too scared and numb and fading slowly back into my dreams. 
As the soup came I picked at it and watched him as he sipped his bitter coffee once in a while. He seemed relaxed and satisfied, while I was stiff. My hand could barely hold the spoon; I was shaking every time I would get some soup in it. Eventually I gave up and put the spoon down; my appetite was gone.
�Are you ready to go?� he asked.
�Yes,� I whispered. 
My eyes were starting to water, but I kept my head down to hid away from him. He paid up front and I followed him obediently as we left the store. He took my hand tightly by the wrist, just to make sure I wouldn&#8217;t try to run and waved down a cab. As we got inside he said, �Do you remember the rules?� 
I nodded, letting my tears flow freely.
�I asked you a question, speak slave,� he hissed, twisting my wrist.
�Yes master,� I cried.
The words gagged me as they came out, I wanted to throw up. I couldn&#8217;t control my breathing, I felt like I was going to faint.
�Good,� he said.
The rest of the trip was quiet. It was short and we arrived at another motel. I had expected him to take us to a nice place, but I figured that he didn&#8217;t want any attention either. He paid for the drive and pulled me out of the cab with him. I was lost to where we were at in the city now. It looked like another suburban place, but I was too scared and nervous to look around. 
As soon as he closed the door to his room he grabbed me back the neck and pushed me to the ground. I caught myself before my face hit the ground, but didn&#8217;t dare stand up. He kicked me violently in the ribs and I fell over, curling up into a ball and started crying again. It was the same snotty crying that he had seen before, with every piece of me falling apart and pouring out. 
�Please, please don&#8217;t hurt me. I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m so sorry. I&#8217;ll never disobey you again. I&#8217;m sorry,� I cryed as he circled around my crippled body.
�Take off you clothes, slave,� he said.
�You look more disgusting with them on than. Besides, I never gave you the right to wear those clothes,� he hissed.
I peeled them off my skin as I stayed grounded on the floor. He watched carefully as I slipped my bra and panties off.
�That&#8217;s it, good slave.�
It had been a while since I had been naked and disgraced in front of a person and the shame came flowing over me. I crawled onto my hands and knees and held onto his feet. I kissed them and ran my water cheeks over them.
�Please, please don&#8217;t hurt me,� I whined.
The anticipation towards his plot against me hurt more than what was actually going to happen, I was sure. But I was so alive and so scared. I wanted more than anything to go numb, but my fear was more than real. He kicked my face lightly with foot and I backed away, letting my face rest on the ground again.
�I thought that you said you remembered the rules. Obviously you haven&#8217;t learned a thing, slave. Don&#8217;t talk to me, don&#8217;t beg! Your begging will not help you; your obedience will. Do you understand?� he asked.
�Yes master,� I said, with my voice muffled against the floor.
I heard his belt clink, I knew that it came off and I started to shake.
�Suck on it, bitch,� he said.
I looked up to see his pants had come down and penis was exposed, fully erect.
�You turn me on so much when you look like that,� he said when he saw my shocked face.
I got up on my knees and started to suck. It was large, and it was the first time that I had ever given a man head. I let my tongue play with it inside my mouth and moved it in and out slowly and than more quickly, making sure that my teeth weren&#8217;t involved in any of this. He took my head in both of his hands and started to direct me, moving it back and forth the way he wanted it and he wanted it to go deeper. He pushed his cock in further, because I had merely been playing with the tip of it. I gagged and this caused him to be more aggressive with me. He pushed in even deeper and I soon learnt to relax my throat and let him pump against the back of it, instead of gagging with nervous reflexes. 
He pulled out of my mouth and stepped out of his fallen pants. He still had his shirt of as he threw me on the bed angrily and spread my legs. My face was tensely resting against the cheap motel covers as he pulled my ass up into the air and started pumping into me. I curled my arms in under my chest as he took his time to pleasure himself.&nbsp; When he was done he came easily and left me lying as he went to the bathroom. 
�Ass back in the air. Keep your face in the sheets, slave,� he ordered.
I perked my butt up in the air and felt his oozing cum run out off my ass and down my folds and leg. I heard the belt jingle again and than the first of many hits against my sore, raped ass. He beat me with no mercy, and if I cried out, it only enticed him to hurt me more. He would stop and pet my burning butt once in a while, squeezing it in his hands and adoring the pain I was in. I learned to yell into the sheets as he continued to beat me and never let down my ass until he was done.
�I&#8217;m finished,� he said.
I flopped down on the bed. The pain was gone. My face was smeared with agony.
�Off the bed, slave,� he ordered.
I crawled off the bed and onto the floor again.
�Get on your knees, face against the wall,� he ordered.
I found an open space between the blinded window and lamp stand. He tied my hands and feet behind me and let me stand on my knees against the wall plainly. As he was finishing he noticed the tiny necklace. 
�This is my wife&#8217;s. She gave it to you. Now I&#8217;ll give it back to her. This isn&#8217;t yours; this is yours,� he said this and took of the delicate necklace and put on my old training collar.
I started to cry again. He patted my head and sat down on his bed, turned on the TV and left me alone. I stood that same way for about an hour, I&#8217;d watch the clock, but it only made things worse. Finally, I gave up and fell over to my side. My knees were still bent and my face was still pressed against the wall as I fell asleep. 


Chapter 6



He woke me up early in the morning and told me to get dressed. I put on my old clothes and we left the motel room. 
In total, the drive took about four days and three nights. It could have been shorter, but we stopped and ate regularly and we rested because he was the only one driving. He gave me no reason to try to fight him because he never touched me for the rest of the trip. I felt like the worst had passed. He took me out and treated me kindly, he smiled and laughed and I talked to him when other people were around. The only times I was truly his slave was in the motel at nights. But he would let me rest on the floor and never laid a hand on me.
I watched the drive, remembering the roads in case I ever had a chance to escape again and I saw all of the exact turns as we made our way back to the house. None of these things seemed to bother him. It was either he became careless and bored, or he was convinced that I&#8217;d never have the opportunity to track my way back.
We pulled up to the front gate, were let in and then stepped out of the car, and it was driven away by a servant who met us. As we entered, he opened the drawer with his magnet cuffs inside and then paused.
�You won&#8217;t be needed those. By the time I&#8217;m done with you, you&#8217;ll never have the guts to leave this place,� he hissed.
I shuddered at his threat and followed him meekly down the hall. I knew exactly where he was taking me before we ever got there. It was the same training room I had become so familiar to. When he unlocked the door to let me inside, I was surprised to see that things had been rearranged. The bed had been moved over to the center of the room, the mattress was gone and all that remained was the metal frame that had held the mattress. Its platform was made of flat, long metal planks that had held the mattress perfectly, but wouldn&#8217;t be very comfortable for a person.
�Obviously, I was too kind with you last time we were here. This time you&#8217;re not leaving until you&#8217;ve completely under my control,� he threatened.
�Take off your clothes and lay down on the bed,� he commanded.
I chose not to argue with him and after removing my clothes, I spread out on the bed. My body was long and evenly spread out on the frame, with my back against the metal. I watched miserably as he put new cuffs onto my hands and feet. They were the same leather material as my collar. They were also thick and large, about two inches in width and definitely gave me some room to move, without giving me enough freedom. And most importantly, they were soft from the inside. He strapped them on and then adjusted the metal hoops they had hanging off of them. I watched as he opened a metal cabinet that had become a new addition to the room as well. He pulled out some silver chain strands and hooked them to the corner bars of the bed frame. He adjusted those as well and clipped the other ends to the hooks on my cuffs; basically, chaining me down to the bed in spread eagle. 
Afterwards he set a rolled up hand towel behind my head and left the room. The towel was comforting at first but it made my head tilt too far back as it pushed on the arch of my neck. I knew that the towel was balancing on one of the metal planks and I wasn&#8217;t willing to experiment, in fear of the towel rolling away and falling through the large cracks between the planks. The only differences in the room were adjustments with the bed, the cabinet and the assortment of hooks and chains hanging on the ceiling. I had seen some of those earlier, but I knew that more had been added. The chains on the wall next to me were still there. 
Thoughts about his words started to pass through my mind. I was afraid to be under his control; I had woken up from my dream world and I knew that fading away wouldn&#8217;t solve everything. It only masked my situation and it made it no better; I would become numb and stupid to logic. That&#8217;s not what he wanted; he wanted to control me and I didn&#8217;t know how to do that for him. But maybe he was right; it wasn&#8217;t my fault; he hadn&#8217;t taken the time to train me and maybe he would turn me into whatever slave he wanted in the end. I wasn&#8217;t against the idea; purely because of the fact that he would never give up chasing me and that I would never have a normal life again. If I became what he wanted me to be than I wouldn&#8217;t want to leave and everyone would be happy. But I didn&#8217;t know what to do or how I could be this person for him, and whether it would always be a battle for me to submit. 
When I thought over a larger picture of this, I realized that this whole catastrophe of things had only been going on for a few weeks; it wasn&#8217;t enough to change any human being. This was all trail and error on my part and his and that this whole idea and experiment still had time to grow and succeed.
I fell asleep and woke up a couple times. One time I woke up and observed the room closely, there was a tiny red light in one of the vents; classic, he was watching me. I smiled to myself; everything in this room would be a test to see if I was being trained properly. The rules were simply, I would have to obey.
He came in again and my eyes shot open but I didn&#8217;t look at him, I kept them focused on the ceiling. I could already feel the sweat of anxiety rolling down my temples. I heard some orchestral music turn on, primarily focus on the string instruments; it was quiet and gentle. I never listened to that music; I could care less, but I knew it was for him and that he had brought it in to help pass the time of whatever was soon to come.
�Does the good, little slave want to play today?� he asked as he unclipped the chains from the hooks on my cuffs. 
I didn&#8217;t see him do any of these things, but I could feel him work and I could hear the clanking chains over the soft music.
�I asked you a question, slave.� 
I knew what my answer was, which was no, but I also knew what he wanted to hear.
�Yes, master,� I said softly.
Once the two ankle cuffs were disconnected he took one leg and pulled it up into the air. I felt him slip a cold chain under the bend of my knee and suspend my leg in the air with the chain attaching to the ceiling. He took my ankle and hooked another chain to the loop on my ankle cuff. He did the same with the other one and left my womanhood completely exposed and legs spread wide as they suspended in the air, bent at the knee. I couldn&#8217;t manage to bring them together even if I tried because the ankles were firmly stabilized even further away from each other than the knees. 
�Breath in,� he said.
As my chest filled with air he applied nipple clamps with a chain and looped a rope through the chain and to another one handing from the ceiling. When I blew out the clips suddenly pulled tightly against my tits. But they were set up to hold and would balance out again as I would take another breath in. This little exercise made every breath I took a noticeable and painful one.
He got to work promptly after adoring his success with the nipple clamps. I felt the first light tap of a small strap against my cunt. This was the first time that he had ever hit me down there and the sting made me twitch. The slight movement created chaos with my restrains and my nipples ached again. The music continued and I followed it as he rhythmically spanked my cunt. Sometimes I would feel him spread the lips open with his fingers to get a good shot at my clit. When he did this, I would hold my breath to cease the pain in my breasts and as he would finish I would release. This helped me deal with the pain on hand instead of having both at once. 
It didn&#8217;t take long for me to finally scream out pain and defeat. I had been patient and the music never ceased so I didn&#8217;t know how much time had passed. But I kept all of the pain inside and had nothing to scream into so I just screamed at him.
�Stop it you bastard! Just stop! I can&#8217;t take anymore, I&#8217;ll just die!� I cried.
He stopped and retrieved something from his cabinet. He came over me and smiled.
�This can&#8217;t kill you; it&#8217;s only torture, it never killed anymore. You&#8217;d be surprised at how much your body can truly take. I&#8217;m not leaving any open wounds, and if there are any, their just little flesh wounds. You&#8217;re body is just whining; but I don&#8217;t want to hear you whining. Whatever you say is not going to make me stop, it might just make things worse,� he said.
Turning on a small vibrator, he grinned and stuck it in my mouth. I spit it out in refusal, but he picked it up and jammed it into my mouth at its full length. He pulled out a roll of duct tape and taped my mouth shut, rolled it around my mouth and head a couple times to secure it. Then, he tilted my head further back and taped my forehead in the titled fashion to the plank behind it, wrapping it around a couple times. 
Now I was truly scared and nervous as I stared directly at the ceiling, without being able to see his operation below. He rubbed the sides of my cunt to feel for soreness and in agony to beg for him not to continue. I felt a pinch among my folds and then another, another and one more, a pinch on my clit, more and more around my breasts and stomach. There were even more pinches on my inner thighs and above my arm pits.
The skin of my womanhood was raw and sore as he left the stinging pinchers hanging, then I heard the door close. There were several things going on at once, the music was still playing, my neck was sore and the towel felt like it was scooting away. My head was getting too much blood rushing into it and I was dizzy. The vibrator was shaking lightly inside my mouth, but my jaw was getting tired from trying to keep my teeth off of it, in fear that one of them would chip on the vibrator, since it was on.
I tried to shake some of the pinchers off by wiggling around, but that only tore at my sore suspending tits. There was simply no way out of my situation. I lay very still trying to relax and think of something else to cure my pain. But the only other thing that was stronger than my fear and physical pain was the odd sexual sensation I was receiving as I would breath in and out carefully, letting my nipples tug. The pincher on my clip also applied pressure and soon enough I was imagining the vibrator in my mouth as a man&#8217;s dick pulsing inside of me. 
It wasn&#8217;t long before he reappeared and seemed satisfied when I opened my eyes and looked at him watching over me.
�I think you&#8217;re starting to like this, my little cunt,� he teased.
I growled in defiance. He twisted one of my pinchers in reply to the growl. 
�Is this what you want?� he asked.
I felt him pull the pincher off my clip and start to rub it with his moistened finger. It wasn&#8217;t just the physical act, I reacted to the situation. I was completely in his power, bound and helpless and he, this man that had the power to murder me, was playing with my little pea sized clit. Waves of passion ran through me and I curled my lips around the vibrator, pretending it was his cock. 
He stopped and twisted some of the pinchers on my cunt. My fantasy disappeared and I started to squirm from the pain again. It was worse than the lashing, my skin was already sore and swollen and now he was just focusing on hurting small little areas. I tried to move me head, but I had forgotten that it was tapped down.
�This isn&#8217;t supposed to be enjoyable; this is your punishment. Cry all you want. You&#8217;ll learn soon that this is what happens to bad slaves if they try to run away,� he said.
He pulled off the clips violently, leaving a long stink from every one of them as they snapped off my skin. He lashed my sore cunt a couple more times and then applied one pincher on my clit, letting it sit there lonely. Lastly, he pulled the tape off my head and mouth and pulled out the vibrator. 
I watched as he unclipped the nipple clamps and put them away with everything else, leaving me abandoned in my awkward position. 
Someone came in a while later and gave me water to drink. I didn&#8217;t look at who it was and I didn&#8217;t try to talk to them. I knew he was watching and I didn&#8217;t want to fail one of his tests or get anyone else involved in my problems. I did wonder about how ridiculous I must have looked to whoever was attending me. They stayed in the room for a while; I could hear them walking around and picking up things; washing things in the sink. Soon enough, they were gone and I was alone again. I stopped thinking about my bondage as punishment, the only time I was truly embarrassed by was if anyone saw me encased in it outside of my master and mistress. I was actually starting to enjoy the feeling of being powerless; it mad me put my trust into someone else for once.
I fell asleep and woke up a couple more times before he reentered. He also gave me something to drink and then got to work. I wish I could have asked him how long it had been and when he would let me out, but I knew I couldn&#8217;t talk to him and I feared for the worst. He pulled the clip off my clit and it stung; it stung even worse when he touched it and I flinched. I chose not to watch him operate. In a minute I felt a warm sensation against my clit, but it went too quickly from warm to hot and then I felt a burning liquid run down my clit, only to cool in an instant. My skin was already sore and swollen and I could barely keep myself from whining again, so I looked up to see what he was doing to be, just in case it was worth screaming about. 
He was holding a long, dripping candle over my clit, letting the boiling wax drop onto it; I let my head fall again. This couldn&#8217;t hurt me. But the burn was raw and powerful, and although I couldn&#8217;t see him causing the pain, that&#8217;s my entire mind could concentrate on. I felt myself thinking deeper and deeper into it; the hot and then the warm and cool that proceeded; running over my tortured clit. In a way, I could learn to like it if I was really turned on previously, but I wasn&#8217;t. He hadn&#8217;t done anything to make this sexual. It was pure torture against the most sensitive part of my body. 
Noticing that I was refusing to scream, he got up and stood over me, letting the wax drop onto my belly and breasts. He let the fire sit closely above my swollen, bruised nipples and the wax would run and hit the skin of my breasts. It was painful, but some how exhilarating. He touched my lips with his free hand; I stared at him and then at the fire, finally closing my eyes and letting him caress my face. 
When he was finished with his wax game, he simply left again, leaving me the same way I had become so adjusted to. Someone came in some time after and wiped the wax off on skin. They let down my legs and buckled them to the ends of the bed again. It felt good to have them down, I was starting to worry that I&#8217;d lose them from lose of blood circulation. I never opened my eyes or faced the person who was taking care of me, I knew it wasn&#8217;t my master, by the way the walked and how they would breathe, but I didn&#8217;t want to face them because I was embarrassed and I didn&#8217;t want the sympathy that they would try to give me with their eyes. 
Silence, loneliness, and unwelcome thoughts; that was all I felt as I would lay and wait for his next visit. I wet myself; completely aware that no one would release me to use the bathroom. I just let it run to the floor. How many days had it been? The lack of reference to time killed me more and more inside. I felt like it had been a long time since he had visited me last. I didn&#8217;t want him to visit because he would torture me, but at the same time I knew that the more he visited, the sooner my punishment would be over and the sooner I would be let out of my little hell.
I regretted abusing my freedom when I had had it last. I should have listened to Amber and stayed with her; they had let me have my life, as free as someone like I could get and I ran, more than once. I deserved this punishment; it was my fault and no one else&#8217;s. The doctor was right when he said that I would live a life of bondage. There was no escape from this place, I would have to break and I was breaking.
My head was faint, I was tired and sore and depressed, when he came back in again. Once again I was offered only water; and I drank as much as I could possibly get because my hunger engrossed my thirst. 
�You&#8217;ve been learning lessons of patience and perseverance. I&#8217;ve deprived you of anything humanly possible, except for the water you need to live. Today will be your last lesson, the lesson of dependability. You have been in here for about three days, two nights and I&#8217;m to keep you here one more night. Once you are free, you will be able to do what you please around the house, but you will have to use your mind and make good decisions during your stay. The rules have been changed a little; no one is going to touch you or bother you unless you are conceptual, except for your master (points to himself) and your mistress Jasmine. Your masters have to be conceptual to your sexual actions with other as well. You will act like our slave in our presence, but you will be an upper class resident of this building other wise. Jasmine and I talked this over and decided that you will never have a happy life if your treatment like this continued. But beware how you are around the two of us, or you will suffer,� he warned.
�So, dependability; you already depend on me, whether you want to come to terms on this or not. I give you food and drink and shelter. But now you will also depend on me for sexual release as well. Unless I or Jasmine approve, you will not be touched or pleasured by anyone except for us. This means that you will have to play our little games and give us what we want to have, in return for your pleasure. You might be thinking to yourself, &#8216;I don&#8217;t need sexual release.� But if you think that, you are strongly mistaken. The longer you&#8217;ve spent here, the more sexually exposed you have become and soon you will beg for it,� he said.
He stood over me and caressed my nipple. Warm sensation ran through my body. I wouldn&#8217;t argue with him; it was true, I even enjoyed his torture half the time, in need of another orgasm.
�Does that feel good, slave?� he asked.
�Yes, master,� I whispered.
�Do you want me to pleasure you?� he asked, continuing to caress me.
He couldn&#8217;t possibly know how good that felt; how could such a little motion with his fingers set off so many feelings? He ran his fingers over my belly and circled over my little belly button. Shivers crawled across my skin. Those same fingers found their way down to my sensitive clit and started to rub slowly. They picked up some of the juices flowing from my hole and rubbed them onto my clit.
�Tell me, and be honest, when you are just about to orgasm,� he ordered. 
I waited patiently as he continued to work on it, he using both hands; some fingers sliding in and out of hole, while others rubbed my clit. My started to clench up and my toes curl in; I could feel my legs starting to shake lightly; involuntarily from the pulses of pleasure running through me. He stopped.
�Are you there yet?� he asked.
�No, master,� I sighed.
�Do you want me to continue?� he asked, starting to rub my clit very slowly and teasingly.
�Yes, master,� I said.
�Beg,� he hissed.
�Please master, make me cum. Make you poor slave cum,� I whined.
�You&#8217;re not a slave, you&#8217;re a cunt slut; say it,� he barked.
�Make the cunt slut cum, please,� I cried.
He started to play with me again. The pause in between left my sex in suspense and as he started and my cunt muscles curled up, the sensations were undeniable, I could feel the small sparks of an orgasm coming up, and as I took the last breath in and focused on the heat in my womanhood, I stopped and said, �I&#8217;m really about to cum!�
He stopped immediately. My shaking legs released and dropped. I tried to play tricks on my brain and finish the orgasm, but it needed substance and pressure. So the feelings suddenly disappeared and I was let down. What would be worse; having the orgasm and getting in trouble for it or stopping right before and it being a huge tease leading up to nothing. My fury for un-satisfaction was at an all time high. There was nothing worse than not getting your way and finishing.
�Do you want to finish?� he asked as he came up to my face and kissed my neck.
�Yes, please master, let the cunt slut finish,� I begged.
�Would you do anything to finish?� he asked.
�Anything!�
�Suck my cock, let me finish and I&#8217;ll let you finish,� he offered.
I nodded and he got on the bed and straddled me. He pulled down his pants and stuck his hard dick in my mouth before I could think things over. I let it ram hard into the back of my throat; I was determined to please him so that he could let me have what I wanted. I slid in and out, going deeper and deeper; every time I would open my eyes barely, he would be watching my worn out face with an evil smile. I did my best to please him and as he was about to finish he pulled out and ran his cum over my face and neck; I felt dirty, I felt like an object; marked his property by his cum. 
�Your turn,� he said as he hopped off.
�Once again, tell me when you are about to cum, slave,� he said.
I could lie. I could tell him that I was about to cum once I had already done so. Would he know? Oh coarse he would! He could see everything; I was more afraid of his punishment rather than the lack of pleasure. This was the final test of endurance.He started rubbing again and my mind went wild. I started arguing with myself again; maybe he wouldn&#8217;t notice, maybe he would. It wasn&#8217;t long before I found myself at the same place as before; my muscles tense and ready, my heart racing.
�I&#8217;m ready,� I said.
He stopped; I knew he would. I knew that he was teasing me and that I wouldn&#8217;t get anything out of this. He pulled out a flogger from the cabinet and lashed it lightly against my stomach and thighs to help me concentrate on the pain instead of the pleasure I couldn&#8217;t receive. After several soft blows, he stopped, put in away and came back over to my clit.
�Please, please master,� I whined.
If he touched me one more time, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to hold back. He pulled the fold out of the way with his fingers, leaned his face over it and blew softly on it.&nbsp; I shook with anticipation; I was going to explode; if he could just touch me one more time! He stopped unhooked the chains from my wrists and ankles.
�I&#8217;m going to leave you at your ease. If you haven&#8217;t noticed that camera yet it&#8217;s been watching you and it&#8217;s going to continue throughout this evening. If you touch yourself even once down there, or dare to pleasure yourself, I swear that your punishment will be worse than anything you have yet experienced. Don&#8217;t take off the cuffs on your wrists and ankles. They will be required attire with that collar of yours. Good night,� he said strictly and left.



Chapter 7




 I sat up and the blood rushed to my head, everything spun and I took a minute to recollect myself. I was still thirty so the first thing I did was walk over to the sink and drink all the water I pleased. The cuffs seemed fitting and I felt comfortable and happy wearing them, I didn&#8217;t mind. There was nothing to do so I grabbed the towel from the bed, found a good corner of the room and tried to fall asleep. It was no good, my pussy was aching; it was literally throbbing and had a little twitch coming and going to remind me that it was still waiting for me. I thought about the camera, but I also thought about the cabinet with the play toys in it. If I was going to break his rules I would have to make it worth it. At least three or four or even five orgasms to make up for the shit he was putting me through.
No, I wouldn&#8217;t do it. I though about being free to go about the house as I pleased. I almost forgot about Jasmine, but then I remember my sudden infatuation with her, I missed her and I wanted to see her and please her. I fell asleep, dreaming about her strong beautiful body. Once in a while, I would wake up with anxiety, but he hadn&#8217;t come back yet I would make myself go back to sleep because I didn&#8217;t have the patience of waiting for him while I was awake.
Finally he came.
�Oh, you&#8217;ve been such a good girl; now you&#8217;ve earned your reward. Get on your hands and knees,� he ordered.
I did exactly what he said and positioned myself. I heard him pull down his pants and then he kneeled over me. He wrapped his hand around my neck and pushed my chin up high. I felt the tips of his fingers caress my neck.
�Oh, you&#8217;re such a good slave,� he said and slipped his cock in gently.
It moved in and out slowly and he reached under and caressed my clit while he pumped, until I had my orgasm. I let my head fall to the ground in pleasure and released the weight off my arms. He grabbed my hips and started pumping hard, serving himself, now that I had finally gotten my long awaited orgasm. It was incredible.
When he was finished he pulled out and spewed his cum on my back.
�Let&#8217;s go,� he ordered.
I stood up and followed him to the cabinet. He opened a drawer full of ropes and chains and pulled out a short chain, which he attacked each end to my wristlets. Then he took another one, about the same length, and attacked one end to the first chain and one to my collar. It gave the appearance and feel of a person who couldn&#8217;t let down their arms completely, so they bended at the elbow and my hands hung suspended at rib level. They chain pulled heavily on my neck if I ever let my hands dangle. He attacked another long chain to my collar and led me out of the room. 
Like always, I let my eyes drop to the ground to avoid anyone&#8217;s eyes. We made it to the dinning hall just in time for breakfast. I was seated on the ground in my regular spot and no one really paid attention to me. Alfred seemed satisfied with things finally being back to their old order. His wife tossed me a couple dirty glances of distrust, but nothing more than that. Jasmine and Abigail never looked at me. And Matthew was gone. I wasn&#8217;t allowed anything except some clear soup due to the lack of food and how my stomach would react. So I was still hungry after breakfast was over. 
He took me upstairs and to the third floor. One the way to his room, we stopped at one of the smaller, unnoticeable rooms, he led me inside. It was small, with one window over looking the left side of the estate. There was a bed, night stand, dresser, a bathroom and an empty closet and dresser, was a large, wide mirror and in front of it there chains hanging from the ceiling. I was surprised; it would have been strange to have a normal room. All of the furniture and bedding was black, but it contrasted greatly with the white walls and white carpeted floor. I didn&#8217;t match the elegant style of the rest of the house; it obviously wasn&#8217;t for show and just happened to be Alfred&#8217;s handy work and came completely out of his imagination.
�This is yours,� he said.
�Thank you master,� I said.
Although it wasn&#8217;t all that great; it was more than I could ask for, it was my own place and I finally had a bed! He left me by myself and I shower and shaved for the first time, in a long time. I took the chains and cuffs of deliberately; I even took off my collar and stared at my pure, naked body. There was a clink at the door and I quickly but my collar back on. As I was adjusting one of my wristlets Jasmine came into the bathroom. She looked as beautiful as always, but seemed more stern and hurt.
�You betray your mistress! You are a bratty slave aren&#8217;t you?� she hissed.
I looked up at her and tried to look as miserable as ever; I couldn&#8217;t possibly take any more torture or punishment.
�Come over here,� she said and waved her hand.
I came close and she hugged me. As she held me close she asked, �Do you absolutely hate me that you have to constantly be running away?�
�No mistress,� I said quietly, burring my face him her soft skin.
�Speak slave,� she ordered.
�I&#8217;m completely infatuated with you. I&#8217;m sorry, it was only natural for me to run away, I am a slave aren&#8217;t I? Every caged creature wants to escape, no matter how wonderful the cage might be,� I explained.
�You won&#8217;t run away again will you?� 
�No,� I promised.
�Now come over here and pleasure me slave,� she insisted.
We went over to the bed and I spent the afternoon making her cum over and over again. I never got tired and every time would orgasm it would encourage me to make her cum again. U wanted her to love me the way that I loved her. I adored the way she moaned and how captivated she was by me when I pleasured her. I wasn&#8217;t the slave anymore, I wasn&#8217;t the captive; she was under my captivity. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was finally too tired to continue and her clit too sore. She held me in her arms and we had an afternoon nap together. We had food brought up to us and ate in my room as well.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Where is Matthew; I didn&#8217;t think anyone was allowed off the premises,� I asked finally.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I expected the answer to be plain and was just asking it to fill in the quiet that was caused by out mouths being full.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well, in the series of well you were absent we had a couple battles. He didn&#8217;t make it last time he fought,� she said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She hung her head and we sat staring out the small window.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How is Abigail taking it?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why should it matter to you? What do you know about them?� she asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I over heard them talking. They were lovers; weren&#8217;t they? 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, they were more in love than anyone else out here. She&#8217;s devastated; she keeps saying that she would rather have died than let him. But all know that she has never enjoyed her life and expects to die at any fight. Of course, I&#8217;m trying to be supportive to her; I let her spend every night in my room. But it feels like she has become more attached to me in these past couple of days than ever before. Maybe she is grieving or transferring her love from Matthew onto me. I cannot return her love, I do not love her the way she loves me. I am there for her and I let her have her way, but I&#8217;m not attached to her,� she said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I sat in silence and let her speak, absorbing all of the information.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; �Do you love anyone?� I asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No. In my past life I had a man, the man of my dreams but we fought and we were both strong, I ran from him and then I was taken against my will to become an animal, a savage. I would still go back to him in the way that I am now, but I am not free. The last time we spoke he was so angry and I left him with the bitterest words from my mouth,� she said, gazing and remembering.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What about Alfred?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�He is too strong as well. We would never get along if we spent more time together. I am content the way that life is. I like making Alfred and Abigail happy when they call on me and you give me pleasure when I call on you. I want you to stay; I don&#8217;t want you to try to run away. I know that Alfred has threatened you; I can only imagine what he has done to you. But I wanted you to stay because you care about me, rather than the fear of him,� she begged.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I will stay for you!� I smiled.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She seemed satisfied and got up.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m leaving now, but I&#8217;ll be back soon. I&#8217;m going to be fighting tomorrow,� she said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good luck,� I said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;ll see you before then,� she said and left.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wandered around the room and found that the bottom drawer of my empty dresser had play toys in it. I put the chains I was wearing earlier in there and pulled out a vibrator. I spent the rest of the evening playing with myself. I had dinner and dozed off to sleep early.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I felt fingers tips brushing against my cheek and opened my eyes suddenly. Alfred was sitting on my bed and smiled as I woke up. In an instant I didn&#8217;t know what to do. Should I continue to lay, so jump to my knees, and bow down? My face went pale; I could feel the blood washing out of me.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Stand up slave,� he said, his voice was calm.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As I stood up he led me over to stand in front of the mirror. He hooked a chain to on of my cuffs and threw it over the chain looped off the ceiling. He then attached the other end to my other cuff and I stood with my hand tied over my head, handing from the ceiling. He then strapped a long metal leg spreader to my anklets and left my legs gaped at least three or four feet. He came over and ran his hands over my tied naked body.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Look at yourself, slave,� he ordered.
I stared at my self in the mirror. My skin was pale, but still glowed lightly from the anxiety I was experiencing. My body was long and thin and my breasts looked bigger compared to my small body. The chains, stretching my hands to the ceiling and the bar gaping my legs aroused me. I had become so used to the bondage, it meant that I was going to receive attention, whether good or bad and it usually meant sex. Besides, my body looked beautiful and mature against the restrains; my tummy tucked in and my arms pulling on my long torso and pushing out my breasts. 
�What do you think? You may speak.�
�Beautiful,� I admitted.
He pulled out a whip and lashed it against the skin of my back. I yelped. My ribs expanded, my breasts giggled and my legs shook. It was gorgeous. Immediately my snatch started to throb. I was entranced by myself. As he beat me I wanted my glorious red face and light skin twitch and move. He curved the wipe and it wrapped in between my legs, slicing my folded. I whined and wiggled as he continued.&nbsp; He stopped and waved his strong hand around my neck, standing behind me, we both looked in the mirror. He dropped the whip and started kneading my breast as he locked his hand over my neck, cutting off my air supply. I grasped for air but he held me close, kissing and licking my innocent ear. 
�Are you afraid of me,� he whispered.
I nodded my head.
�Will you ever try to run away again?� he asked.
I shook my head; no.
He let go of my and I breathed. He reached in and started fingering me from behind and he continued to knead my breast.
�I&#8217;m taking you out tomorrow to see Jasmine fight. Will you behave or do I have to leave you her and keep you tied up so you don&#8217;t try to run while I&#8217;m gone?� he asked.
�I&#8217;ll be good, master,� I said.
My eyes were closed as he hypnotized me with his hands. He stopped and untied me, laying me down on the bed softly.
�Good,� he said and left.


Chapter 8

I was calm and happy and the next day came and went. Evening appeared sooner than expected. I had stayed in my room and no one had bothered me. As the sun set a servant came in, I recognized her. I was the same girl that had kissed me while I was still in my prison downstairs and had helped me get ready for my first introduction to the house. She smiled, but didn&#8217;t say anything; put down all of the things in her arms and left. I came over and found a black dress, shawl, shoes, accessories, and makeup. I got to work and soon I was dressed to go to the fight. I took off all the cuffs and collar, expecting that I had an excuse not to wear them to the outing. 
Once I was downstairs I was met by another servant and led over to a waiting room near the door where everyone was gathering.
�Over here slave,� my master ordered.
I came over to him and stood by his side while my eyes were cast to the ground.
�You look perfect,� he approved.
We were soon all gathered, except for the Mrs. and left the house. We arrived to another large building about a half and hour later. The driver provided some sort of access code at the gate and we were let in. Our car got to the front of the building and we were escorted inside by one of the servants at the door. It was completely empty inside the huge building with high ceilings. There was furniture and d�cor of coarse, but no one except for a few servants. We were led around the side, down some stairs. Once again an access code was provided and we went past a door and down more stairs. I could here voices now and as we turned the corner there were people everywhere. It was a large room, somewhere belowground with concrete walls. There were arched bleachers around a center stage that was about three feet off the ground. Around it was a large square net and there was people, turned to animals, fighting inside.
Everyone was dressed up elegantly, but it didn&#8217;t fit the atmosphere at all. About a hundred, well dressed people were seated and walking around a place that looked like an underground night club. The lights were dimed, but there was a huge beam over the cage. The cage and bleachers were the only substance of furniture, outside of the two bars and many waiters on either side of the room. We were handed drinks off a tray passing by and as Alfred was about to go sit down, I was grabbed by Jasmine. He waved us a goodbye and decided to talk to one of his friends instead. 
They led me to a back door and we went inside. It was a bare room, with a couple of people taking or putting on clothes. There also a couple mirror, chairs and a bed with blood stains on it. Jasmine left immediately to change out of her clothes while Abigail grabbed me by the arm and led me to a corner of the room where Jasmine couldn&#8217;t hear.
�Tonight is a different type of fight for Jasmine. Alfred has agreed to battle with one of his old rivals over a creature. It is not a fight to the death or until on of them is dead. It is a fight to get rights. The loser has to leave with the winner&#8217;s master. Do you understand?� she asked.
�I think so,� I said.
�Well, here is the truth. If Jasmine loses, she&#8217;ll be gone forever. I know she is strong and maybe she would win, but the chance of her losing is still strong. If she leaves I will never be able to live with myself; I have lost too much. She won&#8217;t be dead; she&#8217;ll be someone else&#8217;s animal. She lives a life of luxury now, but who knows how she will be treated than. And worst than that, what if she is faced up to fight me to the death after she his taken away and trained by her new master? What misery,� she complained.
�Now, Anna, this decision was made by Alfred and I. Jasmine is not aware, because she is too prideful to back down from a fight and she would never let someone step in for her. But you are just a slave and it would be so much better for you to fight and lose than for her. The whole household loves her and it would be tragic to lose her. What difference would it make if you had another master? They would all treat you the same,� she said.
�So let me get this straight; you want me to fight?� I said.
�Yes, yes. But don&#8217;t look at it in a bad way; try your best, maybe you&#8217;ll be lucky and win and we will have a new creature at the house,� she said and started to caress my arm.
�But I&#8217;ve never fought a battle in my life,� I murmured.
�Instincts my darling,� she said.
�I suppose it would be the right thing to do, Jasmine does not deserve to become a captive to another,� I said.
�Yes, you&#8217;re right. So here&#8217;s the plan; when Jasmine has to fight I&#8217;m going to divert her and she will come in late when she comes back to fight. By than you would have already taken her place,� she said.
�When is the fight?� I asked.
�Right about now,� she said and smiled.
She ran over to Jasmine, who had undressed and was meditating and disrupted her. She said something to her and the girls eyes shot open. She put on her clothes as quickly as she could and they ran out of the room. I stood and thought about everything that had happened. All the sighs pointed to her reasoning. Why would Alfred take me to a fight when he had never before? Why would he let me go with the girls and not bother to look into that and worry? He already knew the plan; the only oblivious person was Jasmine. She thought that she was still fighting, but it wouldn&#8217;t be fair for her if she lost. She wouldn&#8217;t be able to recuperate; she would be someone else&#8217;s. I couldn&#8217;t let that happen, I wanted the best for her. What would be left at the house to give me pleasure if her beautiful face was gone?
I pulled off my clothes and jewelry and followed a woman who came in and asked if I was ready, seeing that I was the only person there at the moment. I followed her and everything started to slow down around me. The lights were so dark and the voices so loud as we walked towards the cage; my felt numb against the concrete ground. I heard someone laughing, but my eyes were looking far away. I wanted to fly away, but my body felt like the concrete that I was walking on. 
She unlocked and open the cage door, inside stood another naked woman ready to fight me. I looked at her and recognized her immediately. It was Red; the same girl that had sat in the cage next to me as we left the clinic to our new homes. And I suddenly and strongly remember the words she had told me. You have to be willing to kill or you will be killed. I hope we never meet again, because if we do we will most likely have to fight to the death, I&#8217;m going to be a warrior. If I have to die it better be one hell of a fight.
I shivered and looked at her cold face. Behind her glare she was sad and scared and sorry for what she was about to do to me. All of the voices had faded away; it was only us in the bright light. A bell rang and she turned into her monstrous self. I gave way to fear and my body soon became one too. I listened for her heart beat and I caught it. As I did we both dashed for each other&#8217;s throat. She grabbed my first, but I bit her arm and tore her skin off, I ran my fingers across her face and she lash back by pulling away and throwing me against the ground. I couldn&#8217;t feel pain anymore due to all of the adrenaline. She jumped on me and tried to get at my face. She managed to kick me, but I pushed her off with my feet and threw her on her back. Again my feet ripped at her flesh; her heart beat faster and faster. 
A wave of fury came over me, but it wasn&#8217;t my fury. Her eyes narrowed in and her face grew red with anger, she blasted me away from her with all of the strength in her arms and legs and I flew against the corner of the cage. I tried to get back on my feet but she was too quick and on top of me again. I claws ripped had her hands as she tried to finish me off. But she was fast and she had my hands pinned down in no time. A smile grew over her bloody face as she leaned in to finish me off. I could feel the deep bit in my neck and then I heard another bell go off. She looked confused because the fight wasn&#8217;t over, but she turned back into a person and sat down next to me. 
I felt my body turning back too and as I put my hands on my neck I only felt a little bit.
�I hope you hated your last master because you&#8217;re coming to live with us. Although our master isn&#8217;t all that great either,� she sighed.
Little spurts of blood ran down her body; I had barely done any damage compared to how bad it looked when she was an animal. We were escorted out of the cage and I was handcuffed immediately. Red left freely to clean up and change back. They stood me in front of all the people, while I was still naked and bloody.
�This is now property of Emanuel D. Dickson,� was announced overhead and applause broke out.
 I felt two hands on either side of me and I was escorted to meet my new master. I took one quick look at him as we walked to him and his company. He looked to be in his late forties, brown hair was gray streaks, some young winkles, but a smooth face over all with a hefty beard. He looked to weigh a little over two hundred pound and looked fat compared to his stature of barely six feet. But he wore a nice suit and scarf which made him look presentable and rich.&nbsp; Next to him was a woman who was also large and short, about 180 pounds and 5&#8217;6 at the most, she had red chubby cheeks and fluffy short hair. But her dress was well mannered as well and she had her nose in the air. I also briefly noticed two men of young age, who were strong and handsome looking, standing directly behind the two. 
�On your knees, face to the ground slave! There will be plenty of training to be had with you. What right do you have staring at your master like that?� he hissed. 
He had whiny voice.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Stop sir!� It was the familiar voice of my former master.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�There has been a mistake! Jasmine, my other creature was supposed to fight. This girl hasn&#8217;t fought a day in her life! She was only my pet, a little slave, so was manipulated and tricked into fighting by this wicked thing,� he said and I heard Abigail start to cry.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Lies! What kind of a man would keep an animal so violent and wicked like this thing as pet? You just want a rematch!� he yelped.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No rematch, take the traitor, she&#8217;s yours, just give me back my pet; it was not a fair fight, she has never fought before,� he begged.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What&#8217;s so important about her? If she is just a pet than you should not be so attached,� he argued.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Will you take one of my others in trade for her?� he sounded defeated.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No! Obviously she is good for something if you are willing to sacrifice your best fighters for her. I will take her. Tell me sir, or I will just have to find out for myself; why do you want her so badly?� he asked curiously.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�She has given me great pleasure; she&#8217;s my lover,� he said painfully.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ah, a lover; well, sir I&#8217;ll take pity on you and promise to take care of her. Since she has never fought and has not been trained to do so, than I will never have her fight either. She will do what she is trained to do; she will be my great lover,� he teased.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There were no other words said and I heard their footsteps leave, walk away forever.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you going to be a good slave to your new master?� he hissed as he kicked me lightly in the ribs.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, master,� I said, let my lips kiss the concrete as I spoke.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Will you be a good lover to me like you were to your old master? The same master that let you slip out of his hands so easily?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes master,� I said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good. Get up, we are leaving, we have no business left here.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Again, I was back to square one; a new master, a new trainer; more torture, except from a man who was appalling in looks and taste. As we exited the building a mast was put over my face to keep me from finding out the where about of where we were going. A chain was put around my neck and I was led and directed by it. They put me inside of a car and I felt no one near, but could hear other voices in the car, my new master and a woman.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What will you do with that creature,� she said, as if I couldn&#8217;t hear her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What I said I would do,� he returned.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Turn her into a love slave or something of that sort! Why in good heavens would you do that? You already have half the house as your mistress,� she said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why not have another!� he yelped.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I do not satisfy you in any way do I? You hate me! You are purely doing this to anger me; to spit my! Why can&#8217;t she just be that monster I saw inside of the cage?� she whined.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Does she look like one? Does she act like it? Obviously she has been trained otherwise. She fought so badly I was surprised that he would have chosen such a player,� he complained.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�If she was so bad, why didn&#8217;t you just take one of the girls he was offering up?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�She meant more to him that any of those girls and I would rather take that way as my victory prize than some creature he could care less about!�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Your pride is disgusting; it will kill you one day!�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I pressed my head against the window and listened to the rain outside instead of their endless arguments. I was led out of the car when it stopped and walked into the house, where my naked, bloody body was then rinsed off. They only took the mask off once as they showered me and they applied it again as I was walked through the building, outside again and into another building, then up a flight of stairs and into a room. It was warm, but silent as they lay me down on the bed and left.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The door opened and I heard footsteps. Someone&#8217;s clothes were taken off and then I felt my body tilt towards the new weight on the bed. Two fingers pinched my nipple. They were a man&#8217;s hands; no doubt it was my new master. The mask on me; covered my eyes and head but kept my mouth exposed.&nbsp; He ran his fingers against my lips. I felt the urge to fight him, but my hands were still cuffed behind my back, they had been cuffed this whole time. I didn&#8217;t react and he lay me on my back, because I had been lying on my side. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you want to please your new master?� he whispered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I nodded my head; yes. I didn&#8217;t want to make him angry with me on the first night.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I felt him move his fingers down towards the folds of my sex.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m going to keep that mask on you until tomorrow. Do you know why? Because I don&#8217;t want to look at a whore that I don&#8217;t own and I don&#8217;t want you to look at me before I had made you mine. But I will use you tonight as an object, you cannot see me and I cannot see your eyes, so you body is plainly a body, without a soul. Once you are mine, and your soul is mine than I will keep your face exposed,� he explained as he caressed my clit.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I hated him and his whiny voice, but his hands were magic as they play with my clit. I enjoyed the thought of being an object; it felt better than having to justify myself as a captive slave.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He stopped touching my clit and scooped up some of my flowing juices with his finger. He placed that finger against my lips and ran it over them. I kissed his finger and then slurped it into my mouth, sucking on it as if I were sucking on his dick. I heard him groan and then he pulled it out and I felt his real penis enter. It was huge and I could barely get three inches down voluntarily. He wasn&#8217;t satisfied and pushed down deeper. It slipped into my throat as I opened up and bobbed my head, allowing it to go deeper and deeper. With whatever room I had to move I worked my tongue around it. He was pinching my tits all the while, preparing myself and him for the real sex. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He pulled out and moved back a little. Grabbing my small ankles, he pushed them into the air and spread my legs wide. I felt his huge dick ram into and the pure pleasure swept over me. I imagined that I was making love to my old master because I could not see the face or body of the new one; I was glad. He turned me over and pierced my ass with his cock; I hadn&#8217;t expected it, so I didn&#8217;t hurt as much as it would have if I knew it was coming. He got me on my knees and held me by the throat as he continued to fuck me. Finally, I found myself on top of him, riding him backwards. He took so long to cum that I built up my own orgasm while I rode him and we came at the very same time!
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As I rolled off of him I thought about everything; maybe this wouldn&#8217;t be so bad. His great sex would make up for his horrid looks and bad temper. He wouldn&#8217;t torture me for pleasure would he? He didn&#8217;t know that&#8217;s what my old master did, so he probably didn&#8217;t expect that that was what brought him pleasure. I laughed to myself in joy. But as I continued to think, I realized that I hadn&#8217;t hated the torture; that it was bad a first but I started seeing it as attention towards me. It felt like it had been missing here, like I expecting him to spank me, but he never did. What did that mean?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I heard as he fell asleep and tried to pull the mast off of me, it was on there for good, and I thought that I could try to run now, but I thought better not to because I would make too much noise running into things and wake him up. I fell asleep as well, hoping for a better tomorrow. I didn&#8217;t know how late it was when I was finally woken up. He told me to stand up and led me by the chain again. We walked through a couple doors and he sat me down on a cold chair. He undid my hand cuffs and tied my wrists to the arms of the chair instead. He also tied my ankles.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�This could easily be done by somebody else, but I really enjoy doing it myself. This is going to hurt, little slave,� he said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a long silence, I heard him pacing and then all of a sudden there was a sharp burn against the shoulder of my back. I cried out in pain and then it was gone; leaving a looming, desolate pain. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Now you&#8217;re truly my properly. But I&#8217;m not done with you yet. I&#8217;m going to add a little more decoration. You&#8217;re a little sex slave and you won&#8217;t mind if I give you a couple piercings; there&#8217;s no worry of them getting torn off, if you&#8217;re not going to fight,� he said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I gulped.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I felt a cold tip against one of my breasts, he was marking the spots, and he did the same to the other.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Try to stay still; or we&#8217;ll have to re-pierce,� he threatened.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I body froze. The needle slid through painfully and I had to clench my teeth to stop from screaming. I could feel sweat and tears collecting under my mask. My hands were shaking and sweating as he pierced the other one. He had put in rings and pulled on them lightly to make sure that I was aware they were rings too.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He unlocked the mask and peeled it off. I didn&#8217;t dare look at him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�There&#8217;s only one thing missing? What could better say that you&#8217;re my little cattle than a septum piercing? Like a little cow, that I won!� he laughed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tilting my chin up, he marked the shot where we would pierce on either side of the inside of my nose and I shut my eyes as he clamped the septum with one of his tools. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Breath in little slave,� he said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Breath out.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As I did he pushed the thick needle through and pushed a large hoop in through my nose. He dabbed the little blood and pulled on it lightly with his finger as I opened my eyes.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you want to see yourself?� he asked as he untied me.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We were in a small bathroom that looked more like a doctor&#8217;s room at a clinic. The sink and its surrounding area were dedicated to clean piercing tools and sanitary supplies. There were drawers above sink, a toilet and a long, white table where the shower would have been if there was one. I was seated in a chair near the sink and there was a small metal prod with a brand on it and a single portable heating coil plugged the wall.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Come look at yourself in the mirror,� he begged.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a mirror in one of the drawer as he opened it and he held it for me as I looked at my face and breasts. The ring in my nose was the a little smaller than a quarter, but it still looked big compared to my face. The nipple rings were smaller, nickel sized, but definitely thicker. He had spared the pain it caused me to have a bigger gage.&nbsp; He turned the mirror to my back and as I looked in it I saw the brand on my shoulder blade that read ED.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mine! You&#8217;re all mine now!� he said smiling.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sick bastard! Why was it necessary to brand anyone?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He led me out of the bathroom and through out hall with doors on their side.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�TV room, library, sauna, kitchen, private hall, another bathroom, my office, and here we are at my room,� he said,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had been pointed at closed doors as we walked down the hall and opened up to large room. It had painted ceilings and columns. His bed was played on top of a stage with three steps leading up to it and it sat at the far corner of the room. There were decorous things around the room like statues and curtains and flowers. There were a couple stands and a main dinning table in the middle of room. It was also decorated and accessories and ready for use at anytime.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�These are my rooms; we are located at the west wing of the house and my wife lives in her wing on the left. She hosts parties downstairs, but I could care less. I spend almost all of my time up here. Unless I have to make an outing, this is my favorite place. You&#8217;ll be staying here and serving me and any of the company I might have. I&#8217;m having a cage brought in here for you; you&#8217;ll be my little pet too,� he smiled.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Breakfast is about to be served and I want you to serve it. We don&#8217;t generally use the kitchen, so the food is brought up here. You only have to take it out of the cart and serve it up to us. In us I mean, that I usually have two of my creatures named Dart and Cam, come up here and eat with me. I am a rich man so I can afford to have about ten creatures not including you; but they stay in the other building. I&#8217;m fond of these two; they keep me company so they will come and you will serve them,� he said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Taking me by the hand, he led me down the hall again and left me outside of one of the doors; he came back out and clipped a chain onto the two nipple rings. He hooked his finger over it and pulled down. I squirmed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�There, I knew that that&#8217;s what was missing,� he said and laughed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We heard the door open.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh, her they are,� he said happily.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I followed him as he went down the hall to meet his too friends. They were the same two men from the night before; as they looked over at me I threw my eyes to the ground. All of them sat down and the food cart came in. The servant gave it to me with hesitation and I took it over to the table. I served everything that was there and took the rest to the kitchen, leaving it and attending them.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Come over here, little slave,� one of the men finally ordered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was the taller of the two; he had curly brown hair, dark skin and blue eyes. I came over to him and he patted his knee so that I would sit on it. I took one look at my master and he nodded in approval. The man wrapped his arm round my waist and pulled on the chain.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are these new?� he asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I just did those this morning. I thought they would be a good touch,� my master said with a smile.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh they are. Aren&#8217;t you a sexy little slave? You should be proud of those!� he said laughing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His friend looked a lot like him, except for his hair was straight instead of curly and he had deep green eyes. He laughed along with everything his friend said, but didn&#8217;t speak very much himself.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you hungry?� he asked, rubbing my stomach. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I looked over at the master again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Eat up, you won&#8217;t get your own servings here, you&#8217;ll have to have scraps offered to you or you&#8217;ll have to beg,� he warned.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I nodded my head in compliance. He held up a piece of buttery toast and as I was about to take it he said, �I want to feed it to you.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I learned the hard way to never hesitate when odd things were asked of you; it was a sure shot for getting punished. I opened my mouth and was about to bit down when he moved it away from my mouth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Beg,� he said playfully.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please, could I have some,� I said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Call me your master and beg,� he ordered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His stern voice and the way he held me started to turn me on. It was hot the way he was forcing me to beg. I wanted him to order me around; I wanted him to spank me!
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please master, could I have a bite of bread? Your little slut slave is hungry,� I whispered in his ear.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His smile grew and he fed the whole toast to me. Everyone was curious now to know what I had said, but he kept it to himself.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, no, this isn&#8217;t a matter to talk about at the table; we&#8217;ll discuss it later. I have made a new discovery, gentlemen!� he said as they begged to know what I said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A smile curled on my lips as he ordered me to get on my hands and knees. He poured a small bowl full of milk and threw some sliced berries in. He set it on the floor and demanded that I eat it without using my hands; I started to lap it up playfully.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He seemed content and they began talking on other subjects. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After breakfast, he excused himself from the table and asked if he could see me privately in the library, while the other two men were preoccupied. They let him go easily and he pulled me along with him as we went to the library. He shut the door and leaned up against it as I wandered into the cozy place. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know your little secret,� he said and a mocking tone of voice.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;re a pain slut, you&#8217;re a true life slave; or at least that&#8217;s what you&#8217;ve been trained to be. You like it when people push you around; when a man tells you were to go and what to do. Your last master must have been so proud to have trained his little slave so well; to have turned her over to the dark side and she liked it over there. Am I right?� he asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I shook my head; no, trying to keep the secret away from him. Not letting him tell me something that I could barely admit to myself.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You don&#8217;t think so? It&#8217;s very easy to tell; lets experiment and I&#8217;m sure that your body will tell me more than your lying tongue,� he said. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he moved forward, I stood frozen, waiting for his command. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Bend over, my pretty girl,� he said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I did as he pleased and he started spanking me with his bare hand. I had to lean over near chair to keep myself from toppling over. The sensations in the folds of my sex began to act up again. I could feel my cheeks start to burn up and my temples start to sweat. I squealed a little moan as he pressed his fingers in between my folds with his free hands.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Wet, oh so wet and ready to get fucked. Does the little pain slut want to cum,� he asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�He grabbed my neck and pushed my chin up and he kept my back arched and my butt up for his spankings. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Tell me,� he hissed seductively.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes!� I cried.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was right; it only took is firm hand and his strong words to get me hot and wet. He threw me to the floor and started fucking me doggy style. It wasn&#8217;t long before he was finished with me and as he came inside of my pussy he rubbed my face again the floor, taking in the satisfaction of dominating me. I didn&#8217;t cum, but I was aroused by his temperament towards me. He had lured me in and captured me; I would be his slave for however long he wanted me. He pulled out and had me get on my knees and clean his dick off with my mouth. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You are a very good slave. I&#8217;ll keep this secret between us. One thing I want you to know is that your master does not like this kind of thing and that he will never pleasure&nbsp; you in that way. But he does like me and my friend and he will let us borrow you once in a while if you&#8217;re up for something like that. I have my one little place here inside the building; I&#8217;ll have you ordered in to serve me sometime soon. Would you like that?� he asked as he kissed my neck.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I sighed in pleasure.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes master,� I said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He led me out of the room and we joined the rest of the men. They talked for a while and servants eventually came in to clean up. Once the afternoon was coming to an end, the two men left and it was time to send me off too. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t want you spending every night with me, I have others come and visit me as well, my rooms are not your home; you belong with the other slaves and animals at the building across the way. Someone will come for you soon.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sure enough, a few minutes later a servant came in, she order me to come forward and wrapped a silky blind around my eyes.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t want you to know of any other place except for my rooms and your cage. Those will be the only places you will see for the rest of your life; unless otherwise ordered,� he remarked and I was led out of the room.
 She led me down the long walk that we had gone through before. We were outside and then back inside again; went had to stop a couple times to open some doors and then I was seated on a cold metal bench. I heard the door shut and I took off my blind. I was inside a large cage, about 6 square feet and there were two other ones; one to my left and another one to its left. The room that held the cages was bare with cement walls, floor and ceiling. There was a shower stall in one corner, sink and mirror; a door in the center of the opposite facing wall and a couple of lockers on the other side of the wall. The cages next to mine were empty. Inside the cage was a metal bench held up by chains, a wooly blanket and stained pillow neatly placed to the side, a toilet and a metal stool. 
Ten minutes had barely passed before the door to the room clicked open. The man from that morning came in. As he noticed me he took a sharp turn towards the lockers and fumbled through one picking things out. With a big smile on his face he came over, pulled out a key from his pocket and opened my cage door.
�On your knees, slave girl,� he said.
He set his things down on the stool and looked me over.
�For what I know; you&#8217;ll be spending some time in here, so I thought I&#8217;d preoccupy you while you waited to be used. And you will be used, probably not too much by your master, but I&#8217;ll definitely use you,� he said. 
�Lets have you come over her and I&#8217;ll get you ready,� he said.
He had me come over to the cage wall facing the cage next to me and got me on my knees again. He blindfolded me, put a gag in my mouth, and tied my hands behind my back. I felt my piercings being tugged on and then he was finished.
�I&#8217;ll see you tonight; until then, this will remind you that you are my slave and have no right of your own unless it is through me,� he said and left.
As time wore on I decided to get down fro my knees and as I moved I felt my piercings being tugged on. I had barely enough room to charge from kneeling on my knees to sitting on my rum. There was definitely not enough leeway to stand up or lay down. I heard the door open and few people come in, they were two girls and they spoke softly. The cage in front of mine was opened and closed. Someone stayed and someone left. 
 A few minutes later she spoke. 
�I&#8217;m sorry about last night. I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re not hurt. Are they torturing you now?� Red asked.
I felt her hand reach through the bars and run her fingers against my cheek. I nodded. I didn&#8217;t want to come off as some sort of freak who actually liked this stuff. 
�Do you want me to help untie you?� she offered.
I shook my head.
�No? I guess that would be smarter, just incase some one were to come in; I wouldn&#8217;t want you getting in more trouble that you are already in on your first day. Maybe we can talk when they let you have it easier. I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll get bored of you soon,� she reassured me.
After that, she didn&#8217;t say much. I listened as more people came and went. Another girl was brought in and caged. The two talked but tried, with some difficulty, to avoid me as the subject. I blurred most of their conversations out because I wasn&#8217;t interested or allowed to participate. Food was brought in, they ate, and once again I couldn&#8217;t.&nbsp; I would probably die from starvation one of these days; I was getting enough nutrition. As things started to quiet down, he reentered, I recognized his voice when he spoke to the others.
�Good evening ladies,� he said as he opened my cage.
�Oh leave her alone!� Red burst out.
�She&#8217;s an object, she&#8217;s a slave. She&#8217;s on an even lower level than us. It doesn&#8217;t matter what I do with her, she&#8217;s the master&#8217;s property and he said I could play with her,� he hissed.
�You&#8217;re evil! Don&#8217;t you get enough satisfaction from every other thing that you fuck around here!� she argued back.
�Shut your mouth or I&#8217;ll have the master order more laps for you tomorrow!� he threatened.
�Oh you&#8217;re such a kiss ass, or an ass fuck, either one! That&#8217;s the only reason the master has to like you, you have no respect from anyone else here,� she said.
He stopped paying attention to her as he took the chains off the metal bars. He untied my hands.
�I wanted you on your hands and knees; follow my lead,� he ordered.
I followed as he pulled on the chains attached to my piercings. The ground felt moist and mucky underneath me as we made our way to the other house again, but stayed on the bottom floor. He led me through some hall and into a room. I felt him slid a large foot stool underneath me lengthwise and tie my things and arms to it. This way I was still positioned on my hands and knees but I could rest my tummy and chest on the chair. He let the chains attacked to me dangle. He pulled out the mouth gag and inserted a ring gag deep with in my mouth. I moved my jaw around trying to loosen the push, but he had shoved it in deep and it was planted steadily. It didn&#8217;t take long for me to start drooling and for my mouth to run dry. He set up a brace that pushed from my shoulders to my chin and lifted my head high into the air. I silently accepted my fate for the night.
He rubbed my ass with his hand and gave it a few swats before he pushed his cock into my pussy. It slipped in easily and started to pump. But the door open and he pulled out suddenly.
�Here she is, out little cock slut,� he said and laughed.
�Wow, you really out did yourself,� his friend said.
I didn&#8217;t recognize the voice, but I guessed it was the quiet man from earlier. 
�I&#8217;ll let you choose, do you want her mouth or her ass,� he asked.
�We&#8217;ll have time for both?�
�All night,� he said
�What about the master?�
�He&#8217;s going out with his wife tonight, he agreed to the arrangement,� he persisted.
�I feel bad; are you sure she&#8217;s okay with it?�
�She&#8217;s been trained to take it and like it,� he said.
�Alright.�
There was a pause; foot steps and suddenly a cock in my mouth and my pussy. I moaned as the cock in my mouth slipped in deeper and the one in my cunt pumped vigorously. They both pulled out in time, traded places and I felt the one that had been in my mouth plunge into my ass hole and the one with my cunt juices ram into my mouth. The two strong men overwhelmed me with pleasure, occasionally slapping my face and my ass and pumping roughly. I let down my guard and let their cocks slip deeper and deeper into. The one behind pulled out and his friend took up where he left off. The veil was pulled off my face and some one&#8217;s cock squirted cum juice onto my face. The other pulled out a little later and did the same. I let my tense muscles relax as cum ran down my face. 
�Oh, she&#8217;s a good slave. Let&#8217;s give her a treat,� one of them said.
I kept my eyes shut to keep the cum out of them and to let my fantasy play out fully. I felt a vibrator turned on hand pushed into my snatch and another one that pumped slower pressed into my wet ass.&nbsp; I was expecting a beating, but one hand reach under my rib and tickled me. I giggled; it was difficult with the gag ring in my mouth. 
�I thought she&#8217;d be ticklish,� he said.
Four hands started running over my body. I burst out in laughed and started wiggling, trying to get out of the way. But I was tied down sharply and the vibrators seeped deeper and deeper as I moved. The laughed was not moans of pain and begging for release. I couldn&#8217;t make out works but I could defiantly scream as they tickled me. This was a new kind of torture and it made me feel even more defenseless than before. Someone&#8217;s cock rammed hard into my mouth as I was in the middle of another helpless scream. It quieted me and I wished with all my power than I could bite down on it and repay them for all the torture, but it slid in and out easily. The other one started caressing my clit; it didn&#8217;t take long for me to have m first orgasm and them another one. My heavy breathing made the cock inside my mouth work harder and then it came inside of me. I swallowed the cum with some difficulty and they let me rest for a minute while the vibrators continued to come. 
I opened my eyes and the cum had already started crusting over my face. The man who had brought me in pulled out the mouth ring and I moved my jaw around in relief. 
�Do you want some dinner slave,� he asked.
�Yes master,� I answered.
�You didn&#8217;t have any lunch or dinner. You must be starving. Wouldn&#8217;t a starving slave beg for her dinner harder than that?�
�I&#8217;m sorry master.�
�Tell me slave, how badly you want it,� he insisted as he held me pinched my cheeks together with his firm hand.
�I&#8217;m hungry master, please feed me, you&#8217;re cum slut, your cock slave, any thing you want me to be, wants to live, want to eat. Let her eat and continue to serve you master. There would be nothing better than to serve you master,� I said.
He too the chain attacked to my huge nose ring and pulled on it lightly.
�You are just a slave; made just to serve your master, to give your pussy and your pass and your lips up to his pleasure. Too bad your true master will never use you. He doesn&#8217;t like girls, especially dirty little cunts like you. But I&#8217;ll take care of you if you continue to give me what I want,� he said.
�I will. Serving you makes me horny and wet. I will always serve you,� I said.
He had some food brought in and fed it to me himself as his friend watched TV. I was left in my position for the rest of the night, as they fucked each other and went to bed. The vibrators had been pulled out and brace had been pulled out and I lay defeated on the stool. The next morning they had me sent back to my cage and I spent the day sleeping to make up for the lack of it the night before. Red came in later and we finally had a chance to talk.
�Once again, I&#8217;m sorry for whatever they&#8217;ve been doing to you. I know it&#8217;s not the master&#8217;s doing, he&#8217;s not that type of man. He only took you to make your old master angry. He has no intentions for you and the other two who live with him inside the house will get bored of you soon enough. In no time you&#8217;ll be free to take those piercings out and maybe even lie outside that cage,� she said.
�Yes, maybe one day,� I said.
I didn&#8217;t want that day to come, I liked being used, I liked the way my hoops were used to pull me around.
�What am I saying! I bet you want to get out of this place as badly as I do! We can run away together. I never have a chance to get inside the main house, but you do!� she said.
�Do you think we could?� I asked meekly.
�Of coarse! But now that you&#8217;re here I&#8217;ll have to contemplate a plan. It won&#8217;t be long,� she said.
When it was time to go to be we both lay awake, she came as close as she could to my cage and called out my name.
�Anna, are you awake?� she asked.
I responded to her with a grunt and came over to the end of the cage and lay next to her with the bars being the only thing separating us. She ran her fingers over my naked skin; she was clothed, everyone was always clothed except for me.
�You know I always though you were beautiful, from the minute we met. Did we have a connection when we said goodbye on the truck?� she asked quietly.
�Yes, I think so,� I said timidly.
�Let&#8217;s just lay here together and get some sleep. Soon we will be free, I&#8217;m sure of it,� she said.
The lights came on suddenly as the door opened and we had barely fallen asleep. The man who had played with me the night before had come back to summon me again. He laughed at us as he watched him and he clipped the chain onto my nose and pulled me out of the room in no time. He didn&#8217;t even bother to blind fold me as he led me out and back to the main house. Once we were inside the room I say his friend lying on the bed.
�We have just had a long night with the master and need to be pampered,� he explained.
He took the chain off and attached a smaller one that had two ends on one side and a long string of large metal balls on the other. He linked the two ended side to my nipples and asked me to bend over as he inserted the balls into my ass. Once they were all deep inside he used his finger to push them even deeper and hand me stand up straight again. As I did, the length between the chain that ran from my tits to my ass had shorted and pulled heavily on my nipples. He observed his creation and smiled. 
�You better make sure those balls stay inside your ass. You better keep that ass nice and shut because every time one of those slips out you&#8217;re getting a spanking,� he warned.
I scrunched up my ass muscles and the chain tugged even harder on my nipples. He took off his clothes and joined his naked friend on the bed. 
�Feed us these,� he ordered and pointed at the place of chocolate covered strawberries on the night stand.
Luckily I had been given food earlier throughout the day and had even been allowed to shower, so I was not envious of them.
