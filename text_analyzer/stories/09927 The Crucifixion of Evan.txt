The Crucifixion of Evan
The Idea Gains Hold
Evan was a devout Catholic in a family of devout Catholics.&nbsp; His mother was the vice principal of the 
city�s Catholic school and his father was a 15-year history teacher in the same school.&nbsp; Evan was one of 
three kids � him at 15, his little sister Mary at 12 and his older brother Matt at 17.&nbsp; 
Evan�s group of friends, all found through the church and the school, were fairly like-minded.&nbsp; They grew 
up together, attended Bible study together, went on Vacation Bible Schools together, went on camping 
trips together, played sports together, attended each other�s� birthday parties and event went on multi-
family vacations together.&nbsp; In short, Evan�s exposure to the world was limited to cocoon of like-minded 
religious acquaintances.&nbsp; As a result, Evan found himself immersed in the Christian faith and he searched 
for truth and meanings in thousands of years of writings, art, persecution, wars, legend and lore.&nbsp; For 15, 
he was one of the most studied youths in the church.&nbsp; Most boys find the outside world and the church 
becomes but a part of their lives.&nbsp; For Evan, however, his life was the faith. 
He prayed in the morning, prayed before meals, prayed at night and avoided the temptations that 
corrupted so many of his peers.&nbsp; He didn�t look down on them as he knew the path to temptation and 
sin was an easy one to walk.&nbsp; But he was very proud of upbringing and self-discipline that protected him 
from the evil forces that consumed so many.&nbsp; He also didn�t live the life of Catholic boy that seemed so 
popular to vilify in the media these days � he had never been abused, never been approached for sex by 
an adult, didn�t spend all his time jerking off or looking at porn and was still a total virgin.&nbsp; He wasn�t 
consumed by thoughts of sex.&nbsp; He was consumed, however, by the life and death of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Jesus 
was Evan�s inspiration; his purpose; his role model.
This heavenly figure lived a pure life that inspired some at the time and inspires a billion people today.&nbsp; 
The manner in which Jesus approached his untimely end is ultimately what drives Evan.&nbsp; Jesus did not 
beg for mercy, plead for leniency or curse his executioners.&nbsp; Instead, he endured the horrors with as 
much poise as any human could.&nbsp; A true sacrifice if ever there was one.
Evan spent countless hours researching the trial of Jesus (a total sham in his opinion), the public beating, 
the crown of thorns, the long walk up the hill carrying the cross, the nailing and raising into the sky, the 
suffering and the agonizingly slow death. He was just fascinated that someone could undergo such 
horrors and do so with such composure.&nbsp; 
At dinner one evening, Evan raised the topic in front of the family.
Evan: �Dad, I wanna play Jesus in the next pageant.�
Dad: �Don�t you think you�re a bit young for that Evan?&nbsp; John�s played that role for the past couple years.&nbsp; 
He�s 30 and is closer in age to Jesus than you.�
Evan: �Yeah I know.&nbsp; It�s just I think this is the path I�ve been looking for.&nbsp; If I can experience what Jesus 
went through, I know it will bring me closer to God.�
Dad: �That�s true son.&nbsp; It probably would, but you�re just too young.&nbsp; Try out for one of the Roman 
solider parts.&nbsp; I know you�ve spent a lot of time studying this so you should be a shoe in for the part.�
Evan almost choked on his asparagus: �I could never do that.&nbsp; I could never beat Jesus!�
Dad: �Yeah I know it�s the toughest part in the production and has really made some grown men cry 
while performing it.�
Mary: �It�d be cool seeing Evan beaten!�
Mom: �Mary Elizabeth!&nbsp; That was out of line young lady and not very nice at all to say about your 
brother.�
Mary looked down at her place: �I�m sorry mom.�
Mom: �And?�
Mary looked at Evan: �I�m sorry Evan.&nbsp; I didn�t mean it.�
Evan: �It�s okay sis.&nbsp; I really want this.�
Mom: �Your father is right.&nbsp; You�re too young.&nbsp; Someone would probably think it�s child abuse to let a 
15-year-old be treated so rough, even if it was for the sacred passion performance.�
Evan: �But what can I do?�
Dad: �If you don�t want to play a Roman solider, find another part to play.&nbsp; The closer you get to the 
performance in the play, maybe you will be ready for the big role in a couple years.�
Evan looked disappointed but undeterred: �I guess.�

Evan knew what had to happen.&nbsp; He needed to experience what Jesus experienced (except death of 
course).&nbsp; After he would be as close to God as any mortal man could be.&nbsp; The allure of achieving that 
state of existence was too powerful to dismiss just because he was too young to perform in the annual 
play.
In the following year�s performance, Evan played the role of a shepherd, a minor role with no speaking 
part.&nbsp; He spent all of him time during rehearsals and the live performance focusing on John, who 
reprised his role as Jesus.&nbsp; John did just an amazing job.&nbsp; He emotions were genuine, his acting 
completely realistic, his reactions to the beatings frighteningly believable.&nbsp; Evan was envious, but he 
came to realize what his parents tried to tell him � he wasn�t ready for this role.&nbsp; He could not pull it off 
as well as John has all these years.
The realization disheartened Evan.&nbsp; He so wanted to experience these trials.&nbsp; No, he needed to 
experience them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Walking in the footsteps of Jesus and finding the strength to overcome the obstacles 
would be his ticket into an enlightened adulthood.&nbsp; This setback only fueled Evan�s determination to 
make this happen.

Early in his 16th year, Evan presented a rough idea of his plan to his mother.&nbsp; He knew (or at least hoped) 
she would understand and support him.&nbsp; The plan called for a baptism of a different sort � a realistic 
recreation of Jesus�s final days in the most realistic means possible.&nbsp; Evan would suffer degradation, 
humiliation, hardship, pain, suffering and despair, just as their Lord and Savior had done so long ago.&nbsp; 
Mom: �Oh honey, this is the noblest idea I have ever heard of.&nbsp; But just as Jesus died, surely would you.�
Evan: �No I don�t want to die.&nbsp; I need this to give my life purpose.&nbsp; I need it to be as real as possible but I 
need to survive it.&nbsp; I�ve done a ton of research and know how to do it.�
Mom: �How would you survive the nails?�
Evan: �You know the devouts in the Philippines who are crucified every year?&nbsp; Well, I know where they 
put the nails so it doesn�t break bones or cause lasting damage.�
Mom: �Okay.&nbsp; Well, what about hanging on a cross for that long.&nbsp; You wouldn�t be able to breath.�
Evan: �Yeah&nbsp; I couldn�t be up there for 3-4 days.&nbsp; I�m thinking 24 hours max.&nbsp; Maybe 12.�
Mom: �That�s a relief.&nbsp; I just don�t know honey.&nbsp; I couldn�t bear to see you go through what Jesus did.&nbsp; It 
would be horrible.&nbsp; What about the whipping?&nbsp; That tore his skin apart.�
Evan: �I figured out that if the skin and fat are torn but I don�t tear up the muscles and tendons, I should 
be okay.&nbsp; This is one thing I have to experience as real as possible.&nbsp; I need to bleed the ground.&nbsp; I need 
scars to forever remind me of His sacrifice.&nbsp; Do you understand mom?�
Mom looked down at the table, almost in despair: �You�re going to make me cry Evan.&nbsp; What you want is 
so beautiful and yet so horrible.&nbsp; I just don�t know.&nbsp; You�re such a good boy.�
Evan: �Mom, please.&nbsp; I have to do this.&nbsp; I�ve been searching for my path forever and I finally found it.&nbsp; I 
need to walk the path of our Lord and Savior.&nbsp; I need to suffer as he suffered.&nbsp; I need to be tested.&nbsp; I will 
come out of this a new person.&nbsp; I will train the rest of the year, plan all the details, get everything lined 
up and do this on my 17th birthday.�
Mom: �You really have your mind set to this don�t you?&nbsp; Have you spoken with your father?�
Evan: �Yes I do mother, and no I haven�t.&nbsp; I wanted your blessing first.�
Mom: �Oh honey I�m so proud of you.&nbsp; I can�t imagine a more wonderful way to show your devotion.&nbsp; I 
worry about you, how much this will hurt you and scar you forever, but I know you will wear these 
memories and marks with pride.&nbsp; You will become an inspiration to others.&nbsp; You will get followers.�
Evan: �I�m not doing this for anyone else but me, mom.&nbsp; I can�t think about anything else.&nbsp; I�m not 
looking forward to the pain, but I need to experience it.&nbsp; Does that make any sense?�
Mom: �Yes honey it does.&nbsp; I love you so much.&nbsp; Come here.�
Mom held her son tight in her arms and told her son what he was waiting for: �I will support you my 
loving Evan.&nbsp; I�ll even help you convince your father.�
Evan: �Thank you so much.&nbsp; This means everything to me.�
Convincing dad was surprisingly simple.&nbsp; It took maybe an hour to explain what Evan had planned and, 
more important, why he was doing this and what he hoped to gain as a person.&nbsp; His father asked a lot of 
questions to gauge Evan�s intent to follow through, even when things become unbearable.&nbsp; Evan did a 
good job convincing his father of his drive and dedication.&nbsp; In the end, the experience would be so 
powerful that his father was not only on board, but offered to help his son pull it off.&nbsp; He, like his wife, 
was now so proud of his son.&nbsp; He only wished he had the courage to do something like this.&nbsp; He agreed 
that Evan would garner a huge following after this act was done. 
Everyone�s chief concern was how Evan�s body would survive the assaults placed upon it.&nbsp; They agreed 
he needed to be in outstanding physical shape.&nbsp; A solid, athletic body would be able to endure the 
forthcoming hardships much better than a lazy body.&nbsp; Fortunately that wouldn�t take much work.&nbsp; Evan 
was healthy, slim, fit, ate the right foods, stayed very active and was a fine specimen of young man.&nbsp; 
What he didn�t have, however, was a regimented workout routine.&nbsp; Evan liked running so he asked the 
school track coach about a program that he could employ over the next 9 months.&nbsp; The next day, Evan 
was running 6 miles a day, split between morning and evening.&nbsp; It was probably too much to start right 
away, but he was determined like no other.
While he was conditioning his body, planning was underway.&nbsp; The entire family was on board at this 
point and they treated it very much as a family project.&nbsp; Dad took the lead as he had the best contacts in 
the church community.&nbsp; At a family meeting, Evan handed out a list of his must-haves:
1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I will be starved and placed in isolation for 3 days; water would be okay
2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I will be placed in isolation nude and remain so throughout the event
3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I will receive 39 lashes
4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I will wear a crown of thorns
5. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nails will be driven through my hands and feet
6. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cross will have a horn on it
7. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While on the cross, my front side should be scourged
8. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At least 200 people should witness this
9. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The event should be recorded
10. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My goal is 24 hours on the cross
11. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I want my lower legs broken near the end

Expressions varied as each family member read down the list.&nbsp; Mom�s face turned pale white by the end.&nbsp; 
Dad slowly shook his head back and forth.&nbsp; Mary opened her mouth in shock and never closed it.&nbsp; Matt 
was speechless.&nbsp; How could his little brother want this.&nbsp; Yeah, he was brought up in the same religious 
family, but he was having the hardest time understanding this.&nbsp; Reading this confirmed Evan was 
borderline insane and was on the road to becoming like a cult leader.&nbsp; 
Evan: �Okay, before you say anything, I want to explain each one.&nbsp; First, I need to get myself in the 
headspace of what Jesus faced so I need to be worn down.&nbsp; Being starved and placed in isolation for 3 
days will do that.&nbsp; I will get very weak and I�m sure I�ll have a tough time focusing.&nbsp; I can survive on water 
for 3 days.&nbsp; Plus I�ll be in great shape by then so it will be easier to endure.�
Evan: �Second, I have to be nude throughout this whole thing.&nbsp; Jesus was nude when crucified and I will 
be as well.&nbsp; I know it will be humiliating and that will add to the power of the experience.&nbsp; Next, I need to 
be scourged like Jesus � 39 lashes on the back.&nbsp; Forty lashes was considered a death sentence so one 
less is what the condemned received.&nbsp; I�ve done enough research to know that I can�t have my muscles 
and tendons torn, but skin and fat are okay.&nbsp; So we�ll need to come up with the right thing to sew onto 
the end of the whip strands.&nbsp; I also need to wear a crown of thorns.&nbsp; Now for the nails.�
Evan took a slow deep breath and exhaled: �In order for this to be real, I need to be nailed to the cross.&nbsp; 
I�ve studied the Philippines annual ritual and it can be done.&nbsp; You can actually nail through the hands and 
feet safely, without paralysis.&nbsp; What I can�t do, unfortunately, is have spikes driven through my wrists, 
which is probably what Jesus endured.&nbsp; That would destroy too much.&nbsp; I tried and tried to figure out how 
to make that happen, but nails through the hands will have to do.&nbsp; I have another way to make up for 
the lack of suffering.�
Evan: �This next part is tough and I saw the look you made mom when you read it.&nbsp; Real crucifixions had 
horns on the cross.�&nbsp; Mary looked up inquisitively.&nbsp; She had no idea what this was.&nbsp; Evan looked right 
into Mary�s eyes.&nbsp; �Mary, this is gross, but don�t worry.&nbsp; It�s real.&nbsp; A horn is a long piece of wood, like a 
broom handle that is attached to the middle of the upright.&nbsp; I sit on it and it violates me.&nbsp; Every time I try 
to relieve pressure on my wrists by pushing myself up, I repeatedly sodemize myself.&nbsp; It�s painful and 
very degrading.&nbsp; That�s the point and it has to be done.�
Evan�s mom started to protest but Evan cut him off.&nbsp; �Please mom, let me finish.&nbsp; As I said earlier, I need 
to make up for the fact that I can�t be nailed through the wrists.&nbsp; I therefore want to be scourged on my 
front side while I�m hanging on the cross.&nbsp; Since I won�t be up there the full 3-4 days, this should work 
fine.&nbsp; Also there has to be a crowd witnessing what will happen to me and it should be professionally 
recorded.&nbsp; I desperately want to make it up there 24 hours with no water or food or water.&nbsp; And finally, 
you may know that sometimes the lower legs are broken to hasten death.&nbsp; With the legs fractured, you 
cannot raise yourself.&nbsp; I want that done towards the end.&nbsp; Ok that�s it.�
Mom was the first to chime in: �Evan, my son, this goes too far.&nbsp; You cannot survive this.&nbsp; It�s too much.&nbsp; 
How did you come up with this?�
Evan: �It�s all brutal, but it�s true to what really happened.&nbsp; Nothing is made up.�
Mary: �But Jesus wasn�t naked.&nbsp; He had a white robe on.�
Evan: �Well, actually not.&nbsp; He was naked when the Romans beat him and he was naked on the cross.&nbsp; 
We�re just too ashamed to show Jesus as he really was.&nbsp; They degraded and humiliated him in every way 
possible.&nbsp; They tried to destroy his essence.&nbsp; But they failed.&nbsp; They created the greatest man who ever 
lived.�
Dad: �Is that what you hope to become?&nbsp; Another Jesus?�
Evan laughed: �Not at all.&nbsp; I want to have an experience as close as possible to what Jesus experienced 
and I want raw inspiration.&nbsp; I want to reach a level of spiritual clarity I�ve been searching for my whole 
life.�
Matt: �You all know I�m the last one to understand why you need to do this.&nbsp; I mean your body will be 
scarred forever.&nbsp; You may walk with a limp.&nbsp; Your hands and feet will always have visible signs of holes.&nbsp; 
And now you want to get beaten on your front side as well.&nbsp; Do you know how bad that can be?�
Evan: �Yeah, I know.&nbsp; It�s okay.�
Matt: �No, do you really know how bad that could be?&nbsp; I mean if someone�s whipping you on your front, 
they could, you know, miss and hit something important.�&nbsp; Matt was blushing trying to find a coy way to 
state the obvious.
Evan: �I know what you�re trying to say.&nbsp; And it�s okay.&nbsp; I am prepared to face the consequences.�
Matt: �Even if that means never having kids?&nbsp; Really?�
Evan: �Yes.�
Mom: �No way Evan.&nbsp; Now you�ve gone too far.&nbsp; You can�t risk that much.�
Evan: �And Jesus risked less?�
Dad: �He was the King of the Jews.&nbsp; You are not.�
Evan: �No I�m not, but I will walk in his footsteps.&nbsp; I will endure what he endured. And I want Matt to be 
the one to scourge me.�
Matt: �WHAT?�
Evan: �Yes, Matt.&nbsp; It�s you.&nbsp; My brother should be the one to do this.�
Matt: �There�s absolutely no way.&nbsp; Forget it.&nbsp; I don�t believe in this quest of yours and I�m certainly not 
going to participate in your destruction.�
Dad: �Now hold on a minute.&nbsp; This makes sense.&nbsp; Granted you�re not Roman and you haven�t been 
ordered to carry out the awful deeds, but you are a member of this family and I can�t think of anyone I 
would trust more than you to do this.�
Matt: �No way.&nbsp; I can�t beat my own brother, tearing his flesh.�
Evan: �Please Matt.&nbsp; I�m begging you.&nbsp; I need you to do this for me.�
Mom: �Evan and your father are right.&nbsp; I can�t have someone else beat my son.&nbsp; You have to do this.�
Matt: �Oh come on.&nbsp; How can this be put on me?�
Mom: �You know why.&nbsp; Do you honestly want someone else doing this to him?�
Matt: �I don�t want anyone doing this to him.�&nbsp; Matt sighed and the room went silent.&nbsp; No more 
convincing; more prodding.&nbsp; Everyone was waiting on Matt to respond.&nbsp; At least a minute of deafening 
silence elapsed when Matt finally relented.&nbsp; �Whatever.&nbsp; If I have to.�
Evan: �Thank you my brother.&nbsp; You have to do this all the way.&nbsp; You can�t hold back.&nbsp; It will be bloody 
and horrible and I�ll scream.&nbsp; But you must see this through for me.&nbsp; I�ll never get another chance like 
this.�
Matt: �Sure.�
Dad: �Matt will do his job.&nbsp; Let�s get back to the legs.&nbsp; You don�t need your legs broken.�
Evan: �It�s part of it.&nbsp; Plus it�s easy enough to get them repaired.&nbsp; If I�m going to put myself through this, 
I�m going all the way.&nbsp; I will not chinch on anything.�
Dad: �There�s no proof Jesus ever had his legs broken.�
Evan: �No there�s not.&nbsp; But it was very common in crucifixions of the time.�
Dad: �I�m not convinced.&nbsp; This will be brutal enough.�
Evan: �Yeah this whole thing is brutal.&nbsp; Because it was real.&nbsp; Jesus suffered and they didn�t hold anything 
back.&nbsp; Dad, this has to be just as realistic.&nbsp; My legs will heal.&nbsp; Doc Hendrix will fix them.�
There was silence as everyone in the family took this in.&nbsp; Mom was thinking how proud she was of her 
son, but was afraid he was going too far.&nbsp; Matt was fixating on his new role in this whole thing.&nbsp; Mary 
was having a hard time processing all this.&nbsp; It just wasn�t sinking in quite yet.&nbsp; But it was dad who was still 
giving his son the benefit of the doubt and wanted to give his son all the support he could.
Dad: �Tell you what.&nbsp; I�ll let you do everything you want, but I�m going to put some safety practices in 
places to ensure you survive and recover.&nbsp; Deal?�
Evan: �Deal.&nbsp; Thanks you guys.&nbsp; This means everything to me and I love you all so much!�

As the months marched on, Evan intensified his daily exercise routine, running 6-10 miles per day.&nbsp; He 
was already in great shape and was diligently preparing his heart for the trials that lay ahead.&nbsp; He wasn�t 
building muscle mass, but rather aimed to become lean and toned.&nbsp; A thin look, he thought, would be 
more authentic.&nbsp; In fact, he started a vegetarian diet six months out and also significantly limited his 
caloric intake.&nbsp; As with the rest of this project, he became obsessed with achieving a look that would be 
appropriate.&nbsp; He started his 16th year at 6� and 150 pounds.&nbsp; His goal was to lose 25 pounds.

Meanwhile, Evan�s father met with members of the church, attorneys and the family doctor.&nbsp; The 
logistics were many, the legal concerns were complex and medical worries were genuine.&nbsp; Fortunately 
this was going to happen on Evan�s 17th birthday.&nbsp; That makes him a legal adult and giving self-consent is 
much easier than relying on parental consent.&nbsp; Over five months, Evan�s dad put everything in place.&nbsp; As 
they did often during the planning, they had a family meeting.&nbsp; This time, the focus was Evan�s safety.&nbsp; 
Dad presented the following list:
1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Evan�s on the cross, he will have 2 IV lines run into him and will be fed ringers, glucose 
and/or bicarb as needed
2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All nails will be sterilized
3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nail placement will be critical to avoid hand and foot paralysis
4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Evan will undergo counseling before and after the event
5. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Evan will receive no beatings to the face or head
6. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Evan will have to have all hair below his neck removed so as not to serve as contamination for 
his broken skin
7. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Evan will receive a Tetanus shot
8. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Evan�s wrists will be roped to the cross to ensure the nails don�t rip through Evan�s hands
9. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The scourging whip will have metal balls tied to the ends of the strands rather than jagged bone 
or rock
10. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The crown of thorns will be replaced with a crown of barbed wire
11. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When finished, Dr. Hendrix will immediately tend to Evan�s injuries
12. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Only the selected video crew from church will be allowed to record the event
Evan: �IV lines?&nbsp; Jesus didn�t have IV lines.�
Dad: �Jesus also died on the Cross.&nbsp; You will not.�
Evan: �But those drugs will make it too easy for me.&nbsp; It won�t be realistic.�
Dad: � Doc Hendrix and I discussed this and knew you wouldn�t like it.&nbsp; But with as much trauma as your 
body will receive, you could easily go into shock and die.&nbsp; The fluids will help keep you alive.&nbsp; We do 
promise to only use them when needed, and then only as much as necessary.&nbsp; You won�t notice it and 
you will still be able to fully experience being crucified.�
Evan: �Alright, if you promise.&nbsp; Thanks dad.&nbsp; So, a foot rest?&nbsp; I need to hang by my hands.�
Dad: �That simply won�t be possible son.&nbsp; The nails in your feet won�t be able to go through the ankles, 
which is how it normally would have been done.&nbsp; Instead, the nails will go through the top of each foot 
and into a rest that we�ll install at 45 degrees.&nbsp; It will also be placed high enough so your knees bend and 
the rest won�t hold much of your weight.&nbsp; Instead, the horn will do that.�
Evan: �Ok that sounds good.&nbsp; How long will the horn be?�
Dad: �We�ve decided on 12� long and 2� wide.&nbsp;&nbsp; That should be big enough to cause you severe pain and 
the tearing will cause bleeding which will serve as lubrication.&nbsp; We�ll position it on the cross upright so it 
will be fully inserted when you slouch all the way down.�
Evan: �Wow you guys really thought this through.�
Dad: �Yes we did son.&nbsp; You inspired me by what you�re doing and I�m going to everything I can to make 
this as realistic as possible for you.�
Evan, mom and dad grasped each other�s� hands around the table and said a short prayer.&nbsp; When done, 
Evan turned to Matt.
Evan: �So, are you ready?�
Matt: �Yeah I think so.&nbsp; I�ve been practicing with the whip and have gotten pretty good at it.&nbsp; At least I�m 
not longer hitting myself!� They all chuckled.&nbsp; �I�ve also been practicing throwing the baseball again so 
that�s strengthening my arm so I can swing harder.&nbsp; I�ve gotten to where I can give 39 full force strikes 
without letting up at all.&nbsp; I�ve also been working on a mannequin and I�m good at hitting the whole front 
side of the body without hitting its head.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that we settled on the tips of the cat, I�ll install them and 
continue training.�
Evan: �That�s perfect Matt.&nbsp; Thanks so much for helping me with this.&nbsp; It will be so much nicer knowing 
it�s you who is beating me.�
Matt: �It�s alright bro.&nbsp; I�ve come around and am proud to be there for you during this.�
Mom: �Evan, how much do you weigh now?�
Evan: �I�m finally down to 125, right where I wanted to be and I still have 2 months to go.�
Mom: �You should stop there.&nbsp; You almost look unhealthy you�re so skinny.�
Evan: �Oh no, I�ve never felt better.&nbsp; I have so much energy I don�t know what to do with it.&nbsp; Plus I need 
to look a little sickly for the crowd.�
Mom: �Hey now, you said this wasn�t about them, but about you.�
Evan: �Yeah, you�re right.&nbsp; I�m seriously doing this for myself.&nbsp; I really am.&nbsp; I think I�m looking right for 
this.�
Mom: �If you say so, but just be careful.�
Evan: �I will be mom.�


As the final week approached, everything was falling into place.&nbsp; Two hundred fifty-seven people were 
invited to attend this momentous event, well beyond the 200 that Evan hoped for.&nbsp; Mom, who 
coordinated invitations, had to cut off at 250 due to space constraints.&nbsp; But seven more snuck onto the 
list with good reasons.&nbsp; Evan�s extended family would there, as well as a couple dozen friends from 
school, church leadership, prominent church members, medical personnel, support people, church 
caterers, etc.&nbsp; 
The family farm was more of a ranch/farm than a traditional crop growing farm.&nbsp; There was a large pen 
area for sheep, another pen for horses, a chicken coup, a couple barns, open fields and some wheat 
crop.&nbsp; The area had hills and was nicely tucked away in a valley so there was little concern for prying 
eyes.
The center of attention would be a raised hill with a heavy beam wooden cross firmly situated in place.&nbsp; 
The curved mound rose a few feet above the surrounding terrain, just enough to give the crucified some 
height.&nbsp; This area had to be built up since it�s typically used as a fire pit.&nbsp; Leading to the hill was a long, 
winding path that started at the 2-story farm house.&nbsp; It was about 100 yards long and covered in dirt.&nbsp; 
On either side of the path was beautifully mowed bluegrass.&nbsp; Next to the family house was a large barn 
for storing farm equipment, feed, tools, a small work shop, etc.&nbsp; Inside the barn was a small room where 
the sharp and expensive tools were stored.&nbsp; Those were cleared out and that room would serve as 
Evan�s solitary confinement.&nbsp; 
Surrounding the cross were rented bleachers, three levels high each.&nbsp; The bleachers were arranged in a 
semi-circular pattern covering a 180 degree arc from the left side of the cross, to the front of the cross, 
ending at the right side of the cross.&nbsp; Each participant would have a clear view of the ceremony.&nbsp; 
Completing the scene was a pair of ultra-quiet generator light trailers.&nbsp; These light trailers would bathe 
Evan in light as he hung on the cross overnight.
Evan�s mother completed the crown of barbed wire.&nbsp; She was proud of her creation and took great care 
in its construction.&nbsp; She wrapped a sterile line of barbed wire three times around a mold resulting in 
sharp spikes protruding in all directions about every inch.&nbsp; She then interwove green leaves into the 
crown creating a visually appealing design.&nbsp; Even though she wore gloves while she constructed the 
crown, she did manage to knick her fingers a few times, drawing blood.&nbsp; She knew this would be horrible 
for her precious son, yet she couldn�t wait to see it on him.

On the evening before Evan�s confinement, Evan and his entire family had their last normal dinner 
together.&nbsp; They prayed at length and Evan asked for the strength to endure the trials set before him.&nbsp; It 
was a solemn occasion and there was little talking.&nbsp; By this time, Evan had worked himself into such a 
mental fortress that hardly anything could faze him.&nbsp;&nbsp; His self-discipline, determination and strong faith 
inspired everyone who he encountered these past few months.&nbsp; As dinner continued in silence, Evan 
spoke up.
Evan spoke softly and purposefully: �I want to thank you, my dear family, for supporting me on this trial 
of a lifetime.&nbsp; I am about to embark on something that will change who I am.&nbsp; I will go to sleep one 
person tonight and awaken in 4 days as someone new.&nbsp; With your help, I will make it through this.&nbsp; But I 
have to plead, especially to you Matt, not to go easy on me.&nbsp; While I will try not to beg, scream and cry, I 
might weaken.&nbsp; For this to work, you have to follow through with the brutal treatment of my body.&nbsp; Will 
you do this for me brother?�
Matt: �Evan, it will be very difficult to hurt you so horribly, to cause you to bleed, to rip your skin, but I 
know what you�re trying to accomplish and you�ve somehow managed to inspire me.&nbsp; I will do my part 
even if I cry right alongside you.�
Evan: �Thank you so much.&nbsp; I love you.�
Matt: �I love you too.�
Dad: �Everything is set.&nbsp; When you wake up tomorrow, your mother will shave your body and will place 
you in isolation.&nbsp; This will be your last meal.&nbsp; You will not be allowed to use the bathroom in the 
morning.&nbsp; As soon as you wake up at 6 a.m., your trial begins.&nbsp; Inside the storage room, you will have 
access to a hose with water.&nbsp; Nothing more.&nbsp; We will leave you in complete isolation and will not check 
on you.&nbsp; If you need or want anything at all, we will not hear you.&nbsp; Everyone has been given strict 
instructions to not go in or near the barn.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pastor will padlock you inside the room and will also padlock 
the barn doors.&nbsp; This is very dangerous, but it�s important you be completely isolated and alone.&nbsp; When 
times are tough, pray and you will make it through it.&nbsp; Also imagine the further trials that await you and 
that will give you strength, my son.�
Evan stated with great poise: �I am ready.&nbsp; I have no fear at all and my mind is clear.�
Mom whispered with a tear: �You make us all so proud.�
Evan went to bed around 10 p.m. and fell fast asleep, having one of the most peaceful sleeping nights of 
his life. 

The Day of Reckoning
Morning came early and mom had to wake even up at 6 a.m.&nbsp; He was groggy as he awoke, forcing his 
eyes to focus on his mother standing beside his bed.&nbsp; As he came to, he couldn�t recall the last time he 
had such a perfect sleep.&nbsp; He slowly sat up and moved his feet over the edge of the bed.&nbsp; He took a deep 
breath, got up and immediately kneeled down beside his bed, hands pressed together in prayer.&nbsp; A 
minute of whispering to himself, he stood up, pushed his boxer shorts down and stood before his 
mother naked and unashamed.&nbsp; 
Mom took in his son�s body, something she had not seen in its bare form in nearly a decade.&nbsp; The first 
thing she noticed was how well Evan toned his body these past few months.&nbsp; His 6� frame slimmed to 
120 pounds and his vegetarian diet kept his complexion silky smooth.&nbsp; In the standing position, his ribs 
were visible and his stomach was slightly sunken.&nbsp; He had no facial hair, no chest hair, average hair on 
his groin and very little fuzz growing from his arms and legs.&nbsp; The hair on his head was several inches 
long and had a nice wave flowing through it.&nbsp; He had a cute button nose and soft hazel eyes.
Mom led her emotionless son into the bathroom and proceeded to shave him.&nbsp; Over the next half hour, 
she used shaving cream and a razor to remove all of the hair below his neck, being very careful not to 
knick him.&nbsp; Evan hardly knew what was happening.&nbsp; He was mentally in a different place.&nbsp; Mom had to 
tell him twice to bend over and spread his cheeks so she could get the small tufts of hair hiding near his 
hole.&nbsp; Was it necessary for this event?&nbsp; Of course not, but mom was intent on being as thorough with her 
roles as Evan was intent on being with his.&nbsp; While he had little body hair to begin with, he looked even 
younger when devoid of the little bit that was beginning to define him as a man.&nbsp; Evan showered and 
mom dried him off.
The pair proceeded to the kitchen where the rest of the family, the Church�s pastor, Doc Hendrix and 
family attorney were already assembled.&nbsp; Mary blushed and she saw her naked brother walking in.&nbsp; This 
was a first for her.&nbsp; Dad and Matt were surprised at how skinny he was.&nbsp; Evan stood in the middle of the 
kitchen, hands at his side, as the pastor asked Evan if he was ready to begin.&nbsp; He nodded.
Pastor approached and gently placed a hand on Evan�s left shoulder: �Evan, today is your seventeenth 
birthday and you are about to embark on a mission that will define your entry into adulthood.&nbsp; You will 
walk the path of Jesus Christ and will be subjected to trials similar to those He faced.&nbsp; You have prepared 
mentally and physically for this day.&nbsp; You are ready.&nbsp; Let�s pray.�&nbsp; Everyone gathered grasped the hand of 
another in the room, lowered their heads and listened intently as the Pastor led the room in deep 
prayer.&nbsp; Upon conclusion, the doctor spoke up.
Doc Hendrix: �As you know, Evan, this event is wrought with medical risk.&nbsp; During the next three days 
you will be starved and isolated.&nbsp; You may not survive.&nbsp; If you do, your body will then be pushed to the 
limits of human capacity.&nbsp; You will be scarred for life.&nbsp; But, none of us here wish to see you perish so we 
will take prudent precautions.&nbsp; These measures have been discussed for months and are to be used only 
when necessary.&nbsp; Read this document carefully, including the consent clauses and the sections 
pertaining to risk of mutilation and death.�
Evan read the two page document and looked up when complete.&nbsp; The attorney pointed out the places 
for Evan to initial and sign.&nbsp; He signed three copies.&nbsp; While it was unnecessary for anyone else to sign the 
contract since he was no longer a minor, the family attorney thought it wise to cover bases so there 
were provisions for many signatures, including his parents, the Church, the doctor, the attorney and 
even Matt, who would perform much of the physical beatings.
Attorney: �With three original documents signed, you can begin.�
As agreed to, Evan now belonged to the Pastor.&nbsp; Evan�s mother formed tears in her eyes and his father 
formed a lump in his throat.&nbsp; So the time has come.&nbsp; This was really going to happen.&nbsp; She wanted to 
jump across the kitchen and hug her son, but she knew that could not happen.&nbsp; She hoped beyond hope 
that she would not lose her beautiful boy.
The pastor led Evan out of the kitchen, outside and towards the barn.&nbsp; It was already 80 degrees and 
humid.&nbsp; Evan walked in slow motion as he noticed the small, puffy clouds in the sky, the sounds of birds 
and farm animals making nature�s song and he even glimpsed at the area where he would hang in three 
short days.&nbsp; At this point, Evan was alone with the pastor.&nbsp; The other family members looked on from 
the deck.&nbsp; 
As the pair disappeared behind the barn doors, no words were exchanged.&nbsp; Both knew where they were 
headed.&nbsp; Evan entered the interior room without delay and with what little light was available, he 
surveyed the space.&nbsp; It was as he remembered, except the tools were gone.&nbsp; The room was 6� wide, 8� 
deep and about 12� tall.&nbsp; The light bulb that used to be in there had been removed and the power 
outlets flipped off at the breakers.&nbsp; The dirt floor was barren, the hooks that previously held the sharp 
tools had been removed and all that remained was vertical walls covered in empty peg board.&nbsp; As 
promised, the far corner had a garden hose with a small handle to regulate flow.
Again, no words were exchanged.&nbsp; Once Evan was inside, the pastor closed the thick wooden plank door 
behind him, applied the solid padlock and walked out of the barn.&nbsp; Once outside, he applied another 
lock and that was it.&nbsp; Evan tried to adjust his eyes to the dark, seeing if any light would leak through.&nbsp; 
Normally that might have been the case, but Evan�s father took care over the past few weeks to seal the 
cracks.&nbsp; However, to ensure some airflow, slats in the roof allowed some air exchange.
The Isolation
The first thing Evan did was locate the hose and take a drink.&nbsp; He had no water since waking up and 
needed to hydrate.&nbsp; He also realized he had to pee.&nbsp; He did not have the opportunity this morning, 
between being shaved and showering.&nbsp; Well, truth be told, he could have urinated in the shower, but he 
held it.&nbsp; The hose with fresh water was in the back-right corner of his little prison, so he chose to pee in 
the back-left corner.&nbsp; He felt out the features of the room and proceeded to release his liquid.&nbsp; The noisy 
experience also resulted in some of the pee splattering on his bare lower legs.&nbsp; He didn�t care.&nbsp; He knew 
worse things were in store for him.
He proceeded to what he thought was the center of the room, knelt down and prayed.&nbsp; Time passed by 
slow for Evan as his sense of time eroded within the first few hours in isolation.&nbsp;&nbsp; He passed the time by 
praying, pacing, thinking about the trials that lay ahead, working out and sleeping.&nbsp; What he didn�t do 
was eat.&nbsp; But that first day, he had to empty the previous night�s dinner.&nbsp; Evan held it for hours, but 
eventually he could hold no longer.&nbsp; He squatted in the same back-left corner where he urinated and let 
it out.&nbsp; The stench was overwhelming, but there was nothing he could do.&nbsp; There were some room 
between a few of the slats that made up the walls and that allowed for some air exchange, but the 
stench never really went away since the fresh pile seemed to supply a never-ceasing supply of odor.&nbsp; 
Eventually Evan got used to it, but that first day and night were the worst.
Waking up after several hours of sleep, Evan had no idea if it was day or night.&nbsp; Still no light leaked into 
his tiny room and the lack of stimuli was disorienting.&nbsp; Adding to the disorientation was a worsening 
hunger.&nbsp; The hunger pains increased in intensity during his isolation and they slowly wore him down.&nbsp; 
While he had plenty to drink, his slender body had little spare nutrition.&nbsp; By the end of day 2, he could 
hardly remain conscious.&nbsp; 
On the morning of day 3 the weather took a turn for the worst.&nbsp; Evan could hardly breathe with the lack 
of airflow, the ever-present odor in the corner and the humidity that permeated everything.&nbsp; There was 
no air flow and he could tell today was hotter than the previous two.&nbsp; The time of day was elusive but 
outside, the world knew it was 90 degrees by 8 a.m.&nbsp; By noon the temperature was already 100; there 
was no wind to filter inside the barn and the conditions became unbearable.&nbsp; The temperature inside 
the barn quickly rose to 120 degrees, which transferred into Evan�s tiny room.&nbsp; In fact, with his body 
heat, it was a couple degrees warmer.&nbsp; Evan tried to work out, but was completely exhausted, unable to 
move.&nbsp; He was a mass of flesh and bone on the ground, breathing heavily, starving and without the 
strength to function.&nbsp; 
Time was no ally as the temperature continued to rise throughout the afternoon, leveling off around 
107 in the afternoon and 130 inside.&nbsp; At some unknown point, after Evan drank as much water as he 
could hold, he passed out and started to undergo hyperthermia.&nbsp; His heart rate quickened, he was 
having trouble sweating (primarily because his dirt-covered body was turning into mud-covered with all 
the sweating up to now) and he was having trouble concentrating.&nbsp; The lack of food for the past several 
days was not helping.&nbsp; If it had not been for his exceptional health before going into confinement, Evan 
probably would not have survived.&nbsp; Outside, the doctor and his parents were worried.&nbsp; They knew how 
hot it got inside the barn and could only imagine how improbable it was that Evan could endure such 
unending punishment from Mother Nature herself.&nbsp; They broached the subject several times of going 
inside to check on him, to see if he was still alive or in need of fluids.&nbsp; But each time someone in the 
family talked the others out of it.&nbsp; They knew the risks and if anyone could survive this first ordeal, it 
would be Evan.
Meanwhile, Evan lay in an unconscious state throughout the third afternoon.&nbsp; Perhaps it was for the 
best.&nbsp; He had not defecated since the first day he arrived and had been having such a hard time 
concentrating by the end of the second day that he couldn�t even pray without losing his train of 
thought.&nbsp; As the heat cooked the barn, the isolation room and its inhabitant, Evan continued to 
deteriorate.&nbsp; His core body temperature steadily rose to the point where brain cells were starting to fry.&nbsp; 
Unbeknownst to anyone, Evan�s permanent alterations began during the scorching afternoon of day 3 in 
confinement.
Sometime overnight on his last night in isolation, Evan awoke, shivering and delirious.&nbsp; It took him an 
extended period of time to figure out where he was and what he was doing here.&nbsp; He somehow knew 
where the hose was and continued to hydrate himself.&nbsp; But by this point, his strength was gone.&nbsp; He 
crawled to the hose and shook as he manipulated the handle.&nbsp; He sprayed more of his face and body 
than he did his mouth.&nbsp; But he received enough precious water to keep him alive, but for how much 
longer was questionable.&nbsp; Evan was deteriorating fast and would likely not survive another night in this 
place, especially if the weather conditions repeated themselves.&nbsp; And indeed, the forecast called for 
another day like the last, even perhaps hotter.&nbsp; No clouds were expected and the humidity was expected 
to be equally brutal.&nbsp; 
Evan had no idea how long he had been in isolation.&nbsp; He barely knew why he was there.&nbsp; By this point, 
his mind was playing tricks on him, creating images that weren�t there, sending him on hallucination 
fantasies that served to further confuse the line between reality and something else.&nbsp; Eventually, Evan 
started to cry and curled up in a ball and tried to will himself back to sleep.&nbsp; Eventually it worked and, for 
the final time, Evan fell unconscious in his own little hell.

The Scourging
The next morning, preparations were complete.&nbsp; Guests arrived between 7 and 8 a.m., went through a 
thorough screening process, signed waivers, had all electronic devices secured at check-in and they 
mingled, ate a light breakfast and started towards the bleachers at 8.&nbsp; The event itself was scheduled to 
commence at 8:30, but several people would first address those gathered.&nbsp; First among them was Evan�s 
father.
Dad confidently approached the podium that was outfitted with a microphone, which fed to a rented 
audio system.&nbsp; Speakers placed around the grounds assured everyone could hear and follow the 
proceedings.&nbsp; Three cameras and videographers commenced filming from various angles.&nbsp; He tapped on 
the microphone to ensure it was hot and proceeded.
Dad: �Thank you all so much for joining us for Evan�s destruction and rebirth.&nbsp; That�s right, destruction 
and rebirth.&nbsp; I wanted to start my comments with stark language so you are fully prepared for what you 
will witness today.&nbsp; Evan has offered his body, mind and soul for an event that will leave him forever 
changed.&nbsp; Today you will witness Evan�s scourging and crucifixion, in a way that as closely mirrors the 
trials faced by our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.&nbsp; My dear soon has prepared nearly a year for this day 
and he has created a scenario that faithfully resembles the brutality of what occurred 2000 years ago.�
Dad: �This may be hard for me to get out, so bear with me.&nbsp; Evan is determined to define himself as a 
person by walking the path of Jesus Chris.&nbsp; Many people do that by trying to live by the Ten 
Commandments, by spreading the word of the gospel or by a hundred other methods.&nbsp; Evan needs to 
walk this path in a manner that each of us is intimately familiar with.&nbsp; Jesus Chris was tortured, crucified 
and died on the cross for each of us.&nbsp; His sacrifice is the driving force behind every true Christian�s will.&nbsp; 
Evan needs to feel what Jesus felt.&nbsp; He has no delusions about being holier than anyone else, nor does 
he have any desire to have people follow him after today.&nbsp; Today will define Evan�s life and he will be 
reborn before our eyes.�
Dad: �In a few minutes, Evan will emerge from the barn (pointing) being led up the dirt path to the front 
of our small arena.&nbsp; Be warned that Evan will be nude.&nbsp; Once he reaches the center of the arena, we will 
secure him to the upright that is already placed before you.&nbsp; His loving brother, Matt, will be assuming 
the role of a Roman solider today and will perform all of the whippings.&nbsp; Roman history teaches us that 
40 whips equated to a sentence of death, so crucifixions were often accompanied by 39 lashes.&nbsp; That is 
what Evan will receive today.&nbsp; In real scenes, the soldiers would use Cat o� Nine tails with crushed bones 
attached to the ends of each tail.&nbsp; The bones would rip the condemned�s flesh, muscles and even 
damage bone.&nbsp; The damage done during this horrible ritual was permanent.&nbsp; We are modifying this 
tradition by using a Cat o� Nine tails with lead balls attached to the ends.&nbsp; This should just tear the skin 
and flesh, but leave the muscle and bones intact. �
Dad: �After Evan�s back is scourged, he will be attached to the upright and nails will be placed through 
his hands.&nbsp; We have conducted thorough research in this area and have identified devout people around 
the world who still perform crucifixions to this day and the subjects live to recreate the scene year after 
year.&nbsp; While we will avoid causing permanent damage, we will still hit nerves so the pain Evan will 
endure will be indescribable and authentic.&nbsp; We will then lift him and the upright onto the vertical beam, 
completing the cross.&nbsp; We will place Evan�s feet on slanted blocks leaving his knees bent.&nbsp; At no time will 
he be able to fully extend his legs.&nbsp; Then nails will be hammered into his feet.&nbsp; Finally, you will notice 
what may be the most humiliating part of today�s ceremony � the horn.&nbsp; The 12� by 2� wooden phallus 
is firmly attached to the upright and will tear and sodemize my son.�
There was dead silence and wide eyes among the crowd.&nbsp; Dad�s words permeated every soul in 
attendance and resonated with a power that was beyond words.&nbsp; Mouths went dry; many stopped 
blinking; some might as well have stopped breathing. But no one got up; no one left.&nbsp;&nbsp; At least for now, 
everyone was in this for the duration.
Dad: �Normally, the condemned would remain on the cross for 3-4 days, but we�re will limit this event 
to 24 hours at most.&nbsp; Making it the full 24 hours depends entirely on how Evan responds.&nbsp; We will both 
help and hinder him.&nbsp; We will help him by keeping IVs run into him with fluids ready to administer when 
needed.&nbsp; I have no intention of losing my son on the cross today.&nbsp; However, Evan�s stay up there will be 
challenging.&nbsp; Matt will also whip Evan�s front side to make up for the decreased time he will spend on 
the cross and the relatively minor impact of the nails.&nbsp; Finally, towards the end, we will perform a ritual 
many of you may not be aware of.&nbsp; We will use a metal pipe to break Evan�s lower legs.&nbsp; This brutal act 
will render him unable to push up and thus will hang solely by his wrists, amplifying his suffering.&nbsp; In 
historical contexts, the breaking of legs was performed to hasten death.&nbsp; We will do this with 1 hour 
remaining to complete the realism of the today�s event.�
Dad: �Evan�s goal, and all of ours involved today, is the same � to create a realistic environment that 
closely resembles what Jesus went through for each one of us.&nbsp; Evan knows what he�s getting into and 
he knows this will change him forever. There is a chance he could die today, but we have done and will 
do everything within our power to keep that risk to a minimum. �
Dad: �Okay, the time has come to bring Evan out.&nbsp; As we do, I will tell you about his ordeal so far.�&nbsp; 

Two hours before Evan�s father was at the podium introducing the crowd to today�s event, the Pastor 
and Doc Hendrix removed the padlock from the barn door and proceeded inside to the interior room.&nbsp; 
After removing the second padlock, they opened the door to be greeted by a smack of pungent, stale 
air.&nbsp; Both coughed a little at the smell.&nbsp; As light bathed the confined space, they saw Evan curled up in a 
ball, unconscious.&nbsp; Doc Hendrix quickly approached and felt for a pulse.&nbsp; He quickly felt a cool, wet wrist 
with a rapid, weak pulse.&nbsp; He tried to revive Evan but was successful in eliciting only a groan from our 
tragic hero.&nbsp; He told the Pastor that Evan needed fluids right away.&nbsp; 
The Pastor nodded his head in agreement and Doc Hendrix proceeded to run a line into Evan�s left arm 
and a second into his right arm.&nbsp; While only one would be used now, both might be used later.&nbsp; He ran a 
full bag of Lactated Ringer�s.&nbsp; Doc continued his assessment and cleaned up his young patient, who was 
dirty and had some feces stuck to himself.&nbsp; After an hour or so, Evan came around and was able to hold 
a conversation.&nbsp; He confirmed he knew where he was and why he was there.&nbsp; Most importantly, he 
affirmed his desire to go through with the crucifixion.&nbsp; He was weak, which was appropriate, as it would 
add to the realism of what was about to happen.&nbsp; As the hour approached, Doc and Pastor helped Evan 
to his feet where he walked around the interior of the barn to regain some muscle movement.
Pastor: �Okay Evan.&nbsp; The crowd had gathered outside and your father is telling them what�s going to 
happen today.&nbsp; In a few moments, it will begin and you won�t be able to back out, even when you 
scream and beg, which I�m sure you will do.�
Evan: �Please, no matter how much I beg, don�t give in.&nbsp; I have to see this through.&nbsp; I have to be fully 
broken so I can be reborn.�
Pastor smiled at young Evan�s conviction and was proud to see him embark on this journey of discovery 
through suffering.&nbsp; Doc Hendrix bound Evan�s wrists behind his back and led the freshly cleaned and 
naked Evan to the barn doors while Pastor waited just outside.

Dad motioned over to the Pastor who opened the barn doors and brought Doc Hendrix and Evan into 
view for the first time.&nbsp; The spectators twisted their heads and focused on the image in the distance.&nbsp; 
They could see 3 forms, one of whom was obviously naked.&nbsp; They watched as the three slowly 
approached and listened to Dad�s words.
Dad: �Evan�s ordeal did not begin today.&nbsp; Rather, it began 3 days ago when he was placed into a small 
locked room within the barn.&nbsp; There, my son had only water and his thoughts.&nbsp; I am also seeing him for 
the first time this morning and have no idea how he fared for the last 72 hours.&nbsp; I see his movements are 
slow and I imagine he�s very weak from his isolation.&nbsp; This portion, like everything you will see today, 
was Evan�s idea.&nbsp; The 72 hours of confinement allowed Evan to be mentally and physically weakened, 
simulating perhaps what Jesus might have endured through the trial and short confinement.&nbsp; 
Dad: �Evan has had nothing to eat in 3 days and will receive no food or water for the next 24 hours.&nbsp; It�s 
already hot this early morning and today�s forecast of 105 and humid will certainly add to his suffering.&nbsp; 
As I said before and you see, Evan is brought before us nude.&nbsp; Not only is this historically accurate, but 
it�s also humiliating for Evan to be before you so bare.�

For the first time in 3 days, Evan emerged from the barn, ready to face his ordeal with a determined 
mind.&nbsp; He was slightly delirious, he guessed from the lack of food for the past few days.&nbsp; Thinking back, 
he didn�t remember much about his time in the room, especially the last day.&nbsp; He knew it was hot; he 
knew he was hungry and he sweat a lot.&nbsp; What Evan didn�t know is that he lost 5 more pounds, mostly 
water weight, while in his self-imposed captivity.&nbsp; He emerged at 115 pounds, looking almost sickly as 
his sunken stomach and visible ribs defined the front side of his young body.&nbsp; To others, his hairless body 
will define him.&nbsp; To others still, his naked form will draw their stares.&nbsp; At this point, Evan wasn�t aware of 
his nudity (save the two needles in his arms), but focused exclusively on entering a state of mind that 
would allow him to endure what he knew was minutes away.
He slowly walked barefoot between the Pastor and Doc towards the arena where he saw a large crowd 
assembled.&nbsp; He looked down to avoid the uncomfortable stares.&nbsp; That honestly wasn�t difficult.&nbsp; He had 
spent so much time mentally preparing himself for today that it was easy to slip into a mental world 
occupied only by his thoughts.&nbsp; If he had been focused on the crowd, his teenage friends gathered here 
were the most aghast at what they saw.&nbsp; None of the girls or guys could believe Evan was actually going 
through with this and seeing him naked added an even greater level of disbelief.

Dad: �Pastor, Doc, thank you for being part of today�s ceremony.&nbsp; Please lead Evan to the post.�
As eyes stared at Evan�s thin, bare form, they saw two men leading him to the cross�s upright where 
Matt was already standing in wait.&nbsp; Evan�s and Matt�s eyes met briefly and just as quickly separated.&nbsp; 
Matt untied Evan�s bonds behind his back, secured his wrists together on his front side, raised them high 
up the post and nailed the rope into place.&nbsp; Matt tested the strength of the nailed rope and it wasn�t 
going anywhere.&nbsp; Evan�s body was stretched out vertically, requiring him to stand on his toes.&nbsp; Matt 
affixed more rope around the post and Evan�s knees, ankles, waist and neck.&nbsp; Matt whispered into 
Evan�s ears to struggle against the bonds and Evan complied.&nbsp; He showed the audience he was going 
nowhere.

Dad: �Evan is now secured in place and will receive 39 lashes at the hands of his brother Matthew.&nbsp; 
Matthew knows to play his part of Roman Soldier with resolve so prepare yourself for the brutality of 
this act.&nbsp; Matthew, if you please.�

Doc Hendrix and the Pastor walked away to near where Dad was standing by the podium, leaving Matt 
alone with Evan.&nbsp; Matt picked up his instrument of torture, ran his fingers through the tails, jiggled the 
lead balls and walked around the arena showing the crowd what would be used.&nbsp; Many gasped as they 
saw the lead balls on the end, holding their hands over their mouths in shock.&nbsp; Matt returned to the post 
and lined himself up a couple feet away from Evan�s backside.
Time slowed down for Evan as his thoughts filled with the joy and peace at his purification and the 
special journey that was about to begin.&nbsp; He pictured Jesus being strung up in a similar fashion (maybe 
not at the cross itself), about to receive his scourging.&nbsp; This gave him peace.&nbsp; But, in a blinding instant, 
that peace was interrupted by a white hot pain adorning his back.&nbsp; At first, he was so shocked he didn�t 
utter a word.&nbsp; But within mere moments, his lungs unleashed the most frightening scream anyone 
present had ever heard.&nbsp; It was accompanied by Evan�s thrashing against his inescapable bonds.&nbsp; The 
crowd gasped at the cruelty and fixated on the blood forming on his 17 year old pristine backside.&nbsp; Matt 
was taken aback by Evan�s reaction, but held firm and 10 seconds later, delivered another deadly blow 
just to the left of the first on his upper back.&nbsp; Again, Evan unleashed a blood curdling scream that could 
wake the dead.&nbsp; Accompanying the scream was a bit of crying and hysterical grunts.&nbsp; But no begging to 
stop.
Over the next several minutes, Matt tore into Evan�s back, never relenting, never letting up.&nbsp; By the 20th 
stroke, Evan�s back was a bloody, torn up mess and Matt�s entire arm and some of his shirt was covered 
in his brother�s blood splatter.&nbsp; The metal balls were doing their job by tearing into his helpless skin.&nbsp; 
They also bruised Evan�s bones from the sheer force of impact.
By the 30th stroke, Evan was beyond screaming and instead was starting to blabber his cries.&nbsp; His body 
jerked with each blow and Matt knew his steadfast dedication would result in a backside that would 
never fully heal.
The crowd shuttered with each blow; some women covered their eyes and others cried in horror and 
pity.&nbsp; Others stood and passionately called for mercy.&nbsp; Others openly prayed to Jesus.&nbsp; No mercy and no 
compassion came Evan�s way.&nbsp; He suffered like no person should have to suffer.&nbsp; By the 39th blow, Evan 
was barely conscious.&nbsp; His already weakened state was amplified by the torture and he had almost 
nothing left to give.&nbsp; He slouched in his bonds and made no effort to hold himself upright.&nbsp; Dead weight 
hung by his wrists from the upright.&nbsp; To look closely at his back was to look upon a mangled scene of 
torn skin, mangled flesh and streams of blood.&nbsp; To die during a real scourging in ancient times must have 
been a blessing.&nbsp; 
Doc Hendrix approached Evan and attended to his injuries.&nbsp; He removed the bonds holding him to the 
post, but left the wrist restraints in place.&nbsp; He liberally applied water, then antiseptic and antibiotic 
treatments to his torn backside in hopes of staving off infection.&nbsp; Once complete, he performed an 
assessment and found Evan again barely conscious.&nbsp; He left him hanging on the post and conferred with 
Dad privately at the podium.
Doc: �He needs more fluids.&nbsp; His body is so weak that it just can�t take the beating a well-built guy could.&nbsp; 
This might have been too brutal for him.&nbsp; He could die from this alone.�
Dad: �Well, we�re not stopping now, so do what you have to do.�
Doc approached Evan, let him down on the ground and proceeded to run another bag of fluids into the 
previously-established lines.
Dad spoke to the crowd: �As you can see, the scourging is a brutal spectacle, one which many did not 
survive.&nbsp; Evan is alive but weak.&nbsp; Doc Hendrix is giving him some fluids to replenish what he�s lost and to 
also provide him with some strength so he can endure the even greater trails that await him.&nbsp; As you 
might expect, his back will never fully heal and he will carry these scars for the rest of his life.&nbsp; If you 
know anything about Evan, he will them scars with pride.&nbsp; He won�t hide behind them.&nbsp; So please do not 
pity him.&nbsp; Instead, celebrate his courage and sacrifice.�
Dad continued: �While Evan is recovering, my son and others are preparing for the main event.&nbsp; They 
have brought the wooden cross beam to the center of the arena where you will shortly witness the 
nailing.&nbsp; Ladders are also being placed on either side of the upright to life Evan onto the post.&nbsp; Finally, 
you see that the horn is being affixed to the upright.�
Over the next 30 minutes, the crowd watched Evan slowly recover his strength and color.&nbsp; They 
whispered among themselves at how brutal the scourging was and how it�s amazing he survived.&nbsp; Some 
hinted it might be divine intervention that kept him alive.&nbsp; Others were still drawn to Evan�s naked body, 
which now glistened with sweat as it lay face down on the well-manicured grass.&nbsp; But most were 
emblazoning the image of Evan�s raw back into their memories.&nbsp; The doctor placed no bandages on his 
wounds so the torn mass that was once his pristine back was truly a sight to behold.&nbsp; The bleeding had 
stopped, but the damage was done.&nbsp; How their Lord survived such an ordeal is a thought to behold.
When Evan came around, the first thing that entered his mind was the unbelievable agony he felt on his 
back.&nbsp; No words could describe the fire that burned through his body.&nbsp; He didn�t scream or yell, but he 
quickly discovered that changing position to find comfort was ill advised.&nbsp; Any movement caused an 
amplification of his suffering.&nbsp; Evan scanned the crowd as he lay prone in the arena and saw hundreds of 
eyes fixated on him.&nbsp; Normally, a boy of his age would be embarrassed that so many people were staring 
at his nakedness, but Evan felt pride that they were witnessing his transformation.&nbsp; He gained mental 
strength when he saw his friends clutching each other and eventually managed to sit up.
Almost as if watching an injured football player sit up on the field, the crowd erupted into applause and 
encouragement as Evan rose.&nbsp; The crowd�s enthusiasm gave him the last bit of strength he needed to 
mostly blank out the agony he felt and deliver an affirmative nod to his father and the crowd.
Dad speaks to the crowd: �Evan is an amazing young man, isn�t he?&nbsp; It�s hard to hold back tears as he 
continues to inspire us.&nbsp; I imagine Jesus Christ had the same strength to dampen the worrying of those 
who witnessed his final hours.&nbsp; I�m going to change the script somewhat and before we proceed with 
the crucifixion, I will ask Evan to rise and walk around the arena, in front of the bleachers, so you can see 
the remarkable person who is sacrificing so much to gain even more.�
Dad continues: �Evan, can you stand?�
Evan, flanked by the Doc, placed his hands upon the ground and slowly pushed himself upright.&nbsp; Doc 
held Evan�s arm to steady him and, when Evan was ready, released his arm.&nbsp; Evan was shaky, but able to 
stand on his own.&nbsp; 
Dad: �Good.&nbsp; Walk to the first stand, let them see you front and back, and make your way around the 
arena.�
Evan proceeded as instructed and visited the stands where the crowds� eyes are as big as ever, eager to 
take in the sights in front of them.&nbsp; Some were too overcome to look at his back as he turned around, 
but most absorbed the horrible visuals, allowing their minds to drift back some 2000 years.&nbsp; Those 
people were awe inspired to be part of such vivid history.&nbsp; When Evan faced the crowd, it was hard for 
many not to catch a glance or even stare at his nude maleness.&nbsp; His teenage friends had a hard time 
processing the overwhelming visuals (both front and back) from their friend.&nbsp; They collectively remained 
in stunned silence at what they were witnessing.
After several minutes, Evan concluded his one-person parade and returned to the center of the arena 
where Matt waited.&nbsp; Evan looked down at the cross and assembled tools, knowing what was about to 
take place.&nbsp; After a slow, long inhale, Evan exhaled and nodded to Matt.
The Crucifixion
Dad: �Ladies and gentlemen, the crucifixion is set to begin.&nbsp; There is no turning back.&nbsp; My son will hang 
from the cross just as our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ did two millennia ago.&nbsp; Matt will once again take 
the lead in performing the ritual on his younger brother.&nbsp; Evan�s bravery is an inspiration to us all and I 
now ask for complete silence so we can each take in the sounds that await us.&nbsp; First, of course, must 
come the crown of thorns, or more accurately a crown of barbed wire.�
Matt took his cue to begin and retrieved the crown from his mother, who most expertly and carefully 
created it.&nbsp; The three rings of barbed wire were interwoven with sturdy greens from the area and it was 
a beautiful sight to behold.&nbsp; As if presenting and setting a crown on a king, Matt slowly raised the crown 
of sharp spiked wire above his brother�s head and gently set it atop his scalp.&nbsp; Looking around the 
crown, he saw that at least 8 barbs had their pointy edges resting on his head.&nbsp; Matt, satisfied with the 
placement, pushed the crown into his brother�s head, mashing each point into the skin causing instant 
bleeding from the puncture site.&nbsp; He managed to get all 8 barbs to seat in Evan�s head, resulting in 8 
trickles of blood down his head and face.&nbsp; The visual is absolutely stunning and while not horribly painful 
for Evan, made him look perfect for the next act.
Matt motions Evan to lie down, on the grass, on his back.&nbsp; Matt helped his groaning brother into place, 
as the fresh contact on his back renewed his suffering.&nbsp; Evan lied uncomfortably with most of his body 
on the ground and his shoulder blade perched atop the 6�x6� wooden beam.&nbsp; He slowly stretched out 
both of his arms, palms up, across the 7� wide beam.&nbsp; Matt had pre-arranged the rope and began to tie 
Evan�s wrists tightly to the beam.&nbsp; Contrary to a real crucifixion where the weight would be borne by the 
nails, in this crucifixion, the weight would be split between the rope and the nails.&nbsp; When completed 
with Evan�s left wrist, he proceeded to the right wrist, testing the rope to his satisfaction.
Matt next gathered the hammer and nails.
Dad addressed the crowd: �As I described earlier, we will nail my son to the Cross, but not in exactly the 
same manner as was performed in Roman times.&nbsp; Then, a single large nail would be hammered through 
each wrist which would eventually bear the condemned�s entire weight.&nbsp; The suffering was beyond 
imagination and death was assured.&nbsp; Through research into cultures that perform simulated annual 
crucifixions to this day, we know that a nail placed through the palm of the hand is very painful, but not 
fatal.&nbsp; Matt has secured Evan�s wrists so they will bear most of the weight and not the nails.&nbsp; Matt will 
now deliver the first nail.� 
Matt knelt into position, placed the 2� long nail with large, flat head atop the exact spot that had been 
prescribed by research to minimize damage.&nbsp; He gripped the hammer in his right hand and snuck at 
glance at Evan.&nbsp; Evan, for his part, stared straight up into the clouds, lost in a trance of solitude, barely 
aware of the agony that awaited him.&nbsp; Matt looked back at his target, raised the hammer into the air 
and brought it down with blinding speed onto its target.&nbsp; In an instant, the nail descended through the 
palm of the hand and halfway into the wooden cross.&nbsp; A guttural scream escaped Evan�s mouth as he 
instinctively tried to recoil his hand.&nbsp; Matt managed to ignore the scream and drove home the nail the 
rest of the way until the large head lay flush against the palm.
Scores of audience members screamed in terror along with Evan, some out of sheer fright, some 
because they reached a spiritual bliss unmatched in their lives.&nbsp; Each person�s reaction was unique, but 
the sheer power of the moment was shared by all.&nbsp; Evan was in true agony as trickles of blood escaped 
the wound sight.&nbsp; Satisfied with his work, Matt moved to the other hand and unceremoniously drove the 
second nail into its helpless target.&nbsp; Again, Evan screamed in terror, breaking out into an even greater 
sweat than he was already in.&nbsp; The pain in his back had somehow disappeared and his whole world 
focused on the unbearable agony of his impaled hands, which he could neither move nor protect.&nbsp; No 
thoughts of Jesus for him at this moment; only thoughts of suffering.
When Evan was secured to the crossbeam, Matt motioned for several helpers to come forward.&nbsp; Two 
people lined up on each side of the cross and carefully transported their victim to the upright.&nbsp; Dad 
described to the crowd what was happening, but people knew and many tuned out his voice, instead 
focusing on the unbelievable sight of young Evan, or was it really Jesus?
The men slowly ascended the ladders and lifted the 150 pound crossbeam and its 115 pound captor 
entirely off the ground onto the upright.&nbsp; Several things happened at once.&nbsp; First, Evan stretched out 
with nearly all of his body�s weight being held by his lashed wrists and some by his nailed hands.&nbsp; This 
elicited new screams and new tortures upon his young body.&nbsp; In his present position, the horn was 
behind Evan so two of the men grabbed hold of his sides and lifted his body upward and backwards, 
positioning him so the horn where it would fulfill its destiny.&nbsp; They parted his cheeks to ensure perfect 
placement of the tapered horn at the entrance of his virgin hole.&nbsp; Now, 100% of Evan�s weight was 
resting most uncomfortably on his hole.
The horn was 12� long and 2� wide, tapered at the end to aide in insertion.&nbsp; At Evan�s insistence during 
planning, the horn was left mostly natural and retained the knots and splinters of the roughly cut and 
shaped phallus of torture.&nbsp; As with everything else in this event, the horn was designed to maximize 
humiliation and suffering.
As Evan�s hole slowly opened to accommodate its impending violator, the men secured his feet in place 
for their nailing.&nbsp; The foot wrests were carefully constructed and positioned to achieve two objectives.&nbsp; 
One foot rest was located on each side of the upright.&nbsp; To ensure he could not stand all the way up, the 
rests themselves were sloped downwards at a 45 degree angle.&nbsp; Finally, to ensure his legs were spread 
wide and not bunched together, each downward foot slope was constructed to face outward, again at a 
45 degree angle.&nbsp; So, Evan�s right foot was uncomfortably facing down and out to its right, while his left 
foot was similarly facing down and out towards the left side of his body.&nbsp; This left Evan�s mid-section and 
groin on total display for the audience.&nbsp; The clever design also would greatly aide in his suffering over 
the coming hours.
As two men steadied Evan�s right foot, Matt placed a 2�x2� thin piece of wood with a pre-drilled hole 
over the top of his brother�s foot.&nbsp; With the struggling sure to come, the small piece of wood should help 
keep the nails in place.&nbsp; He lined the small hole directly over the place where the 4� nail would be 
driven.&nbsp; The location was located about 1� between the crease of his big toe and second toe, chosen to 
miss bones.&nbsp; While pain would be ever-present through the event, permanent injury should not occur.
Matt looked at his father for approval to begin and receiving a nod, Matt raised the hammer and 
expertly drove the nail completely through the foot and slightly into the wooden rest.&nbsp; Evan screamed 
anew and struggled in even more desperation to avoid the white hot pain his body was suffering.&nbsp; Matt 
kept hammering and Evan kept suffering.&nbsp; While struggling, Evan unwittingly rubbed his vulnerable back 
on the upright, aggravating the previous injuries, renewing his bleeding.&nbsp; His full-body suffering reached 
levels that no one could endure.&nbsp; Yet his destruction was far from over.&nbsp; Matt turned his focus to the left 
foot and repeated the brutal nailing, completing Evan�s crucifixion.&nbsp; He and the men backed away and 
the crowd got their first unobstructed view of their young hero, covered from head to toe in white hot 
pain.
Only a couple minutes into his crucifixion, Evan struggled and screamed with all his might.&nbsp; He quickly 
transitioned from holding all his weight by his wrists to attempting to prop himself up on his feet.&nbsp; Either 
choice resulted in its own brand of agony.&nbsp; Attempting to stand caused his hands and feet to shift; Evan 
knew he was tearing his precious appendages to shreds.&nbsp; Every time he descended, the horn made 
further entry into his anus.&nbsp; The only thing going for Evan was that, this point, no weight was being held 
by his wrists.
The crowd witnessed a truly horrifying and inspiring sight.&nbsp; Before them hung a naked boy who endured 
near-death tortures and now endured a constant insult that was beyond words.&nbsp; Blood ran from his 
head, all 4 nail wounds and, within 10 minutes of up and down struggling, blood finally started to run 
down the inside of his thighs and down his freshly-torn back.&nbsp; As the minutes past and the constant 
screams of agony flowed freely through the arena, Evan sank further and further onto the horn.&nbsp; His 
hole was not only being torn, but he was being rhythmically violated deeper and deeper.&nbsp; Pre-planning 
saw Evan and his father take exacting measurements to ensure that if Evan sank 11� onto the horn, all of 
his body�s weight would be on his wrists.&nbsp; Being i 11� deep inside a virgin hole is not something either 
was sure he could endure.&nbsp; During this slow, systematic anal impaling, splinters separated from the horn 
and embedded themselves inside his inner flesh and knots ensured continual scraping.
No matter what happened on the cross, Evan would be in a constant state of horrific pain from multiple 
sources.&nbsp; There was no escaping his destiny now.&nbsp; He would suffer and maybe (hopefully?) die on the 
cross.&nbsp; If he managed to survive, he would awaken a unique man.
The Day of Suffering
Evan�s body was a sight to behold.&nbsp; He hung on the Cross with a bloody crown atop his head, his arms 
spread wide, blood trickling from the nail holes, his ribs stretched and his stomach sunken from his 
body�s position, his legs bent at the knees and spread inescapably wide, his anus constantly violated by 
an unrelenting wooden phallus and his feet bleeding from their impaling.&nbsp; To add to his discomfort, 
cramps entered his thighs and he struggled to relieve the pain that would not escape him.&nbsp; There was 
not a dry eye in the place.&nbsp; Even teenage guys cried at the sight of their friend suffering and slowly dying 
before their eyes.&nbsp; Everyone knew Evan was doing this for himself, but many convinced themselves he 
was Jesus reborn and was about to die for their sins.
His body was covered in a sheet of sweat, not only from the 100 degree heat by mid-day, but also 
because of his body�s attempted to cool itself from the internal heat being generated by compensating 
for the cruel treatment.&nbsp; There was no position that offered even the slightest bit of comfort.&nbsp; And Evan 
tried every position available to him.&nbsp; No matter what he did, he was assaulted by blinding pain that 
would not let up in the least.&nbsp; He could concentrate on nothing but nerve impulses being fed to his brain.&nbsp; 
At one point he peed himself but he was completely unaware of it.&nbsp; The crowd notice, of course, and 
whispered among themselves at the sad sight.&nbsp; He cried and moaned constantly as he shook his head 
from side to side, wrapped in a cocoon of unrelenting torture.

At one point, Evan�s mind convinced him to open his eyes where he saw a blur of white light with no 
detail.&nbsp; He wondered if he was in Heaven, or at least at Heaven�s doorstep.&nbsp; Slowly, shadows emerged 
and floated in midair.&nbsp; Long-past relatives he imagined.&nbsp; Surrounding the smoke-colored forms were 
what appeared to be leaves on trees gently blowing back and forth.&nbsp; The image was peaceful and for just 
a moment, Evan�s subconscious mind managed to subdue his conscious mind and he found the first bit 
of calm since this ordeal began.&nbsp; As the moments ticked by, however, the floating forms morphed into 
real people sitting in bleachers and the gentle breeze turned into the haze of this very hot and humid 
day.
As Evan focus matured, he slowly scanned himself.&nbsp; He was really here.&nbsp; It was really happening.&nbsp; He was 
fully crucified, bleeding, tortured and experiencing what he had longed for.&nbsp; He saw the condition of his 
body and he knew deep down he regretted none of it.&nbsp; His eyes turned to the crowd where he met his 
eyes with short glances at each person who would hold his view.&nbsp; He somehow managed to think of the 
pride and gratitude he felt that so many were witnessing his destruction.&nbsp; This mental focus lasted 
maybe 10 seconds, when his nerve messages resumed as the dominant force in Evan�s mind.&nbsp; He was 
snapped back to reality, acutely aware of every point of pain that attacked his vulnerable form.

The crowd was overcome by feelings of remorse and sympathy for the creature that suffered 
unrelenting agonies in front of them.&nbsp; Only two hours in and many were crying and begging for him to be 
released.&nbsp; Matt, his parents and sister, sat together in silence, holding each other�s hands fixated on the 
courage they saw before them.&nbsp; They knew this is everything Evan wanted and while he was hurting so 
much and in such uncontrollable distress, none of them broke form.&nbsp; Two people (one middle aged 
female and one elderly female) had enough and left, shouting in the direction of the host family that 
they are despicable people for torturing their son to death.&nbsp; Clearly, these women had no idea why we 
were here.&nbsp; Everyone else stayed and endured the violent sights and sounds from the center of the 
arena.
As the third hour commenced, one member of the crowd descended the bleachers and approached the 
cross, kneeling down to pray before him.&nbsp; This act started a trend and over the next 2 hours, half the 
crowd took their turn before the tortured form.&nbsp; All along, Evan cried, struggled and finally started to 
beg to be let down.&nbsp; The begging started off muted with cries of �Please help me� and �I can�t take this 
anymore� as person after person lined up before him.&nbsp; This led to widespread crying in the crowd as this 
helpless naked form begged for mercy.
Dad arose and approached the microphone: �It�s been nearly 5 hours since my son has been placed 
upon the cross.�&nbsp; The crowd quieted down and listened.&nbsp; �He has shown tremendous courage given the 
worst suffering a human being can suffer.&nbsp; But, everyone reaches their breaking point and it seems Evan 
is approaching his.&nbsp; You must know that we, as a family, talked about this eventuality at length.&nbsp; Evan 
made us promise and even swear before God, that when he did beg, we would not relent.&nbsp; He needed 
more than anything to endure beyond what he could endure, to suffer more than humanly possible, to 
experience full destruction.&nbsp; So, that�s what we�re going to do.&nbsp; We�re going to honor his request and 
continue with the crucifixion.&nbsp; In fact, we�re going to proceed with the next step and Matt will perform 
the second half of the scourging.&nbsp; I know this will be horrible to watch, but it�s what he wants � it�s what 
he needs.&nbsp; Matt?�
Matt got up, parted ways from his family�s clutches and proceeded to his young brother�s frail form.&nbsp; 
The view from so close was close to grotesque.&nbsp; His naked body looked so abused, so helpless.&nbsp; Fresh 
blood trickled every time he struggled, which has significantly subsided by now.&nbsp; He had expended 
almost all of his energy.&nbsp; His anus had been completely torn to shreds and violated to the full 11� 
allowed by his hanging wrists.&nbsp; If his body would have allowed the 12th inch, he would have taken it.&nbsp; 
Matt caught sight of Evan�s eyes and saw into a broken and defeated soul.&nbsp; He was so vulnerable and 
was about to endure yet another horrendous assault on his body.&nbsp; 
He knew he was to deliver 39 strokes of the same whip to his front side.&nbsp; His practice reinforced the 
necessity to stay away from Evan�s face and he would have to be on guard for the unexpected times 
when Evan would drop his head to his chest in sheer exhaustion or if he passed out.&nbsp; Since he was raised 
in the air a few feet, it would make Matt�s job easier to whip the chest and stomach.&nbsp; Matt examined 
every inch of his little brother�s perfect torso.&nbsp; His chest was so smooth, no hair ever present in his 
young life.&nbsp; His ribs were clearly visible and he knew they would bruise from the forthcoming beating.&nbsp; 
His small undefined nipples were flat against his chest.&nbsp; Moving down, his stomach was sunken from his 
slim weight and his little innie belly button was flush with his skin.&nbsp; Moving further down, Matt couldn�t 
help but look at his brother�s penis and testicles, resting helplessly amid widely stretched legs.&nbsp; 
Everything about Evan was so beautiful, so perfect.&nbsp; He was about to be ruined forever.
In clear violation of the plan, he spoke to his brother.
Matt: �Evan, I�m so sorry to have to do this, but I�m going to beat your front side.�
Evan tried to reply but had no voice left.&nbsp; His screaming and dry throat robbed him of it.&nbsp; So, he 
whispered instead.&nbsp; Matt leaned in. �I .. know Matt.&nbsp; I hurt � so bad .. and I so.. weak�
A tear formed and slid down Matt�s right cheek.&nbsp; �I�ll stop this whole thing if you ask me.�
Evan whispered again: �No .. you can�t.&nbsp; I have .. to...&nbsp; please � beat me � as hard as you .. can�
Matt couldn�t believe what he was hearing.&nbsp; How could his brother have such unbelievable courage so 
many hours into being hung on the cross?&nbsp; How in the world was this possible?&nbsp; Matt truly began to 
believe that the Hand of God was touching his brother today, empowering him with the will to endure.&nbsp; 
This, in turn, gave Matt the strength to do his part.
Matt: �I love you Evan.&nbsp; You�re an inspiration to me.&nbsp; I promise I will hurt you as bad as I can and you will 
inspire us all by your will to be reborn.�
Evan squeaked: �Thank you � brother.�
Matt backed up, grasped the cat o� nine tails with sewn-in lead balls, gave his father a nod indicating he 
was ready and took position in front of his target.&nbsp; Evan tried to hold his head high, his body helplessly 
spread wide, unable to do anything to protect or minimize the torture that awaits him.&nbsp; He looked upon 
a crowd that held its collective breath and hands covering mouths in horrid anticipation.
The first blow was devastating.&nbsp; It hit Evan mid-chest and everyone could hear the sound of metal balls 
striking bony ribs.&nbsp; That sound was terrorizing and the affects were immediate.&nbsp; Matt watched before his 
eyes as cuts formed, turned red and released blood in slow trickles.&nbsp; Evan, despite his almost ruined 
voice, managed a blood curdling scream and full body contortion, which aggravated every existing 
injury.&nbsp; The assault was too much for Evan and he flailed for several seconds, screaming uncontrollably 
along the way.&nbsp; The crowd collectively gasped at the horror of his reaction.&nbsp; Matt stood in stunned 
silence as his brother reached a new level of self-destruction.&nbsp; In the longest 15 seconds of his life, Matt 
was paralyzed and unable to move until, at last, Evan calmed down.&nbsp; 
Matt gathered his courage, knew his duty and delivered another strike upon his defenseless brother, 
landing in nearly the same place.&nbsp; Again, Evan�s reaction was to scream and buck against his bonds.&nbsp; 
Every 15 seconds or so for the next several minutes, Matt permanently destroyed the front of his 
brother�s body.&nbsp; Flesh tore open, blood flowed freely, ribs were bruised and Evan shook uncontrollably 
with each strike.&nbsp; Matt relented.&nbsp; He was determined to give Evan�s brother what he needed.&nbsp; By the 30th 
strike, Evan barely responded.&nbsp; His head lay against his chest and his breathing was shallow and rapid.&nbsp; 
Matt misinterpreted the signs and figured he should ramp up the torture to get reactions like he saw 
earlier.&nbsp; Matt stood back and looked over the mess of torn flesh on Evan�s chest and stomach and then 
looked a little further south.&nbsp; He had an idea how to get the reaction Evan would want.
For the next blow, Matt carefully aimed and delivered a full force strike right to Evan�s groin, striking his 
oh so sensitive parts dead on in the process.&nbsp; Evan was out of it and was totally unaware this assault was 
coming.&nbsp; When it happened, his eyes flew open and he threw up all over himself and turned as white as 
a sheet.&nbsp; He howled and screamed as he never did before.&nbsp; He almost managed to rip his right hand free 
of the nail as he thrashed about.
The crowd gasped in collective agony at what they witnessed Matt do and one lady passed out from the 
horror of it.&nbsp; Matt�s dad ran up to him and ripped the whip from his hand.&nbsp; Dad looked at Evan�s crotch 
and saw his penis bleeding and angry purple spots start to form on his son�s testicles. 
Dad yelled at his son: �What were you thinking!?!�
Matt calmly replied: �It�s what Evan wants.&nbsp; He whispered to me before I started that even in his state 
he wanted me to beat him as bad as possible.�
Dad continued to yell: �including castrating him?!?�
Matt: �He will be fine.&nbsp; He needs to suffer and he is.&nbsp; Now hand me the whip.&nbsp; He has 8 more coming to 
him.�
Dad: �Not if you�re going to hit him there again.&nbsp; No way.�
Matt: �Dad, this is my responsibility.&nbsp; But I will make you a deal.&nbsp; Seven more on his body and the last 
one will be on his crotch.�
Dad: �No way.&nbsp; It�s not happening.�
Matt looked deeply and seriously into his father�s eyes: �Yes, dad, it is.&nbsp; Now hand me the whip and let 
me do my job.�
Dad met his son�s stare.&nbsp; He had never seen Matt so focused, so determined. He thought for several 
seconds as Matt offered no further words.&nbsp; He was serious wasn�t he?&nbsp; Dad relented and slowly handed 
the whip back to his son and walked to his seat beside his wife and Mary, whom he had to comfort.&nbsp; 
Mary covered her eyes in fear; she couldn�t see her big brother like this.&nbsp; Evan�s mother begged dad to 
go back out there and intervene.&nbsp; He said nothing and let his eldest son continue.
Matt delivered seven more whippings to Evan�s already ruined body, adding to the scars he would 
forever carry.&nbsp; Only dad and Matt knew what was coming for the final blow, as the crowd by now 
assumed dad had talked Matt out of any more brutal blows to Evan�s crotch.&nbsp; But Matt knew this final 
strike would be truly devastating and might ruin his brother�s chance for reproduction.&nbsp; But he was 
consumed with following through on hurting him as bad as possible.&nbsp; This was the only way he knew 
how.
Matt lined up again, reared back and delivered the most forceful strike of the day, landing dead on 
target, with all of the leather straps and metal balls finding the soft targets of Evan�s vulnerable 
maleness.&nbsp; As before Evan reacted immediately and violently.&nbsp; This time he managed to push himself all 
the way up, almost completely removing the horn from his hole.&nbsp; What the crowd saw next horrified 
them.&nbsp; Evan expelled brown liquid from his hole that oozed around the horn while he simultaneously 
threw up with little bile he had left in his stomach.&nbsp; He completely evacuated himself while thrashing 
about on the cross.&nbsp; None of the nails came loose but some minor internal tearing had to have occurred. 
He desperately attempted to close his legs in some vane, instinctual attempt to protect his sex.&nbsp; His 
thrashing was so violent and his screams so horrific that it�s a wonder he didn�t die from sheer terror.&nbsp; 
It took Evan a couple minutes to slump back down, completely spent.&nbsp; He had nothing left in him to give.&nbsp; 
He sagged completely on the horn, hanging by his wrists, feces and blood covering the entire inside of 
his legs as the vile mixture ran down his lower body.&nbsp; Matt inspected his work and saw that in addition 
to fresh cuts and bleeding in his brother�s penis, his testicles swelled almost before his eyes.&nbsp; He even 
saw where his right testicle and been torn and was actively bleeding.&nbsp; He did his job.&nbsp; 
A couple dozen more people, having witnessed this, could no longer stand to stay.&nbsp; They got up and ran 
out, taking off in their vehicles, never to return.&nbsp; Their memories would forever be scarred.&nbsp; The doc ran 
up to Evan, eager to tend to his wounds.&nbsp; He cleaned the numerous cuts in Evan�s chest and stomach, 
again applying antiseptics and other concoctions aimed at controlling bleeding and preventing infection.&nbsp; 
He knew Evan would need stiches when this was done.&nbsp; He manipulated Evan�s sexual organs, checking 
for permanent injury.&nbsp; Fortunately, neither of his testicles appeared burst, but they would be swollen 
and in pain for some time.&nbsp; Evan was passed out and upon checking vitals, Doc immediately 
administered another two bags of fluids.
By this time in the late afternoon, the temperature soared to 103 degrees and the humidity stifled 
breathing.&nbsp; Evan was struggling to stay alive and Doc told his dad that he was on the edge of death.&nbsp; His 
body might not survive the current injuries and certainly wouldn�t be able to endure any more.&nbsp; Even if 
he comes around with the fluids, he won�t have the strength to hold himself.&nbsp; That meant he would 
perpetually hang exclusively by his wrists and that would start to compromise his breathing.&nbsp; Evan 
thought he was at Heaven�s doorstep a short time ago; in reality he was standing at Death�s doorstep.
While Doc was stabilizing Evan, the crowd got its first real break and was gathered in a nearby part of 
the property to eat from a large BBQ meal that specially-selected guests had been preparing.&nbsp; The only 
people with Evan were his family and Doc.&nbsp; They were free to talk openly.&nbsp; 
Matt: �I�m not sorry I hurt Evan so bad.&nbsp; We all know it�s what he�s been begging for this.�
Mom: �I know son.&nbsp; It�s just so hard to see him hanging up there, almost dead.&nbsp; I mean look at him.&nbsp; He 
looks worse than I ever imagined.�
The whole family looked at their ruined son hanging before them.&nbsp; He was still out cold.&nbsp; On any other 
day, the red, sun-burned skinned that also covered Evan�s exposed body would be an insult in its own 
right.&nbsp; Now, it was dismissed.
Mary cried: �Please, we have to take him down.&nbsp; He�s going to die.�
Dad: �Evan is strong my dear Mary.&nbsp; He wants to be taken to the edge and that�s right where he is --- 
hovering on the edge of this world and the next.&nbsp; Who knows, he might be peeking into Heaven right 
now, seeing the beauty that awaits someone clearly as worthy as him.�
Matt: �He is the strongest person I�ve ever met.&nbsp; We owe him.�
Doc: �Let�s see if the fluids bring him back to a level where he can continue.�
The family agreed.&nbsp; They also ate, leaving Evan alone to hang on the cross by himself.

The Finale
At about 7 p.m., everyone reconvened on the bleachers, leaving about 2 hours until sunset.&nbsp; The 
temperature hovered in the upper 90s and the humidity remained ever present.&nbsp; Many of the younger 
guys in the crowd had removed their shirts and the women were fanning themselves with whatever was 
present.&nbsp; Evan had come around but was barely conscious.&nbsp; As he gazed the crowd, his eyes were empty.&nbsp; 
His head movements were erratic and he made no deliberate eye contact with anyone.&nbsp; His body was a 
horrible mess.&nbsp; Below his head and above his knees, you could barely tell there was a young man�s torso.&nbsp; 
It has been ripped to shreds by the second scourging.&nbsp; Almost no one could survive 78 devastating 
whippings, in addition to the assaults of being starved for days and being crucified.&nbsp; But Evan had done 
such an amazing such conditioning his body, mind and soul for this experience.
During the break in the action, Doc and the family had a long discussion and agreed to a modified plan.&nbsp; 
Dad approached the podium once again.&nbsp; Filming resumed.
Dad: �Evan has been crucified for 10 hours, nearly halfway to his goal of 24 hours.&nbsp; During these 10 
hours, he has been tortured as planned.&nbsp; While a couple of the specific tortures were more brutal than 
had been planned, it seemed Evan would have welcomed them if it enhanced his suffering.&nbsp; As you 
know, my son wants nothing more than to have an experience that very closely approximates what 
Jesus Chris endured.&nbsp; I now believe we have done a good job of giving Evan an experience that will allow 
him to be reborn, just as he wants.�
Dad: �While Evan is alive and with us now, Dr. Hendrix does not believe Evan will survive the night, even 
if we expose him to no further torments.&nbsp; This is obviously unacceptable so we have altered the plan.&nbsp; As 
you know, Evan planned for one final torture to be performed on him � breaking his lower legs.&nbsp; The 
purpose of this activity is to deny the condemned the ability to raise himself up to relieve pressure from 
his wrists.&nbsp; As you can see, that has already happened.&nbsp; Evan is hanging from his writs and he will soon 
succumb to the internal pressures in his chest and he will stop breathing.&nbsp; You can also see that he is 
completely impaled on the horn.�
Dad: �So, rather than extend the processions into the overnight and reconvene with you tomorrow 
morning, we are going to conclude this event now.&nbsp; Before we let Evan down, however, we are going to 
grant him his last wish and break his legs.&nbsp; The effects won�t be the same, but the family agrees that he 
will feel the day was incomplete if he does not experience this final insult.&nbsp; He will also want to fully 
experience the prolonged rehabilitation that will come with learning to walk again.&nbsp; It�s all part of his 
rebirth.&nbsp; So, Matt will now proceed and in one hour we will free my son.&nbsp; After Matt breaks Evan�s legs, I 
will invite each of you to approach my son hanging on the cross, touch his body and return to your seat.�
Matt approached his brother and even though he looked horrendous, he looked better than when he 
last saw him.&nbsp; The doc cleaned up the obvious blood and feces that adorned the exterior of his body and 
all of the bleeding ceased.&nbsp; The most visible and scary part of looking at Evan were the deep cuts in his 
torso, his purple penis and his bloated, bruised testicles, especially the right one.&nbsp; He looked at Evan, but 
saw vast emptiness in his eyes.&nbsp; He wasn�t sure Evan knew what was about to happen, but he told him 
anyway.&nbsp; Evan gave no response.
In his right hand, Matt held a one-inch thick, three-foot long piece of hollow, cylindrical pipe.&nbsp; This 
sturdy, heavy and unforgiving instrument would certainly do the trick of fracturing the tibia and fibula.&nbsp; 
In ancient times, this must have been an unbelievably horrible assault on a body that was already so 
close to death.&nbsp; 
Matt started with his brother�s outstretched left leg, taking several practice swings, aiming at mid leg 
each time.&nbsp; He reared back, took a deep breath and swung with all his might.&nbsp; The last thing he wanted 
to do was deliver an insufficient blow that he would have to repeat.&nbsp; The sound was absolutely 
horrifying to the crowd.&nbsp; It sounded like a car crash as the unforgiving metal impacted its target with no 
consideration for the damage it was about to cause.&nbsp; The leg cleanly broke in two and immediately 
deformed to the horror and gasps of the thinned crowd.&nbsp; Evan let out a blood-curdling scream that had 
not been otherwise heard in an hour.&nbsp; He didn�t buck or thrash much as his body had nothing left to 
give.&nbsp; Instead, he twitched uncontrollably.
Matt wasted no time watching his brother suffer, walked to the right leg, took aim and smashed the 
bones with the same perfection as the first time.&nbsp; It was truly the most grotesque sight of the day seeing 
Evan�s two lower legs broken in half and dangling horribly out of proportion.&nbsp; His twitching continued 
almost as if he was having a seizure.&nbsp; This was it.&nbsp; Evan was done.&nbsp; He was truly destroyed.
After a minute, Evan entered a deep unconscious state hanging by his wrists.&nbsp; His father invited the 
crowd to come to the arena, one bleacher section at a time, lining up in single file.&nbsp; The line stopped 20� 
away and the front person was allowed to approach in isolation.&nbsp; Each person touched him, usually in 
the lower stomach or hip area.&nbsp; It seemed everyone tried to avoid a cut, tear, wound or other bodily 
injury.&nbsp; But such areas were few and far between.&nbsp; Many looked at his brutalized genitals, but 
surprisingly none touched them, perhaps keenly aware of all the eyes upon them.&nbsp; Most glanced at the 
fractured and angulated lower legs that hung at grotesque angles.&nbsp; 
Evan�s friends still could not believe what hung before them.&nbsp; While they spent most of their young lives 
emerged in the Christian faith, they had a hard time comprehending such consensual violence on 
display.&nbsp; The guys almost threw up when they each saw Evan�s mutilated genitals.&nbsp; The girls openly cried 
that they probably lost their friend, and witnessed his murder first hand.&nbsp; 
Despite the horrors, everyone had a truly spiritual experience, surpassing each person�s expectations.&nbsp; 
Over the next 80 minutes, the remaining 200 people filed through and return to their seats.&nbsp; Evan never 
regained consciousness.
Dad addressed the crowd for the last time: �The Crucifixion of Evan has come to its conclusion.&nbsp; We have 
subjected Evan to an experience that mirrors in many ways what Jesus Christ experienced for each of us 
gathered here.&nbsp; We had to make obvious substitutions, but I believe the spirit of suffering has been 
honestly reflected in today�s events.&nbsp; We have brought Evan to death�s doorstep, but thanks to planning 
and the expert touch of Dr. Hendrix, he will not walk through that door.�
Dad: �This graphic, brutal experience will be seared into all of our minds forever.&nbsp; We are fortunate to 
have a striking example of manhood before us that allowed us to share in this magical experience.&nbsp; I 
know I will live a changed life from this day forward and I am confident each of you will find meaning 
and inspiration from what you have witnessed.�
Dad: �Matt, it�s time to remove Evan from the Cross.�
Matt gathered the men and proceeded to carefully let Evan down.&nbsp; The doc was close by with a 
stretcher and an ATV, ready to transport him inside and to care.&nbsp; Evan remained unconscious 
throughout his journey freedom, which is probably for the best since all the attention would have 
caused him even more pain.&nbsp; That�s something he no longer needed.&nbsp; His suffering was complete.&nbsp; Nails 
were carefully removed.&nbsp; In the background, Dad led the group in the Lord�s Prayer.&nbsp; The crown was 
removed, leaving behind dried blood.&nbsp; Ropes were removed and Evan�s limp body was free.&nbsp; Doc and the 
guys moved him to the stretcher as the crowd looked on for any sign of life.&nbsp; Once he was placed on the 
ATV, Doc saw everyone looking and he gave a thumbs up indicating that Evan was indeed okay.&nbsp; At least 
he was alive, for now.

The Recovery and Resurrection
That first day in his medically-modified bedroom was touch and go for Evan.&nbsp; No one was really sure if 
he would pull through.&nbsp; The doctor and trusted aides set about the task of physically repairing his broken 
body.&nbsp; No surgery was required, but his body needed hundreds of stitches to close the dozens of flesh 
tears suffered at the hands of Matt�s skilled whippings.&nbsp; He probably didn�t need to be sewn up as much 
as he was, but the doctor wanted to absolutely minimize the potential for infection given how much of 
his body was exposed to the harsh elements.&nbsp; When complete, he wrapped Evan�s torso in bandages 
which would be regularly changed.&nbsp; Of course, he remained on a steady series of life-sustaining fluids 
and antibiotics. 
Attention then moved to Evan�s fractured legs.&nbsp; Fortunately, Matt only hit the tibia and fibula one time 
each, resulting in clean midline fractures.&nbsp; The doctor set both bones and applied casts to his legs.&nbsp; Since 
both legs were fractured, rehab time would take several months.
The doctor carefully examined the four holes in Evan�s limbs.&nbsp; Each of the four holes grew in size from 
their original puncture due to the thrashing Evan did while on the cross.&nbsp; Fortunately, Matt placed each 
of the nails exactly as prescribed and it doesn�t appear he would lose sensory or motor function.&nbsp; 
However, definitive diagnosis would come when he awakened and performed range of motion tests.&nbsp; 
The holes themselves were cleaned and dressed.
The cuts to his head from the crown of barbed wire were superficial requiring no attention beyond 
cleaning.
Evan�s anus was another story.&nbsp; A careful and thorough and careful examination led the doctor to 
conclude that Evan may never regain normal bowel control.&nbsp; His anal ring was torn beyond repair, 
muscles were damaged and skin tears were everywhere.&nbsp; Infection was also a strong possibility as fresh 
fecal material would mix into the bloody interior walls of his hole.&nbsp; For now, the doctor installed a fecal 
collection bag.
Finally, the doctor turned to Evan�s groin, the unanticipated victims of this event.&nbsp; The penis was swollen 
and dotted with purple impact marks.&nbsp; Any bleeding that was there had since subsided.&nbsp; The member 
itself appeared fine and should recover with no lasting issues.&nbsp; Evan�s right testicle, however, was 
another story.&nbsp; It�s a swollen purple mass and appeared to be filling with fluid.&nbsp; The left testicle was 
swollen as well, but nowhere near as bad.&nbsp; It also was adorned with bruises, but it appears it would 
recover.&nbsp; The doctor palpates the right mass, but was unable to fell the testicle itself given all the fluid 
build-up.&nbsp; It would have to be drained.

While the doctor and aides attend to Evan�s injuries, his family waited in the house for news of his 
recovery.&nbsp; The doctor emerged at 3 a.m. and gave his update.&nbsp; Evan was stable and in a deep sleep but 
there�s every reason to believe he would survive.&nbsp; His primary concerns were infection, his anus and his 
right testicle.&nbsp; Time would tell on both.&nbsp; Mom, dad and Mary prayed together and drifted to bed.
The next day and the day after Evan remained deep asleep.&nbsp; The doctor and others tended to his 
wounds and saw steady progress in every area except his anus and right testicle.&nbsp; By the third day, the 
doctor determined the testicle must be removed.&nbsp; Matt was devastated at the news.&nbsp; All he wanted to 
do was hurt his brother, not take castrate him.&nbsp; Before surgery, Matt visited Evan�s bedside and cried 
out apologies and begged for future forgiveness.
Finally, on the fourth day, Evan began to come around, clouded in a daze.&nbsp; Attempts at meaningful 
conversation are useless, but on the fifth day, Evan at up in bed, ate on his own and finally had real 
conversation with his family.&nbsp; 
Evan: �The wounds still hurt, but it�s a dull pain.&nbsp; I know it will be over soon.&nbsp; I am so grateful to each of 
you for making this happen.&nbsp; I�m sure you were worried about me, but you have no idea what this has 
done for me.&nbsp; I look upon this room and each of you and see everything through new eyes.&nbsp; Everything is 
crisper; every word has more meaning; every picture on the wall is a work of art speaking to me.&nbsp; It�s 
hard to describe what I feel ... I�m just � changed.�
And conversation went on like this for a couple hours.&nbsp; Mostly the family listened as Evan attempted to 
put into words the spiritual awakening he was experiencing.&nbsp; But every now and then someone got in a 
word.&nbsp; They�ve yet to recount the events of the 4 days of isolation and crucifixion itself.&nbsp; The family 
figured he would bring it up when he was ready.&nbsp; For now, he experienced a new world for the first time.&nbsp; 
Everyone spoke except for Matt and Evan noticed.
Evan: �What�s wrong Matt?&nbsp; You haven�t said anything.&nbsp; Don�t feel guilty about what you did.&nbsp; You did an 
amazing job beating me.&nbsp; It was everything I could have hoped for � and more.�
Matt: �You don�t know everything.�
Evan looked inquisitively: �What do you mean?�
Matt: �I, uh, I don�t know how to say it.&nbsp; Do you remember when I beat your front side?�
Evan: �Of course; it was horrible yet purifying.�
Matt: �Do you remember when I hit you low?�
Evan: �� I think so � it�s kind of fuzzy.&nbsp; Yeah, that�s right.&nbsp; I remember now.&nbsp; Wow, that was intense.&nbsp; I 
wasn�t expecting it.�
Matt: �Yeah, well.&nbsp; I�m afraid I hit you too hard.�
Evan immediately pulled up his bed sheet and looked down.&nbsp; He saw his groin wrapped in bandages so 
he couldn�t see what his eyes were looking for.&nbsp; �What happened?�
Matt started openly crying: �I�m so sorry Evan.&nbsp; Your right � um � it�s gone.�
Evan had a blank look on his face but quickly composed himself.
Evan: �Matt, look at me.� Matt did, but kept crying.&nbsp; �I was prepared to possibly die up there.&nbsp; I begged 
you to beat me in the most horrible way.&nbsp; I needed to suffer worse than imaginable in order to allow for 
my spiritual awakening.&nbsp; And it worked.&nbsp; If a little piece of me is lost, then so be it.&nbsp; Is everything else still 
there and working?�
His dad chimed in cause Matt could not compose himself: �Yes, the doctor said the rest of it is fine and 
in full working order.&nbsp; You will be able to have kids.�
Mary, who was listening to this intimate discussion, blushed the whole time.
Evan: �Then no harm done.&nbsp; Matt, I forgive you.&nbsp; On second thought � I thank you.&nbsp; I have sacrificed a 
part of my flesh for my rebirth.&nbsp; Maybe there�s divine intervention at work here.&nbsp; The cost of being 
reborn is a part of my own reproduction system.&nbsp; I can�t imagine a more fitting sacrifice.&nbsp; Thank you 
Matt.&nbsp; I love you.�
Matt couldn�t believe what he was hearing.&nbsp; Not only did he brother not hold ill will about losing his 
testicle, but he was actually thankful for it.&nbsp; Wow, for yet another time during this experience, his 
younger brother managed to inspire him.&nbsp; He was truly among greatness and knew his brother was 
destined to inspire the world.&nbsp; He dropped to his knees, took Evan�s hand between his own and 
embraced him with the love he so richly earned.
The rest of the family was equally moved by this experience and there wasn�t a dry eye in the room.&nbsp; 
And this is the way it was to be from here forward.&nbsp; Evan�s first act after rebirth was forgiveness for a 
disfigurement that no one else would grant.&nbsp; Mom and dad embraced and they knew their son had been 
touched by God and would not only recover from his physical injuries, but would become someone that 
many will flock to.
