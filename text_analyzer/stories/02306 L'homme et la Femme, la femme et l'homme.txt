Synopsis: Just an 'ode' or poem on the dual male-female roles or the male-female dynamic.L'homme et la Femme, la femme et l'homme.   
A gladiator sandman, 
  Into my dreams. 
  From a foreign land, 
  Relentless and clean. 
   
  Fair on the outside, 
  Crystal blue eyes. 
  Heart containing darkness. 
  Marvelous thighs. 
   
  An unexpected arrival, 
  Sneaking up on me. 
  Hand on hair, 
  Dark stare. 
  Seen to be believed. 
   
  A nomadic traveller, 
  Up with the dawn. 
  Binding me, 
  Blinding. 
  Striking and forlorn. 
   
  Travelling biped, 
  Heart of a Moor. 
  Maniacal madman, 
  Waiting at my door.   
------------------------------   
You're simply the toy, strictly for
    pleasure. 
  All control begins in the mind, 
  At my sensual leisure. 
  Lust feverishly pumps in your veins, 
  While you wait. 
  Until I select which punishment for you to take. 
   
  Stainless steel matches well with your eyes. 
  The tip of the smooth crop, 
  Caressing the insides of your thighs. 
  Fear well contained as you inhale, 
  Waiting anxiously for more to prevail. 
   
  My wishes are crimson, my commands many. 
  Stand against the wall until you hear my call, 
  Don't ask for how many. 
  Locked still and firmly into place. 
  My breath against your blindfold face. 
  Hands up, a foot apart and over your head, 
  I ask you to strip, your brows crease instead. 
   
  A crack of the crop, on your smooth hot flesh, 
  'Your insolence doesn't please me, you whore.' I say. 
  Silent and blindfolded, waiting to lick. 
  'Get on the bed, on your back and don't spit!' 
  Stainless steel manacles suit you well,  
  They click and make the most seductive sound as you can tell. 
   
  Evil and cruel, wanton and blind, 
  Hovering over your mouth like the tide. 
  Instructed and handled like a trained beast, 
  Your tongue tips my velvet your eager to please. 
   
  I keep you there until your tattered and torn. 
  Rapture reflected in my eyes, 
  As my fingers pinch your thighs. 
  My corruption well adapted from your little boy roar. 
  Enjoy it? Of course you do, can you really cry poor? 
  Get your body up, making you stand, 
  Order you to hold your cock in your hand. 
   
  'Come on play for me now!' 
  As I sit and comfortably watch. 
  'Look at me while you do it, no don't stare!' 
  Forbidden to look at a spot elsewhere,  
   
   
  As you await more torturous instruction, 
  I slap you some more with a sudden compulsion. 
   
  Miss Marquise, to you. 
  You taste so sweet. 
  As my tongue sails around, 
  Your radiant hard heat. 
  Just a few seconds, 
  No more. 
  I'll bring you to your knees. 
  You're my toy, 
  Sex slave, 
  And whore.   
 ----------------------------   
Domination, subjugation, 
  Like mercury they weigh. 
  The very two words that make your head sway.  
   
  My tongue over and wetting your skin, 
  About turn, so sharp when I begin. 
  'Shut it, clamp it, and don't talk.' I say. 
  Your will becomes mine, 
  For the rest of the day. 
   
  The holiest of the Holies, 
  Sacred and profane. 
  Your backside weeping red, 
  With a crack of the cane. 
   
  'Bow to me, seek your forgiveness.' 
  Leave aside your little boy grimace. 
  Take your hands, 
  Put them where I say. 
  Any deviation, I'll make you pay. 
   
  Your lips are permitted to service me well. 
  From the tip of my nose, 
  To the depths of my hell. 
  Lava erupting, heating my thighs, 
  Your hand in between well disguised. 
  Slipping and sliding, 
  Opening my flower. 
  Lips on each petal, 
  Hungrier by the hour. 
   
  Gripped in place,  
  Not allowed to stop. 
  Reel you in once again, 
  From the bottom to the top. 
  Unleashed I now allow you to be. 
  Untied, 
  All seeing, 
  Able to speak. 
  For a short interlude, 
  You're free to play. 
  Let's see what you can do? 
  My ears hear myself say. 
   
  Oil kisses each pore of my skin, 
  As your fingers are about to begin. 
  A glance is all that you need, 
  To know where to start and how to proceed. 
  Finger my neck, tune each tiny muscle, 
  As I lay face down, giving you instruction. 
  Over each shoulder, kneading with ease, 
  Reaching midline going south to my crease. 
  You know what I want, 
  Yet you're uncertain. 
  Will it incur my wrath? 
  Or a certain salvation? 
   
  You may be large and infused, 
  With the power to wield in any way chosen. 
  My word is one, set in stone, 
  Frozen. 
  It can make you soar, 
  Or eat you whole. 
  Sexy sweet slave boy,  
  Very creative. 
  Invoked by my purely depraved imagination. 
   
  Caressing your mind, 
  Fellating your thoughts. 
  Come on and fuck it. 
  This secret sweet place,  
  Come on and part me. 
  Enter inside, 
  Covert mission. 
  Spread me wide. 
   
  It's so tight, a backdoor dream, 
  Ever so much the slave-boy treat. 
  'Slowly, yes!'  
  Obey each instruction. 
   
  Skin over skin, 
  Sliding so fast. 
  Your nearing your time, get ready to cum. 
  Within every inch, 
  All the way inside. 
  A scream leaves your lips,  
  My smile very wide. 
   
  Watch you doze, 
  As I stroke your cheek. 
  My mind wanders over your body 
  As you sleep. 
  Free, untied, 
  Not at my feet. 
   
  Sunshine washes over my lids, 
  An omen of misfortune?  
  Or did I hear you sneeze? (I must have forgotten) 
  Your whisper caresses the skin on my ear. 
   
  'Darlin' don't get up, your turn to fear&hellip;' 
   
  From bottom to the top, 
  I make you melt, 
  Never needing the cool swish of a belt. 
  Laughing, smiling and spurring you on, 
  Humiliatingly powerful, 
  Is my song. 
   
  'Not tight enough try once again!' 
  You strap my wrists firmer to the bed. 
  'Too soft, can you get it right!' 
  One hard slap on my behind. 
  'That's much better, I'm very proud of you slave.' 
  From soft to hard, 
  You're ready to cum again.
