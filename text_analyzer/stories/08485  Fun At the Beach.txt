Synopsis:     A dom and his slave go to the beach






An Afternoon At the Beach (Part one)
�
This morning Master woke up in a very good mood. My morning spanking was� light, almost playful unlike yesterday's which had left still visible marks on my ass� and thighs.
�
"Sweets, today we go to the beach. Go pack a lunch. We'll stop for� breakfast and ice on the way." I quickly arose and hurried off to make� lunch, while Master showered and glanced at the morning paper.
�
"What shall I wear, Master?"
�
"All you'll need is that blue longyi and sandals."
�
"No bikini?", I asked hopefully.
�
"No."
�
Damn. No swimming for me. Oh well.� The ocean is so cold here, swimming� &#8232;is not all that pleasant anyway. But a bit of sun bathing would be nice.� Still the longyi can easily be pulled up so I can get some sun on my� legs.
�
I stepped into the longyi and tied it tightly over my breasts as Master� had taught me, then quickly stepped into my sandals. Master hates it� when he senses that I am dawdling, even if I'm not. 
�
He came back from the garage with a small ice chest and a small leather� case. "Here. Put in your discipline collar, leash, cuffs and the braided� dog whip." He tossed me the leather case.
�
I hesitated only a moment before, "Yes, Master" and hurried off. I hated� that dog whip. I don't know what possessed me to buy it for him as a� gift last Christmas. It hurts like hell even when he is not using it� hard, and leaves long ugly weals. But what would he do with them at the� beach? He never disciplines me that way in public.
�
I came out of the bedroom, the case filled as he asked, but before I� could ask about the day he told me. "Today, pet, I want you to be my� pet, my little bitch dog. From now until we get back, you will not say a� word. If I ask you something that can't be answered with a yes or no,� you will whine like a dog. For yes, bark once. For no bark twice. Do you� understand?
�
I started to say my usual "Yes, Master", but something in his look� caught me and instead I went, "Arf".
�
"Arf? Is that a dog's bark? What kind of dog goes 'ARF'?" 
�
I made whining sounds and then tried a "WOOF". 
�
"That sounds like a toy Saint Bernard. Maybe you should stick to the� ARF. Can you wag your tail?"
�
I ARFed and wiggled my ass.
�
He laughed. "I knew you would be a natural at tail wagging." He patted� my hair and scratched behind my ear. I licked his hand and he smiled at� me. "Good dog." This could be fun!
�
He took the leash out of the case and snapped it onto my every day�collar, then handed me the case and ice chest to carry out to the car.
�
No one was around this early on a Sunday morning so I got to the car� with only a small blush to show my humiliation. In a few minutes we were� driving down the freeway, his hand stroking my cunt as he almost� mindlessly did whenever we drove anywhere. I leaned back and closed my� eyes, enjoying the feel of his hand, the way his fingers so very gently� touched and caressed my clit. In only a few minutes I was on the edge of� coming. I usually warned him when this happened so I could get� permission to orgasm. 

I started whining. 

He ignored me. 

My hands started� moving to his but I stopped them. Only once had I ever tried to stop him� with my hands. I'll never do that again. 
�
Then the torture began. I tried counting cars, reading bill boards,� going over last week's household budget. I glanced at him. He seemed to� be intent on watching the road. Did he know what he was doing to me? Or� was this a game. I never knew.
�
I found my hips starting to push forward into his hand. Damn hips! Don't� do that! I whined louder, more pitifully, I hoped. It worked. He turned� to me, his hand stopping for a moment. "Oh, does doggie need to go for a� walk? Have to pee?"
�
I didn't really, but that sounded like a good idea at the time, so I� ARFed once. I could run into the rest room at a gas station and calm� down.
�
"Okay. Good doggie for telling me." He patted my head and pulled the car� off the next exit. There was a short strip of grass next to the freeway� with a few shrubs scattered here and there. He opened the door and� slipped the leash on me, tugging me out of the car.
�
I started panicking. Surely he didn't expect me to pee here. 
�
But he did. 
�
"Dogs don't usually walk on their hind legs, do they?"
�
Shit! Trapped by my own lie. I ARFed twice and slowly bent over so my� hands were on the ground. He tugged at the leash and led me to a bush.� "How about this one?" I looked around. No one was looking. I could hear� the cars whizzing by on the freeway just above me. But I couldn't do it.� 
&#8232;"ARF, ARF".
�
"No? How do you know? You haven't sniffed it yet. Maybe it's a good� place for a dog to go. Give it a good sniff." I wanted to curl up and� die. How could he do this to me? 

"Well?" 

I pushed my head forward and� sniffed. I don't know what odor my nose picked up. It didn't smell like� a plant. Then I felt arousal creeping down my stomach into my loins. How� could I become aroused being treated like a dog? At the same time I felt� tears welling up in my eyes. 
�
I quickly crawled back to Master and put my arms around his legs,� holding him tightly. He didn't say anything for a while then patted my� hair, listening to me sob as I started crying. "I guess you didn't� really have to go did you?" I shook my head and managed two quasi-ARFs.� He sighed and walked to the car, tugging on my leash. "Get in." I stood� up and got in. He unleashed me and tossed the leash in the back. In a� moment we were back on the road. But no hand was between my legs.
�
When we pulled off for breakfast he was quiet. I sat across from him,� not daring to look at him. He ordered for us as he usually does without� asking me. After a quiet breakfast he pulled out some bills and tossed� them on the table. "Here. Go buy some ice across the street and put it� in the ice chest." 
�
I forgot and started to say, "Yes, M..." but stopped and let out a� pitiful ARF. He didn't say anything, so I took the money and headed off.��
 &#8232;We stopped again at a small grocery and bought some sandwiches and� drinks. A bit later we were back on the road.
�
"This was supposed to be a fun day.", he said after a while. "But even� on fun days you can't lie to me. It would have been better to have come� without permission than to lie to me." I squirmed in my seat, not� knowing how a dog could agree, so I nodded. "Think about this and when� we get home tonight, you can talk to me about it. Then I'll decide what� should be done." His hand went to my thigh and rested there, just an� inch away from my clit.
�
Soon we were at the turn off to the beach. But he drove right past it� without a word. Sometimes his mind goes into automatic. Had he forgotten� to turn? Were we on the way to the university? I made some questioning� whines and he smiled. "I didn't miss the turn off." 
�
A few exits later he did turn off and then another turn onto a small� bumpy road that soon became a dirt road. Ahead I saw a few cars parked� where the road ended. He stopped and we got out. 
�
It was a beautiful spot, cliffs surrounding a small strip of beach a� hundred feet or so below us. A narrow path wound down to the beach where� a few people were already enjoying the morning sun. He gave me the ice� chest, snapped the leash on, and with the other case in his hand started� down the path. I followed.
�
As we went down I noticed that there were mostly men at the beach and� all were naked. Master stopped all of a sudden with a "Damn. I forgot� the blanket. It's in the trunk of the car. Sit that down and go get it."� 
&#8232;The thing I hate most about our relationship, maybe the only thing I� really hate, is having to run and fetch things. But it goes with the� territory, so with a sigh I do as I'm told. Master is very forgetful, a� real absentminded professor, so I end up being the one to go get things� he forgets. 
�
As I got near the top of the cliff I heard a woman's angry voice. "Bad� doggie.", followed by the sound of something being struck and a whining� sound. I bristle at the thought of anyone mistreating a dog and hurried� the few steps to the top. A woman was standing over a man kneeling at� her feet, unfastening a leash from the collar attached to him. He had a� fresh weal on his back, I assumed from the quirt she had in her hand.� She saw me and sniffed haughtily before starting off down the path to� the beach. I felt embarrassed and didn't know what to say.
�
He stood up, grinned at me, and picked up a large chest to follow her. He had on a skimpy thong, his body beautifully tanned and muscled. My� eyes couldn&#8217;t stay away from the large bulge in the front of his thong.� He hurried on by me, glancing back once with a bold look before� disappearing down the path. 
�
A small warning bell was starting to ring in the back of my mind as I� got the blanket.
�
Master had carried the ice chest the rest of the way and had chosen a� spot in the morning shade under the cliff. I spread out the blanket and� kneeled to wait for instructions.
�
"Hmmmm. Dogs don&#8217;t kneel, do they." I tried to think how a dog sat. Ass� on ground, hind feet forward, fore paws on the ground. I didn&#8217;t think I� could sit like that. My legs were too long. I leaned forward and put my� elbows on the ground and brought my face down to my hands. "Good! That� will do fine. You can even roll over on your back and I can scratch your� stomach." 
�
I tried to get back into the mood so I stuck my tongue out and panted a� bit. Master laughed out loud as he watched. "You must have been a dog in� some prior life!". I ARFed.
�
I looked up at him standing there staring at me, such a proud look on� his face. Deck shoes, faded denims, a blue tee shirt, and that captain&#8217;s� hat he wore so often. He was so handsome. How wonderful it felt to be� his. 
�
He sat down on the blanket and I crawled over to him to put my head in� his lap. He smiled and stroked my hair. Bliss! Warm morning, cool ocean� breezes, beautiful blue sky, my love stroking me with his hand; what� more could I ask for?
�
After a bit he stood up and stretched. "Let&#8217;s walk along the beach.� Perhaps some mermaids will sing to me." I smiled at his Prufrock� reference and started to comment before settling for an "ARF". 
�
He reached over and untied my longyi. Uh oh. "Doggies don&#8217;t wear clothes� at the beach." It slipped down and I stepped out of it, looking around� to see who was watching. Of course no one was. It was a nude beach,� after all. He snapped the leash on my collar and off we started. He� stopped and looked at me, for a bit. "Hmmmm. This won&#8217;t quite do. Dogs� don&#8217;t walk on two legs." He stroked his beard thoughtfully. "I don&#8217;t� want you getting your knees all raw from the sand.� Try walking on hands� and feet."
�
I looked at him blankly for a moment. Hands and feet? Is he kidding? No.� He was serious.
�
I bent over until my hands touched the sand. This caused my ass to stick� up. I bent my legs a bit to lower it but then I had to spread my thighs� a bit exposing myself dreadfully. I tried to look up at him with a� pleading look on my face but even that was hard with my head so low.
�
"Not very doggie like, but I suppose it will have to do." He reached in� the bag and pulled out a tennis ball. I silently screamed "NO!" as it� came to me what he was about to have me do. I just knew he had that evil� grin on his face, the one he gets whenever I&#8217;m about to suffer some new� indignity or pain.
�
I heard him move quickly and then the command, "Fetch." I winced� thinking about how silly I must look but couldn&#8217;t bring myself to move.� "Well?" 

I whined.

 "Do it." 

Please, Master.

 "Now!"
�
I started moving away towards the ocean. Where was the ball, anyway?� With my head so low it was hard to see. I assumed it would roll downhill� so I started that way. God, how awful. I quickly found that putting my� hands flat was painful so I switched to making small fists. Then this� image of our trip to the zoo and especially the gorilla exhibit came to� me. I was using my knuckles like they did. I could feel an even stronger blush creeping up my neck and into my face.
�
I spotted the bright green of the ball and waddled over to it. It was� covered with sand, of course. I had no idea if I could even pick it up� in my mouth. I bent down and blew on it, causing some of the loose sand� to fall off. Then I opened my mouth as wide as I could and surprised� myself by actually getting a grip on it.
�
How could I possibly feel proud of my self at that moment? I&#8217;m sure I� looked absolutely ridiculous, totally naked, ass in the air, pussy� gaping open behind, and a green ball in my mouth. Still there was this� rush of having achieved something. I must be sick to feel this way. I� turned and started back.
�
It was easier going back up than down. My ass didn&#8217;t feel quite as high� &#8232;and I could straighten out my legs more. I saw Master&#8217;s legs and headed� &#8232;towards him. "Good girl!" He patted me on the head and I dropped the� &#8232;ball at his feet. 

That was a mistake. I had slobbered all over one side� of the ball and now sand was stuck all over it. He bent over and� carefully picked it up with thumb and forefinger, shaking it a bit to� get some of the sand off. Then another swift movement and another� "Fetch".
�
"NO", I screamed to myself, as I started to wonder how long it would be� before he tired of this game. But along with the embarrassment, the� humiliation, was the realization that I was incredibly aroused. Deep� down I knew that with each of these little games we played, the bond� between us grew stronger; that a few days from now when I was 500 miles�away, I would recapture this moment again and again with feelings of� love as well as arousal. So I turned and actually tried trotting after� the ball.
�
I got a mouth full of sand when I picked it up and even more when I had� to pick it up a second time after dropping it. I had never seen a dog� spit, so after I dropped it at his feet I tried gathering the sand into� a wad in my mouth. I wasn&#8217;t going to swallow the sand, but I thought I� would spit it out when I went off to "fetch" again. 
�
But Master tired of the game quicker than I thought and instead of� tossing it a third time sat down and pulled me onto his lap to cuddle.
�
"I love you so much, mi dulce esclavita." I started melting into his� arms. He bent down to kiss me. I had a mouth full of spit and sand. I� had never refused a kiss from him, so being a good slave, I swallowed� hard and opened my mouth for his tongue.
�










Fun at the Beach, (Part II)
�
"Hello, Lawrence." A woman's voice interrupted the idyllic moment. I�
felt Master raise his head from mine as his hands pressed down on me to�
indicate I should keep my position.
�
"Felicity! How are you?" Did I detect a note of pleasure in his voice?�
Who the hell is Felicity? Already my feelings for her�were becoming less felicitous.
�
I felt Master stand up, leaving me stretched out on the blanket on my�
stomach. I carefully peeked around and saw him move closer to her and�
hold out his arms for a hug. It was the woman at the top of the cliff,�
the one with the male slave. Pretty with a thin tight body and the�
skimpiest bikini I could imagine. I turned my head away before they�
hugged.
�
The pleasantries between them like old dear friends - or former lovers -�
exchange were hardly heard by me as my green monster roared out of its�
cage. I felt my thighs pressing together and my ass cheeks clenching as�
I forced myself to stay in position.
�
" ... my slave, lani. She's been mine for almost five years now."
�
"She's lovely, Lawrence. I saw her briefly at the top of the cliff. Why�
don't you have her turn around so I can get a better look at her."
�
Shit. I hoped I didn't have to go through my display positions in front�
of this bitch.
�
"In a moment, Fel. Who do you have on the end of your leash?"
�
"Who? What you mean." I could feel her evil smile. "This is my pet,�
teddie. I picked him up a few months ago. He had been pretty well�
trained but still has a few things to learn, right pet?" I glanced�
furtively over my other shoulder at her "pet". It was the man in thongs,�
this time naked, squatting in the sand, his cock, half erect, dangling�
between his thighs pointing in my direction, his eyes staring intently�
at my ass.
�
"Woof"
�
Had Master arranged this? It seemed too much of a coincidence. Maybe�
there were more doggie slaves at the beach today. He rarely tells me�
what to expect when we go out. Says he likes to keep me on my toes. On�
my knees would be more accurate.
�
And this started out as such a great day.
�
"Nice, Fel. You always had such good taste in slaves." I heard her light�
laugh.
�
"Lani. Display. Position one."
�
Shit. Double shit. He was going to do it. Without thinking my body�
started moving as it was taught. I turned around and got to my knees,�
hands behind head, back straight, shoulders back so my breasts were�
nicely displayed, head submissively bowed, knees wide apart, thrusting�
my bare sex out in case someone wanted to touch it.
�
"She's really cute, Lawrence." Her hand patted my head. "I see you still�
like small breasted slaves." Small? My breasts weren't small. They were�
just right for my body. I felt my face starting to burn. Then I felt�
Master's hand at the back of my head over my hands caressing me, calming�
me, telling me it would be okay. It always amazes me how quickly that�
calms me down.
�
I could see Teddie still squatting a few feet in front of me, his cock�
now fully erect, a big grin on his face. Damn. He was big. I couldn't�
help wondering what it would feel like to have him inside me. I glanced�
at his face. Sort of cute if you like that European model look.
�
Damn. I do. He was staring at me. Shit. I could feel my body starting to�
react. Damned body. I no longer have any control over it. What will�
Master think if he sees me getting aroused by this man? Then I realized�
I was staring at him, too. I looked down at his cock. It was bobbing up�
and down. Why? Oh God! Is Master going to mate me with him like a bitch�
in heat? The thought scared the hell out of me and at the same time�
started a flood between my legs. Sometimes I had long strings of what�
Master called my love juice dangling from my pussy. Was it showing? I�
bent forward a little to look.
�
"Position two, pet."
�
No! But my body was well trained. It immediately started into position,�
face in the sand, back arched down to present my ass and cunt, knees�
still wide apart, arms stretched forward with wrists crossed to receive�
binding.
�
"Nice, Lawrence. So well trained."
�
"Yes." I could feel the tone of pride in my Master's voice.
�
"See how nicely she's trained, Teddie?"
�
"Woof."
�
I heard soft crunching in the sand as she walked around behind me.�
Master knelt beside me, again his hand gently massaging the back of my�
neck, helping me to get through this.
�
"May I touch her, Lawrence?" No. Please say no.
�
I waited as the hand continued to stroke my neck.
�
"Sure. No penetration, please."
�
I felt a soft hand touch the small of my back then a single finger�
tracing my backbone down to my ass. I shuddered.
�
"Lovely skin. Where is she from?"
�
"She's from Mexico. Her father was Japanese."
�
'That explains the exquisite shape of her eyes."
�
Now both hands were on my hips, her thumbs almost touching. She slowly�
spread my ass cheeks apart as I frantically tried to keep them closed.
�
"She doesn't like this, Lawrence. Don't you use her here?" The hand�
stopped stroking my neck for a moment.
�
"She's not had much experience with a woman, Fel." Then to me, "Relax.�
Don't fight it." His hand started stroking me again. I forced my self to�
relax my ass cheeks.
�
"She responds so well to you. She must love you deeply." Her hands once�
again opened me up.
�
"What a cute little anal button. I bet she's really tight back here. Oh�
look. She's already dripping wet."
�
I was losing it. I could feel myself slowly sinking down, down, down. I�
started blocking her out, concentrating on Master's touch, knowing he�
wouldn't allow anything bad to happen to me. As always, it worked. My�
mind removed itself from my body and just observed. I pictured Feli-
shitty looking at my ass and started smiling at the notion of my body�
farting. I could feel a giggle building up which I had to work hard at�
suppressing. Her voice became tiny, something far off.
�
"Here Teddie." I heard him crunching in the sand as he moved around�
behind me. "God, look at his cock. He's ready to fuck her." I felt a�
light touch and then several short sniffs. "Does she smell good?"
�
"Woof." Then strong hands on my hips pulling me back.
�
"No Teddie. Bad doggie", followed by the sound of a whip against skin. I�
pulled away and rolled over on my side, doubling my knees up against my�
chest. Felicity had him on a short leash with a choke collar. She was�
pulling on him and lashing at his back at the same time. He went to his�
knees and put his head on the ground in front of her, whining. I cringed�
as she let him have several hard welt raising strokes across his back.
�
"Jeez, Fel, where did you get this one? I hope he is just playing the�
dog."
�
"I'm sure he is. He's a big teddy bear, aren't you sweetie?"
�
Teddie whined and woofed sullenly or perhaps with disappointment. I was�
never good at translating barks.
�
"God, he really wants to fuck her Lawrence. Don't you snookums."
�
"Woof"
�
I stole a quick look at Master who was rolling his eyes. I didn't know�
if I should get back in position or not so I just laid there quietly not�
at all happy with the way the conversation was going nor with the way my�
body was reacting. Could I actually allow myself to be fucked by some�
stud like a bitch in heat? I was repulsed on one level and attracted on�
another. I couldn't help wonder if anyone had brought a condom.
�
"I brought a condom." Damn her. Was she reading my mind.
�
Master clipped a leash on my collar and pointed to his side. I quickly�
rose to my knees and crawled over next to him. "We'll see. Let's take a�
walk along the beach, show off our pets."
�
"I've done that already." She had such a whiny pouty tone. It must be�
awful to have her as an owner.
�
"Well I haven't.", he snapped and turned quickly, yanking irritably on�
my leash. "I'm not sure this doggie game is such a good idea." Then to�
me, "Stand up, turn around." He snapped my wrist cuffs together behind�
my back. I stared down at the blanket but could see teddie just out of�
the corner of my eyes. He was lying on his side facing me, a hand�
stroking his cock. I tried not to look but found my eyes wandering back�
again and again to his cock and the impudent look in his eyes as he�
stared openly at my cunt.
�
"Teddie! You naughty dog." She giggled and swatted at him lightly with�
her whip. He yelped and rolled over close to her to start licking her�
feet. "Honestly, Lawrence, I don't think I can control him much longer.
�
Master was rummaging around in our bag. "If I have to control him, Fel,�
he's not likely to want to fuck for some time." He pulled out the strict�
posture collar and stood up. I don't think Master was as large as teddie�
but the look on his face spelled a determination that made me feel safe.
�
I waited quietly as Master tightened the collar and slipped the padlock�
through it. As always my body produced a wave of goose flesh as I heard�
the click of the lock. I slipped down, down, down, to that space again,�
aware only of Master and his words, ready to do whatever he asked of me.
�
"You may walk upright." He gave a tug and we headed off down the beach.�
I heard him muttering under his breath, "She can be such a bitch at�
times..." I knew he wasn't speaking of me.
�
The walk along the beach was pleasant. I kept my head up, not that the�
collar would allow me to lower it, but with pride. My eyes were down�
almost closed. I watched Master's bare feet and rolled up pants as he�
walked along, sometimes into the water sometimes onto the hot dry sand.�
Some people along the beach stared at us but no one said anything. I was�
glad this was an adults only beach.
�
Then I saw a young woman come out of the ocean in front of us and glance�
our way. She did a double take and stopped right in front of us to�
stare, her mouth open, eyes big. Master stopped suddenly. "Yes?"
�
"I'm sorry." And she quickly darted up the beach to her towel. I smiled�
inwardly. I knew what she felt, the yearning to be taken like I was. She�
was young and pretty. I glanced over at her sitting down on a blanket�
with three other girls her age. They were giggling and staring. She was�
just staring, her mouth still not closed.
�
Soon after Master stopped and hugged me tightly. "You okay?" he�
whispered in my ear.
�
"I'm fine, Master, very fine", the words out before I remembered I�
wasn't allowed to speak when in this collar.
�
He hugged me for a while, ignoring the break in protocol. "Just�
remember, honey, I love you very much."
�
I knew it was okay to answer. We connect on such a deep empathetic�
level. "It's okay, Master. I'll be fine." I also knew then I was to be�
fucked that day by teddie.
�
He kissed me long and hard. I could feel some wetness on my cheek and�
knew he was weeping a little. He sighed. "Let's go." He unclicked my�
collar and wrist cuffs and we walked back along the beach hand in hand�
like the lovers we were.
�
As we passed the four girls the one so entranced was sitting alone on�
her blanket. I looked at her and smiled. Some day, if you are lucky, you�
too will meet your real Master, one who owns your soul as well as your�
body.
