=======================================================
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Debbie came in IRC one day trolling.&nbsp; I decided to
find out a bit more and got this fantasy.&nbsp; I'm not sure
if Debbie was genuine or not but whatever the case I
thought it would make a story.

Debbie, sorry for nicking your idea without asking you
(don't you just feel so used!).&nbsp; I don't know how to
contact you.&nbsp; If you e-mail me, I'm sure I can think
of some way to make it up to you ;)

=======================================================

*debbie* My fantasy---&gt;
*debbie* I go to a job interview as a "products tester"
&nbsp; and it turns out to be testing bondage gear including
&nbsp; punishment devices like exercise equipment etc.
*debbie* What makes me heaps excited is that I don't
&nbsp; get forced but bribed and tricked with things like
&nbsp; fake pics of my friends doing it and pics of it in a
&nbsp; classy magazine (faked)
*debbie* I have to "test" things like
*debbie* -clamps in all different places
*debbie* -latex suits
*debbie* -long patent leather boots and gloves
*debbie* -breast bondage devices including suction
*debbie* -gags
*debbie* -anal items
*debbie* -vagina items
*debbie* -forced feeding through a gag
*debbie* but it all has to be done like a proper
&nbsp; interview not "now I have you" sort of thing, I am
&nbsp; naive.&nbsp; And I always have choices, like 1.gag 2.
&nbsp; breast suction or 3.butt plug testing.
*debbie* I am excited about latex suits with
&nbsp; removable panels and devices placed on my body,
&nbsp; but always with a good reason to do it, testing
&nbsp; etc.
*debbie* I am 18 years old 5'8" slim 62kg long
&nbsp; blonde hair green eyes dd cup bra

=======================================================

"Hold all my calls Ann.&nbsp; Thank you."

Sean poured himself a fresh cup of coffee took off his
jacket and loosened his tie.&nbsp; He rotated round in his
executive leather chair and put his feet up on the
window still of his corner office.&nbsp; It had been a busy
morning of staff meetings, meetings with customers
and meetings about meetings.&nbsp; He relaxed a bit and
mulled over a CV.&nbsp; He picked up the phone and called
Sara.

"Hi Sara, just wanted to touch base with you about the
Debbie Larson CV.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I just read it.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Sure.
I thought that experience was especially relevant.&nbsp; I'd
definatly agree with you there.&nbsp; We should get her in
for an interview.&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Tuesday morning sound good?
Excellent, I'll get Amy to arrange it.&nbsp; Laters."

"Amy, get Debbie Larson in Tuesday A.M. and tell Frank
to find out everything we can about her.&nbsp; Cheers."

=======================================================

The KSD Enterprises building in London's docklands was
very impressive.&nbsp; Debbie looked up at the high rise
glass fronted building with a sense of awe.&nbsp; She
watched some people leaving the building and wondered
what they did.&nbsp; She realized that she didn't actually
know very much about KSD.&nbsp; She didn't know what
services they provided or what products they
manufactured, except that they needed a products
tester and that was her dream career.

She had been given the lead by her best friend Claire
who worked at KSD as a office administrator and Claire
had always been strangly cagey about what they did.
However, she always seemed strangly eager to go to work
so that was a very good sign.

Debbie entered the building and went through to
reception.

"Hi, I'm Debbie Larson.&nbsp; I'm here for an interview at
ten."

"Ah yes Miss Larson, we've been expecting you.&nbsp; I'll
let Mr Adams know you're here.&nbsp; If you could sign in
here and I'll print your visitors pass."

Debbie signed her name the book while the receiptionst
printed out a pass.&nbsp; The receptionist handed her a
strange looking item of clothing.&nbsp; It looked like a
corset.&nbsp; Debbie gave the receptionst a strange look.

"It's just a piece of saftey clothing."

"Why do I have to wear it?"

"You'll be visiting the products testing area during
your interview and that is needed to comply with health
and saftey regulations.&nbsp; Don't worry the area is quite
safe, it's just a precaution.&nbsp; There is a changing
booth in the ladies room, just go down the hall and
it's on the left."

Debbie stood for a minute looking at the rather unusual
corset thinking it must be some kind of joke but the
receptionist looked like she didn't think anything out
of the ordinary about it so it must have been OK.
Debbie headed for the ladies room.

Debbie slipped out of her smart business suit and spun
the saftey corset round working out which way it should
go.&nbsp; She had never touched, much less put on a corset
before.&nbsp; It seemed to be made of a very thin material
like latex.&nbsp; She realized that it wouldn't show
through her business suit except for some strange
attachments sewn in.&nbsp; She wondered what sort of dangers
it would be protecting her from.

She slipped the corset on snapped on the catches.&nbsp; She
noticed the devices sewn in lined up with her crotch
and nipples.&nbsp; Debbie started to worry and thought
about taking the thing off.&nbsp; It was then she realized
that there was no obvious way to undo the catches.

Thinking that they'd tell her how to undo them later
she got dressed and went back to reception.&nbsp; The
receptionist was grinning inanely at her.

"Good, Miss Larson."&nbsp; Debbie sensed the receptionist
had taken a more superior tone with her.&nbsp; "Mr. Adams is
delayed in a meeting for ten minutes.&nbsp; The hospitality
area is on the 30th floor, you can go there to keep
yourself entertained while you wait.&nbsp; Your saftey suit
contains a pager.&nbsp; It will vibrate when Mr. Adams is
ready for you, his office is on the top floor.&nbsp; Lifts
are down the hall."

Debbie smiled at the receptionist and headed for the
lifts.&nbsp; After a rather long wait the lift door opened.
Debbie was suprised to find KSD Enterprises had lift
attendants.

"Which floor would you like maam?"

"I'm going to the hospitality area on the 30th floor."

"Right you are maam.&nbsp; Lifts are running a bit slow
today maam but don't worry."&nbsp; The doors closed.

"Maam, I've noticed your saftey suit is not quite on
right.&nbsp; Let me help you adjust it."

Debbie took a step back and felt a sense of panic as
the lift attendant put out his hands towards here.

"It's OK maam, don't worry I'm trained to do this.&nbsp; The
saftey suit must be adjusted to give you proper
protection."

Well, it sounded like a plausible explanation so she
let the attendant turn her around and he stood behind
her back and reached around.&nbsp; He started picking at
the top of the corset just above her breasts adjusting
the way it sat.&nbsp; Debbie noticed the elevator was indeed
quite slow and after what seemed like a half a minute
they were still only passing the 5th floor.

Debbie was about to stop the attendant after he'd been
fiddling for what must have been over a minute.

"Oh dear maam.&nbsp; They seem to have given you the wrong
size.&nbsp; That will never to.&nbsp; It won't be right
otherwise."

Debbie was kinda disheartened at having to go spend
another few minutes in the lift getting back down to
reception, getting redressed and going up with the
sleazy lift attendant again.

"Listen it's OK, I know how I can solve this without
you getting another suit.&nbsp; I can just jiggle you a bit
and make the suit fit."

Debbie's eyes with wide with astonishment.&nbsp; He was
going to do _what_ ?&nbsp; She was about to slap the lift
attendant when he pulled out a his wallet and showed
her a card.&nbsp; It said 'licensed saftey suit adjustor'.

She was rather astoninshed and in her bewilderment just
stood there while the lift attendant took her full
breasts in his hands and bounced them up and down for
the rest of the ride.

"Thirtieth floor maam."

The doors opened and the lift person just stood there
in his lift person uniform looking just like everything
was normal.&nbsp; Debbie walked slowly to the hospitaility
area trying to comprehend what was happening.

=======================================================

Debbie entered the hospitality room.&nbsp; The girl at the
hospitality reception jumped up to intercept her.

"Hi there, are you a visitor?&nbsp; You don't have your
visitors pass on."

"Oh yes."&nbsp; The saftey suit had distracted Debbie and
she forget that the girl at the main reception hadn't
given her a pass.&nbsp; "I forget to take one."

"Don't worry," chirped the girl, "I can give you one
here."

The receptionist girl hapilly skipped back to her
desk and brought out a studded leather collar.&nbsp; She
skipped back to where Debbie stood and started to put
the collar on her.

"What the hell is that!" she exclaimed.

"It's a visitors pass.&nbsp; It just a security device that
lets you in parts of the building with the security
guards being alerted."

"But, but, but it's a dogs collar!"

"Oh we're just trying these out.&nbsp; They're more
fashionable then the boring old security tags and
easier to see."

"That just doesn't seem right."

The receptionist pointed over to another couple of
people across the room who clearly looked like visitors
coming for a business meeting and they too were wearing
the same visitors passes.

Debbie thought about leaving but figured she needed the
job and the collar wasn't that freaky.&nbsp; She nodded 'OK'
and let the hospitality girl put the collar around her
neck.

"Make yourself at home here, we've tried to create a
pleasant environment where our guests can relax.
There are plenty of things to keep you entertained
while you wait.&nbsp; I'm your hostess for today.&nbsp; If there
is _anything you need please don't hesitate to ask."

Debbie frowned at the way the girl had said 'anything'
wondering if she had put some hidden meaning behind it.

=======================================================

The hospitality room was a large area in the corner
of the tall skyscraper.&nbsp; The walls were made of glass
and it was possible to see out over the city.&nbsp; A few
half cubicles were placed around the outside and a
number of activity tables.&nbsp; There was a bar and snack
shop on one side and tables and chairs in the center.
Debbie went over to the bar to get a drink to calm her
nerves.

"I'll have a large gin and tonic, please."

The waiter quickly mixed her drink and poured it into
a funny looking device before placing it in front of
her.

"What's that strange thing?" asked Debbie.

"It's a new type of cup.&nbsp; We'll all be using them one
day.&nbsp; There's no spillage and it leaves both your hands
free to have other things done to th... err to do
other things."

Debbie frowned at the barman.

"Here I'll show you."&nbsp; The barman took another 'cup'
and filled it with water.&nbsp; "Musn't be drinking on the
job eh?" he winked.&nbsp; The device consisted of a
cylindrical canister which held the drink.&nbsp; A tube
extended from the lid and ended in a rubber ball with
straps on.

The barman put the rubber ball in his mouth and tied
the straps behind his head.&nbsp; He pushed a button on the
canister and stood there smiling at Debbie drinking his
water.&nbsp; He waved his hands around showing that indeed
he had use of both of his hands.

Debbie looked at the barman and although he looked
kinda ridiculous she could see some advantage in the
new type of cup.&nbsp; She remembered all those times she
when she was studying at university and she could have
been writing notes instead of having to pick her mug
up for a drink.&nbsp; She remembered all those times when
she wanted some liquid refreshment while having sex.

The barman had drunk all the water and started going
about his business still with the cup attached.

Debbie inserted the rubber ball into her mouth and
did the straps up.&nbsp; She nervously pressed the button
on the canister.&nbsp; As the button pressed down she heard
a click on the straps behind her head and the locked
shut.&nbsp; Next the rubber ball started to inflate sealing
it into her mouth.

Then the liquid started pumping into her mouth.&nbsp; At
first Debbie didn't want to drink.&nbsp; It felt so weird.
She realized there was nothing she could do about it so
she swallowed the liquid.&nbsp; The gin and tonic was being
pumped into her mouth at a managable slow, but firm
rate.&nbsp; She couldn't do anything to stop the liquid or
speed it up.

After half the canister had emptied Debbie felt she
had enough, but the canister kept pumping.&nbsp; Debbie
fought to contol her gag reflex as the liquid was
pumped down her throat.&nbsp; Her face turned red and she
caught the barmans attention pleading with her eyes for
help.&nbsp; The barman just smiled.

When Debbie had drunk all her drink the rubber ball
deflated and the straps unclipped.&nbsp; She was glad to
get the 'cup' off her.&nbsp; She looked for the barman to
complain to him, but he was gone.

=======================================================

Debbie sat down at one of the tables for a minute to
recover from the drink.&nbsp; Just as she had regianed her
composure Debbies's pager went off.&nbsp; The pager was
built into the saftey suit.&nbsp; The device was sewn into
the gusset of the corset and pressed up against her
clit.

Debbie jumped up in fright at her crotch being
violated and entertained the hospitality staff by
dancing round while trying to bat away the pager.&nbsp; The
first girl came back and explained that it was the
pager and it was time for her interview.&nbsp; Debbie
felt more relaxed now that she there was a proper
explanation of what was happening.&nbsp; The pager had
stopped anyway.

Debbie sat down to catch her breath.&nbsp; The hospitality
girl went back to her desk.&nbsp; Debbie headed for the
lift.

She was alone again with the lift attendant but this
time he ignored her.&nbsp; She stood away at the back of
the lift and he stood at the front, facing the door.

The pager went off again.

Debbie tried to stand still but the vibrations with
working their magic on her clit and she started to
squirm around.&nbsp; She noticed the lift was going up far
too slowly.&nbsp; They had only gone up 2 floors and there
were 25 more to go.

She squirmed to try and get away from the vibrating
pager but it was no use.&nbsp; She wondered if the lift
attendant had noticed.&nbsp; After another couple of floors
Debbie decided to stand still incase the lift man
noticed her fidgeting.

After a few more floors Debbie noticed she was getting
very wet and she was sure the lift man could smell
something was up.&nbsp; Her face was becoming flushed and
she desperatly needed to get out of the lift.

Fortunatly the lift only took 3 minutes to reach the
top floor and by then Debbie was only slightly a mess.
Her hair was sweaty and she worried about making a
damp patch when she sat down.

Debbie was relieved to get out when Ann, Mr Adams
personal assisstant came out to meet her.

"Hello Mr Larson, welcome.&nbsp; I'm Ann, Mr Adamas
assistant.&nbsp; Mr Adams is ready to see you.&nbsp; Please
take your shoes off.&nbsp; We are just like the Japanese
here and wear indoor shoes inside."

Debbie removed her shoes and Ann handed her a pair of
rubber slippers.&nbsp; She put them on and buckled them
up.&nbsp; She noticed the catches on them were the same as
the ones on her saftey corset and she couldn't remove
them either.

Debbie was shown through to Sean's office.
