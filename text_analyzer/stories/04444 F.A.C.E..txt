Feminists Against Capitalism and
Exploitation

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The four men stared out of the window at
the house opposite.� It was a tall
three-story one in the centre of a terrace.�
Once it had been grand and imposing but was now extremely run-down.� The paintwork was peeling,
the garden was full of weeds and blankets hung in place of curtains over the
windows.� On the door a crude
hand-written sign had been pinned: �Headquarters of FACE.�� FACE, the men knew, stood for Feminists Against Capitalism and Exploitation.� They also knew �headquarters� was a far more
impressive word than the house deserved.�
It was just a squat, a filthy and disreputable tip which brought down
the house prices in the whole street.�
And the four girls who squatted there were noisy, disgusting troublemakers.� The names of the four were written on slips
of paper lying in a hat on the table beside the watching men.� Each of them now solemnly drew out a name.� Wayne picked Laisa, Steve got Mel, Parveena was assigned to Neil and the
final one, Ariane, fell to Martin.

�Remember,� Steve said.� �It�s not enough just to beat �em.� We�ve got to turn �em completely.�

Each of them nodded.� �First one wins,� Neil said.

�First one wins.�

&nbsp;

Parveena bent over the cooker and sniffed
at a large saucepan.� She tasted the
lentil stew bubbled away in there and added a little more turmeric.� Checking the time, she turned the rice
on.� Parveena did most of the cooking for
the squat, as well as the washing up and the cleaning.� �The woman of the house,� she sometimes called
herself, although never with bitterness.�
After all, she didn�t really mind her chores.� She was a small, slender Indonesian girl with
tapering eyes, an oval face and a button nose.�
Her black straight hair was cut short and she wore an androgynous tee-shirt
and jeans, but her dress sense was less strident than her house-mates.� She was overall less assertive than they
were, less gifted and not very bright.�
She rarely thought for herself and had only drifted into the women�s
movement through the influence of others.�
The way she saw it, she could help it best in a support role.� She couldn�t do what Ariane did, for
example.� Ariane was huddled over the
kitchen table, writing.� She was always
writing something; articles, pamphlets, protest letters, campaign leaflets, all
in support of the cause.� Parveena
thought that Ariane was a genius.� The
Iranian girl could have been anything; she had the brains and the looks, with a
tall, curvaceous figure, olive skin and large, soft eyes.� But she had turned her back on it all to
fight patriarchy.� Her black hair was
shaved around the back and sides and arranged at the top in a fearsome cluster
of spikes.� Her body was invariably
hidden by baggy blouses and long skirts which once boasted psychedelic colours
but now, having never been washed, were just grubby.� Finally she put her pen down, leant back and
passed her work to Parveena for inspection.

�What you think?� she smiled.

Parveena scanned the document.� �FACE demands an end to the sexist
degradation of women in�� �It�s great,� she said enthusiastically.� �As usual.�

�I go to printers tomorrow,� she said in
her heavily accented voice.� Ariane still
struggled with spoken English but her command of the written tongue was
impeccable.� �You think I get right� er,
right tone?�

�Of course you did, Ariane.� You always do.�

Just then the front door slammed
shut.� A second later Mel and Laisa burst
into the kitchen, both flushed, excited and clutching armfuls of leaflets.

�Do we fuckin� rule or what?� Laisa cried
with a huge grin.

�Did it go well?� Parveena asked.

�Fuckin� A.� Really good response, wasn�t
it Mel?�

�Got loads of sisters thinking,� Mel
confirmed.

�A bit of hassle from the usual scum but we soon saw �em off.�

Parveena could well believe it.� They made a formidable pair.� Laisa was tall and extremely bulky, with an
immense bosom and backside.� Her arms and
legs were also like tree-trunks, although her contours were part-hidden by the
baggy dungarees and polo-necked jumper she wore.� Her parents were Jamaican and she celebrated
her heritage with a great cluster of long, fetid dreadlocks, together with some
Rastafarian badges alongside her feminist ones.�
Mel was shorter and even stouter, almost as
broad as she was tall.� With at least
three chins wobbling underneath her oval face, small close-set eyes and hair
shaved into a crew-cut, she was no beauty and happy not to be.� Her podgy arms protruded out of an old
tee-shirt and she wore jeans held up by braces.�
The pair were the heart of the squat, filling
it with their loud talk and laughter.�
Yet they could be truly fearsome when aroused.� They were the front-line troops, the ones who
led meetings, stormed barricades at demonstrations and � as they had been doing
today � hectored indifferent or hostile shoppers.� Both held criminal records and nothing could
daunt them.

As Mel sat beside Ariane to nibble at her
ear and Laisa wrapped her strong arms around Parveena, the Indonesian girl
reflected how well the house worked.�
Despite their different backgrounds � Mel was the only white
Englishwoman amongst them � they had been together for two years and showed no
signs of parting.� It was due to their
clearly recognised boundaries.� Each had
their own role, kept to it and respected that of the others.� They were complimenting character types �
boisterous Laisa, slightly more aggressive Mel, meek Parveena and studious
Ariane.� Likewise, their intimate
relationships were stable and acknowledged.�
Parveena and Laisa were lovers, as were Ariane and Mel; none of them
tried to change that.� These factors
helped keep them all together.� That and their passion for the cause, of course.

Over dinner Mel and Laisa regaled the
other two with tales of their triumphs of the day.� As usual they took more apparent pleasure
from vanquishing their opponents � usually groups of boorish young men � than
from converting their allies.� Parveena
personally thought their approach was too extreme but would never dare tell
them so, or take their place.� Afterwards
they all collapsed on the sofa to watch their cheap portable telly.� They lived on welfare cheques and so lived
extremely frugally.� Mel and Laisa hooted
at the sexist clich�s of the programmes while Ariane took occasional notes,
possibly for use in a later article.�
Eventually the two couples went to bed.�
As it happened, neither made love that night.� Parveena and Laisa simply lay in one another�s
arms; and in their double bed in the room next door, Mel and Ariane were doing
likewise.� Yet if they knew what was
about to befall them, they probably would have made love with all their
strength.

In the very depths of the night, a figure
picked the old lock on the front door and stepped into the hall.� After gently shutting the door behind him he
crept silently upstairs.� In the first
room he stole into, he could just detect two bodies wrapped tightly together on
the bed.� One was snoring loudly, the
other breathed gently but deeply.� The
figure reached into the bag he was carrying and produced a hypodermic
needle.� He filled it from a small bottle
and tiptoed towards the bed.� Ever so
gently, he pushed the needle into Laisa�s thick forearm.� The black woman grunted slightly but remained
asleep.� The intruder refilled the needle
and this time inserted it into Parveena�s arm.�
He waited a few minutes.� Then he
tentatively checked that the sedative had worked, gentle slapping each feminist�s
face and shaking them.� Neither gave a
response.� The man stole out of the room
and into the one next door.� One by one
and with the same care, he injected Mel and Ariane with the sedative.

Finally he pulled the blanket covering
the window aside and looked out onto the street.� He produced a torch and flashed it three
times.� Two cars drove around the corner
and stopped outside the squat.� Three men
got out, entered the house and man upstairs.�
They carefully separated Mel from Ariane�s arms and rolled the white
woman up into the duvet.� One holding her
feet and the other her head, they lifted her up, grunted in protest at the
weight and carried her downstairs.� The oblivious
feminist was transported out of the house and put on the floor at the back of
one car.� Meanwhile the other two men
were wrapping Ariane up in the bed sheet.�
She was also hauled out and lain on top of her
comatose lover.� Laisa and Parveena were removed
from the house in the same manner, wrapped up and placed in the other car.� Finally the front door of the squat was
closed and the men drove off with their captives.

Parveena awoke, although only
slowly.� Her mind was immensely slow and
groggy and for a long time she hung in a semi-conscious hinterland.� Gradually she became alert enough to wonder
about her stupefied condition, and about the aches which seemed to be
afflicting all parts of her body.� She
tried thinking back to last night but it was an effort, and she found no memory
which could explain her state.� It had
been a quiet evening in and then up to bed with Laisa � hadn�t it?� Finally Parveena was able to notice two
important facts.� She was not lying in
bed with Laisa.� She was not lying
anywhere; she seemed to be stood against what felt like a brick wall.� And she could not move.� Her wrists, ankles and waist were enclosed by
sharp metal objects which were pinning her to the wall.� Try as she might, she could not break
them.� But those around her wrists
yielded just a little and gave the clink of chains.

Fear took hold of Parveena, pushing her
fatigue aside.� What had happened last
night?� Her housemates weren�t the sort
to play practical jokes, certainly not ones like this.� The word �kidnapped� stole into her terrified
mind.� The solid dark enclosing her
increased her panic; she could see no more with her eyes open than with them
closed.� She tried to scream but only a
muffled grunt came out.� Then she
realised that her mouth was covered with a tight strip, made of a material
which tasted like rubber.� In fact, she
became aware of a similar substance covering most of her body.� The tiny movements she was capable of �
flexing her shoulders, rubbing her chin on her arm � produced a slight squeaking
noise and the sensation of pressing against a tight outer skin.� Her sense of unreality grew.� Was it possible that she was dreaming-

There was light.� Parveena gasped at the suddenness of it, then desperately craned her head around.� She was in a tiny, utterly unfamiliar bricked
cellar.� Metal bands were holding her in
place, those around her wrists and arms attached to short chains and the thick
one around her waist buried straight into the wall.� And her body was indeed encased in rubber, a
black latex catsuit which covered her torso and limbs.� Though she could not see this far, it
stretched over the top of her head as well.�
Only her backside was exposed, two brown orbs protruding shamefully
naked from the suit.� Parveena had seen
such costumes before, in pornographic magazines which her housemates would
sometimes steal and ritually burn.� Never
in her worst nightmares had she imagined she would be in such a suit, in such a
posture.� And it was getting worst.

Descending the stairs was a bearded,
thick-set white man.� Parveena vaguely
recognised him.� He was one of their
neighbours who made constant and odious objections to their presence.� He stopped and stared in silence at her for a
while, meeting her petrified gaze with a n expression
of total disdain.� Parveena was no longer
under any illusions.� She had been
kidnapped.� Her
first through was to wonder what had befallen her housemates, especially
Laisa.� Her next was even more terrifying
� what this man planned to do to her.

�You�re awake then,� he finally said in a
neutral tone.� �Right.� My name�s Neil.� Bu when I remove that gag, which won�t be for
a long time yet, you�ll call me �Master.��
That�ll be your first word.� It�ll
be the only one you ever say again without my permission.� Master. �And you�ll have to mean it from the bottom of
your heart.� Because that�s the only way
you�ll get out of here.� Otherwise you�ll
stay.� And you�ll get this every single
day.�

Neil reached into a small cupboard behind
him and produced a long willow cane.� As
he advanced on the imprisoned feminist her screams grew louder and lower � but
only inside her head.� They filtered
through the leather gag as impotent muffled grunts, barely audible to Neil let
alone anybody outside the room.� Parveena
continued making them though, and her efforts were redoubled a second
later.� The cane whistled through the air
and fell savagely across her exposed cheeks.�
She couldn�t remember ever experiencing pain like it.� It was a thin line of fire which lit up her
whole backside and coursed through her body.�
It was simply unendurable.� She
had endured spankings as a child but none could compare to the sheer intensity
of the touch of the cane.� And the agony
of the first stroke was still engulfing her when the second came.� Neil had aimed it expertly to land parallel
to and an inch above the first.� Parveena
was unaware of the positioning; she only knew the agony it brought.� The fire returned with even greater strength
than before, merging with the first wave to consume her.� A third and fourth stroke followed quickly,
each following the same careful pattern.�
Parveena�s head rocked back and forth, her gloved fingers clenched and
unclenched; the only movement she was capable of.� The terrible feeling was worst because she
could do nothing to relieve it.� She
longed to rub her increasingly sore buttocks but the chains around her wrists
held her tight. Sweat broke out across her body, trapped by her tight leather
suit.� It ran freely down her brow
though, mixing with the tears squeezed through her tightly shut lids.� And then the fifth stroke came.� Neil had readjusted his grip and aimed the
willow at the four parallel weals running across Parveena�s skin.� It landed across all and their fire exploded
back into life.� The Indonesian girl had
thought it was impossible for the burning to grow more savage.� She was proved wrong.� Amidst the red clouds filling her brain her
one coherent thought was: how much longer?

A long while yet.� Ten minutes later, the weals on her cheeks
numbered twenty five.� All fell in the
same gated clusters.� Neil had given her
five across her left orb, five over her right and the remainder shared between
the two.� He was very skilled in this
perverse art and each cluster was extremely neat.� If the whole of the feminist�s ass was
glowing red that was due to the cumulative effect of the strokes, not any going
astray.� His victim was, as far as it was
possible to tell, hanging limp in her bonds.�
Neil briefly wondered if she was becoming inured to the cane.

In truth, no such thing had
happened.� Parveena had become so
overwhelmed by the pain that she couldn�t properly respond to it anymore.� It filled every part of her body and seemed
an integral part of her.� It was so great
that each time the cane landed again, it scarcely made a difference.� All she could think was: there, it�s come
again.� And again and again; and
unbeknown to her, the lines on her buttocks now numbered thirty.� She was heedless of anything else, whether
the cellar, her bonds, the tight leather suit, the gag in her mouth.� Her world was simply one of pain.� At the very edge of her consciousness,
thought, she was aware of one word.� Master.� She knew she
had to say it to stop the pain.� And she
knew she must not, although for reasons she could barely remember.

Rough hands suddenly gripped her
head.� The ball was pulled from her
mouth.� She gasped in shock, briefly
feeling that part of her body had been amputated.� She could scream, she could should � and yet,
still no sound would come from her lips beyond a heavy pant.� Her eyes were still screwed up in agony but
she heard a voice say,

�What do you call me?�

For a very long time Parveena struggled
to find words.� They had to be dragged up
from a very long way, from far beneath the deep red layer.� Finally she found the right one and whispered
it in the softest of voices.

�Bastard.�

Her jaw was gripped and held open.� The ball gag was roughly pushed back into her
mouth and fastened in place.� A leather
hood was rolled over her head.� It
covered it completely and clung to every bump and hollow.� The only gap in the leather was two tiny
holes for her nostrils.� Another leather
casing was held over her buttocks and she heard a zip being fastened.� When it was in place the cool air of the
cellar, her one tiny morsel of comfort, was gone.� Every inch of her body was covered.� She could not see, could not speak and could
not move.� She heard the sound of
footsteps receding and the blackness grew just a little deeper as the light was
switched out.� The Indonesian feminist
was left in the cellar, alone with her agony.

The screen showed a picture of a young
naked girl.� A second later the paddle
landed on Mel�s buttocks with an echoing crack.�
Steve leant over to push another button on his computer.� The picture changed, this time displaying a
naked man.� The paddle in Steve�s hand
remained raised.� A fresh image appeared:
two women clothed but kissing.� Down came
the paddle again, making Mel�s obese buttocks dance and jiggle.� The next slide was of a man entering a woman
from behind.� Mel was spared.

It was another cellar.� Mel was laying on
her belly on top of a long, thin bench.�
Thick cords lashed her wrists and ankles to the bench legs.� She was completely naked.� Directly in front of her was a large screen;
behind her was a computer-generated projector and, of course, Steve.� The feminist had been crudely gagged with a
handkerchief.� Her buttocks were bright
scarlet; her face was creased in agony and tears were streaming down her
cheeks.� She had strained against her
bonds until she realised the futility and her strength fled.� She had also tried not to watch the
unrelenting series of images in front of her.�
That was also impossible, for whenever Steve caught her turning her head
away or even closing her eyes he gave her an especially hard blow.� So far the ordeal had lasted half an
hour.� The pattern had been incessant � a
feminine image was followed by a blow, a masculine one by a reprieve.� Mel knew what her torturer was trying to
do.� But she didn�t know how to stop
him.� All she could do was desperately
hang on, resist the unsubtle brainwashing, wonder how many pictures were left
and pray it would be over soon.

Three young women in dungarees on a
demonstration march.� Slap! went the paddle.� A man standing over a cowering naked girl and gripping her dog
collar.� A
close-up of a vagina.� Crack!� A harlot sucking a man�s
penis.

Steve readjusted his grip on the paddle
in readiness and pressed Enter again.� He
knew there were thousands of slides left, downloaded from the Internet and
painstakingly collated by him.� And he
knew that Mel � God how the sight of her blubbery white body revolted him � had
barely started her education.

�Now concentrate.� Concentrate.�
Follow the pendant.� The pendant.� Follow
the pendant.�

The pendant in question was a small
golden droplet on a chain.� Martin swung
it on one finger, back and forth, back and forth.� Ariane did all she could to stop herself, but
gradually she began to follow it with her eyes.

It was no ordinary hypnotism.� Ariane�s very eyelids were being held; Martin
was leaning over her and forcing them to stay open with his other hand.� Virtually every other part of her body was
already immobilised.� She was sat in a
chair which had fitted metal bands around her arms and legs and a thicker one
encasing her waist.� Her head was fixed
in a clamp which fastened around the sides and attached to the chair�s
headrest; and she was gagged by a cloth.�
She was still dressed in the nightie she was wearing when she was
drugged, taken from her home and brought to this bedroom.

�Follow the pendant.� Follow the pendant.�� Martin repeated the sentence over and over
again.� He had a deep, rhythmic voice and
his words were as absorbing as a heartbeat.�
Ariane tried to shut them out.�
She tried to not do what they instructed.� But it was impossible.� Still the glittering pendent swung back and
forth.� Slowly everything else was
melting away and it was the only thing left in the room.

Martin watched her carefully.� Finally he moved the pendent away and
released Ariane�s eyelids.� Her
expression didn�t change and her wide eyes continued staring into nothing.� Carefully he unfastened the various bonds
which held her.� Still no reaction came.

�Can you hear me?� he breathed in her ear.

�Yes.��
Her voice was dull and flat.

�Listen to me carefully.�� He hesitated.�
The others had been suspicious of this method.� And it was true, if he told Ariane to call
him Master now, she would comply instantly.�
That wasn�t the point of the game, however.� There had to be a permanent change, effected
by breaking their will.� �You will do
everything I tell you.� Everything.� Do you
understand?�

�Yes.�

�Stand up.� Walk over to the bed.� Now lie face down on it.� Do not move.�
Do not move an inch until I say so.�
Whatever happens.�� Martin lifted Ariane�s nightie to expose her
slender, muscular buttocks.� He picked up
a heavy wooden paddle which had metal studs fastened into it.� �You are about to feel a lot of pain,� he
continued.� �When you wake up, you�ll
remember the pain.� And you�ll remember
that you deserved it.� What will you
remember?�

�I deserved the pain,� Ariane
echoed.

Martin nodded.� He brought the paddle across Ariane�s
backside, the first of many, many blows.

�You bastard!� Let me go you fucking � aaaargh!�

Laisa let off another deafening scream as
a fresh bolt of agony coursed through her backside.� Her whole body threshed wildly, her fat legs
flailing, her toes hammering the ground, her head shaking back and forth.� Trying to utilise the charge which the pain
gave her, she made another attempt at escape.�
She tried to rise, roll, do anything to propel
herself away.� But it was futile; and as
a reward, Wayne gave her an especially savage blow.�
The agony of it knocked Laisa almost insensible for a moment.� She was scarcely aware of the heart-rending
squeal she gave, face contorted and saliva splaying out through her thick,
twitching lips.� Her body convulsed
again, but it was only able to move so much.

Laisa was lying face down on the floor of
a basement lit by a single bulb.� She was
naked except for a pair of tight black leather high-heeled boots which rose up
to her knees.� Cuffs were fixed to the
boots and they were chained closer together.�
Tight leather cords were tied around the black feminist�s thighs,
holding them together and biting into the acres of dark flab.� More cuffs chained her arms behind her back;
and cords fixed to them stretched up her spine to a dog collar around her thick
neck.� She had awoken in that position
half an hour ago.� Watching her had been Wayne, holding a
leather whip.� As soon as he saw Laisa�s
eyes open he had walked over to her, put the boot on the small of her back and
begun.� The attentions of the whip had
already turned Laisa�s broad chocolate ass into a glowing expanse decorated
with long, bright scarlet lines.� She
could not see the sight but was certainly aware of the feeling.� Several times in the past her activities for
the �cause� had caused her to be attacked and beaten up.� Nothing had been anywhere near as bad as
this.� The intensity of the pain
threatened to consume her, to take over her mind and body entirely.� It was unrelenting, the level of agony never
dipping.� And far too quickly, it was
increased by another stroke.� Just as she
thought the last crack of fire was the worst possible, a new one landed and
proved her wrong.� Several times already
she had come close to breaking down completely.�
She wanted to surrender, to plead with her tormentor for mercy.� Anything to end the pain.� But she just held onto her pride and managed
to put all her quickly-departing strength into fighting and cursing him.

�Oh God, oh Jesus, let me go you fucking sick
bastard!� I�ll fucking kill-�

The now-familiar sequence of noises began
again.� The whoosh of
the whip through the air.� The
resounding crack as it landed on Laisa�s cheeks.� The piercing scream from
the black feminist.� It was
repeated time after time.� Wayne gradually
increased the force until his own arm began to ache, never mind Laisa�s
backside.� There was no virgin territory
left beneath him; each time now the whip was curling across scores of red
weal.� For variety he sometimes directed
it against the back of her thick thighs.�
The angle wasn�t perfect, however, and he always returned to the more
satisfactory target of her cheeks.� Many
blows later, he noticed with glee that although her convulsive twitching
continued, her struggles were dying away.�
Her screams were decreasing in force too and her curses had been
replaced by loud, keening wails.� He sent
the whip curling over her ample waist several times and then, for good measure,
twice across her shoulder plaids.� Each
time she gave an agonised grunt and her whole body shook, sending the cellulite
rippling.� But she made no other
response.

Wayne put the whip down, massaged his aching shoulders and bend down in
front of his prey.� For a few minutes she
remained insensible.� Tears pushed
through her screwed up eyelids, thick lips were stretched in a fearful grimace,
the oval face was stretched and lined.� Then her eyes snapped open.� She spat feebly at Wayne and began to
snarl, weakly but with venom,

�You can whip me.�
You can rape me,�
But you can�t beat me.� You
can whip me-�

�That�s certainly true.�� Re-energised, he leapt to his feet and took
hold of the cord linking Laisa�s dog collar to her cuffs.� With some difficulty, he pulled her o his
feet.� �Never thought I�d hear a fat
nigger dyke like you talking such sense,� he grunted as he pushed her across
the cellar.� The journey ended with her
being slammed heavily across some wooden bars which climbed up one wall.

�Bastard!� You can whip me but you can�t beat me.� You can-�

�Oh, I can do a lot more.�� Wayne pressed one elbow into the small of the struggling feminist�s back,
pinning her to the wall.� He unfastened
her hands.� After stunning her with a
swift, savage blow to the kidneys, he stretched her arms out and lashed her to
the bars.� Then he unfastened her ankles,
spread her legs far apart and also knotted the cords attached to her leg cuffs
to wall bars.� �You wait and see what I
can do to you, nigger,� he murmured in the helpless feminist�s ear.� �I�ve hardly started yet.�

Through her terror and agony, Laisa felt Wayne�s rough hands
reach around her body and grip one of her pendulous breasts.� Her futile struggles increased as he pulled
it backwards.� Then a small but intense
bolt of pain stabbed at her nipple.� She
desperately craned her head round and saw that a small metal clamp was attached
to the chocolate bud, its sharp teeth digging cruelly into the flesh.� Yet another cord hung from the clamp.� Laisa gave a little whimper as Wayne pulled the
cord sideways, dragging her breast with it.�
He fastened the cord to a bar so that her breast was stretched out at
right angles to her body; and the bite of the clamp was added to the red throb
still coursing through her.� Too spent to
begin cursing her tormentor again, the black feminist could only wait as her
other nipple was clamped and her right breast was stretched far out in the
other direction.� Then she gave a loud
gasp and her eyes opened wide.� Another
cruel, indescribably cruel, row of metal teeth had bitten into her vagina
lips.� She wept as the pain coursed
through her like quicksilver, spreading from the area which normally gave her
ecstasy.� It was terrible enough to begin
with, but it increased even further as Wayne dragged the
clamp back and upwards between her buttocks.�
He pulled the clamp�s cord between her red-striped orbs, up her back and
fastened it to her dog collar.� She was
forced to push her head back as far as she could until her wide eyes were
staring at the ceiling.� Even then, the
collar was slightly choking her and the clamp was almost tearing her vagina
lips.

And there the fearsome black feminist
stood, naked and utterly trapped, the aches from her whipping barely faded and
joined by fresh stabs of pain from her most intimate areas.� There she stood as Wayne picked up a
heavy wooden paddle studded with metal and began again.

Time after time the pattern was
repeated.� Wayne swung as hard
as he could, the paddle slammed into one of her buttocks, the flesh danced and
jiggled for a second, and while it did Laisa screamed deafeningly.� Time after time after time.� Even Wayne wasn�t sure
how long this part lasted.� He wasn�t
counting minutes or strokes.� It would
last as long as he wished and his only concern was to deal out as much
punishment as he could.� And he could
deal out so much.� The red weals on Laisa�s
backside gradually almost vanished as the whole rotund expanse of flesh became
a blend of bright scarlet and gathering purple bruises.� To even breath on it seemed a cruelty � and
still he brought the paddle down on it with his whole strength.� As for Laisa, her sense not only of time but
of her place, her nakedness, her captivity, even her tormentor faded away.� Her only reality was an all-embracing, sharp
world of unrelenting agony.� She
screamed, wailed, blubbered, even pleaded for mercy towards the end and was
unconscious of it all.� The enveloping
ache from her buttocks, the sudden extra stabs as the paddle landed again and
again, the slight increase to the already unbearable fire each one brought �
that was all she knew.� She was hardly
even aware when the paddle began landing with a slightly sharper slap and the
fire leapt from her thighs instead of her backside. The whole of the lower part
of its body felt stripped of its skin.�
She couldn�t distinguish between the sources of her suffering any
longer.

Wayne was actually a little more sparing towards Laisa�s thighs.� He steadily worked his way down the blubbery
trunks, alternating between left and right.�
Soon the chocolate skin was glowing a dull red
all the way down to the knees, but he left it at that.� Finally he gave half a dozen more blows
across the multi-coloured mass of the buttocks.�
They were especially savage, and Laisa accompanied each one with a
particularly loud squeal.� Then Wayne put the
paddle down.� He watched the imprisoned
black feminist for a few moments.� She
shuddered, blubbered, twitched helplessly in her bonds.� Her breath came out in rapid pants and her
head shook slightly from side to side, allowing him brief glimpses of her
contorted, tear-stained face.� He
unfastened the cord from her genital clamp.�
Her head snapped forward, but again the overall agony was so intense
that she barely registered this slight mitigation.� Nor did she notice her breasts being untied
from the walls, releasing the mounds to spring back to their natural positions.� She even didn�t notice her arms and legs
being untied from the bars and retied together, he former behind her back.

But then Wayne tossed her
dog collar leash over a higher wall bar and caught the end again.� And he began to pull.� He had to use all his strength, fighting
against the dead weight of the feminist�s bulk.�
For a few seconds he struggled to make any impression.� Gradually, though, Laisa was lifted off her
feet.� She felt the collar tightening
around her neck, choking off her air supply.�
That was sharp enough to cut through the pain of the beating.� Panic and then terror built inside her as she
struggled to breath.� Wayne inexorably
pulled her higher into the air.� Truly
desperate now, Laisa swung her body back and forth, strained at her bonds,
tried to cry out; but there was nothing she could do.� She could not breath.� The darkness of the cellar began to swim
around her.� Her mouth swung open and her
tongue flopped out.� The panting of her
breath turned into frantic, stentorian gasps, but it was not enough.� As her wide eyes began to almost pop out of
her sockets, her ebony face turned a deep purple shade.� Her body was almost still again now, except
for a feeble kicking of her heels in thin air.�
Her head flopped back and she stared wildly into nothing.� She felt consciousness start to slip away
from her�

And then without warning, Wayne let go of the
cord.� Laisa dropped nearly a foot and
landed heavily in a huddle on the cellar floor.�
Her great frame thrashed about, the bound legs kicking spasmodically.� Wayne caught a glimpse of her contorted features and saw that the collar
was still too tight.� He pressed his foot
on her breastplate, reached down and tugged it a little looser.� Desperate, racking breaths began passing
through Laisa�s body.� Wayne kept his foot
where it was, pinning his captive to the floor.�
He gazed dispassionately down at the black feminist, her lolling tongue,
her fat, twisted face, her wide and petrified eyes.� After a few minutes just a little composure
returned to her.� And almost immediately
she made a little attempt to escape, just an extra squirm of her body.� It was pitiable and of course completely
futile, but it was there.� It wasn�t time
yet.

�Eventually,� he announced flatly, �You
will call me master.�

Laisa�s lips trembled.� Terror still filling her from the
near-hanging fought with the returning agony from her buttocks.� Mixed in there was just a flicker of
defiance.� �Y-y-y-b-b-�

�Not yet, I know.�� With that, Wayne pulled down
his trousers to reveal his stiffly erect penis.�
He took hold of the leash attached to Laisa�s collar and pulled it hard
again.� The leather closed around her
windpipe once more and her jaw dropped open in a frantic search for air.� Wayne directed his rod downwards, into her mouth.� A second later a powerful stream of urine
shot out.� Laisa coughed and retched.� She tried frantically to spit the golden
liquid out but it was shooting in too quickly for her to manage.� Some bubbled across her thick lips and over
her cheeks, a little bubbled out of her nose but most went straight down her
throat.� Finally she had the foresight to
turn her head away.� Wayne let go of the
least and simply continued to urinate over the black feminist�s head, across
her screwed up eyes and into her flapping dreadlocks.� The stream eventually ran dry and Wayne shook the
last few drops out over his captive.� As
Laisa continued feebly coughing out the remnants of the liquid, all of it
splashing on her face, Wayne took his foot off her and tied her leas to the wall bars.� Then he grabbed hold of her jaw, shoved a
handkerchief in her mouth to gag her and tied it around her head.� Finally he walked out of the cellar.� The black feminist huddled by the wall,
naked, bound and helpless in the dark.

Over the next few mornings, Laisa came to
know the follow routine.� After a few
hours of nightmare-haunted sleep she awoke on the cellar floor.� The stiffness induced by her posture � for
her arms were always tied behind her back � and the dull ache from the nipple
and genital clamps which were never removed quickly became supplanted by
incessant pain from her backside, back and thighs.� She lay helplessly for up to an hour.� Then Wayne would enter
the cellar and perform his morning ablutions.�
He urinated and defecated over Laisa�s face.� There was no longer any attempt to make her
swallow it; he simply let the substances splatter over her skin and hair.� He also never allowed Laisa to wash any of it
off.� Her face was left covered with
faeces, and only the next stream of urine a few hours later rinsed some of it
off.� It was never enough, however.� Her face became caked with the foul
substance, an extra brown mask above her own chocolate skin.� It worked its way into every fold and every
wrinkle, slowly becoming absorbed into her pores.� Meanwhile her dreadlocks became sodden,
matted lumps, noxious smelling clods which clung to her scalp.� As Wayne also didn�t
let her use the toilet, Laisa was forced to go where she lay.� She defecated on the floor and forced her
urine through her clamped vagina lips.�
Soon the whole cellar became permeated with the vile bouquet.� Laisa absorbed it with every breath she took
and eventually she could not remember life without it.

After defecating on her, Wayne would remove
her gag and give her a glass of water and a piece of dry bread.� It was the only sustenance she received the
whole day.� As if even this was being
overly kind, after she had finished ravenously devouring the bread he quickly
tied her back to the wall and gave her the first of her daily beatings.� His implements would alter; sometimes the
whip, sometimes the paddle, sometimes a cane.�
It barely mattered to Laisa.� The
first blow across her backside was always the worst, bringing her skin back
alive and sending forth a bolt of pain that was as intense as the last one of
her previous beating.� Her screams echoed
around the cellar as she felt the now-familiar red mist engulf her eyes.� And it continued,
twenty or thirty more blows.� If Wayne was using the
cane he liked to send it travelling down the back of her cellulite-heavy thighs
until parallel red weals ran all the way down to her knees.� The whip was also used on her thighs but also
sent curling around her back, making the skin glow there as well.� The paddle, meanwhile, was used exclusively
on Laisa�s scarlet backside.� During the
beating the black feminist would scream, sob, curse and plead.� Wayne let her make as much noise as her agony demanded and took no heed
of it.� When the punishment finally
ended, he would gag her and go out to work.

Savage as the morning beatings were, they
were only a prelude to the evening sessions.�
After his dinner, Wayne tied Laisa face-up on the bench and again emptied his bladder and
bowls over her face.� Then his
imagination took over.� On her first full
day in captivity, the clamps were finally removed from her nipples.� She gasped with relief at the sudden slight
reprieve, although the throbbing was still intense and the once-firm buds
remained misshapen and blotched with red.�
Then Wayne produced two needles.� He
pushed them one by one into Laisa�s nipples, each millimetre of their
inexorable progress increasing her suffering by another notch.� Finally the needles had gone right through
and stuck out of the chocolate drops.� As
blood seeped down her breasts and she wept with pain, he produced two more
needles and bent over her vagina.� The
sharp metal rods were pushed through her vagina lips and clamped the slit
together.� Again Wayne guided them
slowly along their journey, apparently delicately though in truth to maximise
the pain.� Laisa screamed and threshed
her head back and forth, unable to cope with the sharp, incessant agony the
needles were bringing.� She thought she
had never felt pain like it before.�
Perhaps she had not � but then Wayne managed to
increase it.� He turned the black
feminist over on the bench, picked up his cane and set to work again.� Throughout the day Laisa had had to cope with
the severe throbbing from her backside.�
It had barely receded as hour followed interminable hour.� Now each crack of the willow made her body
burn with an ever-increasing fire.� Wayne struck
savagely and expertly, no thought of mercy in his mind.� Laisa�s cheeks had become a mottled morass of
bruises and weals.� Each time the cane
struck it landed across a dozen red lines, even landed exactly on the course of
an old blow.� Again the feminist�s thighs
were not spared.� Soon the dark brown
expanses of flab were covered almost as thickly with scarlet tramlines.� By the end of the session, Laisa was too
exhausted even to scream.� Each fresh
blow was only marked by a pitiful whimper; and between them she let out a low,
agonised keening noise.� Her eyes were
screwed shut, her mouth hung open to emit occasional dribbles of saliva.� Even the needles stuck into her were
eventually forgotten.� When Wayne finally
turned her back over, removed them and reattached the clamps to her bleeding
nipples and vagina lips, only another whimper greeted him.

The second and third nights, Wayne used the
paddle with equal ferocity.� By this time
Laisa�s backside had become a single great bruise.� The raised lines of the cane�s weals had been
lost in the discoloured mass.� It made no
difference to Wayne.� He stuck with the same
force as before and the slap of wood hitting flesh echoed endlessly around the
cellar.� Even lying on her back on the bench
had become an unendurable agony for Laisa.�
There was no word for the feeling evoked by the paddle each time it
landed.

On the second night, the beating was
preceded by Wayne lighting a candle and holding it over his captive.� He ran it across her shoulders, her breasts
and her ample stomach.� Everywhere it
travelled it dripped little globules of hot wax onto her flesh.� He paid especial attention to her vagina,
ringing the sensitive skin with lines of wax.�
Finally he brought the flame itself onto her wiry black pubic
hairs.� They sizzled, curled up and
vanished � while the wax continued to drip onto her mound.� Her groin was left sore, reddened and bald.� It was a painful and humiliating torture but
not excruciating.� Laisa even found herself willing for it to continue.� As long as it did, her beatings would be
deferred.� She continued to dimly hope
that Wayne would spare her � but of course that was in vain.

And he more than made up for the mildness
of the candle the next nigh.� Again Wayne removed the
nipple and vagina clamps.� This time he
replaced them with what felt like more clamps.�
However, they were electrodes attached to a generator he carried in and
plugged in.� Laisa watched in dazed
horror as he turned a dial on the generator.�
The next second a jolt of unimaginable force ripped through her.� It felt as if every part of her body had been
struck simultaneously.� Her whole body
convulsed, so powerfully that she almost broke through her bonds.� Consciousness slipped and slid around her
mind, only returning slowly and imperfectly.�
Even after she had recovered a little she continued quivering
uncontrollably.� Her feet kicked
helplessly together, her fingers flexed and a muscle in her cheek twitched
madly.� Wayne watched the
shaking, panting feminist with interest for a while.� Then he turned the dial once more.� Again she jerked violently, letting out an
oblivious �Nggg!�� Her head shot forward
and her sodden dreadlocks slapped across her face.� Wayne delicately peeled them off so he could see her wide, empty eyes and
her spasmodically twitching lips.

After each beating the ritual was always
the same.� Wayne would lift
her up � with some difficulty, for she was barely conscious by this stage � and
push her back to the wall bars.� Again he
would loop her leash over a higher bar and pull.� It may have been a ritual but Laisa could
never know for sure.� As she was lifted
coughing and kicking into the air, as the collar tightened around her throat,
the primal fear descended as thickly as ever.�
Each time she was convinced that this was the one, that her tormentor
would not let go and would turn into her murderer.� And her wide white eyes rolled panic-stricken
in her dark face and another stream of urine would seep through the tight
clamps on her vagina.

And now when Wayne did let go,
bringing her crashing back to the floor, the terror did not leave her.� Because she knew the ritual would be repeated
the next day, and the day after that, until the final time.� There was nothing she could do to stop
it.� The fear merged with her constant
pain, with the degradation she was plunged into.� More and more it was becoming the fact of who she was, pushing out her earlier identity.� Her previous existence as a
headstrong, militant feminist� that seemed like a dream now.� She was a creature to be tortured.� When Wayne chained her
back to the wall and left her in the cellar for another night,
that was the only reprieve she could comprehend.

Mel was still naked, still gagged, but
had been moved from the cellar.� Now she
was in Steve�s bedroom, tied face-down to his bed with her arms and legs wide
open.� Her broad backside was bright
scarlet.� Steve had continued her �re-education� once an hour for the past three evenings,
on the same lines as before.� Feminine
images brought pain; masculine ones or pictures of heterosexual sex spelled
reprieve.� It had not worked as he hoped,
however.� In the rare moments when he
removed the gag to allow her the minimum of food and water, she had cursed him
as fiercely as ever.� It was time for the
next stage.

Steve opened the bedroom door to let the
mistress in.� She was a skinny, rather
aged woman but she had dressed the part; black leather gloves, boots, corset, in fact black leather all over her body.� The whips she carried were also leather.� While she
hadn�t been cheap to hire, Steve had heard she would do what was asked
professionally and without hesitation.�
Nonetheless, she looked started when she first saw the obese feminist
bound to the bed.

�Are-� she
began but Steve put his finger to his lips and led her back out.

�Don�t speak, he ordered.� �Don�t break the mood.�

�OK.�
But are you sure about this?� the mistress whispered.� �It looks like she�s had enough already.�

�My wife likes it rough.�

�And she�s given her permission,
right?� There�s laws
about this.�

�Course she has.�

�All right.� I�ll trust you.� Well, I�ll trust your money.� OK, let�s do it.�

When they went back in, Steve motioned
for her to hold back.� He bent down by
Mel�s head.� �Mel,� he murmured.� �Look at me.��
She lifted her head and stared at him with bloodshot eyes.� Her rotund face was contorted by the gag and
by the pain constantly wracking her body.�
�And look over your shoulder,� Steve continued.� �At the woman waiting
there.� At the woman.�� Mel twisted her head round, not to obey Steve
but because she didn�t trust his words.� �She�s
going to hurt you, Mel,� Steve continued relentlessly.� �She�s going to hurt you because she wants
to.� She hates you, Mel.� You can�t trust your own kind.� There is no sisterhood, Mel.� You can�t trust women.�

He straightened up and indicated to the
mistress.� She snapped the whip between
her hands and raised her arm.� The
leather chord whistled through the air and curled viscously around Mel�s tender
buttocks.� The feminist instantly gave a
loud, muffled grunt and threw her head back, her face locked in a fearful
grimace.� Her midriff lifted up and
slammed back down onto the mattress, thrashing about as the pain coursed
through her.� The bed rattled with the
impact and the chords binding her to it bit deep into her wrists and
ankles.� The mistress waited till Mel had
subsided a little, then brought the whip across her
wobbling thighs.� As the feminist writhed
again in helpless agony, the mistress mouthed, �How many?� to Steve.� He held all twenty digits up.� The mistress looked dubious but then
shrugged.� And the whip was sent
whistling onto the broad expanses of Mel�s buttocks again.

After the twentieth blow had finally been
issued, as Mel lay weeping, twitching, writhing on the bed with a line of fresh
weals covering her backside and thighs, Steve held another sotto negotiation
with the mistress.� He untied his
prisoner from the bed, only to fasten her arms and legs tightly together and
pushed her face-down onto the floor.�
Then the mistress walked up and down her back.� She didn�t dig her spiked heels in � as Steve
had asked her to � but when she knelt down on Mel�s shoulders, pulled her head
back and spoke Steve�s words, she delivered them with real venom.� She called the feminist a bitch, a dyke, a
disgrace to her own kind.� She called her
a filthy ballbreaker who only lived like she did because she was too fat to
find a man, she called her a revolting animal all real
women were ashamed off.� The mistress
ignored the pleading look in Mel�s eyes, ignored the pitiful noises coming from
behind the gag.� Finally she squatted
over Mel, pulled her leather pants down and, Steve holding the feminist in
place, urinated on her.� Mel was able to
turn her head away but the golden liquid still splashed over her crew-cut head,
seeping between her stubbly hair and dribbling over
her cheeks.� The mistress had needed the
toilet anyway; the stream was a long one.

Mel lay sobbing
and coughing on the floor while Steve led the mistress out and paid her.� When he returned to the bedroom, he bent over
his captive and whispered in her ear, over and over,

�You can�t trust them, Mel.� You can�t trust them.�

The golden pendent gradually swung to a
halt.� Martin looked into Ariane�s
dilated pupils to satisfy himself, then commanded,

�Remove your clothes.�

Dream-like, the Iranian feminist stripped
off her blouse and skirt.� She alone was
held in fairly good conditions.� Of
course, she was locked in a small bedroom and bound and gagged for most of the
time.� However, Martin fed her well and
let her keep her clothes on when she wasn�t being punished.� But whenever he entered the room he
effectively removed her will.� The
pendant was forever swinging; and when it did, Ariane belonged to Martin.� It was becoming easier and easier.� The Iranian feminist was growing increasingly
receptive so that a few swings and a couple of words were all that were needed
now.� The most difficult part remained,
however.� How he could use this power to
control her when she was out of the pendant�s influence.

She stood naked before him, awaiting his
next instruction.� He savoured her slim,
dark body for a moment before asking, �Who am I?�

Ariane frowned.� �I� I don�t know.�

�Good.�
In a moment, someone else will come in.�
She�s a tall white woman, very plump, cropped hair, wearing dungarees-�

Her confusion grew for a second, then she brightened joyfully.� �Mel��

�That�s right.� Mel.�
You�ll do exactly what she says.�

Martin let the room.� He returned a second later carrying a
cane.� As soon as she saw him, Ariane�s
face blossomed rapturously and she rushed towards him.� �Mel, where have you-�

�Stop,� Martin rapped out.� �Shut up.�
Lie face down on the bed.� Don�t
move from there.�

Confused but still excited, Ariane did as
instructed.� Her backside and thighs,
right down to her knees, were a criss-crossed mass of weals.� �Mel, what�s wrong?� I�m so glad to see you, darling.� I- aargh!�

The cane had come down savagely across
her injured backside.� Ariane leapt
half-way up, but after a gesture from Steve fell whimpering back down onto the
mattress.� �Christ, what are you doing?�
she cried.� �Mel, what�s � nyaargh!�� A horizontal stroke had landed across her
left buttock.� The Iranian feminist
writhed in agony on the bed, punching the pillow helplessly.� With tears beginning to run down her cheeks,
she twisted her head round to stare at Steve.�
�Please, Mel!� Why are you doing
this?�

�I can�t help it.� He told me to.�� Martin leant over and gave her right buttock
the same treatment.� Ariane�s
whole body convulsed in pain.

�Christ, no, Mel!� Please don�t!� Who?�
Who told you to?�

�That man.� Martin.� I�ve got no choice.� I belong to him now.�

�What do you � aaaargh!�� A particularly brutal stroke landed on the
join between her buttocks and thighs.� She
screamed, wept, thrashed wildly around the mattress.� As soon as she had calmed down just a little,
a fresh crack announced another blow falling squarely across both cheeks.

�I belong to him,� Martin repeated to the
sobbing feminist.� �We all do now.� Don�t you see?� The movement�s over.� We�ve lost.�

�What are � yaaargh!�� The cane had bit into Ariane�s backside one
more time.� A fresh cluster of red weals
were already forming on her delicate skin.�
�Please, Mel, for God�s sake!� she screamed.� �How can you do this to me?� I love you.�

�I�m sorry.� I really am.�
But I�ve got to do whatever he says.�
I belong to him.� And he wants me
to make you realise that.�� This time the
willow landed across the slender, writhing thighs.�

�See what?� Ariane moaned piteously.� �Oh God, see what?� What�s he done to you?�

�He conquered me.� They�ve conquered us all.� Parveena and Laisa too.� The movement�s over.� And you have to give in to him.� I�ve accepted him as my master.� You�ve got to do the same.�

�You�ve gone fucking mad.� I�ll � aaaagh!�� Her body kicked up and down as the pain from
the fresh stroke coursed through it.�
Then she screamed again; a vicious diagonal blow across her buttocks.� And again; one more scarlet line to decorate
her thighs.

�It�s the only way to stop him,� Martin
told her flatly.� �Believe me, I tried to
resist.� But it�s the only way to stop
the pain.�

So it continued; the brutal caning which
Ariane thought was being delivered by the woman she loved most in all the world.� And
with each fresh burst of agony, a little more of her conviction crumbled away.

By this time, Parveena was having
difficulty even remembering who she was.

She spent day and night chained to the
wall, totally encased in her rubber suit.�
She could not move, could not see, could not speak, could not hear, could not touch.� Once
a day a tiny hole was unzipped in front of her mouth and her gag removed.� A tube was pressed between her lips and a
thick liquid was poured down it.� She
swallowed the liquid because there was no alternative.� Afterwards, the gag was put back again, that
zip was closed, another by her groin was opened and a tube was inserted a
little way into her vagina.� She urinated down it; not very much because her sustenance was so
slight.� With one notable exception,
these were her only connections with the outside world.� With any world, for that
matter.� She was trapped in a void
with nothing to keep hold of.� Soon even
the simplest of actions, the tiniest movement, the glimpse of sight, became
distant and fantastic memories.� And then
her very thoughts began flowing away from her.�
She tried constantly reminding herself of the basic things; her name,
who she was before the imprisonment began.�
Gradually, though, they became mere labels and she forgot what they
meant.� She may have slept or not.� The distinction between waking and sleeping
had grown so blurred that it was hard to tell.�
For Parveena there was only one thing left in the world, one force which
lit up the blank void.

Once a day Neil
unzipped the panel of the suit which covered her buttocks.� He then gave her at least
thirty blows to her cheeks.� Sometimes he
used a paddle, sometimes a cane.� Each
was delivered with all his strength, making no allowances for the mass of red
blotches already disfiguring the feminist�s skin.� Parveena screamed deep in her throat � but of
course, nobody heard her.� The strokes
were regular, patient, well-measured.�
Neil had all the time he wanted and he knew his victim could do nothing
to resist.� And after the final blow had
been delivered, he immediately fastened the panel back again.� The thick leather trapped the heat of the
beating in and Parveena�s sole contact with the outside world was lost.

That was all she knew now.� It was increasingly all she could remember.� Pain.� It was the sole component of her life.� And this strange rubber mannequin, once a
lively, independent feminist, gradually began to internalise the role forced
upon her.� During the hours and days she
hung motionless, knowing nothing beyond the intense throb of her buttocks, she
started to accept it.� Not because she
wanted to.� Simply
because thee was no other choice.�
She also knew there was one final part to her submission.� She hadn�t been given the choice yet.� There was no time between the gag and the
tube.� When the moment came, though, she
was sure she would take it.� In the tiny
part of her mind still capable of rational thought she reasoned: it might bring
release.

Day after day Wayne�s torture of
Laisa increased.� After the black
feminist had been imprisoned in his cellar for three weeks, the evening
sessions were lasting well over an hour in their entirety.� He still defecated and urinated on her as a
prelude.� Straight afterwards, though, he
now dragged her over to a large bucket.�
It was slopping full of what could only be labelled waste.� A Vile mixture of urine and
watery faeces, possibly not all human in origin.� Wayne pulled Laisa�s head up by her dreadlocks and plunged it into the
bucket.� He applied the same method as
the daily hangings.� Laisa was held under
for over a minute until she was close to passing out.� The liquid seeped into her nose, her ears, all her pores.�
Sometimes she accidentally swallowed a mouthful and once it got into her
eyes.� She would struggle instinctively a
little but she had no strength left.� Her
thrashings grew increasingly feeble as time wore on and her air
disappeared.� Finally, as she was growing
feeble, her head was abruptly dragged out again.� She would be thrown to the floor and lie
coughing desperately.� Some of the caked
faeces on her face was at least being washed away by
the immersions, but her ebony skin was being stained a dull, inhuman
colour.� Her dreads were now just a
single sodden lump and she smelt truly appalling.

Then she was dragged to the bench.� Mostly she would not resist or even protest
but let Wayne take her from punishment to punishment with blank resignation.� Her face was permanently etched into lines of
misery and her eyes were dull and vacant.�
She waited as Wayne re-attached the electrodes to her nipples and genitals.� Several times a night her body convulsed as
the electric charge coursed through it.�
There was no way to prepare for them, no way to accustom herself to them.�
Indeed, each one seemed to be worst than the last.� Every time the current seemed to strike every
part of her body simultaneously, knocking her mind into numbness.� Her head tossed wildly, slapping the drenched
dreadlocks across her face; her fat breasts and thighs wobbled for minutes
afterwards.

One day Wayne attached
those breasts with a series of long, thin needles.� He removed the various clamps from her
nipples and slid one shaft into the disfigured bud on her right breast.� Its journey did not stop until the point was
protruding from the far aside.� The left
nipple was punctured in the same way.�
His movements were terribly slow and methodical.� He slid the metal in and guided it with
apparent care.� His only concern, though,
was to extract the maximum amount of pain.�
He wanted her to feel every centimetre of the voyage.� No sooner were Laisa�s buds skewered, he took
two more needles and slid them into her breasts just beneath the tip.� And then two more a little
further down.� Soon she had a line
running half-way down each of her large breasts, two rows of metal heads
delving in one side and sticky, sharp tips peeking out of the other.� It was excruciating, of course.� Blood was dribbling down her body and she was
whimpering pitifully from an agony which seemed to grow with every second.� Alongside the pain was fear.� She was terrified that Wayne wouldn�t
remove the metal from her body before giving her the next electric charge.� Because she was still convinced he meant to
kill her eventually.

Naturally, the beatings still came each
evening.� It was almost a relief to Laisa
when she was turned over and they began.�
At least they were uncomplicated and predictable.� And by now her backside and thighs ached so
incessantly that when the whip rained down on them again,
the agony only increased a little.� She
could still dimly remember what it had been like to feel the bite for the first
time.� But she couldn�t recall a life
without the throbbing from her cheeks.�
That was too distant.

On the twenty first day of her
imprisonment there was a change in the routine.�
After beating Laisa especially heavily, he left her tied face-down on
the bench and left the cellar.� He
returned a few minutes later.� On his
command, she looked up dully and saw he was leading a large Irish
wolfhound.� She didn�t comprehend its meaning
at first.� Then, however, he spoke an
order to it.� With his help, the dog
climbed onto the bench in between her outstretched legs.� She felt a wet nose snuffling her
vagina.� A rough tongue licked her
lips.� Wayne walked
further along the bench, pulling the dog with him.� Laisa felt the fur of its belly tickling her
sore back as it crouched on top of her.�
A sudden bark in her ear made her flinch.� The dog was straddling over her.� She could hear its rapid pants, smell the
rankness of its breath, feel a little globule of its
saliva drip onto her shoulder.� She
understood now but refused to accept the truth.�
Even though all signs were pointing to it � that couldn�t be right, could
it?� Surely even Wayne, utterly
depraved though he was, had his limits? �He wasn�t about to-

Then a thick, hard pens
began to enter her vagina.� She sensed Wayne�s hands reach
down and help guide the rod inside her.�
The dog gave another harsh bark of excitement.� And Laisa came alive.� She had lain passively through all her torments
of the past few days but she was suddenly energised again.� Her eyes shot wide open, her torso buckled
wildly, her limbs strained at her bonds and she began screaming into her gag.� Yet it was for nothing.� Her struggles were in vain and they were not
heeded.� Wayne finished
helping the wolfhound�s dick into her body.�
The knot thickened deep inside her.�
He held his dog steady as it began to fuck her.� Its strokes were hasty, clumsy, without any
subtlety at all; but it knew what to do.�
Its hind quarters rapidly pumped up and down as its cock slid
incessantly through the tight channel.�
Laisa wasn�t the first woman it had fucked.� Wayne had trained it on a series of very well paid prostitutes.� Perhaps the dog got genuine pleasure from the
act � who knew.� Wayne only cared
about the satisfaction he got from watching it.�
The hairy body pumping into the smooth one; the exquisite look of
disgust on the face of the women as they thought what was happening to her.� And seeing this feminist dyke get a real dick
was best of all.

Laisa had to endure it.� There was no other choice.� She had to lie there as the canine rod
plunged in and out of her�
The smell and touch of the beast were constant reminders of what
was inside her.� Her virginity had
technically gone a long time ago; a series of candles, dildos and fingers had
seen to that.� She had never let a man
touch her, though.� She had never had a
live penis inside her.� And now� She felt physically sick but there was something
beneath her nausea.� A
deep, empty pit.� Everything she
was proud of was destroyed.� Everything
she had fought for was lost.� She had
nothing left.� This was the end result of
her struggle; bound to a table while a dog raped her.� Laisa even forgot that she had been drugged
and brought to the cellar against her will.�
Her degradation was so complete that she started believing she was
complicit in it.� The wolfhound began to
make a curious low growling sound as it reached its climax.� Its thrusts became even more frantic.� The pain which its bulbous penis generated
became more intense.� The dog continued
to jerk for a few seconds more.� Finally
it emitted a burst of cum into Laisa�s pussy.

And something snapped inside her.� as she felt the
warm, sticky substance seep into her, her mind began to crumble.� She thought about her current humiliation,
about the last weeks of torture and the future stretching out in front of
her.� Only one thing was certain now.� There was no way out.� She had lost.�
Her only hope was to admit that realisation in the hope that he would
make it� better.� She no longer prayed
for her release.� What would she be
released into now?� But could she get a little
mercy.

Wayne seemed to sense the change which had come over her.� After pulling his sated dog off the black feminist,
noting with glee the glistening traces of cum clinging to her dark lips, he
removed her gag.� Sure enough, the first
words she spoke were the ones he had been striving so hard for�

Later she spoke them again over the
phone.� Steve, Neil and Martin still came
round the next evening to hear them in person.�
Anyway, there were further checks they wanted to do.

Laisa was carefully prepared for the
interview.� Her dreadlocks were shaved
off, right down to the scalp.� A long
blond wig was fitted in their place.� A
tight leather corset, buttoned at the sides, harshly trimmed back her extensive
belly.� Her large breasts hung over the
top of it.� They were ringed at the base
by leather bands fastened to rings on the corset.� A pair of nipple clamps hung from the other
end of her breasts, these with little tassels attached.� More leather covered her thick legs, this
time in the form of binding fishnet tights also fastened to the corset.� The feminist awkwardly balanced her bulk on
high-heeled shoes.� Cuffs tied her ankles
and wrists close together and she wore a dog collar, the leash firmly in Wayne�s grasp.

The last three details were just further
ways of confirming her humiliation rather than precautions.� Wayne knew she would not try to escape.�
He knew it so surely that he brought her out of the cellar into the
sitting room.� And when his friends
arrived he even took her with him to answer the door, giving her her first
taste of fresh air for nearly a month.�
She did not respond to it, however.�
Nor did she react as Wayne fitted her uniform in place.�
She had become an automaton.� She
only did anything when she was instructed to.�
At all other times she just stared dully into space, her eyes glazed and
mouth slightly ajar.� And when the other
three men entered and lounged on the sofa, she stood in front of them for
inspection.

�Shit, Wayne,� Martin
laughed.� �This can�t be the same stroppy
nigger, can it?�

�Course.� Tell them who I am, nigger.�

In a dead voice, Laisa said, �You�re my
Master.�

�And who are you?�

�I�m your slave, Master.�

�You�re my fat nigger monkey slave.�

�I�m your fat nigger monkey slave, Master.�

The other three were already unzipping
their trousers.� �Guess you win, Wayne,� Steve
said.� �That�s a pound we all owe
you.� In the meantime� we�ve got some
bananas for the monkey.�

Laisa was made to crouch down in front of
them.� Martin thrust his cock in her
mouth and ordered her to suck.� While she
obeyed, Wayne bent over her and took her crudely from behind.� He had never wanted her before.� She revolted him too much.� In the context, though, seeing how it would
further her humiliation, it suddenly became exciting.� Martin tugged hard on her leash,
Wayne�s thrusts were as harsh as his strokes when he beat her.� After they had finished, she had to swallow
Steve�s cum while Neil roughly sodomised her.�
For an encore, they all watched as Wayne�s wolfhound
fucked her again.� Finally she lay still
on the carpet, five sets of semen inside her.�
The men formed a circle and urinated on her.� Any hope of mercy was comprehensively
dashed.� Laisa was their plaything now
and they would do whatever their perverse imagination suggested.

She was given a reprieve, however.� Wayne may have won the bet but that was never really the purpose of the
exercise.� All four feminists had to be
broken utterly and brought to the same subjugation as Laisa.� The other men returned to their homes, their
tasks and their captives.

Parveena crumbled the next day.� Neil�s thoroughness probably cost him the
bet.� She may have surrendered earlier
but he wanted to keep her locked away to make sure.� Days and nights locked in sensory
deprivation, knowing nothing but pain, had all but destroyed her mind.� Virtually everything had flowed away from
her.� When Neil finally removed her mask
and spoke the instructions in her ear, she agreed because she could manage
nothing else.� Independent thought was
lost to her.� The orders about how she
would live her life in the future, the service she would show him, the correct
positions for men and women� the Indonesian girl accepted them all.� She had become a blank page for him to write
on.� And if she paused when he unstrapped
her gag, that was simply because she was trying to
remember the basic mechanics of speech.�
Finally, though, she managed to gasp out the words he was waiting for.

Ariane didn�t last much longer.� Martin�s unrelenting hypnosis had undermined
her whole world.� She truly believed that
every night one of her friends, even her lover, was coming into her room and
beating her.� Try as she did to fight it,
that was what her senses, sight, hearing and � especially � touch was telling
her.� She couldn�t understand why, or
what had happened.� But faced with the
overlapping waves of pain, with her former �sisters� telling her that the only
way to escape it was to surrender, that was all she could do in the end.

And that only left Mel.� Steve�s methods had not proved as effective
as the others.� Having not been as clever
as Martin, thorough as Neil or barbarically cruel as Wayne, he was
having trouble breaking the white feminist.�
He beat her until her skin was bleeding and she was screaming into her
gag.� He showed her endless films and
slides, brought prostitutes into her room, tried
everything in his clumsy brainwashing repertoire.� It was no good.� Mel sometimes begged him for mercy and
sometimes she seemed close to the edge.�
She refused to say the one word he needed, however.

Finally he had to ask his friends for
help.� They happily agreed; they had
never really been competing against one another.� Besides, time was passing.� Therefore, over a month after the feminists
were first abducted, a small party gathered at Steve�s house.� The host brought the guests into the hall and
looked with approval at what they had brought.

Each man led his slave by a little chain
fastened to her dog collar.� The three
former feminists were otherwise unbound although their outfits incorporated a
large amount of leather and chains, strapped around their arms and legs, circling
their breasts, hanging from their genitals.�
Parveena wore a tight leather hood with a small hole cut in it for her
face.� Laisa�s ample belly was fastened
back by a very tight corset.� All also
wore fishnet tights, high heels and ample makeup.� They looked like whores at a particularly seedy
brothel.� Each woman walked behind her
master mutely and obediently, stopping when he did and obeying every
instruction.� Their eyes were blank,
their faces vacant.

The group followed Steve into the
bedroom.� Mel�s obese frame was still
tied face-down to the bed.� She was
gagged and naked.� Her eyes were closed
and Steve had to slap her face several times before she opened them.� When she did she gave him a drugged, tearful
glare of pure malice.

�Wake up, Mel,� Steve murmured in her
ear.� �There�s
some friends of yours to see you.�
Remember them?�

Mel craned a look over her shoulder.� For a moment she stared in
incomprehension.� Then her eyes widened
in horror as she recognised the three demeaned figures by the
beg.� Muffled cries came from
behind her gag.

�Tell them who you are, whores,� Steve
instructed.

Parveena said, �I am Neil�s slave.� He is my Master.�

Ariane said, �I am Martin�s slave.� He is my Master.�

And Laisa said, �I am Wayne�s slave.� He is my Master.�

All three spoke in the same lifeless, automatic
monotones.� Steve smiled and indicated to
Ariane.� On a command from Martin, the
Iranian girl kneeled down in front of him while he unzipped his trousers.� Mel continued to watch with wide eyes.� She seemed transfixed by the scene,
mesmerised as Ariane took Steve�s dick in her mouth and began to suck.� And eventually Mel had to watch Steve�s
buttocks jerk a little; and she had to hear the horrible sucking as Ariane
gobbled down his cum.� When the Iranian
girl was eventually pulled away, her lips were still smeared with a bright
sticky substance.� Mel continued staring
at the spectacle.� She pictured what her
girlfriend had been; feisty, independent, commanded by nobody.� She contrasted that image with the
subjugated, humiliated creature before her. �And she looked at her two other housemates,
two more vacant sexual objects.� What had
happened to them?� Whatever it was, it
had destroyed them.� And Mel felt the
memories of her own ordeal overwhelming her and her last resistance ebbing
away.

It was gone by the end of the night.� Perhaps it went the moment Steve hauled
Ariane back to her feet and put a cane in her hand.� Or when Martin pushed her towards Mel and
issued the command.� Or
when Ariane obeyed instantly.� Or
the first time the willow bit into Mel�s tender cheeks, driven down mercilessly
by her girlfriend.� Or the second time
the cane landed.� Or the fifth, the
tenth, the twentieth.

�This is the place, right?�
The place I�ve heard about��

�That�s right.� Come in.��
Neil stepped back to admit the five slightly drunken young men.� As soon as they were inside the living room,
they could see it was the right place.

It had once been a squat which housed
five militant feminists and their radical society.� Now it had been taken over, cleaned up and
transformed.� There was dim lighting,
soft furnishings, incense burning and soul music playing.� One man, Steve, leant casually against a wall
to keep an eye on proceedings.� Another,
Martin, stood behind the three exhibits lined up on the sofa.

�Take a good look, boys,� Neil
invited.� One of the women was white, one
Indonesian and the third Iranian.� All
wore skimpy tops, very short skirts, fishnet tights and high heels.� Their faces were caked with thick makeup and
their hair was long; a silver wig in the case of the white woman.� They sat passively as the men leered at them
and made suggestive comments.� They
seemed incapable of showing any emotion or intelligence.

�How much?� one boy asked.

�Twenty quid for a blow job, fifty for
the full works, seventy five for a threesome.�
That�s for Slinty and Paki,� he added, poking Parveena and Ariane.� �For Lard-arse,� he indicated Mel, �Thirty
for a screw, blow job a tenner.�

�Fat fuck, isn�t she?� the boy sniggered

�Hence the name.� And the
discount.�

�Do they talk?� another man asked.

�No.�

�Heard you had another.� A black
piece.�

Neil nodded.� �This way,� he said, leading the boys
out.� �The Chimp.� Special rates for her.� A hundred quid minimum.� And you�ll need to say up front what you�re
gonna do to her and we might need to negotiate.�

He took his clients into a bedroom.� An obese black woman, her head shaven
completely bald, was spread-eagled face down on a double bed.� Leather cords bound her wrists and ankles to
the frame.� She was naked save for a
blindfold and a ball gag.� Her backside
was flushed deep scarlet and covered with weals.� More red lines ran down the back of her
thighs right down to her calves.

�Jesus!� one man exclaimed.� �She�s even fatter than the one outside.� A hundred quid?�

�Ah, but that�ll buy you a lot,� Neil
smiled.� �You can do what you want with
The Chimp.� Live out your darkest
fantasies, lads.� Anything you�ve ever
dreamed of.� I mean anything.�

�Doesn�t she mind?�

�She doesn�t complain.�

One man lurched around the bed, bent down
and stared into Laisa�s dead eyes.� �Hello,�
he leered, snapping his fingers in front of them.� �Anyone in there?�

�No-one much,� Neil said.� Laisa made no response whatsoever.� �Don�t play with her if you�re not buying.�

�Oh, we�re buying,� he was promised.� The group returned to the living room to make
the arrangements.� One man, harder up
than the rest, could only afford Mel.�
One took Ariane while another two decided to double up on Parveena.� All three ordered �the full works.�� The slaves nodded dumbly when informed of
their duties.� They rose and silently led
their clients upstairs into bedrooms tackily refurbished with soft drapes and
dim lights.� Ariane lay on the bed,
undressed, spread her legs and let the drunk young man
roughly enter her.� Her expression did
not alter throughout.� Mel was turned on
her front and taken doggy-style, an act which lasted a surprisingly long
time.� Parveena was forced to suck one
man�s penis while the other was plunged in and out of her vagina.� The two spurts of semen entered her body
simultaneously.� Meanwhile, the final
punter paid �100 for the use of Laisa.�
Giving full reign to his fantasies, he caned her mutilated buttocks for
some time, dripped hot wax on her back and urinated over her smooth scalp.� He paid Neil an extra �50 to watch a
wolfhound climb on top of her and vigorously screw her.� Finally, unable to hold back any longer, he
masturbated until semen splattered over her face.

Neil was right; Laisa didn�t
complain.� Even without the precautionary
gag she probably wouldn�t have made a noise.�
None of the quartet did.� They did
what they were told.� And what they were
told to do was prostitute themselves for the financial benefit of the men who
had conquered them.� Almost every night
there were fresh punters.� Almost every
night the women opened their legs or, in Laisa�s case, submitted to intense
torture.� They had no life outside the
house and were rarely allowed to leave it.�
Laisa almost never left her room.�
Her mind had been destroyed.� She
could not speak, could not dress herself, could barely
remember how to walk.� She recognised
only the simplest instructions � �turn over,� �lie still� and only responded to
�Chimp� or �nigger.�� And though the
others still just about remembered their own names, they could barely recall
their earlier lives.� Ariane and Mel were
not lovers, neither were Parveena and Mel.�
They were not activists and were not women with any identities.� They were prostitutes and they were
slaves.� That was what became of the
radical feminist group FACE.
