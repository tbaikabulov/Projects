Synopsis: socialite Rebekah Stephens finds what rock bottom really feels like when she betrays The Company's trust.






Desert Fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Norm deals with an associates wife's indiscretions firmly but gently.

She swept into the Casino like an old time film star, a vision in white and cream, immaculate grooming her blond hair cascading over her shoulders. Conversation diminished as men turned to stare and women scowl with jealousy. I stood and she changed direction to glide towards me, "Mr McGuire" I kissed her gloved hand.

"Ah Mrs Stephens, you came".
 
"Was it not, as they say, an offer I could not refuse." 

"Perhaps."�I replied.

"So why the opposition's establishment." 

"Neutral territory, but first let us eat, drink and then business." 

A waiter came, we ordered, we ate and drank, I drank a cola and she mineral water, although most people paid less for champagne than I paid for her "spring" water.

The food was rubbish, beautifully presented tiny portions which tasted like cardboard.&nbsp; In the shadows&nbsp; the management team was growing, word getting round, they congregated behind the bar watching us.
Rebekah Stephens had, you see, been a naughty girl; we in the Company prized loyalty above all, most employees knew the value of loyalty, most had skeletons in cupboards well known to other employees, as in we all hang together or we all hang separately, but Rebekah, she was different, rich her family had money, her, first Husband was rich, her divorce settlement generous, a whirlwind romance and instant Las Vegas marriage to Andy Stephens followed and now she was a real problem, too much money, too much time away from Andy, not part of the Company social scene she was mixing with the competition and was number one suspect for a leak of sensitive information. 
"So Mrs Stephens, a little bird tells me that you have been seeing Mr Jarvis from the management team of this very restaurant, in fact the gentleman in the blue and white shirt behind the centre pillar of the Bar, behind me."
She showed no emotion, "So." 
"They compete with us in this market segment." 
"And", she remained cool.�
"Company rules state that the husband takes full responsibility for any breaches of confidentiality."�
"What breaches." 
"Figures." 
"What do you mean figures," she was intrigued." 
"The ones Andy brought home and Mr Jarvis acquired." 
"That is preposterous, Mr McGuire, many people have access to Company figures." 
"Ah but not those figures, the file name, there was only ever one copy of that file, Andrew came to me, you see, and, I am afraid, we set you up." 
The colour drained slowly from her face, "I categorically deny any wrongdoing" she said but the waver in her voice betrayed her. 
"In that case I have a letter here for Andrew, only he or you could have passed on the figures."�
I handed it to her,�"Read it" It was a notice of dismissal "He will easily find a new job, in a Burger joint."�
The Company was well known for the dismissal Policy with instant return of Company property and loss of pension rights, and with ninety per cent of�all company employees in company accommodation, this was, and was intended, to be traumatic.
She looked perplexed, I signalled the waiter signed for the meal. "Thank you for a wonderful evening, have a drink and I will send Andrew to collect you," I left.
I guessed she did not know Norm and Jeanie from accounts dressed in hired tux and an elegant black gown borrowed from the company designer label shop, sitting at a table by the bar and dragging the meal out as long as possible, a rare treat, but they saw her approach and speak to the guy in the striped shirt.
The management had disappeared when I returned with Andrew twenty minutes later, we joined Rebekah at the bar, just in time as she had clearly been drinking heavily since I left.�
Norm and Jeanie were having a final drink, cola for Norm something in a long glass for Jeanie as we left and our Limo smoothly glided to the door, Rebekah climbed aboard,�Norm walked past on his way to the parking lot. 
"Say Norm, can I get a ride" I asked.
"Sure its down here," and I wished Andrew good night and followed Norm to his ageing Ford.�He confirmed Rebekah had spoken animatedly to the people behind the bar. 
The SUV was waiting at Norms for me, "Was the Dress Ok," 
"Yes great, I wish it did not have to go back." she sighed, she looked at least a few&nbsp; hundred thousand dollars if not a million.
"I'm glad, keep it, here is the receipt for it." 
I handed her the piece of paper, "you did a good job, thanks"
A lonely night in my room at HQ followed, then the early morning conference, sealed bids for the vacant former restaurant Bastille due in at 10 a.m. and the competition completely thrown by the revelation that we had fed them bogus figures. 
We Couriered our bid over at 9. 55, and at eleven we found we owned a new restaurant, for exactly the figure Rebekah had given them, and immediately the management team was assembled, Andrew took the chair, I handed round some preliminary notes.
"May I see you, Sir" said Andrew?" 
"Sure"&nbsp; I said, ushering him to my room, well room, it was like the captains sea cabin on a ship, (double) bed, desk, chair, TV but there was an en suite shower and WC, and space for a few suits, sort of a bachelor pad. 
"She won't admit it, so I will divorce her but hell, I love her, can't you do something for me, put her on a program." 
I thought, "Look everyone in town knows her so everyone will know if we put her through a program here,&nbsp;&nbsp; but if it's about getting her to sign I think I know the answer," 
My mind was racing, "I'll book her in Pine Lake for Saturday and you should have a more amenable wife within a fortnight or at worst three weeks." 
I made arrangements, even Rebekah agreed when Nikki our receptionist phoned her, suggesting a fortnight's rest cure, I figured I deserved a rest and I would oversee this one personally, leaving instructions as to where I could be contacted.
I thought about Nikki, she was about twenty two, brunet sweet girl, no harm in her, too kind perhaps but pleasantly curvy and a kind face, had twice been found with a man in her flat contrary to Company policy&nbsp; and I was waiting suitable way for her to atone for her misdemeanour's, nothing wrong with her having a man but security check before he stayed overnight in a company flat was required.�
She worked 9 till 5 but had come in early, and stayed late, she wore a smart blue skirt and jacket white blouse as usual, Lunchtime came and I ate in our HQ cafe�and then activity dwindled, Nikki started playing a computer game as phone calls diminished, "Nikki," I asked " I wonder if you could do some extra work, to redeem your record."
"When" she asked nervously. 
"Tonight." 
"Where." 
"Here, not a club, with me." 
"oh, I don't know".�
Knock backs are always disappointing. "Can you move in with Andrew while his wife is away then, keep him out of temptation, that sort of thing. 
"Oh yes sir certainly, sir" it gets worse, she obviously fancies Andrew and not me.
Time passed, the workers went home, the overnight team came in to oversee the security business, I wandered around but everything was working smoothly, I debated going out but no it would be the Captains cabin once again. I checked a few figures on the computer, had some steak salad and fries sent down, checked where our planes were against where they should be, and soon it was ten o'clock.
I showered put on pyjamas and Bathrobe and became aware that someone was in the outer office, Nikki was sitting at her desk, "Hi still here" I enquired."�
"I came back just now" she replied "I thought you might need company."�
"Have you eaten." I asked.
"Yes thank you" she said, "Mr McGuire, what exactly do you expect me to do," 
"Would you like a diagram" 
She laughed "My reputation has preceded me I am afraid." 
I did not quite know what to say "but earlier on I saw a nicely curved sexy little body and a pretty face and wanted what I saw, I don't often get rejected, it was a bit humbling."
"Will it go against me if I don't stay with you." 
"No run along." I said wishing she would stay.
"Don't you want me." 
"Yes I want you." 
"Do you want me to do a strip tease?" 
"Actually there are some night things in the cupboard marked 2D so if you would care to choose something, take a shower if you want, and I will finish up here". 
I shut down the computer and heard the shower. I slid into bed; she appeared in a white negligee carrying her suit, I got her a coat hanger and found a hook for her then we climbed into bed.�
"I was expecting to be ravished." she said sadly.
"No loved and cherished" I explored her body, she was lovely and warm and wet where it mattered so a brief interlude of applying a condom we enjoyed some warm gentle love making, then we washed up and straightened the covers. 
"You are a strange man Mr McGuire I expected to be tied up, whipped and ravished and yet this," she paused searching for the words, "we were like an old married couple." 
"Go to sleep dear" I said.
Next morning she woke me by kissing my chest. I had an erection on to which she slid a condom then she sat down on it and leaped up and down, it was all a bit amateurish and I grabbed her round the waist and sat her on the edge of the bed to get maximum penetration, "Oh God, Oh my god" she squealed as she pulled the negligee over her head and thrust a nipple into my face which I dutifully sucked, and�we came if not together then pretty close, "Good morning dear" I said�.
"Was that all right sir." 
"Lovely, more than all right ." 
"You did not do anything kinky." 
"What did you expect?" I asked
"In the shower or with a whip or up my bum or come over my tits and face and hair",
"That last sounds nice, will you hold your breasts to form a�cunt and," 
That's when you found the bed was too short,"�she slid down hanging her legs over the end of the bed.
 "Now try" The feel of skin on skin was intoxicating and soon her face was spattered with my come.
"Better as a fantasy than reality " I queried..
"No it was nice, your cum tastes salty," she said licking some off her fingers and extending her tongue in search of more "I don't know when I last did that." 
I said "I don't think we got any in your here" as I stroked her hair " but look its work time, we had better get ready" We showered together and by 9 were back at work.

Rebekah Stephens was a rather more difficult proposition; She arrived at the Pine Lake facility in full film star mode sunglasses, black dress masses of black chiffon over sort of Hot Pants as they used to call them and with a bare midriff, her skin bare yet protected, matching accessories all the trappings of wealth.
She spotted me in the check in area and we spoke briefly, "A rest cure, really Mr McGuire, what a waste of time," she chided me "I am sure Andrew will move a slut in to fuck so you will have to allow me the same latitude with any fit men I encounter" she spoke down to me confident she had out witted me over the disclosure of Company figures.
I checked her program, Injections, blood tests, etc, Saturday and Sunday and then as required Monday. I had booked the Company Bentley Convertible and enjoyed a drive into the Mountains, I topped up the gas, at nine miles per gallon it soon ran short compared to the other cars I drove.�Rebekah watched me working, "that is a Chauffeurs job Mr McGuire", 
"Best job there is, driving posh cars all day." I really meant it, "Want a ride?" 
"What, it's almost dark." she observed.
"See the lights from the mountain" I suggested.
" Alone with you again, I think not" She went inside.
She had a manicure and pedicure from a couple of girls from a club masquerading as beauty therapists and they seemed to do a good job then she swam and did the exercise bike and had more injections, the Companies special anti infection drug against HIV Aids and other common sexually transmitted diseases.
By Monday the tests showed antibodies were indeed at acceptable levels and the next injection, allegedly a Vitamin put her to sleep,.
Andrew supervised the packing of her cases and her and their transfer to Company Field where we strapped her into a reclining seat /bed in the seating in the hump behind the pilot on our 747 freighter, he wished me well and climbed down to the apron and watched as we flew off, with a cargo of mixed high value freight for Africa.�
Rebekah woke en route, I released her belt and assisted her to sit up, 
"What is going on? she asked.
"Ah a little side trip I wish to discuss further the matter of the company information disclosure, Andrew does not wish to divorce you, despite your screwing anything in pants," 
"Except you" she pointed out.
"Except me thus far, yes but let me show you how the other half live first, then I shall ask you to confess"
"And Andrew, I expect he is screwing every diseased slut in the company". 
"Oh no, I found him a lovely girl, twenty something, I tested her the other night she was lovely, curvy and she works for us, she is perfect."�She looked surprised, the journey passed, she chatted to every man on the plane avoiding me. 
We landed at LG3 our former military airbase in Saharan North Africa, usual question, "Are we refuelling"? 
"No we have arrived. "
Men began to unload the cargo hold of the 747 including a replacement four seat helicopter. Mr Umzambuki strip manager arrived and welcomed us, "Mr McGuire, an Honour indeed." he meant it, the guy was sincere not like the ass lickers&nbsp; back home, and I liked the guy and I was pleased to see him too.
" Mr Umzambuki, I am very pleased to be here again, do you have rooms for Mrs Stephens and I?" 
"Oh yes come,"
"And a servant for Mrs Stephens," 
"Yes sir" He led us tot he main block where the visitor suites had been configured for us instead of being used for spare parts their usual role. 
"Excellent, and Dinner", I asked.
 "Yes sir at eight our time", 
"Thank you"�We ate in the Mess Hall, Rebekah pilots and management at our top table lower ranks and women further down, she ignored me.
Stanley Neil had flown out with us, dressed as a mechanic, Rebekah barely noticed him, but he was an expert Helicopter Pilot as was Bill Haydock due in next day.
We went to our own beds but I suspect this was because I told them Rebekah was mine.
Next day Stanley and Bill joined Rebekah and me, "This is the trip I promised you," I told her.
Rebekah and I took the rear seats in the Bell, and with Stanley at the controls we flew south following the road then veered off South West, she was uncommunicative wishing to get the whole distasteful trip over and return to the air conditioned luxury of LG3.
"Camel trail" I pointed, Stanley turned right and we descended toward an oasis with a few shacks, 
"The Arabs live at these Oasis selling dates and their wives and daughters bodies for sex and know nothing better it is fascinating"�we landed and left the Bell, Rebekah lagged behind, and I recognised from her photograph a black lady wearing only a loin lady approaching.
"Mrs Gratani"? I asked.
�"Are you really the Big Boss Mr McGuire."she asked incredulously.
"I sure am, have you explained to Mr Uzamu what is required," I asked. 
"Yes sir, and you will take me home?" 
"Of course" She would be delightful company.
Rebekah remained aloof uninterested, disgusted by the filth, the degradation, appalled that I should be speaking to a black prostitute, friendly with her even, she did not have a clue what was coming.
"Rebekah, meet Mrs Gratani, Mrs Gratani, Mrs Stephens, Mrs Gratani is our interpreter for today." 
"Well" said Mrs Gratani, "this is Oasis and Prostitute place and Goat trough where the animals can eat,"
She pointed to the stinking brown water,"This free water for animals and prostitutes, The clean well water very precious so is sold to travellers, come see how people live."
Rebekah looked on in disgusted disinterest.
I entered the shed, "Prostitute Goat Shed" announced Mrs Gratani as she entered the gloom, I found a rusty metal collar linked to a chain attached to an eye in the floor, I had a thirteen millimeter bolt and two nuts with two spanners in my pocket and as she entered&nbsp; I playfully grabbed the collar and clamped it round Rebekah's neck.�
"Hey that's not funny she said, but I got the bolt through and a nut on before she realised and tightened it, pulling the second nut up behind as a lock nut,.
"Yes they would capture women and wear them down till they agreed to be prostitutes, usually in two days or less." 
"Yeah How"&nbsp; she asked.
"No Fuck no drink"��I pointed out reasonably.

"No"
 "Oh yes, now it is very hot and you are sweating and the floor is camel dung so I suggest you take the jacket off", 
Quickly Mrs Gratani and I removed Rebekah's Jacket and boots Pants and pantyhose," Prostitutes traditionally remain naked."�
"I am no prostitute" wailed Rebekah as she struggled increasingly desperately.
"Then you will die of dehydration, It's no different to screwing all those guys at the tennis club."
Mrs Gratani continued to strip Rebekah of her blouse bra and panties.
"Right, I handed the tools to a Black guy, "This is Mr Uzamu, your pimp, and he will get you a drink after the first fuck, Oh don't escape and don't run away you will die of dehydration or sun stroke in the desert.
Rebekah knew it was a joke, except it was not, she would learn humility,the hard way.
"Wagons roll I called, "Oh Mrs Gratani, put these on" 
She dressed in Rebekah's pants and Jacket and we took of heading East.�
We dropped Mrs Gratani by the brothel at the crossroads where she worked and set off north.
Back at the Landing ground I spent a while looking around the facilities, then a 747 the 100 seat freight and passenger variant came through and I had a good look round .
It had Rolls stickers on three engines and Pratt on the other a nice touch, It thundered into the western sky in the dusk and after an early Dinner I headed for bed. Alone.

Next day we visited Rebekah she sat morosely in the shack, dirty with dust, skid marks and shit round her arse "they tried to rape me," 
"So, you are a prostitute now." 
"I fought the off".�"
Are you Thirsty". 
"Yes of course", she replied, her perfect lips were cracking and the make up was flaking off her perfect face. 
"See you, sometime."
"No, look a joke is a joke." 
"No joke, we sold you to the Pimp, this is your life now.
She just looked stunned.
We flew back. to LG3.� 
We returned the next day, she was really in a bad way,she had streaks of goat shit on her and she was almost begging me to take her away, but the third day there was a change, she looked cleaner, a filthy jug filled with water.
"Ah you saw the light" I said, her bruised cunt lips and the trail of dried cum down her leg spoke volumes.
"I did what I had to." 
"Did you enjoy it?" I asked.
 "No I could have Aids." she whined.
"Poor you.". 
"What did you want me to sign?" she asked.
"Oh no matter." She could suffer.
"They raped me, four of them, held me down, spread me, took me, this is what you want to hear, isn't it."
"You might enjoy it, in time, keep in the shade sunburn can be nasty."
"Took me in the filth, forcing, shooting their filth, everywhere, my mouth my bottom."
"You will get used to it, Mrs Gratani is very skilled, perhaps I shall ask her to give you some tips."
We flew off but spotted camels approaching so we set down again,�Stanley and Bill took the rifles in case of trouble and stayed by the Chopper. I entered the Hut and removed my pants, I heard Mr Uzamu, discussing something with the men then shadows in the doorway, I hauled up my pants "Vere Good Fuck, Vere Good, do one time more when ready." and I watched as in total humilliation Rebekah furiously attempted to get herself moist for the intruder who raised his robes and thrust his filthy prick straight into her, he withdrew, and his friend did the same then a third and a fourth, they left. 
"You enjoyed that?" she asked 
"I sure did" my balls ached "How is the new job" 
"Yeah Ok", then the bravado fell away, "what are you going to do to me" she cried, 
"Nothing, this is it, simple country life"� I made my excuses and left.� 
We called on Mrs Gratani on the way home and took her into the desert, erected a small tent and in it she took away the needs Rebekah had aroused in me, I don't think she had seen a Condom before but she was absolute master or should it be mistress of her trade and I felt wonderful, we collected the tent and took her home, 
"Mrs Gratani, have you a first name" I asked,
"Barbera, but only very close friends call that me" she replied, 
"Well I think we are friends so may I call you Barbera and you call me Norm,"� 
"Bye Norm" she called and waved happily. as we flew away .

On the fourth day we called for Barbera first, and after finding customers about an hour from the Oasis we set down at the Oasis, 
Barbera spoke to Mr Uzamu and we took a groundsheet into the Shack, "hey Rebekah that sure was a turn on yesterday, so I brought Barbera along in case I needed relief. ,Barbera wore just the loin cloth so I copped a feel of her cunt and kissed her cheek as the sound of Voices approached. Barbera went to negotiate I did the pants trick again, 5 guys this time she looked resigned and held her sex open for them. she had reached rock bottom or so she thought.
The men left. 
We fetched a medical kit and thee gallon cans of water a shovel and a funnel from the chopper, I dug a gallon can size hole by the shack.
Medical tests, first something for energy, I gave her chocolate which she ate ravenously, then water, she drank about half a gallon of sweet water then said she was full, I disagreed and as Barbera and I held her down I tipped another half gallon down her throat.
Her belly distended and she wet herself, then she realised she was unwell and diarrhoea streamed from her arse, I dragged her outside but the chain stopped her. I had spanners in my pocket so I released the collar and dragged her to the hole where we set the funnel in the empty gallon tin and told her to pee in it, she could not so we made her drink another half gallon.&nbsp; The piss flowed and Barbera and I spread the groundsheet and she expertly guided me into her sopping hole wrapping her legs round me and urging me to fuck her harder, Rebekah looked completely crushed, she staggered back into the gloom, 
It was time to leave.
"Oh Bekky, old Uzamu can't pronounce Rebekah so we renamed you Fuck White, Ok," 
She burst into tears. Next day was her last in the desert, we knew some traders were headed her way and we had done deals with them so we arranged for Mr Uzamu to sell Rebekah to them,� 
He told my interpreter later how she begged to stay with him, but he could not resist the twenty dollars they paid for her.
We saw them approach the Oasis and put the Chopper behind a dune while we waited for them, we waited by the track and in a spirited display of bartering we bought her for twenty eight dollars. 
Her relief was absolute, even when we set up a tent and we all queued up and screwed her one after another, a proper lads bonding session you might say.
She tried to look away when I screwed her, but fair play I have had worse fucks.
She seemed almost grateful when I took her to the chopper, we lashed her to the port skid as she stunk too much for the cabin, and she threw up a surprising amount considering how little she had supposedly eaten, and we landed a mile or two from the Landing ground released her, dressed her in a boiler suit and let her walk the last bit.
