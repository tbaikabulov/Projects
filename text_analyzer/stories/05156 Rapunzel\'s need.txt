Rapunzel,
Rapunzel let down your hair.

&nbsp;

There
were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a child. 

At
length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire. These people had
a little window at the back of their house from which a splendid garden could
be seen, which was full of the most beautiful flowers and herbs. It was,
however, surrounded by a high wall, and no one dared to go into it because it
belonged to an enchantress, who had great power and was dreaded by all of the known world.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Each
night the man and woman spent the hours before sleep overtook them, trying
again and again to bear the child they so wished for.� As the sultry summer nights slipped past
softly, like warm rain, the couple filled the humid, soft, twilight hours with
a wild deperate sexual desire, born of the animal within their souls urging
them to create life.� Their minds filled
with hope, their bodies entwined in lust.

The
scent of magnolia and jasmine flooded through the open shutters lifting their
senses, the very escence of sensuality its smell urging on their passion to
wilder heights, as we look upon the room where this story begins we see a
darkened room just a few candles with wax sliding down their silken sides
illuminated the small room, that was dominated by the large bed at its
centre.� As the candles watched the
couple they flickered with a slight breeze which swirled in through the
window.� And cast against the dull white
stone wall beside the bed, was� a tangle of limbs a bucking beastly
image carnal and old as time itself.

Beads
of perspiration dripping off of their firm tender flesh, his hard muscular
frame hovered over hers, his face a concentration of pleasure and frustration,
she looked up with violet hued eyes her lashes dark as night, her pupils
dilated with desire, she blinked slightly as she looked up at him and a small
strained smile passed her bowlike soft inviting lips.� She gasped slightly as he drove his length
deep into her, arching her smooth supine back, as he rent her opening apart,
she felt as if her whole being engulfed �him in that moment her sweet tight
little pussy filled to its utmost. �He
looked into her tender young face, only just starting to show a few lines of
age, if he looked closely. Wondering if she would ever blossom with child for
him, if this enchanting beauty was a shell whose breasts would never swell and
burgeon, aching with nourishing milk, perhaps no seed would ever implant itself
and grow inside of her deep dark womb. He drove harder into her at the thought,
determined to plant his seed as deep within her as he could, he lifted her legs
and drove all 10 inches hard into her, he looked at her with a little pity as
her slender small body was thrust with his hardness again and again, he forced
himself in her over and over and over, his manhood slamming into her sometimes
he could feel the cervix as he fucked her hole relentlessly, and as she started
to become distressed, he held a hand over her mouth, so that the maid would not
be woken by his wives desperate pleading and screams, as the onslaught onto her
tight little vagina showed no signs of stopping.� He propelled himself into her slamming,
slapping and ramming her � poor sweet beautiful woman.� He consoled himself that it was what she
needed, that if she was going to blossom with his fruit, then she must endure
the most vital inavasion of her tight warmth, to give them the best chance of
conceiving. His large workmans hand calloused and hard wrapped itself over her
mouth as he forced his rock hard phallous�
deep into her drenched contracting sheath shuddering, his muscles
clenching as he drove in a final time deep into her, her screams muffled as he
shot his hot whiteness up deep inside.

&nbsp;

And
so every day they went about their normal business, working eating, talking
with their neighbours and friends, gossiping and living.� And come twilight they would relive this
ritualistic sexuality, night after night went by until summer turned to autumn
and as the leaves fell away from the trees, so did their hope start to dissipate
and their night time activities became more fevered and frenzied with the
desperation of their endeavours.� And so
winter came and with the soft white fall of the first snow, so their hearts
became cold a soft frost entwined about their hearts deep inside them, they
began to dread the nights coming now, so cold and lost to them was the pleasure
in the passion.� Every night they carried
the candlesup the steps to their bedroom, and his enchanting wives slight body
would procede him up the stairs.� As he
watched her graceful figure move ever more slowly as she sighed� softly between her lips, wishing for
the time to sleep to come hither now, and the assault on her tired sore body to
end now, but she would not give up this sweet maiden, because having a child
meant so very much to them both, and so she bore it all and struggled on, day
after day.

&nbsp;

One
morning the lady opened her eyes to see shadows flickering on the ceiling, and
a scent availed her, as she rubbed her eyes softly in anticipation of a new
day, the smell enticed her it beckoned to her it spoke a promise that she could
not understand.� All she knew was that it
made her feel enriched, her bussoms started to firm and her nipples harden a
little, as she stretched her feline frame, and started to head towards the
wondow.

&nbsp;

She
flung upon the shutters with abandon and saw that spring was upon the valley,
song birds dipped and glided, building and nesting� continuing the eternal circle of
life.� The trees promising a sprinkling
flush of blossom, its buds nurtured by the fresh spring showers and
sunlight.� Where could this beguiling
scent be coming from she pondered, standing by this window and looking down
into the enchantresses garden, she saw a bed which was planted with the most
beautiful rampion - rapunzel, and it looked so fresh and green that she longed
for it, and had an all consuming desire to eat some.

She
slipped on some shoes, and pattered down to the garden.� The scent led her to the wall that surrounded
the garden, and she could smell it entrancing her senses more and more as she
got closer.� I must have the plant that makes
my head ache with longing, my heart beat faster, a hunger grew deep in her
belly, and she pined to taste it.

&nbsp;

As
the days passed the woman grew pale and wan, she was listless in her movements,
and she couldn�t bear to eat a thing.�
�My love, what ails thee? I cannot bear to see you so my beautiful wife,
please tell me what I can do to make thee well again�.� Her husband said to her

There
is a plant rampion that is growing on the other side of the wall my love, every
morning it calls to me, I must eat it my love or I shall fade away and die,
without it I cannot live.

&nbsp;

The
man knew that he must break the unspoken rule and climb over and pick this
plant for his wife, for he could not bear to lose her he loved her so. Let it
cost me what it will but I must save my wife, he said to himself as he
clambered over the stone wall into the enchanted garden, he hastily clutched a
handful of the rampion, and climbed back over as fast as he could. 

&nbsp;

He
took it to her, and watched as she made a salad with it and ate it greedily her
hands moving quickly from her plate to the full lips, gorging herself on the
plant that tasted so sweet and compelling.�


&nbsp;

That
night as she lay with her husband, she kissed his lips sweetly and looking into
his eyes she smiled and climbed onto him.��
She felt his huge hard cock against her and guided it to her moistened
pussy and slowly she sat down upon him, beginning to rock and moan above him,
using his manhood to please her newly awakened longing for him, her desire for
the rampion almost matched by her desire to fuck this man of hers, to gorge
herself of his juices.� She was so wet it
slid down her legs as she rode him hard then slow then
hard again.� The man unused to this could
barely hold back and with his wives hard nippled locked between his fingers he
came deep inside her, filling her as full as she had ever been, her clit
enlarged and aching she rubbed with her fingers as he came and felt her little
pussy spasm over his length, both drenched with sweat and moaning and squirming
as they sated their passions in� a huge climax.

&nbsp;

The
next morning when she awoke, the hunger withing her was threefold she ached
deep inside her belly and felt sick with need.�
When her husband came home from work she looked even more ill than
ever.� Whatever is wrong now my love? He
asked.� I cannot bear it, she sobbed, I
must have more of the plant more than before, it is torturing me my love I have
to have it.

&nbsp;

Once
again the man went at twilight to the wall in the garden, and climbed over
awkwardly, in his heart he knew the danger and was so frightened that he felt
sick and his heart pounded hard within his chest.� Once again over the imposing wall he crouched
and creeped towards the rampion.� All of
a sudden he saw her, The Enchantress, his heart almost stopped in fear as he
gazed mesmerised by her ever dark eyes.

&nbsp;

�HOW
DARE YOU PATHETIC MORTAL, HOW DARE YOU STEAL FROM MY GARDEN!!!�� She shouted at him in a voice that could shake
the leaves off a tree or cause an avalanche in the mountains.� �You shall suffer for your impudence little man, you shall suffer the consequences of your actions.� She
whisperd now, a whisper that could cut through the air, a whisper that made
your skin crawl with fear.

&nbsp;

�Enchantress
please, he begged, I do not take this for myself, I take it for my wife who has
become sick, and who needs this plant to cure her ails.�

&nbsp;

�Is
this so?� she said looking down upon the man knelt before her, �well if you love
her so very much, then you shall do whatever it takes to get this plant every
day wont you little man?�

&nbsp;

�Yes
madam enchantress he said, anything you please, I will be your slave do
anything you say, but please keep my wife alive.�

&nbsp;

�I
have three tasks little man that you must complete before I grant you your
wish�. And they are not debatable.�
Complete these tasks or you and your wife will perish at my hands.�

&nbsp;

�Anything
enchantress, anything at all� he said.

&nbsp;

�the
first is that you must come here at dusk every night to collect the rampion,
and you will spend one hour in my service and you will do whatever I say,
whatever twisted pleasure I have you will serve my slightest whim.� You will do this for three days, by the end
of this time your wife will be well, and no longer need the plant.�

�The
second thing is that when you go back to your wife after leaving here you must
never tell her of the things we have done, and you will take her to the bedroom
and you will fuck your pretty little wife in exactly the way I have told you to
that night.�

&nbsp;

�the third involves my foresight into the future, your wife
will bear three children, all girls, the firstborn child you will hand over to
me as soon as she is born.� I swear I
will take good care of her and train her to take over my position, she will be
given every advantage in life, but you will never see her again.�

&nbsp;

The
man knelt at the enchantresses feet sobbing into his hands, he knew there was
nothing he could do, he had to obey this evil witches whims or his love his
wife would surely die, he knew now that this must have been a trap she had set
to gain a child and to enslave them, making them have no choice but to obey
her.

&nbsp;

�Yes
enchantress I understand, I will do all as you say, and for the next week I am
yours every evening. �I will degrade my
wife in any way you see fit, and our firstborn �..yes
I shall hand her to you, I do not take this lightly nor is it something I wish
to do, not any of it, but I am aware of your power and I know if I do not
comply I shall be undone.�

&nbsp;

�
I see you
are an obedient little man, and that will surely stand you in good stead for my
little games.� Remember do NOT disobey me
or I will put a spell on the rampion and your wife will perish as she eats it
with her greedy little slutty mouth.��
She laughed loudly then.� � Did you notice a change in your wife little man? Are her
eyes twinkling, and her breasts fuller, her ass seems fuller and perter, and
her pussy is tight and juicy as a peach isn�t it?�

&nbsp;

�ye-yes
enchantress� he stuttered 

&nbsp;

�your
wife is blossoming from the spellbound rampion you have fed her, soon she will
be so ripe and full that she will make lust race in your eyes and heart when
you see her, you wont be able to look upon her without needing to fill up her
hungry little cunt, and after a while as she blossoms you will succeed in
impregnating her, like the little cow that she is, born to be pregnant and feed
her young with those huge round udders of hers.�

&nbsp;

Unaccustomed
to this kind of talk the man was confused and embarrassed, yet he felt his cock
grow hard as rock as she spoke to him this way, his trousers giving this fact
away to the evil enchantress stood before him.�
He saw the laughter in her eyes as she watched him blush, and squirm a
little, shame filling him but lust not far behind.

&nbsp;

He
gazed upon the powerful woman in front of him, and felt desire lift him.� She was� incredibly beautiful, with long
flowing red hair the colour of poppies, her skin white as fresh snow looked so
incredibly soft and unmarred by any blemish.�
Under her silken robe dress, he could see the volumptous body hinted at
beneath, her breasts large and full, her nipples hard and jutting outwards
against the dress, her legs silhouetted were long and curvaceous, and he could
smell her womanhood even from where he knelt, a sweet subtle glutinous smell,
that made him so hard that his cock throbbed with an unbearable need.

&nbsp;

She
watched him struggle with his lust and his fear quietly for a while, then broke the silence�

�And
now I think we should begin your first lesson don�t you little man?� she said
chuckling to herself.

&nbsp;

She
raised her hand and suddenly he felt his clothes fall away from his skin like
they were just a part of the breeze that lightly whipped around them, and he
felt a tightening around his neck as something twined itself around him and a
tentacle of this strange rope like silken material danced around him and
finally floated into her upheld hand, and he realised she had effectively put a
collar and lead on him like the farmers do an animal that needs to be led.

&nbsp;

She
led him on his knees to a stone alter of some kind that was shrouded by sweet
smelling trees, and all around it were stood dark statues of grotesque sexual
gratification, frozen and held in time by stone.� Yet they looked like real people that had
been fucking or being used or held captive and punished, but all were sexual
and in each statue one figure was clearly master and one clearly a slave at
their mercy.� The stone plinth had vines
entwined and growing around its sides, and he could swear he saw them moving
slightly.

&nbsp;

He
climbed up onto the plinth his naked flesh abrased by the rough rock beneath
him,� and as he
lay back as instructed, he heard a whispering sound and as he looked to one
side, saw the vines moving.� They bagan to encircle his wrists and ankles, imprisoning him,
starting to pull him tightly into a reluctant star position.� Once his body was pulled as tightly as the
vines could he lay there breathing heavily, his muscular chest rising and
falling rapidly.�
His body exposed in this bizarre setting for any who came there to see,
but the only watchers were The Enchantress, and the ghastly statues that seemed
to moan and breathe around him.� Then he
felt a tingling sensation like a tickle passing up and down his body, and as he
struggled to look down at himself he saw three vines trailing and caressing his
body.� 

&nbsp;

Then
he felt a poking at his anus, No, NO he moaned to himself, Please No.� As the vine started to insistently push at
his tight hole, it seemed thicker and tighter than the others, and it kept
poking at his virginal entrance.� No one
had ever touched him there, he was a proud man and
believed that his body was sacred.� More
insistently now the vine poked at him, its pointed end slipping a little inside,
and coming out again, over and over again, and after a few minutes he felt it
insistently pushing a little further in each time, as he lay there moaning with
embarrassment and discomfort.� 

He
looked across to see The Enchantress watching him smiling, she was playing with
her breast through the thin silk of her azure dress, softly moaning to herself
as her body grew more aroused, watching his pitiful body be invaded by the
persistant vines, deeper and deeper into his hole it began to fuck him, and
just as he started to get used to the torment and relax against it slightly,
the other vines began to lightly whip his body.�
He cried out in pain as the vines bit into his flesh again and again,
and the vine in his ass started to fuck his hole harder and harder, the
intensity building up and up, as he felt himself filled to the brim, and the
pain seared up inside him as though it was tearing him apart inside, the heat
and friction almost unbearable now, and he couldn�t help but shout and scream
for it to stop, a few soft pathetic tears staining his face.

&nbsp;

Then
the Enchantress moved closer to him, standing over him, the vines never once
touching her cool icy flesh as it shimmered in the soft moonlight,� she had removed her gown now, and he could
see her magnificent high rounded breasts, and the tight little waist which
flares down to full hips and curvaceous thighs.�
He shuddered a little inspite of himself and
groaned as he realised his cock was achingly hard for her, thickened with his
coursing blood.� She reached her hand
down and with her long nails traced over his length up and down, the touch
making the pain of the whipping and his violated ass feel somehow more
bearable.� He groaned louder as she
stroked his wet end with her finger tip and he felt the vine inside him fuck
him ever harder, pounding in and out of him now, the� whipping vines flinging themselves
back and then slepping hard against his burning hot abused flesh.� Slowly she circled his cock in her hand and
started to pull on his painfully hard throbbing erection, and as she pulled and
stroked, his ass relaxed into the motion, and he could feel his body given into
the torturous agonising pleasure of it all.�
The heat, pain, and excitement, building within him,
as he crashed to a climax.� His
come shooting out of him all across his chest and face, gushing out of
him,� his body spasmed wildly, his ass
clenching onto the fuckvine that was still relentlessly probing him, he
screamed in rage and pleasure as he came, and felt a release in the pain and
pleasure all of a sudden.� And shaking
and shivering he felt his muscles begin to relax into it, just as the vines
stopped ther wild thrashing over his bruised and sore body.� The fuck vine gradually
slowing, and then pulling out.

&nbsp;

When
he finally opened his eyes, he saw The Enchantress leaning over him laughing
softly to herself, her fingertips pushing his hair back from his face.� She bent closer and whispered into his
ear�� �That was lesson one, the teaching
of how pain can cause pleasure within your mortal body.� You will go home, and feed your wife the
plant she so desperately needed, and then you will take her upstairs and bind
her exactly as you were bound, and u will fuck her tight little ass, while u
whip her breasts arms and legs she will cry and beg for you to stop, but if you
do then tomorrow she will not be able to have the rampion, it will have
withered and died, and soon after so would she.�

&nbsp;

�Go
now and do as you have been instructed, and come back to me tomorrow at� dusk, for your
second lesson.�

&nbsp;

He
trembled violently as he felt his bindings fall away from him, and watched the
enchantress drifting off back to the castle.�
He looked down at his body and saw red welts across his chest thighs and
arms, and inside his hole he felt sore, aching and open.� Violated and aching he slunk back to the
cottage, knowing the nightmare was not over yet, he had to violate his wife in
the most demeaning way, and he was unsure as to how he could bring himself to
do it to her.

&nbsp;

As
he entered the house she rushed at him, grabbing the rampion from his hands,
barely taken in the state of him, she devoured the plant there and then, not
prolonging the agony any longer she crammed the precious (more precious than
she knew now) herb into her succulent mouth.

&nbsp;

Come
upstairs my love, he said tremulously leading her up the steep bare stairs to
their bedroom�

&nbsp;

Take
your clothes off and lay on the bed wife, he whispered in her ear.� While she stripped off displaying her body,
lush with the hormones in the rampion, her breasts tight within their skin
seemed perter and doughier than normal, her nipples sticking out erect and
achingly sexual, her skin shimmered a pale alabaster glowed with an untold
luminescence. 

&nbsp;

�As he watched her he felt his cock harden to
an aching tightness, throbbing within the binding of his trousers.� He imagined his leather strap slapping
against her skin and his cock deep in her ass, something he would never have
dreamt of before, and his cock throbbed and ached, he realised suddenly he was
going to enjoy this, and wondered at his feelings.

&nbsp;

She
lay naked and lushious on the bed, her arms raised
behind her head, her long hair spread across the pillow.�� He advanced towards her and pulled the vine
he had in his deep pockets, and looked into her violet eyes.� �Do you trust me dear wife� he asked, to
which she of course replied innocently, of course my love, always and forever.

&nbsp;

He
started to tie her wrists and and although she looked frightened didn�t try to
stop him, he wound the vine around her wrists and ankles just as it had been on
his body, and tied her to the corners of the bed, he could barely breathe for
excitement, sucking in the air as he watched her slight sexy body strain
against her bonds.

&nbsp;

What-
what�s going to happen my love? She asked in a timid little
voice�

It
was then that he started to tell her what had happened in the garden when he
went to fetch the rampion, she gasped and shuddered as he explained the ordeal
he had gone through, and when he came to what was going to happen to her she
turned so white he feared she would pass out.

&nbsp;

She
looked into his eyes then and asked that he blindfold and gag her so that he
would not see her eyes nor hear her cries� it�s for the best my love she said,
and so he did as requested.� She wriggled
and tensed as he wound a scarf over her eyes then stuffed one into her mouth.

&nbsp;

He
stood over her for a second, then stripped off his clothes, watching her on the
bed as he did so, squirming with fear and anticipation.� His skin felt alive with nerve endings after
the lashing he had received, and his hole still felt open and sore, but with
all this came a new awareness of his body, and he felt incredibly turned on,
and even looking forward to stretching his wives tiny ass up and whipping the tender
skin of her delicious body�����.

&nbsp;

To
be Continued�..
