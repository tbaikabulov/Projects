Synopsis: How Jennifer becomes a slave






Slave-
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Please arrive at dinner ten minutes late completely naked

Your Master
Stephen Williamson

P.S. That is of course with the exception of your chastity belt.

Jennifer could not believe that Master Stephen expected her to come to dinner in only her chastity belt on the night her parents were coming to dinner. She knew that they would find out about her special relationship with Master Stephen eventually, but she had hoped to do it in a subtle way. She knew that her parents would not understand the complexity of the relationship. Hell, she thought to herself, half the time even I don&#8217;t understand our relationship. It was a love-hate relationship. She loved it when she was being rewarded and 
hated it when she was being punished.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Jennifer had always known that she was somewhat submissive. She didn&#8217;t know what to do with that information. She was afraid of what would happen if that information fell into the wrong hands. When she was in high school and became sexually active she was always willing to do what the other girls weren&#8217;t willing to do.

This got her reputations with the boys and the girls. The boys all thought that she was great, and best of all she was a free fuck with no strings attached.&nbsp; Also she gave great blow jobs and was more than willing to take it up the ass. The girls all thought that she was a nasty whore.

Her junior year she got her first taste of pure domination. There was this guy named Jason that she had the hots for bad, but he thought that she was too loose. This was his first year at the school as he had just moved to Indiana from Florida, but he had heard rumors that she would and practically had slept with anything with a penis.

Jason wasn&#8217;t into open relationships. He expected commitment from his partners. Jennifer begged and pleaded Jason to be her boyfriend. 

�Please Jason I&#8217;m begging you to at least give me a chance. I&#8217;ll do anything for you,� begged Jennifer, and every word was true. At that moment she was willing to do anything to get Jason to agree to go out with her.

She needed Jason because he presented a challenge for her. All the other guys were easy, Jason was different. She was drawn to him and she didn&#8217;t know why. 

Jason had to think about what to do about Jennifer, He knew that she was submissive, and that she was attracted to him because of his naturally dominant side. He also knew that Jennifer was in for a rude awakening because it would not be all fun and games. He decided to write her a letter.

Jennifer-
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You may not realize it my dear, but you are a very submissive person, and I could be a good match for you. I am a very dominant person by nature. You said that you were willing to anything if I were willing to become your boyfriend. Well I am going to take you up on that. If I am to become your boyfriend then you are going to have to submit yourself fully to me. You have a wonderful gift to offer to me and others like me, but it needs to be nurtured. Do realize that I am NOT playing, and please don&#8217;t waste my time. If you are uninterested I fully understand. If you are interested then you will call me. 

Choose Wisely
Jason Mongol
875-2453


Jennifer could not believe her good fortune when she received Jason&#8217;s letter. She read it without really paying attention to what it said. All she got out of it was that if she wanted him to be her boyfriend then she had to call him.

Jason wasn&#8217;t sure if he was happy or not when his phone rang. He already knew that it was Jennifer. He hoped that she had actually read the letter and understood exactly what he wanted. He decided to see how far she was willing to take this.

-Hello slut
- Jennifer was shocked and did not reply.
- Did you actually read the letter, slut? You had better answer me truthfully.
- Why do you keep calling me slut? You have no right to do that. You don&#8217;t even really know me, and of course I read the letter. How else would I have known to call you?
- Perhaps you should read it again little one, and if you wish to continue this relationship I would strongly suggest you not use that tone of voice with me again. Since you obviously did not comprehend what the letter said let me dumb it down for you. If you want a relationship with me then you will be my slave and I will be your master. If you are willing to agree to those terms come to my house at noon tomorrow.

With that he hung up the phone. He wasn&#8217;t sure how she was going to react. He was afraid that she might got to the police or something. He was hoping that she was aware of her submissive side. 

Jennifer was surprised. Jason was the first guy to see what she truly was. She craved to be dominated, but she needed to be sure he knew what he was doing first. He seemed to know quite a bit about the kind of relationship that she was looking for. She had been quite surprised when he had jumped right into his dominant role, but now she realized that he had been testing her. She realized that she needed Jason to be her Master. She knew that she was going to go to his house tomorrow. 

Jason was pacing around the house nervously. Luckily his parents were not home so they did not witness his awkward behavior. He was afraid she wouldn&#8217;t show, and at the same time afraid that she would show. 

Jennifer pulled up in front of Jason&#8217;s house at eleven fifty. She was still unsure as to whether or not she really wanted to go through with this or not. She finally decided to just go through with it before she could change her mind. She got out of the car and walked to the door, and she would have turned and ran except he was standing in the door way with his arms crossed and a cross expression on his face.

�You&#8217;re late,� he growled. He knew that she had been there for a while, but all that mattered to him was when she finally had the guts to come to the door.

�Please sir, can you please give me another chance? I won&#8217;t let you down again,� she cried. 

�I don&#8217;t believe I ever said that you blew this chance. I simply stated that you were late. It is twelve ten and you were instructed to arrive promptly at noon. I am, however, concerned about your health. You pulled up at eleven fifty which means that it took you twenty minutes to get from the driveway to the front door,� spat Jason.

�I&#8217;m sorry Sir I just assumed that I had blown my chances with you because you seemed angry. I do not have a medical condition Sir. I was simply debating whether or not to go through with this,� croaked Jennifer.

�Well if I choose to accept you as my slave you will be punished for your tardiness. Now please follow me,� snapped Jason. Following that he stepped into the house, waited for her to enter, and shut the door. He then lead her upstairs to his room.
Jennifer was surprised by how plain his room was. It was spotless and there were no posters or anything on the walls. It was obvious that very little time was spent in the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
