Sylvie looked once more at the barn. It had
obviously been deserted for many years, cobwebs were abundant, holes in the
walls were in need of repair, and the rusted lock had come away in her hands.
This is where she planned her next escapade. Far from prying
eyes, except the road from the trees to the barn. Half
a mile where she could be discovered. 

&nbsp;

Could she do this? Could she take the risk?

&nbsp;

In her work life� Sylvie was an executive with an
advertising firm. Any form of bad publicity would get her fired, even though
she had been with the company for twelve years. She knew the risks, but was she
able to take them?

&nbsp;

The barn was well over thirty miles from
her own home, so the chances of her being recognised were slim, but she knew
the possible exposure could get her arrested if she was caught and exposed.

&nbsp;

A short half a mile, that could mean the
end of all she held so dear.. but
her longing to try this was overwhelming. She knew, even though the risks were
great, that she just had to do it.

&nbsp;

She went back to her car and drove home
slowly, not wanting to raise a commotion, not wanting to be seen today, if only
so that were she seen later, no one would be able to report her car.

&nbsp;

The drive was uneventful, and Sylvie
arrived home safely, though somewhat excited. She had seen no-one on the
country road, and was feeling slightly more easy about
what she was planning.

&nbsp;

She had a week�s holiday in which to do
this, not that she would take a week, she simply wanted the leisure time in
which to do it and recover. She could already feel� her pussy was dripping, but she had
made a deal with herself, no sex of any form until this was over. The vibrator
was spending lonely nights in her pantie drawer, not its usual home.

&nbsp;

Sylvie checked her bag to make sure
everything she wanted was there. The one aspect that worried her was the
enormous butt plug she had bought from the internet recently. She had never had
anything so big in her life, but, that was part of the plan. New
ideas, new tasks, and new toys.

&nbsp;

Picking up her bag Sylvie left the house
and locked the door, pausing to put the padlock and cuff keys through the mail
box. Now, if she really went through with this, she could not release herself
until she reached home again.

&nbsp;

She had considered actually leaving the
keys on the kitchen table, but then thought that posting them through her own
mail box would be a part of the ordeal itself, a willing act, one to show she was committed to it.

&nbsp;

The thirty mile drove back to the barn was
quiet, she saw no-one, and she hoped no-one had seen her. The barn loomed in
front of her, the light of the day fading fast as she drove through the open
barn doors.

She had brought a brand new padlock for the
barn door with her, to safe guard her car, and also to ensure that she would
not be able to get easy release once she had started the task. The keys to the
padlock were placed in a waste bin to one side of the barn, out of sight,. This would ensure no passer bye would open the barn door
and steal her car, and her means of getting home.

&nbsp;

The path she wanted started half a mile up
the road, and so picking up her rucksack she started out on her treck. The
night sky was almost black, no moon, and few starts visible. Her hearing seemed
much more acute as she walked the lane, hearing the wind blow in the trees
almost as if she were standing under them, but they were a quarter of a mile
away. There is a marked difference between country and city. No light
pollution, no sounds. Save the natural sounds of the cattle in the distance
mooing, and an occasional dog barking in the distance.

&nbsp;

At last, Sylvie found the turn off she was
looking for, and checking that there was no-one about, she lit her flashlight,
showing her the thin muddy trail she was traverse. Gingerly she stepped onto
the path, and left the road behind her. 

&nbsp;

It was only now she could hear the strange
sounds of the country side. Owls hooting in trees, mud squelching beneath her
feet, each seem amplified in the darkness of the night. A slight drizzle had
started before Sylvie had left the road, but the weather forecast for the night
had been pretty good. She knew that on her return the ground would be much more muddy, but she had accepted this, and ignored the light
rain as it fell on her.

&nbsp;

He clothes became wet, but that didn�t
matter, she was soon to leave them behind.�
She looked at her watch, the face hard to distinguish, even though it
was supposed to be illuminated. She thought it said 11.45, and wondered how
much longer to her target.

&nbsp;

The rain started to fall a little heavier,
and Sylvie wished she had brought an umbrella, though what good that would do
on the return journey, Sylvie was unsure. She felt a smile on her lips, which
turned to laughter as she realised that no matter what protection she could
have brought, it was not going to make any difference on the way back.

&nbsp;

Another hour, and
Sylvie finally reached her destination. During the day it was a small clearing,
but at night, it was just somewhere she could begin her task. The darkness hid
the fact that she was surrounded by trees, trees with thorns. If Sylvie made
any mistakes, she would be stabbed by thorns, and she already knew that they
would hurt, having deliberately brushed against them when she had planned this
ordeal.

&nbsp;

It was now or never for Sylvie. Slowly, she
undressed, feeling� the
weight of the wet clothes leave her as she stripped. The jumper she had worn
was thrown in one direction, the trousers in another. Her panties were sent
flying in a direction Sylvie could not even see, and her bra in the opposite
direction. The last thing Sylvie had to dispose of,
was the flashlight. If she threw this, there was no chance until morning of
finding the clothes she had strewn about. .

&nbsp;

Reluctantly, Sylvie brought her arm back
holding the flashlight, and with a single movement, launched it, regretting as
she did so that she had done, but exhilerated� at the same time. Even if she didn�t
carry out the rest of her task, she would now have to find her way naked back
to her car.

&nbsp;

Sitting in the clearing Sylvie opened her
ruck sack, and felt inside for the things she wanted. The first thing would be
the gag, easy to identify, easy to apply. She opened her mouth wide, and felt
the ball gag bury itself in her mouth, passing the straps behind her, and
pulling them tight, ensuring the gag would not fall out, or be pushed out.

&nbsp;

As she pulled out the first piece of rope,
Sylvie wished she had kept the flashlight a little longer, if only to see what
she was doing, but it was too late for that now. By feel alone she looped the
rope around her chest just under her larger than average breasts, and tied a
knot, before passing the rope around herself again,
just over the breasts, and securing it t the front. She knew that even as she
pulled the rope down and under the rope under her breast and pulled it tight,
it would squeeze her breasts, and that they would harden. She had practised this so many time with the lights on and with the lights off,
until she could perfect it in the dark. And perfect it she did. By the time
Sylvie had finished. Her tits were tight and hard. Had she been able to see
them, she would also have seen they had started to turn colour.

&nbsp;

Feeling in the bag she found the butt plug.
She had considered packing lubricant, but had reasoned that in the dark she
would never find it, not with everything else in her ruck sack. Squatting
slightly, Sylvie pressed the end of the plug to her closed ring. She had used
plugs before, but never anything this big. Gritting her teeth, Sylvie started
to press the butt plug at her jewel, the tip forcing her wide, and she moaned
as it slowly forced its way inside her. She was not sure she could do this, but
also knew she had to. Holding the plug in place. The
tip only in her ass, Sylvie�
squatted on the grass, her knees supporting her weight. Slowly. She sank down on it. Screaming as
she felt the huge plug force its way slowly inside her. When squatting
was not getting it any deeper, Sylvie changed positions, and started to sit
down on it, her legs out in front of her, so as not to support her weight, her
weight being held by her arms. It was now or never, and taking the bull by the
horns, she lifted her arms off the floor�feeling her body drive down onto the
plug, driving it deep inside her. He screams were louder than she expected as
she could feel the plug, as if it was ripping her apart. 

&nbsp;

She waited a few minutes
, listening, in case someone had heard her screams and came to assist.
But, no-one came, no sound came rushing at her.

&nbsp;

Slowly, Sylvie stood, the plug deep inside
her, almost splitting her ass in two. But, she knew she would soon get used to
it, and would eject it. Leaning forward she found another piece of rope and
forming a crotch rope, pulled it tight between her legs, holding the plug in
place.

&nbsp;

Sylvie looked at her watch again, it was
almost 2.00 am, and it would be daylight in about three hours.

&nbsp;

Each time Sylvie bent over, she could feel
the butt plug, and knew she had chosen one too big. But there was no escape
now. Even if she cancelled the task, it would be light before she got back to
her car. Feeling in the dark Sylvie found the cuffs with a short chain link
between them. The chain was only six inches long, meaning she would take only
small steps once they were fastened to her ankles. Quickly, before she could
change her mind, Sylvie fastened the cuffs around each of her ankles, knowing
that they keys for these lay behind her front door so many miles away.

&nbsp;

The ruck sack contained only one more item,
another pair of cuffs, with an even shorter chain, two inches. Taking a last
look at her watch, and then throwing the ruck sack into the trees,� Sylvie pressed one
end of the cuffs around her left wrist.. she placed
the other cuffs slowly against her right wrist, one press, and she was trapped,
naked until she got home, and knowing that in a very short time, that daylight
would come. Sylvie also knew, that� even if she didn�t lock the other
cuff, it would make no real difference, she couldn�t walk at normal pace, the
leg irons would make sure of that, and her clothes and the main keys, were lying
behind her door, Sylvie really had no choice, and slowly, placed her hand in
the one loose end of the cuff�and with her other hand�started to close it,
hearing each click as it took� away her
freedom.

&nbsp;

Knowing, now, that her only chance of
freedom was to get back to her car, find the barn key, open the barn and get in
the car, Sylvie started her slow journey. On the way up, she had the
flashlight, and was able to move at any pace she wanted, but now the flashlight
was gone, and the chain between her ankles restricted her ability to walk. This
was not helped by the mud beneath her feet. The rain had not stopped, and in
fact had grown heavier. It was only then that Sylvie had realised that she had
been unaware of this fact, so busy concentrating on her task to notice.

&nbsp;

Within the first twenty yards, Sylvie had
found herself on the ground three times, the mud giving way under her feet.
This was going to be a slow process, much slower than she had originally
planned.

&nbsp;

Sylvie realised very quickly that travelling
along a track. Flashlight in hand, at a free pace, was so very different to
doing the reverse journey, in the dark, and hobbled. Time after time she lost
her footing, her body slowly getting coated in mud. 

&nbsp;

She looked again at her watch, but now was
unable to see the time, as there was mud on the dial. But she could hear birds
singing in the trees, and knew instinctively that dawn was fast approaching.
How far had she come? How much farther to go?�
Was she going to make it to the barn before daylight? Even as she asked
herself this, she knew the answer, she was never going
to make it to the barn in darkness. The hobble and the mud were slowing her
down, though she did not know how far she was behind schedule.

&nbsp;

The first signs of dawn slowly started to
filter through the trees, and thought this made it easier for Sylvie to see
where she was, and where she was going, the hobble still reused to let her move
any faster. A stump of a tree she should have passed long before light came.
Was to her left, which meant by the time she reached the road, it would be
clear daylight.

&nbsp;

Still. She struggled on, trying to move
faster, but simply falling over the hobble, crashing down to the ground. The
rain had stopped, but the mud remained. Sylvie was pleased with herself, at
least the mud was giving her a soft landing..

&nbsp;

At last, Sylvie reached the road, but now
the sun was high overhead, and she knew that the chances of getting seen were
now greatly amplified. But she had no choice, unless she waited for darkness
again. But her stomach was rumbling already, wanting its breakfast cereal, but
not able to partake.

&nbsp;

It was only then that Sylvie started to
feel hunger, nothing drastic yet, but wouldn�t it be nice to sit down in the
comfort of her own home, and eat a bacon sandwich�.the grease covering her
lips, as it slid slowly past her lips.

&nbsp;

Sylvie brought herself back to the moment,
leaving the bacon far behind. Before she could get to the sandwich, she had to
get down this road. The previous night, and the previous times she had walked
this route, it had taken her less than fifteen minutes, but that was without a
hobble restricting her, and, she had not had this dildo in her ass, the dildo
that was now irritating her more than anything she had ever known.

&nbsp;

Had she not tied the crotch rope behind
her, she could have released it and got rid of the plug, but that had never
been an option. She wanted to dildo to stay in until she reached home, and
safety..

&nbsp;

Sylvie was half way down the road, half way
to safety, when her world fell apart. She was so busy concentrating on the road, she didn�t hear the sound until it was too late. Not
the sound of a car, which she had been listening for, but a motorcycle, and
even before she could react and hide, the cycle had past her.

&nbsp;

Sylvie knew instinctively that the rider
must have seen her, and moved closer to the roads edge in an effort to hide.
But, what was the point in hiding, she had already been seen.

&nbsp;

Sylvie worked out in her mind that she
could only be a couple of hundred yard now from the
barn, maybe two hundred yards from safety. She listened, but could not hear the
motorcycle, and decided to make the final effort, moving as fast as her hobbles
would allow. The sun was now bright in the sky, and Sylvie started to feel a
little hungry. She tried to remove the gag as she moved ever slowly towards the
barn, but, it was fastened behind her, and out of each. 

&nbsp;

Eventually, Sylvie saw the barn, only two
hundred yards to go, freedom. She could feel it, taste it, even thought she
still had to drive home in order to release herself. 

&nbsp;

Less than fifty yards, she could taste
freedom. Then suddenly, that noise she had heard earlier resounded in her ears.
The motorcycle. She had been so concentrating on her
imminent release, she had stopped listening, and the sound of the cycle so
close, sent her into a panic.

&nbsp;

Without thinking Sylvie dropped to her
right into some bushes, hardly feeling the thorns from the brambles as she sank
to the ground, hoping she had not been seen.

&nbsp;

The motorcycle engine was close enough for
her to taste the exhaust fumes, so she sank her head down to the ground as far
as she could. After a few minutes the motorcycle started to move away again,
and Sylvie breathed a sigh of relief. She could still hear the engine, not as
close as before, but it meant the rider may be in a position to see her if she
moved to the barn.

&nbsp;

If Sylvie was lucky, the rider would
hopefully assume he had imagined seeing her, but she knew this was a forlorn
hope, he had ridden past her only feet away from her.� That she could still hear his engine meant he
was looking for her. And Sylvie doubted that he would simply want to pass the
time of day with someone as helpless and naked as she was.

&nbsp;

It was just about that time that Sylvie
realised something she had not given ahy thought to at all. She had expected,
or at least hoped, to be home by this time, but now she needed to answer the
call of nature. She could still hear the engine, though she was convinced, now,
that it had moved further way, and yet at the same time was half convinced that
the rider knew where she was, and was sat with his engine idling, waiting for
her to appear.

&nbsp;

Feeling it too dangerous to stand, she lay
on her back and opened her knees as wide as she could. Opening her legs
themselves was out of the question due to the leg irons. At first, nothing,
then a slow warm trickle, before the full thrust of relief. At first she didn�t
realise it, but the puddle was directly between her legs, and was running
backwards towards her. She wanted to get up and run away, but this was never
going to happen. The urine seemed attracted to her, and she knew that as the
sun started to dry the ground and her, she would soon start to smell of it
herself.

&nbsp;

Without realising she was doing it, Sylvie
curled up in a ball, as much as the dildo she now hated would let her. Bringing
her arms up to her head, she rested on them, and felt the hot sun on her naked
body. At least she may get a sun tan, though only on one side. 

&nbsp;

Maybe it was the silence, or had she heard
something. Sylvie was suddenly awake, and the realisation she had actually
slept hit her. It had been a long and tiring night, not to say painful with the
leg irons and the hand cuffs digging into her. But she had not actually
realised she was tired.

&nbsp;

How long had she slept? Minutes?
Hours? She looked at her watch, rubbing it on the
ground to clear the dried mud off the face. It was 6.30, but was that morning
or evening? In summer it was light at both times..

&nbsp;

It was only then that she realised she
could no longer hear the motorcycle engine. At first she convinced herself it
was a trap to lure her out. �damn� she thought to
herself, �getting paranoid� 

&nbsp;

Slowly, she started to raise herself from
the ground. First onto her knees, then into a crouch, ready
to drop again if she saw or heard the cycle or its rider. But only the
silence came back to her. Eventually standing up, feeling the tension in her
legs, she peered through the bramble, to find the farm yard empty. The barn
just a few yards away, the door still closed. At least the car would still be
inside.

Hunger seemed to find a way to torment her,
seeing a sheep on the hillside above her, and relishing how it would taste,
cooked slowly, with a mint or rosemary sauce, new potatoes and fresh
vegetables.

&nbsp;

Sylvie pushed the thought from her mind,
and concentrated on her next move. She knew she couldn�t stay where she was
forever, and now her body ached in so many places. She wanted to be home,
soaking in a hot bath, with hot food inside her. Taking her courage in one
hand, Sylvie slowly moved forwards, ready to fall back to the ground if she saw
or heard anyone. But the yard was deserted. 

&nbsp;

Moving through the bramble, not even
noticing that she was already marked, and getting more of them, she moved to
the edge, one more step and anyone with a view of the yard,
would see her.

&nbsp;

Maybe it was the hunger that drove her.
Maybe the pain now being caused by the huge dildo, but what ever it was, Sylvie
made her decision, and moved clear of the trees, heading slowly and painfully
towards the barn. She kept her ears open in case anything came, but also knew
that as she moved closer to the barn, there was nothing she could do to avoid
detection should someone be close enough.

&nbsp;

The last few yards seemed to take forever,
each second lasting an hour, as she moved towards the barn. Eventually, she was
there, and was moving slowly arund the barn to where she had hidden the padlock
key.

&nbsp;

At first, she panicked, as she couldn�t
find it, but eventually it was in her hands, hands that now shook
uncontrollably. Once more she started to move slowly, back around the barn to
its heavy doors. It took her a few minutes to get the key into the lock, this
task not being aided by her cuffed wrists. But the lock finally came open, and
Sylvie dropped the lock and the keys to the floor.

&nbsp;

With great difficulty, she managed to start
opening the barn doors. Surely they hadn�t been this heavy last night when she
had parked the car in there. But she remembered, the
doors were open when she had arrived, and closing them hadn�t been a problem,
partly, she guessed, as she had been dressed, free and stronger than she felt
right now.

&nbsp;

The task of opening the doors seemed
endless, her ankles now starting to bleed from where the cuffs were digging in
so hard. But at last, they were open enough for her to be able to drive the car
through. Not totally open, but enough.

&nbsp;

Running as fast as the six inch hobble
would allow her, Sylvie reached the safety of her car, only falling over three
times in the process. Once inside the car she opened the glove compartment and
took out the keys, searching also for any long forgotten sweets or chocolate
bars, but there was nothing. 

&nbsp;

Sylvie had always driven an automatic car,
which at this moment was a blessing, as with her feet cuffed only six inches
apart, she would not have been able to handle three pedals. She put the key
into the ignition and started the car, hearing its familiar purr. She was just
about to put the car into gear and drive off, when it dawned on her that she was
still naked. She suddenly realised she had stopped thinking of herself as
naked, but were she seen, someone may call the police and she would be
arrested.

She looked at her watch again. 8.00, she
assumed that was evening, and knew it would still be too light for her to drive
for at least another hour. Another hour sat there helpless,
hungry and feeling that dildo inside her. She had already grown to hate
it, but now she loathed it.

&nbsp;

She sat slowly going through the night and
the day in her mind, still amazed at herself that she had not been caught. That
motorcyclist would not, she told herself, have been nice, he would surely have
taken advantage of her, maybe even done worse than have sex, maybe even kill
her.

&nbsp;

Her whole body shook at this thought. It
was something she would have to consider next time.

&nbsp;

�next time?� she
suddenly screamed in her mind. How could she be considering doing this
again&gt; she hadn�t even got home from this one yet, and she was already
trying to figure how to make the next time better. Had she lost her mind?

&nbsp;

At last, the light started to fade, but
Sylvie gave it another half an hour to be on the safe side. The first twenty
miles should be okay, as it was countryside, and by the time she reached
civilisation, it should be dark enough for her to escape detection. 

&nbsp;

It took Sylvie over two hours to drive the
thirty miles home, pulling off at quiet junctions here and there to make sure
no-one was following her. Paranoia was getting the best of her.

&nbsp;

Stopping the car in her driveway, Sylvie
looked all around to make sure no neighbours would see her getting out of the
car, and hobbling naked to her door. It took several minutes for her to decide
it was safe enough, and then as fast as she could, she sorted out the house key
in her hand, opened the car door, and kangaroo jumped the last few steps,
opening the lock as fast as she could, and almost falling through the doorway.

&nbsp;

An hour later, sat in her bath, studying
the abrasions caused by the cuffs, and looking at the dildo, now sat on the floor
of the bathroom, Sylvie broke into tears. 

&nbsp;

Next time she would not use a dildo, she
promised herself. She knew, even then, that this trip had really only sharpened
her thirst for more adventures, if only she could have shared it with
someone��������
