Chapter 1


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I understand that this is important to you.&nbsp; I don't understand what you are trying to say."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You know," I said.&nbsp; "It doesn't matter.&nbsp; I really don't want to talk about it anymore.&nbsp; I really don't.&nbsp; I'm just feeling...blah...and I'm complaining.&nbsp; I actually feel better just rambling about it.&nbsp; I think I'll go for a hot bath.&nbsp; I'll talk to you later.&nbsp; I love you."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I love you, too.&nbsp; Feel better."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Thanks."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had to end that conversation.&nbsp; I hated my own 'woe is me' liturgy before I began it.&nbsp; I couldn't bear that I was suddenly in the uber-cute situation of my mother not understanding my description of feeling misunderstood.&nbsp; It's ironic, in a Care Bear, Rainbow Bright sort of way.&nbsp; It's also pathetic, in a pre-teen who wears an ankh and black lipstick sort of way.&nbsp; Nothing about that conversation needed to continue.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I exercised, alternating speed rope and weights, showered, spent an hour looking at online pornography then I masturbated on the toilet with my electric toothbrush.&nbsp; There was a message on my machine from Dauphine.&nbsp; It made me happy, why I had missed her call.&nbsp; It made me sad that I had nobody I could tell that to.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dauphine is nauseatingly pretentious.&nbsp; But she's clever and has a wealth of interesting friends.&nbsp; And she pursues me.&nbsp; This is important.&nbsp; See, I hide.&nbsp; It's what I do.&nbsp; So, unlike most people who choose their friends based on qualities they enjoy and admire, my friends are a radom assortment of weirdos who are willing to hunt me down and drag me into society, kicking and screaming.&nbsp; And all of them baffle me endlessly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So, you see, when I whined to my mother that nobody gets me, it isn't that I feel I'm complex to the point of being opaque.&nbsp; I know there are people in this world with whom I could identify, who would identify with me.&nbsp; I'm just not capable of slotting myself into their lives.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dauphine is a particularly dogged weirdo.&nbsp; I can't imagine her ever wanting to wear the ankh and black lipstick but she would never have had to.&nbsp; She is genetically Gothic.&nbsp; White skin, black hair, famished frame.&nbsp; Whenever she meets a new person, she liltingly offers her hand, palm down, and sighs, "Dauphine."&nbsp; She does it like she's bored to tears with her name.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Trust me, she isn't.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her message was, "Pepper, I know you're home.&nbsp; I've just driven by your place and I've seen your car.&nbsp; Meet me at Drag at seven or incur my wrath."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, she always talks like that.&nbsp; Like she's a character in one of those lipstick and high fashion pulp novels.&nbsp; I keep expecting her to use the word 'Dahling' but she never does.&nbsp; If I ever write about her using that word, that will be a lie on my part.&nbsp; I will try not to but I may do it unintentionally.&nbsp; I have unfairly married her and the word 'Dahling' in my mind and divorce is unlikely.&nbsp; I hear that Carl Sagan never actually used the term, "Billions and billions."&nbsp; It just fit him so perfectly we're all convinced he said it regularly.&nbsp; It's like that.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of course, I went to the restaurant at seven.&nbsp; I like Drago.&nbsp; There is a poster on an easel outside of it with a picture of the chef/owner.&nbsp; She looks like one of those down to earth, unassumingly mannish lesbians.&nbsp; That is a lot of information to get from a picture, sure, but I don't care if I'm wrong.&nbsp; Also, the food is really accessible.&nbsp; There's never anything on the menu that I don't understand.&nbsp; I enjoy trying new things on occasion but mostly I'm just hungry and I want something predictably good.&nbsp; Clever fusions have their place and that place is not ubiquity.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I walked into the restaurant, I looked at the hostess and pointed into the dining area to indicate I was meeting somebody.&nbsp; She said, "Go ahead," as I passed her.&nbsp; I noticed a man looking at my body and he caught me seeing this.&nbsp; I gave him a smile meant to convey that I appreciated the attention which is quite flattering but hoped he wouldn't hit on me because I wasn't really in the right frame of mind to be entertaining offers.&nbsp; I probably just looked sheepish.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dauphine was drinking some yellow martini with a green cocktail onion in it.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That is such a cute dress," she said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I searched her outfit for something to compliment.&nbsp; "Thanks.&nbsp; I like those earrings."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We are women.&nbsp; This is how we shake hands.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I ordered a gin and tonic.&nbsp; Dauphine calls it my signature drink which always makes me want to switch to beer.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"So, Franklin called me this morning.&nbsp; He was beside himself that I had kissed another man at the club last night.&nbsp; Oh, I kissed another man at a club last night.&nbsp; In front of Franklin.&nbsp; That's important to know for this particular story."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Why did you do that?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Franklin and I are not exclusive.&nbsp; He's never even brought up the possibility of marriage."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You kissed the man to make Franklin jealous?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No.&nbsp; I am simply saying that I did nothing wrong, technically."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"So, why did you do it?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh, you know me.&nbsp; I was pretty drunk, too."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wanted to say, "I don't know you.&nbsp; I have no idea who the hell you are.&nbsp; Do you even know you?"&nbsp; But I didn't.&nbsp; I asked, "Did you talk to this guy first or did you just grab a random stranger and..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Of course we spoke.&nbsp; He was cute and charming.&nbsp; And ingratiating.&nbsp; Quite kissable, really."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It's exhausting to be with a constant performer.&nbsp; "Okay, fine.&nbsp; What happened with Franklin."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You know, that guy would be perfect for you, come to think of it."&nbsp; She knows he's attracted to her.&nbsp; That's what makes him perfect for me.&nbsp; I could imagine the constant pulse-taking, You aren't insecure about me having kissed your boyfriend, are you? or Do you ever feel odd that you met your boyfriend because he hit on me?&nbsp; It only now occurred to me that it's almost as though I'm giving you my overflow.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I distracted her by giving her what she wanted.&nbsp; "Come now, don't leave me hanging.&nbsp; I'm dying to know.&nbsp; What did Franklin say?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh.&nbsp; Well, there were some fairly hysterical histrionics.&nbsp; He actually called me a whore."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Mmm."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I told him what I just told you.&nbsp; We're not exclusive.&nbsp; We've never discussed marriage.&nbsp; He has no right to expect me to put all my eggs in one rickety little basket with commitment issues."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'd have commitment issues if my girlfriend kissed another guy."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh, rest it.&nbsp; He was this way before this little event."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Why, though?&nbsp; Why do you think that?&nbsp; I mean, I've never had this 'exclusivity talk' people go on about.&nbsp; I always just assume it.&nbsp; It seems like the sort of thing you take for granted after a certain amount of time."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh, no.&nbsp; You should never simply assume such a thing.&nbsp; You put yourself at great risk of heartache."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No, that's not...what I'm saying is that maybe he assumed the two of you were exclusive.&nbsp; It sounds like he did."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, that was his mistake.&nbsp; I fail to see how that is my fault."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I felt ridiculous that I was going to have to explain this to her.&nbsp; It was like when I was helping an elderly coworker with her computer and realized I had to explain to her that different internet browsers all accessed the same internet.&nbsp; If she didn't know this by now, telling her most likely wouldn't improve the situation.&nbsp; But, I said it anyway.&nbsp; "I don't think it matters whose fault it is.&nbsp; See, it's just a problem that needs a solution, right?&nbsp; He thought you were exclusive and you didn't.&nbsp; The two of you just need to clear that up.&nbsp; Tell him what you want.&nbsp; If you want to be exclusive, tell him that.&nbsp; If you don't want to be exclusive, tell him that.&nbsp; Then he will know what his situation is and you won't have another misunderstanding."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She rolled her eyes and sipped her drink.&nbsp; I realized at that moment that she liked me as little as I liked her.&nbsp; Our common thread, what kept us together, was our willingness to endure each other.&nbsp; Or was that all it was?&nbsp; It didn't seem like it.&nbsp; No, she definitely gave me something I hungered for.&nbsp; For the life of me, I couldn't grasp what it was.&nbsp; I thought it might be that it made me feel better about myself to be next to such a despicable person.&nbsp; That wasn't the answer.&nbsp; It came too easy to explain it that way.&nbsp; It was self deprecating enough to convince myself I wasn't hiding any ugly truths from myself.&nbsp; It worked very well as an explanation but for one little thing.&nbsp; I knew it wasn't true.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She said, "Well, we aren't on speaking terms at the moment so I don't see that conversation, or any other for that matter, happening."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What was the very last thing he said to you?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The waiter came and took our order.&nbsp; When he had left she said, "Fuck you," and took a prissy sip of her drink.&nbsp; "That was the last thing he said.&nbsp; Then he hung up."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"This happened today?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She wasn't wearing a bra.&nbsp; Women with small breasts don't know how envious that makes us buxom women.&nbsp; No bra and a loose blouse that looked capable of accidentally flashing a nipple.&nbsp; I suddenly saw my whole night unfold ahead of me.&nbsp; As loathe as I was to go along with it, it was something to do.&nbsp; It was an activity that would, if nothing else, fill time.&nbsp; "I guess you know where he is going to be tonight."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She smiled a wicked little smile, a smile of shared secrets and deep mutual understanding.&nbsp; "You know me so well."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And, with that, the subject was dropped.&nbsp; We talked about our jobs, our days, people we knew.&nbsp; Then we left and headed to the club where Franklin would be.&nbsp; Franklin is an average looking guy but for his great height.&nbsp; He towers over Dauphine.&nbsp; I often wonder if she calls him 'Daddy' in bed.&nbsp; Most likely, the attraction isn't sexual, she just likes the status symbol aspect of being with a man twice her height.&nbsp; Like most very tall men, he is noticeably not overbearing.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dauphine seemed at ease in the club, I was very uncomfortable.&nbsp; I felt a pang of pity for Franklin which quickly subsided.&nbsp; He was an informed participant.&nbsp; I can say a lot of bad things about Dauphine but the word 'duplicitous' won't be found in them.&nbsp; She lets you know who she is.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She flirted with many, random guys.&nbsp; She danced erotically with many, random guys.&nbsp; Franklin talked with his friends, pretending not to see.&nbsp; I sat at the bar, drinking and being embarrassed for us all.&nbsp; Franklin ultimately approached her on the dance floor.&nbsp; I hoped something huge and dramatic would happen to somehow justify this ridiculous exercise.&nbsp; A fist fight or a marriage proposal.&nbsp; Good or bad didn't matter, just make it big.&nbsp; But it was a useless, fizzle of a resolution.&nbsp; They spoke, Dauphine came and apologized to me because she had to go home with Franklin and talk, leaving me alone.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I said it was fine, not bothering to mention that she'd left me alone at the club all night thus far.&nbsp; I stayed and drank, wishing I'd brought a book but thinking I would look pretty silly reading a book at a dance club.&nbsp; I felt a tap on my shoulder.&nbsp; It was my boss, Roman.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hey," he said.&nbsp; "It's funny seeing you here.&nbsp; It feels so out of context."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I felt nervous, like I'd been caught doing something wrong.&nbsp; "I know.&nbsp; How are you?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Good.&nbsp; Good."&nbsp; He was doing that thing everybody does in clubs, where you shout but try to make it seem like you are talking normally.&nbsp; "You look good.&nbsp; I've never seen you dressed up for the town.&nbsp; It suits you."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Thanks."&nbsp; That really did settle well with me.&nbsp; Roman was the kind of guy you could imagine getting any woman he wanted.&nbsp; He was a serious guy, a decent guy, but he looked dangerous.&nbsp; He looked like he could be a drug dealer or a rock star, he had that scruffy, neglect of grooming look you see in total losers and extremely dedicated people.&nbsp; He had hair down to his mid back, which only flies since we're in the computer industry.&nbsp; "You don't look so bad, yourself," I said, feeling like a complete nerd for the effort.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You here alone?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes.&nbsp; I came with my friend but she had to leave," putting a lot of effort into seeming unconcerned.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He perked up.&nbsp; "Yeah?&nbsp; You need a ride?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm walking distance."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It's kind of dangerous.&nbsp; Want me to walk you home?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I felt like I was at my first boy-girl dance, the first time a boy asked me to dance.&nbsp; I was nervous and excited and suspicious that the whole thing was some cruel dare.&nbsp; Go ask the fat girl to dance, or do you want 'truth' instead?&nbsp; I wasn't fat anymore but I still felt like I was.&nbsp; I felt like I had a fat girl's personality, too receptive to male attention.&nbsp; Like this moment right here:&nbsp; "Sure!" I said with a big smile.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As we walked to my place, I could almost feel the heat coming off of his body.&nbsp; I was probably imagining it but it made me want to touch him, all the same.&nbsp; I wanted to grab his hand and hold it.&nbsp; I wanted to kiss him when we got to my place.&nbsp; I looked at him expectantly, trying to give him a look that conveyed invitation.&nbsp; I probably just looked drunk.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Listen, Pepper..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I lifted my brow, thinking, this is going to happen, I can't believe this is going to happen.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"...hmmm.&nbsp; No, never mind.&nbsp; I'll see you on Monday."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I spent the next half hour looking at more internet porn and masturbating.&nbsp; I fell asleep watching television.&nbsp; I guess Roman was deciding to look into my internet activity at work.&nbsp; Or maybe he already had at this point.&nbsp; He didn't bring it up until Friday, after avoiding me all week.











Chapter 2


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It has brought it to my attention that you have been using a good bit of company time to look at online pornography."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My face collected all the blood from my body and pulsed.&nbsp; I knew how hard I was blushing and that just made the situation all the more humiliating.&nbsp; There was no way out of this.&nbsp; I couldn't hide it.&nbsp; They already knew.&nbsp; My only hope was to be as candid as possible. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes.&nbsp; I have.&nbsp; It has become a bit of an obsession lately and I let it get out of control.&nbsp; If you would give me another chance, I promise I won't do it anymore.&nbsp; And I know you are monitoring it and that's fine but I think I am a valuable asset to this company and it would be a shame to dissolve this relationship over what is essentially a brief lapse in judgment."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I took a deep breath and steeled myself, hoping what I had just said made some sense.&nbsp; My boss just stared at me, icy and focused.&nbsp; His face was a struggle between boyhood and manhood.&nbsp; His eyes were blue, dear, tender. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Don't think this was too unpleasant for me.&nbsp; Roman is insanely hot.&nbsp; His nose is long, with a bump on the bridge that tells the story of a past break.&nbsp; His lips are full and pouty above a strong chin.&nbsp; Black hair.&nbsp; Thick black eyebrows.&nbsp; I look at him and thought, Sicilian blood, which really just makes him hotter.&nbsp; His face is long and thin, while mine is more round.&nbsp; My eyes are large and my nose is small.&nbsp; I think I have more neoteny.&nbsp; I guess this is the sort of irrelevant stuff you think about when you're about to be fired for something you'll never live down.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It's not quite that simple and I have been thinking for a while about how to broach this with you.&nbsp; I can't think of a tactful way to do it.&nbsp; Can I ask you a few personal questions?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wanted to say that he couldn't.&nbsp; When somebody has already seen the kinky, weirdo sex pictures you look at, you don't even want to know what personal question they want answered.&nbsp; "Certainly."&nbsp; The hole I was in, it really couldn't get much deeper.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"How long have you been looking at this stuff?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I tried to think of the best possible answer to this but it was impossible.&nbsp; To say I had only just started would sound like a lie even if it were true which it wasn't.&nbsp; The best for me would be if he thought I was being candid.&nbsp; The best way to make him think that would be to actually be candid.&nbsp; "I guess it's been a couple of years.&nbsp; But I have read a lot of books, stories, stuff like that, since high school, like, fifteen years.&nbsp; It may seem odd but it's just fantasies, really.&nbsp; You can't hold anybody truly accountable for what they fantasize about, right?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"So you've never actually done it?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Have you ever considered trying it?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His stare suddenly seemed more insistent, more meaningful.&nbsp; Like, when somebody is desperately trying to make you figure something out without telling you.&nbsp; I usually have no idea what they want me to suddenly understand but this one wasn't so enigmatic.&nbsp; However, without clarity, there is a lot of uncertainty.&nbsp; I questioned my conclusion pretty thoroughly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I looked down at my hands in my lap.&nbsp; Was he about to make me an offer?&nbsp; This was a tricky bit of land, right here.&nbsp; I couldn't imagine him asking that for any other reason than to offer this thing to me.&nbsp; Was that right or was I seeing it that way because I so wanted to.&nbsp; I felt my lower stomach warm a bit at the prospect.&nbsp; I forced myself to utter two words I'd never spoken together, just to open this road if he wanted to travel it.&nbsp; "No, sir."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I looked up and he had a sly grin on his face, which I matched.&nbsp; My chest was swelling with glee and hope and anticipation, all warm and tingly.&nbsp; "You understand this is a very delicate situation we are in right now."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, what else could that possibly mean?&nbsp; The ball was in my court.&nbsp; That had to be it.&nbsp; He really had everything to lose, here.&nbsp; I was already in a bad position with my job.&nbsp; I could easily lure him into doing something inappropriate then cry sexual harassment to save myself.&nbsp; I undid the top button of my blouse.&nbsp; He said, "I'll need...far...more...than that."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was the moment I was convinced that we were negotiating this thing.&nbsp; I felt a maddening pressure in my groin.&nbsp; I stood up.&nbsp; I slowly unbuttoned my blouse and let it slide down to the floor.&nbsp; I reached behind my back and unclasped my bra.&nbsp; I squeezed my shoulders together and let it slide to the floor.&nbsp; I turned around and pushed my skirt and panties to the floor together.&nbsp; Stepping out from them, I turned around and put my hands on my head.&nbsp; I did it without allowing myself a thought.&nbsp; One errant thought and I would run out of the office, possibly half naked, which would be harder to explain than the porn.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I could feel myself trembling as he stared at me.&nbsp; How long?&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; Somewhere between fifteen minutes and eternity.&nbsp; I stood naked, in heels.&nbsp; I had stripped naked in my boss' office without being asked to.&nbsp; And he wasn't responding at all.&nbsp; I wish I could say I stayed there from force of will but that wasn't it.&nbsp; The pressure in me was building and I didn't want it to go away.&nbsp; The phone rang and I startled at it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He answered it and had a long conversation with somebody about some proposal somebody had written, the merits of it and the issues he had with it.&nbsp; He never took his eyes off of me, though.&nbsp; At one point, staring at me, he said, "I know.&nbsp; I'm looking at it right now."&nbsp; That moment, I felt giddy.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After he hung up, he said, "How do I know you really want this?&nbsp; How do I know you aren't just trying to save your job?"&nbsp; He didn't say it like a question.&nbsp; He said it like a dare.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I swallowed hard, shivering, suffering and happy.&nbsp; "Because I am..."&nbsp; It was harder to say than I thought it would be.&nbsp; "...very, very wet."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Is your clitoris engorged?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I think so."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well.&nbsp; Make sure."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I felt myself.&nbsp; "Yes."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Describe it."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It's hard, like a little bone."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He stood slowly.&nbsp; Walked to me even more slowly.&nbsp; I'm pretty tall but his lean body outstretched me even in my heels.&nbsp; He ran one finger over up my vagina, over my clitoris and my body convulsed.&nbsp; "Good.&nbsp;&nbsp; You didn't lie."&nbsp; He leaned his face close to mine and whispered, "Liars are punished."&nbsp; He sat back on his desk and looked me up and down, like a piece of meat.&nbsp; I felt raw.&nbsp; "You won't lose your job.&nbsp; However this goes, you keep your job.&nbsp; Do you understand?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Excuse me?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, sir."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Better.&nbsp; I've been looking for a new slave.&nbsp; I want a fresh slave.&nbsp; Untrained.&nbsp; I would enjoy training you.&nbsp; Keeping you.&nbsp; You have nice, large tits and a good line to your waist.&nbsp; You have a well toned ass, too.&nbsp; I could get a lot of use out of you.&nbsp; If you are not willing, dress and get back to work.&nbsp; No more porn.&nbsp; We won't speak of this again.&nbsp; Or, sit down and lift your knees to your shoulders so I can inspect my new pussy."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I sat down carefully.&nbsp; I felt so bashful, so naked.&nbsp; I had the sensation that there was a heavy weight sitting in my pelvis.&nbsp; For the first time in my life, I felt aroused throughout my entire body, mind and consciousness.&nbsp; It made me a bit sleepy, like when some constant, nagging anxiety is suddenly alleviated.&nbsp; He was still completely dressed and I wanted some tender words first, something to calm my heart.&nbsp; I lifted my knees to my shoulder blades, my feet touching each other in front of my vagina.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I really don't want to have to punish you already.&nbsp; It's very soon to be punishing you.&nbsp; You want me to tie you up and flog you, already?&nbsp; Do you need a good beating to start you off."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No, Sir!"&nbsp; Terrified, I spread my knees as far apart as I could and stuck my feet up in the air.&nbsp; He kneeled in front of my spread crotch.&nbsp; I felt my own juices trickle down over my anus which he placed the tip of his finger on.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Has this ever been used?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No, Sir."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He slowly pressed his finger inside.&nbsp; It felt almost obscene to feel this pleasure with another person involved.&nbsp; I had only ever felt this alone, while defecating.&nbsp; It was the most private pleasure I'd ever known and he was violating that sanctity.&nbsp; "All holes will be made available to me.&nbsp; You have given yourself to me.&nbsp; My gift in return will be to stretch this hole out enough that it doesn't hurt you when I use it.&nbsp; Do you want me to take my finger out?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, Sir."&nbsp; I don't know why I lied but it ended up being the right decision.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Then it stays in."&nbsp; He spread my labia apart and stared at my vagina.&nbsp; This position I was in made my stomach look fatter than it was.&nbsp; What fat was on it was all pushed together.&nbsp; It was incredibly unflattering.&nbsp; I wanted to be in a position where I was pretty.&nbsp; "You are very wet.&nbsp; You must want an orgasm very badly."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, Sir."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That was not a question.&nbsp; You're going to take a second finger for speaking out of turn."&nbsp; He pushed the finger that was in my anus up and squeezed another finger inside me.&nbsp; The pleasure was gone from it, it just felt like great pressure.&nbsp; "You must learn to relax these muscles."&nbsp; I tried releasing them and it did feel better but he responded to this by pushing his fingers further in.&nbsp; I made a little noise.&nbsp; "Control yourself.&nbsp; Do you have to pee?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No, Sir."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Can you go the rest of the day without using the bathroom?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, Sir."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Good.&nbsp; You'll come to my house after work.&nbsp; But you are not to masturbate until them.&nbsp; To make sure you don't touch my little cooch, here, I'm putting you in a chastity belt."&nbsp; He stuck one finger inside my vagina and wiggled it around.&nbsp; I breathed sporadically, heavy, partly from the pleasure of it but mostly trying to entice him not to stop.&nbsp; "This does not belong to you anymore.&nbsp; It belongs to me, now.&nbsp; As does this."&nbsp; And he wiggled the fingers in my anus.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He pulled the fingers out, went to his desk and brought me the chastity belt.&nbsp; He handed it to me and told me to put it on.&nbsp; It was leather and it took me a few minutes to figure it out.&nbsp; It was like a thong but thick leather.&nbsp; There was a tong for the waist and one at the front and back, securing the strap that ran between my legs.&nbsp; The holes in the straps secured onto these tongs which were really small metal loops.&nbsp; I put it on, tightening it snug.&nbsp; When I was done, he tightened it to one more hole, saying, "I don't want you to be able to get a single, greedy little finger in there."&nbsp; He locked it in place with little luggage locks.&nbsp; "On your knees."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I lowered to my knees, moving awkwardly from the restricting feel of the belt.&nbsp; He took out his penis and told me to kiss it and thank him.&nbsp; I was pleased...no...relieved to see how hard it was.&nbsp; The skin on the head was stretched to a shiny gleam.&nbsp; A small drop of pre-cum was oozing out of the tip.&nbsp; I kissed it off, pulling my head back slightly so he could see the thread of it (it was something I had read in a book), then I kissed the tip again, cleaning off the remainder.&nbsp; "Thank you, Sir.&nbsp; Thank you."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had a smile, almost tender but still somehow sinister on his face.&nbsp; I didn't know how I could endure the rest of the work day, waiting to be alone with him.&nbsp; It seemed so sudden, so out of nowhere, this sexual deus ex machina.&nbsp; I had waited fifteen years, never having the nerve to ask for it, thinking that meant I would never get it.&nbsp; I wanted to cry with relief.&nbsp; More than that, I wanted to masturbate.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Back at my desk, I received a long form attached to an e-mail that read, simply, "Fill this out, slave."&nbsp; The sender email was peppersowner@rosman.com.&nbsp; The form listed all manner of sexual acts.&nbsp; At the top was the instruction to write how I felt about each one being done to me.&nbsp; Excited, interested, not interested, reluctant, completely unwilling.&nbsp; Those were the options.&nbsp; Elaborate where appropriate.&nbsp; I filled it out in an hour and sent it back.&nbsp; It made me so hot to write about these things that I was grinding my groin in my chair.&nbsp; The belt was punishing, it was secured on so flush to my vagina that no movement would make it rub on me.&nbsp; I rubbed my breast but that just made my predicament worse.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;About twenty minutes after sending the form, I got a reply.&nbsp; It read, "If you had any plans for this weekend, use this time to cancel them.&nbsp; You will come to my house directly after work and stay the weekend.&nbsp; You won't need to go home and pack anything.&nbsp; I will be leaving work, now.&nbsp; As I'm leaving, you will thank me, again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Loudly so that everybody hears."&nbsp; Below that were directions to his house.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He came out of his office about ten minutes later.&nbsp; Casually saying, "I'm taking off early, guys.&nbsp; See you on Monday."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Heart racing, almost dizzy, I almost let him get away before shouting, "Mr. Wilson!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He turned and looked at me, slightly quizzically.&nbsp; "Yes?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you so much."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He looked at me harshly.&nbsp; "Okay." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was all I could do not to race to his house at the end of the day.&nbsp; I was afraid of looking too anxious.&nbsp; But I was also afraid of not looking anxious enough.&nbsp; And, when it came down to it, I was just exquisitely anxious.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He lived in suburbia.&nbsp; Free standing mail boxes and bikes in driveways.&nbsp; His house number was spray painted on his curb with a stencil.&nbsp; The curtains on the other side of the window were lacey.&nbsp; I feared another woman held position in his life.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I knocked on his door, he opened it and waved me in.&nbsp; I walked into his den with him.&nbsp; I stopped in the middle of his den when he stopped.&nbsp; He ran his hand over my buttocks and breast.&nbsp; Then he snapped the fingers of his right hand, pointed at me and barked, "Naked!" as he walked away.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I stripped quickly.&nbsp; I couldn't take off the chastity belt as it was locked on.&nbsp; I looked around the room and saw the keys sitting on the coffee table.&nbsp; Terrified I was doing the wrong thing, I removed the locks and the belt.&nbsp; Naked, trembling, I felt a small trickle run down my inner thigh.&nbsp; I placed the belt, locks and keys back on the table.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He returned with some papers.&nbsp; He lay them face up on the table and I could see it was the form I had filled out earlier.&nbsp; He positioned me with my back to the couch, bending over with my arms stretched out, hands splayed on the coffee table, legs spread wide.&nbsp; He sat on the couch right behind me.&nbsp; Looking through my legs, I saw him reading the form.&nbsp; He chuckled a few times.&nbsp; Once he laughed and said, "Yes, that is what 'golden shower' means.&nbsp; I'm not into that, either."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When he was done, he threw the papers to the side and leaned forward, spreading my cheeks apart, speaking directly into my nethers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, here's the situation.&nbsp; Your hard limits will always be respected.&nbsp; Your soft limits, where you put 'reluctant', these will be tested, usually as punishment.&nbsp; Put your fingers inside yourself."&nbsp; I inserted two fingers into my vagina.&nbsp; I pushed them in and out.&nbsp; A small moan escaped me.&nbsp; My knees buckled for a second and I recovered.&nbsp; "Repeat after me.&nbsp; This pussy belongs to Master Everett."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"This pussy belongs to Master Everett."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Now stick that finger in your ass and say, 'This virgin asshole belongs to Master Everett."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"This virgin asshole belongs to Master Everett."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Good.&nbsp; Keep in in there.&nbsp; Move it around."&nbsp; I could hear him undo his pants and a wave of desire shocked my whole frame.&nbsp; I looked through my legs and saw him playing with himself.&nbsp; "Put your thumb in your pussy.&nbsp; No, keep your finger in your ass and put your thumb in your pussy.&nbsp; Like you're picking up a six pack of beer.&nbsp; That's right.&nbsp; Now, how badly do you want to come?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I feel like I'll explode if I don't."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I feel that way, myself.&nbsp; Get on your knees and face me.&nbsp; Spread your knees wide.&nbsp; Fuck my cock with your tits."&nbsp; He held the base of his penis so it stuck up in the air.&nbsp; I grabbed my breasts, each in one hand and pushed them together on either side of his penis.&nbsp; I moved my body up and down.&nbsp; "It's a little dry.&nbsp; Wet it.&nbsp; Get my cock nice and wet," I gathered saliva in my mouth and took his penis in it, trying to salivate.&nbsp; He grabbed the back of my head and thrust it down until I gagged and my mouth filled with spit and ran down his penis, "That's better.&nbsp; Try again."&nbsp; I pushed my breasts back on his penis, heaving my body up and down.&nbsp; My vagina felt so heavy it might drop off my body.&nbsp; He licked his forefingers and thumbs and began tweaking my nipples.&nbsp; I started moaning, trying to beg him wordlessly.&nbsp; He only tweaked harder.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Please."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What do you want, slave?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Please, I want to come."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"How bad?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm going crazy.&nbsp; It's too much.&nbsp; I'll do anything.&nbsp; Please, I want to come."&nbsp; He suddenly had a shocked look on his face, wide mouth and warm, wet come shot out of him, onto my face and then poured onto my breasts.&nbsp; He let out a long sigh and lay back, tweaking my nipples as I continued to plead with my moans.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After long, torturing pause, he said, "You'll have to learn to control that pussy of mine.&nbsp; Lay back on the table.&nbsp; Legs wide.&nbsp; I always want your legs spread in my presence."&nbsp; His two fingers pushed into my anus, again.&nbsp; They worked around and around.&nbsp; He started tickling my clitoris and my whole body shivered and pulsed.&nbsp; I started grinding my pelvis against his finger.&nbsp; "Don't move.&nbsp; Control yourself."&nbsp; He stuck his thumb in my vagina and pulled my pelvis down.&nbsp; I heard myself wail without meaning to.&nbsp; He tickled my clitorus and I struggled to stay still.&nbsp; "Yeah, you keep my pussy right there.&nbsp; Don't you dare move it."&nbsp; Waves of intense pleasure surged through my body.&nbsp; Not able to move in response, I began yelling, wailing until the surge built to an unbelievable pressure that silenced me as every muscle in my body wrenched.&nbsp; Then I came, screaming at the top of my lungs, my whole body convulsing with release.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had me clean up in the bathroom and return to him on the couch, laying with my back across his lap.&nbsp; He played with my breasts.&nbsp; "How did you like that?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That was amazing."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Spread your legs.&nbsp; Are you having any second thoughts?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I put one foot on the back of the couch and one leg on the table.&nbsp; "No.&nbsp; Not at all."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He ran his hand up and down the side of my body.&nbsp; I could feel his warmth through his clothes, smell the musk of him.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He felt my vagina.&nbsp; "You dried it like I told you to?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, Sir."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You're wet again."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, Sir."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He smacked my vagina a few times and I stifled a shriek.&nbsp; "Whose pussy is this?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That is your pussy, Sir," I felt more comfortable with this, now.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Right.&nbsp; I want to be sure you keep your hands off of my pussy.&nbsp; Come with me."&nbsp; He took me to his bedroom and lay me on his bed.&nbsp; He tied me down in an X, ankles and wrists bound to each post.&nbsp; "You need to learn to handle your desire."&nbsp; He took my breast in his hand and tongued my nipple, sucked it, bit it lightly.&nbsp; He did the same with the second nipple, pinching and twisting the first as he did.&nbsp; I moaned and writhed.&nbsp; I wanted him to come inside me.&nbsp; He tickled my clitoris again as I writhed and struggled.&nbsp; "Now, learn to deal with it."&nbsp; And he left, closing the door behind him.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I could hear the television turn on.&nbsp; It flipped through channels and rested on an old boxing match on ESPN.&nbsp; A few rounds in, the telephone rang.&nbsp; The volume on the television lowered and I heard his voice answer.&nbsp; I heard muffled talking for a while.&nbsp; He came into the room with the phone in one hand and a dish rag in the other.&nbsp; He shoved the dish rag in my mouth.&nbsp; All the while he talked on the phone, he played with my nipples and clitoris.&nbsp; He played with my clitoris until I was within striking distance of an orgasm then stopped and focused on my nipples for a while.&nbsp; For a moment, I thought I would climax simply from the sheer, desperate need to.&nbsp; Without looking at me, he walked away as he wrapped up the phone conversation, leaving the cloth in my mouth.&nbsp; The volume went up again and I screamed into the dish rag.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He came back in two hours later.&nbsp; I could tell from how many television shows began and ended.&nbsp; He undressed slowly at the foot of the bed, staring at me.&nbsp; The black hairs on his stomach formed a wine bottle, the neck stretching up between his nipples.&nbsp; There was a little tuft of hair on each broad, bony shoulder.&nbsp; Wordlessly, he climbed onto me, slid into me, worked his hips slightly, thoughtfully.&nbsp; I could hear his breath next to my ear, the breath and hips worked out of sync, forming a polyrythm.&nbsp; Slowly, methodically, he ground his pelvis against me.&nbsp; Each time he moved against me, the pleasure of it invaded my whole body until it had taken over, become something beyond me and out of my control.&nbsp; This time, when I came, I didn't make a sound.&nbsp; I wanted him to stay inside me for much longer but he followed me to climax.&nbsp; I realized he had been waiting for me to go first.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Still not wanting to break the silence, I squeezed my muscles together as though to hug his penis.&nbsp; He withdrew and untied me, folded my up and held me.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He said, "Finally, I'll be able to get some sleep.&nbsp; I won't be up all night thinking about you."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This shocked me, though it shouldn't have.&nbsp; As carefully as he had approached this situation, it was still quite a big risk.&nbsp; Even as willing a participant as I was, this situation was pretty risky for him.&nbsp; It would have to be a secret.&nbsp; I didn't know with certainty but HR must surely frown upon a boss and employee having any sort of sexual liason, much less the kind we were embarking on.&nbsp; I should have known that his desire for me was pretty strong that he would risk so much.&nbsp; But I didn't know that, not until he said this thing to me.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was the one thing he said, "I've been looking for a new slave."&nbsp; It made it seem like who I was didn't matter too much.&nbsp; I realized I shouldn't take what he says to heart when it is in this context.&nbsp; That might require a force of will.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I fell asleep thinking about these things, about him, about what would happen the rest of the weekend.&nbsp; Compared to the pornography I'd been looking at, it was all pretty tame but it excited me and aroused me more than the porn ever had.&nbsp; I remembered reading a man's defense of porn in my brother's girlie magazine, once.&nbsp; He said women shouldn't feel intimidated by it.&nbsp; It's like watching sports.&nbsp; It's fun to watch a man slalom down a 70 degree incline while being chased by bears but it's better to actually put on a pair of skis and coast down a bunny hill.&nbsp; Despite the fact that he was defending porn to a male readership using sports analogies, he was a pretty sharp guy.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It seems like I should tell you that, finally getting what I'd always wanted, I realized it didn't fill the hole inside me.&nbsp; But it did.&nbsp; I found myself making crazy plans for my life.&nbsp; Roman had me worship his flaccid penis with my mouth while he read a magazine.&nbsp; As I did this, I was thinking about starting my own business.&nbsp; He had me clean his place, naked.&nbsp; Dusting the bookshelf, I considered taking up dance again.&nbsp;&nbsp; As he ate, I held his drink between my breasts and wondered how difficult it would be to learn an instrument or a second language.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When I got home on Sunday afternoon, there were several messages on my machine from Dauphine.&nbsp; They got progressively irate.&nbsp; I felt happy and cocky when I called her back.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Where the fuck have you been?&nbsp; I've been calling all weekend."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I spent the weekend with a man."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What about me?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What do you mean?&nbsp; We didn't have plans to do anything."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"We always do something on the weekend."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Not always."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Almost always."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Okay.&nbsp; When we don't it's because you have other plans.&nbsp; This time I did.&nbsp; That's the only difference."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It's not my fault you're always sitting at home."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We were getting off topic.&nbsp; It was time to end the conversation.&nbsp; "Dauphine...we're not...exclusive."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Fuck you."&nbsp; And she hung up on me.&nbsp; It didn't break my mood.&nbsp; I should have been worried but I didn't have it in me.&nbsp; She had never been truly angry with me.&nbsp; It had only been a teasing, openly manipulative pretense at anger.&nbsp; This was the real thing.&nbsp; I would learn what that entailed. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
