 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;High Cleric Ramona Wilhelm pulled open the office door and entered the waiting room.&nbsp; Her knee high white boots clicked on the linoleum floor as she walked to an empty seat.&nbsp; Across from her sat a knave, one which Ramona immediately recognized from one of her recent cases.&nbsp; She had recommended his execution, but her co-arbiters outvoted her and gave the man a mere slap on the wrist.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was the slight but constant injustices like that which had prompted Ramona to quit the Council and entertain her lifelong wishes to be a real adventurer.&nbsp; Though her limited combat skills did little to help defeat rogues and ruffians like the scum across from her, she had what no mercenary could learn&#8212;the Light&#8217;s blessing.&nbsp; The powers from on high which flowed through her veins granted her unimaginable Holy powers, helping her attain the title of High Cleric in record time.&nbsp; At the age of thirty, eight years after attaining the title, she was still the youngest of her rank in the entire world.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ramona waited over an hour, her legs crossed below the knee to obstruct the lecherous glances from the other applicants.&nbsp; She knew that her tall, slender figure and long blond hair would attract the attention of men, but she loathed the looks of lust that always seemed to hone in on her legs, ass, and breasts.&nbsp; Her adventuring clothing didn&#8217;t help, either.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, after all others had been called from the waiting room, a scantily clad mage entered.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ramona Wilhelm?� asked the woman as she glanced down at her clipboard.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, that&#8217;s me,� Ramona answered, trying her best to hide her contempt for the mage&#8217;s profession and needlessly tantalizing attire.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Madame Darksbane is waiting for you.&nbsp; If you&#8217;ll please follow me.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ramona followed the mage down a long hallway towards a black door, covered floor to ceiling with ornate gothic etchings.&nbsp; The employee knocked and said, �Madame, the High Cleric is here for the interview.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you, Celia.&nbsp; Send her in.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Celia grasped the golden door handle, turned it, and swung the door open slowly, betraying the excessive weight of the door.&nbsp; �Good luck,� she wished as Ramona walked past her into the windowless office.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bookshelves lined every inch of wall space.&nbsp; Behind the desk sat the Madame Darksbane, guild leader of the Shadow Nights.&nbsp; She wore a pure black pantsuit, crimson lipstick, and her hair black hair in a professional bun.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ah, Miss Wilhelm!� she said, setting down her fountain pen to stand and greet her guest.&nbsp; �You have no idea how it pleases me to have someone of your stature interested in our little guild.&nbsp; I know that we&#8217;ve had a few� run-ins with the Council over the last few years, but I assure you that we have purged those ruffians from our roster.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ramona knew that the claim was a stretch, having recognized at least three of the previous interviewees as having been defendants in her own court.&nbsp; However, she had no intention of letting nuance interfere with her ambitions.&nbsp; She sat down in the chair and crossed her legs, straightening her knee-length blue dress.&nbsp; �Thank you, Madame Darksbane.&nbsp; My only wish is to help cleanse the undead from our plagued city.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, that is our number one business, but I&#8217;m sure that you&#8217;re aware of that.&nbsp; We keep highly detailed logs filed at city hall, just as your council requires.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ramona smiled and waved her hands dismissively.&nbsp;&nbsp; �No, no, that isn&#8217;t me anymore.&nbsp; No matter how many priestesses and clerics we assigned to the city, the ranks of undead continue to grow.&nbsp; The powers that my position granted me were useless, so I left to pursue a more useful career.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Madame leaned forward on her desk and responded, her voice filled with enthusiasm, �The council&#8217;s loss is our gain, then.&nbsp; You have no idea how happy that makes me, Miss Wilhelm.&nbsp; I assure you, if you join our guild, you can play a truly monumental role in the war against the forces of darkness.� 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Count me in.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you, Miss Wilhelm.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Why don&#8217;t you let me show you around our facilities and let you meet your new coworkers?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ramona gave a courteous nod and followed the Madame into the hallway.&nbsp; Her guide pulled on a golden lamp fixture.&nbsp; Portion of the wall slid back, revealing an unlit hidden hallway.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It&#8217;s always a good idea to keep your facilities well hidden.&nbsp; Follow me closely; it can get confusing in here.�&nbsp; She reached her hand out to Ramona and led her into the darkness.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The duo briskly made their way through the hallways in a quick succession of random and sudden turns.&nbsp; They exited into a small chamber in front of iron double doors.&nbsp; �We&#8217;re here.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That&#8217;s a lot of security,� remarked Ramona, vaguely recognizing the style of architecture but not able to pinpoint its precise origin.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Madame Darksbane pulled the door open.&nbsp; Beyond it laid only darkness.&nbsp; The air was filled with distant and dampened moans.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What&#8217;s in there?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Some of your coworkers.&nbsp; Come on.�&nbsp; The Madame disappeared into the shadows.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ramona naively followed.&nbsp; �What is this place?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without warning, the Madame punched Ramona in the stomach, forcing her to collapse to her knees.&nbsp; From the distance, she could hear the sounds of boots clapping against the stone floor.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oof!� she moaned.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A kick finished the job, knocking High Cleric Ramona Wilhelm on to her back.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�She&#8217;s down,� yelled Madame Darksbane.&nbsp; The lights turned on, revealing the source of the moans.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Inclined beds encircled the perimeter of the circular room, each holding a naked and gagged woman.&nbsp; Black straps crossed their torsos and limbs, binding each of them in place.&nbsp; Their bellies bulged, each to varying degrees, though it took Ramona a few seconds to realize why.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They were pregnant.&nbsp; Strapped in place and perpetually bound, the women were pregnant.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What the hell are you doing to them?� yelled Ramona as she tried lifting herself to her feet.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The men grabbed each of her forearms and dragged her towards one of the empty beds.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ramona glanced from woman to woman and realized the pattern; they were all of the priestesses and clerics that she had assigned to patrol the city against the forces of darkness.&nbsp; �Colette, Rachel, Erica, Yuki, � what are you doing to them?� she yelled.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It should be obvious,� laughed Madame Darksbane.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m breeding an army.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The men lifted Ramona onto the bed.&nbsp; They wrestled her arms and legs to her sides, then strapped and locked them into place, her legs spread painfully far apart and arms across as if on a crucifix.&nbsp; With their victim secured, they left the chamber.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No� no, this can&#8217;t be real.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Madame walked to Ramona&#8217;s bedside and placed her hand on her new prisoner&#8217;s chest.&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t say stupid, clich�d things like that, High Cleric Ramona Wilhelm.&nbsp; I always admired you for being unique among the Council, and being insipid will just make me think less of you.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why would you do this to the women?� asked Ramona, realizing that each and every one of the pregnant women was staring directly at her.&nbsp; �What could you possibly do this for?&nbsp; Why them?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The giant door opposite the entrance opened up, and a swarm of naked men slowly stumbled towards Ramona and Darksbane.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Two birds with one stone, my dear Ramona.�&nbsp; She turned her heads to look at the encroaching horde, then turned back towards Ramona with a wide grin that accentuated her thin lips and heavy makeup. �Every single priestess plucked from the street makes our undead more difficult to purge, but that isn&#8217;t all.�&nbsp; Her voice grew quiet.&nbsp; She continued, �I&#8217;ll let you in on a little secret,� She leaned over and whispered into the High Cleric&#8217;s ear, �The Possessed love raping holy women, for a truly remarkable reason.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The words drove Ramona into a frenzy, confirming her fears.&nbsp; She would be raped and impregnated unless she could escape.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Did you know that children born to holy mothers are innately resistant to the Light&#8217;s powers?&nbsp; That once a demon possesses them, that exorcising the parasite is virtually impossible?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ramona shook violently in her reigns, but did not move, her muscles stretching and flexing in place.&nbsp; She snapped her head forward to head butt Darksbane and yelled., �Get off me you bitch!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She flinched away a moment before contact, Ramona&#8217;s eyelashes bristling against her cheek.&nbsp; �Now now, you&#8217;re in no position to make demands.&nbsp; Look, I think the men are ready.�&nbsp; She turned and nodded towards the first in line.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ramona cringed when she realized the bright red glow inside the men&#8217;s eyes, one of the only external signs of demon possession.&nbsp; Based on the intensity of the contamination, she could tell that these men were irrevocably lost to the demons, their souls hiding in a distant corner of the vessel as their hosts exercised full control of the bodies.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Aren&#8217;t they wonderful?&nbsp; The Possessed make such great parents.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Let me go!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you kidding?&nbsp; You&#8217;re one of the most Blessed women in the world, and you&#8217;re going to make a great mother. No, a fantastic mother.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first man crawled onto the bed between Ramona&#8217;s legs and rolled up her skirt, revealing her baggy white panties.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, please!� she cried, trembles of fear starting to wrack her body.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Madame chuckled.&nbsp; �You think they&#8217;ll listen to you?&nbsp; Sorry, they only do what I or my masters tell them.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No�� she muttered just before the Possessed shoved his cock into her virgin cunt.&nbsp; A horrid scream erupted from her lungs and echoed across the giant chamber.&nbsp; Her fellow slaves winced at the high-pitched shriek.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Madame cackled sadistically, her hands still caressing her prisoner&#8217;s chest and tits. �Excellent!&nbsp; I really am so glad that you decided to join our guild.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ramona&#8217;s speech stopped and jerked as the Possessed thrust in and out of her, �You� evil� bitch!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Heroines are so boring after they&#8217;ve lost.&nbsp; I thought highly of you, but you&#8217;re every bit as dull as the rest of them.&nbsp; That&#8217;s enough out of you.�&nbsp; She reached beneath the bed and pulled out a bit gag.&nbsp; She shoved it into Ramona&#8217;s mouth and fastened it behind her head.&nbsp; �There.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll let the men do their job in peace.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ramona screamed into the gag, but the Madame merely smiled and caressed her chest and tits, pinching Ramona&#8217;s nipples through the loose dress and bra.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tears streamed down Ramona&#8217;s cheeks as her virginity was mercilessly torn away.&nbsp; She had hoped to die innocent, true to her vows as the Light demanded of her, but that dream was dead.&nbsp; Physically weak, there was nothing she could do against the Possessed or the rest of the Madame&#8217;s guild.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The men abused Ramona&#8217;s, their suppressed souls offering no resistance.&nbsp; They had no goal, no dreams and ambitions other than to impregnate the holy women lured into their lair.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Each of the Possessed took a turn dumping their loads into Ramona, until their fluids overflowed from her insides and pooled on the bedspread. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oooh, that was fantastic, wasn&#8217;t it?� mocked Darksbane.&nbsp; �Here, let me make you a bit more comfortable.�&nbsp; She reached beneath the bed and cranked a lever.&nbsp; The bed tilted backwards until Ramona&#8217;s hips were higher her head.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�There, that will help you do your job.&nbsp; Sweet dreams.�&nbsp; She leaned in and kissed Ramona on the cheek before leaving the breeding grounds, knowing that Ramona had a job to do.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her life as a holy woman was over.&nbsp; Now, she would be a mother, and none of her tears would ever be able to change that.&nbsp; No matter how smart she was, no matter how much the Light shone on her, she would never escape.&nbsp; She was in the prime of her life, and there were many children to birth.
