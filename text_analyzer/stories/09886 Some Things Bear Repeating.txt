"Hmm?"
"Bored. You sound bored."
"I�uhh�"
"Bored. Bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored. Oh my god, I'm boring you."

"�"
"�"
"I don't think I know what you mean."
"Yes, you do."
"Wait, what?"
"Wake up the hamsters. Turn the wheel. Do some math."
"�"
"�"
"Are weeee tal�"
"Uh huh."
"�"
"�"
"You've�always�said 'no' to things like that. Firmly."
"Yeah, well, things change."
"I don't think we're talking about the same thing."
"Yes, we are."
"I'm pretty sure I don't know where to begin."
"Well, what do you keep asking for."
"You know that was always in the heat of the moment, and I always respected your 'no's. And I have quit asking."
"Well, we're not there, are we. And I'm not saying 'no'."
"You're saying 'yes'."
"Yes. 'Yes'."
"What if you say 'no' anyway?"
"I'm giving you an override pass. Ignore it. Old habits, you know."
"So let me get this straight. You are telling me that we are going to do that�thing�and if you say 'no' it means 'yes'."
"No, I'm pretty sure I'm going to mean 'no' with every fiber of my being. And I don't suspect I will be easy about it. But you get to ignore it. Busy?"
"What?"
"Right now. What are you doing?"
"Uhh, talking to you."
"I married a fucking genius. So you don't really have anything else to do right now, do you."
"You mean now."
"Yes. Now. Bored, remember?"
"Wait, wait, wait. I need to know something."
"What else do you want? A bid? A summons?"
"Afterwards. What happens afterwards?"
"What's the matter? Don't you trust me? Don't you loovve me?"
"You know what I mean."
"What do I have to do here, sing an Abba song?"
"God, that movie sucked."
"Brosnan, yes. Streep was a nice surprise. Don't change the subject. C'mon. 'Yes'. Look at me. 'Yes'."
"�"
"Come on, now. You're going to ruin it. Tomorrow is another day."
"�Ok."
(loud exhale) "'Bout god damn time."
"Yeah yeah yeah. You hated that movie, hard."
"IIIIII liike it! Better?"
"Boom. With the way you feel about Peter Weller, are you stoking my delicate male ego here?"
"Mmhmm. Annnd�honey?"
"Hmm?"
"God doesn't exist, you're the Easter bunny, Oz is real, and that guy? Not what you think."
"Do you seriously think that as much as we've had to go through for one lousy word that your powers of persuasion are now infinite?"
"Had to try. Just screwing with you. Oh, maybe shouln'tda put it that way. Ha ha."
"Yer still a chuckle and a half."
"Hi-frickin-larious. And I love you."

"You know."
(Yawn) "Ya lost me."
"No I didn't. Leave it alone."
"Isn't it kinda early?"

"What subject? I�uh�oh. Wait."
"Yeeaah: 'No'."
"No?"
"No."
"�"

"Is this one of those 'no's that doesn't really mean no?"
"No. 'No' means 'no'. And don't you ever forget it. Never again."
"Did I ask something?"
"No. And the answer is still 'no'."
"So, let me get this straight. We had us a 'no' that meant 'no', except it meant 'yes' a coupla times, and now it means 'no' again. Right?"
"Yes. 'No'."
"Wait. What?"
"Don't make me say it again."

"I'd rather be bored."
"I see. So, why?"
"Hm?"
"Here we go. 'You heard me'."
"�"
"Why. Why is the 'no' that was 'yes' again a 'no'?"
"I�I didn't like it."
"I beg to differ."
"I didn't like how it made me feel."
"Again with the begging and the differing."
"The next day. I didn't like how it made me feel the next day."
"And how was that?"
"I really don't want to talk about it. I felt�I felt�dirty�"
"Ah. I see. I make you feel dirty. Got it."
"No, not you. Just that�you know."
"That's�not any better, you know."
"Hmm?"
"Because�that�you know, made me believe you finally trusted me. 'Trusting me', makes you feel dirty. Great."
"Wait, where are you going?"
"I'm gonna go pout for a while."
"Why? I'm just telling you what I want and how I feel!"
"Because my wife didn't trust me, then she did, and now she doesn't again."
"No! don't go�oh god. Fuck."
"Mmmm. See? Uhhh. Isn't this nice?"
"Yeah."
"God, that feels good. Hhhh. Hhhh."
"Good."
"Hhhuhhh, hhuhhh, hhhuhhh. Oh, god�"
"�"
"Ooohhhhhhh. Mmmm. Mmm. Mm."
"�"
"What's the matter?"
"Nothing. This is great."
"�"
"�"
"Did you finish?"
"Yeah. Yeah."
"I�I didn't notice."
"You were busy. Really, this was fine."
