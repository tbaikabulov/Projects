CHAPTER 1 
She opened an eye, but her whole world was still one of darkness.
    She felt something around her face, like a mask. It made her grow cold with
    fear as she began to regain consciousness. Ronnie tried to move but couldn't. 
She felt the rope wrapped round and round her body, securing her tightly
    to a narrow couch. Her wrists were tied securely together and then pulled
    behind her head where they were secured to the back of the couch. 
Ronnie became aware she was totally naked. Her legs were drawn under
    the couch and were tied tightly together at her ankles, the couch forcing
    her legs apart. For a brief moment she was terrified at the realisation her
    sex was open and fully exposed. She made to scream but the ball-gag in her
    mouth made any sound virtually impossible. 
Then she became aware of something else. Her vagina was filled with
    something hard. It felt like a big cock was just sitting there inside her,
    filling her up. Ronnie gained consciousness quite rapidly and as she did
    so, the sound of soft humming suddenly made its entry into her world. As
    it did so, the dildo in her vulva began to stroke her rhythmically. The dildo
    was attached to a device that was mounted on the end of the couch, a device
    that thrust the dildo about four inches into and out of her vulva at the
    rate of about two strokes a second. 
The dildo was large in width, just over an inch and a half, and it
    was stretching Ronnie's sex with each thrust, bringing to her senses a strange
    mixture of pain and arousal. 
Then, as her consciousness was restored, the dildo took over her body
    and she began to almost silently moan her way to an orgasm. She knew it was
    only the start of what she had been promised � and she was not looking forward
    to what else was in store for her. She could cope with the dildo for now,
    but knew that it would soon be painful as it continued its relentless fucking
    action inside her vulva. Her sex was becoming more sensitive and more tender
    with each stroke and, even as her second orgasm built to its inevitable climax,
    Ronnie began to feel the pain that this huge device was causing her. 
As the third orgasm mixed with the pain of the intrusive instrument,
    Ronnie remembered why she was here and knew she had no choice. She would
    just have to put up with whatever was going to be demanded of her.

The letter sat on the dining room table, and under it was the envelope
    it had been posted in. Posted, not hand delivered. Posted. The letter had
    been addressed to Craig Carter and, as was usual, he had got to the post
    that morning while his wife, Ronnie, was still getting dressed upstairs. 
Normally the radio would be on in the kitchen as Craig prepared their
    breakfast, but the kettle had long since boiled and switched itself off and,
    having opened the post, Craig had sat waiting. 
�Breakfast ready, darling?� The female voice called downstairs. Silence,
    not the usual reply. Then came the footsteps as Ronnie descended the staircase. 
�What's up?� She asked, poking her head round the dining room door
    and noticing the table was bare. 
�This is,� Craig glowered at her as he held the single sheet of paper
    up for her. 
Ronnie took the sheet and looked at it, turning pale as she did so. 
�Shit!� She said. �What bastard would send something like this?� 
�The bastard you've been fucking, perhaps?� Craig spat the words out. 
�But I haven't been, there's only you,� Ronnie protested. 
�Really.� Craig took the letter and read it out loud. �Dear Craig,
    I thought you'd like to know that your wife is really good in bed. She really
    is one of the best oral givers I know and I love the tattoo on the inside
    of her left leg � how amusing to have a four leaf clover just below her shaven
    sex. I am really jealous that you have at your disposal one of the most prominent
    clitorises I have ever had the pleasure of stroking. Also, I think your wife
    is a really good fuck. I don't want anything other than for you to know how
    much I enjoyed our times together over the past six weeks.� The letter was
    unsigned. Ronnie had gone pale. �So,� Craig spat at her, �tell me nothing
    is going on.� 
�There's nothing going on,� said Ronnie flatly but she hesitated a
    fraction of a second too long. 
�So how does he know all this?� 
�I don't know.� Now she stuttered slightly as Craig's voice got louder. �I
    tell you, there's nothing going on.� 
�Meaning you finished with this guy, whoever he is, and now he's out
    to get his own back.� 
�Meaning I only love you.� 
�Horse shit � this isn't the first time you've slept around either,
    is it?� 
�I haven't been sleeping around.� 
�No. Take a look at these.� Craig tossed a set of photographs on the
    table. �I had you followed about six months ago � you remember, the time
    when you refused to have sex. I guessed something was up then and I proved
    it. Isn't that the guy who used to run the church music group you were in?� Craig
    picked one picture where Ronnie was clearly fucking another guy. She was
    lying on her back on a rug on some grass with her skirt above her waist,
    oblivious to the presence of the photographer even though she was looking
    in the general direction of the camera. Her face showed she was close to
    orgasm. �This letter just proves you're at it again.� 
�No it doesn't and, anyway, how dare you have me followed!� Suddenly
    Ronnie was indignant. 
�I had you followed because I wanted to know what was going on � and
    I've had enough, what with this letter.� 
�I don't know who this is from, honestly, Craig.� 
�Well, he sure knows you, intimately!� Craig was shouting at her now. �Well,
    I've had enough. You can take the day off work, pack your bags and get out.
    I don't care where you go.� 
�You can't kick me out, I haven't done anything. All right, I admit
    I had a very brief, tiny affair about six months ago. I can hardly deny that
    as you have the pictures to prove it, but I honestly haven't seen anybody
    else since.� 
�So, how do you explain the letter?� 
�I cant.� 
�Well, the fact you cheated on me six months ago is enough for me.
    I want you out of here by tonight.� 
�What if I promised to change?� Ronnie now sounded frightened, her
    earlier bravado having failed. Her voice said she was scared. 
�What are you saying?� 
�What if I promised to change. Do you really hate me that much?� 
�Change, how?� 
�Well, what if I promised to do the things for you I've always refused
    to do before?� 
�Okay, keep talking.� 
�Well, would you let me stay?� 
�Only if the change was permanent and not just something to try and
    keep you here.� 
�Okay.� 
�And one other thing. You're going to be punished for your affair.� 
�Punished, how do you mean?� 
�I mean, you will be taught a lesson � a lesson of the kind you will
    never forget. Now, I have to get moving. Think about it and let me know tonight.
    Either you agree or your bags must be packed.� 
�Okay. What time will you be back?� 
�About eight. I have to meet someone after work and that will take
    an hour.� 
Craig got up from the table, kissed Ronnie goodbye and a couple of
    minutes later he was on his way. He drove round the corner and pulled in
    before fishing his mobile phone out of his pocket. 
�Hi, Mr Dawson, it's Craig Carter.� A pause as Dawson  replied. �Yes,
    it went like a dream. A straight confession more or less and I think she'll
    go for the lesson.� Another pause. �Yes, yes, if all is okay then you can
    collect her later on this evening. I will call you later on when she has
    made her decision.� 
Carter put the phone back in his pocket and smiled � revenge was gong
    to be sweet for him and very painful for Ronnie. All she had to do was make
    the right choice! She had been a stalwart church goer � the on hope now was
    she would have absorbed the teachings over the years and now she would want
    to do it � repent! 
*** 
&nbsp;
It was lunchtime when Ronnie heard her mobile phone ringing. 
�Hi, it's me,� said Craig abruptly, �have you made your decision?� 
�Yes, I don't want to leave you and I'm really sorry.� 
�Good, in that case we'll organise your punishment for this evening
    and then we'll see whether you earn the right to stay or not.� 
�What do you want me to do?� 
�Do?� Craig paused for a moment. 
�Yes, what must I do?� Ronnie sounded unsure of herself. 
�Well, first you can have a bath. I want to see you as naked as the
    day you were born. I know you like shaving down there, but you'd better be
    silky smooth when I touch you or I'll wax you with candle wax.� 
�Yes, Craig, anything else?� 
�Sure. Dress sexily. I want you ready well before I get home and you
    had better have a couple of drinks to relax yourself. It's going to be a
    tough evening.� 
�Anything you want, Craig.� Ronnie sounded defeated and knew she would
    have to comply with Craig's wishes or she risked losing everything. 
�And I will want everything, believe me. Things you haven't even begun
    to dream of. Now, I have to get going. Don't know when I'll be back but you
    had better be ready by six.� 
�Okay Craig, but please don't be too hard on me.� 
�I'll be as hard as I want to be. Now, I have to go.� 
The mobile phone went dead, leaving Ronnie wondering just what was
    going to happen to her. It was one o'clock  and
    she had a few hours spare to worry about things. 
�Mr Dawson,� Craig said a few moments later, �it's Craig Carter.� 
�Hello Craig, how's things?� Dawson  had
    been waiting for the call. 
�Good. Ronnie has agreed to the punishment and will be ready by six.� 
�She doesn't know anything about my involvement, does she?� Said Dawson  carefully. 
�Good God know � that would spoil the surprise.� 
�Excellent. Well, you can make your way to the farm. I'll be back
    with her by seven at the latest.� 
�Thank you. I'll wait down the lane until you turn up, then I'll help
    you if you need it.� 
�I won't need any help, but it's kind of you to offer. You realise
    it will take most of the night, don't you?� 
�No problem, Mr Dawson, tomorrow is Saturday.� 
�In that case, I will see you later on. You are sure the keys work,
    aren't you?� 
�Absolutely. I tested them myself last week, just before I gave them
    to you.� 
�That's good, so there should be no last minute hitches. I'll see
    you about seven and we can take things from there.� 
�Thank you,� said Craig. 
�Oh, don't thank me, you're the client don't forget. I just hope it
    works out for you and that my services are worth the money.� 
�They will be and I will enjoy watching what you do, no matter what
    the outcome.� 
�Be assured, the outcome will be everything you expect and more. I
    have never failed yet and I don't intend to with your wife.� 
�That's good to know. I will see you later then.� 
�Yes.� 
The phone went dead. 
*** 
Ronnie had bathed and carefully shaven her sex, under her arms and
    all over her legs by half five. The foaming bubble bath had smelled inviting
    as she'd poured it into the hot water. She washed carefully, knowing Craig
    would be in a mood to pick fault with her. Then she'd selected a fresh razor
    blade and meticulously spent half an hour in the hot water shaving off every
    unwanted hair she could find. 
She'd actually got turned on by the sensation of the blade as it removed
    the short pubic hairs she'd allowed to grow since her last shaving episode.
    That had been for Darren, another of her flings. She was sure he would not
    have written to Craig, if only because their little arrangement was still
    very current indeed. The letter was a mystery indeed. With Darren out of
    the frame the thought occurred to Ronnie that the ex-band leader from the
    church might have decided to instigate revenge on the way they had split
    up � but if so, why wait over six months to do so? 
The mystery was, Ronnie decided, unlikely to be resolved as she lay
    in the bath checking her handiwork and allowing the middle finger of her
    right hand to caress her swollen, sensitive clitoris. 
She climaxed gently under her own ministrations and then decided to
    towel herself dry. She knew she'd be in demand later on so decided not to
    take her arousal further just yet. 
She dressed sexily in a skimpy black, partly see-through blouse, a
    short tartan mini skirt and stockings which were of the self-supporting variety.
    She pulled up her tiny black thong and smiled to herself. She was ready and
    the two glasses of wine she could easily consume in the half hour before
  six o'clock would ensure she was feeling more confident of
    pleasing Craig when he finally came home. 
She had just drained the second glass of wine and was lying back in
    the armchair facing away from the lounge door when she heard the front door
    open. It closed softly as it always did when Craig came home. There were
    sounds in the hallway as he approached the lounge. 
Ronnie waited for him to greet her in his usual manner, afraid to
    call out in case it annoyed him. She had no idea what he wanted for the evening
    but she knew she dare not disappoint so, as he had instructed her, she sat
    in the chair waiting for her instructions. 
She was aware of the presence behind her a moment before she felt
    the hand cover her nose and mouth. The hand held a pad of cloth that had
    been dipped in something. Ronnie tried to struggle but was held securely
    in the chair. She gasped for breath and took in a lungful of something that
    was not oxygen. Struggling in vain to escape from her captor, Ronnie felt
    the room spin for a moment as she slipped into unconsciousness. 
Dawson  wasted no time once Ronnie was out cold.
    He went back out the front door and opened the pull-up garage door. He drove
    his car into the garage and pulled the door down. 
With the door protecting him from any prying eyes, Dawson  went
    to work. The door from the garage to the hallway was already unlocked and
  Dawson had soon half-carried and half-dragged Ronnie from the armchair where
  she had slumped and dumped her onto the back seat of the car. As she lay there,
  Dawson pulled her thong down and off her, tossing it back into the hallway. 
Five minutes later, with Ronnie's wrists and ankles tied together, Dawson
   was on the road heading back to his farm house. Although her limbs were tied
    one to the other, Dawson did this only as a precaution for in reality he
    was as certain as he could be that Ronnie would remain unconscious for the
    whole of the journey and probably for some time after it as well. 
The evening had given way to full night and the darkness was welcomed
    by Dawson  for it made it less likely anyone
    would observe the semi-naked woman bound and slumped on the seat behind him.
    The radio was infuriatingly playing the latest remix of �Is This The Way
    To Amarillo � but Dawson  was
    too preoccupied with his thoughts and the journey to change channels. 
Finally Dawson  turned off the road
    onto the track that led to his farmhouse. He was expecting Craig Carter to
    be lurking in the shadows somewhere but there was no immediate sign of his
    car. Unperturbed by the absence of his client, Dawson set about the task
    of removing Ronnie from the back of his car and hauling her into his dungeon. 
The room was aptly named for it was a place of torture, sexual torture,
    and a growing list of young and not so young women had lived to rue the day
    they had entered the room. A few, a very few, had enjoyed the experience
    and all of them had left wiser and less likely to disobey their partner in
    the future. 
Ronnie was not heavy and soon Dawson had her lying on the narrow,
    black-leather upholstered couch. With ease he removed her self-supporting
    stockings and shoes. Her mini skirt unzipped down one side and was soon lying
    on the floor, to be joined a minute later by her blouse. 
As she lay naked and unconscious on the couch, Dawson  prepared
    her. With a long length of rope he secured her to the couch, tying her to
    it securely. He stretched her arms above her head and secured her wrists
    to a bar just below the mattress. Then he lowered her legs on either side
    of the couch, reaching underneath it to tie her ankles securely together,
    pushing her legs wide apart, exposing her sex. 
She had pouting labia and a hood that barely concealed the very prominent
    bud of her clitoris. Dawson smiled to himself when he saw the short, stray
    pubic hair between her legs. She had been careless and it was going to cost
    her dearly. Craig would ensure that would be the case when he eventually
    arrived. 
Dawson was not keen on latecomers and as he rarely allowed the client
    to witness a torture session, Craig's tardiness was even more infuriating.
    With a tug on the rope round her ankles that was a bit stronger than really
    necessary, Dawson  brought her legs up
    under the couch and secured them to a strut on the underside. 
Next Dawson  went over to his work
    bench and opened a drawer. Pulling out the blindfold he spent a few seconds
    positioning it so he was sure Ronnie would be able to see nothing but blackness
    when she regained consciousness. 
Satisfied the blindfold was correctly positioned, Dawson  pushed
    the ball gag into Ronnie's mouth, securing its fastenings behind her head. 
Finally, Dawson  positioned the
    piston dildo. The head of the dildo was about an inch and a half in diameter
    and the device had a ten inch long shaft of about an inch diameter. Onto
    the base end of the shaft was a long rod which was then fixed to an offset
    wheel on a box which Dawson  had secured
    to the bottom end of the couch. 
Dawson  applied some gel to the tip of the vibrator
    and pushed it against Ronnie's labia. They were already partly open, in a
    pouting sort of fashion and the head of the dildo, though large, slid easily
    into her vulva. Dawson fed four inches into her and then secured the locking
    nut on the piston rod, ensuring the dildo was now held in place. 
Ronnie was prepared and, when she regained consciousness, Dawson  knew
    the dildo would soon bring her to a climax. Most times they had sex, so Craig
    had told him, Ronnie lost interest after her first mini orgasm. She was not
    a climax-seeker, well not with Craig anyway, though he had more than once
    smelled the musk of high arousal when she had returned from supposedly seeing
    a few friends. Tonight though, Ronnie would be taken to a new realm of sexual
    pleasure, and she would be taken there through pain and humiliation. 
Where the hell was Craig? Dawson  thought
    to himself. The show had to start and it had to start soon. Dawson plugged
    the lead coming from a box mounted on the nearby wall into the box end of
    the dildo and then, his work completed for the moment, he retired to his
    lounge. 
Half an hour later there was still no sign of Craig and, on the TV
    screen in front of his armchair, Dawson  saw
    Ronnie start to regain consciousness. She rocked her head from side to side
    as she slowly realised what had happened to her. As she stirred, she opened
    an eye, but her whole world was still one of darkness. She felt something
    around her face, like a mask. It made her grow cold with fear as she began
    to regain consciousness. Ronnie tried to move but couldn't. 
She felt the rope wrapped round and round her body, securing her tightly
    to a narrow couch. Her wrists were tied securely together and then pulled
    behind her head where they were secured to the back of the couch. 
Ronnie became aware she was totally naked. Her legs were drawn under
    the couch and were tied tightly together at her ankles, the couch forcing
    her legs apart. For a brief moment she was terrified at the realisation her
    sex was open and fully exposed. She made to scream but the ball-gag in her
    mouth made any sound virtually impossible. 
Then she became aware of something else. Her vagina was filled with
    something hard. It felt like a big cock was just sitting there inside her,
    filling her up. Ronnie gained consciousness quite rapidly and as she did
    so, the sound of soft humming suddenly made its entry into her world. As
    it did so, the dildo in her vulva began to stroke her rhythmically. The dildo
    was attached to a device that was mounted on the end of the couch, a device
    that thrust the dildo about four inches into and out of her vulva at the
    rate of about two strokes a second. 
The dildo's head was large in width, just over an inch and a half,
    and it was stretching Ronnie's sex with each thrust, bringing to her senses
    a strange mixture of pain and arousal. 
Then, as her consciousness was restored, the dildo took over her body
    and she began to almost silently moan her way to an orgasm. She knew it was
    only the start of what she had been promised � and she was not looking forward
    to what else was in store for her. She could cope with the dildo for now,
    but knew that it would soon be painful as it continued its relentless fucking
    action inside her vulva. Her sex was becoming more sensitive and more tender
    with each stroke and, even as her second orgasm built to its inevitable climax,
    Ronnie began to feel the pain that this huge device was causing her. 
As the third orgasm mixed with the pain of the intrusive instrument,
    Ronnie remembered why she was here and knew she had no choice. She would
    just have to put up with whatever was going to be demanded of her. 
Dawson  watched with growing anticipation as the
    dildo on the end of the piston continued its unrelenting assault on the young
    woman's vagina. From the TV he could only see what was happening, there was
    no sound. Dawson  knew the ball gag would
    prevent Ronnie from doing little more than moan either from pleasure or from
    the growing pain brought by the powerful, rhythmical strokes of the device
    between her legs. 
Her fourth climax was building and Dawson  made
    the decision to continue in Craig's absence. He left the relative comfort
    of his lounge, crossed the hallway and opened the door to the downstairs
    cellar he had converted into his torture dungeon. 
As soon as he opened the door, he heard Ronnie groaning from behind
    the gag. She was also perspiring, her ample chest shimmering with the water
    droplets that had formed through the young woman's arousal. She was obviously
    building to a powerful climax as the dildo thrust its way deep into the very
    heart of her cunt. As the climax sent shock waves of pleasure from her vulva
    right to her brain, Ronnie struggled desperately to free herself from her
    bonds, but with no success. 
�Do you like the dildo?� Dawson  hissed
    through the mask he was now wearing. It would avoid his identity becoming
    known if the blindfold should slip off her eyes. He removed the ball gag
    so Ronnie could speak and even cry out if she wanted to. 
�Who the � what the � why the hell am I here?� Ronnie sounded scared � justifiably
    so as she had no idea who was holding her or what was going to happen to
    her and, to be frank, waking up with a giant dildo stroking your sex firmly
    and rhythmically while you are tied up in a strange, dark place, is hardly
    a scenario that would make most women feel comfortable. 
�You're here because you are unfaithful and you are going to learn
    a lesson you will not forget,� Dawson  hissed
    again, his face now close to hers. 
�Did Craig arrange this?� 
�You'll have to ask him that. All I am going to tell you is that within
    a very short space of time you are going to wish you had stayed faithful
    and been honest. Now, you little whore, I think it is time for you to feel
    a bit of pain.� 
With that, Dawson  turned a dial
    on the back of the box controlling the rate with which the dildo was thrusting
    in and out of Ronnie's well-probed cunt. The rate increased until the piston
    was pumping in and out of her at nearly four strokes a second. 
�Oh God,� said Ronnie as she felt the next climax building within
    her. �Oh God, that hurts,� she added as the excitement grew. As she became
    more aroused and her muscles contracted in the preliminaries of climax, the
    dildo did indeed cause the young woman pain. 
�Not been fucked like this before, have you?� Dawson  hissed
    as Ronnie cried out loudly with an �Arrggggghhhhh oh God, oh God, yes, yes,
    yessssssssssssss!' as the orgasm tore through her body. 
The dildo continued its unrelenting actions and when Ronnie had climbed
    back down from the peak, panting she begged, 
�Please, please it's hurting me. Please turn it off.� 
�Okay,� hissed Dawson  softly. �But
    you may wish it had not been turned off in a few minutes time.� 
�Why? What are you going to do to me?� 
�You are going to be taught a lesson you will not forget. Moreover
    if you fail to please your husband in future, or if you are unfaithful ever
    again, you will come back here and things will be twice as bad.� 
�I won't, I already told Craig that. Please don't hurt me.� 
�There's no gain without pain, you should know that. Your unfaithfulness
    caused others a lot of pain, and now you are going to reap your rewards and
    suffer in a similar way.� 
�What are you going to do?� Ronnie asked, relieved that the dildo
    had been switched off, though it was still buried in her vulva. 
She felt what seemed like thin pieces of string being trailed over
    her naked breasts. Her breasts were full in any event but the way she had
    been tied to the couch had pushed them up and made them even more prominent.
    Also, her rosy nipples were fiercely erect, the result of her multiple climaxes. 
The string-like things trailed over her breasts a second time and
    then she felt the sudden sting of what seemed like a thousand pin pricks
    as they whipped into her full, pale flesh with a force that made her cry
    out in pain. 
�Argggghhhhh!� Ronnie screamed as the fine leather straps on the end
    of the whip cut into her breasts again. It was the start of five minutes
    of pure hell for Ronnie. The third stroke landed ten seconds after the previous
    one, adding fresh marks to her otherwise unblemished flesh as the fresh stroke
    added its own weight of pain to her body. 
Lying prone as she was and securely tied to the couch, Ronnie could
    do nothing to avoid the onslaught of the torture brought to her by the whip.
    For Dawson , it was like playing with a
    new toy as he swung the whip over the tips of her breasts in stroke after
    stroke of pure, unbridled torture. 
By the sixth stroke Ronnie was sobbing loudly and her breasts were
    pinking up nicely. 
�Oh God, no. Sob! Please stop, I, sob, can't, sob, take any more.
    Sob!� Ronnie blubbed as the seventh stroke started the second minute of this
    particular piece of torture. 
�Oh, but you will learn to do exactly what you are told and when,
    and you will learn to be totally submissive to your partner. So, we will
    continue.� Dawson  replied as Ronnie let
    out another scream to prove the eighth application of the whip had hit its
    target. �And,� Dawson  continued, �when
    we have finished up here, we'll start between your legs. If you are truly
    sorry you will repent, and repentance means you will take what you so richly
    deserve. � 
�Oh God, NOOOOOOO!!!!� Ronnie howled, partly at the thought of having
    this torture applied to her sex and partly because the next stroke landed. 
Over the next couple of minutes her breasts went from pink to red
    and welt marks started to form in one or two places where the leather straplets
    had made their strongest contact. 
Dawson  stopped after five minutes and thirty strokes.
    He took hold of Ronnie's right breast in his hand and felt it all over carefully. 
�Not bad,� he mumbled to himself. Then he checked her left breast.
    Both felt fiery hot from the therapy and Ronnie was crying continually. 
�Ouch,� she cried as he touched the whipped flesh, though he was only
    holding her gently for examination purposes. 
�Learning your lesson?� Dawson  asked. 
�Yes, I'm learning. But I don't understand what I can do to stop this
    pain.� 
�Nothing really, not until you've learned your lesson.� 
�Please � there has to be something I can do. I'm really sorry and
    I do want to repent but please - the pain is unbearable on my breasts. If
    you whip my sex I'll probably die � can't you think of something else I have
    to do to show I am truly repentant?� 
�Sex?� Dawson  smirked, ignoring
    her plea. �Sex? That's a funny word. I want to hear you call it by its proper
    name.� 
�My vagina?� Ronnie answered. 
�No, not that.� 
�Pussy?� 
�No. What do all whores call it?� 
�I don't know,� Ronnie wailed as she felt the dildo being pulled out
    of her vulva in readiness for the next phase of her punishment. 
�Cunt, you whore, call it your cunt.� Dawson  hissed. 
�Oh, my cunt.� Ronnie sounded relieved. 
�And you will now beg me not to whip it.� 
�Please don't whip my cunt,� Ronnie said simply between her lessening
    sobs. 
�Please don't whip my cunt, MASTER!� Dawson  emphasised
    the final word. �For that is what I am. I am your master and so is your husband.
    From now on you will learn to do whatever we tell you, without question and
    without delay.� 
�You're not my master and nor is Craig. I'm my own master.� 
�Not any more. Let me explain,� Dawson  said
    and Ronnie immediately felt the leather stripes caressing her shaven sex
    lips. 
�You,� he said, as the first stroke of the whip landed dead centre
    between her pouting labia and Ronnie gasped with surprise. The stroke was
    not particularly strong, but with each word of the rest of his speech, Dawson
  delivered another similar stroke so the pain intensified as his speech continued. 
�You,� he repeated, �are now the property of Craig. You have given
    yourself to him, to submit to his every desire and to do what he demands
    of you. When he hands you over to me or anyone else, you will do what they
    demand of you. You will never hand yourself over to anyone, only Craig can
    do that. Do you understand?� 
The final stroke on the �understand� was a finishing stroke, somewhat
    more powerful than the others. 
�Ouch, ouch, ouch,� Ronnie cried, still unable to move on the couch. �Yes,
    I understand.� 
�Master,� Dawson  added for measure
    and added another stinging stroke of the whip too. 
�Master,� Ronnie howled with the pain. �What must I do for you, master?� She
    asked. �Just so the pain stops.� 
�Whatever I tell you to do. For now, I am going to allow you some
    more pleasure. I think the message has gotten home, at least in part, so
    I'm going to try out something new on you. Normally I save these things for
    my more experienced clients, but today I'm feeling generous.� 
�What is it master?� Ronnie asked, wondering what was going to happen
    to her next. 
�It's a MyCraby. It's sort of crab shaped and the makers say it is
    going to give you orgasms like you've never had before. We shall see.� 
�Well, I've already come quite a lot thanks to the dildo, so don't
    expect too much.� It was a mistake and Ronnie realised it the moment the
    words left her mouth but it was too late. 
�Oh I expect and I know you will give.� 
Ronnie felt his hand on her outer labia. She felt the labia being
    lifted up and squeezed slightly, just below her prominent clitoris. 
�With a clitoris like that you can't help but respond.� Dawson  laughed
    as Ronnie felt her other labia being lifted and then the slight squeezing
    sensation. When her labia were allowed to fall back into place she felt something
    strangely jelly-like yet more solid, sitting between her sex lips, something
    pressing firmly but gently into her clitoris. 
�Right, lets see how long this little chappie takes to get you going.� 
Dawson  connected the controller and trailed it back
    down the couch. Then he simply pressed the button and a soft humming sound
    filled the air. 
The clitoral stimulator pulsed its varied pattern of vibrations deep
    into Ronnie's throbbing bud. The contact between instrument and flesh was
    good, and without need for any lubricant it ensured the power of the tiny
    vibrations had greater impact on the young woman. The pattern of pulses changed
    regularly, building from gentle vibrations to much stronger ones, with pulses
    of energy that were released directly into the very sensitive clitoris over
    which the head of the crab had been secured. 
In just a few seconds, Ronnie was unwillingly starting on the road
    to a new climax, the muscles of her vulva contracting as the climax neared.
    She longed to be able to arch her back and savour the full effects of the
    pleasure, but she was secured very tightly and could not move. So she lay
    there at the mercy of the strange device that was held against her clitoris
    by her own labia. 
�Ahhhhh!� She gasped as the climax sent her over the top. The release
    was welcome after the cruel floggings. The little crab-shaped device between
    her legs did not falter but continued to stimulate her bud even as she climbed
    down off the peak. 
�See you in half an hour,� said Dawson  as
    he turned and walked out of the room. 
�No, don't go!� Ronnie called after him. �I can't take half an hour
    of thissssssss!� She gasped as her clitoris responded to the MyCraby and
    she built quickly to another orgasm. This one was more intense than the previous
    one and, as her clitoris was growing more sensitive by the minute, Ronnie
    felt the intense waves of pleasure more keenly as they flowed through her
    body. The urge to arch her back increased as a third orgasm began to build
    and, for several futile seconds, Ronnie struggled with her bonds. Finally
    the waves of the third climax flowed through her body and Ronnie lay back,
    gasping for air after her efforts. 
Dawson  went and made himself a cup of coffee. It
    was now after eight o'clock  and there
    was still no sign of Craig. 
Dawson sat down on the sofa and watched Ronnie evidently respond to
    the MyCraby again for her body was twitching and twisting as best it could
    under her bonds, a sure sign she was experiencing another enforced climax.
