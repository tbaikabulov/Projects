The Body Donor - The Subject
Provided By: BDSM Librarywww.bdsmlibrary.com
Synopsis: A young Air Force nurse is caught going AWOL and having an adulterous affair.  She is given two choices: court martial or volunteer for a medical program as a demonstration tool.
A trio of guards walked down the narrow hallway leading to the detention cells.  
One side of the wall was nearly bare, only a few stenciled warnings decorated 
the plain grey surface.  The iron bars of the cages lined the opposite wall, cages 
which held the "volunteers" captive.  Shadowy lines from armored light bulbs 
played across their uniforms as they paraded down the line of cells, their boots 
clicking on the cement floor.  The leader slowed and stopped in front of one cell, 
lifted his clipboard to check what was written there, and turned to the other two.  
"This is the one," he said, then turned his attention to the inhabitant of the cell 
and growled, "Subject Number 040502, you've been selected."

Inside, behind the iron bars, Subject Number 040502 was resting on her simple 
iron cot.  She was clad in a simple blue sleeveless uniform, her body clothed in 
two simple pieces of fabric held together by tied strings at the shoulders and 
waist, the hem ending just below her hips, barely low enough to cover her sex.  
The uniform was designed to allow access to her body by her supervisors during 
her training, and to teach her to become comfortable with a minimum of clothing. 
She rose slowly from the mattress, then as she had been trained, turned so that 
her back was to the guards as they opened the door to her cell.  She held her 
arms behind her back as two metal cuffs quickly snapped closed around her 
wrists and one of the guards, placing a hand on her shoulder, turned her to face 
her captors and directed her out of the cage.

She did not resist as she was led out of the facility and into a non-descript white 
panel van.  She was placed on a metal bench seat - the coldness of the metal 
causing her to gasp as it touched her skin - and restraints were placed around 
her waist and across her torso.  Chains welded to the floor of the van were 
fastened around her ankles, as an additional level of security.  A soft dark hood 
was placed over her head.  She heard the rear doors of the van slam shut 
followed by two rapid thumps, and the van motor coughed to life.

She wasn't sure how long she had been in the van, nor how far they had driven, 
when she heard the brakes squeal one final time.  She heard the doors open and 
some low mumblings about delivery confirmation.  She felt the shackles around 
her legs being removed as the restraints were released around her waist and 
torso.  Her hands remained securely cuffed behind her back, the hood still in 
place. A strange set of hands grasped her shoulders and guided her out of the 
van.  She could feel the chill of the air across her near-naked skin as she was 
paraded some distance across a paved walkway, then paused as a door was 
opened.  Another set of hands grabbed her and guided her down a hallway, the 
sounds of her bare feet padding against the granite were muted by the harsh 
clomping of the guards' boots.  She paused again and was led through another 
door before being set down in a seated position.  The strong hands fumbled 
under her hood, placing a collar around her neck.  She felt her head being jerked 
back as the collar was attached to something solid behind her, trapping her.

The hood was removed and she blinked several times, waiting for her eyes to 
adjust to the bright light of the room.  She could see a man behind a desk, 
papers spread before him, a desk lamp, a telephone, a laptop computer, a pen 
and pencil set to his right.  Behind him, a wall of plaques and certificates, the 
usual "Wall of Honors" she had become accustomed to in her former life as a 
surgical nurse.  It seemed so long ago.  The man lifted a file folder and 
addressed her.

"First, welcome to the Training Ward.  I'm Doctor Hernandez, the head of 
Research and Development at this facility."  The man appeared to be in his mid-
forties, with piercing dark eyes a full head of hair cut with military precision, well 
dressed and physically fit. "Second, I'd like to thank you for donating your body 
for the advancement of scientific research."  The woman snorted.  She'd been 
forced into this situation but at the time it seemed to be the better of the two 
choices she'd been offered at the base commander's office. There was nothing 
she could do but go along.  The doctored continued.  

"I've been examining the list of potential volunteers for our demonstrations and 
I've selected you based on your background in medical sciences.  It is my belief 
that, once you understand our goals, you will help us with our experiments and 
will give us your full cooperation.  Please believe me when I say that we consider 
you to be a very valuable asset to the program."

He paused, studying her eyes, looking to see if she would resist.  Subject 
Number 040502 sat passively in the chair, then asked in a low tone, "Are these 
restraints really necessary?"

"The chains are for your own protection.  In the past we've had difficulties with 
some volunteers that have caused injury to them and to their handlers. Because I 
felt that you were uniquely qualified for our endeavors, I wanted to be certain that 
you wouldn't be injured during transportation and initial interrogation.  We have a 
few rules here, that, if you obey, I will guarantee that you will not be harmed 
unless necessary.  First, you are not to speak unless spoken to.  Second, you 
are to do as you are told.  Third, you are to be completely honest and truthful in 
all statements and actions you make.  If you disobey any of these rules, you will 
be punished.  In exchange for your consent, I promise you that you will not suffer 
any lasting injuries, that you will not suffer unnecessarily, and that you will be 
afforded some recreational time when you are not involved in a demonstration or 
an experiment.  While you are here you will be under observation at all time and 
during demonstrations and experiments, you will be closely monitored and all of 
your actions will be recorded by multiple observers.  We have taken steps to 
ensure your safety during our use of your body, but you may be restrained during 
exercises to prevent these safety measures from being compromised by you or 
our staff. In exchange for your cooperation, since we are a licensed medical 
facility, we will provide you with whatever medical and dental care you may 
require during the term of your stay here.  Afterwards, you will be released from 
further responsibility to this hospital and may return to your former station or 
interview for a permanent testing position here should you choose to do so.  Do 
you agree to these terms?"

Subject Number 040502 considered the doctor's words for a moment, then softly 
murmured "yes".

"I congratulate you.  You are to be admired for the contribution you are about to 
make to modern medical science.  Officer, please remove the shackles from the 
subject."

The metal cuffs around her wrists and ankles were unfastened and collected by 
the guard.  She reached reflexively for her arms, working her fingers around the 
skin where the cuffs had bit into her wrists, then looked quickly at the doctor to 
make sure that she hadn't violated any rule he may have had.

"Go ahead.  You are entitled to some comforts now."  As she continued to rub 
her limbs, the doctor turned to his desk and said, "you will be issued a private 
room.  The room is equipped with cameras, but these will only be activated 
during any period that an experiment is running.  As a safety precaution, we will 
also be monitoring your stay in the room for the first few days you are here, just 
to make sure that you're comfortable with your new surroundings.  If we find that 
you are having difficulties adjusting to your new environment, we may provide a 
mild sedative to help you relax.  You'll find your new uniform in the room.  The 
uniform will be collected daily and you will be issued a fresh uniform to be worn 
as instructed.  The uniforms will vary based on the planned activity, and you will 
wear that uniform until it is removed from you.  You are not to remove your 
clothing unless otherwise instructed. Do you understand?"

The woman nodded her affirmation.

"Very well, then.  The officer will now escort you to your room."

Subject Number 040502 lay on her back doing stomach exercises.  Her handler, 
a muscular older man wearing a plain white t-shirt, white pants, and plain athletic 
shoes, hovered over her with a stopwatch.  She had been at the Kingdom Group 
facility for a few days but she hadn't been allowed to leave her room. There were 
no windows for her room and no clock on the wall.  The guards that fed her four 
times a day were careful to never wear a watch.  She had lost all track of time.

Her handler had formulated an exercise program consisting of push-ups, 
stomach exercises, leg lifts, and various other activities in order to maintain her 
health, and she followed his instructions precisely, both because she knew the 
value of exercise, and because she knew she would be punished if she 
disobeyed.  The meals she was given were low-fat, low-calorie, and low-sodium, 
and included various multi-vitamin supplements.   Urine samples were collected 
after each exercise session to check for chemical imbalances.  She considered 
the possibility that perhaps she was already part of an experiment. Blind 
experiments are not uncommon in science, she recalled. She grunted through 
the last five crunches and could feel her muscles starting to tighten and cramp.  
She pushed for one more but lacked the strength to finish it.

"Stop," the man barked, "75.  Stand up and proceed to the bathroom, sit on the 
toilet seat, and provide a sample."  He followed behind her, monitoring her.  The 
first few times he had done this, she had felt self-conscious about being watched 
while she did such an embarrassingly basic life function, but now she had gotten 
used to his careful stare and had no trouble urinating on command.  He collected 
her sample cup, sealed it, and made a cryptic notation on the side.

"Turn around with your back to me."  After she had turned, the man tugged at the 
knots holding her uniform.  She stood still as the fabric cascaded off her body 
and collapsed into a pile on the floor.  "Step out of your uniform and bath 
yourself.  Evacuate your bowels if you feel the need.  You will be provided the 
day's uniform when you are summoned."  The man then turned and exited, 
closing the door behind him.  She could hear the metallic click of the automatic 
lock sliding into place.

This was the first time he had specifically mentioned that she would be 
summoned.  Did this mean that they felt she was ready to be used?

She stepped into the shower and turned on the faucet.  The water felt cool 
against her warm body, the clean water washing the salty drops of sweat from 
her skin as it fell down against her.  She had been provided liquid soap but no 
sponge to apply it, forcing her to use her hands to wipe the suds across her skin.  
She started with the flat expanse of her tummy then moved her hands upwards 
to lather her breasts and arms. She began to daydream about the last time she'd 
had sex.  It seemed so long ago, another life.  She cupped her breasts, rubbing 
her thumbs against her nipples, letting them perk and rise.  It felt good.  She 
wondered if she was being monitored by the camera that continuously panned 
across the bathroom.  Her shower had no curtain and she felt exposed to the 
world.  Fighting the urge to answer her growing passion, she collected a pool of 
shampoo in her palms and smeared it into her hair, feeling her breasts lift as she 
raised her arms up to clean her hair.  She could feel the tingling between her 
thighs and could no longer resist the demands of her libido.  

She ran her palms down the length of her torso as if to massage the blood into 
her vulva, letting her fingernails brush across her hips, stroking the thin line of 
pubic hair softly before slipping a finger beneath the lips of her sex.  She moaned 
slightly as her finger found the delicate head of her clitoris.  She leaned back 
against the tiled wall and spread her legs, letting the water cascade onto her 
chest, trickling between the furrow of her breasts and running down her body 
until it mixed with the juices of her passion. She didn't care who was watching.  
She needed to feel sexual release.

Suddenly the temperature of the water dropped 10 degrees, shocking her 
system.  The door to her room burst open and several guards charged in towards 
her.  Two men seized her arms and pulled her physically out of the stall while a 
third began toweling the droplets of water from her body.  She closed her legs 
clumsily, trying to hide herself from the patting towel of the guard as the other two 
men supported the weight of her body.  Another man stood back by her bed and 
held a small bundle of clothing.  It was this man that spoke to her.

"Subject Number 040502, you are hereby summoned to participate in an 
exercise in the study of the human body."  The man extended the clothing 
towards her." You will dress yourself in this outfit.  Any hesitation will be deemed 
to be disobeyance of an order and grounds for punishment."

The guards released the woman's arms as the man let the material unravel, 
revealing the outfit.  It was a near-duplicate of the uniforms she had worn before, 
but the material was sheer, slightly pink in color, with trim along the edges.  Like 
the other uniforms she had been forced to wear, this one was open at the sides 
and cut high on the leg.  Ties held the two halves together.  Frustrated by the 
intrusion of the guards during her moment of private pleasure, the woman 
snatched the clothing from the man's hand and angrily slipped it over her head.  
She quickly tied the knots at the waist and dropped her hands to show that she 
was dressed.  The man gestured towards the door as the guards stood ready to 
escort her to the demonstration room.

"At ease, Lieutenant, and please have a seat.  This shouldn't take long but you 
might as well be comfortable."

Lt. Malia Hernandez relaxed and sat in the guest chair in front of the base 
commander's desk.  She straightened her medical service blouse as she sat 
down, curious as to what this sudden meeting was about.  Whatever it was, it 
was important enough for JAG to send down two attorneys.  And important 
enough to pull her off her daily ward assignment and transfer her tasks to the 
other nurses.

"Lt. Hernandez, this Captain Thom and Major Christopher from JAG.  Captain 
Thom is here to represent the interests of the Air Force and Major Christopher is 
here to represent you in these discussions.  I'm going to be blunt, Lieutenant.  
We know you have been AWOL several times during your stay on this base, as 
recent as last night.  We also know why � so that you could engage in sexual 
relations with a married man at a local hotel.  This conduct is unbecoming of an 
officer of the United States military and normally we would hold a tribunal for a 
court martial.  Fortunately for you, a series of circumstances exist which may 
work in your favor.  First of all, there is a shortage of trained medical personnel.  
The private sector has been making aggressive recruiting efforts and many 
highly trained people have ended their military careers in order to accept other 
opportunities.  This has created a vacuum that we've been struggling to fill.  To 
address the shortage of personnel, the base hospital here has been designated 
to be a training hospital for new medical cadets.  This has created a new problem 
� finding training equipment and instructors.  I am prepared to offer you an 
opportunity in the base hospital in the training section.  If you decline this offer, 
my only other recourse is to have you court-martialed and you will be given a 
Dishonorable Discharge, which most certainly would ruin your nursing career in 
the private sector."

Lieutenant Hernandez weighed her options.  The choice was obvious, but it 
seemed too easy to make.  She had learned that, in the military, there's always a 
catch.

"Would I be an instructor?  Or just an aid?" she asked.

"Neither.  You would be 'training equipment'", the commander replied.

Malia was puzzled.  The commander explained that one of the shortages was in 
research and development.

"You want me to be a human guinea pig?" she challenged.

"Something like that.  You wouldn't be harmed, of course.  Most of your 
involvement would be restricted to medical training, such as being used by 
medical cadets learning to give gynecological exams.  I'm certain, given your 
career experience, you're aware that checking for proper uteral and ovarial 
development requires a skillful touch and a learned hand."  Malia nodded.  She'd 
witnessed it first-hand herself. The commander continued. "You may be 
subjected to some rigorous exercises, such as testing of g-force limitations in 
new flight suits, improved lightweight helmet designs for women, and that sort of 
thing, but nothing that would involve a high risk of permanent injury."

Malia was silent, weighing her decision.

Major Christopher said, "I know you're apprehensive about this, but I've reviewed 
the paperwork and, while there is some risk involved in what they have planned, 
there are steps being taken to ensure your safety at all times.  Considering the 
alternative, this would be a short amount of discomfort with a long-term benefit; 
for you and the Air Force.  All you would need to do is volunteer for the training 
assignment."

Lt. Hernandez studied the Major's face, then looked at her commanding officer, 
then at Captain Thom.  They had her backed into a corner.

"Ok, I'll volunteer," she whispered, submitting to their pressures.

"Very well, sign these transfer papers and then my assistant will escort you over 
to Receiving where you will be processed and assigned new quarters during your 
orientation period."

Lt. Malia Hernandez quickly signed the papers, not bothering to read them since 
they just appeared to contain nothing but disclaimers and legal mumbo-jumbo.  
She slid the papers towards Captain Thom, who countersigned and placed them 
in a manila folder.

"Oh, one more thing I should add," Captain Thom said, "since you've 
demonstrated criminal tendencies and a propensity to leave the base, its been 
agreed upon by the Air Force and Major Christopher than you would need to be 
restrained when you are not otherwise in your quarters.  Corporal!"

The door opened and a burly guard in duty fatigues opened the door.  "Yes, sir!"

"Please restrain Lt. Hernandez and escort her over to Detention for processing."

"Yes, sir!  Lieutenant Hernandez, please place your hands behind your back, 
ma'am!"  the corporal said firmly.

Malia complied and two strong silver handcuffs snapped shut over her wrists.

"Come with me, ma'am," the corporal barked, placing his hand on her back and 
pushing her towards the doorway.

It would be the last time she would be referred to as Lieutenant Malia Hernandez 
of the United States Air Force.
