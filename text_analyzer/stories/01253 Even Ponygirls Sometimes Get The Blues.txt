Synopsis: More adventures of Jessica and Kate as they attempt to escape their naked and chained imprisonment on Rabbit Island. They are smart girls but somehow their captors always seem to get the upper hand. This time they determined to outwit their so-called Masters. Like the previous story, Rabbit Island, this is a leisurely-paced tale of female bondage, punishment, fulfillment and wicked games, non-consensual but generally light and sexy in tone. The story is being posted as I write it, so any reviews and feedback (good or bad) are welcomed.  
     
        Chapter 1. Life&#146;s a Beach 
        (Even Ponygirls Sometimes Get the Blues, Aurelius c. 2002) 
         
       
      It was a fine evening for a walk along the beach.  
      On Rabbit Island every evening was a fine evening for a walk along
        the beach! The scenery, the tropical climate and the idyllic location
        made it so. 
      Kate and Jessica ambled bare-foot across the soft wet sand at the
        water&#146;s edge, both captivated by the radiance of the pumpkin red
        sun sinking rapidly on the maritime horizon. They marvelled how much
        quicker the sun set in this equatorial region compare to their former
        homes in more northerly latitudes.  
      They walked side by side, the best of friends, the American and
        the English girl. The New Yorker, Jessica with her brown hair in a ponytail,
        tall and shapely alongside Kate, a sun-bleached blonde, smaller, slimmer
        and, some might say, cuter than her American friend. 
      The beach cabin, their current home, had disappeared from sight
        behind them, and likewise their fellow occupants. There wasn&#146;t another
        soul in sight, or within earshot, which was exactly as Jessica planned. 
      &#147;So....tonight&#146;s the night?&#148; 
      &#147;Yep! Tonight&#146;s the night, Katie. We've been on this
        island for long enough. It&#146;s your choice whether you come with me.
        Either way, I&#146;m going.&#148; Jessica stared at her friend with steely
        determination in her eyes. 
      Kate had become adjusted to life on the island, but Jessica never
        could. She wanted to return to New York, to her family and friends. A
        place where she was useful to others; where she was needed and relied
        upon. 
      &#147;What do we do next?&#148; Kate asked, becoming edgy at the
        thought of leaving. 
      &#147;When you arrive back to the cabin try to act normally. Let&#146;s
        just spend a normal evening with them.Try not to seem anxious. At bedtime,
        go to bed and try to sleep. I&#146;ll wake you when it&#146;s time to
        go.&#148; 
      They sat down on the sand, and leaned back against two sides of
        a thick square wooden post. It was a whipping post. One where each of
        them had been chained up and punished many times. Despite its associations,
        it remained a pleasant spot where they could sit and talk and think,
        and sometimes make love. 
      &#147;These handcuffs. How can we get rid of them?&#148; Kate asked,
        tugging irritably on the links that secured her hands behind her. 
      Jessica gave her a self-satisfied smile. &#147;Don&#146;t worry.
        I&#146;ve got a plan, but it&#146;s best you don&#146;t know the details
        in case you decide not to come along.&#148; 
      Kate agreed that made sense. What if she was forced to reveal Jessica&#146;s
        plan to somebody? That could spell big trouble for both of them. 
      &#147;God, I&#146;m nervous. Maybe I&#146;ll take one last visit
        to the prods. That might relax me a bit.&#148; 
      &#147;Good idea Katie. Mind if I come and watch?&#148; 
      She gave Jessica a broad smile. &#147;Of course not! What about
        you?&#148; 
      Jessica shook her head sadly. &#147;No. I&#146;m still sore from
        what those bastards did to me three days ago.&#148; 
      The two naked women rose to their feet gracefully, considering
        that each had her hands cuffed behind her. Additionally a thick chain
        ran up their spines, linking the steel handcuffs to a sturdy leather
        collar. It&#146;s purpose was to prevent the slipping the handcuffs under
        her buttocks to the front. Apart from the cuffs, the collar and the connecting
        chain, they were naked. They did, however, have an item of jewelry each:
        Large pearl stud earrings, quite pretty in their way, but these pearls
        were fake. They were tracking devices, permanently fixed. 
      That was how they lived - the Island&#146;s so-called &#145;bunnies&#146; free
        to roam within the confines of their beach until their owners inhabiting
        the Island&#146;s palatial lodge required their bodies. Then they would
        be rounded up and transported to the Lodge to endure days and nights
        of sexual abuse, extreme bondage and punishments. Their time on the beach
        was tolerable by comparison, despite their ever-present handcuffs.  
      The prods were a short walk away. These were one type of
        many devices of training, punishment and correction that were positioned
        along the beach.  
      They arrived at Kate&#146;s favourite prod - a piece of equipment
        she had been punished on many times. It was a metal structure like a
        door frame in size and shape. The bunny was required to kneel on her
        shins at the base, where shackles were waiting to fix her ankles firmly
        in position. She then had to lower her hips so the thick dildo-like prod
        rising up between her ankles disappeared up into her pussy. Once her
        handler was satisfied with the seating of the prod within her vagina,
        he had a method of keeping it that way: A chain fixed at the front base
        of the prod was wrapped around the bunny&#146;s waist and padlocked.
        The bunny could forget about lifting herself clear of the prod without
        first being free of the chain about her waist. Unfortunately her movement
        towards a seated position was limited by the size of her vagina, which
        was vastly exceeded in length by the prod. Unless her uterus was made
        of steel the bunny was strongly advised against attempting to sit back
        on her heels! 
      The handler could either leave the bunny&#146;s wrists in handcuffs
        behind her back, or more usually refix them so her hands were chained
        the top of the frame above her head. Thus positioned, the bunny&#146;s
        bare back and buttocks made an attractive target for the whip. The bunny
        would have no alternative but to ride up and down on the prod in response
        to the whip. If she was lucky the tension of the chain holding up her
        arms would be tight enough to hold her upright thus preventing her sitting
        back. However, experienced handlers usually ensured that there was enough
        slack to leave the bunny&#146;s sitting position to her own judgement. 
      Although it was an implement of frequent punishments it did not
        alter the fact that this equipment provided an excellent means of masturbation.
        Kate wiped the prod with a clean scrap of bed sheet that she had earlier
        moistened with a lubricant. It was thicker and longer than a normal man&#146;s
        penis, sculpted with ridges too, to generate an effective friction. She
        knelt back gently and could feel the head of the prod against her labia.
        Closing her eyes and thinking her own thoughts about the man she would
        like to be fucking, she gyrated her hips until it felt like the prod
        was trying to enter her. Very gently she lowered herself onto the prod
        until it filled her, her face registered a broad contented grin. 
      Jessica stood quietly in the shadows a few yards away, preoccupied
        yet also slightly aroused by Kate&#146;s wanton display. If her hands
        weren't cuffed behind her Jessica knew where they would be. The handcuffs
        were an aid to self control and yet a cause of constant frustration! 
      Kate&#146;s gentle movements were like a dance, her gentle moaning
        like a song. Her delicate orgasm a thing of beauty. Jessica might once
        have found such an act distasteful but she knew that Kate couldn&#146;t
        help herself. It was the drugs in their food, they seemed to feed their
        sexual appetites. Kate&#146;s behaviour was shared to some degree by
        all eight bunnies in their camp. 
      Jessica recalled the more violent orgasms Kate had when she was
        properly secured to the prod. One of the handlers, Ray, knew exactly
        what to do with the girl. He would strike her with the bullwhip which
        was usually attached Indiana Jones-style to his belt. He seemed to play
        her body like a musical instrument and she responded as if in the hands
        of a virtuoso. Ray and Kate had won a recent competition for &#145;best
        whip-induced orgasm&#146;. Ray received the prize, a bottle of Glenlivet
        single malt whiskey plus the admiration of his peers. Kate was left hanging
        by her wrists within the frame, her only reward was her orgasm. 
      AN EARLY START 
      Much later in the evening, when Kate and Jessica returned to the
        cabin, everything was quiet; and dark except for the low wattage night-light
        that cast a faint glow over the entrance. 
      Inside, laying on the padded sleeping platforms were the six other
      bunnies who shared the cabin. Each was cocooned in a white sheet that she
      wrapped around herself, like self-mummification.  
      Jessica picked up her white sheet between her teeth. With several
      quick spins she managed to wrap herself snugly within the sheet. She leant
      forward and toppled softly onto the vinyl covered padding that served as
      a mattress. If she could bind herself tight enough with the sheet she could
      pretend it was the sheet that held her, rather than the intractable steel
      cuffs around her wrists. Soon the self-mummified Kate flopped onto the
      padding besides Jessica. Kate was so uptight she wondered if she could
      sleep a wink that night, but somehow she managed it. The prod had served
      its purpose. 
       
      Some hours later, Jessica rose silently from the bed as if by an
        internal alarm clock. She sat outside waiting until for the moon to reach
        a particular point on the horizon. For many weeks previously she had
        studied the night sky and began to understand the moon&#146;s movements.
        It was around two hours before dawn she deduced. Kate awoke to a gentle
        kiss on her lips, more of a touch than a kiss. Just like Jessica&#146;s
        own father did to her when she had to rise early. 
      &#147;It&#146;s me, Katie,&#148; Jessica whispered. &#147;Are you
        coming?&#148; 
      Kate&#146;s smile seemed to light up the gloom and gave Jessica
        the answer she hoped for. She stood up and the sheet that wrapped her
        slipped to the floor around her feet. 
      They left the cabin, neither saying a word as they walked into
        the distance. There was nothing to pack, no supplies, no change of clothing.
        They hadn&#146;t any possessions because they were the possessions,
        the slaves of others. If all went according to Jessica&#146;s plan this
        would be the last day of their slavery. 
      Their bare feet were hardened to the sandy beach but the gravel
        tracks on which they had to traverse the island hurt their feet, though
        they made navigation easy. All the points of interest on the island were
        linked by the network of tracks. Their first point of interest tonight
        was the mud pool; one of many &#145;sporting&#146; facilities on the
        island.  
      &#147;In you get, Katie, and make sure you cover your face with
        mud.&#148;  
      Kate stepped cautiously in, and Jessica followed her into the cool
        mud. Both rolled over until completely caked in the soft wet mud that
        would provide their camouflage. 
      The two handcuffed mud creatures resumed the journey along the
        trail, the breeze gradually drying the mud thick against their skin,
        caked thick against their faces and hair. 
      Kate chuckled as she recalled something. &#147;Do you remember
        when they arranged that mud fight?&#148; 
      &#147;Oh yes. I remember all too well!&#148; 
      &#147;...but it wasn&#146;t fair that I had to fight you. You have
        three inches and ten pounds over me.&#148; 
      &#147;Yes, but you were squirming like a little eel, Katie. It
        was damn hard work to get those cuffs around your wrists... and all I
        got for winning the competition was to compete against a man. In the
        end I had to let him handcuff me before I choked on the mud.&#148; 
      &#147;....and we all looked so disgusting that none of the visitors
        wanted to fuck us. They just hogtied us all with the leather cords and
        continued with their barbecue!&#148; Both laughed at the recollection
        as they walked. Such was the stuff of bunnies&#146; memories when they
        had been on the island for too long.  
      Their next stop was the Orchard: A complex of farm buildings that
        made the island self-sufficient in many fruits and vegetables, not to
        mention pigs, poultry, eggs and honey. 
      It was still dark, and eerily quiet throughout the complex of buildings.
        Close by, Jessica knew that a dozen people slept: The farm managers and
        the farm-bunnies, and even a couple of lazy dogs, that had long forgotten
        that they were supposed to be watch dogs. 
      Kate and Jessica stepped quietly around the corner of the yard
        to where the workshop door was located. 
      There was a creaking sound, and both jumped in fright. Someone
        was standing alongside the workshop wall. The moonlight briefly illuminated
        the whites of somebody&#146;s eyes, though the person was motionless. 
      Jessica realised the person was standing at the Orchard&#146;s
        punishment post. It wasn&#146;t a sentry, just a poor farm-bunny chained
        hand and foot to the post. Gagged as well, Jessica realised as she approached
        to the sound of muffled cries. The chained-up woman&#146;s eyes widened
        in fright as Jessica moved nearer. The farm-bunny feared she had been
        chained out as a sacrifice to the swamp monsters. 
      &#147;Hi Odette. It&#146;s me - Jessica! I didn&#146;t mean to
        scare you.&#148;  
      The ball-gagged farm-bunny Odette mumbled something incomprehensible
        in reply, sighing in obvious relief. 
      &#147;Did you fix the door?&#148; Jessica whispered to her. A little
        bit of sympathy for the chained up farm-bunny might have been due but
        Jessica had bigger concerns. Odette nodded. She had tampered with the
        workshop door so it could be sprung open without a key. Her loitering
        in the workshop to arrange it was what had caused her to be in that predicament! 
      Jessica knelt down and leaned back against the door. Her fingertips
        found the bottom edge and lifted it. She felt the door free itself from
        the latch. While Kate kept a look-out, Jessica groped around in the darkness
        of the workshop. She located a hacksaw, a hammer and a screwdriver; the
        very things she came for. She emerged from the workshop, quietly closing
        the door, then planted a grateful kiss on Odette's cheek. (When the farm
        managers saw Odette in the morning they would be mystified by the smear
        of mud on her face!) 
      The two bunnies walked the final couple of miles to the small harbour
        on the eastern side of the island. Their muddy camouflage a precaution
        against any early risers watching the trails. 
      &#147;There it is! The means of our salvation.&#148; Jessica announced
        proudly as they looked down at the fifty-foot fishing boat. The sky was
        already showing signs of dawn. &#147;Okay Katie, stretch your wrists
        out on that rock.&#148; 
      Jessica held the hacksaw behind her back as best she could with
        her hands cuffed, and sawed gently on a link. It proved more difficult
        than she imagined, after a couple of exhausting minutes she had made
        barely a groove. After a quick breather she resumed, sawing until the
        top of the sun broke the horizon. 
      &#147;Dammit!&#148; Jessica tossed away the hacksaw in frustration. &#147;Sorry
        Katie, it looks like we&#146;ll have to wear these cuffs for a while
        longer. Someone will soon remove them when we get to the mainland. Let&#146;s
        get on the boat.&#148; 
      The two fugitives made their way down the track leading to the
        boat. It was easy to board the fishing boat; the gang-plank had been
        left in position. Jessica clearly knew where she was going. &#147;Have
        you got the screwdriver?&#148; 
      Kate handed the large tool to her. &#147;What&#146;s down there?&#148; 
      &#147;It&#146;s the rope locker, pretty small, but we&#146;ll fit
        in.&#148; Jessica started to prise the door open near to the lock. To
        Kate&#146;s amazement it popped open. 
      &#147;How....what.....how did you do that?&#148; Kate asked, astonished
        at her friend&#146;s ingenuity. 
      &#147;Easy! Sarah told me, she saw the captain do it once when
        he forgot the key; and she also told me about the space in the rope locker
        too. Now we just crawl in, make ourselves comfortable, keep quiet and
        we&#146;re home and dry. Take your last look at Rabbit Island Katie!
        We&#146;re going home. Free from these handcuffs, free from being a slave
        to perverted men&#146;s desires. No more whippings! No more chains!&#148; Jessica
        effused triumphantly. 
      Kate turned to look at the island as it became bathed in early
        morning sunlight, her eyes moist with tears. She didn&#146;t know what
        she wanted anymore. It was a scary thought to leave the island after
        more than a year. She was a prisoner, a sex-slave; but it hadn&#146;t
        been all bad. It would take some getting used to normal life full of
        responsibilities again. She knew she would miss Ray terribly - the handler
        who seemed to know more about what her body needed than even she did. 
      They crawled inside the dirty and damp locker. Digging themselves
        toward the back so that the thick ropes all but covered them. Jessica
        leaned over one last time and pulled the door closed, leaving them snuggled
        together in complete darkness, hoping and praying that the captain would
        make his normal trip to the mainland. 
      
         *** 
       
      The fugitive bunnies were sound asleep when they heard footsteps
        on the boat. Whoever it was seemed to wander around for an age, looking
        for something perhaps? Had he seen something suspicious? Maybe someone
        had leaked Jessica&#146;s well-laid plans? 
      Miguel the fisherman, and captain of this small vessel, fired up
        the diesel engine and cast off the mooring ropes. He was where he loved
        to be - on the water. The Lodge&#146;s visitors didn&#146;t just enjoy
        the subservient charms of the bunnies but also enjoyed sports like shooting,
        diving, sea fishing. The latter being Miguel&#146;s prime responsibility.
        It was a fine morning for fishing but today he had to make a trip a the
        nearby island to collect the weekly supplies. He had no inkling that
        his regular routine had long been Jessica&#146;s planned escape route. 
      After an hour&#146;s calm progress at six knots he docked in the
        little port. The boat&#146;s engine fell silent and the sound of Miguel&#146;s
        footsteps indicated to the girls that he had disembarked. A safe ten
        minutes later Jessica and Kate crawled from the rope locker to make their
        final step to freedom. 
      The bunnies emerged onto the deck, dazed by the bright sunlight.
        They were in the midst of a bustling harbour packed full of fishing boats
        and other craft. How could two mud-caked naked girls begin to explain
        their situation to others? They didn&#146;t even know what country they
        were in! 
      Walking tentatively down the busy jetty, their salvation came in
        to view - a police car parked at the side of the dock. &#147;Pollisia&#148; it
        said, whatever language that was. A man in a smart uniform looked like
        the policeman, and his mirrored shades left them in no doubt. 
      A curious crowd started to gather at a respectful distance as Jessica
        and Kate walked towards the police car. Some in the crowd were sighing
        in horror. Others were just shaking their heads in disbelieve and disapproval.
        Was it Jessica&#146;s imagination or had the noisy bustle of the harbour
        fallen silent? What did it matter what people thought? The important
        thing was that now they were finally free. 
      &#147;Hello. Do you speak English?&#148; Jessica called out as
        she approached the policeman. Kate and Jessica&#146;s smiles were in
        dramatic contrast to their mud-caked bodies. 
      &#147;I speak leetle English.&#148; The policeman replied guardedly,
        trying to take in the sight before him. He liked a naked woman as much
        as the next man but these two were just disgusting. 
      &#147;We need your help. We&#146;ve been kidnapped and held against
        our will on a nearby island.&#148; Jessica rotated her torso slightly
        to show off her handcuffs and chain. 
      &#147;Madam. Me no unnerstan. You go pollisia house me now!&#148; 
      &#147;Yes, yes, we go with you!&#148; Jessica and Kate responded excitedly.
      Perfect! They were going straight to a police station. 
       
      They walked with the policeman towards his patrol car. Then he changed
      his mind, looking first at his admirably clean squad car and the flaking
      dirt that covered their bodies.  
       
      &#147;No car you! My friend car you.&#148; He gestured toward an
        old Ford pickup truck next to the patrol car. The policeman grabbed Jessica
        by the elbow and helped her step up into the back of the truck. Kate
        followed. 
      &#147;Here!&#148; The policeman prodded them into a sitting position,
        bare buttocks flat against the steel truck floor. The women sat leaning
        back against the cabin while the policeman used a length of rope to thread
        through the D rings on their collars, securing it tightly to convenient
        cleats. &#147;This good you!&#148; He explained helpfully. 
      Jessica shrugged her shoulders at Kate - one of the easier gestures
        to make when your hands are cuffed. &#147;So... he doesn&#146;t want
        to get his car dirty. Who can blame him? He&#146;s tied us like this
        for our own safety so we don&#146;t roll around. We&#146;ll soon be at
        the police station and have this mess sorted out.&#148; 
      The truck set off and wound its way through the narrow congested
        streets of the town. People stared, not quite believing the sight of
        two naked, dirty-faced matted-haired females riding in the back of a
        pickup. Savages from the rain forests, they supposed. 
      &#147;Where the hell are we?&#148; Kate asked Jessica, as the pickup
        bumped along endless potholed streets. She was fascinated by the sights
        around her. It was a large and busy town, not poor by Asian standards
        but not rich either. The people were dark-skinned with round oriental
        eyes. 
      &#147;Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Borneo, we could be anywhere!
        The women are wearing head-scarves so maybe it&#146;s a Muslim country,
        but it&#146;s not just Muslims who dress like that.&#148; (Jessica had
        completed her cultural awareness classes in New York.) 
      The police car and the pickup reached the police station, driving
        straight into a gated compound. The station house within the compound
        was a simple two storey concrete building. The policeman untied Jessica
        and Kate from the pickup and led them into the building, along a corridor
        until they arrived at a closed door. He knocked and promptly entered
        with Jessica and Kate in tow. 
      Sat comfortably behind a large desk was the police chief. Dark-skinned,
        with a well-tended mustache, and overweight from good living. A broad
        grin was on his face. 
      &#147;Welcome to my humble police station!&#148; The gregarious
        police chief called out to his visitors, his arms spread wide. &#147;You
        are from the island, no?&#148; 
      Jessica stepped forward. &#147;Yes Sir, but we&#146;ve managed
        to escape. Can you remove our handcuffs and find some clothes for us?&#148; 
      &#147;I am sorry madame. I do not have a key for your handcuffs.
        I am afraid you must keep the cuffs until this matter is resolved. Abdi,
        your arresting officer will take you into the yard and clean you before
        the judge arrives.&#148; 
      Two mouths fell open in shock. &#147;Arresting officer?... Judge?...
        What the hell are you talking about? It&#146;s the guys on Rabbit Island
        you should be arresting,&#148; Kate protested. 
      The police chief sat up straight, put his elbows on the table and
        interlocked his fingers. The mood had changed. He looked at them gravely. &#147;Madams,
        you fail to understand something. You have displayed your naked bodies
        in our town. Our people are religious and moral, believing in modest
        dignified behaviour. They will not tolerate obscene displays such as
        yours. The judge will sentence you this afternoon. As for the island
        you have come from - it is an independent country. Even if I believed
        that you were kidnapped I have no jurisdiction over them. Now, go with
        Abdi and get cleaned up.&#148; 
      Their arresting officer and a young man, a police cadet, led them
        back outside into the compound. &#147;Stay!&#148; Abdi said, while connecting
        a hose to a faucet on the wall. He pointed the jet of cold water at the
        bunnies, making sure they were thoroughly soaking. The junior went into
        action with a scrubbing brush, intent on getting the mud out of every
        crevice.  
      Feeling the harsh bristles between her legs Kate was pleading &#147;no...no...&#148; as
        she felt him scrub a layer of skin from her body, but her pleading was
        met with a smile. Kate and Jessica&#146;s nipples were soon erect due
        to the cold water, and that did not escape the notice of the policeman.
        He grasped one of Jessica&#146;s impressively large nipples between finger
        and thumb and used the brush in the other hand to ensure her breasts
        were scrubbed clean. He decided the nipple made a good handle for keeping
        Jessica in position while brushing vigorously over her pussy. Kate received
        similar treatment from the diligent young police-cadet. 
      After unexpectedly having their hair shampooed, the spruced-up
        bunnies were left to &#145;drip dry&#146; in the yard. Despite the rough
        handling they were happy that the mud was washed from their hair and
        bodies. The hot sun and the whitewashed walls soon dried them. Kate had
        become increasing morose during her time in the police station, wishing
        only that she was back on Rabbit Island with her friends. 
      Jessica remained optimistic. &#147;Don&#146;t worry Katie, when
        the judge gets here it will all be resolved.&#148; She kissed her friend
        on the shoulder, a gesture that corresponded to a hug for the perpetually
        chained bunnies. The door of the police building opened. 
      &#147;Come to Judge now!&#148; Abdi shouted at them from the doorway. 
      The small courtroom was wood-panelled but spartan in layout. The
        judge, wearing a wig and gown that betrayed the town&#146;s colonial
        roots, sat behind a desk on a low platform. 
      &quot;Kneel down, and do not speak!&#148; the police chief quietly
        instructed them. Jessica and Kate knelt obediently, with well-practiced
        submissiveness, in the centre of the courtroom floor, nervous but still
        optimistic. &#147;Now look up at the judge!&#148; The police chief said,
        satisfied with their position. 
      The judge entered. They looked up towards a thin and frail old
        man with a wrinkled face. He looked back at two beautiful young naked
        women, kneeling before him, but their charms were lost on him. He didn&#146;t
        care for decadent westerners parading themselves in his town. 
      &#147;Look down at the floor, and don&#146;t look up until I tell
        you.&#148; The police chief whispered. 
      The grim-faced judge spoke in their incomprehensible native language
        to the Police Chief. He responded at length in the same tongue. Abdi,
        their arresting officer, was also quizzed by the judge. After several
        further exchanges between them the elderly judge banged his gavel on
        the table and shuffled from the courtroom. 
      &#147;Good news ladies! You are not going to jail.&#148; The police
        chief said with his familiar broad smile, whilst helping them to their
        feet. &#147;You&#146;ll each get ten lashes this afternoon and then you
        are free to go. I think the judge took pity on you.&#148; 
      Jessica shook herself free from the police chief&#146;s grasp. &#147;Wait
        a minute....you mean that was our trial? We didn&#146;t have a chance
        to speak, we didn&#146;t have any legal representation and we couldn&#146;t
        understand a word that was said. That wasn&#146;t a fair trial.&#148; 
      &#147;Madam, you must be thinking of a different country, where
        greedy and corrupt lawyers make fortunes with their clever words; where
        murderers and bad men walk free because of their ability to subvert the
        legal system. In this country it is different. The police officer explains
        to the judge what happened and the judge, in his wisdom, passes the sentence.
        It is a much fairer system!&#148; 
      The convicted women were taken from the courtroom to a room they
        hadn&#146;t seen before.  
      &#147;Down,&#148; Abdi said, making Jessica lay face down on the
        floor. Her neck was resting in a semicircular cut-out of a set of portable
        wooden stocks. Much to her surprise her handcuffs were unlocked by the
        police officer, contradicting their earlier statement about not having
        keys for them. But ominously, her collar and chain ensemble remained.
        Her wrists were positioned into the semicircular cutouts in the stock
        a foot away, either side of her neck. While one policeman held her wrists
        in position the other closed the other half of hinged stock onto the
        back of her neck and wrists The firm click of a padlock indicated it
        would stay in position. Kate received the same treatment. 
      &#147;I trust you will not find our stocks too uncomfortable. Now
        ladies, would you please stand. I still have duties to perform.&#148; The
        police chief had a battered old camera in his hand. &#147;As you are
        convicted criminals in our country we need to complete our records with
        a photograph.&#148; 
      He pinned a piece of paper to the front of the stocks, below the
        chin of each of them; their conviction sheets. &#147;Okay, look directly
        at the camera.&#148;  
      Their scowls could have broken a less robust camera lens. &#148;Okay,
        Perfect!&#148; He put down the camera and reached for his clipboard. &#147;Any
        distinguishing marks?&#148; He asked. 
      The bunnies looked at each other, thinking the same thing. &#147;Like
        a tattoo?&#148; Jessica asked. 
      &#147;Exactly, but I do not see any tattoos. Show me.&#148; 
      They turned their backs on him spread their legs and bent double
        at the waist. &#147;Just at the top of the left thigh on the inside.&#148; 
      It wasn&#146;t every day that the police chief was invited to inspect
        two women in this way. Two shapely rumps presented themselves for inspection,
        their prominent puffy labia seeming to give an invitation to him. He
        spotted the tattoo an inch away from the labia, a thumbnail-sized, side
        view of a rabbit (quite pretty really) and beneath it a number: 84 on
        Jessica and 69 on Kate. It was something she always thought was amusing.  
      &#147;Are you sure these are permanent?&#148; He asked them as
        they maintained their bent-over position. He felt duty-bound to verify
        that the colourful tattoo couldn&#146;t be rubbed off. His finger rubbed
        vigorously on the tattoo inevitably coming into vigorous contact with
        Jessica&#146;s labia. He was satisfied with the tattoo&#146;s permanence.  
      &#147;Don&#146;t you need to check mine too?&#148; Kate asked,
        feeling she may have missed out. The camera flashed four times: A full
        view of their rear ends and a close-up of the bunny tattoo with, unavoidably,
        their labia in the same shot. 
      &#147;Very nice. Very nice indeed,&#148; the flustered police chief
        commented, leaving the bunnies to ponder whether he referred to the tattoos
        or their asses. &#147;You can stand up again now.&#148; 
      The police chief left them alone in the room, he was off to the
        dark room, to develop the photo&#146;s of course! Jessica and Kate sat
        on the wooden bench, waiting in silence, whilst adjusting to their new
        form of bondage.  
      They were mildly amused by the sight of their hands poking through
        the top of the wooden stocks. Jessica and Kate exchanged their repertoire
        of few rude hand gestures, lightening their mood considerably. It made
        a change not to have their hands pinned behind their backs, but what
        Jessica hated was the way the wood protruded two inches ahead of her
        chin, preventing her from looking down at her body unless she bent forward.
        It felt like her head and hands were somehow detached from her body -
        an unsettling feeling. It seemed to say that her body was reserved for
        somebody else. She was surprised that Rabbit Island hadn&#146;t thought
        of using these stocks. 
      &#147;Jesus, I sure hope Rabbit Island doesn&#146;t start making
        us wear these things!&#148; Kate said, pointlessly struggling against
        the sturdy wooden device as if she were a female Houdini. 
      &#147;But we&#146;re not going back there.&#148; Jessica reminded
        her. &#147;The police chief said as soon as we receive our ten lashes
        we&#146;ll be set free.&#148; 
      The door opened. Jessica and Kate stood up instinctively, expecting
        to be led out to receive their whipping. Instead, Abdi their arresting
        officer, brought two other women into the room. They were dressed in
        the same modest clothing and head coverings as the other womenfolk in
        the town. The policeman ordered them to strip naked, and it became apparent
        that one of them could only be in her mid-teens. No longer a child, yet
        not quite a woman either judging by the modest development of her breasts.
        She submitted tearfully as the policemen fitted her into the same wrist
        and neck stocks as Jessica and Kate wore. 
      The other native was very different, she was a mature woman, perhaps
        30 years of age, an exotic brown-skinned beauty, with a fine cheek-bones
        and dark fiery eyes beneath shapely eyebrows. Despite the defiant look
        in her eyes she submitted to her locking stocks as if it were a familiar
        routine. That was when Jessica noticed the ominous darkened scarring
        of skin on her back. 
      The four women waited in silence, eyeing up each other; the locals
        on one bench, Jessica and Kate facing them on the other. Jessica wondered
        what crime the innocent-looking schoolgirl could possibly have committed
        to get into this predicament. The older woman, Jessica had already concluded,
        must be a prostitute. 
      A bell rung outside the room. The policeman opened the door, led
        the four punishees through the bare concrete hallways of the police HQ
        until they entered another room. It was a long room with a black curtain
        running fully along one side. On the other side, bolted into the wall,
        was a frame, the purpose of which soon became apparent. The four naked
        women were lined up, whether accidentally or by design, in order of height:
        Jessica, the prostitute, Kate and the young girl.  
      As Jessica was pushed towards the wall her stocks fitted precisely
        into slots on either side of her. A couple of retaining pins were inserted,
        maintaining her in her standing position. Next, somebody forced her to
        spread her legs slightly, her ankles were pushed into semicircular cutouts
        in the bottom of the wooden frame and fixed with the corresponding rear
        portion of the wooden stock. The disturbing effect of spreading her legs
        was that Jessica&#146;s height was reduced, leaving her chin leaning
        heavily on the wooden stocks to compensate. All she could do was stare
        straight ahead at the grey breeze-block wall a few inches from her nose. 
      Whether the exploring fingers of a policeman was an official part
      the treatment Jessica could only guess. His gentle but intrusive finger
      manipulated her cunt, teasing her clitoris with surprising tenderness.
      He soon had the desired effect. There was nothing she could do, either
      to defend herself or prevent her own arousal. Having achieved their apparent
      objective his fingers then forced themselves into Jessica&#146;s mouth
      until she&#146;d involuntarily licked her own juices. The man laughed,
      mocking her weakness. It wasn&#146;t a voice that Jessica had heard before.
      He was the executioner, although it was a quiet day today, only four women
      to be whipped. 
       
      An inimitable rubbery smell proceeded a lump of rubber being forced
      into Jessica&#146;s mouth. It wasn&#146;t strapped in place and would be
      easy for her to expel it; which made Jessica think that maybe she should
      leave it where it was. She closed her eyes, bit down into the rubber and
      listened to the other punishees being secured and subjected to the same
      finger treatment. It became quiet when they too accepted the rubber gags. 
       
      The curtain behind the four restrained bodies opened. They couldn&#146;t
        turn to see it but could feel the gentle breeze of the open air and hear
        the low conversation of a small crowd. The whipping ceremony was a public
        performance. A voice from the stage addressed the gathered &#145;witnesses&#146; to
        explain the crimes and punishments. About two dozen men and women from
        the town watched and listened intently as the police chief read out the
        details: 
      1) Decadent American woman parading naked and unkempt, and without official
      papers: 10 lashes and deportation 
      2) Local woman persisting in her belief of atheistic ideas: 10 lashes and
      return to prison 
      3) Decadent English woman parading naked and unkempt, and without official
      papers: 10 lashes and deportation 
      4) Local schoolgirl kissing another female in the street: 3 lashes and
      one month house arrest. 
       
      Without warning, the first lash from the executioner landed in
        the middle of Jessica&#146;s back, pain ripping through her like an electric
        shock. For a moment she blacked out before re-orienting herself, grateful
        that the rubber in her mouth was protecting her teeth and tongue. 
      The crack of the whip on the back of the local woman was so palpable
        that Jessica thought she&#146;d been struck again! The woman was grunting
        and panting, fighting her own battle against the pain. 
      Kate was next. She heard the whoosh of the whip a moment before
        it struck, like a shotgun. The blow was hard, cruel even! Rabbit Island
        was never like that. She&#146;d been known to enjoy the taste of a whip,
        but this wasn&#146;t a turn-on for her, just pain and misery.  
      The trembling teenager received the fourth stroke, and expelled
        the most pitiable cry. The executioner and the &#145;witnesses&#146;,
        although they would never admit it, greatly enjoyed that moment when
        all the penitents had received their first cut of the whip. A delicious
        ensemble of squirming, panting and crying bodies each recovering from
        the last stroke while awaiting fearfully for their next one. 
      Once the teenager had received her strokes she was left in position
        to experience the pain of her fellow sufferers until they too had received
        all theirs. It taught her that any future punishments would be worse.
        Perhaps the executioner felt that Jessica and Kate were bearing up too
        well, despite the welts and small cuts. He made sure that the final stroke
        was the worst, leaving Jessica, the prostitute, and Kate limp and broken.
        The immovable wooden stocks holding their wrists and neck were all that
        kept them standing. 
      The &#145;witnesses&#146; gave no audible appreciation of the executioner&#146;s
        performance. After all, it was a punishment, public viewing was permitted
        only as a salutary reminder to citizens to obey the law. Exactly why
        some of those citizens, men and women equally, felt the need to be reminded
        of the law twice every week, can only be guessed at. 
      The curtain was drawn again and the punished women were released
        from the frame. Unsteady on their feet, they were led back to the waiting
        room. All except the schoolgirl were heavily welted, with blood trickling
        from various cuts. The teenage girl was the first to be released from
        her stocks and still sobbing, she dressed herself in her modest clothes.
        The &#145;prostitute&#146; dressed too, except that she was handcuffed
        before being removed back to her prison cell. Jessica felt quite sorry
        for the poor woman. 
      &#147;Goodbye&#148; she said to Jessica as she was led from the
        waiting room. Jessica was shocked - did she speak English or did she
        just know a few words? Jessica asked the police chief about the woman
        as he was refixing their familiar cuffs on them. 
      &#147;Lina. The crazy woman?&#148; He shook his head, as if to
        indicate what a lost cause she was. &#147;She used to be a teacher until
        her husband died. Then she became fixated with atheism. Our society does
        not want such mad thoughts corrupting our youth, so she was sent to prison.
        She still has two years of her jail sentence. Every week she visits us
        for her ten lashes, although personally, I don&#146;t think it has cured
        her.&#148; 
      Miguel the fisherman arrived at the police station, just as Jessica
        and Kate were about to embark on a hazardous conversation about religion
        and atheism. 
      &#147;Okay madams, your transport is here to take you back to the
        island,&#148; the Police Cchief announced. 
      &#147;Back to the island?&#148; They replied together, jaws dropping
        in utter disbelief. 
      &#147;Of course! You&#146;ve been extradited back to your country
        of origin. Please dress modestly and have the relevant documentation
        before you return to see us again.&#148; 
      Kate and Jessica were glum-faced, but it was about to get worse.
        Miguel wasn&#146;t happy to learn he had been responsible for bringing
        two stowaways to the port. If they had gotten away, no-one would have
        known that his boat had been used, but they&#146;d been caught and that
        meant he was in trouble.  
      Just by chance he&#146;d paid a visit to the steel fabricator hours
        earlier and collected the latest order. He brought two brand new cages
        into the room. Small, but large enough for an average woman if you know
        how to put her in correctly. 
      The instructions were simple: First, open the lid and make
      her kneel in the cage. Attach the built-in manacles to her ankles. Push
      her chest down onto her thighs and attach the retaining chain from the
      base of the cage to the front of her collar. Finally, close the cage, making
      sure to attach her handcuffs to the retaining clip on the lid. Make certain
      that the cage is secured with two high-strength steel padlocks.  
       
      They returned to the fishing boat by the same pickup truck that brought
      them to the police station four hours previously, only this time they were
      caged.  
       
      The police chief accompanied them back to the boat. He shook hands
        with the Miguel the fisherman once all the goods were aboard. &#147;Tell
        your bosses that whilst we appreciate the benefits they bring to our
        economy we do not want their morals to infect the citizens of our country.&#148;  
      He helped cast off the mooring ropes and watched the boat navigate
        slowly out of the harbour, waving to Jessica and Kate. They were glaring
        angrily out of their cages back at him. 
      
         *** 
       
      Jessica and Kate&#146;s cages were placed next to each other on
        the deck of the fishing boat, surrounded by boxes of general supplies
        - canned food, building material, janitorial supplies and even some live
        chickens. It wasn&#146;t the first time they&#146;d been in such cages,
        but it was unusual to be left without a gag. Jessica was pointlessly
        tugging at her chains refusing to accept that she&#146;d been defeated.
        She despised herself for getting her friend into this mess. It was Kate&#146;s
        turn to provide the encouragement. 
      &#147;Cheer up Jessi. At least we had a day out! Although I felt
        we could have used a little more time to take in the sights and do some
        shopping!&#148; 
      Jessica gave a sardonic laugh. &#147;I&#146;m glad you can see
        the funny side, but I&#146;m not sure The Lodge will feel the same way.
        You know we&#146;re going to be punished, don&#146;t you? They might
        even decide to sell us.&#148; 
      That wasn&#146;t something Kate had contemplated. She, or at least
        her body, was liked and enjoyed by staff and visitors alike, surely they
        wouldn&#146;t dispose of her! &#147;Well, what if we apologize?&#148; 
      &#147;Oh Katie. You are wonderful! If you want to apologize to
        them, please do so... but I just couldn&#146;t. I would rather they disposed
        of me to some fucking Arab than be defeated by them.&#148; 
      &#147;Hey, that&#146;s a bit racist, Jessi!&#148; 
      &#147;Hah! Wasn&#146;t it your Arab boyfriend in Kuwait that sold
        you into slavery?&#148; 
      &#147;Well...yes, I suppose so, but they&#146;re not all bad. You
        were kidnapped by Americans, your fellow countrymen, so they aren&#146;t
        exactly the good guys!&#148; 
      The Rabbit Island harbour, or rather its primitive jetty in a sheltered
        inlet, came into view, curtailing the bunnies&#146; increasingly irritable
        exchanges. They were tired and hungry, and almost glad to be back on
        Rabbit Island again, and even started to think about what was for supper. 
      The shoreline in the distance seemed alive with activity. Up to
        a dozen people were waiting for them...that&#146;s if you count the ponygirls.
        Two pairs of harnessed ponygirls were standing and waiting, each attached
        in front of their usual single axle traps, and on this occasion their
        lightweight trailers. Today they had some extra cargo to haul back to
        The Lodge.

      Chapter 2. Back to the Cells 
      (Even Ponygirls Sometimes Get the Blues, Aurelius) 
     
     
     
    The welcoming party greeting the fishing boat at the dock wasn&#146;t
      what Jessica wanted to see, though they seemed more amused than angry about
      their bunnies&#146; audacious escape attempt. 
    As soon as the boat had docked the handlers went aboard to retrieve the
      cages containing Jessica and Kate. Two men, one lifting each side of the
      cage, easily carried them from the boat, along the jetty, onto the shore,
      and straight onto the flat beds of the pony trailers. One cage was placed
      on each trailer. 
    &#147;Gags!&#148; One of the men said. &#147;Better gag &#145;em before
      they get in more trouble.&#148; 
    He rummaged around in one of the accompanying boxes of supplies. &#147;Here
      they are, brand new gags. Mmm..Mmm! Smell that fresh rubber and leather!&#148; He
      lifted up the shiny red ball-gag by its neat black leather strap and tossed
      it to his colleague standing next to Kate&#146;s cage. 
    The handler reached a hand into the front of Jessica&#146;s cage, and
      resigned to her fate, she opened her mouth as wide as she could. He still
      had to push hard to get the ball behind her teeth. &#147;There we are Jessica...
      all buckled up with a nice big ball. Boy, that gag looks good on you!&#148; 
    She&#146;d heard that compliment before. Apparently it was the way her
      lips were stretched back exposing her pearly-white teeth, biting into the
      red rubber. 
    Another man approached Jessica&#146;s cage. He wore his usual crooked
      and gleeful smile. &#147;Welcome back, bunny Jessica! Did you have nice
      day at the port?&#148; It was Master Kurt, one of the senior handlers,
      renowned for his Teutonic sense of humor and devious tortures (although
      some argued these were the same thing!) 
    Jessica shook her head as much as her chained collar would allow, making
      an angry and incomprehensible sound behind her gag. In truth, she didn&#146;t
      have a reply to such cruel sarcasm so the ball-gag spared her the task
      of delivering a worthy response. She glared back at him from behind the
      bars of her small cage... if looks could kill! 
    Master Kurt smiled wickedly. &#147;Oh come on Jessica, cheer up! At least
      you had a little adventure... met some of the natives... participated in
      their quaint local customs... had so much fun you nearly missed the last
      boat back!... How are the new cages? Comfortable? Looks quite cosy in there.&#148; 
    Chained and locked within a cage no bigger than her own crouched form?
      Yes, it was cosy. Even cosier by the time they packed the area around Jessica&#146;s
      cage with cases of canned goods and janitorial supplies! 
    With a jolt and a lurching motion the small ponygirl trailer started to
      move. The pair of ponygirls ahead of each trailer, naked except for their
      sturdy working harnesses, strained hard to heave their cargo into motion.
      Their driver, sat on the small bench seat between the ponies and the cargo,
      tugged again on their reins, his whip ready to deliver the necessary incentive. 
    Leaning forward to get more power from their muscular thighs, the ponygirls
      soon made a strong synchronized walking stride, the most that could be
      expected of them when pulling a heavy load up the hill. 
    The track levelled and the ponygirls managed a slow trot with encouragement
      from the driver&#146;s whip. Just a well-aimed sting of the whip on each
      of their buttocks was sufficient. It was more of a command than a punishment
      - one that they instinctively responded to. The sound of the trailers&#146; mountain-bike
      wheels rolling along the gravel path and the bells on the pony boots provided
      the soundtrack to Jessica&#146;s inglorious journey to the Lodge. 
    THE CELLS 
    Jessica was delivered straight to the cell-block and into solitary. A
      place with no windows, and where natural light did not enter. The door
      to her cell slammed closed, the bolt thrown and the key turned in the heavy
      lock. High-security at any time, even more so when she was still locked
      within her small cage in the middle of the cell floor. 
    It had been twenty four hours since she last ate, and Jessica was close
      to fainting. Her back, with its ten wounding stripes, was still tingling
      with pain. She could do nothing about either, except wait and hope somebody
      would show her mercy before the inevitable punishments started. 
    Some time later the clattering of the key in the lock woke up her up from
      a light snooze. A man entered. It was Master Alex, General Manager of The
      Lodge and principal tormentor of Jessica&#146;s soul. 
    Master Alex was twice her age, hair graying and receded, with steely gray
      eyes and a lean, chiseled frame. Handsome in his way, but more than that
      he exuded an intellectual and emotional self-confidence. People respected
      and admired him. Yes, even Jessica, despite herself. 
    Jessica held her head downwards, not wishing to face him. It would have
      been so easy for Master Alex to make a few cheap jibes at her expense in
      the same way that Kurt had done earlier. Too easy, Alex thought, hence
      no sport at all. 
    &#147;Jessica,&#148; he called her name softly, expecting to see her handsome
      face and her usual fiery defiant scowl. 
    She raised her head slowly and peered out of her cage at him, revealing
      her splendid ball-gagged mouth, a tired furrowed brow and dark eyes pleaded
      with him. For this day at least she knew she had lost. 
    &#147;Have you eaten today?&#148; He asked. 
    She shook her head meekly. 
    &#147;Okay, I&#146;ll take care of it.&#148; He said. How the tormentor
      of her soul could surprise her! Sometimes cruel, yet often sensitive to
      her needs. He walked out of the cell and moments later came back with Erik,
      the sub-Master for the Lodge and an expert in &#145;slave care&#146;. 
    &#147;Should we leave her in the cage?&#148; Master Alex asked him; as
      willing as ever to defer to the judgement of others when appropriate. 
    Erik studied Jessica&#146;s face; sensing her fatigue and hunger. He also
      noticed the deep welts on her back. She&#146;d really taken a beating at
      the port. &#147;No, let&#146;s get her out of there. We&#146;d best get
      the wounds treated before we do anything else. Where are the keys?&#148; 
    Master Alex shrugged. &#147;New cages and new high security locks. There
      should be a set of keys with the other goods.&#148; 
    They left Jessica alone and went in search of keys. Food too, she hoped
      and prayed. 
    Erik returned first, carrying a plate of something steaming. &#147;No
      keys,&#148; he informed her, clearly disappointed. &#147;Seems that Miguel
      left them in the police station when you were put in the cage. You&#146;re
      gonna have to spend the night in there. We&#146;re not going to hack away
      at a brand new cage.&#148; 
    The cruel irony was lost on Jessica, that Miguel&#146;s forgetfulness
      with keys, having enabled them to stow away on his fishing boat, was now
      the cause of her spending the night in the cramped cage! 
    Erik reached into the cage and unbuckled Jessica&#146;s gag, and prised
      the large rubber ball from behind her teeth. 
    &#147;Eat!&#148; Erik said, poking a spoonful of vegetable casserole through
      the bars of the cage. Jessica hardly needed encouragement, she gratefully
      accepted it and the other spoonfuls that followed. 
    When the food was finished Erik slapped a general purpose healing salve
      to Jessica&#146;s back, reaching through the bars of the cage as best he
      could. He warned it might sting, and it did. Jessica winced in pain as
      Erik&#146;s fingers expertly worked the lotion into her skin. With her
      hands chained behind her and linked to the top of the cage Jessica was
      not in a position to resist.  
    Erik didn&#146;t need much time to complete the job and there was little
      incentive for him to spend time in the company of a woman chained inside
      a small cage. For someone in Erik&#146;s position there were far more appealing
      sights in store. 
    To Jessica&#146;s dismay he was intent on replacing her ball-gag. 
    &#147;Erik! Do you have to?&#148; she pleaded, as he pressed the red ball
      to her lips. 
    &#147;You&#146;re forgetting your place Jessica... now open up.&#148; Jessica
      knew not to bite the hand that feeds her, nor to refuse his gag afterwards. 
    Once gagged, Jessica became stoically resigned to her long, miserable,
      lonely, jaw-aching night ahead. But she&#146;d suffered worse in the past
      and knew she would do so again in the coming few days. 
    Erik left, locking the solid cell door behind him. Moments later Jessica
      was plunged into pitch-black darkness. The floor of her cage was well padded,
      so Jessica&#146;s knees and shins were well cushioned. That was the defining
      feature of the cage - not the pain but simply the torment caused by her
      immobility. A long-term cage. Jessica shuffled around with the inches she
      had available looking for any small improvement in her comfort. 
    THE PENDULUM 
    Jessica&#146;s first torment of the next morning was The Pendulum .
      Her torture-master for the day: Master Kurt and his cruel smile. 
    She was naked, and had been suspended belly down by chains coming from
      a single point on the ceiling. Her weight was taken by sturdy leather cuffs
      on her wrist and ankles. A thick belt around her waist was connected by
      a chain to the ceiling so that her torso stayed parallel to the floor,
      dangling just a few inches above it. Layers of wide white surgical tape
      were plastered across the lower half of her face. Attached to the front
      and back of the belt was a tight crotch rope, nestled between her labia
      and the crack of her buttocks. 
    Like all Rabbit Island bunnies, Jessica had been in suspension bondage
      before; this didn&#146;t seem so bad, particularly with the belt around
      her waist taking the weight. However, Master Kurt had a new format to try
      and Jessica was its first test subject. 
    Master Kurt turned his attention to a tray full of tea-warmer candles...
      dozens of them. Jessica looked on in fascination as he carefully lit each
      candle in turn with a taper. It looked quite pretty, that tray full of
      flickering flames, almost like a rectangular birthday cake.  
    He slid the tray along the floor and under Jessica&#146;s belly. Although
      several inches above the flames, Jessica panicked as she felt the warmth
      turning into a burning heat from her breasts to top of her thighs. She
      jogged and jolted herself desperately trying avoid the heat and pleaded
      with Kurt behind her taped-up mouth. 
    Kurt stood back and waited a few moments more and enjoyed Jessica&#146;s
      panic, knowing that her nervous system was sending her brain messages of
      intense burning pain, even though she was unlikely to be burnt for another
      thirty seconds or so. 
    He knelt down, cupped her face in his hands and stroked her hair, as if
      to comfort her; savouring Jessica&#146;s final agonizing moments before
      firmly pushing her head away from him, and away from the heat of the candles.
      She started to swing like a pendulum. The relief was instant, and as Jessica
      swung back and forth over the tray of candles she realized how she would
      be spending the next hour.  
    Kurt stood up, crossed his arms and inspected Jessica&#146;s swing. It
      wasn&#146;t easy, but if she timed a tug of her shoulders on the back-swing
      she would maintain her momentum and avoid dangling motionless over the
      heat of the candles. 
    &#147;So you see Jessica, that&#146;s all you have to do - keep swinging.&#148; To
      her horror, he grabbed the ropes above her and stilled her back over the
      candles. &#147;Now let&#146;s see if you can get started without my help.&#148; 
    He watched, greatly amused by Jessica&#146;s frantic squealing as she
      tried to jog herself into motion. Eventually she succeeded and worked diligently
      to maintain a swinging arc of several feet. Kurt left her gently swinging
      in the cell and strolled off to his next appointment. 
    Once Jessica perfected her technique it became easy to act as a human
      pendulum. But it was having a side effect - that crotch rope was digging
      and rubbing into her moist crease with every swing. 
    KATE&#146;S DEPILATION 
    Meanwhile, Kate was in the next cell receiving special treatment of her
      own. She was suspended under a wide spreader bar, left wrist and ankle
      to one end, right wrist and ankle to the other.  
    Her labia was open, hanging down like a luscious fruit, five feet from
      the ground. A perfect position for receiving all manner of attentions for
      Kurt. His first job was to remove her pubic hair, a particularly enjoyable
      task in his opinion. A safety razor might be useful for dealing with stubble,
      but for that initial removal of the bush, wax was his preferred method.
      Hanging doubled-up and wide open as she was, Kate had a good view of Kurt&#146;s
      handiwork. 
    &#147;Ever been waxed before, kate?&#148; Kurt asked as he firmly pressed
      a series of wax strips onto her mound. 
    &#147;Not like this,&#148; she said with a slow shake of her head. 
    &#147;Good. I shall enjoy it even more! It's like losing your virginity,
      except much more painful... but the result is worth it. I&#146;m going
      to let the wax dry a little to make sure it&#146;s ready.&#148; 
    Master Kurt left Kate to contemplate her impending hair removal - he had
      to go see how his human pendulum was performing. By coincidence Master
      Alex had also just arrived in Jessica&#146;s cell and was admiring the
      scene. Jessica was swinging with an accomplished economy of effort, aquick
      learner. The candles gently warming her as she passed back and forth over
      them. 
    Master Alex had a delighted grin on his face. &#147;Bravo Kurt! Superb
      idea.&#148; He said, giving his German colleague a congratulatory pat on
      the shoulder. 
    &#147;And how is it for you, Jessica?&#148; 
&#147;Mmmmppphhh!&#148;, she replied with angry shake of her head that disrupted
her rhythm. 
     
&#147;Yes, I thought you might say that,&#148; he chuckled. 
     
    &#147;Kurt. Could we set this thing up in the lobby for the tomorrow&#146;s
      cocktail party?&#148; Alex asked, always looking for new ways to enhance
      the evening entertainments. 
    &#147;No problem! I have some extra modifications in mind to make Jessica
      more useful. If we rigged up our pendulum correctly I think she could provide
      the power for several ceiling fans.&#148; Kurt led Master Alex from the
      cell, and to Jessica&#146;s surprise he left the door open; not that she
      could contemplate an escape from her current position. 
    Master Kurt switched his attention to Kate in the next cell. She hung
      helplessly in her bonds, becoming increasingly anxious as the wax dried
      tightly onto her pubic hair. He prodded her waxy mound with his fingertips,
      checking its softness, and whether it was ready for the big moment. 
    Her cell door was also left open. Clearly Kate&#146;s moment of pain was
      not intended to be a private one. 
    Kurt prised a fingernail under the first wax strip until he was able to
      grip it firmly between finger and thumb. Without warning he pulled hard.
      The sound of ripping hair was followed a moment later by Kate&#146;s terrifying
      scream. The sound of her anguish reverberated throughout the cell block
      and beyond, and into the Lodge itself. 
    Jessica, was still swinging calmly over the candles when Kate&#146;s scream
      seemed to rip through her. She&#146;d never heard such a horrific noise
      from her friend. In her own distress and remorse for feeling responsible
      for Kate&#146;s punishment, Jessica lost her swinging rhythm and found
      herself suspended motionless over the candles. As long as Kate&#146;s cries
      rung out Jessica couldn&#146;t concentrate on getting herself swinging.
      She started to feel the intense burning of the candles. 
    Kate&#146;s loud sobbing was punctuated by further cries that lessened
      in intensity as if she had simply run out of breath, as can happen to a
      small child. Master Kurt was very happy with Kate&#146;s denuded sex. Kate
      was regaining her composure as Master Kurt poured some after-shave lotion
      into his hand. &#147;My own blend,&#148; he explained proudly. 
    Poor Jessica had only just got back into her swing as Kurt rubbed his
      special solution deep into Kate&#146;s exposed follicles. Her screaming
      resumed. 
    It had been a good morning - Kurt thought to himself as he tidied up his
      tools. He lowered each of his tormented bunnies to the concrete floor but
      left them in their bonds as he closed and locked the two cell doors. It
      was time for lunch! 
    
       *** 
     
    Kate sat on the concrete floor of her cell, legs and arms outstretched
      by the long spreader bar. And now she wore a ball-gag, her &#145;lunch&#146; Kurt
      jokingly called it. She studied her still-smarting, denuded mound. It was
      so close, barely 12 inches from her face, yet she couldn&#146;t touch it
      despite the overwhelming urge to do so. She laughed to herself at the absurdity,
      her torture had merely been a waxing, albeit not the most gentle one. She
      had no idea of the distress her cries had caused Jessica in the neighbouring
      cell. 
    In the afternoon Kate found herself suspended by her spreader bar again.
      Her clean pussy dangling fully exposed, soft and fleshy like ripening fruit,
      and Kurt was keen to have his dessert! Kurt&#146;s fingers grabbed her
      thighs, fingers digging deeply into her straining muscles, and she felt
      it, a powerful and painful jolt. Kate mmppphhhed, looking wide-eyed at
      Master Kurt, asking what the hell he just did. 
    Master Kurt smiled cruelly. &#147;That&#146;s your hamstring, stretched
      nice and tight, tuned to D sharp I would guess.&#148; He pushed his thumbs
      viciously into both her thighs, enjoying Kate&#146;s convulsing pain that
      accompanied each press. 
    Kate was panting, trying to recover from the pain as Kurt&#146;s finger
      trailed admiringly over her labia, moving onto her clitoris. He liked her
      in this position, her pussy and face so close together. He liked to see
      her facial expression change as he worked on her sex. &#147;Would you like
      me to lick it for you?&#148; he asked. 
    She shook her head and grunted &#145;go to hell&#146; from behind her
      ball-gag. Defiant but ultimately helpless. Kurt continued his invasive
      actions, his tongue teasing and arousing her as he enjoyed his dessert.
      He noticed a glazed distant expression in her eyes. Enough for now, he
      thought, Jessica awaited him in the adjacent cell. She too would be the
      recipient of Kurt&#146;s widely acknowledged expertise in matters of erotic
      torture. 
    THE STANDING CAGE 
    The next day Jessica had an appointment with the &#145;standing cage&#146;.
      She had encountered this device before and didn&#146;t like it - not one
      bit! 
    It was like one of those medieval torture cages, but this was more devious
      than cruel. There seemed to be a million adjustments that could be made
      - little round-tipped probes that could be pushed against her flesh at
      known pressure points. Gradually as the hours passed, Jessica became immobile,
      standing within that human-shaped cage.  
    &#147;Those ancient Chinese were clever people you know, with their acupressure
      points,&#148; Kurt explained to the pretty blonde girl assisting him. &#147;We
      are still learning from charts that are more than a thousand years old.&#148; 
    Kurt continued fixing dozens more probes in position, the ones at Jessica's
      temples and a special one for her nose leaving her head held rigid so she
      could only blink in response as Kurt tightened the probes digging into
      her ribs and thighs. The blonde girl continued to assist him, appearing
      to have great fun poking Jessica&#146;s body. She was what they called
      a &#145;pussy girl&#146; at the Lodge, a submissive who had over a period
      of time become a willing participant in the deviant activities of the lodge. 
    Eventually, every possible part of Jessica&#146;s body with a nerve ending
      was being pushed with a probe. All that remained was for Kurt to plug in
      the random electro-shock unit and leave her alone for the next couple of
      hours. 
    TWO INTO ONE DOES GO! 
    Kate was hanging around in the neighboring cell, the strain showing on
      her face after hanging doubled-up from the spreader bar for the second
      day in a row. A couple of men arrived at the cell at 2pm, as arranged.
      They were Filipinos, two of many employed to look after the grounds and
      generally facilities. 
    &#147;Good afternoon, gentlemen.&#148; Kurt welcomed them heartily, trying
      to distract their staring eyes from Kate&#146;s body for just a few seconds. &#147;Did
      they explain what was required of you?&#148; 
    &#147;Yes, we think so.&#148; One of Filipinos responded. &#147;We fuck
      the girl two at a time while you film us. $500 each, $1000 if she cums.&#148; 
    &#147;Exactly! The cameras are already set up. Kate&#146;s ready, as you
      can see. Here are your masks to preserve your identity. Don&#146;t forget
      the lubricant and condoms. And if you want to see the film, just come and
      see me later this evening.&#148; 
    Master Kurt then approached the wide-eyed, panicking Kate, lowering her
      suspension chain to the correct height of his evenly matched visitors.
      He left to go to the Lodge&#146;s control room - a small room full of recording
      equipment and monitors, part security control center, part video mixing
      suite. Today he had a simple bespoke request to fulfill. One of Rabbit
      Island's senior members had paid for a video of a particular scene. 
    &#147;Such a pretty girl, this one.&#148; One Filipino said to the other. 
    &#147;Yeah. I always like this blonde slut. Now I get paid for going up
      her ass. You know, Jos&#233;, this is a very good job we have!&#148; 
    Kate trembled slightly as the man behind her started to caress her breasts.
      His hands were warm, and massaged her breasts with consideration, literally
      getting the feel of her. Although he was still clothed, his crotch pressed
      against her buttocks, as if checking for the correct height. She was perfectly
      positioned, and the feel of her taut spread open buttocks had instantly
      put him in the right mood. Both men stripped naked and donned their carnivale-style
      masks. 
    The rear guy went to work, lubing Kate&#146;s anus with his hand, a gentle
      push and two fingers were moving easily in and out of her sphincter. His
      penis replaced his fingers, and pressed smoothly up to its hilt into her
      rectum.  
    Kate liked anal sex. When that devious bastard Arab boyfriend sold her,
      he told the buyers everything about her sordid sex life. She&#146;d been
      taken by two men once before, and loved it! But that was as a free woman,
      just playing around on a wild evening; not as a prisoner, suspended in
      cuffs and chains! 
    As she felt herself impaled by the rigid penis in her anus, the strain
      of hanging by her wrist and ankles had eased as if lifted by the man&#146;s
      member. After some simple but effective foreplay from the front man, Kate
      was doubly impaled and the weight taken by her wrists and ankles vanished. 
    Kate had become the filling in a human sandwich, female flesh squeezed
      tightly between warm male flesh. She mewled complaisantly behind her ball-gag.
      The men acted cautiously, far gentler than she expected, obviously determined
      to try for the full $1000 dollars. Kate increasingly felt she would have
      trouble denying them that bonus as they started to thrust slowly within
      her, sometimes with alternate strokes, at other times with one combined
      thrust that made it seem like there was just one giant penis within her.
      As their pace increased Kate found herself bouncing up and down like a
      contorted, powerless rag-doll. 
    She couldn&#146;t hold out any longer and released herself to their insistent
      thrusting. It wasn&#146;t as if she had to pay the bonuses! - she
      thought, as her body pulsated and trembled. Those guttural gurgling sounds
      she made from behind that larger rubber ball-gag would surely provide the
      evidence the Filipinos needed for their bonuses! 
    BEDTIME 
    The beds in the cells were made up - fresh clean sheets, a plump pillow
      and a neatly tucked-in fluffy blanket. Alongside the oh-so-soft and pristine
      bed stood Kate, naked and leaning forward against the wall, hands chained
      up high above her head. Jessica was fixed likewise in an adjacent cell.
      This was another of Kurt&#146;s innovations: Fix up the bunny so she spends
      the whole night standing in chains next to the softest, most inviting bed
      she could ever imagine. 
    THE COMMITTEE DECIDES 
    Several days later the sentencing committee met in the Lodge&#146;s boardroom.
      There was only one thing on the agenda...Jessica! 
    &#147;Ladies and Gentlemen, we must face the facts, bunny jessica has
      shown little sign of her purported submissive tendencies.&#148; The man
      was making reference to Rabbit Island&#146;s policy of only acquiring those
      with proven submissive traits. &#147;Somebody got it wrong. It&#146;s unfortunate,
      but it happens sometimes.&#148; 
    He looked down at his typed-up notes. &#147;A few months ago she kicked
      a man so hard that the poor gentleman needed surgery on his testicles.
      She has also attempted to bribe her way off the island. Finally she attempted,
      and very nearly succeeded, to escape from this island using our own transport.
      I vote we grant her wish to leave the Island and put her up for auction
      immediately.&#148; The man&#146;s comments met with mumbles of agreement
      from others around the table. 
&#147;I must disagree,&#148; Master Alex said with a passion that surprised the
others. &#147;Jessica has a strong personality, she is a physical person, fit
and strong, and yet I maintain, basically submissive. She longs to be dominated,
but not by weak men, or even brutal men, but by irresistible physical, psychological
and emotional power... 
     
&#147;If we can instill the correct motivation in her she would make a fine addition
to our depleted stables.&#148; He cast his steely-gray eyes around the table,
ready it seemed to carry on with Jessica's &#145;defence&#146; as necessary. 
     
    &#147;Very well,&#148; the chairman conceded. &#147;But why don&#146;t
      we give Jessica the choice? Become a ponygirl, or get shipped out. She
      can decide for herself.&#148; 
    The meeting concluded. Master Alex walked to the cellblock to present
      Jessica with her limited options. 
    
       *** 
     
    &#147;Never!&#148; she yelled at him. 
    &#147;Jessica. Do you know what could be your fate if you went up for
      auction? I do, and believe me, you are better off on Rabbit Island.&#148; Master
      Alex was growing tired of trying to convince her. 
    &#147;You are asking me to willingly agree to be turned into a pony! How
      can I make the choice to subjugate myself like that. I&#146;d rather spend
      my life chained up in a cell!&#148; Jessica stared at him defiantly. She
      was stood against the wall, arms chained wide and high as they had been
      for several hours. A silken sheen of perspiration reflected from her straining
      muscles of her finely toned arms. Master Alex admired that very much. 
    He was concerned that he was about to lose this battle. Lose what? The
      argument or Jessica? He decided to say something he never had before. &#147;What
      if I promised that if you stayed on the Island you would be free in two
      years?&#148; 
    &#147;Two years? But that&#146;s a lifetime!&#148; 
    He shook his head then made sure Jessica&#146;s eyes met his. &#147;No
      jessica, two years is two years, a lifetime is a lifetime, and I don&#146;t
      know how long that lifetime would be if you were sent elsewhere. That is
      your other option. You have...&#148; he glanced at his watch &#147;...forty
      two hours to decide.&#148; 
    BOUND MEDITATION 
    The Lodge had a special place for those who needed time to think. Jessica,
      cuffed and blindfolded, was led through various hallways of the Lodge to
      a room. She didn&#146;t know where, nor indeed would it matter where it
      was, there was nothing for her to see. 
    Jessica was glad to be back in Erik&#146;s hands. He was a firm handler
      but not cruel, and although she would never admit it, she responded to
      him. Perhaps because he was fair. 
    &#147;Sit!&#148; Erik instructed her. Jessica sat down onto a two foot
      high platform. It had a cool and smooth wooden surface, according to the
      feel of her hands and naked buttocks. 
    Erik manhandled Jessica&#146;s legs so she sat with her ankles crossed
      over and her knees spread wide. The crossed ankles were slotted into a
      rigid metal restraint fixed to front of the platform. Her hands were uncuffed,
      but only to be fitted into this same device, palms down, fingers forward,
      wrists on top of her ankles. 
    Jessica thought it seemed a comfortable position almost like meditating
      although her wrists and ankles were held utterly immobile by the device.
      Her wriggling, exploring fingers were soon dealt with by a roll of surgical
      tape that Erik wrapped around each hand to hold it in a fist.  
    Next came the ball-gag with a full head harness. Jessica could feel Erik&#146;s
      hands tightly buckling up the straps trailing up and over her head and
      under her chin. He had a strong but sensitive touch. 
    &#147;Jessica. Listen to me carefully.&#148; She was surprised to hear
      the distinctive measured tones of Master Alex. How cruel that his cultured
      New York accent tormented her with a reminder of home! She always noticed
      it more when she was blindfolded. &#147;Erik will plug your ears in a few
      moments time. Then you will be hooded... 
&#147;You will neither see, hear, or feel anything for the next eight hours.
Then your gag will be removed for ten minutes, during which time somebody will
feed you. If you have made your decision whether to stay or go you must let him
know in that time. Otherwise you will be gagged and hooded for another eight
hours. If you need to go to the bathroom, you can go right where you are. You
are sitting over a small hole, so you won&#146;t get messy. Good luck Jessica.&#148; He
made it sound like she was going on an adventure. 
     
    The ear-plugs were inserted. It felt weird. Of all the things she had done
    in her life, she had never worn ear-plugs. She could feel the spongy material
    almost screwed deep within her earholes. Her world didn&#146;t go totally
    silent, she could her her own body, her blood pulsing anxiously through her
    brain. 
     
    The hood was next - a black loose-fitting leather hood. She could feel
      Erik smoothing it down over her head then drawing it together around her
      neck. She felt a large padlock beneath her chin locking the hood around
      her neck, and could feel the cold heavy metal laying against her skin.
      That was all she could feel. 
    Erik said at his desk, with Jessica secured and silent on the platform
      behind him just a few feet away. It was a wonderful idea of his to put
      the platform in the office! Sometimes there would be three or four women
      sat in a row, each deprived of all senses, not even aware of the presence
      of others beside her. 
    Over the next few hours he watched Jessica from just a couple of feet
      away, while she sat in her enforced meditation, oblivious to his presence.
      He never touched her, although the pair of full and shapely breasts, crowned
      by those wonderful large nipples seemed to be calling out to him, slowly
      rising and falling as she breathed. 
    The first few hours weren&#146;t so bad for Jessica; actually it was quite
      peaceful. For the first time in several days she wasn&#146;t being whipped
      or burned or clamped or pierced! The aching of her buttocks on the polished
      wooden platform was soon replaced by a dull numbness that she couldn&#146;t
      alleviate. 
    Why did they think this treatment would make her want to be a ponygirl?
      She would still rather take her chance of being sold to another bunny camp.
      Bunny camps? How little did she know what kind of place she would be sent
      to! Do these other places even call them bunnies? 
    Jessica found that the first eight hours was up when she felt the padlock
      at her neck moving. The leather hood was lifted off. How wonderful it felt
      when she could feel somebody&#146;s fingers unbuckling the straps of her
      head harness! Those fingers were soon between her lips pulling out that
      rubber ball. Her blindfold remained in place. 
    &#147;Thank you!&#148; she said to the hands that had released her. How
      strange her voice sounded with her ears bunged up, as if she were at the
      bottom of the ocean. There was no response, not that she would hear it
      anyway. She felt something wooden at her lips. It was a wooden spoon carrying
      food; warm and tasty. She ate like a hungry nestling, her mouth wide open
      waiting eagerly for the next mouthful. 
    &#147;Thank you!&#148; she said again to her captor, this time for feeding
      her. A few minutes later it was not the spoon but the rubber ball-gag being
      pressed against her lips. Jessica readily opened her mouth to receive it,
      as if to say &#145;I&#146;m not defeated&#146;. She felt those hands again;
      definitely Erik&#146;s, she thought; buckling her into that tight head
      harness. She was hooded, and the heavy padlock fastened again at the front
      of her neck.  
    Jessica felt she&#146;d coped well with the first eight hours, but that
      was another trick - it had only been six hours. If she felt that the next
      two sessions of her sensory deprivation felt longer, she would be right,
      each was an hour longer. 
    Erik played Freecell on his computer, listening contentedly and with some
      amusement to Jessica&#146;s random moans and occasional struggles as she
      sought but failed to change her position, not even by a fraction. 
    At the third feeding break Jessica hungrily ate everything that wonderful
      wooden spoon offered her, but afterwards was not so keen to accept her
      gag. &#147;Five more minutes,&#148; she pleaded to her anonymous warder,
      but the rubber ball was insistent, it wanted to get back in her mouth.
      Those fingers (&#147;definitely not Erik&#146;s&#148;, she though), why
      couldn&#146;t they touch her properly? Stroke her hair? Touch her ears?
      Treat her like a human being? She leaned her blindfolded head towards the
      fingers, desperate for some kind on human contact. Even to be slapped would
      be something - to feel pain, to sense an emotion; but she was denied even
      that. 
    Somebody decided that Kate would have a session on the platform before
      being released back to the bunny camp. Kurt delivered her, blindfolded
      of course, to Erik&#146;s office. He fixed her up in the same way as Jessica
      - ankles crossed, wrists on top of them. The gag, the earplugs and the
      hood followed.  
    Jessica&#146;s ability to distinguish between her imagination and reality
      had long since diminished, yet in her silent darkness she felt something
      strangely comforting - a presence. She found herself thinking of Kate. 
    KATE RELEASED 
    Eight hours of silence and darkness later Kate was removed from the platform.
      It was late afternoon when she was to be sent back to the bunny camp. Erik
      took her to the appropriately-named &#145;Releasing room&#146;. This was
      the place where bunnies would be prepared, then released from.  
    She was fitted back into her old handcuffs, chain and collar set. After
      the trials of the last few days in the cells the familiar roundness of
      the steel bracelets was actually comforting. She became excited about getting
      back to the cabin and telling her adventurous tale to the other bunnies. 
    They had something else for Kate. Something to dissuade her from straying
      in future: Leg-irons for her ankles, with a 12&#148; chain between them.
      Erik carefully secured the rounded steel manacles on her slim ankles making
      sure they were tight enough not to rub the skin as she walked. 
    Immediately before kicking the bunny out the door the Lodge had one more
      tradition - ten strokes of the paddle on her behind. Kate was bent over
      an wooden A-frame, all chained up and ready to receive her parting gift.
      She swallowed hard and waited. 
    The wooden paddle landed hard on her buttocks, sending a reverberating warm
    sting right rippling through her. Ten stinging strokes later she was deemed
    fit for release.  
     
    Suitably chastised, she was unceremoniously ushered out of the door, and
    left to make her own way back to the bunnies&#146; cabin. Kurt and Erik watched
    her from the window as Kate shuffled away from the Lodge coming to terms
    with her leg-irons, mumbling all kinds of curses at them under her breath.
    Just when she thought she was getting used to the chains she stumbled and
    fell awkwardly to the ground; luckily into some long grass. 
     
    Kate turned around to face the Lodge. &#147;You fucking bastards!&#148; she
      yelled at the building in the distance. 
    Erik and Kurt, looking out the small window, laughed heartily when they
      witnessed her fall. &#147;Very good, better get back to work,&#148; Erik
      said to his colleague. 
    DECISION TIME 
    Jessica&#146;s worst spell was to come after Kate was taken away. She
      had been sleeping lightly when suddenly she became wide awake. She felt
      her limbs being pulled hard in four different direction, fingernails like
      talons digging into her flesh of her wrist and ankles and drawing blood.
      Pulling so viciously as they tied her to a wooden table that her shoulders
      and hips were almost dislocating. A masked man was holding a large axe.
      He ran his finger over the blade and smiled as it drew his own blood. He
      swung the axe at her in a wide arc, Jessica watched it swing through the
      air and knew it was about to take her arm off. 
    She awoke with a jolt the moment the axe made contact. It had been a horrible
      nightmare, and left her shaking. Gradually she regained control of herself.
      She felt her mind rewinding like a video recorder until she remembered
      that she was sitting crouched on a wooden platform hands and ankles locked
      together. She could feel the undersides of her arms touching her soft and
      warm breasts, and she felt safe again. What stuck in Jessica&#146;s mind
      was that wherever this nightmare was taking place it wasn&#146;t Rabbit
      Island. She began to think it might be a premonition, and a thought occurred
      to her: &#145;This would never happen on Rabbit Island&#146;. 
    The next few hours passed quietly for Jessica, no nightmares, she even
      had moments of lucidity in her thoughts. After more than 24 hours sat hunched
      on the platform life had been reduced to a big rubber ball in her mouth,
      a heavy padlock at her neck, occasionally replaced by a spoonfuls of food
      she couldn&#146;t taste, and unseen hands that removed and then replaced
      the straps around her head. 
    The fourth feeding break arrived. Jessica ate the spoonfuls of food listlessly.
      She was depressed and demoralised and could scarcely remember why she was
      there. Something about ponygirls, she vaguely recollected. Minutes later
      she felt the rubber ball pushing at her lips. This time her mouth stayed
      closed. The ball pressed again, more insistently this time. She clamped
      her teeth together, refusing to let the ball in. Then she spoke, although
      she hardly recognized her own voice. 
    &#147;I&#146;ll do it. I&#146;ll be your ponygirl!&#148; 
    The ball pressed again, and Jessica panicked fearing that she&#146;d forgotten
      what she had to say to be released. 
    &#147;Please stop. I said I want to be a ponygirl. Isn&#146;t that what
      I&#146;m supposed to say?&#148; This time she was sobbing. 
    Erik picked up the phone and dialed Master Alex&#146;s suite. &#147;Sorry
      to wake you Sir, but I thought you&#146;d like to hear it for yourself.&#148; Erik
      removed Jessica&#146;s earplugs. She felt like she was slowly emerging
      from a cocoon, as a different creature. &#145;No! I&#146;m still the same
      Jessica,&#146; she reassured herself. 
    A minute later Master Alex was standing in front of the blindfolded Jessica.
      Erik showed him his new trick - he pushed the ball against Jessica&#146;s
      lovely lips. 
    &#147;I said I&#146;ll be a ponygirl...please!&#148; she said, as if begging
      them, weren&#146;t they the magic words they&#146;d been waiting for? 
    &#147;It&#146;s late Erik, why don&#146;t you leave Jessica here and get
      off to bed?&#148; Master Alex suggested. 
    &#147;Better not. She won&#146;t be ready to work tomorrow if we leave
      her like this. She can come to bed with me. That way she can start pony
      training in the morning. Ray will be very pleased to know there is a new
      ponygirl coming!&#148; 
    &#147;Two years!&#148; Jessica said, reminding Master Alex of his words
      to her. 
    &#147;Two years,&#148; he replied. 
    Jessica felt a gentle kiss on her forehead, and knew that her ordeal was
      over. Tomorrow would be a new beginning. 
    
       End of Chapter 2 
     
 
  
  
      Chapter 3. Jessica in Harness 
      (Even Ponygirls Sometimes Get the Blues, Aurelius) 
     
     
     
    The story so far:  
    (Ch. 1) Jessica&#146;s and Kate&#146;s escape, punishment and return. 
    (Ch. 2) A week of devious torments. Jessica has to make a decision 
     
    THE CELL 
    Released from her days of sensory deprivation, Jessica spent a peaceful
      night, loosely chained to the ends of Erik&#146;s large bed. She lay still,
      gradually waking in the first light of dawn, enjoying the clean sheets
      and soft mattress, studying the back of Erik&#146;s blonde head and listening
      to his deep slumbering breath. Whether he had raped her last night, she
      simply couldn&#146;t remember, but it didn&#146;t feel like it. Apparently
      she was in Erik&#146;s bed purely for convenience. She learned later that
      for health and fitness reasons ponygirls were required to sleep in proper
      beds, and Erik&#146;s was most convenient. 
    Jessica thought about the previous night and the agreement she had made.
      It was an absurd pact with Master Alex, a man whom she shouldn&#146;t trust
      but did, a man she shouldn&#146;t respect but did, a man she shouldn&#146;t
      like...and yet... 
    It had been her own decision: She had chosen to spend two years on Rabbit
      Island as a ponygirl. Master Alex guaranteed she would then be released
      back to her normal life. In the bright light of a new day it seemed an
      absurd promise to make. She liked certainty in her life and Master Alex&#146;s
      promise of a two year maximum was something she would cling to. &#145;Better
      the devil you know...&#146; she thought. 
    When Erik finally roused from his slumbers he took Jessica straight to the
    cells. Hers was a cell she hadn&#146;t seen before. It had a shower and a
    toilet, towels, toiletries and clean sheets on the bed. There was low shelf
    fixed to the painted breeze-block wall at table height, and on it was a small
    collection of paperback books, and a vase of orchids (from the Rabbit Island
    gardens naturally.) Jessica was amazed to find the shelf also held a brand
    new spiral-bound notepad and a pen. No envelopes and stamps for letters home,
    alas. 
     
    Compared to the standard set by the cell block this was a deluxe suite. Jessica
    couldn&#146;t help smiling, feeling strangely pleased with herself. If somebody
    thought she could be won over by such gestures... well perhaps they were
    right! 
     
    Jessica studied the books on the shelf - Black Beauty, My Friend Flicka,
      Green Grass of Wyoming, The Horse Whisperer. Hmm... she was detecting a
      theme in this little library. Required reading for ponygirls perhaps? 
    Picking up Black Beauty, she rifled through its pages with her fingers.
      This copy was well-thumbed, giving the impression she would soon have time
      to read it and the other books. It was a book she knew and loved from childhood
      and looked forward to enjoying again. It had been nearly a year since she
      had read a book. Jessica settled down on the bed and started reading. 
    HARNESSED 
    Two men appeared outside Jessica&#146;s bar-fronted cell before she had
      finished the third chapter of Black Beauty. 
    &#147;Jessica, you know Ray I think?&#148; Kurt asked, gesturing to the
      swarthy blonde-haired man alongside him. 
    &#147;Of course...Hi Ray!&#148; 
    &#147;Morning, Jessica.&#148; Ray responded, smiling awkwardly. 
    There was a palpable tension between them, even though they had met and
      spoken many times before; or perhaps because of it! They&#146;d even had
      various sexual encounters, which Jessica remembered were not altogether
      unpleasant. But this was a new beginning... Ray was a pony driver, and
      she was to be one of his ponies, assuming she could make the grade. 
    &#147;Lean against the cell bars with your hands behind you.&#148; Ray
      instructed. She did so and sensed the familiar feeling of cool steel handcuffs
      encircling her wrists. 
    With Jessica securely cuffed the men felt they could safely enter the
      cell. Jessica entertained the notion that they were frightened of her,
      of what she could do to them if her hands were free. She had been restrained
      for so many months that those fantasies were well developed in her thoughts.
      Somehow it made her feel better and stronger to think in that way. 
    She sat back down on the bed while Ray knelt and put boots on her feet. &#147;These
      are your pony-boots Jessica. If you put them on properly you&#146;ll find
      them quite comfortable and supportive.&#148; He laced up the cross-cross
      laces tightly to just below her knees. 
    &#147;Stand up!&#148; Ray commanded. 
    She stood, surprised to find the soles of the boots had elevated her so
      much that she was more than eye to eye with Ray. She wobbled as she found
      her balance, glad that Ray had a tight grip on her arm. The boots were
      like high heels but without the heel, and visually the shape was uncannily
      like a pony&#146;s hoof. The sturdy hiking-style sole provided a solid
      contact with the ground once the ponygirl had learned to balance herself
      on the balls of her feet. 
    Jessica knew what was to come next, she&#146;d seen the other ponygirls at
    close quarters many times. The harness was first: An array of connected leather
    bands fastened about her torso from waist to shoulders, each band pulled
    and buckled tightly. Little leather straps criss-crossed her breasts with
    a two-inch metal ring over her areola to leave her nipples free.  
    Ray instructed her to make her hands into fists so they could be fitted into
    the &#145;fist-bags&#146;. These were little suede bags that with the aid
    of Velcro strips kept her hands in a fist shape. (Looking at a harnessed
    ponygirl from behind, one simply did not want to see unsightly hands wiggling
    around!) Jessica&#146;s wrists were freed from the handcuffs but only to
    be strapped hammerlock style to the waist band at the back of the
    harness. 
     
    The bridle was next, tight leather straps around her head, and a rubber-covered
      metal bit between her teeth. Jessica&#146;s acquiescence to her pony transformation
      might have surprised her handlers, but she had struck a deal and she planned
      to honour it as long as she could. 
    As if the tight straps weren&#146;t enough to restrain her, small padlocks
      were clipped onto many of the buckles to ensure there would be no unauthorized
      release from the harness. 
    Then Ray held up an item for Jessica&#146;s inspection. &#147;When your
      handler has this in his hands you must turn your back on him, spread your
      legs, and bend forward.&#148; Jessica nodded to indicate she understood. 
    Ray and Kurt both laughed. &#147;I&#146;m your handler and this is in
      my hand. Can you remember what to do?&#148; 
    Jessica glared at him, being trussed up in leather straps was bad enough,
      but she did not like to be mocked. She bent over to prepare for the inevitable. 
    &#147;That&#146;s it...spread your legs a bit wider...bend forward a little
      more. Perfect! This ass is crying out for a butt-plug don&#146;t you think,
      Kurt?&quot; 
    Kurt smiled and nodded in agreement. 
    Ray slowly inserted the lubricated butt-plug in Jessica&#146;s anus, causing
      no more than an involuntary &#145;mmmm&#146; from her. 
    &#147;There you are. Didn&#146;t hurt did it? 
    The butt-plug was connected to a 12&#148; tail made from genuine black
      pony tail hair. Hidden in the base of the tail was a tiny bulb-pump that
      he squeezed between his finger and thumb several times. A balloon expanded
      in the body side of her anus, effectively locking the plug into her. He
      tugged on the tail to satisfy himself that it would stay in position. 
    Jessica stood up and felt the tail swish against the back of her thighs.
      The anal plug didn&#146;t hurt. She was more concerned about the way it
      was affecting her. It felt more &#145;interesting&#146; than she wanted
      How on earth could she run all day with it? 
    Ray attached a leash to the front of the harness and led an unsteady Jessica
      out into the courtyard; bells jingled on the boots as she walked. He took
      her onto the training track and started jogging alongside her. 
    &#147;Come on, Jessica, keep up. Let's see if you&#146;ve got what it
      takes.&#148; Ray called out as they jogged. Jessica could run pretty well
      and even in the pony gear was not taxed by his pace. After a few laps of
      the track they stopped alongside a little pony carriage. It was designed
      for one person sat low behind the ponygirl. It was called a sulky,
      a form of carriage used mainly for training new ponygirls.  
    Jessica&#146;s bridle had blinkers to block out her peripheral vision
      and a chain to hold her chin close to her chest. This made it impossible
      for her to see what Ray was doing behind her, but it was easy to guess!
      The shafts of the sulky were connected to Jessica&#146;s harness. 
    &#147;OK Jessica, you know your way round the track. Today you will run
      12 kilometres. That&#146;s 60 laps. You can take as long as you want, at
      any speed you want, stop when you need to, but no walking! We need to get
      you fit.&#148; She felt a tap of Ray&#146;s horse whip on her thigh. &#147;Off
      you go!&#148; 
    TRACKS OF HER TEARS 
    Trudging around the gravel track for dozens of mind-numbing laps, towing
      around the unmanned but ballasted sulky, taking several breaks for rest
      and water, Jessica wished she had kept a proper count. She was worried
      that they might not tell her when she had finished. Tired and bored, and
      straining against her tight harnessing Jessica considered making a dash
      for freedom while she was at the far side of the track, amusing herself
      at the surreal image of a fully harnessed ponygirl on the loose dragging
      a laden sulky behind her. No... a better plan was to keep on doing the
      laps until she was taken back to her cell. The trainee ponygirl continued
      for lap after lap until she was too tired to think of anything at all. 
    Hours later Jessica turned the corner into the home straight and saw Ray
      standing with feet apart, muscular arms crossed, as if determined to prevent
      Jessica from taking another lap without permission! With a few simple words
      of encouragement, he grabbed her halter rein and led her back to the Lodge.  
    They stopped off in the courtyard where Ray clipped Jessica&#146;s harness
      to a fence post. She soon found out what the chalk marks on her thigh were
      for. She&#146;d acquired themduring the course of the day. Ray put a few
      marks on her when she started talking during a water break, a couple more
      were added when she walked instead of ran. Now the seven chalks marks were
      converted into seven hits with the paddle on her bare ass. 
    Still harnessed and bridled, Jessica could do nothing to prevent Ray&#146;s
      meticulous application of the paddle. It was all so calm and matter-of-fact.
      Ray wasn&#146;t angry with her, he even whistled as he whipped! The hollow wop sound
      that accompanied the hard sting in her buttocks seemed to reverberate around
      the courtyard. 
    After Jessica&#146;s statutory spanking Ray begun talking with a man who
      had been watching from a distance. Perhaps, like a bee to honey he&#146;d
      been attracted by the sound of her spanking? 
    &#147;Hey there Doctor Schmidt, time for the first jab?&#148; Ray asked
      the man. 
    &#147;Ya, ve give a jab every two days.&#148; the German Doctor said. &#147;Is
      good. You vill soon see a big improvement from her.&#148; He prepared a
      syringe from a small wooden case with &#145;GDR&#146; stencilled in black.
      Doctors of the Former East German Olympic Team are never out of work. 
    Jessica felt the needle plunge into her reddened and stinging buttock
      as its mysterious load was deposited within her. 
    Soon after the injection, Ray took Jessica back to her cell and began
      stripping her of the ponygirl accoutrements. Ray found the release valve
      on the butt-plug and pulled it out carefully, holding the soiled plug before
      her eyes. &#147;See! No blood, just a little brown stuff as expected.&#148; He
      tossed it onto the floor of the shower area. 
    After being stripped of her tight constricting harness Jessica carefully
      examined the deep indentations in her flesh. &#147;Dammit Ray, those straps
      were tight,&#148; she complained. 
    &#147;It&#146;s better that way, it&#146;s the chafing from loose straps
      you should worry about. How are your feet?&#148; 
    Jessica lifted each foot on to the opposite knee in turn. &#147;Okay. No
    blisters,&#148; she conceded reluctantly. 
     
    Ray left the cell, and stood on the other side of the bars, very happy with
    his new ponygirl&#146;s first day. He nodded towards the leather harnessing
    piled onto the table in Jessica&#146;s cell. &quot;Clean them well Jessica
    or tomorrow you&#146;ll earn chalk marks before your day has even begun.&#148; 
     
    LUCY, THE PUSSY-GIRL 
    After two hours of polishing Jessica felt proud of her shining leather
      straps and boots. Lucy, one of the blonde pussy-girls brought her supper
      on a tray and an hour later returned to secure her for the night. They
      chatted amiably, although bunnies like Jessica were disdainful of pussy-girls:
      Brainless, spineless and a disgrace to the female sex. There were always
      new pussy-girl jokes doing the rounds in Jessica&#146;s old bunny camp. 
    &#147;Hey Lucy. Did you hear about the pussy-girl who broke her nose?&#148; Jessica
      asked the unsuspecting pussy-girl. 
    &#147;Noooo. What happened?&#148; Lucy enquired, eager to hear the latest
      Island gossip. 
    &#147;Yeah. She spotted a dildo under a glass table!&#148; 
    &#147;Ha ha, very funny!&#148; Lucy replied, not in the least offended.
      She held out a pair of handcuffs. &#147;Now lay back on the bed and place
      your hands on the cell bars.&#148; 
    Jessica obeyed, moving her arms either side of her head. The pussy-girl
      clicked handcuffs around her wrists trapping one of the vertical bars between
      them. They were normal handcuffs except for the longer chain connecting
      them. Jessica tugged at the cuffs in mild frustration, but this was light
      bondage compared to what she usually endured. 
    &#147;I don&#146;t understand. Why do you have to cuff me when I&#146;m
      already locked in my cell?&#148; 
    &#147;Island rules!&#148; Lucy explained. &#147;All women on the island
      are restrained at night, including me and the other pussy-girls, the females
      visitors; even the Filipina housemaids have agreed to be chained to their
      beds at night. They don&#146;t like it at first but they soon accept it,
      and their husbands seem quite happy with this arrangement. You&#146;re
      lucky Jessica. The ponygirls have a good life here. Isn&#146;t this better
      than being on the beach?&#148; 
    Jessica was left pondering that question as Lucy departed, turning off
      the main light as she went. 
    THE RINGED PONY 
    The second training day was much like the first. Lap upon lap of the track
      in order to build up Jessica&#146;s stamina. Despite her best efforts she
      still acquired a small collection of chalk marks on her thighs. She was
      disappointed to be told that her previous night&#146;s tack polishing had
      not been up to standard, so she earned two chalk marks before she had even
      left her cell. 
    Jessica knew that at some point she would receive the piercings of a ponygirl
      but had no idea it would be as soon as her second day. She was taken to
      the Prep Room within the Lodge. This room was something between a beauty
      parlour and a surgery. It contained every conceivable device for piercing,
      branding, tattooing and other beautifications. 
    Still strapped within her harness but with her hands temporarily free
      Jessica was fixed into the Star Frame. This was a upright steel device
      the size of a double door opening. Padded leather cuffs on Jessica&#146;s
      wrists and ankles were attached to each corner. An electric motor whirred
      and the slack disappeared from the four connecting wires. Jessica found
      herself stretched out then suspended in mid-air as her wide open legs lost
      contact with the floor. 
    The electric motor whirred a couple more times, tugging on Jessica&#146;s
      limbs, stretching her to such a degree that she feared the next hit of
      the motor would simultaneously dislocate her four limbs. Thankfully the
      motor stayed silent and the suspended X-shaped Jessica nervously awaited
      the arrival of the doctor. 
    A man and a woman came into Jessica&#146;s sight. Carole, the Island&#146;s
      beautician and Jurgen Schmidt, the &#145;jab&#146; doctor. 
    &#147;Time for your piercing!&#148; Carole announced with a warm smile
      as if presenting Jessica with a birthday present. Her fingers tweaked and
      squeezed Jessica&#146;s substantial nipples, as the doctor approached with
      a sterile wipe and the piercing gun. 
    Jessica struggled instinctively, wresting the nipple from Carole&#146;s
      grasp, but stretched and suspended she knew she was merely delaying the
      inevitable. 
    Carole stood back and waggled a finger disapprovingly. &#147;Jessica honey,
      I know it&#146;s a cliche, but &#145;resistance IS futile&#146;. You don&#146;t
      want to run around with lopsided nipple rings do you?&#148; 
    Resigned to her fate Jessica hung limply in her bonds and hoped her piercing
      torture would be over quickly. 
    Half and hour later, with permanent rings in her nipples and eight thick
      rings in her labia, an exhausted and hurting Jessica was finally released
      from the suspension device. Carole carefully explained how to care for
      her piercings and gave her the necessary supplies, then Jessica was delivered
      back to her cell. 
    Her evening was taken up with polishing her leather tack and caring for
      her piercings. After reading a couple more chapters of Black Beauty a pussy-girl
      arrived to chain her to the bed. Jessica was tired and gladly submitted
      to the pussy-girl. It meant another day was over. 
    Jessica laughed as she lay back on the bed in the darkness toying with
      the handcuff&#146;s chain between her fingers. &#145;Don&#146;t play with
      the piercings&#146; Carole had instructed. Well, at least that order was
      easy to follow! 
    BACK TO THE BEACH 
    Several days (and several of the Doctor&#146;s special jabs) later Jessica
      was thrilled to know that she was going on a trip that morning. After being
      harnessed in the usual fashion she was led out to be attached by a three
      meter bungee cord to the rear of a pony trap. 
    At first it was easy, trotting behind the pony pair at a gentle pace,
      yet it was somehow embarrassing too. It was a lowly and undignified position
      running behind a pony trap, but what could she do? If she didn&#146;t run
      she would fall. If she protested she would be beaten. 
    Jessica&#146;s belief in her ability as a runner were severely tested
      once the ponygirl pair ahead of her hit full stride. She could barely keep
      up even though the ponygirls were having to pull the cart and the driver.
      It was a total humiliation as she fell to the ground in an exhausted heap
      when they reached the first stop of the day. 
    She recognized their location once she recovered her breath. They were
      back at the beach cabin where she had spent the previous six months as
      a beach bunny. Jessica prayed none of her friends from the cabin would
      see her in such a wretched state. 
    After the pony driver had delivered the breakfast to the beach bunnies
      they were back on the trail again. Jessica fought back the tears as she
      trotted away from the cabin realising how much she missed her friends -
      especially her best buddy Kate! 
    IN TROUBLE 
    Perhaps it was the lack of human interaction during her training, but
      Jessica had become increasingly irritable during her weeks in pony training.
      This had culminated in her kicking a man as he &#145;inspected&#146; her.
      It happened when she was left tied up in the courtyard awaiting the day&#146;s
      punishments and yet another jab. An unknown man came up behind her, out
      of her line of sight, and began to aggressively grope her pussy, cruelly
      tugging on the still-new labia rings and pulling on her pony tail. She
      reacted instinctively by kicking out behind her. The single kick connected
      more firmly than she expected. It must have been the added weight of the
      pony-boots! 
    Ray, to his credit, came to her defence when the injured man reported
      her. &#147;Ponies kick! What do you expect if you touch them without first
      announcing your presence? Remember they are just dumb animals. You have
      to build up their trust,&#148; he explained to the man nursing his aching
      kneecap. 
    &#147;Dumb animal my ass! That bitch is dangerous!&#148; the man muttered
      to himself as he limped away. 
    Regardless of Ray&#146;s reassuring support for his trainee pony, Jessica
      knew she was in trouble again. 
    PUNISHMENT 
    Jessica was on her bed, sat back to the wall, legs outstretched and reading
      The Horse Whisperer, waiting for Lucy to chain her up for the night. She
      heard footsteps coming into the cell block; not the rapid clip-clip of
      a pussy-girl&#146;s regulation high heels but a man&#146;s soft casual
      stride as if he were inspecting the surroundings with each step he took.
      Master Alex appeared outside the bars of her cell. He wasn&#146;t smiling.
      Jessica tossed the book down and stood up obediently and with a degree
      of trepidation. The arrival of Master Alex was too much of a coincidence,
      coming on the same day as her kicking out at the visitor. 
    &#147;Have you finished cleaning your tack?&#148; He enquired. 
    &#147;Yes, Master Alex,&#148; Jessica replied, eyes cast downwards. 
    &#147;Very good, then come up to the cell bars.&#148; 
    She did so and stood face to face with her nemesis. Her dark eyes looked
      directly into his steely-grey yet warm communicative eyes. She wondered
      what might happen if those thick steel bars weren&#146;t between them.
      She stayed silent. 
    &#147;Now turn around and put your hands behind you and through the bars,&#148; he
      commanded softly. 
    When she did as he instructed she felt the familiar steel of handcuffs
      being clicked around her wrists. With her hands fixed either side of a
      vertical bar Jessica could do nothing except stay leaning back against
      the cool bars of her cell. Master Alex blindfolded her with a strip of
      black silk, his hands trailing over her face like a lover; softly, except
      for the final harsh tug on the knot which made her tremble. Jessica was
      not unhappy with the imposed darkness, it made a change from staring at
      the cell walls. 
    Master Alex&#146;s hands reached through the bars around her body and
      caressed her breasts. She could feel his breath tickling her neck. His
      hands repeatedly squeezed and released her breasts, eliciting, despite
      herself, an increasingly vocal response from her. Damn! She hated herself
      for how easily she becoming aroused, and the proximity of his body against
      hers, even with the bars between them, was more pleasurable than she would
      dare to admit. 
    His hands soon deserted her breasts and she sensed his body move away
      from the bars. Jessica listened carefully for a hint of what was next.
      She heard a light buzzing sound - a vibrator. Master Alex resumed his position
      behind her and his left hand returned to its respective breast, toying
      lovingly with its still sensitive piercing. Jessica spread her legs a little
      in anticipation of what was coming. After a little tentative probing, the
      dildo slowly entered her vagina. Once again she could feel Alex&#146;s
      breath upon her neck. After several weeks of enforced sexual abstinence
      Jessica was only too pleased to be brought to orgasm even in such a crude backstreet fashion
      as this. She knew that another couple of minutes of the vibrator would
      push her over the edge. 
    ...but it wasn&#146;t to be. The vibrator was suddenly withdrawn and Master
      Alex stepped away from Jessica&#146;s warm and yielding body. 
    &#147;Please don&#146;t kick our guests again, Jessica... sleep well.&#148; was
      all Master Alex said as he left the cell block, leaving Jessica chained
      to the cell bars. 
    &#147;Hey! I&#146;m a ponygirl... You can&#146;t leave me like this...
      Ponies are supposed to sleep lying down!...Isn&#146;t that one of your
      rules?&#148; Jessica shouted out, but hearing the door slam halfway through
      her protestation she knew she had just been given her punishment. 
    It took some minutes before the tearful Jessica figured out that she didn&#146;t
      have to remain standing. She could slip down the vertical bar and sit on
      the concrete floor. It was depressing knowing she wouldn&#146;t be sleeping
      on her comfortable bed, but rather on the concrete floor beside it. Realizing
      she could partly alleviate her plight, she reached up with her foot and
      gripped the blankets from the bed between her toes. Although her hands
      were cuffed behind her to the cell bar she managed to make a nest of the
      blankets between her body and the floor and settled down to a frustrating
      and miserable night. 
    PAIRED UP 
    Several more weeks of solo training took place before Jessica was considered
      strong enough for real pony duties. During that time, the intensive training,
      combined with Dr. Schmidt&#146;s Olympian drugs routine, had given Jessica
      a musculature in her legs that she could scarcely have dreamed of. 
    Jessica&#146;s piercings had &#145;matured&#146; well, thanks to the Doctor&#146;s
      specialist treatment. That meant the all-important reins could be attached
      to them. That first day, when Ray tested each of her rings and then attached
      the leather reins to them, was something Jessica would never forget. Ray
      and Jessica both shared a nervous excitement at the process, Jessica knew
      she had become aroused by Ray&#146;s manipulations. Tiny padlocks fixed
      a pair of reins to each of her nipple rings, the upper reins threading
      through her bridle either side her cheeks. The lower reins again originated
      at her breasts but led downward to meet though a single ring near her navel
      before being threaded through her labia rings (as in a Y shape) and from
      there back between her legs into the hands of her pony driver. 
    If that wasn&#146;t excitement enough for Jessica she then saw something
      in the courtyard that made her swallow hard. It was the standard Rabbit
      Island pony trap. This was a single axle carriage with a narrow two-person
      seat atop and a storage box underneath the seat. Standing proud, like a
      living statue six feet ahead of the driver&#146;s seat was a ponygirl,
      already connected to the front of the T shaped shaft by straps on her harness.
      Alongside the ponygirl at the top of the T was a vacant place for Jessica;
      where short connecting straps dangling invitingly, as if ready the ensnare
      the new ponygirl. 
    Ray backed her up into position and started securing her, and Jessica
      became aware that even standing shoulder to shoulder she couldn&#146;t
      see her new partner. With the hated martingale chain (the one that limited
      the lifting and turning of the head), and the side blinkers on her bridle,
      and now with the straps that fixed her to the shaft all she could do was
      stare at the track straight ahead of her. 
    INNOVATIONS 
    Having a new pony pair in training seemed the ideal time to introduce
      the latest innovation in pony trap design. Previously, to encourage or
      chastize the ponies, the driver would have to plant accurate whip strokes
      on each pair of buttocks in close succession. It was quite literally a
      hit and miss affair, and the whip unfairly &#145;favored&#146; the ponygirl
      on the whip hand side of the driver. Now, thanks to an ingenuous device
      from England that problem was solved. 
    Bolted on the shaft, nine inches back from the ponygirl&#146;s naked buttocks,
      the new equipment was a small battery powered rotary device. It spun rapidly,
      launching two leather cords with a speed and accuracy that ensured that
      all four pony buttocks received equal and properly weighted attention.
      A wire trailed from the device, down the shaft and ended in a small three-button
      remote control for the driver. 
    Ray mounted the padded bench seat on the trap and took some moments to
      organize the various reins that connected him so intimately with his ponies.
      As he drew in the slack from the lower reins, the ponygirls&#146; ringed
      nipples were pulled downwards to their full extent, signalling that the
      ponygirls should remain stationery. Ray pushed the first button on the
      whipper control. The whipping action was so quick that he didn&#146;t even
      see it, but a shocked squeak was emitted from both ponygirls. Perfectly
      synchronised! 
    After pressing the second button Ray was in no doubt about the effectiveness
      of the device as the ponygirls&#146; squeaks turned into loud squeals!
      He watched with delight as his ponygirls squirmed helplessly in their harnesses
      for a moment before regaining their composure. They&#146;d definitely felt
      that one, and a red mark appeared on each of four buttocks to confirm its
      effectiveness. His finger hovered over the third button, but he decided
      to resist temptation for a little longer. 
    With an eagerly anticipated tug of the upper reins he was under way with
      his new team. It was a messy and frustrating morning, coaxing and cajoling
      his ponies into working as a unit. It was also hard on the ears. The bells
      on the pony boots were supposed to ring out a harmonious rhythm, the left
      bells ringing out B and the right D#. When they were in step with each
      other it was a pleasing sound, otherwise it was an infuriating noise, liable
      to give the driver a headache. 
    Trying desperately to stay in step, Jessica and Debbie were drilled in various
    speeds and manoeuvres. It required great concentration from them, feeling
    the reins, sensing the other ponygirl and listening to the sound of their
    bells that was crucial to their timing. Developing that degree of coordination
    did not happen without a few tears and &#145;pony tantrums&#146; along the
    way. 
     
    Ray was good at what he did. As a former gym instructor he knew how to push
    his students to safe limits, how to teach and encourage, and how to deal
    with the tantrums brought on by tiredness, frustration or simple willfulness.
    He also knew that you can&#146;t turn a young woman into a pony without a
    few rebellious moments along the way. Being consistent in punishing bad behavior
    and rewarding good behavior (with nice words, petting or a tasty morsel),
    they learn the same way as a trained animal does. Breaking in Jessica was
    not proving particularly difficult. She was a quick learner, and soon discovered
    that it was better to simply obey without question. 
     
    The third button on the whipping control impressed Ray greatly, though
      the ponygirls considerably less so! It delivered a stinging lash to the
      back of the thighs. This instant punishment soon taught his ponygirls to
      behave, even if it did leave them whimpering in self-pity for a few moments
      afterwards. Jessica felt particularly bad when she realized her misbehavior
      resulted in the same lashes being delivered to Debbie as well as herself. 
    Considering it was Jessica&#146;s first day, it hadn&#146;t been so bad.
      Having had her chalk marks converted into paddle strokes as usual, Jessica
      and her red buttocks were safely back in the cell. Tired but satisfied,
      Ray headed straight to the bar for a cool beer, ready to recount his day&#146;s
      experiences to whoever wanted to listen. 
    REWARDED 
    A few days later Master Alex visited Jessica&#146;s cell again. It was
      the first time she had seen him since he teased and punished her several
      weeks ago. 
    Once again he cuffed her hands behind her back, thus securing her to the
      bars. And again he blindfolded her. 
    &#147;Please Master Alex, what have I done?&#148; Jessica asked, genuinely
      bewildered at receiving the same punishment again. 
    &#147;You&#146;ve done nothing that I know of. Except that Ray says that
      you are now properly broken in.&#148; 
    &#147;But that&#146;s good... Isn&#146;t it?&#148; 
    &#147;Sure it is! That&#146;s why I thought I&#146;d pay you another visit.
      I think we have some unfinished business.&#148; Alex teased her, his hands
      already at work on her breasts. &#147;Relax Jessica, just let yourself
      go.&#148; 
    The vibrator went to work between her legs, Master Alex shoving it firmly
    into her just to remind her who was boss. His hand soon felt her juices running
    over it. Jessica&#146;s thighs closed tightly around his wrist to ensure
    his hand and the dildo stayed right where they were. Jessica&#146;s fingers
    grabbed what came into her reach, and was reassured to feel the large and
    firm erection in his pants. He moved his pelvis back and out of her grasp
    but continued his ministrations on her warm sweaty body. 
     
    Her orgasm finally came after a great crescendo of grunting and rhythmic
    movement, noisy and violent, like she had seldom known. Master Alex remained
    quiet and continued working the dildo and holding her as he rewarded her
    with a second orgasm which shot through her, making her whole body tingle.
    She knew she would simply crumple to the floor if he let go of her. 
     
    When her thighs finally released his hand, he moved away, and sure enough
    she did crumple to the floor. Still not convinced of his motives Jessica
    was greatly relieved when Alex released her from the cuffs as she sat regaining
    her composure. She was still blindfolded, and even with her hands free she
    decided to stay in her darkness until instructed otherwise. 
     
    &#147;Ok Jessica, time for bed.&#148; Alex announced. She could hear the
      chain links of her &#145;bed-cuffs&#146; in his hands. Jessica groped around
      until she found her small towel and quickly wiped the moisture from her
      body. She laid back on the bed, pulled a sheet over her and stretched out
      her arms so that her hands were outside of the bars. It was always the
      same routine except usually she had to submit to whichever pussy-girl was
      given the task. 
    Master Alex slowly clicked the cuffs on her wrists as if savoring the
      moment. Then, as he moved away she felt his finger run tenderly across
      her hand, and she knew it was really a kiss. 
    GRADUATION 
    Just two weeks of intensive training were needed before Jessica and Debbie
      were ready to take the trial. After a comprehensive physical examination
      and an extensive time-trial that lasted the whole morning Jessica was awarded
      her plume - a beautiful ostrich feather ensemble that attached to the brow
      band of her bridle. Debbie re-acquired hers too, for ponygirls always work
      and are rewarded as a pair. After a quick rub-down and reapplication of
      the sun lotion that accentuated their impressive musculature so well, the
      cameras emerged from various pockets. That evening Rabbit Island subscribers
      around the world would see the photos and download movies of the ponygirls
      in full stride. 
    The view of a strong healthy ponygirl in her tight harness, with those
      reins so intimately attached and threaded was something that the Rabbit
      Island subscribers never tired of. &#145;The most practical work of
      erotic art ever devised&#146; was how one visitor described them. 
    Jessica, just like the other ponygirls, had started to derive a peculiar
      enjoyment from the intimacy of the harnessing routine that took place every
      morning. Ray&#146;s hands, whilst strong and efficient, also knew how to
      touch a woman&#146;s body. If he had cast her to the ground and fucked
      her in her harness and bridle, she really would not have minded. But pony
      drivers never had sex with their ponies - it was a strict rule. (Readers,
      don&#146;t cry for Ray - he still had 30 other females on Rabbit Island
      to choose from). Jessica also enjoyed what followed the harnessing process:
      A long hard run! Far stronger and fitter that she had ever been, her body
      seemed to crave the exercise. She was convinced that the regular injections
      administered by the doctor were more than just vitamins! 
    Why did the ponygirls feel such an affinity with a man that had bound
      them so tightly, whipped them so hard and made them run to the point of
      exhaustion? It was something Jessica and Debbie didn&#146;t understand.
      In the evenings Jessica sat in her cell, reading, thinking her own thoughts,
      plotting her escape and how to get revenge on those that had enslaved her;
      yet when she was in harness alongside Debbie, she belonged completely and
      utterly to Ray and thought of nothing else except running well, being obedient
      and winning his approval. On the day of the trial she knew she had also
      won the approval of many others. 
    The real prize for Jessica came in the evening when she was moved to the
      pony quarters. It was all she had dreamt of for the last month and now
      she had made it! The small swimming pool and jacuzzi were delightful, but
      most of all it was the companionship of the other ponygirls that she appreciated.
      For the first time, despite several weeks harnessed alongside Debbie she
      would finally have the chance to talk to her pony partner. 
    Relaxing in the jacuzzi, a plastic cup of wine in her hand, laughing and
      joking with Debbie, Jessica could scarcely remember being so happy.  
    But how long would it stay that way?

      AN UNWELCOME VISITOR 
      It felt great to be out in the fresh morning air and bright sunshine! 
      Jessica had always been a good runner. Sometimes it seemed like she
        was born to run; born to pound the gravel tracks extending over the hills
        and valleys of the island. Running alongside her, matching stride for
        stride was Debbie, her pony partner. Both women puffed hard as they pushed
        onwards, up a long gradual incline leading to the round summit of a hill.
      Within the space of their last few strides up the hill, the spectacular
        view of a turquoise sea and deep blue cloudless sky came suddenly into
        their view. From that point, the path became almost level as it followed
        the summit ridge allowing Jessica and Debbie to partially recover their
        breath as they ran ever onwards. Thanks to the the intensive training
        over the last few months Jessica had developed into a stronger and faster
        runner, and Debbie was pleased to have finally met her match.
      After that long downhill stretch the trail starts winding a little as
        it drops down towards a beach. Jessica and Debbie managed to check back
        their runaway stride in plenty of time to safely negotiate the twisting
        turns that lay ahead of them. Once they hit the first bend after the
        straight they both felt a repeated tugging on their lower-reins. Evidently
        their driver still thought they were going too fast! They reluctantly
        slowed down until they acquired a steady controlled trotting more befitting
        to well-trained ponygirls. The small bells on their pony-boots rung out
        softly and rhythmically - a useful cue for their synchronized strides
        and a satisfying sound to ponygirls and drivers alike.
      They had descended to sea level and were following the trail to the
        beach. A single tug on their lower-reins and a commanding shout of &#147;slow&#148; came
        from the driver. The ponygirls shifted from trotting into a brisk walking
        stride until they reached their destination. They halted at the very
        end of the trail where it abruptly met the sandy beach. Ray, their driver,
        jumped down from his lightweight single-axle trap ponygirls Jessica and
        Debbie had been pulling then looped their leather reins onto the adjacent
        hitching post.  
      A few yards along the beach was a wooden cabin where Jessica had once
        lived. 
      Ray lifted out two insulated steel pots from under the trap&#146;s bench
        seat. He carried them around the other side of the cabin where eight
        naked females were eagerly awaiting their breakfast. The so-called &#145;bunnies&#146; lived
        permanently in handcuffs but otherwise free and unsupervised at their
        beach cabin. 
      Jessica and Debbie stood side by side quietly staring out to sea, patiently
        awaiting Ray&#146;s return, harnessed and hitched, they could do little
        else. The bridle and bit assemblies that both wore prevented any meaningful
        conversation between them. Likewise, the blinkers fitted to the bridle
        straps and the short chain linked between chin and chest straps prevented
        the ponygirl pairing from even catching sight of each other. Yet it didn't
        bother them; they each knew instinctively how the other was feeling just
        from the way she ran. Though a ponygirl never spoke when in harness they
        would talk freely once they were released into their quarters that evening. 
      Each ponygirl had her arms strapped and padlocked firmly to the back
        of the harness in a &#145;hammerlock&#146; style. Furthermore her hands
        were held closed in a fist by a suede bag that contained wayward unsightly
        fingers. So firmly were the arms strapped within the body harness, that
        if it wasn&#146;t for the dull aching of the shoulders, ponygirl debbie
        wouldn&#146;t even think about her restrained arms. Ponygirl Jessica,
        still only a few months into her pony life, had a tendency to pull and
        twist against the harness straps that tightly encircled her torso. In
        a few more months her arms would become accustomed to the embrace of
        the harness and her futile little struggles would become rare.. 
      While Jessica fidgeted within her harness she heard the splashing of
        water beside her. Debbie was peeing as she often did at that point of
        the journey. Her water puddled around their boots for a few seconds before
        being absorbed by the gravel, leaving only a damp patch on the ground.
        There was no shame in a ponygirl urinating in this manner. In fact, it
        was considered befitting behaviour for such animals. Even Jessica did
        it - provided nobody was watching. Ponygirl debbie was something of an
        exhibitionist and took a perverse pride in urinating in public. She always
        remembered to drink lots of water the morning of a &#145;show day&#146; and
        looked forward to shocking unsuspecting visitors by releasing a stream
        of urine at the most inappropriate moment. If she got lucky she might
        manage to splash onto a lady visitor&#146;s expensive shoes! 
      While the ponygirls waited for Ray&#146;s return, one of the bunnies
        appeared from behind the cabin. It was Kate, the blonde English girl,
        and Jessica&#146;s best buddy during her time living in the cabin. Kate
        walked up to the ponygirls, awed by their imposing stature. A pair of
        ponygirls is an impressive site: With the thick running soles of the
        pony boots and the way the boot elevated her heels, Jessica stood well
        over six feet tall. Add the ornate ostrich plume fitted to her brow-strap
        and she topped out at an impressive seven foot. 
      Kate saw a very different Jessica than the one she knew in her days
        at the cabin. Besides being physically stronger and imposing there was
        a serenity, and obedience, and a purposefulness that Kate hardly recognized.
        Kate had made a bet with one of the other bunnies that the men at The
        Lodge would never be able to tame Jessica. She was obviously wrong and
        losing her bet meant she had licked a lot of pussies in the previous
        month. 
      Mindful of their blinkered vision Kate stood in the direct line of sight
        of the two ponygirls. &#147;Hi Jessica, hi Debbie. How are you doing?&#148; 
      The ponygirls made an 'ahhh' sound and nodded. 
      &#147;Have you seen what they&#146;ve done to us now?&#148; Kate asked
        them, intent on showing off the latest indignity inflicted on the bunnies. 
      She spun once around, kicking up the sand, to display the chastity belt
        she wore. Neat webbing straps around her waist and buttocks held a large
        moulded plastic shell tightly over her mound. Ponygirl Jessica studied
        it with great interest, thinking it looked like a slim-line version of
        a jockstrap her sporty older brother used to wear. 
      &#147;Ray says it only gets removed when we are taken up to The Lodge.
        It&#146;s just not fair, how are we supposed to enjoy ourselves in the
        evening? I thought they wanted us to be happy!&#148; Kate complained
        to her passive audience of ponygirls. 
      Jessica thought Kate looked pretty cute in her little jockstrap, pouting
        and stamping her feet in frustration. She couldn&#146;t fail to notice
        that Kate&#146;s slim frame had also been augmented by her recent conversion
        into a milkmaid. Her hitherto &#145;little handfuls&#146; had
        been transformed into a shapely size double D thanks to a treatment of
        hormones. Like the other milkmaids, her nipples and areole sported little
        steel covers (like tiny hats) to prevent unauthorized access between
        her milkings. A thin wire passed through the sides of the nipple and
        holes in the base of the nipple hat, then it was twisted and clamped
        like the seal on an electricity meter. 
      Kate had an impressive ability to change her mood in a split-second. &#147;Do
        you think my breasts are growing?&#148; she asked Jessica, sticking out
        her chest proudly. &#147;They milk me every day now. It feels quite nice,
        but when I first saw my milk going through the tubes, it was really kinda
        weird. I just wish I could touch them occasionally. It was a worthwhile
        trade-off though, I&#146;m finally rid of those leg-irons after two months
        of hell. Look, you can still see the white bands where they stopped the
        skin from tanning!&#148; She subconsciously tugged on the cuffs that
        kept her hands behind her back while looking down at her swollen teats
        white banded ankles. 
      The loquacious bunny Kate continued to relate her milking experiences
        to her captive audience of ponygirls until she was interrupted by Ray. 
      &#147;Kate, I told you to kneel by the whipping post, not stand around
        talking to the ponies!&#148; He shouted at her. She turned quickly on
        her heels and walked the few yards to the whipping post. Evidently not
        quick enough, as Ray&#146;s riding crop connecting sharply on her buttocks
        as she breezed past. 
      Ray&#146;s interest in Kate was well known and long standing. When a
        bunny was continually singled out for punishment by a pony driver it
        could only mean one thing! Kate&#146;s supposed misdemeanour today was complaining while
        Ray was ladling breakfast into the bunnies&#146; eating trough. 
      While Kate sulked next to the whipping post, Ray stowed away the empty
        breakfast containers beneath the seat of the trap, also stowing three
        small clear plastic pouches of milk extracted from Kate and the other
        two milkmaids in the camp. The pouches were carefully placed in a chilled
        bag that would keep them fresh until his next destination. 
      Ray was Australian, lean and muscular, with short blonde hair and a
        heavy tan. Good-looking too in Kate&#146;s opinion. He was the nearest
        thing Kate had to a regular lover, even if most of their sexual activities
        took place while she was tied to the whipping post. 
      Kate knelt with her side against the wooden post, gazing up at pony
        driver as he clipped a short chain from the post to her collar. Without
        prompting she opened her mouth wide as the leather covered ring-gag approached
        her face. Ray seated the ring firmly behind her front teeth, she looked
        down towards the sand to allow him to buckle the strap. He did so, not
        without a little tenderness. His soft stroking of her hair caused Kate
        to involuntarily lean her cheek into the palm of his hand, his thumb
        brushed her eyelashes, ostensibly to remove a grain of sand. 
      It was exasperating for Kate that after nearly a year he still didn&#146;t
        trust her with his cock. She concluded that he must prefer her with the
        ring-gag. It wasn&#146;t exactly an honor but it felt good to know she
        was somebody&#146;s favorite. Not every bunny could say that! She would
        have been devastated if Ray used another bunny for his morning blow job.
        With new bunnies arriving on the island all the time, it was Kate&#146;s
        constant worry. 
      Ray enjoyed those quiet moments when Kate could not answer back, although
        the ring-gag rendered her incomprehensible rather than silent. She knew
        Ray&#146;s large uncut cock intimately. As soon as he lowered his shorts,
        her mouth was onto it, like welcoming an old friend. Today she was even
        more attentive to his cock than usual. Perhaps her jockstrap chastity
        belt, in curtailing her regular nocturnal activities, was having the
        right effect! Nothing subtle or lingering was required of her, just a
        good honest passionate sucking. 
      Within five minutes Kate had dealt with his cock and Ray was attending
        to his restless ponies. The sight of Ray and Kate&#146;s encounter had
        caused them some agitation, as if often did. He wiped the moisture from
        between their legs with a clean towel. Then he checked the reins that
        ran from their nipple rings through a D ring on the belt then through
        a series of rings in their labia. It was vital that these areas were
        well-oiled - friction from the reins could have a detrimental effect
        on a pony&#146;s concentration and performance. With his ponies freshly
        lubricated and watered they were ready hit the trail once more. 
      Only at the last moment before he and his ponies were about to depart,
        did Ray bother to remove Kate&#146;s ring-gag. Without a word, they were
        off and running to the next beach camp where more bunnies were awaiting
        their breakfast. 
      &#147;Thanks Kate, for the excellent blow-job&#148;, she called out
        sarcastically as the ponies and their driver disappeared up the track. &#147;A
        little word of gratitude once in a while wouldn&#146;t kill him,&#148; she
        muttered to herself. 
      As was his habit Ray left Kate attached by the short chain to the whipping
        post. She could easily have called out for one of the bunnies to unclip
        the chain from her collar. Instead she stayed kneeling in the sand, licking
        her lips, enjoying the feel of the sand between her toes, and looking
        out at the sea gently lapping at the shore just a few yards away.  
      She noticed a stray splatter of Ray&#146;s cum on her breast. A regular
        badge of honor. Like a good bunny she always swallowed but the ring-gag
        didn&#146;t make that easy, and a little spillage was unavoidable. The
        small dab of semen made her reminisce about ponygirl Jessica. When she
        was also a bunny in the camp Jessica was the only one that ever accepted
        Kate&#146;s dare to lick Ray&#146;s cum from her breast. It sealed their
        friendship! 
      Kate was contentedly leaning against the whipping post. This spot felt
        like a second home, a place where she could quietly sit and think. But
        this &#145;home&#146; was becoming too familiar. Since Jessica&#146;s
        and her failed escape attempt several months previously (ch. 1) she hadn&#146;t
        even thought of escape. She had accepted her fate as slaves often do. 
      It was, Kate conceded, an easy life being a bunny. You just lounged
        around on the beach all day until someone came to take you up to The
        Lodge for a few days. Providing you didn&#146;t mind living in handcuffs
        and eating with your face in a trough it was really quite okay. But the
        chastity belt and the nipple hats represented the last straw. How could
        she live without a little sexy playtime with the other bunnies? With
        the chastity belt curtailing her fun and without Jessica to mess around
        with, life just wasn&#146;t so tolerable any more. It was time to get
        away. Time to leave the beach cabin behind... but how? 
      Running away was not an option. She was on an island. Stowing away on
        a boat wouldn&#146;t be so easy next time. Since their last attempt boat
        security had been tightened. 
      Kate weighed up her options. At five foot six inches, she was simply
        too small to join Jessica in the pony stables, and besides, it looked
        damned hard work running ten miles each day. &#145;Perhaps The Lodge
        have a vacancy for a pussy-girl?&#146; she pondered. The pussy-girls
        at The Lodge often helped with the ponies&#146; grooming and other services,
        so that might be a way to spend time around Jessica. Beside being a good
        friend, Kate maintained her belief that Jessica represented her ticket
        off the island. 
      She mentally ran through the &#145;qualifications&#146; of pussy-girls
        and evaluated how she measured up to them. 
         
        - Pretty? Yes, cute as a kitten. Everyone says so.  
        - Slim figure? Yes, except for her recently enhanced, milk-laden breasts.  
        - Blonde? Yes...well, kind of mousy blonde. But then some of the pussy-girls
        were only bottle-blondes, so that wouldn&#146;t matter.  
        - Nice smile? Absolutely.  
        - Happy disposition? Annoyingly so, except for very occasional hissy
        fits.  
        - Obedient and trustworthy? Well.... that could be the problem. They
        were not the two words that most people would readily associate with
        her. Except maybe for the two years she worked as a nurse. That was what
        landed her into this situation in the first place - taking a job in a
        Kuwait hospital. 
      There was one thing that troubled Kate most about becoming a pussy-girl:
        She would be jumping over the fence, so to speak, and that was a treacherous
        act in the minds of the bunnies. It meant &#145;sleeping with the enemy&#146; in
        every sense, acknowledging that you consented to the cruel activities
        of The Lodge. 
      Having weighed up the pros and cons, her mind was made up. It was time
        to be pragmatic. She would swallow her pride and attempt to become
        a pussy-girl. It might not be easy, but how else was she ever to get
        away from this place? 
      &#147;You look deep in thought.&#148; A voice said behind her. 
      Kate jolted in shock, not realising that Nancy, one of the other bunnies,
        had quietly walked over to the whipping post to unclip her collar. 
      It was several days before she thought about her plan again, little
        realizing that events were about to conspire to make it happen. 
      PONY NIGHTLIFE 
      If there was one thing that made the lives of ponygirls tolerable it
        was the regularity of their routine. They had a job to do, providing
        nearly all of the island&#146;s transportation when coupled to a two-person
        trap and often a trailer too. 
      The ponygirls worked a week of late shifts alternating with a week of
        early shifts. Each shift had its advantage: The early shift enjoyed a
        relaxed and sociable evening in the pony quarters. The off-duty ponygirls
        could soak in the jacuzzi, enjoy a meal and chat endlessly, as ponygirls
        were inclined to do after a day in harness and bridle. The late shift
        provided the benefit of a morning lay-in. This was also appreciated by
        the staff of the Lodge. The late shift ponygirls were likely to find
        themselves being used and abused in somebody&#146;s bedroom know that
        they weren&#146;t required for morning duties. 
      Ponygirl Jessica seemed to have become a fixture in Master Alex&#146;s
        night-time routine. Although their encounters were no more than once
        a week, she vainly sensed that he had an attraction to her, almost a
        fascination towards her. Both hailing from New York and being avid baseball
        fans surely couldn&#146;t have been the whole story! Sometimes he was
        cruel to her, and sometimes he was kind. It couldn&#146;t be called love,
        but it certainly wasn&#146;t hate or indifference! 
      After their lovemaking, Jessica usually spent a relatively comfortable
        night tied to Alex&#146;s bed. In the morning it was time for the soft
        white ropes. It was Alex&#146;s regular habit to place her in an elaborately
        knotted hogtie. Jessica no longer worried as Alex spent half an hour
        binding up her limbs with infinite precision and care. They often talked
        and sometimes joked while he worked on her. 
      Once she had been transformed into the neat, naked hogtied bundle that
        Alex desired, he gagged her with a ring-gag. Then he propped himself
        up in bed with Jessica as a neat bundle of warm femal flesh helplessly
        trapped between his outstretched legs. He tied a leather cord around
        the base of his cock, inserted it fully into Jessica&#146;s wide open
        mouth then tied the ends of the cord tightly to her ring-gag. 
      Jessica had been gagged in more ways than she could count since she
        arrived on Rabbit Island, but this was altogether the most interesting.
        Once they were intimately conjoined Master Alex read the newspapers to
        her as was his habit, occasionally petting Jessica&#146;s hair as if
        she were his favorite labrador. The baseball season was over, so the
        ritual of his reciting the results of their shared sporting passion had
        ceased. Instead he read out random snippets of news that he thought might
        interest her. Jessica was reassured yet also saddened that the rest of
        the world continued to exist perfectly well without her. 
      One story caught Alex&#146;s attention, and as he read it Jessica noticed
        a distinct swelling of the cock within her mouth... not unlike when he
        announced that the Yankees had won! He read it to her: 
      MYSTERY OF ARMLESS AMERICAN. An American woman was last week found
          walking naked on a remote beach near Koh Samui in Thailand. Both her
          arms had been amputated at the shoulder, although she is unable to
          explain when or how this happened. She appears to be suffering from
          severe amnesia. The unfortunate woman remains in the care of the American
          Consulate at Phuket while they try to ascertain her identity... AFP 
         
        Although the news appeared to have no connection to Rabbit Island the
        story played on Alex&#146;s mind for the remainder of the day. 
         
      AN UNUSUAL SIGHTING 
      That same evening Jessica and Debbie were running their usual route,
        taking food to the bunny camps and collecting produce from the orchard.
        After delivering the evening meal to the bunny camp Ray returned to the
        where the ponygirls always waited. He was escorting two of the bunnies,
        and neither he nor the bunnies were happy. One of his hands gripped the
        upper arm of each naked female as he escorted his reluctant companions
        to the whipping post. The two bunnies looked pretty upset. One of them
        was Jessica&#146;s old friend Nancy, a very slim woman with straight
        dark hair and fierce intelligent eyes. She struggled every inch of the
        way, never being one to accept her fate without a fight. 
      &#147;Ray. It&#146;s not fair. We were merely stating that these new
        jockstrap-things are uncomfortable,&#148; she explained. &#147;I&#146;ve
        got a terrible itching. It&#146;s a simple statement of fact!&#148; 
      Ray was not convinced. &#147;Sorry, bunny nancy. That sounds like a
        complaint to me, and you know the punishment for complaining,&#148; he
        said impassively. 
      He secured Nancy in position to await her lashes. Like the other bunnies
        she already had her hands locked in cuffs behind her, Ray forced her
        to bend over, then lifted her arms, attaching them by a short chain to
        the post at head height. Alongside Nancy, with the post separating them,
        was Mandy. She was quiet as usual, and almost in tears before the punishment
        had even started. The bunnies were all-too-familiar with the strappado
        position - standing bent forward with arms behind them and held high.
        Within minutes their shoulder and arms ached terribly, although its main
        purpose was to present their asses for punishment. 
      Much to the watching ponygirls&#146; approval Ray took off his polo
        shirt before he commenced the bunnies&#146; paddling. He was naturally
        lean, though with nice muscle definition, and looked quite the athlete
        when he was wielding a paddle. The two bent-over bunnies twitched their
        buttocks nervously as they waited for the first blow, not knowing on
        which one of them it would land. 
      It was Nancy&#146;s neat, almost boyish rump that felt the first stinging
        hit. She grunted in response the pain, stoical as ever, although she
        would have gladly accepted a gag to help stifle her cries. If she wasn&#146;t
        so proud she would have howled. 
      Mandy, bent over next to Nancy, yelped at the first stroke on her behind
        and was soon in a blur of tears and sobbing as the rest of her strokes
        were diligently applied by the pony driver. 
      Ray then gave Nancy five extra strokes for resisting him.
        Having created two pairs of delightful red buttocks he felt his work
        was done in this particular camp. 
      He immediately released the chains and sent the chastened bunnies and
        their stinging red butts scurrying back to their cabin. He could distinctly
        hear Nancy muttering obscenities at him under her breath, he&#146;d be
        disappointed if she weren&#146;t. Ray diligently recorded the details
        of the punishment in his small notebook. 
      It may seem perverse, but ponygirls Jessica and Debbie enjoyed watching
        the bunnies get a paddling; and the harder the better. Perhaps it was
        because the bunnies had such an easy life, compared to the full working
        day of the ponygirls. Ray was a good-looking guy and watching him in
        action, wielding a whip or paddle on someone, was a pleasurable interlude
        in the working day of a ponygirl. Ray had long realized his ponygirls&#146; interest
        in the punishments. After all, he had to attend to their reins passing
        by their intimate areas. He always made sure his ponies were dried off
        and that &#145;proper&#146; lubricant was reapplied to the relevant area. 
      They were making good speed back along the winding route when Ray tugged
        hard on their reins, and Jessica&#146;s ringed nipples were pulled down
        to the full extent that her reins allowed. The ponygirls halted immediately,
        confused and curious. 
      Ray dismounted from the trap, and without a word to his ponygirls he
        started scrambling down the steep rocky ravine at the side of their gravel
        track. He had spotted something laying a few yards down in the distance,
        something unusual in the litter-free, unspoilt, unpolluted scenery of
        Rabbit Island. He edged his way down towards the bright object that had
        caught his eye.  
      Perhaps the excitement at his imminent discovery had distracted him.
        He lost his footing on loose bolder, tumbled head over heels. He broke
        a wrist in the attempt to arrest his fall, but not even that could prevent
        his head cracking against a protuding boulder. 
      It went silent. Even the birds on the trees seemed to become silent.
        The ponygirls became aware that something was amiss. They had heard the
        sound of Ray&#146;s fall and then... nothing. Unable to see beyond their
        blinkers or to communicate adequately through their bitted mouths, they
        stood quietly listening for a couple of minutes, hoping to hear a sound
        from down the slope. Jessica could wait no longer, she moved over to
        the edge of the track to look for Ray. Joined together in harness, Debbie
        came too. 
      The ponygirls stood peering over the edge and saw Ray laying motionless,
        and alongside him a scrap of white fabric shone luminously in the gloom
        of twilight. 
      &#147;Hway?&#148; Jessica called out to him, having discarded her role
        as a ponygirl but unable to divest herself of the harness and other trappings
        that rendered her helpless to assist her injured driver. 
      &#147;Hway!&#148; Debbie shouted, but there was still no movement from
        Ray&#146;s body a few yards beneath them. 
      &#147;Veegh!&#148; Jessica said to Debbie - they had to get back to
        the beach. 
      The distressed and driverless ponies started running back to the beach
        cabin adjusting to how unbearably light the trap was behind them. Jessica
        would almost have welcomed the sting of the whipper and the familiar
        feel of Ray&#146;s sensitive tugging on her reins. 
      The bunnies, having heard the sound of sleigh-bells that accompanied
        the ponygirls&#146; arrival, were already waiting for them as Jessica
        and Debbie pulled up at the end of the trail. 
      &#147;What&#146;s happened to Ray?&#148; Kate asked the breathless ponies,
        immediately sensing the distress in their agitated behavior. 
      &#147;Hway hurh!&#148; Jessica announced as clearly as she could. 
      Kate understood. &#147;Where? Where is he? What&#146;s happened?&#148; 
      Jessica&#146;s garbled explanation, due to that rubber-covered steel
        bit in her mouth, was useless. All of a pony&#146;s harnesses and bridles
        were locked on, so there was not a chance that the bunnies could release
        the ponygirls. 
      &#147;Take me to him!&#148; Kate said, deciding to take charge of the
        situation. She walked behind the ponygirls and stepped up onto the bench
        seat of the trap. Nancy did likewise, but her reason for going to Ray&#146;s
        aid was very different to Kate&#146;s. 
      Hauling two bunnies was much more difficult than an experienced pony
        driver. With their hands cuffed behind them, all Kate and Nancy could
        do was grip the backrest of the bench in a bid to stay on board as the
        ponygirls puffed and panted up the steep slope from the beach.  
      Kate saw some controls just in front of her: Three colored push buttons.
        Curious to find out what they were for she succeed in pressing one of
        them with her toe. She thought nothing happened, yet something must have
        happened because the ponygirls picked up their pace slightly. Her toe
        managed to press the second button. This time there was no mistaking
        the action of the whipper. The ponygirls yelped in pain and quickened
        their pace once again. Kate shouted out an apology, while Nancy shook
        her head in disbelief. Two naked handcuffed females were driving and
        whipping a pair of ponygirls! 
      In her eagerness to come to Ray&#146;s aid Kate didn&#146;t hesitate
        to press the whipper button several more times. It seemed to help them
        maintain a good speed. The ponygirls slowed as they neared the point
        where Ray fell, then stopped and slowly turned to look over the end of
        the ravine. Kate and Nancy jumped down from the trap and joined the ponygirls
        in peering over the edge. 
      &#147;I can see him,&#148; Kate said, and immediately stepped cautiously
        down into the ravine. It wasn't easy with her hands chained behind her,
        the jagged rocks hurt her bare feet much more than the sand she usually
        walked on. She reached Ray&#146;s body and took a pulse from his wrist.  
      &#147;He&#146;s alive!&#148; Kate shouted upwards. 
      Nancy had also scrambled down and positioned herself on Ray&#146;s other
        side. &#147;His keys. We need to get out of these cuffs if we&#146;re
        to help him.&#148; She located them in one of his pockets and after several
        minutes of desperate fumbling Kate and Nancy were free of their handcuffs,
        though they still hung down their backs, connected to the chain attached
        to their collars. 
      Kate retrieved the scrap of material that Ray had been investigating
        and used it to make a sling for his broken arm. Nancy returned to the
        ponygirls to raid the trap&#146;s toolbox for some rope. It felt wonderful
        to have her hands free for the first time in weeks, even if it did take
        a while to regain her coordination. Nancy led the ponygirls into a position
        facing away from the ravine, then tied the end of the rope to the rear
        of the pony trap. She descended down the ravine again. 
      While Kate and Nancy roped up Ray&#146;s unconscious body, the ponygirls
        stood and stared into the rapidly encrouching darkness. Jessica tensed
        her muscles against the tight bands of leather encircling her torso,
        furious at being so useless at a time like this. 
      Outside of Jessica&#146;s blinkered vision someone stood in the shadows
        watching her; a woman in khaki shorts and shirt, with a rucksack on her
        back. As she approached the ponygirls her footsteps sounded softly on
        the gravel track alerting Jessica of her presence. She took a flash photograph
        of ponygirls from behind then moved to take another from the front. 
      She moved to comfort Jessica, stroking her hand over the harness straps,
        studying the complex arrangement of straps and reins that restrained
        the ponygirl. She sensed fear in Jessica&#146;s eyes, together with a
        degree of shame at being discovered in a state more fitting to a beast
        of burden than a young woman. 
      &#147;Hush. It&#146;s okay, I&#146;m not going to hurt you. I&#146;m
        Karen Galtz from the Global News Corp. I&#146;ve been investigating Rabbit
        Island for a long time. I can&#146;t help you to escape until my investigation
        is complete. They must not know that I&#146;m here.&#148; Jessica nodded
        to indicate she understood. 
      &#147;Jesus, they sure know how to truss up a gal!&#148; Karen exclaimed
        with evident admiration as her fingers ran over Jessica&#146;s harness
        straps. &#147;I simply have to take some more pictures!&#148; 
      The reporter clicked and flashed her camera several more times, ensuring
        there were some good close-ups. &#147;Excellent!&#148; She said, apparently
        more pleased than disturbed by the discovery of the ponygirls.  
      &#147;Okay ponies, pull now!&#148; Kate shouted from the ravine below.
        Slowly, inch by inch, Ray&#146;s still unconscious body was hauled back
        up to the track. Karen Galtz lent a hand. Kate and Nancy&#146;s naked
        bodies emerged from the ravine with Ray held up between them. Exhausted
        from the strain on their weak arms they laid Ray on the ground. 
      Kate dusted down her body, then stared in disbelief at the woman. &#147;Who
        the hell are you?&#148; 
      &#147;Karen Galtz, Investigative Journalist.&#148; The stranger announced,
        holding out her accreditation card at arm&#146;s length. 
      Kate gave a cursory glance toward the small laminated card. Despite
        Ms Galtz&#146;s sympathetic expression Kate eyed her with suspicion.
        She already sensed that Ray&#146;s injuries were somehow related to this
        woman&#146;s arrival on the island. 
      &#147;Are you going to rescue us?&#148; Nancy asked, unable to contain
        her joy. 
      &#147;I guess so,&#148; said Karen Galtz, although the ambiguity of
        her response wasn&#146;t lost on the others, &#147;but first I have to
        investigate this place and file a report with my employer. It could take
        several weeks.&#148; 
      Nancy waved her newly liberated hands around as if they were new toys. &#147;Look,
        I&#146;m already free, and I&#146;ve got a set of keys to release the
        others. Kate would rather take her lover-boy back to the lodge, but I
        want off this island. Do you have a spare set of clothes I can have?&#148; 
      &#147;Sure Honey, they&#146;re in my backpack!&#148; Galtz gestured
        to the pack on the ground at the side of the trail. She exchanged a conspiratorial
        glance with Kate. 
      Nancy unclipped the backpack, rummaging within it for something to wear.
        Meanwhile the reporter was preparing to ensure her venture would not
        be derailed by a loose bunny. She raised her hand over Nancy&#146;s unsuspecting
        head. In that hand she held a small rock. The thud of the well-aimed
        blow on the side of the head knocked Nancy to the ground, leaving her
        out cold on top of the backpack. Galtz quickly moved to replace Nancy&#146;s
        convenient cuffs back on her wrists. 
      The reporter tossed the bunch of keys over to the stunned Kate. &#147;You&#146;d
        better take these with you to the lodge. I&#146;ll see to it that Nancy
        gets back to her beach cabin. Let me help you lift that guy up on to
        the seat.&#148; 
      Kate breathed a sigh of relief when she saw that Nancy was regaining
        consciousness. It took Nancy a minute before she realized what had happened
        and managed to stand up. She tugged angrily at her cuffs, unable to believe
        how brief had been her freedom from bondage. 
      The woman that Nancy had earlier thought was her savior stood watching
        the ponygirls depart. Nancy, wearing nothing but her chains and hi-tech
        chastity belt gazed at the woman with hatred, but Karen Galtz just smiled
        back at her as if everything was perfectly normal. 
      Karen Galtz&#146;s apology to Nancy was perfunctory, and came with a
        promise that she would explain her presence on Rabbit Island as they
        walked back to the beach. Nancy had no choice but to grumpily escort
        her unwelcome companion back to the cabin. 
      In the other direction the subdued ponygirls were making cautious pace
        in the darkness. They&#146;d tried to tell Kate to switch on the flashlights
        fitted to their brow bands, but she couldn&#146;t make out what they
        were saying. Kate held Ray&#146;s unconscious body tightly in her arms,
        comforting him as best she could. Soon they would be at The Lodge, and
        Ray would get the medical attention he needed. Kate hadn&#146;t even
        thought about what would happen to her. 
      There&#146;s an old saying: out of misfortune comes opportunity,
        as Kate would soon discover for herself.

        Karen Galtz, an investigative journalist arrives on the island. 
      A DELICATE OPERATION 
      The lights of the Lodge&#146;s cobbled courtyard were a welcome sight.
        Jessica and Debbie pulled up right in front of Riccardo, one of the other
        pony drivers. His own ponygirls were standing, still fully harnessed,
        attached to the punishment frame. Their buttocks twitchily awaiting more
        strokes of his rubber paddle in payment for their minor infractions during
        their day. 
      There were other people in the courtyard as well. The usual male handlers,
        overseeing the activities; and guests, men and women, in dinner jackets
        and evening dresses, enjoying a pleasant little diversion, their pre-dinner
        aperitifs in hand. 
      The handlers, looking up at the arriving pony trap, were surprised to
        see Ray bringing a bunny back to the Lodge, and assumed that she might
        be in need of medical attention. Jaws dropped when they saw that it was
        the naked bunny next to him that had been driving. 
      &#147;Help. Ray&#146;s hurt.&#148; Kate called out to them. 
      The men lifted a barely conscious Ray down from the trap seat. &#147;No,
        you need a stretcher!&#148; The bunny&#146;s urgent shout shocking not
        just the handlers but herself too. 
      Such was her consuming concern for Ray&#146;s health that neither of
        the handlers turned stretcher bearers blocked her way as she followed
        the stretcher into the medical suite. 
      &#147;He&#146;s broken his arm, quite likely his ankle, and may have
        also fractured his skull too. He was unconscious for a while.&#148; Kate
        informed them, expecting at any moment she would be locked in her cuffs
        and fitted with one of their infernal ball-gags. 
      They looked at her blankly. &#147;Look bunny, we&#146;re not doctors.
        Dr Schmidt won&#146;t be back till tomorrow. We could sedate him with
        morphine and make him comfortable till then.&#148; 
      &#147;Kate! My name&#146;s Kate! He needs treatment now. I&#146;m a
        nurse, or at least I was until I got kidnapped and brought this damned
        island! Where&#146;s Master Alex? I heard he used to be a doctor!&#148; 
      One of the men picked up the phone and punched in a number. &#147;Master
        Alex...yes, Master Kurt here. Can you come over to the medical suite
        as soon as possible?&#148; He replaced the handset. &#147;He&#146;s coming
        over now.&#148; 
      Kate was already checking out the equipment in the surgery. An operating
        table, EEG, ECG, oxygen, and X-ray equipment all close to hand. As a
        former theater nurse she began to feel at home as she acquainted herself
        with her surroundings. Master Alex walked in. 
      &#147;Master...Sir...please...you&#146;re a doctor aren&#146;t you?&#148; Kate
        asked desperately. 
      &#147;...of philosophy, bunny kate. What&#146;s wrong with him?&#148; 
      By the time Kate had finished explaining what had happened, Kurt and
        the other handler had resumed their other duties leaving her and Master
        Alex alone in the medical suite. It was true, Master Alex wasn&#146;t
        a medical doctor but he sheepishly admitted that he&#146;d done a year
        of medicine at Harvard. 
      Over the next three hours the unlikely pairing worked together as a
        team, carrying out X-rays, setting broken bones, giving their patient
        the best care they could manage. Master Alex used the medical suite&#146;s
        computer to log on to an internet-based medical advice center. It proved
        a great way to fill in the gaps in their knowledge. 
      Kate&#146;s milk-laden but shapely breasts flopped around conspicuously
        as she went about her tasks. Master Alex couldn&#146;t help but come
        into visual and occasional bodily contact with them. To preserve his
        own sanity he found a white apron for her to wear, tying the strings
        tenderly at her back, whilst observing Kate&#146;s own minor injuries
        across her rear. The apron covered little except the front of her torso,
        and with the apron strings dangling tantalizingly down her ass crack
        it served to make her rear view even more appealing. For Kate the apron
        signalled a small but crucial change to her status: She was a nurse again! 
      Master Alex was a busy man, Kate discovered, constantly fielding phone
        calls and occasionally having to step out of the medical suite to attend
        meetings he had arranged. It was during one of his absences that Kate
        attended to her own small injuries on her buttocks and thighs. 
      When Master Alex returned from yet another meeting he found Kate stitching
        up a small gash that he hadn&#146;t noticed before. The wound, at the
        bottom crease of her left buttock, had Kate twisting awkwardly as she
        tried to make the stitches. Alex felt almost touched that Kate had been
        neglecting her own wounds until then, such was her concerned for Ray. 
      &#147;Why didn&#146;t you let me do that?&#148; He asked, almost disappointed,
        as he gazed with admiration at Kate&#146;s contorted body. &#147;Let
        me finish off before you stretch the wound and make it a whole lot worse.&#148; 
       She couldn&#146;t argue with him even if this was one job she&#146;d
        rather have managed herself. Yet it felt good to have somebody fussing
        over her for a change. A man showing tenderness - now that was a novelty!
        The best part was that he decided it was necessary to remove her chastity
        belt, exposing her sex to the open air for the first time in more than
        a week. Alex watched with evident interest as she cleaned herself vigorously
        with a damp cloth. 
      &#147;I told the handlers that these plastic covers are not sanitary.&#148; Kate
        said holding up the plastic moulding that had covered her pussy for the
        last week. 
      &#147;Compared to what bunnies were getting up to on the beach, I think
        they are much healthier.&#148; Alex retorted. &#147;The things you bunnies
        had been sticking in your holes was quite disturbing. You, kate, were
        even photographed using the stump of tree branch!&#148; 
      &#147;And why did we do that?&#148; Kate&#146;s anger was beginning
        to boil up, as it so easily did when stressed. &#147;...because of the
        drugs you feed us. That&#146;s why! Sometimes I&#146;m so desperate for
        a fuck I&#146;d sit on a rusty pipe if I could get some relief! Even
        now my body is screaming for relief, though it&#146;s the last thing
        I really want to do.&#148; 
      She glanced towards Ray, in bed, wired up to various monitors, as if
        to explain the comment. 
      IN THE BATHROOM 
      Master Alex dialled a number on the phone and made a brief request.
        A minute later a pussy-girl arrived with a long plastic box. He opened
        it and handed Kate a vibrator. &#147;Would this be of any help? Maybe
        it will help you relax.&#148; 
      She grumpily snatched it from his hand and ran into the adjacent en-suite
        bathroom. 
      &#147;Leave the door open!&#148; Master Alex called out just as she
        reached for the door handle. 
      He watched her take a kneeling position, knees spread wide, defiantly
        facing towards him as if to prove a point. With her sun-bleached blonde
        hair and pretty features, she suited the heavy leather collar around
        her neck; particularly with that look on her face as she took hold of
        the vibrator. Alex wondered why he&#146;d never fucked her before. 
      After fiddling impatiently to locate the switch, the vibrator came to
        life, and so too did Kate&#146;s body as she held it against her sex.
        With her eyes closed and mouth open she teased herself with the vibrating
        tip, her breathing becoming more urgent and ragged. Soon the vibrator
        had become the best substitute of a penis, plunged fully into her as
        if searching for some magical spot deep inside her belly. She bucked
        up and down repeatedly, abandoning any sense of self-control, her bountiful
        breasts bouncing with a life of their own. 
      Her first orgasm came - a dramatic and almost desperate thing - her
        moans echoed around the tiles walls, giving vent to the pent-up tension
        within her. Her paced slackened only briefly, as one hand reached up
        to grasp a breast, now moist with perspiration. Feeling for a nipple
        to play with, she found only the metal cap held on by a wire piercing
        the nipple. Not only did it protect her milk but denied her that fundamental
        woman&#146;s pleasure. She tugged and twisted the nipple cap frustratedly
        but sensed how little joy it could yield. 
      By the time of bunny Kate's second orgasm, Alex could hold out no more.
        He simply had to get his hands on those breasts, for both of their sakes.
        While she continued masturbating, eyes still closed, mouth still open,
        he knelt behind her. His hands reached around to grasp her heavy breasts,
        squeezing them, digging his fingers into her flesh as if they were claws,
        whilst encouraging her to continue plunging herself with the vibrator.
        She came again, seemingly insatiable. 
       Master Alex lifted and dragged her to the toilet seat and laid her
        belly and breasts across its wooden lid. Taking each of her hands in
        turn, he fastened them into the handcuffs still dangling from the chain
        connected to her collar. Kate was too far gone to care what he did. 
      Spooning himself behind her, and lowering his pants to his knees, he
        pushed his rock-hard erection forcefully into her warm and damp sex...
        and she was glad to have it; that much was obvious. Holding a handful
        of her hair in his fist he forcefully pulled her head back so she had
        to face the tiled wall. His other hand was cupped under her chin, his
        fingers invading her mouth. She was eager to suck them as if needing
        a counterbalance to his cock impaling her at the other end.  
      Time and again Alex thrust within her, his momentum building, while
        their entwined position remained unaltered until the inevitable shuddering,
        convulsing and simultaneous climax. 
      Alex tenderly kissed and caressed her, before slowly lifting himself
        from Kate&#146;s limp and sated body. Her hands were motionless, relaxed
        within their familiar cuffs. After using the phone to order tea for both
        of them, he retrieved Ray&#146;s key-ring from the table next to the
        sedated patient&#146;s bed. Kate heard the jangle of keys from behind
        her as Alex looked for the appropriate key for her cuffs. He didn&#146;t
        find it. Switching on the shower and setting a lukewarm temperature,
        he pushed Kate, still handcuffed into the shower. 
      Two minutes later he came back holding out a large towel, inviting the
        refreshed, satisfied and thoroughly soaked Kate to step into it. He rubbed
        her down briskly with the towel as a parent might with a child. Kate
        loved it, but tried not to show it. 
      &#147;Sorry that you can't dry yourself, it&#146;s just that I couldn&#146;t
        find the handcuff key on Ray&#146;s keyring.&#148; Alex apologized disingenuously,
        continuing to rub her. His hands were busy, thoroughly drying her pussy. &#147;You
        wouldn&#146;t happen to know what that key went?&#148; Kate felt his
        hand press heavily against her sex as if attempting to squeeze out a
        reply. 
      &#147;I&#146;ve no idea,&#148; Kate replied, bringing that line of questioning
        to a rapid conclusion. Dried off and feeling better than she had in a
        long time, Alex led Kate back to the main room, both guiltily relieved
        to observe that Ray remained sedated but stable. 
      LUCY 
      There was a gentle knock on the door. Without waiting for a response
        a pussy-girl entered the room with a tea tray. 
      Alex greeted her warmly. &#147;Thank you lucy, please put the tray down
        over there.&#148; 
      Lucy was all smiles and charm, her fine blonde hair pinned up, with
        wispy curls tousled downwards, sweetly framing her face. She was attired
        in an immaculate white dress with its tightly laced bodice and long full
        skirt. Although not big breasted, the bodice&#146;s square cut decolletage
        shaped the top of her breasts into something most alluring, a sight not
        missed by Alex as she bent down to pour tea into the two cups.  
      Kate was kneeling on the marble floor, naked and secured in her chains.
        She gazed at the pussy-girl with mixed feelings, almost like envy. 
      &#147;Did you remember the other thing I asked for?&#148; Alex asked
        Lucy. Dipping two fingers between her uplifted and squeezed breasts she
        pulled out and handed him a small envelope, curtsied respectfully and
        slipped quietly from the room. Master Alex had seen how Kate was studying
        every move of the pussy-girl.  
      He opened the envelope and took out two small keys and gestured for
        Kate to come closer to his chair, to sit with her back to him. He unlocked
        not just her handcuffs but also the thick leather collar she had worn
        for months. Without the familiar feel of the collar Kate felt truly naked,
        though the significance of being divested of the collar was not lost
        on her. 
      They both took a sip of Earl Grey tea from the cups. &#147;How would
        you like to become a pussy-girl, working here at The Lodge?&#148; Alex
        asked. &#147;You&#146;ll need to be undergo training of course, but you&#146;ll
        find it an improvement on your current status.&#148; 
      Kate&#146;s mind sprung into life. Out of Ray&#146;s awful accident
        had come the opportunity she had been looking for. &#147;Do I have a
        choice?&#148; 
      &#147;Absolutely. It&#146;s impossible to be a pussy-girl against your
        will. That&#146;s what bunnies are.&#148; He said with an indulgent chuckle.
        He seemed surprised that Kate hadn&#146;t figured that out. &#147;It&#146;s
        entirely your choice. Actually, I have in mind a special role for you,
        right here in the medical suite.&#148; 
      Kate&#146;s excitement at this suggestion was impossible to conceal.
        It meant she could continue to nurse Ray. &#147;What do I have to do?&#148; she
        said, trying hard to maintain a calm matter-of-fact tone of voice. 
      &#147;You must dress like a pussy-girl, act like a pussy-girl and think
        like a pussy-girl. You&#146;ve seen how they are always smiling, always
        obedient, and always trustworthy. I know that you bunnies think the pussy-girls
        have sold their souls to the devil, but the fact is they have a far better
        and more interesting life than the bunnies. I could set you a few tasks
        to test how you react to various situations. If that goes well you&#146;ll
        have a few weeks aptitude and etiquette training, and then you&#146;ll
        be a pussy-girl. You&#146;ll love it, I&#146;m sure.&#148; 
      Master Alex made a good salesman, although Kate had already decided
        to buy! It was time to start thinking like a pussy-girl... if that wasn&#146;t
        a contradiction in terms. 
      Leaning back, assuming the role of a psychoanalyst, Master Alex prepared
        to discuss something urgent with Kate. &#147;Tell me what happened today,
        and don&#146;t leave a damn thing out.&#148;  
      She told him everything. How the ponygirls returned to the beach for
        help, and she and Nancy went to the spot where Ray had fallen. Giggling,
        she explained about her hitting the whipper controls. Then, about how
        she found Ray, first fearing that he was dead.  
      Kate sensed that Master Alex had set a trap for her. He&#146;d seen
        the sling she made for Ray&#146;s arm and was certain to know it was
        from a parachute. She decided to come clean, sensing he would already
        have deduced that there was an intruder on the island. It was a female
        journalist, she casually informed him, but couldn&#146;t remember the
        name. 
      THE MISSING KEY 
      Master Alex&#146;s questioning was not done. &#147;Ray&#146;s keys...
        what happened to them?&#148; 
      Kate shifted nervously, still kneeling on the floor, aware of the nagging
        irritation from her stitches. &#147;Nancy and I had to unlock ourselves
        otherwise we&#146;d never have been about to lift Ray up. Nancy wanted
        to keep the keys but we - that journalist and I - managed to persuade
        her to let me take the keys and save her from getting in trouble. What&#146;s
        the problem? I gave Kurt the set of keys.&#148; 
      &#147;All except one key. I discovered it was missing while we were
        in the bathroom. Could bunny nancy or the journalist have had time to
        remove a key from the ring?&#148; 
      &#147;I guess so. We all held the key ring for at least a few moments.&#148; 
      Master Alex laughed. &#147;It seems our journalist lady has made a great
        start to her stay with us. Jesus Christ, she&#146;s already acquired
        a master key for everyone&#146;s handcuffs! Our festival starts in two
        days so this is damn bad timing. She&#146;ll get one hell of a story
        if we don&#146;t find her.&#148; 
      Showing newly acquired pussy-girl attitude, Kate agreed it really was
        bad timing, but it didn&#146;t feel like her problem. She was yawning,
        exhausted, sexually and emotionally drained by the events of the day.
        At any moment she expected to be collected by a handler and chained up
        in a cell, or perhaps even find herself being abused in a stranger&#146;s
        bed. But her thoughts were preempted. 
      &#147;Would you like to sleep in that bed tonight,&#148; Master Alex
        asked pointing to the adjacent bed in the room. &#147;I need to stay
        up a while, get some work done on the computer, and monitor Ray&#146;s
        progress for a few hours. I&#146;ll wake you up early and you can watch
        him while I get a little sleep.&#148; 
      He must have read her mind, though the way she had being eyeing up that
        comfortable bed for the last couple of hours, it wasn&#146;t difficult.
        Beckoning her to where he sat, he told her to turn around, and put handcuffs
        on her wrists. She laid out on the bed and Master Alex covered her with
        a sheet. 
      Suddenly, just before her brain shut down for the night, something came
        back to her. &#147;I remember the name now. Galtz, I think... Yeah, Karen
        Galtz.&#148; 
      Master Alex smiled. &#147;Hah! I know that name from somewhere.&#148; He
        seemed highly amused by that news. 
      He dimmed the lights and Kate was asleep in moments. 
      NANCY AND THE JOURNALIST 
      It was a distance of two miles from the scene of Ray&#146;s accident
        to the bunny camp on the beach. As they walked slowly along the trail
        Karen tried to make up for hitting Nancy on the head and putting her
        back in the cuffs, but there really wasn&#146;t anything she could do
        except apologize again. Nancy grudgingly accept. She was curious to know
        how and why the journalist came to Rabbit Island.
      &#147;You&#146;ve a tattoo of a rabbit on your inner thigh, haven&#146;t
        you?&#148; Karen stated. 
      &#147;That&#146;s true. We all have, and a number too.&#148; 
      &#147;There was a woman in the news recently. She had suffered a major
        memory loss and nobody has yet identified her.&#148; 
      &#147;...and she had a tattoo like mine?&#148; 
      &#147;Yes, similar. It&#146;s definitely a rabbit design. I interviewed
        her myself and she showed it to me.&#148; 
      &#147;So how did you know about this place? Surely we are somewhere
        in the middle of the South Asia Sea.&#148; 
      &#147;Let&#146;s just say I have a few connections with people who know
        about places like as this.&#148; 
      &#147;So what&#146;s your point?&#148; Nancy pressed. &#147;You already
        know that she came from or passed through here. You don&#146;t seem to
        want to help us escape, so why exactly are you here?&#148; 
      &#147;To see if it is true. To find out if they are amputating the arms
        from their ponygirls.&#148; 
      Nancy stopped walking, dead in her tracks. &#147;That&#146;s crazy.
        You&#146;ve seen the ponygirls for yourself. There are definitely arms
        in those harnesses. The people running this place may have some perverted
        ideas about sex and power but they are not crazy. They take good care
        of their ponygirls.&#148; 
      &#147;I&#146;m glad for your sake. If that&#146;s true, I&#146;ll take
        some photographs around the island tomorrow and then I&#146;m out of
        here.&#148; 
      &#147;By parachute?&#148; Nancy joked. 
      &#147;Fast powerboat actually. I chartered one to collect me at the
        jetty at midnight tomorrow. I still have a few other places to check
        out.&#148; 
      &#147;What? Other places like this?&#148; 
      &#147;Of course. You didn&#146;t think this place was unique did you?
        I&#146;ve heard it said that this is one of the better slave islands.
        Did you know that in some places they keep their girls in small cages,
        in dark basement cells? Other slavery organizations think Rabbit Island
        is a joke, far too soft, what with the bunnies, ponies and pussies.&#148; 
      &#147;You seem to know an awful lot.&#148; Nancy said, treating Karen&#146;s
        claims with scepticism. &#147;How did you come to know so much about
        this sordid business?&#148; 
      GALTZ EXPLAINS 
      &#147;Well, as you know I&#146;m a journalist and I&#146;ve always had
        a consuming interest in sex. A few years ago I got my first assignment
        covering the sex movie industry, I knew instantly I&#146;d found my niche.
        That assignment was about &#145;fluffers&#146;. That&#146;s what they
        call the women off-stage who keep the actors&#146; dicks hard when they
        make gang-bang movies. I decided to learn about it first hand, if you
        know what I mean...
      &#147;I wrote other articles about prostitution, sex clubs, weird fetishes...
        you name it! One time I had an article to do on glamour modelling and
        that led me into a bondage modelling shoot. The photographer persuaded
        me that I should let him tie me up for a double shot with the model.
        Well... I loved it. The next day I went back there and got tied up myself,
        and my pictures started to appear on the internet. The rope and gags
        turned me on so much I would have done the modelling for free. I&#146;ve
        been tied up in so many different ways I&#146;ve lost count... 
      &#147;Next, I answered an internet ad from a Dom who was looking for
        a legal 24/7 slave. I&#146;d seen a lot about such things and thought
        it would make a good story. So we signed a contract with a specialist
        lawyer and I did a three month stint as a real sex slave. The only condition
        was that I finished the three months without injury or disfigurement.
        That gave him an awful lot of latitude and he took it. Sometimes it was
        heaven and sometimes it was pure hell, but it was something I&#146;ll
        never forget... 
      &#147;By that stage I had my own syndicated magazine column and all
        sorts of gossip, information and contacts started to come my way. I started
        to learn about the existence of places like this... 
      &#147;My last assignment was a two week visit to a human pony farm in
        England. They were such nice people and it was great fun, but I thought
        it was ruined when the ponies were allowed to go to the pub with their
        masters in the evening. That&#146;s not what being a ponygirl is all
        about. The ponygirls on Rabbit Island are so much better!&#148; 
      &#147;But they are non-consensual!&#148; Nancy objected. 
      &#147;Exactly! And that is what allows them to fully experience being
        a human pony.&#148; 
      Nancy looked at the visitor as if she was mad. &#147;I have an idea.
        Why don&#146;t you take my place on the island? You can have the full
        Rabbit Island bunny experience and I&#146;ll return to the States!&#148; 
      &#147;I would, honey, but I&#146;m just too busy. I have publishing
        deadlines to meet. Besides, Rabbit Island doesn&#146;t accept consensuals
        any longer.&#148; 
      
         *** 
       
      Karen was one of those people who think there&#146;s something wrong
        if two people were together but not talking. &#147;Nancy, what&#146;s
        your favorite position?&#148; she said excitedly. 
      &#147;For sex?&#148; Nancy queried. 
      &#147;For bondage! You must have been tied up lots of ways since you
        arrived here. Which one do you like most?&#148; 
      Nancy paused. She thought of the one she disliked least. &#147;Ball-tie.
        Tied up in a neat little bundle and left alone in peace!&#148; 
      Karen was quick to offer her preference. &#147;Me, I like a hog-tie.
        Rope of course. Elbows tied and touching. Ankles all the way back to
        my wrists, and with a crotch rope naturally.&#148; 
      &#147;Naturally!&#148; Nancy repeated with a smirk. The normal bunny
        conversations were bad enough for the likes of Nancy, but this woman
        was even worse. 
      &#147;And I have to be gagged too!&#148; Karen continued excitedly. &#147;A
        ballgag, but not too large...and I prefer to be on the floor because
        I always worry about falling off a bed while I&#146;m squirming around.&#148; 
      THE CABIN 
      Despite, or perhaps because of, Karen&#146;s incessant conversation
        the walk back to the cabin seemed to take longer than Nancy expected. 
      Nancy made the introductions to the other bunnies. There seemed to be
        more and more reasons to hate the journalist: Self obsessed, arrogant,
        condescending, insensitive and violent! Although her handcuffs prevented
        her from touching it Nancy was convinced that there was a large bump
        on the side of her head. 
      While Ms Galtz held court over the other six bunnies, revelling in their
        fawning attention and admiration, Nancy sat a few yards away from the
        group, thinking of other matters as she often did. There was one thing
        about Karen that Nancy really, really liked. She had a speedboat taking
        her off Rabbit Island tomorrow night. 
      FRUSTRATED PONYGIRLS 
      When Ray was taken to the medical suite with Kate in close attendance,
        ponygirls Jessica and Debbie were led to the paddock area, still pulling
        the vacant trap behind them. Riccardo had invited the assembled guests
        to inspect his ponies, Linda and Karita, at close quarters.
      The half a dozen men and women approached the ponygirls almost in awe,
        hands tentatively touching the the numerous straps of the harnesses that
        securely embraced the ponygirls. Secure too, because of the six small
        padlocks that prevented their unauthorized removal. Some guests liked
        to caress their heads, still fixed with the bridle, as if petting an
        animal. Others liked to feel and admire the impressive muscularity of
        the ponygirl&#146;s sleek thighs, while others could not resist tugging
        on the rings in her nipples and labia, marvelling at well adapted to
        the rings the pony&#146;s flesh had become.  
      Throughout it all, despite their aching arms, tired legs, and smarting
        buttocks, the ponygirls remained noble and impassive, just as they were
        trained. Whilst much of the groping might not have been to a ponygirl&#146;s
        taste, the compliments most certainly were. There weren&#146;t many lady
        visitors to Rabbit Island who did not harbour a wistful desire to be
        a pony themselves, if only for a fleeting moment. 
      Riccardo led the orphaned ponygirls Jessica and Debbie to their tack
        room. Despite his kindly gestures he never said a word to them, though
        he could tell how troubled they were by the day&#146;s events. They seemed
        unable to keep still as Riccardo unlocked the remaining padlocks from
        their harnesses. As was the driver&#146;s custom he only released one
        of the ponies&#146; harnesses, leaving her remove her own bridle and
        bit and also unbuckle the other. 
      Jessica and Debbie walked into the main room of their quarters each
        carrying a large armful of leather straps which they dropped onto the
        floor next to a large table. Both were naked, as always when not in harness,
        and each had her pony&#146;s tail still swishing against her thighs as
        natural as if it were the real thing. For sanitary reasons they kept
        their tail/butt-plugs in place until they reached the bathroom. 
      LUCY TELLS JESSICA 
      It was a long and anxious wait for news on how their pony driver was
        doing. Pussy-girl Lucy gave them the best report later that evening.
      &#147;I just took some tea to the medical suite. Ray is doing okay.
        He&#146;s injured but they say it&#146;s nothing to worry about. Master
        Alex and bunny kate are doing okay too.&#148; She added mischievously. 
      The meaning of the pussy-girl&#146;s words wasn&#146;t lost on Jessica.
        Her best friend and Master Alex had been working together. She was pleased
        for Kate, yet couldn&#146;t stop herself from feeling jealous. Jealous
        of both of them. She hated herself for it, and hated being left on the
        periphery of events. Ponygirls were always so close to the action but
        were seldom at the centre of it. Everything happened just outside of
        their blinkered vision. It was as if they were constantly shielded from
        human affairs. 
      A dark cloud had blown in and settled above her. Not even her fellow
        ponygirls could lift Jessica from the depression she had fallen into.
        She and Debbie sat diligently cleaning their harnesses as they did every
        night, but the conversation of six off-duty ponygirls wasn&#146;t full
        of the normal joking and teasing. 
      &#147;What you need,&#148; Debbie declared, putting down her newly cleaned
        boot, &#147;is a good, hard fuck!&#148; 
      Jessica laughed. She hadn&#146;t had sex with a man or a woman for five
        days. No wonder she was feeling frustrated. &#147;Yeah, I can never find
        one when I need one. Can I order one from room-service?&#148; 
      They all laughed and carried on with the polishing. Her joke may have
        made the mood a little lighter but Jessica&#146;s blues remained. 
      NIGHT DUTY 
      Soon after the ponygirls had finished polishing their tack Erik appeared
        outside the barred door that connected the pony quarters with the Lodge.
        He had a piece of paper in his hand, reading it to himself while looking
        over the group of naked ponygirls. 
      &#147;Jessica needs a good hard fuck!&#148; Ponygirl Linda called out
        to him. 
      Flushed with embarrassment, Jessica slapped her on the arm. &#147;Shush!
        You are such a troublemaker!&#148; 
      Erik smirked, and continued to study the paper. 
      &#147;Okay, Linda and karita. You&#146;ll be doing a little double act,
        a pussy-girl will be along shortly to dress you. Debbie, you&#146;ll
        be having a lot of fun. You like needles and clamps, don&#146;t you?
        And Jessica... come with me now. 
      She stood up, walked the few yards to the vertical-barred door where
        Erik waited. She turned around so her back was against the bars. In the
        door was a square gap in the bars at waist height. Jessica held her hands
        together behind her and felt the click of Erik&#146;s handcuffs around
        them. He blindfolded her, just as she expected. She turned again to face
        the bars as Erik instructed. He clipped the ends of a thick chain to
        her nipple rings, creating a shallow arc of chain between them. Jessica
        could feel its weight pulling down on her nipples. &#147;Just a little
        decorative touch. Or maybe something to hold on to you by.&#148; Erik
        explained. 
      The barred door opened briefly and Jessica was removed. Erik held her
        firmly by the elbow, and escorted her along familiar corridors. She recognised
        the echoes of the walls and the feel of the flooring, whether it was
        marble, flagstone, or wood veneer. Like all the other bunnies and ponies
        she&#146;d never seen these corridors because they were always blindfolded
        when walking through them. She always wondered what it was they didn&#146;t
        want her to see. The answer would be a disappointment. 
      A GOOD HARD FUCK 
      Erik took Jessica outside into the sultry night air, much to her surprise.
        It was noisy with crickets chirping as it invariably was. 
      &#147;Will this one be okay?&#148; Erik asked somebody. 
      &#147;Looks alright to me,&#148; said a husky voice. He sounded like
        a large man. 
      &#147;She&#146;s a ponygirl. Nice strong body. Good temperament, but
        she will fight back and escape if she gets half a chance. 
      &#147;No problem. I like &#145;em with a bit of fight in them.&#148; 
      Jessica felt his hand grip her arm as Erik&#146;s had done, but with
        twice the strength. 
      They were walking on the grass. Not strolling, but at a purposeful pace. &#147;What&#146;s
        your name?&#148; Jessica asked the stranger.  
      &#147;Did I say you could speak, bitch?&#148; 
      &#147;No Sir. I&#146;m sorry Master.&#148; 
      Jessica started to be concerned about the stranger. The further away
        from The Lodge they got the tighter was the grip on her arm. She guessed
        they were at the far end of the back lawn, near the spread-eagle and
        suspension frames. 
      Suddenly he grabbed her breasts in his hands, squeezing hard for his
        own pleasure. His thumbs rubbed coarsely over her nipples, while the
        chain than connected her nipple rings rattled in response to his rough
        handling. 
      &#147;On your knees!&quot; 
      Jessica complied immediately and heard the unzipping of the man&#146;s
        pants. 
      &#147;Open your mouth!&#148; 
      She did so, and was not surprised by what was soon pushing past her
        lips, making her open her mouth even wider to accommodate it. 
      &#147;Cock-sucking whore.&#148; he muttered, as if involuntarily. &#147;Keep
        sucking bitch.&#148; 
      Jessica, half scared and half-excited by this new encounter, did as
        she was told, even as the thick penis continued to grow within her. His
        large hand pressed on the back of her head pushing her into his crotch.
        His other hand held the nipple chain and had it wrapped around his fist,
        pulling violently on Jessica&#146;s nipples. 
      Suddenly he pulled Jessica off his cock and pushed her to the ground.
        Handcuffed and blindfolded, it wasn&#146;t a fair fight as he wrestled
        her onto her belly, then sat astride her, his weight grinding her pelvis
        into the grass. Jessica kicked backwards with her legs, determined to
        at least put up a fight. The man laughed, enjoying her struggling beneath
        him. 
      &#147;Whoa! They said you were a feisty one!&#148; 
      &#147;I don&#146;t... like... being... raped.&#148; Jessica grunted
        out. 
      &quot;Maybe you just like to fight beforehand? Then you don&#146;t feel
        so guilty.&#148; 
      &#147;Bullshit!&#148; 
       He took one of her ankles, wrapped it with rope and tied it to an iron
        ring which was cemented into the ground for that very purpose. Her other
        ankle received the same treatment leaving them spread well apart. The
        man&#146;s hand found her sex exposed and inviting. His thick fingers
        probed, brushing against the labia rings. They came out wet. He wiped
        them across Jessica&#146;s bare buttocks. 
      &#147;Can you feel that? That&#146;s your juice. You love it like this.&#148; He
        spanked her buttocks several times with hard stinging blows. 
      &#147;You fucking bastard!&#148; 
      He laughed, not in the least upset or annoyed by her outbursts. It was
        all part of their fight as far as he was concerned. To her surprise she
        felt him unlocking her handcuffs, which prompted another round of wrestling
        as he tied her wrists to the other spread-eagle securing points. 
      Jessica was left cursing and struggling frustratedly against the ropes,
        which were slack enough for her to raise herself up on her hands and
        knees but were still inescapable. 
      &#147;It&#146;s been nice talking to you, but now it&#146;s time to
        make love, or rape, if you prefer. Would you like to open your mouth
        for a gag now, or shall I make you open it?&#148; 
      She opened up and immediately felt a rubber ball passing between her
        lips. The man tugged deliberately hard as he buckled the strap behind
        her head. Pegged out on the ground like a helpless sacrificial lamb Jessica
        waited, trembling in anticipation, as the man got ready to take her. 
      And take her, he did, for the next half hour. Neither her vagina nor
        her ass was spared as his oversized member thrust deep into her belly.
        The more she struggled the more he seemed to like it; and the harder
        he became, the harder he pushed. By the end of his assault Jessica was
        flattened out on the grass, exhausted, with his heavy body resting like
        a conquering power on top of her. 
      She needed a good hard fuck and she&#146;d got one. And yes, she did
        feel better for it, although the sleeping body on top of her was beginning
        to feel awfully heavy. Almost as heavy as her heart.

          Chapter 6. In the Doghouse 
          (Even Ponygirls Sometimes Get the Blues, Aurelius)

        (Ch. 5) Kate proves her nursing skills. Jessica suffers from Ponygirl
        Blues.
      THE MEDICAL SUITE 
      &#147;Kate, it&#146;s your turn to watch Ray while I get some sleep.&#148; Master
        Alex whispered, shaking Kate gently from her sleep. It was 4 am. 
      &#147;Uh? W-w-what?&#148; Kate sleepily replied, her eyes barely open. &#147;Ray...
        Yes... I&#146;ll watch him now.&#148; 
      Master Alex helped Kate to her feet and led her to a chair next to Ray&#146;s
        bed chaining her cuffs to its wooden backrest. &#147;Just call out if
        you need me,&#148; he said sleepily, stripping off and falling into the
        warm bed Kate had vacated. 
      Kate sat in the instrument-illuminated darkness, contentedly watching
        over Ray, listening to his breathing, and occasional snores from Master
        Alex. The air-conditioning was slightly cool for her naked skin. Although
        her nipples were still secured within their metal hats she knew that
        they were hard, expanding fully in their little housings. How nice it
        would have been, she thought, to quietly play with herself while watching
        the two men sleep. But the cuffs locking her hands to the chair&#146;s
        back denied her that simple pleasure. It had a double purpose, denying
        not just her escape, but her pleasure too.  
      They couldn&#146;t restrain her thoughts however. Those thoughts were
        not of escape and freedom but of the previous night when Alex had taken
        her across the toilet seat. She shivered with pleasure at the recollection,
        frustrated that she was unable to attend to her pussy&#146;s sudden need
        to be touched. 
      Behind her, with its fan still humming, was the computer from which
        Master Alex had tapped into invaluable medical advice. Its internet access,
        connecting the island the outside world, did not escape her notice. Smiling
        to herself, Kate wondered whether she might be permitted to check her
        email. Probably not, she conceded. 
      TOAST 
      Pedro the milkman arrived at the medical suite around eight in the morning,
        prior to embarking on his usual round of the island. He was a man that
        Kate was always glad to see - the only one that could relieve the weight
        of her growing breasts. Master Alex brought Pedro up to date with developments
        regarding Kate; although there was little that the milkman hadn&#146;t
        already heard through the grapevine. 
      Pussy-girls, Pedro knew, could not stay in lactation. He said he was
        disappointed to lose a &#145;young and promising milker&#146; - a comment
        that caused Kate to smile. He muttered pessimistically to Alex about
        not being able to meet his yield projections. 
      Kate assumed her usual milking position on the floor, legs crossed with
        the receptacle nestling between her thighs. Pedro quickly tied her ankles
        together with a leather strap, out of habit rather than necessity. Next
        came the part that all the milkmaids loved - when Pedro clipped through
        the wires that fastened the nipple caps to their breasts and pulled the
        wire out of the piercing. After cleaning each nipple with an antiseptic
        wipe, giving them quick &#145;wake-up&#146; squeeze, he attached the
        suction pumps. 
      The electric motor hummed into life. Kate sat back and relaxed, enjoying
        the feel of the sucking action on her breasts and the way it permeated
        down to her sex. Contentedly she watched her milk leaving her body and
        collecting in the clear pouch that nestled between her calves and her
        protruding mound. Pedro switched off the machine sooner than Kate expected,
        much to her disappointment. Surely, she thought, he must have known there
        was still more milk left in her breasts! 
      Shortly after her milking Kate was enjoying a light breakfast by herself
        in the medical suite. Enjoying would be an understatement; the joy of
        being able to use a real knife to butter her toast was almost overwhelming.
        Although alone and unfettered she knew she was being watched by the CCTV
        so was on her best behavior. It was obviously a test, although sitting
        down enjoying a nice breakfast was not a difficult challenge. 
      She heard the noise of pony-boot bells, a sound that always perked up
        a bunny because it signalled that feeding time was imminent. She laughed
        to herself when she noticed her mouth watered even though breakfast was
        on a tray in front of her. A Pavlovian response, Jessica had once told
        her. Something to do with dogs apparently. 
      Looking out the window, she recognized Frank and his ponies, Sandra
        and Cathy. They were not on the breakfast run, but were returning from
        the jetty. Sitting alongside Frank was Dr. Schmidt. 
      Master Alex had mentioned that Dr Schmidt would be back at the Lodge
        during the morning but Kate hadn&#146;t expected it to be so soon. Suddenly
        her appetite had gone. The remains of the toast remained uneaten. Had
        she really diagnosed Ray&#146;s injuries correctly? Was his broken arm
        properly set? She feared if the doctor disapproved of her performance
        she would be thrown into the punishment cells. 
      The doctor breezed in and after a quick greeting he commenced questioning
        Master Alex about Ray&#146;s condition and treatment. Alex did his best
        to explain; sometimes failing to find the right terms, so Kate interjected
        periodically until it was she giving the patient&#146;s history. Despite
        Kate&#146;s occasionally nervous explanations the doctor seemed satisfied
        with Ray&#146;s treatment thus far, bringing a sigh of relief from both
        her and Master Alex. 
      Kate's brief role as a nurse had ended with the Doctor&#146;s arrival.
        Handlers came to take her from the medical suite. She was taken to a
        plain, very bright room bathed in diffused natural light. The only thing
        in the room was a simple wooden chair with a high back and no arms. She
        sat down on it and looked around the empty room. She was alone, and what&#146;s
        more she wasn&#146;t chained or tied up in any way, her sex was free
        of the chastity belt, her nipples finally released from the metal caps
        that signified her milk belonged to others. It was as if she had been
        given back her body. Her hands soon found there way to those parts so
        long denied them. Just to feel her nipples and labia with her fingers
        was wonderful. If this was her only reward for rescuing Ray then it was
        worth it. 
      KATE BONDS WITH PUSSY-GIRLS 
      The door opened and Kate guiltily returned her probing fingers to her
        lap. Two pussy-girls and Kurt, one of the senior handlers, entered, making
        Kate feel outnumbered as well as under-dressed. As usual the pussy-girls
        were immaculate in their long white dresses with their tightly laced
        bodices. Kate saw that each girl carried coils of soft white rope, and
        knew that she would soon be wearing it. 
      While Kurt stood to the side offering quiet advice, the pussy-girls
        secured Kate&#146;s wrists and ankles to the chair; ankles tied to each
        front leg and each wrist to the rear ones. A half-dozen tight wraps of
        rope on each limb then more bands tight around her waist and the chair-back
        ensured that Kate was going nowhere.  
      It was the way the pussy-girls looked at her body as they worked that
        made Kate sense that their task was not merely to tie her up. Lucy rubbed
        some shaving foam on Kate&#146;s pubic hair. Her light growth was dealt
        with by a few rapid strokes of the razor, before being wiped clean with
        a tissue. 
      The pussy-girls knelt one to each side of her, their hands reaching
        to explore her body. Fingers soon found their way into Kate&#146;s easily
        accessible pussy. She tugged anxiously against her bonds anxiously. Something
        about this didn&#146;t seem right. Initially it seemed like a little
        harmless girl-on-girl action, quite sensuous as each pussy-girl&#146;s
        lips started planting delicate kisses on her thighs. By the time their
        lips were against her ribs Kate began to worry about where it was leading. 
      &#147;No!&#148; Kate gasped as the two pussy-girl mouths captured her
        nipples. &#147;No, this isn&#146;t right. It&#146;s not natural,&#148; she
        pleaded, even as the milk was being teased through the ducts in her nipples.
        Unlike the impersonal suction of the milking machine she could feel demanding
        and insistent lips and teeth, sucking and nipping, greedily taking their
        fill from her breasts. 
      Kate&#146;s tears trickled down her cheeks. &#147;Please stop. I don&#146;t
        like this,&#148; she snuffled, her teary eyes pleading with Kurt; but
        the suckling continued relentlessly. Kurt stepped behind the chair, stroking
        Kate&#146;s hair as if to comfort her. Then his hands cupped and squeezed
        her breasts to further stimulate the milk&#146;s flow. 
      When the pussy-girls&#146; mouths finally released their grip on her
        teats Kurt&#146;s fingers were there to take their place. He squeezed
        both at the same time, squirting Kate&#146;s milk onto the face and chest
        of each pussy-girl. They both laughed and licked their lips.  
      &#147;C&#146;mon katie girl,&#148; Lucy said sympathetically, &#147;cheer
        up. It&#146;s nothing to get upset about!&#148; She dabbed the tears
        from Kate&#146;s eyes with a white handkerchief before applying it to
        the splashes of milk on the top of her breast. 
      After the poor attitude and ungenerous spirit Kate had shown, Master
        Kurt gave her a severe lecture. She was still bound to the chair while
        he paced around menacingly around her, criticizing, cajoling, and browbeating
        her until she was once again in tears. 
      &#147;I want to go back to the beach!&#148; Kate cried, her tears splashing
        onto her bare breasts. 
      &#147;No you don&#146;t.&#148; 
      &#147;I do. I don&#146;t want to stay at here any more. I couldn&#146;t
        bear to be a pussy-girl.&#148; 
      Master Kurt laughed heartily, as if to ridicule her. &#147;Bunny kate.
        Do you really think you can pick and choose where you go every time something
        displeases you? Are we are here for your convenience? You will complete
        the remainder of the pussy-girl trial, like it or not. Failing that,
        we could accommodate you in the cells for a few weeks. With the start
        of the festival some fresh meat in the cells is always useful, but I
        don&#146;t think you like that at all. 
      Kate knew that was true. When couple of dozen rich, sadistic perverts
        from around the world landed on Rabbit Island the cells were the worst
        place to be. It was as if each cell door had a sign on it saying &#145;hurt
        me&#146;. 
      The ever-reliable Erik arrived in the room to interrupt Kurt&#146;s
        inelegant pep talk. Kate&#146;s next appointment awaited her. 
      After being untied from the chair Kate was cuffed and hooded, then frog-marched
        through the seemingly endless corridors of The Lodge. They entered a
        room which had a distinctive echo. She was made to kneel down on the
        cool tiled floor. It was a public bathroom. 
      THE MEN&#146;S ROOM 
      The hood was lifted off Kate&#146;s head, revealing to her a row of
        toilet cubicles on the other side of the tiled room. To her left and
        right were several men&#146;s urinals; alongside those, towards the door,
        were washbasins. With its hardwood fittings and marble surfaces, Kate
        observed that it was a very elegant place, the kind of washroom seen
        in a five star hotel. 
      Directly between her kneeling legs there was a small drain hole in the
        tiled floor. She realized that her position in the rest room was as much
        part of the design as any other fixture there. 
      Behind her Kurt and Erik were busy fitting Kate&#146;s arms and neck
        into a stainless steel frame, adjusting the height of the vertical pole
        so that two semi-circular arms could be closed in on each side of her
        neck. They joined and overlapped to create a hasp and staple so that
        it could be secured with a padlock at her throat. Kate&#146;s upper arms
        and wrists were fitted with similar clamps on the sides of the vertical
        pole. Clamps, she noted, not mere shackles, which left her wrists and
        elbows completely immobilized. 
      Kate was also fitted with ankle shackles, their chain passing behind
        the vertical bar to ensure she would remain kneeling on her shins. She
        looked around the room, just able to turn her neck within the rigid stainless
        steel collar. Looking down was not so easy; she could just barely catch
        sight of her nipples if she puffed out her chest. 
      Just as Kurt and Erik were leaving, pussy-girl Lucy entered the bathroom
        carrying a make-up bag. Kate found it a humiliating experience having
        someone else slapping make-up on her, as if she was somebody&#146;s little
        toy. But that is exactly what she was. After applying a glossy red to
        Kate&#146;s lips, black and lustrous blue on her eyes the pussy girl
        brushed Kate&#146;s unkempt hair and pulled it into a high ponytail to
        keep it off her shoulders and face. 
      &#147;See. You look much nicer now!&#148; Lucy said, evidently pleased
        with her efforts. She held a tiny mirror a foot in front of Kate&#146;s
        eyes. Kate studied the face in the mirror and had to agree. It was only
        good manners to thank the pussy-girl. 
      &#147;Just because men are pissing on you, doesn&#146;t mean you shouldn&#146;t
        look your best.&#148; Lucy stated, wagging her finger. Very true, thought
        Kate, that&#146;s a good motto for life too! 
      &#147;Remember Katie - always be nice to the men. Stay cheerful. Chat
        to them; show them that you appreciate their pissing on you. It really
        doesn&#146;t hurt. You&#146;ll find most men will be very courteous towards
        you. Perhaps it&#146;s because they feel a little guilty, or maybe it
        just seems odd having a woman in their men-only space. Oh, and whatever
        you do, don&#146;t laugh at the ones with small dicks!&#148; 
      Kate smirked, happy to share the joke and glad of the advice. 
      Pussy-girl lucy gathered up her things and headed for the door. &#147;I&#146;ll
        be back in an hour to hose you down. That&#146;s a promise.&#148; 
      Kate was still adjusting to the vice-like grip of the urinal device
        when her first customer arrived. 
      &#147;Good morning, Sir.&#148; She called out to the man, determined
        to impress from the start. 
      The man, quite young and handsome and well groomed in a preppy way,
        was sheepishly looking around for a urinal to use but discovered yellow
        tape stretched across them to indicate they were out of order. 
      He returned her greeting, having realized that he was expected to urinate
        on the pretty blonde girl. He unzipped his fly and pulled out his flaccid
        cock in front of Kate&#146;s eyes. She involuntarily swallowed with nerves
        and closed her eyes tightly. He looked at the wall above Kate&#146;s
        head and read the sign. 
      &#147;Gentleman. We respectfully ask that you  
        aim below the collar. A full range of   
        water sports is available in the cells. Please   
        contact the cell block supervisor.&#148; 
      He watched Kate&#146;s full round breasts rise and fall with her breath,
        then aimed his piss gently splashing onto them. Instead of recoiling
        Kate seemed to puff out her chest as if to catch the flow. He was glad
        that this beautiful girl kept her eyes closed and liked the way the pale
        yellow urine streaked down her slim belly and onto her sex, to make it
        seem as if she was pissing with him. 
      When the flow stopped Kate tentatively opened her eyes and saw the man
        was zipping up his pants. &#147;You have lovely breasts. Too good for
        peeing on... I mean...not just your breasts...you as well...you&#146;re
        very pretty. Will you be here later?&#148; he asked, bumbling like an
        American Hugh Grant. At least a few hours she told him, but she didn&#146;t
        know for sure. 
      Kate sensed she had an admirer. It wasn&#146;t to be the last. There
        was something about a pretty girl in a urinal that made men fall in love
        with her. 
      &#147;Hey Katie! How are you doing?&#148; Lucy asked, breezing into
        the restroom an hour later. As promised she had her bucket and sponge
        and went to work rubbing vigorously on Kate&#146;s breasts, belly and
        pudenda. Kate&#146;s face was still dry and her make up immaculate. 
      &#147;Been busy?&#148; Lucy asked as she continued to rub. 
      &#147;Ten, maybe twelve guys. They were no problem at all; but Lucy,
        my arms are aching terribly. Can&#146;t you loosen my elbows just a little?&#148; 
      &#147;Can&#146;t do, sis! They&#146;re all locked in place. You just
        have to get used to it.&#148; Lucy switched on a hose and sprayed Kate
        with cold water, causing her to shriek at the sudden chill. It rinsed
        all the soapsuds from her body. A brisk rub down with a towel left Kate
        ready for the next hour and the rest of the day. 
      BREAKFAST AT THE BUNNY CAMP 
      Karen Galtz watched from a safe distance as the bunnies were fed their
        breakfast. The seven remaining after Kate&#146;s departure were kneeling
        along both sides of the long stainless steel tray long before the pony
        driver had arrived. The journalist&#146;s zoom lens captured some great
        images: weak-willed women, utterly subservient to their masters, reduced
        to eating from a trough like farm animals. She sensed a great article
        in the making, with one of her photos as the magazine&#146;s cover shot.
        Her zoom lens gave her a great view, but she was too far away to hear
        the conversation between the ponygirl driver and the bunnies. 
      When the coast was clear, the ponies and driver departed, and bunnies
        milling around after breakfast, Karen emerged from her cover a hundred
        metres away. 
      &#147;Did he ask about me?&#148; Karen asked Nancy. 
      &#147;No. Why would anybody know you are here? It was Kate and me that
        rescued Ray. She may be a little attached to the guy but she&#146;s not
        the type to open her mouth.&#148; 
      The journalist breathed a sigh of relief. It meant she could have a
        good look around the island, take some more photos and jump on her midnight
        boat back to civilization. It was all going so well. 
      BEACH SOCCER 
      Something that Karen wasn&#146;t expecting was to see was a bunny kicking
        a soccer ball along the beach. &#147;Can you play?&#148; Nancy asked. 
      &#147;A little.&#148; Galtz replied reticently. She didn&#146;t see
        any need to tell them she was the star striker for her college team. 
      &#147;Great. As you may have noticed we are one player short this morning.
        You&#146;ll have to play in bare feet of course.&#148; 
      &#147;Sure!&#148; Karen agreed, removing her hiking boots and socks
        and placing them tidily alongside her camera case. The rest of her possessions
        were in her rucksack, hidden alongside the trail when she was walking
        with Nancy the previous night. Though bare-footed, at least she was still
        wearing her khaki shirt and shorts. The bunnies envied her clothing.
        It was obvious from the way they looked. 
      &#147;Oh, and one more thing,&#148; Nancy added, as if she&#146;d almost
        forgotten, &#147;it&#146;s only fair that your hands are tied while you
        play.&#148; 
      Ms Galtz couldn&#146;t very well object, knowing what an advantage she
        would have otherwise. Sumi, the Korean bunny held a short length of frayed
        rope, washed ashore from a fishing boat. Sumi&#146;s dexterity surprised
        the journalist. She managed to knot the rope, despite her own wrists
        being cuffed behind her. &#147;Is that all right for you?&#148; Sumi
        asked, concerned that it was too tight. 
      Ms Galtz tugged gently at her wrists. &#147;It&#146;s fine,&#148; she
        confirmed, more worried about keeping such a small piece of rope in place
        than escaping from it. 
      The day&#146;s teams were agreed and the local rules explained to the
        visitor before they kicked off. Once she got the feel of the ball Ms
        Galtz started putting her skills to the test, but her unnecessary showing
        off didn&#146;t endear her to either her opponents or her team-mates.. 
      It wasn&#146;t long before a well-timed shoulder charge from one of
        the bunnies sent Galtz flying head first, collecting a mouthful of sand
        as she landed. She tugged on her wrists expecting to break free of the
        little piece of rope that held them. She tugged a few more times then
        strained to move her wrists to one side so she could see them over her
        shoulder. Her wrists, she was surprised to see, were fixed as surely
        as if they were in handcuffs. She laughed at the absurdity of being tied
        up by a woman that was herself in handcuffs! Galtz liked the occasional
        bondage session, particularly with other women so really didn&#146;t
        mind her predicament, knowing that she&#146;d be untied as soon as the
        soccer game finished. The sunshine, pretty girls everywhere, the feel
        of the sand between her toes, soccer and bondage at the same time - it
        was actually a lot of fun. 
      GREAT SHOT! 
      It was when Ms Galtz was on the verge of scoring her fifth goal that
        she appeared to stumble, mis-kicking the ball as if she had no coordination
        at all, then collapsing like a felled deer in the sand. Just yards from
        the goal, the soccer ball beside her, Ms Galtz lay moaning in semi-unconsciousness
        with the seven naked bunnies surrounding her. A small tranquilizer dart
        was stuck in her shoulder. 
      &#147;Sorry to ruin the game, girls,&#148; a voice called out behind
        them. Two handlers arrived on the scene, one holding a rifle. Masters
        Tony and Vince were well known to all the bunnies. 
      &#147;You don&#146;t get commission for this,&#148; Tony joked to Nancy. 
      &#147;I don&#146;t care. You can have this one for nothing.&#148; 
      &#147;Great shot, Tony.&#148; Vince said, kneeling down to inspect dart&#146;s
        entry point. &#147;Let&#146;s get her bound up. Riccardo should be here
        any time now.&#148; 
      Using the thin leather strips that are also used for the ponygirls reins,
        they started to bind her. Nancy stood and watched. &#147;She told me
        how she loves a really tight hog-tie,&#148; she gleefully informed the
        handlers. 
      &#147;She&#146;s in luck, bunny nancy, that&#146;s my specialty as you
        know only too well!&#148; Tony winked at her while lashing Galtz&#146;s
        elbows together. For Tony there were just two kinds of women in the world:
        those that could be bound with their elbows touching and those that couldn&#146;t.
        He was pleased to discover that Ms Galtz was one of the former. 
      The two handlers bent the journalist&#146;s legs back to her waist and
        tucked the long trailing cords from her ankles under the crossed wrist
        tie. Tony pulled the slack from the cords while the other handler lifted
        Galtz&#146;s knees. It helped bring her ankles and wrists even closer
        together. A couple more loops were done to ensure a strong union of hands
        and feet then the trailing end of the ankle cord was tied off at her
        tightly bound elbows.  
      They had just fitted her with a ballgag when Ms Galtz was groggily returning
        to consciousness. She lifted her head from the sand and saw a pair of
        slim feminine legs in front of her. Craning her neck upwards, past the
        plastic cover over the woman&#146;s sex and the straps that held it on,
        were small conical shaped breasts with their prominent nipples, and above
        them was Nancy&#146;s smiling face. 
      &#147;Is that tight enough for ya? I told them how you like your hog-ties
        good and tight!&#148; Nancy&#146;s pleasure was further enhanced by the
        sight of Ms Galtz squirming helplessly in the sand at her feet, pain
        etched on her face, fury at her betrayal evident behind her tears. 
      The harmonious jingle of pony-boot bells signaled the impending arrival
        of Riccardo and his ponygirls. Tony slipped the gun barrel under Ms Galtz&#146;s
        elbow and wrist bonds. Vince gripped it, then they lifted, with Ms Galtz
        dangling helplessly beneath it. It was the easiest way to carry a hog-tied
        woman. 
      The bunnies followed the handlers to the pony trap, watching as they
        heaved Ms Galtz up onto the small trailer. While they were securing Karen
        Galtz in position, Riccardo inspected his ponygirls; watering them and
        wiping them with a towel on what was already turning into a sweltering
        day. The bunnies gathered around him, regaling him with the story of
        the soccer match and how suddenly Ms Galtz tumbled to the ground after
        being shot. Riccardo laughed, amused at their betrayal of another female.
        There was another reason for the bunnies gathering around the pony driver:
        As usual Riccardo had a little treat for the bunnies, tossing grapes
        from a paper bag for whoever could catch one in her mouth. 
      The two hunters stood by as the ponygirls strained to get their load
        moving, leaning gently against the back of the trailer to ease them into
        motion. 
      Nancy watched the pony trap disappear down the track, feeling just a
        little guilty about betraying the journalist. But then she smiled inwardly
        - tonight, at midnight, she would board a boat taking her away from Rabbit
        Island forever. 
      KEY HOLES 
      &#147;What are you looking so pleased about?&#148; Tony said, snapping
        Nancy out of her reverie. &#147;Open your mouth and stick out your tongue!&#148; 
      He snapped a surgical latex glove on his hand and poked his fingers
        in Nancy&#146;s mouth probing around the gums, pressing deep into her
        cheeks, and toying with her large tongue stud. She&#146;d had a tongue
        stud since her mid-teens but they&#146;d replaced it with a bigger one
        when she arrived six months ago. The large metal ball on her tongue served
        as a constant humiliating reminder of her slavery. 
      Nancy hardly noticed as Tony slipped a pill on the back of her tongue
        as he searched her mouth. She swallowed, unaware that a powerful emetic
        was on its way to her stomach. 
      &#147;Um... what&#146;s going on?&#148; Nancy asked, looking mystified
        as they placed a bucket on the sand in front of her. 
      &#147;We&#146;re looking for a key. Unless you tell us where it is we&#146;ll
        have to continue your cavity search.&#148; 
      &#147;A key? What key? I don&#146;t know what you&#146;re talking about!
        What&#146;s the bucket for?&#148; 
      &#147;You&#146;ll find out very soon. It&#146;s probably best if you
        kneel down now.&#148; 
      Nancy&#146;s stomach was already rumbling as she knelt by the bucket.
        She burped a foul-tasting gas and was becoming nauseous. &#147;I feel
        sick,&#148; she said quietly, failing to win any sympathy. The men stood
        by, waiting for the inevitable to happen. 
      She burped again. Her whole body seemed to gulp, then the liquefied
        contents of her belly gushed from her mouth and into the bucket. She
        gasped a huge desperate breath then wretched several more times. Groaning
        and exhausted, Nancy leant over the bucket, her face turned a ghostly
        white. 
      Tony held the ends of two twigs in his fist. Vince studied them briefly
        and picked one. He didn&#146;t seem happy with his choice. Tony revealed
        the remaining twig, which was much longer than the one Vince had taken. 
      Without a word spoken Vince checked the contents of the bucket with
        his hand while Tony gave Nancy some water. 
      &#147;The search continues...&#148; Vince announced wiping clean his
        hand and chucking away the contents of the bucket. 
      Nancy had barely begun to recover when they lifted her to her feet and
        escorted her to the nearby whipping post. Vince fixed leather suspension
        cuffs around her ankles then each man lifted each ankle clipping them
        to sturdy rings on each side of the thick post. Nancy&#146;s ankles were
        at shoulder height, slightly apart like a narrow V, while her cuffed
        hands and upper back rested on the sand. 
      &#147;I swear I don&#146;t know anything about a key!&#148; Nancy protested
        weakly, looking upwards at her tormentors. &#147;It must have been the
        journalist that took it...or Kate. What about bunny kate?&#148; 
      &#147;Maybe... but our job is to check you. You&#146;re the prime suspect.&#148; Tony
        started to unlock the webbing straps of Nancy&#146;s chastity device,
        which in other circumstances she might have been glad about. 
      &#147;We&#146;ll start with a vaginal douche.&#148; 
      He removed the pre-packed kit from its clear plastic wrapper and hung
        the liquid pouch from the top of the post. Pressing the shield firmly
        over her sex he released the clip on the tube. 
      &#147;Doesn&#146;t hurt, does it, nancy?&#148; 
      It didn&#146;t. Nancy lay quietly, sensing the fullness of the tepid
        liquid within her. That was until the fullness became a painful cramping
        and a stretch that she&#146;d never known before. She was still too weak
        from her puking to protest. 
      Several minutes later they let her down from the whipping post, collecting
        the douche water in the cleaned-out bucket. She shared the handlers&#146; disappointment
        that a key was not discovered, even though it would have been a hell
        of a shock if they had found one! 
      Leaving Nancy laying miserable and exhausted on the sand, the handlers
        took a quick cigarette break and radioed back to The Lodge with their
        progress so far. 
      Cigarettes extinguished, they hauled Nancy&#146;s exhausted body onto
        her feet, lifting her cuffed hands to head height behind her, thus compelling
        her to bend forward at the waist. Weak and subdued, she allowed her cuffed
        wrists to take more of her weight than was advisable and received a stinging
        slap on her thigh as a result. 
      &#147;Stand up properly, nancy!&#148; Tony commanded. She slowly gathered
        herself, redistributing the weight back on to her feet and off her straining
        shoulders.  
      It wasn&#146;t just Nancy&#146;s wrists that were attached to the iron
        ring at the top of the post; a large plastic pouch containing an enema
        solution also hung down, ready for action. Behind her Tony was preparing
        the enema nozzle, his finger coating it well with a jelly lubricant.
        The double-bulb nozzle was well suited for today&#146;s purpose. 
      Nancy winced at the pain as she felt her sphincter opened by the invading
        enema nozzle until it contracted again, divided the nozzle&#146;s inner
        bulb from its outer one. Tony squeezed the little pump in the palm of
        his hand, watching the outer bulb inflate while Nancy felt the inner
        bulb pushing insistently against her rectal walls. It only took a few
        pumps before her ass was plugged like a cork in a champagne bottle. Tony
        connected the nozzle end to the enema tube, and turned the little valve
        to the open position. 
      The soapy enema began to fill her bowels, gravity quickly transferring
        the liquid from the enema bag at the top of the whipping post into Nancy&#146;s
        colon. Occasionally Tony would block the flow of the hose to allow the
        enema to settle within her. Nancy&#146;s cries and protests were ignored.
        Vince stood with Nancy&#146;s head pressed against his firm stomach;
        his hands were squeezing her small breasts, and enjoying her hardened
        nipples against his soft palms. 
      &quot;Nearly there, babe.&#148; Tony encouraged her. His hand reached
        down to massage her distended belly. Nancy moaned at the pregnant pain
        that had been visited upon her. 
      The enema flow stopped. The bag was empty and Nancy was full. Tony closed
        off the valve near the outer bulb and detached the tubes. They left her
        for fifteen minutes, bent over and chained, fighting the pain of the
        cramps in her distended belly. Nancy turned her head slowly from its
        downward facing position and saw Mike and Vince chatting and laughing
        with the six other bunnies. Vince was even sharing a lit cigarette with
        one of them. The laughter, Nancy knew, was directed at her. 
      The bucket containing her evacuated enema did not yield a key. Tony
        and Vince were disappointed that their dirty and unpleasant task had
        not produced the result they expected. Yet they still suspected Nancy
        was guilty, and in any other circumstance would have been whipping the
        truth out of her. However, because it was the day before the festival
        the bunnies were spared the whip, ensuring that visitors would find clean
        unmarked skin awaiting them. 
      Master Tony looked around suspiciously at the other bunnies. &#147;Does
        anyone else know about the missing key?&#148; 
      They shrugged their shoulders; no one had even heard about a missing
        key until they arrived to investigate. 
      &#147;Perhaps they need some help remembering?&#148; Vince suggested
        to Tony, a wicked grin on his face. &#147;Maybe we should give them some
        time to think about it, it might help them to recall something.&#148; 
      &#147;Excellent idea, Vince. You&#146;re right. Let&#146;s give them
        a little time to think. D&#146;you think if they had more blood flowing
        into their brains it would help them think better? Like if they were
        upside down?&#148; 
      Vince fetched some bed sheets from the cabin and started to cut them
        into long strips. The bunnies were sat down in the sand beneath the large
        swing frame a short distance from the cabin. It was a long and very sturdy
        five-meter scaffold pole eight feet above the sand.  
      One by one the bunnies had their ankles tied together with the newly-cut
        strips of their bedsheets. They were begging Nancy to tell them where
        she had hidden the key before they were all made to swing. Nancy, in
        return, pleaded with them to believe her that she knew nothing about
        the missing key. 
      It seemed fitting that Nancy should be first to be hung up. They helped
        her to her feet then Vince bent down to put her in a fireman&#146;s lift.
        He carried her underneath the scaffold bar. Tony took hold of the long
        trailing end of sheet around her ankles and tossed it over the bar then
        tied it back to her ankles again. Nancy was left swinging helplessly
        while they hauled the next bunny to her feet. 
      Soon all seven bunnies were dangling upside down in a neat row, all
        the while protesting their innocence and directing their anger at Nancy
        who was obviously to blame for their plight. She could do nothing to
        convince her fellow bunnies that she was as innocent as they were. Such
        was their anger that the two bunnies dangling on either side of Nancy
        started pushing her with their hands, forcing her to swing from side
        to side. 
      Vince intervened, securing their cuffed hands to a strip of sheet he
        tied around their waists. 
      If it wasn&#146;t bad enough dangling upside-down in the midday sun
        the handlers had one more torment for the bunnies - what they jokingly
        called &#145;pepper sauce&#146;. Just a few drops on their labia was
        enough to drive the bunnies mad for hours with its maddening itching
        and burning sensation. The plastic cup of the chastity belts offered
        no protection against it as the liquid dripping between its air holes
        and onto the bunnies&#146; flesh. 
      There was a notable side effect of the pepper sauce, which was that
        squeezing the breasts could partly alleviate the hot itchiness of the
        labia. While the bunnies all squirmed like fish on a line Tony and Vince
        were glad to do their best to assist them. All seven bunnies were begging
        Tony and Vince that their breasts needed to be squeezed, scratched and
        mauled, their nipples bitten, anything at all to save them from the maddening
        itch. The men obliged as best they could whilst reminding the insistent
        bunnies that they only had two hands each. 
      All that breast squeezing had aroused Tony and Vince beyond all reasonable
        endurance. They both lowered their pants and revealed their aching and
        erect members. Two of the bunnies would spend the afternoon with their
        belly and breasts spattered with the handlers&#146; cum. 
      GALTZ INTERRUPTED 
      Karen Galtz didn&#146;t exactly enjoy her journey to The Lodge. Her
        body strained and the leather cords digging into her as the pony trailer
        jogged rhythmically to the ponygirls&#146; steady pace. If it had been
        one of her bondage photo shoots she would have used her safe word/signal
        long ago.  
      The two mountain-bike style wheels of the trailer seemed to swish speedily
        along the gravel tracks to the accompaniment of the pony-boot bells,
        making Karen feel sleepy, despite her best efforts to stay alert. The
        journey did however confirm her belief about the superior quality of
        Rabbit Island ponygirls, even if she hadn&#146;t planned to test them
        in quite this manner. 
      Nor was it the way she expected to first see The Lodge. She, or rather,
        the ponies were received as if her capture and subsequent transportation
        had been well planned. The ropes that held her fast to the pony trailer
        were unfastened. She was lifted, still in her stringent leather-corded
        hog-tie onto a handcart. Judging by the padded section for her knees
        the handcart seemed designed for this exact purpose. A strap was buckled
        tightly across Galtz&#146;s back to keep her compressed against the cart&#146;s
        uprights. A black cloth bag was then placed over her head, blocking out
        her vision.  
      A man tilted the cart and wheeled her into the Lodge, treating her no
        different than he would a sack of potatoes. The short journey took Ms
        Galtz into the administration block. The porter kicked something at the
        bottom of the handcart, which sprung open a metal arm to stop the cart
        from toppling over. It left Ms Galtz in an unusual position: an upright
        hog-tie securely strapped to the handcart, and ready to be wheeled around
        again wherever her captors might wish.  
      The room fell silent, but it wasn&#146;t long before it filled with
        the sound of voices and the scraping of chairs on a wooden floor. Her
        cloth hood was pulled off, and adjusting to the light she focused on
        three men sitting at a wide desk in front of her. One of them was Master
        Alex. She vaguely recognized the face from somewhere. 
      Through her ballgag Ms Galtz began to plead her innocence in the strongest
        terms that her bondage would allow. The men looked at each other, smiling
        and shaking their heads.  
      &#147;Do you have anything else to say on the matter?&#148; One of them
        asked her. 
      She did, but that was just as garbled as her previous outburst. 
      Becoming weary of her incomprehensible ballgag-muffled voice, one of
        the men removed the large rubber ball from her mouth, buckling it loosely
        around her neck as if to indicate that she would soon be wearing it again. 
      &#147;Karen Galtz?&#148; 
      &#147;Yes!&#148; 
      &#147;A Journalist?&#148; 
      &#147;Yes!&#148; 
      &#147;Employed by the Global News Corporation?&#148; 
      She paused, surprised that they knew so much about her. &#147;Yes!&#148; 
      &#147;Why are you here?&#148; 
      She didn&#146;t answer. 
      &#147;Ms Galtz, we are not signatories to the Geneva Convention. We
        have all manner of tortures here to extract answers from you.&#148; 
      She stared at them defiantly, watching as one of them brought a small
        box onto the table. 
      &#147;Is it true that you have a phobia of spiders?&#148; 
      &#147;Yes,&#148; she meekly replied, even before one of the men lifted
        his hand fully out the box she could see the hairy legs of a tarantula
        on his hand. 
      &#147;Would you like to meet Cedric and his eight-legged friends?&#148; 
      Ms Galtz was sweating, the blood visibly draining from her. Sheer terror
        etched on her face. &#147;Okay! I&#146;ll talk. It&#146;s to do with
        your ponygirls.&#148; Her voice changed to whining whisper. &#147;Please,
        just put him away.&#148; 
      Once Cedric was back in his box and Ms Galtz had calmed down, she began
        to explain. 
      &#147;I interviewed a woman recently; a young woman who had lost her
        memory. She could barely remember anything after her fourteenth birthday,
        yet she appears to be about twenty-three years of age. She was discovered
        on a beach in Thailand, wandering naked and confused. But worst of all,
        her arms had been amputated at the shoulder.&#148; 
      Up til then she hadn&#146;t told them anything that hadn&#146;t already
        been widely reported. They urged her to continue. 
      &#147;She had a tattoo. A rabbit at the top of her thigh, just like
        your bunnies and ponygirls.&#148; 
      This time the men were shocked. &#147;And you think she came from here?
        It simply isn&#146;t possible. All our captives have the tattoo removed
        or altered before being disposed of. Besides, what happened to that girl
        was utterly barbaric. It would never happen on Rabbit Island.&#148; 
      &#147;My initial research concurs with that statement. Rabbit Island
        doesn&#146;t have a reputation for that kind of treatment, although the
        presence of the tattoo is confusing. If it can be shown that Rabbit Island
        is not involved with this woman I will drop all references to this place
        from my report. Now, if you would just untie me I can be on my way.&#148; 
      &#147;It&#146;s not that simple, Ms Galtz. I think the phrase is &#145;you&#146;ve
        seen too much already&#146;. I&#146;m afraid you&#146;ll have to stay
        here as our guest until this matter is resolved. We have already made
        provision with your employer to keep you here for six months.&#148; 
      She looked confused. &#147;That&#146;s impossible. I&#146;ve a job to
        do.&#148; 
      &#147;Your employer was most accommodating, in fact he was of the opinion
        it would do you some good. Said you were becoming a &#145;loose cannon&#146;.
        Ms. Galtz, I read your recent article on ponygirls where you stated...here,
        let me read it to you.... 
      &#147;The cult of human equestrianism, whilst thousands of years
          old has acquired a growing following in recent times. Every weekend
          throughout the world people play with harnesses, are attached to homemade
          carts, making animal noises, and appear to derive fun from the experience.
          With its associations with leather, bondage, domination, submission
          and bestial role-play it&#146;s easy to see that many kinky types would
          find much to amuse them in this fashionable activity. 
      A minority of the human ponies, males and females, are striving to
          capture a feeling that will forever elude them. Only if they were forced
          to be ponies against their will, with their liberty permanently denied
          them, would they truly experience the &#145;ponyhood&#146; they desire.
          Despite their regular weekend playtimes, there are certain aspects
          of this anthropomorphic kink that will have to remain forever a fantasy.&#148; 
      He put down the paper and grinned. &#147;We&#146;ve decided, Ms Galtz,
        that you should experience what you call &#145;ponyhood&#146; for yourself,
        Rabbit Island style. Then you&#146;ll know more of what you write about.
        After this meeting you will be taken to be pierced and tattooed. You&#146;ll
        spend a week in the punishment cells, then you start pony training.&#148; The
        Master turned to the handler standing nearby. &#147;Joe, take our new
        recruit to the soft cells, and don&#146;t forget the full body cavity
        search, we still haven't found that key.&#148; 
      Gagged and hooded once more, Karen Galtz felt the handcart transportation
        tilt forward at an angle. She was wheeled away to commence her latest
        and most unexpected assignment. 
      KATE TESTED AGAIN 
      Late in the afternoon Kate was released from the urinal pole and taken
        to the same room in which she suffered the milking indignity that morning.
        Alone in the room and sitting on its only chair, her unbound hands were
        soon at her pussy. Those hours spent in the men&#146;s room had taken
        its toll. She never dreamed she&#146;d ever see so many penises in a
        single day! Any one of them probing between her labia right now would
        be welcome. 
      The door opened and Kurt entered with two pussy-girls. They were different
        ones from the morning, although no less pretty. The rope they carried
        was the same, so were the tight white dresses with the flowing skirts. 
      &#147;Give bunny kate your rope,&#148; Kurt told one of the pussy-girls.
        She cheerfully obeyed. 
       He took the rope from the other pussy-girl, turned her around and tied
        her wrists. &#147;Tie her hands like this.&#148; He instructed Kate, &#147;and
        make sure it&#146;s tight.&#148; 
      Kate wasn&#146;t used to tying up others but took to it almost instantly.
        Kurt wasn&#146;t surprised - he knew that one who is herself regularly
        bound develops a good feel for how to do it to others. She tied her pussy-girl&#146;s
        wrists as tightly as Kurt had done his, even eliciting an oddly satisfying &#145;ouch&#146; from
        the pussy-girl as she tugged the final knot. Kurt seemed pleased. He
        and Kate then blindfolded their respective pussy-girls with soft white
        silk scarves. 
      It was a devious twist to the morning&#146;s breastfeeding. This time
        Kate was not only consenting but initiating and controlling it. She helped
        the pussy-girls to kneel either side of her chair, caressing their hair,
        almost mothering them as she guided their lips to her nipples. 
      Master Kurt stood aside, careful to stay outside the view of the hidden
        video camera. He quietly watched and delighted in the sight of two delectable
        blonde pussy-girls, bound, blindfolded and helpless suckling from Kate&#146;s
        swelling breasts. Kate, he thought, was showing all the signs of making
        the grade as a pussy-girl, but there were still many tests ahead of her. 
      IN THE DOGHOUSE 
      Kate was glad of a rest after her exhausting day. She was inwardly thrilled
        that instead of being sent to a cell she was taken back to the medical
        suite. It seemed so empty and quiet. Ray, she learned, had been evacuated
        by helicopter to a hospital hundreds of miles away. Dr Schmidt and Master
        Alex had accompanied him. Kurt cuffed her hands behind her then chained
        them to the same bed on which she slept the previous night. Despite the
        late daylight still illuminating the room (it was six o&#146;clock according
        to the clock on the wall) Kate was asleep within a few moments. 
      A hour later she was roused from her slumber by Kurt and pussy-girl
        lucy. The pussy-girl seemed very excited about something and Kate just
        knew it had to involve her. She didn&#146;t object when Lucy attended
        to her make-up again. This time Lucy cleaned off her lipstick and painted
        her eyes in a dramatic black. It was when her nose was also painted in
        black that Kate suspected something unusual was happening. 
      &#147;Hold these.&#148; Kurt instructed. Kate took a small spongy ball
        in each hand. When she squeezed her fist it could close around the ball,
        almost concealing it from view. Kurt and Lucy wrapped bandages around
        Kate&#146;s fists ensuring they stayed closed. Each hand was put in a
        black fist-shape leather bag that laced up onto her wrist like a boxing
        glove. They glued the laces so Kate wouldn&#146;t get out of the gloves
        without the aid of a sharp knife and somebody&#146;s steady hand. 
      Kate found it amusing, sparring playfully with Lucy as if she were a
        boxer. It was a light relief for someone who spent much of her time in
        chains. Next came the kneepads, which Kate found no less amusing. 
      Pushing her down onto padded hands and knees they gave Kate&#146;s feet
        a similar treatment. A slim but dense pad was tied onto her soles, with
        Kurt appearing to take great care with their application. After that
        Kate&#146;s feet were also laced and glued into soft leather boots. But
        Kate soon discovered that these boots were NOT made for walking. 
      &#147;Stand up and walk towards me,&#148; Kurt commanded, whilst backing
        up to the far side of the room. 
      Seemed easy enough, thought Kate, rising to her feet. 
      As soon as her sole pushed down on the floor she felt a powerful jolt,
        screamed with fright and fell back to her hands and knees. It was as
        if her hip had been dislocated. Master Kurt was greatly amused and even
        pussy-girl lucy couldn&#146;t help but smile. &#147;So you see, Kate,&#148; Kurt
        explained through his laughter, &#147;that&#146;s what happens if you
        try to stand up. You&#146;re a puppy now, and so you must learn to behave
        like one.&#148; 
      Puppy kate was then fitted with a body harness, an array of thin leather
        straps in a lattice pattern, surrounding but not covering Kate&#146;s
        fully rounded breasts. Lucy was lubricating a butt plug, at the end of
        which was a dog&#146;s tail, with its characteristic curve, in the same
        blonde colour as Kate&#146;s hair. &#147;Knees apart, puppy katie!&#148; The
        plug popped easily into position. 
      The body harness had a crotch strap that passed between Kate&#146;s
        legs and threaded through a ring at the base of her butt plug. It not
        only kept the plug within Kate&#146;s rectum but also held the tail in
        its correct dog-like curve. A small padlock was used to secure the strap
        in position. Pussy-girl lucy showed Kate she had the key on a cord around
        her neck, the key itself nestling between her tightly bodiced breasts.
        The point was well made - Lucy was her &#145;owner&#146;; a job that
        the pussy-girl was obviously relishing as she wrapped a thick leather
        collar around Kate&#146;s neck. 
      Master Kurt looked down at the new puppy. She looked much sexier than
        some of his previous puppies. &#147;A good doggy deserves a bone, don&#146;t
        you think?&#148;  
      Without waiting for the puppy&#146;s answer the bone was offered to
        her mouth. Kate took the six-inch white rubber bone firmly between her
        teeth. At each end of the authentic-looking bone were leather straps,
        which Lucy buckled together at the back of Kate&#146;s head. &#147;Wouldn&#146;t
        want you to lose such a nice juicy bone, would we?&#148; 
      Lucy clipped a chain leash to her puppy&#146;s collar and gave it a
        sharp encouraging tug. &#147;Better take you outside now. They don&#146;t
        like puppy dogs inside The Lodge.&#148; 
      Kate crawled by Lucy&#146;s side, along a crowded hallway where people
        walked past in all directions. It was her bit-gag, shaped like a doggy
        bone, that caused the most amusement for the visitors (and humiliation
        for Kate). Lucy apparently had no pressing duties to attend to as she
        happily stood and chatted to anybody that showed an interest in her new
        pet. Kate had never felt so small, crawling along looking over her blackened
        nose, an animal living at the level of people&#146;s shoes. 
      During her walk through the hallways someone tried to take her bone
        away, pretending not to notice the straps. He pulled Kate&#146;s head
        this way and that pretending that they were fighting for it. &#147;Look
        she doesn&#146;t want to let go!&#148; He jested. Kate growled in response,
        but it generated more amusement at her expense. She would have bitten
        him had she been able to. 
      Eventually they made it outside onto the large lawn that led to the
        pony&#146;s training ring. Lucy unclipped the leash and encouraged her
        puppy to walk alongside. Kate felt little inclination to stray and crawled
        along obediently at Lucy&#146;s side. At the far end of the lawn they
        reached a small doghouse, which Kate realized was to be her new home.
        Lucy delivered her lecture: 
      &#147;Katie. This is your home for the next couple of days. Now try
        to behave more like a dog. If you had a dog when you were young try to
        remember the fun you had with it.&#148; She looked Kate in her black
        puppy dog eyes and smiled. &#147;Do you have any idea how cute you look?
        Everybody thinks you&#146;re adorable. I could have sold you ten times
        over! But don&#146;t worry, I promise that nothing bad will happen to
        you while you&#146;re my puppy.&#148; She patted the key at her breast
        to remind Kate who was in charge. 
      &#147;Now Katie. You need training. The first thing to learn is how
        to wag your tail properly. Keep your knees firmly together and quickly
        wiggle your hips.&#148; 
      Kate tried it. A simple technique, but it worked. 
      &#147;Perfect! What a good doggy!&#148; Lucy said, knowing how important
        it was to praise good behavior in puppies. &#147;Now let&#146;s see how
        good you are at fetching.&#148; 
      Kate&#146;s bone-gag was unfastened and used as the stick for her to
        fetch. Lucy was a lousy thrower so Kate only had to crawl a few yards
        to retrieve it. Next Lucy taught her how to sit nicely in front of the
        human and how to offer up the bone so that it could be thrown again.
        After half a dozen throws both Lucy and her puppy were tired and the
        bone was once again secured in Kate&#146;s mouth; to prevent her from
        losing it, Lucy said. 
      The doghouse had a long sturdy chain fixed on the outside. The pussy-girl
        attached Kate&#146;s collar to the end of it, then, waggling her finger
        she told Kate to be a good doggy, promising to return later with supper. 
      Kate crawled inside the single-dog sized doghouse, lying down on the
        thin vinyl covered mattress. Even though the chain was simply clipped
        to the collar her paw-like gloves proved unable to manipulate the clip,
        or do anything else requiring digital dexterity, as she discovered when
        she tried to scratch the itch caused by the crotch strap. She sat outside
        leaning back against the doghouse, legs outstretched in a very un-doglike
        pose, enjoying the last of the day&#146;s sunshine.  
      Supper soon arrived. Kate greeted Lucy with a genuinely offered wag
        of her tail, pleased to see her owner carrying a two stainless steel
        bowls. The multicolored biscuits in one bowl looked uncannily like the
        ones her pet Labrador used to eat. Even the brand name stamped into each
        biscuit was the same! It was one aspect of authenticity she hadn&#146;t
        been expecting. She crunched her way through some of them, finding them
        palatable if not exactly delicious, and took a drink of water from the
        other bowl.  
      PONY NEWS 
      While Kate was eating Lucy leant on the fence a couple of yards behind
        the doghouse and watched some ponygirls being put through their paces.
        It was a practice session for the upcoming pony competition. The ponies
        were running through their routine for the dressage event, where ponygirl
        pairs are required to pull their trap in a preset sequence of steps and
        are graded on accuracy and poise. One of the pairs really caught the
        Lucy&#146;s eye. Tall, with marvelous posture and lean elegant thighs,
        that looked simply wonderful during their high-stepping phase. Their
        drivers were perfectionists, and while one man was seated in the trap
        controlling the reins another walked alongside the ponies looking for
        the smallest faults. He didn&#146;t hesitate to give them a hard rap
        with his cane when required. 
      They must have gone over and over the same sequence for twenty minutes,
        seeking perfection and, in Lucy&#146;s opinion, finding it. Only one
        thing spoiled the spectacle for Lucy - it was that these were not Rabbit
        Island ponygirls, they were one of the six visiting pairs. 
      After Kate&#146;s dry biscuit supper Lucy took her puppy to a secluded
        spot in the bushes to answer the call of nature. She unlocked the crotch
        strap and unplugging the tail and tucked the loose straps out of the
        way. Any residual dislike that Kate had for Lucy disappeared when her
        keeper sensitively took care of her hygiene before lubricating a re-inserting
        the tail and locking up the crotch strap again. The bone-gag was strapped
        back in place then they took a brief stroll around the flower borders
        before returning to the doghouse. 
      When Lucy returned to her other duties Kate sensed her long day was
        at an end, even though it was not yet dark. Her thoughts turned to Ray&#146;s
        accident, not quite able to believe that it was just twenty-four hours
        ago. She shed a couple of tears, and was aching to know if he was okay. 
      Kate was distracted by more ponies coming and going in the training
        ring, some she recognized but most she didn&#146;t. She felt sad knowing
        that Jessica and Debbie would not be amongst them. Instead of competing
        and having a chance to win with Ray controlling them, they were destined
        to spend the next five days on heavy transport duties with an unfamiliar
        driver controlling them. There just wasn&#146;t another driver with Ray&#146;s
        skills. 
      The training ring had emptied with the fading light when one last pony
        pair entered the ring. Kate knew just by the sound of the pony-boots
        that it was Jessica and Debbie yet couldn&#146;t quite understand how
        or why they were there. In a moment of wild optimism Kate move towards
        the fence to the full extend her neck chain allowed; straining to see
        who was driving. She was hoping it was Ray, but she knew that was impossible. 
      When the ponies trotted past, Kate saw that it was Tony, one of the
        handlers, doing the driving, bouncing unsteadily in the trap&#146;s bench
        seat as he rode along. Like many handlers he liked to try his hand at
        pony driving but his level of competence was limited to basic trotting
        and turning. He might be an efficient and respected handler, but a pony
        driver he wasn&#146;t. Kate covered her eyes with a paw; it was almost
        too embarrassing to watch. Even with Riccardo walking alongside giving
        instructions, and breaking the golden rule about talking to the ponies,
        the task ahead of them was immense. While the visiting ponygirls were
        in the ring preparing to put on a show, Jessica and Kate controlled by
        their new driver, could hardly trot in a straight line. 
      Riccardo, the Island&#146;s most experienced pony driver, was doing
        everything he could to encourage the Tony but it simply wasn&#146;t happening
        for them. The ponygirls were becoming frustrated by the lack of a firm
        hand they depended on. 
      While Kate was absorbed by the travails of the ponygirls she hadn&#146;t
        noticed a man approaching from behind her. He put a hand on her head
        causing her to yelp with fright. She turned to see it was Master Alex
        who had touched her. Genuinely happy to see him, she lifted up her rear
        end to give him an unambiguous wag of her tail then rested her face against
        his leg. She looked up at him with the bone wedged firmly between her
        teeth. How could he not be charmed by that black nose and soulful dark
        eyes? 
      Other than their almost affectionate greeting there was no conversation.
        This frustrated Kate because she felt sure Alex had news about Ray&#146;s
        condition. He walked over to lean on the fence as Lucy had done earlier
        and waited for the ponygirls to pull up in front of him. 
      Riccardo and Tony joined Master Alex at the fence glad to put their
        training aside for a few moments and were soon deep in conversation. 
      &#147;How is it going?&#148; Master Alex asked. 
      Riccardo laughed sardonically. &#147;Let&#146;s put it this way, Tony
        won&#146;t be troubling the dressage rankings, but he&#146;ll be fine
        for the haulage jobs.&#148; 
      Kate barked at the ponies as dogs often do. Blinkered as the ponygirls
        were, she was well out of their line of sight. Jessica sensed that their
        Masters&#146; attentions were elsewhere, so pulled Debbie slowly around
        to the direction of the barking. 
      Jessica almost literally jumped for joy when she caught sight of Kate.
        She smiled and laughed as much as a fully harnessed and bridled ponygirl
        would dare. The ponygirl and the puppy-girl! It was just their sense
        of humor to appreciate the absurdity of their situation. 
      Eventually Kate&#146;s yapping got through to Master Alex. He turned
        around and yelled at her to shut up. 
      &#147;As I was saying,&#148; Master Alex continued his conversation
        with Riccardo in a voice deliberately louder than required, &#147;Ray
        had the operation on his fractured skull today. He&#146;ll be out of
        action for a while, but he&#146;s going to be fine. The doctors said
        the excellent early care and treatment he received might have saved his
        life.&#148; 
      If he heard a collective groan of relief from the ponygirls and the
        puppy then Master Alex certainly didn&#146;t acknowledge it. It was too
        dark to continue the training by the time the men had finished talking.
        The ponies headed off with Riccardo and Tony sharing the bench seat for
        a quick ride back to The Lodge, enjoying the sudden spring in the steps
        of the ponygirls. 
      Master Alex, clearly exhausted, bade the puppy-girl goodnight with a
        stroke of her hair, and walked slowly across the dark lawn to the welcoming
        lights of The Lodge. 
      PLEASE SQUEEZE! 
      The approaching sound of the pony-boot bells on the supper run signified
        that the bunnies&#146; upside-down bondage and torment would soon be
        over. They were exhausted from their futile writhing against that infuriating
        itch in their pussies. For a couple of them it had still not abated.
        They still twitched occasionally while the others hung limp, utterly
        drained of fight. 
      Frank (the duty pony driver) and Kurt (the senior handler) lifted down
        and untied the bunnies, but it became apparent that the bunnies had more
        on their minds than supper. They were prowling around in frustration,
        thrusting their breasts in the direction of the two men, some coyly,
        others blatant and provocatively, begging the men to massage their breasts
        to finally relieve their itching. Above all else they wanted their chastity
        belts removed, even if it was only for five minutes.  
      The men took pity on them and told them to get in a line, side by side. &#147;In
        order of breast size!&#148; Frank added with a grin, &#147;and if we
        think you&#146;re wrong you won&#146;t get a massage.&#148; 
      They watched, highly amused, as the bunnies stood around arguing over
        it. Nancy, with the smallest breasts, was sheepishly waiting at the end
        of the line while the difficult middle places were sorted out. 
      Kurt and Frank walked slowly down the line of seven puffed out chests,
        making sure that the bunnies had completed the task correctly. Nancy
        was grimacing, Sumi was in tears, and others had the anguish of an unscratchable
        itch written on their faces. 
      &#147;Very good.&#148; said Frank. The men applied themselves to the
        onerous task of giving all their breasts a prolonged and heavy massage.
        Starting, naturally, with the largest.  
      Their chastity belts however stayed firmly in place. Orders were orders. 
      NANCY GOES FOR A WALK 
      Still believing Nancy to be guilty some of the other bunnies were not
        in a forgiving mood. Paradoxically the authorities at The Lodge saw it
        differently. If, went the argument, Nancy had taken the key why was she
        still wearing her handcuffs? They had decided not to prosecute her further,
        at least not until the journalist had been thoroughly interrogated. 
      Later that evening, not missed by the other bunnies, Nancy headed up
        the trail to look for Karen Galtz&#146;s backpack, hoping and praying
        that it had not been recovered by the handlers and taken to The Lodge.
        She managed to locate it hidden a few yards away from the trail and begun
        pulling out its contents. Besides a complete change of clothing, a torch,
        a first-aid kit and rations, there was a survival pack. It included a
        coiled-up wire saw. 
      It took a long time, an hour or more, to rig up the wire saw between
        tree branches so that it could cut through a metal link of her cuffs.
        Nancy&#146;s persistence had paid off and her hands were finally separated.
        She swung her hands though the air in during wild triumphant dance, ignoring
        the pain in her shoulders caused by their previous immobility.  
      With her arms free she could wear Ms Galtz&#146;s spare clothing. She
        tried on Karen&#146;s bra but found it too constricting after so many
        months hanging free. She flung it away disdainfully. It just seemed like
        exchanging one form of bondage for another.  
      The shirt, she was delighted to see, had long-sleeves that could hide
        the bracelets of the handcuffs which remained on each wrist. There was
        no time to remove her locked-on leather collar and chain but she found
        a large red bandana that she tied around her neck to conceal it. 
      Wearing real shoes and socks, to go with her other clothing Nancy felt
        alive again. She put on the backpack, which contained little except its
        survival supplies and most importantly, Ms Galtz&#146;s photographic
        proof of slavery on the island. She made her way down to the harbour
        and waited patiently, having no idea of the time. 
      At exactly midnight, on a starlit but moonless night, Nancy stepped
        aboard a speedboat and made her escape from Rabbit Island.

      PUPPY LOVE 
      Kate was awake early. Early enough to see the sun rising, one of the
        few times she had witnessed that event since her arrival on Rabbit Island.
        She had slept well in the doghouse, secured only by the long chain attached
        to her collar. Wide-awake and feeling refreshed, she enjoyed her solitude
        on the manicured lawn while the rest of the island slept. She studied
        the suede mitts holding her hands into fists, or rather, paws. How useless
        her hand was without the dexterity of her fingers. 
      It didn&#146;t take long for boredom to set in. Time never goes so slowly
        as for an impatient early riser waiting for others to stir. Luckily for
        Kate, pussy-girl Lucy was also up early. She was the person that Kate
        most wanted to see. Once again Lucy took care of Kate&#146;s intimate
        needs, unlocking the crotch strap to remove the doggy-tail butt-plug.
        Kate crawled under a bush and took advantage of her limited opening time. 
      Lucy cleaned her up and inserted the tail again. Naturally Lucy had
        a treat for such a good puppy. She unlocked the bit-like bone between
        Kate&#146;s teeth. It took all of Kate&#146;s willpower to stop herself
        from talking to Lucy. Her good behavior was rewarded with some small
        biscuits that she took with her mouth from the palm of Lucy&#146;s hand.
        After a slurp of water from her bowl, Kate&#146;s bone-gag was strapped
        back in place. While Lucy petted her hair Kate concluded that there were
        far worse things in life than being Lucy&#146;s puppy. 
      Back on pussy-girl Lucy&#146;s leash, Kate crawled alongside her keeper
        back to The Lodge. They walked through the empty front lobby, then into
        the accommodation area. Black satin sacks were available at the door
        to ensure that bunnies, puppies and other subs were hooded before entering
        the area. It wasn&#146;t very far down the corridor before Lucy guided
        Kate into a room. 
      Her hood was removed and Kate looked around the room. It was a well
        lived-in hotel room with a few personal touches that indicated a long-term
        guest. Kate was already pining for Lucy the moment she closed the door
        behind her... that was until she saw who was sitting up in bed. Puppies
        can be so fickle! 
      Master Alex patted the bed covers and bade her to come to the bedside.
        Like any self-respecting labrador puppy her exuberance took over, Kate
        leapt up onto the bed and gave him an affectionate slobbering on his
        cheek. That was all she could do with the bone lodged between her teeth.
        She hoped the point was well made. If they wanted doggy she&#146;d give
        them doggy, including the slobber! 
      Kate snuggled down at Master Alex&#146;s side, careful not to overstep
        the mark with her antics. While he continued to read some kind of report
        in bed she laid outstretched beside him, enjoying the softness of the
        mattress. It wasn&#146;t long before Kate felt Alex&#146;s hand idly
        feeling her breasts and stroking her belly through the straps of her
        harness. She made a little groaning noise to indicate her pleasure at
        his touch, hoping his hand would move just a little south to where the
        terrain was even more inviting. 
      Kate sensed that she wasn&#146;t the only one making groaning sounds.
        They definitely weren&#146;t coming from Master Alex, who was quietly
        reading. She noticed that his knees were bent and pointing upwards and
        spread wide to create a &#145;tent&#146; under the quilt. Her Master
        watched with amusement as Kate prodded the area tentatively with her
        paw. Something moved, or rather, someone moved. &#147;Want to see what
        I have in my bed?&#148; Alex teased. 
      Kate got up onto all fours and barked, although &#145;wooh&#146;, was
        the best she could manage with that bone wedged between her teeth. She
        wagged her tail eagerly, knowing how much Alex liked her doing that. 
      He pulled back the covers just a little, enough to reveal Jessica&#146;s
        head, her mouth ring-gagged and stuffed with his cock. Kate and Jessica&#146;s
        delight at seeing each other again was tinged with mutual embarrassment
        at their respective positions. Jessica had no choice about her predicament,
        yet still felt ashamed to be discovered by her best friend in such a
        sexually submissive position. She shook her head the small amount her
        cock-filled mouth allowed, as if to say &#145;It&#146;s not what it seems&#146;.
        It was, however, exactly what it seemed. 
      Kate&#146;s case was a little more difficult to argue. Doggy accoutrements
        or not, she was not bound up in any traditional sense and was manifestly
        enjoying her new role as a puppy. The tightly bound Jessica was having
        difficulty with that. 
      Alex threw back the remaining part of the duvet to reveal Jessica&#146;s
        naked body, immaculately hog-tied in a complex pattern of soft white
        rope. Kate didn&#146;t hesitate, having no idea when she would next be
        so close to her friend. She climbed up over Jessica&#146;s body and sat
        facing Alex. He seemed greatly amused, and even more so when Kate bent
        forward on Jessica&#146;s body pretending to hump her like a randy dog.
        No one had explicitly told her which sex of dog she was a supposed to
        be. 
      While Master Alex caressed Kate&#146;s blonde hair, enjoying the comical
        yet sexy expression on her face, he failed to notice that Kate&#146;s
        mound was pressed hard against Jessica&#146;s bound hands. Jessica couldn&#146;t
        help but notice and was doing her best to force her fingers past Kate&#146;s
        crotch strap. Meantime, the sight of Kate&#146;s randy display and her
        vigorous rocking had brought Alex&#146;s cock to full erection within
        Jessica&#146;s mouth. 
      Jessica, despite her fiendish hog-tie, relished a challenge. She attempted
        bring off both Master Alex and Kate, even though her own needs might
        remain unfulfilled. 
      It was an extremely hot few minutes before their menage-a-trois was
        interrupted by a knock on the door. Pussy-girl Lucy entered, an expression
        of open-mouthed shock on her face. 
      &#147;Bad doggy!&#148; She yelled, pulling Kate from the bed in such
        a way that the sole of the puppy&#146;s foot made contact with the floor.
        Kate yelped in pain, she&#146;d almost forgotten about the anti-walking
        sensors. She quickly returned to her hands and knees growling angrily
        at Lucy as she clipped the leash back on to her collar. 
      &#147;Master Alex, have you forgotten that Jessica has her class with
        Madame Cervoix this morning? It starts in ten minutes!&#148; Lucy led
        Kate from the room, chastising her as they went. 
      &#147;Damn!&#148; Was all Master Alex could say as he undid the cord
        at the base of his cock so it could be unhitched from Jessica&#146;s
        ring-gag. 
      Madame Cervoix, the world-renowned authority on oral sex techniques,
        had been paid a large sum of money to visit the island during the festival.
        She was there to give her &#147;Oral Skills for Slavegirls&#148; training
        course. Jessica and Kate were enrolled in the first class of the day.
        Alex hurriedly released Jessica from the hog-tie and had placed her in
        handcuffs just as Erik arrived. 
      Erik put a hood over Jessica&#146;s head and guided her naked rope-imprinted
        body towards the classroom. 
      ORAL SKILLS FOR SLAVEGIRLS 
      There were three others already seated in the class when Erik led Jessica
        into the classroom. Each of them was kneeling on her shins with her hands
        tied or cuffed behind her. A foot-long chain fixed the wrists loosely
        to the floor.  
      Jessica joined them, kneeling in the last available position alongside
        Kate. On the floor between Jessica&#146;s legs was a plastic zip-locked
        bag containing a long and narrow black anal plug and a sachet of lubricant.
        A wire trailed ominously from the bag and along the floor in front of
        her. 
      &#147;Legs wider. Bend forward.&#148; Erik instructed the kneeling Jessica. 
      He expertly teased the plug around the opening of her anus, an action
        that caused for Jessica to relax herself as she had been trained. Erik
        pushed firmly on the plug and it eased slowly into her rectum until her
        sphincter closed upon its narrow neck. There was a definite click that
        Jessica heard and felt. Erik has flicked a small switch on the base of
        the butt plug. Jessica noted the trailing wire running from the plug,
        along the floor and up a chrome stand, like a heavy-duty microphone stand,
        two feet in front of her. 
      Kate was delighted to be sat next to Jessica. They were able to talk
        freely while waiting for Madame Cervoix to arrive. She explained to Jessica
        why she was acting like a puppy. 
      &#147;A pussy-girl?&#148; Jessica said in disbelief and anger. &#147;You&#146;re
        training to be a pussy-girl?&#148; 
      Kate became upset; she hadn&#146;t expected Jessica to be angry instead
        of pleased to see her. &#147;Why are you so negative about it? I just
        thought I&#146;d be able to see you more!&#148; Her voice cracked and
        tears formed in her eyes. 
      Jessica tried to explain. &#147;Katie. You can&#146;t be a pussy-girl
        without betraying us ponygirls and bunnies. It means you approve of what
        they are doing on Rabbit Island. One day you could be expected to punish
        me. Then what would you do?&#148; 
      &#147;I&#146;d never hurt you Jessi,&#148; Kate sobbed. &#147;I&#146;m
        going to tell them I want to go back to the bunny camp. They can stick
        the rest of this pussy-girl trial up their fat asses.&#148; 
      Jessica looked sympathetically her friend&#146;s tearstained face, trying
        not to laugh at the black streaks her tears had made out of her makeup. &#147;So
        you say you&#146;ll be working in the medical suite?&#148; 
      Kate nodded and snuffled. &#147;It looks like it. If Dr Schmidt agrees
        to take me.&#148; 
      Jessica paused to think. &#147;Maybe you should see how it goes? We
        need a good nurse at the Lodge. They might even let you administer my
        vitamin jabs?&#148; 
      They both laughed, and wished they could have a friendly hug. Kneeling,
        cuffed and butt-plugged staring at huge dildos in front of their noses,
        the best Jessica could manage was to lean over and kiss Kate&#146;s shoulder.
        Jessica studied her friend&#146;s dog collar and body harness, and the
        streaked black makeup on her face. &#147;God, you could get arrested
        for looking that cute, Katie.&#148; 
      Alongside Jessica and Kate were two women, somewhat bemused by Kate
        and Jessica&#146;s behavior, and fascinated by Kate in her puppy attire.
        After Kate had welcomed them to Rabbit Island, they introduced themselves. 
      &#147;Eva from Argentina. I am a lawyer; or rather I was a lawyer. I&#146;m
        the daughter of a wealthy man, but for two years now I am a prisoner
        at La Finca de las Cadenas in South America.&#148; 
      &#147;I&#146;m Suchita from India. I was a movie actress in Bombay until
        two months ago.&#148;  
      She was modest as well as beautiful; being one of Bollywood&#146;s most
        adored stars. &#147;When I was kidnapped I thought that I would be ransomed
        for money, but instead I became a possession of a very rich man. Now
        this is my life. Most of the time I am in his house. I live naked in
        a small hanging cage like an exotic bird. It is so shameful!&#148; She
        looked down sadly at her dark-skinned and very slim body unable to come
        to terms with what happened to her. 
      Both were extraordinarily beautiful. Given the trouble and expense of
        shipping a slave across the world for a week&#146;s &#145;holiday&#146;,
        it was not surprising. They were not merely sexual slaves like Jessica
        and Kate but exotic status symbols that could only be shown off at festivals
        such as these. Seeing the sad expressions on the visitor&#146;s faces,
        Jessica felt sad too, and a little guilty that perhaps her life wasn&#146;t
        as bad as others. 
      Jessica looked up at the top of the chrome stand and couldn&#146;t help
        but laugh. There was a cardboard cut out face of a famous American movie
        star. Each of the students had a different face on her stand, representing
        their respective countries of origin. 
      The brisk click-clack of feminine heels in the corridor interrupted
        their jokes about the pictured faces and heralded Madame Cervoix&#146;s
        entry into the classroom. She was dressed in a smart pinstriped jacket
        and skirt. Her dark hair and make-up were immaculate. For such an authority
        on oral gratification it was not surprising that she had the most amazing
        mouth - big, wide and shapely red lips and perfect white teeth. 
      &#147;Good morning students,&#148; she began, casting her eyes down
        to the four of them &#147;...and welcome to my course &#145;Oral Skills
        for Slavegirls&#146;. For the next three mornings I will teach you all
        I can about how to please your Masters with your mouth. You have everything
        to gain and nothing to lose from this, so I expect your full attention
        and commitment during these classes. 
      &#147;Before you can learn, you must first unlearn the bad habits you
        picked up as teenagers. We shall start at the very beginning with a lesson
        in human biology.&#148; She turned on a slide projector and revealed
        a large color picture showing a cross-section of a man&#146;s sexual
        organs. 
      A highly informative hour later, and after taking questions from her
        students, Madame Cervoix announced it was time for a coffee break. 
      &#147;Now... none of you have had breakfast this morning?&#148; 
      They all shook their heads. 
      &#147;Good, because I&#146;m providing breakfast for you. You will find
        it in the phallus in front of you. Place your mouth over the phallus
        and move back and forth as deeply as you can. If your movement is strong
        and deep enough you will get a little reward. If you fail to stimulate
        the feeder into delivering your breakfast you will receive correction
        from the anal motivator. I shall return in twenty minutes by which time
        you&#146;ll have had your breakfast and be warmed up for the next lesson.&#148; 
      She pressed a button on a small remote control she was holding. Classical
        music started playing. Very pleasant, thought Kate. Just as she was asking
        Jessica whether the music was by Mozart, the anal motivators burst into
        life. All four students received an electric shock in the rectum eliciting
        a four-part &#147;ooowww!&#148; in response. 
      &#147;Let&#146;s eat, Katie,&#148; Jessica said, shuffling forward a
        couple of inches and stretching her mouth over the thick phallus. Jessica
        had experienced this feeding system once before when she was caged and
        transported to the island (RI ch9). It didn&#146;t take long before she
        felt the first squirt of the cum mixture at the back of her mouth. Kate,
        in thinking of her regular oral servicing of Ray, was soon feeding happily
        also. Eva too, was enjoying some success.  
      Suchita, judging by her regular high-pitched squeals, was having no
        success at all. Her delicate mouth was stretched around top of the phallus,
        tears streaming from both eyes. 
      Kate broke off from her feeding. &#147;Suchita, you have to go deeper,
        you&#146;ll get nothing from the tip! Yes...like that! Keep going like
        that. Yeeeeooooowww!&#148;  
      The anal motivator was triggered by Kate&#146;s momentary lapse of activity.
        After that, Kate decided, Suchita was on her own! 
      THE HUNTING GAME 
      Rabbit Island festivals always got off to a great start with The Hunting
        Game. Rather than have their sexual victims laid out a plate, so to speak,
        the visitors had to go out into the fields and hunt them down. Actually,
        they didn&#146;t really have to, it was just damn good fun to do so! 
      The bunnies, twenty of them from the three different camps, were prepared
        for action immediately after breakfast, ready to be led up to the high
        ground in the center of the island where most of the action took place. 
      The handlers soon realized that one of the bunnies was missing... 
      &#147;For the last time,&#148; Tony shouted at the six remaining bunnies
        in the camp. &#147;Does anyone know where bunny nancy has gone?&#148; This
        bunny was really testing his patience, and indeed that of her former
        companions. 
      They gave a collective shrug of their shoulders. They knew no more about
        Nancy&#146;s whereabouts than they did about the key yesterday.  
      There didn&#146;t seem any point in worrying further about the truant
        bunny. This was an island and they knew Nancy would be found sooner or
        later, whether she had unlocked her cuffs or not. The tracking device
        in Nancy&#146;s pearl earrings could emit her location once the hunters
        were equipped with the receiver units. As soon as they got within one
        hundred yards of her she would be picked up by the receiver. 
      Tony and Riccardo prepared their ever-declining stock of bunnies for
        the hunt. While Tony fitted each with a regulation ball-gag (padlocked
        on), Riccardo was responsible for the goggles, which were normal swimming
        goggles to protect the bunnies&#146; eyes from any stray paint balls.
        The heavily tinted goggles also had another purpose in severely restricting
        their sight and hence their ability to evade the hunters for too long. 
      Linking a length of chain between each bunny&#146;s collar they were
        led by Riccardo&#146;s ponygirls Linda and Karita in a line from the
        beach up to the middle of the island. 
      PONY PREPARATION 
      The Oral Skills for Slavegirls lesson ended with a quiz (an oral one
        of course.) All four students thought they&#146;d done quite well, although
        none were perfect. Madame Cervoix punched their scores into her control
        panel before leaving the class. &#147;You&#146;ll get your grades later,&#148; she
        explained. 
      The students talked quietly amongst themselves while they waited for
        their respective handlers to take them to the next appointments. They
        had to admit that the lesson had been very informative and even kind
        of fun. 
      Their conversation was interrupted by a loud beep from Madame Cervoix&#146;s
        control panel. A few seconds later the anal motivators burst into life.
        Painful jolts pulsed through their bodies. The four students lunging
        for the phalluses in front of them, hoping it would save them from the
        shocks as it did at breakfast. 
      No matter how hard they sucked, the shocks just kept coming. The soft
        phallus was performing a different role now, giving the girls something
        to bite down on as their bodies jerked and arched in agonizing spasms.
        One by one the motivators stopped. Kate&#146;s first, then Eva&#146;s
        and Jessica&#146;s. They each sat quietly recovering while Suchita continued
        to receive more shocks. Each student had received her respective grade,
        and felt highly motivated to do better in tomorrow&#146;s class. 
      Pussy girl Lucy came to collect her pet from the classroom, replacing
        the anal motivator with the puppy&#146;s tail. Naturally the bone was
        once again fastened between Kate&#146;s already sore lips. 
      Erik removed Jessica back to the ponygirl quarters where she was required
        for duty. 
      Debbie - Jessica&#146;s ponygirl pair - was eager to hear all about
        the class, so while they prepared for duty, Jessica gave her a full account.
        Jessica couldn&#146;t understand why Debbie found it so funny. 
      They quickly plaited and pinned up each other&#146;s hair so that the
        neck was fully exposed. Like the other ponygirls they had long untamed
        hair, which when not on pony duties cascaded freely over their bare shoulders. 
      Next they rubbed a lubricating sun cream all over, giving the skin a
        dark lustrous appearance. The pony partner was needed to complete this
        task on the other&#146;s back. 
      With their naked bodies glistening, they headed for the adjacent tack
        room to put on their pony boots. They always take great care with their
        fitting, ensuring that they are tightly laced but comfortable., knowing
        from experience that an ill-fitting boot will make for a truly painful
        and miserable day. 
      Finally, they secured themselves to await the arrival of their pony
        driver. Jessica pushed a large sponge ball into her mouth. It is impossible
        to expel without using a hand. Debbie did likewise a few feet away.  
      Dangling from a chain attached to a ceiling joist is a pair of handcuffs
        at waist height. Each ponygirl fixed herself into these holding her hands
        behind her back. Then, locked in their self-bondage they silently awaited
        their pony driver.  
      It is like a period of transition, an uncomfortable stage where she
        is neither a ponygirl nor a naked woman. Usually the wait will be no
        more than ten minutes but it can be much longer. Unable to do anything
        other than stand and look at each other the ponygirls are always very
        relieved at the arrival of their pony driver... except today, when they
        knew it would not be Ray. Tony would substitute for him so Jessica and
        Debbie knew it was going to be a long and hard day. 
      The inner door to the tack room is like that of a cell, with strong
        vertical bars, Tony stood on the other side. Luckily Frank, another pony
        driver, had come along to assist Tony in rigging up the ponygirls.  
      &#147;First thing we always do before entering the tack room is ensure
        the ponygirls are securely cuffed.&#148; Frank explained. Jessica and
        Debbie turned their backs towards the men and each tugged her arms apart
        as they had been taught. 
      &#147;Never... ever... enter unless you are sure they are properly cuffed.&#148; Frank
        added. He makes us sound like Hannibal Lecter, Jessica thought. The men
        entered the tack room and inspected the ponygirls to ensure their hair
        was correctly pinned up and their bodies properly coated with the sun
        lotion. 
      &#147;First we put their bridles on.&#148; Frank explained to the inexperienced
        Tony. &#147;Here...you do debbie and I&#146;ll do Jessica. Stick your
        finger in her mouth to hook out the sponge... mind she doesn&#146;t bite.&#148;  
      Tony could never tell whether Frank was joking. He looked tentatively
        at Debbie&#146;s mouth, observing the red sponge between her perfect
        white teeth. He pushed a thumb and forefinger between her lips and quickly
        pulled out the ball, very relieved to still have his fingers. Debbie
        just smiled. 
      &#147;Now put the bridle straps on like I&#146;m doing. The hole for
        buckling is clearly marked in blue... Push the bit well back in her mouth...you&#146;ll
        feel it clip into place... now the chin strap... Perfect...And finally
        clip the little padlocks into the two slots. 
      Jessica and Debbie were agreed that the moment they got the bit between
        their teeth was when they felt like ponygirls, and would also be treated
        as such. Frank had a confident touch, fitting the bridle snugly on Jessica&#146;s
        head as if he&#146;d been doing all his life. 
      &#147;Right. Let's deal with their pesky hands or else their fingers
        get in the way. We get them to make the hand into a fist and slip the
        suede bag over it. The Velcro tabs will hold it closed. Just give her
        a snap of the riding crop if she gives you any trouble, and remember
        to make a chalk mark on her thigh. Let her know who&#146;s boss!&#148; 
      The crop wasn&#146;t needed. Jessica and Debbie seldom gave trouble
        these days. What was the point when all it did was accumulate punishments? 
      &#147;Now on to the harness. Drop it over her head and shoulders and
        buckle each strap to the marked hole... As these two have larger tits
        than many ponies we&#146;ve fixed a little soft mesh material between
        the straps to stop them from bouncing around. 
      With Jessica&#146;s suede covered hands already chained at the correct
        height it was easy for Frank to wrap the leather cuff around her wrists.
        He secured them hammerlock-fashion to her harness. Jessica was almost
        enjoying Frank&#146;s brisk handling - even while instructing Tony he
        was going quicker than Ray did. 
      &#147;On to the reins...&#148; Frank paused, watching patiently as Tony
        fiddling with last buckles on the harness. &#147;If you dig around with
        the netting of her breasts you&#146;ll find her nipples. Just tug on
        their rings, until they poke through the netting. It doesn&#146;t hurt &#145;em.
        Good&#133; now padlock two reins onto each nipple ring.&#148; 
      After both men had done exactly that, there were eight flat leather
        cords, each around ten feet in length, hanging down from their nipples
        and trailing over the floor. 
      Frank showed Tony how to thread the upper reins, which went up from
        the nipple, and threaded back through rings to the side of the ponygirls&#146; bridles.  
      The lower reins went downwards from the nipples, joining through a central
        D ring on the ponygirl&#146;s belt before being threaded through the
        six rings in her labia. It created an attractive Y shape, linking the
        most intimate parts of her body.  
      Frank explained the intricacies of the &#145;rein stoppers&#146;. These
        ensured that the reins could only be pulled a limited distance before
        snagging, thus preventing the ponygirls&#146; nipples from being subjected
        to overstretching. 
      &#147;Always test that the stoppers are functioning!&#148; Frank said,
        tugging on all the reins to the maximum extent the stoppers allowed.
        He studied the movement of the ponies&#146; nipples ensuring they weren&#146;t
        stretched too far. Jessica and Debbie couldn&#146;t help moaning in response.
        It wasn&#146;t pain they were feeling. Frank laughed at their reaction. &#147;My
        ponygirls like that part too.&#148; 
      He gripped each pony nipple in turn, checking the piercing, and then
        squeezed the breast, purely because he knew the ponygirls liked it. 
      Tony seemed flustered by all the intimate contact with Debbie&#146;s
        soft flesh. With her little movements and cute noises Debbie knew what
        she was doing. She was amused to see Tony had a raging hard-on. 
      Just about maintaining his self-control Tony finished the job. If he
        didn&#146;t know Frank better he might have questioned the driver&#146;s
        sexual orientation at that point.  
      &#147;Yes, it is difficult at first,&#148; Frank admitted, &#147;but
        we get used to it. Horny bitches aren&#146;t they? I don&#146;t know
        what it is about this harness that does it to them! Listen Tony, judging
        by what you&#146;ve got in your middle pocket I think you&#146;d better
        leave the tail fitting for me.&#148; 
      Jessica and Debbie spread their legs and bent forward on cue while Frank&#146;s
        brisk manner in ponygirl preparation continued. After a firm push from
        him and a grunt from Jessica the tail plug popped into its place in Jessica&#146;s
        rectum. A few quick squeezes on the little bulb-pump hidden in the tail
        hair ensured it would not fall out during the upcoming exertions. 
      The ponygirls were led out and hitched to the trap. Getting the right
        length in each of the retaining straps was an art best left to an experienced
        driver. Frank could only really guess at the adjustments for Jessica
        and Debbie, and had to check himself from apologizing in advance if he
        had got it wrong. 
      In front of them, already harnessed and hitched up to their trap and
        trailer were ponies Diana and Melinda. A man and a woman were petting
        them, although with all their harnesses and straps it wasn&#146;t easy
        to pet an on-duty ponygirl. Most visitors simply tugged gently on their
        reins trying to get a reaction out of the seemingly impassive ponies. 
      Frank mounted the trap, and with a subtle tug on the rein Diana and
        Melinda walked a few steps and then broke into a slow trot. 
      Meanwhile Tony had mounted the seat of Jessica and Debbie&#146;s trap.
        Jessica felt a tug on her reins, her nipples pulled sharply downwards,
        a signal for the ponies to stop. As they were already stationary Jessica
        and Debbie decided to start trotting behind Frank&#146;s ponygirls. 
      HUNTED AND HOG-TIED 
      Jessica and Debbie followed behind Frank&#146;s trap as best they could.
        Their main problem was the inadequate driving and inappropriate whipping
        from Tony. 
      They knew that Ray was a good driver, but didn&#146;t know how good
        until they were driven by somebody like Tony. Ray knew how to use the
        whipper with economy, saving the hardest strokes for the times when they
        were needed and the softer ones for general encouragement. They and their
        sore behinds were missing him terribly. 
      They managed to get to the hunting base more or less intact, pulling
        up immediately behind Diana and Melinda. Further ahead were Riccardo&#146;s
        ponies, Linda and Karita and right at the front were Sandra and Cathy
        who were just about to head back to the Lodge. 
      Each pony pair was hauling not just the usual lightweight trap but also
        a six-foot long trailer. This was a lightweight single axle design running
        on two sturdy mountain-bike style wheels. Sandra&#146;s trailer was already
        loaded with its cargo: Five miserable squirming naked females in a neat
        row, facing alternately left and right, to better utilize the space on
        the trailer. Each was painfully hog-tied using the same leather as their
        reins. Jessica was trying to recognize them as the trailer went past. 
      The other trailers were gradually filled with the remaining captured
        bunnies. Once filled, each trailer departed back to The Lodge. As ponygirls
        Jessica and Debbie were the last pair, they had the longest wait.  
      Jessica was a bunny when the previous hunting game took place several
        months ago . What&#146;s more, she was the last bunny caught by the hunters;
        hence she won the bunnies&#146; part of the competition (RI ch.12). It
        was that event, she realized, which had initiated her regular contacts
        with Master Alex. 
      Eventually they departed back to The Lodge hauling their trailer load
        of exhausted hog-tied females. Jessica had a nagging feeling that Nancy
        had not been amongst those caught. There could be a dozen reasons for
        it but Jessica hoped quietly for the best reason of all - that Nancy
        was no longer on the island. 
      Upon reaching the paddock of The Lodge it became obvious from the people
        milling around that something had gone wrong and that it concerned the
        ponygirls. As ever, because of their blinkers and their position, ponygirls
        Jessica and Debbie were at the peripheral of the action, but it didn&#146;t
        stop them hearing the conversation - ponygirl Linda had twisted her ankle.
        They saw her being carried into the medical suite. 
      Linda&#146;s accident didn&#146;t mean that ponygirls Jessica and Debbie
        would miss their routine punishment for misdemeanors during the trip.
        They were clipped to the punishment rail and while a crowd of guests
        gathered around. Tony inspected the chalk marks on Jessica&#146;s thigh
        and delivered their lashes - six strokes each. Unfortunately for Jessica
        and Debbie, Tony&#146;s prowess with the whip was much better than his
        pony driving. 
      BONES 
      Kate was crawling through some thick shrubbery looking for her bone
        when pussy-girl Lucy came to fetch her. A handful of guests were having
        great fun with Kate&#146;s doggy persona, making her crawl after her
        bone in all directions as well as trying to teach her some obscene new
        tricks. Lucy clipped the leash onto Kate&#146;s collar, buckled the bone-gag
        between her teeth and led her puppy away from the disappointed visitors. 
      They entered the courtyard just as Tony was thrashing Jessica and Debbie,
        but crawling on her hands and knees she could see nothing as Lucy led
        her into the medical suite. 
      Lucy entered into the surgery and saw the doctor attending to Linda&#146;s
        ankle. &#147;Here&#146;s kate, sir, as you requested.&#148; 
      &#147;Thank you lucy. You may go.&#148; 
      &#147;Good luck,&#148; Lucy whispered to Kate, ruffling her puppy&#146;s
        blonde hair affectionately as she departed. 
      
         *** 
       
      &#148;So, what do you know about twists and fractures?&#148; Dr Schmidt
        asked Kate while carefully cutting off the paws from her hands and feet. 
      &#147;Enough, I think.&#148; she replied honestly. &#147;But you&#146;ll
        excuse me if I&#146;m a little rusty as I haven&#146;t been able to practice
        my profession for a while. I&#146;ve been tied up a lot recently.&#148; 
      The Doctor didn&#146;t appreciate Kate&#146;s sarcasm. His stern look
        over the top of his glasses said it all. She apologized immediately. 
      &#147;Now, go to the bathroom, clean up your face and put on your apron.
        We need to get this pony&#146;s ankle treated.&#148; 
      Kate&#146;s smile was far bigger than she intended. She almost ran into
        the bathroom. There she scrubbed every bit of makeup from her face and
        ensured her hands were clean. If only Lucy would come back and unlock
        the thick black collar, the harness and the tail-plug she would feel
        even better! It wasn&#146;t going to hinder her renascent nursing career.
        She put the white apron on, tied the strings in a bow at the small of
        her back and promptly returned to the surgery. 
      Dr. Schmidt pointed to the collar, thinking maybe Kate had forgotten
        to remove it. 
      &#147;It&#146;s locked on.&#148; Kate explained, &#147;and so is this.&#148; She
        made a quick quarter-turn and stuck out her butt so the Doctor could
        see the tail curling jauntily out of her ass. He raised an eyebrow and
        mused on whether a tail could be made part of her new nurse&#146;s uniform. 
      Ponygirl Linda, stripped of her harness and boots, sat up in bed with
        her wrists handcuffed to the sides of the bed frame. Kate comforted her
        as the doctor manipulated her ankle, but the pain appeared to be the
        least of her problems. 
      &#147;I can&#146;t believe it,&#148; Linda said to Kate, &#147;first
        Ray has an accident and now this. It&#146;s the eve of the competition
        and both our teams are out of it!&#148; 
      Kate didn&#146;t realize that the ponygirls took this so seriously. &#147;They
        lock you up in harness, whip you and make you run and haul stuff all
        over the island. What does it matter about a stupid competition?&#148; 
      The doctor gave an admonishing cough and looked at Kate disapprovingly. 
      &#147;It&#146;s pride, Kate. Don&#146;t you see? We&#146;re stuck here.
        It&#146;s our prison but it&#146;s also our home; whether we like it
        or not. I enjoy having something to work towards and the competition
        is it. Now all the practice that Karita and Riccardo have done is wasted...
        Yeeeeeoooow!&#148;  
      &#147;Did it hurt when I did that?&#148; The doctor asked, feeling Linda&#146;s
        ankle.&#148; 
      &#147;Yes. Quite a lot,&#148; the ponygirl replied calmly, without a
        hint of sarcasm. 
      &#147;A bad strain. We&#146;ll get you strapped up. You won&#146;t be
        running for a while. Riccardo will have to find himself another pony.&#148; 
      &#147;THAT&#146;S IT!&#148; Kate shouted excitedly, &#147;Why can&#146;t
        Riccardo drive Jessica and Debbie. At least we&#146;d have an entrant
        in the competition.&#148; 
      Linda agreed. Even Dr Schmidt was obliged to agree, although he couldn&#146;t
        quite match Kate&#146;s level of enthusiasm. Nevertheless he picked up
        the internal phone and made the call. 
      FINAL PRACTICE 
      Jessica and Debbie were in the jacuzzi recovering from their arduous
        day at the end of Tony&#146;s reins. They were still annoyed about being
        punished with six lashes because of his incompetent driving. They joked
        that even Kate had been a better driver. Their laughter was interrupted
        by an announcement from the tannoy system: 
      &#147;Ponygirls Jessica and debbie. Harness in ten minutes.&#148; 
      It had been a long and hard day already. The thought of being harnessed
        again just so Tony could fulfil his pony driver ambitions filled them
        with dread. For the second time that day they prepared themselves for
        the harness. 
      Jessica and Debbie were standing ready in their preparation chains when
        Riccardo arrived. He soon had them harnessed up and out on the training
        course. As the drivers never bother to speak to the ponygirls, (aside
        from a few horsy style encouragements) they were left to conclude for
        themselves that Riccardo was training them for the dressage. 
      All became clearer soon after when Frank appeared in the ring, fresh
        from delivering the day&#146;s corrective strokes to his ponygirls. 
      &#147;Take &#145;em through a trot first. I&#146;ll run along side.&#148; Frank
        shouted out. With two drivers talking together it became much easier
        for the eavesdropping ponygirls to figure out what they were expected
        to do. 
      They did exactly as Frank said. Then they did it again... and again
        and again. There was still the high stepping to be practiced. Jessica
        and Debbie, although quite pretty as far as ponygirls go, were built
        for speed and power - even before they started on Dr. Schmidt&#146;s
        steroid regimen. They would never compete with some of the ponies that
        looked like they&#146;d come from the Folie Bergere. 
      Frank took a firm whip to their thighs knowing they could lose valuable
        points. &#147;Knee..up..kick..out..foot..down..knee up..kick..out..foot..down&#148; 
      Fireworks launched the first evening of the festival. It was a compelling
        spectacle of diverse and deviant entertainment. As the island&#146;s
        bunnies were unwillingly providing much of the entertainment, their opinion
        might have been different. Jessica wished she was there instead of high
        stepping around a track. She found herself wondering who was sat kneeling
        chained to Master Alex&#146;s chair, and that wayward attention cost
        her a sharp rap on her thigh. 
      &#147;Knee..up..kick..out..foot..down..knee up..kick..out..foot..down&#148; 
      The training eventually finished. Jessica and Debbie were returned to
        an almost empty pony quarters. Only the forlorn figure of Linda, with
        her strapped up ankle, was there waiting for them. 
      Riccardo and Frank went in search of a couple of well-deserved after-work
        beers and a quick peek at the festival activities.

      from Rabbit Island. She reaches the port and checks into a hotel. 
       
      SWORD SWALLOWING 
      Madame Cervoix&#146;s &#147;Oral Skills for Slavegirls&#148; class had
        an early start this morning. With all the festivities planned it would
        be a long and exhausting day for ponygirls and bunnies alike. 
      Jessica, Kate, Eva and Suchita were classmates again, and after yesterday&#146;s
        shared experience a friendly rapport had developed between them. They
        were fixed up in the same way as yesterday - each was kneeling on the
        wooden floor, her hands cuffed behind her and chained to the floor between
        her feet. The anal motivators were in place, the cold steel cylinder
        nestling deep within the rectum of each student. The four talked quietly,
        awaiting their teacher&#146;s arrival. 
      Even though the anal motivators had delivered a surprisingly nasty punishment
        yesterday, the students all agreed on how nice Madame Cervoix was. Somehow,
        because she was never in the room when the punishing shocks were delivered,
        they didn&#146;t hold her responsible for their pain. 
      Cervoix had a charming personality, more like a respected college lecturer
        than a domineering slave mistress. She treated her students with a surprising
        degree of respect too, able to ignore the fact that her students were
        in chains and lived as slaves. She was always complimenting them: Jessica
        on her lustrous dark hair, Kate on her breasts and cute smile, Eva on
        her smoldering Latin eyes, and Suchita on her beautiful face. It was
        a clever technique for winning over her students and made them want to
        please her all the more. 
      &#147;Good morning class.&#148; Madame Cervoix said cheerily upon her
        arrival. The students reciprocated the greeting in unison, as if they
        were back at school. She looked as immaculately dressed up and made up
        as she was yesterday; her pinstripe skirt and suit jacket making her
        look every inch the sexy businesswoman.  
      Cervoix walked slowly behind her four kneeling students, bending down
        to check that the handcuffs were chained securely to the floor and that
        the anal motivators were properly inserted and switched on. She paused
        to gaze at Kate&#146;s bare back. It was criss-crossed with light welt
        marks. 
      &#147;...And how is our Kate feeling this morning?&#148; She asked,
        obviously teasing. Suchita and Eva chuckled. &#147;You really made quite
        an impression last night!&#148; 
      Jessica sensed that she missed something the previous evening. Kate
        bit down on her bottom lip and glanced across at her friend with a sheepish
        smile. 
      &#147;Why? What happened?&#148; Jessica inquired, just as the others
        hoped she would. 
      Suchita was bouncing on her heels, eager to recount the story. 
      &#147;First there was a competition where the five pussy-girls wear
        strap-on dildos and have their hands tied behind them... and they&#146;re
        ball-gagged too&#133; 
      &#147;And there&#146;s a line of naked girls bent right over a fence
        rail, standing with their legs tied apart. It&#146;s a race where the
        pussy-girls were supposed to pump the dildo into each of the bunnies&#146; vaginas
        ten times, then run back to the finishing line in the fastest time, but...&#148; the
        Indian woman&#146;s voice cracked up with laughter at her recollection. 
      &#147;...But Kate&#146;s dildo kept missing the hole on the first girl!&#148; Eva
        giggled, taking up the story. &#147;She must have been trying for a minute
        or two, the dildo bobbing around in front of her. She got madder and
        madder until she was jumping up and down and moaning behind her gag at
        everyone. It just made them laugh more and more.&#148; 
      &#147;...Then,&#148; Suchita resumed, &#147;a man gave her a helping
        hand and made Kate put it up the asshole of one girl. Kate pumped away
        regardless of the poor girl&#146;s protests. She finally managed to fuck
        all five girls but it must have taken fives minutes. Honestly, some people
        were laughing so hard I thought they might collapse!&#148; 
      Judging by the giggles in the room as they told of Kate&#146;s misadventure,
        the fun hadn&#146;t only been enjoyed by the Masters. Kate shrugged her
        shoulders at Jessica and gave here one of those &#145;so what&#146; looks,
        as if to say &#145;they wanted amusement and they got it&#146;. 
      But that wasn&#146;t the end last night&#146;s escapades... 
      &#147;And then later in the evening there was that whipping competition,&#148; Suchita
        continued, &#147;where the first woman to orgasm is the winner.&#148;  
      Kate looked down, studying her large, still lactating, nipples, as she
        often did when feeling embarrassed. 
      &#147;First they tie the woman&#146;s hands to the top corners of a
        wooden frame that looks like a door frame, and she is made to kneel on
        the ground. There&#146;s a long dildo pointing upwards from the bottom
        of the frame and she&#146;s lowered onto it so it&#146;s inside her...&#148; 
      &#147;And they were all blindfolded as well,&#148; Eva chipped in. 
      Suchita continued, becoming more animated. &#147;So there are four of
        them in a row, kneeling in their frames. Each has a man who&#146;s her
        teammate. The whistle goes, and each guy is allowed three minutes to
        put his girl in the mood, so they are all kissing them, playing with
        their breasts and such. It really was quite sexy! 
      &#147;Then the whistle blows again and now they are only allowed to
        touch their girl by whipping them. They are soft whips, like a flogger,
        but some of them are still whipping the women quite hard. They can whip
        them in any way they want, just enough to make the girls go up and down
        on the dildo&#133; 
      &#147;So these four women in their frames are moving up and down like
        crazy, and everyone is cheering for them, and Kate&#146;s lovely breasts
        are bouncing everywhere, and of course I&#146;m cheering for Kate as
        well, and she&#146;s making all these sexy noises. The guys keep whipping
        the four of them faster and faster and the women are all going mad with
        passion. Then Kate screams and screams as she has the first orgasm. Everyone
        cheered as she kept screwing herself on the dildo as she came a second
        time&#133; 
      &#147;She was the winner, of course! The guy whipping her was awarded
        a big bottle of champagne. He shook it and sprayed all over Kate and
        the other girls.&#148; 
      Jessica smiled broadly, congratulating Kate on her victory, although
        she wondered whether such undignified behavior really deserved congratulations.
        She asked Kate, curiously, who was partnering her in Ray&#146;s absence. 
      &#147;Master Alex,&#148; Kate replied.  
      Kate immediately noticed an instant change of expression, almost like
        bewilderment, on Jessica&#146;s face. It seemed to shock her. Kate broke
        the stony silence a few moments later. &#147;Anyway Jessi - the good
        news from last night is that they told me I can stay in the medical suite.
        I&#146;m a pussy-girl now!&#148; 
      Jessica was annoyed with herself. How could she have formed such an
        irrational attachment to Master Alex? Surely Kate&#146;s well being,
        and the fact that she would soon be living nearby, was more important
        than her relationship with that overeducated slave trader!  
      
         *** 
       
      Kate and Jessica&#146;s awkward scene presented a good moment for Madame
        Cervoix to call her students to order. The laughing and joking had ended.  
      The lesson began with a brief review of what they learned yesterday.  
      &#147;Tell me, Eva. What is the correct attitude for a slave-girl prior
        to fellatio?&#148; Madame Cervoix began. 
      &#147;My eyes tell him how much I desire to have his penis filling my
        mouth.&#148; 
      &#147;Very good! If you are kneeling like you are now, you must remember
        to raise your eyes to him, but not your head. What do you want him to
        see, Suchita?&#148; 
      &#147;The whites of my eyes showing below the irises.&#148; 
      &#147;That&#146;s right. You have beautiful submissive eyes. You must
        use them to show that you are submitting to him. Kate, please demonstrate
        that to us.&#148; 
      Kate nodded, then looked upwards towards the face of a famous British
        sportsman. She licked her lips, opened her mouth, and extended her tongue
        slightly. Then she leant forward so that the erect phallus slipped sensuously
        into her wet mouth, and looked upwards again as she started to move over
        the head of the penis. &#147;Excellent technique Kate!&#148; Madame Cervoix
        proclaimed. 
      &#147;In today&#146;s class we will learn about sword-swallowing, otherwise
        known as deep-throating. You may have heard negative things said about
        it or even had bad experiences yourself, but when it&#146;s done right,
        this can be extremely satisfying for the slave-girl as well as her Master.
        Let&#146;s start with Kate as she is already warmed up.&#148; 
      Mme Cervoix stood behind Kate, instructing her to keep sucking on the
        phallus. She positioned her hands firmly on each side of Kate&#146;s
        face, gradually changing the angle so that Kate felt the phallus&#146;s
        head against the back of her throat. Then lifting Kate&#146;s chin as
        she continued to work on it, Kate felt the phallus being forced down
        into her throat. She gagged on it, as Cervoix expected, but the teacher
        held her head so that the phallus lodged further and further within her.. 
      &#147;Push right up to the base Kate.&#148; Mme Cervoix encouraged. &#147;That&#146;s
        it, nice and slow!&#148; 
      Kate&#146;s straightened her back and pushed herself upwards despite
        the resistance in her throat. The tip of her nose made contact with the
        base of the phallus unit. A red LED light came on, triggered by a pressure
        sensor. She&#146;d made it! 
      &#147;Brava, Kate! Now hold it right there, and don&#146;t forget to
        breathe!&#148; 
      The three other students looked on with a mixture of horror and fascination.
        Kate was kneeling with her spine perfectly straight; head upturned and
        straining to keep the phallus fully down her throat, worried that she
        would gag on it at any moment. Madame Cervoix quickly wrapped a red silk
        cord several times around her neck then knotted it securely to a point
        on base of the phallus.  
      &#147;As you&#146;re still a beginner I&#146;ve tied the cord around
        your neck to help you hold it down,&#148; Madame Cervoix helpfully explained
        to Kate. 
      Eva and Suchita were next to sample the art of sword swallowing. It
        took a great deal of coaxing and cajoling, not to mention the threats,
        until they too found themselves in a hitherto unimagined position. A
        silk cord tied around the top of the neck ensured they stayed that way.
        Kate and Eva looked fairly relaxed with their predicament but Suchita
        was trembling and wide-eyed with fear. 
      Madame Cervoix laughed. &#147;Breathe, you stupid girl!&#148; 
      The teacher&#146;s attention turned to Jessica. Following a little personal
        coaching, she too was able to push her mouth fully onto the phallus.
        She felt the fat intruder burrowing insistently deep within her throat.
        It was a surprise and a relief to discover it wasn&#146;t as bad as she
        expected. She could breathe. &#147;You&#146;re a natural!&#148; Madame
        Cervoix was delighted to inform her. 
      Jessica couldn&#146;t help thinking of her next encounter with Master
        Alex. She could imagine his cock buried deep in her throat while he ran
        his fingers through her hair, as he liked to do. Lost in that thought,
        she scarcely noticed as Cervoix looped a cord around her neck and tied
        it tightly to the phallus. Jessica tried to pull herself off the phallus
        but felt the cord choking her. Something else was happening - something
        very disturbing. The more she pulled against the rope around her neck
        the more aroused she became. If only Madame Cervoix would run her hands
        over her pussy, Jessica knew she might be brought to orgasm there and
        then. 
      Madame Cervoix was observing Jessica&#146;s blushing skin and shallow
        breathing with admiration. It was so tempting to help take the girl over
        the edge, into a whole new realm of pleasure. But no, that honor would
        be reserved for the one who paid the bills. She knew Master Alex would
        be very pleased with Jessica&#146;s progress. 
      One of the great satisfactions for a teacher is when you witness the
        growth of your students. So it was for Madame Cervoix with the sight
        of four kneeling contemplative figures, each fitted with what she considered
        to be the ultimate gag. Their eyes nervously followed her as she walked
        around them, correcting their postures, stroking their hair. She ran
        a fingertip gently up and down the shapely bulge at the front of Suchita&#146;s
        neck. Suchita, responding to the tickling, attempted to swallow, causing
        her throat to grip the phallus even tighter. The Indian beauty looked
        more ravishing than ever. 
      Several minutes later, with only an occasional groan breaking the peaceful
        calm of the class, the students were becoming restless, wordlessly pleading
        with their teacher/mistress for release. Cervoix relented, untying them
        only because there was still much more to teach.  
      Their breakfast was served by the same method as yesterday. Cervoix
        loaded the food canisters in the base of the phalluses and switched them
        on. While she went for a sociable coffee and a croissant in the bar,
        the students hungrily set to work on their respective phalluses, sucking
        them with enthusiasm, each enjoying the bland, salty-sweet liquid that
        periodically squirted into their throats. 
      Madame Cervoix returned promptly from her coffee break to find four
        smug and satisfied students licking their lips and joking with each other.
        She wondered whether she had been too easy on them. That was easily rectified
        in the remaining hour of the class. 
      Cervoix declared herself very pleased with her students&#146; new abilities.
        Tomorrow, she announced, they would learn about the &#145;O-Box&#146;!
        This was one of Cervoix&#146;s recent inventions and was already proving
        to be a big success at the Rabbit Island festival.  
      She departed from her students while they were still cuffed and kneeling
        on the floor. There was just enough time for a lunch date with a rich
        admirer before her afternoon class. 
      The students remained kneeling, waiting anxiously for the grades. Kate
        had something troubling her that she wanted to talk to Jessica about. &#147;Last
        night at the festival, Jessica. I know I was kind of busy, but I didn&#146;t
        see or hear anything about Nancy. In fact, nobody has seen anything of
        her for nearly two days. What do you suppose has happened?&#148; 
      Jessica, rather than being concerned about her college pal, seemed thrilled
        by the news. &#147;With any luck she&#146;s escaped. Nancy&#146;s a smart
        girl you know! She may have already alerted the authorities. Jesus, Katie!
        We could all be free within the week.&#148; Jessica tugged excitedly
        on her wrist chains that attached her to the floor. &#147;Free from bondage
        at last!&#148; 
      They became silent again as they contemplated that thought, and dreaded
        the imminent punishment of the anal motivator. For the duration of the
        class the electric probes deep inside them seemed benign, almost a pleasant
        feeling. But with the class over, they knew cool steel within them would
        at any moment deliver the first of many painful jolts.  
      The control panel sounded a beep. For a few moments there was a collective
        fearful whimpering and crying, knowing that their failings during class
        were about to be translated into voltage.  
      &#147;Yeeoowww!&#148; Their four-part cat&#146;s chorus had begun. 
      PONY CORSETRY 
      If there were a poll of Rabbit Island workers to nominate the most useful
        member of staff, Carole would surely win. As beautician, costume designer,
        and de facto &#145;house mother&#146; to many of the island&#146;s slavegirls
        she was always in demand, dealing with the demands of the Masters and
        the complaints of slavegirls with singular good grace. 
      &#147;It doesn&#146;t seem right - a ponygirl wearing a corset!&#148; Jessica
        remarked. 
      &#147;Jessica. You sound like Master Alex.&#148; Carole reprimanded
        her. &#147;Now breathe in and keep still. I need to get this thing laced
        up much tighter.&#148; 
      Carole tugged away on the laces at the back of Jessica&#146;s leather
        corset, while pussy-girl Lucy worked simultaneously on Debbie. The waist-cinching
        corset was giving a delightful definition to Jessica&#146;s waist and
        hips. 
      Fishnet stockings were next. Jessica and Debbie were allowed to put
        these on themselves. They smiled at each other as they did it - it was
        fun to get dressed up when, as ponygirls, they usual wore nothing but
        harnesses. Carole attached the stocking tops to the corsets and adjusted
        the stretchy garters to ensure a good fit. 
      Naturally, the ponygirls fitted their own boots, lacing them carefully
        up to just below the knee. They each stood up and walked around the room,
        making absolutely sure the boots were fitted snugly. They loved the comfort
        and the look of the pony-boots. With their high arched support and thick
        soles of the boots their resemblance to a pony&#146;s hoof was remarkable.
        Carole and Lucy felt relieved when the ponygirls sat down again. The
        tall, muscular ponygirls could seem quite intimidating.  
      Jessica and Debbie were also fitted with full-length kid leather gloves
        that laced up above the elbows. These were custom-made garments that
        held the hand in a tight fist shape. 
      Usually, the Rabbit Island ponygirls wear nothing around their necks,
        but today&#146;s costume included a leather band that laced up at the
        back of the neck to match the corset&#146;s lacing. It looked very sexy,
        Carole informed them, although the ponygirls were more concerned about
        its tight grip around their throats than how it looked. 
      Hair and make-up followed - Carole and Lucy&#146;s respective specialties.
        Poorly presented ponies would reflect badly on them, so they took considerable
        care and effort to ensure that they would look good and feel good. Even
        ponygirls sometimes like to be pampered! 
      Carole&#146;s final touches were red silk carnations attached to each
        nipple ring and another at the end to the ponygirl&#146;s plaited hair.  
      Because their fingers were already immobile within the long gloves Carole
        had to secure the ponygirls in the tack room to await their driver&#146;s
        arrival. She had just finished clicking the cuffs around Jessica&#146;s
        wrists when Riccardo and Frank arrived. 
      &#147;Jesus Christ!&#148; Riccardo exclaimed when he set eyes on Jessica
        and Debbie. 
      &#147;You like?&#148; said Carole. 
      &#147;Maybe too much! I have to concentrate on working these ponies
        for the next few hours. Good job I visited the O-Box earlier!&#148; 
      Frank and Riccardo fitted the dressage harnesses, their shiny black
        patent leather gleaming in the sunlight that flooded into the tack room
        through the skylight. The men were struck by how trim were the ponies&#146; corseted
        waists. They were able to tighten the harness belts a notch further than
        usual. The same shiny leather was used for the bridle straps that complimented
        so well the ponygirls&#146; glossy lips and black-lined eyes. With two
        experienced drivers at work, the ponygirls were soon reined, tailed and
        plumed. It was difficult for Riccardo to imagine that there would be
        any better ponygirls on display. 
      Once attached to the trap, a quick application of the whipper on their
        hind quarters had the ponygirls trotting smartly towards the dressage
        ring, the ponygirls&#146; long plaited manes with the red carnation at
        the end, bounced jauntily in the breeze. 
      They fell into line with five other pony pairs. All twelve stood perfectly
        still with ramrod posture, to await the judging of &#145;best turned
        out&#146; ponygirl.  
      Jessica no longer thought about the absurdity of her situation. When
        bound, bitted and harnessed to a cart, life seemed simpler, avoiding
        her driver&#146;s displeasure and the whip he wielded was all that mattered.
        Being a &#145;dumb harnessed animal&#146; actually required a surprising
        degree of concentration. 
      INSPECTION 
      Although the blinkers restricted her view, Jessica could hear the judge
        approaching from the side. Suddenly she was standing in front of Jessica.
        The judge was a slim middle-aged woman, immaculate in fawn breeches and
        red riding coat. She looked Jessica straight in the eye with a severe
        expression as if trying to see inside her. Jessica stared straight ahead
        as she had been trained. &#145;Never, ever, look a human in the eye,&#146; was
        one of the fundamental ponygirl rules. 
      The judge glanced at Jessica&#146;s details on a clipboard. &#147;How
        long has this one been a pony?&#148;  
      &#147;Three months.&#148; Riccardo answered. 
      &#147;That&#146;s quite young to be entering a competition like this.
        I notice that she still tugs against her harness straps. Ponies should
        have that beaten out of them while they&#146;re still young. So, tell
        me more about her.&#148; 
      Riccardo seemed more nervous than Jessica was. &#147;Ponygirl Jessica
        has developed very well physically. She is a hard worker and extremely
        loyal. Although strong willed, her intelligence makes her easy to train.
        She is now performing to a high standard and requires very little correction.
        She&#146;s sociable and much loved by her peers and seniors alike. She
        is prone to seriousness, although is seldom depressed.&#148; 
      Jessica thought Riccardo&#146;s was a fair assessment, and uncannily
        similar to a review a former boss in New York had once written about
        her. 
      The judge cast her eyes up and down Jessica&#146;s almost-perfect pony
        body. Her finger toyed with one of Jessica&#146;s ringed nipple with
        its two reins and red silk carnation attached. She scrawled a few notes
        on her clipboard. &#147;Quite lovely,&#148; she muttered to herself as
        she moved to the next ponygirl pair. 
      They looked striking - taller and leaner than Jessica and Debbie. Unlike
        Jessica&#146;s traditional ponygirl headgear these wore latex half-hoods
        that covered their hair and eyes. The protruding edges of their small
        eye holes meant that blinkers were not needed. That, and their black
        latex body suits gave them a sleek and streamlined appearance. Some visitors
        thought they looked very sexy, but the ponygirl traditionalists were
        appalled. 
      The only hints of color on these ponygirls were their shiny red lips.
        The judge was looking between them as the driver explained the new &#145;permanent
        T bit&#146; design. It necessitated the removal of the ponygirl&#146;s
        back teeth, bonding-in a bit piece and piercing of her tongue. He reassured
        the judge that it was hygienic and that the tongue depressor bar could
        be removed if required. 
      Tantalizingly displayed through a cutout in the latex garment, were
        the ponies&#146; labia. The cutout was just large enough to show that
        their sex was hairless. It was their only skin visible below the neck.
        The labia were as red and shiny as their upper lips.  
      Something else caught the eye of the judge - their long blonde tails,
        fitted in the usual butt-plug fashion and cascading down towards each
        ponygirl&#146;s knees. It seemed softer and not as straight as normal
        pony hair. The pony driver confirmed her impression that it was human
        hair. 
      DRESSAGE 
      The dressage competition took place in the fenced corral behind where
        the ponygirls were arrayed. Jessica and Debbie could only listen to the
        polite clapping that signified the end of each routine. The trap creaked
        and shifted a little as Riccardo took his seat. The ponygirls became
        alert - ready to move at the instant he gave a signal. 
      He tugged on the reins causing both nipples to be pulled upwards. The
        ponygirls walked forward, happy to be moving at last. 
      A rapid repeated tug on the right rein and they turned right until the
        tugged ceased. 
      Riccardo pressed the a button on the small panel in front of him making
        the whipper slash at his ponies&#146; buttocks. They immediately started
        to trot and would not deviate from it unless Riccardo signaled them to
        do so. 
      Another tug on the right-hand reins, and they turned to the right again.
        They had entered the corral and could see people leaning on the wooden
        fence posts attentively watching the ponies&#146; every move. 
      Riccardo drove them back and forth sometimes trotting, sometimes galloping.
        It required all Jessica&#146;s concentration to react correctly to Riccardo&#146;s
        instructions as well as keeping in perfect sync with Debbie. 
      It all went very smoothly until the transition to the high-stepping
        phase caught them out. They misunderstood Riccardo&#146;s signal and
        took a few faltering steps before falling into step again. Riccardo knew
        he&#146;d lost some valuable strokes. Polite applause accompanied their
        exit from the ring. 
      After all six pony-pairs had competed there was a break so the scores
        were calculated. The ponygirls were unhitched from the traps and led
        to the punishment rail. They each had a slipped loop of leather dropped
        around the neck and tightened, then they were bent over the rail and
        the trailing end of the loop attached to the frame near to the ground. 
      Jessica and Debbie each felt the number 8 written large across a buttock.
        It meant they were eight strokes behind the current leader. Therefore
        the leading pony driver was entitled to deliver up to eight strokes on
        his competitors&#146; ponygirls. 
      The multi-stranded flogger smacked down hard on Jessica&#146;s buttocks.
        There was every incentive for the driver to make the strokes hurt in
        order to weaken the opposition. Luckily the flogger was designed to cause
        only light wounds. Which isn&#146;t to say it didn&#146;t hurt, particularly
        if it was lashed hard. 
      After being punished for their failures (except for the leading pair)
        the ponygirls were taken to various parts of the ground and chained to
        trees. The rules were strict, only the bridles were permitted for removal,
        so that they could be fed and watered. 
      Pussy-girl Sara came over to where Jessica and Debbie were kneeling,
        still fully harnessed, in the shade of a tree. She carried water and
        a bowl of crudit&#233;s. &#147;You did very well,&#148; she encouraged
        them as she offered the food, but the ponygirls were downhearted following
        their beating. 
      &#147;You can easily come back from eight strokes. I&#146;ve seen it
        done before.&#148; Sara said optimistically. &#147;Most of the other
        ponygirls here are just toys. Very beautiful and elegant, but they can&#146;t
        live with you in all round ability. Only Madame Cavallo&#146;s ponies
        are anywhere near your standard.&#148; 
      &#147;The tall ones?&#148; Jessica asked. 
      &#147;Yeah. Both her pony pairs are six-footers. The black pair look
        like the poor twins of the Williams sisters! They&#146;re a couple of
        strokes ahead of you but Cavallo wasn&#146;t pleased with their performance.
        I just saw her beating them again. Her other pony pair look amazing in
        their latex body suits. Here&#146;s a little gossip: I heard a rumor
        that their tails are made from their own hair! Aren&#146;t you glad you
        belong to Rabbit Island and not her?&#148; 
      They had to agree. If there was one thing Jessica had learnt it was
        that there were worse places to be than Rabbit Island. The regular beatings
        that formed part of a ponygirl&#146;s routine were nothing compared to
        the fear of being shipped elsewhere. 
      BUNNY HAULING 
      The afternoon&#146;s pony event required a lot of rope, twenty-four
        bunnies and twenty-four large sacks of sand.  
      Kate, although now the probationary nurse, was enlisted to make up the
        bunny numbers. She was actually glad to be back in the thick of the action,
        surrounded by old friends. Like the rest of the bunnies, her hands were
        rope-tied behind her, then a doubled up rope was passed around her waist
        and tightly up between her legs snagging her bound wrists in the small
        of her back. It was a classic Japanese crotch and wrist tie - erotic
        and effective. The six-foot long end of the crotch rope trailed along
        the ground behind her and was tied off to a large sack of sand. 
      After being made to lie down amongst the other naked and similarly bound
        bunnies, Kate&#146;s ankles were lashed together with a dozen loops of
        rope. With that amount of wrapping she knew her ankles would soon be
        taking the strain. An upside down suspension she supposed, although there
        was nothing in the vicinity that they could dangle from!  
      None of the bunnies were gagged, which meant that the bunnies were permitted
        to talk. There was quiet chatter in the air, as the row of bunnies brought
        each other up to date with previous night&#146;s torments and other gossip.
        Kate was deep in thought, squinting up at the sunny clear blue sky, almost
        enjoying the tightness of her crotch rope, which seemed to have been
        tied &#145;just right&#146;. She heard a vaguely familiar voice next
        to her. 
      &#147;Kate?&#148; 
      She turned her head to see Karen Galtz, the erstwhile journalist, lying
        next to her, trussed up just as she was. &#147;Karen! How are you?&#148; 
      &#147;Exhausted, aching and mad as hell. You have no idea what these
        bastards have done to me in the last couple of days.&#148; 
      &#147;I probably do.&#148; Kate replied honestly. She had to admit that
        Karen did look the worse for wear. &#147;Listen Karen, I&#146;m really
        sorry you got caught. Do you know what they plan to do with you?&#148; 
      &#147;They say I&#146;m to become a beach bunny, permanently naked and
        handcuffed. I can&#146;t bear it.&#148; She wriggled in frustration and
        anger, unable to reconcile her fondness of casual play bondage with living
        as a perpetual non-consensual slave. 
      A handler was walking along the row of bound females. &#147;Quiet now!&#148; He
        brought his long cane down hard onto the front of their thighs. It stung
        like hell.  
      The ponygirls were being brought onto the field cheered on by an excited
        crowd of visitors taking their positions along the corral fence. The
        pony traps were backed up so that they were in a row in front of the
        bunnies bound ankles. Four bunnies were tied to the tow-bars on each
        trap. 
      The afternoon's competition was a test of the ponygirls&#146; strength
        and determination, and the cruelty of their respective drivers too. The
        rules of this game were simple - it was a race to the finishing line,
        or more likely, go as far the ponies could before collapsing from exhaustion.
        Dragging four females across a field was not such a hard task in itself,
        that was why each bunny had a sack of sand as ballast dragging behind
        each of them, pulling heavily on the crotch rope to which it was tied. 
      The whole area seemed to go quiet for just a few seconds. Then an air-horn
        blew. The race had started. 
      The drivers&#146; whips were flying. The visitors yelled for their favorites,
        while the bunnies yelped and howled as their asses were dragged across
        the lawn. 
      Jessica felt the repeated sting of the electric whipper on her bare
        buttocks. Riccardo wasn&#146;t holding back. No matter how much she resented
        it and wanted to rebel against it, she always kept going. The drivers
        often said it was the only language a ponygirl understood! Besides, a
        ponygirl is loyal and never wants to let her pony pair down. The howls
        of the bunnies she was dragging behind her mattered little to Jessica
        at such a time. 
      Jessica and Debbie leaned forward as much as their harnessing permitted
        and concentrated on putting on their power into their muscular thighs.
        Gradually a faltering stride developed between them. They were in step
        and heading past the halfway point - their healthy hearts pumping strongly. 
      Jessica recognized a shrill, almost hysterical voice calling her name
        from the spectators&#146; area. It had to be Carole! Then another voice...
        she&#146;d be damned if that wasn&#146;t Madame Cervoix calling her name!
        She couldn&#146;t help responding to such welcome encouragement. 
      The ponygirls&#146; blinkers made it impossible to see the positions
        of their competitors unless one was well out in front. None were in Jessica&#146;s
        view, but it was still possible that others were heading them, hidden
        out to the side of their vision. 
      Jessica could feel the build-up of lactic acid as her muscles screamed
        for oxygen. She sensed Debbie alongside her, felt the same. The last
        ten yards seemed like a mile. The whipper was on its highest setting,
        normally used only for punishment, as if Riccardo was squeezing every
        last drop of energy from them. It hurt like hell but they knew he wouldn&#146;t
        do that unless it was necessary. 
      Almost staggering, they crossed the chalk dust finishing line, but the
        whipping on their buttocks continued for a few yards more, until the
        pony trap&#146;s wheels were also over the line. Jessica and Debbie dropped
        to their knees and gasped for breath. 
      Kate and Karen, lying tightly bound behind a pony trap, also gasped
        for breath. Being dragged over rough grassland and in turn, hauling a
        bag of sand from a crotch rope can do that to a girl. Despite the pummeling
        their asses had taken on the rough grassy surface, they still managed
        a smile - feeling highly pleased with themselves. 
      It had been Kate&#146;s idea. When the pony driver mounted the traps
        just before the race, Kate had seen that it wasn&#146;t Riccardo seated
        in front of them. She and Karen agreed to make a little effort on Jessica&#146;s
        behalf. They both grabbed hold on the long tufts of grass that came into
        their hands as they were dragged along. They didn&#146;t let go until
        the clumps of grass were uprooted. It was hard to know exactly what effect
        their efforts had but they were pretty sure of something - Jessica and
        Debbie had won the race by just one yard. 
      The ponygirls were led back to the whipping rail. With a 3 marked on
        her buttock Jessica knew she&#146;d done well, now just three strokes
        behind the leader, but didn&#146;t know that Kate&#146;s spoiling tactics
        had made a valuable contribution.

      THE O-GAG 
      (Jessica and Kate) 
       
      The four students in Madame Cervoix&#146;s &#145;Oral Skills for Slavegirls&#146; class
        were awaiting the start of the third lecture. They were in their usual
        positions - kneeling on the floor, naked, chained and plugged with the
        fiendish anal motivators. They talked quietly, as they were permitted
        to do so. 
      Suchita and Eva were discussing the operation that both had had since
        becoming slavegirls - the removal of the prepuce. Eva had also been subjected
        to a labiaplasty - the trimming of her labia - to create a very neat
        and attractive outer appearance to her sex. 
      &#147;Since the operation,&#148; Suchita complained, &#147;my clitoris
        is constantly on display. In fact my Master calls it HIS clitoris. I&#146;m
        so ashamed of how easily I am aroused. Sometimes when I&#146;m locked
        in my hanging cage he&#146;ll just blow on it as he walks past me. It
        makes me horny, but with my hands fixed behind my back I can&#146;t do
        anything about it. Actually I&#146;m glad my hands are tied, otherwise
        I would just play with myself until I cum.&#148; 
      Eva gave her Indian friend a sympathetic look. She understood all too
        well what her friend was going through. Her own protruding clitoris was
        pierced laterally with a titanium ring. It was the focal point of her
        hairless and cut back sex.  
      &#147;I have the same problem. My Master calls this &#145;the Devil&#146;s
        piercing&#146;. It drives me crazy. I&#146;m always thinking of it, always
        secretly wishing that somebody would touch it. Sometimes he locks a long
        chain to it and uses it to secure me to something. One time he even chained
        me to the maid&#146;s vacuum cleaner and I had to follow her around the
        house while she cleaned. 
      Today, as a punishment for a minor infraction from last night, Eva&#146;s
        master had fitted her with a crotch tie. A thin leather cord went around
        her waist then tightly front to back between her legs. The cord went
        down through Eva&#146;s clit ring pressing hard against her clitoris
        and deep between her labia. It was no wonder she was looking hot and
        bothered! 
      Jessica and Kate listened to their fellow students with sympathy, curiosity
        (and secretly a little amusement). They leaned forward in their chains,
        trying to get a closer look at their fellow students&#146; modified genitals.  
      The drugs regime at Rabbit Island already kept its captives horny enough.
        The idea of a ponygirl without a clit hood made Jessica shiver with fear,
        yet she felt a tingle of excitement too. 
      &#147;I wonder what&#146;s happened to Nancy.&#148; Kate said idly to
        Jessica, intent on changing the subject. 
      Jessica shook her head. &#147;Who knows where she is? I just hope she
        is far away from here and planning how to get us off the island.&#148; 
      &#147;Did you say Nancy?&#148; Suchita interjected. The name sounded
        familiar to her. &#147;Last night, when I was sucking my Master under
        the dining table, I heard them talking about a girl seen taking a taxi
        from the port. They said she matched Nancy&#146;s description.&#148; 
      &#147;She&#146;s made it!&#148; Jessica and Kate said in unison. They
        leaned towards each other and kissed. If they weren&#146;t chained to
        the floor with long metal plugs in their asses they would have been dancing
        around the room.  
      &#147;She&#146;s made it! She&#146;s made it!&#148; Jessica continued
        to sing happily to no particular tune. &#147;She won&#146;t let us down,
        Katie. Nancy never lets her friends down!&#148; 
      &#147;Apparently the handlers will be setting off after her early tomorrow,&#148; Suchita
        regretted to inform them. &#147;They plan to intercept her before she
        arrives at the American consulate.&#148;  
      Just as Jessica was pressing Suchita for more details they heard the
        ominous yet alluring footsteps of their teacher. After becoming progressively
        louder, the footsteps suddenly ceased and the classroom door opened. 
      Madame Cervoix entered the room looking as splendid as ever. Today she
        wore a formal jacket and a below-the-knee skirt, both in black kid leather.
        Her white satin blouse with a narrow red leather tie was striking; the
        red tie perfectly matched the red of her lips. Fishnet stocking and high-heeled
        ankle boots in shiny patent black, complemented her ensemble. 
      Even were she not kneeling in chains at Cervoix's feet, Jessica might
        still have felt inferior to this woman! 
      Madame Cervoix, beautiful, immaculately dressed, worldly-wise, charming
        and kind, was a successful person. In contrast, Jessica was a slave and
        a failure. A beautiful and well-trained ponygirl, yet still a failure.
        She might be good at hauling people and produce around the island but
        little else! 
      Cervoix held up four leather straps, each with a two-inch diameter leather
        ring in it. &#147;You&#146;ve all seen one of these before?&#148; 
      They nodded miserably. Ring-gags were a regular fixture for all of them. 
      &#147;Good, then let&#146;s put them where they belong. Open wide!&#148; 
      None gave any resistance as Cervoix fitted their gaping mouths with
        the leather rings, breezily buckling the straps tightly at the back of
        their heads as if she&#146;d done it a thousand times before - which
        of course she had. 
      &#147;Now. Just because you are ring-gagged it doesn&#146;t mean you
        can&#146;t still use the techniques I&#146;ve taught you. Let&#146;s
        start with a five-minute warm up. Take your phallus in your mouth, then
        suck and tease it until I tell you to stop.&#148; 
      Her four students leaned forward towards the phalluses fixed to the
        vertical stands in front of them. Trying to remember every little detail
        that Madame Cervoix had taught them, they lavished their attentions on
        their imitation penises as if they were long-lost friends.  
      Cervoix walked around her kneeling quartet of students, analyzing their
        skills, gently correcting minor flaws in their technique as she focused
        on each of them in turn. She noted with satisfaction that all four were
        displaying signs of arousal; their skin flushing and clammy to the touch,
        pupil&#146;s dilating. She noticed glistening moisture on Kate&#146;s
        shaven sex. It was no less than she had expected. 
      &#147;Last one to swallow the sword gets five jolts added to her score!&#148; Cervoix
        announced as if it were a children&#146;s game. 
      Five extra jolts! She didn&#146;t need to repeat the statement; her
        students understood the implications only too well. They had all the
        incentive they needed for pushing their mouths fully onto their phalluses.
        Without Cervoix&#146;s expert hands guiding them, it was proving difficult.
        The sound of coughing and gagging accompanied their efforts. 
      Jessica straightened her spine and tilted her neck. At first it seemed
        an impossible task, but she would rather risk choking that have five
        more painful jolts. She felt the narrow girth of the phallus plunging
        in her throat as if she was a heron with a fish. She slowly pushed herself
        upwards, her nose edging closer and closer to the sensor at the top of
        the phallus. With a peculiar satisfaction she felt the tip of her nose
        touch against the sensor. A small LED light switched on to confirm her
        success. 
      She held her position, and looked out the corner of her right eye to
        see how the others were fairing. Kate was already done judging by her
        own motionless pose. 
      &#147;Okay! Hold it in your throat that for two minutes! You may move
        up and down the phallus if you feel confident you won&#146;t gag. Try
        to swallow. The feeling of your neck muscles clenching on his penis will
        drive your Masters crazy.&#148; 
      They&#146;d all succeeded with the task, but Cervoix didn&#146;t announce
        which one of them was last to complete it. That would ruin the surprise
        at punishment time! 
      Cervoix seemed satisfied with her students&#146; progress. Charging
        such exorbitant fees meant that she had to deliver real results. The
        four students in this class would give untold pleasure for years to come.
        If one divided her fee by the years of pleasure that a slave-girl might
        provide, she reasoned, it represented excellent value for money. 
      THE O-BOX 
      (Jessica and Kate) 
       
      For the final part of the class, Cervoix had something very special
        planned. Her own invention, the &#145;O-Box&#146;, had already been a
        big success at the festival. One of the pussy-girls, Sally - a former
        Cervoix pupil, had been very busy this last couple of days as its primary
        occupant. 
      Madame Cervoix had prepared a short video of Sally and the O-Box in
        action. She dimmed the lights.  
      The screen showed a small, nicely decorated alcove within the main hall
        of the Lodge. There was a wooden box, the height of a seat and the width
        of a woman&#146;s shoulders. From the top surface of the box protruded
        a woman&#146;s head. She would have to be seated with her thighs up against
        her chest in order to fit inside the box.  
      The camera zoomed in to show Sally&#146;s beautiful head. Her face and
        hair were exotically made up to scream &#145;sex&#146;. She wore a leather
        collar below which was fitted a leather gaiter sealed around the hole
        in the wood. It made her seem almost headless, or rather, bodiless. 
      In front of her nose was a small wooden block with a cut out U on top,
        and beyond that, a padded section - a seat. 
      A man came it to picture.  
      &#147;Shall I take off my pants?&#148; He asked Sally. 
      &#147;No need to Sir. Please take a seat and release your manhood for
        me.&#148; Sally&#146;s voice sounded confident, yet respectful. 
      The man pulled out his cock and balls fully from his fly and sat down
        so his crotch was inches away from Sally&#146;s face. 
      &#147;Please put your genitals fully through the loop, Sir,&#148; she
        politely instructed. 
      The wooden holder was perfectly shaped and positioned for the root of
        the man&#146;s shaft to rest on. He eased his flaccid cock and large
        testicles through the loop. Without warning, the cord fastened tightly,
        as if by magic. There seemed no way for him to extricate his tackle from
        the trap short of cutting his way out. With Sally&#146;s ravishing face
        just inches in front of him, combined with the tightness around his base
        of his cock, his erection was growing steadily. 
      Sally ignored it at that time; there was more preparation for her to
        do. &#147;Please slip your hands through the loops on either side of
        the box,&#148; she requested. 
      This was the stage that men feared most submitting themselves to a slave-girl.
        The man located the soft cord loops and wiggled his hands through each
        loop so they hung comfortably at his side. The cords pulled tight, the
        slack disappearing into the box. A cursory tug by the man confirmed he
        was secured. He'd been warned about it, but was still shocked to find
        himself at the mercy of a woman who herself was tied up inside the box
        on which he sat. 
      The tip of the man&#146;s cock seemed to stretch towards Sally&#146;s
        inviting lips. When she licked it with the tip if her tongue it grew
        a little more. She was teasing him very effectively. 
      For the man, the only thing in the world that mattered was having his
        cock deep in Sally&#146;s mouth. He thrust his loins towards her, but
        was halted by the cord around the base of his balls. It just made his
        erection stronger. The tip of her tongue touched the glans of his penis,
        as if coaxing it to a full erection. 
      To ask her to release him from the cords before shooting his load would
        make the man a laughing stock amongst his associates. To beg the girl
        in the box to suck him would be unbecoming for a Master! So he did what
        he was meant to do he sat back, watched and enjoyed as Sally&#146;s lips
        set to work. 
      She gave him the best blow-job of his life. 
      PONYGIRL EVENT 3: JOURNEY OF DARKNESS 
      (Jessica) 
       
      The five competing ponygirl-pairs were lined up for public viewing.
        Unlike yesterday&#146;s line-up for judging, this time anyone could inspect
        the ponygirls. Jessica and Debbie had almost perfected the art of standing
        motionless, staring ahead into space, while exploring fingers delved
        beneath their harnessing straps, pinching nipples, tickling their ribs,
        as if searching for the woman behind the pony. It might look like a woman
        beneath those straps, her body even responded to their teasing, yet the
        ponygirl seemed distant as if her thoughts were on something far away. 
      Jessica&#146;s thoughts were actually not so far away. She was thinking
        of her time in the O-Box just an hour earlier. She and the other three
        students were able to try their oral techniques out on a real people.
        It wouldn&#146;t have been right to let them loose on paying visitors
        but Madame Cervoix had recruited four Filipino gardeners. They were very
        glad they volunteered! 
      It left Jessica obsessed with the thought that she might soon be in
        the O-Box with Master Alex on the seat. She&#146;d had his cock in her
        mouth on many occasions, but always while hog-tied and ring-gagged. How
        would Master Alex, the control freak, feel if she were in control for
        once? To be at her mercy the same way that gardener was? She couldn&#146;t
        wait to find out! Suddenly the rubber ponygirl bit between her teeth
        tasted like Master Alex&#146;s cock! 
      A procession of visitors-cum-amateur ponygirl inspectors came and went
        - mostly men, oozing wealth and power. Jessica felt a peculiar kind of
        humiliation in the disdainful regard they showed to the ponygirls. 
      Occasionally a woman would accompany a man. Was she his wife or slave?
        Perhaps she was both. In either case, Jessica envied those women. She
        wouldn&#146;t so much mind being a slave to one man, providing he loved
        her and cared about her. That was all she ever wanted. 
      The sight of a woman harnessed up like a pony amused some visitors,
        particularly the women. It was the laughter of someone enjoying the misfortunes
        of others. They teased the ponygirls as if becoming a pony was their
        own fault, resulting no doubt from their own inadequacies as real women.
        Above all else, Jessica hated it when they laughed at her. She would
        sooner have a grim-faced man whipping her than a woman laughing at her. 
      A black-haired woman stood almost nose-to-nose with Jessica. She wasn&#146;t
        laughing. Suddenly the rubber bit that usually nestled so comfortably
        between Jessica&#146;s teeth seemed an irritation. The woman&#146;s piercing
        green eyes were looking straight through the ponygirl&#146;s defenses. 
      &#147;When you come up for auction I shall buy you.&#148; The woman
        said to Jessica. &#147;You can be sure of it.&#148; 
      She sidestepped towards ponygirl Debbie. &#147;You too!&#148; She said
        with a waggle of her finger and a crooked smile. 
      Debbie was ready for the woman. The otherworldly gaze of a ponygirl
        suddenly turned into a ferocious stare. Her urine started splashing down
        on the woman&#146;s boots, and bouncing up onto her white jodhpurs. 
      The woman frowned, barely able to suppress her anger. &#147;You won&#146;t
        get away with that when you're in my stables. I&#146;d kill you for less
        than that,&#148; she snarled through clenched teeth. 
      The threat unsettled Jessica. She was trembling; needing comfort and
        reassurance, most of all from Debbie, who seemed to take everything in
        her ponygirl stride. Comfort arrived in the shape of their driver, Riccardo. 
      &#147;Good morning, Madame Cavallo. How are you today?&#148; Riccardo
        cheerily greeted the woman. 
      &#147;Very well indeed, thank you Riccardo.&#148; The woman replied
        cordially. &#147;I was just admiring your splendid ponies.&#148;  
      She shook her left boot in the air, wrinkling her nose in mild disgust. &#147;One
        of them had a little accident.&#148; 
      Riccardo laughed. &#147;Terribly sorry. That&#146;s ponygirls for you
        - very difficult to tame. Best not to stand so close next time.&#148; 
      Madame Cavallo didn&#146;t share Riccardo&#146;s amusement. &#147;I
        don&#146;t know why you don&#146;t just catheterize her like I do to
        mine. Pop a tube up her urethra, drain her bladder before the competition,
        and then just clamp the tube. What could be easier?&#148; 
      &#147;Maybe I&#146;ll do that next time.&#148; Riccardo said dismissingly
        as Madame Cavallo walked towards her own much better trained ponygirls. 
      The elderly woman who judged the ponygirls yesterday came around again.
        She held a piece of cotton wool over each of Jessica&#146;s eyes then
        place a two-inch wide strip of tape over it, covering her face from eyebrow
        to mid-cheek. A firm pressure from the judge&#146;s hand on the tape
        made a tight seal to ensure that Jessica was completely blind. Not even
        the bright light of day could penetrate her eyes. Debbie received the
        same treatment in preparation for the next ponygirl trial: The Journey
        of Darkness. 
      Unlike yesterday&#146;s tests of elegance (in the Dressage) and strength
        (in the Bunny Hauling), the Journey of Darkness tested the driver&#146;s
        control and the ponygirls&#146; responsiveness to their driver. 
      It seemed a long wait for Jessica and Debbie, going fourth out of the
        five competitors. Riccardo stood close by chatting quietly to one of
        the handlers, something his ponygirls found very reassuring in their
        otherwise dark world. 
      The P.A. system crackled, then announced: &#147;The next entrants to
        run the Journey of Darkness are ponygirls Jessica and Debbie.&#148; 
      Riccardo immediately tugged on the reins. His ponygirls started to trot.
        The driver&#146;s experience was not very different to when the ponygirls
        were sighted, although in their darkness they had a tendency to slow
        up unless the whipper was regularly employed on their buttocks. 
      Jessica thought back to childhood holidays on Long Island, running along
        the beach with her eyes closed, counting the strides, fighting the urge
        to open her eyes. The beach was deserted; the worst that could happen
        was getting her feet wet in the shallow surf. Two hundred, she often
        counted, before the fear of darkness made the urge to open her eyes overwhelming.
        It always annoyed her that she was as safe from harm on the deserted
        beach as two hundred strides earlier. 
      Now Jessica had no trouble keeping her eyes closed. They were taped
        over. Nor could she stop running, or she&#146;d be whipped. As Riccardo
        guided his ponygirls through the complex maze of red and white road-cones
        in the corral, Jessica seemed more attuned to the slightest tug of the
        reins than if she were sighted. With the subtlest pull on her nipples
        Jessica would turn, when the whip lashed her buttocks she would immediately
        run faster. Just like on the Long Island beach she knew she would not
        come to harm. 
      The fifty-yard sprint that followed the last turn brought spontaneous
        applause from the crowd even before they had crossed the line. The cheers
        from the partisan home support became louder still. They had seen the
        time displayed on the digital scoreboard. 
      Despite Madame Cavallo&#146;s ponygirls&#146; performing very well,
        Jessica and Debbie had gained on them in the overall positions. It was
        a good result when, according to rumor, Cavallo&#146;s ponygirls were
        forced to run blind for days at a time leading up to the competition. 
      Jessica reveled in Riccardo&#146;s touch as his hand caressed her leather-strapped
        face. He tenderly peeled the heavy tape from her eyes, knowing by the
        smile of her bitted mouth that he had a surprisingly contented ponygirl
        on his hands. Jessica would tell Debbie about her Long Island childhood
        memory just as soon as they were free of their harnesses. Riccardo would
        never know why his ponygirl seemed so content. 
      PONYGIRL EVENT 4: THE GALLOP 
      (Jessica and Kate) 
       
      Riccardo stepped on the large weighing scales. 
      &#147;166 pounds!&#148; The official informed him. &#147;You can take
        that one.&#148; 
      &#145;That one&#146; was Kate. She was standing in a line with two other
        pussy girls and two thrill-seeking female visitors. At 108 pounds she
        would bring Riccardo&#146;s weight up to the racing weight. 
      Like the other volunteers in the line Kate&#146;s hands were already
        tied behind her, ready for action! 
      She looked pretty, Riccardo told her as they walked to the pony trap.
        And so she did, wearing the pussy-girls&#146; white tight-laced strapless
        bodice and long skirt. Her soft lactating breasts filled out the garment
        beautifully, as if they were battling to escape from the corset-like
        lacings. Riccardo lifted her up on to the seat and tied the loose end
        of the rope dangling from her wrists to the rail of the backrest. 
      Kate couldn&#146;t help but smile as Riccardo squeezed onto the seat
        beside her, his hip snug against hers. &#147;Your hands are tied to the
        rail but hold on tight in any case. If I say lean, you lean!&#148; Riccardo
        instructed. 
      There was a nervous expectation in the air. All ponygirl contests were
        entertaining but this one - four laps racing each other around a grassy
        track - was considered the most exciting for the spectators. An informal
        bookmaker was scrawling the latest odds on a blackboard. It seemed that
        every spectator had had a wager. 
      Kate glanced nervously at the other pony traps either side of her. There
        was no laughing or smiling, just an intent concentration by the drivers
        and trepidation on the faces of their reluctant passengers, all tied
        in place like Kate was. 
      A gun fired. 
      Five pairs of ponygirls were off and running, vying for position before
        the first bend of the grassy oval. While the drivers frantically whipped
        and pulled on the reins, their passengers held on for dear life, grateful
        for the rope holding them on the seat. 
      Riccardo was content to let his ponygirls hang back, leaving others
        to fight for the lead. There still were four laps of the 200-meter circuit
        ahead of them. Kate leaned like a pro as they went in and out of each
        bend. 
      Kate admired the rear view of Jessica&#146;s and Debbie&#146;s corseted
        and harnessed bodies as they trotted briskly along, settling into fourth
        position along the back straight. Their long plaited hair with the red
        carnations tied to the ends seemed to be dancing in the breeze. The long
        tails emanating from the ponygirls&#146; asses swished against their
        stockinged thighs. 
      Kate fantasized for a moment about being sandwiched between Jessica
        and Debbie tonight, while they were still in their harnesses. That would
        be very sweet indeed, Kate thought, as she leaned into the next bend. 
      Riccardo, whilst busy with reins and whipper, was a picture of contentment.
        It seemed as if Jessica and Debbie were running for themselves. They
        needed very little encouragement from him; only regular tugs on the left
        reins to steer them round each bend. 
      With little more than a lap to go Riccardo decided it was time to increase
        the pace, if the leaders weren&#146;t to go too far ahead. He wasn&#146;t
        sure how much his ponygirls had left in the tank but they seemed to be
        moving very smoothly. He applied the whipper several times. It worked!
        The sharp stinging on his ponygirls buttocks encouraged Jessica and Debbie
        to speed up, as he knew it would. 
      They drifted to the outside right of Cavallo&#146;s black girls ready
        to overtake. Sadly, Riccardo&#146;s tactics were poor; they would have
        to overtake them on the outside of the bend. If they had any hope of
        catching the leading two, there was no choice. 
      They were almost shoulder-to-shoulder with Cavallo&#146;s ponies when,
        inexplicably, their driver steered them wide. Jessica and Debbie were
        obliged to run wider still, costing them valuable seconds. Eventually,
        running flat out, and having endured whipper at its most severe setting,
        they made it past their obstructive opponents. 
      It was too late - Riccardo could only watch from twenty yards behind
        as Cavallo&#146;s blonde ponygirls fought for the finish with the English
        pony pair. 
      Riccardo had finished a disappointing third out of five, and witnessed
        several Rabbit Island staff throwing their betting slips disconsolately
        to the ground.  
      Kate was furious, tugging angrily on the rope that tied her hands to
        the seat&#146;s back rail, while Riccardo tried to release her. &#147;They
        cheated. The bastards cheated. Riccardo, can&#146;t you lodge a protest
        or something?&#148; 
      He tried to hush her, but was too late to stop Kate&#146;s vociferous
        complaints being repeated to one of the officials. The man glared at
        her, furious that a pussy-girl would have the audacity to speak out in
        such a tone of voice. 
      &#147;Gag her, and take her to the hanging garden.&#148; The exasperated
        official called out to his assistant. 
      Kate continued her futile protest until the handler managed to push
        red rubber ball between her lips. Clipping a leash to her white leather
        pussy-girl collar, he dragged her away from the corral. 
      The Hanging Garden? No! Kate had only just registered what the man had
        said. She stopped walking, causing the chain leash to go taut as she
        dug her heels in. With tears welling in her eyes she shook her head at
        her handler, blubbing at him from behind her ballgag. She didn&#146;t
        was to go to the torture garden, she was the Island&#146;s new nurse,
        and was supposed to be reporting back on duty in the medical suite. Doctor
        Schmidt warned her that he would not tolerate any more misbehavior. Whenever
        she returned to the medical suite, she expected he would punish her again. 
      THE HANGING GARDENS 
      (Kate) 
       
      The colorful sweet-smelling rose garden heralded Kate&#146;s arrival
        into the Hanging Gardens. The overwhelming scent of flora collected from
        all over the tropics assaulted her senses. Rich plant life hung lushly
        from walls and trellis partitions to create a maze-like, and sometimes
        tunnel-like surrounding of red, blue, purple, yellow, green and white:
        Heliconias, orchids, ginger plants and species too numerous to mention. 
      How incongruous were the screams and moans that came from within an
        area of such visual and olfactory splendor! Four other unfortunate women
        were already installed in the Hanging Gardens, not exactly hanging, but
        suspended so that their bound and helpless bodies could be worked on
        for the pleasure of their tormentors. 
      Kate could not see the other women, but she certainly could hear them.
        The dense foliage of the Hanging Gardens provided visual privacy whilst
        ensuring that the cries of its victims were publicly aired. Could it
        be that the tormentors were trying to outdo each other in the pitiful
        noises of their respective victims? Karen, the journalist, was one of
        those pleading for mercy as if her life was in dire peril. 
      The handler soon had Kate strung up, her hands re-tied in front of her,
        but only so they could be hauled upwards and secured far above her head,
        leaving her stretched and having to balance on tip-toes. The stilettos
        of her white high heels were redundant. 
      Kate prayed that she might be permitted to keep her ballgag to stifle
        the shame of her inevitable cries.  
      Two men stood intently watching her from a few yards away. The handler
        turned to them. &#147;Here you are. You&#146;re in luck - you&#146;ve
        got yourselves a pussy-girl at no extra charge. I thought you&#146;d
        like to undress her yourselves. Do you have your signed agreements?&#148; 
      The men held out the papers that governed what they were permitted and
        forbidden to do to their victim. The handler folded and pocketed the
        papers, wishing the men a good time as he departed. 
      Kate was at the mercy of her two tormentors - a middle-aged man and
        another in his twenties. Father and son, she wondered? As if that would
        make any difference! She studied the implements that had been meticulously
        laid out on a table in front of her. Not just the usual nipple clamps,
        flogger and canes that had become a way of life for her but also a selection
        of long needles, a hot brazier, sandpaper, a hammer, violet wands, and
        an electrical unit like a battery charger. It was as if they wanted Kate
        to see all the tools available to them before putting the blindfold on
        her. 
      The younger of the men picked eagerly at the silk laces on the rear
        of Kate&#146;s bodice, while the elder one removed her high heels. Normally,
        Kate enjoyed being undressed by a man, but what should have been a sensuous
        preamble to lovemaking was now a prelude to torture.  
      The laces loosened. The pressure on her breasts eased, then the support
        of the bodice disappeared as Kate felt a soft warm breeze float over
        her nipples. The man&#146;s hands cupped her breasts from behind, squeezing
        their milky fullness slowly&#133;for his pleasure, not hers. &#147;Nice
        tits,&#148; he whispered, as if Kate might appreciate the compliment
        at such a time. 
      Kate&#146;s fingers clawed distractedly at the strands of the taut rope
        that held her body stretched upwards. Her skirt was unclipped and removed,
        leaving only her virgin white stockings and garter belt contrasting so
        well with her nut-brown tanned skin. Her tormentors were very happy for
        Kate to keep those on! 
      &#147;Tie a rope around one of her ankles, Kenny.&#148; The older man
        said.  
      The younger one did so, and made a good job of it - half a dozen neat
        wraps around Kate&#146;s ankle, expertly knotted. 
      &#147;Good. Now pull her foot behind her and thread the end of the rope
        through the ring at the back of her collar. Don&#146;t worry if she protests,
        just pull it as tight as you can.&#148; 
      From behind her ballgag, Kate did protest, and the young man did pull
        it as tight as he could. All her weight was left balancing precariously
        on the toes of one foot while the other was bent painfully back behind
        her, tugging on her collar. 
      While Kate was adjusting herself to the cruel bondage, the elder man
        was wrapping rope around her chest. He soon had rope circling the base
        of each of Kate&#146;s breasts to produce two grapefruit-sized protrusions.
        His hands caressed the taut breast flesh with appreciation. 
      Kate moaned involuntarily at his touch. &#147;You like that, don&#146;t
        you bitch?&#148; He said disdainfully. Getting the younger man to pull
        out her nipples he tied a thin cord tightly around the base of each nipple
        to create hypersensitive tips like small cherries atop each breasts.
        Kate mewled softly as he flicked her bound nipples with his fingernails. 
      He finally removed her ballgag. Kate spluttered and gasped for breath.
        She was a cute-looking woman, they discovered, even without a gag.  
      &#147;Do you see this?&#148; the elder man said, his finger touching
        Kate&#146;s upper lip. &#147;Tight philtral columns and a deep groove.
        See how exquisitely it shapes her lips into an archer&#146;s bow? And
        that retrousse nose... perfect isn&#146;t it? How ironic that if all
        women&#146;s faces looked like this we wouldn&#146;t be able to afford
        to come here!&#148;  
      He traced his finger reverently over Kate lips and nose, delighting
        at how her nostrils flared in response to his touch. 
      The two plastic surgeons resisted the temptation of removing her blindfold
        for another look at her eyes. Kate was trembling, just as they expected
        she would be, but she was just a little aroused too. That was always
        the joy of Rabbit Island girls. Chosen for their submissive tendencies,
        then subjected to further conditioning, they became the exquisite victims
        of men&#146;s desires. 
      &#147;What&#146;s your name, blondie?&#148; 
      &#147;Kate!&#148; She replied nervously but with a measure of defiance. 
      The older man laughed. &#147;You&#146;re English? &#148; 
&#147;Yes. And one day I&#146;ll be back in England and you&#146;ll all be in
jail!&#148;  
      He ran a finger along the side of her labia, as if he knew exactly where
      her rabbit tattoo was. &#147;Don&#146;t count on it, blondie! You&#146;re
      a citizen of Rabbit Island now.&#148; 
       
      &#147;I&#146;m an unwilling prisoner here, not a citizen!&#148; Kate
        yelled. She struggled against her awkward bondage, her toes losing the
        tenuous hold on the ground for a moment. She swung from her bound wrists
        until the man steadied her at the waist so her toes were once more on
        the ground. 
      The older man laughed. &#147;God, I love a girl with a bit of spunk
        in her. Makes it more fun beating it out of her.&#148; 
      The older man took hold of a multi-stranded flogger while Kenny chose
        a light cane. They set to work on Kate&#146;s body, with the intention
        of leaving no part of her body untouched.

    Chapter 10 takes place later on the same day as chapter 9 
    KATE IN THE TORTURE GARDEN 
    Patience is a virtue, they say. Unfortunately for Kate, her tormentors
      had it in abundance. For more than half an hour they studiously applied
      the cane and flogger to her body, savoring every stroke they made and every
      moan she uttered. She was blindfolded and dangling by her tied wrists secured
      high above her. Only the barest touch of toes from one foot on the grass,
      prevented a complete suspension. Kate&#146;s other foot was bent painfully
      back behind her, and tied to the D ring at the back of her thick leather
      collar. The upturned sole offered an inviting target for the cane of the
      man standing behind her. Her white pussy-girl stockings afforded it meager
      protection from the impact of the cane. 
    The two men talked casually as they beat her. Kate learned a new phrase:
      She was a &#145;ten-percenter&#146;. It wasn&#146;t an exact term; just
      the elder man&#146;s theory that she experienced 10% pleasure along with
      her genuine 90% pain. It was an ideal ratio, he explained to his younger
      associate.  
    &#147;One doesn&#146;t want a woman who is too masochistic, too much into
      the pain; but nor do you want a woman that is incapable of being aroused
      by the treatment.&#148; He looked up and down Kate&#146;s squirming body
      with admiration. &#147;This one is perfect.&#148; 
    Perfect! Kate couldn&#146;t help but register the bizarre compliment,
      as he brought the riding crop down on her breasts yet again. How ironic
      that she would receive such a description whilst enduring one of the most
      comprehensive beatings she&#146;d ever known. 
    When the beating finally ceased, everything went quiet except for Kate&#146;s
      panting and puffing out her cheeks. Her body was sweating, tingling and
      marked in red all over. 
    She hadn&#146;t even got her breath back when she heard the static buzz
      of a violet wand.  
    It touched the underside of her rope-encircled breasts, then her cherry-shaped
      nipples, before tracing a tender line down the center of her belly and
      thence to her sex. Kate yelped and moaned, to the great amusement of her
      tormentors. &#147;Oh my god!&#148; she gasped. 
    &#147;That&#146;s a lot more than ten percent!&#148; Kenny declared. &#147;Isn&#146;t
      it, blondie?&#148; 
    The older man slipped the pointed end of the wand between her labia and
      pressed the trigger, in order to elicit Kate&#146;s answer. 
    &#147;Yes...yes...oh god!&#148; She couldn&#146;t even remember what she
      was agreeing with. For a tormented slave-girl who&#146;d forgotten the
      question, &#145;yes&#146; was a safer response than &#145;no&#146;. All
      she knew was that they were playing her like a musical instrument; and
      her cries were augmenting the symphony of pain coming from the other victims
      in the Torture Garden. 
    Kate&#146;s torture paused, more likely so that the men could have a rest
      rather than her. There followed a sound and a smell that Kate knew well.
      Something in Kate&#146;s reaction made the men laugh. 
    &#147;She&#146;s one of us,&#148; Kenny joked. 
    &#147;It&#146;s bad for your health, you know,&#148; the elder man said,
      while carefully placing a lit cigarette between her lips. Kate drew the
      smoke into her lungs, coughing slightly, before savoring the nicotine hit.
      It was her first in nearly a year, since coming to Rabbit Island. 
    The smoke break having concluded, the older man wrapped narrow strips
      of medium-grade sandpaper around each of his index fingers. He pressed
      them against Kate&#146;s bulbous nipples, rubbing gently on the tips with
      a circular motion. Kate&#146;s moans turned to a pleading whimper, as the
      sandpaper felt like it came in direct contact with her nerve-endings. 
    In front of her, the man&#146;s lips mercifully replaced the sandpaper
      on her nipples. Kenny ripped apart the stocking on her foot and did likewise
      to her toes. 
    If only she hadn&#146;t moaned so loud, they might have continued for
      longer. They stopped as soon as her pleasure was apparent. She could have
      kicked herself, and with one leg tied conveniently behind her, she did
      exactly that. 
    There was just one more torture to come. Denial. Kate could hear the men
      tidying up the equipment. Within a minute she felt like a neglected toy,
      dangling sore and exhausted, to await whatever would next befall her. 
    Kate panicked, hearing them about to go. &#147;You&#146;re not going to
      leave me here are you?&#148; 
    &#147;Sure! A handler will untie you sooner or later. You&#146;ll be quite
      safe till then.&#148; 
    &#147;But you haven&#146;t...&#148; 
    &#147;It&#146;s the Torture Garden, blondie. We&#146;re not allowed to.&#148; 
    &#147;But my breasts...my nipples hurt...&#148; 
    &#147;They&#146;ll be fine!&#148; 
    They took a final regretful glance behind them at the perspiring and welted
      body dangling beside them. Her bound breasts heaving with passion, calling
      to them like a siren. The two men headed back to the Lodge, debating whether
      to have a beer before locating their next unwilling slave-girl. 
    FREED FROM HARNESS 
    (Jessica) 
     
    While Kate was experiencing the torture garden, ponygirls Jessica and
      Debbie were taken back to their quarters. 
    Jessica and Debbie obediently stood still, although itching for their
      freedom. Riccardo and Frank busied themselves with unlocking the reins
      and straps that restrained and controlled the ponygirls for so long. 
    &#147;So you really think we have a good chance tomorrow?&#148; Riccardo
      asked Frank, making conversation as they worked. 
    &#147;Sure! It&#146;s the cross-country event! You and these ponies know
      every little turn and hill on this island. You&#146;ll romp home with a
      time good enough to win the whole competition.&#148; 
    Jessica and Debbie were tempted to nod in agreement, but they didn&#146;t
    - their asses had already been whipped enough today. They were pleased to
    learn that Riccardo&#146;s tactical blunder in the track race hadn&#146;t
    cost them any more than the few punishment strokes for their third place.  
    With groans of pain and relief Jessica&#146;s arms were finally released
    from the harness. It was always a bittersweet pain, straightening them after
    so long angled behind her back. 
     
    &#147;That&#146;s enough,&#148; Frank said, having removed the padlocks
      and reins, &#147;the other ponies can do the rest.&#148;  
    With a firm slap on the butts of their respective ponygirls, they sent
      Jessica and Debbie through the door leading to the pony quarters. The men
      left the tack room by the outer door, bolting and locking it behind them. 
    Jessica and Debbie stood in the entrance of the ponygirls&#146; main quarters,
      and called out from behind their bitted mouths. With their arms sheathed
      in the long leather gloves and their hands sealed within them in a fist
      shape, Jessica and Debbie were reliant on their colleagues for undressing.  
    Diana and Melinda soon appeared, their athletic bodies were naked and
      dripping wet having interrupted their dip in their small swimming pool.
      They had also spent the day in harness, but unlike Jessica, had only been
      on taxi duty. Perhaps next year they might be entered in the competition,
      at least that was their hope. 
    First to be removed were the pony boots, mainly because of the ponygirls&#146; self-regulating
      policy forbidding their being worn within the quarters. Diana and Melinda
      bent down to start unlacing them. 
    Diana told Jessica they&#146;d spent most of the day at the corral, harnessed
      to their trap of course. Bruce, their driver, had deliberately made them
      stand facing away from the track. It didn&#146;t stop them from gleaning
      information from the PA system and general conversation around them. It
      was like following the events on the radio, Melinda said. 
    Diana gazed at Jessica with admiration and envy. Even after the exertions
      of the day, she looked pretty in her corset and stockings. The yellow carnations
      were still clipped to Jessica&#146;s nipples and labia.  
    Jessica let Diana undress her just as she did yesterday. Diana was in
      no hurry, lovingly unlacing the corset, collar, leaving the gloves til
      last so that Jessica was her helpless captive for the longest possible
      time. She enjoyed being the recipient of Jessica&#146;s moans of gratitude
      as she removed each item of the costume.  
    Finally naked, except for the embossed marks the tight costume had made
      in her flesh, Jessica followed Debbie into the bathroom, her long pony&#146;s
      tail swishing from her butt hole. Common sense dictated that tails were
      only removed when inside the bathroom. 
    On exiting the bathroom and jumping into the swimming pool, Jessica was
      informed that she would be going to the evening&#146;s festival. The other
      ponygirls were given the task of preparing her. 
    THE CHAIN 
    (Jessica and Master Alex) 
     
    Jessica contemplated the heavy chain that hung in a deep parabolic curve,
      connecting her collar to the side of a wooden chair on her right. 
    Does a chain only bind me if I pull against it, she mused. If it remains
      slack then is it really holding me? What if the chain just signified that
      I belonged to somebody? That wouldn&#146;t be so bad, would it? 
    Jessica shook her head as if trying to purge such crazy thought from her
      mind. She gazed around the Lodge&#146;s ballroom. She was on a slightly
      raised tier that surrounded the dance floor. Chairs and table screeched
      on the parquet floor as they were arranged so that everyone would have
      a good view of the evening&#146;s floor show. She looked up at the double
      height vaulted ceiling, with its massive hardwood beams. All manner of
      equipment, (lighting, speakers, hoists) hung down in the space that functioned
      as dining room, ballroom and theater. There were more than a hundred people
      already there, and space for half as many again. Jessica wasn&#146;t the
      only one kneeling chained to a chair. Not by any means. There were others
      she knew from Rabbit Island, and also female visitors that had earlier
      been mingling freely, enjoying the pony events. Now they had their hands
      tied and were kneeling beside a chair just as she was.  
    The young blonde woman kneeling by the chair alongside her looked familiar
      to Jessica. Then she remembered - it was one of the women who had inspected
      her while she was a pony. The woman was free then, and Jessica could remember
      vividly how the woman&#146;s hands were touching her nipples, admiringly
      caressing their rings, and commenting to her lover (or should that be owner?)
      on how erotic it was. 
    Now this woman was handcuffed, gagged and chained in much the same way
      as Jessica. Despite her predicament, her bright inquisitive eyes darted
      around the hall and she appeared more excited than anxious about what the
      evening&#146;s events would bring. She looked over towards Jessica, as
      if to share the excitement of the event with her. There was no hint that
      she recognized Jessica as the ponygirl she had been so fascinated with
      earlier in the day. 
    A firm hand pressed down on Jessica&#146;s bare shoulder, as if needing
      it for support. Jessica sighed with relief when she saw Master Alex sit
      down wearily in the chair. He studied her for a moment as if trying to
      gauge her mood. She stared back at him, her dark eyes blazing defiantly.
      Their respective looks of benevolent dominance from him, and defiance from
      her, had become a ritual that betrayed the grudging and growing respect
      between them. 
    &#147;Move your knees apart,&#148; he instructed. 
    She made a V shape with her thighs, although it was partially obscured
      by the hem of her dress. 
    &#147;Sit up straight.&#148; 
    Jessica raised her torso to its fullest height and stuck her chest out
      proudly. The arc of heavy chain between her collar and the chair swung
      gently, as Jessica settled in position. 
    &#147;Chin up. Look straight ahead.&#148; 
    Alex began his inspection. Jessica&#146;s wrists were firmly cross-tied
      behind her with what was clearly a long length of rope. She wore a blue
      satin dress with spaghetti straps tied on the shoulders. Unusually her
      breasts, or at least her nipples, were covered. She wore a strapless bra
      that helped form an impressive swell of cleavage. Jessica&#146;s upright
      posture caused it to rise and fall with each breath. 
    Her dark wavy hair cascaded over her shoulders, both at the front and
      back. Jessica had never grown her hair this long before, but she had no
      choice; it was a ponygirl requirement. One of the less onerous ones. 
    Jessica&#146;s makeup was immaculate too. Eyes rimmed with black and shadowed
      in a blue that matched her dress. Her lips, red and shiny, teeth white
      and perfect, made the ball in her mouth seem dull by comparison. 
    Alex reached down with his left hand, pulling up the loose hem of the
      dress, that rested softly at mid-thigh. His palm alighted fully on Jessica&#146;s
      shaven sex, her labia rings tickling his skin. His fingers explored the
      rings, confirming that his instructions had been followed. The labia rings
      were laced together with a ribbon as one might a pair of shoes. 
    &#147;What did I tell you?&#148; Alex said sharply, when he saw Jessica
      looking downwards. She quickly resumed her forward look, staring vaguely
      into the space in front of her. 
    The other ponygirls had done a good job, Alex thought, although Jessica&#146;s
      colleagues had no choice but follow instructions if they didn&#146;t want
      to be punished. That was exactly what they said to Jessica as they thoroughly
      tied her wrists with the rope. (&#145;If you want a slave-girl tied up
      properly get another slave-girl to do it,&#146; was an oft quoted saying
      on Rabbit Island.) 
    &#147;Stay exactly like that,&#148; Alex instructed as he walked off in
      search of someone or something. Jessica did so, maintaining her posture
      and focusing her eyes well beyond the blurred shapes moving in front of
      her. She felt strangely aloof, with a kind of contentment, as if her Master&#146;s
      instruction had somehow liberated her from the status of a captive. 
    A few minutes later Jessica&#146;s meditation was interrupted. Her view
      was blocked by a man and woman standing immediately in front of her. Tight
      leather pants accentuated the woman&#146;s spindly legs. 
    &#147;Is that one of the ponygirls?&#148; The woman asked, with evident
      distaste. Jessica immediately recognized the voice of Madame Cavallo. 
    &#147;That&#146;s right.&#148; Alex replied, thinking further comment
      unnecessary. 
    Cavallo seemed almost distressed by the sight of Jessica. &#147;She should
      be in a stable. It doesn&#146;t seem right to have a ponygirl in here.
      You&#146;re the manager here for God&#146;s sake. You can choose from dozens
      of slavegirls!&#148; 
    Alex laughed. &#147;And tonight I chose this one. Sometimes Madame Cavallo,
      you give the impression you think ponygirls are not human.&#148; 
    Cavallo became irritated. &#147;Of course I know they&#146;re human, but
      the art of ponygirl keeping, is in their transformations - shaping them
      in mind and body. My surgeon is performing wonders with my slave girls.
      Each one becomes more suitable for her purpose. How will this one ever
      complete her pony transformation if you are dragging her off to parties
      every night?&#148; 
    &#147;Ah! That is the fundamental difference between us. On Rabbit Island
      we don&#146;t believe in permanent transformations.&#148; Alex replied. &#147;Firstly,
      there are other adventures to be enjoyed, for the ponygirls and masters
      alike. Secondly, it&#146;s unhealthy. As much as your objective is the
      transformation of your slaves, mine is the preservation of their well-being
      and sanity.&#148; 
    &#147;Each to their own I suppose. Neither of us is in a position to judge
      the other.&#148; Madame Cavallo said, trying for a conciliatory tone. &#147;Not
      everyone on the Rabbit Island committee agrees with you on your lax attitude
      to slaves. Take my advice, Alex. One day they&#146;ll creep behind you
      and stab you in the back.&#148; 
    Cavallo timed her departure perfectly with those fateful words as if she
      had planned for the conversation to end on exactly that note. Alex watched
      cautiously as she strolled off with her empty glass towards other party
      guests. 
    &#147;Ghastly woman,&#148; Alex muttered as he sat down and took a sip
      of white wine. 
    Jessica continued to kneel as motionless as a statue, her back perfectly
      upright, as if a thin wire was stretched between her collar to the ceiling.
      She hadn&#146;t so much as glanced sideways for several minutes. It felt
      like she could hold that pose forever. 
    Alex placed his hand across the shelf of flesh atop Jessica&#146;s breasts,
      surprised at their warmth as he felt their gentle rise and fall. He was
      used to having full access to Jessica&#146;s breasts and her wonderful
      nipples as she wasn&#146;t normally permitted to cover them. Yet the old
      maxim about something being more desirable because it is hidden, came to
      his mind.  
    He lifted up the hem of her dress, as Jessica feared he might. When he
      did that earlier, she was dry. Now she wasn&#146;t. His hand was again
      on her moist sex, molding itself to the curve, finger gently drumming her
      flesh. 
    Jessica sensed with horror that she was virtually pumping her juice onto
      his hand, but he showed no sign of moving it. It was a strange and wonderful
      kind of shame. 
    Alex removed his hand, wiping it with a handkerchief then dabbing Jessica&#146;s
      labia too. She continued to stare ahead at the blurred objects of people
      walking past just a few feet in front of her, glad that she was not required
      to look at the man who engineered that sweet humiliation. She was soon
      wet again. 
    PLACE YOUR BETS 
    Master Alex gave Jessica permission to move. It was like a spell had been
      broken; a force field that protected her from her surroundings had been
      lifted. The Ballroom was much fuller than when Jessica last looked around.
      It was a lively and good-natured atmosphere as there wasn&#146;t yet the
      sound of crying and sniffling slavegirls that usually occured on such evenings. 
    The slave-girl next to Jessica was no longer kneeling at the side of her
      chair. Unnoticed by Jessica, she had shuffled forward. Her shoulder was
      leaning against her master&#146;s thigh, while he played idle with loose
      strands of her hair. Other kneeling slavegirls had also moved to a similar
      state of relative comfort. 
    Jessica started to feel conspicuously different, and if only for her social
      comfort she shifted herself slowly, until she too was leaning against her
      so-called Master&#146;s thigh. She was glad that Master Alex didn&#146;t
      acknowledge her, although he couldn&#146;t have failed to notice her body
      leaning lightly against his thigh. 
    The main lights dimmed. The floor show was about to begin. A loud dance
      beat came over the speaker system. Colored spot-lamps darted madly around
      the hall as the first act of the evening was led in.  
    Eight naked, healthily tanned, bunnies entered the central stage area
      in two regimented lines. Each couple was linked together by a single pair
      of handcuffs on their adjacent wrists. Their eyes looked around the hall,
      nervous of performing in front of such a large number of people, but they
      knew what they were required to do. 
    The handlers, each dressed in a black singlet and long black pants, ushered
      the bunnies into their positions, swishing their riding crops lightly on
      the bunnies, mainly for the amusement of the audience. 
    One of the handlers shepherded the soon-to-be-performing bunnies on to
      four cushioned rubber mats, the type commonly found in a gymnasium. &#147;You
      two - on that mat. You two - next to them. You on that one and you two,
      at the end. Sit down, and stay quiet.&#148; 
    They did as they were told. The handcuffs connecting each couple giving
      the impression that they were simply best friends holding hands. In one
      sense it was an accurate impression - they were good friends, which was
      exactly why they were participating in this event. 
    &#147;Which one is the bottom?&#148; The handler gruffly asked the first
      pair. 
    &#147;Me,&#148; the bunny on the right replied meekly, her eyes cast modestly
      downwards. 
    The handler gripped her right ankle and lifted it high, exposing her openings.
      Another handler was ready with a four inch steel anal prod. Being quite
      narrow, it slipped easily into her. He pressed a button on it. The bunny
      gasped - with surprise more than pain - as a section of the prod expanded
      within her to prevent its removal. There was a long trailing wire on the
      end of the prod. He trailed it along the floor, plugging it into a small
      junction box. 
    Then he bent her right ankle backwards and handcuffed her right wrist
      to it. She sat up awkwardly in her asymmetric bondage, watching as her
      partner was fitted with a dildo gag. A six-inch rubber phallus protruded
      obscenely from the front of her gagged mouth. A wide-eyed look of panic
      passed between pair of them.. 
    The other three pairs received exactly the same anal plugging, bondage
      and gagging. While the handlers taped down the trailing wires and tested
      the control box they routed into, the Master of Ceremonies explained the
      event. 
&#147;Gentlemen and ladies. If you haven&#146;t already done so, you will soon
have the opportunity to place bets on which of these lovely pairs can make the
first orgasm. This year, there will be no cheating now we have a scientific method
of detecting orgasms. Not even the best faker can fool it. We are grateful to
Madame Cervoix for loaning us her anal sensors. These will not only measure spasms,
temperature, and moisture, but will transmit that information in real time to
our projection screen...&#148; 
     
    The large video screen clearly displayed four sets of numbers: 42, 48 ,41
    and 46. It was their respective states of arousal. 100 represented orgasm. 
     
    Jessica knew most of the competitors, and the third pairing she knew very
    well. Sumi and Rachel were her friends from her months at the beach cabin.
    With Sumi on top, Jessica thought they had a good chance of winning. She&#146;d
    experienced Sumi&#146;s seductive skills first-hand. Turning her head to
    look at Master Alex, Jessica saw that his eyes were studying the four naked
    pairs. He was smiling, trying desperately to retain his objectivity when
    faced with such a lustful sight, having difficulty deciding which pair to
    bet on. 
     
    Jessica rested her chin on the linen fabric of his pants. It seemed like
      the correct gesture of her submission to him, and she hoped it would attract
      his attention from the eight naked competitors. She wanted to give him
      a betting tip. 
    Master Alex became aware of wetness on his thigh - the dribbling from
      Jessica&#146;s mouth. He cursed her. 
    Jessica became distressed when she realized her mistake. Blaming it on
      her ballgag simply wouldn&#146;t work. She frantically rubbed her chin
      on his pants hoping somehow it would wipe it away. It didn&#146;t work.
      The damp patch just spread across Alex&#146;s thigh. 
    &#147;For heaven&#146;s sake Jessica. When you&#146;re in a hole, stop
      digging!&#148; Alex finally said. 
    Jessica quietly turned away, ashamed and embarrassed. It wasn&#146;t nice
      to dribble on somebody. With a firm hand on the top of her head Alex turned
      her to face him. Through a series of grunts she managed to communicate
      her recommendation that he bet on Sumi and Rachel. It was only moments
      before the bookmaker&#146;s runner came around. 
    &#147;Five!&#148; said Alex to the runner, &#147;on the third pair.&#148;  
    Jessica relaxed again. Surely he wouldn&#146;t be too mad if she lost
      him five dollars. 
    The runner was one of those people who needed to say aloud whatever he
      wrote. &#147;Master.. Alex.. number.. three..., five... thousand... dollars...
      at... four... to... one. Thank you, Sir!&#148;  
    Jessica let out an exasperated groan. Shit! He had five thousand dollars
      riding on her tip. Suddenly being tied up and chained to Alex&#146;s chair
      didn&#146;t seem such a smart place to be. 
    &#147;How about if we win, I remove the gag and we split the winnings?&#148; Alex
      joked. He didn&#146;t say what would happen if she lost. One of his special
      cane beatings, she supposed. 
    Meanwhile, the eight naked contestants were busily discussing tactics,
      the bottom girl talking to her dildo-wielding partner, explaining how best
      to bring her to orgasm.  
    For Sumi and Rachel, no consultation was necessary. Sumi was already seducing
      Rachel with her dark eyes. She had been sold to Rabbit Island from a Korean
      brothel, and was a true expert in the art of pleasuring men and women alike.
      Rachel, a leggy blonde Texan, formerly a stripper and pole dancer, had
      no fear of performing in public. They made a good team. 
    A bell clanged. 
    The four pairs commenced their very public seductions, amidst cheering
      and encouragements from guests, each rooting for the pair that their respective
      money was riding on. It looked not unlike a high school wrestling meet
      apart from some very obvious differences.  
    Rachel was laying on her back, her right wrist and ankle cuffed together
      at her hip, Sumi lifted Rachel&#146;s left leg up and backwards, cunningly
      using Rachel&#146;s left arm - which was cuffed to her own- to pin it.
      If it were a wrestling match, she would have just won.  
    Sumi pushed the dildo protruding from her gagged mouth into Rachel&#146;s
      mouth. It was like a deep kiss, but it was Rachel&#146;s saliva that Sumi
      was after. Trailing the dildo&#146;s tip down Rachel&#146;s heaving chest,
      it provided an ideal implement for massaging her large breasts, digging
      into each of them in turn, circling the erect nipples, then brushing back
      and forward over them. Meanwhile the fingers of Sumi&#146;s left hand were
      already probing into the blonde&#146;s moist sex. Rachel moaned, hopelessly
      pinned by the lighter but more agile Korean. 
    Jessica watched intently from her position five yards away. She was excited
      in more ways than one, making little bouncing moves in her kneeling position,
      mewling softly, willing her friends along. It they could win this game
      it might save her from a beating and save Master Alex from losing five
      thousand dollars. 
    Making a move that deserved to be seen again in slow motion, Sumi spun
      around on top of her team-mate/victim so the puffy lips of her sex hovered
      inches above Rachel&#146;s mouth. Sumi plunged the dildo into Rachel&#146;s
      upturned sex, bobbing up and down to the accompaniment of Rachel&#146;s
      pre-orgasmic cries. 
    The scoreboard showed Rachel&#146;s orgasm rating hovering stubbornly
      at 99 as if the meter was stuck. The other three pairs were still in the
      low 90&#146;s but gaining fast. With an ear splitting cry of joy, Rachel
      came. Sumi pummeled away diligently until the anal sensors recorded Rachel&#146;s
      orgasm on the scoreboard, just in case anyone in the audience had any doubts. 
    Handlers immediately pulled the other pairs from their various coital
      embraces. There was no second place in this competition. Sumi had her dildo
      gag removed and Rachel&#146;s wrist-to-ankle cuff was removed, as was the
      anal measuring device. They laid side by side like sated lovers, still
      breathing rapidly from the exertions. Perspiring, exhausted, with a mixture
      of triumph and relief. 
    Sumi and Rachel knew there wasn&#146;t a prize for winning, only the avoidance
      of a penalty - and so it was today. The anal probes within the three losing &#145;bottoms&#146; soon
      revealed their other function. The women&#146;s bodies jerked when the
      first shock was delivered. They yelled and cursed and cried as the probes
      delivered a series of shocks, while their gagged partners tried in vain
      to comfort them. 
    Jessica watched the punishments with more amusement than sympathy. She
      had suffered the same punishment in Madame Cervoix&#146;s oral class that
      very morning and knew its effect was dramatic but mercifully short-lived.
      She felt Master Alex unbuckling her ballgag. The sensation of a man&#146;s
      strong hand unbuckling a strap at the back of her head was something that
      Jessica come to enjoy. She opened her mouth as wide as possible to allow
      Alex to pull out the ball. He re-buckled it loosely around her neck like
      a second collar, then wiped her chin with a handkerchief - the same one
      that had earlier wiped away her pussy juice. 
    &#147;What are you going to do with your share of the money?&#148; Master
      Alex asked.  
    Jessica was confused at first, before remembering that Alex had earlier
      joked about splitting the winnings with her. This guy sure could be cruel! 
    Jessica paused for thought, and then announced, &#147;I think I&#146;ll
      go to the travel agency tomorrow and book a flight back to the USA.&#148; 
    Alex laughed a short nervous laugh that acknowledged the wit of her answer. &#147;There&#146;s
      no need. Your flight is already taken care of, but won&#146;t be leaving
      for another year. I&#146;ll stick it in your bank account for you.&#148; 
    Their faltering conversation was interrupted by the man sitting next to
      Alex. He was one of Rabbit Island&#146;s committee members, and someone
      often opposed to Alex when it came to Island policy.  
    Kneeling between the men, Jessica was well positioned to follow their
      conversation. That&#146;s when she learned that Master Alex was leaving
      the island the next morning. It was a trip of great importance to the future
      of Rabbit Island, the men agreed. 
    After that, Master Alex pushed his index fingers into Jessica&#146;s ears,
      as if she were a child not meant to hear an adult conversation. 
    In his capacity as a psychiatrist (and most definitely NOT as a Rabbit
      Island member), his medical contacts had arranged for him to meet the &#145;armless
      woman&#146;, the same one that had motivated Karen Galtz, the nosey reporter,
      to visit the island. She was still in the care of a Bangkok clinic and
      the US consulate. 
    (Jessica closed her eyes, enjoying the sensation of Alex&#146;s fingers
      teasing her ears.) 
    Alex&#146;s task was to discover if and how this woman had lost her memory.
      Was there really a connection with Rabbit Island? If not, then what was
      the significance of her rabbit tattoo? They agreed that Alex would take
      the necessary course of action if he felt the woman could ever implicate
      Rabbit Island in her unfortunate story. &#145;Do whatever it takes!&#146;,
      the man emphasized. Alex nodded. 
    Alex removed his fingers from Jessica&#146;s ears as the conversation
      moved onto less serious matters. 
    &#147;Did you visit the O-Box?&#148; The man enquired. 
    Alex confirmed he had. 
    &#147;Kate, I believe she was called; the newest pussy girl. Nearly blew
      my mind! There&#146;s still waiting list for her.&#148; 
    &#147;I know. She&#146;s a friend of this one,&#148; Alex said, gesturing
      to Jessica, stroking her hair like a dog, which also ensured she couldn&#146;t
      turn around to look at him. &#147;Both graduated Cervoix&#146;s oral course
      with distinction,&#148; he added. 
    Last time Jessica had seen Kate she was being marched to the Torture Garden,
      so it surprised her to discover that she was doing duty in the O-Box so
      soon after. Perhaps had she seen the unsightly red welts covering Kate&#146;s
      body she would agree the O-Box was the only sensible place for her. 
    Jessica had been secretly hoping it would be she giving Master Alex the O-Box
    treatment. To have this man in her power, even while she was tied-up inside
    a box, would be a wonderful feeling. She&#146;d watch as he slipped his cock
    and balls through the cord loop and then his wrists in the loops as the side
    of the box. Then she&#146;d yank the pulley-cord next to her bound hands,
    the one that cause the loops around his balls and his wrists to tighten.
    As her teeth touched his erect cock, would he squirm with fear the way she
    often did with him? Would he struggle helplessly against his bonds, the way
    she often did? And would he finally submit to her and surrender to his pleasure,
    the way she usually did to him? But he was leaving tomorrow. Would she ever
    know? Jessica wondered regretfully. 
     
    A CLOSE SHAVE 
    (Karen) 
     
    The evening&#146;s entertainments continued. A woman was wheeled onto
      the stage, tied belly-down on a small gurney. She was hog-tied - her ankles
      bent fully back and each lashed tight to its respective wrist and upper
      thigh. Her big toes had been bound together and a leather cord tied as
      taut as a bow string between them and a D ring at the top of her head harness. 
    As the trolley spun around to give the audience a better view (it also
      allowed her a full view of the audience) no one could fail to notice her
      bald and shiny head. If her recent close shave were not enough to shame
      her, she also had to endure a nose hook. A two pronged hook that slipped
      into the nostrils with its connected cord tied off tight at the top of
      her head harness, giving the nostrils a distended vertical shape. The pig-like
      expression on the tormented woman&#146;s face caused great amusement. 
    Jessica asked Master Alex who it was. 
    &#147;That&#146;s Karen Galtz, the journalist. The one they picked up
      after Ray was hurt. She&#146;s had a busy day today. Shaved, tattooed,
      branded and pierced. I&#146;m told she&#146;s as horny as hell after all
      that treatment. Looks good, the gag harness on a shaved head, doesn't it?&#148; 
    Jessica didn&#146;t comment, but conceded that there was something about
      the black leather dissecting Karen&#146;s fair skin that was strangely
      compelling. So tightly bound, she was helpless except for the wiggling
      of her fingers, trying in vain to reach the rope knots. The fact that she
      was as &#145;horny as hell&#146; whilst tied that way was something Jessica
      also found strangely compelling. 
    A man held up a pole, perhaps nine feet in length. With the patter of
      a stand-up comedian, he explained to the audience that this was the world&#146;s
      longest dildo. Perfect, not only for the larger woman, but also for fucking
      her when you don&#146;t want to get too close - if she has a cold for example. 
    He moved the pole into a horizontal position and inspected the tip. That
      end really was a dildo, the remaining eight feet length being just a black
      wooden pole. With a theatrical flourish he moved it towards Karen Galtz&#146;s
      rear, into the inviting V shape created by her bent legs. Her pussy lips
      were perfectly aligned and inviting, two soft puffy doors waiting to be
      prized open. 
    Holding the pole at its far end he carefully guided the tip towards the
      spot between Karen&#146;s labia, running it up and down her crack. She
      moaned, surprised by the sudden touch. A microphone had been fixed to the
      gurney just below her chin, so all her moans and whimpers were relayed
      over the P.A. As her keeper moved the pole moved vigorously in and out
      of her, Karen became more and more excited - until she was just a wet throbbing
      pussy on the end of his pole. It wouldn&#146;t have matter if she was in
      the middle of Yankee Stadium by then; there was only one thing she desired,
      and that was to be forced to cum. 
    She might have known it wouldn&#146;t be so simple. Her keeper withdrew
      the pole. 
    &#147;Apparently we are running behind schedule,&#148; the man announced. &#147;We&#146;ll
      need to come back in an hour to finish the little whore off.&#148; 
    Accepting the applause of the audience, he took a bow and pulled the gurney
      (and its frustrated occupant) off the stage. Karen was frantic, her tearful
      protestations at being pulled back from the brink, providing yet another
      amusement for her audience. 
    THE DANCE 
    (Jessica and Master Alex) 
     
    &#147;You need to stretch your legs.&#148; Master Alex said to Jessica. 
    Jessica agreed, although half-dreaded how he intended to do it. Such a
      phrase could mean a couple of hours on the rack was planned for her. He
      reached for the gag strap that had lain loose around her neck. &#147;Open
      wide!&#148; 
    She did so. The familiar red ball filled her mouth. Then she bent her
      head downwards to allow him to buckle the strap. She lifted her chin so
      he could unclip the chain from her collar. With a firm grip under one of
      her armpits Alex helped Jessica to her feet. It was the first time he&#146;d
      seen her standing in that blue dress. He could scarcely believe how nice
      she looked, but tried not to show his admiration too much. Secretly he
      wished her hands were not tied. He would have liked her to take his arm,
      just like a normal couple in a normal ballroom. 
    The lighting softened. Music started playing - Katchachurian&#146;s Masquerade
    Waltz. Its powerful, swirling melody charged the atmosphere with an elegant
    eroticism. Four women, all very elegant in long dresses, danced a choreographed
    routine, spinning, weaving in and out of each other, not hindered in the
    slightest by their hands tied behind them. 
     
    Jessica was shocked. One of the dancers was Debbie - her pony partner. Not
    only could she dance but she could also keep a secret. While Jessica and
    Kate were in Madame Cervoix&#146;s oral skills class during that last three
    mornings, others including Debbie, were rehearsing the dance!  
     
    Master Alex led Jessica quietly to the other side of the ballroom, his
      hand loosely holding her by the rope around her bound wrists. While they
      walked Jessica&#146;s eyes were transfixed on Debbie, looking so graceful
      as she danced. 
    It wasn&#146;t just Debbie&#146;s body that was spinning, so was Jessica&#146;s
      mind. She was walking through the throng of party guests ostensibly as
      Master Alex&#146;s partner. Her hands might have been tied but she was
      undoubtedly his &#145;partner&#146;. He took a glass of wine from a waiter&#146;s
      tray as they squeezed past other guests, most of whom were heading for
      the dance floor. 
    Jessica was disturbed by something. Master Alex had unlocked her chain
      without having to tell her to behave. He had made an assumption that she
      had been &#145;tamed&#146;. What worried her was that he might be correct
      in his assumption. She had no thought of misbehaving. 
    &#147;Master Alex, my old friend, how the devil are you?&#148; A gregarious
      and mature English voice called out. 
    Alex smiled, and headed towards Sir Stanley. &#147;Don&#146;t look them
      in the eyes,&#148; he whispered to Jessica as they approached the Englishman&#146;s
      little group of drinkers. A dark and handsome man named Hector was introduced.
      He was an Argentinean. Master Alex didn&#146;t know the beautiful woman
      at his side but Jessica did...It was Eva, her morning classmate. Hector
      and Eva made a very handsome couple. 
    Eva curtsied politely as Master Alex approached, her eyes cast downward.
      She was wearing an elegant red velvet dress that clung to her shapely figure.
      It had a scooped neckline that left her neck and upper chest bare and showed
      off her attractive cleavage.  
    Hector bade her to turn around, in order to show off the dress. It solved
      the mystery of where her arms had gone. They were squeezed together into
      a single sleeve at the back of the dress. The sleeve ended at the wrists,
      where a sparkling diamant&#233; band fixed them tightly together.  
    Alex was impressed. He&#146;d never seen such an elegant dress with bondage
      as an integral part of its design. 
    &#147;It&#146;s a lovely dress, isn&#146;t it Eva?&#148; Sir Stanley asked,
      having already suggested the answer to her. 
    Eva nodded. She wasn&#146;t expected to speak; her red dress had been
      accessorized by a gag of the same color. The fabric was tight between her
      teeth and knotted at the back of her head. It was the gag of choice for
      smart nights out. 
    Alongside Eva, in the care of Sir Stanley, was a woman wearing a glittering
      silver sheath dress that encased her from neck to toe, leaving her barely
      able to hobble. Master Alex was stunned by her dusky beauty. It was Suchita,
      Jessica&#146;s Indian classmate. Her dress was sleeveless, but that didn&#146;t
      mean her arms were visible. Instead Suchita&#146;s arms were encased within
      the front of the dress, with her hands positioned tantalizingly over her
      sex. Only her thumbs had been tied together, Sir Stanley explained. Like
      Eva, she wore a cleave gag that matched her dress. 
    &#147;I&#146;m thinking of buying this one,&#148; Sir Stanley said, motioning
      towards Suchita. &#147;I don&#146;t usually like darkies, but I&#146;ll
      make an exception in this case. They say she&#146;s educated and well-mannered
      too!&#148; 
    Rabbit Island was known to have some fine looking slaves. Even some of
      the ponygirls were quite attractive. Yet Alex had to admit that a woman
      of Suchita&#146;s beauty was destined for only the finest and richest homes.
      Sir Stanley&#146;s vast estate certainly qualified. He&#146;d explained
      to her that there were already other Indians working on his estate; as
      if that would make Suchita feel better. 
    &#147;So you think your ponygirls have a chance of catching mine tomorrow?&#148; Sir
      Stanley asked Alex, clearly delighted with the showing of his own ponygirl
      in the competition. His tone indicated that he thought the English ponygirls&#146; lead
      was unassailable. 
    &#147;I&#146;m sure they&#146;ll do their best.&#148; Alex replied coolly.
      Jessica detected that Master Alex was not particularly interested in the
      outcome. Nor did he seem about to let on that Jessica was one of those
      Rabbit Island ponygirls. 
    &#147;I had my ponies locked down early tonight, to make sure they&#146;re
      in peak form tomorrow.&#148; Sir Stanley confided. 
    That meant that all the other ponygirl competitors were locked in their
      stables, Jessica realized. She now felt like an interloper at the party,
      with Master Alex as her co-conspirator. She felt a surreptitious pride
      in sharing a secret with him. 
    For five or maybe ten minutes Jessica was in the midst of the most glamorous
      event she had ever known. Alex continued to hold her tightly around the
      waist as he laughed and joked with Sir Stanley, Hector, and any number
      of passers-by. It ended all to soon. Erik came to take her away. But tonight
      there was no doubt in Jessica&#146;s mind that she was being led to Master
      Alex&#146;s bedroom. 
    TIED AND TESTED 
    (Jessica) 
     
    Jessica was standing against a tall bedpost at the foot of Master Alex&#146;s
      four-poster bed - her arms raised and tied with soft white rope high up
      the post. She reached up her bound hands and was amazed to find a knot
      came within her fingertips. It was unlike Erik to be so careless with his
      tying-up, but he&#146;d been drinking, and seemed preoccupied. The rumor
      was that he&#146;d fallen in love. 
    She picked persistently at the knot until it yielded with surprising ease.
    Lowered her hands to her waist, Jessica deliberated for a few moments on
    her next course of action. She reached up and behind her head, unknotted
    the blindfold and unbuckled the gag strap. After pulling out the ballgag
    she unpicked the knots on her wrists with her teeth, and flung the white
    cord to the floor. She was free, but with that freedom came a fear that she
    hadn&#146;t felt in a long time. 
    . 
    Jessica&#146;s heart was racing; pounding in her chest. Adrenaline surged
    through her veins as she realized the enormity of what she had done.She deduced
    from the distant noise that the party was still in full flow and almost yearned
    she was back there. Everybody was busy drinking, dancing and having fun.
    It was the place to be. But if the other handlers were as careless as Erik
    was when he tied her, that made it a good time to mount an escape. 
     
    There was a knife in Master Alex&#146;s bedside drawer. Jessica remembered
      that because he&#146;d used it on her once before - not to cut her, but
      rather to cut the ropes that were binding her too tightly on one occasion.
      She pulled out six inch blade from its embossed leather sheath. The reflected
      light from the blade dazzled her, portending its power, like a miniature
      excalibur. 
    Kicking off her high heels, Jessica went to the bedroom door. She put
      her ear against it and listened. The corridor on the other side seemed
      quiet. Opening the door just a crack, she peeked out. The corridor was
      empty. In one direction lay the main entrance and ballroom, in the other
      was a vast array of other routes, including back to the pony quarters.
      She had always been blindfolded when taken down these corridors. Now her
      memory would be tested. In theory, she could reach the back lawn in less
      than a minute, and from there into the blackness of night. 
    &#147;Right at the bottom...twenty steps... then left... right after thirty
      steps... then left at the end...or was it right?&#148; Jessica rehearsed
      the route in her mind, but everything had gotten confused. &#147;No! It&#146;s
      right at the end!&#148; She said, as if arguing with herself. Having won
      the argument, she opened the door and prepared to run. 
    Whether it was good timing or bad, she didn&#146;t know, but a man, slightly
      the worse for drink staggered into the corridor. It was Vince, one of the
      handlers. He wasn&#146;t a bad man, despite his notorious firmness with
      the beach bunnies. She&#146;d never seen him fight, but he was a big muscular
      guy, who could look after himself. Having had a few drinks wouldn&#146;t
      change that fact. 
    Jessica eyed the six-inch knife in her hand, and considered doing something
      that she&#146;d never before imagined. &#145;Hard up under the ribs and
      turn it, pull it out and do it again&#146;, someone told her once, or perhaps
      she&#146;d just seen it in a movie? 
    She pushed the door closed, but not on the latch, in case it made a noise.
      She prepared herself to deal with him. 
    The door suddenly flung open. Vince had leant on it as he staggered past,
      not expecting it to give way. Confused at suddenly finding himself standing
      in the entrance of the bedroom, he paused. It was very unusual to find
      a room left unlocked. 
    He walked further into the darkened room, stumbling on Jessica&#146;s
      discarded shoes. He heard a noise. &#147;Anyone in here?&#148; 
    There was no answer. 
    &#147;Anyone here?&#148; 
    This time he heard something - a rustling from the bed. As his eyes adjusted
      to the darkness, he saw a moving shape under the duvet. It was a woman.
      Although the duvet covered her body, he could see she was wearing a ballgag. 
    Jessica had her fingers linked together behind her back, and held her
      ankles together whilst pretending to kick out. It gave a good impression
      of being bound hand and foot. She mmpphh&#146;d something. Vince was reassured.
      Everything seemed normal. 
    &#147;Oh, Jessica. It&#146;s you! The door was open. I er...&#148; Vince
      stumbled over his explanation before realizing he had no need to explain
      himself to a ponygirl. He turned and left, closing the door behind him. 
    Jessica pulled the gag from her mouth, but continued to lay in Alex&#146;s
      comfortable bed. She sat up, propping herself with the firm pillows that
      Master Alex favored. Whilst toying with the knife, she accidentally pricked
      her thumb with it. She was surprised at how sharp it was. The first blood
      she tasted was her own, but if she had to, she would kill somebody, Jessica
      told herself. 
    Armed with his valid excuse of an early departure in the morning, Master
      Alex bid a goodnight to his friends in the ballroom and made his way contentedly
      back to his room.

      A DOCTOR&#146;S APPOINTMENT 
      (Alex, Kate, Dr Schmidt) 
       
      Long after Master Alex had left the ballroom he could hear the ongoing
        festivities. More specifically he could hear the squeals of bunnies as
        the whipping demonstration continued. He smiled to himself as he thought
        of their shapely asses on the stage, nervously writhing, but tied down
        and unable to evade the whipmaster&#146;s blows. 
      It was a pity to leave the evening cabaret just as it was reaching its
        peak, but Alex still had to make some preparations for his trip and finish
        off a few administration tasks before his early morning departure from
        the island. 
      Knowing that one of his favored slaves, Jessica, was strung up and waiting
        in his bedroom was a consolation. Just a few measured strikes of a light
        switch on her rear would put him in the mood, and Jessica too, he laughed
        to himself. She was such a confused soul. That&#146;s why he liked her. 
      Before retiring to his room Alex planned to collect something important
        from Dr. Schmidt. He crossed the main courtyard, glad to take in some
        fresh air, though the night-time temperature was still balmy and humid.
        On the way he bumped into Erik who was escorting pussygirl Kate back
        to her new lodgings in the medical suite. She was naked except for a
        white garter belt and tattered white stockings. Her hands were lashed
        together behind her with a thin leather cord. 
      &#147;Good evening, Sir.&#148; Kate called out with chirpy good humor,
        even before Erik had greeted him. Pussy-girls had to be obedient and
        cheerful, and whilst Kate struggled with the former, she had no problem
        with the latter. 
      As Alex was heading to the medical suite, he happily relieved Erik of
        his charge and gestured for the overworked handler to head back to the
        lodge. 
      Noticing Kate&#146;s heavily whip-marked body, he had to admire both
        her body and her spirit. He also noticed thin twine knotted around the
        base of her nipples, with the loose ends dangling a couple of inches
        below them. The marble-sized teats looked very tweakable, Alex thought,
        but were obviously causing Kate pain. He resisted the temptation to pinch
        them. 
      &#147;You&#146;ve had a busy day I believe?&#148; 
      &#147;Yes, Sir. Very busy.&#148; Kate confirmed, maintaining a submissive
        manner. &#147;It started with Cervoix&#146;s oral class then I had a
        few hours on first aid duty. In the afternoon, Sir, I was Master Riccardo&#146;s
        passenger for a pony race. Then I was whipped in the torture garden...
        although that was my own fault I suppose. They bound my breasts and nipples,
        but the cords around the nipples were so tight that nobody could remove
        them. I do hope Dr Schmidt can help me.&#148; 
      They entered the brightly-lit medical suite and found Dr. Schmidt busy
        working at his drug dispensing table. Alex untied the cord binding Kate&#146;s
        wrists. She knelt down in front of the doctor, lovingly kissed each of
        his shiny black shoes, then rose and showed him her nipples. Her down-turned
        lips showing that she felt quite sorry for herself. 
      The doctor gave her a sympathetic look, that almost seemed sincere. &#147;Bring
        me two sodas from the refrigerator,&#148; he said. 
      She promptly retrieved them and offered one to each man. 
      &#147;Hold them hard against your nipples,&#148; the doctor instructed. 
      Kate winced at the sudden coldness on her breasts. 
      &#147;You can have your soda when Kate&#146;s done with them,&#148; he
        joked with Alex as he prepared the forceps and scissors for taking out
        stitches. He beckoned Kate towards him and bent her over the rail at
        the end of a patient&#146;s bed. She complied, still clutching the sodas
        to her increasingly chilled nipples. 
      The men admired Kate&#146;s shapely buttocks, with the puffy lips of
        her sex gaping invitingly between them. The only distraction was the
        numerous welts from her stint in the Torture Garden, combined with the
        still-healing scabs from a week ago, when she shinned down into a ravine
        to rescue Ray the pony driver. 
      The doctor picked out the stitches at the back of her thigh. He smiled,
        still amused and impressed that she had managed to put in the stitches
        herself.  
      &#147;I said to her, she&#146;s a tough cookie!&#148; the doctor recounted
        to Alex. The colloquialism was incongruous with his strong German accent. &#147;Ja,
        a tough cookie!&#148; 
      Kate&#146;s smile remained unseen. A clever cookie too, she thought.
        The handcuff key she&#146;d acquired from Ray&#146;s keyring was now
        safely stitched within her flesh. One day when the time was right, she
        would use it. 
      &#147;Up!&#148; The doctor said, and gestured for Kate to remove the
        sodas from her breasts. 
      &#147;Diet or regular?&#148; Kate asked Alex. He chose the diet held
        to her left breast. She smiled like a kid, knowing the regular cola was
        hers. She knew the doctor never drank soda. 
      It took Dr Schmidt just a few seconds to cut through the twine that
        had been tight around her nipples for the last four hours. She would
        be in some pain as the blood flow started to return, but at least the
        coldness resulting from their contact with the sodas would make it more
        gradual. 
      The men looked over her heavily marked sexy body as Kate walked quickly
        into the bathroom. She started groaning softly as the feeling slowly
        and painfully returned to her nipples. As usual she left the bathroom
        door wide open while she toileted and showered. 
      The men hadn&#146;t even begun to discuss Alex&#146;s upcoming mission,
        when Kate emerged showered and dried; the scent of her soap-cleansed
        body invading their nostrils. 
      &#147;Lay down here.&#148; Dr Schmidt instructed, patting gently on
        a patient&#146;s bed with the palm of his hand. Kate laid on her back
        and stretched her hands to the top of the bed, where leather cuffs were
        fixed and waiting. The doctor buckled them around her willing wrists,
        then did likewise to her ankles at the foot of the bed. 
      &#147;Sore?&#148; The doctor asked. 
      &#147;Hurts like crazy. More than earlier.&#148; Kate replied. 
      &#147;Silly girl. You should have taken a cold shower. I thought you
        knew that!&#148; The doctor poured some cream on his hands and started
        to rub it slowly, but firmly, into Kate&#146;s breasts. She closed her
        eyes and moaned with pleasure at the hands moved expertly across her
        body. 
      While the doctor continued to sooth the skin of his wayward nurse, Alex
        examined the items the doctor had been preparing for him. He picked up
        a small glass tube. 
      &#147;That vial should be put in her first drink.&#148; The doctor commented,
        looking up at Alex only briefly. &#147;Make sure she drinks it as soon
        as she arrives. It&#146;s like a truth drug.&#148; 
      &#147;You mean sodium pentathol?&#148; 
      The doctor scoffed. &#147;Master Alex, we&#146;ve come a long way since
        those days. Your patient will not feel drowsiness. In fact, it will be
        the opposite. She will converse as if you are an old and trusted friend.
        I&#146;ve blended the liquid with dideuterium oxide so it stays at the
        bottom of the glass. Don&#146;t stir it.&#148; 
      &#147;Bottom of the glass?&#148; 
      &#147;She will use a straw, ja?&#148; 
      Alex gave a wry smile as he thought of the armless woman he was due
        to meet. &#147;Yes, I suppose she will.&#148; He was impressed, but not
        surprised, by Dr. Schmidt&#146;s forethought. 
      &#147;If you ask the right questions, this will confirm that she is
        amnesiac. The second vial will help you to unlock her mind - to discover
        if her amnesia is post-traumatic or retrograde.&#148; 
      &#147;In another glass of water?&#148; 
      &#147;Yes. After the first drink, your patient will develop a big thirst.
        She&#146;ll gladly accept your offer of another drink.&#148; 
      The doctor helped Kate to turn over onto her belly so he could soothe
        the marks on her back. She ground her belly into the bed as the doctor&#146;s
        hand slipped between her thighs. As his fingers worked themselves into
        her moist opening, Kate&#146;s thighs closed on his hand. Shamelessly,
        she began to hump his hand while the doctor continued his conversation
        with Alex. 
      &#147;Little slut!&#148; The doctor joked, but made no attempt to move
        his hand. 
      &#147;Do you think it will work? Can it accomplish what the clinic has
        failed to do?&#148; Master Alex probed. 
      The doctor smiled confidently. &#147;I&#146;m almost certain. It performed
        very well as an antidote to Retramnesiol in recent trials and may perform
        equally well with non-chemical amnesia. My colleagues in Dresden eagerly
        await your report.&#148; 
      &#147;Oh yes. Retramnesiol! I haven&#146;t heard about it for a long
        time. How is it progressing?&#148; 
      &#147;Very well indeed, Master Alex. We lost valuable research time
        when a senior technician disappeared last year, but now we are back on
        track. Next year, if all goes to plan, Rabbit Island will have a powerful
        tool at its disposal. We can erase the memory of a subject to such an
        accurate degree that we are able to choose whether she remembers graduating
        from high school or college.&#148; 
      The doctor unbuckled the cuffs from Kate&#146;s wrists and ankles. Without
        further prompting she climbed off the bed and walked drowsily to a three-foot
        high steel post stood on the other side of the room. Trailing from the
        base of the post were two chains, each with a set of handcuffs at the
        end. Kate attached one set around her ankles, then placing her hands
        behind her back, clicked the other pair around her wrists. 
      Alex enjoyed watching Kate&#146;s little self-bondage scene but was
        bemused by her expression, which was a mixture of shame and frustration.
        The doctor tossed a pillow to her, which she gripped between her teeth
        and moved it a position to rest her head on. 
      Master Alex gazed at Kate&#146;s curvy body as it yielded happily to
        the doctor&#146;s touch. &#147;And they&#146;ll have no memory of Rabbit
        Island. It will remain an empty gap in their lives?&#148; 
      &#147;Exactly! They won&#146;t remember a thing about it. No traumas.
        No flashbacks. They simply get on with the rest of their lives.&#148; Kate
        realized the men were talking about her... and Jessica... and the other
        bunnies on Rabbit Island. 
      Master Alex was cheered by the news. The ability to release their captives
        after several years was a long-held ambition of his. He looked at Kate,
        a young woman in her prime, and a credit to the Rabbit Island selection
        process. But where would she be in ten years? A burnt out, drug hazed
        whore at best, more likely she would be dead. 
      Retramnesiol changed everything. If the drug is successful Kate could
        one day be released from slavery and eventually become just like any
        other happy wife and mother, with a mysterious gap in her life. Meanwhile
        Rabbit Island would continue to thrive, replenished with fresh meat. 
      It wasn&#146;t a case of conscience in seeking to improve the fate of
        his slaves, it was simply that Master Alex loved playing God. 
      &#147;And the third vial. What&#146;s that for?&#148; Alex asked, keen
        to conclude matters and return to his room where a body every bit as
        good as Kate&#146;s awaited him. 
      &#147;If you use the antidote vial, there is a chance the armless girl
        may remember much more that anyone expects. It is possible that her knowledge
        could incriminate somebody in our organization. If there is any chance
        of this, you must use the third vial.&#148; The doctor paused and looked
        intently into Alex&#146;s eyes to ensure he understood. Alex nodded solemnly. 
      &#147;She will show no symptoms for at least twelve hours. Then, soon
        after the symptoms occur, she will suffer a massive heart failure.&#148; 
      &#147;I&#146;ll take care of it.&#148; Alex acknowledged as Dr Schmidt
        handed him the vinyl case that carried truth, memory, and death. 
      As an afterthought, just as he was walking out the door, Alex asked
        the doctor for a sedative &#145;to help an athlete get a good night&#146;s
        sleep&#146;. The doctor promptly obliged. 
      IN THE BEDROOM 
      (Alex and Jessica) 
       
      Viewing Kate&#146;s naked body had piqued Alex&#146;s libido and had
        him hurrying back to his bedroom. Unzipping Jessica&#146;s firm ponygirl
        body from her tight blue dress was uppermost on his mind. He had a hunch
        that Jessica, bound and prepared by Erik to his usual specification,
        might feel the same way too. 
      He opened the door to his room, glad as always to enter his private
        sanctuary. Jessica was standing there to greet him, her arms raised. 
      Alex inspected her. She seemed nervous, almost breathless, as he inspected
        the ropes around her wrists. They were secured to the top of the tall
        bedpost as he expected, but Erik&#146;s rope work was surprisingly poor.
        Jessica&#146;s fingers played distractedly with the knots that bound
        her. If she wasn&#146;t blindfolded, Alex thought, she would realize
        how easily she could escape. 
      His body pressed against Jessica&#146;s as he reached upwards, tightening
        the ropes on her wrists and pulling out the slack so she was stretched
        fully upright. He offered a glass of water to her lips. She gladly took
        a few gulps. 
      &#147;That&#146;s better, isn&#146;t it?&#148; He said, expecting somehow
        that she should be comforted by being bound even tighter. Jessica nodded. 
      She could hear Master Alex rummaging around the room; packing his suitcase
        for the morning&#146;s departure. Her mind was reeling. Ten minutes earlier,
        she was sobbing in his bed with a large knife in her hands. If she was
        going to escape she would have to kill him. For a moment she even pressed
        the knife to her own belly, thinking of how her bloodied corpse in Master
        Alex&#146;s bed could be revenge for all his torments. She did neither. 
      Was it cowardice that made her return to the bedpost and re-tie her
        wrists just as Erik had left her? At that moment, tugging on the ropes
        that Master Alex had just made secure, Jessica felt pathetic and ashamed.
        She had just proved that she was only fit to be a slave and a ponygirl.
        She didn&#146;t deserve to be free. 
      Without warning she felt Master Alex&#146;s hands running teasingly
        over her body. He spun her around so her front was pressed against the
        bedpost. As sexy as her body might have looked in that tight dress, Alex
        still couldn&#146;t wait to get it off her. He slowly pulled the zip
        down her back, revealing her flesh like a succulent fruit. 
      When the dress fell, laying pooled around her ankles, Jessica was left
        in a sheer black basque to which was attached the garters of her stockings.
        Alex continued to undress his bound prey until she stood naked except
        for the sturdy leather collar about her neck. A collar goes best with
        nakedness, and this one suited her well. 
      With his hands placed on Jessica&#146;s hips he spun her around to face
        him again. He kissed her forcefully on the lips, but the real object
        of his desire was lower down. 
      When his hand found Jessica&#146;s laced-up labia rings, Alex couldn&#146;t
        figure out who&#146;s desire was the greater. A red ribbon criss-crossed
        through the eight rings in Jessica&#146;s labia, effectively barring
        the entrance. Jessica squirmed in anticipation shifting her weight from
        one foot to another. Alex knelt down to undo the bow and remove the ribbon
        from Jessica&#146;s moistening sex. He was mildly surprised that the
        ribbon did not pull free. Straining his eyes in the dimly lit room he
        realised that the ribbon was tightly knotted at each ring. &#147;Somebody&#146;s
        idea of joke&#148;, he muttered, before getting off his knees to retrieve
        his knife from the bedside drawer. 
      Jessica swallowed hard when she heard the drawer slam closed. &#147;What
        the fuck did I do with that knife?&#148; Alex asked himself, more mystified
        than angry. Jessica felt his hands on her hips again, and again he prompted
        her to turn around so her back was to him, and her belly hard against
        the post once more. 
      She heard the whoosh of the cane an instant before it came hard down
        on her buttocks. Five more blows followed in rapid succession. In her
        mind her cowardice deserved it. She very nearly almost begged Master
        Alex to hit her harder to obliterate her pervading sense of defeat. 
      Sometimes a spanking or caning was what passed as foreplay for Alex,
        and despite herself, Jessica too found she could become aroused by such
        treatment... especially at the hands of this man. 
      Alex had already decided his next move. He located a tube of lubricant
        and began to apply it. Jessica soon felt its coolness rubbing against
        her anus. It wasn&#146;t at all what she had in mind. Being butt-plugged
        as a ponygirl was one thing, but being fucked in the ass was quite another,
        but Master Alex&#146;s desire for her was not to be denied. She felt
        his body pressing urgently against hers. 
      &#147;The knife...is in the bed...Master,&#148; Jessica stuttered; grateful
        that her blindfold prevented Master Alex from looking into her eyes. 
      The momentary bulge in Jessica&#146;s neck as she swallowed confirmed
        to Master Alex that it wasn&#146;t a joke. He retrieved his knife which
        was nestled within the bedsheets as the bound slave had suggested. The
        room went deathly quiet for the next minute. 
      The next sensation Jessica felt was the cold blade of that knife trailing
      across the bottom crease of her breasts. Then she felt it grazing her nipples
      clanging gently with the nipple rings. She held her breath, worried that
      any sudden movement might cause the blade to slip and cut her. The pointed
      end 
      of the blade snaked slowly down to her belly button, then upwards to her
      pounding heart. It seemed to Jessica as if it was piercing her. That was
      typical of Master Alex, trying to scare her like that. She knew how much
      he loved to trick her, yet from behind her blindfold she could almost imagine
      a rivulet of blood emanating from below her left breast. 
       
      Alex took a step back and inspected the cuts he had made. With her wrists
        tied together high above her Jessica swayed unsteadily on her high heels,
        lost in her own thoughts, unaware of exactly what he had just done. 
      In Master Alex&#146;s opinion there is nothing that shows off a woman&#146;s
        lips better than a blindfold. Only when her eyes are covered can the
        lips be appreciated in all their sensuous beauty. Alex licked up the
        thin trail of blood on Jessica&#146;s torso and kissed her. 
      Jessica gasped as she realized she was tasting her own blood mingled
        with Master Alex&#146;s passionate kiss. She didn&#146;t resist. She
        was still savouring the taste of the kiss when she felt the knife cutting
        through the ribbon which closed up her sex. Four delicate cuts later
        she felt a strange kind of freedom. Her hips swayed in anticipation. 
      Master Alex loosened his pants and let them fall to his feet. With Jessica
        blindfolded, his ungainly stance didn&#146;t seem to matter. He soon
        had his straight and straining cock buried within her moist opening,
        his naked loins pressed firmly against hers. He pushed upwards, lifting
        her slightly. 
      &#147;Why didn&#146;t you kill me while you had the chance?&#148; He
        asked with a slight grunt as he thrust again. 
      &#147;Why didn&#146;t... you kill me?&#148; Jessica grunted back, avoiding
        the question she didn&#146;t want to answer. 
      &#147;Too val... uable.&#148; Master Alex said, thrusting upwards as
        he said it. &#147;Best... ponygirl... we&#146;ve... got.&#148; (It wasn&#146;t
        true, but Jessica was flattered, despite herself.) 
      They didn&#146;t usually talk when he fucked her as Jessica was invariably
        gagged. &#147;You&#146;re... going... tomorrow?&#148; She managed to
        ask before groaning with evident pleasure as he thrust into her again. 
      &#147;Early morning.&#148; 
      &#147;How long... oohh!.. how long for?&#148; Jessica was struggling
        to hold up her end of the conversation. Alex was deliberately pushing
        whenever she started to speak. 
      &#147;A week... maybe more.&#148; 
      Jessica did something she&#146;d never done before. She lifted her legs
        and wrapped her ankles around the back of Alex&#146;s thighs. It was,
        she knew, a kind of embrace. 
      &#147;The armless... woman?&#148; 
      &#147;Yep... Something strange about her... I gotta find out.&#148; 
      With her hands tied together Jessica&#146;s mind was flooded with all
        kinds of bizarre images - of being a harnessed ponygirl without arms,
        of Master Alex making love to her without needing to tie her hands...
        because she no longer had them. 
      She hated herself for climaxing with such an image in her mind, yet
        the power of the orgasm was so much greater than normal, almost painful.
        As was Alex&#146;s, she thought. 
      Alex left Jessica dangling like a rag doll as he went to the bathroom.
        His ropes wrapped tightly around her wrists and tied off high up the
        bedpost were all that kept her from slumping to the floor. 
      He returned shortly afterwards, wiping her chest with a wet flannel,
        removing all traces of the blood. He applied a sticking plaster to the
        small capital A shape he had cut into her flesh with the knife. 
      Soon after, Jessica&#146;s wrists and ankles were in leather cuffs that
        connected her to each end of Alex&#146;s bed. She was drowsy and barely
        remembered him getting into the bed beside her. &#145;He&#146;s drugged
        me again&#146;, she thought, just before sleep took her. 
      Jessica awoke with sunlight flooding in through the large window. She
        had slept like a log and felt rested and ready for the day. It was the
        final day of the ponygirl competition, the cross country event. She was
        looking forward to it. 
      She pulled against the bonds, even though they weren&#146;t tight. It
        was just a way to stretch her muscles, and felt good. It didn&#146;t
        matter that the leather cuffs prevented her hands from reaching her breasts
        or genitals, because she, or rather, her body belonged to somebody else.
        Someone that knew how to give her pleasure whilst taking his. Perhaps
        he would take his pleasure with her again this morning before their respective
        days started? She turned over, away from the window and expectantly towards
        her sleeping companion. She sighed with disappointment. 
      Master Alex&#146;s day had started much earlier. He&#146;d already gone.

      PONYGIRL EVENT No. 5: CROSS COUNTRY 
      (Jessica, Kate, Riccardo) 
       
      At the starting line, the official timekeeper counted down for the first
        pony pair. Six miles of winding and hilly trails lay ahead of them. The
        narrow trails were not suitable for racing, so this event was a time-trial
        with ponygirls setting off at five-minute intervals. 
      Jessica and Debbie waited calmly for their turn, the second-to-last
        to go. When Jessica was being rigged up in her harness she slipped into
        what she half-jokingly called her &#145;pony brain&#146;. It was a simple
        empty-headed state of mind that helped her get through the day. In her
        pony brain she found it easier to accept the straps and reins that they
        forced upon her. Spending the day with a bit between her teeth, reins
        clipped to her nipple and labia rings, and a butt-tail locked into her
        rectum was just part and parcel of the job. A normal woman would find
        such things painful and degrading, but a fully trained ponygirl could
        take such things in her high stepping stride. 
      The ponygirl&#146;s all-controlling bondage made her an exotic, beautiful
        and environmentally friendly means of transport, appealing to the artistic
        and sporting sensibilities of their masters. Some people assumed that
        ponygirls were rather dumb, as animals and women. Jessica knew different.
        It required concentration and intelligence as much as physical effort
        if they were to perform to their driver&#146;s satisfaction and minimize
        their end-of-day punishments. 
      They needed a high degree of alertness, responding crisply to every
        stroke of the fiendishly effective electric whipper device. Unlike a
        manhandled whip this one never missed its target and always delivered
        the exact strength the driver selected. 
      Sometimes, when out running, in perfectly synchronized stride with Debbie
        beside her, Jessica had to admit it felt good. And when their driver
        pushed them down the long sections and they stretched to full stride,
        their pacing seemed to eat up the ground ahead of them. Even the whipper
        striking her buttocks could feel oddly stimulating on those occasions. 
      A driver and his ponygirls in perfect harmony; that was the objective.
        Earning the approval of their driver and avoiding his punishments was
        all that mattered to ponygirls. 
      Today Jessica had trouble clearing her mind. She often felt a certain
        anxiety when Master Alex was not present on the island. Although he&#146;d
        never mentioned it, Jessica learned from elsewhere that he had twice
        intervened to prevent her being shipped from the island. &#145;Being
        shipped&#146; was the great fear. Received wisdom for bunnies and ponygirls
        was that anywhere you were shipped would be far worse than Rabbit Island. 
      Another pony trap was approaching the start area. Jessica could easily
        identify them by the sound of their rhythmic stride picked out on the
        gravel path. Her harnessing and blinkers meant she could only see that
        which was directly in from of her, so she waited for them to come into
        her limited view. It was Cavallo&#146;s blonde pair, just as she thought.
        Their long blonde hair was caught by the breeze and flowing behind them,
        not from their heads but from their butt-tails. The tail hair swished
        against the back of their high-stepping thighs as they trotted past. 
      They wore zebra costumes, a dramatic change from the shiny black fabric
        of yesterday. The skintight black and white patterned lycra showed off
        every athletic curve in their slim bodies. Collars, two-inches wide,
        of black patent leather were tight around their necks, purely for decoration.
        Their leather harnessing was lighter than Jessica&#146;s and Debbie&#146;s,
        more attractive perhaps, but less suited to the twists and turns of the
        Rabbit Island pathways, in Jessica&#146;s opinion. 
      Debbie made a coughing noise which sounded not much like a pony or a
        girl. Jessica echoed it in agreement. Harnessed side by side yet unable
        to see or speak to each other, they had developed a repertoire of noises
        by which they communicated. This sound indicated their amusement at the
        zebrafied ponygirls. At such a time as this, with rewards and punishments
        at stake, they found it difficult to think of the zebra girls as fellow
        slaves. They were competitors. 
      &#147;Go!&#148; The starter shouted. 
      The driver of the zebra girls lashed out with his whip, connecting sweetly
        with their bare buttocks. They trotted down the track at full pelt as
        if their lives depended on it. Alongside the zebra girls&#146; driver
        on the narrow bench seat was Lucy with her hands lashed behind her to
        the backrest. She looked back over her shoulder, terror etched on her
        face, knowing how treacherous the island&#146;s precipitous trails could
        be. Jessica and Debbie watched them disappearing into the distance, itching
        to get moving themselves, as were Riccardo and Kate, sitting on the trap
        behind them. 
      The starter approached Jessica and Debbie, grabbed the reins where they
        were attached to their nipple rings and led them to the start line. He
        explained the starting procedure to Riccardo. 
      While they waited for a starting signal, the island&#146;s official
        photographer stepped in front of them. He took some photos with a digital
        camera; images destined for the computers of Rabbit Island associate
        members around the world. In recent times - since Jessica's arrival -
        these photographs were also turning up taped to a wall within the pony
        quarters. Jessica and the other ponygirls had acquired a curious obsession
        with their own pony images. When an envelope of photos was slipped into
        the ponygirl quarters, the pictures would engross the off-duty ponygirls
        for many hours, complementing each other on their physiques and pony
        poses. Little did they know that the Rabbit Island management was quietly
        encouraging their vanity in delivering the photos. It was yet another
        devious ploy from Master Alex. 
      The photographer departed but Jessica and Debbie continued to wait for
        a signal, though by then they were losing all hope of catching the zebra
        girls. 
      &#147;Go!&#148; The starter shouted. 
      Ponygirls Jessica and Debbie stood perfectly still and barely flinched.
        They had made the point that they took their commands from Riccardo not
        the starter. 
      Then they both felt a sharp sting of the electric whipper on their buttocks.
        In an instant they were trotting at a steady pace along the trail, with
        the polite applause and shouts of encouragement fading quickly into the
        distance behind them. Riccardo held back on the whipper, content to keep
        a steady pace in the early part of the race. 
      Alongside Riccardo sat pussygirl Kate. Despite her outbursts yesterday
        earning her a session in the Torture Garden, she was once again allocated
        as his unwilling passenger; although if the officials had known how much
        she enjoyed these rides, they would never have allowed her. 
      Kate was squeezed onto the narrow bench seat alongside Riccardo, her
        right hip pressed and grinding against his left. Having her hands tied
        and lashed firmly to the backrest gave her a feeling of safety - it prevented
        her from falling off on a tight bend. She was revelling in the rear view
        of her best friend Jessica, corseted, butt-plugged, tightly harnessed
        and trotting so beautifully. Kate was slightly ashamed that she harboured
        a lustful fantasy of making love to Jessica while she was wearing all
        her pony gear. Yet she knew it would remain a fantasy. Not even the men
        were permitted to fuck the ponies; at least not when they were in harness. 
      Jessica and Debbie were running very well; hoofs striking the ground
        in perfect synchronization, maintaining good posture, and responsive
        to Riccardo's commands. They felt good, in spite of their exertions.
        This was, after all, what their training and conditioning had prepared
        them for. 
      They were about halfway round the course when the zebra girls were spotted
        a few hundred yards ahead. Their driver was desperately lashing out at
        them, pushing the poor zebra girls to the limit, but it would never be
        enough to stop Riccardo&#146;s team from reaching them. 
      It turned out the driver had pushed them beyond their limit, rounding
        a corner far too fast. Pussygirl Lucy screamed as she felt her side of
        the trap rise upwards as the wheel left the ground. As it toppled onto
        its side it took the zebra girls with it, flipping them into the air.
        The whole trap and its occupants crashed down on a rocky area alongside
        the gravel track. 
      The upended left wheel of the trap was still spinning slowly when Riccardo
        and his team reached them. If not quite a scene of carnage it was certainly
        one of anger, pain and frustration. Pussygirl Lucy&#146;s landing had
        been cushioned by the driver, and her weight now pinned him to the ground.
        Tied as she was, she couldn&#146;t lift herself off him, despite his
        urgent cries for her to do so. His right leg was sandwiched between the
        ground and the mangled wooden trap. 
      Jessica and Debbie continued past, ignoring Riccardo&#146;s signal to
        stop until a urgent and painful tug on their nipple reins compelled them
        to. They carefully turned around and headed back to the crash site. 
      Riccardo leapt down to assist. The pony trap had also become driver
        trap. He looked at the groaning foursome, all laying on their sides in
        various states of distress. 
      &#147;Untie me! I can help!&#148; Kate yelled, bouncing up and down
        in her seat. Riccardo saw that Kate&#146;s medical skills were needed. 
      The whimpering zebra-costumed girls were the priority. It was sickeningly
        obvious that the one underneath had a broken ankle. Riccardo managed
        to unbuckle the straps attaching the first zebra to the trap. He was
        having difficulty removing the steel bit from her mouth. 
      Eventually he saw the problem - a wing-nut in the center of the bit
        inside her mouth. He turned it, then spun it until it came off its thread. 
      Kate winced at the sight. &#147;Eughh! It&#146;s locked into her mouth!&#148; 
      She was right. Riccardo saw the metalwork inside the girl&#146;s mouth.
        A bar was bonded behind her lower back teeth while the vertical part
        of the T shaped device was skewered down and up through her tongue, ending
        in the screw-threading used to hold the bit in place. 
      &#147;So that&#146;s what they call the tongue bit!&#148; Riccardo was
        appalled and yet fascinated. At one point Rabbit Island had considered
        fitting these to their ponygirls. It was said to give the driver better
        control of the ponygirl&#146;s head. The proposal had been rejected on
        grounds of excessive cruelty. 
      Riccardo and Kate helped the first trembling zebra girl to her feet.
        Her arms were still locked behind her in a stylish cuff and harness.
        Kate dusted down the slim girl&#146;s figure-hugging costume. It covered
        her from head to toe, except the lower part of her face, her buttocks
        and the cut-out openings for her nipples and labia. Her nipples were
        ringed and used for attaching reins, just like Jessica and Debbie. Her
        labia, neat, puffy and red with lip-gloss, were exposed for public show,
        and of course for her humiliation. A small padlock with its U passing
        through each labia lip ensured that her sex would not be breached, certainly
        not by a penis. 
      &#147;Are you okay?&#148; Kate asked her. 
      &#147;Yehhhh!&#148; replied the ponygirl, with a speech defect caused
        by her tongue bit. Even through the small eye holes of the girl&#146;s
        skintight hood, Kate detected that she was agitated by seeing her partner
        laying down in obvious pain. 
      While Kate and Riccardo attended to her injured partner, the girl stood
        in front of Jessica - it felt natural to herd with other ponygirls. Jessica
        cursed the rubber bit in her mouth, she would have liked to talk to this
        ponygirl. (In fact she could have made some intelligible sounds but it
        had been a long time since she had attempted it.) The ponygirl turned
        slowly in a circle, trying to take in her surroundings through her small
        eye holes. Then, without warning, she bolted. 
      Debbie made a curious grunt as if to say &#145;Now there&#146;s something
        you don&#146;t see every day&#146;. Jessica agreed. They watched the
        bizarre sight of the zebra girl holding surprisingly good trotting form
        as she disappeared down the trail in the direction of the bunnies&#146; beach
        cabin. 
      &#147;Oh for fuck&#146;s sake!&#148; Riccardo said as he looked up.
        There was no way the girl could be caught. Kate didn&#146;t care. She
        was busy nursing, concerned only with the injuries to the other ponygirl
        and her driver. 
      Riccardo heard another pony pair approaching. They were Madame Cavallo&#146;s
        other ponies - her elegant black girls. He blinked in utter disbelief
        as they trotted past, slowing down for a fraction, then speeding up.
        The sudden ferocity of their driver&#146;s whipping had a lot to do with
        that. He&#146;d seen that the competition title was his for the taking. 
      SOME EXPLAINING TO DO 
      At least the driver of Cavallo&#146;s black girls had the decency to
        tell the officials at the finish line about the accident. Fifteen minutes
        later the crash site was descended on as various people arrived, transported
        of course by Rabbit Island&#146;s ponygirls. 
      Diana and Melinda pulled up alongside Jessica. Though slightly out of
        her blinkered field of vision she knew it was them just by the sound
        of their boot bells. Sandra and Cathy were not far behind. Bruce and
        Frank, their respective drivers, came to Riccardo&#146;s aid helping
        to lift the pony trap from the injured man. 
      Voices were raised, astonished and angry to learn of the assisted escape
        of one of Cavallo&#146;s ponygirls. Kate kept her head down and busied
        herself with her nursing duties, leaving Riccardo to handle the awkward
        questions. 
      When Dr Schmidt arrived, Kate was relegated to pussygirl again. It surprised
        her that she was considered more to blame for the ponygirl&#146;s escape
        than Riccardo, and worse was to follow. 
      They loaded the casualties onto the ponygirls&#146; trailers but there
        wasn&#146;t space to take pussygirls Kate and Lucy back to The Lodge.
        Their offer to run behind the trailers was rejected with a laugh. Pussygirls
        might be blonde and willing, but they weren&#146;t athletes. They would
        have to wait until somebody came back for them, Frank said. He already
        held long lengths of rope in his hand, which would help the pussygirls
        with their waiting. 
      Kate and Lucy were dressed in their normal pussygirl attire of long
        white corset dresses, although the white linen was badly soiled by recent
        events. 
      &#147;Strip!&#148; Frank commanded with a leering smile on his face. 
      Kate and Lucy unlaced the back of each other&#146;s dresses, aware that
        all eyes were on them. Frank seemed determined to put on a show for the
        half a dozen visitors. 
      &#147;Everything!&#148; Frank said sharply, as the two pussygirls stood
        hopefully in their white basques, stockings and heels. They obeyed instantly.
        Pussygirls always obey - that was Rule 1 in the Pussygirl&#146;s Code. 
      Frank, one of the island&#146;s best rope masters, soon had each of
        them standing tightly tied at elbows, wrists, knees and ankles. They
        wobbled like two nervous poles, knowing that the gravel would provide
        a rough landing should they topple over. 
      Bruce held up two vibrators he kept in his toolkit.  
      &#147;Something to keep them amused while they wait? I&#146;ll take
        care of Lucy.&#148; 
      Frank held the vibrator up to Kate. &#147;Lick!&#148; 
      She did better than that, putting her mouth onto it, swallowing up four
        inches. Her eyes making suggestive contact with Frank as she did so.
        A little flirting wouldn&#146;t do any harm, she figured. 
      &#147;Slut!&#148; He joked, making a mental note to sample her oral
        talents at an early opportunity. Then he clicked the switch on the base
        of the vibrator. &#147;Random setting, I think.&#148; 
       He eased the vibrator into her pussy, steadying Kate at the shoulder
        to help her balance as his did so. Then he tied a rope around her waist
        and threaded it between her tightly bound thighs to make a crotch rope,
        ensuring the vibrator stayed in place. 
      &#147;Okay. On the ground, sluts.&#148; Frank commanded. With their
        arms and legs tightly bound and the vibrators now pulsing inside them,
        it was becoming increasingly difficult for Kate and Lucy to remain standing.. 
      Kate bent her knees as much as the rope bindings would allow, then collapsed
        sideways onto the gravel track. She yelped as she landed on the coarse
        sharp stones. Lucy did likewise. Both rolled onto their bellies as Frank
        instructed with a imperious circular gesture of his finger. They yelped
        again as the sharp stones pricked into their breasts, bellies and thighs. 
      Having previously noticed the long loose ends of the ankle ropes, Kate
        wasn&#146;t surprised to find herself drawn up into a tight hog-tie.
        A few feet away a close-to-tears Lucy got the same treatment. He dragged
        Lucy across the gravel so she was positioned side by side with Kate.
        He used a rope to thoroughly lash the two pussygirls together whilst
        ensuring that all knots were well away from inquisitive fingers. 
      &#147;Ain&#146;t you going to gag them?&#148; Somebody asked. 
      Kate fumed as she saw Riccardo helpfully holding up two ball-gag harnesses.
        He tossed one of them to Frank who was attending to Lucy. 
      &#147;Sorry about this, kate,&#148; Riccardo said softly as he bent
        down beside her. &#147;Now, open up like a good girl and let me fit this
        on you.&#148; 
      She opened her mouth wide to accommodate the large red ball and obediently
        kept her head still is Riccardo fastened the straps about her head. 
      The hog-tied and squirming pussygirl duo proved an unexpected delight
        for the pony driver and the handful of visitors, but with an injured
        man and pony to take back to the lodge they soon quickly dispersed upon
        Frank&#146;s promise that they could see the bundled duo later. 
      One by one the pony traps departed, Jessica and Debbie were the last
        to leave. Being hog-tied and ball-gagged was bad enough - although not
        an unusual predicament - but the infuriating vibrator, the sharp gravel
        beneath her, and being tied to Lucy alongside her, added to Kate&#146;s
        irritation. 
      Lucy was furious, angrily pulling against her hog-tie as if she expected
        to break free, like the pussygirl equivalent of the Incredible Hulk.
        She especially hated having her elbows pinned together like that. The
        ropes held, and if anything became tighter because of her struggling.
        She soon descended into tears with a constant stream of dribble trailing
        from her ball-gag. Kate managed to take Lucy&#146;s hand in hers to give
        what comfort she could, just as both of their vibrators sprung into life
        again. 
      Soon both pussygirls were panting and sweating, and concentrating only
        on the vibrators&#146; erratic activities within them. With their bodies
        abutted side by side each could feel the growing arousal of the other,
        which only served to increase her own. Lucy came first; emitting a strange
        growling stifled moan, the ropes and ball-gag suppressing the full expression
        of her orgasm like the wired-on cork of a champagne bottle. 
      By the time Lucy&#146;s orgasm had subsided Kate was experiencing her
        own bitter tremors, cursing Riccardo as best she could with that infuriating
        rubber ball in her mouth. 
      ZEBRA ON THE LOOSE 
      The girl in the zebra costume continued trotting down the inclined track,
        not daring to look behind her. Each step was accompanied by an elegant
        high knee lift - the only way she knew how to move in her pony boots.
        It was perhaps fifteen minutes before she paused, turned around, and
        moved her head slowly in order to fully take in the view in her small
        circular eye holes. There was no sign that she was being followed. She
        could hear nothing but the pounding of her own heart. It seemed logical
        to keep following the track downhill, which she rightly deduced was away
        from The Lodge. 
      The track leveled and she slowed, catching the sound of running water,
        like a babbling stream. Stepping off the path she found it. A trickle
        of water fell from a large rock, like a waterfall or a shower. She stood
        under it, opening her mouth to let to cool water rush down her throat.
        It tasted like freedom! 
      Though feeling refreshed by the water, she knew she was still nothing
        more than a helpless ponygirl wondering in a hostile landscape. A helpless
        animal about to be hunted. 
      From the waterfall, she followed a track leading to a beach; a sandy
        beach so perfect she expected to see rich tourists lounging in the sun
        with five-star service waiting on their every whim. But the beach was
        eerily empty. 
      A cabin stood nearby, but she found it deserted; yet it was in immaculately
        kept order. The padded sleeping platforms in the cabin seemed to be luring
        her in, but she resisted the temptation to rest. 
      After more than a year as a human pony she had almost forgotten how
        to use her arms. Unless she was being groomed or having her costume changed
        her arms stayed firmed pinned behind her back. After the first few months
        as a ponygirl it no longer mattered. Somebody always took care of her
        feeding and her toilet for her. A ponygirl didn&#146;t need hands, they
        kept telling her. Eventually she believed them. 
      Now, she realized she would have to look after herself. There was nobody
        to feed her or change her, or groom her, or remove her butt-tail so she
        could defecate. 
      She pulled and stretched her shoulders, fighting against the strap around
        her chest. The straps didn&#146;t yield. They never did. 
      Looking hopefully around the cabin, she realized it contained nothing
        that could be used as a cutting tool. Her hands would remain locked behind
        her, but she was still optimistic. She&#146;d soon be unlocked when somebody
        found her! She left the cabin and walked slowly along the beach. 
      Her attention switched to her butt-tail. She hated that big fat plug
        inside her. Knowing that it held her former crowning glory of long blonde
        hair it was a mental torment as well as a physical one. She squatted
        down so she could trap the hair between her ankles. Pressing her heels
        together, she tried to stand, but instead of pulling out the plug she
        just toppled over, getting a mouthful of sand for her trouble. 
      The butt plug with its wide insert and narrow neck, held its position.
        She needed to use more force. Squatting and gripping the hair between
        her heels again, she closed her eyes and braced herself. She counted
        out loud - three, two, one... 
      She stood up forcefully, crying with pain; a terrible pain so much worse
        that she expected. Something had torn inside her, though at least the
        plug was on the ground, soiled and bloody. She felt a warm trickle down
        one thigh. Her blood. 
      With a sorrowful glance at her long blonde hair laying discarded in
        the sand, the zebra girl moved on, unaware that she was leaving a speckled
        bloody trail behind her. 
      Further along the beach she came across some heavy wooden constructions.
        At first she though it might be an outdoor gymnasium but looking closer
        she noticed the heavy chains embedded into thick wooden pillars. These
        chains were designed for holding and punishing slavegirls, she was sure
        of it. With a cold shiver of fear she recalled a time when she was chained
        to a similar pillar for three straight days. Yet even that was preferable
        to being one of Cavallo&#146;s ponygirls! 
      She caught sight of another wooden construction, similar to a door frame,
        but perhaps a little wider. Chains hung down from the top corners, perfect
        for holding up someone&#146;s arms. But it was the structure at the bottom
        of the door frame that most attracted her attention. A phallic shape
        pointed upwards from the base. She looked upwards to the top of the door
        frame trying to figure out how it was used. A woman kneels there, has
        her hands chained above her, stretching towards the top corners of the
        doorframe, and as she sits, she is skewered by the steel phallus. 
      Not even the tingling pain of her anal tear could detract from the anticipation
        she felt at seeing that phallus. It had been nearly a year since anything
        larger than the tip of a finger had been in her vagina. Thoughts of her
        escape had been overtaken by thoughts of being fixed into that device.
        Having her arms held up in chains and feeling nine inches of thick knobbly
        steel inside her and pushing up against her cervix was all she could
        think about. It seemed like heaven. 
      There was a major obstacle to her pleasure - the small padlock used
        to keep her labia locked shut. It was only usually removed for cleaning
        and sanitary inspections. It never really bothered her, in fact she&#146;d
        become used to its reassuring little weight between her legs. But now
        she was cursing that little padlock. 
      She knelt down to moisten the phallus with her mouth, but the T-bar
        piercing her tongue made it impossible for her to put her mouth fully
        around it. All she could do was dribble and use her lips on the phallus&#146;s
        stainless steel dome. It tasted salty from the sea breeze. 
      She turned around, her pulse racing with sexual excitement. Then she
        backed up on her shins until she felt the phallus come into contact with
        her little padlock. Just the feel of something rubbing sensitively along
        her labia was an unspeakable joy. As her desperate masturbatory foreplay
        continued she pressed down harder and harder on the phallus, pretending
        that a lover was trying to force his way into her. 
      The labial padlock was now her worst enemy; proving highly effective
        at protecting her chastity. Her eyes welled with tears of frustration
        and misery as she repeatedly banged the padlock onto the phallus. 
      REFRESHMENT 
      (Kate) 
       
      It was a long, exhausting and multi-orgasmic hour before Kate and Lucy
        were finally collected from their lonely outpost. Still comprehensively
        lashed together in their double hog-tie, they were lifted as one onto
        the pony trailer. A dark green cargo netting was thrown over them and
        secured to the edges of the trailer. Sometimes the handlers took a cruel
        pleasure in treating them as is they were nothing more than sacks of
        potatoes. 
      A half-hour journey brought them back to the courtyard of The Lodge.
        They were lifted down onto the block paved surface, still fixed in their
        double hog-tie. Activity was all around, pony boots trotting past in
        various directions, just inches away from their noses. They pleaded as
        sweetly as they could with whoever walked past, looking up with puppy-dog
        eyes and gently pleading into their ball-gags. Their efforts garnered
        no more than a few amused glances. Everybody, it seemed, had higher priorities. 
      Pussygirl Sara had a small table set up at the edge of the courtyard,
        and was busy serving glasses of iced lemonade from a large jug. Made
        with juicy lemons from the Island&#146;s orchard, Kate and Lucy knew
        how refreshing it could be. Just the thought of it had them salivating.
        Sara had spotted them but could do nothing except flash a sympathetic
        frown in their direction, before quickly resuming her mandatory pussygirl
        smile. It seemed that everyone except the ponygirls were enjoying the
        refreshment, whilst Kate and Lucy had &#145;lemonade denial&#146; added
        to their existing tortures. 
      One of the gardeners was watering the plant displays that lined the
        courtyard. He was just minding his own business dragging the long hose
        around the various displays, with only an occasional glance at the scenes
        of bondage and punishment surrounding him. Bruce went to him for a quiet
        word. He had a favour to ask and pointed to where Kate and Lucy lay.
        The gardener was happy to oblige and dragged the hose towards the hog-tied
        girls. 
      Kate and Lucy received the kind of soaking usually given to newly planted
        saplings. Chilly water splashed down their trussed-up bodies from head
        to toe until they were drenched like drowned rats. Both were left shivering
        from the shock of the water. 
      Surely everyone had had their amusement at her expense, Kate thought.
        She hoped that Bruce would now untie them, but watched dejectedly as
        he led ponygirls Diana and Melinda away. 
      He unlocked his ponies from the shaft&#146;s securing points and led
        them to the whipping bar, occupying two of the six places on the worn
        wooden rail. Ponygirls Diana and Melinda bent forward so he could attach
        the bar&#146;s retaining clips to their nipple and labia rings. 
      It was a routine punishment; the kind delivered every day for the ponygirls&#146; accumulated
        infringements. Today they earned five strokes of the cane each. No matter
        which one of the ponies was guilty of the errors, the punishment was
        delivered equally to both. 
      As routine as it may have been, the pain of each strike affirmed that
        it was most definitely a punishment. Bruce never rushed his delivery,
        particularly when there were guests watching in the courtyard. His slow
        delivery gave him adequate time to enjoy a cigarette or two as he worked.
        He was a strict adherent to the rule that if the lash didn&#146;t connect
        well enough to reach the required pain threshold it should be repeated. 
      Having delivered the punishments, with only two retakes deemed necessary,
        Bruce unclipped his ponygirls from the bar. Ponygirl Diana looked at
        him with an expression of betrayal, not comprehending why her loyal and
        willing efforts should have earned such a callous beating. Ponygirl Melinda,
        generally considered the surliest of all the ponygirls, looked at Bruce
        with bitter resentment. He loved the way she performed so well as a ponygirl
        regardless of her apparent hatred of him. That was what ponygirl training
        was all about. 
      Only after Bruce had taken his ponygirls back to their quarters did
        he attend to Kate and Lucy. As pussygirls they were allowed a degree
        of freedom within the Lodge, so he had only to release them, and send
        them scurrying back to their respective quarters. Lucy had the humiliating
        task of cleaning up the implements that had tormented her and Kate for
        the last few hours. She disappeared into a back door of the Lodge, her
        arms loaded up with ropes, vibrators and ball-gags. 
      &#147;What&#146;s all the activity was for?&#148; Kate enquired of pussygirl
        Sara, who was still busy at her lemonade stand.  
      &#147;A hunting party,&#148; Sara replied, unable to disguise her excitement. &#147;Everybody&#146;s
        going. The bitch Cavallo and other guests are leaving in the morning,
        and she wants her ponygirl found!&#148; 
      After quickly downing a glass of lemonade Kate returned to the medical
        suite. She&#146;d almost forgotten about the injured ponygirl and driver
        that would require her nursing skills. Doctor Schmidt was setting the
        driver&#146;s broken arm just as Kate walked in. 
      &#147;What kept you?&#148; The doctor called out, without even glancing
        at her. &#147;Get dressed for work.&#148; 
      Kate breezed into the ward, bent down to kiss the Doctor&#146;s shoes
        then went to the bathroom to get ready. There was no need to take a shower
        as she&#146;d already had a thorough hose-down. After a quick blow with
        the hairdryer she applied makeup to her lips and eyes, then she plaited
        her straight blonde hair into a thick single tail, finally pinning on
        her starched nurse&#146;s cap, just the way Doctor Schmidt liked it. 
      Minutes later Kate emerged in her uniform of white stockings and garters,
        and the tiniest white apron. Strappy high-heeled mules, also in white,
        gave her posture a sexy lift. 
      From the front view she was cute, the stocking tops and garter visible
        beneath the hem of the apron. And, of course, there was her smile. 
      From the side she was delicious with the roundness of her breasts pressing
        on the bib of the apron. Doctor Schmidt was sorry to observe their gradual
        diminishing now that Kate was off the lactation program. 
      Yet it was her rear view that received the most second glances. Her
        plaited ponytail swishing across her bare shoulder blades whilst the
        dangling ends of bow around her waist brushed provocatively from side
        to side over her peachy buttocks as she walked. 
      The doctor really liked his new nurse. Not only was she good-looking
        with an irrepressible smile and personality, she was also, to his surprise,
        a very good nurse. 
      Kate attended to the ponygirl laying out on the bed. Her arms had been
        unstrapped from her harness and laid at her sides, each connected to
        the bed frame with its built-in cuffs. The bit gag was still locked between
        her teeth. Her driver, sitting up on the other bed as the doctor plastered
        his arm, made it clear that that was how she must stay. He didn&#146;t
        want the ponygirl running her mouth off to anyone. 
      The driver departed the medical suite with his plastered right arm in
        a sling. He had insisted on being treated before his ponygirl, which
        didn&#146;t impress the Doctor. 
      While Dr Schmidt cut away the leather of the pony boot he allowed Kate
        to talk to the girl. It would distract her from the pain, he figured.
        The boot came off with a scream of pain from the girl, just as he predicted.
        Kate was holding the girl&#146;s hand at the time but it didn&#146;t
        return her squeeze. 
      &#147;Now we can remove that bit.&#148; The Doctor announced with a
        smile. Kate located the wing-nut in the girl&#146;s mouth, turning it
        until it came off, thus allowing the bit&#146;s removal. 
      The Doctor prodded around in the girl&#146;s mouth with his fingers,
        inspecting the metal fixture. &#147;Mien Gott! They remove two back teeth,
        screw the bar into the jaw, and then pierce the tongue with the other
        bar... 
      &#147;It&#146;s... it&#146;s ingenious,&#148; he proclaimed with admiration, &#147;...but
        also rather cruel I think.&#148; 
      Kate fingered the shiny black collar that made the ponygirl&#146;s neck
        look so slim. It had to be constricting her, Kate thought. She lifted
        the girl&#146;s head from the pillow and saw that zips on the hood and
        body suit terminated and locked together neatly under the back of the
        collar. Kate was disappointed. She wanted to see take the hood off to
        see what the girl&#146;s face looked like. The doctor read Kate&#146;s
        mind and passed her the cutters he&#146;d used on the boot. 
      It took just a few moments to snip off the stretchy black and white
        hood. The girl was blonde haired, blue-eyed and beautiful. Though her
        hair was cut very short, there was no doubting that the long hair of
        the in-situ butt-tail had been the girl&#146;s own. Kate learned something
        else too: The ponygirl&#146;s arms were paralyzed by regular injections
        to render them flaccid and easy to manage, though the ponygirl conceded
        that it did make the harnessing less painful. 
      Doctor Schmidt said he&#146;d be away ten minutes checking the X-rays
        and completing a couple of other tasks. All Kate had to do was keep the
        ponygirl company while he was gone. It wasn&#146;t a difficult task.
        Her name was Amy, she said in answer to Kate&#146;s first question. 
      &#147;This is nice, Amy,&#148; Kate said to the ponygirl, touching the
        gold labial padlock with genuine envy. She toyed with it, tugging gently,
        and realized that her actions were well-received by the ponygirl. &#147;The
        bunnies here have to wear a little plastic chastity belt that covers
        the whole area, but with just a little padlock you can still have fun;
        you just can&#146;t be penetrated. For example, I could put my finger
        inside you... like this.&#148; 
      Kate started to do what every patient fantasizes a nurse doing. Just
        the lightest touch of her finger across Amy&#146;s clitoris place the
        sexually deprived ponygirl at her mercy. 
      &#147;Tell me when to stop.&#148; Kate instructed her patient as she
        continued fingering the ever moistening folds. For the next ten minutes
        the girl cried out many things but stop wasn&#146;t one of them. 
      AN IMPORTANT MEETING 
      &#147;Don&#146;t you have them fitted with trackers?&#148; 
      &#147;NO!&#148; Madame Cavallo shouted back. &#147;How the hell was
        I supposed to know you&#146;d be releasing her into the wild? No slave
        has ever or will ever escape from my estate, so why should I fit them
        with tracking devices?&#148; 
      The emergency meeting in the Lodge boardroom was getting nowhere. The
        ponygirl competition had become a fiasco. A driver with a broken arm,
        a ponygirl with a broken ankle, another ponygirl missing, all thanks
        to Riccardo and Kate. At least that was how Cavallo and a few other visitors
        saw it. 
      The meeting agreed to award the overall ponygirl winner&#146;s prize
        to Cavallo&#146;s black ponygirls, but that only went a small way to
        assuaging the woman&#146;s anger. The fact that Riccardo stopped racing
        in order to aid her other pair was not viewed with great sympathy considering
        the mess-up that it had caused. 
      Other matters soon found themselves on the ever-widening agenda of the
        meeting. First there was the armless girl in Thailand, the one Master
        Alex had set off to interview. News of the girl had spread fast within
        the association. Everyone knew about her rabbit tattoo, and despite their
        denials, the Rabbit Island management could not shake off the insinuations. 
      And then there was the escapee - that troublesome bunny Nancy. Everybody
        assumed she had reached the safety of the American consulate, and had
        set in chain a sequence of events that would bring major problems to
        Rabbit Island. 
      There was Karen Galtz also, the journalist who had inadvertently provided
        Nancy&#146;s means of escape. She was safely locked in the cells now,
        but how many people did she tell before reaching the island? Rabbit Island&#146;s
        identity had been blown open. They were increasingly convinced of it. 
      Madame Cavallo and two other estate owners tabled a motion that Rabbit
        Island be temporarily shut down to protect the integrity of the wider
        association. It was due for a refurbishment in six months anyway, it
        was simply a matter of bringing forward the date. While other association
        members are here, they argued, why not reallocate the Rabbit Island slaves
        and let them leave with the temporary owners? 
      Without Alex to defend their corner, the other Rabbit Island board members
        felt powerless against the majority view of the association. It was suggested
        a vote be taken the following morning - a vote to determine whether Rabbit
        Island should be shut down with immediate effect.

      DOUBLE HARNESSING 
      There was one thing all ponygirls hated, that was being harnessed-up
        twice in the same day. Two sessions of strapping, binding, locking and
        being threaded with reins; two sets of cleaning, and two sets of routine
        punishments. It was enough to take the spring out of a ponygirl&#146;s
        stride, except that she dared not, for fear of further punishment. 
      Late in the afternoon, and long after the disastrous cross-country race
        had finished, Jessica and Debbie were relaxing in the pony quarters.
        Having already bathed, they sat in unashamed nakedness at the large table,
        polishing their leather harnesses and boots and chatting about the events
        of the day; the escaped ponygirl, theirs and Kate&#146;s subsequent,
        totally unjustified, punishment. 
      They heard the call on the tannoy, &#147;Ten minutes to harness!&#148; Both
        cursed loudly. 
      The Masters had decided to organize a posse to round up Cavallo&#146;s
        missing ponygirl. Every available ponygirl was required for duty, buckled
        and clipped to the shafts of their traps. Soon three pairs of Rabbit
        Island ponygirls were trotting away from the Lodge to the far corners
        of the island. 
      Somehow, despite their tiredness, Jessica and Debbie managed to pull
        their trap with their usual well-drilled and highly regulated trot. It
        helped that their bodies were controlled not by their own minds but by
        Riccardo, their driver. With his expert use of the reins and judicious
        application of the whipper he knew how to squeeze every last drop of
        effort from them. Never was the sporting clich&#233; of giving 110% more
        apt. 
      Jessica&#146;s leather-bound body was aching as she puffed her way up
        another long slope. Any slacking on her part would bring punishment,
        not just for her but equally to Debbie, harnessed at her left hand side.
        Jessica&#146;s teeth clamped down hard onto the bridle&#146;s rubber
        bit as the whipper continued its stinging assault on her red-raw buttocks. 
      Alongside Riccardo sat Vince, rifle in hand, his eagle-eyes scanning
        the horizon in search of his prey. He cared little for the view six feet
        ahead of him, Jessica and Debbie&#146;s delectable strapped up bodies.
        After two years on Rabbit Island the sight had become over-familiar. 
      Vince would just as soon be riding an all-terrain quad bike, while Riccardo
        much preferred the eco-friendly alternative. He was happy to have left
        the ugly roar of engines behind him for the gentle rhythm sound of bells
        on the ponygirls&#146; boots. To him, that epitomized Rabbit Island.  
      He liked how his ponygirls puffed and panted and strained every sinew
        for him. Even though the ponygirls endured the strict bondage of their
        harnesses and received the constant attention of the whip, it still felt
        like he and the ponies were a team, loyal and committed, sharing success
        and failure alike. 
      Sometimes, particularly when he was the only rider on the pony-trap&#146;s
        bench seat it seemed that Jessica and Debbie actually enjoyed their running;
        driven on, not just his whipping but by their own need to expend their
        pent-up energy. (Dr. Schmidt&#146;s steroid and stimulant regime had
        much to do with that.) But at this moment it was very different, pulling
        two men and a heavily laden trap at the end of a long day. Jessica and
        Debbie wouldn&#146;t be making any progress without Riccardo&#146;s insistent
        driving. There was no willingness on their part, but neither was there
        any rebellion. Riccardo whipped, and somehow they responded, even though
        at that moment they hated him for his cruelty. 
      Things improved as they descended the winding trail leading to one of
        the beach cabins. The whipping finally ceased.as they coasted home, halting
        when the gravel trail turned abruptly to beach sand. Jessica and Debbie
        were trying to get their breath back, panting and groaning, bending forward
        as much as their connecting straps permitted.  
      RETURN TO THE BEACH 
       
      Riccardo dismounted and attended to his ponygirls; it was always the first
      thing a driver did. He removing Jessica&#146;s bit from her mouth, squirting
      a long stream of water down her throat before then pushed the thick rubber
      bit back between her teeth. Riccardo&#146;s comment of &#145;good girl&#146; was
      all she got for her efforts. Debbie received the same paltry reward. 
       
      The ponygirls had mixed feelings about what Riccardo did next. He unlocked
        the small padlocks attaching the reins to their nipple rings, and began
        to unthread them from the steel rings in their labia. They were staying
        a while, that much was obvious, and the sights and sounds of other people
        intimated that some were staying the night. 
      Clipping a chain to Jessica&#146;s left and Debbie&#146;s right nipple
        rings Riccardo led his ponygirls onto the beach. It was hard to walk
        in the sand wearing their thick heel-less pony-boots, so their progress
        was cautious and stumbling. They rounded the wooden cabin where Jessica
        had lived when she first came to the island. 
      Four other ponygirls were already corraled around a palm tree; joined
        by a thin chain that passed loosely through each of their nipple rings.
        Jessica and Debbie joined their erotic chain gang, gratefully falling
        to their knees amongst the exposed roots of the palm. Nods and grunts
        passed between them. A bit-gag doesn&#146;t actually do much to prevent
        conversation, but it wasn&#146;t permitted, as as a matter of habit they
        seldom bothered, knowing they could talk freely back at the pony quarters.
        For now they were glad to sit down and rest their tired legs. 
      Jessica gazed out at the warm blue sea; so inviting, the shish sound
        of the tide on the sand bringing back pleasant memories. She became nostalgic
        for those first few months on the island, when she was called a bunny;
        a general-purpose sex-slave and plaything. When she wasn&#146;t required
        at the Lodge the so-called bunnies spent their days by themselves in
        the demi-paradise of this beach. They lived with hands behind them in
        handcuffs, and a chain connecting the cuffs to the back of a leather
        collar. Despite the muscle aching and sheer inconvenience of the semi-permanent
        bondage, that era still seemed like luxury. It was amazing, the fun that
        she and seven other chained girls could have when left to their own devices.
        Jessica learned a lot! 
      While the ponygirls rested, some falling asleep on top of others, activities
        continued around the beach cabin. A large fire was lit, and food prepared. Hunter&#146;s
        Rabbit was the appropriate supper dish, everything sourced locally.
        Pussygirl Kate skinned the rabbits while pussygirl Lucy prepared the
        tomatoes, mushrooms and onions. 
      Both pussygirls wielded sharp kitchen knives, glinting in the late afternoon
        sun as they cut and chopped. It scarcely occured to them the knives could
        be used against their captors. There were just too many men, and most
        of them carried firearms; so there could only be one outcome of a pussygirl
        rebellion. It wouldn&#146;t happen; they knew it and the men knew it. 
      The was a murmur of excitement as the news spread. Even the chained
        ring of ponygirls had picked up on it The missing ponygirl&#146;s tail
        had been found nearby. Spots of blood had laid a trail that some hunters
        were currently following. They were optimistic that the escapee would
        soon be recaptured, trussed up in a suitably humiliating fashion, to
        become the focal point of the evening&#146;s festivities. It wouldn&#146;t
        just be a punishment for the escapee but would serve as a strong warning
        for the other ponygirls. 
      Darkness fell quickly, as it always did in these tropical climes. The
        hunters returned empty-handed and mystified. The trail of blood and her
        hoof prints led to the water&#146;s edge then disappeared as if she had
        swam off. Despite their scouring of the coast, no further sign could
        be found. 
      The dejected hunters set to work on the six ponygirls, unlocking their
        circle and arranging them side-by-side. They were made to kneel, bent
        over a primitive low wooden bench on which their bellies rested. Pony-booted
        ankles were lashed to the ankles of the pony either side of her, keeping
        knees well apart. Their tails, still firmly plugged in their asses brushed
        the sand between their knees. The chain threaded through all their nipple
        rings was still connecting them, obliging each to stay leaning forward,
        least she tug on her neighbors. Jessica found the clinking, jarring movements
        as the small chain links passed through her nipple rings both comforting
        and stimulating, knowing that her sister ponygirls were the cause of
        the sensation. It&#146;s good to feel... connected. 
      Supper was served by the light of flaming torches and several small
        fires. Kate and Lucy performed their waitress functions diligently, trying
        not to attract attention to themselves. Pretty and blonde, and the only
        females that weren&#146;t bound up, it was an impossible task. Ten irritable
        and frustrated men ate their food, disappointed not to have captured
        the runaway ponygirl. On Rabbit Island there was always a woman to take
        out your frustrations on. Kate and Lucy, in their sexy white corset dresses,
        whilst serving the food, were beginning to attract lingering and lustful
        glances. 
      A distraction came when people were spotted approaching along the beach;
        half a dozen dark silhouettes shuffling through the sand. 
      &#147;That must be dessert.&#148; One of the men joked. 
      He was right, in a way. Erik, the Lodge&#146;s slave coordinator, arrived
        with five naked females in tow. Each had her wrists locked behind her.
        A long chain to their side connected them, keeping them in an orderly
        line. Each woman wore a small backpack, which contained the implements
        of her upcoming torments. 
      &#147;Did someone order five bunnies?&#148; Erik enquired, feigning
        innocence. 
      &#147;Mine&#146;s the pepperoni!&#148; Vince joked.  
      &#147;Everything you need is in their back packs,&#148; Erik explained. &#147;A
        hammer and wooden stakes, clothespins, beanbags, clamps, whips, various
        gags, vibrators, plugs, lubricant, and lots of rope.&#148;  
      He started removing the chains from his naked slaves, whilst others
        were already opening the backpacks, disgorging their contents onto the
        sand with the eagerness of kids at Christmas. 
      Kate and Lucy cleared away the plastic plates and cutlery, glancing
        across to where the newly arrived bunnies were being divested of the
        chains and backpacks. Each found herself in the strong grip of a man.
        One cuff was removed from a wrist, the backpack slipped off her shoulders,
        then the cuff was clicked down on her wrist again. 
      The bunnies were never given a moment&#146;s freedom from bondage. It
        was a badge of honor to be considered a security risk; unlike the pussygirls,
        who had relinquished all self-respect in consorting with their captors.
        Weak-willed, treacherous blondes! Kate couldn&#146;t argue with her former
        friends&#146; assessment, she felt guilty about it. However, always the
        pragmatist, she was happy with her role as a pussygirl and especially
        happy with her nursing responsibilities. 
      Two men were at work in a flat area of sand. The heavy clop of mallets
        against wooden stakes sounded like a row of tents were being laid out.
        To the long-suffering bunnies, that familiar sound had a different meaning;
        it signified they would soon be feeling the strain of outstretched limbs. 
      One by one the five naked bunnies were uncuffed and rearranged on the
        sand. First up was Rachel, the leggy, blonde Texan. Vince and another
        man knotted ropes around each slim wrist and ankle. Then, with a man
        escorting her at each elbow, she was led to the campsite-that-wasn&#146;t. 
      &#147;You know the routine, babe.&#148; Vince said. 
      Rachel dropped sullenly to the sand within a rectangle of wooden stakes.
        Without prompting, she laid back and pointed her hands and feet towards
        the four corners, stretching her fingers to within six inches of the
        stakes. Vince and Tony fixed Rachel&#146;s limbs to the four stakes;
        first tying her wrists, then pulling a leg each, towards its respective
        stake, hauling on the rope as if securing cargo, to leave Rachel as taut
        as a bowstring and struggling for breath within her flattened rib cage. 
      The mark of quality in such a bind was in seeing her fingers reaching hopelessly
      towards the knot of rope around the stakes. A good ropemaster liked to
      see her fingertips come up short of the knots by a tantalizing couple of
      inches.  
       
      Karen Galtz was next for the &#145;sand angel' treatment. The trouble-making
      journalist was not enjoying her Rabbit Island experience so far, having
      been singled out for &#145;special&#146; treatment since her capture. She
      looked unmistakable because of her smooth, freshly-shaved bald head which
      was segmented by the black straps of her harness ballgag. As far as she
      knew, she was the only one on the island with a shaved head, and though
      it wasn&#146;t her fault, she still felt a peculiar sense of shame, like
      part of her womanhood had been taken from her. 
       
      The unfairness of her treatment over the last week was eating into her
        soul. Why couldn&#146;t they just treat her like the other bunnies, she
        lamented. If only she could be treated like an ordinary bunny it wouldn&#146;t
        be so bad. 
      Three other bunnies soon joined Rachel and Karen in the sand. Those
        on either side of Rachel were fixed on the opposite direction, so their
        ankles tied to the same stakes as Rachel&#146;s wrists. 
       Being spread-eagled between four points was not enough for what the
        men had in mind. Additional ropes were tied between the adjacent elbows
        and knees of neighboring bunnies. Any movement or struggle by one would
        transmit to her neighbors.  
      Rachel was grinding her ass into the coarse sand, unable to keep from
        writhing, as she acclimatized to her stretched-out limbs. There was something
        primeval and animalistic about being tied like this, like an insect trapped
        in a giant spider&#146;s web. 
      In common with other residents on Rabbit Island, Rachel had a predilection
        for bondage and masochism long before her arrival, in fact for all her
        sexually-active life. Her husband, a crook masquerading as a businessman,
        didn&#146;t share her tastes. He wanted a beautiful blonde trophy wife.
        She wanted a man to call Master; she wanted to be lashed to the bedposts
        and brutally taken; she wanted a leather collar. He thought she was sick
        in the head and resolved to be rid of her. It came as a pleasant surprise
        to discover how easy it was to exchange her for $150,000 in negotiable
        bonds. The kidnappers took care of everything after just one phone call!
        As the buyer requested he prepared a list of her sexual preferences (or
        perversions as he saw them).  
      Though Rachel was a slave, to be used for the gratification of others,
        the Rabbit Island administration ensured that a woman&#146;s own needs
        (as detailed on Rachel&#146;s list) would not be neglected. On Rabbit
        Island it&#146;s amazing how often the latter coincides with the former. 
      BUNNY BAGS II 
       
      The five outstretched bunnies were blindfolded with airline-style sleeping
      masks. From their darkness they could hear the ominous schwish of
      small bean bags being tossed in the air as two players became accustomed
      to the various weights, warming up for their first throws. 
       
      Standing at the far end of the row of spread-eagled bunnies, a player
        lobbed his first beanbag. It traveled the full length of the pitch, and
        landed heavily onto Rachel&#146;s belly. She squealed at the shock of
        the impact, its suddenness was far worse than the pain. The blindfold
        was an unnecessary cruelty. Butt unnecessary cruelties are much more
        fun than necessary cruelties! 
      Further throws followed as each player tried for a full-house - a beanbag
        on each of five nervous straining bellies. Once all the beanbags were
        thrown the players move between the bunnies, inspecting the positions.
        If you&#146;ve landed on a bunny then you&#146;re entitled to clip a
        clothespin onto one of her nipples. 
      The players moved to the other end of the row and threw again with the
        same objective. It resulted in clothespins being attached onto the bunny&#146;s
        other nipple.  
      Rachel&#146;s swollen nipples each sported a clothespin, ready for the
        second (and much harsher) part of the game. This time a player has to
        dislodge his opponent&#146;s clothespins for the bunnies&#146; nipples
        by aiming the beanbag straight at the breast. Unlike the careful underarm
        lobs employed in the first stage of the game, this dislodging stage required
        a much more vigorous technique.  
      Rachel yelped as she felt a sudden and painful hit of a beanbag on the
        side of her breast. It missed the clothespin completely. That was bad
        news, as she would have to endure another attempt. 
      The next throw was a hit, sending the clothespin flying off another
        bunny&#146;s nipple, clicking in the air. The bunny cried out with pain
        while the thrower gave a juvenile whoop of triumph. 
      For the likes of Rachel, blindfolded, nipples clamped with clothespins
        and stretched out on the sand, it wasn&#146;t such a bad way of spending
        a couple of hours. 
      KATE&#146;S EMBARRASSMENT 
      While further games of bunny bags took place, the non-players
        continued drinking beer and enjoying the view, not of the setting sun
        over a tropical blue sea, but of the ponygirls, six of them kneeling
        in a row, with their bellies resting across a low wooden bench. Riccardo
        attended to the campfire, toasting marshmallows, heating up the brands
        and regaling the visitors with interesting tales of Rabbit Island life. 
      &#147;The ponies are getting restless,&#148; someone observed. That
        much was true. They&#146;d been worked hard all day, and were distressed
        (actually very annoyed!) to find themselves still in harness and a long
        way from the comfort of their pony quarters. 
      The row of muscular yet still feminine asses, each accessorized with
        their pony tail-plugs, was exercising the thoughts of several men.  
      &#147;Riccardo. These ponygirls...&#148; An Australian visitor commented,
        pointing towards them with a beer-bottle wielding hand, &#147;Is it right,
        we&#146;re not allowed to fuck &#145;em?&#148; 
      &#147;That&#146;s right. Not just the visitors, the same applies to
        all the staff. When they&#146;re not dressed as ponies, the girls are
        fair game, but never when in harness. They live by rules and discipline,
        we don&#146;t want to confuse the poor things, do we?&#148;  
      Riccardo made the men laugh, just as he intended, though the interest
        of a couple of men was more physical than intellectual. That wasn&#146;t
        surprising, the visual eroticism of the ponygirls was expressly designed
        to stimulate their desire, whilst the don&#146;t-fuck-the-ponygirls rule
        ensured that there was always a sexual tension as befitted such a place
        as Rabbit Island. 
      &#147;And what about you Riccardo? You mean you&#146;ve never dipped
        into them when they&#146;re all strapped up?&#148; the Australian asked. 
      Riccardo shook his head. &#147;No... never... I&#146;ve felt them up a
      few times though, and I can tell by their wetness that sometimes they&#146;d
      gladly open their legs for me,&#148; he admitted with a satisfied smile.  
&#147;Women are such jealous creatures that when you&#146;re working a pair of
ponygirls it&#146;s better to keep a check on your feelings. Not only do they
have to think as one, but behave as one also. Often they hate me, and occasionally
they love me, but they always do it as a team.&#148; 
       
      Riccardo&#146;s pride was unmistakeable. Kate listened intently, almost
        jealously, as she kept a watch on the foil-covered baked potatoes in
        the fire. Riccardo&#146;s descriptions made the ponygirl sound like a
        noble calling, unlike her own role, as a semi-consensual slut with a
        sideline in nursing. 
      &#147;I remember you, blondie,&#148; said the Australian. It took a
        moment before Kate realized he was talking to her; all pussygirls were
        blonde. Kate looked up from the fire into his blue eyes. Yes, it was
        definitely her he was talking to. Remembered her from where, she wondered?
        She&#146;d hardly managed to keep a low profile in the last week. Everything
        she did seem to attract attention, usually of the wrong kind. 
      &#147;It was that game where you had to wear the strap-on dildo,&#148; he
        explained. 
      Kate wilted with embarrassment. Why did people have to constantly mention
        that! 
      &#147;Yeah, that&#146;s right. You had your hands tied behind your back
        and had to use the strap-on dildo on the row of girls who were bent over
        a rail.&#148; 
      &#147;Oh yes, I remember,&#148; said Kate, as if she had almost forgotten
        one of the most embarrassing moments of her life. 
      &#147;You can to redeem yourself tonight,&#148; the Aussie guest said,
        with a gesture towards the conveniently presented asses of the ponygirls.
        He looked over towards Riccardo for approval. 
      Riccardo gave a latin shrug. He wasn&#146;t aware the pussygirls were
        forbidden for interfering with the ponygirls. Men yes, but not pussygirls.
        Besides, it may provide a little amusement for the guests. They pay a
        lot of money to be here, after all. He consulted with Frank, who was
        normally a stickler for rules, and he was in favor. Before Kate knew
        what was happening, somebody had retrieved a strap-on dildo harness. 
      &#147;Strip, bitch!&#148; commanded Frank.  
      Pussygirl Lucy helped to unlace the back of Kate&#146;s dress. 
      Refusal was not an option for Kate. She&#146;d be slapped in permanent
        cuffs, severely punished, and dispatched to the cells in an instant.
        Her white dress fell slipped down her slim and tanned frame to the sand,
        leaving her clad in white stockings and basque, the lick of flame from
        the camp fire providing a seductive red and gold illumination. 
      Frank handed Lucy the dildo harness to be fitted around Kate&#146;s
        belly. She fixed the black straps tightly around her colleague&#146;s
        waist, pulling the retaining strap up between her legs, pulling tightly
        up the crack between Kate&#146;s buttocks, then buckled it in the small
        of Kate&#146;s back. The men meanwhile were chuckling into their beer.
        It was difficult to imagine a less butch woman than Kate. Nor could they
        imagine anyone who could look so cute with a nine inch erection protruding
        from her sex. &#147;Now that&#146;s what I call penis envy!&#148; the
        Aussie joked. 
      Kate&#146;s eyes flicked nervously between the men, looking for an ally. &#147;You
        want me to...&#148; 
      &#147;Yep. Take your pick. You&#146;ve six ponygirls to choose from.&#148; 
      &#147;No. Wait!&#148; Riccardo interjected, holding up a pack of playing
        cards. &#147;Let&#146;s make this more interesting. We can each draw
        a card in turn. If it&#146;s between an ace and a six, then that determines
        which ponygirl gets kate&#146;s attention. The cute-ass on at the far
        left is the ace. Then two, there, four and so on, he said pointing a
        finger at each ponygirl. 
      &#147;If the card drawn is red, pussygirl kate has to fuck her with
        the dildo. If it is a black card she spanks her. Oh, and I&#146;m also
        putting some forfeit cards in the deck, just for a little fun. If you
        draw one of those you must do what the card says. Gentlemen. Does everyone
        agree?&#148; 
      They cheerfully assented, chuckling and clapping their hands at the
        possibilities. Riccardo quickly scrawled some forfeits on a few of the
        cards and shuffled the deck. 
      He handed the deck to one of the visitors. The man turned it over and
        gleefully showed the card to the others. &#147;Three of Spades!&#148; 
      &#147;OK, kate. that&#146;s ten hits of the paddle for ponygirl debbie.&#148; Riccardo
        instructed. &#147;Off you go!&#148; 
      Debbie was gasping even before the first slap. Kneeling with her ankles
        lashed to Jessica on one side and Diana on the other, she could do nothing
        to avoid Kate&#146;s surprisingly hard strokes. The rubber bit between
        her teeth couldn&#146;t silence Debbie&#146;s angry expletives. Riccardo
        made a mental note to punish her &#145;vocalizing&#146; in the morning. 
      The next visitor drew a card. He was the young man who&#146;d worked
        on Kate in the Torture Garden. She recognized him. He was a good looking
        guy she thought at the time, with his neatly cut fair hair, and a nice
        intelligent face. 
      He seemed shocked. After cajoling from the other men, he read the card
        out loud. &#147;Kneel down. Someone will tie your hands. You will suck
        somebody&#146;s cock.&#148;  
      He threw down the card, and managed a smile, even though horrified by
        the prospect of his impending humiliation. He knelt, and allowed his
        hands to be bound with a short length of leather cord. It was a derisory,
        escapable tie compared to the strict bondage inflicted on the bunnies.
        Men are such wimps, Kate thought, what&#146;s the big deal about having
        your hands tied and giving someone a blow-job? 
      &#147;So! Who&#146;s it to be?&#148; he asked nervously, waiting for
        one of his male companions to stand up. 
      Kate stepped towards him, her virile strapped-on erection leading the
        way. The man looked up at the vision coming towards him, dressed only
        in her white stockings and a sexy basque. Even her inelegant shuffle
        through the sand didn&#146;t detract from the beguiling image. 
      &#147;Open wide!&#148; Kate teased, as the head of her cock bobbed towards
        his nervously licking lips. She liked this; a good-looking guy kneeling
        in the sand in front of her. It was unusual, this role reversal. She
        felt a delicious rush of power, particularly on noticing the nervous
        gulp in his throat as he gazed up at her with a mixture of adoration
        and fear. 
      Just a couple of days earlier this same man had delighted in tormenting
        Kate&#146;s strung-up body in the Torture Garden. Now he adoration took
        an entirely different form. When his lips encircled the dildo, Kate pulled
        the back of his head onto it. He coughed as it struck the back of his
        throat. 
       &#147;Suck it hard boy!&#148; Kate commanded, before realizing her
        performance was putting her on dangerous ground. The base of the dildo
        banged insistently against her sex as the man showed a surprising degree
        of passion. His lips pushed hopelessly towards the unattainable goal
        - her sweet, shaved pussy. 
      Another card was drawn the pack, even while Kate&#146;s reverse fellatio
        continued. 
      &#147;The four of hearts,&#148; the man announced, holding up the card
        for all to see. It was exactly what the men were waiting for, the reason
        for Kate&#146;s strap-on dildo. 
      &#147;Kate!&#148; Riccardo said, calling her performance to the end. &#147;Number
        four. Fuck her!&#148; 
      Kate turned around to face the row of ponygirls&#146; asses and counted
        along from the left. Melinda, Diana, Debbie...Jessica!  
      Riccardo beamed. This would be fun, he thought. &#147;Well, get on with
        it, kate!&#148; He called out impatiently as the pussygirl studied her
        best friend&#146;s harnessed-up body, planning her assault. 
      Jessica&#146;s ass swayed and circled as Kate approached. She knelt
        down in the V created by Jessica&#146;s kneeling legs, and prepared to
        impale her. Always a secret admirer of ponygirl harnessing, Kate ran
        her hands over Jessica&#146;s body, her fingertips slipping beneath the
        straps and Jessica&#146;s hot skin. The ponygirl&#146;s hands, strapped,
        buckled and locked fast to the waist belt behind her, formed into useless
        fists by the laced up suede covers, were a particular fascination for
        Kate. They made a good gripping point as well, like the horn of a saddle.
        Kate leant fully forward so her body was in contact with Jessica&#146;s. 
      &#147;Um, sorry about this Jessi,&#148; Kate whispered into her friend&#146;s
        ear. Jessica nodded, just like ponies do, and made a sound from behind
        her rubber bit. Giving consent perhaps? 
      Kate dug her fingernails into Jessica&#146;s buttocks, knowing how she
        liked it. She clawed harder, almost viciously, as if trying to draw blood.
        Her hands explored further, found Jessica&#146;s breasts and squeezed
        with the same claw-like action. Jessica moaned; then moaned louder as
        Kate&#146;s fingers played with the nipple rings. Kate pulled hard on
        the chain threaded through them, forgetting that it was also threaded
        through the neighboring ponygirls&#146; nipples. A chorus of irritation
        went up around her, much to the amusement of the rapt audience of men
        behind her. 
      Jessica wanted it, Kate was sure of that. She pulled her hips back,
        lifted Jessica&#146;s tale with one hand, held the dildo with the other,
        then thrust it fully into Jessica&#146;s sex. The ponygirl yelled into
        her bit as the top of the dildo contacted with her cervix. With her ankles
        tied to the ponygirl on either side of her and her nipple rings threaded
        with a securing chain, Jessica was powerless to resist being raped by
        her best friend. Her only mercy was facing into the darkness of the forest,
        the leather blinkers on her eyes providing a physical and emotional privacy.
        She could feel Kate&#146;s warm body on her back and kisses on her shoulder
        and sensed her passion. 
      Jessica fought against her straps, frustrated that with her hands bound
        closed into fists, she could not even return Kate&#146;s affection with
        so much as a fingertip. All she could offer was a crude and rhythm grunt
        every time Kate thrusted into her. 
      Two men suddenly stood up. They could take no more, so they ran over
        to join the game of bunny bags. Each quickly chose a spread-eagled bunny,
        dropped their shorts, and fell on top of her. The two players stood back
        and chuckled at the pitch invasion. Judging by the invaders&#146; urgency,
        they sensed their game wouldn&#146;t be held up for very long. 
      Rachel was one of those two targets, her long cascading blonde hair,
        spread out on the sand, and her maternal breasts pulling one of the desperate
        men onto her like a magnet. 
      For Rachel, who&#146;s predilection for the tug and stretch of a spread-eagle
        tie, there was something that made it even better still. The man duly
        obliged, slipping his erection slowly into her, and letting her body
        take the full weight of his muscular torso. When he thrusted, Rachel&#146;s
        body was jolted up the sand until it was halted by the bands of rope
        around her ankles. She was in the middle of a tug-of-war, the man&#146;s
        penis pushing, her ankles ropes restraining and resisting. 
      The man ejaculated. Rachel cursed him for coming to soon, leaving her
        hopelessly worked up, just a dozen thrusts away from her own pleasure.
        The game of bunny bags continued, with two highly agitated bunnies among
        the targets. 
      Kate, meanwhile, thought Jessica was responding well to her love-making,
        hoping also that all parties would be satisfied with her performance.
        Someone pulled her backwards; a hand grabbing the back of her belt. &#147;I
        haven&#146;t made her cum yet,&#148; Kate protested, while Jessica cried
        out in frustration when she felt the dildo vacating her hot pussy. With
        her face unseen by the men, Jessica sobbed bitterly at the last-minute
        denial of her small pleasure. 
      More cards were drawn and Kate was required to paddle another ponygirl. 
      Caught in the middle between the victim and the perpetrator, she was
        trapped and bewildered, becoming her tormentors&#146; tool and plaything.
        A protest would only bring punishment more harsh than ponygirls or bunnies
        were likely to receive. That&#146;s what happens when, on becoming a
        pussygirl, you sell your soul to the devil. Kate could tell that the
        ponygirls despised her; perhaps even Jessica did too, and now she despised
        herself. 
      Ponygirl Sandra&#146;s buttocks seemed to shift nervously in anticipation,
        bracing herself for the first strike of the paddle. Kate dutifully delivered
        the blows, each producing a hollow wop and an equivalent ponygirl
        bit-mouthed grunt, but by then it was hurting Kate more than the ponygirl. 
      Another card was drawn. The man read it aloud. &#147;Remove one of the
        ponygirls&#146; tail-plugs and lick it!&#148; He fell backwards from
        his seated position onto the sand, his eyes tightly closed in horror. &#147;No.
        You can&#146;t be serious!&#148; 
      &#147;Cheer up. You get to choose which one!&#148; said Riccardo. 
      The man flicked the card back to Riccardo, stood up and walked purposefully
        towards the row of ponygirls. Each of the ponies&#146; knees were spread
        and secured so their tails sprouted from their asses, dropping straight
        to the sand. They seemed so natural, like real tails, a impression reinforced
        by the ponygirls never being seen in public without them.  
      It was a tough decision, those six rumps, some reddened from the paddle,
        all seemed to be calling him, but he settled for number two. Diana. He
        liked the little wiggle of her butt, which was slimmer, and a little
        more delicate than the other ponies; but would that make it taste any
        better?  
      He couldn&#146;t resist running his hands over the soft curves of her
        buttocks, before gripping the tail hair near the base. He gave a little
        tug but the tail was as firmly attached to the pony&#146;s body as if
        it were her own. 
      Riccardo explained about the tail locking system. &#147;There&#146;s
        an air valve inside her rectum. You&#146;ll have to deflate that first.
        Press your thumb on the bulb hidden at the base of the tail.&#148; 
      The man did as instructed. 
      &#147;Now pull it out slowly.&#148; 
      The tail&#146;s plug emerged slowly at first, then suddenly plopped
        free from between Diana&#146;s trim buttocks. The other men edged closer
        for a better look. Diana&#146;s fecal matter had never had so much attention. 
      He held up the butt-plug, three inches long, narrow and ivory in colour
        except for a smear of her faeces. Not wanting to dwell on it, the visitor
        gave it a single tentative lick with a look of undisguised disgust writ
        across his face. Riccardo instructed him to replace it, and still with
        his face contorted like a gargoyle, he screwed it back into Diana&#146;s
        ass as if replacing the cork in a wine bottle. He yelled out for a beer,
        which he thought his bravery richly deserved. 
      Diana felt the reassuring touch of Bruce, her driver. He&#146;d come
        over to check her tail was properly inserted. He squeezed the little
        bulb-pump between thumb and forefinger and shea felt its slow expansion
        within her rectum as it locked into place. She felt properly dressed
        again. After giving a paternal slap on her butt Bruce left to return
        to his beer and the camp fire. Diana swayed her hips and felt the familiar
        tickle of the ponytail hair brushing against her inner thighs. She liked
        the sensual feel of it, and even the buttplug itself she really didn&#146;t
        mind. It&#146;s amazing what a ponygirl can come to accept given the
        correct training. 
      Kate was tired of being the instrument of men&#146;s sadism; beating
        and raping other women, while men laughed, drunk their beer and toasted
        their marshmallows. Being a figure of ridicule was worse than being sexually
        used. Her angry glare at them, hands on hips and obscenely large dildo
        pointing forward, merely amused them further. She glanced across to the
        five bunnies spread-eagled on the sand, and envied them. At least they
        still had some dignity! 
      Her ordeal ended when Doctor Schmidt, her boss, arrived on the scene.
        The brands in the fire were hot and ready 
      RABBIT BRANDING 
      Jessica believed Master Alex when he told her she would never be branded.
        When she was tied up in his bedroom for his leisurely bondage sessions,
        he&#146;d said exactly that on several occasions. Piercings? yes. Tattoos?
        Yes, though not to large; but NOT the permanence of branding. It now
        seems he lied, or perhaps was not as influential as he thought, and she
        hoped, he was. 
      Vince stood up to address the gathering. 
      &#147;In accordance with this morning&#146;s committee resolution, all
        ponygirls on the Island are to be branded to bring them into line with
        other parts of our association,&#148; he announced. &#147;Now you can
        witness and participate in the rare spectacle of a complete stable of
        ponygirls receiving the Rabbit Island brand.&#148; 
      &#147;No!&#148; Came a shout from one of the ponygirls. The bit in her
        mouth was no obstacle to basic speech. Protests from the others soon
        followed together with a token struggle and shake of their heads. 
      &#147;I didn&#146;t know ponies could speak.&#148; One of the visitors
        joked. 
      &#147;They&#146;ll wish they hadn&#146;t!&#148; Bruce replied with a
        growl. 
      Melinda and Diana were first to have the small rabbit symbol seared
        onto the lower part of the left buttock. The acrid smell of seared flesh
        wafted in the air. It left them subdued and tearful, more than fifty
        harsh strokes would have done. 
      Debbie required the weight of a man standing on the back of each calf
        whilst another gripped her head before she would hold still enough to
        receive her brand. 
      Seeing Debbie&#146;s protests and struggles amounting to nothing left
        Jessica feeling defeated even before the brander had reached her. She
        felt the bare knees of a man pressing hard against both ears, clamping
        her head as if in a vice. 
      &#147;Keep still!&#148; A man yelled, infuriated with Jessica&#146;s
        last gasp resistance. There was a tense pause as the brand was reheated
        to its red hot state, with Jessica&#146;s despairing whimper the only
        sound heard. Then she felt a scalding, searing pain in her left buttock,
        which turned her whimper to a muffled scream. Though she had suffered
        countless painful moments on Rabbit Island, no other pain carried with
        it such significance. Only cattle are branded, she thought, not people!
        Not women who have any hope or expectation of freedom. 
      The branding session was soon completed, though the smell of the burning
        and the cries of the ponygirls seemed to linger in the air. A tot of
        fine cognac suited the moment perfectly The branding iron was cooled,
        cleaned and replaced in its teak box, while six kneeling women, trussed
        in leather, contemplated their new status. For Jessica, Master Alex&#146;s
        promises were shown to be hollow and worthless. He said that in two years
        she would be free, and she believed him! The burning of the brand was
        nothing compared to the despair that had risen within her. 
      There wasn&#146;t much fun to be had from sobbing self-pitying ponygirls,
        so the men relocated the few yards along the beach to watch the final
        of the bunny bags competition.  
      
         *** 
       
      Any sense of the erotic in a ponygirl is dissipated when one of them
        has to spend the night in harness. The ponygirls were eventually freed
        from their kneeling positions, in which they received the brand. They
        were moved into a circle around the same tree as earlier, and the long
        chain passing through all their nipple rings had its ends locked together.
        One small mercy was that their wrists were released from behind their
        backs, though they remained laced within their suede confines holding
        them into fists, good for sparring, but nothing else. Their bits and
        bridles were also removed, then blankets were laid out so the ponygirls
        could sleep with a degree of comfort. There was a rule stating that ponygirls
        were to sleep laying flat, hands free and without gags/bits etc. These
        conditions had thus been met. 
      Jessica stared forlornly at her nipples, pawing at them with her suede-mitted
        hands. No longer were they the sensual pleasure receptors of her youth,
        these had grown large, strong and supple, able to withstand being skewered
        by a thick metal ring without pain. She wondered how anyone could find
        such protrusions remotely erotic. For a ponygirl they were regarded primarily
        as securing and controlling points. That night her chained nipple rings
        were all that stood between her and freedom, yet it was enough.  
      The band-aid Master Alex put on her breast yesterday was starting to
        itch. She pawed at it with her suede-bound fist trying without success
        to dislodge it.  
      &#147;You want me to take it off?&#148; Debbie asked. 
      &#147;Please, Debs.&#148; 
      Debbie&#146;s hands were no more able to remove the band-aid than Jessica&#146;s.
        Smiling coyly, Debbie leant forward and placed her mouth over the band-aid.
        WIth her mouth wide open but clamped to Jessica&#146;s breast like a
        limpit Debbie&#146;s teeth gradually found a purchase into Jessica&#146;s
        breast flesh. After much biting, her teeth were beneath the edge of the
        band-aid. Gripping an edge between her teeth Debbie pulled, taking pleasure
        in ripping of the band-aid. The simple pleasures of life never change,
        such as ripping off somebody elses band-aid! 
      &#147;It&#146;s an A,&#148; Debbie observed, slightly surprised, &#147;definitely
        an A.&#148; 
      They both knew what it signified. Jessica&#146;s eyes welled with tears.
        A man had carved his initial in her flesh! It was personal, just as the
        brand, was cruelly impersonal. 
      &#147;The cut will fade, but this brand will scar me forever. We&#146;re
        just cattle now.&#148; Jessica stated morosely. 
      &#147;It hasn&#146;t changed a thing,&#148; Debbie whispered to her. 
      &#147;I know you&#146;re right Debs, but I hate the thought of it.&#148; Jessica
        whispered back. &#147;This brand seems so final. We&#146;ve stepped down
        a rung on the evolutionary ladder. I&#146;ve kept on believing that one
        day I&#146;d be free again, but this brand says that I&#146;m wrong.&#148; Jessica
        was despondent as if all hope was now lost. 
      It was easier for Debbie to cope. She never expected to be free. She&#146;d
        seen first hand how easily sex-slaves can be transported all over the
        world with no chance of detection or escape. She&#146;d long ago settled
        for mere survival. Working as a ponygirl on Rabbit Island had been a
        big improvement on her previous slave location. Two years in quite literally
        a dungeon in an east European castle. On Rabbit Island there were better
        treatment, better food, better sex, and better weather too! If she could
        perform well as a ponygirl, and in a man&#146;s bed on occasions too,
        then she figured on being safe on Rabbit Island for the next few years.
        Beyond that, she tried not to contemplate. She&#146;s only a ponygirl
        after all, and ponies don&#146;t think too deeply, do they? 
      The six ponygirls slept in their enforced circle around the palm tree,
        using blankets and each other for their bedding. 
      Kate wasn&#146;t sleeping so well. They&#146;d tied her left wrist to
        left ankle, and right wrist to right ankle, to leave her in a kind of
        sitting position. The relative freedom of being tied thus, presented
        her as a flexible plaything, one that could be dragged, rolled, upended,
        and taken in any number of positions. When most of those positions had
        been exhausted, the men headed for the padded bedding of the adjacent
        beach cabin. 
      Kate was still tied left wrist to left ankle and right to right. She scooched
      painfully along the sand on her ass until she reached the ponygirls. She
      fell asleep alongside Jessica, and in the morning awoke in her sleeping
      friend&#146;s arms. 
       
      A GRIM DISCOVERY 
       
      Riccardo, Lucy and Kate prepared breakfast; a full, cooked breakfast naturally.
      The organically reared pigs on Rabbit Island produced a most delicious
      bacon. Kate turned the sizzling slices in the pan, savoring the aroma whilst
      cursing the fact that such food was forbidden to Rabbit Island&#146;s slavegirls.
      The camp was quiet, the visitors had set off on foot, scouring the beach
      for signs of the missing ponygirl. It was nice, Kate thought, just to be
      with the regular staff like Riccardo with none of the visitors around.
      Only another day or two and the festival would be over, and normal Rabbit
      Island peace would be restored. 
       
      With the meat cooked and ready, Kate saw the men returning, though still
        a long way in the distance. Just enough time to cook the eggs! 
      Riccardo watched the gradual approach of half a dozen men, as they turned
        from hazy specks half a mile away, into distinct outlines. He saw they
        were carrying something, then realized it was a somebody. A wooden pole
        was supported between two men&#146;s shoulders, one man six feet in front
        of the other. Slung belly-down between them with her hands and feet tied
        to the pole was the unmistakeable figure of the zebra-costumed ponygirl. 
      She didn't have much fight in her, Riccardo observed, as they came within
        fifty yards of the came. The men who carried and accompanied her walked
        in ominous silence. They lowered her body to the sand about twenty yards
        away from the campsite. 
      &#147;We found her at the water&#146;s edge,&#148; Vince said to Riccardo. &#147;She
        must have drowned. She didn&#146;t stand a chance with her arms pinned
        behind her like that. 
      Kate&#146;s nursing instinct took over as she ran to the body, but there
        was nothing to be done. &#147;She&#146;s been dead for hours.&#148; Kate
        informed Lucy, who had gone pale with shock. 
      Nobody had an appetite for breakfast; they just drank coffee, and muttered
        about whether it had been suicide or an accident. Riccardo and Kate,
        the ones who freed her from the pony trap the previous day, took it particularly
        badly, finding comfort in each other in a sad embrace. 
      It was decided to bury the girl deep within the tropical palms. She
        was cut from all her bondage, the humiliating zebra suit having to be
        sliced carefully away from her cold flesh, so that she could rest; finally
        free. Only her labial padlock remained. Its staple passing through her
        nether lips would forever to guard her sex from penetration. 
      JOURNEY BACK TO THE LODGE 
       
      It took hours for the subdued party of men to get ready to return
      to the Lodge. The remainder of the bottle of cognac had been consumed,
      for comfort rather than pleasure. Not surprisingly, some of the visitors
      had lost all further interest in the affairs and function of Rabbit Island.
      They meandered back along the beach towards the Lodge, leaving the pony
      drivers Riccardo, Frank and Bruce to prepare the ponygirls for their own
      journey along the track. For them it had to be business as usual, they
      still had a job to do. In their previous lives the three men had all seen
      death many times before, though never on Rabbit Island. 
       
      Vince untied Rachel and the other bunnies who&#146;d spent the whole
        night and much of the morning staked out on the beach. He carefully tied
        each one&#146;s hands behind her back, then with another rope linked
        the five together in a line for the long walk home. It was just a freak
        accident, he explained hoping to put their minds at rest; just one of
        those things that can happen anywhere. 
      Pussygirls Kate and Lucy were spared the long walk back because of vacant
        passenger seats on the pony traps. She was glad to be with Jessica, Kate
        thought, watching the rear view of her friend and Debbie straining to
        climb the steep track leading away from the beach. She was actually grateful
        that Riccardo lashed her hands to the backrest. There was a definite
        benefit in being tied up sometimes. It was like being granted permission
        not to think. 
      If Rabbit Island could be described in a sound, it would not be the
        screams of female torture, nor even the wop of a paddle on raw
        buttocks. No; it would be the sound that Kate was listening to as the
        three pairs of ponygirls trotted back to the lodge. The festive jingle
        of bells on the pony-boots, the crush of gravel beneath the fast-turning
        wheels and the ambiguous grunting of the ponygirls, which left their
        passengers unsure whether their groans were from pleasure and pain. 
      Reassuring as the sound of ponygirls was after the morning&#146;s traumas,
        Riccardo and Kate knew that it was only the beginning. How could things
        be the same? After the discovery of armless girl and her suspected link
        to Rabbit Island, then Nancy&#146;s successful escape, surely she would
        already have notified the relevant authorities, and now with a fatality,
        it all pointed to Rabbit Island&#146;s exposed position. 
      &#147;What&#146;s going to happen now?&#148; Kate asked Riccardo, as
        the ponygirls made steady pace along the scenic central plateau of the
        island. 
      He saw no reason to lie. &#147;I don&#146;t know. Something will happen,
        I&#146;m sure of it. Who knows, you could be a free woman within a week!&#148; 
      She laughed. Although not usually given to pessimism, freedom had become
        a distant concept to her. She stared out at the horizon, trying to remember
        what freedom was like. Free like those hovering birds in the distance! 
      To their surprise, those birds came closer, far sooner than they expected. 
      The deep throbbing warble of two helicopters assaulted their senses,
        as they flew low over the convoy of the three pony traps as if to take
        a closer look. 
      Jessica and Debbie continued to trot, not even breaking stride at the
        frightful mechanized cacophony of the helicopters. &#145;I knew Nancy
        wouldn&#146;t let us down,&#146; Jessica thought, ecstatic at her imminent
        prospects. She wanted to shout it aloud, so that Kate and Debbie could
        hear, but with the bit between her teeth, literally and metaphorically,
        she joyfully trotted towards the Lodge. And towards freedom.

      Chapter 14. The Silver Lady 
      (Even Ponygirls Sometimes Get the Blues, Aurelius) 
     
     
     
    The story so far:  
    ... 
    (Ch. 11) Master Alex collects the drugs he will administer to the armless
    girl - Jessica's nerve fails her and she binds herself to the bedpost just
    before Alex arrives. 
    (Ch. 12) During the cross-country race, one of the ponygirls escapes. Kate
    is partly responsible and severely punished. 
    (Ch. 13) The ponygirl hunting posse camp overnight at the beach. Jessica
    and the other ponygirls are branded. A tragic discovery. 
     
     BACK TO THE LODGE 
    The vast front lawns of The Lodge were unrecognizable, no longer the immaculate
      oasis of calm and order, admired equally by slaves and masters. The whole
      population of Rabbit Island, residents, visitors and domestic workers,
      were gathered there. 
    Men with broad shoulders and rippling biceps marshalled the assembled
      crowd. Clad in tight white tee-shirts and camouflage pants, and with cropped
      short hair, they looked like extras from low budget Hollywood action movie.
      The PA system, most recently used to commentate on the ponygirl events,
      was now being used to give out a barrage of orders from a deep, growling
      voice. 
    Jessica and the other ponygirls trotted across the front grounds towards
      their normal destination, the cobbled courtyard. Running at pace, with
      her sight lines blinkered, Jessica comprehended little of the scene all
      around her except sensing there was something important happening; an event
      with more urgency than celebration.
    As soon as they halted by their hitching post Riccardo jumped down from
      the seat. &#147;Holy shit. Wait here, I&#146;ll go see what&#146;s happening,&#148; he
      said, addressing Jessica and Debbie. Things had to be serious if Riccardo
      was talking to his ponygirls! He and Frank walked purposefully back to
      the front of the Lodge, but were met and blocked by two strong-armed men
      who spun them around and steered them back to their pony traps. 
    &#147;Get them unhitched, remove their locks and bring them around to
      the front,&#148; one of them barked, talking over Riccardo&#146;s request
      for answers. These guys didn&#146;t do conversations. The men moved
      towards Kate and Lucy, releasing their hands from the back rails of their
      respective seat backs. Kate&#146;s man, muscular and handsome and in his
      mid twenties, placed firm hands on her hips and helped Kate jumped down
      from the trap. He made no move to separate her leather-tied wrists. 
    Kate had once seen a TV program about SAS rescue missions; where she learned
      that everyone, including hostages, is treated as potentially hostile until
      the whole place is fully under control. Perhaps this was similar, she thought,
      as the charmless hunk of a man briskly escorted her to the front lawns,
      his vice-like fingers gripping her elbow tight enough to bruise. 
    Her heart sank as she began to comprehend what was really happening. The
      Rabbit Island handlers like Erik and Kurt were no longer in charge of events,
      that much was clear, but nor did it seem they were &#145;under arrest&#146;.
      Bunnies and slavegirls, meanwhile, remained as securely bound as ever. 
    Kate didn&#146;t understand exactly what the invaders were doing at first,
    not until she witnessed one of the naked bunnies being processed. Yes, she
    thought, processed seemed the right word. She saw pussygirl lucy laying naked
    on a white bedsheet which was spread out on the lawn. Her hands and feet
    were bound then the bedsheet was wrapped tightly around her from head to
    toe. Silver-grey gaffer tape was passed around her wrapped-up body in several
    places. Once she was securely bundled she was hooded with a white pillow
    slip. Its opening was gathered around her neck with several turns of tape,
    giving the impression of a snug-fitting collar. 
     
    Two men carried the Lucy&#146;s helpless body to the end of the line -
      a line consisting of more than thirty similarly bound bodies. 
    Then it was Kate&#146;s turn. They finally removed the leather cords from
      her wrists but she was powerless as three men surrounded her, undressing
      her, but showing little interest in her white corset, or the delights of
      her flesh that the corset&#146;s removal had revealed. They bound her hands
      behind her back with strong plastic ties like those used by the U.S. army,
      one on each wrist, interlinked together. She heard a zipping sound as the
      plastic ratcheted down on each wrists; then two snips as they clipped off
      their trailing ends. The efficiency of it chilled her. 
    &#147;Sixty-nine!&#148; One of her captors called out, having located
      Kate&#146;s Rabbit Island ID number at the top of her thigh. Another man
      noted it on a clipboard, while the third man unwrapped a length of clear,
      thin tubing which was coiled inside a hygienic plastic wrapper. 
    &#147;What&#146;s that for?&#148; Kate asked nervously. The item looked
      familiar. They didn&#146;t bother to answer, and nor did she ask any more
      questions. A three inch wide strip of white surgical tape was plastered
      across her face. Large hands pressed hard on both her cheeks, pushing her
      head backwards, to ensure the tape was bonded fully with her skin. 
    When the tube was taken from the plain packaging, Kate recognized it in
      an instant: A Foley catheter. Though the plain packaging suggested to her
      that this one was an inferior far-eastern imitation.  
    She knew she was to about to be catheterized. As a nurse she&#146;d seen
    and performed this procedure many times. She&#146;d even put one on herself
    a couple of years ago. If she expected patients to do this themselves at
    home, then she figured it only right that she understood what it was like.
    And having catheterized herself she then wore a urine bag strapped to her
    leg for a whole working day on the hospital wards. Her patients may have
    admired her, it merely confirmed her colleagues&#146; earlier opinion of
    her: Cute, amusing, but slightly mad. 
     
    The man standing behind her kicked her feet apart, using his boots to
      keep them spread wide, while another man knelt down in front of her. His
      latex-gloved fingers probed the folds of her labia, exposing the opening
      of her urethra. With little regard for her pain, and none at all for her
      modesty, he eased the tube up into the small opening for several inches.
      She looked downwards, silent and wide-eyed, as he syringed a little water
      into the retaining valve that held the tube within her bladder. When that
      was done he tugged gently on the tube to test it. The balloon valve in
      her bladder held the tube securely and watertight within her. 
    Kate saw her urine trickling through the long flexible tube, emptying
      onto the grass between her feet. The catheter man taped the tube into place
      using one-inch surgical tape, encircling the top of her left thigh. A similar
      wrap of tape was applied just below her knee, and again at the ankle, just
      like fixing a drainpipe in place. Although the procedure lacked the hygiene
      standards that Kate had been taught, she could not fault the man&#146;s
      efficiency. When she glanced over at the row of thirty cocooned bodies
      she realized he&#146;d had a lot of practice. 
    The man swabbed the tears from Kate&#146;s eyes. &#147;Don&#146;t cry,&#148; he
      said, but not to comfort her; it was a direct command. He pushed her to
      the ground onto a white sheet, placed one of her ankles onto the other
      and linked them with two plastic ties. She heard that noise again: Zip,
      zip, clip, clip. So impersonal, so efficient! Her ankles were secured,
      and as with her wrists, would surely stay that way until someone decided
      to cut her free.  
    They finished by wrapping the white sheet around her, then banded her
      body in six places with strong silver-grey tape. Each band preceeded by
      a loud rip as the tape was peeled from its roll. There was no farewell
      to or from Rabbit Island as the white pillow slip was placed over her head. 
    Kate was lifted and carried to the end of the line. Dumped on the bermuda
      grass lawn, she found herself rubbing shoulders with similarly bound and
      anonymous victims. She had become a commodity. Livestock to be shipped.
      No name, no uniqueness, just another helpless female body, listed on someone&#146;s
      clipboard only by her serial number: 69. 
    Back in the courtyard, it was a further ten minutes before Jessica and
      Debbie were divested of all their pony accoutrements. They were naked and
      barefoot, free at last from all bondage, stretching and rotating their
      arms in the air in triumph, savouring their first taste of freedom. They
      hugged and smiled at each other, unable to believe the sudden turn of events.
      Two muscular men led them out of the courtyard towards the front of the
      Lodge. Only when they turned the corner to face the front lawns was the
      horror fully revealed to them. 
    This was not freedom, Jessica and Debbie realized. The ex-ponygirls though
      free from harness had the same instinctive reaction at the same moment:
      Flee! 
    They both shrugged themselves clear of their surprised escorts, and sprinted
      away, heading towards the shortcut to the beach. They were confident they
      could outrun any man.  
    The men didn&#146;t even try to keep up. They didn&#146;t need to. A hundred
      yards away Jessica and Debbie were staring down a rifle barrel five yards
      ahead of them. It was Vince, who was walking up from the beach with his
      five bunnies in tow. 
    &#147;Don&#146;t make me shoot.&#148; He said calmly, the gun barrel&#146;s
      aim alternating confidently between their chests. &#147;This baby can make
      a real big hole in you. I suggest you turn around and return to the nice
      men.&#148; 
    They stared at him with burning contempt, drilling their eyes into his,
      displaying their sense of betrayal. Vince was amused by their reaction.
      He&#146;d never been anything other than their captor&#146;s employee,
      and was never particularly kind to them. But for Jessica and Debbie, he
      was the devil they knew, which suddenly seemed a hell of a lot better than
      these new devils they didn&#146;t know. 
    &#147;Eighty-four!&#148; The man called out after locating the Rabbit
      Island ID on Jessica&#146;s thigh. She felt powerless, numb, like being
      trapped in a living nightmare, as they packaged her in the same brusque
      manner as Kate and all the others. Plastic-tied, tape-gagged, catheter-tubed,
      and bedsheet-wrapped, her processed body was laid out at the end of the
      ever-growing line.  
    All Jessica could see was a sunlit white through the pillow slip which
      had probably been on somebody&#146;s bed last night. It certainly smelled
      that way. Her shoulders rubbed those of her neighbours to each side. On
      the left she was comforted to feel Debbie&#146;s presence. She knew instinctively
      it was Debbie, just from her familiar grunts and sighs. 
    Jessica listened to the sounds around her. The feeble cries of protesting
      bunnies, and the ripping of tape ceased after Vince&#146;s five had been
      processed. She heard men milling around their captives, smoking cigarettes
      and discussing who was going where, and when, and with whom. She listened
      closely for number 84. Her number felt as much her identity as her own
      name. She never really liked Orwell&#146;s book 1984 but on Rabbit Island,
      having received her tattooed number, she developed a peculiar attachment
      to it. Sometimes, when tied up for long periods, she would fight the mind-numbing
      tedium by trying to remember scenes from the book. Eventually she had written
      her own version of it. 
    Suddenly she realized Debbie was not longer beside her. Her pony partner
      had disappeared; snatched from her side without her even noticing. Jessica
      feared they had been separated, perhaps forever. One thing she had grown
      to appreciate about ponygirl life was never being lonely, but now Jessica
      felt utterly alone, utterly helpless and fearful in a way she had never
      known before in her year on Rabbit Island. 
    Then it was her turn. Helicopters were landing nearby, the strong breeze
      of its rotors flapping the white hood against her face, which at least
      protect her from the dust storm. 
    Unseen hands lifted her, and to Jessica&#146;s surprise she was set down
      on top of another body. It was facing the other direction so Jessica&#146;s
      face rested on the woman&#146;s ankles. Webbed straps were fastened around
      them to hold the pair firmly together. Those straps were hooked on to the
      helicopter&#146;s winch. Her body jerked and Jessica knew she and her unknown
      companion were suspended in mid-air. She felt a cool sea breeze filtering
      through her thin wrapping and tried not to think of how high above the
      ground she was. 
    They were flying, suspended beneath the helicopter. Had she been able
      to see, Jessica would have had a spectacular birds-eye view of Rabbit Island
      behind her and a luxurious hundred-foot cruise ship ahead of her. Its sleek
      black hull was too large to dock at Rabbit Island&#146;s modest jetty so
      it was anchored a short distance out to sea. 
    The airlift took barely a minute. Unseen hands released the straps separating
      Jessica from her trembling companion. The all-pervading thrum of the helicopter
      faded away as it headed back to shore for its next load. When she heard
      the sound of water lapping against the boat, Jessica knew for sure that
      she was at sea. Rabbit Island didn&#146;t do day cruises for ponygirls
      last she heard. She, and indeed all the ponygirls, talked sometimes of
      their terror of being &#145;shipped&#146;. Now it had happened, and so
      far it was everything she feared it would be. 
&#147;Let&#146;s get &#145;em into storage,&#148; one of the handlers said to
another, &#147;there'll be more here in a couple of minutes.&#148; 
     
    The two men grabbed hold of her, one at the ankles the other by the tape
      wrappings just below her shoulders. For a moment she was in an upright
      position as they manhandled her down two flights of ladder-like steps. 
    &#147;She goes in bunk six,&#148; a gruff Canadian voice said. He was
      definitely not from Rabbit Island, Jessica knew that much for certain. 
    After an audible heave from the two men, Jessica landed face-down onto
      a firmly padded surface. Retaining straps were fastened across her back
      and calves. Soon after, they returned with Jessica&#146;s recent travel
      companion, fixing her in the same manner into the bunk below. 
    A knife started cutting near Jessica&#146;s neck, at the collar of strong
      tape which sealed on her white cotton hood. The hood was pulled clear. 
    &#147;Hey sweetie!&#148; The man said cheerfully as he rearranged her
      messed-up hair. Jessica craned her neck upwards in response, her eyes meeting
      his sooner than she hoped. She&#146;d forgotten to prepare her angry expression
      and instead her eyes conveyed only fear and submission. The broad swathe
      of white tape masked the lower half of her face, but the man clearly liked
      what he did see: Jessica&#146;s thick brunette hair and soulful dark eyes. 
    &#147;Ponygirl?&#148; 
    &#147;Uh-hmmm,&#148; Jessica confirmed, and not without a small amount
      of pride. She would have liked to know why he asked, but as Master Alex
      would often remind her: &#145;the gagged one doesn&#146;t ask the questions&#146;. 
    The man moved his attention to the girl in the bunk below Jessica, cutting
      away her white hood too. &#147;Cute!&#148; he said with a smile. Jessica
      could see her captor&#146;s face, but not her companion strapped into the
      bunk immediately below her. 
    Twenty minutes later the below-decks storage area was fully occupied.
      Jessica was on the topmost of three bunks. Across the narrow aisle were
      three other bunks. Jessica didn&#146;t recognize the occupants - they must
      be visitors, she guessed incorrectly. It was she who was now the visitor.  
    The same man started to cut away at the fabric near Jessica&#146;s wrists.
      Her optimism at being released was short-lived. He made no attempt to remove
      or alter the plastic ties around her wrists, he just wanted access to her
      hands. He attached metal clamps to the thumb and fingers of each hand.
      Her toes got the same treatment. They didn&#146;t hurt, but she was constantly
      aware of nip of steel crocodile teeth in her various digits. She turned
      her head to observe the woman on the opposite bunk treated similarly. She
      could see that the clamps had wires trailing from them. Wires not strong
      enough to restrain anyone but strong enough to transmits an electric current. 
    Soon all six hapless roommates were identically bound and clamped: Wrists
      and ankles fixed with plastic ties, wrapped in a white sheet and tape-bound
      and, like Jessica, they all sported a wide strip of white tape across the
      mouth. 
    Having completed the clamping of fingers and toes, the man stood at the
      end of the aisle in sight of all his passengers. Six pairs of helpless
      female eyes looked up at him.  
    &#147;Listen up ladies,&#148; he said, savouring the irony of his salutation, &#147;Soon
      we&#146;ll be setting sail, and we expect choppy seas for part of the journey.
      Enough to cause sea sickness.&#148; 
    Their eyes widened at the dreadful implication of sickness to someone
      who was gagged. 
    &#147;So, if you agree to remain quiet throughout the journey, we will
      remove your gags shortly after we heave anchor.&#148; 
    They all nodded and quietly mmmphed their agreement. Yes, we&#146;ll be
      as quiet as church mice, they would have said. 
    &#147;Remember! Not a sound after your gags are removed. This bunk space
      is wired-up for sound and we&#146;ll be listening for any noise. To the
      side of your face you&#146;ll see a straw sticking up? That&#146;s water.
      Drink plenty throughout the journey. No need to worry about peeing, we&#146;ve
      plumbed your catheter tubes into our waste system. If you need a shit,
      let me know... but I&#146;m hoping you&#146;ll manage three days without
      going.&#148; 
    He gazed with evident satisfaction at the six captives, then he left,
      climbing the steps to the middle deck. 
    Shortly afterwards two massive Volvo diesel engines fired into life, gurgling
      with latent power. The ship imperceptibly started its journey as the engines&#146; throaty
      revs increased. 
    RICCARDO 
    Riccardo stood on the deck watching the rounded green hills of Rabbit
      Island receding into the horizon. Someone handed him another glass of champagne.
      He&#146;d downed the first as if it were medicine; a bitter tasting medicine. 
    &#147;Wait till you see Isla de la Plata. It&#146;s spectacular.&#148; Said
      the man alongside him. 
    &#147;So I&#146;m told,&#148; Riccardo said coolly, his gaze still fixed
      on the ever-decreasing mass of Rabbit Island. Was he foolish to accept
      this assignment? He didn&#146;t know. He was curious to see La Plata for
      himself. To find out how they did things like ponygirl training, and how
      it compared to Rabbit Island; but primarily he was going there out of a
      sense of responsibility. He despised himself for his weakness. 
    This boat was impressive. He&#146;d never been rich but Riccardo had lived
    amongst wealthy people for many years and seen many fine things, but he&#146;d
    never been on a vessel as large and luxurious as the Silver Lady. It was
    fit for royalty, a movie star or a perhaps a Russion oil magnate. Even his
    small private berth had en-suite facilities. The captain extended an invitation
    for him to visit the bridge. He was looking forward to seeing it, always
    fascinated by the technical gadgetry that a yacht of this size possessed. 
     
    &#147;Darling. We&#146;ve prepared some delicious snacks for lunch.&#148; 
    Riccardo turned around to see the boat&#146;s owner. He had to smile.
      Her leather and high heels had been replaced by a casual cotton shirt,
      navy shorts and boat shoes. She looked almost normal. 
&#147;Thank you M...&#148; 
     
    &#147;Argenta!&#148; she interrupted, a practiced smile assembling itself
      on her face. &#147;Please call me Argenta.&#148; 
    &#147;Thank you... Argenta.&#148; 
    He followed Argenta into the lavish stateroom, resplendently decorated,
      and with the familiar scent of freshly-picked Rabbit Island orchids. The
      buffet lunch was delicious as promised. After lunch, also as promised,
      came his visit to the ship&#146;s bridge. 
    The Captain stood, legs planted firmly at shoulder width, in the centre
      of the bridge, casting an eye over the vast array of electronic displays
      and radars, whilst gazing contentedly at the open sea ahead like an old
      sea dog. Yet she was neither old, and certainly no dog. She greeted Riccardo
      warmly, having finally noticed his cautious entry into her domain. His
      couldn&#146;t hide his admiration of her equipment, though she was clearly
      used to such compliments. 
    Riccardo had always liked a woman in uniform, particularly a tight-fitting
      one like the captain&#146;s. Whilst her white uniform jacket and pants
      were normal for her rank (if somewhat formal compared to the rest of the
      ship&#146;s crew), the cut of them might be called &#145;exceedingly fine&#146;,
      hugging the perfect curves of her breasts and buttocks. He sensed that
      if one of the brass buttons on her jacket popped free, the whole thing
      would burst open with the repressed power of her stunning breasts. Yes,
      he liked that, and envied the man who would undress her at night. He wondered
      fancifully whether he may in fact be that man at some time during the next
      three days. 
    &#147;Belinda?&#148; The captain called out softly to the slim young woman
      who had been leaning over the charts with protractor and ruler. Belinda
      looked up and smiled politely. 
    &#147;This is Belinda, Silver Lady&#146;s first officer and my lover.&#148; The
      captain informed Riccardo. That final detail perhaps given to save Riccardo
      from making an awkward and pointless advance on either of them. He made
      a brave effort to conceal his disappointment. He shook hands heartily with
      Belinda who was every bit as handsome, in a pretty-female-in-tightly-buttoned-uniform
      kind of way, as her lover. They spent a half hour giving Riccardo the grand
      tour of the radar systems, the satellite navigation, and the auto pilot.
      Lesbian lovers they might be, but they seemed to enjoy his company. 
    &#147;Come up and visit us any time.&#148; They said cheerily as Riccardo
      thanked them and made his exit. He liked them, but cursed God that they
      were lesbians. Notwithstanding that, he was fairly sure he would take them
      up on their hospitality. Riccardo mused on the possibility of converting
      them. Bedding a lifelong lesbian was even better than bedding a virgin. 
    THE SIAMESE TWINS 
    Lovers they might be, but the Captain and First Officer Belinda didn&#146;t
      seem likely to provide any erotic thrills for the casual visitor while
      they were on duty. Riccardo was nonetheless confident he wouldn&#146;t
      have to look far for such things. He&#146;d been promised. 
    He returned to the main lounge and dining area to find out if the cute
      Thai serving maids he&#146;d seen at lunch had any free time. He spotted
      them, sat on the parquet floor at the feet of Argenta.  
    She saw him enter. &#147;Darling! Do sit down and talk to us. You&#146;ll
      feel seasick if you keep walking around.&#148;  
    Riccardo feared she was right, and sat a respectful distance along the
      plush salon seating from Argenta and her Thai maids. 
    &#147;You haven&#146;t introduced me,&#148; Riccardo said, gesturing with
      his handsome latin eyes towards the maids. 
    &#147;Oh yes, of course. These are my Siamese twins. I&#146;m sure they
      have other names, but why bother with names? I can&#146;t tell them apart
      anyway.&#148; Argenta laughed at her own joke, even though she&#146;d told
      it many times before. 
    Riccardo made a small wave at the smiling twins. They were truly beautiful;
      petite, but with big expressive eyes and devastating smiles. &#147;Hi twins!&#148; 
    Argenta was right, they really couldn&#146;t be told apart. They waved
      back charmingly, though Riccardo sensed they only had eyes for Argenta,
      their Mistress. 
    &#147;I was just explaining to the twins about keel-hauling.&#148; Argenta
      said, bringing Riccardo into the conversation. &#147;Any more misbehavior
      from them and they&#146;ll learn about it first-hand. Apparently if the
      sharks don&#146;t get you it&#146;s quite refreshing.&#148;  
    She laughed at her own joke again. Argenta&#146;s mantle was starting
      to slip. She leaned towards Riccardo, and lowered her voice as if to confide
      in him.&#147;The little darlings are fun to have around, but when I&#146;m
      bored of them I&#146;ll have them tied up, sealed in a weighted sack and
      dropped into the ocean.&#148; 
    The Thai maids giggled, having overheard the comment. 
    Riccardo expected to see a smile or perhaps a sly wink, but Argenta&#146;s
      face remained deadpan. 
    &#147;I&#146;ve already told them, but they think I&#146;m joking!&#148; Argenta
      added with a shrug. She indulged the giggling maids with a maternal pat
      on their heads. They adored her, worshipped her, and seemed to tingle with
      sexual excitement just from being sat at her feet. 
    Riccardo had a couple of questions for her. The first one, &#145;are there
      any females on board that aren&#146;t lesbians?&#146; he decided would
      have to wait. He opted for a simpler question: Could he visit the Rabbit
      Island girls in the storage bay? 
    &#147;Steerage, we call it.&#148; Argenta joked. &#147;Of course you may.
      Peter will take you down there later.&#148; 
    He knew Peter. A fellow pony driver, though he kept himself to himself.
      There would be plenty of time in the next few days to get to know each
      other, Riccardo thought. The other pony driver, Paul, was altogether more
      distant, and Riccardo doubted they would ever be friends. Rabbit Island
      pony drivers had a genuine camaraderie, which Riccardo assumed was shared
      by all pony drivers. Apparently it was not so.  
    IN STEERAGE, THE ELECTROCIZER 
    Peter was as good as his word, removing the tape from their faces once
      they had set sail. Jessica slurped thirstily from the conveniently placed
      straw. The water was cool and refreshing, though its taste hinted of something
      more than just water. That wasn&#146;t unusual. She&#146;d become resigned
      to being fed all manner of drugs on Rabbit Island; they were mostly beneficial
      she conceded, judging by her own assessment of her health. The drug she
      cursed most was the one that so dramatically affected her libido. It constantly
      undermined her resistance to the teasing and torments they inflicted on
      her. Sometimes even when running as a ponygirl, she had moments where she
      felt horny beyond belief, desperate to feel a man&#146;s dick pumping into
      her whilst she tugged violently against her strapping. She&#146;d never
      actually had an orgasm while rigged up as a ponygirl. Debbie, her erstwhile
      partner, coyly admitted to it on several occasions. Now, cocooned and strapped
      face-down on a bunk, an orgasm, whether self-induced, assisted or enforced,
      seemed an impossible dream. 
    Peter left them, and for a while the six occupants kept silent as they
      promised. Two or three days with only the constant drum of the marine engines
      would drive her crazy, Jessica thought. She remembered similar situations
      before where she wasn&#146;t gagged but was forbidden to speak. In the
      company of good friends such as Kate to stay silent was immensely difficult.
      It was easier to be gagged and not have the temptation. 
    The bunk area was small, consisting of little more than the two stacks
      of three narrow bunks and a two-foot aisle in between. It was just front
      of centre within the boat, and had a small frosted skylight that perfectly
      illuminated the room.  
    Jessica looked across at the woman on the opposite bunk, hoping to utilize
      her lip-reading talent. The woman was undeniably pretty, though her blonde
      hair was cut ultra short as if it had recently been shaved off. There was
      something wrong with her. Instead of relaxing, which was all one could
      really do when cocooned in the present fashion, this woman seemed to be
      tensing, grimacing, struggling with a fierce intensity. Her eyes bulged
      with panic. 
    &#147;Oh my god! She&#146;s having a seizure!&#148; Jessica blurted out.
      She raised her voice. &#147;Someone help us. There&#146;s a girl down here
      having a fit!&#148; Jessica fully expected to see Peter dashing down the
      steps into the storage bay a moment later. Surely the microphones must
      have picked up her cries for help. 
    &#147;It&#146;s okay. Amy&#146;s fine,&#148; said the black girl in the
      opposite middle bunk. &#147;It&#146;s just the Electrocizer.&#148; 
    &#147;The what?&#148; Jessica asked. 
    &#147;The Electrocizer. It sends pulses through the body to stimulate
      muscle activity. You know the clamps on your fingers and toes? That&#146;s
      how you&#146;re connected to it. Don&#146;t worry, it looks worse than
      it really is. You&#146;ll see.&#148;  
    &#147;Jessi?&#148; A voice inquired timidly from the bunk below her.  
    Jessica squealed with joy. &#147;Katie? Is that you?&#148; 
    &#147;Of course it&#146;s me. Oh God, I&#146;m so glad you&#146;re here
      Jessi!&#148; Kate&#146;s emotion overtook her as she wept, unable to speak
      another word for the next minute. Jessica soothed her with gentle words.
      There was barely a foot of space between them, yet they could neither touch
      nor even see each other. 
    &#147;Who&#146;s on the bottom bunk?&#148; Jessica called out, hoping
      against all hope that it would be Debbie. 
    &#147;It's me. Karen. Karen Galtz!&#148; Came the exasperated response. &#147;There&#146;s
      been a mistake. I shouldn&#146;t be here!&#148; 
    Jessica tried not to laugh. &#147;Me neither, Karen.&#148; Jessica had
      had little contact with the journalist since her stealthy arrival on Rabbit
      Island. Although she hadn&#146;t pieced everything together, she knew enough
      to deduce that Karen Galtz was partially responsible for their current
      plight. Karen&#146;s ill-fated journalistic snooping visit hadn&#146;t
      earned her any friends on Rabbit Island; not among the Masters or the slaves.
      Despite it all, Jessica felt sorry for her. (She had ceased feeling sorry
      for herself a long time ago.) 
    The Electrocizer was running on a preset sequence, giving the the top
      bunk&#146;s occupant around ten minutes of its stimulating shocks. Then,
      without warning, its attention, or rather its current, switched to the
      black girl in the middle bunk. Her reaction to the Electrocizer, Jessica
      noticed, was strikingly similar to that of the blonde woman. Amy was her
      name, she said, exchanging pleasantries with Jessica, whilst recovering
      her breath. Though exhausted, as if she&#146;d had a good workout, she
      didn&#146;t seem any worse for her shock treatment. 
    When the girl in the bottom bunk was receiving her dose from the Electrocizer,
      Jessica trembled and braced herself for the inevitable. Then it hit her,
      like somebody yanking on her legs, trying to dislocate her thighs from
      her pelvis. She felt a powerful uncontrollable twitching in her muscles
      as if an electric force was taking control of her body. If she were not
      so well cocooned and strapped down she imagined her arms and legs would
      be flailing around in all directions. Soon her heart was pounding, sending
      more blood to her muscles. The devilish machine had a varied repertoire,
      warming her up, stretching her, aerobically pacing her, and even massaging
      her, or so it felt. It was providing quite a work-out. 
    Riccardo arrived just in time to witness Jessica&#146;s electrically-induced
      exercise routine. 
    &#147;Don&#146;t touch her!&#148; Amy in the opposite bunk called out,
      having seen Riccardo&#146;s hand move towards Jessica&#146;s face. &#147;You&#146;ll
      get a shock.&#148; 
    Riccardo stood back. &#147;I've just had one. What the hell is happening
      to her?&#148; 
    Shona, the black girl below Amy, explained about the Electrocizer again.
      Jessica looked up at Riccardo, her eyes bulbous, popping out alarmingly,
      her mouth open like a hungry fish, trying and failing to form words or
      engaged her vocal cords. 
    &#147;Jesus Christ!&#148; He exclaimed, suffering a different kind of
      shock to Jessica. He could barely stand to look at her. He spotted Kate
      in the bunk below and bent down to to stroke her head. &#147;Hey sweetie!&#148; he
      said, perhaps too tenderly. 
    &#147;You&#146;d better not touch me. I&#146;ll get the same thing any
      moment now,&#148; Kate warned him. &#147;Damn it! I&#146;m not a ponygirl,
      I don&#146;t need to exercise like Jessica does. I never...&#148; 
    Kate was right. It was nearly her turn. While she jerked and jolted in
      her bunk, Jessica collapsed in groans of relief. 
    &#147;How are you?&#148; Riccardo asked his ponygirl, leaving a jerking,
      bug-eyed palpitating Kate to get on with her exercizes. It didn&#146;t
      seem right to watch. 
    &#147;Exhausted, Sir,&#148; Jessica replied. &#147;Completely exhausted
      by that thing. Oh my god, that was unbelievable.&#148; 
    After sipping water through her straw, Jessica said, &#147;Riccardo, Sir,
      can I ask what is happening? Why are we on this boat? Where are they taking
      us?&#148; 
    &#147;We&#146;re going to La Plata.&#148; Riccardo replied, &#147;It&#146;s
      a sex colony similar to Rabbit Island. We&#146;ll be there until all this
      fuss dies down. Rabbit Island was attracting too much attention so they&#146;ve
      shut it down for a while. With any luck we&#146;ll be back home in three
      months.&#148; 
    His choice of the word home gave Jessica mixed feelings, but she
      understood what he meant. &#147;We&#146;re on Madame Cavallo&#146;s boat,
      aren&#146;t we?&#148; she stated, almost answering her own question. She
      needed only a straight answer as confirmation. 
    Riccardo sighed. &#147;Yes we are. You&#146;ve been transferred into her
      custody while Rabbit Island is closed... and so have I. But I&#146;m still
      be in charge of you, so don&#146;t go thinking you&#146;re on holiday!&#148; 
    His black humour coaxed a equally sardonic chuckle from Jessica. If all
      she had to worry about was obeying and pleasing Riccardo the next three
      months would be tolerable. Yet she harboured an unsettling feeling it would
      not be that easy. 
    Riccardo felt awkward witnessing Kate&#146;s convulsions, as if intruding
      on something personal. He bade a quick goodbye with a promise to return
      in the morning. 
    &#147;You like your driver don&#146;t you?&#148; Amy stated. 
    &#147;I respect him,&#148; Jessica corrected her. &#147;He is a firm driver,
      but fair.&#148; 
    &#147;Peter is my driver.&#148; Amy said. &#147;He&#146;s a bastard.&#148; 
    Jessica&#146;s heart skipped a beat as she fitted the pieces of the story
      together: Peter was driving the pony trap that crashed. Amy was the ponygirl
      with a broken ankle that they took to the medical suite. It has to be her,
      because the other ponygirl was dead. 
    &#147;How&#146;s the ankle?&#148; Jessica asked. 
    &#147;It&#146;s swollen and it aches a little,&#148; Amy said stoicly, &#147;but
      I received good treatment in your medical suite. Kate&#146;s a good nurse.&#148; 
    It was all the confirmation Jessica needed. She knew she&#146;d have to
      break the sad news to Amy. 
    &#147;I wonder what happened to my partner.&#148; Amy mused, just as Jessica
      expected she would. 
    Jessica sighed. &#147;Amy, she&#146;s dead. They found her body on the
      beach. They didn&#146;t kill her, she drowned.&#148; 
    Amy went silent with shock. Jessica watched as tears gathered on Amy&#146;s
      lower eyelids before they spilled down her cheeks. 
    Jessica cursed her bondage for preventing her from giving Amy a consoling
      hug. &#147;I&#146;m cuddling you,&#148; she said softly. 
    Amy nodded, and sniffed. &#147;I know you are.&#148; 
    &#147;They buried her in a beautiful place, and removed all her bonds.
      She&#146;s free now.&#148; 
    &#147;She said she&#146;d rather die than go back to La Plata,&#148; Amy
      said with bitterness. &#147;It looks like she kept her word.&#148; 
    RICCARDO GETS A SURPRISE 
    &#147;Riccardo dear, I meant to tell you earlier, there&#146;s something
      waiting in the room next to yours.&#148; Argenta teased. 
    He went to investigate, opening the door to find two cocooned bodies squirming
      alongside each other on the single bed. They were still hooded, having
      received no attention in the many hours since their transfer to the boat.
      He dragged one, then the other, onto the open bow deck. 
    &#147;You can unwrap them, but don&#146;t untie them. We don&#146;t want
      to lose them overboard!&#148; Argenta instructed. 
    Using his pen knife he started hacking through the copious tape binding
      their bodies. With their Rabbit Island numbers written in black marker-pen
      on the white sheet he already knew which bunnies he was unwrapping. 
    Rachel was desperate to get out of her cocoon, writhing so much that Riccardo
      feared he would cut her with the blade. Only when she was fully unwrapped
      and propped up in a sitting position did he pull the tape off her face.
      With her wavy blonde hair cascading down to her breasts she looked as attractive
      as ever, apparently unharmed by her ordeal. 
    She studied the catheter tube fixed to the full length of the inside of
      her leg. It was fitted with a small clamp at mid thigh. 
    &#147;Can you remove my clamp please Sir, I&#146;m bursting!&#148; 
    Riccardo&#146;s eyes followed the tube from her slim plastic-tied ankles
      up to her knees and thighs. Seeing the tube disappearing between her pussy
      lips made his dick stir into life.. He pulled the little clamp from the
      tube on her thigh and watched the pale yellow urine flow through the tube
      and into the deck&#146;s gutter. Rachel, in blissful relief, closed her
      eyes and half-opened her mouth which only further aroused Riccardo&#146;s
      lust. 
    The other bundle was wriggling and mmmphing for attention, having heard
      Rachel&#146;s and Riccardo&#146;s conversation. He was amused, joking with
      Rachel about Mandy&#146;s excellent impersonation of an overgrown maggot.
      He&#146;d never found Mandy to his taste, but totally covered, bound up
      and making a delightful squirming movement she looked rather sexy. Reluctantly
      he cut her free of her wrappings and propped her up alongside Rachel, leaning
      against the white uPVC wall of the cabin, with their legs extended in front.
      Their ankles were still held together by plastic ties. 
    Not wishing to disturb the peace with Mandy&#146;s notoriously inane chatter
      Riccardo left her mouth taped up. Rachel, in contrast, knew how to shut
      up. For a Texan, she was pretty good at keeping quiet; she seldom said
      more than was necessary. 
    &#147;What are you going to do with them,&#148; A voice enquired from
      behind Riccardo. He didn&#146;t turn around. He knew it was Cavallo, or
      Argenta as her &#145;friends&#146; called her. 
    &#147;I thought I&#146;d feed them and make sure they&#146;re comfortable.&#148; 
    She handed him two small cartons of juice. &#147;This will do them.&#148; 
    Riccardo tore the small straws off side of the packets, popped them through
      the holes and offered them to the mouths of his girls. Not inclined to
      peel off Mandy&#146;s gag, lest she said the wrong thing to Argenta, he
      pierced the tape between her lips with the straw. They sipped urgently
      knowing that Riccardo could move the cartons away from them at any time. 
    Argenta noticed Rachel&#146;s large breasts; it was hard not to. &#147;Oh
      good, a milkmaid!&#148; she exclaimed, smiling broadly. The little steel
      hats fitted over Rachel&#146;s nipples confirmed it, though the size and
      shape of the breasts were also a strong indicator. She bent down and toyed
      with Rachel&#146;s nipple covers, pulling and twisting until Rachel winced
      with pain. &#147;How much per day?&#148; 
    &#147;Just over a litre, Ma&#146;am.&#148; Rachel responded in her soft
      Texan drawl. 
    &#147;Ever had children?&#148; 
    &#147;I had a child at sixteen.&#148; 
    &#147;Healthy?&#148; 
    &#147;Yes. I gave him up for adoption.&#148; 
    Argenta seemed pleased as she looked at Riccardo. &#147;This one can go
      into the breeding unit with sixty nine.&#148; 
    Then Argenta gave a cursory glance at Mandy, who looked rather plain alongside
      Rachel. &#147;The Domestic unit will have this one,&#148; she pronounced
      with a desultory wave. 
    RABBIT ISLAND MEMORIES 
     
    It didn&#146;t take long before the six occupants of the storage room
      were exchanging tales about their respective island homes. Kate and Jessica
      were the most forthcoming, prompted by Amy&#146;s constant questions. 
    &#147;I remember when I first arrived at the bunny cabin.&#148; Jessica
      said. It was paradise in some respects. Days on end messing around on a
      fantastic sandy beach! The eight of us got on very well, and Kate became
      my closest friend. At first it was hard, living every day in a collar and
      cuffs, but I soon got used to it. Sometimes it was fun, like the soccer
      games, and meal-times at the trough usually with a little wine in the evenings,
      and flirting with the pony drivers. Then of course there were the night
      time games!&#148; 
    &#147;Ah Jessi,&#148; Kate interrupted, &#147;but remember, after you
      left to be a ponygirl they made us wear chastity belts!&#148; 
    &#147;I didn&#146;t leave!&#148; Jessica corrected her. &#147;If you remember
      we escaped, but got recaptured. I didn&#146;t really have a choice about
      becoming a ponygirl. It was either become a ponygirl or get shipped to
      some dreadful place.&#148; 
    Amy kept quiet. La Plata, her abode for the last two years, was probably
      one the dreadful places Jessica was refering to. 
    Kate laughed as she thought of something. &#147;Jessi, do you remember
      the hunting game where we had to run and hide in the hills? They locked
      gags on us and made us wear dark goggles so it was difficult to see where
      we were going.&#148; 
    Jessica laughed. &#147;Yeah, but we outwitted them. We removed each other&#146;s
      goggles so we could see what was happening.&#148; She explained to Amy. 
    &#147;And you kicked that man in the balls, just when they thought they&#146;d
      trapped us. Oh my god, Jessi you really hurt him! Anyhow, Amy, the end
      result was that Jessica won their stupid game, and she was rewarded later
      that evening. That was when Jessica first met Master Alex.&#148; 
    &#147;That&#146;s not true,&#148; Jessica corrected her. &#147;He had
      me on the beach one evening a few days before that.&#148; 
    &#147;And because you won the hunting game you got the princess treatment
      that evening!&#148; 
    Jessica became defensive. &#147;I was kneeling in chains next to somebody&#146;s
      chair all evening. That&#146;s hardly the way to treat a princess!&#148; 
    &#147;Who&#146;s chair?&#148; Kate asked. 
    &#147;Master Alex&#146;s, as you well know!&#148; 
    &#147;And when they made me into a puppy recently, they took me to Master
      Alex&#146;s bedroom, and who did I find snuggled up under the duvet?&#148; 
    &#147;I was not snuggled up, as you put it. I was very tightly
      hog-tied and gagged, which is how that.pervert likes me!&#148; 
    &#147;He likes you any way he can get you!&#148; Kate laughed. 
    Kate&#146;s persistent teasing had touched on a sore point. There was
      a rumour that Master Alex had one favourite out of all the beauties they
      kept on Rabbit Island - a ponygirl named Jessica. 
    &#147;So what&#146;s your point, Katie?&#148; Jessica asked irritably.
      She hated to be teased. 
    &#147;My point, Jessi, is that he&#146;ll want you back. I&#146;ll bet
      you anything.&#148; 
    Jessica gave out a grunting, straining sound, pretending to struggle. &#147;I&#146;ve
      just checked my pockets and I don&#146;t have any money, all I have is
      my nipple and labia rings.&#148; 
    &#147;All right then.&#148; Kate said decisively. &#147; I&#146;ll bet
      you two nipple rings.&#148; 
    THE BOWSPRIT 
    Everybody had come onto the bow to watch as Rachel was secured to a sturdy
      aluminium pole. Its shape and built-in fixing points indicated that it
      was made for a specific purpose. Pulley wires were clipped to the ends
      of Rachel&#146;s pole. A motor winch whirred and the slack wire disappeared
      through a hole in the deck. The men lifted Rachel and held her over the
      bowsprit until she was dangling beneath it, several feet above the ocean&#146;s
      gentle swell. The wires continued to disappear down their respective channels
      until Rachel&#146;s naked body was fixed to the boat&#146;s prow like a
      figurehead, the ocean swelling onto her body, sometimes dousing her face
      in salty water. Above her, men, including Riccardo, swigged beer whilst
      savouring her watery terror. 
    Mandy did not escape their attention either, at least not a first. She
      was bent over the railing at the stern, her ankles secured a stride apart,
      her wrists remained plastic-tied behind her back. Her life had never been
      so simple; for the rest of the day she was nothing but a receptacle for
      men&#146;s sperm. To be used if they wished, to be ignored otherwise. With
      only three men on board she was ignored for hours at a time. 
    Meanwhile, one-hundred feet away at the front of the boat, Rachel had
      noticed small fins breaking the surface of the water in the distance. They
      seemed to be making rapidly towards her. The pitching of the bow was making
      her physically sick, the kind of sickness that makes you just want to curl
      up and die... except she couldn&#146;t, not unless the sharks got her.
      Pale grey shapes appeared beneath the water, moving rapidly, one on each
      side of her. With startling speed they broke the surface in perfect synchronization,
      their bodies forming a graceful arch either side of Rachel&#146;s shoulders.  
    She screamed with delight as the dolphins did it again, looking her in
      the eye as they hit the zenith of their leaps. They surfed the ship&#146;s
      bow wave, sometimes racing ahead, often criss-crossing each other&#146;s
      path, or gliding effortlessly on their backs as if showing off. They even
      nuzzled the soles of Rachel&#146;s feet, perhaps to comfort her, she thought.
      If only they could bite through the straps fixing her body to the ship,
      she would gladly swim away and live with them forever! 
    When darkness fell they hauled Rachel onto the deck, detaching her from
      the metal frame. They left her, still bound hand and foot with the plastic
      ties she&#146;d worn since Rabbit Island.  
    &#147;I don&#146;t want that smelly wet thing brought inside!&#148; Argenta
      stated, wrinkling her nose up at the bedraggled blonde dripping sea water
      onto her shining white deck.  
    That suited Rachel just fine. She slept on the bow deck, dreaming of dolphins.

        Chapter 15. Arrival and Processing on La Plata 
        (Even Ponygirls Sometimes Get the Blues, Aurelius &#169; 2004) 
       
      The story so far:  
        (Ch. 13) The posse camp overnight at the beach - the ponygirls are branded
          - a tragic discovery. 
        (Ch. 14) Rabbit Island is evacuated - bundled and shipped. 
      DOUBLE TROUBLE 
      The math wasn&#146;t difficult. Riccardo calculated that three days
        at sea at a constant eighteen knots meant that La Isla de la Plata was
        a thousand miles from Rabbit Island. That four-figure distance made it
        seem a long way away. On the final morning on board it wasn&#146;t the
        only cause of Riccardo&#146;s depression. 
      The night before, their third night at sea, he received an unexpected
        and truly delicious bonus. Waiting for him in his single-berthed room
        were the Siamese twins. Throughout the journey Riccardo was often to
        be found leaning on the top deck&#146;s balustrade staring out to the
        horizon, a bottle of beer held loosely in his hand. It seemed that Madame
        Cavallo felt sorry for him, or was it that she felt he was getting too
        close to Rachel and Mandy, his former charges from Rabbit Island? Whatever
        the reason for her gift, Riccardo wasn&#146;t complaining.  
      The Siamese twins were naked, standing side-by-side, backs to the wall.
        Each was fixed in handcuffs clipped to securing rings high up on the
        bulkhead. Their ankles were also restrained, slim enough to sport regular
        handcuffs. Around their delicate necks each wore a thin silver chain
        threaded with a handcuff key nestled perfectly between their breasts.
        Those perfect mounds of flesh were conspicuous for being the only part
        of their bodies that were not skinny. They had been surgically enhanced,
        that much was obvious, but it didn&#146;t detract from Riccardo&#146;s
        lustful admiration for the gifts attached to his bedroom wall. 
      Riccardo cast his eyes slowly up and down their identical bodies on
        the pretext of looking for any difference between them, but no matter
        how closely he looked no difference could be found. They were perfect
        - if you like petite Asian girls with unnaturally large breasts, with
        smiles that can melt a heart at ten paces. 
      During his inspection those seductive smiles didn&#146;t desert them
        for a moment. Riccardo had amused himself with the notion that these
        twins were not really women at all; they were living sex toys. A few
        decades from now, when Sony or Honda or whoever produces household robots,
        this is what some of them will look like... or at least the ones owned
        by single men. In the future, when women view men as obsolete in terms
        of reproduction, men with toys like these might view women as obsolete
        in everything but reproduction. But Riccardo, if he lived that
        long, would still prefer a real blonde with a real character. 
      &#147;Who chained you up?&#148; Riccardo asked them, curious to know
        who else had been in his room. 
      &#147;We did, Sir. Our Mistress told us to spend the night in your room.
        That&#146;s if you want us, Sir?&#148; they said with eyes cast downward
        in what appeared to be genuine humility. They&#146;d done a good job
        of self-bondage; their hands fixed so high their bare feet could only
        just stay flat upon the parquet floor. There was no doubting the tightness
        of the cuffs either. Had a lot of practice, Riccardo suspected. 
      &#147;It would be impolite to refuse your Mistress&#146;s gift.&#148; Riccardo
        conceded graciously. The girls giggled, as they habitually did at anything
        resembling a joke. They&#146;d noticed the way he&#146;d been staring
        at them for the last couple of days. The Silver Lady was more likely
        to strike an iceberg than Riccardo was to turf them out of his room. 
      One of many good things about these slim five-foot-nothing Asian girls
        is how little space they take up, excepting their breasts jutting out
        into the small room. If it wasn&#146;t for the pleasant sensation of
        a building hard-on filling his pants, Riccardo could have happily left
        them like that as ornaments like erotic walling hangings. But after two
        days of seasickness and celibacy is wasn&#146;t likely.  
      He lifted the key chain from around the neck of one of them. It seemed
        unfair, but he was thinking of taking one of them bed and leaving the
        other chained to the wall for the night. That was often the problem with
        having a slave-girl for the night - you want to feel the heady power
        of having her chained to the wall while you sleep, yet you also want
        her warm squirming body cuddled up in bed with you. Tonight would be
        the best of both worlds, Riccardo thought. 
      He tried to unlock the first set of handcuffs. With his body pressed
        against the girl&#146;s as he tried to unlock her, she was squirming
        in pleasure, her handcuffed ankles twisting and tugging against their
        metal bracelets seeking to relieve the delicious itch between her thighs. 
      Alas, the simple handcuff lock proved surprisingly stubborn. Riccardo
        assumed that it was the wrong key; they&#146;d obviously got their keys
        mixed up. He tried the key in the other twin&#146;s handcuffs. It turned
        and released as easily as he would expect. Riccardo took that girl&#146;s
        key chain from around her neck, expecting the key to reciprocate with
        the other&#146;s handcuffs&#133; It didn&#146;t! However it did fit her
        ankles&#146; cuffs. 
      That left him with one twin left standing chained to the wall and the
        other free, except that she had to hop around with her ankles cuffed
        together. &#147;You don&#146;t have any more keys?&#148; Riccardo asked
        more in hope than expectation. They shook their heads, as disappointed
        as he was. It was no accident. He was the victim of more game playing,
        yet this would prove only a mild inconvenience to his night of lust. 
      &#147;Warm up your sister for me,&#148; Riccardo commanded the free
        girl as he disappeared into his compact bathroom to undress and brush
        his teeth. &#147;Lots of tongue!&#148; he added. 
      When he emerged five minutes later, naked, refreshed and ready for love,
        the wall-chained twin was well on her way to orgasm, eyes closed, mouth
        open, her head swishing from side to side in reaction to her sister&#146;s
        The biggest challenge for the kneeling sister was how to keep her in
        a heightened state of readiness for their Master&#146;s arrival. Her
        mouth switched greedily from pussy to penis as soon as Riccardo was within
        her reach. While the kneeling twin attended to his penis, he pressed
        his mouth to the standing twin, grabbing her softball-sized breasts.
        She liked that, just as Riccardo loved what her kneeling sister&#146;s
        mouth was doing to his cock.  
      He&#146;d seldom ever moaned out load during foreplay, but this was
        one of those times. In spite of the immense fellatial pleasure he was
        receiving he still preferred to climax within the tight folds of a woman&#146;s
        sex, at least for the first ejaculation of the night. Having to arch
        his back just to kiss the girl, he realized their height differential
        needed resolving. The solution was kneeling right in front of him. 
      &#147;Lie flat on the floor,&#148; he instructed her breathlessly. &#147;Under
        your sister&#146;s feet.&#148; 
      With the problem solved, Riccardo rammed his cock into the standing
        twin. Thanks to her sister&#146;s body beneath her, she was perfectly
        positioned to enjoy Riccardo&#146;s violent thrusts that brought him
        to a climax. 
      Sated, Riccardo crashed out onto the bed instructing the twins to stay
        as they were. The one lying belly-down on the floor was receiving a spine-cracking
        foot massage from her sister. Each crack of her spine made him wince
        yet it was undeniably sexy too. When there were no further cracks to
        be had he instructed the kneeling one to lick her sister clean, having
        noticed his cum trickling down her thigh. 
      The free one (except for her cuffed ankles) stood up, wiped her mouth
        with the back of her hand and hopped to a small shelf to retrieve a bottle
        of wine for Riccardo. The ship was well stocked with the small plastic
        bottles usually found on airlines. She poured a glass for him.  
      Snuggling up against him while he sat legs outstretched on the bed,
        she soon had Riccardo perked up enough to consider another round. So
        far this evening she&#146;d merely been a service provider for her sister
        and Riccardo, first with her mouth, then by acting as a human footstool
        to assist Riccardo and her sister to fuck against the wall. It wasn&#146;t
        that she was jealous; simply a matter of equality, and now it was her
        turn! She moved to the foot of the bed crossed her handcuffed ankles
        and spread her knees to create a wide opening between her legs. Then
        she lifted Riccardo&#146;s ankles between them. Riccardo sipped his wine
        as she shuffled up the bed; his legs encircled by hers, her tight pussy
        moving closer and closer to his cock. It was a mutually delightful ensnarement.
        She wanted him badly, using every trick to get his cock to the desired
        size and rigidity. Witnessing the astonishing lust on this sweet girl&#146;s
        face as he squeezed her breasts brought Riccardo&#146;s cock to prompt
        attention. Quite assertive for a petite Asian girl, Riccardo observed,
        perhaps she doesn&#146;t get a real man&#146;s cock very often!. 
      A MORNING STIFFY 
      Riccardo awoke from a heavy sleep. His cabin was bright, even though
        lit only by a small porthole. The twins were gone as he expected they
        would be, knowing they had breakfast service to attend to. He turned
        over in bed for a luxurious final five minutes, enough time to savour
        the memory of previous night&#146;s fun with the twins. 
      Those sexy thoughts soon brought on the start of a pleasant morning
        erection. He reached a hand under the duvet towards his cock. It made
        contact with something harder that he imagined. Hard, like thick plastic.
        He threw off the light duvet cover; confused and curious. 
      He didn&#146;t know whether to laugh or cry. His semi-flaccid penis
        was encased in a similarly shaped device made of a clear acrylic. A ring
        of the same material encircled the root of his cock behind his scrotal
        sac. The two pieces were joined at the top of his penis with a neat padlock.
        A few exploratory tugs and twists confirmed his suspicion: It wasn&#146;t
        a toy. Any kind of erection was impossible. Despite its secure fixing,
        it was fairly comfortable except for a slight pinching behind his balls.
        That&#146;s what worried him; it was comfortable enough for long-term
        use. 
      Not knowing whether to be laugh or cry, he got up, went to the bathroom
        and pissed. It was easy enough, and thanks to the various holes in the
        plastic, sanitary as well. The only thing it prevented was erections. 
      He pulled on his pants and headed for breakfast, wondering what forfeit
        he would shortly be performing in order to have the chastity device removed.
        Perhaps he might be required to give cunnilingus on the captain, he mused
        rather hopefully. 
      Madame Cavallo looked up from her fresh fruit salad. Her smile said
        it all - superior and smug, almost laughing through those thin lips of
        hers. 
      &#147;Welcome to your first day in my employment, Riccardo. You might
        have noticed we have some special rules of our own.&#148; 
      Riccardo remained nonchalant. He wasn&#146;t going to lower himself
        to ask or beg for the device&#146;s removal knowing that the padlock
        would yield to a hacksaw in seconds. 
      &#147;You&#146;re upset because Rabbit Island insisted you were chained
        to your bed every night?&#148; Riccardo suggested. The rule affected
        all female visitor and residents on the island, with absolutely no exceptions. 
      &#147;Upset doesn&#146;t begin to describe that insult!&#148; She spat
        out, bitter at the memory of her humiliating bondage. &#147;But to answer
        your question, no it&#146;s not because of that. It&#146;s our policy.
        Same applies to Peter and Paul here.&#148; 
      Peter and Paul looked up sheepishly from their breakfast. Peter gave
        a resigned shrug. &#147;Rules are rules,&#148; he stated with unarguable
        logic as he scooped up another spoonful of cornflakes. 
      ARRIVAL AT LA PLATA 
      The dramatic yet peculiarly ugly peaks of Isla de la Plata loomed on
        the horizon whilst Riccardo sat down to breakfast, served by two embarrassed
        twins who dared not look at him. They even served him at a cautious long
        arm&#146;s length. He&#146;d figured it out. They must have spiked his
        wine and fitted the chastity device on him themselves. That&#146;s what
        you call giving something to remember them by! 
      Below decks Jessica, Kate, Karen and the three others in steerage hadn&#146;t
        moved or been fed for three days. The last twenty-four hours had passed
        by in a half-conscious stupor, interrupted only by the insistent muscle
        toning sessions of the Electrocizer. Voices from the deck above, and
        the general busyness of footsteps, caused them to sense that their destination
        was at hand. 
      Riccardo leant on the hardwood balustrade and stared at the imposing
        island getting ever closer. He was surprised to find something so grey
        and misty on a bright sunny morning in a tropical sea. 
      &#147;The mist usually burns off by mid-day,&#148; Peter explained.
        He pointed out the harbour where they were heading - a small assemblage
        of industrial buildings and loading cranes that looked minuscule compared
        to the precipitous grey mountains looming behind them. 
      Jessica and Kate said hurried goodbyes as they heard two pairs of feet
        heading down the steps into their storeroom. Nearly three days tied belly-down
        on a bunk with nothing to eat, wasn&#146;t fun but the company was very
        fine indeed. They&#146;d made new friends and learned a lot about each
        other, and perhaps too much about La Plata. None of it was good. 
      While Paul taped up her mouth, Peter removed the clips from Jessica&#146;s
        fingers and toes. Though the shocks from the Electrocizer were not exactly
        enjoyable they created a routine to the day, and she had to admit that
        the treatment really did stimulate the muscles. She was curious to see
        how she felt when they finally got around to freeing her from the unyielding
        plastic ties on her wrists and ankles. 
      Just as Jessica was first into the boat, they were preparing her to
        be the first out. Jessica remembered how the two men struggled to carry
        her down the steps into the bowels of Cavallo&#146;s boat and worried
        about how they would ever manage to lift her out. The answer came from
        above. Literally. 
      Peter levered open the small skylight that provided the room&#146;s
        source of daylight. It was just about wide enough for a man&#146;s shoulders.
        A monstrous iron hook and winching block descended slowly and silently
        into the opening. Peter strapped a padded leather band around Jessica&#146;s
        ankles. It had a couple of heavy iron rings built into it, one in front,
        and one in back. He slipped the iron hook into the front ring. 
      Without any apparent signal, the hook rose smoothly and silently upwards,
        lifting Jessica with it. Peter guided her body through the opening, careful
        to avoid damaging the living merchandise. 
      Jessica&#146;s first glimpse of La Plata was like that of most new arrivals
        - upside down. The crane&#146;s stevedore, who had been standing outside
        next to the opening (his hand signals guiding the crane&#146;s movements)
        wished her a sarcastic welcome as she rose up above him and clear of
        the Silver Lady. 
      Thirty feet in the air, suspended by her well-secured ankles, Jessica
        thought this must have been how Houdini felt as he did his notorious
        escapes, except for her there was no escape. 
      She was gliding towards a loading bay on the second floor of an old
        brick-built warehouse, a relic from a different age. The age of mining.
        A heavily built man was there to grab her as she hung above ledge of
        the loading bay. She was lifted off the crane's hook but straight onto
        another one. This one was attached to an overhead rail bolted to the
        high ceiling. The man pushed against her body, moving her along the rail
        like a carcass in an abattoir. Still wrapped and taped in a white sheet
        there was little about Jessica for him to admire. Naked bodies were much
        more interesting... like those of Mandy and Rachel who were already hanging
        from the rail when Jessica joined them. As she viewed their red blotchy
        skin Jessica realized they&#146;d had a far more eventfully couple of
        days on the boat than she. 
      The three acknowledged each other as best they could with taped up mouths,
        until the miserable man turned around and yelled &#147;shut up, bitches!&#148; He
        was looking out of the loading hatch waiting for the other five items
        on listed on his clipboard (Jessica&#146;s recent roommates) and didn&#146;t
        care for the noise of incomprehensible conversation from the tape-gagged
        consignment. 
      Mandy was crying, which was not unusual, whilst Rachel was silent though
        visibly trembling, her long blonde hair trailing forlornly on the floor.
        Kate arrived next in the room next, looking absolutely terrified. Jessica
        remembered how Kate hated heights. Dangling upside-down twenty-feet off
        the ground whilst being transported between a ship and a warehouse, compounded
        with a journey to an unknown and fearsome future had filled her eyes
        with a mad panic Jessica had never seen in her friend before.  
      Though shoulder-to-shoulder there was no comfort to give each other
        either physically or emotionally. Despite Amy&#146;s earlier attempts
        to explain what would happen to them, it still felt like their world
        was about to end. For Jessica the feeling of being an animal in an abattoir
        persisted. If men wearing heavily bloodstained white coats entered the
        room she would not have been in the least surprised. 
      Next to arrive from the ship was the instantly recognisable bald head
        of Karen Galtz followed by La Plata&#146;s returning ponygirls, Amy,
        Terri and Shona. The warehouseman inspected the inventory one by one,
        his bulging crotch at the same level as their taped-up mouths. With his
        inventory complete and in good order the man pulled up the standing flap
        of the loading door, cutting them off from the outside world. He left
        the room muttering something about &#145;lunch-time&#146;. 
      *** 
      More than an hour elapsed before anyone attended to the eight silent
        upside-down figures swaying gently on the rail. The only sound to be
        heard was their heavy nasal breathing. 
      Finally somebody arrived. It was Madame Cavallo and two assistants.
        They were in jovial mood, and appeared well fed and refreshed. 
      Amy, Terri and Shona were dispatched to their stables. One of the assistants
        pulled them along the overhead rail system, and one by one, with a motor
        whirring loudly, they disappeared out of a loading door. 
      &#147;These are the five bunnies loaned to us while Rabbit Island is
        closed.&#148; Cavallo explained to her assistants. &#147;Of course we
        have to return them when Rabbit Island reopens, though I seriously doubt
        it will happen for quite a while, perhaps not ever!&#148; 
      Her snippet of information was aimed as much at the five bunnies as
        it was her sidekicks. Cavallo didn&#146;t seem particularly sad at the
        thought of Rabbit Island&#146;s demise, but Jessica did. 
      &#147;You! Stop snivelling!&#148; Cavallo shouted at Mandy, who was
        bringing attention to herself with her constant sobs. Cavallo consulted
        a clipboard and announced the respective fates awaiting her guests.  
      &#147;These two,&#148; she announced, pointing to Rachel and Kate, &#147;are
        going to the Breeding unit.&#148; 
      &#147;The cry baby and baldy,&#148; she said, referring to Mandy and
        Karen Galtz, &#147;will be put to work in the Domestic unit.&#148; 
      &#147;And finally, having suffered a careless loss of a ponygirl on
        Rabbit Island, which was entirely due to their negligence, we have this
        one as a replacement. She&#146;s not up to the standard of our own ponygirls
        but she&#146;ll do.&#148; 
      Jessica mmmphed at them from behind her taped mouth, angry at Cavallo&#146;s
        low opinion of her, as well as the blatant lie concerning the cause of
        the ponygirl&#146;s death. 
      &#147;She&#146;s a brunette,&#148; one of the assistants said, pointing
        out the patently obvious. &#147;We can&#146;t have a dark tail with the
        blonde ponygirls.&#148; 
      The other assistant agreed. It was, after all, Cavallo&#146;s ruling
        that the ponygirl teams should be strictly segregated by race and hair
        colour. She looked at Rachel&#146;s long blonde hair, notable for being
        the only one of the five upside-down captives whose hair reached all
        the way to the floor.  
      &#147;Perhaps this one would be kind enough to donate hers?&#148; she
        suggested with a smug grin, bunching Rachel&#146;s loose hair in her
        hand and pulling upwards until she had tilted Rachel&#146;s head. &#147;Get
        the scissors, Brenda!&#148; 
      It must have been Jessica&#146;s upside-down viewpoint, but until then
        she thought Brenda, with her short blonde hair, her overweight frame
        stuffed into denim dungarees and white tee-sheet, was a man. The other
        assistant, though similarly attired, at least had the approximate shape
        of a woman. 
      Brenda promptly obliged Cavallo&#146;s request, pulling a large pair
        scissors from one of her many pockets. She knelt down and started crudely
        cutting away at Rachel&#146;s glorious blonde locks. It&#146;s easy task
        when your client is hanging upside-down, and barely half a minute later
        Rachel&#146;s crude haircut was complete. Brenda knotted the eighteen-inch
        hank of hair and handed it to her boss. 
      &#147;Thank you Brenda,&#148; Cavallo said, swishing the hair across
        Rachel&#146;s tape-gagged face, tickling her nostrils in giving her a
        chance to say a final goodbye to her crowning glory. 
      Then it was Jessica&#146;s turn. Brenda knelt down, bunched Jessica&#146;s
        hair in her fist and pulled down hard, as if trying to yank the hair
        from Jessica&#146;s scalp. Jessica whimpered as she felt the tension
        gradually ease as her hair was cut off. 
      Brenda showed Cavallo the hank of Jessica&#146;s hair in her fist, unsure
        whether it was long enough to make a good ponytail. They reluctantly
        admitted it was better than nothing. After all she wouldn&#146;t be joining
        the blonde team until she&#146;d completed her trials. 
      Kate was not so fortunate. Her blonde hair, being rather fine and barely
        shoulder length was discarded onto the floor, to be swept up and thown
        out with the garbage. Neither did Mandy&#146;s hair make the grade. Cavallo
        detected her visitors were a little upset with their new hairstyles.
        The fifth, Karen Galtz, having had her head shaved on Rabbit Island a
        few days previously seemed unperturbed; glad that she would not look
        so conspicuous from now on. 
      The scissors were immediately back in use, this time Brenda was cutting
        through the tape and white sheets which had cocooned Jessica, Kate and
        Karen for the last three days. Jessica was sorry to see her travelling
        outfit cut from her. Helpless and covered seemed less vulnerable than
        helpless and naked. Cavallo screwed up her nose as the unpleasant odor
        coming from the unwrapped bodies. 
      &#147;What about their catheter tubes?&#148; Brenda asked. Her scissors
        were poised to cut the tape encircling Jessica&#146;s left thigh which
        held the tube in place. She took a few moments to run her fingers up
        and down the inside of Jessica&#146;s legs, whilst waiting for Cavallo&#146;s
        answer. 
      The lean well-defined quadriceps of Jessica&#146;s thighs did not escape
        Brenda&#146;s notice and admiration; nor did the eight rings pierced
        through Jessica&#146;s thick and inviting labia. 
      &#147;Leave the tubes in. It won&#146;t hurt them for a couple more
        hours.&#148; Cavallo answered, not that it would worry her if it did. 
      A machine whirred to life, the wire on the overhead rail went taut,
        and with a sudden jolt Karen and Mandy were gliding out of the room,
        their bodies swung slightly in recoil, heading towards their new lives
        of domestic servitude. 
      Kate and Rachel were also despatched along a rail which disappeared
        through a door in a different direction. They would soon be installed
        in the Breeding Unit. 
      Only Jessica remained; alone with Madame Cavallo. It was almost as if
        the woman had planned it that way. Yes, there was butch Brenda and her
        mean-spirited junior, but they seemed to disappear into the walls, as
        Cavallo confronted Jessica from two yards away. Her eyes were level with
        Jessica&#146;s sex, but she much preferred looking down towards Jessica&#146;s
        upside-down face. 
      &#147;How do you like my island so far?&#148; Cavallo enquired with
        a sneer. Jessica&#146;s mouth was still taped, so she shook her head,
        closing her eyes as she breathed rapidly through her slightly blocked
        nose. 
      &#147;You&#146;re afraid, aren&#146;t you?&#148; Cavallo said with obvious
        pleasure. &#147;Is it because you&#146;ve nobody to protect you now?&#148; 
      Jessica hung motionless, not moving her head nor opening her eyes. Cavallo
        was content to continue her monologue. 
      &#147;All you have to do is be a good hard-working pony. Stay out of
        trouble, and you and I will get along fine. You can forget about dressing
        up for fancy evenings in a ballroom, like on Rabbit Island. Here we treat
        ponies like ponies. It&#146;s simpler that way. Don&#146;t you agree?
        We won&#146;t confuse your poor little ponygirl brain, like Master Alex
        did. He&#146;s a wicked man you know, playing with your emotions in the
        way he did.&#148; 
      Jessica wondered if Cavallo was right. How foolish it was to have an
        emotional attachment to a man who had enslaved her! Cavallo had upset
        her but she reined in her emotions. She promised herself she would cry
        later that night, when the lights were out and everybody was sleeping. 
      Cavallo&#146;s pause indicated she&#146;d said what she wanted to say.
        It was the most she&#146;d said to a ponygirl for a long time! &#147;I
        could stay and talk to you all day, but we&#146;ve both so much to do,
        you and me. It&#146;s time for you to join our stables, but not before
        our staff carry out a few necessary modifications. Bye-bye Jessica!&#148; 
      Cavallo nodded towards butch Brenda who was stood by a wall-mounted
        control panel. On Cavallo&#146;s command she pressed a big green safety
        button. The overhead rail juddered, causing Jessica&#146;s upside-down
        body to swing as she was sent on her way. Cavallo immediately turned
        her back, leaving the dispatch room even before Jessica had reached her
        own exit point. 
      Suddenly Jessica emerged into bright sunlight, suspended ten metres
        off the ground by a wire that led towards a dark shadowy hole in an adjacent
        building. It was an old brick-built warehouse similar the one she had
        just exited. About half-way across, Jessica heard a noise, a distinctive
        clatter of hooves coming from below her. Passing directly beneath her
        along a paved road was a ponygirl foursome pulling a trailer laden with
        large boxes. Jessica strained for a final look at the two-by-two arrangement
        of ponygirls as she entered the dark hole of her next destination. Perhaps
        that&#146;s my fate too, she thought desparingly, just an anonymous rubber-helmeted
        ponygirl spending each day hauling stuff around an unfriendly island! 
      DENTAL WORK 
      Jessica&#146;s overhead cable soon brought her into a brightly-lit white-tiled
        toom. It was a disturbing hybrid, part operating theatre part torture
        chamber. A man and woman were laughing at a shared joke as Jessica glided
        up to them. 
      Having not quite recovered from whatever it was they found so funny,
        they unhooked their latest arrival from her overhead wire. Between the
        two of them they carried her to a reclining examination chair. As Jessica
        sat with her hands still fixed behind her back the nurse fastened a heavy
        leather strap across her chest, holding her perspiring skin firmly against
        the leather padding of the chair. 
      Her bound legs were resting between two gyno stirrups, so Jessica knew
        that the plastic ties which had connected her ankles for the last three
        days would soon be removed. The doctor, or so the man appeared to be
        in his white smock, used a curved-edge wire cutters to snip easily through
        the plastic around her ankles. How annoying that something as flimsy
        as those plastic ties could contain her so absolutely! He placed her
        lifeless legs in the stirrups, pulling leathers straps around each ankle. 
      Jessica&#146;s dark eyes flitted between the doctor and the nurse looking
        for some kind of communication. They didn&#146;t return her gaze, but
        nor did they avoid looking at her. She was of no importance to them;
        they had work to do - and her body was it. The doctor and the nurse divided
        their tasks, she attending to the top half, and he to Jessica&#146;s
        lower half. How appropriate, Jessica thought cynically. 
      A high pitched buzz filled the air behind Jessica&#146;s head. At first
        she thought it sounded like a vibrator, but it was the nurse holding
        it, not the doctor. The nurse ran the electric hair clippers over Jessica&#146;s
        scalp as if she were a new army recruit. A minute later Jessica&#146;s
        hair was everywhere but on her scalp. Scattered clippings of Jessica&#146;s
        dark hair rested lightly tickling on her breasts.  
      Meanwhile the doctor attended to her catheter, lubricating and cleaning
        the moist area between Jessica&#146;s labia in preparation for its removal.
        He syringed the small amount of water from the retaining bulb then gently...
        very slowly... began pulling it from her bladder. Jessica cried into
        her taped gag, but the nurse&#146;s hands held her head steady. Jessica
        sighed with genuine relief, almost gratitude, as the tube came free. 
      The doctor lobbed the tube in a wastebin, discarding his latex gloves
        with it. He looked up at Jessica&#146;s bald head and smiled at his nurse,
        complementing her on a good job. The nurse ran her palms and fingertips
        over Jessica&#146;s scalp, almost like a shiatsu massage. She liked the
        feel of a freshly shorn scalp, feeling the tiny prickles of hair on her
        fingertips, mingled with the fresh indignity of her unwilling customer. 
      The doctor regloved and watched as the nurse carefully ran a razor over
        Jessica&#146;s scalp. He cast a mock-sympathetic glance at his patient.
        He smiled. Jessica didn&#146;t know it, but the smile carried a degree
        of admiration. Some women looked ugly with their head shaved, but Jessica,
        with shapely eyebrows and passionate dark eyes still looked quite sexy,
        the doctor thought. 
      Jessica watched the doctor warily as her shaving continued. He held
        pliers, more like bolt cutters, in one hand while his other hand rested
        near her pussy. He grimaced slightly each time he squeezed the pliers.
        One by one he clipped off and removed Jessica&#146;s labia rings, placing
        them carefully in a small bowl. They were gold, he informed his nurse.
        He&#146;d melt them down later that evening. 
      The nurse spotted the doctor&#146;s expression. &#147;Are you gonna
        give it to her?&#148; she asked coyly, whilst rubbing a lotion into Jessica&#146;s
        scalp. 
      The doctor&#146;s gaze was fixed on Jessica&#146;s invitingly open sex. &#147;Yes,
        I think I will. It would be a shame to pass up the opportunity. As his
        finger tips brushed her inner thighs he noticed an unvoluntary squirming
        from his tightly restrained patient. Whether it was fear or arousal on
        Jessica&#146;s part, the effect was the same for the doctor, his erect
        penis straining in his pants just inches away from its ultimate goal. 
      The nurse leaned forward to place her hands onto Jessica&#146;s breasts,
        causing her own breasts to press against Jessica&#146;s head. She fingered
        Jessica&#146;s nipple rings, while the doctor dropped his pants. Jessica&#146;s
        eyes widened, her pupils dilating as she realized what was coming. 
      &#147;You look like you&#146;ve never seen a penis before!&#148; the
        doctor joked as he pressed his erect member against her. &#147;Enjoy
        it baby, this&#146;ll be the last cock inside you for a long while!&#148; After
        watching him don and discard two pairs of latex gloves it came as no
        surprise to Jessica that he should sheath his cock in a condom. 
      He pushed easily into her. Jessica&#146;s inclined chair proving as
        suitable for sex as it was for medical procedures. The tape gag on Jessica&#146;s
        face barely stifled her moans as the man fucked her. The nurse leant
        over, her smock pressing against Jessica&#146;s bald scalp as she massaged
        her breasts, giggling all the while. All Jessica could do was take comfort
        from her rapist doctor&#146;s comment that it would be her last fuck
        for a while. 
      PONY DENTAL WORK 
      All Jessica could remember was the nurse placing a gas mask over her
        face, like the one time when she had dental work as a child. When she
        came to, her mouth was numb and swollen, the pain was barely repressed
        by the remains of the anathesthetic.  
      The doctor seemed happy as he cleared away his implements. Putting a
        patient under and removing two back teeth needed effort and concentration.
        He&#146;d done it before, many times, but never took the operation lightly.
        Bonding the steel bit across the mouth, where the teeth had been, was
        a simple procedure, though the double piercing of Jessica&#146;s tongue
        had been messy.  
      A human tongue was a remarkably good healer, so he wasn&#146;t overly
        concerned about a bit of swelling and bruising. With a screw-threaded
        protrusion rising up through the center of her tongue, Jessica&#146;s
        mouth and its tongue-bit would be ready for use in a few days, though
        on La Plata they seldom worried about healing times. 
      At least her labial didn&#146;t require any modification. The two central
        piercings were mature and well situated in her flesh. The doctor pulled
        and stretched out her flaps of flesh between his finger and pushed the
        U-shaped staple of a padlock through one labia and then the other. The
        padlock closed with a firm click. Jessica groggily looked down to see
        what had caused the coolness against her tender flesh. Compared to the
        pain in her mouth, her locked-up pussy didn&#146;t worry her. It had
        been a long time since she had thought of it as her own. 
      Jessica&#146;s feet were fixed together with the familiar hoisting straps.
        The doctor and nurse wheeled her chair towards the overhead pulley system
        which had earlier delivered her to them. The doctor heaved on a pulley
        and Jessica&#146;s feet lifted high into the air until she was dangling
        upside-down yet again, but this was to be her final journey. 
      Her new home and her new ponygirl life were waiting at the end of the
        line. 
      THE STABLES 
      On this final cableway journey, Jessica didn&#146;t even notice the
        teams of ponygirls passing twenty feet beneath her, dutifully pulling
        their laden wagons across time worn cobble stones. Nor did she notice
        the long low shed with its corrugated plastic roof. This crude building,
        almost a hundred metres in length, was to be her new home. She gradually
        descending into that building, gliding into a narrow vertical slit in
        the clapboard wall barely the height and width of her suspended body. 
      Two men were there to greet her. All she could see was their hairy legs
        right in front of her nose. Stall 42, they agreed was her destination.
        With a jolting movement the owners of those hairy legs, hauled her onto
        another overhead pulley. This one ran the length of the building. Jessica
        glided past identical stalls. Each had a low single bed and an equal
        width of floor space beside it. Looking down at the floor just a foot
        below her shaven head so saw the stall numbers painted in large numerals
        onto the concrete. she passed smoothly over them counting down 45,44,43
        and 42. She stopped with a jolt, causing her body to sway like a pendulum
        until she settled. In front of her was her new home, a prison cell but
        for the lack of a front wall. 
      One man hugged her dangling body lifting her an inch or two so the other
        man could pull her ankle cuffs free of the cableway&#146;s hook. They
        dropped her face-down onto the bed with no more care than a sack of potatoes
        was entitled to. Not that Jessica minded. Still weak and drowsy from
        the anaesthetic she had ceased caring about anything. With her head laying
        on a thin pillow Jessica was sure that sleep would claim her in seconds. 
      She heard a &#145;clip-clip&#146;, then her hands fell like dead weights
        onto the mattress, free of the plasticuffs that had secured them for
        three days. &#147;Sit up!&#148; one of the men said. Reluctantly, with
        weak aching arms she did as she was told, sitting on the side of the
        bed watching a man fix a long chain to the wall on the side away from
        the bed. Holding the loose end of the chain and a small padlock, he indicated
        with a brief touch that she should open her knees for him. He clipped
        the chain to the padlock in her labia. 
      &#147;Go to sleep. We&#146;ll bring you some food in an hour or two,&#148; one
        of the men said. Then, just as he walked away, &#147;My name&#146;s Jack,
        but you must call me Sir.&#148; 
      Jessica nodded to show she understood, but Jack had already gone. She
        noticed a folded freshly laundered cotton sheet laying on the bed. She
        unfolded it, laid down and covered herself. She was asleep in seconds. 
      
         *** 
       
      Jessica wasn&#146;t sure how long she had been asleep. The building
        was illuminated by daylight coming through the semi-opaque panels of
        roof. At first she thought it was morning, but the general noise around
        her sounded like arrivals, not departures. She sat up in bed, leaning
        against the brick wall, hugging her knees. A ponygirl walked past. Then
        another one went by a few minutes later. Jessica thought it strange that
        they should be unaccompanied and walking purposefully past without so
        much as a sideways glance in her direction. Then, when the third one
        walked past, she saw the reason: The cableway, which had carried her
        into this building, was also used to guide the ponygirls. A chain leash
        between it and the ponygirl&#146;s collar connected them to it. No wonder
        they walked with such purpose! It they stopped or slowed down they would
        fall and choke. 
      Jack was as good as his word, returning with a tray of food, and answered
        Jessica&#146;s question of how long she&#146;d slept - &#145;an hour
        or two&#146;, the time he said he&#146;d be gone for. It eased her disorientation
        a little, knowing that it was the same day. She hoped a night of unbroken
        rest still lay ahead of her. 
      He placed the tray on the floor. &#147;You&#146;re allowed to use your
        hands,&#148; he informed her, making it sound like a special privilege.
        Jessica said &#145;thank you, Sir&#146;, or rather she tried to, but
        her pierced and bruised tongue couldn&#146;t form the &#145;th&#146; sound.
        It came out a rasping &#145;hank koo her.&#146; Jack gave her sympathetic,
        slightly condescending, look and walked off. 
      She knelt down on the floor beside the bowls, constantly aware of the
        heavy chain attached to her labia. She acquired a habit of holding the
        chain at a point a foot away from her sex in order to relieve its weight,
        horrified at the thought of what might happen should she absentmindedly
        forget about it. At five-feet in length the chain was designed to give
        her the run of her stall but nothing more. It also asked the question:
        As the only restraint that kept her in the cell would she be prepared
        to rip her most tender flesh for a futile escape bid? The answer was
        no. At least for the moment. 
      After three days without solid food, Jessica&#146;s empty stomach heaved
        upon sight of the two bowls. She was at once drawn to yet repulsed by
        the contents. The toxic green colour of the mush in one bowl didn&#146;t
        help. She ate the stuff with her fingers. It was plain boiled vegetables,
        peas, cabbage, broccoli, courgettes and such. It wasn&#146;t bad, and
        Jessica figured it was designed as a safe reintroduction to solid food. 
      The other bowl contained what looked like dog biscuits; thick ovals
        in a rainbow of colours. A closer inspection revealed the brand name
        deeply impressed into them. It was a poignant taste of home. Her father&#146;s
        black labrador, many years dead now, loved these biscuits. Jessica picked
        up a red one together with the large paper cup which, with its plastic
        straw and lid, reminded her of something from a fast food restaurant. 
      She resumed her position on the bed taking the water and a biscuit with
        her. She sucked the cool water through a straw, idly meditating on the
        biscuit, until it could not be seen through her tear-filled eyes. The
        sudden memory of home triggered the deep sobbing that she had been promising
        herself all day.  
      After five minutes giving vent to her pent-up emotions her mind cleared,
        like air after a rainstorm. At last she felt awake enough to attempt
        to make sense of her predicament. She placed a finger into her mouth,
        trying to ascertain exactly what they had done. Her fingertip felt a
        screwed thread of steel rising up through her tongue. Further probing
        revealed that her lower back teeth had been removed and a steel bridge
        bonded between them. It was a miracle that she was able to eat anything,
        yet in providing her with food they clearly expected that should would
        be able. 
      In a subconscious gesture she ran her fingers through her hair, forgetting
        that it had been shaved off. It would not truly register until she could
        see herself. With absurd optimism she looked up at the walls, hoping
        there would be a mirror. Like most other women Jessica felt her identity
        was closely allied to her physical appearance. She was desperate to know who she
        was, what she had become. Had she been able to look into a mirror
        she would have seen that the ugly bruising on her cheeks from the dental
        work was far more alarming than her bald head. 
      The evening passed, punctuated by more of her new stablemates returning
        home. They and the male stable hands strode past her narrow view of the
        corridor with barely a glance in her direction. She didn&#146;t know
        whether to be pleased or disturbed that her appearance was not deemed
        worthy of a second glance.  
      Unlike the liberal regime within Rabbit Island&#146;s pony quarters,
        there was laughter here, only the occasionally sighs or quiet groans.
        The sound of subdued ponygirls and handlers going about their business. 
      Later that evening when the daylight had been replaced by gloom the
        familiar outline of Jack appeared in the corridor in front of Jessica&#146;s
        stall. She was already in bed curled up under the sheet, her left hand
        gripping her labia chain. It held her, but it was also something to hold
        on to. 
      &#147;Give me your hands,&#148; Jack instructed.  
      Jessica did as she was told, fully compliant as he fastened her wrists
        inot handcuffs which were connected by a chain to the top of the iron
        bed-frame.  
      &#147;In future, when you are ready to sleep you can fix the cuffs on
        yourself, you don&#146;t need to wait for me.&#148; He explained helpfully. 
      Her hands, although cuffed and chained could assume their normal prayerful
        position just as she always slept on Rabbit Island. She drifted off to
        sleep with one consolation. Tomorrow she would be a ponygirl again.

        THE LEATHERBODY 
      Jessica was awakened by the morning sunlight and the stirring of her
        as-yet-unseen neighbours in adjacent stalls. A man appeared and she was
        slightly disappointed it wasn&#146;t Jack. She felt she knew where she
        was with Jack. This other guy was similar to Jack in age and demeanour.
        His alternating shift partner, Jessica supposed, as he released her hands
        from the bed cuffs. 
         
      &#147;You need the toilet?&#148; he asked gruffly. 
      She nodded, feeling strangely ashamed at such an admission. A galvanised
        steel bucket, with a very worn wooden seat atop, was in the far corner
        of her cell. She&#146;d noticed it the previous evening, but had no need
        for it, except for a moment when she was eating and thought she might
        be about to retch. 
      The man watched expectantly, his forearms folded, accentuating his biceps,
        as Jessica shyly took up a position on the low potty. &#147;Three minutes!&#148; he
        warned as he walked away.  
      That was the best technique for encouraging ponygirls to finish their
        business promptly. Jessica evacuated her bowels without difficulty while
        her left hand continued to hold her labia chain out of habit. Though
        her mature piercings didn&#146;t cause any pain, she was aware of her
        stretching labia if she allowed the padlock and chain their full weight. 
      She noticed a small pail of water on the left side of the primitive
        commode on which she sat. Having spent a year on Rabbit Island toilet
        paper had become a distant memory to Jessica. She&#146;d become pretty
        good at keeping herself clean just with her fingers. Her business was
        concluded well within three minutes, she stood up and instinctively bowed
        her head, awaiting the man&#146;s return. 
      There was something about the very fabric of the building that compelled
        her to obedience - the place reeked of fear. Until she could find out
        more about this place she resolved not to put so much as a toe out of
        line. 
      The man returned, standing at the faded yellow line on the floor that
        demarked the boundary of her stall. &#147;Kneel down here with your back
        to me,&#148; he instructed. 
      She did so, shins on the flagstone flooring, her butt resting on her
        heels inches away from the man&#146;s legs. &#147;Hands held together
        behind your back,&#148; came his further instructions. 
      &#147;This is how you must wait for me in the mornings. Do you think
        you can manage that?&#148; 
      Jessica had a momentary urge to give a sarcastic response to his condescending
        question, but she held her tongue. In fact she became aware that the
        metal construction in her mouth literally held her tongue and would have
        rendered her riposte into a humiliating garble. 
      &#147;Yehh,&#148; she replied, unable to form the S sound. As a qualified
        speech therapist Jessica knew exactly what the problem was - her tongue&#146;s
        lack of mobility. 
      Suddenly he slapped her on the side of her head. &#147;No talking! Just &#145;Um&#146; for
        yes, &#145;uh-uh&#146; for no! Understand?&#148; he said harshly. 
      &#147;Um.&#148; Jessica replied, using the correct form. This new language
        would not take long to learn. 
      &#147;Good pony,&#148; he said, softening a little. From under the foot
        of her bed he pulled out a plastic crate containing pony equipment. Jessica
        hadn&#146;t realized she&#146;d been sleeping right on top of her tack. 
      She stayed motionless and upright as he dropped a heavy leather harness
        over her shoulders and began strapping it around her. As with Rabbit
        Island&#146;s harness her arms were crossed behind her so her wrists
        could be secured into padded leather cuffs in the small of her back.
        As he buckled them Jessica squirmed. She was responding to a familiar
        feeling; the position of her arms, the embrace of the leather straps
        banding her torso. Soon she would out in the open, running in harness,
        but free in spirit. She could hardly wait to feel her thighs pumping,
        the ground moving rapidly beneath her, her lungs filling with so much
        air that it felt like she could almost burst out of her straps. She wanted
        to tell him to hurry up with her dressing. 
      He still had a lot to do. &#147;Keep your head still,&#148; he instructed
        as he stretched a black neoprene hood over her shaven skull. It made
        a distinctive crinkly plasticky sound as he carefully peeled the hood
        down her face. First she was blinded, then her hearing became dulled
        as it covered her ears. His hands pushed against her bruised cheekbones
        until the hood snapped into place under her chin. Some final adjustments
        were needed. He pulled and pinched the hood until it was lined up correctly:
        Holes were positioned beneath her nostrils and in front of her eyes.
        Jessica&#146;s panic eased. She could see two circles of brickwork at
        the end of her cell, barely overlapping, as if looking through binoculars.
        The tiny holes in the hood negated for the need for pony blinkers. The
        man stretched the bottom of the hood until Jessica felt it constricting
        the middle of her neck. 
      &#147;Open up!&#148; said the man, &#147;nice and wide.&#148; 
      Jessica hesitated for a moment, slightly confused. Did he mean her legs?
        A fingertip brushed her lips, indicating that he meant her mouth, which
        was fully exposed through an oval hole in the hood. She opened her mouth,
        gasping at the sharp pain caused by the invasive metalwork fixed within.
        He pushed a one-inch wooden bit into her mouth, lodging it at the back
        of her bite. Whilst fitting it, the hole in the centre of the bit was
        penetrated by the threaded protrusion that skewered Jessica&#146;s tongue.
        Standing above and behind her kneeling body, the man gripped Jessica
        under the chin with one hand, and spun a wing nut onto the thread until
        it tightened against the wooden bit, leaving Jessica profoundly bitted.
        All but the tip of her tongue was locked down in the bowl of her mouth.
        Her jaw was locked open at the prescribed angle. 
      Then the man pulled a leather jacket around the front of Jessica&#146;s
        torso. It had no sleeves or armholes, and was shaped to fit the contours
        of a ponygirl with her arms bound behind her. 
      &#147;It&#146;s called a leatherbody&#148;, he informed Jessica, whilst
        tugging on the heavy zipper at the back. It reminded Jessica of her biker
        jacket, a gift from a motorcycle-riding former boyfriend. She loved wearing
        the jacket more than being on the back of the motorcycle - which frankly
        scared the life out of her. She particularly enjoyed it when her boyfriend
        pulled up the heavy zipper for her, causing the tight leather to squeeze
        her breasts within its corset-like embrace. Even now, in circumstances
        that could hardly be more different, Jessica felt a strange tingle of
        pleasure at the resurfaced memory. The leatherbody was zipped all the
        way up to her neck, fully overlapping the hem of the hood. 
      &#147;Good pony,&#148; the man muttered as he moved on to the next item. &#147;Chin
        up.&#148; 
      The heavy moulded posture collar was easy to fit. Hinged open at the
        front and snapping together at the back. Its elegant curvy shape fitted
        her from chin to shoulders, leaving Jessica&#146;s head immobile but
        for a little upward movement. 
      &#147;Lean forward, knees apart.&#148; 
      With one hand leaning on Jessica&#146;s back to steady himself, he knelt
        down and offered up the tail plug to her ass crack. Jessica felt its
        cool lubricated tip rubbing up and down over her anus. She responded
        as she was trained to, relaxing her muscles. &#145;Empty and yielding,
        don&#146;t fight it,&#146; Ray used to say. She felt the plug slip into
        her. It could hardly be said that she enjoyed wearing a tail plug all
        day, though she derived a moment of shameful pleasure from its penetration.
        Its proximity to her sex was just too apparent. She sensed this tail-plug
        was slightly longer and thinner than the Rabbit Island one. It was metallic
        too, she deduced by its coolness. 
      As with the other stages of her pony dressing she was unable to keep
        herself from making comparisons at each point. What else did she know
        these days, but ponygirl bondage, how to trot, and how to respond to
        whips and reins. In such things she was an expert. 
      Her regular Rabbit Island butt-plug used an internal inflatable bulb
        that was pumped up after insertion, so it needed no other means to secure
        it. Being made of metal, this one didn&#146;t pump. 
       From the bottom front of the leatherbody a long flat leather leash
        hung down. The man threaded it firstly through her labial padlock, and
        then pulled it between her legs and through a slot at the base of the
        butt-plug. It was drawn tightly up her spine to her neck. 
      The peremptory click of a padlock at the back of her collar signalled
        the conclusion of Jessica&#146;s new style of harnessing. This padlock,
        she noted, was the only lock used on her garment. Nothing, not the hood,
        not the harness, nor the leather body, the neck-brace, or the tail plug
        could be removed while that padlock remained shut. Even with the leatherbody
        between it and her skin, she could feel the padlock&#146;s weight against
        the top of her spine, teasing and taunting her. 
      &#147;Sit on the bed,&#148; the handler said, in a tone neither harsh
        nor kind. Jessica rose easily to her feet, aided by him grabbing the
        handle sewn into the back of the leatherbody. She&#146;d forgotten her
        labia padlock was still chained to the wall. It tugged slightly as she
        made a quarter turn and sat on the bed. It felt funny, her legs and feet
        naked whilst above her hips she was utterly encased in leather and latex. 
      With her knees open, Jessica looked downwards and saw the pony tail
        spilling onto the bed between them. It was her own hair, bound in a thick
        plait. Meanwhile the handler hung a long blonde plait on a hook on the
        wall directly in front of her. It was Rachel&#146;s, sheared off just
        in case Jessica needed a blonde tail. She ached for Rachel, her glorious
        flowing locks cruelly shorn just so she could have a blonde tail! Jessica
        knew she would treasure it and keep it safe for her, even though it could
        never be restored. 
      &#147;When you make the grade, you&#146;ll get the blonde tail.&#148; The
        man explained, as if a ponygirl could wish for nothing finer in life. 
      Jessica&#146;s squawky outburst surprised the handler as he tried to
        put on the ponyboots. She&#146;d recognised they were her own pair from
        Rabbit Island. (Nobody appreciates a comfortable pair of boots as much
        as a ponygirl!) It was as if her quality of life had improved in an instant.
        The handler smiled as he realized the sound was not distress but was
        sheer delight and relief. Putting them on her he noticed they fitted
        her as well as any boots he&#146;d ever seen. Her feet and those boots
        seemed to belong together, he thought, as he tightly laced to them to
        mid-calf. 
      The final item of Jessica&#146;s new outfit was a bright steel chain
        - a &#145;Y chain&#146; they called it. The carabiner-style clips at
        each end were snapped to Jessica&#146;s nipple rings and to her labia
        padlock to create a Y of chain on the front of her leather-clad torso. 
      &#147;Up!&#148; the handler commanded with a tug on the chain. She rose
        to her feet. With the added inches of the sole and the hoof angle of
        the boots, she was now taller than he was. &#147;Nice teeth,&#148; he
        casually commented. The design of the hood and the bit between her teeth
        served to accentuate the beauty of a ponygirl&#146;s mouth. 
      He led Jessica by her Y chain, thereby demonstrating its primary purpose,
        towards the overhead cableway that ran along the length of the stable
        block. He positioned her beneath the cableway and stood in front of her.
        Even with her limited sight Jessica could see he was watching and waiting
        for something to arrive from behind her. He made a sudden grab and took
        hold of a dangling leash. In a quick and fluent move he clipped the connector
        to a large D ring at the front of Jessica&#146;s collar and moved swiftly
        to the side just as she felt an imperative tug. 
      All Jessica could do was concentrate on walking and not falling as she
        was pulled along by the cableway&#146;s leash. The boots were fine of
        course, but the ponygirl bondage was different to Rabbit Island&#146;s
        strict yet sensual strapping. The leatherbody, the tight neoprene hood
        and the neck brace combined to contain and control her utterly. Though
        she was curious to see who or what was in her neighbouring stalls, she
        simply couldn&#146;t. The rigid collar and the tunnel-vision eyesight
        granted by the hood kept her eyes on what was ahead of her. 
      Ten yards ahead was another ponygirl, leashed to the cableway, and attired
        like Jessica, right down to the plaited tail swishing between her thighs.
        This ponygirl walked with a distinctive high-stepping clip. Jessica attempted
        to do the same, raising her knees higher and increasing the pace while
        shortening her stride. Whether it was a requirement or not, Jessica knew
        it would warm her up better than strolling in pace with her leash. It
        felt good to be moving her legs again. Still with Rabbit Island&#146;s
        performance enhancing drugs within her system she craved exercise almost
        as much as, usually more than, sex. 
      As the mechanised leash continued leading her at a medium trot Jessica
        sensed that something was very different. It was her boots - they were
        silent! The bells that had jingled to every step she&#146;d ever taken
        as a ponygirl had been removed. Only the dull thud of her rubber soles
        on the concrete floor remained. It wasn&#146;t so much the sound of her
        own bells she missed but the reassuring sound of the other ponygirls.
        She could recognize each of them by the unique cadence of the bells alone. 
      She emerged into the bright outdoors and into a new regime. A man unhooked
        her leash from the overhead cableway and led her to the training and
        evaluation ring. 
       
        RACING THE CLOCK 
      Jessica was clipped onto a frame, which felt similar to being harnessed
        to a ponytrap. It was what they called a rotator - a large revolving
        frame with braced ten-metre long arms with harness attachments at the
        ends. Normally it was equipped with four arms to hold four ponygirls
        for pace training. Today it was set in clock racing mode. That
        is to say there were just two arms, which could rotate independently
        around the axis like the hands of a clock. The ten-metre radius of the
        arm provided the ponygirl with a lap of just over sixty metres. 
      Another ponygirl was being attached to the other arm on the opposite
        side of the frame though Jessica with her tunnel vision and unyielding
        neck brace was not yet aware of her fellow pony. She was however aware
        of being attached to the frame by multiple attachment points at the back
        of her leatherbody. Then there were meddling hands around her buttocks
        and tail. Her handler had connected an electrical wire from the rotator
        to her butt plug. 
      Suddenly Jessica felt a sharp pain deep within her rectum. 
      &#147;When you feel that, you walk,&#148; her handler shouted like a
        drill sergeant. &#147;Always right hoof first!&#148; 
      Jessica walked at the steady purposeful pace she knew well - slightly
        more than three miles an hour. 
      &#147;Good!&#148; the handler shouted encouragingly as Jessica completed
        a couple of circuits. She could tell by the fading of his voice that
        he stood in the same place waiting for her to complete each circuit.
        Halfway around the circuit another man stood, although he barely acknowledged
        her. The vocal affirmations of Jessica&#146;s handler did not prevent
        his application of his whip on her buttocks each time she passed him.
        Jessica became aware of somebody else, another ponygirl slightly affecting
        her rhythm, but it was company of sorts and she was glad of it. 
      &#147;When you feel two jolts you trot!&#148; he explained slowly and
        loudly after Jessica&#146;s second circuit, making quite certain he would
        only say it once. 
      Seconds later, Jessica felt two painful contractions like sharp cramps
        deep within her. She trotted as required, a formal high stepping trot,
        but it seemed so lifeless without the jingling of boot bells, and harder
        to maintain a rhythm. Then Jessica felt something change. Up until then
        the two hands of the monstrous rotating frame were fixed opposite each
        other forcing the ponygirls to run at the same pace. Then the occasional
        jolts transmitted from the ponygirl on the other side of the circle ceased.
        The two rotating arms had been unlocked and could turn at their own pace
        like hands on a very large clock. 
      The whip lashed her buttocks again. &#147;Move it! The race has started!&#148; her
        handler yelled. A race? Jessica was confused for a moment, but she understood
        the word race well enough.She shifted her pace up a gear. 
      Jessica was beginning to adapt to the tightness of the leatherbody and
        the collar. The rigidity of her posture and the way the leatherbody sheltered
        her from the breeze seemed to concentrate her mind on the task in hand
        - pumping her thighs and moving with her unique little jiggle that pony
        drivers had often commented on. It felt good to be running again, her
        lungs filling her chest, which pushed against the leather bands encircling
        it. 
      The two hands of this bizarre clock had moved from the opposite positions
        they occupied earlier. The whip hit Jessica&#146;s buttocks yet again. &#147;Faster.
        She&#146;s gaining on you!&#148; her handler yelled urgently. Why didn&#146;t
        he say so earlier? Jessica thought to herself as she stepped up another
        gear, gladly trading grace for pace. 
      Five more circuits brought five more swipes of the whip, but the handler&#146;s
        accompanying tone of voice seemed more optimistic, until on one pass
        the whip was coupled with a shout of &#147;atta girl!&#148; His encouragement
        helped, but Jessica knew she could have run much faster if only Debbie
        was at her side and the commanding reassuring presence of Riccardo was
        behind her. 
      After another five circuits seeing nothing but the repetition of two
        handlers coming in and out of her sight, something else entered her field
        of vision. It was her opponent, clad in a leatherbody, hooded and neck-braced
        just like she was. The girl was beginning to struggle. Her running was
        losing form, not helped by the angry ranting of her handler. Jessica&#146;s
        handler wasn&#146;t even using the whip now. She could even see his smile
        as she ran past him. 
      Jessica was gaining rapidly on the girl, like a hunter about to pounce
        on her prey. When she was four yards behind the girl and closing with
        each stride, the ponygirl collapsed. Jessica ran into her, unable to
        stop in time. The beaten ponygirl slumped, but harnessed to the steel
        arm she could not fall to the ground. Jessica bent forward panting for
        breath, sensing heat and perspiration building within her leatherbody
        as she fought to recover. The handlers detached the defeated ponygirl
        from her harnessing points and let her slump lifelessly to the ground. 
      &#147;Give her a beating and send her to the mines,&#148; Jessica&#146;s
        handler instructed the other. He seemed to take a certain pleasure at
        those words. &#147;I told you this new one was quality but you didn&#146;t
        believe me!&#148; 
      At such a triumphant moment on Rabbit Island Jessica would have expected
        a condescending yet oddly pleasurable petting and sweet-talking session
        from her driver. Things were very different here. The handler took hold
        of Jessica&#146;s Y chain and led her from the training circuit. 
      Fifty yards along the track a team of ponygirls was waiting. There were
        three of them, two in front and one behind, with space for another beside
        her. They were all identically attired in their black hoods and leatherbodies.
        Jessica figured that was exactly how she looked too or she wouldn&#146;t
        be joining their team. 
      The three ponygirls were standing between a pair of railway tracks,
        hitched to a four-seat open wagon with a flatbed area behind. Unable
        to look downwards, Jessica&#146;s toes kicked then stumbled over the
        rail. The handler snapped a series of metal fastenings to the D rings
        of her leatherbody. She felt her head pulled back as the rings at the
        sides of her built-in bit were connected to unseen reins. Something was
        happening to her butt tail, Jessica could feel somebody connecting something. &#145;Wiring
        her up&#146; she heard the handler say. She felt an excruciating pain
        in her belly, an electrical discharge from the anal insert.  
      &#147;Working fine,&#148; the handler called out, chuckling to the driver.
        Their fun wasn&#146;t for sharing with ponygirls. 
      Then Jessica felt smaller jolt in her belly. Immediately her fellow
        ponygirls leant forward, gradually hauling the carriage into motion.
        Jessica instinctively joined in, imitating the ponygirl four feet in
        front of her. The railway track descended a slope causing the ponygirls
        to reach full pace almost at once. A ton of wagon rolling behind them
        was all the incentive the ponygirls needed to keep running. 
      Suddenly, after five minutes of steady running along a flat route the
        rails began to slope upward. Jessica strained with effort, feeling her
        lack of fitness and unsure if she could pull any harder. 
       
        THE PONYGIRL EXPRESS 
        (Riccardo and Jessica) 
      Riccardo stood next to his guide, Peter, whom he had gotten to know on
      the recent boat journey to the island. They were standing at one of five
      stopping places for the Ponygirl Express. The six miles of railway tracks
      that these ponygirls travelled all day long linked the key facilities of
      the island like a scheduled passenger service; so regular that a printed
      timetable was displayed on a nearby lamppost. 
       
      Witnessing the team of four ponygirls stamping energetically towards
        them, Riccardo was impressed. The slight incline of the track immediately
        before the halt was designed to take the speed out of the ponygirls&#146; gait,
        yet if their pace dropped too early they would falter halfway and their
        carriage would roll backwards down the slope, taking four humiliated
        ponygirls with it. This time the ponygirls came to a halt directly in
        front of Riccardo and Peter. Two men jumped down from the carriage, exchanging
        a chummy greeting with Peter and a welcome to Riccardo. 
      Riccardo looked the ponygirls up and down. Covered in leather and latex,
        all but their thighs and buttocks, there was little for his eyes to appreciate
        apart from the sleek and strict bondage they endured. They were impressive
        without doubt, but he missed the intimate, almost teasing, strapping
        of a naked body that was such an essential part of the Rabbit Island
        ponygirls. Hooded in black latex, these ponygirls lacked the appealing
        individuality which Rabbit Island ponygirls retained even after their
        thorough training. They look so anonymous, he commented to Peter. That
        was the whole point, Peter explained, the suppression of individuality
        so that these females are just faceless parts of a machine. 
      Peter and Riccardo stepped up into the carriage. They had the four seats
        to themselves. 
      &#147;No driver?&#148; Riccardo asked. 
      &#147;Not required!&#148; Peter answered. &#147;We just give them the
        signal to start.&#148; He pressed a green button on the simple dashboard
        control panel. The four ponygirls seemed to judder in unison before leaning
        forward and pulling the carriage into motion. A few yards along the track
        they were on a downward slope and building up the speed needed to reach
        the next destination. 
      &#147;The green button sends a little shock into the ponygirls&#146; asses.
        That&#146;s their signal to go. The one at the front right hand side
        is the leader, the others keep in step with her. They have to maintain
        a fast pace so they have enough momentum to make it up the slope at the
        next station,&#148; said Peter as they glided along. &#147;If they fail
        to make it up the slope they&#146;ll be punished, but that seldom happens.&#148; 
      The journey along the tracks was fast and smooth. Riccardo could readily
        see how efficient this arrangement was. It answered one of his questions
        - why there was such a high proportion of ponygirls to drivers on the
        island. The statistic had confused him when it was first mentioned. Now
        he understood. Here were four ponygirls working the whole day long without
        the aid of a driver. 
      The track-borne ride was so very different to the twisting undulating
        trails of Rabbit Island, the jogging of the ponygirls didn&#146;t transmit
        to the carriage like the two-pony configuration he was used to. Out of
        pony driver habit he studied the buttocks and thighs of the ponygirl
        immediately in front of him checking for rhythm and form. Then he realized
        they were more than just familiar, it was Jessica&#146;s distinctive
        wiggle that he knew so well! The recently applied brand in the centre
        of her left buttock left no doubt in his mind. The satisfaction of discovering
        her whereabouts was tempered by the realization of what day-to-day life
        would be like for her. 
      Jessica had recognized Riccardo long before then. He&#146;d been standing
        next to her, talking to Peter, for a couple of minutes before they set
        off. To avoid mutual embarrassment she had made no attempt to make her
        presence known to him. She knew he would figure it out soon enough. 
      They were approaching a cluster of buildings. It was a much smarter
        quarter of the Island than Riccardo had seen before. Without any prompting,
        the ponygirls began to speed up a little in anticipation of the halt&#146;s
        incline fifty yards ahead of them. Once again their approach speed, their
        deceleration and gentle stop were faultless, even allowing for one new
        ponygirl in their quartet. 
       
        THE BITCH FRAME 
        (Kate) 
      After Riccardo and Peter dismounted from the carriage, Peter leaned
        over to push the green button. After the pony team had received the customary
        jolt, the Ponygirl Express trotted off, unattended and unladen, towards
        its next stop. 
      Riccardo heard dogs yapping, not just one or two, but a whole pack.
        On Rabbit Island there were only a couple of hounds in the orchard, friendly
        mutts that scarcely made a sound. 
      Peter led him to a sprawling complex of single story units opening onto
        a large area of lawn with mature trees forming its border. 
      &#147;Do you have bitch-dog training on Rabbit Island?&#148; Peter asked
        as they walked. 
      &#147;No we don&#146;t, just puppy-girl training. Nothing with animals.&#148; Riccardo
        replied. He knew exactly what Peter meant by bitch-dog training, the
        incessant yapping of the dogs in the near distance confirmed it. 
      They turned the corner of a building and came upon the bitches - four
        of them sitting on padded mats alongside a long wall, about two metres
        apart. The naked women wore heavy studded leather collars, by which they
        were chained to the wall. Their hands and feet were leather mitted in
        the same fashion as Rabbit Island's puppygirl regime. Hands were held
        in a useless fist shape. Feet were subjected to the pressure pad devices
        in the soles of the mittens that emitted a painful shock if the bitch
        attempted to stand. These new ones, said Peter, were dual punishment
        models utilising sharp needles AND electric shocks. 
      The four bitches, seeing the two men approach, dutifully assumed their
        doggy-style hands and knees position, looking up at the men, with their
        mouths wide open as if awaiting a treat. Their upward curving tails,
        emanating from their butt plugs, wagged gently to indicate their apparent
        pleasure at the men&#146;s arrival. Thin black leather crotch belts held
        the plugs in position. 
      Peter grabbed the short hair of one of the bitches tilting her head
        up to Riccardo. She grimaced at the strain on her hair but was otherwise
        a model of obedience. 
      &#147;Ever used these gags before?&#148; Peter asked. 
      Riccardo peered into the gaping mouth and noticed a metallic framework
        within. Ingenious, he thought. 
      &#147;It holds the mouth open but they can still eat. Close your mouth!&#148; he
        commanded the bitch. She did so, but very slowly, and with obvious effort.
        After a couple of seconds her mouth was wide open again. 
      &#147;You see? Spring loaded!&#148; Peter delighted in explaining. &#147;They
        can eat, but speech is very difficult. They can&#146;t close their mouths
        quick enough.&#148; 
      Peter let go of the bitch&#146;s hair and moved to the second one. He
        took another gag from the shelf above her, one unique to the bitches.
        It was a real animal bone with leather cords tied to each end. He pushed
        the bone into the bitch&#146;s mouth like a bit gag and fastened the
        cords at the back of her head. This bitch had copper-red hair, obviously
        dyed, cut in a short, shaggy style which seemed perfectly suited her
        status. Closer inspection showed her face was made up - lips a deep red,
        eyes shadowed in black and brows accentuated. Riccardo was quite taken
        with a nervous looking russet-haired bitch looking at him. She appeared
        familiar to him, as well she might. The hair and make up couldn&#146;t
        disguise that it was Kate. 
      Riccardo recalled how delicious Kate looked and acted as a puppy girl
        on Rabbit Island so he wasn&#146;t at all sorry to see her resuming a
        canine role. He especially liked how her ass was plugged with a curved
        dog tail and split by a neat crotchbelt - liked in the sense of feeling
        his penis growing to fill its restrictive tube. The perspex restraint
        curtailed his erection, making him strangely glad not to be adding another
        bone to the scene. It was, after all, his first day on the job! 
      Peter unhooked Kate&#146;s leash from the wall and led her crawling
        onto the lawn. Riccardo walked on Kate&#146;s other side as they made
        towards a shady area beneath some large trees. 
      Kate stopped, digging in her front paws and tensing her limbs until
        her leash pulled taught. Peter laughed, moved his grip to her collar
        and dragged her the remaining two metres to the wrought iron bitch-frame. 
      &#147;Grab her arm and put the shackle on it!&#148; Peter told Riccardo,
        as he hauled the reluctant Kate onto the frame. He often met with this
        kind of rebellion. Kate&#146;s struggles were feeble compared to others
        who, fittingly, fought like dogs to avoid being fixed to the bitch-frame. 
      Once her wrists were locked into the front shackles Kate&#146;s resistance
        was reduced to gestures. Her knees and ankles were soon buckled into
        the frame. Two straps dangling from its underside fastened across her
        back, leaving her immobile and exposed in the doggy position. A chin
        holder with a protruding spike was adjusted to keep her head facing forward
        rather than downwards. 
      &#147;We&#146;ll take out the butt plug,&#148; Peter said, &#147;just
        to provide more options. Can you pass me the dog skin from that bag?&#148; 
      Riccardo pulled out the bristly Alsatian hide and draped it across Kate&#146;s
        back. The velcro straps at its corners fastened under Kate&#146;s armpits
        and around the tops of her thighs holding the hide in place like a coat. 
      &#147;Dog claws can be pretty sharp but the hide should protect her
        back from the worst of it.&#148; Peter said as the two men looked down
        at Kate&#146;s trembling body. &#147;Could you get the lube please?&#148; 
      Riccardo reached into the bag again to retrieve a small, pump-handled
        oil can, like one he used as a kid for maintaining his pushbike. He squirted
        it liberally onto Kate&#146;s exposed sex then poked the nozzle between
        her pussy lips and squeezed again. He rubbed in the light oil with the
        palm of his hand, a finger slipping between her labia into her moistening
        folds. His gentle but insistent rubbing was soon rewarded. Kate couldn&#146;t
        help herself. She rattled the frame in response. The ironwork was designed
        to clang and rattle a bit, Peter explained, the videos were much more
        interesting with a little noise and movement from the bitch&#146;s struggles. 
      &#147;Nice looking bitch. Cute ass.&#148; Peter commented casually as
        he moved towards the surrounding trees. &#147;One of yours?&#148; 
      &#147;Not exactly mine,&#148; Riccardo chuckled, with a hint of regret
        in his voice, &#147;but yes, she&#146;s from Rabbit Island.&#148; 
      Peter was busily adjusting several small cameras fixed to the surrounding
        tree trunks whilst speaking to somebody on a walkie-talkie. All the cameras
        were focussed on Kate, who was about to play a starring role in a long-running
        video series. 
      As if Kate wasn&#146;t fixed securely enough, Riccardo had noticed the
        bottom of the frame was equipped with nipple clamps at the ends of light
        chains. Each in turn, he pinched the clamps between the finger and thumb
        of one hand while his other pulled downwards on Kate&#146;s substantial
        nipples to bring then within reach of the serrated-edge bite of the clamps. 
      Kate yelped, her eyes widening with shock, as the vicious clamps bit
        into her nipples. It was no more or less a reaction than Riccardo expected.
        He must have clamped a thousand nipples in the last couple of years on
        Rabbit Island. He stroked her short red hair, very taken with how its
        vibrant copper colour complemented the blue eyes looking up at him. 
      Peter was done with his camera tweaking. He and Riccardo walked away
        leaving Kate rattling against the metal restraints of the frame. Riccardo
        took a last look over his shoulder. Did he feel guilty about her treatment
        or just regretful that he couldn&#146;t take advantage while she was
        secured in the position he liked the most? 
       
        BURIED 
        (Mandy) 
      Two strange lumps were protruding from the lawn in front of Peter and
        Riccardo. Positioned eight feet apart the black cloth bags looked like
        improvised goalposts for a casual soccer game, but these bags were moving! 
      Peter bent over one of them. Riccardo instinctively stationed himself
        above the other, watching as Peter pulled the bag off the object. It
        was a woman&#146;s head. She was very much alive, but silent due to the
        wide strips of tape plastered over her mouth. 
      Riccardo pulled off the cloth bag between his feet. It was Mandy, shaking
        her head angrily and managing to complain despite the tape gagging her.
        He ripped the tape from her mouth. She strained her head back against
        the manicured lawn around her neck. 
      &#147;Ouch! That hurt! Riccardo, Sir, look what they&#146;ve done to
        me!&#148; she cried. &#147;They strapped me up and buried me. I need
        water, but they won&#146;t give me any.&#148;  
      Burial had certainly not dulled the edge from Mandy&#146;s notorious
        complaining. Riccardo saw her mouth within licking distance of the toe
        of his shoe. It was as low as somebody could get. He felt a degree of
        sympathy for her, though he knew that her habitual whining was probably
        the cause of her current predicament 
      &#147;She refused to drink last night.&#148; Peter said. He was kneeling
        down feeding bread to his own buried girl. 
      &#147;Drink?&#148; Mandy responded indignantly. &#147;Those dogs were
        pissing on me!&#148; 
      Peter had the measure of Mandy already. He merely laughed.&#147;So are
        you going to drink this morning, or shall we gag you again?&#148; 
      &#147;What choice do I have? I don&#146;t want to die of thirst!&#148; Mandy
        replied with resignation. 
      As they were walking away Peter clarified. &#147;They&#146;re not actually
        buried. She&#146;s strapped up inside a tube which slots into a prepared
        hole on in the ground. Then the turf is carefully rolled around her neck.
        And the dogs, they&#146;re fed a diuretic. It makes their urine weak
        and quite palatable enough for a thirsty slave.&#148; 
      After Mandy and her companion had been watered by the dogs, they would
        be fitted with red ballgags and dark sunglasses. A miserable day of taunts
        and teasing awaited them, as that area of the lawn was the open-air extension
        to the canteen, regularly used for coffee breaks and lunches. 
      Suddenly a motley pack of dogs raced from an enclosure at the far side
        of the lawn, barking and yapping as they gambolled over towards Kate
        and the two buried girls. Peter and Riccardo watched from a short distance.
        The dogs began marking Mandy and the other girl. Mandy&#146;s head went
        back, facing towards the sky, and her mouth opened wide as she tried
        to catch the spray of a large Alsatian. 
      Over by the trees Riccardo could see a dalmatian had already mounted
        Kate, while another muzzled dog was trying to lick her face. He was too
        far away to see or hear Kate&#146;s reaction but there was no doubting
        his own. His penis swelled until it painfully filled its plastic tube.
        His hand involuntarily rubbed against his crotch. Oh to be a dog! Knowing
        that he would be able to watch the video of Kate&#146;s animal rape later
        that night left Riccardo with mixed feelings. Sympathy for Kate? Yes,
        but lust and jealousy too. It was the last of these that concerned him
        the most. 
       
        THE BANGKOK AND DISTRICT PRIVATE SANATORIUM 
        (Alex) 
      Doctor Alexander Kundera collected his visitor&#146;s badge from the
        charming Thai receptionist. He clipped the badge to the breast pocket
        of his linen jacket and walked the corridors of the sanatorium searching
        for the reason for his visit, and the cause, indirectly, of Rabbit Island&#146;s
        current demise. 
         
      Like many of the doors he passed, the door to room 234 was already wide
        open so as to allow sunlight to the corridor. Alex had to lean into the
        room to read the number, confirming he&#146;d found the right one. A
        young woman was sitting in one of the two chairs, staring serenely out
        of the window at the lush gardens. 
      &#147;Good morning,&#148; Alex offered awkwardly, realizing that he
        didn&#146;t have a name to append to his greeting. 
      &#147;Jane. They&#146;ve registered me as Jane Doe, but they call me
        Janie. Are you Doctor Kun... something?&#148; She asked. 
      &#147;Kundera - but please call me Alex. Pleased to meet you, Janie.&#148; 
      &#147;They said you were a well known writer, but I haven&#146;t heard
        of you. I hope you&#146;re not offended. I haven&#146;t heard of anyone
        else either!&#148; 
      &#147;Don&#146;t worry. I&#146;m only famous for books on psychology,&#148; Alex
        said self-deprecatingly, trying to put her at ease. &#147;I&#146;ve written
        a few. Cases of memory loss like yours are my speciality.&#148; 
      &#147;Have you ever known one who lost her arms too?&#148; she asked. 
      Alex hadn&#146;t consciously registered that her elbow-length sleeves
        were empty, not until she mentioned it in such stark terms. He lived
        on an island where females so often had the hands tied behind them that
        the visual absence of Janie&#146;s hands didn&#146;t seem in the least
        unusual. He had noticed her face, quite pretty but with overly tanned
        skin, heavily freckled. Her fair hair was short, just covering her ears,
        and seemed prematurely greying. He&#146;d also noticed her breasts, their
        full shape evident beneath the loose V-neck tee shirt. 
      There was an almost full glass of water on the table in front of the
        girl. Alex breezily took it away, muttering words about fixing a couple
        of fresh drinks for them. The kitchenette was conveniently behind the
        girl&#146;s back. 
      Engaging someone with complete memory loss in idle chit-chat wasn&#146;t
        easy but Alex managed a faltering conversation as he unzipped the black
        leather wallet containing Dr. Schmidt&#146;s potions. His fingertips
        touched each one in turn: Truth, memory and, if necessary, death. First
        the water, then the potion, poured very gently. Finally, remembering
        the doctor&#146;s advice he placed the straw in the glass but didn&#146;t
        stir. 
      Alex placed their drinks on the table and diligently arranged his notepad
        and tape recorder between them. &#147;Cheers,&#148; he said with a degree
        of irony as he took a long drink from his glass. As he expected, the
        young woman mirrored him, leaning forward and sipping at least an inch
        of water through her straw. 
      The interview commenced. Alex knew the truth drug would hit Janie&#146;s
        system within ten minutes. He could tell by her irritable responses that
        his line of questioning was the same as she had been subjected to many
        times in the previous weeks. She knew nothing of her past life. 
      Dr Schmidt&#146;s truth drug didn&#146;t change matters, except to reveal
        the depths of her despair. 
      &#147;I can&#146;t slit my wrists, I can&#146;t take an overdose, but
        I can jump in front of a truck as well as anybody. Every evening after
        dark, when nobody can see me, I go for a walk around the hospital perimeter.
        Heavy trucks pass by just a few yards away, and I often think of stepping
        in front of one,&#148; said Janie, her eyes piercing his, carrying the
        conviction of her words. 
      Alex didn&#146;t react, except to write in his notes: &#145;Stage B:
        Freely admitted to suicidal thoughts.&#146; 
      &#147;I&#146;m useless aren&#146;t I? I can&#146;t do anything for myself.
        I don&#146;t even know my own name. I can&#146;t dress myself, feed myself.
        I even need somebody&#146;s help to go to the god damn bathroom!&#148; 
      Alex listened impassively while making notes - a psychologist&#146;s
        regular defence when there are no words for an adequate reply. She sucked
        the remainder of her water. Doctor Schmidt was right. The first potion
        had given her a thirst. He got up from his chair and refilled their glasses.
        After truth came memory, or so Doctor Schmidt planned.
        Alex wasn&#146;t so sure. 
      &#147;I feel I can trust you,&#148; said Janie, &#147;like I can tell
        you anything... except I can&#146;t remember anything to tell you.&#148; 
      Alex chuckled with her at the irony. Her trust was borne out of a drug,
        as indeed her memories might soon be. 
      Meanwhile Alex was in search of a truth he didn&#146;t want to hear,
        and for once hoped that Doctor Schmidt&#146;s medicine would fail. He
        showed Janie a series of photographs. A dog, a house, a baby, a mountain,
        a bicycle, a pizza, a rock band, a canoe, and hundreds more. She knew
        what things were but not how they might apply to her own existence. 
      &#147;I need to look at the wounds.&#148; Alex said, breaking the awkward
        silence as they stared at the photographs scattered across the table. &#147;Do
        you mind if I touch you?&#148; 
      &#147;I can&#146;t stop you,&#148; she replied, &#147;but no, I don&#146;t
        mind at all if you touch. The staff here are very kind to me. Very polite
        and considerate.&#148; 
      She couldn&#146;t help adjusting her posture as Alex stood up and stepped
        behind her. He bent over her, breathing on her neck as his hands lifted
        the tee shirt clear of her head. Without arms to impede its progress
        the garment seemed disturbingly easy to lift clear. These were full bone
        amputations. Usually a surgeon will endeavour to save something below
        the shoulder to facilitate prosthetics, but not in Janie&#146;s case. 
      &#147;Did they inform you that I would touch you in intimate places?&#148; Alex
        asked. 
      Janie swallowed and nodded. &#147;Yes, they told me that. I trust you.&#148; 
      He moved his hands towards her shorts. Unbuckling the belt, unbuttoning
        and unzipping, he eased her shorts down over her hips until they fell
        to her ankles. The tattoo near her labia was indeed a rabbit motif -
        a poor imitation of a design formerly used on Rabbit Island. 
      &#147;What&#146;s the significance of the rabbit?&#148; Janie asked. 
      &#147;I really don&#146;t know.&#148; Alex answered thoughtfully. It
        was true, he didn&#146;t know the significance of this particular rabbit. 
      He placed a folded towel on the wooden seat and sat the girl down on
        it. Then he blindfolded her with a sleep mask - the type commonly used
        on airlines. This one was marked Qantas, and came from a complimentary
        pack from his most recent journey. 
      &#147;Comfortable?&#148; Alex asked, taking up a position behind her
        chair. 
      &#147;Fine, thank you,&#148; Janie replied with a Mona Lisa smile. This
        was the most stimulating thing that had happened to her since she could
        remember. 
      He kissed her on the head, then on her shoulders. His hands moved to
        her breasts and her nipples. They hardened in response to his touch. &#147;Tell
        me if you want me to stop. Tell me what you are thinking.&#148; 
      &#147;Nothing, except it feels nice to be touched. Alex, do you think
        I&#146;ve made love before?&#148; 
      &#147;I&#146;m sure you have,&#148; Alex said with confidence. &#147;Does
        this bring back good memories? If you don&#146;t know, take a guess.&#148; 
      &#147;It feels good, but I don&#146;t sense any memories. I feel relaxed
        and happy. A little excited too.&#148; Janie giggled. 
      As she was still under the influence of the truth drug, Alex had no
        reason to doubt her. He pulled on her nipples, (fit for a ponygirl, he
        thought to himself), stretching and squeezing them. They&#146;d been
        pierced in the recent past, he could tell by the marks. He took his hands
        away. 
      &#147;No. Please don&#146;t stop. Can&#146;t you keep doing that? Perhaps
        I might think of something if you keep going,&#148; Janie suggested. 
      Alex resumed his ministrations, his fingers moving lightly on her ribs
        and belly. 
      &#147;Hey, that tickles!&#148; Janie protested feebly. Soon Alex had
        her laughing and then begging as she squirmed in her seat, unable and
        unwilling to prevent the delicious assault. 
      &#147;Lower please, go lower,&#148; she said, her breathing rapid and
        trembling. 
      &#147;What would you like me to do?&#148; Alex asked. It was a cruel
        thing to ask somebody under the influence of a truth drug. 
      &#147;Fuck me!&#148; she blurted out, before realizing what she had
        said. &#147;Oh god, you&#146;re a doctor! I&#146;m sorry. Why would anyone
        want to have sex with a freak anyway?&#148; 
      &#147;You&#146;ve a very fuckable body,&#148; Alex said, entering into
        the spirit of truthfulness for a moment. 
      His fingers had reached her short, formerly shaved, pubic hair. Stroking
        its silkiness, teasing her. He dipped lower, touching her labia pressing
        lightly on her clitoral hood. He would not go further until she revealed
        something, anything, to him. 
      Fifteen minutes of on-and-off teasing torment elapsed. Janie, sitting
        naked and blindfolded, was in despair, knowing that the relief and pleasure
        she craved was so close. Yet her memory was as dark as the blindfold
        itself. She sensed Alex was about to call a halt to his examination.
        They had another appointment for the same time tomorrow. 
      She wanted nothing more than to feel Alex&#146;s fingers between her
        legs, even just for a few seconds. Suddenly, something came into her
        mind. 
      &#147;Two lines!&#148; she said fervently. &#147;Two lines in the darkness.&#148; 
      &#147;What kind of lines?&#148; Alex asked, his fingers brushing her
        clitoris and moist labia as a reward. 
      &#147;They&#146;re shiny. Parallel lines. Curving.&#148; She was becoming
        agitated, excited at the thought of giving birth to a memory as much
        as she was by Alex&#146;s long-awaited physical reward. 
      &#147;Like railway tracks?&#148; Alex probed. Janie sighed as he continued
        to lightly stroke her; helping her to what she hoped was an inevitable
        outcome. 
      &#147;Two lines, yes, like railway tracks... Oh God. Don&#146;t stop...
        tracks. Does that mean something?&#148; 
      It wasn&#146;t the question to ask a psychologist, to whom everything
        means something. Even if Alex was unsure, he knew it meant something.
        However vague, however distant, he sensed it was a significant memory.
        Janie waited for her reward, unable to concentrate on anything else by
        then. 
      Alex bent down to kiss her neck, his nose nuzzling her ear as his fingers
        continued to rub and probe her sex. His cock was twitching, demanding
        to be nested in the warm and moist flesh where his fingers were. 
      &#147;Oh Jesus!&#148; Janie proclaimed with a burst of hot breath. &#147;Yes,
        yes, don&#146;t stop just yet.&#148; 
      He didn&#146;t stop. Completing the girl&#146;s pleasure was the least
        he could do in the circumstances.  
      Alex recalled Doctor Schmidt&#146;s instructions. They were explicit: &#145;Don&#146;t
        hesitate to use the third vial if the second shows any sign of releasing
        memories.&#146; 
      &#147;Can I have another drink of water?&#148; Janie asked, sighing
        with contentment. 
      Alex obliged.

        A HISTORY LESSON 
         
      &#147;Isla de la Plata has been in the same family&#146;s hands for
        six generations, ever since its settlement in 1830. Madame Cavallo inherited
        it from her father ten years ago following his death. The mining is almost
        finished now, but the Mistress has inherited a very large fortune from
        silver and other minerals... 
      &#147;There&#146;s a long history of slavery here, which continued throughout
        the twentieth century. Many of the buildings you see on this island were
        built by the original slaves - people from various southern Pacific islands.
        One day Madame&#146;s great-great-grandfather decided to grant the slaves
        their freedom. Most stayed on the island and continued to work hard for
        a modest wage and somewhere to live. But that era didn&#146;t last long.
        There was a protest and then a rebellion over the working conditions
        in the mine. Many slaves were killed before the rebellion was quashed... 
      &#147;That brought about the second period of slavery. It was a much
        harsher regime. The slaves lived their lives in chains and under the
        strictest supervision. That was the era when the women slaves were first
        used as human ponies. They were too weak for the heavy work, but when
        harnessed as a team were found to be adequate replacements for donkeys.
        The mining business flourished and expanded under Mistress&#146;s great
        grandfather. He acquired more and more slaves to meet the demand. It
        was he that started the breeding program, mating the strongest and healthiest
        men and women to produce all the slaves he needed... 
      &#147;These days, with so little mining activity, the island doesn&#146;t
        need many slaves, but Mistress retains a passionate interest in slavery
        and breeding, and ponygirls too.&#148; 
       Riccardo looked at the girl giving him the history lesson as they shared
        a morning coffee. Lucinda was pretty, and, he guessed, in her late teens.
        He&#146;d seen many beautiful women, but this one was unique, and he
        had been captivated by her appearance since he arrived on the island
        several days ago. 
      Lucinda wore a long white dress with a dramatically plunging neckline.
        The cloth had a gauzy lightness to the point of translucency, designed
        more to titillate the onlooker rather than protect her modesty. Her dress
        was complimented by roman sandals with white laces that criss-crossed
        up the lengths of her shins, knotting neatly just below the knees. Her
        wrists each sported half a dozen metal bangles that clinked musically
        as she moved to take a sip of coffee. But it was her neck that was most
        alluring. It was encased in what looked like bronze hoops, broad at her
        shoulders and narrowing towards the top of her neck. Her neck was unnaturally
        long, stretched by many years wearing the brass rings. Riccardo had seen
        tribal people wearing something similar, but never a white woman. 
      When he asked about her neck, Lucinda explained as she had many times
        before. &#147;I was born on this island. I&#146;m a product of its breeding
        program, and like the other babies I was sold immediately. Most babies
        ended up in wealthy homes in America, but I was sold to an organisation
        that trained sex slaves. At the age of ten, they put the first coil around
        my neck. Everybody said how beautiful I looked and that made me happy.
        People think they are hoops but it&#146;s a coil. The tradition comes
        from the Padaung of Burma... 
      &#147;Two years ago, Madame purchased me from the organisation which
        had reared and trained me. She paid quite a lot of money, I believe.
        My neck is eight inches long now, but Madame wants it to be eleven inches
        in the next five years. I don&#146;t think it&#146;s possible. It&#146;ll
        probably kill me.&#148; 
      Riccardo looked concerned. &#147;What happens if the coil is removed?
        Is it true you would die?&#148; he asked, admitting he knew little of
        the practice. 
      As she shook her head her large hoop earrings chimed softly against
        her bronze encased neck. &#147;No, but it would be a terrible strain.
        My neck muscles are very weak. It&#146;s better I stay like this. I&#146;m
        used to it. I like it!&#148; 
      Riccardo was more than a little aroused by Lucinda and her lifetime
        of bondage. Her charm was the equal of her looks - an attractive well-proportioned
        face with a slightly flat retrousse nose. He liked her dark brown hair
        too: Short but feminine, cut so as not obscure her neck&#146;s brass
        coil. But he was confused. Apart from her neck she gave no other indication
        of being a slave. He&#146;d seen her coming and going as she pleased.
        In fact, she seemed not to have a care in the world. 
      &#147;I&#146;m not a slave,&#148; Lucinda said defensively. &#147;I&#146;m
        owned by Madame, but that doesn&#146;t mean I&#146;m a slave does it?
        I&#146;m a possession, a curiosity, an ornament, she says. I&#146;m fully
        trained in oral and anal sex and in orgasm control and the erotic torment
        of female slaves. I&#146;m also an expert, they say, in hair and makeup.
        If you want to have sex with me, you can at tonight&#146;s Bacchanal.
        I&#146;ll be tied up and available to any man who wants me.&#148; 
      That category of man would certainly include Riccardo. &#147;So you do get
        tied up sometimes then?&#148; 
      &#147;Of course.&#148; Lucinda replied. &#147;Quite often, and always
        for sex, obviously.&#148; 
      Riccardo smiled. He was enjoying this conversation. &#147;Ever had sex
        without being tied up?&#148; he asked. 
      Lucinda shrugged her shoulders. &#147;No. never! I don&#146;t think
        I&#146;d like it so much without something to tug against.&#148; She
        leant forward, as if to confide in Riccardo. &#147;You know what I like
        the most?&#148; 
      He shook his head, giving the negative response she required. 
      &#147;...being chained to the four corners of a bed. Not too tight and
        not too loose.&#148; 
      &#147;Tight enough to tug against?&#148; Riccardo offered. 
      &#147;Exactly!&#148; Lucinda said with a broad smile. &#147;And I like
        it when a man kisses me... everywhere! Lots of tender kisses. And I like
        it when the weight of his chest is crushing my breasts... and when he
        kisses my lips.&#148; 
      Riccardo felt his penis swell within the infernal plastic tube he&#146;d
        worn since his arrival on the island. Tonight, being Friday, it would
        be removed. His male colleagues had told him that weekends were fun,
        but for him it had become a physical need rather than mere fun. Lucinda&#146;s
        comments weren&#146;t helping! 
      A distant rumble and whine of the railway tracks attracted Riccardo&#146;s
        attention. The Ponygirl Express was approaching. He looked at his watch,
        confirming they were right on schedule, as they always were. Jessica
        was still part of the foursome, Riccardo observed. His pledge to keep
        an eye on her was proving easy to keep. Two men disembarked from the
        Ponygirl Express, a woman got on, made herself comfortable, and pressed
        the green &#145;go&#146; button. If she cared to look closely she might
        have seen the twitchng of four leather-encased bodies as a low voltage
        shock was delivered into each ponygirl&#146;s rectum. 
      Smoothly and silently, Jessica and her team started to move; perfectly
        harnessed and perfectly trained to do their job. He was beginning to
        appreciate the impersonal and anonymous beauty of it. 
      Riccardo&#146;s gaze moved to his new ponygirl pair standing in harness
        just a few yards away behind Lucinda&#146;s back. The ponygirls, encased
        in their tight leatherbodies and hoods, were strong but poorly trained
        and unmotivated. Their hearts weren&#146;t in it, Riccardo concluded.
        They slouched and fidgeted, pulling against their harnessing in a most
        unflattering fashion. It might be understandable but it was certainly
        not acceptable. It reflected badly on Riccardo as a pony driver. 
      A couple of weeks of rigorous training, together with praise and encouragement
        would transform them. At least that was Riccardo&#146;s hope. They already
        understood punishment, the sting of the whip and the jolt of the anal
        prods, but that wasn&#146;t enough. They had to have the desire to be
        the best they could be. They should want to please their driver more
        than they care about their own comfort. He could make them better ponygirls,
        perhaps even bringing them up to competition standard. But first he needed
        to get to know them better, to learn how their ponygirl minds worked,
        what motivated and stimulated them, as well as what scared them. He was
        glad of the challenge for the month or two he expected to be away from
        Rabbit Island. 
      Lucinda knew what Riccardo was looking at over her shoulder but she
        showed little interest. To her, ponygirls were merely a form of transport.
        She&#146;d grown up around them. &#147;Have you ever driven a car?&#148; She
        asked Riccardo with child-like excitement. 
      The question caught him off guard. He returned his attention to his
        charming companion. &#147;Many times,&#148; he replied. 
      &#147;I haven&#146;t. I&#146;ve been in the back of a van once, but
        I was in a cage so I couldn&#146;t see anything,&#148; Lucinda said matter-of-factly,
        blissfully unaware of how bizarre her statement was. 
      They paused their conversation to watch a maid clearing cups from the
        neighbouring table. The woman wore an exaggerated French maid&#146;s
        black and white outfit, her waist impossibly nipped in, her breasts squeezed
        and thrust upwards into a balcony of flesh that could have supported
        one of the coffee cups. 
      Lucinda had mischief in her eyes. She called the waitress over to their
        table determined to torment Riccardo's libido even further. The waitress
        was beautifully made up, her black hair tied in a bun behind her. Riccardo
        caught sight of her long painted fingernails (which was something Riccardo
        appreciated but found somewhat lacking on Rabbit Island.) Lucinda lifted
        the waitress&#146;s skirt to show off her bare sex, framed by black garters
        and stocking tops. 
      Riccardo eyed the delights of the waitress&#146;s neatly trimmed bush
        and protruding labia. Lucinda ran her finger suggestively between them,
        trying perhaps to embarrass her. The waitress remained impassive. Lucinda
        seemed disappointed, waving her away to continue with her table duties. 
      &#147;She used to be a man!&#148; Lucinda whispered, with a childish
        delight in revealing a secret. 
      Riccardo shrugged. Transsexuals weren&#146;t that unusual these days.
        Perhaps Lucinda wasn&#146;t aware of that? 
      &#147;Madame was in a restaurant in New York last year. He was a waiter.
        Apparently he said something that caused Madame great offence. It was
        a terrible insult, they said. So she had him kidnapped... 
      &#147;They started to prepare him for his new life as a waitress. First
        they cut his vocal cords so now she can only whisper. They removed his
        lower ribs so the corset narrows his waist. He was put on a course of
        oestrogen and started to grow breasts, although most of the breasts are
        implants. After a year training him to be a maid, they did the operation.
        Then his male genitals were removed, but they didn&#146;t create a proper
        vagina. They just made it look that way from the outside... 
      &#147;So she can&#146;t have sex any more except in the anus. The men
        don&#146;t want her, but Brenda likes to use a strap-on with her. I watched
        them once. The waitress hated it, and cried the whole time, but Brenda
        reckons she enjoys it really!&#148; 
      Riccardo laughed nervously. &#147;So that&#146;s what happens if a man
        gets on the wrong side of Madame Cavallo? That&#146;s how she gets her
        revenge?&#148; 
      &#147;It&#146;s one of the ways!&#148; Lucinda said smugly. 
      Riccardo quickly slurped the dregs of his coffee and stood up. He really
        needed to get back to work! They exchanged a smiling goodbye, knowing
        their next encounter would be in the tumultuous atmosphere of the evening&#146;s
        Bacchanal. 
      DOG TIRED 
       
      Lucinda continued to sip her coffee, thinking dreamily of Riccardo,
      who she thought very handsome. She smiled on hearing his shout of &#145;hyaaa!&#146; as
      he whipped his ponygirls into motion. She tingled at the thought of his
      whip landing upon her... perhaps that very evening. 
       
      Some fifty yards in front of Lucinda was the so-called bitch training
        area. It was her job to fix the bitches&#146; faces so they looked their
        best on the video cameras that recorded their humiliation on the bitch
        frame. She watched as a handler led one of the bitches, crawling like
        a dog, back to the retaining wall. It was the bitch with the purple hair,
        Lucinda observed, a feisty bright-eyed girl that she felt strangely drawn
        to. 
      Kate was held on a short leash, which her handler tugged repeatedly,
        not so much to control her but to keep her moving. After her third morning
        session of submission on the bitch frame, her fight, her will to resist,
        had deserted her. Her head hung downwards as they reached the shaded
        area beside a brick wall. She crawled onto the padded mat which had become
        her home. The handler clipped her leash to the steel ring on the brick
        wall then untied the leather around her head which held the bone gag
        in her mouth. He wiped the gag dry of Kate&#146;s spittle and hung it
        a hook on the brick wall above her. 
      Yesterday she had fought with all her strength against being fixed to
        the bitch frame. The black and blue bruising on her thighs from the handlers&#146; kicks
        testified to the violence of the struggle, and to her inevitable defeat.
        Today she had gone to the frame like a lamb. Crawling on her hands and
        knees, she simply walked onto it knowing exactly where her hands and
        feet needed to be. She lifted her head and placed it onto the chin rest,
        lowering it carefully onto the nasty spike that dug into her flesh, dissuading
        any desire to move her head. The men busied themselves, strapping her
        ankles, knees, wrists, and the straps pulled tight across her back. Then
        the dog&#146;s pelt was thrown over her, velcro fastening around her
        arms and thighs. Finally there were those vicious serrated-edge nipple
        clamps, which pulled her breasts to the ground like inverted cones. How
        she hated those clamps! 
      Merely being strapped to that frame wasn&#146;t so bad for a girl who
        was familiar with bondage in all its perverted variety. If a man had
        taken her in such a position she might even have derived some pleasure
        from it. A man yes, but not a pack of dogs... at least not until that
        third time! 
      In retrospect, it had been foolish. She thought it would make her feel
        better if, while the dogs were rutting her, she took her mind off it
        by thinking of her more pleasant exploits on Rabbit Island. The memories
        of some bittersweet torments proved all too vivid. It took her mind off
        the canine assault rather too much. She forgot about the cameras trained
        on her. Cameras that recorded the blissful smile on her face as an orgasm
        rippled through her in a series of deep convulsions, constrained by leather,
        metal and the weight of a lusty slobbering great dane upon her back. 
      When the dogs were called off, Kate was left fixed on the bitch-frame
        for ten minutes or so. The tears of defeat etched salty wet lines down
        her cheeks. She hated herself, knowing that her shameful pleasure had
        been recorded. How they would be amused by her display of bestial submission!
        Perhaps they might decide that she preferred to remain in the company
        of dogs? 
      Kate lapped thirstily from her water bowl, balancing on her hands which
        had been balled into paw-like fists inside leather mitts. It had been
        three days since she had been able to stretch out her fingers. She sat
        back and pawed at the flat leather crotch strap that dissected her labia.
        The semen of dogs trickled out, sticking to her thighs just as it had
        for the last two days. 
      She would soon be asleep, dozing periodically through the day, like
        dogs usually do. The four bitches had a routine: They were to stand to
        attention (on all fours, of course) if a visitor arrived, so they took
        it in turns to act as the watchdog. It was the watchdog&#146;s duty to
        alert her dozing companions if anyone approached. Kate, as the most recently
        returned from the frame, was allowed to sleep while her neighbour kept
        a look out. 
       
        THE BANGKOK SLAVE TRADER 
        (Alex, Janie) 
      Alex&#146;s taxi pulled up outside a nondescript warehouse in the middle
        of a bustling industrial estate on the outskirts of Bangkok. It had to
        be the right place; the written instructions and the hand-drawn map were
        clear. Alex asked the driver to wait half an hour. He agreed, knowing
        that Americans were good tippers. 
      The building Alex entered was operating as a small but busy ironworks.
        Ornate fences and security gates for the city&#146;s well-to-do residents
        were its speciality. One of the workers, dressed in leather apron and
        gloves, escorted Alex to the back of the factory, then through several
        doors, leaving the drilling, banging and welding further and further
        behind. 
      &#147;Good morning Mister Alex!&#148; a man greeted him, with a beaming
        smile, his arms wide open as if expecting a hug. 
      Alex shook the Thai man&#146;s hand warming. &#147;Good morning, Charlie.
        It&#146;s very nice to see you. You&#146;ve moved again?&#148; 
      &#147;Yes, Mister Alex. Always keep on move. Always very careful. Now
        you check out my merchandise, I make nice green tea.&#148; 
      The merchandise, as Charlie always referred to it, was stored in a row
        of five cages in the centre of the almost empty warehouse. Each iron
        cage (made in the adjoining factory) stood on its own wooden pallet,
        ready to be forklifted to a customer at a moment&#146;s notice. 
      Inside the first cage a dark-skinned woman knelt, hands shackled behind
        her, ankles also in shackles, connected by a two-foot chain. She wore
        a leather collar with a chain leash that wrapped around a bar at the
        top her cage. It kept her kneeling upright, at attention and on display
        for visitors such as Alex. She glanced up at him just long enough to
        see who or what he was, then looked at the floor of her cage. It was
        not her fault she was here but she still felt a sense of shame. 
      &#147;She housemaid. Man have debts and sell her. Good worker. Look!
        She clean floor very good.&#148; 
      The grey painted concrete floor did indeed look spotless, Alex observed.
        His attention moved to the blonde girl in the next cage. 
      &#147;She Swedish!&#148; Charlie announced with reverence. He knew what
        a valuable acquisition she was. He unbolted and swung open the front
        door of the cage, unhooked the girl&#146;s leash from the bars, pulled
        her out and coaxed her to stand up. 
      &#147;Very excellent body,&#148; said Charlie, stating the blindingly
        obvious. Alex hadn&#146;t come to buy, but it seemed polite to cast an
        expert eye over Charlie&#146;s merchandise. 
      He was tempted to use another word. Perfect! She stood sideways to him
        so he could admire her profile. His eyes traced the line from her brow
        to her neat nose and elegant chin. Her breasts were fairly small but
        sagged not in the least, perfectly supported by her healthy and youthful
        frame. 
      &#147;Real blonde!&#148; said Charlie, tugging hard on the girl&#146;s
        pubic hair. She looked at Alex, still harbouring the hope that he might
        be there to rescue her. Perhaps he was just pretending to be a buyer?
        He seemed too nice, too sophisticated, to be a criminal. 
&#147;She&#146;s very quiet. Why&#146;s that?&#148; Alex asked. 
       
&#147;She gagged all yesterday. Too many noise. She not like gag. Now she quiet
like mouse.&#148; 
       
      &#147;Too much noise, not too many.&#148; Alex corrected him.
        The girl smiled coyly at his joking comment. Alex looked her in the eyes
        and asked Charlie: &#147;Is she submissive?&#148; 
      &#147;Of course she submissive! Look!&#148; Charlie tugged downwards
        on her leash. &#147;Slave girl don&#146;t look at Master!&#148; 
      Alex stood in front of her, close enough to embrace. His hands gripped
        her upper arms as he whispered in her ear. 
      Charlie watched as the girl variously nodded and shook her head in answer
        to Alex&#146;s unaudible questions. 
      Alex&#146;s enquiries were unsatisfactory. The girl seemed as vanilla
        as her hair. &#147;When&#146;s the auction?&#148; 
      &#147;Friday. You gonna bid?&#148; 
      &#147;I&#146;ll be back in the USA then, but I&#146;ll follow it on
        the Internet. Perhaps I&#146;ll bid. Send me an e-mail.&#148; 
      Charlie hustled the girl back into her cage. She knelt and backed into
        her iron-barred home. He wrapped her leash around the bars above her.
        Unless another visitor arrived she would spend the rest of the day in
        her enforced kneeling position. Only when the factory had closed its
        doors would the leash be unhooked so she could lie down. 
      Charlie ran a strict regime, honed from a decade in the business. He
        never damaged the merchandise, in fact they were likely to leave him
        in better condition than they arrived. A few yards away from the cages
        was his camp bed. His was a twenty-four hour job. There was a box of
        vegetables and cases of bottled water. On a table was a portable gas
        stove where he would cook supper for his girls. There was an exercise
        bike to retain the fitness of his long-term residents, and a portable
        television for the evenings - a welcome distraction for captor and captives
        alike. 
      They moved to the next cage and another Thai girl - clearly a teenager.
        Tears stained her cheeks. 
      &#147;Virgin. I check her. You like virgin?&#148; 
      She looked up at Alex with her lustrous doe eyes, too innocent to be
        ashamed, too na&#239;ve to fully comprehend the horrors that awaited
        her. It had been a couple of years since Alex had taken a virgin and
        the prospect of having that soft and sweet Asian girl laying bound and
        trembling in his bed appealed very much. Perhaps another time, he promised
        himself. 
      &#147;That is whore,&#148; Charlie said with a dismissive wave at the
        next cage. He poured the tea while Alex studied her. &#147;Ten years
        in same whorehouse. Now she too old. They give her to me free. Need drugs
        but I don&#146;t give her. I told her drugs bad. She go cold chicken.&#148; 
      Alex reached into the cage to stroke her hair. To him, every woman had
        something of interest, something unique about her. She trembled and sweated,
        fidgeting as if desperate to move from her enforced kneeling position;
        a picture of misery her fellow prisoners could not match. Her enslavement
        to opiates was far more harmful than one of Charlie&#146;s cages. Alex
        was inordinately proud of the health of the Rabbit Island residents and
        if circumstances were different he might have considered having the unwanted
        whore shipped to Rabbit Island. There was always work to be done on the
        farm. He suspected Charlie would be glad to have her off his hands as
        long as costs were covered. Alas, with Rabbit Island closed, he had to
        leave her to an uncertain fate. 
      The last of the five cages was the reason for Alex&#146;s visit. Janie
        looked up at him with bright and alert eyes, moaning loudly into her
        ballgag as if she had something urgent to say. She seemed more alert
        and alive than when he had interviewed her in the hospital. She now realised
        that Alex was the instigator of her kidnapping and caging, yet she was
        still glad to see him. She felt she could talk to him, or at least she
        could if Charlie hadn&#146;t gagged her. 
      &#147;Why you want girl without arms?&#148; Charlie asked Alex. 
      &#147;She has information. I feared she might kill herself before I
        could get it. Any problems taking her?&#148; 
      &#147;She walk near road as you say. Easy to take her in dark, but we
        don&#146;t know how tie up her. No arms see? Very funny!&#148; Charlie
        chuckled at the memory. 
      With no memories of her past, Janie had little sense of normality. For
        all she knew, being kidnapped and locked in a cage was something that
        happened to all women. 
      &#147;She very noisy! Talk a lot. Gag better but still noisy,&#148; Charlie
        complained wagging his finger at Janie. 
      Alex gave a sarcastic and joking apology. He knew Charlie could silence
        her completely were it necessary. 
      &#147;And other thing. She masturbate. Bad girl!&#148; 
      Alex laughed. &#147;What do you mean? How the hell can she masturbate?&#148;  
      &#147;I show you.&#148; 
      Alex sipped his tea while Charlie went behind Janie&#146;s cage. He
        untied a rope running between the back bars and her ankle chain. He&#146;d
        tied it to prevent her bringing her feet in front. &#147;Now you show
        Mister Alex your masturbate!&#148; 
      Janie&#146;s eyes went wide with horror. Charlie banged threateningly
        on the bars with his trusty wooden cane. &#147;Come, no arm girl. We
        waiting!&#148; 
      With her knees splayed wide Janie bent her ankles inwards to her things.
        A further shimmy on her buttocks brought her right heel hard against
        her sex. Her left heel pushed against her right toes holding the right
        heel hard against her mound. She had strong yet shapely ankles, Alex
        thought, well suited to the shiny silver cuffs and links that encircled
        them. 
      &#147;Then what do you do?&#148; He asked. Being gagged, Janie guessed
        that a verbal explanation wasn&#146;t what they required. She would have
        to demonstrate while the two men looked on. Her heel started rubbing
        up and down on her labia. Her face flushed red with embarrassment as
        dribble from her ballgagged lips splattered on her feet. She glanced
        sheepishly up to Alex - surely he didn&#146;t expect her to do it right
        there! 
      &#147;Would it help if I squeezed your breasts?&#148; Alex asked considerately. 
      After a pause of deliberation she nodded. She knew it would help a great
        deal.  
      &#147;Charlie, get me a pair of nipple clamps.&#148; said Alex, his
        eyes remaining fixed on Janie. 
      Charlie dipped into his wooden box of tricks. &#147;Hard, soft or toothbite?&#148; 
      &#147;We&#146;ll see how she gets on with soft,&#148; Alex replied.
        He squatted in front of the cage and gestured with his finger for Janie
        to lean towards the bars. She obeyed to the extent that her leashed collar
        allowed. Alex reached into the cage to touch her breasts. Janie closed
        her eyes as he tenderly toyed with her nipples. At first she didn&#146;t
        feel the clamp, confusing its pressure with Alex&#146;s fingers.  
      Alex took advantage of her submission, wrapping the chain around one
        of the vertical bars and clamping the other nipple. It felt nice to be
        touched like that, but he was pinching them too hard, Janie thought.
        Then she opened her eyes to see Alex standing up. He&#146;d tricked her!
        She panicked, leaning back, squirming from side to side to try to release
        her breasts, but the collar and chain, the elasticity of her breasts
        and the implacable grip of the clamp made it impossible. 
      &#147;Try it now,&#148; Alex said. 
      Janie&#146;s slightest movement tugged on her clamped nipples, whilst
        bigger movements made it seem like someone was pulling at her breasts.
        The chain linking the clamps rattled and scraped across the vertical
        bars. She pulled back again, feeling the pain and pleasure on her nipples.
        Soon her heel was rubbing up and down her labia. 
      Alex pulled up a wooden stool and sat in front of the cage. &#147;Now
        be a good girl and show me how you masturbate. You&#146;ve nothing to
        be ashamed of.&#148; 
      Janie obeyed. She still thought of him as the doctor, a figure of authority.
        She wanted so much for him to touch her again. Perhaps he would if she
        pleased him by doing as he asked? 
      Alex was beginning to doubt if Janie could complete the act. Her legs
        ached. She had to stop and stretch out her leg periodically, as if to
        prevent a cramp. He took Charlie aside. &#147;Every evening you must
        fix her like this and allow her to practice masturbating. And you must
        tickle her too.&#148; 
      Charlie was puzzled. &#147;Tiku?&#148; 
      &#147;Like this!&#148; 
      Alex was too quick for him, digging his fingers into the flesh beneath
        Charlie&#146;s ribs. Charlie jumped back to safe distance. He laughed,
        waving a karate chop hand in Alex&#146;s direction. 
      &#147;Here. I&#146;ll show you.&#148; Alex said, bending down to Janie.
        He reached into the cage with both hands. She was helpless as Alex&#146;s
        cruel fingers assaulted her ribs and belly for a minute or more. She
        struggled for breath behind the gag, making garbled pleas for mercy that
        went unheeded. 
      By the time Alex relented, Janie was a dribbling wreck, exhausted, tickled
        into submission, yet somehow she felt better than she had since... quite
        literally she didn&#146;t know when. As Alex explained to her that he
        would be away for a few weeks, the thrill of his touch faded. Only the
        promise of his return saved her from despair. 
      &#147;Now, that&#146;s a true submissive!&#148; Alex explained to Charlie
        as they walked away from the cages. 
      &#147;You still have New York girls I take from Bangkok airport last
        year?&#148; Charlie asked as he escorted Alex out of the factory. 
      Alex had to think for a moment, then his stomach sank. Nancy! Her escape
        from Rabbit Island was part of the reason for the Island&#146;s closure,
        though nobody knew what had happened to her. And what about Jessica?
        At least she was safe and secure. He had confidence that Riccardo would
        be watching over Rabbit Island&#146;s valuable possessions. He didn&#146;t
        thank Charlie for the reminder of the chaos on Rabbit Island. So many
        friends and loyal slaves temporarily dispersed around the world. The
        next three weeks of business commitments in America would seem like a
        lifetime. 
      On Alex&#146;s instructions the taxi stopped at a private hospital.
        Ray, the pony driver, was recovering from the accident that had left
        him needing surgery on a fractured skull. He had told Alex the previous
        day that he didn&#146;t intend to return to Rabbit Island. It seemed
        a good time to make the break, he explained. Alex understood. He was
        the first to pronounce that there was more to life than living on a small
        island in the South Pacific. He offered to use his wide connections to
        help Ray obtain a similar position in Europe, recognising the importance
        of keeping good people within the fold. Secrecy and discretion were everything
        in the world of luxury sexual slavery! Skilled and reliable pony drivers
        weren&#146;t easy to come by. Alex pondered whether his associate in
        London might be interested in exchanging a member of his staff. 
      The men said their goodbyes with promises to talk by phone. Alex allowed
        his hospital visitor&#146;s smile to droop as he returned to his taxi.
        Waiting beside the taxi were two policemen casually talking to the driver,
        all three smoking cigarettes. One of the policemen quickly stubbed his
        out underfoot. 
      &#147;Dr. Alex Kundera?&#148; 
      &#147;That&#146;s me.&#148; Alex said coolly. 
      &#147;We need to ask you some questions. Will you please come with us?
        It will not take long.&#148; 
      Alex shrugged his shoulders and smiled. &#147;Sure. No problem!&#148;

RICCARDO&#146;S RELEASE
(Riccardo, Brenda)

Riccardo had almost become lost in the labyrinthian corridors of La Plata&#146;s Town Hall before finally stumbling upon the room to which he had been directed. Waiting inside was Brenda, two hundred pounds of pure dyke, wearing her usual ill-fitting dungarees and a white tee shirt. Accompanying Brenda was a skinny girl with short hair and glasses. She also favoured dungarees. It so happened that their sartorial preference was also their official uniform.
Madame Cavallo liked uniforms. She even called the tight leather coverings of the ponygirls their &#145;uniform&#146;. Luckily for Riccardo, the dress code for pony drivers was just a black polo shirt, long khaki shorts and a baseball-style cap complete with a La Plata embroidered badge. 
He had also been issued with a multi-function belt, which he quite liked. It contained: a combination flashlight and nightstick. A compact first aid kit. A small tazer gun. A deluxe Swiss army knife, complete with that thing for taking stones out of ponygirls&#146; hooves. Handcuffs, even though he rarely came across any females not already secured. A short whip, suitable for small admonishments. He&#146;d used it frequently on his ponygirls in the last few days.
There was one other item of uniform. He most definitely didn&#146;t like it: The cock restraint! The clear perspex penis tube curtailed erections and shielded his penis from manual manipulations. It had successfully prevented him from obtaining any form of sexual relief for the last five days. Riccardo&#146;s testicles felt full to bursting, and the perspex loop at their root had become more and more restrictive and uncomfortable. 
The visit to Brenda would solve his problem. It was her job on Friday evenings to remove the male chastity devices from the pony drivers and other male workers. 
Brenda looked at him, her hands on her ample hips. She tutted. &#147;Drop your pants, stupid!&#148;
Riccardo ignored the insult. He wasn&#146;t going to react when she literally held the key to his much anticipated release from chastity. He unbuckled his belt and let his shorts and underwear fall to the floor around his feet.
This was Brenda&#146;s second favourite part of the week. The feeling of power over men was intoxicating even if she didn&#146;t find it sexually stimulating. She handed the skinny sidekick the key. Nervously, without looking up at him, the skinny one unlocked the small padlock that connected the penis tube and base ring together. Riccardo&#146;s cock gave an involuntary twitch as the girl&#146;s slender fingers fumbled with the key and the lock. She pulled the device clear before it could spurt at her. Showing evident distaste she held the chastity device between thumb and forefinger and placed it in a small tray labelled with Riccardo&#146;s name.
&#147;Sunday evening at seven, you return here for refitting,&#148; Brenda instructed with thinly disguised glee. That was, of course, her favourite part of the week.



THE BACCHANAL
(Kate)
The Main Hall was a bright and functional space slightly larger that a basketball court. Judging by the myriad of coloured lines painted on the wooden floor it was used for a variety of indoor sports.As Riccardo entered the hall, this evening&#146;s sport was all too apparent. It was just as Peter had enthusiastically described to him in the preceding days. Scattered around the floor, naked women waited. As each was thoroughly hogtied with a vast amount of rope, that was all they could do. For up to two hours some of them had been held in such contorted shapes, their physical comfort was far down the list of priorities as other preparations for the Bacchanal were made.
Riccardo picked a circuitous path between the women. Some looked up at him, dribbling from their ballgags, eyes in a pleading frown as if to say &#147;rape me, beat me, do anything but please untie me.&#148; He recognised a few of the women but most were new to him. Rachel, from Rabbit Island, was amongst them, almost unrecognisable with her close-cropped blonde hair. Instinctively he looked around for Kate, but didn&#146;t spot her. Then, to his surprise and delight, he saw Lucinda. Her roped hogtie was as strict as any other. Her open palms cradled her ankles, elbows wedged together in such a way that it made her appear double-jointed. Ropes encircled and harnessed her body, with several strands splitting her crotch. Her copper wound neck prevented her from craning up at him as the other women did. He pitied her, but he desired her more. He wasn&#146;t exactly sure how the evening was arranged but if he had a choice, then it would be Lucinda. He assumed every other man felt the same way about her so was pessimistic about his chances.
 He made his way to the far end of the hall where the large group of men was engrossed in a particular task - an enjoyable one, yet a serious one, judging by their good-humoured concentration.
&#147;Riccardo. Come over here!&#148; one of the men called out.
He saw what and who was the focus of their attention. Lying stretched out upon a cross, tied to it at every possible point, was a woman&#146;s body. Not just tied but nailed as well. Her feet rested on a wooden support that obliged her knees to be splayed open. Shiny nails pierced through the top of each foot and into the wood. Blood trickled from each wound, though not as much as Riccardo expected. Looking at her face, Riccardo was horrified to recognise Kate.
A moment after that recognition came the sharp &#145;ching&#146; of a hammer hitting a nail. It had gone through her right hand. A couple more taps fixed the nail firmly into the wood.
Kate sobbed, pleading for the men not to do this to her. One man knelt with his thighs on either side of her head. The victims tended to faint if they were allowed to see what was happening. Riccardo was surprised that Kate wasn&#146;t crying out in agony, despite her obvious distress.
Somebody thrust the hammer into his hand. &#147;The last one is yours. Call it an initiation!&#148;
Riccardo was in a daze, caught up in a testosterone-fuelled fervour. The restriction on his sexual energies over the last week had emboldened him in a way he couldn&#146;t have imagined. The feel of the hammer and nail in his hands brought about a startling arousal.
&#147;Don&#146;t worry, she won&#146;t feel a thing,&#148; the man reassured him. &#147;She&#146;s had a local anaesthetic! I&#146;ll hold the nail in the right place, and you hit it hard, but watch out for my fingers!&#148;
The man stretched out Kate&#146;s fingers which were curled defiantly into her palm. Her wrist and elbow were tightly bound with rope holding her arm fast to the wood. Riccardo looked at the hand, so small and soft, a delicate feminine hand; such a contrast to the nail pressing against it: bright stainless steel, five inches long, with a point as sharp as a needle. It already indented the flesh between Kate&#146;s index and middle fingers, giving the impression that it could simply be pushed through her flesh  Kate whimpered in dreadful anticipation just as Riccardo made a decisive blow bringing the hammer down squarely onto the nail&#146;s head. It struck the wood. He hit it twice more while blood oozed from the nail&#146;s wound.
Having quickly satisfied themselves that Riccardo&#146;s hammer blows had been successful, the group of men stood clear. Somebody pulled Riccardo by the arm away from Kate&#146;s crucified body as the cross started to lift. The bottom was hinged to the floor whilst the top was fixed to a rope and pulley descending from the ceiling. 
Slowly the cross was hauled upright. Kate&#146;s body barely shifted when it reached the vertical, such was the thoroughness of the ropework. From her vantage-point of around ten feet high she had a full view of the hall, looking down on the fifteen hogtied women. She was in a morphine-induced dream. Although nailed to a cross, she couldn&#146;t feel her wounds, only the ropes digging into her torso. These ropes took her whole weight.
The hall lights dimmed to be replaced by coloured lighting that resembled a discotheque. A rotating mirrored ball gave the darkened hall a shimmering movement. Music, electronic and rhythmic played unobtrusively in the background, loud enough to create atmosphere but not to disguise the noises of the hall&#146;s occupants. The simultaneous lights dimming and the music starting was the signal. The floor was suddenly alive with activity. Men had swarmed upon the hogtied women in a frenzy, whilst the women grunted, impatient for their impending release. Kate smiled softly from above, thinking that her dream, perhaps her final dream, was taking place beneath her.
After a week of denial, the men were desperate to relieve their pent up lust. As soon as the first woman was released from her hogtie she was tied over an A-frame. Another found herself crouching on  a bitch-frame similar to the one Kate had experienced during the preceding few days. Soon the wall frames and many other fixings were occupied by the female participants. With little preamble or finesse the men set upon them. Sometimes a queue formed for a girl in a position that took their fancy. That was how Riccardo obtained his first relief. The thought of Kate attached to the frame for the benefit of dogs had played relentlessly on his mind for several days, now was his chance to act on that niggling urge. He knelt down behind the girl, dropped his shorts, and crudely fucked the girl on the bitch-frame.
The mood changed as the initial burst of activity subsided. At the side of the hall was a well-stocked bar where beer, wine and spirits were freely available. Riccardo gratefully took a bottle of German lager thrust into his hand by the barman. Having completed the nailing initiation. Riccardo was treated as a very welcome new member of their gang. He tried to act casual when he asked about Kate, or &#145;the girl on the cross&#146; as he described her. &#145;She&#146;ll be fine!&#148; the answer came back from several men.
Riccardo swigged the ice-cold beer and looked around the hall. Playtime was well under way: the sound of whips cracking and the accompanying cries filled the air. Men laughed, and women too. One woman was strung up by her arms and being subjected to the shocks of a violet wand. Riccardo went, bottle in hand, to watch and perhaps participate. He glanced up at Kate, but she didn&#146;t notice him. Her eyes seemed glazed, her expression one of drug-induced contentment. To his surprise, instead of pity, he felt lust. Kate&#146;s splayed knees meant her clean-shaven sex was tantalisingly displayed an arm&#146;s reach above him.
A ballgag might be visually appealing, but is not totally effective at silencing a woman. Riccardo could swear somebody was calling his name, or at least its three vowels. He&#146;d almost forgot about Lucinda amidst the general debauchery. She was one of several women still hogtied and apparently neglected. Riccardo sat on the floor next to her and did what he wanted to do since he first met her, running his finger up and down her copper neck bands. He had always had a thing for slender female necks, whether bare, collared or covered. This particular neck was the longest and most slender he would ever see... except that he would never see it. The thought of Lucinda&#146;s perpetual neck bondage was something he found to be deeply erotic.
Lucinda was effusive in her gratitude when Riccardo finally removed her gag. She was glad it was him, she said, although Riccardo had long since learned not to be swayed by such flattery. He wasn&#146;t in a hurry to untie her ropes, not until he had decided what to do next. In any case, he observed that she did not appear to be in any discomfort. She explained that she&#146;d been bound in hogties for many years, ever since she was a young child. Riccardo winced at her words. He loved children in the best sense of the word, and still harboured the hope that one day he might have a family. The thought of abusing a child repulsed him.
After a tedious and frustrating ten minutes of untying knots (which they had intentionally made difficult) Riccardo was able to lead the stiff-limbed Lucinda to the device he had chosen for her - the iron spider. This was a simple wrought iron device consisting of two fifteen-inch bars, crossed and welded together. At the four ends of the bars were leather cuffs for wrists and ankles. It was commonly used as a secure and safe hogtying device, but had a variety of other applications. The one Riccardo enjoyed was already set up. The spider was dangling from the ceiling by a heavy chain (its appearance in this fashion accounted for its name) so that it hung three feet clear of the floor. Lucinda lay on her back and submitted willingly as Riccardo fixed her wrists and ankles into the four leather cuffs. It left her  with her limbs pointing upwards. Comfortable enough, but open and vulnerable, and ready for play!
Riccardo went to the bar to pick up another beer for himself and something for Lucinda. The barman cordially recommended a ginger fig to go with the slipover blindfold and a leather paddle. Riccardo watched as the barman ripped a node from a hand of ginger. With rapid chops of a knife on a wooden cutting board, the ginger was stripped of its skin and expertly shaped into a small butt-plug.
&#147;Wash your hands after you insert it!&#148; the barman advised Riccardo as he placed the ginger plug on the tray with the beer, the paddle and the blindfold.
&#147;Oh, no!&#148; said Lucinda as Riccardo put down the tray beside her. She&#146;d smelt the ginger and knew all too well its purpose and effect. &#147;I thought you were going to...&#148;
&#147;...fuck you?&#148; Riccardo offered. &#147;No. I&#146;m going to punish you for teasing me earlier today. Perhaps after your paddling I may allow you some pleasure.&#148; He pushed the narrow ginger plug into her ass. Her sphincter gripped the narrow part, holding it in position. Using his fingernails like claws Riccardo dug into her buttocks. Lucinda squirmed in delicious agony, squeezing down on the plug.
Riccardo warmed to his task with the paddle. The equanimity and poise Lucinda exhibited earlier when first fixed into the spider evaporated as the stinging heat of the ginger took effect. The paddle struck on her buttocks and the backs of her upturned thighs with a resounding &#145;whomp&#146; that earned Riccardo the admiration of those around him. He was entering into the spirit of the evening, enjoying the social alcohol-lubricated conversation. Another man took control of Lucinda while some of Riccardo&#146;s newfound friends took him around the hall and introduced him to the other staff. He was getting to like the place!
One of the men pointed up to the open gallery at the opposite end of the hall from Kate&#146;s cross. Madame Cavallo waved from her grandstand view and beckoned him to visit her. Riccardo was shown to the narrow staircase that led to Cavallo&#146;s eyrie.
The view was spectacular - quite literally. It was a spectacle laid on for Cavallo&#146;s pleasure. Kate was spot-lit from beneath, giving her an almost mystical aura as light and dark accentuated her body&#146;s shape. It took a minute for Riccardo to fully absorb all the action taking place beneath him. He was shocked, yet delighted, to have been part of such a show!
&#147;Riccardo, my dear, come and sit down and chat to me!&#148; Cavallo&#146;s called out warmly. She&#146;d been impressed by his attitude in the last week, and even more with his participation in the crucifixion and subsequent activities. &#147;I think you&#146;re already one of the boys!&#148; she ventured.
Madame Cavallo wasn&#146;t alone in her private gallery. She had two visitors - an elegantly dressed middle-aged couple, who were understandably more interested in the action below than in Riccardo. Cavallo showed good manners in introducing them all, but they were no more likely to remember Riccardo&#146;s name than he would theirs.
There were seven wooden seats on the balcony. Needless to say Cavallo was in the middle. The couple sat to her left so Riccardo sat down on her right. The chairs were made of heavy maple, plain yet elegant in design. They did however have one particular adornment that Riccardo couldn&#146;t fail to spot: Kneeling in front of each chair was a naked woman facing the chair&#146;s occupant. They were each fixed to the front of their seats by leather collars and six-inch chains. Riccardo hoisted his leg carefully over the head of the woman and sat down, his thighs kept open by her head and shoulders between them.
She was a redhead, and very pretty, Riccardo thought, with her hair gathered into a cute topknot. He looked down to see that her wrists and ankles were loosely chained behind her. The chains clinked a little as she adjusted her position between Riccardo&#146;s thighs. It was her front however that attracted most of his attention. Her breasts were large, although that in itself wasn&#146;t unusual given the island&#146;s lactation program. Yet it wasn&#146;t even her breasts that caused such fascination, it was her belly.
He looked in amazement at Madame Cavallo. &#147;She&#146;s pregnant!&#148;
&#147;Eight months,&#148; Cavallo confirmed with a smile. &#147;They&#146;re all in the late stages of pregnancy, that&#146;s why they&#146;re up here on oral duty. You don&#146;t think I&#146;d risk them down there do you?&#148;
Riccardo looked along the row of seven chairs. All of them, including the empty ones, were fronted by heavily-pregnant women. The two women to Riccardo&#146;s right continued facing straight ahead at their vacant chairs as they had been trained, though their eyes dared a sidelong look at him. They were jealous of Riccardo&#146;s redhead. Kneeling in chains in front of an unoccupied wooden chair was boring, boring, boring.
&#147;We make fifty thousand dollars a pop, if you&#146;ll excuse the pun.&#148; Cavallo boasted. &#147;Do you know I have more adoptive families waiting than I can satisfy. I have a private clinic in Los Angeles that collects from only the very best male specimens, handsome, healthy and intelligent. Here on La Plata we impregnate our breeders to produce babies to order. Your one&#146;s carrying her seventh.&#148;
The redhead leaned her cheek against Riccardo&#146;s inner thigh like a dog seeking attention from its owner. Despite her long-term sexual slavery, there was an elegance and intelligence in her face, while her body bloomed with good health. She was the kind of woman any man would want to breed with. She was the mother of many beautiful children she would never see.
The pregnant woman stationed at Cavallo&#146;s chair had her head and shoulders covered by Cavallo&#146;s black taffeta evening dress. Judging by the little movements in the fabric Madame Cavallo was receiving some intimate attention. &#147;Don&#146;t you just love our Friday evening?&#148; Cavallo rhetorically asked Riccardo. She looked at the debauchery in full flow below them with a beaming smile. &#147;Men are such cruel brutes!&#148;
The redhead had started nuzzling Riccardo&#146;s penis with her nose. This wasn&#146;t merely for duty&#146;s sake, she was enjoying it. After all, there was nothing else to amuse her. An erection was growing beneath his shorts which only encouraged the redhead further.
&#147;Just pull her by her hair if you want more or less attention.&#148; Cavallo advised, giving Riccardo a dilemma. He wanted more attention, a lot more, but not while he sat next to Madame Cavallo. He cursed his bad luck.
&#147;The one on the cross is our new breeder,&#148; Cavallo informed him, confirming something Riccardo had already learned through the rumour mill, &#147;just as soon we get her ovulating again. That Rabbit Island contraceptive treatment is such a hindrance. She hasn&#146;t had a pregnancy before. The new breeders always need a lot more care and attention than the experienced ones. I&#146;m sure she&#146;ll be fine once we get her started. A pretty thing, isn&#146;t she?&#148;
Riccardo gazed the twenty yards across the hall to Kate, her body seemed on fire, lit by the red lamps pointing up from the floor. He agreed with Cavallo. Even nailed to a cross she was pretty. In fact, gazing at her from that vantage-point, Riccardo lusted after her like never before.



SACRILEGE!
(Kate)

Having had her chat with her new boy, Cavallo allowed Riccardo to return to the Bacchanal. The redhead had left him horny and ready for more action. There was plenty to choose from. He walked past a woman who had been chained to a table, a motorised fucking machine had been pumping a dildo into her for twenty minutes. The long and relentless stroke had left her in the throws of yet another orgasm, this time witnessed only by Riccardo. The other men had moved on to other activities leaving the girl to her solitary mechanical rape.
Kate had been on the cross for two hours unaware that she was providing the visual centrepiece to the evening&#146;s festivities. Except for the dildo on a long stick that a man would occasionally apply around and into her sex, she was mostly ignored. The men concentrated on those females that could give them the satisfaction they needed.
Even while the Bacchanal continued, the soft swirling lighting and electronic music continuing to hold the mood, men began to lower the cross to the floor. The winch slackened the cable and the cross slowly travelled the ninety degree angle until Kate lay flat on the floor.Riccardo and others looked down at her nailed and tied body. The two men responsible for crucifixions appeared happy. She seemed in good shape. Riccardo thought so too. He was filled with an overwhelming desire, physical and emotional, towards Kate. If ever he saw another crucifixion it would not be Kate, nor would it compare to her. The other men gave Riccardo the go-ahead he wanted. His pulse raced as he bent down to caress her.&#147;Hello Riccardo,&#148; Kate said in a weak and otherworldly voice. &#147;They crucified me.&#148;
She tried to look around, but all she could see were the strange coloured patterns of lights on the ceiling. She was bewildered. &#147;Am I dead?&#148;
Riccardo tenderly stroked her face. &#147;No Katie, you&#146;re not dead. You&#146;re going to be fine. It&#146;s just a ritual.&#148;
&#147;My hands and feet are hurting,&#148; she croaked, her throat dry with thirst. She sensed Riccardo moving closer as if to kiss her. She felt his firm warm hands upon her breasts. &#147;Are you going to fuck me?&#148;
Riccardo nodded. &#147;Yes I am.&#148;
&#147;That&#146;ll be nice!&#148; Kate replied, trying to smile. She closed her eyes. &#147;I would like that very much.&#148;He pulled down his shorts, stripped off his tee shirt and carefully climbed on top of her. With her knees splayed open and feet nailed so the soles almost faced each other, Kate could do nothing to resist his advance even if she had wanted to.  Riccardo let his weight rest upon her tightly tied belly and breasts, enjoying the sensation of her nipples against his chest. He kissed her on the lips - not something he often did. Kate mustered up the energy to respond, her lips straining to reach his as if discovering that his mouth contained a restorative elixir. She let out the sweetest sound as he penetrated her. Each tender thrust brought a delightful little moan from her. Riccardo couldn&#146;t help himself - his hands reached out to find hers, his fingers touching the cruel nails that pierced them. He held onto them, as if he too were crucified.



THE PONYGIRL PADLOCKSJessica lay back on her bed. She sighed with boredom, not tired enough to sleep. Hanging from hooks on the wall was her tack - the leatherbody, the harness, neckbraces and, of course, her ponyboots. She had cleaned until everything shone. After four days of her attentions, the leatherbody was in better condition than when she was first given it. At least the leather polishing occupied her time!
She&#146;d heard about the Bacchanal, and knew it was the only place to be on a Friday night. As a result, the stable block was eerily quiet as the men had all departed for their evening of fun, and perhaps some of the ponygirls too, Jessica suspected. She felt lonely and ignored. The hairline scab below her breast where Master Alex carved his initial had almost disappeared. She picked at it, determined that it should not heal and fade.
Then Jessica remembered something that had almost slipped her mind. The typed sheet of paper with her cleaning instructions had a paperclip at the top. She retrieved it and straightened out the first bend, leaving the remainder to act like a handle. She dragged it across the three lines of the A, satisfied to see droplets of blood had formed. It made her feel stronger, more in charge of her own body. She looked down her naked body to the small padlocks between her legs. The first one passed directly through two labia piercings. She&#146;d worn it since her arrival on La Plata nearly a week ago. The second padlock linked her labia lock to a five-foot length of chain connecting her to the wall opposite.
Her heart thumped with anticipation as if it were a key in her hand rather than merely a paperclip. She jiggled the paperclip into the keyhole, just toying with it. To pass the time, she told herself. Where could she go even if she did manage to pick the lock? It was a slave island, and when they were caught escaped slaves were severely punished. Everyone knew that!
Jessica&#146;s efforts were having a side-effect - she felt herself getting warm, her pulse quickening, as her hands pressed and rubbed against her sex while she tried in vain to pick the lock. Her fingers probed her moistening folds. It felt good. It felt comforting, a brief respite from her loneliness. The lock would have to wait as she trembled and panted towards a release of a different kind.



BANGKOK AIRPORTAlex waited in the business lounge for his flight back to New York. Even at the best of times there is a kind of desolation that comes from waiting in airport lounges. One never gets used to it. Any sense of the exotic, or of adventure, had disappeared decades ago. Now the waiting, in what purports to be luxurious surroundings, brings on a bout of self-examination that an eminent psychologist like Alex Kundera should not indulge in.The police hadn&#146;t detained Alex for long. They informed him that their investigation of the disappearance of armless girl (as they persisted in calling Janie) had led nowhere. Several times they apologized that his research visit had been so sadly curtailed. Alex graciously conceded that they were not at fault. They had done all they could to discover Janie&#146;s whereabouts. They would, of course, notify him when they found her. Their meaning was apparent: given her well-documented suicidal state they fully expected to find a dead body.
Alex sipped his brandy and dug into his breast pocket for the letter the police gave him. It was a miracle it had reached him, the policeman said, and a testament to the efficiency of their organisation, he implied.
He opened the letter, and was surprised by its crude handwriting. Barely legible and evidently written by someone with a limited grasp of English, its purpose was nevertheless clear. It was a ransom note for Nancy. Contrary to every expectation she had not made the safety of the American consulate after her escape. Alex pondered the significance of the note. The only reason he would be the recipient was if there was an expectation that he was willing to pay to Nancy her back to Rabbit Island. That could only have come at her instigation. In which case, from what he knew of Nancy, it had to be a last resort.
He pocketed the letter and gathered his possessions, glad that he had didn't have checked-in baggage. At the customer services desk he asked to be removed from his flight.

      (Ch. 18) The Bacchanal. Crucifixion 
       
       Three weeks had elapsed since Kate&#8217;s crucifixion. Underneath
        gauze bandages on her hands and feet her wounds were healing well; but
        the memory of that night on the cross - when she truly thought she would
        die - was seared into her.  
       Her breasts had grown larger during those three weeks, much larger,
        filling out skimpy white lace dress she wore. It was the cowgirls&#8217; uniform:
        a pretty sleeveless lacy white dress with an obscenely short hemline
        that never quite covered her buttocks. No other clothing was permitted
        or required, unless one counts the heavy leather belt slung loosely around
        her waist. The natural tan of the leather offset the pure white of her
        dress peculiarly well, accentuating her hips in a manner befitting an
        occupant of the breeding shed. The belt also served as the securing point
        for her prisoner&#8217;s chains. Handcuffs were linked by a long chain
        to her ankle shackles, the chain passing through a heavy metal ring on
        the back of her belt. She&#8217;d been secured that way since her arrival. 
       For most of the day she remained fixed to a milking frame. It was an
        efficient method of keeping Kate and the others under control, or &#8216;out
        of trouble&#8217; as the dairy workers would put it. 
       The frame did at least give its occupant degree of comfort. Its well-padded
        bars supported Kate from belly to neck, holding her torso parallel to
        the ground, breasts hanging downwards, within the loose dress. Her legs
        were in a kneeling position, held slightly apart by crude metal fixings
        around her ankles, just in case her existing ankle shackles weren&#8217;t
        enough of a restriction. Her neck was surrounded by a steel loop on the
        frame which condemned her to remain looking down at the floor. Looking
        up, or to her side, was a strain that could only be endured for a few
        moments. 
       Alongside Kate there were other women in the same predicament. Nineteen
        others, Kate had counted. She had become part of an industry, a human
        factory farm. Whatever those twice-daily injection contained, they were
        achieving their purpose. The skin of her breasts was stretched taut,
        barely able to grow quickly enough to accommodate the growth within them. 
       The first expressing of the day always came as a welcome relief. The
        equipment used was heavy duty, and more closely resembled something from
        a cattle shed than the lightweight devices used on Rabbit Island. The
        two attendants, part of Brenda&#8217;s dungaree-clad team of dykes, went
        about their chores with a breezy cheerfulness, though engaging with Kate
        and their other breeders on only a perfunctory level, as one might a
        farm animal. With twenty pairs of breasts to attend to, plus the inseminations,
        spankings, the feeding and the exercise sessions, Brenda&#8217;s girls
        had busy schedule. 
       One of them bent down in front of Kate, briefly stroking her short
        cropped hair, and running her finger&#8217;s over the straps fitted around
        Kate&#8217;s head. &#8220;Silly cow! If you kept your mouth closed we
        wouldn&#8217;t have to keep you gagged like this,&#8221; she explained
        with mock sympathy. Kate made a discontented grunt of a reply from behind
        the ballgag prised between her teeth. Her outburst yesterday meant she
        would wear the gag all day today. Secured and gagged thus, Kate was hopeful
        that she could stay out of trouble today. 
       The bullet-shaped milking devices sucked up Kate&#8217;s nipples as
        soon as the dairy girl offered them up to her breasts. Kate trembled
        as she felt the familiar vibrations as her breasts were being drained.
        She hated it, yet was glad of the relief it gave her. She feared what
        would happen if they did not milk her twice a day, concerned that she
        might explode. 
       After the milking came the feeding. Kate&#8217;s gag was removed solely
        for that purpose. A porridge-like substance was spooned into her mouth.
        Kate barely had time to swallow before the next spoonful arrived, but
        she hungrily devoured all that was offered and would have eaten more
        had it been available. During her time in the breeding shed she had developed
        a voracious appetite.  
       Kate&#8217;s last mouthful was that infernal red rubber ball rammed
        back into her mouth. The dairy girl buckled her up once again. Kate tugged
        restlessly against her chains while the rest of the breeding herd was
        fed. She was already anticipating the intense sensations of the inseminator,
        which always followed the feeding. 
       
       THE INSEMINATOR 
       Rachel&#8217;s groans, of both pain and pleasure, filled Kate with
        an ambiguous anticipation of what she would soon be experiencing. Having
        a fellow Rabbit Islander alongside was a real comfort to Kate, even though
        she would not have wished such a predicament on anybody - least of all
        Rachel. While Rachel&#8217;s inseminator was working its devilish torment
        the dairy workers began rigging up Kate for her own daily dose. In this
        fashion the two inseminator machines were leapfrogged down the line of
        cowgirls, delivering ten or fifteen minutes of vibrating torment to each
        victim. 
       Billy, one of the dairy girls, hauled the heavy base of the inseminator
        into position between Kate&#8217;s thighs. The large dildo mounted on
        the vertical stand slipped easily between her labia, which had been shamefully
        moistened by the sound of Rachel&#8217;s continuing moans. 
       &#8220;Good girl!&#8221; the dungaree-clad dairy girl said condescendingly, &#8220;that&#8217;s
        what we like, wet and ready!&#8221;  
       Kate winced as the monstrous phallus was rammed into her sex as if
        she were just a farm animal. 
       The ten-minute cycle of vibrations, pulses and pumping was having the
        usual effect on Kate, except today was even more intense than usual.
        She could never figure out why the ballgag and the straps around her
        head would make it happen; yet it always heightened her sexual response.
        She bit down on the ball, her teary eyes closed as she braced herself
        for the inevitable shuddering conclusion. The gag, for all its severity,
        could do little to muffle her shame.  
       The inseminator didn&#8217;t so much give her an orgasm as wrench one
        from her.  
       Billy pulled out the inseminator and carried it to the next-but-one
        prisoner. This breeder had come into season and that entailed a little
        more preparation. Billy inserted a plastic vial of semen into the rear
        of the inseminator&#8217;s phallus. It was a high quality washed sperm,
        from a tall, brainy and handsome hunk from Holland - not that Billy cared
        for men in the slightest. 
       The inseminator rarely failed. This breeder would soon be carrying
        her fifth. 
       
       KAREN THE SCRUBBER 
       It had taken more than a week for Kate to figure out who was scrubbing
        the floor of the breeding shed every day. With only her eyes exposed
        beneath her lycra hood the figure was hard to recognise. Through the
        cutout oval in the front of the hood, her eyes looked vaguely familiar,
        but the dramatic black makeup served as a kind of camouflage. Why go
        to such lengths on just a cleaner, Kate wondered, perhaps to better accentuate
        the emotions felt by the cleaner, to better portray the hopelessness
        of her bondage? An observer was in no doubt that there was a real woman
        trapped without the cleaner&#8217;s lowly garb, and a pretty one too,
        to judge by her eyes. 
       Aside from the oval through which she viewed the world, the rest of
        Karen&#8217;s body was covered in black lycra and leather, right to her
        fingertips. Her legs were strapped into a kneeling position and then
        completely encased in a leather bag that gathered and locked around her
        waist. The &#8216;kneeling bag&#8217; provided her with a lap upon which
        she kept her cleaning solutions and rags. Her nipples had been pierced
        and ringed, and these protruded through holes in her lycra body covering.
        A short chain connected her nipples, providing her with something to
        hang her cleaning cloths from. The bottom of the kneeling bag was lined
        with a soft cloth so that as she shuffled around on the wooden floor
        she polished it as well. 
       Whenever Brenda&#8217;s girls were a safe distance away Karen and Kate
        would &#8216;talk&#8217;, at least when Kate wasn&#8217;t gagged. Karen&#8217;s
        mouth was always fully plugged beneath her lycra hood, so her end of
        the conversation consisted of shakes of the head for yes and no, and
        grunts of exclamation. Her eyes and hands were very expressive.  
       That was how Kate learned of Jessica&#8217;s fate, and how she had
        joined a team of four on a railway. It had taken several days of snatched
        moments for Karen to convey that information. As for Mandy&#8217;s whereabouts,
        Karen&#8217;s mime was much easier: She was scrubbing floors somewhere
        in the direction her hands pointed in. 
       A scrubber was not as prized as a breeder, so Karen didn&#8217;t receive
        the attention of the inseminator - of which she was quite jealous - but
        at least in her capacity as a cleaner she saw more of the island&#8217;s
        buildings than many of its residents. 
       Karen was done, leaving the floor scrubbed clean and the wood and metal
        fixings smelling of polish. Kate smiled when she saw Karen gliding past
        on her low wheeled trolley, being pulled along and onto be taken to her
        next cleaning assignment as if she were nothing more than a piece of
        cleaning equipment. 
       After Karen was wheeled for the cattle shed Kate&#8217;s daily routine
        resumed. 
       
       RICCARDO&#8217;S CHECKLIST 
       Riccardo&#8217;s mind often went back to the day, several weeks ago
        when he boarded the Silver Lady. He wasn&#8217;t forced to leave Rabbit
        Island in that way, he chose to. The reasons why he decided to go to
        Cavallo&#8217;s infamous island had been playing on his mind. He thought
        he had left behind feeling of obligation, commitment and a sense of duty
        long ago, in the days when he lived in what he referred to as the &#8216;old
        world&#8217;. When a man joins the society to which Rabbit Island belongs,
        he must cast aside traditional ideas of morality. Any attempt to rationalize
        the kidnap and systematic abuse of innocent women is futile. Not even
        Master Alex does it, although he had a tendency to shrug off such things
        with the comment that worse things happen in the world. People are brutalized,
        murdered or die horrible deaths in their millions every year. His interest
        in the welfare and happiness of Rabbit Island&#8217;s bunnies was not
        borne out of compassion but merely to prove a point. People do not have
        a divine right to happiness, or freedom, or prosperity, or anything else
        at all. He sometimes talked of Rabbit Island as a way of punishing the
        prosperous west for its arrogance... or at least some of their more attractive
        and submissive representatives. 
       It was hard to say who was doing it intentionally, but Riccardo and
        tall-necked Lucinda more often than not, would arrive at the cafe for
        the morning cappuccino at the same time. They were both creatures of
        habit, so much so that Isabel - the waitress who used to be a man - brought
        their refreshments without waiting for their orders. Riccardo was fascinated
        by the waitress, and would have liked to know more about how a man would
        feel about having every facet of his manhood removed. It was a uniquely
        cruel treatment. Lucinda liked to tease Isobel. Today she asked if she
        had a boyfriend yet. Isabel shook her head, blushing slightly. 
       Lucinda screwed up her pretty nose. &#8220;You&#8217;re not a lesbian,
        are you?&#8221; 
       Isabel nodded reluctantly. The operation and transformation had not
        changed the orientation of her mind, which was still that of a heterosexual
        male, one that was besotted with Lucinda, in spite of her teasing. 
       &#8220;You&#8217;re a woman now, you should be fucked only by men!&#8221; Lucinda
        reiterated with a wag of her finger. 
       Isabel&#8217;s chastened departure left Lucinda and Riccardo chuckling
        and smiling at each other. Considering how little they had in common,
        they got on surprisingly well, enjoying the other&#8217;s company even
        when they had nothing to say, often sitting in contented silence for
        several minutes. Conversation, when it arrived, usually involved Lucinda
        complimenting Riccardo on the great improvement shown by his ponygirl
        pair. It might have been flattery but it was also fact. They waited patiently
        nearby, proud, erect and motionless, seemingly eager to please their
        master. Lucinda discovered that Riccardo (and indeed all pony drivers!)
        liked talking about their ponygirls almost as much as they like handling
        them. 
       The Ponygirl Express was approaching in the distance. Riccardo and
        Lucinda turned to watch, as they usually did. They were bang on time,
        eight minutes before eleven o&#8217;clock. They kept better time than
        did his unreliable old watch. 
       Right before his eyes, he saw the four ponygirls falter just as they
        reached the upward slope, it looked like one of them had stumbled, upsetting
        the rhythm of the whole team. It was to prove a catastrophic mistake.
        Perhaps if the carriage hadn&#8217;t been fully laden with four men and
        sundry boxes they might have regained their momentum. 
       &#8220;They&#8217;re not going to make it,&#8221; Lucinda commented
        grimly. The ponygirl team ran out of momentum and came to a humiliating
        stop ten metres before the top of slope. They were stationary for a few
        wretched seconds before they began rolling back down the track. The ponygirls
        stumbled, desperate to keep their footing as the great weight of the
        carriage pulled them backwards at an ever-increasing speed. The men on
        board shouted out in exasperation, gesticulating wildly with their hands
        as if the ponygirls&#8217; failure had gravely insulted them. It came
        to a standstill at the tracks lowest point some two hundred metres away. 
       Riccardo hurriedly took his leave of Lucinda, mounted his pony trap,
        and set off along the dirt track that ran parallel to the railway. Just
        as his ponygirls were making a nice pace along the gentle downward slope,
        he tugged hard on their reins. They halted with a precision that came
        from Riccardo&#8217;s training. He noticed a sledgehammer laying on the
        track, just at the spot where he noticed that first stumble. It had to
        be the cause, he thought, moving it away from the track. 
       The passengers - factory and mine technicians - were in a foul mood,
        muttering melodramatically that they might have been killed as the carriage
        rolled backwards. One of them pressed repeatedly on the button that sent
        electric shocks into the anus of each ponygirl. Such was their pain that
        they could barely stand upright in their harnesses when Riccardo arrived. 
       &#8220;What are we supposed to do now?&#8221; One of the men asked
        Riccardo. With his being a pony driver they assumed he would know, and
        by association, held him partly to blame. 
       &#8220;You walk!&#8221; Riccardo said bluntly. &#8220;It&#8217;s no
        more than two hundred metres. The ponygirls won&#8217;t get back up the
        slope with your weight on board.&#8221; 
       The four men dismounted, muttering with discontent as they made their
        way on foot to the halting point.  
       Riccardo inspected the four panting ponygirls. Clad in black from head
        to toe they looked so alike that he had remind himself that one of them
        was Jessica. Her mouth was prised open by the bit, keeping her glossy
        red lips and perfect white teeth apart. It was a very kissable mouth
        even though she could hardly return a kiss when fixed like that. He didn&#8217;t
        need to study it for long; it was the same permanent fitment that his
        own ponygirls wore.  
       Jessica&#8217;s neck was so rigidly held and her body strapped so securely
        to the shafts she didn&#8217;t even attempt to turn to look at him. But
        she and her fellow ponygirls were angry, that much was obvious. The unwarranted
        shocks one of the passengers had delivered were still reverberating through
        them, leaving them squirming and struggling within the tight strapping
        of their leatherbodies. Even though pony drivers worked hard to train
        ponygirls out of such behaviour Riccardo still found a ponygirl wriggling
        within her straps to be a beguiling sight. Enough to remind him of the
        cursed cock restraint he wore. 
       Jessica and her team were eager to be running again, fearing the punishment
        that their lateness would bring, but Riccardo made them wait until he
        felt they had rested sufficiently. Then he beckoned them to start, and
        watched as they trotted past, and up to their stopping point without
        incident. He observed that Jessica was limping, and made a mental note
        to check on her later. 
       
      PADDLED AND BAGGED 
       &#8220;Mmmph!&#8221; complained Kate as the paddle hit her buttocks
        for the twentieth time. Billy was never happy until she had Kate in tears,
        with her rump red, stinging and sore. Still chained and fixed into her
        milking frame Kate could do nothing to avoid the repeating blows, even
        more than on normal days. Billy&#8217;s explanation that paddling was
        good for her blood&#8217;s circulation didn&#8217;t quite wash with her,
        though it was true she could feel herself flushing a bright red as her
        blood filled the capillaries near the skin. 
       Once she had been soundly paddled it was time for Kate&#8217;s afternoon
        hood. It was the same every afternoon for all the breeders: a couple
        of quiet hours with a black cotton bag loosely covering their heads.
        During that period of darkened solitude Kate would ponder her situation.
        If Rabbit Island didn&#8217;t come to collect her soon, she would become
        pregnant... and Rabbit Island had little use for a pregnant woman, so
        she might have to stay on La Plata, forever a breeder, or at least until
        she was no longer fertile. 
       Escape seemed impossible. She was perpetually chained and watched over
        by Billy and the other dykes in dungarees. It was only a matter of time
        that she would conceive via that monstrous inseminator once her cycle
        resumed. Then her fate would be sealed. Kate&#8217;s fingers traced down
        the crack of her buttocks as they often did. Coming into contact with
        her pussy lips, her fingertips could feel the scar, a protrusion of new
        skin where the stitches had been. Beneath it lay a small handcuff key
        which she had secreted and stitched within her flesh several months ago.
        It was literally itching to be used, like the proverbial &#8216;break
        glass in case of emergency&#8217; key. It was a once-only opportunity,
        and she wasn&#8217;t even sure the key would fit the cuffs she now wore.  
       Kate&#8217;s darkened fumbling was interrupted when someone slapped
        her hand.  
       &#8220;Don&#8217;t play with yourself!&#8221; the nurse scolded. 
       It must be Wednesday, Kate realised. This was the day when she gave
        blood. The nurse wrapped a rubber tourniquet around her bicep. A few
        moments later Kate felt the cool of the antiseptic swab and the prick
        of the needle. 
       The forced blood donation program was another of Madame Cavallo&#8217;s
        innovations. She insisted that her slaves&#8217; bodies were always productive;
        that they be utilised as livestock. The blood donation program ensured
        that a vital supply of blood was available in case of a medical emergency.
        With the occasional caesarean birth in the breeding program it was a
        prudent measure. 
        
        EXERCISE FOR BREEDERS 
       Kate awoke with a start as the hood was suddenly yanked off her head.
        She had be snoozing as she usually did in the afternoon, and more so
        than usual after giving blood. Daylight invaded through her eyelids. 
       The latches that held her to the frame were released with a rude iron
        clatter, then Billy&#8217;s hands in her armpits helped her to her feet.
        Soon all twenty breeders were roused, their eyes adjusting to the afternoon
        sunlight, standing ready, if not fully awake, to be led outside to their
        daily exercise session. 
       Kate tried in vain to straighten her white mini-dress as she walked.
        The hem never seemed long enough to fully cover her buttocks. There always
        seemed to be a slight breeze against her sex. The shed filled with the
        sound of jingling chains as the breeding females shuffled out into the
        humid late afternoon air. 
       Two snarling and yapping dogs were waiting for them outside, straining
        at their leashes. Their matching handlers tugged on the leashes to bring
        the dogs under control as the breeders scurried past. Kate and Rachel
        were at the rear, glancing nervously over their shoulders. 
       Like a bizarre gaggle of geese, the breeders moved along as fast as
        their hobble chains would allow. Behind them, the two border collies
        harried them, eager to bite at the bare heels of anyone that fell behind.
        They took the same route every day, a circuit of the large grassy area
        outside the breeding shed. Every day they passed the bitch-frame where
        Kate had been subjected to her bestial assault some weeks previous. She
        warily glanced backwards at the snarling dogs fearing that they had more
        in mind than a nip of her ankles. 
       Fifteen minutes of quick-step shuffling, having managed to avoid the
        snapping jaws of the sheep dogs for another day, the breeders were allows
        to kneel or sit down on the grass. 
       This was their best time of the day; they could talk freely whilst
        enjoying the air and the sunlight. Those who were pregnant had their
        hands cuffed in front of them, and once sitting on the ground had enough
        slack chain at their wrists to feel almost free. For those who weren&#8217;t
        carrying - just a few of them including Kate and Rachel - there was no
        such luxury. And for those that hadn&#8217;t learned to keep their mouth
        shut there was the harnessed ball-gag, every bit as humiliating as it
        was uncomfortable. Seeing Kate gagged yet again, the other breeders had
        her marked out as a fool, unable to learn her lesson. 
       Rachel kissed Kate on the cheek, giving her a sympathetic frown. &#8220;Promise
        me you&#8217;ll stay out of trouble and keep your mouth shut in future?
        How can I laugh at your stupid jokes if you&#8217;re gagged?&#8221; 
       Eight hours wearing her ballgag left Kate feeling sorry for herself,
        particularly when Rachel deserted her to make small talk with the other
        breeders. Kate&#8217;s attention wandered to the distant track where
        a pair of ponygirls was steadily approaching through the afternoon haze,
        although it was the driver that drew her attention. Kate&#8217;s strange
        whining noises, like a dog expectantly waiting for its owner, caught
        Rachel&#8217;s attention. 
       &#8220;Hey, it&#8217;s Riccardo!&#8221; Rachel said, breaking out into
        a broad grin, her shoulder bumping excitedly into Kate&#8217;s. Her ballgagged
        companion was busily using her mind powers to ensure that he stopped.
        It worked, or at least that was how Kate felt. 
       Riccardo jumped down from the trap looking the epitome of virile health.
        His hairy tanned legs bounded over to them, and Kate suddenly wondered
        if she wanted to see him after all. 
       &#8220;Hello Riccardo, Sir,&#8221; said Rachel. 
       &#8220;Mmmph!&#8221; said Kate. 
       &#8220;How&#8217;s life in the breeding shed?&#8221; Riccardo asked,
        while his eyes were transfixed by their bulgin&#8220;Have they made you
        pregnant yet?&#8221; 
       &#8220;Not yet.&#8221; Rachel nodded in the direction of the other
        breeders. &#8220;When you see our hands chained in front like they are,
        you know it&#8217;s too late.&#8221; 
       Riccardo looked towards the others and thought it a wonderful sight;
        there was even a distinctive and arousing aroma to them. With their protruding
        bellies they were the ultimate slaves, the facility of their womanhood
        utterly under the control of others. 
       While Kate leant against his leg, Rachel asked the Riccardo the question
        that had been preoccupying them:  
       &#8220;If we become pregnant, Riccardo Sir, will we still be allowed
        to go back to Rabbit Island?&#8221; 
       &#8220;They&#8217;ll probably make you have an abortion if you&#8217;re
        not too far along.&#8221; Riccardo guessed, &#8220;but most likely you&#8217;ll
        be required to stay here. I expect Cavallo will want to buy you.&#8221; 
       Rachel frowned. It was the outcome she and Kate most feared. While
        they talked Riccardo&#8217;s fingers were toying absently with Kate&#8217;s
        hair and head straps. Not that she minded... quite the contrary in fact. 
       Rachel glanced over at Riccardo&#8217;s pony trap. &#8220;Your ponygirls
        are looking good, Sir.&#8221; Rachel said. Such comments, complimenting
        a driver on his ponygirls were seldom out of place. Even slave girls
        could say it. 
       &#8220;It&#8217;s amazing what a little tender loving care, and a lot
        of discipline can accomplish. Madame Cavallo might soon take them into
        her private stable, and then I&#8217;ll get two more to train.&#8221; Riccardo
        explained. &#8220;Besides, training is more fun than just being used
        as a courier service. You see behind the two seats? That&#8217;s my cargo.
        I have to take her up to the processing plant.&#8221; 
       For the first time Kate and Rachel noticed the live cargo that Riccardo
        carried. 
       &#8220;It&#8217;s called a cigar. They tie her hands, and then place
        her in a lace-up leather bag. It&#8217;s laced behind her from ankles
        to neck, and is so tight she can hardly wiggle. It&#8217;s a La Plata
        speciality apparently. Sometimes they keep slaves in cigars for days
        at a time. 
       &#8220;Easy to handle.&#8221; Rachel observed with gentle sarcasm. 
       &#8220;Very easy. You can&#8217;t get into much trouble when you&#8217;re
        laced up in a cigar, although Kate would probably find a way!&#8221; 
       They both laughed at Kate&#8217;s expense, but she didn&#8217;t care
        just as long as Riccardo&#8217;s fingers continued to ruffle through
        her hair as she rubbed her face against his thigh. 
       &#8220;How&#8217;s Jessica doing?&#8221; Rachel asked hesitantly, chancing
        her luck while Riccardo was in a good mood. 
       &#8220;I think she hurt herself today. She tripped on something,&#8221; he
        replied. Caught off guard by the question, the truth came out before
        he could help himself. &#8220;I&#8217;ll try to see how she is later
        tonight.&#8221; 
       Riccardo returned to his ponygirls, inspecting them meticulously before
        mounting the trap and lightly whipping them into motion. It was one of
        those rare occasions when Kate wanted to be a ponygirl. 
       
      JESSICA HAS A VISITOR 
       Jessica had expected to be punished along with her three fellow ponygirls,
        and sure enough, when they finished their duties on the railway they
        were taken to the punishment column. The square stone column held a ponygirl
        on all sides, each of them with her hands shackled high above her head.
        They waited, almost ignored, for nearly an hour. They were assuming it
        was a ploy to increase their dread of the brutal caning that would surely
        be dealt to them. 
       The caning never arrived. Instead they were hosed with cold water and
        dried with coarse towels. Then they were moved to their respective stalls
        for yet another evening of tedious, solitary leather cleaning. 
       Jessica lavished attention on her leather garments, throughout the
        evening. To her it was a matter of pride that her leather garments were
        immaculate, particularly the pony boots which had travelled with her
        from Rabbit Island. She never let the chore get to her; in fact she thought
        it kept her sane. 
       Riccardo crept softly down the long row of stalls with a quiet nod
        of acknowledgement to his two ponygirls as he passed them without breaking
        stride. Each smiled for a brief moment hoping that he had come to see
        them, but tonight it was another pony that was occupying his thoughts. 
       &#8220;Do you mind if I sit down?&#8221; he asked Jessica in barely
        a whisper. She didn&#8217;t reply but her vague body language did enough
        to grant her assent. Riccardo sat down tentatively on the edge of her
        narrow bunk. He watched in fascination as she finished off her polishing,
        though perhaps she might have continued for longer had he not arrived.
        The wall opposite the bunk, barely an arm&#8217;s length away, held some
        of her tack, with the remainder including the leatherbody, placed neatly
        in a box that slipped under the bunk. The most visually striking items
        on the wall, and the most emotionally significant, were the two pony
        tails. The dark brown one was made from her own hair; the other, an exceptionally
        fine blonde tail, had been taken from Rachel. The latter was a reserve,
        just in case Jessica should join a blonde ponygirl team. 
       &#8220;How&#8217;s the foot?&#8221; Riccardo inquired. 
       Jessica looked down at her left foot - swollen and obviously black
        and blue, even in the dim light. &#8220;It hurts. They say it&#8217;s
        a twist and gave me a painkiller but I think it could be broken.&#8221; Her
        tone was measured and distant like her gaze, but humble, forever aware
        that Riccardo was on the other side - a Master to her slave. In her compact
        accommodation she had no choice but to sit on the bed alongside him.
        Her left hand held the chain that connected her sex to the opposite wall.
        The padlock passing through two piercings in her labia, hadn&#8217;t
        been removed since her arrival. The second padlock connecting the chain
        to her labial padlock was heavier, much heavier than it needed to be;
        designed not just to secure her but also to torment her. She noticed
        Riccardo looking at it, which was hardly surprising. The dull chink of
        the two padlocks and the chain constantly drew attention to her humiliating
        bondage. 
       &#8220;Is it true about the men here?&#8221; Jessica asked, with a
        wry a smile on her lips. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard rumours.&#8221; 
       &#8220;Is what true?&#8221; 
       Jessica pointed a tentative finger at Riccardo&#8217;s crotch. He didn&#8217;t
        answer but allowed her hand to come closer until her fingers pressed
        at his fly. She pushed harder on the fabric of his shorts and felt the
        rigid covering of his flaccid penis. 
       &#8220;It IS true!&#8221; She said with a kind of awe, forgetting herself
        for a moment and speaking much louder than their previously whispered
        conversation. It was a strange consolation to know that the men on the
        island didn&#8217;t have things all their own way. 
       &#8220;You&#8217;re quite safe with me tonight,&#8221; Riccardo joked
        with a hint of frustration. &#8220;Not that we&#8217;re allowed to fuck
        our ponies on Rabbit Island anyhow.&#8221; 
       Jessica had almost forgotten about that. She gave a sardonic laugh. &#8220;So
        I&#8217;m still your ponygirl then?&#8221;  
       Her mocking tone didn&#8217;t quite come off. Riccardo put an arm around
        her and pulled her close to him, in lieu of an answer. Tears welled in
        her eyes until there was nowhere for them to go but down her cheeks.
        He kissed her stubbly hair as she cried softly on his chest.

     Chapter 20. Checking out of the Breeding Program

      BRENDA&#146;S PIGS 
      &#147;Up you get!&#148; said Billy to Kate, not long after her morning
        milking. 
      The frame&#146;s clamps were unclipped, releasing Kate from its iron
        grip. Billy helped her to her feet. It wasn&#146;t the exercise period,
        which could only mean a trip to the surgery for a medical. She knew they
        were becoming increasingly frustrated that Kate&#146;s periods showed
        no sign of restarting. 
      Brenda and Billy frog-marched Kate from the breeding shed. 
      &#147;Where are we going?&#148; Kate asked, skipping along awkwardly
        in her ankle restraints in order to keep up with her escorts. They&#146;d
        walked straight past the surgery. 
      &#147;You&#146;re going to assist with our breeding program,&#148; Brenda
        explained. &#147;Just because you can&#146;t get pregnant doesn&#146;t
        mean you can&#146;t help in other ways.&#148; 
      Other ways? Kate was alarmed. She was already giving milk and blood.
        What other fluids could she give? 
      They entered a building that Kate hadn&#146;t been in before. (Breeders
        didn&#146;t get to travel much.) The utilitarian brickwork and lack of
        any decorative features betrayed its purpose. This was a place for prisoners. 
      Kate&#146;s mouth gaped open in shock and fear. &#147;Oh... my... god!&#148; 
      Brenda laughed, and flourished her open palm around the room as if to
        show it off. &#147;This is where we collect our precious semen, and today
        you&#146;re going to help us.&#148; 
      In each of the four corners of the small windowless room was a man kneeling
        on a frame not unlike her own so-called breeding frame. Their wrists
        were secured in heavy leather cuffs fitted to the front legs of the frame.
        It wasn&#146;t their naked bodies that shocked Kate, it was the tight
        leather hoods they wore. Small holes were provided for the eyes and nostrils
        whilst the mouth was closed with a heavy steel zip. 
      Billy unlocked the chains from Kate's wrists - something which wasn&#146;t
        even done during her medicals. Kate lifted her aching arms so the dress
        could be removed. One man made a deep guttural growl at the sight of
        her revealed nakedness. Her hands weren&#146;t free for long. Billy lashed
        them together behind her with a soft white rope and pushed her to the
        floor. Then her ankle shackles were removed to be replaced by more white
        rope around her crossed ankles. 
      &#147;Not too tight,&#148; Brenda instructed Billy, &#147;if the ankles
        and wrists are too close she can&#146;t wriggle as much. The pigs like
        to watch the bitch rolling around while she&#146;s beaten!&#148; 
      Thus was Kate fixed into a medium hog-tie. She lay on the ample cushioning
        of her breasts, her fingers idly bending and straining in search of loose
        knots while Billy&#146;s and Brenda&#146;s Doc Martens busily passed
        back and forth in front of her nose as they made their preparations. 
      &#147;Hold this!&#148; Brenda commanded, pushing the shaft of a riding
        crop to Kate&#146;s lips. Kate took it gingerly between her teeth at
        its middle point. &#147;And don&#146;t you DARE drop it while I&#146;m
        getting the pigs sorted out.&#148; 
      Brenda flicked a switch on the wall and Kate&#146;s viewpoint began
        to change. She was on a slowly revolving segment of the floor, turning
        at about the speed of a second hand on a clock; slow enough for each
        man to get a complete look at her. In turn Kate observed at the so-called
        pigs, but there seemed little to distinguish any of the four unfortunates. 
      While Kate and her immobile body counted the minutes Brenda busied herself
        behind each man, fitting his penis with a condom-like receptacle and
        pushing it through a padded circular hole that would provide the necessary
        friction, in lieu of a vagina or a hand. 
      &#147;Hey, you little slut. You&#146;re welcome to come again. They
        like you!&#148; Brenda cheerfully called out from behind the last of
        the four men. &#147;The pigs all had nice hard cocks so I didn&#146;t
        have to massage anyone today.&#148; 
      Holding the riding crop firmly between her teeth Kate grunted to acknowledge
        the comment, just in case Brenda felt the urge to repeat herself. 
      This was exactly the kind of thing Brenda quit her career in her mid-thirties
        to do. Dominate and brutalise other women in the way that she enjoyed.
        Her notorious sadism eventually had her frozen out of the lesbian club
        scene throughout the length of the East coast. Here on La Plata though
        her penchant for erotic brutalisation had found its true home. She despised
        attractive young blondes like Kate, that&#146;s why they were her favourite
        subjects for punishment. They deserved it. 
      Brenda took hold of the riding crop. &#147;Kiss it!&#148; she commanded.  
      &#147;That&#146;s right. You love to be beaten with a crop don&#146;t
        you? A little bird told me you can orgasm just from a flogging alone.
        You&#146;re a sick woman Kate, and these pigs are sick too. You deserve
        each other.&#148; 
      Kate lowered her forehead to the floor and braced herself for the onslaught.
        At first the blows were measured, as if Brenda was finding her distance
        to Kate&#146;s body and gauging her victim&#146;s reactions. Gradually
        the swats increased in frequency, working on each part of Kate&#146;s
        flesh until the skin was one large red blotch. 
      Hundreds of swats later Brenda had demonstrated her expertise with the
        crop. If a hog-tied body could dance, then Kate was doing the twist.
        No matter how she turned and squirmed Brenda always had some tender flesh
        to aim for. Her Doc Marten boot dug into Kate&#146;s ribs, indicating
        she should roll over to expose her belly, then a whole new area of pale
        flesh was revealed to be in need of colouring. 
      Brenda chuckled. &#147;That&#146;s right girl, let&#146;s get those
        juicy nipples of yours nice and red.&#148; The leather flap of the crop
        beat double time all over Kate&#146;s breasts. All Kate could do was
        pant and grimace and make the occasional &#145;owww!&#146; when it became
        too much. 
      All the while during Kate&#146;s assault the four wooden frames creaked
        in rhythm until, one by one, the noise ceased as each man gave a desperate
        grunt and made his deposit. When all four frames has stopped creaking
        the riding crop was tossed to the floor beside her, its purpose apparently
        fulfilled. Kate lay exhausted, her skin burning tingling all over. 
      Brenda&#146;s attention returned to her pigs, carefully collecting,
        storing and labelling their donations. She seemed very satisfied as she
        left the room taking the precious white liquid to the surgery. 
      Kate was alone with the four men feeling unaccountably nervous in spite
        of their heavy binding. While the turntable continued its slow revolution
        Kate rested and recovered, her simple rope hogtie bothering her much
        less than the stares of desperate men. They seemed like monsters, secured
        for her protection and their own. If they could break free of their restraints
        she feared they might rip her apart in a violent sexual frenzy. Those
        stares were even worse than she encountered while working in the Middle
        East. 
      Twenty minutes later, Brenda and Billy returned. Kate never thought
        a time would come when she&#146;d be glad to see them. She was hoping
        to feel the familiarity of her breeder chains, but they had other plans
        for her. 
      There was no mistaking the jumble of straps in Billy&#146;s hand. Kate
        knew from its phallic protrusions that it was destined for her. 
      &#147;Now it&#146;s time for your treat,&#148; Brenda announced with
        her &#145;cruel mother&#146; tone of voice. &#147;Billy will fit you
        up with our three-way belt while I get the pigs prepared for their encore.&#148; 
      Kate lay on her side in a surly pouting silence, opening her knees so
        Billy could pass the belt around her waist and between her legs. There
        was a small dildo for each orifice. Kate winced as the sleek intruders
        were pushed into her, deciding not to complain about the lack of lubrication.
        The third item of the three way belt was positioned snugly over her clitoris.
        Billy took much more care over this one. Once in position it seemed to
        suck onto her clit, as if taking charge of it. Billy buckled up the neat
        leather straps of the belt.  
      The hungry stares of the four men seemed to drill into Kate, their lust
        unabated. She could see the whites of their eyes flickering, taking in
        the full splendour of her naked body. Her oversized breasts were calling
        out to them, as if they yearned to feel a man&#146;s strong fingers gripping
        them like an eagle&#146;s talons. Kate was no longer a person, but simply
        an erotic bundle of soft squirming flesh - an effective prop to aid in
        the production of semen. 
      Brenda slapped her hands together, as if removing dust, indicating her
        pigs were ready for their second round. Billy flicked the switch that
        signalled the beginning of Kate&#146;s further torment. Never had she
        wanted an orgasm less, yet she knew the intimate contact of the three
        way belt would make it inevitable. 
      This time, while Kate&#146;s turntable slowly revolved, Brenda and Billy
        stood at the edge of the room laughing and joking, enjoying the humiliation
        of the male and female victims under their control - all of them well
        on their way to orgasm. 
      Brenda was right. The men certainly were aroused by the sight of a naked
        and helpless woman racked with pain and sexual torment. And Kate for
        her part, knew that the tightness of the rope around her wrists and ankles,
        and that futile tug of her limbs would have the same effect as it had
        since her self-bondage efforts in her early teens. 
      The buzz between her legs grew gradually stronger. It made a nice change
        from the brutal industrial thump of the inseminator in the breeding shed,
        but the insistent buzzing of the three way belt was just a potent and
        was beginning to driver her crazy. The intolerable itch could only be
        relieved one way, and that was by yielding to it. She closed her eyes
        and hummed along with the vibrations that engulfed her from breasts to
        belly to thighs. 
      Kate tried to keep quiet, but it wasn&#146;t easy for one unfailingly
        vocal during her lovemaking. Regular lovers and Masters on Rabbit Island
        would take the precaution of gagging her. She often appreciated the modesty
        a gag provided. 
      Her four man audience, with Brenda and Billy exchanging saliva in the
        background, enjoyed the full range of Kate&#146;s stream-of-consciousness
        expletive-laden commentary that led after several minutes of blue air
        to her back-aching, limb-straining orgasm. 
      Brenda and Billy continued their lewd embrace unabated - blue dungarees,
        ample flesh and white tee shirts entwined - while Kate sobbed with relief
        and the conscripted semen donors slumped exhausted and sated onto their
        frames. Kate felt as embarrassed for the men as she was for herself.
        It gave her no pleasure, certainly not sexual, to see men treated that
        way. 
      When they eventually unravelled themselves, Brenda attended to her pigs,
        while Billy, her apprentice, followed in close attendance. She was there
        to learn.  
      Kate was ignored now her job was done. There&#146;s only so much fun
        a woman can have in a hogtie, particularly after the pleasure of sinew
        stretching orgasms has receded. They could at least have switched off
        her turntable, Kate grumbled to herself. She was getting dizzy. 
      &#147;You were a nurse, weren&#146;t you Katie?&#148; Brenda called
        out as she continued to stow away the precious sperm. 
      Kate bit her tongue at being addressed so familiarly by someone she
        despised. &#147;I still am!&#148; She replied indignantly. 
      Brenda held up an elegantly curved steel implement.&#147;Ever seen one
        of these before?&#148; 
      Kate strained to see as her turntable spun her away from the object
        Brenda held. She shook her head. No, she didn&#146;t recognise it, but
        she sensed where the implement might be heading. 
      Brenda and Billy were positioned behind one of the men, with Billy following
        Brenda&#146;s every instruction as a diligent student. &#147;That&#146;s
        right Billy, stick it all the way into him... now rock it slowly back
        and forth.&#148; 
      A strange peace descended on the room before Brenda finally piped up. &#147;We&#146;re
        milking his prostate. That&#146;s what we do if a pig doesn&#146;t come
        a second time. Extracting the last of his fluid means that next time
        he donates, everything is fresh. Once he is drained he won&#146;t be
        thinking much about sex for a few days!&#148;  
      A world where men didn&#146;t think about sex was Brenda&#146;s idea
        of heaven, even though they were unlikely to ever be thinking about sex
        with her. 
      Billy released Kate from the three-way belt and the hogtie. She was
        soon dressed again, in her flimsy dress that created more breezes than
        it stopped, and the heavy leather retaining belt resting on her hips.
        Only when the transport chains were snicked onto her wrists and ankles
        did Kate feel properly attired. It meant she&#146;d soon be back in the
        secure surroundings of the breeding shed. 
       
      CAVALLO AND THE DOCTOR 
      &#147;So it&#146;s all arranged then?&#148; Cavallo asked the doctor,
        having strolled unannounced into his consulting room. 
      &#147;Everything is in hand Madame, just as you requested. The surgeon
        and the anaesthetist will arrive here in four days.&#148; The doctor
        was becoming exasperated at having to repeat himself to his excited employer. &#147;We&#146;re
        all ready. The ponygirl has been moved to the isolation area.&#148; 
      Cavallo looked heavenward with a broad, smug grin. &#147;It&#146;s so
        fitting don&#146;t you think, that one of Rabbit Island&#146;s ponygirls
        should replace the one I lost on their island. With her ankle in plaster
        for six weeks it&#146;s such an ideal time to perform the operation.
        Almost like it was meant to be.&#148; 
      The doctor could not argue with Cavallo&#146;s fiendish logic. It was
        inevitable that another armless ponygirl would have to be found or created
        to join up with the exising three. He hoped that last year, when Cavallo
        secured her long-held ambition to run a pair of &#145;true ponies&#146; that
        that would be the end of it. Instead it was merely the beginning.  
      It still rankled with the doctor about one of the previous amputees
        who didn&#146;t make the grade. She never would. It was a senseless and
        cruel waste to carry out the amputations on one that had never proved
        herself as a ponygirl.  
      He disapproved of Cavallo&#146;s Machiavellian plan to further experiment
        on the girl with that memory erasing procedure, but perhaps in a strange
        way it was a mercy. The girl&#146;s memory loss proved far more effective
        than they could have hoped for. So much so that Cavallo decided in a
        moment of sheer folly and vanity that the girl should be released from
        her duties on La Plata; released into the outside world.  
      That was how Janie came to be found wandering dazed and weak on a beach
        in Koh Samui. Janie&#146;s release had triggered a series of events that
        led to Rabbit Island leaving some of the best slaves in her care. That
        made Cavallo more confident than ever, emboldened by the success of her
        plans. 
      &#147;Have you done the fertility tests on that pony driver yet?&#148; Cavallo
        demanded of the nurse as she entered the room. 
      &#147;A high sperm count and disease free,&#148; the nurse reported
        after consulting her clipboard. 
      &#147;Excellent!&#148; Cavallo proclaimed, her nostrils flared as she
        breathed in the scent of triumph. &#147;Just as I hoped. That interfering
        Spaniard can stay in the donor shed for a week or two. I believe we have
        to fill a breeding order for some latin blood and I must admit he is
        healthy and good-looking. Perhaps now he can contribute something instead
        of always complaining about the way we treat ponygirls.&#148; 
      Cavallo was seething under the surface as she thought back to the incident
        a couple of days ago when Riccardo insulted her. Perhaps it was a bit
        insensitive - foolhardy in retrospect - to make the connection between
        her name and the length of her nose. 
       
      BREEDING TIME 
      Four days had passed since her trip to the sperm donors&#146; room and
        Kate was increasingly concerned by the absence of Riccardo and Jessica.
        Riccardo and his pony pair, invariably seen during the afternoon exercise
        session, had vanished. Not even replaced by anybody else. Another ponygirl
        had replaced Jessica, so the rumour mill in the breeding shed had it.
        It was a reasonable assumption. 
      Kate was in her usual position at that time of the morning, fixed to
        her frame, the breast pumps relieving her of the ever-increasing yield.
        It was a time for meditation, a moment to be absorbed in her self. But
        this morning, at that most unwelcome time, she had a visitor. It was
        the feet that Kate noticed first. Not that there was anything unusual
        in that - her face-downwards position in the frame ensured it. 
      They were a young woman&#146;s feet, clad in worn leather roman sandals,
        the toenails painted a deep red, with several metal bangles around each
        ankle. Quite pretty feet, Kate thought. While she was musing on how and
        if those close fitting bangles could be ever removed from the ankles
        a hand gripped her hair and lifted her head upwards. 
      &#147;Are you Kate?&#148; 
      Kate&#146;s neck was straining backwards against the retaining hoop,
        making it difficult to catch her breath. &#147;Yes,&#148; she gasped. &#147;You&#146;re
        choking me.&#148; 
      Lucinda didn&#146;t apologise. She retained her grip so they could still
        face each other.  
      Kate knew about Lucinda - a slave since birth, a child in a woman&#146;s
        body. She was tortured and abused at the Bacchanal along with Kate and
        the others, but at other times she seemed to roam unhindered - free range
        to Kate&#146;s battery hen. Even now, in the breeding shed, Billy watched
        warily from a distance, almost fearful of approaching Lucinda, such was
        the ambiguity of her status. 
      &#147;Riccardo&#146;s in prison. He asked me to see you. He needs your
        help.&#148; Lucinda whispered. 
      That was too much for Kate. Fixed to a frame while her breasts were
        being mechanically drained with a giraffe-necked girl asking for her
        help. &#147;Let me just finish what I&#146;m doing and I&#146;ll come
        right over and sort it out.&#148; 
      Lucinda looked confused. &#147;You will?&#148; 
      &#147;No. I won&#146;t. I was being sarcastic. I&#146;m a prisoner myself,
        in case you hadn&#146;t noticed.&#148; Kate jingled her chains for effect. &#147;Why&#146;s
        he in prison? He&#146;s a pony driver. A Master.&#148; 
      Lucinda sighed. &#147;Something about a ponygirl. He had an argument
        with Madame. She wanted to amputate to make another true ponygirl, and
        he said something about being better to amputate her nose. I thought
        that was actually quite rude. Anyhow, I think ponygirls look better without
        arms. Much sleeker, and more obedient too.&#148; 
      &#147;Actually I don&#146;t!&#148; Kate said tersely. It was all she
        could do to keep calm when dealing with this strangely immature woman,
        still maintaining a tight grip of her hair. She had to ask the question: &#147;Which
        ponygirl?&#148; 
      &#147;The one with the broken ankle. I don&#146;t recall her name. Just
        a ponygirl!&#148; Lucinda said in an offhand manner as if asked what
        she had for breakfast. In her limited world, Lucinda knew little about
        friendship until Riccardo arrived and couldn&#146;t conceive that anyone
        might have a friendship with a ponygirl. To her they were animals that
        looked like women, an everyday means of transport. 
      Kate&#146;s eyes moistened. &#147;When?&#148; 
      &#147;Later today. I think Riccardo will be released soon after the
        ponygirl&#146;s operation. I don&#146;t know why he&#146;s making such
        a fuss. Anyway, I&#146;ve told you, just as he asked me. So I&#146;m
        going now. Bye.&#148; 
      With that, Lucinda finally released her grip on Kate&#146;s hair, allowing
        Kate&#146;s head to drop physically as it had metaphorically. Lucinda
        strolled carefree along the aisle of the breeding shed, chatting with
        a few of the more familiar breeders as she went. 
      Kate was deep in thought, while Rachel alongside her could only muster
        a quiet &#147;Oh my God!&#148; 
      The milking was almost complete as Billy arrived to give Kate&#146;s
        breasts a firm and finally squeeze. &#147;Well done girl. Good yield!&#148; Billy
        said cheerily. It was important to give the breeders encouragement and
        to make them feel appreciated, but Kate barely heard the remarks. 
      Breakfast followed milking. It was demeaning to be so crudely fed when
        fixed to a breeding frame but Kate usually wolfed down the porridge-like
        mush that arrived in large spoonfuls. Normally she would still have her
        mouth gaping open for more as the feeding pot went down the line. Today
        her mouth stayed closed after the second mouthful, too nervous to eat. 
       
      KATE&#146;S INSEMINATION 
      There seemed to be an awful lot happening with the inseminator. Brenda
        and Billy were fussing around behind her for several minutes, preparing
        something. Usually they just rammed it into her (wet or dry it didn&#146;t
        matter) and switched on that monstrous motor. 
      Brenda slapped Kate&#146;s buttocks. &#147;There we are. All loaded
        and ready to fire.&#148; 
      Kate felt the same familiar heavily ribbed phallus pushing into her
        sex, but today was different. She knew enough about her body to be aware
        that this was the day they had been waiting for - and the day she dreaded
        - when she would become an official breeder. It was turning into a very
        bad day. 
      The inseminator was pumping and vibrating with its unrelenting, yet
        undeniably stimulating rhythm that no man could match. Despite Kate&#146;s
        best mental efforts to resist, the effect was the same as ever. Her pulse
        raced, her skin became clammy, a bead of perspiration trickled down to
        the tip of her nose and splashed onto the floor. &#147;No!&#148; she
        cried out repeatedly, as if mental power alone could save her. 
      When the inseminator made its last long thrusts following shortly after
        Kate&#146;s orgasm, her desperate cry of &#147;No&#148; became a lament...
        for herself, and for Jessica too. 
       
      KAREN GETS BUSY 
      &#147;You see those little specks? Make sure you scrape them all off,
        otherwise the varnish won&#146;t be smooth.&#148;  
      Karen looked up at her minder to acknowledge that she understood. Their
        eyes lingered on each other for a moment. The man smiled. She had nice
        eyes, he&#146;d told her recently. It was true, she had big passionate
        eyes that responded brilliantly to the daily makeup session before she
        started cleaning duties. This man, her supervisor, despite his beatings
        and bullying, had something resembling affection for her. Karen was sure
        of it. She was in her regular cleaning position, kneeling on her shins,
        her legs strapped together and encased in a leather bag with a soft underside
        that enabled her to slide along the floor as she cleaned. 
      The supervisor left Karen to her task, scraping the breeding shed&#146;s
        wooden floor of all lumps and accumulated stuck-on detritus, prior to
        its revarnishing. It was going to be a long and boring day... or so she
        thought.  
      &#147;Pssst!&#148; 
      Karen heard the sound but continued to rub the small wire brush into
        the angle where the floor met the wall. 
      &#147;Psst! Karen.&#148; 
      With barely a twitch of a latex covered finger Karen subtly acknowledged
        Kate&#146;s call, then she resumed her scrubbing. After a minute had
        elapsed she shuffled over to Kate&#146;s side of the walkway and carried
        on with her menial task. Billy and the other breeding shed workers kept
        a suspicious eye on her from the other end of the shed. 
      &#147;Karen. Listen to me,&#148; Kate muttered with a sotto voce urgency. &#147;Later
        this afternoon they&#146;re going to operate on Jessica. They&#146;re
        going to...&#148; 
      Karen nodded to save Kate from completing her dreadful statement. She
        had already heard the news. 
      &#147;Do you remember when you first arrived on Rabbit Island? We took
        the keys from the pony driver, and I unlocked myself and took him back
        to the lodge?&#148; 
      Karen nodded impatiently. Of course she remembered, but what did that
        have to do with Jessica&#146;s predicament? 
      &#147;I still have one of the keys! I&#146;m going to use it this afternoon.
        I want you to help if you can.&#148; 
      Kate&#146;s urgent tone caused her to speak louder than she ought. Billy
        came stomping down the aisle. She kicked Karen to one side, then slapped
        Kate sharply on the side of her head. &#147;I told you to keep quiet!
        If you can&#146;t keep quiet you wear the gag!&#148; Kate&#146;s gag
        harness hung on a hook at the front of her frame, ready for instant fittings. 
      The red rubber ball pushed against Kate&#146;s clenched teeth for a
        moment. She been conditioned to open and grasp the ball fully the moment
        it was offered. Any resistance would only bring punishment. Billy quickly
        buckled up the straps, behind and over Kate&#146;s head, and then a third
        one under her chin. With each strap Billy pulled hard until she found
        a extra hole, causing the straps to bite into Kate&#146;s face, and pulling
        the ball so deep into her mouth that she almost choked. 
      Billy stormed away, greatly annoyed by the interruption. It seemed affected,
        showing off to Brenda that she was capable of keeping order in the breeding
        shed. 
      &#147;She stitched the key into her flesh,&#148; Rachel said, taking
        up where Kate had left off, but before she could say anything else, Billy
        was jogging down the aisle again, a ballgag in hand. 
      &#147;So? You want to be gagged like your friend do you?&#148; Billy
        mocked. &#147;Perhaps you&#146;ll give me some peace now!&#148; 
      The gags came just in time for the afternoon nap. Dark cotton sacks
        were placed over the heads of Rachel, Kate and all the other breeders.
        Gradually the shed quietened as activities and conversation ceased. This
        was the time of day when Brenda and Billy took an extended lunch break. 
       Soon the only sound to be heard was Karen scraping away at the stains
        on the floor. Cleaners didn&#146;t get lunch. It was too much trouble
        to remove their head coverings and gags. And because Karen and other
        cleaners sat or knelt down all day they weren&#146;t deemed to need a
        rest either. 
      While Karen scraped and chipped at the floor, Kate&#146;s fingers arched
        into the crack of her buttocks, tugging to the full extent her chains
        allowed. She felt the scarred lump just behind her labia with her fingertip
        and tried to dig her finger into it. Without the edge of a fingernail
        the skin could not be broken. The key that she had so skilfully secreted
        and kept a secret for so long had buried itself too deep. She would have
        willingly ripped open her soft flesh, but it absorbed and deflected the
        blunt attack of her finger. Sobs of self-pity and despair welled up inside
        her, until tears streamed down her face. The darkness of the hood hiding
        her shame. 
      Kate was startled by a hand gripping her thigh. She hadn&#146;t noticed
        anyone creep up behind her. Expecting to hear the taunts of Billy, she
        instead felt a sharp pain as something coarse and metallic cut into the
        flesh at the very place her fingertip had been. The flesh was being cut
        with a rapid sawing action. Kate could feel warm blood trickling down
        her thigh, until a rag wiped against it. 
      Metal struck metal amidst the flesh and blood. Karen&#146;s latex covered
        fingers squeezed Kate's flesh as if to remove a large splinter. The round
        head of the key emerged slowly from Kate&#146;s bloody flesh until Karen
        was able to grasp it. Kate attempted to offer up her chained wrists to
        the key just in case Karen didn&#146;t know what to do with it. Karen&#146;s
        hands gripped Kate&#146;s as she struggled to push the key into the hole.
        It seemed to take an eternity. It was difficult for Karen to grip the
        key with latex-covered, blood-smeared gloves. 
      Pushing the key into the lock was difficult, but opening it was impossible.
        The key didn&#146;t fit. Karen slapped angrily at Kate&#146;s thigh in
        frustration. All she could do was try to stem the bleeding and clear
        up the spills in the vain hope that nobody would notice. 
      Karen shuffled around to the front aisle again, having given up on stemming
        the blood that flowed freely in a neat red line down to Kate&#146;s knee.
        She pulled off Kate&#146;s hood in order to apologise face-to-face. It
        might be her last chance she feared, sensing where this failed stunt
        would leave them. She stroked Kate&#146;s tear-stained leather-strapped
        face with her hand. They had done their best. It obviously wasn&#146;t
        meant to be.  
      Heavy footsteps were approaching on the other side of the door: Brenda
        or Billy&#146;s Doc Martens! They all knew the sound well enough. Instead
        of replacing Kate&#146;s hood Karen scooted along the floor for several
        yards, as if to detach herself from Kate&#146;s predicament. 
      &#147;What the... how the...&#148; Billy gasped upon noticing Kate&#146;s
        hood lying on the floor. Kate shrugged her shoulders and tried to look
        innocent, although the ballgag straps cutting into her head rendered
        any expression meaningless, or simply comical. Billy bent down to pick
        up the hood. She&#146;d get to the bottom of what happened when Kate
        was ungagged later in the day. 
      Karen was too quick, gathering Billy&#146;s legs together at the knees
        and toppling her over. The element of surprise had worked in her favour
        and she had the initiative. A prizefighter&#146;s blow with her fist
        hit Billy in the mouth, drawing blood and cutting the latex on her knuckles.
        She grasped Billy&#146;s head in her hands. After three sickening thuds
        from the back of Billy&#146;s head against floor the one-sided fight
        was over. The shed went very quiet. 
      Billy&#146;s toolbelt held the object of their desire, a set of keys
        which Karen jingled triumphantly a few inches in front of Kate&#146;s
        nose. She undid Kate&#146;s gag straps before shuffling hurriedly around
        the back to unlock her chains. 
      &#147;You&#146;re scary. Do you know that?&#148; said Kate as she stood
        up, rubbing the handcuff grooves in her wrists. She pulled her flimsy
        white dress over her head and stood naked, and for the first time in
        recent memory, totally unencumbered by clothing, shackles or the domineering
        stares of those who enslaved her. 
      They undressed Billy&#146;s unconscious body, Karen diligently mopping
        up the spills from the mouth and head wounds while Kate peeled off the
        dungarees.  
      When one of the other breeders asked what was happening, Kate&#146;s
        threat to kill her brought the enquiry to a swift end. The docility of
        her breeding companions continued to appal her. 
      So far so good, thought Kate as she adjusted the bib of the loose fitting.
        It was good, but scary. 
      More footsteps approached, softer ones than before. Now there were two
        of them to tackle the next person to walk into the room, though Kate
        sensed Karen was ready to perform the same trick as before. 
      The nurse entered. It was blood donation day, as Kate would have remembered
        had she not been so distracted by the other events of the day. Kate&#146;s
        and the nurses eyes met, both with reason to be nervous. 
      &#147;Wait a minute! You&#146;re not...&#148; said the nurse, her voice
        fading away as she slumped lifeless to the ground. Billy&#146;s tazer
        rod was a highly effective tool Karen discovered. A mere touch to the
        nurse&#146;s thigh was all that was needed. Kate foll owed up with a
        sedative jab into the nurse&#146;s buttock. This assault was bloodless,
        if no less ruthless. 
      Kate hurriedly stripped herself of the dungarees, positively hopping
        with adrenalin. She began undressing the unconscious nurse, the white
        outfit would be much more suitable than the dungarees. She pulled off
        Rachel&#146;s hood. &#147;Sorry Rachel, we need your place.&#148; Karen
        shuffled behind Rachel and unlocked her shackles. 
      If it wasn&#146;t so serious they might have smiled. Kate had assumed
        her rightful role as a nurse, at least in appearance. She was immediately
        comfortable in the nurse&#146;s tight dress, even though she had begun
        to like Rabbit Island&#146;s absurdly revealing apron. Kate figured that
        Rachel, hailing from Texas, would feel equally at home in a tee shirt
        and dungarees! 
      It took the combined efforts of the three of them to get the slumped
        bodies of Billy and the nurse secured into their breeding frames. Once
        they were dressed, chained, gagged and hooded they looked just like the
        other breeders. Except these two were the only ones that weren&#146;t
        trembling. 
      There was a medicine cabinet on the wall which Kate knew very well.
        In particular she knew of its sedating hypodermics, which were ready
        to incapacitate an unruly inmate within seconds. Kate plunged a needle
        into Billy&#146;s ample and the nurse&#146;s rather shapely naked rumps.
        From her own bitter experience she was confident that they would remain
        subdued for at least two hours. 
      Rachel was trying every key in her attempt to release Karen from her
        kneeling bondage. It seemed so cruel that Karen should remain in her
        bondage after her heroic effort. Only the cleaning department held her
        keys. 
      &#147;Where&#146;s the surgery?&#148; Kate asked Karen.  
      Karen pointed to the door at the far end of the shed, then she pointed
        at herself. She knew the way, she attempted to say in her heavily gagged
        tones. The dramatic flaring of her eyes said that she was coming with
        them, pointing at the nearby trolley, her means of transport from one
        building to another. If they could pull her along she would take them
        there. With a practiced little jump she mounted the three-inch step onto
        her trolley, then pointed at Rachel. As the dyke impersonator it was
        Rachel&#146;s job to pull the trolley to the cleaner&#146;s next assignment.
        Kate had only to behave like a nurse. What could be easier? 
      They walked towards the door with Rachel pulling Karen&#146;s squeaking
        trailer behind her. Kate placed her hand on the door handle and looked
        to her companions. Rachel was trembling, she was very bad casting as
        a butch dyke in dungarees. Karen was calmer, but still locked and latexed
        in her kneeling position, obliged to travel on her low-loading trailer.
        It wasn&#146;t exactly the A team. 
      &#147;Ready?&#148; Kate asked. 
      Rachel and Karen barely nodded. 
      Kate gritted her teeth, whispered up a prayer, and slowly pushed open
        the door. &#147;Then let&#146;s go.&#148;

      Chapter 21. The Operation 
        (Even Ponygirls Sometimes Get the Blues, by Aurelius)

      THE OPERATING TABLE 
      &#147;You and I look quite alike, you know,&#148; said Madame Cavallo
        as she teased one of Jessica&#146;s ringed nipples with her finger. 
      Jessica&#146;s hands clenched as she tugged against the leather wrist
        cuffs that fixed them to the operating table. With her ankles similarly
        fixed, twelve inches apart, she was as helpless to resist Cavallo&#146;s
        advances as she was to close her ears to the verbal torment. 
      &#147;Oh yes, quite similar... except I&#146;m perhaps a couple of years
        older and you are slightly prettier, I must admit. How old are you now
        Jessica?&#148; 
      &#147;Twenty-four,&#148; Jessica said, before realizing she hadn&#146;t
        taken her year on Rabbit Island into account. She wasn&#146;t aware of
        exactly when her birthday had occurred. &#147;No. Twenty-five.&#148; 
      &#147;Did you know I went to medical school?&#148; 
      Jessica shook her head, eying Cavallo warily. Cavallo was standing over
        her in a white surgeon&#146;s smock, which suited her rather too well. 
      &#147;In Boston actually. I loved it there. It&#146;s such a beautiful
        city. I made good friends, had a lot of fun and a lot of sex. It wasn&#146;t
        just the socialising. I studied hard and was particularly interested
        in surgery. I watched many operations and even assisted in a few... 
      &#147;But I had to quit after only two years because my father died.
        Suddenly I was responsible for a business empire on three continents
        and a fortune of two hundred million dollars. I sold off a few companies
        I wasn&#146;t interested in and came back here, to my childhood home.
        Now I take care of the family business from here... 
      &#147;You&#146;re sexually submissive, aren&#146;t you Jessica? You
        like to be dominated and you are turned on by bondage. True?&#148; 
      Jessica shook her head in denial, praying that Cavallo would stop playing
        with her nipple like that. 
      &#147;You are! And that&#146;s why you&#146;re in this position now.
        Rabbit Island chose you for those qualities, and they were right. I&#146;ve
        seen how you behave around men. Like when Master Alex took you to that
        ballroom one evening and you sat at his feet, wearing his chains. You
        loved it. Admit it!&#148; Cavallo almost became angry as she sought out
        a meaningless confession. 
      &#147;Is this about Master Alex?&#148; Jessica ventured. 
      Cavallo laughed extravagantly, mocking Jessica for thinking such nonsense. &#147;Of
        course it isn&#146;t, you silly pony. It&#146;s about my avocation, adapting
        the human body for sexual slavery, and about your suitability to become
        my next true ponygirl. I use the word &#145;true&#146; because a ponygirl,
        like any other true slave, should be modified to suit her function. A
        ponygirl has no need for arms. They are an unnecessary hindrance, create
        extra work for handlers and look unsightly. From now on we&#146;ll take
        care of everything for you. All you have to do is run, obey instructions
        and look beautiful. I&#146;m confident you can do all three. In return
        we&#146;ll feed you, dress you and bathe you. Everyone will admire your
        beauty. I almost envy you... 
      &#147;Envy me? You&#146;re crazy.&#148; Jessica muttered, continuing
        to tug against her wrist straps, not because of any hope of escaping,
        but to show she would not submit willingly. 
      &#147;I&#146;m not crazy, just lucky enough to know the thrill of true
        power is. I&#146;ll bet millions of people fantasize about owning an
        island like this one and be able to fully indulge their sexual tastes.
        They wouldn&#146;t do it as well as I do. I was brought up on this island
        and rode ponygirls years before I ever traveled in an automobile. I was
        driving and whipping ponygirls by the age of ten and was helping out
        in the breeding shed in my early teens. I performed my first caesarean
        at fifteen and had been involved in a dozen or more births by the age
        of sixteen.&#148; 
      &#147;Father made sure I stayed a virgin until I was sixteen. He stitched
        up my vagina himself. He knew I&#146;d want sex the moment I was unstitched.
        How could I not be affected by sexual activity around me? When the time
        came, on my sixteenth birthday, he was confident that I had developed
        dominant sexual characteristics just by the way I handled a whip... 
      &#147;He was partially right. Who wouldn&#146;t enjoy wielding a whip
        on a slave&#146;s back once taught how to do it properly? Have you ever
        whipped anyone, Jessica?&#148; 
      &#147;No!&#148; 
      &#147;But I bet you wanted to whip somebody?&#148; 
      &#147;Only you!&#148; 
      Cavallo laughed. &#147;Cute, but that&#146;s one ambition you&#146;ll
        never fulfil. Not even my father whipped me. He feared I might develop
        a taste for it. He firmly believed our childhood experiences formed our
        sexual orientations. For that reason he never allowed me to be tied up.
        I was always curious about bondage though. Sometimes I saw ecstasy on
        bound women&#146;s faces when a man made love to them and I wanted to
        experience it for myself... 
      &#147;So, not long after my sixteenth birthday I asked a handler to
        chain me up and fuck me like I&#146;d seen him do to a slavegirl. He
        was happy to oblige and suggested the hanging peach position. He wrapped
        leather cuffs around my wrists and ankles, fixed them to either side
        of a spreader bar, and cranked it up. I&#146;m sure you know what I mean.
        When I was at the perfect height for him, with my legs spread high and
        wide, he fucked me. That straining on my poor hurting limbs as my very
        first orgasm washed over me was the best feeling ever.&#148; She looked
        up towards the ceiling at the blissful recollection. &#147;but father
        had the man killed of course.&#148; 
      Jessica was become flustered and confused by Cavallo&#146;s revelations
        as she thought back to her own similarly ecstatic moments. She was close
        to tears &#147;Why are you telling me all this?&#148; 
      Cavallo took Jessica&#146;s hand. &#147;I want you to understand that
        I&#146;m doing this operation for you as well as me. You will be able
        to live the rest of your life as an erotic fantasy, never to worry about
        the real world again.&#148; 
      Jessica tried to wrench her hand from Cavallo&#146;s but the wrist strap
        wouldn&#146;t allow it. &#147;That&#146;s not what I want! You have no
        right to do this to me. I belong to Rabbit Island!&#148; 
      &#147;That&#146;s true, you are their property... but like any other
        property you can be bought and sold. I&#146;ll pay for you of course.
        The same goes for your friend in the breeding shed. The one with the
        big mouth. As soon as we confirm she is pregnant she&#146;ll also be
        having an operation.&#148; Cavallo paused, as if waiting for Jessica&#146;s
        question. 
      &#147;What kind of operation?&#148; 
      &#147;Her tongue will be removed.&#148; Cavallo announced coolly. &#147;We&#146;ve
        performed this little operation many times before. She&#146;ll be more
        manageable and in the long run she&#146;ll be happier for it. But enough
        of her, she is of little importance compared to you, my beautiful ponygirl.
        Now just try to relax. I promise you won&#146;t feel any pain either
        during the operation or afterwards.&#148; 
      Cavallo gripped Jessica&#146;s hand tightly, both knowing she would
        be the last person that ever held it. &#147;The surgeon will be here
        soon, but don&#146;t worry, I&#146;ll be here throughout the operation.&#148; 
      Right on cue they heard steps approaching from outside. Cavallo rearranged
        the expression on her face, let go of Jessica&#146;s hand and stood ready
        to greet the surgeon and his team. 
      It was not a surgeon but a nurse who walked through the door. She looked
        vaguely familiar to Cavallo but didn&#146;t recognise the smile. Behind
        Kate was Rachel, looking nervous but determined. 
      &#147;Talk of the devil!&#148; Cavallo said, impressed and amused by
        Kate&#146;s audacity. &#147;Your operation isn&#146;t &#145;til tomorrow.
        You will be punished for this. Severely punished.&#148; 
      Kate and Rachel weren&#146;t listening. Rachel had the tazer pointing
        like a gun as she stalked around one side of the operating table. Kate
        held a syringe in her hand as she approached Cavallo on the other. Cavallo
        laughed wildly as if it were just a childish game, her eyes darting between
        Kate to Rachel as she decided which one to barge past. She was bigger
        and stronger than either. Fearing the tazer in Rachel&#146;s shaking
        hand she rushed headlong at Kate, her hands jabbed forward sending Kate
        tumbling backwards to the floor. 
      Cavallo hadn&#146;t seen the cleaner kneeling by the door, she seldom
        every notice them. Karen tightly hugged Cavallo&#146;s legs as she tried
        to pass. They reached a stalemate - Cavallo unable to free herself from
        Karen&#146;s grip, and Karen unable to topple her in the way she&#146;d
        done to others in the breeding shed. The tight-fitting leather hood provided
        protection from Cavallo&#146;s desperate blows onto her head.  
      Rachel approached tentatively with the tazer. Karen mmmphed her encouragement
        for Rachel to use it as Cavallo continued beat her around the head. Rachel
        feared that Karen would get as much of an electric shock as Cavallo if
        she applied the tazer while they were so tightly joined. 
      Cavallo gave up hitting Karen&#146;s head only so she could use her
        arms to fend off the tazer prod. She was primed like a cobra, ready to
        strike it from Rachel&#146;s trembling hand as soon as it came within
        arms length. Such was her concentration that didn&#146;t noticed the
        needle in her buttock. She soon began to feel its effect. Kate stood
        up just in time to catch the slumping Cavallo, easing her gently to the
        floor. 
      The room was suddenly quiet. All Kate could hear was her own palpitating
        heart as she contemplated what she had done; not knowing if it was a
        triumph or the biggest mistake she would ever make. Then she saw Jessica
        looking at her with a face the picture of joy. 
      &#147;You weren&#146;t much help, just lying there while we did the
        fighting!&#148; She joked, then kissed Jessica lovingly on the mouth. &#147;But
        no problem Jessi. Let&#146;s get you out of here!&#148; 
      &#147;To where?&#148; 
      &#147;Good question, Jessi. I haven&#146;t thought that far ahead, but
        let&#146;s bugger off before the surgeon arrives.&#148; 
      Kate and Rachel unstrapped Jessica&#146;s wrists and ankles on their
        respective sides. 
      Jessica was confused. &#147;Katie, how did you suddenly become a nurse?&#148; 
      &#147;Call it ambition!&#148; Then Kate turned to Rachel. &#147;Handcuff
        her!&#148; 
      Rachel was confused. &#147;What?&#148; 
      &#147;Handcuffs! They&#146;re in a pouch on your belt.&#148; Kate replied,
        slightly exasperated, &#147;Put them on Jessica and go back to the breeding
        shed... now...hurry! I&#146;ll stay here to cut poor old Karen out of
        her cleaner costume.&#148; 
      Jessica trusted Kate implicitly, and being required to remain naked
        and cuffed didn&#146;t bother her much. She had grown too accustomed
        to it. Rachel led Jessica from the surgery, grabbing her arm as forcefully
        as Brenda&#146;s dykes might have. 
      Kate reached for one of the heavy surgical blades and looked down at
        Karen kneeling in front of her. &#147;You&#146;re not bothered about
        a little blood are you?&#148; 
      Karen shook her head. 
      &#147;Good! Then you can stay and help me.&#148;  
      The scalpel she wielded sliced through Karen&#146;s hood as if it were
        made of butter. 
       
      CHARLIE&#146;S SLAVE EMPORIUM 
      &#147;It&#146;s over there,&#148; Alex said to Vince as their hire car
        crept along an industrial backstreet in Bangkok. 
      Vince scrutinised the small loading bay with a door to its side. &#147;I
        don&#146;t recognise it.&#148; 
      &#147;You wouldn&#146;t. Charlie&#146;s probably moved five times since
        you last visited him,&#148; said Alex without exaggeration. This Chinaman&#146;s
        slave-tending operation seldom stayed in the same location for more than
        a few months. Vince pulled up alongside a black Mercedes. 
      Alex got out, walked up a couple of steps and buzzed the intercom. He
        turned to Vince whilst waiting for a response. &#147;Back up the car
        to the loading bay. I&#146;ll be out again in five minutes.&#148;  
      After a pause, the door buzzed indicating it could be pulled open. Alex
        entered cautiously into the loading hall. It was packed with pallets
        of Chinese canned soup. There was nothing to arouse suspicion that this
        was anything other than an unremarkable trading company. That&#146;s
        the way Charlie liked it. Alex knew Charlie also liked basements, so
        when he spotted a flight of steps leading downwards he sensed that was
        where he would find Charlie and his cages. 
      The scene had a reassuring familiarity for Alex - ten slave cages were
        lined up in the middle of the floor allowing for all-round inspection. 
      Charlie&#146;s normal exuberant greeting was substituted this time by
        a restrained shake of the hand. Alex was not the only visitor. Charlie
        was conducting business with two men, the owners of the Mercedes parked
        outside. 
      Sandwiched between the two sharp-suited men was a young Thai woman,
        her naked body being thoroughly and intimately examined by them. She
        wore Charlie&#146;s trademark dog-collar and leash but her hands were
        free. It&#146;s important that a purchaser can see how she reacts to
        their advances. Some slaves appear docile in cuffs but will turn into
        wildcats the moment their hands are released. This one however was soft
        and yielding, accepting her fate and hoping to avoid a beating that would
        result from misbehaviour. 
      Alex watched the scene from a respectful distance. She was a beautiful
        creature, even with the distressed look on her face as latex-gloved hands
        violated her sex. With long silky black hair, nice tits and slim but
        not too skinny body, she would make a good everyday whore, the sort that
        most men, white or Asian, would find appealing. 
      The two businessmen spoke to Charlie in Thai: 
      &#147;We&#146;ll take her.&#148; 
      &#147;Very good choice. You want cage or body harness for her?&#148; Charlie
        asked in Thai of about the same standard as his English. 
      &#147;No, it&#146;s not necessary.&#148; 
      While one man held the naked girl tightly to his chest in a non-consensual
        tango, the other removed a pen-like object from his jacket. He jabbed
        it into the back of the girl&#146;s neck, just below her dog collar.
        She gave a pathetic gasp, and then lost consciousness. Her dancing partner
        continued to hold her limp body upright against his. The man replaced
        the tranquilizer pen in his jacket and pulled out two plastic cable ties.
        He pulled the girl&#146;s lifeless arms behind her back and looped a
        cable tie tightly around her wrists. He bent down and fixed her ankles
        similarly. Charlie removed her dog collar and leash. She was ready for
        transportation. 
      While the paperwork was being finalised Alex inspected the latest incarnation
        of Charlie&#146;s slave emporium. Alongside one wall was a portable gas
        stove, boxes of food, crates of two-litre plastic water bottles - feeding
        and watering twelve slaves and himself was a serious undertaking. Nearby
        was a television, watched avidly by Charlie and his slavegirls during
        their long evenings. At the end of the large room was a double mattress
        on an improvised plinth of soup cans. The bed was covered by a neatly
        spread duvet cover. A good slave keeper must be a good home-maker too. 
      The other side of the room had some exercise equipment. Alex had seen
        Charlie&#146;s multi-gym and rowing machine before, but the treadmill
        was a new addition. By happy coincidence it was at that momnt being used
        by a naked woman with pale skin, American or British Alex assumed. Her
        skin glistened with accumulated sweat. She was walking fast, having no
        choice in the matter; metal cuffs attached her wrists to the respective
        rails on each side of the treadmill. Alex enjoyed watching her overweight
        rump in motion - like a cow chewing grass, he thought. 
      She didn&#146;t turn her head to look at Alex. She couldn&#146;t, because
        Charlie had adapted a ponygirl&#146;s bridle for her. The chin-strap
        of the bridle was connected by a two-foot chain to the treadmill&#146;s
        LED display in front of her. The bridle&#146;s blinkers precluded her
        from any sideways glances, obliging her to concentrate on her preprogrammed
        exercise regime. She still had twenty-five minute to go, Alex noticed. 
      The transaction for the Thai girl had concluded. They paid by cheque,
        the equivalent of 20,000 cans of soup, and Charlie gave an appropriate
        receipt. The man holding the girl hoisted her effortlessly onto his shoulder
        and carried her from the basement, while his colleague folded and pocketed
        the receipt, shook Charlie&#146;s hand with a respectful bow and departed. 
      Alex hardly noticed the men leaving. He was engrossed by the woman&#146;s
        progress on the treadmill, and wondering whether Rabbit Island should
        acquire some more exercise equipment. He was also somewhat mesmerised
        by her bobbing breasts. 
      &#147;Fat American ass!&#148; Charlie shouted from the other side of
        the cages. 
      &#147;Who? Me?&#148; Alex asked, pretending to be offended before smiling
        warmly at his old friend. 
      &#147;No. You slim American ass! SHE fat American ass,&#148; Charlie
        said, pointing a stubby finger at the poor woman on the treadmill. &#147;Very
        good for her Thai men don&#146;t eat girls or I sell her easy.&#148; 
      &#147;I wouldn&#146;t mind a slice of that rump,&#148; Alex joked, directing
        it as much to the woman as to Charlie. 
      &#147;She lost five kilos in two weeks. Five more more to go. Good diet,
        lot of exercise, no problem.&#148; 
      They left her to complete the exercise program, and Alex skipped up
        the stairs to summon Vince to come down to the basement. 
      Vince entered with their two recent acquisitions. They both had their
        hair intricately woven into long braids, giving them a tribal look, although
        one was too fair skinned to be a native from those parts. They were naked
        and each had her hand cuffed behind her, with a chain joining the two
        together side by side. 
      &#147;Jesus, Alex, we nearly suffocated in that trunk,&#148; the fair-skinned
        one complained. 
      &#147;Do you remember this one?&#148; Alex asked Charlie, ignoring the
        girl&#146;s remark. 
      Charlie studied her face briefly and shook his head. &#147;No. Don&#146;t
        know her. She and her for sale?&#148; 
      &#147;No. I think I&#146;ll take them back to Rabbit Island when the
        repairs are done. This is Nancy. She escaped from Rabbit Island but was
        then kidnapped. We had to pay a ransom to get her back.&#148; 
      Charlie was impressed. &#147;Ohhhh, Miss Houdini. Don&#146;t worry I
        give her extra chains! No-one ever escape from me.&#148; 
      While Vince&#146;s attention was taken by the woman on the treadmill
        Charlie gave Alex a tour of his caged slaves. It was part of slave traders&#146; etiquette
        to cast an expert eye over each other&#146;s merchandise. The slaves
        followed Charlie&#146;s presentation routine. They knelt on their shins,
        with a straight back and head held high. The leash connecting the dog
        collar to the top bars made it difficult for them to do anything else.  
      &#147;Any virgins?&#148; Alex asked. 
      They moved to a cage containing a white girl. &#147;This one!&#148; Charlie
        said proudly. &#147;American virgin.&#148; 
      The girl&#146;s head hung downwards, her straight blonde hair covering
        her face and her shame. Charlie tapped her under the chin with his riding
        crop. She raised her head, shaking it to clear the hair from her face
        and showing both the red ballgag in her mouth and the rage in her eyes.
        The privileged American teenager didn&#146;t take to her captivity with
        the passive acceptance shown by the Asian girls, but with the right training
        she would become an excellent whore or sex slave just the same. The fire
        of loathing in her expression impressed Alex as much as her fine young
        body. 
      They were reaching the end of the line of cages. &#147;You remember
        this one?&#148; Charlie asked. 
      Alex studied the cage&#146;s occupant. She was far from being a teenager,
        attractive for her obvious thirty-something years, but there wasn&#146;t
        a demand for older slaves, certainly not in Charlie&#146;s market sector. &#147;No.
        Give me a clue!&#148;  
      &#147;Remember drug whore last month? Shaking with no drug?&#148; 
      Alex smiled, remembering Charlie&#146;s amusing phrase. &#147;What?
        Cold chicken?&#148; 
      &#147;This is her. Now clean and good health. Very good. Help me with
        cook and clean.&#148; Charlie opened the cage door, unwound the leash
        handle from the cage bars and helped the woman to her feet. It was strange
        that Charlie would be trying to present this one to Alex. Her skin was
        scarred from cuts and cigarette burns inflicted in her past, while her
        teeth had had more attention from a man&#146;s fist than a dentist over
        the years. 
      &#147;She say likes tied-up and chains, and whipping too. She say want
        to go to Rabbit Island. So I tie and beat her, test her truth, but I
        not so sure. Think she faker.&#148; 
      Alex pitied the woman standing before him, wondering why anyone would
        lie about such a thing? 
      &#147;You&#146;re too old to be a Rabbit Island slavegirl,&#148; he
        said apologetically. A tear trickled down her cheek almost immediately, &#147;but
        I have a man who works for me on Rabbit Island. A Filipino, and a good
        and loyal worker. Last year his wife died, and he needs a woman to live
        with. You can be his new wife.&#148; 
      It isn&#146;t often that one can bring such happiness to somebody, but
        at that moment Alex did. Her ecstatic smile said it all. After twenty
        years as an enslaved whore she was to become somebody&#146;s wife. It
        was something she had alway dreamed of. With her hands locked behind
        her all she could do was fall to her knees in front of Alex and kiss
        his shoes. Charlie tugged on her leash, and returned the joyful woman
        to her cage. Alex enjoyed having power over women, the power to train
        and punish but also like now, the power to bring happiness. 
      &#147;How the hell does she know about Rabbit Island anyhow?&#148; Alex
        asked. 
      Charlie pointed an accusing finger at the neighbouring cage. &#147;That
        one tell her.&#148; 
      &#147;Hello Doctor Alex,&#148; said Janie, her face shifting with various
        emotions. She was happy for her caged neighbour but her underlying sadness
        was apparent. &#147;My memory is returning. I can remember things, lots
        of things!&#148; 
      Alex was unsure whether that constituted good news or not. &#147;You
        remember Rabbit Island? But I&#146;m sure you were never there.&#148; 
      &#147;I only know of it from other people. I was somewhere else but
        I can&#146;t remember the name. An island. I remember a woman who owned
        it - Cavaro.&#148; 
      &#147;Cavallo?&#148; Alex prompted. 
      &#147;Cavallo. She did this to me.&#148; Janie broke into sobs. &#147;I
        don&#146;t want to remember any more. Can you give me something to help
        me forget again?&#148; 
      Alex gulped his saliva, glancing at Vince who was also listening intently. &#147;Janie,
        are you sure?&#148; 
      &#147;I&#146;m positive. How could I invent someone like Cavallo? I
        wouldn&#146;t want to.&#148; 
      Vince stuck his hand through the bars and pulled Janie&#146;s hair back
        so she looked upwards. &#147;Open your mouth!&#148; 
      He used a finger to feel inside her mouth, and a moment later turned
        to Alex. &#147;She hasn&#146;t any back teeth. It&#146;s likely she was
        a Cavallo ponygirl.&#148; 
      Alex agreed. 
      &#147;Did we send any of our ponygirls to her?&#148; Vince asked. 
      &#147;Just one, and four bunnies, but she wouldn&#146;t dare harm them.
        Besides, we&#146;ll be collecting them in a couple of weeks.&#148; 
      Charlie soon had Nancy and Lina accommodated in their cages, fixing
        Nancy (or &#145;Houdini girl&#146; as he renamed her) in ankle shackles
        as well as the usual cuff and collar arrangement. &#147;So you come back
        and collect your four women in two weeks?&#148; 
      &#147;Three weeks before we are back here,&#148; Alex corrected him. &#147;then
        we&#146;ll collect Nancy, Lina, Janie and our lovely new bride. Don&#146;t
        sell them!&#148; 
      Charlie laughed at the very thought. Two women who looked like they
        should be in the jungle, another without arms, and the superannuated
        whore Alex had married off to one of his workers. He thought Alex had
        gone soft. 
      TABLES TURNED 
      Kate was right in insisting that Jessica should be Rachel&#146;s prisoner.
        They walked right past one of the male handlers on the way back to the
        breeding shed without attracting any attention, other than the man getting
        an eyeful of Jessica&#146;s naked body. 
      Once inside the breeding shed Jessica was freed from the handcuffs. 
      &#147;I want clothes like yours.&#148; Jessica joked, fingering Rachel&#146;s
        dungarees. 
      She didn&#146;t have long to wait. As soon as Rachel handed over the
        tazer prod Jessica took over. One of the breeders had to give up her
        frame to accommodate another one of Brenda&#146;s girls. 
      Three hours later Kate and Karen still hadn&#146;t returned to the breeding
        shed. Jessica was hardly able to run for it with her cracked ankle, so
        there was no alternative but to wait and hope. A refrigerator full of
        sodas was raided to create a party atmosphere, aided by some amusing
        entertainment that their captured former keepers were providing. 
      A sudden assault on the breeding shed brought an end to their laughter.
        Three men armed with pistols burst through the door. Jessica and Rachel
        dropped their tazers and raised their hands. The three naked and newly
        pregnant women they had released from their frames subtly distanced themselves
        by a few metres, implicating Jessica and Rachel, not just as ringleaders
        but solely responsible for the current situation. Cowardly behaviour
        perhaps, but who could blame them in the circumstances? They hadn&#146;t
        ask to be freed. 
      There was a hint of amusement behind the stern expressions of the gun-toting
        men. 
      &#147;One, two, three, four, five of you.&#148; One of the men counted
        with a point of his gun, &#147;but no empty breeding frames?&#148; 
      He looked down the line of kneeling figures, all securely chained, all
        hooded except one. This one was making something of a commotion. 
      &#147;Jesus! It&#146;s Brenda!&#148; 
      Brenda&#146;s noises were involuntary and incomprehensible. Jessica
        and Rachel had decided some revenge was in order and had just the tools
        for the job. Nestled between Brenda&#146;s ample rump the inseminator
        was pumping away on a long stroke, with its dreaded tremble option enabled.
        At the other end the milking machine was having limited success in extracting
        any goodness from her dangling breasts, even though their size promised
        so much more. The harness ballgag that so often tormented Kate was now
        tormenting her nemesis; the straps dug deeply into the abundant flesh
        of Brenda&#146;s rotund and reddened face. 
      &#147;She looks like a boiler about to blow,&#148; said one of the men. 
      &#147;It would be cruel to interrupt her now,&#148; another replied.
        They could interpret neither Brenda&#146;s grunts nor her bewildered,
        crossed-eyed expression. They figured it was safer to leave her to run
        her orgasmic course while they searched for the other workers-turned-prisoners. 
      Removing the hoods of the breeders one by one, the pattern started to
        emerge: Their colleagues were the ones gagged and dazed, having each
        been given a sedative jab. One of their colleagues was easy to spot,
        due to the broad hairy back that couldn&#146;t be hidden by the breeders&#146; flimsy
        baby-doll dress. 
      &#147;Steve?&#148; 
      He strained to look up at them, gagged and bewildered, though his confusion
        rapidly turned to embarrassment. The iron breeding frame and shackles
        holding him in the breeders face-down kneeling position easily contained
        his frantic struggles. 
      One man produced a camera. &#147;We&#146;d better produce some evidence,&#148; he
        announced trying to hide his gleeful smile. &#147;Look up at the camera
        Steve, then we&#146;ll get you free.&#148; 
      Steve was freed just in time to witness Brenda&#146;s earthquake of
        an orgasm. Her rhythmic grunting and growling was more reminiscent of
        a man or a wild animal than a woman, yet all the witnesses, male and
        female, found something peculiarly sexy about her reluctant performance.
        Her unlikely erotic show stopped when the inseminator&#146;s timer shut
        it off. They were wrong if they thought Brenda&#146;s mechanical rape
        would have softened her. She battled against her frame with a fury and
        strength far greater than Steve&#146;s. The men promptly released her
        before she developed revengeful thoughts for each of them. She did, after
        all, hold the keys to the penis restraints they wore. 
      While Brenda skulked off behind a partition to dress in her dungarees
        the three breeders were locked back in their frames. There seemed to
        be some confusion after the nurse had been freed from her frame; she
        was screaming about what had happened to her uniform. Having already
        relinquished her breeder&#146;s dress the nurse wore nothing but a naked
        rage of indignation, much like Brenda&#146;s but smaller and with perkier
        breasts. She ran deliriously from the breeding shed in a mad scene all
        of her own. 
      Brenda took charge again, stopping the men from releasing Billy, the
        fifth and final staff member, from her frame. She crouched down and stroked
        Billy&#146;s ball-gagged and tear-stained face. &#147;It&#146;s all your
        fault Billy, because you were the first one they captured. I have to
        punish you or people might accuse me of favouritism. So I&#146;m going
        to leave you locked in this breeding frame for the next seven days.&#148; 
      Billy sobbed, while Brenda was holding back her emotion too as she stood
        up to deal with the two remaining culprits, Jessica and Rachel. 
      &#147;She&#146;s not a fucking breeder,&#148; Brenda screamed at the
        men just as they were fixing Jessica into a breeding frame. &#147;Look!
        Ringed nipples! She&#146;s a ponygirl, so why the hell she&#146;s in
        here I have no idea!&#148; 
      With their shaved hair and uniform piercings, ponygirls looked much
        the same to those, like Brenda, who didn&#146;t work with them every
        day. But then she saw Jessica&#146;s heavily strapped ankle, and suddenly
        went pale. A visible shiver ran down her spine as she realised that this
        ponygirl was supposed to be in the operating theatre. 
      The nurse returned, still naked, and in a worse state than when she
        left the breeding shed a few minutes earlier. She was screaming, &#147;Something
        terrible has happened, something truly terrible!&#148; 
       
      HANGING AROUND 
      Jessica, Rachel, Kate and Karen were reunited in a dungeon not long
        after. 
      Four stone pillars in a row, each separated by about a metre, held the
        four naked women. Iron shackles, a permanent fixture on the pillars,
        held their wrists above their heads, obliging them to remain standing.
        There was just enough slack for Jessica to bend a hand down to scratch
        her nose. Tales of their adventures kept them going, particularly Kate&#146;s
        gruesome tale. 
      &#147;After you and Rachel went back to the breeding shed I cut Karen
        out of her cleaning restraints just as I said I would. I looked at Cavallo
        lying on the operating table. She even looked evil while she slept. It
        made my blood boil to think of what she was going to do to you Jessi.
        I asked Karen whether she minded the sight of blood. She said she didn&#146;t... 
      &#147;So once I&#146;d found theatre gowns and masks my mind was made
        up. We undressed the bitch and threw her clothes in the furnace, then
        we shaved her head so she looked like you. Karen did a great job... 
      &#147;Then the surgical team arrived. I&#146;d been in operating theatres
        many times before and this wasn&#146;t my first amputation, although
        it was for poor Karen. The surgeon was excellent, the best money can
        buy, I&#146;m sure. What can I say? The operation was a success!&#148; 
      &#147;And here we are in the dungeon!&#148; said Rachel, wondering might
        be their fate after such an escapade. Nobody dared answer. 
      Jessica&#146;s bawdy tale of how they got Brenda in a breeding frame
        lightened the mood to such an extent that Kate could have keeled over
        with laughter if it were not for the chains holding her upright. &#147;And
        I&#146;ll never forget the moment when they found the man we put in the
        frame,&#148; Jessica recalled, mimicking the man&#146;s shocked voice. &#147;Steve?&#148; 
      Evening had fallen, and the shaft of natural daylight had been replaced
        by the faint glow of an electric light somewhere outside the dungeon.
        Since being chained up no-one had attended to them with so much as a
        drink of water. Perhaps they would wait until the middle of the night
        to whip us, Jessica thought. In the meantime, spontaneous chuckles as
        they recollected their amazing day sustained them until they were too
        tired to talk. 
      Jessica dreamed of the night of her first encounter with Master Alex
        on Rabbit Island. He&#146;d left her standing in chains, a bitter sweet
        torment that felt like a beginning. By contrast, this felt like... 
       
      MORNING 
       
      All Madame Cavallo&#146;s other loyal cronies were at her bedside when
        she awoke with the morning sun. She was proud and stoical, although a
        tear sometimes rolled down her cheek, to be elegantly wiped away by one
        of her handmaids. Lucinda was busy at the dressing table making a wig
        for her mistress. 
      &#147;The culprits are chained up in the dungeon Madame,&#148; said
        Brenda in an attempt to cheer up her employer. &#147;What would you like
        us to do with them?&#148; 
      Cavallo didn&#146;t reply immediately, in fact several tense minutes
        elapsed. Nobody spoke while Madame Cavallo was carefully considering
        her options. Finally she turned her head slowly towards the man standing
        to her right, the island&#146;s General Foreman. With an expression neither
        angry nor smiling she gave her answer: 
      &#147;Prepare the guillotine.&#148;

      THE DUNGEON 
      Jessica had endured many more painful punishments, but never one that
        left her as exhausted and dispirited as this. The joking and bravado
        which characterised their first evening turned to despair as the four
        column-chained prisoners sought comfort and rest where there was none.
        Jessica could either face her pillar, rubbing bare breasts against the
        stone pillar, or turn her back to lean against it. All night long she
        alternated restlessly between the two positions. 
      Judging by the light shining obliquely into the dungeon, the morning
        was several hours old before somebody came to visit them. Brenda entered
        carrying a bucket of water and an enamel mug. 
      Kate plucked up the courage to ask what was going to happen to them. 
      &#147;It&#146;s a surprise,&#148; said Brenda, stuffing bread into Kate&#146;s
        mouth, then tipping the mug of water down her throat. She left before
        Kate had cleared her throat to ask another question. The door closed
        with a heavy bang, then the key was turned, reminding them of their hopeless
        plight. 
      The day passed slowly, mainly in silence, as Jessica, Kate, Rachel and
        Karen became lost in their own thoughts. They were more likely to hear
        the splash of urine between spread feet than any conversation. A network
        of hollow channels in the floor effortlessly drained away their spillage,
        as it had for countless other prisoners in the last hundred years. 
      The evening brought no respite save for another mouthful of bread, another
        mug of water. A bucket of water was thrown over Kate&#146;s feet, she
        was the only one who needed that small mercy to clear away the mess she
        had made of herself many hours before. 
      Karen complained of hunger, initiating the conversation they were trying
        to avoid. &#147;Pizza! I wonder if we can order a pizza. Pepperoni for
        me!&#148; 
      &#147;Enchiladas,&#148; Rachel offered, &#147;with beans.&#148; 
      &#147;Spaghetti bolognese!&#148; Jessica chipped in, &#147;with lots
        of Parmesan.&#148; 
      &#147;I&#146;d give my right arm for a full English breakfast!&#148; said
        Kate. Her comment was greeted with silence until, for the first time
        that day, they laughed. Black humour was all that was left to them. 
      Their interlude of conversation turned to the food on Rabbit Island
        and then to life in general on the island. Karen&#146;s memories were
        brief and unpleasant but the others found many things to reminisce about.
        However bad, it was what bonded them together. 
      &#147;It sounds crazy but I&#146;d love to see that beach again,&#148; Rachel
        said wistfully, &#147;that warm sea, the sand between my toes, the good
        friends, it was fun.&#148; 
      &#147;Aren&#146;t you forgetting about the beatings, the bondage, the
        humiliation, the rapes?&#148; Karen interjected. 
      Rachel defended her position. &#147;I am, I suppose. But they sure knew
        how to get the right reaction from me. Did you know they kept detailed
        notes on how we responded to their various situations? Then they tailored
        our treatment to what they considered our preferences. After a while
        it was more like forced orgasm than rape. What can I say? Sometimes I
        liked it! I&#146;m sure it was helped by the drugs they gave us. I&#146;ve
        never wanted sex as much as when I was on Rabbit Island. When I was on
        the beach with my hands locked behind me I&#146;d often rub myself up
        against a coconut tree or anything else I could put my thighs around.
        I swear to god I was nothing but a bitch in heat on many days!&#148; 
      Jessica noticed that Rachel was becoming animated in her tale, opening
        up far more than usual. It was as if she felt compelled to talk about
        it. &#147;Sometimes when we were in the beach cabin we&#146;d be deliberately
        mischievous when the pony driver came with our meals, just so he could
        punish us, even though it wasn&#146;t exactly punishment we wanted. All
        I wanted was a man&#146;s cock, and any way would do!&#148; 
      Kate squirmed with arousal against her pillar. She knew the feeling
        very well. Her mind turning to thoughts of Ray, the pony driver who hit
        his head in a fall - the one she and Jessica rescued. She was feeling
        guilty that her desire for a man&#146;s body had so easily transferred
        to Riccardo. 
      Jessica and Kate looked sympathetically at each other in the evening
        gloom. Each pitied the other, seeing her wrists being cut into by the
        iron manacles, as if they were meat hanging up to dry. When they were
        awake it wasn&#146;t a problem - just stand up straight with your belly
        again the stone pillar and the shackles won&#146;t hurt - but at night,
        when they wanted so badly to sleep, they had all succumbed to hanging
        by their wrists just to give their legs a rest. 
      They had learned the terrible difference between suffering and erotic
        torment. 
       
      HAVE A CIGAR 
      They stood at their pillars for four nights. The last day and night
        being more miserable, pathetic and despairing that anything they had
        ever known. 
         
      On the fifth morning it changed. Brenda and Thelma - her new sidekick
        now that Billy was in the breeding shed - came into the dungeon each
        carrying a heap of old leather garments, heavy enough that they immediately
        dropped them to the floor once inside the cell. 
      &#147;I think you&#146;ve been standing around long enough,&#148; said
        Brenda. &#147;It&#146;s time for a rest.&#148; 
      Gradually the four prisoners roused themselves from semi-consciousness
        as Brenda held up a shapeless brown leather garment. 
      &#147;This is a cigar,&#148; she announced, laying it on the ground
        while Thelma unlocked Jessica&#146;s shackles. &#147;I expect after four
        days standing you would like to lie down.&#148; 
      The words &#145;lie down&#146; sounded like a siren&#146;s call. Jessica
        was too weak to resist as she was made to lay face down on the leather
        sheath. Thelma pulled Jessica&#146;s weary arms behind her and snagged
        her wrists together with two interlocking plastic cable ties. Her ankles
        were crossed and likewise joined. 
      Then the lacing began. From ankles to neck Brenda and Thelma laced Jessica
        into the leather. For five busy minutes they tugged out every millimetre
        of slack from the criss-crossed laces. In parts the garment didn&#146;t
        close fully leaving small diamonds of Jessica&#146;s back exposed, although
        not for want of trying by Brenda. The cigar had a collar that folded
        down over where the laces finally knotted at the back of Jessica&#146;s
        neck. A small padlock threaded through two metal-grommeted holes to ensure
        the lacing would not be tampered with. 
      Jessica struggled to take in enough breath as the cigar squeezed her
        body like a python. She could barely bend at the knees and hips, yet
        despite her immobility and shortness of breath it was a relief to be
        lying down at last. 
      While Jessica was being &#145;cigared&#146; Kate peed, having realised
        that it might be her last chance a while. Brenda heard the gentle splash
        and laughed.  
      &#147;Clever girl. It&#146;ll be your last chance! These cigars are
        Madame&#146;s favourite you know,&#148; Brenda casually informed them.
        She seemed in good spirits, apparently recovered from her orgasmic ordeal
        on the breeding frame, and not appearing to hold a grudge against Jessica
        for putting her in the frame. 
      Shortly afterwards four cigared females were lying side by side on the
        cell floor. &#147;Brenda, why haven&#146;t we been punished?&#148; Kate
        asked, &#147;I thought someone would have whipped our hides off by now.&#148; 
      &#147;There&#146;s no point in punishing you,&#148; said Brenda. &#147;My
        instructions were to keep you secure. It was my idea to put you in cigars
        just in case you were too exhausted before your big day.&#148; 
      Kate tried to hide the alarm in her voice. &#147;Big day? What kind
        of big day?&#148; 
      &#147;The kind of big day when people are reminded what happens to those
        who commit terrible crimes.&#148; 
      Kate lacked the courage for further questions. She had an idea what
        the big day might involve but preferred to retain the glimmer of uncertainty
        that existed as long as those words remained unspoken. 
      Much else would also go unspoken - Thelma was cutting four long strips
        from a roll of three-inch surgical tape. 
      Brenda lifted Kate&#146;s chin high off the floor ensuring that her
        jaws were clamped as Thelma pressed the tape over Kate&#146;s mouth and
        cheeks. Jessica, Karen and Rachel submitted to the same treatment. 
      When Brenda left the cell, and the heavy key clanged as it turned the
        lock, there was nothing to do but sleep. 
      It was many hours before they awoke, almost dusk. Jessica glanced at
        her neighbours - Kate to her right, mmmphing something to herself as
        if devising a plan, and Rachel to her left, her eyes red with tears.
        Jessica gave her a weak grunt of comfort, then hoped that sleep would
        claim her for a few more hours. The tightness of the cigar scarcely permitted
        even the idea of a struggle, let alone any real resistance. 
      The following day brought no change in their condition, and no visitor
        except Brenda with bread and water. She inspected the row of four cigars,
        all shoulder-to-shoulder just as she left them twelve hours earlier.
        Her heavy boots passed deliberately close to their noses, leaving them
        in no doubt about their lowly status. 
      She bent down and yet still towered threateningly over them. Then she
        ripped the tape from Kate&#146;s face. 
      &#147;Water! Please!&#148; Kate croaked. 
      &#147;Silly cunt! What else do you think I&#146;m here for?&#148; She
        ripped a piece of bread of her small brown loaf and pushed it into Kate&#146;s
        mouth. Mercifully the water followed immediately behind it, soaking the
        bread and enabling Kate to swallow. Brenda caressed Kate&#146;s face
        and blonde hair as she craned her neck upwards to take on as much water
        as possible. 
      &#147;Want some juice?&#148; Brenda asked. 
      &#147;Yes please,&#148; said Kate without hesitation. 
      Brenda suddenly let go of Kate&#146;s chin, stood up, then sat down
        heavily on top of Karen. Karen groaned as the little air she had in her
        lungs was expelled by Brenda&#146;s crushing weight. Mercifully Brenda
        stood up as soon as she&#146;d removed her boots. 
      &#147;Very comfortable!&#148; she pronounced of Karen.  
      The prisoners were treated to a most unlikely striptease as Brenda unclipped
        the bib of her dungarees. They dropped around her feet directly in front
        of Kate, filling Kate&#146;s view with her fat white calves. 
      &#147;I meant pussy juice of course,&#148; Brenda chuckled, &#147;and
        if you do a good job your friends will have bread and water too!&#148; 
      Brenda sat her buttocks down on her dungarees and shuffled her ass forward
        until Kate's face was pressed against the smelly folds of flesh around
        her sex. &#147;Doesn&#146;t that feel nice?&#148; 
      &#147;Uh huh.&#148; 
      &#147;Good! Now starting making juice.&#148; Brenda rasped. 
      Kate&#146;s tongue gave a tentative lick and used her chin and nose
        to stimulate the region. Then, as her tongue loosened and Kate became
        used to Brenda&#146;s taste, she licked deeper and deeper between the
        labial folds, then withdrew it onto Brenda&#146;s sizeable clitoris.
        When she felt Brenda&#146;s finger gripping her short hair, Kate was
        happy in the knowledge that Jessica, Rachel and Karen would soon have
        their bread and water. 
      The days spent in Cervoix&#146;s class &#145;Oral Training for Slavegirls&#146; proved
        invaluable as Kate put her distaste aside as she tried to bring Brenda
        to orgasm. Brenda&#146;s ever-rising moans seemed more of anger than
        pleasure, but her juice dripping from Kate&#146;s chin told a truer story.  
       Through gritted teeth and with her clenched hand almost pulling out
        Kate&#146;s hair by its roots, Brenda blasphemed her way a crude and
        lingering climax. Like a trooper, Kate continued to lick even after Brenda&#146;s
        palpitations had subsided. 
       Brenda stood up, as happy as someone who&#146;d just been expertly
        fucked. Only after she had put on her dungarees did she notice the prominent
        wet patches. It put paid to any notion she might have had of making a
        quick exit, knowing that she would encounter other people on her way
        out of the dungeon. 
      She replaced the tape over Kate&#146;s mouth without offering her so
        much as a swig of water. Then, keeping her word, she fed and watered
        the other three, taking her time as she waited for the wet patches to
        dry. 
       
      THE BIG DAY 
      The next morning they were roused by the banging of hammers and the
        whine of rotary saws. Something was happening outside. They were constructing
        something large, to judge by the calls and shouts of workers.  
      A stage! Jessica definitely heard them talking about a stage. Cameras
        and lighting were also mentioned. A look between her and Kate was enough:
        They knew they would be taking part in whatever kind of show it was,
        and that Madame Cavallo would have her retribution. 
      The cell door opened, and two burly men dressed in construction workers&#146; checked
        shirts and jeans entered. &#147;There they are,&#148; one said as if
        he had spotted the wooden planks he was looking for, although by then
        the girls looked no more attractive than a wooden plank, and smelt a
        good deal worse. 
      High up on the back of a cigar there is a leather grab handle. Lifting
        one woman in each hand them men dragged them from the cell, their bound
        and encased feet trailing on the floor behind them. For Jessica, with
        her fractured ankle, the pain was excruciating as she was bounced up
        a short flight of steps to ground level. 
      A ponygirl trailer was parked outside waiting. They were secured onto
        its flat bed and netted over. Four bound-up bunnies constituted a light
        load, Jessica thought to herself as the pony trap lurched unsteadily
        into motion. The gentle &#145;hyar&#146; of encouragement by the pony
        driver was unmistakable. Jessica had heard it hundreds, perhaps thousands
        of times. No longer did she wonder what had happened to Riccardo. Her
        spirits lifted. Surely he wouldn&#146;t let anything terrible happen
        to them, would he? 
      The ponygirls picked up their pace as they headed for the doctor&#146;s
        surgery, but Jessica still wasn&#146;t impressed. She could do much better
        than these... if they would only give her another chance. 
      Rubbing leather-encased shoulders with Jessica, Kate&#146;s thoughts
        were not about ponygirl performance, but pony driver performance.
        She was convinced Riccardo was planning something to help them, perhaps
        taking them to another part of the island where he would help them escape.
        It wasn&#146;t to be. They stopped at the surgery. The infamous surgery. 
       
      PREPARATIONS 
      They called them cigars, but Jessica thought &#145;worm&#146; would
        be a better name, a helpless brown wriggling thing at ground level. Watching
        the parade of shoes passing by inches away from her nose she was left
        in no doubt about her worm-like status. A familiar pair of white heels
        stopped in front of them. Kate craned her neck to look up the slim white-stockinged
        legs. The stocking tops and garter fixings came into view even before
        the hem of the dress. It was very familiar to Kate, the nurse&#146;s
        uniform she had commandeered from this very same nurse last week. Kate
        envied her and longed to be wearing the tight white dress again, however
        unlikely that now seemed. 
      &#147;You&#146;ll all be dressed splendidly for your last day,&#148; the
        cheerful nurse reassured them. 
      Jessica was the first to be unlaced from her cigar. The nurse and the
        other handlers didn&#146;t hide their disgust as Jessica&#146;s body
        odour was unleashed, as if somehow she might have taken care of her personal
        hygiene.  
      She was led from the room, almost too weak to walk. After a cold shower
        and scrub they started to dress her. Much to Jessica&#146;s surprise
        she was being rigged out as a ponygirl - Rabbit Island style - even though
        they knew about her swollen ankle. She stifled her scream as her ankle
        was fitted into her ponyboot. Surely they didn&#146;t expect her to run? 
      The leather harness was lifted over her shoulders to be strapped around
        her torso. Her arms were hammerlocked behind her and buckled into a relatively
        comfortable position. Her hands were made into fists and wrapped in the
        tight netted bags so there was no chance of wriggling fingers ruining
        the aesthetics of a ponygirl&#146;s rear view. All the while somebody
        was applying make up to her face and rouging her lips with a bright red
        gloss.  
      The bridle was fitted, Jessica opening her mouth and taking the bit
        between her teeth and feeling the threaded prong of her tongue bar slip
        through the hole in the middle of the bit. The bridle straps prevented
        the removal of the steel and rubber bit but they still spun the wing
        nut onto the thread of her tongue bar. She didn&#146;t and couldn&#146;t
        resist, so conditioned was she to complying with her pony dressing. It
        wasn&#146;t enjoyable like when Riccardo was doing the dressing, but
        after a week in hell it felt oddly reassuring to be in ponygirl tack.
        Against her better judgement she became hopeful. 
      The handlers and the nurse weren&#146;t experts at ponygirl dressing
        but they managed it. Jessica stood resplendent in formal ponygirl attire,
        complete with plumed headdress and butt-plug holding a plaited tail of
        her own hair. They led her outside. 
      Riccardo was no longer there. A four-pony carriage had replaced his
        ponygirl trailer. Behind the driver were two bench seats fancing inwards,
        wide enough for two people on each side. Kate, Rachel and Karen were
        already seated, bound and gagged in their costumes, each very different
        from the other. 
      Just as they were helping Jessica into the remaining seat alongside
        Kate somebody called out: 
      &#147;Let the ponygirl run behind!&#148; 
      The suggestion was taken and Jessica was attached to the rear of the
        carriage by a three-metre rein. They set off back to the main building. 
      The pace wasn&#146;t as fast as Jessica feared, she could keep up well
        enough, because it was an intermediate speed designed for a ceremonial
        trot. The four ponygirls up front, healthy and well-drilled, executed
        their high steps with a precision that Jessica couldn&#146;t match, not
        without a searing pain in her ankle. It didn&#146;t matter, nobody demanded
        anything of her except to stay on her feet and not hold up the carriage. 
      In front of Jessica sat Kate, looking back at her sympathetically. Her
        mouth was covered with surgical tape, her eyes transmitted a rare anxiety,
        as if she had to tell her something. 
      They soon reached the main building complex with its attractive lawned
        gardens. There was to be a show, judging by the all equipment on view.
        When the carriage stopped, Jessica saw two cameramen filming them from
        various angles. Handlers helped the three prisoners down from the carriage
        giving Jessica her first look at them. 
      Kate was dressed in the same tight-fitting nurse&#146;s dress that she
        wore during her rescue but with a couple of crucial additions. As well
        as her taped mouth she had her wrists taped behind her. Even her fingers
        had been taped together just in case she harboured any more ideas of
        escape. 
      Rachel looked surprisingly elegant in a navy blue and gold evening dress
        and high heels. Her bondage was just as elegant: cleave-gagged with a
        silk scarf, and further silk scarves binding her wrists and elbows together. 
      Karen&#146;s attire was more predictable. She wore a black wet-look
        corset and stockings that accentuated her bust and shapely figure. She
        was ball-gagged and tightly bound with white cord. 
      They were made up for the cameras, Jessica realised - something for
        all tastes. The handlers were also made up for the cameras in a sense.
        They wore black half-masks that covered the head and upper half of the
        face, like executioners. 
      The half-acre lawn area had been transformed into an arena, with stages
        and props spaced around it. At the building&#146;s side was a small luxurious
        grandstand, accommodating perhaps thirty people. At their centre, in
        something akin to a royal box sat Madame Cavallo. Flanking each side
        of her were two petite women covered from head to toe in a close-fitting
        fabric. The only gap was a postbox sized opening for their eyes. 
      Today was a special day, with each event to be fully savoured by the
        assembled connoisseurs. These men and women had travelled thousands of
        miles to attend Cavallo&#146;s invitation-only event. The yachts in the
        harbour showed they had bank balances to match their extravagant tastes. 
      Jessica and her three companions were made to sit down on a long bench,
        secured with a thick chain threaded through all their bound arms. They
        were to star in the show&#146;s finale. Before that came the warmup acts. 
      How typical of Madame Cavallo to open her show with a crucifixion, just
        like the regular Friday bacchanals!  
      A naked young woman was being laid out on a wooden cross, her limbs
        and body thoroughly roped to it so that she would be firmly and safely
        held to the cross once it was in the vertical position. She didn&#146;t
        utter a sound as the nails passed through the palms of her hands and
        into the hard wood. Nor did she make a cry when her feet were nailed.
        Four men hoisted the cross up into its vertical stand. The woman winced
        with pain as the rope bit into her flesh as it took her full weight. 
      Polite applause and murmurs of appreciation emitted from around the
        grandstand. 
      &#147;We&#146;ve created permanent piercings in her hands and feet,&#148; Cavallo
        explained to her nearest neighbours. &#147;They&#146;ve almost completely
        healed so this slave can be a full-time crucifixion exhibit, providing
        she is properly secured. As you can see she is quite skinny so there
        is very little weight to be supported.&#148; 
      &#147;Is she for sale?&#148; one of the guests asked. 
      Cavallo smiled coyly. &#147;Not officially, but we all have a price.
        Speak to me later.&#148; 
      Now the crucified woman was presiding over the lawn, the show commenced. 
      A woman was crawling into view of the grandstand, led by a handler on
        a collar and leash. He took her to the middle of the lawn. Kate recognised
        her as one of her companions during her bitch-dog episode, horrified
        to discover that this woman was still with the dogs more than a month
        later. The iron bitch-frame awaited her in the middle of the lawn. She
        crawled onto the device, meekly allowing the handler to secure her wrists,
        knees and ankles into the frame&#146;s worn leather straps.  
      All the while a cameraman circled her looking for the best shots - the
        caress of straps around her slender limbs, the ambiguous expression of
        humiliation and lust upon the woman&#146;s face. He closed in on her
        dangling breasts just as the handler yanked her nipples downwards to
        meet the frame&#146;s cruel serrated clamps. The live pictures were fed
        straight to a Diamond Vision screen on the far side of the lawn. It was
        a modest display by current standards, having served in a football ground
        for several years before being replaced by more modern technology. Madame
        Cavallo picked it up for a song several years ago. 
      &#147;She&#146;ll perform without the frame, but she seems to prefer
        being strapped in,&#148; Cavallo commented to her fellow spectators, &#147;and
        who are we to deny her that small pleasure?&#148; 
      The bitch-woman squirmed in what can only be described as anticipation.
        Facing neither the grandstand nor the large screen she seemed oblivious
        to her surroundings as she waited for what had become her only pleasure
        in life. The barking dogs in the distance caused an involuntary wiggle
        of her ass, captured by the video cameras of course. 
      The first dog, a brown Doberman, was led onto the lawn, obedient but
        eager and lustful. Its handler ensured that the bitch woman received
        a rough slobbering pussy licking before allowing the dog to mount her. 
      The second dog, an English pointer, pointed the way to the bitch&#146;s
        orgasm although his brief performance left her gasping in pre-orgasm
        madness. Her face, mouth gagged with a bitch&#146;s regular bone and
        leather strap, the dilated pupils of her eyes darting involuntarily from
        side to side, showed large upon the screen for the delighted appreciation
        of the audience. 
      The third dog, a fat Saint Bernard, mounted her. Whether it was through
        her training or her own needs was open to debate as the woman finally
        reached her orgasm whilst still being vigorously pumped by the dog. She &#145;woofed&#146; loudly
        throughout her orgasm just as she had been trained. 
      While the crucified woman hung on her cross, and the bitch-woman slumped
        satisfied yet dejected in her frame, the next event got under way:  
      It was the striping contest. Two men, two whips, and two naked females
        fixed into adjacent frames, stretched taut like canvasses awaiting the
        brush strokes of a painter. Except that the colour of the stripes came
        not from a painter&#146;s brush but from beneath their own skin. 
      Madame Cavallo reassured her guests that these two women really deserved
        their upcoming punishment, but felt no obligation to go into details. 
      Each naked woman had separate ropes around each wrist and ankle, connecting
        their limbs to the four corners of an upright frame, like a wide doorway.
        The crank and pulley system built into the frame clicked and clacked
        as a handler turned the cog. The women&#146;s feet gradually lost contact
        with the ground as their wrists were pulled to the top corners of the
        frames. Then, as the heavy ropes pulled tighter still, their ankles were
        drawn towards the bottom corners until all slack had been removed, leaving
        the women tethered in mid-air like sails on a mast. Pain was etched on
        their faces as they struggled for breath. 
      After a brief pause, allowing the human canvasses to catch their breath,
        the cranks were turned one further notch. Gasps came from the women,
        and several from the grandstand too, fearing that their limbs might dislocate
        at any moment. 
      The rules of the striping competition were simple. Taking alternate
        turns the two men would lash the whip against their chosen targets trying
        to make distinct horizontal welts at approximately two-inch intervals.
        Drawing blood was permitted but not encouraged; that was better left
        for the flaying contest that evening, where those with a penchant for
        blood and suffering properly indulged their passion. 
       The red striping of female flesh commenced. Each lash of the whip garnered
        either polite applause or muttered disappointment from the grandstand,
        depending equally on the sound of the whip crack, the mark it made and
        the women&#146;s screams. When they were evenly striped from shoulder
        to ankles the frames were turned around so that they faced the grandstand,
        although by that stage the women knew and cared little about the change
        of orientation. 
      The whipmasters grabbed a bottle of water each and shared a private
        joke as they oiled their whips during the five-minute half-time interval.
        They resumed their positions, and without prompting the spectators quietened
        for the second half. This time their whips worked upwards from shins
        to breasts. 
      After the third lash against the thighs, the whipmasters turned to the
        grandstand, as if waiting for permission for their next very special
        stroke. It was granted. In tandem they lowered their whips and lashed
        upward between the splayed legs of their victims. Their cries of agony
        came in tandom also, but were largely drowned by applause.  
      The men continued to stripe the women, at the hips, belly, rib cage,
        and finally their breasts. One of the whipmasters caught both his woman&#146;s
        nipples with a single blow. She seemed to jerk; then hung her head, the
        pain too much for consciousness to endure. The whipmasters received the
        applause and took their bows. Judging would commence in half an hour,
        when the flushing of the slavegirls&#146; skin had receded enough to
        accentuate the full glory of their striping. 
      Cavallo had just the thing to entertain her guests in the meantime -
        a ponygirl parade. 
      Jessica had kept her eyes shut throughout the whipping and wished she
        could have blocked her ears too, but the sight and sound of ponygirls
        renewed her attention to proceedings. 
      The first pair to make a circuit were nothing special, though the sleigh
        bells on their boots made a harmonious rhythm reminiscent of the ponygirls
        on Rabbit Island. 
      The next pair were better drilled, stepping with a precision that even
        a casual spectator could appreciate. The driver was Riccardo, but he
        didn&#146;t even glance in the direction of his former ponygirl and the
        slavegirl that he had frequently dallied with. Jessica and Kate could
        only stare, though Jessica reminded herself that Riccardo was always
        incredibly focussed during pony displays. 
      Receiving polite applause from the grandstand - these people were here
        for much stronger action - Riccardo parked his ponygirls on the outer
        edge of the lawn. 
      Next to appear was Madame Cavallo&#146;s pride and joy. A ponygirl threesome,
        so incredibly lithe and graceful; slim and yet powerful too. An uninitiated
        observer mightn&#146;t notice immediately that their slimness and the
        snug fit of their leatherbodies was due to their being upper-amputees.
        Jessica admired their precise paces, admitting to herself that she would
        never be as good as them, yet failing to acknowledge how bizarre it was
        that she wanted to attain such a skill, and at such a price. 
      It didn&#146;t matter anyway. Jessica was only trying to take her mind
        off the stage equipment on the far side of the lawn. A French guillotine
        and a hanging noose loomed large and threatening over all the previous
        events. Jessica&#146;s mind was in turmoil, her vision a blur, as she
        tried to concentrate on the intricate stepping of the armless ponygirls.
        Not even Kate rocking anxiously beside her could attract her attention.
        She yearned to stand up and shout that she was willing to go through
        with the operation after all, better to lose your arms than your head,
        she told herself! 
      The armless ponygirls trotted to the edge of the lawn, joining their
        inferiors, turning to face the scene of the execution. Even before they
        had settled into their position a booming bass drum sounded, slow and
        portentous. 
      A group of masked men took Jessica and Kate to the scaffold. One man
        on each arm proved not enough as Jessica violently twisted herself from
        their grasp. Another man came to assist, pushing Jessica from behind
        and forcing her up the stage. Kate followed with equal unwillingness.
        The bass drum continued to bang so slowly it could scarcely be called
        a beat. 
      They forced Jessica to her knees, pushing her head between the two wooden
        retaining sections. A brutal hand pushed her neck down into the semi-circular
        cut out. The upper piece dropped with such weight that for a ghastly
        moment it felt like the guillotine blade itself. With her neck trapped
        between two-inch thick wooden planks and her body strapped into a harness
        all Jessica could do was wait, unable to comprehend that this horror
        was really happening. 
      Just two yards away Kate was being prepared, fitted with a double dildo
        harness. Two cameramen were capturing every detail of her struggle, focusing
        on a close-up of Kate&#146;s pussy as the monstrous phallus was forced
        into her. The handlers strapped it neatly beneath her dress, tidying
        the white skirt so that she was presentable for the cameras. Then she
        was noosed, and forced to stand on her tiptoes on a small block of wood.
        The soles of her high heels struggled to find a grip as the coarse rope
        noose was pulled tight, choking her even before it took her weight. 
      One of the cameras left Kate&#146;s trembling body to follow the noose
        upwards, detailing her exquisitely awful predicament. The rope was threaded
        through a series of pulleys and towards the guillotine, finally tied
        onto the lever which would release the guillotine&#146;s blade.  
      When Kate toppled from her precarious perch, as she surely would once
        her vibrating dildos were switched on, the last thing she would see was
        the blade slicing through Jessica&#146;s neck.  
      Madame Cavallo was delighted by her idea, and the way it demonstrated
        that the actions of one slave can have a terrible effect on others. It
        was no coincidence that so many slavegirls and ponygirls were present
        to witness this ultimate punishment. It was something they would never
        forget. 
      The bass drum ceased. The drummer removed the shoulder straps and rested
        it on the ground with its heavy beaters. He then picked up the snare
        drum, looping the strap around his neck, took a drumstick in each hand
        and waited for a signal. It came from the video director once he was
        sure his three cameramen were positioned and taping.  
      The rasping drumroll started. Many in the grandstand shuffled in their
        seats in anticipation at this rare spectacle, whilst groans of horror
        came from the slaves. 
      The executioner approached Kate from behind, brutishly grabbing her
        breasts through the fabric of her dress; kissing her, even biting her
        on the neck. Then he reached between her buttocks and switched on the
        vibrators. 
      Kate gasped, eyes wide open in terror as she tried to breathe. The executioner
        left the stage, leaving just her and Jessica. The latter&#146;s fate
        was utterly in her hands, the ultimate test of her endurance and self-control.
        The vibrations inside her were insistent, irritating and unsettling.
        Did they really think she might be turned on by such treatment? An orgasm
        in death? 
      She adjusted her feet on their narrow perch, almost slipping. Just as
        she regained her composure somebody pushed her from behind, her flailing
        feet lost contact with the platform. It felt like her ribs were cracking. 
      The tug of the noose lessened rather than increased. Kate became aware
        of commotion all around her. People were rushing towards the stage.  
      A gunshot sounded, followed by a loud scream of pain. Kate immediately
        sensed it wasn&#146;t Jessica. Then the executioner ran in front of her
        holding half of his mutilated and blood-spurting hand in front of him. 
      &#147;It&#146;s me Kate,&#148; a voice in her ear said, &#147;stop struggling
        or I might drop you!&#148; 
      Riccardo continued to hold Kate&#146;s panicking body against his knowing
        she would be hanging if he let go. And needing both hands to hold her,
        he couldn&#146;t remove the noose. 
      Kate looked down in amazement as a fist fight erupted immediately below
        her in front of the stage. A man she&#146;d never seen before, a giant
        of a man, flattened two of the execution gang with successive swings
        of his formidable fists. She could have sworn he winked at her.  
      She recognised the next man as he leapt athletically onto the three-foot
        high stage. It was Vince. It took a moment for Kate to register the significance.
        Why was Vince on La Plata? 
      With genuine urgency Vince lifted the top slat from Jessica&#146;s neck
        and helped her unsteadily to her feet. 
      Jessica saw Kate wide-eyed in panic, knowing that a noose around the
        neck and feet not touching the ground wasn&#146;t good. 
      Vince loosened and lifted the noose from Kate&#146;s neck. Riccardo&#146;s
        relief was audible as he&#146;d been holding Kate in mid-air for more
        than a minute. He turned her to face him and hugged her again. 
      &#147;Excuse me. Your man just shot one of my men!&#148; Cavallo shouted
        out to a middle-aged man standing imperiously amid the chaos that had
        descended on her carefully choreographed video movie. 
      &#147;He&#146;ll live!&#148; Master Alex said pointedly. 
      Cavallo was indignant. &#147;You weren&#146;t invited to this event.
        This is for specially invited guests only. You&#146;ve ruined my movie!&#148; Her
        black-clad sidekick on her right shook her fist at him. 
      Alex merely smiled. &#147;I&#146;ve come to collect my slaves. My need
        of them is clearly greater than yours.&#148; 
      Whilst Alex and Madame Cavallo conducted their conversation in front
        of the disarrayed grandstand his four bewildered slaves were hustled
        down to the dock area. The specially invited guests were dispersing -
        a gala supper awaited them.  
      They also had inspections to do: The striped women were still stretched
        out in the frames, the girl on the bitch-frame, the crucified woman and
        all the ponygirls. The gallows and guillotine demanded inspecting too.
        Some guests were muttering that the dramatic conclusion to the afternoon&#146;s
        event had been staged and there never was to be a real execution. 
      Alex climbed the few steps into the grandstand up to Cavallo&#146;s
        level. 
      &#147;Have you seen what they did to me?&#148; Cavallo sniffed, glancing
        at each shoulder. Alex offered his genuine condolences, promising to
        punish the offenders severely when they returned to Rabbit Island. As
        he listed a series of imaginative and bizarre punishments that Kate and
        Jessica would be made to suffer Cavallo&#146;s mood lightened considerably.  
      The damage done, her festivities all-but-ruined, she nonetheless invited
        him to stay for supper. Alex accepted. It would have been rude to refuse.
        Besides, he had known her since she was ten years old, back in the days
        when her father ruled La Plata (and her) with an iron fist. 
      Another man was also invited to dine at Cavallo&#146;s table. A distinguished
        grey-haired man in his sixties, he was the owner of the largest yacht
        in the harbour, the one on which Alex and Vince had sneaked a ride. Ranulph
        Markham cared little for Madame Cavallo, receiving the invite to her
        deathly festivities because of his connections and influence in their
        slave society, certainly not because of any friendship between them. 
      &#147;Have you met my Siamese twins before?&#148; Cavallo asked, nodding
        at the small lycra-clad women flanking her. The one to her right waved
        cutely with her right hand, the one on her left with her left hand. &#147;You
        could say we&#146;ve become quite attached this last few days. They are
        my new arms.&#148; 
      She didn&#146;t show them exactly how attached they were - this was
        a practical arrangement not a sexual one. The thick belt drawn tight
        around Cavallo&#146;s narrow waist was their securing point. A single
        set of handcuffs attached to the back of the belt held one wrist of each
        twin. Having been waited on and pampered all her life Cavallo was adapting
        quickly to her new life. 
      The other female making up the dining foursome (the twins didn&#146;t
        count) was Lucinda. Alex exchanged an awkward greeting with the bronze-necked
        beauty. She wasn&#146;t at all what he expected, which isn&#146;t to
        say he was disappointed.  
      During supper Alex admired how well the twins were managing to feed
        their mistress, even managing a knife and fork between them. Cavallo
        accepted their mistakes and fumblings graciously. She was as gracious
        in public as she was cruel in private. 
      If Alex and Ranulph Markham could hardly bear to look at Cavallo, they
        couldn&#146;t take their eyes off Lucinda - that beautiful face atop
        her impossibly long bronze-encased neck. Cavallo readily extolled Lucinda&#146;s
        praises, explaining how her kindness and loyalty had helped at such a
        terrible time.  
      Alex needed no further convincing as to Lucinda&#146;s qualities. He
        and Lucinda exchanged many fleeting glances during dinner each one accompanied
        by a knowing smile. Seldom had Alex been so immediately taken with somebody.
        It wasn&#146;t just with her unique beauty, but her coolness and bravery
        too. She had telephoned him almost daily during the last few weeks, keeping
        him informed of unfolding events and nervously relaying Riccardo&#146;s
        messages. La Plata&#146;s only telephone was in Cavallo&#146;s private
        quarters, so she had been taking considerable and repeated risks. She
        also influenced Cavallo&#146;s thinking that Riccardo, having promised
        to stop interfering with La Plata&#146;s affairs, should be allowed to
        resume his innocuous job of pony trainer. 
      &#147;I can see that Lucinda is very special. How much will you sell
        her for?&#148; Markham enquired.  
      Far from being rude, in these circles it was good manners to enquire
        about the value of another&#146;s slaves, and there was a certain pleasure
        in having such a conversation in that very slave&#146;s presence. Having
        been a slave all her life, and sold once before, Lucinda was more curious
        than embarrassed as she waited for Cavallo&#146;s considered answer. 
      &#147;When I sell her it will be for half a million dollars,&#148; Cavallo
        answered. Markham nodded. It was about what he expected. Lucinda had
        no idea what such an amount of money meant. For all she knew a cup of
        coffee might have cost a thousand dollars. 
      &#147;Interested, Alex?&#148; Markham asked. 
      He raised his eyebrows. &#147;Very! She&#146;s beautiful, intelligent,
        charming, loyal and unique. It would be a bargain.&#148; 
      Lucinda smiled coyly and blushed. She had a good life on La Plata but
        found herself wondering what life could be like on Rabbit Island with
        Master Alex and, of course, Riccardo. 
      She had to continue wondering. After an hour and a half Alex and Markham
        took their leave of Madame Cavallo having consumed a bottle of wine each.  
      When Alex kissed Madame Cavallo goodbye her twins wrapped their arms
        around him in lieu of a Cavallo hug. They got that wrong. Their mistress
        never hugged men, not even Alex.  
      Alex and Markham declined the offer of a ponygirl ride to the harbour,
        opting for a satisfying post-prandial fifteen-minute walk instead. 
       
      ON BOARD INSPECTION 
       To say Jessica and Kate were pleased to be leaving La Plata was an
        understatement. Kate&#146;s vibrator was still running as the walked
        down to the harbour. She crumpled to the ground as an orgasm rippled
        painfully through her. She stayed there writhing and panting for several
        minutes before being helped to her feet by Riccardo. He was as eager
        to get away from La Plata as anybody. 
      Riccardo dusted her down. &#147;Feel better now?&#148; he asked rather
        condescendingly. Kate could only nod in the affirmative. She did appreciate
        his hand around her waist as she staggered the rest of the way. 
       The four rescued slaves waiting on the rear deck seating weren&#146;t
        in good humour when Alex stepped aboard Markham&#146;s sleek 150-foot
        yacht an hour after them. Riccardo followed Alex&#146;s instruction not
        to release them until he returned, obeying to the letter in leaving them
        all gagged, dressed and bound. Meanwhile the ship&#146;s captain entertained
        him on the bridge. 
      Jessica was accustomed to spending a day in harness while Kate&#146;s
        nurse&#146;s uniform and tape were the least of her problems compared
        to the dildo still strapped into her. The batteries had long since expired. 
      Rachel, in her dress and silk scarf bondage was suffering nothing more
        than tiredness, thirst and hunger.  
      Karen, in her latex corset, stockings, high heels, ballgag and very
        tight ropework biting into her flesh was faring worse, with pain and
        stress etched on her face. 
      Riccardo made them stand to attention when Master Alex approached. 
      Alex inspected their weary bodies, surprised to find anger instead of
        gratitude in their eyes. His supper date with Cavallo hadn&#146;t helped.
        He addressed them as a major might address his soldiers: &#147;I have
        promised Madame Cavallo that the slaves who carried out those dreadful
        deeds shall be severely punished.&#148; 
      Four heads dropped in collective despair. He continued: &#147;And several
        months ago Madame Cavallo promised to care for my slaves and to ensure
        they were kept safe. So I think we&#146;re even now, don&#146;t you?
        You will be punished in due course, but only when we return to on Rabbit
        Island. Now you&#146;ll be taken to your quarters, unbound and given
        food and rest. It looks like you need it.&#148; 
      Vince led the way through a luxurious cream leather and teak-panelled
        stateroom. Kate, Karen, Rachel and Jessica following eagerly behind with
        two words bouncing around in their brains: Food and rest! 
      As Jessica walked past Alex he grabbed her, pulling her backwards onto
        his chest, holding her body against his. He groped her with deliberate
        crudeness, a finger worming its way between her padlocked labia. He nuzzled
        his nose into the crook of her neck as if savouring her sweaty aroma.
        She smelt the alcohol on his breath as he whispered something in her
        ear. 
      Jessica angrily shrugged herself from his grasp and walked quickly away
        to catch up with her companions. 
      Alex liked Jessica&#146;s face - a lot - but admired even more the view
        of her rear, particularly when, as now, the perfect curve between her
        sturdy thighs, hips and trim waist was accentuated by pony strapping
        and a tight waist band.  
      And now she had a new point of interest: Between her thighs, descending
        from her butt-plug, was the plaited pony tail made from her own hair.
        He preferred Jessica&#146;s luxuriant thick hair to be on her head, but
        felt an erotic tingle when sensing the humiliation she must feel at the
        shaving and relocation of her crowning glory. 
      Jessica&#146;s hands, netted into fists and fixed to the belt in the
        small of her back, were straining for freedom. Perhaps she wanted to
        strike him? He didn&#146;t mind. What was the point of restraining a
        female who didn&#146;t need restraining?  
      Jessica needed control and restraint in so many respects, and Alex,
        seeing her for the first time in several months, suddenly remember how
        much he enjoyed giving her what she needed. 
       
      REST, RECUPERATION &amp; REGRETS 
      The scarves knotted around Rachel&#146;s wrists and elbows had become
        so tight that nothing short of a sharp knife could release her. Vince
        also cut through the tape of Kate&#146;s bondage. Then he closed the
        door on the small bedroom leaving Rachel and Kate to release Jessica
        and Karen. It couldn&#146;t come soon enough. 
      The bedroom, on the lowest of the ship&#146;s three floors, contained
        two pairs of man-sized bunk beds. The accommodation consisted of a built-in
        dressing table, drawers and a wardrobe, and an en-suite shower room.
        They each showered hastily, not wanting to deprive others of that pleasure
        for a moment longer than necessary. 
      The door knocked, a key turned, and a man entered the room carrying
        a tray of food: a platter of sandwiches, other snacks and a selection
        of drinks. 
      Kate&#146;s eyes studied the slim young man in his smart maroon uniform
        - clearly one of the ship&#146;s crew. She smiled. &#147;You don&#146;t
        need to knock. We haven&#146;t any clothes to wear, so we&#146;ll be
        naked no matter how much warning you give us.&#148; 
      He retreated from the room with a nervous smile, overwhelmed by sight
        and smell of the four freshly showered naked bodies. The door locked
        behind him. For a few moments they stood and stared unbelieving at the
        feast he had laid before them... then the scramble started. 
      Kate noticed something else on the tray and squealed with delight &#147;Oh
        my god! Champagne!&#148; 
      The bottle had already been uncorked, so Kate quickly slopped it into
        the plastic glasses. A half bottle didn&#146;t go far between four but
        nobody was complaining. They settled back on the bunks, eating, drinking,
        talking and laughing loudly until a hand banged several times on the
        door. 
      &#147;Keep it down,&#148; said Vince&#146;s commanding voice. They chuckled
        quietly like schoolgirls. 
      Kate saw that Jessica seemed pensive after their burst of euphoria wore
        off. &#147;What&#146;s up, Jessi?&#148; 
      &#147;Oh! It&#146;s Master Alex. He annoyed me.&#148; 
      &#147;I saw him grab you, the horny devil. I expect he was pleased to
        see his favourite ponygirl again!&#148; teased Kate. 
      &#147;Madame Cavallo was right!&#148; 
      &#147;Don&#146;t be silly, how can she be right about anything?&#148; 
      &#147;While I was strapped to the operating table, she spoke about him.
        She said his method of torture was far worse than anything she could
        devise.&#148; 
      &#147;That sounds unlikely, Jessi.&#148; 
      &#147;She meant mentally and emotionally. That he would screw me up
        badly.&#148; 
      Kate sighed. &#147;Well Jessi, looking at you right now, I think maybe
        she had a point. But would you rather be on La Plata where men are cruel
        and women are crueller? Besides, I really don&#146;t think they&#146;d
        have us back.&#148; 
      &#147;Of course I don&#146;t want to go back. I just wish he wouldn&#146;t
        mess with my mind.&#148; 
      &#147;It&#146;s gone!&#148; interrupted Rachel, who had been staring
        out of the porthole for some time. La Plata&#146;s peaks had disappeared
        from the dark horizon. &#147;I never thought I&#146;d be glad to return
        to Rabbit Island!&#148; 
      &#147;It&#146;s only the lesser of two evils, it&#146;s not paradise,&#148; Karen
        reminded her. &#147;You&#146;ll soon be strung up, whipped and fucked.
        Their chains are like anyone else&#146;s chains!&#148; 
      Rachel might have corrected Karen on that point except she wasn&#146;t
        the arguing type. She knew Rabbit Island&#146;s handcuffs had smooth,
        rounded edges that didn&#146;t cut into her wrists like La Plata&#146;s.
        She fingered the handcuffs which were fixed by a chain to the headboard
        of each bunk. The foot of the bunk had a similar arrangement for the
        ankles. They were the same type as Rabbit Island&#146;s. 
      The precise low frequency throb of the ship&#146;s engines seemed louder
        as the revs increased, and as their conversation petered out with tiredness.
        Each retired, defeated by exhaustion, to her bunk. Kate and Jessica were
        side by side on the lower bunks. Karen, on the top bunk, switched of
        the main light to leave just the faint red glow of emergency lighting.  
      Jessica slipped her hands into the cuffs and quietly ratcheted them
        closed. 
       
      MIDNIGHT VISITOR 
       While the slaves slept in their quarters, the men drank and talked
        in the luxurious stateroom on the floor above them. 
      &#147;When Lucinda told me they planned to do mock executions &#145;a
        la Tosca&#146;,&#148; Riccardo recounted, &#147;that&#146;s when I knew
        it was serious. She said Cavallo had promised it would only be pretend
        executions. I explained that Tosca the opera wasn&#146;t like that. Just
        like in the opera they were only pretending to pretend. Typical of Cavallo&#146;s
        humour!&#148; 
      &#147;So true! When Ranulph received his faxed invitation I knew we&#146;d
        be at the event in perfect time, invited or not!&#148; Alex shook his
        head. &#147;I still can&#146;t believe she was going to do it. In fact,
        not until the very last moment did I believe it!&#148; 
      A silence descended as Riccardo, Vince, Alex, Ranulph Markham and Cormack,
        his handsome giant of a bodyguard, considered the possibility. &#147;But
        we&#146;ve never had our arms amputated by a slave,&#148; Vince reminded
        them. 
      &#147;Nor have we wanted to amputate a slave&#146;s arms,&#148; Alex
        added, &#147;and on that subject, I&#146;m going to check on the slaves
        now.&#148; 
      He&#146;d had his fill of alcohol on La Plata and late in the evening
        he was fully sober, even though the others had continued to drink - Markham,
        Cormack, Vince and particularly Riccardo still drinking in some quantity
        as they mused on the day&#146;s events. 
      Alex opened the door into the slave&#146;s darkened room. The four bodies
        were motionless. 
      He seemed to instinctively know which was Jessica&#146;s bunk, as if
        by smell alone. Bending down to his knees he spoke softly to her, even
        though, or perhaps because, she was sleeping.  
      He wanted to touch her, but didn&#146;t. He sighed and spoke softly
        in her ear. 
      &#147;I meant what I said, Jessica. I really did miss you.&#148;

     Chapter 23. Slave to Fortune 
  (Even Ponygirls Sometimes Get the Blues, by Aurelius) 
 
  The story so far:  
  (Ch. 19) The Breeding Shed 
  (Ch. 20) Escape from the Breeding Shed 
  (Ch. 21) The Operation 
  (Ch. 22) The Guillotine 
   
It was like a nightmare from which there was no escape. Jessica tried to open
  her eyes but couldn&#146;t. Her hands and feet were locked in shackles that
  held her body stretched out on a slab. People were doing something to her nipples,
  tugging on them. Her hips were held down. She sensed they were about to operate. 
&#147;That&#146;s better. Now I&#146;ve got you,&#148; said the female voice
  above her - her captor. &#147;You&#146;re never going to get away from me again!&#148; 
It had to be Madame Cavallo, but somehow the voice didn&#146;t fit. Hands,
  obviously a woman&#146;s, lovingly cupped her breasts and then something rubbed
  against them almost tickling. It felt like rope. 
&#147;Jessi, are you awake?&#148; 
Her mind was playing tricks. The voice sounded like Kate&#146;s. Why then,
  Jessica wondered, is she torturing me? She felt a mild pain in the ribs as
  if someone was digging something into her. 
&#147;Wake up!&#148; The voice demanded through gritted teeth, the probing
  of her ribs became incessant, infuriating, and Jessica could do nothing to
  repel it. If she wasn&#146;t blindfolded and gagged she might have pleaded
  for mercy at that moment. She had to try. 
&#147;Stop!&#148; Jessica said, surprising herself that she was able to speak.
  She opened her eyes and met blinding daylight, not the darkness she expected.
  The gag and blindfold were only in her dream. 
Kate was smiling at her. &#147;Good morning Jessi. Did you sleep well?&#148; 
Jessica gradually gained consciousness. &#147;I thought I was being operated
  on.&#148; 
&#147;No more operations for you. We&#146;re safe now. Remember?&#148; 
Jessica looked around the room and suddenly remembered: The ship! Sitting
  astride her hips was Kate, her face lit up with joy. 
&#147;What are you doing?&#148; Jessica asked. 
&#147;I&#146;ve been waiting for you to wake up.&#148; 
Jessica chuckled. &#147;This is what you call waiting? And this rope?&#148; She
  was referring to the length of rope running through her nipple rings and tied
  off at each end to one of Kate&#146;s wrists.  
&#147;There was nothing else to play with,&#148; Kate explained. Perfectly
  rational behavior, she thought. 
&#147;Damn it Katie, you&#146;ve cuffed my ankles too!&#148; 
&#147;Sorry Jessi, I was bored. I saw your feet poking out from the sheet
  and the ankle cuffs lying next to them. I couldn&#146;t help myself, but I
  fixed them loosely so it won&#146;t hurt your bad ankle. Anyway,&#148; Kate
  added mischievously, &#147;It wasn&#146;t me who cuffed your hands, was it?&#148; 
&#147;Well, I thought it was required, like in the ponygirl quarters. I did
  it before I went to sleep.&#148; 
&#147;Oh Jessi, you&#146;re such a good obedient slave, and sexy too!&#148; Kate
  teased. 
Jessica frowned. &#147;Sexy? Look at me! Hair like an army recruit, the thighs
  of Bulgarian weightlifter, and this metal contraption in my mouth making me
  speak funny!&#148; 
Kate laughed. &#147;I&#146;d give you one if I were a man! I&#146;d ram my
  throbbing cock into your cunt and fuck your brains out!&#148; Kate bounced
  herself on Jessica&#146;s loins as if to demonstrate. &#147;And I&#146;d keep
  you chained to my bed as my personal fuck toy.&#148; 
&#147;Oh, that&#146;s just great,&#148; Jessica sighed, &#147;even my best
  friend wants to make me her sex slave! What hope is there for me?&#148; 
&#147;None whatsoever,&#148; said Kate. She leant forward, almost face-to-face
  with Jessica, and spoke in barely a whisper, &#147;not until we escape!&#148; 
&#147;Katie, you forgot to add &#145;again&#146;.&#148; 
&#147;Until we escape again. Properly. Once and for all!&#148; 
&#147;I suppose you&#146;re going to overpower that Cormack guy and take control
  of the ship.&#148; 
&#147;Perhaps. But I may need to seduce him first,&#148; Kate winked. &#147;You
  know. Get to know him, build up trust.&#148; 
&#147;Size him up. Feel the strength of his muscles. Find out if he&#146;s
  as good a fuck as he looks.&#148; 
Kate feigned a look of shock, but not disgust, at the suggestion. &#147;Why,
  I ought to punish you for saying such a thing, but I&#146;m too damn tired.
  I think I&#146;ll go back to bed.&#148; 
She snuggled into the gap between Jessica&#146;s body and the wall until she&#146;d
  made a comfortable nest for herself. The rope connecting her wrists to Jessica&#146;s
  nipples remained. &#147;Mind if I sleep here for a while?&#148; 
Jessica yawned contentedly. &#147;I don&#146;t have any choice, do I?&#148; 
THE ENVELOPE 
&#147;You seem preoccupied,&#148; Markham observed to his breakfast companion
  as they sipped orange juice. &#147;Something in the envelope they gave you
  yesterday?&#148; 
Alex looked up from the papers he was reading. &#147;No, everything&#146;s
  fine. Do you think I was right to leave one of my slaves with Cavallo as compensation?&#148; 
&#147;It seemed reasonable in the circumstances. It&#146;s hardly compensation,
  for what happened to her, but it was a good gesture. What was her name?&#148; 
&#147;Mandy.&#148; 
&#147;I don&#146;t recollect her.&#148; 
&#147;Nor I. I didn&#146;t know her well.&#148; 
&#147;Don&#146;t worry, Alex. I&#146;m sure she&#146;ll be fine on La Plata.
  I think we&#146;ll see a kinder, gentler Argenta Cavallo from now on.&#148; 
&#147;No jokes about being armless please Ranulph. I&#146;m still concerned
  about Janie, one of her previous victims, and what the hell we going to do
  with her on Rabbit Island.&#148; 
&#147;The same thing you do to all the others, old boy,&#148; Markham said
  with his throaty chortle. &#147;You worry too much lately. Try not to get emotionally
  involved. I&#146;ve said it before; you should get yourself a companion slave
  like my Linsey. Then you&#146;ll have an outlet for these kind of feelings.&#148; 
&#147;A companion slave?&#148; Alex shook his head, &#147;It&#146;s not practical.
  I travel too much, and I&#146;m not as wealthy as you are.&#148; 
&#147;What else is in the envelope?&#148; Markham enquired, trying to read
  the upside-down printing in Alex&#146;s hand. 
&#147;As well as the DVD of Kate on the bitch-frame we watched last night,
  there are other photos, some nice ones of the ponygirls. They&#146;ll go up
  on the wall in the ponygirl quarters. The Island&#146;s ponygirls have a strange
  curiosity for their photographs for some reason.&#148; He laid them out on
  the table for Markham to view. &#147;There&#146;s also a couple of padlock
  keys. One is for Jessica&#146;s padlock I assume.&#148; 
&#147;You hope!&#148; Markham winked at him. 
&#147;And medical reports on the four slaves. All are in good health, although
  with her ankle fracture Jessica won&#146;t be resuming her ponygirl work for
  several weeks. It&#146;ll take that long to reactivate the activities of the
  island anyhow.&#148; 
&#147;Looking forward to it Alex?&#148; 
Alex leant back in his chair and smiled. &#147;The new and improved Rabbit
  Island. I can&#146;t wait!&#148; 
SLAVE TO FORTUNE 
What better way to keep everything ship-shape than to have four beautiful
  naked women scrubbing the decks? Markham&#146;s ship, &#145;Slave to Fortune&#146; was
  gleaming. 
In truth, it was no more arduous than any housework. Nearby Riccardo and Alex
  were also busying themselves on the deck as they waited for sunset. 
Kate had renamed Riccardo &#145;The Hosemaster&#146; as he hosed the decks
  while the women scrubbed them. He didn&#146;t seem to mind the name, and even
  Alex had taken to calling him by it. 
Riccardo found a blast of cold water from the high-pressure jet proved as
  effective as a whip in keeping the slaves on the job. It was easier to aim
  and required almost no effort compared with a whip. It was also more fun, he
  discovered, while attempting to give Jessica an enema from six feet away. 
&#147;There are four more things to be cleaned.&#148; Riccardo announced,
  just as they thought everything was done. The slaves groaned, their arms aching,
  unaccustomed to work after their week of immobility. He pointed his finger
  at each of them in turn. &#147;One, two, three, four! You first Jessica.&#148; 
He made Jessica kneel doggie-style in the middle of the deck then slipped
  a choker chain over her head and handed Rachel the leash. Then he rinsed a
  sponge and pushed the whole thing into Jessica&#146;s mouth; to prevent her
  swallowing soapsuds, he explained lamely. From that moment, their previous
  playfulness developed an edge of sexual tension, which Jessica&#146;s body
  language did nothing to dispel as she anticipated her sponge and hose bath. 
Equipped with fresh buckets of warm soapy water the other slaves gave Jessica
  a bath like nothing she had every known. Perhaps it was the sunshine, the luxury
  of the Slave to Fortune, and the informality of Riccardo and Alex that made
  them participate so wholeheartedly in Jessica&#146;s cleansing.  
Riccardo reminded Jessica&#146;s cleaners that they should get into all her
  crevices. Kate had anticipated his command and took up the prime position at
  Jessica&#146;s rear end. She rubbed the sponge vigorously on Jessica&#146;s
  sex as if removing a stubborn stain, pushing provocatively against Jessica
  padlocked labia with each stroke. Jessica&#146;s back legs began to collapse
  in response to the stimulation until she was sitting on Kate&#146;s hand. Riccardo
  intervened with his bare foot rising between her legs, obliging her to lift
  her ass up. 
&#147;She&#146;s never had puppy training,&#148; Kate joked. 
&#147;Unlike you, Kate. I remember that time on Rabbit Island. What a fine
  puppy girl you made. A natural bitch I&#146;d say. Then on La Plata you went
  up to the next level.&#148; 
Kate quickly returned her attention to scrubbing Jessica as if she wasn&#146;t
  listening, but Riccardo wasn&#146;t done: 
&#147;You were equally memorably in the bitch-dog program. We were watching
  the video of you last night. What a spirited performance you gave until you
  changed from resistance to willingness! You certainly have a way with your
  canine admirers.&#148; 
 
Kate sniffed back her tears as she rubbed absent-mindedly on Jessica&#146;s belly,
never expecting Riccardo of all people to remind her of that most humiliating
memory - her dog-induced orgasm on the bitch frame.
 &#147;And all the time I was thinking of you,&#148; she muttered bitterly,
  not intending that anyone should hear. 
&#147;It makes me want to roll my sleeves up and get stuck in myself,&#148; Alex
  joked, lightening the mood again in an instant. The sight of Jessica kneeling
  on all fours and dripping in soapsuds had stirred him more than he expected. 
He walked around her to take in the front view. Jessica&#146;s dark eyes looked
  up at him, not with their usual defiance, but with a mild confusion. She managed
  to mmmph an acknowledgement to him from her sponge-filled mouth. White soapsuds
  flowed sensuously from her hair and face. Alex coughed, and quickly brushed
  his hand against the front of his shorts. 
After a refreshing high-powered rinse by Riccardo the Hosemaster, Jessica
  had her chance to reciprocate, or gain her revenge, on Kate. As an experienced
  bitch Kate managed to hold her doggie position despite determined and provocative
  sponging from Jessica. 
THE SUN LOUNGERS 
The afternoon of cleaning and being cleaned ended. Jessica was happy with
  the instruction that she should rest awhile on a sun lounger. She laid down
  and got comfortable while Riccardo secured a light shackle to her left ankle. 
Alongside her on the other lounger was a woman Jessica had seen briefly earlier
  in the day. She too wore a shackle around her left ankle, a sign perhaps of
  their equal status, Jessica assumed. She was reading, but put down the heavy
  novel and offered her hand for a feminine handshake. &#147;Hello. I&#146;m
  Linsey. Mr. Markham&#146;s companion slave.&#148; 
&#147;I&#146;m Jessica. A Rabbit Island ponygirl.&#148; 
Linsey&#146;s eyebrows lifted, as if impressed. For the first time she was
  meeting a real ponygirl. 
Jessica understood she was English to judge by her accent, and was around
  her own age. Although quite pretty (slim and shapely with long auburn hair)
  it wasn&#146;t Linsey&#146;s natural looks that attracted Jessica&#146;s attention,
  but her body, or rather the designs upon her skin. 
&#147;I like your tattoos,&#148; Jessica said as her eyes roamed the length
  of Linsey&#146;s slim body. 
&#147;Thanks. I&#146;m not finished yet,&#148; Linsey explained. Brilliant,
  colourful designs of birds, butterflies, flowers and fruit caressed her body,
  literally from head to toe, in a continuous ever-changing pattern. Jessica
  was particularly impressed with how the design swirled around one breast leaving
  the other unmarked as it swirled under her arm and reappeared over her shoulder,
  up her neck, culminating in a delicate red rose on her cheek. 
&#147;All I have is a little rabbit and my slave number at the top of my thigh,&#148; Jessica
  said, almost apologetically, then she remembered: &#147;Oh, and a brand on
  my buttock also.&#148; 
&#147;Rabbit Island, huh? When Mr. Markham first captured me, he said I&#146;d
  be shipped there if I didn&#146;t respond to slave training.&#148; 
Jessica felt defensive. &#147;It&#146;s not so bad. There are much worse places.
  It wasn&#146;t the Rabbit Island guys who did this to me,&#148; she pointed
  a finger at her cropped hair, then opened her mouth to show off her T-bar. 
&#147;I&#146;m glad you&#146;re happy there,&#148; said Linsey. &#147;Luckily
  I passed the training, and a year later Mr. Markham decided to make me his
  companion slave. Now I travel everywhere with him.&#148; 
Jessica was confused. &#147;You&#146;re a slave, right?&#148; 
&#147;Well yes, but I&#146;m his slave and his companion. I
  want only to be with him, to serve him, and to make him happy.&#148; 
Jessica looked at Linsey sympathetically. &#147;I think you&#146;ve been brainwashed.&#148; 
&#147;So they say. They used hypnotism, drug therapies, behavior modifications,
  torture and god knows what else. What they didn&#146;t expect was that I would
  fall in love with Mr. Markham anyhow.&#148; 
Jessica wasn&#146;t convinced. Perhaps Linsey was right, but more likely the
  brainwashing was so successful that she couldn&#146;t even accept it as the
  reason she loved Markham. 
&#147;Do you want to stay a ponygirl?&#148; Linsey asked. 
&#147;I&#146;ll be released in a year,&#148; Jessica said confidently. &#147;Then
  I won&#146;t be a slave any more. Master Alex promised me, and I believe him.&#148; 
&#147;So you don&#146;t want to be somebody&#146;s companion slave?&#148; 
&#147;No.&#148; Jessica said curtly. 
&#147;I can&#146;t imagine you as a free woman. You have the soul of a slave.
  I can see it in you.&#148; 
Jessica was bristling. &#147;Is that supposed to be a compliment?&#148; 
&#147;It&#146;s more than a compliment, Jessica. Some women can only find
  true contentment through being owned by one man, and by a man who knows what
  you need sexually. Most women settle for marriage where a woman feels she belongs
  to somebody, but with companion slaves the belonging is absolute. I always
  wear his chains and I&#146;m forever marked as his property. I&#146;ve never
  been happier.&#148; 
Jessica sighed. &#147;I&#146;ll take your word for it, but for me it&#146;s
  another year of ponygirl life then I&#146;m going back to New York: The real
  world, family, a job, friends. Before I go they&#146;ll put me through a memory
  cleaning process that will erase this whole experience from my mind.&#148; 
It was Linsey&#146;s turn to look sympathetically at her companion. 
EVENING ENTERTAINMENT 
Jessica loved the Slave to Fortune and begun to feel more like a privileged
  passenger than a slave. Perhaps Cavallo&#146;s Silver Lady was as luxurious
  but on that ship she only traveled &#145;steerage&#146;, bound securely to
  a bunk in the bowels of the ship for the whole journey. 
Now she was in the main lounge, an area fitted with expansive cream leather
  seating and teak woodwork. She returned a smile with Rachel and Karen sitting
  on the floor across from her; scarcely able to believe her change of circumstance
  merely a day after her neck was on the guillotine. 
She looked at the bright silver manacles around her wrists, as finely engineered
  as the ship itself. They matched the collar she wore. The wrist manacles were
  joined only by a long chain that threaded through a loop in the front of her
  collar, passing through each of her nipple rings on the way to her respective
  wrists. With her arm movement virtually unrestricted, it didn&#146;t feel like
  bondage, more as if she had become somebody&#146;s erotic toy. 
Opposite, Rachel seemed equally content. She wore a belly chain, her hands
  cuffs to each hip like prisoner chains, except these were infinitely finer.
  Alongside her was Karen, with her hands were joined together in the same kind
  of manacles, fixed to her collar by a short chain that held her hands just
  below her breasts in an attitude of prayer. 
The evening unfolded as a casual affair with men coming and going, sometimes
  sitting in the lounge, sometimes moving to the outside deck for more intense
  or private conversations. Ranulph Markham seemed more interested in cooking,
  and was often heard in the galley joking with his chef. Not a sound came from
  Jessica. She had been lectured beforehand that the slightest noise would be
  rewarded with a ballgag. The thought of ruining her current presentation with
  something so vulgar was a serious threat. She squirmed in private embarrassment
  recollecting the evening she was ballgagged at Master Alex&#146;s side, when
  she dribbled all over his thigh. 
Just as Jessica wondered what happened to Linsey and Kate, the former appeared,
  accompanied by Cormack and a large coil of white rope. Meeting no physical
  or verbal resistance, Cormack fixed Linsey into a kneeling ball-tie, her breasts
  squashed into her thighs by the tight ropes that encircled her. She had submitted
  willingly, which is not to say she was happy about it.  
Supper was called, and Jessica&#146;s rumbling stomach hoped she would sample
  what was brought from the kitchen. However there was one thing that she wanted
  even more than food, and she hated herself for it. 
He acted so casual, joking lightly with Markham about how he&#146;d been slaving
  away in the galley to prepare supper. Why was her heart pounding as Alex continued
  to joke even after filling his plate from the buffet table? He hadn't even
  glanced at her, apparently finding the sight of Linsey&#146;s tattooed and
  thoroughly trussed body much more interesting. 
Then he sat down next to her as if the seating arrangement was never in doubt.
  Jessica inwardly sighed with relief. Ashamed and embarrassed by her short hair
  and tongue bar she considered Alex&#146;s action a welcome boost to her self-worth. 
She turned her head to flash him a smile which proved not a tight-lipped as
  she had planned. Linsey&#146;s talk of belonging to someone began to make sense.
  Perhaps, Jessica thought fleetingly, she really did want to belong to someone. 
&#147;You&#146;ll need one of these,&#148; said Markham, offering Alex an
  object similar to a graduate&#146;s mortarboard. Markham addressed Jessica
  for the first time. &#147;Sit on your bum, girl, ankles to the side, back straight,
  face forward.&#148; 
She felt herself flush with embarrassment at having to be informed of this
  slave&#146;s etiquette, by such an important man, although Markham&#146;s tone
  wasn&#146;t unkind. He placed the foam mortarboard on Jessica&#146;s head.
  The bottom of it was moulded to fit snugly over her skull. Above her Jessica
  heard the chink of cutlery on china as Alex put his plate on her head. 
Jessica&#146;s mortifying recollection of the dribbling ballgag episode could
  pale into insignificance compared to spilling the plate&#146;s contents into
  Alex&#146;s lap, or worse still, onto Markham&#146;s furniture. She noticed
  that Rachel and Karen had been similarly equipped, their faces mirroring the
  trepidation she felt. 
Markham had opted for a slightly more traditional table - Linsey&#146;s back.
  The plate rested neatly onto her ropes whilst her bound hands held his wineglass
  as if she had done it a hundred times. 
The topic of conversation was food, specifically Thai cuisine, leaving Jessica
  to concentrate on sitting upright and not embarrassing herself or Master Alex.
  While he ate, Jessica stayed motionless, a human table. 
Later, Alex lifted the plate and started feeding Jessica with his leftover
  morsels. 
&#147;You don&#146;t need to feed her, they can lick the plates from the floor,&#148; Markham
  suggested. 
&#147;It&#146;s okay, she can&#146;t lick with the T-bar in her mouth. Besides,
  I enjoy feeding her,&#148; said Alex. It was something Jessica had never heard
  him say before. She felt his fingers in her mouth and sucked on them. Her eyes
  closed as she tasted his fingers as well as the tasty oriental food. He put
  a piece of chicken in the palm of his hand and felt Jessica&#146;s lips remain
  longer than necessary as she took it. If Alex said he enjoyed feeding her then
  Jessica ensured he wasn&#146;t disappointed. 
Markham put his plate on the floor for Linsey to lick clean as if she were
  a pet dog. &#147;You know, not much human furniture is really practical, but
  these snack tables work very well.&#148; 
&#147;I agree on both counts. Ever tried a body bed?&#148; Alex asked him. 
&#147;Heard of it but never seen a real one.&#148; 
&#147;I tried one at Rishiki&#146;s estate near Hironaki. He lays six women
  across the base of a bed, alternating their direction. There are wooden cutouts
  for ankles and another that goes above the breasts,&#148; Alex explained. He
  placed a karate-chop hand on top of Jessica&#146;s breasts to illustrate. &#147;The
  sides of the bed are boxed in, so you don&#146;t see any heads, arms and feet.&#148; 
Markham seemed skeptical. &#147;It&#146;s a great way of showing off but is
  it comfortable? I imagine it must be rather bony.&#148; 
Alex raised a finger. &#147;Ah, but that&#146;s the clever part. Rishiki selects
  them for body shape and keeps them fattened so there&#146;s a nice layer of
  flesh on their ribs and hips. Their bodies are covered in a light sheet but
  you can still feel their breasts lining at the sides of the bed, and if you
  dig down with your fingers you can feel their little cunts beneath. It really
  was a soft bed, and very warm too. The rise and fall from their breathing was
  very relaxing.&#148;  
&#147;Hmmm. Perhaps I&#146;ll fatten up some slaves and give it a try,&#148; said
  Markham, his interested piqued by Alex&#146;s description. &#147;I can&#146;t
  remember. Have you seen my door-belle?&#148; 
Alex shook his head. 
&#147;You really should come to England more often! I have a woman kneeling
  at the front door all strapped up in black leather, including a harness ballgag.
  She has large bells hanging from her nipples and a small vibrator up her anus
  wired to the doorbell. When you press the front door buzzer, she receives a
  shock that makes her to wiggle her breasts causing the bells to make a delightful
  jangling sound. That&#146;s what summons the butler to the door. Most visitors
  are so amused they demand a further demonstration from the girl.&#148; 
Alex laughed. &#147;Sounds great! What a shame we don&#146;t need a doorbell
  on a ship or I&#146;d volunteer Jessica here for the job.&#148; 
Jessica was almost amused. It sounded a lot less effort than being a ponygirl. 
The plates were cleared from the room and Linsey was partially untied, leaving
  only her hands and feet bound. Markham patted the space to his left inviting
  Linsey to join him on the plush seating. She managed to wriggle her way onto
  it, snuggling up to him with an expression of joy on her face. Markham kissed
  her with genuine affection. 
Jessica had drawn her own conclusion about Riccardo&#146;s and Kate&#146;s
  non-appearance. Knowing of their mutual attraction it seemed obvious they would
  spend private time together at the earliest opportunity. She was happy for
  them. 
Then she heard a sound, actually a shout, which was the last thing she expected
  to hear on a ship in the middle of the ocean. 
&#147;Hyah!&#148; 
It was Riccardo&#146;s pony-driving shout. 
Master Alex clamped his hand over Jessica&#146;s mouth just as the door opened.
  A ponygirl entered, with erratic, ill-disciplined high stepping into the middle
  of the room followed by Riccardo holding her reins and shouting encouragements
  to her. 
All the men in the room laughed uncontrollably. Jessica would have too had
  Alex not kept his hand over her mouth. Kate continued her artless high stepping
  as Riccardo tapped her with his whip. Jessica doubted she ever looks as red
  and flustered as Kate at that moment, even after a ten mile run. 
&#147;I&#146;ve just been breaking in my new ponygirl,&#148; Riccardo announced. &#147;What
  do you think?&#148; 
Alex laughed. &#147;I think you have your work cut out. She&#146;s too small
  and far too rebellious for a ponygirl. And look how she&#146;s sweating up
  already!&#148; 
&#147;Well I had some difficulty getting her into the harness. She became very excitable.&#148; He
  grabbed Kate from behind, embracing her. &#147;Easy girl!&#148; 
Kate tried to stand still but could barely manage without Riccardo&#146;s
  help. Wearing Jessica&#146;s high arched pony-boots was like balancing on stilts,
  and she was never good in heels. Having ginger extract smeared on her butt-tail
  before insertion wasn&#146;t helping her composure either, although it gave
  her the highly agitated effect Riccardo was looking for. 
Alex removed his hand from Jessica&#146;s mouth after reminding her not to
  speak. She smiled broadly at Kate then Master Alex, enjoying Kate&#146;s unlikely
  pony transformation as much as anybody. 
&#147;You need to give her something to help her calm down,&#148; Markham
  said, &#147;and we all know what&#146;s best for calming a woman&#146;s nerves.&#148; He
  turned to Cormack, &#147;do we have a strap-on dildo on board?&#148; 
While Cormack briefly disappeared to retrieve a suitable item, Riccardo made
  Kate kneel facing the leather bench seat. He pushed her perspiring torso against
  its surface and spread her knees. That position did little to calm her, knowing
  what was about to happen to her. 
Cormack returned, walking straight over to Jessica. He knew from the outset
  what the plan was. He released the chain holding Jessica&#146;s collar to a
  retaining ring on the seat front and helped her to her feet. Jessica looked
  anxiously at Alex. He returned a reassuring smile. 
Cormack had a sure touch with women and strapped the dildo around Jessica&#146;s
  loins without meeting the slightest resistance. He made her kneel down behind
  Kate, her knees on the floor between Kate&#146;s. 
Kate couldn&#146;t keep still as the ginger inflamed and irritated her rectum.
  Sensing that her best friend was about to give a public fucking wasn&#146;t
  helping her composure either. 
&#147;Shall I push it in for you?&#148; Cormack suggested to Jessica as she
  looked warily at the phallus bobbing waywardly from her crotch. With his guidance
  Jessica pushed forward until it eased smoothly inside Kate. Unused to having
  a pony&#146;s bit between her teeth Kate gasped and gargled to enliven the
  scene even further. 
Seeing Kate squirming beneath her, obviously in a state of some arousal Jessica
  jogged her hips forward. Kate grunted, biting hard into the bridle bit. Jessica
  pushed again, her hands holding onto Kate&#146;s netted fist-shaped hands locked
  in the middle of her back. 
Alex and everyone else had disappeared; at least that was how Jessica felt
  as they stood up and refreshed their glasses behind her.  
If Kate&#146;s cries and grunts seemed almost painful, it didn&#146;t dissuade
  Jessica from her task. She knew how robust Kate was, particularly during sexual
  intercourse. To withdraw without bringing an orgasm was as likely to incur
  Kate&#146;s wrath as it was the displeasure of her masters. For her part, each
  thrust put pressure on the padlock that joined her labia together reminding
  Jessica of her own physical needs. 
As Kate&#146;s inevitable orgasm arrived with a gargling, squealing voice
  of accompaniment Jessica couldn&#146;t help but whisper friendly teasing endearments
  in her ear. Jessica had spent almost a year as a ponygirl and never been fucked
  in harness (which isn&#146;t to say she&#146;d never had an orgasm), but for
  Kate it had taken less than an hour. So typical of Kate&#146;s luck, Jessica
  thought. 
&#147;She&#146;s broken the silence rule,&#148; Markham noted to Alex after
  catching Jessica&#146;s endearments to Kate. &#147;What kind of gag would you
  like to put on her?&#148; 
Alex thought it rather harsh, but rules were rules, and he was happy to play
  the game. He had another idea: &#147;First I&#146;d like to take her onto the
  deck for punishment, a long overdue punishment.&#148; 
He helped Jessica to her feet and led her, surly and silent, onto the lower
  rear deck.  
JESSICA IN SUSPENSE 
&#147;Wait here!&#148; Alex said, leaving Jessica alone with the moonlit ocean
  waves gliding past. She waited, looking out to sea, an empty sea with nothing
  but a dark horizon to orient her. The ship felt like an island, a world of
  its own floating in space. Her chained hands were able to reach down to her
  artificial erection, still wet from Kate&#146;s juices. She lifted a wetted
  hand to her face and sniffed. 
A noise, a loud &#145;clomp&#146; of something dropping to the floor startled
  her. It was Alex and an alarming quantity of neat hanks of rope. 
&#147;Turn around,&#148; he instructed, making her face away from him. He
  unfastened the buckle of the strap between her legs, and the one at the back
  of her waist. She smiled coyly as he cast it aside to restore her nakedness. 
&#147;I like seeing your hands chained like that. It&#146;s elegant.&#148; Alex
  said. 
He took hold of her hands pulling them towards him, causing their collar chains
  to rattle through her nipple rings. She didn&#146;t even flinch. He unlocked
  her bracelets, also pulling free the chain threaded through to her collar.
  He placed them carefully in a blue felt bag. The collar followed. 
&#147;They look expensive&#148; Jessica commented, the first words she had
  spoken to him in many months. 
&#147;Not too expensive. Around two thousand dollars, which isn&#146;t much
  compared to the price of a good female slave.&#148; 
Jessica stood naked and free except for a labial padlock in front of the man
  who controlled her destiny and dominated her thoughts. She didn&#146;t know
  whether to punch him, kick him, jump overboard, or kneel at his feet and beg
  him to end her torment. His open arms helped her make the decision, she walked
  into his embrace and pressed her face against his shirt, feeling neither love
  nor hate, nor anger or joy. They stood like that for a few moments. It wasn&#146;t
  the passionate embrace of reunited lovers, nor even of close friends, merely
  two individuals with something peculiar in common. 
&#147;What are you going to do to me?&#148; Jessica asked. 
&#147;Right now I&#146;m going to tie you up, but you probably guessed that
  already. We can talk while I do it.&#148; 
Jessica was more relieved than worried when she felt her wrists drawn together
  in the middle of her back. How strange that the final tug of knots around her
  wrists could settle her mind like it did! Choices could be a terrible and dangerous
  thing for a slave. Without choices she could relax. Tonight she was Master
  Alex&#146;s slave again. It was that simple. 
He unwound another hank of rope. &#147;I&#146;ve been to Japan recently and
  studied shibari, the art of rope bondage. Now seems like a good time to practice.&#148; 
&#147;I&#146;ve always wanted to go to Japan.&#148; Jessica commented wistfully. 
&#147;Perhaps you will one day.&#148; 
&#147;If you sell me?&#148; 
Alex tugged hard on the rope he&#146;d just wrapped around her breasts. &#147;You
  know I&#146;m not going to sell you! Next year you&#146;ll go through the memory
  reversal program and if that works out you&#146;ll go home. Nothing has changed.&#148; 
Jessica sensed his mild irritation. An enslaver and abuser of women, and yet
  apparently a man of his word too. 
&#147;I&#146;m sorry Sir. I was confused. What will happen when we return
  to Rabbit Island?&#148; 
&#147;You&#146;ll be a ponygirl again, probably for the rest of your time.
  No complications, no surprises, no being lent to other islands. Back with your
  friends enjoying all the island has to offer.&#148; 
She laughed at his irony, just as he intended. &#147;And will there still
  be whips, Master Alex?&#148; 
&#147;For as long as necessary,&#148; he reassured her in the same vein. 
&#147;What if my ankle doesn&#146;t heal? What would you do to me if I couldn&#146;t
  perform as a ponygirl?&#148; 
&#147;Sell you for dog food probably.&#148; 
She hated his deadpan ripostes. His tone of voice for jokes sounded the same
  as his normal conversation. 
He interrupted Jessica&#146;s pouting silence. &#147;What are you getting
  at, Jessica? You know your ankle will heal fine. I&#146;ve seen the x-rays
  and medical report.&#148; 
&#147;Could I become a companion slave?&#148; 
Alex laughed. &#147;Slave Linsey&#146;s been putting ideas in your head. You
  think it&#146;s easy, sitting around looking pretty, dedicating your life to
  a single master, giving him that doe-eyed look of adoration every time he glances
  at you.&#148; 
&#147;No,&#148; Jessica protested, &#147;That&#146;s not what I...&#148; 
&#147;Companion slaves like Linsey undergo the most intensive and harshest
  training you could imagine. She was almost destroyed before being shaped into
  the person you see today. She&#146;ll never be free. She&#146;d sooner die!&#148; 
&#147;Sorry Sir, I didn&#146;t mean to make you angry.&#148; 
&#147;I&#146;m not angry, Jessica, just irritated that having been promised
  your freedom within a year you should be thinking of such things. Besides,
  there needs to be a master who wants a companion slave, someone who chooses
  you as his lifelong slave.&#148; 
&#147;It must be nice to belong to somebody. I&#146;ve seen the way Mr. Markham
  and Linsey look at each other.&#148; 
Alex had had enough. &#147;Jessica, what is it with you? After you&#146;re
  released, you can get married. Any man would want you as his wife. Then you&#146;ll
  be known by his name and the ring on your finger will indicate that you belong
  to him!&#148; He noticed Jessica&#146;s eyes welling up. &#147;Now, don&#146;t
  start crying or I&#146;ll give you something to cry about!&#148; 
&#147;I&#146;m not crying. I&#146;m just a little emotional and confused.
  Sir, yesterday I nearly died, and now I&#146;m on a beautiful ship sailing
  back to Rabbit Island. And Kate is with me, and Riccardo,&#148; she hesitated, &#147;and
  you too.&#148; 
&#147;It&#146;s good to have you back Jessica. I really did miss tying and
  teasing you.&#148; 
&#147;Is that the same as missing me?&#148; 
&#147;No Jessica. It&#146;s totally different. You misheard me yesterday.
  No more questions please. If you want a gag, just ask.&#148; 
Jessica didn&#146;t. Alex finished off the roping of her torso leaving her
  arms locked behind her in the Japanese style that resembled a ponygirl&#146;s
  strapping. He pulled the rope between her ass cheeks and threading it through
  the labial padlock, tugged until she winced with pain, then tied it off at
  her waist. He knew the crotch rope wouldn&#146;t stay there for long but enjoyed
  the pleasure of the tying and the exquisite grimace it produced on Jessica&#146;s
  face. 
The next stage was her suspension. Jessica looked up to see the ropes from
  her shoulders and chest fixed to an O bolt in the overhanging part of the deck
  above them. Alex made her stand on tiptoes to secure her at the desired height.  
He kissed her on the lips forcing hers open. He resistance was weak. She felt
  his tongue exploring and teasing her, tickling her taste buds. 
&#147;Just checking you&#146;re at the correct height. It&#146;s fun kissing
  you with that T-bar in your mouth. Perhaps we&#146;ll keep you that way. That&#146;s
  how the Rabbit Island committee would like to see the ponygirls fitted out.&#148; 
&#147;I can&#146;t wear a ballgag,&#148; said Jessica. 
&#147;No problem, we&#146;ll use special bit gags.&#148; 
Jessica couldn&#146;t help but smile. &#147;Sir, there&#146;s something else
  I can&#146;t get in my mouth.&#148; 
Alex looked puzzled for a few moments. &#147;I see what you mean,&#148; he
  responded thoughtfully. &#147;It&#146;s a good thing I&#146;m the manager of
  a slave island with plenty of mouths to choose from.&#148; 
Now it was Alex smiling. He pulled Jessica&#146;s right leg behind her so
  it was fully bent at the knee then tied a rope from her ankle to the O bolt
  above her head. After he repeated the process on her left ankle Jessica was
  floating in the air, her weight evenly distributed by the rope harness. 
He stood back checking that everything was safe and secure and watched Jessica&#146;s
  bound torso hanging perfectly upright and swinging slowly like a pendulum in
  response to the ship&#146;s mild yaw. 
&#147;Dance for me,&#148; he said. 
&#147;Dance? You&#146;ve suspended me in mid-air like I don&#146;t have feet,
  now you want me to dance?&#148; 
&#147;Dance, Jessica,&#148; he insisted. 
She tried to move, finding she could pull her knees forward a couple of inches,
  before the ankle ropes pulled them backwards again. She repeated it, imagining
  she was walking towards him. The padlock dangled prominently beneath her sex,
  tantalising yet denying them both. The crotch rope cut into her, giving more
  pain than pleasure, but it didn&#146;t stop her. She would endure the pain
  and wanted him to notice. 
Alex&#146;s arousal was obvious as Jessica&#146;s dance of self-inflicted
  pain continued. She gained in confidence feeling secure in his elaborate rope-work
  as she lured Alex towards her. But she was wrong about what had drawn him.
  It wasn&#146;t so much her body but the look on her face - her intense focus,
  her desire, her seriousness. 
&#147;Do you think you can get off with a crotch rope and that padlock rubbing
  against you?&#148; 
&#147;If you want me to I&#146;ll try.&#148; 
Alex reached into a pocket a removed a small brown envelope. He pulled a small
  key from it. &#147;I have a better idea.&#148; 
The padlock clicked open. He carefully extracted the round staple from Jessica&#146;s
  moist lower lips. Jessica gasped in pain and anticipation. 
He held it in front of her eyes. &#147;Nice padlock. Perhaps we&#146;ll keep
  it. A souvenir of your time on La Plata?&#148; 
Before Jessica could answer, he tossed it over his shoulder and into the sea. &#147;Perhaps
  not!&#148; He dropped his shorts, and Jessica&#146;s mid-air dance became desperate
  as she tried to widen her knees, to open herself to him. 
He gripped her upper arms and kissed her hard. Then he squatted a few inches
  down, coming up with her skewered on his cock. She moaned, open mouthed with
  long-denied pleasure. Her body, her whole being became concentrated on the
  area where their bodies were joined. 
&#147;Does that feel good?&#148; Alex asked, thrusting once.  
&#147;Mmm.&#148; Jessica hummed, straining forward to kiss his lips. He leant
  back a little to deny her. 
&#147;You&#146;re like a popsicle on my stick,&#148; he said, thrusting again. 
&#147;What flavour?&#148; Jessica gasped. 
His lips found hers, pushing them apart for his invading tongue. With hers
  locked down by the T bar, even her mouth had to yield as Alex explored and
  tasted her. 
Finally, he released her from his kiss. &#147;Honey!&#148; 
The teasing was over, and so was Jessica&#146;s long wait. 
THE SECOND KEY 
Later in the evening Alex noticed Riccardo pacing the deck as if the world
  were upon his shoulders. He leaned on the balustrade next to him. They looked
  out to sea, neither rushing to speak. 
&#147;How&#146;s Jessica?&#148; Riccardo finally asked. 
&#147;Slightly emotional, but the same Jessica, which is good. I&#146;ve left
  her in suspension for the crew to enjoy. I&#146;ll untie her shortly and send
  her to bed. And what about Kate, I thought she&#146;d be stowed away in your
  cabin by now?&#148; 
Riccardo seemed pensive, almost embarrassed. &#147;I have a small problem.&#148; 
&#147;Surely not? Go see Ranulph. He has all the right pills,&#148; Alex reassured
  him. 
&#147;Thanks, but the reason I can&#146;t perform is more physical than that.
  I know exactly what the problem is.&#148; He unbuckled his belt pushing his
  shorts down to his knees. &#147;It&#146;s one of Cavallo&#146;s innovations.&#148; 
Alex knelt down to look at the clear perspex device locked on Riccardo&#146;s
  flaccid penis, noticing the small padlock joining its parts together in front
  of the scrotum. He was trying not to laugh, thinking of Riccardo&#146;s similarity
  to Jessica. &#147;And you can&#146;t get it off?&#148; 
Riccardo sighed impatiently. &#147;Don&#146;t you think I&#146;ve tried? Even
  with a hacksaw blade I couldn&#146;t cut through it!&#148; 
&#147;What about using a key?&#148; Alex suggested. He dug in his pocket for
  the second small envelope. &#147;I was wondering what this one was used for.
  Almost threw it overboard earlier.&#148; 
Riccardo almost wept with joy as he snatched it from Alex&#146;s hand, pulling
  up his shorts as he dashed towards his room. 
&#147;Be gentle with her!&#148; Alex shouted after him. 
Gentle with Kate? Riccardo glanced over his shoulder incredulously, as if
  Alex had gone crazy. 
JESSICA UNDONE 
&#147;You don&#146;t look too exhausted,&#148; Alex commented as he examined
  Jessica&#146;s suspended body. 
&#147;That&#146;s because I can hardly move a muscle the way you&#146;ve tied
  me,&#148; Jessica explained without rancour. 
&#147;Only your internal muscles,&#148; Alex joked. &#147;How many men had
  you tonight?&#148; 
&#147;Three. The captain, first mate, and a crewman.&#148; 
&#147;Did you have an orgasm?&#148; 
&#147;Twice sir.&#148; 
&#147;Excellent. I expect you feel better now.&#148; Alex said. 
Jessica was unsure whether he was mocking her or expressing genuine concern.
  She was still confused by the manner in which he had taken her earlier, as
  if deliberately achieving his satisfaction without regard for her own. In previous
  times on Rabbit Island he was obsessed with her orgasms, stating that they
  signified victory for him and defeat for her. Or he might comment that her
  orgasm proved she was becoming a better slave. That particularly irritated
  her, which was partly why he said it. (The other reason he said it was that
  it was true.) 
Perhaps he was testing her? How would a companion slave react, she wondered.
  She&#146;d be trusting, uncomplaining, and eager to serve her master in any
  way he saw fit. 
Alex tenderly wiped her inner thighs with a tissue then rubbed the semen stained
  tissue over her labia until her body reacted with an involuntary twitch. &#147;I
  can&#146;t believe they removed your pony piercings,&#148; he commented with
  evident annoyance. &#147;That&#146;ll be the first job when we get back.&#148; 
He released her from suspension then slowly loosened the grip of rope on her
  body. Suddenly he asked: &#147;Would you like to know what happened to Nancy?&#148; 
&#147;Nancy? Yes! Where is she?&#148; 
&#147;She&#146;s in Bangkok being looked after by my friend Charlie, the guy
  that kidnapped you for Rabbit Island. Her escape didn&#146;t exactly go to
  plan, although she got further than you and Kate did. We had to buy her back
  from kidnappers who were holding her for ransom deep in the jungle.&#148; 
&#147;Is she okay?&#148; 
&#147;She&#146;s fine. Sitting in a cage and watching television with Charlie
  right now I would guess.&#148; 
&#147;You&#146;re bringing her back to Rabbit Island, right?&#148; 
Alex nodded. &#147;To be punished.&#148; 
Jessica frowned, recalling the punishment that followed her own escape.  
&#147;You survived and so will Nancy.&#148; 
She smiled. &#147;It&#146;ll be good to see her again.&#148; 
&#147;It&#146;ll be good to see all of you together again.&#148; 
Jessica agreed. &#147;I can&#146;t wait!&#148; The sarcasm she intended failed
  to happen. 
Alex had freed her of all ropes, except that their deep impressions lingered
  all over her torso like exotic bondage art. Alex liked it and wanted to return
  to the main lounge to 'show her off'. The rope marks, not her, he clarified. 
&#147;I feel kind of undressed.&#148; 
Alex looked at her quizzically. &#147;You are undressed!&#148; 
&#147;I mean not being bound.&#148; 
&#147;Are you scared?&#148; 
Jessica pondered for a second. &#147;Yes, I suppose so.&#148; 
&#147;Scared of what you might do?&#148; 
&#147;No sir. Scared of what I should do.&#148; 
Alex gestured to the dark expanse of the Pacific all around them. &#147;Escape?
  Attack me? Jessica, it&#146;s not chains that make you a slave. It&#146;s your
  obedience and submission; and understanding that rebellion brings punishment
  and unhappiness, while obedience will bring rewards. You have nothing to be
  ashamed of.&#148; 
Ashamed? Those last words seemed to buzz around in the air, annoying her like
  a persistent mosquito. She resented the banality of the statement, and wondered
  why Alex said it. 
He stood quiet, impassive and patient, expecting that the next word or gesture
  be Jessica&#146;s.  
She held her hands together, palm-to-palm, offering them to him, and looked
  not at his feet but directly and intently in the eyes, as if to say &#145;I&#146;m
  not ashamed&#146;.  
Alex picked up a rope and wrapped it around her offered wrists, using the
  trailing end to lead her back into the main lounge area. The rope connecting
  them seemed alive, charged with something powerful, confusing, and reassuring
  too. 
In the lounge they noticed Linsey lying sideways, hogtied on the seating,
  her cheek resting on Ranulph Markham&#146;s thigh. He stroked her hair idly,
  coiling it around his finger, but his attention was on Vince. 
Karen Galtz sat on the floor at Vince&#146;s feet. Her collar and its connecting
  chains to her separate wrist cuffs didn&#146;t hinder her in the task she was
  diligently performing for Vince. Nor did the ballgag she wore. Whilst Markham
  listened and Vince talked, Karen wrote his words in shorthand in a notebook
  as he recounted the story of Nancy&#146;s escape, her kidnap, and subsequent
  rescue by him and Alex. Markham suggested it would make a good story, and Karen
  as a journalist was keen to record it. 
Alex sat down, and Jessica, without prompting sat on the floor between his
  legs, confident that obedience brings rewards.  
Vince&#146;s story was occasionally interrupted by noises elsewhere on the
  ship. Riccardo and Kate&#146;s noise came from his room, while Cormack was
  putting Rachel through her paces on the open deck. Jessica heard their screams
  yet wasn&#146;t concerned. At that moment it felt like a happy ship. 
LYING IN BED 
Jessica had just got into bed when Kate entered the room. 
&#147;What ya doing Jessi?&#148; Kate asked, seeing Jessica snap the ankle
  restraints on herself.  
Jessica smoothed the covers over her, locating the shackles at the top of
  the bed. &#147;Master Alex said we had to fix ourselves to the beds before
  we sleep.&#148; 
Kate pouted. &#147;Aw, that&#146;s not fair. I wanted to have my revenge with
  you tomorrow morning for raping a poor little ponygirl as if you were one of
  Brenda&#146;s girls.&#148; 
&#147;I was only following orders. Besides, your high stepping was a disgrace
  to a ponygirl uniform. You deserved it!&#148; 
&#147;Dyke!&#148; Kate teased, as she went to the bathroom. After completing
  her hygienic essentials Kate climbed into her bed across from Jessica and grumpily
  fixing the cuffs on her wrists and ankles. She turned over a couple of times,
  exploring the extent of her movement and resigning herself that there was no
  escape from her self-inflicted bondage, nor any sensual pleasure while she
  slept. Her fingertips weren&#146;t able to reach further down than her nose.
  She looked across the three-foot gap at Jessica, now similarly fixed. &#147;Jessi,
  I know you&#146;re a bondage whore who&#146;ll do anything Master Alex tells
  you, but why exactly are you smiling like that?&#148; 
&#147;I lied. He only asked me to chain myself, he didn&#146;t mention you.&#148; 
Kate pulled on her chains. &#147;You bitch. You crazy bitch! Just you wait,
  I&#146;m gonna get a double revenge on you when I get out of this.&#148; 
By then Jessica was laughing to the point of tears, and Kate, resigned to
  her predicament, soon joined her.

Chapter 24. Return to Rabbit Island   
(Even Ponygirls Sometimes Get the Blues, by Aurelius)  
The story so far:    
 (Ch. 20) Kate's escape from the Breeding Shed  
 (Ch. 21) Cavallo's operation,  
 (Ch. 22) In the dungeon. Jessica faces the guillotine  
 (Ch. 23) On board the Slave to Fortune.   
 The last full day at sea on the voyage back to Rabbit Island was as informal
  as the previous one: more deck scrubbing and metal polishing for Jessica and
  her naked shipmates, while Riccardo reprised his role as the Hosemaster  .
  It was obvious that he got a kick out of accidentally spraying the deck slaves
  with water as they scrubbed. They couldn't really complain. It was better than
  being whipped. They did however tire of Riccardo's constant threats to give
  any slacker a high-pressure enema.  
 Lunch was served on the deck... literally. Jessica, Kate, Rachel and Karen
  were told to kneel side-by-side. Cormack bound their wrists behind their backs
  with a one continuous length of heavy rope tying and linking them. Chopped-up
  cubes of sandwiches and leftovers from the previous night's supper were piled
  neatly in front of each of them. Riccardo's earlier insistence that the deck
  should be clean enough to eat off now made perfect sense.  
 A few yards in front of them a lunch table had been set. Jessica gazed on
  enviously as Linsey knelt at Markham's feet, being hand fed by him like a favourite
  pet - which of course she was. Jessica received nothing but a couple of derisory
  glances from Master Alex. She was annoyed at herself for expecting more.  
 The late afternoon body baths were especially anticipated today, since it
  was announced that the men were drawing lots to decide which one of them would
  also receive the treatment. Everyone except Markham and Alex were in the draw,
  including the crew. As they scrubbed the top deck the washer slaves exchanged
  snatched comments on who they hoped would 'win'. Such talk was quickly curtailed
  by the Hosemaster, hovering close by, with yet more of his tiresome enema threats.  
 The time came. Ranulph Markham had prepared some playing cards, one to be
  picked by each man. The one who chooses the Joker gets the sponge bath, he
  announced. It was one of those rare occasions when the men were more nervous
  than their slaves.  
 Each man pulled a card from the fanned selection Markham offered. They obeyed
  his instruction not to show their card until all had picked, nonetheless a
  few sighed with obvious relief as they snuck a look at their card.  
 One by one they each gleefully revealed their cards to the others until
  only Riccardo and Vince remained. Vince displayed the two of clubs, "I'm jealous
  of you Riccardo, really I am." He wasn't sure if his sarcasm was genuine. Nor
  were the others.  
 Riccardo looked quizzically at Ranulph Markham. "I get down on my hands
  and knees and they wash me?"  
 "Exactly! No more, no less. Look, the buckets of warm water are ready. You
  don't want a cold bath do you?"  
 Riccardo warily removed his polo shirt, shorts and underwear, fastidiously
  hanging them on the back of a deck chair. He wasn't shy about showing his toned
  naked body in front of other men, although yesterday, when wearing the chastity
  device on his penis, it might have been very different. But then, seeing the
  four luscious naked females waiting, sponges at the ready, he wondered whether
  that devilish perspex cylinder might have served a purpose after all. He was
  already becoming aroused and tried to hide his erection from the other men.  
 The washer girls were kneeling in a circle and Riccardo tentatively took
  up the all-fours position within. Alex deputised as the Hosemaster, giving
  Riccardo a taste of his own medicine with a high-powered jet of water onto
  his balls. Jessica held up a sponge for Alex to soak. He aimed the hose at
  it, giving tacit approval to Jessica's next task.  
 "No way!" Riccardo said, as Jessica offered the soaking sponge to his lips.  
 "It'll stop you swallowing the soap, Sir. That's what you told us yesterday." Jessica's
  smile was as broad as he had ever seen on his erstwhile ponygirl. "Please sir,
  I'm only obeying instructions."  
 Riccardo decided to get it over with, allowing Jessica to push the sponge
  in his mouth, figuring that the sooner they start the sooner it would be over.  
 Kate eagerly scooted around to take position behind him, giving the impression
  that she'd fight the others for that place if she had to. She set about her
  task with the same vigour she used on the decks and felt Riccardo's erection
  forming in the palms of her hands.  
 By contrast Jessica washed Riccardo's handsome face with loving care. She
  was almost in tears, confused at how she could feel such tenderness towards
  a man who must have whipped her buttocks a thousand times at least. Then she
  noticed a change in Riccardo's eyes, something close to panic, surprised that
  she would have affected him so.  
 Then Jessica looked across Riccardo's soapy back and saw that Kate was working
  almost too hard, like when she was removing a stubborn splatter of gull shit
  from the deck. Riccardo could, and should, have stood up, but with Rachel and
  Karen at his sides pressing down on his back as they washed his chest, that
  wasn't so easy. By then he had passed the point when a man no longer thinks
  with his brain. And Kate knew it! Running her two hands and a soapy sponge
  up and down his hard cock, she had just one objective and nobody seemed inclined
  to stop her.  
 Riccardo closed his eyes, wordless guttural growls coming from his sponge-filled
  mouth while Kate's loving hands massaged his ejaculating cock, not ceasing
  in her attention until it lay flaccid and spent in her hands.  
 The watching men whooped and applauded - congratulating Riccardo and the
  deck slaves alike. It had gone just as Markham expected, perhaps even better.  
 After a well-aimed rinse-down from Alex, Riccardo hooked the sponge out
  of his mouth, stood up and reached for a large towel. A wag of his finger told
  Kate that her punishment would come later. Somehow it seemed more of a promise
  than a threat.  
 "That was... interesting. Quite pleasant really," Riccardo commented, almost
  managing to look his friends in the eyes. He seemed dazed, almost shell-shocked. "Embarrassing,
  but really quite pleasant."  
 "We're not done yet," Markham announced to the men. "Check to see if there
  is anything written on your card."  
 Vince looked puzzled as he read his card. "A day of chastity?"  
 Markham solemnly handed him Riccardo's former chastity device. "If you need
  a hand fitting it, I'm sure Riccardo can help out."  
 Vince held it up, dangling it from pinched fingers. "Jesus, I'm not sure
  Riccardo's size will fit me. What if I break it and Riccardo can't wear it
  anymore? Looks like he could have used it just now."  
 "The time starts immediately," Markham informed him. Vince shrugged, and
  went to his room to fit the device. How bad could a night of abstinence be?
  He'd done it often, although had been looking forward to more fun with Karen,
  or perhaps Rachel if Cormack was willing to swap.  
 Cormack looked puzzled as he read out his card. "It says 'duet'? I can't
  sing!"  
 Markham explained: "No singing required. I'm sure you've noticed that we
  have an odd number of slaves on board. So, for the duets show we need somebody
  to make up the numbers. You'll be fully tied to one of the slaves all evening."  
 "Can I choose?" asked Cormack glancing towards Rachel. She looked modestly
  downwards to the deck, unable to suppress her coy smile.  
EVENING DUETS   
 "Jessica can go with Linsey," Markham directed, as he organised the evening's
  activity. "Cormack, would you be so kind as to secure them as we discussed
  earlier?"  
 Cormack smiled. "My pleasure!" He took Jessica by her arm to the cleared
  floorspace where Linsey was already sat. With her wrists tied behind her Jessica
  wasn't planning to resist this hulk of a man. "Sit down, face to face with
  Linsey," he instructed her. She obeyed, not even daring to display the surly,
  resentful expression she often used with Master Alex or the Rabbit Island crew.  
 "Touching!" Cormack rebuked them. His boat shoe tapped Jessica's coccyx.
  She slid her buttocks forward until she was sat with her breasts squashed into
  Linsey's. Cormack smiled upon seeing the melding of breasts. "Now wrap your
  legs around each other." He bent down to tie Jessica's ankles to Linsey's wrists,
  then repeated the action with Linsey's ankles to Jessica's wrists.  
 Linsey was soon tickling Jessica's conveniently-placed feet, hoping for
  a reaction from her, and trying to establish eye contact, while Jessica was
  still adjusting to her unfamiliar position. Jessica leant backwards a little
  in a vain attempt to establish some personal space. But Cormack wasn't quite
  done. The two pairs of ringed nipples rubbing against each other were too tempting.
  He snapped small padlocks onto their touching nipple rings. Now if Jessica
  leant back Linsey came with her. To have reins attached to her nipples was
  normal, or sometimes chains, or perhaps bells, but never another woman locked
  onto them. Not even the most adept finger could compete with another woman's
  nipples pressing into hers.  
 Linsey began her wordless seduction. Although they were equals in bondage
  Jessica felt she was the victim, with Linsey her captor and seducer. Her sex
  remained untouched and untouchable despite Linsey's attempts to wriggle her
  body into even closer contact. When Linsey kissed her Jessica's mouth opened
  as slowly as her eyes closed. The kiss was long and deep, an unequal contest
  with Jessica's tongue disabled by the T-bar. She became oblivious to everything
  else around her as Linsey's sensual, exotic and fragrant body held her in thrall.  
 Kate and Karen were then fixed into their duet, Kate on top of a doggie-style
  Karen. The strap-on dildo of which Kate had been on the receiving end the previous
  evening was now strapped around her own loins, then thrust up to its hilt into
  Karen's sex. Their bodies were tied together to ensure they stayed that way.
  Kate tried to apologise for her actions but her ballgag meant she could only
  moan and dribble onto her trapped friend like a lusty dog.  
 Cormack accepted his duet with Rachel with surprisingly good grace, crouching
  over her all-fours position and allowing his hands and ankles to be tied to
  hers. His bulk seemed to swallow her up beneath him. For the sake of male decorum,
  and to cool his lust Cormack stayed dressed in a polo shirt, shorts and boat
  shoes. Rachel wore nothing but a blindfold, and expression of intense concentration
  rather than fear. He kissed her neck, nibbling it, rubbing her ear with his
  nose, then simulated a thrust of his hips into her.  
 At the dining table, Markham set the table for contract bridge. This evening
  was his final attempt to pass the finer aspects of the game to Alex, who was
  showing great promise.  
 Riccardo was understandably distracted by Kate and Karen's involuntary sex
  act. Seeing the harness straps around Kate's waist and dissecting her butt
  cheeks had ignited his fire. He began to think that the male chastity device
  worn by pony drivers on La Plata wasn't such a bad idea after all. He took
  his place occupying the seat with his back to the duets show.  
 Vince, forced to wear the chastity device for the night, began to appreciate
  its advantages. With no prospect of achieving a hard-on, and hence an orgasm,
  he could enjoy the duet show for as long as he cared to.  
 "You don't want to play?" Alex asked Vince.  
 "Not with you guys," Vince replied, nodding in the direction of the duets.  
 "I'll play!" Cormack called out immediately from his kneeling position.
  He rose to his feet with Rachel still attached to him. "I'm still tied to the
  girl as required. Don't worry, she's blindfolded so she won't be able to help
  me."  
 The men shrugged. Cormack had a point. He curled an arm around Rachel's
  belly, holding her like a ragdoll, tight against him, as he took his seat at
  the card table. She was sat on his lap, her wrists and ankles still tied to
  his. Instead of bondage making her immobile it had been used so she no long
  had control of her body. Rachel's hands shadowed Cormack's each and every move,
  flinging forward as he laid cards on the table, then back to her chest as he
  reviewed cards.  
 Cormack developed an annoying habit of flicking his cards back and forth
  over her nipples while waiting for others to play. He liked the way they grew
  in response, and the way Rachel whimpered, trapped between shame and desire.
  Alex was envious of the pair, but was resigned that he didn't have the size
  and weight advantage to replicate Cormack's feat.  
 Markham noticed Alex's lingering glance at Jessica and Linsey. "I think
  my slave's found a new friend!"  
 "It's such a friendly position, I'm not surprised," Alex chuckled.  
 Cormack only lasted a few rubbers (of bridge!) before excusing himself for
  a bathroom break. The men's habit while on board was to use the improvised
  urinal on the rear patio deck - a large fuel funnel with a length of tube dropping
  into the sea through a drain hole.  
 Rachel gasped as Cormack pulled her arms behind her back so he could unzip
  his fly. The only tension between them was sexual and mutual. He pushed her
  belly hard against the gunwale, bending her forward so her head was over the
  water. She felt something large rubbing against her inner thighs. "I thought
  you were just going to the bathroom," she gasped.  
 "I'd like to, but a man can't piss with a hard-on! Open up and hold still,
  it isn't easy without using my hands."  
 She felt the wet tip of his insistent penis push against her perineum, exciting
  her even further. After adjusting the shape of his body it plunged fully into
  her, lifting her as far as she could go with her ankles still tied to his.
  She felt an exquisite stretch of her legs and a fullness inside she had never
  known before. Bound so intimately to this hunk, she hoped some magical curse
  would make it impossible to untie the ropes that bound them. Persuaded by his
  kisses, it didn't feel like sex or rape, but as if she was possessed and enfolded
  by him.  
 Forgetting herself, Rachel signified her orgasm with a yell, uninhibited
  by the darkness of her blindfold, and the exhilarating sea breeze.  
GOOD COMPANIONS   
 Markham and Alex looked across to the two duets on the polished wood floor.
  Unlike Cormack, these weren't going anywhere.  
 Karen, still on all-fours, and on top of her Kate, her reluctant rapist,
  appeared exhausted. At first Karen had protested and complained about the movement
  of the dildo as Kate tried to get comfortable, but soon the inevitable happened
  as their combined body heat increased. Karen directed Kate's thrusts, reasoning
  she would feel better, more relaxed, after an orgasm rather than maintaining
  her state of enforced arousal. The dribble from Kate's ballgagged mouth above
  her ran down her both sides of her face.  
 Meanwhile Jessica and Linsey continued their delicate never-ending foreplay,
  bodies pressed together but unable to gain the friction below the waist they
  both craved.  
 "Exquisite, aren't they?" Markham commented, as if looking at fine porcelain.  
 Alex agreed, although he might have used a coarser expression. The blindfolded
  Jessica was unknowingly testing his self-control.  
 "My companion slave with your future companion slave. What a pair they make!"  
 Alex became a little irritated, and replied in barely a whisper. "Shhh!
  I already said I can't have a companion slave with the life I lead. I travel
  too much. And if I do take a companion slave it won't be Jessica."  
 Markham raised his eyebrows. "What's wrong? She's pretty. Nice temperament.
  And I think she likes you. A ponygirl not good enough for you?"  
 Alex chuckled, knowing that ponygirls were definitely good enough for him,
  but he wasn't enjoying the gentle probing. "I assure you that isn't the reason.
  It's more complicated that than. Something I'd rather not talk about. At least
  not yet."  
 "Suit yourself old boy! But that former companion slave on the island..."  
 "Carol?"  
 "Yes, Carol. She can help train her. So how is Carol doing these days? How
  terrible to lose her companion master at such a young age! Does she ever talk
  about her days as a companion slave?"  
 Alex shook his head. "No, she doesn't like to talk about it. Do you know
  what happened?"  
 Markham leant forward, speaking in barely a whisper. "When her master was
  killed in that terrible car wreck, she was given the choice whether to live
  or die. A bereaved companion slave will never be sold, nor can they ever be
  with another master. Many of them choose to die. It's an inevitable consequence
  of their conditioning. After several days in her bedroom looking at a deadly
  concoction of pills Carol finally accepted an offer. Like many of those who
  choose to live, she opted for a complete change of environment, swapping New
  Hampshire for your sunny island on the other side of the world."  
 "We're glad to have her, she's a very talented beautician, not that our
  bunnies need much help. She seems to like the pace of our island life." said
  Alex. "You're right about one thing, to my knowledge she's never been with
  a man in the time I've known her. She is a free woman, but sometimes she feels
  the urge to be disciplined, or punished for some arbitrary offence. Her favourite,
  or perhaps it's the one she hates most, is the four hole stock."  
 He was referring to the iron bar with four circular fixtures in a row used
  for pinning a slave in the lowliest of positions: kneeling with her face rubbing
  on the floor. Her arms are in front of her, her wrists are pulled between her
  knees and secured into the two central circles, flanked on either side by her
  secured ankles. With her upturned ass, bare back and accessible vagina and
  anus, there is no end to the torments that could be inflicted on her.  
 Alex continued: "I put her in one a few weeks ago. Vibrated her clit to
  several orgasms, whipped her buttocks 'til she bled and then left her to stew
  for a few hours. She was a picture of misery when I returned to release her,
  and yet, later in the evening she was happier than ever. 'That'll keep me going
  for a few weeks', she said to me."  
 "Stop changing the subject, Alex. You have the perfect opportunity to get
  yourself a beautiful, properly trained companion slave. If the time isn't right
  now, just keep her on the Island as a ponygirl for five or ten years, until
  you're in a position to take her. What's all this nonsense about wiping her
  memory and releasing her in a year? You owe her nothing!"  
 Alex glanced over to Jessica and Linsey. Their tender kisses couldn't disguise
  the fact that they were listening, or at least trying to. He coughed. "Time
  now to change the subject. In fact I think it's time to change our subjects
  too. Jessica and Linsey have been at it for long enough. You don't happen to
  have a four hole stock do you?"  
LAND AHOY  !  
 "Land ahoy!" came the shout from the top deck.  
 Jessica turned over in her bed, burying her face in the sheet to avoid facing
  the morning sunshine and the fact that she would be stepping on Rabbit Island
  again in a few hours. Her thoughts turned to the previous night and talk of
  companion slaves. Being so initimately tied to one, and tasting her kisses,
  while listening to the men talking about companion slaves had disturbed her.
  She had come to regard Master Alex as the sole barometer of her self-worth.
  His comment to Markham about freeing her in a year was lost in the fog of her
  sense of rejection. At that moment, perhaps through a lack of vision, she wanted
  desperately to be a companion slave. She wanted to be his  companion
  slave, to have the kind of relationship that Ranulph Markham and Linsey enjoyed.  
 Her wrists were still sore from last night's exertions. The delicious frustrations
  of being tied face to face, belly to belly with Linsey, being aroused by her
  kisses yet unable to do anything about the hot tingle building up in her body
  was followed by the four hole stocks. Following Alex's comment about putting
  Carol in one, Markham suggested they try his new design, smooth stainless steel
  instead of the usual heavy iron. As luck would have it there were two of them
  on the ship's toy chest.  
 Jessica and Linsey were fitted into the four hole stocks and positioned
  side-by-side. Alex started his assault with a Hitachi vibrator, while Ranulph
  Markham continued his attack on a bottle of 1985 Claret. Jessica was still
  blindfolded but she knew well the sensation of Alex's firm hands on her buttocks.
  He pinched and pulled her labia, saying to Markham, "I love these lips." (Yes,
  he had drunk more than usual.)  
 "You could at least give her a kiss!" Markham teased from the comfort of
  his dining chair. He'd noticed that Alex was less inhibited than usual. Alex's
  fingers let go of Jessica's flesh and a few moments later, crouching down awkwardly
  behind her, he kissed her. Just one simple kiss, but as Kate might say, 'a
  kiss down below is worth a hundred on the face.'  
 More than a hundred, Jessica thought, as she lay in bed recalling the exquisite
  orgasm Alex and a Hitachi vibrator gave her. She looked at the handcuffs that
  held her arms at the top of the bed, cursing that she could not reach down
  to give that sweet memory an accompanying touch. The strange thing was that
  she didn't remember cuffing her own wrists to the bed before she went to sleep.
  Perhaps someone else had done it, such as Kate, in revenge for the con trick
  she had pulled the previous night? She turned over expecting to look at Kate
  in the opposite bunk, but it was empty and, judging by the made up covers,
  had not been slept in. Then Jessica remembered. In the middle of the night,
  disturbed and unsettled by a strange dream, she had fixed the cuffs on herself,
  seeking their security and protection.  
BUNNY CHAINS   
 Jessica fell asleep again, before being roused a half-hour later. Just like
  the previous mornings, breakfast was taken while sitting on the deck. Every
  sip and mouthful of the orange juice, coffee and croissants was savoured while
  they gazed at Rabbit Island's large gently rounded hump looming ever larger.
  It looked so lush and green, it being at the tail end of the rainy season.
  Compared to the horrors of La Plata, with its appropriate grey jagged peaks,
  this island was paradise. But they weren't quite ready for it. Jessica and
  Kate thought they had found paradise on the Slave to Fortune.  
 Vince appeared on deck carrying a canvas bag. "Vacation's over!" he announced
  with obvious relish. He emptied the contents of the bag onto the deck. Four
  female hearts sank upon seeing its contents, and Vince noticed.  
 "You've been spoilt these last few days, but now it's back to Rabbit Island
  ways. He picked up to first collar and chain and read the inscription on the
  collar, "bunny Kate!"  
 "But I'm a pussygirl, and a nurse," she protested.  
 "I know you are, babe, but you still get a bunny chain."  
 Kate sighed with resignation and held her hands together behind her. Vince
  put the collar on first, buckling and padlocking it at the front, then placed
  her wrists in the handcuffs fixed to a chromed chain dangling from the back
  of the collar. Kate gave a perfunctory tug of her wrists and a glance over
  her shoulder. It all felt so familiar, making her feel she was back on Rabbit
  Island already.  
 "Bunny Jessica! Step forward. And before you say it... yes I know you're
  a ponygirl!"  
 Jessica smiled. She felt the one-inch diameter collar draw tight around
  her neck. She lifted her chin proudly to allow Vince to buckle and lock her.
  Ponygirls learned to enjoy being dressed by men, even if the dressing was only
  a harness and bridle. She took her place alongside Kate, even though they had
  not been asked to line up in any fashion.  
 Kate looked at the engraved tag fixed onto the side of Jessica's collar "It's
  got your name on it, Jessi."  
 Jessica gave a sardonic chuckle. "Oh, isn't that sweet of them? Our welcome
  back gift is made-to-measure bunny chains!"  
 "They're quite a good fit actually," said Kate, "not so bad at all."  
 "You're right," Vince interjected, as he dispatched Karen with a playful
  slap on the behind. "The collar is made to your exact size, only one buckle
  hole so it has a neat tail, the handcuffs close only to your own wrist size,
  and the back chain is at the correct length for each of you. Very pretty you
  all look too!"  
 Jessica sneered and wrinkled her nose at Vince, Karen muttered an obscenity,
  while Kate accepted the compliment with a smile.  
 Rachel puffed with frustration and sank dejected to the deck. She seemed
  more distressed by the return of chains than anybody. Three days on board the
  Slave to Fortune as the lustful object of Cormack's attentions had left more
  than just physical marks. She couldn't remember feeling anything as good as
  his big muscular body pressing against her. The bunny chains signified that
  those times were over. She looked enviously at Kate, who was squinting, perhaps
  smiling, in the sunshine without a care in the world. Things were okay for
  Kate, she had an interesting job as the island's nurse, and would no doubt
  continue to enjoy the lustful attentions of Riccardo. But for Rachel there
  was only life as a beach bunny to look forward to, while Cormack was working
  on the other side of the world.  
DOCKED   
 The four slaves were left on deck, unmolested and generally ignored while
  the owner, crew and guests busied themselves with packing and other preparations
  prior to docking.  
 One thing Jessica had never got used was a slave's utter lack of possessions,
  not the slightest trinket or keepsake. Even a typical family dog has more stuff.
  Perhaps that was why the new bunny chains, with her name neatly engraved on
  the collar, gave her such mixed feelings. They were hers in a sense, even if
  the leather collar and steel cuffs encircled and restrained her. She thought
  about her ponyboots - surely having made the journey to La Plata and back again,
  they were considered hers? And there were her harnesses - two complete sets.
  Would they be waiting for her on Rabbit Island? The prospect of being strapped
  up again in her working harness was not such an unpleasant thought, far preferable
  to breaking in a new harness.  
 "Katie, do you have any possessions with you?" she asked.  
 Kate gave Jessica a puzzled look, and nodded down at her clean-shaven sex. "I
  keep my credit cards down there. Seldom carry much cash these days."  
 "Very funny! I mean, do you think that those new chains or, for example,
  your little nurse's apron are possessions?"  
 "That's a good question, Jessi. They're not really possessions, are they?
  More like equipment assigned to us. I know it's stupid, but it's nice to be
  wearing a collar with my name on it. More personal I suppose. I can tell these
  are good quality too. Soft leather, custom fitted cuffs. Not too tight or too
  loose." She stretched her arms out behind her to the extent of the collar's
  connecting chain. "Yep, in slave terms, I'd say we've arrived!"  
 Jessica laughed, and looked towards the approaching jetty. "We have now."  
 Riccardo and Vince returned briefly to the top deck to drop the large cushioning
  fenders over the left-hand side of the boat. Both men were in good spirits,
  evidently pleased to be returning to the island. "Well, look at that! They've
  extended the jetty," Riccardo commented as they headed for opposite ends of
  the ship.  
 Vince expertly threw the line from the bow onto the adjacent bollard on
  the jetty. The noise of the ship's engine, a constant companion for the last
  few days, fell silent and gradually the stern eased in toward the jetty. Riccardo
  dropped the eye of the line over the bollard, pulled it taut, and quickly tied
  it off with a figure of eight.  
 "Not a soul. The place looks deserted," observed Kate.  
 "No ponygirls to meet us," Jessica observed sadly, expecting hopefully to
  see her friends again. Usually when a boat docks, at least one pair of ponygirls,
  with trailer attached, would be waiting to take goods, luggage or visitors
  up to the Lodge. The ponygirls had a ceremonial function too. Just as a bagpiper
  might greet your arrival in Scotland so the sight of a well turned-out ponygirl
  provided a fitting welcome to Rabbit Island. It was one errand that Jessica,
  as a ponygirl, looked forward to - a chance to see who and what was disembarking,
  a rare chance for a ponygirl to be the first to know something, instead of
  the last.  
 They disembarked as a group, and walked up to the lodge on foot, taking
  the wooden staircase cut into the rocky cliff-face instead of the long gradual
  incline of the trail. The cliff wasn't large, the height of a four-story building,
  but after lounging around on boats and prison cells for the last couple of
  weeks the slaves were all puffing for breath (with Kate complaining of exhaustion)
  by the time they reached the top. Jessica did well to cover her slight lack
  of breath. As a ponygirl she could be whipped for showing such weakness.  
 Perhaps they were complacent, but Jessica and company half-expected the
  Slave to Fortune party would continue in the Lodge's main hall, or perhaps
  in somebody's bedroom. Instead they were marched straight to the cellblock.
  Alex, Ranulph Markham and the ship's crew had peeled off without Jessica noticing.
  It was left to Vince and Riccardo to lock them up.  
 The cellblock smelt of paint, and the brightly coloured walls indicated
  that somebody had been busy very recently. An improvement - Jessica thought
  - cool pastel shades replaced the previously stark white walls. When the solid
  gloss white painted cell door opened she could see that the cells had also
  benefited from a makeover.  
 The door slammed shut behind her, and Jessica was once again just another
  Rabbit Island prisoner. She sat on the bed which ran fully crossways against
  the wall opposite the door. Then she noticed the small window above the bed.
  She stood on the soft mattress to peer out. It overlooked the cobbled courtyard
  where ponygirls were harnessed to their carts and where, on the heavy wooden
  A-frames their subsequent punishments were delivered. It was deserted which
  made her feel strangely sad. Better to be out there than stuck in a cell, she
  felt.  
 She liked the small woven rug on the floor. It reminded her of a prayer
  mat, and its purpose was not so different. She was to spend a lot of time kneeling
  on it. It seemed to beckon her, so eschewing the comfort of the bed she knelt
  down on the rug, knees wide, her back bolt upright and chin raised. The downward
  tug of her cuffed wrists on her thick leather collar demanded a good posture.
  She closed her eyes and breathed deeply, improvising a self-styled meditation.
  It was good to be 'home', away from the terrors of La Plata, but she suspected
  things might be different on Rabbit Island now.  
 Those differences soon became apparent.

Chapter 25. The High-Tech Cell  
(Even Ponygirls Sometimes Get the Blues, by Aurelius)  
The story so far:    
 (Ch. 21) Jessica's Operation  
 (Ch. 22) The dungeon. Jessica faces the Guillotine.  
 (Ch. 23) On board the Slave to Fortune.  
 (Ch. 24) The Slave to Fortune lands at Rabbit Island. Jessica in the cellblock.  
 Jessica had been kneeling on the colourful woven mat for half an hour. Meditating,
  wondering where her life was going. Feeling guilty about how long it was since
  she thought about home in New York, her parents, her career and friends. Her
  nostalgic thoughts were interrupted by a recorded voice.  
 "Welcome to Rabbit Island, one of the world's premier slave islands."  
 The voice was of a young woman sounding like a tour guide. Jessica looked
  to the side of the cell door and saw a flat screen television had come to life
  with pretty woman with short blonde hair. At first Jessica didn't recognise
  pussygirl Lucy. Then it all made sense. Lucy had been a promising television
  news journalist before her abduction and sale to Rabbit Island. It seemed that
  captivity hadn't ended her media career after all.  
 The studio set was a cell - the mirror image of Jessica's. Lucy wore nothing
  but a leather collar and, to judge by the way her hands were hidden behind
  her, she was fixed into bunny chains too. Jessica was sorry to see that Lucy
  had lost her cascading blonde tresses, then Lucy turned to show her hair had
  been plaited and pinned to the back of her head. Any new prisoner with long
  hair would get the same pinned-up style, purely to reduce the maintenance of
  long hair. Jessica, with her centimetre hair length, had no need of such treatment.  
 "You have been brought here to participate in this island's lifestyle, and
  although you did not choose to come, you were  chosen,
  because of your sexual preferences as well as your good looks. You are in a
  place that understands those god-given urges you have to be forced, dominated,
  controlled, restrained, punished and humiliated. Here, with or without your
  consent, you will explore the full depths of your desires. You will go to places
  that you thought only possible in your most shameful and masochistic fantasies."  
 It was a fair assessment, Jessica thought. They might not have been Lucy's
  words but she delivered them as if she knew well of what she spoke.  
 The picture changed to moving aerial images of the island shot from a low-flying
  helicopter. Jessica was fascinated at seeing her island home from the air,
  just as any resident in any neighbourhood would be. It didn't surprise her
  how beautiful it looked, an oval-shaped oasis of lush green, trimmed with white
  sand and surrounded by a turquoise sea.  
 Lucy continued her commentary. "This complex of buildings is called The
  Lodge, the island's headquarters. It's where you are now, in the narrow block
  on the left. There are thirty guest rooms, plus offices, activity rooms and
  a main hall. Adjoining the cell-block in the large square building is the building
  where the ponygirls live..."  
 "And where I should be now!" Jessica barked at the video screen.  
 "We have three bunny cabins located around the island, each on a beautiful
  stretch of sandy beach. This is where most of the slaves live. Once you have
  passed the induction examinations, you will be released into one of these camps,
  and will live there until you are required back at the Lodge. You'll wear the
  same chains that you and I are wearing now."  
 "This is the Orchard, which is what we call the group of buildings in the
  middle of the cultivated heart of the island. We grow most of our own food,
  and are self-sufficient in electricity due to the solar panels and slave-powered
  generators which orchard slaves may have to power on static bicycles on busy
  evenings."  
 "All parts of the island are linked by narrow trails. We use environment-friendly
  ponygirls for all our transportation needs. There go two of them now."  
 This shot was taken from the side of a trail and showed two ponygirls approaching
  at a trot. Because of the foreshortened camera angle they didn't appear to
  be going fast, then suddenly they reached the camera, which swung around rapidly
  to record them running into the distance, driver and trailer in tow.  
 Jessica watched this sequence intently. "My god. It's me!" she whispered
  with muted excitement, "and Debbie," she added with a glimmer of sadness, still
  not aware of her pony pair's fate.  
 Lucy appeared on the screen again. "Now let's take a quick tour of your
  cell. Your first order is that you should stay quiet. Noise will not be tolerated.
  See the ballgag and shackles hanging on a hook there? That's to remind you.
  You'll find yourself wearing them if you cause a disturbance."  
 Jessica looked warily at the red ball and its array of straps hanging decoratively
  on her cell wall. Next to the gag was a set of ankle shackles. They seemed
  to be taunting her.  
 "And if you're ball-gagged you can't eat! This brings me neatly to my next
  topic. Notice the two protruding tubes mounted on the wall? That's your feeding
  station. All you do in kneel down in front of them, and take them into your
  mouth until your chin and nose touch the sensors. That's when the food and
  water will be fed to you."  
 Protruding tubes? More like narrow, semi-erect penises, Jessica thought.
  The one for water was two inches long so would spray directly into the mouth.
  The food penis was much longer, measuring close to eight inches. Whatever this
  liquid food was, Jessica realized she wouldn't taste it. She was thirsty and
  eager to try the water, but Lucy's introductory talk continued:  
 "And alongside the feeding station is your toilet, the very latest innovation
  in female sanitary design. Kneel astride it allowing your weight to rest fully
  on it." Lucy demonstrated, sitting on the narrow curve of the stainless steel
  toilet until her sex was fully sealed within the banana shaped bowl. "And when
  you're done simply click the button on the wall with the sole of your foot...
  but stay seated! First, you'll be sprayed, then brushed, then hot air dried
  and finally perfumed. You'll find it's really very pleasant."  
 It had to be better than squatting over a hole, Jessica thought. The ponygirl
  quarters, and other slave areas were equipped only with floor level squatting
  toilets.  
 "If you've been wondering what that oval hole in the wall is... it's a face
  washer. Kneel down and push your face into the hole, resting your chin fully
  on the bottom ledge. There's a flexible tube protruding from the middle that
  you must take between your teeth, like sucking on a straw. Once the machine
  starts you'll be sprayed with warm water, and the tube will squirt an amount
  of mouthwash. You must swill it and spit it out while the cleaning progresses.
  Your face will be dried by warm air after the wash cycle...  
 "The final feature of your cell is called the slut-saddle  .
  You kneel in the saddle, nice and gently so this little dildo slips inside
  you. What could be nicer? Don't try using it yet or you'll receive a nasty
  electric shock. You're only allowed to sit on it at certain times. I'll see
  you later for exercises and to introduce your evening entertainment. Bye for
  now!"  
 "Bye-ee!" Jessica responded sarcastically in the same cheery tone, and then
  muttered, "They could at least provide knee pads for all this kneeling we have
  to do!"  
 She looked warily at the invitingly knobbly penis pointing skyward from
  the centre of the slut saddle, despising it, yet knowing what pleasure and
  comfort such a thing could give her. The cell had everything a prisoner needed
  to survive, and that's what worried her.  
 She knelt in front of the water penis and put her lips around it. The T-bar
  protrusion rising up through her tongue blocked off her palate, so she tucked
  it into her cheek like a hamster. As this tube was only two inches long, her
  nose and chin easily touched their respective sensors and Jessica was instantly
  rewarded with a steady trickle of cool water. The flow continued as long as
  she pressed her nose and chin against the wall sensors. She stared forlornly
  at the food penis knowing that the hated tongue-bar would not permit the tube
  to reach into her throat. She would have to stay hungry.  
 The rest of her new toys could wait. Her thirst quenched, Jessica lay on
  her bed and slept.  
EXERCISES  
 "In two minutes I'll be leading your afternoon exercises!"  
 Jessica woke with a start, disorientated by her surroundings, having been
  woken in a deep phase of sleep.  
 It was Lucy on the flat screen again. Jessica sat up, and slowly stood,
  her eyes still half-closed as she tried to get her bearings. It was the ideal
  time to try out the face washer; a splash of water on her face would surely
  do the trick. The unit functioned just as Lucy had described, leaving her face
  and mouth feeling clean and fresh.  
 Lucy was still in the buff except for her bunny chains, leading by example. "Now,
  stand in the middle of the floor and mirror my movements. First thing we have
  to do is roll the shoulders. Your arms are probably aching if you aren't used
  to bunny chains, but these exercises will help. Just keep rolling your shoulders.
  Now, legs straight and bend down to touch your toes."  
 "With what?" Jessica griped, but she diligently followed along Lucy's exercise
  program. She felt better for doing so. It wasn't so different from the routine
  she remembered from the bunny cabin, which they had devised themselves.  
 Then Lucy moved on to what she called ponygirl stretches  ,
  a routine based on the warm-up and stretching routine that Rabbit Island ponygirls
  always performed. It emphasised trunk, hips, thighs, and calves. Watching a
  pussygirl do this routine made Jessica laugh.  
 The exercise session ended after half an hour, with the screen going dark
  again. Jessica sat yoga-style on her rug trying to meditate, in the hope that
  it might relieve the boredom.  
 Somehow time passed and darkness fell. A light came on automatically, more
  for the closed-circuit camera's benefit than hers. Jessica was hungry, enough
  to attempt the feeding device, but it was impossible to get the plastic tube
  past the metalwork in her mouth. She looked up at the camera pointing down
  at her from the top corner of the cell. "I'm hungry," she said meekly, hoping
  that somebody was watching. Her plea was not answered.  
 There was a commotion outside the cell door. A young woman was struggling
  so hard that someone fell against her door as they passed. Jessica jumped at
  the sudden noise. The previous few hours had been as quiet as a monastery.  
 "Bastards. You fucking bastards!" The young woman shouted.  
 Jessica didn't recognise the voice, nor did she know who would waste her
  effort on such a futile struggle. The cell door slammed. Moments later there
  was more commotion as the woman banged her heels against her door.  
 "Fucking bastards! You can't keep me here like this!"  
 "Yes they can," said Jessica under her breath. It felt good to have a neighbour
  in the next cell, even a noisy one.  
 "You could at least take off these handcuffs!" The new prisoner shouted,
  her heel repeatedly banging against the door. Jessica admired her spirit, remembering
  how she used to be like that before the unrelenting regime of punishments and
  privileges put an end to such notions.  
 "And this collar! I'm not a dog, you know!"  
 "No, but like it or not, you are  a bunny." Jessica
  chuckled.  
 The complaining turned to begging. "Ohhh! Please guys. My arms are really
  aching now. I promise I'll be a good prisoner if you unlock me!"  
 When Jessica heard the neighbour's cell door open, she thought for a brief
  moment that the new girl had her wish. She should have known better. The two
  handlers who placed her in the cell minutes earlier had returned with their
  own ideas on how to stop the disturbance.  
 "No, please, no!" was the last thing Jessica heard before the ball-gag was
  lodged between her neighbour's teeth. Ankle shackles followed - closing around
  one ankle, then pulled back over her handcuffs and attached it to her other
  ankle. The men departed leaving her in a chained hog-tie, crying with self-pity
  on her small rug.  
 Although she couldn't see what was happening, Jessica could easily imagine
  the scene in the next cell. "Welcome to Rabbit Island!" she said, loud enough
  that the girl might hear.  
 Jessica paced the cell, thinking about her new neighbour, wondering whether
  she was getting herself worked up. With a little pressure on the right spot,
  (a crotch rope was ideal), and a little leverage to move her body, Jessica
  could easily bring herself to orgasm when she was hog-tied. She recalled the
  night when she was hog-tied and gagged on Master Alex's bedroom floor. He had
  another woman in his bed that night, and while he was making love to the woman,
  she rocked herself to an orgasm - and a noisy one at that - moments before
  Alex and the woman came. Jessica had always been an aural rather than a visual
  person, and the sounds of a man and a woman making love always excited her,
  not that she was in a position to explain that to Master Alex. He got out of
  the bed to pet her knowing that most women like a little caressing after they
  cum. "A hog-tie whore" he called her, compounding Jessica's embarrassment,
  then added "yep, I like that in a woman."  
 Jessica never forgot that incident or Master Alex's comment, and nor did
  he allow her to. Jessica found herself getting aroused while thinking back
  to that time and others with Master Alex, and the way he teased her in mind
  and body. Her ringed nipples were growing of their own accord, as if in search
  of a man to touch them, while her sex became increasingly moist and needy.
  She lay back on her bed and curled up facing the wall. Her chained hands vainly
  tried to reach over her hip, hoping for just the mere touch of a finger onto
  her clitoris. She gave up and settled for sweet dreams instead.  
 The screen came to life again, with the ubiquitous Lucy introducing the
  evening program. Jessica could hardly believe the luxury. She was watching
  television in bed!  
 Pussygirl Lucy gave instructions and an unnecessary but cute demonstration
  on how to use the slut-saddle  . After a brief pause the
  evening's movie started. It was, quite simply, a porn movie; one featuring
  many familiar places and faces from Rabbit Island and scenes from elsewhere,
  places Jessica didn't recognise. Kate appeared in a scene, then Rachel, and
  Lucy too, looking like a pre-Raphaelite porn star with her long blonde ringlets.
  Jessica lasted only five minutes in bed, becoming warmer, and increasingly
  agitated. She sat up in bed, twisted her hands to her side but still her fingertips
  were agonizingly short of her needy pussy. She began to wonder if preventing
  such behaviour was the main purpose of her bunny chains, with the security
  aspect merely the secondary effect. She knew that relief could only come via
  the slut saddle.  
 Jessica rose angrily from her bed, annoyed at having been forcibly aroused
  by the erotic images of the movie. She knelt down over the saddle's thick and
  deeply ridged phallus and slowly sank down on it until it stretched and filled
  her. For the next half-hour she bounced up and down on it, grinding her hips
  to create different movements as scenes of sexual torment and fulfillment flashed
  by. The slut-saddle  was well named, she conceded as she
  crawled exhausted into her bed.  
***  
 It was the sunlight, rather than any noise, that woke Jessica the following
  morning. Her arms ached and she cursed having to sleep with her hands locked
  behind her. Being chained together and to the top of the bed, ponygirl-style,
  was far preferable.  
 After extracting a long drink from the water tube, she gazed hungrily at
  the long feeding tube and thought how wonderful it would feel in her throat.
  She sat astride the high-tech steel toilet, gingerly allowing her weight to
  rest fully on it, her inner thighs pressed down on it, creating an effective
  join of skin and steel. Its reassuring coolness soon encouraged her to urinate
  and defecate.  
 Still seated, Jessica gulped nervously, closed her eyes, and then pushed
  her foot against the large push-button on the wall. The fine jets of water
  came up at her vagina and anus like a multitude of ice-cold pinpricks.  
 While the jets continued, a whining sound came as the rotary brushes started.
  She felt it burrowing deep within her crack and against her anus, brisk, insistent
  yet never harsh, leaving her with no doubt as to its efficiency.  
 The warm air dryer was altogether gentler, causing Jessica to go wide-eyed
  at the surprising pleasure.  
 A loud hiss beneath her and a mild stinging sensation to her labia signalled
  that she had been perfumed. Her toiletting complete, Jessica stood up, feeling
  clean and fragrant, and rather pleased with herself, like a kid that's just
  been potty-trained.  
 An hour later a handler came to escort Jessica from her cell. He blindfolded
  her, led her by the arm through the corridors of the cellblock and then outside.
  Jessica briefly sensed the bright daylight and felt the pleasant warmth of
  the sun on her head before they entered another building. Coolness and darkness
  returned, accompanied by a smooth, tiled floor beneath her bare feet.  
 Unseen hands helped Jessica onto a medical table and released her wrists
  their dangling handcuffs, but only so she could be fixed to the table, her
  hands attached to it by straps on each side. 'Bondage is relative' is an oft
  quoted saying on Rabbit Island, and Jessica, feeling her hands resting relaxed
  at her sides instead of pinned behind her, understood it well. Feeling her
  ankles being spread and similarly secured bothered her very little - there
  was something familiar and reassuring about the hands that controlled her.
  Her instincts were right - Dr Schmidt had left the preparations to Kate and
  Carol.  
 Jessica felt something wrapping tightly around her arm, constricting it.
  The blood pressure monitor was being set up. Then she felt a pungent rubbery
  smell against her mouth and nose, and something gassy. "Count backwards from
  ten to one," Doctor Schmidt instructed.  
 "Ten, n...."  
 The Doctor watched the heart monitor for a few moments. "We're ready, nurse
  Kate."  
 Kate lifted Jessica's blindfold, checked her pupil dilation and stroked
  her friend's forehead. The doctor fitted a metal dental gag between Jessica's
  teeth and forced her mouth open to such a degree that a conscious person would
  have found it intolerable. He poked around in Jessica's mouth with latex covered
  fingers, pushing against the rigid steel T-bar fixed behind her back teeth
  where her molars used to be. He studied the bar's upward piercing through her
  tongue, admiring not just the bondage it inflicted on Jessica's mouth but also
  the precision of the fitting, and almost feeling sorry to have to remove such
  an elegant construction.  
 He picked up a small drill from a neatly laid out tray of implements while
  Kate readied herself with the suction tube at Jessica's mouth. The removal
  operation, at once delicate and brutal, commenced.  
 While the T-bar extraction continued, Carol restored the six heavy-duty
  pony rings to Jessica's labial piercings. She was pleased to see Jessica's
  substantial nipples in excellent shape and still ringed. A good body piercer
  always feels a long-term responsibility for the piercings she makes.  
THE BELLS  
 Jessica barely remembered her visit to the surgery, and had only vague recollections
  of Kate and Doctor Schmidt. She slept in her cell for hours, eventually rising
  due to thirst. She licked her lips for the first time in two months. Her mouth
  hurt, bruised and sore from the severe opening of the dental gag and from the
  doctor's efforts in removing the T-bar. She looked down at her tingling sex
  and smiled upon seeing her restored piercings.  
 She was puzzled by the noise of a pleasant tinkling sound, like small bells,
  every time she moved. When she shook her chest the bells rung in response. "Bastards," she
  muttered with a wry smile. Standing up and leaning fully forward, she saw they
  had fitted small bells to her nipple rings. She shook her body again and laughed.
  It was as if a juvenile prank had been played on her, and not the first time
  she had thought that about her Rabbit Island masters.  
 Still restrained in her bunny chains Jessica knelt in front of the food
  and water dispensers. She cried out with pain when putting her mouth over the
  water dildo, pressing her chin and the tip of her nose against the pressure
  pads that released the water. The water in her belly reminded her of her hunger,
  as did the large protruding dildo to her left. Shifting over to it, she studied
  the slight downward curve of it, designed to make it easier to swallow. It
  was longer than the depth of her mouth by at least two inches.  
 "Sheesh, they don't make anything easy," she muttered, and gingerly took
  between her lips and let it slide in. Throating a penis was like swallowing
  a large pill - it's better to get it down first time. She pushed through her
  gagging reflex and moved her body upwards and forwards. The tube eased smoothly
  downwards into her throat until her nose and chin made contact with the sensors.  
 The feeding tube pulsed like a slow and strong heartbeat every couple of
  seconds. At first, she didn't think anything was happening, until she felt
  the pangs in her stomach begin to ease. Kneeling secured in her bunny chains
  and suckling at the mechanical feeder, Jessica felt like a helpless young animal,
  eager to gulp down whatever was provided by this grossly perverted variation
  of a mother's teat.  
 Sitting back on her bed, restored and fed, Jessica couldn't help but call
  out a genuine 'thank you' to the monitoring camera.  
 The arrangement of the cell was designed to remove any notion a new arrival
  had of her self-sufficiency. Everything coming in and out of her body was done
  for her and each fixture totally benign in purpose - feeding her, washing her,
  toileting her, and giving sexual pleasure and relief.  
 The day passed, and the next one too, by which time Jessica was talking
  to the equipment that maintained and nurtured her. Her only human contact were
  the faint noises beyond the cell door. Her noisy neighbour was now seldom to
  be heard, having become acquainted with the policy of rewards and punishments.  
 Jessica paced back and forth in her cell, a rat in a cage. Did rats get
  bored, she wondered. Her bunny chains were a kind of semi-bondage, leaving
  her neither free nor properly restrained, she felt in a kind of limbo. Prisoner
  purgatory. She became angry, trying to pull her arms apart and tugging on the
  chain connecting the cuffs to her collar as if after three days they would
  suddenly break open. Her frustration spilled out in a string of obscenities
  directed up at the monitor camera. Just in case they weren't watching, she
  turned her back to the cell door and thumped it repeatedly with her fists.  
 Room service promptly arrived. Two men walked in.  
 "I'm bored," Jessica grumpily informed them.  
 Their response was less than sympathetic. "Lay down on your rug," one of
  them growled. Jessica's hesitation was met with a sharp slap on her cheek;
  the officially approved chastisement for bunnies slow in following orders.
  Stunned by the sudden assault Jessica went down on her knees, collapsed to
  one side and positioned herself belly-down on the rug.  
 One man grabbed the ball-gag from its hook on the wall, while the other
  took care of the ankle shackles. Jessica cried out in pain as the red rubber
  ball was wedged between her teeth. Straps were buckled behind her head, another
  over her face, with a third buckled under her chin. Only then did she resume
  her complaining. It was a habit for many bunnies to be silent until they were
  gagged and then unleash a torrent of garbled saliva-dribbling abusive language,
  tolerated by the handlers purely because they were amused by it.  
 Simultaneously with her gagging, Jessica's ankles were shackled and joined
  to her wrists, hog-tying her. She rattled and rolled in her chains like a freshly
  captured wild beast, only making the handlers laugh at her. They decided her
  hog-tie should be stricter lest she did herself some damage. A thin leather
  cord was looped around her two big toes and threaded through the D ring at
  the top of ball-gag harness. The slack in the cord was pulled out and tied
  off, leaving Jessica with her neck bent back, facing ahead and unable to lower
  her chin to the floor. Another cord was used to draw her elbows together, eliciting
  more garbled complaints from Jessica. They rolled her onto her side, threaded
  a third cord through her nipple rings, then laced the two trailing ends through
  her labia rings, closing her labia like a shoe, then tied the cord off to her
  handcuffs. She was rolled back on her belly to experience the full erotic tug
  of the cords. If she wiggled her toes, her head pulled backwards. If she moved
  her hands, she felt a tug on her nipples.  
 Jessica wasn't likely to win 'best in show' at the hog-tie championships,
  but the combined effect of the chains and the leather cords made for a stringent
  binding, causing her to regret her earlier outburst. She continued to rage
  at the men, only causing them further amusement. One man left the cell, and
  returned a minute later holding two mugs of coffee.  
 They pulled her rug through a quarter turn so that she was facing them when
  they sat on her bed. "Ever played Name that Tune  , Jessica?"  
 "Ehhh!" She confirmed.  
 "The rules are simple. I whisper the name of a song in your ear and you
  have to sing it,"  
 Jessica looked at them incredulously. Most men just wanted to abuse her
  once they had her in such a helpless position, not play parlour games.  
 "And George has to say what the song is. If he fails to guess it, he is
  punished."  
 George almost choked on his coffee. "He's kidding with you Jessica. It's you  who
  is punished!"  
 Alan knelt down to Jessica's face and whispered in her ear: " I
      was bound to love you  !"  
 Jessica started to hum it, but was stopped by Alan. "You have to sing  the
  words. No humming!"  
 She started to 'sing'. They laughed, most surely at her rather than with
  her.  
 George didn't get that one, even after three repeats. Jessica wondered if
  he was deliberately failing to guess it, but there again she never could sing
  in tune. Alan fared no better with Jessica's rendition of Unchained
  Melody  . George couldn't even spot Please Release Me  .  
 Three more tunes followed. Only one the last did Alan guess correctly (The
      Star Spangled Banner  ), and only after Jessica had sung the
      whole thing. It left her in tears.  
 George and Alan thought it appropriate to end with the national anthem,
  and with Jessica on a winning streak. They left her alone, slamming the cell
  door callously behind them, and without a word on when she would be freed from
  their wicked hog-tie. Jessica began her long-awaited struggle - an animalistic
  instinct to fight against what has trapped it. Had she known how strict the
  bondage would be, and that she had to give a singing recital, she might never
  have engineered the situation she found herself in.  
 Jessica rocked her body back and forward on the rug, sensing rhythmic tugs
  on her nipples, her labia, her toes, and her hands. Fucking the carpet,  she'd
  heard it called. It proved mildly stimulating considering how little she was
  able to move her body.  
 As for the question of whether it passed the time and relieved her boredom
  - it did! With her pent-up orgasmic frustration, the aches and pains, the anger,
  the self-pity, the guilt, the shame of deliberately bringing this on herself,
  Jessica had much occupy her mind.  
THE PONY QUARTERS  
 The following morning Jessica had a visitor - Riccardo. She knelt on the
  floor in front of him, facing down at his feet. Her respect was genuine. She
  tried not to look too happy but seeing Riccardo, her pony driver, again it
  felt like a new beginning.  
 Riccardo held a clipboard and a pen and, after a brief greeting, started
  to ask Jessica some questions:  
 "The new bunny chains are more comfortable than the previous type. Strongly
  agree? Somewhat agree? No change? Somewhat disagree? Strongly disagree?"  
 Jessica's wrists pulled against the steel which had held her wrists behind
  her back for the last two days, and with some reluctance said: "Somewhat agree."  
 Riccardo asked similar questions about the automatic toilet, the phallic
  feeders, Lucy's exercise video, the slut saddle, and even asked about the softness
  of the mattress.  
 Jessica's brow furrowed as she began to find the questions as tedious as
  they were absurd. She always hated that style of multiple-choice. She needed
  to know something. "Riccardo, Sir. How is it my opinions matter all of a sudden?"  
 He gave a shrug. "It's research, to find out how the new initiation cells
  are functioning, and whether these home comforts help make the fresh arrivals
  easier to train."  
 Jessica sneered. "Home comforts? That's very funny! Boredom was my biggest
  problem."  
 "Ah! So that's what yesterday's tantrum was about?" Riccardo smiled. "I
  heard you had a little sing-song with Alan and George. Did the hog-tie they
  put you in help pass the time?"  
 "Actually, it did," said Jessica proudly. "At least it prevented me from
  kicking the walls of this impersonal automated cell."  
 "Better than a cold and dark dungeon!" Riccardo retorted, rebuking Jessica
  for her ingratitude.  
 "We never talked like this when I was your ponygirl, did we?" Jessica asked,
  gazing up at him and making direct eye contact.  
 "No we didn't," said Riccardo, smiling, and implicitly answering her implicit
  question. That was the moment she knew she was no longer under his whip. He
  was as considerate and fair as a pony driver could be. The thought of being
  under another man's whip scared her.  
 He helped her to stand and led her from the cell. Jessica was horrified
  that her nipple bells rang gently with every step. They walked out into the
  cobbled courtyard - the mustering point for all ponygirl activities. Two empty
  and detached pony traps stood in their usual parking places, ready to be hitched
  up. Jessica found the scene familiar and reassuring, even upon sighting the
  end-of-day whipping frame; all the signs of her past routine. Jessica was a
  creature of habit, and that was considered a good attribute for a ponygirl.  
 Riccardo opened the door to the ponygirl quarters. "After you!" he gestured
  with disarming courtesy. He unlocked her bunny chains and collar, leaving Jessica
  wearing nothing but her pony piercings as she walked into the newly decorated
  ponygirl quarters.  
 The main room, with its new arrived Scandinavian furnishings, was deserted.
  Jessica moved her aching arms about her in a slow windmill fashion trying to
  loosen up her shoulders while working through the pain. She heard laughter
  from the bedroom, and moments later three naked women emerged, screaming with
  delight. Debbie was the first to embrace her. Diana and Melinda soon made it
  an emotional group hug.  
 The rest of the day passed with barely a moment of silence as the four told
  their respective stories of the last few months in exile. The large pine table
  was piled with harnesses and ponyboots to be cleaned and repaired. As they
  worked, they talked; and as they polished and rubbed the leather so their nipple
  bells rang out almost constantly. To further add to the ringing cacophony Jessica
  had to fix bells to the backs of pony-boots, following their removal on La
  Plata.  
 The wall, with its gallery of ponygirl pictures had several new photographs,
  including Jessica as part of the four-team on La Plata. Debbie, Diana and Melinda
  were in turns appalled and enthralled by her tale of cruelty, punishment and
  subsequent rescue from La Plata. When asked about the bruising on her face
  she explained that Doctor Schmidt had caused it during the operation to remove
  her T-bit. Not for the first time, her roommates winced with horror as Jessica
  described her ordeal.  
 Debbie's experience on a remote Japanese island had been very different.
  After cajoling from Jessica, she reluctantly agreed to tell her story:  
 "I was what they called a pony-whore. That's why I'm always wearing corsets
  and stuff in the photographs. As you can see, they always made up my face to
  make me look as sexy as possible, bright red lips, rouged cheeks and dark eyeliner
  and shadows. I didn't mind that part, but I guess I looked a bit of a tart.
  We used to spend most of the day lined up, harnessed and attached to our one-man
  sulkies, waiting for customers. When a new client arrived, he could choose
  which of the five of us he wanted. Some of the pony-whores were shameless.
  If they liked the look of a man, they flaunted their bodies to tempt him. After
  a while I learned to smile and flaunt myself too, developing a sexy sway of
  the hips. It was better to appear happy and willing because some of the clients,
  particularly the cruel ones, preferred to take a sullen ponygirl as she was
  considered more deserving of punishment...  
 "Once a price was agreed - and mine increased a lot during my time there
  - the customer sat behind me on the sulky, sometimes receiving instructions
  on how to control me with the whip. In fact, the whipping was only for his
  amusement. I knew where I had to run. There was an area about five hundred
  metres away and uphill, so with the climb and the high humidity I was usually
  drenched in sweat when we arrived...  
 "The was a wooden hut, like a kiosk, at the top of the hill. The man who
  ran it ensured the customer had everything he needed, from condoms to whips
  to coca cola. After taking in the view from the hill, and exploring the equipment
  at his disposal, the customer would finally detach me from the shafts and fix
  me to one of the various frames. Usually I'd be put on a whipping frame first,
  just to get him in the mood. Then he'd fuck me - bent forward over an A frame
  was normal. Usually they left my tail plug in place, I guess they found it
  sexy to fuck a real ponygirl, but occasionally someone would remove it to use
  my ass. Some men would lay me straight down in the spread-eagle frame for a
  straightforward fuck. The fact that I was still a sweating and panting ponygirl
  seemed only to add to the attraction. I sure had lots of male noses pressed
  into my armpits. Apparently the diet they fed me, which is high in grain and
  fruit, was designed to make my sweat more fragrant than you might suppose."  
 Jessica laughed. "That would make a nice change! Did they let you bring
  some of that food back with you?"  
 "You're very funny, Jessica. Your handler must have needed a gas mask after
  you'd been wearing your leatherbody all day!" Debbie continued her story. "Usually
  we'd spend an hour in this hilltop 'sex place', as they romantically called
  it. After fucking me, the client would usually leave me tied down and get a
  cold drink or an ice cream from the kiosk. Alternatively, he might watch one
  of the other pony-whores getting treatment in the neighbouring sex place. After
  that short break, the clients were ready to go at me again...  
 "The worst part was being hitched up again for the journey back. Trotting
  downhill pulling along a guy that had just been fucking me was so..." Debbie
  paused to wipe a tear from her eye. "... so humiliating. I guess the men liked
  that part, the feeling of absolute power over a western woman who was several
  inches tall than them. I hated that part. Not even a cheap whore has to go
  through that."  
 Jessica was feeling strangely aroused by Debbie's tale until she saw the
  hurt flow out. They hugged, and for once Jessica was the comforter.  
 Diana and Melinda were lucky enough to have stayed together during their
  temporary exile from Rabbit Island.  
 "We were on a vast private estate and lived with other ponygirls and horses
  in a stable. Diana recalled. "The lawns were so well tended it makes the Rabbit
  Island lawns look like a municipal park. Of course, it took a lot of servants
  and slaves to keep it that way. Mostly we were used by the garden supervisor
  and hitched to a trailer that held garden tools. Perhaps our trailer would
  be loaded up with grass clipping or other waste. We weren't driven as such;
  we were just pulled along by our reins. You can see from the picture that the
  harnesses were well worn, designed for working not showing. It was just as
  well the harnesses were comfortable, as we usually had to sleep in them. All
  they did was release our hands from behind and chain them to the top of our
  beds. They weren't even real beds, just bails of hay with a blanket on top...  
 "Not all the ponygirls were like us. The lady of the estate had a pair of
  the prettiest ponygirls you ever saw - present company accepted! Both were
  tall, slim and blonde - from Sweden apparently. I must confess I envied them,
  strapped up in wonderful shiny harnesses and elaborate headstocks, while we
  were more like the gardener's donkeys. Yes. Donkey-girls!"  
 Jessica laughed. "Any donkey boys? Did you get laid?" she demanded to know.  
 Diana and Melinda had a glint in their eyes as they exchanged glances. "Not
  officially," they conceded, as if reluctant to share their secret. "We had
  to sleep side by side on our hay bed, with our hands chained to the wall by
  our heads, which they thought would keep us out of mischief. Let's just say
  we often found our legs entwined and our kisses not exactly chaste. Ever given
  someone an orgasm using your toes?"  
 Jessica shook her head. Melinda just blushed, being the  'someone'  in
  question.  
 Diana continued. "One night we were discovered to be not quite on our respective
  sides of the hay bales. It was one of the stable lads&hellip; of horses, not
  ponygirls! He was small and slim, like a jockey, but rather cute, we thought,
  with his slick black hair and soft dark eyes...  
 Instead of punishing or reporting us as we expected, he just stared, and
  I saw him adjusting the front of his pants. It was Melinda who encouraged him,
  and although he didn't understand English, he soon got the message from her
  body language. Suddenly I wasn't good enough for her!" She winked at Melinda.  
 "So the boy undressed and climbed onto the bed with us. Even in the darkness
  of the stable, we could see his cock was at full attention. It wasn't very
  thick but it was plenty long enough for the job. He seemed in awe, almost trembling
  as he put his palms on Melinda's breasts. I do believe his lost his virginity
  with Melinda that first night...  
 "The next night he came to us again. What can I say? The young boy was a
  gentleman. I could tell he wanted to fuck Melinda again but he took me instead,
  although I think I scared the life out of the poor boy when I wrapped my legs
  around him. He came to us most nights of the week from then on, never stayed
  more than half an hour and was always careful to clean up behind him. He kept
  us sane."  
 "One night, towards the end of our stay, he became too confident and fell
  asleep between us. I can tell you that we didn't object to having that warm
  young body wedged between us so we let him sleep. That's when they found him.
  He was dragged out of our stable by the supervisors, almost crying with terror.  
 "We didn't see him again until later that afternoon when we were returning
  to the stable. He'd been tied to a post with his hands high above him. They'd
  whipped his bare back enough to make it bleed. I thought he was unconscious,
  but as we went past him, pulling our usual gardening trailer, he opened his
  eyes and smiled, as if to say we were worth it!"  
 "Aw!" Debbie and Jessica said in unison, noticing that Diana and Melinda
  both seemed teary-eyed at the recollection.  
 They went to bed early, noticing the room contained eight beds as it did
  previously. The four vacant beds gave Jessica an empty feeling, a desperate
  desire to see Linda, Cathy, Sandra and Karita again. She hoped the four empty
  beds were a sign of their imminent arrival rather than a horrible reminder
  of their loss.  
 The handcuffs fixed by a chain to the top of the bed frame had been upgraded.
  These were thicker, absurdly so, but had soft rounded edges, unlike the previous
  police-issue versions. They had a green LED light built in, which flashed like
  a beacon every few seconds. The light would turn red once the cuffs were secured.  
 "It's nice to sleep in my own bed again," said Jessica to nobody in particular
  as she pulled a bed-sheet over her and locked the shiny new cuffs around her
  wrists.

BACK TO WORK   
 Everything kicked off the following morning when ponygirl duties recommenced.
  Jessica and Debbie made several trips between the jetty and the orchard, two
  kilometres each way. Previous resident bunnies returned with some new arrivals.
  At the quayside, her blinkered view and the martingale chain constantly frustrated
  Jessica, keeping her head from turning to take in the view. She had a mental
  checklist of people she hoped to see again: bunnies, ponygirls and, she had
  to admit, some of the masters too.  
 Frank, her new pony driver had ways to temper Jessica's excitement. His
  reputation as the strictest driver was well founded, demanding excellence  at
  all times from his ponygirls. Excellence, Jessica learned, was the stage beyond
  mere obedience for a ponygirl. She overheard Frank talking about it with somebody.
  He never talked to her, but she had the distinct impression that some of the
  conversation was for his ponygirls' ears too.  
 Chalk marks accumulated at an alarming rate on Jessica's and Debbie's thighs,
  each one for some minor misdemeanour, later to be translated into a swipe of
  the cane. Jessica had counted thirty marks at least - six groups of four vertical
  marks with a fifth diagonal strike through each set of four. While Frank was
  busying himself with unloading boxes at the orchard, Jessica bent forward and
  lifted her left thigh in order to gauge the extent of her upcoming punishment
  on the whipping frame. Frank spotted her, and rapped his horsewhip against
  her upper arm. For that alone he added two more chalk marks. He demanded, by
  means of a whip and a piece of chalk, that Jessica and Debbie stand motionless
  and bolt upright when not being driven.  
 Jessica might have complained about the tightness of the harness and the
  harsh strokes of Frank's whip, even before the end-of-day punishments, but
  being alongside Debbie compensated. They say that all ponygirl pairs feel it
  to some extent - an almost telepathic understanding and sympathy from their
  respective partners. The sense of purpose, the freedom from uncertainty, the
  elation of running fast as a team, the sheer physicality of it, made this the
  best day since Jessica had been back on the island.  
***  
 Several more days passed in the same fashion. There seemed an endless pile
  of supplies to deliver to various corners of the island. Rachel, Karen and
  all the other bunnies on the island had been seconded into carrying duties
  between the less remote parts. They wore their bunny chains - the regulation
  collar and handcuffs &ndash; and each wore backpacks and 'frontpacks' - not
  the sophisticated ergonomic designs favoured by trekkers, but improvised from
  nothing more than burlap sacks and thick rope.  
 Rachel and Karen were in a group of four, chained together by their collars
  at two metre intervals. They weren't happy with being chained pack animals,
  but the masters' gagging of persistent complainers had the desired effect.
  Each group had at least one ball-gagged member of the team as a reminder to
  the others.  
 At the rear of the chain gang was Karen wearing a single strap ball-gag,
  therefore losing her ability to join in with the conversation as they walked
  to the orchard for the third time that day.  
Rachel was at the front of the group, having the
  dubious privilege of leading the chain. She was responsible for motivating
  her gang to keep walking to reach their destination. Resting along the way
  was not an option - if they sat down, they might not be able to stand again
  with ten kilos of supplies in each of the two packs. There was simply no choice
  but to carry on walking. Rachel wished that a handler could have accompanied
  them, knowing that his whip would have motivated her companions far more than
  she could.  
 As Jessica was trotting along a trail, she spotted Rachel, notable for her
  white-blonde hair, even from a distance. Rachel and her chain gang instantly
  deferred to the approaching pony-trap, stepping off the track, standing in
  awe as the ponygirls passed them at what seemed an incredible speed, aided
  by a downhill gradient, an unladen trailer, and the regular application of
  the whipper. Jessica noticed a delicate wave of acknowledge from Rachel's cuffed
  hand.  
 At the jetty Jessica was pleased to see familiar faces disembarking from
  boats every day. The most welcome among them were ponygirls Linda and Karita,
  and she hoped they would be put straight to work. It was a testament to the
  integrity of Rabbit Island that they continued to resist the temptation to
  use motorised transport, but it placed a huge burden on the ponygirls and their
  drivers. Even Frank was beginning to complain about the workload, which, as
  he sat behind the ponygirls while they ran mile after mile, might have seemed
  rich indeed. In his defence, pony driving did require concentration, plus he
  had to load and unload the trailers at each end while Jessica and Debbie rested...
  upright and motionless, of course.  
 On their fifth morning of ponygirl duties they heard rumours about an evening
  party - a celebration of the reopening of Rabbit Island. Most of the ponygirls
  secretly wished they were going to the party; Jessica, by contrast, found herself
  caring little for it.  
 That morning Jessica and Debbie were standing in harness at the jetty again.
  Backed up for loading, it was impossible for them to see what or who was being
  unloaded. The blinkers might have kept Jessica's eyes on the road and limited
  her peripheral vision, but not her ears!  
 There's nothing a ponygirl likes doing more than eavesdropping, and Jessica
  and Debbie were hanging onto Frank's and Kurt's every word. The ponygirls thought
  the men sometimes forgot they were there, and for eavesdropping ponygirls that
  was good. Frank also had a habit of standing alongside Jessica casually squeezing
  her buttock with one hand as he talked. She liked that, and he knew it.  
 More slave girls were being led off the boat and, as usual, Jessica was
  intent on discovering who. Instead, it was men's voices that attracted her
  attention. Master Alex and Vince had returned.  
 Alex exchanged hearty greetings with Frank and Kurt, not afraid to give
  each other a manly back-slapping hug.  
 "How is everything?" Alex asked Kurt.  
 "Good! Rabbit Island is bigger and better."  
 "Bigger?" Alex teased.  
 "More guest rooms, more cells, more equipment, more bunnies!"  
 "Speaking of bunnies," Alex said, "here's my contribution."  
 They looked towards the Island fishing boat and ferry ,  watching
  as Vince sent them down the jetty as if it were a catwalk. "First we have Nancy,
  who I'm sure you remember."  
 "Ah. The prodigal daughter returns!" Kurt joked. Nancy 'mmmphed' something
  at him from behind her ball-gag, and it wasn't polite. "Same old Nancy we know
  and love!" He laughed and swiped her butt with his swagger stick as she walked
  past.  
 "And this is Nancy's best friend, Lina," said Alex.  
 The dusky skinned Lina walked naked and proud, her defiant expression only
  adding to her allure. Having a predilection for Asian and oriental women, Kurt
  was immediately struck by her, just as her butt was by his swagger stick. "Wow.
  Look at the way she walks," he said to Alex, noticing the gently sway of her
  shapely rump as she followed Nancy.  
 "And this is Janie."  
 Janie, collared and ball-gagged, walked tentatively down the jetty towards
  the men, her eyes glancing back and forth between Alex and Kurt, seeking reassurance
  from the former, and wary of the latter.  
 Kurt smiled kindly, noticing her nervousness. He was aware of her history,
  and her savage treatment at the hands of Madame Cavallo. "Welcome to Rabbit
  Island, Janie, where we know how to look after slaves properly."  
 She walked past him then stopped, waiting for him.  
 "You don't want to make the girl feel left out, do you?" Alex counselled
  Kurt quietly.  
Kurt duly planted a firm swipe of the swagger stick
  on Janie's rear, propelling her in the direction of her fellow slaves. He shook
  his head. "So this woman was the cause of all our trouble?"  
 "I suppose so," Alex confirmed, "although she's hardly to blame for Cavallo's
  barbarity and deviousness."  
 "She's better than I expected, quite..." Kurt fumbled over the correct word.  
 "Fuckable?" Alex teased.  
 "Yes, that's it. Fuckable. Pretty face, large breasts! I'm sure we can find
  things to do with her," said Kurt. He was very proud of his reputation as an
  imaginative tormentor.  
  
 "And finally we have Janie's friend, Mia."  
 The Thai woman walked down the jetty towards them, even more nervous than
  Janie.  
 "It's okay, Mia." Alex reassured her.  
 She wore a long ochre red cotton dress, tailored to her figure. Her hands
  weren't bound, nor was she collared.  
 Kurt was confused. "She's not a slave?"  
 "Not any more," Alex stated with obvious pride. "She's the wife of one of
  our gardeners, or rather she will be tomorrow. Then she'll work in the housekeeping
  department."  
 Mia gave Alex a hug, pressing her head against his ribs, as if listening
  for his heartbeat. She had found him to be a man who kept his word! Alex reciprocated
  her affection with an avuncular arm around her.  
 "I found her sitting in a cage in Charlie's slave depot. She'd been traded
  in, too old to sell to another whorehouse, and recovering from a drug addiction.
  When I commented that she was attractive, Charlie asked if I wanted her. No
  charge! But it was obvious she'd never pass the Rabbit Island audition on account
  of her age. Then I remembered Jos&eacute;, the gardener, needed a new wife.
  He told me he wanted someone 'obedient with smiling pretty face' .   So
  here she is! Do you think he'll like her?"  
 Kurt was puzzled. "They've not met before?"  
 "They'll meet tomorrow at the ceremony. They'll soon get to know each other
  as man and wife."  
 "That's crazy. Why do they have to get married?"  
 Alex shrugged. "Religion. Jos&eacute; doesn't believe in sex before marriage."  
 "In that case, he's sure chosen a crazy place to work!"  
 "Haven't we all?" said Alex with a sigh.  
 Being a free woman, Mia was spared a gratuitous swipe from Kurt's swagger
  stick as she walked by, joining those heading for the Lodge. She looked over
  her shoulder at Kurt, disappointed that he considered her unworthy of the stick.  
  
 Alex laughed. "Talking of crazy, here comes Charlie, the best slave trader
  in Thailand. He's come for a well-deserved holiday."  
 Kurt welcomed the Chinaman with a formal shake of hands. Alex put an arm
  around Charlie's shoulder and regaled him with suggestions of what he could
  do during his holiday. But Charlie was already distracted by something he'd
  seen: "Ponygirls!"  
 He walked purposefully to where Jessica and Debbie waited. Standing in front
  of them he had to crane his neck to look up at their impassive faces. "So tall,
  very beautiful, big muscles in legs!"  
 Alex gave the indulgent smile he reserved for all first-time viewers of
  ponygirls. Charlie was fascinated by the way the leather reins connected their
  ringed and belled nipples and their labia. "What this called?"  
 "Reins." Alex replied.  
 "And this?"  
 "Harness."  
 "And this?"  
 "Bridle."  
 Charlie's hands were firm but considerate as he explored the finer points
  of Jessica's sophisticated pony bondage. It was the kind of attention she liked.
  Only when rigged as a ponygirl was she ever treated with such respect and reverence.  
 "When we can ride on ponygirl?" Charlie asked eagerly.  
 "Tomorrow perhaps. They're busy making deliveries now."  
 "You like ride on ponygirl, Alex?"  
 Alex smirked, and heard Jessica give an involuntary snort. "Very much so.
  This one gives a very good ride. Come on Charlie, let me show you the Lodge
  now!"  
 For the rest of the day, Jessica had an extra spring in her step. So much
  so, that she and Debbie earned several chalk marks for running out of sync.
  Frank's severe caning on the punishment frame at the end of the working day
  brought her back to earth. With her ankles spread wide, and her torso bent
  forward over the A-frame Jessica was reminded of the price for not concentrating.
  Not for the first time her buttocks and the backs of her thighs were red and
  stinging. And, as usual, she vowed to be more obedient, more excellent  ,
  tomorrow.  
RUDE FOOD   
   With all the movement and activity going on as Rabbit
  Island as they prepared for its official reopening, Kate - in her role as the
  island's nurse - was constantly busy, attending to minor cuts and abrasions
  to handlers and bunnies-turned-pack-slaves. She enjoyed the work, and loved
  being useful. In truth she enjoyed being a nurse on Rabbit Island far more
  than she ever did in her previous nursing career.  
 She was in the main kitchen attending to yet another incident two hours
  before the dinner buffet was due to start. A kitchen porter had cut his finger
  and Kate was putting in a couple of stitches, whilst teasing the Filipino man
  about his low pain threshold. Nearby the French chef was ranting:  
 "Mon dieu! Regardez ces petits seins!" He pulled harshly on a bunny's nipples,
  demonstrating that her breasts were like those of an adolescent. "I cannot
  tie these! Get me another."  
 Kate had the misfortune to be sitting down in a direction that gave a sideways
  view to the chef. Beneath the bib of her nurse's apron, he observed she had
  just what he wanted. "You. Come here!" he gestured with the imperious wave
  of his hand.  
 Kate just at that moment finished dressing the Filipino's wound, so had
  no choice but to obey.  
 "Take off your dress!"  
 "I'm a nurse," Kate explained.  
 "You're a slave. Take off your dress."  
 Kate shrugged, untying the halter and releasing the tied bow at her waist.
  She stood in front of him wearing her white heels, stockings and garter belt.
  He grasped her full breasts in both hands and squeezed them, as if checking
  the ripeness of melons. "We use zis one! Take her away and clean her."  
 Two kitchen porters took Kate by the arms and led her into the kitchen's
  loading yard.  
 Ten minutes later a freshly scrubbed Kate returned to the kitchen, her skin
  tingling from the coarse brushes they'd used to scrape away her dead skin cells.
  She noticed a buffet table nearby. A woman had been stretched along its centre.
  She was covered in cold meats and other savoury items, although the shape of
  her prominent breasts could be seen beneath the sliced meat that covered them.
  Sticking out from between her legs was a large salami, which had been wedged
  into her sex. Nearby, a similar buffet table, not yet decorated, stood waiting
  for its human centrepiece. Kate panicked.  
 "Monsieur. Je suis une infirmi&egrave;re. Je dois retourner &agrave; la
  chirurgie!" she pleaded with the chef, hoping to resolve the misunderstanding
  in his own language.  
 "Non, mon cherie. You will be ze dessert course. Ouvrez votre bouche!" he
  commanded. Not even Kate's special reserve pout could save her. The chef pushed
  a whole tangerine into her open mouth, leaving her with a permanent expression
  of surprise.  
 The sous chef started on Kate's breast bondage, wrapping a thin twine around
  her body, above and below the breasts, then tucking the twine beneath the parallel
  lines, he circled Kate's breasts until they were tightly bound at the base
  to create two fleshy balls with unavoidably erect nipples atop them. Meanwhile
  the porters were brushing her whole body with gelatine. After fanning her dry
  they helped her onto the buffet table and tied her wrists with a coarse sisal
  rope. The chef tossed the porters a large banana. The kitchen became silent
  as Kate was fully penetrated by it, leaving the curved stem of the banana pointing
  forward and upward from her sex.  
 The bondage was simple: her tied hands were fixed to one end of the table,
  and her ankles crossed, tied and fixed to the other end. The art was in its
  tightness; they pulled so hard on her ankles that it was like a torture rack.
  Eventually, as Kate feared her shoulders might dislocate, they were satisfied
  with her immobility. The chef tugged on the banana's stem finding it firmly
  lodged in Kate's sex. Its prominence would inform anyone who cared to look
  of Kate's banana stuffing.  
 From there it was a formality, as the chef de partie arranged a sweet banquet
  on and around Kate's body. The swirl of strawberries and cream on her clean-shaven
  pubis was a work of art. The reason for creating such bulbous breast became
  alarmingly clear as the first sharp spikes dug into her flesh, just far enough
  to stay in. Kate counted at least twenty acupuncture piercings in each breast.
  The spikes were decorated with a colourful selection of small oriental fruits,
  leaving her breast flesh hidden beneath.  
 Kate would not only be denied the taste of her fragrant coating, but also
  the sight and sounds of those around her. They fitted her with opaque contact
  lenses and earplugs. Then her body was gently covered with a muslin cloth before
  being wheeled into the cold store to chill.  
THE GALLERY   
 The first night of the islands re-opening party was a casual affair compared
  to some of the highly choreographed events arranged on Rabbit Island. Tonight,
  the main event was to be the parade of the new and returning resident slaves
  after supper.  
 Masters and guests were mingling in the combined reception area and gallery.
  Two pussygirls in tightly laced white corset dresses offered a glass of champagne
  to each on their arrival. With their hair pinned up, lips red and inviting,
  and white chokers around their neck they provided visual aperitif equivalent
  to the champagne. Trays holding more than two-dozen glasses were fixed around
  their waists, with a supporting straps descending from the shoulders. Although
  each pussygirl had her wrists neatly bound behind her didn't seem to matter,
  they were well trained and confident enough to flirt and joke with the guests
  as they served.  
 There were two live exhibits in the gallery to amuse and distract the guests
  once they were armed with champagne.  
 Tonight Janie was the 'girl in a bottle,' or rather a gigantic bell jar,
  three feet in diameter and five foot in height. Nobody was fooled that she
  had somehow been squeezed through the two-inch wide neck, but the device was
  designed to give that illusion. Janie was naked, and wore nothing but her bunny
  collar (neatly engraved with her name.) A chain rising from the back of her
  collar rose through the top opening of the glass jar, fixed so that Janie was
  obliged to maintain her proud kneeling position.  
 Such attention might not have suited every slave but Janie revelled in it;
  an exhibitionist at heart. She was proud of her perky breasts, receiving many
  comments from her viewers, their words distant and hollow through the inch-thick
  glass that separated them. She often mouthed a 'thank you' upon hearing such
  a compliment. When one man gestured Janie should open her knees to better display
  her sex she didn't hesitate to do so. They exchanged smiles, communicating
  a mutual lust. The man immediately went to make enquiries on whether she was
  available for the night.  
 As the guests were interested in her, so Janie was interested in them, and
  the panoramic view from her jar as people swirled past and around her. To her
  left was the lobby's other live exhibit: Nancy, Janie's fellow cage dweller
  from Charlie's slave depot.  
Actually, Nancy made up only half of the exhibit;
  the other part was a Greek statue of impressive physique, made of fake marble.
  Nancy knelt naked in front of 'Apollo', her wrists and ankles bound and connected
  with thick white rope - a sitting hog-tie. Her skinny body and heavily tanned
  skin contrasted strikingly with the statue's pure white muscularity. She was
  intimately connected to the statue - her mouth around his semi-erect cock.
  (Apollo suffered the indignity of a detachable penis, so that an appropriate
  tool could be employed for different scenarios.)  
 Nancy's lower lip sported a deep piercing thanks to an unfortunate experience
  with the forest tribe during her unsuccessful escape attempt; thus was she
  ideally suited to be Apollo's first partner. A short length of fishing line
  had been looped and tied through Nancy's lip, reopening the wound, and then
  threaded through a hole between Apollo's testicles and tied off inconspicuously
  behind them. She couldn't pull away from the impressive girth of the statue's
  member without tearing her lip. Most casual observers assumed it was only her
  perseverance and obedience that kept her pleasuring the statue. Only those
  who had bent down to examine her closely could see exactly why and how she
  was so attached to it.  
 Being displayed in such a compromising position was the last thing Nancy
  wanted. She was well known as the recaptured escapee, and considered by many
  to have contributed to Rabbit Island's recent closure. One man, a particularly
  odious Island committee member (and perennial opponent of Master Alex), seemed
  intent on discussing a few matters with her:  
 "It's good to have you back, bunny!" He sneered. Nancy gave him a sideways
  glance, before concentrating again on the delicately carved pubic hair in front
  of her eyes. "Your stunt cost this island dearly. We closed the whole place
  down just in case you contacted certain authorities. I voted against closing
  because I knew a dumb bitch like you would either be killed or captured. And
  here you are, back where you belong."  
 "No I don't!" Nancy attempted to say.  
 "Oh I ho?" he mocked. He enjoyed Nancy's discomfort, her bound hands twisting
  and turning in the rope confinement. "How does it taste? You'd better get used
  to it. Apollo will be a regular partner from now on. Have you heard what your
  sentence is?"  
 Nancy shook her head to the tiny extent her mouth bondage allowed her.  
 "Six months without any human sexual contact. No men, no slaves, nobody.
  That's right! Your lovers will be statues and machines, and I'll personally
  ensure that any pleasure you receive will be far outweighed by pain. And when
  your six-month sentence is over, mine will be the first cock you taste, although
  you'll feel it rammed up your ass before you taste it! Yes, I've already booked
  you!"  
 He savoured Nancy's helpless squirming, a victor gloating over his defeated
  and enslaved enemy.  
 "You're probably thinking that because you're tied that way, we can't whip
  you tonight, but you're wrong. The soles of your feet make a fine target. I've
  never known a slave yet who enjoyed having her feet caned." He departed with
  a sneer, reserving a glance of disgust for Janie in the jar as he passed her.  
 Pussygirl Lucy passed by, wiped away Nancy's tears and gave a comforting
  stroke of her hair. As if the man's taunts weren't bad enough Nancy waited
  fearfully for his return with the cane. He feet were already tingling in dreadful
  anticipation.  
 The gallery became quiet when the buffet dinner was being served in the
  ballroom. Feeling very alone, Nancy cast her eyes up at the statue, admiring
  his sculpted abdominal muscles, broad chest and classically handsome face.
  She imagined for a moment that he was real and soon found herself becoming
  moist with arousal at such a prospect. No Rabbit Island man could match his
  physique. For a fleeting moment she imagined his cock was becoming erect and
  found herself working it with her mouth. At least he wouldn't hurt her. She
  bit down hard on his white rubber-coated member, and sobbed quietly.  
JUST DESSERTS   
 The buffet tables were wheeled into the ballroom and greeted with appreciative
  but polite applause. Kate, as the dessert course, was left as an erotic display
  while the meat buffet table was attacked with fingers and prodding forks. The
  opaque contact lenses kept Kate in the dark, but her earplugs allowed just
  enough sound for her to know she was in the midst of the party. Thankfully,
  the ballroom was considerably warmer than the chill room. Her body, stretched
  out for so long, was aching, her bound wrists and ankles deeply indented by
  ropes that were not merely binding her but stretching her to her limit. Kate's
  only consolation was that she'd be released when dinner was over. She braced
  herself for the assault to come, her vaginal muscles bearing down on the banana,
  as if to find comfort in it.  
 At Master Alex's table were Ranulph Markham, his companion slave Linsey,
  Charlie the slave trader, bunny Rachel and Vince. After their recent adventures,
  Vince had unofficially taken the role of Alex's sidekick and bodyguard, or henchman,  as
  Alex liked to call him, joking that he'd always wanted a henchman of his own.  
 For the first time in more than a year, Rachel wore real clothes, including
  a glamorous little black dress  , which fully exposed
  her shoulders and drew attention to the black felt choker around her delicate
  neck. Her wrists were secured behind her with clear plastic straps, almost
  invisible if you weren't looking for them. They were attached to a belt hidden
  beneath her dress. Rachel discovered the dubious pleasure of being securely
  bound even when you look free.  
 Sitting at a table with masters was partly a reward and partly a test for
  Rachel; they were evaluating her suitability to become a pussygirl. She already
  possessed two important attributes, being blonde and pretty, but she was struggling
  with another - a smiling disposition. Even when happy she appeared cool, laconic
  and quiet, and tonight she was in a sullen mood. Ranulph Markham finally guessed
  it, reaching across the table to gently touch her arm. "You're missing Cormack,
  aren't you?"  
 Rachel nodded, her eyes welling with tears. Sitting at a table with Alex,
  Markham and Linsey had filled her with a longing to see his bodyguard Cormack
  again. She blamed Markham for sending him back to London. Then Markham said, "I'm
  sure you'll see him again," emphasising the word 'sure'. Rachel's mood changed
  instantly, sitting proudly upright and sticking out her chest so much that
  her oversized breasts were in danger of falling out of the dress.  
 Alex returned to the table with his dinner plate, and news of Kate. "You'll
  find her when you go for dessert!" he sighed to his dining companions, clearly
  very annoyed.  
 He released Rachel's hands from their straps so she could eat. She smiled
  gratefully. Her sense of newfound privilege had obliterated any thought of
  being a prisoner, a sexual slave on this island. In such matters timing was
  everything, and Alex had decided it was Rachel's time. For the last year she
  had been moulded by the Rabbit Island methods of punishment and reward.  
 Vince escorted Rachel and Linsey to the dessert table, where they encountered
  Kate, laying tied and stretched along the table, her body surrounded and covered
  with desserts and cheeses. She was blinking, but when Rachel touched her hair
  and spoke, she saw a blank expression and vacant unfocussed eyes. "She's wearing
  blind contacts, and her ears are plugged too," Vince happily explained. "She
  sure is a dish, isn't she?"  
 Rachel's eyes were agog at the delicious spread before her, the aroma of
  chocolate sauce invading her senses. She loaded her plate to capacity with
  chocolate gateau and exotic fruit salad. "Poor Kate. She'd kill to taste food
  like this," she said wistfully.  
  
 "Looks like she has a tangerine to keep her going," Vince joked, referring
  to the fruit still acting as Kate's gag.  
 Meanwhile at the table, Alex muttered to Markham: "They should be taking
  better care of Kate in her current condition."  
 "Condition? What condition? Say what you mean, Alex!"  
 "She has a bun in the oven, I believe you say it on your side of the pond."  
 Markham smiled, defusing Alex's grave countenance. "That's a relief. I thought
  you meant she was sick. She looks as fit and healthy as any woman I've ever
  met. Stop worrying, Alex! This is an evening for celebration. Enjoy yourself!"  
 Vince, Rachel and Linsey returned to the table, cutting short Alex's and
  Markham's discussion. Linsey sat down and stared guiltily at her overflowing
  plate, having been led astray by Rachel's enthusiasm.  
 Markham noticed. He couldn't fail to. "You're a greedy slave," he scolded
  his companion slave. "You will eat it all, and tomorrow you'll spend three
  hours on the treadmill!"  
 Alex had an idea. "What about a day of ponygirl training instead? That'll
  burn off those calories."  
 Markham readily agreed, and Rachel, filling her mouth with tiramisu, was
  roped in to partner her. She was relieved when Vince fixed her hands behind
  her again, having managed to get in trouble within only fifteen minutes of
  freedom.  
 After dessert, the ballroom's lights dimmed for the parade of
      slaves  .  
 Each naked slave was led in at intervals of a minute before the next slave
  arrived. They were led in at one minute intervals, handlers controlling each
  by a leash fixed to her collar ensuring that they circulated around the tables
  for the closer scrutiny and pleasure of the party guests. The bunnies had been
  warned in advance that the sullen and uncooperative among them would be participating
  in the subsequent caning competitions. That threat seemed to put a smile on
  a bunny's face, even if merely a ploy to save herself from punishment.  
 Their artificial smiles didn't extend to Rachel; until recently one of their
  number. She received only the bitter scowl reserved for traitors. When you're
  dining at a master's table, and filling your mouth with tiramisu, you're liable
  to lose the respect of your fellow bunnies. It hurt, but Rachel knew there
  was no turning back. Spending week after week in La Plata's breeding shed with
  Kate chained at her side had forged a special friendship and a respect, and
  the journey back to Rabbit Island on board the Slave to Fortune  ,
  had sealed it: There was more to life than being a bunny, even on Rabbit Island!  
 After the parade of slaves  , the new arrivals were
  taken straight back to their orientation cells - one of which Jessica had tested
  a few days ago. They would stay there for at least a week while a series of
  health checks and mental assessments were performed. Meanwhile, it was open
  season on the established bunnies. If they were lucky they would find themselves
  in somebody's bedroom, and if they were unlucky they would be on the receiving
  end of a punishment session. A few of them saw it the other way.  
 When the music started in the ballroom, Markham took Linsey onto the dance
  floor. Much to her surprise Rachel was gallantly invited to dance by Vince.  
 Master Alex went outside to take some air. He approached the waiting ponygirls.  
 They were a foursome; hitched to a four-seat carriage, ready to take people
  back to the newly constructed lodge extension three hundred yards away. Whenever
  the Island had an evening event ponygirls were always on hand should anybody
  demand transportation. It was equally a decorative role, something to admire
  and talk about for those who'd walked out of the Lodge for fresh air or a smoke.
  Fresh air was only part of Master Alex's reason for being there.  
 The two ponies at the front of the foursome were Debbie and Jessica. Behind
  were Melinda and Diana. Alex admired the poise of the ponygirls, standing stock-still
  in their tight leather harnesses as if they had been born to it. For those
  with an appreciation of such things, these ponygirls weren't merely women,
  but were objects of erotic beauty, and works of art. To some men they were
  a potent symbol of the superiority of men and the subservience of women.  
 Alex stood face to face with ponygirl Jessica. She avoided eye contact but
  glanced up and down his body, noticing his dinner jacket and bow tie. In her
  own way, she was also formally dressed, wearing an ostrich plumed headdress,
  her lips and eyes made up and her skin oiled and glittered. Everything about
  her seemed to glisten in the moonlight. The word that came to mind was perfection  .
  He hooked his fingers beneath the reins descending from her nipple rings to
  her labia rings, and tugged gently. Jessica's nipple bells rung, and Alex finally
  sensed a reaction from her.  
 "You like it when I ring your bells, don't you?" he said forcing her to
  make eye contact, and inviting her to accept the double meaning. She didn't
  respond, but he noted the way the leather bit resettled itself between her
  fine white teeth. She was certainly listening.  
 While many visitors might crudely tweak and pull a ponygirl's nipples, nothing
  affected Jessica like somebody running their fingers gently between her flesh
  and the leather harness, and Master Alex did it with an intense reverence that
  caused Jessica to tremble. And it wasn't just her that reacted. Alex's penis
  stiffened.  
 "Hello Master Alex!" Riccardo said as he stepped out of the shadows.  
 Alex quickly gathered himself. "Riccardo. Just the person I was hoping to
  see."  
 "Me? Why?"  
 Alex put an arm around Riccardo's shoulder and led him into the darkness,
  away from the notoriously nosy ponygirls.  
 "It concerns Kate."  
 "Oh?"  
 "She's pregnant."  
 "I see. She was in La Plata's breeding shed so I'm not surprised. What about
  Rachel? She was also in the Breeding shed."  
 "She's all clear. It's only Kate we have a problem with. The committee will
  make a decision tomorrow at noon."  
 "Decision?"  
 "We don't allow juveniles or children on the island. She will either have
  an abortion, or will be sold, quite possibly back to La Plata."  
 "La Plata? That's crazy. She was responsible for Madame Cavallo's amputation
  and was about to be executed when you arrived." Riccardo turned away, facing
  into the darkness. "Alex, surely you can't allow her to be sent back there."  
 "It's out of my hands. I don't run this place any more, in fact I'm not
  sure I have any influence whatsoever."  
 "Thanks." Riccardo faltered. "Thanks for telling me."  
 "I felt I should. It seemed only right... because according to Cavallo's
  meticulous records, you are the father."  
 Riccardo stared into the darkness, his hand reached up to his eyes as if
  to wipe a sudden tear. He took a deep breath. "If I am the father as you say,
  and if I have a choice, I will not allow an abortion. My beliefs won't allow
  it."  
 It was exactly what Alex feared Riccardo would say. "In that case Kate will
  have to leave the island. Please think about what is best for her." He patted
  Riccardo on the shoulder and wandered back into the Lodge, not even glancing
  at the ponygirls as he passed.  
 Had he done so, he would have seen a rare sight: A ponygirl's tears.

THE SURGERY  
Kate was untied from the dessert trolley, vowing never to eat a tangerine
  again, having been gagged with one for the previous three hours. She was permitted
  to eat the scraps of food left on table and her own body. Such was her hunger
  she wasn't squeamish about eating the banana which had nestled inside her vagina
  all evening. After being hosed and scrubbed down in the kitchen's back yard
  she was permitted to dress and make her weary return to the surgery.  
Doctor Schmidt treated the lacerations around Kate's wrists and ankles, as
  well as the deep indentations the breast bondage inflicted upon her. He did
  nothing about the pinprick marks scattered over her breasts, deciding they
  would heal just fine.  
He wasn't particularly sympathetic towards his nurse. "Shall I tell you about
  real suffering?" he asked her, not for the first time. And Kate, as on those
  previous times, declined his offer and ceased her complaining. The doctor dressed
  her wrists and ankles in bandages and surgical tape, more than would normally
  be necessary for such injuries, but not all his patients had to sleep in chains.  
They had an unwavering nightly routine. At the doctor's command, Kate laid
  down on a cushioned mat, which she had earlier removed from a cupboard and
  unrolled into one corner of the surgery. A set of four chains were draped ready,
  each fixed to the same metal ring in the wall six inches above the floor. The
  doctor watched as Kate secured her own ankles and then her wrists into their
  respective metal cuffs. It left her wrists chained loosely behind her back,
  ensuring first that she wasn't free to wander, and second, that she would not
  touch herself in the night. Kate pulled her pillow into position with her teeth,
  and laid the side of her head on in.  
The second part of their routine came later, when the doctor covered her
  with a sheet immediately before turning off the surgery lights. This simple
  act was the only tenderness he ever showed her. After covering her, he stroked
  her tenderly, a touch too intimate to be parental but not sensuous enough to
  be that of a lover. It was, Kate began to think, how someone strokes a much-loved
  pet dog. Invariable she closed her eyes as the doctor petted her, his touch
  affirming her place and her value as his nurse. She'd be deeply unsettled if
  ever he failed to provide this simple comfort.  
THE ROTATING EXERCISER  
Ranulph Markham was a man of his word, which may be good news or bad, depending
  on what he had promised.  
For Rachel and Linsey it meant being dragged from their beds at six o'clock,
  with not a hint of dawn in the sky. Bruce, who's own ponygirls were on the
  late shift - not starting until midday - had volunteered to put them through
  their paces.  
Rachel and Linsey were firm friends after their time together on the Slave
  to Fortune, and even as Ranulph Markham informed them of their punishment for
  gluttony at the dessert table they shared a smile. Like many slave girls, they
  were curious to discover first-hand what being a ponygirl was really like.
  All that intimate harnessing, the elegance and poise, the discipline, the training,
  and the firm way the drivers handled them. It looked easy enough, particularly
  watching the likes of Jessica and Debbie going through their paces.  
They were still smiling, even after Bruce had brought them into the chilly
  pre-dawn air, and harnessed and bridled them. They revelled in the leathery
  caress of the practical harnessing, biting and chewing on the real rubber-covered
  bits between their teeth.  
The fun didn't last. They weren't allowed to wear the heel-less pony boots
  as they'd hoped. Normal running shoes would suffice. And instead of being harnessed
  side-by-side in front of a cart, Bruce led them into the corral, the grassy
  fenced-off area beyond the main lawn. There wasn't a cart for them in the corral
  either, only the rotating exerciser, the merciless device used to train new
  and unfit ponygirls.  
The 'rotor' as the drivers called it, consisted of a central vertical pole,
  which rotated at its base, and radiating from the top of the pole, two rigid,
  braced arms, 15 metres in length and 6 feet above the ground. Bruce fixed Rachel
  to the end of one arm, clipping the dangling cables to the securing points
  on the back of her harness. Linsey received the same treatment on the opposite
  side, 30 metres away.  
Bruce wielded his horse whip, beating Rachel's thighs and calves until she
  made some satisfactory high steps. He walked around the circuit with her, obliging
  Linsey to walk at the same pace on the opposite end of the metal arm.  
Then Bruce stood and waited for Linsey to arrive. Her ungainly attempts at
  pony stepping had him tutting and shaking his head before she was even close
  to him. She endured the lashing of his whip and his tongue as he taught her
  the basic ponygirl steps. She hadn't been yelled at like that since the days
  of the school hockey team.  
"Get those knees up, you lazy slut. C'mon, work those thighs. Move it! Your
  master has been spoiling you. If you don't get in shape he'll probably sell
  you to a pig farm." His whip landed hard on her haunches, reminding Linsey
  that this wasn't a game. If Bruce's aim was to make her cry, he'd succeeded.  
After a few laps of near constant whipping, Linsey settled in a acceptable
  trot. Like a donkey rather than a pony, Bruce commented. She found it hard
  going, and bitterly regretted her greed at the dessert table. Bruce left her
  to complete the circuit on her own, alone but for the distant vibrations of
  Rachel being transmitted across the thirty metre span of rotor.  
On the rotor's central pole Bruce set the counter mechanism to 100. With
  a strike of his whip against Rachel's rump he sent them on their way: 100 laps
  of a 100-metre circumference equalled 10,000 metres. Approximately 6 miles.  
The two ponygirl tourists continued to plough their circular furrow in the
  morning gloom. Bruce had gone for a coffee leaving the lap counting to the
  counting device.  
The Lodge was just a dark outline against the sky a hundred yards away, going
  in and out of the ponygirls' view in the course of each circuit. While most
  of the island's population of masters and slaves continued to sleep soundly
  in their beds, Rachel and Linsey trotted in lonely isolation.  
They learnt the hard way that they needed to work together, to run at a pace
  both could maintain without causing the rotor to jolt and unbalance them. It
  was easier said than done when your partner was thirty yards away, on the opposite
  end of the huge rotating arm. Ponygirl life was proving a big disappointment.  
A half-hour later Bruce returned, far from pleased by their lack of progress.
  He had a sure-fire way to get them running faster, swiping their butts with
  his whip each time they passed him. They quickly learnt that the faster they
  ran past him, the more difficult it was for Bruce to land a solid hit on their
  rumps. He laughed at the look of terror in their eyes each time they approached,
  seeing his whip ready and poised to strike.  
There was however, one positive moment. Running the last few dozen laps,
  these novice ponygirls experienced a mesmerising and unforgettable sunrise.  
THE COMMITTEE  
Kate slept well that night, appreciating that the doctor's bandages had cushioned
  her chaffed wrists from their steel bracelets. She always rose after the doctor,
  due to his holding the keys to her sleeping chains.  
After she had made his toast and milky coffee, Kate commenced her work cleaning
  the surgery. Every morning she spent two hours scrubbing floors, wiping surfaces
  and carrying out other periodic tasks, in order to maintain the surgery as
  she liked it. This morning the doctor seemed engrossed with a textbook, and
  writing out notes, coughing and mumbling to himself as he did so. Kate crawled
  naked on her hands and knees as she wiped the floor around and under him. Dr
  Schmidt never said anything to her, but how could he not enjoy having an attractive
  naked young woman happily scrubbing the floor around him every morning?  
The phone rang.  
As the doctor listened to the caller, Kate could sense by his telltale glance
  that it concerned her.  
He put down the receiver. "You must go to the committee room in half an hour," the
  doctor said in his typically neutral tone.  
Kate finished up her cleaning, took a shower, made up and dressed in her
  white stockings and suspenders, and skimpy white apron. Finally she pinned
  a clean nurse's cap in her short blonde hair. She came out of the bathroom
  and turned her back to the doctor to allow him to tie the apron strings at
  her neck and waist.  
"Hands," he said. She crossed her wrists behind her to await their binding.
  He wrapped and tied a latex tourniquet tube around her wrists, holding them
  tightly in the small of her back. Thus bound, she was properly presented for
  her interview with the committee members.  
Kate walked across the courtyard and entered the Lodge on her own, finding
  Erik waiting for her in reception. His half-hearted smile had a subtext of
  pity that she found disconcerting. He asked her to wait until summoned. "Talk
  to Nancy," he suggested.  
Nancy could not talk back. She was held in a strictly roped hog-tie in the
  centre of a low platform. The black straps and a bright red ball of her ballgag
  harness complemented the immaculate white ropes perfectly. This was part of
  her six months of punishment: a real-life bondage artwork, an erotic talking
  point for people passing through reception.  
The edges of Nancy's platform functioned as seating for people passing through
  the reception area. Kate sat down at Nancy's side gripping her arm with her
  own bound hands, unsure whether she was giving or seeking reassurance.  
After ten minutes sitting in tense silence, the committee room door opened
  and Erik ushered Kate inside.  
Five men sat behind long desk facing her, including Master Alex sat at one
  end, as if he had become a peripheral figure. Kate was invited to kneel on
  the floor in the middle of the room.  
"Do you know why you are here?" The Chairman, seated in the centre asked.  
She swallowed, and said meekly, "Yes, I do."  
"Then you know that this situation will not be allowed to continue."  
Kate nodded and hung her head.  
"You will be allowed to stay on Rabbit Island while your details are circulated
  to other slave owners, in the hope of a reasonable offer. Priority will be
  given to those who are experienced in handling childbirth and its resulting
  transactions. It is highly likely that you will be sent back to La Plata, where
  the child was conceived. I believe that Madame Cavallo is very eager to have
  you back in her breeding stock, and has already made an offer. Another offer
  is also in preparation, but I doubt it will exceed hers."  
"Could I stay on Rabbit Island if I had a termination?" Kate asked.  
"Terminating your pregnancy is not an option; rather it's your current role
  as a nurse which will be terminated. Erik will escort you to the induction
  cells where you will stay until the sale is concluded." He pressed a speaker
  button on the desk. "Erik? You may take her to the cells now."  
Kate glanced up at Master Alex, hoping he might say something. He wasn't
  smiling, but nor was he impassive. He seemed uncomfortable; not meeting her
  eyes, and tapping his pencil lightly on a notepad.  
While Erik was escorting her to the cells, their paths crossed with Riccardo's.
  Kate rushed to him pressing her body against his. She felt his arms fold lightly
  around her, and yearned to do the same to him.  
"They're selling me, Riccardo." Kate sobbed. "I didn't want to get pregnant.
  I had no choice. I tried to resist, really I did! I don't want to go away from
  here."  
"You'll be fine," Riccardo casually consoled her. He wasn't as upset by her
  news as Kate expected and hoped he would be. He kissed her briefly on the forehead
  and walked off, saying he had a meeting to attend.  
Erik pushed Kate into the cell, coincidentally the same one Jessica had occupied.
  He untied her hands and made her strip. Kate cried, not for her imminent nudity,
  nor that her bunny chains were laid on the bed waiting to claim her again,
  but that her nurse's uniform, and all it signified, was being taken from her.
  She was scarcely aware of Erik encircling her neck with the leather collar.
  He snicked the padlock closed under her chin and spun her around to fix her
  wrists in the cuffs dangling behind her.  
He'd seen many slaves falling apart as they realised the hopelessness of
  the situation, but never Kate. Not until now. Finally, she was broken.  
* * *  
"I need more time."  
The chairman laughed. "And supposing you manage to raise the money. Then
  what? She's a slave. There are security issues to consider. You can't return
  her back to normal life. If she doesn't betray you, she'll betray the people
  of Rabbit Island. We can't allow that to happen."  
Riccardo was ready for that line of argument. "I'm negotiating with someone
  who can provide the security."  
The chairman tried a more sympathetic approach. "Riccardo. Are you sure you
  are doing the right thing? Spending your whole life savings on a slave? It's
  even more expensive to keep a slave than a wife with a shoe fetish. Believe
  me, I've done both."  
Others at the table laughed politely. Riccardo didn't, and nor did Alex.  
Riccardo waited for the smile to drop from the chairman's face. "Sir, if
  I place the highest offer, and meet the security conditions, then can I have
  her?"  
The chairman shrugged. "Yes."  
"That's all I need to know. Good day, gentlemen!"  
Riccardo made his exit without further comment, leaving the committee bemused,
  but not impressed. They'd seen it all before.  
"You can love a slave, but you can't be a slave to love," the Chairman commented,
  glancing imperiously at the men on either side of him. The others, including
  Master Alex this time, mumbled their agreement.  
ALEX'S SECRET  
Ranulph Markham took a coffee and bacon roll outside, and walked towards
  the corral to check on the progress of his companion slave. He was just in
  time to watch the last five laps. When the hundred laps were completed the
  rotor automatically locked to prevent further rotations. Bruce noticed Markham's
  disappointment and went to the central pole of the rotor to add ten more laps.  
"It must have jammed!" Bruce joked as he whipped Linsey's backside to get
  her running again. He walked over to Markham to continue the conversation,
  leaning on the opposite side of the corral's wooden fence.  
"Great job, Bruce. I do believe this'll do Linsey some good," Markham commented.
  Watching his near-constant companion, running lap after lap in nothing but
  a harness and a film of perspiration was arousing him. "What happens next?"  
"It's break time. I'll give them water, and a couple of sugar lumps, ten
  minutes to recover, then I'll fix them to weighted sulkies for some strength
  work. If you come back later, and she has performed well, you can take her
  for a ride."  
Markham laughed. "Now there's an offer!"  
He took his leave from the corral and headed for Master Alex's office, where
  a satellite internet connection enabled him to keep abreast of business affairs
  in London.  
Alex returned to his office, explaining the unfolding events of the committee
  room to Markham. The wealthy Englishman had taken a liking to Riccardo and
  the cute blonde slave, whose family home, he discovered, was only twenty miles
  from his Hampshire estate.  
"My friend, by rights she should be returned to La Plata. She's carrying
  a baby that was bred to exact specifications, a Mediterranean man and a blonde
  woman. These children all go to happy loving homes of people who can afford
  to give them every advantage in life."  
Alex gave a sigh. "If they could only see how that child was conceived!"  
"That's not the point. Who are we to make moral judgements? Cavallo has her
  business and her way of doing things and she's willing to pay a good price."  
"And what about Riccardo?"  
"He needs saving from himself. He should not be ruled by circumstance," Markham
  said bluntly. Alex always admired and respected Markham's hard-headed logic,
  the sign a successful businessman and slave-owner. Alex regretted remaining
  silent, as Markham's pale blue eyes met his.  
Markham turned the conversation. "You wouldn't ever find yourself ruled by
  circumstance, would you?"  
It was a rhetorical question, and a provocation. A simple yes or no wouldn't
  suffice, and Alex knew it. He settled in his chair and composed his thoughts
  for a moment.  
"I never thought so, but times change and so do people. I'm tired of all
  the travelling and leading a double life. I want to change my life, before
  it changes me."  
"And does this anything to do with your ponygirl friend?"  
Ponygirl friend! Alex ignored Markham's gentle teasing, but couldn't stop
  himself from talking about her. "She's not the cause of it, but she's an indicator
  of my recent state of mind. It could have been any slave until..."  
"Until what! Out with it, man, we've been here before."  
Alex took a deep breath. "It happened six months ago. I was out for lunch
  in an Italian diner in Brooklyn one day, meeting with Taylor Grange."  
"Oh yes I remember him. How is Dr Grange, these days?"  
"He's well, but this doesn't really concern him."  
"Oh?" Markham was becoming intrigued.  
"Taylor and I were talking about the far east, and my lecture tour to Thailand
  and Malaysia. You know, just catching up on things. Then Taylor was bleeped
  and had to rush back to Brooklyn Infirmary. I stayed to finish my lunch, having
  time to kill before my next meeting&hellip;  
"The proprietor of the joint, an Italian guy, struck up a conversation after
  I'd complimented him on the food. He seemed happy, quite a joker in fact, but
  I detected something troubling him. He'd probably heard us talking about psychotherapy,
  and I assumed he wanted professional advice. It was also possible that he'd
  read one of my books. Or perhaps he wanted me to sign one of my books for him?  
"But no, he hadn't any idea who I was, nor did he want to talk to a shrink.
  Instead, he wanted to talk about Thailand. I asked had he been there. He said
  no, but his daughter had. She'd gone there last year as a backpacker, but had
  never returned, nor even made contact&hellip;  
"I liked the guy; I truly did, and felt very sorry for his loss. He asked
  if I could do something next time I visited Bangkok. You know, make some enquiries,
  distribute some photographs and so on."  
"Why didn't he travel to Bangkok himself, if he cared that much about his
  daughter?" Markham asked.  
"His wife was badly hurt in a car wreck, and he couldn't leave her. She broke
  her legs and back but was recovering well. What struck me about him was his
  passionate optimism that his daughter was still alive somewhere. I told him
  that he should never give up hope. We went on to talk about other things, like
  baseball. He was a New York Mets fan, and I'm a Yankee fan as I'm sure you
  know. I joked I'd rather be at the Met than watching them. A typical Italian,
  that comment piqued his interest as I suspected it would, given that he shared
  his surname with Italy's most famous composer. We joked about that, and he
  suddenly burst into song, La Donna &egrave; Mobile! He was pretty good, a fine
  lyric tenor. I applauded him, and he tore up the check, tossing the pieces
  in the air like confetti...  
"I asked if he ever went to the opera. He said he hadn't been for a long
  while. I told I knew somebody at the house who could get heavily discounted
  tickets. I sent him a pair a couple of days later."  
Markham feigned indignation. "You never told me you could get discounted
  tickets!"  
"Ranulph! I can't!" said Alex. "I just wanted to repay him for the meal,
  without seeming to go overboard."  
"I'm still confused. What does this man have to do with anything?"  
Alex swallowed, recalling a particular moment. "As I was leaving the restaurant
  he gave me a photograph of his daughter, and asked me once again to look out
  for her when I next went to Bangkok. And if I saw her, to tell her how much
  her mom and dad loved her."  
Markham exhaled, and settled himself in his chair and rubbed his cheek. "The
  photograph? Is it who I think it is?"  
"Yes. I'm afraid so."  
Markham just nodded, patting Alex sympathetically on the shoulder. "And that's
  why you're so determined this ponygirl goes through the memory erasing program?"  
"Yes. I'd actually promised it to Jessica, I mean ponygirl Jessica, before
  that chance meeting with her father. She'll be one of the first to go through
  the program, not counting Cavallo's failed attempt to use it to long before
  it was properly developed."  
"Oh, you mean the armless girl. Janie?"  
"Yes, Janie. She didn't make the grade as a ponygirl on La Plata, so Cavallo
  decided to use her as a pawn in absurd game. She marked Janie with a Rabbit
  Island tattoo, gave her the drug treatment and set her free on a beach in Thailand.
  She expected that the trail would lead back to Rabbit Island." Alex laughed. "Foolish
  vain woman. She almost got away with it, but then she discovered that Rabbit
  Island fights back."  
Markham gave a coughing laugh. "Well at least their slaves do. One of your
  slaves cut off Cavallo's arms."  
"Let's be accurate. Cavallo's own surgeons did it. Kate only engineered the
  situation in order to save Jessica."  
"My Lord! What is it with those two slaves? I can't decide if they're the
  luckiest or the unluckiest people I've ever met."  
Alex shrugged. "Perhaps they are the luckiest unlucky people?"  
Markham paused to reflect. "Yes I like that! Makes for an interesting life
  I'll bet. Now, let's get to the point. You want me to help Riccardo? But if
  I agree to take on Calamity Kate and her new owner, I'd be surprised if Rabbit
  Island's committee will ever agree to Jessica being released. If she was, those
  two girls are certain to attempt to make contact in the future, and who knows
  what chaos they could unleash on the wider world."  
Both men laughed so much that Markham had to wipe away a tear. Alex composed
  himself quicker. He was in the mood for business.  
"I'd like to take that chance. Riccardo can work on your estate. He's a good
  trainer and handler. Kate will have her baby, and the rest is up to you."  
"You're asking a lot of me, Alex... but I'll do it. I'll provide the home,
  but I'm not interested in buying pregnant slaves. What happens after the birth
  is not my concern. I don't intend on opening a cr&egrave;che. Can Riccardo
  match Cavallo's offer?"  
Alex picked up the phone to the reception desk. "Erik, can you bring Janie
  into my office please?"  
A minute later the office door opened. Janie entered, wearing a dress designed
  by Carol to distract from her obvious disability. The front of the dress scooped
  down from her shoulders leaving her breasts bare. She wore a narrow black leather
  collar around her slim neck like a choker. Dropping from the front was a chain,
  its shape reminiscent of an anchor in the way it descended between her breasts,
  and then split in two, curving up to each of her newly ringed nipples. The
  distraction certainly worked on Markham. Noticing there were no other chairs
  in the office he invited Janie to sit upon his lap. His arms were instantly
  wrapped around her neat waist.  
Janie's memory, and her true character, seemed to improve with every day.
  She was gregarious, confident and witty too, and had no need or desire to trade
  on people's sympathies. Her sexual nature, a playful submissive and pain slut,
  had also resurfaced. Seeing her sit on Markham's lap, both of them smiling
  and flirting, Alex was satisfied that he had done the right thing in bringing
  her to Rabbit Island, knowing that he might just as easily have administered
  that fatal potion to her at their first meeting in Bangkok.  
"Janie. Who was it that cut off your arms?" Alex asked.  
"The sick bitch from hell. Cavallo. And just because she's joined the amputee's
  club, doesn't mean she's no longer a sick bitch from hell!"  
"I'm going to call her on the telephone now. Would you like to speak to her?" Alex
  asked.  
"Sure." She sounded surprisingly casual about it. (Alex already knew what
  her answer would be.)  
He dialled the number. It was answered, and after a brief transfer Alex was
  speaking to the lady herself. He despised her, but that didn't hinder his ability
  to engage in small-talk, having known her for many years. Then he got to the
  point:  
"I have somebody in my office who'd like to speak to you. Somebody with whom
  you have something special in common. Somebody who has a remarkably good memory,
  in spite of your best efforts. She's very talkative, and would dearly like
  to have a chat about old times."  
Cavallo was silent, utterly speechless. Alex imagined one of Cavallo's twin
  helpers holding the phone while the other fanned her. Cavallo correctly sensed
  that Alex had an agenda. "What do you want?" she snapped.  
"What's done is done. We all need to look to the future, not revisit the
  past. Don't you agree?"  
"I suppose so."  
"Then why do you want to buy a slave that has such terrible memories for
  you? Withdraw your bid and I'll make no more of your conspiracy to incriminate
  Rabbit Island."  
More silence from Cavallo's end, until she said: "I have an order for a baby
  to fulfil. $100,000"  
If we pay you $100,000 compensation will you withdraw your bid?"  
Cavallo agreed, and then abruptly hung up, depriving Janie of the chance
  to speak to her.  
GETTING TO THE CLIFF-TOP ON TIME  
Kate was fully engaged with the feeder when her cell door opened. She panicked
  as if caught in flagrante delicto, although actually she was doing nothing
  wrong.  
"Don't let me keep you from your lunch," Riccardo joked. He waited as she
  carefully pulled her mouth off the penis-like tube. "How's the food?"  
Kate shook her head. "I wouldn't know. I don't have taste buds in my throat." She
  knelt down on the floor in front of him, and proudly stuck out her chest, as
  instructed in Lucy's video.  
"Listen Kate. I have to inform you that your sale has gone through. You'll
  be leaving Rabbit Island in a few months."  
"Oh shit." She mumbled at the floor.  
"Your new owner doesn't appreciate that kind of language!"  
Kate lost her temper. "Riccardo, what the fuck do you care? I thought you
  did, but obviously you don't. I'm going to leave my friends here and might
  never see them again, and you tell me I can't say the word shit?"  
"I warned you, I don't appreciate such language."  
"Beat me then! Punish me! I'm no longer a person. I don't care any more.
  I'm sitting here in chains, sold off like a pregnant sow. Just a piece of merchandise."  
As Kate descended into tears, Riccardo stood motionless and quiet, waiting
  for her outburst to subside.  
She looked up at him and scowled. "What's so funny? Why are you smiling?"  
"You're mine. And so is the baby."  
Her face seemed to distort with confusion. "What are you talking about? You
  said they'd sold me!"  
"Kate, listen to me, you pregnant sow! They sold you, and I bought you. I'm
  your new owner, and there's something else too. Tests have confirmed that I'm
  going to be a father. You're carrying my child."  
Riccardo had never in his life seen, or expected to see, a smile to compare
  with Kate's at that moment. He helped her to stand, and they kissed with a
  reckless abandon that could only lead to one thing. He pushed her back onto
  the bed. Kate, with her hands pinned behind her, arranged herself on the bed
  as best she could, as Riccardo hurriedly removed his shorts. She looked up
  at him, panting with desire, desperate to feel his cock thrusting deep within
  her, as if for the first time.  
She wasn't to be disappointed; and even if it was the fastest fuck she'd
  had since her teenage years, it was also the most passionate.  
Afterwards, they lay squeezed together on the single bed, bodies entwined.
  Feeling reborn. Riccardo's hand couldn't help but caress Kate's belly, with
  the tender touch of his fingers. A belly of great significance. There was so
  much to explain; at a time which he could hardly make sense of it himself.  
Riccardo caught sight of his watch, suddenly shocked at how much time had
  passed.  
"We have to go. We've been invited to a wedding!"  
Kate didn't comprehend the last remark, so she ignored it. Riccardo jumped
  up, retrieving his clothing which was scattered around the cell floor, pulling
  on his shorts and underwear and slipping on his shoes.  
Then he grabbed Kate's nurse's clothes from his canvas bag. He didn't have
  the key to her handcuffs so had to dress her himself, employing the same brisk
  manner with Kate as he used when harnessing his ponygirls. First he clipped
  the garter belt around her waist, then rolling the white stocking up her legs,
  while Kate sat on the edge of the bed in a state of shock. Riccardo planted
  a delicate kiss on her small stocking-covered feet before strapping on her
  wedge heels. She stood up so he could dress her in her apron and tie the ribbons
  behind her neck and at her waist.  
They dashed from the cell-block as if making a jailbreak. His getaway transport,
  pulled by ponygirls Melinda and Diana, was standing outside ready to haul them
  in quick time to the cliff-top viewpoint a mile along the track.  
Kate could scarcely believe the scene that awaiting them: A wedding ceremony,
  complete with a bride in a white lace dress, and a groom in a suit and tie.
  It was Mia the former slave, and Jos&eacute; the gardener.  
Also present were Master Alex accompanied by Carol, Ranulph Markham with
  companion slave Linsey looking very glad to be back at his side; Charlie the
  slave trader, with Janie at his side; Vince accompanied by pussygirls Lucy
  and Anna, and Doctor Schmidt too.  
Not attending the wedding as guests, but still playing their part, were Jessica,
  Debbie, Sandra and Cathy. The ponygirl foursome stood ready to convey the newlyweds'
  back to the staff quarters. The four-seater carriage and its ponygirls had
  been specially decked out in white ribbons and flowers.  
Another one present but not on the guest list was Rachel, as she continued
  her pussygirl trials. Immediately after her release from the ponygirl's punishment
  frame, she had been taken to the preparation room to commence her three-day
  stint as a puppy. She seemed nervous and self-conscious, kneeling on tight
  leash at Carol's right hand side. It didn't help having Lucy and Anna debating
  whether it was good luck to have a dog at a wedding.  
Kate now understood why Dr Schmidt was so preoccupied by his paperwork that
  morning - he was preparing to officiate over this wedding ceremony.  
Doctor Schmidt wasn't the only one with a ceremonial role. Charlie was to
  give the bride away. Dozens of slaves had passed through his slave trading
  operation, but he'd never seen one as transformed as Mia. It was difficult
  to believe this woman was the sad drug-addicted whore he'd been obliged to
  take in a part-exchange deal many months ago. For week after week she sat forlornly
  in her small cage next to Janie's. And while he cleansed and cured her body,
  Janie attended to Mia's broken spirit. Now she stood, a bride dressed in dazzling
  sun-reflecting white, having a day she dared not dream of during her twenty
  years of hell in a Bangkok whore house.  
For a fleeting moment, Charlie considered quitting the slave trade for a
  new business in the booming Asian brides market.  
The doctor commenced the ceremony, his serious monotone according a formality
  and gravitas to the proceedings.  
Mia, partly concealed by a full veil, had her hands tied behind with a short
  length of white rope, almost invisible against the white of the dress. The
  doctor made some initial statements requiring short responses from Jos&eacute;,
  Mia and Charlie. Then Charlie untied the rope on her wrists, folded it neatly
  and presented it to her. She gazed at the rope, a simple yet potent symbol
  of her existence, literally in the palm of her hand. Just to have held it in
  her hand for a moment was sufficient. She handed it to Jos&eacute;.  
Further vows were uttered by bride and groom until there remained one final
  act to perform. Jos&eacute; bound her wrists in front of her using the same
  white cord, and presented her a small bouquet of orchids. The doctor pronounced
  them man and wife, eliciting spontaneous applause from those whose hands were
  able to clap. With perfect timing, Vince launched a daylight firework display
  that rained down confetti on them all.  
Markham and Alex talked over glasses of champagne and wedding cake, with
  Carol and Linsey - companion slaves, past and present - standing attentively
  at their side. Markham took in the scene of pussygirls, ponygirls, a nervous
  puppy, masters, a slave trader, a doctor and nurse, a gardener and his bride
  and declared: "Sheer folly, this wedding of yours, but jolly nice too!"  
Alex agreed. It was a rare and special moment - not just the wedding but
  being surrounded by the people he cared most about. Yet he had an unsettling
  feeling too. This assorted group was just a fraction of Rabbit Island's population.
  Most of them had chosen not to attend his 'folly', thus demonstrating how peripheral
  and isolated he had become in the new Rabbit Island hierarchy.  
The bride and groom were ready to depart for the domestic staff quarters,
  where a celebratory Filipino barbecue and party awaited them. Frank helped
  them up onto the rear seat of his carriage. With a wave and a thank you from
  Jos&eacute; they were off. Riccardo wiped tears from Kate's eyes as they watched
  the ponygirl foursome trot off at a brisk pace. Four sets of jingling boot
  bells adding a delightful soundtrack to their progress, until the sound faded
  into the distance just as they did.  
There was no rush or desire amongst the remaining wedding party to head back
  to the Lodge. They had plenty to eat and drink, and this grassy viewpoint was
  equipped with wooden stocks, pillars and frames, providing many avenues of
  amusement to be explored. Markham pointed out to Alex - quite correctly - that
  slaves become soft if not tested and disciplined, particularly after a light
  day like this. Besides, he added, he'd taken a Viagra pill before the wedding,
  and was ready for action.  
They chained pussygirls Lucy and Anna to opposite sides of a vertical whipping
  post, hands held high, the backs of their dresses unlaced and pulled down around
  their feet in readiness for a whipping.  
Linsey was undressed and tied within a spread-eagle frame so that everyone
  could appreciate her exotic all-over body tattoo. The rough grass rubbed harshly
  against her reddened rump, a painful reminder of her morning in ponygirl training.  
Janie ended up kneeling with her ankles in wooden stocks, her collar chained
  tightly to a securing point between her ankles, presenting the masters with
  any number of options.  
Riccardo magnanimously offered Kate's mouth to all those present. Still locked
  in her bunny chains, she was forced to kneel across Linsey's face, so she might
  receive pleasure as she gave it.  
Ranulph Markham was Kate's first client, unperturbed that he was standing
  astride his companion slave being fellated by another woman. He soon put an
  end to Kate's tentative sucking, gripping her short hair in his hand and pulling
  her head harshly back and forward without let up until his semen exploded into
  her mouth. It was just the way Kate liked it, but she could hardly tell him
  that. Charlie was next, and then Vince, delighted and flattered that Kate happened
  to have an orgasm as the same time as his own eruption.  
Kate didn't find the task a hardship, sucking one man after the other, she
  preferred it that way. One man was never enough. The hardest part was concentrating
  while coping with Linsey's amazingly dexterous tongue on her clit.  
Her fourth customer was Doctor Schmidt. She savoured this rare moment of
  intimacy between them, taking her time, treating his erect cock not just as
  something to be mechanically worked to ejaculation, but as an extension of
  him as a person, her boss, her guide. When his finger touched the front of
  her neck, Kate knew what she was required to do. Changing the shape of her
  spine and bending her neck backwards she took him into her throat. His fingers
  lightly played against her neck, both of them savouring the knowledge that
  the bulge in her throat was his.  
Carol handed Charlie puppy Rachel's leash. The Chinaman had never had a dog
  before, except for one time in a restaurant. He was at a loss as to what to
  do with her.  
Carol looked at Charlie with sympathy. "Just take her for a walk, throw her
  bone gag for her to fetch, let her sniff and pee in the bushes. And don't forget
  to stroke her and tell her what a good puppy she is! Tell you what, I'll come
  with you while the pussygirls are getting their thrashing!"  
Rachel crawled on the grass beside Carol as they walked along the cliff edge.
  She was in the usual puppy garb: a purely decorative black leather body harness
  and butt plug-tail, her hands balled into fists and covered in leather; and
  her feet in the same leather covering. The thick spike-studded collar combined
  with her blackened nose and heavy eye makeup to give Rachel that brutal-but-cute
  look required of a puppy girl. In her mouth she had a bone gag, a large rubber
  bone replica jammed between her teeth like a bit, and strapped around her head
  to keep it in place.  
Carol removed the bone gag and tossed it a short distance in front of her.
  Rachel scampered off after it, gingerly picking it up between her teeth and
  returning to her. She sat directly in front of Carol and rubbed the bone against
  Carol's crotch. "What a good girl!" Carol said, taking the bone from her and
  giving Rachel a chocolate drop in return. They walked past ponygirls Diana
  and Melinda, still fully harnessed and attached to their trap, not even giving
  them a second glance.  
Even Charlie had become blas&eacute; about ponygirls over the last couple
  of days, but puppy girls were new to him. He tossed the bone-gag, and Rachel
  chased after it, soon losing her canine inhibitions now that she was alone
  with Carol and Charlie. He recoiled in shock when Rachel returned and thrust
  the bone firmly and deliberately into his crotch. Carol and Charlie continued
  to toss the bone-gag for Rachel while they compared notes on their similarly
  bizarre lives. She promised to give him make up lessons the following day after
  he commented on what a good job she'd made of Mia the bride. He realised that
  if he could make a slave girl look her best it would increase her sale price.  
BUNNY BAGS  
By the time Carol and Charlie returned to the party, the Rabbit Islander's
  favourite pastime, a game of bunny bags, was under way. Kate, Lucy and Anna
  had been staked out, spread-eagled alongside Linsey, to create the appropriate
  XXXX shape for the game. All of them were blindfolded, firstly to protect their
  eyes from the sun, but also to heighten their suspense and shock when the bags
  land on them. And not wanting to leave out Janie, her ample breasts provided
  a handy repository for the wooden clothes pegs needed for this variant of bunny
  bags: red pegs on her right breasts and green on her left.  
Determined to exact revenge for the Ryder Cup defeat, Alex and Vince were
  taking on the Anglo/European axis of Ranulph Markham and Riccardo. Doctor Schmidt
  acted as referee.  
The first part of a bunny bags game is harmless. The players attempt to toss
  the small bean-filled bags onto the bellies of each bunny from a distance of
  five metres. The shock when one of those lands on her breasts or belly never
  fails to produce a squeal, and the blindfold ensures, quite literally, that
  the bunny never sees it coming. If a bag lands on her, the bunny has the prerogative
  to try to buck it off, however such action usually results in the amusement
  of the players and the subsequent tightening of her ropes.  
Depending on how the sixteen bags in each round have landed, scores are marked
  up by attaching clothes pegs to their nipples. With $2000 at stake, the men
  had more to worry about than the bunnies' protests about their nipples. As
  long as they were large enough for the pegs to clamp onto, the men were happy.  
The object of the second part of each game was to dislodge your opponent's
  pegs by aiming a bean bag straight at them. It required a strong and accurate
  throw. Most shots missed the peg but hit the breasts or ribs sideways on, often
  causing bruising. (After a bunny sustained a cracked rib last year, the weight
  of the bags was reduced this season.)  
A good hit makes an audible 'clip' as the peg comes off the nipple, sometimes
  tumbling several feet into the air. The peg's clip sound is immediately followed
  by a sudden cry of pain from the affected bunny, and a whoop of delight from
  the thrower.  
Although they weren't gagged, it didn't serve a bunny to protest; she'd merely
  single herself out for more attention.  
Carol was never much into sport, unable to appreciate the finer points of
  bunny bags, despite having been one of the spread-eagled participants on several
  occasions. She'd never actually tossed a bunny bag, and nor did she know if
  any woman had. Nonetheless she conjured with a delicious image of those four
  men tied down in place of the bunnies and having bean bags thrown at their
  genitals. They'd squeal every bit as much as those bunnies.  
She was an animal lover, in her element with something at the end of her
  leash, something that needed care and attention and responded to petting...
  like Rachel. The new puppy girl was beginning to get into character, and bonding
  with her new protector.  
"I think she's ready for her first reward," Carol said to Charlie, who wasn't
  much of a sports or animal lover. Having had too many chocolate drops already,
  Rachel sensed what that reward might be. Carol put her in 'show' position -
  a eject doggy posture with tail and head held high. She knelt down to one side
  of the puppy and reached a hand behind and between her legs, her other hand
  keeping Rachel on a very short leash.  
Puppy Rachel felt Carol's thumb pushing aside the leather harness strap to
  slip into her sex, leaving the fingers free to work on her clit. "Keep your
  chin up!" Carol said, loud enough that everyone turned to look. A firm tug
  on her collar further reminded Rachel who was in control. She bit down on her
  bone gag as Carol's busy fingers took her to the point of no turning back.
  There was simply no point in resisting, she grunted, she growled, she rocked
  her hips, a doggy as she could be, all to win Carol's compliment of "what a
  good bitch you are!"  
And then Carol stopped, wiping her wet thumb of Rachel's buttocks. "Stay!" she
  commanded, leaving Rachel to maintain formal doggy position, still facing towards
  the men, and on the brink of orgasm. Carol kissed Rachel's ear and whispered: "Perhaps
  in your kennel later, when you show me what your tongue can do, I'll finish
  off what I started."  
"Your ponygirls, Riccardo, they move a lot," Charlie commented as the bunny
  bags game was changing ends.  
Riccardo looked up and saw that Charlie had a point - Diana and Melinda seemed
  agitated. When he walked over and stood in front of them, their heads were
  facing downwards, not wishing to make eye contact in the way ponygirls usually
  did. He ran a finger in the groove between Diana's ringed labia. The reins
  were still threaded through the rings even though he knew it could cause irritation
  or possibly stimulation. He held his wetted finger up to Diana and wiped it
  harshly across her cheek.  
Markham approached the ponygirls, while Alex and Vince stayed with the bunny
  bags, discussing tactics. "Are they okay?" he asked his team-mate.  
Riccardo shook his head and sighed. "These two used to be Bruce's ponygirls.
  He warned me about this. They're fully harnessed, blinkered and turned to face
  down the trail and still they get turned on. They're both as wet as leaky faucets.
  Now I understand why he recommends using the spreader bar when they are parked
  up."  
He retrieved the spreader bar from its storage point under the driver's seat.
  It was a five-foot long black iron bar with four leather, buckling cuffs attached.
  Markham bent down to help strap it around the backs of Diana's and Melinda's
  pony-booted ankles. Riccardo pulled out a small lump of chalk adding three
  more vertical strokes to Diana's thigh.  
While the party continued, Diana and Melinda stood embarrassed, immobilised
  and sexually subdued by their combined spreader bar. Carol and Charlie stayed
  on a bench looking out to sea, drinking white wine and beer respectively, with
  an attention-seeking puppy girl at their feet.  
The bunny bags game was eventually decided. The score, for readers who need
  to know this kind of thing, was a 27-22 win to the Americans, and two sore
  breasts and nipples for each of the female participants.  
As the shadows of the sun grew longer, the group of six men, six women, two
  ponygirls and a puppy reluctantly left their idyllic scenery to stroll the
  mile or so back to the Lodge. Riccardo took Charlie in the passenger seat of
  the pony-trap, taking the long route back to give Diana and Melinda a much
  needed run.  
Rachel the puppy girl crawled obediently at Lucy's side, thankful that the
  doctor had bandaged her knees. Linsey clung devotedly upon Markham's arm and
  Carol had a similar grip on Alex, as assertive as a submissive could dare.  
It was nice to have a woman on his arm, Alex thought. It felt good to have
  arranged a marriage too; and of course he was happy Riccardo had acquired a
  suitable slave - one who was carrying his child. Kate, walking alongside and
  talking to Dr Schmidt, seemed to be the happiest person on the entire island.
  The irony, that the happiest person on the island was a slavegirl, wasn't lost
  on him.  
"You seem deep in thought, Alex," commented Carol.  
"I am, but that's not so unusual, is it?"  
She squeezed his arm, seeing through his non-committal reply. "If you ever
  want to talk about it, you know I'm here for you. Anytime."  
They must have walked five paces before Alex replied. "Thanks Carol, I could
  well take up your offer."  
The events of the day, the people around him now, and Ranulph Markham's earlier
  probing and prompting, had given Alex much to think about. He had to make a
  decision, and there was no easy option.

 After the leisurely walk back from the wedding and cliff-top party Alex
  and Charlie entered the reception area to check for messages. While waiting
  for the receptionist, Alex inspected the new gallery exhibits at the back of
  the lobby.  
 Apollo, the large erotic statue, had acquired a new lover. A young woman
  had her back pinned against his impossibly manly chest, and her arms and legs
  entwined backwards around him. It left her clear of the ground, supported by
  her coarse rope bondage and partly by Apollo's upturned penis lodged deep inside
  her anus. Her long dark hair was bound ponytail-style with a leather cord,
  pulled over the statue's shoulder and secured to her bound wrists behind Apollo's
  back.  
 Her naked body, writhing ever so slightly on her erotic impalement, seemed
  to invite attention. This was an exhibit where touching by visitors was encouraged,
  although her sex was marked off limits by an arched line of red lipstick. Alex
  reached up to grasp both her nipples, tugging and squeezing them and watching
  her open-mouthed arousal at the treatment. Her exposed and shaven sex gaped,
  glistening and needy.  
 "She wants a man!" Charlie observed.  
 "She'll get one, but not just yet." Alex laughed. It was a pity about the don't
      fuck the artwork  rule, but without such a rule she'd have been
      in a sorry state by the time Alex arrived. Meanwhile the reception desk
      had a bidding book running for the visitors who fancied having her after
      she was detached from Apollo.  
 A few feet away from her was another exhibit: Nancy's six months of automatic
  torment continued. Today she was marking time, quite literally. One wall of
  the gallery had become a living clock, with Nancy its hands, her body stretched
  within a revolving disk. To make the time more visible she was painted with
  a three inch wide black line that went from her sex, between her breasts, fully
  up her face to culminate in an arrow shape on her forehead.  
 She was upside down at the time of Alex's visit, indicating that it was
  half past the hour. Charlie was about to move on and back to his suite, but
  Alex suggested he stick around for another minute. Instead of a clock chiming
  the half-hour, Nancy received electric shocks from electrodes taped to her
  nipples. Two series of shocks and two shrieks of anguish from Nancy signalled
  that the time was half past five.  
 "Two cries from Nancy means it's half-past. On the three-quarter hour she'll
  get three shocks," explained Alex.  
 "What happens on the hour?" Charlie asked.  
 Alex grinned. "That's orgasm time!"  
 They moved closer to inspect the finer workings of the clock. They studied
  the V of Nancy's slim and tanned legs, the kind of thighs made for running
  your fingers up and down, except for Nancy the pleasure of a man's touch was
  forbidden. Alex showed Charlie the large vibrator filling Nancy's sex. "You
  should return in half an hour, she puts on quite a show apparently!"  
 A committee member happened upon them. "Howdy Alex, I sure hope the wedding
  went well. I heard that the bride, after working twenty years in a whorehouse,
  wore white," he said with evident disgust, "and what's this rumour that you'll
  be taking Sunday communion services soon? Jesus, it's all happy families with
  you these days, Alex."  
 "So it seems," said Alex shrugging it off with a smile. Although unfazed
  by the personal insult, he was annoyed that the man couldn't show more courtesy
  for Mia. After all, she was a free woman now, an employee on the island, not
  a slave.  
 "On the subject of communion," the man continued, just as Alex thought he
  was going, "you really should try the girl they've put in the O box. Boy, can
  she blow! Now that's what I call a religious experience!"  
 The thought of sharing a woman's mouth with this man, however unwilling
  on the her part, didn't appeal to Alex. The new committee members, like this
  cowboy, third generation oil magnate, were not to his liking, and nor, particularly
  recently, was he to theirs.  
A NEW POSITION   
 Jessica and Debbie had just settled down to a relaxing evening in the pony
  quarters. Their tack polishing was nearly done and Debbie was looking forward
  to using their latest luxury - a pack of playing cards - safe in the knowledge
  that, due to their following morning's shift, they were not available for selection
  in evening and night-time activities. So when a cardboard box arrived from
  the Lodge with their names on the instruction sheet, she assumed it was an
  administrative error.  
 "The Lodge needs an efficient secretary," Debbie joked. "I could have their
  offices running properly in no time!"  
 Diana read the instructions aloud. " Jessica and Debbie. Falcon
      position. Room 172. 9 pm to 11 pm.  It's pretty clear. I don't
      think we should argue with it."  
 Jessica sighed. "Falcon position? Never heard of it. So what's in the box?"  
 Diana looked into the box and frowned. "Not much." She held up a leather
  hood, with laces spilling from it. "Just two hoods and your own sets of bunny
  chains."  
 Jessica and Debbie 'hmmmed' in unison. This binding was disappointing. Spending
  their days in harness or totally naked, ponygirls revelled in the chance to
  dress up, even if it was corsets, or the rubber and latex garments favoured
  by some.  
 Diana and Melinda were disappointed too. There wasn't any rope tying to
  do. The task of binding their friends and fellow ponygirls used to disturb
  them, but they had to comply under threat of punishment (and perhaps more importantly)
  loss of privileges. After the first few tie-ups they grew accustomed to this
  treacherous task, both binders and victims, and the bondage became an intimate
  ritual between them. The masters would bind them anyway, so surely it was better
  done with the love and understanding of other ponygirls?  
 The instructions on the typed-out sheet were not merely guidelines, they
  were explicit, and expected to be followed to the letter. "It says hoods first," Diana
  sighed. It meant they couldn't chat while the binding proceeded.  
 "Haven't seen these before," said Melinda, examining the hood in her hands.
  She stood behind the seated Debbie, loosened the laces and offered it to Debbie's
  face. The inside of the hood had a built-in gag; a matchbox-sized protrusion
  of rubber. Debbie took a quick swig from a water bottle and allowed Melinda
  to push the rubber gag into her mouth. She smoothed it over Debbie's face,
  neck and head, and started lacing the back.  
 "Oh god, there's no holes for the mouth and eyes," cried Jessica. But in
  the middle of the mask there was an opening for the bottom half of Debbie's
  nose to poke through. "Are you okay, Debbie?"  
 Debbie nodded. Jessica swigged her water and submitted to the same treatment
  from Diana. Jessica bit down on the rubber insertion as Diana tightened the
  laces at the back of her hood. Even in a room with friends she already felt
  alone in the pitch-blackness of the falcon hood. Reaching her hand up to touch
  the hood, she felt like a stranger to her own body.  
 Next came the bunny collar, engraved with her own name. Because it covered
  the neck section of the hood it fitted tighter than usual, but not so tight
  as to worry her. The chain from the collar hung coolly against her spine. When
  the collar's padlock went 'click', there was not going back. Keys were not
  supplied. Diana, now more captor than colleague, tugged upwards on the chain
  to make her stand. Not wanting to test their friendship Jessica put her hands
  together behind her back allowing Diana to handcuff them.  
 Jessica and Debbie stood side-by-side at the door connecting their quarters
  to the Lodge. Ten minutes elapsed before Erik, the Lodge's handler, came for
  them. He clipped a Y-shaped leash to Jessica's right nipple ring and Debbie's
  left and tugged. In the darkness of hoods they followed him to room 172.  
***  
 It was a normal guest room, nicely furnished like any four star hotel, and
  nothing Jessica and Debbie wouldn't have seen before. Erik unclipped their
  nipples and separated them by a few paces. He made them kneel, a light tap
  of his toe against the shin being the accepted signal. Then another touch of
  Erik's shoe told Jessica to open her knees. She sat and waited.  
 These rooms, so like hotel rooms in most respects, had certain extras not
  found at the Holiday Inn. Whilst normal hotels had more drawer space than you
  would ever require, many of the drawers in these room were already in use.
  One drawer was full of rope, hanked so neatly you'd think it has never been
  used. Each rope carried a tear-off paper band, stating its length in feet and
  metres. (The Island's committee still hadn't agreed whether to standardise
  on metric or imperial.)  
 Erik selected a couple of two-metre lengths of red rope. From the drawer
  below the rope he took a couple of black leather belts. He slammed the drawers,
  startling both of the blind ponygirls.  
 Jessica waited, listening to faint sounds of activity, and sensed that Debbie
  was being rigged. A few minutes later it was her turn.  
 First, Erik used the leather belts to strap each of her thighs to its respective
  ankle. Then he used the rope for an altogether more intimate bondage. Exactly
  beneath Jessica's sex was securing point, a D ring which folded flush with
  the floor until needed. He flipped it up and looped the red rope through it.
  From there he threaded the rope through all of Jessica's six labial piercings,
  then upwards. She could hear her nipple bells tinkling as Erik slipped the
  cords through her nipple rings. He pulled up the slack and Jessica shivered
  as she felt the friction of rope on her labia and the sensitive tips of her
  nipples. He tied the two ends together in a bow-knot between her breasts and
  allowed the remaining ends to dangle decoratively towards her belly.  
 Then Erik took a tray of a dozen large candles from a drawer, lit them and
  placed them around the room. He switched off the ceiling light, enjoying how
  the light and shadow of the candles reflected on the ponygirls' toned skin.
  He was very pleased, and considerably aroused by his creation. The ponygirls
  seemed so serene, as if pacified by this intimate bondage. These two strongest
  of female slaves, sitting restrained and suppressed, gave the room a powerful
  aura of eroticism. Satisfied with the result, Erik left Jessica and Debbie
  to their evening entertainment.  
 As soon as she heard the door close, Debbie gave a 'clear-the-throat' cough.
  Jessica coughed in imitation and instinctively knew they were similarly rigged.
  But how, she wondered, will somebody take her or punish her in that position?
  There wasn't a clear expanse of skin for whipping, and access to her mouth,
  sex, and anus was denied by her bondage.  
 Jessica tried to move, filling her lungs and lifting her chest. The rope
  connecting her rings to the floor limited her chest's upward movement. She
  tried turning her torso and felt the rope running across her most sensitive
  flesh for an inch or two before tugging again. The falcon position, Jessica
  began to realise, was designed specifically for ponygirls, or those with such
  piercings. If she stayed motionless she could barely feel the rope, but if
  she moved, her nipples were tugged and her labia were rubbed, and the worst
  thing about it was that it felt good.  
 The door opened.  
 Jessica and Debbie ceased their struggles and sat up straight, as if to
  attention. The man's footsteps (undoubtedly a man's, Jessica thought) stopped
  between and in front of the two of them. It was an inspection. The room was
  silent, broken only by their deep nasal breathing, almost in unison. He admired
  how their chests slowly expanded each time they breathed in through their noses.
  As ponygirls, in peak physical condition, they had excellent lung capacity
  and body strength, particularly in their thighs, and this bondage was designed
  to show it off, perhaps also to mock it.  
 He looked closely at Jessica and found something deeply erotic about her
  slightly broad nose, exposed and displayed while the rest of her face remained
  hidden, encased in leather.  
 If she had been blindfolded, her wet and sensual lips would have the attention;
  drawing a man to them with their subliminal representation of even softer,
  moister lips below.  
 If she were gagged, it would be her eyes, the window to her soul, the betrayer
  of her desires, which made a man need to possess her.  
 This time it was her nostrils. They moved and flared; her nose twitched
  more that he ever noticed before. Whether it was the deep nasal breathing,
  the fear and uncertainty of what was to come, the discomfort, or perhaps it
  was simply the arousal caused by her most intimate of bondage. He almost reached
  out a finger to touch.  
 Master Alex left the room after barely a minute, closing the door softly
  behind him.  
 The door opened again shortly afterwards. A man and a woman entered. He,
  in formal black tie, she in a glittering evening gown, her hands bound behind
  her with a red silk scarf.  
 She was his lover, a guest on the Island just like him. The man had visited
  several times before, for her it was the first time.  
 "Untie me please, honey! Please don't make me beg."  
 He laughed. "That's exactly what I was going to do; and you'll be begging
  for more than that pretty soon."  
 She wriggled out of his embrace as they entered the candlelit bedroom. It
  took her a few moments to register that they weren't alone. She gulped. "Oh
  my god!"  
 He smiled, and pulled apart his tie. "What do you think?"  
 "What are they? I mean, who are they?"  
 "Oh, just a couple of ponygirls," he said, displaying a man's annoying habit
  of being nonchalant about something of which he was so obviously proud. "I
  thought it would be nice to have some erotic decoration. What do you think?"  
 She exhaled, still confused. "I don't know. I mean, wow! These are really
  ponygirls? Jesus, have you seen how they're tied?"  
 "Sexy isn't it? It's called the falcon position. Just like in falconry,
  where they keep their birds hooded and secured, we now have a similar thing
  for ponygirls." He squeezed his lover from behind, nuzzling her neck. "Don't
  worry babe, they're perfectly safe. You can see their hands are cuffed and
  chained behind them."  
 She leant over Jessica to confirm that the falcon position was hopelessly
  secure.  
 The man grabbed her and the silk scarf dropped from her wrists with one
  tug of his hand. He unzipped the back of her dress, slowly peeling it from
  her shoulders until it slipped down, creating a glistening pool of fabric around
  her feet. She faced him, resplendent in a tight white basque, stockings and
  suspenders.  
 They embraced and kissed passionately, giving their lovemaking an inexorable
  momentum. They fell onto the bed, a muddle of desperate grasping limbs. His
  hands ripped off her panties with a single violent tug.  
 "Aren't you going to tie me up?" she gasped.  
 "You want me to?" he asked between kisses.  
 "Yes! Yes!"  
 He scampered off the bed, retrieved the red silk scarf, and hastily bound
  her hands to the headboard. And then he was on her, and inside her.  
 They fucked with a mutually uninhibited passion, a conversation of ecstatic
  moans. Meanwhile Jessica and Debbie knelt, blind and motionless falcons barely
  ten feet away. Every time Jessica moved she felt the ropes rub and tug against
  her labia and nipples, restricting her, yet tormenting her too. That, combined
  with the mid-coital cries coming from the bed, had set Jessica into a rhythm
  of sympathetic arousal, aided rather than hindered by the intimate roping of
  her rings. The combination of leather straps blinding her thighs, the smooth
  implacable metal of her handcuffs and the close-fitting hood and its rubber
  gag seemed designed to provoke as much as restrain her, Jessica couldn't help
  but respond to such provocation.  
 The couple's orgasmic crescendo came, and soon subsided and slipped into
  loving caresses.  
 "What's that noise?" the woman whispered.  
 "Noise?"  
 "Like little bells! I keep hearing it."  
 The man turned his head towards Jessica and laughed. "It's one of the falcons.
  Her nipple bells. I think she wanted to join us! Or maybe she's giving a musical
  accompaniment?"  
 The woman was still lying on her back, her fingers idly toying with her
  silk binding connecting her wrists the bed. She could have freed herself if
  she had wanted to. "The poor thing. I feel sorry for her."  
 The man rose from the bed and stood in front of Jessica, his diminishing
  penis just inches away from her. He grasped it in his hand, yanked it several
  times, and made as if to spurt on her - the upper swell of her breasts made
  a fine target. "Another time perhaps," he said wistfully before returning to
  the bed.  
 The couple made love again, and again they heard the tinkling of bells.
  This time they chuckled, joking that perhaps they were there for the ponygirls'
  titillation, rather than the other way.  
 Having downed the last of the bottle of champagne, they dressed and left
  the room to return to the party in the Lodge's main hall.  
***  
 Jessica and Debbie were alone once more. This time they fully felt the awful
  constraint of the falcon position in their folded legs. Both sought the comfort
  of even a minor change of position, but their struggles only served to remind
  them of the cruel elegance of their bondage. The patience and endurance they
  learnt as ponygirls was put to the test.  
 Ten minutes later Erik returned to the room. He untied the rope which had
  tormented Jessica for the last hours, tossing it and the leg belts into a small
  laundry basket (to be tidied by the 'rope-maid' in the morning.) He allowed
  the ponygirls to sit on the bed and stretch their legs for a moment before
  clipping the Y-leash to one nipple of each and leading them from the room.  
 Jessica assumed they were heading back to their quarters, but thirty paces
  down the hallway Erik tapped on a door and unclipped the leash from her nipple.
  She felt a man grip her arm and pull her into the room, closing the door quietly
  behind them.  
 While she stood nervously in the middle of the room, the new captor quietly
  circled around her, inspecting her. She felt the leather flap of a riding crop
  trailing over her breasts; then suddenly it rapped sharply on her flesh above
  her sex. She gasped; the muffled sound demonstrating the effectiveness of the
  hood and its built-in rubber gag. The next swipes of the crop were on her buttocks,
  surprising her more than hurting. Her pulse and breathing rate increased as
  she stood waiting for the next blow to land, not knowing where that might be,
  or how hard. Bound only in her bunny cuffs, she might have resisted or cowered
  to deflect the blows, but the blindness of the hood made it an unfair fight.  
 The crop struck her upper arm, then the back of her thigh, then her belly,
  and then on her shaven mound. And with each hit Jessica recoiled and her nipple
  bells jingled. Her unseen assailant just laughed.  
 He unlocked her handcuffs. Jessica assumed it was to bind her to something
  sturdy, but that didn't happen. Instead he continued teasing her with the riding
  crop. Even with her hands free she couldn't protect herself, unable to guess
  where the next blow might land. He didn't even intervene as she pressed her
  right arm across her breasts and cupped her left hand over her sex. It still
  left ninety percent of her flesh available to him.  
 The crop struck the back of her left hand, protecting her sex. Jessica responded
  by moving it, assuming that was what the master's demanded. The next blow landed
  on her clitoris. Jessica cried with pain, recoiled, and moved her hand to cover
  sex again. Next time, she resolved, she wouldn't move it.  
 The crop struck her hand again, and Jessica, in instinctive obedience, moved
  it away again. Then she moved it back to cover her sex before he could strike
  again. She cursed this man's stupid power game. He laughed, and swatted her
  hand, but this time much harder.  
 He walked behind her, striking her buttocks and admiring how decorative
  the empty handcuffs looked, dangling the length of her spine from the chain
  connected to her collar. He poked the riding crop through the crack of her
  thighs until it touched her labia and the palm of the hand attempting to protect
  it. Jessica had to allow the crop to rub back and forward under her anus and
  sex. She had simply run out of arms.  
 "Hold your hands out to your sides!" commanded the voice behind her.  
 Jessica complied instantly, lifting her arms like wings, knowing too well
  the cost of disobedience. She felt a gentle breeze in her left armpit as he
  crouched to walk under her arm. She bit down on the rubber gag and waited for
  the crop to land. It didn't. Instead, she felt his lips kiss the back of her
  left hand, which a minute earlier had been kissed by the crop. Why would a
  man kiss her hand, Jessica wondered. It seemed so cruel, mocking her like that,
  taking advantage of her because she was blind.  
 She felt both his palms on her breasts, squeezing them gently, rubbing against
  her hard nipples, taking his time. Then his hands slowly slipped down to rest
  on her hips.  
 Meanwhile her own hands were still held awkwardly at her sides. It wasn't
  fair to treat a ponygirl like this, she wanted to say. As a slave under his
  control, she preferred the certainty of bondage to the torment of partial freedom.  
 Then Jessica sensed a trembling and an intensity in the man's fingers. He
  was becoming aroused. "Is it you, Alex?" She wanted to ask. She reached out
  her hands and touched a man's naked body in front of her. She deduced he had
  the right amount of chest hair, and tracing down to his stomach found the scar
  she had often seen but never touched.  
 Alex led her to his bed, not as a slave but as a sightless lover. Her hands
  touched something! She had touched it before, with her lips, her breasts, her
  sex, her thighs, but never before with her hands - Alex's erect penis. She
  caressed it as a blind woman might and felt it grow impossibly large as her
  fingers ran up and down it. Perhaps it was the falcon hood... affecting each
  of them in different ways?  
 He pushed her down on the bed. Jessica felt his weight upon her. He pulled
  her hands out to her side, gripping her wrists, bondage made of a man's muscle
  as he crucified her with his own body. The loose handcuffs were digging painfully
  into the flesh of her back. Alex's cock, so large in her hands, just moments
  before, seemed every bit as large as he thrust it into her, conquering her
  from within. Only able to breathe through her nose, Jessica began to struggle
  for the oxygen her body's arousal demanded.  
 Alex slowed, allowing her to quieten beneath him as he continued to take
  her. He came while she was still a distance from her orgasm and tonight he
  wasn't inclined to remedy that situation. His need came first and hers nowhere,
  at least not her physical need.  
 Afterwards, they lay on the bed, Jessica's leather-encased head resting
  on Alex's shoulder, his left arm under and around her. She pressed her body
  against his side trying to create a seamless join from ankle to shoulder. She
  had a bizarre thought, almost laughing out loud, wishing that they could be
  zipped up together through the full length of their bodies.  
 Alex studied her perfectly formed nose, the lower half protruding in isolated
  splendour from the tight-fitting leather hood. He liked how her nostrils flared
  during her arousal, enjoying the similarities with a bunny's namesake. He'd
  kissed her nose several times while he was making love to her and almost succumbed
  to biting it one occasions. As she lay pressed tightly against the side of
  his body, he licked it, leaving it cool and wet. She responded by pressing
  herself even closer to him.  
 A knocking at the door shattered their intimate repose.  
 Alex rose from the bed, helping Jessica to sit and then stand up. His hands
  grasped hers, but only to refasten them into their cuffs. He briskly rubbed
  her body with a towel, drying her of perspiration, and led her to the door.
  She seemed to wilt, and Alex sensed her upset at being ushered out of his room
  after barely half an hour, but he didn't want to break the working ponygirl
  curfew, having already stretched the rules by taking her to bed. He almost
  told her that tomorrow, with the change in her shift pattern, he planned on
  keeping her for the entire night.  
 Jessica felt the leash being clipped to her nipples again, and prayed that
  the next destination would be the ponygirl quarters. She heard a quiet, almost
  conspiratorial 'Thanks Erik' from Alex just before the door closed.  
 As she was led back to her quarters, Jessica tugged resentfully against
  the handcuffs that had once again ensnared her. Something Kate said a while
  back echoed in her mind:  
 "The same handcuffs can feel different depending on who puts them
      on me. I can still feel a man's spirit within the handcuffs hours later.
      Sometimes, if the man has been nasty, it leaves me feeling uncomfortable
      and upset, as if he still has a hold on me. But if the man was passionate
      and treated me well, it feels like I'm still in his embrace."   
 Jessica finally understood what Kate meant. And when Erik released her from
  the hood and the cuffs upon their arrival at the ponygirl quarters she felt
  there was something missing: No longer 'embraced', as Kate might say. Jessica
  went immediately to the bathroom and splashed cold water over her face and
  head.  
 Debbie was the only one awake in the quarters, listening to a string quartet
  on the sixties-style all-in-one box record player and playing solitaire with
  the newly acquired playing cards. She had developed a taste for classical music
  since becoming a ponygirl, but since all of the LP's was classical, that wasn't
  so surprising. 'Just another means of controlling them,' Debbie had said when
  the record player and its collection of records first arrived. Since then she
  had become the record player's most avid listener.  
 Jessica sat down next to Debbie and smiled. "What's the music? It's nice."  
 "Beethoven's string quartet opus hundred and thirty-one," said Debbie before
  sensing that something wasn't right. "Since when have you been interested in
  music? Come on Jessica. What happened?"  
 As a ponygirl pair Debbie and Jessica shared everything - their running,
  the cleaning of their tack, the praise and punishments from their driver, and
  not least, their knowledge of what was happening around them and to them. To
  run successfully together meant knowing how the other one was feeling; being
  in step in both body and mind.  
 "Out with it! What happened to you?" Debbie demanded.  
 "I was taken into a room. The man pushed me onto his bed and fucked me." Jessica
  shrugged her shoulders. "No big deal really."  
 Debbie gazed at Jessica, patient but insistent. Usually Jessica was far
  more forthcoming in talking about her enforced assignations.  
 "Why are you staring at me like that?" asked Jessica.  
 "A man? Who? What did he smell like? I need to know!" Debbie probed.  
 Jessica smiled coyly and then whispered, as if to thwart an eavesdropper. "Alex."  
 Debbie tutted, and shook her head in disapproval.  
 Jessica looked away, knowing she couldn't begin to explain what had happened
  to her.  
 The Beethoven quartet continued to play, and both just listened. Jessica
  hadn't realised how nice the music was until then.

*** 
Today was the day of the famous Rabbit Island bunny hunt. Twenty naked females
  had been let loose upon MacDonald's Peak, the rocky outcrop at the highest
  point of the island. The bunnies were handcuffed and ballgagged, and also wore
  heavily tinted swimming goggles, which not only protected their eyes from gun
  shots but limited their vision, turning a bright morning into twilight. 
A meeting point for the �hunters' had been established where the trail passed
  the base of the peak, a convenient place where three pairs of ponygirls and
  their trailers were parked up waiting for the paintgun-equipped predators to
  bring in their catches. 
Needless to say, it wasn't a fair contest, at least not between master and
  bunny. Not only did the pellet from the paint gun sting terribly on contact,
  but the sticky yellow paint caused an awful burning of the skin if not removed
  within a minute of the hit. Therefore a �killed' bunny would usually come running
  up to her killer pleading to have the paint wiped from her, thus submitting
  to her capture. 
Ponygirls Jessica and Debbie had sneakily manoeuvred their pony cart around
  a few degrees so they could witness a little of the scene their blinkered view
  provided. They watched ponygirls Melinda and Diana's trailer being loaded.
  Five naked bunnies were laid belly-down onto the single-axle trailer, each
  hog-tied with leather cords and facing in alternate directions to compact their
  overall form to the size of the trailer. Then a net was cast over them and
  fastened to cleats under the lip of the traile, ensuring that none were lost
  in transit. 
This wasn't just a competition for the masters, but also for the bunnies.
  The winning bunny was the one who evaded capture for the longest. For Jessica
  this was a time for mixed feelings - last year, as a bunny, she had won. The
  winner was assumed to be the most rebellious and most able or willing to resist;
  and yet that rebellion, at least for the winner, was met with reward and privilege
  rather than punishment. Jessica remembered how they dressed her in the colourful
  finery of a picture-book slavegirl, and how she sat at Master Alex's side during
  a evening of festivities. She even drank from his champagne glass. 
In retrospect, Jessica realised it was a master-stroke of psychology, something
  which had eroded her resistance to such an extent that less than a year later
  she was a highly trained ponygirl about to carry this year's winner to her
  dubious prize. Jessica felt ashamed of her weakness as she watched the final
  two bunnies succumbing to the leather-thonged hog-ties they would endure for
  their journey back to the Lodge. 
�This one's the winner,� one of the men announced, pointing down to a feisty
  blonde who continued to offer resistance, even when in the grip of a stringent
  leather cord hog-tie. Jessica immediately felt a pang of jealousy. Despite
  her cruel binding this woman was still free in spirit - a fighter. And tonight
  that spirit would be rewarded and corrupted by privilege just as Jessica had
  been. She would be tasting champagne and caviar at the side of a master. And
  that was what troubled Jessica. Would that master be Alex? It felt as if her
  reign as bunny hunt champion had just expired. 
Jessica felt a slight jolt as a bunny was loaded onto the trailer behind her.
  Others followed, each lashed down in place, their bellies hard against the
  wooden planking of the trailer bed, soft feminine flesh pressed against the
  fellow captives. Jessica felt a strange shiver of erotic excitement at the
  drama of five trussed-up bunnies behind her. 
Frank tugged on the reins and pressed the whipper button, and Jessica's buttocks
  stung from the mechanical whip it unleashed. She and Debbie crouched slightly
  and pushed with their thighs until their heavy load began to roll forward.
  Only because the route to the Lodge was downhill were they we able to pull
  such a heavy burden. 
Soon they were making a steady pace back to the Lodge, the trailer seeming
  to have a momentum of its own behind them. The hog-tied bunnies were asleep,
  lulled by their own exhaustion, the swish of the trailer's bicycle wheels on
  the gravel track and the jingling rhythm of bells from the ponygirls' boots. 
Frank was an excellent driver, able to guide and prompt his ponygirls through
  the numerous bends in the trail with a minimal loss of momentum. Quite simply
  he possessed his ponygirls in body and mind, as thoroughly as their harnesses
  gripped them. His tugs on their reins, and the resulting twitches in their
  nipples and labia were like a secret code, instructing, encouraging, praising
  and criticising. To think that ponygirls were brainless couldn't be further
  from the truth. The concentration required to interpret a driver's commands
  left Jessica and Debbie mentally as well as physically exhausted. 
They reached the cobbled courtyard of the Lodge. Its hard stone surface combined
  with metal studs on the bottom of ponyboots to make a distinctive hard-edged
  clipping sound that echoed around the surrounding buildings. The noise was
  by design - it was the sound that signified the arrival or departure of ponygirls. 
The ponygirls stood motionless, trying to catch their breath as they were
  relieved of their load. Men released the cargo of bunnies from their hog-ties
  and marched them to the hose-down area. 
Jessica and Debbie were taken to the ponygirl punishment frames for five lashes.
  Just five faults in a day was pretty good, but Frank made each lash count,
  pausing to puff on his cigarette between each stroke. Jessica was grateful
  for the rubber-covered bit between her teeth, clenching on it with each stroke
  on her buttocks. 
Frank led his ponygirls back into their quarters, pushing them through the
  iron-barred door of the tack room. Their fist-shaped hands seemed to twitch
  in the anticipation of being freed from their mesh coverings. Frank pulled
  the mitts from Jessica's hands and unbuckled the strap holding them in the
  small of her back. Then he unbuckled the two leather bands that encircled her
  upper arms and chest. The rest of her ponygirl bondage, and all of Debbie's,
  Jessica would have to do for herself. 
Debbie stood patiently fully bitted and harnessed while Jessica removed her
  harnessing. Only then, with a teasing smile, did she attend to her partner.
  It wasn't wise to take any liberties from her advantageous situation, as next
  time it might be Debbie who was first released. 
When both were naked except for their butt-tails swishing against their inner
  thighs, they headed to the bathroom for a cold shower. Only then did they gently
  pull out their butt-tails, which they cleaned as they showered. 
Ponygirls had no clothes except for harnesses and boots, so after drying themselves
  they sat naked at their communal table for a late lunch. A bowl of raw
  power  vegetables and fresh bread had been provided, together with two
  plastic glasses of orange juice. They ate and talked about their day, not so
  much about their human cargo but about how well they'd managed to haul such
  a heavy load. 
After lunch they went straight to work polishing their tack. The sense of
  irony, that they should lavish so much care on the leatherware that kept them
  in total subservience to a pony driver, had long since evaporated. The leather
  harnesses and boots had to shine, or punishment would follow. It was that simple. 
They'd only just finished tack cleaning when the bell rang on the door that
  connected their quarters to the Lodge. It wasn't out of politeness but simply
  to alert them that something had been delivered. 
Debbie retrieved the delivery, and placed the box on the table. �It's for
  you,� she said, reading the printed instructions taped to the lid. 
Jessica grimaced, fearing that it might be the falcon hood again, but then
  Debbie's quizzical expression made her think otherwise. 
Debbie gazed at her sympathetically. �Sorry, Jessica, it looks like your time
  is up. They've finally discovered something the rest of us have known for a
  while.� 
�What?� 
�You've done well to keep it from them, but sooner or later they'd know.� 
Jessica was becoming increasingly concerned. �Debbie, what is it?� 
Debbie held up the main item in the box - a shapeless garment of heavy white
  canvas with numerous leather straps hanging down. �I believe they call this
  a straightjacket. You are officially mad!� 
Jessica smiled. �Oh, that's okay then. I thought it was something serious.
  It may surprise you, but I've never worn one of those before.� She might have
  added that she'd wanted to wear one for as long as she could remember. 
Debbie managed to hold it up in the correct orientation. �Hold up your arms
  Jessica, we only have ten minutes.� 
The straightjacket was the real thing, tailored to fit a woman's form. As
  Jessica pushed her arms into it and Debbie pulled, it seemed to swallow her
  up. Debbie spared no effort in ensuring the straps at Jessica's back were buckled
  to their tightest notch, while its wearer flapped her canvas-encased hands
  in front of her. The strap at the neck, buckled behind, had the appearance
  of a collar. When Debbie commanded, Jessica crossed her hands at her waist
  so the straps could be tied around the opposite hip. Even acknowledging the
  fact that Debbie might be punished if Jessica's bondage wasn't tight enough,
  she approached the task of binding her friend with a certain relish. 
Jessica looked down to see a strap hanging down to her knees: the dreaded
  crotch strap. Debbie stood in front of her, and first fastened a strap over
  where her arms crossed over her belly. This was designed to prevent the escapologist's
  technique of passing her arms over her head. Debbie lifted the crotch strap
  to Jessica's lips and made her grip it between her teeth. She returned to the
  box and lifted out a two-foot length of red ribbon. 
�I wonder what this is for?� said Debbie with a sneer, holding up the ribbon
  as if it were a worm she'd just dug out of the ground. 
Jessica knew exactly what it signified, and so did Debbie. It meant an imminent
  summons from Master Alex. 
�Please don't tie knots in it,� Jessica begged, �last time you did that, Master
  Alex needed a knife to cut me free!� 
Debbie knelt in front of Jessica, and threaded the red ribbon through her
  labia rings, like lacing a shoe. �Jesus - what a pervert!� she sighed. 
�He's okay. He just thinks it looks pretty,� said Jessica through gritted
  teeth, she was still biting down on the end of the crotch strap. 
�I meant you!� Debbie laughed and blew lightly onto Jessica's sex, making
  her quiver. �Does Master Alex kneel down and untie the ribbon with his teeth?� 
�Uh uh,� Jessica replied shaking her head slightly. He hadn't so far. 
Debbie finally took the strap from Jessica's mouth and brought it between
  her legs, ensuring that the bow and ends of the red ribbon spilled out on either
  side of the strap as it passed under her crotch. After a harsh tug that brought
  Jessica onto her toes, Debbie buckled the end in the middle of Jessica's back. 
�Now try to escape!� 
Jessica twisted her torso a few times, then shrugged to indicate she was defeated. 
�Good! I hate those pathetic things these escapologist wear. Honesty I've
  had sweaters that were harder to remove than some of those so-called straight-jackets.
  How does it feel?� 
�Tight,� said Jessica grimacing, �thanks to you! And don't you dare say it
  suits me!� 
�Okay, let's just say, I think Master Alex will be delighted at seeing you
  safely strapped up for his private pleasure. We all know about that red ribbon.
  It means don't wait up for Jessica, she won't be coming home tonight.� 
Jessica blushed. �He likes ponygirls and enjoys teasing me, that's all. Just
  look at me, all strapped up! I'm nothing to him except a toy. If he wants to
  be with a real woman he has Carol, and who can blame him?� 
�Oh? So Diana told you what she saw yesterday?� 
�Yes. Master Alex and Carol, arm in arm, just like a regular couple. I'm happy
  for them, really I am. They're a good match don't you think?� 
Debbie shook her head in disgust. �That's not what you really believe, is
  it?� 
�She's a free woman, and a lovely person as well, and I'm a ponygirl. Debbie,
  we're prisoners here. It's not a dating camp, at least not for us. 
�It's worked out that way for Riccardo and Kate.� 
�He's bought her. That's all. She's still a slave, and now he's a slave-owner,� said
  Jessica becoming increasingly irritated. �I'm just trying to please Master
  Alex so keeps his word and releases me next year. I hope their memory washing
  procedure works completely. Then it'll be like this whole thing never happened.� 
�That's what you think? Methinks it's time for the gag before this madwoman
  speaks any more nonsense.� Debbie held up the ballgag harness. �Open wide!� 
The doorbell rang, and Jessica, freshly gagged, walked herself towards the
  door where Erik was waiting to escort her. 
�Jessica,� Debbie shouted, causing her to stop and looking around. �Don't
  underestimate Master Alex!� 
*** 
The afternoon's festivities took place outside on the Lodge's main lawn and
  corral. Ponygirls seldom went outdoors without a harness, so Jessica was pleased
  to be in the sunshine, even though confined by a straightjacket. 
Erik led her to a raised seating area overlooking the lawns. She knelt by
  a �master chair' - a heavy wooden chair equipped with securing points so that
  a kneeling slave could be chained to it. Erik did just that, clipping a length
  of chain to a D ring at the front of the straightjacket's collar. 
Jessica found that having her collar chained to a master chair seemed to settle
  her, perhaps because she knew nothing much would be required of her. She could
  sit and take in the afternoon's events as a spectator, and might even be fed
  with morsels of food and drink. All she needed to do now was sit up straight
  and give the master an occasional glance of submissive adoration, whilst trying
  not to dribble on his thigh. 
She looked around, taking in the scene assembling on the lawn before her eyes.
  Sturdy poles, whipping posts, suspension frames, and stocks stood in readiness
  for the arriving bunnies. The bunny hunt was merely a warm up for these proceedings,
  a sporting way to gather them together for the upcoming entertainment. Jessica
  was amused by the facial expressions of the bunnies as they were herded around,
  under the gratuitous whip-wielding supervision of the handlers. 
The newer bunnies seemed wide-eyed with terror whilst the older residents
  (those that Jessica knew from her time as a bunny) chatted quietly together,
  sometimes sharing a smile in response to a joke shared between them. They'd
  seen it all before, or at least hoped they had. 
The handlers were going to each bunny, fitting heavy padded ankle bands to
  join their ankles, so that all they could do was hop. With their hands cuffed
  behind them, they were in a precarious situation, in constant danger of losing
  their balance. 
�Hey sweetie. How are you?� 
Jessica was startled. She hadn't seen Alex approaching. He sat down and ran
  his hand over her leather-strapped head as if she were a pet dog. She scowled
  back at him and shook herself as if to complain about her tight bondage. Alex
  wouldn't have expected any less from her. He leant back to examine the strap
  arrangement at the back of Jessica's straight-jacket. 
�What a neat bundle of fun you are, Jessica. You've given me a hard-on.� Alex
  pointed to his crotch just in case she didn't know where it was. Jessica gazed
  at pyramid shape in his shorts, perhaps for too long, her ballgagged mouth
  a mere nine inches away. She found herself dribbling, as she often did when
  she wore a ballgag. 
�Maybe the bunny hop race will take my mind off it?� Alex suggested, sitting
  forward in his chair and squinting to read the numbers written in marker pen
  on the bunnies' thighs. He laughed. A few of them were practicing, trying to
  hone their hopping technique. Some fell over onto the grass and needed the
  handlers to help them to their feet again. 
Despite the amusement of the audience of Master, for the bunnies it was no
  laughing matter. The result of the race determined their fate for the evening.
  The large wooden frames looming over the lawn gave warning of what a poor performance
  in the bunny hop would bring. 
�You see that skinny blonde girl over there?� Alex pointed with an outstretched
  arm. 
�Uh huh,� said Jessica. 
�Can you read the number on her thigh?� 
Jessica lifted her eyes to the heavens in disbelief. She obviously had better
  eyesight than he did. �Eh-ing!� she managed to say through her ball-gag. 
�Eighteen? Thanks. I fancy that one. Quite a good little hopper don't you
  think? Yep. I'll put my money on her.� 
The bunny tripped and fell moments later, causing Alex to curse and Jessica
  to have sudden breathing difficulties. It really wasn't wise to laugh when
  wearing a ballgag. Alex quickly reacted, thinking Jessica was choking. He fumbled
  with the gag straps until she shook her head to indicate she was okay. 
The bookmaker came by with his clipboard while Alex's bunny was still on the
  ground. 
�A thousand dollars on number eighteen,� Alex said with confidence. 
�A thousand? We're paying out each way on four places.� 
Alex barely hesitated. �Okay, make it five!� 
The bookmaker wrote down the details. �So that's forty thousand for a win,
  ten thousand for a place. What about number thirteen? Nobody's bet on her yet.� He
  pointed at a dark-skinned woman, hopping very tentative as if perpetually on
  the verge of falling. It was Lina. Alex agreed to back her with a further five
  thousand. 
Jessica couldn't help feeling a shiver of guilty excitement. Forty thousand
  dollars at stake on a hopping race! 
The hopping bunnies were mustered at a chalk line on the grass while the announcer
  explained over the public address: �The race is over 150 yards - that's 75
  yards out, around the marker post and 75 yards back to the starting line. If
  a bunny falls over she can get up again if she's able, but no outside help
  is permitted. In the case of fallers, final places will be awarded based on
  the distance she has travelled.� 
The announcer had a gun, not a starter's gun but a real revolver. �Get ready!� 
He pointed the gun in the air and fired. 
The bunnies hopped away, some at a desperate racing pace whilst others were
  more cautious. A few collided and brought others down with them, provoking
  some choice language from the bunnies and either laugher or shouts of �get
  up' from their backers. Bound hand and foot, that was easier said than done.
  Only those bunnies prepared to lean on another fallen body managed it. 
Alex's blonde bunny reached the halfway marker post just a few places off
  the front, her hair billowing in the breeze with each jump and looking really
  rather attractive. Alex joined the cacophony of yells as the punters tried
  to spur on their bunny. Jessica was kneeling upright, straining for a better
  view and cursing the ballgag in her mouth. 
Any lingering doubts about the seriousness of this race were dispelled when
  Alex's blonde was on the receiving end of a deliberate shoulder barge from
  another bunny. She hopped a few more times, trying to keep her balance, and
  then fell headlong and dramatically into a flower bed, all but disappearing
  into the flora. 
Alex joined the growing ranks of disappointed punters, but not for long. His
  attention was taken by the dark-skinned bunny making steady progress through
  the depleted field. She was almost smiling. Alex stood up and yelled Lina's
  name, and she appeared to respond. 
Lina stumbled just yards from the finish but somehow collapsed over the line
  in third place. Alex fell back in his seat, breathless with excitement. He
  smiled at Jessica, and kissed her head, instinctively wanting to share the
  joy of his win with somebody. And for that reason he quickly unbuckled the
  straps behind her head. 
Even with the straps hanging free the large red ball was still lodged firmly
  behind Jessica's teeth. Alex carefully prised it from her mouth, and immediately
  kissed her hard on the lips. 
Jessica was cynical; she knew a sport-loving man like Alex would kiss anything,
  even another man, when their team wins at sport. Nonetheless, his kiss was
  good, firm and passionate, and the way he looked at her was even better. She
  returned a closed smile. 
�I don't know what's happened, but you look beautiful today, and it's not
  just the straightjacket.� Alex teased. 
�Perhaps, Sir, it's because all day I've been strapped into a tight harness
  and had to pull a cart like an animal, running at least six miles, and at the
  end of the day I was beaten for not being good enough!� 
That's what Jessica was tempted to say. Instead, having been called beautiful
  while she was embarrassed and ashamed of her cruelly cropped hair, she simply
  looked towards the ground and said �thank you.� 
Imitating the manner of companion slaves, Jessica moved her body so it leant
  against Alex's leg, her cheek pressed to his thigh. He seemed to like it. 
Alex's attention returned to the lawn, where six of the bunny hop losers were
  literally roped into a �best hog-tie' competition. The six master competitors
  had fifteen minutes to use as much or as little rope as they wished to produce
  a hog-tied bunny with rope bondage as beautiful as it was inescapable. 
One man went for classic simplicity with his bunny, in-line wrists and ankles,
  seven loops around each limb and three in the cinches. Two men opted for the
  damsel-in-distress look with elbows, wrists, ankles and knees tied. It was
  a strict tie, particular on the elbows, and produced excellent �wriggle-appeal'
  that they each hoped would seduce the judges. The other three men opted for
  deluxe hog-ties in various styles, including shibari body harnesses and breast
  bondage. 
While the hog-tie competition continued, the other competitors in the bunny
  hop were being dispersed to the other equipment. Alex noticed his disappointing
  and costly blonde hopper being taken to the Torture Garden, where a secluded relief
  zone  had been set up. 
Lina, having done well in the bunny hop was being tied to the dancing
    frame along with four others. Her hands were tied in front and then
    hoisted above her head, and tethered to a high horizontal pole. It wasn't
    an arduous position, providing the bunny didn't mind dancing. 
The music started - a fusion between Turkish cengi and Indian ragas. Nervously,
  the five bunnies in the dancing frame began to feel the rhythm of the music,
  aided by a zealous crop-wielding dance-master. Soon their hips were moving,
  some at the threat of the crop, while others seemed to enjoy dancing and took
  the opportunity to impress. 
Alex's eyes were soon attracted by the sight of naked women dancing, and Lina's
  erotic gyrations and her smile had him spell-bound - she seemed to be able
  to swing her hips from side to side as if they were directly wired to the rhythm
  of the music. After a while all five dancers were swaying and gyrating, each
  learning from her adjacent dancers. 
Jessica, even confined to her straightjacket, enjoyed the music too, whilst
  also being curious about the hog-tie competition just a few yards in front
  of her. Knowing that the bunnies were unwilling participants in these events
  didn't bother her these days. She had gone through the same and worse, and
  in retrospect had to admit that some the experiences were very stimulating. 
To be chained to a master's chair was a privilege. It meant she was free to
  take in the visual spectacle with impunity, knowing that she belonged to a
  master for the evening. With her laced-up labia, and Alex's stated desire for
  her, Jessica felt life had some certainty to it, until at least the following
  morning. 
Alex suddenly kissed Jessica's head, and walked off in the direction of the
  Torture Garden. She studied his rear view as he walked, sharing brief words
  with random people as he went. Jessica was unsure whether she was jealous of
  him, or the people he was talking to. She knew the blonde bunny, the failed
  hopper, was in the Torture Garden and she felt her stomach slowly knotting. 
Alex was doing almost exactly what Jessica expected. Today, having seen Jessica
  in her straightjacket and Lina dancing, he needed relief if he wasn't to spill
  his seed in his pants during the course of the evening. 
One of the handlers was supervising the five bunnies in the relief zone. Alex
  showed him the betting slip. �What can I get for five thousand bucks?� he asked
  with a wry smile. 
The guy frowned, playing along with Alex's joke. �Number eighteen huh? I assume
  you want a little payback. She's over there being worked on by the pussygirl.� 
Five women were fixed at two-metre intervals each fully bent over a leather-topped
  wooden A-frame, their five wriggling asses creating a view to inflame any man.
  Pussygirl Anna was a �fluffer' to the bunnies, making sure they all stayed
  wet and worked-up, ready for men who needed relief, like Alex. Anna was crouched
  behind number 18 with a vibrator against the blonde's clitoris. 
The blonde cried out for mercy - or was it fulfillment - as she reacted to
  pussygirl Anna's expert attention. 
Alex stood over them, raring to go. �Thanks Anna, I'll take it from here.� 
Anna smeared a generous finger of KY jelly over number 18's anus, just in
  case Alex preferred to use that passage. She smiled and curtseyed, then moved
  to the next bunny for more fluffing. 
Alex did use the blonde's rear passage, but not in the way Anna expected.
  He rolled up his betting slip into a tight cigarette shape and pushed it into
  the blonde's anus, leaving just a short stub exposed. 
He stood back a moment and licked his lips, then dropped his pants and plunged
  himself into number 18 ready vagina. The girl tugged vainly against her bondage
  of leather and chains, causing the clatter of padlocks against the wooden frame
  to accompany Alex's exertions. After withdrawal, Alex cleaned his flagging
  penis by wiping it against his partner's buttocks. Then he left her, still
  with the rolled up betting slip protruding from her asshole. 
Alex returned to the lawn, almost dazzled by all the events in progress. Across
  the other side of the lawn, where Jessica sat, the hog-tie competition was
  being judged. Closer to him was the suspension frame. Five bunnies were bound
  and hanging upside down awaiting a full-body birching - their punishment for
  a poor showing in the bunny hop. 
Four bunnies who had performed slightly better in the hopping race were being
  laid out for a game of bunny bags. Men were hammering iron stakes into the
  grass so the bunnies could be spread-eagled between them. There was something
  about the sound of a sledgehammer against the stakes that seemed to heighten
  the anticipation of the game. The tradition was that players themselves would
  hammer in the stakes, while the naked women who were to be stretched between
  them looked on with a dreadful anticipation of their own. Alex, who was due
  to play in one of the later games, stayed a while to help. 
As soon as the first four stakes were hammered into place, the first reluctant
  bunny was prodded into position between them. Her hands were released from
  her steel hand cuffs, only to have separate ropes immediately wrapped around
  each limb. They laid her out on the ground and with one man kneeling at each
  stake pulling her wrists and ankles to their respective stake like a four-way
  tug-of-war. Only when the girl was gasping with strain did Alex, Vince and
  the other men tie off their ropes. It wouldn't take long to have the next three
  bunnies staked out side by side, each of them sharing two stakes with her neighbour. 
While Alex was staking out bunnies, the sensual rhythmic music of the dance
  competition played through the public address, and those tied to the dancing
  frame continued to gyrate in the hope their performance would bring reward
  or some kind of favour from the onlookers. 
The music fell silent just as the fourth bunny was being staked out. After
  confirming the start time of his game, Alex visited the other recipient of
  his bunny hop wager. 
The five dancers stood, hands tied high over their heads, recovering their
  breath. Lina smiled as Alex approached. 
�You're a good dancer.� 
Lina looked up coyly. �Thank you, Sir. I enjoyed myself. It's been such a
  long time since I danced.� 
Her hips were made, not just for swaying to the music, but for a man's hands
  and eyes to rest upon. Alex kissed her lightly on the lips, feeling a tingle
  of pleasure which she shared. �Perhaps you could dance privately for me sometime?� 
She glanced downwards but Alex detected a smile. �Sir, I would like that very
  much. Tonight?� 
He chuckled. It felt like they were making a date. �I'm busy tonight, but
  soon I hope.� 
Lina looked across the lawn to where Jessica sat. �She's very beautiful, even
  with such short hair. I believe she has a gentle and yet powerful spirit. A
  person of honesty and loyalty.� 
The first part of Lina's comment was self-evident, at least to Alex. The second
  part made him pause. Lina was a perceptive woman. Enough for her words to cause
  him a little discomfort. 
He kissed her again, and this time their lips lingered, each seemed to be
  tempting the other with more. 
Before returning to his seat Alex collected a glass of chilled white wine
  and plate from the buffet. 
�I feel better now,� Alex said as he sat down, �you're not driving me quite
  so crazy.� 
Jessica said nothing. 
�Sip of wine?� 
The glass was offered to her lips. Jessica sipped and quietly thanked him. 
�You seem subdued. Anything wrong?� 
�I'm a prisoner on an island. I'm strapped up in a very tight straight-jacket
  and fastened to a chair by a heavy chain. Why should anything be wrong?� 
Her sarcasm, however, had long since lost its impact on Alex. He chuckled
  and kissed her head. �You in that straightjacket and chained to my chair feels
  very right to me!� He took a large gulp of wine. �See the dark-skinned dancer
  over there?� 
�The one you were talking to? The dancer. Who is she?� 
�She's called Lina. You met her a year ago. Remember when you escaped and
  ended up in a police station? She was one of those who was punished with you.� 
Jessica studied her for a moment. �Yes, I remember her now. I think she was
  a prostitute.� 
�You're wrong. She was in prison, punished for not believing in God. She used
  to be a teacher. When your friend Nancy escaped, she landed up in the same
  police station as Lina, and because her papers were in order, or rather the
  ones she stole from Karen, Nancy was allowed to continue her journey. In fact
  the police were so helpful they offered her a ride to the capital because they
  were transferring Lina to their prison at the same time.� 
�For not believing in God?� 
�That's right, although her crime was exacerbated by her being a teacher.
  While Nancy and Lina were being driven to the capital, their car was hijacked
  by kidnappers who took them to a jungle hideaway. They thought they'd get a
  ransom for Nancy, but then they discovered out the passport wasn't hers.� 
�So how did they escape from the kidnappers?� 
�They didn't. The kidnappers contacted the Island. We paid the ransom, and
  Vince and I brought them back here. Do you know something else? She doesn't
  have a clitoris after being circumcised as a child. Apparently it's a custom
  in these parts.� 
Jessica winced, unsure whether Alex was trying to spook her. They were interrupted
  by Carol, who seemed in high spirits. Alex rose politely to greet her. 
�Hello Sir. Hello Jessica. I love the straightjacket!� 
Jessica gave a reluctant smile by way of reply. 
�Hi Carol. Having fun?� asked Alex. 
�Yes I am,� she said emphatically. �Thanks to what you did to me today. Oh
  my god, Sir, you really know how to treat a woman. If I can do anything to
  return the favour...� 
He shrugged modestly. �It's my pleasure Carol. Any time.� 
She gave him a brief affectionate kiss on the lips and then moved on, not
  wanting to outstay her welcome. 
Alex's continued explanation to Jessica on the matter of Lina's circumcision
  was curtailed by a tap on his shoulder. His game of bunny bags was about to
  commence. 
For the next twenty minutes Jessica was alone, watching the bizarre events
  like an invisible spectator. The first, second and third places in the hog-tie
  competition lay mostly ignored in front of her. The three bunnies had long
  since been defeated by their award-winning bonds. They still struggled and
  writhed a little, but mainly out of self-pity and frustration. 
The centre of the lawn had been taken over by the precision caning competition.
  Five women, bent and fastened over wooden A-frames were having their buttocks
  and thighs marked. Each carefully considered strike of the cane designed to
  etch the skin with a perfect red line parallel to the line caused by the previous
  strike. Jessica found herself becoming aroused by the cries that followed each
  blow. It was one thing to be beaten, but quite another to be decorated as an
  artist would a canvas, and then to carry the evidence of that perfect beating
  for several days afterwards. She would have gladly swapped places at that moment.
  Better to be the recipient of a sadist's cane than publicly humiliated by Master
  Alex. 
Alex returned to his seat, his wine glass refreshed. 
�What's wrong?� He asked Jessica. 
�Nothing, Sir.� 
�You seem a little pensive.� 
�Just thinking, Sir.� 
�Wine?� He offered the class to her lips. 
She shook her head. 
�If you don't tell me what's wrong I'll have you punished.� 
�Too busy to do it yourself?� Jessica muttered. 
Alex laughed, loud enough for those standing nearby to turn and stare. �Feeling
  neglected? Or perhaps jealous?� 
Jessica rolled her eyes in disdain. 
�Strike two,� said Alex. 
�Jealous? Of you? You're a Master. I'm just a mad ponygirl. I know my place.� 
Alex shook his head sorrowfully. Jessica had used up her generous sarcasm
  allowance. �You've struck out!� He raised his arm to signal to Erik who was
  standing nearby. 
Erik came over. Alex whispered an instruction to him. He nodded to indicate
  he understood, then bent down to unclip Jessica's collar from his chair. He
  helped Jessica to her feet. 
�No!� Jessica cried softly like a spoilt child as she was led away. It wasn't
  supposed to be like this tonight.

*** 
Alex passed several hours at the Bunny Hop festival before returning to his
  room mid-evening. He brought back a companion. Lina's swaying hips had worked
  their magic on him. She was dressed how Alex preferred his women - naked except
  for a slave collar and hands neatly roped behind her. 
His bedroom suite was in darkness, save for the ghostly reflection of the
  night sky on a wall mirror. Alex made Lina stand to wait in the middle of the
  room while he went to the bathroom. She giggled to herself, hearing him humming
  a tune as a splash sounded from the toilet bowl. Then, sensing Alex's imminent
  return and what would surely follow, she had the urge to check herself in the
  mirror. Moving toward the moonlit mirror she kicked something soft. 
She recoiled, and in the gloom barely made out somebody sitting on the floor.
  The toilet flushed and Alex entered the bedroom, turning on the main light. 
Lina looked warily between Alex and the hooded and bound woman on the floor,
  wondering what kind of game she had been ensnared into. 
�Don't worry about her,� Alex said dismissively, �she's here to learn.� 
�What can she learn like that?� Lina asked. 
Alex pushed Lina hard against the bed post at the foot of his four-poster. �The
  cost of her jealousy.� With practiced ease and a compliant victim he soon had
  Lina re-tied with her hands above her head with her back resting against the
  bed post. 
Jessica was fixed into the falcon position exactly as she had been the previous
  evening. Alex knelt down in front of her to inspect her bondage. It was every
  bit as tight as he expected: the hood, with only a hole for her nose, the belts
  keeping each leg folded under itself, and of course the red rope rising from
  the floor and threading through her labia and nipple rings. It was, Alex thought,
  a fine way to subdue a jealous ponygirl. 
As Jessica took each deliberate nasal breath the rise of her chest cavity
  caused the intimate rope to tug on her nipples, reminding her that not even
  her breathing was free. 
Lina swayed her hips and hummed a passable version of the tune she'd earlier
  been dancing to. Alex turned around and smiled at her. It felt good to be seduced
  like that, and already aroused by Jessica's state of submission, he undressed
  as Lina continued to dance and hum. 
�Your skin matches the colour of the wood. I think I might keep you permanently
  chained to my bed post,� Alex joked. 
�I don't mind,� said Lina coyly. 
�You'd have to be taken away sometimes, for bathroom visits and to keep you
  smelling as nice as you do now.� 
�And will you make love to me every night, Sir?� 
Alex nodded thoughtfully. �I think I probably would.� 
Lina's dance turned to an anticipatory squirm as Alex pressed his body against
  hers. He found her body as soft and warm as her face. She squealed as he entered
  her, his erection lifting her onto her toes as he did so. Her bound hands,
  tied about her head, made involuntary random shapes like a kind of erotic sign
  language. On the brief moments when Alex pulled his lips away from hers she
  audibly gasped for breath as if surfacing from water. 
For Lina, it was almost perfect, but how could Lina tell him she also liked
  to feel coarse rope biting around her ankles? Perhaps he might do that next
  time, she hoped. Alex grunted quietly, like a gentleman, as he came. and stayed
  inside her, enjoying the sensuous union of her soft and warm body against his.
  That was when he heard the tinkling of bells two yards behind him. 
Jessica had tried to sit still, but just couldn't. She imagined it was her
  tied to the bed post instead of Lina, as indeed it was supposed to be before
  Master Alex's fit of pique. 
�No, please don't do that!� Lina begged desperately. 
Alex had picked a light cane from a drawer, glaring at Jessica. He smacked
  it firmly against his hand to gauge its weight. 
Lina repeated her plea, but it was too late. Alex swung the cane with full
  force against the top of both Jessica's breasts, two inches above the nipples.
  A whoosh of the cane was followed by a sickening thud as it met Jessica's flesh.
  Alex had no need or desire to deliver further blows. 
The sudden terrible pain on her breasts felt like violence rather than punishment.
  Jessica became enraged, her whole body erupted beyond the point her bonds allowed,
  as if engaged in mortal combat with the metal, rope and leather of the falcon
  position. 
Lina started to sob. �Stop her. She's going to get hurt!� 
Alex could only stand back, biting his lip, as he waited for Jessica's temper
  to subside. The tightly laced hood, with its built-in rubber gag rendered her
  attempts at shouting incomprehensible. 
Defeated by her inability to take in enough air, Jessica's shouting and her
  struggles gradually subsided; although, Alex observed, the heavy red mark running
  across both breasts seemed only to get more pronounced. 
Finally Jessica's head dropped until her sturdy collar dug into her chin,
  and she slumped forward as if in a faint. 
Just as Alex was about to relent and pull off her hood Jessica began to sob,
  her chest palpitating with each staccato outburst of her breath. 
Lina gazed down piteously; her face glistening with her own tears. She glared
  angrily at Alex, but felt some pity for him too. His naked body was the least
  of what he'd revealed to her that evening. 
Alex picked up the telephone handset that hung on the wall beside his bed. �Erik?
  Can you collect the ponygirl from my room as soon as you can.� Erik queried
  something, and then Alex spoke again. �No, I don't mind what you do with her.
  The torture garden would be fine.� 
Appearing flustered, Alex hurriedly pulled on a polo shirt, shorts and sandals
  and muttered �I'm going for a drink,� as he walked out of his bedroom. 
A half hour later he returned to his room - fortified and calmed by a couple
  of generous measures of Glenlivet at the bar. Jessica was gone. Erik had taken
  her as requested. 
Lina was still standing tied to the bedpost. She was trembling. Alex just
  sat on the edge of the bed with his head in his hands. After a silent ten minutes,
  he released her from the bedpost and took her to bed. After binding her hands
  and feet, they neither talked nor even touched, and were soon asleep. 
*** 
The next night, Jessica was again in Alex's room, and again secured in the
  falcon position. She hated this recurring torment, particularly having experienced
  Alex at his most loving one night, and cruel the next. Although having been
  hooded before leaving the ponygirl quarters, Jessica could sense Alex's room
  by the barest hint of his deodorant in her nostrils, and for the first time
  ever, the delicate smell made her fear what might be in store for her. 
Alex arrived, and from the muffled sound through the leather hood Jessica
  could tell he had somebody with him. She prayed it wasn't Lina again. 
It was a bunny - a blonde girl Jessica would have recognised had she had the
  privilege of sight. 
�Kneel on the floor, head down, and wait!� Master Alex commanded gruffly. 
The girl, with her arms crossed behind her in a Japanese rope harness, did
  exactly as she was told. While Alex went to the bathroom, she glanced briefly
  at Jessica, but there wasn't much to see; just another falcon. She'd seen them
  before. They just knelt, passive and anonymous, like ornaments. This one, she
  observed, had a horizontal welt etched on top of each breast, evidently the
  result of a single harsh blow. She might have been surprised to know it was
  inflicted by the man of this room, having been on the Island long enough to
  learn that Alex was far from being the cruellest master. 
The toilet flushed, signalling the end of Alex's necessary ablutions. The
  blonde touched her head to the floor to await his command. Alex grabbed the
  intersection of several ropes on the girl's back, pulling her to an upright
  position. She turned her head, noticing he was naked. She took in the lean,
  slightly pale body, quite adequate for a man in his fifties, settling on his
  crotch and his semi erect penis. 
�Turn around!� Alex said, almost amused that her eyes would dwell on him like
  that. 
He stroked her thick sun-bleached hair, which had been plaited and tied to
  the other ropes at her back. Alex enjoyed the symbolism: a woman bound by her
  own crowning glory. She should be grateful that such a binding were possible,
  he mused, thinking of Jessica's cruelly shorn head beneath that leather hood. 
�Stick your tongue out!� 
She did so, and Alex - standing behind and leaning over her - could verify
  for himself that what others said about her was true. Her tongue was the longest
  he'd seen in quite some time. Its length was broken up by a large steel barbell
  pierced one inch from the tip. Although the Island inflicted a variety of piercings
  on its bunnies, whether for usefulness - such as pony piercings - punishment,
  or to add a particular attraction, this piercing came with the girl, so to
  speak. Alex was amused that the blonde had decided to have her tongue pierced
  when no other part of her body was so adorned. 
�Open,� Alex said offering a ring-gag to her lips. He wedged it behind her
  teeth and buckled the retaining straps around and over her head. �That looks
  good on you,� he added when securing the chin strap. Harness gags always looked
  better on blondes, Alex felt. 
The bunny become aroused merely from Alex stroking her leather-strapped head
  with his hand. He kissed her on the top of the head, kissing the leather strap
  as much as he did her hair. Alex chuckled to himself, recollecting how he pushed
  his betting slip in her anus the day before. 
�Spread your legs and lean forward, slut,� he instructed his kneeling slave
  as he reached into his toy drawer, �time for some good vibrations.� 
Alex switched on the vibrator, allowing its humming sound to fill the air
  as a prelude. The slut's anticipation seemed to grow merely from the sound
  of it. Alex bent down behind her and pressed it against her labia, gradually
  letting it find its own way to her clitoris. His objective was teasing, not
  torture, so he modified his movement based on her reactions. It was easy to
  gauge. His left hand resting on her back had been gripped by her bound hands,
  as if holding on to him for life. 
His cock grew to fullness, poised barely a foot away from her entrance. He
  paused the vibrator, sensing the blonde was rapidly approaching her climax.
  Suddenly he tugged on her plaited hair, forcing her sitting upright. He moved
  himself in front of her and pushed his erect cock into her ring-gagged mouth,
  pulling her head harshly back and forward several times. Gasping and dribbling,
  her blue eyes dancing wild and distracted, she was highly aroused by such treatment
  and needed no further encouragement to work his penis. 
A few feet to his left was Jessica, not exactly moving, but trembling; yet
  not enough to cause her nipple bells to ring. Her skin was flushed red, Alex
  noticed as he pulled his straining cock from the blonde's mouth. 
He gripped his penis tightly in his right hand, aimed it at Jessica's collared
  neck, and spurted. 
A string of semen was splattered down her leather-covered face. More landed
  on her shoulder, both breasts, and onto her thighs. After taking a few long
  deep breaths, he returned his penis to the blonde's mouth with a gruff instruction. �Clean
  it!� 
Alex sat on his bed and gazed at Jessica as an artist might scrutinise his
  most recent strokes upon a canvas. Between them sat the bound and confused
  blonde, disappointed that she hadn't been the object of Alex's ejaculate. 
Finally Alex spoke to the blonde. �Now you can clean her.� 
He watched intently as the blonde shuffled the few feet across the floor to
  Jessica. She licked tentatively at the semen spattered leather hood, her licking
  made awkward by the ring gag, but her long and agile tongue served her well.
  She didn't require further instruction or correction as she moved to Jessica's
  shoulder, her first physical contact with this seemingly impassive ponygirl. 
She reached Jessica's breasts. Both needed cleaning. Tenderly she dabbed her
  tongue against the spillage of semen that had intersected with the horizontal
  welt across the breast. She felt she was licking the ponygirl's wounds as much
  as giving a erotic display of submission to this enigmatic master. 
Jessica gave a throaty groan of resistance, fearing she was being provoked,
  but the blonde continued to lick, moving down to the nipple, gratuitously teasing
  this substantial and erect ringed nub, circling and then flicking it upwards,
  causing the nipple bell to ring. Behind her, Alex had moved for a better view,
  now sitting at the foot of the bed and leaning forward in rapt attention. 
�And the other breast,� said Alex unnecessarily, perhaps just to remind the
  girl of his presence. 
She moved as requested, but not before attempting to remove a small glob which
  had landed on the knotted rope linking Jessica's breasts. 
Her tongue reached Jessica's inner thigh to clean the last spillage of Alex's
  cum. She looked up at him, noticing that he seemed pleased with her display,
  and evidently aroused by it too. Her reward was to be roped in a very tight
  spread-eagled position on his bed, for the purpose of a vigorous uncomplicated
  mating. 
That night Erik removed Jessica and the blonde from the room so that Alex
  could sleep alone. 
CLEARING UP 
Alex was packing boxes in his office when he heard a knock, tentative yet
  familiar, at the door. 
Carol entered upon hearing his permission. She behaved with her usual coyness
  which belied her intimate friendship with Alex; and she had her usual intensity
  too, something that seemed to give gravity to the most mundane of conversations. 
Alex smiled, surprising even himself. 
�You think I look alright?� Carol asked, her hands held up at her sides like
  wings. 
She was dressed in black leather trousers, so shiny it might have been mistaken
  for latex. The silhouette of a black pushup bra showed provocatively beneath
  her silky white blouse. High heels and a slim red leather collar completed
  her sexy ensemble, with its hints of both dominance and submissiveness. It
  was a vast improvement on Carol's usual wardrobe of shorts, tee shirts and
  summer dresses. 
�It was the committee's idea,� she said apologetically, �they think I should
  appear more dominant when I'm working with the bunnies.� She fingered the half-inch
  wide collar snug about her neck, �it's permanent. Look, you can't even see
  a join.� 
Alex already knew of these infinity collars, with their seamless interlocking
  ends. Once snapped together the joint was almost invisible, and there was no
  evident means of unlocking it. Within the leather were layers of thin steel
  to repel attempts to cut through the collar. 
Then Carol fingered the two-inch hoop earrings she wore. �And these are permanent
  too,� she frowned, �they fixed them on me this afternoon.� 
�You look nice,� said Alex honestly, �very cute.� Very cute indeed for a forty-year-old,
  he thought. 
In fact, he regretted that she hadn't dressed like that before. As a retired
  companion slave, with little need or desire for men, Carol was reluctant to
  dress provocatively, much to the dismay of the Island's committee members.
  For reasons unknown to Alex she had finally relented to their demands. He liked
  the result, particularly her shapely buttocks in the leather trousers. 
�Still packing?� 
Alex sighed, forbidding himself the temptation of a sarcastic reply as he
  placed a heavy textbook into an archive box. He looked up at the empty bookshelves
  above the desk. �I had no idea I'd accumulated so many books here.� 
�Got room in your box for a stowaway?� Carol asked, almost whispering. 
Alex hmmm'd, knowing where the conversation was leading. �She can't hear you.
  I've had her ears plugged.� 
Carol looked down to her side at Jessica, kneeling in the falcon position
  for the fourth consecutive evening. Jessica had the same hood, the same handcuffs
  and the same roping of her pony piercings, and now she was deaf as well as
  blind, mute and immobile. 
�Still not cured her of jealousy?� 
Alex smiled. �I think the last three nights would have done it.� 
�She has to want to be cured!� said Carol with a wag of her finger. �For some
  bizarre reason this poor thing likes you. Is that so terrible?� 
Alex sighed, as if irritated with the line of questioning. �Let's just say
  it's unhelpful. She needs to rid herself of such notions. Tomorrow I'll be
  leaving the island for six months. Soon after that she'll be freed, and back
  into her own life with all memories of this experienced wiped from her mind. � 
Carol was taken aback by Alex's annoyance. �I feel guilty. She thought we
  were lovers. My requesting that you tie me to a frame, beat me hard and vibrate
  me is hardly a relationship. We're just friends. Why didn't you just explain
  that we've never been lovers?� 
�A Master doesn't explain himself to his slave.� 
Carol smiled, and let Alex's Freudian slip pass without comment. 
When Alex returned his attention to packing the last of his books, Carol knelt
  down in front of Jessica and began running her fingernails over Jessica's most
  tender places, her inner thighs, her breasts, her belly. It was fun, Carol
  thought, teasing this beautiful and beautifully restrained body and watching
  how it began to respond. 
�You have a pretty nose,� Carol said to Jessica. It seemed to twitch, perhaps
  in response to Carol's scent rather than her words. Her fingers continued to
  provoke Jessica's body, encouraged by the slightest movements. Then Jessica
  leant forward slightly, placing her breasts in Carol's hands to be further
  teased and squeezed. Carol giggled as her fingernails continued to arouse Jessica's
  flesh. Inevitably Jessica's nipple bells jingled as Carol massaged her breasts. �I
  bet I can make you come,� she whispered to Jessica. 
�Stop it, � Alex interrupted, �the falcon position is for decoration, not
  for sex acts.� 
�Aw, come on, sir. Who's going to know?� Carol asked. 
�Everybody... given the ponygirls' tendency to gossip. Have you heard how
  they talk when they're sitting at the table polishing the harnesses? Sometimes
  I think they know more about this Island than we do!� 
Reluctantly Carol obeyed, leaving Jessica slightly agitated and confused by
  her treatment. �Perhaps I'll see you in the bar for a nightcap?� she asked
  hopefully. 
�In half an hour,� Alex reassured her as she left. He finished packing shortly
  after Carol's departure, and then with nothing else in the room to distract
  him, turned his attention to Jessica. 
�Carol's right. Who's going to know?� Alex sighed. �Besides, after last night
  I owe you one!� 
He knelt in front of her, reaching out to grip her breasts. Jessica couldn't
  possibly fail to notice the difference between Carol's and Alex's touch. He
  repeatedly squeezed her breasts knowing she liked that. The rope linking her
  nipples and labia to the floor hindered the progress of Alex's hands and yet
  the awkward progress of his hands against her rope-linked treasures seemed
  to arouse them both. Even though Jessica's labia were linked and laced with
  red rope Alex managed to insert two fingers into her moist sex. 
�You like this, don't you Jessica?� Alex teased. �Being tied up and helpless.
  Being forced to come. Unable to make any choices for yourself.� 
Jessica groaned, as if in agreement with his statement. 
Alex's fingers continued to work deep within her. �Come for me, Jessica.� 
She groaned again and her nasal breathing became faster and shallower. Her
  body was warm, almost hot, and seemed to tense and twitch. That was what Alex
  liked, a woman tugging against her bonds and the resulting muscular tension
  heightening the intensity of her orgasm. 
Jessica came with a gentle shudder and a languorous muffled sigh which left
  Alex in no doubt of his success. 
He cleaned her perspiring skin with a handkerchief, musing on the fact that
  their final contact for many months, should have been for Jessica's pleasure
  rather than his own.

The following morning a Sea King helicopter landed in the corral, the deafening
  noise of the rotors shattering the island's peace, until it too fell silent
  and tranquillity was restored. 
Two ponygirl carts approached it, each hauling trailers laden with the luggage
  of several departing guests. 
Frank and Bruce helped load the boxes from the trailer into the side bay of
  the helicopter, while Alex and a couple of guests said their parting words
  to those bidding them farewell. 
Vince and Dr. Schmidt were there to see Alex off. The doctor was sad at losing
  his intellectual companion and occasional chess opponent, while Vince was losing
  the man he felt a duty to protect. He rather enjoyed being Alex's sidekick
  and self-styled �henchman'. 
But their feelings were nothing compared to ponygirl Jessica who stood motionless
  in her tight ponygirl harness, unsighted by her position but at least able
  to hear the conversation, and Alex's last words to Frank before he boarded
  the helicopter were unmistakable: 
�Take good care of the ponygirls, won't you?�

Chapter 31. Jessica's Desire 
(Even Ponygirls Sometimes Get the Blues, by Aurelius) 
The story so far: 
(Ch. 26) Rude food. 
(Ch. 27) The Ponygirl exercise program. A wedding. Kate is auctioned. Riccardo
  wins. 
(Ch. 28) The falcon position. 
(Ch. 29) Jessica's madness, jealousy and punishment. 
(Ch. 30) A cure for jealousy. Alex departs Rabbit Island. 
The journey from New York to a remote island in the South Seas never seemed
  to get any shorter for Alex, and this time, having being away from Rabbit Island
  for six months, it felt longer than ever. 
He was seated next to an elegant forty-year-old French woman in business class,
  all the way from New York to Bangkok. Charming and sexy she certainly was,
  but Alex had concluded that Madame Marie Dupont was not sexually submissive.
  That wasn't to say that he didn't find her attractive. 
Sitting next to somebody for hours on end, watching them talk, eat, drink,
  read and sleep, one can feel an attraction, or at least a human intimacy with
  almost anyone. Alex preferred Marie when she slept, when he could read in peace,
  and enjoy the sight of the gentle rise and fall of her shapely sweater-covered
  breasts. He mused on whether she might wish to join him in the mile-high club.
  It's remarkably easy to engineer a conversation in that direction and to elicit
  an answer without actually having to ask the question. He'd done it before,
  but alas not for ten years, he thought wistfully. 
It so happened that Madame Dupont propositioned Alex shortly before landing
  in Bangkok. Clearly she had used the previous hours as a kind of dating audition.
  With two days of business meetings and two nights to occupy her in Bangkok,
  Alex seemed a pretty good catch - a gentleman, well mannered, and able to hold
  his drink. She preferred younger and fitter men but was prepared to make an
  exception. 
But Alex had other plans in Bangkok - meetings with professionals in his specialist
  field, he explained by way of apology to Madame Dupont. She assumed he was
  referring to psychiatry as Alex had neglected to mention his other specialisation
  in slave trading. 
*** 
Charlie's slave depot had changed location again, although still within the
  environs of Bangkok. A wealthy businessman had provided him with secure basement
  accommodation in a secluded mansion. The rental terms were good - consisting
  merely of payment in kind. Alex had been concerned that Charlie should be dependent
  on somebody else's hospitality, but upon seeing the mansion for the first time,
  his doubts evaporated. The owner, a steelworks tycoon, was at home at the time,
  and immediately offered Alex overnight hospitality of considerably more luxury
  than Charlie's caged slaves enjoyed in the basement. 
Alex always enjoyed his inspection of Charlie's current slaves, together with
  the stories of how they had come to be acquired. 
�Brazilian!� said Charlie, pointing at two cages, both occupied by pouting,
  big-breasted beauties who seemed sullen and resigned to their fate. They both
  sat up straight in their cages, thrusting their breasts upwards as if inviting
  Alex to touch them. Their hands were fastened in steel cuffs behind them, and
  around their necks each wore a dog collar, the leash of which was wrapped around
  the top bars of the metre-high cage, obliging them to sit upright and at attention. 
�Noite boa! Como &eacute; voc&ecirc;?� said Alex. 
They smiled nervously, thrilled at hearing their own language, their bright
  searching eyes met his, wondering if Alex was their saviour or merely their
  next owner. They were disappointed to learn that he was nothing more than a
  casual visitor. 
Several Asian women occupied the next few cages. �Korean, Thai, Vietnamese!� said
  Charlie, proud of his varied menu. They only looked up at Alex because it was
  Charlie's instruction, otherwise they hung their heads, depressed, subdued
  and without hope. 
�Quite young,� observed Alex, although with smaller breasts the age of younger
  Asian women could be deceptive. 
�You want one for Rabbit Island?� Charlie asked hopefully. �Maybe two?� 
Alex pondered, his thoughts occupied with the Thai girl he'd just inspected,
  and the possibility of taking her to his bed. �I'll phone them tonight to ask
  if they're buying.� 
They reached the last of the six cages, occupied by a pale-skinned woman with
  a black cotton hood over her head. 
�This one trouble!� Charlie pronounced with a foreboding shake of his head.
  He liked obedient women who sat quietly in their cages until sold. His hand
  reached into the cage to pull off her loose-fitting hood. The woman shook her
  full-bodied corn-blonde hair from her eyes. 
�Please, you have to get me out of here,� she begged Alex, even though she
  must have heard the preceding conversation. 
Charlie rapped on her cage with his crop. �No talk!� She twisted angrily in
  her cage, glaring up at Charlie as if he were her mortal enemy. Alex enjoyed
  this girl's spirit and passion. 
�New Zealander?� he asked. 
She nodded. 
�Backpacker?� 
She nodded again. 
�Got more adventure than you bargained for, haven't you?� Alex stated with
  a sympathetic smile. 
Her eyes welled up with tears. 
She looked good in a cage, Alex thought. The wild ones usually did. 
Horribly jet-lagged, Alex took nobody to his bed that night, retiring exhausted
  immediately after supper with his new-found friend, the Thai steel magnate. 
*** 
Alex was wrong. The journey from New York to Rabbit Island may have felt long
  but had actually got shorter, thanks to the Island committee's decision to
  purchase a helicopter for the purpose of transfers from the airport. It did
  periodically disrupt the tranquillity of the island, but the saving of several
  hours by road and boat was a price worth paying to the weary traveller. 
One Rabbit Island tradition remained. A pair of ponygirls in their ceremonial
  splendour stood to attention awaiting the helicopter's passengers as it did
  for the boat's. Alex smiled from the helicopter as he looked down to see the
  ponygirls' plumes being blown by the helicopter's down draft. He was content
  to allow his fellow passenger - a stranger up until that journey - the chance
  to ride with Bruce and his ponygirls. Alex gladly took the five minute stroll
  to the Lodge, revelling in the island's blissful silence, the clean air, the
  fragrant tropical plants; things he had latterly appreciated about the Island
  as much as its erotic slavery. 
In the front lobby of the Lodge pussygirl Anna was acting as receptionist,
  greeting Alex from behind a newly installed marble counter. He felt strange
  having to be checked in like any other visitor. 
There were subtle changes to the decor, he noticed. The pale colours on the
  walls and the erotic artwork looked striking, and he had to admit they'd done
  a good job without him. 
One artwork in particular attracted Alex's attention. On a low plinth was
  a white plaster statue of a kneeling woman with her knees spread and hands
  placed palms up on her thighs. It wasn't an exceptional piece in itself, but
  there was something intriguing about it. He realised what that was when the
  statue's eyes moved. Pale blue eyes followed him as he passed in front of her.
  He walked around the living statue looking for a join, but found it to be seamless,
  as if she had been coated in plaster and left to dry. 
Alex had once visited a slave collector in Italy who had done that very thing,
  creating a replica of the �three graces' using three Japanese teenagers he
  had acquired the previous week. He thought back to that incident, and the fact
  that those slaves almost died from dehydration after two days. 
�It's a mould,� pussygirl Anna explained. �It's made in several pieces and
  then fixed together around her while she is sedated. Then it takes an hour
  to fill and paint over the joints. She can stay that way for a whole day. You
  don't recognise her, do you?� 
Alex studied the breasts. They were on the small side, but shapely and with
  prominent upturned nipples. �Lucy?� 
�You've got it! Tomorrow it's my turn again.� Anna said, seemingly not too
  upset about spending day in plaster. �I kinda enjoy doing it. It's like being
  invisible, watching people come and go, talking about me while I'm totally
  encased and unable to move.� 
Anna's enthusiasm surprised even Alex. After all, she had come to the Island
  as a prisoner two years ago. His theories o the proper training and rewarding
  of natural submissives, were beginning to bear fruit with the likes of Anna
  and Lucy. 
�Any ponygirls available this evening?� asked Alex. (It was wise to book your
  private entertainment in advance during busy periods.) 
Anna consulted a large ledger book. �Sorry, they're all booked tonight, but
  I can get a bunny brought up from one of the camps for you.� 
Alex declined the offer, indicating that he would take a self-service option
  if he found himself in the mood. 
�While your room is being prepared, perhaps you'd like to visit the blonde
  girl in the O-Box?� Anna suggested, her green eyes gazing intently at him,
  making Alex wonder if she was working on commission. �Go through the door at
  the end of the gallery.� 
It wasn't a bad idea, Alex thought. A relaxing expert blowjob would be welcome
  after a day travelling. He had missed the peculiar thrill of the O-box in the
  intervening six months. 
The neat wooden plaque on the door read: �O-Box, please book at reception.� It
  was a small windowless room, carpeted and decorated with red and gold wall-hung
  rugs that reminded Alex of a New England fall. In the opposite corner of the
  room a small drinks cabinet with an ice bucket and a selection of glasses on
  top called out to Alex's thirst. 
In the centre of the room was the O-Box, complete with blonde as promised.
  She was facing away from the door, her head protruding from the polished wooden
  case - her prison and his seat. Alex noticed her hair, cut square at the shoulder,
  and the type of blonde that would inflame any man. His cock instantly stirred,
  but first he needed to fix himself a gin and tonic from the bar. 
First there was the �plink plink' of two ice cubes, a small measure of gin,
  and then the olfactory delight as tonic splashed on the gin sending out a distinctive
  juniper aroma. Alex took a sip as he turned around to face the girl in the
  O-box, then coughed as the much anticipated drink went down the wrong hole. 
She just smiled. �Welcome back, Sir.� 
Alex continued to cough, until he was finally able to take a much needed drink. 
�Thank you Jessica. It's good to be back. I didn't recognise you at first.� 
He liked Jessica's new appearance, all the more for knowing that she was somehow
  humiliated by it. �You look nice,� he said, glad to have a topic of conversation, �but
  I prefer you as a natural fiery brunette.� 
One thing Alex liked about the O-box was that the occupant's face was always
  beautifully and sexily made up. It was vital, bearing in mind that everything
  below her collar was hidden from view in the box. Jessica's eyes looked larger
  and brighter, and her lips more luscious than he remembered. Somebody had gone
  to considerable effort working on Jessica's face, and that was Carol, Alex
  assumed. 
Jessica was biting her lip. �You're not angry, are you?� she asked. 
�That I've been set up like this?� 
She nodded. 
�No, I suppose not. Although somebody will be punished for it.� 
Jessica watched nervously as Alex unbuckled his belt and pulled down his trousers.
  Often, the men using the O-box just unzipped their flies and pulled out their
  tackle, but Jessica preferred it when they took off their trousers first. 
Alex sat astride the wooden case so Jessica's head was between his spread
  knees. He slipped his feet through the rope loops near the bottom of either
  side of the case and instantly the slack disappeared holding his legs in place.
  Alex showed little sign of concern as he slipped his penis and balls through
  a rope loop on top of a one-inch block. Again, the rope went tight. 
Jessica swallowed nervously, waiting for the moment when Alex inserted his
  own wrists into the loops at the top sides of the case. As soon as he did so
  Jessica's hands pulled the cords that lay within easy reach of her fingers,
  looping them over a conveniently placed hook fixed to the inner wall of the
  box. 
He was her prisoner, trapped by cords she controlled, and with his penis within
  biting distance, and growing closer to her lips of its own accord. And yet
  he wasn't acting like a prisoner. He seemed as relaxed as any O-box visitor
  she'd ever had. Jessica opened her lips and craned her neck forward, compelled
  to take the glistening cock in her mouth as she had been trained. 
�There's something I want to say,� Jessica said quietly, not daring to look
  up. Then she moved her cheek against the side of Alex's cock, feeling its spring-like
  resistance in the straining flesh, and then she repeated it on her other cheek.
  She made it feel like a kiss or a caress, symbolising perhaps that his cock
  was more than just something to be sucked. 
�What did you want to say?� Alex asked. 
Jessica replied: �I've just said it,� and then opened her lips wide to engulf
  him, to take him as fully in her mouth as she could. Alex did what all men
  did at that point - started thrusting his hips. The undeniable tug against
  the imprisonment at the base of his cock did at least half the work. All Jessica
  had to do was feast upon him as she had been trained, as if a man's semen was
  the very stuff of life. 
Master Alex came with a shudder and groan, and slave Jessica swallowed and
  licked him clean; a formality accepted without question by both of them. 
Then there was silence and stillness. Usually the O-girl released the tension
  in the loops at that point so the man extricate himself, as there was no reason
  to detain a post-coital man on the O-box longer than necessary. But Jessica
  just stared sullenly at Alex's belly as if in a trance, waiting for him to
  become restless, mentally willing him to tug on his temporary bondage, to feel
  the helplessness that she so often felt. 
For more than two minutes Jessica waited for a reaction that never came. Alex
  just looked patiently down at her until he felt the loops around his penis,
  wrists and ankles finally become slack. 
�I suppose I should punish you for that,� he said casually whilst putting
  on his trousers. Then he left the room, saying: �Thanks Jessica, that was nice.� 
�Well, I'm a nice girl,� said Jessica to herself as the door shut. 
SURGERY 
Alex heard a squeal, even before he entered the surgery.
  Kate came bounding up to him like a child, although her tumescent belly reminded
  Alex of how far from that she was. More than six months into her pregnancy
  Kate was glowing with health under Dr Schmidt's attentive pre-natal care. 
Kate hugged Alex's chest in genuine delight as his return, and Alex shook
  the doctor's hand whilst he was still entwined. Carol waited patiently for
  Kate's retreat and gave Alex an affectionate peck on the cheek. She looked
  at him fondly. �We've missed you Alex. This place isn't the same without you!� 
�Who's this?� Alex asked of the naked and bemused woman spread out upon a
  hanging frame. She was hung by her wrists and ankles and spread so that her
  sex gaped open like a ripe fruit, ready for eating. 
�A new ponygirl,� Carol excitedly informed him. �We're fitting her pony rings.
  As you can see we've just done her nipples, and now we're going to do her labia.� 
The dangling woman, her mouth wedged open by a thick bit-gag, struggled against
  her heavy leather bonds, but all she could do was sway a little. She was powerless
  to prevent her enforced entry into the sorority of Rabbit Island ponygirls. 
�A frisky one,� Alex observed. �Doesn't look so happy about becoming a ponygirl!� 
The dangling woman agreed with an angry comment her bit-gag couldn't contain.
  (The gag's primary purpose was to give her something to bite on while she was
  being pierced.) 
The doctor grabbed her thigh. �A good strong body and a fighting spirit. She's
  ideal. Nobody wants a meek ponygirl.� 
The woman gave up her struggle, defeated as much by that awful logic, as by
  her bonds. 
Carol and Kate continued the piercings while Alex and the doctor sat down
  and talked. 
�Who's she for?� Alex asked. 
�Frank. She'll be ponygirl Jessica's replacement. A good match in height and
  weight with Debbie.� 
�So you think Jessica's removal will go ahead?� 
�I'm certain,� said the doctor keeping one eye on the piercing operation as
  they conversed. �The Dresden project has performed selective amnesia in several
  patients. The results are excellent, although not perfect. I expect that a
  two year span like Jessica's will involve losing three years of recent memory.� 
The newly recruited ponygirl screamed as Carol pierced her labia. Nurse Kate
  tried to comfort and quieten the girl whose eyes had gone wide with shock at
  the sudden pain on her sex. 
�I'll bet you'll be sorry to lose your nurse,� Alex said. 
The doctor sighed as if in mild pain. �It's good that she is going. To stay
  longer would be difficult.� 
Alex observed (not for the first time) the way Dr Schmidt glanced at Kate,
  and understood what he meant. The doctor was her master and supervisor, the
  one who might occasionally punish her, and the one who chained her up every
  night and released her every morning. And Kate was the one that kept his surgery
  in even better order than he demanded, made his coffee just how he liked it,
  and generally adored him as something between a lover, a master, a boss and
  a father. 
The doctor and Carol fixed the girl's remaining piercings. Each ring had to
  be soldered to create a perfect ring, which when soldered closed could only
  be removed by cutting. 
Kate took Alex to the other side of the surgery and whispered: �Did you know
  that Jessica had a new admirer, although I hate to use that word.� 
�I'd heard.� 
�You have to do something before Master Beattie hurts her... I mean really
  hurts her next time!� 
�I've only just seen her,� said Alex puzzled by Kate's fervour, �she seems
  fine.� 
�She's not! She got a terrible bang on the head a couple of days ago. Didn't
  you see the stitches?� 
Alex shrugged. �She was wearing a wig.� 
�I should be happy but I'm worried sick. Tomorrow Riccardo and I are leaving,
  but I'm terrified of what might happen to Jessica. You're going to look after
  her, aren't you?� 
Alex was just about to explain that he no longer wielded power on the island,
  but upon seeing Kate's watery eyes he responded: �Of course I'll look after
  her.� He kissed her tenderly on the forehead. 
RICCARDO'S LEAVING PARTY 
Alex arrived late at the party having snoozed on his bed for an hour or two
  and then taken a long walk along the beach. The only thing left on the party's
  agenda was drinking, and the revellers had gained a considerable head start
  on him. 
Needless to say, Riccardo's fellow pony drivers Frank and Bruce led the way,
  raiding the Island's limited stocks of strong bottled beer, determined to ensure
  that Riccardo departed the island with hangover from hell. 
Also present in the bar were Kurt and Vince (Alex's self appointed henchman),
  involved in another group of heavy drinkers which included the aforementioned
  Master Beattie. Predictably, the conversation was loud and coarse; and not
  the kind of environment Alex revelled in. Taking a gin and tonic from the bar
  he moved to the tranquil atmosphere of the lobby. 
Erik was untying the girl who had been hog-tied for the last eight hours.
  Her strict bondage was merely one of the lobby's decorative features, a centrepiece
  of a low platform that provided informal seating. 
�Thank you, thank you, thank you,� the red-haired girl said quietly to Erik,
  none the worse from her extended bondage ordeal, but very glad to be out of
  it. Alex didn't recognise the girl; acquired during the previous six months,
  he supposed. 
Another woman was standing nearby, her hands and feet already bound neatly
  in white rope in preparation for her turn on the hog-tie platform. She had
  the dubious honour of the night shift. Alex knew this one as Karen Galtz, the
  journalist who had got more than she bargained for when she landed on the Island. 
While Erik was fixing Karen into position, Alex's attention was taken by the
  living gallery's only other exhibit: Nancy was kneeling in front of Apollo
  (the white statue), her mouth filled by his hard semi-erect member. Her binding
  was simple, bound hand and foot by coarse brown rope. The loop of fishing line
  through her lower lip and attached behind the statue's balls maintained her
  intimate union with the statue. Alex detected Nancy's eyes attempting to follow
  him as he walked around her but the intractable cock in her mouth soon curtailed
  her wondering gaze. 
�She's waiting for Vince,� said Erik. 
�Oh?� 
�He said he'd visit before she was released.� 
Alex laughed, thinking of the time when he and Vince rescued Nancy from the
  jungle tribe following her disastrous escape attempt. In order to hasten their
  progress out of the jungle Vince had cuffed his hand to Nancy's, whilst Alex
  did the same with Lina. Spending two days nights thus attached had apparently
  created an attachment of a different kind, although Alex seemed to remember
  the constant petty arguments between Vince and Nancy. 
Alex observed that Nancy had a wire coming from her sex and a small control
  box taped to her thigh; and Karen, now hogtied on the platform, was similarly
  equipped. Erik turned the small knob on Karen's control, causing the dildo
  to vibrate inside her. She trembled in response, confirming to him that the
  unit was working. 
�Who needs remote control toy cars when we can have remote control women!� Alex
  joked. He sat down next to Karen and took the remote control in his hand. 
�Don't make her come, will you?� Erik advised, �but please go ahead and tease
  her.� 
With a drink by his side, Alex couldn't think of anything he'd rather do than
  tease this hog-tied woman. Karen's lithe body, wriggling like a fish on a hook
  and gave him the sense of playing a musical instrument as he raised and lowered
  the intensity of the vibrations. 
Riccardo's leaving party sounded ever more raucous, but Alex was content to
  sit and play with Karen, who seemed to be responding to his gentle attention. 
Hearing somebody step from the bar into the lobby, Alex turned around to see
  Vince standing there. What surprised him was Vince's relative sobriety, given
  the general atmosphere that he was very much part of. 
He gave a brief acknowledgement to Alex, then addressed Erik: �I think Beattie's
  had too much to drink tonight. What shall we do about the slaves in his room?� 
Erik nodded and walked through the door from which Vince had emerged, in order
  to verify Vince's claim. Such decisions as removing slaves from rooms had to
  be Erik's own. 
Alex expected to enter into some conversation with Vince, but the guy had
  somebody else on his mind - Nancy, kneeling in front of the statue. 
Vince knelt down behind her, entwining his body around hers, his hands grasping
  bare breasts, his lips nuzzling at her neck. It was more than a tease, it seemed
  like an embrace; one that Nancy could not reciprocate, nor could she return
  his kisses, her mouth belonging to the statue. Alex smiled as he looked upon
  the scene of two improbable lovers. 
The tool of their lovemaking was the vibrator with Nancy's sex, which Vince
  set into gentle motion. 
Erik returned from the bar. �Care to give me a hand, Master Alex? Looks like
  Vince is busy.� 
Vince looked up and winked at Alex as he walked by. He always said he was
  a �man of action, not words', and never was it truer than at that moment. 
*** 
There were two slaves in Beattie's room. One - obviously a ponygirl - was
  fixed into the falcon position. 
The other slave was spread-eagled against the wall, so tautly stretched that
  her feet did not touch the floor. Her skin glistened with dark oil that accented
  every muscle and sinew. Her head, with its short dark hair, was girdled by
  an array of straps, which supported a leather blindfold and ball-gag. She twitched
  and moaned, and her head rolled as if trying to relieve herself from the torment.
  There was a cruel beauty to her position, particularly in the enforced split
  of her muscular buttocks that caused Alex's cock to stir. 
Erik started to untie the falcon girl, leaving Alex to handle the spread-eagled
  one. With her wrists and ankles fitted into heavy support cuffs it was simply
  a matter of unclipping them from the securing points so that her feet could
  take her own weight again. Alex couldn't help running his hands up her oiled
  torso as he reached up to release each hand. Released, but immediately reattached
  behind her back. 
By that time Erik had the falcon slave, still encased in a leather hood, standing
  beside him. He dropped the removed rope and leather belts into the rope-maid's
  basket. �I'll take this one back to the ponygirl quarters, you do what you
  want that one. She's not working tomorrow morning.� 
It almost annoyed Alex, realising Erik and Vince had concocted such an elaborate
  ploy. Rather than being Master Beattie's drinking buddy as he thought, Vince's
  objective was simply to get Beattie drunk and incapable, thus leaving Erik
  with no alternative but to remove the bound slaves from his room. Drunken abuse
  of slaves was simply not permitted on Rabbit Island. 
Now, thanks to Vince, and much to his surprise, Alex was escorting Jessica
  to his room. 
�I'll be back in a minute,� said Alex leaving Jessica standing in the middle
  of his bedroom. She appeared to be agitated, unable to stand still, but her
  anxiety was understandable, Alex thought. He went to the bathroom and took
  a pee, flushed the toilet and quickly washed his hands. They were literally
  itching to get hold of his captive. 
Alex liked to see a woman's head in straps, which was at least part of the
  aesthetic appeal of ponygirls. It wasn't just the psychological powerlessness
  he assumed they felt, it was the way the cross-section of straps seemed to
  separate and accentuate each feature of the face. Jessica's full lips stretch
  around the large red ball in her mouth was a particular attraction, as was
  her shapely, slightly retrousse nose, framed by straps in the same way a woman's
  sex is by a garter belt. 
Having had his fill of the sight, Alex decided to remove Jessica's head harness,
  sensing her agitation as if she wanted to say something to him. She immediately
  looked down to see him rubbing his crotch. 
�It's called hot oil. I'm covered in it, and I think there's some on you too.� 
�Jesus!� Alex exclaimed, �I wonder why my cock was itching.� 
He dragged Jessica into the bathroom, turned on the shower and pushed her
  under it. Then, hurriedly removing his clothes he joined her. 
Jessica gasped in ecstatic relief as the hot water eased her itching skin.
  Alex squirted shampoo onto a sponge and cleaned them both. 
After cleaning her front, he made her turn around and pushed her hard against
  the shower wall, vigorously rubbing her arms (still linked by leather cuffs),
  her back and her thighs. Then it was Alex's body that Jessica felt pressed
  against her, and his face buried in the nape of her neck, biting and kissing
  with a ravenous hunger. 
Suddenly Alex pulled Jessica out of the shower and pushed her down so she
  was kneeling against the toilet bowl, her belly spread over the closed lid. 
At such a moment, with both their bodies dripping onto the tiled floor, and
  with only one possible outcome, Jessica wished she had been gagged, fearing
  what she might say. 
It turned out to be �Oh my god,� which she repeated with varying tones as
  Alex fed his cock into her willing sex, and pumped her with a desperate abandon. 
Alex ejaculated with a roar of relief leaving Jessica moments away from her
  own orgasm, her whimpering, which he knew well, told him so. To the victor:
  the spoils of orgasm, to the conquered: exquisite frustration. 
�Please can I cum,� Jessica begged, rocking her belly on the toilet seat as
  if Alex's body was still upon her. She became self-conscious of her nipple
  bells ringing every time she rocked. 
�Go ahead,� said Alex as he dried himself with a large white bath towel. He
  knew she couldn't - not without his assistance or a suitable positioned object. 
�Some things never change,� Jessica sighed, accepting her familiar role as
  the vanquished. She watched Alex dry himself, hoping that her turn would come,
  savouring the fact that in this respect at least, Alex was her servant. 
Being towelled dry by Alex was every bit as pleasurable as she expected, in
  a way even nicer than the shower and the resulting fuck. It was hard not to
  smile. 
Alex suddenly seemed at a loss, disappointed that their coupling had happened
  so suddenly, instead of the elaborate sex and torment games he usually favoured. �What
  to do now?� he muttered to himself as he rubbed the towel through the crack
  of Jessica's buttocks. 
�We could just talk,� Jessica offered with tender hopefulness. 
*** 
Jessica was sat at the foot of Alex's bed looking around the familiar-yet-different
  room. It was the same room Alex occupied as a permanent resident, but had subsequently
  been converted into another visitor's hotel room. Alex had gone for a drink
  and a snack leaving her to await his return. He'd taken the precaution of linking
  her ankle cuffs together, commenting on the usefulness of their built-in snap-locks,
  like the ones on her cuffs. 
As soon as Alex left the room Jessica bunny-hopped to the full-length mirror,
  standing sideways-on and taking in her profile. Like all ponygirls she was
  in exceptional physical shape and felt as healthy as she had ever known. Having
  her arms cuffed behind her caused her shapely breasts to thrust forward as
  if at attention. She had to admit that the nipple rings and their infuriating
  bells did add a nice erotic embellishment to her body. She then hopped back
  to the bed - her nipple bells jingling - and waited quietly for Alex's return.
  It did occur to Jessica that if she rolled onto her belly and bent her ankles
  back - like a hog-tie position - her fingers might just be able to reach the
  clip connecting her ankles together, yet she didn't attempt it. What was the
  point, she reasoned with herself. 
Alex returned twenty minutes later carrying a tray, which he set down on a
  small round table to one side of the bed. 
�You're not properly dressed,� he said. Just as Jessica's brow furrowed at
  his comment he held up an item she hadn't seen in six months: A red ribbon. 
She opened her knees and stayed still and quiet as Alex laced her labia rings
  is a criss-cross design, tying a bow at the bottom so that the ribbon ticked
  her thighs. �That's better,� Alex commented as if that one act had transformed
  Jessica from naked to properly attired. 
�It tickles,� said Jessica, �but I like it. You're the only one who laces
  me like this.� 
�It's not so strange is it? Women wear earrings and bracelets and necklaces
  to make them look attractive. Seeing a woman's sex laced like that looks more
  beautiful than any jewelry I can image. 
�I'm not sure the high-class ladies of New York would feel the same way.� 
Alex chuckled. �I have a friend who's wife dresses like that ever day, and
  she works on Wall Street. Of course nobody at work knows about it. Just her
  and her husband.� 
Jessica looked down at herself, biting her lip in thought. �That would be
  kind of cool, wearing this under normal clothes... for the right man of course.� 
�Get in the chair. Let's eat,� said Alex decisively, gesturing to the soft
  visitor's chair on the other side of the round table. Jessica hopped a couple
  of times and fell back into the chair. A tall glass of sparkling mineral water
  with a straw was obviously hers. There was also a plate of canap&eacute;s Alex
  had raided from the bar's buffet spread, most definitely placed in the centre
  of the table as if it was to be shared. Having earlier washed and dried her,
  Alex was now hand-feeding her. Jessica promised herself that she would be the
  perfect guest; no moods or sarcastic comments! It wouldn't be easy. 
Alex took a sip of his red wine. �So what did you want to talk about? Anything
  you want!� 
�You've been in New York?� 
�For part of the time.� 
�How are the Mets doing?� 
�It's still pre-season.� 
�Do you have a wife or girlfriend?� 
�Divorced a long time ago. No girlfriend, but I'm not without company in New
  York. I have many connections to suit my taste.� 
�You mean women who like...� 
�What I like!� Alex finished off, saving Jessica's blushes. 
Jessica felt more uncomfortable talking about life in New York than Alex did,
  so she changed the subject: �How is Riccardo?� 
�Drunk! He's just gone to bed.� 
�I'm glad Riccardo and Kate are happy, but I'm sad they are leaving.� 
�Your time will come soon enough. It's only another three months. You'll be
  back in New York for the baseball season,� Alex said cheerily. 
�But they're going to wipe my mind. I won't remember Kate, or Debbie, or anyone
  else! It'll be like this place never existed.� 
�That's good isn't it? You'll have your life back - your family and friends
  and career. Isn't that more important?� Alex pushed a smoked salmon and cream
  cheese canap&eacute; into Jessica's mouth. 
Jessica savoured the morsel for a few moments, and then said: �Don't you think
  Kate's a lucky girl? Riccardo owns her, but he adores her, and she's carrying
  his child. A few nights ago, after this incident with my head, I had to spend
  the night in the surgery under observation because of my concussion. Doctor
  Schmidt was funny! I was shackled to the top and bottom of the bed, and he
  said that Kate had to keep a close watch on me, so he shackled her alongside
  me. The two of us were stretched out on a single bed like sardines. 
Alex cracked an indulgent smile, keen for Jessica to continue her titillating
  story. 
�The way we were fixed, all we could do was kiss and rub our bodies together...
  and talk of course. We talked for hours and in effect we said our goodbyes,
  making sure we left nothing unsaid. Eventually Kate fell asleep, and I rubbed
  against that wonderful kicking belly of hers,� Jessica paused, her eyes welling
  up, �hoping that some of her luck would rub off on me.� 
Alex stretch out a hand, offering a paper napkin to Jessica's face, and wiping
  away a stray tear. 
�And now I have a so-called admirer in Master Beattie. The other night I thought
  he was going to kill me when he banged my head against the floor. With him
  it's not about punishment and training, it's about hurting me. You saw how
  he had me stretched against the wall. He was going to lash my back when he
  returned this evening.� 
Alex looked sympathetic. �He's a cruel man, I know.� 
�Not half as cruel as you Sir,� said Jessica, immediately occupying herself
  with a sip of water, leaving Alex to mull over her words. For the first time
  ever she had left him dumbstruck. 
She broke the awkward silence with a sad smile. �And not half as handsome
  either.� 
That last line turned out to be a conversation killer, and Jessica couldn't
  believe that she'd said it (even though the latter part was certainly true.) 
Eventually Alex stood up and kissed her forehead. �I'm tired. Lay on the bed
  Jessica.� 
Having recounted her tale of two sardines in a bed Jessica wasn't surprised
  to find herself similarly fixed on one side of Alex's much larger bed. She
  felt a guilty thrill as Alex grabbed her ankles, pulled them towards the foot
  of the bed, threaded a rope through the D rings on her ankle cuffs, and then
  tugged on the rope to remove any kinks from her body. Jessica always found
  having her ankles tied or secured to be many times more erotic than her wrists. 
Alex ran his hands slowly up the length of Jessica's body, savouring her curves
  as one can do only when a woman is tied tightly and unable to interrupt the
  progress of his hands. He covered her with the quilt and went to the bathroom,
  leaving Jessica to explore the tightness of her bonds and the unreachable tickle
  of the ribbon against her inner thighs. Alex liked to call it the �good girl� position,
  leaving Jessica to wander whether it was a reward for being a good girl, or
  because stretched out on the bed in that strict fashion she had no option but
  to be one. The latter, she knew from experience, was certainly true. 
The room went dark upon the flick of a switch and Alex climbed into the other
  side of the bed. Soon he was asleep, proving he was as tired as he said. So
  tired that he hadn't even touched her. Jessica battled against her bondage,
  not with any expectation of escape but simply in the hope that her body - her
  buttocks, could touch him. It seemed to sum up their peculiar relationship:
  He was so close but still out of her reach. 
*** 
Jessica roused from her slumber realising that Alex had just tied her hands
  behind her back. What she thought was a just vivid morning dream had in fact
  just happened. It was a fait accompli - little point in her making resistance
  as Alex removed her ankle cuffs and neatly roped her crossed ankles together.
  She pretended to be asleep, thus able to feel the thoroughness in Alex's ropework.
  He drew a rope between her bound wrists and ankles a slowly pulled them together.
  Jessica's back began to arch until her fingers were touching her feet. 
Alex pulled her bound body across the bed until it was positioned where he
  his hips and thighs had lain. Jessica couldn't carry the lie any longer, but
  she did a good job of acting shocked at her predicament, tugging indignantly
  at the ropes that bundled her up in just the manner that Master Alex preferred. 
He said good morning in a condescending manner, as if castigating her for
  sleeping in, and then said: �Open up!� The ring-gag was dangling invitingly
  from his fingers in front of her nose. 
Jessica frowned and made a croaking protest. �I'm tired, Sir.� 
�Open!� Alex repeated at double the volume of the previous command, leaving
  Jessica in no doubt that this was the last time he would say it. She opened,
  and Alex fitted the leather-covered ring behind her teeth and buckled the straps
  behind her head. 
Concerns for her comfort always came second to her erotic beauty (as Alex
  saw it), Jessica felt fortunate indeed if they ever coincidenced, such as with
  her ribbon-laced labia rings. With gags, except for ponygirl bit-gags, it never
  did. She hated the way they stretched her jaw, the difficulty of breathing
  and the humiliation of drooling down her chin. Her evident discomfort and embarrassment
  seemed to add to Alex's perverse opinion of beauty. 
Alex resumed his position on the bed propped up to a seated angle with the
  addition of Jessica's redundant pillow. Jessica was between his legs, his flaccid
  penis just inches from her nose. Jessica knew this game all too well, and watched,
  almost mesmerised, as Alex wrapped a leather cord around the base of his ball,
  knotting beneath them. That act of constriction brought his cock semi erect
  and brushing against Jessica's wide-open lips. A moment later she tasted it,
  as it lay heavy on her tongue. Alex looped the leather cord to either side
  of the ring gag and pulled out the slack, forcing more penis into Jessica's
  mouth. 
While Jessica lay hog-tied and gagged with his penis, Alex casually read some
  journals, indicating to her that she was merely an appendage, a toy for his
  pleasure, a soft wet mouth with a helpless body attached. He'd done this to
  her a dozen times in the past two years and Jessica still didn't how she felt
  about it. 
She liked the touch of his legs around her sides, there was a certain comfort
  and protection in that. She liked it when he occasionally petted her head,
  and when he read the baseball results out loud. As a reluctant but experienced
  connoisseur of how ropes had been applied to her limbs, she sometimes liked
  the feel of the bondage, with a grudging admiration for the rope-tiers ability. 
She hated wishing that Alex would do this to her every day! 
The door knocked, and opened when Alex pressed a buzzer by his bed. At such
  a time Jessica was grateful the bed covers had her completely concealed but
  for the peculiar landscape of covers her contorted body created above. 
Kate smiled at Alex and silently dropped her nurse's apron to the floor. She
  delved into a drawer and retrieved a large vibrator, holding it up for Alex's
  approval, promptly given. Stealthily, she took up a place between Alex's ankles,
  pulling up the covers as she went, exposing Jessica's bound wrists and ankles. 
�Nice rope-work, Sir,� Kate commented, revealing her identity to Jessica. �She
  loves to be tied like that, but she complained that she'd never had an orgasm
  in this position,� added Kate mischieviously. 
Alex tutted. �What a slut!� 
Jessica's garbled protest met only with laughter, even more so as she attempted
  a futile defence with her bound hands as Kate teased her buttocks with the
  vibrator. Then the vibrator moved gently to her sex, transmitting its vibrations
  through the labia rings. Still laced together they afforded Jessica protection
  from penetration but not from surface stimulation. 
Kate took her time with Jessica's arousal, making sure she didn't come to
  the boil too soon. This was a moment to be savoured rather than rushed, and
  Kate even hummed a gentle song as she continued her caress. A wet patch began
  to form on the bed sheet beneath Jessica's sex. When Jessica started whimpering
  rhythmically, Kate joked with Alex about Jessica wanting to sing a tune of
  her own. That was when she saw that Alex's eyes were closed, and she recognised
  the look, like the grimace of mild pain. 
That's when Kate knew she would get two birds with one proverbial stone. Jessica
  was squirming with a wild abandon that strong bondage seemed to encourage rather
  than prevent, and the effect on Alex was all too clear. What Alex and Jessica's
  orgasmic duet lacked in harmony it made up with ecstasy. 
Kate brought a small towel from the bathroom and put it under Jessica's belly.
  Then she slipped into bed alongside Alex, snuggling up to his side, obliging
  Alex to put his arm around her rather than have it trapped at his side. 
Nobody spoke. Kate couldn't bear to look under the covers at her friend. Their
  private goodbye the previous morning was enough, and was how she wanted it
  to be. Alex felt Kate's belly against him, and recalled Jessica's comments
  about hoping some of Kate's luck would rub off on her. 
Alex had been musing on Jessica's words during the night, having invaded his
  dreams: Luck! Sometimes people confuse luck with karma, and yet those words
  are opposites. The defining quality of luck is that it is undeserved, whereas
  karma is deserved, or earned. And what of fate or destiny? Alex hated both
  those words, sensing in them a morbid finality. Is our destiny deserved or
  undeserved? Changeable by our force of will, or immutable? In the hands of
  some god, or prey to the will of fellow man? While Jessica yearned to be as
  lucky as Kate, Alex knew that luck would have little to do with her future. 
He had often been accused of playing god, and usually just smiled in response.
