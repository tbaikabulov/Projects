What a Day!


What a day this was finally going to be. I could just relax, unwind and most of all have peace and quite with no one around to distract me from doing absolutely nothing but some small yard work, swim in the pool or just do whatever it is that I wanted. 

The weather was beyond perfect on this June day at a warm but pleasant 26C with a mild wind and no one home. You see after a very long week at work and with my wife&#8217;s 24 year old younger sister moving in with us for the summer, time was at a premium.

My wife Janice had left for work and Shannon was waiting to go out with her friends and would not be back until the following evening, which meant no one would call, or any one would be dropping by unexpectedly.&nbsp; 

It is not that I minded having Shannon living with us, it was just our usual bondage fun was now not as plentiful as it was before her arrival. We did the usual things like having me cuffed at night in our room where we would not be bothered, but it was apparent that we were living in a Lull.

We also had those days when I would be forced to sleep Handcuffed and wearing short leg irons but I still woke up handcuffed from the night before and would have to drink my coffee on the back deck in my robe on with Janice doing the look-out thing for any possible signs of Shannon. For the most part we worked around the minor disruption of having a guest for 2 months. That is what family is for, or so I thought.

I started my day off slowly, by cutting the lawn and cleaning up around the swimming pool, you know just putting things in their proper place. I then decided that I was going to have a nice relaxing Jacuzzi tub and make sure my Chastity belt was properly cleaned and I could take advantage of no one being home and listen to the music as loud as I wanted.

I have been wearing a Carrera High Security Chastity belt now for about 5 years, ever since Janice tricked me into trying it on when she claimed to be going out with friends while leaving the keys in it so I would think that I could get it off. Well I couldn&#8217;t get it off then and the only time it comes off now is when I am thoroughly handcuffed in Hinged and High Security Smith and Wesson Handcuffs.

I have to say that I have become accustomed to any limitations it has, but can&#8217;t seem to remember any along the way, except for the obvious that I cannot touch myself, Damn, to think that there is no way for me to free myself of this belt. Oh well, that is just my life now and it is not a bad life at all.

I ran the bath and enjoyed the leisurely pace as to which I was enjoying it, allowing my mind to think across many planes of thoughts and ideas about what my day was going to be and how many possibilities it could hold.

I have to admit I found myself thinking back over several experiences with Janice while we had the opportunity to just be playful and frisky and I couldn&#8217;t help but smile on my own as to the luck that I have had with her. 

The perfect mate, gorgeous, attractive and absolutely stunning with an incredible body that I found allot of men and quite a few women looking at. I was really enjoying my moment of calm reflection when it occurred to me �Why wouldn&#8217;t I want to have a day like that today?� I can do anything I want and wait for Janice to come home from work.

It was like being hit by a thought that I had never had before, LOL and before I knew it I was conjuring up all sorts of things I could do so that when she returned home from work she could find me in some form of restraint or another, unable to get free or a way to get away from her. Janice always liked this and it always made her smile knowing that when I put the handcuffs on I am stuck and have to wait for her to release me because she always has the keys with her everywhere she goes.

I couldn&#8217;t help but feel myself starting to get hard within the confines of the Stainless Steel Chastity Belt and this only added more fuel to what was becoming a very arousing thought for the day I would be having.

So without wasting anymore time and finding something which actually motivated me on this restful day I got out of the tub and dried myself off. I then proceeded to our bedroom and opened our play drawer and observed the many items from which to choose the handcuffs and steel restraints for the position I could put myself into for Janice.

We have a specific interest that we both share and that is STEEL, the kind which cannot be removed without an actual Key, usually a special or specific type of key which will not allow the handcuffs to be picked or shimmed open. Steel that included Handcuffs, of many, many different types to choose from; American, British, Italian, old, new, Standard, or our favorite High Security. We have spent allot of time and money buying for ourselves the toys which we both so respect and enjoy. 

So today was going to be nothing but absolute High Security and chains with minimal movement. I started putting together the items which I thought I was going to use and after I had finished placing them on our bed I looked and thought, �there was no way I was going to get all that stuff on� and smiled to myself that I was going to be having so much fun just trying.

It was at that moment that I saw the Key Ring lying on the bed about 3 feet away from where I had just placed everything. I new this was to be the Handcuff Keys because I was never allowed to touch the ring and was only allowed to look at them, which was not unusual because I usually had them held up to my face several times in the past and Wow what a score I had just made.

I picked up the keys, I got the keys, yahoo, this now meant that there could be changes in the positions that I wanted to place myself into. I really didn&#8217;t think that it would really matter if I had the keys or not, it is not like I would be able to touch myself or anything like that anyways with the Chastity Belt on. I never could figure out why Janice was always adamant about where the Keys were at any given time of day, today she had left them out lying around and now I got them so to bad for her I thought.

I was smart enough to know from past experiences that I should check the keys to make sure they worked and I then proceeded to test all the handcuffs to make sure they were in proper functioning condition.&nbsp; I was pleased that they all worked the way they were supposed to and continued with getting my day together. Past experience has taught me that Janice can sometimes like to play games with me and it is better to check than to assume anything.

I decided to write her a letter on the computer and share with her my thoughts about the day ahead. So I sat down and wrote the following note

Hi Janice! I started my day off doing the usual house work that needs to be done and decided to have a Jacuzzi bath when it dawned on me that it has been quite along time since we have had the opportunity for me to be Handcuffed and locked under your control.

I hope you don&#8217;t mind, because I have decided to put on a couple sets of handcuffs and leg irons and just lounge around and wait for you to come home.

I did unfortunately find the Handcuff keys which were lying on the bed and I am sorry that you have forgotten them this morning when you went to work, so to make sure that I stay handcuffed I placed them on the bottom of the swimming pool. 

I doubt that I can get them again and maybe when you come home you can put me into the cell for the night? To teach me not to take the cuffs off without your permission which I have to admit I did SEVERAL TIMES.:)JJ:

I hope you enjoyed your day and I look forward to you coming home

Love Micheal

Now that I had that done I could get going on more interesting and fun things to do to myself. It was now 1:30 and Janice would not be home until around 5:00 so that would give me lots of time. 

I placed the printed letter on her pillow in our room and proceeded to put the Ankle Cuffs onto my legs. The first pair was to long so I decided to use a shorter pair and so I took the first pair off. I then put on the second pair and walked around a little and realized that they fit just perfectly for the rest of my position I had in mind. I placed a set of High security handcuffs on behind my back and checked to make sure I couldn&#8217;t get out without the keys and did that gratuitous struggle thing for amusement.

I have to admit that for the next 45 minutes to an hour I changed from one position to another trying all sorts of different things to see how far I could go without getting actually stuck. It was during one of these times that I was so engulfed in the moment that I never heard the phone ring and I have to tell you now that it never even registered in my mind. I will get back to that a little later.

I had played around enough and figured that I would take a break, make myself something to eat and then put myself into the Handcuffs which I could not get out off. So that is exactly what I did, I made a sandwich sat out on the back deck in the sun and had a cool soft drink after my meal.

I then went and retrieved the handcuff keys on the ring and walked over to the edge of the pool and threw them into the middle of the deep end of the pool and turned and walked back into the house.

I was now ready to complete my position and wait for my loving wife to return home from work, wondering how much crap I was going to be in for having played with her handcuff keys. At any rate I wasn&#8217;t too worried for I found her bark as of late was not as nearly as bad as her bite when we had first started together. She used to rule with an IRON FIST and it has now softened to what could be considered a hard but flexible position of Control.

I started by putting on the Stainless Steel Collar and locked it into place and checked it to make sure I could not get it off. I then took the shorter ankle cuffs and locked one onto my ankle and then threaded the round ring of the hobble chain through it before locking the second ankle cuff onto my other ankle.

Once I had this done I took the slightly longer pair and wove them around the chain of the first and locked them onto my ankles making me have two pairs of ankle cuffs on my ankles. I then double locked them with a pen to make sure they could not get any tighter.

I then took the other end of the hobble chain and brought it up to the back of my Chastity belt and placed a pair of Smith and Wesson model 104 High Security Handcuffs through the loop. I then locked the loop to the back of the Chastity Belt onto the D Ring which was permanently fixed and could not be removed. This essentially gave me a very short stride when walking and would not allow me to straighten my legs without a certain amount of effort which was not to be taken for granted.

Having completed this I took two small locks and placed one of them onto each ring in my nipples which would allow me to wear them and not remove them if I wanted them off later.

I then picked up a pair of Hiatt triple hinged handcuffs and made sure that the key holes were facing upwards. With my other hand I attached a leash to the front of the collar and was now ready to place my hands into the handcuffs waiting for me.

I put my right wrist behind my back and found the dangling Smith and Wesson cuff and ratcheted it slowly listening to the number of clicks it made. 17 clicks, perfect, now to my other wrist which I placed behind my back into the other awaiting high security cuff and counted 17 more clicks.

My hands were now handcuffed behind my back and I pulled and twisted to make sure that I could not get them loose or more importantly off. As if I could, I don&#8217;t know how many times I have tried in the past but have been unable to break free from this position, but it never stops me from trying to think that I can.

Now for the Hinged handcuffs. It never fails to amaze me how my mind works, it goes like this, and even with High Security Handcuffs locked to the back of a High Security Chastity Belt I still believe that I have some form of freedom. I never seem to loose that ideology until I am placed into Hinged Handcuffs and then all of a sudden everything comes into play and the walls come crashing down so to speak.

So here I go, making sure the key holes are still facing upwards I place my first and then second wrist into the hinged cuffs and close them until I know they are tight enough so that I have restricted movement in my hands. I find the pen and after what feels like hours I have successfully double locked all the handcuffs on my wrists.

Now What? I had been so engrossed in getting this far I didn&#8217;t actually think past this point. I know knew I was completely stuck and with the hinged cuff key holes facing upwards even with the keys I couldn&#8217;t get them off anyways. I decided to take myself for an exploratory walk around the house.

I did the usual trek, through the living room, down the halls, into the basement family room and back up into what is always the last place I venture, the kitchen. The walking was obviously tough and slow going, but fun to do none the less.

I have to admit that the feeling of complete vulnerability is such a wonderful feeling. I decided to go out on the back deck and just layback on the lounger for a while and wait for the return of Janice to let me go if she wanted to be nice.

I positioned the lounge chair on the deck which took a certain amount of effort and I finally got it into the best position for optimal sunbathing and laid down with my hands clearly stuck behind my back locked to the belt. This maneuver is tricky but manageable and after a few minutes of shifting and adjusting I was perfectly comfortable and content.

I must have enjoyed myself a little to much because I found myself getting somewhat tired and after having glanced at the clock on&nbsp; table it was still only 2:45 and that meant that I had approx 2 hours and 15 minutes to go. OK, I will just dose off for a half hour and then I will get off this lounger and go sit in the shallow end of the pool and relax, no problem, there&#8217;s the plan, I thought to myself and closed my eyes and started to dose off.

Wow, what a dream I must have been having. I was awaking into consciousness tugging on the handcuffs attached to the back of my belt feeling fully hard inside of the chastity belt without any success of freedom thinking that I was swimming in the pool.

As I became more aware of my environment and the fog was lifting out of my brain before I opened my eyes I could hear splashing in the pool. I immediately opened my eyes and took in my surroundings. I was still on the lounger in the exact same position I was in before I fell asleep. I looked at the clock and it said 3:27 that meant I fell asleep for about 45 minutes. Janice could not possibly be home from work yet, so who the hell is in the pool? Thinking that somebody was in my pool without permission I went to sit up and everything hit me again. Damn! OH OH! I could still hear water splashing in the pool, it was only fifteen feet away.

I tried pulling my arms from behind my back and realized the position that I placed myself into and was not going to let me get out of it so easily, or quickly by my own accord. I stopped to let everything get back into focus and just relax for a second and explore all my options before doing anything stupid. It is amazing how fast the brain can process information during a crisis, and this was definitely a crisis.

OK, get to the bedroom and figure everything out later I thought to myself and gave myself that great motivational statement which obviously wasn&#8217;t needed, OK move! 

Right!!!! That is allot easier said than done. I found it very difficult to sit up and get my legs positioned for me to stand up on them. Considering I just woke up from a deep sleep I was not so coordinated and with my hands so securely handcuffed behind my back I had no way to leverage myself up from the lounger. This just added insult to what was a difficult position to be in to begin with. I did get to my feet and started to head towards the door of the kitchen when I realized that it was now closed.

How the hell did the door get closed? I left it open, who cares, get to the door, open it and get inside before anyone sees you, is all I could get away with in my mind. I went to the door and turned around with my hands cuffed behind my back and tried to grab the door handle. I could not get my hands to respond the way they were supposed to, I had to get up on my toes and try to find the middle of the door and then grip the handle.

 
Being in hinged cuffs which limits that normal motor movement of the hands greatly restricts motion and movement, but having my hands attached to the back of the Chastity belt only made this maneuver that much more difficult. I grabbed the handle and tried to turn it, but found that I could not do a full rotation of the handle because of the hinged cuffs and the Chastity Belt. I had to shift my whole body and after several attempts I still did not have the door opened. I then started to have a panicked moment. Not quite an attack, but still an accelerated process of dread and immediate concern all rolled into one.

I then heard laughter and a �What&#8217;s the matter� Michael? �Can&#8217;t get into the house�? I then turned my head in the direction of the voice and saw Shannon standing there in her bathing suit. 

I was completely mortified and attempted to turn and look the other way. Don&#8217;t get me wrong Shannon is stunning in a bathing suit with her shoulder length blonde hair, petite frame of 110 pounds and those 34D breasts were enough for any man to look at, but most would not prefer to look at a women like her in the position which I was currently in, well maybe some, but not me. Janice&#8217;s body and hers were identical but it was not the same thing.

Being in my current position was not going to give me much opportunity to cover up let alone get away. I was completely cornered. The top deck where I was sitting has no exit and the only way off the deck was down the stair where Shannon was standing or into the kitchen which that door I could not open. I attempted to react like I didn&#8217;t see her and she would just go away and I could get back to lounging and sleeping or something that would not be as humiliating as this.

It was about 5 seconds and four steps for her later when I realized that I could not move forward anymore and was being turned around in the most uncomfortable aggressive manner. Shannon had made it up the few stairs and had grabbed the leash on the collar and was pulling me towards her. As if I had any other choice but to turn around and face the direction she was pulling from.

I then thought that if I didn&#8217;t look up at her it would not be as damn bad as I was feeling at that precise moment in time. As if she could read my mind she tugged on the leash and stated �Get on your fucking knees right now� In total defiance I looked her straight in the eyes thinking that I had some male dominance over her and I would not listen or comply with any direction she tried to give me, this is where things went really bad, for me at least.

As I looked into her eyes I could clearly see a familiarity and strength that I had come to know all to well and that was of her sister&#8217;s or my wife Janice&#8217;s determination and will. 

NO! I thought, There can&#8217;t be two of them in this world was all I could process before I felt the forward pulling of the leash and watched her place her right foot over the middle of the chain to my collar while holding the end in her left hand. Shannon stepped downwards onto the chain making me fall to my knees in a very dramatic fashion. I was now firmly kneeling on the ground and with my neck being held under her foot by the leash to the collar I could not lift my head at all and was forced onto the beck below me where I once was just standing.


Shannon must have been smiling again&nbsp; because I could hear a softer sounding voice when she stated �Isn&#8217;t it a good feeling for you to do&nbsp; what your told, it will save you later�&nbsp; Staring down in disbelief, not understanding how I ended up in this position, on my knees before Shannon, Janice&#8217;s sister without any way to escape with my hands so securely attached to the back of the Chastity Belt, with completely no movement coming from my form in front of Shannon.

It seemed like an eternity before either of us spoke but she started and all I could do was listen in shock to what she was stating and it went something like this;

Michael, you and I are going to have a little heart to heart right now and if you had answered the phone when your sister had called earlier I would not be here right now. I would be away with my friends for the night. Since you failed to answer that important call from Janice who was going to tell you to bring over those handcuff keys that she left on the bed, she called me and asked me if I could swing back and grab them and just take them with me for the night and return them to her when I got back tomorrow.

Yes Michael, I know all about the toys and handcuffs and all the things you two do together, or should I say that Janice does to you. I was informed that I was going to be asked some questions and it would be in my best interest to be honest and the leash attached to the collar was removed from under Shannon&#8217;s foot so I could sit up on my knees.

Shannon informed me that she was asked about her thoughts on bondage and handcuffs before she decided to move in for the summer. I new way in advance of what you and Janice did with each other and you would be surprised how many ideas that Janice got&nbsp; originally from me, so don&#8217;t play the victim here, just know your role and everything will be fine, well maybe not for you and she let out a robust laugh.

I was also informed that when Shannon came home her original plan was to just go into the bedroom take the keys and proceed with her plans with her friends. It wasn&#8217;t until she stumbled onto the letter on the bed and read it that she changed her plans, well delayed them actually. 

Shannon informed me that she thought about confronting me on taking someone else&#8217;s property without permission but when she came outside and saw the position I was in she new what to do, because it was apparent that I had fallen asleep on the lounger. Shannon had went and asked that her friends go grab something to eat and she would be calling them shortly to come back and pick her up when she was finished with a couple of errands she had to take of in the house before they all went away.

I was now twisting and pulling quite hard on the handcuffs trying everything to get out of them and was clearly thinking �whatever then, take the keys and leave� I can explain this to Janice and not look so bad in front of Shannon.

Shannon was clearly studying my every move and motion and walked around behind me and grabbed the handcuffs and pulled on then. They of course didn&#8217;t move more than an inch and she said �Good Job, I can clearly see that you won&#8217;t be getting out of those tonight� and let my hands fall back to wear they would naturally sit in this position.

She then pulled on the leash and asked me �How does it feel�? Knowing you played with my sister&#8217;s stuff without her permission and thought that you could get away with it? �Well, ANSWER ME� she stated in an aggressive tone.

I looked up at her and stated sarcastically �I almost got away with it and smiled� Shannon leaned into me and continued to smile and without removing the smile she slapped me across the face and said � don&#8217;t you be so fucking indignant with me, you have no idea who you are fucking with� and then continued to keep smiling.

Holy Shit! Ouch, did that ever hurt.

Shannon then stated that �I better not say anything else until she is finished getting me ready for the rest of my fun and exciting day� I was then asked if I was going to be rude anymore and was told to just nod yes or no. I nodded no and then she continued.

Shannon then asked me where this so called cell was located, she had been in the house with us for 3 weeks and had been everywhere and did not see anything like a cell.

I told her it was out of sight and it was not known to anyone except Janice and I. We had it built during the course of construction of the house. I was then told to take her to where the cell was located and Shannon pulled up on the leash and asked me which part of the house we were going to be going. I replied by stating downstairs into the study and Shannon pulled the leash keeping my head up high and forcing me to walk in an unnatural way.

I was led to the kitchen door and Shannon took out her keys and unlocked the door, no wonder I couldn&#8217;t open it, she had locked it.

We proceeded through the house and then down the stairs which were quite hard to walk down with me being pulled by the leash attached to the Stainless steel collar that kept me a complete prisoner now. It was very humiliating being so well restrained and handcuffed at my own expense, that I just wanted to struggle and slow down before we got to where the cell was secretly located.

Shannon continued with a firm grip on the leash and every time I slowed down she pulled just a little harder directing me without any effort on her part in what was a defenseless position that I was now in.

We made it without any incidents down the stairs across the Family room, and then wreck room into the study. Shannon stopped in the middle of the Study and looked at me and said �OK, where is this secret room� I then told her to go over to the right hand side of the book shelf and she will find a clasp and just turn it.

Shannon did exactly what I directed her to do and she then asked �OK, now what�? I then instructed her to stand in front of that section of the book shelf and give a light push.&nbsp; As Shannon moved the Book shelf it slid back without any effort about 3 � feet making a very clearly defined entrance way and then the light automatically came on.

Shannon stood in the door way and was amazed at the size of the room, it was 12X14 and&nbsp; brightly lit, on the walls were all sorts of restraints and handcuffs. The room had all sorts of bondage devises and that Aedec restraint chair which started all of this so long ago.

In the corner of the room was the cell, it was recessed and built into the back wall and had three concrete walls and the front was made out 1 � inch stainless steel bars spaced at 4 inch intervals. The cell was 6x9 making it not so large, but more than completely functional. In the cell was a toilet and a bed on the floor and nothing else.

I had spent several nights and even one time a full week in there without being let out, so I knew the cell was more than adequate for whoever was placed into it. Shannon looked at me and said �I never knew you were so spoiled to have a playroom so nice� I will have to compliment Janice when I see her.

Shannon then turned to me and stated �go on, get in the cell� It was apparent that I had some trepidation about this next request for Shannon smiled and looked me in the eyes and stated �NOW�

I new better than to say no to her and started to walk as best I could into the cell. When I entered the cell she asked me where the key to the door was and I informed her that the lock was specially designed for us and had a couple of unique features that were completely different from other Cell locks.

Shannon then asked me what these features were and I then proceed to tell her that not only was there a High Security key on the wall which she proceeded to go retrieve, but that on the inside of the front latch plate which closes facing the Stainless Steel frame was a six digit tumbler system that could be changed only when the door was open with the key in it. Every time the key was used the tumblers would reset at 000000 When the tumblers were changed and set with the key in the lock, it would ensure that only the person who set the lock or new the combination to the tumblers would be able to open it. 

I then went on explaining that on the front plate was another identical 6 tumbler mechanism which would have to be set before the key could go back into the lock mechanism to turn the key to open the cell door.

Shannon then asked me if the key would work without setting any numbers and I informed her that it wouldn&#8217;t. She then asked me, if someone else had a key and tried to put it into the lock that had the numbers set would the key work, and I informed her that it was impossible and if she set the numbers and closed the door and turned the key that only she would be able to let me out of the cell.

Shannon smiled from ear to ear and said � This is getting better by the minute� she then asked for a final time � If I set the numbers and turn the Key, even Janice can&#8217;t let you out, is that what you telling me�?

I stated to Shannon that it is with deep regret, but that is exactly true and the Locking mechanism is completely secure and unpick able. I would be completely as I am now when she returned without anyway out of this cell but by her letting me out or giving the 6 digit tumbler number sequence to her sister. 6 Digits mean&#8217;s 100,000 potential combination and they would have to be tried one by one, and that would take days to figure out or if not weeks.

Shannon then said she needed a minute to think about this great turn of events. I was not sure what she meant but she was smiling and I had come to know rather quickly that was not a good sign.

Shannon then walked up to a wall that held some of our locks and handcuffs and turned and started to walk towards me with her hand behind her back. Not knowing what she was holding Shannon told me to back up farther into the cell. I was directed to stand at the back of the cell and I did what I was told.

Shannon then stood in front of the cell and put her arm through the cell and tried to see if she could reach me. This was impossible for her to do and again she just smiled. I observed her go back to another wall and take some chain off the wall and then she proceeded back to stand in front of the cell and directed me to take a step forward.

I took a step forward with my handcuffed ankles still together and she again tried to reach into the cell without any success of touching me. I was then told to kneel and get down on my knees. I did as I was told and she again put her arm through without success.

I was instructed to cross my legs and then sit down on them and don&#8217;t move. I couldn&#8217;t figure out what she was doing, but I new I was about to find out. Shannon opened the cell door and entered the cell; she stopped about 3 feet away from me and asked me if I understood that I was not to move. I nodded yes and she proceeded to walk behind me as best she could. I felt her standing behind me and the rattle of a chain in the eyelet on the wall and then I heard a click, it was a padlock closing and then a second later I felt her turning the collar and then I heard another click.

Shannon then stepped away from me and told me to stand up. I stood up as best I could and realized that I was now about 3 feet away from the back wall, but could not move any farther forward. Shannon then asked me to sit down on the toilet which was about 3 feet away against the other side wall and I could just barely make it by turning the collar in front and shoving my ass backwards I could just touch it with half my ass. Shannon informed me that was all that was required of me if I needed to go to the can.

I couldn&#8217;t believe this predicament that I was now in, with her attaching the chain to the collar from the wall of the cell there was no way I could even get close to the door even if it was left open, it was quite apparent that I was extremely stuck and would be this way until Shannon returned and let me out.

That was a very bad last thought that I just had, because as it turned out, I was about to get the next installment of Shannon&#8217;s wrath. Shannon asked me to pick a number between 1 and 10, I informed her that she was not funny, and she only replied that will cost you another. Not knowing what she meant, I left that alone and continued to look at her, she then said that since she had tried to be nice and I couldn&#8217;t play nicely with others in the sand box that she would have to take corrective action and teach me something about team play.

 She then smiled at me, turned and walked over to a wall with several gags on it and took way to long looking and touching them all. Shannon then turned and started walking back towards the still open cell and straight at me.

Shannon entered the cell and held up a very nasty looking and completely functional Dildo Gag. The inside diameter of this gag was custom made for me and had an enlarged internal plate which forced my tongue down so I could not gag or choke while filling the rest of my mouth with a pliable rubber compound. When placed into my mouth it would completely fill my mouth and ensure that I could not utter a single sound. 

The penis portion of the gag was a full 9 inches long and 4 � thick. This gag also had a full set of leather head straps which would keep it completely in place and worse than that everyone of the 5 buckles fully locked with&nbsp; padlocks, making this our most secure and enjoyable Gag&#8217;s. I really hated this gag when we first got it, but over time I became conditioned to wear it for longer and longer periods of time and now I new that my earlier rude actions and comments were going to be fully addressed by Shannon.

I was told to open my mouth which I did and the entire head gear was attached to my face and head with precision and experience from Shannon, it was apparent that she was familiar with this device and that is probably why she choose it. In a few minutes I was completely silenced and unable to make a single sound. I could hear all the locks being closed all around my head and new that I was now an utterly muted person.

Shannon then walked out of the cell and stopped in front of the cell admiring the penis dildo gag protruding from my face. I was told that this was going to be absolutely priceless for Janice to see the gag and not be able to use it let alone even touch it, while not being able to let me out of our own cell.

I looked at Shannon in horror and disbelief and as if she could read my eyes and mind she then said �Oops&#8217; forgot one last thing and I watched her walk away and return with a lockable blindfold. This blindfold was also specially made; it went with the dildo gag and attached to 6 pegs which protruded from the front of the Dildo Harness. Shannon walked back into the cell and without effort directed the Blindfold portion onto the Dildo Head Harness and proceeded to lock all of the points which included another 6 locks.

I was now in a real mess, I had Handcuffed myself after playing with my wife&#8217;s keys that I was not allowed to do, found, captured, transported and locked securely to a wall of a cell that had no way of being opened without a 6 code number and high security cell door key, gagged, blindfolded and unable to be touched from the women that I love, by Shannon my wife&#8217;s sister.

I was clearly defeated and I think it showed when I struggled for all it was worth against the many devices holding me completely immobile. It was very difficult at that moment when everything came flooding into my brain, but worse, was how hard I still was within the belt.

Shannon not to miss an opportunity told me to stop for just one minute and then I could return to my struggling. I stopped and listened to Shannon tell me to get down on my knees and relax. I was told to relax because I was going to do nothing but harm myself or fall over,� My Day of Fun� had actually just started and considering a day lasts 24 hours it would be a very long day for me.

I was told that I could lie-down if I wanted and get comfortable because it was going to be a very long night as well so I should try to conserve whatever strength I had and I could make it through this.

I was also informed that a new six digit code had been picked by her and if I listened closely I could hear the door close and lock. I did not have to strain to hear the door close and in my disbelief I heard the key of high security lock mechanism engage the frame of the cell with a �thud� meaning it was fully closed and secured. That meant Shannon had properly set the lock mechanism and now there was no way out without her opening the door.

Shannon then went on to tell me that it was now 4:15 and she had turned all the numbers to zero and Janice would be home in about an hour or so. Shannon had stated that she had a couple of more things to prepare before she left for the night. I was told that she enjoyed this opportunity to not only get to find me in such a defenseless position but find out about our playroom and payback two birds with one stone.

I instantly wondered about what she meant by that and was then told what he sinister meaning actually meant. It went something like this, Right around the same time Janice and I became involved, Shannon had been over visiting Janice and was shown the playroom that Janice had made.

Shannon having been younger and more naive was unfortunate enough to have been tricked into placing herself into a set of handcuffs which she was told by Janice anyone could get off with a key. Shannon had tried several times to get the handcuffs off with the cuffs in front and she thought it was no big deal.

Shannon then thought that she could take it one step further and concocted a plan to try real self bondage out for herself. She then placed a set of Hinged Handcuffs onto her ankles after having climbed into the small cage and locking the door with a large padlock.

Shannon then informed me that she had taken another set of hinged cuffs into the cage with her and placed her hands behind her back and then locked her wrists into the Steel Handcuffs. This was a small cage to try out what bondage would feel like and I am sure she got the full effect, but she thought she could get out like Houdini.

Shannon decided that because Janice was not home she could try it out and be free before anyone new what she had done to herself. This sounds all too familiar I thought and Shannon continued to share with me that she believed that she could get the handcuffs off and then open the cage door with the key she had inside the cage with her.

The keyholes to the hinged handcuffs were facing the wrong way and she could not get the Handcuffs off. Maybe this was her fault for not knowing enough about handcuffs, but it was apparent that she got herself stuck and there was no way for her to get released even after trying for an hour with her hands Handcuffed behind her back in Hinged Cuffs, she could not get the door open, even with the key, without Janice letting her out. 

This is what made her so mad, apparently Janice did not come down into the playroom for several hours and Shannon was left to struggle and twist under her own actions causing herself to feel frustrated and embarrassed for what she had done to herself. Shannon swore she would get revenge on Janice, because as it was shared to her later that Janice was home watching her struggle from her room upstairs and was enjoying seeing Shannon not be able to free herself from her own predicament. This was in some way supposed to teach her about playing safely first and having a backup plan for escape should one be required.

Shannon also informed me that although she was severely stuck in the cage and was thoroughly mad at her sister for not releasing her, there was a certain amount of pleasure that went along with it. Being stuck in someone&#8217;s cage and not being able to free yourself when you have the keys is very humbling and it was hard for her to admit that she was extremely turned on by this experience.

Janice had figured out that Shannon was enjoying herself more than she wanted to admit and this was the part that made her anger continue within her predicament. Before agreeing to let her out of the cage when Janice had finally come downstairs to reveal herself to her, she had made her talk about how horny she was and how being in the cage made her really feel. That was the second part of her experience that really made her swear vengeance on Janice. After she shared her inner-most feeling with Janice, she was left in the cage for the night and had to sleep in the exact position that she had placed herself into. 

Shannon had not been tricked once, or twice, but a full three times before gaining her release that she so solemnly earned and deserved the next morning. Tired, sore and worn out from the experience and not to mention having to go to the bathroom the way she did, vengeance was to say the least a reasonable trade for what she endured.

To think that poor Shannon had waited five years for the opportunity to get back at Janice and I was the pawn in her revenge scheme. What did I have to do with any of this, I was tricked in a similar fashion and would be considered a victim the same as Shannon if we really wanted to apply the same rules of engagement that she just used to justify her willful assault of me. Where is my turn to act out I thought, I want to get back at both of them too, how dare they make me pay for sisterly love, right!, it is just not fair and I attempted to free myself by pulling on the restraints that held me so firmly in the position that currently held me in the cell.

Shannon then stated something that I doubt I will ever forget, she informed me that at the strike of twelve midnight she will be calling Janice to ask her how it feels to have me under the lock and key of another woman namely her sister who she had done the same thing to so long ago and for her to share what she really feels inside about my predicament and situation. I thought that I was apart of a fucking Cinderella movie, what&#8217;s up with this? Can I not get any better treatment here, why do I have to pay?

Shannon told me not to worry about telling Janice what she was up to because she was going to include it in her email which she is going to leave on her pillow for when she gets home. It is not as though I could speak or anything like that with this head harness gag so firmly locked on my head and in my mouth.

I was asked by Shannon if I thought that she should include somewhere in her letter to Janice that I had actually asked her to do this to me because I came on to her in the most utterly inappropriate way? I started shaking my head NO and Shannon then started laughing and stated that I would have to wait and find out what was actually written. Shannon also said that she would think about it and I would probably find out when Janice got home. Maybe Janice would thank her for not putting up with inappropriate actions from her Husband towards her sister, or maybe I would have to wait until I was released to tell Janice what really happened, and there was not even any guarantee if she would believe me or not. Shannon then told me to enjoy my time and enjoy my day and then left the secret room with me chained to the wall, pulling on the handcuffs with no results hoping for release from my wife Janice as soon as possible which would not be likely.

With that sudden departure I was left alone to struggle against the bonds that so firmly held me where I was with the realization that Shannon held the only release for me and that there was absolutely nothing that Janice could do to let me out of her sister&#8217;s snare. I could have cried, but what would the point have been, I was completely beaten into total submission, this is kind of what I wanted for my day, but not with this twist that caused me to be so completely helpless and untouchable by Janice.

I struggled as best I could; given my position, I imagine that it could have been much worse. I was not uncomfortable, just restricted to a very short leash chained to the wall, my hands were not numb, my arms did not hurt, and my legs could be stretched. My Mouth was well used to this gag and I have worn it for several hours at a time so I was not afraid of getting a sore jaw, I new full well that if Shannon went through with her plan that I probably would be here until tomorrow and that I could do this position without fear of falling apart or having an extreme panic attack that could not be dealt with.

This did not make me feel any better about the situation, it just gave me the pausing effect that I needed to process my predicament and calculate the time lines that I would need to keep everything in perspective to get through this experience. It was ironic that when I finished processing all this information that I felt myself inside the tube of the Chastity belt to start growing and throbbing at my new found arousal. If there was anything that was going to make this bad for me it was if I started getting turned on to the point where I would not receive any physical gratification, even from the smallest touch or attention. I was used to being restrained and teased, but this time Janice would be completely powerless to change my circumstances to fit her own agenda or needs.

I think this was where things started to change for me, it was that Janice was out of the loop on this scenario and would have to struggle through watching me not be able to get free, or for her to have some control over the events which would be taking place right in front of her. 

God I found this to be very arousing and the more I thought about it the more turned on I became. Janice would probably for the first times in her life not have control, and this would be the first time in our relationship of over five years that she would not have absolute control over me. I was almost as hard as I have ever been inside the belt and as I tried to relieve the pressure I could only struggle against the unforgiving steel which caused me to be even more aroused. What a cycle, round and round I went for how long I don&#8217;t know, but I new that Janice would be getting home any time now and I would then have to struggle through even more emotional challenges, so I tried to just settle down and wait for the inevitable to arrive.

Time can often pass so slowly or move so fast that one can&#8217;t believe where the time went. This was one of those situations, knowing that Shannon had informed me that it was 4:15 before she had left meant that I had anywhere from 1 hour to 1.5 hours to wait. I must have not had any track of time because I was startled by the bookshelf door opening which meant that Janice must now have been home and was coming down to check on me which I was hoping was a good thing, not knowing what Shannon had left in her letter to Janice.

I didn&#8217;t have to wait long because Janice walked up to the cell bars and must have crouched down because her voice was at the same level that I was, which was close to the floor. I could smell her perfume and new that I was now OK, my wife was there for me and would protect me from Shannon should she&nbsp; come back and try anything else which she was not allowed to do to me.

Janice then spoke to me and stated �Michael I read your letter and understand why you asked Shannon to do this to you, I am very disappointed in you and more hurt than anything�, I also read the letter that Shannon left for me but I didn&#8217;t understand what she means by it.

I do agree with Shannon that you deserve to be in here for what she says you have done, but I don&#8217;t understand why she wants me to be awake and speak with her at midnight. She said it was very important and that she has more to tell me and I will have to wait until then to find out, something about revenge is best served cold, not that you can speak Michael, do you have any idea what she is talking about, if yes just nod your head.

With that Janice also went on to say that she is glad that she cannot touch me or enter the cell and that she is glad that Shannon has locked me up in the state that I am in because of what I had done, not that she would not tell me what I had done, I could only lay there cuffed as I was listening to this absolute nightmare. Shannon had lied and Janice was believing her and there was absolutely no way for me to communicate that I had done nothing wrong, I was getting deeper into this revenge game than I had wanted to be, I could only hope that at midnight Shannon would tell Janice the truth and my nightmare would end, I could only struggle for release and midnight was now close to 6 or seven hours away, could I make it, as if I had a choice.

I tried as best as I could to communicate, but nothing came out that even resembled a word, just snorting and grunting was all I could muster, I decided to resign myself to this fate and get a chance later to share with Janice that this was all a lie. I put my head back down and listened to Janice tell me how things were going to go for me.

I was told that there was no greater betrayal to her than what I had committed today and I will be severely punished for this act that I committed against Shannon, and that she was looking forward to speaking with her at midnight to get the full understanding of what actually occurred. I was told that Shannon would be given the choice of punishments on me and would be the only one who was going to release me from the cell with Janice&#8217;s full blessing and support of her decision making abilities.

Janice then told me I should get very comfortable or expect to be released soon and I should take the time and think about how I should change my ways about trying to handcuff her younger sister with a tricked pair of handcuffs.

What the hell was this? I didn&#8217;t do that, I am the victim here was all I could think, but I would not have the opportunity to share that for some time and it was better to not react than to show any guilt through trying, and with that Janice got up and left the room the same way she came in. 

I new that in time the truth would come out and for whatever reason Shannon decided to go this route, I new she was up to something far more sinister than what she had told me about and I would have to just wait until midnight to find out the next installment of my experience in total submission. What a day this had been so far, and I am sure it I will be the last to find out about what is going to happen next, so I lay here struggling against the steel bonds holding me a prisoner by my wife&#8217;s younger sister waiting for midnight to shed light on what will lay in store for me later. I await my future.
