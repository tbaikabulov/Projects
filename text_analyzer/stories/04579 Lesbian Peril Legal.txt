LESBIAN PERIL LEGAL 

&nbsp;

By Michelle Makens

&nbsp;

Chap. 1

&nbsp;

A preference choice to
continue a small but somewhat lucrative law practice with L.P.L Brokerage &amp;
Defense (known only to a chosen inner circle as Lesbian Power Legal B&amp;D)
easily fulfilled my secular desirers and soon became more rewarding in many
ways. With the shared caseloads and practical billable hours, things were less
hectic as the overall workweek schedule helped open up my personal time for
many other more interesting pursuits. 

&nbsp;

But with this ideal
situation came the off set of taking on an additional administrative position
as their office manager. I suppose it did seem (as things were) the perfect
image to my own well-defined dominant private life style, as you will discover.


&nbsp;

To dismiss any doubt, this
decision did not come about completely by chance and was primarily due to the
mutual fact that the firm's main controlling partners were all very well to do
female professional lawyers who were openly lesbian women by nature. Perhaps a
minor exception to this statement was the seven other thirty something year old
female associates who were, in their own different ways, very much involved in
the fem/fem scene. Some of these who lean more towards the kink and B&amp;D fetish,
I have in the short passing of time, made very personal or intimate acquaints
with. All of these women are very appealing; well above average in looks,
physically fit and knowingly turned in the same circles. 

&nbsp;

Oh, I suppose there is one
other smaller exception as far as the rest of the office, which has been by no
strange coincidence very well staffed with many other beautiful young women.
Most of these however remained somewhat clue-less and are employed in various
assistant positions.

&nbsp;

Now as for myself, there
has never been a need for exaggeration or any reason to be modest, as my own
physical appearance has always proven to be very eye catching, being an
especially tall statuesque female, (almost 6 foot 1 in bare stocking feet). So
then when I am dressed in heels and wearing my long amber hair high up on my
head in a tightly pinned swirled bun, well this easily gives me a desired
intrinsic look of status. Authoritative and controlling has always been my featured
feminine allure. 

&nbsp;

In preparation for my
d�but, when I initially greeted they�re exclusive female staff, everything had
been carefully arranged in just the right manner. Perhaps it was meant to be
dramatic and even more so shocking when I first walked into the office,
pretentiously daunting my shapely hourglass figure, long legs, smooth full
hips, a streaming waist line and amply cleavage revealed above my bosoms. I was
unquestionably stunning and a little intimidating to most of the younger women.
This fact was quickly realized even before they found me out to be an extremely
dominant minded and out spoken female. 

&nbsp;

Given my pronounced
dominating appearance and the obscure fact of being totally immersed in a
relatively kinky life and lesbianism might go on to explain my more decisive
behavior in dealing with some of the more flippant and incorrigible girls
working there in the office. It had not taken long for some of these female
subordinates to conjure reasons to dislike me, although it was usually only the
small matter of insisting that they be more diligent. My decidedly stricter
manner soon came to the attention of Ms. Cynthia Mills, one of the older senior
partners (forty three to be precise). So maybe several weeks had past when Ms.
Mills approached me after just such an incident. I was seated by my self
reading a Grecian novel there quietly in the lunchroom when she asked me to
please step into her office later on that afternoon so she could have a word
with me. 

&nbsp;

As I neared the reception
area to her office just after 1:13,
we met by chance of circumstance, just as it appeared she was walking back into
the office from her assistance�s desk. As I followed her in, it became quite
noticeable that she had kept her rather slim though perfect figure and seemed
to be very well endowed for a woman her size. Even in her accustom style and
modest manner of dress, she easily boasted a lovely (C cup) mantle, enticing to
say the least. Typically she wore her slightly graying, straight shoulder
length hair parted in the middle. This was in addition to keeping the sides
pulled back on ether side of her head, holding it there were two simple
barrettes. Surprisingly in a more suitable way, this somewhat younger
hairstyle, a little out of place with her maturity, made such a grade school thought
femininely attractive and perfectly forbidden (so adolescently sinful and
delicious). Actually, I found Cynthia to be a very pleasant female to study as
we both stood inside her office near the partially ajar door. 

&nbsp;

Regretfully she had begun
(to some degree) by openly admonishing me. As I suspected, there had been some
petty grievances voiced by anonymous sources after one of my reprimands. But just
shortly after Ms. Mills started with her small verbal slap on the wrist (and as
if on cue) we both attentively noticed the somewhat subtle eavesdropping of her
rather cute brunette secretary Ann. In light of this frank observation, the
door was closed and on her subsequent return, Ms Mills made a rather curious
apologetic amends. �Cynthia� (as I was later corrected by her) continued in a
hushed voice as she went on to actually commend me on my very much needed
administrative actions. 

&nbsp;

With this she then
curiously entrusted me with something and was hopeful that I could take care of
a certain delicate office matter. Cynthia Mills was quite blunt when saying
that there had been a few annoying accounting thefts and felt it would be more reasonable
to delegate this to someone possessing a certain subtle manner in discretion.
Such things as having only accusing suspicions or confronting one of committing
a theft could be a means for unnecessary counter suits without having more facts
and documented proof.

&nbsp;

To date, she informed me,
there were only small but consistently recurring accounting errors and other
trifling discrepancies. Cynthia needed (she felt) a person technically advanced
(such as myself) who possessed such a strong-handed secular judgment. I had her
full approval, (although anonymously) to take whatever means necessary with the
suspected female culprit in the department. In a twist of irony, she offered
the woman�s name, one which stood out in my mind. Yes there the girl was again boldly
on top of my list underlined in red. 

&nbsp;

Even before Cynthia
finished with her hushed implications, this rather garish and adolescent behaved
twenty three year old (Miss Valerie Anne Johnson) loomed vividly in my mind. It
had only been a short time ago since our last little exacerbating discussion, the
ones which I often had with this little high nosed Miss. 

&nbsp;

Actually it had come to the
point of my thinking that what this unceasingly truant and sassy little
up-start needed was a good firm guiding hand in her life. That is, one of my
own swatting at that nice pert cheeky bottom of hers. It was seemingly obvious to
me that it would take nothing less then a true corporal reprimand to make Miss
Johnson act like a reasonable and responsible adult young woman in my eyes. 

&nbsp;

Even when she was in proper
attendance, it always seemed such a chore for her to share in some of the more
menial office tasks. If she did anything, it was usually accompanied with her
infuriating girlish whining and endless complaining prattle, which would soon
be infused with her indecorous manner. I found Miss Johnson�s personal persona
to be flagrantly intolerable, although in a way it was a natural fit to her
outward physical semblance. She was a perfectly matched and stereotypical
petite blonde female who possessed a very childishly superior attitude and
seemed in dire need of a little discipline she sorely missed in her youth
obviously. 

&nbsp;

I suppose Miss Johnson�s
rather youthful looking appearance (along with her manner) could be partially
contributed to her fair skin, which showed a few light tan freckles on each
cheek. She did have adorable pale blue eyes and a very slim, although shapely
girlish figure. Her hair (blonde) actually varied with light sandy colors,
being long in length. Aside from a few various chosen styles, it stayed for the
most part long and naturally straight. When it was pulled back into a ponytail,
(which was more so then not) Valerie's small delicate facial features made her
look a bit like a teenager. 

&nbsp;

Yes she was virtually just
a very young, spoiled, undisciplined, disrespectful, ill-mannered girl in my
thoughts. And despite her undisputable adult age, I still found it rather satisfying
to picture Valerie dressed in a shamefully uncomfortable outfit. Of course any
sensible young woman would feel self-conscious while wearing such things like a
pleated skirt which came up almost panty high. This I thought would only fade
in comparison to a very naughty and extremely tight fitting blouse. But alas her
indiscretion would never be tolerated and there would certainly be serious
consequences for a young woman in such an errant state of dress. My imagined demonstration
of her shameful little costume and delinquency would surly have to end when
Valerie found herself practically stripped out of her panties as she was bent over
in the little schoolgirl uniform and spanked on her bare bottom.

�

As you can see, I have
caught myself fantasizing for sometime over how she needed to be punished like
this often imagined troublesome pigtailed girl.

&nbsp;

But continuing on, I
started my diligent inquires one evening after office hours, going over the
particular errant accounts and some corporate investment portfolios. Some other
less tedious endeavors that seemed more fruitful and enlightening, were spent
researching Miss Johnson's past and more insignificant juvenile misdeeds. An
intriguing note was the recent publicly declared Will of Betty Anna Johnson, which
became more then just an interest to me. Valerie's recently deceased stepmother
had left her as the legally adopted child of her small dwindled estate. Yes it
was on public record that the woman had adopted Valerie as an infant.

&nbsp;

My enthusiastic persistence
in Valerie Johnson's life had only left me with a few possible fraudulent
investments. A hand full of account numbers and names of various corporations,
which I made a disk copy of after coming across them in a file marked for personal
receipts; it was really less then nothing.

&nbsp;

During the following few
weeks of being foiled by whatever clever little pilfering and investment scheme
she had contrived, made my own personal demeanor grow to that of a caged
tigress in heat. 

&nbsp;

Sorely smitten with these
pinned frustrations and my paralleling aggravation of very horny hormonal desires,
I finally made the resolve to play a little cat and mouse game with this
audacious little shrew. 

&nbsp;

Needless to say, being in
this state of mind I was more then ready for a little diversion and had already
packed my bag for a rather sorted weekend. This came right after a daring
decision to dressing myself less conservatively that same morning. My mind was
primarily focused on the excitement of my ritual weekend hunt that I frequently
made around the less known lesbian bars and clubs. In any case, I came into the
office that Friday morning ready to kill metaphorically, consciously exuding a
sexual eminence as my projected appearance seemed a little scant although still
totally business like.� It was sometime late
that afternoon when I catered to my thoughtful plan of having Miss Valerie
Johnson step into my office for a private chat. There could only be, however, a
cautious pawing with an instinctive cat-like wit and my knowing soul-piercing
stares. Nothing more would be used other then the lone black diskette, which
now sat atop a scarlet red folder. In itself, this would seem to be the most
accusing bit of evidence that now lay tellingly in the middle of my desk
blotter. 

&nbsp;

Miss Johnson�s obvious
defiance in promptly heeding my summons might not have seemed that detrimental
to anyone at the time, but it had taunted me even further with her twenty-minute
delay. When she finally paraded in coarsely, Valerie came dressed in a
flawlessly matched 60's retro pink outfit. Other then the white blouse under
her pink two-button waist flared jacket and the white grade-school looking
panty hose, she was Miss-pretty-princess-pink from head to toe; Shoes, skirt,
lapel coat and a perfectly placed powder puff pink scrunchy
holding her long blonde pony-tail. As she was, if it had not been for the slightly
higher then mid thigh tapering skirt and her rather childish looking hairstyle,
which was in unison with the characteristic juvenile mannerisms, I would have
said that she made the whole �Barbie doll� silliness of the thing work
perfectly.

&nbsp;

&quot;Well okay Elisabeth,
you wanted to see me?&quot; 

&nbsp;

She had balanced herself in
between the two front desk chairs, precariously poised in a rather overly done less
sophisticated stance. Valerie's chosen vogue posture had her pivoting heavily
on one pink high heel while she rested her fingertips on the back of either
chair. In this manner she managed to make quite a showy little display of
herself.���� 

� 

&quot;Yes... Although I
prefer not be kept waiting Miss Johnson. Now if you would, please take a
seat.&quot;

&nbsp;

As if I had been graced
merely by her presents there, she consented rather unwilling and sat somewhat
plainly after an obnoxious little eye roll. 

&nbsp;

&quot;I hope this doesn't
take too long because I'm not counting any of this as part of my afternoon
break?&quot;

&nbsp;

Oh, how I loathed that
pompous little attitude of hers. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Well Miss Johnson I'm
sorry to hear that, because I'm afraid what I have to say is of a very serious
nature.&quot; 

&nbsp;

Prudently I watched her
subtle body language and subtle batting eye movements just briefly before
continuing. It was somewhat notable that my statement of being �very serious in
nature� had affected her carefree spirit drastically. Valerie became a lot less
at easy and seemingly more focused on what I had to say. But this was only the
first step in trapping my little blonde cheese-stealing mouse.

&nbsp;

&quot;Are you aware Miss
Johnson of the government penalties for miss handling or falsely appropriated
funds? Freud if you will.&quot;

&nbsp;

Her sweet girlish hush
turned to that of nervous fidgeting and then suddenly erupted into a torrent
out pouring of premature denial and flustered self-righteous ridiculing, which
was followed by her anxious attempt at distancing herself with viability and rather
weak defensive threats. 

&nbsp;

&quot;I don't have the
slightest idea of what you're talking about Elisabeth. ...This is absurd, how
could anyone get away with such a thing? ...You would need proof or else a very
good lawyer.� 

&nbsp;

Clearly, showing such a
complete and utter look of guilt on her face was making my strategic little
mouse catching game far too easy. Picking up the black disk, I casually eased
myself back away from the desk and crossed my legs with a sly look of
confidence.

&nbsp;

&quot;Miss Johnson, I 'am',
as you put it, �a very good lawyer�. One who knows that the penalties in even
the smallest cases can mean mandatory time in prison. Although, I don't recall
actually accusing anyone of anything, do you Miss Johnson?&quot;

&nbsp;

The disk was held in my
hand for her to see.

&nbsp;

&quot;�But if I just
happened to stumble upon a certain file with seemingly false account
information and maybe a few other very incriminating bits of evidence which is
linked to other non-existent corporations. Well then it could certainly be grounds
for at least a very in-depth investigation. Of course at this point, someone
would be temporally dismissed and surly they would need sufficient bound money
depending on the severity of the charges. But by this time, any credibility
they might have would be gone.&quot;� 

&nbsp;

Having finished with this
statement of paradox, I unfurled my legs complacently and placed the disk for
safe keeping in the top desk drawer. I then gave Valerie a very cold searching
look though my eyeglasses that were securely propped down on the bridge of my
nose. She was still trying to recompose herself. Not that I even gave her the
chance.

&nbsp;

&quot;Unfortunately Miss
Johnson, I don't believe that one would need to be so candid in your closely
matched situation. You see, as a woman pretentiously held in an administrative
position; yes, one I might add who is exceedingly accomplished in a win at all
cost profession, has not made it here by letting petty little thieves like you
Miss Johnson go free. Sobbing testimonies and childish tantrums are only silly
little song and dance games young women like to use when skirting they�re way
around the truth. But everything that I need to know about the miss dealings of
you �Miss Valerie Ann Johnson� is right here in this file and on that diskette
in my desk. &quot;

&nbsp;

She was now wearing a very helpless
trapped look, which mimicked that of a lost baby fawn when meeting my own
expressive hard stare. I began once again.

&nbsp;

&quot;With these two
incriminating things safely together in my possession, I will be undoubtedly forced
to bring them to light you see Miss Johnson... &quot;

&nbsp;

There was a slight pause as
I stopped momentarily to remove my ebony rimmed glasses. This was done in the
manner so I could give her a very serious look, and my full assurance that I
was ready to carry this out to the fullest.

&nbsp;

&quot;...That is,
Valerie.� �This all will end in you being
put on trial after the ordeal of being taken into custody. You will be tried
openly and branded as a common thief, which will finally leave you locked away
for quite some time I'm afraid. No one, I can assure you, will show any
sympathy my dear, and I suppose it really should be said that in addition to
your public disgrace, everything you might now possess will certainly be
lawfully seized. I will personally see to that.&quot;

&nbsp;

All through my surreal
telling of her life's coming drama, Valerie tried desperately, although in
vain, to conceal the looming fear which vividly permeated the mood of her
immediate and unknown future. But with its hopeless tragic ending finally told,
it brought her seemingly tearful look of defeat, which was now rather blushing
and fatally cute in those misty blue eyes of hers.

&nbsp;

&quot;W-What do you want,
money?&quot;

&nbsp;

Her audacity, how naive I
thought, although it became obvious that 'little Miss innocent' Valerie Johnson
was unquestionably not so high and mighty now.

&nbsp;

&quot;Oh, should I add
bribery to the list Miss Johnson?&quot;

&nbsp;

The panicked look in her
eyes gave away to all the other once hidden signs of guilt and I calmly watched
as Valerie�s rather thin lucid defense shattered.

&nbsp;

&quot;No, please Elisabeth...&quot;

&nbsp;

Suddenly she stopped and
bit her lower lip thoughtfully, obviously reconsidering her position here. 

&nbsp;

&quot;...Ms. Adams,
please...� I... I don't want to go to
prison.&quot;

&nbsp;

She just sat there now,
sniveling like some confused teenage girl on the other side of the desk,
anxiously perched in the small cushioned chair.

&nbsp;

&quot;And why should that
be any of my concern, Miss Johnson? It seemed quite obvious that you were
certain of your innocents at first, and I do recall you being rather rude and
haughty about it as well. Although that 'was� before you discovered everything
that 'I' know about your unlawful little money game.&quot; 

&nbsp;

She had become the true
parody of a defenseless yearling in my dark shadowy forest hunting ground. I
eased back slowly, shifting my hips intuitively and then nestled my bent arm
casually on one of the cushioned leather rests. While watching her there
adamantly, I propped my chin up on three fingers as the remaining pointer
pressed naturally against one cheek, which now allowed me to confront her
artfully.� 

&nbsp;

&quot;So 'Valerie'... What
would you have me do?&quot;

&nbsp;

As if opening myself to any
of her less likely suggestions, I waited just a moment with my deceptive
anticipation. My inadmissible response had without a doubt left Valerie totally
off guard. She actually sounded sincere with her more desperate offered
promise.

&nbsp;

&quot;I... I don't know...
But I'll do anything you want, anything I swear, please.&quot;

&nbsp;

My sly lighthearted reply
was made in a very disbelieving manner.

&nbsp;

&quot;Oh really...
Anything... I find that very hard to believe Valerie.&quot;

&nbsp;

This false glimmer of
willingness on my part to even explore her absurd offer any further made her become
even more reckless and frantic.

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes, I'll do whatever
you want, anything.&quot;

&nbsp;

I crossed my legs again and
went on with my deliberate intentions of making her elaborate in full.

&nbsp;

&quot;Well then, tell me my
dear, what does 'anything' mean exactly? I'm actually very curious to hear,
really.&quot;

&nbsp;

Valerie's eyes dropped down
hesitantly; as if to watch her fingers fumble somewhat rigidly in her lap.

&nbsp;

&quot;I-It means anything,
whatever you want me to do Ms. Adams... Please.&quot;

&nbsp;

There wasn't any reason to
play this silly guessing game of hers a minute longer.

&nbsp;

&quot;Well then, 'anything'
or 'whatever' must mean, if I understand you correctly Valerie, is that you
would be willing to become my personal full time servant girl; is that what
you're saying?&quot;

&nbsp;

Her eyes shot up and she
looked at me with an unfounded show of utter disbelief. My acknowledgment to
this over dramatized reaction was one of simply setting my glasses back on the
end of my nose as I replied�

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes, I see... &quot;

&nbsp;

�And then reaching directly
for the phone's receiver.

&nbsp;

&quot;.... It seems that we
have nothing more to discuss Miss Johnson.&quot;

&nbsp;

Valerie found herself half way
over my desk as she instinctively leaped to stop me from dialing the phone.

&nbsp;

&quot;No wait,
please.&quot;

&nbsp;

Demonstrating that she had
severely crossed the line of my patients, I glared at her angrily and then
snapped sharply...

&nbsp;

&quot;Sit down Miss.
Johnson!&quot;

&nbsp;

It was only after she had
obeyed my firm demand and slinked back down into her chair that I lowered the
receiver back onto its cradle.

&nbsp;

&quot;Should I consider
that childish out-burst as a sign of your full agreement now Miss
Johnson?&quot;

&nbsp;

As if I had actually given
her room for any further choice or debate, Valerie continued to dawdle in
giving me her answer in the affirmative. It appeared that she had also found a
little backbone once again and her audacious subtle charm.

&nbsp;

&quot;How do I know that
you won't have me arrested anyway after I do what you want 'E-lez-a-beth'.&quot;

&nbsp;

Oooo, she needed to have that smirk slapped right off her
face. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Well, as I see it...'
Sweetness', (she was really going to regret that playful little name game one
way or another) you really haven't been given any other assurances beside the
one of me 'allowing you' to become my servant, or rather, �slave�. Keeping my
promise of not having you arrested will be entirely up to you, 'My Dear'. I'm
only offering amnesty in allowing you a choice to be my personal slave girl,
but you alone will make that decision for yourself.&quot;

&nbsp;

Of course I was going to
make certain that there would be little other choice in this matter when
putting it more business like.

&nbsp;

&quot;Now Miss Johnson, you
have wasted enough of my time... IS IT YES OR NO?&quot;

&nbsp;

Valerie piddled about in
her newfound feelings of humility after she finally gave me her response in the
affirmative, and I was right there to shove her nose deep into it when she actually
did.

&nbsp;

&quot;...Yes.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;THAT WOULD BE, �YES
MS ADAMS�.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;�Yes, Ms Adams.&quot;

&nbsp;

Granting her impunity from
any form of embarrassment or civil punishment was far from my mind at this
point. With another meaningful look, she was instructed to get down on her
hands and knees. I wanted to see her totally humiliated while crawling around
the desk to me. This would put her in the proper position as well to beg me if
she could be my slave. Of course Valerie was very resistant to the idea of this
at first. That is until I got up and made a straight line towards the door as
if to escort her out. But I only found myself locking it after her sudden
awkward compliance. As soon as I returned to my desk, I clicked on a few
desktop icons before telling Valerie that she now had my permission to make her
wishes perfectly clear to me. She did so after the short crawl to my chair and
in a rather small apprehensive voice she began. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Please Ms Adams, m-my
I please be your slave girl.&quot;

&nbsp;

I smiled briefly at her
miserable attempt at being even vaguely sincere with such an outrageous request
and then more thoughtfully began working my blue dress up around my hips.
Valerie's eyes grow wider as she saw my white lacy stocking garter and lesser
string thong panties coming into full view.��


&nbsp;

&quot;Yes you may be my
slave Valerie; however I do expect you to show me a little more sincerity then
just your request.&quot; 

&nbsp;

She was warned of the
consequences of not obeying as she watched me lift both my legs over ether
armrest, going on to spread them more suggestively when pulling the thin crouch
panel of my panties over to one side.

&nbsp;

&quot;Now be a good slave
girl Valerie and come lick my pussy.&quot;

&nbsp;

Giving Valerie a devilishly
evil grin, I beckoned her to me with the curling white French tip of my
forefinger. She was being sluggish and rather reluctant in crawling towards my
eager waiting muffin but soon Valerie managed to snuggle into my parted thighs
as the soft pointed tip of her tongue brushed timidly between the open lips of
my outward flowered sex. Even though this may have been physically new and
unnatural for her in the beginning, she unquestionably learned rather quickly
just how to please another woman. 

&nbsp;

Her increasingly silky and more
arousing persistence eventually found the true mark as she teased my clitoris
with little stiff fluttering flicks. Aside from this intoxicating stimulation,
there was a certain unlikely thought that she was actually totally unwilling in
all this, which soon had me swooning and moaning with pleasure. It appeared to
incite her as she then forced her tongue deeper into me. Mindlessly I grabbed Valerie
head and her own gasping breathes became more labored and frenzied as she
probed my gushing pink tunnel which soon sent me up over the edge and into a
sky exploding orgasmic show of ecstasy. Oh yesss...� 

&nbsp;

&quot;Uh-uh-uhmmmmmmmmmmm... OHOOooooooooooooooooo��

&nbsp;

I slowly regained control
and came back down to reality.

&nbsp;

�That was intensely
adequate Valerie, and very surprising for someone who has never even thought of
pleasing another woman before.&quot;

&nbsp;

There was nothing said of
any consequence in reply, other then her stifled unintelligible groaning and
sallow panting as I finished by rubbing Valerie's nose into my fuzzy oozing
sex. She was released from between my legs and pushed back with just a stiff
finger to one shoulder. It left her kneeling there at my feet looking rather
inept after she had landed back against the heel spikes of her pink leather
pomp's. 

&nbsp;

In this compromising
position, my sad and sticky face little princess and her insistent airs of
proper morals now visibly vanished as I watched her shamefully smear my
proverbial ripe peach juices from her moistened glistening lips and chin. She
kneeled there fighting back her impish inner demons as I straightened my
panties and made my outward appearance much more ladylike again. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Wipe your face with a
few tissues Valerie, and then go start cleaning out your desk immediately. You
may tell the other girls anything you wish, but as of this moment, you have
knowingly resigned and will be leaving this office like a well behaved pet with
your owner.&quot;

&nbsp;

Again Valerie had managed
to regain a little of her dignity and quickly got back on her high horse as she
gave me a smoldering angry look for making her out as nothing more then a pet.
Of course this was only going to get this furious little sprite my personal
added efforts in humiliating her further. It was going to be deliciously fun (I
thought) breaking my stubborn little nymphet of her free spirited ways by making
her ride a narrow wooden beam of my own erotic design. I would enjoy spurring such
a vivacious filly on with my tasseled buggy whip while she is hangs up by her
wrists. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Well now... Are we
having any second thoughts Miss Johnson?&quot;

&nbsp;

This inquiry however was
the only prodding she needed at that moment to get Valerie back up on those
pretty pink shoe tips and heading with new meaning out the door. 

�

When it was obediently closed
behind her, I thought to call Ms Miller and let her know of Valerie Johnson's
consensual dismissal. I briefly went over the impartial and amicable reasons for
this action and my decision in dropping any subsequent charges (little did she
know) and Miss Johnson would agree to sign any waivers and a letter saying she
would be responsible for making restitution. Cynthia seemed happy to leave the
matter in my hands and thanked me for handling it so professionally and
discreetly. 

&nbsp;

While wearing my own knowing
little smile, I reached back along the desk and hang up the phone.� Reveling in this cleverly mastered
achievement, I crossed my legs in such a manner so they pinched my hot heated
sex very tightly. 

&nbsp;

Oh yes, some things feel
amazingly wonderful when they come together so very nicely with just a pinch of
a females professional� intuition indeed.
