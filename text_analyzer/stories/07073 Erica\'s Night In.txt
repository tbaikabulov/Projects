Erica\'s Night In
Provided By: BDSM Librarywww.bdsmlibrary.com
Synopsis: It was another exhausting day for Erica. A Bath and a Diet coke was all she wanted. But low and behold another package has arrived. Being an MVP subscriber, it was her job to test whatever product was in the package and review it. what is this one? 






 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Erica came straight home after work. She was tired and wanted nothing more then a nice, long, hot soak in the bath tub. She came into the lobby on the main floor of her apartment building and checked in with the foreman for her mail. She'd lived there long enough to already know the middle-aged, scruffy man by his first name, Jeff.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good evening, got anything for me today?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Um, lets see.� He checked behind him at the cubbies, some having loads of mail, some a little bit and some still none. �Yes, I do.� He pulled a stack of envelopes from one cubby and handed them to her. �Oh, and you have a package, too.� He reached under the counter and pulled up a brown-wrapped cube, almost too large for her to carry. �Its heavy, so good luck trying that one on the stairs with your briefcase and everything.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I'll manage.� Erica gave her most polite and professional &#8216;thank-you&#8217;s, then headed up the steps to the fifth floor. She set the package on the floor by her door and unlocked it, taking everything inside, and setting the box down again on the table along with her briefcase. Her first order of business was to get out of those stupid heels! She kicked them off and under the table, then walked over to the fridge for a diet coke. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For a minute she leaned against the counter at her empty, one-room apartment. How she wished someone lived with her! Someone to come home to and love her. But alas, that won't be for some time to come if at all. She had always thought men were put off by her successful career, being Vice President of a company that was elbowing its way up as a competitor of even the great Starbucks and Brewed Awakenings! And because of her high position, she wouldn't have a boyfriend, a husband or even a family that she once dreamed of. No matter, she told herself, I run a great life, and she then proceeded to the bathroom, picking up her reading book on the way. Setting her coke and book by the head of the tub, she filled it up with hot water and threw in a few bath salts.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She began to undress the rest of her clothes; Her nude colored stockings, her solid emerald-green skirt, and matching blazer, and her stainless white blouse, until she stood in only her undergarments in front of the bathroom mirror. Seeing herself, she had the thought that she wasn't unattractive at all. She had dark curly hair that framed her round, delicate face, with her almond colored eyes and creme colored skin. Her breasts weren't small, no, a 34 c has been known to attract their share of men, if not for a while, at least for a night. And if it wasn't her breasts that gave her one night stands once, maybe twice yearly when she choose it, it was her legs, firm and toned; in the right heels they were killers.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In any case she proceeded in removing the rest of her clothes and slipped into the tub. She pinned up her hair, away from the water and sank deeper into the blissful state that the hot water granted her. She took one more drink of her coke, and picked up her book, letting the water relax her muscles, and the words relax her mind.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For an hour she lay there, calmly, until she started to prune. She got up and wrapped a towel around herself, going back to the front area and her mail. Two bills, some junk mail, and postcard from her mom three states away. Nothing too exciting. She left the mail on the table, then went over to the package. She was very, very familiar with the company-Blue Caribbean- and was on the VIP list. Basically that meant they could send her prototypes of the latest stuff that she would check out, and only had to pay shipping and a review of the artifact. Seeing as how she hadn't ordered anything from them for a month, it must be a prototype. She took out the letter first, blah blah blah, thank you for signing up, blah blah, check out our other offers, blah blah blah, $10 shipping fee... 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She opened the box to find another one, this one pure white with a serial number on it and the words �some assembly required�. A smile came to her lips as she pulled it out and took it to her bed room. At the foot of the bed, she dumped out the contents, two long poles, both with cuffs at the end, a large metal box with three holes, no doubt for the two previous poles, and a third pole with a large rubber dildo on the end. She set it up and looked quickly at the directions. There was a remote on the box to be detached, and the batteries were already installed it said. It described in little and professional detail the use of the machine, and that instantly got sweet Erica excited. She sat up on the bed, putting one ankle in the specified cuff, and pressing her pussy, well on its way to getting wet, against the head of the dildo softly, then hooked up the other cuff. That alone felt good. It had been too long since she had masturbated, and she was well overdue. Of course, she could still do with some relaxing, so she took the remote and fixed it to the lightest settings. It began working instantly, slowly, gently, pressing about an inch into her and then pulling back out.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh god, that felt good. She fell back on her pillows and put her arms up to the headboard. A few years and 2 boyfriends ago, she'd had a mechanic who was a Sex fiend. He'd installed on her bed cuffs, much like what was used during the times of the colonalizing of America. She eagerly snapped them in, knowing if ever it was needed, she'd have her emergency escape from them.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her towel by now had gotten loose, and for the sake of excitement, she squirmed a little to get it to let her free. She was now nude, her legs held a good four or five feet apart by a machine that was dildo-fucking her, the remote by her head and her hands attached to the headboard, what a sight to see, she thought.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The feeling was seductive, but all too soon she calmed down. She was ready to sleep almost. There was a cramp in her shoulder and she twitched, knocking the remote off her bed. It hit face down on her floor and the machine kicked into gear for real now. At a speed of almost 10 miles per hour, it was jolting in and out of her, pressing about 7 and a half of the full ten inch dildo in to her. Sweet Jesus, that felt great! She squirmed and was brought to an orgasm right away.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This wasn't enough for her, she kept going, kept it running, she could take it, she could take it twice as much, she thought. She began to moan and within the next five minutes had another orgasm. This continued on for about an hour and three or four more orgasms. She was getting spent, but the machine kept pounding with the same force. She was almost ready to pull out of the head board when there was a spark somewhere by the machines base. Now she knew why the dildo was rubber, protection from shocks. Too bad, she thought. Then there was another shock and the machine lost all control. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It jolted again, twice as fast, now the full ten inches, faster and faster. Another spark, and it nearly stopped, leaving her on the edge. It kept spasming, the machine, from fast to slow, and hard and soft, and all the various places in between. It was too much for her. She began to yell, glad that her walls were sound-proof from the rest of the world. It brought her to more orgasms then she could count that night, and kept going. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had hooked it up and started the machine at about 7, and it was still going well into 10 pm. At midnight it was running, and by about 1:30 it finally stopped, the batteries dead. Erica dropped everything, and finished her round of orgasm and laid back, dropping her head to one side and closing her eyes. She breathed deeply for a good ten minutes before unhooking her wrists from the headboard and then her ankles. Still she didn't take the dildo out. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She laid there for a little while longer, starting to get hungry.&nbsp; She released the rubber mass and tried to stand, her knees weak. Using the wall as her guide, and picking up the towel to wipe her crotch, she finally made her way to the kitchen, where she fell upon the counter before putting a T.V. Dinner into the microwave. She also grabbed one more soda, and once finished with her meal, went back to the bedroom to clean up her bed and the dildo. This being done, she wasn't quite ready for bed anymore, so, picking up the letter from the box, she sat down at the coffee table and began her review of the machine.
