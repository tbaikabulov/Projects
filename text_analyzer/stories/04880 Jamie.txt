Jamie was a good kid. She graduated from high school, the
first in her family. Her older sister hadn�t been seen for about a year, and
her father; he was gone since before she could remember. Her mom persevered,
working long hours so her children could have a future. Then, one day, she
decided not too. Jamie could remember the day a social worker stopped by to
tell her that her mom died of an overdose. Jamie flipped out, mostly from
panic, and started yelling at the social worker. He got angry, told her she was
white trash, and left. The next month Jamie enrolled at a public university.
They paid almost all of her tuition; she was expected to pay the rest through
work study programs. Jamie was ready to start life over and forget the past.

&nbsp;

She got the forgetting part
down all right. Overwhelmed after only the first two weeks, she discovered the
joy of, well, forgetting. By going to parties. First a couple on the weekends, just to chill, yknow?
Then she got a little more serious and discovered the curious phenomenon that
Wednesday really far from the weekend to come, and at the same time a really
far away from the previous weekend. The answer? Well,
it was a good idea at the time. She began using any substance she could get her
hands on. She would wake up in strange places, not sure where she was, or more
importantly, where her clothes were.

&nbsp;

Needless to say, her grades
stank. The days that she actually showed up to class she had such a big
hangover she couldn�t see straight. She got kicked out of the extremely demanding
job of sitting in the library for two hours a week, mostly because she didn�t
come. Not that anyone really noticed; it was really her own fault she lost the
job by coming in an hour late and getting fired 5 minutes later when they
discovered she hadn�t been there before, ever. 

&nbsp;

It wasn�t a happy time for
Jamie. She was having sex with people she never even saw, doing things she
couldn�t remember. Not that she wanted to remember it, but still. Something had
to change. And it did.

&nbsp;

At the end of the semester
she sat down opposite some dean or other. The dean politely informed her that
she would be a probationary student the next semester, and if she didn�t
achieve at least a B-, the university would have the pleasure of kicking her
out. This wasn�t news to Jamie, but it was the only time she heard it sober and
not hung over. It was winter break and most of the other party goers had either
been hospitalized indefinitely, or went home. Jamie was shocked to discover she
didn�t actually know anyone on campus, the only people she knew were the ones
at all the parties, which, it later dawned on her, was a haven for all the
ex-student rejects.

&nbsp;

When the next semester
started, Jamie was determined to give it one last shot. She would actually try
her hardest. Make something of her life. It didn�t help that when she looked in
the mirror she looked almost exactly like her sister. 

&nbsp;

Although she would have
gotten an A and maybe even a gold star for effort, she was struggling. She
wasn�t used to working, to actually applying herself. But it was more than
that. She didn�t know the basics that you were supposed to absorb from high
school. And she had no one to help her. 

&nbsp;

It was actually her
pre-calc professor that saved her. Frustrated with the class, she decided that
today they would experiment with a new form of learning that didn�t involve the
teacher. They would all pair up and answer each other�s questions while the
teacher �observed�. Most people either knew everything and
just spent the time socializing. The rest, well, there weren�t so many of
those. Most of the girls had to somehow find a way to convert a nerds lecherous
staring into a source of answers. The dumb studs didn�t even bother trying to
figure it out. 

&nbsp;

Jamie had a different
problem. The class had an odd number of students, and, since everyone naturally
paired up with someone, she was left out. She had a problem talking to random
people, and random people had a problem with her. She was �too� hot. No guy
would risk talking to her; they all figured she already had her boytoy. The more confident studs already had their blondes
in tow, and Jamie was left somewhere in their wake. Luckily, the teacher had a
brilliant solution. Why not let the TA discuss things with her? She didn�t much
like him, and he looked like he noticed that she was trying her hardest not to
teach. That should teach the kid.

&nbsp;

Jamie was too embarrassed
to ask any questions. The TA�s name was Gary, and she enjoyed discreetly staring at him during
lecture. After the humiliation of answering �who doesn�t have a partner?�, she was just too startled when Gary sat down next to her and asked her if she had any
problems. Hell yes she had problems. Only she just turned red, mumbled
something, and shook her head. 

&nbsp;

Gary wasn�t convinced, and since the old hag was going to
make him stay the hour anyway, he opened the book and decided to ask this skanky little kid some questions. She tried her best to do
the problem, but to no one�s surprise, got it totally wrong and almost started
crying. Gary was gentle; he pointed out what she had gotten wrong
and discovered she didn�t have a clue. He started explaining some of the more
basic concepts, and just as Jamie was starting to get it, everyone stampeded
out of the room. He gave her a number and asked her to call him later, when she
had more time. Just wanted to help the poor kid out, but when he handed her the
number she almost had a heart attack.

&nbsp;

Jamie practically ran out
of the classroom. She couldn�t concentrate in her next class. Or the one after. It was really her loss; the professor
discussed in painful detail exactly what was on the next exam, but her mind was
elsewhere. Deep down she knew how lucky she was that he even cared. 

&nbsp;

Later that evening Jamie
and Gary got together and had a very mature, exciting conversation on pre-calc;
or more exactly, a discussion of everything you should have known before you
took pre-calc. After the first hour Jamie was comfortable enough to ask him
direct questions, and for the first time actually felt like she learned
something. And on top of all that, no other skinny little blonde showed up and
held hands with Gary while he apologized profusely about how he had to go, He was there for her, as long as she wanted. 

&nbsp;

They departed at a
conservative 8
 pm with an agreement to meet
up again the next day. As it turned out, Gary was quite good at all the subjects she was taking,
and since she was the polar opposite, he offered to help. 

&nbsp;

They began to see each
other every day. To study. Jamie needed that much help
from a guy like Gary, and he evidently didn�t have much to do with his
time. With his help, Jamie actually got a B+ on her exams. It was her first B
in a very, very long time. And in the mid-semester probationary meeting, the
dean unhappily informed her that, because of her grades, she would be
reinstated as a �full� student. It was the first in a long time, she told
Jamie. �Keep up the good work, and if I see you here again you get the boot.�

&nbsp;

It was the best time of
Jamie�s short life. She had no idea academic achievement could be so exciting,
although to be fair her relationship with Gary quickly became less and less academic. Gary was her guardian angel sent from heaven to help her
when she needed him most, as the saying goes. Like any true alcoholic, she
became dependant on him far sooner than expected.

&nbsp;

The semester ended, but not
before her roommate was arrested. Jamie was in good academic standing, with
higher grades than she ever dreamed possible. And a guy she loved more than
anything in the world. She was high on life.

&nbsp;

Since that was the spring
semester, Gary decided they should go on a trip during the summer.
He saved up enough money from his various TA jobs to afford a low budget romp
of wherever they could afford to go, and, they went. Jamie had never traveled
far outside the town she grew up in, and even the state school was in a
moderately secluded area. She was overawed by everything she saw, which, most
of the time, was Gary. They would be sitting in a train booth carefully
selected because of wide and credible rumors that it was constantly overlooked
by the little french guys in the hats that made you
pay, and Gary would be staring out the window as the Alps
rolled by. Jamie would be staring at Gary and smiling. Such was their trip in a nutshell.
Nutshells crack very easily.

&nbsp;

One morning, Jamie woke up
in a motel. That�s not the point; the difference was that Gary was not there.
Where could he be? Had some evil foreigner who spoke in a weird language all
the preppy kids learned in high school abducted him? Maybe those preppy kids
abducted him! Jamie quickly got up and peeked out the window. No preppy kids
there. She was afraid to go out in case he came back and found her missing. She
just sat on the bed, watching the door, willing it to open with Gary behind it. 

&nbsp;

He came back in 10 minutes
laden with food, but to Jamie it seemed like 10 hours. She got up and hugged
him as soon as he came in, holding him tightly as if it to make sure he never
left again. She never said a word, but she knew Gary understood. Things went back to normal that day, and Gary spent the day sight seeing; Jamie spent the day
watching Gary sight see. 

&nbsp;

The next day, Gary and
Jamie strolled out of the motel they had been in for a week or so. It was an
unusually long time for them to stay in one place, but Jamie didn�t complain.
And they didn�t stroll this time; it was more of a purposeful stride. Gary didn�t look at her as they walked, but Jamie could
feel his hand holding her tightly. At least all was well in one department she
figured.

&nbsp;

They were walking away from
the usual tourist haunts, but that in itself wasn�t too surprising. Gary didn�t like the cliched places you see tourists
standing around open mouthed. They were walking into the slums. Jamie knew
instantly; after all, it was where she grew up Why,
she wondered?

&nbsp;

They came up to a shabby
looking building and Gary knocked on the door. No one answered, so he pushed
the handle and let himself in. It was dark and a little smelly. The place
looked strange with sunlight streaming in through the open door. This was more
the place you would expect to be dark and filled with smoke. It was a seedy
bar.

&nbsp;

There was someone lying on
the floor towards the other end of the bar. Gary silently walked around the bar and into a narrow
hallway, leading Jamie by the wrist. Jamie was scared, mostly because they were
in a place that reminded her strongly of her sister, but also because Gary was acting weird. He didn�t usually hold her by the
wrist that way, and his hand wasn�t usually cold.

&nbsp;

Gary opened at the end of the corridor and looked in with
Jamie peeking in from behind him. He was still holding her by the wrist. There
were two people sitting at a table, one of them staring back at Gary. No one spoke.

&nbsp;

Gary then stepped to the side and shoved Jamie into the
room, resuming his position at the front of the door. She turned around,
shocked, and looked at Gary. He was staring at the Short Guy, who was standing up
now.

&nbsp;

Short Guy stepped forward,
dangerously close to Jamie, so she stepped back. He was standing directly in
front of Gary now. No one said anything yet. The other guy still
sitting at the table, the Drunk Guy, started laughing suddenly and poured
himself another drink. 

&nbsp;

�Deals a deal kid, now get
the hell out of here,� the Short Guy said to Gary and handed him a roll of money. Gary�s face was unreadable as he took the money and
counted it, right there. The Short Guy shifted himself slightly. Jamie was
still standing off to the side, as far away as possible from the Drunk Guy.

&nbsp;

Gary finished counting the money, pocketed it, and folded
his hands. �I can wait, buddy, got all the time in the world,� he told the
Short Guy. 

&nbsp;

The Short Guy fidgeted and
dug some more money out of his pocket, handing it to Gary. 

&nbsp;

Gary put it into his pocket without even looking, and
resumed standing around. 

&nbsp;

�I gave you all you asked
for,� the Short Guy said. No answer from Gary.

&nbsp;

�You didn�t even friggin count it, asshole,� he said. Still
no answer. Short Guy thought for a second, then
punched Gary in the stomach, slamming the door after him. Jamie
screamed. She could hear Gary
hitting the wall and swearing.

&nbsp;

He opened the door again
and discovered he was staring right into Short Guy�s hand gun.

&nbsp;

�I�m giving you one last
chance, kid. Take it or leave it,� he said. Jamie gave one look at the gun and
lunged at Short Guy. She didn�t get far because meanwhile, Drunk Guy had
stealthily gotten up behind her and grabbed her around the waist with both
hands. She screamed again, flailing, and Drunk Guy staggered back, crashing
into the wall behind them. By the time she untangled herself from the floor the
door was shut and Short Guy was putting his piece back in his pocket.

&nbsp;

�W-Where�s Gary?� asked Jamie. She was breathing hard, giving a look
back to see if Drunk Guy had gotten up yet. He was still trying to stand up. 

&nbsp;

Short Guy turned to face
her, stuck out a hand, and said �my name�s Bill.� 

&nbsp;

Jamie shrunk back from his
hand, breathing fast, until Bill elbowed her in the chest. At which point she
sank to the floor unconscious and her breathing normalized. 



&nbsp;



&nbsp;

The
fog lifted slowly as Jamie woke up. Where
am I? How long was I out? She had a throbbing pain in her chest, and she
was hearing voices. Still not moving, she listened to what they were saying. 

&nbsp;

&quot;And
then, WHAM! I hit him in the stomach, and... Hang on, help me with this,&quot; 

&nbsp;

&quot;Yeah
did you see me tackle her? That was slick man, totally.&quot; Jamie felt a
tugging on her wrists. 

&nbsp;

&quot;We
need to get out of here before the kid comes back.&quot; Someone grunted and
she felt the tugging on her wrist again. She opened her eyes and shifted
herself. 

&nbsp;

&quot;...we'll
take the jeep and -&quot; abruptly the talking stopped. Jamie lifted her head
and blinked, adjusting to the light. 

&nbsp;

&quot;S-she's
awake!&quot; The voice brought it all back. Gary! What happened
between them? She sat up and discovered her hands were tied together at the
wrist with a neat little bow tie. Jamie stood up slowly, feeling dizzy and more
than a little nauseated. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Stop! I command you to
stop!&quot; She turned toward the short guy yelling at her. He looked familiar,
but he yelled so loud it hurt... 

&nbsp;

&quot;Who
are you?&quot; she asked. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Call
me Master-&quot; 

&nbsp;

&quot;Bill?&quot;


&nbsp;

&quot;What?&quot;
He seemed more than a little put out, and blushed for a second. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Look,
just sit down like a good kid, ok?&quot; The other guy, the drunk
one, was sitting against the wall, his face red. He looked like he was in the
middle of a nasty hangover. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Where
did Gary go?&quot; she
asked. She knew he had left, but she wouldn't accept it. 

&nbsp;

&quot;That's
his name? He left, honey, now sit down...&quot; 

&nbsp;

&quot;Why?&quot;
Jamie could feel her eyes filling with tears. &quot;Why did he leave?&quot; 

&nbsp;

&quot;Ummm... He left because... why would he stay?&quot; Bill
asked. 

&nbsp;

&quot;He
wouldn't leave me here...&quot; She was starting to cry for real now, tear
pouring down her cheeks. It made Bill uncomfortable. He walked towards her and
put an arm around her shoulder. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Easy
now, easy...&quot; They slowly sank down the wall until they were sitting
against it, Jamie crying into Bill's shoulder. 

&nbsp;

The
drunk guy sitting against the wall muttered
&quot;god...&quot; and stood up. 

&nbsp;

&quot;His
name is Warren,&quot; Bill
informed her in an effort to change the subject. She looked up at him for a
second, just in time to see him grab her by the hands and shove her into the
far wall. He took Bill by the hand and led him out of the room, slamming the door
behind him. She could hear them talking outside the door. 

&nbsp;

&quot;What
the fuck are you doing?&quot; A slurred and angry voice.
Had to be Warren.

&nbsp;

&quot;I
- &quot; 

&nbsp;

�We
bought her to sell her, dumbass, not to cry about her
hubby.�

&nbsp;

�Yes,
but-�

&nbsp;

&quot;We're
going to fucking sell her-&quot; 

&nbsp;

&quot;I
know, but she-&quot; 

&nbsp;

�Shutup, she�s listening.� Their voices lowered to a
whisper. She could still hear everything. �When you go back, you need to act
all confident and shit, like in that movie� damn I
forget� it started with a V��

&nbsp;

�V for Vendetta?�

&nbsp;

�What?
Who would watch that-�

&nbsp;

�Nevermind.�

&nbsp;

�Ok.
Anyway, why do you think she woke up so fast? It was barely 5 minutes�� The
voices lowered even further and she could no longer make out anything they
said.

&nbsp;

But
that didn�t change her predicament. Gary
left me, she told herself. These two nutjobs
wouldn�t hurt her, but� why? Why would he leave her? And in
this bizarre way, too? She had given him� everything. She couldn�t
imagine life without him. Actually, she could, but involved passing out a lot, and
big blank spaces in her memory. She heard some poorly stifled laughter and the
door opened again.

&nbsp;

Bill
and Warren came in, their faces almost comically straight and hostile. They
looked like they were about to crack up at any second. 

&nbsp;

�What
did you do to Gary?� Jamie blurted
out. She didn�t even realize what she said until she heard herself. Of course,
these two had blackmailed Gary into leaving, and
he was now on his way back with the cops, or whatever they had in this country.
The thought made her feel better, and more confident.

&nbsp;

Neither
said a word. They solemnly walked up to her and Bill slapped her in the face.
She turned around and punched him as hard as she could. Both stared at each
other, furious and unhurt. Warren was turning
purple.

&nbsp;

Suddenly
unleashing all the stored alcohol in him, Warren shoved Bill aside and almost
picked Jamie up by the hair. She screamed in real pain this time and tried to
fend off his hand, gasping in pain. Not satisfied yet, Warren put his hand over
her face and pushed her back into the wall, still holding on to her hair. She
could barely breathe behind his hand. He was saying something to Bill but she
couldn�t hear it. Things were becoming black around the edges and her face was
turning blue. Her eyes darted all over the place but she couldn�t see. 

&nbsp;

��and
remember to pay whoever owns this place. I�m going ahead with Jamie,� Warren said to Bill.

&nbsp;

Jamie
must have blacked out for a second, because things were slowly focusing and she
could breathe. She was sitting against the wall, rubbing her head where Warren had almost ripped
her hair out. 

&nbsp;

Bill
nodded and left the room. She looked back at Warren and was amazed.
He was still pretty red in the face, but he was sobering up before her very
eyes. It is a truly once in a lifetime event � watching someone sober up
dramatically in a short amount of time. But she wasn�t in the right mindset to
appreciate it.

&nbsp;

Warren was certainly
feeling better. It had a little to do with his rigid Army Discipline. But much
more to do with the bottle of viagra he was planning
to sell together with Jamie. The two items should naturally be sold together,
he reasoned. Like two beer kegs. You don�t buy one without the other. And in
any case, who�s counting pills? Might as well check to see if they�re� potent. 

&nbsp;

And
they certainly were potent. He was feeling horny, and extremely aggressive. He
always felt aggressive, but today even more so. Looking at Jamie�s skinny body
on the floor made his dick hard, her hair was so� blonde, her body so small and
fragile� but No. He had the Discipline of an Army. And in any case, it wouldn�t
be fair if Bill fucked her first. Bill was a moron. He would never know. Not
that it was wrong, but still. Bill will Never Know. 

&nbsp;

Warren smiled crookedly,
looking down at Jamie. She was looking at him. She wants me� look at the way she�s staring at me he thought. He
was so sexy, he told himself. He was actually doing her a favor by fucking her.
Ohhh� he caught himself in time. No premature
ejaculation for him. Army Discipline. 

&nbsp;

Bending
down, he picked her up and dragged her across to the table. See the way she
yells? She wants me as bad as I want her.
He pushed her onto her back, her legs hanging off the table. She came right
back up like one of those pop up toys or something. He read about them in
books. He just pushed her right down again and began fumbling with her pants. 

&nbsp;

Jamie
was crying now, screaming as loud as she could. For anyone.


&nbsp;

Warren unzipped her
pants and pulled down her tight jeans. Pushing aside her panties, he admired
her smooth little cunt for a second. That�s right, he told himself. Her Cunt. He felt 9 feet tall. Until he discovered that the
table was actually at most 4 feet high, which would make that a physical
impossibility. Oh and speaking of physical impossibilities, you can�t fuck
someone with your pants on. 

&nbsp;

He
blushed for a second, but corrected his mistake quickly. His dick was hard
already, and he admired it too for a second, staring at his Manliness� that�s gay. He pushed the thought from
his mind and was just about to fuck Jamie when Bill burst into the room. 

&nbsp;

�..hnnh� What�s �hnnh�
wrong�� He was puffing loudly, holding his chest. He
stopped talking, his mouth open. Warren stared back at
him, spewing his semen on Jamie�s pubic area. She was sobbing, the fight out of
her. She just wanted him to get it over with now, not realizing that it was.

&nbsp;

�Umm�
Hi,� Warren said, waving
exaggeratedly. �I was� uh��

&nbsp;

�I
know what you were doing,� Bill said angrily.

&nbsp;

�No,
no, it looks like that but really ��

&nbsp;

�You�re
cheating on me,� Bill said and started crying. There was a deafening silence.
Jamie stopped crying and realized she wasn�t going to get raped after all. 

&nbsp;

Warren turned around
now, his dick still hanging out of his pants.

&nbsp;

�You�re�
gay?� he asked. Bill was sobbing now,

&nbsp;

Warren looked at Bill�s
eyes and followed them to his dick. He hastily stuffed it back into his pants.
He then reached into his pocket and pulled out his glock.


&nbsp;

�What
�� Bill managed, before Warren started emptying
his gun into Bill�s body. He didn�t stop until there was a bloody mess on the
floor, and he ran out of bullets. 

&nbsp;

Jamie
slid off the table and stared at what used to be Bill�s body. She bent down and
puked on the floor.
