 Julia&#8217;s Holiday Villa.

1
The Great Lady Julia slept comfortably in her huge silk sheeted bed. Two maids knelt beside her on the floor and her fan was in attendance keeping her cool throughout the summer&#8217;s night. It was 7 o&#8217;clock in the morning, and the Mistress of the house rarely got up long before noon. 

It was therefore a surprise when she stirred from her slumber and sat up. She stretched her perfectly shaped arms and yawned. Without speaking she slipped her gorgeous legs from the bed. Fortunately the maids were completely focused and managed to place her slippers on to save her divine feet from touching the ground.

The senior maid gently took Julia&#8217;s hand to help her up from the bed. This was something she did every day of her life, but the softness of her Mistress&#8217;s skin never failed to send shivers up her spine.

As Julia alighted the bed both girls in attendance knelt and pressed their lips to the floor by her feet. No words were exchanged so the girls were unaware of where they were going when they gowned and followed their owner out of the bed chambers.

Actually all Julia wanted was a little walk to stretch her limbs, so the door slave opened the door with a bow and the mismatched threesome were on their way.

The Palace seemed strange to Julia at such an unGodly hour At first this quite amused her but then she thought she heard noises coming from the day room. She elegantly strode towards the door where another slave opened it for her with a bow.

Stepping onto the veranda she looked down on a dozen or so slaves kneeling and cleaning away at the floor and furniture. She smiled in bemusement, spotting an overseer she snapped her fingers at him, &#8216;you here!&#8217;

The overseer sprinted up the steps to where she stood and bowed, &#8216;my Lady?&#8217;

Julia gave a vague wave of her hand, &#8216;who are these people?&#8217;

&#8216;They-they are just your cleaning slaves Great Lady.&#8217;

&#8216;Hmmm, so they live here?&#8217;

&#8216;Yes my Lady, in the slave quarters.&#8217;

Lady Julia couldn&#8217;t recall buying these slaves. She had never given much thought to how her Palace was cleaned; she just always experienced it in pristine fashion. Actually great efforts were always made for the cleaning to be performed out of sight and earshot of The Mistress of the house.

&#8216;By the Gods!&#8217; she laughed, &#8216;this is worse than finding one has mice.&#8217; She then pouted and declared, &#8216;this sight offends me though. It won&#8217;t happen again.&#8217;

&#8216;No my Lady.&#8217;

&#8216;Have them all flogged when they&#8217;re finished and no food for a couple of days.&#8217;

&#8216;Yes my Lady.&#8217;

&#8216;Oh and select one at random for me to watch their punishment whilst I lunch.&#8217;

Yes Great Lady, er any one in particular my Lady?&#8217;

Julia idly pointed at the first one she clapped eyes on, &#8216;that one, she&#8217;ll do.&#8217;

&#8216;Yes my Lady&#8217; assured her overseer, &#8216;I&#8217;m so sorry about this my Lady.&#8217;

&#8216;You will be if it happens again.&#8217; She stated coldly as she walked back towards her bed chambers.

The overseer surveyed the cleaners who he knew worked themselves into the ground for sixteen hours a day seven days a week. The majority of the Palace was cleaned while The Mistress slept or was out. The bed chambers and less used areas whilst she wouldn&#8217;t be bothered by them. He felt sorry for them that they were to be punished but had his own position to think about. Bounding down the steps he applied his whip here and there hissing &#8216;move yourselves, get this place perfect!&#8217; Already quite fatigued, the slaves pushed themselves even harder.

Back in her chambers Julia stretched out upon her bed quite nude. The two maids knelt with their heads bowed and the fan slave began to waft the oversized ostrich feathered fan. As ever he tried not to focus on the voluptuous body in front of him. It tormented him to the point he dreamt of it every day and woke up in a sweat. Though he spent about ten hours a night standing five yards away he had never touched it and knew if he did it would be the last thing he ever did.

His predecessor had erred in such a manner two years earlier. Julia had just been hosting a banquet and unusually for her had become a little tipsy. As she had approached her bed she had stumbled right in front of the fan. Without thinking he had held out a strong arm and caught her to save her from falling. This of course was sacrilege and a few hours later he was crucified in The Palace courtyard.

He was still there when his replacement, a new purchase was brought in. All the slaves were ordered to view the miscreant as he slowly died on the cross, and the lesson was not wasted on them.

Julia still felt restless so she snapped her fingers at the pretty Ethiopian maid and ordered her onto the bed. Splaying her long shapely legs she ordered the girl, &#8216;tongue me!&#8217; The girl did so instantly, although she was heterosexual the girl felt very honoured to perform such a task.

As she delved her tongue into her Mistress&#8217;s most intimate crevice she reflected how much she loved her. She thought how kind her Mistress was and how she had only had her whipped four times in the last year. Each time she accepted she had thoroughly deserved it, in fact the last time she had coughed during the night and woken her owner. And so she tongued for all she was worth, to please her Mistress was the only aspect of life which mattered.

As Julia began to sigh sexily the fan tried harder not to think about what was occurring in front of him. He simply fanned, and fanned, and fanned.

Presently Julia climaxed with a long low grunt and kicked the girl off of the bed. She then lay with a delicious smile on her seductive lips as she slipped into a well deserved slumber.

2
The cleaning slave chosen for her owner&#8217;s lunchtime entertainment sat waiting in a tiny cell. It was now past noon and her weak understanding of Latin had left her bewildered as to what was going on. She had heard the other slaves being flogged before being sent to bed but she was now alone.

She had been in the house of Julia for two years since being captured in a raid on Gaul. Her name was Fabia but as time went by and no-one used it she had more or less forgotten it. She put her heart and soul into the harsh labours expected of her and never complained. Aside from the odd clip of an overseer&#8217;s whip she had never been truly flogged, there had never been any necessity.

Now she was so very frightened, she didn&#8217;t know what the cleaning slaves had done wrong and she had no idea why she was being singled out.

Presently a couple of overseers came to her cell, dragged her out and hosed her down with cold water. She was roughly dried, attired in slave tunic and escorted to the Palace&#8217;s day room.

Here she was alarmed at the amount of people occupying the room. There were half a dozen musicians, four fan slaves, eight serving slaves, three guards, three maids and two overseers. Then there were two Ladies so elegant and beautiful she thought she was dreaming. Never had she imagined such refined Ladies existed, she guessed one of them must be her owner.

The two Ladies were sitting upright on velvet couches trimmed with gold, The couches were designed so one could sit up comfortably or recline. Fabia was brought before the gorgeous blonde and brought to her knees. Instinctively she bowed her head to within a couple of inches of the gold spun slippers which adorned the delectable feet of her owner.

Her owner, The Great Lady Julia spoke down to her in her customary soft voice; &#8216;do you know why you are here girl?&#8217;

Fabia didn&#8217;t even understand what was being said to her so replied, &#8216;Mistress??&#8217;

Julia placed her foot on the girl&#8217;s neck and squashed her face into the floor; &#8216;I asked you a question slave, now answer me!&#8217;

Frightened, the girl sobbed in Gallic; &#8216;I beg pardon Mistress, I don&#8217;t understand.&#8217;

Fortunately for Fabia, Julia&#8217;s guest and friend Lucillia understood a deal of Gallic and interjected, &#8216;my dear, the little bitch cannot speak Latin.&#8217;

Julia eased her foot off a little and asked her raven haired friend to explain the girl&#8217;s crime. She did so telling the girl, &#8216;your Mistress doesn&#8217;t expect to have to cast her eyes on the likes of you working.&#8217;

Fabia attempted in broken Latin, &#8216;Please Mistress, I am so sorry, please forgive me.&#8217;

&#8216;I shall forgive you this time slave,&#8217; informed her Mistress. &#8216;However you shall still be punished,&#8217; with this she snapped her fingers at an overseer who rushed forward to take hold of the girl and drag her to the whipping frame.

Once she was stripped and secured, her wrists fastened above her head, Fabia was left hanging there whilst the Ladies enjoyed their luncheon. Lucillia remained sitting upright but once her maid had deftly removed her slippers Julia reclined along the length of her couch. Kneeling before her was a serving slave who held up a golden platter of fine meats, oysters, snails, salad and bread.

Julia ate sparingly, picking at pieces of partridge or pork. After each mouthful a maid was on hand to gently wipe her dainty fingers with a damp cloth. She would then take a small mouthful of wine from a bejewelled goblet held on another tray by yet another slave. Each of these slaves had been chosen for their diminutive frames and trained to be exceedingly unobtrusive. Lucillia had a similar retinue around her but chose to hold her goblet allowing a larger, standing slave to refill it for her occasionally.

Behind each Lady were two Nubians who kept them cool with oversized feather fans. Those behind Julia were experienced and could usually pick up on her body language to gauge increase or decrease in the strength of their labour. The two behind Lucillia did not know her so well so had to rely on little hand gestures from her. It wasn&#8217;t considered etiquette to actually speak to slaves of their level.

Just prior to lunch being served the Ladies had been discussing a financial situation Lucillia had found herself in. Following a complicated business transaction a semi retired merchant, Pelagius, had found himself unable to pay her a large debt.

&#8216;So how much does he owe you darling?&#8217; asked a concerned Julia.

&#8216;A hundred thousand sestersii.&#8217;

&#8216;Gosh, that&#8217;s rather a lot,&#8217; commented Julia taking a sip of her wine. Fortunately though young Lucillia was from an extremely wealthy family and such a sum wouldn&#8217;t make or break her.

Julia, who was much wealthier asked, &#8216;where does he live?&#8217;

&#8216;Torvaianica.&#8217;

&#8216;Oh it&#8217;s lovely there,&#8217; smiled her hostess somewhat off-topic. Torvaianica was in fact a small seaside town about five miles outside of Rome; Julia had often visited it due to her love of the sea, the sand and the sun. &#8216;I say, don&#8217;t go to the magistrate just yet, I have an idea. Give it until the end of the week.&#8217;

&#8216;If you say so Julia,&#8217; replied a bemused Lucillia dismissing her food bearer with a languid wave of her hand.

Julia&#8217;s sharp mind had already formulated a plan and if it brought her favour from the beautiful young Lucillia then all the better. For now she decided to provide a little entertainment, she dismissed her own food bearer and told the chief overseer to begin the flogging of the cleaning slave.

Though she braced herself, nothing could prepare Fabia for the pain of the first stroke of the leather bullwhip. It was as if someone had set fire to her back and she cried out. Julia pouted a little as she preferred more of a challenge; Lucillia took a sip of her wine.

In order to provide the Ladies with optimum amusement the overseer paused between each lash of the whip. The second landed across the slave&#8217;s back just above the first, causing another &#8216;yelp&#8217;. But after the first half a dozen she was down to grunting, in fact she tried to grit her teeth against the blows.

&#8216;That&#8217;s more like it.&#8217; Julia murmured to her friend. For some slaves a mouth shield would have been used to protect their mouths and tongues from biting. However the appearance of a skivvy was of no importance, nor would it matter if she bit her tongue right off. After all it wouldn&#8217;t prevent her from cleaning.

As the whipping continued the Ladies took less notice of it and chatted generally. Julia had become increasingly attracted to Lucillia and secretly hoped the favour she was going to attempt would bring them closer. At 24 the black haired, brown eyed Lady was becoming more beautiful each day. &#8216;Are you ready for something sweet?&#8217; Julia asked.

&#8216;Yes please,&#8217; answered Lucillia.

With which Julia snapped her fingers at the food servers without taking her eyes from her guest. Within seconds dishes of moussed, sugared lemon topped with whipped cream and garnished with cherries were served. Lucillia allowed a maid to remove her laced sandals before reclining on her couch in the same manner as Julia.

Each Lady dismissed their respective servers and positioned their plates on their couches. Fabia was sobbing uncontrollably now and Julia ordered the overseer, &#8216;make her sing!&#8217; tuning again to her guest she commented, &#8216;he&#8217;s good at this you&#8217;ll see.&#8217;

The overseer picked up his longest whip and stepped to the side of the unfortunate girl shackled before him. Swinging the whip back he let go with a thunderous lash which wrapped around her body burning her agonisingly. Uncontrollably a shrill scream rose from Fabia&#8217;s stomach, up through to her throat and into the air. Both Ladies chuckled at the noise, and smiling, Julia nodded to the overseer to continue in this fashion.

He did so producing all sorts of weird and wonderful noises. Julia dipped her elegant little finger into the cream on her cake and brought it to her delectable mouth. It was sweet and tasty causing a little fission within her and a smile to her lovely lips.

She contemplating ordering the girl to stop making any noise but decided that would be cruel. And she certainly didn&#8217;t consider herself cruel.

The Ladies enjoyed their sweets as the lashing continued. Having lost all control now Fabia was urinating down her leg and onto the floor. Julia laughed and informed Lucillia, &#8216;&#8217;good job there&#8217;s no rug there otherwise I&#8217;d have had her punished.&#8217;

This quip made Lucillia laugh out loud which in turn made Julia feel moist between her legs.

Presently the serving slaves removed the plates and hands were wiped before more wine was poured. Fabia was now unconscious, thoroughly whipped and beaten. Of course the overseer did not stop until Julia raised her hand at him Imperiously.

Doused with water the girl regained her senses and was released from the whipping frame. She was made to crawl to her owner&#8217;s couch where she grovelled whimpering out loud. &#8216;Silence!!&#8217; ordered Julia. Understanding this Fabia somehow managed to quieten down.

Julia looked down her regal nose at the girl and smiled, &#8216;that should teach the little slut,&#8217; she said to Lucillia.

 The entertainment over, the girl was dismissed and half dragged to the slave quarters. Julia beckoned her chief housekeeper over with a curl of her index finger. He was a free man but still acted with great respect before his employer. &#8216;My Lady?&#8217; he asked.

&#8216;Linus. That overseer is very good; when the girl has been cleaned up allow him to pleasure himself with her.&#8217;

&#8216;Yes my Lady.&#8217;

Behind her hand Julia whispered to him, &#8216;and before she leaves ensure you get a good look at Lady Lucillia.&#8217;

Linus bowed his head and withdrew. In his position he could glance at his employer and her guests but was always supposed to keep a slightly bowed head whilst doing so. Ordinarily a slave would look at the feet of an aristocrat when being spoken to. He didn&#8217;t know yet why he was to look at Lucillia but knew he must obey this order.

The Ladies carried on chatting about the latest gossip in Rome until it was time for Lucillia to leave. The maid quickly but carefully laced up her sandals and aided her to her feet.

Rather than escort her to her waiting litter, Julia stood and said her goodbyes indoors. The Nobles kissed, though Julia lingered with hers slightly longer than a friendly embrace. Lucillia didn&#8217;t seem to notice and glided off in the direction of her litter.

When she had departed Linus returned to Julia who asked him, &#8216;did you get a good look at her?&#8217;

&#8216;Yes my Lady,&#8217; answered the housekeeper who had been quite taken aback by her beauty.

&#8216;Good. Tomorrow I am going to Torvaianica; while I am gone you are to go to the slave market. Buy me the two slaves who most resemble The Lady Lucillia.&#8217;

&#8216;Yes my Lady,&#8217; replied Linus who wondered how he was going to find such rare beauty amongst slaves.

&#8216;For now, have them prepare Thomassio for me.&#8217;

Linus bowed and withdrew. Thomassio was Julia&#8217;s favorite pleasure slave. Young, handsome and very well endowed he was also deaf and blind. These disabilities allowed his owner to really let any inhibitions disappear. By which, she didn&#8217;t really like a slave to realize how much pleasure it was giving her. In fact Thomassio had been purposely blinded on her order after he had been purchased.


3
The following day Julia awoke just before noon. The events of yesterday ran through her mind. How beautiful Lucillia had looked, how much she wanted to have her. And the opportunity to please her by sorting out this financial affair. She also thought of the time she&#8217;d spent with her pleasure slave. She&#8217;d expected it to be exceptional with her juices already flowing and with thoughts of Lucillia running through her mind.

However it was simply not what she had required at that time. It was the soft curves and gentleness of her friend, not the potent strength of Thomassio she yearned for. Although he had performed as well as usual she had had him flogged. Whether he would ever understand why, was of no concern, though he wouldn&#8217;t be in any fit state to return to the pleasure room for a week or so.

Still, thought Julia, at least Linus should be fetching me a Lucillia lookalike today, and come Friday the real thing will be here again and who knows? 

So it was with a smile on her lovely face that Julia arose from her bed before being bathed, massaged and dressed for her journey. She reclined comfortably in her huge litter
borne by sixteen muscular slaves. Fortunately for them the journey was relatively short as the sun was beating down with all its summer venom. This was of no concern to Julia who was sheltered by silk curtains and sipped cooled pomegranate juice.

As she set out, last minute preparations were taking place at the villa of Pelagius. A messenger from Lady Julia had been sent to inform Pelagius of his Mistress&#8217;s impending visit.
.
This was indeed an honour, a visit from the Great and Noble Lady Julia. The villa was considerably smaller than the residence of Lady Julia with only a dozen slaves to maintain it. However it was a very smart little property, well furnished and kept meticulously clean. Pelagius lived there with his young wife Valeria.

He had been a successful merchant, trading mainly jewellery but occasionally grain. Being a self made man he had worked hard and neglected a social or love life. Then three years ago, at the age of forty he met Valeria who was eighteen at the time. She was from a lower middle class background but was very beautiful. Golden blonde hair crowned a delectable face. She had a slim but curvaceous body which could make any man tremble.

The inevitable happened and Pelagius fell in love, the two were married three months later. However, Valeria made impossible demands on her husband&#8217;s wealth. At first he bought her anything she wanted and paid for exotic vacations. Later when he questioned her wishes she would pout and refuse to let him anywhere near her. The pout itself was enough to have him begging her to let him buy what she had asked for and soon his money began to drain away.

His business deals became more hazardous as he tried to keep her &#8216;love&#8217; and he was now in debt to the tune of half a million sestertii. He hoped the visit of one as wealthy as Lady Julia might signal an upturn in his fortunes.

As the household slaves prepared for the visit Valeria lay on a couch watching them. Her marriage was becoming a great disappointment to her as the gifts from her husband dried up. For some time she had carried out a clandestine affair with her young masseur, Cleta. She now openly flaunted this relationship, using this boy as her personal slave. It was only because her husband still loved her so that he put up with this. Roman law very much favoured the husband, but passionate love made a fool of the law.

As Cleta poured her wine Valeria openly fondled his thigh. Though she treated him like the slave he was, the boy didn&#8217;t care. He loved her with a passion and couldn&#8217;t believe his master had not killed him or at least sold him. In fact he couldn&#8217;t afford to kill him and if he sold him Valeria would leave him. If only he could find a return in financial fortune, the rest would fall into place.

The villa was now in pristine condition and Pelagius sent the slaves to scrub themselves clean. Alone with his wife he went and knelt by her couch. &#8216;Please my dear,&#8217; he almost begged, &#8216;please help me today. Perhaps things could go back to before.&#8217;

Valeria looked him coldly in the eye and asked, &#8216;so who&#8217;s this bitch Julia?&#8217;

Pelagius looked pained, &#8216;please Valeria she&#8217;s not a bitch. She is one of the most respected women in Rome. She is one of the most beautiful; she is one of the Noblest. She is one of the richest.&#8217;

The richest part perked Valeria up. She&#8217;d been wondering what to do for a while. She could ensnare another rich man, but divorce was hard on women in Rome. And could she have such freedom with anyone else? Gently stroking his nose with her index finger she declared, &#8216;very well my husband, I shall be on my best behaviour.&#8217;

Pelagius took her hand and began laying kisses on it, &#8216;thank you my darling.&#8217;

Abruptly she withdrew her hand from his grasp, &#8216;when she arrives!&#8217;

4
The procession carrying Julia were now within a mile from Pelagius&#8217;s villa. The area they were now in was quite rural and they passed several slaves cultivating the land. As they saw her great litter they each knelt and pressed their faces to the mud in respect. They didn&#8217;t actually know who was in the litter but they recognised power and it was if they were grovelling to Rome herself.

With her curtains closed, Julia never saw the slaves grovelling before her. It wouldn&#8217;t have made any impression on her anyway as she was completely over exposed to seeing slaves grovel before her.
She had come to the stage that she no longer gave orders. When one gave an order one waited for it to be carried out. If she wanted something done she would simply say it as if she were thinking out loud. She was surrounded by constant and utter obedience.

Her slaves were sweating up now as the sun beat down on them. One, Decimus, was having a particularly hard time of it. He had cracked a collar bone a week earlier and the weight of the litter runner vibrating on it was very painful. He hadn&#8217;t mentioned it, who would care? Also his mind had been conditioned to accept that his pain was irrelevant. The only thing of importance was ensuring his Mistress travelled smoothly from a to b.

Each of the litter slaves were of the same mind. In the stable where they were housed stood a statue of the Great Lady Julia. The first thing every morning and last thing every night, they would each kneel before the statue and kiss it&#8217;s feet. They had all been broken by overseers on purchase and now truly worshipped their divine owner. If one of them stumbled on a journey he earned the wrath of the others for days. Their entire reason for living was to give neat transit to their owner.

5
Julia&#8217;s arrival at the villa was met with ceremony. She stepped out of her litter onto the back of the little slave who lay prostrate before her. Immediately two slaves held a parasol over her head but she still shielded her delicate eyes from the sun.

She noticed the villa was quite small, but also that it was beautifully built and very clean. As she entered Valeria greeted her with a little bow and Pelagius showed her to the finest couch available. A house slave fanned her as she sat and another served her fine wine. The slave Cleta offered her sweetmeats from a silver tray.

Julia sipped at her wine and tasted the treats while Pelagius and Valeria stood nervously. In time Pelagius spoke, &#8216;thank You for honouring our house with your presence Great Lady&#8217;.

It was the kind of welcoming speech Julia was used to and frankly bored of. She was though, a most generous Lady and waving her hand at Pelagius stated, &#8216;you may sit.&#8217;

Both he and his wife gratefully went to take up this offer in their own home, but Valeria was stopped by Julia&#8217;s words, &#8216;no you may take off my sandals&#8217;.

Awkwardly the girl obeyed. Her upbringing had meant that at times she had dressed herself, but never did she envisage removing the shoes of another woman. However, if this was what it took to return to a life of wealth then so be it.

As she loosened the laces from the shapely legs of her guest she realized nearly all of her slaves were here to witness this. As she knelt at the feet of Lady Julia she felt like a slave herself. However she swallowed her resentment and shame and silently vowed to have all the slaves whipped when their guest was gone, including Cleta.
As vexed as she was, Valeria couldn&#8217;t help to notice how lovely Julia&#8217;s feet were as she eased off her sandals. Soft and flawless with her toenails pedicured and painted a glossy red, they were truly beautiful. So beautiful, Valeria slipped into a little trance and didn&#8217;t really hear the conversation above her.

Julia and Pelagius were discussing the villa and its location, &#8216;so close to the sea,&#8217; remarked the guest, &#8216;I used to love holidaying around here.&#8217;

&#8216;Well great Lady, you are more than welcome to come and stay here at any time,&#8217; offered Pelagius, ignoring the fact his wife was grovelling at her feet.

Julia smiled to herself and asked, &#8216;do you have a swimming pool/&#8217;

&#8216;Oh yes Lady Julia, it&#8217;s just outside, would you care to see it?&#8217;

&#8216;Yes,&#8217; declared the lovely blonde who instinctively clicked her fingers and gestured to Valeria to put her sandals back on. As quickly as she could she replaced them and laced them up once more.

Without bothering to acknowledge her, Julia gracefully stood up and walked with Pelagius to the pool area. As soon as she stepped into the sunlight she snapped her fingers and pointed upwards. Within an instant a slave held a parasol over her head to shield her from the sun. She smiled showing off her perfect white teeth and commented, &#8216;what a splendid pool.&#8217; And indeed it was, marble with statuettes all around.

She re-entered the villa and sat down again, allowing Valeria to take off her sandals again before reclining. She spoke candidly to Pelagius, &#8216;I understand you owe quite a large amount of money in Rome.&#8217;

Her host looked embarrassed but admitted, &#8216;yes Great Lady., but I�&#8217;

Julia held up her hand to silence him, &#8216;something in the region of half a million sestersii?&#8217;

Pelagius bowed his head and admitted, &#8216;yes Lady.&#8217;

&#8216;In the main, this is to friends of mine, I certainly know them all anyway,&#8217; she sipped her wine and allowed Cleta to replenish her chalice. &#8216;I have decided to pay off all of these debts.&#8217;

Pelagius felt his mouth open, this could be better than I had hoped, he thought.

&#8216;And I shall have this place!&#8217;

Had a pin dropped at this moment, all would have heard it. Pelagius looked stunned, &#8216;but Great Lady, this place is worth three times what I owe.&#8217;

Julia smiled smugly, &#8216;I am The Great Lady Julia of Rome. This place is worth what I say it is!&#8217;

Pelagius walked over to her defensively and knelt before her, &#8216;but please Lady, we would have nowhere to live, nowhere to go.&#8217;

Julia spoke down to him calmly, &#8216;I presume you know of my influence amongst the Senate?&#8217; he nodded with tears in his eyes before she carried on, &#8216;well you must realise I could have you enslaved for having such debts. One word from me and you&#8217;d spend the rest of your miserable existence sweating away in my copper mine. Do you understand?&#8217;

&#8216;Yes Lady,&#8217; he sobbed.

&#8216;I want you out of here before Saturday. You may take the three older slaves to sell. I&#8217;ll keep the rest. Actually,&#8217; she gestured towards Cleta, &#8216;I&#8217;ll take this one with me.&#8217;

He was crying at her feet, as was Valeria.

&#8216;Now. Kiss my shoes, offer me what I demand and thank me for my lenience.&#8217;

Broken now, Pelagius kissed the sandals on the floor and promised, &#8216;please take my home Lady Julia, th-thank you for being so generous.&#8217;

Julia smiled cruelly, &#8216;you too you little slut!&#8217;

Valeria kissed the sandals and cried, &#8216;thank you for being so kind Great Lady.&#8217;

Julia allowed them to replace a sandal each before standing, &#8216;I shall have people round on Friday to sign everything up, be prepared to leave then.&#8217; As she walked to the door she concluded, &#8216;Oh and you can throw away the furniture and dishes, I&#8217;ll buy some decent stuff!&#8217; And with that she was gone.

6
Julia quite enjoyed the trip home. Half a million sestersii was a trifle to her and she had managed to solve Lucillia&#8217;s issue and snapped up a delightful holiday home into the bargain.

So it was a smiling Mistress who entered her home at around Five o&#8217;clock. Linus greeted her with a bow. &#8216;Did you purchase the slave girls?&#8217; she enquired.

&#8216;Yes my Lady, they are in the day room.&#8217;

Julia walked into the room to see two tall black haired girls standing there. &#8216;As she walked over to them she commanded, &#8216;disrobe!&#8217; They at once complied showing slim but curved figures.

Julia approached the first girl and took her face in her hand. Looking at her she curled her delectable top lip in a look of disappointment. Moving to the next girl, she lifted her chin with one finger. Immediately her face broke into a huge smile, &#8216;oh Linus you&#8217;ve done very well here!&#8217;

Linus gave a sigh of relief and smiled himself. The girl did indeed have a look very similar to Lucillia. Not as cultured, not as assured, but a similar look about her all the same. &#8216;I want her bathed, perfumed, made up and dressed in something fine. Then put her in my bed chambers&#8217;.

&#8216;Yes my Lady,&#8217; agreed a happy Linus, &#8216;er, and the other one my Lady?&#8217;

Julia&#8217;s lip curled once more, &#8216;oh, put her to work in the kitchens. I don&#8217;t wish to see her again.&#8217;

Later that evening Julia entered her boudoir where the new girl stood nervously by her bed. She dismissed the maids but clicked her fingers at the fan to start operating. She reclined on the bed with a golden goblet of wine and looked at the girl, &#8216;what is your name slave?&#8217;

Shyly the girl answered, &#8216;Nanu Mistress.&#8217;

Julia realised she was Egyptian. Gently stroking her leg with her foot she informed her, &#8216;no, from now on your name is Lucillia, do you understand?&#8217;

The girl nodded and said,&#8217; yes Mistress&#8217;

&#8216;That&#8217;s a lovely dress you&#8217;re wearing Lucillia.&#8217;

&#8216;Yes Mistress, Thank you Mistress&#8217;

&#8216;Take it off.&#8217;

The girl did as she was told.

&#8216;Now come and lie with me Lucillia.&#8217;

Again, though nervous the girl obeyed. Her Mistress ran her palm down her back and noticed some old weals on the flesh. &#8216;How long since you were last whipped girl?&#8217;

&#8216;Three weeks Mistress.&#8217;

&#8216;Well, if you please me as much as I think you shall, there&#8217;s really no need for you to ever be whipped again.&#8217;

The girl smiled, showing perfect teeth, &#8216;thank You Mistress.&#8217;

&#8216;And you may call me Julia.&#8217;

&#8216;Thank you Julia.&#8217;

As hard as he tried to ignore the conversation, the fan slave was shocked. Never had he heard his Mistress talk to a slave in such a friendly manner. And to allow her to call her Julia! However, he managed to keep his face impassive, and fanned and fanned and fanned.

Julia was running her bejewelled fingers through the girl&#8217;s long dark hair. Accidentally she snagged it causing the girl to wince slightly, &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry Lucillia,&#8217; she whispered. It was the first time she had ever apologised to a slave in her life. But of course she was imagining that the girl wasn&#8217;t a slave but her lovely friend Lucillia.

She slipped off her own gown now, revealing to &#8216;Lucillia&#8217; one of the most breathtaking sights the world had to offer. &#8216;Do you like my body Lucillia?&#8217; she asked, almost coyly.

The girl was still nervous, she was also heterosexual but answered truthfully, &#8216;yes Julia, it is beautiful.&#8217;

Smiling Julia husked, &#8216;and so are you.&#8217; Then she kissed her softly on the mouth. It was the first time she had ever kissed a slave, and she liked it. &#8216;Lucillia&#8217; responded and in no time they were kissing passionately and caressing each other&#8217;s luscious bodies.

The fan forced himself to look away. It was the only way he could retain his sanity. He simply fanned and fanned and fanned.

On instruction, &#8216;Lucillia&#8217; now licked and sucked at Julia&#8217;s perfect nipples. Julia didn&#8217;t really want to instruct as it tainted the fantasy a little, but the girl&#8217;s wonderful tongue compensated nicely.

Before long &#8216;Lucillia&#8217; was kneeling between Julia&#8217;s long firm legs lapping away at her womanhood. It felt strange licking away at a vagina, but it certainly beat being roughly handled by a Master. She had cursed her own beauty in the past as it had reduced her to the role of plaything for both her previous Masters and their friends. It had also caused jealousy from her last Mistress, hence her sale. She had never desired women, but if this was the price she had to pay for a comfortable life then so be it.

She was now lapping away like an expert, long hard strokes of her tongue against her Mistress&#8217;s labia and clitoris. Julia lay back amongst her pillows and cried out in pleasure. At last she had her own &#8216;Lucillia&#8217; and what a performer she was. As she climaxed violently she shouted the name, &#8216;Lucillia! Lucillia!! Lucill-ia!!!&#8217;

Then they lay a while, the beautiful relaxed blonde cuddling her raven haired lover. After they kissed a little the whole delicious drama began again. This time, Julia allowed her mind to wander to help her stimulation. She thought of Pelagius and his wife and what would become of them. It was almost certain the wife would spiral towards prostitution and Julia briefly fantasized about her servicing drunken commoners. This made her laugh cruelly and enjoy her second orgasm even more than the first.

The third was so good she couldn&#8217;t hold back any more. She hadn&#8217;t intended to but she wound up going down on the girl, lashing her aristocratic tongue against the chattel&#8217;s clitoris. If anyone had suggested to her two hours earlier that she would be tonguing a slave they would doubtless have been nailed to a cross. But here she was, loving it.

&#8216;Lucillia&#8217; was liking it a whole lot more than she had expected too. Here was a Noblewoman, someone who could buy or sell her like a donkey or a sack of grain, licking her vulva for all she was worth. No man had ever given any consideration for her pleasure, but Julia was. When she came she gave a shrill cry, and moaned, &#8216;thank you Julia, thank you Julia.&#8217;

And the fan fanned, and fanned and fanned.

8
The next morning Julia awoke and without opening her eyes snapped her fingers and opened her hand expecting a goblet of spring water to be placed into it. When it wasn&#8217;t she opened her eyes in surprise and remembered the night before. Lying next to her was the new slave sleeping soundly. She gave the girl a slap on the bum which awoke her at once. &#8216;Go and fetch me water!&#8217; she ordered. &#8216;Lucillia&#8217; jumped out of bed and ran to obey. She found a maid who gave her a goblet of fresh water and she hurried back to her Mistress. Here she passed the cup and watched as her Mistress drank the content before handing it back.

&#8216;Thank You Julia,&#8217; she said quietly, unsure of how she now stood. Julia looked at the girl in shock but then calmed quickly. She smiled but said, &#8216;no, you will call me Mistress for now.&#8217;

The girl bowed her head and whispered, &#8216;yes Mistress.&#8217;

Feeling good, Julia ordered her in a pleasant tone, &#8216;come onto the bed, you may massage my feet.&#8217;

The girl obeyed and spent twenty minutes rubbing the gorgeous feet of her owner. When she had had enough Julia told the girl to fetch her maids. 

When she was ready Julia got up and went off to be bathed and dressed. Presently Linus came for the girl and took her to what was to be her room. It was small, but beautifully decorated; the girl fell in love with it instantly. Linus informed her, &#8216;you are to stay here at all times unless your Mistress sends for you. I myself will come and take you for a walk in the sunshine everyday. You are a very fortunate girl.&#8217;

&#8216;Yes sir,&#8217; she replied humbly to the man who had bought her yesterday.

As Julia lay supine on her massage table she thought of the girl. She had been fantastic, but ultimately she was still a slave. &#8216;But tomorrow,&#8217; she thought, &#8216;I have the real thing coming to see me.&#8217;

Julia sighed to herself as she thought of the real Lucillia and decided to refrain from sex until her visit.

9
No trouble was spared for Lucillia&#8217;s visit the next day. As she took the short walk from her litter to the Palace door, rows of slaves knelt and bowed their faces into the ground as she passed them. Inside Julia hugged her as if the two hadn&#8217;t met for months.

Servants made them both comfortable by removing their shoes and they relaxed on the two main couches. As Lucillia sipped her wine Julia clicked her fingers at Linus who appeared with a small silk sack.

He presented it to Lucillia with a bow, &#8216;what&#8217;s this?&#8217; she asked Julia.

&#8216;Open it my darling.&#8217;

She did so to find two hundred thousand serstersii in shiny coin. She smiled, &#8216;but Julia?&#8217;

Julia smiled too, saying, &#8216;it&#8217;s the debt from Pelagius, with interest.&#8217;

&#8216;But a hundred per cent?&#8217;

&#8216;Its no more than you deserve my dear.&#8217;&nbsp; Actually Julia had sent her accountant to pay off the other debts yesterday. Each had been happy to settle for seventy five per cent of what they were owed to quash the debts. This left a hundred thousand for her to add on to Lucillia&#8217;s share.

Julia left this out of her explanation but she made no secret of the fact she had obtained a nice little holiday villa. &#8216;Yes I shall be sending some slaves over to decorate it and remain there.&#8217;

&#8216;So is it empty now?&#8217;

&#8216;No, I&#8217;ve left a couple of guards there, and a few of the Villa slaves.&#8217;

&#8216;Oh Julia,&#8217; laughed Lucillia, &#8216;you took his slaves as well?&#8217;

&#8216;Most of them. I brought one back actually, in fact I thought his branding may provide us with a little amusement, he&#8217;s rather pretty.&#8217;

Julia had already had Cleta&#8217;s original branding burnt out, but he had made such a song and dance over it she had decided to save the new marking for a little light entertainment. &#8216;Linus!&#8217; she called, &#8216;we&#8217;ll have the new slave dealt with now.&#8217;

Within a few minutes everything was set. A set of stocks, a brazier, branding iron and an overseer. Lucillia looked a trifle bored until Cleta was brought into the room. &#8216;By the Gods, he is pretty,&#8217; she exclaimed.

Julia smiled, although she didn&#8217;t want any of Lucillia&#8217;s affections being deflected from herself. Still, how could one be jealous of a slave, a piece of property, an animal.

Cleta was shaking with fear as he was brought into place. He was only nineteen and had never experienced a proper flogging. He had been branded as a boy by Pelagius but the memory had faded. The pain he had felt yesterday was the worst he had known. He&#8217;d gone from being the almost pampered plaything of his former Mistress to a real slave overnight. He feared what his future might bring, but most of all he feared the branding which was due to occur.

He was shackled by his wrists, which showed off his lean torso to best effect. The only clothing he wore was a loin cloth which the overseer crudely ripped from him. Lucillia giggled as she saw he was well endowed particularly in relation to his body size.

When Julia gave a cool nod the overseer pressed the burning metal to the slave&#8217;s flesh. He shrieked in agony and began dancing about in his shackles. Both Ladies laughed and Lucillia remarked, &#8216;they make such a fuss over this don&#8217;t they?&#8217;

&#8216;Mmmm, fun to watch though.&#8217;

Cleta was now shaking in pain; Lucillia turned her lovely face to Julia and asked, &#8216;can I touch him?&#8217;

Julia felt a pang of jealousy, but replied, &#8216;of course you can my darling.&#8217;

Lucillia stood and sexily walked over to the still chained slave. She smiled at him and seductively stroked his chest. Though still in pain, he couldn&#8217;t help but be mesmerised by the beauty of this young woman.

&#8216;What a fuss you made,&#8217; she taunted, &#8216;you know you must undergo a little pain for the honour of serving your Mistress and I?

&#8216;Yes Lady, I-I&#8217;m sorry.&#8217;

Lucillia gave a superior smile and touched her fingers to his face. She was wondering what her friend would say if she asked to borrow this slave, or even buy him. Then a terrible thing happened, a tiny ember spat out of the brazier and landed on her foot. &#8216;By The Gods!!&#8217; she cried. All hell broke loose with slaves running for cold water and bandages.

She sat back down and allowed a maid to gently sponge her foot. When she actually looked there was hardly a mark at all, a slight discolouring smaller than a splinter. However, slaves still panicked in their efforts to ease any pain and Julia went to her and held her hand in sympathy.

Soon enough Lucillia realised she wasn&#8217;t hurt at all, however Julia decided on a redress of balance. &#8216;Give him a second branding!&#8217; she ordered.

&#8216;Why not make him beg for it,&#8217; offered her friend.

Julia smiled cruelly, &#8216;yes. Slave, beg us both for another branding!&#8217;

Confused and in dismay, Cleta found himself begging his new owner and her friend for something he dreaded, &#8216;please Mistress, please great Ladies, I beg you, please brand me again.&#8217;

Both Ladies smiled at the irony of the situation, &#8216;very well,&#8217; Julia lifted her little finger towards the overseer, &#8216;brand him!&#8217;

Once more the overseer pressed the red hot metal to the flesh on the boy&#8217;s back. Once more he squealed and screamed. Once more the Ladies laughed gaily.

When he was unchained Lucillia, confident now, called to him crawl over he to me slave. Despite another pang of jealousy, Julia had no issue with her friend treating her property as her own.

Cleta crawled towards the raven haired beauty; as a matter of fact it would have been difficult for him to walk. Lucillia was sitting up now and the boy was at her feet, &#8216;do you see the burn on my foot slave. With great difficulty he managed to see the tiniest of marks on the elegant foot before him.

&#8216;Yes Great Lady,&#8217; he whispered.

&#8216;You may kiss it better.&#8217;

Bowing down he gently kissed the top of her foot. How glad he was to do so, it was truly beautiful, as was she.

She began toying with his face with her foot before bringing his chin up so their eyes met. She looked down her nose at him, a mere slave. She smiled and then spat full in his face, &#8216;lick it up!&#8217; she commanded.
Gratefully he licked and swallowed at the spittle, appreciating it came from one so Noble and lovely. Having had her fun, Lucillia kicked him away and he was taken back to the slave quarters.

&#8216;I&#8217;d like to borrow him sometime,&#8217; Lucillia told Julia when he was gone.

Coughing slightly Julia answered, &#8216;of course my darling.&#8217;

She quickly changed the subject and asked her guest if she would like to try out her new Villa once it was decorated and furnished.

&#8216;Mmm, that would be lovely.&#8217;

&#8216;Oh, and speaking of furniture, I-I wanted to show you my new bed sheets in my chamber.&#8217;

Lucillia looked puzzled; her hostess owned so much finery it seemed unusual for her to show off something as basic as bed sheets. However she shrugged and replied, &#8216;of course my dear.&#8217;

The two began to walk towards the boudoir. As was customary two maids and a fan followed them but Julia dismissed the girls with a wave of her hand.

Inside the chamber Julia invited her friend to sit on the bed to feel the golden silk sheets as the fan took his position to cool them. 

&#8216;Yes they&#8217;re very soft and pretty,&#8217; offered Lucillia stroking the sheets. In truth she wanted to turn the conversation back to the lending of the slave boy but Julia took her by surprise.

Gently stroking the younger Lady&#8217;s face she remarked seductively, &#8216;not near as soft as your skin or as pretty as you.&#8217;

Lucillia was feeling uncomfortable now and made to stand up. However Julia eased her back down and lent over and kissed her gently on the lips. &#8216;It was a pleasure to help you out with that money,&#8217; she husked, kissing her again, &#8216;and as for that slave boy, why not have him as a little gift from me.&#8217;

Lucillia smiled her gratitude but Julia took this the wrong way and began to kiss her more passionately. The young beauty pulled away and gently informed her benefactor, &#8216;I like you very much Julia, but I&#8217;m just not that way inclined.&#8217;

Julia was slightly taken aback but continued in a low voice, &#8216;surely you&#8217;d like to please me though, beautiful darling girl.&#8217;

Not waiting for an answer she kissed her again, hard and without shame. Lucillia broke the embrace and succeeded in standing up. &#8216;No Julia, this is not going to happen!&#8217;

Julia began to caress her thigh and asked, &#8216;please Lucillia, for me?&#8217;

&#8216;No Julia!&#8217; she insisted and made to walk away.

Julia became desperate now and in leaning towards the object of her affections found herself on her knees. &#8216;Please Lucillia,&#8217; she begged, &#8216;I want you, I need you!&#8217;

&#8216;I must go now,&#8217; announced Lucillia, rattled, &#8216;its best we don&#8217;t speak of this again.&#8217;

But Julia was past giving up; she threw herself at the girl&#8217;s feet and cried out, &#8216;please, please, please, I beg you!&#8217;

Lucillia pulled her foot free of her hostess&#8217;s clutches and made for the door. Inevitably Julia&#8217;s mood turned for the worse, &#8216;alright you little slut, get the hell out of my house!! And don&#8217;t come back!!

Lucillia took no time in getting out of the Palace, pausing only in the day room to retrieve her bag of silver coin. And then she was gone.

Julia, still on her knees wiped the tears from her lovely blue eyes. She then looked up at the slave who stood in silence fanning her. &#8216;GUARDS!!!&#8217; she hollered.

Within seconds three guards arrived in the chamber to find their employer now sitting on the bed. She tossed her head at the fan and ordered them, &#8216;take this slave out the back, slit his throat and bury him like a dog!&#8217;

They immediately grabbed the hapless slave and dragged him to the backyard. Here, without knowing why, they cut his throat and buried him next to a rubbish dump.

10
That evening Thomassio was brought from his recovery bed to the evening room. Here his Mistress brought his face between her voluptuous thighs and made him lick her most intimate parts.

Two Nubians fanned her. Slaves served her strong wine and two maids massaged, kissed and licked her feet.

Her entertainment was supplied by her two newest slaves, Cleta and &#8216;Lucillia&#8217; She had them shackled from a ceiling beam, just high enough that their feet didn&#8217;t touch the floor.

They were very close to each other and she ordered them to kiss. Cleta was in such a state of confusion he thought the girl was actually the Noble Lady he had grovelled to earlier. Once their mouths were interlocked, Julia commanded her skilled overseer to flog them.
As Thomassio licked away, she got steadily drunk and watched the pair of them receive the worst flogging ever witnessed at the Palace.

Long after they were both unconscious. Long after Julia had experienced three cunnilingus induced orgasms, the overseer continued to lacerate the flesh before him.

Eventually Julia stood up and let her goblet fall to the floor. &#8216;That&#8217;s enough!&#8217; she slurred. &#8216;If they&#8217;re still alive in the morning put them to work in my copper mine!&#8217;

She began to sway towards the exit, &#8216;and tell the foreman to work them to death!!&#8217;
