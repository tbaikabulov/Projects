the capture 
It was a beautiful sunny day that Prince Ilirabih had chosen to visit the South-western part of his father's empire Canaan. It was the first time that his prospective wife and Empress Helen joined his travels. As she originally came from Caphtor, Helen had always remained skeptical whether her new home could keep up with the glory of the rich cultural life on Crete. 
Therefore Prince Ilirabih was very pleased to see that this part of his father's empire was aspiring into new glory. It certainly wouldn't take many more years until the people of Canaan would be as proud about their empire as these snobby people from Caphtor. 
After they had absolved their standard visit-program to the local priests, Prince Ilirabih decided that it would provide a tremendous opportunity to show Helen the Mediterranean Sea as it was the ocean that connected her home island with her prospective empire Canaan. From the top of the cliffs they would have just a perfect view! And indeed the look of Helen's eyes was wandering over the horizon right to the direction of Caphtorim. 
“Do you see the sand dunes over there? Behind them starts the great desert that divides Canaan from the Egyptian Empire.” Ilirabih guided Helen's gaze to the left. The palms waved peacefully in the wind while white sea birds flew over their heads. Every little part was beautifully embedded into the greater picture of a just perfect landscape.

But suddenly around a dozen of armed men appeared behind the sand dunes, armed with short bows and lances and they didn't look very friendly. 
One minute later Prince Ilirabih Steven found himself in the middle of a furious fight. His royal guard fought bravely to defend their Prince against the overpowering attackers. 
But when Prince Ilirabih witnessed how easily the attackers managed to cut the throats of his best men, he had to face the unsettling fact that his royal guard had not the slightest chance to win this battle. 
So Prince Ilirabih just run! Without even looking back for his beloved Princess he kept running and running. As a pampered member of the royal family Prince Ilirabih was not very used to any physical activity and after a few hundred meters his totally exhausted body needed a break. 
The Prince felt very relieved when he turned around and saw no human being at all. It might have been a little tragic for the lost lives of his loyal guard-men and Princess Helen, but the only thing that counted in the end was the fact that he – the Prince and up-coming Emperor of Canaan had survived this threat. With the help of his father's army the Prince would soon start to hunt down every poor soul these coward attackers. And his justice would know no mercy to them! 
But as his heavy breathing became quieter, Prince Ilirabih began to hear another sound. Once more he turned around. His body remained paralyzed in shock as he faced a war chariot. This time there was no chance of fleeing as the speedy chariot appeared from the east and any possible way of escape was cut by the cliffs of the great Ocean in the west. So Prince Ilirabih could only pray that the leader of the war chariot had peaceful intentions.
As the war chariot came closer Prince Ilirabih recognized that it was lead by a female archer in a Egyptian war-dress with a small composite bow. She looked ravishing, but she definitely did not came for chatting! 
Prince Ilirabih knew that it required a lot of space to turn such a chariot and since the cliffs were so close it would take a lot of care and time to even turn it around 180°. So when the Egyptian woman stopped her chariot right in front of him, Prince Ilirabih took his little chance and ran straight forward.
He had just passed the chariot when he felt the sudden pain in his upper leg. This stupid cow was really nuts enough to shoot an arrow at him!!!
But before the Prince even could drag of the arrow, the poison on its top had already hammered him into unconsciousness.

a rude awaking 
It was a splash of ice-cold water that awoke the Prince from his unconsciousness.
As his senses gradually regained a flickering yellow light began to penetrate the blackness that had gripped him. The source of the water was a bucket in the hands of a huge man, who wore nothing but a loin cloth and a copper collar. The symbol of a cobra was burned into his upper arm and gave him a rude appearance. Without showing even the slightest act of respect the half-naked bastard began to grin at the wet Prince.
To his further embarrassment Prince Ilirabih had to discover that his wrists and ankles were tightly chained by heavy iron fetters to a dark wall. Still shocked about his helpless situation the Prince started to study his surroundings. And what he saw was not very reassuring : The small chamber was enclosed by stone block walls, while the ceiling consisted of heavy oak beams. The air was stifling which indicated that that the Prince might be at a very secret place deep below the surface of the earth. 
The feeling of panic began to arouse inside the Prince's mind. Therefore his voice trembled in despair when Prince Ilirabih finally shouted at the still shamelessly grinning man: “Funny – he? So tell me - what the hell do you want?” 
“It's irrelevant what he wants! Instead it should be my demands that have to concern you!” came an unexpected reply from the dark corner of the chamber. 
It was the soft voice of a woman, who slowly stepped out of the dark spot, revealing her ravishing beauty. She wore a dark blue cape which swept almost the floor and was clasped at the front by a diamond broach in the shape of snake. Was this the female archer on the chariot who had shoot her arrow at him? Prince Ilirabih wasn't sure. 
"Who are you?" 
"My name is Amisi. I am a Priestesses of Goddess Aishia and I'm here to help you finding the right way into your submission towards the Goddess."
"My submission? You must be joking - I'm the Royal Prince of Canaan and therefore I will never submit to anyone!"
Priestess Amisi just laughed wickedly at his vehement protests: "Of course you will!"
The Prince just starred at her in silent disbelieve, so Amisi added in cold amusement : "And if you want to remain healthy, you better start your submission quickly."
“You can't tell me what I should do!" the Prince still protested – although the quietness of his voice betrayed his rising insecurity. But his objection was still enough to raise Amisi anger. 
With predatory grace Priestess Amisi stalked over to the Prince. Her heels struck the floor with sounds which echoed in the silent room and let an instant of panic grip Prince Ilirabih's muscles.
Now she stood directly in front of him. So close that he even could feel her warm breath touching his face. And the Prince became even more scared of her when he looked into her dark mascaraed eyes. They sparkled as satanic as her mane of jet-black hair and exuded an aggressive sexuality.
Suddenly her Prince felt how his balls were rudely grabbed by her hands. Even through his clothes he could feel her nails squeezing into the most sensitive parts of his royal body. No-one had ever dared to touch him like this! But then again: he has never been a chained in front of a beautiful vixen as well.
Priestess Amisi moved her head even closer to him and hissed into his ear: "In the house of a Goddess your royalty counts nothing. I am the only friend you can find inside these walls - but my friendship has to be earned! So you better start to treat me with absolute respect."
She easily twisted his throbbing prick until the Prince groaned in pain. Her face showed nothing but joyful delight instead.
"Am I understood?" Amisi demanded with a merciless smile of triumph. 
Amisi licked her glistening red lips as the Prince finally nodded in surrender. Her hands padded his cheek like he would be just a pet for her. Starring into her darken eyes Ilirabih wondered how could such a beautiful creature have such a devilish spirit.
She just laughed at his obvious irritation: “I knew that we will get along very well. Now don't forget to do anything you can to keep me in a happy mood!" 
Then Amisi turned around to looked at her companion man, who was standing beside them with his eyes downcast.
Her voice became cold and very strict when Amisi ordered : “Bind him!”
The man just nodded at her command and obediently began to unchain the Prince's hands and feet from the wall - just to tightly encircle them again with different sets of steel cuffs one moment later. A ratcheting click told the Prince that the cuffs had been locked again. But he still didn't dare to struggle as the muscles of hand-man seemed strong enough to easily crumble the Prince's bones to dust. 
Amisi critically observed every little step of her stoic servant. But then Prince Ilirabih noticed a permanent anxiety in the movement of Amisi's servant. Could it be, that such a strong man like him was afraid of such a gracile woman like the Priestess?
Following his anxious gazes towards his mistress the Prince discovered how a black whip revealed under the blue cape of Priestess Amisi. A cold shudder run down the Prince's spine when he thought about the possibility that this whip in the delicate hands of the Priestess might have broken this strong man into submission. 
The Priestess caught the worried look of the Princes and answered his silent assumptions with a knowing smile. 
“I'm finished, Priestess Amisi!” interrupted the man.
She just raised her dark eye-browns and snapped in a superior tone: “Then open the door and let's go, stupid!”
The Princes had never even seen such a commanding bitch in his homeland Canaan. Her arrogant behavior was shocking, but in as the same time the Prince felt somehow attracted to her. Or better: he felt bewitched by her. All this unknown emotions made him feel very uneasy when he was escorted up some stairs and out of the dungeon rooms. 

way to the divine quarters 
Then they reached a long hallway. Priestess Amisi walked ahead, leading the way. The Prince followed obediently behind her as her nearby servant was always ready to break any resistance for his mistress. 
The Prince was amazed by the opulent luxury of the Colonnades where golden flambeaus cast a soft glow off the highly-polished marble floors. Not even the Royal Throne room of his father's places contained so much pure pomp. 
The Priestess glanced at the deeply awed Prince with a playful smile on her perfectly formed red lips. She wasn't flirting with him, was she? For the first time in his young life Ilirabih felt shy in front of a woman. 
Priestess Amisi just kept smiling mercilessly at his red face and silently enjoyed the obvious discomfort she caused inside the Prince's poor mind. She liked how his brown eyes glowed beneath his chestnut curls and she also liked the well-defined lines of his face. He soon would become a very pleasant toy to play with. 
But all too soon Amisi's sweet thoughts were interrupted by the Prince's stutters : “What...I mean where are you... are you taking me?” 
“I'll prepare you for an audience with Goddess Aishia.” 
“Prepare me?” 
“Of course, sweety. Her audience is a great privilege that is granted to only a few selected souls. But you will disgrace her divine nose as long as you still wear the smell of your lousy desert-country Canaan. Therefore I will take care that you get rid of your clothes and take a bath first!” 
Has this Priestess just called him “sweety” ??? 
He was aware of his own beauty and the effect it had on women - but at home in Canaan he would immediately have let Amisi been executed for her shown disrespect. Unfortunately he found himself in situation of very limited power now. So the Prince just bit on his tongue, trying to accept his new state of helplessness. 
Soon they entered a small atrium. It had the shape of a rectangle and was surrounded by four strong walls. A bathing pool with clean, blue water was embedded in the middle of the court. 
Some male and female servants were chatting beside the bathing pool, but as soon as they noticed the presence of the Priestess they bowed their head and bashfully walked away. Only the birds kept singing in the bright sunshine of a wonderful day. 
“Undress him!” the Priestess suddenly ordered her servant, who immediately began to cut off the Prince's clothes with a small, sharp knife. 
“Take away your dirty hands! I'm the Royal Prince of Canaan! You must be crazy if you think you can just undress like any peasant!” Prince Ilirabih shouted a the servant in pure rage. 
But then the Prince felt the calming hands of the Priestess on his shoulders. Putting herself in front of the Prince she lazily stroked her fingers around his neck. 
With an enticing smile on her face she whispers: “Do you really think that it is a good idea to oppose a servant who is following my commands?” 
The Prince had to swallow hard before he could reply in a clear voice: “All I know is, that I'm still the Prince of Canaan and therefore deserve to be treated with proper respect.” 
Raising an eyebrow in surprise at this proud reply the Priestess asked: “Really? How do you like this kind of treatment then?“ 
With a sudden and totally unexpected move her knee rammed into the Prince's groin. Prince Ilirabih collapsed on the hard floor, where he kept screaming in an indescribable agony. The Priestess must have hoped for this reaction as a satisfied grin spreads across her face. 
But this grin kept hidden from the Prince as he looked only at her dedicate feet that stood dangerously close to his face. 
“Would you please let my servant undress you now, my sweet Prince?” the Prince was asked by her mocking voice. 
But the Prince was unable to answer her as his whole mind was concentrating to block out the agonizing pain that raged in his groin. So the Priestess placed one of the feet at the Princes head in triumph. With a short nod she ordered her servant to go on undressing her captive. 
A moment later Prince Ilirabih could feel one powerful hand of Amisi's servant holding his body while the other hand cut his clothes. Desperately the Prince tried to pull his wrists free from the restraints but in the end all his struggling kept fruitless. During all this act of sheer terror the sun shone innocently with all her bright and in an ironic contradiction to the Princes scandalous sufferings. 
It took only a few seconds until Prince Ilirabih was as naked as he was at the day he was born. (Although there was still this slight but very crucial difference that Prince Ilirabih wasn't chained at the day he was born.) The Prince closed his eyes, hoping that everything was just a bad dream. But too soon his hopes got interrupted by the voice of Amisi who ordered him from highly above to pick a piece of soap and crawl into the water for bath. 
Fitfully the broken Prince moved his body forward into the pool. Scented with rose oil and wildflower petals, the delicate scent rising from the water. Despite the initial chill, the perfumed water also caused him a burning sting at his upper leg - making him remember the little wound he had suffered when her arrow had hit Prince Ilirabih. 
While he was clumsily washing his royal but captive body with chained hands and a rough soap, the Prince enviously glimpsed at the dis-royal but free birds. They felicitously sang their untroubled songs – just as if the would laugh at him. 
Then his gaze wandered to his beautiful but so unexpectedly resolute wardress. Priestess Amisi had sat herself on a stone bench with her legs crossed and her hands leaned back behind her. She looked brazenly content and relaxed while the Prince was forced to perform his very public ablutions as her prisoner. But after all the Prince enjoyed his bath very much as the caressing ministrations of the water refreshed his hurt body and soul. 
“Time to get out, sweety!” he suddenly heard Priestess Amisi's commanding voice. 
She now stood on the edge of the bathing pool holding two straps of thin leather and some kind of cloth in her left hand. There was something about the erect manner of her posture that hinted at the pride she took in having been placed in charge of such a royal captive like him. 
Her dark eyes watched every move of Prince Ilirabih, when he slowly stepped out of the bathing pool and placed himself in front of his new mistress. He stood still a little unsteady on his shivering legs as he still felt the fire of her harsh kick burning in his groin. A small grin rushed over Amisi's lips as she noticed this exploitable weakness before she let her fingers of her free hand ran over his unprotected cock and balls. "Oh sweety!" she softly giggled, 
"Look how tiny your royal jewelry had become inside the cold water. It must be quite embarrassing for you when it gets so small?!" she taunted. 
Her inquiring eyes kept looking at him without mercy until Prince Ilirabih quietly confessed to her: “It is!”. 
The Priestess laughed out in triumph. “Don't worry, sweety. It will be a pleasure for me to take care of your small jewelry.” 
With that she began to circle one of her thin leather straps tightly around his balls. The second strap was wrapped similarly around his balls and the base of his cock until it slightly cut into his sensual skin. 
"As you start to get an erection, the straps are going trap the blood in your cock, which will prolong the time it will take for your semi-erection to subside!" Priestess Amisi explained to her victim, while her fingertips casually slowly caressed the length of the underside of my cock. It didn't take long until the cock grew. 
"Ups! Was it me who caused this erection?" Amisi mocked sanctimoniously.
The Prince felt a deep urge to protest, but he just couldn't think of anything to say. So the Prince send a killing glance at her sarcasm. But unfortunately Amisi remained unimpressed by his harmless anger. 
“It's too bad for you that you obviously can't control your little snake, because your new cloths will unfortunately only consist of this stylish garment.” she exclaimed and tied a white loincloth on his hips. But as the Princes erection lifted the cloth up into the air, the loincloth actually revealed more then it covered. A little smile curled her lips, as she thought about the coming intimidations that this loincloth would cause the Prince. 
“Please...” he whined, when he finally began to understand that he wouldn't get any more clothes to cover his intimidating arousal if front of Queen Aishia. 
“Please what?” 
“Please let me have some of my old cloths.” 
“How sweet! You are begging me already! Oh my poor Prince – I know how intimidated you must feel but I won't help you. First of all the Divine Queen has ordered me to present you in this 'frank' outfit and furthermore I just enjoy your cute embarrassment too much. And you prefer when I keep my happy mood, don't you?” 
Prince Ilirabih just starred at Amisi's bold explanation in state of helplessness that he had never experienced before. 
Priestess Amisi used his hush to continue in a cold matter-of-factly voice: “We are nearly ready for your audience with Goddess Aishia. But the fact, that your Supreme Owner demands to see you, doesn't mean that you already deserve the privilege to see her!” 
“What do you mean...?” Ilirabih asked but he was promptly silenced by Amisi's forefinger that she placed on his lips mysteriously. 
Then she began to slowly pull a long silk scarf from her waist that had served as a kind of belt so far. 
Taking it into both of her hands she stepped behind him and gently draped the scarf over his eyes, tying it tightly behind the Prince's head. 
Prince Ilirabih breathe grew ragged as his world was shut out. Now he could only hear how Amisi snapped her fingers and the footsteps of her servant coming closer. Some kind of leash was attached to the stripes that encircled his cock and with an abrupt jerk on the leash the Prince was forced to step forward. 
“Ready to go?” he heard Amisi asking him, but before he even could reply, the Prince was already led out of the room by his cock leash. 
He banged into walls and door jams. More than once the Prince even felt down. But Amisi always just kept walking on, tugging harder on his leash until he scrambled back to his feet to follow her. 
After maybe one minute of walk he bumped into a set of stairs. The steps felt cold on his feet – like a strange kind of metal. Could it be that the stairs were made of pure gold?! No! That would have been just too expensive even for such an exclusive palace like this one, wouldn't it? 
A door was opened and instinctively the Prince knew that they were now entering the private quarters of Goddess Aishia. His heart began to beat faster and he became just too excited to walk on. One moment later a painful tug on his cock-leash still made him stumbled along after Amisi into the awe-inspiring room.

[ Synopsis ]

The narcissistic, yet ingenuous claimant to the throne of the ancient Empire of Canaan gets kidnapped by a special task force of the Egyptian Queen Aishia.

A moment later Prince Ilirabih could feel one powerful hand of Amisi's servant holding his body while the other hand cut his clothes. Desperately the Prince tried to pull his wrists free from the restraints but in the end all his struggling kept fruitless. During all this act of sheer terror the sun shone innocently with all her bright and in an ironic contradiction to the Princes scandalous sufferings.



It took only a few seconds until Prince Ilirabih was as naked as he was at the day he was born. (Although there was still this slight but very crucial difference that Prince Ilirabih wasn't chained at the day he was born.) The Prince closed his eyes, hoping that everything was just a bad dream. But too soon his hopes got interrupted by the voice of Amisi who ordered him from highly above to pick a piece of soap and crawl into the water for bath.



Fitfully the broken Prince moved his body forward into the pool. Scented with rose oil and wildflower petals, the delicate scent rising from the water. Despite the initial chill, the perfumed water also caused him a burning sting at his upper leg - making him remember the little wound he had suffered when her arrow had hit Prince Ilirabih.



While he was clumsily washing his royal but captive body with chained hands and a rough soap, the Prince enviously glimpsed at the dis-royal but free birds. They felicitously sang their untroubled songs – just as if the would laugh at him.



Then his gaze wandered to his beautiful but so unexpectedly resolute wardress. Priestess Amisi had sat herself on a stone bench with her legs crossed and her hands leaned back behind her. She looked brazenly content and relaxed while the Prince was forced to perform his very public ablutions as her prisoner. But after all the Prince enjoyed his bath very much as the caressing ministrations of the water refreshed his hurt body and soul.





"Time to get out, sweety!" he suddenly heard Priestess Amisi's commanding voice.



She now stood on the edge of the bathing pool holding two straps of thin leather and some kind of cloth in her left hand. There was something about the erect manner of her posture that hinted at the pride she took in having been placed in charge of such a royal captive like him.



Her dark eyes watched every move of Prince Ilirabih, when he slowly stepped out of the bathing pool and placed himself in front of his new mistress. He stood still a little unsteady on his shivering legs as he still felt the fire of her harsh kick burning in his groin. A small grin rushed over Amisi's lips as she noticed this exploitable weakness before she let her fingers of her free hand ran over his unprotected cock and balls. "Oh sweety!" she softly giggled,





"Look how tiny your royal jewelry had become inside the cold water. It must be quite embarrassing for you when it gets so small?!" she taunted.





Her inquiring eyes kept looking at him without mercy until Prince Ilirabih quietly confessed to her: "It is!"





The Priestess laughed out in triumph. "Don't worry, sweety. It will be a pleasure for me to take care of your small jewelry."





With that she began to circle one of her thin leather straps tightly around his balls. The second strap was wrapped similarly around his balls and the base of his cock until it slightly cut into his sensual skin.





"As you start to get an erection, the straps are going trap the blood in your cock, which will prolong the time it will take for your semi-erection to subside!" Priestess Amisi explained to her victim, while her fingertips casually slowly caressed the length of the underside of my cock. It didn't take long until the cock grew.





"Ups! Was it me who caused this erection?" Amisi mocked sanctimoniously.





The Prince felt a deep urge to protest, but he just couldn't think of anything to say. So the Prince send a killing glance at her sarcasm. But unfortunately Amisi remained unimpressed by his harmless anger.



"It's too bad for you that you obviously can't control your little snake, because your new cloths will unfortunately only consist of this stylish garment." she exclaimed and tied a white loincloth on his hips. But as the Princes erection lifted the cloth up into the air, the loincloth actually revealed more then it covered. A little smile curled her lips, as she thought about the coming intimidations that this loincloth would cause the Prince.





"Please..." he whined, when he finally began to understand that he wouldn't get any more clothes to cover his intimidating arousal if front of Queen Aishia.





"Please what?"





"Please let me have some of my old cloths."





"How sweet! You are begging me already! Oh my poor Prince – I know how intimidated you must feel but I won't help you. First of all the Divine Queen has ordered me to present you in this 'frank' outfit and furthermore I just enjoy your cute embarrassment too much. And you prefer when I keep my happy mood, don't you?"





Prince Ilirabih just starred at Amisi's bold explanation in state of helplessness that he had never experienced before.



Priestess Amisi used his hush to continue in a cold matter-of-factly voice: "We are nearly ready for your audience with Goddess Aishia. But the fact, that your Supreme Owner demands to see you, doesn't mean that you already deserve the privilege to see her!"





"What do you mean...?" Ilirabih asked but he was promptly silenced by Amisi's forefinger that she placed on his lips mysteriously.



Then she began to slowly pull a long silk scarf from her waist that had served as a kind of belt so far.



Taking it into both of her hands she stepped behind him and gently draped the scarf over his eyes, tying it tightly behind the Prince's head.



Prince Ilirabih breathe grew ragged as his world was shut out. Now he could only hear how Amisi snapped her fingers and the footsteps of her servant coming closer. Some kind of leash was attached to the stripes that encircled his cock and with an abrupt jerk on the leash the Prince was forced to step forward.



"Ready to go?" he heard Amisi asking him, but before he even could reply, the Prince was already led out of the room by his cock leash.



He banged into walls and door jams. More than once the Prince even felt down. But Amisi always just kept walking on, tugging harder on his leash until he scrambled back to his feet to follow her.



After maybe one minute of walk he bumped into a set of stairs. The steps felt cold on his feet – like a strange kind of metal. Could it be that the stairs were made of pure gold?! No! That would have been just too expensive even for such an exclusive palace like this one, wouldn't it?



A door was opened and instinctively the Prince knew that they were now entering the private quarters of Goddess Aishia. His heart began to beat faster and he became just too excited to walk on. One moment later a painful tug on his cock-leash still made him stumbled along after Amisi into the awe-inspiring room.





[ The initial audience ]



After he was led five more steps into the room, he heard Amisi's familiar voice again: "Take your hands behind your head and keep standing still!"





In his utter blindness Prince Ilirabih felt much too helpless to even think about the possibility of resisting her order. Instead he presented himself as being told and obediently waited for the things to come. No-one in this room dared to say a word anymore.



In didn't take long until he heard the hard clicking-sound of shoe-soles on the stone floor. An unknown person was approaching him from the left. This must have been Goddess Aishia as the Prince definitely heard the sound of two or three men crawling behind her.



A loud snap of her fingers echoed through the silence of the room and the men eagerly rushed away. Now the Prince heard foot-steps walking around him like someone was inspecting his naked body. Then the sound of the foot-steps ended – the inspecting person must have been standing directly behind him. The Prince's muscular body began to shutter.





"He looks lean and strong. What a cute addition for my palace!" a female voice suddenly stated. It echoed as smooth and sweet as honey in Ilirabih's ears. This could only be the voice of Goddess Aishia!





"But still a little bit to anxious for a real Prince, don't you think?"





"Indeed. But maybe his anxiety will prove itself very useful as there are still so many manners that he will have to learn here, my Goddess!" Ilirabih heard Amisi answer.





In the meantime some warm fingers touched his spine and run over his taut cheeks. Suddenly a pair of fingernails squeezed lightly into the skin of his ass. A shudder coursed through his body.





"I especially like his nice, tight behind. It certainly makes punishing him a much more pleasurable experience."



The Prince had always been proud of the masculine shape of body, but at this moment he felt nothing else but utter intimidation. The foreign hand kept moving up again, running over the Prince's shoulder bladed.





"Did he gave you any trouble?"





"Not the kind of trouble that I couldn't handle!"





"Obviously!"





Suddenly the foreign hand on his back retreated and Prince Ilirabih heard the faint rustling of silk. Goddess Aishia circled to the other side of her prisoner. Once more her hand reached out for a physical inspection. The Prince felt her fingertip wandering across the muscled surface of his chest.





"A soft, smooth chest and nice broad shoulders as well. Just as a man should be. No Egyptian woman wants weakness in her bed!"





The darkness of the scarf around his eyes let the Prince focus even deeper on the seductive sensations that the foreign hand inflicted upon his skin. Soon Goddess Aishia could hear his breathing become shallow.





"Oh – I hope my talking hasn't made you feel uncomfortable?"&nbsp; Aishia joyfully mocked at his undeniable embarrassment.





One moment later her hand snaked between his legs and lightly cupped his balls, that were still tightly tied by Amisi's leathern straps.



Aishia let the weight of the Royal balls rest against her open palm reveling in their size and firmness until the Prince let out a barely controlled quiver. At this moment her wicked hand closed - squeezing his balls painfully against each other.



The Prince had to eagerly press his teeth together to prevent him from crying out loud – this would only mean his first step of surrender to her devilish torture.



But then her heated whisper reached his ears. "Such beautiful balls . I’m glad they belong to me now. Mine to do with as I choose."



Her soft voice was followed by an exotic smell – it was a strange combination of sweat flowers and bitter spices. But the Prince was still keen not to get manipulated by Aishia's poisoning charm.





"Soon my father's army will liberate me. Then it will be my joy to burn down your palace to the ground."





A icy silence laid over the room. Still blinded by the scarf the Prince could only assume what kind of effect his outburst might had had on his captors.



Then his blindfold was ripped off with a harsh tug. The Prince suddenly looked directly into her intimidating dark eyes. The dark-red lips of Goddess Aishia curled into a cruel smile.





"You father is indeed worried about your safe return home! But unfortunately my Egyptian forces has already crushed his main army while you were lying passed out in one of my private prison cells. Now I have given your father a good reason to be really worried, don't you think? In fact he had just sent a messenger to my royal palace offering me the whole capital city of Canaan in exchange of your release!"





"What? That can't be.... What... I mean....have you accepted this offer?"





"No! Why should I? My glorious army will conquer the capital of Canaan during the next weeks anyway. Canaan will become just one more Egyptian province that would supply my glorious empire with slaves."



"So why am I kept here then?"



"You are only here in the name of fun! My fun to be precise! Breaking a pampered and self-centered Prince like you would be a just too joyful challenge for me. And as long as I’m entertained, you will be kept alive and reasonably healthy. So satisfy me as much as you can, little Prince, and hope it never ends. Because when it’s over, it’s really over!"





"This are just empty treats. It's a sin to execute a captured member of his enemy's royal family."





"But with the fall of the Canaan Empire your not a prisoner anymore! Inside these walls you will be nothing more then a slave - my slave!"



"P-p-please...." the Prince tried to babble out some plea, but a courageous face-slap of Aishia immediately silenced him before he managed to reach the second word.





"Listen to me, Ilirabih!" she hissed. "During the next days you will have to learn that your days of pointless, worthless drifting are over. You are mine now and so you live now only to gratify me. And I will make sure that you are never going to leave this place alive."





As there was nothing he could do, the Prince decided to play along for now. But deep inside his soul he kept hoping that his fathers army might be still intact and ready to rescue him. As soon as he would be free again, he would take revenge for the humiliations Aishia had made him suffer. He would also take bitter revenge for the Canaan people, his father and Helen. Oh god – Helen! How could he have forgotten her?





"Want have you done to Helen?" he shouted at Aishia.





"To whom?"





"To my fiancée?"





"Oh I see! You finally remember her? - One of my Priestess will take care of her until she is trained to become a Concubine."





"You can't...!"





"Of course I can!" the Goddess sneered. "After the occupation of Canaan into the Egyptian Empire both of you are going to become totally irrelevant for the world. No one will ever miss you."





"Oh – don't look so shocked. I tell you something: I can have her back and do whatever you want to do to her. No-one will hold you back even if you decide to do nasty things to her body and soul."





A glimmer of raising hope appeared in Ilirabih's eyes. "Do you promise to do that for me?"





"Yes! But before I will give her to you, you have to pass a challenge for me. Within one week you and Helen are going to compete for my favor. After this week I will decide who of you have pleased me more. If you fail, I will hand you over to her mercy instead!"





"Helen will never accept to play such a wicked game."





"Oh – she already did! In fact, she seemed more than delighted by the prospect of getting unrestricted access to your balls. She won't mad at you because you left her alone in the desert during the attack of my soldiers, will she?"



A horrified expression crossed the Prince's face, which made Aishia laugh out loud. Tossing back her head, the mane of her hair swept around her naked breasts like a cloud.



The Prince stammered out weakly: "I...I...I will do what it takes to please you more than Helen does."





"Great - I’m going to have some amazing fun playing with both of you."





"Let's start with learning some manners – from now on I am nothing but your 'Supreme Owner and Divine Queen' to you! You got that?"





"Yes, my Supreme Owner and Divine Queen." pressed Ilirabih through is lips, struggling hard to repress his rising anger.



Ilirabih squeezed his eyes shut and dug his fingers into his palms – fighting to remain motionless.





"You're learning fast. I like that!" Her eyes glared at him.





"Okay - ready for the second lesson? When I walk, I expect you to follow me on your knees and kiss the places where my feet have touched the marble floor."



Menacingly she walked away from him, granting Prince Ilirabih a look at her whole body.



The young goddess was dressed in a sleeveless white over-garment in a very sexy one shoulder style and long flowing panel in back, highlighted by a shimmery silver border.



The golden glowing of her arms and shoulders created a marvelous contract to the whiteness of her dress. In fact her skin looked really goddess-like: taut, firm, silky-smooth and free of any imperfection. The Prince's cock began to ache.



But then the Goddess turned around to look after him. As she saw him still standing her expression turned cold in anger.





"Don't tax my patience by playing deaf! Your are to follow me on your knees and kissing the floor."





She had placed her hands on her hips, her legs were slightly parted. The coiled poise of her excitingly taut body was as threatening as her words Still the Prince tried hard to remain strong and not to give in to her crazy demands.





"No – a Royal Prince like me can't undergo such a disgracing act!" Ilirabih quietly argued.





Goddess Aishia just sighed at his response, shaking her head in disapproval. But suddenly as devilish smirk appeared at her lips and approached back to him.



"Very well, then I'm afraid that I will have to use more convincing methods to train you," she cooed, while her fingers slowly pinching a fold of skin from his cheek and rested a nail point at either side.



"You can whip me as long as you want - you will never break my spirit. The spirit of a Canaan Prince can never be broken." he said a little too quickly to express real confidence in his words.



The Goddess smiled and released his cheek. "Who has said that I will need a whip to break you? No - your lovely body would bring me much more pleasure if I leave it intact."



The Prince decided that it might be better to mute for a while and wait for the things she was going to inflict upon him.



Aishia just needed to snap her manicured fingers and Priestess Amisi steeped forward, ready to receive a new command from her Goddess.





"Go and get me some 'wafers of persuasion'!" Amisi was ordered and instantly returned a knowing smirk to Aishia. At the next moment Amisi was already walking away to fetch these obscure wafers of persuasion, which Ilirabih never had heard before. So he remained wondering whether his beautiful captor was going to force the Prince into submission by throwing wafers at him?!





The Priestess had nearly left the chamber, when Aishia shouted behind her: "Wait! Bring a bowl of cold Irep Dedjem for me as well!"



(Irep Dedjem is the Egyptian name for the exclusive beverage that is nowadays known as sweet wine.)





The echo of the Priestess' footsteps slowly faded away and for the first time the Prince found himself being totally alone in the intimidating presence of Goddess Aishia.



He stood still and quietly savoring the awkward moment in his mind. But soon his look cautiously began to flick out over his new 'owner'. With her tall body and her self-assured aura the so-called 'Goddess' indeed seemed to be an icon of divine femininity.



Suddenly Aishia's lively eyes caught him watching her and the Ilirabih instinctively lashed his look back to the ground. He still felt her watching eyes wandering over his skin, but still he didn't dare to move. Why was he allowing her to gain the control over this situation? He knew that he still represented the next Emperor of Canaan but something deep inside his consciousness had slipped into the kind of mind-set that made him feel like he already had become one of Aishia's slaves. And was even more worrying was the thought that being her slave felt like the right place to be.





Echoing footsteps indicated the reappearance of Amisi and her lackey and made the Prince freeze in anticipation of the things that were to come.





Ilirabih watched Amisi devotedly approaching Aishia, where she knelt down before her Goddess and presented her a bowl of fresh Irep Dedjem.





"Thanks, my dear! But don't forget to feed our special guest too!"





"It will be a pleasure, my Goddess!" Amisi responded, before she stood up again, turned around and moved to Ilirabih. The sinister smile on her face made Ilirabih feel a little uneasy.



Without even looking at her servant, she grabbed for two of the wafers, which her servant were dutifully holding out for her.



Prince Ilirabih instinctively knew that he wouldn't enjoy the taste of these wafers, so he firmly pressed his lips close against each other.



It only took a commanding nod of Amisi to let her servants strong fists grab Ilirabih's wrists from behind. Held in this iron grip the Prince couldn't stop Amisi from easily pinching his nose shut with the thumb and forefinger of her free hand. There was a bit of struggle as he held his breath, eyes darting about frantically. Only a few moments later the Prince aching lungs burst out to suck in a huge amount of life-saving air. Immediately Amisi pushed the wafers into his mouth and effectively closed it with the palm of her hand before he could spit it out again.





The Prince felt how his saliva was slowly soaked the wafers into a fluid lotion. And this lotion had an extreme spicy taste. In fact it was hotter than anything the Prince has ever tasted before. Soon his throat had gone sore and the Prince began to cough and choke behind the delicate hand that Amisi kept still firmly pressed against his mouth. His pleading eyes searched for a glimmer of sympathy in Amisi's face – only to see that her eyes sparkled in sadistic amusement. He wouldn't find any mercy in her.



But as a terrible thirst kept tormenting his throat, the Prince looked out for his Owner (and Protector?) Aishia.





She had seated herself casually on the edge of a nearby column-plinth, enjoying the shown spectacle as well as her nearly full bowl of chilled Irep Dedjem.





"Don't you like your food?" she laughed at the sight of the Princes obvious misery.





Ilirabih could just make desperate facial expression, so Aishia sent her Priestess a nod, commanding her to release her hand from his mouth. Although his mouth was free again, the Prince had to fought his aching throat into use again before he croaked out: "Please...drink..."



The Goddess grin widened. She took a deep gulp of Irep Dedjem from her bowl.





"You want a drink of my bowl? Don't you think that it would be presumptuous for a slave like you to put your lowly lips to the same bowl as mine?" she asked teasingly



The Prince knew that he shouldn't allow himself to take part on her wicked little game, but at this moment all he cared for was to find a possibility to drink and get free from these hot spices which terrorized his mouth.





"Please, Goddess Aishia. I beg you for something to drink."



"I guess your begging would look more convincing to me if you do in on your knees." Aishia smiled at him with blissful savor, while she took another sip from the bowl.





Her never permanently growing demands were maddening. Still the Prince couldn't afford to delay the prospect of getting something to drink. Obediently he advanced the short distance to Aishia's plinth, where he knelt down quite awkwardly (as his wrists where still bound together) and looked at his new Goddess with pleading eyes.





"Well…since you ask that nicely, I assume that I could grant you your wish." Aishia finally whispered in her most lovely voice, before she rose from the plinth, carrying her bowl in one hand.





"I will share my Irep Dedjem with you, but there’s no way your lips are going where my lips have been." she exclaimed and let a straight of exclusive wine pour to the marble ground in front of the still so desperately thirsty Prince. The Prince just looked up at her in disbelieve.





"So do you want to drink or not?" she grinned down at him, while she licked away some sweet drops from her own lips.





The Prince looked at the puddle of wine in front of him. After all it was still sweet wine. Licking it off from the ground would be extremely embarrassing, but it seemed to be his only choice to satisfy his urge for a drink. He were just leading his kneeling body forward to take a lick of the puddle, when Aishia's leathern scandal stepped directly into the so valuable puddle .





"Maybe you will enjoy your drink a little more, if it gets spiced up by the divine dust of my shoe-sole!" the Goddess' sarcastically-innocent voice called out from above.





This couldn't be true! How could a lovely being like her be so mischievous, the Prince asked himself. But then he understood. As the soles of Aishia's sandals were disperse the valuable wine all over the marble floor, the Prince would have to lick (or better kiss) the places where her feet have touched the ground. But this was exactly the humiliating task of Aishia's 'second lesson' that he had just so eagerly refused to obey.



The Prince considered to draw a final line here and stop to humiliate himself any longer. He would have to sustain the burning pain of the spices inside his mouth but if he really focused on his will-power, he might made it.





"You better instantly start to take your drink, sweety!" he was suddenly commanded by Priestess Amisi. Her voice was spiked with a dangerously undertone.





The Prince cowardly gazed up at her. With her arms folded over her breasts Amisi had placed herself right next to him and seemed to watch his inner struggles with sadistic interest.



The Prince felt how his power of resistance melted under the fire that burned into her dark shadowed eyes. He also became aware how vulnerable he was in his kneeling position. A shudder run down the Prince's spine as he thought about the possibility to gain another painful kick from Amisi's fatal legs.



So he just tightly shut his eyes and forced his head to lower over one of the little wine puddles that Aishia's sandals had created for him. Bearing his mental disgust Ilirabih opened his mouth and licked of the wine from the ground.

Nothing had ever tasted so good as that sweet wine, soothing his tender swollen gullet. As a the puddles had finally been licked off, the Prince's throat felt so much better.





His relief must have been quite obvious as Goddess Aishia started to laugh down at him. There was no hiding place from his exposure. And the desperate look in the Prince's eyes even told Aishia how shockingly embarrassed the Prince felt under her mischievous laughter





"Being my slave means giving up any right to choose. You do understand that now, don't you?"



The crestfallen Prince nodded.





"Well! Tonight you will furthermore learn who will be in control over your pleasure. You will have to learn that being my slave also means that I can exclude you from any satisfying feeling when I desire it. So are you ready for your third lesson?"
