��������� Water Springs. A small town somewhere in the middle of Alberta. That where his bitch of an editor told him to go, so
off he went. What could attract a veteran reporter like Matthew Mansell to a
small rural town like Water Springs, you asked?

��������� Well, the answer is very simple. Water Springs is the only place
in Canada where woman do not have the vote. It all began 18
months ago. There was an election for the town mayor. The incumbent was a
shoo-in. He was so strong that no one wanted to stand against him, except for a
man named Richard Evans. 

Evans
was an ex-hippie. You know the serious kind who went traveling all over India, Nepal and China in the seventies. He formed a political party called
M.A.P or the Male Alpha Party. He propose to go back to the old ways where only
men matter. That�s means no vote for woman, only men for senior positions and
that women are considered property of their fathers, husbands and (if they are
deceased) sons. A roadmap back to where men matters. A map back to the time
where men are men and women are women. All puns intended! No one, including
Evans, took his bid seriously. He was the joke candidate to the straight mayor.
All reports were that he just stood for election to give people a contest. No
one was laughing a week into the contest though. 

There
was a fire in town which gutted 5 houses, seems that the houses were built
without proper safety features. When it was discovered 6 months before the fire,
the local property company paid off the mayor to look the other way. The resulting
scandal destroyed the mayor�s chances for re-election. Which is probably a good
thing as said ex-mayor is currently serving time for corruption. So, the joke candidate
began the mayor. 

Everything
was fine at first. Evans didn�t do anything stupid. Then 9 months into his
term, a guy half-jokingly asked him when he�s going to take the vote from the
women. Evans said that it was important to keep his word. He then set a date
for a vote on the issue fully expecting it to fail. To the amazement of all,
the bill passed and the women found themselves without the vote. 

That�s
when the provincial government got involved. They
demanded that the town get rid of the law. Evans offered to hold the vote again
but the provincial government stupidly refused. Instead, they demanded that the
law be struck off immediately. This got the town in an uproar. It was their
vote and even if it wasn�t the result they expected, it was their choice. The
town found strange support from outside. Everyone agreed that another vote was
the best solution. Under pressure, the provincial government finally relented.
Another vote was held and in this one, the bill passed in a landslide. It was
the town people giving the finger to big government. Even the women voted for
the bill and the provincial government washed their hands on the matter.

A year has gone by and now Matthew Mansell is on his way to write a dirty rotten
story on the town; about the oppression of women right here in liberal Canada. The kind of story that�s sure to sell a lot of
newspapers.

As
he rolls into town, Mansell was surprise by the size of Water Springs. It was
bigger than what his editor told him and seems to be a pretty normal place. But
that was nothing compare to his shock that the motel was full.

&nbsp;

�You�re full! You got to be
kidding!�

�No. Sorry Mr. Mansell, we
pretty pack. Lots of tourists you know, and only 2 motels in the whole town.�
The man at the desk was Terry Bogart. He�s the son of the owner and the man
delivering the impossible news. For a town like Water Springs to have a full
motel was practically unheard of.

�Wait, you said there are 2
motels in town?�

�Yes, the other one is across
town. But it�s more popular than ours so your chances are even worse there.�

�You have nothing?�

�Well�a couple is to leave
today. But it�s only 9am;
they don�t have to book out till 11. If you don�t mind the wait�� 

�Sure, I�ll wait.� Mat grimly
agreed. �Did you say the town has a lot of visitors?�

�Sure do. Ever since the bill
passing, the tourist hasn�t stop coming.� Terry happily agreed. �Evans did a
hell of a job so far. Passing the law was the best thing to happen to this
town.�

�Why?� No need to ask which
law Terry was talking about.

�Everyone wants to see the
town. Last time, people just stayed on the freeway, but since the bill passed
everyone stopped by to see Water Springs. It�s like they are obliged to stop
and see the only place where woman don�t have the vote. The law put Water
Springs on the map.�

No question there. Mat never
even heard of the town before the bill. �But some would say that it�s on the
map for the wrong reasons Terry. You don�t mind me calling you Terry right?�

�Not a problem Mr. Mansell.�

�Please, call me Mat.�

�Okay. Would we be having
this conversation right now if not for the bill? I mean that�s why you�re here
right. As long as people stop in town and spend money�I don�t care why they
stopped by.�

�Oh�I guess that make sense.
The bill is good for business I guess.�

�The fucking best. Before, we�ll
be lucky to have this place half-full. Now, I actually have to turn people
away.�

�What do the women thinks of
this?�

�There�s money to make for
all. Most of them are happy as hell the town is booming.�

Mat heard an opening. �Most,
but not all. Who would you say is unhappy?�

�Hell if I know. But there
must be some though. Tell you what, there�s still about 2 hours till 11, why
don�t you go to Harry�s across the road. Have some breakfast, they make a mean
pancake.�

�That sounds like a great
idea. Thanks.�

�Not a problem.�

��������� Mat walked out of the lobby and cross the street. He was
vaguely troubled by his talk with Terry. That the bill had turned the town into
some sort of tourist attraction was something he had not counted on. Still with
such a law, there shouldn�t be too much of a problem finding someone who is
unhappy. With that, Mat entered Harry�s Diner.

&nbsp;

Somewhere in town,

��������� Richard Evans was less than happy when the phone rang. He
was in the middle of something but he is the mayor and duty comes first.

�Evans here. Who is this?�

�Mr. Evans, this is Terry.
Some guy just came in and asked a truckload of questions. Might be some sort of
reporter.�

�Another one? Where�s he
now?�

�I sent him over to Harry�s.
But he plan on staying for 3-4 days and he asked about who was unhappy about
the law.�

�Terry, you leave that to me.
Harry�s huh, get your father and both of you keep an eye on him. I�ll send John
over there. Good work Terry.�

�Thanks Mr. Evans. I�ll call
my father now.� 

��������� Richard
Evans wasn�t too worried as he put down the phone. Reporters are always
troublesome, but young Terry is a smart man. With his father beside him, the
reporter has to be pretty damm good to find anything. And if he is that good,
well that�s what John is for.

With
duty over, Evans turns back to pleasure. The woman kneeling in front of him has
a name, a name everyone in town knows. Evans however knows her by a different
name. �Shitface, I have a job for you.� Shitface smiled. 

&nbsp;

Harry�s Diner

Terry
was right. The diner serves good pancakes. However, Mat was a born reporter and
far more interested in information. The diner wasn�t full but there was a good
crowd considering the time. All men and there�s not a single waitress. You want
something; you go to the counter and order from the owner. The man Mat is
digging from is called Mike Jenkins. Mike is the son of Harry. Took over the
diner when his old man died. Like Terry, he wasn�t shy about his support for
the bill.

&nbsp;

�All I need to do is to look
at my profit. It practically triple since the bill was passed.�

�I can understand your view
from an economical standpoint, but what about the morality of the issue. Taking
the vote from women? What about your daughter, don�t you think she deserve the
vote when she�s older?�

�The women voted for it as
well. And most don�t regret their decision.�

�You sure? What about your
waitresses, you don�t think they want the vote?�

Mat didn�t know what to
expect but Mike�s laughter wasn�t it. �Considering that I have to raise their
pay twice in the last year, I don�t think you will find them complaining.�

�Really? Business is that
good?�

�Oh yes sir it is. All the
tourists need to eat somewhere right? And we have a lot of tourists these days.�
A customer walked in. Mike saw the man and greeted him. Then he turned back to
Mat.

�By the way, what are you?�
Mike asked.

�What?�

�Reporter, activist or
tourist? That�s all we have since the bill passing�

�Reporter. Why?�

�The way you spoke, I thought
you were some sort of feminist activist or something. Those guys are nothing
but trouble.�

�The town is having some problems
with feminist activists?� This was unexpected, though Mat wasn�t that surprise.
The bill must have been a lighting rod for the feminists� movement.

��Yup. You want people unhappy about the law,
look for them. Come into town, set up picket lines all over the place. They
held 3 rallies in front of Evans� house already.�

�Any arrests?�

�Can�t do that without bad
publicity. That�s what those guys want anyway. Publicity.�

�Really? Where can I find
them?� A strange idea of a story began to form in Mat�s mind.

�At Spring�s Motel across
town. Call Danny, he�ll tell you which room they�re in.�

�Danny is the owner of the
motel?�

�Yup, he can�t stand those
guys as well.�

�Why?�

�His whole family voted for
the bill. Those activists have been trying to �convert� them over since the
moment they found out. Driving him nuts.�

��������� 

With
that, Mat gave his thanks, paid the bill and went back to the motel. The case
has suddenly become interesting in another level. The town people are happy
about the law but not outsiders. The story might have just changed in the first
2 hours he had been in town. Now that�s the mark of a good story. Still, he
needs to do some more digging. He looks back at the diner and saw Mike talking
to the man who just walked in. Like most small town, it looks like everyone
knows everyone here. Without paying it anymore attention, Mat continues walking
to the motel.

&nbsp;

Inside

�How did it go?� Mike look at
John as he asked the question.

�Beautiful. You did the right
thing steering him to those activist.�

�Will it work?�

�Sure, the man is here for a
story. Can�t leave without one, so let�s give him one.�

�But I doubt this was the
story he was coming for.�

�So? It�s a good story and we
need a way to get rid of those guys. Like you told him, those activists are driving
the town nuts.�

�That bad huh?�

�Richard can handle them, but
when they go poking their noses at the townsfolk�something is bound to happen
sooner or later right?�� 

A man further down the diner
call out, �Hey John! Some service here.� 

�Hold your horses man, didn�t
Sarah cook you something today?� 

�She�s too tired from the
fucking I gave her last night, so I have eat your useless shit.�

��������� The whole diner laughed. The men of Water Springs have a
lot to be thankful for, and no nosey reporter or activists is going to get in
their way.

&nbsp;

Later

��������� She was the town lawyer. The highest paid woman in town and
seemingly the most to lose if Richard Evans continues to be mayor. So it was
with some surprise to Matthew Mansell that Zoe Cusack was actually defending
the man who should be her natural enemy.

&nbsp;

�Ms. Cusack, I�m sorry but
are you actually defending Richard Evans?�

�Defending is strong of a
word Mr. Mansell. I�m merely saying that people in Canada has made Richard Evans out to be some sort of
monster. I have spoken to him on many occasions and I can assure you that he is
no such thing. He is just a man who thought it was his civic duty to give
people a choice. It wasn�t his fault the old mayor was corrupt.�

�But to do what he did!
Taking the vote away from women. From YOU! Are you not angry with him?�

�The only people I�m angry
with are those morons in the provincial government.
If they hadn�t got involved, the bill would never have passed the second time.�

�They
were only trying to help. Trying to kill the bill.�

�They
were nothing but glory hounds. Evans offered them a re-vote. If they had agreed
at first, we would have defeated it easily. Instead they rejected the offer and
that made to town people angry. And that�s why we lost.�

�But
the vote was due to Evans. If he wasn�t there, there would be no vote.�

�Richard
Evans put the matter to a vote. It was the people who voted it into law. That�s
democracy at work.�

�The
vote causes half the people in town to be without a voice. Tell me Ms. Cusack,
why aren�t you as a smart intelligent woman angry with Richard Evans?�

Cusack
stayed silent for a moment, and said, �I have to give credit where credit is
due Mr. Mansell. Since Richard Evans came into office, Water Spring is booming.
Business is good, jobs are easy to find and even the population has increased.
The first time that happened in about 8 years. I hate to say it but the man is
doing a good job.�

�The
population has increased!� No wonder the town was bigger than he was told. But
there�s something not right about that. �Wouldn�t the population decreased
because of the bill? I mean surely the women who can go will leave.�

�Some did, but they came back
when the money came running in. With money came jobs; with jobs came even more
people. You�re not going to find too many town people against Evans, Mr.
Mansell.�

�So�you are okay without the
vote?�

�So far, it hasn�t hurt me
yet. My practice is booming as well�

�What about his other ideas? Only
men for senior positions and that women are considered property. Since women no
longer have the vote, those bills might just pass.�

�That is true. But Evans
hasn�t done anything on those ideas yet. And they will probably stay exactly
right where they are; ideas.�

�You�re willing to take the
chance.�

�Considering that I don�t
have any vote, I don�t really have a choice in the matter.�

��������� 

A
few minutes later, Mansell left the office. Zoe immediately picks up the phone
and dials HIS number. 

�Evans here. Who is this?�

�Master, the reporter has
just left. I did everything as you commanded.�

�Any problems?�

�No master, he seems unaware
of the town�s situation. You do not have to worry.�

�You are a woman!� Her master
sounded angry. �Anything you women are involved in always cause problems.�

Zoe realized her mistake.
�Yes master, I�m a stupid worthless woman. I forgot my place; please punish me
for my forgetfulness.�

�Get your ass over here
Shitface.�

�Shitface hears and obeys,
master.� 

&nbsp;

Outside

��������� Mat is not happy. How the hell is he to write a nasty story
on the town when everyone is so happy about everything? Zoe Cusack was no help.
When he found out from Terry that the town lawyer was a woman, he felt sure he
can get some dirt from her. Instead, she ended up defending the every system
she should be tearing down. Mat look at the time. 5.30pm, in a town like this, everyone would be at home. Mat
decided that it was enough for a day, time to head back to the hotel.

Later that night

�He�s working where?�

�Yup, the fucking Maple
Post.� John Clinton was not happy as he delivered the news. �Matthew Mansell
isn�t just some two-bit reporter from some local newspaper; the fucker is
working for the �Maple Post�. Its� national!�

��������� 

Richard
Evans felt a headache coming on as he digested the news. Just what he needed; trouble
with a capital T. National trouble with a capital T!

&nbsp;

�Shit man, that�s bad.� Rex
Harper, the town�s sheriff, always had a way with understatement.

�Ok, nothing we can do about
Mansell then.� Evans said. �Rex, keep an eye for trouble in the town. I don�t
want any reports of big trouble while Mansell is in town.� Evans waited for
Rex�s nod before continuing, �John, keep watching Mansell. Make sure he doesn�t
see anything we don�t want him to see.� John gave a grim nod at that. Evans
then turned to the last man in the room, Eddie Blackmore, the owner of the
town�s only newspaper. �Ed, go around town and tell everyone in the group to
lay off the womenfolk till the reporter leave town.�

�The men won�t like that
Richard. You gave them power over their women, they won�t just leave it due to
some outside reporter.� Ed doesn�t say much but when he talks, he is usually
right. Unfortunately, in this case they don�t really have a choice in the
matter.

�I don�t care,� Evans
replied. �We can�t afford national trouble at this point. Ask them how it will look
if Mansell see the womenfolk all carrying black eyes, or what will be said if
he report that all the teachers in the town�s high school are men and that they�SHIT!�

Evans looked at John who
immediately knew what he had to do. �Don�t worry; I�ll keep the man away from
the school.�

�And the camp too. No telling
what will happen if he stumbles into that.�

�Don�t worry about that
Richard. I�ll put some extra men on the road.� Rex said.

�Make sure they are men you
trust, Rex.�

�No problem, all but two of
my men are members and the camp is outside the town with only a dirt track
there. They�ll stop anything that tried to get up there.� Rex said confidently.
�����

�Sir, may this slave make a
suggestion?� Evans had almost forgotten that his slave was in the room. Zoe
�Shitface� Cusack was kneeling in a corner where she was to be as invisible as
possible, or at least that was the idea.

�Did anyone asked for your
opinion Shitface!� Evans shouted.

Shitface fall face-first to
the ground. �Forgive this useless slave, master. But this woman suggest that we
use the reporter to our advantage.�

��������� � That got the men�s
attention. The four men looked at each other for a moment, and then Evans
replied, �You will be punished for speaking out of turn�later, what is your
useless suggestion?�

&nbsp;

The next morning

��������� Spring�s Motel was without doubt a bigger motel than Bogart�s
Motel, but like Terry said, it was more popular. One look at it and Mat knew
that it was full. The feminist movement activists were all staying there, which
was kind of ironic as the owner, Danny Crawford, really can�t stand the lot of
them. 

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry Mr. Crawford. From
where I�m sitting, the feminist movement seems to be making you a rich man.�

�Who don�t like money? You
know if they want to protest, rise up some signs against Evans�I have nooo problem
with that, but these guys are insane I tell you!� 

�Why you say that, Mr.
Crawford?�

�For one they are destroying
property! They��

�Destroying property! Where?�


�Across Evan�s place. There
was a big sign congratulating him on winning the mayorship�old town tradition
you know. Those guys spray-painted �Fucking Retard� over the sign and��

�A little vandalism is hardly
destroying property, Mr. Crawford.�

�I�m getting to that! Rex,
the sheriff, gave them a warning and replaced the sign. Next thing you know the
own sign got tore down.�

That shocked Mat. No one in
town had said anything about it. �They tore it down?�

�Yeah. Looked like a truck
ran over it or something.�

�Any arrest?�
�No proof, no witness but no one else in town would have done it. Those��
Danny�s rant was cut short when Maggie Crawford came in the room. One look at
the pot and Mat knew why. Seems that he was about to witness some small town
hospitality.

�Some coffee, Mr. Mansell?�
Maggie smiled as she asked.

�No thanks. Uh�Mr. Crawford,
you mind if I asked your wife a few questions?�

�No problem. I�ll be right
outside if�� Danny was halfway up from his seat when he was stopped by his
wife�s hand.

�No need for that Dan. Mr.
Mansell can ask his questions to us together?�

�Not a problem Mrs.
Crawford.� Mat waited for Maggie to take a seat before asking. �What are your
views about losing the vote?�

�Don�t have one. Richard is
doing a good job overall�can�t really complain you know. As long as he�s doing
a good job�bringing in money, making the town boom�he�s better than our old
mayor, that�s for sure!�

�Don�t you feel any lost? Losing
the vote is a big thing, you know. Most people in Canada�in the world were screaming in disbelief when it
happened?�

�I and the rest of the women
in town don�t mind. I rather you know�the world mind their own business.
Instead of coming into town and�you know disturbing the people living here.�

�Those people are bringing in
a lot of money.�

�Sure. I have no problems
with the tourists�you know the one who just come into town, sightsee a little,
and then leaves. It�s the ones that hold protest marches, set picket lines,
destroy property�you know, I can do without those.�

Mat can�t help but smiled at
that, �You mean the mayor sign Mrs. Crawford?�

�Among others�

�What others?� This was
getting more interesting by the minute for Mat.

�Someone threw rocks at Richard
Evan�s windows and��

�Maggie,� Danny�s voice held
a warning. �Let�s not talk bad about our guests now.� Mat was surprised at
this, just 5mins ago; Danny was just laying it on for him. 

�Mr. Mansell, if you want
dirt on Evans, you are not going to get it from the townsfolk. You should go
talk to those activists upstairs.� Danny�s voice was again polite and smooth.

�I will.� Mat got up from his
seat. �Thanks for the time folks.�

Danny took Mat�s hand and
gave it a firm shake. �No problem.�

&nbsp;

��������� With that, Mat left the room and headed upstairs. The
Crawfords were seemingly a normal couple, both had to be in their 50s, but
there were some things that just weren�t right about them. Still, they weren�t
the story. Evans is�or at least he was. The activists might be an even better
one! With that though, Matthew Mansell headed up to see the local leader.

&nbsp;

Downstairs��� ��

&nbsp;

�You did well cunt�

�Thank you, master. But
master, may this old cunt asked why you stopped me just now?�

�Because you talk too much.
You were to get him interested, not give him the full story. That�ll just make
him suspicious. Stupid old cunt�

�This cunt is sorry, master.
Please punish this old cunt for her errors.� 

�Later. Now get your ass out
there and do the housekeeping.�

�Yes master. Old Cunt
understands. Old Cunt obeys.� 

&nbsp;

Maggie
�Old Cunt� Crawford stepped into the lobby of the motel. When her master first
joined the M.A.P, she wasn�t that sure it was such a good idea. Then he sent
her to the M.A.P camp outside of town. A month there and Old Cunt already knew
3 things. 

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All men are born
masters

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All women are
born slaves

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And the world is
going to change 

&nbsp;

With
a smile on her face, Old Cunt went about her duties.

��� 

&nbsp;

That night

��������� Mat hates it when the story gets away from him. However, he
loves it when a better one just show up on his doorsteps. After the talk with
the Crawfords, Mat met with the feminists. At first, they weren�t that
interested in talking, but then Mat informed them he was writing for the Maple
Post�that opened doors real fast. Like Zoe Cusack said, glory hounds! 

&nbsp;

��������� The local leader was a Jean Butterworth. She started out
confidently, answering questions in a quick fire manner. Mat started off with
the expected questions; how Richard Evans� win will affect Canada; what are the views of the feminists� movement on his
win�the normal questions. Then Mat got serious! Jean had no answers for the
destruction of the mayor sign, or the broken windows. She claimed that none of
her people did those things, and that Evans� might be trying to frame them for
those deeds. Of course, she had no evidence and none of her people were in
jail. In fact, none of her people had even spent a single night in the local
jail. Once Mat got that in, Ms. Butterworth admitted that the local police had
been exceedingly fair thus far. But once Mat got on those lines of questioning,
the interview was cut short.

&nbsp;

��������� You don�t stay in this business for 15 years without
developing some instincts, and Mat�s instincts were screaming �Fucking Good
Story� in big bold letters. Hell, even that bitch editor of his agreed. The
town against the outsiders! Now that�s a headline that will sell a lot of
newspapers. The phone rang at that point.

&nbsp;

�Yeah�

�Is this Matthew Mansell?� 

The voice on the line sounded
very familiar to Mat. Then it hit him, it�s Ed Blackmore! �Yes, Mat here. Mr.
Blackmore is it?�

�Yes. I have some good news Mat.
I spoke to Richard just now; he�s very willing to give you that interview you
want.�

�Really? That�s fast.�

�Yeah, when I told him you
came to see me, he agreed immediately.�

�Really? Uh�why?�

�Well, don�t tell him I said
this, but I think he�s kind of hoping that he will give him a fair shake.�

�Really?�

�Yeah, you know how many
reports Water Springs had so far? I can tell you that most of those hacks never
been in town, they just write those �NEWS� in their plush office in Toronto or somewhere. Most of the guys who came to town write
pieces which are more�favorable to the town.�

�Yes, I can see why. Look
like a perfectly normal small town.�

�Not the pits of hell is it?�

�Ha, ha�no.�

�10 in the morning, his
place�you know where that is?�

�Hey, I�m a reporter
remember. I�ll get there. Thanks Ed.�

�No problem�

&nbsp;

��������� The line went dead. Mat went to the local newspaper before going
over to Spring�s Motel. He wanted to know about the problems the locals were
having with the activists. Ed Blackmore was more than willing to help someone
from the Maple Post. Seems that there were a lot of��incidents� involving the
feminists, nothing proven but a lot of suspicions. Mat smiled. Oh, he just loved
the smell of a good story. 

&nbsp;

Somewhere in town

&nbsp;

�Evans here�

�Richard? Ed here, I just got
off the phone with Mansell. The meet is set. Tomorrow 10 at your place.�

�Ok Ed, good job. Rex is
ready. Your guy?�

�Sending Jake over�

�Jake? He�s not a member of
M.A.P?�

�No, but he is my best. Don�t
worry, he will get the shot.�

Richard Evans was quiet for a
moment before answering, �Ok Ed. You know your guys best. I�m counting on you.�

�Don�t worry. Jake�s the
best. You go and get some sleep, tomorrow is a big day.�
�No problem, you too�

�Goodbye�

�Bye�

&nbsp;

��������� Richard Evans put down the phone and briefly wondered what
Ed would think if he knew that Evans had no intentions of sleeping tonight. Probably
nothing good! Evans grinned as he slowly walked to his bedroom.

&nbsp;

��������� Evans smiled as he entered the room. Spread-eagled on the
bed was his naked slave, Zoe �Shitface� Cusack. Her hands and legs were tied to
the bedpost and a red ball gag was in her mouth. Evans felt a hard-on just
looking at her.

&nbsp;

�The plan is set Shitface.�
Evans said. Shitface looked at Evans and nodded her head. There was no need to
tell her anything but since she was the one who came up with the plan, Evans felt
that she should know how it was going.

&nbsp;

�It was a good plan!� Evans
said causally. �But you did speak without permission yesterday.� Evans let his
words sink in. �What do you think I should do about that slave?�

&nbsp;

��������� The answer was immediate. Shitface lifted her back and
showed Evans her raised pussy. Evans asked coyly, �You want me to fuck you?
Give you pleasure for speaking out of turn?� Shitface shook her head violently
at the thought. Evans made a show of thinking about it, �I know! You want me to
beat your pussy senseless! Is that right Shitface?� Shitface nodded her head.
�Ok�if that is what you really want.�

&nbsp;

��������� With that, Evans lifted the belt on the floor. Without
hesitation he hit her pussy with it. Shitface screamed in her gag. Evans waited
and Shitface lifted her pussy again. Another stroke hit her right on the pussy.
Shitface screamed again. Evans waited again and Shitface lifted her pussy for
the third time. Another stroke! Over and over this happen. On his travels,
Evans learned that the best way to control women was to make them want it. Make
the woman want to give up control and you would have won half the battle.
However that required patience. So Evans was patient. He waited for Shitface to
lift her pussy everytime�and then gave her the best shot he had. On the
twentieth stroke, he had enough. Shitface lift her pussy again but Evans slowly
walked over to her. He took out her ball gag and looked in her eyes.

&nbsp;

�What do you say slave?�

�Thank you master for
punishing this slave�

�Your plan was a good one. Do
you feel that you deserve the punishment?�

�Yes master. I was a slave
who spoke out of turn and without permission. That the plan was a good one does
not matter master.�

�Why?�

�Because Shitface is a slave.
All my thoughts, my ideas, my body, my pussy belonged to you master. The plan
was my thought and my thoughts belong to you master. So the plan wasn�t mine
master�it was yours.� Evans kept quiet and waited for his slave to continue.
�This slave deserved to be punished because she spoke without permission.
Please master, hit this slave again. Punish this slave for her mistakes and
train her not to repeat them again. Please master, please.� 

&nbsp;

��������� Tears pooled in his slave�s eyes as she begged for the
punishment. Gods, she was well-trained. All the extra time Evans spent on her
at the camp was paying off. Without another word, Evans put the ball gag back
in her mouth and then walked to the foot of the bed. He looked at Shitface
still raised pussy. WHACK!

A week later

��������� Evans sat down on the sofa with a smile on the face. Of
course, it�s hard not to smile while a slave was sucking your cock while you
were reading the morning papers. He looked at the men sitting in front of him.
All of them had a slave on their cocks and a smile on their face. Richard Evans
thanked them on a job well done.

&nbsp;

�Another day, another article
on the �riot� at Water Springs.� Evans said jovially as he put down the papers.

�Worked better than anything
we had planned that�s for sure.� John replied. 

�You can thank Danny Crawford
for that.� Rex said.

��������� 

��������� Again, it was an understatement from the town�s sheriff. 7
days ago, Evans met with Matthew Mansell for the interview as expected. Evans
also made sure that the feminists knew about the interview. They were out at
full force on the morning. Matthew Mansell had to fight his way past the big
picket line right in front of his house. Unknown to them, Danny had added a
little extra something in their breakfast drinks. Mansell had trouble getting
through the rowdy crowd and Evans �gallantly� came out of the house to help
him. A shouting match soon ensure between him and the activists. Before anyone
knew anything, an activist (a female activist at that) threw a punch that
caught Evans totally by surprise. He fell onto the ground and Rex and his men
went up to arrest the woman. A mini-riot ensure with Mansell right there to
report everything. If that wasn�t enough, Jake (the photographer Ed sent over
to cover the event) had great shots of Evans on the ground; Rex and his men
tussling with the activists and even a shot of a punch being thrown at one of
Rex�s officers. Mansell had the scoop of his career and the next day, the Maple
Post had �Mayor attacked by crazed feminists� as its� front-page headline. The Maple
Post flew off the shelves and other papers picked up the story. For the past 6
days, all the major papers had pushed stories of over-zealous feminists and the
various crimes they had committed in their quest for �justice�. It was bloody
brilliant. 

&nbsp;

�Actually, we should thank
Shitface here for coming up with the plan in the first place.� Evans patted the
slave on the head as he said this. Shitface looked up at her master with joy in
her eyes but never stopped sucking his cock. A well-trained slave. �Her and
that reporter Mansell.� Evans added.

�Mansell should thank us for
saving his career.� Ed said.

�Really? Why?� Evans asked.

�I�ll made a few enquires.
Seems that a lot of people considered Mathew Mansell a burnout. This story he
broke saved his career. Now they have him on a series of stories on the
feminist�s movement.��� 

�No matter what, those
feminists are gone from the town. Do we proceed?� John looked at Evans as he
asked. 

There was no doubt in Evans�
mind. �Yes, we proceed with the plan. Who�s next?�

John smiled and said, �That
would be young Terry Bogart.�

&nbsp;

2 days later

��������� Terry sat silently in the truck. His dad had refused to say
anything to him, only that he wanted Terry to take a ride with him. As the
truck went out of town, Terry thought that it was a camping trip. You know, the
final one before school restarted. However as the truck went up the mountain,
Terry knew he was wrong. There was no camp site up here. In fact, there should
be nothing up here. Then they past 2 officers from the sheriff department on
the dirt road and Terry knew he was wrong there too. He was about to asked his
dad again when he saw the gate.

&nbsp;

��������� 3 officers with guns were there at the gate but it was what
was beyond the gate that got Terry�s interest. Looking past the gate and its
surrounding wall was a camp, a big one. There shouldn�t be a camp up here. His
dad stopped at the gate and greeted the officer. They knew each other. The gate
was opened and the officer waved his dad through. Once inside the camp, Terry�s
jaw dropped.

&nbsp;

��������� A bunch of girls were doing jumping-jacks in front of a
male officer carrying a baton�and the girls were totally naked. Terry could see
their tits bouncing up and down while they were doing the jumping-jacks and
even the sweat on their shaved pussy. Terry then took a double-take. One of the
naked girls was Kate Harper, a member of the cheerleading squad. She was also
the daughter of the town�s sheriff. What the hell! Terry closed his eyes and
shook his head. No, the image is still there. He�s not dreaming! 

&nbsp;

��������� Terry looked at his dad with his mouth wide opened. His dad
had a rueful smile on his face but otherwise drove on. Terry then noticed
another squad doing exercises. This squad were all boys and all dressed. They
were doing some sort of martial arts exercise, but there was something wrong
with the picture. Then it hit him. They were guys from the town�s high
school.� There was Pete, the basketball
star; Rick, the drama club�s unofficial leader; Derrick, the geek who was the
captain of the science club; Joe, the school�s most infamous misfit. What are
these guys doing here all together?

&nbsp;

��������� �The truck stopped.
His dad got out and signaled Terry to follow. Terry got out of the truck and a
woman approached them. She was dressed and looked very familiar. Of course the
lawyer! Terry was trying to remember her name when his dad spoke.

&nbsp;

�Is your master inside
Shitface?�

�Yes sir. Master has been
waiting for you and your son in the office. Please follow me.���� With that, Shitface turned around and lead
them into the small building. 

�Uh, dad?� His dad looked at
Terry with a smile. �Did you call that woman a shitface?�

His dad patted Terry on the
back. �Come on Terry. Follow me, you will not regret this.�

&nbsp;

�Later

��������� Terry was in shock. He couldn�t believe it but his dad and
the mayor had just given him a deal no heterosexual man could possibly refuse.
There has to be a catch!

&nbsp;

�Mayor Evans, you want me to
join the M.A.P?�

�Yup�

�And in return, you will give
me a girl of my choice and make her my�slave?� Terry looked at the kneeling Zoe
Cusack.

Evans noticed the look Terry
gave the slave. �Shitface, give young Terry here a blowjob.�

&nbsp;

��������� Shitface immediately crawled over to Terry before Terry
could even say a word. Once Terry felt his cock in the slave�s mouth, all
thoughts flew from his mind. A teenager receiving a blow from a lawyer. Terry
looked at the mayor who just smiled back at him.

&nbsp;

�There are certain advantages
in being a member.� The mayor said.

�Why me? I mean you have all
those guys out there. Why do you want me to be a member?�� 

�You saw those guys already
Terry. Tell me, what do you noticed about them?�

Terry thought about it for a
moment (not easy considering the circumstances). Those guys have but one thing
in common. �They are all leaders!� he exclaimed. �They are all leaders of their
cliques in school.� 

�That�s right boy. The M.A.P is
going to change the school system in the coming year but to make sure it�s
going to be a success, we are going to need leaders in place that agreed with
our�thinking.�

�But I�m no leader. Hell, I
don�t even belong to any cliques.�

�Oh but you do Terry. In
every school, there will always be a bunch of guys who do not fit in. Loners if
you will. According to Ron Guinn, you know all of them and you are very
well-liked for a loner.�

�Principle Ron?�

�Yes, Ron is member of M.A.P
too.�

&nbsp;

At
that moment, Terry suddenly felt the pressure. It was like a tidal wave that
crashed and swept all before it. He couldn�t hold it and cummed. Shitface swallowed
every drop of his seed and then smiled as she started to lick his cock clean.
Terry looked at the mayor in embarrassment.

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry,� Evans assured
him. �With practice, you will be able to hold it much longer.�

His dad decided to come in
now. �So what do you think Terry? You in?�

Terry looked at his dad and
the mayor. �Are you kidding me? What do I have to do?�

&nbsp;

A few weeks later 

��������� Terry sat down in class and waited for the teacher to come.
It was the first day of school and the shit was about to hit the fan. Terry
couldn�t wait for it to happen.

&nbsp;

��������� He didn�t have to wait long. Mr. Baker walked into the
class carrying a big pile of books. The class quieted down. 

&nbsp;

�Hello everyone. Nice to see
you all again. As all of you know, there are some changes for the coming year.
First off, there will be a buddy system. All of you will be partner up with
another classmate. A boy with a girl. That partner will be your buddy for the
rest of the year. However as there are more girls than boys in school, some of
you lucky bastards will have 2 girls as your buddies instead of one.� Giggles
and soft laughter came from the class. Mr. Baker ignored them and continued,
�Most of you will also notice that there was riot in town recently.� There was
no laughter at that. �To ensure that discipline is maintained, in the buddy
system, the guy will be in charge. That means that the girl will do whatever
the male buddy says.� The girls in class looked on in horror; a few of them
looked ready to explode. Mr. Baker continued, �However because they are in
charge, this also means that if the girl got into the trouble, like say she got
detention, the male will also shared in the punishment.� 

The
guys exploded, �Unfair�; �That�s ridiculous�; �Are you nuts?� were just some of
the shouts. 

&nbsp;

��������� Mr. Baker waited for the shouts to calm down before
continuing, �Like I said earlier, the guy is in charge. You will in short be
helping the school look after the discipline of the female students. As such,
if the male student failed in his duty, he must accept the punishment.� �

�What if she breaks the rules
while I�m not around? How can I be responsible for that?� Someone shouted.

�You guys will not have to
leave the girl alone while in school. In fact, anyone of the school staff could
at any time asked anyone of you where your partner is; if you are unable to
give a good answer, then both of you will get detention.�

That is the opening for Terry
to ask his question, �What if I want to go east and the girl wants to go west?
How can I stop her?�

Mr. Baker followed the script
and answered, �That is up to the guy. Like I said, the guy is in charge.� 

�So what? I can slap her
around if she refused to listen?� Terry said with a laugh. 

�Like I said before, �that is
up to the guy�.� A stunned silence followed Mr. Baker�s words. The M.A.P
weren�t stupid. They knew that at least some of the girls would object. To show
them what could happen if they did, the party placed a girl in every class as a
showcase. In this class it was Mary-Jean Wolf. 

Mary-Jean stood up and
screamed, �That�s bullshit! You can�t do that and the school can�t either. I
will have my dad string you up for charges if you do!� Mary-Jean was putting up
a convincing performance. 

�Sit down Wolf.� Mr. Baker
said.

�What if I don�t? You are
going to hit me?�

�No but if you continued in
this, you will get into trouble and so will your buddy who is�Terry Bogart.�
Mr. Baker said as he pretended to look at his files.

That�s his cue. �What? I
didn�t know she is my partner?� Terry shouted.�


�Now you do.� Mr. Baker said.

�So what?� Mary-Jean said.
�You are crazy if you think I will take orders from this idiot. You and the
rest of the stupid school board!�

�Report for detention today
Ms. Wolf.� Mr. Baker then turned to Terry. �You will join her there.�

�What?� Terry stood up as he
shouted.

�Mary-Jean wasn�t finished. �You can�t do this!
I��

�Shut up bitch!� Terry
shouted at Mary-Jean. You can hear a pin drop in the silence that followed.

Mary-Jean looked at Terry in
shock. Terry looked at her and couldn�t help but think what a good actress she
was. Finally, Mary-Jean looked to Mr. Baker and said in a shaky voice, �He�he
just call me a bitch. You can�t��

�And you deserved it.� Mr.
Baker said. You can hear the collective intake of air from the class. �You will
be in detention today Ms. Wolf and due to your action, so will your buddy. If I
was him, I will call you a bitch as well.�

&nbsp;

��������� With that statement, the wind was taken out of the sails
for the rest of the girls. Terry looked at Mary-Jean and they shared a secret
smile together. It will take a while but everyone could feel it already. Some
things are about to change.

&nbsp;

The next day

��������� Richard Evans, Rex Harper, John Clinton and Eddie Blackmore
sat and shared a celebratory drink in Evans� office. The first day of school
has passed and so far everything had gone as well as they can be expected to.
Some parents had complained of course but nothing too serious. Most are willing
to give the new �system� a shot. As time went by, the men know that the boys
will grow into their new roles (and some of the girls too). Soon it will be too
entrench for anyone to change.

&nbsp;

��������� Evans has also taken court action against the various
feminist groups that were involved in the riot. Shitface will be his lawyer in
the case. With the publicity right now, the chances of him losing was between
slim to none. Evans and Shitface will clean them out for millions. This will
hurt those feminist groups and Evans will then channel those millions into the
M.A.P. Already there are men from other towns and cities asking for membership.
With these millions, the M.A.P will be more than a local party. Evans will make
it a party that will have a presence in every city and province in Canada. The men smiled. Yes, they can feel it in the air.
Some things are about to change.

&nbsp;

THE END�for now?

Yes, as anyone will know from
reading it, this story was much longer in length when I first plotted it. I
admit; I lost interest in it halfway. Maybe I�ll go back to M.A.P in the
further but now�thanks for reading.
