The Rise of the
Ponygirl Transport System in the World

By Sarah

&nbsp;

The following is a
story based on predictions of global oil producers and what a loss in oil would
mean to the future of transportation in the world.� It is not the only solution, but it could be one possible scenario.� This is still just a work of fiction, but it would
be interesting to see if it comes to pass.

&nbsp;

Prologue

&nbsp;

����������� Scientists
and world leaders are facing a crisis.�
Within the next 40-50 years, all predictions seem to indicate that world
oil supplies will drop dramatically.�
World governments could wind up going to war over oil, and even if they
do, the supplies would only last a few years afterwards.� How then, would the world�s population
commute?� A simple and cost effective
system of Ponygirls and Ponyboys being used to move people around, of course
distances traveled would be less then they currently are.��� What follows is a short story, base don the
observations of Kristy, a 21 year old female in Orlando, FL
about to become a ponygirl after failing to find work.

&nbsp;

Chapter 1 � Life in a
ponygirl world

&nbsp;


 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 

 
 
����������� Kristy was nervous.� Today was her final day to find a job, before
she was automatically designated to become a ponygirl.� When the world supplies of oil dropped below
50% ten years ago, the United
  States instituted the Emergency Oil
Preservation rules, along with all the other countries in the world.� It was required that upon completion of
school, all people had 60 days to secure a job thru the government�s job
centers, or be reclassified as livestock.�
The designation change was necessary to help prevent waste of fuel and
to help curb pollution.� Within hours of
the law being passed, army and local police units were on the streets, taking
those who did not have a legal job off to the training facilities to learn how
to become human ponies.� Some people fled
from the country, but soon, these learned that although their status had
changed, they still had the best protections in the world.� Unfortunately for them, they could not return
once they fled.

&nbsp;

Within a week, prostitution, STDs, HIV, and a host of other
city problems had disappeared, thanks to the medical advances offered to the
new ponies.� Jobs had been created to
help with the upkeep and maintenance of the human pony herd, and the quality of
life started to increase across the country.�
.� Teams of Ponyboys were used to
pull the heavy mass transit systems and large delivery carts, while ponygirls
were being used for family transportation and taxi services. 

&nbsp;

In all, life was getting
better.� Kids were educated at the local
schools, and those who wanted to go on to college could do so, while those who
had job offers could take them.�
Volunteers were always accepted into the pony community, and instead of
the drafted ponies, these could actually earn a wage and be offered a job
during interviews setup with potential employers.� 

&nbsp;

����������� As Kristy
marveled at the world now, she was reminded that time was running.� Still, she had to weigh her options.� On one hand, there was the possibility that
the employment agent working her case would be able to place her, but as the
hours passed, she grew less hopeful.�
Finally, with only one hour left before her classification was
officially changed, she walked down to the local job center, and volunteered
for ponygirl service. 

&nbsp;

Chapter 2 � Dressing
out

&nbsp;

����������� Kristy
stood at the back of the job center, waiting for the transport to take her to
the ponygirl training facility outside of Orlando.� She and about 10 other girls and 5 boys were
waiting in the volunteers� area, while trucks of converted humans were waiting
in holding bays to be taken as well.�
Kristy talked with a few of the girls around her, and most volunteered
because they were in the same boat.� Some
of the boys, predictably, thought they would be able to have some fun with the
fillies, but the colts were destined for a different facility, and would not be
housed together.

&nbsp;

����������� As the
trucks arrived for the volunteers, the small group was split up, girls on one
truck, boys on the other.� Larger capacity
trucks were brought in for the rest of the waiting people, again, splitting
them up with boys on one truck, girls on the other.� As the trucks left, Kristy could see the
police units leaving the job center, ready to go collect the unfortunates.� Kristy smiled to herself, thinking she had at
least made a good choice.

&nbsp;

����������� The trucks
carrying the girls left the city proper, and within a half hour, they came into
sight of a large corral and training facility.�
The trucks entered the compound, and came to a stop, and then workers
approached each of the trucks, and began to unload the girls.� The volunteers were taken out first, and led
to a room, where they were ordered to undress, and then to prepare to be ringed
and chipped, so they could be identified as volunteers.� 

&nbsp;

Kristy and the rest were a little
nervous at first, but after a brief pause, she began undressing.� Soon, all the girls in the volunteer group
were nude, and they were passed on to a trainer, who had the group enter a
white room.� A bright flash followed, and
then the lighting returned to normal.�
Kristy wondered what had happened, till she looked down at her
body.� All her hair had been removed,
from every part of her.� The girls were a
little nervous about this, but the dressing out had only just begun.� The trainer led the girls to the marking
room, where each girl had a small chip implanted into their right forearm.� It hurt a little, but the girls all knew the
chip would be keeping their credits and also their personnel information, so they
figured it was worth the small pain.� The
group then followed the trainer to the harness room, where each girl was fitted
for a leather harness, bridle, tail, and hoof boots and mitts. 

&nbsp;

The harness had 2 leather straps
that went over the shoulders, and connected to a ring, just below the
breasts.� There was a strap that ran
under the breasts, with little half cups to hold and separate the breasts, as
well as a small strap that ran over the breasts and connected with the shoulder
straps, to act like a bra.� Below the
breast strap, the central leather ran to a second ring located at the belly of
each girl, where other straps met.� One
was a waist belt strap, to allow carts to be harnessed to the girls.� There was a crotch strap, which had a dildo
and anal plug on it, which passed between the girl�s legs, and a set of
suspender straps for stockings that would be worn under the pony hoof boots. 

&nbsp;

As Kristy was closest, the trainer
harnessed her first.� She giggled a
little, when she first saw the harness, and then gave a muted gasp of pleasure
as the dildo was inserted, then a small squeal as the anal plug was likewise
inserted.� As the straps were fastened
down, Kristy was told to put on the white stockings, signifying her trainee
status.� Once the stockings were on,
Kristy put on the hoof boots, and the trainer laced them up tight, making them
one with her foot.� Kristy teetered on
them for a minute, and then she settled down.�
To her, it was like wearing a pair of 5 inch heels.� 

&nbsp;

The trainer next began to fasten
the elaborate head harness about Kristy�s head.�
There were straps that went below her chin, around her head, and one
over her head.� All these were tightened
down, made snug, then the final bit of gear was added, the bit.� The ponygirl bit, by design, kept the pony
muted, but protected her teeth. The bit was leather with a small metal curb
which rested on the tongue, preventing speech, but allowing the girl to make
pony sounds.� Finally, the trainer
connected a set of reigns to the bit, and tied Kristy to a hitching rail, to
wait for the rest of the volunteer girls to be prepped.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 3 � Training

&nbsp;

Kristy stood at the hitching rail
for nearly 2 hours, as the other girls were similarly harnessed.� She admired the other girls and thought about
what her new life was going to be like.�
When all the girls had been harnessed up completely, the trainer came to
the hitching rail, and untied the rest of the girls, taking their reigns and
leading them to the initiation room.�
Kristy and the rest were led into a separate building, where each was
hitched onto their own platform.� Kristy
was a little nervous, but as the lights dimmed, she saw a movie come on, so she
settled in to watch it.� 

&nbsp;

����������� The movie
was all about how to be a proper ponygirl, and covered everything from reign
signals to proper posture.� Kristy was
surprised when during the movie the subject being taught was actually
demonstrated to her live.� The other
girls all experienced the same things that were happening on the movie.� The final bit was a surprise, however.� The screen showed a dirt road, and the girls
heard the movie command them to prepare for a run.� They felt the booths begin to move, and soon,
each girl felt like they were hitched to a cart.� The drivers flicked the reigns, and the girls
obediently began to march step.� The
screen showed the path moving, and the girls felt the tugs on the reigns as the
road twisted and turned.� This lasted for
over an hour, and by the end, each girl had become exhausted.� 

&nbsp;

����������� As the trainer
took Kristy out of the booth, he reported to her that for her fist time, she
was a natural, and seemed to be ready to move on to real life driving training,
then she would be ready to be sold.�
Kristy was surprised, but eager to move on.

&nbsp;

����������� As the weeks
passed, Kristy continued to impress the training staff, and soon, she had
offered from buyers to purchase her for their use as their exclusive
ponygirl.� Kristy was happy.� The money being offered was more than enough
for her to return to graduate school, and even to begin her own business
selling some sex toys and ponygirl training tips for volunteers and play
ponies.� Finally, however, came the day
of the sale.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 4 � Sold

&nbsp;

����������� Kristy was
taken back to the harnessing room, and dressed out in all the finest as she
waited for the sale to begin.� She sat
there feeling the trainer fix a feather plume to her head harness, then giggled
a little as he rubber her down with some tanning
lotion, and finally added some glitter to her skin.� Kristy was loving the
attention the trainer was showing her, and she was pleased she was taking her
time with this soon to be sold pony.�
Kristy didn�t know it, but the trainer was fixing on buying her, if she
could afford the highly sought after filly.

&nbsp;

����������� Finally,
the time came for the sale, and Kristy was led, along with about 30 other
ponies, to the sale blocks.� The
volunteers were kept till the end, so that the individual families could
purchase them, while the taxi services bid on the converted ponygirls.� The converted ponies were bought in groups of
ten, and while all the ponies were highly trained, the converted ponies hadn�t
been as pampered as the volunteer ponies, and also they knew there was no
return possible for them to the human world, unless they were freed by the
discovery of some extremely vast supply of oil.�


&nbsp;

����������� As the taxi
ponies were sold, they were taken away by the buyer�s pony powered trucks, to
begin their service as taxis and shuttles around the local areas.� After the business buyers had bought what they
wanted and left, the volunteer ponies were brought up on stage, to be auctioned
off to the remaining bidders.� Kristy was
slated to be the last one, since she was the most likely to draw in the bucks.� Each of the ponies would receive the final
bid price, minus the cost of harness and such, which still left most of the
money to the ponies.� The lowest bid
allowed had to give the pony $4,000.00 so when she opted out, she could have
something to start out on, although the opt-out wouldn�t be offered till the
ponygirl had served for over 5 years.

&nbsp;

����������� Kristy
heard the bids, and as the amounts kept going up, her eyes budged.� She knew ponygirls were highly sought after,
but some of the final prices were in the millions.� Kristy�s turn finally came, and she was led
on the block.� The auction started at the
traditional $4,000.00 mark, and very quickly had climbed to over
$500,000.00.� Kristy couldn�t believe
it.� The bids still kept coming, but
finally, the gavel banged down, and Kristy was sold, for $1.3 million dollars.� As she was taken by her new owner to her
horse trailer, Kristy couldn�t help but smile behind her bit.

&nbsp;

Chapter 5 � Life as a
family ponygirl

&nbsp;

����������� Kristy�s
new owner took the newly acquired ponygirl back to the house and unpacked
Kristy from the horse trailer, to place her in her new home.� Kristy looked around the stall, and was
suitably impressed.� There was fresh
straw on the floor, a huge window she could look out of, and even a working
indoor toilet.� Kristy turned and beamed
at her owner, then like a good pony, she knelt down, to receive her new pony
name. 


 
 
Kristy�s
owner looked on with pride, as Kristy knelt there on the straw, looking like
the proudest pony in the city.� Sandra
and Ken Michel, great grandson of Tom Michel who penned the first ponygirl
laws, looked at the sun shining on Kristy�s body, and then gave her the pony
name, Sunshine Glory.

&nbsp;

����������� Sunshine
Glory smiled behind her bit, and couldn�t help but feel glad she was being
offered this chance at a possible future.�
Sandra and Ken then sat down with Kristy, at a small card table, to
discuss how long she would like to remain with them.� Ken removed her bit for the discussion, and
Kristy felt obliged to tell them how proud she was that they had bought her,
especially after all Sandra had done during her training to help her.� Kristy told them that she would like the
opportunity to begin her own small ponygirl business, and both Ken and Sandra
said they could help Kristy do this, if she would agree to serve them as their
exclusive pony for 5 years as nothing but pony, and for a further 10 years and
part time pony, with the option to return as a full time pony if the store
didn�t make it, or if Kristy wanted to return on her own.� Kristy agreed, and signed on the line,
signing both her legal name and her new Pony name.� 

&nbsp;

����������� So life
began anew for Kristy, a.k.a Sunshine Glory.�
During the day, she would take Sandra and Ken to their jobs, dropping
Sandra ff at the training grounds then continuing on to Ken�s office, where he
worked to make the lives of ponygirls safer, as well as to help promote the
idea of ponygirl powered transportation.��
While they were at work, Sunshine Glory was hitched to a rail in the
building�s ponygirl parking lot, where she watched the comings and goings of
the other pony teams, learning from observation what equipment owners wanted
for their ponies. 

&nbsp;

Epilogue

&nbsp;

����������� After her
five years as a full time pony, Kristy began her ponygirl outfitters store,
with the help of Ken and Sandra, and soon, she had a nice business going. �Drivers would come in, and buy all sorts of
things, from plumes to crops to fancy harnesses to new hoof boots.� Kristy sometimes missed the life of a
ponygirl, but she thought fondly of the weekends when she still donned her pony
harness and became Sunshine Glory for the Michels�.� 

&nbsp;

After her store had been up and
running for over 20 years, Kristy had enough money to go buy herself her own
pony, which she did, and soon both she and the Michels� were driving their
proud fillies around the town.� 

&nbsp;

The world continued to get better,
and soon, the big oil guzzling cars were things of the past.� Hover technology soon replaced the airplane
as the principle long range transportation devices, and instead of every home
with a garage, it soon became every home with a stable.� Hover technology also made huge teams of
ponies unnecessary, thereby allowing more families to afford ponies.� Soon, volunteers were so prolific, that
forced recruiting was not necessary, although the laws were not changed just to
help control the unemployment figures. 

&nbsp;

Volunteers were still allowed to
keep funds they generated, but the auction prices soon dropped back to sensible
levels.� There were no longer the Million
Dollar ponies being sold at auctions.�
The typical price of a pony now was about $15,000.00 for a five year
commitment.� Ponies could offer
themselves for longer, once the bidding was done, and the owners could renew
the contract at the amount paid at auction, adjusted for inflation.� The end result was that about 30 years after
the world ran out of oil, there was no need to go looking for more, since now,
any family that wanted, could afford a ponygirl or ponyboy for their personal
transportation.
