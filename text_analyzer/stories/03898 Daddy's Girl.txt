Synopsis: Two girlfriends catch up over a couple of bottles of champagne. Nikki starts to tell Sam about her new life with the man she calls 'Daddy'. A gentle introduction - other adventures may lie ahead.Daddy's girl 
1. Nikki and Samantha 
�Wow � omigosh �,� said Samantha, �your apartment is just amazing.� 
�Amazing,� Samantha said again, through the open doorway of the bathroom tiled
  from floor to ceiling in unpolished dove-grey marble. 
�My god, Nikki,� as she bounced on the enormous bed clothed in slinky grey
  silk sheets and covers, amongst Nikki's menagerie of stuffed toys and teddy
  bears. �This is just an incredible place. And that view � wow. I love it. I
  love all your stuff.� The furniture, the voluptuous marble sculptures, the
  paintings and the sexy black and white photos on the walls � close ups that
  morphed between flower forms and intimate anatomy. The clothes and shoes filling
  the walk-in wardrobe, the good taste � and behind it, the money � on display
  everywhere. 
Nikki, kicking off her kitten-heels and stretching out on the massive white
  corner sofa in the living room, simply grinned. �What can I say babe, Daddy
  is good to me.� 
�This Daddy �,� Samantha shook her head, �� well, I don't know. All I can
  say is � when can I meet him?� 
�Soon. Soon, if you like. Just so long as you behave yourself �� 
Nikki shut her eyes for a minute, sinking back on the luscious white sofa.
  Daddy really was good to her. And what Daddy wouldn't love his Nikky? Look
  at her � those long, sleek, but full, soft limbs � bare tanned legs and arms.
  The black linen summer dress bunching up on the swells of her thighs against
  the sofa. Full breasts stretching the cloth. Her nearly black hair, cut just
  above shoulder height, strands of which she's brushing away from her long laughing
  mouth with a manicured fingernail. Mischeivious hazel eyes, now hiding behind
  dark-dusted lids like moth wings. Pointed little cat tongue flashing over her
  teeth as the lips curl back for an instant. Then she composes her mouth again,
  wriggles her back more comfortably into the sofa, and her nose twitches. 
The sofa bounces under her, startling her eyes open, as Samantha flings herself
  down beside her. They hug for a moment. 
�It's just so exciting � I mean, isn't it? You living here � I mean, our Nikki
  a kept woman! It's so � decadent, isn't it. Brilliant. And d ? 'you know what �� 
Samantha wrinkles up her freckled face, pushes the blonde hair back behind
  her ears, and puts on a highly serious TV guru expression � �you know what,
  Nikki, you deserve it girl. After some of those stupid, low-life boyfriends
  you've had, it's about time you found a man who can make you happy. And if
  it just has to be a rich older man who sets you up in a beau-ti-ful apartment,
  buys you tonnes of clothes and presents - and oodles of sexy lingerie - well,
  what can you do?� 
�Oh, Sam, thank you. I'm really glad you're happy for me.� 
All languor gone, Nikki springs up from the sofa. Stands in front of her friend,
  hands on hips, smiling as ever, �right then, time for champagne? I think so.� 
The two girls were on the second bottle. The stereo was on loud. Sam had pulled
  out most of Nikki's lingerie wardrobe and modeled, holding the outfits against
  her clothes, all pouting mouth and mussed hair, sticking her tongue through
  crotchless lace panties, swaggering her chest out into expensive silk bras.
  Basques, camisoles, and Daddy's favourite little pussy-winking babydolls. 
Panties, bras, nighties and garter-belts were strewn everywhere. Two champagne
  flutes, half a bottle and another empty rolling on its side against cast-off
  pumps. Olive stones and lipstick-smeared gold-tipped cigarette butts piling
  up in a cut glass ashtray on the mosaic coffee table. Two girls collapsing
  on the white sofa in fits of giggles. 
Samantha lay on her belly, head propped on her knuckles with her elbows into
  a cushion, lying along one wing of the sofa. Outside, the breezy summer afternoon
  was turning into a vivid blue dusk. The big wraparound windows poured in golden
  evening light. Inside, Samantha was putting on her serious-pouty expression
  again, and looking fixedly at her friend. 
�Nikki, your Daddy � does he really spank your bottom?� 
Nikki giggled. Hid her face in a cushion. Then sat up and looked back into
  Samantha's face. Stubbed out her cigarette with great care. Bit her lip. �Ye-es.
  It's true. My Daddy spanks my botty. But only when I'm a naughty girl.� 
The last came out in a husky whisper. They both giggled. A tension giggle. 
Nikki refilled the glasses. �Seriously, Samantha. Yes, Daddy does spank me.
  That's part of our relationship. It's something we agreed on, and I accept.� 
She stopped for a minute, sipping thirstily at her champagne. 
�Go on,� prompted Sam. 
�Okay. Well, yes, I have to admit I didn't know what to make of it at first.
  You remember when I first started seeing Daddy, you remember we called him
  my �mysterious gentleman'. And that's what he was, just this incredible gentleman,
  like something out of some kind of movie. Taking me out to these fancy restaurants,
  then sending me home after in a taxi, with just this gentle, warm kiss lingering
  on my lips. Then sending flowers round to the boutique the next day. I didn't
  really know what to make of it. Obviously he was this smart, older guy, obviously
  with plenty of money, and he said that he enjoyed my company and he liked to
  see me enjoying myself. All very nice, it made me feel pretty good to be treated
  like some kind of lady for a change. And obviously I knew he was going to want
  something more out of it, but I was just enjoying seeing how it was going to
  go. He made all the moves, like he was in control of the situation from the
  beginning. I didn't even know his phone number, or anything about him really � to
  be honest, there's still a lot I don't know about what my Daddy gets up to,
  but that's another story. But so far everything he did was just right � am
  I explaining myself? It was all a bit mysterious, just waiting to see what
  he'd surprise me with next, but I was enjoying the ride. 
�Then one day he called, he asked me to meet him in this hotel bar, the bar
  at Les Ambassadeurs  no less. It was all this dark leather and shady
  corners, chinese screens. Like the men in Saville Row suits talking in hushed
  voices behind the screen next door were probably selling oil fields or nuclear
  warheads, or arranging who was going to be the next president of Zaire or somewhere.
  And there in one of these shady corners was me and Daddy, I was sipping a champagne
  cocktail and he was drinking some incredibly expensive brandy, and he looked
  all businesslike and serious and said there was something serious he wanted
  to talk about with me. He said, how much he had enjoyed the time we had spent
  together, and how he had grown to like me and take an interest in my life,
  and he believed that I was an imaginative and open-minded young woman, and
  he hoped I understood how much he respected me and all this, and so would consider
  his proposition in a spirit of mutual respect and trust. His proposition, that's
  what he said. And he smiled at me, and I felt scared, and ready to be shocked,
  but at the same time I felt I could just melt into his big dark eyes. I nodded,
  and touched his hand. He explained that he had been looking for a long time
  for someone special, and he hoped I might be the one. What he would ask from
  me might seem unconventional, and it might seem to be asking a lot. He said
  that the relationship he offered would require from me a great deal of trust
  and commitment, and that most girls wouldn't be comfortable with what he was
  asking. Perhaps I wouldn't be, in which case, he said, he hoped we could part
  with fond memories of the short time we had spent together. But perhaps, he
  thought, he might offer me something more. 
�So he explained that he had what he called unconventional sexual or romantic
  tastes. In a relationship he likes to take a dominating role. He said that
  he isn't a sadist, he doesn't enjoy causing pain. He takes pleasure in receiving
  obedience and sexual submission from a beautiful woman. But there can be two
  sides to that role. On the one hand he wants to nurture, protect and give pleasure.
  Of course, he'll support me in style, treat me like a queen, I'll never want
  for anything and all that. But, he said, perhaps a little immodestly he thinks
  he can give me rich and fascinating experiences on more than just the material
  level. But then, on the other hand, I have to know that he can be very demanding.
  He will demand that, within the limits we set on the relationship, I will put
  him before anything else, and work hard to make him happy. And he will demand
  my obedience. That means that I accept his say on something even when I disagree
  or maybe feel uncomfortable with what he's asking. And, if he believes it is
  necessary, he will use physical punishment to reinforce obedience. 
�That was exactly how he said it. In the bar in Les Ambassadeurs, in
  this quiet shady little corner. Sitting across the table looking directly into
  my eyes. After he'd finished, we just sat there looking at each other for a
  few moments. I didn't know what to think, what to say. Part of me thought I
  should just walk out of there, I don't know. But, you know, I just sat there
  staring into his eyes. 
�He smiled. He said, yes it was a lot to think about. Yes, it was a lot to
  take on all at once, but he had found it was best to be open about these things
  from the start. If I wanted to, he would take me on a journey towards a distant
  horizon, he would be my guide. But I needed to come with my eyes open from
  the beginning. He said he would be there, in the same place, at the same time
  three days later. That is where it would begin, if I chose. Then he stood up,
  bent over and kissed me on the lips as I looked up at him, still pretty much
  in a daze, and he left. 
�Three days later, I was there again. I came into the bar, I was five minutes
  late. The waiter showed me to the same seat, then he brought me a champagne
  cocktail, before I even had a chance to order anything. Daddy wasn't there
  yet, in fact the bastard made me wait another ten minutes fidgeting in the
  chair. Then he came in. He didn't sit down, he just stood next to me, smiled,
  and held his hand out to me for me to stand up. I was scared, my heart was
  really thumping. I wanted him to just hold me really tight, he put his arm
  round me, kissed me. Then we went upstairs, he had booked a suite. It was really
  beautiful, so much light through the windows, views of the park, and the room
  was just full of flowers. We just talked a lot at first, I was really nervous,
  at least until I got quite tipsy on champagne. And we kissed, Daddy stroked
  my hair. I felt like a little girl already - that's what he does to me Sam.
  He had brought me this diamond bracelet - it must be worth absolutely thousands.
  I just kept holding it up in the light from the window, watching it sparkle
  so much, like there were all little fires in each of the stones.� 
Nikki stopped. She drank down the rest of her glass, and looked hard at Sam. �Gosh.
  I'm rambling on, Sam. I'm sorry � I don't know what it must all seem like to
  you, and I'm not sure I really know how to explain � I mean �� 
They smiled at each other. Sam said, �so far it sounds, well, really romantic
  Nikki. Actually, incredibly romantic. If a bit weird, it's true. But � well,
  you haven't said �� 
Nikki laughed loud. �I haven't said anything about the spanking? Is that what
  you really want to hear about Sammy? It is, isn't it. I'm sorry, enough diamonds
  and flowers and kisses, let's get down to it. Okay.� 
She was lighting another cigarette. Smoked, cleared her throat, composed herself. �Okay,
  the truth. The truth is I'm a shameless hussy and actually I rather like it.
  Well, let me qualify that. There's spanking, and then there's when it's rather
  more serious, and that can be something else. But for the most part � 
�Well, the truth is, sometimes I think Daddy might have guessed I already
  had a weakness for a few love pats, even a little bit of bondage. Maybe it's
  just my imagination, but I think he might have known I wouldn't be too shocked
  by the idea. You remember my ex-boyfriend Chris? Sometimes we used to play
  spanking games, Chris used to tie my wrists behind my back, then he'd put me
  over his knee and give me a bit of a spanking. You know, pretty light stuff,
  I was a naughty chambermaid or something - � oh please master Chris, please
  sir, I promise I'll be a good girl in future. ' He never smacked me very
  hard, and then after a few smacks he'd stop and tickle in between my legs � well,
  that used to get me very hot, my dear, and then the naughty chambermaid would
  get a jolly old rogering. But it was only a bit of fun, we both had to be in
  the mood for it. I certainly wouldn't have let him try anything like that if
  I wasn't up for it already. 
�But of course with Daddy it's different. He doesn't spank me just for fun � or
  not usually, and then it's just a few pats. And when he spanks me he usually
  takes it quite seriously � or at least he makes out as if he does. And sometimes
  I'm not in the mood for it at all, in fact often I'm all indignant and I'm
  not happy about it at all, but I have to go through with it because that's
  part of the whole thing. And at first I thought I might resent it. And sometimes
  maybe I still do. But the more I'm with Daddy, the more � it's like I understand
  it more. So now at first I might kick up, throw a fit, but then he takes control
  and soon, somehow without me knowing it, I don't want to fight him any more.
  I just feel like I'm happy he's taken control, I can kind of let go of all
  of it � it sounds stupid, but it's almost like I'm grateful to him for punishing
  me. And then I get that tingling inside � well sometimes it's enough to make
  you want to be a naughty girl, just to feel that tingle inside when you're
  lying over Daddy's knee �� 
Nikki stopped. She looked at Sam, who was lying with her head on her knuckles
  staring wide-eyed up at her. Nikki took a drag and exhaled aloud. 
�So, Sam, d ? 'you think I've gone mad? Or what?� 
�No, no. I didn't say that Nikki. I mean, whatever turns you on sweetheart �� 
�Yes, okay, I get turned on from being spanked over my Daddy's knee. Actually,
  yes, fuck yes, I get seriously turned on from it. I get all wet when I'm getting
  my spanking. Okay?� 
Nikki put on a fierce face that turned into another stream of giggles, giggling
  right into her champagne glass. 
�So,� said Samantha, �so what do you do to be a naughty girl then?� 
�To be a naughty girl?� Nikki put the cigarette out. �Well, Daddy doesn't
  like me smoking for one thing. I mean, if Daddy had walked in just now and
  found me smoking, well I'd have a red bottom tonight.� 
�So aren't you worried he'll smell all the smoke in here if he comes tonight?� 
�No. Because I'll just blame it all on you Sam.� 
�And then I'll get a red bottom �� 
Nikki laughed. �Well, maybe, if that's what you want Sam �� 
Sam was blushing. She quickly tried to cover it up. �What else? What else
  doesn't Daddy like?� 
�Well � basically, Daddy wants me to act like a lady. To have good manners,
  always be polite, and kind, and that means showing that I value our time together,
  not sulking or being petulant or unappreciative. Always remembering what a
  lucky young lady I am, and keeping a happy face, and trying to brighten the
  day for everyone I meet � not bringing people down or making people worry.
  Not letting myself down either, and that means paying attention when Daddy
  is teaching me something, because I'm a clever girl, only sometimes I can be
  arrogant and think I know more than I do, and I have to watch out for that.
  So basically, always try to be good, and � well, and always dress nicely, pay
  attention to my appearance, depilate, exfoliate, manicure, always be on time,
  keep the flat clean � Daddy pays for a cleaning lady but that doesn't mean
  I should let the place turn into a tip in the meantime, smile and say please
  and thank-you, that kind of thing. Do all that, and my arse is safe. Be late
  one time, or get in a rush so my hair's a mess or my makeup's not done properly,
  and I know I'll be over his knee when we get home that night. And, even though
  I might not think so at the time, the truth is that after he's made my bottom
  all red I'll be horny as hell, and so will he and I'll definitely get a good
  seeing too.� 
Sam said � �so, then, I mean, you like it really � it's not really a punishment
  at all is it? So you're not really going to be any less of a brat, are you?� 
Nikki was quiet for a moment, thinking. Then she said, �no, I think I have
  changed quite a bit. I don't know if it's because of the spanking as such,
  maybe it's more that I respect Daddy, and I find � god what am I saying � but
  that's how it is � I respect him, and I find that I want to please him, I want
  to be good for him. Yeah sometimes I might act like a bit of brat to get over
  his knee, it's true, but that's only a bit of a game then. On the whole, I
  think I do try to act like a lady for him.� 
She paused. Drank another sip. �And then, there's some times when it's more
  than just a little bit of a spanking � I mean, being a few minutes late or
  not fixing my make-up properly, that's one thing. Daddy knows I'm like that
  sometimes, sometimes I'm just forgetful, maybe a little bit selfish, but it's
  just I get caught up in things. He understands that. When he gets really pissed
  off with me, it's when he thinks I'm being deliberately rude. Daddy can't stand
  rudeness. If he thinks I'm being inconsiderate to him, or to someone else,
  or lying to him, then he gets really upset with me. And then it's not a game
  any more Sam. Then it's a real punishment.� 
As if to emphasise the seriousness of a real punishment, the CD suddenly ended,
  leaving the two girls thinking in silence. From the open windows, they began
  to hear the sounds of the city outside, sirens far off, the endless hum of
  traffic, occasional voices in the street eight floors below. 
�If you go in my bedroom,� Nikki said, �look at what's hanging on the wall
  above the bed.� 
�I didn't notice �� 
�So go and have a look, then.� 
Sam pushed herself up off the sofa and, tripping at first over her long tipsy
  legs, went to the bedroom. �Oh,� came out of the bedroom doorway. She came
  back standing above Nikki in front of the sofa, holding out a thick strip of
  heavy black leather, about a foot-and-a-half-long and three inches wide. It
  was in fact one longer black strip doubled over into a loop, then stitched
  together along the length, with a metal V like a buckle protruding at one end.
  In short, an old-fashioned barber's razor strop. 
�Nikki � my god � this looks wicked � does your Daddy really �� 
�Only once,� said Nikki. �Only once. I keep it hanging over the bed as a reminder.
  Though you know I'm not going to forget it in a hurry.� 
�He hit you with this � on your bottom?� 
�On my bottom, then on my thighs, the inside and outsides of my thighs, then,
  last of all, he made me open my legs very wide, and he gave me five with that
  right between the legs, on my pussy.� 
�Christ � you must've screamed the house down �� 
Nikki shook her head. She swallowed, remembering. �No, when Daddy punishes
  me hard, he scrunches up my panties and puts them in my mouth, like a gag.
  And when he hits me, I bite down really hard on the panties. So I don't scream,
  really. Just kind of whimper, really. And I cry a lot. I always cry. Daddy
  calls me his big crybaby.� 
�But he's only beaten you with this once �� 
�With that, yes. Usually if I've just been a little bit naughty he spanks
  me with his hand, over his knee. If I've been really bad he uses the paddle � that's
  in the drawer under the bed, if you're interested. Sometimes as well he gives
  me a few strokes with the crop between the legs. If I'm getting a serious spanking
  he doesn't put me over his knee. When I'm lying on his knee I just wriggle
  about a lot and get myself all excited � and get Daddy excited too. And it
  feels nice and comfortable, kind of safe, having that contact with him. But
  when I've been really bad it's not like that. I have to kneel on the bed � like
  this �� 
Nikki got herself into a doggie position on the sofa. On her knees, her face
  was pressed down into the sofa, black hair all spread around, long arms stretched
  in front, like praying, with her breasts squashed into the sofa, and her back
  arched up so her bottom stuck out into the air. Her legs were as far apart
  as they would go in the black knee-length dress. �Normally I'd be completely
  naked, and Daddy would make me open my legs much wider, so he can get the paddle
  in to get my inner thighs � and if he wants to hit my pussy.� 
�Wow,� said Sam. Sam stood there in front of the sofa, shifting a little from
  foot to foot, shaking her head in amazement. Then, stretching out her arm rather
  meekly, she slapped the strap very lightly against Nikki's bottom. She laughed. �Christ.� 
Nikki rolled out of the position and sat up again. 
Sam shook her head. �I don't know Nikki, � I don't know if I could do that.
  I mean, he must be really hurting you with that thing� it's not just a game,
  is it �� 
�No, it's not just a game. I said, it's a part of our relationship. He's my
  Daddy, and he takes charge of me � if I'm naughty, I get punished. But if I'm
  good, then it's really good. He's really good to me, Sam. I mean, look at all
  this, and more importantly � wait till you meet Daddy � you see, I know it
  may seem strange to you, but it's worth it � the worst punishment, the worst
  punishment would be if my Daddy didn't love me any more. And if he let me just
  turn into a spoilt, nasty little brat, then I know I'd lose him. Even that
  time when he punished me with the strop, I always knew that I could say no.
  But if I did that how would I make him respect me, after the stupid brat I'd
  been? I would lose his respect, and then it would change � so I wanted him
  to punish me, I asked him to do it � actually it was my idea that he use the
  strop, I knew I needed that �� 
Nikki poured out the end of the bottle. �Sam, look � I didn't really know
  what to think of it at first either � but it was what we agreed on from the
  beginning, I went into it with my eyes open. And, well, I don't like being
  punished Sam, but you know it is really kind of sexy, isn't it? Don't you think
  so? Not when it's really hurting, but when I think about it now � it does make
  me feel pretty yummy to think about it. And afterwards, after I've been punished,
  well � that's when it's the best ever. So be honest with me Samantha, just
  picture yourself for a moment kneeling on that bed, naked, with your legs spread
  wide open, waiting for the strap, not knowing when it's going to come, but
  just waiting there, the air on your bare pussy. Doesn't the thought of it make
  you feel just a bit gooey inside?� 
Sam drank the glass down. �Alright Nikki, maybe it does. I don't know. Maybe
  I know what you mean, but still I don't know if I'd ever let anyone do that
  to me � anyway, it's your choice I suppose �� 
Nikki jumped up to change the CD. �Anyway, talking about getting a spanking,
  we'd better start clearing up all this mess � if Daddy comes and finds the
  place like this.� 
Sam started picking up shoes and underwear. Nikki carried the empty bottles,
  glasses and ashtray through to the kitchen. The music came on loud again, and
  they danced as they cleaned up. 
In the kitchen, where Nikki was washing the glasses, Sam leaned against the
  doorframe and said, �Nikki, so what did you do exactly to get the strop?� 
Nikki laughed. �Oh, so you're not sure if it turns you on then �.� 
�Well � it was just a simple question.� 
�Was it? Well maybe I'll tell you, or maybe not. Maybe later, if you're a
  good girl, I'll tell you the story of how naughty Nikki got the razor strop �� 
The phone was ringing. Barefoot, Nikki ran first to the stereo and turned
  the volume down, then dived over the back of the sofa, reaching for where the
  phone sat on the mosaic coffee table � 
�Daddy?� Her voice was all little-girl-caramel. �Yes Daddy, my friend Sam
  came round to play � she loves the apartment Daddy, she won't stop going on
  about it, she's really jealous� does she want to stay for dinner? I'll ask,
  Daddy. Yes, of course � yes, I know she'd love to meet you � yes Daddy, I'll
  be ready then, I'll make everything just how you like � thank you Daddy, love
  you too Daddy �� 
She put the phone down. �Well then babe. Daddy says do you want to stay for
  dinner. What do you think? Still want to meet him, or are you worried you might
  not be able to stop yourself getting bent over my Daddy's knee and getting
  those cheeks reddened?� 
Sam ignored the last comment, though she couldn't hide her blush � her face
  had gone bright red. �What do you think Nikki? � of course I'll stay �� 
�Fantastic. You can give me a hand with dinner. Oh, and Sam, Daddy says if
  you want we can have a sleepover ��
