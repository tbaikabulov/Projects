Part of an all new sensuality series on MistressPriya.com
�That&#8217;s a heck lot of water balloons you&#8217;re carrying there!�

�Umm, yeah Priya. I was just taking them to the apartment gardens. Me and the guys would play with them, like we always do during the Holi festival.�

�Hmm, and what sort of games do you losers play with these?�

�Losers?�

�Alright, you fine gentlemen with the water balloons��

�Oh, it&#8217;s a simple game. Each of us starts with twenty balloons. We throw them on each other, while escaping the balloons thrown by the other players. The one who remains most dry at the end, while throwing the most balloons on other players- wins.�

�Hah. That&#8217;s what I thought.�

�What..?�

�Doesn&#8217;t everyone get wet at the end of these stupid games?�

�Well, the water does splash on to��

�So everyone&#8217;s a loser?�

�Uh�..�

�Is that a yes? Aren&#8217;t all of you losers?�

�Uh��

�Anyway, give me one of those.�

�You want one of my balloons?�

�Yes.�

�But we always start with twenty.�

�Aww, you&#8217;re not going to give me one of your precious little water balloons?�

�Well, okay. Here you go. Just one.�

�Mmmm� haha. This is nice.�

�What do you plan to do with it?�

�Throw it on your face!�

�But�it&#8217;s my balloon. I filled it for the games��

�You know what me and the girls think of the guys who play these stupid games? You&#8217;re all such cheap losers��

�Priya, I&#8217;m serious. Please give me back my balloon.�

�No I won&#8217;t. You&#8217;re not going to go to the gardens and be another one of those loser nerds in that group.�

�I&#8217;m not?�

�Nope.�

�Oh, what else am I going to do?�

�This Holi, you&#8217;re going to be my personal loser nerd.�

�What?�

�You and I are going to play with these water balloons, and I&#8217;m going to win. Here, eat this balloon!�

(Pop! Splash! Sobs�)

�Ha ha! I won! Your face is all wet!�

�Aww, that went into my eyes!�

�Are you going to be a loser crybaby, too? Isn&#8217;t it bad enough that you&#8217;re a loser?�

�Wah�.mommy�.!�

�Shut up! Get down on your knees and surrender the rest of the balloons to the winner.�

�You&#8217;re not the winner. We never even agreed to the rules of the game, you attacked me from nowhere, without warning��

�On your knees, loser!�

�Yes, Priya.�

�Don&#8217;t look at me! Look down at the floor.�

�Sorry, Priya.�

�Now, congratulate me for winning this game.�

�You&#8217;re a cheater.�

�Do you want me to slap you? Because I will��

�Okay, congratulations on your victory.�

�Hmm, say it with more sincerity.�

�Priya, you are the greatest player of water balloons I have ever encountered. You have beaten me fair and square.�

�That&#8217;s right. And you are nothing but a sorry ass loser.�

�I&#8217;m nothing but a sorry ass loser.�

�Good. Now as a sorry ass loser, you must surrender your arsenal of water balloons to the winner. The winner now has the right to do anything to the loser with the water balloons.�

�What do you mean.. anything?�

�Hey, are you about to surrender or do you want me to make you?�

�Alright, alright. I hand you my full packet of water balloons. You can do anything you want with me, using these.�

�Say why.�

�Because you&#8217;re the winner and I&#8217;m a sorry ass loser.�

�My personal sorry-ass loser.�

�Your personal sorry-ass loser.�

�Exactly. Let me pick one of these juicy red ones. Hmm. Where am I going to throw this? Am I going to blast this one on your face again, or am I going to throw it on my loser&#8217;s chest?�

�Please�get it over with.�

�Hmm, but it&#8217;s such a hard decision. How am I ever going to know for sure?�

�I�I&#8217;m feeling the rubber surface on my mouth.�

�Yup. That&#8217;s a good place.� (Pop! Splash!) �Haha! My double loser!�

�Aww. You hammered through my teeth!�

�I can do whatever I want, because I&#8217;m a winner.�

�Priya, that was dirty tap water and some of it went in my mouth��

�Shut up, you loser! Let me see, I&#8217;ll throw this green balloon on you next.�

�(Sob�)�

�That way, my personal loser will taste all the colors of his own collection.�

�(Sob�)�

�Here you go, boy. Eat this one.� (Pop! Splash!) �Haha! Your own water ballons, defeating you like a dog.�

�I can&#8217;t see a thing�!�

�Oh, maybe you should lie down.�

�On the floor?�

�Yes, where else would losers get to lie down?�

�Alright, I&#8217;m down. I hope you know what you&#8217;re doing, this floor&#8217;s really cold.�

�I know exactly what I&#8217;m doing.�

�So you&#8217;ll get me eye-drops?�

�Nah! Just lie still and I will fix you right back.�

�Okay.�

�Let&#8217;s start by keeping that on your face.�

�Is that�another water balloon?�

�Exactly!�

�Oh no! What are you going to do?�

�Stomp it with my shoes.�

�Priya! No! Please��

(Pop! Splash!)

�Haha! That was a good stomp.�

�I think my skull broke.�

�Aww, you&#8217;re saying that like it&#8217;s a bad thing.�

�Priya, I could feel the underside patterns of your sports shoe on my face. What do you think you&#8217;re��

�Here! Eat a blue water balloon for me.�

�Mm.mmmm.mmmmmmmmph.�

(Pop! Splash!)

�Haha! That was my left foot. I think it didn&#8217;t stomp hard enough.�

�Priya, it was plenty hard��

�I guess it needs a little more practice. Why don&#8217;t you shut up and kiss this black one for me, so I can practice once more?�

(Pop! Splash!)

�Ooooooooowchh!�

�I guess that&#8217;s some good practice! Now, lie still. I&#8217;m going to step on your chest.�

�Why? Why would you want to make it worse? What did I ever do to you?�

�It&#8217;s not something you did. It&#8217;s just who you are. Now shut up.�

�Aaah�.�

�I said, shut up!�

�Gnnnnn..�

�Now, let&#8217;s carefully place two water balloons on your face.�

�Two? Are you trying to kill me?�

�Let&#8217;s say so. Now, be completely still while I step on your face with my shoes and crush those water balloons on your loser face.�

�Whatever��

(Pop! Splash!)

(Pop! Splash!)

�Loser! Loser! Haha! I feel so good dancing on your loser face.�

�Mmmmph..�

�But now, look at my shoes. They&#8217;re all wet and it&#8217;s all your fault.�

�I&#8217;m sorry.�

�Sorry is just not going to cut it. I&#8217;m going to kick your face ten times as punishment.�

�But you&#8217;re the one who��

(Whap!)

�What were you going to say?�

�N..nothing. I&#8217;m sorry.�

(Whap! Whap! Whap! Whap!)

�How does it feel, taking kicks from my wet shoes on your face?�

�(Sobs.)�

(Whap!�.Whap!)

�Ahh, loser took ten kicks from me. That is sweet. Now you better be plenty sorry, loser.�

�I&#8217;m sorry.�

�Sorry for what?�

�For being a sorry ass loser who made your shoe wet.�

�Good. Now, I want you to kiss my shoes and remove them from my feet.�

�Priya, I&#8217;m almost blind. Please, I need help��

�If you ever make me repeat myself again, I&#8217;m going to��

�Alright! I&#8217;ll take them off.�

�That&#8217;s like a good loser boy. Take them off and smell my socks. Right up your nose.�

�Gnnnnnnnh��

�How do they smell?�

�They&#8217;re�umm..�

�Well?�

�Very�sweet?�

�Sweet? You want them in your mouth?�

�I�do?�

�Yes you do. Go on. Remove them and put them in your mouth. Suck &#8216;em like a lollipop.�

�Yes, Priya.�

�Now you can&#8217;t possibly talk, can you? Haha.�

�Gnnnmmph!�

�Well, let&#8217;s put two more water balloons on your face. And now I&#8217;ll stomp them with my bare feet.�

�Gnnnnnoooo!�

(Pop! Splash!)

(Pop! Splash!)

�Hmm, now there&#8217;s ten more of your balloons left in this bag. What am I going to do? Hmm, what am I��

�Gnnnnnn!�

�I know. I&#8217;ll keep one on your groin and stomp it��

�Pthoo! No! Please, Priya. That&#8217;s just too far. I might die right here.�

�Did you just spit out my socks from your mouth, loser?�

�N..no? I just respectfully��

�Well, pick them up and stuff them in your mouth. You don&#8217;t get to talk back to me.�

�(Sob, sob)��

�That&#8217;s better. I&#8217;m going to stomp your balls four times, just for that. Here we go. The first water balloon on your dick. This is your punishment for spitting out my sock.�

(Pop! Splash!)

�Awwwwwww!�

�And now one more.�

(Pop! Splash!)

�Bpbp��

�How sore are your balls now, huh?�

�Mmmph��

�Here, take one more.�

(Pop! Splash!)

�Oooww��

�And one more.�

(Pop! Splash!)

�Booohoo�.�

�Let me burst one more in your mouth, so the water seeps down to your throat through my dirty wet socks. Hmm, there you go, right on your mouth.�

�Mmmmmph!�

�Hmm, you feel the rubber on your lips?�

�Mm-hmmm.�

�You smell the gaps of my toes?�

�Mm-hmmm.�

�Now, I will crush it with the mules of my feet. Ready or not, you&#8217;ll eat this, loser!�

(Pop! Splash!)

�Hrmph!�

�Sucking in the juice, loser?�

�Gnnnnnnnn�.�

�Winner&#8217;s sock juice for losers, haha! Now, it&#8217;s time for the walk.�

�Mmmhmm?�

�The walk of victory, in which I step all over you and declare you my new pet!�

�Gnnnnn!�

�Aww, poochie poo. Look at my little doggie, protesting the inevitable. You&#8217;re my own personal loser, aren&#8217;t you? Didn&#8217;t we just discuss that bit?�

�Hnnnn��

�So I&#8217;m going to take you home and kick you whenever I want. You will live at my feet, waiting for my kicks.�

�Grnnnnn!�

�Let&#8217;s see, five more water balloons. Where do I keep them? I know, let&#8217;s start with one at the groin.�

�Grnnnnnn!�

�And one at the stomach. Your softie softie tummie.�

�Grrrrrrrrnnnnnnnnnnnnn!�

�One at your little loser chest. One at your neck!�

�Nnnnnnnnnnnnnn!�

�And the last one on your face. Here we go, the winner walks all over the loser. I wish the world was watching this.�

(Pop! Splash!)

(Pop! Splash!)

(Pop! Splash!)

(Pop! Splash!)

(Pop! Splash!)

�Nnnnnnnnnnn���.�

�Ahh, all twenty of the loser&#8217;s water balloons, blasted on his own body.�

�Grrrrrrrrrnnnnnn.�

�What? I guess I&#8217;ll take out my socks from your mouth, using just my wiggly wiggly little toes. Ooh, this is hard��

�You&#8217;re so cruel. Such a bully. I&#8217;m going to tell on you.�

�Haha! You&#8217;re going to tell on me? What&#8217;ll you say? &#8216;Mummy, mummy. The neighbor girl beat me up like a dog.&#8217; That&#8217;s more humiliating for you than me.�

�I&#8217;ll tell your parents.�

�They&#8217;re quite aware of my bullying issue, and they silently embrace it. They want a daughter who&#8217;s ready to take on the world, not a wimpy little loser character like you.�

�Boo hooo��

�Priya, please let me go. You&#8217;ve spoiled my games already and punished me with my own balloons.�

�I gave you exactly what you deserve. Now, you&#8217;re going to come home and wipe my feet. They&#8217;re all wet from stomping the crap out of you��

�You keep saying that like it&#8217;s my fault.�

�It is your fault. I had to teach your a lesson in maturity and respecting your superiors. Should we go over it again?�

�Hmphhhhhhhhhh. Please step off my face, Priya��

�Call me Princess.�

�What?�

�Princess. I like it when losers call me that.�

�O, Princess Priya. Please step your foot off my face.�

�Right. There you go. Come, let&#8217;s go upstairs to my room. You&#8217;ll start working for me from now.�

�Yes, Princess.�

�Now start wiping my feet dry. Using your clothes��
