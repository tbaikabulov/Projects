Synopsis:   Emily, heavily in debt, takes a job as a waitress for the evening.  But greedy for money she is tricked into an evening of humiliation and torment






The Dinner Party

1. An appointment

Emily strode angrily down the street. How could she have got herself into this situation - she had rich parents and had been to an excellent school. She should have had everything going for her but here she was on her way to a one-off waitressing job - how demeaning could it get. If only she had held back - had seen common sense. But managing the finances for her and her flatmates meant that the rent money was always sitting in her account - and it was just too tempting. But to spend it on drugs - that was really low. What would happen if they found out - it 
would be sure to get out and everyone would know - even her parents. Her parents
- the thought of it - with their high principles and high hopes for her. Insisting that she make her own way in the world without the help of their money. Letting her grind away the days in a pointless admin job when they could give her enough to set her up for life.

So now the rent money had gone - spend on enough for one night on a high - and the rent was due in a week. A single night waitressing was not going to do it but at this stage she had to take any chance she could and so here she was, dressed the part and off to earn a miserable fifty pounds. What to wear had caused considerable difficulty as the agency had not been too specific, but in the end she opted for a simple white cotton blouse and a short black skirt, with black tights and heels. Actually she felt rather good - she was rather proud of her legs and was aware that she turned a few heads as she walked. Perhaps she would pick up afew tips tonight - anything would help.

The house was large and set back from the road. Emily walked up the steps and rang the bell.&nbsp; After what seemed like an age the door was opened by a tall man dressed in a suit and tie. He was in his 50s and had that confidence of the very wealthy who are used to being in control.
"Come in, come in, you must be Emily", his voice was low pitched and powerful
"How do you do Mr Davis" said Emily walking in past him.
"You look very nice dear" said Davis "the agency said you were suitable"
"Thank you sir"
"Now - have you waitressed before?"
"No"
"Well no matter - I have very particular requirements so your experience wouldn't be relevant anyway"
Wierd, thought Emily - what does he mean by that.
"Now - I am a demanding employer but I expect to pay for good service
"As I say, I have some unusual requirements but I will pay you well for them - do you think you could manage that?"
"What sort of requrements?"
"Oh nothing too difficult. Now I want to make you an offer"
"Yes?"
"Here is the deal. You agree to meet everything that I ask of you this evening and in return I will give you ï¿½1000 in cash at the end of the evening - how does that sound?"
Emily could hardly believe her ears - a thousand pounds? She would be off the hook with her flatmates and everything would be back to normal. But what did he want her to do? Who cares, it's only one evening - tomorrow at this time she would be home with the money back in the bank.
"Well - er - OK - I suppose"
"Excellent - now sign here to confirm our terms"
"What is it?"
"Oh just a standard contract to keep the IRS off our backs!"
Emily wondered if she should read it but it looked like normal contract stuff - her head was still full of the thousand pounds she would get and not much else would bother her now. She bent and signed the paper.
"Just one thing" said Davis "if you give up at any time and walk out you will not get a penny - understand?"
"OK"
"Right - follow me"

2. Preparation

Davis led the way up the stairs and turned left into what looked like a bedroom.
"I know you look good in your outfit" he said "but I need you to wear something a little more appropriate for this event. I have six dinner guests and they have very high expectations of my parties"
He went to the side of the room and sat in an armchair.
"Take off your blouse"
"What!" Emilies head shot up and she stared at him.
"I think you heard me - take off your blouse"
"You are joking I take it?"
"Certainly not - I need you to change - take it off at once"
"No!"
"Well in that case stop wasting my time and get out"
On the point of leaving Emily suddenly imagined breaking the news to her flat mates about the missing rent.
"Go on - get out!"
"No - wait - but do you have to watch?"
"Who is paying your wages"
Slowly Emily's hands went to the buttons of her blouse and began to fumble with them. Reddening she slipped out of the sleeves and dropped the blouse to the floor. Her firm 34C breasts standing proud in their white sheer bra.
"Good - now your skirt"
"But really - just let me change in the bathroom"
"Do it!"
Reluctantly she undid the cilip on her skirt and let it fall to the ground - standing now in unflattering tights.
"Take off your shoes and remove your tights"
Shaking slightly she began to roll her tights down over her legs and dropped them onto the floor.
"Now stand up and let me look at you - hm - I suppose you will do.
"Now take off your underwear - and no fussing this time"
"But ......."
"For the last time- do it or get out"
"OK ..." now shivering noticably she undid the bra and let it fall. Glancing towards him she pulled down her panties and left them on the floor. Her shaved sex clear for him to see.
"Right" he said, gathering up her clothes "I said you could go at any time, and so you can. But I am locking these clothes away so if you leave you leave without them!"
"But .... you can't do that!"
"I can and I will you silly girl!"
"Now - it's time for your uniform"
Davis went to the cupboard and brought out the what looked like a flimsy piece of material. He threw it towards her:
"Put this on"
Emily held it up - it was like a very short nightie - it was black but made out of the most sheer see through material she had ever seen.
"Quickly girl"
Emily pulled it over her head
"What else do you want me to wear?"
"Nothing else - just shoes"
"But .... everyone will see me - it doesn't even cover my backside"
"Of course - you are a decoration at my party - why cover you up?"

"But sir, please - it's too embarrassing"
"Now - your shoes"
Davis went to the cupboard again and brought out what looked at first sight
like a normal pair of stillettoes. Except that there seemed to be a cut away part where the heel would normally rest.
"Look how clever these are! If you walk on tiptoe you are absolutely fine and comfortable. If you rest your heel down a spike attached to the stiletto comes up through the sole and into your heel
- very painful! I don't think you will get that wrong too often"
"No - this is ridiculous - you can't expect me ....."
"Leave then - go on - you will look great on the street - might get
picked
up!" he laughed.
Bending, he picked up her right foot and strapped the shoe tightly.
Then the same with the left.
"Stand up"
Emiliy stood and immediatly felt a stab in her heel as the needle sharp point made its presence felt.
"On tiptoe"
Up she went - she could manage this at the moment but for how long?
"Please ...."
A bell sounded downstairs
"Come on - you have to let our guests in - downstairs quickly"
"No - I can't be seen like this"
"QUICKLY"
