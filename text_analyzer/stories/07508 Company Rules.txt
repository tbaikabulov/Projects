Company Rules

Laura Harper joined the staff of Gilbert and Mayes from university five years ago. She had graduated with a First Class Honours Degree in Psychology from Cardiff and then decided to use these skills in the world of advertising.
Gilbert and Mayes were one of the foremost London agencies founded in 1952 and had quickly developed a respected reputation in advertising and were rewarded with a number of high profile multi-national accounts. Their success continued to blossom to the present day and they now employ more than 300 staff in&nbsp; prime office accommodation off Regent Street in London.
Laura Harper was a bright and attractive girl with a bubbly personality. She had excelled in academia and was also a competent sportswoman, representing her university in hockey. She had impressed the Board of Gilbert and Mayes and was offered a graduate training position with them in September 2003. Since then she had secured a number of promotions and was now a Senior Account Manager working to her Account Director, Chris Hughes.
She married her long term boyfriend Terry, some 15 months ago and they were blissfully happy together. They managed to buy, with parental help, a mortgage on a small two bed-roomed flat, in Balham South London. Laura commuted to her office and Terry, an IT consultant was starting his own business working from home.
Laura was highly regarded by her work colleagues and the success of the agency enabled&nbsp; her to enjoy a high level of remuneration &#8211; a basic salary of �35,000, but in good times the opportunity, to share company bonuses.
Gilbert and Mayes was founded by Albert Gilbert and Stephen Mayes, long since retired, but the Company remained in the private control of their descendants. Through careful selection and nurturing, the Company employees were loyal, hardworking and totally committed. Few left the Company &#8211; a rare phenomenon in the world of advertising.
The Company had traditional values and rules which were designed to maintain the highest standards. Employee gender was almost equally split and there was an emphasis of total equality between the sexes. Employees were required to adhere to the Company dress code &#8211; males wore smart suits, shirt and ties and the females, skirts, blouses and jackets &#8211; trousers were not permitted.
A Disciplinary code was in place and employees were required to sign up to this when they were engaged. Acts of general misconduct were recognised with demerit marks. Gross misconduct fell outside this system and was dealt with separately by the Board.
Ten demerit marks in any six month period resulted in the imposition of a disciplinary award. This caused the employee to receive a formal written warning together with a financial penalty which was not inconsiderable &#8211; a fine of �250 for each demerit mark. This could however be mitigated by the employees submission to an alternative punishment of a caning. This was not however available if there was a repetition in the following 18 month period. In such a case the employee would receive a Final Written Warning and would have the punishment imposed. The Board had decreed that it would not be appropriate or effective to allow the employee similar successive punishments. Any employee refusing to accept the disciplinary structure in place could resign or would be dismissed for breach of employment contract. To date, no one had challenged this &#8211; probably because of their desire to remain with Gilbert and Mayes.
After lunch on 15 September, Laura received a telephone call from the HR Director, Alison Mayes asking her to call into her office. This surprised Laura but she made her way directly to Alison&#8217;s office and was told to go straight in by Alison&#8217;s secretary.
�Please take a seat Laura� was Alison&#8217;s not unfriendly greeting. �I&#8217;m afraid that you have recorded ten demerits�. �There must be some mistake was Laura&#8217;s horrified response�.
�Well let&#8217;s see. 20 July, 4 demerits from Chris Hughes for failing to meet a deadline on the Anders&#8217; account which resulted in a loss of �15k. One demerit from Peter Jones, Security Officer, on 1 August for a second loss of your car park swipe card. A further demerit from Peter Jones on 16 August for leaving your computer logged on and unattended. Two demerits from Chris Hughes on 20 August for late attendance at a client meeting which was deemed unprofessional conduct. A further demerit from Peter Jones on 14 September for loss and replacement of ID and a demerit for unauthorised lateness of 16 minutes on the same day. I think you&#8217;ll find that totals ten?�
Laura was almost lost for words. �I was aware of the six from Chris but wasn&#8217;t of all those from Peter Jones�. Alison responded - �Well Peter doesn&#8217;t always spell out that he has reported a demerit &#8211; I assume that he believes that the employee should be aware that certain misconduct leads to an automatic demerit mark. Did he advise you at the time that you had breached the rules?� &#8211; �Yes, he did but I rather hoped it would have been treated as a warning�. 
�Laura, you&#8217;ve worked here for over five years and I know that this is your first Disciplinary. I&#8217;m really sorry. This is so unlike you. &#8211; do you have any personal problems that you&#8217;d like to discuss?�
�Things are a trifle challenging at home with Terry setting up his own business &#8211; it&#8217;s possible this has distracted me somewhat�
�Laura, I&#8217;m not sure if I can help you. If the loss of ID and unauthorised lateness were related you could submit representations to the Board. The problem is that if they were not persuaded you could receive up to a further five demerits from them for unreasonable challenge and time-wasting. Even if you managed to successfully argue your case you would be at risk should you incur a further demerit within the next four months or so, but of course this must be your decision�.
�Thanks Alison for the advice. Can I think it over before deciding?�
�Of course but you will need to let me know by tomorrow morning�.
�I&#8217;ll do that, thanks. Can you just run through the options that I have?�
�Well, if you decide to submit representations to the Board &#8211; they will hear the case within three days. If you decide not to represent, you will have to choose either to pay the financial penalty of �2,500.00 and this will be deducted from your salary at the end of this month. If you elect to receive the alternative award of a caning this will have to be carried out within eight days &#8211; 10 strokes. The eight days was agreed by the Board to accommodate menstrual cycles but it applies to males as well &#8211; to reinforce the equality rule. You can apply to the Board for a longer delay but there would have to be exceptional circumstances &#8211; an upcoming holiday would not be seen as such but a pre-arranged medical could be &#8211; hope that&#8217;s helpful?�
�Can the fine be paid in instalments?�
�I&#8217;m afraid not Laura. When setting the rules the Board felt that to allow this would be to minimise the punitive effect &#8211; the same applies to any caning�.
�OK Alison, that&#8217;s all very clear. Can I see you tomorrow morning and give you my decision?�
�That&#8217;ll be fine &#8211; I should be free at 10am but check with my secretary first thing�.
Laura left work that evening in a very dejected mood and wasn&#8217;t looking forward to telling Terry. She arrived home at about 7pm &#8211; Terry was in good humour and quite upbeat about his day.
�Terry, I need to tell you about a problem at work�. Laura then explained her Disciplinary award and the options available.
Terry was very understanding and sympathetic to her plight and suggested that she pay the financial penalty, even though this would leave them with an overdraft for a month or so. Laura was not convinced that this was the best option as it would be difficult to explain the salary shortfall and running an overdraft at a time he was setting up a business was not healthy. She would not contemplate a loan or an approach to their parents for assistance &#8211; �I really don&#8217;t want them to know about this�.
Terry didn&#8217;t want her to take the caning and implored her to pay the fine.
The next day, Laura set off for work in something of a daze. She dismissed the idea of appealing to the Board as too risky.
When she arrived at work she contacted Alison&#8217;s secretary and confirmed an appointment for 10am.
She presented at the appointed time and was sent straight in.
�Well Laura, what&#8217;s it to be?�
�I don&#8217;t think that I&#8217;ve really got an alternative to taking the caning Alison &#8211; so, that&#8217;s my decision�.
�Right, Laura. Assuming that you&#8217;re not going to apply for an extension, you will need to make an appointment with Peter Jones at a mutually convenient time within the next eight days. Once this is arranged, Peter will advise me of the date and time. You will need to report to me fifteen minutes before this to collect the cane. I&#8217;m afraid that this is part of the punishment &#8211; the &#8216;walk of shame&#8217;. You will walk down taking with you the cane and form of consent &#8211; not taking the lift &#8211; to the staff refreshment lounge on the ground floor and wait outside at least 5 minutes before your appointment. Peter Jones will then summon you into the vacant Lounge. You will hand him the cane together with the signed consent form and follow his instructions. You will be required to touch your toes and you will then receive the 10 strokes. You should try and remain in position throughout but in any event, you will not receive a stroke until you are in this position. As you should know, the caning is given &#8216;on the bare&#8217;. This is where the ladies are rather disadvantaged. The men just have to drop their trousers and assume the position. You can wear a normal skirt &#8211; nothing on underneath though - and lift this before bending over. However, there is often a problem of the skirt falling back down during the caning. I would advise that you wear a short tennis dress or something similar that will expose the target area when you bend over. You could alternatively remove your skirt altogether but most ladies prefer to safeguard their modesty by pulling it up &#8211; its also much easier when the caning is over to just let the skirt drop down. I&#8217;m afraid this will hurt a great deal, Laura &#8211; Peter is instructed to deliver the canings in equal measure to males and females and I know that he doesn&#8217;t hold back. He is just doing the job asked of him. When it is over, Peter will sign a form of completion and you will need to sign this as well and bring it directly to me together with the cane. Again you will need to walk up the stairs. Any questions?�
�No. I wont be seeking an extension and have no cause to delay. I think I&#8217;d like to get it over with as soon as possible. I&#8217;ll try and arrange for this afternoon and pop out at lunchtime for a short skirt�
�Fine Laura. You may also want to buy some witch hazel to help with the bruising afterwards? &#8211; Probably see you later. Good luck!�
Peter Jones joined Gilbert and Mayes as Security Officer following his retirement from The Metropolitan Police as an Inspector in 2005. He is a tall and imposing man but always pleasant in his dealings with staff and clients. He takes his job seriously and has made numerous improvements to the overall security of the Company and offices. He has two assistants, who are not from a police background. He undertakes his role for administering corporal punishment professionally but appears to derive little pleasure from this. He is called upon to administer canings perhaps no more than half a dozen times a year. He has consistently stated that this is testament to the efficacy of the system. 
When Laura Harper returned to her office she sat down, picked up her telephone and dialled the security office. One of the assistants responded but she was soon connected to Peter Jones.
�Hello Peter, its Laura Harper. I need to make an appointment to receive a disciplinary caning from you. If possible, I&#8217;d very much like to get it over with &#8211; would this afternoon be possible?�
�Mrs Harper, in view of the business in hand I think that you should call me Mr Jones or Sir &#8211; at least until we have concluded this matter. 4.15pm would be suitable and will enable me to reserve the room without inconveniencing too many members of staff. One of my assistants, Michael Mates, will be in attendance for training purposes in order to cover these duties in my absence &#8211; this has been agreed by the Board.&nbsp; I will see you promptly at the appointed time�.
�Thank you Mr Jones�.Sir. I will present myself as required at this time. Good morning Sir�.
The morning progressed slowly and Laura earned a rebuke from her Account Director, Chris Hughes. She explained the reason for her absent mindedness to her line manager. He expressed understanding and sympathised with her. He said that he would like to see her the following day to review her performance and offer support and guidance.
At 1pm, Laura Harper left the offices of Gilbert and Mayes. She was rather embarrassed to see Peter Jones but he just nodded to her. She purchased a white tennis skirt from a local sports shop and then entered Boots the Chemist and found a small bottle of witch hazel. She also purchased some ibuprofen thinking this would help with the after pain.
She returned to her office and worked on a couple of her accounts until 3.45 pm. She then rose from her desk, picked up her hand bag and carrier bag containing the tennis skirt and made her way to the office of her account executives. She told Jane and Jonathon that she would be unavailable for the next hour or so. Jane stated that she was aware that this was likely as Laura had been acting strangely for the last couple of days and a notice had been posted advising staff that the lounge would be temporarily unavailable between 4 and 4.45 pm today. �There is a general rumour around the building that someone is down for a caning and putting two and two together we feared it might be you. We are so sorry�.
Laura thanked them for their concern and then made her way o the ladies rest room on the third floor. She removed her skirt, tights and panties and put these in the carrier bag. She put on the wrap around tennis skirt and replaced her black shoes which now looked a little incongruous with the rest of her outfit. She deposited her handbag and carrier bag in her office and made her way towards Alison Mayes office arriving at 4pm. She was ushered straight in. Alison produced a consent form and asked Laura to sign this. She then went to a cupboard and extracted a cane. It was about three feet in length with a crooked handle and looked absolutely terrifying. She gave Laura a sympathetic look before handing her the cane and consent form. �Good luck Laura &#8211; it&#8217;ll soon be over. Now straight down to the staff lounge and wait for Mr Jones to call you in. I&#8217;ll see you afterwards when we will need to complete the formalities�.
Laura left Alison&#8217;s office and couldn&#8217;t avoid being the centre of attraction. People looked at her as she made her way towards the ground floor lounge. No one spoke to her, some gave her a smile, others an embarrassed glance away. She arrived at the ground floor and waited outside the staff lounge. She started to tremble and didn&#8217;t really know what to do with herself. She looked over to the reception desk where the receptionist and assistant security officer were sitting. They smiled at her and turned away. She looked at the clock &#8211; 4.11pm &#8211; She felt rather exposed in the short dress and tried to tug the hem down but to no avail. She wanted to rub her bottom but didn&#8217;t think this appropriate with people around. She noticed some visitors who glanced across to her and then engaged the receptionist in conversation &#8211; she assumed they were asking about her. At exactly 4.15 pm the lounge door opened and Mr Jones called her in and she closed the door behind her. Laura was relieved to be out of the public gaze but new feelings swamped her. She was trembling and covered in goose bumps. She now realised that a new ordeal was about to start. She noticed that Mr Jones and for that matter Mr Mates were unusually in shirt sleeves. Mr Jones was the epitome of formality. He called for Alison to approach him and addressed her. �Mrs Harper. You are to receive ten strokes of the cane. I will apply five strokes and this will be followed by a further five given by my assistant, Mr Mates. Do you have the consent form?� Laura handed this to him which he scrutinised and then placed down on a table. �The cane please�. Laura handed this to him. Mr Jones then swished this through the air a few times, Laura was terrified. �Now Mrs Harper. I want you to stand by this mark on the floor &#8211; which he pointed to with the tip of the cane &#8211; and face the window. On my instruction you will bend over and touch your toes. You may wish to pull your skirt up a little before doing so as we will need your entire bottom uncovered. Some ladies prefer to place their feet slightly apart for greater stability. Before we start I would point out that you elected to receive this caning &#8211; you had a choice, we do not. This is part of my job and I derive no pleasure in inflicting this punishment. Please remember this. I will expect you to count each stroke as it is delivered and thank me for it. I will not administer a stroke until you are in the prescribed position &#8211; legs straight and fingers touching your toes. Do you understand?�
�Yes Sir�.
�Bend over�
Laura pulled her skirt up slightly, bent over as instructed and awaited the dreaded first stroke. She heard Mr Jones swish the cane and then felt it touch her bottom. He pulled the cane back and brought it down hard across her bottom. There was an almighty swish followed by a crack like a pistol shot. Laura immediately felt an excruciating pain from her nether region, leapt up and started rubbing her bottom. She hadn&#8217;t expected such pain.
�You do need to count the strokes and please get back into position�.
�One Sir. Thank you�
Laura bent over. There was another swish and crack.
�Two thank you Sir�
She remained in position and received a further three strokes.
After the fifth stroke she was told to stand up.
�Mrs Harper. Mr Mates will now conclude your punishment. The same procedure will apply�.
He handed the cane to Mr Mates who proceeded to take imaginary strokes with it, Laura, watched this. He then instructed Laura to resume the position. She bent over and awaited the next stroke. This soon came and it was dreadfully painful. She stood up rubbing her bottom. Mr Jones commented �That was a little low Michael, try and raise it a little�.
�Back down! And remember you must count�
Laura bent over. �Sorry Sir. Six. Thank you�
A further three strokes were delivered in quick succession.
�Last one coming�. A final swish followed by the pistol crack.
�Ten. Thank you Sir�.
�You may now stand up and compose yourself. The caning has been completed.�
Laura burst into tears, whether relief at the conclusion of her ordeal or because of the dreadful pain she felt in her bottom, was debateable. Her hands went back to touch her bottom, normally soft and smooth, but now rough with pulsating ridges. She could feel the heat radiating from her buttocks and the pain was intense.
Mr Jones sat down and completed the documentation. He handed this form to Laura together with the cane and asked her to sign the form and instructed her to return the form and cane to Alison Mayes.
Not unkindly, Mr Jones said that Laura had taken her beating well but that her bottom would take a number of weeks to recover. Mr Jones and Mr Mates then left the lounge.
Laura was still sobbing but noticed the time was 4.40pm and realised that she too would have to go. She tried to compose herself, opened the door and walked up three flights of stairs to Alison Mayes office.
Alison was waiting for her and called her straight into the office, giving her a gentle hug. She took the cane from Laura together with the completion form
�I won&#8217;t ask you to sit down Laura but we do have one or two formalities to complete�. Alison sat at her desk, Laura stood in front facing her.
�As you know Laura, although the caning has been completed, I am required to issue you with this formal written notice.� She handed this to Laura.
�This document summarises your misconduct and requires you to address this. A copy of this will be given to your Account Director and he will arrange to see you to offer advice and guidance. A further copy will be retained on your personal file for a period of 18 months after which it will be removed without further detriment to you. This assumes that you do not accumulate another ten demerits in any six month period during this time. If you do, you will not be afforded the choice of punishment on that occasion and you will be given a final written warning. This could put you on the road to dismissal and we certainly don&#8217;t want that do we, Laura? Do you understand?�
�Yes Alison, I do. I&#8217;m sorry for my recent lapses and will do everything possible to ensure there is no repetition�.
�Thank you Laura. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d like go and to freshen up?�
With this Laura made her way to her office, picked up her bags and went directly to the ladies. She examined the damage in the mirror and was horrified. She could see purple horizontal lines covering the whole of her bottom and down to the top of her legs. She applied witch hazel to the welts and replaced her tennis skirt with her more modest business skirt. She left her tights and panties off and then returned to the solitude of her office.
It was in fact a full six weeks before the bruising disappeared from her buttocks.
