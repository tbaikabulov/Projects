This story might appear to be quite vanilla, and, indeed, to begin with it
  is simply about a wife swapping party. But like all my stories there's a twist
  at the end, and the twist in this one is decidedly Femdom. So have patience. 
&nbsp;End Game 
�I am not going to fuck in front of other people! You can forget that', Tracy
  pouted from the front seat of the car. 
We were on our way to my first swinging party. This was something I'd been
  hoping to do for more than three years and I had finally persuaded Tracy to
  come with me. You could say I was excited, excited almost to the point of being
  terrified. I'd only been able to eat half the size of dinner I usually do,
  and I felt like I might throw it up at any moment. I was breathing a lot quicker
  than normal, so much so that talking for any length of time was a fight against
  breathlessness. And my mouth was so dry my words stuck to the roof. My whole
  being was on edge; every little thing irritated me: like Tracy's latest challenge,
  like the sweat in my groin that was making my balls feel tacky, like my shoes
  that seemed to be a little too tight. I was a mess. I wanted this party so
  badly, I wanted my fantasy of an orgy, but I was so wound up right now I knew
  I couldn't get it up right now. But I had to go on. But then it must be the
  same for everyone, mustn't it? I had to believe that I would eventually relax
  and be able to perform. 
I'd been wanting to party ever since I'd read about such events in Forum  magazine.
  The thought that there were parties where you could have access to many women
  and could swap partners, maybe several times in an evening, had been doing
  my head in for years. I'd researched the scene extensively and found out about
  parties organised on a commercial basis, with quite steep entrance fees. That
  would have been worth it, but as soon as I suggested it to my wife, she'd turned
  me down, made it clear she wasn't keen. She had some serious misconceptions
  about what happened at such functions. For three years I'd kept on, explaining
  how they work, putting the reasons why we should go, trying to persuade her,
  trying to convince her that it would be fun. Obviously, I hadn't been keen
  to buy tickets knowing she would probably not come with me. I kept on putting
  the positive side and she kept saying no, but every time with less conviction.
  Then I'd got an invitation to a private party with free entrance. It was too
  good to turn down. I knew she wasn't keen, but I was sure I could persuade
  Tracy if only I tried hard enough, and long enough. So one final huge effort
  and then she agreed, and here I was, in the car, Tracy beside me, and in just
  a few moments I would realise my dream. 
Even now, Tracy wasn't as enthusiastic as I was, as you can tell from her
  language, but at least she'd agreed to accompany me. This was important because
  I couldn't go to the party on my own - like all such parties it was strictly
  couples only. She had liked the idea of the games and the flirting, and I think
  she even liked the idea of being able to choose some other man for a one-off.
  What she definitely hadn't been so keen on, was doing it in a room with lots
  of other people present, even if they were absorbed in the same activity. It
  seemed she didn't have an exhibitionist gene in her body. I had to keep her
  on-side, though. I couldn't let her back out. Not now. Yet she seemed to be
  back-pedalling. I stole a glance at her. She was sitting there with her arms
  aggressively folded - if folding your arms can be an act of aggression - and
  she looked like someone had just squeezed a nipple without permission. I had
  to reassure her, remind her of the attractive aspects of the enterprise, persuade
  her to keep her toys in the pram. 
�Of course not', I said, �you won't have to do anything you really don't want
  to. Look, I know you're a bit nervous about this party. We've neither of us
  been to one before so we don't really know what will happen, but I understand
  from Mike that, to begin with, we will be playing a few games, sexy games with
  the chance to flirt, but just games nevertheless, to get everyone in the mood.
  Nobody's going to ask you to put on a show of fucking, or anything like that.'
  I was running out of oxygen and paused to take a big breath, to let that sink
  in, and to prise my tongue from the roof of my mouth where it had stuck itself.
  I hoped she wouldn't take the opportunity to interrupt. �Mike says you can
  never be sure what will happen when the games are finished; some people may
  just want to talk or they may want to swap. Some may want to use the same room,
  so as to get turned on by watching the other couples at the same time as coupling
  themselves, but equally there are some who like privacy. It is a private house,
  after all. We can do exactly what we want. If at that point you don't want
  to do anything, we can just talk, or we can leave. If there's someone you fancy
  you can find a private room. There's absolutely no expectation or obligation
  for us to do anything, and nobody will worry if we choose to leave.' I had
  to stop again and catch my breath. I stole another glance at her as I was driving.
  She still had a face like sour cream. �Anyway,' I continued, �I thought we
  had agreed to see how it goes and to leave if we don't like the way it's going?
  I'm sure you'd enjoy it if you'd only gave it a chance.' 
�No! I didn't definitely agree to anything,' she replied a little too quickly
  for my liking. �OK, I thought it might be a bit of fun, but now I'm not so
  sure. I've read about these parties on the internet. Yes, I could be interested
  in having another man for a night, but I don't like the idea of people watching.
  Making love should be personal, between one man and one woman. I've read that
  at these parties you have to share rooms with other couples or at least let
  them watch from the doorway, if that's the way they get their rocks off.' 
I was amused that she should use the phrase �making love,' for what she had
  acknowledged would be a one night stand, but I let that go. She didn't need
  any further aggravation. �Look, whatever you've read probably only applied
  to one particular party. Or maybe more than one. But as far as I can make out,'
  I said, and making out was definitely on my mind, �this party, the one we're
  going to, is completely private, and if you want to be private you can be.
  Nobody will force you to let others watch. So if you wanted to get together
  with one of the men, you could do that on your own, in your own room, with
  the door locked. And, if you don't want to take it that far on this occasion,
  that's fine too. We aren't under any pressure. We only have to do what we want
  to do. And the games sure sound like fun.' 
I'd been having some drinks with my friend Mike one afternoon about two weeks
  earlier after a round of golf. Somehow he steered the conversation round to
  women and sex and I could see later, though not at the time, that he'd been
  sounding me out to gauge my attitude to what is commonly referred to as wife-swapping,
  or open marriages if you will. Well, if push came to shove, I'm bound to give
  the impression that I'd welcome some extra-curricular activities, aren't I?
  It's a man thing. Real men take what's on offer, if it's offered. They don't
  wimp out just because they're married. So I must have given the right answers
  because he invited me to a party �for uninhibited adults' that he and his wife
  hold each month at their house. I'd jumped at the chance. There was the small
  problem, however. Mike had made it clear that the invitation was for a couple.
  I was far from sure I could persuade Tracy in time for us to make use of the
  invitation. 
I had started my campaign of gentle persuasion to develop in Tracy some, if
  not enthusiasm for, at least interest in the party, a campaign that had been
  decidedly uphill. I thought it had been successful, until now. I turned into
  a lay-by and stopped the car but kept the engine running. �Look, we're almost
  there now. Can we please call a truce and just go in with the intention of
  enjoying ourselves? Promise we'll leave if it just isn't our scene.' Half a
  smile dashed across her face and was gone in an instant, but it was half a
  smile more than I'd dared hope for. 
I pulled up outside quite a large detached house about two miles outside the
  town in the rolling hills of Wiltshire. I guessed it used to be a farm house
  but that it had been sold off as a family house when it became necessary, in
  the seventies and eighties, for several farms to amalgamate into one to be
  economically viable. I didn't know, but it looked big enough to have five or
  six bedrooms. Or was I just being optimistic? There was a welcoming light in
  the porch. The door was opened by Mike, a middle-aged man wearing a grin and
  holding a gin. �Hello Derek', he said, �Come on in. Take your coats off - it's
  alright you can keep the rest of your clothes on for the moment, ho, ho - and
  chuck them in the study somewhere. You must be Tracy - I'm Mike, glad to meet
  you. Grab yourselves drinks from the kitchen then join the rest of us in the
  front room. You're the last to arrive so we'll be starting the fun and games
  fairly soon.' 
Tracy and I found our way to the kitchen. I poured myself a very large gin
  and tonic. I was still nervous with a stomach like a butterfly nest and wondering
  how the evening would develop, but I knew the gin would help me relax in time.
  Tracy 's face now looked like cream that was beginning to curdle. She asked
  for a white wine. 
�Come on Trace, have something a bit stronger than that!' I said, trying to
  encourage her. �You're not really giving this party a proper chance if you
  don't have something to loosen up and get in the mood.' 
Tracy settled for a sweet Martini and I poured a generous amount into a tumbler.
  I reckoned a cocktail glass wouldn't be enough to shake off her mood and I
  didn't imagine elegance of drinking receptacles was going to be crucial. Clasping
  our drinks, we moved in to the front room. There were about two dozen people
  standing around, talking and drinking, aged, I guessed, between mid twenties
  and late forties. I only knew Mike and his wife Helen. I assumed the others
  were couples but it was impossible to work out which were which, there seemed
  to be many men with their arms around two women and vice versa. This was looking
  very promising, I thought, if the guests were this friendly already. As yet
  I was still too anxious to introduce myself and my unaccustomed trepidation
  was making me even more alarmed, but before I could self-destruct in a pool
  of adrenaline, Mike called the party to order and announced the first game. 
�We're going to play Sex Shop  so you'd all better get seated.' 
Mike turned towards us and said, �We always play games to break the ice. It
  doesn't matter how well people know each other - and most of them are regulars
  - they always seem to be slightly inhibited at the start of an evening, but
  the games always get things moving. Don't worry if you don't know this game.
  You'll soon pick it up - it's very like another game which I'm sure you know,
  but I can't remember the name of.' 
There weren't enough proper seats for everyone and we found ourselves on floor
  cushions next to each other. Tracy positioned herself close to me. I would
  have liked a little more space under the circumstances, a little more independence.
  I would have liked us to project an image of a couple that was cool about being
  apart, but right now she needed her insecurities to be dealt with so I played
  along. Some of the others were sitting on the coffee table and some of the
  women were on men's laps so I guessed it didn't matter too much at this stage. 
�Paula, you start us off please,' said Mike. 
�I went to a sex shop and bought a dildo,' said a woman in a far corner of
  the room who was, presumably, Paula. 
The man next to her then repeated this statement before embellishing it. �I
  went to a sex shop and bought a dildo and a packet of strawberry flavoured
  condoms.' And so the game continued, each player adding more items to the list
  until it came round to me. 
I was having some trouble remembering what everyone had bought but I gave
  it my best shot. �I went to a sex shop and bought a dildo, a packet of strawberry
  flavoured condoms, um, er, oh yes a nipple clamp, a pair of crotchless knickers,
  a bottle of Spanish Fly, an inflatable doll and, lets see, how about a pair
  of handcuffs.' It seemed I'd got it right because at this stage everyone looked
  at Tracy as it was her turn. 
�I went to a sex shop,' Tracy said hesitantly, �and bought a dildo, a packet
  of con... strawberry flavoured condoms, a nipple clamp, a pair of crotchless
  knickers, some Span... no a bottle of Spanish Fly, an inflatable doll, a pair
  of handcuffs aaannnnd a bottle of aspirins'. 
�CHALLENGE!', shouted the man next to Tracy . 
�What's the problem?' Tracy asked perplexed, giving him one of her affronted
  looks. 
�You must add something that you could expect to buy in a sex shop,' he explained. �You
  can't just pick anything. You wouldn't go to a sex shop to buy aspirins! I'm
  sorry but I believe that means you're out of the game and, since you are the
  first one out, you'll have to take a penalty.' 
�Well hold on, perhaps you might want the aspirins because your wife always
  gets headaches in bed', rejoined Tracy , not prepared to be intimidated. 
This caused some amusement amongst the other guests and, after a short debate,
  it was agreed that Tracy 's justification was too good to merit a penalty,
  especially as the game had not been explained to us in advance. The man who
  had challenged Tracy, who we found out was called Jeff, gracefully accepted
  the penalty on her behalf. She looked more than a little grateful, I thought,
  and for the first time she began to look happy, almost as if she were enjoying
  herself. 
�He doesn't do a penalty immediately,' Mike explained to us. �I record penalties
  and prizes throughout the evening and we settle up later on when the games
  are finished.' 
Tracy then started a new round. The game continued with one person being eliminated
  each round when they failed to correctly repeat the list of items, until only
  one person, the winner, was left in the game. She was awarded a prize which
  Mike simply wrote down on his score sheet. 
�Well unless anyone really wants to play that one again I think we'll move
  on to the next game.' 
Mike paused and looked round the room to see if anyone really wanted a re-run
  of Sex Shop . I looked at Tracy . She seemed more relaxed and had
  moved slightly away from me. I didn't know when she had moved but she no longer
  looked like my Siamese twin. She kept stealing glances at Jeff, next to her,
  and he would smile back at her. I suppose he was good looking but I'm no judge.
  I got a sudden unexpected shock of jealousy, like a knife through my heart,
  when I saw him smiling. He clearly wasn't smiling at anything funny. I gulped
  some more G&amp;T. When nobody spoke up for Sex Shop , Mike said, �OK
  lets play Get screwed . Who wants to go out the room first?' 
Someone called Stewart volunteered and duly left the room. Mike looked at
  Tracy and me and said, �OK, this is quite simple really. We'll pick a word,
  in fact a verb to be precise, and Stewart has to guess the word after only
  20 questions. He asks questions about the unknown word but he always substitutes
  the word �screw' for the unknown word. You'll soon see how it works.' 
Then turning to the rest of the room, �Well what's the word?' 
�How about �study'?' said a woman who was on her own as was presumably Stewart's
  partner. 
�OK, that's a good one,' said Mike who proceeded to fetch Stewart back into
  the room. Stewart then began to ask his questions. 
�Have I screwed today?' he asked. They looked at his partner who said �No.' 
�Have I ever screwed?' �Yes,' they all replied. 
�Do I screw on my own?' This got a mixture of �yes', �probably' and �don't
  know'. 
�Have I screwed with anyone else?' This got the same mixed response. 
�Does screwing need special equipment?' Some of the people laughed briefly
  at this question, and it was decided after discussion that the proper answer
  was �No.' 
�Would I go to a special room to screw?' Shouts of �Yes' and �Probably.' 
�Is screwing dangerous?' �No.' 
�Is screwing exciting?' �No.' 
And so the questions went on. After his twenty questions, Stewart eventually
  opted for �sleep' and collected a penalty for being incorrect. Everyone got
  a chance to leave the room and most of us ended up with penalties. I managed
  to guess my word correctly and won a prize. I happened to ask if screwing would
  be dangerous for my health and one clever dick, foolishly trying to be funny,
  said �only according to the words on the packet.' This indiscreet comment was
  not popular with the others who had simply said �Yes' and a few more carefully
  aimed questions allowed me to confidently guess that the word was �smoke.' 
It doesn't sound like a very exciting game - you had to be there, I guess.
  Listening to pretty women asking silly questions about screwing had a strange
  liberating effect on me and made me believe anything might be possible later
  on. None of them had exchanged serious eye contact with me yet but a couple
  had honoured me with friendly smiles, so I had to assume my face didn't look
  like the way I felt, and at last the butterflies were dispersing slowly. 
At the end of the game, Mike announced that we were going to play Pass
    the Host  and this raised an expectant buzz around the whole room. �But
    first, we'll all get another drink while I explain the game quickly to Derek
    and Tracy.' As the others went to the kitchen to refill their glasses, Jeff
    gave Tracy an I'll-be-back smile which still made me uncomfortable. Mike
    explained the game to us. �This is our version of pass the parcel. I'll go
    first which means that I stand in the middle of the room and I am playing
    with the ladies. Helen will control the music without looking at the room.
    The ladies have a vibrator in their hand which they keep passing to their
    left until the music stops. When the music stops, the lady with the vibrator
    in her hand has to ask me to take off one item of clothing. It must be possible
    to remove the item without taking anything else off first. I have two pieces
    of paper somewhere on my body one saying �penalty' and one �prize'. If one
    of them is attached to the item of clothing I take off then she gets either
    the penalty or the prize. When both pieces of paper have been revealed, the
    game is over and it's Helen's turn to stand in the middle, playing with the
    men, while I control the music.' 
I dashed out to the kitchen and refilled my glass with another large gin and
  tonic and also put a large slug of Martini in Tracy 's glass. I was just beginning
  to feel a little light headed, I noticed that the floor wasn't always where
  my foot expected it to be and I certainly wanted Tracy to lose her inhibitions
  as soon as possible. So far she hadn't objected to anything, seemed to be enjoying
  the games and it seemed to me she was definitely flirting with Jeff, which
  filled me with unexpected jealousy and hope that this would work out, all rolled
  into one. Maybe the scene in the car had just been a storm in a D cup. 
Before the game started, Mike handed the vibrator it to Tracy . It was one
  of those ultra-realistic ones, which looked like a cock from a well hung native
  African. She looked at it as if she'd never seen one before and then she pulled
  a wry grin at me. I hope she wasn't thinking that all blacks are equipped like
  that. It's a myth after all, isn't it? As the music started, she passed it
  to the woman on her left. When the music stopped the vibrator had got to a
  very randy looking blonde who, I guessed, would have been anybody's after two
  drinks, so I was not surprised to hear her nominate Mike's trousers. 
�Unfortunately, the legs on these trousers are quite narrow at the bottom,'
  said Mike, �and I cannot get them over my shoes. You'll have to nominate something
  else.' 
She settled for his pullover, which Mike took off but it did not yield any
  paper. The music restarted, the vibrator resumed its travels until the music
  stopped and the woman holding it nominated Mike's left shoe. This again revealed
  nothing. Next time the music stopped he had to remove his right shoe, but again
  no paper. Then, not to anyone's surprise, the next item of clothing that Mike
  had to remove was his trousers. The woman with the vibrator was obviously disappointed
  that no paper fell to the floor along with Mike's trousers. �What about the
  pockets?' she asked. So Mike turned all the pockets out, but still no paper.
  I could not help noticing that Mike was sporting a significant bulge in his
  underpants, but it didn't look the right shape to have been caused by an erection
  and I guessed Mike must be quite well endowed. I wasn't sure I wanted to find
  out just how well. 
The fourth time the music stopped, Tracy was holding the vibrator again. By
  now, Mike was standing in his shirt, underpants and socks and neither of the
  pieces of paper had been found. I thought it was time she escaped from any
  remaining inhibitions so I leant over and whispered in her ear, �I bet you
  wouldn't dare to go for his underpants and see what he's got there,' at which
  Tracy blushed and whispered back, �Oh no? And why not? I'd bet that you're
  the one who'd lose out if I got to compare his assets with yours! Anyway, I
  don't think that's where he would have put the prize, it's too obvious.' 
Tracy opted for Mike's left sock and as Mike took it off he turned it upside
  down, shook it and out fell a piece of paper. 
�Well let's see what Tracy has got,' said Mike unfolding the paper for all
  to see that it had PRIZE written on it. Tracy turned to me and gave me an I-told-you-so
  grin. 
The next woman after Tracy to be left holding the vibrator chose Mike's underpants.
  Mike treated her, and the rest of the guests, to a slow strip tease. First,
  he slid his underpants slowly over his hips but without revealing his family
  jewels. He turned round to show everyone that there was no sign of any paper
  yet. Then he slid the front down revealing a very good sized cock with supporting
  cast. So what? Lots of cocks look big when flaccid but don't deliver the goods
  when they're erect, I said to myself. I felt a little better, but only a little.
  Again he pivoted round to show that there was no paper to be seen. The women
  by this time were cat-calling and telling him to get them off. Finally, he
  slid the pants about halfway down his thighs and then reached into them to
  take out a piece of paper - the penalty. I'm sure Tracy was dying to give me
  an even more pointed grin, but I studiously avoided looking at her and giving
  her that satisfaction. 
Helen walked into the centre of the room and Mike walked over to the hi-fi.
  Tracy noticed that Mike slipped his underpants right off. �You would have thought
  he would have put some of his clothes back on wouldn't you?' Tracy commented
  to me. 
�Maybe he will after the game is finished', I replied, but I suspected that
  this was the beginning of a general disrobing. 
Helen was wearing a smart trouser suit and the men now had their turn to find
  the pieces of paper by getting her to strip. �Perhaps I'd better just confirm
  that I can't get my trousers off over my shoes either,' said Helen before the
  music started. The first two men chose Helen's shoes which did not reveal any
  paper. Whether this was deliberately done so as to allow the following selections
  to be from a wider choice or whether the men simply went for what they thought
  were low risk options was not clear. In any event the next man asked her to
  remove her trousers. Helen slipped them off and then did not wait to be asked
  but simply turned all the pockets out to show there was no paper. Underneath,
  she was wearing tights and through the tights could be seen a pair of lacy
  knickers. There was no obvious sign of any paper to be seen through the tights
  but I didn't know how cleverly it might have been hidden. All the same, when
  the music stopped, the man with the vibrator presumably also didn't think the
  tights were concealing any paper for he chose the jacket. Helen took off her
  jacket and once again showed all the pockets empty. Helen could now be seen
  to be wearing tights with knickers underneath, and a blouse. It looked as if
  she was not wearing a bra because the shape of her aroused nipples could be
  seen quite clearly underneath the blouse. 
Once again the music played for a short space of time and then Helen was asked
  to remove her blouse. Before removing it she reached into the turn-down collar
  and pulled out a piece of paper. 
�Well, Andrew,' she said, �you've certainly got something but I'll just slip
  out of my blouse before we look.' 
As the blouse came off, Helen could be seen to be wearing a special bra with
  cut-outs for the nipples to poke through. Well, I thought, that certainly fooled
  me. Helen opened the paper to show that it had the word PENALTY written on
  it. 
�Sorry about that Andrew, rather a poor reward for being gentlemanly and choosing
  the most innocuous item. But as you know, we always randomise the locations
  before we start,' said Helen. Mike hadn't explained about the locations being
  randomised. I wondered about pointing out to Tracy the flaw in her reasoning
  as to why she hadn't chosen Mike's underpants, but decided that, since she'd
  ended up with a prize anyway, I'd be wasting my time. 
Next it was the turn of Helen's tights but no paper had been hidden there.
  I found myself holding the vibrator when the music next stopped and I looked
  at Helen wearing only her bra and knickers. Now it was Tracy 's turn to taunt
  me but I quickly decided that I was going to make sure of a reward, one way
  or other and announced that I wanted Helen to take off her knickers. Even if
  the paper wasn't there, I reasoned, I would at least catch a glimpse of her
  pussy. Helen too decided to provide a bit of a strip show with her knickers,
  slowly easing them over her hips, then moving the elastic at the back right
  down to crotch level and slowly turning round giving a beautiful view to all
  the guests of her shapely buttocks. Then she lowered the elastic at the front
  revealing that her hair had been partially shaved leaving just a small heart
  shaped patch. Finally she turned her back to me and bent forwards so that as
  she slid the knickers down her legs, she gave me, in particular, a wonderful
  view of her shaved cunt. While bent down to step out of them, she took the
  second piece of paper from the gusset of the knickers as they lay on the floor. 
Immediately, all the other guests got up and started removing their own clothes,
  except Tracy and I who watched rather puzzled. Mike hurried over, �Oh look,
  I'm sorry, I obviously forgot to explain that when this game finishes, all
  the guests have to get undressed until they're in the same state of dress or
  undress as Helen and I, so that means, Derek, that you take everything off
  except your right sock and shirt and Tracy takes everything off except her
  bra. Assuming you're wearing one, of course,' he said turning to Tracy . �Don't
  worry though, it won't be long before you have them all off .' 
�I think we'd better go', Tracy said sotto voce. 
�Oh come on! It's just getting undressed that's all. It's not so much different
  from going to the golf club sauna after all,' I whispered back. 
�That's what you think, is it? Well I think this is bound just to be the start
  of it and I'd rather leave before it goes too far. Before long it's just going
  to be one big orgy.' 
�Come on! We agreed to give it a try and it hasn't gone too far yet, you just
  said so yourself that it's only the start. We're still playing games.' 
�Get real! They want everyone undressed so they can ogle each other and then
  it will be touching up and then it will be fucking.' 
�How can you know that?' God, I thought, I hope she's right! �It's just a
  bit of harmless fun. It's just like being on the beach in the south of France
  ! Anyway, ogling is not groping.' 
�Well, OK. But I'm not completely happy about this and I'm not letting anyone
  maul me just because I don't have anything on'. I noticed, though, that she
  had a good stare at Jeff. He looked as if he had the wherewithal to more than
  satisfy Tracy later on. This was like walking a tightrope though. We were slowly
  inching our way to the promised land but one false move and Tracy would fall
  off and lose her cool. I had to keep her balanced and going forward. I was
  happy if she saw a goal to aim for - Jeff - even if at this stage I hadn't
  found anyone. For once, I had to be patient. 
�How about musical chairs?' asked Mike. This was greeted by general approval
  from the guests who immediately started collecting chairs and lining them up
  in the middle of the room. �This is just like real musical chairs', Mike explained
  to Derek and Tracy. �The men go one way round the chairs in the middle and
  the women go round the other way on the outside of the men. When the music
  stops, the men have to try to sit down on a chair and the ladies have to find
  a lap to sit on. One man and one woman is eliminated each time the music stops.
  Ladies have to sit on the lap facing the gentleman.' 
Tracy looked around the room. The guests were obviously quite excited at the
  prospect of the next game and nearly all the men were now sporting erections.
  I guess it suddenly occurred to her what sitting on a strange lap might be
  like. It had certainly occurred to me what it would be like from the lap's
  point of view and I was already three quarters of the way to sporting a huge
  erection. But Tracy picked up her clothes and made for the door. I hurried
  after her. �What are you doing?' I asked. 
�Were going home. Like I was saying just a moment ago, this is just an excuse
  for the men to grope the women and I don't want any part of it.' We stopped
  in the hallway. 
�Don't be silly, Nobody is going to grope you. You just sit on a lap, that's
  all. What's wrong with that for Christ's sake? Please don't get dressed.' 
�I'm not going to argue about it, Derek. I don't like it. You said we could
  leave if it was over the top and it is, so we're leaving and that's all there
  is to it.' She had sour cream all over her face again. 
�No it's not all there is to it. I don't agree that it's over the top. It's
  just a bit of harmless fun. We said we would stay and see what happened. We
  said we'd play the games and if it progressed to fucking we would leave if
  we didn't want to join in. Well that hasn't happened yet. We're still only
  playing games. Nobody has asked you to fuck in front of them and that's the
  only thing you said you wouldn't do. I'm just getting into this party. It's
  just warming up. If we leave now we'll never know what it was like.' I was
  actually thinking that I'd never know, but I wanted to make Tracy feel she'd
  be missing out too. �We'll leave if it really does get out of hand but not
  before.' I was losing her. Even as we argued she was getting her clothes back
  on. I tried one last desperate gamble. �Who knows, maybe you'll get to sit
  on Jeff's lap.' 
�It's not just harmless body contact! Did you see all those men with their
  stiff cocks. It's obvious that the aim is to press their cocks against the
  women's bodies when they sit down on their laps and as far as I'm concerned
  that is over the top. It's practically fucking. It's not something I'm prepared
  to do in public with everyone looking. And as for your suggestion about Jeff,
  that just shows you also know that this is not about harmless body contact.
  Yes, I quite fancy him, but as I keep saying I'm not doing it in public. Now
  will you take me home?' 
�Hang on, They've obviously played this game before. It's pure chance - the
  result of the previous game - that everyone is practically undressed. They
  must have played this on other occasions when wearing more clothes, so it's
  not just an excuse to grope!' 
�You can't know that,' Tracy said. �Maybe they always arrange for everyone
  to be practically naked by their choice of where to hide those silly bits of
  paper. Now take me home.' 
�No I won't take you home. I want to stay. We agreed we'd stay.' 
�Derek, I am telling you for the last time I am not going to stay. Now please
  take me home like we agreed.' By now she was fully clothed. 
�No. Find yourself a taxi if you really must go. You're the one who's breaking
  the agreement.' 
�Oh very funny, there isn't a taxi rank for miles.' 
�Well then just hitch a lift. I'm sure if you lift your thumb nicely, or better
  still give a quick flash of your fanny, some sex starved madman will stop and
  let you into his car. Then you'll wish you had stayed here for some safe, controlled
  fun.' 
�Fuck you, you bastard', she said as she walked out the front door, �and don't
  think you can sweet-talk me in a couple of days and everything will be forgotten
  because you can't. We're finished.' The door closed. 
I was stunned. How had this got out of hand so quickly? Was it really over
  between us or was it just her big mouth, again? Had I really been so unreasonable
  as to justify her breaking off our relationship? I wondered if I should rush
  after her, but it didn't seem logical. If she was in earnest, then nothing
  I could say now would have any effect, whereas if it was just Tracy 's big
  mouth again, then we'd make up in a few days anyway. It didn't seem there was
  any point in leaving the party just because she was having one of her emotional
  sulks. Mike came out to the hall, �What's going on, we're all ready to start?' 
� Tracy 's gone,' I explained. �She didn't fancy the next game. I think she
  got a sudden and acute attack of prudishness.' Then I remembered that this
  was a couples only party. My heart sank. I'd possibly lost Tracy , and I'd
  have to leave the party anyway. �Sorry Mike, perhaps I'd better go too. This
  will have upset your numbers.' 
�No, no problem Derek. Come back into the room. I'll simply get one of the
  men to sit out the game. Someone with a penalty from an earlier game. Come
  on, I think you'll like this game. It's one of my favourites.' 
I was still in a state of shock by Tracy 's sudden and venomous departure,
  but I'd looked forward to this evening too much to just abandon it. I didn't
  really believe Tracy . We'd had arguments before and the more I thought about
  it the more I believed we'd make up in a couple of days and it would all be
  history. I determined to put it out of my mind and to enjoy what was left of
  the evening. 
It turned out that Tracy 's premonition about the game had been rather accurate.
  Musical chairs turned out to be one of the raunchiest games we played that
  evening. The music played and I went round the chairs while the women were
  circulating in the opposite direction then, when it stopped, I grabbed a chair
  and some woman would land on my lap. I had no choice in who this was, which
  was part of the excitement, I guess. I'd never had women thrust themselves
  at me before, I'd always chased them - chosen someone I fancied and made a
  play for them. But in this game, virtually naked women, some I fancied and
  some I was only mildly turned on by, landed on my lap looking hot and flushed.
  I don't remember why there was such a long pause while the women sat on the
  men, my recollection of musical chair as a child was that someone would be
  eliminated from the game and it would restart almost immediately. I guess it
  was just to give the players some fun time. 
At one point the randy looking blonde plopped down on my lap neatly impaling
  herself on my stiff cock. This took me by surprise - a pleasant surprise I
  have to admit - but nevertheless a surprise. I didn't actually think it could
  have been done without using hands to guide the entrance, but she must have
  practiced, was all I could think. I tried to look around at the other players
  to see if any of them had gone this far, or if anyone had noticed her manoeuvre
  and was looking at us, but the blonde grabbed my chin with her hand and turned
  my head back to look at her. She had sexy eyes, so deep, so devouring and she
  demanded my full attention. Once she had it, she started squeezing and relaxing
  her muscles, sending my cock towards nirvana. So I kept looking at her, our
  eyes locked, our mouths just an inch apart defying the necessity to kiss until,
  regretfully, the music restarted. Then she gave me a quick peck on the lips
  before she rose and we went our separate ways. 
Quite apart from the obvious sexual stimulation, I liked the game for its
  amusement value. The sight of all those men running round the chairs wearing
  just one sock and a shirt with their erections flapping in front of them was
  one of the funniest sights I had ever witnessed. As the game progressed, the
  alcohol began to make serious inroads into my brain. I found I was suddenly
  completely and utterly unconcerned by my own nakedness and the display of my
  own sexual excitement to the assembled party goers. I no longer cared that
  some of the men were clearly bigger than me. Round and round the chairs I went
  until the music stopped and I always just had time to plant my arse on a chair
  before some new woman landed on top of me. Whether they wanted to be shy or
  not, they had no option but to spread their legs and jump onto my lap. This
  was the best ice-breaker yet. I would always make some complimentary comment
  to put them at ease - nice legs, nice tits, great body - well you have to say
  something. Unless that is your cock has become buried deep within her, when
  words no longer matter. But that only happened the once. 
The music would start again and it'd be back to the old rotation. Before I
  really realised, I found I was the only man sitting on a chair with the randy
  blonde once again on top of me. This time thankfully, since all eyes were on
  us, she refrained from engaging me in another close encounter, so to speak.
  We had won the game and I had picked up my second prize. Mike suggested that
  we all get a drinks refill before the next game. I was vaguely aware that somewhere
  a phone rang and was answered. I returned to the room with a full glass and
  looked around for the sexy blonde, but I couldn't see her. I wanted to reserve
  my place for later, though I wasn't sure about the etiquette. I definitely
  wanted more of her. She must have still been in the kitchen, though, which
  was packed with naked bodies searching for new supplies of alcohol. Well, I
  think that's what they were doing. Maybe I shouldn't be so task focussed -
  go in, get drink, come out. Perhaps I should have lingered more. 
Events were now becoming a blur. I no longer felt the bruises when I bumped
  into furniture. The floor of Mike's house developed unexplainable irregularities
  that made it impossible to walk normally or to stand still. Instead, to have
  a conversation with someone each of us had to keep moving backwards and forwards
  like acrobats on stilts. Everyone was completely naked but I had no recollection
  of how or when we'd shed our remaining articles. The women's bodies became
  irresistibly attracted to my body, like magnets, so that we'd crash into each
  other, whereupon the momentum of our hands would cause them to land on each
  other's private parts and then we'd fall about laughing. 
Still, I can just remember the next game. It was called Blind Buff Man or
  something like that. It began with the blonde in the middle of a circle formed
  by all the men. All the men had their hands behind their backs. She was blindfolded
  and turned round and round until she was thoroughly disorientated. She was
  then told to choose a man by walking slowly in some direction with her hands
  behind her back until she made contact. I was disappointed that she was not
  walking in my direction. I was already beginning to feel jealous of any other
  man who got her attention. When she arrived at the edge of the circle of men,
  she made contact with a definite but soft bump as a result of the combined
  effects of intoxication and of her soft curves. She moved herself up and down
  over his body but was not allowed to use her hands. She kissed him lightly
  on the lips then used her mouth to feel his whole body. After two minutes of
  this exploration, she had to guess who it was. She was unsuccessful. The man
  she had blindly chosen then went into a circle formed by all the women and
  he similarly had to choose a woman and guess who it was. I remember that, at
  some point, Mike's wife Helen, correctly guessed the man she was rubbing against
  and not only was she awarded a prize, as noted on Mike's list, but a second
  turn in the middle. 
I don't remember how it worked but I know it was arranged so that everyone
  eventually got a turn in the middle. When it was my turn to be in the middle,
  I must have got very lucky. He found myself pressed up against a warm soft
  body, my cock pressed against the rough texture of pubic hair. I was so drunk
  I no longer cared what anybody saw me doing - I would have positioned it somewhere
  more exciting except that without the use of my hands I knew it would have
  been quite impossible. I kissed the mystery woman and moved down to suck her
  nipples. Then further down to crotch level to smell her there. I love the smell
  of a woman's pussy especially when it is aroused as this one was. I wondered
  if I could lick her, but she had her legs firmly together and the hair was
  abrasive on my tongue, like wire wool. I wondered how I was supposed to identify
  a strange woman while blindfolded, especially since the one woman I might have
  been expected to recognise had stomped off in a sulk. But there was something
  that seemed familiar about this woman. I stood up again. Perhaps it was the
  perfume, or her lips. Something stirred a recent memory. My time was up and
  I had to guess. There was only one other woman I'd become faintly familiar
  with. 
�I'm sorry, I don't know people's names,' I said, �but I think it is the lady
  with blonde hair,' I said. It was indeed her, and I was awarded a prize and
  a second go. 
More drink. I don't understand how that's possible but after a certain point
  drink no longer seems to have any effect. It passes the lips but I don't feel
  it land in my stomach and I don't seem to get any more drunk. Bodies were now
  pressing very close together in the kitchen. Stiff cocks colliding with bodies.
  I no longer freaked out if I contacted someone's erection. Back to the front
  room for another game where we formed into couples. Mike described various
  strange postures that the couples had to adopt. The postures started off quite
  simple, like giving each other a bear hug, then became more complex. I particularly
  remembered one of these poses. She and I had to face each other while I had
  to put my left arm through her legs and hold her right hand behind her back
  while she had her left arm through my legs and holding my right hand behind
  my back. I remembered it not only because it was very erotic with all that
  close groin contact but also because it was bloody difficult, after so much
  booze, first to get into the posture and second not to fall over. After each
  round we had to form new couples. Only a hazy recollection of other poses survived
  my inebriation; my cock held by warm thighs, faces pressed into sweaty buttocks,
  toes getting wet in hot groins. Anyway, the game was that, having first rehearsed
  the position under Mike's expert guidance, the men and women separated and
  moved round in contra-rotating circles with yet more music playing waiting
  for it to stop. Then, not only did you have to find your partner, who might
  be anywhere, but you had to get back into the rehearsed position. I found very
  quickly that the best technique was to drag my partner to the edge of the room
  and out of the confusion that everyone else was creating in the middle. We
  then had space to get into whatever pose Mike had dreamt up. Meanwhile, all
  the other players were in a tangled mess of bodies, unable to adopt the simplest
  of poses. I confess that towards the end of the game, I wondered if it would
  have been more fun to stay with the writhing bodies. Perhaps I was too competitive?
  It had always been a problem of mine and it was true that I were nearly always
  winning the prize, but was I also winning from the point of view of having
  fun? I'd had too much drink to be able to work it out. 
Suddenly the games were over. Mike went to look at the prize and penalty scores
  and to my surprise it turned out that I was the man who had won most prizes. 
�This means you get the special prize,' said Mike. �You'll really like this,
  just follow Helen.' I was beyond hesitation then. There was nothing I could
  do but follow. I would have liked to know what my special prize would be, but
  I was very happy to be led away by Helen, the naked, sexy Helen who had given
  me a special, private view of her shaved cunt when we were playing Pass
  the Vibrator or whatever the game was called, for that was the way to
  discover my prize. My special prize, whatever it was, and I did want to find
  out what it was. Helen took my hand and lead me away into a bedroom. There
  was a four poster bed in the room. I wondered if she was the special prize
  and whether I should take her now in a manly way, showing her who was boss.
  But I was instructed to lie down on the bed, so I did. 
�Don't be alarmed,' Helen said to me sweetly, �I'm going to tie you to the
  bed and you'll find out why in a moment. This is going to be very exciting
  for you.' 
I'd never been tied to a bed before. Within no time at all, it seemed, I was
  tied spread-eagled to the bed, one wrist firmly tied to each of the posts at
  the head of the bed and one ankle firmly tied to each of the posts at the foot
  of the bed. I hadn't struggled. Helen had somehow made it all seem innocuous
  and I couldn't have struggled in my inebriated state even if I'd wanted to.
  I'd just lain on the bed enjoying the touch of her hands as she took my limbs
  and moved them into position then gently tied them there. She'd been almost
  professional, detached. I felt a tremendous mixture of anticipation, excitement,
  fear, vulnerability and puzzlement. Perhaps everyone does, the first time they
  are tied up naked like that. Her face swam in front of mine one last time. 
�Now I'm going to blindfold you,' she continued, �and I have to make sure
  you cannot see because in a moment you will be visited by some of the ladies
  and it is essential for your enjoyment that you don't know who they are. That
  is all part of the fun of this prize as I'm sure you'll find out very soon.'
  Everything went dark as the blindfold covered my eyes. �Mike will be sorting
  out those ladies with the most penalties and they will be coming in here to
  pleasure you for four minutes each. It is essential that you do not talk to
  them and they do not talk to you otherwise you recognise who they are and,
  believe me, that would spoil the treat. The only sound you should hear will
  be the knock on the door when the four minutes are up.' 
By now, I could not see anything nor could I move at all. I was lying there
  spread wide, immobilized, at the mercy of anyone who was in the same room.
  The last image of Helen's face was still impressed on my brain. She looked
  kind but also something else. What? Sad? Apologetic? Regretful? I heard Helen
  leave the room. Perhaps she knew she wouldn't be one of the ladies that would
  be treating me and having seen me on the bed at her mercy she wished she could
  have been. I didn't know why else she might feel depressed. I heard somebody
  come in. I listened hard for any clues as to what was happening but the thick
  pile carpet meant that there was no noise. The next thing I was aware of was
  somebody joining me on the bed - the mattress moved down with the added weight.
  I felt warm smooth skin next to the side of my body, waist high. Then I felt
  warm skin on the other side of my body as if someone was straddling me. My
  cock was picked up by a warm hand and without further ado I recognised the
  unmistakable sensation of a sexually excited cunt enveloping my cock. It was
  incredible, some woman, and I had absolutely no idea who, was screwing me.
  My mind raced with the possibilities. My cock throbbed with the sensual stimulation
  of the anonymous body sliding slowly up and down its length. There was no sound
  except the occasional, characteristic, wet sound of sex. Now I thought I realised
  what Helen had meant - this would not have been anything like as exciting if
  I'd known the identity of the lady who was screwing me; her very anonymity
  assured an added frisson, the ultimate male fantasy of a �no commitment' fuck.
  Too soon I heard a knock on the door and a second later my cock flopped wetly
  onto my abdomen as my phantom lover retreated from the room. 
Five more times this scenario was repeated. Six times in total an anonymous
  lady sank my cock to the hilt in her warm moistness. Six times I wondered at
  the subtle differences of texture I enjoyed as the intimate embrace rode up
  and down my shaft. And then, just as I was going to reach my climax with my
  sixth encounter, there came the knock at the door and my sixth anonymous lover
  left me alone. There seemed to be a longer pause this time and I began to wonder
  if the prize was now finished, but then I heard the door open and, for a seventh
  time, somebody entered the room. �How many more?' I wondered. I realised that
  the next four minutes of screwing would finish me off and I would not be able
  to avoid coming, whether there were further women queuing up or not. I began
  to think it would be rather a shame if I couldn't manage all the women that
  Mike had lined up for me. 
�Hello Derek. Well you do look a sight.' 
My blood ran cold. I seemed to sober up in a millisecond. I recognised the
  voice immediately. It was Jenny. What the fucking hell was she doing here? 
I am so sorry. I think I owe you an apology. You've probably been reading
  the story thus far under a misapprehension, a false premise, an unsafe assumption.
  You see, Jenny is my wife. Tracy ? She's just some fun on the side. I really
  hadn't thought for a minute that Jenny would turn up at the party so it didn't
  seem necessary to explain to you exactly who Tracy is. It seemed a harmless
  subterfuge to allow you to assume she was my wife because it avoided what I
  expected to be an unnecessary explanation. But Jenny's sudden appearance has
  not only caused me considerable consternation but has also made it necessary
  to come clean with you about Tracy's status, and, well, the poor state of my
  marriage. How embarrassing! 
The fact is I've been married to Jenny for fourteen years and inevitably over
  those fourteen years we've become completely familiar with each other, and
  our sex life has become mediocre. We still have sex but not very often and
  there doesn't seem to be anything I can do to surprise or excite her, and vice
  versa. So when we do have sex it isn't particularly satisfying. I did try my
  best to add some excitement to our bedroom but it didn't seem to work. I even
  suggested to Jenny attending a swinging party, like the one I was now at, but
  she had no inclination to participate. I've realised for a long time that Jenny
  is not one of those women who have the imagination or interest to make that
  special effort to find ways of making sex interesting; maybe it is because
  she's usually tired out by her long hours of surgery at the hospital, or maybe
  it's because, deep down, she simply isn't that interested in sex. Whatever
  the reason, I &nbsp;gave up trying, and I found a mistress, Tracy,
  five months ago. 
When I first started having sex with Tracy , it was incredibly exciting. There
  was not only the excitement of a new conquest but also the excitement of knowing
  that I was misbehaving and getting away with it. It was like the excitement
  of having sex when I was a teenager and believing that if my parents found
  out I'd be in deep, deep trouble. Jenny seemed to have been grateful for the
  decreased attention from me since I no longer pestered her for sex on a regular
  basis, so there wasn't even any challenge in keeping the affair secret from
  her. She hardly seemed to notice that I happily went to sleep, apparently unsatisfied,
  and most nights she still got home from the hospital so late that I was home
  before her. On the odd occasion that she was home first, she accepted my explanation
  of working late at the office. I sometimes wondered if Jenny would have noticed,
  or even cared, if I had come home one evening with lipstick on my cock. But,
  of course, it didn't take long for the newness of the relationship with Tracy
  to pale. That was when the old yearning to experience an orgy returned. I needed
  that something extra to satisfy my craving for sexual excitement which was
  why I'd persuaded her to go to the party with me. But back to the party proper. 
There was no mistaking Jenny's voice. I couldn't imagine what she was doing
  here. How long had she been here? I hadn't seen her downstairs and I couldn't
  imagine her being there under any circumstances and especially not in an elaborate
  disguise. How much did she know? I was instantaneously afflicted by limpness. 
�Wha..' I couldn't think what to say, what to ask. 
�I must say you look remarkably harmless on that bed, laid out like a dissection
  specimen. What's happened to your cock all of a sudden, darling? Have you lost
  the desire to screw? I don't imagine you'd normally do that when there's pussy
  around. No matter, are you comfortable?' Jenny removed my blindfold. I found
  my tongue at last. 
�What are you doing here?' I croaked in a squeaky voice that surprised even
  me. 
�Ah, yes, I thought you'd be wondering about that. Well, I received a most
  interesting phone call from your friend, Tracy. She told me all about your
  little liaison, which didn't please me, and about this party here and what
  she thought was going to happen, which pleased me even less. But she also told
  me how you'd broken your promise to leave with her and how you made her to
  get a taxi on her own. She told me all this because she thought I ought to
  know what sort of bastard I'm married to.' 
What a traitor, I thought to myself. Well I'm glad I won't be seeing Tracy
  again. I might be tempted to strangle her. I could see now, in hindsight, that
  she'd obviously been much more upset than I'd realised. Obviously we wouldn't
  be patching things up again after this. I had to think fast. I decided to deny
  it all. �Look, I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know what that
  bitch said to you but it was obviously all lies. This is not what you think.
  I thought this was an ordinary party And Mike asked me to bring his friend
  along, Tracy , to make the numbers balance. We were all having some harmless
  fun but they suddenly they tied me up and took my clothes off. I couldn't stop
  them. I can explain it all but not tied up like this; I feel ridiculous. Would
  you untie me please?' 
�You'll have to do better than that, Derek. You see, I've been here quite
  a while and I even saw you playing some of the games downstairs but you were
  too absorbed in your fun to notice me. Anyway, what you said was illogical.
  How could they remove your clothes after tying you up? It's not possible.'
  Far from untying me she was actually moving round the bed, tightening my restraints
  so that I couldn't move at all. Not a fraction of an inch was available to
  my hands or legs. �But I don't have to apply logic because I know exactly how
  much resistance you showed to being tied up on this bed. None, to be precise.
  And I know just how many clothes you were wearing when you were tied up. None,
  to be precise. And I saw exactly how much objection you raised to the treatment
  you've been receiving from the ladies for the last half hour. None, to be precise.' 
This was really bad news. �You mean you've been in the room watching?' I couldn't
  believe it but I had to ask. I was beginning to seriously worry. Jenny had
  this calm, almost friendly, voice with which she was talking to me, but I was
  sure deep down she must be very angry. Especially if she'd seen what had happened
  in the room. Her face wasn't friendly, for sure. I couldn't sort out in my
  mind what was going on. 
�Oh, yes,' she confirmed. �But that is not the whole picture. You see, I've
  done better than that, my darling. I was one of the six ladies who pampered
  your cock while you've been tied to the bed.' 
At this point I saw Jenny open her medical bag and take out what looked like
  black thread. Jenny walked over and started to wrap the thread very tightly
  around the top of my scrotum where it emerged from my groin. It was fucking
  painful, let me tell you. 
�Ow, what the bloody hell are you doing. That hurts!' I was in real agony,
  let me assure you. 
�Well, I'm not very bothered that it hurts Derek,' came that worryingly calm
  voice again, �and I'm not at all surprised. It's just a bit of surgical ligature.
  I'm tying off your balls in order to stop the blood circulation, so it has
  to be tight. I hate unnecessary loss of blood. All surgeons do.' I wondered
  through the pain what she was babbling on about. Cutting off the blood? Was
  she mad? �You see, we're going to play a little game once, I've got this secure.' 
Jenny tied the loose ends of the ligature and stepped back. My balls hurt
  like hell. It felt like she'd tied the ligature so tight it would cut my balls
  right off, not just the blood flow. Now I understood the voice. This was the
  calm professional doctor showing through, detached, unemotional. But I didn't
  need a doctor. Every bit of me had been working fine. 
�There,' she said with satisfaction. �Now it's a bit like Russian Roulette,
  this game we're going to play, except that in Russian Roulette you have a one
  in six chance of an unhappy ending while, in this game, if you were to play
  it by pure chance and not by skill, that is, you only have a one in six chance
  of avoiding an unhappy ending. As I said, I was one of the six ladies who came
  to you and gave you a four minute screw. All you have to do is identify which
  one of those six was me. I'm sure you should have been able to recognise your
  own wife, so this ought to be a very simple and easy! However, like all the
  other games you've been playing, if you lose, you get a penalty. In this game,
  if by any chance you should fail to correctly work out which one of the six
  ladies was me, I shall be so deeply insulted, so mortally offended, that I'll
  have no option but to castrate you.' She walked back to her medical bag while
  she continued to talk. �It's the only revenge I can think of that's severe
  enough to restore my self esteem.' I think my eyes stuck out on stalks and
  I noticed an evil grin appear for the first time on Jenny's face. �That's right,
  I'll use this scalpel,' by now she was holding a small shiny implement in her
  hand, �to remove your balls and then there will be no more screwing around
  for you, ever. Now you see why I wanted to stop the blood flow. So, you'd better
  think hard before you give me your answer.' 
She was mad, of course. �You're mad,' I screamed at the top of my voice. �You
  wouldn't do that. HELP! HELP ME SOMEBODY! HELP!' 
�You're wasting your breath, Derek. They've all gone. You see, it was a simple
  matter to persuade them, when I rang, that I could inform the police about
  their sordid party and that if I told the police what was going on here then
  the house would certainly be raided. So they agreed to let me join the party
  and devise a fitting punishment for you in return for my silence. Then, when
  I worked out my punishment, I gave them a broad outline of what I was going
  to do, omitting the distasteful details about your final penalty of course,
  and they agreed they would all leave the house after your six screws. I think
  they went off to some motel or other to finish their evening activities. So
  there is absolutely no point in shouting. No point at all. There's nobody in
  the house, except you and me, and the nearest neighbour is too far away to
  hear you even if the house didn't have double glazing.' She looked at me with
  a malevolence I'd never seen before. The eyes bore into me while a thin smile
  emerged from her lips. The emotional detachment I'd noticed earlier had now
  disappeared. She was actually relishing the prospect of mutilating my body.
  I could see clearly that the implement she was now tossing from hand to hand
  was a steel scalpel. She was probably already rehearsing in her mind a swift
  slicing movement to detach my balls from my body. But this was lunacy. This
  couldn't be happening. 
�I don't understand,' I said. �Why are you taking this so personally, You
  haven't shown any interest in sex for the last two years. Why is it such a
  big deal to you that I've come here to this party?' 
�You're so right, and yet so wrong. I've had little interest in having sex
  with you, that's true, but I've been having sex with one of the doctors at
  the hospital, someone who really knows how to use sex to give a woman pleasure.
  I got thoroughly fed up with that selfish way you fuck that always leaves me
  frustrated. No wonder I preferred not to have sex at all than be left like
  that each night. Imagine my surprise when I found out it didn't have to be
  like that, that women can have wonderful orgasms too, provided the man knows
  what he's doing and is sensitive and caring. All these nights you thought I'd
  been working late at the hospital have been the happiest, most fulfilling and
  satisfying of my life.' 
I was stunned. Jenny had been having an affair! What a bitch! �So if you're
  happily having an affair with some doctor, what's the big deal with me?' I
  asked. �Why are you contemplating castrating me?' 
�As you've obviously worked out it isn't really to do with hurt pride. I couldn't
  give a toss about you having sex with another woman. No, I suppose some of
  it is revenge for Tracy . But mostly I want to protect the other women in this
  town from you and your inept love making. Tracy 's never going to see you again,
  but I know that, given the chance, you'll just find some other poor woman and
  disappoint her like you disappoint all the women in your life. I'm being socially
  responsible, you could say. Improving the environment. Working for the common
  good. But I'm not completely heartless. I am giving you every opportunity to
  avoid this unfortunate fate. All you have to do is correctly identify my cunt,
  as it were. If you hadn't been playing away and if you'd treated me properly
  and given me good regular service, you would still remember clearly what I
  felt like. You'd have no problem. It would be the one you know so well. On
  the other hand, your sexual conduct has left you a little at a disadvantage.
  So, my little Casanova, have you thought it over? Are you ready to tell me
  which one of the ladies who visited you was me? You've had a little time to
  think it over while I've been nattering on.' 
She had come to stand close to my groin and was now studying my genitals with
  a disconcerting concentration. �Hang on,' I said, �you said that if I get this
  wrong I get a penalty. Does that mean that, if I get it right, I get a prize?'
  I have no idea why I asked the question as there seemed so little chance I
  would get the question right. I was like a condemned man asking for a final
  cigarette. Anything to put off that awful moment. 
�Yes, of course, how thoughtless of me not to explain. If you guess correctly,
  Derek dear, then your prize is that I don't cut off your balls.' A malicious
  smile landed on her face and she fought like crazy not to let it develop into
  full blown laughter. She was unable to speak for about ten seconds. �Now, have
  you decided on your answer because I really must press you for it now? I don't
  have all night. Oh, just one last little point you ought to consider before
  you tell me. As I'm sure you're aware, I'm not qualified to administer any
  anaesthetics. Only to perform surgical procedures. So if you force me to proceed
  with the operation by refusing to identify me correctly, you will sadly have
  to suffer the full pain of the operation without any analgesic. That should
  be interesting, don't you think? Oh, and I've never done this operation before
  but it can't be that complicated, can it? I'm sure I'll work it out in under,
  oh, two hours? I'm quite looking forward to it in fact. I've often wondered
  what those little objects have in them to make them so precious to a man, and
  so exquisitely sensitive. So I thought I'd do a little exploratory dissection
  on them first, before actually removing them. It wouldn't be the same to dissect
  them after removal. Tissue reacts to dissection quite differently when it is
  still enervated, did you know that? It's so much more fascinating. Now, what's
  your answer? Just give me a number between one and six and I'll do the rest.'
