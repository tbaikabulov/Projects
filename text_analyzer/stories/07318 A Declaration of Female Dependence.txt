Synopsis: 






July, 2009. The White House.

Jenny holds tight to her Blackberry. She is a journalist. She is on special assignment from her newspaper. There, she is a respected co-worker and friend to many. Her palms sweat around the Blackberry. She'll be writing the speech in live-blog chunks. This is not her first Obama speech. She covered the inaguration, and several campaign speeches before the election, before the financial crisis, before Obama began retooling the country to make sure the bankers didn't go broke, to make sure we didn't turn into a Chinese colony. The amount of debt the country was in, it was only a matter of time before America as we knew it had to change. But Jenny didn't know what Obama was about to declare.

Everyone stands as the President Elect is announced. Jenny claps along with the other hundred or so journalists in the room. In a moment, Jenny can see Obama. He looks tall, and confident, like always, but there's something else going on with his expression. She can't place it. Is it...is Obama smirking?

"Good morning, everyone," Obama begins. His voice booms, making everyone immediately silent. He has such immense presence, Jenny can't help but be in awe of the man. She writes in her Blackberry, signaling her website and her readers about this great man's arrival.

Jenny wrote as fast as she could on the little device, her thumbs finding the keys without any effort. Obama spoke: "As you all know, America is facing the toughest economic downturn in its history. The trillion dollar economic stimulus package only made the situation worse, as corrupt CEOs and presidents simply took the money offered to them and left the country, leaving untold insurance and car companies without leaders. The last few months have been incredibly difficult for many out of work Americans. Over twenty percent of the country is now unemployed, with more losing their jobs every day."

Jenny wrote down what he said with blazing accuracy. These talking points weren't knew. The first half of 2009 had been devastating to the country, and many were beginning to blame the young president, with some pundits asking for George Bush back.

"Today, my staff and I propose a staggering new series of concepts that will ensure America's future and rightful place as leader of the free world. This bill has already been passed in congress by a wide 80-20 margin, with both Democrats and Republicans agreeing to the terms herein. That is to say, both Democrat and Republican men have passed the deal."

Jenny stopped writing for a second. What did he mean by 'men'?

"There are three major overhauls to the US constitution and bill of rights we will be discussing today. They will go into effect tomorrow. This is a landmark, historic day, and people will remember it as the day we, your government, saved the country from certain economic peril."

Jenny listened intently. This sounded big, and she was glad she got the tag to be here to see it live.

"The first part of the bill is to legalize Gay marriage across the board. Beginning tomorrow, Gay men across America can be married and receive exactly the same rights as straight men."

The crowd of journalists erupted. This was huge, and everyone wanted a word in. Obama silenced them.

"Please," he said. "There's a lot to go over here. I will answer questions after the briefing."

Everyone begrudgingly sat down. Obama continued, but Jenny quickly thought, "Men. He said men again instead of everyone."

Obama said, "The reasons for allowing Gay men to marry are simple. Throughout the economic downturn, there has been one group of citizens who have not only kept sales up, but report breakout numbers of customer service satisfaction and return business, and that's the population of Gay males. We owe what little money is moving in our country to Gay men, and we are rewarding them with a civil rights victory they have been fighting since this country was conceived. To me, the issue was black and white. There was simply no good reason not to let it happen."

Jenny wrote everything Obama said, word for word, clicking at 50wpm with just her thumbs. This was incredibly historic, and it was just the first point of three!

Once the room had quieted, President Obama reached down below the podium and took out what appeared to be a cigarette. No, not a smoke. A joint. President Obama was holding onto a joint. Someone in the front row gasped. Jenny was shocked, but smiled a little, if this meant what she thought it meant. After legalizing Gay marriage, what else was on the fantasy brains of most Americans?

President Obama lit the joint and took a deep puff with his eyes closed. He slowly let the smoke out and inched towards the microphone. "From tomorrow on, Pot is completely legal in the United States of America."

The room exploded in a series of loud questions, cheers, boos, and all around rabble. Jenny clicks hard on the Blackberry. By now, the blogs and newswires are on fire. Used to be, one had to wait until a speech was over to hear about what happened. By now, there'll be a thousand comments on her site regarding these posts.

President Obama silenced the room again, and continued smoking the joint. "The war on drugs is officially over, at least with regards to this one. Medical studies have shown marijuana to be beneficial to the psyche, and contains fewer addictive substances than cigarettes or alcohol. The downsides of the drug are manageable, as well. A steady routine of exercise and sex from every adult American should ward off any potential side effects of the drug."

Jenny was elated. Her and her boyfriend got high every few weeks, and were always a little paranoid about being caught and fired from their jobs. She felt millions of Americans must have had the same stupid paranoia, but it was all over now. This was amazing news.

Obama put out the joint on the podium. "Now, we have legalized Gay marriage among men, and legalized marijuana for everyone, but these two historic new changes to American policy will not completely turn this country around. We need something much bigger. This third and last new change will completely alter us as a country and immediately change how the world views us."

Jenny clicked away, oblivious to the fact that her place as an American citizen was about to completely change.

President Obama took a deep breath and said, "As of midnight, every single woman in America will have her human rights revoked."

Jenny stopped writing. Did he say what she thought he said?

The room was in the loudest uproar yet. Both men and women were completely outraged at the news. Obama quieted them. "I'm sure you will have many questions regarding this new set of changes to the American way of life. All of the details can be found at change.gov, where everyone can read up just what we mean in every case. I don't have time to go through it all here, so lets just keep it simple. From midnight on, Gay men can marry, pot can be smoked anywhere, and every single American woman is no longer considered human."

Jenny, incapable of staying silent any longer, yelled, "What do you mean, not human anymore? You can't honestly believe that we'll just lay down our rights, do you?"

Obama looked directly at Jenny. His stare was more intimidating than his voice. "I don't know who you are, but let me make this perfectly clear. This decision did not come easily. I had a wife. I had two daughters. I had a lot to lose as well. But it is for the good of the country and the good of the people that this happen. As of midnight, you are no longer a person. Go to change.gov to see exactly what that entails."

Obama stopped for a second, looked down, and said, "Hilary, you can come out of there."

Everyone in the room, Jenny included, stopped short of dropping their jaws to the floor as they watched Secretary of State Hilary Clinton crawl out from the podium. She was dressed just like she normally was in a power suit, but around her neck was a thick leather collar. Attached to the collar was a leash, which was attached to the podium. She wiped her mouth. Obama walked over to her, pet her head, and that's when everyone noticed that his enormous cock was hanging out of his slacks.

He said, "Here's just one example of what women can be used for now, but I have every faith in the American man to come up with lots of other ways to use their women."

Obama placed his cock near Hilary's mouth, grabbed her hair, and forced her mouth on it. Hilary was not happy about her new station, but what could she do? As of midnight, that might be the fate of all American women.

Jenny gasped. She couldn't believe what she'd heard, what she'd seen. She looked up to Clinton. She voted for her in the primary. And as she watched her former idol suck the cock of the new president, all she could do was type. She typed what was happening. She typed what was happening to America, to Clinton, and to women everywhere.

"God Bless America," Obama said, as he came upon Hilary's face, putting away his cock, and forcing Clinton to crawl offstage behind him.










As one could imagine after such a hearing, the entire country was in an uproar. The news hit the airwaves minutes after president Obama declared the three new edicts of the United States. Work ceased. Buses stopped running on time. Panic gripped the populace. Well, some of the populace. Mostly women. Mostly, it was women who went to change.gov to read up on the details of the new laws. Gay men went to the site to make sure what they'd heard--that they could now legally marry anywhere in the country--was actually coming true. Dedicated pot smokers and lobbyists for the drug went to the site to make sure they hadn't imagined the speech in a hazy green dream. But mainly it was women who visited the site in the millions. Like most of the country, Jenny navigated to the site and found three documents on the front page. The first two were details of the reformed marriage and drug laws. The third document was entitled "A Declaration of Female Dependence." 

Jenny had raced home to call in the rest of her report. Her boss, Jacob, could hardly believe the news. "I don't know what's happening," Jacob said. "But I don't care what some law says. You're one of my best reporters and you'll still be one of us tomorrow."

Jenny was relieved to hear protectionist praise from a man in her life, especially the man who signed her paychecks. She didn't entirely know what was going on, but she felt assured in that at least she had her job to hold on to. She wondered aloud to herself what this document could contain, how taking away the rights of women would help with the economic crisis, and why the government would think womankind would take this kind of action lying down. 

Jenny took a deep breath and clicked on the declaration. It took a few seconds to load, but when it did it filled the screen. 

"A Declaration of Female Dependence.

July 2009, from the White House and the United States Government. Written and approved by President-Elect Barack Obama. 

Since the beginning of our great nation, we have always held firm that We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. This edict has proven to be flexible through our history when America has required it to be, be it with African-American slavery, Japanese prison camps, Native American land ownership, and recent presidential races. When faced with difficult decisions, Americans have often shifted the definition of this edit to best fit the answer required for the time. My fellow Americans, this severe economic downturn is another one of those times. We must begin to view these words as literal, and take to heart the most important aspect of the phrase. Remember, forever and always in America, all men are created equal. 

In such downturn in the economy, we must look at ways to cut costs by the billions. Both parties of the government, as well as both congress and the White House have agreed that an entire section of the population must be forced to work for free in order to compensate. Once that decision was made, it was a simple process to decide which class of human would have to make the sacrifice for the greater good.

Women have never been truly equal in American society. They have always been viewed in one way or another, be it financial, sexual, or physical, to be inferior to men. The decision to choose women was an easy one, as we at the government believe the transition from freedom to slavery will be smooth. 

For this process to occur, we have developed a roadmap for both men and women to follow, so that the transition can be as fast and simple as possible. The following rules and guidelines will go into effect at midnight, July 4th. It is a fitting date for a fitting occasion: a new breed of American slavery. Both men and women are expected to follow these rules, and to expect the same of the men and women around them. 

1) Identification of women, including birth certificates, drivers licenses, health cards, etc., should be discarded, as the government records will be destroyed and no form of identification for women will ever hold currency. From here on, the names of women will be handed down by their owners. 

2) Bank accounts, lines of credit, and mortgages held by women will be handed over to the woman's husband, boyfriend, employer, or parent, whichever comes into the proper offices and claims them first. The woman has no right as to who is entitled for such deeds. 

3) Similarly, major property owned by women, including houses, businesses, cars, etc., will be handed over by whichever man claims to own these things first. 

4) Since this revocation of rights is due to economic stimulus, if a woman has any major debt, she will become property of whomever she owes the debt. This includes banks, businesses, professional loaners, insurance agencies, the government, etc. This right-of-ownership supersedes ownership claims by husbands, boyfriends, or parents. 

5) It is expected that women work for a living without pay, and it is expected that the conditions in which they work be of little concern to any man. 

6) It is expected that women will be treated poorly. This is also little cause for concern amongst the lawmakers of this country. 

7) Women will be subservient towards every man in America, and will do whatever is necessary to please them. 

8) As inferred in previous economic rules, women can become property to a male, though ownership is not a requirement of women. Simply because a woman is not owned by a man does not mean she has rights, only that she has little protection in the world and can be claimed by any man at any time. 

9) As women are not considered human, they will from here on be considered animal, and the laws for bestiality will have to be altered to fit the sexual needs of the superior American male. 

10) As women are not considered human, they will need to be trained, much like a cat or a dog, in order to maintain civility in America. 

11) Training guides for the female species will be available from this website and many others, as well as your local post office. 

12) As women are now to be treated like domestic animals, laws for the care of women will be similar to the laws for care of dogs. Men are legally allowed to beat and punish women in the way they see fit. Brutal beatings are discouraged but not illegal. Torture of women is not permitted but prosecution of torture will depend on circumstance. Killing of women is illegal within city limits. 

13) Owned women must wear a symbol of ownership, like a collar, leash, wrist cuffs, hood, or cloak. Men may dress their women as they see fit. 

14) Within two weeks, the law for public nudity and sexual practice will be amended to accommodate the new inferior sex. It will be legal for women to be nude in public, and it will be legal to use women in a sexual way in public. 

15) Without question, there will be both men and women who object to this government mandate. I will assure you all now that you are severely outnumbered, and it is encouraged to physically convince both women and men who believe that this step isn't necessary. Everything will work out much easier for you if you comply peacefully. 

Thank you for reading through the Declaration of Female Dependence, and God Bless America."









There was a car on fire. The smoke billowed up and away, and almost took Jenny&#8217;s attention for a moment too long. If she&#8217;d paid attention to the smoke for another second, she would have been tackled, pushed to the ground by a homeless man. He was hoping to grab her, to hold on until the end of the riot, until he had dragged her home, until she had no hope and no rights and none of the things her life had summed up to this moment. At least, that&#8217;s what she feared. Jenny ran and stopped, ran and stopped. She wanted to get through it best she could, but she could not be helped against witnessing the scene. The riot. The world, changing.

Only 24 hours before, Jenny had sat in her desk at work, her eyes glazing over the details in a meticulous story about arduous politics. Her mind couldn&#8217;t have been further from what she should have been focusing on. In hindsight, in the hindsight of every woman and woman-respecting man in the country, the thing to do yesterday was flee the country. But hindsight was only one of the luxuries being fought for in the streets. To Jenny&#8217;s eye, though, it wasn&#8217;t just women fighting the eager men who wholeheartedly agreed with Obama&#8217;s decree. To Jenny&#8217;s eye, women fought other women, because some of them believed it, too. To Jenny&#8217;s eye, men fought men, as some wanted to protect the world they had against the world as it was evidently going to be. But then again, these battles caught Jenny&#8217;s eye in a certain way. 

She wasn&#8217;t at all sure exactly what was going on, who was fighting who, and how it would all turn out. The only thing she knew was that she needed to get to her friend&#8217;s apartment. She needed to hole up for a while, needed to wait the whole bloody thing out. 

Denise didn&#8217;t live far away, but escaping the clutches of everyone around her proved difficult. On two separate occasions she had kicked off the pilfering hands of untrustworthy men. She didn&#8217;t know if they wanted to rape her or protect her from the madness, but she wasn&#8217;t taking her chances.

Jenny watched a horrifying scene as she ran. To her left was a corner convenience store, and a woman was trying to escape. All Jenny could see was hands, pairs and pairs of hands, reaching out from inside the store, pulling the poor woman back in. Her clothes in taters, her face filled with nothing but fear, the woman was helpless to escape the maw of uncaring hands. 
Jenny cried at the sight of it all. She cried and ran, her boots making no noise against the cacophony of pain, suffering, and resistance. She could see Denise&#8217;s apartment complex. Just a few steps away from the door. 

A coarse male hand pulled at her hair, holding tight to the ponytail. He pulled her entire body back with just his fist, and she was turned to face him. �Bagged another one, gents!� He proclaimed, smiling a crooked, evil smile, staring at her tits and tightening his grip. He had apparently said this to no one, as nobody replied until a second later, when a small chorus of men in the surrounding area pumped their fists and yelled �Whoo!�

�No!� Jenny screamed. She was so close to safety. The fist tightened around her hair, and it hurt like hell. The man eyed her up and down. He was gruff, ugly, tall and stalky and strong enough to hold her without much of a fight. His eyes were drunken. His other hand easily fought away her attempts at escape. He made little effort to keep her in check. 

Jenny began to kick. She tried to land a good shot to the man&#8217;s balls, but she could barely reach. His grip was so solid, she began to think beyond fight or flight to the eventuality that maybe he had her, that she was his now to do with what he wanted. She was taken, trapped, and this nightmare would officially begin. 

Which is exactly why she was so surprised when his perverted gaze turned to one of pained shock, when his grip loosened and let go, and when his torso curled downward, his body falling to the cement sidewalk. One moment he was seconds from raping her, and another he was dead. Jenny saw the gunshot wound on his back, the smoke from the heat of it. She looked up and saw a woman brandishing a large silver gun. She wore a police uniform and she looked dead serious.

�Run,� she said. �I&#8217;ll take care of them.�

Jenny was in shock and could barely move. �Thank...thank�� She muttered.

�Go!!!� The cop screamed. �Get to somewhere safe!�

Jenny obeyed, running up the stairs to Denise&#8217;s apartment. The front door of the building had been busted through, but there was nobody in the stairs. She climbed to the third floor and entered the hallway. 

Jenny quietly walked toward the hallway, hoping to get to the door without any other altercations. To her surprise, she was in front of Denise&#8217;s door before she knew it. She knocked, quietly. She heard no response. On the other end, she could hear breathing, perhaps. Or maybe that was just her own sharp, short breaths. 

After knocking twice more and waiting, she decided to do try the knob. The door opened. It creaked, really. At first she heard nothing, and then a small muffle. She walked through the entranceway and into the living room, where she saw her best friend Denise. Jenny gasped at her condition. Tied to a chair by the legs, her arms tied behind her in a way Jenny couldn&#8217;t see, gagged with what looked like underwear. Her clothes were ripped, and Jenny could see one of Denise&#8217;s breasts. Her head was down, and she breathed slowly through her gagged mouth. 

�Oh my God, Denise!� Jenny exclaimed. �What&#8217;s happened to you?�

Denise raised her head. Her eyes looked tired, but her expression was one of relief, as if whatever had transpired was over now that Jenny had appeared. She would be saved, and everything would be all right. 

Suddenly, however, her eyes widened, and she tried to scream through the muffling of her gag. She tried to jump up and down in her chair. Jenny asked �What is it?� but before she could get it all out, a black hood wrapped around her head. Strong, sturdy hands wrapped around her neck. She couldn&#8217;t fight back. Her nails had no effect. She kicked nothing but open air. Within seconds she couldn&#8217;t think straight, and only seconds after that she couldn&#8217;t breathe. In less than a minute, Jenny was on the ground, her assailant standing over her. He looked towards Denise and smiled. Denise looked down at her friend, and knew that nothing would ever be okay ever again.











There was a car on fire. The smoke billowed up and away, and almost took Jenny&#8217;s attention for a moment too long. If she&#8217;d paid attention to the smoke for another second, she would have been tackled, pushed to the ground by a homeless man.

Denise raised her head. Her eyes looked tired, but her expression was one of relief, as if whatever had transpired was over now that Jenny had appeared. She would be saved, and everything would be all right.

In less than a minute, Jenny was on the ground, her assailant standing over her. He looked towards Denise and smiled. Denise looked down at her friend, and knew that nothing would ever be okay ever again.









It was moments, perhaps longer, that Jenny was out cold. She opened her eyes but saw blackness. Blindfolded. She tried to speak, but her mouth had been gagged with something cloth, maybe of her own. She could hear stomping up and down stairs, cars whirring, screaming. The night was still happening out there. The riots and the fights were still very much the new pulse of the city, of the country. Jenny shook her head to shake the cobwebs. She had a terrible headache. 

Her arms were tied behind her back. She was sitting in a chair, likely a similar chair to the one Denise had been tied to when she came in. Denise&#8217;s boyfriend, the bastard that smacked Jenny out cold, must have tied her up while she was out. Jenny tried to move her legs but couldn&#8217;t. They were tied down tight to the chair legs. 

Jenny heard a chain, a single metal chain, slowly scratching along the floor. She heard whimpers. She could feel weight shifting just to the left of her. 

Jenny forced herself to look down at whatever was making that noise. She heard jingling coming from the form. As the body came into view, Jenny saw a near-naked girl on her knees, connected by the neck to a heavy metal chain. The girl looked up at Jenny. She was young, barely 18 by the looks of her, but her appearance was not that of a normal 18 year old girl. She was short, barely five feet. Her face was bruised in two places, and her back was criss-crossed with marks. Her naked ass was red. The marks looked fresh. This girl had been beaten in the last hour. 

But she looked up at Jenny with hope, still, as if to say that she held the key to figuring out this new space. She was tied in her friends&#8217; apartment, and had been tied by some son of a bitch. Jenny looked around. She and this girl on her knees were the only two in the room. Jenny tried to speak, tried to get the girl to untie her gag. The girl looked like she wanted to help, looked pleadingly like she wanted to help, but forced herself not to. Perhaps this girl had tried to help Denise, and this man had stopped it and physically assaulted her. This man, whoever he was, meant business. 

Jenny looked down at the girl again. The girl smiled meekly, as if to say �Hey, this isn&#8217;t so bad.� Then, out of nowhere, she spoke. 

�I&#8217;m Lori,� she said. 

�Mmph,� Jenny said. 

�You&#8217;re Jenny,� Lori stated. Jenny was surprised by this. How did she know her name?�

�I peeked through your wallet,� Lori said. �It&#8217;s over there, where he threw it after taking the cash.� 

Lori pointed to the couch, where several cards and wallets lay strewn.

�My stuff is over there too, my glasses and my stuff� Lori said. �Not that it matters now.� 

Jenny gave a confused face. What did she mean by that?

Suddenly, Lori cowered behind Jenny&#8217;s chair. �Shit!� She murmured. Jenny heard footsteps. Then, a shadow appeared in the far hall of the apartment. She heard footsteps and something heavy being dragged. 

Then, he appeared. The man who had struck Jenny down, the man who had tied her up, who had beaten the young girl behind her, who had captured Denise and lured Jenny in. 

Fuck, Jenny thought as she saw him. Richard, Denise&#8217;s ex boyfriend. 

�Awake I see,� Richard said, slowly coming into the room. He pulled something heavy behind him on another chain. As the body on the ground came into view, Jenny could see Denise in her new state. Naked and chained and beaten in the same manner as Lori, Denise lay unconscious as she was pulled by the neck into the living room. 

�mmpphh!� Jenny screamed into her gag. The young girl behind her cowered and shivered. 

Richard smiled. �Big time journalist like yourself should know the score by now. I mean, you were there, weren&#8217;t ya? Denise told me you were there when the president threw down. Here,� Richard said, reaching for the television remote on the coffee table. �Lemme show you something.�

The television came on. Richard flicked around. Some stations were just static, others reruns. There wasn&#8217;t much for new content up today, apparently. Richard flicked to CNN. A new male reporter was sitting at the desk. 

The reporter said, �Today is a day we&#8217;ll all remember for a long time, perhaps forever. Today, President Obama stripped away the rights of all women, removing them from their positions as equal citizens of America, and placing them at the feet of the male race. He has done this in order to fix our crumbling economy, but the riots across America have shown the American people may not be ready to transition to this new lifestyle so easily.�

CNN switched to footage of riots, fights, breakouts across the nation. Jenny tried to smile but couldn&#8217;t. She was so proud of her fellow females, and her fellow males who didn&#8217;t support this change. 

�That&#8217;s sweet, ain&#8217;t it?� Richard said. �Y&#8217;all think it ain&#8217;t over. That y&#8217;all ain&#8217;t just cattle now? That&#8217;s a sweet notion. I tell you, I&#8217;ve been waiting for this day ever since this bitch,� Richard pointed down at the unconscious Denise. �Tore my heart to shreds. Saying I abused her and shit.� 

Jenny remembered Richard. He&#8217;d been a grade A asshole to Denise. He hit her on occasion, and was often drunk and nasty. 

�Anyways, I hear the speech yesterday just like everyone else, and I figure the best thing I can do is come right over here and protect my girl, so that she don&#8217;t get hurt by nobody. And lo and behold, here&#8217;s her best friend come to the rescue, &#8216;cept it didn&#8217;t really work out that way, did it?� 

Jenny tried to move in her chair, tried to scream. Richard walked towards her. He stood just a foot away, and reached down with his hand, cupping her face. His hand slowly reached down to her throat. He began to choke her. 

�Here&#8217;s the rules,� he said. �As of today, you don&#8217;t actually have any rights at all, and you&#8217;d better get used to that. You don&#8217;t have a name, a job, a place in this world. You&#8217;re a worthless, rightless being that used to be called a woman. But that word don&#8217;t exist anymore. All you are is a cunt, a whore, a fucktoy, a receptacle. You&#8217;re whatever I want you to be, because I got to you first. Your boyfriend ain&#8217;t never going to see you again. Your boss ain&#8217;t never gonna get another report out of you. You&#8217;re mine, Jenny, and don&#8217;t you forget it.�

Jenny was having trouble breathing. Richard&#8217;s hand gripped harder and harder as he spoke. Tears shot from her wide, scared eyes. 

Richard let go of her throat, and slapped her face incredibly hard. Her head shot to the side and she screamed hard through the gag. 

�You see Lori, my puppy, down there behind you?� Richard said. �You see her marks, her bruises?�

Richard pointed down to Denise. �You see her marks?�

Jenny looked down at Denise, and noticed the same markings on her back, the same bruises on her face. 

�That&#8217;s how I like my girls to look,� Richard said. �And now it&#8217;s your turn. You&#8217;re going to wish you had left the country yesterday.�

Richard left the room for a moment, and came back with another chain. He took something black out of his pocket. Jenny couldn&#8217;t see straight from the slap, but then she saw it. A thick, black dog collar. The same one around Lori&#8217;s neck, Denise&#8217;s neck. 

�Think of it as your only real possession,� Richard said, lifting Jenny&#8217;s hair and placing the collar around her neck. Jenny heard the sound of the clasp and shut her eyes tight.

�You&#8217;re just a slave girl now,� Richard said. �You can forget your name.�

He attached the metal chain to her neck. It was heavy. It held her down. 
Richard untied her from the chair. Jenny took this as a sign that perhaps she could fight. She flung at Richard, tried to pull the chain away from him, tried to grab his balls and claw at his face. But her shots were weak, her offense easily defended. She was so confused and angry. Why was he so much stronger than me? She thought.

Richard tired of her resistance, and pulled the chain forward and down, causing Jenny to lose her footing and fall to the ground. Richard let loose with several kicks to Jenny&#8217;s midsection, ass, and head.

�Had enough?� Richard said. Jenny didn&#8217;t move. She just shivered and whimpered.

�Now,� Richard said. �Let&#8217;s begin.�
