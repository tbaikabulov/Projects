A Dilemma for Donna
By Petricia

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna nervously checked her makeup one last time. Tonight was to be the first social gathering among her peers since her divorce had become final six months ago. She had dated a few times since then, but nothing special. She been out a bit with friends, been to the gym regularly, but this was somewhat different and she wanted to look just so.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The invitation had itself taken her a bit by surprise. She really didn&#8217;t know Lauren that well. They had worked together at the university for nearly two years but had never become more than colleagues and acquaintances. Even from the outset Donna had been somewhat apprehensive about the tall brunette. She really couldn&#8217;t place it, perhaps something about her dark eyes, the way they seemed to look into her, almost predatory. While Lauren was always friendly, the warm smile seemed to belie something that lay beneath the surface.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever it had been Donna always felt a little uneasy around the woman. Of course it didn&#8217;t help that Donna was a bit jealous as well. Lauren seemed to have it all- beauty, poise, confidence. While most considered Donna attractive she certainly didn&#8217;t feel as though she could hold a candle to this woman. Perhaps it was that lack of self-confidence that had held Donna back in her career. Oh, she was well-liked, and secure in her position, but Lauren had, in just under her two years at the university, become head of her department. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was this very event that gave rise to the invitation. Lauren was giving a small cocktail party to celebrate her new position. Donna found it difficult to refuse as Lauren had been so adamant about her attendance. Apparently news of Donna&#8217;s divorce had spread as Lauren cited her need to get out and socialize in trying to coerce her into attending. She also pointed out that several of the more influential faculty members would attend, including the Dean.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna had finally relented and accepted the invitation. She stood now, touching up her lipstick and appraising her reflection in the mirror. She had chosen a simple black cocktail dress, a small strand of pearls and some low black heels. Her shoulder length blonde hair was pinned neatly at the back of her head. While she was actually quite attractive, with tiny waist, small firm breasts and long, toned legs, she couldn&#8217;t help but criticize every aspect of her appearance. Such was her self esteem, her ex-husband had seen to that. Even with her religious work ethic at the gym he had never been satisfied with her looks. Her b-cup breasts had been too small. Her behind, which he had initially complained about being too big, was now taut and shapely. Although now she had a fabulously lithe body she still couldn&#8217;t get past the emotional scars he had inflicted. Even as she had molded her body into the athletic figure she now displayed he had been sleeping with some bimbo he had found in a bar.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna wiped the memory of it all from her mind and tried to concentrate on just enjoying the evening. Taking her wrap from the coat rack she opened the door, feeling the warm summer evening breeze greet her. For the first time in a long time she felt good.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She arrived at the address on the invitation about fifteen minutes early.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Wow,� she though �Lauren really knows how to live.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The building was lovely, very upscale and near to the marina. Although she had never been here before she was certain Lauren must have an ocean view.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parking her car she debated as to whether she should go up now and be early, or wait here for a bit. She wasn&#8217;t certain she wanted to be alone with Lauren.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �You&#8217;re just being silly!� she told herself as she grabbed her purse and climbed out of the car.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The foyer was just as lovely as the rest of the building, she noted as she buzzed Lauren&#8217;s suite.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Hello Donna, you look just lovely!� the intercome proclaimed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Th..Thankyou.� she replied, noticing the camera now.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �You&#8217;re a bit early, but please come on up!� came the cheerful reply.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Riding up in the elevator Donna felt a bit odd though she couldn&#8217;t place it. She assumed it was just nerves. She had not been in many social situations in quite a while. That, coupled with the uneasy feeling that seemed to accompany Lauren&#8217;s presence just made her feel that way, she assumed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the elevator doors opened, it was easy enough to find Lauren&#8217;s townhome. There were only two per floor it seemed. Ringing the bell she felt a shiver run through her. She couldn&#8217;t fathom why that would happen.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauren answered the door wearing a royal blue silk robe which did little to hide her assets, her breasts threatening to burst from the deep vee neckline. Donna was momentarily taken aback, not only by Lauren&#8217;s present state of undress, but by her endowment, which she obviously kept well disguised in a working environment.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing Donna&#8217;s surprised look she offered an explanation,�Sorry, I&#8217;m running a bit late and you were just a tad early.� Then with a wide eyed look, �I hope you don&#8217;t mind!�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly feeling guilty although not quite sure why,�No no�it&#8217;s alr�I mean, I was early, s..sorry.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Well, that was articulate! Get a hold of yourself Donna.� cursing herself silently.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauren graciously ushered Donna to the living room, an impeccably decorated expanse of texture and color. Donna wondered how the woman could afford all this, certainly not on the salary she received from the university. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gliding to the wet bar on impossibly high heels, Lauren offered Donna a drink.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Try my cosmo, it&#8217;s to die!� handing Donna a delicate martini glass filled with the delicious looking liquid.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Come on, we can chat while I finish getting ready.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna followed meekly behind, noticing the pronounced sway created by the high stilettos and wondering how anyone could walk in those things much let alone move so gracefully.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Entering the bedroom Donna noticed that the French doors to the balcony were open wide, a gentle sea breeze causing the sheer drapes to sway lazily to and fro. Donna moved to the balcony to admire the view. Just as she had suspected the view was incredible. As Donna made her way back to sit on the bed Lauren sat at the vanity and began to brush her chin length bob of dark brown locks into an intentionally disheveled, yet sophisticated style which framed her high cheekbones, dark eyes, and full lips perfectly. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They made small talk, Lauren occasionally capturing Donna&#8217;s gaze in the mirror. Each time this happened Donna would quickly lower her eyes, eliciting a wry grin from Lauren.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Perfect.� Lauren thought knowingly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna gulped her drink hoping to ease her tension. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Feel free to help yourself Donna.� Lauren offered.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Thankyou. I will.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having refilled her liquid courage Donna returned to the bedroom to find Lauren standing near her closet. As she turned she slipped the robe from her shoulders, the soft fabric gliding effortlessly to the floor to reveal a body that Donna was certain could only belong to a centerfold or a pornstar.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearing Donna&#8217;s gasp Lauren made a show of being coy, crossing her hands across her perfect breasts. While she was completely nude from the waist up, she wore sheer white panties which left absolutely nothing to the imagination including the fact that she was completely shaved. As if to frame the panties she also wore sheer white stay-up stockings that glistened in the afternoon light.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Oh, I&#8217;m sorry, does it bother you?� she asked the shocked blond in mock innocence.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trying her best to regain her composure Donna blurted out �No no, it&#8217;s ok! I�.don&#8217;t mind.� Sitting on the bed, �Really, it&#8217;s fine.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauren slipped into her attire for the evening, a shining silver sheath slit up one leg to her hip, with a neckline guaranteed to hold everyone&#8217;s attention. The silver open toes with what looked to Donna to be at least 5 inches tall completed the look. Lauren could have stepped straight from the cover of a magazine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doing her best runway spin, Lauren inquired �So, what do you think?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna was thankful she had not been chewing gum, for she would have swallowed it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �You�.look amazing!� came the hesitant reply.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna quickly took another gulp of her drink as the chime of the downstairs door beckoned the two women back to the living room. Lauren rang in the first of the guests. The next hour was filled with greetings, pleasantries and happy chatting. All the while Donna couldn&#8217;t take her eyes off of Lauren, which she found bewildering. She had never had any homosexual tendencies, never found another woman particularly attractive. Oh, there had been the random curiosity once or twice, perhaps even a fantasy of two, but that was it. Why, she wondered, was she behaving this way?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauren was the hit of the party. Of course it was her party so naturally she received and gave a lot of attention to her guests. But Donna found herself wanting Lauren&#8217;s attention, almost jealous of anyone who spent too much time with her.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was as she contemplated this that the alcohol seemed to find its way to her head. She finally began to relax, inhibitions floating into the haze of her subconscious. She found herself attempting to catch the luminescent brunette&#8217;s eye, even trying to flirt with her.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifteen minutes and yet another drink later Donna found it getting a bit stuffy in the room. Seeking fresh air she made her to the balcony only to find it occupied by one of the other faculty members and his wife, who evidently did not appreciate the amount of attention he was paying to their hostess. Uncomfortable with being witness to their squabble, she discretely slipped back into the room. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Maybe I should just leave� she was thinking to herself as she felt a gentle hand take hers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauren had noticed her predicament. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Come on, let&#8217;s try the other balcony. Don&#8217;t worry, it is completely private.� Lauren gently led Donna through the bedroom and out onto the balcony. Lauren was right. The balcony faced west and she could neither see nor hear the bickering couple on the main balcony.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Thankyou so much Lauren� grateful not only for her understanding and kindness, but also for her attention. Feeling better in the fresh air, Donna stood gazing at the moonlit ocean. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Quite something, isn&#8217;t it?� Lauren said in a hushed tone from just behind her,�Feeling any better?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �A little, thankyou.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna felt soft hands begin a gentle massaging of her shoulders.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �The sea breeze has remarkable recuperative powers, don&#8217;t you think?� Lauren breathed into her ear. Donna closed her eyes, feeling the closeness of this remarkable woman.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rewarded with a slight shiver Lauren leaned in closer, hands moving down the blonde&#8217;s arms, breasts pressing into her back. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna felt her heart race, her breathing quicken. She squeezed the railing, knuckles turning white. She felt the warm breath on her neck, the gentle hands so soothing, yet insistent.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �You enjoy this Donna, don&#8217;t you?� her hands now on the blonde&#8217;s hips, gently caressing her waist.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna remained in a daze, partly from the alcohol, partly from the ministrations of this beautiful woman. She couldn&#8217;t believe this was happening.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �I asked you a question Donna. You don&#8217;t want to answer?� she whispered, pouting in a hurt tone.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna still barely heard, so lost was she in her internal struggle between loving this feeling and the knowledge that this was wrong.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �N�no, I mean yes Lauren.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Yes what Donna? Yes you like it or yes you don&#8217;t want to answer?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna&#8217;s mind was being bombarded. She couldn&#8217;t form a coherent answer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Yes I want to answer and��.y..yes I like it. Unghhhh�� Lauren&#8217;s roving hands had found their way up her waist to her breasts which, much to her dismay, had become incredibly sensitive, her nipples threatening to poke holes right through her bra.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauren continued her assault on Donna&#8217;s senses, one hand leaving a breast to slither down her front.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna felt the hem of her skirt lifted slowly and awaited the touch which she knew was inevitable now. The moments seemed an eternity when she was finally rewarded with a gentle touch on the front of her panties, the palm of Lauren&#8217;s hand settling over her mound.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly it was as if Donna&#8217;s world was centered in her womb. She knew nothing but the intense desire that radiated from her loins.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �My my Donna, we are excited, aren&#8217;t we?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna blushed furiously at the realization that her arousal was causing her to wet her panties. This had hardly ever happened before, almost never in fact. The fact that a woman brought about this reaction was equally hard to bear.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna opened her mouth to say she should be going now, but all that came out was �Ohmigod� in a hoarse whisper.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �You have no idea Donna, no idea.� Lauren cooed. She had this woman where she wanted her and decided now was the time.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Touch me Donna.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna held tight to the handrail, finding security in it. While she was in ecstasy, loving the feelings washing over her, she was also conflicted. Her upbringing told her this was wrong, a sin, unnatural. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing Donna&#8217;s hesitation Lauren calmingly whispered �It&#8217;s ok Donna. I won&#8217;t bite. Just enjoy what you are feeling. Here, give me your hand.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna&#8217;s mind fought to regain control from her body, but the gentle voice, the soft touch, the smell of her perfume were overpowering. Donna released her death grip on the handrail and felt Lauren gently take her wrist, guiding it behind her to the front of the silver gown.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Touch me Donna. That&#8217;s good, touch me� she whispered, barely audible. She guided Donna&#8217;s hand up and down slowly, breathing into her ear �Mmmmmmm, Donna, so goooood. Do you like it? Hmmmmmm?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Oh�god�..yes� the breathless response.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Under my dress now Donna, please, touch me under my dress.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna released the railing with her other hand and began to turn, but being pressed against the railing she couldn&#8217;t.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Just reach back and lift it Donna, touch me, tooouch meee.� Lauren encouraged her.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna reached back with her other hand to find the slit in the gown and began with both hands now to work the hem up Lauren&#8217;s silky legs. As the panties beneath finally came within reach Donna felt something cool encircle her wrists, accompanied by two ratcheting sounds.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna&#8217;s eyes flew open and she spun around only to find that she could not bring her hands back in front of her.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �What are you doing?� asked Donna, eyes wide as saucers. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauren, whose demeanor did not change, answered calmly �Simply put Donna. I intend to have you tonight. You will receive pleasure like you have never known. You, in turn, are going to give me pleasure. But I intend to be in control, and I am quite certain control is what you need.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �You can&#8217;t do this! Let me go!� Donna retorted. �I don&#8217;t want this. I want to go home.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �You need this Donna, even if you are not aware of it.� Moving in until they were eye to eye. �And I don&#8217;t believe you really want to go home,� whispering in her ear �do you?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Y..yes, yes! Please take these off of me.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �You may remove them yourself Donna. The keys are in your purse on the small table next to the front door. Simply go and get them.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �I�.can&#8217;t go out there like this!�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Of course you can Donna, if you really wish to leave.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Walking back to the door, her behind still swaying seductively �Well, I must attend to my guests. If you wish to leave go right ahead. I&#8217;ll be back to check on you in a bit. If you decide to stay�� her hungry smile completing her sentence. Lauren turned and was gone, leaving Donna alone on the balcony, her mind racing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She fought against panic, she fought against the handcuffs, she fought the urge to scream, knowing if she did everyone would come running. She would be deeply humiliated, but free-maybe. Lauren surely would considered that possibility and would no doubt have a plausible explanation. In fact she could simply deny knowing anything about it. After all the keys to the handcuffs were in her purse, not Lauren&#8217;s.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another course of action would be to try and retrieve the keys without attracting attention to her bound wrists. It would be difficult, but just maybe.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A third choice, and the one she decided on, was to remain here and talk Lauren into releasing her. Surely she would listen to reason. Yes, this was the best thing to do. She decided to go inside and sit down. Listening to the music and muffled voices from the other side of the door, she couldn&#8217;t help but wonder how she had gotten herself into such a mess. She wasn&#8217;t gay and she wasn&#8217;t interested in being tied up and the like, yet she had most definitely responded to Lauren&#8217;s attentions. Perhaps, she mused, some part of her wanted this. So she sat, waiting for Lauren&#8217;s return and an opportunity to get herself out of this situation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In time Lauren did return to check on her, as promised. Donna begged, pleaded, threatened, appealed to reason. Lauren simply took the bound woman in her arms, holding her close, breasts pressing into one another, hips grinding, one hand freely exploring Donna&#8217;s toned behind.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowing what was coming Donna declared �I&#8217;m not gay.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauren persisted, �Silly, you don&#8217;t know what you are.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slipping her hand under Donna&#8217;s dress and drawing out decidedly wet fingers, she held them up for the captive girl to see, �Well we definitely know you are wet!�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna blushed madly. Lauren lifted her chin and smothered the blonde&#8217;s lips with her own. Donna struggled feverishly at first, then more feebly, eventually succumbing to the soft lips, gentle hands, and her own hormones. Slowly her lips parted and then softened to accept and, to her surprise, return the kiss. She allowed Lauren to explore her warm mouth with her long and very talented tongue.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauren finally broke the kiss, leaving an overheated Donna panting heavily. Wiping a bit of saliva from Donna&#8217;s lower lip, she asked �Still want to go home?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try as she might Donna could not manage an answer. She worked her mouth as if to form words, but no sound escaped her lips.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauren was delighted with the reaction she had elicited from the blonde. Playfully she stood back and examined Donna, mimicking an artist scrutinizing his work.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Hmmmmm. I guess you haven&#8217;t decided yet. Here, let me give you something to help you think.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauren withdrew something from her vanity. Spinning Donna around she pulled the zipper of her black dress down to her waist. Reaching in she unhooked the black bra. Donna felt something cool at her shoulder, accompanied by a quick &#8216;snick&#8217;. Jusy as the realization that her bra strap had been cut, the process was repeated on the other side. Lauren quickly snatched the ruined garment from her and zipped the dress up.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna didn&#8217;t have to look down to know that her nipples were straining against the fabric of her dress. There was no mistaking the fact that she was topless, especially with her hands held behind her back, forcing her breasts forward.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As she watched Lauren&#8217;s retreating back her heart sank. Her hopes of escaping this situation were fading quickly. She couldn&#8217;t help but wonder what the other guests thought of her disappearance or what Lauren had told them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After another 20 minutes Lauren appeared once again. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �The party is winding down Donna. I couldn&#8217;t help but notice you haven&#8217;t left the bedroom. I guess you really don&#8217;t want to leave after all.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Please Lauren, I don&#8217;t want to do this. Please let me go. You know I can&#8217;t walk out there like this.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pressing a finger to Donna&#8217;s protesting lips, Lauren said gently �You know Donna, I didn&#8217;t really plan on needing to do this but you really aren&#8217;t giving me much choice.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauren pulled something from the dresser which appeared to Donna to be some thin belts. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Donna, I want you to open your mouth wide now.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Wha�..� Donna didn&#8217;t finish her question as a thick rubber penis forced it&#8217;s way past her lips. She tried to resist but it was too late. Holding her head with one hand, Lauren pushed the thick penis gag until it seated itself against Donna&#8217;s lips. Nearly gagging, Donna fought against the intrusion, but Lauren persisted, buckling the straps tightly behind her head.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna&#8217;s mewing from behind the gag was music to her ears. She truly hadn&#8217;t planned on gagging Donna at this point but simply couldn&#8217;t resist. After all, the blonde looked just delicious with her lips wrapped around the thick penis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t help but playfully tease the bound woman a bit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �If you really want to leave Donna, just say the word��go ahead, just tell me and off you go�.any time now Donna. No? I knew you really wanted to stay.� Kissing her on her gag. �Well, I need to see some of the guests out. Let&#8217;s make the wait more fun for you.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Returning to the dresser she pulled some items out which Donna could not see. When Lauren turned back to face her, her eyes widened. She could clearly see another pair of chrome cuffs in one hand, but it was what was in the other hand that bothered her most and caused her to shake her and mewl her protest through the gag.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauren tossed the cuffs on the bed, then knelt in front of the wide eyed blonde. Lifting Donna&#8217;s dress she pulled the lacy black panties down her thighs and let them slither the rest if the way to gather at her feet. Placing the black head of the dildo at the entrance to Donna&#8217;s womanhood, Lauren teased the labia, occasionally letting it press on the now sensitive clit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Spread your legs Donna.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blonde refused. Lauren grasped the engorged clit and squeezed, increasing the pressure and repeating the command,�Spread your legs Donna! It is going to happen one way or another, so let&#8217;s do it the easy way, shall we?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pain pressed Donna into compliance, spreading her legs wide. The dildo slipped in immediately, finding little resistance. Lauren pressed until the wide base seated itself. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna was no stranger to dildos and had a number of them at home. What else could she do? Her husband had long ago given up on sex with her, even before their separation. So she was somewhat surprised to find this dildo didn&#8217;t fill her terribly full.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as this thought occurred to her Lauren reached between her outstretched legs and began pumping the bulb attached to the base of the intruder. Donna at first enjoyed the sensation of the dildo growing inside her, filling her satisfyingly. But her eyes flew open wide as it continued to grow in her, stretching her fully.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was only when Donna began a labored grunt with each pump that Lauren finally stopped. She released the hem of the dress, stood, and grabbed the other cuffs. These were slightly larger and went on Donna&#8217;s slender ankles, with a short chain between them. Donna was going to be taking very short steps while wearing these.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Satisfied for the moment, Lauren headed for the door. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �I must see to my guests Donna. Enjoy!�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blowing Donna a kiss, she opened the door to return to the living room. But this time she left it open.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauren peeked her head back in �Remember, you can leave any time. Just come out and get the keys.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna was left alone once again. Well, somewhat alone. With the door wide open she could clearly hear most of what was happening in the other rooms. She wanted desperately to close the door. If anyone saw her in this state she would just die! With mincing steps she started toward the door to close it. As she rounded the huge bed and was nearing the door she was suddenly bathed in light. Someone had turned on a light in the short hallway leading to the bedroom. She could see the dean and his wife at the end of the hallway, apparently saying their goodnights. Fortunately their backs were to her. Quickly she hopped back to the dark side of the room. There was no way for her to reach the door now without taking a huge risk of being seen. Crouching in a corner she prayed no one would have a reason to come in here.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As she hid in her very flimsy sanctuary she listened to the sounds of chatting, joking and laughter, wondering if all that joviality was directed at her. Perhaps they all knew precisely where she was, what state she was in. She would never be able to return to work, to face any of them again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As tears rolled down her burning cheeks her mind was waging a battle with itself-reason versus imagination and shame. There was also the problem of Lauren to deal with. Even though guests were beginning to leave Lauren wasn&#8217;t going anywhere. She had already done unbelievable things to her and no doubt had more planned. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Maybe she will let me go when everyone leaves� she rationalized though she knew it was not to be.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She guessed the party was nearly over. She could hear only one conversation and it sounded as if they were saying goodnight. �Once the last person has gone I will simply go and get the keys. She said I could.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just then Lauren appeared in the doorway. Moving quickly she removed some new items from the dresser. Pulling Donna upright she first removed the pearl strand Donna had chosen for the evening and quickly wrapped a thick collar around the slender neck and attached a chain leash to it. The click of a lock told her it was not coming off without the key. With a pull of the leash she led the struggling blonde to the closet. The end of the leash was passed over the clothes bar and tied. Retrieving the keys on her own was no longer an option.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t go away Donna.� Lauren turned to go then, looking over her shoulder �By the way the dean and his wife hope you feel better. Perhaps I should send them in to say goodnight?� she teased.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For her part Donna simply stared on wide eyed, grunting and mewing her protest into the thick phallus wedged in between her teeth.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a mixture of both dread and relief Donna heard Lauren bid goodnight to the last guests. The only sounds she heard now were the click clack of heels as they moved around the vast expanse of the home. Soon the sound grew louder announcing Lauren&#8217;s approach. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She appeared in the doorway, a lioness stalking her prey. The only problem was that the prey was tethered in the den. The chase was over before it had begun.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauren sauntered over, carrying in her arms a bundle of something Donna couldn&#8217;t make out. Setting her bundle on the bed she spun Donna around to face away from her. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Let&#8217;s get you more comfy.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna felt the zipper of her dress run down to her behind. The dress was pulled down as far as the bound arms would allow. Lauren couldn&#8217;t resist a brief fondle of the blonde girl&#8217;s pert breasts.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Now Donna, I am going to release your hands for a moment. You will feel the urge to struggle, but I must tell you that you are in no position to do so. And although I have been very gentle with you, I can also be very cruel. Please don&#8217;t make me do that Donna.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna felt her hands freed for the first time in hours. Her black cocktail dress fell away. For a moment she considered attempting to release herself, but given her situation it would be hopeless.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Place your hands behind your back Donna, palms touching.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something cool and soft was being worked up her arms. A puzzled Donna looked down to see a strap go over her shoulder to cross her chest and down under the other arm. As the process was repeated in reverse she realized with despair that this was some sort of garment designed to hold her much or securely. Donna now felt first her wrists pulled together tightly, then her forearms, followed by her elbows. Lauren made a few adjustments to the laces here and there, then began tightening once more. When she was finished Donna felt as if her arms were welded together as one behind her. As if that wasn&#8217;t enough she felt straps tighten around wrist, forearm and elbow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �This is more comfy?� Donna wondered to herself.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tug on the leash told Donna they were going somewhere. She was led from the bedroom trying to keep up with her limited steps. Across the living room they trekked, a naked bound blonde led by a fully clothed beautiful brunette.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arriving at the other bedroom suite, Lauren turned to Donna.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �This room is reserved for special occasions Donna. Tonight you are the special occasion.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauren opened the door and drew Donna to the threshold, reaching over to switch on the lights. Donna froze in the doorway, looking about with astonished wide blue eyes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the tug on the leash returned, Donna wailed into her gag �
Nooooooooo��..�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

A Dilemma for Donna
By Petricia
Part 2


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna tried her best to fight the pull on her leash as she was drawn into the room. Unfortunately her bondage allowed her no leverage and the battle was already lost. Though she tried desperately to voice her distress, the gag allowed only feeble mewing and grunting. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sight that awaited her inside was the source of her concern. There were various pieces of apparatus, most of which she did recognize. She did, however, recognize the gynecological chair to one side. She also recognized what appeared to be medieval stocks, although they appeared to be of modern design. The walls were covered with various implements of bondage, not to mention whips, paddles and many items clearly designed to inflict pain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it was the item in the center of the room, beneath a single spotlight that truly frightened her. Bathed in the glow of the light&nbsp; was a steel cage, obviously quite strong, with thick silver bars and a heavy padlock. Inside the cage-----was a man! Though she could not see his face for the tight leather helmet locked onto his head, it was quite definitely a man. His hands were cuffed to opposite bars as were his feet, keeping him in a spread-eagle stance. Looking a little closer Donna noticed the chastity device locked on his manhood and keeping him in constant agony as his erection fought against the curve of the acrylic tube surrounding it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man&#8217;s groaning accompanied by the pathetic mewing of the struggling blonde played a symphony to Lauren&#8217;s ears. Donna was acutely aware of the blue eyes watching her bound form from under the mask. She wanted more than anything to hide, her exposed womanhood clearly on display and her breasts thrust forward by her bondage. Her cheeks flushed with shame at being exposed in this way, she dug in her heels once again only to be drawn forward by the incessant pull on the leash.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Well Donna, I think we need to keep you occupied while I deal with Mr�.well let&#8217;s just call him Mr. Smith.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sensing Donna&#8217;s puzzlement, Lauren continued �You see Donna aside from my position at the university I am also a professional Dominatrix. This gentleman is one of many ardent admirers who gladly pay for my services. Or did you think one could afford a home like this on the salary paid by the university?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She whispered so that only Donna could hear �You, of course, are strictly for pleasure.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As she spoke Lauren guided Donna to the back of the room, out of sight of the bound form in the cage. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Mr. Smith here is an out of town client and was just so desperate to please me he didn&#8217;t mind being a guest here while we had our little party this evening. Isn&#8217;t that right, Mr. Smith?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pained groan eminated from under the hood in response. Donna was amazed at the woman&#8217;s conversational tone in such an extraordinary circumstance.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Isn&#8217;t life funny Donna? I had fully planned on paying several visits to my guest here. Instead there you were, just begging to be with me.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna attempted to protest but again was thwarted by the evil gag. Lauren was squatting in front of her and releasing the air from the blow up dildo stuffing her so full.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the plug slid free Lauren stood, holding the dripping phallus before her wide blue eyes �Don&#8217;t try to deny it Donna, you wanted me, you still do. Just look! You are positively gushing.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna grunted through her nose, shaking her head from side to side. The smokey eyes held hers, transfixed by their power. As a drop of moisture traveled slowly down her inner thigh she hung her head in defeat and humiliation. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How had she come to this? She was completely under the power of another woman, one who clearly planned to use her in immeasurably wicked ways. Yet through her fear and humiliation she was also tremendously excited- as much as she had ever been.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauren was not busy with something behind her though dared not look. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Releasing the ankle cuffs she pressed outwardly on Donna&#8217;s thighs, encouraging her to spread her legs, stopping only when they about three feet apart.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Ok Donna, I want you to bend over as far as you can now.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna began to bend at the waist and was not allowed to stop until her upper body was horizontal. As a hand steadied her she felt something cool at her overexcited sex. Just as she was thinking she might like this she felt the pressure at her rear passage as well.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Nnnnnnnnnn!� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eyes flying wide open, she tried instinctively to straighten up. A hand at the nape of her neck kept her in her vulnerable position.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �I am guessing you haven&#8217;t had anything up there before. Just calm down, relax your sphincter muscle. It will slip right in. Don&#8217;t worry, this is a very small plug.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This did little to reassure the impaled blonde as the pressure increased and she felt as though she were being skewered by a telephone pole.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Shhhh, shhhh, nice and easy Donna, here we go, good girl� lauren cooed in her ear.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The soothing tone of her voice calmed her down a bit, though the pain was increasing. She was now grunting desperately through her nose and a light sheen of perspiration had covered her. Just as the pain became too much the plug slipped in past the widest part and seated itself inside her behind and the accompanying dildo slid deep within her womb. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �There we go Donna. That wasn&#8217;t so bad, was it?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �She&#8217;s kidding, right?� Donna couldn&#8217;t help thinking.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helping the now double penetrated blonde to stand, Lauren guided her backwards slowly until she was standing over a short gleaming pole jutting from the floor below. She knelt down and turned a small knob on the pole and raised the end until it mated with a hole in the fixture now protruding from Donna&#8217;s lower orifices. There was a soft click signifying that Donna was now mated with the pole. Lauren continued upward pressure until Donna was forced onto her toes, then locked off the pole.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna tried experimentally to stand flatfooted, finding the objects inside of her pushed more deeply into her. While the pain this caused was not bad, it was certainly uncomfortable and she suspected would become more so after time. She raised onto her toes again only to feel the increased strain in her calves. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Donna contemplated the fix she was in, Lauren had been busy. She plugged two wires into recepticles near the base of the dildos and was now approaching with some other items in her hands. The first was a thick blindfold and just as she was buckling it on the first vibrations eminated from the dildos buried deep inside Donna. In the relative quiet of the room the buzzing seemed as loud as an airplane flying through, especially to Donna, who moaned in despair. The humiliation of the situation was overwhelming her senses, yet the excitement was undeniable. Lauren had proven that.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauren placed tiny earbuds into her ears, and just before turning on the MP3 player, she whispered to the struggling blonde �Sorry dear, but our guest should have some privacy for the rest of his stay. You make a lovely picture!�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shiver that ran through the bound body did not go unnoticed by Lauren. She smiled sweetly, kissed Donna gently on her cheek and turned on the music player. White noise flooded Donna&#8217;s ears and she was plunged into a world of her own, centered around the searing heat of her sex.
