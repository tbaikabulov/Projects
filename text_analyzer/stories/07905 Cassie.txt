Synopsis:  Cassie got into serious debt. the solution became the biggest problem






Cassie was a looker. And she knew it. She had that kind of look that turned men&#8217;s heads when she walked down the street, and she always dressed to get attention.

Her usual style of dress was either skin tight trousers, high heels that made her long legs look even longer and slimmer, and tops that did little to hide the swell of her breasts.

If it wasn&#8217;t the trousers, it was mini skirts. They didn&#8217;t actually display the pleasures hidden beneath, but every man I know would have done anything to discover them for himself. Including myself.

I knew I wanted her, and I new that if I didn&#8217;t get her one day, it would drive me crazy. I didn&#8217;t care that she was not interested. I didn&#8217;t care if she liked it or not, I just knew I had to get her somehow.

The opportunity came when mail intended for her ended up on my door mat. The postman had mixed one of her letters up with one of mine. The street name was similar.. I was tempted to take it round to her, as I knew she would smile, and I would get to see that magnificent cleavage close up. But I was in a hurry to get to work, and slipped her letter, with my own, into my briefcase.

I would deliver it later. After work.

I had a busy day, and didn&#8217;t really stop until lunch time. Until then, my mail had remained in the case, unread. As I relaxed with a coffee, I pulled the mail out and began opening it. Without thinking, I opened hers by mistake, and it was only as I started to read it, that I realised it wasn&#8217;t for me. But, I also knew, it would give me an in to her.

The letter was from the bank. She was overdrawn, and the bank were threatening to foreclose on her home. 

She had always given the impression that she was loaded, and this was a bombshell. I actually worked for the same bank. And, oddly enough, I was in a position where I could stop the foreclosure. I am not prepared to tell you what my position with the bank is, but suffice it to say few can over rule my decisions.

I knew I had her. She would have a choice. Her home, or my bed. It was going to be that simple. 

I placed the letter back in another envelope, with a note from myself suggesting she talk to me if she wanted a way out of the mess. I didn&#8217;t tell her I was her neighbour, simply told her to ring me at my office, and I would arrange a meeting.

The meeting would not be at the bank. That much was certain. And if all went well. Well, who knows.

I knew the letter would get to her on the Monday morning, unless, of course, the post man delivered it to the wrong address again. I would give her a week, and then send a more severe notice out to her. At the same time, I put a stop on the foreclosure. But she would not know this.


It was the following Thursday when the call came through. She had got the letter on Monday, as planned, and spent three days worrying about the contents. She couldn&#8217;t afford to lose her home, nor could she afford people in the area to know she hadn&#8217;t paid her mortgage for a long time. 

She had always given the impression that money was no object. Expensive clothes, impressive car. 

I did a check on her finances, contacting a few friends who could give me the information I was after.

She was deep in debt. Maybe not the national debt, but far more than she could ever get herself out of. Her credit cards were topped out, her bank account was so far in the red I couldn&#8217;t believe the manager hadn&#8217;t called her in about it. She owed money all over town. And, she was also out of work.

Without help, there was no way she could solve her debt problems.

Myself, on the other hand. I could solve them with the flick of a pen. Actually, the click of a computer mouse. But for me to do that, it would cost her dearly. It would be her choice, at the end of the day. But armed with the knowledge I had, I couldn&#8217;t see what other choice she could make.

I met her at a coffee bar away from prying eyes, and out of earshot. I didn&#8217;t want anyone hearing what I was saying. Some people would call it blackmail, and perhaps they would be right. Personally, I thought of it as self help. I would help her, and help myself at the same time.

She arrived dead on time, and wearing one of her normal outfits. If the trousers were any tighter, they would have been painted on her. And the top showed enough to interest, and to tantalise. Maybe she thought this would help her win me over. All it did was make me want her more. And I knew that sooner or later, I would have my hands on those tits.

�Mrs Walker� I said, as she sat down. �As you know, the bank holds the mortgage on your house. Right at this moment in time, there have been no repayments made for some eight months. We checked up on a few other things, and we have discovered that, other than what you owe the bank, you are financially in a state of meltdown. Does this agree with your own opinion?�.

She looked over at me, her hands toying with the cup in front of her. Her voice was low, and soft, and, if I say so myself, sexy as well.

�I do seem to be having a bit of a problem� she admitted.

�A bit of a problem?� I asked. �You owe the credit card company seven thousand pounds. Your car is about to be repossessed, the bank is about to take away your home. You have no employment. I think this is more than just a slight problem, Mrs Walker�

My voice was not meant to put her at ease. I wanted her to know how serious her situation was, and to come to terms with the fact she was on the verge of losing everything she had.

�I am trying to sort it out. I have an interview for a job on Monday, and if I get it, I will be able to start repaying what I owe�.

She was looking down at the table in front of her, unable to look me in the eyes. I knew she was lying about the interview. When you have been around as long as I have, you can instinctively tell when someone is lying. But I ignored it for now.

�Mrs Walker. If you got a job today, and paid back every penny you earned for the next five years, I doubt you would be out of debt. The interest alone on your debts is mounting as we speak. And if the bank repossess your home? You have no collateral, Mrs Walker. Nothing substantial that you can offer us.�

�But please� she begged. �I just need more time. Surely the bank can see that�

I could see the tears welling up in her eyes. I got the feeling that until all her debts were laid out in front of her, she had no idea how bad the situation was. She simply spent money without thinking. A lot of people do. Its not a crime, but it is stupid.

�I don&#8217;t know what you expect the bank to do, Mrs Walker. This is not the first letter we have sent you. You have ignored the others, and I suspect you have only contacted us this time, because your home is in danger.�

�I don&#8217;t always read the mail� she admitted.

This was typical of people in debt. If they don&#8217;t read the mail, they can pretend things are okay. It&#8217;s the Ostrich syndrome. They bury their heads in the sand, and if they cant see the debt, the debt doesn&#8217;t exist. And all the time, things get worse, and the debt mountain grows.

�That, unfortunately, is not our problem. Imagine what would happen if no-one read their mail. Imagine what would happen if other people, like yourself, simply didn&#8217;t pay their debts, and then refused to admit to them. Even now you believe the next cloud will have the silver lining you are looking for, Mrs Walker. You have to waken up to the fact that you are in serious trouble�

The tears were now falling. It was easy for her to ignore everything before. But now, there was no way to ignore them. I had made sure of that. She now knew just how badly in debt she was, and I had left a lot out. None of the furniture in her house had yet been paid for, and the insurance money from her late husband, was already spent.

�I will give the matter some thought, Mrs Walker. I will let you know when I have made my decision. But, at this point, I really don&#8217;t know what I can do for you. I know you cannot afford to run anywhere, so, please, don&#8217;t try to hide from this any longer. Where ever you go, it will only follow you, with the added problem of the police. If you disappear, and take the car, or anything you have on credit, that will be theft. And believe me, the police will not be half as pleasant as I am being�

I stood up and walked away, leaving her with that thought. I didn&#8217;t even turn around to see if she was watching me. I didn&#8217;t care. I knew she was frightened. Part one was complete, and part two of my plan would take shape soon. 


I left her to stew for a month. I also froze all of her accounts, so if she tried to spend on her cards, they would be denied.

I sent her fifty quid a week in a plain envelope, with a note saying �for food�. I didn&#8217;t sign it, but she had to have guessed I had sent it. I was, as far as she knew, the only person who knew the state of her finances, and the only person who would send her money.

�Mrs Walker� I was on the phone to her. �Meet me at the same coffee shop. I have a proposition for you�

She agreed to meet me, though I had refused to tell her what I had to offer on the phone. I wanted her in front of me when I gave her the bad news.

She arrived looking quite sullen. Her hair had lost its lustre, and she was not walking as confidently as she had in the past. The last month had taken it&#8217;s toll on her. Just as I had hoped it would. Other than the money I had sent her, she had been able to buy nothing. 

I was waiting for her when she arrived, and she sat down without a word.

�Mrs Walker, thank you for coming.� I extended a hand, and she shook it weakly.

�Thank you, for the money� she said. She didn&#8217;t ask if I had sent it, she knew. I said nothing about it, and went on to tell her what I had to say. This was not going to be easy, and could backfire in my face. But I was certain that it wouldn&#8217;t.

�I have spoken to the upper management at the bank about your situation. They are not prepared to change their position on this matter. Within six weeks, they intend to go to court to get a repossession order. And believe me, Mrs Walker. They will get it. In the recession there are many people who have lost their homes. Some, not as badly off as you. I tried everything I could to prevent it, but I am powerless to do so. As you know, they have already frozen any assets you had, which I remember are not too many. This does leave you in a precarious position, I am afraid.�

I could see the tears already. She wasn&#8217;t after sympathy this time, the tears were real. She knew, then, that everything she had was about to go up in flames.

�I said I have a proposition for you Mrs Walker, and I do. I will, however, make this offer only once. If you reject it, then I can be of no further help to you. Accept, and I will stop the credit card company from hammering on your door. I&nbsp; am prepared to settle your credit card debt for you, in person. I will also take your cards and cut them in half, in front of you. I will already have informed the company that you no longer wish to have credit with them, not that they would allow it again under any circumstances. All of this, I can do for you�

She looked at me quizzically.&nbsp; I could see in her eyes that she didn&#8217;t believe me.

�Accept my terms, and I will do it here and now. In front of you, so you can see I am not fooling around, Mrs Walker.�

�And your terms are what?� I could see she was already expecting something, but it wasn&#8217;t what I was about to ask for. No-one could have predicted this.

�I want you to move in with me, as my hose guest, house keeper. As long as you work well, I will make sure you want for nothing. However, if you refuse, there will be no second chance. As I said, accept, and your credit card debt will be solved in less than two minutes. I can do nothing about the house, but at least, by working for me, and living at my house, you will still have a roof over your head�

I knew this was going in at the deep end. But I had to shock her. And the look in here eyes told me I had done so. It certainly wasn&#8217;t what she expected.

She didn&#8217;t know what to say. And I knew that.

I placed a contract in front of her, which I knew she wouldn&#8217;t read.

�Sign this now, and move in as house keeper, and your problems are behind you. Refuse, and I will stand up, walk away, and leave you to your fate�

I was shaking inside, but I was able to hold my voice firm. I had to make her believe that she had no choice.

I placed a pen on top of the contract, and ordered another coffee each from a waitress.

I sat watching her. I don&#8217;t know what was going on in her head, but her fingers were already toying with the pen. She needed more encouragement.

�The car, Mrs Walker. I can settle that one as well for you, if you take this offer. Its up to you. You have until I drink this coffee to decide.�

I sat in silence, sipping the coffee and watching her eyes. She knew she was going to sign it, and so did I. I could feel the self satisfaction you get when a deal that should not have worked, went your way. Euphoric is the best way to describe it, but I had to hold that emotion inside. She had to believe that this was purely a business deal, until it was too late to do anything about it. And it would be, as soon as she signed the contract.

She had flipped the pages, but she hadn&#8217;t read a single word of it. What the contract said didn&#8217;t concern her. She only had to choose, and my coffee cup was almost empty.
Drinking my coffee I stood up and moved to reach for the papers on the table. Her hand pulled them away from me, as she gripped the pen. I could&nbsp; see her fingers turning white, such was the pressure.

Slowly, deliberately, she began to sign her name on the line, I told her to print her name and date the contract, before taking the pen from her, and adding my own signature.

Sitting back down I took out my phone and rang her credit card company, having taken her card from her. I gave them the account number, and then paid off her debt with a direct transfer from my own personal account. I saw here smile weakly. It was one problem removed, but in it&#8217;s place, she now had another one. Me.


I had things to do before I could go on with my next phase with Cassie. I relaxed the foreclosure notice on her house, and, as there was no sign of her around anywhere, it was sold in absentia.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know what she would have thought had she known I was the buyer. I buy my groceries at a small shop in the next town, and took Cassie there by car a few times, going past her house,. So she could see the FOR SALE sign in the garden. The first time we went past it I saw her turn her had and look back at what had once been her home. Now, she lived in an upper floor room at my house.

After the purchase had gone through, I drove past it again with her, so she could see it had been sold. That would be the last time she would see it. I rented it out to a family with three kids, and I never drove past with Cassie in the car again.

Her own car had been returned to the seller, with a letter from me, her banker, stating that she could no longer pay the instalments, as she had been declared bankrupt. She had. It was one more thing I managed to get arranged through a friend of mine.

The contract she had signed really was an employment contract, but hidden inside it, was power of attorney over her. Now she could own nothing, and had no rights to claim otherwise.

She herself had signed over power to me, and I had paid off certain debts, as I said I would. It would soon be time to put the next phase into operation.

But I was now in no rush. She worked well, and the house was always clean, and food was cooked well and served promptly. She didn&#8217;t even realise she s being trained for later.

My shirts were always laundered and pressed, as were my suits. Never did I leave the house in anything but perfect state.

She didn&#8217;t drink, and had stopped smoking. Part of this, I guess, was because I didn&#8217;t buy her anything to smoke. I smoked cigars, which she didn&#8217;t care for. I saw her struggle with the no smoking for a while, but she got used to it, and though she no longer smoked, my ashtray was always clear and clean whenever I got back from work.

She still wore the same sort of clothes around the house. Whether she knew I wanted what was inside them, I don&#8217;t know. But she continued to wear them anyway.

I had&nbsp; bought what I needed from the internet before she had signed the contract and moved in. they were hidden in the cellar. So far, she wasn&#8217;t even&nbsp; aware I had a cellar. The entrance was hidden behind a display cabinet in the kitchen, and there was no reason for her to know it was there. Not yet.

For over two months I allowed her to continue as my housekeeper, and to be honest, I could find no fault with her work. Even had my plans not been going further, I would have been happy with her.

But my plans did extend further. Much further. I still had not seen what lay under the clothes. I could have put cameras in the bathroom and her bedroom, but I chose not to do. I wanted to wait, and unwrap her at my leisure. 

I waited yet another month. She had no phone, and I could tell she had not used mine. Either my cell phone or the land line. The bills had come in, and only the calls I made personally had been shown. She was not contacting anyone. I suppose she didn&#8217;t want them knowing she was a lowly housekeeper. I didn&#8217;t blame her. It didn&#8217;t really sit well with the impression she had always given out.

I wondered what she would tell people if my plans worked as well as I wanted them to do.

At the end of the third month I had sent her shopping to the usual shop, and while she was out, I prepared the cellar. I had transformed it into a dungeon. There was a cage in one corner, and a frame to which she could be tied in another corner. I had built a toilet and bath along one wall, and installed cameras in various places. Each would send their pictures to monitors hidden at the back of my wardrobe. She must have been in that wardrobe a hundred times, and not spotted the false back.

I was ready. There would be no better time than the present, and, I now knew, she would not be missed. Next time I went to the grocers I would simply tell them she had left my employ. They would think nothing of it.

She returned around five thirty, and began cooking the evening meal. I wondered what she would do if she knew this would be the last cooking she would do for a while. I offered to make her a cup of coffee, which she smiled and thanked me for. I often made her coffee, as I knew that one day I would need to do, and I didn&#8217;t want it to be a surprise.

I put the drug in while she was doing something on the cooker, so she didn&#8217;t see it. I put it on the table, and walked through to the lounge to watch the local football results. She would call me when dinner was ready. The drug would not knock her out instantly. It would take a few hours, as it had to be digested. Time enough for her to eat dinner, wash up, and settle down for a while with the Saturday night film.

It didn&#8217;t matter what the film was, she always watched it in silence. In fact, she rarely ever spoke unless she had to. She was taking her job seriously. I think it was because she couldn&#8217;t afford to lose it.

It was half way through the film that I saw her eyes starting to close. I pretended I hadn&#8217;t noticed, and carried on watching the film. It was some weepy about a guy who finds a girl, falls in love, then they break up, but in the last reel, they find each other again, and all ends happily. There are hundreds of films like that, and I was sure we had seen this particular one before. Though it may have been one similar.

Cassie didn&#8217;t see how the film ended. The drug had taken full effect, and she was out cold. I left her in her chair as I watched it till the end. Having watched so much of it, it would have been a shame not to see just how they got back together.

Turning the television off I walked to the kitchen and moved the cabinet away from the cellar door, opening it ready. It took only a few minutes to return for Cassie and carry her down into her new home.

Laying her on the floor I quickly started to undress her. This was the first time I had seen the beauty underneath, and I was not disappointed. The clothes had not hidden anything, it was all as I had imagined it to be, though it came as a surprise to see she had a shaven pussy. An added bonus, as it saved me the job.

I fastened the leather collar around her neck, and the four leather cuffs around her wrists and ankles. Each was sealed by a strong but small padlock. None could be removed without the keys, and they were locked away safe and sound, and out of her reach.

The cellar had been soundproofed. That had been important, as I didn&#8217;t want to use a gag on her. I needed her to be able to speak when spoken to, though I did expect more than a little trouble getting her to obey me. One does not go into this sort of venture thinking life will be easy.

Satisfied, I lifted her up and placed her into the cage. It had a solid base, with a straw pillow for her head. Not other bedclothes. The cellar was warm enough, she would not need clothes. And besides, I wanted to look at her body as often as I was down there with her.

Leaving her alone, I returned to the kitchen, closed and locked the door, before returning the cabinet to it&#8217;s original position.

Whether Cassie agreed or not, now. It would make no difference. I had her exactly where I wanted her, and it had all been so easy.


I sat, sipping my brandy as she slowly came awake. She had no idea where she was, or how she got there. That much was clear. It took her several minutes to realise she was actually in a cage, and then she headed straight for the door, trying to force it open.. she had no chance. The door was controlled by an electronic lock. 

It was as she was struggling with the door that she saw the leather cuffs on her wrists. Her hand went straight to the padlock, trying in vain to pull it open.

It was amusing watching her try to figure out what had happened to her. I am sure she would remember watching the film, and then nothing. The drug had kept her unconscious for over twelve hours, and the cellar, would offer her no idea of time.

I had chosen lighting that, whilst not too bright, would show every corner of the dungeon clearly. No shadows for her to hide in.

Just how long it took to realise she was naked, I don&#8217;t know. She made cursory attempts to cover herself up, but her major attempts were to get the cuffs off, and the door to the cage open.

I could have turned the speaker on, but I could lip read enough to know what she was yelling about. I didn&#8217;t think she was capable of such words.

She could scream and shout as long as she wanted. No-one would hear her. The door to the cellar was thick oak, and with the cabinet behind it, little if any sound would get past. Unless I turned the speaker on, no-one could hear her at all.

I wasn&#8217;t ready for that, yet. I wanted her calmer before I listened to her. But she could listen to me.

Turning on the microphone I began to speak.

�Welcome to your new home Cassie. You can scream and shout all you ant, no-one can hear you. Not even me. The cage you are in now, is controlled by an electronic lock. The only way to open it, is with the device I currently have on the belt I am wearing. The cuffs on your wrists, ankles and the collar around your neck, can only be released if you have the key, which you don&#8217;t. nor do I actually. I threw them away, as they are to become a permanent fixture. I know you are expecting someone to come and rescue you, but believe me, that is not going to happen. No-one has seen you for over three months, and they didn&#8217;t come looking for you then, so don&#8217;t think they will now. As of the day you signed that contract, you owned nothing. You gave me power of attorney over you, and the bank reclaimed your house, which, as you have seen, has been sold. You have no money, no credit, no bank account, and, no clothes. I had a bonfire last night.�

I paused and watched her reaction to my words. As I expected, she made a renewed&nbsp; effort to get the cage open, but only succeeded in frustrating herself.

�By the way. You are probably the best fuck I ever had. �

I hadn&#8217;t done anything like that with her, but she wouldn&#8217;t know that. I saw her hand go between her legs, as if trying to find clues. 

�We will be doing that again soon enough, but for now, I just want you to get used to your new home. In a few minutes I am going to release you from the cage. There are bathing and toilet facilities for you, but no towels and no privacy. When I tell you to go back into the cage, do so. If not, you will get no food, and I will turn the heating up so you sweat like never before. I can control all of this from where I am sat. you will only see me when I want you to do, and when you are safely inside your cage.�

I clicked off the microphone and watched her. She was going at the cage door frantically, trying to force it open. I could only smile at her futile efforts. She would eventually get used to it, but it would take time, and effort, and patience. And I had all the time and patience a man could ask for.

I turned off the light in the dungeon, plunging her into total blackness. There were no windows, no faint lights filtering in. it was blackness like she had never known before. Unless you have stood on top of a mountain at midnight, well above the city lights, with no moon, then you have never experienced the blackness she now inhabited. She had no idea what, of anything else was in the dungeon with her. I turned on the infrared camera so I could see her, and started the tape I had made. Turning on the microphone I played the tape into the darkness. It was the sound of mice scurrying across concrete floors. 

I saw her pull sharply to one corner of the cage, frightened. She had to believe that there were mice in there with her. There could be no other explanation. She couldn&#8217;t see them, but she could hear them. 

It was pleasant to watch as she huddled into one corner of the cage in an effort to get away from the unseen guests.

Laughing to myself, I turned off the microphone. There is more than one way to skin a cat, and Cassie is going to do what I want, sooner than she wants.


I decided to leave her in the dark for the rest of the day. I would be returning to work the following morning, and she would be left alone to think about her future. It would do her good to starve, but at least I would let her out of the cage before I went to work. I assumed she had already pissed whilst in the cage, but that couldn&#8217;t be helped. If she wanted to do, she could clean it out herself while I was at work.

The cameras would record anything she did during the day. I made sure she knew I was going out for the day, but when I left, she was still sat in the cage, looking around, presumably for mice.

I had a busy day at work, lots of meetings with people who really didn&#8217;t know what they were on about. If only the companies I was dealing with had sent someone more savvy, then the day would have been worthwhile.

It was already starting to get darker as I arrived home. I sensed a thunderstorm coming. It wouldn&#8217;t matter, the garden could do with some water, and my guest wouldn&#8217;t know about it anyway.

I went to the monitors, one eye on them as I changed clothes. She was sat in one corner of the room, and I could see from the toilet roll she had at least used the toilet. I may or may not take a look later.

�Hello Cassie� I said as I turned the microphone on.

I saw her head whip around, trying to find me, as if I was in the room.

�This is where we see what you have learned. There is only a single chance of this, then you get to wait, and I will put you back in the dark, turn up the heat, and leave you alone with whatever else has found it&#8217;s way into your quarters. Now then Cassie, you have ten seconds to get back in your cage. If you do so, I will feed you. If you don&#8217;t, then you know the consequences. Your time starts now�

I watched smiling as she looked at the cage. She didn&#8217;t know whether I would keep her in it all night again, but she did know I intended to turn out the lights and increase the heat. A lot depended on whether she believed the mice were in the dungeon with her the night before.

I had turned on her speaker, so if she answered I would hear.

�If I do what you ask, will you still turn the lights out?�

�Cassie. When I make a deal then I stick to it. As I did with you and your financial affairs. I said I would sort them, and I did. Now, if you get into your cage, I will bring you some food down, and then let you back out of it. It&#8217;s that simple. If you say no, then the consequences are of your own making.�

She looked again at the cage. The ten seconds was up long ago, but I didn&#8217;t mind. This was the first test. Did she fear the dark more than she feared the cage.

Slowly, she edged towards the cage door. It was decision time for her, and she knew it.

�Five seconds left� I lied. �make your mind up Cassie�

She had. It wasn&#8217;t because she would obey me, she obviously feared the dark more, as she slid inside the cage. The door closed automatically when she was inside, and we could both hear the solid click as the lock engaged.

�Good girl Cassie� I told her. �I will be down with your food soon.�

I turned both the microphone and the speaker off, and smiled to myself. That time in the dark, playing with her mind, was the only reason she got back in the cage. Not for the food. But soon she would rethink things, and start to refuse to get ion when told. Especially when it wasn&#8217;t for food, but because I wanted her to get in.

I was not fooled by her complicity at this stage. 

I cooked the food and put hers on a plastic plate, and gave her plastic cutlery. I didn&#8217;t want her harming herself, or me.

Entering the dungeon I smiled over at her. The tirade I expected was quick to come, calling me all the names she could think of, and some I had never heard before. Threats of what she would do to me when she got free, were thick and fast. But she would never get free. She was the only one who, so far, was not aware of this. She obviously hung onto the hope that one day I would release her, or someone would come and find her.

I placed her food close to the cage, so she could reach it, ignoring her tirade of threats. She had tried to reach out to me, but I was just far enough away for it to be tempting, but not available. I think had she got hold of my leg when she tried, she would have done her best to cause me grievous harm.

I said nothing to her, as I walked out of the dungeon and back up stairs. What she had said and tried was only to be expected. I would not punish her for it this time.

I let her eat in peace, as I also ate my dinner. Unlike her, I had a glass of wine with mine, and settled down to watch the news and read the financial papers. There was no rush to recover her plate. It was just a shame I now had to wash the dinner things myself. She had been useful in that respect.


The refusal came on the third day. I had told her to get in the cage, and she had refused. I was pretty sure she had figured out that there were no mice there with her. In three days, she would have seen at least some droppings. 

She had also eaten for the past three days, and we both knew she was not about to starve to death. I wasn&#8217;t sure if she was just testing me to see what I would do. I did exactly what I said I would do, ad plunged the dungeon back into total darkness. At the same time, I turned the heating up to full. It would not take long for the dungeon to get unbearably hot, but it would take a lot of time to get back down to it&#8217;s normal level.

If Cassie wanted to play games, then I was more than happy for her to do so. I could stills see her through the infra red camera, so she was not exactly escaping my view either. Strangely enough, as soon as the lights went out, she headed for the cage. I guess she felt safe inside there. I didn&#8217;t close the door. Had I done so, she would know I could see her. I let her think she had won the battle. It wasn&#8217;t that she didn&#8217;t want to go in the cage, she didn&#8217;t want to go in because I had told her to do. That was the difference.

But, she would stay there for now. I would leave her in the dark until at least morning, maybe longer. There was water in the bath area if she needed a drink. It would, of course, mean leaving the cage and finding it, but I felt sure she knew where it was in relation to where she was currently. 

I watched her for a few more minutes, and then turned the heating back down.&nbsp; I knew she would already be suffering from the heat. It gets hot very quickly down there.

I wish I could say I felt sorry for her, but I didn&#8217;t. I had given her a choice, and she had made the one she wanted. I could only ever do what I said I would do if she chose to disobey me, and she had.

I set the timer to turn the heating on for fifteen minutes every ninety minutes. That would keep the cellar like a greenhouse, and she would have to suffer it. I was cool in my own room, and soon fell asleep.

I looked in on her in the morning. She was still in the cage, but her body seemed to glow. Maybe it was the infrared, but more likely it was the sweat she had been losing all night.

I turned the heating off again, and left her in the dark while I went to work. She would be fine, but I hoped more obedient when I returned later.

It was my late day, which meant I was in the office an extra two hours. I thought of her as I sat ruffling papers around on my desk. I knew the heat would not be as great for her now, but nor would it be cold down there. U had been tempted to leave the heater going on and off all day, but I didn&#8217;t think she could have handled that.

When I got home I made myself a drink, before going to check the monitors. As I turned them on, I could see her sitting on the toilet. I was tempted to turn the light on, but I refrained. It would have startled her, and I didn&#8217;t want to do that until she had finished.

When I saw her leave the toilet area, and start to crawl around the floor, looking for the cage I assumed, I turned the lights on.

Her hand immediately went to cover her eyes, the brightness after so long in the dark would hurt her eyes.

I turned the microphone on.

�Cassie. I hope you have had a pleasant day. It is so cool up here right now. I am going to say this just once, and then, if you don&#8217;t obey, you can go back into darkness and starve for another day. It really is your choice. I have made cottage pie for dinner, and far too much for myself. You can choose to eat, or go without. You have ten seconds to get into your cage, or its more of the same for you�

I watched her as she crawled towards the cage. I don&#8217;t think she wanted to get in, but the combination of the heat and lack of food, had made her mind up to obey me.

As she entered the cage I let it close. She didn&#8217;t even turn around as the electronic lock clicked into place. She had submitted this time, but I knew there would be other times when she would not.

I put her dinner on the plastic plate again, and put the plastic cutlery on one side. So far, when she ate, she had been good, and returned the cutlery with the empty plate. I guessed she had soon realised that it would not aid any escapes. When I was in the cellar, she was in the cage. And if she didn&#8217;t go in the cage, I didn&#8217;t go into the cellar. It was that simple, and would remain so for now.

She looked harshly at me as I passed her meal so that she could reach it. If looks could kill, I would have been dead. Of that I had no doubt.

�I really did enjoy your pussy the other night� I lied, seeing what reaction I could get from her. �Not too tight, but easily lubricated when I was inside you. It&#8217;s a shame you don&#8217;t remember it really.�

She still didn&#8217;t know if I was lying, or had fucked her before she had regained consciousness.&nbsp; I saw her glance between her legs, as if trying to find traces. But after this time, and with her sweating all day, even had I actually done so, there would be no trace left.

I waited for the tirade, but it never came. All she wanted was the food, and the cool drink I had put in a plastic cup. 

The drink disappeared in a single swallow. 

�I will be back for your things later, Cassie� I said, as I headed for the door. �Isn&#8217;t it much better when you obey me?�

There was no answer, but I hadn&#8217;t really expected one. I saw her pick up the plate and start eating. She was ignoring me, but that was fine. I had all the time in the world in which to get her to do as I wanted.


Cassie had been in my cellar for six weeks, and was now going to her cage whenever I told her to do.

Twice she had disobeyed me, and each time I had done as I had the first time, plunged her into darkness and turned the heating up. The second time I had left her like that for two days, and when I turned the lights back on, and told her to go to her cage, she had obeyed instantly.

She now knew that fighting me was useless. I had won one battle, but there were others still to fight.

I sat and watched her one morning as she went to the toilet, and then took a bath. So far, these had always been available to her, but I was about to change the rules.

I waited until she had finished and then turned on the microphone.

�Hello, slave� I smiled as she looked to the speaker in the cellar. �That is your name from now on. Cassie has ceased to exist, and slave has taken her place.�

I could see the anger on her face. 

�What is your name, slave�

I had turned the speaker on so I could hear her, knowing full well what to expect.

�Cassie� she screamed out at me. �My name is Cassie�

I pressed a button on my console, and a panel behind the toilet lifted up. Immediately, the toilet disappeared into a recess in the wall, and the panel came back down again. She could try all she liked, the panel would not open for her.

�When you accept who you are, you can have the toilet back. However, not for the next forty eight hours.�

With that, I plunged her back into darkness. 

I could see her through the infrared as she crawled to where the toilet had been, finding the panel and trying to get it to lift. For over ten minutes she struggled with it, but it was impossible for her to lift it. She now had forty eight hours with no toilet. I didn&#8217;t turn the heating up this time, I wanted her body to go through it&#8217;s normal functions, which would mean she would need the toilet long before I returned it to her.

�You will learn, slave, that I make the rules here. You either accept, or pay the price for disobeying. Think about that for the next forty eight hours, and we will try again then�.

I didn&#8217;t care. I didn&#8217;t have to live in the cellar, and she did.&nbsp; If she messed the cellar, she was the one who would have to live with it. And in the dark, she had to be absolutely certain where she had relieved herself, or she could step in her own mess.

I knew she could, and probably would, pee in the bath. But that would not help her with the other mess her body would produce.

I was in no mood to molly&nbsp; cuddle her. She either started to learn fast who was in charge, or suffer for it.

I totally ignored her for the next two days. I didn&#8217;t watch her on camera, didn&#8217;t feed her, and gave her nothing to drink. Even so, I knew she would need the toilet before I gave it back to her.

I waited for the two days, unconcerned as to where she had relieved herself. I turned the speakers and microphone on, but not the lights.

�How are you?� I asked.

There was no answer, but the camera picked her up cuddled up in a corner of the room, her arms wrapped around her knees.

�Look, slave. You are not going to win. I am in total control of your environment, and I can make things easy or difficult for you. The more you learn to obey, the easier your life becomes. You don&#8217;t have to think, you don&#8217;t have to do anything, as long as you obey me. That&#8217;s all it takes.�

I watched her through the monitor. She didn&#8217;t move from her corner, but she did lift her head, as if listening to me.

�I am going to ask one more time. If you want the toilet and lights back, then answer me correctly. If you choose not to do, then your bath will also disappear.�

I saw her look in the general direction of the bath. This was her only way of staying clean, and with the toilet gone, and no toilet roll, it was absolutely essential to her that she could stay clean.

�What is your name?�

I waited, listening for her reply. It was slow coming, and when she spoke, it was almost a whisper.

�My name is slave�

I had heard her, but I wasn&#8217;t happy. I wanted her to call it out.

�I didn&#8217;t hear you. What is your name?�

She looked up, not even knowing where she was really, and yelled loudly.

�My name is slave�

�That&#8217;s better. You see, that is all it took, but your defiance keeps costing you. And each time, it will get worse. Now then, tell me again what your name is�

Her voice signalled her defeat. She didn&#8217;t yell, but it was still loud enough for me to hear clearly.

�My name is slave.�

Satisfied, I turned the lights back on, and pressed another button on the console. Once again the panel moved, to allow the toilet to slide back into place, before the panel closed again.

�Very good, slave, and as long as you remember you name, you will be cared for. But I will never reward disobedience. Is this clear?�.

I had given her the opportunity, now, to behave better. It was in her own hands.

�Yes, I understand� her voice had evened out in defeat.

Now, get in your cage. Dinner will be ready soon.

I watched as she obediently clambered back into the cage, not longer even trying the lock to see if it would open.

She had long since stopped trying to get the cuffs and collar off. And now, she ignored the cage door as it closed behind her. It was being a hard lesson for Cassie, but I was in the winning side.


I decided it was time she cleaned up the cellar. She had been there for almost two months, and had started to behave herself a little better. She answered when I called out �slave� and no longer refused to go into her cage when told.

She was in the cage when I entered the cellar with the dustpan, broom and bucket of water.

�Slave� I started. �This room is a mess�

she opened her mouth as if to say something, but then thought better of it, and just looked at the things I had brought for her.

�I want it swept and mopped. Is this understood?�

I cold see in her eyes that she hated me. I could also see the rebel she was holing back. It was not out of fear of me personally that she nodded her head, but fear I would take things away from her yet again.

She bathed regularly, and ate well. but she knew that any disobedience from her, could lose her anything I chose. The last time it had been the toilet. Net time, it could be anything.

I walked out of the cellar and returned to the monitors. The broom stood where I had left it. I knew she was fighting with herself. If she did as I asked, she would be giving in, almost without a fight. If she didn&#8217;t do it, then she knew she would be punished.

I saw her reluctantly leave her cage and pick up the broom. I knew from when she was a mere housekeeper, that she was good at cleaning. But now, she had no real incentive, other than to avoid punishment.

This was the first physicals activity I had given her to do since she awoke in the cellar. And I wasn&#8217;t sure what she would actually do. If she actually did what I wanted her to do, she could keep the tools, and clean the cellar daily. If only to break the monotony. I had no idea how alone and bored she was feeling. I didn&#8217;t ask, and I wasn&#8217;t interested.

I watched for about half an hour as she slowly swept the cellar floor, putting the dust into the dustpan. I opened the microphone and told her to put the rubbish into the toilet, and to flush it. There really wasn&#8217;t anywhere else for her to dispose of it, and she knew this.

The water in the bucket had been steaming when I had taken it in, but I knew that by the time she started mopping, it would be quite cool. But still, she did a reasonable job, before throwing the dirty water down the toilet, and again flushing it.

It was strange. She had done as she was told, but I was under ni illusion that she had done it for me. Had she not wanted to do it, she would have refused, and suffered the consequences. The rebel in her eyes had told me that much.

For the next six days, without being told to do, she would sweep and mop the floor, taking the water from the bath. The cellar was clean, and I could find no fault with her. Because she was now doing it for herself, she was doing a good job of it. 

I smiled into the monitor as I watched her work away. She had no idea of the time, date or even how long she had been there. The light was on continuously unless she was being punished, and then she was in total darkness. There was no way to judge passage of time for her. I doubted that she could even describe her own face. The memory can play tricks when you are in isolation for so long, with nothing to occupy the mind.

I had considered giving her some books to read, but I decided against that. I wanted her with little or nothing to do. The cleaning she now did was her only way of breaking the monotony. 

The nights outside were already drawing in, and soon winter would be upon us. I had already decided that Cassie would have no Christmas. This was two fold. If she knew it was Christmas, it would not take her long to work out how long she had been in the cellar, giving her a vague idea of the passage of time. But nor did I want her thinking of anything that took place in the world that was no longer hers.

She was oblivious to anything happening outside her prison. Rain, snow, sun, birthdays and Christmas could all go by, and she would not be aware of them.

Her skin had paled a lot since her incarceration,&nbsp; due to the lack of natural light. But this couldn&#8217;t be helped. Until she was the slave I wanted her to be, she would stay where she was.

I felt it was time to start the next phase, and that would be the tricky one. The drug I was going to administer was slow working, and accumulative. She would need several doses even before it began to have the slightest effect. But still, time was not an issue. What I wanted would be mine, as long as I was patient.


The drug was slowly starting to take effect. She had been taking it, unknowingly, for three weeks, in her evening meal.

It was tasteless, and revolutionary. All it did was slowly remove the will to fight back in any given situation.

My brother who works in a laboratory where the drug is made, told me it was being used in prisons to quieten down the most violent of criminals. The success rate was ninety nine percent. 

His bank account was now five thousand better off, and I had enough of the drug to keep her going for three years. I thought that was a good deal. So did he. And he had not asked what I wanted it for. We were not close.

It didn&#8217;t take a lot in each of her meals, and she didn&#8217;t even know she was taking it. I had seen the effects slowly starting in her. The fire in her eyes had gone, and she was more obedient. I still thought she would escape if given the chance, but that was fine. The chance was not coming her way.

I did occasionally leave the cellar door unlocked when I was down there, and had once risked entering with her food whist she was still free of the cage.

I had seen her look at the doorway, as if working out her chances of getting out before she was caught, but though she looked, she didn&#8217;t make the effort.

Only when I left the cellar did I allow myself the smile of satisfaction.

When I had first placed her in the cellar, every time I entered, she had gone as far back in the cage as she could, trying to get away from me, her hands trying to give her a modicum of modesty. But now hat was not happening. She was so used to me seeing her naked, she no longer even attempted to cover up, and no longer retreated to the back of the cage.

Christmas was almost upon us, and upstairs, as always, I had the Christmas tree, lights and decorations up. In stark contrast, the cellar showed no signs of the festivities. It remained bleak and impersonal.

She now kept it very clean, and I had not had to punish her for ages. She had at least learned the sense in avoiding punishment if possible.

I was. As always, going to my mother&#8217;s for Christmas dinner at the end of the week.&nbsp; That would mean leaving Cassie alone for the day. I would have preferred to spend time at the house, but parents never stop moaning if you miss out on a family gathering like this one.

I doubted she would know her food was later than normal. Unless her stomach told her, but that was unlikely, I rarely fed her at the same time anyway. Twice I had actually not fed her until after midnight, but she had given no indication that she thought it was late.

My only fear, was if something went wrong with the house while I was away. I don&#8217;t know why I was worried. I was out most days at work, and nothing had happened. It was, I guess, just one of those things.

I looked in on her through the monitors, and found her yet again sweeping her room. She had started to take pride in it, and that pleased me. But before I went away, I had a job to do, and this would be where I would find out how well the drug was working.

I had been so pleased with her progress, I had decided to buy her a cot to sleep on. I had fixed strong metal rings to each corner, but that was only for later, not for now.

�Slave� I said into the microphone.

She stopped sweeping, and stood still.

�I have something for you, slave�&nbsp; I told her, but first, you have to obey me.

Cassie pout down the broom and started walking towards the cage, as she had always done.

�Stop, slave� I commanded her. In the other corner is a frame that looks like a letter A. go over to it�.

I knew she had seen it many times before, but until now, it simply stood there doing nothing. As she walked over towards it, I saw her looking around the room. I don&#8217;t know what she expected to find, or expected to happen, but nothing did.

�Slave. There are hooks halfway up each side of the frame. I want you to hook these to the rings on your cuffs, one each side.

I saw her look at the rings on her cuffs, and at the hooks. She knew instinctively, that if she obeyed, she would not be able to free herself. This was going to be my biggest risk so far, and I simply hoped I had got it right.

With a lasts look around the cellar, Cassie lifted her right arm, and took the hook in her palm. There was only just enough space for her to hook it into the ring of her cuff, and I smiled as she did so. To reach the other, she had to actually lean against the frame, and stretch her arms wide. She had already figured out that this was why she could not get free on her own. She also knew it left her defenceless against anything I wanted to do to her.

With some hesitation, I saw he left arms slowly start to move. I guessed she was weighing up the punishment she would get for refusing, against what I would do once she was helpless. I could have told her, but the fear that was reflected in her face, was worth a million pounds to me.

I heard the click, and saw her strain at the cuffs. Locked in this position, I could easily have gone in and fucked her. There would be no way to stop me, and she knew it. But that was not for yet. In time, but not yet.

Once she was secured I entered the clear and carried in the cot. She tried to turn to see what I was doing, but I was too far behind her, and she could only guess.

Assembling the cot and throwing a sheet and pillow on it, I walked over to where she stood helpless.

�Slave. I am so far pleased with your progress� I smiled at her, but the smile was not returned. At least her eyes didn&#8217;t flash a horrible death my way now.

�I have just brought you a bed. It is yours to use, as long as you continue to behave yourself. If you start to disobey again, I will remove it, and go back to punishing you. Is this understood?�

I watched as her head slowly nodded. She wanted the bed so badly after sleeping for months on the hard floor of the cage, and sometimes the cellar floor itself.

�I will let you down in a second. When you are down from the frame, I want you to make up your bed, pout the bed where you want it, and lie down on it, is this clear?�

By telling her exactly what I wanted from her, it left her no ideas of her own. It also gave her more chances to obey or disobey, leaving her that choice.

Once again, her head nodded, and I released the left hand cuff.&nbsp; She would not be able to free the other one herself, but that would give me the time to get out of the cellar and close the door long before she would, if she made a bolt for freedom.

But there was none. She released her other wrist, and turned to look across the room at the cot I had given her. It was nothing special. It had come from an army surplus store, and was basically a canvas strung between two poles, and with legs. But to her, it was always gong to be better than the floor.

I saw her fold the sheet into three, so give herself more layers, and then place the pillow at one end. She moved it to the wall opposite the toilet area, and put it where she wanted it. Almost immediately she lay down, her hands folded under her head for added support.

I smiled as she obeyed me completely. The drug was working fine, and its continued use, would keep her in this state. 


Christmas came and went, as did the new year.&nbsp; Cassie had been taking the drug for over six weeks now, and the change in her was more noticeable.

I had made several excursions to the cellar, and not closed the door, as I had taken her food down. Not once did she even make an effort to get closer to the door. More than once, she had a better chance of getting to the door before I did, even though she would not have got out of the kitchen before I would have reached her. She didn&#8217;t know this, she simply sat on the edge of the cot every time she heard the door to the cellar open.

I was ready to start the next phase. I had spoken to my brother who I had obtained the drugs from, and he had told me that the prisoners given the drug, had never returned to their former ways. As far as they were concerned, the effects were permanent. 

Once a violent prisoner had been given the full course of drugs, they were never violent again. Often walking away from a confrontation they would have once happily embroiled themselves in. when I asked how long the normal course was, he told me two months.

Cassie was two weeks away from that already, and I could see the differences.

Twice I had gone down wearing only a dressing gown, knowing that it was slightly open at the front, and she could see inside it. I expected her to turn her head away, or back away from me, but on neither occasion did she do so.

That was a start. she may have known I was doing it for a reason, but she gave no such indication. It was already in her head that I had fucked her once, early on in her stay, and also in her head that I would be doing it again at some stage. Whether or not she knew that time was getting closer, was a mystery. 

I looked around the clear, always pleased at how clean she kept it. Every time she awoke she would make the bed up ready for her next sleep, and then sweep and mop the cellar out. She could easily have eaten her food off the floor in there. 

Since she had been taking the drug, I had not had to punish her one single time. The cot had remained a feature since I had taken it in to her, and even though I had, for no real reason, told her a couple of times to sleep in the cage, she had done so. 

Where she slept, or when, meant nothing to her anymore. The cellar was her home, and she knew it. There was nothing at all in her behaviour to indicate that she had any hopes of leaving it, or even any intention.

Once I had told her when she got in the cot. To attach the rings on her ankle cuffs to the hooks on the bed. This would hold her legs open, and stop her fighting me off had I been ready to fuck her. I was ready, but I needed to wait a little longer.

Without an argument, she had done exactly as I had asked her, and then slept with them there. I could have taken advantage of her at any time I chose.

In the morning she awoke and stayed exactly where she was. She probably thought that had she released her ankles, she would be punished. And maybe, just for the sake of it, I would have done something to her. Nothing too extreme, but enough to show her that it was wrong, and unacceptable. But it was unnecessary. The hooks stayed in place until I told her she could release them.

As the days ticked by, My want for her grew. I had been patient all this time, though not without sex.

I had hired a few escort girl, and had even brought a few back to my home. I would be fucking them upstairs, whilst my true intended victim slept, unaware, two floors down.

But the time was getting closer, and I was getting more and more excited about the prospect. We would not be interrupted by her period, that had been two weeks before, the first time she had a period I had been taken by surprise. I had totally forgotten about them. But I had supplied her with tampons, and ever since, they had been there when she needed them. It also meant I also knew when her period had happened. And that was two weeks prior.

The day came slowly, but eventually, and I knew it was going to be now or never. I didn&#8217;t now how she would react, so I would make sure she was secured to the cot before I started.
She had, when told, lay on the bed and secured her own feet. I told her to put her hands towards the top of the cot, and leave them there. When she did so, I quickly hooked her cuffs to the corners of the bed. Unless I released her, she would stay like that.

I stood to one side and deliberately removed my house coat. She could see I was naked, and could also see I was already excited by what was about to happen.

What I was not prepared for, was her reaction.

As I started to lean over and climb onto the cot, I expected her to scream and struggle. Instead, her knees opened, and hips moved slowly off the bed. I was between her legs before I knew it, my cock, already hard, pressing at her pussy.

Taking a few deep breaths, I managed to regain my composure a little. I know I was breathing heavier than normal, but I had to show her I was still in command.

As I slowly started to penetrate her, I said in as firm a voice as I could.

�I am your master, slave. I own you body and soul. You are nothing but a slave, to do what and when you are told�.

Almost immediately, I rammed my hips forward, impaling her. To my surprise, her own hips came up to meet mine, and we crashed together mid air. I had intended it to be slow, to let her know who the boss was, but she met me stroke for stroke. Her head came up off the pillow her lips open, and in search of my own. I let her find them, and almost immediately, her tongue snaked into my mouth, as she pressed as hard as she could towards me. I could hear her pulling at the cuffs on her hands. Not to push me away, but in an effort to pull me closer to her.

My own hands moved under her hips, to pull them clear of the bed, as I continued to ram my cock deep inside her body. This was not what I had expected, and it took my very much by surprise. I remember thinking I should tell my brother about this side effect of the drug, but as her hips crashed against mine, that thought was soon lost. She seemed to want me as much as I wanted her. I knew I couldn&#8217;t last much longer, and could already hear as we crashed hips that her moans were deep and animalistic.

Her tongue was deep in my throat, sucking at my own, as I felt the end coming. I was intending to pull away at the last minute, but that was never going to happen. Her knees were holding me as tight as the restraints would allow them to do, and her teeth were clamped on my tongue. Not in a violent way, but enough to show she didn&#8217;t want me moving off her.

She must have known what was coming. My groans had increased in intensity, my hips were moving faster and harder, ramming deep inside her pussy. But still she did not relent, stills he held me with everything she could muster.

And then it happened. Her teeth lost their grip on me, her legs opened and closed frantically, her hips shooting off the bed, pressing my cock as far as it would go inside her.

We came together, in a blanket of pure lust. There was no end of my body and star of hers. It was a single mass of moving flesh, draining each other of all that they had.

Even when we had both finished, and I could feel trickles of our combined juices running down her legs, she still held me with her knees. Her eyes had glazed over, and her chest was heaving as much and my own.

How long we lay there, recovering, I have no idea. Eventually, I was able to prise myself out of her grip, and stand up. I wanted to release her from the cot, but I knew I had to return to my original plan. Or let her see what she had done to me in that time of utter lust.

I leaned over and picked up my dressing gown, donning it and breathing slowly and deeply, ready to walk away.

I was less than two steps away from the cot when her voice caught me, and shocked me.

It was almost a whisper, barely audible.

�Master�.

I stopped. Had I heard her correctly, or was it just me hoping.

�Master� 

The voice came again, and this time, there was no mistaking it&#8217;s origin. I turned to face her, and saw her lying with her knees wide open, her hair a mess around her head, and a smile on her lips.

�Thank you Master�.

As she said it, she turned her head away, and I could hear gentle sobbing from her. I could feel myself, the lump in my throat threatening to cut my breath off, as I walked silently away from her.

I needed to think. What had happened had taken me by complete surprise, and her words had cut right through me.

I had expected fights, tantrums and screaming from her as she was being raped. But who was raping who? 


It is now almost Christmas again, but I wont be going to the family gathering this year. Slave will be cooking my dinner for me, though she knows if she wants any, she must wait until I have eaten, and she can have what is left over.

My house has never been cleaner, and there are no more escort girls coming to visit me. 

I asked her a few months ago, what her name was. Without even thinking for a second she had replied.

�My name is slave, master. What else should it be�

she once more does my shopping for me, my washing, and makes sure I have everything I ever need. She never wears clothing in the house, though I have done nothing to try to remove the cuffs and collar she still wears.

She no longer lives in the cellar, she now sleep on the floor at the foot of my bed, and somehow manages to waken every morning before me, and has a cup of coffee ready fro when I climb out of the shower.

Though she no longer lives in the cellar, I must have the cleanest cellar in the area. Every day, without fail, she returns to it, and sweeps and mops it the way she did when she lived there. I guess, one day I will tell her she no longer needs to do so. But I think she already knows.

The cellar was where it had all started, and it holds a place in her heart. It is a special place.

I sometimes watch her through the monitor when she is in the cellar, and more than once I have seen her crawl inside the cage and curl up, looking at the camera, and smiling.

I once promised her that if she became my house keeper she would want for nothing.

She is more than that now. She is my slave, and she wants for nothing. 

Nor do I.
