Synopsis: The story of a young city girl who learns to accept a new life on the ranch.Millie's Memorable Holiday 
Part 1
Millicent C. Bender (Millie to her mom and dad, but M.C. to most of her friends)
  had a lot going for her. A very attractive and athletic young woman, she was
  the star pitcher for her company's softball team, and a good worker always
  ready and eager to jump into new assignments. Her long silky raven hair, hazel
  eyes, lithe athletic figure and a congenial personality, attracted a lot of
  attention from her male co-workers. 
Memorial Day was approaching, and M.C. was going to part with a long-standing
  family tradition. For most of her twenty-five years M.C. had accompanied her
  parents and a group of people from their church on a camping trip over this
  particular holiday, but this year she had plans of her own. 
It had been a dismal rainy Friday, and the mood at the office was filled with
  the anticipation of a long weekend making the workday seemed to last forever.
  But now it was quitting time, and M.C. was more than ready to board the train
  that would take her home for that long Memorial Day weekend. Dressed in her
  work attire, a white ruffled silk blouse, a grey pleated silk skirt that came
  down to her knees and black patent leather sandals with a conservative 3� heel
  M.C. rushed through the station as usual, she had barely found a seat as the
  train pulled slowly out of the station. 
She was always in a hurry when it came time to catch the train home, and if
  not for this particular habit of hers she may have noticed the man who had
  been shadowing her for the past week. But as usual she was focused on catching
  the first train home. And because of her plans to get away for her long weekend,
  she was in a particularly good mood, and as she settled into her seat and delved
  into the novel she had brought for the train ride home. Occasional stealing
  glimpses of the passing scenery that gradually changed from thriving metropolis
  to sprawling suburbs, she was completely unaware that danger lurked just two
  seats behind her. 
When the train pulled into her station she was pleasantly surprised to disembark
  into bright sunshine. The clouds had finally dissipated and the sun had broken
  out. The weekend was looking more promising by the minute. 
By the time she arrived at the apartment she shared with Pat her girlfriend,
  M.C. was humming to herself and looking forward to some fun and sun down at
  the shore. 
M.C. opened the door kicking off her shoes as she passed through the doorway.
  She closed the door locking it behind her, she knew she had some time before
  the arrival of her roommate and their friends, so she planned to grab a quick
  shower and change into something more comfortable before that. 
M.C. had started to unbutton her white silk blouse and was pulling down the
  zipper of her skirt when she heard the doorbell ring. She quickly pulled the
  zipper back up and hurriedly tried to redo the buttons on her blouse as she
  headed back for the door. She peered through the peephole in the door and saw
  the back of a man's head outside the door, but as she strained to get a better
  view she recognized what appeared to be the familiar brown uniform of a UPS
  deliveryman. 
M.C. knew that she wasn't expecting a delivery but maybe it was for her roommate.
  She unlocked and opened the door. The deliveryman immediately pushed his way
  past her as soon as the door was opened. M.C. didn't understand what was going
  on. Then as she looked at the man more closely, fear swept across her face
  suddenly realizing that although he wore the familiar brown shirt and matching
  brown shorts, there was no UPS insignia on his shirt and for some strange reason
  he was wearing a paper filter mask over his face. 
Finally realizing (too late) that she was in trouble she tried to yell for
  help. But in one quick motion the man had closed the door behind him and clamped
  a chloroform drenched cloth over M.C.'s gaping mouth. The pungent odor of the
  chemically filled rag quickly filled her mouth and nostrils. M.C. struggled
  as mightily as she could, but the man was too strong and soon she was as limp
  as a rag doll in his powerful arms. 
He laid the unconscious girl down on the floor then retrieved the dolly and
  carton he had left outside the door. He opened the carton and removed a small
  satchel from within it. He took out a syringe and a small vile from the satchel,
  inserted the pointy end of the syringe into the vile and extracted its contents.
  Next he grabbed a rubber tube from the satchel and applied it to M.C.'s arm
  just below the elbow. He primed the syringe then injected its contents into
  M.C.'s bulging vein. His victim would now be unconscious for hours. 
The deliveryman set about his task with expert precision, having done this
  job many times before. He began by removing M.C.'s conservative white cotton
  briefs, easing them down the length of her long slender nylon clad legs. He
  forced her mouth open and stuffed that gaping cavity with the wadded-up cotton
  briefs. He then applied a few strips of medical tape over her mouth to seal
  the gag in. 
Having just glimpsed the thick black silky hair that covered M.C.'s delectable
  little cunt, he was determined to see what else the girl had to offer. He took
  a handful of white silk in each hand then pulled viciously in opposite directions,
  some buttons gave way easily while others popped violently causing small white
  missiles to fly about the room. Next her lacey black bra was removed freeing
  her ample boobs. Then, after removing the grey silk skirt he stood admiring
  the beautiful dark-haired girl now stretched out before him, with her black
  satin garter belt and the shear black hose offering absolutely no protection
  from his lurid glare. 
Next he removed several lengths of a good quality nylon rope from the satchel
  and quickly set about binding his motionless victim into a tight little ball
  that he could fit inside the empty carton. He began by grabbing both slender
  stocking clad ankles and tying them together one crossed over the other. Then
  he forced her body forward; she bent easily at the waist. He spread her knees
  apart and continued to press forward. When he found that he was able to force
  her head to her crossed ankles he released her and grinned sardonically as
  her body uncoiled. 
Now, he arranged her arms so that he could draw them inside her knees, after
  fastening one end of a rope to her right wrist he firmly took hold of each
  of her wrists and placing a knee in the center of her back forced her limber
  body to double up on itself once again. This time, however, her arms were drawn
  back as her head was forced down. Once he had her head resting on her ankles
  he took the rope that already wrapped one wrist and captured the other. He
  forced her wrists as close together as possible and tied them off behind her
  back. His victim was now secured with her arms drawn under her legs and caught
  behind her back and her head resting on her bound ankles. 
M.C. would not have imagined that her years of yoga training would lead her
  into to a position quite like this. The lifeless young lady who's 24� waist
  bent so easily into this pretzel shape, with her 38� breasts now pinched between
  her compressed shoulders and thighs and her beautiful hazel eyes hidden behind
  closed eye lids was now ready for boxing. Her head turned to one side and pressed
  into the ropes binding her ankles. The deliveryman had bound her 5'7� frame
  into a cute little 117 lbs bundle of femininity that he had no problem placing
  into the awaiting box. 
The satchel was placed inside the box with M.C., and then he cut some strips
  of strapping tape and sealed up the box. The package was placed on the dolly,
  rolled to the elevator and then out of the building. As he rolled the package
  down the sidewalk Pat and two of her friends were approaching. The nondescript
  deliveryman passed the approaching threesome with neither taking much notice
  of the other. He opened the back of the large brown truck parked on the street,
  loaded the package and dolly inside the vacuous vehicle, and then after locking
  the back doors proceeded to the drivers seat. 
�Hey Bill you really cut it close on this one, that was the roommate and their
  two friends you passed on your way to the truck.� 
Bill looked over his shoulder through the open drivers-side door of the truck
  and glimpsed the gorgeous trio just before they entered the building. �We may
  have to make another trip out here Sam, those three look pretty promising.� 
Sam, the man who had been trailing M.C., had to agree. 
End of Part 1
&nbsp; 
Part 2 
M.C. awoke to total darkness. The drug she had been given was finally wearing
  off after nearly fourteen hours. She was still groggy and not totally aware
  of her situation. Her first thought was that she needed to get a move on and
  get ready for her trip. She tried to stretch and shake off the cobwebs, only
  to find that movement was impossible. 
Suddenly she remembered the deliveryman bursting into her apartment and the
  foul smelling rag that was placed over her face. Panic set in and she tried
  to scream. The panties that were stuffed in her mouth were not the most efficient
  of gags. 
Bill and Sam heard the muffled screams generating from the box. They exchanged
  knowing smiles. 
Slowly, as consciousness was restored the aching in her muscles made her bitterly
  aware of stress her limbs were under. The aching in her head left little doubt
  in her mind that she had been drugged, and what was that terrible taste in
  her mouth. 
Then she became aware of the motion of the truck, this did nothing to suppress
  her panic attack. In fact the movement of the truck was combining with the
  after affects of the drugs to create a queasy feeling in her stomach. She desperately
  tried to fight back the urge to vomit. 
She didn't realize it, but she was nearly at the end of her journey and thousands
  of miles from her home. The delivery van had proceeded to the airport where
  the package had been loaded onto a private plane. Which had flown through the
  night landing in Boise Idaho a little more than two hours ago. The box containing
  M.C. now occupied the back of a mini-van that was just now turning into the
  drive of the Bar Star Ranch many miles outside of Boise. 
A big burly man dressed in a white tee shirt and bibbed overalls sat on the
  porch of the ranch house and rose to meet the approaching mini-van. 
�Well if it ain't Billy-boy and Sammy, you got a package in there for me?� 
�You bet, and a pretty one she is too.� 
�Well let's not dawdle boys there's work to be down. Drive her on over to
  the barn and we'll get started.� 

Joseph �Top� Springer, the big
    burly man from the porch, walked ahead of the mini-van and opened the barn
    doors for Bill and Sam. After driving the van into the barn Bill and Sam
    unloaded the box from the back. Top pulled his handy �Buck� pocketknife and
    split the taped seams of the box. Then Bill and Sam removed the pretzel shaped
    girl from the box. 
Top started laughing, �Billy-boy, you sure can tie �em. How'd you ever get
  her into that position?� 
Bill grinned, �She's pretty limber Top. Sam's research indicated she had been
  doing Yoga for years, and I just wanted to see how flexible she might be.� 
�Well boy that's one pretty little package.� 
M.C., her eyes blinking from the sudden influx of light was still groggy from
  the drugs and trying to suppress an increasing nausea within her stomach listened
  to the men's banter with ever increasing anxiety. She attempted to communicate
  with her captors, but she was able to achieve only a muffled and garbled utterance
  that her captors neither tried to acknowledge nor interpret. 
�Well darlin' it would seem you have somethin' on your mind. But, that's neither
  here nor there. You and I are going to get real well acquainted, but ole Billy-boy
  here and Sammy there have to be going, ya' see there's another package due
  next week.� 
Bill and Sam each pocketed an envelope from Top and proceeded to the mini-van. �See
  you next trip Top�. 
�Well now cutie, it's just you and me. You know, as much as I like lookin'
  at you all tied up like that, it just ain't too practical to leave you that
  way.� He pulled out his trusty �Buck� flashed its' blade in front of her wide
  eyed face, then with a couple of quick slashing movement Bill's handy work
  lay limp on the ground and M.C. slowly unfurled. 
Before M.C. could fully regain her equilibrium, Top had grabbed her wrists
  forced them behind her and secured them there with a hinged pair of handcuffs. 
�Okay cutie, I'll take the gag off ya' now, ain't no one gonna' hear you out
  here. Any way you're gonna' have to learn to keep your mouth shut on your own.� 
Top removed the tape, and then the saliva soaked panties. Looking at the panties
  he chuckled to himself, �That ole Billy-boy hee-hee-hee-hee.� 
Now that the gag had been removed, M.C. could hold down her nausea no longer
  and a gusher of puke spewed from her mouth. 
As M.C. retched her guts out Top just laughed, �you made a real mess here
  girlie, good thing for you we're still in the barn and you didn't do it on
  me. Here ya go, take these they'll relieve the nausea.� 
M.C. didn't trust him or the pills. She shook her head violently and clamped
  her mouth shut. 
�Ah, feelin' a little frisky, huh,� with that Top grabbed a handful of dark
  hair yanked her head back then pinched her nose shut until she opened her mouth
  he released her hair grabbed the pills and popped them into her gaping mouth
  then massaged her throat until he felt the pills work their way down her slender
  throat. �That'll ease your stomach,� he gruffed. 
M.C. was surprised when in fact the pills did what Top had said they would,
  in a matter of minutes the nausea that had beset her stomach had dissipated,
  only to be replaced by a new feeling of light-headedness. 
Top watched patiently as the girl's eyes slowly glazed over leaving her with
  a kind of blank stare. Then he placed a collar around her neck attached a leash
  and said, �Come on girl.� 
M.C. docilely followed along, she was filled with a weird sensation, she felt
  like she was a balloon on a string that just floated along behind Top as he
  lead her away. 
Top led the dazed girl to the
    back of the barn and through a small door that entered into a very modern
    clinical looking room. The room had a large examination table in its' center
    and rows of cages lining the walls on the left and right sides. At the other
    end of the room was another door with cabinets aligned to either side. M.C.
    was lead to the table. 
�Get up there on that there table girl� 
M.C.'s dazed mind could not resist, she struggled slightly to raise herself
  up onto the table, her hands being locked behind her back making the task more
  difficult than it would have been otherwise. Top removed the collar and handcuffs,
  and then the garter belt and stockings her last vestige of clothing were also
  removed. 
�I can appreciates ole Billy-boy's sense of style, but you ain't gonna' have
  no further need of any kinda' clothing girly.� 
�No need of clothing?� The thought resonated in M.C.'s muddled head. 
Top then took out a cloth tape measure and took some readings of his new acquisition's
  neck, wrists and ankles. Having jotted the measurements down on small note
  pad he left the girl sitting on the table as he went to one of the cabinets
  at the far end of the room. He returned with five metal bands, the bands looked
  similar in shape except for size. To the naked eye they looked like solid bands
  with D ring on one side, but in fact they sort of resembled a woman's a rather
  plain bracelet hinged on one side and a hidden locking mechanism on the other. 
Top picked up a clipboard that dangled from the end of the table, �Hmmm, Millicent
  is it, age 25, height 5'7�, weight 117 lbs. measurements 38�24�34�. I'll just
  bet your folks called you Millie and that's just what I'm gonna' call you.
  Millie these here (he pointed to the bands) may look like ordinary lil' bracelets
  to you but they ain't. You're gonna' find they have some very special attributes.� 
Millie sat trance like on the table hearing every word Top uttered but unable
  to respond. 
He picked up the largest of the bands, and using the tip of his always handy �Buck� to
  depress a tiny button on one side of the band, it sprang open in his hands.
  He lined up one half at the nape of Millie's neck then closed the other half
  (the D ring aligned in front) until with a click it encircled her pretty little
  neck. 
�Now the first amazing aspect about this little doodad is that when I press
  this here little button a kinda electronic welding goes on inside that locks
  it permanently around that pretty white neck of yours.� He pressed the button
  and a slight whirring sound could be heard. When it stopped, he said; �Now
  that little trinket ain't never comin' off.� 
The words �never comin' off� registered on Millie's befuddled brain and somewhere
  a loud and profound �NO� echoed within its' confines but she remained powerless
  to respond, sitting quite motionless as Top went on. 
He took the other four trinkets and fastened them just as permanently to her
  wrists and ankles. 
�Now Millie we start early round here so I'm gonna let you rest up some, your
  trainin' starts first thing in the mornin�. 
�Get yourself down from that table now. That's a good girl�, he patted her
  on the head, �now down on your hands and knees.� 
Millie's mind was still reeling as she thought: �What, down on my hands and
  knees like some kind of dumb ani� anim� animal�, and again a resounding �NO� rang
  through her muddled brain as she obediently dropped down on all fours. 
�Good girl,� he patted her head again. �Now, come on girl�. He directed her
  to one of cages. 
In her mind Millie rejected every word Top spoke to her, but she still felt
  herself floating along like a balloon, and she was powerless to resist any
  order Top had to give her. 
Top opened the cage, �Good girl�, and with a pat on the rump �inside you go.� 
Millie's mind was just not functioning, she kept thinking, �I can't be doing
  this�, and yet found she was powerless to resist, she crawled obediently into
  the cage still wondering: �Why?� 
Top closed and padlocked the cage door leaving her alone. 
�Sleep tight Millie, mornin' comes early�. 
And although Millie hadn't really felt tired she curled up in the cage and
  fell into another deep sleep. 
End, Part 2 
Part 3 
When morning came, Top returned to the barn to find Millie still asleep in
  the cage. The rest of the farm was bustling with activity the hands where going
  about their chores of milking cows, feeding livestock and grooming ponies.
  Top stood in front of Millie's cage holding a small remote control in his hand.
  He pressed one of the buttons on the remote, and watched as Millie's body suddenly
  contorted violently, wakening the sleeping beauty. 
Millie arched in pain, then tried to raise her aching body from the curled
  up position she found herself in. But the cage prevented her from standing
  erect she could only get up on her hands and knees. The poor girl slowly regained
  her senses, and then surveyed her surroundings wondering to herself, what was
  going on. 
Millie's brain desperately tried to sort things out. Obviously, she realized
  that she was naked and confined to a cage, but how had this happened to her.
  Slowly her fuzzy brain began to clear, and she remembered there had been a
  deliveryman at the door, she remembered opening the door, something being held
  over her face and then darkness. Just as she was recalling being bound inside
  a box her body arched again in pain. 
The pain was generating from her neck wrists and ankles. 
�Well, I see sleepin' beauty is finally awake.� 
Millie turned toward the voice, she vaguely remembered seeing the face before. �Who
  arrrrr�� The pain shot through her body again. 
�Your first lesson lil' girl is you do not speak without permission.� 
Another shock coursed through Millie's body. 
�Is that understood, lil' girl?� 
Millie cowered in the corner of the cage, shaking like a leaf and slowly nodding
  her head. She did not try to talk again. 
�You have a lot to learn girlie, so get used to the fact that you belong to
  me and I'm gonna do whatever I want with you.� 
Millie just cowered in the corner of the cage and remembered Top as the man
  who had provided the pill that made her nausea fade away. 
�This is a workin' ranch and everybody and everything has a job to do. Is
  that clear girlie?� 
Millie forced herself to nod. 
Top then unlocked the cage. �Come on out girl.� 
Millie shook her head no. Her body instantly arced in pain again. Reluctantly
  she crawled out of the cage and started to stand up, only to double up in pain
  once again. 
�Animals don't walk on two legs, now get down on all fours.� 
Millie instantly dropped to her hands and knees then froze. �He just called
  me an animal, this just can't be happening to me?� 
�We raise four kinda animals on this ranch ponies, dogs, milk cows and beef
  cows, and those there 38� jugs of yours mean you'll be trainin' as a milk cow.� 
Top attached a leash to Millie's collar and gave a tug. Millie noticed the
  remote in Top's other hand and Top's thumb poised above one of its buttons.
  The poor girl quickly analyzed her options, dropped her head and reluctantly
  followed his lead. 
Millie was lead back to the examining table and ordered to climb up on it. 
Top secured Millie to the table using the �D� rings on her collar and cuffs. �Your
  new life will require a few modifications to that cute lil' bod of yours.� Unable
  to move Millie watched as an oxygen mask was placed over her nose and mouth,
  and within minutes she was fast asleep. 
Millie's eye blinked open, and she found that she was still secured to the
  table. She stared straight up at the ceiling but she could feel a few things
  that felt different. Something heavy was resting on her lips; there was numbness
  in her nose. She could feel the coldness of the metal table at the back of
  her head, and her pussy felt cool and more sensitive. 
�I can tell by that confused look on your face, that you've noticed some changes
  have been made to that sweet lil' bod of yours. So, let me fill you in lil'
  girl.� 
� Since your diet will now consist of mostly grains and supplements your teeth
  have been capped and shaped to make it easier to grind those raw grains. Your
  jugs have received the first of a regimen of injections that will increase
  their size and their ability to produce milk. A depilatory was used to make
  your body completely devoid of hair except for your eyelashes. And that weight
  you feel pressing against your lips is a big ole ring that goes right through
  your septum. 
Millie's eyes grew larger and larger as Top explained how she had been �modified� until
  they welled up with tears and she sobbed uncontrollably. 
�Now there ain't no use in cryin over spilt milk, what's done is done.� Top
  released the crying girl from the table. �Let's go now, down off the table.
  Time to introduce you into the herd.� 
Millie was not thinking as she swung her legs over the table and started to
  stand. Top's finger quickly depressed a button on the remote, and Millie collapsed
  reeling in pain on the ground. 
Millie forced herself onto her hands and knees as Top approached carrying
  a heavy chain. He attached the chain to the ring in Millie's nose and led her
  away. 
Top led the still sobbing girl out into the barnyard. The tears had made Millie's
  vision a bit blurry so she wasn't sure she could believe what she was seeing. 
First she saw a team of four young women about her age, their heads bald except
  for a long knot of hair that came down their backs like a horses mane. They
  were all in harness with their arms bound tightly behind their backs and they
  were hitched to a carriage. The driver of the carriage cracked a whip and four
  women high stepping in unison started to draw the carriage off. 
As they approached the barn, she saw a kennel, but along with the dogs in
  the kennel there were about a dozen young women their hair groomed to look
  like the ears of a dog down on all fours just as she was and each girl had
  the same metal collar and cuffs that she bore, but they were barking and playing
  just like the real dogs. 
Upon entering the barn Millie saw many more women all near to her own age
  and all just like her completely hairless down on all fours again with the
  same metal collar and cuffs around their necks, wrists and ankles. Some of
  the women were feeding from a trough, others were in stalls with shiny metal
  machines attached to their utters as they were drained of their milk. 
�Well Millie this is your new home. Just one more thing to do and you'll be
  a member of the herd.� 
Top continued to lead the girl through the barn and out into an area behind
  it. There she saw a row of pens each contained a woman down on all fours like
  herself, but these women appeared to a be little older and a lot meatier. Then
  it hit her Top had said they raised four kinds of animals on the ranch and
  she had seen the ponies, dogs and the milk cows so these could only be � beef
  cows. The thought echoed in her mind along with a resounding NOOOOO! 
On the other side of the pens she saw another small pen that sat out in the
  open. Top led right to this pen, and then in to it. Once inside Top pulled
  her head through an opening at the front and locked it in place. He slid a
  bar over her back and then a set of bars was closed at the back of the pen
  trapping her inside. It was then that she saw the brazier set up with several
  irons heating up inside, Millie suddenly realized what that last thing was
  that Top mentioned he had to take care of was. She was about to be branded.
  She started shaking uncontrollably as the tears welled up in her eyes once
  again 
Top took his time turning irons as they rested on the coals. Finally he pulled
  one of the irons out and blew on it. It glowed a bright golden orange. He brought
  glowing iron to the pen and applied it the Millie's lily-white rump. 
Millie let out a scream that was primal in its nature. 
Top knew that the new cow Millie wouldn't be ready for milking for another
  week or so. So she was led back to the barn placed in a stall and given her
  first taste the grain feed. Millie didn't like the look of the feed much less
  the taste but since Top hovered in front of, remote in hand, she tried to eat
  the unpalatable stuff. 
A stable hand secured her in her stall after she was fed, and then he introduced
  her to her secondary function on the ranch, that of fuck toy for any and all
  of the ranch hands. Millie made the mistake of objecting when he started fondling
  her cunt. In an instant she felt the pain as the electric current ran through
  her body emanating from her neck, wrists and ankles. 
The stable hand showed Millie the remote control he held in his hand. �What's
  your problem, ya' dumb cow, don't ya' know cows don't talk, cow's moo.� He
  gave her another jolt just to drive home the point. Then proceeded to rape
  and bugger her. When he finished with her hind end he walked around to face
  her and then he forced her to clean his cock off with her mouth, before ejaculated
  a load his cum deep inside her throat. �You'd better learn to like cum cow,
  it's the only thing you're gonna get to eat round here besides that grain feed
  you seemed to like to well.� 
Millie cried herself to sleep. 
By mid summer Millie's utters had grown a full four inches and she was producing
  milk at the required rate. 
As the summer passed into autumn Millie became a fairly contented cow. She
  eventually even began to look forward to the sexual attentions of Top and the
  stable hands. And during that first winter she became pregnant, and it was
  hoped she would give birth to a healthy female calf in the spring. 
So as spring arrived after the long cold winter had confined the cows to the
  barn, a very pregnant Millie, her belly and utters nearly dragging on the ground,
  was led out into the barnyard for some welcomed fresh air. 
The barnyard was abuzz with excitement, as the Top and the hands prepared
  for the first Barbeque of the season. 
Because she was pregnant the hands gave Millie a little extra care, and she
  was occasionally allowed out of the barn on her own. Millie had been curious
  about the women penned up outside the barn, so when she was free she would
  wander over to the pens. 
She had not seen these women except for that one time. She wondered if they
  had been force to spend the winter outside in the pens. From what she could
  see the women never left their pens. They were not milked like she and the
  other milk cows were and the stable hands seem to leave them alone except to
  feed them and do something she couldn't quite make out, but it seemed like
  they were being given some kind of massage. 
On the day of the barbeque Millie and a few of the other pregnant cows were
  allowed out in the fields by the barn. As they bathed in the sun and lay in
  the tall sweet smelling grass Millie watched as two of the ranch-hands opened
  two of the outside pens. The ranch-hands then led two of the women out of the
  pens by their nose rings. As Millie had noticed before these women looked just
  like the other cows, but they were a bit older than she (maybe by about ten
  or fifteen years) they were also heavier looking not obese just bigger. 
She fixedly stared as the two cows were led over to the barbeque pits. Millie
  watched as they forced the cows to bend their heads down to the ground and
  then forced their arms behind their backs and locked their wrist cuffs together.
  The two ranch-hands who had led the women out now stood each with one heavy
  boot pressing into nape of the neck of their respective charge forcing the
  cows to remain in their kow-tow position. 
Two more ranch-hands approached the cows from behind, each caring a long pointed
  metal rod. Then Millie's jaw dropped as she watched what happened next; each
  man lined up his target with his rod and then slowly started to force his rod
  up anus of his cow. Both cows struggled against these unwelcome invasions.
  But their struggles were to be in vain. Once the spits had navigated their
  way through the two victims and exited through each ones mouth the two cows
  struggled no more. The ranch-hands finished by fastening each cows ankle cuff
  over the spit and carried them over to the cooks. 
The cooks quickly gutted, stuffed and dressed the two cows then slid guide
  rods on the ends of the spits. They positioned the long rods with the cows'
  cunts before forcing them home then they tightened the setscrews on the guide
  rods to the spit so that the beef would turn as the spit rotated. Now each
  cow was positioned over a red-hot bed of coals. The cooks tended to the beef
  basting and poking the meat as it cooked. 
Millie watched all of this and for the first time since her branding started
  to cry. Millie realized this would probably be her fate and the fate of the
  other cows when they no longer could meet their milking quotas. 
Later that day, after the barbeque, the ranch-hands rounded up the cows that
  were still out in the field and they herded them back to the barn. As Millie
  was being herded past the kennels she happened to look over and she could not
  believe her eyes. There in the kennel was her former roommate Pat O'Riely with
  her red hair coifed to look like a Cocker Spaniels ears panting like a dog
  with her tongue hanging out as a big Rottweiler humped her from behind. 
Tears welled up in Millie's eyes once more as she let out a very sad, and
  very long and low Moo.
