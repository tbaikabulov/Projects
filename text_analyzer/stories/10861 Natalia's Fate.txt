Natalia's Fate
Provided By: BDSM Librarywww.bdsmlibrary.com
Synopsis:  Natalia finds herself waiting for the bus after work one minute and then bound in a dark and dank room the next.






Natalia woke up in a dark small room. She was chained to the floor, a shackle around her ankle. How did she get here? The last thing she remembered she was sitting at the bus stop after work. She just finished her shift as a waitress. Natalia then realizes she is no longer wearing her waitress uniform; instead she is in a white simple dress. It comes down about two inches from her panties and a deep V neckline, highlighting her small mounds, her cleavage. It is a spaghetti strap dress that cinches in the middle, showing off her curves. She is also barefoot. Then she hears a key turning in the keyhole of her prison door. Natalia holds her breath, not knowing what to expect. A man about 6&#8217;5� comes looming in, ducking under the small door frame. He is of medium build overall, but she can see his pecs and biceps straining at the confines of his cotton t-shirt. He has dark, full head of hair and a definite five o&#8217;clock shadow, a trace of a beard and moustache. He towers over Natalia.
�This is how it is going to work� you have been carefully selected. Colleagues of mine have been casing your joint for weeks. When our operatives realized you have no family to account for your whereabouts, your fate was decided. It was just a matter of time in the planning of when and how to snatch you. My superiors also had to decide, based on your life, what you would be best suitable for.� He paused and continued on, but avoiding eye contact at this point, �I&#8217;m sorry to have to inform you that it has been decided you&#8217;re a prime candidate for our top client, Ivan.� From the look on his face, she knew this was an impeding look of doom, to be feared.
�The upside of this is, you will be treated well after your, um, &#8216;date&#8217;.� She felt overwhelmed with fear; she knew he hadn&#8217;t told her everything about her fate. He continued on, �That is *if you survive.� The silence between them was ominous. It didn&#8217;t take long for it to sink in that death is at the door. She didn&#8217;t know what would lead to it and she was pretty sure she didn&#8217;t want to know. He explains, �He likes to tie up his women and whip them bloody. He is a sadist. He likes to inflict pain. If you- survive, he will then cut you down from your restraints and savagely rape you. He is a biter and loves to choke his women. I will be outside the bedroom door. If it is too much, you can call for me, but I would strongly advise against it. It may infuriate him and he can be loose cannon. If that happens, nothing can stop him, not even me. I&#8217;m not allowed to use any physical restraint on our clients. It is best to just take it. If you pass out, he may lose interest. As I was saying, the upside is I can take you to our infirmary and take care of your wounds. Hopefully, infections will be avoided. And you will never have to suffer at the hands of Ivan again. He likes to inflict pain on women who are unprepared with the depths of his power, for the lack of a better word.�
Ominous is no longer a word for it, it is a death sentence. When will all this happen? Just thinking of it makes the pit of her stomach turn. If she had even a half empty stomach, there is no doubt she would&#8217;ve thrown up everywhere. When did she eat last? He seemed to know from her expression what is going on in her mind. �Don&#8217;t worry� we make certain the girls have not eaten for this reason alone, when given this kind of news. It gets quite messy. Again, I know it is not much of a consolation� but you survive this, you will be treated well. You will have one week to yourself before you have to worry about entertaining clients again after you heal. And you will be a &#8216;regular girl&#8217;, meaning you will be auctioned off to service regular men on a daily basis.� Regular men? But she knew he meant no more fucked up sadistic psychos. Guess that is a step up in this dark underworld.
He then continued on, �You&#8217;re the exception to the rule. You&#8217;re Asian. You&#8217;re high in demand. You would&#8217;ve been spared of this situation just because Asians are our highest commodity, but Ivan wanted an Asian this time. Even women who survive Ivan are no longer considered valuable. They may bring a few extra bucks, but they are auctioned off to lower class men, men with similar tastes as our friend Ivan or worse. They don&#8217;t pay millions like Ivan, of course. Those women do eventually succumb to death because the human body can take only so much. But since you are Asian, we are considering to try to see how it goes in the regular group versus the scumbag group.� He continues, �Tonight you will be taken to be showered, re-dressed and made up, the picturesque of beauty. Then I will drive you to the &#8216;Party house&#8217;. I will hand you over to Ivan after all the other festivities are done� the auctions and the sex deals.� Why the wait, why all this anticipation necessary? She thought. As if he could read her thoughts, he continues, �He loves anxiety building within the girl. He knows it is tortuous. He&#8217;s a sadistic son of bitch. After, I hand you over; you will be in his hands for as long as he wishes.�
�I know what you are thinking� You want to know how I can do this, very simple, money. I never said it was easy, just simple. I don&#8217;t mind helping my fellow man enjoy himself to the fullest, but creeps like Ivan, is scary no matter what the deal is. Now, I will leave you to rest because you will need it.� He turns to leave and then turns to face Natalia, �I do wish you the best tonight. I hope you can maintain and get through this. It is a very painful way to die.� And with that he shuts the door behind him.
Natalia tries not to let her imagination run wild as they pull up to the house. The man whom she has been in communication with, she soon discovers his name is Jason because she overheard another man address him as such. Jason escorts her out of the van. She is no longer chained in shackles like before, but she makes no attempt to escape, it has been driven into her what will happen if she does try. Natalia is re-dressed in the dress she found herself waking up in. They enter the house; it is filled with women dressed in the same exact dress that she is wearing, except they have a zipper that runs from top to bottom in the front and hers doesn&#8217;t. Each woman is escorted by a brawny man dressed in black, a handler. There are many men dressed in their Sunday best, talking amongst each other with a drink in one hand. All the men are smiling as they exchange pleasant small talk with one another and at the same time stealing glances at the women with lust lingering within their quick gazes.
After about a half an hour of polite conversations, a man in a white suit goes to the front of the room to a microphone. He is a clean cut man that stands at 6&#8217;2�, he clears his throat to quiet everyone and gain their attention as he is about to speak. �Good evening, gentlemen, my name is Marcus and welcome to my house party. We will be starting the festivities shortly. I just wanted you to take the next few minutes to roam the room and get a closer look at the merchandise. Feel free to touch and taste, this includes kissing and licking, poking and prodding if you will as long as it is over the dress and not under. Enjoy.�
Men anxiously and hastily begin to roam the room to start sampling the women that they were once limited to leering at. A few men approach Natalia and Jason who are now standing near a door that is closed. Jason steps in front of Natalia and simply states, �This one is spoken for.� Natalia cringes at the impersonal phrase �This one� yet relieved to have Jason&#8217;s protection until she realizes it won&#8217;t last long. One man replies, �I don&#8217;t remember reading anything in the handbook about merchandise being spoken for before the auction.� �This is Mr. Kapovich&#8217;s merchandise,� responded Jason, in a strong hard tone. Some of the men back off immediately and throw looks of sympathy towards Natalia. This unnerves her to her very core. They know what this man is capable of; she can see it in their eyes. The man who addressed Jason looks perplexed. �You must have not read your copy thoroughly or you would know the rules on Mr. Ivan Kapovich and you must not know what he is capable of. Let me explain,� another man nearby starts to say as he guides him away.
Marcus returns to the front of the room and goes to the microphone to speak. �Gentlemen, gentlemen, may I have your attention? We are about to start," he announces. He turns a bit to his left as a burly man dressed in the "uniformed" black of a handler guides a beautiful redhead about 5'10" and voluptuous. "We have the lovely Daria. She is a great party girl, she has been with us for only a year now, so she knows what she is doing. Very skilled in the arts of sexual gratification. We will start the bidding�� he begins, but Natalia is not listening at this point, she is trying her best to tune everything out.
Fear is building within her. She even closes her eyes as he starts to unzip Daria&#8217;s dress, exposing her "goods" for the lustful men in the room. A few �ohhhs� and �ahhhs� can be heard throughout the room. Natalia hears one man on her left, whisper to another man near him, �That pussy is ripe for a pounding, don&#8217;t you think?� The other man chuckles. Natalia continues to try to tune out everything and everyone around her.
After all the women are auctioned off, the great big doors on the other side of the room are opened and the men escort the women they bought and paid for through the door. There are many beds on display through out the room. Men are leading the women to the beds. Some beds are hidden behind enclosed screens for privacy, some beds are adorned with a white opaque lacy material like a canopy and others are simply just out in the open. Men and women start to engage in various sex acts and sexual intercourse. Time ticks by slowly for Natalia. She turns her head away from the buzz of activity. She focuses on the door next her. A man about 4'9�, almost a foot shorter than herself and with patches of hair and he is big in size, approaches. He reminds her of the character �Boss Hog� from the Dukes of Hazzard. �That is our room, my sweet pussy,� he strokes her neck and chin, forcing her to look at him. He continues, �I have been looking forward to this for a very long time. I am sure you will be worth every cent I paid. I will enjoy watching you writhe in pain. I am looking forward to sucking on those pert nipples of yours that have been teasing me all night long as they poke at your dress. And that-,� he pauses for a second and as he finishes his sentence, he slides his free hand up her leg and inner thigh, �delicious, nectar of,� he begins again to say. He roughly rams his stubby fingers past her panties and into her and says, �pussy!� as he continues with his other hand, to stroke her along her cheek and neck and down the side of her breast and squeezing her nipple hard, causing chills to run through her as well as quick sensation of pain.
The time passes and then the moment is upon her. �Natalia, I must escort you and help secure you to the cross,� Jason informs her. Was there a hint of remorse in his voice? Her whole body tightens in anxiety. She starts to perspire a little. Her mouth goes dry and she is numb with nerves. He opens the door and signals for her to walk in as she walks in she notices that Ivan is already there, sitting in a chair in front of the cross. When did he come in? Is she really so detached right now she did not see him enter the room? There is no other door. She looks quickly around the room for hope of a last minute reprieve from this situation and she notices the carpet is several shades of red. What a weird design for a carpet. What? Wait. That&#8217;s not a design� that&#8217;s, blood! The �Blood Room�, she heard whispers of it earlier tonight, she just wouldn&#8217;t let it register, fear clouded her thoughts at the time. She started to hyperventilate. Jason kept whispering, �Breathe. Breathe, you need to. Otherwise, you will just only anger him. You need to get through this or it will be worse for you.� He escorts her to the cross and purposefully ties her hands above her head.
�What a beautiful sight this is. I&#8217;ve been looking forward to this for a very long time, my dear. You will be my first Asian delight. I will look forward to sampling you tonight,� Ivan starts to say. He gets up from the chair and walks over to Natalia and runs his hands up and down, all over her body and basks in delight as she flinches at his touch. �What a masterpiece, don&#8217;t you think?� he asks Jason without his beady eyes leaving the trail he continues to blaze on Natalia&#8217;s body. Jason just gives him a nod; it is obvious to Natalia Jason feels uncomfortable. �You may leave. I want to be all alone with her now.� Jason leaves, but refuses to look at her even though she is willing him to with her silent eyes.
�Oh, baby, you are a present to be unwrapped,� Ivan says to Natalia. He continues to run his hands, lightly up and down her body and suddenly he roughly grabs her breasts and then pinches them merciless. She squeals in anguish, and so it begins. Tears streaming down her face. He entwines his puggy fingers in her hair and yanks back hard. �Oh baby, squeal like a baby pig, honey. No one will hear you and even if they do, they won&#8217;t do anything to help you. I paid them handsomely to do this,� he hisses in her ear, harshly. She could feel his hot, dank breath on her neck. �You are mine and to do with what I please. You will scream my name on top of your lungs and beg for mercy, except it won&#8217;t be there for you to have, sweetheart,� he taunts cruelly. He releases his hold on her and then he steps forward again and puts his hand on her shoulders. Ivan abruptly rips the dress from her body, leaving her to feel exposed and vulnerable. She can feel his breath on her back. She hears movement behind her and then a few moments of silence. She then hears the unmistakable sound of a whip cracking the air behind her. The moment of doom has arisen. Her skin begins to crawl�
Hours later she lays still on the floor, soaked in her own blood and bodily fluids. She is shaking like a leaf. She is freezing, but not shaking due to coldness. Natalia is numb with overwhelming pain. Actual tears would be a relief about now, but there are none to be had. She is almost lifeless. Natalia then feels a warm, thick and soft blanket wrapped around her broken body as she is gently picked up off the floor. Jason&#8217;s even breathing calms her and then she blacks out again.
Natalia is rudely woken up with renewed pain. A man dressed in a white lab coat is hovering over her. He gently, yet firmly pushes her back to the mattress of the bed. �Good, you do not have any nerve damage. I know it is painful, but you are alive, I can&#8217;t say that for all of Ivan&#8217;s girls. You will heal with time. You will continue to go in and out of consciousness, but that is your body&#8217;s way of dealing with otherwise, unbearable pain. You will heal. That man should be locked up and the key should be thrown away. Unfortunately, I have no say, not when I am just as guilty. I know I should give all this up, but I&#8217;m in over my head now. Embrace my destiny, enjoy the money and all that jazz,� says the doctor, more to himself than her. Natalia sees some movement in the room, she focuses and sees Jason. There is a look on his face. Is it regret, remorse, indifference? Then she blacks out again.
When Natalia regains consciousness this time, she realizes she is on her way to healing because she knows the pain is subsiding greatly and this time she doesn&#8217;t feel like she is going to lose consciousness anymore. She looks around the room; it is just a simple room, four walls that have no color to them and a door. There is a window, but there are bars on them. Natalia already knows without a doubt the door is locked and secure or at the very least a man guarding the outside door. She shifts a little underneath the covers and winces in pain. Natalia lifts the blanket up and sees she is wearing a makeshift hospital gown. She pulls on the gown away from her body and sees ugly markings on her breasts and around her nipples and then she hears the door opening and in walks the doctor.
�Don&#8217;t worry about the marks on the front of your body. They will heal. I have some great medicines that will help and you probably won&#8217;t scar either. From what I understand he was very impressed by your nipples, so he was gentle.� Gentle? How can he say that? �I see the doubt on your face. He was gentle with you, at least with the front part of your body. You did take a great beating to your back. The whips did their job just as he likes. Your back is a different story. There will be some scarring, nothing can be done about that, I am sorry. But you are lucky,� he informed her. Lucky?!? She is mystified, how can he say that?
�It is true, you are,� said a voice off to the side of the room. Natalia followed the voice with her eyes and saw that it was Jason talking and read her expression, therefore was able to answer her unspoken question. He continued, �I&#8217;m afraid other women did not fare as well as you. One girl, was unrecognizable, and if she�� He didn&#8217;t have to finish that sentence she already knew the poor soul had died, literally at the hands of Ivan. She could even tell Jason regretted telling her.
Time passed and Natalia had time to relax once her wounds were fully healed. The doctor was right; she did not scar on her chest at all. She dared look at her back and regrets looking at the angry criss cross marks. She cried many tears, but more out of remembering how they came to be. What bothered her more than anything was how he ravaged her body as she lay there bleeding. He taunted and teased her. Ivan would scream at her, encouraging her to crawl away from him only to yank her back by her hair into his greedy little grasp, hopping on top of her, shoving her legs out his way. He would ram his fingers up inside her repeatedly without a care in the world, while he choked her. He would gouge his fingers into her flesh, twisting her breast in an unnatural way, scratching her breasts as he came inside her as much as the condom would allow. When he came again, he bit her on the neck, drawing a few drops of blood.
�I would bite or suck off your nipples, but then there would be nothing left to play with, so I will have to restrain myself, which I am not used to. I do NOT like restraining myself, Natalia! You must be punished for this!� he would shout. He grabbed her roughly, not caring that she could barely stand from the pain he has already inflicted thus far. Ivan dragged her to his chair and threw her over his lap. He began spanking her hard on her bare butt, occasionally slapping her pussy lips. It began to burn and sting. She cried out each time his resounding hand hit her. �Beg me to stop. Yell out my name!� he shouted at her. She knew this is not what he really wanted her to do, at least she knew he would not ease up if she did what he told her to do. She knew in her heart that he wanted a reason to punish her even more, so she held her tongue. Then he&#8217;d dig his fingers into her open wounds in her back as he slapped her ass at the same time. She screamed like never before, yet not his name or to beg. He leans into her and whispers with his hot, rancid breath enveloping her, �Good, girl.�
Ivan starts rubbing and slapping her ass and occasionally her pussy lips and after he would intermittently shove his fat fingers inside her vagina and her anus relentlessly. With his free hand he would yank her hair. �NOW, yell me name!� he demanded. �Mr. Kapovich!� she shouted in gasps of air between tears. �No, my first name, my little pussy puppet!� he shouts back. �Ivan!� �Now, beg me to spank you more!� Ivan demanded, tauntingly. Spank me more? How can I take more pain? She thought to herself in agony. When she didn&#8217;t comply right away, he rammed his fingers in her and spanked her clitoris hard. �Please, spank me. Please!� she shouted. He would spank her even harder. She cried in big heaving tears. �That&#8217;s my good girl, you thought I would ease up, didn&#8217;t you? Just because you complied with my wishes. You are mine to do with what I want,� he explained harshly. He reached up and grabbed her around the throat squeezing as he landed a resounding pound with a board on her red ass that he picked up, leaning against the leg of the chair. All of the sudden he threw her from his lap and she landed on the carpet facing up and he spewed his juices all over her body. �Fuck, yes! You fucking pussy!� he cried out and he finished spilling the last of his seed all over her. He saw her close her eyes and thought she passed out and he then left the room. When she came to, she looked up and saw Jason standing there with an expression she couldn&#8217;t quite place with her vision blurred with tears spilled and tears yet to be spilled. She whispered, �Jason� and then passed out...
Jason entered the room. The expression on his face is very somber, this can&#8217;t be good. Not at all. Natalia stiffened, the hairs on the back of her neck stood up. He took a seat on her bed next to her. �Let me start off by telling you that you have brought in more money for us than any girl, in fact, a group of girls altogether. You have still managed to turn heads and be the source of hard-ons in a room. It is your spirit as well as your beauty,� he starts to say. �What are you talking about? My spirit? My spirit left me when Ivan left me on the floor of the Blood Room. My beauty? He beat that out of me,� Natalia replies. �Honey, you are still very beautiful. As for your spirit� ok, maybe I have to agree with that. But there is something about you, that is- haunting�� He stopped and took a deep breath and took her hands into his, sandwiching them. Jason looked away and he felt her hands go cold. She knew. Natalia started to tremble, she had no tears left, which ironically was painful to endure than to just simply cry.
Jason refused to look at her as he felt her eyes on him. �You said�,� she started. �I know what I said, but I don&#8217;t have any control over this. He wants you again. He sees that the men still want you. I think- I think what he does to women is his way of marking his territory. Since men still want you, he feels his territory has not been efficiently marked. He sees you at the auctions and sees you still go for a very high price. Men are clamoring to have you, this made him jealous. Angry,� Jason, tries to explain. �If he is angry, that anger is going to be directed at me! I cannot go through this again. He&#8217;ll kill me, Jason,� Natalia respond. �Do NOT say my name!� he shouts as he pulls back. He continues in a softer voice, �I know. Believe me, I know.� �You cannot possibly bring me back to that sick son of bitch!� Natalia shouts, at that moment a burly man came flying through the door and grabs Natalia by the hair. He shouts, �You will NOT talk about our clientele, using such language. You are just merchandise, you will stand down, you wet slit!� �Karl, I&#8217;ve got this. You need to go, if you damage the merchandise, you will have to deal with Mr. Kapovich. You don&#8217;t want to do that, do you?� Jason says. Karl turns around, grumbling about how he needed to take a walk to cool off.
Jason turns to Natalia and says, �I heard you say my name just before you passed out. Since then whenever I hear someone say my name that image of you, broken, comes to mind. It broke me too." He paused, then continued, "I am leaving this all behind me after�� �After you see this last request through?� Natalia asks for confirmation. He nods his head, he takes her hand and turns it, palm up and places two white pills in her hand and securely wraps her fingers around them. �You have a choice,� he whispers softly and leans into kiss her on the forehead. Jason gets up to leave, refusing to look back at her. He says as he walks out the door, �It was hard to hear you say my name, I knew you were reaching out to me for solace and it hurt not to be able to give that to you, now maybe I can. This will be even harder though, I have grown fond of you, beyond lust. You haunt me as well as every man who comes in your wake, sexually yes. But deeper than that, respect and the need to protect you. You will always haunt me to my dying day.� He softly closes the door behind him.
