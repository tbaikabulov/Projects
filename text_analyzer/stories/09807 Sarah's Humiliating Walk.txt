Synopsis: Sarah is walked like a dog  college.






Sarah�s heart pounded as she ran to college. How did she manage to oversleep? The entire college had been warned only yesterday that a new punishment would be brought in for lateness. She arrived over an hour late and was spotted at the gate by her Principal Mr Smith.

Mr Smith had an unsettling grin on his face as she approached.
�Miss Green, so nice of you to join us today. Do you realise what the time is?�

Sarah stumbled over her words as she apologised. �I�m sorry sir it wont happen again. �I had a problem with my alarm and my Dad had already gone to work��

�I am not interested in your excuses Sarah. You know that we�re bringing in new punishments to stop late students? Tomorrow morning I will come to your house at 6.30am. I want you to be ready for me so that I can make sure you get to college on time. At the end of the college day I will take you home. Understood?�

 �Yes Sir.� She tried to hide her surprise. That was it? The dreaded punishment that they had been warned about in assembly? She lived in a small town and it normally only took her 20 minutes to walk to college so it looked like she would only endure an early morning detention as college started at 8..

�Go to class now Sarah, you�ve already missed enough.� Sarah had tried but failed to hide her relief at what seemed like a light punishment. But it had been harder for her Principal to hide his excitement. Sarah was a stunning young 18 year old. With shiny wavy blonde hair and a beautiful but strong face, that he looked forward to taming in the morning. She was slender and athletic which would be an advantage to her. �He knew she was a good girl and he couldn�t remember the last time she was in trouble. She was smart and got good grades. If he set an example of her the students would know that no one was safe. She was also too confident for her age and deserved a lesson in humility.

Sarah took her seat in Geography after apologising to her teacher. She was mostly a popular student although some people disliked her intelligence and thought she was a teachers pet. They liked the fact she was late and were disappointed that all she was getting was an early detention.

Kerry was disgusted �I got a detention just for forgetting a book and that�s all you get for being late.�

Kerry didn�t like Sarah who she thought was stuck up. She�d also been dating Jack recently who Kerry fancied and she couldn�t believe Sarah would dump him.

�You probably kissed up to the teachers again didn�t you. Teachers pet!�

�Shut up Kerry. Just because you�re too dumb for the teachers to like. They could have given me more detentions but hey I don�t need the study time.�

They often argued and Sarah remembered how jealous Kerry had been of her and Jack. It hadn�t lasted long. Jack was too clingy and she had to firmly tell him to get leave her alone. �I want a nice guy not some irritating boy who follows me around everywhere like a sick puppy dog� she had told him.&nbsp; �You need to be more decisive and proactive. Your grades are awful I can�t date someone with no ambitions� He had eventually taken the hint, she found him dumb and boring and now tried to avoid him.

The rest of the day passed uneventfully and she went home for a good nights sleep so that she wouldn�t be tired when the Principle came in the morning.

Morning came and she waited for her principle in her front hall. She was dressed smartly in her yellow plaid college dress which came down to just above her knees and she wore a white shirt underneath. She had knee length white socks and her black shoes were freshly polished to try and please Mr Smith.

She answered the door quickly when her Principal arrived grinning broadly and Sarah smiled thinly back. Closing the door behind him. His smile was making her nervous.

�Good morning Sarah I�m glad to see that you�re up on time. Now you will protest at this but you either face this morning�s punishment or get expelled. Then what hope will you have in the work place? Do you understand?�

Sarah nodded, times were tough had dad was struggling having been recently made redundant and he wanted her to do well at college. He was picking up any job he could which is why he had left at 4am to get paid minimum wage and she didn�t want a life like that

�I am going to show you no respect like you did at the college yesterday. This public humiliation will be a warning to everyone else, to work hard for their studies.� With these words he pulled out a big brown ball with straps attached.

Sarah looked stunned, her beautiful mouth hung open. �What is that, what do you mean humiliation?�

�Keep that mouth open Sarah, I am not interested in anything you have to say during your punishment�

Sarah obeyed and as he put it to her mouth she realised that it was a gag. She tried to speak but only faint moans came out. There was a click and her beautiful brown eyes widened, startled as she realised it wouldn�t come off. She tried pulling at it anyway and Mr Smith laughed dangling a key in front of her.

�If you won�t listen to me when I tell you not to be late, why should I listen to you?�

He then put light steel cuffa on her wrists and ankles and told her to get down on all fours. Sarah trembled as she wondered what was going to happen to her. Mr Smith took out two thin metal chains which attached her wrist cuffs to her ankle cuffs and then a shorter chain between cuffs and ankles, then he locked them in place. He had given her enough room to move so that she wouldn�t crawl too slowly, but they were too short to let her stand up. Sarah was in a daze not believing what was happening but when a collar with a leash was clicked and locked around her neck she started to struggle.
The principal grabbed the collar and pulled her head roughly to the floor. �Listen bitch, because that�s all you now are. A female dog under my control until I decide to release you. You won�t be hurt unless you disobey me, you will learn to obey the rules!�

Sarah was crying and pleading with her eyes but Mr Smith�s carefully concealed anger had been shown and she knew she must obey. Mr Smith tightened her back pack so that it wouldn�t slip; he then cuffed away the tears irritably and opened the front door. The sunlight flooded the hall way and Sarah flinched from it. Terrified of the idea of being seen outside like this.

�What a beautiful morning� he said, cheerful again. And he had every reason to be cheerful this beautiful little blonde teenager was under his control and was going to be taught a lesson. It always frustrated him to have lots of difficult teenagers that he couldn�t discipline properly. But now he�d secured permission from the council to apply more extreme measures to deal with misbehaviour.

He stepped out and tugged on the leash. Sarah hesitated; she didn�t want anyone to see her like this. It was a small town with lots of people who could recognise her and see her humiliation. 

She tried to give Mr Smith one more pleading look but he laughed and said �Hurry now you don�t want to be late for college.� college! It suddenly seemed so far away, and most of the students would take the same route, she�d have to try and get there as quickly as possible. She took a deep breath (which was difficult with a ball gag) and put her hands out of the door. After another moment of hesitation her legs followed. Her house door was slammed and locked behind her by Mr Smith who waited for her to start, savouring her fear.

Sarah took one last look at the door and then set off. She wanted to crawl as fast as possible but she soon realised how difficult crawling is. Her hands and knees were already sore before she had passed just a couple of houses. She then fell forward in her haste and her principal gave a horrible laugh. 

�Nice panties� he said. Sarah blushed she was a modest girl but the skirt wasn�t designed for crawling in. She tried to pull it down a bit which made him laugh even more. She started crawling again and it was slow going. Mr Smith was now ahead tugging on the leash. He wasn�t in a hurry but he enjoyed showing his control over her. She felt so humiliated being leashed like this. Just like some dumb animal.

A car beeped and Sarah flinched. Then another beep and another. Cars were slowing to see the extraordinary sight. Sarah looked at her hands as she tried to crawl as fast as possible but then gave a huge jump at another mans voice speaking right in front of her.

�What the�?� It was a big dark haired man who gave Sarah a quizzical look as she knelt there frozen in shame. The man looked at her principal. 
�Punishment for her behaviour at college� Mr Smith explained.
�Good, I�m glad to see someone doing something about these little brats. He gave Sarah a scornful look and walked on.

More people stopped and stared as she crawled slowly on. Her principal was relaxed acting like it was a normal day, responding to greetings and explaining what he was doing. It was a busy main street and there were plenty of people to watch her humiliating crawl.

�Dude who�s this bitch?� a young rough looking man in a leather jacket came up to them smoking a cigarette. Sarah huddled against her Principals leg in fear.

�Just a bad teenager that I�m teaching a lesson�

�Good for you man. You need a lesson don�t you darling� To Sarah�s horror he started stroking her gorgeous blonde hair with his greasy hands.
I�m not a dog her brain pleaded. I�m not!

�GRRRR!� it had come out by accident as the mans stroking hand moved down her back and brushed her bottom.

Principal Smith burst into laughter but still pushed the man back. �Hey none of that� The man moved off. Sarah knelt, frozen in shock and Mr Smith tried to control his fits of laughter. �You sounded just like a dog then, ha-ha, learning you�re role now are you?�

Sarah hadn�t meant to growl but he had been groping her.&nbsp; What else could she do? �It was so frustrating not being able to speak. Was everyone going to lust after her?
She started crawling again, it felt like hours since they had left her house but she realised with horror, that they weren�t even a quarter of the way to college. She tried to pick up the pace but Principal Smith was going slowly, constantly tugging her back deliberately frustrating her with delays like reading a notice or looking at a flower. 

People kept patting her head and stroking her, as they passed often laughing as they did it. She loathed every touch and wanted it to end. She had never been this embarrassed before and she fought to control the tears which she thought would just cause more laughter.

Her head snapped back again as the collar around her neck went taught. She looked back and saw with horror that her principal was tying her leash to a post. 

�No dogs allowed� he explained pointing at a caf� sign. �Just stopping for a quick coffee and a chat�

She shook her head and tried to say no. Please no she groaned moving towards him but then the leash went taut again. She felt pathetic, just like a dog eagerly waiting for its master. But she was scared, she hated him so much for doing this to her. But she was terrified to be without him; he was her only protection against a world which was so much more frightening when she had to crawl through it with cuffs a collar and a gag.

People walked past and stared and stroked and patted her. It was even worst humiliation to be tied alone. Like some forgotten mongrel unworthy of its owners time.

Her Principal eventually returned and patted her head. Without realising what she was doing at first she craned her head to his touch like a faithful companion. She was so relieved that he was back. Her eyes had closed for a moment and when she opened them she saw his grinning face and drew back with repulsion. He laughed and then tugged hard on her lead.

�Hey there�s our Principal and he�s walking a student�

No, please no! Sarah thought. The students were coming now and they laughed and pointed and jeered. She saw some people she thought were friends and felt betrayed as they laughed. The principal smiled and explained this was the punishment he�d warned us about. He also warned them to keep walking to college or face punishment themselves. That made them move on but new groups kept arriving and Sarah felt even worse, being humiliated in front of other students.

Eventually they entered the college and headed to the principles office. Mr Smith took out his keys and unlocked Sarah, finishing with the gag. It felt wonderful to move her mouth again and to stop crawling after an hour and a half. 

�Come here at the end of the college and I�ll take you home.� 

Sarah was surprised at how calm he was. As if they had had a normal stroll to college.
She wanted to beg him to let her walk home normally but decided to wait until the end of the day. He might change her mind if she was well behaved.

Chapter 2
Sarah knocked timidly on the Principles door.
�Come in, hello Sarah have you had a good day?�

The day had been horrible with all of the students laughing at her, taunting her and making dog noises. But she just said

�Please sir can I��

�No� he cut her off. �I�ve been looking forward to taking you home. Now get down on your hands and knees.�

Sarah sighed and got down. When she was back in the cuffs and gag again Mr Smith put on the collar. �You look so beautiful my bitch.�

He led her out of her office where the teachers enjoyed the sight of her beautiful young body crawling through the halls. Most of the students were at the gate and cheered as they saw her. Sarah tried to hide behind the Principal which caused fresh laughing and he tugged her back around into view.

Principal Smith asked if they would all be at college on time from now and they all chorused �Yes!� They then walked with them as Sarah crawled.

�Teachers pet! Teachers pet!� they shouted finding it hilarious. The principal told them to go home as they came to her font door. Sarah was relieved to be so close to safety. But then to her horror she saw Jack. Her ex boyfriend who she�d broken up with which had made him very angry. She tried to move away as he reached out a hand to stroke her but the Principal held her on a short leash.

�Sir, please can I take her off your hands? I think she needs an extra lesson on how to treat men and she was horrible to me when we broke up. She told me I needed to be more ambitious so that�s what I�m doing here� 

Sarah�s heart began beating fast again with fear and she trembled. The Principal was one thing but at least he was a grown up who should take care of her. What would Jack do?

�Ok� he Principal said. He was a friend of Jacks father and thought the boy deserved revenge. �Ok come here.� They left Sarah in the middle of the pavement as they moved to one side and whispered together.

�You�re going with Jack now bitch! I think exercise is one area you need to improve and Jack will give you plenty. He�ll have you home tonight, make sure your not late in the morning. � He patted her and strolled off whistling.

Sarah looked up at Jack and he said 
�Let�s unlock you�

She smiled with surprise around the gag. He was being nice she�d misjudged him. He knelt down with the keys and held her waist as if to support himself. He then let out a horrifying laugh and began spanking her. The Principal had explained the rules to him as they whispered together. This included no physical harm such as beating her but he decided a quick spanking was ok. He didn�t hit her as hard as he could have done but it was still incredibly painful. She was now filled with terror. What was he going to do? 
�24�25...26� Jack finished. �One for every day I wasted dating you.�

Sarah shook with fear and Jack laughed to feel her trembling in his arms. 
�Come on bitch�

He yanked hard on her lead taking her at a fast pace away from her house. Away from freedom. Her bum stinging, arms and legs aching from a day of crawling. She struggled to keep up but she received a spank if she stumbled so she did her best. 

�Now look whose following like a sick puppy dog.� he grinned and Sarah shuddered as he quoted her words back to her.

They were going to the park and Sarah saw with horror that Kerry waited for them with a look of triumph on her face. She gave Jack a long kiss and then snatched the lead from him.
�Well well Miss high and mighty. Look at you now. You didn�t think we were good enough but we�re both better than you. Now you get to be our pet on our first date together.�
They started to walk again, many of the college students were there watching and jeering again. Sarah walked alongside and was steered towards a large puddle. Jack and Kerry jumped across it but Sarah was forced to crawl through it and get .�Should we take her home� Jack said.
�No she�s too clever to need study time. She can stay out and enjoy time with us.�

She loves this Sarah thought. They got to parade her around the park, the ultimate humiliation for Jack�s ex girlfriend as he was with his new girl. They kissed, they talked. On and on and on. Sarah was really bored; they really were dumb, their conversation made her want to yawn. But there she was unable to say anything with this stupid gag in her mouth. They sat down and talked for hours, occasionally stroking Sarah. But then Sarah realised she needed to pee. What could she do? She couldn�t wet herself even if being led to the toilets was embarrassing. She began to pull on her leash nodding towards a nearby building which contained toilets.

�What is it?� Jack was irritated.
�I think she needs the toilet.� Kerry said and they both giggled.
�As long as it�s not a number two. I�m not bagging it and putting it in the bin.� Jack stood up and to Sarah�s horror walked to the bushes. �You�re a bitch now remember.
Kerry followed so that she could watch the humiliation. They didn�t turn around and Sarah was forced to lower her panties and pee in front of them. They found it hysterical. 

They came back and tied her leash to a branch and talked some more. Sarah was really frustrated. It was torture to lie there bored, being treated like a dog and having aching limbs. She was starving, Kerry had brought a picnic which Sarah looked at enviously.

Sarah was getting chilly as it got late and eventually Jack and Kerry stood up to go.
�Nice spending time with you Sarah �Jack grinned and they moved to go without her.

�MMMMPTH�Sarah groaned. They couldn�t leave her here could they? Jack had been told by the Principal that they had to take her home but Sarah didn�t know that.

�Ahhh she likes us and wants to come with us� Kerry grinned.

�Ok if she wants to come she�ll have to beg� he looked into Sarah�s eyes, �Beg! Like a dog!�
Sarah felt sick; having to beg to these two was the worst part of the day. But then she imagined what would happen if she was left here at night so she squatted on her knees lifted her hands like they were paws and whimpered like a dog.
They burst into laughter again but demanded that she didn�t stop so she continued whimpering and pleading with her eyes. She was red faced with humiliation it was so degrading. She promised herself never to make these sounds again. They came close and made here rub her body around their legs like a dog. Still whimpering.

Eventually they took her home; Jack chucked the keys at her, and then left her in the hallway without another word. She unlocked herself, then got into her bed and cried.










Sarah&#8217;s heart pounded as she ran to school. How did she manage to oversleep? The entire school had been warned only yesterday that a new punishment would be brought in for lateness. She arrived over an hour late and was spotted at the gate by her Principal Mr Smith.

Mr Smith had an unsettling grin on his face as she approached.
�Miss Green, so nice of you to join us today. Do you realise what the time is?�

Sarah stumbled over her words as she apologised. �I&#8217;m sorry sir it wont happen again. �I had a problem with my alarm and my Dad had already gone to work��

I am not interested in your excuses Sarah. You know that we&#8217;re bringing in new punishments to stop late students? Tomorrow morning I will come to your house at 6.30am. I want you to be ready for me so that I can make sure you get to school on time. At the end of the school day I will take you home. Understood?�

�Yes Sir.� She tried to hide her surprise. That was it? The dreaded punishment that they had been warned about in assembly? She lived in a small town and it normally only took her 20 minutes to walk to school so it looked like she would only endure an early morning detention as school started at 8..

�Go to class now Sarah, you&#8217;ve already missed enough.� Sarah had tried but failed to hide her relief at what seemed like a light punishment. But it had been harder for her Principal to hide his excitement. Sarah was a stunning young 16 year old. With shiny wavy blonde hair and a beautiful but strong face, that he looked forward to taming in the morning. She was slender and athletic which would be an advantage to her.

�You probably kissed up to the teachers again didn&#8217;t you. Teachers pet!�

�Shut up Kerry. Just because you&#8217;re too dumb for the teachers to like. They could have given me more detentions but hey I don&#8217;t need the study time.�

They often argued and Sarah remembered how jealous Kerry had been of her and Jack. It hadn&#8217;t lasted long. Jack was too clingy and she had to firmly tell him to get leave her alone. �I want a nice guy not some irritating boy who follows me around everywhere like a sick puppy dog� she had told him. �You need to be more decisive and proactive.

Morning came and she waited for her principle in her front hall. She was dressed smartly in her yellow plaid school dress which came down to just above her knees and she wore a white shirt underneath. She had knee length white socks and her black shoes were freshly polished to try and please Mr Smith.

She answered the door quickly when her Principal arrived grinning broadly and Sarah smiled thinly back. Closing the door behind him. His smile was making her nervous.

�Good morning Sarah I&#8217;m glad to see that you&#8217;re up on time. Now you will protest at this but you either face this morning&#8217;s punishment or get expelled. Then what hope will you have in the work place? Do you understand?�

Sarah nodded, times were tough her dad was struggling having been recently made redundant and he wanted her to do well at school. He was picking up any job he could which is why he had left at 4am to get paid minimum wage and she didn&#8217;t want a life like that

�I am going to show you no respect like you did at the school yesterday. This public humiliation will be a warning to everyone else, to work hard for their studies.� With these words he pulled out a big brown ball with straps attached.

Sarah looked stunned, her beautiful mouth hung open. �What is that, what do you mean humiliation?�

�Keep that mouth open Sarah, I am not interested in anything you have to say during your punishment.�

Sarah obeyed and as he put it to her mouth she realised that it was a gag. She tried to speak but only faint moans came out. There was a click and her beautiful brown eyes widened, startled as she realised it wouldn&#8217;t come off. She tried pulling at it anyway and Mr Smith laughed dangling a key in front of her.

If you won&#8217;t listen to me when I tell you not to be late, why should I listen to you?

He then put light steel cuffs on her wrists and ankles and told her to get down on all fours. Sarah trembled as she wondered what was going to happen to her. Mr Smith took out two thin metal chains which attached her wrist cuffs to her ankle cuffs and then a shorter chain between cuffs and ankles, then he locked them in place. He had given her enough room to move so that she wouldn&#8217;t crawl too slowly, but they were too short to let her stand up.

Sarah was crying and pleading with her eyes but Mr Smith&#8217;s carefully concealed anger had been shown and she knew she must obey. Mr Smith tightened her back pack so that it wouldn&#8217;t slip; he then cuffed away the tears irritably and opened the front door. The sunlight flooded the hall way and Sarah flinched from it. Terrified of the idea of being seen outside like this.

�What a beautiful morning� he said, cheerful again. And he had every reason to be cheerful this beautiful little blonde teenager was under his control and was going to be taught a lesson. It always frustrated him to have lots of difficult teenagers that he couldn&#8217;t discipline properly. But now he&#8217;d secured permission from the council to apply more extreme measures to deal with misbehaviour.

He stepped out and tugged on the leash. Sarah hesitated; she didn&#8217;t want anyone to see her like this. It was a small town with lots of people who could recognise her and see her humiliation. 

She tried to give Mr Smith one more pleading look but he laughed and said 
�Hurry now you don&#8217;t want to be late for school.School! It suddenly seemed so far away, and most of the students would take the same route, she&#8217;d have to try and get there as quickly as possible. She took a deep breath (which was difficult with a ball gag) and put her hands out of the door. After another moment of hesitation her legs followed. Her house door was slammed and locked behind her by Mr Smith who waited for her to start, savouring her fear.

Sarah took one last look at the door and then set off. She wanted to crawl as fast as possible but she soon realised how difficult crawling is.

She felt so humiliated being leashed like this. Just like some dumb animal.

A car beeped and Sarah flinched. Then another beep and another. Cars were slowing to see the extraordinary sight. Sarah looked at her hands as she tried to crawl as fast as possible but then gave a huge jump at another mans voice speaking right in front of her.

What the? It was a big dark haired man who gave Sarah a quizzical look as she knelt there frozen in shame. The man looked at her principal. 
Punishment for her behaviour at school Mr Smith explained.
Good, I&#8217;m glad to see someone doing something about these little brats. He gave Sarah a scornful look and walked on.

More people stopped and stared as she crawled slowly on. Her principal was relaxed acting like it was a normal day, responding to greetings and explaining what he was doing. It was a busy main street and there were plenty of people to watch her humiliating crawl.

Dude who&#8217;s this bitch? a young rough looking man in a leather jacket came up to them smoking a cigarette. Sarah huddled against her Principals leg in fear.

�Just a bad teenager that I&#8217;m teaching a lesson.�

�Good for you man. You need a lesson don&#8217;t you darling?� To Sarah&#8217;s horror he started stroking her gorgeous blonde hair with his greasy hands.
I&#8217;m not a dog her brain pleaded. I&#8217;m not!

�GRRRR!� it had come out by accident as the mans stroking hand moved down her back and brushed her bottom.

Principal Smith burst into laughter but still pushed the man back. �Hey none of that� The man moved off. Sarah knelt, frozen in shock and Mr Smith tried to control his fits of laughter. You sounded just like a dog then, ha-ha, learning you&#8217;re role now are you?�


Sarah hadn&#8217;t meant to growl but he had been groping her. What else could she do? It was so frustrating not being able to speak. Was everyone going to lust after her?
She started crawling again, it felt like hours since they had left her house but she realised with horror, that they weren&#8217;t even a quarter of the way to school. She tried to pick up the pace but Principal Smith was going slowly, constantly tugging her back deliberately frustrating her with delays like reading a notice or looking at a flower. 

People kept patting her head and stroking her, as they passed often laughing as they did it. She loathed every touch and wanted it to end. She had never been this embarrassed before and she fought to control the tears which she thought would just cause more laughter.

Her head snapped back again as the collar around her neck went taught. She looked back and saw with horror that her principal was tying her leash to a post. 

�No dogs allowed� he explained pointing at a cafe sign. Just stopping for a quick coffee and a chat�

She shook her head and tried to say no. Please no she groaned moving towards him but then the leash went taut again. She felt pathetic, just like a dog eagerly waiting for its master. But she was scared, she hated him so much for doing this to her. But she was terrified to be without him; he was her only protection against a world which was so much more frightening when she had to crawl through it with cuffs a collar and a gag.

People walked past and stared and stroked and patted her. It was even worst humiliation to be tied alone. Like some forgotten mongrel unworthy of its owners time.

Her Principal eventually returned and patted her head. Without realising what she was doing at first she craned her head to his touch like a faithful companion. She was so relieved that he was back. Her eyes had closed for a moment and when she opened them she saw his grinning face and drew back with repulsion. He laughed and then tugged hard on her lead.

�Hey there&#8217;s our Principal and he&#8217;s walking a student�

No, please no! Sarah thought. The students were coming now and they laughed and pointed and jeered. She saw some people she thought were friends and felt betrayed as they laughed. The principal smiled and explained this was the punishment he&#8217;d warned us about. He also warned them to keep walking to school or face punishment themselves. That made them move on but new groups kept arriving and Sarah felt even worse, being humiliated in front of other students.

Eventually they entered the school and headed to the principles office. Mr Smith took out his keys and unlocked Sarah, finishing with the gag. It felt wonderful to move her mouth again and to stop crawling after an hour and a half. 

�Come here at the end of the school and I&#8217;ll take you home.�

Sarah was surprised at how calm he was. As if they had had a normal stroll to school.
She wanted to beg him to let her walk home normally but decided to wait until the end of the day. He might change her mind if she was well behaved.

Chapter 2
Sarah knocked timidly on the Principles door.
�Come in, hello Sarah have you had a good day?�

The day had been horrible with all of the students laughing at her, taunting her and making dog noises. But she just said

�Please sir can I�

�No� he cut her off. �I&#8217;ve been looking forward to taking you home. Now get down on your hands and knees.�

Sarah sighed and got down. When she was back in the cuffs and gag again Mr Smith put on the collar. �You look so beautiful my bitch.�

He led her out of her office where the teachers enjoyed the sight of her beautiful young body crawling through the halls. Most of the students were at the gate and cheered as they saw her. Sarah tried to hide behind the Principal which caused fresh laughing and he tugged her back around into view.

Principal Smith asked if they would all be at school on time from now and they all chorused 
�Yes!� They then walked with them as Sarah crawled.

�Teachers pet! Teachers pet!� they shouted finding it hilarious. The principal told them to go home as they came to her font door. Sarah was relieved to be so close to safety. But then to her horror she saw Jack. Her ex boyfriend who she&#8217;d broken up with which had made him very angry. She tried to move away as he reached out a hand to stroke her but the Principal held her on a short leash.

�Sir, please can I take her off your hands? I think she needs an extra lesson on how to treat men and she was horrible to me when we broke up. She told me I needed to be more ambitious so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing here.�

Sarah&#8217;s heart began beating fast again with fear and she trembled. The Principal was one thing but at least he was a grown up who should take care of her. What would Jack do?

�Ok� the Principal said. He was a friend of Jacks father and thought the boy deserved revenge. �Ok come here.� They left Sarah in the middle of the pavement as they moved to one side and whispered together.

�You&#8217;re going with Jack now bitch! I think exercise is one area you need to improve on at school and Jack will give you plenty. He&#8217;ll have you home tonight, make sure you&#8217;re not late in the morning.� He patted her and strolled off whistling.

Sarah looked up at Jack and he said 
�Ok I&#8217;m going to unlock you�

She smiled with surprise around the gag. He was being nice she&#8217;d misjudged him. He knelt down with the keys and held her waist as if to support himself. He then let out a horrifying laugh and began spanking her. The Principal had explained the rules to him as they whispered together. This included no physical harm such as beating her but he decided a quick spanking was ok. He didn&#8217;t hit her as hard as he could have done but it was still incredibly painful. She was now filled with terror. What was he going to do? 
�24�25...26� Jack finished. �One for every day I wasted dating you.�

Sarah shook with fear and Jack laughed to feel her trembling in his arms. 
�Come on bitch.�

He yanked hard on her lead taking her at a fast pace away from her house. Away from freedom. Her bum stinging, arms and legs aching from a day of crawling. She struggled to keep up but she received a spank if she stumbled so she did her best. 

�Now look whose following who like a sick puppy dog.� he grinned and Sarah shuddered as he quoted her words back to her.

They were going to the park and Sarah saw with horror that Kerry waited for them with a look of triumph on her face. She gave Jack a long kiss and then snatched the lead from him.
�Well well Miss high and mighty. Look at you now. You didn&#8217;t think we were good enough but we&#8217;re both better than you. Now you get to be our pet on our first date together.�
They started to walk again, many of the school students were there watching and jeering again. Sarah walked alongside and was steered towards a large puddle. Jack and Kerry jumped across it but Sarah was forced to crawl through it and get wet. Sarah was tiring and finding it harder to keep up despite the constant pulls on the leash.
�Should we take her home� Jack said.
�No she&#8217;s too clever to need study time. She can stay out and enjoy time with us.�

She loves this Sarah thought. They got to parade her around the park, the ultimate humiliation for Jack&#8217;s ex girlfriend as he was with his new girl. They kissed, they talked. On and on and on. Sarah was really bored; they really were dumb, their conversation made her want to yawn. But there she was unable to say anything with this stupid gag in her mouth. They sat down and talked for hours, occasionally stroking Sarah as they kept her close. But then Sarah realised she needed to pee. What could she do? She couldn&#8217;t wet herself even if being led to the toilets was embarrassing. She began to pull on her leash nodding towards a nearby building which contained toilets.

�What is it?� Jack was irritated.
�I think she needs the toilet.� Kerry said and they both giggled.
�As long as it&#8217;s not a number two. I&#8217;m not bagging it and putting it in the bin.� Jack stood up and to Sarah&#8217;s horror walked to the bushes. �You&#8217;re a bitch now remember.
Kerry followed so that she could watch the humiliation. They didn&#8217;t turn around and Sarah was forced to lower her panties and pee in front of them. They found it hysterical. 

They came back and tied her leash to a branch and talked some more. Sarah was really frustrated. It was torture to lie there bored, being treated like a dog and having aching limbs. She was starving, Kerry had brought a picnic which Sarah looked at enviously.

Sarah was getting chilly as it got late and eventually Jack and Kerry stood up to go.
�Nice spending time with you Sarah� Jack grinned and they moved to go without her.

�MMMMPTH� Sarah groaned. They couldn&#8217;t leave her here could they? Jack had been told by the Principal that they had to take her home but Sarah didn&#8217;t know that.

�Ahhh she likes us and wants to come with us� Kerry grinned.

�Ok if she wants to come she&#8217;ll have to beg� he looked into Sarah&#8217;s eyes, �Beg! Like a dog!�
Sarah felt sick; having to beg to these two was the worst part of the day. But then she imagined what would happen if she was left here at night so she squatted on her knees lifted her hands like they were paws and whimpered like a dog.
They burst into laughter again but demanded that she didn&#8217;t stop so she continued whimpering and pleading with her eyes. She was red faced with humiliation it was so degrading. She promised herself never to make these sounds again. They came close and made here rub her body around their legs like a dog. Still whimpering.

Eventually they took her home; Jack chucked the keys at her, and then left her in the hallway without another word. She unlocked herself, then got into her bed and cried.
