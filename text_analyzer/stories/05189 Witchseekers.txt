Author�s Note

����������� These narratives were constructed
around the activities of an online community called Witchseekers, in 2004. It
was an online role play/chain story built on members� contributions, with
significant events � especially the interrogation and execution of members
�accused� of being witches � detailed in story form.

����������� My own role in the group was
initially as Torturess, then, after staging a coup and toppling the Witchseeker
General, I became the all-powerful Witchseeker General � until I too was
overthrown and arrested.

����������� Things were just getting interesting
when the group was shut down by its host.

����������� These narratives, disjointed and
notably light on any kind of plot other than their basic formula of
torture-confession-execution, are my only record of the Witchseekers story, but
I wanted to share them with the BDSM community.

����������� Please note that there is little to
no expressed sexual content in any of these works, so to many they will be more
horror fiction than erotic fiction. But there are those among us who find these
dark tales sexy indeed �

Kirsten � 19 January,
2007

����������� 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

����������� They drag Janet in; she is wearing
only a flimsy petticoat; her hands in iron fetters behind her back, a blindfold
over her eyes.� Barefoot, shrieking and
calling out, she stumbles on the stone steps as they hurry her down into the
labyrinthine dungeon.

����������� They release their grip on her arms
only once she is in the torture chamber.�
Although she can�t see anything of her surroundings, she is in terror
enough to drop at once to her knees and cower, arms behind her, at our
feet.� Her bare, slender arms are coarse
with goosebumps of cold and fear, and her nipples thrust nodes in the silk of
her negligee.� She is slender, almost
skinny, her figure small-breasted and boyish, but I note a panther-like
strength in her pale limbs.� She will not
break quickly.

����������� &quot;Remove her blindfold.&quot;

����������� Janet reacts in horror as the cloth
is taken from her eyes.� She barely
registers my presence, her huge eyes taking in the ghastly shapes that loom in
my torture chamber, shadows shifting in the guttering oily light of torches.

����������� &quot;Recoil you might, Witch,&quot;
I tell her coolly, &quot;for some of these instruments you will soon experience
for yourself.&quot;� I move to stand
beside her, and twist my fingers into the thick strawberry-blonde mane that
falls no lower than her bare shoulders.�
She struggles to free her fettered wrists as I force her scan the awful
vaulted dungeon.

&quot;There
is the rack, by which I can rend your limbs.�
There, the horse on which you may writhe.� There, a cage to squeeze your limbs, there a
table to which you may be shackled; and there, a chair of such depraved torment
you will think you have descended to Hell itself.� See the scourges, flails, irons, tongs,
pears, branks, and vices, all tools I may select for your flesh.� I will ask many questions, and in your agony,
you will gladly offer me the truth.&quot;

Janet
is shaking her head in desperate terror.�
&quot;Oh God, no, please!� I am
innocent of any wrong!� You have arrested
the wrong woman!� Please!&quot;

&quot;I
grant that you may not know yourself as Evil,&quot; I say softly, and at this,
I release her hair, kneeling beside her, clearing the strays of hair from her
face.� &quot;But Evil you are, and I will
help you see it for yourself.� Only then
will you repent: only then will we allow the Fire to cleanse you.&quot;

����������� Janet's eyes turn to fix upon my
face in bewilderment, as if she has heard more than she can bear to
absorb.� I stand.� &quot;It is late.� We begin tomorrow.� Secure her.&quot;

����������� The guards hoist Janet to her feet
and drag her across the chamber.�
&quot;No!� N-noo!&quot; she
shouts, and despite her fettered arms, she struggles to get free.� But she is taken to a space in the chamber in
which dangle black iron fetters on a long chain.� Seeing them, Janet again cries out, but she
is one woman against three men, and she has no strength to resist them.

����������� The fetters on her wrists are
released, and one of the guards draws the petticoat, the only preservation of
her modesty, over her head.

����������� &quot;No!&quot; she shrieks.� &quot;Give it back!� You cannot!&quot;� Suddenly naked, she grasps for the garment,
but the guard holds it out of reach, and her arms are quickly caught.� Her arms are lifted to the shackles on their
chains, and the hard metal is closed around her slender wrists.� It is well known that a Witch locked in iron
cannot cast a spell, and it is this that keeps me safe.

����������� Quickly, she is secured.� Two of the guards then cross to a windlass,
and turn it slowly.� The wooden axle
groans and creaks; chain clatters and clanks through a pulley overhead, and by
the fetters upon her wrists, Janet's arms are lifted.� She looks at me through the diamond-shape of
her own raised arms, fearful, vulnerable in her nakedness.

����������� The windlass turns again, her wrists
rise, and quickly her arms are pulled straight above her head.� Then the fetters bite into her hands, and her
head tips back.� I watch as her body
extends itself involuntarily.� Her arms
stretch and the hollows of her armpits deepen; her breasts rise as her ribcage
lifts; her belly hollows, her heels are raised from the stone floor, drawing
out the slender muscles of her legs.

����������� The windlass turns again.� She gives a moan as the metal on her wrists
hauls harder, so that only the ends of her toes are upon the floor.� Then another turn, and her body is raised off
the floor.� Her feet swing back, her body
taut and stretched, swaying on the end of the chain from her shackled wrists.

����������� &quot;Oh - oh!� It hurts!&quot; she finally calls, and I
believe her.� It hurts to hang by the
wrists, and even as the windlass cranks her higher, the pains shoot from her
wrists, through her shoulders. She lets her head fall forward, her mouth open
in pain and dismay, now looking at her own fanned toes, and the ten inches of
empty air below them.

����������� The guards lock the windlass.� Janet is helpless.

����������� I like to inspect my prisoners, and
I do so now, slowly.� Her slender body
hangs taut, her head forward, feet drooping and pointing towards the
floor.� The shackles have wedged against
the heel of each hand, her fingers curled with the pressure of her body's
weight.

����������� I circle to the front.� The corrugations of her ribcage are softened
by the torchlight, but the goosebumps that cover her flesh add a fascinating
texture.� Her nipples stand out, erect
stalks in the chill dungeon air.� I note
her pubic hair, a generous dark thatch, matched by the dark tufts in her
armpits.� The light catches a streak of
sweat from one underarm, running down her ribcage.

����������� I glimpse also the first tear as it
rolls down her smooth cheek.� She hangs
limp, but I know only too well the battle she fights.� For now, the only way she can manage the
strain in her shoulders and elbows is to tense the muscles of her arms.� But in an hour, perhaps two, her strength
will ebb, her muscles will burn with fatigue, and then, finally, will fail.
Then she will discover a new pain: the slow, fiery menace of ligaments and
tendons unaccustomed to taking her body's weight unassisted.

����������� By morning she will be in a
nightmare of pain.� I would love to stay
and watch, but I must leave and rest for tomorrow's work.

����������� I glance to my guards.� &quot;Burn her nightdress.� We shall return in the morning.&quot;

����������� &quot;No!� No, My Lady, I beg you!&quot; �Momentarily forgetting her pain, Janet twists
and writhes like a fish on a hook, her naked body swinging on the end of the
chain.� But it is an utterly futile
gesture, she cannot get free, and I barely give her a second glance as I lead
my guards from the chamber, and we leave her to hang, alone.

&nbsp;

����������� After breakfast, I assemble four
guards, and we make our return to the chamber.

����������� This is another favourite
moment.� When the Witch has already
tasted torment, and yet knows nothing of what is to come; when the air is
electric with possibilities and promise.

����������� Amidst the machines, the stone and
dark wood of the torture chamber, hangs the pale, naked figure of Janet,
suspended by her wrists above the floor.�
Her bare skin shines with an oiling of sweat, the only outward sign of
the agonies she has borne for nearly ten hours.

����������� �Bring her down,� I order.

����������� As her toes hit the floor, Janet�s
body folds helplessly into the arms of two guards, her manacled and
black-bruised wrists dropping loosely.�
The fetters are undone, but her arms have no strength, and she is
unresisting as the guards manacle her wrists together in front of her body, and
lift her to her feet.

����������� �Bring her.�

����������� Janet is dragged from the torture
chamber.� Though her arms are useless,
she has enough strength in her legs to stumble along a dark, slimy corridor,
then up a steep, narrow flight of steps.

����������� Doors open on a chamber perhaps
thirty feet square.� Torches and braziers
give light; directly ahead of the double oak doors is a huge table on a raised
plinth, at which are seated two figures.�
Oberon, the Witchseeker General, and his beautiful assistant, Tina.� Their faces are grim.� Books and papers lie upon the tabletop.

����������� I bow to them.� &quot;My Lord Oberon, My Lady Tina, I present
the prisoner for your inspection, Janet Halverson.&quot;

����������� It is Oberon who steps down from the
plinth, and slowly circles the quivering Janet.�
&quot;Raise her arms,&quot; he orders.�
A guard grasps the chains of Janet's wrist manacles and lifts it high,
forcing Janet's arms above her head.�
Oberon's scrutiny of her nude body is quick, but it is with practised
eye that he notes every imperfection, every blemish upon her.� &quot;Forward,&quot; he says.

����������� Pulling her arms down, the guards
instead bend her at the hips.� Janet
gives a grunt as she is doubled over, her buttocks and the hairy gully of her
sex presented.� Oberon's inspection is
intimate indeed, and I avert my eyes as he parts her lips, probes at the tight
pucker of her anus.� Finally, he returns
to the table, briefly washing his hands in a bowl of water.

����������� &quot;Janet Halvorsen, you are here
because you have been convicted of Witchcraft.&quot;

����������� Janet looks to me, and I nod, so she
turns her eyes to the Witchseeker General.�
&quot;Sir, it is not true!� I am
not a witch!&quot;

����������� &quot;Your name appeared in the Book
of Shadows, which we found in the possession of the Witch Allielle.� And you know her fate.&quot;

����������� Janet's face dips long enough for
all to see that she does know of the agony in which Allielle perished.� &quot;I am not a witch,&quot; she whispers.

����������� &quot;Save your protestations of
innocence,&quot; Tina scoffs, &quot;and for your sake, save your own flesh the
agonies of the torture chamber by telling us what we need to know.&quot;

����������� &quot;But - I don't know
what you want,&quot; Janet wails.� To Oberon she pleads, &quot;Sir, I beg you,
do not let them hurt me!&quot;

����������� &quot;Tell us about the one they
call Matmos.&quot;

����������� &quot;Matmos?&quot;� There is a flash of recognition on her face.

����������� &quot;So you know him!&quot; Tina
pounces.

����������� Janet quickly shakes her head.� &quot;No, My Lady.� I only know of him,
and of his treachery.� I know that he
preys upon young women, those for whom he lusts.� When they reject his advances, he �&quot; Her
eyes cloud with tears.� &quot;He makes up
stories about them, he has them taken away so he can do what he will with them
� and then, so they cannot speak of what happened � they end up in agony, at
the stake.&quot;� Her voice falters at
the thought that she, too, was most likely destined for that fate.

����������� &quot;Which women?&quot; Oberon
asks.

����������� &quot;I know of one,&quot; Janet
says.� &quot;The one known as Daphne.&quot;

����������� &quot;Daphne was a witch,&quot; Tina
says.� &quot;As are you.&quot;

����������� &quot;No!&quot;

����������� &quot;As is Matmos.� Do not protect him, girl.� It will only bring you harm.&quot;

����������� &quot;Why would I protect him?� He is not a witch, no more than I!&quot;

����������� &quot;LIES!&quot;� Oberon's voice is a roar that sends Janet
into a shrieking cower, and he thrusts his finger towards the door.� &quot;Take her!&quot; he bellows to me.� &quot;Take her and wrest the truth from her
bones!&quot; 

����������� The guards drag the shackled,
struggling Janet down the dark, steep stairway towards the torture chamber once
more.� &quot;Please, oh, please, I beg
you!� Please do not hurt me!� I am telling the truth!&quot;

����������� &quot;You may believe it to be the
truth now,&quot; I say calmly, following behind.� &quot;But such is the power of magic.� It is only pain that will drive away the fog
that clouds your mind, and allow you to see the truth.&quot;

����������� &quot;No-o-o-o!&quot;

����������� Her scream echoes still as we reach
the torture chamber.� &quot;The
horse,&quot; I order.

����������� Janet gapes helplessly at the
ghastly structure.� Five feet high, upon
sturdy oak legs, a sharp wedge-shaped construction, its peak uppermost like the
pitched roof of a Swiss chalet.� Deaf to
Janet's shrieks and wails for mercy, the guards prepare her.

����������� Her wrists are unfettered, only to
be secured again behind her back.� More
shackles are brought; her elbows are wrenched together and fettered so that
they almost touch.� With arms so brutally
forced together behind her back, her breasts are thrust out, like meringues
topped by ripe pink berries.� The guards
are visibly aroused.� Lingering at their
task, they fix a heavy shackle about each of her ankles, each with a large iron
ring hanging from it.

����������� &quot;She is prepared, My
Lady,&quot; I am told.

����������� I motion for them to wait.� Again, a moment to savour.

����������� Janet is held between them, her arms
painfully cinched and fastened behind her, her ribcage shifting hard as she
pants breath, her face pale with fear, her eyes fixed unfalteringly on the
terrible instrument before her.

����������� Finally, I nod.� &quot;Put her on.&quot;

����������� Like noblemen helping a lady onto
her mount, the guards guide Janet Halverson's ascent onto the horse.� She is lifted high, and hands guide one leg
over; then she is lowered upon it.� She
tries, of course, to brace her descent with her bare knees; but they can find little
friction, and the sharp wooden edge seems to pry open her thighs as she slides
down onto its unforgiving ridge.

����������� &quot;Aaaiiii!!&quot;� Janet's soft, furry sex crunches hard onto
the horse's peak.� Her face at once
screws into an expression of pain, and despite her back-bound arms, she begins
to scrabble her thighs against the smooth wood, desperate to lever herself
off.� &quot;Take me off!&quot; she
shrieks.

&quot;Weights!&quot;
I order quickly.

Even
as Janet tries to scrabble off the horse, the guards fetch two heavy iron
weights - twenty-five pounds to each - and in a matter of moments, hook them
over the rings on Janet's ankle fetters. Instantly her slender legs are drawn
and taut, the peak of the horse seems to disappear up into her lovely bush, and
her eyes bulge.

����������� &quot;Aaaaahhhhhh!&quot;� Janet gives a long cry. It is unbearable, and
she pitches forward - but it is only for a moment, as her labia and clitoris
are crunched onto the sharp edge of the horse, causing even worse pain that
snatches her breath away.� In a gyration
of torment, she fights to tilt her pelvis back again, desperate to find relief
from the pain.

Her
eyes find me even as the sweat begins to bead upon her face and breasts.� &quot;Please!�
Take me off!� Take me off!&quot;

&quot;Give
your confession.� Give us the names.� Give us the truth.&quot;

Janet
bursts into tears.� &quot;I cannot!� Oh, My Lady, I cannot!&quot; she
shrieks.� &quot;Aaaahh!!&quot;� Her head tips back and she bellows in pain
and misery to the vaulted ceiling.�
&quot;Oh God, it hurts!&quot;

����������� The tears spill freely; she is
paralysed by pain but in too much agony to remain still.� As her head rocks forward again, she sees
that I have led the four guards halfway to the door, and horror joins the
anguish on her face.

����������� &quot;No-o-o!� Don't leave me!!&quot;

����������� The door slams shut on her cries. 

&nbsp;

����������� There are countless tortures at the
disposal of an inquisitor.� Some are fast
and brutal - brands, whips, amputation, burning.� True, they have shock value and have their
place, but they are not my preference.� I
go for the slow, the subtle; the tortures that build over time to an all-consuming
intensity.

I
give Janet three hours to suffer the horror of the horse before returning to
the torture chamber, this time with a scribe to record every word spoken, and
Austin, appointed chief assistant.

Janet
is, as I expected, in agony.� Her body is
wet, shining from head to toe with sweat. Her arms, manacled behind her back,
are racked with cramps; her hip joints are tortured by the stretching effect of
the weights.� But it is nothing at all
compared to the pain between her legs.

For
three hours, her bodyweight plus the fifty pounds of the ankle-weights has been
forcing her labia and perineum down onto an unforgiving wooden edge.� No matter how she shifts, no matter how she
writhes, nothing will ease the pain.�
Indeed, the agony has grown and spread like slow fire, seemingly through
her very bones, to fill her hips and womb and abdomen; to creep up her spine.

She
is panting hard in agony as I draw near, and her face, pale with suffering,
lifts slowly.� There are dark rings under
her eyes.� The sweat is dripping from her
brow; it streaks her ribcage and her thighs. 

&quot;Confess,&quot;
I tell her.

Her
head nods in misery.� &quot;Tell me what
I must say, and I will say it!&quot;

&quot;Say
you are a witch.&quot;

New
tears fill her eyes.� &quot;If I confess
that, I will be burned alive.&quot;

&quot;That's
true.&quot;� I look to Austin.� &quot;More weights.&quot;

&quot;Oh
no!� No!�
NO!&quot;� New life floods Janet
as adrenalin surges.� She sees the guards
collect the heavy iron ingots, sees evidence of their weight in the men's
grunts and heaves.�� She is looking at me
and begging, almost gibbering like a madwoman in her fear as they hook another
twenty-five pounds to each of her ankles and, on Austin�s signal, let them
swing.

Her
scream is terrible.� Her exhausted legs
are stretched by fifty pounds at each ankle; between her thighs, the horse
bears all of that weight along a single, sharp ridge, and suddenly it must feel
as if she has been cleaved in two. The dark triangle of her pubic bush seems to
be split by the horse�s cruel peak.

&quot;Confess!&quot;
I shout.� &quot;Confess, and it will
end!&quot;

&quot;No,
no, no, no no!&quot; Janet shrieks.

A
quick motion of my hand, and Austin leads his guards from the chamber.� I follow them, chased by Janet's wordless
cries of pain.

����������� The door booms shut

����������� The fourth hour of torture upon the
horse is a hundred times worse for Janet than the previous three.� Every minute feels like a hundred.� The pain is comparable to laying a red-hot
iron between her legs, but wonderfully, one that endures far longer.

����������� When we return, Janet is twisting
and pitching in constant agony, crying and shrieking at the ceiling, riding the
horse so beautifully that one of Austin�s guards momentarily forgets himself, a
hand wandering to his groin.� I decide to
let it pass; I have more important matters to address.

����������� Even as I am half-way towards her,
Janet begins her desperate pleading.�
&quot;Stop the pain, take me down!�
Please, take me down! Oh, God, it hurts!&quot;

����������� &quot;Witch!� Do you see the truth now?&quot; I call.

����������� &quot;Please, mercy, please!&quot;
Janet cries in desperation.

����������� &quot;Tell me about Matmos,&quot; I
demand.

����������� &quot;Please -&quot;

����������� &quot;Tell me!&quot;

����������� Janet gives a cry, pain and defeat,
and finally concedes.� &quot;He's a
witch!� I confess it!� Ohh, the pain!� Please - take me down!� Matmos is a
witch, torture him instead!&quot;

����������� &quot;Believe me, I will,&quot; I
promise.� &quot;What is his standing amongst
the witches?� What do you know of his
activities, of his whereabouts?� How did
you come to know him?&quot;

����������� &quot;Oh, have mercy, I cannot
say!� I cannot!� Please, take me down!&quot;

����������� &quot;Talk,
witch!� What of
Matmos?� And who else have you
seen?&quot;

����������� &quot;I don't remember!&quot;

����������� &quot;Look at where you are,
Janet,&quot; I shout at her.� &quot;Do
you think it will end, for you?�
Remembering is the only thing that will save you!&quot;

����������� Janet's response is a long wail of
pain, and her head droops for a moment.�
Gleaming, naked, arms twisted behind her and legs stretched so that
every muscle is defined and taut, she straddles the horse's cruel ridge.� Sweat streaks her ribcage, drips from her
face; her hair clings to her neck and shoulders.� The apex of the horse seems to have forced
its way right up into her dark pubic bush, bisecting her most tender part.� Those sweet, shining meringue breasts heave
in her agony. 

����������� &quot;More weights,&quot; I say to
Austin.

����������� &quot;No-o-o �&quot;� It is more a wail than a scream, sick with
dread.� &quot;No more!&quot;

����������� &quot;What of Matmos?� And who are the others?&quot;

����������� &quot;I don't know!&quot;

����������� &quot;Do you know of a witch called
Kathy?&quot;

����������� &quot;Yes!� Oh, please, question her,
she will tell you more than I!&quot;

����������� &quot;And what of Matmos?� The truth, Witch!&quot;

����������� &quot;No,&quot; she weeps.� &quot;Please.&quot;

����������� &quot;Add the weights,&quot; I say.

����������� The mere threat was not enough.� Now, as Janet's cries escalate into a frenzy
of panic, Austin has his guards hook another weight to each ankle.� Seventy-five pounds hanging off each ankle,
her hips are stretched as if on the rack, near the point of dislocation, agony
spearing the joints, tearing like fire along the very bones of her legs.� But even worse is the wooden edge grinding up
into her cunt.

����������� Janet screams like one touched by
the flames.

����������� &quot;Matmos is the leader!� He is the one in Black!� Oh, I beg you, take me off!� Take me off!&quot;� Her confession dissolves into a long scream.

����������� &quot;What is your association with
him?&quot;

����������� &quot;He seduced me, oh please, he
seduced me and had his way with me!�
Allielle, too, I was her concubine, but I swear I am not a witch!� Please, stop the pain!� Stop it!&quot;

����������� &quot;It will stop when you have
answered my questions,&quot; I say, and Janet screams on in desperate
agony.� &quot;Tell me about Matmos!&quot;

����������� &quot;I don't know!&quot; Janet
shrieks, over and over.� &quot;I gave him
favours, but when I learned of his treachery, I hid!� Oh ... oh God ...&quot;

����������� &quot;Speak of his treachery.&quot;

����������� &quot;Evil,&quot; Janet gasps.� She is overwhelmed by the pain, now, and I
know that she will soon become insensible to questioning.� &quot;Likes ... to see .... the witches ...&quot;

����������� &quot;Fetch water,&quot; I order.

����������� Austin draws a pail of icy water
from a well in a dark recess of the dungeon, and flings it over Janet's sagging
form.� The shock brings a shriek and then
a long wail of agony from her.� Her hips
are audibly grinding from their sockets, her body giving up its struggle to
endure.

����������� &quot;Tell me about Matmos,&quot; I
insist.

����������� Janet's voice is little more than a
whisper.� &quot;He betrays those who will
not give themselves to him ... casts a spell so that they will not offer his
name, even under torture ... then he acts as witchseeker and torturer himself
... to see them suffer ... to see them burn at the stake ...&quot;

����������� &quot;And you?&quot; I ask.� &quot;Are you one of his betrayals?&quot;

����������� Her eyes, barely able to focus, find
mine.� &quot;I am not a witch.&quot;

����������� For now, it is enough.� The scribe, behind me, writes furiously.� There will be more: Janet will see the truth,
but this is not the session.� I finally
nod to Austin.� &quot;Bring her
down.� Give her water and secure her
until I am ready to resume her interrogation.�

�

����������� Janet is chained to a stone column
in the torture chamber, sitting naked on the cold floor, her wrists manacled to
an iron ring above her head.� The way her
hands droop from the fetters tell more than anything else; she has acquiesced,
she has been broken, and she will condemn even herself when the torture
resumes.

����������� I give her a day to recover from the
horse.� Despite her agonies, no lasting
damage was done, and she is quickly ready for the interrogation to continue.

����������� &quot;Prepare her for the
pear,&quot; I say.

����������� There are numerous ways a witch might
be presented for this torture.� I have
ordered that she be secured at one end of the torture-table, standing with her
legs spread, on tiptoe, ankles tied widely apart to the table-legs.� Then, with wrists manacled behind her back,
she is forced to bend forward at the waist, so that her breasts and belly kiss
the table-top, her naked haunches and hairy cleft bared to the room.� A single rope, fastened loosely but securely
about her neck and tied to adjacent iron rings in the table, prevents her from
rising, or indeed from moving with any freedom within her bondage.

����������� She looks as if she is presenting
herself to be fucked from behind.� The
guards all look strained by the lust they feel at seeing her young, fertile
body so exposed.� Clearly visible in her
spreadeagled position, her labia are still swollen from her torture upon the
horse, resembling arousal. The tight brown star of her anus is clear to see.

����������� I let her remain like that for
almost an hour.� She knows that torture
is inevitable, and her sobs and moans of dread echo off the unfeeling stone
walls.� She cannot see behind her,
though, and when the torture chamber door opens and I walk in, accompanied by
Austin and his two guards, my mentor Tina, and the scribe, she flinches at the
sound.

����������� Tina is, as always, calm; but by the
flickering of torches on the walls, I notice a slight flushing to her face,
tiny sparks of sweat along her hairline.�
Only moments ago, she admitted that she has never witnessed the use of
the pear, as other methods have always proven effective.� Nevertheless, she has agreed to provide
guidance during the interrogation.

����������� By the nature of her restraint, the
witch Janet is forced to look along the tabletop, towards the two objects that
will so utterly consume the next hours of her wretched life.

����������� One is an hourglass, one foot tall,
in a crafted mahogany frame.� It is
filled with the finest white sand.� The
second object is of brass, and in shape resembles an enlarged version of the
fruit whose name it bears: the pear.� It
is beautifully ornate, filigree-carved.�
From its narrowest end, a long turnscrew protrudes.

����������� I move into Janet�s view, and her
eyes wildly seek out my face.� Terror
fills her expression; the tears have washed clean trails down her grubby
cheeks.� She makes no sound as I pick up
the pear, holding it so that she can see it well, and slowly, gently, I turn
the handle.

����������� Like a flower blooming, the four
segments of the pear gently part and spread; gleaming brass petals that open
out until easily ten inches across.� From
behind Janet, Tina cannot suppress a gasp.�
I can see in her eyes that she is shocked by the reality of the pear,
and of the damage it could wreak.

����������� She composes herself, and strides
slowly to stand alongside me.� She bends
down, fixes eyes full of compassion and sorrow to Janet.� &quot;Sweet girl, please tell us what you
know.� Otherwise, this will truly
hurt.� I don't want that to happen, any
more than you.&quot;

����������� &quot;I can vouch that it
hurts,&quot; I say.� I turn the pear
slowly in my hands, inspecting its gleaming open blades.� &quot;Imagine this inside you. Scraping.
Tearing. Filling you with unbelievable agony. And when I start to move it
around � I may need both hands, and all of my strength - but oh, it will be
terrible. You will hear it,
as your insides are shredded to a juicy pulp.�
Just think of your body convulsing, writhing � and yet, there is not a
thing you will be able to do, but scream, and beg me to stop.&quot;

����������� Janet begins to cry.� &quot;No,&quot; she pleads.

����������� &quot;I cannot tell you what to
say,&quot; Tina says to her.� &quot;As
there is no way I can fathom the treacherous depths of your soul.� Tell me everything.&quot;

����������� Janet's composure, shaken from the
start, crumbles.� &quot;I don't know what
you want to hear!&quot; she shrieks, and throws herself into a desperate
struggle to get free.� Her wrists jerk on
the shackles, her ankles on the ropes that hold her legs spread; she fights to
pull her head from the loop of rope about her neck.� But Austin has tied the knots himself, and
Janet has no chance of escape.

����������� Tina has her hands on her hips.� &quot;I see she still needs persuasion.� Please proceed, Kirsten.� We must wrest the truth from her.&quot;

����������� &quot;As you wish,&quot; I say.� I screw the pear back to its normal
position.� All the while, Janet tries her
best to, quite literally, save her arse.

&quot;Please,&quot;
she begs through her tears, &quot;don't do this.� Please, don't hurt me.� What you hear will not be the truth, merely
the words you want me to speak!&quot; 

����������� &quot;The truth will be torn from
you, whether you believe it true or not,&quot; I insist.� Twisting within her bonds, Janet tries to see
what I am doing behind her, as Austin holds out a pail of lard.� I collect a heavy wad with my fingers.

����������� The spread of Janet's slender legs
presents the gentle valley between her buttocks nicely, the star of her
arsehole, and below it, the dark hairy secret of her pussy.� Firmly, I smear the pat of lard directly over
her anus.

����������� &quot;No-oo!!&quot;� Janet shrieks, and bucks again against her
restraints.� &quot;Please, please, if you
have any mercy at all ...!&quot;

����������� &quot;It's because
we have mercy that we give you this chance to discover your
faults, and gain some redemption before you burn,&quot; I tell her.

����������� I run my fingers over the cool
filigree of the pear�s closed metal bulb.�
The tip, where the four petals meet, is shaped like a nipple.� It is this which I place first against
Janet's anus, and she jolts at the cold touch in such a sensitive spot.

����������� &quot;Don't,&quot; she pleads.

����������� &quot;Confess that you are a witch,
and I can stop it now,&quot; Tina urges, her eyes promising kindness.

����������� &quot;Please, I beg you,&quot; is
all Janet can say, so I push the pear in.

����������� It is a simple technique; holding
the pear at base and handle, leaning my whole body into the task and aided by
the lard, I force it in.� Her sphincter
spreads to allow the full diameter of the pear, and it draws a long groan from
her throat.� Its entry is painful, and
her bowels automatically spasm and resist in an urge to eject the
intruder.� But she can do nothing. As the
pear is pushed into her rectum, she begins to shriek in pain. I drive it ever
deeper into her bowels, her anus clenching and distending around the broad
metal barrel, until finally it is buried all the way inside her, her sphincter
tight around the pear�s neck. Little more than the handle now protrudes.

����������� &quot;It hurts, it hurts!&quot;
Janet shrieks.

����������� &quot;Reminds you of the demon cock,
does it, Witch?&quot; one of the guards calls, and his colleague breaks into
nervous laughter.

����������� I see the tiny sparks of sweat
appear on the downy skin between Janet's shoulder blades; the muscles in her
arms shift as she struggles to break free.�
The unbearable pressure in her arse makes her gasp and heave in her
throes of discomfort.� Firmly, I give the
screw a twist; deep inside Janet, the four segments of the pear separate a
fraction, minutely distending the walls of her rectum.

����������� It is only a hint of what will come,
but already it is equal to the worst bowel pain she has ever felt; invasive,
intrusive.� Her eyes are wide in shock
and disbelief, her mouth open.� I twist
the handle again, and this time Janet gives a scream.

����������� &quot;Oh God!!!� Aahhh!!&quot; �The agony easily doubles with just the tiniest
change in the pear's spread, sweeping up through her bowels and driving a
curtain of sweat over her entire body.�
It is intense, engulfing, far more debilitating than the horse; she is
paralysed by it, capable of nothing but screaming.

����������� So I give the screw a full turn.

����������� This time, Janet screams as loudly
as she can scream, her voice echoing off the walls, reverberating through the
torture chamber.� This is pain beyond
imagination, and she is so overwhelmed by it, she is incapable of rational
thought.

����������� I open the pear wider still, and
Janet's shrieks become painful to the ears.�
Already there is a subtle shift to the angle of her spine, the device
pressing on her lower vertebrae.� She is
calling out to God, to Jesus, sheer blasphemy from the mouth of a witch; the
words ride on flecks of spittle, her eyes and the veins on her neck bulging
with the immense agony of the torture.

����������� I slowly circle the table.� Every muscle in Janet's young body is rigid
with suffering as she screams.� I grasp
her hair, wrench her head up off the table, sending more shock waves of pain
through her body.

����������� &quot;I will give you half an hour
before we resume,&quot; I tell her.�
&quot;Pray the truth reveals itself before the sand in this hourglass
runs through.&quot;� Before her
pain-glazed eyes, I turn the hourglass over, and the slow trickle begins.� I look to my companions.� &quot;My Lady Tina; Austin; we will leave,
for now.&quot;

����������� For half an hour, Janet
suffers.� Her screams become hoarse and
slowly ebb: after a time, there are only wails and shrieks coming from the
tortured witch.� Even from another room,
we can hear the echoes of her misery. The conversation is of procedures, the
ethics of the witch hunt; but I am distracted, somehow excited by the prospect
of returning to my work.

����������� Finally, it is time to return.� We walk into the torture chamber as the last
of the sand runs through the hourglass.�
From a table laid out with implements, I gather a thick cane as we pass.

����������� Janet is whimpering in agony.� Her body is shining wet.� On the floor below her, a puddle of urine,
forced from her bladder by the pressure of the pear.� Down the inside of one taut thigh, a thin
line of blood runs from her anus.� On
hearing our approach, she begins wailing in new distress.

����������� &quot;Please,&quot; she begs,
&quot;please take it out, take it out!�
I'll talk, oh for the love of God, I'll tell you anything, just take it
out!&quot;

����������� &quot;Say you are a witch.� Confess it,&quot; Tina tells her.� &quot;Please tell all you know, or there is
greater pain to come!&quot;

����������� Even in her agony, Janet hesitates,
and it is my cue.� Raising the cane high
above my head, I swing it down with all of my force on the small of her
back.� It smashes with a CRACK!!
across her flesh, a shock wave through her body and
distended innards, and she gives a screech of pain, followed by utter silence,
the very breath driven from her lungs by agony.

����������� Finally, her head nods feverishly,
and when she finally catches breath, she gasps, &quot;I confess it!� Oh, I confess it!� I am a witch!�
Please, no more, hurt me no more!&quot; 

����������� &quot;You confirm that you are a
witch?&quot;

����������� &quot;Yes!&quot;

����������� &quot;You can provide details?&quot;

����������� &quot;Yes!� Yes!&quot;

����������� &quot;And what of Matmos?� And Kathy?&quot;

����������� &quot;Please, I have told you all I
know!&quot;

����������� &quot;I don't think you have,&quot;
Tina responds, and she glances at me.

����������� Janet begins screaming anew even as
I brace one hand on her sweat-slick lower back and grasp the turnscrew of the
pear.� I twist the screw, and Janet's
voice pitches upwards in a roar of agony.�
Odd creaking and popping sounds, muffled and deep, sound from her bowels
as the cruel petals blossom outwards.

����������� Janet�s screams are animal, barely
human, shriek after shriek.� The bulge of
the pear is discernible in the otherwise-sleek line of her body.� With my hand still on the turnscrew, I push
and pull, shifting and rocking the expanded device inside her, and her fingers
spread in maddened pain at every excruciating movement.

����������� Finally, another half-turn of the
screw, and Janet's hoarse screams continue.

����������� I turn the hourglass.� &quot;We will leave her like this.� She will talk soon.&quot;

����������� When we return, the only sound is
Janet's ragged gasps for air.� Her body,
wet, is steaming in the chill torture chamber.�
Her back shifts in spasms with each breath.� Her legs remain stretched and bound to the
feet of the table, her wrists manacled at her back; the handle of the pear
protrudes grotesquely from her anus.� A
fresh trickle of blood streaks the inside of her thigh.

����������� Her face shows of a battle for her
very sanity, against unending agony; it is an expression that brands itself
upon me. Her brow is furrowed, her eyes barely focused, her mouth open, a rope
of saliva hanging to the table beneath her chin.� Tina gently takes out her handkerchief and
dabs at Janet's trembling lips.

����������� &quot;Janet, dear, it is time for
you to tell us all.&quot;

����������� I move behind her, to where the
handle of the pear extends from her clenched arsehole, and gently put my hand
upon the small of her back.� Even that
small pressure makes her convulse and groan in agony.

����������� &quot;Well?&quot;

����������� &quot;Ask anything, and I will
tell,&quot; Janet manages to say, her voice shaking.

����������� &quot;What of Matmos?� How have you observed him to be a
witch?&quot;

����������� &quot;He bewitches women,&quot;
Janet says.� &quot;He fills them with
lust and corrupts them, so that they abandon their husbands and their clothes,
and offer themselves to him.� Those witches
who refuse ... he betrays.&quot;

����������� The scribe writes. Tina listens. I
hover my hand over the handle of the pear.

����������� &quot;Go on,&quot; Tina urges.

����������� &quot;He speaks of �Little Matmos,�
but his cock is anything but
little.� That is the secret to his
power.� With it, he has seduced women and
witches, sorceresses and succubae.&quot;

����������� Tina and I exchange a glance.

����������� &quot;What of Kathy Linyd?&quot;

����������� &quot;Like me, she fell for Matmos'
charm.&quot;

����������� Tina mops the clustered droplets of
sweat from Janet's suffering face.�
&quot;One more question, dear,&quot; she says.� &quot;Where are they?&quot;

����������� &quot;I don't know,&quot; Janet
says.

����������� My hand closes on the pear's handle,
and I twist.� Within her, the device
blossoms, and the scream explodes hoarsely from her throat, long and agonised,
her body jolting with the severity of it.�
When her screams subside, she pants, &quot;a ranch, it is a ranch, I can
show you on a map!&quot;

����������� I look to Tina, who examines Janet's
face, then nods at me.

����������� Finally, I begin screwing the pear
closed again.� Our work with Janet is
done.

&nbsp;

����������� One week after her confession, it is
time for Janet to burn.

&quot;No-o-o!
No-o-o-o!!&quot;

Janet's
terrified screeching climbs above the jeers of the crowd as the executioners
pull her hands behind the stout wooden stake. She struggles, but torture and
imprisonment have weakened her, and she is easily restrained.

The
manacles that join her wrists behind the stake are enough to hold her in place;
the stake's diameter is such that her back-twisted arms only just encircle it,
her shoulder blades tightly against the wood, her buttocks pressed to it.

����������� &quot;I don't want to
di-i-i-ie!&quot; she hollers out.

����������� With Janet secured, the executioners
pick their way off to the side. The wood-pile is small, barely two feet high.
The fire will not grow quickly, and the flames may not reach any higher than
Janet's heaving breasts, but it will be enough.

Oberon,
the Witchseeker General, calmly begins to list the charges, and the noise of
the crowd fades. Each charge is followed by the words; &quot;and to this, she
has confessed.&quot;� Only the ongoing
cries of Janet, oblivious to all but her own terror, compete with Oberon's
authoritative tone.

����������� All eyes are upon the young woman.
She is attractive, even in this dishevelled state; her figure slender and
petite, her breasts small and high upon her ribcage. Her hips are narrow, her
legs are long and lean. Between her thighs, the dark triangle of her pubic hair
is dainty despite her time in the dungeon.

����������� Finally, Oberon speaks the words all
have come to hear: &quot;for this, the Witch, Janet Halverson, is sentenced to
burn.&quot; There is a huge cheer from the crowd, drowning Janet's frantic
pleas for mercy, for bargain, for reconsideration.

����������� From the brazier that smokes
alongside the woodpile, Oberon draws a fluttering torch. The naked Janet tries
to shrink back even from that small fire, her eyes wild, hair half-veiling her
face, her bare breasts shining with perspiration. &quot;No! No! Put it out, oh,
put it out!&quot; she shrieks.

����������� Almost with tenderness, Oberon lays
the torch in the outermost scatterings of straw, well beyond Janet's feet. The
crowd falls silent. Even Janet lowers her voice to a whimper, as all eyes watch
the birth of the witch's fire.

����������� Flames jump, sputter in the tinder
around the torch. A twist of blue-grey smoke. A crackling twig. Then, the
flames begin to take, spreading, jumping, creeping towards their prey. Janet's
panic reawakens at the sight of it, and she begins to buck against the
restraint of her own arms: if she could tear them from their sockets simply to
escape, she would.

����������� The crowd begins to jeer and shout
again, as if encouraging the fire. It seems to respond, spreading rapidly
beneath the tinder: there are loud pops and crackles as wood catches alight, as
the flames leap up through the gaps. They are only four feet away from Janet's
bare legs, and she can already feel their warmth.

����������� &quot;No, no, no, no!&quot; she is
shrieking, and suddenly, with her bare feet, she is trying to kick away the
bundles of wood. I glance at Steve and Austin, the executioners, but Austin
signals me to leave it. If she succeeds in kicking away the fire's fuel, Janet
will merely prolong her own agony.

����������� Despite Janet's efforts, the fire
grows, building quickly to her left. A slight breeze catches a swirl of smoke,
guides it up around her face, and she turns her head away, coughing, her plan
to kick away the wood forgotten. A moment later, a twig pops and tiny embers
ride up on the hot air current, several of them touching Janet's naked flesh.
She shrieks and flinches from their searing touch.

����������� Her body is shining. Sweat drawn
from fear, drawn from heat, as the air around her begins to shimmer. Her
ribcage heaves in frightened breath. She is all but exhausted, having fought
with all of her limited strength to break free. Now, all that remains are her
pathetic efforts to avoid the fire by pushing herself back against the post,
rising up on tiptoes and turning her face away.

����������� Still the fire spreads. The flames
grow and leap and catch, crackling and hissing, now less than two feet away
from her. Carried on the quick-rising air, several tongues of fire flick out
around her knees, searing her skin, and she screams in pain, kicking and
stamping her feet. There is a wild cheer from the crowd.

����������� I can feel the heat of the fire on
my face, now, and I shuffle back. For a few moments I can imagine her abject
terror. Seeing the flames rise like hungry beasts, unstoppable. I imagine that
heat on my bare breasts, on my belly, on my thighs. I am mesmerised by Janet's
fear.

����������� She is squirming, unable to stay
still, unable to get free. Her feet stamp and paw endlessly at the wood that
surrounds her, frantic attempts to somehow stave off the advancing flames.
There is less smoke, now, as the fire burns hotter and cleaner, rising air
stirring her strawberry-blonde hair, like a breath of summer wind. Sweat drips
from her face, clusters in droplets on her bare breasts.

����������� Another gust of wind, and fire jumps
at her. A flurry of flames lick at her left thigh, there is a quick puff of
smoke and steam, and Janet gives a shout of pain. She sags slightly as the
flames briefly subside; but just as quickly, they pick up again. The fire darts
up through the twigs and sticks, and as it begins to lick and hiss about her
feet, Janet turns her face to the sky and screams.

The
fire rallies and surges, faster, more furious, crackling and popping beneath
the sounds of Janet's shrieks. Her shining calves show reddened welts from the
scorching touch of fire, and though she tries to pull away, she is trapped and
helpless to it. Flame, bright and orange, wraps around her leg, flutters up one
thigh, fuelled by the downy peach-fuzz. Quick wisps of black and oily smoke
spin up into the air as skin blisters and creeps back from the fire's touch,
and Janet shakes her head in maddened agony.

����������� Suddenly, I can smell her burning.
The sweet smell of roasting flesh, the odour of singed hair. Pain has suddenly
given her strength, and she is tugging and tearing at her manacles again,
trying dementedly to pull free of the fire, but she is held in place.

����������� Savage, hot flames slither up the
stake below her, flickering up between her thighs like the fiery tongues of
demons, and her beautiful pubic bush flares and is gone. Her buttocks are
briefly embraced by fire; her flesh reddens and steams, and Janet twists and
bellows in her agony.

����������� She is still stamping her feet, and
the movement drives up drifts of sparks that scorch her skin and twist into the
air like fireflies.

����������� The fire grows. Hotter, faster; now
it begins to roar in its anger, a deep rumble beneath the shrill screams of the
burning witch. I can see that her feet and lower legs are alight, the oils of
her skin burning like a candle. Her arms and ribcage and breasts are reddening
from the heat, although the flames still jump no higher than her waist.

����������� A fluttering burst of flame sputters
up between her thighs again, and licks her scorched pussy. Janet howls and
jerks in the fetters. The fire is hungry, a savage, cruel lover, tearing her
most tender parts like red-hot iron files. Her genitals are suddenly sizzling
and steaming, smoke funnelling up from between her thighs, flames intimately
licking into the cleft of her buttocks, burning her loins. She flings her head
about, her screams manic, shrill, demented, her struggles crazed. Her feet and
lower legs are truly on fire, now; it has reached the point where, even if the
flames were doused, she would not survive. I can hear a new sound, the hissing
and crackling of her burning flesh, the popping of bones in her feet as they
burst in the heat.

It
is a gruesome and terrible way to die, but it is the way a witch must perish.

����������� Janet twists and screeches
endlessly; the fire is too small to finish her quickly. 

Slow
minutes pass. The fire consumes her lower body, ravaging flesh, until her legs
have no life, and she is held in place only by her back-twisted arms about the
stake. The shimmering heat half-disguises the awful ravages being wrought upon
her face and body, but I catch glimpses of her hair turning to char, her flesh
roasting, her naked breasts splitting and cracking. Her body itself has become
a torch, her flesh becoming tallow and burning in slow, oily flames.

����������� Some in the crowd have seen enough,
and leave, knowing that the witch is all but dead; with her beauty destroyed by
fire, there is little to witness but her final throes and struggles. Although
she still wails aloud, she seems dazed, bewildered. It is now, some say, that a
dying witch finally speaks the truth; fire has torn away all the baggage of
life, experience, and the weight of consequence, leaving only the naked soul of
the newborn. But Janet has no words, only moans. She knows she has lost the
battle to live, and now she can only wait for death.

����������� But death is a long time coming.
Even as the drifts of smoke from her burning body turn dark, and the hissing
turns to a crackling, roasting sizzle, the Witch still moves about, her head
lolling from one side to the other, her shoulders pitching about.

She
dies slowly, so slowly.

An
hour after the fire was lit, Janet Halverson's head sinks slowly forward. She
does not move after that, and the fire enfolds her entire body, the flames
turning bright, the smoke rolling skyward heavy and grey.

����������� The Witchseekers' work is done, and
the witch known as Janet Halverson is dead.

Part 2 � Kathy Linyd

&nbsp;

����������� Kathy
Linyd's hands are shaking violently as the iron fetters are locked about her
wrists.� She knows enough of the
Witchseekers' finesse to be afraid; but she has seen the result of confessing,
the shrieks and throes of a witch dying in fire, and she does not want to share
their awful fate.

����������� &quot;Raise
her,&quot; I command.

����������� It
is simple preparation.� The heavy
windlass turns and Kathy's arms are raised above her head by the retracting
chain.� Her hands droop useless from the
iron shackles.� I have not yet ordered
her stripped; for now, she still stands vulnerable in the flimsy floral
sundress she was wearing when arrested - grubby, now, from her cell.� She wears slip-on pumps on her feet.

����������� Another
crank of the windlass, and her arms are pulled straight over her head, her wrist-shackles
knocking together.� She is raised on
tip-toes, struggling to keep her weight on her feet, fighting the growing pain
in her wrists.

����������� I
move close to her.� &quot;How does it
feel to be helpless, Kathy?&quot; I ask softly.�
&quot;How does it feel to be chained in a dungeon?� I bet you fantasised about this as a little
girl � I bet you dreamed of being the helpless damsel in distress.� How does it really feel?&quot;

����������� &quot;I
am not afraid,&quot; Kathy quavers.

����������� I
trail the tip of one finger down the underside of her arm, skin like soft
satin, through the exposed hollow of her armpit.� The gathering sweat betrays her lie.� I stare into her eyes, but direct my voice to
Austin, at the winch.�
&quot;Higher,&quot; I say.

����������� The
winch turns, the chain pulls, and I see the subtle flicker of panic in Kathy's
eyes as she feels the tug on her wrists; her weight is wrenched onto the iron
fetters, the strain travels down through her arms, and for an instant only the
pointed toes of her pumps touch the floor.�
Then, the chain has wound her higher, and her feet are swinging free,
not quite kissing their own shadow on the flagstones.� She gives a grunt and a moan as the pain
flares in her wrists.� The muscles in her
arms tighten as she flexes against the strain.

����������� Her
shadow edges further across the floor as she is hoisted higher; now, she casts
her head back in growing angst, looking up the taut landscape of her own bare
arms to the shackles that bite her wrists, and to the five feet of iron chain
that travels up to a ring in the vaulted ceiling.� The windlass continues to turn, more links
clatter through the ring, and Kathy moans again as, by the wrists, she is
lifted higher still.

����������� Finally,
when her toes are a foot-and-a-half off the floor, I motion Austin to
stop.� &quot;Secure her like that.&quot;

����������� Kathy's
head rocks forward, her face flushed with the pain of her suspension.� She shifts her feet, and one shoe drops,
landing on the floor below her.� Bare
toes twitch in the cool dungeon air.� The
flip-skirt of her sundress shifts about her thighs as she briefly pedals her
legs, trying to evade the discomfort.�
&quot;Please,&quot; she gasps, &quot;let me down?&quot;

����������� I
smile.� &quot;Good night, Kathy
Linyd.� We will see you tomorrow.&quot;

����������� &quot;What?&quot;� It is a familiar reaction; as we walk from
the chamber, her voice echoes in panic.�
&quot;No!� Please, don't leave me
like this!� Don't leave me!&quot;

����������� We
leave her.� 

&nbsp;

����������� One
thing I like about the reality of a torture chamber: the victim doesn't escape.

����������� If
this was Hollywood, Kathy would have miraculously freed herself and taken to
the hills during the night.� As it is,
Matmos, briefly captured after Janet�s interrogation, has been freed, the witch
Daffy taunts from some secret location: but when we return to the torture
chamber in the morning, Kathy Linyd hangs exactly as we had left her.� And after eight hours suspended by her
wrists, she is exhausted to the core.

����������� Heavily,
limply, she hangs from the shackles, her head forward, copper-coloured hair
forward over her pale face.� Her arms and
legs shine with an oiling of sweat.� Even
her dress seems to heavily drape her slender figure, drawn downwards by the
inexorable torture of gravity.� Her hands
are like claws above the fetters.� One
foot bare, the other still shod, toes down-pointed.

����������� &quot;Bring
her down,&quot; I order.

����������� After
a night of no sleep, no rest, battling the strain of hanging by her wrists
until drained of every last ounce of strength, Kathy is in no position to fight
as she is cranked to the floor.� She
manages to stand, her feet apart, but her manacled wrists drop with the chain,
and she almost topples over, until caught by a guard.� &quot;Remove her fetters.&quot;

����������� It
is all about timing.� We work quickly, so
that she will not have the chance to think, nor react; the irons are taken from
her wrists, revealing the purple-black of bruising.� I give the order to strip her; the delicate
shoestring straps of her sundress are slipped from her shoulders, and the
garment drops away, baring her full and firm breasts.� A moment later, Austin deftly tugs off her
panties, revealing the auburn thatch of her pubic hair.� Still dazed and weak from her ordeal hanging
by the wrists, Kathy makes no move to preserve her modesty.� Her eyes, heavy with weariness, remain fixed
to the floor.

����������� Austin
and his assistant guard take hold of Kathy's arms and hold her steady, as I
draw close to her.� &quot;Save yourself,
Kathy,&quot; I urge her.� &quot;Confess
that you are a witch.� Tell us where we
will find Daffy, and Matmos.� Tell us how
we will trace them and capture them.&quot;

����������� Slowly,
Kathy lifts her face to regard me.� She
blinks slowly, moves her lips.� &quot;I
do not know these things,&quot; she says, &quot;and I am not a witch.&quot;

����������� I
stand aside to give her a view of the torture chamber, and indicate the many
hideous instruments laid out.� &quot;Look
at the tools of my trade, Kathy.� I can
crack your fingers and break your toes, I can shred and scourge and brand and
roast your flesh, I can crush, tear, and distend the most sensitive parts of
you.� Eventually, pain will drive from
your lips the answers to everything I ask.�
Save yourself this anguish and talk to me now.&quot;

����������� &quot;I
know nothing,&quot; Kathy repeats.

����������� &quot;Very
well.&quot;� To my guards: &quot;Put her
on the rack.&quot;

����������� Deserved
or not, no instrument of torture has quite the reputation of the rack.� It is the most famous, the most feared, the
most exciting.� Ours is a masterpiece -
nine feet long, with a heavy roller at either end, made of heavy oak.� The ratcheting mechanisms are such that every
turn incurs a stretch of barely one-fifth of an inch.

����������� As
the guards wrest her across the torture chamber, the adrenaline of fear returns
a semblance of life to Kathy's limbs.�
She struggles, albeit weakly, but succeeds only in losing her other
shoe, the last vestige of clothing.� Now,
as naked as the newborn, she is vulnerable in the guards' hands as they bodily
lift her onto the huge wooden bed.

����������� She
is laid on her back, squealing and protesting desperately.� &quot;No!�
Please!� You can't do this to
me!� I have done nothing!&quot;

����������� My
rack is fitted with chains, for the express purpose of stretching witches.�� Iron prevents escape - both of the body, and
the spirit.� A witch fastened in iron
cannot transfer her spirit to a familiar or other unwitting host.� Admittedly the shackles will bite cruelly
into her wrists and ankles, much more so than ropes, but it is pain she will
soon not notice as the stretching begins.

����������� &quot;Austin?� If you please.&quot;

����������� My
two dungeon assistants take up their posts at the levers of the rack, and, at
my signal, begin to turn.� Music.� The slow click-click of the oiled
ratchets, the gentle creak of the rollers not yet stressed. The subtle knock of
chains on wood. Slowly, Kathy's splayed limbs are drawn parallel, her arms
above her head, her legs reaching long towards the foot of the rack.

����������� She
is looking at Austin, at the roller beyond her fingertips, in terror.� &quot;Please!&quot;

����������� &quot;Keep
turning,&quot; I order.

����������� Kathy's
body shifts minutely on the rack's surface, her heels drag a little on the
wood, her buttocks slide a fraction of an inch, her shoulder-blades draw in the
opposite direction.� Her fettered wrists
rise half an inch off the rack, her heels likewise raised by the growing
tension.

����������� I
watch, seeing the stretch take in her limbs.�
The signs are subtle; the defining of muscles, the tautening of tendons
through her thighs and armpits, the rising of her ribcage and the hollowing of
her belly.� Her breasts are lifted
towards the ceiling as the tension grows. The manacles wedge firmly against her
hands and feet, pulling in opposite directions, and the strain through her body
grows.

����������� Another
notch; another, another, another - click, click, click - and Kathy is stretched
further.� She gasps, and I signal a
halt.� Gently, I put my hand to her arm,
her belly, her thigh. All is taut, muscles rigid and straining.

����������� &quot;Enough,&quot;
I say.

����������� Kathy
manages to lift her head.� In the cool
dungeon air, her naked body is spread and vulnerable. Her breasts and armpits,
her belly, her sex, all presented and exposed.�
There is nothing quite as terrifying as being so very helpless, spread
for torture on the rack the way she is.�
&quot;You bitch,&quot; she hisses at me through clenched teeth.� &quot;Release me, or I promise, you will pay
for this.&quot;

����������� &quot;Is
that before or after you die screaming in flames?&quot; I reply coolly.� Kathy's eyes darken with hatred.� I glance at Austin.� &quot;Let us leave her.� We begin questioning in a few hours.&quot;

����������� Kathy
gives a groan, her head thuds back on the wood.

&nbsp;

����������� Torture
on the rack takes patience.

����������� Stretching
a victim too hard, too fast, will simply cause damage without making the most
of the rack's subtle power.� A victim's
immediate response to racking is to fight it, to resist the pull, and chances
are she will damage and dislocate her own joints in the process.� So a settling-in period is essential.

����������� Kathy
is suffering, and the racking hasn't even begun.

����������� Held
taut between the rollers, she is locked in an involuntary battle against the
tension in her limbs. Her muscles are tight. The sweat glosses her naked body,
the veins stand on her neck as she fights to resist.� But as time passes, her exhaustion grows.� Already her arms are weak from a night spent
hanging in chains, and the muscles quickly fail her. But still her abdomen,
back, thighs and calves are tight, and it is a long, slow process as, fibre by
fibre, the muscles begin to burn, cramp, and weaken.

����������� Two
hours, and she is losing the battle.� The
ache of fatigue is maddening, as if she has been lifting heavy weights.� But the rack maintains its tension, so as
muscles relax, the strain is instead transferred to the very ligaments and
tendons that hold her body together.

����������� This
is where the pain begins.

����������� Ligaments
were not made to take such punishment.�
They are the linking fibres between joints, and it is not in their
design to absorb stress.� Their protest
is felt as a deep, savage heat deep in her limbs, spreading from her shoulders
and elbows, down her spine, through her hips and knees.� Like slow fire it creeps along her bones, a
growing pain that quickens her breathing, breaks a sweat across her breasts
like droplets of condensation upon glass.

����������� Her
third hour on the rack is the worst.� The
pain has invaded to her core; it is her skeleton, her very bones, that seem to
burn and ache, an unreal savagery of pain that she cannot block out, no matter
how she tries.

����������� When
Austin, Steve and I enter the torture chamber, Kathy's head shifts and she
looks beyond the horizon of her own upstretched arm, fear plain to see on her
face.� She knows now how utterly
vulnerable she is.

����������� Austin
takes his position at the head of the rack, Steve at the foot, and I stand
alongside the machine, looking down at the wretched Kathy.� &quot;Confess, witch,&quot; I say.

����������� &quot;I
have nothing to confess,&quot; she groans.

����������� I
signal, and two winches turn.� The shift
is minuscule, barely perceptible, but to Kathy it awakens a fiery agony.� As her exhausted body stretches, pain flares
in her joints, along her limbs, and her mouth opens in a gasp of pain.� Her eyes grow wide.

����������� &quot;Oh
- God!� Oh God!� It hurts!&quot; she cries.

����������� &quot;Confess,
confess now,&quot; I urge.�
&quot;Agree to hear our questions and it will stop.&quot;

����������� Through
brimming tears, Kathy bites her lip and says nothing, so I signal again.� Again, the winches turn, her body stretches
between the rollers, and this time Kathy gives a lung-deep yell of pain.

����������� &quot;Aaaaaahhhhh!!&quot;� She drives her head back into the wood of the
rack, the tears now spilling from her eyes.�
The hot agony rips along her limbs, but also grows now like a savage
demon deep in the small of her back, spreading with crippling intensity up her
spine.

����������� &quot;This
is only the beginning, Kathy Linyd,&quot; I tell her.� &quot;The pain gets worse, and worse.� With this machine I can pull your joints
apart, but it will not end there.� You
will still stretch further.� Talk.&quot;

����������� &quot;I
... I ...&quot;� Kathy gasps, shakes her
head through the pain.

����������� My
signal cues the winches to click over again, and Kathy screams and shrieks in
pain as she stretches.� Her ribcage
lifts, the rack creaks.� Now, her screams
are constant, the fire of racking filling her drawn body.� The sweat streaks her ribcage and collects in
droplets over her quivering flesh as she howls in pain.� She is learning the true suffering of the
racked.

����������� &quot;Tell
me now that you are not a witch!&quot; I shout.

����������� &quot;Ohhhh
gooodddd!&quot; Kathy wails, her face screwed up in agony.� &quot;Mercy, please, have mercy, I cannot
bear this pain!&quot;� Her breathing is
rapid and shallow, the tension barely allowing her diaphragm to shift.

����������� I
bend over her, seize her face in my hand, guide it so that her pain-swimming
eyes are staring directly at me.� Framed
by her upstretched arms and her hollowed armpits, her face shows that she is
close to breaking.� &quot;It is
over.� You cannot resist this.� How many more notches do you wish to feel?� Confess!&quot;

����������� &quot;No
...&quot; Kathy manages to gasp.� Then,
horror in her eyes as I signal Austin and Steve to rack her another notch.

����������� The
winches creak, and a new magnitude of pain rips through Kathy's helpless
body.� She screams anew, her spine
popping and groaning with the tension that rips at her very bones.� Again she screams, draws breath,
screams.� Her shrieks echo from the stone
ceiling.� She is shaking her head over
and over.

����������� I
am about to signal the next notch, when Kathy Linyd shrieks, &quot;I confess
it!� Oh, I confess!� I am a witch!&quot;

����������� &quot;Say
it again,&quot; I tell her.

����������� &quot;I
am a witch!� Oh God, the pain �!&quot;

����������� &quot;You
have consorted with Satan?&quot;

����������� &quot;I
fucked him, I did it many times!� I am
evil!� I confess - please stop the
pain!!&quot;

����������� I
glance at Steve and Austin.� &quot;Ease
off a few notches only.&quot;

����������� The
winches groan.� The shift of her limbs is
slight, but the unbearable agony ebbs to a deep, unending fire. Still unbearable,
still terrible, but less all the same.�
Kathy's head rolls and shifts in her pain, she gasps air like a fish out
of water.� Her body is wet.

����������� &quot;Tell
us about Matmos. Where has he gone?&quot;

����������� &quot;I
don't know, I don't know!&quot; Kathy gasps.

����������� I
straighten, and turn to Austin.�
&quot;Heat the irons,&quot; I order.

&nbsp;

����������� Kathy
strains to see beyond her own arm and the imposing bulk of the rack's roller,
as Austin pumps the bellows.� Fanned by
the jetting air, the coals in the brazier roar, driving the iron implements to
red, to orange, to almost-white with heat.�
The radiance of the fire is scorching on my face.

����������� I
pull on a thick woollen mitten to protect my hand, and grasp one end of a long
brand, its tip a flat rectangle flowing furious yellow, two inches long and one
inch wide.� As I carry the brand to the
rack, it crackles in the chill air, incinerating invisible dust particles
brightly.

����������� Kathy's
eyes are wild with horror as she sees it.�
There may be more effective tortures, but nothing, it seems, invokes
such fear as hot irons.� Certainly, it is
the pain; but it is also the knowledge that, at a whim, the torturer can cause
such disfigurement.

����������� I
slowly move alongside the rack, the shimmering iron in my hand.� Kathy's eyes follow it, though she bites her
lower lip, saying nothing.� She is
learning, now, how utterly helpless she is; racked, she cannot even
struggle.� The pain is still severe
through her body, tearing her limbs, but her fear surfaces regardless.

����������� &quot;Answer
my question, Kathy Linyd,&quot; I say slowly.�
I have reached the end of the rack, and take Kathy's bare toes in my
hand.� Her foot is curled over by the
sheer tension of the manacles, but I force her toes up, stretching out the pale
sole of her foot.

����������� &quot;No,&quot;
Kathy finally whimpers.� Her toes twitch
in my grip.

����������� I
press the searing iron to the sole of Kathy's right foot.� There is a quick puff of smoke, a tiny burst
of flame, then a long, squealing hiss.�
It is almost a full second before the pain hits, and Kathy gives a long
scream of agony.� She cannot writhe,
cannot struggle, she can only twitch her toes and fling her head from side to
side, shrieking in pain as her own skin burns.�


����������� I
finally lift the iron, smoking, from her foot, leaving an evil red welt where
it has kissed her skin.� Kathy's scream
becomes a long wail, the searing pain barely fading even though the iron no
longer burns her.� I aim the iron for
another part of her sole, closer to her toes, and press it to the skin.� Again the hissing of searing flesh, again
Kathy's shrill screams of agony as she is burned.� I leave it for ten long seconds, then lift it
away, a charred residue of skin smoking on the iron.� Kathy moans, her taut ribcage shifting fast,
her head turning.

����������� &quot;No
more,&quot; she begs, &quot;no more!�
Please, I already confessed, I am a witch!&quot;

����������� &quot;You
know there is more to tell,&quot; I say.�
&quot;Talk.&quot;

����������� &quot;I
do not know what you want to hear,&quot; she weeps.

����������� I
return to the brazier, slide the branding iron back into its bed of coals, and
choose another instead.� This iron ends
in a smaller cross-shaped brand, an inch to each axis, and I bring it, smoking,
to Kathy's side.

����������� &quot;No,&quot;
she weeps, to see it.� &quot;No, no, no
�!&quot;� Her voice rises in pitch and
volume as I bring the iron close to the wet plateau of skin below her right
armpit, alongside her breast.� Her ribcage
heaves but she cannot struggle or move.�
I let her feel the radiant heat of the iron, then press it home.

����������� Steam
hisses and bursts around the flat of the branding iron, then smoke, and Kathy's
roar of pain rends the air, her mouth wide open, her eyes screwed shut.

����������� I
lift the iron, leaving a smoking wound.�
Kathy is bawling in her pain, but I mean to show her no mercy
whatsoever.� After only a few seconds, I
put the iron against her skin again, this time a little closer to her breast,
and she shrieks like a banshee in her agony.

����������� I
lift the iron and hold it, smoking with the residue of her own burnt skin, in
front of her rolling eyes.� &quot;Tell us
where Matmos has fled.&quot;

����������� It
is almost half a minute before Kathy is coherent enough to shake her head.� &quot;I don't kno-o-o-ow!&quot; she howls.

����������� &quot;You
do know, and you will tell us,&quot; I inform her.� As I return to the brazier, I tell Steve,
&quot;tighten her two notches.&quot;

����������� Kathy
is dazed by the brands, but she is ripped back to full awareness when Steve
takes hold of the winch beyond her feet and heaves.� The chains grate and scrape, the axle groans,
and Kathy's helpless body is once again stretched.� She screams in pain of course, frantic and
high-pitched, and there are creaking sounds from her limbs as they
lengthen.� The pain in her joints is
comparable to the searing pain of the iron, and her shrieks are testament to
her utter agony.

����������� I
switch to a new brand.� It crackles with
heat as I bring it over to her, a trail of smoke on the air.� Kathy lies shrieking and gasping from the
pain of being stretched, her head turning, every sinew and muscle taut on her
straining body.� She is in such pain that
she doesn't react to the glowing metal as it descends towards her; but when I
place it squarely in the valley of her armpit and press down, her scream
evolves into a lung-deep bellow of agony.�
Steam and smoke billows around the end of the brand as it impresses its
mark deep into sensitive flesh.

����������� I
peel the brand away after perhaps ten seconds, but Kathy keeps screaming.� Her voice has changed its timbre; hoarser,
thinner.� She is rapidly growing
exhausted from the torture.� I touch the
brand down again, an inch higher, and again she flings her head about, wailing
and screeching.� The acrid smell of
burning skin floods my nostrils once again.

����������� When,
at last, I withdraw the branding iron, Kathy's scream trails into a long wail,
then a whimper.� Her eyelids flutter and
her eyes roll back, her face grows pale.�
Without returning the iron to the coals, I grasp her jaw in my hand,
rocking her head side to side.

����������� &quot;Don't
think you can slip away that easily, Witch,&quot; I tell her.� &quot;Look at me!� Answer my questions!� Where is Matmos?� Who else have you associated with?� Tell me now, or it will only get worse!&quot;

����������� My
words are enough to draw Kathy back from her faint, and her eyes fix to mine,
swimming in pain and fear.� &quot;Please,
please, I don't know,&quot; she says weakly.

����������� I
release her face and return to the brazier.�
Austin still pumps the bellows, and I return the iron, drawing out the
cross-shaped brand again.� Once more it
glows almost white with heat.� &quot;I
hope you're enjoying this, then,&quot; I say.

����������� &quot;Oh,
no, no,&quot; Kathy sobs.� &quot;Mercy,
have mercy!&quot;

����������� Progress.� I return to the rack, show her the smoking
tip of the iron, then press it down between her shining breasts.� Life returns to Kathy's voice as she gives a
horrible scream of agony.� Her flesh
sizzles and spits beneath the iron's touch.�
I let it burn, all the way to the bone, before tearing it up from her
ravaged sternum.� Two inches lower, and
the iron is pressed down again. Again, Kathy's screams and shrieks of pain as
her flesh burns deep.

����������� When
the smoking iron is lifted, I count the brands.�
She is lasting well, most witches would have long ago been inventing
lies just to save themselves the agony. �That's not to say that I'm running out of
options; but she's tough.

����������� Returning
to the brazier, I pull on the second woollen glove, and with both hands, grasp
the handles of the pincers. The scissors-like implement is made of heavy iron,
ending in claws that glow bright and yellow in the dim air. I move to Kathy's
left side and brandish the pincers before her face, opening them wide like the
mandibles of some gigantic insect.

����������� Kathy's
eyes are huge in horror. &quot;No - no - NO!!&quot;

����������� I
bring the pincers down and close them on Kathy's full and shining breast.� The squealing, the pop of steam, and
then the screaming.� Oh, the screaming;
she bellows and roars, her voice sounding barely human in its long, drawn-out
caws of agony.� I turn and tug the
pincers, twisting and pulling her breast while the burning goes on.� Unable to struggle, Kathy just lies on the
rack and screams.

����������� Finally,
I release her breast and withdraw the iron from her smoking, steaming
flesh.� Kathy turns her head and vomits a
small spurt of water over her own armpit, groaning and wailing from the
magnitude of it all.� The pincers still
glow orange, so I lower them again, this time closing the claws onto the
cinnamon stub of her erect nipple. Screams split the air again, with the
sizzling, squealing sound of burning skin.�
I wrench the pincers around, twisting her nipple like the stalk of an
apple, until there is nothing left but a charred nub that once was sensitive
flesh.

����������� When
I lift the iron away, the wounds on her breast are ghastly.� Kathy is shaking her head and sobbing, from
pain, and from knowing that her once perfect breast has been ruined.� &quot;Tell me what you know, and it
stops.� Refuse, and I burn you
again.&quot;

����������� Kathy's
head lolls.� Mucus streams from her nose,
tears from her eyes, mixing with the sweat on her drawn face.� Her lips move, but her words are
garbled.� It seems she is weakening from
the torture.

����������� But
it could be a ploy.� Just to make sure, I
return the pincers to the brazier and draw out a fresh branding iron.� I return to her left side, aim it squarely
between breast and underarm, and press it to her skin.� She shrieks and wails and turns her head, but
the scream is somehow distant, agony without awareness.� I let it burn her nevertheless, until I am
satisfied that she is truly insensible, then pull it from her flesh.

����������� I
sigh.

����������� &quot;Steve,
Austin, I think we should rest now.&quot;

����������� &quot;She
is weak,&quot; Austin notes.� &quot;She
needs to recover.&quot;

����������� I
nod.� &quot;Loosen her, five notches each
wheel, and let her breathe a little.�
Then give her water.� We resume in
a few hours.&quot;

����������� I
am glad I put Kathy on the rack.

����������� I
had thought of using the horse, and the pear, as I had with Janet.� But the horse can be endured; and I have
known women to bear through the torture of the pear, until the damage is such
that death is inevitable, and thus it becomes their salvation. Irons, too, can
be resisted.� It is rare, but I have
witnessed it.� The pain, though intense,
is relatively brief, and too many burns can create more problems.� I know already that she would be stronger
than the water torture, and while the thumbscrews might have forced her
confession, I doubt they would coax the truth about Matmos and Daffy from her lips.

����������� The
rack, on the other hand, holds the key to breaking her.� It has already drawn a confession of
witchcraft from her, and the racking we gave her was only mild.� The pain of the rack grows incrementally, and
by its nature is more powerful than the thumbscrews, the horse, the brands or
the pear.

����������� She
lies, now, recovering from the brandings. Stretched still, taut enough so that
her wearied muscles will not regain their strength, but loose enough so she can
catch breath and recover her senses.

����������� She
will break on the rack.� She must break.

����������� 

����������� In
the orange-lit gloom of the torture chamber, against the dark wood of the rack,
Kathy Linyd's stretched body looks as if it is polished with oil.� She does not move - she can not move -
but lies, pulled between the rollers, secured in a world of misery and pain.

����������� The
brands on her body are red and raw, yet another source of pain for the
witch.� To hear our return, a groan of
terror escapes her lips.

����������� How
many hours has she lain on the rack, now?�
Six?� Seven, or more?� It is a long time to suffer its torment.� Now, as Austin and Steve take their places at
either winch, I am certain that Kathy has no strength whatsoever in her arms
and legs.� Every tiny turn of the rack is
going to be felt in every joint, every ligament, in every vertebrae.� Casually, I place the hourglass, used to
measure half-hour increments, on the wooden bed alongside her.

����������� &quot;Wake
her,&quot; I say.

����������� The
two men pull on their levers, and the winches groan.� As the chains pull on Kathy's straining
limbs, the fire of agony rips through her.�
I see her eyes fly open, her mouth too, and a hoarse scream rises from
her throat, echoing through the chamber.

����������� &quot;You
are with us, then,&quot; I note.

&quot;Aaaaaahhh!!� Oh God, it hu-u-u-urts!&quot; Kathy cries
out.� 

����������� &quot;It
is just a whisper of the pain you will feel soon,&quot; I promise her.

����������� &quot;What
do you want from me?� Please, please, I
beg you,&quot; she shrieks, &quot;please, I have confessed, I am a witch, there
is no more I can say!&quot;

����������� &quot;Tell
us where Matmos is hiding.&quot;

����������� &quot;I
don't know, I don't know!&quot;

����������� &quot;Rack
her,&quot; I say.� &quot;Five
notches.&quot;

����������� The
winches roll over again. Kathy screams in pain. A second notch. A third.� Kathy's voice takes on a new sound, a thin
wail of agony as, creaking like leather, her body is stretched further and
further.� Her whole body begins to lift
from the rack's surface, taut as a bow-string between the rollers, and the
agony is fire along her bones, spreading up her spine from the small of her
back like metal barbs tearing at her very core.

����������� Another
notch, then another. Stretched almost to breaking point, Kathy shrieks and
bellows in agony.

����������� I
wait.� Circling the rack, watching her
scream and cry, noting each taut muscle, each straining rib, the shallow
heaving of her breasts - one perfect, one scarred by torture.� The veins in her neck stand out in her
efforts not to lose all sanity.

����������� Then,
I signal.� Again, the winches turn.� Kathy is already screaming, but makes a sound
almost like a woman in orgasm as her body stretches again. This time, I hear a
distinctive sound from her left shoulder, like breaking a green twig from a
tree, and I see her entire arm visibly shift and lengthen.� Kathy's howls and shrieks are proof of the
agony as her shoulder shifts out of joint.

����������� It
is a matter of seconds before I hear the same sound from her right shoulder,
and it, too, dislocates. Kathy's head hangs back between her disjointed arms as
she roars in agony, the pain beyond anything she has felt before.

����������� I
lean close and grasp her hair, lift her head from the rack.� &quot;Listen to me, Kathy!&quot;� She manages somehow to bite down on her
screams, clenching her teeth so hard they might break, the veins at her temples
pulsing, the tears streaming from her eyes.�
&quot;Look at yourself!� You are
breaking apart!� I'm tearing your limbs
from your body! Doesn't it hurt?� Doesn't
it feel like the very agonies of Hell?&quot;

����������� Incapable
of words, Kathy simply tries to nod.

����������� &quot;I
can rack you further, Kathy. Much further. You can be stretched until your
elbows and knees pull apart, your hips pop from their sockets. Even then, you
can be stretched further still, until your vertebrae begin to come apart.� And when you have been stretched to the very
brink of death, I can reset your bones and start all over again.� And the second time will be twice as painful
as the first.� Do you want that,
Kathy?&quot;

����������� She
shakes her head.

����������� &quot;Two
more notches,&quot; I order.

����������� Kathy
begins to form the word, &quot;no,&quot; but it simply becomes an inarticulate
roar of pain as the rollers click, click again and her disjointed arms
are pulled further from her body.� Her
elbows, hips and knees begin to groan and creak.

����������� &quot;Where
is Matmos?&quot; I ask.

����������� Kathy
mouths the words, I don't know, so I let her head drop back.� I turn the hourglass, and step back.

����������� The
sand runs slowly through.� Kathy wails
and shrieks and groans.� Her body is
burning from within, as if the fire of her incineration has already been lit,
and smoulders within her bones.� It is
agony beyond understanding, beyond belief, focused with relentless intensity in
every joint.� I know that she cannot
think, cannot focus, cannot do anything but feel.

����������� It
is twenty minutes later that her left elbow separates with a crack! and
her arm fractionally lengthens as the joint dislocates.� Kathy's voice explodes in a new scream of
agony, her head twisting about, even as her right elbow pulls apart also.� Her arms are now strung together by the ligaments
alone, and the agony is immense.

����������� We
must rack her carefully, now.� Stretched
slowly, she will be broken according to the size and strength of her joints;
her hips next, then knees, then wrists and ankles, and finally her vertebrae.� Too fast, and ligaments will separate from
bone, and she will never recover.� 

����������� But
that is a long way off.

����������� Half
an hour has passed, and I nod to Austin and Steve.� They return to the winches, take hold of the
worn wooden handles.� I move close, to
stand over Kathy.� Her face is pale, she
groans with every shallow breath.� Her
armpits are up around her temples, now, and her ribcage looks as if it is about
to burst from her body.� Her belly is tight
and drawn.

����������� &quot;Where
is Matmos?&quot;

����������� There
is no response, so I signal the next turn.�
The rollers creak, and Kathy gives�
a new scream of agony as her broken body is stretched.� Almost at once, a pop! comes from her
left hip, and it snaps from its socket with a jarring vibration that sends a
shudder through her entire body. 

Different bodies break in
different ways.� An older witch will
suffer more damage than a younger one; but at five feet seven inches, and still
young and healthy, Kathy will stretch and stretch, anywhere from six to nine
inches.� I watch with satisfaction as Kathy's
right hip dislocates neatly, and her screams are like those of a woman
possessed.

I turn the hourglass.

����������� Kathy's
screams have shortened.� It is
inevitable; even breathing is an effort, and added to the terrible agony of
racking comes the panic of near-suffocation.�
Her body, spread and shining, is so easily hurt.� And as the hours pass and her ligaments
inflame in reaction to the tearing damage caused by the rack, her pain will
simply grow and grow.

����������� A
half hour after the turn that disjointed both her hips, I command another turn
of the roller. Even hearing my order, Kathy begins begging for mercy in a
desperate whisper, but when the rollers shift, she finds voice again, a broken
roar of pain as her creaking body extends again.� There is a series of pops again from
her spine, and I know the pain must be like knives driven into her back,
rivalling that of her pulled-apart joints.

����������� When
at last she is unable to scream any more, Kathy simply moans.� I lean over her again.� &quot;It gets worse,&quot; I promise.� &quot;In a few hours, when all of your joints
have been ripped apart, I will leave you like this.� I will sleep, and you will lie here and
suffer an eternity of Hell in every moment.�
The pain will grow and grow.

����������� &quot;Then,
by morning, when we return, I will begin stretching you further and further,
pulling and pulling, until -&quot;

����������� &quot;Cottage,&quot;
Kathy gasps in a tiny voice.� &quot;They
have a cottage!&quot;

����������� I
quickly signal Austin and Steve to take the levers again, and they do so.� &quot;Matmos and his witches?� You speak of them?&quot;

����������� &quot;Yes!&quot;

����������� &quot;They
have a cottage?&quot;

����������� &quot;Yes!&quot;

����������� Finally.� &quot;Where?&quot;

����������� &quot;In
the woods � five miles in from where � the road north � crosses a stream,&quot;
she gives, in desperate agonised bursts.�


����������� &quot;They
hide there?&quot;

����������� &quot;Yes!� Yes, yes, yes!&quot; she weeps.

����������� &quot;Who
else is with him? Name them.&quot;

����������� &quot;I
don't know,&quot; Kathy wails.

����������� I
give the signal, and the rollers shift.�
Kathy's screaming is high and terrible, her groaning limbs forced
fractionally longer.� It takes her long
minutes to find words again, and when they come, they repeat over and over:
&quot;I don't know, I don't know, oh God, please, I don't know!&quot;

����������� I
frown.� I want to rack her further,
torture her more to be certain she speaks the truth, but she is already showing
signs of slipping into a state of near-dementia from the pain.� She has been under torture for an entire day,
and even one as young and strong as Kathy can only endure so much.

����������� I
straighten.� &quot;If you are lying to
me, Kathy Linyd, God help you, because I will have you racked for three days
without pause, do you understand?&quot;

����������� &quot;I
swear it,&quot; Kathy gasps.

����������� I
slowly nod.� &quot;Very well.&quot;� To Austin and Steve, I say, &quot;I will
fetch the physician so we can loosen her.&quot;

����������� Both
give their approval.

With joints to be reset and
ligaments needing time to retract, it will take an hour to release Kathy from
the rack.� But once again, our efforts
have ended successfully.

&nbsp;

����������� I
have been instructed to re-examine the witch Kathy Linyd.

����������� Her
wails are terrible as she is dragged from her cell, and not just because she
knows she is to be tortured.� Every joint
in her body is badly inflamed, muscles strained, and it is agony to move.� Her spine is cruelly swollen, and the fire of
damaged tendons and muscle fibres have left her temporarily crippled.

����������� When
she glimpses the torment I have in store, she openly weeps.� Alongside a sturdy wooden whipping-frame, a
table is laid out with the instruments to be used in her questioning: the
hourglass, the pitcher of lard, and a pear, ornate and grotesque.� Even closed, it is larger than a man's
clenched fist.� 

����������� &quot;Oh,
I beg you, I beg you, do not!&quot; Kathy shrieks as she is carried to the
frame.� &quot;What more do you want from
me?&quot;

����������� &quot;We
want the truth, Kathy,&quot; I say.

����������� &quot;What?� But - oh, I swear it, I swear it, I
have told you the truth!&quot;

����������� Her
protest is not enough to save her; the guards hoist her up, and her wrists,
purple with bruising already from her horror upon the rack, are set widely
apart in manacles high above her head.�
Naked, she is left to dangle, and a great scream tears her lungs as the
pain of her damaged shoulders is cruelly reawakened.

����������� But
it gets worse.� Her ankles are drawn
widely apart, so that her toes clear the floor by several inches, and she is
shackled; hanging spreadeagled, her joints and muscles burning in terrible
agony, her body exposed front and back.

����������� &quot;Take
me down!� I cannot stand it!� Take me down!&quot; she pleads, agonised by
her suspension.� But it is not my
decision to make, and I stand before her, gazing up into her pain-filled eyes.

����������� &quot;You
lied to us, Kathy.� We went to the
cottage, but there was nobody there.� The
Man In Black, Matmos, or any of his witches, were nowhere to be found.� We want to know where they are!&quot;

����������� &quot;How
should I know?&quot; Kathy shrieks in terror verging on nausea.� &quot;Oh, by God, I do not know!� Please!&quot;

����������� &quot;Then
you had better search your memory, because the truth must be known.&quot;

����������� I
walk calmly behind her, step to the table, and dip my fingers into the jar of
cold lard.� Kathy's drawn body is already
heaving in pained breaths as she dangles from the manacles.� From behind, I regard the taut globes of her
buttocks, the peeping copper-haired secret of her sex, and I carefully slide my
hand between her thighs.� She jolts to
feel my hand touch her most intimate part, as I smear the lard over her
lips.� &quot;No!&quot; she shrieks.

����������� I
take up the pear.� It is heavy, solid; it
looks immense in my small hands.� Such a
cruel instrument of persuasion, and yet so beautiful in its crafting; the
intricacy of design upon its folded petals.

����������� Kathy
is sobbing.� &quot;Please, it
hurts,&quot; she begs.� &quot;I have confessed
that I am a witch.� I have told you all I
know of the ones you seek.� I know
nothing else!&quot;

����������� I
say nothing, but crouch down behind her, looking up between her legs.� Her sex is there presented, labia slightly
parted by the wide spreading of her ankles; the dungeon torch-light catches the
fine curls of her pubic hair.� It pains
me to so ravage the delicate flower of her femininity; but I have been
instructed, and I will do as I am bid.

����������� I
place the cold metal tip of the pear against the entrance to Kathy Linyd's
vagina, and push it upwards.� She screams
and squeals as the metal intruder forces her wide, wider than she has ever
been; it takes effort on my part, all the strength of my arms and back, and her
ankles jam against their fetters with the force of it.� But aided by the lard, the pear slides inside
her, deeper and deeper, plundering her.�
She screams.� Further, deeper I
force it; its girth displacing her cervix, making her cry out in pain and
distress, until finally it comes to rest, deep inside her sex.

����������� I
stand, gather up a towel and clean my hands, circle my spreadeagled
victim.� Now, only a gleaming brass
turnscrew protrudes down between her spread legs, ending in the key-like handle
for turning.

����������� A
single tear lands on Kathy's unbranded breast, slides over its gentle curve.

����������� &quot;I
beg you,&quot; she gasps, &quot;take it out!�
It hurts!� You are killing
me!&quot;

����������� I
can feel the tears in my own eyes.�
&quot;The truth, Kathy.� Give me
the truth and it will be over.&quot;

����������� &quot;I
swear to you,&quot; Kathy sobs, &quot;I don't know!&quot;

����������� I
reach between her spread thighs and grasp the turnscrew in both hands.� Kathy's voice becomes a shriek.� &quot;No - no, no!!&quot;

����������� I
turn the screw - once, twice, three times.�
From deep within her, a muffled groan as the pear's terrible flower
shifts and blossoms almost two inches wider, sending a terrible agony through
her.� She screams in pain, flinging her
head back between her upstretched arms, her hair swinging against her straining
back.

����������� I
stand, turn the hourglass.� To the
guards: &quot;leave me with her.� I will
send for you, and for the scribe, when she has something worthwhile to
say.&quot;

The guards return to their
posts; and I leave Kathy to her torture.

Any woman can perhaps
understand the nature of pain that must be felt from the pear, but not its
magnitude.� Not even the pain of
childbirth can compare.

Kathy hangs from her wrists,
racked by her own damaged joints, her body shining sweat, the handle of the
pear protruding from between her outstretched legs.� She shrieks and groans endlessly, unable to
stay still, at the pain of the pear inside her.

����������� I
give her half an hour to suffer, before making my return.� Her distress grows at seeing me.� &quot;Help me, please,&quot; she begs.

����������� &quot;Where
is Matmos now?&quot;

����������� Kathy
does not want to answer.� She dreads the
question, and when it comes, she does not have the courage to give a
reply.� She knows what the result will
be, and on cue I reach beneath her widened thighs and grasp the turnscrew.

����������� &quot;Where,
Kathy?� Where are they?� Think, Kathy!&quot;

����������� I
twist the screw.� Another slow creak from
her vagina as the pear opens further; I see the shift in her lower abdomen, and
Kathy's scream is shrill and long.� She
shakes her tortured limbs, swinging as far as the tautened chains will allow,
but she is helpless to the pear's terrible agony.

����������� I
watch her screaming.� The agony goes on
and on; she is a creature stripped of dignity, stripped of free will, whose
existence is pain and nothing more.� I
give her time to call 'enough' and tell what she knows; but she merely hangs
there and screams.

����������� I
turn the hourglass and leave.

����������� She
is silent when I finally return.� For
more than an hour, she has hung in the shackles, agonised, with the pear buried
up inside her.� From the bulge in her
abdomen, she looks pregnant.� The tears
have worn streaks down her face, down her grubbied breasts; the sweat shines on
her taut body.� Her head hangs forward;
she is exhausted.

����������� But
hearing my footsteps, she raises her chin, and looks at me with eyes that are
dark with suffering.� &quot;No more
...&quot; she begs.

����������� &quot;You
still resist me,&quot; I say sadly.�
&quot;Why do you do it?&quot;

����������� &quot;I
gave you all I knew,&quot; Kathy insists, and her voice shakes in dread.

����������� I
am running out of time to wrest the truth from her; she is growing weak
already.� I put my hands to the
turnscrew, and with Kathy shrieking in terror, I twist it firmly.� A muted crack! sounds from deep inside
her, the pear spreads its petals into her womb.�
Her screams are terrible.� I twist
again, and it opens yet further.

����������� &quot;No!� No-o-o-o-o!!!!&quot; she bellows, over and
over again.� Her screams echo off stone
walls, and must be chilling the bones of other prisoners in forgotten cells.� For good measure, I turn the handle of the
pear again; the bulge in her belly grows by a fraction, the pain roars ever
greater.

����������� I
step back again and watch her hang, watch her scream and suffer.� It is as if the demons have already come for
her soul; her tortured eyes roll as her head rocks back and forth, side to
side, in endless, restless agony.

����������� I
turn the hourglass, and leave her to her pain.

����������� In
my room off the passageway, mere paces from the torture chamber's locked door,
I make a brief report to the waiting Witchseekers, urging them to be patient;
then return to my never-ending studies of human anatomy, and the finer points
of hurting it.

����������� The
half-hour passes quickly, for me.� It
must feel like an eternity for Kathy.�
When I return, she hangs as she did when I left.� Groaning.�
Agonised.

����������� &quot;Does
she speak the truth, yet?&quot;

����������� The
voice, behind me, belongs to Tina.� I am
not surprised that she has come; Kathy's false lead regarding Matmos caused
great embarrassment.� Part of me suspects
that this further torture is as much punishment as inquisition, and that Kathy
really has told all that she knows.

����������� &quot;Not
yet,&quot; I say.

����������� Tina's
eyes have a strange look as she notes Kathy's racked and sweat-streaked body,
spread suspended in shackles, with the bulge of the pear in her abdomen.� &quot;Turn the screw,&quot; she says.� &quot;I want to see it happen.&quot;

����������� I
go to Kathy and kneel between her opened legs, take the turnscrew in my
hands.� At my touch of the device, Kathy
squeals in renewed agony; and when the screw turns and the pear's segments edge
wider, she seems to tear her throat with shrieking.� Tina's face shows her fascination with
Kathy's agony.

����������� Minutes
pass, and Kathy's screams slowly ease as exhaustion again overwhelms her, and
the pain becomes a roar that leaves her dazed and endlessly stirring.� I stand before her, then, and demand again,
&quot;tell us everything you know, Kathy.�
Where is Matmos?�

����������� Kathy
makes no reply.� Her eyes no longer fix
on anything, but slide about in her disorientation and pain.

����������� &quot;Make
her talk,&quot; Tina says.� &quot;Find
the truth.� Failure would reflect poorly
upon you, as you well know.&quot;

����������� There
is little doubt as to the power behind Tina's threat, and I nod hastily.

����������� When
she has gone, I return my attention to Kathy.�
Silence is dangerous, and her groans are becoming more and more
faint.� I know I haven't yet torn her
womb, nor caused any lasting injury, but she risks fading into shock.

����������� &quot;Kathy!&quot;
I call.

����������� My
voice brings her back; her eyes find me.�
She mouths one word; please.

����������� I
move closer, and place my foot on the taut chain that runs from her left ankle
to the base of the frame.� I push
downward.� The force acts as a rack,
adding tension that spreads up her leg, aggravating the inflamed muscles of her
back, the damaged joints and ligaments in her shoulders and arms, and she gives
a wail of pain.

����������� &quot;Please,
please, please,&quot; she begs.

����������� &quot;Do
you realise what happens if you do not tell me what I need to hear?&quot; I
ask.� &quot;You will be taken down from
here, but returned instead to the rack.�
Imagine how that will feel, as all your joints are stretched again.� Imagine the sound as they pull apart all over
again.� Imagine the pain,
Kathy.&quot;

����������� &quot;Audrey,&quot;
she says.

����������� &quot;What?&quot;

����������� &quot;Audrey
... Rose ...&quot;

����������� &quot;Who
is Audrey Rose?� A witch?&quot;

����������� Kathy
nods.

����������� &quot;And
does she know where we will find The Man In Black?&quot;

����������� Again,
Kathy nods.

����������� It
is not much, but I am sure, now, that it is the last drop of information she
possesses. I put my hand to the pear's screw and gently begin to end Kathy�s
suffering.














I grew up to the sound of witches screaming

����������� Audrey
Rose is dragged into the torture chamber between two guards.� She is prettier than I had thought; tall and
slender, her skin pale and unblemished, straight black hair brushing her bare
shoulders.� Her hands are shackled behind
her back; besides the manacles iron, she wears nothing.� Her bare feet skid on the flagstones in her
fear.

����������� She
sees me, and freezes for a moment.�
Shock.� Bewilderment.� What is a woman doing in the torture
chamber?� I wear a simple strappy top -
perhaps a little summery for the chill of the chamber - with jeans, boots and
heels.� I look as if I might have simply
stepped in here on the way to the mall.

����������� &quot;So
you are the one they call Audrey Rose?&quot; I say.� Her blue eyes watch my slow approach, with
caution.� &quot;My name is Kirsten.� And I am here to find the Truth from
you.&quot;� My eyes indicate a momentary
reference to the vaulted chamber behind me, then return to Audrey's face, which
grows pale at her comprehension of my words.�
Her own eyes, then, more slowly pan the torture chamber. The vile
machines, the great shapes, the dangling chains and irons.

����������� &quot;I
will tell you the truth,&quot; she says quickly.� &quot;I lied about my name when I was
captured, because I was afraid. But now I have nothing to hide. I am Audrey
Rose, I admit that; but I am not a witch.&quot;

����������� &quot;Oh!&quot;� I put a hand to my mouth. &quot;You're not?
You mean, your arrest was a mistake? But - how dreadful!� How could it happen?&quot;

����������� Audrey
looks, from me to the guards, in confusion touched with hope. But it is dashed
in another moment as my hand drops away, and I smile at her with derision.
&quot;The lies of witches are always the same.�
You will give the truth only when you are ready to.&quot;� I direct the guards: &quot;put her on the
rack and make her secure.&quot;

����������� &quot;Noo-ooo!!&quot;
Audrey shrieks, as she is dragged to the dark machine.

����������� I
yawn.

����������� Perhaps
it is terrifying for the witch.� After
all, she is a virgin to torture; she has never suffered it before.� But me, I have inflicted it many times. Her
struggles are familiar, and predictable; her tugging legs, her wrists still
shackled behind her, as the guards spread her ankles widely and fasten them in
the manacles that run on chains to the lower roller.� Then they free her wrists, and push her
backwards, and for a moment she fights, her back arching off the wood and her
breasts thrusting upwards as she fights to break free.� But the guards are well-drilled, and pin her
quickly and effectively, using their weight and strength to draw first one arm,
and then the other, to the rounded iron manacles, fastening her wrists to the
top roller.

����������� When
it is done, she lies sobbing, spreadeagled and naked, upon the wood.� The guards, frustrated and hot, are only too
ready to take the levers and wind the rollers over.

����������� When
the rack first turns, its axles grinding and creaking, Audrey fights it.� Her slim muscles tense and tauten, her hands
close into fists about the chains, and she seeks to brace herself against the
leverage.� She should save herself the
effort; she is drawn slowly longer by the winding chains, until the slack is
taken from her young limbs, her wrists and ankles rise off the bed of wood.

����������� Finally,
she is pulled to her body's fullest extent.�
That is when the panic enters her eyes, realizing that she is drawn and
taut, and yet, somehow, the machine will wrench inch after inch from her.

����������� &quot;Please,&quot;
she gasps.

����������� I
signal the guards, a subtle hand-signal beyond Audrey's line of sight, and the
rollers shift again; once, twice, three times.�
The shackles bed against her wrists and ankles, they pull, the winches
groan, and an extra inch is dragged from Audrey's body.

����������� She
is uncomfortably tight. Not painfully, but enough for her muscles to be engaged
in a struggle to absorb the tension and protect her ligaments from harm.

����������� I
stand alongside the rack, and show her the implement I hold in my hand.� &quot;Do you know what this is?&quot;

����������� She
knows.� I can see from the furrowing of
her brow, the battle to contain her fear.�
The pear.� This is small,
only the size of my own fist.� She gives
no reply, though, so I say, &quot;it is an oral pear.&quot;

����������� I
see Audrey's jaw tighten.� It is a
touching gesture, a naive attempt to prevent the inevitable. I simply lift my
chin and the guards are reaching between Audrey's upstretched arms, grasping
her head and jaw. �She begins groaning
and grunting through tightly-clenched teeth, but the hand pushing down on her
chin quickly becomes unbearable.� She
begins to wail and cry out as her mouth is forced open.� I am fast to fit the end of the pear between
her teeth and push.� Audrey fights, but
the pear impels its way in, her mouth forced wider, until the metal bulb is
completely inside.� Once it is in, her
teeth and lips close around its tapering base so that only the turnscrew
protrudes.� It is a bizarre sight.

����������� She
keeps her eyes away from me.� Her shining
breasts are heaving fast with her efforts.�
The pear in her mouth fills it completely, pressing her tongue down, her
cheeks hollowed, face stretched around its metal circumference.

����������� I
put my hand on the turnscrew.� Audrey
whimpers, her voice oddly reverberant through the metal of the pear, and her
eyes flick to me, pleading, begging.� She
tries to shake her head.� I smile, and
twist the screw.� Inside her mouth, the
pear expands, pressing on her teeth, forcing her jaw wider.� I turn it again, then once more, watching as
Audrey's jaw is cranked steadily further open.�
There is a muted crack, just gas in the joint, but already it
will be painful.� Her eyes are watering.

����������� I
turn it once more, her mouth stretches open.�
I watch the growing discomfort and ache spread across her face.

����������� &quot;If
all we would hear are lies,&quot; I tell her, &quot;it is best we hear nothing
at all.� When we return, it will be to
begin your torture.� And when I let you
speak, it will be to hear the truth.&quot;

����������� Audrey's
frightened eyes watch our departure.

&nbsp;

����������� Four
hours is a good length time to leave her.

����������� In
four hours, Audrey's muscles lose their strength, her body becoming ever-more
helpless to the constant tension of the rack.�
The burn of strain builds in her ligaments, so that it feels as if her
very bones are growing hot.

����������� Four
hours is long enough also for the ache of the pear in Audrey's mouth to become
truly painful.� Her jaw has rarely been
stretched so wide, and never for such a long time, and the ache builds into a
pain deep in the joint, hurting her cheeks, making her teeth throb in slow
waves.� Her lips are dry, stretched
around the metal of the pear.�� 

And four hours
is long enough for Audrey Rose to dwell on her fear, for it to build and grow,
a knot in her guts that gnaws at her and makes her heart flutter within her
expanded ribcage. The sweat creeps and beads in her armpits, between her
buttocks, along her hairline, until she can smell the scent of it.

����������� We
finally return. The door bangs open, and the three of us stride towards the
rack, where our victim lies exactly as we left her, four hours earlier. She has
been waiting for us; she has been able to do nothing else.

����������� My
assistants take up the rollers at the head and foot of the rack. I stand, and
look Audrey's drawn and exhausted body up and down. The sheen of sweat, the
pale of her skin beneath the slow-burning torches. Her contorted face, the
handle of the pear protruding from her wide-stretched mouth.

����������� &quot;Rack
her,&quot; I say.

����������� The
first turn brings pain, fiery and savage through her joints, along her
muscles.� She gives a hollow moan through
the opened pear. 

The rollers
click slowly, a single notch every five to ten minutes; the stretching is
excruciatingly slow, and excruciatingly painful. At the next notch, the first
scream escapes through the pear in her mouth. From there, it just gets worse
for her. Audrey screams in pain as her limbs creak and groan, and the rack
stretches her slowly further.

����������� She
is racked for an hour.� The long spaces
in between each creak and groan of the turning rollers are filled with her
inarticulate bellows and cries; her life has become a nightmare. By now, as the
inches have been wrested from her long and willowy frame, it must feel as if
her very bones have been ripped from their sockets; and with the pear
distending her mouth will feel as if her jaw has been cracked open.

����������� I
inspect her body carefully.� Her pale
arms are drawn and taut, the muscles hard with strain; her suffering face is
framed by her pale, shaven underarms, wet with the sweat of fear and pain.� Her breasts have been drawn almost flat, but
rosy-pink nipples thrust innocently into the chill air, inviting the agonies
that could be inflicted upon them.�� Her
ribcage stands in corrugations, streaked with sweat; her belly is hollowed by
the strain, her belly-button rising and falling rapidly with shortened
breath.� Her hip-bones and the pale skin
of her loins are in contrast to the raven triangle of her pubic hair, which
modestly veils the anatomy of her womanhood.�
Her legs, long and supple, are straining and stretched towards the
roller.� It is as if all the color of her
body has gone into her now-crimson hands and feet, misshapen and squashed
beyond the manacles.

����������� She
groans in agony.

����������� She
is indeed beautiful, it would be easy for her to bewitch men and women
alike.� I can see that both the guards
are smitten with her body, both as hard as wood for her.

����������� Slowly,
I reach out and gently touch Audrey's distended jaw.� She squeals with the pain, her eyes huge, her
grunts and wuffles desperate as I put my hand to the screw of the pear.� &quot;Shhh,&quot; I tell her.� &quot;I am going to remove it.� But you must not make a sound, not cry out,
and when I ask you a question, you will tell me the truth.� Do you understand?&quot;

����������� Yes,
yes!

����������� It
hurts as I close the pear, and the pressure on her jaw eases for the first time
in many long hours.� But true to her
promise, she makes no sound, even though the pain of the rack fills her eyes
with tears and floods her brow with sweat.�
When I withdraw the pear, it strings out a trail of her saliva, and her
mouth closes only slowly, her jaw sprained from the torture.

����������� &quot;The
charges against you are solid, Audrey Rose,&quot; I say.� &quot;You were seen dancing naked, around the
fire. You were seen to touch yourself -&quot; my eyes flick to her pubic thatch
- &quot;down there. You were seen talking to a cat, a dumb creature. How do you
answer to these charges?� Do you deny the
evidence?&quot;

����������� In
the moments before she answers, we both hear the slow creak of her own joints,
pulled almost to breaking point.� The
pain is so great that her chin trembles, her curled fingers shake beyond the
manacles.

����������� &quot;I
am not a witch,&quot; she manages to gasp.

����������� The
guards fix their fists around the levers of the rack, and Audrey Rose finally
gives in to a shriek of pain and terror, but I signal them to wait.� Instead, I put my hand on her drum-tight
belly as she wails.� &quot;You poor
girl,&quot; I say.� &quot;It is the
truth, isn't it?&quot;

����������� &quot;Yes,&quot;
she squeaks.� A trickle of sweat runs
from her temple.� &quot;� Please, it
hurts so very much!&quot;

����������� &quot;I
do not believe you are deliberately lying,&quot; I say.

����������� &quot;Then
� you will � take me off �?&quot; she gasps.

����������� &quot;No.� You are not deliberately lying, because you believe
the lies.� You are confused by the chaos
of your sins, you have blacked out the reality and think yourself
innocent.� Only pain, pure and severe,
can bring back the clarity of innocence.&quot;

����������� Audrey
Rose's eyes grow huge.� &quot;Noooooo!!
�No, no, you are wrong, please, you
are wrong, I am innocent!&quot;

����������� &quot;Rack
her further,&quot; I say.

����������� The
screams are terrible as she is stretched again.�
But even though she has suffered multiple turns of the rollers, her
muscles are only strained, her joints sprained; a woman of her youth and
suppleness can be racked cruelly and still recover.� I watch her as she lies bellowing in her
agony, her eyes filled with the horror and bewilderment of such overwhelming,
indescribable pain.

����������� &quot;Soon
your shoulders will dislocate,&quot; I tell her calmly.� &quot;You will know when it happens; they
will 'pop' and suddenly your armpits will be up above your ears, and the pain
will be � beyond anything you could imagine.&quot;� I smile.�
&quot;But that is nothing compared to the pain when your elbows
pull apart.&quot;

����������� She
cannot do anything but give high-pitched mewling sounds of agony, her eyes
unseeing, staring at the ceiling, already in terrible pain.� Then, as the guards take hold of their levers
again and begin to stretch her, Audrey's voice returns in a horrible roar.

����������� &quot;Noooooooooo!!� I confe-e-e-ess!!!!&quot;

����������� Just
as I expected.� I smile.� &quot;You admit that you are a witch?&quot;

����������� &quot;Ye-e-es!&quot;

����������� &quot;And
you admit that dancing naked� in a
satanic ritual, and to keeping a familiar?&quot;

����������� &quot;Yes,
yes, yes!&quot;

����������� &quot;We
will ask you to sign a confession and ratify it when you are taken from this
place.� Will you do that of your own free
will?&quot;

����������� &quot;Oh
God, yes, yes!&quot;

����������� The
tears spill from her eyes, the sweat runs on her body.� Her very bones feel as if they are packed with
embers, as if she is burning from the inside, as if her spine has been hammered
through with nails.� She will think her
pelvis is tearing from her backbone, that her belly is ripping its moorings.� The truth cannot hide from such pain, and I
nod.

����������� &quot;We
shall show you mercy, now.&quot;

����������� As
the rollers release, Audrey's fingertips retreat visibly, slowly, her body
gradually contracting.� She gasps and
shrieks in a mixture of residual pain and almost-orgasmic relief.� Then come the tears; of course. She knows that
she has finally told the truth, she feels its burden lifted from her heart, and
knows that her sins can now be cleansed from her bones by the scourging fire.

����������� She
does not know, yet, that I have more questions. Questions she will be far more
reluctant to answer.

&nbsp;

����������� I
open the viewing-slot of Audrey's cell.�
It is almost pitch dark, the only light comes from a small oil-filled
lamp mounted on a bracket.� The walls are
roughly-hewn from the bedrock, featureless but for iron rings bolted four feet
off the floor.

����������� It
is to one such ring that Audrey is shackled.�
She slumps in the near-blackness, her arms held loosely over her head,
her head lolling against one arm.� It is
an exercise in despair; unslippable shackles inside an inescapable cell deep
within an impenetrable dungeon.� She
cannot even lower her arms to wipe the tears from her eyes.

����������� I
nod to the guards.� &quot;She is
ready.� Bring her.&quot;

����������� Five
minutes later, she is half-dragged into the orange light of the torture
chamber.� She struggles to get her legs
under her, but after her racking of a few days ago, her joints and muscles are
stiff and painful.� Her hands are again
manacled behind her back.

����������� &quot;I
see you are still a little sore,&quot; I note.

����������� Audrey's
blue eyes blaze with fear and anger as she regards me through strands of her
own black hair.� &quot;You have crippled
me,&quot; she accuses.

����������� &quot;That?� It's nothing.�
A few pulled muscles, a few torn ligaments, you'd recover, given the
chance.� Unless, of course, we put you back
on the rack.&quot;

����������� Audrey's
face grows pale.� &quot;What?� But - what have I done?� Please!�
I gave you my confession!&quot;

����������� &quot;And
now I want the rest.&quot;

����������� &quot;The
rest?&quot;� There is dread to the point
of nausea in her voice.

����������� &quot;People.� Places.�
You are a valuable source of information to us.&quot;

����������� &quot;I
don't know those things!&quot; Audrey squeals in horror.� &quot;Oh, God, you have to believe me - I
don't know!&quot;

����������� &quot;Do
you know Kathy Linyd?&quot;

����������� Audrey's
lips echo the name, and recognition flickers in her eyes.� &quot;I think I saw her name, somewhere ...
but ...&quot;

����������� &quot;She
was a witch, put to death only this weekend gone.� During her interrogation, she named you as
another witch, and one who would be able to answer our questions.&quot;

����������� The
tears begin to spill.� &quot;I don't
know, I don't know anything,&quot; she insists.

����������� At
my instruction, the guards place Audrey on a heavy frame of latticed iron
palings, almost like a garden trellis.�
She is shackled spreadeagled, her feet almost a yard-and-a-half apart,
her wrists similar; the chains then tightened by small turnscrews until she is
immovably stretched, reawakening the agonies of the rack.

The frame itself
is suspended at waist-height by four adjustable chains; by means of these, she
can be pitched and angled however I desire.�
I order her feet lowered, so that the base of the frame rests upon the
floor, her spread body on an angle.

She is already
shining with perspiration, her chest heaving quickly with fear; having been
tortured once before, she is dreading fresh pain.� I go and stand by the top of the frame,
behind her head, and close my fingers in her hair, raising her head up off the
frame.� &quot;Watch,&quot; I instruct.

The two guards
are already preparing.� A solid brazier
is stood barely five feet from the frame on which Audrey is bound.� Into this, burning coals are tipped, raising
a shower of sparks and smoke.� Then the
guards place a heavy black iron cauldron on the coals.

&quot;Do you
know what is in that pot?&quot; I ask.�
&quot;Oil. It will take an hour to heat properly, so I'll trust you to
watch it for us. When I return, we'll discuss that information you're holding
from me - and how I might persuade you to release it to me.&quot;

&quot;I beg you,
have mercy,&quot; Audrey gasps.� &quot;I
don't know anything!&quot;

&quot;You
will,&quot; I assure her.

The hour it
takes for the oil to heat is torture in itself.�
Not simply the physical anguish of being shackled, tightly-spread and
half-hanging, to the iron frame, but the psychological torment of knowing what
is coming.

I quietly
re-enter the torture chamber after forty minutes, and watch Audrey from a dark
corner:� Her eyes are fixed to the
brazier and its slowly-heating pot, her pupils dilated with fear. The heat from
the coals brings a sheen across her pale skin. As I watch, she twists her head
around to look up her own taut arm at the manacle fastened about her wrist; she
turns her hand within the cuff's snug fit, tries to reach her fingers to the
lock, as if she could somehow release it. Her feet tug and turn; the lineations
of muscle in her outstretched legs deepening with her struggles.

In front of her,
the oil in the cauldron pops with heat, and she freezes, eyes wide and
fixed again upon it. Then, with more fevered effort than ever, she renews her
struggles, the manacles clanking against the metal frame, her muscles shifting
and turning, her shining breasts rapidly heaving in the dungeon gloom.

I love to make a
dramatic entrance; and when I step from the shadows, Audrey is so terrified she
gives a high pitched squeak of anguish, jolting in her shackles. On cue, the
torture chamber door is unlocked and opened, and two guards and a scribe enter,
to witness and record the session.

Audrey Rose is
petrified. &quot;Please,&quot; she whimpers desperately. &quot;Please, I will
cooperate, I'll answer any questions you ask, I will do anything you say!� You don't need to torture me!&quot;

&quot;Raise her
feet,&quot; I order.

The guards move
to the chains, and draw them up so that the frame is lifted, and Audrey lies
flat on her back; but she lifts her head, watching in terror.� From the nearby table, I pick up the
insulated gloves, push my hand into the first. &quot;Where, then, is the Man In
Black?� Who are his associates?� Who else can you name?&quot;

&quot;Nobody, I
swear! �I don't know the man you speak of!� Oh God, I swear to you!&quot;� Audrey realizes that she cannot avoid
torture, and panic sweeps her.� She
thrashes in her manacles. Taking my time, I pick up the scoop for pouring
oil.� It is a metal ladle on a long stem,
but with its pouring spout forming a funnel to prevent splashing.

I can feel
savage heat radiating from the cauldron as I dip the scoop into it; there is an
evil crackle, moisture on the cold metal at once vaporized.� When I lift the scoop out, there is smoke
coming from its fiery contents, and I bring it over to where Audrey lies
spread.� I hold it over her bare left
foot.

&quot;Oh, God,
no, I beg you!&quot; she shrieks.

&quot;Where is
the Man In Black, Audrey?� Give me
names.&quot;

&quot;I swear, I
do not know these things,&quot; Audrey whispers.

I tip the
ladle.� A pencil-thin stream of smoking
oil pours over her toes; there is a hissing, crackling, like frying, and Audrey
jolts, rigid, her back arching, her breasts thrusting high as she screams in
agony.� The stream of oil flows between
her curled toes, burning rivulets down the sole and sides of her foot,
blue-grey smoke rising up where skin sears.�
Audrey's screams are terrible, the frame shaking as she struggles.

I stop pouring,
but as the last of the oil drips to the floor beneath her, Audrey still screams
and shouts, her foot smoking.� &quot;Oh,
Jesus Christ almighty, oh God ...&quot;

&quot;Names,
Audrey.&quot;� I pour a little more onto
her freshly-burned toes, the crackling oil spilling down her foot, and she
jolts and shrieks in agony again.� Her
pale skin is now red and ruined, blistered.�
As cruel as the pain, is the knowledge that her perfection will be
marred forever; but as a confessed witch, she has none of the protection from
scarring and maiming that the unconfessed might enjoy.

I hover the ladle
over her legs; Audrey watches it in horror and fear, the tears spilling from
her eyes.� The sweat clusters on her
breasts and torso and in her armpits like dewdrops, her body writhing endlessly
with the pain in her burned foot.�
Without any warning, I dribble oil onto her right shin, following the
line of the bone.� Audrey jolts and
screams, her mouth wide, her head back, her buttocks lifting off the frame as
smoke curls up from her leg.� Searing oil
streams down the sides of her calf, burning trails over her smooth skin.

����������� Her
scream ebbs into a long sighing wail, the tears and sweat running from her
face. She has stopped trying to free her wrists and ankles, finally resigned to
her helplessness, but that doesn't stop her writhing in agony.

����������� She
lifts her head to implore me piteously, &quot;please, I don't know what you
want!&quot;

����������� &quot;Pain
will sharpen your memory,&quot; I tell her.�
&quot;The Man in Black, Audrey.�
Where is he?� Who else can you
name as witches?&quot;

����������� Audrey
is gasping.� &quot;I don't know, I don't
know!� Who is the Man in Black, I have
never heard of him!&quot;

����������� I
bring the ladle close to her left thigh, and she gives a shriek; spread so
widely, she cannot move her legs, nor protect the hair-covered nest
between.� Almost casually, I dribble a
short stream of oil onto her inner thigh.�
It crackles and smokes along her skin, and she bucks wildly, giving a
terrible howl of agony.� The smell is
almost like frying pork.

����������� When
Audrey's screaming stops, I return to the cauldron.� I tip out the still-hot oil and stir the
seething liquid, drawing out a scoop of fresh oil.� It is still crackling in the dungeon air, and
I bring it over to Audrey, trailing smoke.

She is shaking
her head, begging me.� &quot;No, no more,
no more!&quot;

&quot;You're
holding out on me, Audrey Rose.� You are
protecting those who do not deserve to be protected.� Do you think they would endure all of
this, for you? Of course not.� They would
betray you in a heartbeat.&quot;

&quot;I protect
no-one,&quot; Audrey groans, her head thudding back onto the iron grate.

I bring the
ladle over her right arm, the taut interchange of muscle above her armpit, and
regard her coolly.� &quot;Names.� Places.&quot;

I tip the ladle,
and the superheated stream of oil pours onto her arm.� It hisses, sizzles; a smoking river searing down
her arm to her armpit, where it vaporizes her sweat and splashes me with hot
droplets. Audrey arches and bucks and screams in agony as steam and smoke curl
up from her sensitive skin, the oil flowing down her side. A large whitish
cloud climbs up into the vaulted ceiling.

����������� It
is a long time before Audrey stops screaming; when she does, she wails and
sobs, the oil still pooled in the hollow of her armpit, the skin blistered and
split, her flawless pale beauty now angry-red and scarred.

���������� &quot;Enough,&quot; she groans.� &quot;Please, I can take no more.&quot;

���������� &quot;There is still much I can
do,&quot; I tell her.� &quot;Tell me what
I need to know.&quot;

���������� &quot;I don't know it, oh please, I
don't know!&quot;

���������� I bring the ladle, still smoking, low
over her left breast.� Her head lifts to
stare at it, her eyes wide. �&quot;No,&quot;
she whispers.� &quot;No, I beg you!!&quot;

���������� &quot;Where is the Man in
Black?&quot;

���������� Audrey does not answer, but gives a
groan of dread and nausea, her head dropping back, so I pour. The burning oil
spills directly onto her rose-colored nipple, and the angry crackling of
burning skin is met by Audrey's most terrible screaming yet. As the oil spills
over the curve of her breast, her skin sears and burns, smoking trails scoring
her flesh in terrible rivers of agony, her nipple turning brown as I continue
to pour the oil over it.

���������� When I lift the ladle away, her
breast is smoking, steaming, and Audrey's head flings from side to side as she
screams in maddened agony.� Oil and sweat
still bubbles and crackles down her side to the iron frame on which she is
shackled.

���������� Her head rolls; and then her eyelids
flutter, and she falls into a swoon.

���������� &quot;Bring water,&quot; I call,
returning the ladle to the cauldron of oil.

A pail of icy well-water is fetched, and flung over Audrey's
spreadeagled body.� She awakens with a
groan, water running from her goosefleshed skin.� The angry red marks on her limbs and breast
show where the oil has burned her; blistered trails map its scorching retreat
across her naked flesh.

���������� Her ribcage heaves.

���������� &quot;It won't end, Audrey,&quot; I
say, when she has recovered enough to know her surroundings again.� &quot;It will never end until you give us
what we need.&quot;

���������� &quot;I don't know,&quot; she
sobs.� Her words are slurred; the shock
of her ordeal is affecting her, now.� I
have almost exhausted her, and she will need days of rest before I can resume.

���������� &quot;Think, Audrey.� You are a witch, you admitted it.� You must have known the Man In Black?&quot;

���������� &quot;I ... don't remember ...&quot;

���������� &quot;Why do you protect him?� He would betray you in an instant.&quot;

���������� Audrey begins to weep.� &quot;I don't know what you want me to
say!&quot;

���������� Again, I draw the ladle from the
cauldron.� Smoking oil drips from its
shimmering curve.� I can feel the
handle's heat, even through the thick gloves.�
Seeing it, Audrey is reanimated, weakly struggling in her shackles,
moaning in dread.

���������� &quot;Don't bring it, I beg you,
don't bring it!&quot; she begs.

���������� &quot;Talk to me, Audrey,&quot; I
warn, and hold the ladle low over her right breast.� A single hot drop of oil splats onto the bony
plateau between her breasts, and she wails and arches at the pain, a tiny
smoking brand.

���������� A moment later, I am pouring a fiery
cascade of burning oil over her right breast, and she gives voice to wild
screeches of agony.� The oil crackles and
spits where it spills over her nipple, tearing smoking streams of fire down the
curving flesh, to run down her ribcage, scorching a tiny path down the groove
of her belly to her navel.� Audrey
screams and howls; the curling steam stings my eyes as the
helplessly-spreadeagled witch rears and bucks her hips in pain, twisting in her
torment, trying to fling the pain from her body.� But the manacles about her wrists and ankles
hold her to the frame, hold her to the agony, the embrace of boiling oil
burning deep into her breast.

���������� Eventually, Audrey becomes still,
though her fists are clenched so tightly, the nails puncture her palms: her
dark ringed eyes roll dazedly.

&quot;I'll talk,&quot; she says weakly.�
&quot;Please, oh, God, please, I remember now.� No more!&quot;

&quot;I'm listening,&quot; I say patiently.� 

Audrey's chest heaves.� Her
spread body shines in sweat from head to toe.�
I am the same: my bare arms and shoulders are oiled with perspiration
from the heat.� Audrey's voice is hoarse
from screaming, but she gives what she knows:�
&quot;I remember � the Man in Black came to me in my sleep.&quot;� She rolls her head, moans in pain before
going on:� &quot;�He was in the form of a
bat, and flew in through my window � he ravished me in my bed.� Forgive me, I beg you � hurt me no more � I
do not know where he came from �&quot;

I slowly nod.� &quot;I believe
you, Witch.� And what of others?&quot;

&quot;I know nothing of others,&quot; Audrey says, in rising fear.

It does not save her: I tip a small dribble of oil in the crease of her
groin, at the very edge of her black pubic hair; the crackling hiss of burning
flesh is joined by her screams of agony, the hot oil trickling down between her
legs, scorching but not quite burning.

&quot;No!&quot; she shrieks, &quot;Stop!&quot;

I hover the ladle over her.�
&quot;It next falls where you fear it most,&quot; I warn.

&quot;Stop! I will give you names!&quot;

I slowly withdraw the ladle.�
&quot;Scribe?&quot; I call.�
&quot;Record this.&quot;

Audrey tells, the scribe writes.

When the session is done, Audrey's bruised wrists and ankles are freed.� She groans and is barely conscious as they
lift her from the frame, bind her hands behind her back, and carry her back to
her cell.� I thank my assistants, and
towel off my sweat-damp skin.

Audrey Rose has been broken.

���������� 

���������� I am the one to open her cell door,
but it is Steve who orders three of the eight hooded guards to fetch Audrey
Rose from where she slumps, arms chained over her head to the wall.� To see them, she gives a long cry of horror.

���������� &quot;No!� No, let me stay here, please!� Leave me here!&quot; she begs.� As they unshackle her wrists, and her arms
drop from the fetters, she weeps openly.�
Irons are closed again about her wrists, but only as cuffs securing them
behind her back, as she is lifted.

���������� The wounds on her body are cruel; her
burned foot, her burned legs and arm, her breasts; combined with the residual
swelling from her racking, she walks only with a great deal of difficulty, a
slow, hobbling limp.

���������� As they pass, I reach out to clear a
stray of lank and oily hair from Audrey's face, tucking it behind her ear.� &quot;It is almost over,&quot; I tell her
softly.

���������� As the guards, bearing Audrey, follow
Steve to the exit, I detour to my room and inspect the whips laid out
there.� The one I choose is heavy; and
woven into its tightly-braided bull hide are fine wires. Its kiss is truly
terrible, and it will be the instrument of Audrey's penultimate punishment.

���������� In my private thoughts, I had not
wanted to put Audrey to the lash. It had seemed to me pure sadism. But those
wiser than I had spoken of the necessity of it; only through making the
execution a spectacle can we avoid complacency among those whose everyday
freedoms are so threatened by witchcraft.

So the whip shall fall upon Audrey's flesh. I clutch the hard coils
close to my body, pulling my heavy cloak around me, and follow the somber
procession.

���������� When Audrey is led outdoors, there is
a roar from the crowd. Talk has been strong about the growing plague, and the
people are alarmed by it. Today they want proof that the Witchseekers can do
their job. Today they want to see a witch burn to death, and they want her
agony to be felt by all who are, or would become, a witch.

���������� Audrey hobbles terribly. It is a
miserable day, dark clouds and a cold breeze; those come to watch the execution
are in coats and jackets.� It is a twist
of irony that Audrey is naked, and that goosebumps coarsen her skin, that her scarred
and swollen nipples crinkle and stand in the chill.� She will find warmth soon enough.

���������� The first stop on the way to the
stake is the scaffold, at the top of which stands the whipping frame, a tall
rectangle of wood with manacles dangling open; the chains have already been
adjusted to Audrey's height.� The crowd
surges around the scaffold, pressing from all four sides, and the guards have
to fight to clear a path for Audrey as she is led to the broad steps that lead
up.

���������� &quot;You're going to suffer,
witch!&quot;

���������� &quot;You want a fuck before you
die?&quot;

���������� &quot;They should tear your tongue
out and break your bones, you whore!&quot;

���������� The shouts are neither eloquent nor
constructive, a generic roar of abuse and taunting from the throngs who jostle
for a view.� But it expresses the rage
that has built up, and Audrey flinches repeatedly from the cries, her eyes not
daring to meet the twisted faces of those who want to see her in flames.

From behind the procession, I regard the scaffold with some reluctance;
the last person to suffer up there, naked and shrieking, was me.� Now is my chance to extract some kind of
vengeance for my humiliation.

���������� Audrey has to be helped up the stairs
by four of the guards.� Despite her
weeping, she is too weak from torture to offer resistance as her arms are
stretched up to the cuffs that dangle open and icy in the afternoon's
chill.� The iron is made fast about her
wrists, and it is almost with relief that she slumps into a hang, her legs limp
beneath her.

���������� &quot;Goddamn, she's a fox!&quot; someone
shrieks, and there is laughter.� Digital
cameras are lifted above the heads of the crowd, people angling for the best
shot. A flash goes off.

���������� I climb the steps as the guards descend,
and, at the top, shed my cloak. God, I deliberated for ages over what to wear
today. Not too casual, not too formal. The red cocktail dress was just too
dressy. The track pants and t-shirt were too 'gym mom.'� The long black skirt and long-sleeved top
made me look like a witch myself, and the polka-dot sundress was altogether too
flippant.

���������� The dark blue silk camisole and black
bootleg pants, I feel, are ideal. No restriction of movement, not too formal
nor too casual, and just the right color for a whipping. It was obviously a
good choice: there's a wolf-whistle from somewhere below.

� Although it might be for Audrey.� She certainly does look beautiful.� I am always perplexed by the way a witch
looks so lovely on her execution-day, in much the same way that all brides are
beautiful. For all the marring of her beautiful white skin, she is still
slender and graceful and sexy.

���������� At last, there is the semblance of a
hush from the crowd below us. Oberon climbs the scaffold, briefly consults his
notes, then raises his voice to address those gathered.

���������� &quot;Before you is the confessed
witch, Audrey Rose.� Named by the witch
Katherine Linyd, who was executed last week, Rose was arrested in England on
July the 14th by one of our finest Witchseekers, the same man who will be entrusted
with burning her today. She was locked in iron and brought back here to face
interrogation. She was tortured only for the extraction of truth, and she duly
gave it.&quot;

���������� I wish he'd hurry up.� My arms and shoulders are bare and I'm
getting cold.

���������� &quot;Audrey Rose is charged with
dancing naked and performing lewd acts beneath a full moon; and to this, she
has confessed. Audrey Rose is charged with reciting spells and satanic
incantations; and to this, she has confessed. Audrey Rose is charged with keeping
a familiar; and to this, she has confessed. Audrey Rose is charged with
witchcraft, and of being a witch; and to this, she has confessed.&quot;

���������� There is a cheer at that news, in
anticipation of the announcement to come.�
And it duly does: &quot;For this, the witch, Audrey Rose, is sentenced
to thirty lashes of the whip, and then to be burned alive at the stake.&quot;

���������� The crowd gives a huge cheer, and as
Oberon steps down, it is my signal.� I
uncurl the whip in my hand, and its length slaps across the platform. God,
stage fright! How many did they say?�
Twelve hundred people?

Feet apart, I draw back my arm, then fling the whip forward with all
the precision and skill my father passed on to me: the braided leather whistles
through the air, and cracks! across Audrey's naked back with a sound
like snapping wood; she is flung forward in the chains, the air driven from her
lungs with a shriek, and instantly there is a visible score� across her shoulder blades.� The pain arrives an instant later, and Audrey
gives a long wail.

The crowd loves it.� I fling the
whip again, crossing the first lash, then a third time, then a fourth; quickly
laying a bloody crosshatch over Audrey's pale skin as she barks and shrieks in
pain.� The sweat has sprung across her
body, her ribcage is heaving.� 

The next lash cracks across her lower back, just above her buttocks;
she lurches against the chains, and screams.�
I cross it with two more stripes, until a trickle of blood runs between
the cheeks of her arse. Another stroke, across her middle-back, and her shriek
echoes off the chateau wall. Some in the crowd are counting the lashes, and the
crack! of the ninth and tenth lashes are eagerly tallied. A spot of warm
blood hits my arm.

I pause.� I am already breathing
hard, putting all of my strength into the whipping.� Dangling as she is by her wrists from the
open frame, Audrey is as exposed in front as she is behind; many of those
present have crowded in front of her to catch the best view of her nakedness,
and to see the pain on her face as each whip-stroke lands.� Now, I circle to stand in front of her, and
regard her half-hanging form.� The
blistered marks of torture are still clear to see, both breasts scorched and now
swollen.� I casually wonder if there is
much feeling left in them - then measure the distance with my eyes, and fling
the whip.

The impact
throws her breasts upwards and leaves an instant welt across both, drawing a
terrible cry from Audrey's lips.� She
feels it.� Blood appears along the
wound, and a moment later another stroke lands across her breasts. Then
another, then another; the fourteenth lash lands straight across the apex of
her breasts, and spots of blood fleck her skin as one tortured nipple is
cracked open.� Her shrieks are piteous,
but the crowd roars in approval.

I lay another
lash across her breasts, fascinated by the way they jiggle with the heavy
whip's power; now they are messed with cris-crossing lines.� The whip's tip has sliced across one armpit.

Audrey's head
tips back and she bellows in pain at the leaden sky.� I don't pause, but throw the whip again, this
time snapping it across her taut belly.�
Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen; the strokes are etched in welts
across her flesh.� The twentieth lash
stripes low across her belly, all but parting her pubic hair, and she swings
from the shackles, wailing in pain.

I aim the lash
lower now; slicing across her upper thighs, then across her hips, a bloody
stripe angling across her loins.� Her
head hangs low between her pain-racked arms as she dangles from the manacles,
howling, a string of saliva hanging from her open mouth.

I circle her
again, and slash out with the whip from behind her once more; it catches the
backs of her thighs, wraps itself around her hip, and she lifts her legs clear
off the platform in a spasm of agony, almost wrenching her already-pained
shoulders out of joint.� It doesn't
protect her, though, as the next swipes crack! across the top of her
buttocks, leaving two angry lines.

&quot;Twenty
six!&quot; the crowd shouts en masse, as the whip slices again across the
back of Audrey Rose's shoulders; back again, across the shoulder blades, then
across her lower back, where the bite of the whip is most terrible.� Audrey's head flings back in a spray of sweat
and she screams up at the wooden crossbar from which she hangs.

I thrash her
twice more, until the small of her back is in ribbons.� The whip finally slithers back across the
scaffold wood, leaving a smear of blood.�
There are spots of blood on my arms and camisole, too. Audrey hangs
panting and moaning. Red-tainted sweat creeps in rivulets down her tortured
body, her black hair clings to her sweaty shoulders.

It is done.

I carefully use
a cloth to wipe Audrey's sweat and blood from the whip, coiling it up, as the
guards ascend to the platform.� In
anticipation, the crowd is surging like a tide towards the stake, fifty yards
away; while Audrey is released from the manacles.� She sags between the guards, who will now
have to all but carry her to her death.

&nbsp;

Audrey's entire
body must be in agony from the whipping, but she still finds the strength to
struggle and shout as they drag her up over the woodpile to the stake.� It stands no more than nine feet tall; the
wood pile is barely two feet.

As two guards
pin her against the post, a third draws her arms behind it; her wrists are
lashed together with thick rope. Her ankles are then bound together. She is
secured, her naked, scarred body displayed to the huge crowd.

From my vantage point, I watch her as I have watched many before
her.� Her head is lifted, but her eyes
seem not to see the crowds; her face seems melancholy, oddly relaxed, and I
wonder what she is thinking.� Perhaps her
mind is back in the forest where she had lived; the damp earth beneath her
feet, the summer dawn slanting through the trees.� She must know she will never know that
freedom again, that these are her final minutes?

The Witchseeker I know only as Steve is clutching a flaming torch, and
with a flourish, he lays it in the straw at the very edge of the woodpile. The
wood and straw has been laid with skill, and the flames fan and spread out
around the edges of the pile first, quickly encircling the witch at its centre.
With his hands, Steve encourages more shouting from the crowd; a sea of angry
fists pounding the air towards the bound witch, a chanted scream from a
thousand voices: �Burn! Burn!� Burn!�
Burn!

The first wisps of smoke drag Audrey from her trance, and the naked
woman finally acknowledges the flames that flutter and snap all around her,
only two yards distant.� A look of abject
terror fills her face, she presses her head back against the stake, her lips
trembling, repeating some inward mantra.�
In front of a thousand onlookers, she pees herself, her fear streaming
down the insides of her thighs, and bursts into tears.

Some witches thrash and struggle and plead; Audrey Rose is beyond that.
She knows she is helpless.� She knows she
will die.� I can see her body shaking; if
it wasn't for the ropes holding her arms tightly about the stake, she would
simply collapse from fear.� The sweat is
running with the tears on her pretty face.

Mustering courage, she turns her gaze again to the flames. They are
higher, now; reaching for her, flickering into the air, grasping and clambering
upwards through the wood towards her bare legs. Sparks drift upwards on the
currents of air and sting her naked flesh, and she gives a wail at their
piercing touch.

Her terrified eyes now search the sea of shouting faces, imploring,
afraid, so terribly alone behind the flames. The woodpile itself is like a
barrier; outside it, the living; within it, the dead. It is only a matter of
time.

A clump of dry leaves and straw flare brightly, and the heat scorches
Audrey's skin; she gives another wail and turns her face from the fire. She
squeezes her eyes shut; then, on opening them, finds herself staring directly
at me.� I give no hint that I am either
enjoying the spectacle, or upset by it, but it makes no difference. She calls
the words, Kirsten!� Please kill me!
- although I can't hear her over the noise of the crowd. I simply shake my
head, and she looks away with another cry of fear and misery.

�The flames are jumping high,
now, although still a yard from her. Their searing heat is singeing the downy
hairs on her naked skin, causing her ever greater discomfort.� Automatically, she begins shifting in her
bonds, trying to avoid the pain, but it is all around her.� Her black hair is shifting, stirring as the
hot air funnels up around her.

A flame almost touches her bare thigh; Audrey yelps, writhes; I can see
her trying to work her arms free, tugging her wrists in their bonds.� But she is held in place as the fire jumps
again, flame wrapping around her left hip for a moment.� She screams at its touch, flinging her face
away, and the crowd cheers delight.

Fire attacks from the right, now; orange flames like razors, licking at
her calf, tearing the skin, flaying her with its touch, and Audrey roars again
in pain. She is gibbering to the sky, begging for death, for release, for
anything other than this; but the fire has tasted her, and it is hungry for
more.

More fire skitters up the back of her right leg; flames leap at her
left, suddenly, it is all around her, her legs are blistering, smoking, and
Audrey's screams are terrible.� Bound
against the stake, she can do nothing but writhe and shake her head and howl as
the fire eats into her. This is the terrible price she pays for being a witch;
a hideous death, without dignity, the intimacy of her final hour watched by
over a thousand spectators.

Her black pubic hair crackles and flares brightly, and flames, that
have funnelled up behind her legs, spurt out between them, licking up around
her blistering pubic mound. As her vulva and anus are burned, she screams and
screams, insane with the agony of it.�
Flames cup her buttocks and flutter in the small of her back, the blood
and sweat of her whipping sizzling away.�
The ropes on her wrists are smoldering, now, but they will not burn
through in time to free her.

Audrey's long hair begins to char and frizz, but, screaming, she keeps
her face skyward, preserving its beauty, even as flames lick up her flat
stomach, blistering her already-tortured breasts.� Now that her voice is driven by agony, I can
hear her; she is begging to God to release her from this horror.

The fire surges and jumps upwards; now around her breasts, her ravaged
nipples, licking up the stake behind her and tearing the skin from her
back.� Her hands are on fire behind the
wooden post.� Her legs are burning, melting.

I have seen enough.� She will die
soon enough; her screams follow me as I work my way to the edge of the
crowd.� Looking back, I see only the
plume of smoke rising up from her burning body, hearing the chanting of the
crowd, the whistles of appreciation, seeing the flashes of cameras.

Audrey Rose had to die; I only hope that by her suffering, others are
deterred.

Part 4 - Bubba

&nbsp;

����������� It is not often I
have a man to work on in my torture chamber.

����������� I must have shown
my enthusiasm.� A black backless gown
with a plunging neckline and split sides, teamed with strappy sandals and a
gold serpent coiled around my upper left arm - that's trying a little too hard to
impress.

����������� As it is, of
course, Bubba barely notices me.� He is
brought in with hands locked in shackles behind his back, barefoot in jeans and
tee-shirt, a guard on each arm and two more behind.� He tries to hide his fear as he looks around
the vaulted depths of the torture chamber; but the flickering lights illuminate
countless ghastly instruments, and I can see he is afraid.

����������� He is a handsome
man, a Burt Reynolds type with dark hair and full moustache, dark eyebrows, his
mixed white and Cherokee ancestry a delicious combination. It almost seems a
shame to strip this man of his beauty and dignity, but it is my job.

����������� &quot;You have
willingly submitted to being put to the question,&quot; I say, and his
dark-blue eyes lock on to me, somewhere about breast-level. Subtle. &quot;Just
because you are a willing victim, don't think we'll go easy on you.� We can put you through some horrible tortures
indeed. The truth must be forced from you.&quot;

����������� Bubba swallows; I
see the shift of his adam's apple, and his eyes finally meet mine. &quot;Just
get on with it,&quot; he says.

����������� &quot;Strip
him,&quot; I order.

����������� The guards are
not gentle; they wrench his trousers and underpants down, and physically tear
the tee-shirt from his body; the garments are then heaped onto a brazier, where
they smoulder and then burst into flames. Bubba watches with dismay; it is a
reminder that, here, he is to be denied any of the comforts and modesties of
civilised life.

����������� &quot;What do we
think about this one, Kirsten?&quot; It is Tina, my superior; she doesn't want
to miss this, and she steps forward from the shadows, smiling with
anticipation.� 

����������� Bubba towers over
us both, approaching six-four, long-limbed and lean.� Standing naked, it's hard to miss the light
tan of his skin, the fuzz of hair across his broad chest.� Tina notes, &quot;he seems cute.&quot;

����������� &quot;Now, Tina,
it would be unprofessional to let pleasure interfere with business,&quot; I
remind her.� She glances at me.

����������� &quot;So why did you dress up?
Going to a party?&quot; She, sensibly, has dressed for the chill of the
dungeons in moleskin trousers and a thick woollen sweater.� I bite my lip.

&quot;I just thought I'd � dress
to �&quot; I can't think of an excuse, and Tina laughs.

����������� &quot;Well, we'd
better get on with it,&quot; she says.

����������� I nod.
&quot;Prepare him.&quot;

����������� The guards
wrestle Bubba over to an open space between the torture chamber's gothic brick
pillars.

I was obliged to refit the
suspension chain with larger manacles; those normally used are too narrow for
this warlock's wrists. He is locked in the iron, wrists before his body, and I
check personally that the shackles are secure before ordering the windlass
turned. Bubba's muscular arms are drawn upwards by the fetters, baring the dark
pockets of hair beneath his arms, inflating his chest, drawing up the arch of
his ribcage, until his body stands stretched on tip-toes.

����������� I look up into
his eyes. They show trepidation, uncertainty. Already, he regrets turning
himself over for examination -� and it
has not even started! There is a tension between us; I know that, freed, he
could kill me with his bare hands, and I would be helpless against his strength.
But here, I hold all the power. He fears me, but I can see that he desires me
with equal intensity. He would most likely rape me before he killed me � and
would perhaps even fuck my corpse to shame me in death as well.

����������� &quot;Raise
him,&quot; I order my guards.

����������� The crank turns,
and Bubba gives a groan as, by the manacled wrists, he is hoisted off the
floor. He is raised until his toes search the air four inches from the slimy
flagstones. The winch is locked. The pain is evident on his face, the iron
manacles biting hard into the bones of his wrists.

����������� &quot;I won't
confess,&quot; he gasps. &quot;I am repentant.&quot;

����������� &quot;I haven't
tortured you yet,&quot; I say in reply. &quot;Savour this, Warlock, because it
is sheer comfort compared to what awaits you.&quot;

����������� From the warmth
and comfort of my room by the torture chamber, I watch Bubba on a surveillance
monitor. Unaware that he is under constant scrutiny, the dangling prisoner
spends his first hour of suspension as they all do; desperate to get down.
After all, it hurts badly. He swings his long legs, and reaches out with his
feet, trying to discover some platform or object on which he might support his
weight; but he is inches from the floor, and three yards from the nearest stone
pillar. There is nothing.

����������� Then he looks up
at the manacles, the chain from which he slowly swings: it reaches four feet to
its pulley, a height he could not hope to scale, even if there were any means
to free himself at the top.

����������� After an hour,
his naked skin is glossed with a sheen of sweat.� He still struggles, but now it is against the
pain.� His feet stir endlessly, his head
shifts forward and back, his hips twist. It hurts in his wrists; but now he is
beginning to feel a burning pain in his arms as well. He can only hold that pain
off by tensing his muscles and absorbing as much of his weight as he can ...
but he knows, as I know, that it can only be temporary.

����������� Over the second
hour, his strength drains. I can see it.

����������� Sure, he's a
powerful man; but for all his strength, his size works against him. I have seen
women hold out for three hours or more, but after two, Bubba has exhausted his
arms and now, finally, hangs limply.

����������� The tendons and
ligaments in his arms and shoulders are on fire.� It is like being on the rack.� His full weight is held by fibres that aren't
made for that kind of load, and they are reacting by painful protest.� Now, it is only Bubba's feet that stir and
turn, his face contorted with pain.

����������� I go for dinner.

����������� It is almost four
hours since he was hoisted, when I return to my monitor.� He has had no relief, no visitor, nothing in
all that time; now he hangs motionless, his head down, his body wet with sweat.� He would appear unconscious, but I know he is
wide awake and aware of every shard of pain spearing through his shoulders and
arms.

����������� I smile in
satisfaction, and switch off the computer.�
Still another eight hours until I have Bubba lowered from his
suspension, so I may as well get some sleep.

����������� 

����������� I'm dressed a
little more sensibly for my second day with Bubba.

����������� Only just.

����������� A too-small
spaghetti-strap top, a pleated tartan miniskirt and calf-length boots with
heels - I thought I glimpsed a wannabe-schoolgirl in the mirror as I left, but
dammit, I've got to play the game to the max.�
It's humiliation; no man likes to be at the mercy of a sexy girl.� Even if she is on the uphill
side of thirty-five.

����������� I think I'm
distracting the guards; they're more eager than usual, almost stepping on my
heels as we stride into the torture chamber, towards the limp, gleaming figure
dangling mid-air from the manacles.

����������� &quot;I'm
guessing you didn't have a comfortable night,&quot; I say, as we near.

����������� Bubba's head
lifts, his feet shift, he groans.� From
the weariness on his face, hanging has been a thousand times worse than he ever
imagined it would be.� &quot;Please, let
me down!&quot;

����������� &quot;Well, now,
I'll be happy to do that,&quot; I say, &quot;but first I have to ask if you'll
reconsider your position. All of this posturing, claiming that you're a reformed
warlock, that you're following the 'right path,' between you and me, it's all
bullshit, isn't it?&quot;

����������� &quot;Please � I
am not a warlock any more,&quot; he groans.

����������� &quot;Oh, come
now!&quot; I put my hand out to the hard wall of his taut belly, a slow
downwards caress of the firm, warm muscle; then push. Like a carcass of meat,
Bubba swings back on the chain, then slowly forward, the iron creaking and
grating.� He winces against the shifting
stresses in his tortured arms. &quot;You'll need to do better than that, to
convince me!&quot; I glance at the guards. &quot;Bring him down, prepare the
water torture.&quot;

����������� Exhausted from a
night hanging, Bubba has barely the energy to struggle, as he is dragged over
to a simple ladder-type rack, angled off the floor.� Held down on it by three guards, he cannot
escape as the fourth guard manacles his wrists to the uppermost rung.� His ankles are tied together and roped to the
winch at the rack's lower end.

����������� The guards step
back, their prisoner restrained; but one takes the long lever of the winch, and
carefully begins to turn it.� The ratchet
clicks, and Bubba's muscled frame is pulled, gradually straighter, longer,
until he is drawn into an uncomfortable stretch.� His ribcage is lifted, his belly hollowed,
his arms and thighs taut and defined with the strain. �I put a hand to his chest to check the
tension, feeling the strong thud of his heart beneath the fuzz of hair.

����������� &quot;Three
notches more,&quot; I order.

����������� The ropes squeal,
the ladder-rack creaks, and Bubba gives a groan as his already-tormented arms
are again put under stress.� I nod in
satisfaction. &quot;Now the mask.&quot;

����������� It is made of
leather, resembling a featureless muzzle but for a single round hole.� Bubba�s nostrils are first plugged with wads
of warmed wax; then the mask is stretched over his face, leaving only his
panicked eyes uncovered.� The closeness
and heaviness of the mask brings on feelings of suffocation,
claustrophobia.� Only the hole over his
mouth, allows breath; his nose is sealed and the mask prevents him from blowing
out the wax plugs. The guards lift his head so the mask can be buckled tightly
in place.

����������� For the second
time, I put my hand to his chest.� Now, I
trail my fingertips downwards, over the corrugations of his ribcage, then
across the hard-pillowed landscape of his abominals. He knows where my hand is
going, and even with the mask strapped on, he lifts his head to see.

����������� Is he aroused,
despite his predicament? Could that be possible? I imagine his gaze travelling
down my exposed neck, my bare shoulders and downy skin; exploring the shape of
me, the way my tank-top hugs my bra-less breasts, the way my nipples poke bumps
in the thin cotton.� I imagine him
watching the way my tiny skirt flirts with my thighs.

����������� As my hand closes
around his cock, his head falls back and he exhales.� It must be fear but it almost seems like
arousal. He doesn't see, then, the rubber band in my other hand, but as soon as
I snap it over his cock, doubling it so that it painfully constricts his
flaccid manhood, he cries out.

����������� &quot;Oh god,
take it off, please!&quot;

����������� There's more to
come.� As Bubba lies pleading for the
band to be taken off his penis, I retrieve one more implement, then, standing
alongside his chest,� I press my hand
over the mouth-hole of the leather mask on his face, sealing it shut, silencing
his voice in an instant.

Bubba's eyes fly wide.� I watch his belly shift as he tries to draw
breath; I feel the suction on my palm.�
He tries to twist his head away from under my hand, but it is useless.

����������� Long seconds
pass.� My hand stays in place.

����������� His heart is
pounding.� His lungs want air, and he is
trying without success to breathe.� I
have been counting in my head; one minute.�
In another thirty seconds, he will be at the point of utter panic,
that moment when a drowning man finally tries to breathe water into his lungs
and the agony of death begins.

����������� I wait.

����������� Bubba is
writhing, struggling for air, his eyes wild, filled with horror and pleading.
He truly believes I am killing him, suffocating him with nothing more than the
touch of my palm, I can see it in his eyes.

����������� I remove my hand.

����������� Behind the mask's
small hole, the warlock's mouth opens wide, and he gasps air in a huge inward
whoop.� At the same instant, I bring up a
metal funnel I have been holding, and shove it down into the hole.� It slides cleanly into Bubba's open mouth,
over his tongue, all the way to the back of his throat.� Bubba makes an awful sound, his body heaves
as he gags and retches, trying to eject the funnel, but I am already fastening
it into place with a simple pair of dome-catches.� Finally, with a hollow, megaphone sound,
Bubba begins to breathe, fast and ragged, through the funnel, as if it's a
snorkel.� His eyes show every bit of his
dread, as he realises the true horror of his situation.

����������� I step back and
look at him.� His tall body is stretched
taut, utterly helpless.� His skin gleams
with perspiration. His limbs are taut and hard, straining, the veins
stark.� Amidst the dark fuzz of his
chest, his nipples poke up into the chill dungeon air, inviting the grip of
pliers or the snip of shears. His cock is already looking blue, strangled by
the rubber band tight around its base.

����������� Two of the guards
have brought water; four large pails of it, and a scoop.� The scoop holds one pint.� Slowly, taking up the scoop, I dip it in the
first bucket and hold it over Bubba's naked chest.� Drops of water splat onto his skin, and he
flinches.

����������� &quot;Understand
how this works, Warlock,&quot; I say carefully.�
&quot;I tip the water into that funnel in your mouth.� You swallow it, or you drown.� It's your choice.&quot;

����������� Bubba tries to
shake his head no! but I tip the water into the funnel.� It gurgles down the spout, quickly fills to
the brim.� For a few seconds, Bubba does
nothing.� But he can't breathe. I can see
him fighting not to panic; his arms are straining against the tension of the
rack, but he can't get free.

����������� Briefly, there is
a burst and a gurgle from the funnel; he is trying to blow the water out, but
there's too much; he simply loses precious breath.� I calmly dip the scoop again, and refill the
funnel to the brim.

����������� The veins on
Bubba's forehead begin to stand out.� He
knows he has no choice.� Then, finally,
he begins to swallow it.� Glug, glug,
glug � the water level subsides as he swallows it down, with increasing
desperation.� He needs to breathe.

����������� I wait until he
has almost swallowed all the water, then dip the scoop again and refill the
funnel.� Bubba's eyes almost burst from
his head in horror. He still hasn't breathed; his chest is spasming for air,
his stomach heaves.� Without hesitation,
now, he gulps the water as fast as he can, taking it down.� Finally, it is gone, and he heaves precious
air through the funnel.

����������� I let him breathe
for ten seconds, his chest and belly rocking up and down.� Then I refill the scoop.

����������� &quot;Uhhhhh,&quot; is all Bubba
can say through the funnel, trying to shake his head between his
tautly-upstretched arms, but I pour the third pint in regardless. This time,
there is no hesitation. He swallows, swallows, swallows it down, fast and
frantic gulps.� Even before it is empty,
I fill the scoop again, pour it into the funnel.

����������� Bubba drinks.

����������� Four pints, now.
Bubba coughs through the funnel, breathing hard. I can see already that his
stomach is distended. He will be hurting. The torture has begun. I fill the
scoop once again, but this time, I dribble a little at a time into the funnel.
As the water hits the back of his throat, he is forced to swallow it, despite
the cramping pain in his stomach. I gaze into his eyes as I pour, wanting him
to understand the complete control I have over him. I decide whether he
breathes, or drowns. I decide how long he can have between breaths, I decide
how many breaths he can have.

����������� When he has
finally taken the fifth pint, I take a break. Judging from the groans coming
from the funnel, Bubba is in a lot of pain already. His stomach feels like it
is about to burst. Already the water is quickly filtering through his system,
and things are only going to get worse.

����������� Fifteen minutes,
then I fill the scoop again and, ignoring Bubba's frantic hootings, pour the
water into the funnel. Again, he swallows it down; more reflex than conscious
act. When this latest pint of water has gurgled down the funnel, Bubba gives a
groan.

����������� Another fifteen
minutes, another pint.

����������� Then another
fifteen minutes, and yet another pint.

����������� A little more
than an hour after starting the torture, Bubba looks as if he's pregnant. His
belly is bloated and taut, adding strain to his already-stretched body. Every
minute or so a knot of cramp hits his stomach, and he visibly tenses, his eyes
screwing up with the pain. Everything is distended, stretched by the volume of
water inside him.

����������� I dip the scoop,
and dribble a little more every half minute, and Bubba obediently swallows it.
I can almost hear his innards creaking as they stretch and cramp. His bladder,
too, is rapidly expanding; but with the rubber band around his penis, he can't
release it.

When the latest scoopful has
gone, the warlock lies groaning. The sweat has broken out across his body. He
is truly in pain, now. I stand, looking down at him.� &quot;Confess that you still practise
witchcraft.� Confess that you are
involved in the black arts.� Confess that
you have tried to deceive the Witchseekers.&quot;

����������� His eyes squeeze
shut. He cannot bring himself to shake his head and deny confession, but he will
not nod yes.

����������� &quot;Christ,
this is getting boring,&quot; one of the guards complains. &quot;He'll never confess!&quot;� I turn, to send him an icy glare.

����������� &quot;Don't
underestimate this technique,&quot; I growl. &quot;You're all dismissed, for
now; but if you want to see something spectacular, come back in two
hours.&quot;

����������� The guards
depart.

����������� It takes
patience; scoop after scoop of water, dribbled into the funnel; and when the
guards return, Bubba is screaming.

����������� Not just groans,
but full screams of pain. His belly his horribly expanded, his bladder too; his
wrists and ankles are bleeding from his desperate attempts to get free.� His innards, distended and stretched by the
water, hurt as if somebody was performing surgery without anaesthetic.

����������� Repeatedly he
throws up; water gurgles from his throat, up into the funnel; he's forced to
swallow it again before he can breathe, but in that time, the sheer panic of
suffocation and near-drowning take him again to the edge of sanity.

����������� Water is seeping
as sweat from every pore; but it leeches vital salts from his muscles as it
does, and under the tension of the rack, the cramps are excruciating.� Another scream echoes through the torture
chamber. His stretched body is shaking violently. Tears stream from his eyes.

����������� But I am about to
make it even worse.� I approach the table
holding a cane, a yard long, the thickness of my index finger. I swish it idly
through the air; it makes a delicious whistling sound.

����������� &quot;Remove the
mask,&quot; I say.

����������� Bubba's head is
wrenched up, the leather face-mask unbuckled.�
It is pulled away, the long stem of the funnel is drawn from his throat,
and Bubba heaves a small amount of water out.�
They head his head drop, and he gives a long wail of agony.

&quot;You've had time to think
upon your confession,&quot; I say. &quot;Give it now, and you will receive
mercy.&quot;

����������� &quot;Stop the
pain,&quot; he begs.

����������� &quot;Do you
confess?&quot;

����������� &quot;Please, my
Lady, please! I swear, I am an innocent man!&quot;

����������� Without any
further questions, I lift my arm and slash down with the cane; it gives a
shrill whistle and then thwacks!! across Bubba's distended belly.
It is like hitting a drum, the shockwave brutalising his distended organs, and
he gives a terrible scream of agony.� 

����������� I thrash his
belly again, then again; the blows are hard and cruel, each one laying a savage
red welt across his shining-tight skin.�
He bellows in pain.� I pause, then
strike him twice again; slashing across his stomach, then higher, the cane
smashing down onto one nipple and making his body bounce up off the ladder-rack
despite the tension.

����������� Bubba throws up
more water, chokes and coughs, his screams replaced by desperate splutters and
whoops for air.� I gauge the distance
again, and slice down hard with the cane, just above his pubic hair.� The impact finds his bladder, agony exploding
through his abdomen with the intensity of electric shocks. The pain knocks the
air out of him, and he simply lies, stretched, his mouth wide open, incapable
of sound.

����������� So I slice down
again with the cane one more time across his belly.� The shock of impact brings a new scream from
Bubba's throat that takes a long time to ebb.

The marks of the cane are raised
welts on his flesh.� His bloated abdomen
is already changing colour where it has struck him; he looks ready to burst
open.� His cock pokes up at a strange
angle, blue now, with the rubber band still around the base.

I grasp Bubba's face and turn it
so that he is forced to look at me, his eyes dark with suffering, the tears
mixing with sweat. &quot;Confess.�
Confess and it ends.&quot;

&quot;Oh, God, please,&quot; he
whimpers.� &quot;You have to let me piss,
I beg you, I beg you!&quot;

The guards, behind me, chuckle.
If they only knew the intensity of pain Bubba is experiencing. The warlock is
oblivious to their amusement, his eyes pleading me.

&quot;Confess and I'll take it
off,&quot; I say.

&quot;You're breaking an innocent
man,&quot; Bubba sobs.

&quot;You lie!&quot; I shout, and
swing the cane down hard towards the base of the rack.� Its end slices across the knuckles of his
toes with a sound like a firecracker, and Bubba jolts, then lets out a long
howl of pain.� I shout &quot;put the mask
back on him!&quot;

&quot;No, no, oh for pity's sake,
nooo!&quot;
Bubba
squeals in terror.� The guards wrestle
with his head, lifting the rack and putting the mask around his face.� Bubba is begging; he is in more agony than he
can bear, and terrified beyond words at the thought of more torture.

The leather is buckled securely,
the funnel is brought.� Bubba clamps his
mouth shut, but I change that quickly.�
Another swishing blow of the cane to the ends of his toes, and he
screams out in pain; the stem of the funnel is shoved deep into his mouth.

He sees me filling the scoop with
water, and his voice trumpets whimpers of terror through the funnel.� They're quickly stifled, though, when I pour
the water in, and his belly rocks and heaves as he is forced to swallow it
down.� The resulting spasms and cramps
through his stomach feel like a knife has sliced through it, and he is barely
able to choke down the last of the water.�
When it's all swallowed, he can't even scream; the moans I hear are
those of a man barely able to catch breath.

I fill the scoop again.� Bubba's eyes are losing focus, but I hover
the scoop above the rim of the funnel, letting a small splash land in his
throat.� He coughs, swallows.

&quot;One more chance,
Warlock.� Confess.&quot;

He does not reply.� Perhaps he can't.� I pour the water anyway.� The funnel fills to the brim; the water glugs
lazily as Bubba swallows once, twice, three times; and then, no more. He is
struggling to take the water down his throat, but his body won't respond.� Instead, he is quietly drowning, the funnel
still half-full.

I glance over his body. The sheen
of perspiration, the stretched and straining muscles, the obscenely-swollen
belly, his strangled cock. He has somehow managed to hold out; but this is only
the first day.

I shake my head. &quot;We're
finished for now.� Let him breathe.&quot;
Still swinging the cane, I walk from the rack.�
As an afterthought I call back, &quot;oh, and take that rubber band off
his dick before his bladder bursts � but stand back!&quot;

Judging from the guards'
reactions a minute later, it's quite a geyser.

&nbsp;

����������� He spends the
next few days chained in his cell.� It
takes a while to recover from the water torture; the cramps are severe, and he
will ache for a week or more.� But we
don't need to wait that long for the questioning to resume.

����������� It seems the
warlock is tough. Torture that would have broken most witches has not yet
wrenched the truth from this one.

����������� If it had not
been for his open defiance of the Witchseekers prior to turning himself in for
examination, I would have pronounced him innocent.� Now, I believe otherwise, and I seek to prove
it.

����������� Bubba is wrenched
into the torture chamber by two guards.�
Neither man is small; but Bubba, tall and strapping, his strength
recovered a little, fights them every step.�
Even with wrists bound behind his back, he tests the guards' grip.

����������� Behind are three
figures; The Witchseekers, Steve and Austin, and my sister-dungeon mistress,
Tina deDance.

����������� In the open space
beneath the suspension-chain, Bubba is thrown to the stone floor.� He lands on his knees, and crouches low.

����������� I acknowledge my
associates, then look down at the cowering warlock. &quot;Bubba.� Who so bravely resisted the water torture ...
you know, you should have confessed while the going was so easy.&quot;

����������� Bubba addresses
the floor: &quot;I am innocent, and nothing you can do to me will change
that.&quot;

����������� I purse my lips,
pretending to peruse that idea. &quot;Now, the problem is, a guilty warlock
would say exactly the same thing to save his arse. So I think we'll just let
the truth find its own way out.&quot; To Steve, I say, &quot;please,
proceed.&quot;

����������� Bubba's wrists
have already been bound behind him; now, the two guards push him face-down on
the floor.� Steve brings an iron bar,
known as a 'spreader;' more than a yard long, with a manacle at each end.� Austin holds one leg so that Steve can close
one fetter of the 'spreader-bar' about Bubba's ankle; then, struggling against
the fighting warlock, the two men force Bubba's other ankle into the remaining
fetter, locking it firmly.

����������� Bubba lies on his
belly, panting and growling, his legs now broadly-spread.

����������� Feared for his
prowess in the torture chamber as well as at the burning stake, the Witchseeker
Steve will be instrumental in today's proceedings; it is he who has chosen and
checked most of the implements.� His
seasoned associate,� Austin, has seen
more witches put to flame than any other in his time, and is on hand to assist
as well.

����������� Steve orders one
of the attending guards to bring over the heaviest of the iron weights; a
fifty-pound ingot.� By a short chain, the
iron weight is attached to a mooring point in the centre of the spreader-bar.

Bubba knows already what is to
come.� But either he is brave, or stupid
beyond belief; he says nothing, even as the suspension-chain is lowered, passed
between his bound wrists, and securely locked.�
Steve checks all; bonds, fastening, chains, then nods to me.

&quot;Raise him,&quot; I say.

It is Austin himself who turns
the crank.� The ratchet clinks over, the
chain rattles and clatters, drawing through the pulley high overhead, and
Bubba's arms are lifted behind his back. Awkward with his ankles so widely
spread, he manages a kind of splayed kneel,�
but still the winch turns, and his arms lift higher up behind him.

Austin rolls the winch. Fighting
the constraints of the spreader-bar, Bubba somehow manages to find his feet;
but every inch he concedes is another two inches taken in by the winch, and it
is not long before he is on the balls of his feet, his arms rising ever-higher
behind his back. The strain shows in the definition of his arms' muscles; the
laterals and triceps stark and drawn.

More steady clicks of the
winch.� His arms are pulled higher still,
his back bows forward, and Bubba groans with the discomfort. Normally his
physique would be beautiful, were it not contorted and strained, muscles bunched
against the chains' pull, veins bulging with the unnatural tensions.

I signal Austin to pause, and
lean my hands on my knees alongside the straining man, intimately close.� &quot;I will give you one more chance to tell
the truth and avoid what lies ahead. Tell me now that you are a warlock, and I
will spare you the torture.&quot;

Bubba lifts his head enough to
look into my eyes.� &quot;One day this
will be your fate, you double-crossing bitch,&quot; he snarls. &quot;One day,
you will burn. And on that day, I will watch, and laugh!&quot;

I smile. &quot;I'm sorry, am I
supposed to be frightened by that?&quot; I glance at Austin.� &quot;Please, Sir, continue.&quot;

����������� Bubba gives a
gasp and then a shout as the chain is drawn in, and, by his back-wrenched arms,
he is lifted off the floor.� The pain is
instant and severe. Agony in his arms, savage and heavy in his shoulder muscles
and triceps, feeling as if his elbows are on the verge of breaking; pain also
spears terribly down the outer muscles of his back.� The pain is so much that already he is
gasping, pitching his widely-spread feet for some kind of support.

����������� He is raised up
until his toes are six inches off the floor, with the heavy fifty-pound weight
still resting on the ground.� Already the
sweat is balling into droplets on his face and shoulders, his gasps and grunts
testament to the effect of strappado.�
But he does not ask to be let down, and he does not confess.

����������� &quot;We'll give
you a few hours to enjoy your new predicament,&quot; I say.

����������� Bubba's
barely-contained shout of pain follows our exit.

����������� I again watch,
over the closed-circuit monitor.� Bubba
hangs on the strappado chain, unable to keep still, unable to keep silent. It's
intolerable enough when it first begins; but after fifteen minutes it becomes
excruciating, and after half an hour, he is bellowing in pain.

����������� Anyone who has
ever had their arm twisted behind their back will have an inkling of how the
pain might be; many have broken within minutes of being hoisted like this.� And yet history is full of accounts of men
and women who have endured strappado without a single cry.

����������� Bubba is not one
of them.� Below his contorted shoulders,
his face is red with torment, and he shouts repeatedly at the floor as he
twists slowly on the end of the chain.�
The sweat drips from him, glistens on his naked body.

����������� Bubba's muscles
have been fighting to support his weight in the strappado; but after more than
an hour, they are burning, cramping, and losing strength. It makes the torment
much worse, as the full strain goes onto his tendons and ligaments. It is a
hot, hot pain; like burning irons thrust deep into his joints. 

����������� Three hours since
Bubba was put in strappado.� His cries
echo off stone walls.� I finally call
together Steve, Austin, and the two assisting guards, and we make our return to
the torture chamber.� Tina volunteers to
attend, in case her expertise is needed.�
Things are about to get much worse for Bubba if he doesn't confess.

����������� &quot;So � you've
had time to think about this,&quot; I say, one hand on my hip, regarding his
wretched, naked, hanging body with slight amusement.� Between his parted thighs, his cock dangles
soft and vulnerable.� I eye it
meaningfully. &quot;What's say we get serious, and discuss your knowledge of
the Black Arts?&quot;

����������� &quot;Aaargh,&quot;
Bubba gives. He shakes his head, sweat-drops tumbling.

����������� Is this guy a
sucker for punishment, or what?

����������� Austin hands me
two objects of heavy black iron.� I
cradle them in my palm and hold them beneath Bubba's pain-filled face.� &quot;Do you know what these are,
Warlock?&quot;� It doesn't take much
imagination: each consists of two slightly-concave studded plates, mounted in
opposition on a screw-tightening device, the size of oval castanets. Bubba
gives no answer, so I tell him. &quot;They're ball-crushers, baby.� And right now, they're all yours.� Let's see how they fit, shall we?&quot;

����������� &quot;Fuck
you,&quot; Bubba manages to spit.�
&quot;I won't confess!� You're - aaah! - torturing
an innocent man!&quot;

����������� &quot;We'll
see,&quot; I say with a shrug of one shoulder. 

����������� &quot;No!&quot;
Bubba shouts.� He tries to kick or thrash
his outspread legs, but the beauty of the spreader-bar is that he can merely
twist his hips and swing his feet ineffectually - and the chain connecting it
to the fifty-pound iron weight restricts his freedom to a few inches.� Struggling only sends worse agony through his
arms and shoulders, and he quickly realises his helplessness.

����������� With tenderness,
I reach out and cup his testicles in my hand; they are warm, firm. I select the
left, rolling it between my thumb and two fingers; even that is enough to make
him groan.� Holding the testicle, I fit
the first crusher over it.� It is a
simple matter to turn the screw until the two plates press lightly on his ball.� I do the same with the other testicle, so
that he hangs there with� two black metal
clamps on his scrotum.

����������� Neither Steve nor
Austin are watching; they keep their eyes averted.� Tina, on the other hand, cranes her neck to
get the best view of proceedings.

����������� No point in
wasting time: I twist the screw of the first, impelling the plates together,
and the pressure begins to tell at once.�
Bubba gives another shout; despite the agony in his twisted shoulders,
this is a different kind of pain, deep and nauseating, as the rounded studs
inside the crusher's plates press into his testicle.

����������� I twist the other
screw, the plates tighten.� Bubba
twitches and grunts.

����������� &quot;The truth,
now,&quot; I say, looking up at his anguished face.� My fingers are on the screw of the left
crusher.� &quot;Give me the truth.&quot;

����������� &quot;May God
forgive you,&quot; Bubba gasps.

����������� I twist the
screw.� The plates compress, and Bubba
jolts in his strappado, giving a new cry of pain.� His knees try to rise in reflex to the pain;
but all he does is jerk against the iron weight to which the spreader-bar is
chained, wrenching his own shoulders.

����������� I tighten the
crusher again, then again; Bubba gives another groan as his testicle begins to
distort under the pressure.� The rounded
metal studs of the device impress themselves in the sensitive tissue, and the
warlock is feeling it badly.

����������� &quot;Confess!&quot;
I urge, and twist the screw again.

����������� Bubba gives a
howl as his ball is squashed tighter.�
&quot;Oh god, take it off!!&quot;

����������� I screw it
tighter.

����������� Bubba lets out a
long scream of pain, jolting and thrashing, swinging his shackled feet, pumping
his hips as if he's simulating sex, trying to shake the crusher loose; but he
is confined to the pain.� I ride out his
efforts, and twist the screw once again; his testicle is now squeezed to half
its normal width, and Bubba howls.

����������� But still no
confession.

����������� I step back and
regard him.� His face is dangerously pale
with growing nausea from the crusher; his shining and twisted body still
agonisingly in strappado.� It's time to
crank the torture up a notch or ten.

����������� &quot;Let's do
it,&quot; I tell Austin and Steve.

����������� Bubba is still
howling, and, twisting from his back-wrenched arms with the crusher tight on
his testicle, he doesn't notice that Steve and Austin have moved to the winch,
until it begins to turn, and he is raised up.�
As the clattering chain hauls his wretched shape higher, the chain linking
the spreader-bar to the fifty-pound weight grows taut.

����������� Bubba throws
up.� The pain from his testicle is
expressed as nausea, and a watery spurt splashes to the floor from his open
mouth.

����������� I shake my head
in disgust. &quot;Oh, how uncool.� Just
wind it in, guys.&quot;

����������� At my
instruction, Austin and Steve together haul the winch around.� In the few moments before the weight is
lifted from the ground, Bubba's body visibly straightens - his arms, backwards,
up behind his head; his spine and legs straight down - and he gives the most
terrible screams yet.

����������� The winch rolls,
and the fifty-pound weight on his ankles is lifted from the flagstones.� The additional strain on his burning and
tortured joints and ligaments is agony beyond belief, and he is screaming like
a madman. The winch is locked with the weight four inches from the ground.

There is no way Bubba can thrash
about, or even move, now; so I step in close again, and reach up to the
crushers squeezing his testicles.� None
too gently, I tighten the looser of the two, until it compresses his ball into
an oblong.� His screams are endless.

����������� &quot;I think the
crushers need to be tighter still,&quot; Tina offers.

����������� I block her with
a casual arm.� &quot;No, babe.� Not yet.�
Patience.� Let's leave him for a
while until the pain gets so much he'll do anything at all for it to
stop.&quot;

����������� Over the next
half hour, Bubba proves his ability to endure.�
In strappado, with his ankles locked widely-apart in a spreader-bar, a
heavy iron weight hanging off it, and one testicle squeezed to the point of
rupturing in the crusher, he is in quite overwhelming pain. The sweat pours off
him. The veins stand out on his forehead, through his contorted shoulders; the
striations of his arm muscles are stark and fierce with strain. He shouts and
moans and wails. But he does not confess that he is a warlock.

����������� I hug myself
against Tina's repeated glances in my direction: what are you
going to do about it? she seems to be saying, while Austin and
Steve simply wait patiently, expectantly for the next stage. I feel my face
reddening with humiliation that this man dangling in agony before us is
refusing to break under my ministrations.

����������� &quot;Fine,&quot;
I say, when, after forty minutes, he still hasn't so much as asked for
mercy.� &quot;We'll play it your
way.&quot;

����������� &quot;That's more
like it,&quot; I hear Tina say.

����������� I stand in front
of the groaning warlock. &quot;Confess, and it will go no further.&quot;

����������� &quot;Suck my
dick,&quot; the warlock manages to gasp.

����������� Well, if the
circumstances were different �

My hands are on the testicle
crusher's screw an instant later, and I give it two full turns. Bubba screams
in agony as a soft pop! comes from between the iron plates, his ball�s delicate internal
structure finally surrendering to the pressure.�
I make a twirling signal with my finger, and Steve and Austin begin to
turn the winch again.

����������� By his bound and
back-wrenched arms, the screaming Bubba is hoisted higher and higher, the
weight still dangling off his ankle-bar.�
Inch by inch he is raised towards the ceiling, until finally his wrists
touch the ring through which the chain runs.�
The iron weight itself is more than six feet above the floor.

����������� &quot;Confess, or
you are about to discover pain you never even imagined.&quot;

����������� Bubba gives a
wail of terror, looking down in dread, but shakes his head.

����������� I signal to drop
him.

����������� Austin releases
the brake.� The winch spins.� The chain clatters.� Bubba plunges towards the floor, his descent
lead by the iron weight; then abruptly, Austin snaps the winch's brake back
again.� Bubba is jammed to a halt with a bang! and his
shoulders instantly, spectacularly dislocate.�
His arms are suddenly straight up above him, yet around the wrong way;
his shoulders look grotesque and corkscrewed.�
His eyes bulge, even as dust floats down from the shuddering chain; the
heavy iron weight swings inches above the floor.

����������� Bubba screams. He
screams without pause for over a minute, long howls of agony that are painful
to the ears. His body slowly twists on the end of the chain like a pi�ata.� His own ligaments are the only things that keep
his arms attached to his body, and the pain that rips through his limbs is
beyond imagination.

����������� &quot;Again!&quot;
I call, and Tina gives a small cheer.

����������� Now, Bubba is
pleading through his shrieks. As the winch turns and he is raised up towards
the ceiling again, he begins gibbering like a madman.

����������� &quot;Oh god, no,
no!� Stop!� Don't do it again, I beg you, I beg you!� Don't, please!&quot;

����������� &quot;Confess and
it stops,&quot; I promise. I take the chance to select an iron bar from the
nearby implement table, and return with it dragging across the flagstones, a
metallic scraping joining the slow clatter of the winding chain.

����������� Bubba pisses in
terror as his wrists again touch the high ring.�
I have to jump back to avoid being splashed.� &quot;Oh god, no more!� No more!&quot; he begs.� Tears and sweat have wet his face.

����������� &quot;Oh, for
heaven's sake,&quot; I complain. &quot;Drop him.&quot;

����������� Bubba is
shrieking and screaming as they let him plummet.� He bangs! to a halt on the end of the chain
for the second time, his body jolting upwards briefly as if his ligaments were
bungy cords; his screams are terrible.

����������� As he hangs
there, bellowing and shrieking in maddened agony, heft the iron bar.� I eye up my target, then, in an, upswing
worthy of Serena Williams, I smash the bar up into Bubba's literally ironclad
left testicle.� It strikes with a clang,
slamming his tortured ball up into his groin.

����������� There is
disappointment that the blow seems to have no effect; in fact, Bubba falls
completely silent. 

����������� The truth is that
the breath has been flung from the poor fellow's lungs, and his eyes, all but
popping out of his head, prove that.�
Then, he screams; like a little girl.�
It is a high, blood-curdling shriek of agony.

����������� &quot;Christ!&quot;
shouts Tina, putting her hands over her ears.�
Even I am taken aback by the utter dementedness in his voice.� He takes deep, rasping breaths between each
scream, then chokes and vomits again; this time, it splashes my bare shoulder.

����������� &quot;Oh,
yuck!&quot; I shout, while Tina, behind me, laughs.� &quot;Dammit - drop him again!&quot;

����������� Steve and Austin
begin to turn the winch again, but as Bubba's ruined body is hoisted in jolts
and jerks again towards the ceiling, he starts shaking his head wildly.

����������� &quot;No
more!� No more!&quot; Bubba shrieks.
&quot;I
confess - anything - anything at all - take me off - no more - let me
down!&quot;� The words run together in
a desperate garble, and then he is screaming again, unable to form words,
unable to stop his cries.

����������� &quot;You confess
that you are a warlock?&quot; I check.

����������� Shrieking, he
nods.

����������� &quot;You admit
that you are a practitioner of the Black Arts?&quot;

����������� Again, the
desperate nod.

����������� &quot;And if I bring
you down, you will ratify that confession before the Witchseekers?&quot;

����������� &quot;Oh
go-o-o-od ye-e-e-sssss!&quot; he howls.

����������� I smirk at Tina,
then signal Austin and Steve to lower the screaming wretch.

����������� Bubba loses
consciousness before his feet touch the ground.�


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Bubba's Execution

&nbsp;

����������� The Warlock Bubba
was brought into the Witchseekers' chateau months ago.� He was put to the Question, and despite his
best efforts to resist, eventually confessed to witchcraft.� He then betrayed those witches with whom he
used to associate, bent utterly to his interrogators' will, revealing every
last secret.

����������� Since then, he
has languished in chains in a damp and lightless cell.

����������� But one more step
must be taken before Justice has been done.�
Bubba must die, in terrible pain and without a shred of dignity.

����������� For this
execution, I alone am responsible.� I
have dressed in the traditional colour - black.�
But it is a delightful dress, a criminally-short silk baby-doll dress
with shoestring straps, an open lattice back with cris-cross strings.� Shoes are simple open sandals with laces that
tie at the ankle.� Very sexy.

����������� It's impossible
to wear a bra with a dress this flimsy, and I can see my associates' eyes
wandering from time to time to my breasts - my nipples jut shamelessly against
the feather-light fabric in the chill of the dungeon as we march to Bubba's
cell. It isn't just cold, though, that makes them hard, and I am almost ashamed
to admit to myself that I am strangely excited by my newfound power.

����������� We reach a cell
at the end of a narrow, musty passageway in the very bowels of the dungeon, dug
into the bedrock.� The cell door itself
is solid iron, and must weigh five hundred pounds.� The jailer finds its key, releases the
padlock, draws the bolt, and, with effort, draws the creaking door open.� The light of our torches spills into a slimy,
claustrophobic space.� Windowless,
putrid; it stinks of sweat and human waste.

����������� Against the
facing wall slumps a greasy figure.�
Bubba, the once-arrogant Warlock who was brought to us and cruelly
broken in the torture chamber. When he was delivered to us, he was tanned,
muscular and tall; now, for all his stature, he seems fragile and pallid and
thin.

����������� His arms are
locked in chains above his head in manacles; his hands droop uselessly from the
iron fetters. His moustache has been joined by the beginnings of a straggly
beard. He has not shaved, nor bathed, nor worn clothes, nor even had the
freedom of his hands, for more than two months. I can feel my mouth curling in
disgust, and my eyes travel down to the filthy nest of hair in his groin, his
greasy cock and one surviving ball.

����������� There was a time
when this might have been a man to whom I would feel attracted. Flirted, using
my eyes and body; laid my small hand on his powerful thigh.� Unbuttoned his shirt with excited fingers and
gasps of delight; stroked his fuzzy chest or nuzzled my face into the fragrant
pockets of hair under his arms. Once I might have caressed the firm plateau of
his muscular belly, closed my fingers around his cock and made it hard, so that
I could take it into my mouth and deliver him to a new dimension of pleasure.

����������� Now, though, the
thought repels me.

����������� My gut instinct
is to grab the blade of one of our guards and slice this wretched man's
undefended throat, putting him out of his misery.� But his sins are too great for that, and
Bubba's death will not be so quick or merciful.

����������� &quot;Unchain
him, then bind his hands and bring him,&quot; I order.

����������� Bubba has not
seen daylight for months, and his face is twisted against the early morning
light as, with arms tied behind his back, naked and grubby, he is led out to
the execution site, flanked by eight guards, Austin, and myself.� He is bewildered, dazed, and fails to see
some of the things that may otherwise cause him to cry out in horror.� A pick-up parked nearby, its tray piled with
coal. Stacks of wood and brush. A lit brazier. All are clues to a day of
suffering beyond anything he could imagine. I note, with slight amusement, the
hose that stretches across the grass like a snake, coiled beside the brazier.� Just in case the fire gets out of control.

����������� There are people
gathered to watch the execution, even this early. Perhaps no more than a
hundred, but more will come as the day goes on.

����������� As we near the
place where Bubba is to die, he sees the centrepiece of what we have prepared
for him, and a hoarse cry of denial and dread rises from his throat. A wooden
cross, thirteen feet long and with a seven-foot crosspiece, lies on the grass,
its upper end slightly raised on chocks, its base positioned over a narrow
post-hole in the ground, a small pile of earth alongside. There are guide-ropes
looped around the ends of the crosspiece for raising the cross, and close by,
seven-inch nails and a heavy iron mallet.�
There is more to this cross, though; halfway down its upright post is an
upward-facing hook of iron, like a giant fishhook complete with a barbed
tip.� This simple addition will bring him
a whole new world of suffering as the day wears on.

����������� We are met by
Austin, that lumbering bear of a man, who has been given the duty of leading
the execution team.

����������� The morning air
is cool, and there are goosebumps on my bare arms and thighs; but I doubt it is
cold that has the naked Bubba trembling so violently.� The warlock's knees seem to grow weak.� He can barely put one bare foot in front of
the other as he is led over to the waiting cross.

����������� &quot;Lie on
it,&quot; I order calmly, when we arrive.

����������� No ceremony. No
point in delaying it. But Bubba, already on the verge of breaking down, finally
gives a howl of misery. &quot;Don't do this to me!� I beg you!&quot;

����������� &quot;Oh, for
heaven's sake.&quot; I really don't need this.

����������� &quot;Please,
please!� Have mercy! I've suffered
enough. Just make it quick, just kill me quickly, please! Not this!&quot; 

����������� &quot;Your
suffering will be a warning to others,&quot; I tell him. &quot;We will proceed
as planned and you will die slowly. Now get down!&quot;

����������� &quot;Secure
him.&quot; It is the growling voice of Austin, and at his order, the guards
wrestle Bubba down. Despite his months of incarceration held in chains, he
fights now with every ounce of his strength. But it is inevitable that he will
succumb, and all too soon they have him sitting on the cross, the cruel hook
less than an inch below his groin.�
Swiftly, the bonds on his wrists are loosened, but a guard grabs each
wrist and his arms are wrenched wide, his shoulders just below the level of the
crosspiece.

����������� &quot;Nail the
bastard down!&quot; comes a shout from the small watching crowd, and laughter
and whistles of approval echo the call.�
Knowing full well what is about to happen, Bubba shrieks and struggles,
the sweat building up over his bare skin now, sweat of terror and desperation,
his heart pounding hard, panic and dread driving him to fight.� His long arms are laid out along the
crosspiece.

����������� &quot;No!� No-o-o-o!&quot; he screams, as a third guard
holds his legs in a bear-hug grip, and a fourth grabs his left hand,
positioning it on the wooden crosspiece of the cross.� Now, Austin takes up one of the iron nails
and the hammer.

����������� I don't want to
watch. Blood unsettles me. But I am transfixed as Austin positions the tip of
the nail in the centre of Bubba's thick wrist, directly below the heel of his
hand.� Bubba's fingers claw and clutch
helplessly. Austin raises the hammer.

����������� Clink!

����������� The first blow
drives the nail deep.� It plunges deeply
into Bubba's wrist, shunting aside the delicate structure of bones and tendons,
but not destroying them; the pain hits, and Bubba lurches with such violence
that the guards are almost thrown off him.

����������� &quot;Aaaaaaaagghhhh!!&quot;� It is a hideous scream, and it lingers as
Austin strikes the nail again, then again, then again.� The iron sinks further with each blow, now
driving into the wood beneath Bubba's wrist.�
He is no longer trying to pull his arm away; the pain of the nail
through his wrist, shooting tendrils of fire up his arm, is too intense to
resist.� A small corona of blood appears
around the shaft of the nail, and dribbles down the side of his wrist, but it is
slow, proof that Austin has avoided any major blood vessels.

����������� The first nail
in, the guards go to Bubba's left arm.�
He shrieks and bellows, begging and pleading: &quot;no!� Oh God, no!�
Stop, please!&quot;� But his arm
held in place, his upturned wrist presented, and the sharp tip of the nail is
pressed to the skin.

����������� Clink!� Clink!�
Clink!� Bubba shrieks
in pain as the nail is hammered through his flesh and into the wood
beneath.� Each solid blow sends a
shockwave of agony down his arm, his fingers involuntary curling as nerves are
violated by the nail's path.

����������� The guards
release their hold on Bubba.� Wretched,
weeping, his body already clustered with sweat, Bubba lies naked on the wooden
cross, arms outstretched and nailed in place.�
His legs shift and stir in the agony, but it is not over yet.

����������� &quot;Now his
feet,&quot; Austin orders.

����������� Grasping the
warlock's lower legs, the guards lift and jerk his body downwards.� The result is instant and
spine-tingling.� Bubba screams in agony
as his wrists are twisted about on the nails, his arms wrenched, and the barbed
tip of the iron hook stabs up into the sensitive pucker of his anus.� They draw him downwards, not quite enough for
his legs to be straight, then place his left foot flat on the upright of the
cross, his right foot on top of it.�
Bubba is still wailing, tortured by the nails in his wrists and the
violation of the hook in his arse, and makes no effort to resist as Austin
positions the nail.

����������� The mallet falls.

����������� Despite his pain,
Bubba jolts and shrieks anew as the nail smashes into his foot, driving through
muscle and sinew.� He twists where he
lies, again wrenching his wrists on the nails, and this time tearing his rectum
on the hook that skewers him.� The agony
is already excruciating, and his execution has not even started.

The nail pierces both feet and
enters the wood; the solid thunk thunk of its
penetration sends more shocks through the wood as Austin hammers it firmly
in.� Then he and the guards finally stand
and move back, so that they can inspect their work.

����������� Shining with
sweat, his stark ribcage and hollowed belly heaving with agonised breath, the
naked Bubba lies on the cross in the classic position of the crucified
man.� His eyes stare wildly towards the
sky, his mouth open in a grimace of pain.�
The dark-red trickles of blood mark where the nails pinion his wrists
and feet, his pelvis oddly tilted to try and lessen the pain of the hook
embedded in his arsehole.

����������� Austin looks to
me, and I nod.

&quot;Raise him,&quot; I order.

����������� The guards take
their positions - two to each guide rope, four crouching at the crosspiece,
ready to lift.� On Austin's order, all
eight men heave, shouting and grunting.�
Bubba squeals as the cross is lifted slightly, tipping as its base sinks
into the hole.� Taking advantage of the
inertia, the guards lift and haul, and the cross rises up; two feet, three
feet, four feet, its ascent cheered by the crowd.

����������� For a moment, it
seems to stall, its upright wedged near the top of the hole, the men
readjusting their positions.� Then, as
all eight refocus their efforts, the cross rises up into the morning air.� Like a crowing rooster, Bubba gives a long
scream as he is lifted, his weight suddenly shifting, stretching his arms,
dragging on the nails through his wrists, forcing the hook in his arse deeper
inside his bowels.� Those in the watching
crowd clap and shout their delight at the spectacle.

����������� Then, the base of
the cross slides down into the two-foot-deep hole.� The whole thing rocks forward, and thuds into place
with an impact that seems to shake the ground, jarring Bubba violently where he
hangs.� It all but wrenches him off the
nails, and he gives another terrible scream of agony.� The crowd gives a mighty cheer of approval.

����������� While six of the
guards hold the cross steady, their two companions grab shovels and pack earth
down into the hole, wedging the base firmly.�
Even with its lower part as a foundation, the cross is tall enough for
Bubba's skewered feet to be almost a yard above the ground.� His head rolls forward and he wails again in
agony, crucified.

����������� The ropes are
tugged free of the crosspiece, the earth around the upright is packed.� The cross stands, a symbol of suffering
throughout history, with this worthless wretch hanging upon it. The dawn fog
has not even lifted from the nearby trees, the first sunlight catching the
uppermost tip of the wooden upright.

There is another scattering of
applause from the watching crowd. Some are wandering off, to return later;
others seem to be here for the day, with picnic baskets and blankets, already
reviewing the cross-raising on their digital camera screens. Across the open
space, I can see more people arriving.

����������� In making Bubba's
last day alive also the longest day he will ever endure, we're not doing him
any favours. His first few minutes hanging on the cross are utter agony, and it
will only get worse. Far, far worse. The torture of crucifixion is widely
known, and in Bubba's instance, it is even crueller.

The agony of hanging by the
wrists is bad; by nails through the wrists is more terrible still. With the
barbed hook buried deep in his rectum and a nail through his feet, every moment
is sheer living hell.� 

����������� Posting the first
shift of four guards to flank the cross, Austin, the remaining guards, and I
retire to the chateau. Bubba is left to suffer, alone, naked, high on his cross
as the morning sun ignites his flesh.

����������� The morning hours
pass slowly for the suffering warlock. From my open window in the chateau, I
can see the cross that stands in the wide open space below. The crowd of
sightseers steadily grows.� From time to
time I hear a cry from Bubba, like the lowing of a distant cow. Such is his
pain, he will barely be aware of the burning in his chest as he draws breath to
cry out again; but it is a hint of the horrors still to come.

����������� I break for
morning tea at ten, knowing that the three hours Bubba has spent nailed up on
the cross have been a nightmare beyond imagination. The pain in his nailed
wrists and strained arms is so intense that he would do anything to ease it. Almost anything.
Because every time he tries to push himself up, he tears the flesh and bends
the bones of his feet a little more on their impaling nail, and rakes the
lining of his rectum with the barb of the hook in his arse, bringing unbearable
pain. So he hangs again - but that is equally unbearable. And so it becomes an
endless writhing dance, up on the cross. It is much to the delight of the
spectators; it looks as if he is trying to fuck his own arse on the iron hook.

����������� The sinewy
musculature of his body is stark and defined with his ongoing struggles,
emphasised by the oiling of sweat that glistens in the morning sunlight over
his body.� He is consumed by the pains
that torment him, struggling simply to exist through each terrible second.

����������� I return to my
work.

����������� By lunchtime,
there are perhaps five hundred people gathered, so I take a leisurely stroll
down to the execution site for a closer look. Most in the crowd don�t even care
to watch the ongoing torture of the crucified Bubba, preferring to chat and
pass the time with their friends, knowing that the warlock is paying dearly for
his pact with Satan in every shrieking moment. I hear reports that he has been
pleading and begging from his cruel suspension, imploring somebody to please
kill him. But his cries are met only with derision and laughter.

����������� The sun is high,
by now, and while it warms my bare limbs in my barely-there dress, its searing
touch only adds to Bubba's his ordeal. It draws new sweat from his skin.� As his struggles tear the flesh of his wrists
and feet, slow rivulets of blood run down the wood of the cross, staining the
crosspiece, dripping to the bare earth below.�
And now, six hours after being lifted into place, Bubba is beginning to
experience a new torment.

����������� The muscles of
his chest and diaphragm have been struggling against the unusual stresses of
suspension.� Now, fatigued, they are
beginning to fail, and he is fighting to draw breath.� The only way he can relieve this new torture
is to try and push himself up by his nailed feet; now, despite the agony, he
does so.� His feet grind down onto the
nail that pierces them; the hook in his arse tears a terrible wound, and as he
rises up and gasps precious air, it is released almost at once in a horrible
scream.� He drops at once into a hang
again, but the damage is done.� Fresh
blood runs down his feet, and now streaks the insides of his legs from the hook
inside him.

����������� For a time, Bubba
is racked with sobs, his chest and belly heaving, his spirit utterly broken by
his torture on the cross. But even if he wanted to give up and let suffocation
end his agony, his body wouldn't let him. The urge to breathe overcomes the
pain, the weakness, the humiliation of hanging wrecked and dying in front of
the multitude.

����������� Again and again,
he struggles. Tearing the flesh of his feet and wrists, humping the hook in his
arse like some depraved gigolo.� Crying
and screaming out.� Suffering without
dignity or bravado.

����������� The afternoon
drags on for Bubba while the crowd swells to just under a thousand. A
surprising turnout considering it is a man, and not some pretty young woman,
being publicly executed. But the nature of this execution is so novel in its
cruelty that it appeals to the curiosity of all, and Bubba doesn't disappoint. He
suffers in such abject misery, struggling and screaming, although he grows
weaker as exhaustion and dehydration take their toll. 

����������� I return to my
work, but rejoin the crowd a couple of hours later, this time bringing my
official papers. The sun is sinking behind the chateau, its shadow long across
the open ground, and the crowd is growing restless as the day grows cool. Bubba
is nearing the end of his strength, finally hanging crooked and drained, the
blood dried on his limbs and the wood of the cross, his chest barely shifting.
His eyes are still open, but seem glazed. Only the constant sheen of sweat
shows that he is still aware of every agony in his ravaged body.

����������� It is a little
before six when Austin makes his return, accompanied by three volunteers carrying
shovels.� The brazier has been smoking
quietly, twenty feet away, all day; its dusty-smoke smell has been since joined
by the aroma of barbecues, foreshadowing what is about to come.� In the minutes following Austin's arrival,
people begin hurrying forward, their attention again on the warlock on the
cross, and quickly the scattered audience concentrates into a throng, a huge
half-circle fifty feet from the execution site.

����������� The pick-up laden
with coal, parked nearby, is reversed to within a dozen yards of the cross;
Austin stokes the coals in the brazier, sending sparks up into the air.

����������� God.� Six o'clock.�
My moment. �Even in this dress, I can
feel nervous sweat in my armpits as I unfold my papers and make my way to the
foot of the cross.� I raise my hands high
and call out, 

����������� &quot;Witchseekers!� Citizens!&quot;

����������� A hush quickly
calls, although there is a flurry of camera flashes and at least one
wolf-whistle. Apparently the skimpy dress is appreciated. Battling my
self-consciousness, I begin proceedings for my first execution.

&quot;As Acting Witchseeker
General, I welcome you all, this evening. In these turbulent times, we face
many threats from those who have fallen into evil ways, and treachery has
wounded us all.� The warlock who suffers
before you now is such a case, one who tried to join our ranks as Seeker, but
was soon exposed. To crimes of Witchcraft, for acts of fornication with witches
and demonesses, and for sins against Mankind and God, the warlock Bubba has
confessed.

&quot;For these crimes, in these
times, he must be punished severely, so that a warning will be sent to all men
who would follow his despicable example.�
Let Bubba now be put to death by fire!&quot;

My cry is echoed by a great cheer
form the crowd, and I feel a rush of excitement.� At once, Austin scoops a shovel full of
burning coals from the brazier and sprinkles them on the ground three yards in
front of the cross.� Another guard brings
another shovel full, then a third, until there is a small heap of burning coal
on the ground.

����������� Then, the heaped coal
from the back of the pick-up truck is shovelled on top of the small fire.� It crackles and smokes, a grey pall that
drifts up into the dusk, and a few orange flames flick hungrily up through the
drifting coal-dust.� More and more coal
is added, until there is a great black smoking mound before the moaning,
crucified Bubba.

����������� As the cremating
coals heat, a girl comes forward from the crowd, talking her way past one of
the guards and hurrying up to Austin.�
The big man bends to listen to her, then nods, and goes to fetch
something, which he hands to her.� A
moment later, she is braving the growing wall of warmth from the coals, to
approach the cross on which Bubba hangs agonised.� It is then that I see the long, slim steel
skewer in her hand - and the mallet, which Austin has given her.

����������� Despite the
tortures inflicted on him, including the mashing of one testicle, Bubba still
has the other testicle intact.� A detail
obviously not missed by some of the more keen-eyed in the crowd.� Now, while the wretch hangs gleaming and
exhausted, the girl rests the point of the skewer against Bubba's unprotected
ball, raises the mallet, and begins to tap gently.

����������� Life and
awareness return to Bubba with a terrible scream.� His body arches up on the cross, wrenching
himself on the nails and hook again.� The
skewer, half an inch into the testicle, is almost shaken loose, so as Bubba
sinks back down, the girl hammers it hard.�
It slides through his ball and into the wooden post of the cross.� Bubba shrieks again, but this time he is
pinned in place by his own impaled testicle, and as the girl hammers the steel
pin deeply into the wood, the warlock throws his head from side to side,
howling in agony.� There is cheering from
the crowd; and her task completed, the girl quickly darts away from the growing
discomfort of heat from the coals.

����������� But for Bubba
there is no escape.� Naked and raised up
on the cross, he is spread out and open as the scorching heat of the burning
coals radiates out.� Even from twenty
feet away, I can feel it on my face and bare limbs, opening capillaries and
heating my skin.� Bubba, barely ten feet
away from it, turns his face.� New sweat
beads on his naked body, and I can see his muscles shifting, but he is held
immobilised by the excruciating pain in his skewered ball.

����������� Over the next
hour, as the sun sets and darkness falls, the fire grows.� Flames break out through the mound of coals,
flaring to the sky, huge rolls of smoke billowing up.� Bubba is orange-lit in its glow, appearing to
shimmer and shift behind the fierce heat.�
It is close enough to scorch and sear him, but too far to kill him, and
the constant cooling effect of air being sucked into the fire prevents heat
from ending his life too soon.� It grows
too hot for me, and I take a long walk around the edge of the crowd, listening
to the excited chatter, seeing the occasional camera flash. Bubba's wounded
howls occasionally echo out from where he hangs on the cross, proof that he
still lives, still suffers.

����������� Finally, the
roaring flames of the coals die down, and instead they shimmer and pulse angry
orange with savage heat.� Austin and his
volunteer companions gather their shovels for the next stage of the execution.

����������� It is tough work;
even in long sleeves and heavy clothing, the men struggle against the heat as
they begin to spread the coals around the base of the cross, like a glowing
lake of fire.� Three inches deep, ten
feet across, a fiercely-glowing blanket.�
Bubba on his cross is lit from beneath by its cruel red light, and as
the coals are shifted into place, the blistering heat engulfs him.

����������� It takes only a
minute.

����������� He squirms.� Shifts.�
Gives a moan.� But like meat over
a barbecue, he is surrounded by a terrible bed of glowing coals, and there is
no escaping it.� There is a visible wall
of heat, a shimmering updraft that stirs his hair and causes him to turn his
face towards the sky.

����������� His feet begin to
roast.

����������� Bubba gives a
wail as this new agony overrides everything he has suffered before.� The heat of the coals is literally starting
to cook his skin, and as the fats and oils are drawn out and the ends of his
toes start to split and blister, he is suddenly trying to wrench himself higher
up the cross.� He barks, shouts, then
screams at the top of his voice, as his lower legs start to redden.� In a frantic effort, he flexes every muscle
in his tormented body to rise up.� As he
does, the skewer through his testicle rips his scrotum open.� I look away, but there is no avoiding the
screams as remaining ball is suddenly exposed to the blistering air, the
delicate internal anatomy hit by the funnelling heat.

����������� Somehow, Bubba
arches his back and pelvis off the cross, his legs straightening, the nail
through his feet bearing all his weight in a hideous torture as he tries to
escape the heat of the coals.� He has
left his ball behind, a fat bloodied grape on its skewer; now the hook in his
rectum all but disembowels him, ripping him open in a horrific display. Blood
streams down the insides of his blistering thighs, and some in the crowd put
their hands over their mouths in amazement at the gory spectacle.

����������� But the terrible
agony of the fire is so great that Bubba can't help rising and falling again
and again, despite the grinding of the nails through his flesh, despite the
hook brutally tearing in and out of his arse.�
He screams and howls but he can't stop trying to lift himself away from
the fire. His feet are beginning to smoke, oil and fat dripping to flare
brightly in the seething coals below him. 

����������� Bubba's
screeching is hideous, and the crowd cheers madly at the spectacle of the
warlock suffering so terribly. The hair on his body is charring. The wood of
the cross is beginning to visibly scorch, and there are small flames licking up
around the base.� The air becomes heavy
with an unmistakable smell; that of roasting meat.

����������� By now he must be
in a nightmare world of near-madness.�
Tortured by an entire day up on the cross, and now being slowly roasted
over a bed of coals.� The cameras flash
and people point and cheer and exclaim, all knowing that the warlock is in his
final climactic throes of torment.

����������� Then, an act of
cruelty that takes my breath away.� Three
pretty teenagers in halter tops and boob-tubes and miniskirts run giggling and
shouting up to the hose that has been provided in case the fire goes out of
control.� I look in alarm to Austin, but
he is watching with interest; a moment later, they are jetting cold water onto
the suspended, screaming warlock.� Steam
curls from his skin, billows upwards from the coals beneath him; but as quickly
as it was turned on, the hose is shut off.

����������� Temporarily
cooled, Bubba stops his shrieking, and hangs bewildered and dripping, dazed,
his lower legs steaming.� But in less
than half a minute, the water has evaporated, and the searing heat again begins
to torture him.� Once again, Bubba begins
to shriek, struggling, writhing and rearing up on the cross.

����������� &quot;Oh
God, please have mercy!&quot;

����������� They are the only
discernible words, as his cries dissolve again into inarticulate shouts and
screams of pain.� Shouting and jeering at
him, the girls with the hose let him burn and scream for long minutes, then
hose him down again.

����������� The three girls
torture him like that for almost an hour.

����������� It is a hit with
the crowd, cheers rising up every time the water spray reaches the crucified
Bubba, slow rhythmic clapping as the heat and pain again build up.� I have never witnessed a burning so
prolonged.� How this man has remained
alive throughout the horrors of the day is beyond my comprehension.

With each round of water from the
hose, however, Bubba's ensuing reaction to the fire becomes weaker.� Finally, the heat and exhaustion steal the
last of his strength.� Steam, and then
smoke, wisps up from his feet and lower legs, and though his head shifts from
side to side and his clawed fingers twitch from the ruined nerves in his wrists,
he has no more reserves to struggle. �He
can do nothing other than suffer unbearable, excruciating pain, and wait for
death's release.

����������� Their game over,
bare limbs oiled with perspiration from the heat of the fire, the three young
women sashay proudly back into the welcoming crowd.

����������� Seeing that the
warlock is fading fast, Austin signals his three volunteers.� They gather up armfuls of the brushwood that
has been bundled ready for the burning, and, turning their faces from the
savage heat of the coals, bring it close enough to throw onto the fire beneath
Bubba's feet.

The brush is dry and thin, and
flames explode upwards, reaching, spiralling, twisting up around the warlock's
unprotected legs.� More is thrown onto
the fire, and the crackling, roaring sound of the burning brushwood is joined
once more by the shrieking of Bubba as he is encircled in savage, tearing
razors of fire.� The heat of it feels
scorching even from thirty feet away. 

����������� Flames rip and
race upwards, as more fuel is tossed onto to the fire.� The cross itself is alight, even the crosspiece
beginning to smoke.� Bubba's writhing
becomes jerky and frantic, but now that the flames are licking and embracing
his body, it is all but over.� His skin
is curling back, flayed from him by the knives of fire.� His flesh is alight like a giant candle, and
the mellow aroma of roasting is replaced by the odour of charring flesh.

����������� As fire explodes
up into the night sky, chasing a fireworks-cascade of sparks, the crowd hushes
to listen to its crackling, bellowing thunder.�
Bubba has become a shifting form veiled by flame.� And then, at last, he hangs motionless in the
midst of the inferno.

����������� It has been a day
of suffering in the extreme for the warlock Bubba.� But finally, it is over.� A scattering of applause goes through the
crowd.� Some people are packing up and
leaving.� Others will wait to watch the
warlock's bones explode, the eyes melt from their sockets, and his charred
remains finally tumble from the cross.

����������� Justice has been
done.

Part 5 � Wendy

&nbsp;

I have seen Wendy Satin's photograph,
but I didn't expect her to be as beautiful as this.� Perhaps it's the wedding gown she still wears
as Austin, Steve, and three guards drag her into the torture chamber. Sheer
white satin-weave, from its strapless bodice to the long fitted skirt, it is a
gorgeous dress. She wears no jewellery, but her blonde hair is tied in a
perfect chignon and adorned with flowers; white, lemon, and pale green. There
is a sprinkle of glitter across her cheekbones, a touch of rouge on her lips.

����������� &quot;What
the hell is this place?&quot;

Wendy's eyes are wide in disbelief at
the torture chamber before her; greasy stone columns, chains dangling on the
walls and from the high, vaulted ceiling; obscene instruments of suffering that
loom in the half-shadows cast by fluttering torches. The aromas of sweat and fear
and burned flesh have become infused in the very walls.

&quot;What do you want?� Why am I here?&quot; Wendy finally asks, in a
trembling voice.

&quot;Quiet, Witch, or we'll rip your
tongue out&quot; one of the guards growls, butting her shoulder-blade with his
hand. &quot;You'll speak only when a question is asked of you.&quot;

Wendy almost fires a retort, her eyes
blazing defiance, but she bites her lip instead. Her slim wrists are shackled
behind her back, and it gives her an almost coy demeanour; the reluctant bride.
The skin of her bare shoulders and d�colletage is delicious and flawless,
glowing with a golden tan.

&quot;She's had a few hours in a cell
to cool off,&quot; Steve tells me. &quot;When she realised the trap we'd set to
catch her, she went nuts. Tried to scratch Austin's eyes out, until we got the
shackles on her.&quot;

Wendy tugs on her trapped wrists.� &quot;It was a fucked-up trick to play,&quot;
she spits at Steve.� &quot;When I get out
of here, you'll all fry for this!&quot;

I barely hear the exchange.� I am so taken with the way she looks in her
gown, the incredibly fine stitching, the gorgeous boning of its bodice, the
sheen of the smoother-than-skin fabric, that for a few moments I fail to notice
Steve's expectant look.

&quot;You want we should strip her,
now?&quot;

Wendy:�
&quot;What?&quot;

I hesitate - tempted by the idea of
hanging her up by the wrists still in that dress.� But the reality of a night dangling in chains
- the half-moon tide marks of sweat and the grey of soot from the torches that
would quickly grubby the virgin fabric - prompt me to nod.� &quot;Okay - but it comes off over her head, get it?&quot;

The three guards and Steve look at me
as if I'm mad, but then Steve shrugs and, as Austin moves off to prepare for
Wendy's introduction to the torture chamber, gives the order.� Despite her protests and struggles, Wendy's
wrists are unfettered, and her arms are forcibly lifted while the dress is
unzipped and pulled off over her head.

&quot;Holy smokes,&quot; one of the
guards says.

As soon as the dress is off, Wendy
clasps her hands over her pouting breasts to preserve her modesty; but all
attention is on the delicate white silk panties she wears, and the white
suspender-belt attached to sheer, translucent-white silk stockings that end
high on her golden thighs.� She wears
simple white slip-on shoes with two inch heels, and with her hair still
prettily adorned and her flawless makeup, even I can't deny that she looks most
appealing.

&quot;Aww, come on, Boss,&quot; a guard
implores Steve.� &quot;You gotta let us have a piece of this one!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, please - while she's still
in once piece,&quot; the first adds.

Steve looks shaken by Wendy's allure; I
can see him thinking what a waste � but then his eyes catch mine.

&quot;If anyone tries to deflower this
bride, I'll have their balls in a vise,&quot; I snarl.� &quot;We do not fuck
the business.&quot;

Wendy's eyes meet mine, and behind the
hatred, I see that she concedes a little gratitude.� &quot;Thank you,&quot; she says in a low
voice.

I look at her grimly.� &quot;This has nothing to do with protecting you.� It's
the men I'm concerned about�
- fornicating with a witch is sheer stupidity.&quot;

Gratitude turns to anger.� &quot;But I'm not a witch, damn you!&quot; 

&quot;That's what we are all here to
determine,&quot; I reply.

She looks at me dumbly, and then,
finally, realises. Horror, for a moment, controls her expression, and she
shakes her head. &quot;No, no way! Are you all crazy? I demand you let me
go!� I don�t belong in this place!&quot;

�&quot;Oh, for heaven's sake, get a grip,&quot;
I tell her. &quot;We have a process to follow, and you will be fairly examined,
as every accused witch must be.&quot; To Steve and the guards, I say,� &quot;prepare her.&quot;

She will be hung by her wrists for the
next twelve hours.

So easy to say; so terrible to
endure.� Wendy has little idea of the
horror that lies ahead, as she is dragged over to the manacles that dangle on a
long chain from the ceiling. Her eyes follow the chain, up through a ring
moored in the high ceiling, and down to a ratchet-locked winch, at which Austin
stands ready, and I can see that her heart quickens in fear.� The very concept of restraint in iron
manacles is terrifying.

The guards miss no opportunities in
readying Wendy.� 'Accidentally' brushing
a hand across her bare breast or her silk-clad buttocks; touching her
stockinged thigh.� She curses and
struggles as they force her slim and unmarked wrists into the cold fetters,
closing and locking them so that her hands are trapped.

Steve nods to Austin, who slowly turns
the winch.� Nobody wants to miss this; as
the chain gradually rises, Wendy's slender arms are lifted up.� She is fighting to hide her fear as her hands
are pulled over her head.� A few more
turns of the winch, and her spine extends, her ribcage rising, and the pouting
mounds of her breasts are lifted also.�
Her belly hollows, her long legs grow taut, and, finally, with her arms
pulled hard above her head, her heels are lifted out of her high-heeled shoes.
Wendy grimaces, and I give a signal to pause.

Already, it is uncomfortable.� The iron bites into the bones of her wrists;
her arms are taking much of her weight, and her muscles are tight to
compensate.� There is a shine of nervous
perspiration in her pale and smooth-shaven armpits, between her breasts; but a
peppering of goosebumps down the corrugations of her ribcage, which shifts with
her rapid, fearful breath.� Her rosy
nipples are erect in the dungeon's chill.

She watches me with resentful
eyes.� No woman likes to be as exposed as
Wendy is right now.� Held on tip-toes
with her arms upstretched means that she is on display, half-naked and
helpless; and worse, her humiliation is to the delight of her captors.

I intend to rub that in. As is my
preference, I circle her, now. I want her to feel her vulnerability, I want her
to know my freedom.� I want her to know
that I can do what I want; I can whip her, or I can caress her, she can do
nothing.

Standing behind her, I admire the
perfect structure of her back; the definition of her shoulder blades, the long
gully of her spine, her figure's taper to a small and taut waist; her tight and
perfect buttocks within the delicate white triangle of her panties, the
suspender-belt around her waist. The feminine teardrop-shape of her sleek
calves, her slender thighs.� 

&quot;Continue,&quot; I decide.

The winch creaks over, and the chain
pulls.� Wendy stifles a gasp as the
manacles haul cruelly on her trapped hands, and, by them, she is lifted from
the floor.� She is at once swirling and
reaching her toes, frantically trying to find some easement from the pressure
on her hands and arms, but as the winch turns, she rises higher still; three
inches, four inches, five inches, leaving her shoes on the floor below her
swinging toes.

&quot;Let me down!&quot; Wendy shrieks.

I order the winch to stop at six
inches.� Enough for her to be tantalisingly
close to the ground, but knowing that she will never reach it.� Between upstretched arms, her face has grown
dark with her efforts to endure the discomfort.�
Her arms' muscles are tight in involuntary resistance to
suspension.� It feels, to her, as if her
body is already drawing longer.

&quot;You bastards!&quot; she
shouts.� &quot;It hurts!� Let me down, now!&quot;

&quot;You will be let down when we are
ready,&quot; I tell her.

&quot;Fuck you, you bitch!&quot; Wendy
shouts.� She kicks and pedals her feet,
and her angry cries chase us as we leave her hanging in the torture chamber.

Instead, I watch her on the monitor in
my room, knowing that Wendy's ordeal hanging by her wrists will be a battle
fought over many hours.

The initial discomforts are obvious;
pain in her wrists, and the psychological torture.� Her full bodyweight is on those iron shackles
locked below her hands, and the edges, although rounded, feel as if they're
cutting into her wrist bones.� Her jaw is
clenched in an effort to endure; she tips her head back and pedals her feet,
swinging slowly on the end of the chain.�
As much as she is able, she tries to move her hands within the shackles,
letting the iron wedge against the heels of her hands and relieving some of the
pressure from the bony parts of her wrists.

It is so sexy to watch.� This beautiful woman, hanging by her wrists
in shackles, naked but for those delicate white panties and her silk stockings;
stretching her toes towards the floor, kicking her feet about, staring up at
the fetters in frustration.

Although she fights to hide it, Wendy
is afraid.� She feels the deep, chilling
dread of imminent torture.� She knows it
will come, and she knows that, as long as she hangs there, she will be helpless
to it.� It is that fear of the inevitable
that drives her to escape.� She tries to
see behind her, tries to reach her feet out for anything that might give her an
opportunity, but of course, there is nothing.

Finally, after hanging for half an
hour, she clenches her teeth and tries to pull herself up.� Her fingers close into fists, the muscles in
her slender arms tighten and clench as she draws herself up.� All those hours in the gym getting into
honeymoon shape seem to have paid off; shaking with effort, she raises herself
until her eyes are level with the shackles.�
It is then she sees that they are locked by a catch that requires the
insertion of a screwdriver-like key.� She
cannot open them.

So she looks upwards.� The chain from which she hangs stretches
another six feet above her, through the ring in the ceiling, then down to the
winch some fifteen feet distant.�
Probably she knew all along that it was an inescapable restraint, but
desperation drove her to try anyway. 

Her strength hasn't failed yet.� The muscles in her arms are bunched and hard
as she holds herself up, and now I see the feminine definition of her belly as
she brings her knees up to her breasts.�
She is attempting, in some pseudo-gymnastic manoeuvre, to get her
stocking-clad feet up to the shackles and relieve the strain on her wrists and
arms.

I watch in fascination.� Wendy struggles for several minutes, trying
to kick her legs high enough, desperate to achieve any small victory; but as
simple as it is, her restraint is inescapable.�
With a final wail of misery, she accepts defeat, and drops clumsily back
into a full hang, swinging on the end of the chain.� Once again her perfect body dangles slender
and long, her skin now gleaming with a light sheen of sweat.� 

But for Wendy, the fight is far from
over.� I can see from the definition in
her arms that she still isn't ready to surrender to her suspension.� She is hanging, and by now she realises that
she can't escape that; but for now, she is still holding her body's weight with
her muscles.

Less than an hour after being hung in
chains, her muscles will be burning with fatigue, that same deep hurt that
comes with doing too many repetitions on the pull-down machine in the gym.� I can see it in her expression, and by the
gathering sweat on her body.� What was a
feminine glow is now a cluster of droplets all over her bare skin.� The torch light of the torture chamber
flashes off the liquid polish of her body, catches the slow drips that fall
from her down-turned face.� It is the
fiercest workout of her life, and it isn't going to stop just because she
reaches the point of exhaustion.

Still, she fights.� For another hour she hangs, struggling to
absorb the strain of suspension.� Her
white panties are translucent with the sweat that has run down the groove of
her navel, and now I can see the narrow shaved strip of her pubic hair.� Her stockings cling to her long legs.

I continue with my work, watching the
monitor from time to time, and after two hours, the strength of Wendy's toned
arms has finally been drained.� The
limpness spreads through her body and she dangles unresisting; but her
suffering has only just begun.� Her
body's weight is held now by her ligaments alone; it is a bone-deep, gnawing,
burning, unrelenting pain.� And there
isn't a thing she can do about it.

The torture has begun, so I switch off
the monitor.

Five hours later, when I turn it on
again to check on her, it's as if there is a still-photo on the screen, rather
than a live feed.� Only the flickering of
a torch in the background of the image shows that it's actual footage.� Wendy's gleaming body hangs motionless,
golden and half-naked in the torture chamber, her head almost resting on her
chest, her hands curled into useless claws above the manacles.� It is only when I zoom in and catch the rapid
shifting of her chest that I know she is still conscious, still in pain.

Her shoulder and elbow joints will, by
now, be in agony.� The pain will feel
fiery-hot, all the way along her arms, down into her ribcage.� Her wrists, too, will be burning from the
manacles' grip.� And it gets worse and
worse as the day crawls towards night; the more tired she gets, the worse the
pain will seem.� Every minute is a
lifetime to endure, a nightmare of pain and fear.

It will be no consolation to her that,
in her suspenders and stockings, she looks utterly sexy as she hangs there
suffering.

&nbsp;

The Witchseeker General and the Chief
Interrogator are among the delegation that assembles outside the torture
chamber in the morning.� The guards,
Austin, Steve, and a scribe are also present.�
Word has quickly got around that the accused witch hanging in chains in
the chamber is quite beautiful; although, of course, that is not the reason for
the presence of my superiors.

&quot;You have been remiss in your
duties,&quot; Oberon had told me earlier.�
&quot;You are meant to present accused witches for inspection before
putting them to the question.&quot;

So I have invited them to be
present.� Austin unlocks the heavy door
to the torture chamber and allows us in; I lead the procession across the floor
to where our prisoner still dangles, after some fifteen hours.

Wendy is still beautiful, hanging from
the manacles; her body shines as if with coconut oil.� The flowers are still in her hair, and the
suspender-and-stockings set seem as virgin-white and pristine as when she came
in.� The panties, though, have become
transparent with sweat and cling to her hips.�
She is so exhausted from her night of suffering that she fails to react
as we gather in front of her.

&quot;Bring her down,&quot; I tell
Austin.

He lumbers to the winch and cranks it
down a little.� Now, Wendy shows signs of
awareness, her head lifting.� Her eyes
look glazed with fatigue, but realising that she is finally being lowered, she
reaches her stockinged toes for the floor; when she touches it, she gives a
soft gasp of pain as the strained joints of her shoulders and elbows are
relieved of her bodyweight.

Austin stops the crank with Wendy's
heels an inch off the floor, so that she is forced to stand on the balls of her
feet.� Her head rocks forward, but then,
slowly, rises, her eyes filled with pain and defiance.

&quot;You bastards,&quot; she manages
to say.

&quot;Strip the little upstart,&quot;
Oberon says.

This task is mine.� Ignoring Wendy's ongoing curses, I release
the snaps of her stockings, one at a time, then draw the sheer fabric of her
left stocking down over her equally-silky thigh, then all the way off.� I do the same with the right, baring her long
and tanned legs.� Wendy damns me to Hell,
but exhausted and half-suspended as she is, she can offer no real resistance.

Oberon clears his throat and clasps his
hands in front of him.

Next I hook my thumbs over the
hip-strings of Wendy's damp panties and draw them down her legs, revealing the
tidy narrow strip of her pubic hair, the tight orbs of her naked buttocks.� Finally, the suspender belt, and she stands
stretched on tiptoes before the delegation, stark naked.

&quot;She is ready,&quot; I announce.

&quot;Oh, shit, here we go,&quot; Wendy
moans.

They swarm over her, and Wendy's
distress is apparent as she curses and struggles under the hands that grasp and
prod.� Their faces are� close to her golden curves, their breath on
her bare skin.� Several times a blemish
is noted, and reported to the scribe.�
Fingers probe between her thighs, separate her buttocks.� Not an inch of her body is missed, and the
examiners are finally satisfied.� Wendy
half-hangs humiliated.

&quot;Very, er ... very good,&quot;
Oberon says, his face flushed, evidently from his devotion to the task.

Tina is more cool, but her eyes flash
venom that any woman could be this perfect.�
&quot;This witch should be interrogated thoroughly,&quot; she says.� &quot;Whip her!� Then use the pear on her, and the
breast-ripper!� And hot irons on her
flesh!&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; shouts Wendy.

&quot;Woah, hang on,&quot; says Oberon.

&quot;Maybe that's too much,&quot;
Steve suggests.

&quot;Aw crap,&quot; says a guard.

&quot;I would prefer not to mar her
body unnecessarily,&quot; I say, to be diplomatic.� &quot;Once she is a confessed witch, she may
be tortured for information with impunity, but until then, we must consider her
future welfare.&quot;

Wendy inserts hastily, &quot;for God's
sake, I'm not a witch!&quot;

I ignore her.� &quot;May I suggest we christen a device I
have recently had constructed?&quot;

&quot;By all means,&quot; Oberon says,
in some relief.

&quot;Please,&quot; Wendy tries.� &quot;Please, you don't have to torture me, I
am innocent, I've told you, I'm not a witch!&quot;

&quot;It is expected that you will deny
being a witch,&quot; I say calmly, as the guards unfasten her bruised wrists
from the shackles above her head, &quot;until pain prevents you from uttering
any more lies.&quot;

With arms pinioned again behind her,
protesting still, Wendy is wrenched across the torture chamber in my wake;
followed by Oberon and Tina.� When her
eyes fall upon the device on which she is to suffer, what little strength
remains in her knees is drained, and she sags in the guards' grip.

&quot;Oh, shit,&quot; she groans.

It is called a chair, but bears only a
passing resemblance to one.

The focal point of this 'chair' is a
vertical spike.� Iron, twelve inches tall
and five inches diameter at its base.� A
toothed iron rail forms the 'back' of the chair, mounted on which is a narrow
carriage, fitted with manacles for wrists and elbows and a leather strap for
the torso, with a hand-crank so the torturer may raise or lower it a fraction
of an inch at a time.

There are other features; a chute
beneath the 'seat' of the chair leading to an insulated firebox, and an
adjustable series of vents in the seat itself, to channel hot air.� But these intricacies are lost on Wendy,
whose eyes are fixed only upon the terrible spike.

&quot;My God, you're all sick!&quot;
she erupts.

&quot;It is only through pain that the
Truth will emerge,&quot; I tell her.�
&quot;Guards, secure her for questioning.&quot;

&quot;You fucking perverts!� Let me go!&quot;

Screaming and struggling, Wendy is
wrestled to the chair and forced to straddle it.� The deadly spike stands between her spread
legs, its tip barely two inches below her anus.�
She gives a long wail of dread as her arms are pulled behind her, forced
into the manacles of the raised carriage at the back of the chair.� Elbows, first; squeezed cruelly together
behind her, barely four inches apart and restricting her ability to
struggle.� The strain is evident in the
tension of her pectoral muscles, the definition of her triceps; but more
distracting is the way her ribcage and breasts are thrust up-and-out.� Her wrists are snapped into the lower two
manacles, pressing her spine against the adjustable carriage.

The leather strap, also anchored on the
carriage, is passed around her lower ribcage - securing her torso as Austin
pulls it tight.� Her feet are forced into
the ankle manacles, low on either side of the chair's base, spreading her
thighs.� It takes her off balance,
putting most of her weight on her arms, and I can see panic on her face at the
realisation of how helpless she is.

Steve gives the bindings a final check,
then signals the all clear, and the guards step back.

Wendy looks magnificent.� Her naked body straddling the chair, the
spike poised below her, her arms cinched tightly together behind her.� Her thrusting breasts are heaving with fearful
breath, her nipples standing in defiance of the chill air, while a cold sweat
creeps over her exposed body.

&quot;You should be proud, Wendy,&quot;
I say.� &quot;You will be the first to
suffer upon this delight of persuasion!&quot;

&quot;You don't have to do this,&quot;
Wendy gasps, a last-ditch effort to save herself.� 

&quot;Yes, we do,&quot; I reply.

&quot;You're all out of your
minds!� If I confess, you'll burn me
alive at the stake!&quot;

&quot;Of course we will,&quot; I reply.

&quot;But ... what kind of choice is that?&quot;� She
looks up at me in growing despair.

&quot;When the pain has torn away your
ability to think, there won't be
a choice.� There will only be Truth,&quot; I tell her. 

Tina and Oberon nod in sage approval,
and Wendy gives a sob of misery.

I move behind the chair.� The crank of its carriage, to either side of
which Wendy's elbows and wrists are manacled, is fitted with a wooden handle,
and I close my hand around it.� With my
heart pounding in anticipation,� I give
it the first turn.

Smoothly, slowly, the carriage descends
the first quarter-inch, and Wendy is lowered fractionally towards the
spike.� It takes her by surprise, and she
gives a shriek, struggling to raise her hips; but the nature of her restraint
affords her little movement.� I turn the
crank again, forcing Wendy lower still, until the iron tip of the spike is
poised in the gully between her buttocks.

����������� &quot;You
fucking psycho, let me go!&quot; Wendy spits at me.� But I turn the handle again, the carriage
impels her lower still, and the spike's inquisitive point nudges Wendy's
clenched asshole.� The horror of its
touch brings a new wail from her, and I can see she is struggling to get free,
but to no avail.� Another turn, and she
is lowered a little further, the cold iron penetrating her anus by a quarter
inch.

����������� &quot;Oh
God, you'll rot in Hell for this!&quot; Wendy shouts.

����������� &quot;Me?� You're
the one who'll burn,&quot; I respond,
and punish her with several more turns of the handle.� Wendy sinks a whole inch down onto the spike,
the iron spreading her sphincter and probing deeper inside her.

����������� &quot;Okay!� Stop!&quot;�
She twists her head to try and see over her shoulder.� &quot;For God's sake let me up, I don't
deserve this!&quot;

����������� &quot;Tell
us the Truth,&quot; I insist.

����������� &quot;The
truth is I'm not a witch!� I'm not, I'm not, I swear!&quot;

����������� So
I crank the handle and the spike drives another half inch into Wendy's rectum.� She gives a grunt as her internal muscles
flex and spasm around the intrusion in a reflexive action, but she cannot eject
it, and I give another half inch to make that fact clear.� Wendy gives a shout of pain, followed by
another obscenity; her sphincter is spread an inch already, uncomfortable but
technically not pain.� She can feel the
iron tip more than two inches inside her, and we have barely started.

&quot;Confess that you are a
witch,&quot; I urge.

����������� &quot;If
I confess, you'll just hurt me more!&quot;

����������� &quot;Yes,
but this will stop,&quot; I say, as I turn the handle.� The carriage descends on its track, forcing
Wendy further down the spike, and she gives another groan.� Sweat is shining between her perfect
breasts.� With her arms so savagely
twisted into the manacles behind her, every muscle strains.

����������� I
crank her down two more notches, and she gives another moan as she is further
violated by the unforgiving iron, three inches inside her� It is not merely the physical aspect that
causes her such distress, but the utter humiliation of suffering on such a
device.� Her audience watches, enthralled
at her pain, entertained and aroused by the chair's slow violation of its
beautiful victim.

����������� I
give her four slow notches: with each click, the carriage descends minutely,
forcing her down.� The ever-widening
circumference of the spike slides into her rectum, stretching her sphincter,
and the pain is growing incrementally.

����������� From
behind, Wendy is quite a sight.� Her
tanned and slender arms manacled together to the chair's carriage unit; her
shoulder-blades jutting and pushed together.�
I can see the flare of her hips, and below her, the spike, its upper end
disappearing up between her buttocks.�
Sweat is gathering in droplets across her naked back.

����������� Click.� Her
head rocks forward.� &quot;Oh, God,
please stop!&quot;

����������� &quot;Confess
that you are a witch!&quot;

����������� &quot;No!� I won't lie!�
Fuck you!&quot;

����������� Click, click; the hard iron drives another half inch into her asshole, and
this time she gives a moan of pain.� Her
internal muscles are cramping and spasming urgently, and the chair is beginning
to deliver its potential.� The veins on
Wendy's neck stand out in her efforts to endure; she is breathing fast.

����������� Click.� Her
body shifts further down the spike and she gives a shriek.

����������� &quot;For
God's sake, stop!!&quot;

����������� Click.� Four
inches inside her, and she cries out again.�
Her anus has been spread nearly two inches, and it must hurt.� The tears begin to spill from her eyes.� &quot;Please,&quot; she calls out.

����������� But
I cannot let compassion influence me.�
Pain in the extreme is the only way to cut through the lies a witch
tells to save her flesh; and Wendy is not even close to suffering the way she
eventually must.� I give her body time to
adjust to the latest intrusion of the spike, then, firmly, turn the handle
again; click, click.

����������� Wendy
is forced another half inch down onto the impaling spike; its tip probes deep
inside her bowels while its circumference forces her anus wider, and she gives
a cry of pain.� &quot;Oh, God, stop
now!� Stop!&quot;

����������� But
this is nothing.� Inserting the pear
would hurt more. I give her another two notches, and the carriage wrenches her
down, the spike penetrating deeper into her ass, five inches now.� She wails with pain and humiliation.

����������� Oberon
and Austin are discussing how well the chair appears to be working; Tina comes
and stands beside me, with gentle fingers clearing a loose strand of hair from
Wendy's pain-flushed face, collecting droplets of sweat from the witch's tanned
shoulder.

����������� &quot;Why
not just crank her all the way down, right now?&quot; Tina asks me, and her
eyes, meeting mine, have a mischievous gleam.�
&quot;That would get a reaction!&quot;

����������� &quot;Too
fast, and she'll tear,&quot; I reply, and find the next notch.� Wendy's body is shoved down onto the spike,
and she barks in pain, her head rolling.�
&quot;It has to be done slowly, so her body has time to accommodate it.&quot;� Click.� 

����������� &quot;No-o-o-o!&quot; Wendy wails.

����������� &quot;She'd
confess,&quot; Tina tells me confidently.

����������� &quot;She
might not - and if not, she must be allowed to go free without life-threatening
injuries.&quot;

����������� Click.

����������� Wendy
shrieks again, and now I can hear an edge of true pain entering her voice, not
just the shouts of discomfort and dismay.�
The sweat is rolling off her body.�
I savour the next turn of the handle - click -
as six inches of iron are buried up inside her ass, her tender asshole spread
two and a half inches.

����������� She
is halfway.

����������� Click, click; as Wendy is impaled further, the pain grows and spreads.

����������� &quot;No!� No, I can't take it!&quot; she howls.

����������� It
doesn't deter me: I give her another notch, and the iron slides another quarter
inch into Wendy's rectum.� She screams
again.

Like the rack, or the pear, or the
boots, my chair delivers incrementally-greater pain, letting the prisoner
suffer mental anguish as well as physical as the torture worsens.� Wendy cries out endlessly in pain and horror
as, over the next twenty minutes, I slowly give the handle turn after painful
turn.

An hour after first being manacled to
the chair, she has eight inches of iron spike impaling her.� It fills not just her rectum, but the tip of
the spike has begun to probe and distend her colon.� It is an invasive, terrible pain.� Her anus has been stretched around its
circumference, spread by three-and-a-half inches.

����������� But
she is only two-thirds down, and the remaining inches are going to hurt more
than anything she has experienced in her life.�
As the next notch pushes her another quarter inch down onto the spike,
she gives a scream of pain.� The sweat is
a gloss over her naked body; her muscles are hard with her body's efforts to
cope, her thighs quivering as she tries unsuccessfully to brace her slow
descent.� Her pelvic floor muscles are
convulsing and pushing to try and eject the iron intruder, but it only adds to
her pain.

����������� Another
notch, and Wendy's mouth opens wide; she screams in pain.� The spike brings agony; it stretches,
distends, twists and distorts her internal organs, causing exquisite
agonies.� But it will not permanently
injure her.

����������� Click.� Wendy's
scream echoes from the stone ceiling.�
&quot;Please sto-o-o-op!&quot;

����������� &quot;Confess!&quot;
I urge.� &quot;Confess, and it will end!&quot;

����������� Wendy
gives a howl of misery.� &quot;You'll
burn me at the stake!&quot; she squeals.�
&quot;How can I confess?� Oh
please, please, stop torturing me!&quot;

����������� She
is still capable of rational thought; the Truth is not yet laid bare.� So I crank the handle again, and, with a
creaking sound, Wendy's ass sinks further onto the spike.� She gives a long scream of pain, and I watch
a rivulet of sweat slide down the groove of her spine.� Her shoulders are shaking with her
pain-wracked sobs.

����������� Nine
inches.

����������� The
mirth and entertained smiles of earlier have gone from my audience, now.� They know that this has entered the realms of
true torture.� Even Tina, earlier dubious
of the chair's ability to bring swift results, is looking impressed.� Wendy suffers beautifully, and as the next
notch pushes her further down the spike, she gives a contralto scream of pain,
her head back, her mouth wide.

����������� Click.� Where
the spike disappears into her anus, it is four inches across.� Wendy's sphincter is dilated grotesquely, her
rectum stretched, the pain driving deeply into her abdomen with the huge
intrusion of the spike.� Click.� Wendy's
screams are long and loud, her sweat-wet breasts and ribcage heaving with her
anguished breaths.

����������� It
has reached the point where each notch of descent onto the spike brings
significantly greater pain, and when I turn the handle again, after giving her
organs another five minutes to adjust, Wendy screams anew.� Already her voice is becoming hoarse; but
fatigue is to the torturer's advantage; it heightens the prisoner's perception
of pain.

����������� Click.� More
than ten inches.� Gradually, leaving
ever-longer periods of adjustment, I lower the carriage on its rail, impelling
Wendy, by her pinioned arms, further down onto the iron spike.

����������� As
the eleventh inch of iron disappears into her agonised rectum, Wendy shakes her
head over and over.� Her voice is weak,
now; the sweat drips from her lowered face, streaks her naked body.� She is shaking.

����������� Click.� Wendy
bellows, but even the slight motion of her diaphragm is creating fresh agonies
through her distended colon, and she tries with all of her strength to stifle
her own cries.� But when the carriage forces
her another quarter inch down onto the spike, and her buttocks finally kiss the
iron seat of the chair, she cannot help but scream once more.

����������� Click.� Wendy's
body spasms violently as the agony of the shifting spike racks her organs, but
her head is lolling, and her scream trails out to a long groan.� She coughs, wails with the agony it brings,
and then vomits up a small trickle of liquid; it spills down her defined belly.

����������� Click.� Just
when we thought there was no suffering left, Wendy finds voice to scream as she
is pushed down onto the spike again.� Her
anus is stretched five inches; the iron spike buried twelve inches inside
her.� It has taken an hour and a half,
but finally she is all the way down.�
Releasing the handle, I step around to regard my victim.

����������� Wendy
is panting.� Her head is lowered, her
mouth open, her eyes wide in disbelief at the pain that fills her lower body,
sweat dripping steadily from her face.�
If there is blood, it is minimal; none seeps from below her.� Her breaths come in shallow, panting gasps,
the pain preventing her from anything more.

����������� &quot;Say
that you are a witch,&quot; I demand.

����������� Wendy
manages a groan, then slowly shakes her head.

����������� She
believes that she has endured the worst that can be inflicted upon her by the
chair.� In truth, she has simply been
prepared for the real torture.

I look to the guards.� &quot;Anvil.�
Rope.� Tar.� A pail of water.� A woollen blanket.� And a lit candle,&quot; I say.� As the three men go, I mouth to my remaining
audience the words, ten minutes.� Wendy's
confession is close.� Drawing near her
gleaming body, I grasp her bundled hair, still adorned with flowers, and lift
her head.� Her face is running with
sweat; her eyes, heavy-lidded and barely focusing, fight to fix on my face.

&quot;It is time for the Truth, now, Wendy,&quot;
I say quietly.� &quot;Nothing else
matters.&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; she gasps.� &quot;Oh, God � it hurts �&quot;

The guards bring the heavy anvil, sixty
pounds of solid iron; along with the other items.� It is placed alongside the chair, and I
carefully release the shackle around Wendy's right ankle.� &quot;Hold her for me.&quot;

Pain from the spike draws another wail
from Wendy, and she is all but oblivious as the guards place her heel on the
anvil.� With the dark, oiled rope, I bind
her ankle and lash it to the iron, her leg sticking straight out from the
chair, her foot vertical.

Her toes are perfect, even sexy.� Delicate and slender, each nail painted with
an opaque white varnish, sculptured and buffed into shape.� Not a single imperfection.

For all the diabolical and
sophisticated devices at my disposal, there is still a place for the most
rudimentary methods of persuasion.� I
have been given a tub of tar, and a small brush; carefully, I daub some of the
thick, black ooze over Wendy's smallest toe.�
Her foot twitches and shifts at the brush's touch, so I hold it steady
with my hand, casually continuing.

Another spasm wracks her impaled
bowels, and Wendy gives an unprompted cry of agony.� 

I thickly coat each toe with tar;
taking care to cover the pad, to brush it in between the toes, over the
knuckles and nails.� Wendy knows that
something is happening to her foot, but she is dazed by the unceasing agony of
the spike.� Even so, I am careful to
explain to her what will follow.

&quot;I'm going to set light to your
toes, now, Wendy.� The tar will make sure
each one burns to the bone.� But before
they have all burned, you will confess.&quot;

At this new, awful threat, Wendy finds
a fevered lucidity, lifting her head to look in anguish at her trapped foot,
her tar-coated toes.� &quot;Goddamn
you,&quot; she sobs.� &quot;I swear, I'll
get you for this!&quot;

I extend my hand for the candle; the
guard hands it to me, and I carefully shield the flame, my eyes drawn to its
steady, bright teardrop-shape.� Then,
grasping Wendy's foot again, I lower the flame to Wendy's smallest toe.

&quot;No!&quot; Wendy shrieks in horror
and panic.� &quot;No!� No!!&quot;

The bright candle-flame embraces her
tar-covered toe, licking intimately.� The
tar smokes, then lazily catches alight with a fluttering flame.� I release Wendy's foot, and at once she is
rocking it from side to side, but the tar is alight, and flames quickly spread
from her smallest toe to the next, black smoke ribboning up into the air.

The pain hits.

Wendy jolts violently, wrenching
herself on the spike as the pain explodes up from her foot.� She screams.�
The bird-flap flutter of growing flames is quickly joined by the hissing
and crackling of her flesh burning.�
Another toe, then another; then all are alight.� Wendy shrieks and screeches in agony, her
struggles rattling the carriage to which her elbows and wrists are fettered;
she twists her body on the impaling anal spike; her leg shudders and jerks as
she tries to pull away, but she is helpless.

The flames jump six inches into the air
from her immolated toes, and Wendy screams and screams in agony.� She can not speak, nor think, she can only
thrash about, skewered on the hideous spike, all but dislocating her own arms
in her efforts to escape the pain.� Smoke
and flames twirl up from her burning foot.

And then, from her shrieks, words
barely-formed: &quot;I confess, I confess, I
confess, I confess, oh Jesus, I confess ...&quot;

&quot;You confess that you're a
witch?&quot; I cry.

&quot;I am!� I confess!�
I am, I am!&quot; she howls,
over and over as her toes burn brightly.

It is what we needed to hear.� I quickly drape the woollen blanket over her
foot, smothering the flames, but Wendy still howls and shrieks as the hot tar
cooks to the very marrow of her toes, an unfathomable pain. �I pick up the wooden pail of water, and pour
it over the blanket.� There is the deep
muted hiss of the hot tar being extinguished.

When I lift the blanket again, a puff
of steam rises up.� Wendy's two smallest
toes seem to have melted away, the others are curled and gnarled, the tar burnt
into her flesh.� Her chest shudders in
great, whooping breaths; her shining breasts jiggle, the tears streak her face.

&quot;Her confession is enough, for
now,&quot; I say to the scribe, but then I look to Steve.� &quot;Bring a brazier and place it behind
her.� Heat enough coals for our
purposes.� We will return in a few
hours.&quot;

Steve nods. 

&nbsp;

����������� The
chair has been christened, but not fully tested yet.� This fact is to be much to Wendy's
misfortune.

����������� Two
guards still stand watch over Wendy as I make my return, accompanied by the
usual observers, as well as Austin, and Steve. 

����������� The
confessed witch has been secured on the chair for hours.� Her bowels have been distended to accommodate
the huge intrusion, and cramps spear through her constantly, drawing groans,
her head turning in endless anguish.� Her
burned toes, too, must be a source of almost unbearable pain.� Fixed naked on the chair, her body gleaming,
even the flowers in her blonde hair seem to have wilted from the torture.� Her arms, cruelly twisted and pulled together
behind her back, must hurt almost as badly as in strappado; but the way the
restraint lifts her ribcage and presents her pouting, rosy-nippled breasts
still draws longing looks from the men.�
Her ankle has been returned to its shackle at the base of the chair, her
deformed foot� curled to guard her ruined
toes from knocks or touches.

����������� Three
yards away, a brazier has been filled with hot-burning coals, the air
shimmering above them.� A fresh pail of
water stands beside the chair.

����������� &quot;Wendy,
we� need to talk again,&quot; I say.

����������� Wendy
is too exhausted to show much fear, but her eyes flutter open and she looks at
me as I draw near.� &quot;We need you to
reaffirm your confession that you are a witch.&quot;

����������� She
nods.

����������� &quot;You
confirm it is true?&quot;

����������� &quot;I'm
a witch, I admit it,&quot; Wendy says weakly.�
&quot;Please, just let me up
�&quot;

����������� &quot;That's
the problem, Wendy,&quot; I say.�
&quot;We know that witches don't learn their craft without help.� We know that you'll have friends, other
witches, people you know.� Before we let
you find your release at the stake, we want you to tell us everything you
know.&quot;

Wendy looks bewildered through her
pain.� &quot;But I don't know anything
like that!&quot;

&quot;It's my job to help you
remember,&quot; I say.� To Steve;
&quot;will you kindly stoke the coals and make them ready?&quot; 

&quot;Oh, God, no,&quot; Wendy
pleads.� She is desperate.� &quot;I have confessed, damn you!� Just get on with it, just let me die!&quot;

&quot;And take all your secrets with
you?� I don't think so!&quot; I
respond.� &quot;But perhaps you can
remember, now, some details which may save you a lot of suffering?&quot;

The tears begin to spill.� &quot;I swear, I don't know!� You're all fucking monsters!� Tell me what I have to say, I'll say it, just
tell me!&quot;

&quot;It doesn't work that way,&quot; I
say.

I move to Wendy's side, aware that Tina
has joined me, eager to watch this next stage of the torture.

At the back of the chair, from its
base, is a chute of sorts; it provides access and ventilation to a firebox
beneath the spike.� While Wendy strains
to see what is happening, I give the nod to Steve, who, wearing heavy
industrial gloves, scoops from the brazier a shovel full of glowing and flaming
coals.� Embers and sparks drift brightly
to the floor, grey smoke trails his approach.

I bend close to Wendy's ear, near
enough so that I can see the drops of perspiration that crawl down the side of
her face.� I put my hand gently to her
upper chest, and feel the rapid knocking of her terrified heart through her
clammy-hot skin.� &quot;Soon, you will
feel pain unlike anything you have experienced yet.&quot;

I am so close to Wendy that I actually
see the tiny blonde hairs on the bare nape of her neck rise at my words, and a
moment later, Steve pours the coals into the chute, filling the firebox beneath
her.� She erupts into tears.� Not just weeping, but bawling, shaking her
head, her feisty spirit broken.� I step
back, and watch.

There is a glow from the firebox
chute.� The coals, piled against the
foundations of the spike, are starting to heat the iron.� That heat will travel all the way up, warming
the metal inside Wendy's bowels; a truly cruel addition to the torment she
already suffers.

For several minutes she sits and sobs,
the rest of us wait.

&quot;Please, tell me what you want
from me,&quot; she tries.

&quot;Details,&quot; I say.� &quot;Names.�
Places.� Evidence of your
guilt.&quot;

&quot;Evidence?� Like what?&quot;

&quot;Tell us about your liaisons with
Satan,&quot; Oberon contributes.

&quot;I don't know anything like
that,&quot; Wendy moans.� &quot;I'm
sorry, I'm so sorry, please, I don't know anything!&quot;

She is beginning to squirm, and I
realise that the spike is hurting more as its iron grows warmer from the coals.

&quot;Have you fornicated with the
Devil?&quot; Austin asks.

&quot;No!&quot; Wendy says, then gives
a whimper; the muscles in her arms and belly tense as she endeavours to pull
herself off the heating spike.� &quot;Oh
God � yes, maybe �&quot;

&quot;Describe what you did,&quot;
Austin urges.

&quot;Tell us names,&quot; I hiss at her.�
&quot;Those who deserve to burn!&quot;

Wendy's eyes are open wide, now, the
panic showing on her face.� Her fingers
are fluttering beyond her wrist manacles.�
Her feet are twisting in their shackles.�
The spike is getting hot.

&quot;Names?� The names of anyone?&quot; she asks.

&quot;The names of witches,&quot; I say.

&quot;I don't know the names of
witches!� Oh, God, take me off, please, please, it's burning me now!&quot;

I rest my hand on the crank that holds
her in place, but do not turn it.�
&quot;Talk to us, Wendy!� Tell us
the Truth!&quot;

Wendy's mouth opens, but words do not
come.� Instead, she breathes rapidly as
the pain builds inside her.� I can smell
a singeing, sweet odour, as the sweat between her buttocks evaporates around
the iron spike in her anus.

Wendy jolts.� Her head snaps back, then sinks forward.� She gives a shout.� &quot;Oh Jesus, take me off!� Take me off please, I'm
begging you!� I can't bear it!� Aaah!!&quot;

I can see the faces of our audience;
their eyes shining, hands clasped, as the torture of the chair begins to take
hold.� Wendy's struggles become more
frantic.� Her rectum is beginning to sear
from the heat.� The pain, already bad
even before we started, is now beyond her threshold to endure.

She shrieks.� Her shoulders make loud cracking sounds as
her back-twisted arms are wrenched agonisingly by her struggles.� Her anus, where it clenches around the spike,
is beginning to burn.

Ah, the music of a witch truly
screaming.� Now Wendy is drawing breath
only to yell dementedly in agony, every exhausted muscle straining to rid
herself of the crippling, unbearable pain inside her.� As I see the first signs of smoke curling up
from beneath her buttocks, I grasp the crank handle and turn.

The iron carriage to which Wendy's arms
are shackled rises, drawing her upwards and off the spike.� Her scream mellows into a shrill wail as the
iron seems to slide endlessly out of her ass, steaming.� Her natural internal lubricants allow the
spike's smooth exit, and her head rolls to one side at the incredible relief.

&quot;Oh - oh God - oh God �&quot; she
squeals, panting hard.� I raise her up
until only a few inches of spike are still buried in her rectum, then stop the
handle.

&quot;Names, Wendy.� Tell us names.� Confess your fornications with Satan!&quot;

&quot;I confess!&quot; she wails.� &quot;I had sex with Satan, I was his
whore!� I did it all to him!� I'm sorry, please, please, I admit it, don't torture me any more!&quot;

&quot;What of other witches?&quot;

&quot;I �&quot;� Wendy doesn't know what to say.� Fear screws her face into an expression of
abject suffering as she realises what will�
happen, but she does not give an answer.�
So I turn the handle, cranking her downwards again.

The spike is driven into her
asshole,� hissing and squealing as she is
forced further and further down.� Her
descent is swift, inch after inch sliding into her, and steam escapes from
between her ass cheeks as the hot metal fills her bowels.� Her screams are frantic, maddened with agony,
the chair rattling as she thrashes and struggles.� She can only scream, oblivious to everything
but pain.

I let it burn her for ten terrible
seconds, then turn the handle again, lifting her off the obscene spike.� This time there are unspeakable residues on
the iron, proof that she is taking damage from the torture.� Her body is shuddering with her agony, her
eyes rolling.� She releases a dribble of
urine and it boils and steams in a quickly-evaporating puddle on the iron of
the chair beneath her.

&quot;Talk,&quot; I command.

Wendy's tanned body is wet with sweat,
helplessly held in place by the shackles about her wrists and elbows that cinch
her arms behind her back; her raised breasts and ribcage heave
desperately.� Every muscle is stark with
her pain-maddened struggles.� She sobs and
shrieks but gives no information, so I turn the handle again.

Down Wendy goes; the hissing spike is
again forced into her ass as she is impelled lower and lower by the cruel
chair.� The shrill soprano of her screams
fills the torture chamber.� The coal-heated
spike explores deep into her colon as she is forced down onto it.� This new impaling is a thousand times worse,
as steam is forced up into her lower intestine, bloating it, creating agony
more terrible and debilitating than the pear ever could.� The sheer magnitude� of pain forces the air from Wendy's lungs,
and she simply gasps at the ceiling, her eyes bulging, her body shaking
violently, to the sound of her own intimate parts hissing against hot metal.

Almost at once, I am raising her
again.� Her head drops forward, she
whoops air and then manages to howl in agony as her ass is lifted off the
spike.� Even as the iron slides out of
her, I am shouting again:

&quot;Name your sister witches!� Name
them!� Name
them, or you will have the spike inside you again!&quot;

&quot;Nooooo!&quot; Wendy shrieks in abject horror, and, as I begin to crank her
down again onto the spike, and its searing circumference fills her tortured
rectum once more, she begins to gibber desperately.� &quot;I
know them, I know the names, I just can't remember, I'll give you names, oh
God, don't torture me, I'll give you names!&quot;

The spike is part-way inside her ass,
and I pause.� The agony must be
unbearable, but Wendy, between shrieks and howls, begins spilling out
names.� It is a long list, and none of
them mean a thing to me, until Tina shouts out - 

&quot;Wait!� Did she say Stacy?&quot;

&quot;Witch!&quot;� I shout at Wendy, halting her babbling,
&quot;did you say Stacy?&quot;

&quot;Yes!� Stacy!�
She is a witch too -
aaaahh! - she is, I know it!&quot;

&quot;Stacy Sambilay?&quot; I
demand.� That is one name I have
encountered, and Wendy could be the lead we have been wanting.

&quot;I �&quot;� Wendy looks confused, turns her face to Tina
for prompting, so I crank the handle.�
The spike is glowing at its base now, the metal radiating savage heat,
and as Wendy is forced down upon it, it rends her insides with a horrible
squealing and hissing. �Smoke and steam
billow from beneath her as she is impaled again, and she throws her head about
and shakes her straining shoulders, sweat droplets flung from her body, her
screams shrill and maddened.

The chair fucks Wendy's ass slowly and
deeply with its savage, heated spike while she struggles and screams; when I
raise her off it again, she finally sags, her head rolling forward.� The heat and shock of her ordeal is taking
its toll, and I know she won't last much longer.

&quot;Think, Witch!� Is her last
name Sambilay?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Wendy groans.� &quot;Yes, yes, yes � &quot;

I nod.�
&quot;Very well.&quot;

The torture is over.

I bend to the pail of water by the
chair, and tip it in a cascade over Wendy's sweat-wet body.� She gasps at the chill relief, her skin
coarse with goosebumps, the water splashing and hissing across the iron below
her, taking the edge off its cruel heat.

&quot;Guards, we are done here,&quot; I
say.� &quot;Take the witch off the chair
and return her to her cell.� I will send
a physician to tend her.&quot;

As Wendy falls into a faint, Oberon,
Tina, Austin and Steve nod approval.� I
allow myself a wary smile and for the first time realise that my own body is
wet with perspiration.� This was as much
a test of my own performance, as it was the chair's.� But the accused witch has confessed, and has
named another; it is all we need.

&nbsp;

Execution day. My outfit says don't fuck with me in big, bold letters.

A black leather bustier, lace-up in
front, pushing my breasts into pouting, teasing mounds, and leaving my midriff
exposed.� And a long black silk
sarong-skirt, split on the left so that my whole leg is effectively left naked,
giving the lucky few an occasional glimpse of the black leather thong bikini
underneath.� High heeled sandals.� It feels dangerously sexy � and, judging by
the enthusiastic applause that rises up from the thousand-odd spectators
filling the amphitheatre as I climb onto the scaffold, it looks pretty damn
good too.

I stand alongside the chopping-block
upon the wooden scaffold.� But Wendy will
not be granted the mercy of beheading.�
It has been made clear already that her execution will be lengthy and
agonising.

Not fifty feet away, Steve is arranging
the last of the wood and straw around the stake at which Wendy will finally
die. Nine feet tall, surrounded with a low scattering of wood bedded on brush
and kindling. High on the stake, a single bolt has been fixed, from which
dangle two short chains, open manacles at their ends. Those, and only those,
will be her restraint for execution. Nearby stands a brazier in which coals lazily
burn, and a tar-soaked torch to light her pyre.

Beside me on the torture scaffold, iron
implements shimmer in the heat of a brazier.�
Its warmth wards off the autumn chill from my bare limbs.

Over at the Chateau, the main doors
swing open, and the execution party emerges. My dungeon assistant Zell heads
half a dozen guards; in the midst of them is Wendy.� She is stark naked; her wrists are roped
tightly behind her back, her head is down and her face is streaked with tears.
She hobbles badly, one foot injured by torture, and her more delicate parts
scorched and raw from her suffering upon my Chair. At the rear of the group
comes Austin, his bear-like form swathed in robes.

Wendy's eyes find the high scaffold
quickly, and alight on me.� I see fear on
her face for just an instant, before it is replaced by hatred.� She mouths a curse at me, but I simply
smile.� She can curse me all she wants; I
will be watching her die.

Seeing that Wendy is finally being
brought to her execution, the spectators give voice to their excitement; a
surge of applause, calls and cheers, shouts of abuse.� Her complicity with the Witchseeker General
Oberon has raised her to the status of Villain amongst the members of the
Witchseeker group, and all are eager to finally see her face justice.

As the execution party reaches the
bottom of the steps, I pick up a cat o'nine tails.� It is heavy; from its stout handle, the
yard-long lashes swing, each made of hard, braided leather into which platinum
wires have been woven.� Adding to its
weight, while letting the lashes move freely.

Wendy struggles as they reach the top
of the steps, and her eyes settle first on the whip in my hands, then on the
implements heating in the brazier.�
Finally, she looks at me, the fear obvious in her eyes.� &quot;Just burn me, you sadistic bitch!&quot;
she hisses.

&quot;And deprive everyone of a good
show?� I don't think so.&quot;� To Zell I order, &quot;secure her for the
whip.&quot;

The gallows doubles as a whipping-post:
the rope dangling from it today is far more slender than a hangman's. Zell
unties Wendy's wrists from behind her back.�
Her arms are quickly brought in front of her, re-bound, then lifted to
the free end of the rope.� It is fastened
about her wrist bonds, and two guards loosen the other end of the rope from its
iron stay.� They make short work of
pulling it through the high metal ring, so that Wendy's arms are wrenched up
over her head.� Her face briefly shows
pain as the rope bites into her wrist bones, and by her wrists, she is drawn up
onto her tiptoes. 

Wolf whistles. Shouts. Secured like
this is immensely flattering to Wendy's body, drawing her lean and long; her
ribcage and breasts are lifted, her belly hollowed, her back gracefully curved
to the taut swell of her buttocks, her thighs and calves defined.� From this close, I can see the rapid shifting
of her ribcage.� And in the cold air, I
can see the goosebumps on her naked body.�
With deliberate tenderness, I collect a simple hair-tie from Zell and,
standing behind Wendy, secure her blonde hair into a ponytail.

I whisper, &quot;so that it doesn't get
in the way of the whip.&quot;

With Wendy prepared, I let her
half-hang there while I turn to address the crowd, raising my hand for their
attention.

&quot;I will not bother to read aloud
the official charges against Wendy,&quot; I tell them, &quot;since they are
widely known.� She is a confessed witch,
she conspired with Oberon to burn her innocent cousin, and she has done her
best to spread dissent through the group.�
Her crimes are many, and today she will be punished for them.&quot;

I continue.� &quot;Wendy will be given thirty strokes of
the whip, after which her sinning flesh will be purified with red-hot iron,
before she is burned alive at the stake.&quot;

Wendy must have known what awaited
her.� But hearing it, her head drops
forward and she releases her breath in a groan of despair.� Her crimson hands close into fists above the
binding ropes.

I find my position on the boards behind
her, swish the whip in my hand a few times to measure the distance.

&quot;Whip her hard!&quot; I hear from
the crowd.

&quot;Flay her alive!&quot; 

I throw the first lash.� Whistling, the cat lands hard across Wendy's
smooth upper back, and she is thrown forward, giving a shriek of pain.� I give her a few moments; the strike of the
lash is an intense, severe, crippling pain that briefly flares and grows worse
before it eases.� Then I strike
again.� The sound is almost as sharp as
the ringing crack of a single-lash; but I know that each of those braided tails
brings its own line of hot agony.

Wendy shrieks again, and then comes the
sweat.� It is a basic physiological
response to intense pain; the heartbeat increases, the adrenaline flows, and
sweat appears.� I see it emerge onto
Wendy's naked flesh in tiny, clustered dewdrops after only a few strokes of the
whip.� The next lash raises a fine spray
into the air.

����������� &quot;Oh God, stop!&quot; Wendy screams in her pain.

I make each stroke count, flinging the
lash with all of my strength, in a slow progression from the backs of her shoulders,
down her slender back, towards the top of her buttocks.� Each blow of the whip leaves a score of tiny
welts, as if her skin has been lightly trailed with a scalpel.

When I have given her ten strokes of
the cat, I step back.� Wendy is hanging
heavily in the ropes, her head forward, her body gleaming, her ribcage
heaving.� Rivulets of blood trail down
her back.

Zell is next to take the whip. He bows
his head gracefully to me, positions himself behind Wendy, then slices low. The
leather braids cut across the back of Wendy's thighs, and she shrieks, picking
her feet up off the scaffold and swinging freely on the rope. The crowd gives a
cheer of approval.

&quot;Mercy!� Please!&quot; Wendy shrieks.� 

But Zell will not be stopped.� He whips Wendy's bare legs; her thighs, her
calves, her feet, the lashes curl around her like serpents, leaving welts that
encircle her legs.� The pain must be
hideous, and Wendy cries and shrieks with each blow.

The second ten lashes are delivered,
and Zell hands the whip to Austin.� 

Swiftly, Austin casts off the heavy
robes, to reveal black executioner's trousers and a bare torso.� A powerful and muscular man.� He swings the lash to test it a few times,
then, moving to stand in front of Wendy, aims it for her breasts.� There is a whistling sound as the whip
swings, then the sharp impact as the wire-braided leather lands on the firm
globes of her breasts; hitting them with such force that they bounce
upwards.� Again, then again he lashes her
breasts, and Wendy can only scream.

Austin spares a few strokes for Wendy's
undefended belly, angling the lash across her naked hips, but it is her breasts
that suffer the most, and when he is finished, they are almost cut to ribbons,
blood running down her ribcage.

Wendy hangs in the ropes, sobbing in
agony, her body bloody and striped from the whipping.

&quot;Bring her down,&quot; I order.

The rope is freed from its stay, and
Wendy collapses, a sweating, tortured wretch, into the arms of the guards.� They free her wrists from the binding rope,
but at once re-tie them behind her back. This time, a rope is also passed about
her elbows, wrenching them together into a cruel restraint, preventing her from
struggling.� Her whip-scored breasts are
forced high and proud on her arched ribcage.

&quot;Lay her on the block!&quot;

Wendy is made to lie on her own bound
arms, across the chopping block.� Her
head is held back, arching her naked body like a bow, with her breasts
uppermost.� Her nipples stand upright in
the chill air, in defiance of the cruel whipping Austin gave.� The position is painful, and she can barely
breathe; but that is the least of her worries.

I pull on a heavy gauntlet.

&quot;Now,&quot; I call to the crowd,
&quot;let the iron punish her flesh.&quot;

I draw a heavy set of pliers from the
brazier.� Their end glows a vicious
orange, the very outline of the metal seems to be soft-focus with intense
heat.� I can feel its warmth on my bare
skin.� I move to the block over which
Wendy is bowed, and look down on her heaving, helpless breasts.

&quot;This,&quot; I say, &quot;is for
your impertinence.&quot;

&quot;Oh God, no-o-o!!&quot;

As the pliers close on her left nipple,
it seems to explode.� With a loud pop, a burst of steam jets from her nipple.� Then Wendy is screaming, struggling, agonised
as smoke rises up from her searing nipple.�
I twist the pliers about, corkscrewing her breast for almost a full
minute, until the pliers unexpectedly come free.� A black, smoking wound marks where her nipple
used to be; the remains of her sensitive flesh smoke as an oily residue on the
pliers themselves.

I return them to the brazier and draw
out a fresh set of pliers.� Again they
shimmer and crackle in the air. 

&quot;Kirsten, I beg you!� Don't, please!� Forgive me!&quot; Wendy shrieks as I draw
near.� But I am not interested in her
false words and pleas, and I crush the pliers onto her right nipple.� The squealing and hissing of her burning
flesh is joined by her shrill and agonised screaming, and in half a minute her
right nipple is but a charred remnant.

&quot;Reposition her,&quot; I say.

I have never heard a woman beg as
desperately as Wendy begs now. Turned onto her front, she is bent over the
chopping block with her naked ass in the air, her legs held apart. The intimate
anatomy of her vulva and anus are presented to the sky, open and
vulnerable.� 

&quot;Kirsten, don't, oh God,
don't do it, don't, please, don't do it �&quot;�
On and on.

I draw out, first, the most slender
iron.� It glows with heat.� I know Wendy's rectum still suffers the
wounds of her time on the Chair; now I will finish its job.

&quot;This,&quot; I tell her, &quot;is
for your treachery.&quot;

&quot;Oh no - no, no, please,
no!!&quot; Wendy shrieks.� Her little brown sphincter twitches in dread
and anticipation.

I touch the tip of the iron to her
hole.� It burns and squeals and Wendy
screams; then I plunge the poker deep inside.�
Wendy's scream erupts into a long, shattering howl of agony as steam
bursts out around the iron, her rectum searing and burning.� Her body thrashes and strains in the
grip� of the guards, but she is utterly
helpless.� She can only feel the agony,
and scream and scream.� The crowd cheers
and roars.

When I pull the iron free, it brings
the smoking char of her flesh with it.�
Even if she were not to be executed, her wounds now would eventually be
fatal.� 

But it is not over.

Wendy lies there, her body shuddering
and heaving air, sobbing, her body so wet with sweat that it looks as if she
has been hosed down.� Steam rises from
her naked flesh in the cool air. With her elbows roped together and her wrists
bound, she cannot struggle, but her fingers are curled into little claws of
suffering.

I draw out the thicker, heavier
iron.� It shimmers and smokes, orange-hot
and savagely crackling.

&quot;This,&quot; I announce, &quot;is
for your complicity with Oberon.&quot;

With the tip of the iron, first, I
touch Wendy's clitoris.� She gives
terrible shrieks as her most secret place blisters and burns. I lift the iron,
then plunge its entire fiery length into her vagina.� The crowd gives a mighty cheer of approval as
Wendy bellows in utter agony.� Steam and
smoke curl up into the air.

When I tear out the iron, Wendy falls
into a half-faint.� Smoke still rises
from between her legs, but I order the guards to prepare her for the final
stage: her tongue, which formed so many treacherous words, but also gave Oberon
pleasure.

On her back again, with her head
resting on the chopping block, Wendy is helpless as the guards force her mouth
open and hold it for me.� I prepare the
final iron.

&quot;This is for all your lying and
deceit,&quot; I tell her.

Wendy's eyes bulge and she makes
incoherent noises.� But I put the red-hot
iron inside her mouth and press it down onto her tongue, and she screams and
howls around the cloud of steam that billows up from her mouth.� The traitorous witch will speak no more.

I shove the iron back into the brazier.

&quot;Secure her at the stake and let
her hang there until dusk,&quot; I order.

Wendy is barely conscious as they carry
her down from the scaffold and drag her to the tall wooden stake. Even her
restraint is unusually cruel: she is lifted up, so that her slim wrists can be
enclosed in the shackles, leaving her hanging naked against the wooden post,
her toes dangling a foot above the wood-pile. Her head droops onto her chest,
her body shining and motionless.

The crowd disperses.� Oberon and Tina are taken quickly back to
their cells beneath the Chateau.� I post
half a dozen guards to watch over Wendy.

&nbsp;

I know, as dusk begins to fall and the
crowd returns to watch the evening burning, that Wendy will be anticipating
death as much as she dreads it.� The pain
of the hot irons has not ebbed as the hours crept by, nor that of the lashes on
her body.� In moments of near-delirium
she may well have imagined herself whole again, free again, with a life still
ahead of her.� But the choices she made
have instead led her here, to this.

It is cold, and still in my two-piece
outfit, I shuffle as close as I dare to the straw and wood scattered below
Wendy's dangling feet, hoping for a little warmth once it is lit.� There is no ceremony, no announcement; Steve
simply brings a burning torch from the brazier and touches it to points around
the circle of tinder.� Fluttering and
dipping in the cool breeze, the little flames scatter and spread and climb on
their slow, lazy trek towards the gleaming figure that hangs from the tall
post.

����������� The
fire grows, clambering up through the dry branches, translucent veils of grey
smoke drifting up.� Sparks float up on
the warm currents of air, sap pops and crackles.� 

����������� � I can barely begin to imagine what Wendy is
going through, during these long, long minutes while the fire grows. The
humiliation of being hung up by her wrists before a huge crowd, knowing that
she is soon to be in unbearable pain, knowing that she is soon to begin dying -
and that her death is what the throngs have come to see.

I can see the gleam of nervous sweat
amidst the week�s stubble in her underarms. I can see every intimate detail of
her terror in the downwards-curl of her mouth, the quivering of her lips as she
battles the urge to scream out her misery.�
Her eyes search the crowd, a mixture of hatred and pleading; she loathes
them all, but she would give anything for one of them to douse the flames whose
smoke now spirals and teases around her helpless body.� The growing fire is reflected in her
sweat-polished skin.

I feel the warmth as the flames crackle
and whoosh ever-higher. Their heat begins to sear Wendy's nude body, and she
moans aloud. With a long-handled rake, Steve guides and nurtures the fire,
making sure the flames stay low, and it is not until fifteen minutes after the
fire was lit that the first little razor tongues lick at Wendy's dangling toes.

She is too weak from her tortures to
struggle or lift her legs, but she is not too weak to feel, and as her skin
shrinks back, as the oils ignite, she finds her full voice again. The piercing
screams of her agony ring out across the amphitheatre, met by cheering and
shouts from the crowd.

The fire remains low; her feet and
ankles burn slowly while her naked legs blister and sear. �The scant triangle of her pubic hair chars
rather than flames, and the sweat steams lazily from her suspended body as the
air around her shimmers.

&quot;Burn, Witch!&quot; I hear from
the crowd.

&quot;You get what you deserve!&quot;
comes another cry.

Wendy still screams out in her agony
and misery: despite her suffering, she doesn't want to die.� But she can feel the flesh-tearing horror of
fire stealing her life away, minute by agonising minute, and her terror at what
waits beyond the gaping maw of death enters her screams.

Steve lets the fire climb a little
higher, so that the flames flay and gnaw at her lower legs, her thighs
glistening with oils drawn from the skin, her belly and breasts polished.� But even after half an hour, she is not dead.

Her screams ring out as Steve adds
fuel. The hungry fire eats at her buttocks, and I wince as the slow-burning
flames corkscrew up around her pubic mound. The iron already destroyed her most
intimate parts, but now fire eats what remains, agonising tongues that lick
into every crease and crevice, tear away her womanhood and pare her to the
bone.

Her hands drawn down hard into the
now-blackening manacles, Wendy hangs screaming in the fire, insane with agony,
her screams broken and harsh. Flames curl and flutter in the small of her back,
lick up her shining sides, cauterising the myriad wounds laid open in her flesh
by the whip. Her already-tortured breasts are cupped by fire, until they seem
to melt.

Still she screams.� Flames are leaping now at her arms, licking
and blistering her armpits and curling around her shoulders, and then her hair
catches alight.� It is a brilliant flare,
as hair burns; Wendy flings her head back and forth, shrieking madly in pain,
and I hear the thunk of her skull hitting the stake again and again. The flames
char her scalp, and wrap around her naked arms, the steam of vaporising sweat
joining the smoke that now coils up from her twisting body.

Her feet are charring deeply; I hear
the distinctive pops of bones splitting. Her lower legs, too, have burned to the
bone, the natural oils have turned her flesh into a candle that feeds the
flames consuming her. I hear the deep cracking sounds of her leg-bones
bursting, and she hangs screaming in the midst of the inferno, still throwing
her head about, but now completely engulfed.

More than an hour after she first felt
the fire, Wendy finally loses her voice to it.�
Suspended by her wrists in the inferno, engulfed, devoured. The shimmering
wall of flame and smoke obscure her hanging, writhing figure; now only Wendy's
fingers can express the utter agony that still enfolds her.� They spread and stretch above the manacles,
as if reaching for salvation.

Then there is only the roaring of the
flames, the squealing and hissing of burning flesh. Her body is alight, her
once-perfect breasts exploding in a gruesome burst of hot fat that scatters
some in the crowd, and they jump back with shouts and laughter.

Finally, Wendy's shaking fingers curl over,
the flesh reddening as flames finally reach them.� Then there is no more movement, and as the
minutes pass, the likelihood grows that the witch has died.

Into the night, the dead witch's body
continues to burn, like a slow candle, until, piece by piece, it falls into the
ashes and is consumed to nothing.

Justice has been done.

Part 6 - Kirsten on the Wheel

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Witchseekers personal journal entry, Wheel
Experiment

&nbsp;

����������� I
am, naturally, anxious about my experience on the wheel rack.

����������� It
is an instrument of torture after all, and I have volunteered to experience
it.� The logic is that, through better
understanding of the victim and the stages of psychological and physical
distress through which she goes, I can become a more effective interrogator -
able to gain confessions and information with minimal damage to the prisoner. 

When Zell greets me in the private dungeon,
little more than a musty cave hewn from the bedrock beneath the Chateau, known
to almost no-one but ourselves, I am shivering with more than just the cold and
damp.� Even so, I pull my silk dressing
gown a little closer around my body.

����������� Zell
is dressed more appropriately for the dungeon climate.� A heavy grey robe drapes his form, its hood
over his head.� I have no idea what he
wears beneath, but I can only envy his warmth.

����������� &quot;This
way, Mistress Kirsten,&quot; he says with enthusiasm.

����������� Lit
by torches on the walls, the wheel rack stands in the middle of the dungeon. on
a raised stone plinth, a macabre shrine to suffering and torture.

����������� It
is just under six feet in diameter, although its slight elevation on wooden
supports from its heavy base adds a little height.� It is crafted with skill; a thick, solid,
heavily-studded rim mounted on heavy cross-beam spokes.� It is turned by an iron cog, in turn operated
by a ratcheted lever.

����������� The
&quot;rim&quot; of the wheel, the curved surface of its circumference, is
nearly three feet wide.� Near the upper
curve are bolted two lengths of chain, ending in open manacles.� To the wooden base, immediately below the
foremost extreme of the wheel's rim, two more chains and manacles.

����������� &quot;Shit,&quot;
I mutter.� It is terrifying to see the
wheel rack up close.� The iron studs in
particular look gruesome and forbidding.

����������� &quot;This
rack is turned by a simple gearing mechanism,&quot; Zell explains happily.� &quot;An easy movement of the lever � thus � causes the wheel to shift about one half of a
degree, effecting a stretch of one third of an inch.&quot;� He cranks the lever to demonstrate, and the
big wheel groans, turns fractionally.�
&quot;So, should we get started?&quot;

����������� My
heart thumps.� &quot;But we haven't
discussed a safe word!&quot;

����������� Zell
rolls his eyes.� &quot;What do you want
with one of those?� It's so � so � so
�&quot;

����������� &quot;Safe?&quot;
I try.

����������� &quot;Exactly!� How about we decide on a number of
turns?� No more than, say, twenty.&quot;

����������� Quick
mental calculation. �More than six inches.� Jesus!� &quot;I want a safe word,&quot; I insist.

&quot;Fine,&quot; Zell sighs, leaning against
the wheel.� &quot;What should it be?� How about, 'eeee - aaaahh -
aaiiiiieee'?&quot;

&quot;'Eeee ahh aaiiiiieee?'&quot;

&quot;Eeee aaaahh
aaiiiiieee,&quot; Zell corrects.� &quot;It has to be right, or I won't
stop.&quot;

&quot;That's crazy!� We'll go with something sensible, but
something I wouldn't ordinarily say under torture.� How about I
tap out?&quot;

&quot;'I tap out'?� That's the best you can do?&quot;

&quot;When I'm this nervous, yes!&quot;

&quot;Then I suggest the word 'yellow,'&quot;
Zell says. 

There is no mistaking the look in his
eyes.� I know Zell has had a crush on me
since he arrived � it's one of the reasons I trust him more than any of the
others � but his disdain for the idea of a safe-word is obvious.� I feel utterly embarrassed as I accept the
label of cowardice.� &quot;'Yellow' it
is, then.&quot;

Zell gestures towards the looming monster on
its plinth.� &quot;Shall we get
started?&quot;

I nod.

Here goes.�
I feel sweat prickling along my hairline,
down my spine.� My heart is pounding
almost painfully.� My throat is suddenly
dry.� I remind myself to remain
objective, to absorb each little sensation � the fear, the near panic � and to
remember it, so that I can exploit it when I have a witch to interrogate.� Knowledge is power, and when I understand the
victim, I can break her so much more effectively.

With shaking fingers, I undo the silk tie of
my gown, and let the garment slide like liquid from my shoulders.� It trails itself over my body as it falls
away, and Zell's eyes automatically stray downwards; to the small swells of my
breasts.� My cinnamon nipples react to
the cold in the predictable way, stiffening and swelling so that they stand out
embarrassingly.� Much to Zell's obvious
delight.

He continues his scrutiny; following the line
of my arms, my naked belly, the fluffy thatch of my pubic hair within the
cradle of my hips, the soft muscularity of my legs.

&quot;Wow,&quot; he says.� &quot;Mistress, you are even more beautiful
than I imagined!&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;I will be an honour indeed to stretch
you.&quot;

It takes every last ounce of courage not to
run straight for the door.� Instead, I
take Zell's hand as he guides me up onto the stone plinth, and makes me stand
in place alongside the big wheel.� Its
iron-studded curve brushes my shoulder blades icily.� Zell kneels at my feet, gathers up one of the
manacles, and fits it around my ankle.

It is a long time since I have worn a
shackle.� I am immediately reminded of
its heaviness, the solid metal weighty and cold against my skin. Zell locks it
shut, fastening it with a small padlock, and lets it drop; it rests against my
ankle bone and the top of my foot.� He
places the second shackle around my other ankle, locks it, checks the chains.

My feet are now secured to the wooden base.

Gently, Zell holds out his hand again for
mine.� I take his hand gingerly, and he
lifts my left wrist to the open manacle, which lies against the curve of the
wheel.� He closes the thick, cold iron
around my wrist and locks it, again with a small padlock.� He does the same with my right wrist, and as
the padlock clicks shut, I feel a fresh prickle of sweat over my body.� With my arms slightly raised, I am now
completely helpless, utterly in Zell's power.

I automatically grasp the chains that run
upwards from the wrist manacles.� My toes
curl and rub against the wood beneath them.�
I am acutely conscious of my nakedness, my vulnerability.� I am aware of how fragile my flesh must seem,
alongside the heavy mechanisms of the wheel rack.

Click - beep.

I lift my�
head.� &quot;Zell!� What are you doing?&quot;

Zell looks at me over his digital camera,
then glances again at its little screen as he lines up another shot.� &quot;For posterity, Mistress.� Forgive me, I cannot resist!&quot;� Another photo.

&quot;Zell, stop that!&quot;

Zell bows slightly.� &quot;As you wish.&quot;� He tucks the camera into the folds of his
robe, and instead steps up onto the plinth again, going to the wooden handle of
the wheel rack.� He grasps the lever, but
instead of turning it, simply agitates it back and forth slightly, drawing deep
clanking sounds
from the ratchet mechanism.� It sends a
wave of anticipation through me, so intense that it seems to burn inside my
belly.� My heart feels like a fluttering
bird in my chest.� I move my hands a
little, the chains knocking on the wood above my head.

&quot;Tell me how you feel, Mistress
Kirsten?&quot;

&quot;I'm okay.&quot;� I don't know what he wants to hear, but I
find the question somehow humiliating.

����������� Zell
pulls the lever.

����������� The
wheel groans, creaks, and shifts, and I feel the chains draw on my wrists.� Another notch.� Then another.�
Little by little, as the wheel rotates, my hands inch higher.� Click,
click, click � �the
anticipation deepens into a kind of dread as I begin to experience the slow,
inexorable progress of the turning rack.��� 


����������� As
my wrists are drawn upwards, they are also drawn backwards, following the curve
of the wheel.� It arches me back, so that
the cold iron studs dig uncomfortably into my back and shoulders.� My spine begins to extend, my breasts
lifting, my belly hollowing, my armpits and ribcage exposed, and my sense of
helplessness grows with my discomfort.

����������� &quot;Wow
� this is quite an experience,&quot; I say, trying to sound brave, as my
manacled wrists creep up, above and behind my head.� The wheel continues to creak and groan as
Zell cranks the handle without hurry.

����������� &quot;What
do you feel now, Mistress?&quot;

����������� &quot;Anticipation.� Vulnerability.� Fear.&quot;

����������� A
fraction of an inch at a time, my arms are drawn to their full extent over my
head.� My back arches more severely as my
body follows the curve of the wheel, my shoulders, shoulder blades, lower back
and now buttocks all pressed against the cruel iron studs, while my legs extend
straight down.� With the next few
notches, my heels rise off the platform, so that I am standing on the balls of
my feet.� It is very uncomfortable, even
the mere act of breathing causes the studs in my back to painfully press into
my flesh.� The manacles are biting into
my wrists.

����������� Zell
stops winding the handle, and steps down from the stone plinth.� He takes out the camera again, lines up some
careful shots.

����������� &quot;With
your permission, Mistress?&quot;

����������� &quot;Okay,
fine,&quot; I concede.� I am no longer so
concerned about the photos; it may be interesting to have such documentation of
my session.� I am here, after all, to
learn.

����������� Despite
that knowledge, it is hard not to feel afraid.�
A droplet of sweat slides down the arch of my ribcage from one
underarm.� My whole body feels
unnaturally strained already.� It is an
effort even to lift my head.� My arms,
although not truly stretched, are feeling the pressure of my body's weight.

����������� Zell
finally says, &quot;Mistress, upon the wheel rack, you look more beautiful than
words can express.� It fills me with a
desire that threatens to drive me insane.&quot;

����������� &quot;Well
just hang on to that sanity, eh?&quot; I suggest in a shaky voice.� &quot;I'm kind of relying on you for
that.&quot;

����������� Zell
says nothing more, but smiles, and returns to the lever.

����������� I
close my eyes.

����������� The
wheel shifts as he hauls on the lever, and on its studded rim, I am lifted a
little further by my shackled wrists.� My
body, curved backwards, stretches a little under the gentle urge of gravity;
but I know there are much crueller forces waiting to act upon it.� Another notch, and I am on tiptoes.� My legs are at full stretch.� I can feel the muscles of my calves knotting
with the strain.� The iron manacles seem
to burn into my wrist bones, my hands tingling.

����������� Zell
draws the lever again.� The wheel groans,
and my toes clear the ground.� For the
first time, I am half-suspended over the circumference of the wheel.� It draws a grunt from my throat.� The studs in my back and the iron on my
wrists are painful, the arching of my back a considerable discomfort also.� Another notch, and with ease, the wheel lifts
my body back-and-up on its arc.� I can
feel the weight of the fetters and chains hanging off my ankles.� The position is seriously uncomfortable to
the extent of being a battle to endure.

����������� I
flex my toes, trying to reach the ground as Zell cranks the lever again.� I cannot touch it.� Looking down, I can only see my own naked
chest, my breasts drawn almost flat into my ribcage, but my nipples jutting
like fat berries into the air.� The curve
of my body is such that I can see no further without lifting my head.

����������� Another
notch, and I feel, for the first time, the tug of the manacles on my
ankles.� It is only subtle, but enough to
tell me that the chains have drawn taut.�
My toes must be at least six inches off the ground.� The discomfort through my arched body is
severe.

����������� &quot;What
is my beautiful Mistress feeling at this moment?&quot; Zell asks, his hand
waiting on the lever.

����������� &quot;Some
pain,&quot; I say.� My breath is short
from the strain of my position.�
&quot;Fear, still.� And I feel
exposed � very vulnerable �&quot;

����������� &quot;Your
words fuel my desire so!&quot; Zell sighs, and pulls on the lever.

����������� The
rack begins its work.

����������� The
manacles on my wrists haul my hands a fraction of an inch further, while the
manacles and chains on my ankles hold my feet in place.� Tension translates all along my arms, my
spine, and down my legs; the tension of a yoga stretch.

����������� &quot;Ahh�&quot;� It is only a forced release of breath from the awkwardness of my
arched position, but it prompts Zell to take his hand from the lever.

����������� &quot;I
believe it is traditional at this point,&quot; he says, &quot;to let the witch
dwell on her pending agonies for a time?&quot;

����������� &quot;That
would be right,&quot; I agree readily.�
&quot;But � we can skip that, okay?&quot;

����������� Zell
looks disappointed.� &quot;Okay
...&quot;� Instead, he takes out his
camera again, and takes a dozen high-resolution shots.� Close-ups, full-body shots, from different
angles and vantage points.� I am his
helpless subject, arched over the wheel, locked in an instinctive battle
against the strain, the pain of the iron studs in my flesh.

Zell finishes with his photos.� &quot;Before we continue, Mistress, please
just give me two minutes; I have to go to the bathroom.&quot;

����������� &quot;Okay
� but hurry back,&quot; I grunt.�
&quot;This is really uncomfortable!&quot;

����������� The
dungeon door thuds shut.� I hear the clunk of its bar sliding into
place.

����������� Then,
silence.� Utter and absolute.

����������� I
am naked and cold, half-hanging across the curve of the wheel, shackled at
wrists and ankles and mildly stretched.�
And utterly, completely helpless.�
The iron studs dig into my back, but I cannot move to relieve their
painful pressure, nor can I ease the hot bite of iron on my wrists and
ankles.� I can only endure.

����������� 

����������� Minutes
pass.� I do not have any way of gauging
time, but I know it has been more than two.�
It has been more than five.� And still no hint that
Zell is returning.� The pain is growing
worse as time passes and the cold gnaws into my body; I am fighting the urge to
shiver, which would only make things worse.

����������� Minute
after slow minute.

����������� I
estimate ten minutes have passed when I begin to wonder if Zell will
return.� Fuck, what if he doesn't?� I can't possibly get free � I know that already.� Even so, I tip my head back, an effort in
itself, and look towards my own shackled wrists.� The heavy iron sits snugly around my wrists,
locked shut with the padlocks.� I could
not, in a thousand lifetimes, free myself.

����������� &quot;Zell!&quot;� 

����������� My
voice barely even reverberates in the dungeon enclosure, muted by the thick
bedrock from which it is hewn.� I doubt
that it would even be heard beyond the door; let alone along the narrow
fifty-foot tunnel that leads to another heavy wooden door, beyond which is
labyrinthine gloom of the Chateau's dungeons.�
I could scream and yell, but I would never be heard.� Nobody but Zell knows I am here - and nobody
ever comes in here by chance.

����������� &quot;Ze-e-ell!!&quot;

����������� Unexpectedly,
panic arrives.� It is overwhelming.� My heart-rate surges.� The sweat bursts from every pore.� The adrenaline pounds and gives my muscles
new strength; the pain of my strained position is immediately forgotten.� I begin thrashing as much as I can, which
amounts to little more than tensing my arms, and waggling my feet slightly
against the tension of the chains.� I
twist and turn my hands in the manacles, reaching my fingers for the padlocks;
I catch the lock on my left wrist-manacle between two fingers, but all I am
able to do is tug at it feebly.

����������� So
I grit my teeth and put even more effort into it.� Every last ounce of my strength, until my
muscles are pronounced and hard with straining, my limbs shaking in the effort
to pull myself free - even though I know, as a torturer myself, that I will not escape.� The iron studs bite and press into my flesh,
only bringing more pain.

����������� I am helpless.

����������� The
panic ebbs as quickly as it began, but it is replaced by anger.� Zell�
has betrayed my trust - and there isn't a thing I can do about it,
except wait for him to come back.�
&quot;Zell, you insubordinate shit!�
I'll have your balls for this!&quot; I snarl at the ceiling.� At the same time, I realise how pathetic that
must sound, coming from a woman arched naked over a wheel rack.

����������� I
brood and hold on to my anger for longer; maybe forty minutes.� Maybe more than an hour.� But even that eventually dissipates, until
there is nothing left but the chill eating into my bones, the iron studs boring
into my flesh, the shackles eating into my wrists and ankles, and the ache of
fatigue eating into my muscles. 

����������� I
knew that pain would come.� I have
observed it a hundred times in victims of the rack, and suspension.� But in my earlier panic and then anger, I had
forgotten about it.� Now, though, more
than an hour after Zell left me alone down here, it begins to gnaw at me.� My back is hurting.� Not just the flesh where the iron studs are
digging.� But a deep pain in my spine, in
the muscles of my shoulders and lower back.�
In the tendons.� Being arched
backwards for such a long time is an unnatural and forced position, and my body
is feeling it.

����������� It
is the same with my arms.� They
ache.� The muscles, the joints, the
tendons.� A dull, deep ache, as if there
are bone-deep bruises.� Only my legs,
stretching down towards the ankle manacles, are relatively free of pain.

����������� I
have lost count of the minutes.� But it
seems that at least another hour crawls by, and I remain secured on the wheel
rack, helpless, and in silence.� Down
here, it is cold; barely sixty degrees Fahrenheit, and the chill seems to eat
into my helpless body.� My nipples stand
hard on my flattened chest.� Goosebumps
texture my bare skin.� My teeth start to
chatter.� But I am helpless.

����������� Perhaps
another hour passes.� Perhaps two� hours.�
Perhaps only half an hour.

����������� I
have no way of knowing.� It feels like an
eternity.� I begin to feel detached from
the real world, detached from my own identity.�
Being like this, arched and naked on a device of torture, I am reminded
that all I really have in this world is my own body.� And even that, even the temple of my flesh
and blood, can be ripped apart.

����������� Time
creeps. 

����������� I
am in a numb daze when I hear sounds.� A
rattling at the dungeon door.� The bar is
drawn, and I hear the door creak open.

����������� &quot;How
do you feel now, Mistress
Kirsten?&quot;�  Zell enters, re-locking the door behind him, then stepping up onto
the plinth.� &quot;You look cold,&quot;
he says, noting my chattering teeth, my bullet-hard nipples.� 

����������� &quot;You
left me alone,&quot; I shiver in a weak voice.�
&quot;Why did you do that?&quot;

����������� &quot;Forgive
me, Mistress.� I simply mean to make your
experience authentic.&quot;

����������� &quot;Take
me off, now, Zell.� Please.&quot;� Fatigue and pain have drained my tolerance
for this experiment completely, and all I want is to get out of here.

����������� &quot;No,
Mistress.&quot;

����������� Zell
looks straight into my eyes.� I look into
his.� There is absolute seriousness in
his tone.� Is he playing the game?� Or
is this for real?� I am suddenly more scared than I have ever been.� There is only one way to find out: to say the
safe-word.� But to do that would be to
end the experience now, even before the rack had truly started to turn, and it
would defeat the very purpose of this exercise.

����������� His words are not a denial, they are a challenge.� I turn my face from his.

����������� &quot;Then
do what you must,&quot; I say.

����������� Zell
moves to the lever of the wheel rack.� I
have already tested my restraints many times, and I know myself truly helpless,
but my heart quickens with an impulse to try and escape as he grasps its stout
wood.

����������� &quot;Confess
that you are a witch,&quot; Zell says.

����������� &quot;I
am not,&quot; I say.

����������� Zell
pulls the lever.� The mechanism of the
rack groans, the wheel shifts, and as my body is wrenched upwards, my legs feel
the stretch most, as they pull against the ankle manacles.� He finds another notch, and with the wheel's
next shift, I feel a hot, burning pain deep in my hips, mirrored by pain in my
lower back.

����������� I
feel my head move suddenly with the sharpness of pain.� &quot;Oh, that hurts!&quot;

����������� &quot;How
much?&quot;

����������� &quot;Like
a strong cramp.&quot;

����������� &quot;Not
bad!&quot;� Zell seems impressed.� &quot;So, do you confess?&quot;

����������� &quot;Not
yet, Zell -&quot; I warn, and he turns the rack again.

����������� I
am stretched, and a fiery pain fills my hips and lower back, and seems to
spread up my spine.� I feel it in my
shoulders, now, too; quickly overshadowing the pain of the manacles and the
iron studs that dig into my flesh.� The
pain of being stretched is far more intense, like fire along my bones.

����������� &quot;Ohh!!� Zell!&quot; I gasp.� &quot;I meant 'don't turn it yet!'� I was trying to - uhh - adjust to the
pain!&quot;

����������� &quot;I
understand, Mistress,&quot; Zell says, and cranks me another notch.� The wheel creaks, but I also hear my own
spine pop, and hot pain flashes along my back, down through my legs.� It seems to tear up through my shoulders,
too, and I give an involuntary groan.

����������� &quot;Zell,
please, stop, stop for a
moment!� God, it really hurts now!&quot;

����������� &quot;So
you confess?&quot;

����������� &quot;Seriously,
Zell, it hurts!&quot;� I can feel my
body's response to pain, now; sudden profuse sweat all over my bare skin.� I feel hot, even in the dungeon's chill.� The pain is intense, fiery, worse than I had
expected it would be this early into a racking.�
&quot;Oh, shit � that's bad �&quot;�
My breathing is shallow, my ribcage already expanded by the arching of
my back, and I can feel my pounding heart thumping against my spine.

����������� &quot;Confess!&quot;

����������� &quot;No
- Zell, no!&quot; I
shout, but he pulls the lever anyway.� As
the wheel moves, my wrists are dragged a fraction of an inch further, my ankles
remain anchored, and my body is stretched.�
New pain fills my hips, spreads up my back, breathtakingly huge.� I feel my eyes widen, and I give an
involuntary groan.� Quickly, there comes
an intense agony in my arms, too, seeming to spread from my armpits up to my
elbows, hot pain as if a scalpel has sliced along the bone.

����������� &quot;Oh
Jesus, Zell!� Fuck!� This is really, really painful!&quot; I
squeal.� &quot;Ahh, shit!!&quot;� I start to shake my head.� &quot;No, I've had enough.� Enough!�
Yellow!&quot;� I can feel droplets of sweat running down my
face, beading up on my drawn breasts and my taut belly.� 

����������� Zell
lets go of the handle, but leaves the rack secured.

&quot;Zell!�
What are you doing?&quot;� As I
remain arched and in pain, he walks around me.�
The digital camera is out again; he is snapping off shots.� I try to follow his movements, but the roar
of pain is too distracting.� There is no
longer any question of being objective or detached from this experiment.� It hurts too much.� &quot;Zell, come on!&quot;

����������� &quot;But
Mistress, it has only started!&quot; he says.�
&quot;I would be so disappointed if you gave in so quickly!&quot;

����������� &quot;I� am giving in, Zell!� Yellow!�
Please, let me go!&quot;

����������� &quot;How
can it be an authentic experience if you control it so easily?� When the going gets tough, you just give
up!&quot;

����������� &quot;That's
because it really hurts!&quot; I snap.�
&quot;Let me go now!&quot;

����������� &quot;I
think we should talk about that,&quot; Zell says.

����������� &quot;What?&quot;� I am incredulous.� &quot;For fuck's sake, Zell!&quot;

����������� He
is returning to the lever.� I suddenly
find myself gibbering.� &quot;Zell - no, no, don't touch that, don't you dare, don't do it
Zell -&quot;

����������� He
cranks the lever.� 

����������� The
wheel groans around, and my body is stretched.�
As the pain flares brutally down through my legs, up my spine, up
through my arms, it is liberating just to let out a shriek of pain, although I
am able to stifle it quickly.� 

����������� &quot;Why
are you always so cold to me, Mistress?&quot; Zell suddenly asks.

����������� &quot;What?&quot;� For a moment I can't comprehend the question.�� I can feel the sweat running off me, now.

����������� &quot;I
try so hard to please you � but you treat me like all your other minions!&quot;

����������� &quot;Zell!� Shit �
please � what are you saying?!&quot;

����������� &quot;I
think it's time you did something for me,&quot; Zell explains calmly.� &quot;First, I want to be promoted to
'Torturer.'� I want to conduct my own
interrogations.&quot;

����������� &quot;You
have to be kidding!&quot; I manage to say.�
&quot;Why - aahh!! - why would I do that?&quot;

&quot;Why?�
Because of this,&quot;
Zell says.� Another notch of the rack,
and my scream is high and frantic, my mouth wide, as the fire intensifies along
my limbs.� I hear my joints crack in succession, a creaking from my tearing
spine.

&quot;Oh God!!� Zell!!�
Aaah!!&quot; 

&quot;Second, I want to be Tina deDance's
executioner.&quot;

����������� &quot;We'll
talk about it!&quot; I squeal.� &quot;Okay?� We can talk about it!&quot;

����������� &quot;We
are talking
about it,&quot; Zell says.� &quot;All you
have to do is say 'yes.'&quot;

����������� &quot;Zell,
please, please, I
can't stand the pain,&quot; I babble out.�
The sweat is stinging my eyes, so that I can barely see.

&quot;Third, I want to see Tina get publicly
tortured before her execution.� Maybe get
Kelley or someone to do it.&quot;

I say desperately, &quot;Zell, we can discuss
it, please, just loosen the rack!&quot;

����������� &quot;Please,
Mistress, let's discuss it now,&quot; Zell insists, and, to my utter disbelief, he cranks the lever
again.� Raw and terrible agony explodes
along my legs and arms, and it feels as if my abdominal muscles are tearing, my
spine breaking apart.� I am not even
aware of screaming for the first several seconds; it is a completely
involuntary reaction to the pain: I am making woooaaah
- woooo - ooooh - aaaahh noises at the top of my
lungs.

����������� When
at last I can contain my screaming, the tears flood from my eyes, spilling down
my cheeks.

����������� &quot;Oh
God, Zell, please, please stop,&quot; I sob.�
&quot;I'm begging
you, now!&quot;

����������� Without
hurry, he steps from the lever and stands close to my wrenched body.� Even stretched back over the wheel, with my
toes high off the ground, his face is level with mine.

����������� &quot;Oh,
Mistress Kirsten, you look so beautiful, suffering like this.� I wish it would never end!&quot;

����������� &quot;Aahhh � &quot; is all I
can say.

����������� &quot;Shall
I repeat my demands?&quot;

����������� I
realise I am in no position at all to deny him. &quot;Zell, ple-e-e-ase,&quot; I
wail.

&quot;So beautiful.&quot;� He puts his hand to my solar plexus.� Stretched this taut, I can barely breathe,
only my drum-tight belly shifting with desperate little fish-gasps of air.��� He trails his fingers up over my ribcage - bump-bump-bump over each
rib - then the slight swell of my breast.�
His palm brushes the hard pencil-eraser of my nipple, but I am unable to
flinch from his touch.

Finally, he leans in until his nose is almost
touching the taut, pale bed of my sweat-shining�
armpit.� He inhales the scent of
my suffering; then licks slowly along the taut ravine of straining tendon and
muscle.� His eyes close as he savours the
taste.�� &quot;Oh, Mistress!� The sweat of your torment is sweet
indeed!&quot;

I feel utterly humiliated; but it is nothing
compared to the agony in my stretched body.�
&quot;Please, Zell, just loosen it a little,&quot; I sob.

&quot;Why do you deny me, Mistress?&quot; he
whines.� &quot;You know, you leave me no
choice.&quot;

As he steps back to the lever, fresh terror
hits me.� &quot;Zell!� No!�
No!&quot;

But I can't stop him; the cogs turn, and the
big wheel shifts slightly with a sailing-ship creak.� The hot, tearing agony that explodes all
along my limbs and torso is incredible, intense, overwhelming, and this time I
can't stop my screams.

When I don't have enough breath, I simply
groan in agony.� I am sure my back is
about to break.� My hips feel as if they
are being ripped apart, my shoulders likewise.�
The ravaging agony is so intense that I can't even feel the manacles on
my wrists and ankles any more.

&quot;Okay!&quot; I manage to squeal.� &quot;You win!� Anything you want!&quot;

&quot;You will promote me to Torturer?&quot;

&quot;Yes!&quot; 

&quot;You will let me be Tina's
hangman?&quot;

&quot;Yes!&quot;

&quot;And you will have her publicly
tortured?&quot;

&quot;Yes!&quot;

&quot;There, that wasn't so hard, was
it?&quot; Zell asks smugly.

I can barely speak.� &quot;Please - Zell, please - loosen it, you
promised � oh God, I can't stand it � it hurts so much �!&quot;

&quot;Tell me, Mistress.� Tell me how it feels.&quot;� Through eyes swimming in tears of pain I see
Zell's blurred shape move away from the lever, and I give a wail of horror,
knowing that he isn't going to ease my agony yet.� Instead, he snaps more photos.� &quot;What thoughts are going through your
wonderful mind?&quot;

&quot;Oh God, Zell, I don't know, I can't
think, please, you're killing me!&quot;

&quot;Tell me how much you want me,&quot; Zell
says.

What?�
�I
can't believe what I am hearing.�� &quot;Zell �&quot; �

He returns to the lever, grasps it, and hauls
another notch.� It seems impossible that
I could be stretched any further without being torn apart; but the wheel
shifts, and I stretch.� The agony is
doubled and I am screaming dementedly.�
An instant later, there is a crack! from my left shoulder and my whole arm feels as if it has been
electrocuted.� Then, a feeling like a red
hot spike driven directly into my shoulder joint, and the pain is so severe
that my breath is stolen from me.� I
simply lie, arched over the wheel, gasping at the ceiling.

A moment later, a softer pop and my right shoulder dislocates.� The pain is a thousand times worse than
anything yet, and I can feel my eyes bulging in agony.� It is a few more seconds before I am able to
fill my lungs and start screaming.

&quot;Aaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!&quot;� My own
voice echoes off the walls of the small dungeon.� My own mindless, wordless agony.� Zell pulls the lever again and the wheel
turns, further drawing my shoulder joints apart, the tendons and ligaments
straining, pain beyond belief.� There are
tears streaming down my cheeks, sweat rolling off my ribcage and belly.� I finally manage to howl, &quot;stop, Zell, please, stop, stop, I'll do anything you ask,
anything at all!&quot;

&quot;Surrender to your feelings.� Say you will make love to me,&quot; he says.

�This
time I don't even hesitate.�
&quot;Yes!� Yes, I'll do it with
you, Zell!� Please - aaaahh it hurts, you're killing me!!&quot;

&quot;How do I know you'll keep your
word?&quot; Zell is suddenly asking.�
&quot;What if you're just saying what I want to hear?&quot;

&quot;Zell I swear, I swear, I'll do anything you ask, I'll suck you, you
can fuck me in the ass, anything, oh God,
just end the pain!!&quot;

&quot;Oh, Mistress Kirsten!� That sounds like an offer I can't
refuse,&quot; Zell bubbles happily.�
Stepping from the lever once again, he pushes my saturated hair back
from my brow.� &quot;I'll tell you what
I'm going to do.� I'm going to write up
an agreement for you to sign.� I'll
loosen you from the rack and unchain one arm so you can sign it - okay?&quot;

&quot;Yes!&quot;� Even speaking seems to send shock waves of
pain through my limbs.� I try to lift my
head, try to blink the tears and sweat from my eyes, but I am still half-blind,
still in agony beyond endurance.

&quot;Tell me who is your master.&quot;

&quot;You are, Zell,&quot; I gasp. �&quot;You are my master!&quot;

&quot;Now kiss me.&quot;

Even in such extreme agony, I can't believe
the humiliation he is putting me through.�
But I cannot deny him a single thing.�
I give a frantic nod.� He puts his
mouth to mine, and I battle the agony that tears every fibre of my racked body
to kiss him.� I slide my tongue into his
mouth, suck on his lip, let him know that if only he eases my agony I will
reward him so very well.

When the kiss is over, Zell has a satisfied
look on his face.� &quot;Thank you,
Mistress Kirsten.&quot;

He returns, at last, to the lever, and
finally begins to ease the tension on my body.�
But even as the wheel inches forward again, the shifting of my joints,
the contracting of muscles, is pain itself, and I shriek and gasp.

It has to be done a fraction at a time.

Stretched so taut, but also held so perfectly
in place, my disjointed shoulders all but reset themselves; it only takes a small
push from Zell and each one clicks back into its socket, bringing relief that is almost
orgasmic.� My arms seem to buzz as if
electricity tingles all through them.

He locks the wheel again when my heels touch
the ground, but leaves me with arms shackled over my head, half-hanging off the
curve of the wheel, still locked in padlocked fetters and helpless, while he
snaps the last few photos and goes off to prepare the agreement.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I, Kirsten Smart, declare the following:

That Dungeon Assistant Zell has demonstrated
extraordinary skill in the torture chamber, and will hereby be promoted to
Torturer, so that he may carry full responsibility for interrogations.

That, by way of acknowledging this
promotion, he also be named honorary Executioner,� tasked with carrying out the sentence of Tina
deDance.

On the strength of his advice, I will also
have Tina tortured publicly before her execution, as an added entertainment to
those who have come to watch.

Furthermore, I have decided to offer a more
personal show of my appreciation; a night spent in my private quarters, during
which I will willingly and gladly grant Zell any pleasure he may want from me.

I affirm that these decisions are of my own
volition, and that should I renege in any way, I authorise Austin, Steve, and
any other representative, to be chosen by Zell, to participate in my public
racking as punishment, to a degree determined by Zell alone.

&nbsp;

Kirsten Smart

&nbsp;

����������� He
reads it aloud to me slowly, while I remain hanging in a painful arch over the
torture wheel.

����������� &quot;Will
you sign?&quot;

����������� &quot;Yes,&quot;
I say.� My voice is heavy with
resignation; I know that to refuse will only prompt Zell to begin turning the
rack again, until unbearable agony forces me to concede to anything he may ask.
�And next time I may not escape so
lightly.

����������� Producing
a key from beneath his robes, Zell reaches up and unlocks the padlock from my
right shackle, then presents me with the declaration, fastened to a
clipboard.� Bringing my arm down, it
feels as if my shoulder joint has been packed with broken glass.� It is almost more than I can bear; I have
barely any strength.� I manage to rest my
hand on the clipboard while Zell slips a pen between my fingers.� Weakly, I scratch out my signature at the
bottom of the page.

����������� Zell
smiles.� &quot;Thank you, Mistress
Kirsten.� Now, let's get you back to your
quarters � and get some ice on those aching joints.&quot;

Kirsten Smart

Part 7 � Tina deDance

&nbsp;

����������� I
receive word that Tina deDance is ready to be questioned, and it sends a pang
of sadness through me.

����������� Tina.� The once-respected Witchseeker, whose glowing
references had opened the way for me to become Dungeon Mistress at the
chateau.� The brilliantly-inventive
torturess whose advice had led to confessions and outpourings of information.

����������� Now,
she has fallen from grace.� The first to
stand up and point the finger of accusation at Oberon, she had then run to the
side of Matmos, the Man In Black, seeking safety there, before realising the
error of her ways and, humbled and trembling, turned herself in.

����������� I check
myself in the mirror briefly.� The simple
red halter top, too brief and open to accommodate a bra beneath, teamed with
tight black PVC pants.� The top, which
leaves arms, shoulders, back and midriff bare, and leaves little else to the
imagination, seems a little flippant and sexy under the circumstances.� But the pants make my ass look damn good, so
I decide to stick with the outfit, for now, and make my way to the steep,
spiralling stairway down into the chill depths of the dungeon.

����������� This
is not the first time Tina has erred.�
Once before, stirred into a rage by a personal falling-out with Austin,
she freed the then-captive Man In Black and all but deserted us; I was able to
persuade her to change her mind, but her punishment had been a public and very
painful whipping, for which, I am sure, she never quite forgave me.

����������� Oh
my God, I chose Austin as her interrogator.

����������� Surely
he has no resentment of her, any more?�
No ongoing grudge?� A consummate
professional like Austin?� As I descend
into the darkness, the tiny hairs on my arms stand on end as I realise that
there may have been more than professional interests behind Austin's request to
conduct the sessions.

����������� I
could replace him, but that would be deeply insulting to him, and as
Witchseeker General, it is my role to be diplomat as well as leader to those
who choose to follow.

����������� The
guards at the door to the torture chamber gaze a little too lingeringly at me
as I approach, and the half-smile on the face of one makes me wonder what would
be my fate, if ever I lost my footing and fell, as Tina has done.

����������� Then
the door is opened, and I step inside, welcomed by the familiar aromas of
charred flesh and smoke, sweat and fear.

����������� The
interrogation party is already waiting in the middle of the huge vaulted
chamber; Austin, huge and ominous, dressed in black, the tallest.� Three guards stand alongside him, as well as
a scribe.� And kneeling at their feet, a
slight and slender brunette figure.�
Tina.

����������� Her
wrists are bound behind her back with rope; no need for iron, as she is not
suspected to be a witch.� She wears denim
jeans, frayed and damp around the cuffs from her time in the cells; and a
woollen sweater, cosy protection against the cold dungeon air.� She is barefoot, her pink soles bared to my
view, toes curled.

����������� Surrounding
them, beyond the slimy columns of stone that support the dingy ceiling, are the
instruments of persuasion, sadly so necessary to loosen the tongues of
reluctant witches.

����������� Tina's
head lifts a little at the sound of my approach.� &quot;Kirsten?&quot;

����������� &quot;I
am sorry that it has come to this, Tina,&quot; I say gently as I draw
near.� &quot;What were you
thinking?&quot;

����������� She
looks up at me, and her eyes show her fear.�
&quot;I had to do it.� I had to
speak out against Oberon � but then I didn't know where else to go!&quot;

����������� &quot;I
would have protected you,&quot; I tell her.

����������� &quot;Please,
take me out of here,&quot; Tina says.�
&quot;I told them there was no need to come here, that you would be
merciful.� I will tell you everything of
my own free will.&quot;

����������� &quot;You
know the rules,&quot; I respond.�
&quot;Heck, you wrote most of the rules.� You have to give evidence as any other.&quot;

����������� She
shakes her head, pleadingly.� &quot;Don't
hurt me, Kirsten.&quot;

����������� &quot;I
won't, Tina,&quot; I promise.� I glance
at one of the guards.� &quot;Untie her
hands.&quot;

����������� The
guard looks to Austin, who nods.� A
moment later, Tina's wrists are freed, and she massages circulation back into
her own small, icy fingers.� In my
barely-existent outfit I'm well aware of the cold down here.� My nipples are like bullets.

����������� &quot;Now
strip,&quot; I tell her.

����������� Tina's
face is shock.� &quot;What?&quot;

����������� &quot;Strip
off your clothes and give them to the guards.&quot;

����������� Tina
knows that she has no choice.� She strips
herself, or is stripped by the guards.�
Reluctantly standing, she grasps the bottom of her sweater with arms
crossed over her body, and slowly draws it up.�
Her hands are shaking.� Her
sweater is her confidence, her modesty, her security; divested of it, she is
vulnerable and exposed.

����������� Beneath
the sweater, all she wears is a bra.� Her
slender and pale body is all but bared; with shaking fingers, she fumbles at
the clasp of the bra, and shrugs the straps off her shoulders.� The bra falls away, and four sets of eyes
fall on her naked breasts.� Small and
firm, with rosy nipples already erect in the chill air.� She bites her lip, her eyes filling with
tears of humiliation and dread as she fumbles with the buttons of her jeans,
and bulldozes them down her creamy thighs.

����������� The
guards ogle her petite body, her carefully-trimmed thatch of dark pubic hair,
as she guards her breasts with her arms.�
I feel only empathy for her shame and fear.

����������� &quot;Bind
her hands again,&quot; Austin orders.

����������� Poor
Tina.� She would not try to escape, and
binding her hands is meant only to add to her humiliation and terror.� Her wrists are roped securely behind her
back, and she is, again, made to kneel.�
She is shaking violently, now.

����������� &quot;Please
don't torture me.&quot;� She request is
made in a low, shaking voice; it is all she can do not to scream out in
dread.� Austin looks to me; his face
shows a conflict of emotions.� A
reluctance to hurt the woman he once respected, a brutal passion to test the
instruments that he has waited so long to operate.

����������� Biting
my lip against my own tears, I go and crouch alongside Tina.� &quot;Tell us everything, then.� Tell us about Oberon and his lies, his
seductions, his burnings of innocent women.�
Tell us everything.� Tell us,
also, about Wendy Satin, the witch you sheltered while her poor cousin burned
alive.&quot;

����������� &quot;I
will tell you everything,&quot; Tina promises.

����������� She
begins, and she speaks for an hour.�
Tales emerge of Oberon's abuse of power; his visits to condemned
witches, how he would promise them mercy for a night of sexual favours, then let
them go to the stake, regardless.� His
fondling of unfortunates who hung agonised in strappado or lay, wrested out of
shape upon the rack.� And most shocking
of all, his midnight sweeps upon the homes of mothers and daughters, his
insistence that they both gratify him at once - and those who complied and
those who refused would be dragged from their homes alike, and burnt to death
at the stake, without trial, often even without their names being offered.� Trusted by all who served him, Oberon was
able to terrorise and persecute at will, and for months did so, with impunity.

����������� &quot;And
what of the witches Daffy?� And
Allielle?&quot; I ask.

����������� &quot;To
those witches, at least, Oberon kept his promise,&quot; Tina says grimly.� &quot;And, as with Wendy Satin, innocent
women were burned in their place.&quot;

����������� Tina
goes on to tell the harrowing tale of Wendy Satin.� How the confessed witch, safely restrained in
chains in her cell, had received a visit from Oberon.� On the promise of freedom, he had used her
body in the most perverted ways imaginable; and then, thinking that he might
want to repeat his carnal games with her, arranged for Wendy's innocent cousin
to be burned.

����������� Weeping
now, Tina confesses that she had comforted Wendy in the watching crowd while
her cousin died howling in the inferno.

����������� But
of course there are more questions to be answered.� Perhaps Tina thinks I have forgotten them,
but now, as she kneels still on the stone floor, naked and with hands bound
behind her, I ask.

����������� &quot;And
what of Matmos, the Man In Black?&quot;

����������� Tina
stiffens at the name, and I detect a tiny shake of her head.

����������� I
persist.� &quot;On September 14th, in a
declaration to all the Witchseekers, you accused Oberon of corruption and
sexual deviance.� You then went on to
say, and I quote, 'I am taking leave and joining my one and only mentor,� the brave, pure and courageous Matmos, the
only soul who has had the sense and intuition to correctly judge the trap
Oberon, in his vileness and wickedness, has led us into.'� Two days later, you returned, turning
yourself in to me, for which you are to be commended.

����������� &quot;My
question is this, Tina.� Where is
Matmos?&quot;

����������� Until
this point, Tina has knelt erect, despite having her hands bound behind her,
despite being naked before her inquisitors.�
But now she seems to sag, as if her spine has lost its strength.� Her fingers curl beyond the ropes that secure
her wrists.

����������� She
shakes her head.

����������� &quot;I
will not tell you.&quot;

����������� &quot;Please,
Tina.&quot;

����������� &quot;No.&quot;

����������� Now,
I crouch alongside her.� I feel
afraid.� &quot;Tina, when I first arrived
here, you spoke up for me.� You told
Oberon that I was not a witch and that I would serve him well, and I realise
now that you saved me from a terrible fate at his hands.

����������� &quot;Because
of that, I have vowed that I will not personally harm you.� But Austin can - and will.� He will do whatever is necessary to make you
reveal the location of Matmos.&quot;

����������� Tina
is shaking.� &quot;I won't talk.&quot;

����������� &quot;Tina,
please!� If I had my way, I would give
you the mercy of a quick and painless death.�
But too many innocent souls will be lost to Satan if we don't capture Matmos,
so we must draw the information we need from you.&quot;

����������� Tina
finally turns to me.� There is hatred in
her eyes.� &quot;Then you'll rot in Hell,
you traitor whore!&quot;

����������� I can
do no more.� Now her interrogation is in
Austin's hands.� I stand.� &quot;Return her to her cell naked,&quot; I
say, &quot;and burn her clothes.� Leave
her hands bound, but not chain her to the wall.�
We will resume tomorrow.&quot;

����������� That
small mercy, of course, is to be my mistake; for during the night, the witch
Kelley Smith steals her way into the chateau, bewitches Tina's guard, and frees
the traitor.� Together, the two women
flee into the woods.

&nbsp;

����������� Tina
has been recaptured.

����������� It is
thanks to Kelley Smith, the young woman tricked and violated by the vile
Oberon; the young woman who was all too quickly taken in by Tina, and fed all
manner of lies about me, and those Witchseekers who remained loyal to the
cause.

����������� Just
in time, it seems, Kelley saw sense, and contacted me with information on
Tina's whereabouts.� It was then a simple
matter of sending out Austin, and Zell, and a dozen guards to surround and
capture Tina deDance and the vicious Wendy Satin Blaze.

����������� Now,
Wendy remains chained to the wall of a windowless, unlit cell deep in the
dungeon.

For Tina, it has
been far worse.� A guard later told me
that, upon Tina's arrival, Austin had personally stripped her, removing the new
woollen sweater she had somehow acquired and ordering it, along with the rest
of her clothing, burned at once.

Then, he had her
wrists locked in shackles; and by a long chain, she was hoisted off the floor
of her cell.� More shackles were fixed
around her ankles, and the chains secured to rings in either wall, so that
Tina's slender legs were spread apart.�
Quite possibly the most vulnerable and exposed position a woman can be
forced into. Austin made sure Tina knew just how exposed she was - closing his
big paw of a hand over one breast, then caressing the trimmed patch of hair
between her outstretched legs.

&quot;Don't touch
me, you fucking gorilla!&quot; Tina had yelped, and Austin had laughed.

&quot;I'll do more
than touch you, my pretty one,&quot; he told her.� &quot;You belong to me.&quot;

Even for a
condemned traitor, hanging in chains is a terrible way to be imprisoned.� So with Austin gone, after a gruelling
fifteen hours I have Tina released from the shackles.� She lies for several hours more on the cell
floor, before dragging herself into a corner and curling up, naked, awaiting
her questioning.

She is given
food.� She is given access to a computer
so that she may communicate in her own defence.

Days pass.

Austin finally
returns from his time away, and the time has come for Tina to be
questioned.� I decide I should accompany
the guards who bring her to the torture chamber.� My outfit for today�s session is casual; a
simple floral halter-dress.� Cool and
sexy and flattering with a side-split for that occasional tantalising glimpse
of leg.� Anything to ensure the ongoing
support of my fellows.

����������� The
door to Tina's cell creaks open, and I find myself looking at a wretched, naked
creature.� Tina sits against a slimy
wall, her hair greasy and lank, her face dark with fatigue.� Her wrists still black with bruising from her
time in fetters.

����������� &quot;So,&quot;
I say.� 'The Viper,' am I?&quot;

����������� &quot;You
would have done the same, if it was you,&quot; Tina mumbles.

����������� &quot;Escaped,
yes.� But I would consider it unwise to
taunt my enemy, when my own safety in exile is so very precarious.&quot;

����������� &quot;So
you've caught me.� Enough gloating.� Just get on with it, and execute me
already.&quot;

����������� &quot;Baby,
you know I would,&quot; I say kindly.�
&quot;But we still have the small matter of Matmos to discuss.� Specifically: where is he?&quot;

����������� &quot;I
don't know.&quot;

����������� I
shake my head.� &quot;Tina, you fled this
place and went directly to him.� So I
have to consider that proof that you know where he is.� For God's sake, tell me now.� Save yourself the agonies that Austin will
visit upon your body!&quot;

����������� Tina
knows only too well what can - and will - be done.� She knows that the pain will be severe.� But I can see in her face, too, a particular
kind of defiance.� The calm, detached
look of somebody who is already resigned to her fate.

����������� &quot;Whatever
you do to me now will be torture for torture's sake.� I don't know what you ask of me.&quot;

����������� &quot;Then
I am truly sorry.&quot;� I straighten and
tell the guards, &quot;bring her.&quot;

����������� Tina's
hands are bound with rope behind her back, and she is hoisted to her feet,
half-dragged to the torture chamber, where Austin has been making preparations
for her arrival, accompanied by Zell, and Steve.� A scribe stands nearby, carefully taking down
every word.

Austin rubs his big
hands together in anticipation as we enter, then beckons us across the floor to
where he stands waiting.� 

����������� Tina
makes no sound as she is marched to a table laid out with terrible implements
of torture.� There is a wooden bench
alongside, and she is forced to sit upon its chill wood.� &quot;Welcome to my little kingdom of pain,
Tina,&quot; Austin says grandly.�
&quot;Here, you will discover a whole new world of agony and
suffering.&quot;

����������� Tina
does not give him any reply.� Her face
appears blank as she regards the assembled tools; pliers, pincers, whips,
flails, manacles and many more.� The
device Austin selects looks, at first, like a grossly oversized version of a
thumbscrew.� Two squared iron bars, an
inch wide � almost like the blades of files.�
Each roughly fourteen inches long.�
At the ends of both bars are eyelets, through which screws have been
threaded; by turning the screws, the bars can be brought closer together.

����������� &quot;Hold
her,&quot; Austin says.

����������� By
Zell and Steve, Tina's arms and shoulders are grasped firmly, forced forward,
effectively hunching her over and making the most of her petite breasts.� A guard fits the breast-crusher over them -
one bar below her breasts, one bar above - and Austin slowly begins to turn the
screws.� Gradually, the bars are wound
closer together.� The effect is to
gradually squash and distend Tina's breasts at their base, forcing the weight
of� them outwards, exaggerating and
distending them .� She bites her lip in
rapidly-growing discomfort.� With cruel
slowness, the iron� faces press onto her
tender flesh.� 

����������� �I�ve
been learning a thing or two from our sage advisor, the 'other' Steve in
Canada.�� Fitting, don�t you think, that
a compatriot of yours should have had input into this?�

����������� �You
don�t have to do this, Austin � baby �� Tina gasps.� Her breasts are small, but the breast-crusher
stretches the tissue of her chest and belly so that they are effectively
extruded between the narrow plates.� She
grimaces with the growing pain.

����������� Austin
does not respond to her desperate offer; he simply screws the crusher down a
little further.� Tina gasps and struggles
to free her bound wrists, but she is helpless.�
It makes me wince to see it; now her breasts look like balloons going
through a wringer.� They are turning
crimson; I can see the veins beneath her skin, and her nipples have swelled and
darkened.� For someone so poorly endowed,
she now seems to have doubled her cup-size in a matter of minutes.

����������� Another
turn of the screw; compressing the base of her breasts still further.� Tina�s face wears an expression of growing
agony.� She groans with the next turn of
the screws. 

�No more,� she
moans.�� �Austin, stop �!�

He ignores her, and
screws the crusher down further still.�
Tina give a wail, the iron bars exerting unbearable pressure on her
tender flesh.� With the next turn, her
cry is louder, more anguished; the tendons on the side of her neck stand out
and her shoulders shake.� Zell and Steve
hold her steady, watching as her breasts, swollen and shining, bulge
grotesquely through the crusher.

����������� Tina
gives a high pitched wail � then makes a sound like a duck.� A moment later she throws up, a hot watery
spurt that splashes over Austin�s robes and splats between her bare toes.

����������� �Oh �
shit!� Austin yelps.� Tina looks
dangerously pale, her body suddenly limp in her captors' grip, her skin glossed
with a sheen of cold sweat.

�The pain must be awful already; but the
torment has not even begun: now, Austin grabs up two lengths of thick, oily
rope.� Standing behind Tina, Austin loops
the rope about her upper arms, immediately above her elbows, then cinches it
tight.� Tina�s elbows are wrenched
together, and she gives a shriek of pain as muscle and sinew through her chest
and shoulders is stretched painfully taut.�
Austin tightens the rope until Tina�s elbows are firmly pressed
together, a deep gully between her straining shoulder blades.� Then he binds it tight, around and around her
arms.

����������� �Oh �
Jesus �� Tina gasps, her eyes fixing wide on the ceiling.� A droplet of sweat runs down her face.� Her lower jaw trembles.� Her wrists, and now her elbows too.� She doesn't even struggle, knowing there is
not a chance she could get free.

����������� But
it is not over yet.� Austin is meticulous
in his preparation.� Even as Tina bites
her lip not to cry out, he selects two more items.� Small screw-down spider-clamps.� Intricate, ingenious, about the size of
bulldog-clips that one might use in the office, but with a small screw to tighten
its jaws, and a secret spike that extends as the screw is turned.

����������� I
want to turn away.� But I have to watch.

����������� Tina's
nipples are already swollen from the strangled circulation in her aching
breasts, and they present a fat and ready target for the clamps.� Austin places the first over her left nipple,
and twists the screw.� Tina gasps and
tries to pull away; the little spiked jaws squeeze down on her nipple with
gradually-increasing pressure, flattening it, squashing it out.� And, a fraction of an inch at a time, the
spike pushes into the very tip of her nipple, piercing the nerve-rich flesh.

����������� Austin
screws it tightly, so that Tina gives an involuntary squeak, her face showing
every bit of the pain she feels.� Then
Austin gives it two more turns, to make his point, and Tina gives a cry.

����������� &quot;No!� Stop! �Aah, you bastard!&quot;

����������� The
second clamp is screwed on to Tina's right nipple, closed tightly so that her
tender flesh is crushed and pierced.�
Tina is rocking slightly from side to side in her pain; a dark line of
blood runs down the shining, balloon-swollen curve of her trapped breast.

����������� I put
my hands over my mouth.� I feel sick.

����������� �Goddamn
you,� Tina groans.� �You perverted
bastard!�

����������� Austin
looks philosophical, then grasps the ends of the breast crusher and tugs
hard.� Tina rocks forward with a look of
shock, then gives a howl of pain.

����������� �Oh
Go-o-od!!�� She writhes her shoulders
in a frantic attempt to free her bound arms as Austin twists the crusher,
shaking it from side to side.� Tina�s
ready-to-burst breasts are wrenched about, the clamps jiggling on her
mashed� nipples.� �Stop!�
Fuck you, stop!�

����������� Austin
scowls, stands, and, holding the breast-crusher in one hand, drags Tina after
him.� She yelps, stumbles, twisting her
own breasts agonisingly in the process.�
She is half-dragged for several yards behind the big man, before finally
managing to get her feet�� Her bare soles
scrabble on the floor; shrieking and whimpering, arms twisted behind her, she
helplessly stumbles after Austin.

����������� �Oh �
Christ, no!�

����������� When
she sees the chain dangling from the ceiling, she knows what has been planned
for her.� The very torture she had once
excitedly described to me for Stacy Sambilay is now to be inflicted on her.

����������� Her
bloated breasts jiggle as she tries to pull away, but Austin has been joined
again by Zell and Steve, who grab her bound arms and hold her steady.� To an iron ring in the suspension chain,��� Austin has attached two shorter chains
ending in heavy padlocks.� Now, he
attaches the chains to either end of the breast-crusher, locking the padlocks
while Tina desperately tries to bargain with him.

����������� �Austin,
this isn�t what you want.� Come on.� We�ve known each other for a long time �
maybe we can come to an arrangement �?�

����������� �Sure.� You talk, we stop torturing you,� Austin
rumbles.

����������� With
the chains secured, Zell leaves Tina in the hands of Austin and Steve, and
crosses to the winch, grasping its worn wooden handle.

����������� �Here's
where the �toadie� gets to have fun,� Zell bubbles, and cranks it over.

����������� �You
bastards!� I�ll see your balls mashed to
pulp for this!� Tina shrieks as the chains tighten.� Her half-squashed, half-bloated breasts are
wrenched upwards, and her shrieks rise in pitch accordingly.� Her legs stretch beautifully as she rises
onto tiptoes, but a moment later she is lifted off the ground by her trapped
breasts, and her head rocks back as she wails in pain.� She doesn�t even kick her feet � the movement
would only add to the hideous ache in her breasts.� In a matter of seconds her entire body is
covered in tiny droplets of sweat.� Her
body� hangs in a slight arch.

����������� Zell
secures the winch with Tina�s toes six inches from the floor; Austin still
stands taller than her.� She squeals in
pain, the chain groaning as her body slowly swings at its end.� I can only imagine the pain; it would be
hideous, intense, urgent.� It would feel
as if her breasts are on the verge of being torn out of her chest, ripped from
their bed of muscle.� In contrast, the
clamps on her nipples will feel like two points of white-hot agony, like
branding irons pressed directly where her breasts are their most
sensitive.� I can see it is taking a
supreme effort not to scream.

����������� �Tell
us where Matmos is,� Austin growls.

����������� �The
last I knew was a training camp in Dogville,� Tina gasps.� &quot;But he moved from there, and now I
don't know!&quot;

����������� &quot;You're
close to him.� He would tell you.&quot;

����������� &quot;I
swear, he didn't!&quot;

����������� Firmly,
with one big hand, Austin grasps the crimson balloon of Tina�s left breast, and
twists the screw of her nipple clamp.�
Tina screams in pain, flinging her head back, as the tiny spiked jaws
crush and mash the tender stub of flesh.�
Another dark line of blood escapes down her breast.� Tina�s bare toes are fanned out in response
to her helplessness to escape such agony.�
He does the same to her right nipple, closing the clamp so tightly that
its teeth all but meet through her flesh. 

����������� �We�ll
take a break now,� Austin announces.�
�Resume in an hour or so.�

����������� Two
guards are posted; but as Austin, Zell, Steve, the scribe and remaining guards
all leave, I stand in front of my former colleague.� Tina�s head rocks from side to side, her
shoulders strained and arms so fiercely bound behind her, her stretched and
distended breasts compressed cruelly within the crusher by which she hangs, her
nipples mashed and bleeding in their clamps.�


����������� �For
God�s sake, Tina, what are you thinking?� I say, after a while.� �You know you can�t keep Matmos�
location a secret.� Evil cannot be
tolerated.� Tell� us where he is, and it will end.� I promise, you�ll be treated well.�

����������� Sweat
polishes Tina�s skin, her face is a mask of agony,� but she manages to force a few words past the
pain.� �I'll live to see you burn, Viper
��

I sigh, and leave
her to her suffering.

����������� It is
another two hours before Zell taps on my door to inform me of the session�s
resumption.� I accompany him to the
dungeon � where we are greeted by the sight of Austin chatting to a familiar
figure.

Kelley Smith.

She is my height,
and sexy, with full hips and a magnificent ass, high round breasts that are
plumped by the tight black leather bustier she wears.� It is strapless, leaving her creamy-pale
shoulders and arms bare, emphasising the slender taper of her waist.� She wears an asymmetric black leather skirt,
angling from high on one milky thigh down to the opposite knee, and black boots
with two-inch heels.� Her long,
naturally-cascading hair is tied into a tail by tight windings of a black
leather thong.

����������� Kelley,
the �blushing innocent� who has proved her worth by delivering Tina to us,
surprises me again with her appearance as the vampish dominatrix.

Austin grins at me and Zell as we draw closer.� �Guys, I�d like you to meet� Kelley Smith, out newest recruit.�

����������� Across
the torture chamber, I am aware of the dangling figure of Tina, shining with
perspiration, arms still wrenched behind her, suspended in agony by her mashed
breasts.� How deliciously cruel to flaunt
Kelley in front of Tina, rubbing salt into the wound of her betrayal.

����������� But
it gets better.� �I�ve invited her to
assist in the interrogation.�

����������� �What
did you have in mind?� I ask.

����������� The
whip Austin hands Kelley is made of heavy plastic cable, like a car jumper
lead.� A yard in length, tapered at the
tip, with a rubber handgrip.�� Kelley is
wide-eyed in delight, and swishes the lash through the air a few times.

����������� �God,�
she says, �this will hurt!�

����������� �That�s
the idea,� Austin says, �now come with me.�

Trailing the whip
along the floor, Kelley sashays after Austin, swaying her skirted hips� and playing up to the goggle-eyed stares of
the Zell and Steve.� Even the scribe
risks a second glance between his note-taking.�
By grim contrast, Tina hangs by her misshapen and purple breasts, her
crushed nipples encrusted with blood beneath the teeth of the clamps.� Her head lolls, her eyelids heavy with
suffering.

����������� �Tina,�
Austin calls.

����������� Tina
groans.� Her toes twitch.� She picks her head up.� Austin says, �you know where Matmos is.� On the fourteenth of September, you left the
Chateau and joined The Man In Black at his secret hideaway.� Where is that place?�

����������� &quot;I
only know of Dogville, nowhere else,&quot;�
Tina groans.

����������� Austin
steps aside, and Kelley, brandishing the whip, flashes her eyes at Tina.�� &quot;Hello, Sweetheart!&quot;

����������� &quot;Kelley!&quot;
Tina's expression is one of dread.�
&quot;Oh, God, Kelley � please, what are you doing here?&quot;

����������� &quot;'Your
back, breasts and torso, legs and ass, groin and feet, thighs and hands, sliced
to ribbons, welt after welt with a cane and cat, burrowing step by step into
your treacherous and deceitful flesh.'�
Remember those words, Tina?&quot; Kelley asks.

����������� &quot;No,&quot;
Tina sobs.� &quot;No, no, no �&quot;

����������� &quot;Now
your venomous curse comes back to haunt you.&quot;

����������� Seeing
what is about to come, Tina gives a wail of horror, but she can�t do a thing to
prevent it.� Kelley raises her arm, and
slashes down with the whip.� It angles
across Tina�s exposed belly with a heavy crack! and she screams
with� pain, her body set swinging.

����������� I
have felt the bite of the whip, and I know how fiery and intense the pain
is.� It is searing, a terrible agony, and
as the whip smashes again across her flesh, raising a fine spray of sweat into
the air, Tina twists and shrieks, an agonised pi�ata.� The wrenching of her tormented breasts must
be utterly excruciating; but she cannot help herself.

����������� Kelley
circles her helpless victim, her eyes shining with a lust for retribution as
she throws the lash with frightening expertise.�
The thick whip lands with resounding impacts, leaving raised welts
across Tina�s skin.� A dozen or more
strokes, until Tina is begging and pleading for it to stop.

����������� Kelley
pauses, breathing hard.� Tina swings by
her breasts, sobbing and wailing.� Her
fingers curl and stretch beyond the tight ropes around her wrists, an
expression of utter helplessness as Kelley measures up the next lash.

����������� It
cracks across Tina�s lower belly, and she jack-knifes in agony, raising her
knees in a feeble attempt to protect herself; Kelley seizes the opportunity and
swings a beautiful upstroke that scores a direct hit between Tina�s legs.� Tina�s legs jerk downwards, her head flies
back, and she screams in pain.

����������� &quot;Woohoo!� Did you see that?&quot; Kelley squeals.� &quot;Right in the clit!&quot;

�Oh God, please
sto-o-op!�

Tina's plea is
answered with another slice of the whip across her ribcage, an angry red weal
branding her skin.� It is followed by a
backhand slice in the other direction, then another, then another; Tina's
thrashing body scored with angry red lines.

Finally, on an
instruction from Austin, Kelley lowers her arm, and the whip slithers back
across the floor.� Sequins of
perspiration glitter on her bare shoulders, and her pouting breasts heave.� She smiles at me.

Austin closes on
Tina.� He grasps her face in his massive
hand and forces her to look up into his eyes.�
Tears stream down her cheeks.� &quot;Talk,
you traitor.� Talk, because there is a
lot more we can still do.&quot;

Tina's bare feet
stir.� Her mouth is a grimace of
misery.� &quot;Please, no more!&quot;

&quot;Where is
Matmos?&quot;

&quot;Have mercy on
me, please!� I can't tell you&quot;

I see a bright line
of blood run down the inside of Tina's sweat-slick thigh; the whip-lash between
her legs must have cut her.� The pain
must be hideous.� And it isn't over.

&quot;We proceed to
the next stage.� Bring the belt, and lead
weights,&quot; Austin says.

&quot;Oh God � no, no!&quot;
Tina begs.

It is an iron hoop,
hinged on one side, with holes along the opposite side, so that it can be
padlocked around the victim's waist.� A
slim chain of sharp-edged and spiked links spans the diameter of the hoop; when
the 'belt' is in place, the chain rides between the victim's legs.� One end of this chain then passes through a
hole in the back of the 'belt' and dangles free; at its end is an iron ring to
which weights can be attached.� Put in
the most simple terms, it is a device designed to turn the innocent 'wedgie'
into true torture.

While Zell and
Kelley hold Tina in place, Austin places the cold iron around Tina's waist,
adjusting it so that it sits straight, then cinching it tightly and closing its
lock.� Steve, then, brings from implement
table twenty-pound lead ingots, dented and chipped from past use.� 

&quot;Austin, you
are torturing me for no reason!� I cannot
tell you want to hear!&quot; Tina protests desperately.� 

&quot;She can
so,&quot; Kelley says brightly.�
&quot;She told me she visited Matmos every night!&quot;

&quot;Kelley!&quot;
Tina shrieks.� &quot;Why do you say such
lies?� You were my friend!&quot;

&quot;How can I be
the friend of a traitor?&quot; Kelley snaps in reply.� &quot;Steve, will you please hand me one
of� those weights!&quot;

&quot;My
pleasure,&quot; Steve murmurs.

Tina tries to see
behind her, twisting her head about in dread, as Kelley hefts the first of the
weights and fits its hook through the ring of Tina's crotch-chain.� &quot;Suffer, my sweet bitch,&quot; she says,
and lets it drop.

The chain snaps
taut, disappearing up into Tina's crotch; the iron belt jams down into her
hips; and Tina jolts, additional weight now wrenching her agonised
breasts.� She gives a cry of pain.� &quot;Ohhhh Jesus!!&quot;

Kelley takes the
second weight, and, without ceremony, hooks it on.�� The chain between Tina's legs cuts into her
sensitive flesh, and she howls with the pain of it, as her creaking breasts
stretch a little further under the added weight.� Despite the agony, she kicks her feet
desperately, twisting and struggling.

&quot;Kirsten!� Oh God, Kirsten, help me!&quot; Tina
shrieks.� But there is nothing I can do,
and as Austin, Zell and Steve prepare to leave, I accompany them.� Only Kelley remains, slowly walking around
the tortured figure of Tina, taunting and laughing at her.

&quot;A few more
hours of this, and she'll break,&quot; Austin says, with confidence.

There can be no
doubt that it all hurts, but I am not so sure.�
&quot;She's tough,&quot; I say.�
&quot;And presuming she does know where Matmos is, there is a lot
at stake.� Especially if she believes
that he will save her before the noose rises.�
If she betrays him, she is lost.&quot;

&quot;She'll
talk.� You leave her to me,&quot; Austin
says.

&nbsp;

����������� Tina
is left to hang by her breasts for the rest of the day.

����������� When
the rest of the Chateau is enjoying dinner in the banquet hall, I tiptoe down
into the torture chamber, rubbing my own bare shoulders against the chill.� The door is guarded; and two more guards
stand inside.

����������� By
the flickering orange light of torches, Tina still hangs by her breasts.� They seem to have stretched grotesquely,
still clamped within the crusher, now resembling two purple socks with tennis
balls inside.� There are lines of old
blood down her ribcage from where the iron breast-crusher has torn her
flesh.� Her nipples, inside the mashing
clamps, are almost blue.� Her whip-scored
skin, crazed with savage raised welts, shines with sweat.� Her back-twisted arms, roped together at
elbows and wrists, are also dark with slowed circulation, her fingers blue and
swollen.

����������� My
eyes follow the sharp little chain of the belt, down through the trimmed patch
of her pubic hair, disappearing between her labia.� I can see, on the floor below her dangling
feet, splats of old blood from where the chain has slowly worked into her
sensitive flesh.

����������� Her
head lolls on one shoulder, but even as I draw close, I hear a low groan from
her throat.� The agony goes on.� Every moment must be a battle of sheer
willpower, an overwhelming urge not to scream out that she will tell us
everything.� 

����������� &quot;Tina,&quot;
I call softly.

����������� It
takes supreme effort for her to lift her head; her eyes seem dull, and I am surprised
that she even recognises me.� Her dry and
swollen lips form a single plea:�
&quot;Kirsten � for God's sake � end it �&quot;

����������� I
shake my head.� She will only be granted
the mercy of death when she tells us what we need to hear.� So she asks for the one thing I may
grant:� &quot;water �&quot;

����������� From
a pail beneath an old faucet in one wall of the dungeon, I fill an iron ladle,
and carry it to the suspended Tina.� I
raise the ladle to her parched lips, and gently tip it, so she can drink.� Her agony is such that she can only take a
little at a time, but eventually the ladle is emptied.

By morning, when I
join the interrogators in the chamber, new torments are already under way.� Tina has hung for nearly twenty-four hours by
her breasts, and she looks utterly exhausted. 

Kelley, in a tight
black leather dress � that hugs the voluptuous curve of her hips and flatters
her high, round breasts with a plunging neckline, its hem high on her creamy
thighs � grins at me as she heaves another twenty-pound lead weight and carries
it across to the tortured woman.

&quot;Oh, you're
kidding,&quot; I realise in horror.

As Kelley hooks the
third weight onto the chain passing between Tina's legs, a barely-human sound
echoes around the torture chamber.�
Tina's scream is hoarse and hideous.�
The chain slides fractionally, its tiny spikes and sharp edges tearing
at her clitoris, between her labia, her anus; all but slicing her open.� Even her pelvic bone must be throbbing in the
most terrible agony from the pressure.

This, in addition
to the pain in her distended breasts; the searing fire in her ruined
nipples.� Now, as Tina shrieks and sobs
anew, Austin crouches at her feet.� His
first act is to put rope around Tina's ankles, binding them tightly
together.� Such is the agony between her
legs that Tina can't even struggle, but allows Austin to do whatever he wishes
to her feet.

Aligning her two
big toes, Austin fits a simple thumbscrew over them, the half-inch wide iron
bar spanning the latter portion of the knuckle.�
Deftly, firmly, he begins to screw it down.� In just a few twists, the pain arrives � with
such intensity that, despite the agony of the belt, Tina gives a new shriek of
pain, and tries to pull her feet away.

Austin twists the
screw again; then again.� Tina's
screeching becomes frantic, and she jerks and writhes so that the sixty pounds
of weights hanging off the belt chain smack lazily together.� But she can do nothing to stop Austin turning
the screw, until I hear the distinct crack of her toe-knuckle
fracturing.

Tina screams.

Austin twists the
screw again, tightening the device further, and a moment later I hear the pop
of her other toe cracking also.�
Fresh sweat forms like condensation over Tina's body, as she screams and
shrieks in pain.

Austin leaves her,
then, with her broken toes rapidly turning dark, and fetches two more weights;
another forty pounds.� These he attaches
to the screw on her toes, then signals Zell, who has been patiently waiting at
the winch.

The chain slowly
clatters through its overhead pulley, and, by her distorted breasts, Tina is
hoisted higher.� The chains connecting
her crushed toes to the lead weights quickly grow taut � and then, the weights
themselves are lifted from the floor.�
Tina's eyes bulge and she shrieks in new agony.

����������� &quot;Talk!&quot;
Austin bellows at her.� &quot;Tell us
where Matmos is, and you will be shown mercy!&quot;

����������� &quot;For
pity's sake, I don't kno-o-ow!&quot; Tina shrieks in her pain.� Then her voice dissolves into wordless howls
and sobs, as she slowly twirls on her mangled breasts.�� Scowling, Austin gives the order that we
should leave her, and return later in the day.

&nbsp;

����������� Six
hours.

����������� To
Tina, every second of those six hours must be a lifetime.� When the pain is so overwhelming, when the
roaring, screeching cacophony of pain receptors becomes so intense that not a
single thought can form, every shift of the second hand across a clock's face
is a slow-motion taunt.� When sweat
creeps and beads from every pore, when one's entire body is a temple of
exquisite suffering, six hours is Eternity.

����������� Six
hours must be long enough to be driven insane by the agony.� Or so Tina may well wish; but the reality is
that she is aware.� Lucid, alert,
conscious; and yet utterly helpless, unable to either tolerate or escape the
agony.� All she can do is groan.

����������� Her
breasts feel as if they have become red hot mounds of lava, crushed and mangled
but still a part of her, still the source of unending agony.� Her nipples throb in slow, immense waves of
white-hot pain, at times so severe that she screams out across the chill
torture chamber.

����������� Her
shoulders feel as if they have been dislocated; muscles burning and straining,
joints and tendons swollen and strained.�
Her arms, too, ache terribly, her elbows still bound so that they touch
together, her wrists so tightly tied that her hands have lost all feeling, all
movement.

����������� Between
her legs, too, is fire.� Bearing the
force of sixty pounds of lead weights, the spiked and edgy chain has burrowed
up into her sex, bisecting her vulva, cutting into the tender flesh of her
clitoris, her perineum, her anus, and feels as if it saws into the very bone.

����������� Her
toes, also, are an unrelenting agony.�
The narrow, serrated bars of the screw have cracked and crushed the
knuckle-bones of her largest two toes, and now forty pounds of lead swings from
them, putting constant and terrible pressure on the fractures.� Already they have turned almost black, and
swollen grotesquely.

����������� I
make it my task to bring her water, again.�
This time I am obliged to stretch as high as I can reach, to get the
ladle to her parched lips; much of the water spills down her chin, splashes
over her crushed and blue-shaded breasts.

����������� She
does not thank me.� She does not say a
word.� She only moans to herself in her
nightmare of agony.

����������� I am
amazed at how motionless she hangs.� When
every tiny movement is agony aggravated, when even the act of breathing is
torment, she dares not twitch a muscle.�
If one were to sit and watch her for an hour, they might believe her
dead, were it not for the shallow, spasmodic shifting of her belly, and the
groans that come from her throat.

����������� She
does move, though, when the door to the torture chamber opens, and the
footsteps of half a dozen people echo through the cavernous room.� Her head lifts; it is the only thing she can
move, now.� And she gives a tiny whimper.

����������� &quot;My
God, Tina!� Look at you!&quot; Austin
scoffs as he, Zell, Kelley, a scribe, and two accompanying guards draw
close.� &quot;You're a mess!� You think your precious Matmos is coming to
save you?&quot;

����������� &quot;I
heard he likes nothing more than to know a woman is suffering because of
him,&quot; Kelley adds.� &quot;He doesn't
care whether you live or die!&quot;

����������� &quot;I
can't tell you what you want to hear,&quot; Tina groans.

����������� &quot;Kelley,
bring the lash,&quot; Austin orders.

����������� As
Kelley goes to the implement table, I have to turn away.� Tina again starts to beg for the torture to
stop.� &quot;No � no � no � no more,
please �&quot;� 

����������� &quot;Where
is Matmos?&quot;

����������� &quot;I
told you, I told you, I don't know!&quot; Tina wails.

����������� Kelley
returns with the whip, cracking it in the air.�
It makes a startling sound, and Tina gives a wavering cry of dread, even
before Austin gives the order.� With the
darkest little smile, she swings the lash.�
It encircles Tina's unprotected hips, wrapping around her body and
slicing her flesh with a crack! and, despite all the torments that
cripple her body, Tina jolts in reaction to the pain.

����������� Her
scream is terrible.� A second stroke,
across her shining thighs.� A third
stroke, same place.� And suddenly, Tina
is twisting and shrieking and pleading under the precise and agonising touch of
Kelley's whip.� It must feel like a
lifetime since the torture began; Tina's flesh has been crushed, twisted,
scored and striped until she screams mindlessly in her pain.� Now the heavy lead weights clatter and sway
as her body jerks and swings, hanging by her tortured breasts.

����������� I see
stripes of blood, now, appearing across Tina's belly, her buttocks.� Kelley even lashes Tina's bound arms, letting
the heavy whip cut into the shrieking woman's hands, its tip biting tiny divots
of flesh from her ribcage.� I count
thirty strokes, measured and hard, while Tina bellows and wails.

����������� Finally,
the whip slithers obediently to Kelley's side, leaving a smear of blood on the
floor.� There is silence, save Tina's
agonised whimpering.

����������� &quot;Where,
Tina?&quot; I ask, finally.

����������� Tina
says nothing, but sobs piteously.� I make
eye contact with Austin and slowly shake my head.� As brutal as this torture is, I don't think
Tina will break.� It will take something
even more painful to wring her most deeply guarded secret from her.

����������� Austin
scowls, then concedes.� &quot;Let her
hang another hour, then bring her down.&quot;

����������� 

����������� I� have called a meeting to discuss Tina's
questioning.� Intending to go for a run
immediately afterwards, my 'outfit' is nothing but a racer-back sports bra and
gym shorts, running shoes on my feet.�
But Zell, at least, is impressed.

����������� &quot;My
Lady, I am as wood at the sight of you,&quot; he sighs.

����������� But
when Kelley arrives a few minutes later, I feel utterly under-dressed.� A black lace-up corset, milky-bare shoulders
and arms and plumped pouting breasts, her hair cascading down her creamy back,
and a leopard-skin miniskirt that caresses her Jennifer Lopez butt in a
mesmerising way.� The black calf-high
stiletto-heeled boots add insult to my injury.�


����������� Austin
and Steve look most impressed.� Zell
pretends not to notice her, bless him.

����������� &quot;The
question is, does Tina know where Matmos is,&quot; I begin, when all are
seated at the table.

����������� &quot;I
think she doesn't,&quot; Austin says.�
&quot;She would have told us, long ago.&quot;

����������� &quot;Most
people would have,&quot; I agree.�
&quot;But this is Tina.� She's
tough.� Pain, to her, is something to
focus on, something to embrace.� It's
like her meditation.� Especially
sustained pain, like she's been subjected to.&quot;

����������� &quot;Then
we're screwed,&quot; Austin says.

����������� &quot;Not
necessarily.�� We just have to think
smarter.&quot;

����������� &quot;Think
'Smart,' that's good, Kirsten,&quot; Zell sniggers, to icy stares from the
others.

����������� &quot;What
do you suggest?&quot; Kelly asks.

����������� &quot;I
think the key is understanding what motivates her,&quot; I say.� &quot;It was the same with Oberon: he endured
horrendous pain, but as soon as I threatened the one thing that really mattered
to him - his balls - he talked.� Like
Oberon, Tina doesn't actually think she's going to be executed.� So we simply need to do what I did to
Oberon.&quot;

����������� &quot;But
My Lady, Tina doesn't have testicles,&quot; Zell says, puzzled.

����������� Only
an awkward cough breaks the otherwise uncomfortable silence.

����������� &quot;This
is what I know about Tina,&quot; I say.�
&quot;She believes that as a woman, she is inherently superior to men,
who are all sex-driven animals and easily manipulated.&quot;

����������� &quot;So
� we rape her?&quot; Austin tries.

����������� &quot;No,
we do not,&quot; I respond.� &quot;That
would only strengthen her.� It would
vindicate her view of men.� And it would
make her a martyr to all those women who suffered at Oberon's corrupt
hands.&quot;

����������� &quot;So
what do you suggest?&quot; Kelley asks.

����������� &quot;The
pear.� It was always her torture of
choice, and for a reason.� It's the ultimate
degradation to a woman; it destroys her, without killing her.� If Tina knows where Matmos is, the pear will
drag it out of her.&quot;

����������� Austin
looks inspired.� &quot;Then the pear it
will be.� But I'm holding you responsible
if it doesn't work, Kirsten.&quot;

����������� All eyes
are on me.� I bite my lip, and nod.

&nbsp;

����������� It is
another two days until Tina is considered recovered enough to be questioned
once again.� Austin again heads the
session, with Steve, Zell, and Kelley assisting, a scribe recording events, and
me as observer.

����������� White
boob tube and black skirt.� Black
boots.� Kelley, claiming to suffer from
heat, is dressed again in her simple black corset and asymmetric black skirt.� The contrast with her creamy skin is most
fetching, and she has her hair tied in a practical ponytail.

����������� All
eyes are on the entrance to the torture chamber as Tina is brought in by four
guards, her wrists again bound behind her back.�
Naked, but determined and dignified, she walks - or rather, hobbles - on
her own.� But she is a mess.� With her toes broken, swollen and black, she
can only walk on the outsides of her feet.�
Her legs, buttocks, belly and ribcage are a mess of cris-crossing welts
from the whip.� She moves awkwardly, her
crotch still sore from the belt-chain.�
But her breasts are the most gruesome; black and yellow and purple with
bruising, her nipples swollen and dark.� 

����������� &quot;Haven't
you had enough of me yet, you sadistic fucks?&quot; Tina groans as she is
brought near.� &quot;Just let me
die!&quot;

����������� &quot;Where
is Matmos?&quot; Austin asks.

����������� &quot;I
have told you a hundred times, I don't know.�
All I knew was his Colorado hideout, but he has gone from there!&quot;

����������� &quot;He
must have given you another place to go, if you escaped,&quot; Steve says.

����������� &quot;No,
nowhere.&quot;

����������� &quot;Tina,
you will be tortured until you tell us.�
So save yourself a lot of pain, and tell us now,&quot; Austin
says.

����������� A
tear trails down Tina's cheek.�
&quot;What the fuck do you want me to say?� Should I make some place up, just to avoid
you hurting me?&quot;

����������� &quot;You
will tell us the truth,&quot; Austin hisses.

����������� The
iron torture frame has been set up, the same bed of interrogation on which
Oberon broke so quickly.� Tina is loosely
shackled, at first, in an X-shape; but then Zell and Kelley turn the screws
tightening the chains to her ankles.�
Slowly, Tina's feet are inched apart; drawing her downwards on the
frame, thus stretching her arms gradually from the wrist manacles.� She bites her lip and tips her head back,
watching her own arms draw tight.� As her
legs are cranked apart, her sense of helplessness must be overwhelming.� Her vulva is completely exposed, drawn open,
every little cleft and contour of her genitalia presented to the idle gaze of
those gathered to torture her.

����������� Zell
and Kelley keep turning the screws.�
Tina's ankles are spread four feet apart, the muscles of her thighs
taut, the tendons like cables.� Tina
gives a groan from the strain; her left hip gives an ominous pop as it
nears its fullest extension.� Her arms
are tight, her ribcage lifted, her hollowed belly shifting rapidly with her
breath.� Fearful sweat glistens in her
armpits and between her ruined breasts.

����������� &quot;Enough,&quot;
Austin says.� Kelly skips to his
side.� Zell hesitates, then grasps the
heavy iron lattice of the frame, smiling down at Tina where she lies helpless.

����������� &quot;You
know, when you're like this, you do look beautiful,&quot; he says.� &quot;Although not nearly as beautiful as
when you start screaming.&quot;

����������� &quot;Come
on, Zell � &quot; Tina offers desperately.�
&quot;Think of what I could do for you?&quot;

����������� &quot;Tina
baby, this is doing it for me right now,&quot; Zell says happily, and gives the
frame a light shove as he moves away.�
From its four suspending chains, the frame sways lazily, and Tina gives
another groan.

����������� &quot;Kirsten
said I'm not to rape you,&quot; Austin says, a segue to the coming
session.� &quot;Which I think is a pity �
as will you, when you see the alternative.&quot;

����������� Tina's
eyes widen at the sight of the gleaming brass bulb-shape in Austin's
hands.� Then the tears come; her mouth
curls into a grimace, and she is sobbing uncontrollably.� &quot;Oh, God, no, anything but that!&quot;

����������� &quot;Do
I need to remind you how the pear works, what it can do?&quot; Austin
rumbles.� &quot;Watch.&quot;� Holding it up so that she can see it clearly,
Austin turns its handle.�
Before Tina's horrified eyes, the bulb splits into segments, like an
opening flower-bud.� Gradually, the
petals extend outwards, until it is several times its original diameter.� Its diabolical implications are obvious, but
Austin delights in explaining.� &quot;�
Inserted into the anus or vagina the pear is slowly opened.� It is exquisitely painful - and in many
cases, it is fatal.&quot;� Without hurry,
he closes the device.� &quot;Although in
your case, I have asked for Kelley to make sure it doesn't get to that
point.&quot;

����������� Kelley,
her hands clasped behind her back, steps forward with a smile.

����������� &quot;Austin,
no � please,&quot; Tina pants from where she lies, starfished and helpless on
the frame.� I can see the utter panic on
her face.� But I can also see the
absolute blood-lust on Austin's, as, putting one hand on Tina's heaving belly,
he positions the nipple-like nose of the pear at the entrance to her
vagina.� He pushes, hard.� Tina gives a rising wail as, against
considerable resistance, the pear is slowly forced inside her.

����������� I
can see the muscles of Tina's widely-spread legs flexing as she desperately
tries to close them together, an instinctive reaction against the cold metal
intrusion.� Even closed, it hurts as it
penetrates her.� Eight inches long, its
nose presses against her cervix when it is finally in place, only the ornate
brass handle protruding grotesquely from her entrance.

����������� She
pisses herself.

����������� Austin
should have seen it coming; as it is, he gets caught by the stream, and jumps
away, cursing and scowling.� But nobody
seems to care especially; it is an inevitable consequence of the pear's
insertion.

����������� Tina
lies on the frame, helpless, the pear resting inside her.� Her ribcage shifts fast.� Her skin is shining.

����������� Finally
gathering his composure, Austin returns to his task.� &quot;I'll ask you one more time,&quot; he
growls.� &quot;Where is Matmos?&quot;

����������� Tina:� &quot;I don't know.&quot;

����������� Austin
grasps the ornate turn-key of the pear, and gives it a quarter twist.� Inside her, the pear creaks open slightly,
and Tina gives a groan. �&quot;Oh,
God!&quot;

����������� &quot;I'll
ask again.� Where is his hideout?&quot;

����������� &quot;...
I don't know, I swear �!&quot;

����������� Another
turn.� Tina's groan is louder.� I can�t imagine the feeling.� The device itself is already oversized, and
with every minuscule expansion, the agony must increase exponentially.� This is the kind of technique I have always
endorsed: rather than repetition of pain, like the whip, or prolonged pain,
like breast-hanging, here each refusal to cooperate is met by greater and
greater agony, a slow, measured increase.�


����������� &quot;Oh
God � stop �&quot; Tina is begging.�
&quot;Fuck � it hurts, it really hurts �!&quot;

����������� But
Austin turns the handle again: this time, Tina's cry is more pained.� I can visualise the pear's four segments
gradually flowering outwards; blades that spread gradually wider, distending
her most intimate cavity.� She is
moaning, mewling softly to herself.� I
can see that the pain is immense, but she is trying to focus through it.

����������� I
glance at the others.� Zell has his arms
folded, a look approaching satisfaction on his face.� Steve looks vaguely distracted, as if
imagining lighting a fire beneath Tina's feet.�
Kelley, alongside the torture frame, is watching intently, her eyes
flicking from Tina's spread legs, to Tina's agonised face.

����������� Austin
turns the pear's handle again.� This
time, Tina gives a scream.� Her head is
tipped back, I can see her face shining with sweat, her eyes wild and staring
at the ceiling.� She is unable to
struggle, unable to do anything but lie there and feel the torture that ravages
her body.� Already there is a hint of a
bulge above her tidy pubic thatch.

����������� &quot;Where
is he?&quot; Austin shouts.� &quot;Tell
us where Matmos is!&quot;� He twists the
handle, the pear's metal blades force her vagina fractionally wider, and Tina's
screams echo in the torture chamber. 

����������� Kelley
moves to stand by the top of the torture frame, so that she is looking directly
down into Tina's barely-focusing eyes.�
Bending, she� takes Tina's face in
her hands,� making soft 'shh' noises
until Tina's screams fade into whimpers.

����������� She
says gently, &quot;come on, Tina.� Do you
really think you can hold out?� It's
over.� It's over for you, it's over for
Matmos.� Tell us where he is!&quot;

����������� Somehow,
despite the agony, Tina manages to hiss, &quot;go to Hell.&quot;

Kelley
glances at Austin.� &quot;Give it to
her.&quot;

����������� He
twists the handle; once, twice, three times.�
Tina's screams are dreadful, and on the third turn, I hear a muffled
'pop.'� I don't want to speculate on what
that sound means, but the bulge in Tina's lower abdomen has grown visibly.� I see blood seeping along the thread of the
pear's handle.� This time, Tina doesn't
stop screaming, but draws breath only to scream again.

Now,
Austin twists the handle slowly, milking every desperate, agonised shriek from
Tina as her vagina is brutally distended.�
&quot;Stop!� Oh, god,
stop!&quot;

����������� The
pain must be beyond all endurance; but Austin has no intention of
stopping.� He again twists the handle;
again the pear expands, stretching her vaginal walls.� Tina screams and howls at the top of her
lungs, until her voice is hoarse.

Beneath
her screams, I hear more cracking, popping sounds; the pear is now, quite
literally, tearing her.� I feel a twinge
of sympathy within my own body, and I can see Kelly's hand wander to her lower
belly.

����������� Austin
turns the pear's handle a little further.�
Tina howls and screeches, shaking her head over and over, her stretched
body shining as the bulge in her abdomen grows.�


����������� It
seems to go on and on.� Austin and Kelley
asking the same question, over and over again; and each time Tina refuses to
answer, the pear is turned a little further.�
Tina screams and shrieks in agony.

Half an
hour after the torture began, Tina lies, stretched out, wet with sweat.� Half of the pear's handle seems to have
disappeared inside her.� Blood trickles
along the screw-thread of the handle,�
runs down between her buttocks and over the iron frame on which she
lies.� More has splashed to the floor below.� Her lower abdomen is distended visibly, the
shining skin between her hip bones stretched by the half-open device inside
her. 

&quot;That's
far enough,&quot; Kelley says.� &quot;Now
fuck her with it.&quot;

Austin
gives a smile and grasps the handle once again.�
Tina begins shrieking and begging.�
&quot;No � no � I swear I don't know where he is, I swear, I
swear!&quot;

Her
pleas dissolve into a terrible scream as Austin rocks the pear gently.� The pain must be unimaginable, and Tina's
screams sound inhuman.� The act of
shifting the pear inside her makes her entire body move on the frame, the
shackles jamming against her wrists and ankles.�
She shakes her head with the agony.

Austin
pauses.� &quot;Talk!� Tell us where Matmos is hiding!&quot;

But
Tina can not reply.� She can only shriek
and sob and wail in pain; but then, suddenly, her voice trails off into a faint
squeal, then stops entirely.

&quot;She
has fainted,&quot; Kelley reports.

Austin
looks grim.� &quot;It's not over
yet.� Bring the generator.&quot;

&nbsp;

����������� Tina
awakens after only a couple of minutes, but lies barely aware of her
surroundings for a while longer, her head turning, moaning endlessly.

����������� Kelley
is standing behind the frame, and gently takes Tina's head in her hands,
lifting it from the lattice frame so she is forced to look along her own
body.� She can see the swelling of her
own lower belly from the pear inside her; but it takes a few seconds more for
her to notice the red wire that trails from between her widely-spread legs,
across her thigh, to the control unit on a gurney alongside the torture frame. 

����������� &quot;Take
a good look, Tina,&quot; Kelley purrs, as Tina starts hyperventilating in utter
panic.� I can see her stretched arms
suddenly straining to get free of the manacles that hold her, as she realises
what is about to happen.� Kelley says,
&quot;if you don't give us the names we want, Austin is going to electrify the
pear.&quot;

����������� &quot;It
will be pain unlike anything you have experienced,&quot; Austin warns.

����������� &quot;If
you don't tell us where Matmos is, you will go insane.� You won't die, Tina, but you will sink into a
nightmare and never emerge.� Do you want
that, Tina?&quot;

����������� &quot;Please,
why won't you believe me?� I don't
know!&quot; Tina wails in her misery. She is crying again, whooping sobs, a
truly broken woman.� I bite my lip.� It is becoming evident that she tells the
truth; but this is not my session to control.�
Tina belongs to Austin and Kelley; painfully and inescapably restrained,
presented, and helpless for whatever tortures they choose for her.

����������� Kelley
lets Tina's head drop.� Austin turns a
dial, charges the generator.� He takes
hold of a small lever, closes it casually.

����������� Despite
the strain in her limbs, Tina's back arches.�
New pain, diabolical pain, white hot pain explodes deep inside her.� She begins screaming, screaming and
shrieking, helplessly, in agony.

����������� When
Austin stops the current, Tina falls to the torture frame, again in a
faint.� But after a few moments, she
groans, stirs again.� I know that every
nerve must be jarring with the aftermath of the electric shock as the current
found its exit through her limbs.

����������� &quot;Goddamn,&quot;
Zell says, &quot;that was the sexiest thing I ever saw!&quot;

����������� &quot;Right,&quot;
Steve agrees readily.

����������� Austin
speaks.� &quot;I'm warning you,
Tina.� Loosen your tongue or lose your
mind, it's your choice.&quot;

����������� Tina
is panting hard.� Panic.� She tries to struggle, but she is too tightly
stretched, and can only beg:� &quot;Please,
please don't, please ...&quot;

����������� &quot;Five
hundred volts.&quot;

����������� Tina's
back looks as if it will break as her hips lift from the table.� She is screaming insanely.� Her joints make loud popping noises as her
own body stretches itself in a helpless arch.�
Electricity thunders through the pear into her vagina, delivering pain
beyond description.

����������� When
the current stops, she falls heavily.�
For a few moments, she doesn't even breathe.� A wisp of steam � or smoke � curls up from
between her legs.� I can smell the sweet
odour of searing sweat.� Her shining
limbs are shaking.

����������� When
Austin closes the switch again, there is an audible thump.� Tina's body arches again, and in the
split-second before she starts screaming, I can hear her very bones and
ligaments creaking.� Then come her
screams: shrill and demented, utterly inhuman, like the shrieking of Hell
itself.� Little blue sparks are flashing
between her legs as current burns into her vagina.

����������� It
stops.� She falls.� Her head rolls from side to side.� The sweat is running from her naked body.

����������� &quot;Where
is Matmos?&quot; Kelley demands.

����������� &quot;Where
is Matmos?&quot; Austin shouts.

����������� Tina
makes no reply.� Her jaw is slack, there
is blood around her lips; she has bitten her own tongue in agony.� Her eyes roll in her head, unseeing.� Her fingers are held in helpless claws.� She has lacerated her wrists and ankles on
the fetters that hold her stretched on the torture frame.

����������� Austin
closes the switch.

����������� Sparks
snap viciously around the protruding pear handle and Tina's pelvis thrusts into
the air as if she's having the orgasm of her life; but her screams tell of a
nightmare of pain beyond imagination.�
Now I can see there is smoke coming from her vulva.

����������� Austin
stops the current, and Tina flops, her limbs shuddering.

����������� Enough.

����������� &quot;Stop,
for God's sake, stop!&quot; I shout.�
&quot;She doesn't know!� You're
going to kill her!� No more shocks!&quot;

����������� Austin
and Kelley are staring at me.� Tina lies
there whimpering, utterly broken.� If she
knew where Matmos is, she would have told them ages ago.

����������� &quot;She'll
talk,&quot; Kelley says with confidence.�
&quot;Allielle said �&quot;

����������� Austin
realises, and shakes his head.� &quot;No,
Kirsten's right.� She doesn't know.&quot;

����������� If
I thought it would do any good, I would encourage them to keep going.� But Tina lies there, her bruised breasts
heaving spasmodically, barely conscious.�
Torturing her more would be as pointless as torturing a fly.

����������� &quot;Take
the pear out, take her off that thing, throw her back in her cell.� I'll go and do the paperwork.&quot;� It is an effort to hide my disappointment.

&nbsp;

����������� It is
a perfect day for a hanging.�������� Low
clouds filter a gloomy, grey-tinged light across the Chateau, and a chill wind
rustles the red-brown leaves of the trees that border the amphitheatre. That
same wind whistles through the hangman's noose that dangles from the gallows
above the wooden scaffold, making it sway as if an invisible corpse still
twists slowly beneath it.�� The
temperature is sixty Fahrenheit at most, far too cold for the outfit I have
selected: a tight black leather dress, halter-neck, miniskirt hem. It creaks
when I breathe. But it is the colour of mourning. Out of respect for the
condemned, I will wear it regardless.������� From
my window, I look down over the amphitheatre. It is full; easily 1500 have come
to see this, the execution of Tina deDance. Once, she was one of the most
outspoken and passionate of the Witchseekers. As Oberon's right hand, she was a
formidable Dungeon Mistress, and the first to raise her voice against him. On
the strength of her accusation, he was arrested, interrogated, convicted, and
sentenced to death.��� But Tina was not
the pure and righteous Witchseeker she pretended to be.� Beneath the veneer, she was in league with
Matmos, The Man In Black - a powerful warlock who, by his own admission,
seduced innocent women and turned them into witches, then allowed them to be
caught and executed, deriving an obscene pleasure in their long and agonised
deaths at the stake.����������� Attempts
to locate Matmos through Tina failed.�
Since then, she has languished in a cell, from where she has made the
occasional attempt to cause an uprising.�
She has failed, of course; but her attempts cannot be ignored, nor
tolerated, and today there are items upon the scaffold that do not appear
related to hanging. A brazier. A pail of pitch.�
A coiled rope. And a simple upright post, four feet tall. These are for
one purpose only: punishment before her execution.� She has tried to sow dissent, so an example
must be made.���� I glance at the clock on
my desk. Midday. Time for the execution to begin. I know that, down in the
dungeons, Tina is having her hands bound behind her back, and is being led, naked,
out of the cell that has been her home for the last few weeks. Up the narrow,
slimy stairway to see daylight for the last time.��������� Steeling myself for the chill outside, I make my way
downstairs, my progress slowed by joints that still ache after my recent
experience on the wheel rack. Even with painkillers, ice-packs and deep-tissue
massage, I am still feeling it.� Zell
certainly threw all his heart into making sure my experience was authentic.

����������� The
excitement of the crowd is palpable as I walk to the scaffold. There is a cheer
as I climb to the scaffold, although whether in approval for my performance as
Witchseeker General, or merely approval for the skimpiness of my dress, I can't
tell.� But less than ten seconds after I
arrive, there is another cheer, followed by a surge of shouts and jeers: the
execution party is approaching.����������� Austin
and Steve at the front; then Zell and half a dozen guards. Between them, naked,
hobbling, pale and wretched, hair lank and loose, arms bound behind her back,
Tina. She looks so very vulnerable and lost, and keeps her eyes down.� How many times has she seen others do this
walk of shame? I wonder. How often has she mocked their misery? Now it is
her turn to feel the dire humiliation of knowing that these people have all come
to watch her die. In an hour or so, they will return to their lives,
celebrating, happy, entertained; and she will be no more, a corpse swinging in
the autumn wind.���������� Behind them all
comes Kelley, demurely wrapped in a brown robe.�� Austin
and Steve lead the ascent of the scaffold. Tina, injured by the tortures
inflicted upon her, can barely climb. She is helped by one of the guards, and
Zell, who is almost tender in his attentions.

����������� At
the top of the steps, she hesitates, and her eyes meet mine. I expected to see
hatred, or fear, or some flicker of fear; but they hold nothing. It is like
looking at the face of a corpse already. It is the only thing that could have
surprised me, and my surprise must show, because Zell glances at me with
concern.�� &quot;Mistress Kirsten, are you
all right?&quot;�������� &quot;I'm fine,
Zell,&quot; I say.

����������� Even
now I cannot identify my feelings towards Zell.�
He was only too eager to half-pull my limbs from my body on the wheel
rack, and used the opportunity to force all manner of concessions from me.� And yet I know that he would lay down his
life for me in a moment.� His motives and
loyalties are complex; unlike Austin and Steve, who would happily torture and
burn me if the opportunity arose.

����������� Bare-limbed,
I am starting to shiver in the chill, so too bad for Tina, I want to hurry her
execution up and get inside. As Tina is made to stand facing the crowd, a
thousand people openly gawking at her nakedness, I raise my hands for silence �
sending a twinge through my damaged shoulders.�������� &quot;Ladies
and Gentlemen! Fellow Witchseekers! Today we witness the execution of Tina
deDance. Once thought one of the most upstanding and honourable Witchseekers,
respected as a leader and revered as Dungeon Mistress, she betrayed us all by
her complicity with Matmos, the Man In Black.� &quot;The
sentence for her treason is death by hanging. But I have also deemed it
appropriate, considering her many minor crimes � which include harbouring and
protecting the confessed witch, Wendy Satin Blaze, and trying to spread
sedition and unrest � that Tina receive extra punishment, to be carried out
without delay.&quot;���� Tina makes a
small whimper. I turn to Kelley. &quot;Proceed.&quot;���� With dramatic flair, Kelley shrugs off her robes: beneath, she
wears a tight red PVC dress, shoestring straps, a swing-skirt playing about her
creamy thighs.� There is an additional
cheer from the men in the crowd.����� Tina's
hard-won composure begins to crumble. She sobs out loud as Austin and Zell tug
her towards the upright post that has been secured to the scaffold. As they
untie her wrists from behind her back, she tries to pull her arms free; but
while Austin holds herforearms, Zell quickly binds her wrists on either side of
the post, so that they are held at breast height, her trembling hands extending
out into the air, she facing the pole and the crowd. .������� In desperation she looks over her shoulder at me.
&quot;Kirsten, don't do this!&quot;��������� &quot;Hurry
it up,&quot; I tell Kelley, avoiding Tina's eyes.������ As Kelley begins her preparations, Tina clenches her hands
into tight fists, but Zell and Austin grasp them and force them open. With a
sweet smile at Tina, Kelley bends to pick up the tar-heavy brush from its pail.

����������� &quot;Kelley,
no!&quot; Tina shrieks.� But Kelley
begins to daub Tina's waggling fingers and thumbs with the brush, adhering the
thick black tar to them. Tina cannot pull away; she can only shout in horror
and dread, and watch as her fingers are coated in the thick, rubbery goo.� I am reminded how eager Tina had been for me
to try the tar out on Wendy, not so long ago.�������� When
Tina's fingers and thumbs are all coated thickly in tar, Kelley puts down the
brush, stands up, shifts her hair back with her hands, and goes to the brazier
for a burning torch. Releasing Tina's hands, Austin and Zell step back to a
safe distance. Tina waggles her fingers frantically, trying to flick the tar
from them; but it sticks tight.��������� &quot;Baby,
I think this is really going to hurt,&quot; Kelley says, as she grasps Tina's
right hand just below the wrist.��� &quot;Please,
Kelley, please, please please,&quot; Tina gibbers frantically, but Kelley holds
the flame to Tina's black-coated fingers, and the flames flap and flutter
around them. In moments, black smoke funnels up into the air, and the tar
begins to bubble.� The savage heat
engulfs her hand, and a gasp becomes a wail, then a shriek.����������� &quot;Oh shit! Aaaah!!&quot;����� The exposed skin of Tina's hand blisters
in the torch's flame; then the tar ignites with a crackling, hissing sound, and
Tina gives a terrible scream of pain, echoed by a cheer from the crowd. Kelley
moves the torch to Tina's left hand, quickly lighting it.�������� With both Tina's hands alight, Kelley
steps back.����� It is an astonishing
sight. Tina, naked, screaming, her wrists bound to the post with her hands
engulfed in bright balls of fire. Its coruscating light reflects in her
panic-filled eyes. She twists and flings her hands about, but it only fans the
flames.� Little fiery droplets of burning
tar and skin drip to the scaffold. 

����������� &quot;Scream,
you bitch!&quot; Kelley taunts, and jumps with delight as the torture takes
hold; even from six feet away, I can feel the heat of the flames.

����������� The
pain must be unbearable. Screaming and shrieking, Tina braces one bare foot
against the post and tries to tear herself away from the agony, but she is
unable to get free.Tears stream down her face.�
Her entire body runs with sweat as she tugs and writhes against her
bound wrists.� But, finally, her legs
give way and she sinks to her knees as her fingers continue to burn. Beneath
her howls, beneath the cheering and chanting of the crowd, I can hear the crackling
and popping of her fingers burning; I can smell her cooking flesh.

����������� Unlike
Wendy, Tina cannot confess to save herself.�
Her hands must burn completely.�
And it is not quick: the tar burns lazily, feeding on itself and slowly
consuming Tina's fingers.

����������� Long
minutes pass. Tina screams and cries while her flesh burns, her finger-bones
split and crack noisily, and more chunks of burning tar drop to the scaffold.������ It is quarter of an hour before the last
flame dies. Tina slumps by the post, her arms still stretched up to where her
wrists are bound, her forehead pressed to the wood inexhaustion and shock. Her
fingers and thumbs are completely gone, now just steaming stumps remaining;
what is left of her hands is burned to the bone. She has stopped screaming, but
moans quietly.���������� Kelley, standing nearby,
is smiling.� Her eyes are shining.� I do wish she would show a little more
decorum on such a solemn occasion; she seems to be enjoying Tina's agony
altogether too much.

����������� &quot;Prepare
the noose,&quot; I say.����� This task has
been given to Zell, and he goes to the gallows, where he is joined by Austin.
Tina's wrists are untied from the post, scored and grazed from her desperate
struggles. She sways in the grip of the guards as they bring her to stand
beneath the gallows, so that she is looking through the noose's teardrop at the
anticipating crowd. Her face is streaked with tears and sweat. She is shaking
violently.������� The guards hold her arms
as Zell stands in front of her. He takes the noose in both hands, and quickly
places the heavy loop of rope over Tina's head.�������� &quot;Wear
this as a token of my feelings for you, Sweetheart,&quot; he mutters as he
draws it snug, the coils sitting behind her nape, then moves to the other end
of the rope, joining Austin, both men ready to pull down on it, and raise Tina
up into the air.��� Tina begins to cry.
Her lip trembles, her shoulders shake, and she is sobbing uncontrollably.
&quot;I don't want to di-i-i-ie!&quot;

����������� How
embarrassing.� Not a shred of dignity
left. Standing naked in front of fifteen hundred people, she's crying like a
baby and feeling sorry for herself. I am about to remind the guards to bind her
wrists so that the hanging may proceed, when Zell says, &quot;Oh for Heaven's
sake. � This'll give my ears a much-needed rest!&quot;����������� And he and Austin haul on the rope.� By the noose around her neck, Tina is suddenly
lifted off the scaffold, the guards releasing her arms as she rises up.� Her voice changes abruptly; she sounds almost
comical as she tries to scream, her eyes bulging with pain and the sudden
increase of pressure in her head.� Her
mouth is wide open, and she draws air with a rasping whoop, her arms and legs
flailing wildly.�������� They haven't
tied her hands! �The objection lodges
in my throat as Zell and Austin hoist Tina a little higher, so that her
twirling toes are a foot above the scaffold. Quickly, they loop the free end of
rope about the iron stay to secure it.��������� &quot;Uhhhh
� oh � oh �&quot; Tina is croaking, and, to my horror, her charred hands
automatically go to her neck, and palms and bones begin tearing at the rope.
Despite having no fingers or thumbs, and despite the horrendous burns she has
suffered, panic drives her to paw at the noose that has lodged under her
chin.� Her neck appears to stretch as she
dangles there; her body twists from the creaking rope, and she continues to
gasp and whoop loudly.� I feel my heart
pounding. I am transfixed with horror. Still the raw stumps of Tina's hands
scrape at the noose, leaving a horrible residue of burned skin on the
hemp.� I look to Zell, but he seems
enthralled by her struggles, like a little boy watching a bug slowly drowning
in a bowl of water. &quot;Uhhhh �&quot;
Tina rattles.�������� How long has it
been?� Two minutes?� Four?�
The rope creaks as Tina sways beneath it like a grotesque pinata.� The gallows post itself groans and shifts
with her swinging weight.� Her face is
flushed, her eyes bugging, her lips are puffed as if in arousal.�� But the awful gasping noises still come from
her throat, and she continues to kick and strain with her feet, reaching her
toes for the scaffold.��������� I glance
at Kelley, by the brazier. She has one hand at her own neck, her eyes wide, awe
and delight on her face.� Zell, near her,
appears equally enchanted.� Even the
crowd has fallen quiet, and I can hear Tina's gasps clearly. Blood from her
burned hands begins to stain the rope around her neck. �Somehow she is managing to stop the noose from
truly strangling her, and the effects are gruesome beyond description.�������� I can't take any more.� &quot;For fuck's sake, someone tie her
hands!&quot; I shout. There is hesitation, so I turn to one of the guards.
&quot;You! Bring the rope, tie her goddamn hands!&quot;������� As the guard fumbles for rope, Zell, emerging from his
trance, goes in confusion to the end of the hanging-rope. Before I can stop
him, he has loosened it from the iron stay, and lets Tina drop to the wooden
scaffold.� Her legs buckle and she thumps
down onto one hip. The rope loosens around her neck, and she claws it away from
her throat, gasping air, drool spilling from her mouth.���� &quot;Oh, God,&quot; she howls between breaths.�������� It is a monumental fuck-up.���������� &quot;What the hell did you do that
for?&quot; I hiss at Zell.��� &quot;But
you said �&quot;��������� &quot;I said to
tie her hands, not to let her down!&quot;��� The
guard with the rope gingerly takes Tina's arm, and, avoiding her mutilated and
bloody hand, tries to wrap it around her wrist.�
Tina tugs dazedly against his grasp, so I rush to assist.� &quot;Fuck, I can't
believe this!� Hold her arms!&quot;

����������� With
the guard holding Tina's arms behind her back, I lash her elbows tightly
together, painfully wrenching her shoulders back.� She would probably be able to pull her
charred hands free of any binding, so this is the only sure way.� Tina is�
moaning, sobbing, pleading and shaking her head. 

����������� &quot;Kirsten
- I'm begging you, not like this, not this way, please!&quot; she gasps as I
fasten the knots on her elbows.�
&quot;End it now, kill me please!�
You can do it, Kirsten!&quot;

����������� &quot;You
will hang until you are dead,&quot; I tell her simply.� I hope nobody notices how my hands are
shaking; no matter how I might want to be rid of my enemy, this is not the way
I wanted her execution to happen.�
&quot;Goodbye, Tina.&quot;�
Hurriedly I signal Zell and Austin to hoist her up again.

����������� &quot;No
�� uhhh �&quot;� Tina�
makes a choking sound as the rope draws tight, cinching the noose around
her neck again; a moment later she is wrenched to her knees, her head forced
forward; then her knees rise off the scaffold, and she scrabbles to get her
feet under her.� But Zell and Austin pull
once more on the rope, and Tina, for the second time, swings up into the air.

����������� Her
eyes bulge again; her mouth opens, and she begins choking loudly. At once, she
is trying desperately to free her arms, her shoulders writhing, the muscles in
her arms straining as she attempts to pull her bound elbows apart.� But all she can do is flap her lower arms and
flipper-like hands about behind her, her bare feet kicking and sweeping through
the air.������� Watching Tina dying makes
me suddenly conscious of my breathing, and I fill my lungs deeply, savouring
the freedom to do so.� The truth is, it's
a relief to see her finally put to death, after all her taunting and posturing,
her efforts to turn popular opinion against me.

����������� Long
seconds pass, rolling into minutes, before I realise that something still isn't
right. I glance at Zell. There is a serious bulge going on in his pants, his
face is like a little boy's at Christmas time, and a horrible realisation dawns
on me. Tina hadn't been avoiding strangulation by pawing at the noose: the rope
is simply too thick, the knot is too stiff, leaving the noose barely tight
enough to kill her. �It is Zell's gift to
her for attempting to turn him against me.

����������� It is
too late to do anything about it, now.�
She will die eventually.� But
Tina's awful struggles go on and on, her kicking legs, her flapping forearms.� Her face slowly flushes red as she twists and
thrashes on the end of the rope. The noose has wedged itself up under her jaw,
levering her mouth wide open so that her tongue protrudes oddly, and
emphasising the slow stretching of her neck. The growing pressure inside her
head makes her eyes bulge wider, a caricature of her agonised expression.� Still the hideous croaking, rasping sounds
come from her throat.  In utter
desperation, she lifts her knees towards her chest, as if it might somehow
relieve the excruciating pressure around her neck. �Of course, it is a useless waste of energy,
and one leg drops, then the other, and all she has done is expose her pussy to
a few hundred delighted onlookers.������ I
can begin to understand the others' fascination.� I am amazed that Tina doesn't just surrender to
the inevitable. I watch the way her small, high breasts jiggle on her ribcage
as she struggles.� I watch the small
circles her bare toes describe through the air as she flails her feet about,
high above the wooden scaffold.� I can
hear the creaking of the rope from which she hangs, and the squeaking of the
rope binding her elbows together as she continues to tug at her bonds.

����������� Four
minutes.� Tina's struggles are weakening.
She is still weakly trying to pull her arms from behind her back, still
twisting her hips about, still searching hopelessly with her toes through the
empty air.� One knee, or both, rise up
from time to time, then drop.� But
slowly, mercifully, the rope is drawing tighter, cutting off her air
supply.� Her neck has extended visibly,
pale and delicate in contrast to the crimson of her face.����� Her gasps are faint, now, barely any air
making it past the constricted noose. Her eyes, wide, bulging, seem to stare
out across the crowd in an eternal look of sheer terror, as if she sees the
demons of Hell already clamouring for her soul.

����������� Seven
minutes.

����������� Tina's
arms, finally, are relaxed, as if she is at last resigned to death.� Her struggles have weakened to little more
than shudders, her feet turning and twitching, only her face still showing her
agony. I am looking up at her eyes when the last of her life seems to ebbaway,
her eyelids drooping half-way over the irises, a last odd rattle escaping her
throat, her shining tongue protruding from her wide-open mouth.

����������� There
is one final, violent shudder, and then she swings limply.

����������� &quot;Christ,
that took a long time,&quot; Kelley says, and there is relieved laughter in
agreement from all around.� She is the
first to approach Tina's swaying corpse, slapping its ass playfully and raising
laughter and whistles from the crowd.

����������� I
laugh, too.� I realise that despite my
lack of covering on this cold autumn day, I have been sweating, and it is an
immense relief to know that Tina is actually dead.� I feel elated, the victory-rush of winning;
knowing how badly Tina wanted to see me brought down, and yet it is her naked
body that twirls and twitches from the gallows.

����������� The
tools of Tina's punishment are carried down from the scaffold, and I return to
the warmth of the Chateau, pouring myself a glass of Chardonnay and perching on
my window sill. Below, Tina deDance's petite corpse still hangs from the
gallows, elbows bound behind its back, lifeless legs swaying slightly in the
wind.������� I wonder if I will miss her
taunts?������� Not likely.

Part 8 - Oberon

&nbsp;

����������� A week in the damp, chill, claustrophobic confines of a
lightless cell has done little to quell Oberon�s incessant ranting.� As he is brought to the torture chamber, his wrists
locked in heavy manacles behind his back, chains clinking on his ankles, he
lambastes and curses those guards escorting him � threatening them with
agonising deaths for their disloyalty.

����������� But nothing prepares me for the look of pure venom on his
face when he sees me.

����������� �Witch!� You
scheming, double-crossing traitorous vixen!�
Look at you, dressed like a shameless whore and salivating at the chance
to throw me onto the rack!�

����������� Dressed like a whore?�
Me?� I thought I had dressed
appropriately for the circumstances.� A
plain white sleeveless blouse, and a short black leather skirt, with
calf-boots.� More or less what I might
wear to the office.� Not much defence
against the cold of the dungeons, but at least I look hot.� 

����������� I decide to let Oberon's insult pass.� &quot;Save your breath, old man.� You're going to need it once your questioning
starts.&quot;

����������� &quot;You gutless usurper, this has nothing to do with
questioning!&quot; Oberon spits.�
&quot;You just wanted the chance to be alone with me in this warped
playpen of yours!&quot;

����������� &quot;If I wanted only that, you'd have been screaming on
the rack days ago,&quot; I snort in reply.�
Oberon's eyes dart, only briefly, to the dark wooden shape that looms on
the far side of the room.� I know him
well enough to see that he is afraid, despite his outward defiance.� I stand flanked by the bear-like Austin, and
two guards.� Four more stand beside and
behind Oberon himself.

����������� &quot;I have nothing to say to you,&quot; Oberon says,
and this time his voice hints at resignation.�
&quot;You've already condemned me.&quot;

����������� I nod.� &quot;Perhaps.� The evidence against you is certainly strong,
thanks largely to Tina.� But there is
still much we need to discuss.� For
example: on May twenty-ninth this year, you had Daffy, a confessed witch,
burned at the stake.� On June sixth, the
witch Allielle suffered the same fate.�
And yet, we now know these witches never burned.� Why did you spare their lives?� What pact did you make with them � and who
were the unfortunates who burned in their place?�

����������� Oberon remains tight-lipped, so I continue:

�On July sixth,
three 'witches' were arrested by you, convicted and burned, after 'questioning
by a trainee dungeon master' who was never named, and whom I doubt even
exists.� Whatever happened to them during
their time in the chateau, it certainly wasn't in the torture chamber.&quot;

Oberon's eyes
reveal nothing.

&quot;On July
twelfth, you arrested a mother and daughter.�
You burned the mother immediately at the stake, on the strength of her
husband's accusation.� A day later you
took it upon yourself, claiming that Tina and I were both otherwise occupied,
to stretch the unfortunate daughter on the rack until she confessed.� Then, against all the rules of conduct, you
dismissed the guards and assistants, and spent a number of hours alone with
her.� The next day she, too, was burned
at the stake.

&quot;These five
souls were not the only ones to suffer such treatment.� Where is your evidence to back up your
actions?� For that matter, who were these
unfortunate women?�

����������� �They were convicted witches who needed to burn,� Oberon
says.

����������� �You see, I talked to Wendy Satin the day before she was
to burn,� I say.� �She told me that you
had spared the lives of Daffy and Allielle in return for their sexual slavery
to you.� She told me that there had been
others, too.� Some who gave their bodies
freely to you on the promise of mercy, only to be burned at the stake
anyway.� She told me that you had also
had contact with Stacy Sambilay, an accused witch, seeking sexual favours?�

����������� �And you would believe the lies of a witch?�

����������� �I didn�t,� I say, �until she announced, the day after
she supposedly burned, that she was alive - and that her own innocent cousin
had burned in her place.� Nobody has the
power to make that kind of switch � nobody but you, Sir!�

����������� �Is that the best your twisted mind could come up with?�
Oberon growls.

����������� �So tell me what really happened, then.��� 

����������� &quot;I'm not telling you a damn thing,&quot; Oberon
says.� &quot;I don't recognise any
authority in you.&quot;

����������� &quot;Oh, you'll recognise it,&quot; I say calmly, then
order the guards:� &quot;Strip him.&quot;

����������� There is a long pause.

����������� The guards look at me.�
I look at Oberon.� Oberon looks at
me.� Then I look at the guards.

&quot;Do we have
to?&quot; Austin asks me.

����������� I sigh.� &quot;It's
standard procedure in preparing a prisoner for interrogation, so yes, you have
to.&quot;

����������� The manacles are unlocked from Oberon's wrists, and
reluctantly, the guards pull the dungeon-grubbied robes from his body.� He's in good shape, considering; but that
doesn't save him from looking suddenly vulnerable, even though he makes no
effort to conceal his nudity, his flaccid penis, sleeping in its dark nest of
hair. 

����������� &quot;Are you happy now?&quot; Oberon growls at me.

����������� &quot;Thrilled,&quot; I say.� To the guards: &quot;bind his wrists, and
bring him.&quot;

����������� Oberon isn't exactly old; but I doubt his body would have
the resilience of the young witches he seems to favour.� So I have decided to avoid most of my usual
methods of persuasion, at first at least, in favour of something less damaging,
but still very unpleasant.

����������� The interrogation chair is a large iron construction
resembling a barber's chair, with wide armrests, fitted with hasps and
manacles.� Oberon's face is grim, a
battle not to show trepidation as he is forced into the chair.� With his wrists bound before his body, he is
helpless to fight as manacles lock his ankles in place, and an iron hoop is
closed about his neck, to hold him firmly.

����������� I hold up the device in my hand, so he can see it.� &quot;Do you know what this is, Oberon?&quot;

����������� He nods.� A
thumbscrew.

����������� So simple; little more than a couple of tiny iron bars on
a threaded screw, which, when turned, closes the bars together.� It is no more than four inches wide, would
weigh only an ounce.� And yet, as I'm
sure Oberon knows, can be trusted to produce most effective results.

����������� I am so close that Oberon can smell my body's fragrance,
his eyes flicking to the smooth bare skin of my shoulders and arms, then to my
throat, finally returning to my eyes.� He
swallows.� I have always known that he
desires me, and now, to be naked and powerless in my presence, he is
aroused.� I notice it in the slight
stirring of the sleeping ogre between his thighs, the wavering of his gaze.

����������� But his arousal is about to be cruelly extinguished.

&quot;Hold his
arms,&quot; I order.

����������� As two guards grab Oberon's bound hands and pull them
forward, grasping and twisting his hands so that his trembling thumbs are
thrust out side by side, the disgraced Witchseeker General glares up at
me.� &quot;Be warned.� I will revisit every moment of this upon you,
you scheming witch, and more besides!&quot;

����������� &quot;Whatever,&quot; I say, and fit the thumbscrew over
his thumbs, pushing it beyond the knuckles.�
It takes a half dozen full turns to close the iron snugly on; then I
give another half-twist, and the little bars begin to squeeze.� Oberon scowls.� Another turn, and they crunch harder; one
more turn, and Oberon jolts against his restraints, tries to pull his hands
away from me.� The ends of his thumbs are
already growing dark.

����������� I fix my eyes to his.�
�This,� I tell him, �is going to hurt a lot.�

����������� I twist the screw again, and the thumbscrew compresses
the bones of his thumbs.� Oberon sucks
air through his teeth, and begins to shake.�
Sweat suddenly appears across his brow.�
I turn the screw slowly, now, knowing that every fractional increase in
pressure brings intense pain.� Oberon
grunts, his jaw tight, his cheek twitching.

����������� �What deal did you make with Daffy and Allielle?� I
demand.� �Why did you let them live?� What of the mother and daughter you
burnt?� What evidence is there that they
were witches?� Who can verify that they
were convicted?� What happened, when you
questioned the daughter alone?� Talk, or
suffer the consequences!�

����������� �Go to hell,� Oberon hisses through his pain.� I twist the screw, and he gives a gasp with
the pain in his compressed thumbs.� A
droplet of sweat slides down his face.�
His naked shoulders and chest are shining.� �You can break my bones, it won�t make any
difference!�

����������� �We�ll see about that,� I say, and turn the screw
again.� Through a closed mouth, Oberon
growls his reaction, enduring the agony.

����������� �Talk,� I demand.�
�Tell me the truth!�

����������� �You don�t want the truth,� Oberon spits, �only what you
want to hear.�

����������� �What of the three witches you arrested?� I demand.� &quot;What happened, when you had them in
your chamber?&quot;

����������� �It's none of your fucking business,� Oberon grunts.

����������� �Let's make it my business!&quot; I shout at him,
and turn the screw.� There is a �crack from his right thumb, the sound of
splitting bone, and Oberon barely stifles a shout of pain.� Composure, when it returns, takes all of his
willpower.

����������� �Your time will come, Witch,� he sneers at me, though the
sweat runs on his face.

����������� I can feel my anger rising, so I rise and turn away.� �Austin, secure him for the night.� We�ll resume this tomorrow.�

����������� The hasp is freed from around Oberon�s neck, the fetters
from his ankles, and the guards wrench him up out of the chair.� With his wrists still bound and his thumbs
agonisingly compressed by the thumbscrew, he stumbles with them, but when he
sees the long suspension-chain that hangs from the ceiling, the heavy iron
padlock dangling open on the end of it, he gives a shout of rage and anguish.

����������� �You bitch!� You
sadistic goddamn bitch!�

����������� Flinching at the bone-deep pain that tortures his thumbs,
Oberon struggles as the guards snap the hasp of the padlock through the middle
of the thumbscrew.� Then Austin, at the
winch, begins to wind in the chain.�
Oberon gingerly allows his hands to be lifted up, the pain too intense
for him to pull against it.� But he is
only delaying the inevitable; as his arms are lifted higher, the strain begins
to pull on his fractured thumb-bones, and the pain visibly hits him.

����������� Austin pauses the winch with Oberon�s arms stretched
above his head.� He looks so helpless
standing there; his face taut and shining with the battle to endure, tufts of
hair in his armpits and a scattering across his bare chest, his nude body drawn
and exposed.� His cock is a limp creature
inviting the attention of my torture implements.� His belly shifts fast with shallow breaths.

����������� I draw close.� My
eyes are at the level of his throat.� I
put my hand to the firm plateau of his chest, stirring the hair with my
fingers, looking up at him.� �How does it
feel now, Witchseeker General?� To be as
helpless as those women you tormented?�

����������� Oberon does not answer.�
His eyes fix straight ahead, in an effort to ignore my proximity.� I smile, kiss my own fingertips and touch
them to his tensed lips.� Finally, I step
back and nod to Austin.� He hauls on the
winch, the chain rattles in, and Oberon, by his own compressed thumbs, is drawn
up onto his toes.� He grunts in pain; a
moment later, his body stretches out, and he is raised up off the floor.� The pain is intense, and his head rocks back,
a loud gasp of pain escaping him.

����������� �Oh � God!��
His feet kick, his toes automatically reaching for the floor; the pain
of hanging by his thumbs is quite unbearable.�
His body twists as Austin cranks him higher and higher.

����������� �We�ll give you some time to think on your predicament,
now, Oberon,� I call up to him.� �Perhaps
by morning you�ll be a little more cooperative.�

����������� Oberon gives no reply, only a grunt of pain; so, leaving
two guards to watch over him, I lead the others from the torture chamber.

����������� As Oberon is left swinging and gasping, I wonder what
thoughts are going through his mind - if indeed any can form amidst the
constant roar of agony that will be shrieking through his thumbs and arms.� He must know that he will break; he has seen
enough tongues loosened by my expertise.�
Does anything but a dogged sense of stubbornness keep him from blurting
out the truth?

����������� In the comfort of my chamber, I pour a chilled
Chardonnay, switch on the monitor, and zoom the camera in on the suffering
man.� His entire weight borne by two little
iron bars crushed onto his thumbs, Oberon hangs, unable to remain still.� His head lifts and rocks, his feet
pedal.� His taut body gleams with sweat,
and his muscles are stark and pumped from his struggles.

����������� I am no sadist.�
But beneath my blouse, I feel my nipples harden; I feel the unmistakable
thrill between my thighs as I watch him.�
The play of light across his body, the intensity of his expression.� It's not hard to see how, in the course of
his duties, Oberon was seduced by the shining, writhing, suffering bodies of
the young witches he had caught.

����������� Enough.� I switch
off the� monitor, and turn to my
paperwork.

&nbsp;

����������� By morning, my monitor shows a different picture.� Oberon no longer struggles.� After hanging for twelve hours by his thumbs,
he is exhausted by the pain.� Over his
long hours suspended, the fiery lava of agony has spread, from his tormented
thumbs, down through the muscles of his arms, the joints of his shoulders, down
his back.� Ripples of pain that seem to
gnaw along the bones, until he would shear his own arms from his body if he had
the choice.� And while the agony is
great, his ability to fight it has all but gone.� His head droops, his toes point loosely towards
the flagstones below him.� His body,
still oiled with sweat, is motionless.

����������� While the fallen Witchseeker General remains in agony, I
take my time getting ready for the day ahead.�
A long shower, shave my armpits and legs, wash my hair; then dress in a
barely-there pink baby-doll dress with spaghetti straps, so damn short that if
I do so much as shrug my shoulders, they'll know the colour of my panties.� Hell, it seems a shame not to flaunt legs as
good as mine.

����������� I take my time over breakfast - a bowl of cereal and
fresh fruit - then, just before seven, make my way down to the dungeon.� It's freezing cold, and for a moment I regret
my choice of clothing as my nipples go high-beam through the dress.� But one must sometimes sacrifice comfort for
image, and, suppressing shivers, I press on into the gloom.

����������� As I near the chamber, a whistle, from behind me.� �Check out those legs!� Baby!!�

����������� I look back over my shoulder with my brightest
smile.� It is the mountainous shape of
Austin, dressed in black, with leather fingerless gloves and a cloak to defend
against the cold.� I am careful to accept
his compliments graciously; they seem innocent enough, but always, in the back
of my mind, I wonder what if?� What
if, by a simple twist of fortune, it was me chained naked in a dank and
lightless cell?�� Austin has often spoken
of his hunger to �play� with the young witches in his care.

The thought makes me
shudder.� I can feel his eyes on my bare
shoulder blades, the nape of my neck, and as we reach the door to the torture
chamber, I unconsciously clasp my own arms around my body.

�You must be cold,�
Austin rumbles.

�I�m fine.� Really,� I tell him.� 

����������� He opens the heavy iron door.

����������� There, in the orange-lit cavern of the torture chamber,
hangs Oberon.� Naked, his toes two feet
from the ground, his body shining and limp, like a carcass of meat.� His head droops onto his chest.� His ribcage is stark, his belly drawn and
hollow.

����������� Two guards stand nearby.

����������� It is a relief to provide Austin with a distraction from
my relative lack of clothing:� �Bring him
down.� We shall resume as soon as the
scribe gets here.�

����������� When the heavy winch turns, Oberon�s head lifts; his face
is a picture of fatigue.� Dark circles
beneath his eyes, creases in his cheeks.�
He has chewed his own lips in his efforts not to scream out, and they
are encrusted with blood.� When his bare
toes hit the floor, he is too exhausted to stand, and slumps into the hands of
the waiting guards.

����������� Austin releases the padlock from the thumbscrew, and
Oberon is dragged bodily back to the interrogation chair.� He is far too weakened by his ordeal to
attempt escape, but the iron hasp is fastened around his neck regardless, his
ankles shackled to the base of the chair.�
Austin grasps the rope that still binds Oberon's wrists and jerks his
arms forward, presenting the wretched man�s tortured thumbs to me.

����������� They are a hideous sight.�
Black, grotesquely swollen, the slim iron bars of the thumbscrew all but
buried in the turgid flesh.� The swelling
from cracked bones has only heightened the agony of the screws; and I can see
that the tendons through his wrists are swollen from the unaccustomed strain of
his own bodyweight.

����������� Bending in front of him, I grasp� the thumbscrew, and twist it about, wrenching
his crushed thumbs.� Oberon gives a yelp,
a flood of adrenaline making him jolt, his eyes flying wide.� He sees me as if for the first time, and a
flicker of despair crosses his exhausted face.�
But then he averts his eyes and clenches his teeth.

����������� �You look rested,� I remark with sarcasm.

Oberon�s head
shakes.� �You evil bitch,� he rasps.� �Goddamn you.�

����������� �Oh, come now, Oberon.�
A hardcore advocate of torture such as yourself should be impressed by
my technique!�

����������� �You can go to hell.�

����������� I wrench his thumbs about again, and this time Oberon
gives a grunt of pain, all but breaking his neck on the iron hasp in his
twisting reflex.

����������� �Yes, it hurts.�
There is much I can do to you,� I say grimly.� �and whether you like it or not, you will answer
my questions truthfully.�

����������� �The scribe has arrived,� Austin says, from behind and
above me.

����������� Releasing Oberon�s tortured thumbs, I straighten and turn
to address the approaching scribe.� �You
can begin your notes with this: the idiot still refuses to talk.&quot;� I glance at Austin.� &quot;Take that thing off his thumbs.� It's a waste of time.&quot;

����������� Oberon winces as the thumbscrew is loosened.� The cracked bones shift, the circulation
floods back into his blue-black thumbs.�
He tries to move them, but the pain is too great, and he simply lets his
bound hands drop into his lap.

����������� I say, &quot;there is no option but to proceed to the
next stage of torture.� Take him to the
rack.�

����������� &quot;Goddamn you, bitch!&quot;� As the fetters are removed from Oberon's neck
and ankles, a mixture of anger and panic enters his voice.� He has seen the rack work its terrible persuasion
many times, and I know that he is afraid of what it will do.

����������� For that matter, so am I.�
I don�t know how resilient he will be.

����������� As Oberon is dragged across the torture chamber, he puts
up a fight; but he is weak from hanging for so long, and it is easy for the
guards and Austin to lift Oberon onto the mighty bed of wood.� Iron manacles are fastened about his ankles
and his wrists, until he lies on his back, limbs stretched out, naked and
exposed.

����������� When he is secured, I stand alongside the rack and look
down at him.� I make sure my eyes show
every bit of the gloating triumph I feel.�
This is a game, and I have won; I want to savour my victory, I want him
to feel the sting of his defeat.� That
was the purpose of dressing the way I did, today.� I want Oberon to see me as a goddess;
beautiful, desirable, sexual, and yet all-powerful and merciless.� He wants me as much as he fears me.� The dress I'm wearing is so short, Oberon can
see the tops of my bare thighs, the skirt flirting against the light tan of my
skin.� I lift my hair back from my face
with both hands; raising my arms accentuates my breasts in their light embrace
of pink.

����������� I make sure Oberon is looking directly into my eyes as I
tell Austin, &quot;torture him.&quot;

����������� Standing at the foot of the rack, Austin takes hold of
the wheel and turns.� The heavy axle
groans and rattles, drawing in chain, and, by the ankles, Oberon's body is
shifted on the wood.� I am smiling as I
watch his limbs straighten and pull into place, the manacles bedding against
his hands and feet, the chains drawing taut.

����������� Austin heaves.� The
roller turns.� The chains wind in.� Oberon is pulled tight � and then a little
tighter � and then a little tighter still.

����������� I hold up my hand, and Austin stops.

����������� &quot;I'm tired of asking you, Oberon,&quot; I tell
him.� &quot;We both know you've been
corrupt all this time.� We both know
you've been abusing your power; to fuck helpless women, then burn them.� Frankly, I already have enough evidence to
chop your head off tomorrow if I want.�
But I still want to hear it from your own mouth.� I'm going to make you say it.� You're also going to tell me where Daffy and
Allielle are; and the moment your headless corpse has stopped twitching, I'm
going to burn them both at the stake, the way they should have burned months
ago.&quot;

����������� Oberon is utterly helpless.� I can see it in his eyes.� He knows that suffering is inevitable, and
yet he is too proud to give in.�
&quot;You can shove it up your ass, witch.� I'll never talk.&quot;

����������� I put my hands on my hips.� &quot;So be it.� Austin; stretch him.&quot;

����������� Austin heaves on the wheel, and the roller turns again.� This time, as the great, creaking machine
stretches Oberon's body, he winces.�
Another notch, and I see his belly draw hollow, his ribcage lifting as
the strain builds.� One more notch, and
he gives a soft grunt.� I can see that
every muscle is rigid in a battle to defy the power of the rack.

����������� &quot;Hold it,&quot; I tell Austin.� &quot;Scribe, note that we will now pause for
a time.� We return in four hours to
resume the questioning.&quot;

����������� &quot;Goddamn you,&quot; Oberon groans.

����������� When it comes to the rack, Oberon probably has more
experience in its use than I.� He has
wrested the truth from many unfortunate witches with its slow persuasion.� But I know he has never before suffered on
it.

����������� I have.

����������� So I know, as I watch from the monitor in my office along
the passageway, exactly what Oberon is suffering as he lies there, an hour
after being put upon it.� And, contrary
to what one might assume, the first torment of the rack is nothing more than
fatigue.

But what exquisite,
overwhelming fatigue.� Being stretched is
not something the human body willingly accepts, and the automatic response is
to resist the stretch, to take any strain off the ligaments and joints by
tensing the muscles.� The consequence of
relaxing the muscles is immediate pain, a hot, burning sensation that seems to
flash along the very bones.� It is deeply
unpleasant.� So the muscles tense again.

����������� I can see that tension now in Oberon's legs.� His arms, exhausted from a night spent
hanging in the thumbscrews, have already lost the battle.� But his thighs and calves are taut with the
effort to stave off the growing ache deep in his knees and hips; the muscles of
his belly are tight as he tries to avoid the flashes of hot pain along his
spine.

����������� It is a battle he will lose.� He knows it as well as I.� And he knows that I am watching� him as his strength ebbs and he begins to
weaken.� Cramps spear through his body,
accompanied by the burning of ligaments as they protest the strain placed on
them.� Sweat begins to show on his bare
skin, and his fingernails dig into his palms in an effort to endure silently.

����������� But as the hours pass, I find myself watching the clock
on the wall, increasingly nervous.� I can
feel sweat under my arms.� There are
butterflies in my stomach.� This is more
than just another interrogation.� I have
taken on the Witchseeker General, the most powerful man the movement has known.� Everything I do will come under scrutiny; and
if I make a mistake, the consequences will be more than just a public
caning.� It will be torture - most
likely, I will be tortured to death.

����������� I must not fail.� I
must break Oberon.

����������� Another glance at the monitor.� Spreadeagled, stretched, naked.� Exhausted and suffering.� And yet, he still looks powerful.� Still has not let go of his composure.� Still has his pride.

����������� I hug myself against the cold, and the deeper chill of
doubt.

����������� The time finally comes, and Austin's tap on my door
signals our return to the task.� Wearing
the strongest face of confidence I can muster, I lead Austin, the scribe, and
two guards in a return to the torture chamber, where Oberon still lies, taut
and shining with sweat, upon my rack.

����������� &quot;I hope you've finally seen sense,&quot; I say
coolly.� &quot;Tell me what I need to
know, and it will go no further. �You'll
be able to walk, instead of being dragged, to your execution.&quot;

����������� Oberon's chest shifts rapidly.� His face shows the strain of long hours of
pain.� But his voice is steady.� &quot;I have nothing to say to you,
witch.&quot;

����������� &quot;Then let this loosen your tongue!&quot; I
snarl, and, moving to the wheel at the foot of the rack, crank it over.� I have to haul with all of my weight against
the resistance of Oberon's muscle and sinew; the roller turns, the ratchet
clicks three times, and Oberon's exhausted body is truly stretched.� But despite the agony that must explode along
his limbs, he makes no sound at all.

����������� I force another notch, and his head rocks back as his
body is stretched fractionally further, but still he says nothing.� 

����������� A fifth notch, and I can hear the creaking of his joints
as the rack does its terrible work.�
Oberon grunts, his teeth clenched, but does not cry out.� I watch in disbelief.� I can see the tension in his body, his
hands crunched down into the iron manacles, his feet the same.� His muscles are stark and defined, although
not an ounce of strength remains.� The
strain must feel like red hot coals bedded in his joints and along his bones,
and most victims would be screaming.

����������� Oberon gives the softest grunt, but refuses to cry out.

����������� Now I'm the one sweating.�
I look up at Austin.� &quot;Take
the wheel,&quot; I say, and move again to stand alongside the rack, looking
down at the drawn Oberon with disdain.�
&quot;Talk, or it gets worse.&quot;

����������� Oberon moves his lips.�
It takes a moment for him to find the strength to speak, and I realise
that he genuinely is in agony, but bearing it incredibly well.� &quot;I'm not one of your hysterical victims,
Smart,&quot; he hisses through clenched teeth.�
&quot;Do what you will.&quot;

����������� Goddamn you, I will!�
&quot;Austin, rack him two more notches.&quot;

����������� The rack creaks and groans like an old ship, and Oberon's
taut body stretches again.� With the
second click of the ratchet, I hear deep popping sounds from his spine, and he
draws breath with a gasp, another groan escaping his throat.

����������� &quot;You're too old for this, Oberon,&quot; I tell
him.� &quot;This veneer of bravery will
only get you into more and more agony, until you beg me to stop - but by then
it will be too late.&quot;

����������� &quot;Fuck you,&quot; Oberon gasps.

����������� &quot;Fine.&quot;�
I shrug.� &quot;We'll play it your
way.� Austin, another notch.&quot;

����������� I am sure I catch a momentary look of panic in Oberon's
eyes; then the roller groans over another notch, and his jaw clenches as the
grassy creaks of stretching ligaments and tendons signal a new height of
agony.� But still he doesn't scream.

����������� I feel a droplet of sweat slide down my spine.� 

����������� How many more notches can I give him before I have played
my entire hand?� Do I start instead with
the hot irons?� But they might send him
into shock, give him a heart attack?�
Nothing would make me look more incompetent than for him to die under
torture.

����������� Could that be his intention?

����������� I suddenly feel lost.�
For all my years of experience, I feel helpless and fragile.� What am I thinking, standing here in my
little-girl dress, threatening the Witchseeker General?� Breaking witches is one thing, but Oberon
seems beyond my abilities.

����������� I could grab the needle-nosed pliers and tear out his
toenails! �But compared to the agony
he is already feeling, they would be mere bee-stings.� I have no choice but to continue, to call his
bluff, and to hope and pray that he is only one more notch away from breaking.

����������� &quot;Again,&quot; I tell Austin.

����������� The wheel turns, and Oberon releases his breath with a
hiss as another fraction of an inch is wrested from his tormented frame.� Again I hear the creaks and groans of his
ligaments and muscles as they near breaking point.� The sweat sits in fat droplets over his skin,
runs from his furrowed brow.� His jaw is
so tight I half expect his teeth to break.

����������� But still no scream.

����������� Now I'm the one losing my composure; I realise I have
been pushing my hands through my hair in growing agitation, and it is a
mess.� There are growing sweat-circles in
my dress, beneath my arms.� I am chewing
my lip and glancing at the scribe and guards, who are also becoming
restless.� Only Austin, the patient
giant, seems unaffected.

����������� &quot;Another notch?&quot; he asks.

����������� What do I do?� Another
notch?� Or give the rack time to do its
work?� 

����������� &quot;No.� We will
adjourn, and return in an hour.&quot;� I
lean over Oberon, and grasp his face in my hand.� Even that seems a feeble gesture; my hand so
small against the strong shape of his jaw.�
&quot;When we return, I promise, you will scream for me.� I will pull your joints apart, one by one,
and laugh as you beg for mercy.&quot;

����������� &quot;I won't give you the pleasure,&quot; Oberon snarls
through his pain.

����������� I turn away quickly, and signal for Austin and the scribe
to follow.

&nbsp;

����������� I stand on the balcony of my room, looking out over the open
space below.� The large amphitheatre,
which Oberon himself commissioned, to accommodate the ever-growing audiences at
witch-burnings.� I can see the scaffold,
on which hangings and whippings and Kathy Linyd's gruesome
breaking-on-the-wheel have all been carried out.� Nearby, the great circle of scorched earth,
where so many witches have screeched in the flames.� I fill my lungs with the fresh outside air,
exhaling the bitterness of fear and angst.

����������� It's all in my head.�
Oberon is a master of mind games.�
Somehow he has found the energy and the strength to hold back his
screams, for one reason only.� He wants
me to lose my nerve.� And he almost
succeeded.

����������� Slowly, calmness returns, and with it, resolve.� I will not be defeated.� He is just a man, and like every man, he has
his breaking point.� I will find it.� I will hear him beg for mercy.� And I will have his confession. 

����������� It is with a new calmness and resolve that I return to my
office in the dungeons.� The goddess
again, sexy and aloof, calculating and ruthless.� I quietly write up my report on Oberon's
questioning.

����������� From time to time I glance at the monitor, and I can see
that Oberon is suffering.

����������� I can see his head turning from side to side.� I can see the constant shine of sweat.� I can see the occasional spasms of his belly
as he chokes his own cries of pain.� Let
him suffer, I think to myself.� Let
every minute feel like an hour; when the torture resumes, he won't be so
defiant.

����������� I make my return to the dungeon with confidence and
energy.� Austin and the scribe are again
with me, and, this time, the Witchseekers' physician.

����������� &quot;It is time to bring your na�ve game to an end,
Oberon,&quot; I say dangerously.�
&quot;Talk, or suffer the consequences.&quot;

����������� The stretched, creaking man on the rack turns his head,
although his eyes seem to have lost their focus.� His lips are bloodied and cracked.� His hands and feet are dark, almost blue with
strangled circulation; his naked body is hideously tight, spread,
vulnerable.� He looks wretched.

����������� &quot;Fuck � you �&quot; he whispers hoarsely.

����������� I put my hands on my hips.� &quot;Ha!�
Still defiant!� Austin, give him
another notch.&quot;

����������� Austin puts his big hands on the lever, and hauls.� The roller shifts, and as Oberon stretches, I
hear a familiar squeak from his left shoulder.�
A moment later, there is a deep and muted crack and the entire
joint shifts violently, his body skewing slightly on the rack and his arm
visibly lengthening.� Oberon's head tips
back, and he groans,

����������� &quot;Oh - God!!&quot;

����������� For a moment, I think he is going to scream.� But somehow he stifles it, even as the
increased tension now rips his right shoulder out of joint.� Crack!�
Austin rotates the roller a fraction to take up the extra length,
putting terrible strain on Oberon's agonised ligaments.� His armpits are up around his ears.� Fresh sweat beads up across his face, his jaw
trembles, and he makes soft grunting sounds.�
But no scream.

����������� I lean close to him.�
&quot;You're coming apart, old man.�
It's over.� Talk!&quot;� I grasp his arm and rock it from side to
side, agitating the dislocated bone and twisting his torn muscles.� Again, the barely-stifled groans and
whimpers, quick and shallow breaths hissing through his nostrils, but Oberon
refuses to break.

����������� &quot;Another notch,&quot; I tell Austin.� &quot;Make it slow.&quot;

����������� Austin pulls on the wheel again, and as the roller
shifts, I hear creaking from all along Oberon's spine.� The agony must be terrible, like red hot
hooks tearing deep into his flesh.� Now I
hear the warning sounds of his hips and elbows nearing dislocation.� Oberon groans.

����������� &quot;Can you feel it?�
Your body, tearing apart?� Don't
think this is as bad as it gets?� Once
your joints are dislocated it is a hundred times worse!� But I can stretch you further, and
further.&quot; 

����������� Oberon is fighting not to scream.� Somehow, through his rapid gasping for
breath, he manages to force a single word:�
&quot;Witch!&quot;

����������� &quot;Austin, another notch!&quot;

����������� As the roller turns, Oberon's left hip pops from
its joint with a nauseating sound.� His
belly gives a spasm with the shock of agony, and he lets out another groan, his
eyes squeezing tightly shut, and his mouth opening in a silent gasp.� I watch as his right hip-bone is wrenched
from its socket, his leg extending visibly.�
Austin is quick to rotate the roller and accommodate the dislocation,
sending fresh shards of white-hot pain through Oberon's lower body.

����������� I fix my hand in Oberon's hair, forcing his head around
so that I am staring straight down into his watering eyes.� His lids are fluttering, his face is pale.

����������� &quot;You can bite down on your screams, but you can't
hide your pain from me, Oberon.� I am
breaking you.� It's over.&quot;

����������� Oberon gives no reply.�
There is not even any sign that he has heard me.� His mouth is still open, and I realise that
his breathing has become a faint snuffling sound.� There are flecks of foam on his lips.

����������� &quot;Kirsten,&quot; the physician warns.

����������� I feel my frustration return.� &quot;I know!�
I know � dammit � he's not getting any air!&quot;

����������� Oberon has been stretched so tightly, his diaphragm can
barely shift.� He is suffocating on the
rack, right before our eyes.� For a moment,
I feel a surge of rage; I want to tell Austin to turn the lever, to pull the
bastard apart.� Instead, I let his head
drop, and say, &quot;okay, enough.�
Loosen him.&quot;

����������� Austin releases the tension on the rack, and Oberon gasps
breath, his belly and ribcage heaving again.�
Quickly, the physician directs several of the guards to help guide
Oberon's joints back into place, as, notch by notch, the stretching eases.

����������� It takes fifteen minutes to fully unwind the roller.� When it is done, Oberon lies limp like a rag doll,
exhausted, wet with sweat, his joints already swelling from the racking.� He coughs, almost vomits, still breathing
hard.� Hours of torture on the rack, and
not a single scream.

����������� &quot;Bring him,&quot; I tell the guards.� &quot;We're not done yet.&quot;

����������� I catch the eye of the physician, who sends me a warning
look.� But to give Oberon time to recover
would be to give him strength to resist.�
As the manacles are removed from his bruised and grazed wrists, I tell
the guards to bring him to the torture frame.

����������� It is iron, made of cris-crossed iron palings, like a garden trellis, eight feet square, suspended on chains
from the ceiling so that it can be angled to suit my needs.� There is a shackle-and-chain at each corner,
which can be tightened by screws, like tuning a guitar.� Too weak and in too much pain to resist,
Oberon is laid spreadeagled on the frame, shackled to it.� The chains are tightened until his ruined
joints are again put under agonising strain; his feet are a yard-and-a-half
apart, his wrists similar.

����������� In all this time, Oberon has not
said a word.� Secured, he lies on the
hard iron frame, his chest still heaving.�


����������� &quot;I don't know, Oberon,&quot; I
say, as I sort through the implements I have prepared.� &quot;Maybe you're a masochist.� Or at least too damn proud for your own
good.&quot;

����������� &quot;Give up already,&quot; Oberon
finally groans.� &quot;You won't break
me.&quot;

����������� &quot;We'll see.&quot;

����������� My selection is a device employed by Tina with great
effect on the unfortunate Bubba: the ball-crusher.� Two opposing,
slightly-concave spoons which can be clamped together with the turn of a
handsomely engraved screw. In the middle of each spoon are two spikes, about
half an inch long.

����������� My preference is always to avoid
such gross methods of torture.� But
Oberon has left me no choice.� It is
among the most psychologically distressing to a man, but seldom fatal, unlike
the pear.� I regard his limp cock, soft
and vulnerable in its nest of hair, and the delicate eggs of his balls hiding
beneath.

����������� With gentle fingers, I take one
warm, round orb between my fingers and thumb, and Oberon jolts in surprise at
my touch.� When I close the cold, heavy
iron of the first crusher over his ball and begin to tighten the screw, he
gives a whimper.� He is unable to
struggle or writhe, but his head lifts, and for the first time, I see fear on
his face.

����������� &quot;What � are you doing?&quot;

����������� &quot;If you're so fucking tough,
let's see how you enjoy having the juice squeezed, little by little, out of
your lemons!&quot;

����������� &quot;Oh God - no!&quot;

����������� I think, for a moment, he is being sarcastic, expressing
mock dread.� But as I compress the second
crusher onto his other ball and twist the screw, just enough for the spikes to
lightly press on his testicle, he gives another wail of horror.� &quot;Stop!&quot;

����������� &quot;Not a chance,&quot; I say, and twist the
screw.� The cups close, the spikes probe
and the pain leaps from his squashing ball.�
Oberon's eyes bulge and he gives a shout.

����������� &quot;No, dammit, no!�
Stop, please, stop!&quot;

����������� I look up at him.�
&quot;Are you � begging me?&quot;

����������� &quot;Yes!�
Kirsten, I'm begging you!&quot;�
Oberon's face is twisted in horror and nausea.� Fresh sweat floods his face.� He is pale.�
His fingers claw uselessly beyond the manacles that hold him stretched;
he is trying to see down between his legs, where the crushers hug his testicles
like iron clams.� &quot;Oh god, please,
don't turn the screw!&quot;��������� 

����������� I give a laugh of delight.� &quot;You mean - like this?&quot;� I twist the screw, and as the spikes push
cruelly on either side of his testicle, Oberon gives a long shout of terror.

����������� &quot;I'll talk!�
I'll talk!� Anything!&quot;

����������� I glance over my shoulder.� &quot;Scribe, are you getting all this?&quot;

����������� &quot;Yes, Miss Kirsten.&quot;

����������� I lean forward, and tink-tink-tink with my
fingernails on the iron surface of the ball crusher.� &quot;Go on, then, Oberon.� I'm listening.&quot;

����������� &quot;I admit it!�
They weren't all witches!� Oh God,
take it off, please!&quot;

����������� &quot;Not yet.�
Keep talking.&quot;

����������� Oberon nods frantically.�
&quot;Okay!� Some of them were
witches, but some weren't � at least, I wasn't sure � we suspected �&quot;

����������� &quot;What did you do to them?&quot;

����������� &quot;Anything I wanted!�
It was so easy,&quot; Oberon says.�
&quot;They would do anything to avoid torture.� That mother-and-daughter � I burned the
mother � then promised the daughter freedom, if she would have sex with
me!&quot;

����������� &quot;And then you burned her anyway?&quot;

����������� &quot;She knew too much!�
She had to burn!&quot;

����������� The truth is sickening.�
I press on.� &quot;The women in
the dungeon now?&quot;

����������� &quot;Suspected of dabbling in witchcraft,&quot; Oberon
says.� &quot;I was going to question them
privately.&quot;

I sigh.� &quot;And so � to Daffy and Allielle?&quot;

����������� Oberon's head falls back.�
&quot;I let them live, in exchange for their services.&quot;

����������� I feel my lip curl in disdain.� &quot;'Services?'&quot;

����������� &quot;They gave themselves to me, as sexual slaves, in
return for my protection.� Please, take
those things off me!&quot; 

����������� &quot;Not yet,&quot; I say.� &quot;Tell me about Wendy.&quot;

����������� &quot;I made the same deal with her.� We decided to burn her cousin in her
place.&quot;

����������� &quot;What about Stacy Sambilay?&quot;

����������� &quot;I tried � I offered to save her from interrogation �
but she wasn't interested.� Please, Kirsten,
please, take them off!&quot;

����������� I would, but this is just too good.� After quite literally making me sweat in fear
of failure, the mighty Oberon has been undone by a single nut.� I have absolute power over him, it is right
at my fingertips.� I gently agitate the
turnscrew of one crusher, so that he can feel the spikes digging into the sides
of his ball.� &quot;Can you direct my men
to Daffy and Allielle?&quot;

����������� &quot;Yes,&quot; Oberon gasps.� The hair beneath his arms is soaked with the
cold sweat of absolute terror; his eyes are huge.� &quot;Oh God, yes � anything �&quot;

����������� &quot;You will ratify and sign your confession?&quot;

����������� &quot;Yes, I swear!&quot;

����������� I pause.� Tempted. �Do you think I'm sexy? I could
ask.� Or, who is the Witchseeker
General now, bitch?� I could make him
fawn and beg and degrade himself, simply for my own enjoyment.� But in truth, my work is done.� He has broken, he has confessed.

����������� I loosen the crushers.�
&quot;Return him to his cell.�
Give him food and water.� Then
take his full confession, and make sure he signs it.&quot;

����������� As I stand, Austin gives me a congratulatory smile.� I smile back - then, despite my reservations,
give the big man a hug.

&nbsp;

����������� If today had theme music, it would be military drums.

����������� Although there is no real threat to the current
Witchseeker leadership, armed guards in camouflage patrol the Chateau grounds,
many more in the surrounding woods, marksmen posted on the roof.� A helicopter thunders overhead, flying the
grounds' perimeter, scanning with infra-red and radar for any sign of witches
seeking to rescue their doomed sisters.�
Not that any of the guards will see any action: the seething crowd has
come for one thing only.� To watch Oberon
and his two satanic concubines burn.

����������� The first two rows of the huge crowd are people with a
special interest in this day.� They are
the relatives of the innocent women abducted, tortured, raped and burned at the
stake by Oberon.� Husbands, mothers,
brothers and sisters.� Also here are the
families of those unfortunate innocents who were burned in place of Daffy and
Allielle.� Oberon claimed the victims
were witches; but they were never questioned, never given trials.

����������� In the raised ground at the centre of the amphitheatre,
the instruments of execution have been assembled.� Three wooden X's � Saint Andrews crosses �
already fitted with manacles.� A large
brazier, from which bristles long-handled irons and pokers.� A sturdy table, on which are laid various
pincers, crushers and screws, mallets and iron bars; instruments of torture
ready for use.

����������� Behind the crosses is a large bonfire-pile of wood and
straw, with three tall stakes erected at its centre.� Chains are laid ready nearby.

����������� It is a nice day; only a small breeze, and the sun is
shining.� I am wearing my black camisole
top and black skirt, the executioner's colours; although with the option of a
red blazer if the chill should get too much.�
After all, this isn't a day of mourning, but one of celebration.

����������� I stand on the scaffold, thirty feet from the waiting
crosses and stakes, ready to make my address.�
For the first time, a microphone has been set up so that I don't have to
strain my voice to be heard by the several thousand spectators.

����������� On time, the execution party emerges from the
Chateau.� Word quickly travels through
the crowd and voices rise into the afternoon air.� Twenty guards, led by Zell, Austin, and Steve,
in grey cloaks with hoods.� Kelley skips
alongside them, in a breast-plumping corset and side-split skirt, a coiled whip
in her hand.� Shuffling in chains are
three naked figures; Oberon, Daffy, and Allielle.� Seeing their approach, a chorus of boos and
hissing rises up from the crowd, jeers and taunts hurled and screamed at them.
The voices of the bereaved are the most fierce as the condemned trio shuffle
towards their execution site.

Oberon is first,
his hands shackled behind him, more fetters about his ankles, the short chain
restricting him to small steps.� Behind
comes Daffy, and then Allielle, their wrists also manacled behind their backs.

����������� Oberon looks the worst for wear.� For all his posturing and bravado while
locked in his cell, he looks a broken man already, with his thinning hair and
sagging posture.� I almost feel sorry for
him; but a scream rises from the amphitheatre towards which he shuffles.� I look, and see a woman in one of the forward
rows of seating, dressed in black, clutching her own hair and shrieking in grief
and rage at the man who had raped and burned her daughter.� The girl had not been a witch, but an
innocent young woman whose body had caught Oberon's attention and stirred his
lust.

����������� Behind Oberon is the young auburn-haired witch
Daffy.� Susannah is her true name; she is
slim and petite and beautiful, and it's easy to see why Oberon, in his
lascivious frenzy of torture, murder and sex, decided to spare her life.� Even condemned to death and about to suffer
the terrible agonies of the stake, hands manacled behind her back, there is a
haughtiness to her walk.

����������� Behind Daffy, Allielle is a gorgeous redhead,
full-breasted.� She is statuesque and
long-limbed; and it is only through dire threats and manipulation that Oberon
could ever have had a woman such as her.

����������� The condemned are led to the scaffold.� At the foot of the steps, Oberon briefly
looks up; seeing me, and immediately behind me, the gallows from which Tina's
corpse twitched its last, just one week ago.�
A snarl of defiance twists his features, and as the guards try to guide
him up the wooden steps, he throws himself backwards, trying to twist away.

����������� &quot;I won't go down without a fight, you bitch!&quot;
he shouts.� &quot;Damn you all!&quot;

����������� The guards are quick to catch his bound arms, seize his
legs; and, held struggling by four men, Oberon is physically carried up to the
scaffold.� The crowd mocks and jeers as
Oberon twists and curses.� Daffy and
Allielle climb the steps sullenly, holding on to their dignity for at least a
little while longer.

����������� On the scaffold, the three are made to kneel along its
forward edge, hands still behind them, naked, facing the crowd.� It is an exercise in sheer public
humiliation, to be openly displayed as captives, presented as one might show
off a new piece of art.� It is an open
invitation for everyone to ogle the bodies of the two women in particular, and
many in the crowd have binoculars.

����������� Allielle and Daffy have no choice but to kneel in shame
as thousands discuss their bodies; the size and shape of their breasts and
nipples, the shape of their thighs or hips or arms, the firmness of their
bellies.� Denied the luxury of razors or
even bathing for weeks now, both women's pubic and underarm hair has grown
unchecked, only adding to their humiliation.

����������� The attention is not solely on the two young women,
however.� Oberon, too, is laughed and
jeered at.� Forced to kneel naked, he too
is on show.� Warranted or not, insults
are hurled at the insignificance of his flaccid penis, his dangling balls.� I know, as Oberon does too, that soon it will
not only be words that batter his precious manhood.

����������� I can't resist the opportunity to bend close to Oberon,
so that only he can hear my words.� With
my lips next to his ear, I say, &quot;how does it feel, baby?� Today I am going to have you killed.� I'm going to watch as you die � and I'm going
to relish every moment of it.&quot;

����������� Oberon doesn't react, so I return to my place by the
microphone.� I couldn't resist it; it has
been a game of taunts, and I want him to know that I am the one with power over
him.� I am the one who will be victorious
when this day is over.

����������� When Zell, Austin, Steve and Kelley have taken their
places on the scaffold, when the guards are standing watch, and when the crowd
has had its fill of ogling and abusing, I step close to the microphone.

����������� &quot;Hello,&quot; I try, and my voice echoes across the
Chateau grounds, chased by a small squeal of feedback.� An expectant silence settles.� &quot;� Ladies and Gentlemen, Witchseekers
one and all � today isn't just another execution.� Today, we end the evil curse that has plagued
the Witchseekers group, and welcome the beginning of a new era!&quot;

����������� There is a cheer, but I hold up my hands for
silence.� &quot;For many of you, I know
it will have seemed as if the Witchseekers group was falling apart at the
seams; but the truth is that we are now stronger than ever.� Today, the last of the corruption will have
been purged forever, and we will be able to focus on the one true purpose:
witch hunts!&quot;

����������� An even bigger cheer.

����������� &quot;Let me remind you why these three are to
burn today.� First, Oberon. ����� On May 29th, he burned an innocent
woman at the stake, claiming that she was the witch Daffy; on June 6th,
another innocent woman burned in the place of the witch Allielle.� In a betrayal to all decent men and women,
both witches had been spared, in return for becoming sex slaves of the vile
Oberon.

����������� &quot;On July 6th, on July 12th,
and on many other occasions, innocent women were arrested, forced into sexual
submission, and then burned at the stake for Oberon's perverted pleasures.� While the rest of us tried to rid the world
of evil, Oberon spawned it.&quot;

����������� As I read the charges, the crowd react with boos, hisses,
shouts like burn him! and cut off his balls!� 

����������� &quot;After she had been 'recaptured' after her supposed
execution, Wendy Satin gave evidence not only that Oberon had spared Daffy and
Allielle, but that he had made the same promise to her; and hence Wendy's own
innocent cousin had been put to death by fire in her place.

����������� &quot;For these crimes and others too many in number to
mention, by the power vested in me as Witchseeker General, I sentence Oberon to
be given fifty strokes of the whip, then to be tied upon the St Andrews Cross,
where he shall be branded with hot iron, before those who lost their loved ones
to him will be allowed to wreak their retribution upon his flesh.&quot;

����������� There is another cheer.�
In front of me, kneeling on the scaffold, I see Oberon's shoulders slump
as the reality of the horror ahead sinks in.

����������� &quot;For their crimes as Witches, and for their
complicity with Oberon, I sentence Daffy and Allielle to be given thirty
strokes of the whip each, then branded, then given over to the relatives of
those they betrayed.&quot;� Another
cheer.� The three kneel motionless, their
faces down; but I know that their hearts are pounding, their bellies churning
with fear at the hideous torments that are about to begin upon their flesh.

&quot;Finally, when
the punishments have all been carried out, all three will burn alive at the
stake.&quot;

The crowd roars
approval, and as I step back from the microphone, I nod to Zell that the
punishments may now begin.� By three
guards, Oberon is hauled up onto his feet, spun around to face the rope that
dangles from the gallows.� It takes only
moments to release his hands from behind him, but bind them again in front of
his body to the suspending-rope.� Austin
and a guard draw on the gallows rope, so that Oberon's arms are drawn upwards,
higher and higher; stretched over his head, until he can barely stand on the
tips of his toes.

I move to where he
can see me.� His face is taut with strain
and fear, flanked by his own upstretched arms and the tufts of hair in his
armpits, his chest inflated with the stretch in his body.� I smile and poke my tongue at him.

It is Kelley who
takes up the whip; with a flourish and a flick of her long hair, she stands
behind the condemned man, measures the distance, then throws the whip
forward.� It snaps across his flesh with
a sound like an axe hitting wood.� Oberon
is thrown off balance by the impact, and gives a shriek of pain.� A bright red mark scores his pale flesh,
quickly punctuated by beads of blood, and Kelley whips him again.

Each stroke of the
whip must feel like the touch of red-hot iron, a savage and intense pain, and
lash after lash falls on Oberon's undefended flesh, as he twists and writhes on
the end of the rope like a hooked fish.�
He yelps and squeals as the lash curls about his torso, snaps at his
naked buttocks, flicks tiny chunks of flesh from his body.� 

����������� Kelley's pretty face is set in concentration, but her
eyes shine with sheer pleasure at the task she has been assigned; Oberon tried
to rape her, also, and this is her vengeance.�
She circles him where he hangs helpless, making sure the whip's heavy
lash smashes across his belly, his chest; cutting his nipples and digging welts
under his arms, about his thighs.� With
shouts and squeals of pain, Oberon tries to pick his knees up to protect
himself; but Kelley simply snaps the lash lower, catching him across the
buttocks.

����������� One such blow snags the dangling sack of his scrotum,
nearly tearing it off as the whip is pulled free, and Oberon's scream is
hideous.� His white flesh is now a
cris-crossing mass of red and bleeding welts; blood runs with sweat on his body
as he twists about in pain and humiliation.�
Even Daffy and Allielle, kneeling nearby, have been splashed by tiny
droplets of Oberon's blood.

����������� There is no danger that Oberon will receive any fewer
than the full fifty lashes; the crowd makes sure of that, counting each stroke
as it lands.� Kelley's skin shines with a
glow of perspiration as she works her way around him for the third or fourth
time, whipping him hard, whipping him cruelly.�
If she could kill him with the lash, she would.

����������� But finally, it is done.�
The whip slides back, leaving a smear of blood on the scaffold.� Oberon hangs with his head forward on his
chest, his body running with bloody rivulets of sweat, exhausted and moaning. 

����������� &quot;Bring him down,&quot; Zell orders, &quot;secure him
on the cross for the branding.&quot;

����������� The wretch who called me Usurper is loosened from the
gallows, and his heaving body drops to the scaffold floor.� He is scooped up roughly, and dragged down
the steps, while the crowd yells and taunts him.

����������� Allielle is next.�
The curvaceous redhead is sobbing as they reach for her, drag her to the
gallows rope.� Her wrists are tightly
bound, and then the rope is drawn in, until her body hangs several inches off
the scaffold.� Zell accepts the
blood-warmed whip from Kelley, stands ready, then throws the first lash.

����������� The whip sends a ripple through Allielle's flesh as it
strikes her mid-back, the air is flung from her lungs with a shriek, and the
crowd cheers.� Zell aims the second blow
to cross the first, laying it across vulnerable flesh.� Soon, the thwack! of the whip and
Allielle's screams resound in tortured rhythm across the amphitheatre.

����������� Below, Oberon has been secured to the X-shape of the St
Andrews Cross; his arms shackled high, his legs outstretched, and his toes some
inches from the ground.� His cock and
balls hang down in the air, as vulnerable as cherries on the lowest branch of
the tree.� He seems lost in his own
private hell, oblivious to the ongoing begging and shrieking of Allielle as she
is whipped senseless.

����������� Zell pays particular attention to Allielle's breasts;
full and sexy, they make easy targets, and each lash makes them jiggle and
jump, angry red lines like razor-scores across them.� As her breasts are whipped, Allielle loses
all control, and pisses herself; a steaming dribble winds down her swinging
legs, to spread in a puddle across the scaffold.� She shrieks in pain, while the tears of
humiliation course down her reddened cheeks.

����������� When Allielle has received her thirty lashes, she is
lowered, unbound, and dragged away to the St Andrews crosses for further
torture.

����������� &quot;Please, please, I beg you, kill me
now!&quot; she screams. 

If I had the
choice, I would execute her swiftly, mercifully; a blow of the axe to sever her
neck, or a few minutes' swinging from the gallows.� I did not choose to become Witchseeker
General; it was forced upon me, and contrary to the claims of those who oppose
me, I do not relish others' suffering.��
Except perhaps Oberon's.� Besides,
examples must be made, and these three have to be properly punished for their
crimes.� Allielle will not be granted
mercy, and I say nothing as she is dragged to the X-frame and shackled to it.

����������� Daffy is secured for the whip, her toes just brushing the
scaffold.� This time it is Austin's task,
and he takes the whip eagerly from Zell.�
Daffy, slender, petite, her auburn hair falling over her face as she
hangs beneath the gallows pole by her wrists, is barely into her twenties.� She should be flirting with boys at the mall,
or out clubbing, enjoying her youth.�
Instead, she is living a nightmare, as the big man behind her takes a
swing at her thighs with the heavy lash.

����������� Even Daffy, a powerful witch, cannot stop herself from
screaming out with the pain of the whip, and it falls again and again on her
body, scoring her flesh with savage lines, tearing her skin and leaving
sweat-diluted streaks of blood down her ribcage.� Her breasts are small and high, but that
makes them a challenge for Austin, and he shows frightening expertise, snapping
at them with the heavy braided lash, drawing welts and blood with the dozen
blows he lands.

����������� Other strokes of the whip land across her belly, her
ribcage, her back, her buttocks.� Daffy
twists and jerks, hanging by her wrists, shrieking with pain as the two before
her also did; but she, too, is helpless, and when the thirty lashes have been
given, she hangs sobbing and bloodied.

����������� She is dropped from the whipping-rope, and dragged down
to join her fellow condemned, fastened spreadeagled to the third and final
cross.

����������� &quot;Let their condemned flesh be branded in their most
secret places, as punishment for their fornication,&quot; I announce into the
microphone, and the crowd gives a cheer of approval.

����������� Oberon is on the centremost cross; Allielle on his right,
Daffy to his left.� It is Austin who
draws out the first heavy branding iron, and goes without hurry to Allielle.

����������� &quot;I beg you, please, no!&quot; Allielle
shrieks as he nears.� The brand trails
smoke in the air.� &quot;I'm sorry, I'm
sorry for everything!&quot; But she is spreadeagled and helpless, and no amount
of tugging on the shackles that hold her wrists and ankles will break her
free.� She stares in abject horror as the
iron is brought close.� I know she would
give anything in the world to escape this awful moment, but it has been decided
that she must suffer, so she will suffer.

����������� The crowd cheers as Austin presses the phallus-shaped
iron up between Allielle's legs.� Her red
pubic hair smokes and singes as the red-hot iron burns into her vulva and
clitoris, and Allielle bucks and shrieks and howls in agony on the cross.� She flings her head from side to side, the
sweat appearing in fat droplets over her entire body as smoke curls gracefully
up over her pubic mound from between her outstretched thighs.

����������� When the iron is withdrawn, smoking with the charred
residue of her flesh, Allielle goes limp, her head hanging forward.� Austin returns the brand to the brazier,
drawing out another instead.� This time,
he goes to Daffy.

����������� As he does, Zell takes another tool from the
brazier.� A great iron claw, sharp and
glowing hooks on a heavy pincer-like implement.�
The breast-ripper is hideous in name, and even more hideous in its
application.� Invisible dust particles in
the air crackle against the red-hot iron as Zell carries the device to
Allielle.

����������� Austin pushes the red-hot branding iron up between
Daffy's legs.� Daffy gives a terrible
scream of agony as she is violated by the burning metal.� Austin twists and thrusts the brand, sending
tiny skittering flames through Daffy's pubic hair, her sensitive flesh sizzling
like pork on a barbecue.� He is all but
fucking her with the iron, and she strains every muscle against her restraints,
pumping her hips in a desperate effort to escape the torture.

����������� Her screams are suddenly echoed by Allielle's, as Zell
closes the breast-ripper onto the unfortunate redhead.� The claws of the ripper sink into Allielle's
breast, and as Zell twists and tugs, her breast seems to swell and grow with
the heat and steam that fills it.� The
whole cross to which she is shackled shakes as she struggles and howls.

����������� Daffy is hanging limply.�
Smoke and steam still curls from between her outspread and shining
thighs.� Austin returns the brand to the
brazier; but fresh screams ring out as Allielle's remaining breast is suddenly
ravaged by the ripper, her skin searing, agony beyond belief making her voice
sound barely human.

����������� Kelley has the phallus-shaped iron, now, and looks
directly at Oberon.� The ageing
Witchseeker lifts his head and tries to muster a look of defiance, but his fear
shows clearly through.� Without hurry,
Kelley circles the St Andrews Cross on which Oberon is fastened.� Then, dipping as if into a curtesy, she
thrusts the iron up between the lower struts of the cross, directly between
Oberon's outspread legs.

����������� The term squeal like a pig comes to mind as Oberon
lets out the most awful screeching; red hot iron slides up between his
buttocks, then sinks up into his rectum.�
He tries to arch himself away from it, but Kelley simply pushes upwards,
driving the iron further up inside him.�
Steam and smoke billow out from between his legs, and he lurches and
thrashes about, his eyes bulging, screaming and screaming.

����������� Daffy screams too, as Zell now attacks her with the
breast-ripper.� The crowd is loving the
show, cheering with every touch of iron, taunting and calling for more.� Allielle is hanging spread-eagled and wet
with sweat, limp and exhausted, her body covered in angry burns and welts.� As Kelley draws the iron from Oberon's ass,
his screams linger, but he, too, is quickly sinking into shock.� As Zell sets about searing Daffy's remaining
breast with the ripper, her squeaks and squeals of agony echo across the
amphitheatre.

����������� I watch from the scaffold.� There is a beautiful kind of justice, in the
fact that Oberon is now suffering in the amphitheatre he built.� His intentions were entertainment; he wanted
to lure more people to come and watch as witches - and innocents like, he
didn't care - were tortured and burned.�
And never has there been a bigger, or more entertained crowd, than
today.

����������� As Zell tosses the smoking breast-ripper back into the
brazier, the three hang, panting and weak from their tortures, on the three
crosses.

����������� It has been about forty minutes, now, since the tortures
began.� To the three, it must seem to
have gone forever, a nightmare from which there is no escape.� And it is not about to end yet.

����������� I should be feeling pity for Oberon, now, as I am
beginning to feel for Allielle and Daffy.�
But this man has not only gained his pleasures from others'
suffering.� Even imprisoned, he has
continued to hurl abuse and taunts at me and the other loyal Witchseekers, to
threaten and bully as best he can.� In
truth I would happily go down there and join in his torture, but my place is to
watch over proceedings and make sure that all goes according to plan.

����������� Austin has a black scarf.�
Kelley has a small iron pan with several implements inside.� Together they go to Oberon, who is still
half-senseless from his previous torture.�
Kelley crouches in front of Oberon, between his outspread legs.� Austin, standing behind the St Andrews Cross,
slips the scarf around Oberon's neck, and begins to twist it tight.

����������� Immediately there are calls of alarm from the crowd; some
people think that Austin is killing the disgraced Witchseeker.� Oberon begins to choke; it returns him to
full lucidity in an instant, only for his eyes to bulge, his mouth to open, and
his muscles to tighten and tense as he begins a futile struggle against the
strangling scarf around his neck.� In
inevitable reflex, more reliable than Viagara, Oberon's cock begins to stir and
swell.� Angel lust, it is called;
the erection that arrives on men as they near death by strangulation.

����������� The crowd loves it.�
They are cheering and whistling, and I find myself laughing at Oberon
too, delighted at his humiliation, so helpless to his torturers that they can
even give him a hard-on, simply to torture it.�


����������� Oberon's cock stands up out of its nest of hair, and
Kelley is quick to wrap a thin cord around its base, cinching it tight as
Oberon continues to strangle.� With his
erection now trapped, Kelley signals Austin to remove the scarf.� Oberon, allowed to breathe again, gives
ragged gasps as he draws air desperately.

����������� From her pan of tools, Kelley produces a foot of barbed
wire.� She begins to wrap it around his
cock, starting at the base, as if putting tinsel on a Christmas tree: but she
carefully presses the barbs so that their spikes sink in to Oberon's turgid
flesh.� Oberon yelps and screams.

����������� Around and around his penis,� the barbed wire is twisted and pressed, a
gruesome adornment.� Little trickles of
blood run down his erection.� The men in
the watching crowd wince and squirm as Kelley's progress nears the sensitive
head of Oberon's cock; when the little spikes are pushed into the purplish
glans, Oberon jolts and screams on the cross.�
But he is helpless, and Kelley is in no hurry as she completes her
decoration.

����������� The next instrument she produces is a small, flat-barred
vice. 

����������� &quot;No, oh, please, no!&quot; Oberon moans as he
realises what lies in store for him.� He
tries to move his hips as Kelley goes to place the crusher over his
testicles.� She giggles in delight, and
plays the game, letting him jiggle his scrotum about, chasing it with the
crusher, until eventually she gets impatient, grabs his balls in her fist and
squeezes hard.� Oberon yelps and tries to
pull away, but Kelley pushes them between the rough-faced plates of the vice,
and gives the screw a quick couple of turns.�
Then she lets go.

����������� The crusher hangs onto Oberon's balls, completing the
Christmas tree image, and the crowd laughs and jeers as Oberon tries miserably
to shake it free.� Even I have to chuckle
at the sight.� Soon enough, Kelley
catches it again, gives the screw another twist, then another.� Slowly, Oberon's testicles are compressed
between the plates of the vice.� Little
by little, Kelley keeps turning the screw.�
Even when Oberon starts to scream with the pain, his balls horribly
pressed, she keeps going.� He will have
no further use for them anyway.

����������� Kelley tightens the crusher on Oberon's balls until there
is an audible pop! from one testicle or the other, and Oberon's howl
sounds barely human.� She takes that as
her signal to stop, and return to join Zell and Austin, both of whom are
looking slightly pale.

����������� Oberon, his cock braided with barbed wire, his balls
squeezed to half-inch-thick patties inside the crusher, gurgles up a short
spurt of vomit over himself.� His face is
almost green, his body running with cold sweat.

����������� I step back to the microphone.� &quot;I now call on those whose loved ones
were lost, to find their retribution upon the flesh of the condemned.&quot;

����������� Another cheer from the crowd; and now, the first two rows
of the amphitheatre rise to their feet, and begin to form three queues.� Finding these people, these boyfriends,
husbands, mothers, sisters and brothers, was not easy.� In many cases, Oberon had not recorded the
names of the women he kidnapped.� It was
only by investigating missing-persons reports and eyewitness accounts that we
managed to track most of them down.

����������� For Daffy and Allielle, the queues are short; perhaps a
dozen people to each witch.� But for
Oberon, the queue is perhaps fifty people long.�
The rules are simple; they may use any of the implements laid out upon
the table, or any of those heating in the brazier, for no more than ten
seconds' duration.� They may not attack
the prisoner's face.� And, in the case of
Oberon, they may not tighten, nor remove, the ball-crusher.� This, a small measure to protect him.

����������� The first of the relatives are allowed to go
forward.� Allielle's tormentor picks up a
whip; Daffy's selects an iron from the brazier; Oberon's takes up pliers.� Seconds later, there begins a chorus of
screaming and wailing and pleading.

����������� The lash lays into Allielle's flesh, striking across her
wounded breasts, her belly and ribcage; the hot iron sears the inside of
Daffy's thigh as she bucks helplessly screaming on the frame; the pliers crush
and twist Oberon's nipple as he shrieks in pain.

����������� The next three come forward.� This time the pliers munch and mash
Allielle's poor nipples, while Oberon feels the red hot iron against his
ribcage, and Daffy's tormentor takes a wooden mallet and smashes her ankle bone
with deft blows.

����������� The next three have their turn.� Allielle is branded.� Oberon feels the impact of a dozen
mallet-blows to his already-compressed testicles.� Daffy has a toenail torn out.� 

����������� And so it goes on as each of the bereaved and betrayed
kin have their vengeance on the helpless, spreadeagled bodies of the three, to
the cheers and encouragement of the crowd.�
Some use simple methods; slaps, punches, blows with mallets or whips;
toes and ankles and ribs are broken, toes are dislocated and the nails torn
out, skin is torn in strips or burned with irons.� Trails of blood run from between the legs of
the two women; despite the savage kiss of the iron, there was still flesh to
tear and maim.� Daffy has been branded in
her navel, on her breasts, on her feet and in her armpits.� Allielle's proud breasts have borne the brunt
of her assailants' anger, nipples and flesh reduced to tattered and bloody
ribbons.

����������� But Oberon is the most cruelly punished.� The whips and pliers and mallets have slashed
and torn and hammered at his wire-braided, bizarrely-erect cock and
half-crushed balls, red hot irons have scorched and seared his flesh, his feet
and toes are broken, his shins are fractured and already swelling
grotesquely.� His ribs are cracked.� His nipples have been burned and twisted and
wrenched completely off, and his body is painted in his own blood.� It is a gruesome sight, and I would feel
disturbed, if not for the knowledge that Oberon deserves nothing less than
this.

����������� When the last shrieking mother has been dragged away from
Oberon, still scratching the air with her fingernails and roaring in her grief,
Zell looks up to the scaffold, from where I watch.� In a single motion, he beckons me.

����������� &quot;Come on, Mistress Kirsten!� Your turn!&quot;

����������� I quickly shake my head.�
But Kelley, then Austin and Steve join in.� There are even calls from some in the
crowd.� I begin to realise that they are
right.� Oberon betrayed and deceived me
as much as anyone else here; and his unceasing taunts and provocations from his
cell over the last weeks have frayed my nerves.

����������� There is a cheer as I descend from the scaffold.� I go to the brazier, and draw out the same
iron that had been shoved up the depraved one's ass.� It glows with radiant heat, shimmering in the
afternoon air, and I briefly open my mouth and waggle my tongue at Zell.� He acknowledges with a nod.

����������� Oberon, hanging barely conscious off the X-frame, simply
groans as Austin and Zell together lift his head and prise his mouth open.� But his eyes flicker open soon after, as he
feels the radiated heat of the branding iron on his face.

����������� I stand before him, looking straight into his eyes.� &quot;This is for all of your fucking taunts
and abuse, you goddamn monster!&quot;�
Standing on tiptoes, I thrust the iron into his mouth.� Oberon's eyes bug wide as the metal lies
along his tongue, pressing it down, and a sound like cooking hamburgers is
followed, a moment later, by a hideous, hollow scream of agony.� His body arches and strains helplessly as
steam billows out of his mouth, his head shuddering with his efforts to shake
loose of Zell and Austin.

����������� I brand him for ten long seconds.� When at last I withdraw the iron, it seems to
bring a good portion of his tongue with it, smoking remnants.� Oberon falls into a faint.

����������� &quot;Clean them off , and prepare them for
burning,&quot; I say.

����������� Pails of cold water sluice the blood and sweat from the
three where they hang, and rouse them from their senseless state.� Allielle acknowledges her nightmare reality
with a long wail of horror; Daffy and Oberon remain silent, although Daffy's
face is filled with anguish and misery.

����������� Their shackles are opened, and the three are dragged to
the stakes; none of them can walk any more.�
They are held with their backs to the rough wooden posts, while their
arms are wrenched behind and their wrists are bound together with thick
rope.� Chains, then, are crossed over
their bodies, pinning them to the stakes.�
Allielle is pleading again, begging to be killed before the flames reach
her.� Daffy sobs quietly, her eyes
returning again and again to the sky; but whether she searches for solace or
rescue, I can't tell.

Only Oberon seems
impassive, unresisting as he is secured to the stake, still with the barbed
wire embedded in his still-erect cock, his swollen balls bulging from either
side of the crusher like squashed water-balloons.� From the way his head rolls and his eyes
wander across the restless crowd, I suspect the truth is that he is so dazed
and in such deep shock from his torture that he won't properly wake up until he
smells the smoke.

They are secured.

On my return to the
scaffold, I take a moment to reflect on how far I have come.� Making my timid entry to the Witchseekers
group, more than four months ago now.�
Oberon's welcome to me had also been a warning, suspicion in his
tone.� It was Tina deDance, ironically
hanged just a week ago, who had reassured him, and I had soon found myself the
group's Dungeon Mistress, interrogating many of the witches delivered to the
dungeons by Oberon.� Other women, it
seemed, were interrogated elsewhere, convicted with frightening speed - in some
cases, arrested in the evening and burned by the next morning.

At that time, as
far as I knew, Allielle and Daffy were both dead, burned at the stake by
Oberon.� But soon, messages began to
appear from both witches.� If they
were still alive, who had been burned at the stake in their place?

As the weeks
passed, and I became more familiar with the procedures of the Witchseekers, I
began to grow suspicious of Oberon.� The
arrests and burnings continued, and yet I saw few of the accused ever enter the
dungeon.� Then, unexpectedly, Tina spoke
out against Oberon - accusing him of corruption, of abusing his power - and of
using his authority to sexually use vulnerable young women, then burn them for
his own pleasure.� I had been working for
a monster!

At first, I
ran.� Fear of what Oberon would do now
that the truth was out sent me fleeing for my life.� But then I realised that to do nothing was as
bad as supporting Oberon in his spree of torture, rape, and murder.� So, gaining the support of a few loyal
Witchseekers, I made my return - a coup of the Witchseekers group.� Oberon was thrown into the dungeon.� And, within days, Daffy and Allielle were
also captured.

In his final week,
Oberon finally snapped � claiming to be a witch, promising that he would return
to life after his execution, more powerful than ever.� Where criminals facing death often make peace
with God and seek forgiveness for their sins, Oberon turned to Satan in his
terror of being judged.� But everyone
here knows that fire will destroy his soul as surely as it does his flesh and
bones.

And it is about to
be done.

All three witches
have been tortured to within an inch of their lives, and are bound, fearful, to
stakes atop a pile of wood and straw that Steve, our foremost executioner, has
prepared.� I look down at them from the
scaffold; Allielle's shoulders are shaking as she sobs in dread.� Daffy is muttering to herself, her face still
skyward.� Oberon is looking straight
ahead, still with his macabre hard-on.�
It looks for all the world as if he is smiling.

Smiling?� Damn him!

I step to the
microphone.� &quot;People, the
punishments have been given.� I now order
that the three - Daffy, Allielle, and Oberon � a self-proclaimed witch also �
be burned alive at the stake.&quot;

A great cheer rises
up.� Kelley, Zell and Austin stand watch
with the assembled guards as Steve goes to the brazier and lights a tar-soaked
torch, and carries its fluttering flame back towards the woodpile.

&quot;Oh god,
please, take it away!&quot; Allielle shrieks.�
&quot;Don't do it, don't burn me, please!� Don�t burn me!&quot;� But her pleas are lost in the jeering of the
crowd, and Steve crouches to light the outlying straw of the pile, right in
front of Allielle's terrified eyes.� He
progresses around the edges of the great pyre, but Allielle, and the crowd, can
focus only on the small flames that flap and curl where the torch first
lit.� Smoke curls and eddies on the
gentle wind, and the fire quickly spreads.

Allielle's screams,
her wide eyes and hugely dilated pupils, are telltale signs that she is truly
in panic; and as the fire leaps up towards her, she begins to struggle.� Deep in her DNA is a trigger that says all
or nothing; the fight-or-flight reflex that wants survival at almost any
cost.� She thrashes about with every last
reserve of strength.� Her body writhes
against the stake; her muscles strain until a sheen of sweat glistens on her bare
skin.� Her hands tug and twist and jerk
on the ropes.� Her teeth are bared in the
effort.

But a simple knot
about her wrists and a crossed chain over her torso is enough to hold her in
place, and as Steve completes his circuit of the bonfire, and flames spring up
all around the condemned three, Allielle remains held to the stake.� She cannot escape her death.� She can only scream.

Daffy, as if
infected by the sounds she hears, begins to struggle and wail also.� Her attention is finally drawn from the
heavens, and fixes instead on the growing hell that surrounds her, the flames'
corkscrewing demons reflected in her terrified eyes, and on the sweat that
polishes her naked body.� She, too, tries
to pull her wrists free of their bonds, to tug her arms from behind the stake,
but like Allielle, she is helpless.

To a chorus of
shrieking from the two witches, Oberon finally regains his senses.� He begins to moan as the first drifts of
smoke waft past him, sparks scurrying up as sap pops in the branches beyond his
bare and tortured toes.

The flames spread
and leap, and fire wraps itself around Allielle's leg with a crackling
sound.� She screams in agony as her skin
sears, fluids and oils boiling to the surface.�
The fire caresses her legs, flapping and licking like a desperate lover,
and Allielle shrieks out in her pain.�
The crowd loves it; their jeers and mock-imitations of Allielle's
screams echo back at her.

Daffy is next to
feel the first touch of fire.� She
screams horribly as flames flutter towards her skins, braising her skin and
turning it red, blisters quickly expanding and bursting at the searing touch.� She struggles desperately, screeching, but
the flames rally and return, tasting her for a second time.� The sweet smoke of burning witch twirls about
on the rising currents, and the smell quickly fills the air.

Flames have wrapped
themselves around Allielle's legs, and now force their way between her thighs,
lapping up into her most secret places.�
Even though hot irons have already seared away her flesh, there is still
agony in the fire's invasion, and she bucks her hips in obscene reaction to the
devouring flames.� 

Daffy is trying
desperately to lift her legs up out of the fire, but the flames jump up at her,
hungry for her, and the steam and smoke drifts up from her flesh.

Finally, the first
flames fold themselves around Oberon's feet.�
At last he begins to struggle; but it is far too little, far too
late.� His writhing only delights the
crowd as the fire clambers up towards his knees, tearing at his flesh.� He gives a scream, then another, joining the
shrieks of the two burning women beside him.

I hug myself
against the unsettling sensation of a pounding heart.� Somehow this seems too good to be true.� Oberon, the terrible, fearsome, all-powerful
Witchseeker General, finally giving voice to his agony as the fire eats into
his body.� 

Allielle's legs are
alight.� Now that the oils are burning,
she has become a human candle, and it is only a matter of time before she
succumbs to it.� Flames race up from
between her legs, eating whatever remained of her sweet sex, engulfing her
buttocks and twirling about in the small of her back, stripping away her skin
and searing her flesh.� She screams and
howls in horrendous agony.

Daffy is still
struggling, but fire has wrapped itself around her lower body, too, now; her
legs engulfed, her pubic bush completely gone and her iron-seared sex now
suffering the unbearable agony of fire.�
Her firm belly is blistering and reddening.

As Oberon shrieks,
I see his engorged and battered cock, still in its terrible cage of barbed
wire, begin to blister and steam.� Flames
lick at his agonised balls, too.� His
feet and lower legs are ablaze, his flesh charring.� I wonder how many times he watched witches
burning, never imagining that he would feel the harsh reality of that horrible
torment himself.

The heat builds,
the fire roars with a sound like distant thunder.� Allielle's body is surrounded in a twisting
tornado of fire that engulfs her, wraps its terrible fingers around and between
her tortured breasts, tears at her hands and arms and funnels fiercely up
between her shoulder blades.� Her red
hair erupts into flame and chars to her scalp.

Daffy throws her
head about as the fire claws its way up her body.� She is calling out, although I can't
distinguish her words from her screams as her small breasts blister and her
flesh drips in fiery droplets into the maelstrom of flame at her feet.� Her hair, too, turns to flame.

Oberon is bawling
like a baby.� Flames are tearing at his
flesh.� His cock is charring before the
crowd's astonished eyes, the barbed wire already beginning to glow red-hot.� The wispy hair on his chest smokes and then
singes, and flames skitter up the post behind him, blistering his shoulders and
neck as he thrashes and screams.

It is almost done.

Allielle, finally,
is a twisting shape engulfed in flame.�
Her breasts are melting, her face enfolded in fire, and even her screams
are lost in the roar of heat and fire.�
Daffy is almost fully wrapped in fire also, but still struggles dazedly,
even though her burns are already fatal.�
Oberon's legs and lower body are alight, and although he still thrashes
about, he too has already lost the fight.

As the crowd cheers
the demise of the three, I join the applause, exchanging smiles with Steve and
Austin, Zell, and Kelley.� The final
stage in purging the Witchseeker group of corruption and evil is complete.

Only a couple of
minutes later, Allielle's struggles have stopped completely.� She is now just a black shape encased in
fire.� Daffy is still moving, but no
longer screaming.� Flames wrap her entire
body too; they have torn away her hair and her face, and she has only minutes
left to live.� The lone voice now belongs
to Oberon, ever-weakening screams as the fire takes hold of him.� I smile, knowing that he gets to hear - and
feel - the bones of his own feet splitting and cracking as the fire reduces
them to blackened claws.

His screams become
a death-rattle that seems to merge into the crackle and whine of the fire, the
singing of sap and the hissing of burning bodies.� As the flames surge up in a spiralling
whirlwind around Oberon's entire body, he finally slumps.� Now, the three are joined by fire, great
twisting spires of flame jumping higher than the stakes themselves, chasing the
rolling, oily clouds of burning flesh into the sky.

The crowd is
cheering.� The guards and Witchseekers
are hugging each other and shaking hands.�
And I smile to myself, happy with my victory over Oberon.� His death is a joy beyond words to me, and I
whoop in delight, dancing a little victory-dance before scrambling down from
the scaffold to join my fellows in their celebrations.

The bodies will
burn long and bright, but Steve will continue to feed the fire until even the
bones are in shattered fragments.

&nbsp;













Part 9 - Mele

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first thing I wonder about Mele Sasagi is her lineage.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I chastise myself at once for the speculation.&nbsp; It isn't important.&nbsp; So she has brown skin; a witch is a witch, and the evil of witchcraft can be found anywhere on Earth.&nbsp; She may be African American, Native American, Indian, Asian; hers is a generic-exotic beauty.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She is in her mid twenties.&nbsp; A petite girl, barely five-foot-two, with black ringleted hair, large, dark eyes, striking bold eyebrows, high cheekbones and a flash of pure-white teeth whenever she speaks.&nbsp; Small-breasted and slender, but with a soft feminine shape to her naked limbs, she has, of course, attracted the interest of the guards; but they have all been warned of the consequences of&nbsp; inappropriate behaviour.&nbsp; Witches are dangerous, and wield sex as a powerful weapon against men.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mele's wrists are manacled together behind her back with iron when she is brought in to the torture chamber, her eyes wide with fear.&nbsp; Conventional wisdom is that a witch, when secured in iron, cannot cast a spell.&nbsp; Certainly in my experience, no manacled witch has ever been able to work magic and free herself.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She is surrounded by four guards, grim-faced and armoured.&nbsp; A fifth man, a scribe, holds his clipboard and pen, briefed to carefully not every word spoken, every action taken.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mele is obviously very aware of her predicament.&nbsp; Her almost-black eyes fill with tears as she looks around the torture chamber.&nbsp; It is made to instil fear, of course; interior designers planned every impenetrable shadow, every ghastly stain, every slimy trickle of water down the musty stone walls.&nbsp; The torches that flutter and flap in their high iron brackets are placed so that they barely illuminate the machines of persuasion, making them appear all the more gruesome and formidable.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fear is seldom enough to extract the Truth from a witch, however.&nbsp; All are aware of the consequences of being revealed, and a witch will always lie to save herself, until pain strips away any interest in self-preservation and she is compelled to give the evidence that will convict her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That doesn't mean that I shouldn't give her a chance.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Welcome, Mele," I say simply, after she has stood for a time, wide-eyed and uncertain.&nbsp; I pronounce her name melleh, which I understand to be the correct way of shortening her full name, Meleana.&nbsp; She doesn't seem to appreciate it, looking at me with an expression close to panic.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Please, how long have I been in here?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Does it matter?" is my response. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I want to go home."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That won't be possible."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her lip begins to tremble.&nbsp; "Never?" 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Never," I say.&nbsp; "This is your new home.&nbsp; As unpleasant as it is."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But � what did I do?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Mele, you know what you 'did.'&nbsp; You are a witch."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"A witch?&nbsp; No!!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Prepare her for inspection," I say.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Manacles dangle on a long chain operated by a winch in an open space of the chamber.&nbsp; Mele is taken over to them; on sight, she begins to struggle and protest.&nbsp; "What are you going to do?&nbsp; You can't do this!!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But she is held firmly and her wrists are uncuffed from behind her back, only to be fixed, instead, in the cold, heavy iron of the dangling manacles.&nbsp; With her wrists locked in them, she can only regard her own floppy hands glumly as one guard goes to the winch that will wind in the chain.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mele's arms are slowly drawn over her head.&nbsp; As they are drawn straight, her body extends to accommodate; her breasts and ribcage rise, her back stretches out.&nbsp; Her heels lift off the floor, until she is standing on tiptoes, much of her weight supported by her manacled wrists.&nbsp; Between her upstretched arms, her face shows the discomfort and humiliation.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That is far enough," I say.&nbsp; Any higher and she will be hanging by&nbsp; her wrists.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Next, the spreader-bar.&nbsp; A necessary tool in the inspection.&nbsp; It is an iron bar, three feet long, with a shackle at either end.&nbsp; The guards draw Mele's slender legs apart - for such a small woman, it is an uncomfortable spread, and she has to stretch her feet to get her toes on the stone floor.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The inspection of a witch is a task which must be taken seriously indeed.&nbsp; Too often I have seen men in this role simply start pawing at a woman's breasts or probing between her legs in an uncoordinated mauling that has nothing to do with inspection and everything to do with getting a good grope.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My approach is methodical, slow.&nbsp; I begin with her upstretched arms, trailing my fingers down as an aid to the visual inspection, stopping at any slight blemish or mole, and determining that it is not a mark of Satan, before continuing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mele has been imprisoned for several weeks, denied clothing or any means of personal grooming.&nbsp; A dark fuzz has grown in her armpits, which must be a dire humiliation to a woman as image-conscious as&nbsp; she is.&nbsp; No matter; chained as she is, she can't lower her arms and hide it, and I brush my fingers over the soft fur as my inspection continues; but there are no marks.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mele's breasts, although small, carry some weight, and on her raised ribcage have a fetching teardrop shape.&nbsp; Her aureole are broad, milk-chocolate circles peaked by fat brown nipples that have hardened in the dungeon's chill.&nbsp; My inspection of each breast is gentle, careful, missing nothing.&nbsp; Then down her belly, soft but flat, to the gentle flare of her hips, the soft black pelt of her pubic hair.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With her legs held widely apart by the spreader-bar, it is easy to inspect her; I kneel in front of her and briefly run my fingertips down the taut flesh of each inner thigh, then touch the softness of her brown vulva.&nbsp; She actually gives a moan, and I look up in surprise; her eyes are closed, though whether it is in arousal or humiliation, I cannot tell.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her sex is unblemished, and I continue down the taut lines of her legs, to her petite, pink-soled feet.&nbsp; There, just above her left ankle, is a small mark, which I note to the scribe.&nbsp; It seems random in shape, but witch-marks can take on many guises.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I stand, and this time inspect her back; lifting her woolly black hair aside and baring the nape of her neck, then following the ridges of her spine downwards.&nbsp; There is a small mole just beside her left shoulder blade, and I note it carefully.&nbsp; Mele's lower back follows a graceful arch to the swell of her tight brown buttocks.&nbsp; Kneeling behind her, I inspect between, assessing the tight little star of her anus.&nbsp; With legs held open by the spreader-bar, she cannot avoid my inspection; but there is nothing further to warrant suspicion.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are further matters we need to discuss, though.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Bring her down," I order.&nbsp; "Return her to her cell, until I have decided how we should proceed with the investigation."
Mele's relief, knowing that she is not to be tortured, comes in an outburst of tears as she is taken from the chamber.


Mele Part 2

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps Mele Sasagi expected to be questioned while under torture; but there are alternatives.&nbsp; Following accusations that my methods of inquisition are unsound, I have called a session of the Moral Court, so that the evidence might be presented openly and fairly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The courtroom in the Chateau is grand, its walls and furnishings made of timber, with an oval bench at which the Inquisitor may sit.&nbsp; For this occasion, I have pulled out a set of judicial robes from the wardrobe of the Witchseeker General, and, adorned in their black finery, I take my place at the bench, my notes ready.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Mele is brought in, she is stark naked again.&nbsp; Her arms are bound, but this time with rope, not iron.&nbsp; The ropes are passed about her upper arms and torso, and then, by more rope, her wrists are lashed high in the middle of her back.&nbsp; The effect is to fold her arms behind her, a most effective means of restraint.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are thirty or forty people in the court, observers as well as the court staff.&nbsp; Mele stands, shy and exposed, naked before them all.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Meleana Sasagi, you understand why you are here?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No, Ma'am," she says in a small voice.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I clear my throat and turn to my papers.&nbsp; "I have in front of me a report, made by an agent of the Witchseekers.&nbsp; I will not name her here, because it is in the interest of ongoing investigations that she remain unidentified.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"On August 29th this year, our Agent was at a nightclub known as 'The Beast Pit.'&nbsp; I understand you are familiar with it, also?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, Ma'am," Mele says.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"In fact, on the night in question, you were there, were you not?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mele thinks for a moment, then nods.&nbsp; "Yes, Ma'am."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What do you remember about that night?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Not much," Mele says.&nbsp; "Dancing � meeting people � just a normal night out."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Do you remember what you were wearing, that night?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"A � boob tube, I think, and a denim miniskirt.&nbsp; Low heels.&nbsp; Is that a crime?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I smile.&nbsp; "No, I'm sure you looked very fetching.&nbsp; Do you remember what you wore around your neck?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mele shakes her head.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Our Agent maintains that, on that night, she approached you and began a conversation.&nbsp; She complimented you on the item you wore and asked what it meant.&nbsp; Do you remember, now?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Realisation.&nbsp; Mele slowly nods.&nbsp; "Yes."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What was it you wore?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"A pendant.&nbsp; In the shape of a pentacle."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And what did you tell her it meant?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mele looks awkward.&nbsp; "I � told her it was an ancient pagan symbol."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Didn't you also tell her," I say, reading from my notes, "that it relates to Nature worship � but that it also represents the power of the female - of the Divine Goddess?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm not sure," Mele says.&nbsp; She is frightened, now.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Didn't you tell her, also, that it could be used as part of powerful magic spells?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I was drunk!" Mele bursts out.&nbsp; "I didn't know what I was saying!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Didn't you tell her that it could be used for spells?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes!&nbsp; Yes, I did!"&nbsp; Mele's eyes are wide with her growing fear, and she looks at the faces that surround her.&nbsp; Naked, bound, and vulnerable, she has nowhere to hide.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What did you say next, Mele?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I can't remember," Mele wails.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh, I think you can.&nbsp; I think you just don't want to admit it.&nbsp; You told our Agent that you are a Witch."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No!&nbsp; It's not true!" Mele shrieks at me.&nbsp; The tears begin to run down her cheeks.&nbsp; "I never said that, I didn't!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"We searched your apartment after you were brought here," I tell Mele.&nbsp; "We found a book describing Pagan rituals and spells.&nbsp; Do you know how it got there?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It's not mine!&nbsp; It belongs to a friend!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Which friend?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mele cannot answer, and shakes her head.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"We talked to&nbsp; your friends," I tell her.&nbsp; "And they all said the book was yours.&nbsp; If it belongs to someone we haven't questioned, tell us her name.&nbsp; Tell us, and you could go free."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I � I can't," Mele sobs.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Let me guess why.&nbsp; Because if you betray your witch friends, nobody will be able to rescue your spirit as you burn at the stake.&nbsp; And you will die.&nbsp; Am I right?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mele gives no reply.&nbsp; But that alone is enough to confirm her answer.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I shake my head.&nbsp; "Mele, the evidence here is sufficient for you to be burned as a witch.&nbsp; But if you cooperate with us, your journey might be made easier.&nbsp; Tell us the names of your sister witches.&nbsp; Tell us how we might find them."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mele sighs heavily, and looks at me, her dark eyes now showing plainly her despair.&nbsp; "No, I will&nbsp; not."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I give a not.&nbsp; "Very well."&nbsp; To her guards: "take her back to her cell, and in a few days I shall decide what to do next."


Mele Part 3
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It has been decided to question Mele further under public observation, in open court. This is an unprecedented move, but after being accused of unnecessary sadism in the torture chamber, I have decided that open scrutiny of my procedures should ease the public conscience.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The set-up is simple; a single, long chain passed over a high wooden beam in the ceiling of the court, ending in open shackles.&nbsp; Early morning, three hours before the proceedings are due to begin, Mele is brought in.&nbsp; Still naked, her hands manacled behind her, the witch shuffles fearfully towards the dangling chain, her eyes looking to me for answers.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But I say nothing to her, simply addressing the guards:&nbsp; "Secure her," I say.
"Please, what are you going to do to me?" Mele squeals.&nbsp; The guards unlock the iron manacles on her wrists, and at once she tries to pull her arms free; but they are grasped and held, and brought instead before her body.&nbsp; Her slim wrists are enclosed in the iron shackles, which are locked tightly, trapping her hands.
A second set of shackles, heavy black iron joined by just a single link of chain, are placed around her ankles, locking her feet together.&nbsp; This, to stop her kicking.&nbsp; Finally, I nod to two guards holding the free end of the chain, which dangles down from the wooden beam overhead.
"No!" Mele squeals
The guards haul on the chain; it clatters over the beam, and draws on Mele's wrists, lifting her arms.&nbsp; I can see from the tension of her muscles that she is trying to resist, but quickly her arms are pulled hard above her head, stretched up.&nbsp; Just as she had been during her examination, Mele is quickly made helpless.&nbsp; But this time, the guards haul again, and Mele's bare toes clear the flagstones of the courthouse floor.
"Uhh!!&nbsp; Let me down!!"&nbsp; Her voice sounds slightly strangled, her face compressed by the pressure of her arms on either side of it, her body elongated as she hangs.&nbsp; Though her ankles are shackled together, she lifts her knees, swinging her legs about like a mermaid's tail, desperate to find some kind of relief from the pain in her manacled wrists.&nbsp; But she cannot relieve it, and her legs drop to dangle freely again.&nbsp; The guards fasten the chain's free end to an iron ring in the floor, leaving Mele swinging.&nbsp; The chain creaks overhead.
"It hurts!" she complains.
"We will begin questioning at ten," I say, with a glance at my watch.&nbsp; 
Watched over by four guards, Mele is left to hang for two hours before the courtroom is opened to the public.&nbsp; For the first hour, she struggles and sobs, twisting her body about, tugging one foot and then the other against the ankle-shackles, as if trying to walk in mid-air.&nbsp; The definition of her arms' muscles tell of a battle to absorb her own weight.&nbsp; To relax is to transfer her weight to ligaments, a hot and savage pain.
But as the first hour passes and the second creeps, minute by minute, her strength wanes.&nbsp; Hanging by the wrists is as taxing as pulling weights in a gym, and soon, Mele is exhausted.&nbsp; Her muscles fail her, her head droops forward onto her chest, and she is left dangling like a carcass.&nbsp; The pain is obvious: a sheen of sweat glosses her dark skin, her defined ribcage shifts rapidly with shallow breath.
To Mele Sasagi, two hours must feel like a lifetime.&nbsp; But finally, the doors are opened, and the public are allowed in.&nbsp; I have already heard that some are critics of mine, and are determined to be horrified by what they see.&nbsp; Others come with an open mind, simply wanting to know how the process of questioning might unfold.&nbsp; And some, I know, are simply here to watch a young woman suffer.
Mele is a fetching candidate for that.&nbsp; Her deep-coffee skin, smooth and flawless, oiled with sweat; her petite and slender body limply dangling.&nbsp; Her deep-black, curly hair tumbling down her back, matched by the soft brushes of dark hair in her armpits, the tight thatch between her thighs.&nbsp; Her breasts, lifted by the strain of her suspension, but still slightly weighted on her ribcage, heavy at the base, while her dark nipples jut into the air.
The murmur of voices, the curious remarks and observations from the gallery, cause Mele to finally lift her head.&nbsp; I can only wonder how it must feel, to be the lone victim, hanging naked by her wrists, before an impassive audience.&nbsp; It is more than just humiliation and helplessness, it is a kind of social rejection that must fill her with shame and despair.
At least, that is the ideal.
Even after the seats are full and the crowd is growing impatient, I wait.
Despite her lack of noise or movement, Mele is in pain.&nbsp; The sheen of sweat over her body gets heavier, until it looks as if her brown skin has been smothered in coconut oil.&nbsp; Her black hair clings to her back.&nbsp; Every now and then, a fat droplet of perspiration slides down her ribcage from one armpit, or from beneath a breast, or drips from her down-turned face to splat on the floor below her dangling toes.&nbsp; Being hung by the wrists for hours on end brings pain similar to that of the rack; a deep and intense ache in shoulders and elbows, and a hot, fiery pain along the ligaments and tendons that is bone-deep and crippling.
This is the beginning of breaking her resistance.
When I finally make my entrance to the courtroom, Mele has been hanging for more than three hours.&nbsp; I have divested myself of the constricting judicial robes in favour of my favourite working outfit; my black silk baby-doll dress, shoestring shoulder-straps, backless but for a cris-crossing of slender straps, its hem flirting dangerously high on my bare thighs.&nbsp; Interrogation can be hot work.&nbsp; No jewellery, but simple slip-on shoes with one-inch heels.&nbsp; It pays to be well presented.
There is a gratifying response to my arrival: a burst of conversation, then silence as two guards enter behind me, pushing a trolley laden with implements.&nbsp; Its wheels rumble slowly on the stone floor.&nbsp; The gallery sees what is laid out on the gurney before Mele does, as its approach is from behind her, but she twitches her toes and shifts her head weakly in distress, knowing that her ordeal is close.
The gurney is parked to her left, and Mele casts fearful eyes towards it.&nbsp; It looks like the equipment array of a mad surgeon; all manner of clamps and pliers, corkscrews, pincers.&nbsp; Several whips and crops.&nbsp; A pear.&nbsp; Thumbscrews and toe-screws.&nbsp; And, on the bottom shelf, more than a hundred pounds of iron weights.
Mele gives a whimper.&nbsp; There is a reaction from the crowd; some giggle, some coo in sympathy, so I raise my hands for silence.
"Order, please.&nbsp; You are invited here today to witness a formal interrogation, which will be carried out in accordance with the standard rules and guidelines.&nbsp; Some of what you see may be disturbing to you.&nbsp; I remind you, however, that you are here simply to observe.&nbsp; Please maintain a respectful silence, and if you wish to leave, do so quickly and quietly."
I cast my eyes across the gallery.&nbsp; All eyes are fixed on me, and Mele dangling naked and shining beside me.&nbsp; I nod, and turn to the prisoner.
"Mele.&nbsp; Time to answer some questions."&nbsp; Even suspended, the petite woman's face is only a little higher than mine, and I put my fingers under her chin, lifting her head so that she is forced to look at me.&nbsp; "Just so that we are clear on this: I need to know the names of your sister witches.&nbsp; Because you have chosen not to tell me, I have to torture you until you give them.&nbsp; Do you understand?"
Her face framed by her upstretched arms, Mele's eyes fill with tears.&nbsp; She shifts her shackled feet weakly, setting herself swinging, a reminder of her helplessness.&nbsp; "I have nothing to say," she whispers.
I nod.&nbsp; "Very well.&nbsp; Torture, then."
Mele gives a sob, and the tears begin to roll down her cheeks, but she is hanging helpless and can only watch as I gather the first tools of interrogation.&nbsp; The nipple clamps comprise of small, serrated jaws that open and close with the turn of a screw; but turning the screw also thrusts a spike the size of a knitting-needle forward.&nbsp; As the jaws crush down on her nipple, so the spike will pierce its end and drive inwards.&nbsp; The damage, initially, is minimal, but the pain is most intense.&nbsp; Beneath each clamp dangles a small iron ring.
I do not explain this to Mele.&nbsp; She will learn it soon enough.
I cup my hand under her right breast and feel its weight.&nbsp; As I suspected from her breasts' teardrop shape, and the way they droop slightly on her chest, it is heavy and firm.&nbsp; With my thumb I brush the chocolate disk of her areola, and the brown nub of her nipple.&nbsp; In an involuntary response, her nipple stiffens a little.
Mele groans and clenches her teeth, tips her head back to look in despair at her own fettered wrists, by which she hangs.&nbsp; She cannot even control her body's response to my touch.&nbsp; My gentle nudges and tweaks of her nipple encourage it to grow, until it peaks her breast like a fat brown berry, half an inch erect.
I place the jaws of the clamp over Mele's nipple, and twist the screw.&nbsp; She gasps and jolts the moment the teeth begin to close on her nipple, but I turn it again quickly, and her nipple is already trapped.&nbsp; Mele twists from the manacles, reaching her toes for the floor and trying to tug her breast from my control, but I have her already.&nbsp; Another turn of the screw closes the clamp's jaws hard onto her nipple, and the end of its spike jabs into her sensitive flesh; the pain is obvious, and Mele sucks her lip, still twisting in the manacles.
"Names, Mele.&nbsp; Give me names," I say.&nbsp; Mele says nothing, so I turn the screw again.&nbsp; Her nipple is compressed and the spike drives deeper, its tip piercing crinkled brown skin.&nbsp; A tiny droplet of blood appears.&nbsp; Mele suppresses her shriek with a groan.&nbsp; The muscles of her arms and the tendons through her dark armpits are taut with her efforts to endure.
I do not expect her to break easily anyway; not if she believes her soul will be lost forever if she betrays her sisters.&nbsp; So I turn the clamp once, twice, three times.&nbsp; On the third turn, Mele gives a high-pitched shout of pain as the jaws mash down onto her tender nipple, and the spike impales it by a quarter inch.&nbsp; The pain is heavy and fierce, intense and focused, enough to bring new droplets of sweat over her helpless body.
"Oh - God, take it off!" she gasps.
"The names, Mele."
"I can't, I can't!"
I give the clamp one more turn, and Mele shrieks again.&nbsp; As I turn to the implement table for the second clamp, she gives a wail.&nbsp; "No-o-o!&nbsp; Please don't do it!"
But her left nipple is as defenceless as the right, and she jolts in panic as, with fingers and thumb, I caress it into full engorgement, so that it sits swollen and firm atop her quivering breast.&nbsp; The parted jaws of the clamp slide over her fattened nipple, their embrace gentle; but as I turn the screw and they crush down onto her nerve-rich flesh, the spike penetrating her nipple's core and sending pain deep into her breast, she squeals again.
"Oh God!&nbsp; Stop!&nbsp; Stop it!!"
"Give me the names of your sisters, Mele!" I demand.&nbsp; "Tell me now!"
"No!&nbsp; No!" Mele shrieks.
I twist the screw again, and the clamp crushes down.&nbsp; Mele screams, then stifles her shrieks, but sobs freely with the pain in her breast.&nbsp; Unlike a spring-closed clamp, the screw clamp can be closed with ever greater force.&nbsp; I can, if I choose, destroy her nipples completely, causing immense agony in the process.
But, for now, I choose to minimise the damage.&nbsp; Instead, I bend to the lower shelf of the gurney, and select out two melon-sized iron balls with hook attachments.&nbsp; Each weighs ten pounds, and Mele's dark eyes fly wide with horror.
"Oh please - no!!"
I look into her eyes, seeing the anguished look on her sweat-clustered face, as I hook the first weight over the iron ring of the clamp on her right nipple.&nbsp; "This is going to hurt a lot," I tell her simply.&nbsp; "Give me the names."
"Ohhh!!!"&nbsp; Mele pedals her feet desperately, casts her head back to stare up at her dough-lump hands, crunched hard into the manacles from which she hangs.&nbsp; I take that as a 'no' and let the weight drop.
It thuds into her ribcage and stretches her nipple down as if it was made of rubber.&nbsp; Mele gives a scream of pain, and renews her thrashing, but it only makes the weight swing, a heavy pendulum on her mashed nipple.&nbsp; The added drag on her breast draws it down her chest.
She is so lost in pain, she doesn't even notice as I hook the second weight to her left nipple clamp and let it swing.&nbsp; But its wrenching torture gets a response, a fresh scream, a scream whose pitch and timbre shows that the pain is beginning to wear her resistance down.&nbsp; It is only a matter of time.&nbsp; And application.
Mele swings about on her manacled wrists, squealing and sobbing, her breasts distended and drawn by the heavy iron balls that dangle off her stretched brown nipples.
"The names, Mele.&nbsp; Give me the names," I remind her.
She groans, her brow furrowed, her white teeth bared as she shifts her head back and forth endlessly between her up-wrenched arms, helpless in the clutches of such pain.&nbsp; No sign that she will betray her sisters yet.
I lift, from the trolley, heavy iron tongs.&nbsp; The jaws are slightly ridged for grip.&nbsp; They are simple, but brutal; their sole purpose is simply to squeeze and pinch soft flesh.&nbsp; I fix my eyes on a target that few in the court would consider a viable one for torture.
Framed by the arch of her raised ribcage, the heaving hollow of Mele's solar plexus is soft brown skin on a bed of firmer muscle.&nbsp; The sweat that runs on Mele's body follows the slight gully down its centre towards her navel, patterned by the nap of tiny hairs that make her skin like chocolate velvet.&nbsp; 
Mele is too distracted by the pain in her tortured nipples and breasts to express much dread as I step close to her.&nbsp; Bracing one hand against her sweaty back, I push the tongs into the resistance of her upper belly, then crushing them closed.&nbsp; A thick fold of her flesh is caught between the iron jaws, and as I squeeze, Mele gives a wail of pain.
"The names," I remind her.
"No, no, no," she breathes through her anguish.
I twist the tongs, corkscrewing her flesh, and Mele gives a long scream of pain.&nbsp; The agony penetrates deep into her abdomen, spreading like fire through her organs as an interconnecting sequence of nerves is shocked awake by the savage twisting.&nbsp; Mele kicks her feet, shrieking in pain as I turn the tongs in the opposite direction, her flesh twisting like toffee in the jaws of the tongs.&nbsp; Her dark eyes are a storm of agony and confusion at the pain that suddenly overwhelms her, and the tears spill down her cheeks.&nbsp; The heavy iron weights hanging off her stretched nipples knock against the tongs as I hold her flesh twisted, letting the heat and fire of the torture sear deep into her body.
Then, I release.&nbsp; Deep claw-marks are impressed upon the smooth skin of her solar plexus, but I don't give her a chance to recover; again I grapple the tongs onto her flesh, crushing, and then twisting hard.&nbsp; Another scream is driven from Mele's lungs as she feels the fiery tendrils reach deep into her body from the twisting action of the tongs.&nbsp; With her flesh screwed almost a full three-sixty degrees, I simply hold it, while the pain radiates through her like a terrible heat.&nbsp; Even her legs are shuddering, as if an electric current surges all the way down them, her toes fanned out as they swing back and forth above the flagstones.
Finally, Mele gives a whimper, and her head falls forward.&nbsp; She has fainted.
I loosen the tongs and replace them on the implement trolley with just a glance at the watching crowd.&nbsp; Some are surprised at Mele's intense reaction to the torture, but my techniques are well grounded.&nbsp; Mele hangs limply from the shackles.
I circle the unconscious witch slowly.&nbsp; The hair in her armpits is matted and wet.&nbsp; Perspiration runs in a slow rivulet down the gully of her spine, from the saturated curls of her black-wool mane of hair, to the cleft of her buttocks.&nbsp; I can smell her: the musky-tangy scent of naked skin and sweat and fear is a fragrance that no perfume could ever hope to capture.
Standing before her again, I slap Mele's face.&nbsp; It is a sharp, hard, open-handed blow that cracks through the courtroom, and Mele stirs her feet almost instantly.&nbsp; Then comes a long groan of agony, and her head lifts slowly.&nbsp; The nightmare of her interrogation floods back to her.
"Lift her feet," I order one of the guards.
He catches the iron shackles about Mele's ankles, and lifts her legs up behind her, so that her pink soles face the ceiling.&nbsp; She continues to mewl and weep in agony, and barely bothers to tug against his grasp, knowing now that she has no choice but to endure each torment as it is applied.
The device I gather from the implement trolley this time consists of two narrow, serrated iron bars brought together by a single threaded screw.&nbsp; It is a simple matter to pass the device over Mele's two big toes, just beyond the knuckles, and then twist the screw so that the bars clamp lightly down.&nbsp; Too late, Mele wriggles her toes and tries to tug her feet free, giving a wail of horror.
"Mele," I warn, and twist the screw again, "I want those names."&nbsp; Another twist; the little bars press with ever-more force on the flank of Mele's toe-knuckles, and despite the agony in her tortured nipples and the ache of her solar plexus, she twists from her manacles, quickly discovering a new level of discomfort.
I turn the handle.&nbsp; The toe-screw crunches down onto her toes.&nbsp; Mele yelps as a wall of pain hurtles up her legs.&nbsp; And that is just the beginning; another twist, and the little iron bars seem to be burying themselves into her brown toes, compressing flesh and tendon and bone.&nbsp; Mele shouts in renewed pain.
"Names!" I call, and even as Mele is shaking her head, sending fresh rivulets of sweat down her brown back, I turn the screw once again.&nbsp; She gives a new shriek of pain.&nbsp; Another twist, and I hear a creaking sound, as the iron presses with immense force on bone.&nbsp; The ends of her toes are rapidly turning purple.&nbsp; Her legs are shaking.
I have my fingers and thumb on the turnscrew, looking at Mele's bare glistening back, the corrugations of her ribs rapidly shifting as she pants in panic and pain.&nbsp; "Mele, give me a name, one name, and I won't turn it again."
Mele's only response is a high squeal of agony; but when I twist the screw, rewarded by the dull crack of her toe's knuckle fracturing, she instead screams with the full strength of her lungs.
I let her feet drop.&nbsp; Still crying out with the&nbsp; pain in her toes, Mele swings her feet forward, raising her knees towards her belly for a few seconds, as if she can somehow escape the pain ravaging her now-fractured toes.&nbsp; But slowly her legs drop again, and she sobs in her anguish, returning to a fully-limp hang.
I turn towards the gallery.&nbsp; I take a moment to scrutinise the many faces; some watch in awe, or perhaps distress.&nbsp; Others have a peculiar intensity.&nbsp; A few are smiling.&nbsp; The only sounds are Mele's sniffling and whimpering, the creak-creak of the chain by which she hangs.
I say, "Ladies and Gentlemen, you have witnessed the preparatory stage of interrogation.&nbsp; A subject with any degree of resistance is unlikely to break yet, but we have reached the stage at which she is quite overwhelmed by pain.&nbsp; She can no longer focus her thoughts, retreat into her inner sanctum, nor draw on reserves of hope or courage.&nbsp; She is growing weak, and any additional pain will quickly be beyond her threshold to endure.
"She will be left like this for another hour before the interrogation will resume, with a far greater intensity."


Mele Part 4

I sit at the Judge's bench and jot down my own notes, additional to those taken by the scribe and stenographer.&nbsp; In the gallery, people are moving from their seats, some choose to take a break, heading outside for fresh air or a cigarette.&nbsp; Others remain seated, watching Mele's endless suffering.&nbsp; It is certainly fascinating, the way her wounded nipples have extended and stretched to more than an inch in length, still firmly held in the little crushing-impaling jaws of the clamps, by the heavy weights that hang off them.&nbsp; Her breasts, too, dragged grotesquely downwards.&nbsp; As painful as it must be, none of what I have done to her will leave any lasting damage. 
An hour is time in which the pain in her breasts will mature and deepen.&nbsp; An hour is time in which the immediate fiery agony of crushed and skewered nipples will spread into an ache at the very roots of her breasts, where their tissue is anchored on a muscular base.&nbsp; An hour is time in which the pain of her thumbscrew-crushed toes becomes an unbearable ache as the surrounding tissue swells.&nbsp; From time to time, Mele shifts in her agony, the heavy iron shackles about her ankles clinking, her pain-filled face showing her unceasing battle to endure.&nbsp; An hour is time in which Mele's cerebral desire for self-preservation will be worn down by the constant agony, and all she will care about is escaping the nightmare of her torment.
After that hour, the crowd has returned to fill the gallery.&nbsp; Now, though, there are more; cellphone calls and text messages have summoned others, and as the people settle down, there is a flurry of camera-flashes that reflect off the mirror-shine of Mele's sweat-wet chocolate skin.&nbsp; I scan the expectant faces; seeing Zell, Austin, Kelley, and others.&nbsp; 
As I step out from the judge's bench, silence quickly falls.&nbsp; I keep my announcement simple.&nbsp; "Ladies and gentlemen, the interrogation will resume with the next stage."
I move without hurry to Mele, dangling limp and greasy by her wrists in the centre of the large hall.&nbsp; I put my hand to her chin and slowly lift her face.&nbsp; Her eyes are those of a woman already experiencing Hell, dark with suffering.&nbsp; Her fragrance has mellowed, sharpened somewhat; her fear is growing sour as the old sweat on her body is chased by new.
"Tell me the names of your sister witches, Mele," I urge.&nbsp; "And save yourself more suffering."
"Please," she whimpers, "I cannot!"
I take my hand away, and Mele's head droops forward again.&nbsp; A quick signal to the guards, and they go to the secured end of the chain from which she hangs, releasing it from the iron stay.&nbsp; The chain rattles over the beam above, and Mele's tortured body drops to the floor.&nbsp; Her screw-crushed toes touch first, and the agony brings a bark of pain from her, as her legs fold and she tumbles heavily, her shackled wrists slamming to the floor and the chain spilling across her body, the heavy iron weights clamped to her nipples all but cracking the flagstones with their impact.&nbsp; She lies, panting and whimpering with the agony in her bashed toes.
"Fix her hands behind her," I order.
A guard releases the manacle from one wrist, revealing flesh deeply-scored and grazed from five hours' hanging, and instead pulls Mele's arms behind her back, re-securing them.&nbsp; I signal the two guards at the free end of the chain to pull it in once more.
By the wrists, the brown girl's arms are drawn up, behind her, and she writhes in pain, suddenly scrabbling to get her knees under her, but hampered by her fettered ankles and crushed toes.&nbsp; She ends up in an awkward kneel, her arms extended up, her breasts stretched downwards by the weights that torment her skewered nipples, her head drooping forward, with her face veiled by the tumbling black mane of her hair.&nbsp; Her shoulder blades jut sharply with the awkwardness of her position.
I crouch alongside her, put my hand on the slick, burning skin of her bare arm.&nbsp; "Mele.&nbsp; Save yourself any more suffering.&nbsp; Tell me the names."
Mele slowly shakes her head, her hair sweeping on the floor.
"Raise her," I order.
The guards haul on the chain, and Mele's arms are wrenched high up behind her shoulders.&nbsp; She gives a shriek as her body is pulled up off the floor, the nipple-weights swinging, her tortured feet dragging forward; and, a moment later, she is hoisted up into the air, leaving a patch of sweat on the floor.&nbsp; Swinging on her back-wrenched arms, she bares her clenched teeth for a few seconds, but suddenly can bear no more, and lets out a wail of pain.&nbsp; 
Strappado is terrible indeed.&nbsp; The pain is huge and overwhelming; from the forearms and elbows, hot lines of fire seem to sear along the bones and deep into the joints, spreading like molten lead down the muscles of the back and sides.&nbsp; Mele is discovering an entirely new level of suffering.&nbsp; Although she is slightly doubled-over, her arms are almost straight up behind her, the muscles of her shoulders and triceps pulled into strong definition, as if she's pumped up after hours in the gym..
Her face, downwards, is dark with agony, and the sweat drips freely as she swings slowly back and forth in a wide ellipse, her toes now several feet above the floor.
"Ohhh � aaaahhhhh!!!"&nbsp; Her shriek echoes through the courtroom.&nbsp; The pain is so great that she can't even struggle or move about, but simply hangs, still swinging back and forth, the weights hanging off her nipples swaying,. making her breasts shift agonisingly with every small movement.
The sweat is dripping from her.&nbsp; She barks like a seal in her agony. The strappado has reduced her awareness to nothing more than this moment of time, this whirl of pain.
Standing before Mele, I look up into her eyes.&nbsp; "One name, Mele.&nbsp; One name, and I'll bring you down."
"I can't!" she erupts, the tears spilling freely.&nbsp; "I can't, I can't!&nbsp; He'll take my soul for ever!"
"Who � the Devil?&nbsp; You don't believe in that rubbish, do you?&nbsp; You can save yourself now � just tell me!"
"Ple-e-e-e-ase!" Mele bellows miserably, her mouth twisted in misery, mucus bubbling from her nose.&nbsp; She screams again in pain.&nbsp; I can sense restlessness in the gallery; people are disturbed by Mele's frantic wailing.&nbsp; 
She's close to breaking.&nbsp; The lead ingot I drag from the lower shelf of the gurney is the size of a brick, but weighs twenty pounds.&nbsp; It has an iron clasp at its end.&nbsp; Mele doesn't react to it, until I bring it towards the little device that clamps her fractured toes.&nbsp; Then, she begins to squeal in terror.
"No - no - no - no - no �"&nbsp; Over and over again.&nbsp; But I seize the screw in one hand, and Mele's words dissolve into a scream as her broken toes twist; I latch the weight to the screw, then let it drop.&nbsp; Creaking sounds come from Mele's wrenched shoulders as her body is stretched and torn in all the wrong ways, and she screams and shrieks in ear-shattering agony.&nbsp; Her head bucks up and down in mindless paroxysms, her fleecy black hair whipping about in a spray of wet.
"Talk, Mele!&nbsp; Talk, or it will rip your arms from your sockets!" I shout at her.
She can't talk.&nbsp; She can only scream.&nbsp; So I heft another weight to her; it is painfully heavy simply to lift it, God knows how she's going to endure it.&nbsp; With all the combined weights on toes and nipples, it'll be more than half her own bodyweight again.
As I kneel, grunting with the weight of the ingot, by her dangling feet, her eyes fly wide; staring down at me, her scream becomes a dread-filled crow-caw for mercy, but it's too late for that.&nbsp; I hook the weight to her mashed toes and let it drop.
Even in strappado, Mele's body visibly stretches with the extra weight.&nbsp; Her arms, wet and defined, are wrenched almost vertically behind her head, her body slowly twisting on the end of the chain.&nbsp; She is unable to move, paralysed by the hideous forces that strain her shoulders the wrong way.&nbsp; Any moment, we will hear the sudden, muffled crack of her joints dislocating, and her shoulders will pitch oddly.
Mele howls and screams in pain.
There is no hurry.&nbsp; I return to the bench, and sit, calmly writing down my account of the session's progress.&nbsp; All eyes are on the shrieking witch, her brown body grotesquely suspended and stretched, the weights hanging off her nipples and toes.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Twenty long minutes pass.&nbsp; Mele's screaming becomes high whimpers and shrieks, sobs and gasps.&nbsp; Every muscle in her naked young body looks stark and defined, her shining thighs and calves taut and rippling with the forty pounds that hangs off her toes.&nbsp; Her shoulders still haven't popped out of joint, and probably won't, without a little encouragement, so I finish my sentence, put down my pen, and step down to sashay slowly towards her again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Do you have those names for me yet, Mele?" I demand.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her response is a croak, a rope of drool hanging down from her open mouth.&nbsp; So I stoop to the implement trolley, and, puffing and grunting, drag out another twenty-pound lead weight.&nbsp; But as I bring it to her, I hear Mele's voice, thin and high pitched;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh God - no, no - please - kill me!&nbsp; Just kill me!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I'm not going to kill you, Mele.&nbsp; I'm going to add another weight, so that your shoulders burst out of their sockets and you discover a whole new meaning of suffering.&nbsp; I'm going to have you raised up, and then dropped, again and again, until -"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No-o-o-o!!&nbsp; I'll talk, oh God, I'll tell you anything, please, no more!"&nbsp; Her eyes are fixed in terror on the weight in my arms.&nbsp; The pain has finally broken her, it is beyond her endurance, she would rather be cast into the fires of Hell than endure another minute of this.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"A name.&nbsp; Give me a name," I say.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Brenae � Brenae Bailey � aahhhh!!&nbsp; � Brenae is a witch � I know it �!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Who else?&nbsp; Give me another."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Catherine Prynne!&nbsp; She is one, too!!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Who else?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No more!&nbsp; That is all!&nbsp; There are only the three of us!!&nbsp; Oh God, have pity, please, take me down, take me down now!!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Who else, Mele?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No others!&nbsp; That is all, I swear, I swear, ohhhh!!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"If I take you down, you will tell me, and the Court, details of these witches.&nbsp; Where to find them.&nbsp;&nbsp; What they have done.&nbsp; How you know them as witches."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes!&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; Aaahh - yes!!" Mele yelps.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She is broken.&nbsp; She betrays her sisters, and the way to destroying her witches' coven is laid open.&nbsp; I signal the guards.&nbsp; "Bring her down."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The clatter of the weights, then the softer tumbling of Mele's flesh as she lands on the floor, her arms falling behind her, the weights on her nipples cracking down against the flagstones.&nbsp; Mele's ribcage and belly heave as she sobs and wails, but the instruments of torture are removed one by one; the screw from her toes, the crushers from her nipples. She lies there, broken and wretched, stinking of sweat and fear and pain, just another condemned witch.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I face the gallery, once again.&nbsp; "Ladies and Gentlemen, you have witnessed the successful interrogation of a witch.&nbsp; Despite appearances, she has suffered little injury, and will be fit to burn at a time of our choosing."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mele wails in horror at that announcement, and bursts into a fresh flood of tears.&nbsp; But such must be the fate of a witch.&nbsp; I order the guards to provide a chair, and to chain Mele to it so that she may give us details of the witches she has given up under torture.


Mele Part 5 � The Burning

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mele Sasagi is definitely not prepared for her execution.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She is totally hysterical with fear as the execution party brings her out into the late-autumn daylight.&nbsp; The day is chill, too cold to be without clothes, but Mele is naked nonetheless, with wrists manacled behind her.&nbsp; Despite her two big toes being black and swollen from the mashing grip of the screws during interrogation, she scrabbles her bare feet on the gravel as she is half-dragged towards the open amphitheatre.&nbsp; She can see the sea of expectant faces, she can hear the almost carnival atmosphere; she can see the tall wooden stake, with the blackened manacles dangling on their chain.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; I don't want to die!" she screeches pitifully, the tears coursing down her face.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looks like a little brown animal, her body greasy and grubby after weeks without bathing, locked naked in dungeon cells, her black hair in crazy disarray.&nbsp; I heard that she hasn't slept since her interrogation, but has instead spent her time sobbing and calling out in her cell, living in dread of this day.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It has been a harrowing week for her; arrested, then put through the humiliating and intensely painful ordeal of questioning under torture in an open court.&nbsp; She gave the names of two other witches, one of whom has now been arrested.&nbsp; The other, still&nbsp; at large, has been offering hymns of salvation for Mele.&nbsp; It will be a relief when she is finally dead.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I watch from the scaffold, overlooking the stake and the woodpile, the eager crowd, as Mele Sasagi is dragged before them.&nbsp; A cheer rises up.&nbsp; I can see Mele begging them, a generic imploring plea for mercy.&nbsp; But she is a witch, and witches must burn.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The executioner Steve stands near the woodpile, tending the brazier.&nbsp; Zell and Austin are in the front row of the audience.&nbsp; I can't see Kelley; perhaps she didn't come, disappointed that Mele isn't to be tortured before her execution.&nbsp; I know there are others, too, who would have liked to see some extra agonies inflicted upon Mele's young flesh.&nbsp; But I see no need for it; burning alive is a horrible enough punishment.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh God, no-o-o!" Mele bawls, as they reach the stake.&nbsp; One guard clambers up onto the woodpile, and half-drags her up, as the others push.&nbsp; Pieces of straw and wood tumble under Mele's scrabbling feet, but soon she is forced with her back against the stake, and her wrist cuffs are unlocked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her bare arms are caught, and raised up.&nbsp; Mele squeals endlessly as her wrists are fastened, one at a time, in the manacles.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Don't do it!&nbsp; Don't do it!&nbsp; Oh God, please, please, please!" she shrieks.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The final touch is a rope about her ankles, looped then around the base of the stake,&nbsp; to stop her from lifting her feet out of the fire.&nbsp; Mele is secured, and the guards clamber down from the woodpile, leaving the naked witch twisting and howling, half-hanging from the manacles.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is no hurry to light the flames.&nbsp; Plenty in the crowd are craning to get a better view of Mele, snapping off photos.&nbsp; A sexy witch always attracts extra interest.&nbsp; Mele's petite, naked body is the colour of rich creamed coffee, skin smooth but for the dark fuzz in her armpits and the tightly-curled triangle between her thighs, the ringleted mane that tumbles around her face.&nbsp; Her breasts, small but weighty, rest on her lifted ribcage, their dark-chocolate nipples erect in the cold outside air, apparently no worse for wear after the tortures inflicted upon them.&nbsp; Her skin has the slight gloss of natural oils and old sweat.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She hangs against the stake as the long minutes pass, weeping in fear.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have seen many witches burn, and always I have wondered how those final terrible minutes before the fire is lit must feel.&nbsp; For some, perhaps, it is a daze, a kind of dream-like disbelief, which softens the reality.&nbsp; But Mele, I can see, is very much aware.&nbsp; I know she feels everything; the cold, hard grip of the iron about her wrists, the rough wood of the stake pressed between her shoulder blades and against her buttocks, the ache of her body's weight through her shoulders, the coarse bark and straw beneath the soles of her feet.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She feels, too, the chill air on her naked body; but I can see the glistening sweat in her armpits, a clue to the terror that churns inside her.&nbsp; That must be the worst sensation of all.&nbsp; Her heart will be at the base of her throat, pounding and thudding inside her ribcage; her belly will feel hollow, her bowels weak.&nbsp; Her legs will be trembling.&nbsp; It's just as well she is held up by her chained wrists, or she would probably collapse from the sheer weight of her dread.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I let the crowd admire and photograph Mele for quarter of an hour, giving her ample time to anticipate her coming torment, before unrolling the paper that I have prepared.&nbsp; I raise my hand for the crowd's attention, and silence slowly falls.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Witchseekers! Citizens!&nbsp; Ladies and Gentlemen!&nbsp; Although we are now rid of corruption from our group, there is still work to be done.&nbsp; There are still witches to be found and destroyed.&nbsp; The witch before you today, Meleana Sasagi, has been found guilty of wearing a pentacle, of creating spells, of owning books on magic, of associating with other witches, and of attempting to seduce innocent women into the ways of witchcraft.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"For these crimes, she has been sentenced to die.&nbsp; Let Meleana now be put to death by fire!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cheer rises up, met by Mele's frantic pleas for mercy.&nbsp; "It's a mistake!" she is shrieking out to anyone who will listen.&nbsp; "I'm sorry!&nbsp; I didn't mean to do it!&nbsp; Please don't burn me, I don't want to die!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She has suffered enough.&nbsp; I signal Steve to begin the fire that will reduce the young woman to ashes.&nbsp; He takes the torch from the brazier, and lays it in the straw at Mele's feet.&nbsp; Hanging from the manacles, she cries and cries, her teardrop-breasts jiggling, as little tentacles of smoke twist and curl up into the air from the newly-lit fire.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first flames are tiny, excited little creatures that jump and surge through the tinder, and draw screams of horror from Mele.&nbsp; She tries to draw herself up by her manacled wrists, her ankles working in the ropes that bind them, but she is held secure.&nbsp; She is forced simply to watch, to watch and wait, as the fire builds and grows.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Larger twigs begin to catch alight with a crackling sound, and tiny sparks drift up.&nbsp; I smell the sweet wood-smoke.&nbsp; Mele's body begins to take on that familiar shine of sweat as fear and panic grip her: she pees herself, an undignified stream trailing down the insides of her legs, and the wood of the stake.&nbsp; I can't imagine the powerful forces of terror that would drive someone to lose control in front of a crowd of onlookers.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The flames are sneaking underneath the stacked branches; I can see their bright flicker in the depths of the woodpile, and smoke weaves its way up, to curl about Mele's feet.&nbsp; She can surely feel its warmth, now, and she makes strange whooping sounds of fear.&nbsp; With her upstretched arms hugging her head, she can't properly see the fire's progress, but she knows it is building rapidly beneath her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Iam disturbed to&nbsp; find myself watching such abject suffering with a nonchalance approaching boredom.&nbsp; Far from the pounding heart and sweaty palms of my first execution, I am now quite relaxed, almost blas� about it.&nbsp; The shrieks and screams no longer horrify me.&nbsp; I fold my arms and watch as the fire advances slowly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Aaaah!!"&nbsp; A wave of heat touches her, and Mele tries to lift&nbsp; her feet up, but the rope about her ankles holds them in place.&nbsp; Less than a minute later, the first flames jump up between the branches and bite at her soles, gnawing at the ends of her toes.&nbsp; Mele jolts and arches and gives a terrible scream of pain, her flesh left weeping and blistered from the flames' scourging touch.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fire climbs around her, flames flutter and wrap themselves about her feet, encircling her heels and ankles, rope and flesh alike giving off smoke.&nbsp; Mele screams in the most terrible agony, unlike any torture, as her skin of her feet is split and flayed by the fire.&nbsp; Fire is licking between her toes, slithering up her glistening calves; I can hear a whooshing sound as the flames build in strength and speed, flying up through the wood around her in an orange blur, flinging up sparks that touch her naked, helpless body.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mele jolts and thrashes and struggles madly, shrieking and crying, as the heat intensifies the oily shine of her flesh, the flames mirrored in the polish of her brown skin.&nbsp; The first sweet tang of burning flesh reaches me, and I wrinkle my nose against its odour.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh Go-o-o-od!!&nbsp; Mercy!!&nbsp; Kill me, please!" Mele roars in her agony.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Flames bite and snap at her knees, eager to clamber up her thighs.&nbsp; Smoke is wisping up through the tight curls of her black pubic mat, and for all its thick abundance, it won't insulate her sex for long.&nbsp; Mele's fingers are fanned out above the shackles, helplessly reaching for some kind of escape.&nbsp; Her buttocks and thighs are beginning to blister, brown flesh turning crimson as the heat cooks her.&nbsp; Still she screams and howls and begs in her agony.
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The flames begin their slow ascent of her naked thighs, razor-hot tongues flickering up between them to set her pubic hair smouldering.&nbsp; As the savage heat torments her most intimate parts, she begins to shake and shudder in spasms borne from utter agony.&nbsp; Her screeches sound barely human.&nbsp; The redness is spreading up her heaving belly, steam curling from her ribcage and her bouncing breasts, the currents of heat stirring her woolly black hair.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fire is consuming her feet, turning them to blackened claws enveloped by flame, the bones splitting and marrow sizzling.&nbsp; Unable to support her weight, Mele hangs heavily in the shackles, twisting and wailing in her ongoing torment.&nbsp; She has her face turned towards the sky to avoid the blistering heat that now thunders all around her; while the lower parts of her body turn to tallow and ignite in lazy rolling flames.
Fire licks now between her legs, scourging the delicate flower of her sex, ripping away the fragile layers of tissue,&nbsp; flaying her flanks and cupping her wriggling buttocks in an agonising embrace, tearing her skin and melting the flesh beneath, as her body's fluids boil to the surface.&nbsp; The underside of Mele's plump, drooping breasts begin to sear and steam, and fire fills the hollow in the small of her back.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mele Sasagi keeps screaming as the whipping tongues of fire thunder up around her torso, fluttering now at her breasts.&nbsp; They redden, and seem to swell as the heat enfolds them; her nipples blacken and split and the sweat hisses away in clouds of steam that mix with the rising smoke of her burning body.&nbsp; Mele's head is flung back between her upstretched arms; the hair in her armpits finally singes away to a black stubble, as smoke drifts up and her arms begin to blister.&nbsp; Her black cascade of hair ignites, a huge whooshing fireball that whips about her face and delivers her into the final stages of her awful death.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her screams sill somehow ride above the roar of the fire, but when she next draws breath, flames fold into her mouth and sear her lungs, and the next sound that comes is a harsh croaking.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes, cast upwards, are fixed on the iron manacles that hold her in the midst of the flames, her own hands curled and trapped beyond them, the only part of her body now untouched by fire.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mele Sasagi is hanging from the shackles in the heart of a bonfire.&nbsp; The heat is such that I can feel it from twenty feet away.&nbsp; Her body twists and turns in its restraints, but it is only instinct that drives her to thrash about, as if she could somehow shake off the pain that screams through every inch of burning flesh.&nbsp; She is embraced and held by fire, it billows and flows around her body and throws oily rolls of black smoke into the air.&nbsp; Her breasts have burst, the fire hisses and roars and spits with the juices of her body as she burns.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Slowly, Mele's head falls forward between her upstretched arms, and her charred silhouette hangs, drooping and motionless, in the fire as the highest flames now leap beyond her clawed hands.&nbsp; Meleana Sasagi is dead.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another witch is burned at the stake, and the crowd is satisfied for a while.

Part 10 - Brenae

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I learn, half an hour before her first interrogation, that Brenae Bailey has been locked in a cell for more than a week with her wrists shackled behind her back.&nbsp; Apparently nobody thought to free her hands, so she has spent all of that&nbsp; time shuffling about the cell on her knees, naked,&nbsp; drinking her gruel from the bowl or gnawing at her bread like an animal.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By three guards, a scribe trailing them, Brenae is brought into the torture chamber, stumbling, with wrists still behind her.&nbsp; She is striking; her red hair tumbles in a thick cascade about her milky shoulders, all the way down to her cuffed wrists.&nbsp; She is statuesque, shapely, her breasts full and large and pendulous, their blusher-toned nipples like stones in the chill.&nbsp; Her belly is soft and feminine,&nbsp; her&nbsp; hips a broad and pale frame for the abundant copper-brown curls of her pubic bush.&nbsp; She stands slightly pigeon-toed, her toes curled on the damp, cold flagstones. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her eyes are cast down as she is brought before me.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have decided to try dressing a little more conservatively; a white sleeveless blouse and a fitted pinstripe skirt over knee-high stockings, nothing too sexy, although the skirt does have a side-split to mid thigh.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two-inch heels bring my eyes level with Brenae's.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As usual, I say nothing to her, but look the prisoner up and down slowly.&nbsp;&nbsp; I instruct the guards, "restrain her for inspection." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brenae is dragged over to where thick iron manacles hang on a long chain from the ceiling.&nbsp; Her wrists are freed from behind her, but the cold metal of the shackles is clamped about her wrists and locked.&nbsp; My assistant for this session is Zell; he stands at the winch, and on my signal, cranks the heavy wheel around, so that the chain is drawn slowly in.&nbsp; By her manacled wrists, Brenae's pale arms are slowly drawn higher and higher above her head, revealing&nbsp; the brushes of coppery hair in her armpits.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I watch as Brenae's body stretches out, her spine extending, her ribcage rising and belly growing hollow, until her bare heels leave the ground, and she is balancing on the balls of her feet.&nbsp; Half her weight is uncomfortably on her wrists and arms.&nbsp; She is breathing rapidly in fear, her heavy breasts shifting up and down.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Bring the bar," I say.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brenae gives a whimper, but still doesn't speak, as the spreader-bar is brought.&nbsp; The cuff of one end is clapped about her left ankle, and she is forced to awkwardly shuffle her feet further and further apart, until her right ankle is secured to the opposite end, her feet now a yard apart, only her toes touching the ground.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As a woman, I can understand how hideously exposed she will feel, unable to close her legs together.&nbsp; The very whisper of the cool dungeon air in her most intimate fleshy folds is like a ghostly taunt of what may yet be done to her. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Please �"&nbsp; She finally speaks, a strained whimper, her face red between her upstretched arms.&nbsp; I can tell that the restraint is uncomfortable, even painful.&nbsp; I simply catch her eye and shake my head.&nbsp; She will need to talk, but not yet.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I follow a practised routine of inspecting the witch, running my hands over her pale skin in a slow progress, starting with her arms.&nbsp; After several days of capture, I can smell the musk of old sweat from her underarms, although it's not unpleasant.&nbsp; I lightly lift each breast, checking beneath, then inspect her belly, before circling around to check her back, lifting her heavy mane of copper hair to check the nape of her neck.&nbsp; There is a dusting of faint freckles across her upper back, and I note their presence to the scribe.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I progress down Brenae's back, inspecting her buttocks, then peer between her parted thighs to the pinkish pucker of her anus, the puffy mound of her labia with its soft pelt of curly hair, and probe gently with my fingers.&nbsp; She moans in protest at my touch.&nbsp; Then an inspection of her taut thighs and lower sleek legs, her ankles and feet, before shifting around to the front again to complete my inspection.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Now � Brenae," I say, finally addressing the witch.&nbsp; "Did you have something to ask?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Please � are you going to hurt me?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That depends," I say, "on you.&nbsp; If you cooperate, you'll won't be harmed."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'll cooperate," Brenae says at once.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"All right �"&nbsp; I am suspicious, but I give her the benefit of the doubt.&nbsp; "You know, no doubt, that you were named as a witch by Mele Sasagi?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Meleana?"&nbsp; Brenae's eyes are wide.&nbsp; "She is a friend, that is all �!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"She says that you were involved in the Black Arts, that you and Catherine Prynne taught her such things as casting the tarot, reading horoscopes, and making spells?"&nbsp; Simply by watching Brenae, I can see the physiological response; tiny sequins of perspiration appear along her hairline, her eyes move rapidly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I � I'm not a witch," she says quickly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She knows that to be a witch is to burn at the stake.&nbsp; She believes, mistakenly, that if she denies it, she may save herself the agony.&nbsp; I signal Zell.&nbsp; "Raise her, we'll resume this later."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No!!" Brenae squeals.&nbsp; But Zell hauls the winch.&nbsp; The heavy iron shackles haul on Brenae's fisted hands, stretching her arms, stretching her body, and then, a moment later, her feet are lifted clear of the floor.&nbsp; She gives a groan, her head tipping back with the biting pain in her wrists.&nbsp; Zell continues to crank the winch, hoisting Brenae higher still, not stopping it until her out-spread feet are six inches above the flagstones.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'll give you a little time on your own, now, Brenae." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh no, please, it hurts!" Brenae gasps.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Of course it does," I reply.&nbsp; Being suspended by the wrists is torture.&nbsp; Of that there can be no doubt.&nbsp; Even in the first moments, Brenae is clenching her teeth and tensing every muscle in her arms and shoulders, fighting to endure the pain.&nbsp; With the spreader bar, she can only agitate her outspread legs slightly, twisting her hips washing-machine style.&nbsp; She shifts a few times trying to relieve the pressure in her wrists.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On my orders, Zell and the guards leave the torture chamber, although two are posted outside the only door, to make sure that nobody enters.&nbsp; Then I return to my quarters, switching on, instead, the live feed on my computer.&nbsp; I zoom in on Brenae's face, framed by her upstretched arms and those copper-bushed armpits, and idly watch her struggles.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The most urgent pain is that in her wrists.&nbsp; Iron manacles are a painful way to be suspended, pressing on the bones with the hundred-plus pounds of her body's weight.&nbsp; It will quickly become quite unbearable, and I can see it in the furrowing of Brenae's brow, the expression of pain on her pretty face.&nbsp; The droplets of sweat quickly appear on her skin, a shine on her arms; an inevitable response to such pain.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Please!&nbsp; Let me down!&nbsp; Aaagh!" 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My computer speakers faithfully transmit Brenae's plea, her voice strangely choked by the strain of her suspension.&nbsp; It has been ten minutes, and she is already begging for mercy.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Painful or not, she has no choice but to endure it.&nbsp; I minimise the live-feed window and get on with my work, completely forgetting about Brenae until another half hour has passed.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I view her again, she is in a lot more pain.&nbsp; I know that by now the ache of the manacles will feel like red-hot agony around her wrists, pain that will course down the length of her arms.&nbsp; It will be joined by the growing burning in her shoulders as her muscles begin to tire under the strain of hanging for so long, and the ache in her hips from having her legs so widely spread.&nbsp; Tears are coursing down her face, sweat streaks her body, and she hangs alone in the dungeon.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I minimise again and leave her for another hour-and-a-half.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The next time I view Brenae, she hangs heavily, shining-wet from head to toe, her head drooping forward.&nbsp; Her body is exhausted, her arms raging with pain from such a long suspension, her spine extended, her joints aching.&nbsp; Her hands, above the manacles, are blue claws.&nbsp; Her legs are still widely spread by the bar; cramps will have speared along her calves and through the muscles of her thighs, her hips will be burning..&nbsp; Two hours' hanging has been an ordeal beyond anything she has been through in her life; and yet it is nothing compared to what may be brought to bear on her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As much as I am loath to admit to myself, in the face of accusations that I am a sadist, I am fascinated by the way Brenae looks after she has hung for such a long time.&nbsp; The muscles of her arms and widespread legs are defined, her body looks long and lean, almost athletic.&nbsp; She almost looks in a state of calm, meditative relaxation; but I know there is a world of difference between that, and the overwhelming weakness and pain that she is actually feeling.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Breaking her is going to be so easy, I almost feel disappointed.&nbsp; A challenge, once in a while, would be nice.&nbsp; Just to be sure she will be ready to talk when I return, I call Zell and advise him that we'll leave Brenae for another six hours before returning to the torture chamber.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brenae is still hanging as we left her, when we return eight hours later.&nbsp; By now she has learned the true meaning of suffering.&nbsp; Her arms will be burning with a terrible ache that goes all the way to the bones, combined with a numbness in her hands and a burning in her wrists that will take days to fully disappear.&nbsp; The muscles of her arms and the ligaments of her joints have loosened and stretched, leaving her debilitated and weak.&nbsp; The ordeal of hanging has effectively drained her strength, and she is now as helpless as a baby.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I approach, flanked by four guards, Zell, and the scribe, Brenae gives no reaction.&nbsp; Her head rests on her chest, her eyes half-closed, unseeing.&nbsp; Tears and drool mix with the sweat on her face, streaking her shining breasts.&nbsp; Her legs are still held wide apart by the spreader-bar, and her hips must feel as if glass has been packed into the joints.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Brenae!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her lips move, and, slowly, Brenae's head lifts.&nbsp; Her eyes fight to focus.&nbsp; "It's time to talk," I say.&nbsp; I slowly circle her, flaunting my freedom, underlining her helplessness.&nbsp; Brenae groans and stirs, her ankle-cuffs rattling against the spreader-bar that holds her drooping feet wide.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I glance at Zell.&nbsp; "Bring her down."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The overhead chain clatters through the pulley.&nbsp; Brenae's outspread feet touch first, but her legs fold; she crashes to her parted knees, then flops forward onto her belly, her face smacking the flagstones, her arms slapping heavily down over her head.&nbsp; She groans, too weak to move, her body glistening and greasy, as the spreader-bar is unlocked from her ankles, the manacles taken from her wrists.&nbsp; They are deeply grooved and grazed from her long ordeal.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She begins to sob.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I crouch alongside her.&nbsp; "Tell me what magic you work, Witch.&nbsp; Tell me your incantations and spells.&nbsp; Tell me where your books of spells and magic are hidden?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Why do you accuse me so?" she weeps.&nbsp; "I am not a witch!&nbsp; Even if you make me say it, it would not be true!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Then why would Mele Sasagi say you were?" I demand.&nbsp; "And why would Catherine Prynne, of her own free will, not even under torture, have named you as a witch?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brenae whimpers.&nbsp; Fresh tears are starting to run down her cheeks.&nbsp; "I don't know! I don't even know who these people are!&nbsp; I don't know what they have against me!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Perhaps you just need reminding," I say.&nbsp; "You will tell me these things.&nbsp; You will tell me where Catherine Prynne is hiding.&nbsp; And you will tell me who is this 'Lord Master Darkness' to whom Catherine refers."&nbsp; I tell the guards, "bring her."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brenae's arms have no strength, and she can offer no resistance as she is grabbed and hauled to her feet by two guards.&nbsp; Now she is afraid.&nbsp; The tears won't stop.&nbsp; "Please!&nbsp; I don't know any of these things!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"We shall see."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You have no proof," she says.&nbsp; "What if I truly know nothing?&nbsp; Would you torture me until I die?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Where are your books and relics hidden, Brenae?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"There are no books and relics!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What other witches can you name?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"There are none!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Where is Catherine Prynne?"&nbsp; The witch Prynne has become the thorn in my side, even managing to escape despite being locked in shackles in a cell.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I don't know!&nbsp; I don't even know her!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And I suppose you don't know any Lord Master Darkness?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I swear, I don't know!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I sigh.&nbsp; "Fine.&nbsp; Put her on the rack."
I had hoped that hanging by her wrists would have been enough persuasion; but Brenae evidently needs more.&nbsp; The rack is a good choice: the very words, the rack, are enough to terrify her, and fear draws a horrified cry from Brenae's lungs as the guards drag her across the torture chamber.&nbsp; She tries, finally, to resist, struggling to get her half-paralysed legs under her, trying to move her clawed and grey fingers, but she has no strength.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Visually, the wheel rack lives up to its fearsome reputation.&nbsp; The diabolical machine looms dark and ominous in the shadows.&nbsp; Its cogs and ratchets oiled and waiting; its manacles lying open; the iron studs on its broad rim glinting in the half-light.&nbsp; It is a terrible device, as gothic and forbidding as any instrument of torture ever was.&nbsp;&nbsp; Brenae almost collapses when she sees it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh!&nbsp; Please, please, no!" she shrieks.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But she is pushed against the broad, studded rim, her wrists lifted to the shackles, which are closed and locked, snugly trapping her hands.&nbsp; The heavy ankle-fetters are locked in place, anchoring her feet to the unmoving base.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the gloom, I see the gleam of Zell's teeth, as, grinning, he cranks over the handle.&nbsp; The heavy wheel groans and turns, and by its slow, rolling motion, draws on Brenae's wrist chains.&nbsp; Gradually, her arms are pulled up and back, following the arch of the wheel, her body bowing slowly backwards.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Don't, please don't, oh don't do this," she is gibbering, struck through with terror.&nbsp; I can see from the tension in her muscles that she is trying to fight the turning, but there is no way her body can match the inexorable force of the machine.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On my instruction, guards bring implements; a wheeled trolley laid out with instruments of persuasion, a pail of water.&nbsp; Brenae looks but does not see, her mind filled with panic as her arms are pulled straight and her back arches.&nbsp; The iron studs dig into her tender flesh.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As her heels leave the ground, I hear the popopopop of her spine flexing.&nbsp; Her pleas unsuccessful, Brenae gives a shout of desperate panic.&nbsp; "You won't get away with this!&nbsp; One day your crimes against innocents will be paid back to you a thousand times over!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Don't be so na�ve, Brenae," I scold.&nbsp; The slowly-turning wheel creaks and moans like an old sailing ship, and the ankle chains grow taut.&nbsp; Brenae, her flushed face flanked by the hair-matted hollows of her armpits, her red hair splashed across the wood behind her head, gives a whimper as the tension begins to pull through her legs.&nbsp; In a strange irony of her situation, her breasts have never looked more beautiful,&nbsp; lifted by her raised ribcage, peaked by the pink buds of her nipples.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hold there," I instruct.&nbsp; Zell stops the slow turning, and the ratchet locks Brenae's taut body in place.&nbsp; The muscles of her legs are drawn tight, her belly is hollowed, her hip-bones form a stark frame for the untamed bush of her pubic hair.&nbsp; Her bare skin gleams in the orange light.&nbsp; She moans softly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I glance to a guard.&nbsp; "Wash her down."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The pail-full of icy-cold water is flung over Brenae.&nbsp; The icy impact shocks a scream from her lungs, tearing her back to lucidity.&nbsp; As water courses in rivulets down over her breasts, trickling down the ravine of her belly, quivering droplets covering her bare skin, goosebumps rise all over her naked body.&nbsp; Her nipples tighten and stiffen, pink stalks, the aureole darkening and crinkling in response to the cold.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The item I pick up is called a hose clip.&nbsp; A tiny steel hoop, quarter of an inch in diameter,&nbsp; its purpose to clamp around slender engine hoses.&nbsp; I need pliers to pinch the ends and expand the clip.&nbsp; It takes a matter of seconds to prepare the first clip, pass it over the thick, rubbery swell of Brenae's right nipple, and release the pliers' grip.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The hose clip cinches with terrible force around the base of Brenae's nipple, and she gives a howl of pain.&nbsp; It seems to sink into the turgid flesh, strangling her nipple at its base, leaving most of the nipple swollen and extended, an engorged and reddening&nbsp; teat.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Take it off!&nbsp; Take it off!" Brenae shrieks.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But already I am preparing the second clip, and before Brenae's watering and horrified eyes, I fit it over her left nipple and release.&nbsp; It closes hard and cruelly around the base of her nipple, and she gives another shriek.&nbsp; She cannot struggle, uncomfortably arched over the wheel rack, and has no way to ease the blazing pain of the clips.&nbsp; Her face again begins to break out in a sweat.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Now, give her five notches," I tell Zell.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The big wheel-rack creaks and shifts, and by her manacled wrists, Brenae is stretched an inch.&nbsp; I have endured the slow insistence of this machine myself, and I know that the spread of strain through the body is remarkably even, building equally through all the joints.&nbsp; I can see that Brenae's body is now uncomfortably tight, so that her muscles feel stressed.&nbsp; It is a vague discomfort compared to the searing bite of the clips on her nipples, but it will worsen.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Now we will leave her," I say.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Time left alone is time in which Brenae's pain matures and grows.&nbsp; In her limbs, it becomes a maddening combination of torments that will not ease, and her head rolls from side to side unceasingly as one hour drags into two.&nbsp; The ache of her already-drained muscles becomes an insistent, gnawing burn of fatigue, while, deeper in her shoulder, hip, elbow and knee joints, a hotter, fiercer pain gradually builds as the ligaments bear more and more of the strain.&nbsp; The fire in her strangled nipples deepens, too, growing until it feels like iron nails have been driven deep into the core of each breast.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To know my prisoner's suffering is to hold the key to breaking her, and as I watch Brenae's head shift, and see her gnaw her own lips in agitation and pain, I know that it is only a matter of time.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Two hours later it is time to begin Brenae's questioning.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Guards.&nbsp; Scribe.&nbsp; Zell.&nbsp; We make our return.&nbsp; My outfit is the black leather halter-dress that almost resembles a stylised apron, its skirt and bust fitting, but leaving my back and arms bare for unrestricted movement.&nbsp; And leather, of course, is easy to clean.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brenae's bowed-back body is still shining-wet, but with perspiration now.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Zell, give her two notches," I order.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The stretch is enough to send little shards of agony through Brenae's shoulders and hips.&nbsp; A reminder of what the rack can yet do to her.&nbsp; It also brings her back to full awareness, her D-cup breasts heaving.&nbsp; Still choked in the grip of the little hose-clips, her nipples have grown magenta in colour, a purplish hue beneath the painful redness, and are more swollen than ever.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Tell me where you have hidden tools of your magic," I demand.&nbsp; "Tell me the spells you use.&nbsp; Tell me the names of the other witches you associate with!&nbsp; Tell me where is Catherine Prynne?&nbsp; Tell me who is your Lord Master Darkness?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I have never practised magic," Brenae says weakly.&nbsp; "I know no witches.&nbsp; I do not know Catherine Prynne.&nbsp; I do not know this Lord Darkness.&nbsp; I am just a woman, I know nothing of these things!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The candle I select from the implement gurney is six inches tall, two inches across, with a thick and heavy wick.&nbsp; I place it where Brenae can see it, slowly picking up a matchbox, striking a single match, touching it to the wick.&nbsp; The flame catches, flutters, then builds into a tall, bright upside-down teardrop, its peak tapering to a reddish-orange, a slender thread of smoke sliding upwards into the cool air.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I will ask you again, Brenae," I say slowly.&nbsp; I lift the candle and hold it in front of her.&nbsp; Held taut and helpless on the wheel-rack, Brenae cannot even struggle, but can only gaze in horror at the bright point of light.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh shit � please," she whimpers.&nbsp; "I do not know answers."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is a shallow channel that runs from just beneath her breasts, down to her belly-button; pale skin beaded with perspiration, heaving with shallow breath.&nbsp; It is to this flinching skin that I first bring the candle flame, holding it close so that Brenae feels the bite of heat, her sweat turning to steam.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Uuhh!" she moans, trying to suck in her stomach.&nbsp; I bring the flame close again, just kissing her skin, and there is a soft hiss and Brenae again cries out.&nbsp; "Oh, fuck, fuck it hurts!&nbsp; Stop, please!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Talk, Witch.&nbsp; Talk or it gets worse for you!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I am not a witch!&nbsp; I don't know what you ask!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I touch her again with the candle, holding it longer to her flesh, burning slowly down the line of her solar plexus, and this time the skin crackles and reddens in the flame's savage path.&nbsp; Brenae gives a scream of pain, her head whips from side to side, and the sweet odour of burning sweat and skin fills my nostrils.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I ask again!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tears are spilling from Brenae's eyes.&nbsp; "Please, stop!" she begs.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The candle flame kisses her belly again, fleeting visits that burn her skin and draw shrieks from her lungs.&nbsp; The burns are only superficial, but they hurt badly enough to bring a fresh beading of sweat over her tightly-pulled body. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No!!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lower.&nbsp; Halfway down her stomach, tiny peach-fuzz hairs vaporising and skin searing under the candle's razor-touch.&nbsp; Brenae's body jolts within the unforgiving torsion of the rack, and again she shrieks in pain.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Jesus, that's sexy," I hear Zell mutter.&nbsp; At the handle of the rack, he is watching enthralled.&nbsp; I am annoyed by the intrusion, but focus my attention again, and touch the candle's flame to Brenae's defenceless belly again.&nbsp; She screams.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Ohhhh fu-u-uck!&nbsp; It hu-u-urts!&nbsp; Stop!&nbsp; Stop!!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A weeping trail of blisters and burns mark each place where the candle has licked her flesh; I touch it again barely above her navel, hissing sweat and crackling skin and another shriek from Brenae.&nbsp; She can smell her own burning flesh.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But this has only been an introduction to the candle's searing touch.&nbsp; Both Brenae and I know that it can get much, much worse.&nbsp; I regard her helplessly straining and arched body; the apex of the wheel-rack's curve is in the small of her back; her legs stretch down to the ankle-shackles, slightly parted, exposing the fragile geography of her genitalia in its soft nest of brown.&nbsp; She knows she is vulnerable, and it is fear as much as pain that continues to drive the sweat over her body.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I run my fingertips down over the corrugations of her ribcage, the taut skin of her belly, then flick them through the shallow dip of her navel.&nbsp; Brenae catches her breath, helpless in anticipation.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A moment later, I touch and hold the candle's flame to her belly button.&nbsp; It licks into the slight hollow with the sound of sizzling sweat, and Brenae gives a shriek, then another, then a cry of pain.&nbsp; I do not lift the candle away, but hold it in place, letting the flame flutter and burn, tearing at her sensitive skin, while wax drips to land in her pubic hair beneath.&nbsp; Brenae can do nothing but shriek and wail with the pain, as a long scorch-mark slowly forms above her burning navel. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The agony as her belly-button is burned must seem to bore all the way to her spine, and despite the tension of the rack, she tries to writhe her hips and escape the agony; but she is held firmly under the candle's searing touch, and as the pit of her navel reduces to black char, her screams are filled with horror and pain.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I finally withdraw the flame, Brenae's cry trails off into a long wail.&nbsp; She is running sweat, every muscle pumped from her fruitless struggles.&nbsp; Her breasts bounce on her chest with her rapid, panting breath.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm running out of patience, Brenae," I warn.&nbsp; "What magic have you used?&nbsp; Where do you keep your books and relics?&nbsp; What other witches are in your coven?&nbsp; Where has Catherine Prynne gone?&nbsp; Who is your Lord Master Darkness?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brenae is weeping.&nbsp; "I don't know any of that, I swear!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With one finger, I gently flick the swollen tip of Brenae's bloated and choked left nipple.&nbsp; Even that small contact is unbearable, and she gives a shriek.&nbsp; Realisation drains the colour from her face.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh shit, no, no no!"&nbsp; She sees the candle being brought close; she tries to lift her head from between her arms, desperately trying to blow out the flame; but the arch of her body and the tautness of the rack mean that she cannot get the angle nor the air to do it.&nbsp; She puffs uselessly a few times; I wait until she is done, then bring the flame underneath her nipple.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is quite magical, the way Brenae's nipple parts the flame.&nbsp; Two halves of a single flame wrap almost lovingly around her nipple, and there is a hissing, crackling.&nbsp; Then Brenae screams as the pain hits her, eyes bugging from her head and every muscle rigid.&nbsp; The pain bores deeply into her breast, and Brenae's head begins to whip from side to side in helpless agony, her thick mane of red hair shifting and sweeping about.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have lifted the candle flame away before anything more than superficial damage is done; but I burn her right nipple instead.&nbsp; Again the crackle of searing flesh, and again Brenae gives horrible shrieks of pain.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Left.&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; Left.&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; I shift the candle from one breast to the other, just letting the flame caress her swollen and now weeping nipples.&nbsp; Quickly they darken, the top layers of skin charring, then splitting to expose fresh, sensitive flesh beneath.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh please, oh please!!" Brenae shrieks.&nbsp; Tears course down her face.&nbsp; "Stop, stop, please stop!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Reveal what you know!" I shout&nbsp; "You are holding back from me!&nbsp; Talk, and it stops!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her mouth still open, her face screwed up in pain, Brenae wails in a whirl of confusion, but she is still not ready to condemn herself, nor others, to the fire.&nbsp; So I put the candle to her nipple once more, and burned flesh smokes again as the flame curls around it.&nbsp; Brenae shrieks and cries in agony.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Left nipple.&nbsp; Right nipple.&nbsp; Left, right; until the swollen nodes of flesh are charred and misshapen, and Brenae is arched and groaning on the curve of the rack.&nbsp; Both nipples are almost burned through; and yet Brenae has not yet been broken.&nbsp; Despite her low threshold to pain, she is holding out; but she has not achieved anything other than to prolong her own nightmare.&nbsp; She knows it, and I can see that she is trying to convince herself that she can endure more.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Give her four notches," I tell Zell.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brenae's body is already tightly stretched, and as the wheel creaks and shifts, hot agony flashes through her limbs, brutal and tearing.&nbsp; Brenae gives a high-pitched wail.
Another notch, forcing her joints to accommodate; intense pain beds at the base of her spine, flares through the muscles of her belly.
Another notch, and deep popping sounds come from between her vertebrae, dragging another wail from her lungs.
With the final notch, Brenae gives a cry that she barely manages to contain again.&nbsp; Her world is becoming undiluted pain.&nbsp; Her limbs burn, her spine hurts badly, her burned belly-button and nipples torment her in slow, searing waves of agony.&nbsp; And I can make it still worse.
The candle is burning bright and steady as I bring it close to her face.&nbsp; Brenae whimpers, trying to turn away from its heat.&nbsp; Slowly, I trail it down her body, between her drooping and wounded breasts, over her arched ribcage, her taut and red-scorched belly.&nbsp; She moans as the flame passes her burned and seeping navel, singeing the slight spider-trail that heralds the spread of her pubic bush.&nbsp; 
And then I thrust the lit candle between her legs.
There is a little hiss as the flame begins to burn away the thicket of curly hairs that guard her secret flower.&nbsp; Pungent smoke curls up over her bushy pubic mound.&nbsp; Then comes the hissing of sweat as the heat reaches tender skin.&nbsp; An instant later, Brenae begins to wail, then shriek, then scream.&nbsp; Her eyes bulge.&nbsp; Her lungs empty themselves in a terrible screeching as I pass the flame back and forth, searing her hooded clitoris, her labia, holding it directly under the flinching star of her anus.&nbsp; The soft hairs that surround it smoulder and then burn away, the skin hisses, wisps of smoke curling from between her thighs, and Brenae shrieks and howls.
"Oh fuck no oh oh oh shit please stop aaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!"&nbsp; Her head thrashes from side to side, her hair across her face; she is squealing and roaring with pain as her delicate vulva suffers the intimate agony of the candle-flame.
I shift the flame further back again, so that it flutters and blisters her arsehole again; the smell is a mix of burning skin and searing sweat and her screams are demonic.
"AAAAAHHHH!!!!&nbsp; Stop-stop-stop I'll talk, I'll talk, I'll talk!!" Brenae shrieks in her awful agony.&nbsp; "Anne!&nbsp; Her name is Anne!&nbsp; Anne Guzzo!!"
I remove the candle.&nbsp; Smoke still drifts out from between her legs, and Brenae's breasts heave , her eyes rolling in disbelief at the agony that ravages her.&nbsp; "ohhhhh �"
"Tell me about Anne," I say.
"She is the witch, ask her, torture her, not me!" Brenae bleats, then bursts into tears of pain and misery.&nbsp; "Oh fuck, torture he-e-e-rrrr!!!"
"What is your association with her?"
"She is a witch, she seduced me, we made love!" Brenae wails.&nbsp; "She cast a spell on me, I was her lover many times!"
"And you, I suppose, were an innocent victim?&nbsp;&nbsp; Not a witch at all?"
"I swear I'm not a witch!" Brenae cries.
"Tell the truth!" I shout, and thrust the candle again between her legs.&nbsp; She clenches her teeth; but the flame licks her wounded sex and the pain returns, even worse than before, and her mouth opens in a terrible scream.
"Ooooaaaahhhh!!!&nbsp; I swear I swear I swear!!" she shrieks.&nbsp; She is trying, despite the hideous tension in her body, to buck her hips against the pain; but she cannot escape it.&nbsp; Fresh wisps of smoke and steam filter up through her pubes, and she yells her agony dementedly, but no admission 
I withdraw the candle.&nbsp; Not because I believe her, but because a stronger form of persuasion is required before she will condemn herself.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brenae has been secured on the wheel rack for almost three hours.&nbsp; In that time, her muscles have completely failed her, her joints have loosened, her ligaments and tendons have begun to swell and tear under the strain.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her pale skin is greasy with perspiration.&nbsp; The hair in her underarms is matted and wet, and the aroma of stale sweat and fear betrays her suffering.&nbsp; Her nipples, burned and blistered, still stand painfully into the air, swollen and forced to remain erect by the savage clips around their base.&nbsp; The reddened and blistered path down her solar plexus and abdomen is like a trail to the ugly, raw wound that is the remnants of her once-pretty navel.&nbsp; The thick coppery bush of hair between her thighs is flecked with solidified wax from the candle torture.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Between her upstretched arms, Brenae's head lolls against the iron-studded curve of the wheel rack, on the pillow of her splashed hair.&nbsp; Her brows are creased with her suffering, her eyelids heavy, eyes red-rimmed and cheeks streaked by tears.&nbsp; Her mouth is twisted in a constant grimace of anguish.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Save yourself more needless suffering, Brenae," I say.&nbsp; "Tell me where you have hidden the tools of your magic."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I have none," Brenae groans.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Where is Catherine Prynne?&nbsp; Who is your Lord Master Darkness?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I don't know!" Brenae says.&nbsp; "Please, when will you believe me?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"When you no longer care if you live or die," I say.&nbsp; "When you are ready to beg for death by fire, the truth will come easily from your lips."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No!" Brenae shrieks in horror.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Another notch," I tell Zell.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brenae's arched body is already stretched to its limit, the elasticity of sinew and ligaments painfully tested.&nbsp; As the rack groans and the big wheel turns, Brenae's wrists are hauled another fraction of an inch from her anchored feet, and she stretches further.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Aaaaaah!!"&nbsp; The agony explodes through her.&nbsp; Brenae gives a long scream of pain, unable to bear the torment.&nbsp; "No more!!&nbsp; It hurts - ohhh!!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"This is nothing," I promise her.&nbsp; "Tell me what I need to know."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brenae is shrieking and gasping.&nbsp; Unlike the localised pain of the candle torture, the rack delivers a horror that tears at her very bones, and will surely wrest the truth from her.&nbsp; Her eyes are wide and staring at the vaulted ceiling of the torture chamber as she gives a long wail of agony and despair.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Another notch," I say.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The rack groans, and Brenae gives a shrill scream as the pain tears and rips through her tormented body.&nbsp; Her stretching limbs are fiercely taut, muscles rigid, her ribcage stark below her heavy breasts.&nbsp; I can hear the creaks and groans of her joints as they are subjected to intolerable strain.&nbsp; Her hands are curled into claws beyond the wrist-shackles.&nbsp; Sweat is running down her sides.&nbsp; "Stop!&nbsp; Oh stop, please, stop!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Where is Catherine Prynne hiding?&nbsp; Tell me where!&nbsp; Who is your Lord Master Darkness?"
"I swear I don't know!"
"Where are your pagan talismans?&nbsp; Talk, Witch!"
"I have none, I have none!" she insists in a high voice.
"Another notch," I tell Zell.
"Please don't stretch me!!" Brenae screeches; but Zell forces the winch, and she gives an awful scream as her body stretches a fraction further.&nbsp; I have suffered on the wheel rack, and I know how tearing and all-engulfing its pain is; ultimately I believe it to be worse even than burning alive, as every sinew and fibre is distended, but the nerves remain intact to feel every moment of it.
I give Brenae time to suffer.&nbsp; There is no urgency, and the pain will only worsen.&nbsp; Stretched this tightly, she cannot draw deep enough breath to maintain her screams, but she cannot stay silent, either.&nbsp; Every moment she groans and gasps and wails, lost in her nightmare of agony.&nbsp; 
When ten long minutes have passed, I give Zell the order to turn the wheel again.&nbsp; The heavy machine creaks, and Brenae's body stretches a little more.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; "Oh God!!&nbsp; My hips, my hips!!&nbsp; Aiieeee!!"&nbsp; Suddenly she is slamming her own head against the studded wood of the rack, half mad with the pain that tears at her hips.&nbsp; It must feel as if her body is being slowly pulled apart - and it is.&nbsp; As Brenae screams and howls in agony, there is a slow creak from her left hip.
A moment later, her hip bone rips from its socket with a sound like tearing roots.&nbsp; Brenae's screams are hideous; her pelvis tilts oddly, her body half-skewed on the wheel rack, and all the strain is loaded onto her right hip.&nbsp; It is only a matter of seconds before, with a deep sucking sound, it too pulls out of place.&nbsp; Her legs have lengthened by an inch or more, and the pain is beyond imagination.
Nausea comes suddenly, as her body struggles to comprehend the sheer magnitude of pain&nbsp;&nbsp; Her drum-tight belly heaves and spasms, and liquid gurgles in her throat between her cries of pain.&nbsp; The tendons through her armpits look taut like steel cables, and I know that her shoulders will be the next to go; then her knees, then her elbows.&nbsp; Her spine, too, is on fire with agony.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Listen to me, Brenae.&nbsp; This is just the beginning,"  I tell her.&nbsp; "I can have you stretched inches more.&nbsp; Inches. I will keep you here for days if I have to." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It takes Brenae another minute to be able to form a reply, and even then it is only a hoarse whimper, "I'll talk, oh, oh oh, I'll talk �!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Where are the tools of your magic, Brenae?&nbsp; What spells have you worked?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Aahhh � the university � a locker � ohh � it's all there �"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What are the spells you cast?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I bewitched � uhh � my professor � for grades �" she gasps.&nbsp; Her eyes are staring and dark with suffering as she struggles to draw enough air to speak.&nbsp; Her body creaks with every breath.&nbsp; Her ribcage looks as if it is about to burst out through her skin.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You cast a bewitching spell on your professor for higher grades?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes � yes � !"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"So you admit you are a witch �?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Please don't make me say it �" Brenae sobs through her agony.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Zell," I begin to order another turn of the handle.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I admit!&nbsp; I'm a witch!&nbsp; I'm a witch!&nbsp; No more, don�t stretch me any more, oh � ple-ease �"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Finally, you confess.&nbsp; You could have saved yourself a lot of pain," I tell her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm sorry, I'm sorry �" Brenae sobs.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But it is not over.&nbsp; "There is more to discuss, Brenae," I say.&nbsp; "Catherine Prynne.&nbsp; And your Lord Master Darkness."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A long moan of dread and horror comes from Brenae's gaping mouth.&nbsp; "Please, I swear, I don't know!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Stretch her, Zell," I say.
"No-o-o-o-o!!!!" Brenae screams; but the wheel-rack turns.&nbsp; As her body is forced to stretch again, her left shoulder snaps out of joint with a crack, its outward geography distending visibly.&nbsp; Brenae howls in agony.&nbsp; The right holds out for a few long seconds, then pops cleanly out.&nbsp; The ravaging pain sends Brenae into a shrieking madness, now too great even for her to move her head.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bowed across the wheel rack, her body shining wet and running with sweat, every muscle stark and defined and both hips and shoulders now dislocated, Brenae is in Hell.&nbsp; Her screaming has become a high-pitched whimpering as she gasps like a fish out of water. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Please �" she moans.&nbsp; "Please, please, please �"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Where is Catherine?&nbsp; Who is your Lord Master Darkness?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brenae rolls her head from side to side.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Give her a notch to remind her," I say to Zell.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Aaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!"&nbsp; Brenae is cawing hoarsely the moment the wheel begins to move; even though its turn stretches her only a fraction of an inch, it is wrested from tearing tendons, strained muscles and separated joints, and it is mortal agony.&nbsp; Her body is tight and distended across the studded curve, her hands and feet crushed into the iron shackles at either extreme.&nbsp; The sweat is running down her body, streaking the rack beneath her.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I swear I don't know," she squeaks.&nbsp; "Only Catherine knows the Lord Master � and where she is � I don't know, I swear �"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She pisses herself.&nbsp; She isn't even aware of it happening.&nbsp; Just a dribble to the floor.&nbsp; It is all Brenae can do simply to draw breath and groan in agony.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am sure that she never imagined, in all her life, that she could suffer so much.&nbsp; We would all like to believe that, at a certain point, we would lose consciousness; or endorphins or adrenaline would override much of the pain.&nbsp; But delivered slowly, with slowly-increasing intensity, a machine such as the rack ensures that she feels every shred of agony acutely and without a moment's relief.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Zell � again."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Zell forces the crank around.&nbsp; Creaking comes from both the wheel rack itself, and the woman stretching upon it.&nbsp; Brenae's body is forced to concede another fraction of an inch, and the agony worsens, drawing another long cry of agony from her throat.&nbsp; The muscles of her back are beginning to tear, and it is like being sliced through with red-hot knives.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brenae keeps trying to scream for ten long minutes, her eyes wide and her mouth open, her scorched belly heaving with agony and shallow breath.&nbsp; Even that tiny motion sends waves of terrible, tearing pain through her displaced bones.&nbsp; If she could wish herself dead, I have no doubt that she would.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When at last her croaking shrieks subside to moans again, she remains sweating and agonised across the arc of the wheel, but gives no further information.&nbsp; It seems probable that she does not know where Catherine Prynne is, nor the identity of her Lord Master Darkness; but it will do no harm to let her suffer a little longer, just to be sure.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I tell her, "I will return in an hour to see if you have remembered."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Despite her agony, Brenae gasps out a desperate plea.&nbsp; "No � please, please, don't leave me like this � I can't stand the pain � "  Her eyes swim with tears.  "Just let me die, please, let me di-i-i-ie!!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It may be agony beyond all understanding, but Brenae is not in any danger of dying.&nbsp; I am reminded of the story of Anne Askew, a historical figure who was racked so severely that not only was every joint dislocated; her spine was literally pulled apart.&nbsp; Unable to walk, she was carried to the stake, bound tightly to it, and burned alive.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Give her water, then leave her here," I tell Zell.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As usual, I return to my office and display Brenae on my monitor.&nbsp; Her body, arched long and gleaming over the studded curve of the wheel, her face framed by the splash of her abundant red hair.&nbsp; Sweat glistens in streaks from her dark-thatched armpits and polishes her full and lifted breasts.&nbsp; Her tortured nipples still stand helplessly erect, trapped by the savage clips around them.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her thighs and calves are defined and tight from the strain, strain that has already pulled her hips and shoulders out of place, stretched her spine and torn the muscles of her belly on their&nbsp; moorings.&nbsp; So tightly stretched, she cannot even move; and yet I know that every nerve is screaming out in agony, every minute she is left to suffer is like a lifetime of sheer, unrelenting hell.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is a sobering reality; but it is necessary to ensure I have wrung the last drop of truth from her lips.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the monitor, I see a shadow.&nbsp; A dark figure, shifting against a background of even-deeper darkness.&nbsp; What the hell?&nbsp; It takes just a moment to nudge the mouse, brightening the image, zooming the camera in, and my jaw drops.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Catherine Prynne.&nbsp; The witch herself, in the simple and dowdy uniform of a cleaning-woman, sneaking through the torture chamber.&nbsp; I can't see her face, but her body language tells me that she is intent upon one thing; the wheel rack, and its suffering victim.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I snatch up my cell phone and run.&nbsp; Going as fast as I can, it will still be a minute from my quarters to the torture chamber; barrelling down corridors, fumbling with keys and locked doors, scampering down slimy stairs into the chill darkness. I hit Zell's speed dial.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Get to the dungeons now!" I yell at him, hang up, and dial Austin with the same hasty message.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I skid into the last, long corridor; the split-skirt of my leather dress flying up behind me like Batman's cape as I run.&nbsp; I can see, outside the open door to the torture chamber, the two guards, both slumped in the floor in a stupor.&nbsp; Drugged, or hypnotised, or under some magic spell. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A moment later, I cautiously poke my head around the door of the torture chamber.&nbsp; There is silence, save the echoed drip of water, the fluttering of torches on the walls, and the hollow, rasping moans of Brenae, somewhere in the darkness.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I slip my shoes off, and, barefoot on the cold and clammy flagstones, creep quickly into the chamber, darting from one stone pillar to the next.&nbsp; I see her, Catherine, alongside the wheel rack; she has her hand on Brenae's forehead, muttering some soothing incantation to the agonised woman.&nbsp; She has not yet figured out how to loosen the ratchet mechanism, so Brenae's torment is yet unrelieved.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I run.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Catherine hears the sound of my approach, glances fearfully over her shoulder, then bolts, running deeper into the torture chamber.&nbsp; She runs, but I'm faster, and I close the distance on her in a matter of seconds, flinging myself into a diving tackle.&nbsp; My arms catch around her thighs, and she falls, landing hard on the stone floor, me on top of her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No!" Catherine shrieks, trying to scramble to her feet.&nbsp; Scrambling to my knees, I lock my arm around her throat and haul her backwards so that she is arched up off the floor.&nbsp; Desperately, she claws at my arm, scratching my skin painfully.&nbsp; She begins to make choking noises.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Stop struggling, Witch!" I shout.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Let me go!!" Catherine rasps.&nbsp; Reaching back, she fixes both hands in my hair, and pulls, hard.&nbsp; I grit my teeth against the pain, but she uses the distraction to get one leg beneath her torso and launch us both up-and-over.&nbsp; I half-side over her shoulder, loosening my grip on her throat, and tumble onto my side as Catherine scrabbles back, gasping and whooping for air.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I'm on my feet again in a moment, but so is Catherine, her fingernails poised like talons, and teeth bared, ready to rip my flesh.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh, for heaven's sake," I say, and step in towards her.&nbsp; She lashes out at me; I roll under her claws and come out to throw a left hook to the side of her head with the heel of my hand.&nbsp; Catherine shrieks, stumbles, and is left completely open to a solid uppercut into her solar plexus that drives the air from her lungs with a shriek.&nbsp; It steals the support of her legs, and she drops to her knees, clutching her stomach.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I hear running feet; Zell, racing into the torture chamber.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Where did she come from?" he exclaims, as he sees the gasping witch on the floor.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Who knows?&nbsp; Who cares!&nbsp; Just bag her!" I say breathlessly.
It takes just a moment for Zell to wrench Catherine's wrists behind her and bind them tightly; he has barely finished when Austin appears, breathing hard from his run down into the dungeon.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Strip her clothes off and burn them," I order.&nbsp; "Search her for potions and amulets, then take her to a cell and make sure she's chained to the wall, with a guard posted at all times.&nbsp; And bring the key to me.&nbsp; She won't get away from us again!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Austin hauls the captured witch to her feet, I say to Zell, "fetch the physician � there's nothing more we need from Brenae.&nbsp; Take her off the rack and return her to her cell, so she may recover in time for her burning."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For Brenae Bailey, at least, the capture of Catherine Prynne is good news.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It has been weeks since Brenae Bailey was broken on the rack; finally the swelling has subsided from her joints and tendons, and she is able to walk, albeit with difficulty.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now, she stands naked, bound to the stake for burning.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is a bitterly chill winter�s day; the wind blows from the north and it would barely be more than fifty Fahrenheit.&nbsp; Brenae is shivering without clothes, and there is vapour on her breath.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her wrists have been pulled around and behind the stake, there lashed with thick ropes.&nbsp; Nothing else secures her; by the time the rope burns through, she will be already close to death.&nbsp; Her lush, thick mane of red hair is draped over one pale shoulder, a cascade against her feminine curves; her heavy breasts rise and fall with every fearful breath, their nipples rosy again despite the wounds that had been inflicted upon them by the candle.&nbsp; The deeper-hued bush of her pubic hair is a broad and curly mat across her loins, stark contrast with the paleness of her skin, and already I have heard speculation at how well it will burn.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That is something about which Brenae, I am sure, does not want to think.&nbsp; She has been crying for much of the night in her cell, overcome by fear of what this day will bring.&nbsp; Even now, her eyes are red-rimmed, her lips puffy, although she is doing her best to hide her fear from the crowd.&nbsp; Despite having been utterly broken by the rack and the tortures inflicted upon her, despite being naked and bound to the stake in the open winter air, she still holds on to the tattered shreds of her dignity, and is trying to conceal her absolute terror.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She will not conceal it for long.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is not a large crowd in the amphitheatre; perhaps just a couple of hundred.&nbsp; they're wrapped in coats and jackets and scarves, defence against the cold, and looking forward to the cheery warmth of a good fire.&nbsp; Steve, the executioner, warms his hands at the brazier that will light Brenae's oak-wood pyre; smoke, riding the brisk wind, casts the dusky smell of burning coal across the amphitheatre.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Witchseekers, ladies and gentlemen!"&nbsp; From my place on the scaffold, I signal for attention, and a silence falls.&nbsp; "Brenae Bailey, the woman before you today, has been charged with crimes of Witchcraft, which include using the tarot, casting bewitching spells over those in authority, and freely associating with other witches.&nbsp; To these crimes, she has confessed."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A cheer, from the crowd.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"As is the fitting punishment for one convicted as a witch, I now sentence Brenae Bailey to be burned alive at the stake, and her ashes cast on unhallowed ground!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A bigger cheer, met by a cry from Brenae, finally giving voice to her anguish as the sentence is finally announced.&nbsp; Even as the crowd still applauds, Steve has lit a torch in the brazier, and brings it across to the low pile of wood upon which Brenae stands naked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The wind blows the flame out.&nbsp; Only a thick ribbon of smoke whips from the end of the torch, and Steve curses, returning to the brazier.&nbsp; Brenae gives another shout of misery; the crowd laughs.&nbsp; I can only imagine how painfully Brenae's heart must thud inside her chest: the flame extinguished means a few more precious seconds free of agony, a few more moments that she can gaze at the world, and breathe its air.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Steve has the torch in the coals again, rolling it so that the flame catches properly.&nbsp; This time, shielding it with his hand, he returns to the stake.&nbsp; Brenae turns her face to the sky, too terrified to watch as Steve bends to light the outer fringe of wood and straw.&nbsp; She is shaking violently, and no longer merely with cold.&nbsp; I see her tugging her hands against the ropes that bind them, she bunching and shifting of muscles through her shoulders and arms as she struggles to pull free of her bonds.&nbsp; Never mind that she would have nowhere to run, that she would simply be re-tied if she did manage to escape.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The flames at her feet grow in sweeping flurries through the kindling.&nbsp; At times, a gust of wind almost extinguishes the flames, driving them back; but when the wind ebbs, the fire rallies again, gaining a little more ground.&nbsp; Even so, it is a tortuously slow advance.&nbsp; It takes almost twenty minutes for the fire to properly take hold.&nbsp; In the moments of stillness, the smoke lazily curls itself around Brenae's naked legs and upwards, ethereal tentacles exploring the contours of her body.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brenae sobs and tries to keep her face turned upwards, but eventually fear forces her to check the progress of the fire.&nbsp; It is then that she sees the bright flames that dance beneath the tightly-bundled wood below her feet.&nbsp; It is enough to make her cry out in terror, and begin sobbing uncontrollably.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another gust of wind blows icily across the open amphitheatre; but now, it only fans the flames.&nbsp; They roar hungrily, crackling up through the wood with renewed vigour.&nbsp; The smoke streams out, low across the ground, and embers fly.&nbsp; Brenae shrinks back against the stake, now able to feel the heat on her lower legs and feet.&nbsp; She cannot face the fire, she cannot bear to look at the crowd, eager to witness her suffering.&nbsp; She cannot close her eyes, her terror too intense.&nbsp; So she fixes her gaze to the treetops beyond the amphitheatre, as if trying to wish herself out of this nightmare and into the dull grey sky.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The wind dies down, the flames leap up within inches of her legs.&nbsp; The heat is enough to scorch her skin, and she throws her head back, her skull cracking against the wood of the stake as her legs take on a pink hue; she turns her face to me, her eyes wide in horror.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Kirsten, please!&nbsp; Not like this!&nbsp; I don't deserve this, please!"&nbsp; Her voice is shaking with panic and terror, her shoulders writhe in an odd kind of shimmy as she tries to free her wrists from behind the stake.&nbsp; "Please, oh God, please, just kill me now!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But it is not appropriate to show mercy to a witch.&nbsp; She should suffer, she should feel every moment of the pain, and I will ensure that she does.&nbsp; I say nothing, merely watching as the flames flicker and leap around her legs.&nbsp; A shimmering wall of heat encloses her, the wall of isolation that separates the condemned from the spectators.&nbsp; Sparks and embers skitter up Brenae's naked body, and she begins to jerk and jolt from their searing bite, shifting her legs, lifting one knee and then the other.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Aaah!!&nbsp; Ohh!&nbsp; Please, please, help me!"
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The flames' heat begins to burn her feet and legs, and Brenae's body goes into an animal response.&nbsp; She screams in wild pain and panic, thrashing and twisting, stomping her feet and raising a fireworks-cascade of embers and sparks; rocking her shoulders so that her heavy breasts jiggle and swing, her thick mane of hair whipping about in the updraft.&nbsp; Beneath her screams, I can hear the hissing of fluids as her skin sears.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She tugs and tugs to pull her hands free from behind the stake, but the rope will not release her, and she is held in the growing fire, despite the pain, despite her awful desperation to get away.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Steam wisps from her shining thighs as the flames grow and leap; a few rising embers draw smoke from her thick bush of coppery pubic hair.&nbsp; Pain has delivered her into a madness of panic and terror, focusing her entire existence into a red haze of agony and desperation.&nbsp; Her head shakes violently as the flames blister and rend the flesh of her legs.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The razor tongues of fire gradually reach higher, and suddenly a skitter of bright orange flame rushes through her pubic bush; I can see that it has spread back, charring the hair between the cheeks of her ass as well, and the sensitive flesh now receives the flaying, terrible licks of fire, tearing the skin away and bringing harsh and unrelenting agony to the exposed nerves.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brenae screams and shrieks and thrashes in her bonds.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Black smoke begins to roll upwards, as the oils of Brenae's body ignite and lazily burn like a greasy candle.&nbsp; Her eyes are bugging with the agony of it all, and as the flames reach higher, following the curve of her buttocks, fluttering over her hips and peeling the skin away from her body, she shakes and twists and screams in terrible pain.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I keep my eyes on her, knowing that terrible minutes still lie ahead for her.&nbsp; The agony of burning must be compounded by the terrible panic of being alight, the horror of knowing that such a terrible death has been deliberately inflicted by her peers.&nbsp; The shimmering coccoon of heat that surrounds Brenae now reddens and blisters the flesh of her breasts and arms, and flames dart up towards her fingers behind the stake.&nbsp; The rope is smouldering; but her fingers, too, are burning, the nails curling, the flesh sizzling and dripping fluids.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Splinters of the stake itself are catching alight as the fire, building on itself exponentially, roars ever higher.&nbsp; The flames have reached her breasts, and the thick red mane of her hair catches alight.&nbsp; Fire explodes around Brenae's face and scalp, and her screams are shrill and frantic.&nbsp; The pain is so awful that she flings her head back against the post, a heavy thud! reverberating through the wood.&nbsp; Again, and again, she smashes her head against the stake, trying now simply to kill herself and end the pain, as her hair burns away and her scalp is reduced to char.&nbsp; 
The fire roars and wraps around her, mini-tornado twists of flame spiralling up around her writhing body as she screams and shrieks.&nbsp; The hissing and crackling of her burning body is clear above the thunder of the flames.&nbsp; Although the flames have already reached their peak, jumping no higher than her breasts, it will be enough to kill her.&nbsp; Her ravaged head slams back against the post, her eyes shut and streaming from smoke and heat, her mouth open, lips cracked and seared. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Crackling, hissing, screaming, Brenae burns for long minutes, and her struggles slowly weaken.&nbsp; She continues to writhe and twist, held against the stake, raising clouds of sparks and embers as the black smoke of her burning flesh rolls into the sky.&nbsp; Her legs and feet are already lifeless, turning to char, the bones splitting and bursting open, fluids bubbling and hissing away.&nbsp; Gradually, as pain and heat take their toll, Brenae�s shoulders slump and her body begins to lean heavily into the fire, as her skin is torn and split by the ravaging flames.&nbsp; The life is escaping from her flesh like steam; her eyes roll back and her head nods forward.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The crowd gives a cheer, seeing that the witch has finally surrendered to the flames.&nbsp; Her mouth is still open, but her screams have faded to a long, awful rattle as the last of the breath wisps from her lungs. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She does not scream again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I let the fire burn on for another hour, until the remains of Brenae Bailey�s body fold into the midst of the inferno and there is nothing left but ash and shattered bones.
