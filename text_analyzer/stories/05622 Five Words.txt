&nbsp;

Part One: July

&nbsp;

�Does your offer still stand ?�

&nbsp;

Five Words.

Just Five Words. The five words that changed his life. The handful of words that turned him from a husband, father and
successful businessman into something else entirely. This is the true
story of a man who really did live the dream that many male submissives think
they would like to turn into reality. Ignore that baloney about it all being
fiction in the disclaimer above. Kelly and Mart are
actual people and the events certainly happened, pretty much exactly as laid
out here.

&nbsp;

It was the first evening of the rest of
their lives. Their daughter had left home and moved to Los Angeles to live with
her American boyfriend. They were alone together in the big house on the south
coast of England that they had purchased with the proceeds of the sale of their
company. Kelly was still only 38 and Mart was 42. They were both dynamic
enough, rich enough and young enough to do exactly as they wanted with the rest
of their lives.

&nbsp;

�Does your offer still stand ?�

It referred to an offer he
had made her six years earlier. It was after a role play session they had
managed to squeeze into their busy schedule of business entertaining, social
engagements and looking after their teenage daughter.

A bit of Fem Dom suited both
of them. Nothing heavy, just a bit of mild bdsm fun.
Mart was much keener than her. He would have liked to play their games as often
as possible, but Kelly had been happy with play once every four to six weeks.
He wanted to push on to a deeper level, while she said she was apprehensive of
where it all might lead.

Above all, Chantal, their
daughter, was around most of the time. It was only those occasional Saturday
nights she spent with grandparents or friends that created the opportunity for �fun
and games�.

&nbsp;

�When she�s grown
up, we could live like this twenty four seven.� Mart said once, only half
joking.

�Be careful what you wish
for.� Kelly replied, basking in the hazy afterglow of alcohol and endorphins.

�I mean it.� He said,
suddenly serious. �I want to be your slave. No limits. Full
time. You can have it all.�

�Is that an offer ?� she giggled.

&nbsp;

After that, it became their
private joke. Each New Year�s Eve, they�d kiss and she�d whisper in his ear.

�I�m still mulling over your
offer you know.�

Gradually, their sex life
had evolved. They had met when she was 18 and he was 22. She was a virgin, he
was inexperienced. The early years were typical; plenty of missionary sex, some
oral and a bit of experimentation with the likes of blindfolds, dirty movies
and, once, golden showers.

The next decade was
predictable too. A decline in frequency and quality, as work, parenthood and
over-familiarity got in the way. Mart pushed about twice a week and Kelly did
her wifely duty.

Role play was something they
only got into relatively late. At first, it was always Mart topping from the
bottom, although Kelly learned what she liked. She realised that sex was better
if it was about her needs.

Somehow they fumbled along,
sticking together, still in love.

And after �the offer� was made, Kelly
very gradually began to take more control.

&nbsp;

�Does your offer still stand ?�

Five Words. They hung in the
sultry air. It was a warm evening. Saturday, 8th July 2006.

They�d both already shared
almost an entire bottle of pink champagne.

He gulped, staring into her
mischievous brown eyes.

�Er � sure.�

�This time, I mean it.� She
said. �Now Chantal�s gone, I want to be your Mistress. No limits. Full time. I want it all, just like you said.�

He looked at her, then finally exhaled a long breath. Phew.

�No limits
?�

She shook her head, then pushed her brunette hair back off her shoulders.

�None.�

The atmosphere was humid,
thick and tense. He suddenly realised she had prepared for the occasion; a sexy
linen dress that accentuated her curves and cleavage, more make up than usual,
and her hair done up.

�Wow !�
he chuckled nervously.

�This isn�t a game, Mart.
I�m not playing. This is your one chance. We can carry on as we have for twenty
years and forget this whole conversation. Or we can do it. But we can only do
things my way. And you may not like that.�

�You�ve been thinking about
this for a while, haven�t you ?�

A pause. �Yes.�

She held out her empty glass
and he got up to fill hers. Then he went to top up his own.

�No.� she said firmly. �No
more for you.�

She�d been nagging at him to
cut down on the booze and step up the jogging for a couple of years. He�d
pretty much ignored her.

�Is � that a test ?�

�Hardly. I�m afraid
�tests� will be much harder than that ?�

He tipped the remainder of
the champagne into her glass instead and put the empty bottle down.

�Fetch me a bowl. The big red salad one from the lower cupboard.�

On autopilot, he obeyed her.
When he returned, she had hiked up her summer dress and removed her thong. She
was standing with a crooked grin on her face.

�Hold it for me.�

They had done a golden
shower once before, years earlier. But never in his face or mouth. It wasn�t
something that turned him on so he�d never suggested it. Nor had she until
tonight.

�Kneel.�

He got down and held the
bowl under her thighs as she opened her legs and lowered her hips. He fixed his
eyes on her labia.

�No.� she said. �From now on
you don�t even peek at me there unless you are invited. Look up into my eyes
instead.�

He raised his head and stared
intently. Her eyes were like deep, moonlit pools. Her expression was amused,
loving but � different.

He heard a hiss and then the
sound of her urine spraying the bowl. He felt a fine mist of splashback
settling on his skin. The scent was strong, recognisable. The fluid sloshed as
she kept filling the bowl.

Eventually, after over half
a minute, she was finished.

�Now decant that all into
the empty bottle.�

&nbsp;

From that evening onwards, he only ever
drank alcohol �second hand�. It was one of the many small ways she tormented
him. Mart had always enjoyed a drink and he had steadily built up a pretty good
cellar of fine wines. Serving bottles of vintage Bordeaux and Burgundy to
Kelly, and her friends and visitors, hurt a lot, even after he had become used
to a totally alcohol free regime. Meanwhile, there were always a dozen or so
bottles of �golden nectar� brewing in the cellar for him, alongside the wines
he had collected.

&nbsp;

�Yes. My offer stands.�

She nodded slowly.

Was this what she really wanted ?

Yes, the honest truth was,
she did. For too many reasons to go into now. But it
was still a strange moment. A step into the dark. What
awaited her ?

�Then I accept.� She
replied.

They chinked glasses. She smiled at his
expression, as if he�d eaten a lemon, toasting his imminent slavery in her
still warm, frothy and sour urine.

�Er � how do you want to �
you know � start ?�

�Right away.�

�This minute
? Tonight ?�

�Yes.� She said. �But first
I want you to know a bit about what you are getting into. A
few rules.�

She watched him dry-swallow,
his sexy green eyes wide. She�d always loved his eyes. They were the first
thing she�d noticed about him all those years ago. They�d never changed, even
while his biceps had softened, his waist had thickened and his curly hair had
thinned.

�You are going to live a one
third, one third, one third life. What I mean by that
is that you will spend one third - or eight hours a day - doing domestic work
for me, another eight hours at work in a job somewhere, and you�ll have eight
hours for sleeping, washing, and the rest. And that will be your routine seven
days a week from now on.�

He was obviously shocked.

�But � we don�t need money.
I can stay here all day.�

She took a long swig of her
champagne.

�This isn�t going to work if
you query every single one of my decisions. I know we don�t need the
money. For that very reason you are going to do a manual labour job on a
minimum wage. It�s to get you out of the house.�

He shut his eyes in a long
blink.

�As I said, this isn�t a
game, Mart.� She kept her voice as controlled as possible. Quiet but firm. �I�m
not playing a role this time. But we have to do things my way and I
warned you that you might not like it. Now I�m going to ask you one last time.
Do you want to do this, or not ?�

He was beaten. And he knew
it. So did she.

�Yes � please.�

�Right. I need space. So
you are going to do a job afternoons and evenings. On at
least six days a week, usually seven, and most weeks of the year unless I take
you abroad. As I said, it will be a minimum wage job, and we�ll find a
use for the pittance you earn soon enough.�

The words were flowing more
easily now. She felt confident. This was going to work. She felt a flush on her
neck, and moist down below.

�Get down on your knees,
Mart.�

He didn�t leap to obey, but
he did as she told him.

�Lift my dress and remove my
pants.�

She took her weight on her
arms so he could lower her thong. They had done this several times, in role
play and at other times, but she had never, ever ordered him to do it with such
calm assurance.

�Do me while I talk.�

She parted her thighs and
shivered as his tongue split her gummy folds. For a while, she didn�t speak,
just shut her eyes and sighed.

�In the mornings and early
afternoons, you�ll do all the house and garden chores.
And drive me about, run errands, that kind of thing. Seven days a week. Understood.�

It wasn�t really a question
at all. She didn�t encourage him to respond. Instead she hitched her knees up
over the sides of the chair so she was splayed wider and her buttocks shifted
forwards.

�And you will also go
running and follow a fitness and diet regime set by me. I like my men to look
young and fit, Mart.�

She tugged his curls,
shifting his mouth to where she wanted it. Yesss.

�Most importantly of all, my
love, your days of masturbation are over. You think I don�t know what you get
up to in your office at night !�

She pulled at his curls,
making him wince and gasp. She was humping his face now, grinding her swollen
clit onto his tongue.

�And I know the idea of
chastity is something that turns you on. Well,� she gasped, �� let�s s �
see if real ch � astity can � mmm � be used to turn you off as well !�

She mashed her hips
excitedly, enveloping his lower face.

�Kiss my ass.�

His lips circled her rim and
his stiff wet tongue made her squeal out loud.

&nbsp;

From that evening onwards, analingus went
from being something that she had previously only enjoyed during their role
play, having bathed and scented herself, to become the basis of their foreplay
instead. It was amazing how taking up his offer of a 24/7 relationship,
unleashed in her desires and kinks she would never have thought possible. It
was his mouth � via rigorously brushed teeth four times a day, and gums swilled
with mouthwash before and after sex � that now bore responsibility for hygiene.
Her bottom was, after all, required to perform its natural bodily functions and
she couldn�t always be bathing and perfuming herself just because she fancied a
bit of anal worship.

&nbsp;

�May I ask one question ?� he asked, after she had recovered from her
climax. He had never seen her orgasm as completely and noisily as that.

Was this what he really wanted ?

Yes, the honest truth was,
it was. Nevertheless, it was one thing to fantasise. It was quite another to
try and make it reality. And it was something else again to carry it through,
no strings, full time, forever.

She looked down at him in a
half-smile and slowly nodded.

�Ask away.�

�Is this like � er, permanent ?�

�Yes. Well, maybe when we�re
in our seventies we�ll call it a day ! Who knows ? But until then, yup, it�s permanent.�

�How ��

She put her finger to her
lips, telling him to shut up.

�I�ve given it a lot of thought. You need
a threat hanging over you. So I�ve drawn up divorce papers and an agreement
giving me all our assets and money. We�ll both sign the documents tomorrow and
I�ll keep them undated in the safe. I won�t abandon you Mart. But the only way
you�ll get out of our arrangement is by starting life again from scratch. Poor and alone.�

He shivered. His ultimate fantasy. But � she was making it
reality.

She was evidently awaiting
an answer.

He nodded. �Okay.�

�Is that all
?�

He had so many questions but
he was afraid to ask.

�Do you still love me ?�

She frowned. He saw genuine
confusion in her shadowy eyes. She�d obviously expected him to ask anything but
that.

�Sure.� She said finally.
�Do you love me, even though you want � this ?�

�More than
anything in the world.�

�Exactly. Well I still
love you. But it won�t always seem that way. Are you ready for that ?�

Her smile was soft. He looked at her,
dreading what he was getting into. He realised that he would no longer just be
able to reach out and touch her, fondle her breasts, stroke her butt, kiss her
mouth, whenever he liked.

�Yes. I think so.�

�Stand up.�

He rose to his feet, standing
to attention in front of her.

�Drop your pants.�

He undid his belt,
unbuttoned and lowered his trousers and briefs.

She smiled at his
semi-erection.

�This conversation exciting
you, Mart, or making you afraid ?�

�A bit of both.�

�Undecided, eh ?�

Her long, slim beautiful
fingers reached out and one hand cupped his balls.

�You will never masturbate
again, Mart.� She said. �Never. Not so long as you
stay with me. Do you understand that ?�

He didn�t comprehend. Couldn�t. But he bowed his head in acceptance anyway.

�I may masturbate you instead. Very occasionally. But more likely we will make love. The
more you please me, the more we might do it. But from now on every release will
have to be earned. Earned the hard way.�

And boy was he hard.

She ran a teasing finger up
the underside of his shaft.

�Do you want to come ?�

�Pl � please � yes �� He
could barely speak.

She chuckled.

The longest they had played
this tease and denial game so far was 36 hours, during a long weekend the
previous summer when Chantal was staying over with friends. It had nearly
driven him mad.

She started to pump him
casually, up and down, in a too-slow rhythm.

�I should come quickly if I
were you. I may get bored.�

He shut his eyes,
concentrating, willing his balls to explode.

�Look at me.�

He wrenched them open and
focused on her amused expression.

He had jacked himself off
the evening before. A quick, sordid jerk off on the toilet.
It served no purpose other than to feed his habit. Mart knew he was a
masturbation junkie who needed a regular fix.

And now ?

�If you come, I want you to know that it
will be the last time for at least one month, probably much longer.�

He whimpered. His knees were
trembling, his thighs felt like jelly.

�My arm�s tiring.� She said,
hand slowing further.

Please !

�I � I �� he gasped.

And then he felt the
marvellous moment of no return. Yessssss.

She pulled her fingers away as he
stiffened and grimaced.

�Nah � plz � gnng ��

His erection jerked and he
humped thin air, seeking any sort of friction. He raised his right hand but she
slapped it down. A single jet of semen spurted straight upwards and then fell
in a raindrop at her feet. But there was no follow through. A second globule
gathered at the tip of his twitching penis and slowly oozed onto the floor. No more
appeared.

There was a silence of over
thirty seconds while he composed himself.

�Now.� She said
nonchalantly. �Let�s get you locked up, shall we ?�

&nbsp;

She had secretly purchased
four different chastity devices in preparation; Two
were for day to day use, reputedly 100% secure, but more comfortable and
discreet. Two were for wearing at home, both made of steel, one designed to
inflict pain in the event of even the slightest erection. In future, they kept
his genital area shaved and creamed to prevent chafing and she unlocked him
most days for cleaning, hygiene and depilation with her leg hair remover.
Further chastity devices were soon to follow, two fitted to size, until she was
totally happy with her entire array. Mart�s cock and balls belonged to her !

&nbsp;

It was just after ten that
night, when she closed the guest room door. He was tied naked to the big brass
bed, wrists and ankles cuffed to the four posts. He wasn�t going anywhere, that was for sure.

�Goodnight.� She whispered,
opening a window. �Don�t let the bugs bite.�

�Goodnight.� He replied. �Mistress.�

She turned and smiled,
puckering her lips in a kiss.

�We�ve got a busy day
tomorrow.� She switched on a bright lamp by the open window. It wouldn�t be
long before the mosquitoes and bugs were attracted to the light. And the tasty
flesh on display. She didn�t enjoy hurting him. But, if the
insects did her dirty work, well �

She shut the door and leaned
against it with a sigh.

Phew. She needed a drink.

Downstairs, she poured
herself a small brandy. She rarely drank spirits but tonight was an occasion
for exceptions. After taking a sip, she fetched her cell phone from inside her
bag and dialled.

Voicemail picked up.

Kelly waited a moment for
the beep.

The message she left was
brief. Just five words in fact.

�Hi � I have done it.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

End of Part One

To be continued in Part Two
(�August�)

&nbsp;

AUTHOR�S NOTE

&nbsp;

I would like
to thank all those readers who have posted reviews or emailed feedback. My
original intention was to post one Part per month over a year but due to the
strong response to this story, I have decided to speed up the process. Parts
Two, Three and Four will follow before the end of July 2007. I�m afraid that I
know I will not be able to please everybody in the months to come; some want
cruelty, others romance, many like cuckolding, some do not, quite
a few want lesbianism. Please feel free to keep sending me your thoughts and
ideas.

FIVE WORDS

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Part Two: August

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The first four weeks were, in several
ways, the most intense of all.

&nbsp;

As July turned to August,
the long days and sultry nights allowed both of them time to absorb the changes
in their relationship. Each day brought with it something new; sometimes subtle
shifts and nuances, other times blunt and shocking events that were like doors
slamming on their past.

&nbsp;

The restaurant was on the
edge of their nearest town. It was the best place around and they�d eaten at it
several times before; romantic atmosphere, French-Asian fusion cuisine,
exciting chef-proprietor, great wine list.

Kelly sat in the back while
Mart drove. She was dressed in a long T-shirt dress that barely covered her
thighs. Her legs looked amazing.

By car, it only took them
fifteen minutes.

But, of course, Mart would
have to travel there every day on foot and by bus. The journey would take him a
ten minute walk followed by a twenty minute ride on the rickety village coach.

�I figured out a cover story for you.�
She said, peering over her sunglasses.

He glanced in the mirror,
listening.

It was still only the day after �the
offer�. Was it really only the previous evening that she had asked him if his
offer still stood ? Was it less than 24 hours since he
had been a normal husband, father, man ?

�I told Alain you�re
researching a book you�re writing. I said it�s about a guy who washes dishes
for a living. You can make up the rest if anybody asks. Alain was cool about
it.�

Mart changed gear. The shifting motion
made him aware of his new chastity tube.

�Sure.� He replied.

�I said you wanted to be
treated just like any other member of staff. But you won�t share in the tronc.
You�ll be paid just the basic minimum wage.�

The tronc was the combined pot of service
charges and tips that boosted most catering staff�s earnings.

He indicated and turned into the
restaurant car park.

They had arrived.

&nbsp;

From that day onwards, Mart spent from 3
p.m. to 11 p.m. washing dishes; endless steel pans, pots, baking trays, thick
with oil, grease, fat and sauces. Joe, the kitchen commis, was uncouth,
short-tempered and ruthless in his demand that everything be spick and span,
scrubbed and washed by hand until the steel shone. The previous �plongeur� �
dishwasher � had resigned after just three days.

Mart was certainly treated no better than
any other member of the thirty strong staff of waiters and kitchen hands. In
fact, he was treated as the lowest of the low. And most of the staff were kids twenty years younger than he was. Alain, the
owner, was rarely around. He had delegated the kitchen to rough Joe, and the front of house to the smooth Maitre d�.

&nbsp;

Kelly was waiting up for him
the first night he got home. It was almost midnight. The last scheduled bus
left town at 23.15 and he�d only just caught it. She was sat with a drink and
her feet up, watching a chick flick.

�Tidy the kitchen.� was all
she said, engrossed in her movie.

She�d made a mess. He washed
up, wiped the surfaces, put stuff away.

He was still working half an
hour later when she appeared.

�I am going to have the shed
converted into a place for you to sleep. That way, if I want to go to bed
before you�re back, I can.�

�Can�t I just have a house key ?�

She smiled and fingered the
key hanging on a gold chain round her neck. It was the key to his chastity
belt.

�No, dear. Only one person has keys round here.�

&nbsp;

The next day was a Monday
and the dreadful, harsh routine started in earnest. Kelly woke him at 07.00 and
then she went back to her bed. She�d left him a written list of chores on the
kitchen table. At 09.30 he took up her breakfast, ran her a bath, then made up her bed. At 10.30 he jogged and exercised in
the field nearest the house while she watched him from a window. Then he
showered and shaved. From 11.30 he cooked, did more chores. At 13.00 he served
her lunch, then ate a cold salad himself. At 14.15 he
left to catch the bus to the restaurant. At around 23.45, he got home. Exhausted.

The back door was locked.
There was a note. Only five words.

�Go to the small shed�.

&nbsp;

There was no electricity. Just a half candle in a saucer and a box of matches. He lit
it in the moonlight. There was a thin mattress on the floor that he didn�t
recognise, and a sleeping bag he did; it was Barbie pink and only about four
foot in length. On the floor there was a chipped mug that they had used to keep
pencils in. His brush and tube of toothpaste stood in the mug. By the side stood a full bottle. It was labelled. �Today�s Brew !�.

&nbsp;

At 7 a.m., he was woken by a
shrill ringing. He found an alarm clock that he hadn�t noticed the night
before.

And a handwritten
list; �Garden Chores�.

There were two sheds. The small one and a larger one with gardening equipment in it.
He dressed in what he�d been wearing the night before and did over two hours of
early morning pruning, cutting, tidying. Then he fired up the mower and did the
main lawn. The day was going to be a hot one. The sky was clear blue and there
was no breeze.

Sometime later, he saw her
watching him from her bedroom window.

She waved. He grimaced, then gave an embarrassed wave back.

Was this really what he wanted ?

Sadly, yes it was.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Kelly waved down. It was
almost ten o�clock.

She watched him frown and
give her a little wave back. She stood in admiration as he continued mowing
neat lines on the grass. Her husband was such a talented man. Everything he
did, he did well. She chuckled. Well, almost everything !

And now his many talents would be put to
use for her benefit.

She turned back to the bed and smiled at
Alain.

Her lover.

Well, thank heavens she didn�t
actually love him. This whole thing wouldn�t have worked if she did.
That would have been much too complicated ! But the
hunky 28 year old Frenchman was no more interested in loving her than
she was him. The French understand affairs better than anybody else. This was
hot, sexual lust, that�s all. Passionate, naughty, romantic
even, but certainly not true love.

She opened the window. The
buzz of the lawnmower and scent of freshly cut grass invaded the room. She let
her robe fall open and walked slowly over to the bed.

He smiled sleepily up at
her. His handsome Gallic features, long black hair and morning shadow excited
her. He was only the second man she had ever slept with. She�d been a virgin
when she met Mart and faithful throughout two decades. She had a bit of
catching up to do !

He reached out to her and
pulled her to him.

She gasped as his hands
explored her, his lips on hers, then his mouth kissed
her throat, her chest, her stiffening nipples. Her robe fell off and she
moaned, taking his hard shaft in her hand, admiring its bulk. There�d been
nothing disappointing about Mart�s penis, but she had struck lucky with Alain.
To feel full again after motherhood and all this time was an awesome sensation.

Outside, the
lawnmower chuntered up and down in a steady rhythm.

Inside, she climbed on top
of Alain and hissed excitedly as he started to push up and into her in an
equally steady rhythm.

&nbsp;

Mart put the lawnmower into idle and
wiped the sweat off his brow. The sun was beating down and he had huge wet patches
under the arms of his shirt. He glanced up at Kelly�s open window. She�d gone. Probably to have her bath.

He�d had no breakfast yet.
The bottle labelled �Today�s Brew� stood in the shade. He could have drunk
water from the garden hose but he knew she wouldn�t approve. It was another
test he had to pass.

He unscrewed the top and
lifted the bottle to his lips. Moments before he tasted it, the stench hit him
and he gagged. But he fought through the reaction and glugged back several
mouthfuls. It was lukewarm and bitter and it left an after burn lingering in
the back of his throat. You could only say one thing for it.

It was fluid.

He put the top back on the
bottle and belched. A hint of acid and garlic repeated on him, making his eyes
water. Wearily, he put the mower back into gear and got back to work.

&nbsp;

Kelly bit her lip to stifle
her cry as she climaxed yet again. Multiple orgasms were a new one on her ! Then she heard the lawnmower start up again and
allowed herself to cry loudly; yesssssssssssssss.

It wasn�t that she didn�t
want Mart to know eventually. He�d find out soon enough. One of her ambitions
was to have affairs openly, not behind his back. But she was enjoying this too
much to share it yet. It had only started three weeks before. A lovely illicit
affair while she got the confidence to cum clean, so to speak.

Alain groaned beneath her
and she smiled, putting her finger to his lips.

She felt him thrust one final time and
then he came too. She let herself collapse like a wet rag onto his perspiring chest
and started giggling into the pillow.

&nbsp;

�Look !�
she shrieked at him. �That�s not straight.�

It was noon, and she had
taken a glass of iced lemonade into the garden.

Mart stared down at the
lawn. The stripes he had mown were almost perfect, except for an awkward area
by some rose bushes.

�I�m sorry.� He replied,
staring at the slight kink in the grass.

She shook her head, running
her fingers through her just-washed hair. Beyond the neat lawn and borders,
through a statuary arch, there was a secondary garden, run amok with trees,
wild flowers, overgrown bushes and an old vegetable patch.

And down a small path there
was a dense clump of �urtica dioica�.

�Let�s go for a wander.� She said,
leading the way, until they reached a rusted seat next to the nettle patch.

They stood by the fronds,
standing tall and still in the breezeless air. Urtica dioica is the European
stinging nettle. It grows up to 6ft tall and contains three chemicals; a histamine that stings the skin, acetylcholine that causes
burning, and serotonin that stimulates the other two chemicals to perform.

By September, the serotonin
has started to become less effective with the onset of Fall,
but in mid-August it is still at its most vigorous. As a result, the sting,
burning and itching are intense !

�Take off those sweaty
clothes.�

She sipped her drink as Mart
slowly removed his soaking shirt and other damp clothes, until he was standing
totally nude before her, except for his chastity tube.

The ice made a sucking sound
as she finished her glass of lemonade.

�Do you remember once when
Chantal was three of four and she stung herself badly ?�

He looked up into her eyes
and nodded silently.

�You said to her then she
had to be brave. Remember ?�

She had him now. Nervous as hell.

�I do.�

�I�d expect a forty two year
old man to be brave too, right ?�

He nodded again.

�So pluck one of those
nettles out with your bare hands.�

She watched him blink, then
step slowly towards the threatening fronds. He stretched out an arm and twisted
a stem between his thumb and index finger. It stood strong, unbroken, and she
saw him wince, biting his lip.

�Use your whole hand. Come
on � be brave.�

He curled his fingers round
the shoot and broke it in half. He was now holding a 3ft long, stinging cane in
his palm.

�Now, rub that all over your
front.� She said. �Legs, chest and, don�t forget er � you know where !�

Their eyes met in unspoken
combat. There was only one winner.

She watched him apply the
stick of green leaves with their serrated edges and silver hairs all over his front.
In seconds, his skin was bright red with tracks of welted, goose-bumped stings.
His green eyes became moist.

�Aw, diddums.� She teased.
�Make sure you cover your scrotum.�

�Atch � ow �� he moaned,
shaking his hand in pain. He was starting to move from one foot to the other as
the chemicals filled his bloodstream.

�Now wipe your bottom with
it.�

She wondered whether he�d obey. At any
moment she feared he might throw it to the ground in rebellion. It was a risk
she had to take. To find out just how far this whole thing
could go.

Remarkably, green eyes
narrowed in determination, he bent over and rubbed the remaining uncrumpled
leaves all over his anus and buttocks.

�Good boy.� She said, like
he was a begging dog. �Now stand to attention for half an hour while the
sensation dies down. That was an easy test. The next time we come out here will
be much harder !�

She settled down on the
rusted seat and watched him, arms by his side, legs straight, as he somehow
managed to resist scratching or soothing his blazing skin.

It seemed as if she could go
a lot further yet !

She raised her face to the
sun and shut her eyes, enjoying its heat. Fumbling with her fingers, she
unbuttoned her top, so that the rays could warm her skin.

And so that her husband could see what he
couldn�t touch.

&nbsp;

Early that evening, Mart was
in the back of the restaurant kitchen, scrubbing away at the pile of saucepans
and utensils when Alain appeared. The owner was a lazy sod. He seemed to be
one of those new type of �celebrity cooks� who think
that putting their name to a place and coming up with a menu constitutes being
a chef.

He spoke with Joe and
several other staff then looked over at Mart.

�Ola�

Mart nodded in response,
wiping his hands.

�Non
� don�t stop.� Alain said. �Keep drying.� His English was fluent but he spoke
with one of those annoying, clich� French accents.

Mart picked up a scouring
pad and a new pan with a stubborn treacly sauce stuck to the bottom.

Alain smiled and slapped him
on the back.

�Nice work, mon ami. I hope
you are enjoying your job here.�

Mart watched him walk away
with a supercilious sneer on his face.

Fucking frog.

&nbsp;

Later that evening, Kelly
drained her glass and pouted.

�Let�s go to bed.�

It was only ten thirty but
she felt horny again. She had gone from feeling hot about twice a month, to
being ready for sex twice a day. In fact, more than ready !
Embarrassingly, she�d even started masturbating herself again, something she�d
almost never done since her teens. This past week not even frequent sex with
Alain had been enough.

He gave her a Gallic shrug
and wicked smile. Pourquoi pas, eh ?

They got up from the table.
The kitchen was a complete tip from where he had cooked her dinner. She blew
out the candles. It wouldn�t take Sherlock Holmes to detect that it had been a
romantic dinner for two.

�I�ll just go and check the door.� He
said.

�No.� she shook her head.
�Leave it unlocked.�

It was time to move things
on. First, she picked up the white wine bottle that Alain had been using all
evening to empty his bladder. It was full and labelled �Today�s Brew� in her
writing. Then she took a sheet of paper from the sideboard. It was a message
she had prepared earlier.

�Pin this to the door for me
would you.�

&nbsp;

The bus was running late and it was after
midnight when Mart arrived home, fearing another night in the shed. The air was
clammy and warm and he still had several itchy mosquito bites from the night
she�d left the window open, although that day�s nettle rash had thankfully died
down.

He was relieved when he had
read the piece of paper pinned to the door.

&nbsp;

I
hope you had a fun evening, darling.

I�ve
had an exhausting day and

I�m
now a little worse for wear so I�ve turned in.

Tidy
up the kitchen and make sure you lock the back door.

You
can sleep in the guest room tonight as a treat

and
lie in until I wake you in the morning.

Sleep
tight, K

&nbsp;

He stared at the mess in the
kitchen. He�d just spent eight hours washing frigging pots and pans and she�d
left him a bunch more ! The central table had been
laid for two. There were the remains of candles, cheese plates and dirty
glasses, plus a couple of empty bottles of wine. On the counter, more used
plates were stacked by the sink for washing.

He frowned. It must have
been some �dinner a deux�.

He wondered which of her friends she�d entertained
and how she�d explained his own absence. Most of her close girlfriends still
lived in London and her local mates were pretty much all married. In the past
she and Mart had always socialised as a couple in the evenings.

He turned the hot tap on and
started clearing away. It would take him a half hour at least to make a proper
job of the disarray. But there was something much worse than yet more domestic
drudgery.

His dick and balls ached. He was
starting to feel very frustrated indeed.

&nbsp;

At 12.50, he trudged
upstairs. He paused for a split second outside her bedroom door. Silence.

He blew a silent kiss at the
wall and crept along to the guest room. She had thoughtfully put his toothbrush
and paste in the same chipped mug by the basin. He smiled. Only somebody who
cared, deep down, would have remembered to fetch them from the shed. The
inevitable bottle of today�s brew stood by them.

He squeezed toothpaste onto
his brush and turned the cold tap.

Nothing.

The hot tap.

Nothing.

He tried both the bath taps.

Nothing. Not a drop.

She must have had a plumber
disconnect this bathroom from the tank.

He shook his head in
reluctant admiration. Nasty.

With a shiver of distaste, he poured some
of her pee into the mug, and used it to swill out the toothpaste from his
mouth.

&nbsp;

He was still asleep at half
past eight when Kelly silently slipped into the guest room. She watched his
face, and his chest rising and falling. A stab of tenderness pricked her
conscience. She hoped he was getting as much out of all this as she was !

She sat on the bed and he stirred,
opening his green eyes.

�Shhh.� She said. �Put
these in. I want to concentrate your senses.�

They were earplugs. Wedges of rubbery foam that cut out all sound. He made a
face as he corked first one, then the other, into his ears.

�Now let�s put this on.�

It was a PVC hood. She�d
bought it online with the chastity devices.

He obediently held his head
still while she pulled the hood over him. It covered everything down to his
neckline except for his nostrils and mouth. She zipped it shut at the back and
clipped it tight.

She smiled at his
appearance.

�Can you hear me ?� she asked in her normal tone of voice.

He sat up, motionless, deaf.

She pushed him back down
onto the sheet and stretched out his limbs gently, using the wrist and ankle
cuffs to spread eagle him on the bed.

Then she walked out of the
room.

&nbsp;

She brewed a pot of strong
coffee and took a tray of grapefruit juice and pastries up to Alain. After they
had eaten, he slid his hand over her plump breast and licked her nipple until
it hardened.

She opened her thighs to receive him. She
was loose and soiled from the previous night and he penetrated her easily,
despite his girth. She bit his shoulder and pushed her hips up to meet him.

It felt sooo goood. She was
becoming a nymphomaniac !

She looked up at him and
smiled.

It was true. At this moment,
she only really had eyes for the man in her bed. But just as she had hoped, a
bit in the back of her brain was still thinking of the man in the guest room
bed. Weird as it sounds, she was fucking one, but making love to the other ! That was the only way this whole fucking thing could
work.

And, for once, she didn�t
climax. Alain did his usual skilful stuff but the triggers didn�t fire and she
was happy when he quickly lost it and filled her with urgent, spurting thrusts.

Talk about creaming the fish
pie !

&nbsp;

Once Alain had dressed and
left the house, she sat on the toilet and peered between her legs as the
thickest part of his load drooled from her labia into the pan. Oh well, there
would be other times for Mart to savour a full helping. This time she would
nevertheless be soaking and spicy.

The coffee had done its stuff and she
felt her guts churn. She picked up an interiors magazine and flicked through it
while she emptied her bowels. Then she wiped her bottom with a single piece of
tissue. She stared at it and then threw it in the pan. With a shrug, she used
one more sheet of tissue. She looked at it and smiled. That was enough.

Mart�s senses would be overwhelmed,
scrambled and confused.

Just how she wanted
him.

&nbsp;

He lay in the dark. He was
stretched out fully but not uncomfortably. It must have been an hour since she
left him like this. He couldn�t see or hear. There was nothing to smell or say
or feel. All his energies were focussed on his sixth sense.

And suddenly he sensed
somebody in the room with him.

Kelly.

His body dipped with the
mattress as she clambered onto the bed. He sensed her fingers straightening the
sheet on which he lay and then another shift in the mattress as she manoeuvred
herself into position. Her skin brushed his ears and he realised she was sat
astride his head, facing his feet.

A solitary wet finger brushed up the
inside of his right thigh to the chastity cock-cage he was wearing. Her hands
teased his tight scrotum.

He was suddenly aware how
strong his sense of touch and smell were, now he was
locked in the hood. He realised how sharply Kelly stank. He could distinguish a
pungent blend. Maybe she had passed gas and he hadn�t heard her
? She exuded a ripe scent of sexuality too. He realised how excited this
whole scene must have got her.

Her soft hairs and hot flesh
tickled his eyelashes and nose and he knew she was sitting down on his face.
But instead of supporting her weight, he realised she had sunk right down,
utterly enveloping his nostrils and mouth. He couldn�t breathe. He panicked.

Mmpphhff � he tried to
speak.

Her nails dug into his
thighs and raked his skin.

Somehow he guessed what she
wanted and stuck his tongue out as far as he could. It tasted coppery and he
drove it up into her bottom. Almost immediately, he felt her taking some of her
weight and he was able to suck in a lungful of air.

Her skin felt incredibly
slippery against his chin. She was sodden. He gasped as what felt like a wet
fish slapped him in the mouth.

For the first
time he realised something.

&nbsp;

Kelly sat like a bucking bronco and drove
herself to a manic climax. She was owed one after sex with Alain hadn�t got her
off. She was using her left arm to brace herself and her right hand to strum
her clit, while sliding her sopping gusset all along Mart�s face. She kept
peering down and snatching glances at the glistening slime oozing out of her.

She also enjoyed looking at
his enclosed dick. Looking but ignoring.

How many of their early years she�d
spent putting the priority on him, on his satisfaction. Worrying that if she
didn�t compare with his couple of previous girlfriends he might dump her.
Sucking him until her jaw ached. Putting out night after night when she wasn�t
in the mood. Even faking orgasms to get his humping weight
off her.

Well now it was her turn to
get satisfaction, his turn to worry about her boyfriends. His
turn to get jaw ache. Above all, his turn to experience the frustration
and long waits between sexual fulfilment.

Oh, she loved him alright. Loads. But the sex ? She could
finally grade him now. Er � give the lad a C minus,
please.

&nbsp;

She left him tied there,
while she took a long and luxurious shower.

It was time. The cuckolding
bit was not the sole purpose of all this. Heck, it wasn�t even the main purpose.
But it was an essential stage to be got through. Soon she�d be able to get to the
point.

She took out a sheet of
their expensive cream stationery and her fountain pen. She wrote him a very
short note and put it in a matching envelope, with an instruction for him not
to open it until he was on the bus and almost at work.

It would be best to give him
eight hours of hard labour at the restaurant �sink� in order for the reality to
�sink� in !

She smiled to herself. The
note contained just five more words.

�Yes, dear. It has happened !�

&nbsp;

Part Three: September

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�Please, Ma�am. May I go to the
toilet ?�

&nbsp;

Kelly glanced up from her
magazine. Then she carried on reading. She could sense Mart standing there, in
his new lycra gardening top
and pleated skirt.

�Have you finished everything ?� she asked finally, not looking up.

�Yes.�

She sighed. �And you are one
hundred percent certain I�ll be satisfied ?�

He hesitated. �I think so.�

�You think so ?� She looked up. �Well go and make absolutely sure. And
in an hour�s time we�ll see about you going to the toilet.�

He blinked and nodded. �Yes
Ma�am. Thank you, Ma�am.�

&nbsp;

In the 1960s, an Austrian
psychologist named Walter Mischel conducted the
�Marshmallow Test� on 4-year-old children; they were given a marshmallow and
told they could eat it at any time. But if they were able to resist temptation
and not touch it for 15 minutes, they could then have two marshmallows instead.
Some simply �grabbed� their marshmallow and ate it. Others managed to exercise
enough �self control� to wait fifteen minutes and earn a second one.
Interestingly, longitudinal research via follow up studies showed that the
�grabbers� later suffered low self esteem and grew up to be envious, stubborn
and easily upset. Meanwhile the �self controllers� became competent, trustworthy,
dependable and successful. The latter group on average scored 210 points higher
on their SATs !

&nbsp;

Kelly had embarked on an
intense program of training Mart in �self control�. He hadn�t had a drink of
alcohol since the July evening that their new relationship began. His current
diet was strict, healthy but meagre, and generally unappetising; his weight and
body fat levels were measured three times a week to manage them downwards; his
exercise regime was steadily being cranked up in intensity.

Lately, she had commenced
teaching him to rein in his visits to the toilet and control his bladder and
bowel movements. There were so many interesting ways that a grown man could
have his self esteem challenged when it came to use of the toilet.

Watching TV, reading
newspapers, particularly sports gossip, viewing any sort of pornography, eating
ice cream and candies, kicking back and relaxing; all these and more became
things to be restricted, rationed or prohibited altogether.

Above all,
orgasms. The chastity devices ensured Mart�s physical obedience. But Kelly
wanted to modify his behaviour and guarantee his mental submission too. She
wanted him to get to the stage where he voluntarily focussed entirely on her.
Where he would go weeks, even months, without thinking of gratifying his own
base urges. Only her wishes.

Entirely through self
control.

Life for Mart had become one
big marshmallow !

&nbsp;

That night he returned from
working at the restaurant had been the most important of all.

Mart knew.

The note had contained just
five words. �Yes, dear. It has happened.�

She might as well have
written five pages. No further words were necessary. He knew the truth; that he
had become a cuckold. He didn�t know when, how or who, but she had taken that
vital step which turned their D/s relationship from a private two-person
Mistress and slave marriage to something else entirely.

He�d asked for it though. He
deserved everything he had coming to him. No limits. He�d mentioned hot wives,
and wife watching, and cuckolding enough times to her over the years.

And now his fantasy was her
reality.

That night there�d been a
tense atmosphere when he returned. She was up waiting for him at almost
midnight. Her hair was dishevelled and she was sipping a brandy in her dressing
gown. The key to his CB hung round her neck.

�Come up to bed.� was all
she said. 

He followed her into her
bedroom. She motioned for him to strip off.

While he undressed, she lay
down on the double bed. It was unmade, covers on the floor, sheets askew. She
parted her robe.

�Now that you know what you�re
licking, I want you to do it again.�

He stood by the bed and she
turned the key in his padlock. She was very matter-of-fact, like this was
something to be got through, to be negotiated like a tricky driving manoeuvre,
before reaching the open road ahead.

�And I want to see you hard
while you do it.�

He removed his Gerecke device and climbed onto the bed and hunkered down
between her thighs.

She was freshly creamed. Her
neatly trimmed pubic triangle was matted and damp, emitting that slightly
rancid, post-sex aroma.

�That�s less than an hour
old.�

Her fingers entwined in his hair, not
roughly, but firmly.

He�d dreamed of this moment. But
seeing her now, he realised that reality and fantasy were always going to be
different things. This was the virgin he had met and married all those years
ago. The faithful wife and mother. Crammed full with
the spunk of another man. He suspected she�d betrayed him before she had
accepted �his offer�. She had been unfaithful. But could he really blame her ? One measly cock � his � her whole life
? She deserved so much more; quality and quantity. And what of himself ? He�d fantasised, jerked off, cruised websites,
hoping he�d join the stats as just one more cuckold. And now, at last, he had.
Yes, he felt disgust at what he was about to do. Another man�s come was
emerging from his wife�s slit like a slug from under a rose bush. Yes, he felt
jealous, confronted by the undeniable liquid evidence of her straying. But
above all he felt excitement twang in both his dick and his head; in his guts
and in his soul.

There would be no turning back.

This was part of his future.

She looked so beautiful, lying there. Beautiful and wanton. Her tousled hair spread out on the
pillow, her long limbs relaxed, knees askew, her full breasts in good shape
despite motherhood and her 38 years. Her lipstick and mascara were not fresh
but still neat, lips pursed sexily apart. 

Slowly, he stuck out his
tongue and lapped at her swollen labia. In spite of everything, he could feel
an instant hardening in his uncaged groin.

�Mmm
�� she exhaled. �Good boy. This is the way it�s going to be from now on, Mart.
I don�t want my sex life to come between us. On the contrary, I may want you to
play a big part in my sex life again � just not in the old way.�

She opened her thighs as
wide was she could, squeezing her stomach muscles. He started nudging his face
into her more enthusiastically.

It was suddenly like a new
drug to him; consuming, dangerous, addictive, hallucinogenic. He could picture
a whale�s mouth opening wide and sucking him and a million psychedelic
cartoon-like tadpoles into its gullet.

�He was here.� He heard her murmuring
softly. �In this bed, our bed, fucking me. Do you want
to know who he is ?�

There was a deafening silence.
Then he managed to conjure up a simple �mmm� sound. Did
he ?

�Was that a yes ?� she giggled. �Well I�m not ready to tell you yet. But
I can tell you that he�s younger, fitter, bigger and, yes, a better lover than
you Mart. Not a better man, but a better lover. I cum easily
with him. And often. And with just his dick,
Mart, not fingers, like it used to be with you.�

She hauled his face up so
they were looking at each other.

�Show me yours.�

He sat up so that she could
look at his jutting, frustrated erection. He knew he wasn�t small. But in no
way did he consider himself large. His was a standard size dick; average,
moderate, mediocre, medium-sized, premium economy, super-coach. All those words
designed to make the guy in the middle of the plane feel as if he�s in first
class. When he isn�t.

�My ! We are
excited by all this, aren�t we ? Go on then. Put it in
me.�

With a whimper of
excitement, he mounted his wife. His newly toned body insinuated itself against
hers until they were touching noses.

He felt proud. He�d lost ten
pounds, built up muscles and honed his shape back to how it had been more than
a decade earlier.

And yet she had still found
someone fitter and stronger.

�Sloppy seconds.� She whispered
into his ear. �That�s what you cucks call it, right ? How does that feel, my love, good
?�

He kissed her neck. �Th � thank you � so � mmm � good.�

�Don�t you dare come, Mart.
Self control ! But you can try and make me come. Just
like my lover did right here an hour ago.�

He took his weight on his
elbows and began thrusting, first slowly, then building a faster rhythm. She
stared intently into his eyes without speaking.

She felt so wet, so loose,
so � unimpressed.

�Ngh � ngh � ngh
�� he pistoned. �Is � that � okay ?�

She smiled, with a shrug. �Okay ? Er � yes. It�s okay.�

�Might you c � come ?�

She shook her head. �No,
Mart. Not even if you kept this up for hours. You miss the point.� She reached
and stroked his cheek kindly. �But you can learn. We�ll find ourselves a
teacher for you. And it is nice to have you inside me again briefly. To feel close to you.�

He stopped pumping,
disappointed, and pushed up on his arms.

�Am � am I that, you know � bad ?�

She pushed him off her, so
his erection slipped out.

�Put it this way. You�re
lucky I didn�t know how � ordinary you were until recently. Now, go and take a
cold shower. If I don�t get to cum, then you certainly don�t. So
I want to get that thing locked up again.�

&nbsp;

The next morning, he held a plastic
funnel over an empty wine bottle for her, while she sprayed out her morning
bladder-full. It was dark, reddish gold, aromatic. He put the stopper in the
top and saw how cloudy the contents were, with little bits of crusty sediment
floating in her urine.

�I adore beetroot but not
what it does to your insides.� She chuckled.

As if you care, he thought, surprising
himself at the stab of resentment he felt. After all, whose fault is this,
Mart; yours or Kelly�s ? It was probably the
frustration of his unused testosterone making him tetchy.

He labelled it with the date
and put it down in the musty cellar. There it would fester for a week or so
before being brought out to accompany his lunch, while she sipped a chilled
Pinot Grigio.

�You always did like a nice pink champagne.� Kelly added, beaming.

He spent the morning doing house
and garden chores, desperate to use the toilet. It grew increasingly
uncomfortable, and he had to cross his legs and deep breathe several times to
prevent an accident; self control !

&nbsp;

�Please, Ma�am. May I go to the
toilet ?� he asked her a third time.

He waited as she took
another sip of her iced coffee and then she shrugged. They were on the terrace
overlooking the lawn.

�Remove those.�

He pulled the baby blue lycra gardening top over his head
and unzipped the pleated, frilly skirt she�d made him put on that morning. He
was no transvestite and he knew that Kelly got no real kick from feminising him
either. It was just another test, designed to push both their frontiers.

�Squat down over that.�

She was pointing to a tub
with geraniums and lobelia spilling out of it. He carefully planted his feet on
either side and crouched. The flower heads tickled his inner thighs and bottom.

�Okay. Hurry up and pee.�

He had been controlling himself so long that it took a few
moments to relax his grip on his bladder. But eventually, at last, it came.

It felt so
goooood.

He was
wearing a Gerecke �twister� chastity tube. Made of
best German steel, it was a totally secure, but light, see-thru cage for his
penis that was so far wearable 24/7. She had used a depilation cream to remove
every pubic hair from his waistline round to his anus and also applied Vaseline
grease daily to prevent chafing.

Inevitably
urine splashed onto his groin, legs and feet but most landed in the tub.

Eventually,
he opened his eyes and saw her watching him with an amused expression.

�Finished ?�

He nodded.
�Thank you, Ma�am. Er � ?�

She raised an
eyebrow.

�Ma�am. I need to � you know � do the
other kind as well.�

She tut-tutted.

�Honestly, you�re always wanting something. Can I do this
? Can I have a piss ? Can I take a dump ? How high must I jump ?
Whatever next ? You�ll be asking me if you can have an
orgasm soon !�

Oh, yes pleeeaaase.

�I�m sorry
Ma�am. It�s just ��

�No !� she shouted, suddenly fierce.

�I won�t have
your foul waste polluting anywhere on my property. You can wait until you get
to work and go there !�

He hung his
head in obedience.

�Now, let�s
inspect how well you�ve done your chores.�

&nbsp;

She found
several infractions. Worst of which was a layer of grimy dust missed underneath
the piping behind the toilet in the basement lavatory.

�Bend over
and clutch your ankles.�

They had come
back out onto the terrace. It was not overlooked but, nevertheless, there is
something about bdsm activity outdoors that heightens
a sub�s feelings of vulnerability.

He felt her
hand on his lower spine, adjusting his position to her liking. She had a way of
handling him now, like a piece of meat. He gripped his ankles as sweat trickled
from his forehead onto the stone tiled floor. His buttocks were stretched tight
and his anal crack felt open to the fresh air.

�I don�t get
a kick out of thrashing you, Mart.�

Her voice
was scolding, firm; like she used to talk to Chantal when she was growing up.

�But when I
ask for jobs to be done, I expect them to be done properly. This isn�t some
fucking game ! Is that understood ?�

�Yes, Ma�am.� He was shocked by
her use of the word �fucking�. She rarely used swear words.

�So why
didn�t you do them to my hundred percent satisfaction ?�

�I�m sorry. Ma�am.�

�Sorry ? Hmm � you soon will be.�

He heard her
swishing the bamboo through the air in a couple of practice strokes. It was a
standard garden cane but it made an evil �whooosh�.

�Nggh.� He grunted in pain at
the first blaze of fire across his bottom.

A second.

A third.

Please no more.
He dug his fingernails into the skin of his legs and ground his teeth together.
Fuck this. This wasn�t what he wanted.

A fourth
stroke, the hardest of all, slashed his flesh.

Unable to
take any more, Mart stood up, rubbing his buttocks.

Kelly�s eyes
shone at him with yellow specks of anger.

�What do you mean
by standing up ?� she screamed.

Suddenly he
realised what he�d done. He stared at her open-mouthed.

�You �� she
stammered with rage, �� pathetic wimp ! You don�t want
to be my slave at all. Full time you said ! No limits
you said ! Blah � blah � blah.
Well, too late Mart. It�s that � or those divorce papers you�ve already signed.
Which is it ?�

�I�m sorry.
Please. I ��. He dropped to his knees. �It�s just it
hurt so much. But you�re right. I said no limits. Please forgive me.�

She stared
down at him, anger slowly dissipating, her breathing gradually returning to
normal.

�I know it�s
hard, Mart. It�s meant to be. I can�t do this any other way. It�s my rules or
not at all.� She pouted in a half-grin, half-sad expression. �I warned you that
you might regret it. But there�s no going back now.�

He stared
down at the floor in surrender.

She was
right. You can�t put the genie back in the bottle.

�Good.� Her
voice was lighter again. �Now, where were we ? At four,
I think. But I�m not sure, so we�d better start again.�

&nbsp;

At just after two o�clock,
he set off for the restaurant. He watched her briefly standing on the front
step as he left, before she turned and shut the door. He wondered what she had
planned for herself over the next ten hours or so. He realised that she really
could do exactly as she liked. Not just without hassle but with a clean
conscience too.

He sat in the back row of
the bus and prayed he could make it the whole way. His buttocks felt sore against
the hard seat but his desperate need to void his bowels was a bigger problem.

At one stage, he unavoidably
passed wind and had to keep a straight face while his foul aroma filled the
bus. A little boy two rows ahead commented to his mother about the horrible
pong.

Eventually he made it, and
was leaving the seedy staff toilet in the basement, when Joe, the kitchen commis, cornered him.

�Phew. That�s a stink you�ve
left in there.�

�Sorry.� He mumbled.

�You washed your hands ?�

�Yes, of course.�

�Well you can dirty them
again. I want you to give this shithole a thorough
cleaning. Scrub the pan, the floor, behind the piping, everywhere. Got that ?�

Twenty minutes later, Joe
was back to inspect. He lifted the lavatory seat, bent down behind the
plumbing, ran his finger under the basin rim.

�Okay.� Joe held out a brown
envelope. �Open it.�

Mart fumbled it open and
found his first payslip; four weeks of minimum wage at �5.05 per hour. A measly
forty pounds a day, or �1,311 for the calendar month. Before tax. By the time the Revenue had taken their slice
his take home pay was just over eight hundred quid, for working 7 long days a week !

Smiling at Mart�s shocked
expression, Joe held out a waiter�s uniform. �Change into these. Tonight
Guillaume is ill. You can take his place waiting tables.�

It was the first time that
Mart had been allowed anywhere but the kitchen sink. The Maitre d� gave him a
crash course in serving etiquette. He learned which
side to serve, how to clear plates, how to stack them along his arm.

By 8.00 p.m., the restaurant
was almost full. It was known as the best place in the area. Most of the tables
were small, for two to four diners, with just a couple of round ones for
parties of six or eight. The atmosphere was romantic, with low lighting, and
little candles on each table.

Mart was assisting by
serving vegetables, pouring water and wine and clearing plates. The Maitre d�
and another senior waiter took all the orders.

Shortly after eight, Alain,
the proprietor arrived. He stood at the small bar with a glass of champagne
surveying business. Mart nodded hello as he scurried by with a stack of dishes
but Alain looked straight through him.

Five minutes later, Mart
gasped with shock.

Kelly walked into the
restaurant.

She had never been to visit
him at work since the private meeting with Alain on his first day. She looked
sensational, in a figure hugging dress he�d never seen before. The gold chain
hung round her neck.

Alain walked over to greet
her and they pecked each other on the cheek. Mart watched him lead her over to
a corner table and hold out her chair for her to sit down. The Maitre d�
hovered around them.

�Psst.�

Mart realised a senior
waiter was hissing at him to stop dawdling and get on with his job. He tore his
eyes away and went into the kitchens.

�I see Alain�s got his
mistress in tonight.� Somebody was saying.

�Nice looking lady.� Another
person replied, brushing past Mart.

�I hear she�s married.� He
heard a third voice say.

�Ze
best fucks all are.� Said a French sous-chef,
passing Mart two dishes for Table 11. �Zeir
husbands cannot cope.� He added, winking at Mart.

He spent the next thirty minutes in a
daze. Rushing to and from the kitchen, serving, trying his
best not to gawp at his wife with Alain, and to ignore the ribald conversation
in the kitchen. It was evident the staff didn�t know that Kelly was his
wife.

�Take these vegetables to
Table One.� He was told.

He followed the senior
waiter over to Kelly and Alain�s table. She had ordered the sole and he was
having lamb. Then Mart came forward with the peas and spinach.

Her brown eyes rested
briefly on Mart, scrutinizing, but not acknowledging him.

Meanwhile, Alain reached
across the table and put his hand on hers, telling her some joke. Her face
sparkled with excitement in the candlelight as she listened. 

She laughed at the punchline, leaning to one side as Mart served her.

Then Kelly patted Alain�s
hand.

He clearly heard her say
five words.

�So, will you teach him ?� she asked.

&nbsp;

It was midnight when Kelly
heard Mart arrive.

She and Alain had left the
restaurant at ten thirty and driven home. He fixed them both nightcaps while
she put on an album of sexy jazz songs, one of a stack she�d purchased to
replace all Mart�s old rock CDs that she�d given to a charity shop.

They were slow dancing
together in the living room when Mart peered round the door. She gestured to
him over Alain�s shoulder.

�Take your clothes off.� She
said over the music.

They carried on dancing and
kissing while Mart undressed. She smiled at his embarrassment until he stood
totally naked. Then she broke away and sat down, patting the sofa for Alain to
sit behind her. She lowered the music volume right down.

�So, Mart. As you will have
gathered, Alain is giving me the sex I deserve, until you learn to do it
properly. Or rather, � if you learn to do it properly. Tell me, Mart,
what did you used to call your teachers at school ?�

�Er
� �Sir�.�

�And what are you going to
call your new teacher now ?�

�Sir.�

�Correct. Come and stand
here.�

She waited until he was in
front of them, in nothing but the device caging his penis. Alain smiled at her,
obviously not at all phased by the scene.

Just a she hoped, he was
striking just the right balance so far. She wanted a dominant man, who could
play the part convincingly, enjoying himself, but not a guy who would try to
take over. This was her game, not his.

�So, I am to be his sex
teacher, yes ?� Alain said, in his French accent. �In how to satisfy his wife.�

�Mais
oui.� She replied. �Say please.�

�Er
� please �� Mart paused, �� would you be my t � teacher.�

�And I think you should
offer to pay Alain some school fees.�

�H � how much ?�

Alain shrugged.

�How about eight hundred
pounds ?� Kelly suggested.

Of course, she knew that was
almost the exact amount that Mart�s labours in the kitchen had earned him for a
whole month ! All to be handed back to Alain. Although, of course, eventually
the full amount would actually end up in her own pocket.

Mart looked back from one to the other of
them sheepishly.

She knew that he�d realised
she�d calculated the amount for maximum effect. Not that it was the money
itself. She had several million, all now in her sole name. But it was still a
currency between them. A month�s truly hard work equated to � whatever she now
had in store for him.

�Yes, Sir. I agree to the
fee.�

Alain nodded. �It will be a
hard course for you, I think.�

�Yes, Sir.�

�So we must begin by seeing
at what level you are at now ?�

Kelly smiled as Alain rose
and went to the cloak cupboard in the hall. He returned carrying a woman.

A full size, pink, plastic
blow-up doll !

Kelly pulled the gold chain
over her neck, lifting the key from her cleavage, and leaned forward and
unlocked Mart�s Gerecke.

Alain laid the doll she�d
purchased face up on the floor. She watched him pause to admire the red and
yellowing bruises on Mart�s backside, before sitting down.

�Okay, mon
ami, first we must give your girlfriend a name. Tell
me, what should we call her ?�

Mart shook his head. �I
don�t know.�

�Aw, monsieur come on ! You
will be very close to this woman; chatting her up, dating her, seducing her,
making love. You must have a name for her.�

�What about Martina ?� Kelly
suggested.

�Good idea.� Alain said.
�Say hello to Martina.�

�H � hello, M � Martina.�
Mart mumbled.

�Oh dear. Not like that. You
must be self assured when speaking to a woman. Now, again, boldly. With charm.
Say hello to Martina.�

�Hello Martina.�

�Better.�

&nbsp;

For five minutes, she and
Alain tormented Mart with requests and instructions for humiliating dialogue.
Then they made him kneel between Martina�s plastic thighs and ask her if he
could start by licking her out.

�Umm �� Kelly
replied, in a high-pitched squeak, imitating Martina.

Mart shifted lower and began
lapping at the entrance of the fake vagina.

She tongue-kissed Alain while they
watched Mart, and she reached down to unzip the Frenchman�s trousers, releasing
his superb manhood.

�Now, lick her behind.�

They watched Mart lift the
doll by the hips and bury his tongue in its imitation anus. Meanwhile, she
began slurping noisily on Alain�s real erection, loud enough so Mart would
definitely hear.

Way back when, in their early days,
Kelly had enjoyed giving head. She�d even tried swallowing a couple of times
before she got Mart up the aisle. But it had been a long old time since she�d given
him any more than a cursory lick. Many years. And she hadn�t realised how much
she�d missed it in a strange sort of way. It made her feel young, raunchy. And
she liked the control she had when she did it. But most of all, it was the
trade off. The quid pro quo. You give me exciting sex and I�ll give it you
back. Alain�s cock deserved its reward. So did her puss. Now she liked giving
it to Alain and receiving it from Mart.

�Now, you may start to fuck
Martina.� He said in his sexy French accent.

In spite of, or probably
because of, his humiliation, she could see that Mart was excited now. He
clambered up the doll and plunged into its vagina.

She smiled encouragingly.

After a few seconds, Mart
paused, then gasped.

Earlier, she had lined the
inner recess of the doll�s vagina with a generous dollop of Deep Heat, a muscle
unguent similar to Ben Gay, which burned sensitive skin. She gave him her best
smirk.

He gasped again and looked
up at them uncertainly. His face was turning bright red and he started breathing
in short, fast wheezes.

�Zere
is a problem ?� Alain asked, with his hand gently guiding Kelly�s head.

�It�s ��

�Make love, boy ! In � out �
in � out � in ��

Mart tried desperately to
obey, plunging, groaning and gasping.

�Is that the best you can do
? Look, Martina isn�t reacting at all !�

�So, you can � mmm � shee � my � pwoblem �� Kelly mumbled with her lips sliding sensuously
along Alain�s dick.

�I can see he is useless.
Get out at once !� Alain barked.

Mart pushed himself up into
a kneeling position. His penis quivered, throbbing and hot, and � best of all �
deflating. There�s a point at which discomfort ceases to be erotic. That
point had obviously been reached.

She watched him grimace and
try to rub the glistening gel from his shaft.

�Stand up !� she said,
pulling her lips from Alain�s equally throbbing and hot, but still inflating
penis. �To attention. Hands behind your back.�

�It is time for a demonstration !� said
the teacher.

&nbsp;

Mart sat in a hard-backed
oak chair, his wrists tied to the arms and his ankles fastened to the chair
legs. It was past one a.m. but the lights were still bright in what had once
been �their� bedroom.

He watched in awe as his
wife shrieked in ecstatic climax again. Alain was now pounding her from behind
in the doggy position, both of them seemingly oblivious to Mart�s presence.

He would have scratched his
head if he could. There was nothing he could discern that Alain was doing any
differently to how Mart had tried. Sure, like a dancer, he moved more
confidently and rhythmically than Mart�s clumsy attempts. Nevertheless, he
really couldn�t see any reason why Kelly was going off like a box of fireworks.

He had been put firmly in his place.

Still at least he had five simple words
to comfort him.

�Things can only get
better�.

&nbsp;

But Mart had no idea how
wrong he was.

&nbsp;

FIVE WORDS

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Part Four: October

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It wasn�t promiscuity that
drove Kelly in search of new men.

&nbsp;

Of course, we all lie to
ourselves. Sometimes we don�t even know we�re doing it. We imagine we�re being
entirely truthful in what we tell ourselves about something but hey, deep down,
well �

Like, how much do you drink
a day ? Just one glass of wine ?
A single chilled beer ? One vodka
and tonic. ? Yeah, sure. Or how many hours of
TV do you watch a week ? Or how many cigarettes do you
smoke ? How often do you jerk off ?
Really ? The honest truth ?
Have you counted ?

Or take a more subtle
question. You ever play that game, I think it was called �Scruples�
? Like, if you found a fifty buck note on the sidewalk, would you (a)
try to find the owner, or (b) just quietly pocket it ?
You know how many people say they�d look for the person who�d dropped it ? About 95%.

And you know the real
percentage, right ?

Much, much lower.

&nbsp;

I�m telling you this so that
you know the truth about Kelly. Those of you interested in her thought
processes mustn�t expect perfection. She�s spent two decades thinking like a
responsible wife and mom. Suddenly her life has turned upside down. She�s no
fool and she isn�t consciously going to try to fool herself � or you � but, as
I said, we all lie to ourselves. She�s no better, no worse, than you or any one
of us.

&nbsp;

She had hugely enjoyed her
first three months of exciting new cock. In raw sex terms, she was having the
best time of her life. In one sense, Alain was as good as it gets; his dick in
her puss and Matt�s tongue in her ass was a combination that she could imagine
herself enjoying for a long, long time.

But in another way, her
Frenchman had opened her eyes � and thighs � to the thrill of what this modern
world of ours offers a hot wife.

And yet, it wasn�t
promiscuity, or even sex, that made her � how shall we
put it � �available�, at all. It was love. Her relationship with Alain had soon
reached the point where it either had to wither. Or deepen. And whilst the
fantasy of him moving in permanently with her, relegating Mart to a life in the
basement was sexually arousing, it wasn�t what she wanted most of the time. She
still loved her husband.

And that was the truth.

&nbsp;

Kelly had never found black
men attractive. It wasn�t that she considered them unattractive either, but
with the exception of a few music and movie stars, the ones she�d seen or met
in her life weren�t her type.

Until James.

He was educated, middle
class, 35, single, and damned gorgeous. Just as it had with Alain, it started
out as an illicit affair. She met him one afternoon at the local tennis club
where she had started playing in a ladies doubles twice a week to pass some of
her free time.

After she succumbed to his
charms, she began taking on two cocks virtually one after the other, several
times a week; Alain in the afternoons, and James in the evenings, or vice
versa.

She had three weeks of the
most incredible sex and orgasms of her life. But it started to become too
much of a good thing ! And it wasn�t only her sore
pussy that gave her concern. It was the deceit.

Neither Alain, nor Mart, had
a clue what was going on.

&nbsp;

Sexually, Mart was very much
relegated to third place. As the Autumn leaves changed
colour and the nights closed in, her husband�s life was dominated by his relentless
drudgery at home and at work. He seemed gradually to be coming to terms with
the build up of testosterone in his frustrated bloodstream. He at last appeared
to accept that analingus and massage were simply
duties in themselves and not some means to try to persuade her that he merited
release. Anyway, for the moment, she almost never used him � even orally - for
her own sexual relief. James and Alain were too hot, horny and hung for her to
bother with her husband�s cunnilingus, however keen. The fact that she
virtually denied Mart any type of access to her vagina had become an
implicit fact of their lifestyle.

&nbsp;

One evening, she came clean
� so to speak.

Actually, come to think of
it, she was not clean, but rather dirty. Mart arrived home a little before
midnight. She had just retired to her bedroom and was brushing her teeth when
she heard him trudging up the stairs to the guest room.

�Mart !�
she called out.

There was a knock on her
door.

�Enter.�

He looked tired, with dark
rings under his eyes. She�d finally let him move back into the house for the
winter. He hadn�t been sleeping well in the shed. He was also seventeen pounds
lighter than he had been in July.

�Have a good evening ?� she enquired.

He shrugged. �Busy. The
restaurant was full.�

She smiled. �Tell me. Do you
enjoy your new career ?�

His green eyes widened. �Er � the truth ?�

�Yes. The
truth.�

�I hate it. I know it�s your
choice and I accept that better now. I�ll do whatever work I�m told. But � I do
hate it.�

What a delicious thought.

�Then we must choose your
next job very carefully.�

He stared at her. 

She walked through to her ensuite bathroom and he followed.

�Yes. I have decided that
you need a new challenge.� She continued. �Nearer to home.�

His expression brightened
and she smiled inwardly.

�You like that
?�

�Yes. That sounds great.�

There was a pause while she
opened her robe and sat down on the toilet.

�How long since you came, Mart ?�

�Twenty seven days.�

�Oh � is that all ?�

He looked at the bathroom
floor. �Yes.�

She suddenly chuckled. Actually
she remembered it well. It had been another �ruined orgasm�, where she had
masturbated him to the point of ejaculation and then let go. She�d timed it
perfectly. She had pulled her hand away a couple of seconds earlier than the
previous time and watched his cock bob in the air, as nothing spurted out. He
whimpered as very slowly his semen had drooled from the tip. Gradually his
erection softened while he stood still and she mixed herself a cocktail,
returning to see a puddle on the floor between his feet. She loved the sense of
control but, above all, she loved the game. It amused her greatly to pit her
wits against him.

�Come here.� Her tone was
soft, beckoning. �Kneel.�

He knelt between her open
knees, looking up at her.

She sighed and swept her
robe fully apart, so the two parts hung down each side of the toilet. She too
had lost weight; a couple of pounds. Though not from dieting but from a surfeit
of exercise ! She hadn�t bathed in twenty four hours
and a pungent fishy odour wafted up as she parted her legs wider.

�You may kiss me.�

Mart�s nostrils twitched and
his lips opened, revealing his pink tongue.

She shut her eyes and
settled back.

&nbsp;

She had always been funny
about the lavatory. Not peeing. That was fine. But pooing
had embarrassed her as long as she remembered. She detested public restrooms. Those lines of stalls with ladies only a thin partition away
from each other. So undignified ! The
sounds of defecation. Not just occasional hisses and farts, but grunts
and groans. Kelly had been through periods of irregular constipation in her
life and she often had to sit on the toilet for ages, squeezing as silently as
possible. In private, she was invariably noisy ! And the splashes. Oh how she disliked making, and listening
to, the plops of falling logs. Worst of all for her had been the office
restroom at the company she and Mart had owned and run for 15 years. She would
have installed an executive toilet ! But oh no, Mart
said that would be a waste of company money and set a bad example to the staff.
So she used the same damn ladies room with four stalls as all the other female
employees. She hated emerging from a cubicle having defecated next to somebody,
finding that colleague still washing her hands or touching up her makeup in the
mirror, knowing that a person who worked for her was now aware what Kelly
sounded like on the john. Of course, living with Mart, it had been a little
different. Spend twenty years sharing a bathroom with somebody and you can�t be
too pernickety. But strange that, now she had the ensuite
all too herself, she was more prepared than ever to let him witness her
ablutions �

&nbsp;

She drifted back into the
present as Mart�s tongue curled over her clit.

�No �� she murmured, pushing
on his head. She wanted him lower.

She knew what was coming
seconds before he did !

&nbsp;

Mart felt Kelly�s hand on
his head, pushing him lower.

He could tell she wanted him
off her clit and kissing the over-ripe hanging fruit of her vagina instead.

Damn, she was musky, sopping
wet with a rancid tang. Alain had obviously really given her
a good seeing to that evening. Mart could feel his own dick straining
against the 3 � inches length of its cage. 27 days and
counting. Kelly got to enjoy everything, while he got nothing.

Just what each of them
deserved.

But, damn it was hard !

He dabbed his tongue in the
bottom of her pussy and licked upwards in a slow, teasing wipe, then lowered
his face again to repeat the motion.

Suddenly, he heard a long,
hushed hiss of a fart.

Kelly giggled above him and
her hand pushed down.

�Lower still, darling.�

Her butt scooted an inch
forwards on the pan and her hips lifted.

He put his tongue to the
cleft of her buttocks and licked. He heard her exhale a long sigh and then
another fart cracked into his face. It was shorter, louder, a more typical
�pop�. With a strong aroma.

She giggled again; a
naughty, schoolgirlish sound.

�Kiss me, Mart. Give me some
tongue.�

He stabbed right in, until
his lips were kissing her damp rim, and did his best to ignore the strong
stench. 

He heard her grunt,
straining, and sensed her muscles tightening.

�Unngh
�� she groaned impatiently, �lick Mart. Help me, damn you.�

He ran his tongue to and fro
along her crack as far as his head could fit, moistening her cleft with his
saliva. Suddenly there was a long, loud expulsion of gas.

�Yes !�
Kelly hissed through gritted teeth.

And then her dry stool
emerged bang in front of his chin. He automatically withdrew his head a
fraction, baulking at the reality of what he was doing.

Her fingers pulled his hair
back until he was looking up into her face. She slapped him across the cheek.

�Don�t you dare pull
back your head, Mart !�

He stared at her a split
second then silently lowered his gaze in apology.

�Get your face down in the
pan.�

She opened her thighs and he
rose higher on his knees so he could get between her and stare right down into
the dark toilet. The thick, glistening stool was still hanging, emerging ever
so slowly, before it finally split off and tumbled into the water.

Her fingers played with his
hair, more softly, as they both rested like a strange classical statue; she
sat stroking his head while he knelt abjectly before her, his head lower than
her waist.

She sighed and without
warning a second, much smaller stool splashed into the pan, wetting his
forehead with spray.

Still he waited, as she
showed no sign of finishing. He heard a rustle and realised she had actually
started reading a magazine, resting it on his head.

After an uncomfortable few
minutes, he felt her shift on the seat again.

�Okay.� She said, in a
dreamy voice. �Now my clit. Make me cum.�

&nbsp;

Kelly dropped the mag and started cupping her own breasts, pinching her
nipples. She looked down, watching Mart�s well-practised tongue and lips
worshipping her gaping maw. It would have been the ultimate indignity for her
to defecate in front of any other person. But with him it was different now; in
oh so many ways.

Eventually she climaxed. Nothing special, a little whimper and a nice sleeping tablet of an
orgasm. She�d already enjoyed three, or was it four, whoppers throughout
the day.

But the fun wasn�t over yet.

She let Mart wipe her
bottom. Just one sheet of tissue.

She stared at it with him,
admiring the lush tyre mark on the white background.

�And remind me, Mart. How
long did you say since you came ?�

�Twenty seven days.�

�Mmm
� I guess you wouldn�t want to earn an orgasm by licking my bum now, would you ?�

His green eyes widened and
his mouth fell open, making her laugh.

�Haha. I guess not, hah ? Oh
well, there�s no rush. None at all.�

�No. Please. I would love �
to lick your bottom.�

Oh to be so utterly adored !

�Would you,
darling. Alright then, get to it.�

She stood, bent over with
her hands on the toilet cover.

Let�s be truthful here.
Scatological games did little for her sexually. She had a sensitive bottom and
she liked a wet tongue or finger there, but that was about it in pure sex
terms. No, what she was doing was about power, pure and simple. Throughout
their marriage, Mart had always held the power. She never realised how much
she�d resented it until recently. Being the sweet, docile wife and junior
partner in their marriage and business ! Well now she
was the one in charge and what better symbol of the new arrangement than having
him attend to her on the toilet ?

His nose nuzzled in between
her buttocks. She felt his wet tongue.

�No dear. Reach up and
gently open my ass with your thumbs first.�

She smiled, imagining the
view. Then closed her eyes in bliss as his tongue started
slaving away at the scene of the crime. There was surely still a bit of
evidence for him to gather.

Five minutes later, she
closed the guest room door. It was gone twelve thirty. Phew, that little scene
had taken over half an hour. Still, it wasn�t as if she had anything
particularly arduous planned for the next day !

Mart was tied safely behind
the door to the big brass bed. Teeth well brushed, mouth rinsed with antiseptic
wash, face scrubbed.

His cock and
balls still unrelieved.

She had a challenge for him
in the morning !

&nbsp;

The next morning came a
miracle. A minor one, but a miracle none the less.

She slept soundly. Couldn�t
remember her head touching the pillow and already sunlight was streaming
through a gap in the curtains. 10.04.

Time to wake Mart
so he could serve her breakfast.

He brought her a tray of
coffee, juice and sliced fruit, which she ate while he tidied her bedroom and
hung up her clothes. Afterwards she took a piss.

She was in a heck of a
state. By now, the body odour she exuded was heady and stale.� In the past twenty fours hours, she�d stolen
a quickie with Alain, done yoga, played two sets of tennis, fucked James twice
before dinner at the tennis club, made countless visits to the toilet, not had
a proper wash since the previous morning and now, to cap it all, she�d begun
her period !

So, what harm would it do ?

She returned to the bed and
motioned to Mart to fetch her necklace with his key from the dressing table.
Then she smiled, unlocking his padlock, splaying her body out on the bed.

�A treat.�

He stared at her. Obviously expecting to be jerked off at best.

She smiled, reading his
mind. 

After only fourteen weeks,
they had already reached the extraordinary point where her husband was thrilled
simply to be given third turn in her fetid puss, after a month�s long wait ! Not that he even knew he was third. He didn�t know
about James � yet.

�I meant it when I said we
would mainly make love, Mart. I think your dicklet
has already known quite enough masturbation in its life.�

She reached down, fingering
herself open.

�Kiss me there.�

He dived below to lick her
fishy folds briefly, ungluing her.

�Now � put your � thing in
me.� She moaned, strangely excited.

They kissed, at first on the
cheeks, then locking tongues. For once, Mart didn�t plunge in. He managed to
take his weight on his muscled arms and nuzzle his cockhead
just inside her, stirring her soupy mixture.

She looked at him in
surprise, then shut her eyes as he kept making contact
with her most sensitive bits. A minor miracle.

Well maybe all those times
watching her and Alain weren�t just about humiliation ?
Maybe the frustrating press ups on Martina hadn�t all been a waste of time ?

She climaxed
! Quickly. Not gloriously. It wasn�t the best
she�d ever had. It wasn�t even the best in the past twenty four hours ! But it was a proper orgasm � with just her husband�s
cock. No lips like last night, no vibrator, no fingers as it had been for so
many years.

He was looking down into her
eyes in amazement.

She reached behind his neck
and pulled his ear down to her mouth.

There was only one way for
this to finish !

�Pull out of me, darling.�
She whispered.

His face fell but he
immediately obeyed, sitting back on his haunches. She looked at his glistening,
blood-streaked erection, waving hopefully.

�You are getting better. If
you do it like that, we can make love more often. But you have to learn not to
come; how to satisfy me but then tuck yourself away without making a nasty
mess. Would you like that ?�

�Y � yes.� He stammered,
blushing.

She could tell he was
confused between the thrill of pleasing her, the renewal that having sex still
gave to their marriage, the disappointment and frustration of being denied an
orgasm and, deep down, the masochistic buzz that her casual treatment of him
engendered.

�Let�s go shower.� she said.
�I�ll have a hot one and then you can get in and I�ll turn the water down to
freezing so that stiffy of yours goes away�.

Later that day, on the bus,
Mart opened the note she had given him.

It was brief; another five
words.

�I have a new boyfriend�.

&nbsp;

One week later, both Alain
and the restaurant job were history. There were no bad feelings on either side
but Kelly had decided that her relationship with her French stud had run its
course.

To be honest, Mart was
relieved. He�d never liked the frog. On the other hand, precisely because he
didn�t like him, or his damned job, it had been the most amazingly intense
experience. His first cuckolding had been every bit as humiliating, awful and
exciting as he had hoped and feared.

Alain had enjoyed his role
in their �triangle� and been a good stud. But James was in a different league
altogether. Where Alain enjoyed, James �relished�, where Alain was good,
James was �immense�. Alain was a talented chef and entrepreneur with his own
restaurant aged 28.

But, aged just 35, James was
already one of the most successful sports agents in the UK. He was a qualified
lawyer and he employed 60 people, representing, managing and promoting some of
Europe�s top soccer, golf, tennis and athletics stars. He had personally
handled some of the largest transfer deals in Premiership soccer history. He
had three homes, a powerboat, four cars, and his everyday runabout was a
Ferrari.

And his penis was in
proportion to his success.

&nbsp;

�I�m taking Kelly to Rome.�
He said, his white teeth bright against his chocolate
skin in a handsome smile.

Mart nodded, waiting. He was
now doing 8 hours a day of secretarial work for James, who had set himself up
an office in the small room that used to be Mart�s study. The
room where he once used to work � and masturbate.

Kelly came into the room,
freshly showered, a towel round her hair, holding up a set of sexy lingerie in
each hand.

�These � or these ?� she asked.

James thought a moment.
�Those.�

Mart looked back down at the
pile of paperwork he was sorting.

�You�ll be coming with us.�
James announced, matter-of-factly.

&nbsp;

Mart squeezed into seat 37E
between an overweight Italian momma and a teenage kid with studs through his
eyebrows, nostrils and lips.

An air steward began the
departure procedures. Up front, Mart knew that James and Kelly in seats 1A and
1B would already be sipping drinks and reading magazines. Only a few months
ago, he had travelled Business Class with Kelly all the way to the Caribbean.

Now he was grateful even to
be tagging along at the back of the plane. The security controls had been tense
because he was worried they�d discover his plastic CB but, fortunately, he�d
come through unscathed.

�Bag carrier� is often used as
a term for a junior colleague who goes on a business trip to assist the senior
person, say, making a sales pitch.

But in Mart�s case the term
was more specific and accurate. Throughout the journey he struggled under the
weight of Kelly�s suitcase, separate cosmetics box, James�s holdall, their duty
free purchases, and his own overnight bag.

Kelly waltzed along carrying
just her new Prada handbag and James kept grip of his
own leather briefcase.

At Rome�s Fiumicino airport, they split up. James and Kelly set off
in a taxi straight to dinner at the restaurant he had booked. Mart waited for
the airport bus that shuttled tourists to the hotels in the downtown area.

The hotel was Rome�s finest;
floodlit exterior, red carpet, huge marble entrance hall, you know the kind of
thing.

He handed over the note
James had given him.

The Receptionist smiled
appraisingly. �Aha, si. You
are Senor James�s assistant ! Welcome. You may go
straight up. Room 666.� He handed over a room key but
made no offer of help with the luggage.

Mart lugged the bags up to
the sixth floor and opened the door of the suite.

Then he sat and waited.

&nbsp;

Kelly had drunk a bit too
much but she was sober enough to enjoy it. Although she had plenty of money of
her own now, this was glamour and excitement on a different scale
!

The Italian was, without
doubt, the sexiest footballer she had ever seen. Most players she�d seen on TV
looked like medieval thugs but Alessandro had the classic features and sculpted
body of a renaissance statue.

And he knew how to use his
beautiful cock while she sucked on James�s.

They were on the hotel bed,
a massive four-poster, and she was loving the first
threesome of her life. One young man pounded her pussy from behind and another
gently held her head while she showed off her oral skills. She�d just finished
her period and this was always the time that she was at her horniest. Even
during her �old life�.

She could see Mart in the
background, blurred and out of focus against the Roman night sky, as he stood
meekly in front of the open curtains. He had been allowed to guide the Italian
stallion�s cock between her legs.

This was sex as it was meant
to be. Pure lust, without all the emotional paraphernalia of
love, relationships and marriage. To think she might have reached old
age without once trying a threesome ! Mind you, Mart
would never know what two women at once would be like. Shucks
! Of course, this would be a one-off. She wasn�t a slut. But James had
said he wanted to show her ways to make up for twenty years of boredom.

She knew that she was
probably being used to help lubricate some transfer deal that James was trying
to set up but, frankly, she found that exciting too. Playing
a whore. After all, she was using them too, for her own fun.

Everybody was using
everybody.

Even Mart was, in his own
forlorn way.

James�s big, black cock
throbbed hotly against her cheeks and she cradled the crown with her tongue.
She had become so much better at giving head these past three months. Through
the corner of her eye she could just make out Mart�s expression as her mouth
made a particularly obscene glugging sound.

Well, suck on that husband,
�coz that�s the nearest you�ll get to a BJ.

Alessandro was clearly as
skilled at putting his dick in a chick as he was at putting a ball into the
net. From behind, he caught her in just the right spot.

aangng � mmm �. yessssss �. mmmmmmmm

She watched as sparks seemed
to fly in the starlit sky as she moaned in release. Thirty seconds later, he
was grasping her boobs tighter, and she felt him jerk, uttering some delicious
Italian phrase or other.

He was using a condom and it
felt strange as his wetness was contained inside it. Strange
but sensible. This was just a one night stand.

James murmured a warning
that she appreciated. He knew she was not a swallower.
But she decided to anyway, partly as a reward for the warning and partly
because Mart was watching and she wanted to taunt him.

A huge load of bitter-sweet
sap hit the back of her throat and slid down it before she had time to worry.
She tasted further spurts on her palate and tongue and mixed them with her own
saliva before gulping it all down. There was a discernible aftertaste of
pineapple she was grateful for.

�La dolce vita�.

Sweet life.

&nbsp;

The three days they spent in
Rome marked a new stage in Mart�s downward spiral. Ironically, Kelly had
finished with Alain to protect her marriage. But with James, she had lost
control. It had become more than sex. The future would simply have to take
its course.

James happily took over the
keys to her heart and the lock to Mart�s cage.

�I�ve got nothing against
you, man. But this is my house now, and Kelly�s my lady. You got that ?� he juggled the key in his palm nonchalantly, before
calmly pocketing it.

�Yes, Sir.�

�We�ll have a half dozen
bottles of the 1996.� James said, early that evening, so that �the butler�
would know what to fetch from the cellar for dinner. Mart was dressed in a
tailcoat, waistcoat, pinstriped pants, collar and tie; the traditional butler�s
uniform. The table was laid for twelve people.

�Yes, Sir.�

The doorbell rang at eight
fifteen. Mart opened it and cringed.

Nick and Naomi had been
their friends for years. Naomi and Kelly had both been at school together. It
was obvious they�d been forewarned.

�Hi !�

Both of them stared at him
and Naomi put her hand to her mouth to stifle a laugh. 

Mart heard Kelly�s voice
over his shoulder. �Hi Nao�.
Hi Nick.�

�Kelly !
You look terrific.� Naomi exclaimed, walking past Mart.

Over the next fifteen
minutes, the hall was a constant buzz of arrivals, greetings, kisses, laughter,
coats for him to hang, drinks for him to serve.

Four more couples arrived;
the other three members of Kelly�s tennis foursome with their male partners and
then, last to arrive, was Dylan, Mart�s oldest friend and best man at his
wedding to Kelly, along with Dylan�s latest hot date.

Mart wanted the ground to
swallow him up.

&nbsp;

Kelly was surprised how well
it was going. Surprised, and delighted.

The blurred candlelit faces
round her dinner table were all smiling, relaxed and accepting. This dinner
party had been James�s idea, not hers.

�Her cumming
out party� he called it !

With Alain, she�d sacrificed
her social life for the sake of her affair. And of course, the shame of � well,
what she was doing with Mart.

But James made her realise
that was nothing to be ashamed of. Not for her to be ashamed of anyway. This
was her life. They were her friends. All being well they�d like
the new arrangement.

Even Dylan.

Especially Dylan !

She watched Mart carefully
topping up Ingrid�s wine glass. She was usually Kelly�s tennis partner in their
ladies doubles. Kelly watched Ingrid�s blue eyes and white teeth sparking in
the candlelight as she smirked at Mart. Again, the butler�s uniform had been
James�s inspiration. The first half hour or so had been a bit awkward but once
the alcohol had begun to flow, everybody was treating Mart as a servant. No
more, no less.

Suddenly, she heard the ching of a spoon tapping on glass, and a hush descended on
the dining room.

James was smiling at her
down the length of the table. He raised his glass.

�Ladies and
gentlemen. If I may ?�

All eyes looked at him,
especially Kelly�s.

�Don�t worry.� He laughed.
�No speeches. In fact, I can say all I have to say in just five words.�

FIVE WORDS

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Part Five: November

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�Kelly and I are engaged !�

&nbsp;

There was a stunned intake
of breath and hushed silence.

Faces turned from James to
look back towards her. She blushed, shocked as anybody. Mart�s expression was a
picture. 

Suddenly James burst into
his deep, uproarious baritone laugh.

�Not literally.�

The tension disappeared, rapidly everybody was smiling and chuckling.

�No.� James continued. �She
is legally married to Mart and a very nice couple they make too. But
Kelly has invited me to share her home and I have accepted. In that sense,
we�re engaged to each other. So, a toast, please.�

Everybody raised their
glasses, big grins on their faces.

�To us.�

�To Kelly and James� echoed
round the dining room.

Kelly glanced over at Mart
who was stood quietly holding a bottle.

�Mart. I think a few
glasses need refilling.�

�May I ask a question ?� Naomi said, loud enough for the table to hear.

�Ask away.� Kelly replied.

�We�ll be having our usual
New Year�s Eve party. Should we invite you and James this year, or you and Mart ?�

�Oh me and James,
please.� She replied. �But if you need help in the kitchen, or parking cars,
why not book Mart for the evening ?�

Everybody laughed.

�How much is he an hour ?� one of Kelly�s tennis partners asked.

�No charge for friends, dear ! In fact, I shall be looking for employment to keep
him occupied during daytime hours so if any of you needs
a domestic servant, please just say so.�

�My place is a complete
tip.� A man�s voice said.

It was Dylan. Mart�s oldest friend. He�d been best man at their wedding
and closest mate in the early years of marriage. But Dylan
was a serial womaniser and he�d made one too many passes at Kelly. Once,
at Chantal�s fifth birthday party, Mart had caught them kissing. It was her
only fleeting moment of infidelity until Alain. From then on, Mart�s
relationship with Dylan had cooled and, eventually, all but died. How weird
that he could fall out with a friend over a kiss and yet now, years later, he
could accept another man taking over his wife and home.

�But you live an hour�s
drive away, Dyl.� Kelly replied.

Dylan shrugged. �I�ll pay
fuel. You can�t get good help in my area.�

She smiled. �Mmm � I see. Okay, let�s discuss it after dinner.�

�Mart !�
James voice boomed. �Everybody�s having a great time. Go back down into the
cellar and fetch some more bottles of this excellent 1996.�

&nbsp;

�Can we see
?�

It was past one a.m. One
couple had left but the remaining guests showed no signs of leaving and the
alcohol was doing the talking. Jazz music played quietly in the background.

�Sure.� Kelly replied.
�Anybody up that end of the table mind ?�

James and the two women sat
either side of him broke off from their conversation and smiled. �Not at all.�

�Strip off.�

Everybody watched as her
husband slowly removed his butler�s uniform. Eventually, a blushing Mart stood
naked, but for his Gerecke tube.

�Does it hurt
?� Dylan�s young date asked Kelly.

�No.� she replied. �Not
unless he thinks naughty thoughts.�

She smiled at all the faces
ogling Mart�s embarrassment.

�How long since he � you
know � ?�

�Since he had an orgasm ?� she asked. �I�m not sure. Mart
?�

�Er � f � forty seven days, Ma�am.�

�There you are. Forty seven
days.�

Phew. Dylan whistled.
�Almost seven weeks !�

�Why don�t you let him now ? You know, jerk himself off.�

The speaker was one of her
tennis partners. Ingrid. A stunning blonde with incredible almost albino hair,
white skin and very long legs. She was half Swedish and had something of the
air of a female Nazi officer about her.

�James keeps the key now.�

Everybody looked at James,
who shrugged.

�Kelly has a strict rule
that he can�t masturbate himself. He used to make love to her once in a while
or she did it with her hand. But she hasn�t done that since I came on
the scene.� He rolled his eyes. �I get jealous !�

There was a silence.

�I�ll do it.�

Ingrid.

Kelly looked at Ingrid, then at Will, Ingrid�s date, who didn�t seem to mind.
Finally at Mart who was puce, shining with sweat. She winked at James. Why not ?

�Okay.� James said,
teasingly brandishing the key in his fingertips.

&nbsp;

Mart stood to attention as
the blonde jerked him off in an offhand manner.

Please. A
bit faster.

She was casually holding a
conversation with several others while she did it. They were discussing,
inevitably, masturbation techniques, about why people do it, the best ways,
stuff like that. At one end of the table, Kelly and Dylan were in a deep
t�te-�-t�te but still smiling and watching him, while at the other end James
was serving himself more wine.

Ingrid removed her hand to
lift her coffee cup to her lips.

�Don�t you hate that ?� the guy who was Ingrid�s date laughed. �Women who stop mid-stroke.�

Ingrid looked up into Mart�s
eyes mischievously. Hers were ice blue.

Dangerous.

�I think he�s super grateful
for anything. Aren�t you ?�

Mart breathed in. �Yes,
Ma�am.�

She slid a teasing red
fingernail under his bursting scrotum.

�It looks a bit sore there. Where it�s rubbed.�

Kelly broke off from
whispering to Dylan. �No, that�s fine. We�ve never had a problem. I just had to
change it briefly to a plastic one a couple of times in the early days back in
July and August.�

Ingrid smiled. She started
milking him again, using just two fingers slowly on the ridge of his helmet. Totally blas�. Pre-cum wept from the tip onto the floor.

Please. Go on. A bit more effort. Yes.

She accelerated her hand,
suddenly pumping him properly.

�Get an empty glass ready.�
She murmured to Naomi.

Mart let out a whimper he
couldn�t control. His knees went weak.

Oh yes. He was going to
come. At last. He really was. It had been so long. 47 days and nights. Who knew when he�d be allowed to again. No, don�t think like that. Just enjoy this moment.
They�re all looking at me. What ? A
mobile phone. Somebody took a photo ! Unghh � cummmminnng �.

Ingrid recoiled as he
squirted pulse after pulse into the tilted glass.

�My !�

Everybody was laughing, one or two studied him in fascination.

His penis quivered,
drooling.

It hadn�t been ruined on
purpose. It was better than that. But she hadn�t finished him properly either. She
took her hand away much too early.

�He looks a little pissed
off with you.�

�Ungrateful sod.� Dylan called
out.

�Well �� Kelly drawled five
words.

�That�s enough until
Christmas.�

&nbsp;

�Can I ask you a favour.�

They were in the ladies
locker room. It was three days after the dinner party and Kelly and Ingrid and
their two partners had played three close sets of ladies tennis. Afterwards
they�d all had a giggle at the photos of Mart ejaculating into the glass and
then drinking his �shot�, which Alice had saved onto her cell phone.

Now there were just the two
of them.

�Sure.� Ingrid replied.

�It�s quite a big favour.�
Kelly said.

Ingrid shrugged. �Ask away.�

�James has to go to America
on business. He�s asked me to go with him. We�re going to New York and then
he�s got to go to Chicago and San Francisco while I can spend time with my
daughter in L.A. Then he wants us both to have a vacation in Hawaii.�

�Wow !
Go for it.�

�It�s three weeks in total.�

�And you want me to look
after Mart ?� Ingrid�s blue eyes danced.

Kelly smiled apprehensively.
�You got it ! Would you ?�

Ingrid looked her straight
in the face, suddenly pensive.

�Er � yeah. Sure.�

�William won�t mind ?�

�Will ?
Oh no, he�s just a mate. Kind of friend-with-benefits thing.
He doesn�t live with me.�

Kelly relaxed. �Aloha !� She could already hear the surf and see
the palm trees.

Ingrid�s blue eyes looked
concerned.

�Kel�,
you�re okay aren�t you ? You�re not in love with James ?�

Was she ?

�No.� she replied, a little
too fiercely. �Of course not.�

�Promise
?�

�Cross my heart. But I�ve
spent twenty years married to one man. You�ve divorced two in eight years ! I�m just having my turn.�

Ingrid�s expression was
inscrutable. �So you want me to have Mart.�

�Please.�

�You want to give me some guidelines ?�

�I haven�t really got that
far. I was too worried you�d say no.�

�Hey, you needn�t have been.
Actually, I�m � amused by the idea.�

�Well in that case, I don�t
want him to cause you any trouble. You�ve got a nice house. Have you got
somewhere you can keep him locked up when you�re not using him.�

�Actually I have just the
space. In the basement.�

�Perfect. You see � I really
see this as an opportunity, not a threat. Don�t get me wrong. I�ve enjoyed the
past four months a lot. More than I thought. But dominating Mart is exhausting.
Not physically, but emotionally. I need a break. I want to recharge, that�s
all. In the meantime, I think it would be interesting for � us all, if Mart
experiences something new.�

�New ?�

Kelly took a sip of water
from a plastic cup.

�Yes.� She looked at Ingrid.
�I�m not sure what. I leave it up to you. I saw you the other night, you know �
fucking with him. That�s why I thought of asking you. I want you to � push
him.�

�Push ?
How hard ?�

�Oh don�t hurt him. Not much
anyway. Not like that. Just push a bit further than I seem to be able to� � I guess I mean,
so that he appreciates me more when I return !�

�You mean you don�t want him
to enjoy it too much !�

�Exactly� she laughed.

Ingrid smirked. �My dear,
you asked exactly the right person !�

&nbsp;

�Bye babe.� Mart said.
�Sorry I can�t make it this time. Enjoy your time with mum. Love you.�

Mart blew a kiss down the
phone to Chantal and then handed it back to Kelly. His conversations with his
daughter were few and far between. She had her frantic, fun new life in L.A.

And he had his new life.

�Right.� Kelly said. �Get
in the car.�

He drove her for twenty
minutes to a large Victorian detached home.

Kelly handed him over, with
his small suitcase. She exchanged a few words with Ingrid and climbed back in
the car.

�You forgetting something ?� Ingrid asked.

Kelly looked blank.

�The key to his
thing.�

Kelly laughed. �I nearly
forgot. James has it. Do you need it ? We�re only
going for three weeks.�

�I think I�d better have it
in case of an emergency.�

Kelly nodded. �Yes. I�ll
mail it. Got to dash. We have an early start
tomorrow.�

�Bye Kel.
Have a lovely time !�

�Ooh dear. Don�t worry, I
will.�

&nbsp;

He stood nervously, in
silence, in front of his new �owner�.

He had only met Ingrid the
once. She was a new friend of Kelly�s from her tennis club. At least that made
her less embarrassing than, say Naomi, or another
longstanding friend. But she was a frightening woman. Apparently only 30, yet
she�d gone through two husbands and reputedly broken several more hearts. She
was stunningly beautiful; athletic, fit, short blonde hair, with prominent
breasts, a slim waist, and long legs. Yet there was a butchness, an aloofness, about her that wasn�t sexy.

�So ��

Her English was infallible
but if you listened hard, she had a slightly clipped accent. More
South African than Scandinavian.

� � alone at last.�

She grinned. Or, at
least, she curled her lips and bared her perfect teeth.

�How does it feel saying
goodbye to your darling wife ?�

Terrifying.

�Er � kind of
sad to see her go.�

�Kind of sad,
huh.� She mused. �Boy I wish my first husband had been like you. He caught
me fooling around and that was that ! But you see your
wife depart for three weeks fucking in the sun and all you feel is � kind of
sad. Have you ever sucked her boyfriend�s cock ?�

No way, Jose.

�No � Ma�am.�

Ingrid chuckled. �No limits.
That�s what you said to Kelly, right ?�

�Um � yes. That�s correct.�

�You know what she said to me ?�

He shook his head.

�She asked me to push your
limits. Way further than she can herself.�

Mart bit his lip.

This time she let out a full
blown laugh. �Yes. We�re going to have ourselves a whole lotta
fun !�

&nbsp;

The cellar was down a stone,
spiral staircase. During World War II, when several officers had been
garrisoned in the big Victorian house, four �lock up� cages had been built for
storing their suitcases and private possessions. Three cages were the same size
and the one at the end was smaller.

Ingrid had inevitably chosen
the one at the end !

It had a stone and brick
floor, ceiling and three walls. The front wall of the cage was made of steel
rods, like a prison cell, with a doorway cut into it. The door itself was made
of the same rods and there was a rectangular, mail box sized opening next to
the bolt and padlock. The opening was originally so any unforwarded
letters or packages could be posted into the officer�s cage ready for his
return.

�Welcome.� She said to him.
�Get in.�

He stooped through the low
door. The cage was about 6� x 6� square and about 5� 6� high. He would have hit
his head if he stood up straight. There was a bright light bulb in the ceiling
with a protective wire tube round it.

�Strip naked.�

She watched him
dispassionately as he removed all his clothes.

�Hand them to me.�

He passed her the bundle of
sweater, pants, shirt, socks, shoes. He shivered. It
had to be only a few degrees above zero down here. He was dressed in his Gerecke chastity device and that was all.

He heard her turn the key in
the heavy padlock on the door.

�Stand to attention.�

He put his feet together and
looked straight ahead.

She pulled a camcorder on a
tripod out from the shadows and set it up facing him. He watched her fiddle
with a couple of wires.

�I can check up on you at
any time with this. I can watch from any one of three televisions upstairs. You
are being recorded on DVD. Smile !�

He grimaced for the lens as
she adjusted the focus.

�You will stand to attention
exactly like that unless I say otherwise. Is that understood
?�

�Yes � Ma�am.�

�Do not move. Do not speak.
Don�t even scratch your nose. I understand you are � toilet trained
?�

�Yes, Ma�am.�

�So do not do anything but
stand there until I return.�

With that, she was gone.

&nbsp;

After about ten minutes, he started
feeling ridiculous. He was stood under the bright bulb, staring out through the
bars at the lens, and beyond into an empty cellar. He could see the little red
recording light on the camera but had no idea if she was watching him or when
she might return.

After about thirty minutes
his legs started to ache.

After an hour he was bored
stiff and his whole body ached.

After maybe two hours his
stomach started to growl. Kelly had only allowed him an apple for lunch because
he was busy ironing her clothes for packing. Also, he could have used a piss.

After another hour or so, he
couldn�t help moving about a bit to stretch his limbs and get his blood
circulating. He figured it had to be about eight o�clock in the evening by now.

In seconds, he heard
clacking footsteps of her heels on the stone stairs. She was carrying three
identical steel bowls, stacked one on top of the other.

�Why did you disobey me ?�

She must have been watching
him.

�I got too stiff. I�m sorry
but I had to move a bit.�

She put two of the bowls
down on the floor. The third was full of what looked like stew. It smelt good
and steam was rising off it.

She posted one empty bowl
through the letterbox in the door.

�Your toilet.�

He took it and placed it in
the corner of his cage.

She passed him the second
one.

�Your
drinking bowl.�

He took it. It was empty.

She held up the bowl of stew
and looked at him through the bars.

�It is much better to obey
me.�

Her hand turned 180 degrees
and she emptied the entire contents of the bowl onto the stone floor outside
the cage.

�Oh dear. My arm got too
stiff.� Her imitating voice mocked him. �I�m soooo
sorry but I had to move it a bit.�

She posted the bowl through
the letterbox. There was a smear of gravy left.

�Enjoy !�
she said. �And then you may go to sleep�.

He watched her turn on her
heels and walk up the stairs.

In seconds, he was plunged
into darkness.

&nbsp;

He had no idea what time it
was when the light came back on. It might have been midnight, 4 a.m. or
morning. There was no sound and she didn�t appear. After a couple of minutes,
lying curled on the stone floor, he stood up and
assumed the sentry position looking at the camera.

Just in case.

It was hours later when he
heard her on the stairs.

�Good boy.� She said,
smiling. Or what passed for her smile.

She was dressed in a silk
robe and fur slippers. 

�Pass me your drinking bowl.�

He handed it to her, knowing
what was coming.

She disappeared round a
corner into another cage. He heard her call out.

�Kel
tells me you�re not too fussy about what you drink.�

She seemed to be waiting for
a reply. �No Ma�am.�

�That�s good.�

He heard the sounds of her
urinating into the bowl.

Moments later, she
reappeared and passed it through the hole.

It was plentiful, dark,
almost egg-yolk colour, stinking of cabbages.

�Whoops, I forgot.� She
shrugged. �We are what we eat ! Too
many veggies last night.�

He stared down at it.

�No rush.� She sneered.
�Just drink it when you get thirsty enough.�

She waited while he placed
it on the hard floor, then opened the camcorder, extracted the disc and
inserted a new one.

�Today, you really will stand
to attention for the camera until I say otherwise. Is that understood
?�

He snapped into position,
feet together, arms stiff, eyes in front.

�Yes � Ma�am.�

�If you wish to eat tonight,
do not move or speak. Clear ?�

�Yes, Ma�am.�

�So do not do anything but
stand there until I return.�

And with that, she was gone again.

&nbsp;

The hours crawled past.

He found that he had two
choices; either he blanked his mind which made the time go incredibly slowly,
or he thought about stuff � mainly sex in some shape of form � which passed the
time but increased the frustration levels in his balls. It was only six days
since he�d had an orgasm at the dinner party but already he was climbing the
walls. Six days ! Only a few months ago he almost
never went more than 24 hours without some sort of release. He felt tired,
uncomfortable, his armpits stank and his breath was fuggy.

Down in the cellar the world
was a different place. Was it morning or afternoon ?
Day or night ? Was she in, or had she gone out ? The camcorder�s red light, its probing lens and his
own boredom were all he had for company.

He thought about the past
four months. The evening when Kelly asked him if his offer
still stood. And everything that had happened since.
The restaurant. Alain. The chastity. The chores. The fitness regime and his diet. The things Kelly had made
him do. James. The trip to Rome. The
footballer. The dinner party. Dylan. And Ingrid. Was this really what he wanted
? Had it gone too far ? How was it all going to
end ?

Finally, who-knew-when, she
appeared. She was carrying another steaming bowl. It gave off a delicious scent
of curry.

�I�ve spoken to Kelly.
They�re in New York. Staying at the Mercer. She�s loving it. She didn�t even ask about you.�

Mart nodded. Frankly he
was too thirsty, famished and tired to care.

�I see your drink is not to
your liking.� She observed.

He glanced down at her curdled urine.

�I � I didn�t want to move.
You said to stay standing still.�

�Did I ?
Oh no. I wanted you to drink that all up.�

He started to kneel down but
heard a splatter on the floor. She had again tipped the entire contents of the
bowl of curry onto the floor.

She shrugged. �You�ll get it
right in the end.�

He couldn�t think straight.

�But ��

She didn�t even bother to
post the smeared bowl to him.

�Go to sleep.�

Moments later, he was
plunged into darkness.

&nbsp;

He barely slept; cold,
starving and sore as he was.

He assumed it was morning
when she woke him. This is not fun, lady. But he dragged himself to his
feet to face her chirpily.

�Good morning Ma�am�.

She grinned. She was
carrying another bowl of curry. Curry for breakfast ?
Yuk. But he was so hungry he could eat a log.

�Good boy.� She sniffed the
bowl exaggeratedly. �Mmmmmm !�

�Please �� He murmured,
unable to prevent himself begging.

She glanced down approvingly
at the empty drinking bowl. He�d lapped it completely clean during the night.

�I see I need to refill your
drink. Well, eat this first.�

She passed the brimming bowl
carefully through to him. The oily brown sauce was hot and spicy. She�d even
garnished it with a leaf of parsley.

He looked at her. �How shall
I eat it, Ma�am ?�

�On the floor, of
course. Like a dog.�

He crouched, set it down, then knelt in front of the bowl.

�May I start, Ma�am ?� he asked, looking up at her.

She smiled at him
enigmatically. �When you like.�

Pieces of meat and vegetable
floated in the spicy sauce. It was too hot to eat. He blew on the surface to
cool it. He heard her lips tut-tutting.

�I haven�t got all day you know !�

He blew hard then slurped up
a mouthful of sauce. It was scalding. Too hot to taste.
He burnt his tongue and throat and choked it down.

�Hurry up
!�

He blew and slurped, blew
and slurped. Gradually it cooled slightly and he could taste more. The aromatic
spices overpowered the other ingredients.

�Finished
?� he heard her ask, impatiently.

�No Ma�am.� He gulped. There
was a chunk of gristle that he tried chewing through and spat out in disgust.

�I trust you�re not being fussy ?�

He shook his head, attacking
a large sausage-like piece of something.

�Last mouthful.� She stated,
hurrying him.

He vacuumed up a large piece
with sauce and bit into it. Slowly, or at least in slow motion, he gagged. He
realised what it was. He spat.

She was laughing above him. Afterwards
he reflected that it wasn�t a cruel snigger at him. It wasn�t a kind chuckle
with him either. It was something in between. Like somebody might titter at a
corny joke. 

He spat, spat and spat, unable to get rid
of it all. It was in his teeth, gums, under his tongue, at the back of his
throat.

He heard her heels clacking
as she walked back up the stairs.

&nbsp;

Later, much later, she
reappeared.

She was wearing tennis
whites, slurping an iced drink through a straw. Perspiration made her top stick
to her large breasts.

�Please.� He said. �I know
agreed no limits. But this isn�t � fun.�

Her blue eyes surveyed him
like he was something in a shop window.

�Fun ?
That�s a strange word. Whoever said this was meant to be fun
?�

He baulked, scared of
annoying her. �But � it needs � you know.�

�No. I don�t know.�

His instincts suddenly told
him this woman was dangerous. Like Sharon Stone in whatever that movie was.

�Please ��

She started laughing. �Okay
Mart. We�ll try things another way. You can be my maid. But disobey me once,
just once, and I�ll lock you back down here and throw away the key. Got that ?�

�Yes.� He enthused. �Absolutely.�

�Yes, Madame Ingrid.�

�Yes, Madame Ingrid !� he echoed.

&nbsp;

After a shower, shave all
over, brushed teeth and combed hair, he dressed in the outfit she had purchased
from an online transvestite store for him; fishnet stockings, miniskirt, padded
bra, tight blouse. And an oversized pair of stiletto heels with locking buckles
that kept his feet arched at an uncomfortable angle.

She waved the key to his Gerecke tube.

�I�m going to unlock you.
But I�ll be watching closely. You must never touch yourself without
permission. Is that a hundred percent clear ?�

�Yes, Madame Ingrid.�

�I have three friends
arriving for drinks shortly. You will serve us.�

�Yes, Madame Ingrid.�

She gestured to a drinks
tray, a fridge and cupboard of glasses.

�Are you hungry, thirsty ?�

�Yes. Very,
Madame Ingrid.�

She smiled. �You don�t want
any more of my nice curry ?�

�No, Madame
Ingrid.�

�In that case do everything
I say.�

�Yes, Madame Ingrid.�

�Do not touch our food or
drinks.�

�Of course, Madame
Ingrid.�

&nbsp;

Half an hour later, Ingrid
and three other women all in their late twenties or early thirties were
lounging on chairs, gossiping, giggling and guzzling back drinks and nibbles.
He stood in the corner, cursing the painful heels, his dick poking out
underneath his miniskirt, wearing rouge, lipstick and eyeliner. He kept their
glasses topped up and the plates full.

�So who�s this Kelly girl ?�

�Oh she�s a friend from the
tennis club. Met her recently.�

�And she�s in the States ?�

�Yes. For three weeks. Maybe longer.�

What�s that
? Maybe longer ? Is that what she said ?

�With her new man ?�

They all laughed and glanced
over at Mart.

�Yep.� Ingrid replied,
giving him a wink.

�And meanwhile you�re
looking after him ?�

�You could put it like
that.�

Another round of
laughs.

�What does he do ?�

�Er
� pretty much anything. We�re just getting to know
each other first.�

�Anything
?�

Ingrid shrugged and raised
an eyebrow. He walked forwards as daintily as possible carrying two bottles and
refreshed the ladies� glasses.

As he was withdrawing,
Ingrid reached and held his penis.

It was three-quarters erect,
even though he�d tried to control it.

�Anything.� She replied
coldly.

�Not the biggest.�

�Why do you think Kelly�s
across the pond getting some action.�

Yet more
hysterical laughter. Hah bloody hah.

Ingrid teased his shaft
absent-mindedly.

�Makes you think, doesn�t it ?� One of the three women asked. The
best looking. She was petite with small breasts and lovely dark eyes.

�What ?�
asked the plain one; overweight with a bulging cleavage.

�Well, you know, think about
what to look for in a husband. I mean, your Kelly friend did alright didn�t she ? Family, kid, company, money.
And now she�s off enjoying herself, just when most women are settling for a hot
drink and a comfortable seat in front of the TV.�

�Yeah. Shucks !�

�Some girls get all the
luck.�

They all rolled about on
their chairs.

�Too bad Kelly�s coming back
for this one.� The petite one said, eyeing Mart.

Ingrid glanced up at him and
then smiled at her friend.

�Actually, she might not
be.�

He realised with a shudder
that short, frightening sentence contained just five words. 

&nbsp;

It was five to eight in UK,
and 14.55 hrs in New York.

Kelly stared at the bedside
clock in the hotel bedroom as James pounded her from behind, both enjoying the
first lazy afternoon fuck they�d managed to fit into the trip so far.

Truth was she felt a little
guilty she hadn�t called Ingrid. She wanted to check everything was okay and to
ask about Mart. She had this uneasy feeling. Call it an intuition.

But she also had this wonderful
feeling. You spend time alone with a guy and pretty soon you know. James was
sophisticated, funny, intelligent and gorgeous. He could ring her bells
effortlessly as he was now. Giving her a wonderful feeling in
her head and between her thighs. But he was a lover, that�s all. She
didn�t love him. Never would. No threat. She loved Mart. Strange, she realised
something as another man drove her to a steadily mounting climax on hotel
sheets. She missed her husband.

The digital clock ticked
over to 14.56.

She watched it. Now would be
a good time to ring and check.

But she felt James�s breath
on her shoulder, nuzzling her hair, and his strong, elegant fingers cupped
underneath her hanging breasts, teasing her hard nipples.

Oh, fuck it, Mart would have
to wait.

And she twisted her face up
to kiss James, murmuring five words to him.

�I am going to cum !�

FIVE WORDS

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Part Six: December

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

She thought she was about to
cum � Whoa lady !

James jerked back so that
his glistening erection slipped out of her pussy with a sloshing sound.

�Not yet, baby.� He
murmured, pecking her earlobe, fingers releasing her nipples, removing all
contact with her erogenous zones.

She hissed in frustration.
He smiled down at the pretty curve of her spine as she arched her back and
reversed into him, hungrily seeking his dick.

Time to start
working for a living lady.

He grasped her shoulders and
gently guided her around on the large bed so she was facing him. He kissed her,
then glanced meaningfully down at his jutting shaft.

�Kiss me, baby.� He urged
her quietly but firmly. �There.�

A shadow flitted across her
brown eyes and for a split second her aroused smile twisted into a grimace. But
she blinked and opened her lips.

�Sure.�

He watched her lower her
head and scoot back on the sheets so she could take him in her mouth. For a few
seconds she kind of nibbled the crown, like she was sampling it, then he
impatiently pushed down on her head and felt her struggling to absorb his
girth.

She hadn�t blown him since
Rome. He knew she wasn�t keen. But that�s why he had to push her, test her.

Because if she wasn�t
prepared to do a small thing like suck his dick, then she sure as hell wasn�t
going to do a big thing like come up with the cash.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Ingrid smiled across at Lou.

In front of them, Mart was
bound tightly to a metal ladder. The ladder itself was pointing almost straight
up, leaning at just a slight incline against the ceiling beam in the centre of
the room. Ropes secured it firmly in place.

They had tied Mart�s ankles
standing on the second lowest rung, with his outstretched wrists tied to the
second highest rung. Strong garden twine also bound his knees, waist,
underarms, neck and elbows into a rigid standing position along the ladder.

He was now helpless and
vulnerable. His buttocks and back were presented like slabs of meat at a
butcher�s. And through the ladder�s slats, his face, nipples and genitals were
framed by the metal squares like sculptures at an art gallery.

Ingrid studied Mart�s eyes. Green. You could tell so much from eyes. Unlike lips,
eyes never lie. He was fearful and she liked that. It made her feel � good.

Both women reached out and
fingered Mart�s dangling scrotum and penis. Shrunken with
nerves.

�Eshtraordinary.� Lou slurred.

Ingrid smirked at her. She
and Lou had this kind of open relationship. Not lesbian. Not even occasionally
bi, really. But they discussed everything totally honestly with each other. Especially sex. And that had led to a bit of
experimentation. Lou�s delicate, brunette looks appealed to Ingrid.

�What ?�
she asked.

�How harmless dicks look
when they�re shoft.� Lou was slightly drunk.

Ingrid chuckled in
agreement. �Yes.�

She ran her red fingernail
under Mart�s balls and watched his eyes. His dick twitched and his pupils
widened.

Cute. But she didn�t
want him to know that. She had already decided that Mart would make her perfect
third � and final � husband. A marriage totally on her terms at last. Mart had
sold one successful company. He could build her another. It was silly wasting
him on minimum wage restaurant work.

And Mart was hardly going to
divorce her for any infidelities, was he ?

Kelly had taken the genie
out of the bottle and done her best. But now it was time for Ingrid to take
over the reins.

All that was required was
for Kelly and James to fall in love and then Ingrid could pick up the pieces.

She smiled down dreamily at
Mart�s now hardened shaft, then gazed at the
apprehensive longing in his green eyes. She turned to her friend.

�You ever heard of CBT, Lou ?�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

James smiled down
absent-mindedly as Kelly gurgled and salivated on his dick. He could tell it
had become a question of pride for her now. She wanted to show him she could
give him as good a time as some hot chick half her age. It wasn�t even about
her orgasm any more. It was about his.

He pushed strands of her
hair aside so he could watch his thick sausage disappearing and emerging in a
nice easy rhythm.

Like taking candy
from kids.

His mind returned to the
important question. How to get from this point, the fun part, to his real goal,
the money ?

He had until January 31st
but the weeks were racing by and this lady wasn�t a gullible fashion model like
Simone. She wasn�t just going to write him a cheque for three million pounds.
He�d have to extract it skilfully.

He put his finger under her
chin and raised her head up so he could kiss her lips. It was time to put her
out of her misery.

He eased her back down onto
the bed and mounted her. He pushed her legs up high, outside his extended arms,
as he took his weight above her, giving her the full deep penetration
treatment. She groaned, gripping the headboard, as he fucked her. She was excited,
wet, almost loose around him.

�Mmm
� you�re so tight, baby.� He whispered.

He focused briefly on his
task. He played her like a musical instrument, sawing in and out, eliciting a
crescendo of shrieks from her gasping mouth, her head back, eyes rolling, until
she�d reached not one, not two, but three successive climaxes. The real rag
doll treatment !

Eventually, she descended
from her state of semi-consciousness.

�You didn�t cum.� She said,
nibbling her lower lip.

He smiled down at her with
his mouth.

�Nor does your
husband.�

She made a face. �That�s
different.�

He shrugged. �Your pleasure
is the most important thing.�

Another shadow passed across
her uncertain gaze.

He grinned inwardly. All
chicks hate it when you say that.

�What do you want ?�
she asked. �I�ll try. Name it. Anything.�

He chuckled outwardly. Softly, softly, catchee monkey.

�You may regret saying
that.�

Just for a moment he thought about
suggesting her finishing the blowjob she�d started, or trying anal, but those
treats could wait. He wouldn�t waste the opportunity on sex yet. Now he had an
intro to the subject of an � �investment
opportunity� instead.

He was still inside her.
Slowly he started building a rhythm again, like a train chugging out of a
station, increasing speed.

It had been a stroke of
fortune meeting Kelly at the tennis club. A few days before they met, he had
thankfully been found �not guilty� of fraud and taking illegal backhanders, in
an investigation into several Premiership transfers he�d been involved in.
However, the Revenue nevertheless required the small matter of �4 � million in
back taxes and penalty interest on various offshore payments that had been
undisclosed.

Three million
pounds of which he didn�t have available.

He hammered into her,
unleashing a healthy downpayment into Kelly�s MILF
cunt. In a few weeks, once he�d achieved his main goal, he could start having
some fun. She thought she was in control, heh ? Well, nobody bosses James Pettigrew
lady. Soon enough she�d be doing some nice kinky stuff in between him loaning
her tits and ass out to his clients.

And for some strange reason,
as he slowly pulled his softening dick out of her squishy cunt, his mind
flashed to Mart, back home, unaware that James was not only going to fuck
royally with his wife.

He was going to be paid
handsomely for doing so.

�What are you grinning at ?� she asked him, as he glanced down.

�Me ?
Just at how lucky I am to have met you.�

&nbsp;

Mart lay slumped against the
ladder. His body quivered, drenched in a sheen of
sweat. At last the physical pain had receded into a feeling of mere discomfort
but, now he could think properly, the mental anguish had increased to
compensate.

The enormous vibrator was
finally switched off, but it was still wedged all the way up into his rectum,
with electrical tape holding it in. He was an anal virgin no more. It was
something Kelly had teased him with but never done. She had known deep down
that it was a measure of his manliness.

But Ingrid knew none of
that. Or wasn�t interested.

An hour earlier, she and her
friend had delighted in showing him the shiny pink toy. Holding
it up to their forearms so he could compare its huge size. Setting it buzzing, gyrating and sensuously coating it with
lubricant.

It had taken them several
minutes of pulling his butt apart, pushing it in, cajoling and berating him.
He�d groaned, cried, begged, to no avail. Every muscle, every resistance point
was overcome, until it was all the way in, making him feel as if he�d been
constipated for weeks.

�What are you smiling at ?� Lou asked Ingrid.

Their excited faces were
inches from his, studying him.

�I�m thinking that if he
makes that much fuss about a vibe, I wonder what he�ll be like when it�s a real
dick.�

�No !�
Lou giggled. �You wouldn�t !�

�Sure I would. I was
thinking Kevin.�

�Kevin. Of
coursh.�

With the vibrator buzzing
and churning at full speed in his guts, they had turned their alcohol-fuelled
attentions to his helpless genitals. Mart shuddered when he saw the bright red
tube with fiery lettering.

Deep Heat.

Maximum Strength.

Ingrid held the tube up to
his face and read the details aloud to him; a cream emulsion containing 8%
menthol, for the relief of muscular pain and stiffness.

�And,� she licked her lips
suggestively, �the treatment of other types of stiffness too.�

She squeezed a generous
dollop onto the palm of her hand and another dose onto Lou�s fingers. Then both
women began massaging his cock and balls. Ingrid slowly painted every inch of
his penis while Lou pushed her fingers underneath his legs coating from his
prostate to his scrotum. Ingrid was careful to apply plenty to his crown and
squished some into his urethra, while Lou massaged each tender testicle in
turn.

In seconds, his skin had
ignited, like a campfire sparking. Slowly the heat began to build, before
momentum increased, and suddenly the fire was ablaze, and every nerve ending in
his groin had become an inferno.

He howled, beads of sweat
sprouting from his forehead. The heat was like a forest fire, travelling up his
spinal column, so that he felt as if his entire body was covered in the Deep
Heat cream. His eyes watered.

Through blurred vision, he
could see Ingrid and Lou making faces at him, imitating his expressions. They
were blowing out their cheeks, rolling their eyeballs, as if they themselves
had eaten a terribly spicy curry.

He managed to peer down at
his penis. He was surprised to see it was still erect, throbbing, although he
couldn�t feel it. It was as if it had been cut off and a burning torch attached
in its place.

�Please �� he gasped at them
�stop the pain. I can�t bear it.�

�Oh but you can.� He heard
Ingrid reply through the cymbals clashing in his ears. She lifted a hand to cup
his cheek. �You have no choice.�

He watched them withdrawing
to the sofa, where they could still see him, but in comfort. They refilled
their glasses, adding loads of ice. Ingrid pressed the remote and music filled
the room.

The Red Hot Chilli Peppers ! Hah fucking hah.

He screwed his eyes shut,
unable to look. The continued churning of the vibrator in his rectum and the
flames in his groin were overwhelming.

It was hard to breathe. Impossible to think or move. He just stood there, gasping,
sweating, hurting.

For almost an
hour.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It was midnight. Kelly and
James had been to the theatre on Broadway. They were now finishing their spicy,
after-theatre Thai dinner.

�You seem a bit distracted.�
She said, breaking the silence.

In fact, he�d been a
nightmare ever since their afternoon bout of sex. She suspected that he was
pissed at her for not giving better head.

Well fuck him
! Mart had put up with her for twenty years including her lack of
interest in the finer points of fellatio.

�Do I ?
Sorry. Just a business opportunity I�m mulling over in my mind.�

She watched him sip his
coffee distractedly. He had barely bothered to disguise his boredom during the
play. He was a sports fan not a theatre buff, he�d explained, during the
interval.

�The check,
please.� He said to a passing waiter.

She glanced round the
restaurant at the couples and groups around them; faces in animated conversation,
laughing, listening. She remembered the last time she�d been to the theatre, in
London, with Mart, back in June.

Just a few weeks before her
world had turned upside down.

�Fancy going to a club ?� he asked.

It took her a moment to
register what he�d said. She was thinking how she and Mart always enjoyed
analysing a play afterwards.

�Um ��

�Come on.� He urged,
suddenly enthusiastic. �I know a great place.�

�Er � okay.�

When the waiter came with the bill, she
watched James ostentatiously remove several $100 bills from a large roll and
drop them on the tray.

Well at least he wasn�t after her for
her money.

&nbsp;

The club was the sort of
place Kelly had never much liked; too many flashing lights, too much noise,
difficult to speak and impossible to hear. Sweaty young bodies crammed jiving
and flirting up against each other.

James pulled her through the
throng to an area that was a little quieter with softer lighting and topless
waitresses wearing cat-masks.

�Great, huh
?� he shouted into her ear.

She nodded.

�Two Vodkatinis.� He said to one of the
well-endowed waitresses.

The bar area was less packed
than the dance floors but still crowded. A throng of beautiful people hung out,
male and female; each was more gorgeous, better dressed and youthful than the
next.

She couldn�t help noticing
that James attracted several sly looks from young women, but in turn only a
solitary middle aged, executive type had undressed her with his bespectacled
eyes.

�See that girl.� James
whispered loudly right into her ear.

A gorgeous black girl was
standing at the bar, slightly aloof, apparently unaccompanied. She seemed to be
staring straight back at Kelly.

He grinned. �She likes you.�

Kelly gulped.

�You�ve tried a two-man
threesome.� He winked. �Now how about a two-woman threesome
?�

She stared at him.

�You said this afternoon,
�anything�. Well, why not ?�

Without waiting, James
gestured to the black girl.

Kelly watched the beauty
doing one of those corny �who me ?� acts, before
finally sidling over. She walked with the exaggerated, sensuous gait of a
catwalk model.

James stood up, kissing her
hand, ushering her into an empty seat.

�Hi.� He said. �I�m James.
And this is Kelly.�

The girl flashed them both a
brilliant smile. �Hi. My name�s Simone.�

�We�re pleased to meet you,
Simone.� He said. �Aren�t we Kelly ?�

&nbsp;

By now, it was dawn in
England, and Ingrid was fast asleep in her four poster.
Mart was curled up on the floor at the foot of the bed like a dog.

A thunderstorm was rattling
the bedroom windows, and occasional flashes of lightning sliced through a gap
in the curtains like a white knife. A particularly loud clap of thunder woke
her. She�d been enjoying a naughty dream about the first night of her honeymoon
with Mart and she stared into the darkness, momentarily disorientated. 

She lay there, getting her
breath. She could feel the warmth between her legs and her nipples brushed
against the sheet. In the dream she�d been enjoying an orgy with Lou, Kelly and
James while Mart watched them all.

Up to that point, she had
not considered using Mart sexually. He was a toy to play with, a potential
husband and support, but not a sexual partner.

She could hear his steady
breathing below her feet.

Give in to it, she thought.
You know you want to.

�Mart.� She called, over
the noise of the rain. �Wake up.�

She heard him stir. Seconds
later she was able to make out his silhouette standing in the murky light.

�Come here.�

She threw back the covers to
make a space for him. He stood by the bed.

�Still pissed with me ?� she asked, an amused tone in her voice.

�� No � Ma�am.� He
eventually replied.

�Climb onto the bed.�

She shifted so he could join
her.

�Kelly told me you�re good
with your mouth. Is that true ?�

�� I � h � hope so, Ma�am.�

�Well, let�s see, shall we ?�

She raised her knees and
parted them, making a tent with the covers. Mart slowly shuffled under them and
she felt him getting into position.

Then a bolt of lightning
illuminated the room as his lips zapped her moist heat.

Maybe this was the way to go
after all ? She lay back on the bed,
head nestled in the pillow, and gave into the sensations. He was pretty good.

Where are you Kel, girl ? Hope you�re having fun ! Cos� I am.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�Give in to it.� James
urged. �No man can do it like another woman.�

Kelly was laying
back on their hotel bed. James was cradling her head in his hands, kissing her
on the lips, while Simone was hunched between her thighs, teasing her with
butterfly kisses.

She felt her knees being
eased further apart, raising her hips. She slowly gave in to the sensations. It
was no longer a woman�s mouth.

Just lips,
tongue, probing, wet, skilled.

Suddenly James was no longer
kissing her. She was vaguely aware of him lowering his pants and then suddenly
his great slab of meat was in her face again, homing in on her mouth.

She gave in and shifted her
head so she could suckle him. Dimly, she saw his hands also stroking Simone�s
frizzy hair, to her shoulders. His torso glowed in the lamplight, rippling
abdomen like a squared chocolate bar.

Two minutes went by as they
made a noisy but wordless tableau; a slurping, gasping triangle of
half-dressed, vodka-infused flesh.

Smiling, James leaned, eased
his erection from her lips and nodded, as if to say; thanks for the warm up
act.

She watched in silence as he
walked around Simone, crouched on the bed, and mounted her from behind in one
smooth movement.

Simone�s hot breath tickled
Kelly�s clitoris as she groaned. The snaking tongue slithered agonizingly
slowly up each millimetre of her labia. Somehow, the girl seemed able to keep
her constantly on the brink of the abyss.

But Kelly also felt
irrelevant, an appendage to two people fucking. She looked up at James in the
lamplight and saw a different expression on his face as he teased himself and
Simone with his magic wand.

They looked so good together. Like
lovers, not one-nighters. He hadn�t even used a
condom.

In Rome, the thrill of illicit sex had
made her feel liberated. Lust as it was meant to be. She�d been glad she�d
tried a new experience. But here in New York, underneath the current hazy buzz
of booze and sex, she knew this was a little sordid. A nagging hangover would
linger in the morning.

And then she saw something
she�d never seen. James lost it. His grimace of ecstasy and agony, of
disappointment and thrill, as he realised he had unintentionally past the point
of no return. For ten long seconds he groaned in release.

Simone took it in her
stride, glancing up for a split second at Kelly, giving her a cheeky reassuring
grin, then continued her teasing licks.

Eventually James was
standing by the bed again, slime glistening from the tip of his sagging
erection.

�Come.� He said, gently
lifting Kelly�s head.

Then he manoeuvred Simone
too, tugging her waist around.

He wanted them both in a 69
position.

Simone�s slim, muscled legs
nestled either side of Kelly�s ribs. Then, super-slowly, she lowered her
haunches.

No, no, no
! Kelly wanted to scream.

But she didn�t. She just lay there. At
least the girl was beautiful. Her dark skin smelt of lavender and musk, flesh
tight in a swirl of mysterious curves and hollows. Her pubic mound was shaved
completely hairless. Her wetness glistened like molten chocolate.

�Try it. You�ll love it.�

James�s smirking face was inches away
from her, watching.

Then darkness enveloped her.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

At ten o�clock, Mart brought Ingrid a
tray with breakfast in bed; tea, juice, cereal, sliced fruit. He�d even found a
small vase and put a single flower in it.

She patted the bed after he�d placed the
tray down.

�Sit here.�

He�d dressed in the high heels,
miniskirt, and tight top she�d given him the evening before. She chuckled at
his appearance.

�I need to tell you something Mart.�

�Yes Ma�am.�

�I spoke to Kelly yesterday. I�m afraid
she�s not coming back.�

His mouth fell open like a fish. �But ��

�Shhh.� She said. �Of course she�s coming back. But
not as planned. You see, after Hawaii, they�re going to Las Vegas. For the Christmas holidays and New Year.�

Mart nodded, apparently
relieved.

She smiled at him kindly. �You ever been
to Vegas, Mart ?�

He shook his head. �No, Ma�am.�

�Great place. Fun capital of the globe.�

She paused, taking a sip of her tea.

�And you know what else. It�s the wedding
capital of the world too.�

He frowned. She placed her hand on his
shoulder.

�Kelly is going to marry James, Mart.�

He stared at her, face crumbling, and
then put his head in his hands.

�I�m afraid that, as of yesterday Mart,
you are already legally divorced !�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Kelly lay awake in the dark, listening to
the even breathing of James and Simone next to her in the large King bed.

The digital clock said 05.15. A quarter
past ten in England.

She thought of using the phone in the ensuite bathroom to call Ingrid.

What was it that Joan had said ? Joan was an old friend of Mart�s who�d run off with a
younger guy after fifteen years of marriage and three lovely kids. Six months
later she�d come slinking back, asking for forgiveness. A
while later, after too many drinks, Kelly had asked Joan why it hadn�t worked
out with her boyfriend.

Joan replied wistfully; �he didn�t
know the jokes�.

Point being that Joan and her husband
knew the punch lines and when to laugh. They could recount a funny story or
memory and collapse about giggling without any effort. They shared history,
music, friends, senses of humour. But once when Joan
tried to recount to her boyfriend an amusing thing that had happened to them
all in Key West back when Jamie was a toddler, the guy just gawped at her.

For a while, sex with him had been great.
But he didn�t know the jokes. 

Now, lying in this strange hotel bed
across the Atlantic, Kelly was starting to understand what Joan meant.

&nbsp;

Kelly marry James ?
Divorced ?

For a moment Mart thought he�d misheard.
He kept his head in his hands, hoping he could control his tears but he
couldn�t. His worst fears had been realised. He�d been stupid to imagine otherwise.
He�d lost everything; wife, daughter, life, self respect.

�Look at me, Mart.�

He opened his fingers, wiping his eyes.

�I have one final bit of news.�

He watched her take another sip of tea,
evidently enjoying the moment.

�Kelly gave you to me � for keeps.�

He stared at her. A huge thumping pounded
his chest.

�Unless you�d rather be out on the
street, penniless ?�

&nbsp;

The next afternoon, James kissed Simone
goodbye outside the deli after their quick lunch �a deux�.

�See you in Chicago.�

His young, long suffering girlfriend
pouted. �Not tonight ?�

�Nope. She might get suspicious. Can�t take any risks
darling.�

He took a Yellow cab back to the Mercer
and walked to the Reception for his key.

�Any messages ?�

The clerk handed him a note. It was from
Kelly. Short and to the point.

�Do not come after me.�

Five Words !

James scowled and crushed the note into a
tiny paper ball.

Damn ! Time to revert to Plan B.

&nbsp;

Kelly sat in the airline
lounge and dialled her daughter Chantal to say she�d be arriving in LA a day
early. Then she called Ingrid.

�Hi. It�s me, Kel.�

�Hi !
How�s things over there ? All still going well ?�

�Er
� fine. Just changing plans a little. How are things
your end ?�

�Great. We�re getting along
fine too. Mart�s well. He was a bit upset to start with but � you know. He�s
coming round. You never told me how much fun having somebody like him about
could be !�

�Didn�t I
?� Kelly bit her lip. �I�m thinking of cutting the trip short.�

�Oh ?
You don�t want to do that. Have fun ! Enjoy those
Hawaiian nights with your man.�

�Er � umm. So things are fine with you
?�

Kelly figured she could
extend her stay in LA a bit.

�Absolutely. Getting better all the time. I�m doing as you asked. Pushing things.�

�Shall I have a quick word
with him ?�

�He�s busy, Kel. To be honest I think it might throw him if he speaks
to you so soon. Why don�t you call us again in a few days ?�

A boarding announcement
drowned out further conversation.

�Okay then.� Kelly shouted.
�And Ingrid, er � thanks again.�

�A pleasure dear. Bye !�

&nbsp;

Ingrid clicked off the
phone.

Mart was kneeling
at her feet with a bowl of hot water, a pedicure set, cream and nail varnish. He had
kissed and sucked each of her toes in turn. Now he was washing, clipping,
filing and creaming them. Finally he would paint each one. Throughout her
conversation with Kelly, his head had remained lowered.

She was naked but for her
towelling robe hanging open. She felt more comfortable being naked with him
now. Her breasts were visible and her thighs parted. She could tell, with satisfaction,
the effect her nudity had on him.

�I think you should write to
Kelly and James.�

He looked up.

�She�s obviously a bit
concerned about you. You should write and reassure her. Tell her you�re
thrilled for her. Thank him for making her happy. And tell them that you would
like to stay with me after they�ve returned. It�s all sorted. Yes ?�

She studied him. Slowly he
nodded, turning back to her little toe.

�I will dictate. You just
write.�

She lapsed into silence.

In truth, she was disquieted
by her conversation with Kelly. Not exactly as enthusiastic
as she�d hoped. Still, she�d continue with her plan. The next few days
would be crucial. Perhaps she might even fuck him ? Just once. Just to bait the hook. Who knows, she might even
enjoy it. Her random blend of regular abuse and occasional kindness was
designed to break Mart�s resolve. He would face a choice between staying but
being abused, or leaving and losing everything. 

&nbsp;

�You remember Will ?� Ingrid said.

Mart curtseyed. He
remembered him from the dinner party when he was first �outed�.

Five days had passed since
the terrible morning when he�d learned he was divorced. Five
more difficult days of chores and ordeals, petty humiliations and unpleasant
tasks. He�d barely slept and had felt light headed, unable to get used
to the idea of a future like this.

When had it all spun out of control ?

What was that phrase; �power
corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely�. Essentially
saying that a person�s sense of morality lessens as his or her power increases.

He�d given Kelly absolute
power. She�d handed Ingrid absolute power. And they�d used it to fuck his life.
The truth was that Ingrid was exciting in a professional Fem Domme kind of way. Pay her by the hour and she�d offer any
sub male punter value for money.

But there was no
romance, no eros, no love, like there had been with
Kelly in those early months.

And now he�d lost the love
of his life forever.

&nbsp;

Mart stood to attention,
wrists crossed behind his back, as Ingrid flexed the plastic 12 inch ruler.
Will and Lou sat of the sofa watching, interested.

Outside, wet snowflakes had
started to fall, although they weren�t sticking on the ground. There were just
13 days to Christmas.

�Sing us a carol.� Ingrid
chuckled. �O come all ye faithful ! Rather an ironic
choice, but I like that one.�

Mart started to sing.

They all smiled at his
embarrassment.

After the first line, Ingrid
lashed the ruler across his bruised, scabbed, sore erection.

He whimpered. �J � joyful
and tr � iumphant ��

She thrashed him again. It
landed with a hot splat across his throbbing vein, making his penis bounce. A
previous cut had opened and was weeping.

�O come ye, o c � come ye,
to B ��

He howled,
doubling over, as the plastic slapped him in the balls. Somehow he managed to
control his hands from tearing the ruler out of her grip.

She waited patiently, blue
eyes on him, as he got his breath back.

�Come and behold �� he
gasped.

A piercing doorbell rent the
air, saving him from more pain, at least for a moment. Ingrid shrugged and carefully
placed the ruler down, making it clear she hadn�t finished with it.

�Excuse me a moment
everybody. Won�t be long.�

He watched her rise, heard
the echo of her heels going to the front door.

Will and Lou ignored him,
chatting quietly together.

A wave of nausea caught in
his throat. He realised just how much he dreaded the clack, clack of her
heels returning in a few moments.

And then the most extraordinary thing
happened.

Kelly burst into the room.
She looked amazing. A bit tired but beautiful, dressed in a
stunning winter coat, eyes blazing with anger.

�What the fuck is this ?� she snapped.

FIVE WORDS



Part Seven: January


�Ten � nine � eight � seven ��
The party heaved with two dozen chanting, flushed faces, smiling around at each other.
�� six � five � four ��
But Mart stared intently at Kelly. His green eyes solely on her.
�� three � two � one ��
Then a great, communal cry went up.
�Happy New Year !!!!�
She blew a kiss at him, then turned and hugged the people either side of her. The chimes of Big Ben ringing in 2007 were broadcast over the speakers.
Finally, she turned back to him. He hugged her.
�Happy New Year.� He murmured. His hot breath tickled her ear.
�I&#8217;m still mulling over your offer you know.�
They smiled at each other. Every New Year she whispered those words.
�And ?�
She stared back into his emerald eyes. This time was for keeps.
�Go to the bathroom and lock yourself back into your CB.�
He shut his eyes, drew a long breath. Then opened them again, sparkling.
�Yes � Mistress.�

The past three weeks hadn&#8217;t been easy. In the days after her return from LA, both she and Mart had needed time. They lived in the same house but weren&#8217;t mentally in the same space. She wasn&#8217;t interested in him or in domination. She pretty much let him do as he liked. He watched TV, played golf with Dylan, even jerked himself off for all she knew. His genitals had slowly recovered from their mistreatment at Ingrid&#8217;s hands.
It had been Kelly&#8217;s idea to invite Chantal and Greg over from LA for Christmas. Their visit had lifted Mart&#8217;s spirits and thawed out the winter atmosphere. After a bit too much turkey and pudding on Christmas Day, they had lain in bed together that night and &#8216;opened up&#8217; to each other.

�It just wasn&#8217;t what I wanted.� He said. �I don&#8217;t want a Fem Domme hooker-type. It&#8217;s you I want. Domination and control by you.�
She grinned a little sheepishly.
�I think we both learned something. The past four weeks were necessary, in a strange way.�
�Can I ask, what did you learn ?�
She shrugged. It was a question she&#8217;d asked herself a lot.
�I now have a much clearer idea of what I want from our � situation. I realised that I still love you Mart. I guess deep down, I was frightened when this all began that it would inevitably lead to our separation, in the end. I didn&#8217;t know if it would take five days, five months or five years, but I feared I would be unable to stop myself � you know, no longer respecting you.�
He looked at her. A hint of hurt in his eyes, but silent, patient.
�I guess I confused lust with love too. But I discovered that part of my satisfaction comes from you being mostly around. Sure, I enjoyed ��
She paused to brush his cheek, stalling on the word.
� � fucking with James. And Alain. But I like fucking with your mind too.�
He nodded solemnly, then broke into a wry grin.
�I&#8217;m sorry. I wish I was � you know � different.�
�But you are who you are Mart. So am I. Neither of us can change that. That&#8217;s why I can still respect you. After all, it&#8217;s as much part of you as your loveable green eyes and � this.�
She smirked, touching his penis for the first time in weeks. But her fingers didn&#8217;t linger on it. Instead, the two of them just lay silently for a while, listening to their heartbeats.
�What else ?� he asked, finally.
�What else ? Mmm. I realised that there are lots of things left for us to try you know. I held back. It&#8217;s the one thing Ingrid was right about. I need to take us further. To have total control. To indulge all my wicked fantasies. That&#8217;s a condition if we are going to continue.�
She raised an eyebrow, questioning him with her gaze.
�What do you think Mart ? Carry on � or are you too afraid ?�
He bit his lower lip. �The only thing I&#8217;m afraid of is how I&#8217;d feel if I lost you.�
She leaned over and kissed him.
�Well, you&#8217;ve nothing to be afraid of then.�

They both took Chantal and Greg to the airport. In the car on the journey home, they agreed that midnight on New Year&#8217;s Eve would mark the starting point.
He felt strange at Naomi and Nick&#8217;s annual party. Most of the people there knew the situation. They asked him politely about Christmas, about Chantal, small talk about the weather and politics, told the occasional joke. Yet he could tell they were all looking at him and wondering. He&#8217;d known several of them for twenty-plus years. Studied, socialised and worked with them. He&#8217;d been to their weddings and they&#8217;d been to his. They knew he had been his wife&#8217;s slave.
And all the time the clocks were ticking towards midnight.

In the bathroom, he removed his steel Gerecke and placed it round his dick.
Bye bye, old chap. He whispered, turning the key in the lock.
He and Kelly had made love twice in the week since Christmas. They&#8217;d been gentle and loving, missionary sessions. Not wild fucking bouts. They were to bond the two of them together again. But he&#8217;d been disappointed when she hadn&#8217;t climaxed either time. He&#8217;d tried to get her to let him use his fingers or mouth to finish her afterwards but she wasn&#8217;t interested.
Her time would come, she&#8217;d said, winking at the double-entendre.
Somehow he&#8217;d resisted masturbating himself since, even though he knew it might be a long time before she let him cum again.
He hid the key in the palm of his closed hand and walked out the bathroom.
The interval was over. It was time for Act Two.

�Quiet please.� Naomi called out, turning down the background music.
It was half past midnight.
The remaining twenty or so people slowly ceased talking.
�Kelly has a little announcement to make.�
She smiled at the expectant faces. She&#8217;d rehearsed these words.
�Hi, everybody. Happy New Year again.�
They all mumbled &#8216;Happy New Year Kelly&#8217; back to her.
She flicked her brunette hair away from her eyes and struck her most confident, sexy pose; hands on hips, one knee cocked, tits thrust out, lips in a &#8216;come hither&#8217; pout.
�I guess it&#8217;s the world&#8217;s worst kept secret that, for the past few months, Mart and I have had a � pretty strange arrangement going on.�
She gave them a little self-conscious grin and several friends broke eye contact with her too. Awkwardness all round.
�Well the reason I wanted to say something is to avoid any embarrassment from now on. Please feel free to be open about it. We&#8217;d just rather you all keep it from our mums !�
There was a titter of laughter.
�Seriously, I would ask you all to be discreet. Especially those of you who know Chantal. But amongst all of us, be as open and blunt as you like.�
�Do you want to have sex with me, Kel ?� a man&#8217;s voice called out.
Yuk. Simon. Single Simon. Single for a reason.
She smiled sweetly. �That was blunt.� She replied. �So I&#8217;ll be blunt. No, I don&#8217;t want sex with you Simon. That&#8217;s not how this works.� A couple of people winked at her encouragingly.
�The point is this, folks. From this moment onwards, Mart is my slave. That&#8217;s not a politically correct word but I can&#8217;t think of a more accurate one. If you can&#8217;t handle that, then I&#8217;d like to thank you for being such good friends up to now but I guess this is goodbye. However, if you would like to remain friends with me, but see Mart only in his new role, I&#8217;d be very pleased to continue all our friendships. Thank you very much.�
�Hear hear.� Nick called out excitedly. Kelly smiled at him in thanks.
�I&#8217;m in.� somebody added.
�Me too.� another chimed. She thought it was Jack.
Gradually the entire room endorsed her speech.
�We&#8217;re right behind you sister.� Naomi whispered, hugging her.
Kelly glanced at Mart standing aloof, watching them all. Her slave.

2nd January 2007 was a Tuesday and the start of normal business after the long European break for the Christmas holidays.
The delivery van arrived before nine o&#8217;clock.
Two men in blue overalls with clipboards unloaded several wooden crates. The tallest boxes were over 7 feet long, the largest 6 feet square. Kelly made the guys coffee while Mart helped them heave everything upstairs.
It was her new bed. A very special double bed from a specialist website. She&#8217;d actually ordered it six weeks earlier, before going to USA with James. Her Christmas present to herself.
It wasn&#8217;t going to be wasted after all.
It was made of rosewood, beautifully rich and polished. It was a four poster but without a canopy. The wooden corner posts tapered to carved points at the 6 feet high tips, like ornate spears. The sides and ends of the bed were solid and panelled, so you couldn&#8217;t see under it. The luxury mattress was top of the range, thick, hand-sewn and fully supporting.
After the delivery men had removed her old bed, assembled the new one, and left, while Mart was downstairs washing up, she checked the mechanism. A hidden motor whirred and the base began to rise from the bottom end, lifting the mattress with it up to 45 degrees.
She peered into the space below. There was a second thin mattress on the floor, with four fastening cuffs in the corners. Mart could be tied down there all night, under her mattress. Or all day.
Or both.

In the final, unopened box was something else. She fetched her nail scissors and cut the tapes, heartbeat running a bit fast. This was maybe going a bit far but the photo on the website had triggered a morbid fascination in her. Her very own portable queening and toilet seat !
It was made of smooth, rigid plastic in an attractive cream colour.
It was basically a sitting stool like an adult-sized child&#8217;s potty; there was a padded toilet seat that lifted, a plastic container and base, and a neck hole in the front. The neck hole opened like the two halves of a pillory to lock the wearer&#8217;s head in place, as he lay down face-up on the floor.
She had chosen the &#8216;relaxation&#8217; model. There was a separate strip of sturdy plastic that she slid into grooves in the back of the stool until it clicked and locked into position. This formed a back support to give her greater comfort as she sat on the stool.
Kelly placed it on the ground and squatted down. She giggled, imagining seeing Mart lying there in front of her, or maybe tied down in position.
Time for a cup of expresso.

Mart was finishing washing up the previous night&#8217;s dinner. They had taken New Year&#8217;s Day slowly, getting used to the Mistress-slave deal again. After dinner, she&#8217;d had him bathe, massage and tongue her.
�I can&#8217;t decide whether to find another job for you.� She mused.
He nodded, evidently making clear the decision was entirely hers. He was dressed in shorts, tight top and an apron.
�Or whether you should start up another company ?�
She sat at the kitchen table with an exaggerated sigh.
�Decisions, decisions ! Make me an expresso. Then call Naomi and invite her for lunch. Then go upstairs and make up my new bed with those new cotton sheets that Chantal gave us for Christmas. Then prepare a chicken salad for lunch, for two if Nao&#8217; can come. Then do the usual housework checklist. Make sure you clean out all my lingerie and handwash it. A month has gone by since you last laundered it.�
She accepted the cup of expresso without a word. It was important not to thank or acknowledge him. She sipped it in silence, listening to Mart on the phone, hearing Naomi saying yes to lunch.

Half an hour later, she found him tidying up her clothes and hanging them in the closet.
�Come.� She said, curling her finger.
She pointed at the cream plastic toilet seat on her tiled, bathroom floor.
�Put that on round your neck.�
Mart&#8217;s face turned white but he obeyed. He opened the collar and then closed it, with the round toilet seat in front of his face. There was a thin plastic ruff round the edge to make the collar watertight.
�Lie down there.�
She watched him lay down, like a deep sea diver in his &#8216;helmet&#8217;.
�Mart �� she peered into the hole, �� I know we&#8217;ve done some of this before. You asked what have I learned. The answer is that one of the things I enjoy a lot is � this.�
He looked up at her. His even gaze indicated agreement. Or at least acceptance.
She removed her thong and flipped up the hem of her skirt, so that it fell daintily around her as she sat down. She relaxed her back against the support.
It was a little low and awkward, but perfectly comfortable.
�Lick my bum, Mart.� She said, loud enough for him to hear.
Moments later she felt a lovely liquid chill ripple through her as Mart&#8217;s tongue slid into her rim. She let her weight sink into the seat, spreading her buttocks just a bit wider.
She could already visualise herself watching TV or a movie like this in the evening. Sitting on her stool with a drink, some chocs and the phone to hand, without any need to go anywhere to take a break. 
She passed gas silently. Mart carried on licking without a discernible break. It amused her that, with her butt causing one tight seal and then her skirt adding a secondary defence, she had no idea whether or not her flatulence had been smelly. Oh well, who cared ? Not her.
Her bladder squeaked for relief and so she ceased teasing herself and let rip, trying to imagine the scene below. The website blurb about the plastic container claimed it had a four pints capacity on top of space required for an average adult head.
She counted to forty five seconds. Two morning cups of tea and a dark, bitter expresso, along with a glass of grapefruit juice and probably some of last night&#8217;s tannic red wine.
Mmm �
Mart&#8217;s body lay still on the tiled floor between her legs. She could see from his chest that he was gulping and deep breathing. When her flow had stopped, she felt his damp tongue burrowing into her anus again.
Her tummy rumbled and she felt a second ripple of wind. This time she pushed, so that it popped out noisily, not silently. She heard a slight moan but his tongue kept twirling in obedient circles inside her.
She was tempted. But now was too soon.
Of all her resentment at Ingrid&#8217;s mistreatment of Mart, it was that particular disrespect that most upset her. She hadn&#8217;t expected somebody to go beyond the realms of decency. It was all very well for people to behave as they liked with their own property but not with borrowed possessions. She felt as if somebody had asked to use her bathroom and left it in a disgusting state.
She reached out to the toilet tissue and pulled off a sheet, then raised her hips and wiped her pussy dry. She threw the tissue into the &#8216;pan&#8217;.
Mart&#8217;s face was drenched. He blinked up at her like a drowning man peering through a submarine window.
She chuckled. �Okay there, Mart ?�
He sort-of nodded his head.
�Did you miss my wee-wee ?�
He made a face and mumbled a reply.
�Go get cleaned up and make sure you decant that piss. Your cellar&#8217;s run dry.�
After he&#8217;d left the room, she sat on the proper toilet and emptied her bowels. She let her mind wander as she sat there. Why are we like we are ? What is it in our genes or upbringing or lives that allows some of us to be perfectly satisfied with roses and champagne and vanilla lovemaking, and causes others to long for thorns and urine and � sadomasochism ?

�Nice lunch.�
Mart topped up Naomi&#8217;s glass. She glanced up at him. He&#8217;d actually known her longer than he&#8217;d known Kelly. She&#8217;d introduced them both.
Kelly disdainfully pushed her unfinished plate away. �What does Nick think ?�
�Nick ?�
�Yeah. About us. Me and Mart.�
�He&#8217;s cool. I mean, he&#8217;s fascinated, you know. Though he pretends not to be.�
�He ever been into anything kinky ? You guys ever played ?�
Mart stood busily at the kitchen sink, pretending not to listen.
�Funnily enough �� Naomi tittered shyly, �� until recently I&#8217;d have called him the straightest man I know. But � since we&#8217;ve known about you two, he&#8217;s � well � asked me to try some stuff.�
�No ! What kind of stuff ?�
�Oh nothing like you. But tying him up. Maybe spanking him. I can&#8217;t say. I&#8217;m embarrassed.�
�Don&#8217;t be embarrassed ! I mean, we&#8217;re hardly ones to judge. So � go on.�
There was a pause. Mart put away the olive oil and balsamic.
�Well, we&#8217;ve tried. But I&#8217;m not very good. I&#8217;m not dominant like you.�
�Hah. I didn&#8217;t think I was either. Mart !�
He turned round and walked to the table.
�Take everything off, now !�
He undressed as fast as he could. Kelly and Naomi watched him. Naomi&#8217;s pale blue eyes didn&#8217;t flinch. She had a tousled nest of light strawberry hair, freckles and small, pert tits.
�What&#8217;s Nick into ?� Kelly asked, while he removed his briefs, naked but for his steel tube.
�I&#8217;m not sure yet. But he&#8217;s asked me to try whacking him with a hairbrush.�
�And ?�
�I don&#8217;t think I did it very well. He said I didn&#8217;t really hit him.�
�You need to practice, my dear.�

Mart was bent over naked, clutching his ankles.
Kelly&#8217;s hands played around with his buttocks, fingertips opening up his rectum. He felt the air tickle his exposed bottom.
�What&#8217;s that for ?� Naomi&#8217;s voice enquired.
�Oh, just inspecting. One of the numerous advantages of having a submissive man is that you don&#8217;t have to put up with all those nasty male habits. You know, poor hygiene, dirty underpants, unshaved stubble.�
�You check his ass ?�
�Sure I do.�
Mart cringed, his face hot as he stared at the floor.
�And I like to watch him on the toilet.� Kelly added, probing with a fingernail. �No more long, leisurely visits to the bathroom for him ! He can be putting that time saved to better use doing things for me.�
Naomi burst out laughing. �I have a lot to learn !�
�You sure do. Now, before you pick up that hairbrush, a few comments.�
Mart felt Kelly&#8217;s familiar hand run down his spine firmly.
�First, get comfortable. You need to be able to swing your arm and carry on as long as necessary. Okay ? Good. Make sure you can rotate your body for extra force. Next, move him into position. Push his back down so his butt&#8217;s in exactly the right place for you. You want it fully presented, open.�
Naomi&#8217;s foot inserted itself between Mart&#8217;s legs, opening them further.
�Excellent.� Kelly said. �Take the initiative. You need his balls and anus on show. Check his cheeks are nicely stretched, that way he can&#8217;t clench and you&#8217;ll have a juicy, bouncy target. It&#8217;s actually kinder because it hurts more, so you don&#8217;t have to thrash so hard and risk doing any real damage.�
Kelly&#8217;s hand pushed the back of his head so he was bent right down to his feet. He looked up through his legs and saw Naomi&#8217;s concentrated, impish stare.
�I like him to watch me throughout and count. If I&#8217;m in the mood, I sometimes thank me as well.�
The pale blue eyes, freckles and white teeth curled into an amused grin.
�This is more fun than when I tried with Nick.�
�Good.� Kelly replied. �Okay now you take up your final position. You want to be just a bit behind his butt, at a right angle. Make sure you&#8217;re comfortable again and check his position. Get him to move if necessary. And if he shifts during the spanking, or if he stops looking up at you, wait and make sure he assumes the correct position again. Be absolutely fastidious. Now � ready ?�
�As I&#8217;ll ever be.� Naomi replied.
�Then I suggest you start with twenty.�
Twenty !
�Twenty !� Naomi exclaimed. �That many ?�
Kelly had never given him more than twelve before.
�You need to build up your spanking strength.�
�But ��
Through his legs, Mart could see Naomi had put her hand to her mouth. Nevertheless, she was actually smiling, eyes wide.
��what about him ?�
�Mart ? He needs to build up his spanking strength too.�
He watched Naomi raise the brush and then thwack it down onto his butt.
A nasty hot smack zinged across his cheeks.
�One. Er, thank you � Ms. Naomi.� Mart stammered out. He blinked in shock but immediately forced his eyes back open. 
�I think I know what Nick meant.� Kelly said. �Do it harder, Nao.�
A second, nastier, hotter blow splattered his backside.
�Ahhss �� he hissed. �T � two. Thank you � Ms. Naomi.�
He always hated the first few. The end seemed so far away.
Three. On the other cheek.
Four. Bang on top of number three.
Five. A low one that caught the tender underside of his globes.
Six. Another where three and four hand landed.
His eyes watered. Breath uneven. He gasped out the count and thanks.
�Hold it.� Kelly called out. �His head&#8217;s risen up.�
Naomi&#8217;s empty hand pushed him back down to the floor. She trailed her fingers back over his hot flesh, lingering over the sweet spots.
�More wine ?� Kelly asked.
�Mm, please. It&#8217;s hard work.�
�Nobody said keeping a male slave is easy.�
They both laughed, relaxing with each other. He heard them clinking glasses, drinking. He screwed his eyes shut to stifle their wetness and then looked up at her.
Then swats seven through twelve followed in painful succession.
�Tw � twelve. Thank you � Ms. N � Naomi.�
�He&#8217;s crying.�
�Oh I&#8217;ve seen Mart cry many times. Don&#8217;t be put off. He&#8217;ll be fine. That&#8217;s part of the game. If he doesn&#8217;t cry it&#8217;s usually because it&#8217;s too mild.�
�Phew. I need another break. And a drink.�
�Sure. Come through to the other room. Mart&#8217;s not going anywhere !�

He guessed five minutes passed before they returned. He&#8217;d stayed exactly where he was, absorbing the stages of pain as they evolved through the sharp stinging to the build up of heat throughout his bottom and pelvic area, to the throbbing hum of soreness in the nerve endings. Worse was knowing that it was by no means over. New layers would be added.
They were laughing aloud when they returned, but no longer talking. He briefly wondered what had amused them so much.
Upside down, he watched Naomi take up her position like a seasoned pro. She winked, then pushed down on his tail, stretching his cheeks.
Thirteen. Unlucky. The tip of the brush caught the back of his scrotum.
Fourteen. Fifteen. Sixteen. Seventeen. Eighteen. Nineteen.
He was snivelling properly now, although he tried to hide it.
Naomi paused. �Last one.� He heard her say, a tinge of regret in her voice. She had an almost feline expression he&#8217;d seen on Kelly&#8217;s face a few times. He imagined it was how a cat must look playing with a mouse; amused but ruthless, intrigued but detached.
�Why ?� Kelly asked.
�You said twenty.�
�I said start with twenty !�
The twentieth blow blistered his upturned, flaming backside.
�Aaaggh.� He howled. �Tw � enty. Th � thank you, Ms. Naomi.�

Kelly walked out to Naomi&#8217;s car with her.
�Give it a try with Nick, yeah ?�
Naomi looked up at her out of the car window.
�I don&#8217;t know ��
�Look, you don&#8217;t have to go the whole nine yards.� She giggled. �Just five !�
Naomi jammed the keys into the ignition.
�I&#8217;ll talk it through with him. Seriously. No promises.�
Kelly nodded. �Just think � we could � you know, get together !�
Naomi gunned the engine, rolling her eyes. �If I&#8217;d known you were going to grow up into such a kinky gal, Kel&#8217;, I&#8217;d have never spoken to you when we were eleven years old !�

�Come here.� She said.
Mart was hanging up her lingerie to dry indoors; thongs, strings, briefs, knickers, slips, suspenders, hold-ups, fishnets, waspies, bras, quarter-cups, half-cups, a corset; in black, white, cream, red and black/red trim; in cotton, lace, satins and silks. A harlot&#8217;s wardrobe.
He put down the laundry basket and knelt by her chair.
�Kiss me.�
He puckered his lips and they both kissed warmly. Not tongues, but a full union of the lips.
Kelly smiled at him. �I want you to make love to me this evening.�
He inhaled slowly. �Of � course.�
�I&#8217;m going to give you a chance, Mart. If you can satisfy me, properly, then my dangerous liaisons are over. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;d prefer.�
She stared into his eyes, reading them.
�Is that what you&#8217;d prefer too, Mart ?�
He dry swallowed. You live with somebody two decades, you can tell.
�Why, Mart ? Why do you want me to � fuck other men ?�
He lowered his head.
She put her finger under his chin and raised his face. There were tears in his eyes. He screwed them shut tight.
�I don&#8217;t want you to f � fuck other men.� He whispered bitterly.
Kelly cupped his cheek tenderly, wiped a stray tear away.
�What do you want ?�
�What&#8217;s best for you.�
�No Mart. That&#8217;s not it. What&#8217;s best for me is you. I know that now. What you want is what&#8217;s best for you. Isn&#8217;t it ?�
He shook his head in sorrow. �For b � both of us � I guess.�
�I can&#8217;t do it like that. Not just to please you. It has to be my way. Or not at all.�
�What is your way ?�
She smiled, cocking her head. �Your friends � our friends.�
He frowned. �What �?�
�I don&#8217;t want strangers like James. Guys I don&#8217;t know and can&#8217;t trust. I&#8217;ve been there and done that, Mart. No, there are at least two, maybe more, male friends and acquaintances we know who I � well, to be blunt, I could see myself having fun with. Now that our situation is fully out in the open, I would prefer them to another James or Alain.�
She studied him. This was important.
She felt like she was on a rollercoaster. At the start, she had ridden the upslope and then raced down the first half of the track, all whoops and hollers and swooping curves and plunging dips. But now, she had reached the point where the ride slows and ascends again, another ratcheted incline to the high point of the entire rollercoaster. The moment when you glance at the entire amusement park laid out below; other rides, arcades and foodstands, people as tiny specks. And suddenly you realise you have crested the peak and you&#8217;re off again, no way back, plunging heart in your mouth, down into the fearsome second part of the track �
�Who � ?�
Kelly shook her head. �It doesn&#8217;t work like that. I&#8217;m not agreeing rules with you. What, who, when or where. Frankly that&#8217;s all up to me. I may not even tell you. Certainly at the start � if at all. I shall probably have affairs, Mart. Secret liaisons. It won&#8217;t be deceitful. Because I&#8217;m telling you now, up front, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll be doing. Sometimes you&#8217;ll probably taste him, or them, on me, but you won&#8217;t know which of our buddies is shagging me until I&#8217;m good and ready to tell you.�
She dabbed another salty teardrop away.
�As big Frank sang, I&#8217;ll do it my way.�
Mart gazed and then, very slowly, lowered his head in acceptance.
�Is that what you want ?�
�� yes.� He whispered.
�And you want me to keep you in long term chastity while I do it ?�
�� yes.�
She smiled over the top of his head. She felt a tinge of sadness. They had had the opportunity to try a different sort of relationship. A more � romantic one. The elusive damsel and her devoted knight. The exotic queen and her muscular servant. But it was not to be. In spite of all that had happened over the past six months, it was the vicious harlot and the abused jester that, unfortunately, Mart truly, madly, deeply preferred.
And, alas, so did she.
Five very bad, slightly mad � sad but true words.


This is not the end of Part Seven
It will be updated with the second half in a few days time
&#8216;Rabbit 1, with thanks &#8211; Rest in Peace&#8217;



The Big John Dong Vibrator was black, sculpted and comfortably large.
Kelly lay back, spine arched, red nails gripping her pillow, as Mart concentrated on bringing her up to a second, shattering climax. He ploughed the glistening, vibrating dildo deep into her, then eased it out slowly, until the rim of the crown touched his wife&#8217;s engorged labia.
He was crouched between her legs, his face only inches from her sex, studying her responses, hearing, smelling, seeing everything. But only focused on her pleasure.
Both of them were entirely focused on her pleasure.
Mart was irrelevant, except as an operative. His own equipment throbbed uncomfortably in its confining, unyielding steel tube. He did his best to disregard it, his mind solely fixed on what he was doing, although the nagging pulse in his own groin was impossible to ignore completely.
He moved his head up to flick his tongue at her clitoris then plunged the vibe in again.
�Yessss �� Kelly hissed. �Nggah � nearly ��
He quickened the pace, in, out, in out, deeper, deeper, until the full length was inside her sucking flesh.
�Yes � James� Yesssssssss ��
She bucked her hips, her legs extending to their full length, toes curling, in another gut-wrenching orgasm. Mart marvelled at Kelly&#8217;s ability to lose herself completely in the moment. The demure girl he&#8217;d married twenty years before no longer existed. The brash woman in her place enjoyed a climax that appeared to last for around ten, long seconds.
He waited, holding &#8216;James&#8217; still inside her, letting her come down.
The scent was different from normal sex. Much more floral and feminine. There was no tang of mingling fluids of the male and female. Just hers.
�Phew �� she exhaled. �I needed that. Mmm ��
He waited until she peered down at him.
�That&#8217;s enough. You can clean James now.�
It had been her teasing idea to call her new vibrator James. Big, black and brainless, she joked, just like her ex-boyfriend. And a nice reminder for Mart.
He switched off the vibrations, slid it from her, and sucked the jelly rubber dick into his mouth. It was too large to be comfortable.
�Deeper.� She said. �Until you gag.�
He pushed until the crown nudged his throat, making him choke.
She smiled. �Now you know why I never got off on doing that to you.�
He continued licking, slobbering.
�Enough.� She said, tiring of the game.
He cleaned it properly, dried and put it away in his bedside stand. Then he brushed his teeth quickly in the bathroom and began to climb back into bed alongside her.
She shook her head, getting up off the bed.
�From now on, Mart, you sleep here.�
He watched her lean down to press a hidden dial. There was a whirring motor sound and, at the foot of the bed, the mattress started rising. It stopped at 45 degrees.
�Climb in.� she said.
He looked at her, then peered into the void created below the mattress and her thick, fluffy comforter-duvet.
His own mattress felt thin to the touch, plastic and uncovered. He lay down tentatively.
�Wrists in the cuffs.�
One by one, he put his hands through the loops. She pushed the dial and they automatically tightened round his wrists then pulled his arms taut into the corners of the space.
�Sleep tight.�
Moments later, there was a whirring sound and he watched the bed descend, the light diminishing to a sliver and then � pitch black.

Each day new packages and envelopes arrived, and the following morning was no exception. Kelly smiled at one envelope. Through the clear window she could see the tickets. She hid it safe in her pocket.
There was also a large box with a garish label.
She sat at the table drinking a cup of fresh mint tea.
�Open it.�
Mart unwrapped the box and pulled out a white, plasticated bundle. She smiled at his expression of vague bemusement.
Adult diapers !
�I used to find you asking me whether you could use the toilet all the time tiresome.� She told him. �So I thought these would solve the problem.�
He looked at her, his lips opening as if to say the word &#8216;b � ut&#8217;.
�But what, Mart ? But that&#8217;s not one of your fantasies ? I couldn&#8217;t give a damn, frankly. You&#8217;ll wear them whenever I say.�
That afternoon, she fed him a huge bowl of cold tinned beans, raisins and pasta, washed down with several large glasses of prune juice. By the evening, he had already asked her twice for permission to use the bathroom.
Both times permission was denied.
At 7.30 p.m., as soon as he&#8217;d finished preparing her supper, she took him upstairs to her bedroom.
�For a while, we&#8217;re going to put you on an &#8216;early to bed&#8217; routine. I&#8217;ve got some socialising to do. I want you out of the way. And you&#8217;ve got some training to undergo. So, brush your teeth and undress.�
She opened up a diaper and spread it out on the bed.
He lay down while she unlocked his Gerecke tube and then folded the diaper, sticking it into position. She tapped him when she&#8217;d finished.
�Let me be clear, Mart. This isn&#8217;t about filling your diaper. Far from it. Do that and I&#8217;ll be livid. It&#8217;s about control. The diaper&#8217;s only there in case you lose it. Is that perfectly clear ?�
He looked up at her, wide-eyed. Very slowly he nodded agreement.
Kelly gave an approving chuckle.
It would be interesting. She didn&#8217;t think he had a chance. Mart had been regular as clockwork as long as she&#8217;d known him. Every morning and most evenings his bowels had moved. It would be fascinating to see if she could retrain him. Winner takes all. And she held all the aces.
Two minutes later, she&#8217;d closed the bed down for the night with Mart spreadeagled in the dark void below her mattress. She looked forward to sleeping well that night.
But first, she had something to do.

Mart lay in the dark. He knew it was only just gone seven thirty and he&#8217;d be stuck down here at least 12 hours, probably more like 13-14. He already felt bloated. His tummy was emitting those growls. Left to his own devices, he&#8217;d already be thinking about visiting the bathroom, if not exactly desperate to go there yet. He knew he was in deep shit.
For a moment he smiled wryly at the metaphor.
He farted loudly, enjoying the release of gas from his swollen stomach. Slowly the stench seeped out of the sealed diaper and into the void.
It was going to be a long, uncomfortable night.

Jack put the phone down with a mystified but happy grin.
He&#8217;d been separated a year now and his sex life hadn&#8217;t exactly been hopping. To be honest, he was still scared of any sort of commitment and the few single ladies around his age were the opposite. They wanted the full works, rings and wedding bells.
Until Kelly.
Wow. Talk about an offer out of the blue. He&#8217;d seen her at Nick&#8217;s on New Year&#8217;s Eve and she looked hot. Lost a few pounds, sexed up her image. Sure he&#8217;d heard the rumours. Years ago, he&#8217;d fancied her and he thought she liked him too, but it hadn&#8217;t gone anywhere. She met Mart and he met Joanne, his ex. Then the phone goes and she doesn&#8217;t beat around the bush. Pretty much serves herself up on a plate to him.
Just a few rules, she says.
Well, he can live with a few rules.

Kelly made a few more calls, drank a little too much wine, watched a movie, and it was after midnight by the time she got to bed. She sat on the toilet and flicked through the new issue of Vogue. Once in bed, she pulled out &#8216;James&#8217; and gave herself a nice, quick, &#8216;sleeping tablet climax&#8217;. Soon after, she was away with the fairies.

The bedside clock glowed 08.44 when she blinked at it next morning. A weak winter sun filtered through a gap in the curtains.
Eight solid hours. Mmm. She yawned and stretched her limbs.
It took a few moments for her to come round properly and be certain. The faint whiff in the air was unmistakeable.
His Low Flush beaten by her Four Aces !

She threw open the bedroom windows and slipped into her gown. Mart could stew in his juice for a while. She went down and poured herself a grapefruit juice, made an expresso. It felt good to have the place to herself in the morning, without Mart bumbling about doing chores.
It was crisp, cold outside, the sky a piercing blue. When Spring arrived she&#8217;d move him back out to the shed. Until then he could sometimes spend a few extra hours staked under the bed out of her way.
It was past midday when she opened it up and released him. The smell was mostly contained by the diaper. But she caught the distinctive ammoniac notes of urine along with the core fragrance of faeces.
�Out.� She said. �Clean up. Then ice cold shower.�
Ten minutes later, he was stood, chilled and shrivelled. She watched him fasten his Gerecke back on and dress in a new outfit she&#8217;d bought. 
�Now get on and prepare lunch.� She ordered, coldly. �For three of us, we have a guest, er � coming.� The innuendo hung heavy in the air, ripe with meaning.

�Looking good.� Jack said, his grey eyes eating her up.
�Feeling good.� She replied, pecking him on the cheek.
It was as normal a lunch as possible, considering one person was wearing a pink tutu with white stockings, ballet pumps and a pink bonnet. Especially as that person was male, 42 years old, and the husband of the hostess.
Mart served, cleared, but also ate with them. He listened and joined in the conversation when invited by Kelly.
�Please don&#8217;t burden us with loads of questions, Jack.� She said, once they&#8217;d sat down and started eating. �Just accept things the way they are.�
�Sure.� He beamed.
Kelly returned his smile encouragingly.
�As I said on the phone, I&#8217;m not looking for a boyfriend, a lover, a relationship. That doesn&#8217;t work. Not for me, anyway. I don&#8217;t want jealousy either. You see I&#8217;m looking for maybe more than one � guy at once.�
Jack hadn&#8217;t objected to anything she said so far. He just raised an eyebrow. His face was still ruggedly handsome, with an easy smile, strong jaw and a few lines round his eyes. He had self confidence but Kelly had always noticed his shyness with women. It was best if she took the initiative.
�I&#8217;m interested in you being my first guy, Jack. You know, if we both get on.�
�I&#8217;d � love to be.� He croaked, glancing at Mart.
�And Mart would love that too, wouldn&#8217;t you ?�
�Yes.� His voice was little more than a whisper.
There was silence for five seconds as they each digested the moment.
�Just so that we&#8217;re clear, Jack. I&#8217;m not looking for a Master for Mart. Or a Bull, I think people call them. Some guy trying to boss him or us around. As you can see ��
She gestured to Mart&#8217;s outfit and her empty glass. She waited while he rose and refilled hers, then Jack&#8217;s.
�� I am more than capable of bossing him around on my own.�
�To be honest, I&#8217;d prefer that. I don&#8217;t want to � humiliate my old mate.�
She chuckled. �Well, hopefully you will humiliate him. Just by being here. That&#8217;s what we both want, isn&#8217;t is Mart ?�
�Yes.�
�Do you remember when we met, Mart ? You didn&#8217;t like Jack at first, did you ? You thought he was &#8216;sniffing me like a dog&#8217;. Do you remember using that phrase back then ?�
�No ! Did he ?� Jack laughed.
�Yes.� Mart shrugged.
�Well, I think you should apologise. And then reassure Jack nicely that any time he&#8217;s here, your house, your things, your wife are his to enjoy.�
They both watched Mart dry-swallow, his adam&#8217;s apple bobbing.
�Er � sorry Jack.�
�No.� Kelly interrupted. �I know I said, no &#8216;Master stuff&#8217;. But I do think you should at least call him &#8216;Sir&#8217; from now on.�
She watched Mart cringe, a heat rash mottling his chest, the red merging with the pink of the tutu. It was January but a shine of perspiration glistened at his temples underneath the ridiculous Bo-Peep bonnet.
�I&#8217;m sorry, Sir. Please ��
Kelly leaned over and kissed Jack full on the mouth as her husband spoke. Jack responded, tentatively at first.
�� I er � feel free when you&#8217;re here. You know, to � help yourself.�
Kelly moaned as Jack&#8217;s tongue probed between her lips.
�I think you and I will take our coffee in the other room.�

Mart knocked timidly on the living room door. He was holding a tray with coffees, milk, sugar and some expensive chocolates.
�Enter.�
He saw Kelly separating from a kiss as he entered. Jack was flushed, a couple of his shirt buttons undone.
�Put it down on the table. Then leave us. I&#8217;ve left you a note on my desk.�
He laid down the tray and then curtseyed at her.
But she&#8217;d already turned back to suck Jack&#8217;s face.
He walked to the door.
�Mmuh �� he heard her breaking off again, �� er � leave the door ajar.�

He found the note, along with blank paper and five coloured crayons. They were next to a pink envelope, sealed and labelled &#8216;private&#8217;.
The note said, &#8216;Mart, while I get reacquainted with Jack, I want you to write out lines, using these pencils. You must write fast but neatly&#8217;.
my Darling Wife, i hope you are having a wonderful time with our old friend while I write this as a love letter to you.
&#8216;There are 25 words to a line. Use each colour alternately, one word at a time.&#8217;
He sighed and sat down.
He arranged the first sheet of paper in landscape format.
He picked up the blue crayon and wrote &#8216;my&#8217;.
Then he picked up the yellow and wrote &#8216;Darling&#8217;.
&#8216;Wife&#8217; in red.
&#8216;i&#8217; in pink.
&#8216;hope&#8217; in green.
And then &#8216;you&#8217; in blue.
He completed the first line and looked at it appraisingly.
Then started on the second.

He&#8217;d finished 18 lines when he first heard Kelly squeal.
It was a noise she never made with him. In the honest and open conversations they&#8217;d had over Christmas, she had admitted it was nothing to do with his skill at making love. Or even the other men. It was simply the situation. Yes, she said, in their way, Alain and James had been good, very good, studs but it was not the physical act that blew her mind. Instead, it was the mental thing going on in her head. In a strange way she felt she was still having sex with Mart, but using a surrogate partner. And some of the time she found that to be so much more exciting than actually doing it with Mart in person.
The truth ?
It was what he wanted to believe.
Yet not what he wanted to fantasise.
He cocked his ear, listening out for male noises, through the doorway.
Had Jack already cum&nbsp; ? Or was he about to ? Had she made him wear a condom ? He was a good bet for being STD free. They&#8217;d agreed that decision would always be Kelly&#8217;s. He couldn&#8217;t blank out the picture of his wife&#8217;s pussy swimming with cum, the bitter aftertaste of his &#8216;defeat&#8217; by another man. The telltale scent of fishy goings-on.
He realised he&#8217;d spent a minute without doing any lines.
He started writing as fast as he could trying to catch up.
A male shout of &#8216;yes&#8217; and a long groan answered his question.

Kelly lay back on the sofa exhausted and waved bye to Jack.
�Phew.� She said. �Get Mart to see you out. I&#8217;ll call you soon.�
�Great.� He blew a kiss at her. �Any time.�
She let her head fall back and shut her eyes.
In truth, it had gone even better than she hoped. Jack had taken her lead, not trying to get her to do things she didn&#8217;t want to. He&#8217;d been polite, sweet, but in good shape as well. All in all, a good fuck buddy. Above all, he was happy to be like her new vibrator.
Her &#8216;jack-in-the-box&#8217; !
She could take him out whenever she wanted to play.
�Mart !�
He appeared at the doorway, seconds later.
�Jack gone ?�
�Yes, Mistress.�
�Get down between my legs.�
She shut her eyes again and felt his hot breath on her.
�Lick me clean.�
His soft mouth nuzzled her sodden labia, tongue sliding inside.
�Don&#8217;t try to bring me off, Mart. Jack did that perfectly. Just clean me up.�

It was five thirty. He served her a cup of tea, showing her his lines:
Fifty four identical lines of 25 words in five colours.
my Darling Wife, i hope you are having a wonderful time with our old friend while I write this as a love letter to you.
She barely glanced at them, just dropped them disdainfully onto the tray.
�Yes, I did have a wonderful time. But I&#8217;m bored of sex and bdsm now.�
He looked at her, green eyes portraying confusion.
�Fetch the pink envelope from my desk.�
He came back with the sealed envelope labelled &#8216;private&#8217;.
�Open it.�
He fingered the flap open and pulled out two printed white cards.
Two tickets to the Rolling Stones concert.
She watched his eyes catching the time and date.
8.00 p.m. Today !
He looked at her, heart pumping. For twenty years they&#8217;d talked about seeing the Stones together. But due to one thing and another, never managed it.
She smiled.
�I think you&#8217;d better hurry and put some normal clothes on. We need to leave in fifteen minutes.�
He bit his lip. Obviously wondering if she was teasing ?
�M � me ?� he pointed his index finger at his chest.
�Of course, you Mart.� She replied softly. �Who the heck else do you think I&#8217;d rather see the Stones with, than my husband ?�
And their eyes locked in a stare of complete love and sudden understanding.


End of Part Seven
To be continued in Part Eight (February)









FIVE WORDS



Part Eight: February


Kelly sighed as she lay back in the deeply fragrant bath. She twiddled the hot tap to a halt with her toes, breathing in the aroma of lavender, jasmine and rose essential oils she&#8217;d mixed into the foaming water.
Life was good. She hadn&#8217;t been happier for as long as she could remember. It was good on so many levels. Chantal was settled in LA and embarked on her career. The worst of the English winter weather was over and the evenings were starting to get lighter again. She had found an idyllic house down in Portugal to become their second home. Above all, she and Mart had settled into a relationship that worked this time. Or seemed to work.
And yet, somehow she felt like she didn&#8217;t trust the script. It was like a movie where the &#8216;happy music&#8217; and &#8216;sunset shot&#8217; had come too early. You look at your watch and realise that there&#8217;s still a half hour to go until the end. And you figure surely the story can&#8217;t keep going that long with everybody smiling and happy. Sometime soon the creepy music will cut in once more and the camera angle will shift to reveal the shadow of an axe murderer standing, watching, waiting.
She disturbed the water with her hands so that it rippled up into her cleavage, the heat stimulating her breasts. The oils were reputedly aphrodisiac. Rose petals have long been used as confetti and to adorn lovers&#8217; beds to encourage romance. She admired her boobs. Pretty good for almost 39 and a mom ! She&#8217;d lost a few pounds these past few months but all of them off her tum and bum. If anything she looked a bit fuller up top. She felt comfortable with other people seeing her naked. Her nipples had begun to harden with arousal.
Tonight was going to be interesting. She felt devilish. She reached out for her chilled champagne glass and took a sip. She smacked her lips.
Damn, life was good.

Mart pulled open the front door.
For a brief moment his mind went back to that evening in late October when he had opened the same door to Naomi and Nick. The same evening of the dinner party hosted when Ingrid had masturbated him at the dining table. He recalled cringing with embarrassment at being seen dressed as a butler by two of his oldest friends.
But this time it was different. Naomi stood there, resplendent in a full length fur-trimmed coat, her strawberry blonde hair piled up in a chic bun, lips glossy and a wicked twinkle in her pale blue eyes.
Alongside - or rather one pace behind - her, Nick stood dressed in a similar butler&#8217;s outfit of rented tailcoat, waistcoat and pinstriped pants. His gaze was firmly directed at his well polished black shoes.
�Good evening.� Nao said, sweeping indoors. Nick followed her.
�Good evening, Ma&#8217;am.� Mart replied, inhaling an intoxicating waft of expensive perfume as she passed.
�Here is my butler. He will take instruction from you this evening. Won&#8217;t you ?�
Nick nodded, finally glancing up. �Sure.�
�Er � no, Nick ! We talked about this.� She admonished him.
Mart watched Nick&#8217;s eyes dart towards him then back at Nao.
�S � sorry. Yes, Mistress.�
She gave both of them a placated smile. �Better.�
At that moment, Kelly appeared on the staircase. Mart felt his heart thump and his throat tighten. His wife looked stunning. Still pink from her bath, she was wearing the figure hugging dress that she&#8217;d worn to Alain&#8217;s restaurant once. And the new �30,000 diamond earrings that she&#8217;d purchased for herself without even telling him beforehand sparkled under the wall lights. For a fleeting moment he felt that familiar pang of loss. Nine months ago he&#8217;d have walked up and kissed her on the lips, gotten an eyeful of her tits, maybe even have cupped her butt in his hand. But now he wasn&#8217;t allowed to touch or ogle her without being invited first.
She merely held out her empty champagne glass for him to take.
�Nao.� She purred, lingering on the &#8216;nay&#8217; and &#8216;o&#8217; as two distinct syllables. �Welcome dear. You look gorgeous.�
The two women gave each other a couple of &#8216;mwah, mwah&#8217; kisses on alternate cheeks.
Naomi held out her arms so that Nick could remove her coat.
�We&#8217;ll take two glasses of the Cristal in the drawing room.� Kelly said.

You could cut the atmosphere in the kitchen with a bread knife. Mart busied himself with the champagne. He looked longingly at the bottle of Roederer Cristal 1999 from a case of twelve he&#8217;d treated himself to a couple of years earlier. He poured out two glasses, feeling Nick&#8217;s eyes furtively watching his back.
�I&#8217;ll take these through, then I&#8217;ll be back.�
�Sure.� Nick mumbled in reply.
He carried the tray through the hall to the drawing room. Kelly and Naomi were sat opposite each other, talking excitedly. Mart saw with surprise that Naomi had lit a cigarette.
�Bring Nao an ashtray.�
He served them their glasses then scuttled around the cabinet for an old ashtray he knew they had somewhere.
�You know,� he heard Naomi telling Kelly, �I only ever gave up to please Nick. He really doesn&#8217;t like smoking. And I thought that as I was trying to get pregnant back then, it was the right thing to do.�
Mart found the heavy glass ashtray and placed it on the small table beside her. She glanced up but didn&#8217;t acknowledge him.
�But as that&#8217;s not going to happen, I thought, why not ? It&#8217;s not as if I smoke much. Only when I drink.�
�Which is quite often !� Kelly said, with a titter.
Naomi laughed out a plume of smoke. �Well, Kel, I took your advice literally. I know it won&#8217;t work if I just try to please Nick. I have to do what I want. Hence �� she held up the glowing cigarette.
Mart stood in the doorway.
Kelly waved him away with a dismissive gesture.
He left them to their drinks and conversation.
Now he had to face Nick.

�Well, who&#8217;d have thought, huh ?� he said, breaking the ice.
�Yeah.� Nick mumbled in reply, laying out the starter and cheese he&#8217;d bought as his contribution to the ladies&#8217; dinner. Mart was doing their main course and drinks.
There was a long silence.
�Look,� Mart said eventually, �don&#8217;t be embarrassed. Not with me. I mean, you and I are the last people who should judge each other badly.�
Nick shrugged. �I know. It&#8217;s just ��
�Takes some getting used to.�
�Yeah.�
Another silence. Both men busied themselves in the kitchen.
�Do y ��
�Do y ��
They smiled, each suddenly speaking at once. It eased the tension.
�You first.� Mart said.
�Do you � have any regrets ?� Nick&#8217;s quiet voice was almost a whisper.
Oscar Wilde wrote that most people die of a sort of creeping common sense. Everybody discovers when it&#8217;s too late that actually the only things one never regrets are one&#8217;s mistakes. Mart was certain old Oscar was right.
�None.�
�Honestly ?�
�None at all, Nick. Well, not really. For the first time in my entire life I&#8217;m true to myself. Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I&#8217;m glad I had a normal upbringing, a great career, and I have a lovely daughter. I wouldn&#8217;t change any of that. But this is how I want to live the rest of my life. I really want it. Sure I miss some of the things I used to enjoy like free-time and fine wine but �� He shrugged. �But no, I wouldn&#8217;t change this either.�
Nick watched him stirring the sauce on the hob.
�So � you don&#8217;t regret the � denial. Chastity ?�
�Nope.�
Mart gave Nick a puckish grin and patted his own apron just below the waist to indicate he was wearing his CB.
�Or Kelly, you know � other guys ?�
�Especially the other guys, Nick. Strange but true. Sure it&#8217;s hard, physically, mentally, emotionally, but no. Amazingly, no regrets.�
�I couldn&#8217;t handle that.�
Mart shrugged good-naturedly. �It takes all sorts, Nick. So, go on then. What are you into ?�
Nick inhaled and gave him a shy grin. �Bondage. All my damn life. When I was thirteen, fourteen, I used to glance at the usual grubby mags the other boys were jerking off over and they&#8217;d leave me pretty unmoved. But add a few ropes or chains and even the plainest girl could get me going.�
Mart gave a reassuring smile. �Who was tied up ? Her or you ?�
�Her. Strangely photos of guys in bondage never did it for me. Photos of guys full stop, in fact. But one day I came across a written story about women dominating men, keeping them in chastity, and that was it. Nirvana.�
Mart nodded, turning the heat down on the hob.
�You remember the Gor novels ?� Nick asked.
�Sure do.�
A shrill ringing of a bell interrupted them.
�You&#8217;d better go through this time.� Mart said to Nick. �Top up their glasses. See if they want anything else.�

Kelly and Naomi composed themselves as Nick walked in. They waited in silence, stifling their giggles, as he refilled their champagne flutes.
�Are you helping Mart in the kitchen ?� Naomi finally asked.
�Yes, Ma&#8217;am.�
�He&#8217;ll be fine on his own for a few minutes.� Kelly said. �Come here, Nick.�
She waited until he was standing just to one side of her. Raising her hand very slowly, she held his gaze, until her varnished fingernails were touching the zip of his pants. She smiled and pushed, feeling the hard resistance of a chastity device. Then, teasingly, she slid his zipper down.
�May I ?� she asked.
She made sure her question was clearly directed at Nao, not Nick.
�Be my guest.� Nao shrugged, cheeks flushed with excitement.
�Drop your trousers !� Kelly said, her teasing tone suddenly brusque.
Nick&#8217;s brown eyes squinted in confusion.
�Tch !� Kelly sighed, glancing disappointedly over at her friend.
�Do not � let me down.� Nao barked out the five words.
Shutting his eyes, Nick undid his buckle. Gradually he thumbed his pants down to his knees.
Kelly gave him an amused, encouraging nod. �Now those.�
She watched the tension in Nick&#8217;s jaw as he eased his briefs over the acrylic Exobelt tube and then down his legs.
�Open your eyes, Nick.�
She smiled and reached out to touch the hard plastic, flicking it.
�Suits him.�
Nao tittered, exhaling her tension. �You think ?�
�Oh yes. But the pubic hair has to go. It looks untidy. Incongruous.�
�That will itch.�
�So ? We shave our bikini line. Or wax. I like Mart hairless.�
Naomi fumbled her cigarette pack. �You heard, Nick. The jungle has to go.� She extracted a cigarette.
�Go light your wife&#8217;s ciggie.�
Nick began to pull up his pants.
�No.� Kelly said. �Shuffle over there. Small steps.�
She paused, watching. This was interesting. She felt like a Headmistress inducting a new teacher and pupil into her school. She really cared, really wanted them both to learn to enjoy it. Of course this lifestyle wasn&#8217;t for everybody. Not remotely. But there had to be so many people suited to this sort of relationship who would sadly never take the plunge. Fem domme or Male dom, it didn&#8217;t matter. Kelly wasn&#8217;t a feminist. She realised that it could just as easily be Master Mart and slave Kelly if the cards had fallen another way. But if two people like Nao and Nick were interested enough to experiment like this, then she felt duty bound to assist them.
Nick clicked the lighter.
�I think he should undress properly.�
�Yes.� Nao took a drag. �Take those and your shoes and socks off.�
They watched him strip to his tailcoat, waistcoat, shirt and tie.
Kelly chuckled. Her male friend of over twenty years standing looked ridiculous. Nicely ridiculous, but still absurd. �How long ?�
�Has it been on ?� Nao responded. �Four days.�
Kelly made a face. �Is that all ? Since he came ?�
�Yes.�
�And the time before that ?�
�Five days.�
�How did you let him shoot ?�
�Er � inside me. You know, s-e-x.�
�Any good ?�
Nao opened her palms, then flicked her cigarette over the ashtray. �Better.� She looked up at Nick, standing listening to her, then back over at Kelly. �You know, what used to piss me off was that we were only having sex about once every ten days, and it used to take him bloody ages to reach an orgasm. I&#8217;d be lying there, all interest gone, thinking about work or a crossword clue, while he humped on top of me. And I knew he&#8217;d been masturbating. That&#8217;s why he was so damn slow in cumming. Wasn&#8217;t it ?�
Nick lowered his head. �Yes, Mistress.�
�Mart was the same. Always checking his emails on the PC. Hah-hah ! Always checking the porn sites more like it.�
�Exactly. No more of that. Anyway, five days ago, he made me climax with his mouth first. Then he got inside me. And guess what ? He was done in two minutes ! I felt � you know � honoured. He&#8217;d saved himself for me and not wasted it on some 18 year Russian model and a piece of tissue.�
Kelly nodded approvingly. �I think it&#8217;s time we ate.�

An hour later, Naomi smiled as she sat back in her chair, twiddling the spoon in her cup, breathing in the aroma of rich, dark after-dinner coffee. This was fun.
Mart and Nick were now both naked from the waist down, standing like sentinels by the door, waiting to perform whatever task either she or Kelly ordered. If this was what it took to save her marriage, then why hadn&#8217;t they started years ago ? 
�I think it&#8217;s time for the entertainment. Do you agree ?� Kelly asked her.
Nick&#8217;s Exobelt and Mart&#8217;s Gerecke had been unlocked and removed earlier. Both their penises hung in a semi-erect state, in the no man&#8217;s land between excitement and embarrassment.
Naomi wondered how her husband would measure up. She&#8217;d only ever known one other penis and that was a forgotten teenage memory. Her gut told her he was slightly below average; nothing shameful, but certainly no prize winning marrow.
�When did you last cum darling ? Remind me.� Kelly said to Mart.
�29th December, Ma&#8217;am.�
Kelly glanced over at her, giving a wink. �So, last year ?�
�Yes, Ma&#8217;am.�
�And how many days is that ?�
�Forty, Ma&#8217;am.�
�Exactly forty days and forty nights. Just like Lent. And you, Nick. Just five, correct ?�
�Er � yes, Ma&#8217;am.�
�Well, this should be an interesting match up. Gentlemen, you may start your engines.�
Naomi studied the expression on her husband&#8217;s face, the dilated pupils of his eyes in the candlelight. Would he be able to stomach this ? She watched him hesitate, mind evidently in turmoil. If she had given the order, she thought that maybe he&#8217;d have refused. But somehow Kelly&#8217;s greater experience and authority were enough to keep him in line.
Slowly the two grown men, both in their forties, started to tweak their penises. Their necks and cheeks flushed red with shame and a sheen of sweat reflected off their foreheads. Thumbs and index fingers caressed the crowns of their dicks, rhythmically pumping them up to size. Mart was evidently more able to cope with the humiliation. He skilfully stroked himself rigid within half a minute. Nick trailed, blushing and flustered, struggling to maintain a firm erection. Naomi soon realised that, not only was Mart&#8217;s body in better shape, but his dick was slightly bigger than her husband&#8217;s in both directions.
She squirmed, strangely humiliated, sensing out of the corner of her eye Kelly&#8217;s competitive gaze directed on her.
�The rule is simple. Winner takes all. The first man to make himself cum gets to shoot all over the floor. The loser gets locked back up without cumming. All clear ?�
Mart nodded, a peculiar focus in his green eyes.
Nick mumbled, grinding his teeth. �Yes � Ma&#8217;am.�
�Then you may begin.�

Of late, Kelly had begun surfing porn sites on the internet. She&#8217;d never been into magazines or videos, but the ease and privacy of her recently purchased computer and broadband link made research into this new lifestyle compulsive.
And one thing she&#8217;d noticed was, in stories how men who&#8217;d not had an orgasm for weeks, they were frequently described as shooting &#8216;buckets&#8217; when they eventually came.
But her own limited experience suggested otherwise. Both Alain and James had seemed to produce copious amounts even when they performed twice or three times in a session with her. Yet Mart spurted less now than he had used to, as far as she could recall. It was as if, after eight months of scarce usage, his balls had simply decided on a manufacturing &#8216;go slow&#8217;.
When Mart came this time, he shot a single almost-white jet over the polished wood dining room floor. His knees buckled and his mouth hung open slack-jawed like a big dog.
�Let go !� Kelly barked at him.
His palm flew away from his shaft obediently and he screwed his eyes to focus on her, dedicating his submission to her. She gave him an imperceptible nod of approval. His dick was slightly thicker and clearly longer than Nick&#8217;s. The exercises and diet had got his body in better shape. And now he&#8217;d won the masturbation stakes. His reward ?
Hah, frustration ! In public. She could only imagine how hard it was for a man to stop half-way through. He let out a dissatisfied groan.
�Stop !� Alongside her, Naomi shrieked simultaneously at Nick who was still pumping away on his reluctant tool.
A rope of translucent drool was dripping at Mart&#8217;s feet. The tip of his dick was twitching, like a puppy seeking attention, to no avail. The single white jet and the small watery puddle were all he&#8217;d managed to expel.
Maybe if she&#8217;d let him continue stroking his shaft then more of the white stuff would have come out ? Maybe not. Perhaps she&#8217;d allow him to find out one day soon. In March, maybe ? Or April ? Who knows ?
Kelly turned her eyes to Nick, who had reluctantly withdrawn his fist.
�You snooze, you lose, Nicky boy.�
�I&#8217;m ashamed !� Nao muttered, stubbing her cigarette out.
Kelly glanced over in surprise. There was a hint of genuine reaction in her friend&#8217;s tone. She might just have been acting of course.
But on the other hand �

Later, after Nao and Nick had left, Kelly was lying face down on her double bed. She was talking into the telephone, although Mart was hunched on the bed too. He had his face buried between the globes of her upturned bottom, licking it reverently, while his right hand reached under to tease her engorged clitoris.
�Can you make it tomorrow ?� he heard her say.
He hated that she could speak as if he wasn&#8217;t there, and yet it thrilled him too. Pleasure-pain. He knew that it was part-act, but partly her genuine single-mindedness.
There was a pause while she listened.
�Goody. As early as you like. Breakfast ?�
Mart ran two fingers teasingly along her soaking labia.
�No need. I&#8217;ll send Mart round to pick you up.�
She reached behind with her left hand, pushing his head deeper into her anus. As usual she&#8217;d used the toilet before coming to bed.
�Sure. No problem. Yeah, he&#8217;s here now.�
Mart buried his tongue as if he was French kissing her.
�Silly ! I don&#8217;t think you should be jealous.� She wriggled on the end of his tongue, giggling. �He&#8217;s just laying our breakfast table, so to speak.� 
Mart dared to shift his head so that he could slide his pouting lips along her rim down into her gaping maw. She shifted her thighs upwards, to give him better access.
�Can&#8217;t wait. See you then. Gotta go now. Nighty night. Mwah !�
He heard the blip of the phone call ending.
�Now �� she groaned into the pillow, �finish me off, you ass licking wimp.�
He kissed and began strumming her clitoris urgently.
�Yessssssssssssssss �� she hissed, buttocks clamping round his nose.

Naomi patted the bed.
�Come here.�
Nick sat down, hunched over in just his unbuttoned shirt.
�A penny for your thoughts ?�
He turned and gave her a wistful half-smile.
�What you expected ?� she asked. �Better ? Worse ?�
�I don&#8217;t know. I need to sleep on it.�
She kissed his cheek. �Sure. You want to keep � this on ?�
He glanced down at the Exobelt firmly securing his penis.
�Sure. It&#8217;s what I deserve.�
�Darling, it was a game. That&#8217;s all.�
�No, Nao. That&#8217;s just it. I didn&#8217;t think I would be able to do it. You know, stand there and jerk off. Or try to. But somehow I managed. It has to be like Kelly and Mart. Not a game.�
She lifted his face by his ears, stared at him.
�Is that what you truly want ? Like them ?�
�Not like them. No cuckolding. No extreme stuff. But in terms of commitment. And chastity. Yeah, just like them.�
They both sat in silence a few moments.
�What about me ?�
�What do you mean ?�
�Am I expected to be you know � chaste too ?�
�N � no. I&#8217;ll look after you � in other ways.�
She pouted. �You haven&#8217;t done that in twenty two years, Nick.�
�I did the other night.�
�That ? You licked me to one orgasm, Nick. You call that looking after ?�
�Then would you teach me ? How to look after you � properly.�
�You mean that ?�
�I do.�
She laid her head back on the pillow and parted her knees.
�Then you can continue lesson number one � right now.�

A few evenings later, Kelly and Jack arrived home at just after eleven.
It had been her first visit to Alain&#8217;s restaurant since she had split up with him. He had joined them for a jovial glass of champagne before dinner. Everything had gone okay; he&#8217;d treated Jack with customary Gallic charm. The restaurant was packed with couples, it being Saint Valentine&#8217;s Day.
Mart was waiting outside for them all evening in the car, producing an umbrella to shield her and Jack from the drizzle as he ushered them both into the back of the car.
They drove home in silence, aside from a few giggles and some rustling, as she and Jack kissed and groped on the rear seat like high school kids.
�Phew, I need some coffee.� She said, once they were indoors.
Mart brewed up a pot while she put a CD on the system. The sound of the King&#8217;s lush crooning filled the room.
�Dance with me.� She said.
Jack took her in his arms, kissing the top of her forehead.
She gripped his muscled butt, smiling at the hardness of his groin against her tummy. She started humming along to the words of the Dusty Springfield classic, sung by Elvis Presley:

�When I said I needed you, you said you would always stay
It wasn&#8217;t me who changed but you, and now you&#8217;ve gone away
Don&#8217;t you see that now you&#8217;ve gone and I&#8217;m left here on my own
That I have to follow you and beg you to come home.�

Kelly winked at Mart, who&#8217;d entered the room, carrying a tray. Instead of humming, she broke into singing, dancing slow in Jack&#8217;s clench.

�You don&#8217;t have to say you love me, just be close at hand
You don&#8217;t have to stay forever, I will understand
Believe me, believe me, I can&#8217;t help but love you
But believe me, I&#8217;ll never tie you down.�

She licked Jack&#8217;s ear. I&#8217;ll never tie you down, huh ? Oh Mart, yes I will tie you down, and right now !

It was the first time that she&#8217;d ever had sex with Mart lying underneath her, staked out in bondage. His wrists and ankles were tied to table and chair legs on the living room floor. She was squatting astride his head, buzzing from wine and coffee, listening to another Elvis track, slowly undressing Jack. He was straddling Mart&#8217;s waist, facing her.
So much of what she had read on the net about cuckolding these past few weeks missed the point. She guessed it was mainly fantasies or commercial formulaic rubbish for pay-sites anyway. She didn&#8217;t consider herself an expert. Not yet anyway ! But she did know one thing for a fact. Real cuckolding cannot be about man-hating. If you despise your husband or &#8216;wimp&#8217;, then you wouldn&#8217;t hang around to cuck him. To cuckold somebody properly, you actually have to love him. And therein lay the problem.
She helped Jack ease his shirt off and kissed his broad chest. He smelt of soap and pheromones. His strong fingers skilfully unclipped her lace bra, urgently pulling the cups away from her breasts.
And cuckolding isn&#8217;t about infidelity either. Tracy had got that wrong. To object to cuckolding as a breaking of marriage vows misses the point. Of course it has to be done consensually and carefully, but you don&#8217;t have to stick with a contract if both parties want to change it. &#8216;Infidelity&#8217; is about one person having sex behind their partner&#8217;s back. But &#8216;cuckolding&#8217; is about a person having sex in her partner&#8217;s face. She smiled. Literally !
The problem is that cuckolding involves loving your partner and most married women aren&#8217;t suited to fucking other men for fun. She hadn&#8217;t thought she was either, until she felt sexually and emotionally ready to enjoy the advantages such a lifestyle offered. Fortunately Tracy was the only one of her friends to have allowed Kelly&#8217;s behaviour to end their friendship.
Mart&#8217;s breath tickled her butt, making her shiver. She had told him not to lick her but just to lie there motionless. Jack&#8217;s hands lifted her hips, slowly guiding his erection into her. She sighed contentedly. He was a good size but she was sopping wet and ready for him.
They rocked together. Her bottom swayed along the hard ridge of Mart&#8217;s nose and chin and she put her arms up behind Jack&#8217;s head for rhythm.
Love is Love and Sex is Sex. Each to her and his own. She guessed that swingers at orgies knew the thrill of blending sex-with-the-person-you-love and sex-with-somebody-else at the same time. But this was a different, heightened buzz. You didn&#8217;t have to be a selfish egotist to appreciate the advantages of cuckolding your man over sharing him with another woman at an orgy.
Jack was really shoving it to her now. She pushed back to meet him, the two of them building towards twin peaks. It had been so rare for her to climax from intercourse during two decades of marriage. Yet, now she was often multi-orgasmic. She could feel Mart&#8217;s features contorting, his breathing ragged, as she bounced up and down on his nostrils.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Her brain started to explode. Her nipples were hard as coat hooks and the fluid in her loins was molten as lava. But the brain is the most important sexual organ and hers was swirling with the naughty thoughts this moment always brought. Fuck you, Mart. You&#8217;re locked up. Tied up. And I&#8217;m fucking somebody else. I&#8217;m free. Flying, up � up � up �
�Aaaaammmmm � yesssssssssssssssss ��. Half-shriek, half-hiss.
�Cum � yes � cum � yes �� Jack was bellowing in her ear.
Vaguely she wondered if he was talking to her or himself.
And then she felt the hot slurry of his orgasm in her pussy, like trying to douse flames with cordite. She shook her head to clear the hair from her eyes and smiled into his perspiring, grimacing face.
Then, ever so slowly, she lifted her butt and peered down at Mart.

Mart&#8217;s face was numb. He gasped another pittance of air from Kelly&#8217;s anus and heard the muted sound of Jack chanting &#8216;cum �yes&#8217;.
He realised Kelly had peaked and now Jack was about to unload. His weight was heavy across Mart&#8217;s ribs making it harder to breathe. Both of them were using his body like a trampoline.
At last, he knew they were done, clinging together in a post-coital mingling of fluids, slowing of heartbeats.
Then, ever so slowly, Kelly&#8217;s butt lifted and she leaned to one side, peering down at him over her shoulder.
Mart blinked, drawing in a lungful of fresh air. Kelly was clean and scented but an ass is still an ass. Her grin was lopsided, taunting.
She was so good at it that he had to keep reminding himself she was acting. And even if she told him ninety nine times that she loved him, the lingering one per cent of doubt lurked in a corner of his mind. He knew Kelly referred to Jack as just a fuck-buddy and friend-with-benefits, but �
She shifted, altering her position so that she was kneeling over his forehead, looking at him between her legs.
�Mmm �� she said. �Yum. That was a lovely Valentine Day&#8217;s present. Say thank you to Jack for satisfying me.�
�Er � thank � you � J � er � Sir.� He croaked.
Kelly grinned. �I think he was doing rather more than sniffing me like a dog, wasn&#8217;t he ?�
He grimaced internally. Half his lifetime ago, he objected to men like Jack sniffing around his woman, eyeing her up. But now he allowed men to mount her whenever she wanted.
�Yes � Ma&#8217;am.�
She stared down meaningfully at her neat triangle of pubic hair.
His eyes followed hers. A snail of pearly fluid was oozing from her red and puffy labia. The smell of eau de toilette and sweaty sex swirled in the air along with Elvis Presley&#8217;s voice in the background.
He parted his lips a fraction in response to the spark in her eyes.
Her abdomen muscles tensed and she exhaled, squeezing her insides. The trickle of semen increased to a flow down one side of her thighs.
�Say please.�
�Pl � please, Ma&#8217;am.�
It was never hard to humiliate himself at moments like this. It was later, in the dark, when the heat had cooled, that he felt shame in the rational part of his brain.
She lowered her hips until her pubes lightly brushed his nose.
He stuck out his tongue, licking her upper lips first. He found it easier that way. Like he was only performing cunnilingus. If he touched the semen first it seemed almost like giving a blowjob to a man. Inevitably though, within moments, he moved lower and tasted the salty tang of ejaculate. Jack&#8217;s ejac � ! Funny how word-plays came to you at the strangest moments.
He slid his tongue over the &#8216;v&#8217; of her vagina to the small river running down her leg, lapping it up, until her skin was clean. Lick and swallow, lick and swallow, screw the eyes shut and block out the mind.
He felt Kelly moving above him, necking Jack. Worse, he could feel Jack&#8217;s dwindling and contented erection resting damply against his waist.
And meanwhile Mart&#8217;s own genitals throbbed. There was the familiar tightening inside his body, the triggers from his brain to his prostate all working fine. But his dick was unable to obey orders, secured as it was inside the best German steel, tight and unyielding.
Suddenly Kelly&#8217;s fingers were between her legs, in his face, splaying her labia wide apart. Her weight came down fully onto his head again.
He sucked in a breath and stuck out his tongue as far as it would go.

�This is all getting a bit samey.� Kelly said.
He nodded. Unsure of what to say. �Er � yes, Ma&#8217;am.�
It was the last week of February, a warmer, early Spring morning.
He held the funnel and glass bottle as she released a torrent of urine. It was dark and ammoniac, her first gruesome piss of the day.
She watched him cork the bottle and label it.
�I&#8217;m finding this routine dull.�
He kissed her labia dry of salty drops and pulled up her black thong.
�Don&#8217;t get me wrong,� she continued, walking to the basin, �I enjoy everything we do. But I think we can now take things up to another level.�
He watched her begin brushing her teeth.
He&#8217;d felt this coming a few days. It had started with her period, the day after Valentine&#8217;s. She had never been particularly moody but her time of the month always made her more introverted and silent. He&#8217;d spent long hours massaging and pampering her without any sex involved at all.
But something was up. There had been several secretive phone calls, whereas she usually spoke to anybody about anything in his earshot. She had gone out most of the previous day without saying where or what for. Mostly, though, it was intuition. Her mind was occupied.
She spat out toothpaste, gargled water and rinsed.
�Jack has agreed to take you on trial.�
Mart did a double take. Trial ?
She wiped her lips on a hand towel and smiled.
�Yes, Mart, trial. As in job. Probation period.�
Another job ? Fuck. Jack was some city trader type. Oil or commodities.
�Jack&#8217;s starting his own broking firm. Just him.� she sighed. �And you.�
He glanced at her, searching her eyes for a sign she was fooling. But he found none. Only a vaguely amused and resolute expression.
She turned around in just her thong and stood while he helped her into her black bra and fastened it, then her clothes, item by item.
Eventually, fully dressed she turned to face him.
�You will be Jack&#8217;s PA and receptionist.�

The next morning, he left home at 6.15 a.m., to drive to the station, and then an hour&#8217;s train commute to the office space Jack had rented.
It was a little before 8.00 when he arrived at the undistinguished, modern office block. Jack had taken a fully serviced suite on the second floor.
Mart knocked on the door with a JAG Trading Ltd sign.
�Hi.� Jack said, opening up, a phone cradled under his ear. He carried on his conversation while Mart looked around the room. There were two desks, two office chairs, a threadbare sofa, a large filing cabinet, table with coffee and tea equipment, and a window with a view over a scrap metal yard.
Jack finished his call.
�Hi.� He said again. �Welcome. Kelly explain everything ?�
�Er � maybe.�
He held out a key to Mart. �Eight till late. You open up and lock up. Tend the phones. Put calls through to me on my cell if I&#8217;m out. Some typing, set up and maintain all the files, handle my diary and emails. My old secretary has agreed to start in a month but � until then, mate, Kelly said you&#8217;d do it. Okay ?�
�Um � I guess.�
Jack winked. �The financial arrangement&#8217;s between me and her. Oh, and I take my coffee black, one sugar.� He pointed at the table.
Mart took the hint and flicked the kettle on. Jack&#8217;s phone rang and he answered. Mart brewed a coffee and added a spoonful of sugar as Jack&#8217;s call ended.
�Here � er, Sir.�
�I think it should be Jack here, okay ?�
�Kelly said I must insist on calling you Sir.�
Jack shook his head. �Phew, okay. She&#8217;s a dragon that missus of yours.�
And so the long day began. There were just the two of them. Phones rang constantly, and often Jack was on one call, while Mart had somebody waiting on the other line, sometimes two people. He was rarely asked who he was. It was just assumed he was a junior colleague or assistant. He set up a filing system and a Contacts database.
Jack went to lunch from 12.30 to 2.15, while Mart munched his way through a dry cheese sandwich he&#8217;d brought with him, washed down with a plastic bottle of Kelly&#8217;s piss.
At moments like this he sometimes asked himself, why ? He could easily flush her acrid fluid down the toilet pan and drink tap water instead. She would never know. She almost never even asked him. She just assumed. And that was part of the reason he never deceived her. But above all, it was because &#8216;he&#8217; would know. He knew deep down that he could end this all tomorrow, if he wanted to. But he didn&#8217;t want it to end, so he had to obey her, or do his utmost, even if he could have got away with something.
He belched, puckering his face as the bitterness savaged his taste buds.
It was after 7.00 p.m. when Jack closed his briefcase and dashed out, late for an evening appointment.
�Lock up, Mart. Gotta go. See you bright and early tomorrow.�
It was past nine when he unlocked the door at home.
The house felt empty, brooding, silent.
He turned on the light and saw the note on the hall table.
Five Words.
�Gone for a break. Behave !�


The house lay in the hills north of Faro, about 10 kilometres inland from the Portuguese Algarve coast. It was simple but beautiful; a whitewashed building, with a bougainvillea-clad deck and swimming pool, all set in a hectare of olive trees. Although it was only late February, already there was heat in the sunshine and sweet scent in the light breeze.
Kelly sat at a table on the deck with the plans laid out in front of her.
Her architect leaned in, pointing out his suggestion with a ruler.
Their shoulders touched, transmitting a surge of electricity through her.
This was different. This was dangerous.
She did her best to quell the excitement in her nipples, hard and visible in her bikini. She was dressed in just a swimming thong and bra, with a sarong wrapped round her waist.
She hadn&#8217;t fucked him. Ever. But this was the closest they&#8217;d ever been. All it would take was one moment, one � mistake �
He turned and gave her that easy, glorious womanising smile.
�What do you reckon ? Knock down this wall and make a huge master bedroom ?�
She gave a throaty murmur. �Sounds good.�
�Or � should that be Mistress bedroom ?� he teased.
She nudged him, feeling the voltage surge again.
He turned his head and looked at her, his Tom Cruise grin effortless.
�Maybe �� she croaked, �� we should go check the room out ?�

Jack&#8217;s cell phone trilled. Mart was typing a contract note for a trade.
�Hi !� Jack said, in a voice clearly designed to attract Mart&#8217;s attention.
�Where are you ?� he asked.
Mart guessed it was Kelly calling but he continued two-finger typing.
�Really ? Cool.� Jack replied. �Yeah, business is great. Yeah, he&#8217;s fine too.�
There was a ten second silence while Jack listened.
�Sure.� He proffered the phone to Mart. �She wants a word.�
Mart rose off the typing stool and accepted it.
�Hi.�
�Hi, darling.� Kelly said, sounding as if she was next door. �Are you behaving yourself ?�
Her voice was skittish, almost girlish, like she&#8217;d been drinking.
�Sure.�
�Good boy. I&#8217;ll be back in a few days. I&#8217;ve bought a house.�
Mart gasped. It wasn&#8217;t the fact she&#8217;d bought a house so much as the fact she&#8217;d never even mentioned anything to him.
�Bought ? You mean signed ?�
�Of course I mean signed. All completed. It&#8217;s ours.�
�Ours ?�
�Mine and Chantal&#8217;s. The lawyers suggested that she have a share. Something to do with tax law here.�
�Oh � where are you ? Where is it ?�
She gurgled, half-laugh, half-groan. �Mmm � a surprise, darling.�
�Wh ��
�Pass me back to Jack, Mart. And remember, behave !�

Kelly reached out and fumbled the old-fashioned phone onto its stand. She was astride him, his hardness buried to the hilt inside her. His fingers playfully stroked her nipples, his eyes shining up at her.
�And remember, behave.� He mimicked, admiringly.
She laid a finger on his mouth to hush him. His lips were soft but masculine. She had always wanted to kiss them. Ever since the time at Chantal&#8217;s fifth birthday party when Mart had interrupted.
�Don&#8217;t talk, Dyl.� She said. �Just fuck me, please.�
It lasted less than three minutes, maybe two. And yet it was the perfect fuck. Her Best Man. Over twenty years of pent up desire. The forbidden fruit of Mart&#8217;s best friend. He&#8217;d always wanted her and she&#8217;d always desired him. At last, she had caught him between his cute dates. And Alain, James, Jack, all faded into insignificance for her. He was The Stud. Dylan.
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven&#8217;s door.
She felt his pulsing flesh filling her up with his illicit bliss.
�Yesssss.� She pumped manically up and down until she climaxed ten seconds later, collapsing in a sheen of sweat onto his chest.

The pool was unheated and the water was murky and cold, but they dived in and swam, laughing and splashing like teenagers.
Afterwards, they shared the single large towel and lay in the sun to dry.
�Is this a one off ?� he asked, breaking the silence.
She paused, staring into the cloudless sky.
�Is it my decision ?�
He stroked her tummy in a way that made her feel good about herself.
�Yes. It is.�
Oh boy. A week ago, she&#8217;d been clear what she wanted. But then she&#8217;d stupidly thought of the only architect-cum-designer she knew and phoned him. Dylan.
�That wasn&#8217;t just a fuck, was it ?� she said. �A casual fling ?�
He looked at her. His teeth were like piano keys; white and perfect.
�No � it wasn&#8217;t.�
I&#8217;m sorry, Mart. I&#8217;ve screwed up again. And there&#8217;s nothing I can do.
�I&#8217;m married to your oldest mate, Dyl.�
He tilted his head at her, in a sad smile.
�But this is different, Kel.� He lifted himself onto his elbows and kissed her gently. �You won&#8217;t be running out on your husband. There are two ways this could go. It could be terrible for Mart, his wife running off with his best mate. Or it could be fantastic for him. His ultimate fantasy realised. Becoming slave to the two of us !�
She moaned into his lips as he ran his fingers up between her legs.
�Mmm � I&#8217;m not usually like this Dyl. You know me. Cold Kelly. Wasn&#8217;t that what your crowd called me behind my back ? I never needed sex until this all began. But now � please ��
But it wasn&#8217;t him she was apologising to.
It wasn&#8217;t even Mart.
It was herself. The woman she&#8217;d once been. She felt guilty and yet the urgent need was too strong. The best of both worlds. That&#8217;s what she could have. She never had to choose any more.
He smiled, gently easing her back onto the towel.
�Don&#8217;t worry. It will be a pleasure.�
Unngh. She gasped as he thrust into her. His lips joshed her cold nipple.
�I can&#8217;t wait.� He murmured.
�What for ?�
�To do this in front of Mart.�
Nmnmnm. Her eyeballs rolled in physical and mental turmoil. He started thrusting rhythmically, in, out, in, out.
�B � but � you �we � m � must � all � st � stay � fr � friends.�
She opened her eyes as he reared up on his outstretched arms.
�Of course, Kel. This is what friends are for !�
And she gave in to the moment, surrendered to the future.
Que sera, sera.



End of Part Eight
To be continued in Part Nine (March)









FIVE WORDS



Part Nine: March



It was Friday evening. Mart was squeezed into the packed commuter train and sighing with relief that his working week was finally over. He was strangely proud of the job he&#8217;d done setting up Jack&#8217;s filing and administration. It was dull, monotonous work but, as his dad used to say; if something&#8217;s worth doing, it&#8217;s worth doing well.
Jack had allowed him to leave an hour earlier than usual so it was only just past eight when he arrived home. The house was alive, music playing loud.
�Lay lady lay, lay across my big brass bed ��
Kelly was singing along to Bob Dylan, brushing her hair in the mirror.
She hadn&#8217;t heard him let himself in.
�Hi !� she called out turning, when she finally sensed him watching her.
She skipped over and kissed him on the cheek.
�I&#8217;m going to have to take those keys back.� She laughed, holding out her hand.
Mart dropped the bunch of house keys into her palm.
�Don&#8217;t look at me like that.� She said, suddenly cross. She was dressed in a new, clinging silk dress that looked designer-expensive. It was black with a red belt and a low-cut &#8216;v&#8217; neckline that accentuated her generous cleavage. She pressed the remote, lowering the music volume.
�I&#8217;m sorry.�
He was tired, hungry. She&#8217;d gone away without warning and now she was back. He just didn&#8217;t know what to expect next.
�Don&#8217;t stare at my tits, Mart. Fix me a glass of champagne.� She said. �And you may pour one for yourself too ?�
He nodded, gratefully. His first alcohol of 2007.
He returned with the glasses. She raised hers.
�To our new house.� She said.
He sipped. �Can I ask where it is now ?�
She licked her lips and put down her glass, ignoring his question.
�I&#8217;ll tell you over dinner. I&#8217;ve booked us a table for 8.30.�
He smiled, inhaling a breath of relief.
She reached out a hand and cupped his cheek.
�Tough week ?�
�Yeah. Long, hard and dull.�
She giggled coquettishly, reaching down to his zipper. �Sounds like your lovemaking, Mart. Pull these down. I&#8217;m going to unlock you for the evening. Give you a chance to seduce me. Who knows ? A treat ?�

They ate at a new restaurant. Okay food and service, nothing special. She paid with her card, smiling.
�Thanks for dinner, darling. We&#8217;ve just spent what Jack gave me for your week&#8217;s work. Easy come, easy go.�
He opened his palms to gesture it was nothing, a pleasure.
�May I go to the bathroom ?�
She tut-tutted. �No. I don&#8217;t trust you not to touch yourself.�
�I ��
�You can go in the car park outside.�
�Thank you, Ma&#8217;am.� He said in a hushed tone.
�Portugal.� She said, suddenly. �The Algarve.�
It took a moment but he realised she was finally telling him where the house was. He had loved the Algarve since they all used to take holidays there when Chantal was a kid.
�Wow. Good choice.�
�Let&#8217;s go.� She said, snapping her purse shut.

Kelly sat on the cream plastic toilet seat and punched the keys on her cell. While the number dialled, she shut her eyes and relaxed her bladder.
She heard the hiss of her piss mingled with the sound of Mart&#8217;s indignant gurgle. Amusingly though, his erection twitched in response.
The lips can lie but the hips always tell the truth.
�Hi.� A voice answered.
It was obvious that his caller-display had revealed she was calling.
�You get home fine ?� she asked him.
�Surprisingly little traffic for a Friday. You tell him ?�
�Not yet. There&#8217;s no rush.�
�What&#8217;re you doing ?�
�A shower.�
�You&#8217;re in the shower ?�
�Just finished.� It was true. Her flow slowed to a dribble. The pungent aroma of her asparagus starter made her titter.
�What are you laughing at ?�
�Nothing.� 
�Where is he ?�
�Oh, just cleaning up.� She watched Mart&#8217;s Adam&#8217;s apple bobbing beneath her, against the neck of the portable toilet.
There was a pause.
�So, what time tomorrow ?�
�Be here at one. No earlier.�
�Gotcha.�
�I&#8217;ll see you then. Bye.�
�Bye, Gorgeous. Until then.�
She flipped her cell closed and laid it on the tiled floor.
Mart&#8217;s dick was hard, parallel with his flat stomach. His groin was completely hairless, shaved and plucked, and his scrotum looked full and tender to the touch.
She picked up the plastic, 12-inch ruler and thwacked it across her left palm, measuring its payload.
�Can you hear me, darling ?�
She heard a muffled &#8216;mmyuthm&#8217; from between her thighs.
Without warning, she cracked the plastic whip along his veined shaft.
There was a louder &#8216;mmyaww&#8217; and his body jerked.
�Don&#8217;t move, darling. I&#8217;ve missed you. I&#8217;ve missed our games.�
She lashed again, watching his cock-helmet bounce twice.
His limbs tensed and she heard him trying to control his roar of pain.
�If you don&#8217;t enjoy this, Mart, just lose the erection, okay ?�
She have him eight more strokes, hard enough to hurt but not sufficiently savage to drive away his urgent desire.
Smiling, she used the tip of the ruler to lever up his shaft like a flagpole.
�More ?� she called down.
�No, plizz �� he could speak slightly more clearly now.
�More piss did you say ?�
She laid down the ruler and slid her hand up and down his scalding shaft a couple of times. It was red, throbbing, desperate.
�No more, please.� He gasped through the tiny triangular gap between her thighs.
Disinterestedly, she let his erection go.
In truth, she&#8217;d never had any intention of letting Mart seduce her, giving him a treat. For a start, her pussy was still a tiny bit sore. But it wasn&#8217;t that. A small part of her felt a little self-reproach for what had gone on with Dylan. But mostly she knew that she had to be tough over the next few days. Mart had already had a meal out, a night off, a few hours respite. It had been less than three weeks since his last orgasm in the competition with Nick. To let him cum again so soon would be a dangerous indulgence.

The next morning, he brought her breakfast in bed.
�Mmm ��. She yawned, stretching. �Sleep well ?�
He had spent the night in the guest room, his re-caged dick throbbing, but a reasonable sleep and the prospect of a weekend without going to work, had left him feeling refreshed.
�Yeah, thanks.�
She sipped her grapefruit juice and patted the bed.
�Sit.�
He obeyed. Her hair was tousled and she had no make up. She was approaching 40 but looked 30. She was lightly tanned, beautiful.
�You accept my right to set all limits, don&#8217;t you Mart ?�
�� Yes.� He croaked.
�The next few days are going to be a real test of that.�
He gulped. He&#8217;d known that she was going to say something like that.
�W � what do y � you mean ?�
She turned her head to look directly at him. �Last July, I promised I wouldn&#8217;t abandon you, Mart, and I won&#8217;t. Ever. But if you walk out, that&#8217;s up to you.�
He blinked, nervous now, his heart racing.
�I&#8217;ve found somebody I want to live with for a while. Here. The three of us. Him and me as � lovers. And you as our slave.�
�L � like James.�
�No, Mart. Not like James. That was just a short term game. He was never going to stay more than a few weeks, tops. Even if I pretended otherwise at the time. But � this time, it&#8217;s different.�
Mart stared at her. His mind confused. It was only two months since Christmas. He remembered saying that the only thing he was afraid of was how he&#8217;d feel if he lost her. And she&#8217;d replied in that case he&#8217;d nothing to fear.
Yet now he felt terribly nervous.
�Who ? ��
She put her finger to his lips.
�He doesn&#8217;t want you out of the way either, Mart. He doesn&#8217;t want your place. He wants you to stay. But he will be in charge.�
�Wh ��
�Sssh !� she said, picking up a slice of pineapple. �He&#8217;s coming to lunch.�

At that precise moment, only a few miles away, Naomi was in her car. Nick was performing a long list of household chores she&#8217;d left him while she was out &#8216;Saturday shopping&#8217;.
Or that&#8217;s what she&#8217;d said.
She parked her car and took a final nervous drag on her cigarette, before stubbing it out under her heel. Then she popped a mint in her mouth and rang the doorbell, checking her reflection in the front window. The door opened and a ruggedly handsome guy stood there, smiling easily.
�Good morning.� She said, apprehensively.
�Come in.� Jack replied.
She sat down in the kitchen while he brewed coffee and made small talk.
Finally he pushed a steaming mug down in front of her.
�You know about Kelly ?�
�With Dylan ?� He replied. �Sure. She called me.�
�You mind ?�
He pouted negatively. �No way. She made it clear from the start.�
�She � er � suggested I call you.�
He flashed a sheepish grin. �I&#8217;m glad you did.�
�I&#8217;m not Kelly.�
He blew on his coffee to cool it. Or more likely, to buy time.
�I know Nao. I&#8217;m not making any assumptions. Or judgements.�
She looked into his kind eyes and slowly relaxed. �Kelly thinks � well, you know what she thinks.�
�Kelly thinks with this nowadays.�
He pointed his finger downwards at his groin. Her groin.
She frowned and he picked up on it.
�I don&#8217;t mean that nastily. She&#8217;s a great lady. But what&#8217;s right for her, may not be right for you.�
�Or Nick.�
He nodded. �Or Nick. Or even me.�
There was a brief silence. �She said you&#8217;re a great � you know � stud.�
He laughed.
�Not just like that. But you&#8217;re fun, relaxed, reliable, discreet.�
�And Kelly thinks I&#8217;m just what you need. To try it out, right ?.�
His words. But her exact thoughts. Why was she here ? To try it out. Kelly was right. There was only one way to find out.
She dropped her eyes to her lap, brushing her jeans straight.
�Does Nick know you&#8217;re here ?�
�Yes.� She looked up at him, but diverted her gaze over his shoulder.
He smiled, peering back over his mug.
�Sure ?�
She shook her head. �� No.�
�If he doesn&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s not cuckolding, Nao. It&#8217;s infidelity.�
She stared at her fingernails. Yes, but Nick wanted her to dominate him. So why shouldn&#8217;t she do as she liked, just as Kelly did ? Why should her husband get to impose limits, rules ?
�He doesn&#8217;t have to know.�
Jack raised an eyebrow. �You want to have an affair ?�
�I don&#8217;t know what the heck I want. But I do know I want to have sex with another guy. It&#8217;s been so long. I know I want to have sex with you, Jack.�
He gave her a wicked but charming smirk.
�Now ?�
She couldn&#8217;t stop herself glancing at her watch.
�I&#8217;m �� Her voice trailed off.
Jack stood up and took her coffee cup out of her grip.
�Come and see my bedroom, Nao.�

Mart lay in the enclosed dark void under Kelly&#8217;s bed.
He had been there since 12.45 and it was now at least two o&#8217;clock.
He was gagged with a pair of her panties and sticking tape over his mouth, his ankles and wrists tied with cuffs, spreadeagled under the bed, just able to make out the springs and mattress bouncing in rhythm as she fucked her lunchtime guest. He could just make out her muted moans and the deeper groans of a male partner. He had no idea who the man was.
What he did know was that everything was changing again. Kelly had locked him under the bed with relish. There had been a look in her eyes that said � what ? That said the events of the past eight months hadn&#8217;t been enough. She really did want it all. The lot.
And what did he want ? At first it had been fantasyland. The realisation of a gradually rising need to live as her slave. It hadn&#8217;t all been fun. However he was glad he had tried everything. But since Christmas reality had set in. Could he really live like this ? Month after month, year after year ? Did he want it 24/7 like this ? Would she allow him to live any other way again ?
The bouncing springs reached a frantic crescendo and then stopped, muffled sounds of orgasms, as his wife finished yet another fuck with yet another man.
How many had there been ? Alain, James, the Italian in Rome, Jack. At least four, maybe more ? And yet ? Could he really, truly blame her ?
He lay there, his groin throbbing with unsatisfied lust, dick crushed in steel and balls firm with unspent seed.
Who the fuck was in bed with his wife ?

Kelly snapped the second wrist cuff closed.
She smiled inwardly at the old joke; what does a woman wear on her ears to please a man ? Her ankles.
Mart was coiled up, lying on his back, his hands locked to the headboard and his legs in the air, tied behind his head, his red face peering up at her between his knees.
It was three thirty. She and Dylan had enjoyed a bite of lunch after a maiden voyage round her bed. Then she had come upstairs to release Mart from under the mattress.
�Lie down.� She said, pointing at her white sheet. There was still a damp patch visible, semi-dried, down the centre of the bed.
Is he still here ? Mart&#8217;s expression asked her the question silently.
She shook her head, reading his gaze. �He left. Until another day.�
His green eyes blinked in relief. He lay down directly on the soggy mark.
�So I want to play just the two of us.� She told him.
After he was helpless, his ass presented, she teasingly ran a fingernail around the rim of his anus. His penis was unlocked again. She chuckled as it hardened, pointing down at his face.
She removed her robe, revealing her nakedness, and climbed onto the bed. She pushed her bare breasts against his upturned buttocks. Then, slowly, she revealed to him the massive black ribbed dildo that she&#8217;d hidden out of sight until then. His eyes stared wide from it to her, and he gasped.
�I can take it.� She murmured huskily, like a model from a chocolate bar advert. �So you can too.�
Moving to his side, so that he could at least glimpse her, she toyed the dildo between her pouting, still sodden labia. She let him watch as she fingered her nipples with her left hand and eased the dildo inside with her right.
�Nngghh �� she inhaled, �oohh that&#8217;s big � bigger than James.�
She pushed again. It genuinely hurt, albeit in a pleasurable, slightly masochistic way. It was 12 inches long and 3 inches in diameter at the fattest part of the shaft.
�You would have liked to fuck my butt, wouldn&#8217;t you Mart, admit it ?�
She let go of her own nipples and started massaging his prostate, teasing the hardness of his groin with her fingers.
�I � guess ��
�Ooohhh �� she winced, biting her lower lips. �Ouch.�
She&#8217;d got over half inside her, maybe 7 inches. To the thickest part.
�That&#8217;s me done.�
She slid it out again with a distinctive slurping plop.
�Look. It&#8217;s nice and lubed now. You should say thanks to the man who did this.�
She reached in between his knees and presented the black plastic.
�Say thanks. And kiss it.�
�Th � anks.� She studied him licking the glutinous dildo.
�Now, let&#8217;s have a go, shall we ?�
Thoroughly enjoying herself now, and intrigued, Kelly twiddled the crown of the dildo at the rim of Mart&#8217;s ass and began to drill.
�Hey !� She laughed.
Spread as he was, it went in surprisingly easily. His butt was wide open.
�You were made for this darling.�
But pretty soon he grimaced at her, breathing in staccato bursts.
She pushed hard, adding a glob of her spit to the mix to improve the lubrication. At about 5 inches depth, she met real resistance.
�Nah � No � Fuck �� Mart swore, shaking his head from side to side.
She stopped, leaving the dildo wedged inside him, and picked up the sodden panties and roll of sticky tape that she&#8217;d gagged him with earlier.
�Take it like a man, Mart.�
She quickly gagged him again and taped his mouth shut. He could still mewl and moan but only on low volume.
Slowly now, taking her time, she pushed it another 2 inches inside, marvelling at the way his sphincter kept trying to fight its losing battle. She teased him, tittering as each extra fraction of an inch produced more indignant &#8216;mwoah&#8217; noises. She stopped when it was as far in his butt as she&#8217;d managed to get it up her own pussy.
�Let&#8217;s take a break darling.� She said, leaning down to plonk a giggling kiss on his right buttock. �Never say I don&#8217;t kiss your ass too !�
She tore a piece of sticky tape off and used it to secure the dildo in position like a flag atop a mountain.
�Now, I think you&#8217;re ready to meet your new Master.�

The bedroom door opened.
Mart couldn&#8217;t see at first, over his own body. Then, like a monster rising from the deep, a grinning face appeared above his dangling balls.
Dylan !
Of all the guys in the world.
He roared behind his gag and shook his wrists and ankles in a futile attempt to get free. Ashamed salty tears spouted from his eyes onto his cheeks.
Dylan and Kelly seemed to study him like he was a fish in an aquarium. All he could see was their blurred faces peering and fingers pointing.
�Shhhh �� Kelly hissed eventually, kindly but firmly.
�I take it you&#8217;re not pleased to see me, mate.� Dylan smirked.
They sat down on the pillows, either side of his head. Kelly stroked his perspiring forehead. He stopped shaking and calmed slightly, lying still.
�Don&#8217;t make me choose, Mart.�
He looked up at Kelly, registering her words.
�She wants both of us.� Dylan added quickly. �Look, I know you&#8217;ve just had a shock. But we&#8217;ve both discussed this. You wanted the ultimate experience Mart. Well, now you can have it.�
He shook his head. Fuck them.
�Listen !� Dylan snapped. �You&#8217;re an emotional masochist. Sure, you like a bit of physical pain, a lot of sexual denial. But above all, Mart, you want to suffer mentally and emotionally. That&#8217;s right. Isn&#8217;t it ?�
Mart shut his eyes. Well, yes, that was true.
�And I can make your dreams come true. With Kelly&#8217;s help. And your cooperation. Your oldest mate. Your Best Man. Admit it, Mart, it&#8217;s like a fucking fantasy ! And you can live it ! Look at me.�
He opened his damp eyes, blinking, chewing on the gag. The awkward position he was in had started to hurt. It was hard to breathe.
�Nobody&#8217;s going to hurt you. I like you mate. Seriously. We can all gain from this triangle. Give it a few months. A trial period.�
Dylan shrugged and looked over at Kelly.
�Until July, Mart.� Kelly took up the baton. �I&#8217;ll make you an offer. On the 8th July 2007 you can choose. That will be our first anniversary of � all this. On that day, if you&#8217;ve had enough, we will go back to how we were. If you want more, we&#8217;ll discuss it. But in the meantime, you have to live this part � to the limit.�
He lay still sucking air in through his flared nostrils. His legs were cramping. His bottom felt stuffed and uncomfortable.
�That&#8217;s better.� She continued. �Be cool. Stay calm.�
He saw Dylan eyeing the black dildo interestedly. �That hurt ?�
Slowly Mart nodded his head to indicate that it did.
Dylan reached out and put his fingers on the protruding base of the dildo like a man poised over the launch button of a missile. Mart froze.
�I think we should give Mart a few minutes alone to think.�
He patted Mart&#8217;s upturned buttock like a farmer stroking his prize steer. Kelly nodded.
�Let&#8217;s go make a cup of tea.� She stood up and turned away. Then her head swivelled and she looked deep into his eyes. �You know you want it.�

He watched them disappear from his field of view and heard the bedroom door close.
He felt ridiculous and pained. At first, when Dylan had appeared, his erection had shrivelled faster than spaghetti in boiling water. But somehow he had hardened again. The shame had moved from awful to exciting. He cursed himself and heard his own muted roar reverberating off his gag into his eardrums. Everything they had said was true, and that&#8217;s what annoyed him more than anything.
Was he an emotional masochist ?
Did he want the ultimate experience ?
Was he prepared to live it to the limit ?
Did he want to live such an awful, fucking fantasy ?
She knew. They knew.
Mart knew.
He wanted it.


Nick was just finishing scrubbing their ensuite bathroom when Naomi arrived home brandishing a couple of expensive-looking shopping bags.
It was past four and she&#8217;d been gone all day but he didn&#8217;t complain. Her spending their money, while he toiled at home, was dead centre of his fantasies.
She smiled coyly at him, putting her bags down on the bed.
�Busy day ?�
He rubbed the base of his back. �Yeah.�
She sat down and lifted her knees. �Take off my shoes will you.�
He knelt and slid them off, rubbing her feet soothingly.
�Mmm �� she said in approval, lying back on the bed.
He carried on massaging her soles then slowly put his lips to her toes. She giggled, twiddling them. Taking her playfulness as a positive sign, he slid his lips up her calves, over her stockings, towards her skirt.
She swatted him away gently.
�No. I&#8217;ve walked miles. Go run me a bath.�
Reluctantly, he pulled away and walked through to set the taps running.
He suddenly thought of Mart. He felt a growing bond. In houses all over the country, normal guys were watching TV, or playing football, out with the kids, drinking at the pub, having an afternoon fuck with the missus, preparing to go out with a girlfriend, or to a club hunting for skirt.
And yet, in a few places, a small number of men like him and Mart were toiling over ironing boards or doing the washing up, while their wives and girlfriends relaxed. A smaller number still would be wearing chastity devices or lending their charge cards to women to melt the plastic.
He put two fingers in the filling bath to test its temperature.
And a tiny number like Mart even allowed their women to fuck other men.
He pulled his hand out of the water. It was too hot. Ouch !

�How do you tell a man is lying ?� Kelly giggled into her glass.
�His lips are moving.� Mart replied with a groan.
The three of them were sat at the kitchen table, with the remnants of supper round them; Kelly in the middle, Mart and Dylan sat either side of her.
�Women lie too.� Dylan retorted mock-indignantly. �And cheat !�
Kelly pouted. �I don&#8217;t cheat.� She paused, taking another swig of wine. �I just have sex with other men !�
She watched Dylan laugh and exchange glances with her husband in the candlelight. A few hours and some alcohol had calmed Mart down. He wanted it.
�What&#8217;s the most common male lie ?� Dylan asked.
�I&#8217;ll respect you in the morning.� Mart replied.
Dylan shook his head. �Nope.�
Kelly chuckled. She knew this one.
�I promise not to cum in your mouth !�
�Exactly.� Dylan said, patting her on her hand. On her wedding band.
They sat in silence for the moment. But she knew it wasn&#8217;t an awkward silence any longer. Just a gentle calm before the storm.
�Give me four good reasons for not being an egg.� She asked them.
Mart groaned again. �You only get hard once.�
Dylan grinned. �Sounds a bit like Mart&#8217;s life.�
�You only get laid once.� Mart continued. �You only get to cum in a box with eleven others.�
Dylan laughed, clearly not having heard the joke before.
�I&#8217;ve forgotten the fourth.� Mart said, staring into his empty glass.
�Only your mother gets to sit on your face !� Kelly announced.
Dylan chuckled loudly. �Now that&#8217;s not like Mart&#8217;s life. His wife gets to sit on his face often.�
Kelly punched Dylan in the ribs good-naturedly.
They all three sat for a longer silence, the mood tensing.
Dylan looked up at her, then at Mart, and exhaled. �Ready ?�
She glanced at Mart. They both nodded.
�Mart,� Dylan continued, �As I said earlier, Kelly and I have discussed this already. She wants me to take charge. There will be some changes round here. New rules and regulations. Is that clear ?�
Kelly reached for the red wine and filled her glass. She tipped the remainder in Dylan&#8217;s. She ignored Mart&#8217;s empty glass.
�I � guess s � so.� Mart stammered. �What rules ?�
Dylan patted his finger to his nose. �That&#8217;s for me to know and you to find out.�
Kelly slowly pulled the chain from around her neck and laid it on the table. The key to Mart&#8217;s chastity device glinted in the candlelight.
Dylan picked up the chain and twirled it in his fingers.
�First things first. I&#8217;ll look after this.�
She enjoyed the sigh of silent indignation that Mart breathed. She had always found it hard being his Keyholder. Well, not hard, but it was difficult to stay strong once a few weeks had gone by. Nine months ago she&#8217;d imagined that they would continue to have quite frequent sex. Meanwhile, the device would stop Mart masturbating so he&#8217;d be desperate for her. But the reality was that penetrative sex with Mart was � unnecessary. It wasn&#8217;t awful, it was simply something she&#8217;d grown out of. She loved him and, as an occasional bonding experience it was emotionally important, but that was all. It wasn&#8217;t even the other men. She doubted she&#8217;d have frequent penetrative sex with Mart much even if she were celibate. Other things were more fun. He had taught her she didn&#8217;t need his dick. So the removal of his Gerecke was only really something she did out of pity. And for health reasons. Once a month or so. But Dylan had no such qualms. He knew about something called milking without orgasms and was determined to be much stricter with Mart than she&#8217;d been.
�Secondly, I shall be moving in here. Kelly and I want to have a trial living together, not just being girlfriend and occasional stud. But we both want you here too Mart. Under our bed, or in the guest room, doing duties around the house, on call twenty four seven.�
�What about Jack ?�
�I spoke to him.� Kelly answered. �His secretary can begin Wednesday next week after all, so he can cope without you for just two days. You&#8217;re dismissed. He said thanks by the way.�
�You will wear female clothes while indoors.� Dylan continued. �I hear you have a nice pink tutu and bonnet, huh ?�
�Mart&#8217;s not into the tranny scene, are you ?�
Mart looked from her to Dylan and back.
�All the more reason to enforce the rule.� Dylan announced with a smirk. �There&#8217;ll be lots more but�, he looked at his watch, �it&#8217;s Mart&#8217;s bedtime.�

The next morning, Mart stood in a freezing cold shower and scrubbed his hair, body and freshly shaved genitals. The heating in the guest bathroom was turned off and his teeth chattered as he dried himself afterwards, under Kelly&#8217;s watchful supervision. His dick was shrivelled and blue with cold.
Kelly was still dressed in her white fluffy robe, but she had already brushed her hair and put on her make up. She pointed Mart to the door.
He followed her down the corridor to her and Dylan&#8217;s bedroom suite.
Mart stopped in surprise. Dylan had set up a camera on a tripod at the end of the double bed and he was hunched over it, looking into the viewer.
�Hi guys. Ready ?� he asked, chirpily. Mart couldn&#8217;t deny Dylan&#8217;s looks. Even growing up when they were both awkward and spotty, girls had flocked to Dylan. He was naked but for a pair of running shorts. His 6&#8217; 2� tall body was in great shape, with a six-pack stomach, broad shoulders and just the right amount of manly hair. There was a large bulge in his shorts.
�Cold was it ?� Dylan observed, looking down at Mart&#8217;s naked groin.
Kelly tittered. �Hurry.� She ushered Mart next to her. Dylan made a final adjustment to the camera then moved to the other side of her.
She hurriedly shucked off her robe and Dylan dragged down his shorts.
Mart suddenly realised that they were all three posing for a nude photo. Kelly was pretty in the middle, with one man either side.
One man who was tall, dark, handsome, fit, manly and well endowed.
The other who was less tall, less good looking, less manly and hairless.
With a tiny pin-prick.
�Smile !�
The camera flashed.

They took over 30 photos but that first one was the worst.
Dylan ran off several large, glossy copies on his colour printer and they stood in silver frames around the house; on the stand by Kelly&#8217;s side of the bed, in their ensuite bathroom, and even on the oval table in the living room. Unless they were &#8216;non approving visitors&#8217;, most people who came round in the months ahead saw the photo.
Saw why Kelly would choose one man over the other.
But she shared others in that first album with her close friends and, later, with an increasingly wide circle. Shots of Mart crouching at their feet while she and Dylan posed like big game hunters over their kill. Shots of him bent over while Dylan caned his butt until it was the colour of baboon cheeks. A shot of him kneeling face up with her ass on his nose.
There would be no easy going back.

Two days later, Kelly met Naomi in a coffee shop in town.
Mart was busy chauffeuring Dylan over to his house to pack up a load of stuff and bring it over, while Nick was out all day at work.
�So ?� Kelly asked, cupping her hands round her mug.
Nao rolled her eyes. �Straight to the nitty gritty, huh ?�
�Yep.�
�Look, you have to promise ��
�Cross my heart.�
Nao paused, looked down at her coffee, then raised her head. Her eyes spoke volumes.
�Fabulous.�
�Didn&#8217;t I tell you ? How many times ?�
�Twice. Once at his home on Saturday and once at his office yesterday. Thanks for clearing Mart out of there, by the way !�
�What did you do ?�
Nao giggled. �That&#8217;s a bit personal. All the usual stuff.�
�And you got off ?�
�Sure. I was a bit tense. But � hey, it was better than for ages.�
�Nick ?�
�Not a clue.�
�You gonna tell him ?�
�Hell no. He&#8217;d have a fit. Divorce me.�
Kelly pouted. She just wished Nao would bite the bullet. Cuckolding is so much better than infidelity. None of that skulking around and guilt.
�You going to carry on ?�
�Hard to stop when you&#8217;ve had a couple of French fries.�
�Tell Nick. He won&#8217;t divorce you. I swear.�
Nao made a face to indicate she didn&#8217;t agree. �How&#8217;s things with you ?�
�Incredible. This is the one, Nao.�
�What do you mean ?�
�This is the keeper.�
�What ?! You mean � like � long term.�
�Like till death do us part. Well, maybe.�
�You&#8217;re kidding. What about Mart ?�
�Mart ? He ain&#8217;t going anywhere. It&#8217;s a threesome, Nao. A &#8216;m�nage a trois&#8217;. Each of us gets everything we need.�
�Damn ! Mart&#8217;s sweetness and reliability and Dyl&#8217;s sexiness and alpha personality. Plus Mart&#8217;s money. I mean, your money !�
�Heck of a combo, yeah ?�
�Is Dylan great in bed ?�
�Now you&#8217;re getting a bit personal ?�
Nao simply drummed her fingers on the coffee shop table.
�Great.� Kelly replied. �But it&#8217;s not just the bed bit. He&#8217;s just so damn kinky. Funny how you can know somebody over twenty years and never have a clue what they&#8217;re like behind the curtains.�
�Do you remember about � maybe fifteen years ago ? There were rumours. He had some girlfriend who was supposed to be super-submissive. They said he liked bondage and domination and did all kinds of stuff with her.�
Kelly smiled. �No. Back then we weren&#8217;t seeing Dylan any more. Mart had a bust up with him. I&#8217;ll ask him about that. But, hey, he certainly likes his fun.�
�You lucky tart.� Nao said, finishing her coffee.
�You make your own luck. I mean it. Tell Nick.�

Mart drove.
Dylan was in the back of the car, bidding by phone for some expensive piece of art at Sothebys. Eventually Dylan bought it for thirty thousand pounds ! He never knew Dylan made that kind of money.
�Fuck !� Dylan exclaimed, snapping his phone closed. �Got it !�
In the mirror, Mart watched him open the phone again and hit a key.
�Hi. We got it !�
There was a pause. A trickle of sweat dampened his collar.
�I love you, K. Thanks a million. It will look perfect above the bed. I could never have bought it without you. Mwah !�
For the entire journey he never uttered a single word to Mart.

�Please, Sir. May I use the bathroom ?�
He remembered how embarrassed he used to feel the previous summer asking Kelly for permission. But asking a man was much worse.
Dylan flipped down the newspaper and peered at him.
�How many times have you been today ?�
�Once, Sir.�
It was after six in the evening. He&#8217;d used the toilet to pee after breakfast but not since. His bladder was full.
�I suppose so.� Dylan eventually replied grudgingly. �What ?�
�Just urine, Sir.�
�Well I suppose that&#8217;s some kind of blessing. Okay. Use the big red salad bowl.�
Kelly walked in just as he was finishing.
�There you are, Mart. Tell me, what&#8217;s a girl gotta do to get a vodka tonic round here ?�
�Sorry Mistress.�
Mart fluffed his ballet skirt back into position and carefully carried the sloshing bowl out to the kitchen. Moments later he returned with his wife&#8217;s vodka, ice, lime and tonic.
Then he returned to the kitchen and continued fixing their supper.


Kelly lay on the squidgy sofa with Dylan watching the TV.
Mart knelt between her knees, sensuously licking between her thighs. She knew it was his favourite comedy program on TV but he had his back to the screen. She was light-headed with lust and alcohol. She&#8217;d been tired the previous night and retired to bed at ten, leaving Dylan watching some soccer match on TV. He&#8217;d come up long after she was asleep and they&#8217;d overslept that morning. Nowadays, a 48 hours gap between climaxes left her gagging for sex.
She reached out and pulled Dylan&#8217;s face to her.
He smiled and kissed her full on the lips. They swapped tongues.
�Mmm �� he murmured. �I think you&#8217;re a bit horny.�
�A bit ?� she gasped. �Please ��
�You&#8217;re too far ahead. Let me catch up.� He looked down. �Mart !�
She felt Mart&#8217;s lips leave her skin. �Yes, Sir.�
�Remove my shoes.�
She watched and listened as, piece by piece, Mart was ordered to take off Dylan&#8217;s shoes, socks, jeans and, finally, his briefs. She leaned her head down and took Dylan&#8217;s erection between her lips. Mart&#8217;s eyes were locked on hers.
�Put my underpants over your head.�
She smiled as Mart stretched the elastic of Dylan&#8217;s white cotton Y-fronts and pulled them over his head. His green eyes peered out through one of the leg holes. There was a yellowish stain in the front of the briefs.
�Watch, Mart. How do you like your wife sucking my dick ?�
She saw her husband almost hyperventilating, staring at her slurping lips.
�I � I � don&#8217;t know ��
�Did you like it when she used to do it to you ?�
�I � yes � but it was a long time ��
She responded to Dylan&#8217;s words, doing her best to slide him deep into her mouth, then rolling her tongue along the underside vein so Mart could see.
�You&#8217;re not worthy Mart. Tell her you never want her to suck yours again.�
Kelly focused on Mart&#8217;s pupils. She wanted to hear and see the words.
�I �&#8217;m not worthy, Mistress. Please n � never suck my � dick again.�
She took her mouth off the end of Dylan&#8217;s throbbing shaft and gulped her saliva.
�I never intended to darling. But thanks anyway.� She winked at him mischievously.
Dylan rolled in towards her, lifting her head back up to face his.
�Put my dick inside your wife !� he ordered brusquely.
She watched as Mart&#8217;s hands slid between them, one fumbling her well prepared labia open, the other tentatively guiding Dylan&#8217;s thickness in.
Once Dylan was comfortable, thrusting into her on the sofa, she smiled at Mart again.
�Come behind the sofa now and kiss me on the forehead. Take off those things.� Mart obeyed, removing the Y-fronts from his head and leaning down to kiss her softly. It was Dylan&#8217;s turn to watch.
�Tell me how much you love seeing me enjoying myself like this.�
�It � is my greatest � thrill.� Mart croaked.
�You won&#8217;t deny me this, will you ? Ever again ?�
His eyes darted. �No, Mistress.�
If this were chocolate, she felt like a woman who knew she&#8217;d never get back into her old dress size again, and her husband was saying he was fine with her new weight. Heck, he&#8217;d even buy and offer her the candy cars.
�Stand up.� She gasped, as Dylan gave her an extra big bang.
Mart stood. She trailed a hand over the back of the sofa and fingered his chastity device. It was a twisted tube of stainless steel 3.5 inches long and less than 1.5 inches in diameter, with a padlock in the top.
His dick had expanded as much as the steel allowed.
�Ooh, that looks a bit uncomfortable.� She half-cooed, half-slurred.
�Y �es �� he gasped.
�Don&#8217;t go getting any ideas above your station.� Dylan grunted.
�No, Sir.�
�Bugger off and do the washing up now. Give us a bit of privacy.�
Kelly turned her full attention back to Dylan.

By late March, Spring was definitely in the air. The whole month had been dry, sunny and pretty warm. England looked at its best with lush green fields, bulbs bursting into flower and skies a clear, pollution-free blue.
But Portugal beckoned. Kelly and Dylan planned to fly down there, taking Mart, to spend most of April working on the new house. They had some visits planned by friends and even Chantal was coming over for 36 hours, which would require some &#8216;discretion&#8217;.
Most of all though, Dylan&#8217;s design for the house would allow Mart&#8217;s slavery to be taken to another level. The local crew of builders and labourers had raised a few eyebrows but they were happy enough to construct anything at the right price.
The day before the flight, Kelly drove into town to her bank and withdrew a chunk of cash, verified her balance, paid a couple of bills and checked her safety deposit box. She smiled at the papers Mart had signed giving her everything.
Legally dubious, probably unenforceable, and almost certainly unnecessary.
The coming month was going to be a hoot. An amusing hoax.
An extended bdsm game to end all games.
She just hoped she wasn&#8217;t being foolish.
Playing the fool was Mart&#8217;s role.
April Fool.


End of Part Nine
To be continued in Part Ten (April)









FIVE WORDS


Part Ten: April


�And what&#8217;s this room ?� Chantal asked, pointing with her finger.
She was a pretty, bubbly brunette, with her mother&#8217;s vivacious looks, her father&#8217;s intelligent green eyes, and a perfect pair of 34DDs all of her own. They were sat round the makeshift kitchen table in Portugal, looking over the plans for the house; Chantal, Kelly and Mart, along with Dylan, every-inch the professional architect and designer.
�It&#8217;s a cellar. For your father&#8217;s wine.�
�Under your bedroom ? Dad, you&#8217;re going to be uncorking bottles at night ?!�
Everybody laughed.
�You know your father.� Kelly replied with a chuckle.
Well, you think you do.
�Actually,� Dylan said, leaning in, �it&#8217;s because of the rock formation. I would have placed it here but for the weaker substructure.� He tapped an area of the floor with his foot. �Another advantage is that if you decide to rent out the property, your private suite can be closed off, along with the wine cellar. Best to prevent other men helping themselves to Mart&#8217;s First Growths !�
Kelly caught Dylan&#8217;s eyes vacuuming up Chantal&#8217;s cleavage as he talked.
Leopards never change their spots.
The conversation moved on.
�I love it.� Chantal said. �I&#8217;d love to come back here with Greg later in the year.�

They drove her to Faro Airport the next morning and she flew back to London, where she was staying with friends for a couple of days, before returning to Los Angeles.
�Bye Love.� They waved.
Kelly sat in the back of the hire car with Dylan while Mart drove home.
�You have a lovely daughter.� Dylan patted her knee.
I noticed, Kelly thought.
But she didn&#8217;t stay pissed with him for long. They had behaved themselves during Chantal&#8217;s visit. Soon they were necking while Mart drove them up into the hills.
Back at the house, the contractor and eight labourers were working flat out in the dusty, humid sunshine.
�Hoi.� Dylan said to the contractor, patting Mart on the back. �Tenho mais um trabalhador para voce.� Dylan spoke reasonable Portuguese, having worked on several projects in Lisbon. I have another worker for you.
The contractor scratched his bald head and frowned. �Mesmo ?� Really ?
�Sim. Ele vai ajudar.� Yes, this one will help you. �Mart.�
The contractor asked what kind of work Mart could do.
�Qualquer.� Anything. Dylan replied. He explained that Mart would do basic labouring and he didn&#8217;t expect to be paid. Just for exercise.
At this the contractor laughed and seemed much more enthusiastic.
�Vamos.� He said, passing Mart a shovel. Let&#8217;s get started.

Kelly watched from the bedroom balcony as the platinum April sun reached its zenith and began hammering down its rays on the toiling crew. Mart&#8217;s white body contrasted starkly with the nut coloured skin of the gnarled local workforce. She had thrown him down a tube of high factor cream and his skin glistened with it and sweat as he laboured.
She lay back down on the sunbed and adjusted her skimpy bikini. She picked up her book again and started to read. It amazed her that Amazon sold such things ! But she had to admit it was good, very good.
The drilling noise from inside the bedroom made it hard to concentrate. Dylan was personally supervising the formation and lining of the &#8216;wine cellar&#8217;. A big digger had carved out a huge hole and now breeze blocks, concrete and rubber linings were being used to create the space. He wanted it finished within a week !
She adjusted her bikini again, aware that her nipples were firm and her vagina was clammy. She slid a finger under the triangle of her thong.
Roll on the end of the working day.
Her book was called &#8216;Female Domination; an exploration of the male desire for loving female authority&#8217; by Elise Sutton. It made Kelly feel good to read about forty other couples like her and Mart. She smiled. As soon as she&#8217;d finished it, she&#8217;d lend it to Nao.
How was the naughty girl, she wondered.

As it happens, Naomi was sitting in a toilet cubicle at her offices. Her skirt and knickers were round her knees and she was texting with Jack on her cell.
&#8216;C U 4 lunch ?� appeared on her screen.
&#8216;Lunch ?!&#8217; she typed, smirking to herself.
They exchanged messages, setting up a rendezvous for 1.30 p.m. in a bar halfway between their two buildings.
It troubled her that she was having an affair. She knew that&#8217;s what it was. And yet, it didn&#8217;t concern her. After all, Nick was getting what he wanted. She was hard on him, domineering, strict. She let him set the agenda, even though they both pretended she was in control.
And in return ? Well, instead of her suffering the frustration that he enjoyed, or the boredom she&#8217;d felt for years, she was having her petals watered by another hose.
Was that really so bad ? Jack used a condom. She bathed. So Nick still got a healthy and clean pussy to slobber over when she felt like it.
It was cuckolding. Like Kelly.
Just without doing it in Nick&#8217;s face.

They met at a slick, modern bar that did a decent chicken salad and glass of wine. The place was emptying as other customers returned to work.
�Mmm, you look good enough to eat.� Jack said.
�You too.� She tapped her glass against his.
After eating and small talk, she looked at him wickedly.
�You ever do it in a public toilet ?�
Jack raised an eyebrow. He shook his head, grinning, pulling her by the hand.
They bolted the door and Nao fumbled with Jack&#8217;s zip.
�Fuck !� he muttered. �I didn&#8217;t think � no condoms.�
She sighed. Damn.
�You could do � something else ?� Jack whispered, licking his lips.
Yeah ? And what about me ? The little room stank. She didn&#8217;t fancy getting down on the tiled floor to blow him.
She shook her head, easing his zip down the whole way, kissing him.
�I&#8217;m on the pill.� She murmured into his ear. �We don&#8217;t need condoms.�


Mart hung from the sturdy beams of the porch.
His wrists were strung up and his ankles were separated by a spreader bar. Around him mosquitoes and night flies buzzed in the orange glow of the sunset. His skin was red with sunburn and streaked with dusty sweat.
Kelly and Dylan were sitting some distance away at a table. It was lit by a candle in a hurricane lamp. Two glasses, an ice bucket with a bottle of champagne, and a saucer of almonds, completed the idyllic scene.
He stared at them. He should have hated them. But he didn&#8217;t.
How do you explain that to yourself, let alone to somebody else ?
A buzzing insect pricked his helpless ankle and he kicked as effectively as he could.
This was slavery, pure and simple. Relentless toil in the sunshine, meagre rations, brutal bondage, mosquitoes at night. He hesitated to assume that no 18th Century plantation slave had suffered worse, but he was at least in the ballpark. And he was here by choice.
Dylan rose and walked over to tend the barbecue on which he was grilling sardines and then steaks. Enough for two. Mart had already eaten.

�What&#8217;s the plan for later ?� Kelly asked, cutting into her steak.
�I would have thought that was obvious !�
She rolled her eyes. �Apart from that !� She nodded. �Him.�
�Mart ?� Dylan tilted his head to one side. �Something new.�
She chewed, considering. �There&#8217;s � something.�
�Mm ?�
She paused. She&#8217;d never become so open and frank with somebody in such a short time. But there were limits after all.
�Mmm ?� He repeated, a little more persistently.
She couldn&#8217;t get the words out.
�Can I guess ?� he suggested.
She carved another bite of meat and nodded.
�Is it something to do with that little bottom of yours ?�
She winced. He knew her too well already.
�Am I that predictable ?�
He stroked her cheek kindly. �No. But ��
�But what ?�
�But great minds think alike.�
She raised her glass, tension eased.
�Tell me.� He whispered.
�I&#8217;ve never had the � courage � to go all the way.�
�Meaning ?�
�I&#8217;ve peed on him numerous times as you know. And he&#8217;s licked my bum. I&#8217;ve passed wind in his face. I&#8217;ve not always been that � fresh. I&#8217;ve even, well, you know, used the toilet while he&#8217;s been kneeling there giving me cunnilingus. But I&#8217;ve never � watched him actually take it in his � you know ��
�Mouth.�
She nodded. �And it pisses me off that Ingrid did that, and I haven&#8217;t.�
There. It was out. So to speak.
Dylan leaned over and kissed her on the lips. �Good on you.�
They munched in silence for a few moments.
�Why ?� he enquired. �Why do you want to do it ?�
As if she knew. She was ashamed, and yet � excited.
�Why do I like making him drink my urine ? Why do I climax easily when I cuckold him ? Why do I enjoy teasing and humiliating him ? I don&#8217;t bloody well know Dyl. I just do ! Sometimes I feel bad about it. I never used to want to do such things.�
�Is it anger ? Resentment ?�
�No !� she answered too quickly and too loudly. �Well, I don&#8217;t think so.�
�Would you like me to do it to him as well ?�
�Do you want to ?�
�You answer first.�
She paused to think. Hold on here, Kelly. This is Mart. Your husband.
�No. It would be a memory I couldn&#8217;t shift.�
Dylan smiled. �Good answer.�
�But would you want to ?� she asked.
He shrugged. �Sure. As far as I&#8217;m concerned Mart is fair game. He gets all that&#8217;s coming to him. This month is all about taking him to the edge.�
She stared at him, revelling in his handsome features as he talked.
That was it. It was about going too far. She wouldn&#8217;t normally behave like this.
Dylan wiped his mouth on his napkin. �We start tonight.�

Mart was helpless. Absolutely transfixed.
Eye bolts had been drilled into the bathroom floor. It was almost as if they had been fitted exactly to his measurements. His arms and legs were stretched to maximum in an &#8216;x&#8217; and he was lying on the cold, freshly tiled floor.
Dylan tugged the last knot to give it a final check, patted him on the chest and left the bathroom.
He lay there, deep breathing, wishing he could scratch his insect bites.
A few minutes later, Kelly walked in carrying a book. She ignored him, raised the toilet cover and sat down in her robe.
He heard the turn of the page and a whisper of passed gas. Next she emptied her bladder noisily in that drenching waterfall way she had. He&#8217;d watched her guzzling down plenty of wine with their dinner.
Then there came a noisier ripple of gas, a loud fizz, and a splash.
After a moment, he heard her nonchalantly turning her page.
A second and a third splash followed, along with a very unladylike trumpet of released air. The stench reached his nostrils and filled the room.
Eventually he sensed her placing her book down on the edge of the bath.
He waited for the sound of tearing tissue as she ripped off a piece.
But instead he merely heard the creak of the seat as she rose.
She stood above him, a crooked grin on her sun-kissed face. She was flushed shiny red with a little too much sun and alcohol. Her robe was open and she had her hands in an aggressive pose on her hips.
�We can do this the easy way or the hard way, darling. The easy way is just the two of us, nice and gentle, in private. The hard way involves Dylan, a crop and a lot of rough nastiness. Which is it to be ?�
She opened her legs and stood astride his waist facing him.
He wasn&#8217;t sure, but he thought he knew what she meant.
�The � easy way ��
She smirked. �Good boy.�
He watched as, very slowly, like a muscular prima ballerina, she elegantly spread her knees and stepped forward. Inch by inch, her buttocks came nearer and clearer. The remnants of her bowel movement were smeared like gravy on a dirty plate. Eventually she hovered an inch from his lips.
He wanted to gag.
�I&#8217;m not coming down, Mart. Instead I want you to lift your head up to me. Pay homage to your queen.�
Yes, this was all consensual. But he doubted he could stop her now, even had he been prepared to sacrifice everything to try.
He raised his neck and pushed out his tongue.

Dylan smiled, and pressed the remote.
The picture on the 50-inch widescreen he was watching in the bedroom zoomed a little closer. Mart&#8217;s upturned face and Kelly&#8217;s inner thighs were caught perfectly by the hidden camera.
Damn he loved this crazy kinky bitch !
He watched her rub her anus sensuously across Mart&#8217;s nose, leaving a smear like some Salvador Dali painting. She was literally making love to his face with her butt.
He switched to the second lens and the picture cut to her tits filling the screen. Not as good as her daughter&#8217;s, but still a fine pair. Her nipples were like swollen raspberries, ripe for picking. He panned upwards to film her face, mouth open in an ecstatic &#8216;o&#8217;. He&#8217;d enjoy teasing her about it when they watched the recording together.
Home movies.

Kelly found she had one last blast of gas in her barrel. She saved it up deliciously for a few moments, enjoying the rumble in her jungle.
Mart was gagging and choking but soldiering manfully on, his pursed lips pecking her rim like a polite nephew saying goodbye to his dreaded great aunt.
She pushed down so her sphincter enveloped his nostrils and let rip.
He groaned as tiny droplets spattered his face.
�Oh no, Kel, that&#8217;s too much !� he spat. �Please.� He dry-heaved, producing a fleck of stained vomit that dribbled onto his chin.
She straightened her legs and rose up to her full height, still astride him.
�Tough shit, Mart. Don&#8217;t you dare look up insolently at me like that !�
She strode over to the toilet and he heard her wiping her bottom clean on tissue. She washed herself with a hot flannel and soaped her hands thoroughly. Finally she brushed her teeth and then he saw her out of the corner of his eye removing her mascara and makeup.
Eventually, she stood over him with a plastic cup full of mouthwash.
She knelt down carefully beside his head.
There was a strange look in her eyes. They swirled like stirring a blend of dark ingredients into a creamy coffee cup; there was anger and irritation, and heat and lust, and a bit of embarrassment. And pity, gentleness, love.
�Here.�
He raised his mouth and she tipped the cup.
He spluttered but choked most of it down.
�Why ?� he whispered, his eyes quizzing her own.
She popped a tablet onto his tongue for him to swallow.
�Here, take this antibiotic. Don&#8217;t tell me you hadn&#8217;t thought about it too ?�
He gulped the tablet down and blinked in vague acknowledgement. �But fantasy is � one thing.�
She fetched the still warm flannel and began wiping his face softly.
�No, Mart. This isn&#8217;t fantasy. That ended last July. This is reality. It really is happening. And pretty soon you have to decide what you actually want. Because I&#8217;ve told you before. I can&#8217;t live out your fantasy.�
He slowly nodded, as if truth was dawning.
�It has to be mine.� she added. Five Words.
�But why that ? Please.�
She shrugged. �Because I can. Because I want to take you to your limits, Mart. And beyond. But mostly because I wanted to know what it feels like. It amused me.�
�Was it � a one off ?�
She smiled sadly at his clean face, throwing the dirty flannel into the basin.
�I doubt it, Mart. I can&#8217;t make promises.�
She stood up, walked over to the toilet and peered into it before flushing.
�I think �� she said, looking at him, �� today was just your starter.�

The next morning Mart was labouring hard, helping lay tiles round the pool and deck area. It was gruelling work in the hot sun, his body stiff, skin tender and feet blistered. Thankfully they&#8217;d lent him gloves for his hands.
Kelly had left a few minutes before, dressed skimpily to drive down to the local shops in the hire car. The labourers&#8217; eyes had devoured her butt.
Mart looked at her bum as she walked and felt nauseous.
Minutes later, Dylan appeared on the balcony, holding a mug of coffee. He waved down then gestured for Mart to join him upstairs.
When Mart arrived, Dylan was lying down on a sunbed parallel with Kelly&#8217;s. He was naked, his big dick lolling in a thick nest of pubic hair.
�Hey, Mart, morning. How&#8217;s the tiling going ?�
�Slow.�
Dylan smiled at him. �Sir.�
Mart gritted his teeth. �� Sir.�
�Here. Rub cream on me.� He held out an orange tube. Mart stared at it, frozen to the spot. �Here. Do it !�
Slowly, Mart took the tube and bent over the bed.
�No. Kneel on the floor. Get nice and comfortable.�
Mart obeyed and squirted cream onto his hand. He dabbed it onto Dylan&#8217;s chest and tentatively began rubbing it in.
Dylan smirked. �Don&#8217;t be embarrassed, Mart. Use some pressure.�
He started massaging it into Dylan&#8217;s skin and hairy chest. Dylan shut his eyes and sighed.
�She&#8217;s a good woman, your missus.�
Mart didn&#8217;t reply.
�Don&#8217;t get me wrong if I mainly focus on the sex. I also think she&#8217;s great in every area; interesting, witty, caring, and still very attractive. But sexually she&#8217;s the best I&#8217;ve had in a long while, Mart. Not because she&#8217;s a keen cock sucker or she loves anal. As you know, she doesn&#8217;t. But she&#8217;s so fucking horny and uninhibited. She has the juiciest, greediest cunt I&#8217;ve known.�
Mart squeezed another blob of cream and started doing Dylan&#8217;s legs.
�She cums so loudly and often. Makes a guy proud when he can do that to a chick, doesn&#8217;t it ?� Dylan opened one eye and squinted at him.
�Oh, I guess you wouldn&#8217;t know.�
There was a silence for about a minute, except for the occasional sounds of the workmen tiling below and the background hum of chirping crickets.
Mart had reached Dylan&#8217;s ankles. He&#8217;d done both his arms and legs.
�Do you w � want some on your face � Sir ?� he managed to ask.
�Do my groin first. Don&#8217;t want my dick burned. Kelly would hate that.�
He looked up at Mart, smiled casually and winked.
�Don&#8217;t be shy. It&#8217;s only a dick, mate. Flesh and blood.�
Jaw set hard, Mart put cream on his fingers and touched Dylan&#8217;s shaft. Dylan watched him, clearly amused, his dick starting to stir. There was a crusty residue at the base, evidently dried excess fluids from recent fucking.
�Mmm � that&#8217;s good. Rub it right in. Hey, if I ever manage to get Kel to take it up the butt, I&#8217;ll remember that you can do the lubing for us.�
The dick twitched, thickening. Mart jerked his fingers away.
�You want some on your face now ?� he enquired.
Dylan shook his head. �I&#8217;ll do my own face. You put loads more on my groin. Do my dick, balls, inner thighs, ass rim, the lot.� He shut his eyes and opened his legs, spreading his knees apart to give full access.
For several minutes, Mart covered every millimetre of Dylan&#8217;s clammy genitals. Eventually he finished. Dylan gleamed like a Roman wrestler.
�You remember Virginia ?�
Of course he remembered Virginia. His first proper girlfriend. Virgin by name, virgin by nature. He&#8217;d had such a crush on her.
�Yes, sure. Sir.�
Dylan smiled. �Married with two kids now. I bumped into her a few weeks ago.�
Mart nodded. He remembered the freckled teenage face, the pert boobs, spending long hours necking and trying to get his hands on her tits. He&#8217;d gone out with her for over six months but never got past second base. They had eventually split up and she&#8217;d got it together with an older boy.
Dylan was looking at him, watching him reminiscence.
�I fucked her, Mart.�
What ?
�Yep. All those years ago. I took her virginity Mart. She got so fed up waiting for you to push her. You never did. So she asked me to do it. Not in so many words of course. But she wanted it. We fucked several more times while she was still with you. We laughed about that when I saw her again.�
It was twenty five years ago but it stung as if it was yesterday.
Dylan smirked. �I&#8217;ve been cuckolding you for years mate.�

Mart stared unable to speak. His cheeks burnt.
�Go into the bedroom,� Dylan said, �and bring the black leather case from my bedside.�
He put the cream down in a daze and walked through the sliding doors. The room was plastered but still unpainted. There was a massive flat screen on the wall. The bed was a ruckus of crinkled sheets.
He picked up the black leather case and shook it.
Dylan twiddled his toes as Mart walked back out.
�I need a pedicure. Go fetch a bowl of hot water, soap and towels.�

When Kelly returned, she poked her sunglasses up onto her head and put the plastic shopping bags on the makeshift kitchen table.
Upstairs she found Dylan and Mart on the balcony. Dylan was lying on the sunbed and Mart was kneeling, filing his toenails. The leather manicure set was open on the ground along with a bowl of sudsy water.
�Hey, love. You get what you needed ?�
�I see you two have got better acquainted !�
�Oooh !� Dylan teased. �Bitch. Don&#8217;t be jealous. You can have one after me. Mart&#8217;s doing a lovely job !�
Kelly leaned down and kissed Dylan on his glistening forehead.
�Hot ?�
�Boiling.�
She peered over the railings at the men tiling. Then she pulled back and removed her cotton top over her head. She was wearing just a swimming set underneath and tiny shorts. She undid the strings of her bikini, allowing her boobs to tumble out.
�Nice.� Dylan said, reaching out to handle them.
Mart glanced up from Dylan&#8217;s feet.
�No looking.� Kelly admonished him. �Unless you&#8217;re invited.�
She pulled off her shorts, standing in just her black swimming thong. It was a Brazilian costume. A &#8216;fil dental&#8217;. Dental floss ! The whole thing was barely more than shoelaces linking a tiny triangular patch.
Dylan patted the sun bed next to him.
�Lie down. Shall I cream you ? Or do you want Mart to do it ?�
She smiled, settling down on the bed, lowering her sunglasses.
�You, please. I don&#8217;t want him touching my breasts any more.�

What is erotic ?
Mart knelt, listening to Kelly and Mart talking as if he wasn&#8217;t there. He filed Dylan&#8217;s toenails and buffed each one in turn.
Sometimes it&#8217;s easy to say, like when you are watching a woman slurp on your spurting dick, or you are hunched between her thighs licking her excited, fragrant nubbin until her hands scratch the headboard in orgasm.
Those sorts of moments are sensually erotic and the physical response in your genitals would tell you that, even if your brain didn&#8217;t.
For a submissive, other things that wouldn&#8217;t be exciting for the average vanilla are self-evidently erotic like the tug of velvet bonds or the slap of a hand on your butt. No dispute there.
But then there are the meats and poisons. The sub male who finds it erotic to be dressed as a baby and given a bottle of warm milk. Another sub male cannot see anything exciting about being &#8216;adult babied&#8217;. In fact, the idea is a turn-off, but instead he adores the look and feel of a woman&#8217;s stiletto heels. One sub&#8217;s meat is another sub&#8217;s poison. Mart found it exquisite agony to be cuckolded by Kelly and yet Nick would poison Naomi if she tried to do that to him.
Each to his, or her, own.
He waited patiently, head down, while Dylan sat on his sunbed and rubbed sun cream all over Kelly&#8217;s body. Eventually Dylan lay back down and pushed his unfinished, cheesy right foot back under Mart&#8217;s nose.
Take last night. Rationally, it wasn&#8217;t erotic. At the time, it hadn&#8217;t been remotely exciting. It was disgusting. He had despised Kelly for doing it. Had despised himself too.
And yet.
Now, the morning after the night before, what did he think ? The disgusting stink and taste, the nauseous reaction and instinctive urge to vomit were all gone. What remained ? A strange, overpowering buzz. It wasn&#8217;t the act itself. It was the totality of her domination and his submission. The subspace he had entered was complete. He was a &#8216;no limits&#8217; slave.
And so here he was giving a pedicure to her boyfriend. Not just her boyfriend, as the others had been. His Master. There was no denying it. Was it erotic kneeling at this man&#8217;s feet ? Not really. It felt like last night had. He despised himself. He felt no response in his groin doing this. He was flaccid inside his Gerecke. But he was right at the limit of subspace, not knowing whether he would like to live like this for the remainder of his life, or whether he would have to walk away.

Kelly laid out a healthy meal of sardines, cheeses and fresh salads.
She found some leftovers in the fridge too. For Mart. She dumped them in a bowl and poured him a pint glass of chilled golden nectar. Gotta keep up your fluids !
The Portuguese crew were huddled under the shade of olive trees taking a lunchtime siesta. But the house was progressing well. Aside from knocking down a few walls and building the cellar, most of the work was only modernising and refurbishment; tiling, lighting, plumbing, plastering, painting. Dylan&#8217;s design kept the essence of the original artisan structure but blended it with high tech facilities and 21st Century comfort.
She reached for a bottle of chilled rose wine but decided against it.
No Kel&#8217; dear, you&#8217;re drinking just a wee bit too much.
The problem about her new life with so much freedom, money and time on her hands was self-discipline. On the one hand she enjoyed the contrast with Mart&#8217;s forced labour, frequent exercise and strict, non-alcoholic regime, but on the other she&#8217;d always been proud of her own work ethic and self control. Her mom had brought her up to follow a simple folksy saying; just coz you could, doesn&#8217;t mean you should.

The long, cloudless days started to merge into each other. For Dylan and Kelly they were largely a holiday, punctuated by paperback novels, swims in the cleaned and warmed pool, and plenty of sun, snoozing and sex.
For Mart, the days comprised a basic diet of household chores and labouring alongside the Portuguese, interspersed with petty humiliations. But the evenings each featured a different idea designed to take him yet further down the path to abject servitude.
Dylan, in particular, loved to watch Mart masturbate himself to the brink without reaching orgasm. He would be their &#8216;entertainment&#8217; over cocktails or dinner, while they drank and ate as the sun went down. Like most celibates, Mart found that so long as he didn&#8217;t get excited, the build up of testosterone and need in his loins produced a kind of tantric, positive energy.
But being unlocked and forced to stroke and pump his dick for their amusement, sending production signals to his testicles, and stirring the memories of just how good that longed-for-orgasm would feel, left him feeling negative and resentful afterwards. And hugely frustrated.
After the jacking off ordeal, Dylan had Mart doing nude exercises �to take his mind off his balls�. He would have to do jogging on the spot, press ups, stomach crunches and, worst of all, &#8216;star jumps&#8217;. Mart had to do endless repetitions of the humiliating jumps stretching his arms and legs wide, then to his sides again, while his dick and scrotum flapped around uselessly.
But at the end of their first week, Dylan came up with a new one, combining masturbation with exercise. He stretched three linked elastic bands tight across an open doorway at waist height. Then Mart was ordered to put his erection through the middle one and to start &#8216;fucking&#8217; the elastic. The thin piece of rubber provided a small amount of friction as Mart stood in the doorway, thrusting his body backwards and forwards manically, teasing his shaft. It was enough to keep him hard and exasperated, but not sufficient for him to reach an orgasm.
�Come on Marty. Just one more minute. If you can make yourself cum in that time, then you&#8217;re allowed to spurt onto the floor.�
Yet another &#8216;game&#8217; Dylan enjoyed was producing his set of poker dice and allowing Mart the chance to &#8216;throw an orgasm&#8217;. To do so, Mart had to throw five dice, one at a time, and they all had to come up aces. The odds of course, were tiny, but the theoretical possibility made it amusing, especially if Mart threw an ace with his first dice.
�Two chances, Mart.� Dylan joked. �Slim and none. But go for it.�
Each night, spreadeagled on a mattress in what was called Chantal&#8217;s bedroom, Mart lay awake. Yes, his insect bites itched, his limbs ached, his stomach growled and his dick was uncomfortable.
But it was his pride that hurt most.
This was all his own fault.
He knew he was near to breaking point.
It was strange. At times, he actually wanted everything that was being dished out to him. Maybe even more, worse, harder. But the moments of doubt were more frequent now, greater misgivings. There had been a beginning to all this - that sultry night back in July last year. There had been a middle - at Christmas, over New Year.
But what was to be the End ?
He lay there and thought about his career, his company. There had been a time in the mid-nineties when a competitor had targeted Mart and Kelly&#8217;s business and tried to undercut them. At first, he had accepted it, hoping that clients would remain loyal to his level of quality. But once the third major account had been lost, Mart had fought back.
He smiled in the dark. He knew he was at heart a mild mannered man, a decent guy. But still waters run deep. He planned. He didn&#8217;t pay himself anything for 18 months. He had slashed unnecessary costs and undercut the competition, ruthlessly winning back accounts and then taking theirs, until their bankers closed them down on Christmas Eve 1997.
Merry Christmas fuckers !
So he had to make a plan now. His favourite film of all time was The Shawshank Redemption, the story of a character called Andy Dufresne who plans and achieves his own redemption against the odds. Mart had to do the same and he had to show the same patience and fortitude. He was fearful of admitting to himself, and to Kelly, that he wanted his old life back. He had to hope that she felt the same way.
Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free.
In the meantime, like Andy, he&#8217;d just have to grin and bear it.

Naomi grinned and clicked the &#8216;Purchase Your Flight&#8217; button.
Nick was clanking about in the kitchen doing the washing up. Her lips tightened in a frown of disapproval. It was 9.40 p.m. Pretty soon she&#8217;d have to put on her &#8216;Mistress de Sade face&#8217; and give him a verbal and corporal thrashing of some sort or the other.
Truth was, she&#8217;d rather be curling up in bed with a camomile tea to watch the News at Ten. This whole domination thing was so � wearing. Yes, there were the illicit perks. She was acutely aware of the well used throbbing in her pussy, and maybe that was part of the reason she just wanted to watch TV now. But she wanted Nick to just accept his lot, not bloody well come seeking attention all the time.
Ten minutes later, he was bent before her clutching his ankles as she gave him a dozen crisp strokes of the cane across his bare ass. She ignored his pitiful mewls and hit him harder than she ought to have.
He kissed her feet, dick confined in his Exobelt.
�Fetch the key.�
He scurried back and she unlocked him. It had been nine days.
She sat in a chair and watched him, as he frantically knelt the other side of a glass coffee table and jerked himself off to the point of orgasm.
�M � may I c � cum, M � Mistress.� He mumbled, salivating.
She glanced at her watch. �Hurry.�
He spurted a line like liquid cocaine over the glass tabletop.
She gave him a slight, thin smile. �Now lap that up.�
She studied him as he licked away then got up and left the room.
If she was quick, she could still catch the start of the News from her bed.


On Easter Sunday, 8th April, they took off to the beach for the day. The short drive to the coast took 30 minutes in the slow holiday traffic.
Mart carried their picnic and towels across the crowded beach. Dylan and Kelly lay next to each other sporting bronzed tans and smart swimwear while Mart crouched, still pale in places, burnt red in others, blotchy with bites, wearing baggy canvas shorts. At least he had been allowed to remove his CB earlier that morning.
Kelly patted the edge of her towel with a relaxed smile.
�Here, Mart, Rub some cream on my back will you.�
He eagerly complied, enjoying the feel of his fingers on her skin. It had been days since he had touched her. She peeked up at him.
�Mmm � nice.�
�Hey,� Dylan objected mock-seriously �don&#8217;t get too familiar, huh ?�
She slapped at him playfully.
�Come on, Dyl. Don&#8217;t take this all too seriously.�
Mart carried on in silence, running his hands as sensuously and soothingly as he could, tracing his fingertips as near her inner thighs as he dared.
He wondered what was going on in his wife&#8217;s mind. She seemed to have gone through a period of embarrassment after the evening in her bathroom. She&#8217;d left him to Dylan&#8217;s whims. Yet now, he sensed she wanted to build bridges again.
Dylan was silent a while, perusing the crowded beach.
�Hey, Mart.�
�Yes � Sir.�
�What do you fancy ? Guys or girls ?�
�Girls, Sir.�
�See those two gay guys preening together.�
�Yes.�
�And that group of four chicks.�
Mart spotted a quartet of brunettes, of varying degrees of attractiveness. One was pretty, two okay, the fourth very plain. Not of them looked to be more than late teens, early twenties.
�Yes.�
�Prefer the girls, right ?�
He nodded.
Dylan threw him a towel, paperback and a coil of white lycra.
�Go set up your towel as near to those chicks as you can. Open the book and obey the instructions inside.� He exchanged grins with Kelly. �Enjoy, Mart.�
The local girls pretty much ignored him as he laid down his towel. He caught one out the corner of his eye looking a little teed off that he was no more than five feet from her. To his other side there was an older husband and wife type couple and there were several other people nearby. Most of the sand was covered by sunbathers all the way down to the shoreline.
He sat down on the towel and opened the paperback.
&#8216;Hi Mart. Turn to page 11&#8217; was written in black biro.
He turned the pages.
&#8216;Time to change. Stand up on your towel and remove your shorts. Then put on your new white racers. Take your time. Put on a show !&#8217;
Mart froze. Carefully he examined the coil of thin white lycra. It was the most meagre male swimming costume he&#8217;d ever seen.
He looked about him in a daze. Nobody was paying him any attention, other than he could sense Dylan and Kelly watching from further up the beach. The girls alongside him were engrossed in animated conversation.
With a sigh of resignation, he slowly stood up on his towel. Being a good Catholic country, nudity is not allowed in Portugal but people turn a blind eye to a quick change of costume.
He looked around, seeking a moment when there were no eyes looking in his direction. The instruction said take his time, put on a show, but he thought he could debate what was slow enough afterwards. Shutting his eyes in a silent plea, he undid the top button of his shorts, ripped down the zip, and pulled them down.
His heart was hammering. He rushed and tripped, staggering onto the sand. Suddenly he saw that the nearest girl to him was staring, mouth open. He kicked off the shorts and sought the leg holes of the white lycra trunks.
He blushed, realising what he looked like. An adult in his forties, pale and insect bitten, with a completely shaved pubic area. Now all four girls were looking at him, along with several other people. Somehow he managed to shrug, a gesture combining apology and nonchalance. The damn trunks had snagged in his toes, slowing him down.
One of them twisted her head to look away, but the other three started to laugh. It was like a slow motion scene from a horror movie; first their lips twisted, gradually they formed smiles, teeth flashed white, and then the snort of suppressed mirth. Finally, they broke into giggles.
He pulled the trunks up and somehow noticed in his haze the &#8216;s&#8217; on the label. They had bought him small size ! He tugged as hard as he could and managed to get the stretchy material over his skin and up to his waist.
They were really only a white thong. What he&#8217;d heard referred to as a &#8216;banana hammock&#8217;. The waistband didn&#8217;t reach up to his waist and the leg holes were cut obscenely high on his thighs.
He stood there, beetroot red and deep breathing, as gradually the twenty or so pairs of eyes that had been watching him averted their gaze.
Feeling his eyes watering, Mart sat heavily back down on the towel.

Nick presented the big box to Naomi. It was wrapped in shiny red paper.
She shrugged. �You shouldn&#8217;t have. I didn&#8217;t get you anything.�
He opened his palms. �You didn&#8217;t need to.�
Inside was a large chocolate Easter Egg with a card.
On the front, there was a cartoon of a man dressed in a maid&#8217;s uniform doing the vacuuming, while a woman lounged on the sofa eating chocolates.
She smiled at him. �Thanks Nick.�
He nodded. �The card seemed appropriate.�
�Where&#8217;s her lover ?�
He frowned a moment, until she gave him a crooked grin, unwrapping the paper from an end of the egg.
�Only joking darling.�
He exhaled. Kelly was a bad influence on his wife.
�It really is a hard limit for you, isn&#8217;t it ?� she said, slightly wistfully.
He nodded again. �I&#8217;m sorry.� He wasn&#8217;t sure why he was sorry, but he figured an apology wouldn&#8217;t hurt.
She broke off some chocolate and popped a piece in her mouth.
�No worries, Nick. I much prefer chocolate to sex anyway !�

Mart lay on the towel in his ridiculous trunks.
He reopened the book.
&#8216;Well done !&#8217; was written on page 13. They&#8217;d known he&#8217;d do it.
&#8216;Now think naughty thoughts and stroke your bulge until you get an erection. Then make a pass at one of your neighbours.&#8217;
He swallowed. This was going too far. But he steeled himself anyway.
He glanced out of the corner of his eye at the prettiest of the four girls. She was slightly horsy-looking but with lovely brown eyes and a lush mane of brunette hair. Her coltish body was slim yet curved in the right places.
He imagined her sitting on his face and sucking his dick in a classic 69. Surreptitiously, he ran his finger along the ridge of his lycra trunks.
He felt his body responding. His shaft slowly thickened. He squeezed his eyes tight and then opened them.
The girl was looking at him, a horrified scowl on her face.
He winked.
There was a flurry of Portuguese he didn&#8217;t understand. She was talking to her friends. They started seizing up their stuff, ready to relocate.
Suddenly Dylan was there, like Superman copping the bad guy. He spoke a mix of Portuguese and English to the girls, calming them down.
Mart got a load of sand kicked in his face as Dylan pushed him away.
�I&#8217;m sorry.� He said. �Please. Por favor. Sit back down. My friend is �� Dylan made the international sign of twirling his index finger at his head.
Mart lay there, too embarrassed and horrified to defend himself.
�Come.� Dylan said, pulling him up. �Leave these poor young ladies alone. Bring your book and towel.�
Mart watched them slowly sitting back down, as he skulked away.

Nick was downstairs when he heard the phone ringing.
The familiar tone of Naomi&#8217;s cell came from the hall. She&#8217;d left her handbag on the table while she took a quick shower. He ignored it.
But a minute later it rang again. He called upstairs.
�Nao !�
The noise of the shower pump and water jets was just audible.
He ferreted in her bag and pulled out the cell.
�Hallo ?�
There was a pause. Then the line went dead. Number withheld.
He frowned. There are moments in your life when you see the future. Nick sometimes knew that his beloved Manchester United were going to lose a match even before the game was played. As a student, he&#8217;d once won several hundred pounds at roulette because he just knew for certain that number &#8216;13&#8217; was coming up next. Right now, he felt a cold, clammy shiver up his spine.
He heard Naomi still washing in the shower.
He couldn&#8217;t stop himself. He pressed a couple of buttons and pulled up the Call Register. Then he selected &#8216;dialled numbers&#8217;. He scrolled through. Most were identified as names from the Contacts List; her mum, Kelly, other girlfriends, himself, a few random numbers. Then one identified as Jxxx. The most recent time she had dialled the number was 11.27 that morning. While he had been doing housework and Naomi had been out in the garden.
Fingers clumsy, he selected &#8216;received calls&#8217;. The call that he had just answered was from Jxxx ! He quickly checked &#8216;missed calls&#8217;. The one before he hadn&#8217;t answered had also been from Jxxx.
Nick shut his eyes.
He heard the water go silent and the shower door opening.
Now or never.
He hit the green phone, watched the word &#8216;calling&#8217; appear and the number on the display. His heart was hammering. The phone rang twice.
�Hi !� Said an excited voice.
He didn&#8217;t speak. Couldn&#8217;t speak.
�Nao ?�
It was male, vaguely familiar, and clearly on close terms with his wife.
He raised his arm high and then very deliberately threw the phone at the antique, gilt framed mirror in the hall. A gift from Naomi&#8217;s parents. It shattered into a million shards. Just like his heart.
He knew that voice.
Jack.

When they returned from the beach, the contractor gave them a big, gold-toothed grin. Dylan handed him an envelope of &#8216;overtime cash&#8217;. The cellar was finished.
It was a piece of art. A twelve feet by twelve feet square room, by twelve feet high, made of rock, concrete and a rubber liner on the floor, walls and ceiling. It was as safe as a padded cell, virtually sound proof, certainly escape proof.
There were &#8211; for the moment anyway &#8211; no wine bins. No wine even. The solitary items of furniture were a flat screen monitor mounted on the wall, and an adjustable St. Andrew&#8217;s &#8216;x&#8217; cross, secured to the floor and set at a convenient angle.
An hour later, Mart was spread eagled naked on the wooden cross, his wrists, chest, waist and ankles all secured by nylon cord.
Kelly smiled at him, reached out to stroke his naked nipples, his uncaged dick. She had been waiting for this moment for weeks.
�Don&#8217;t worry, my love. We won&#8217;t forget you down here. You won&#8217;t die.�
She idly cupped his balls in her fingers, weighing their frustration. How long had it been since Mart had orgasmed ? She had no idea. Weeks ? Months ? She felt like an ex-smoker who suddenly realises that the habit is history.
�But you will suffer, Mart. This is your big test. I know you&#8217;ve been wondering how much more you can take. I can see it in your lovely green eyes. Well, it&#8217;s like the Gerecke. Sometimes you need help going beyond what you think you are capable of. So think of your time down here in this cell as being like a chastity device for your whole body.�
She slowly eased her fingernails away from teasing his scrotum.
�For your mind too. Goodbye, my love. Have fun down here !�
There were narrow stone steps on the side wall, up to a hatch. She walked up slowly, enjoying the sense of his eyes on her retreating legs.
�Kel&#8217;.� She heard him croak. �How lo � long ?�
She smiled and put her index finger to her lips. �Ssshhh ��

The closing of the hatch automatically opened four air vents. The cellar was highly sophisticated. There was an air quality detector, water supply, plumbing, microphones, cameras and lights. But Kelly left Mart in the dark to ponder on what she&#8217;d said.
She pulled a small rug and bedside table over the hatch door, rendering it invisible. Then she smiled at Dylan who was lying on the bed.
�Come here.� He said, blowing her a kiss.
She lay down next to him.
�Just the two of us.�
He turned and kissed her. �The beach was funny.�
She sighed. �Kind of.�
He made a face. �Sorry.�
She kissed him back. �Don&#8217;t worry. It&#8217;s just I&#8217;ve been looking forward to this. I find it difficult sometimes, keeping my head straight. It&#8217;s not easy you know � two men.�
Dylan reached out to fondle her breasts, sliding his palm down her thigh.
�What do you want ?�
She shrugged. �Time.�
�Time ?�
She felt her body softening, relaxing, responding. �Mmm ��
�You want to stick to the plan ?�
�Yesssss �� she sighed.
 �Want to give him a show ?�
�More than that.�
He raised an eyebrow. �Meaning ?�
�Please do me in the ass, Dyl&#8217;. Now. I want to try it. Make Mart watch me give you something he&#8217;s never had. Never will have.�
�Wow, Kel&#8217;. You sure ?�
�As eggs are eggs. Do me. Before I change my mind !�

Mart was not exactly uncomfortable, but he was hardly relaxing either.
Then suddenly the 16:9 monitor in front of him flickered to life. It took a couple of seconds but he realised he was looking at the bedroom above his head; Kelly and Mart&#8217;s room. Their bed.
His wife was lying in the centre of the bed with her legs splayed up in the air above her head. Dylan was holding her calves, thrusting gently between her thighs.
Hidden speakers crackled into life and then he could hear every sound as if they were in the cellar with him. Loud and clear.
�Yes � yes � yes �� Kelly was chanting.
�Mmmmmmmmm �� Dylan chorused in a continuous moan.
Kelly&#8217;s tits were bouncing from side to side.
�Oh it&#8217;s so fuuuul �� she shrieked, �� my ass.�
Mart did a double take. He tilted his head to look at a different angle.
�Your virgin ass.� Dylan hissed. �All mine.�
It was true. He could see that now.
Kelly was doing something that she&#8217;d said she would never do.

Just as Dylan was in the throes of his orgasm, the phone rang.
�Leave it.� He grimaced.
But Kelly hadn&#8217;t been able to ignore the phone since Chantal was born. A mother&#8217;s instinct. She twisted her head to look at her cell which was lying sideways on the bedside table. The Caller Display said &#8216;Naomi&#8217;.
She felt Dylan&#8217;s dick twitching, filling the condom. They didn&#8217;t use rubbers usually but this time was for hygienic reasons not safe sex. It was strange being unable to feel his hot fluid. To be honest, anal sex had been a bit of a let down. Not as bad as she&#8217;d feared and not as exciting as she&#8217;d hoped.
What was that strapline from Mart&#8217;s favourite movie ? Fear can keep you prisoner but hope can set you free.
She wondered what he&#8217;d thought watching her on the monitor.
The phone finally stopped ringing and voicemail clicked in.
She&#8217;d call Naomi back later.
After all, it was unlikely to be anything important.

FIVE WORDS



Part Eleven: May


Mart had lost track of time.
In the dark silence of the cellar, day was night, and minutes were indistinguishable from hours. He lay there listening to the beating of his heart and the echoes of silence.
Regret is a dish best left uneaten.
He was stretched on the St. Andrew&#8217;s cross, his limbs fully extended but not overstretched. The main discomfort was from lying in the same position for so long and the void in his empty stomach. At least Dylan had tilted the angle of the cross so that he was lying horizontally.
Dylan.
He hadn&#8217;t seen Kelly since she had bade him goodbye, and told him to have fun down here. Since then, he had been &#8216;looked after&#8217; solely by Dylan. Mart guessed that he had been locked down here at least 72 hours, but maybe it was already four days, or even more. In that time, Dylan had paid him just four brief visits.

Sometime later, he wasn&#8217;t sure how long, his semi-conscious reverie was disturbed by the clunk of the ceiling hatch, the sound of footsteps on the stone steps, then the flicker of the overhead lights coming on. Dylan smiled that nauseating smug grin at him again. He was carrying a bowl in one hand and a flash of steel in the other.
�Hi Mart. Sleep okay ?�
Mart was silent. He turned his gaze to the concrete wall.
Dylan ignored the rebuff and chuckled cheerfully.
�Let&#8217;s get your bib on shall we ?�
It evidently amused Dylan to call the mouth-ring a &#8216;bib&#8217;. It was a steel and rubber spider gag that held Mart&#8217;s jaws wide open for feeding.
But Mart knew he had no choice. The first time he had refused, Dylan had simply shrugged, turned tail and left. At first it was thirst but now the hunger pangs were kicking in to a similar degree.
He opened up his parched lips as wide as his jaws allowed.
Dylan nodded approvingly and quickly inserted the gag, allowing the spring clip to snap open before Mart could change his mind. Mart had grown several days of beard round his mouth and along his jaw line.
�There&#8217;s a good lad.�
Mart knew better than to try to reply. The gag made attempting to utter intelligible noises a totally humiliating waste of time.
Dylan&#8217;s eyes smiled down at him, clearly enjoying his helplessness. Mart&#8217;s legs, groin, torso, arms and mouth were defenceless. He was naked and afraid, his dick shrivelled by fear and the underground chill.
Dylan sniffed, his aquiline nostrils flaring with amused distaste.
�You really must control yourself mate.�
Mart had peed several times in the dark. His own urine had sprayed up onto his stomach and then dribbled down his sides to puddle and dry on the floor. Fortunately he had not yet needed to use the bucket placed under the x of the cross for &#8216;solids&#8217;.
Dylan placed a hand on Mart&#8217;s beating chest. Then, with a smirk, he slowly trailed a finger down over his ribs, his waist, to his groin. There were tiny bristles of pubic stubble that had grown since he had last been shaved.
�Not feeling horny ?�
He stepped into the v of the cross between Mart&#8217;s thighs and casually handled each of Mart&#8217;s testicles in turn, separating them.
�Don&#8217;t worry, mate. I&#8217;m not gay, as you know. But I&#8217;m comfortable enough in my own masculinity that handling a dick doesn&#8217;t worry me.�
Fingers began teasing Mart&#8217;s penis, lingering on his inner thighs.
�Just relax. Let it happen. How long is it since you came ?�
Mart simply stared sullenly. Even he had lost count.
Dylan shrugged. �Weeks, huh ? Months ?�
He felt nothing but, in spite of that, his thighs tensed and blood started to flow. Very slowly his penis thickened and became more sensitive.
�I remember when I first saw you naked.� Dylan said, looking down with a satisfied grin. �It was after rugby. You have nothing to be ashamed of mate. It ain&#8217;t what I&#8217;d call big but it&#8217;s not a tiny one either.�
Mart felt his cheeks blushing hot. Dylan was masturbating him now. Actually manipulating his shaft in a casual jack-off manner.
�Ngahahgh ..� he tried to object through the gag.
Dylan simply laughed. �Oh don&#8217;t be silly ! Beggars can&#8217;t be choosers. This is as good as it&#8217;s going to get, mate. It&#8217;s my hand or nothing.�
It had been so long. It was true. He felt his hips shift in a reflex response.
Immediately, the fingers were pulled away leaving him high and dry.
�Nmahngh ..�
Dylan chuckled again. He had evidently made his point. He licked the ends of his fingers suggestively and used the tips on Mart&#8217;s sensitive ridge, enough to arouse, but way too slowly to induce orgasm.
�Before she left, Kelly said you&#8217;d be up for it.�
Mart&#8217;s brow creased. Left ? His brain shifted from his groin.
�Yes.� Dylan said, letting his erection drop. �She&#8217;s gone to England for a few days. Business to attend to. Something about legal documents and money. She left me in sole charge of you, Marty boy.�
�Nmmgn ?�
�What ? I&#8217;m sorry mate, I didn&#8217;t understand you.�
He bent down and picked up the bowl from the floor. Mart caught a glimpse of the contents. The spoon appeared to be standing on its own in the thick, glutinous mush. Dylan sidled up to stand by Mart&#8217;s chest.
�Mmm �� he sniffed the bowl appreciatively. �Hungry ?�
Very slowly, Mart moved his head up and down twice.
�I fixed this for you myself. Loads of good stuff.�
Mart watched the spoon descend in slow motion. He felt the steel against his stretched lips and saw Dylan&#8217;s quizzical stare as he tipped the first mouthful onto his tongue.
There was no distinct smell, just a whiff of earthiness. The first things he noticed were the lukewarm temperature and the texture as it assailed his tongue like a slug. It gurgled into the back of his throat and trickled down. Mart couldn&#8217;t swallow or speed up the process due to the gag. Eventually, came the taste; salty and bitter and rancid, like a two day old bin&#8217;s contents that had been liquidized and recycled.
Mart retched, almost bringing up the whole lot. Somehow he managed to keep it all down, acid burning the back of his throat.
Dylan nodded approvingly. �Well done.�
He immediately lifted another spoonful to Mart&#8217;s mouth.

While he fed him, Dylan talked. It was almost a speech, as if he had prepared the words, ready for this moment.
�I want you to know that I&#8217;ve nothing against you mate. I&#8217;m doing this for you. You want this, Kelly wants this. You&#8217;re my friend and I will never squeeze you out. Heck, I like having you along for the ride. So long as you learn your place, you&#8217;re welcome in our lives. Forever if necessary. I know you&#8217;re not enjoying this too much at the moment. But as I&#8217;ve just proved with your dick, it&#8217;s a question of � training. In the end you&#8217;ll learn to respond to it. Until now, you&#8217;ve been in your comfort zone. But since we came to Portugal, Kelly and I wanted to take you beyond comfort, to ��
He gestured round the cellar with the spoon.
�� this. Welcome, my friend to your new life.�
Mart felt it and tried to suppress it. But there was nothing he could do. The bitterness of the taste in his mouth. A single, salty tear trickled out of the corner of his eye and down the side of his face.
�Oh.� Dylan said. �Don&#8217;t cry. This is all for a purpose. Once you&#8217;ve learned to think and behave like a true slave, not just a self indulgent cuck, we&#8217;ll let you out of here to serve us properly. We were all born for this. You, Kelly, me. This was always our destiny, we just didn&#8217;t know it back then. That&#8217;s what makes it all so powerful and delicious now.�
His words flowed into Mart&#8217;s brain like the gunk into his gullet. He didn&#8217;t react. Just lay there and ate. Only later would he digest them.
�I want you to know something, Mart. Something serious. I love her. I&#8217;m not doing this to get at you or to exploit her. I&#8217;m not interested in your money like James was, or just in casual sex like Jack. I truly love Kelly. So you can take comfort she&#8217;ll be in good hands. I&#8217;ll look after her. And I&#8217;ll look after you as well.� He smiled, scraping the last remnants from the bowl. �So long as you play your cards right !�

Another day passed. Or what seemed like a day. Maybe it was less ? Or more. He lay in the dark, in the stinking cellar, unable to get the bitter taste of the slop from his mouth or the words from his mind.
He had so much time to think. She&#8217;s gone to England, business to attend to. So long as you learn your place you&#8217;re welcome in our lives. I&#8217;ll look after you as well if you play your cards right. I&#8217;m not interested in your money or casual sex. I truly love Kelly. 
The ceiling hatch opened and Dylan appeared. Mart squinted at him as his eyes got used to the searing light.
�Please � Dylan �� he gasped, �� no more !�
�Pfaw, Mart. What a disgusting stink !�
They each ignored each other&#8217;s words.
�Dylan � !� Mart managed to shout.
�Well at least you got it into the bucket.� Dylan replied.
�This has to stop&nbsp; � now !� His voice gave out into a high pitched croak.
Dylan looked at him, his expression switching from amused annoyance to genuine rage.
�Shut the fuck up, Mart !�
They stared. Eyes burning. Mart had raised his neck up so that his head was straight, as if that somehow made him more of an equal. He blinked first.
Dylan was dressed in an open towelling robe. His swimming trunks and hair were wet, fresh from the swimming pool.
�You want me to empty this bucket ? Or you want me to tip it over your head ?�
Mart sighed, stifling tears of frustration. �Empty.�
�Empty what ?�
�Empty it � please � Sir.�
Dylan nodded, calming down. �Okay. But a little test first.� He fished into his robe pocket and produced the gag. �Open up.�
The threat was obvious. It hung in the air like a bad odour.
Slowly, he parted his lips.
�Wider.�
Dylan skilfully inserted the steel jaws into Mart&#8217;s mouth and released the spring. Then he reached down to the floor and picked up the bucket, peering into it disdainfully.
Without warning, he seized Mart&#8217;s hair with his other hand, holding his head completely still.
Mart tried to wriggle away but couldn&#8217;t. It was too painful.
�Nngghhaah ��
�If I didn&#8217;t think you deserved one more chance mate, I&#8217;d shove all this down your filthy throat. Got that ?�
Mart stared up at him. Their faces were only three inches apart.
Dylan had won yet another round. He knew it.
Mart knew it.

There was a break of a minute or two while Dylan carried the bucket up the steps out of the cellar. In the distance, Mart thought he could just hear the sound of flushing. Then he appeared with the bucket smelling of some strong disinfectant. He plonked it back down under Mart&#8217;s waist.
�You stink. Your breath smells, you ass is dirty and you need to shave.�
Mart gave a slight nod. He couldn&#8217;t argue with any of that.
�Luckily we thought of all that.�
There was a panel in the wall. He watched Dylan release the catch to reveal a coil of green hose and a dark plug hole in the floor.
The water was icy and it took his breath away, making him gasp through the gag. Dylan sprayed his legs, body, arms and face, before applying the nozzle to his anus. Then he used a plastic bottle to spray Mart&#8217;s body with liquid soap, finally hosing him clean again with the cold water.
�We&#8217;ll do your teeth and shave you tomorrow.�
Mart&#8217;s mind was numb. He lay shivering on the wooden x frame.
�In the meantime ��
He watched transfixed, as this man &#8211; who he&#8217;d thought he&#8217;d known well, his one time best friend, his Best Man, but now his wife&#8217;s lover, his tormentor in chief &#8211; lowered his damp swimming trunks and revealed his penis.
It was like a coil of flesh coloured hose nestling in a dark mass of hair.
Slowly, arrogantly, without a word, Dylan started massaging himself. He was already semi-hard and he quickly lengthened and thickened.
�Here it is, Mart. Kelly&#8217;s favourite toy. You&#8217;ve already had a taste of what it has to offer. But in Kelly&#8217;s absence, you&#8217;re going to get it straight from the horse&#8217;s dick, so to speak.�
Mart shook his head, shutting his eyes. He couldn&#8217;t look.
�Open your eyes ! Unless you want me to piss in them.�
He opened up and looked at Dylan&#8217;s strong fist pumping his swollen crown two inches from the gag, four inches from his eyes.
�When I cum, you keep that mouth wide open in this direction.�
Dylan&#8217;s hand was a blur, the purple piss-slit moving hypnotically in his face. It went on for a couple of minutes, a strange ritual of dominance and submission. Eventually Mart recognised telltale pre-orgasmic grunts.
�Oh � yesssssss � mmmmmm ��
Thick pearly jets shot and uncoiled like an exploding cream cake all over Mart&#8217;s face. He tried to avert his eyes but felt Dylan&#8217;s strong left hand behind his head, gripping his hair. He tasted plenty on his tongue but there was more spattering his forehead, nose, a cheek, his chin.
�Phew �� Dylan exhaled, grinning, �� you make a good tissue.� He wiped his fingers over Mart&#8217;s chest and pulled up his trunks.
�You&#8217;d better lay here and pray your missus gets back soon to look after me properly, or I might have to start using you in other ways. I&#8217;ll be back later to remove the gag � if you&#8217;re good.�

Kelly looked up enquiringly when Dylan walked out to the pool deck.
He pulled off his robe and slumped down along one of the empty sun beds.
�And ?� she asked.
�All going to plan.�
She shut her eyes. All going to plan. Easy to say, difficult to be sure.
�What did you do ?�
He shrugged and tilted his head. �Cleaned him up. He&#8217;d used the bucket. It smelt foul down there. I&#8217;ve got to shave him and brush his teeth tomorrow.�
There was a silence. Dylan glanced over at the other sun beds. �Where are the lovebirds ?�
Kelly made a face. �Where do you think ?�
As if on cue, a female shriek tore through the open window. Naomi was the noisiest tart on the planet. When she was having a good time she wanted the whole world to know. Or maybe that&#8217;s what she wanted everybody to think.
�Aaaah, Jack, ngghm � yes � yes � oh � yessssss ��
Dylan rolled his eyes. �Lucky the builders have left for the day.�
�She dragged him indoors as soon as they closed the gate.�
It was true. Naomi had arrived with Jack two days earlier. She and Nick were divorcing. No negotiations, no discussions, no attempts to save their marriage. Unfortunately Nao thought she was in love with Jack.
Worse, she even thought that Jack loved her.
Kelly pushed her sunglasses back down over her eyes.
She felt some guilt. But Nao hadn&#8217;t taken her advice. This Fem Dom thing isn&#8217;t a child&#8217;s game. And especially if cuckolding is involved. It should carry one of those warnings like cigarette packets.
Fucking other men can seriously damage your marriage.
She glanced over at Dylan&#8217;s handsome profile soaking up the late afternoon sun. His nose was elegant, lips masculine, jaw line firm.
She adored fucking him. But that&#8217;s what it was. F u c k i n g. It wasn&#8217;t making love. Mart was the only man she&#8217;d ever made love to. He was almost definitely the only man she ever would make love to.
Even if she never did so again.

Jack watched Naomi thrashing around on top of him like a rag doll. Beads of perspiration flew off her forehead as she rode him to her third shrieking climax. He gritted his teeth and postponed his own orgasm.
He knew this relationship was only going to last a few more days. He was still scared of any sort of commitment and, frankly, Naomi wasn&#8217;t his type. Besides, he had no intention of getting caught up in a messy divorce case.
But he knew that if he played his cards right, he could have himself some fun. A few hot memories for the cold winter nights to come.
Unlike Kelly who knew what she wanted, Naomi only thought she did.
She would do whatever he wanted to try to impress him with her rampant sexuality and open mind. So it was time to try some new things.
Give her something to really shriek about !

Mart stretched and rotated his jaw to try to regain its feeling.
Dylan folded the spider gag and popped it in his pocket.
�May I sp � speak � Sir.�
Dylan smiled as if it was the most normal thing in the world. �Sure mate.�
�I surrender. I wave the white flag. I will do � whatever � Sir.�
Dylan beamed. �Really ? You mean that ?�
Mart nodded. His mouth was parched, stiff and sore.
And it was true. At least he thought it was. Like even the most resistant captive, he had his breaking point. The interrogator had worn him down. He had answered their questions, truthfully as far as he knew.
�Kelly will be absolutely thrilled.�
Five Words. Like the fingers of a hand encircling his heart.
�You have some papers to sign. You&#8217;ll be out of here in a day or two.�
Dylan smiled at Mart, reading his expression of concern.
�Nothing much. Just our marriage certificate. You&#8217;re the Best Man this time. Our witness. Other legal and financial stuff. Make it watertight.�
�But ��
�It has to be irrevocable. No comebacks, Mart.�
Mart shut his eyes. Was this really what he&#8217;d signed up for last July ?
�Hey !� Dylan said, excitedly. �Look.� He took a folded piece of paper out of his pocket. It was glossy, torn from a magazine.
There, on the page, was a bright red car. A sleek sports car. Mart was no expert but he could recognise a black horse on a yellow badge.
A Ferrari.
�It&#8217;s a 1987 Testarossa.� Dylan enthused. �Four point nine litres, twelve cylinders, twenty years old. A thing of beauty, isn&#8217;t it ?�
Mart smiled weakly, fearing where this was going.
�A wedding present from my wife to be. And my Best Man too, I guess. I know I said I&#8217;m not after Kelly for your money but, hey, you don&#8217;t say no to the perks.�
Mart bowed his head.
�Don&#8217;t worry. You won&#8217;t need money. We&#8217;ll give you what you need.�
What was that website ? In the days when he&#8217;d been able to jack off in front of his PC, Mart had once joined a site called RPP. That&#8217;s how he felt now; raped, pillaged and plundered.
Dylan put the piece of paper carefully back in his pocket.
�Hey mate, gotta dash for supper. Kelly&#8217;s arriving any minute. I can&#8217;t wait to tell her the great news !�

That night, after supper, they left Jack and Naomi cuddled on the sofa watching &#8216;The Queen&#8217; starring Helen Mirren, a new DVD that Kelly and Dylan had already watched. In truth, she was kind of fed up with Naomi&#8217;s constant yapping anyway.
�So,� she said, climbing into bed, �what is tomorrow&#8217;s plan ?�
Dylan reached for her. �Mmm � give a kiss to your best man and let&#8217;s discuss that later.�
She placed his hand firmly back by his side. �No, let&#8217;s talk now.�
He sighed. �He&#8217;s ready, Kel&#8217;. You can play it whichever way you want. It&#8217;s up to you. You can have your husband back. Or a � well, whatever you want to call him. A slave. I&#8217;m 99% certain he&#8217;ll go along with either.�
She wished she felt so confident.
Dylan reached for her again. His hand squeezed her boob greedily.
She turned her face and looked at him. It wasn&#8217;t worth fighting.
For ten minutes, Dylan thrust and grunted on top of her, until he moaned in orgasm, while she kissed his ear and hissed in fake ecstasy.
In reality, Kelly was staring at the ceiling, thinking about her future.
And her husband.


Mart watched Kelly teasing Dylan&#8217;s helmet with her tongue like a slut from a porn movie. He was so close to them both that he could see the thin strand of saliva stretching from Dylan&#8217;s purple plum to her scarlet lips. Dylan was grinning down at him, his glazed eyes half-closed in bliss, a hand holding Kelly&#8217;s hair back so that it didn&#8217;t obscure Mart&#8217;s view.
�Luckily your missus is back to look after me properly,� Dylan chuckled.
Mart woke with a jerk. He didn&#8217;t know where he was and then, moments later, it all came back. He felt cold, clammy sweat under his neck.
It might have been morning. But it might have been any time of day.
He drifted in and out of consciousness, afraid to go back to sleep.
Frightened of the dreams that tormented him.

Light suddenly flooded the cellar. He heard footsteps. The swish of slippers on stone. Kelly ! He turned his head and squinted against the light.
She smiled at him. She was carrying a steaming mug. It smelt of coffee.
�Hi darling.�
�Mm.� He replied, coldly.
She pouted. �That&#8217;s not much of a welcome.�
He shut his eyes, didn&#8217;t reply.
She walked alongside him, surveying. �You look a mess, Mart.�
�I feel a fucking mess.�
�If you swear once more I shall leave.�
No. Please.
He sighed. �Sorry.�
She was dressed in just a silk dressing gown and lingerie. He could make out the ivory coloured lace of her camisole. Her hair was tied up in a tousled bun on her head and her skin was tanned and glowing. He watched her blow and then take a delicate sip from her coffee mug.
�I warned you.�
He gave the merest nod of recognition.
�This is your big test.�
�Did I pass ?� he asked sarcastically.
�Not the way you&#8217;re behaving now.�
There was a silence. She took another taste of coffee.
�Where is he ?�
�Dylan ?� She looked into his eyes. �He&#8217;s gone.�
�Like he&#8217;d gone when I was tied on your bed in England ?�
�That was a tease, Mart. I&#8217;m not in the mood for teases now.�
�Nor am I.�
She turned away. �I can see you need some more time to cool down.�
�No. Please. I&#8217;m sorry.�
But he could see he&#8217;d pissed her off. She walked to the steps.
�I&#8217;ll be back in a few hours. I want you to lie here and do some serious thinking, Mart ��
�Wait. Please. Can you at least tell me if you&#8217;ve married him ?�
He watched her expression change for anger to amusement, a slow softening of her features into a sly smile.
�Is that what he told you ?�
�Yes.�
She paused, shaking her head in quiet enjoyment.
�No Mart. I did not marry Dylan.� She said. �I&#8217;m married to you.�
He let out a stifled sob of relief.
�As I was saying,� she continued, �do some serious thinking about the past ten months. Is any of this really my fault ? Honestly. Can you truly say I&#8217;m in the wrong here ? When I come back down, I want to know. How does this end, Mart ? Tell me, &#8216;cos it&#8217;s tearing me apart.�

Dylan was speaking on his cell phone when she walked back into the kitchen. He winked and signalled he was nearly finished talking.
Naomi and Jack were sat at the table eating fruit with their fingers.
Kelly put her coffee down and helped herself to a segment of orange.
Naomi raised an eyebrow. �Did it go okay ?�
She tilted her hand to and fro. So-so, at best.
Dylan closed his phone. At that moment, a car horn sounded.
�Taxi&#8217;s here.�
Jack and Dylan walked over to the pile of bags in the hall.
Naomi took Kelly&#8217;s hand. �I thought you said that one&#8217;s a keeper ?� she muttered, staring with Kelly at Dylan&#8217;s tight butt in his denim jeans.
�Depends what you mean by keeper.� She sighed. You just don&#8217;t get it do you Nao ? �I said it had to be a threesome.�
Dylan walked over, bags over his broad shoulders.
�I&#8217;ll call you when we land.�
She leaned up to kiss him full on the lips.
�I love you.� She murmured into his ear.
�No you don&#8217;t.� he whispered back. �I&#8217;m your best man and you like me very, very much.�
He laughed, holding her shoulders, his glistening eyes fixed on hers.
�But there is only one man you truly love�.

What makes for a happy ending ?
Mart lay in the dark and pondered the same question he&#8217;d already spent hours on to pass the time. It&#8217;s easy to define a sad ending; the hero dies, the couple don&#8217;t consummate their love, the mission is a valiant failure. Whatever.
But a happy ending ? It depends what the main protagonists truly want ? And even now, he knew that deep down he wasn&#8217;t certain what he really wanted. What Kelly truly, madly, deeply desired.
A happy ending of a book or film ends with the implication that, after the final page or the closing titles, everybody lives happily ever after. Maybe the characters&#8217; happiness will be ruined as soon as the curtain falls ? After all, we know that one day the grim reaper will cause inevitable sadness. 
His problem was that he wasn&#8217;t reading Chantal her bedtime story or watching a romantic comedy with Kelly.
He was living the story.
Fuck it, he WAS the story.

He stood on the shower and soaked himself for five long minutes in the steaming hot spray. Then he shaved his itching groin and stubbly jaw carefully, before scrubbing his teeth until his gums ached, and rinsing with mouthwash. Finally, he put on a T-shirt, shorts and flip-flops that Kelly had laid out for him.
She met him on the pool deck, holding out a glass of pink champagne.
�Sit.� She said, gesturing to one of the two chairs under the sun umbrella.
His mind went back to the warm evening when they had sat on a similar sultry evening and watched the sunset; Saturday, 8th July 2006.
�I&#8217;m sorry.� He said. �For earlier.�
She had finally released him curtly an hour before. �Get yourself cleaned up first.� The tension between them both was still palpable.
�Don&#8217;t worry.� She touched his arm. �I can understand it now.�
�Dylan told me that you and he were marrying. That you&#8217;d gone over to England to sign papers and stuff.�
�Dylan was just doing his job.�
�Dylan is a total bastard !� he spat.
She looked at him, taking her time, as if to underline her sincerity.
�No, Mart. That&#8217;s where you&#8217;re wrong. There may be villains in this story, but Dylan isn&#8217;t one of them.�
She still loves him.
�Well I bloody well hate him anyway.�
Kelly smiled, reaching up to stroke his cheek.
�That was his idea. His plan.�
Plan ? Mart stared at her, pausing to sip his champagne.
�I won&#8217;t lie to you Mart. We had fun too. But Dylan convinced me that if he could make you hate what was happening, really and truly hate it, then you would want your old life back. He knew that it would cost him your friendship. He knew that it would cost him � our friendship too. But that was a sacrifice he was prepared to make.�
There was a tear in her eyes. Mart reached up to wipe it.
�He used to say that was what any Best Man should do. Anything to get the groom and bride together.�
He chose a strange way to do it !
That&#8217;s what Mart thought to say, but the words didn&#8217;t leave his lips.
�You mean � he planned it all from the beginning. Treating me like shit.�
It had worked.
She flicked another tear from her cheek. 
�Yes, Mart. If you want to blame anybody, blame me. I offered myself to Dylan. It was him who actually saw it as an opportunity to help us.�
�And did he help us ?�
The five words hung in the air. The sun chose that moment to melt below the horizon, lengthening the evening shadows.
She smiled, no longer crying. �I think he did. I hope he did.�
�You said you would offer me the choice to go back to how we were.�
�I did.�
�Does your offer still stand ?�

Later in bed, lying on crisp white new sheets, Mart lay spreadeagled in an &#8216;x&#8217; position. But this time his wrists and ankles were untied, just held there by willpower.
Kelly was teasing him, stroking his flat stomach, muscular legs and hardened body. She ran her nails erotically up his inner thighs, probing the tender folds where the tops of his legs met his hairless scrotum. 
�I can&#8217;t bear it � please ��
�Sssshhh ��
Her fingers danced like butterflies along his tortured shaft, making it jerk and twitch in the vein of a machine-gunned body.
�Hey,� she whispered, �do you know what a &#8216;happy ending&#8217; is ?�
�Mngh �I � it&#8217;s when everybody lives � h � happily ever after.�
He was so near now. His spine arched off the bed.
Her giggle was a nice sound. Not taunting and unkind, but sweet and loving. Her hand tugged up and down on his most sensitive ridge.
�No, Mart. &#8216;Happy ending&#8217; in slang. I&#8217;m surprised you haven&#8217;t heard of it.�
He reached the point of no return. His legs locked in stages; feet, ankles, knees, thighs, groin. He was cumming, great waves of pleasure broke like tsunami across his chest, shoulders, neck, exploding into his skull.
�This �� she said, over his groan of release, �� is what a masseuse calls a &#8216;happy ending&#8217;, my love.�
He felt a spurt landing on his neck and fell exhausted back onto the mattress, aware of the hot dampness splashing his chest and stomach. And suddenly Kelly had thrown herself on top of him, planting kisses on his face, her camisole wet and sticking between them.
�You&#8217;re stuck to me, I&#8217;m afraid.� She laughed.
He joined in with her laughter.
No, you&#8217;re stuck with me. Was it really so simple to write off what had happened ? Could he simply have his old job back, just like that ?
It was as if she had read his mind. Her flashing eyes narrowed.
�Let&#8217;s just find out darling, shall we ? We&#8217;ll see what happens over the next few months. No more plans. No more analysis.�
He put his arms round her and hugged her tight.
�You know what ? Maybe it would help if I wrote it all down ?�



End of Part Eleven
To be finished in Part Twelve
(June to the Present Day)










FIVE WORDS



Part Twelve:


June



&#8216;Just Five Words. The five words that changed his life. The handful of words that turned him from a husband, father and successful businessman into something else entirely.&#8217;
He scanned carefully through the lines on the screen again.
�Hey, love. Listen to this.�
He read the opening synopsis out aloud for her approval.
�Sounds a bit dramatic doesn&#8217;t it ?� she replied.
�Yeah, a bit. But you&#8217;ve got to grab the readers by the balls, so to speak.�
She laughed, stirring the pan of soup she was heating up for them.
�Into something else entirely � whooo � spooky. A werewolf !�
He grinned back. He was sat in front of the laptop at the kitchen table.
�Listen to the rest. This is the true story of a man who really did live the dream that many male submissives think they would like to turn into reality. Ignore that baloney about it all being fiction in the disclaimer above.�
�Dream ?� she said. �Or nightmare ?�
�I think &#8216;dream&#8217; is better in the opening context. Let the readers decide for themselves later if it&#8217;s a wet dream or a horrible nightmare.�
�Okay. You&#8217;re the writer not me.� She tasted the soup off her wooden spoon. �What about names ? Have you made a final decision ?�
He smiled, touching his fingertips to his chest. �Meet Mart.�
�Mart ? As in Martin ?�
�I guess. Or Walmart ! I just like the abbreviated name. Short and suggestively � wimpish.�
�And ?� she pointed her finger to her bosom.
�I&#8217;ve got several ideas. But � I prefer Kelly. Sort of in tribute to Mrs. Emma Kelly and her legendary blog.�
She pouted, nodding her head from side to side, weighing it up.
�Kelly � mmm, I like it. Kelly and Mart. Suits us.�
He turned back to the screen, reading aloud again.
�Kelly and Mart are actual people and the events certainly happened, pretty much exactly as laid out here.�
She smiled, pouring their soup into two bowls.
�I think that &#8216;based on actual events&#8217; would be more accurate.�
�Nah !� he chuckled. �I&#8217;m going to write it exactly as I see it.�
And so it began.
On the last day of June 2007, he finished the first Chapter of their story. The words achieved precisely what he had hoped for. They triggered the process of catharsis that he needed to complete the cycle.
He had written the beginning.
He knew the middle.
But he still didn&#8217;t know quite which way it would end.


July

Kelly arrived home late afternoon from spending a day out with Naomi and another girlfriend. She shook the umbrella on the doorstep. England was suffering its wettest, most miserable summer during her lifetime.
�Hi.� She called out. �I&#8217;m home !�
There was no answer.
Mart was sat at the PC. He was unshaven, still in his dressing gown, staring at the screen. He turned slowly to look up at her in a daze.
�Hi.� She repeated, shaking her head at his gaunt, dishevelled appearance.
�Umm � hi.� He responded robotically.
�Good day ?� she asked.
�Huh ?�
She walked up and patted him on the head. �Earth to Mart.�
�� I&#8217;ve finished.�
�What ? No ! Already ?�
He sighed. �Yep. All 70,000 words of it.�
�Wow.�
She fingered the sheets of paper stacked high in the laser printer.
�Can I read it ?�
He put his arms round her waist and nestled his head against her tummy.
�I think you&#8217;d better wait until you&#8217;ve got a drink in your hand.�

Later, much later, around midnight, she reached the ending.
The final words that revealed the truth.
She&#8217;d drunk two vodka slimlines and a bottle of white wine in the process. Yet her brain was totally clear, as if the alcohol had been absorbed by the emotion, filtered out through her kidneys and bladder.
So that&#8217;s how it was.
Five words. 


August


The email looked just like any other. They both enjoyed receiving the regular feedback, reactions and comments from readers. &#8216;Wake up and smell the coffee, Mart&#8217;, was the most common reaction, although &#8216;treat him mean to keep him keen&#8217; came a close second.
That morning there were 7 new emails and it was the last one he opened.
He read it through once, then a second time. Then a third. He called Kelly over.
�What do you reckon ?� he asked.
�Sounds like it might be genuine but � wow !�
�No rush. Let&#8217;s go make some coffee.�

In fact, the man was totally genuine and so was his email.
Mart and he exchanged correspondence for three days. Gradually Mart began feeling more comfortable with the idea of taking it to the next stage.
&#8216;Give me a phone number and I&#8217;ll call you at a pre-arranged time.&#8217;
The number arrived by return. It had a 1-prefix for USA, and a 323-city code, plus 7 more digits.
At exactly 6 p.m. - 10 a.m in California - Mart dialled the number on a cash pre-paid phone so that it couldn&#8217;t be traced to his real identity.
�Hi.�
�Mart.� Said the honey-smooth voice. �Shall I call you Mart ?�
�Yeah, that&#8217;s fine.�
�It&#8217;s good to put a voice to your words, Mart. Your Five Words.�
�It&#8217;s good to speak to you too.�
�I enjoyed your story a lot, Mart. And so did a couple of my associates. As I mentioned in my email, we&#8217;d like to discuss making your story come alive. We think it could make a great movie.�
�That&#8217;s what I wanted to talk about. You see, Kelly and I have discussed it and we really don&#8217;t want our love life made � you know � sordid. Of course the idea is flattering but � well, wouldn&#8217;t this be a porn movie ?�
Kelly was sat on the sofa listening. She stuck a thumb up in support.
�No. Heck no, Mart. I haven&#8217;t been using my real name either Mart. I don&#8217;t know how much you know about the film industry ��
�Not much.�
� � well, put it like this, my name is known. So are my associates. No, Mart, we&#8217;re talking about a mainstream movie, the full romantic Hollywood treatment. Sure, it will be spicy, probably rated &#8216;18&#8217;. But not pornography. No way.�
His heart missed a beat. �So, you mean like a proper grown up film.�
The American laughed nicely. �Yep. A proper grown-up, box-office-record-breaking, Oscar-winning, honest to goodness epic !�
�You&#8217;re serious ?�
�Serious as I&#8217;m standing here looking over at the Hollywood sign, Mart.�
�And ?�
�And we think that you and that lovely wife of yours should climb aboard a plane, First Class British Air, at our expense, and come on out to spend a week with your lovely daughter Chantal. I assume she&#8217;s real. And while you&#8217;re over here, we&#8217;d like you to take some time to visit with us and maybe talk about how we can put that story of yours into production.�

The suite at Shutters was smallish, but perfect. The boulevard, beach and Pacific Ocean were on the doorstep. Chantal and Greg&#8217;s tiny apartment was only a 30 minutes drive away, pretty close by Los Angeles standards.
For their first night they ordered room service.
�I&#8217;ll get it.� Mart called out, as the bell sounded.
The waiter was standard issue California-dude, presumably some student working his Summer job to make some cash. He flashed them his perfect smile, laying out the tray on the table.
Kelly was lying on the bed in her hotel robe.
She felt the boy&#8217;s blue eyes checking her out, taking in her legs, neck and face. She met his gaze full on, enjoying his sudden blink of embarrassment.
�Sign here, please Sir.� He said to Mart.
She watched Mart initial the check, wondering if the boy used lemon juice in his hair, how many hours he worked out at the gym daily.
�Shall I open the champagne Sir ?�
�I&#8217;ll do it, thanks.� Mart replied.
She chuckled as soon as the door was closed.
�You wanted to fuck him.� Mart said, twisting the cork until it popped.
�Just looking.� She replied good-naturedly. She had done over two months now. Like an addict in rehab, there had been moments of cold turkey.
�Here.� He said, passing her a glass.
They chinked them together.
�You � want to ?�
She sighed. �No, Mart. You know I don&#8217;t.�
It was like being married to a pusher.
He pushed the robe off her shoulder and kissed her neck. �Anything I can do ?�
Sex wasn&#8217;t bad. It was better than she&#8217;d feared. Better than it used to be before this all began. But there was no point lying to herself. Or to Mart. Once you have gorged on forbidden fruit salad, then an apple is an apple, is an apple.
�Let&#8217;s eat.� She said, pulling her robe back over her shoulder.

She&#8217;d imagined a short, fat, bald man, in a suit, smoking a big cigar.
In fact, &#8216;V&#8217; was tall, slim, greying, handsome and super-fit, wearing an open necked shirt.
He didn&#8217;t even have a cigar.
He kissed her hand and it felt right, not slimy at all.
But what she liked even more was that he gave her husband a firm handshake and treated him with proper manly respect.
�Take a seat.�
The view was breathtaking, except for the smoggy haze. They admired it, made small talk about the flight, broke the ice a while.
�So, I guess my email kinda came as a bit of a shock ?�
�It did.� Mart replied.
Kelly smiled, keeping her powder dry.
�Well, as you can tell, we&#8217;re serious. We really want to make this film.�
Mart breathed in. �Where do we go from here ?�
�Well, we have to reach agreement on an option. That&#8217;s a sum of money we pay you to buy the right to make the film under certain terms.�
�Okay.�
�Then we do all the usual stuff. Find the stars, the cast, write a script, choose locations, set a budget, obtain the money, you know !�
�Stars ?�
&#8216;V&#8217; beamed at them. �Stars. To play the main parts. And believe it or not, I have them lined up already. You see, they&#8217;re associates of mine. I thought immediately of them when I was reading your story.�
�Who ?�
When he said the names, she gasped.
�Fuck.� Mart said, letting out a whistle.
�But you have to keep that quiet until things are tied up.� He grinned at the &#8216;tying up&#8217; innuendo. �So to speak.�
�Sure.�
There was a pause.
�There&#8217;s just one small problem.�
�The money, I guess ?� Mart replied.
He waved his hands dismissively at Mart, then Kelly, as if money was irrelevant.
�No. The ending.�
�The ending ?�
�Yep. You see I&#8217;m afraid that we think it would make a much better story if it had a different ending.�

The house in Malibu was set right on the sandy beach.
Kelly sat on the sand and felt like a scraggly duckling alongside the swan-like poise of one of the most beautiful women in the world. Even dressed in cut off jeans and a white T, the famous actress looked like a billion dollars.
�I&#8217;m really going to need your help.�
MY help. Oh right. Kelly smiled. �Anything, if I can.�
�The most difficult part for me is going to be getting inside your head. I&#8217;ve played all sorts of roles before, but this will be my greatest challenge. I could never sleep around on my husband. I need to understand how anybody could.�
Kelly snorted slightly protectively. �It&#8217;s not that unusual.�
�No. I guess. Tell me what it&#8217;s like.�
�To me, it&#8217;s the opposite of that line attributed to Paul Newman about his wife Joanne Woodward. He apparently said, why go out for a burger, when he could have steak at home ?�
Kelly paused to make full contact with the warm, chestnut eyes.
�But � some of us � we don&#8217;t want steak every night. Or caviar, lobster, whatever gourmet dish you like. I like the fun of just going out for a good time, a couple of beers and a &#8216;burger&#8217;. With relish.�
The face stared towards her; behind the gorgeous features, the lightly tanned and faultless skin, the luscious lips, perfect hair, she was just another female, battling with a woman&#8217;s conflicting thoughts.
�I saw what those people wrote about you.� The actress said, casting a pebble towards the sea. �You came out pretty badly.�
�Like a pretty woman, huh ?� Kelly replied.
The actress smiled ruefully. �Several emails called you a whore.�
Kelly shrugged. �Men can&#8217;t make up their minds. We behave like women and they label us boring soccer moms. We behave like men, they call us whores.�
�Your husband Mart, he&#8217;s cute.�
�Uh-huh.� Kelly nodded in agreement. �And ?� Her voice rose. �I was faithful to him for two decades. I love him to this day. He would have been the only man I ever had sex with, were it not for � those five words. I didn&#8217;t go with other guys because Mart&#8217;s not cute. I did it because he said I could. Because he said I should. It seems a load of men want it. But the few wives and girlfriends who will actually do it are then criticised for doing so. That is your challenge. Don&#8217;t portray me as the villain in this, I&#8217;m not.�
�So is Mart the villain ?�
�You know what, this isn&#8217;t a neat script, where the characters are goodies and baddies. This actually happened and the people are real flesh and blood, warts and all.�
She was getting angry now. She understood the actress was just probing, doing her research. But �
She stood up and brushed the sand from her legs.
�I&#8217;ll just go and see how Mart&#8217;s doing.�

They had lunch with Chantal and Greg the following day.
�It&#8217;s so good to have you guys here.� Chantal enthused. �You look fabulous mom. And dad, you look so happy. But still so fit !�
They spent a wonderful two hours at The Ivy, enjoying hearing about Chantal&#8217;s job, Greg&#8217;s career, and talking about the house in Portugal, American and British politics, the usual newsworthy topics.
Over coffee, the name of a famous American actress came up in conversation. Chantal became very animated.
�Mom, she is so stunning. We saw her the other day on Rodeo Drive, climbing into a stretch. You can&#8217;t imagine how gorgeous she is close up.�
Kelly smiled. �Actually my dear, I think I probably can.�

September

EXTERIOR. CHURCH. &#8211; DAY

A typical English village church. It is a bright, typical September day. Various shots of the exterior during a service; long shot, view of car park, close up of entrance doors. We hear vague strains of the service through doors.

INTERIOR. CHURCH. AISLE. &#8211; DAY

Organ music. Widor&#8217;s &#8216;Toccata&#8217; plays. Dylan and Kelly recede up the aisle at the end of their wedding service, both dressed traditionally. The church is full of smiling faces, some we recognise, others we don&#8217;t. We see Alain, Jack, Naomi, other friends, even Ingrid. We do not see James, Nick or Chantal. Finally, we see Mart. He is standing in the Best Man&#8217;s spot.

EXTERIOR. CHURCH. &#8211; DAY

Congregation spilling out of church. Bride and groom&#8217;s car driving away.

INTERIOR. MOVING CAR. &#8211; DAY

DYLAN
Phewsh ! I&#8217;m glad that part&#8217;s over.

He GRABS Kelly sitting next to him on the back seat and kisses her.

KELLY
(laughing)
Careful, you impatient man !

She straightens her dress and hair/veil.
We see chauffeur&#8217;s eyes revealed in driver mirror. It is Mart.

DYLAN
The reception doesn&#8217;t start for twenty minutes.

Exaggerated look at watch.


INTERIOR. HOTEL BEDROOM. DOUBLE BED. &#8211; DAY

SUDDEN CUT. Straight to frantic sex scene in hotel bed. Loud GRUNTS and MOANS. Headboard of double bed THUDS wall rhythmically. Dylan is on top of Kelly, both nearing orgasms. Both are still clothed but for their lowered trousers/pants and rucked up wedding dress. Through the window we see wedding guests outside arriving for reception. Dylan and Kelly reach mutual climax. Mart is seen helping to guide guests into the hotel.

INTERIOR. HOTEL. RECEPTION. &#8211; DAY

Receiving Line. Dylan and Kelly are now nonchalantly greeting guests. We see Alain, Jack and Ingrid all kissing Kelly. Finally we see Naomi. She is unaccompanied. 

NAOMI
(in Kelly&#8217;s ear)
I&#8217;m sooo happy for you. Jealous � but happy.

KELLY
You feeling okay ?

Camera angle reveals that Naomi is pregnant.
Naomi and Kelly glance over at Jack. He is talking to a young, pretty female.

NAOMI
Didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d end up a single mum, did we ?

Kelly takes a breath and starts to speak, as if to apologise. Naomi gives her a rueful smile and places a finger over Kelly&#8217;s lips.

NAOMI (cont)
No speeches, my love. Save them for another time.

INTERIOR. HOTEL. RECEPTION. DAY &#8211; LATER

Speeches. Dylan is speaking. Audience are stood around LAUGHING, holding champagne glasses, listening. Kelly is stood beside Dylan.

DYLAN

� and so everybody, I&#8217;d like to end by thanking you all for coming today. And thanks for the presents as well. I&#8217;m sure my � wife (CHEERS from audience) will be writing to thank you for them, after we return from our � honeymoon (raucous JEERS). Now, pray silence please, for our dear friend Mart, the Best Man ! (loud cheers, jeers and APPLAUSE).

MART
Ladies, gentlemen, bride and groom, obviously this is a strange and � difficult moment for me.

As he speaks, the camera recedes from a close up of Mart&#8217;s face filling the screen, to a medium shot, to a long shot, then starts to fade out.

MART (cont)
Most of you already know how Kelly, Dylan and I got ourselves into this � situation. And now I guess you all want me to tell you how it will end.

FADE OUT

EXTERIOR. TROPICAL BEACH. DESERTED &#8211; DAY

FADE IN. We quickly gather it is a honeymoon scene. Kelly and Dylan are splashing in the sea. Their large towels lie side by side on the empty white sand. The idyllic boutique hotel on an island comprises individual thatched bungalows with their own plunge pools and private beach coves. There is nobody else in sight. We watch Kelly and Dylan during Mart&#8217;s voice over.

MART
(voice over)
This is not the end, of course. There is no end. For me anyway. One day it will all be over, one way or another, but that will be years, probably decades away. Until then �

INTERIOR. HOTEL ROOM. &#8211; DAY

Cut to Mart. He is standing, spread eagled. His arms are stretched up to cuffs round his wrists suspended from the thick wooden beam supporting the bungalow roof. The ceiling fan is switched off despite the stifling air. His feet are stretched apart by a spreader bar. Behind him, through the open doors, we can see the beach, and Kelly and Dylan embracing in the sea.

MART (cont, talking to camera)
� our lives will continue as the fates ordained. I always wanted a happy ending. Now I&#8217;ve learned the hard way that some poems don&#8217;t rhyme, and some stories don&#8217;t have a clear beginning, middle and end. Life is about &#8216;not knowing&#8217;; about having to change course, taking each moment and making the best of it.

He winces as a mosquito bites him. He is naked but for a steel chastity device round his penis. His skin is pale, shining with sweat. The camera pans around him telling its own story while he speaks; insect bites, bruised and scarlet buttocks, shaved body, nipple rings, finally a tattoo of a heart with the legend &#8216;Kelly and Dylan&#8217; engraved within it.

MART (cont)
It&#8217;s about not knowing what&#8217;s going to happen next. Delicious ambiguity. So, don&#8217;t feel sorry for me. This is what I wanted, what I asked for. I am lucky that Kelly and Dylan are prepared to have me along for the ride.

INTERIOR. HOTEL ROOM. &#8211; LATER

SUDDEN CUT. Close up from Mart&#8217;s p.o.v. at the word �ride�. Dylan is riding Kelly from behind in the doggy position, his bouncing balls and her sloshing pussy are in Mart&#8217;s face, inches from the screen. We HEAR the juicy noises and them enjoying it enthusiastically during Mart&#8217;s continued voice over.

MART
(voice over)
(his voice is muffled and affected by them bouncing in his face)
You know my story now. Can you honestly say that this is not what I deserve ? And can you honestly say that this is not what Kelly deserves (we hear her squeal in pleasure) ?

INTERIOR. HOTEL BATHROOM &#8211; LATER

Cut to Kelly sat on the toilet. At first we see just her naked breasts and torso. Gradually the camera pans downwards (this scene is as explicit as the censors will allow). Her knees are splayed. Mart is kneeling at her feet, his face between her thighs. The angle shifts to reveal Dylan stood at the double basin. He is bronzed and naked but for a white towel round his waist. There is soap on his face and he&#8217;s shaving, looking in the mirror.

MART
(voice over continued)
I am treated like shit and it may not be what I deserve in the strict sense of justice. But it is my destiny. Is it really so sad ? There are much sadder things than a man kneeling at his wife&#8217;s toilet. War, cancer, mental illness, starving children. Those things are truly sad.

INTERIOR/EXTERIOR. RAPID SCENES. DAY/NIGHT

The cuts accelerate, almost to a montage: we see Mart bent over at the waist being caned; we see him on the floor eating scraps from a bowl; we glimpse him kneeling, face upturned, as Dylan apparently pisses into his mouth; we see him lying on the floor burying his tongue into Kelly&#8217;s bottom.

MART
(voice over continued)
I am grateful to you all for caring about me. I am flattered my words moved you. But I do not want you to be sad. I lived my life as I wanted to. Could I have lived it differently ? Only, I think, by never starting down this road. If I had never made the offer to Kelly, then yes, I suspect we would still be a normal husband and wife to this day. But there would have been no story either, no five words.

Now we realise the flickering images are of the future, after the honeymoon. We glimpse scenes from England and Portugal and elsewhere. The characters start to age, the years pass. We see Mart polishing a gleaming red Ferrari. We see him doing household chores, washing, cooking, cleaning, ironing, scrubbing toilets, dressed as a maid and in other female clothes. We see him serving trays of drinks and canap�s at parties attended by Dylan and Kelly&#8217;s friends who have also gotten older. Finally, we see Kelly at a birth, kissing a baby, with Chantal in a hospital bed, Greg and Dylan smiling in the background. Mart is nowhere to be seen. The final shot is of Kelly, now in her seventies, maybe even eighties. She is still pretty, with a lined face and wisps of greying hair poking out from under her headscarf, cutting red roses in a garden. Slowly the camera recedes to reveal her alone, contrasted against a pink sunset.

FINAL FADE OUT
THE END






Epilogue
October 2007



Nick picked up his orange juice and went to table 12.
At the same time, a woman walked towards the seat opposite his. She was skinny, bespectacled, trying too hard. She might as well have had the double-D sign stencilled on her forehead; &#8216;divorced and desperate&#8217;.
He put on a brave smile and stuck out his hand.
�Hi. I&#8217;m Nick.�
�Hi.� Her eyes dropped to the floor nervously.
Speed dating. He sat down and prepared to spend another 5 minutes with another woman who wasn&#8217;t Naomi and never would be.
While she rambled on about her bijou flat, Burmese cat and part-time job in Sotheby&#8217;s Art department, he thought of his empty fridge at home, his empty weekend coming up, and the empty box of tissues by his computer.
�Nice meeting you.� He said, as their five minutes session ended.

The Clerk to the Court read out the charge sheet.
James stood silent in the dock as the three counts of tax evasion, two counts of accounting fraud and one of theft were announced to the Judge, Barristers, the Jury, and the small gallery behind him.
He sat impassive but his guts were churning. His legal team had told him that he was facing ruin and a likely prison term.
Plan A hadn&#8217;t worked.
There hadn&#8217;t really been much of a Plan B.
A vision of that rich married woman, what&#8217;s-her-name, flitted across his mind momentarily. Nice tits, shame she had a brain. He imagined her glancing through the newspapers in a few days time and reading of his conviction.
Somebody was looking at him over half-moon spectacles.
�How do you plead Mr. Pettigrew ?�

Kelly tapped the page with her finger and smiled at Mart.
�There&#8217;s not enough sex in this final chapter.�
He shrugged at her. �But that&#8217;s the reality.�
�Exactly. And that&#8217;s the sad part.�
She watched the wheels turning in his brain. His green eyes glinted.
It was now over four months. In that time, their sex life had faded from happy vanilla, during the &#8216;second honeymoon&#8217; weeks after Portugal, to the typical &#8216;once or twice a week&#8217; of a couple with 21 years of marriage behind them. They still lived by a few unspoken rules; Kelly&#8217;s pleasure came first, Mart gave her oral but she never took him in her mouth. He had given her his word that he would never masturbate but he wore no device to guarantee his chastity. He massaged and used vibrators on her whenever she asked. Many wives would consider her lifestyle ideal. No demands on her, sex when she wanted it, on her terms, and a faithful husband.
And yet.
�What � do you want ?� he croaked.
�Is this it, darling ? Is this what you want ?�
He exhaled. �You cured me. Dylan cured me. I don&#8217;t ever want that again.�
She ran her fingernail along his lower lip.
�Have you jacked off, Mart ? These past few months ? Once ? Twice ?�
He blushed. He looked down at the pages she was holding.
�Sometimes.�
�You can&#8217;t control yourself without help, can you ?�
He shook his head, looking up into her eyes.
�Did you enjoy it ? Masturbating in the bathroom or wherever.�
He shook his head again.
�Felt guilty ?�
He nodded this time, his expression like a scolded schoolboy.
�Shall we put you back in your Gerecke ?� she asked, breathless with tension.
�� yes.� He whispered.
�And get you doing all the chores again ? Shall I take control ?�
He looked at her, tears in his eyes.
�Please. Yes.�
She smiled.
�And, think long and hard about this one Mart � Any limits ?�

The bank transfer arrived with the requisite amount of dollars.
�Hi.� V&#8217;s voice said down the phone. �You get the money ?�
�We did.� Mart replied.
�And what do you think of the latest draft of the script ?�
�We still don&#8217;t like your ending but � what the heck. For the money, you can have whatever ending you like in your movie. But ours will be the truth.�
A chuckle came down the line. �Maybe you should write a sequel, Mart ? In a year or so. That&#8217;s what we do in Hollywood. Sequels. Trilogies even. Yep, I&#8217;m looking forward to reading Five More Words. Then we&#8217;ll know what really happened.�
Mart looked at the clock. He was behind schedule. Kelly had left him with a strict list of chores to be done to a timetable.
�Gotta dash. Thanks for the call.�
�Bye Mart. Keep in touch.�

Kelly arrived home with a venomous gleam in her eyes. She pulled on a pair of white cotton gloves and began walking round the house, checking every ledge and corner for specks of dust.
She found five tiny marks during a full 20 minutes tour of the house.
�That will be fifteen strokes.�
He groaned; one plus two plus three plus four plus five accumulated to fifteen.
�I&#8217;ll give them to you when Nao comes round tomorrow for lunch.� She threw herself down in an armchair, shopping bags around her. �Bring me a cup of tea and a chocolate biscuit, I&#8217;ve had nothing since an omelette and coffee at breakfast.�
He made tea and returned to find her sorting through her purchases.
�Massage my feet.�
He pulled off her boots, one by one, and then her socks. Her feet were damp and squashed by the leather. Her gently kneaded them into shape.
She lay back in the chair, munching her biscuit, relaxing. �Kiss them.�
He brought her toes up to his lips and sucked each one in turn. She was wearing tight jeans, a shirt and a taut sweater that accentuated her cleavage.
�Undress me.�
He helped lift her and pulled off her jeans and underwear. She was damp, excited. There was a distinctive, heady scent of femininity. He moved to pull off her sweater.
�No. That&#8217;s enough.� She said, quietly. �Massage my legs.�
He knelt beside her and started rubbing her feet again, ankles, calves, knees. Her legs were out straight and she sighed in happiness.
�I bought you a present, Mart. Stick it on.�
She handed him a CD. He walked to the system and put it in the drive, bringing the remote back to her. He watched her press play.

I've paid my dues
time after time.

The unmistakeable sound of Freddy Mercury&#8217;s voice filled the room.

I've done my sentence 
but committed no crime.
And bad mistakes 
I've made a few.
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
but I've come through.

She was smirking at him while he continued massaging her legs.
The previous September she had given away his CD collection and replaced them with the jazz and contemporary female stuff she liked.
He gave in, and laughed, smiling back. The words were highly suitable.

We are the champions, my friends 
and we'll keep on fighting, till the end.
We are the champions
we are the champions, 
no time for losers 
'cause we are the champions of the world.

Her legs were open now, thighs parted. He ran his fingertips lightly up between them.
�Here.� She gestured for him to squat between her legs until his face was an inch from her mound. Her wet pubic hair was trimmed into a thin brazilian stripe alongside her labia and atop her mound. She liked some hair to contrast with his own shaved genitals.
�Tongue my butt.�
Her hips edged forward so that her bottom slid off the edge of the chair.
He used his fingers to gently pry her anus open, snaking his tongue into her. She smelt musky, salty and tasted coppery.
�Yessss �� she hissed, her knees twitching. �Ummm � I love you Mart. Just remember that, whatever happens. Nobody can lick my asshole like you can !� she let out a small fit of giggles.
His soul somersaulted at her words of love and humiliation.
�Open my pussy now.�
He manoeuvred his thumbs and slowly separated her oozing, gummy labia.
�Make me cum, darling. Hurry !�
He slurped his tongue upwards. She was overflowing. He lapped her ripe, pink petals, sucking up her excitement. Her clitoris was hard and urgent against his nose.
And he wondered. Yes, she might have. She was certainly soaking enough. She&#8217;d been out all day without a word of explanation. Those were the rules again. There was a tang of soap and eau de toilette and the syrupy flow was more copious than she&#8217;d ever produced on her own before. And yet, there were no obvious streaks of creamy semen, the like of which he&#8217;d seen and tasted many times. Maybe she had washed herself to keep him guessing ? Or she might not have had sex with anybody at all and it was just raw excitement. Maybe that&#8217;s how it would be from now ? Not knowing. Unsure. Just accepting her as She was, however She was. Forever.
�Aaahhhsss ��
She mashed his face, not waiting for him to bring her off, but seizing her climax from him instead. His wife. His magnificent, lustful wild animal.
The beast he had created.
A life in five words.
For better or for worse.
In sickness and in health.
Till death do us part.


Let&#8217;s let &#8216;Kelly&#8217; have the last word, she thought to herself, leaning over to kiss him. They were side by side in bed together, her on the left and him on the right.
She teased her hand down his ribs, his thigh, to cup his Gerecke. He had put on a few pounds since June but, a few more weeks of exercise and diet, and he&#8217;d be back to the �25 year old&#8217;s body� she preferred him with.
The last word ? It was only fitting that she should have the final say, figuratively and literally. It had been a long journey, too often viewed through the distorting prism of his words. She had let &#8216;Mart&#8217; tell it in his own way, even though he had got some things wrong.
But he had been right about one thing in particular. She really had learned a lot along the road. She cringed sometimes, thinking about a few of the mistakes she&#8217;d made. Now she knew what she believed in. She really did believe that a Female-led marriage could be a happy and lasting one. She really did believe that &#8216;Mart&#8217; would be better off having his routine, diet, exercise and, yes, orgasms strictly controlled. To some people it would be just a kinky game. But she knew it worked best as a whole way of life. Maybe the past twelve months could act as some kind of manifesto ?
But enough of that for tonight. She was tired.
�Did Chantal have any other news ?� she asked, removing her teasing hand from him for the night, to suppress a yawn.
�No.� he shook his head distractedly. �We only talked about the fires.�
They had phoned &#8216;Chantal&#8217; and &#8216;Greg&#8217; several times to check they were okay. More than a million people had been evacuated from their Southern California homes due to terrible bushfires. Fortunately the winds had lessened and in the past few days the situation had improved.

Samantha nodded, reaching up to switch off the lights.
�Goodnight Joe.� She whispered. �Have you set your alarm ?�
�Yes. What time do you want me to bring you coffee ?�
�Not until ten thirty. I need a lie in.�
Joe would have four hours after waking at dawn to carry out a whole list of chores. Now that he had finished writing their story, he&#8217;d have time to do everything else for her again.
Sure, Five Words had been life changing for both of them but the events had happened pretty much as he&#8217;d written. And they were still happening, tonight, tomorrow, somewhere, at this very moment.
�Goodnight � Sam. I love you.� He murmured her real name.
&#8216;And I love you too&#8217;. She mouthed back, silently in the dark.
Then Samantha smiled to herself. He was lying there distracted, puzzling, and she knew why. He was wondering about what she had got up to today. Or hadn&#8217;t got up to. She suspected he thought he knew the answer.
Happily, he&#8217;d be wrong.
And Samantha also imagined those readers out there who had followed their story. Her &#8216;Kelly Diary&#8217; as she liked to think of it. All of them puzzling, wondering � well, had She ? Or hadn&#8217;t She ?
Egg white ! It was a little trick she&#8217;d read about. She had cracked a couple of eggs that morning. She&#8217;d used the yolks to rustle up a quick omelette for her breakfast. But the whites went in a plastic container with a pinch of salt and, before arriving home, she&#8217;d used a cake-decorating syringe to inject the glutinous, saline fluid deep inside her. Then a wipe with a soapy cloth and a spray of Chanel and the trap was set for her return.
�Joe ?� she whispered.
�Yes.�
�Do you know which five words should really finish our story ?�
There was a long silence.
�Tell me.�
� � they lived happily ever after.�
