The Baron of Lugonia

Chapter 1

Baron Montfort Grackle had perhaps the finest estate in all of the island nation of Lugonia. His mansion stood well-secluded from� the main� road between the port of� St. Lucia and the capital city of� Arnaz. If one approached the house by the long winding driveway, nothing out of the ordinary was apparent at first, but upon� knocking on the heavy oaken doors at the front of the main house, a visitor would immediately be struck by the nature of the Baron'd iron-handed control of his manse.

As the door is opened to admit the visitor ( assuming one has legitimate reason to call on the reclusive estate-holder), he or she are met by a tall brunette woman, dressed� in modified butler's garb. But the androgenous clothing has been cut away at the breast, the underlying linen shirt only buttoning closed below the woman's� bosom, with the full glory of her 39-DD� orbs exposed to the guest.� This is but the first sign that the Baron populates his home with women who are� indentured into a life of service and servitude.

"Will you please follow me," instructs the servant, as she leads� the visitor into the Great Hall of the mansion. As the butler guide turns away, the visitor is shown the� smooth buttocks of the retreating figure, the trousers also having been tailored in such a way that they� have two moon shaped opening in the seat , revealing the whole of the ass. Only a� narrow� strip of cloth through the crotch and up to the waist, separating the two cheeks, hiding the sex between her legs, and serves to titilate the viewer due to the immodesty of the ensemble.

Intrigued, the guest is led into a high-ceilinged side room off the main corridor, passing through heavy wooden doors that slide manually sideways into the walls. The doors are at least� four inches thick, but roll aside on well-oiled� tracks. A heavy keyhole occupies one door - obviously the room can be secured. The room has a stone floor but is heavily carpeted in the middle, with several settees and chairs. 

Entering the room, the visitor realizes that it is a sort of trophy room. But mounted on the walls are not the heads of giant beasts, but a series of portions of the female form.� On one wall are a series of plaques, each sporting a pair of breasts of varying sizes and shapes. Some are large and pendulous while others are petite and pert.

On the other side of the room, flanking a great stone fireplace, stand two figures like statuary.� But they are not mere hollow suits of armour - no, they are quickly revealed to be women, standing naked, rigid.

"Please wait here," instructs the butler woman. "I shall alert the Master that he has a visitor," she says as she departs the wood-panelled room.

Curious, the visitor moves towards the hearth to gain a closer look at the two statuesque female adornments.� They are both alive, but stand absolutely still, oblivious to the presence of the guest. The one to the left of the fireplace is strawberry blonde, with a rounded compact bosom with breasts about the size of a half cantalope.� The hair is straight and cropped above the shoulder in a style that frames the unseeing face. The pubic hair, slightly darker, is curly and trimmed to a small triangular patch ending just above the cunt. The figure to the right has red hair about the shade of copper, and it is drawn up into a knot on top of the head while the equally copper-coloured pubic patch is trimmed the same as the blonde's. Her breasts are slightly smaller with the nipples, perky and erect, capping her trim bosom. Both figures stand motionless, with arms at their sides in a passive attention stance.

Only upon moving closer can the visitor see that each is mounted on a metal post fixed in the masonry of the stone floor, the three-inch shaft penetrating the anus. Touching the breast of the redhead, the visitor is surprised at the suppleness of the skin.� These are living statues, not just exteriors over a rigid form. Curious, the visitor pinches the redhead's nipples, but gets no reaction, no vocal response. "What is this?" wonders the guest.

"Ah, I see you are admiring my trophies," says a baritone voice from behind. Turning, the guest sees the figure of the Baron, tall, at least six feet, with dark Mediterranean skin, and a full beard and moustache. He is dressed as befits a man of wealth and power, but also one who is quite as ease in his own skin.� For the Baron is not just a land-owner in this land, he is also a scientist who has devoted his life to understanding human physiology and the workings of the mind.

"They are quite alive," explains the Baron, "but in a state of suspended animation.� I enjoy looking upon them as a reminder of the successful discoveries I have made in the function of the human organism."

"But how do they come to be here?" asks the curious guest.

"Ah, that is quite simple,"� explains the swarthy man. "As one of the richest citizens of this country, my position is respected and my motives are not questioned.� You see, my extensive holdings of land and businesses comprise a great portion of this nation's tax base, and my own particular notions of how I run my affairs are not open for scrutiny."

"But, how come these women to be here?", ventures the visitor again.

"It is quite simple," states the Baron. "Positions in my household are highly prized by the citizens of my country.� I am particularly generous to the families� who send their daughters to become part of my house staff, and they sign a lifetime contract with me that precludes any further questions about the status of their family member or contact with me or the girls after they come here."

"But don't any of them ever become curious about the process?, asks the visitor.

"As I said," states the Baron, "my generosity means that the family who enlists their daughter in my estate never has to worry about their finances again.� I also have the influence in Lugonia's treasury and revenue department to relieve them of taxation for the rest of their lives.� So they are disinclined to pressure me for unpleasant details, and I am free to conduct my studies."

"But what of those breasts, mounted on the wall?" asks the visitor, much intrigued.

"They are various examples of my methods," says the reclusive scientist.� Some of them have actually been severed from the bodies of my test subjects, while others are also living tissue, still attached to the specimen. You see, some of the women I take into this estate become house servants, some are utilized in my research, and some serve in both capacities."

"The wall is hollow behind the mounted tits, with an accessway to certain of the women who have been presented on the wall, whole, with only their breasts protruding into this room. They, too, are in a stasis, behind that partition. Later, I will show you."

Just then, another servant enters the room.� "Your afternoon tea is served," says she.� Turning, the guest sees the woman is dressed in an obscene imitation of a maid's outfit, with only enough cloth to suggest the usual styling.� The black and white garment is cut low, so that it undercuts the breasts, and way even uplift them slightly. The skirt and apron, such as they are, end at the waist, with a ruffle of petticoats lifting the three or so inches of black skirt and white apron away from her rounded belly, her sex completely exposed below, all hair shaven away. White lace stockings cling to her legs held in place by an elastic top. She wears black pumps with low heels. The whole effect is quite lewd, as her outfit suggests servitude and grants her no sense of modesty. But she seems not to notice in any way that the visitor is exhibited all her assets.

"Won't you join me for tea?" inquires the Baron.

To be continued.









The Baron of Lugonia

Chapter 2

Following the Baron and the maid back into the Great Hall, the visitor is led into the rear of the expansive mansion to a sun-lit parlor with a linen covered table and eight chairs, the one at the head of the table with a high back and wooden arms.� A silver tea service is laid out upon the table and the guest is bade to take a seat while the semi-clad maid pours the steaming water into the cup over the teabag, English-style. Obviously a tradition dating to the Colonial period when the sun never set on the British Empire...

"Milk with your tea?" inquires the host. Why yes, the visitor prefers it this way.

Thereupon, the servant opens up the double doors on a sideboard, vertical in arrangement, to reveal the figure of a naked girl positioned inside. Startled, the guest realizes that she has large breasts, brunette hair tumbling over her shoulders, but no apparent arms or legs. No - she has none.

"This is Marguerite, one of my service girls," says the Baron, noting the startled expression on the visitor's face. "She provides a ready source of fresh milk, which I am quite fond of. She has been modified specifically to serve this purpose." 

"Milk for your tea?" says the limbless girl, and smiles. Apparently she is quite content in her role as a milkmaid - literally! The guest notices that she has been secured in place on a porcelain base with a support probe in her vagina ("I wonder how deeply it goes in?" wonders the guest) and that steel supports are inserted through the sides of the cabinetry from the outside into metal sockets implanted in the sides of her shoulders.

The Baron welcomes the visitor to serve� himself to however much milk he desires in his tea. "Just tickle the nipples, and then squeeze them.� The milk will come quickly as she is in constant lactation. I keep her on a low dose regimen of hormones so that she never runs dry," explains the host.

Marguerite smiles up from her subservient position and says encouragingly, "Do help yourself - don't be shy," noting the visitor's initial hesitance to milk her tits into his cup. Truth be told, the bosom is very inviting, being ample and slightly pendulous, with petite nipples on one and a half inch aeriolae, sienna in colour. She arches her back, lifting the breasts upward invitingly to the guest. Squeezing the left udder, the milk comes almost instantly, squirting neatly into the cup. "Is that all you want?" she asks.� "I have plenty." Her brown eyes gaze up, imploringly.

"I keep her handy for ease of service," explains the Baron, "but she is removed for cleansing and sunning to maintain the skin tone.� It would not do to let her become unclean, as a provider of consumables," he adds.

"Oh yes," says the torso-only girl, "the Baron treats me quite well, and I am pleased to be part of his household. And my milk is quite creamy. I do hope it suits you. As you can see, this is my primary duty to the kitchen."

"Remarkable," thinks the guest. "Obviously wealth DOES have its privileges..."
�
The maid returns from a side door with a plate of sweet biscuits, her naked breasts jiggling as she leans over to offer the guest his choice. "Biscuits or breasts?" he thinks, and takes a sweet, but also squeezes the bosoms she is presenting before his face. They are firm and inviting. The maid moans softly as her pebbled nipple is rolled between the thumb and forefinger of the visitor. The Baron has a hint of a smile as he watches. "She has quite a nice pair," he observes. "I enjoy seeing the beauty of a woman's bosom, exposed and not covered."

"After tea, I will show you some more of my estate," says the Baron, gently waving off the maid to the service pantry...
