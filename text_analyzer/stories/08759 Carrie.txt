Carrie

by 

Her friend said, �I heard on the radio that a major Hollywood studio is going to make a feature film near here.&nbsp; Wouldn&#8217;t it be neat if they are hiring extras?�&nbsp; Carrie thought about that, and then she went through the classified ads in the newspaper.&nbsp; She spotted one: Want to act in the movies?&nbsp; There was a local number to call, so she did.

�Yeah?� said a woman&#8217;s voice.

�I&#8217;m calling about the ad in the paper, about acting in the movies?�

�Ya wanna screen test?�

�Yes, please.�

�Lafayette Motel, room 34, any time this afternoon or tonight.&nbsp; Bring proof of your age.�

Carrie didn&#8217;t have a car, so she rode her bike, three miles.&nbsp; She arrived, her denim shorts and white T-shirt wet with sweat, and showed the woman her passport, which she had from her junior year abroad in high school.&nbsp; The woman gave her a dozen forms to sign, explaining that they were an application for a screen test and a release of any photos made during it.&nbsp; When Carrie finished, the woman made a phone call, and two men came into the motel room.

Carrie, I&#8217;m Sam, the producer/director.&nbsp; So, you want to be in the movies?�

�Yes.�

�Maybe be the star?�

�Wow, I wish!�

�You&#8217;re kinda tall.&nbsp; How tall are you?�

 �A little under six feet.�&nbsp; Being taller than most of the guys in high school had really cut down on dates.

�This is Joe, the head of photography.&nbsp; Wadda ya think, Joe?�

�I like her coloring, the red hair and fair skin, and those strange eyes.&nbsp; Nice bones, too.&nbsp; I say, give her a try.&nbsp; Carrie, strip down to your bra and panties.�

�I don&#8217;t understand!�

�Do it, girl,� said the woman.&nbsp; �They have to see what you&#8217;d look like in costume for the part, see you don&#8217;t have any tatoos or anything.&nbsp; An actress can&#8217;t be modest; all the big stars have stripped down for the camera: Halle Berry, Julia Roberts, Angelina Jolie.�

Carrie took off her T-shirt and shorts.&nbsp; Her low-waist panties were damp and hardly concealed the contours of her vulva.&nbsp; She tried hard not to show her embarrassment by holding her hands over her crotch.&nbsp; �Those tits real?� asked Sam.&nbsp; Without waiting for Carrie to answer, the woman reached from behind and pulled the bra up over Carrie&#8217;s breasts.&nbsp; �Shit, the bra was padded.&nbsp; They&#8217;re no bigger than cookies,� said Sam.

Carrie wanted to cry.&nbsp; �Sam,� said the woman,�Let her read some lines.&nbsp; Tits can be fixed.&nbsp; She does have the face, and that ingenue look.�&nbsp; Joe was setting up a tripod and video camera, taking pictures of Carrie as she stood there, practically naked and confused as to what was happening.&nbsp; Sam nodded, and the woman said, �Carrie, take off all your clothes.&nbsp; It&#8217;s all right.&nbsp; I&#8217;m here.&nbsp; You want the job, don&#8217;t you?�&nbsp; Carrie looked confused, but she reached behind her back and unhooked the bra, then shrugged it off over her arms.&nbsp; Sam and Joe looked on expectantly, as she slid her panties down and stepped out of them.&nbsp; The woman pointed at her shoes.&nbsp; Carrie sat on a sofa and untied her canvas shoes, took them and the wool athletic socks off.
Joe said, �Forget the reading.&nbsp; Sign her to a contract.�&nbsp; The woman handed Carrie a contract, which Carrie scanned, as she sat there naked, her knees pressed together.

�It says Splendid Productions, Inc.&nbsp; Who&#8217;s that?�

�That&#8217;s us,� said the woman.&nbsp; �The way the industry is now, the old studios are broken up.&nbsp; One company produces, another distributes&nbsp; &#8212; like that.�

�It says $25 an hour.&nbsp; How can I live on that?&nbsp; How many hours would I be working?&nbsp; I mean, it&#8217;s not gonna be five days a week, fifty weeks a year is it?�

�No,� said Sam, �but if you work an eight hour day, we&#8217;ll feed you and give you a place to sleep.�

�I can get that at home.&nbsp; I want $100 dollars an hour.�

Sam seemed to be thinking.&nbsp; �OK, $50 an hour.�

�OK.&nbsp; I sure could use a good job.�&nbsp; The woman inked in the amount and Carrie signed the contract, then Sam, while the woman made another phone call.

Sam looked at his watch.&nbsp; �You might as well start right now.&nbsp; Now, this is your big scene.&nbsp; You and your boy friend have been drugged, and...&nbsp; Well, just go along with the flow.&nbsp; Pretend you are unconscious.�&nbsp; Two men came in and picked up Carrie.&nbsp; They draped her across a low coffee table, on her belly, and tied her hands and knees to the legs of the table.&nbsp; Her breasts didn&#8217;t show, as they were pressed against the table top.&nbsp; Her knees were on the floor, spread wide apart.&nbsp; Joe held the camera in his hand and moved around, taping Carrie from every angle, especially from behind, zooming in on her virginal-looking vulva.&nbsp; One of the men pulled out a prop pistol and waved it in front of Carrie&#8217;s face, while the woman applied some surgical jelly to Carrie&#8217;s anus.
�Listen, cunt,� your goin&#8217; to cooperate or your boy friend gets it, first the knees, then the balls.�

Carrie lay, inert on the table.&nbsp; �Carrie,� said Sam, you can wake up now.&nbsp; Put some expression into it.&nbsp; Your boy friend is about to be castrated, if you don&#8217;t play along with these guys.�&nbsp; Carrie opened her eyes.

�You cooperate, or your boy friend gets a bullet in the balls.&nbsp; Now suck my cock.�

�No, you can&#8217;t make me do that!� said Carrie, quite convincingly, since she meant it.

�Yes, I can.�&nbsp; He pried her jaws apart with the barrel of his revolver and unzipped his fly.&nbsp; �You bite, and you&#8217;ll be sorry.�&nbsp; While Sam and the woman coached her, Carrie sucked cock for the first time in her life.&nbsp; It took a while before she got it right, and the guy shot semen over her face.&nbsp; Joe stopped filming for a moment, while the woman added more, some artificial semen that smelled like hair conditioner.&nbsp; Then there were close ups.

�I didn&#8217;t know acting would be like this.&nbsp; I think I want to quit, now,� said Carrie.

�You can&#8217;t.&nbsp; You signed a contract.�&nbsp; The second actor was forcing his hard tool against Carrie&#8217;s virginal anus.&nbsp; She protested with screams and groans, but the man buried his tool in her ass and pumped hard for Joe&#8217;s camera.&nbsp; Then he pulled out and splashed across Carrie&#8217;s back.&nbsp; Sam took a turn next, and stuffed his prod into her vagina.&nbsp; At least he used a condom.&nbsp; By the time Sam was done, there were three more guys waiting in line.&nbsp; The woman had slipped out and recruited men from the motel bar.&nbsp; After them, Carrie was beyond the screaming and groaning.&nbsp; She just lay there and got fucked.&nbsp; A particularly well hung gentleman took great pleasure in fucking Carrie, but he insisted on wearing a scarf across his face.&nbsp; Carrie didn&#8217;t even look at his face, but he seemed anxious not to be recognized.&nbsp; He had explained to the woman, when he first saw Carrie, that she had been his student in high school Civics a month ago.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sam didn&#8217;t mind the mask, as Joe concentrated on close-ups of the huge prick sliding in and out.&nbsp; For the first time, Carrie responded positively, oozing pussy juice and finally screaming as she came, for the first time.&nbsp; When her teacher had left, a couple of bikers came in and fucked her ass.&nbsp; One wanted her to lick him clean, afterward, but Carrie vomited at the prospect, and Sam told the guy he&#8217;d got his money&#8217;s worth.
Finally, for Joe&#8217;s close-ups, the woman played with Carrie&#8217;s clit until Carrie came again, and then the woman slid her hand into Carrie&#8217;s sodden twat.&nbsp; She pumped in and out and finally got it all in, made a fist, and pushed Carrie over the edge of a very noisy orgasm.

�Any more customers?� asked Sam.&nbsp; There seemed to be no one waiting.&nbsp; �OK, cut!�&nbsp; They untied Carrie and let her use the shower to wash off.&nbsp; She had a real hang-dog look, as if she&#8217;d been rode hard and put away wet, which was pretty much true.&nbsp; She came out of the bathroom and put on her T-shirt, shorts and shoes.&nbsp; It seemed one or more of the men figured they could take her underwear.&nbsp; They probably took motel towels, too.&nbsp; Carrie looked at Sam with a look of scorn.&nbsp; �Hey, Carrie, you did good,� he said.&nbsp; �You&#8217;ll be in a hundred peep shows and all over the Internet.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s see, an hour and twenty minutes.&nbsp; Hell, here&#8217;s a hundred.�&nbsp; He handed her five twenties.&nbsp; It seemed a pittance for her loss of innocence.

Carrie stuffed the money in her pocket and finished tying her shoes.&nbsp; �Call that number, if you&#8217;d like to act in another movie,� said Sam, as she let herself out and unlocked her bike.&nbsp; She threw her leg over the saddle and reacted to the pressure of the bicycle seat on her well used labia.&nbsp; As she rode home, missing her panties, the&nbsp; rough denim pressing against her clitoris distracted her.&nbsp; At last, she went behind a gas station and fingered herself until she came.&nbsp; Well, let&#8217;s hope I can make it home, now.&nbsp; If I don&#8217;t have to stop again, I&#8217;ll be home by supper time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
