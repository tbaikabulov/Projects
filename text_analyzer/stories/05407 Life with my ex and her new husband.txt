I
was married to Michelle for 5 years. I have to admit that our time together
was, for her, unpleasant. You see, to begin with, I am very un-endowed (is that
a real word?) with a penis that is about 2 inches when soft, and only about 4
inches when erect. I was, therefore, unable to provide her with adequate sexual
satisfaction. That does not mean that we never had sex. We actually had two
children together, but she got no enjoyment out of it. And yes, we did do oral
and we did use toys, but pleasure from real intercourse was also important to her, and in this department, I was unable to deliver.

Michelle
probably could have lived with this deficiency if I wasn't also into being so
submissive. I really liked it when she would make fun of me for my size and treat
me like her little boy instead of her husband. I wanted her to scold me and
spank me when I was naughty - even to put me into diapers as a punishment from
time to time. Being the caring wife she was, she tried to do all of this, but
she derived nothing from it and besides, she didn't like it either.

In
short, everything that turned me on was a turn-off for her. And so, I guess it
was inevitable that she would decide, after nearly&nbsp;six years, to divorce
me and find a real man. That was the start of my real problems.

The
divorce petition demanded that I not only pay generous child support (I would certainly
have paid, but she demanded much more than any court would have ordered) but
that I also give her a large alimony. The demands were, in my opinion, quite
unreasonable, and I would have fought them if she hadn't put into her petition
all of the sordid details about our sex life.&nbsp;Not only did her affidavit go
into excruciating detail about my sexual inadequacies, she also spared no
detail about my desire to be treated like a little boy. She revealed how she
would keep me hairless, how she would make me wear little boy clothes, and how
she would take me over her knee and spank me when I misbehaved. All this, she
argued, was at my insistence, and it was her primary reason for wanting out of
the marriage.

Needless
to say I was mortified. Not only did her lawyer know all about me now, so did
my own lawyer as would the judge who would have to read the petition and
authorize the divorce. The last thing I wanted was for us to have a trial which
would be public and during which I would have to submit to a very embarrassing
cross examination. And so, I agreed to all of her demands.

Within
six months, Michelle had found&nbsp;another man. John could not have been more
opposite than I. He is tall, 6' 3&quot; and well built. I assume that he is
also well endowed. He is also a take charge, no nonsense&nbsp;kind of guy, even
dominant. They married and she and our two children
moved in with him.

In
the meantime, I had great difficulty keeping up the financial end of our
divorce &quot;agreement&quot;, falling behind in my payments. The stress of the
divorce and everything else finally began to catch&nbsp;up with me and the
quality of my work suffered to the point that I was let go from my job at the
bank. Now I couldn't even make child support payments. I suppose that I could
have asked a judge to order a lower amount, but this seemed unfair to my kids
and would have necessitated hearings where all of the other issues were sure to
arise.

And
so, I decided to visit Michelle and John to discuss matters with them.

Our
meeting was a disaster. Don't get me wrong, they&nbsp;were both polite, but
they were also absolutely inflexible. No amount of pleading on my part made a
difference. They were determined to not change the terms of our divorce
agreement on iota and they made it clear that they would be taking me to court
to enforce them. I left their home devastated, not knowing where to turn.

And
then, out of the blue, Michelle called me the next day and said that she and
John had had a long talk about my predicament and were
prepared to offer me a way out. She told me to be at their house a 7 pm that
evening and they would outline their proposal. 

When
I arrived, John answered the door and told me to wait for him and Michelle in
the living room. I was a little surprised that he was instructing me rather
than inviting me, but let it pass. After about 10 minutes, the two entered and
sat opposite me on the couch.

Michelle
began the conversation by revealing that she and John had devised a plan that
would be beneficial to everyone if I agreed. She wanted to return to school to
finish her degree, she explained, but was unable to do so because it would mean
hiring a nanny/housekeeper - something that they could not afford to do right&nbsp;now.
If I agreed to take on that role, she and John would be prepared to let me live
in their home and would forego any further child support payments or alimony. I
would get room and board and a small stipend and the children would be able to see
me more regularly.

I
was dumbstruck. I had never considered such a situation and had to admit that
all things considered, it made a lot of sense and I told them so.

&quot;Not
so fast sonny boy,&quot; John interjected.

Sonny boy? I looked at John and then back to Michelle.

&quot;Yes,
well there is more to it than that,&quot; she said.

Michelle
then went on to explain that she had been completely open with John about the
reasons for our divorce. He had read all of the documents and the two had
spoken at great length about me and my proclivities.

To
say that I was instantly embarrassed would be a huge understatement. Of course,
I shouldn't have been surprised. Naturally they would have discussed all of
this before marrying. But to have it all out in the open like this, suddenly,
with no indication of what was coming, was quite something else. My mouth went
dry, my pulse quickened and I started to sense a butterfly feeling in the pit
of my stomach. Where was this going I asked myself?

I
didn't have to wait to find out.

It
was John's turn to talk. &quot;Steve, this arrangement we are discussing is not
a zero-sum gain for us. If you or your work is inadequate, we cannot simply
fire you because you will then have no job to pay Michelle what you owe her and
we will have no money to afford a replacement.&quot;

&quot;I
don't understand,&quot; I lied, knowing full well what was coming next.

&quot;So
rather than firing you when you slip up, we have decided that you will be
disciplined,&quot; John explained.

&quot;Disciplined??&quot;
I stammered.

&quot;Spanked,&quot;
Michelle cut in.&nbsp;

&quot;That's
right,&quot; said John. ï¿½In fact, this job should be a dream come true for you
because for it to work, you must agree to be treated just like the little boy
you have clearly always wanted to be. You will be expected to discharge all of
your duties like an adult, but you will be under our complete control like a
child.&quot;

For
a moment I was tongue tied. I didn't know what to say. Then, just like when
Michelle and I were married, my adrenaline and hormones began to get the better
of me. Like a moth attracted to a flame, I couldn't resist delving more and
more into the details of what they were proposing, all the while knowing that
the more I did, the more I would become ensnared.

&quot;What
do you mean when you say 'under your control like a child'?&quot; I asked.

&quot;It's
really quite simple,&quot; Michelle explained. &quot;We will decide what
clothes you wear, who your friends are, what you eat, what time you go to
bed... everything that parents decide for little children. And when you
disobey, you will be punished accordingly.&quot;

&quot;And
that means all the time, everywhere,&quot; said John. &quot;Don't worry; we
won't go out of our way to humiliate you. For example, no loving parent would
ever spank their children in the mall...&quot;

&quot;Except
maybe for a smack on the bottom,&quot; Michelle interjected.

&quot;Well,
yes, maybe a swat or two if deserved. But my point is that Steve, if he agrees
to this, will not need to worry that this will turn into a public humiliation
fest. That's not the point. The point is for him to accept our authority over
him at all times - even if that WERE to mean having his pants taken down in a
crowded mall.&quot;

I
gulped. &quot;What about the children?&quot; I asked.

&quot;You
mean would you be punished in front of the children? Not gratuitously,&quot;
said John. &quot;But we are not about to promise that it will never happen.
Besides, all of this is really in your hands, isn't it? If you do as your told,
and act as you should, you will never discover what we are prepared to subject
you to in terms of discipline, will you?&quot;

He
had a point. All the same, something was telling me to run away from this deal
as fast as possible. But how could I? It real was the perfect arrangement. I
got a job, Michelle would be able to go back to school, and I would no longer
have to pay support or alimony&nbsp;and would have a roof over my head to boot.
And so what if I had to endure a little teasing and play from time to time at
the hands of Michelle and her new husband. To be sure, it was embarrassing to
be in this position, but it was what I liked.

I
agreed.

&quot;OK.
We are going to write a contract that each of us will sign,&quot; said John.
&quot;Be here Saturday morning at 9 am and we'll finalize everything.&quot;

I
stood up and thanked them both for their time, saying that I hoped this would
all work out. I then left to go home and start making plans for my new life.

End of part one.
