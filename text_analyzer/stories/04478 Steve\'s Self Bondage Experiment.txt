An Experiment in Self
Bondage

&nbsp;

This is a story about my experiences in exploring
self-bondage.� I am normally a dominant
male who enjoys placing submissive women in restrictive bondage for prolonged
periods.� I had always wondered what it
felt like to bound and helpless, so I began exploring self-bondage.� As you know, the trick with self-bondage is
to make the release reliable and foolproof, although I would prefer to give
control of my release to someone I trust.

I thought about the ways I could do this and, of course, the
key in an ice block is a tried and true method.�
I wanted it to be difficult to get the key and to have to wait a long
time to get it.� I placed the keys to my
many padlocks in a small toolbox, locked this with a chain around it and through
the handle.� I have quite a lot of
bondage equipment to experiment with and time as well.� This adventure took about two months of trial
and error before I was able to go through with the complete procedure.

My bedroom is located at the end of a long (25 ft.) hallway with two bedroom doors on one
side and a closet, bathroom and laundry room doors on the other side.� I decided to make getting from my bedroom to
the freezer a little more difficult by putting thumbtacks on the carpet in the
hallway.� So I started by tossing the
tacks on the carpet in a random fashion while going back to my bedroom.� I placed some on both sides of my bedroom
door, and then closed it.� Once there I
proceed to lock my ankles together with leather cuffs, put on a latex blindfold,
and lock my hands behind my back.� I knew
that I would need to walk down the hall and into the kitchen and open the freezer,
remove the cooler, and let the ice melt before getting free.� Once I had the key, I had to go back down the
hall to unlock myself.� The thumbtacks
were a minor hindrance, but easy to kick out of the way.� I did use the wall as a support to make sure
I did not fall.� While this worked, I
wanted to make it more difficult and a longer period.� I decided that I needed to get more tacks, so
every time I went to a store that had them I bought more.� Eventually I ended up with about two thousand
tacks.� This made it more difficult.

The latex blindfold did not work well so I would try a
leather one the next time.� After another
test, I was still able to move the blindfold enough to see out the bottom so I
decided something else was needed.� What
I found was a leather hood with a gag and blindfold.� Testing the hood along with the latex
blindfold worn under, I could not see any hint of light.� The gag made it even more interesting.� As I progressed, I added restraints at the
knee and switched to better quality handcuffs since the cheap ones that I used
originally popped open when I fell.� Even
with my hands cuffed behind me, I found I still had good use of my hands.� The solution was to this was to take a chain
from my ankles and thread it through the hasp on my collar.� I wanted the chain to pull my hands high up behind
me so they would be useless.� I tried
locking the cuffs to different links on the chain until I found the length that
worked best and made my hands virtually useless when I was standing.� When I bent my legs, it would give me slack
in the chain so that I could use my hands.�
I then cut the remaining chain off so that I only had one choice.� I also wanted a way to restrict the use of my
hands even further.� Many times when I
was ready to try something more restrictive, I would back out before locking my
wrists together.� I even pushed on the
toolbox enough to let the keys slide out.�
I solved this by putting the keys in an envelope and taping it to the
bottom of the toolbox before locking and chaining it.� I also chained it to the bed frame so I could
not push it down the hall ensuring that I would have to make a round trip to get
free.� After experimenting and turning
chicken to to avoid the final click, I was ready to go for it.

For the final key in the ice, I took the only key to the
toolbox lock and froze it in a small cooler (the size that holds two or three
six packs).� I did this because I figured
it would take longer to melt.� First I
filled it half full and put it in my freezer, when frozen I placed the key to
the toolbox in the middle and filled it to the top and put it back in the freezer.� At this point, I had no idea how long it
would take to melt.� I locked a chain to
the handle of the cooler so it would have to stay in the kitchen when I got it
out of the freezer.� I waited a day for
it to freeze solidly and turned the freezer to the coldest setting.� The next day, I looped a short chain
connecting the handles of the refrigerator and freezer (a side-by-side model)
and locked the handles together.� I took
this key and tossed it in the middle of my living room floor.� This was a small key about � inches by � inch
and would be hard to locate even though I knew its approximate location.� Next, I took all of my thumbtacks and spread
them in the hallway placing a greater concentration near areas where I would
have the most trouble, mainly near doorways.�
I decide to leave the closet, bathroom and bedroom doors open since this
made balancing more difficult.� Slowly
working my way to my bedroom, I looked at the number of tacks and knew getting
down the hallway would be difficult and a little painful if any tacks were
stuck in my feet.� Once in the bedroom, I
took a shower and got ready to start my bondage.� The final bondage was to be as complete and
escape proof as I could make it.� 

The first item to go on was a waist strap with a butt plug
attached to a belt going between my legs.�
The front piece had a hole for a strap on, but I used it to hold my cock
and balls.� I pushed them through the
hole so they would be exposed if I fell on any tacks.� Next, I attached the cuffs to my ankles.� These were leather cuffs with two straps with
hasps for locks and a buckling strap in the middle.� I locked them together by overlapping the
hasps and putting the shaft of the padlocks through both hasps.� This made for a more restrictive
binding.� Before closing the padlocks, I
put the ends of two longer chains between them.�
I then took a thin chain, looped it around my big toes, and cinched it
tightly through the middle.� When this
was done, I proceeded to take another chain and pace it under my feet, crossing
it over the instep and locking it snugly together around my ankles.� This would make walking (if you could call it
that) more uncomfortable.� My ankles were
now secure even if I could tear the leather restraints, which were sturdy
enough to make this impossible.� Next
were my knees.� I used a leather strap
with a hasp lock.� It was pulled as
tightly as I could and locked.� Next, I
cinched the leather strap with a chain put the lock through the chain and
wrapped the rest around my knees securing it tightly to the padlock holding the
cinch.� Now my legs and feet were secure.

Now on to the bondage helmet.� This helmet was designed to be very
secure.� It was made of flexible black
leather with eyehole, nose holes, and a mouth hole.� The blindfold part was riveted to the helmet
and had thick pads that more than covered the openings.� The same was true of the gag.� The nose holes remained open with no
covering.� I would put small tubes in the
holes and feed them into my nose to ensure I could breathe easily.� The strap was fed through keepers sewn to the
helmet and each strap had a hasp that would hold a padlock.� The final strap was a chinstrap that fastened
at the top of the head and could be locked.�
The helmet laced in the back with grommets and a heavy leather
lace.� The last feature was a heavy
collar also riveted to the hood.� It was
three inches high and when locked it covered the knot in the lacing. Before
putting the hood on, I placed foam rubber earplugs in my ears and covered them
with wax earplugs.� First, I put on the
latex blindfold.� This helped to hold
heavy foam ear covers that would help me hear nothing.� It took a short time to put the hood on.� I was careful to keep it as smooth as
possible when lacing it as tightly as I could.�
During this process I got off my bed and down on the floor to make
getting up to walk more difficult.� First
I adjusted the gag to be as comfortable as it was going to get, then I reached
backed and locked the gag strap.� Of
course, this effectively locked the hood on.�
Next the blindfold, with the latex blindfold already in place this was
overkill, but it would make sure that I could not see any trace of light.� Again reaching behind my head, I pulled
snugly and locked it in place.� Time for
the chinstrap.� This would snug up the
gag and prevent me from opening my mouth.�
I pulled it tight and locked it.�
Now I was getting closer to the point of no return.� Every time I heard a lock click, I felt it in
my cock.� I was getting harder with every
click!� I took the chain that was
attached to my toes and locked it to a ring in the front of the collar.� I pulled the collar tightly around my neck
and put the lock in place.� This would
really lock the collar on!� I snapped the
lock!� Click!� I was secure in the helmet, my legs were bound
tightly.� The carefully measured chain
from my ankles was the threaded through the hasp and locked to a pair of sturdy
handcuffs.� This chain would pull my
wrists high on my back unless my legs were bent.� Only two things to do now.� I had decided to put on a pair of nipple
clamps to enhance the pleasure/pain aspect.�
They were the type with alligator teeth covered in rubber with a screw
to adjust the tension on the nipples.�
From prior testing, I discovered the rubber would eventually allow the
clip to slide off, so I removed the rubber.�
I found out they hurt!� I fed them
through the chain leading to my collar. The connecting chain was tied to the
chain and I attached short springs to the chain about two inched from the
clamps.� While lying on my stomach with
my feet raised toward my head, I gingerly placed the clamps on my nipples.� The pain was not as bad as I thought it would
be.� However, I had not yet fully
loosened the tension screws.� I lay there
for a while deciding whether to go through with the final steps.� I started to loosen the screws little by
little increasing the discomfort.� I
could still back out, with my hands free, it would not be too bad.� I kept turning the screws and finally and
quickly turned them so they fell out and the full pressure of the clamps hit my
nipples.� They hurt!� Bending my legs to put slack in the chain
holding the cuffs, I reached behind me and put my left wrist in a cuff and
swung the other half over.� Could I close
it?� Was I crazy?� I took my right hand and placed it on the top
half of the cuff.� All I had to do was
push!� First, I heard one click than
another than another, then another! �I
still had one hand free.� Could I
continue?� I wanted to but I was
afraid.� I took the small nail I had
taped to the cuffs and pushed it into the double locking hole.� At least it would not get tighter.� I lay there trying to decide what to do.� Bound as I was, it would be a while to get
free, but not as long as if both hand were bound.� I said �fuck� it and placed my right hand in
the cuff and reached over with my left and quickly pushed it closed!� When I heard the clicks, I came right there!
