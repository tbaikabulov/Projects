Holding the Purse

Synopsis: A romantic day out shopping goes awry when a man accidentally embarrasses his wife while she is trying on lingerie.  She blackmails him into a compromising situation and pushes him into more and more humiliating situations as she gets her revenge.






In retrospect, I suppose I was being a little macho about the whole thing.&nbsp; The punishment definitely didn&#8217;t fit the crime thoughï¿½

 &nbsp; 
It had started as any other Saturday morning.&nbsp; My wife, Victoria,&nbsp; was going shopping with one of her girlfriends for an upcoming holiday party, and I was settling in for watching some football.&nbsp; Then things went downhill.&nbsp; 

Her friend called and said she was a little sick and wasn&#8217;t up for shopping.&nbsp; My wife hung up the phone and looked over at me with her pouty eyes. 

Honey, Marcy can&#8217;t go shopping with me, and I hate to do it alone.&nbsp; I like to have another opinion before I buy something.&nbsp; Can you please, please come shopping with me today?&nbsp; I really need a new outfit for the Benson&#8217;s party next weekend.&nbsp; 

She knew I hated shopping.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry honey, I just can&#8217;t today, I&#8217;ve got to much to do around the house.&nbsp; 
Her: Yeah right, you&#8217;re going to sit there and watch football all day.
C&#8217;mon you&nbsp; bum, will it really kill you to come and support your wife?
She was not giving up.
Me:  It&#8217;s not like that, I just have so much to do, and you know I&#8217;m not a big shopper.&nbsp; Besides that, you have plenty of clothes.&nbsp; 

Her:&nbsp; Seriously, you&#8217;re going there?&nbsp; Gosh you are a pain. Okay, fine.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t see why you just can&#8217;t suck it up.&nbsp; Then she paused.&nbsp; 
I&#8217;ll tell you what, I really want you to go, so I&#8217;ll make you a deal.&nbsp; You come shopping with me, and we can go to the lingerie store and you can pick out some new underwear for me to wear tonight.&nbsp; Then she game me a little wink.&nbsp; 

She knew my weak spot.&nbsp; I loved her in sexy underwear, though she rarely wore it.&nbsp; 
Okay, now we&#8217;re talking.&nbsp; I got up and put my arms around her.&nbsp; But you have to wear anything I pick out. I want to hear you say it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Her, sarcastically pouting.&nbsp; Yes dear, I will wear anything you pick out.&nbsp; 

Hmm, that should make things more interesting.&nbsp; But I think you should wear it all day today.&nbsp;&nbsp; While we&#8217;re at, why don&#8217;t you wear heels and a miniskirt while we&#8217;re shopping too.&nbsp; 
Might as well go for the gold while I&#8217;ve got the leverage. She seemed to be in a pretty playful mood.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

 Holy cow mister, enough already.&nbsp; Fine.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t believe this is what I have to do to get you to come along with me. Sheesh, men.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 


Walking into the mall, I couldn&#8217;t help but admire my wife from behind in her skirt and heels.&nbsp; At 31, she still had that such a great figure.&nbsp; She had gained a little weight since we were married, but still looked fabulous, and it just accented her curves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

At the mall, I made sure our first stop was the lingerie store.&nbsp; Didn&#8217;t want her backing out of her end of the deal after the shopping was done.&nbsp; I made sure we went to a French boutique, not one of those chain places.&nbsp; We walked in together and started looking for something for her.&nbsp; I have to admit I was a little embarrassed as she started picking up lacy bra after bra and asking me if I liked them.&nbsp; Then I saw just the thing I was hoping for.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Her:&nbsp; A corset?&nbsp; You&#8217;ve got to be kidding me.&nbsp; I thought they quit making those a hundred years ago.&nbsp; 

I ran my hands over it and handed it to her.&nbsp; It was a real one too, not one of those stretch elastic things.&nbsp; Steel boning, beautiful brocade, leather laces.&nbsp; It was black with pink ruffles and bows, but despite the girly accents it looked pretty intimidating from the shape that it would force.&nbsp; This baby would knock six inches off of her waist all the way cinched down.&nbsp; 

Me:&nbsp; Hey, a deals a deal and I&#8217;m here aren&#8217;t I?&nbsp; Besides that, it will give you a killer figure, you might actually like it.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve always wanted to see you in one of these.&nbsp; 

Her:&nbsp; Oh my gosh. I meant just lacy panties and a bra.&nbsp; Okay, fine, let&#8217;s just buy it and get out of here. This looks way too small for me though.&nbsp; 

Me:&nbsp; It just looks small because it is narrower at the waist, it&#8217;s supposed to be like that.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll need to try it on first. 

Her:&nbsp; Argh.&nbsp; 
She took the garment and started heading towards the dressing room.  

Me, smiling:&nbsp; Here are your undies too, like the ruffles across the butt of them?
I found some matching black panties with pink ribbons across the rear.&nbsp; I was milking this for all it was worth.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; I can&#8217;t believe you Mitchell. She snatched them from my hands.&nbsp; She was smiling a little bit too though.&nbsp; 
Me:&nbsp; Don&#8217;t forget the stockings for the garters.&nbsp; And put your heels on when come out of the changing room, I want the full effect.&nbsp; She looked back at me with her eyes shooting bullets.&nbsp; I was loving every minute of this.&nbsp; 

I walked back towards the dressing room with my wife.&nbsp; It had a curtain to a small room in the center with changing booths on each side.&nbsp; The booth doors were locked so she needed to go grab a sales lady.&nbsp; There were a couple of them in the store and she went over to a brunette who looked like she could have walked out of a magazine herself.&nbsp; She came over and saw the corset in my wife&#8217;s hand and complimented her on her selection.&nbsp; I could have complimented my wife on her selection as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

The sales lady went back into the changing area and unlocked one of the booths for my wife.&nbsp; I asked her if I could go in to help but the lady said they had a strict one customer to a booth policy.&nbsp;&nbsp; She then replied that my wife would probably need help lacing up the laces as a corset like this needed a special technique, and she could assist.&nbsp; That set my thoughts in motion, this was getting interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

My wife then handed me her purse and asked me to hold it.&nbsp; She mentioned it had her friends tablet computer in it as she was going to return it to her today, so keep a close eye on it.&nbsp; Why do women always have to do that, I don&#8217;t see why they can&#8217;t carry their purse into the changing room.&nbsp; I took it grudgingly and the lady asked me to step outside the curtain area in case other patrons came back.&nbsp; Then the lady began unlacing the corset to begin fitting it on my wife.&nbsp; Wish I could have watched that!&nbsp;&nbsp; 

I was standing outside the changing area waiting, and they were taking their time for sure.&nbsp; The store didn&#8217;t have a chair there so I was stuck standing there holding a purse.&nbsp; A couple a ladies had walked into the store so I kind of held it to my side so they couldn&#8217;t see it, I already felt awkward enough standing in a lingerie store by myself. I called back to my wife and asked how things were going.&nbsp; She said it would be at least a few more minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

I decided to go next door and look at video games so I didn&#8217;t have to stand there.&nbsp; I really didn&#8217;t want to carry a cherry red purse with me though.&nbsp;&nbsp; I stuck the purse in between some clothes on a shelf down low where it would be fine for a few minutes.&nbsp; Then I ran next door to see if they had the new Call of Duty.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

I came back a few minutes later to see if they were ready.&nbsp; My wife was poking her head out from behind the curtain looking for me.&nbsp; 
Where did you go?&nbsp; I was just about to take this thing off and call my end of our deal good.&nbsp; 

Sorry, just ran next door real quick.&nbsp; 
And then I stepped behind the curtain to take a look.&nbsp; 
Holy Crap!&nbsp; She looked incredible.&nbsp;&nbsp; She already had a great figure but the corset molded her waist into a perfect hourglass shape, squeezing her boobs up and almost spilling over the top.&nbsp; The silk garters were pretty sexy on their own, complete with the seam running up the back of them.&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked like an incredibly expensive escort girl.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Honey, you look amazing, I&#8217;m almost speechless.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Her:&nbsp; Well, you&#8217;d better be.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s the most comfortable thing I&#8217;ve ever worn, but you are right, it is damn sexy.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
She was admiring herself in the mirror, turning back and forth.&nbsp; I noticed that the laces in back were about three inches apart.&nbsp; 
Hold on a sec honey, it looks like it is a little loose still.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; It started to feel a little tight so I asked her to stop tightening it. 
Me:&nbsp; Let&#8217;s see what it looks if we really snug it up.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; I think I&#8217;ve done my part already
Me:&nbsp; You said anything I want.&nbsp; You might like it, let&#8217;s just see what it looks like.&nbsp; 
I didn&#8217;t give her a chance to protest again and untied the bow knots in the middle of it and started pulling all of the slack out of the laces.&nbsp; I started at the top and bottom and worked my way towards the middle.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; Holy crap honey, it feels like you&#8217;re cutting me in half.&nbsp; 
Me: Here, put your hands up against the wall and breathe out.&nbsp; 
She did, and I managed to gain another couple inches of ground in getting it together.&nbsp; The laces were only an inch apart now.&nbsp;&nbsp; I quickly tied off each end with a solid knot in the small of her back that she wouldn&#8217;t be able to untie by herself.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t realize it yet but I wasn&#8217;t planning on letting her take it off.&nbsp; 
I flipped her around to look at her.&nbsp; Woah&nbsp; Her figure looked almost impossible, she looked like a barbie doll or something.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her boobs were spilling over the top of the corset, and I could easily grasp her tiny waist. Her chest and breasts were heaving as she tried to take full breaths.&nbsp; It looked so incredibly sexy.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; Wow, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve been this skinny since high school.&nbsp; Okay, I&#8217;ll admit, it looks pretty amazing.&nbsp; But I can barely breathe, I won&#8217;t last more than five minutes in this thing.&nbsp; 
Me:&nbsp; You just need to take shallow breaths and take some time to get used to it.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; No way I&#8217;m getting used to being in this vice press.&nbsp; Okay, you&#8217;ve had your fun, can you undo me?&nbsp; 
Me:&nbsp; Oh no my dear, we had a deal, remember?&nbsp; You&#8217;re wearing it the rest of the day.&nbsp; 
Her, getting concerned:&nbsp; C&#8217;mon honey, no way I can go shopping in this thing, I&#8217;ll pass out after ten minutes.&nbsp; 
Me:&nbsp; Well you seem to be talking just fine right now.&nbsp; Maybe you should save your breathe a little.&nbsp; Besides that, it&#8217;s good, it will remind you to be quick about shopping so we can get home and play.&nbsp; 
I had her right where I wanted her.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; You are a little bastard.&nbsp; Can&#8217;t believe I let you talk me into this one.&nbsp; Most husbands just go shopping with their wives because they are supportive you know? She still had a little playfulness in her voice though, I think she was actually kind of enjoying the whole experience. She was still looking at herself in the mirror at herself, the new figure was quite shocking.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; Fine.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll go get dressed.&nbsp; But you owe me big time for being a good sport on this one.&nbsp; 

She finally accepted her fate.&nbsp; Then she looked over at me:
Hey, where&#8217;s my purse?
Me:&nbsp; Oh, it&#8217;s right outside the changing room
Her:&nbsp; What???&nbsp; You set it down??!
Me:&nbsp; Just relax, I hid it right out here. 
Her entire demeanor just changed.&nbsp; 
Her: Go get it right now you idiot!&nbsp; 
I stepped out from behind the curtain and ran over to the shelf where I hid it.&nbsp; I pulled up the pile of slips it was under.&nbsp; But it wasn&#8217;t there!
She was watching me with her head poked out behind the curtain.&nbsp; 
Well where is it?
Me:&nbsp; I just put it down right here under these clothes...&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; Oh my gosh Mitchell, if you lose my purse and Marcy&#8217;s tablet I will never forgive you.&nbsp; 
Then she came running over to help me.&nbsp; And she was still just wearing the corset and panties!&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t help but stare at her.&nbsp; 
Her: Quite f*cking gaping and find it Mitchell!&nbsp; She started frantically going through the clothes on the same shelf and looking below it. I started looking up to see who could have taken it.&nbsp; Two girls, both in their late teens, were staring right at us.&nbsp; When I looked at them they turned away and started to walk out of the store.&nbsp; 
Her: It&#8217;s not here!&nbsp; Are you sure it was this shelf, where could it have gone?
Me:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know, I swear I left it right here.&nbsp; Maybe somebody swiped it.&nbsp; 

She looked up and started anxiously looking around.&nbsp; I told her those two girls were looking at me and then left the store.&nbsp; She started walking towards them and then started to run.&nbsp; At least as much as she was able to in high heels, it was more a fast walk.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t believe what she was doing, I think she had completely forgotten that she was only wearing underwear.&nbsp; And not even her own for that matter.&nbsp; I ran after her as well, not quite sure what to do.&nbsp; I tried yelling at her that I would take care of it but she so worried about losing that purse by this point that she wasn&#8217;t stopping.&nbsp; A store employee saw us running out of the store, and my wife wearing their merchandise, and started running after us as well.&nbsp; 

In retrospect now I can only imagine the scene we must have made.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not everyday you see a lady running through the mall in a corset and panties, and running in heels only added to the noise we were making.&nbsp; In addition the store lady behind me was hollering at us to stop.&nbsp; More than a few heads were turning to see what was going on.&nbsp; 

She didn&#8217;t catch the girls until they had almost reached the mall courtyard, a good hundred yards outside the store.&nbsp; She grabbed one of them by the arm.&nbsp; 
Excuse me, I&#8217;m sorry to accuse you of this, but did you grab a red purse out of that store?
The girls looked at us dumbfounded. Noï¿½.

Victoria: Then why were you running away?
Them: I don&#8217;t know, that guy you&#8217;re with kept looking up at us and it creeped us out.&nbsp; 
V:&nbsp; Would it be okay if I looked in your bags?
By this time the saleslady had caught up with us.&nbsp; 

Miss, miss, you can&#8217;t leave the store with unpaid for merchandise.&nbsp; 
V:&nbsp; I know, but I think these girls may have stolen my purse.
Saleslady:&nbsp; Was it a cherry red under the arm one?
V: Yes.... 
Saleslady:&nbsp; Oh, I saw it sitting out on the shelf and stuck it under the counter for safekeeping.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

There was a long, uncomfortable pause between all of us right after that.&nbsp; 
Victoria:&nbsp; Oh.&nbsp; (turning red) Oh my gosh.&nbsp; She turned to the girls.&nbsp; I am so sorry to accuse you girls, I saw you hustling away and I just assumedï¿½.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am just so sorry.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Girls:&nbsp; Always the teenager&#8217;s fault isn&#8217;t it?&nbsp; Then they giggled and looked her over.&nbsp; You should probably go back and put some clothes on.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

I don&#8217;t think it was until that point that she even thought about what she was wearing.&nbsp; She looked down at herself for a moment and then literally turned the same color as a tomato.&nbsp; 
She turned back to the saleslady and the girls, almost crying.&nbsp; I am so sorry about all of this, I&#8217;ll go back to the store.&nbsp; Then we all started to look around.&nbsp; Everybody within a hundred yards was staring at us.&nbsp; Even people on the second floor were looking down to see what was going on.&nbsp; People were snickering and whispering, guys jabbing their friends to make sure they were watching, and women with mouth agape.&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of folks even had their smartphones out snapping a picture.&nbsp; Then my wife turned and looked at me with a look that would sink a battleship. 
I can&#8217;t believe you did this to me&nbsp; was all that came out.&nbsp; I felt like I might be better off to just hang myself right there. 

The walk back to the store was the longest hundred yards of both of our lives.&nbsp; My wife tried to hold her head up high and act like it was perfectly natural to be walking around in her underwear.&nbsp; I was trying to walk besides her and silently convey support, I didn&#8217;t dare say a word.&nbsp; 
She looked at me and hissed Get your ass behind me and try to block the view of my butt.&nbsp; I got behind her and tried to walk as close to her as I could.&nbsp; She was clearly just concentrating on putting one foot in front of the other at that point, it was plain to see that it was not happening naturally.&nbsp; Even with everything that just happened, I still couldn&#8217;t believe the view.&nbsp; Her body looked incredible cinched down in the corset.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, we made it back to the safety of the store.&nbsp; She walked straight back into the dressing room area.&nbsp; She looked at me coldly: 
Undo this damn thing now
There was no way I was arguing with her now.&nbsp; So much for her wearing it all day.&nbsp; I started picking at the knot to get it undone,&nbsp; I had tied it pretty tightly. Finally the knot came apart and the laces loosened up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She breathed out like she had been underwater for the last five minutes. 

She held the front up with one hand and tried to go into the booth.&nbsp; It had automatically locked when the door was closed.&nbsp; She looked at me with her eyes shooting lasers and barked at me to get the saleslady to unlock it.&nbsp; 


I came back with the saleslady again and my wife handed her purse to me once more.&nbsp; 
If you set this down again, I will divorce you.&nbsp; 
And with that she walked back into the changing booth.&nbsp; 

I silently waited outside the changing area for her to come out.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t so concerned about standing there holding a cherry red purse this time.&nbsp; I thought about what had just happened and where it went wrong.&nbsp; I was trying to rationalize how it could not be my fault or was a simple accident.&nbsp; I also couldn&#8217;t get the picture of her in that corset out of my head.&nbsp; I think it was the sexiest thing I had ever seen in my life.&nbsp; 

Finally she had changed and came out of the dressing room.&nbsp; 
Me: Honey, I am so sorry for what just happened.&nbsp; It was totally an accident, I had no ideaï¿½
She cut me off.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; Seriously Mitchell, save your breathe.&nbsp; That was the most embarrassing thing that&#8217;s ever happened to me I think.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know how you&#8217;re going to make this one up to me.&nbsp; All because you&#8217;ve got so much male pride you couldn&#8217;t stand there for five minutes holding a purse.&nbsp; 
She handed me the pile of underthings.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; Go put this crap away. 
I realize in retrospect that my timing couldn&#8217;t be worse, but I had wanted to get her a corset for so long and I didn&#8217;t want to give up just yet, I felt like this was my only chance:
Me, timidly:&nbsp; Honey, listen, I know you&#8217;re really upset right now and it was partly my fault.&nbsp; But I should say, you really looked amazing in that corset.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t have to wear it right now, but I really think we should buy it for you while we&#8217;re here.&nbsp; 
Long silence.&nbsp; She just stared at me.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; Seriously Mitchell, seriously?&nbsp; I was just completely humiliated by what was ï¿½partlyï¿½ your fault and you still think you can talk me into buying underwear that is essentially a medieval torture device?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t even know how to respond.&nbsp; 
She stared at me bewildered for a few seconds.&nbsp; Then, suddenly her expression changed.&nbsp; 
Her: You know what Mitchell, fine.&nbsp; You want the damn corset so bad go get it.&nbsp; But at least get the next size up, this one is way too small.&nbsp; 
I thought it fit just fine but I wasn&#8217;t about to argue with her about that right now. I was elated we were still getting it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I took the corset and walked over to the rack to hang it up.&nbsp; I found one in a medium and carried it back into the changing area where she was still waiting.&nbsp; 
I held it up to show it to her. It really was a little large for her frame, the sides would come together in the back and we wouldn&#8217;t be able to tighten it anymore.&nbsp; I decided I had to say something.&nbsp; 
Me:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know honey, this one really does look kind of big for you.&nbsp; I know that one felt uncomfortable but I&#8217;ve read about these and they say it just takes a little while to get used to it.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; Is that so huh?&nbsp; 
She had a strange tone in her voice, sarcastic but almost a little amused.
I was starting to realize I was pushing her too far. Maybe I&#8217;d better just take what I can get.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Me: I&#8217;ll tell you what, if you think that was too small then let&#8217;s just buy this one, you don&#8217;t even need to try it on, I&#8217;m sure it will still fit great.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Her, almost laughing now:&nbsp; Oh, but it&#8217;s not even for me.&nbsp; 
Me, confused: Huh?&nbsp; What do you mean, who is it for then?&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; You.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Me:&nbsp; Uh, what now?
Her: You, my macho man, are going to take that corset and go try it on right now.&nbsp; 
Me:&nbsp; Ha ha.&nbsp; Umm, no I&#8217;m not.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; Oh yes you are.&nbsp; Do you want to know what&#8217;s going to happen if you don&#8217;t?
Woah.&nbsp; She was actually serious about this.&nbsp; 
Me: Honey, listen, I know you&#8217;re really upset right now okay.&nbsp; I am so sorry about all this.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll tell you what, let&#8217;s just forget about this whole thing and our deal and I&#8217;ll go buy you a drink and then shop with you as long as you want. 
Her:&nbsp; Oh, you&#8217;ll wish I would forget about it.&nbsp; You just couldn&#8217;t stop pushing could you?&nbsp; Now, where was I? Oh yes, why you are going to try this on.&nbsp; You are going to go and try this on because if you don&#8217;t, you are never going to catch me in anything even remotely sexy again, do you understand me?&nbsp; 
I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen her so mad.&nbsp;  
Me: Victoria, please, just calm downï¿½
Her:&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t done yet!&nbsp; I&#8217;m serious Mitchell.&nbsp; As soon as we get home, all of those thongs and lacy bras that you always want me to wear are going straight to the thrift shop.&nbsp; We&#8217;re talking all granny panties and shapeless, comfortable full coverage beige bras from this point on.&nbsp; 
Geez, she wasn&#8217;t giving up on this.&nbsp; No more sexy underwear forever?&nbsp; There was no way I could let that happen.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Me:&nbsp; Honey, c&#8217;mon, seriously.&nbsp; It&#8217;s one thing for you to try this on but that&#8217;s ridiculous for a guy to wear something like this.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; Oh really Mitchell?&nbsp; And it wasn&#8217;t ridiculous for me to parade around in front of hundreds of people with this on?&nbsp; If we were going to be even I&#8217;d make you put it on and march you out in front of the store like you just did to me.&nbsp; You should be happy I&#8217;m just asking you to embarrass yourself in the changing room for my personal amusement.&nbsp; 
Ouch.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t letting me off the hook.&nbsp; I was starting to realize that I might not be able to get out of this one.&nbsp; As mad as she was, if I didn&#8217;t do this I could tell I was sleeping on the couch for at least tonight if not longer.&nbsp; She needed to get some kind of payback.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Me:&nbsp; Okay, fine, I&#8217;ll tell you what, I&#8217;ll just try it on and you can have your laugh and then we will be even, okay.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll do it if you agree to buy the corset for yourself afterward.&nbsp; Figured I had to still try.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; Oh no honey, you don&#8217;t get to make demands any more.&nbsp; Now shut the hell up and get your sexy tush in there and let&#8217;s see how much you like this lacy vice press.&nbsp; 
I sighed and resigned myself to my fate.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t believe this, this was crazy.&nbsp; 
Me:&nbsp; Okay, fine, let&#8217;s just make it quick.&nbsp; I took the corset and quickly went into her changing booth.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t believe I was going to do this.&nbsp; 
She knocked on the door:
Oh sweetie, don&#8217;t forget your sexy rhumba panties and stockings for the garters.&nbsp; She was laughing as she said it, and she was talking way too loud for my comfort.&nbsp; I opened the door and grabbed them out of her hands, red as beet.&nbsp; She handed me the same underwear she had just tried on.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t sure if it was going to fit but didn&#8217;t really want to get into a discussion about women&#8217;s underwear sizes right then.&nbsp; I was pretty small for a guy, coming in at a buck forty and about five foot eight inches in height.&nbsp; I only had about twenty pounds on my wife.&nbsp; In fact, she often borrowed my shirts and said they fit pretty well, so I figured it wouldn&#8217;t be too far off.&nbsp; I wanted to get this over with as fast as possible.&nbsp; 

Once in the dressing room, I realized that the practicalities of a corset and garters aren&#8217;t so great.&nbsp; She wouldn&#8217;t come in the changing booth to help me, which meant I would have to go out into the dressing room area to have her help me.&nbsp; No way I wanted to stand out there and risk somebody walking back here.&nbsp;&nbsp; The corset had these holes and metal posts on the front to hold the front together.&nbsp; Clearly it was built to take a lot of force.&nbsp; I tried to tighten the back first and tie it off, and then hook the posts in the holes, but there was no way I could pull the front together.&nbsp; I ended up putting it on and then reaching around me to tighten the laces a little, but it was tough to reach them and pull them at the right angle.&nbsp; Finally I kind of tightened it up and figured that was good enough.&nbsp; Then I put on the panties, which I realized really did look ridiculous with all of the ruffles across the butt, and it took me about another five minutes to get the garters on and figure out how to attach them to the stockings.&nbsp; 
Finally, I had it all together.&nbsp; I looked in the mirror to see how ridiculous I looked.&nbsp; I was actually a little surprised.&nbsp; The stockings definitely made my legs look feminine, despite the hair poking through them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though I wasn&#8217;t able to tighten the corset very tight, it still gave me a feminine shape, and almost gave me the appearance of small boobs up top from my chest being pushed up.&nbsp; Now, looking in the mirror, from the neck down appeared to be a female body, and not a bad looking one at that. Maybe I lacked the curves and had hairy legs but all of the pink stitching and bows definitely made it look feminine.&nbsp; I turned back and forth checking out the view and debating if I could actually go through with showing my wife.&nbsp; Then I heard something at the door.&nbsp; 

Her:&nbsp; Wow, you really like your new undies huh? She was on tip toes staring down at me through the slats in the door.&nbsp; 
Me, stammering:&nbsp; No... I was just seeing how ridiculous it looked first that&#8217;s all.&nbsp; &nbsp; 
Her: Uh-huh, sure.&nbsp; Open up panty ass, I want to see the full picture of my new lovely girlfriend. 
I was turning so red I think I was going to match the color of her purse.&nbsp; I cracked the door and peeked out, making make sure nobody else was back there.&nbsp; All clear.&nbsp; I looked at her and she was almost cracking up laughing, she was clearly enjoying my humiliation.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; C&#8217;mon panty boy, let&#8217;s see it.&nbsp; 
Geez I was worried one of the salesladies would hear on the other side of the curtain.&nbsp; 
I opened the door the rest of the way.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve ever been so embarrassed.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; Wow, look at you sexy.&nbsp; If it wasn&#8217;t for that little thing sticking straight out from your crotch I&#8217;d almost of thought you were a woman.&nbsp; Looks like somebody likes being wrapped in lace.&nbsp; She laughed and grabbed my hardon.&nbsp; Why the hell was that happening? I wasn&#8217;t sure if it was the underwear or the fact that she was taking charge like this that was doing it for me.&nbsp; I turned even redder if that were possible.&nbsp; 
Me:&nbsp; Okay, happy now?&nbsp; 
Oh no, get out here, I want the full modelling strut.&nbsp; 
Me:&nbsp; Damnit Victoria.&nbsp;&nbsp; I listened to make sure nobody was walking our way in the store.&nbsp; I could hear some movement and other people in the store but had no idea if they were coming to try things on or not.&nbsp; I sucked it up and came out of the changing booth.&nbsp; I walked past her, stopped, spun, said there you go, and started to retreat to the safety of the booth.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; Oh no you don&#8217;t little lady.&nbsp;&nbsp; First we need to crank down the straps on your corset, really try it on right like you did with me, remember?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I looked at her and grimaced.&nbsp; 
Fine, but let&#8217;s go back into the changing booth, somebody could walk back here any second.&nbsp; 
Her, mockingly:&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry but they have a strict one person to a booth policy.&nbsp; Now turn around and let&#8217;s do you up nice and tight.&nbsp; 
This was too much.&nbsp; Somebody could walk back at any second. I was done.&nbsp; 
No, I&#8217;ve done my part, enough already, you&#8217;ve got your revenge.&nbsp; I started to pull away from her and head back to the booth.&nbsp; She had positioned herself between me and the booth though and was blocking my path.&nbsp; Then she turned around and pulled the booth door closed!&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; There, that will teach you to listen.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll tell you when we&#8217;re even, not you. 
Me:&nbsp; Oh my god Victoria, it automatically locks!&nbsp; I ran to the door and pushed on it.&nbsp; Locked.&nbsp; I frantically twisted and pushed on the doorknob.&nbsp; Not a chance.&nbsp; These were full doors too, not the half booth doors that you could crawl under.&nbsp; I would have had no problem getting down on my hands and knees and crawling under at this point.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t believe it.&nbsp; I was standing there in a women&#8217;s clothing store, fully decked out in women&#8217;s lingerie, locked out of the changing room.&nbsp; We would have to get the saleslady to let me back in!&nbsp; I frantically ran and checked the other three changing booths to see if one was unlocked.&nbsp; I could hide in there while she brought the saleslady to unlock my booth.&nbsp; No luck, all were locked.&nbsp; I turned back to Victoria shaking, desperately trying to think of a plan where we could get the door open without anybody seeing me.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry I had to do that but you couldn&#8217;t just do as your told.&nbsp; 
Me:&nbsp; I can&#8217;t believe you just did that.&nbsp; How are we going to get back in?
Her, smirking:&nbsp; I guess you&#8217;re going to go out into the store to grab a saleslady, won&#8217;t you?&nbsp; She paused to enjoy the look of shock on my face.&nbsp; Or if you do as your told and follow my instructions exactly I might go get the key for you.&nbsp; Who knows, you might actually learn to do as your told yet today.&nbsp; &nbsp; 
Holy crap she had me pinned.&nbsp; I was so stunned I could barely talk.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Her: Now, the only thing I want to hear come out of your mouth is Yes Dear.&nbsp; You got that girlfriend?&nbsp; 
Me, mumbling:&nbsp; Fine.&nbsp; Just please hurry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Smack!&nbsp; She planted her right palm right on my left butt cheek.&nbsp; Ouch!&nbsp; It stung a bit but I was more worried as I&#8217;m sure anyone in the store could hear it.&nbsp; 
Me:&nbsp; I mean yes dear, yes dear!&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; Good, you are capable of learning.&nbsp; Now you&#8217;ve got a pretty pink handprint on your butt to match the pink ruffles on your panties.&nbsp; She was trying to hold herself together from cracking up as she said it.&nbsp; Now, where were we?&nbsp; Oh yes, come put your hands against the wall and let&#8217;s cinch you down.&nbsp; 
Me, whispering resignedly:&nbsp; yes dear.&nbsp; 
I couldn&#8217;t believe this.&nbsp; My mind was almost frozen I was such a state of shock.&nbsp; I put my hands against the wall and my wife began taking her time slowly pulling the strings tight.&nbsp; And any moment somebody could walk back there.&nbsp; Even worse, she didn&#8217;t really know how to lace it up, so it was taking her a while.&nbsp; I realized I had no negotiating position left.&nbsp; Time to beg.&nbsp; 
Me:&nbsp; Dear, I realize now how deeply I have humiliated you, and I deserve whatever you do to me.&nbsp; But somebody could walk back here any moment now, and do you really want them to see your husband like this?&nbsp; What if it&#8217;s somebody we know?&nbsp; I could literally be the laughing stock of our friends for something like this.&nbsp; 

Her:&nbsp; You&#8217;re still negotiating, aren&#8217;t you?&nbsp;&nbsp; You need to realize that you&#8217;re not in control here, you have no say.&nbsp; Now, you&#8217;re going to do exactly as I say if you want to get back into that changing room before someone walks back here, do you understand me?&nbsp; It had been at least a couple of minutes now that I had been standing back here in my undies.&nbsp; Well her undies anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I stopped to consider my options.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t think there was much more she could do to me, she had to let me back in.&nbsp; 
Me: Okay, fine.&nbsp; 
Her, smiling:&nbsp; Did you mean yes dear? 
Me:&nbsp; Yes dear.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; Okay, that&#8217;s better.&nbsp; Now how about we have you do a pose for me so I can remember how pretty you look?
I was speechless for a moment as I looked at her.&nbsp; 
Me:&nbsp; Honey, c&#8217;mon, no pictures, this is embarrassing enough already. 
Her:&nbsp; Okay, I&#8217;ll guess we&#8217;ll do a lot of poses then.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t learn, do you?&nbsp; Only one thing is allowed to come out of your mouth.&nbsp; 
Me, slowly:&nbsp; Yes dear.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; You know something honey?&nbsp; I have to admit, this is really turning me on watching you at my complete mercy.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
What the hell had gotten into my wife?&nbsp; I was trying to figure out which would be worse, me walking out in the store in women&#8217;s underwear, or my wife taking pictures of me.&nbsp; I poked my head out of the curtain to see how many people were in the store or if I could summon a saleslady.&nbsp; No luck, they were all helping customers.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; That little act of insubordination will cost you.&nbsp; Now, put your back up against the wall there, and act like you&#8217;re really enjoying yourself before somebody comes back here to try something on, I&#8217;m sure you will make their day.&nbsp; 
I didn&#8217;t have any options.&nbsp; Reluctantly I stepped back and slowly leaned up against the wall and grimaced.&nbsp; Click went her phone.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; Oh no dear, show me that smile,&nbsp; you need to convince me you&#8217;re really enjoying that underwear if you want to get back into that room.&nbsp; 
I couldn&#8217;t believe this.&nbsp; A picture was one thing, but this would look like I was actually modelling for her willingly, like I wanted to do this.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;m waiting.&nbsp; 
I forced a smile.&nbsp; 
Her: Not good enough.&nbsp; That just cost you one more pose.&nbsp; 
I did my best to force a real smile.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not easy to do when you&#8217;re as nervous as you&#8217;ve ever been in your life to get out of the current situation.&nbsp; 
click
I had no idea how I was going to explain that picture.&nbsp; I was standing in women&#8217;s lingerie, in a changing room at a women&#8217;s lingerie store, smiling at the camera.&nbsp; I would have to erase it later.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; Okay, lets try it from the back gorgeous.&nbsp; Spin for me.&nbsp; 
I turned around.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; Wow toots, I&#8217;ve gotta say, from the back you&#8217;ve got a hell of a figure.&nbsp; Most women would kill to look like this.&nbsp; You could almost pass a girl from the rear you know?&nbsp; 
Me:&nbsp; Great, just what I&#8217;ve always dreamed of.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; That sarcasm will cost you.&nbsp; You need a couple of more touches to pull it off I think.&nbsp; Here, take my shoesï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp; And she undid the strap on her heels and handed them to me.&nbsp; 
Me: Honey, c&#8217;mon, I can&#8217;t fit in your shoes.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; They&#8217;re strappy sandals and are adjustable, I&#8217;m sure you can squeeze into them.&nbsp; Now, that didn&#8217;t sound like yes dear.&nbsp; Looks like you&#8217;ll need some clips in your hair too to get the look just right.&nbsp; 
Me, sighing:&nbsp; Yes dear.&nbsp; 
I took the shoes and tried to open up the straps as much as I could.&nbsp; Then I awkwardly balanced on one foot while I squeezed my foot into the left one.&nbsp; I managed to get it on.&nbsp; I tried to balance on it while I put on the other shoe but I could tell there was no way I&#8217;d be able to, I was suddenly three inches taller and these things were unstable as hell.&nbsp; That&#8217;s all I needed was to hurt myself while I was looking like this and have the paramedics back here too.&nbsp; 
Victoria:&nbsp; Here, let me help you there long legs.&nbsp; She got down and I held onto her for balance as she fastened them both up.&nbsp; While she was down there she fondled my crotch a little bit through the panties.&nbsp; The traitor attached to my groin sprung to attention.&nbsp; Then, while I was tottering on the heels, she got up and put a couple of hair clips in my hair.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have long hair or anything but I&#8217;m pretty proud of my full head of hair so I usually keep it a decent length, enough to part it so it doesn&#8217;t stick out.&nbsp; She pulled parts of it back in certain places and clipped it back.&nbsp; She stepped back to admire her work.&nbsp; 
Hot damn honey, those heels give you some sexy legs.&nbsp; And they make your ass stick out a bit too, woah baby.&nbsp; 
Damnit I was getting tired of this.&nbsp; And tired of feeling vulnerable, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d ever felt so helpless.&nbsp; I was racking my brain but still couldn&#8217;t think of any way to get out of it.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; Okay, last pose, if you&#8217;re good.&nbsp; Flip back around.&nbsp; 
I did once again.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; Wow, now you really look like a girl from the back, that corset is giving you some pretty intense curves.&nbsp; You&#8217;re almost a perfect 34-26-34, isn&#8217;t that what guys dream about?&nbsp; 
Me:&nbsp; Very funny
Her: Okay, bend over and put your hands on your knees, just like a sexy playboy bunny.&nbsp; Look away from the camera.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Oh my gosh.&nbsp; This was ridiculous.&nbsp; I opened my mouth to say something and then thought better of it.&nbsp; Better to just bite my tongue and get it over with.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; What&#8217;s that dear, I couldn&#8217;t hear you?
Me.&nbsp; Argh.&nbsp; yes dear.&nbsp; 
I tried to bend over but it was pretty difficult with the corset keeping my back perfectly straight.&nbsp; Balancing on these heels didn&#8217;t help.&nbsp; The result was that my back was arched and my butt was sticking straight out.&nbsp; I had to bend my knees to hold the position.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not sure which was worse, the embarrassment or the strain of holding this position.&nbsp; This was brutal.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; My oh my honey, you are quite the site to see right now.&nbsp; With your head turned you look like one of those old pinnup models.&nbsp; Click.&nbsp;&nbsp; You could definitely pass as a woman from this angle.&nbsp; Click. Ok, turn your head back so we can see your face this time and I can prove that it&#8217;s you in these pics and not some model.&nbsp; 
damnit damnit.&nbsp; Click
Her:&nbsp; Damn honey, I can&#8217;t believe you are actually doing this.&nbsp; You wanted me in sexy underwear bad enough to stand there like that huh?&nbsp; She held up her phone to show me.&nbsp; This has got to be about the most embarrasing pic I&#8217;ve ever seen.&nbsp; Look at your hardon sticking out there, it proves you were enjoying it too.&nbsp; 
Once again I turned a nice shade of crimson.&nbsp; 
Do you realize with these pics I own you now?&nbsp; Who&#8217;s my bitch, huh?&nbsp; Who&#8217;s my bitch?&nbsp; Say it and I&#8217;ll let you back into the dressing room.&nbsp; 
I had lost any sense of pride or self respect by this point.&nbsp; Just make this end.&nbsp; 
Me:&nbsp; I am dear
Her: What are you?
Me:&nbsp; I&#8217;m your bitch.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; Jeez that makes me wet just hearing it.&nbsp; And don&#8217;t think I haven&#8217;t noticed that your little guy is still trying to break out of his lace prison down there.&nbsp; I think you kind of like this don&#8217;t you girly, admit it?&nbsp;&nbsp; She fondled him a little more.&nbsp; 
That accusation was even worse
Me: No, I uh, I don&#8217;t know,&nbsp; . 
Her: I&#8217;d have to admit you look pretty hot from the neck down, I&#8217;m a little jealous missy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
She was milking this for all it was worth

Me:&nbsp; Honey, please, I can&#8217;t take anymore, somebody can walk back here any moment.&nbsp; How many times can I say I&#8217;m sorry.&nbsp; Please, if you will go get the key from the saleslady right now, I promise that you can do whatever you want to me when we get home.&nbsp; 

Her:&nbsp; That&#8217;s better, your attitude is improving.&nbsp; Anything I want huh?&nbsp; Okay, you got a deal missie.&nbsp; Now don&#8217;t wander over to the video game store again huh?&nbsp; She smiled and patted me on the butt.&nbsp; She was enjoying this way too much.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t believe how much she decided to take control, I had never seen her like this.&nbsp; Regardless, right now I just wanted more than anything in the world to get my clothes back.&nbsp; She got down to help me take the shoes off so she could put them back on, I was grateful for that much at least.&nbsp; Then she left to find the key to open the changing booth door.&nbsp; 

There was no where to hide in the dressing room.&nbsp; There wasn&#8217;t even a bench to sit on to act like it&#8217;s normal for a man to be hanging out in a dressing room in lingerie.&nbsp; I tried sitting on the ground, leaned against a wall, crossed my legs, was trying anything to figure out how to best cover myself.&nbsp; 

The wait was pure torture.&nbsp; There were only bad and worse options that could happen here.&nbsp; Either my wife would tell the saleslady my situation and get the key from her, or the saleslady would walk back there to help me, or worse yet other patrons would walk back there to try something on.&nbsp; I was desperately trying to think of excuses for a perfectly normal reason I would be there looking like this.&nbsp; The best I could come up with was that I lost a bet to my wife.&nbsp; I guess I would go with that.&nbsp; 

My wife seemed to be taking her time.&nbsp; At least a couple of minutes had passed since she left.&nbsp; I realized she was probably just trying to torment me.&nbsp; It was definitely working.&nbsp; This was too much though, if someone walked back there I couldn&#8217;t imagine what I would do.&nbsp; I felt like a condemned man awaiting my fate.&nbsp; 

Suddenly I could hear women talking, and the voices were coming my direction.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t my wife&#8217;s voice either!&nbsp; I turned to at least act like I was trying to get back into the changing booth.&nbsp; A saleslady came behind the curtain and looked right at me with eyes as big as saucers.&nbsp; Then my wife came in right behind her.&nbsp; 
Victoria:&nbsp; Thanks for coming back, I realize this is a little unusual.&nbsp; I just couldn&#8217;t figure out how to get the the laces very tight and my husband had been looking forward to getting one of these for a long time.&nbsp; 

What?!&nbsp; She was trying to convince the saleslady this was my idea?&nbsp; Well, I guess in a way it was, but for her, not for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

Saleslady, trying to get her composure:&nbsp; It&#8217;s okay, these corsets are quite tricky.&nbsp; Then she quickly added:&nbsp; Even for a woman.&nbsp; 
Me:&nbsp; It&#8217;s okay really, I think all we really need at this point is for you to open the door to the changing booth as we accidentally locked ourselves out.&nbsp; 
Victoria, chuckling:&nbsp; Oh don&#8217;t be embarrassed sweetie, you wanted to do this for so long so we should at least do it right and make sure we got you the right size, don&#8217;t you think? I know how much you wanted one you could really tighten down.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure they have lots of crossdressers who come in here buying women&#8217;s underwear, don&#8217;t you?
Saleslady:&nbsp; Uh, well, to tell you the truth we do have quite a few guys buy women&#8217;s underwear that I&#8217;m sure was meant for them, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen any of them brave enough to try it on here.&nbsp; 
I cringed and starting turning beet red once again.&nbsp; This was unbelievable, my wife had convinced her I wanted this. I was fumbling for something to say to get her to just open the damn door.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
Me: I&#8217;m sorry, this was probably terribly inappropriate.&nbsp; If you could just open the door we&#8217;ll be going.&nbsp; 
Saleslady:&nbsp; It&#8217;s okay, you&#8217;ve already got it on and your wife will need to know how to lace it up properly, these are tough to get tight.&nbsp; Turn and put your hands up over your head against the wall.&nbsp; 
Please just tell me this is a bad dream and make it stop.&nbsp; I realized that the faster we got this done the faster she would open the door.&nbsp; My wife just stood there smiling at me trying not to laugh.&nbsp; I finally complied.&nbsp; 
Saleslady:&nbsp; Now, it works best if you start at the top and bottom and work your way to the middle.&nbsp; Grab these laces here and take out as much slack as you can.&nbsp; 
I could feel it start really pulling into my chest, even tighter than my wife had it.&nbsp; I looked down and was staring at my own little boobs as my pecs were being squeezed together and up.&nbsp; 
Saleslady: As you approach the middle, you can really crank into the laces, they can take as much as you can give them.&nbsp; Breathe out sir and I&#8217;ll tie it off. 
Oh my gosh, I felt like my rib cage was going to collapse.&nbsp; My wife was right, this was definitely not comfortable.&nbsp; 
Victoria:&nbsp; Oh honeyï¿½.
I turned to look and see what she was up to now.&nbsp; Click.&nbsp; She had her smartphone pointed right at me.&nbsp; What the hell?&nbsp; She had just taken a picture of me.&nbsp; In women&#8217;s lingerie.&nbsp; In a store dressing room. Getting willingly laced into a corset by a store employee.&nbsp; It took me a second to process what had just happened.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Me: No no no, no way, no more pictures!&nbsp; I lunged towards her to grab the phone to erase all of the pictures off it, I was done with this game.&nbsp; She stepped back though and went behind the curtain to go out into the store.&nbsp; Crap!&nbsp; I poked my head out from behind the curtain.&nbsp; She was standing about ten feet away from me, holding the phone in the air taunting me.&nbsp; 
Victoria:&nbsp; Here it is honey, come and get it.&nbsp; I looked around the store.&nbsp; There were about five women there shopping.&nbsp; I realized there was no way I could go out there dressed as I was.&nbsp; Deflated, I gave up and pulled my head back inside.&nbsp; I turned back to the saleslady.

Me:&nbsp; Well, I guess it fits just fine, thanks for the help, can you unlock the dressing room now.&nbsp; 
Saleslady:&nbsp; Sure, okay.&nbsp; It might be a little small on you though actually, do you want to try a larger size?&nbsp; 
I wasn&#8217;t sure how to respond.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t really want to go through this again.&nbsp; 
Me: Oh, I think it&#8217;s fine, if you could just open the door. 
She finally put her key in the door and opened it up.&nbsp; Hallelulah!
My wife walked back into the dressing room.&nbsp; 
 Victoria:&nbsp; Thanks for all of the help, he looks fabulous.&nbsp; 
The saleslady chuckled and said no problem.&nbsp; I let her know we were probably good and then she left the changing booth area thankfully.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 

As soon as she left, I quickly grabbed Victoria before she could run outside the curtain again. 
Me:&nbsp; Give me that phone, time for those pictures to go bye bye.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; Afraid that&#8217;s not going to be too easy for you Missy.&nbsp; You see, all of the pictures I take on my phone are backed up to my online storage on the cloud, and you&#8217;ll need my password to access that.&nbsp; Just to be safe I went ahead and emailed a couple pics to my personal email too.&nbsp; She was grinning from ear to ear.&nbsp; She seemed to be really enjoying this.&nbsp; 
Me:&nbsp; Victoria, c&#8217;mon, don&#8217;t even joke about that, you&#8217;re not going to send those pictures out.&nbsp; It would be humiliating for you too you know?&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; Well, maybe I&#8217;ll just send them to a few select friends and let them know this was what you wanted to do to try to get me to buy a corset.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll bet my friend Marcy would die laughing at this one.&nbsp; 
Damnit.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t tell if she was serious or not.&nbsp; I had never seen her in this mood before.&nbsp; 
One last thing to do before you put your clothes back on.&nbsp; She came up behind me and started fooling with the straps on the corset.&nbsp; Breath all the way out.&nbsp; 
She cinched down on the corset hard one last time.&nbsp; Oomph.&nbsp; 
Her: Look at that, I think I just got the corset another inch together.&nbsp; Now you&#8217;re waist is down to 25 inches, you&#8217;re skinnier than me girlfriend.&nbsp; 
I couldn&#8217;t believe she was able to get it even tighter.&nbsp; I tried to get in air.&nbsp; She took her time as she tied off the straps. 
Oh, and remember, the same rules go for you as went for me.&nbsp; Leave all of your pretty things on and put your clothes over the top, that&#8217;s what you were going to make me do, remember?&nbsp; Ironic that it&#8217;s you wearing it now, isn&#8217;t it?&nbsp;&nbsp; Disobey and those pictures are going out.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I wasn&#8217;t sure I wanted to test her on that.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; And hand me your boxers and socks, you won&#8217;t be needing those.&nbsp; She broke down laughing as I handed them over.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

I was so grateful to be back in the safety of the dressing room.&nbsp; The feeling of knowing anybody could have walked back at any moment almost caused me to have a nervous breakdown.&nbsp; Now I was debating whether or not I should listen to my wife and leave all of this crap on.&nbsp; As I thought about it, I realized there was no way I could wear that corset the rest of the day.&nbsp; It was too uncomfortable.&nbsp; I was pretty sure she wasn&#8217;t going to send those pictures out too.&nbsp; I was going to take it off.&nbsp; 

I tried undoing the button slides on the front but there was no way they would be budge with as much tension as they were under.&nbsp; I reached around me and grabbed at the knots she had tied.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t get a grip on it at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked behind me in the mirror as best I could.&nbsp; It was a pretty solid knot.&nbsp; 
Victoria, outside the door:&nbsp; C&#8217;mon girlfriend, quit admiring your pretty undies, we don&#8217;t have all day.&nbsp; 
Crap.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t going to be able to get it off. 
Well, I figured that if I couldn&#8217;t get the corset off I might as well leave the panties and stockings on to avoid pissing her off, they weren&#8217;t that bad.&nbsp; I put my clothes back on.&nbsp; My jeans were dark and covered the stockings, at least enough that you couldn&#8217;t tell they weren&#8217;t socks.&nbsp; When I sat down though the pants rode a little high for my liking.&nbsp; I&#8217;d have to be careful about that.&nbsp; 
I came out of the dressing room happy to have my clothes back on.&nbsp; 
She reached under my clothes and groped my butt and legs to make sure everything was still there.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; Good girl, you&#8217;re learning.&nbsp; 
Me:&nbsp; Okay, let&#8217;s get the hell out of here.
Her:&nbsp; Aren&#8217;t you forgetting something there now missy? 
Me:&nbsp; Uh, whatï¿½
Well you&#8217;ve got to pay for all of your lovely lingerie, you weren&#8217;t going to steal it where you?
Oh crap.&nbsp; Forgot about that.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; I should&#8217;ve waited until you walked out of the store and mall security had to stop you while wearing stolen women&#8217;s underwear.&nbsp; Man oh man, you probably would make late night talk show&#8217;s for that oneï¿½.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Thank goodness she wasn&#8217;t that heartless.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; Okay, let me get the tags for you.
She reached under my shirt and pulled the tag up and out from the center front of the corset, and then flipped me around and grabbed it off of the back of the panties.&nbsp; She pulled nice and hard, given me a wedgie.&nbsp; I reached back to pull it out and she stopped me.&nbsp; 
Victoria:&nbsp; No you don&#8217;t missy, just leave it like that for a while, you can experience the joy of a thong, girls need to get used to underwear riding in their ass.&nbsp; 
The tag for the stockings was on the envelope they came in.&nbsp; She handed the tags to me.&nbsp; 
Her:&nbsp; Have fun buying these, try not to blush like you&#8217;re wearing em.&nbsp; A wicked grin came over her face.&nbsp; She was enjoying this too much.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

I approached the counter with tags in hand trying to think about what I would say as to where the items were.&nbsp; There was one lady in line ahead of us.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the saleslady that had helped us earlier was helping somebody else.&nbsp; I thought about waiting for her but my wife was having none of it.&nbsp; By the time our turn at the register came up there was another lady in line behind me.&nbsp; I came up with a plan as I handed the tags to the saleslady.&nbsp; 
Me:&nbsp; I hope it&#8217;s okay, my wife really liked the items and decided to wear them out of the store.&nbsp; 
Victoria, turning to me:&nbsp; So that&#8217;s your play huh?
I blushed a little.&nbsp; I hoped the lady behind me wasn&#8217;t paying attention.&nbsp; At least my wife left it at that.&nbsp; The saleslady looked at me a second time but then went about ringing up the items.&nbsp; I think she knew, but she didn&#8217;t say anything.&nbsp; I was grateful I was going to get out of this with only moderate embarrassment.&nbsp; Then I hit a speedbump.&nbsp; 
Saleslady:&nbsp; So that will be $173.&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked at my wife.&nbsp; Ma&#8217;am, if you wouldn&#8217;t mind stepping behind the counter I&#8217;ll need to deactivate the security control tag on the items.&nbsp; 
What? 
Victoria, stiffling a laugh:&nbsp; Well, this will be interesting.&nbsp; Actually, I&#8217;m not wearing them right now.&nbsp; 
Saleslady:&nbsp; Well where are they?
Victoria, almost cracking up now :&nbsp; Mitchell, will you answer the nice ladies question? 
I froze like a deer in the headlights.&nbsp; 
Me:&nbsp; Well, uh, actuallyï¿½
My brain raced.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t think of any alternative.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lady was staring at me with an eye raised.&nbsp; Time to face the music. 
Me, whispering:&nbsp; I uh, lost a bet to my wife.&nbsp; She&#8217;s making me wear them. 
My wife burst out laughing and the saleslady snickered and almost burst out laughing too as she looked at my wife, but then got control of herself.&nbsp; 
Saleslady:&nbsp; I see.&nbsp; Well then sir, I guess it will be you that needs to come around the counter then.&nbsp; 
Damnit.&nbsp; Now the lady behind us was definitely paying attention, and I noticed another woman who was browsing in the store looking over.&nbsp; 
Saleslady, trying not to laugh:&nbsp; So let&#8217;s see, you&#8217;ve got tags for a corset, rhumba panties, and silk stockings.&nbsp; Are you wearing all of them?
Me, trying to blow it off: Yep, unfortunately.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Saleslady:&nbsp; Okay, you&#8217;ll need to lift up your shirt sir so I can deactivate the tag on the corset, it&#8217;s right between the breasts in the top of the center.&nbsp; 
 Okay, now this was worse than the dressing room.&nbsp; I tried to turn my back so nobody could see and pulled up my shirt.&nbsp; I attempted to keep the back tucked in but I couldn&#8217;t pull the front up high enough.&nbsp; It came up to reveal my 25 inch torso and lacy chest to anyone in the store.&nbsp; I closed my eyes and tried to imagine I was somewhere else to get it over with.&nbsp; My wife wasn&#8217;t about to let me off the hook so easy though. 
Victoria:&nbsp; Doesn&#8217;t that corset give him the best looking figure?&nbsp; I wish I was that skinny.&nbsp; 
Saleslady:&nbsp; It really does look lovely on you sir.
Me: I told you, she made me do this.&nbsp; I could tell she wasn&#8217;t buying it.&nbsp; 
Victoria:&nbsp; It even gives him some cleavage doesn&#8217;t it?&nbsp; Though I have to admit I wish he was more than an A cup.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Saleslady:&nbsp;&nbsp; Well you know, we do have silicon inserts that we carry for women that have had masectomies.&nbsp; They could fit right under the top of the corset and would do the trick.&nbsp; 
Victoria:&nbsp; Oh yes, that&#8217;s a great idea, maybe we could try them?&nbsp; 
No way.&nbsp; This wasn&#8217;t happening out here.&nbsp; 
Saleslady:&nbsp; Sure, what cup size do you want him to be?&nbsp; Neither of them was even acting like I had a say in the matter at this point.&nbsp; 
Me, trying to whisper: Honey, c&#8217;mon, not out here. 
Victoria: Now be a good girl and do as your told and it will only be a C cup, but one more word of protest and we&#8217;re going to a D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I couldn&#8217;t believe she was talking to me like this in public.&nbsp; I stared at her and started to open my mouth, then just closed it.&nbsp; She had already shown she would make good on her threats.&nbsp; 
The saleslady chuckled as she realized my lack of control.&nbsp; She picked up a radio and called back to somebody to bring up some silicon inserts.&nbsp; 
Saleslady:&nbsp; So we&#8217;re going with a C then?
Victoria looked at me.&nbsp; Well?
Me, after a pause:&nbsp; Yes dear.&nbsp;  
Saleslady: So what was this bet about, this must have been good.&nbsp; 
Me:&nbsp; Well, uhï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp; I hadn&#8217;t thought about that detail yet.&nbsp; The saleslady looked at me even more suspiciously, like it was just an excuse.&nbsp; 
Victoria:&nbsp; Oh, he lost to me in arm wrestling.&nbsp; 
The saleslady and the lady behind us, who was intently following all of this, now both stared at me and then looked over at my wife.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Saleslady:&nbsp; Wow, your wife must be really strong for her size.&nbsp; I was pretty sure I heard sarcasm in her voice. 
Me:&nbsp; Well, uh, she used two handsï¿½
Victoria shook her head no slightly while smiling.&nbsp; There was no way they believed I didn&#8217;t do this to myself now.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Saleslady:&nbsp; Okay, the security tag on the panties is in the rear, flip around sir.&nbsp; If you would sir I&#8217;d rather not reach under your pants, can you pull up the tag to your panties?&nbsp; 
Both the lady in line and the one trying to pretend to shop definitely heard that.&nbsp; I reached back and pulled the tag up from underneath my pants, further wedging the panties up my butt.&nbsp; 
Saleslady:&nbsp; Very nice selection.&nbsp; She turned to my wife:  He&#8217;s got an excellent fashion sense, they match well.&nbsp; Damnit, she definitely thought this was my doing.&nbsp; 
Saleslady:&nbsp; And the stockings fortunately don&#8217;t have a control tag on them, wouldn&#8217;t want you taking off your pants now would we?&nbsp; The saleslady was grinning now.&nbsp; 

Another sales girl came out from the back with what I could only presume were the inserts in hand.&nbsp; She brought them to the front counter and showed them to my wife.&nbsp; 
Saleslady#2: Is this what you had in mind?
They looked pretty huge to me for a C cup but I didn&#8217;t want to say a word, I was hoping we could just put them in the bag and get out of here.&nbsp; 
Victoria: Yep, looks about right, but is it okay if we try them on real quick?&nbsp; 
Saleslady:&nbsp; Sure, no problem.&nbsp; Do you want to step back into the changing room or if he wants to unbutton his shirt I could just slip them in the top.&nbsp; She grinned as she said it, she knew which one my wife would choose.&nbsp; 
Victoria:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think he has any secrets left at this point.&nbsp; Go ahead and unbutton your shirt dear.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I had thought it couldn&#8217;t get worse but was wrong.&nbsp; I had lost any control over my fate at this point.&nbsp; I started quickly unbuttoning the shirt, trying to get this over with as soon as possible.&nbsp; All of the women in the store were openly gaping at me now.&nbsp;&nbsp; I stood there holding my shirt open while the saleslady approached me with these large fake breasts.&nbsp; I felt like I was about to get tortured or something.&nbsp; She started pulling at the top of the corset.&nbsp; 
Saleslady, to my wife:&nbsp; Wow, you did a great job of tightening this, I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;ll be able to get these in.&nbsp; 
My wife volunteered to help.&nbsp; She came over and pulled out on the corset while the saleslady scrunched the globs of silicon inside.&nbsp; I felt like a mannequin.&nbsp; 
Finally the two of them managed to get them in and straighten them out.&nbsp; I looked down and was surprised to see that they looked amazingly real. They were covered in latex that was the color of skin tone.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t even see my feet over these twin peaks, I never thought that C cups were that big before, but these seemed massive.&nbsp; I could even feel the weight of them throwing my balance off a little.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Victoria:&nbsp; Hot damn they are spactacular.&nbsp; Honey, I&#8217;m not even into girls and I want to grab them.&nbsp; She squeezed at them through the corset.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Me: Okay ladies, you&#8217;ve had your fun. I turned to the saleslady.&nbsp; Please take them out.&nbsp;  It definitely sounded like a plea.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Victoria:&nbsp; Oh you wish darling.&nbsp; I think you need to understand the pain a woman goes through packing these things around all day.&nbsp;&nbsp; They&#8217;re staying in.&nbsp; The saleslady giggled again. 
 
Me, frantically whispering: And how am I going to walk around with boobs, they&#8217;ll show under my shirt. C&#8217;mon Victoria, I can&#8217;t walk around in these, this is too much, everyone will know.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Victoria:&nbsp; Nonsense, just put your jacket over the top and there&#8217;s no way anybody can tell. 
I thought she was teasing me at first, but she really wasn&#8217;t going to let me take them out.&nbsp; Son of a bitch.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I reluctantly buttoned my shirt back up.&nbsp; The top few buttons barely reached, my dress shirt was stretched tight over these big ol&#8217; jugs.&nbsp; I looked at her with my puppy dog eyes and did a silent plea.&nbsp; She just shook her head no and chuckled.&nbsp; I took my jacket and zipped it up.&nbsp; It was a little looser but you could tell that something up top was making it snug, you just couldn&#8217;t quite tell what.&nbsp; I almost had tears running down my cheeks now.&nbsp; 
Me: C&#8217;mon Victoria, this is too much, everyone will be able to tell.&nbsp; 
Her: Nonsense, it just looks like you workout a lot and have a great chest, I bet all of the guys will be asking you for tips on how you do it.&nbsp; She smiled at that one, and I wasn&#8217;t sure if she meant they were asking about my exercise routine or how I got tits.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now do you want to pay the nice lady or should we buy some more things, maybe another bra to hold up your new beautiful breasts when you&#8217;re not wearing the corset?&nbsp; 
I didn&#8217;t like the path she was going down with that comment.&nbsp; This was over as soon as we got out of this damn store.&nbsp; I handed my credit card to the saleslady.&nbsp; She put the envelope from the stockings and container for the breasts and all of the tags in a big pink store bag that said Ooh-la-la across it and handed it to me.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t even try to hand it to my wife as I knew what her response would be.&nbsp; I took it, smiled and said thanks, and turned to high tail it out of there as fast as I could.&nbsp; My wife admonished me to stand up straight so my breasts didn&#8217;t sag.&nbsp; As we walked away, I heard the saleslady and the lady behind us in line start to bust up laughing.&nbsp;
