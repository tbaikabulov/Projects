Josie's Beginning
by puppy girl
��
This was my punishment for cheating on my wife. I was always a crossdresser and really enjoyed the role-playing scenes with my wife Sarina. But I was selfish and wanted to enjoy some extra-marital affairs with other women. Sarina at first was put-off by my crossdressing but after a few years she got more and more involved. To the point that we would go out as girlfriends, or I'd be her "barbie doll" and she would pick out my clothes or decide what make-up to wear stuff like that. I noticed though after several years she was really getting into being very dominant and very bossy while I was dressed.
Sarina caught me having an affair and planned her revenge, after talking things over, I knew that financially I would be screwed. Sarina also at first threatened to tell everyone about my crossdressing, and at first I was petrified that my co-workers would find out and most of my friends. Little did I know that was the least of my problems.
Sarina was the major breadwinner in the family and told me that she would make me penniless if I didn't go along with her version of getting "even " with me.
I really thought that if I played along ,and besides I liked to play "dress-up", after a few days things would calm down, she would feel sorry for me, or vent all her anger and we could go back to the old relationship.
I didn't mind at first having to wear skirts and dresses right after I came home from work. Now I had to keep my body completely hairless, and I had to go to Holly's salon and get my brows arched. At first I thought that it would just be a little cleaning up, you know stray hairs, I kept my brows sort of unisex anyway. Well when I peered in the mirror Holly had upon Sarina'a instructions given me thin thinny brows, up in a perpetual "surprise " look and I was stuck with obviously girly brows. Then came the ear piercing. The people in my office, co-workers , work friends all starting looking at me funny. after all, pierced ears are okay for men but here I was 40 and I had 2 holes in each ear. Thin feminine eyebrows and my hair was getting longer and longer.
Then she started changing my work attire. at first it wasn't so bad . instead of men's pants, it was female trousers. Instead of a man's shirt and tie, I had to wear a women's shirt , the colors were a little more pastel. A female's thin belt was added later on in the week. The new shoes that were black loafers, or brown I had to buy at a women's shoe store, so even though they were rather unisex looking, it added a definite feminine flair to my clothes . Which were slowly looking more and more girlish. I was just an office clerk and I started to overhear people chatting about me, sort of laughing, shaking their heads. Some of the female secretaries would say comments about my earrings. Nice comments, like compliments, but I knew they were telling me that they noticed the change.
By the third week I was appalled at what Sarina laid out for me to wear. There on the door was a pair of black palazzo pants, so wide that when I put them on it looked like I had a long skirt if my legs were kept together. A matching black mock turtleneck with 3/4 sleeves. The sleeves had these huge cuffs, which only a female shirt would have. I had a pair of black pantyhose to put on and black patent leather pumps. with a 2 inch heel. Yes pumps. there was no way if you were to look at my feet that you could mistake these shoes for anything else. It was so bad not having any pockets in the pants, I had to carry a handbag. I couldn't believe this is what I had to wear to the office that day.
When I clicked into the office everyone was abuzz. After an hour of going to get coffee, having every one make up some excuse to come over to my desk to check me out, my boss called me in and sent me down to personnel.
There the woman (Sarah)who was personnel manager asked me if I was going through a sex change, I told her that I was wearing these outfits to please my wife.She sort of laughed and told me that as long as I did my work and used the appropiate bathroom there wouldn't be a problem, and thought that it was rather funny to allow myself to be dressed like this by my wife. I couldn't and wouldn't tell her that I was a crossdresser or that it was my punishment for cheating on her.
The next week my hair was permed, and cut into a female wedge .I had acrylic nails attached, given a french manicure. I had to wear hoops in my ears now.
The worst came when Sarina decided that I had to give notice and look for a job as a female. All the people at work were always giving me this smirking grins and no one would talk to me , all my friends at work were staying away as if they didn't know me. My neighbors were the same way. And when Sarina had me tell my friends when they would call that I wasn't allowed out, eventually they stopped calling
All of Sarina's friends were loving it, even her family thought that I made a nice looking female.
The day I had to give my notice , Sarina dressed me in a black short skirt, coffee colored pantyhose, white 3 inch pumps. I had a black satin top with a bra and falsies underneath and a woman's black one button jacket over the outfit. I had large hoops in both holes in each ear, my hair was curled and primped in a nice wedge female cut and of course I had to color my nails a nice medium shade of red. I had to carry a matching small white purse, and Sarina drove me to the office that day and made sure that I went in and walked pass everyone 's desk to tell everyone that I was leaving to get work as a female.I was so mortified that I didn't know what to do. When I was in the lobby Sarina took my picture and if you want to see it, just ask and she will send it out to you.
The rest of my 2 weeks was pure hell, all I had to wear was female suits, skirts, and of course the skorts, which I find very humilating, they are sort of like dress shorts, you wear them with panyhose or stockings and usually heels, they sometimes have a matching top. I have one set of skorts that I find especially humilating, they are in a tartan plaid with a matching vest, when I wear this outfit with either black or white pantyhose and heels it is very eye-catching. I've had other females stop me and tell me "what a cute outfit" "where did you get it?"
Having to work the entire 2 weeks dressed as a female and everyone knowing I was a male was the worst punishment I thought I could get. I was wrong now as I look at myself I realize that I'm just a sissy and Sarina has me as her "girlfriend " forever. My eyes are permanently outlined, my lips have a dark permanent liplines and my brows have since been removed permanently and a high , high tattooed arch has been drawn on.My ears have 6 holes in each ear, I have a set of hoops that are glued in permanently as well. I have had to endure whatever color Sarina wants my hair to be. I've had it blonded, several shades of red, frosted several times, even had it colored a dark eggplant color. My nails are now 3 inch daggers and except for my locked up penis, I have no remains that I was ever a male.
At the age of 45 I look like middle-aged woman. No beauty but with my trained squeaky voice and practiced mannerisms, I act and look like a bimbo girl.
My jobs have included being in several mall stores, working as a hostess at a restaurant and being a waitress. I even worked as a bank teller for a while, all as Josie. Most people that see me think I'm a woman, and some people ask me "how could you let someone do this to you?" It was a slow change and before I knew it I was looking more feminine than masculine. And by then I wanted to pass , not be thought of or percieved as a sissy but as a female. I fell right into Sarina's revenge.
Bye for now
