Of all the dramatic situations in clandestine prisons, nothing can compare to those family groups who were tortured, often together. Brutalizing a mother in front of her son and torturing a man in front of his wife were favorite ways of trying to make the women talk. The entire affective family world, constructed over the years with very difficulty collapses. This is a special technique of torture within the title of psychological torture, it is named &#8216;family torture&#8217;.
In much in torture centers and in police stations, women of 35 - 50 years old were questioned in presence of their young sons. This very perverse interrogation method was a method often used when the women were attractive and her son an adolescent boy.
Thes facts are taboo for the people, and is very embarrassament speak about this, in particolar for the victimes remembered this drammatic experience with pain and shame.
Interrogate a woman in presence of her son was a method often used when the women were attractive and the son adolescent.
First because, the jailers are perverse and sadistic people. 
Second because this is a terrible psychological torture: for every mother,� the fact of being naked in front of a his�son and suffer to sexual tortures is a terrible shock.
Also for the son, this experience is a big trauma, in particular when the son is adolescents in age of puberty, in this age the body boy is submitted to strong discharges of sexual hormones He sexual equilibrium it is upset when he is submitted to strong sexual stimuli and psychological traumas. 
In South America&nbsp; during the military dictatorship very people was tortured, after to be kidnapping in them house many of these persons were women.
The term detenidos-desaparecidos (detained-disappeared) more accurately describes the methodology of repression than does desaparecidos. People did not simply vanish into thin air, or leave the country without alerting their relatives, as the authorities implied. Nor were they kidnapped by fringe groups lacking any direct connection to the government. Use of the former term would directly incriminate the state, ascribing responsibility for the disappearances and reflecting what was really happening: people being detained by armed groups acting on orders from the authorities and disappearing into the night and fog of the regime.
Nobody was immune. Male and female; young and old, babies and teenagers; pregnant women, students, workers, lawyers, journalists, scientists, artists, and teachers.
In Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, very people was tortured, after to be kidnapping in them house.
Most of the people was kidnappings took place at night or at dawn-primarily in private homes, though sometimes in the streets or at workplaces- usually toward the end of the week. The timing helped delay whatever action relatives might wish to initiate. Heavily armed men dressed in civilian clothes would appear and threaten the victims and their families, and frequently their neighbors. By prior arrangement, the police would make the area near the home safe for the kidnappers. Often it would be sealed," with several cars blocking access. The number of men involved varied, from six to fifty. Private cars without license plates, or trucks or vans from the military, would take the blindfolded and handcuffed victims to a secret detention center.
The kidnappers would throw their prey on the floor of a car or into the trunk and take them in a secret detention centers located throughout the country. These centers were small houses, cellars in large buildings, auto repair plants, or military bases adapted for the purpose and complete with double barbed-wire fencing, guards with dogs, helicopter strips, and lookout towers.
Entire families, too, became targets of the repression. The gangs kidnapped whole families, including, youngsters, and adults, and often used relatives as hostages for people who were being sought.
In spring 1978, Maria S., a beautiful women of forty five years old, psychologist in Buenos Aries University, wife of a important member of opposition party, was kidnappings together of her adolescent son Pablo.
Mother and son were prisoners in �La Perla� a secret detention centre, this � the history of their tragic experience.
Maria tells: &lt;&lt; "Immediately after my arrival at La Perla I was taken to the torture room or `intense therapy' room. In the room of tortures there was my son bound and blindfold..... He was churned because could not stop they.....but he could not react.&gt;&gt;.
Remember Maria: &lt;&lt;There were 3 men and a woman in the cabinet. The woman a policewoman of 30-35 years old, a&nbsp; graduate man of forty years and two military young people contemporary of my son. Another man, someone they called the �major� were there and He had to ask the questions.&gt;&gt;
They started to question me: &lt;&lt;Is where her hunsband hides? Speak.....!&gt;&gt;
I said then: &lt;&lt;I didn&#8217;t know nothing....... Please....Please don&#8217;t touch my son he is innocent....He don&#8217;t know nothing........&gt;&gt; I was in pain and anxiety more for my son than myself.
The guard said to me: &lt;&lt;Why would a woman be drawn to the resistance? A woman should get married, and keep house. You are throwing your life away here. You even have an education. You should get married and make the best life for yourself. What have &#8216;the people&#8217; got to do with you? What does this sort of thing have to do with women? A woman is a wife and mother." One of the guards told another woman prisoner....We torture you so much to make you give this up and go back to taking care of your houses and sons&gt;&gt;.
I repeated desperate:&lt;&lt; I don&#8217;t know where is my husband &gt;&gt;. 
The �major� ordered to remove the blind, on the head of my son, in order to see my interrogation...............and began our hell.... I felt pain and fear more for my son than myself.� The maternal instinct would make me want to protect him most of all &gt;&gt; .
Maria continues:....The major gave a sign to the young guards and they started undressing me....and I was tied to prevent my reactions......My son screamed and they gagged he, in this manner he couldn&#8217;t speak but was forced to look all.....I closed the eyes for shame... 
I was forced to obey to their orders why they threatened to torture my son, they poor me in a very obscene position: naked with the legs fall open, exposing my sex to the men, and to my adolescent son....I would have preferred to die rather than to put in that position in front my son to me. I am a woman much modest, never I undressed me in presence of my son....You cannot imagine the shame that one mother tries in that situation.... I implored they to give mine me dressed.......I was motionless for fear and embarrassment while two young boys fondled my breasts, touched my vagina and verbally abused me:&lt;&lt;You are a teacher in university, you never wear panties when you teach class. You like to sit in front of the room and spread you legs, so all the boys can see you pussy and in particular you son......Look Pablo,...like you mother show her sex.....&gt;&gt;
I felt horror and shame for this obscene act in front of my son, but every reaction was impossible: my life and the life of my son, was in power of these criminals.
I remember that terrible moment. I found the strength to tell him: &lt;&lt;Please Pablo...please don't listened any of this.........We will survive&gt;&gt;. He began to cry.
Silvia Martinez Basso a woman journalist and member of important association of human rights wrote this about the technical of mother-son interrogatory: &lt;&lt;In this perverse form of questioning the woman is submitted to tortures more psychological than physics....The woman is put in front to her own son, if not already naked yet, the woman is forced to strip to assume obscene and embarrassing positions��. The interrogator puts the woman in distress: verbally abused she, fondling her breasts and her vagina. The woman, she is bound in obscene position and she is submitted to a slow and minute cavit� search (vaginal and anal), gyno exams, enemas and other forms of psychological tortures and humiliations&gt;&gt;. Continues Silvia Martinez Basso: &lt;&lt;The psychological tortures was not the only form of tortures to which to woman is submitted in presence of her adolescent son. In many cases to the psychological torture it followed that physics torture: breast tortures (breast press and breast hangings), electric shock low voltage for nipples and vagina, painbras wooden pony, caning, bastinado (caning on feet shoes), insertions of toys in vagina and anus (dildo, pump dildo, vibrator), little branding with cigarettes (breast, and soles). These physics tortures are painful but they don't provoke in the woman you damn permanent damn, because it are type to low intensity. In the cases of �family torture� the psychological torture is more effective of the physics torture&gt;&gt;.
The cavity search is very careful and slow the fingers slowly penetrate the vagina and the anus of the woman trying to stimulate the more sensitive parts of the woman the clit. the fingers push themselves in depth in order to render more painful and embarrassing the penetration.
During the perverse act a policewoman masturbate&nbsp; the boy.......All this can be defined torture. The psychological torture can be more effective than that physics.
Only a woman, in particular when she is mother can understand the shock of Maria during the cavity search......Look her face is a mask of pain and desperation.
Maria rememder: &lt;&lt; I was belted down to a wooden platform with me legs held open. 
Then dreadful thread send chills coursing down my spine. And I felt their foraging hands on my bottom� many hands at al once ��. pinching, squeezing and pressing together the buttocks �.. then spreading then apart to reveal my most private parts to my son��they said me&nbsp; &lt;&lt; Ah you&#8217;ve been shaving yourself�. What a pity ��..You must have had&gt;&gt;
Maria continuous her tragic story: - Flipping me over and spread my vaginal lips, and a men inserted his fat fingers into my opening. They amused themselves, grinning e gloating over my reactions, as. I squealed and squirmed with those fingers moving like some animals deep inside my vagina��.Mercilessly I was investigate in my intimates parts in front of my son and he was forced to watch...&gt;&gt;��During the body search a men asked me: &lt;&lt; Are you embarrassment? You child see all &gt;&gt;. I cried deprived of hope - .
