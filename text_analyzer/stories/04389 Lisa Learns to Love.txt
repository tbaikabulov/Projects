Lisa�s stomach was filled with butterflies.
She�d passed all the interviews and had finally landed the job. All that was
left was to see the personnel manager to sort out some final details. She
knocked on the door and entered the office.

&nbsp;

�Ah, Miss Jones. Welcome to Amalgamated Holdings. I�m
Christine Holmes.� The personnel officer, a smartly dressed woman in her early
thirties, stood up and came round from behind her desk. 

�Dr Andrews was most impressed with your
interview. We�re sure you�ll make a good addition to the team. You graduated
last month, I understand.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, I have my degree certificate with
me.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, that�s not necessary. We got
confirmation from your collage. This must be quite a step for you.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, I�m very excited. It�s a bit of a worry
being so far away from home but I�m sure I�ll manage.�

&nbsp;

�I wanted to talk to you about that. Have
you found anywhere to stay? I have a list of flat letting agencies if you like.
Alternatively have you thought of lodging somewhere? It�s much cheaper and can
make things easier settling in.�

&nbsp;

�I don�t know. I�m not sure what to do.�
Lisa realised that in the excitement of getting the job she�d plain forgot
about somewhere to live. And she was due to start next week. What was she to
do?

&nbsp;

�Tell you what. I know just the place for
you. Excuse me while I make a phone call.� Christine sat down again and picked
up the phone. In a few seconds she was connected.

�Judy, hi it�s Christine here. I�ve got a
young lady looking for digs. If I�m not mistaken she�s just your sort. You�ve
not got anyone at the moment have you? Can I send her round?� 

Lisa felt slightly bowled over by how
quickly her life seemed to have been taken over but the digs sounded like a
good idea and it was better than flat hunting. She had enough to organise as it
was.

After a few minutes Christine put down the
phone. �That�s settled then. Judy would love to meet you and see if you�re
compatible. Here, let me write down the address. It�s quite easy to get to by
bus. You haven�t got a car have you?�

Lisa took the bit of paper with the address
on it. Christine had also written careful instructions about bus routes and
stops so it would be easy to find. �When can I go to see her?� she asked.

&nbsp;

�Fortunately Judy, err Miss Ford, is free
this afternoon. She�s expecting you as soon as possible. Best to get these
things sorted out right away. Now off you go and we�ll see you next week.
Welcome aboard.�

&nbsp;

-----------------------------------------------------

&nbsp;

As Lisa sat on the bus she wondered what
she had let herself in for. This Miss Ford sounded like an old battle-axe.
Still she�d stay there until she found somewhere better. Finally the bus
arrived at her stop and she got off. It was not what she was expecting at all.
The area was obviously quite prosperous and when she found the house she was
surprised by how big it was. Surely someone who could afford a house like this
wouldn�t take in lodgers. She walked up to the front door and rang the bell.
When the door was answered she was in for another shock. Miss Ford wasn�t an
old battle axe at all but a slim athletic woman about the same age as Christine
Holmes. Smartly and elegantly dressed she looked like some sort of powerful
business woman, not the sort to take in lodgers at all.

&nbsp;

�Hi, you must be Lisa Jones. Do come in.
Would you like a cup of tea?� Lisa felt herself swept into the house, still to
taken aback to do anything but follow.

&nbsp;

�You must call me Judy. I can�t be doing
with too much formality. Anyway I�m sure we�ll be friends.� Judy took Lisa into
the kitchen and put the kettle on. �Christine told me something about you but
only the bare details. I gather you start with Amalgamated next week. Must be quite exciting. Now tell me all about yourself.�

&nbsp;

Lisa soon fond that she
was telling her life story to Judy. After a
slightly nervous start she relaxed and found that Judy was very easy to get on
with. Perhaps this wasn�t such a bad idea after all.

&nbsp;

�So, you�re moving down here from Manchester. That�s
quite a step. You won�t be able to get home much. How does your boyfriend feel
about that?� 

&nbsp;

�Oh, I haven�t got a boyfriend. I never
seemed to find the time, what with my degree and all.�

&nbsp;

�No boyfriend? I must admit I�ve never been
much on the male of the species myself. Well I�m sure you�ll fit in here just
fine. Here let me show you the rest of the house.�

&nbsp;

Judy took Lisa and showed her the room that
would become hers, where all the bits an pieces were
and finally took her out and showed her the garden.�

&nbsp;

�Oooh, I like this. You keep it very well,
and so private.�

&nbsp;

�Well I like my privacy. I don�t have any
rules but one I do insist on that that my private stuff is just that, private.
Do you understand?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, yes, of course.�

&nbsp;

�Well, we�ll get on just fine then. I think
we�ve covered everything. I�ll let you get back to Manchester and see
you next Sunday, moving in day. I�m sure we�re going to be very happy
together.�

&nbsp;

-----------------------------------------------------

&nbsp;

Sunday came and Lisa moved in. She found
that Judy was the perfect landlady. Indeed she was more of a friend than a
landlady and they soon started doing things together. In particular Judy jogged
every morning. Lisa joined her and they would do two circuits of the local
park. In shorts and a tight tee shirt Judy looked magnificent and Lisa found
herself staring at her in admiration. She�d never met anyone like this. So
kind, so helpful, so, dare she say it, beautiful?� She remembered feeling this way about her gym
teacher back in school. She�s never done anything about it of course but she
wondered what it meant. Why did she feel like this?

&nbsp;

One thing she soon found that was Judy went
out every Friday, punctual as clockwork. Lisa asked where she was going but
only got evasive answers. �Out. That�s all you need to
know.� Was all Judy would say. It was on a Friday then
that Lisa found herself alone in the house. There was nothing to watch on the
television and she was bored. She moped around for a while and then began to
look at the books in the book case. Tucked away on the top shelf was a photo album.
She remembered Judy�s request for privacy but if it was out on the bookcase
surely it wouldn�t hurt to look. She got it down and lay
it out on the coffee table.

&nbsp;

As she turned the pages Lisa cold hardly
believe what she was looking at. It was full of photos, mostly Polaroid�s, of
young women. Some were dressed as maids, some in school uniform, some wearing
nothing except leather straps that looked like a horses
bridal but each picture kept to the general theme. All the women were being
punished, or something like it. It wasn�t just that
canes and paddles featured heavily but the women being punished were all in
totally humiliating positions. One picture in particular caught her eye. A
young woman, not much older than herself was dressed up as a maid. However she
was shown from behind, bent over, her skirt pulled up around her waist and her
panties down around her ankles. She was bent so far over that she was clearly
showing her most private parts and, to cap it all, there were a series of red
stripes across her bottom. It took little imagination to see that she had been
caned, and quite severely. But the bit that got to Lisa most of all was that
she was looking back so her face was quite visible. Instead of the tears, or a
grimace that Lisa would have suspected she had the biggest grin on her face.
She may be bent over in the most humiliating position, she may have been caned,
but she was obviously enjoying herself.

&nbsp;

Lisa flicked through the rest of the album.
Some of the women were performing the most degrading acts, all were posed so
that they had no dignity, showing their all, but many were smiling and all
seemed to be there by choice. Some of the photos showed the women giving the
punishment. She recognised Judy in many of the shots. Sometimes
holding a cane, sometimes a paddle, and sometimes objects that Lisa couldn�t
recognise. In each case her dress matched the pose. If the punished were
dressed as a schoolgirl then the punisher would be dressed most severely, as if
she were a strict teacher. If the punished were dressed as a maid the punisher
would be dressed as a Victorian lady.�
There was obvious attention to detail.

&nbsp;

Lisa realised that Judy would be home soon.
She pushed the album back where it belonged and hurried off to bed. As she lay
between the sheets her mind whirled. Part of her wondered �How could they? How
could anyone allow herself to be trussed, tied, beaten, and, above all, exposed
in that way. She�d be mortified to let anyone see her
like that, let alone take photographs. On the other hand part of her, part she
hardly dared admit to, was strongly aroused. She tossed and turned and was
still wide awake when she heard Judy come home. Part of her wanted to ask Judy
about the photos but that would be admitting that she�s pried. No wonder Judy
was so secretive about her private life.

&nbsp;

The hours dragged by. Lisa still couldn�t
sleep and she heard Judy taking herself off to bed. The images swirled before
her mind, in particular the picture of the maid bent over. She realised if she
was going to get some sleep she would have to sneak back for another look.
Moving quietly as she could she crept downstairs and
into the lounge. She got out the album and searched for the picture.� It was still as disturbing, as alluring as it
had been earlier. Almost without thinking about it her hand slid down the front
of her pyjama bottoms. As she stared at the picture wondering what it would be
like to be that woman, to be bent over and exposed like that, she started to
play with herself. In her mind she could hear the swish of the cane. It must
have hurt to make stripes that red, that vivid. Her hand rubbed harder and
faster at her crutch. Her breathing was fast and shallow. She could feel
herself starting to come. How could a picture affect her like this?

&nbsp;

�And what do you think you�re doing.�
Judy�s voice, stern and hard, jerked Lisa from her reverie. She jerked her hand
from her pyjamas but nothing could hide the damp patch between her legs. Judy
stood at the door wearing a dressing gown.

&nbsp;

�I� I� I was just�� Lisa stuttered.

&nbsp;

�I can see what you were just�� Judy
snapped back. �I told you my private life is private and now I find you
snooping around. Well?�

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry, I didn�t mean to pry.�

&nbsp;

�You didn�t mean to pry? What do you call
this?� Judy seemed quite angry. �I�m not sure I want to share my home with a
little sneak like you. What do you say?�

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry, I�m really sorry. Please I�d
like to stay. I really would.�

&nbsp;

There was a long pause. Judy seemed to
study Lisa, her eyes resting on the damp patch between her thighs. Eventually
she spoke.

&nbsp;

�Well, as you can see, I have my own way of
dealing with naughty little girls. Maybe a good spanking would teach you some
manners. Well?�

&nbsp;

Lisa�s mind whirled. She really wanted to
stay and she had been a naughty little girl. Maybe she did deserve to be
punished. But� But�

&nbsp;

�Well?� Judy asked again. �Speak up. What
do you have to say for yourself?�

&nbsp;

Judy�s sharp tone seemed to take control of
Lisa. Se felt disturbed and aroused. She knew she should turn and run but
something made her stay.

&nbsp;

�Yes, I�ve been a naughty girl and deserve
to be spanked.� Lisa felt as if she were in a dream. The words seemed winched
out of her. She stared at the floor unable to meet Judy�s eyes.

&nbsp;

�Right then, at the bottom of my wardrobe
you�ll find a brown holdall. Go and get it. Quickly now.
And while you�re being punished you address me as �Miss�, do you understand?�

&nbsp;

�Yes Miss.� Lisa hurried off and fetched
the bag. It was heavier than it looked and clinked ominously.� When she returned Judy had positioned an
upright chair in the middle of the room. 

&nbsp;

�Put the bag down next to the chair and
stand there.� Judy indicated that Lisa should stand in front of the chair and
sat down. She reached into the bag and brought out a short leather strap with a
wooden handle. �I think this will do.� She looked up at Lisa.

&nbsp;

�Yes Miss.�

&nbsp;

�You�ve been a naughty little girl and you
deserve to punished. Don�t you?�

&nbsp;

�Yes Miss.�

&nbsp;

�Now I�m going to spank you for being
naughty. If you plead for me to stop I�ll ignore it but if you say strawberry
then I�ll stop immediately. Do you understand?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss. Strawberry
Miss.�

&nbsp;

�Very good.� Now drop you pyjama bottoms.
Come on, around your ankles. Quickly girl.�

&nbsp;

Judy�s voice was stern and sharp and
demanded obedience. Lisa nervously slid her fingers under the elastic of the
waistband and started to push her pyjama bottoms down.

&nbsp;

�Come along, we haven�t got all night. It�s
late enough as it is.� Judy prompted. Lisa realised she was committed now and
pushed the waistband down. As it cleared her hips the pyjama bottoms fell to
her ankles. She stood up straight again she glanced at Judy who had a curiously
satisfied smile on her face. There was a pause as Judy looked her over,
studying her. Lisa blushed in embarrassment.

&nbsp;

�Well may you blush young lady. There�s no
dignity for naughty little girls like you. Now get over my knee.�

&nbsp;

Lisa positioned herself across Judy�s knee.
Judy grabbed her wrist and turned it behind her back holding her firmly in
place. Her other hand reached down to Lisa�s buttocks and began to stroke them.


&nbsp;

�Move you legs apart.� Judy pushed at Lisa
thigh. Lisa had to wriggle her feet out of her pyjama bottoms so that she could
comply.� �That�s better.�

&nbsp;

Judy�s hand returned to it�s stroking but
this time she delved deeper between her thighs. Lisa realised that any moment
Judy would find out how aroused she�d been, how damp she still was. She cringed
with embarrassment as Judy�s fingers reached her lips and pushed inside her.

&nbsp;

�Well, well, well. Who�s a randy one then. Seems like my pictures got you quite turned on, didn�t
they?� Judy�s fingers reached Lisa�s clitoris and began to stroke it.

&nbsp;

�Yes Miss.� Lisa whispered.

&nbsp;

�What was that? Speak up.�

&nbsp;

�Yes Miss.�

&nbsp;

�Yes Miss what?� Judy demanded.

&nbsp;

�Yes Miss, your pictures turned me on.�
Lisa was horrified by what she was admitting but Judy�s finger was pushing her
right back toward her orgasm. Suddenly it withdrew. There was a short pause and
thwack, the strap landed across her buttocks. Lisa cried out in pain and tried
to wiggle free but she was too firmly held in place. Besides, she deserved to
be punished, she�d been a naughty girl. Along with the
pain there was another deeper sensation that went straight to her groin.
Thwack, thwack, thwack. Judy kept up a steady rhythm. As Lisa squirmed and struggled her mons rubbed against the rough towelling of
Judy�s dressing gown arousing her further. Despite the pain, because of the
pain she felt waves of pleasure coursing through her. Each one higher, more
intense, more powerful until, until, until��


&nbsp;

As Lisa climaxed she bucked off Judy�s knee
and fell to the floor. She lay there sobbing, exhausted. She�d never felt
anything so powerful, so all consuming. She�d never climaxed like that before
and it took her a few minutes to get her breath back. Meanwhile Judy had
crouched down beside her and was cuddling her gently. Finally Lisa sat up and
reached for Judy. 

&nbsp;

�That was fantastic. Thank you, thank you.�
She reached out her arms and gave Judy a hug. �How can I thank you properly?�
she asked.

&nbsp;

�Come on. It�s late. Come back to my bed
and I�ll show you.�

&nbsp;

Judy took her by the hand and led her off
upstairs.




Lisa rolled over after a long satisfying
sleep. It was Saturday morning and she could lie in. As she came too she
realised that the bed was too wide and then it all came back. She was in Judy�s
bed. She�d never meant to� She let out a horrified gasp as full recollection
came back. She�d behaved like a shameless slut! Judy wasn�t there beside her
now but she�d surely be back soon. She looked for her pyjamas. The top lay on
the floor beside the bed. She blushed again when she remembered where the
bottoms were. Back in the lounge where she�d� Perhaps
if she snuck out now she�d be able to see Judy later and explain that it had
all been a big mistake. She wasn�t that sort of girl, honest she wasn�t. She
was reaching down for her pyjama top when the door opened. Judy entered wearing
a satin dressing gown and holding a loaded tray.

&nbsp;

�Good morning. I�ve brought tea and toast.�

&nbsp;

Lisa slipped back under the covers holding
them high to cover herself up.

&nbsp;

�A little more modest this morning, are
we?� Judy�s tone was half mocking.

&nbsp;

�I� Err� About last
night.� Lisa stammered.

&nbsp;

Judy put the tea tray down and reached over
touching Lisa�s lips with her finger as if to shush her.

&nbsp;

�You look a little worried. Let me guess.
It goes something like this. You�ve never done anything like last night before.
You�re not sure you want to do anything like it ever again and you�re worried
about how this puts things between the two of us. But before you run away just
remember how good it felt. I know you weren�t faking that bit! Here, put your
pyjama top back on if it helps you feel more comfortable and stay and have
breakfast with me. It would be a shame to let it go to waste.�

&nbsp;

Lisa took the pyjama to from Judy and
snuggled under the covers to put it on. Reluctantly she agreed that she might
as well stay for breakfast.

&nbsp;

As the two women ate their toast Lisa
turned to Judy and asked �How did you know how I felt? I mean, you were spot
on. Look, I don�t want to be a wet blanket or anything but I�m really not sure
about all this. I�m not sure it�s right, right for me I mean.�

&nbsp;

�Good heavens girl, do you thing you�re the
only one to be nervous after her first time!� Judy laughed. �Why, after my
first time I had all the same doubts. �Oh my God! I�m a lesbian pervert� or
something like that.�

&nbsp;

Lisa had never thought that the suave,
self-assured and confident Judy could be like that. The thought intrigued her.

&nbsp;

�Your first time? What was it like? We�re you seduced by the older woman like me?�

&nbsp;

�No, nothing like that,
and less of the �older� thank you. No, it was
completely different.�

&nbsp;

�Please tell me, I�d love to know.� Lisa�s
curiosity had overcome her nerves.

�Well, it was some time ago. I was fresh up
at collage when I met Christine. She and I just sparked. You know how it goes
sometimes. You meet someone and instantly get on. She and I just bonded. Nothing sexy at first, just good friends.

&nbsp;

�Anyway she invited me down to spend the
summer holidays with her at her family�s farm down in Devon. I couldn�t resist an
offer like that so I went down to join her. It�s a lovely place. Right out in
the country. Lots of fresh air and open spaces. I had
a great time.

&nbsp;

�One day her family all went off for market
day. We girls stayed behind to look after the house and work on our tans. We
decided to have a picnic out on the lawn so we got in our bikinis and took some
food, and more importantly a bottle of chilled white wine out into the garden.
After lunch the wine and the hot sun had made me drowsy but it had the opposite
effect on Christine. She got quite playful and started to mess around. I didn�t
mind at first but I just wanted to relax and read my book so it was beginning
to get on my nerves.

&nbsp;

�After a while she disappeared for a bit.
The next thing I knew a stream of ice-cold water broke over me soaking me and
my book. Christine was standing there with a hose. I jumped up to grab the hose
off her and the whole thing developed into a bit of a struggle. I wanted to get
the hose off her she wouldn�t let go. It was all friendly and laughing but
either of us wanted to lose.

&nbsp;

�Eventually I got her face down on the
ground with me sitting astride her. I spotted one of the flip-flops we�d been
wearing and a sudden impulse got into me. �If you�re going to behave like a
little child I�m going to treat you like a little child.� I told her. �A good
spanking is what you deserve.� 

&nbsp;

�I grabbed the flip-flop and stated to
spank her.� This awoke some devil inside
me and I started quite hard. It really must have hurt. After half a dozen
strokes or so I started to get worried about the squeaks of pain that Christine
was making so I stopped. I could not have been more surprised when Christine
called out �Please, please don�t stop. That�s fantastic!�

&nbsp;

��Well little madam. If that�s what you�re like then we�d better do it properly� I
replied. I grabbed her bikini bottoms and pulled them down. Her bottom was
already covered in red marks and I stroked them gently. Then I set to with a
vengeance. Christine wriggled her arm beneath her and, to my amazement started
to play with herself. The more I smacked her the more harder
she rubbed herself and I was getting turned on too. It didn�t take long before
she cried out and came with the strongest orgasm I�d ever seen at that point in
my life. I stopped smacking her and she rolled over and pulled me down to her.
�Thank you, thank you, thank you� she repeated between deep passionate kisses.
�Now, I�ve had my orgasm, what about yours?�

&nbsp;

�Gently she rolled me over onto my back and
started to kiss not just my lips but my neck, my shoulders, anywhere she could
get at. She took of my bikini top and kissed my nipples. I�d never felt
anything like it. Sure a few tentative boyfriends had had a go but what do men
know? All this, the sun and the wine was have a powerful effect on me and I
took her head in my hands and pushed it down to my groin. Christine needed no
further prompting and she removed my bikini bottoms and started to kiss between
my thighs. It was like turning an electric switch. Within seconds I knew I was
about to have the most powerful orgasm I had ever had. Her tongue lapped at my
clitoris pushing me higher and higher. Moments later I came with a shout that
must have been heard in the next county. I pulled her back up to me face to
face and in one long cuddle we drifted off to sleep together in each other�s
arms.

&nbsp;

��Fortunately we didn�t sleep too deeply so
we were woken by the sounds of the rest of the family returning. We threw on
some clothes and tried to pretend nothing had happened. Luckily Christine had a
wrap nearby. Her bikini wouldn�t have covered the marks on her bottom even if
it had been on her! It was quite an act keeping a straight face when her family
came into the garden looking for us. We�d managed to get decent by then, but
only just.

&nbsp;

�Well, we didn�t get any time in the rest
of the day to talk privately but it was quite common for Christine and I to sneak into each others rooms at night and share a bed.
Nobody thought anything of it, assuming correctly that we were just chatting.
That night I knew all the uncertainties you�re feeling now. What would I say to
Christine? We�d been a bit drunk at the time. How was it going to be now we�d
sobered up? How was this going to affect our friendship? Where did she want to
take this? Where did I want to take this? I�m sure you know what I�m talking
about.

&nbsp;

�Anyway when she came to my room that night
it turned out she was as apprehensive as I was. We talked and talked late into
the night about how we felt and what we wanted. And at the end of the day what
we decided was �So what? She had had fun. I had had
fun. No one got hurt, at least not more than they wanted to and we�d both had
the best, most powerful orgasms ever.��

&nbsp;

�Wow. That�s fantastic And
what happened next?� Lisa asked Her eyes were right with excitement..� �Did you keep
playing together?� 

&nbsp;

�Of course. Christine and I spent the rest of that summer, and a whole lot more
besides experimenting with what we liked, what turned each other on.�

&nbsp;

�And do you still see her? Is she still you
friend?�

&nbsp;

�Well, we�ve drifted apart a bit. She goes
her way and I go mine but we�re still very much in touch. You�ve met her you
know. She�s head of personnel at Amalgamated.�

&nbsp;

�Christine Holmes! She�s your Christine!�

&nbsp;

�Oh yes, and we still play together from
time to time. Anyway, enough about me, what about you?�

&nbsp;

�What about me?� Lisa asked a bit
nervously.

&nbsp;

�Well, if I�m any judge, and I am,
someone�s got a bit worked up by my little story. Let me see� Judy�s voice had
regained its authoritative tone. Gently she pushed Lisa back onto the pillows.
Her hand slid beneath the covers and started to move down Lisa�s body. When her
hand reached the bottom of her pyjama top she slid it over Lisa�s thigh and
into her crotch. 

�Well Miss I�m Not Sure. Looks like I
really got to you.� Lisa felt Judy�s fingers slip inside her. There was no
hiding how damp she was. Lisa struggled with indecision. She still wasn�t sure
how far she wanted to go with this but Judy�s hand on her groin was giving her
delicious tingles.

&nbsp;

Judy pulled her and away and sat up. �I
know what you need.� She said and she undid the belt of her dressing gown and
slipped it from the loops that held it around her waist.

&nbsp;

�Put you hands together over your head.�
Lisa obeyed reluctantly wondering what was coming next. Judy quickly looped the
dressing gown belt around her wrists and tied them together. The smooth
material was tight enough to hold her but not tight enough to hurt. She tied
the other end off to the headboard. 

&nbsp;

�Now then, you just lie there and I�ll make
the decisions for a while.� Judy pulled back the covers so Lisa lay exposed.
Then she knelt over Lisa and started undoing the buttons of her pyjama top.
�That�s better. You�ve got lovely breasts. You shouldn�t hide them away. Judy
lent forward and kissed Lisa�s nipples. Lisa felt strangely comforted by having
her hands tied. After all, if she couldn�t escape then she wasn�t really
agreeing to what was happening. Judy had started to use her teeth on Lisa�s
nipples. As she bit harder and harder it started to hurt, not much but enough.
Each bite seemed to send a tingling shock straight to her groin. Suddenly Judy
bit much harder. Lisa groaned and arched her back as a wave of pain and
pleasure washed through her. Judy sat back with a look on her face like the cat
that�s stolen the cream.

&nbsp;

�Please, please don�t stop.� Lisa begged. 

&nbsp;

�Now now. I told you. I make the decisions. I don�t want another word from
you young lady. If you speak again I�ll have to gag you.� Judy returned to her
work kissing Lisa�s stomach, her hips, the top of her thighs. Lisa�s groin
ached to be touched. She was so close, so near and yet so far. Judy�s kisses
continued to circle in towards the centre of Lisa�s pleasure until finally,
with one brief kiss, her lips brushed the top of Lisa�s slit and she sat back
again.

&nbsp;

�Ooohhh.� Lisa couldn�t keep back the groan of frustrated pleasure. She
needed release and had been so close.

&nbsp;

�I told you, one more word and I�d gag
you.� Judy got off the bed and searched around for a moment. When she returned
she was holding a pair of panties and a headscarf.

&nbsp;

�Open wide.� Lisa was far too far gone to do anything but obey. Judy pushed the
panties into her mouth and tied the headscarf around her head to hold them in.
Once again she set to work, once again she played with Lisa�s body but every
time Lisa came close to orgasm she draw back. Lisa�s body screamed with
frustration. She tried to roll over, to rub herself against Judy, anything for
relief. Judy firmly pushed her back.

&nbsp;

�You come when I say you come. Understand?�
Judy got off the bed and went to the door. �Just lie there a second. Don�t go
anywhere.�

&nbsp;

Minutes later she returned with the holdall
that had been left in the lounge the night before. She laid it on the floor and
rummaged around for a bit, took out a few things and put them on the bed.� Then she got back on the bed herself.� Judy picked up a short length of chain with a
clip at either end. She knelt beside Lisa�s body and attached each of the clips
to a nipple. They were quite tight and the caused a throbbing sensation. If
Lisa hadn�t been so turned on they would have hurt but in her present state
they just added to the overall sensations. Judy played gently with the chain,
tugging it to increase the sensations, to increase the pain. Lisa felt as if
she would explode. Even with the gag she was pleading for release, her voice
muffled and distorted. Judy reached down to the pile of things on the bed. Now
she held a large vibrator. Lisa looked on with horror. Something that big would
never fit inside her! However Judy wasn�t going to do that, she switched it on
and started stoking it against Lisa�s lower lips. The throbbing from her
nipples and the buzz of the vibrator combined in Lisa�s body to build in wave
after wave of feeling, of pain, of pleasure, of� Lisa started to come. Again
and again she climaxed but each time Judy wouldn�t let her finish. Each time
Judy kept pushing her to one more wave until finally Lisa cried out as loud as
the gag would allow, arched her back and pushed herself away, as far as her
tied wrists would let her.

&nbsp;

Lisa was still sobbing with emotion as Judy
unclipped the nipple clamps, switched off the vibrator and untied Lisa�s wrists.
Then she took the girl in her arms and held her close.

&nbsp;

�Still unsure about what you like?� Judy�s
tone was mocking.

&nbsp;

�Wow, that was
fantastic!� Lisa was still breathless. �But what about you.
What can I do for you in return?�

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry little one. I�ll get my
pleasure later. Why don�t you agree to be my little slave this afternoon?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, anything, anything
after that.� Lisa replied and snuggled back into
Judy�s arms.

&nbsp;

�Gotcha!� Judy thought to herself.




In a warm post coital glow Lisa lay cuddled
in the crook of Judy�s arm. Whilst she still had doubts about what she was
doing she felt safe here. Judy was strong, self assured and confident. So different from her. Absentmindedly she ran her hand over
Judy�s stomach. She loved the feel of it. Judy�s jogging and sessions in the
gym had left her body firm and lean. She really was very beautiful. Her hand
edged lower, just brushing the top of Judy�s pubic hair. She kept it short and
neat, not shaven, more like a crew cut. She snuggled in closer.

&nbsp;

�Ummm. That�s nice. Judy purred. �But we can�t lie here all day. We have
things to do. I need to go into town to shop. Do you want to come too?�

&nbsp;

�Yes please. That would be fun.�

&nbsp;

�Come and join me in the shower and then
we�ll get dressed and go.� Judy got out of bed, shrugged off her dressing gown
and headed for the en-suite.

&nbsp;

Lisa hadn�t shared a shower with anyone
since games days at school. She was a little nervous and unsure of what was
expected of her. She tried to keep herself as far away from Judy as possible.
Judy had other ideas. �Here, let me help you with that.� Judy took the soap and
started to work up a rich lather all over Lisa�s body. Standing face-to-face
Judy wrapped her arms around her and held her close as he worked on Lisa�s back
�You�ve got a lovely little body, you know.� She said as s soaped into the
crack of Lisa�s buttock. �You really should show it off more.�

&nbsp;

Lisa didn�t think she had a lovely body at
all. When she looked in the mirror all she saw was this skinny little thing.
And now Judy was saying she was what? Pretty? �It�s not as nice as yours.� She
murmured as she nestled her head into Judy�s shoulder. The hot water, the soap
and the feel of Judy�s body held close to her were turning her on again.
Lightly she kissed Judy�s neck.

&nbsp;

�No time for that now.� Judy laughed. �Come
on, rinse the soap off. It�s time to get dressed and go.�

&nbsp;

They got out of the shower. Judy handed
Lisa a towel, took one for herself, and they went back into the bedroom. As
Lisa dried herself off Judy wrapped her towel around herself, turned to her
dressing table and rummaged in a draw. Finding what she wanted she turned back
to Lisa.

&nbsp;

�Right young lady. You remember your promise about later?� Judy asked.

&nbsp;

�Er� yes� Lisa replied nervously.

&nbsp;

�Well here�s something to make sure you
don�t forget. Take off that towel, come over here and stand in front of me.�
Judy sat on the stool by her dressing table as Lisa obeyed. Judy produced a
length of golden chain. At one end was a small padlock, at the other a heart
shaped medallion with �Judy� inscribed on it. She passed the chain around
Lisa�s waist and, after a few adjustments clicked the padlock shut. The
medallion was quite heavy and the chain was adjusted so that it nestled just at
the top of Lisa�s labia. Lisa could see that with every movement it would bump
against her, not hard, but enough to know it was there. Judy took the medallion
and pointed out the inscription to Lisa.

&nbsp;

�That�s to remind you just whose property
you are at the moment. Right, off you go and get dressed. I want to leave in
ten minutes. When you�re wearing the chain wear a dress or a skirt, no jeans.
Oh, and no bra or panties either. I�ll be checking!�

&nbsp;

Lisa looked at herself in the mirror. The
medallion nestled in her pubic hair. She was taken by how pretty it looked but
the work �property� echoed in her mind. It wasn�t just the physical chain and
how, or more importantly, where it lay against her. She felt like she�d been
tagged, or possibly gift-wrapped.

&nbsp;

�Come along. Stop admiring yourself. We haven�t
got all day.� Judy told her.

&nbsp;

Lisa hurried back to her room. It was a
bright sunny day so she chose a loose summery dress in light cotton. She felt a
bit exposed; naked under her dress, but a quick check in the mirror confirmed
that it didn�t show. No panties implied no tights
either so she chose short white socks and �sensible� shoes. She went downstairs
and a few minutes later Judy joined her. As ever Judy was a picture of smart
elegance. Lisa felt the difference in their dress emphasised the difference
between them. She felt young and vulnerable, almost grateful for Judy�s
protection.

&nbsp;

As they walked round town hand in hand Lisa
could feel the medallion bumping against her. As it swung forward it would hit
the material of the dress and she wondered if anyone would notice. The cool
breeze around her legs seemed to emphasise her nakedness underneath. She began
to realise the subtleness of what Judy had done to her. Here they were having a
perfectly normal Saturday morning shop but she was kept constantly aware of how
she was dressed and what was to come. This, combined with the bumping of the
medallion, was keeping her lightly aroused. 

&nbsp;

At noon they stopped off at a wine
bar for lunch. Judy chose a quiet corner where they would not be disturbed.
They had hardly sat down, and were still awaiting a waitress to order when�

�Hello Judy, Lisa. How are you? Do you mind
if I join you?� Christine Holmes appeared at their table.

&nbsp;

�Of course not. Pull up a chair.� Judy replied. The waitress arrived and the three
women ordered.

&nbsp;

�So, how are you two getting on?� Christine
asked. �When I found out that Lisa her was looking for digs I thought of you
right away. Was I right or was I right?�

&nbsp;

�Oh were just fine.� Judy replied. �Getting on like a house on fire. Lisa and I are having so
much fun together.�

&nbsp;

�Really?� There was a questioning tone in Christine�s voice.

&nbsp;

�Oh yes. As a matter of fact she�s chained
right now.�

&nbsp;

�Judy!� Lisa was horrified, her face
burning with embarrassment. How could she betray her like this?

&nbsp;

�Now, now dear.� Judy�s tone was firm. �I told you about me and Christine. It�s only
fair that she should know in return.�

&nbsp;

�Chained? Right now?�
Christine had a wicked grin on her face.

&nbsp;

�Oh yes, why don�t you have a feel?� Judy
slipped her arm around Lisa in what looked to the outside world as a friendly
hug. In fact she was holding her quite tightly. Christine shuffled her chair a
little closer and slipped her hand under Lisa�s dress. Fortunately the
tablecloth hid her actions from the rest of the wine bar.

&nbsp;

�Legs apart dear.� Judy whispered in Lisa�s ear. Christine�s hand slipped between her
thighs and found the medallion. In a sitting position it rested much lower,
touching the chair Lisa was sitting on. Christine�s fingers took hold of it,
rubbed it gently up and down Lisa�s labia and then slipped it inside. Lisa
gasped in surprise.

&nbsp;

�Oh yes, she�s really quite wet and
excited. How long has this been going on?� To Lisa�s relief Christine removed
her hand. She licked the tips of her fingers. �She�s quite the horny one.�

&nbsp;

�Just since last night. I caught her peeping at the photo albums, gave her a sound spanking
and we�re taking it from there.�

&nbsp;

Lisa was appalled by what had just
happened. Judy had offered her up without so much as a by your leave and Christine,
without a moments hesitation had touched her in the most intimate way possible.
She felt as if she were a new toy being shared by the two women but she
couldn�t make a fuss without making a scene in this very public place. Part of
her was appalled by herself. Christine was right. She was aroused and
the medallion, still resting inside her, was not making things any easier. The
chain was pulled against her clitoris. She urgently needed to� to do what? Pull
it out was the obvious answer but she couldn�t resist the thrills running
through her. If only she could just touch herself. She moved her hand down to
her lap. Maybe she could reach the chain through the light cotton of her dress.


&nbsp;

�No.� Judy took her wrist and pulled her
hand away. �I can guess what Christine did. Leave it there.� The three women
pulled apart as the waitress arrived with their food and drinks.

&nbsp;

When the waitress left Christine took a
long drink from her wine. �So, if Lisa here is chained it looks like it�s playtime tonight.�

&nbsp;

�Yes indeed. Would you like to join us?�
Judy didn�t so much as glance at Lisa for confirmation
that this would be all right with her.

&nbsp;

�I�d love to, I�ve nothing on tonight, or
nothing I can�t cancel.�

&nbsp;

�Come round for supper then. Seven for
seven thirty OK?�

&nbsp;

�I wouldn�t miss it for the world.�

&nbsp;

�But� But�� Lisa stammered.

&nbsp;

�Later dear. We�ll sort it out later.� Once again Judy�s tone brooked no
argument. It was obvious that as far as she was concerned the matter was
settled.

&nbsp;

For the rest of the meal Judy and Christine
chatted idly. Lisa tried to join in but she found it difficult to concentrate.
The tingling from between her thighs mixed with her nervousness about what was
planned for this evening was making her mind reel.

&nbsp;

Finally the meal was over.� �Right, I must be off. I�ll see you later.�
Christine said as she got up from the table. As Lisa got up she felt the chain
tug the medallion from inside her. She told Judy that she had to nip to the
toilet.

&nbsp;

�Right. I�ll come with you. I want to make sure you don�t play with
yourself in there. That�s against the rules.�

&nbsp;

�Rules, what rules?�

&nbsp;

�My rules. Now off we go.�

&nbsp;

When the two women reached the toilet stall
Lisa blurted out �Why? Why did you invite her without asking me? Don�t I get a
say in the matter.�

&nbsp;

�Keep your voice down.� Judy replied
sharply. �Someone might come in at any moment. Let�s keep this private.�

&nbsp;

�Private! You�ve just invited someone I
hardly know to come and see me� and see me�� Lisa couldn�t bring herself to say
the words. Furthermore she wasn�t quite sure exactly what Christine had been
invited to come and see.

&nbsp;

�Look, normally of course I�d check with
you but when you�re my slave I make the decisions. The slave�s
job is just to obey and disobedience will be punished.�

&nbsp;

�I don�t know. I�m not sure about this.�

&nbsp;

Judy�s tone softened. �Look, I know this is
all a bit much but why don�t you trust me a bit. You know I won�t hurt you,
well, not more than you deserve. Use the stop word if you must but I promise
you if you trust me you�ll find out just how much fun we can have.�

&nbsp;

Lisa thought it over. She could feel her
resistance slipping away. The turmoil in her mind was being overcome by the
itch in her groin and also, truth be told, by a growing curiosity. Guided by
Judy she had just had two of the most fantastic sexual experiences ever. What
more was to come? Furthermore she was getting fond of Judy. She didn�t want to
ruin their relationship by being a prude. Maybe she�d try it just this once. As
Judy had said she could always use the stop word.

&nbsp;

�Come on now, if you came in here to pee
then pee. We�ve got shopping to do.�

&nbsp;

�What? In front of you?�

&nbsp;

�Yes little one.� Judy laughed. �I like to
watch.�

&nbsp;

Somehow peeing in front of Judy was more
intimate, more exposing than all the sex they had shared together. However Lisa
realised she had to get used to the new regime. She pulled her dress up, sat
down on the toilet, moved the medallion to one side and started to pee.

&nbsp;

As Judy watched she smiled to herself. The
�accidental� meeting with Christine had been no accident! A quick phone call
while Lisa was getting dressed was all it had needed. Christine had played her
part perfectly. She had been a bit concerned about moving Lisa on to the next
step so quickly but her choice of a public place had been spot on. She knew
Lisa was well hooked now but she still had to tread a little carefully or she�d
frighten her off and lose her. And with Lisa she felt it wasn�t just another
notch on the bedpost. She was genuinely fond of the girl. Even before last
night she had enjoyed having Lisa around. If they were as compatible as she
thought then there could be great times ahead.




On the drive home Lisa was a quiet and
thoughtful. Judy glanced across.

&nbsp;

�A penny for your
thoughts.� She asked.

&nbsp;

�Judy.� Lisa sounded uncertain. �Is it
always going to be like this?�

&nbsp;

�How do you mean?�

&nbsp;

�I don�t mind being your slave today, well I don�t think I do, but what about tomorrow? Can
we just be Judy and Lisa again?�

&nbsp;

�Of course we can. There are some people
who are always in role but I�m not one of them. Let�s just let tonight take its
course and tomorrow we�ll be Judy and Lisa again. When we�re in play mode we�re
in play mode, when we�re not we�re not. OK?�

&nbsp;

�Yes.� Lisa sounded relieved. �I mean I
want to do this, I really do, but not all the time.�

&nbsp;

�I understand.� Judy realised that Lisa was
reassuring herself more than anything else. �Here we are, back home. Get the
bags out of the car and come up to my room. We�ll sort out the next bit.

&nbsp;

Lisa did as she was told. When she arrived
at Judy�s room Judy was searching around in the back of her wardrobe.

&nbsp;

�Now then.� She said turning to Lisa. �I seem to remember that it was a photo
of Sally as a maid that got you so turned on last night so a maid you shall be.
I haven�t got all the bits so we will have to extemporise.�

&nbsp;

She laid out on the bed a full-length
cotton apron with frilled edges. After a few more minutes searching she found
some old fashioned bloomers, a starched mop cap and an old fashioned corset.
She gathered them together. �Now, off to your room and we�ll see what we can
find.�

&nbsp;

Judy rummaged through Lisa�s wardrobe and
picked out a plain black skirt and white short-sleeved blouse. �These will have
to do. Now let�s get you in uniform. Off with that dress young lady.�

&nbsp;

Lisa obeyed and Judy picked up the corset
and held it against her body. It reached from her hips to just below her
breasts. �Hmm. Not quite your size but there�s enough
lacing to make up for that.� At first the corset seemed quite loose but as Judy
pulled at the laces it got tighter and tighter. Not only was her waist pulled
in but she was forced to stand straighter. Judy tied off the laces and reached
for the bloomers. These were very old fashioned, no elastic but ribbons that
tied off around the waist and above the knees. They were baggy enough not to
restrict the medallion in any way. The skirt, blouse, apron and cap completed
the ensemble.

&nbsp;

Judy stood back, looked her up and down and
sighed. �Well it�s far from perfect but it will have to do for now. There�s
plenty of housework for you to be getting on with. Off you go.�

�Ok� Lisa replied.

&nbsp;

�I beg your pardon Jones. What did you just
say?� Judy�s voice was sharp and firm.

&nbsp;

�Sorry Miss. I forgot.�

&nbsp;

�You forgot? I�ll make sure you never
forget. I demand that you show proper respect at all times. Is
that understood?�

&nbsp;

�Yes Miss. I�m sorry Miss.�

&nbsp;

�That�s better but I prefer Ma�am from my
maids.�

&nbsp;

�Yes Ma�am. Of course
Ma�am.� Lisa hung her head. She felt like a little schoolgirl being told
of by a strict teacher.

&nbsp;

�Well get on with your chores then. Off you
go.�

&nbsp;

As Lisa got on with the housework Judy sat
in the lounge and read a magazine, pointedly ignoring her. The tight corset
restricted her movements and was a constant reminder of her position. As she
polished the big mirror above the fireplace she looked at her reflection. The
cap and apron marked her as quite the little maid at the beck and call of her
mistress. Why did she find it so erotic?

&nbsp;

�Jones! It�s four
 thirty. Where�s my afternoon tea?�

&nbsp;

�Coming Ma�am. I�ll be right there.� Lisa rushed to the kitchen and put on the
kettle. She knew she�d be in more trouble if she didn�t get this right. It
couldn�t be just a cup of tea. Hurriedly she put together a tray with teapot,
cup, saucer and a plate of biscuits to round it off.

&nbsp;

As she brought the tray into the lounge
Judy inspected it. �You�re late and I don�t expect to have to ask. You should
anticipate my demands. Put the tray on the coffee table.� Lisa did as she was
told, poured out a cup and handed it to Judy.

&nbsp;

�Don�t just stand there you gormless girl.
My feet are sore. Massage them.�

&nbsp;

Lisa knelt down in front of Judy, took off
her shoes and started to massage her feet. Somehow this felt right. Lisa wanted
to be here, kneeling before her mistress giving her pleasure. She was slipping
into a more and more subservient role and finding it fitted. She bent forward
as far as the corset would allow, lifted Judy�s foot to her mouth and kissed
her toes through the stockings. Judy rested her other foot on Lisa�s lap.

&nbsp;

�Closer girl. Move closer.� Judy demanded. Lisa shuffled forward. The foot on
Lisa�s lap was now resting firmly on her groin. The pressure against her was
tantalising, teasing, adding to her aroused state. Lisa tried to push herself
against it.

&nbsp;

�Don�t wriggle.� Reluctantly Lisa kept
still and concentrated on Judy�s foot. All day the erotic tension inside her
had kept rising. She needed release but knew she�d have to wait for it.

&nbsp;

�That�s enough. I need to get ready for
tonight. Run me a bath. Off you go.� Lisa gently put down Judy�s foot and went
to the bathroom. As the water was running she searched through the various
bottles on the shelf and picked out an expensive bath
oil. �I hope this will do.� She thought to herself.� A few moments later Judy appeared wearing her
dressing gown. She shrugged it off and slipped into the bath. Lisa turned to
leave.

&nbsp;

�Where do you think you�re going? Come back
here at once. I expect full personal service from my maids. And what is my
dressing gown doing on the floor?�

&nbsp;

Flustered Lisa picked up the dressing gown
and hung it up. She turned back to the bath where Judy was holding out a
sponge. As quick as she could she rolled up her sleeves as Judy was obviously
impatient. Then kneeling beside the bath she took the sponge. If massaging
Judy�s feet had been a form of worship then this was more so. Lisa adored
Judy�s body and here was the chance to caress it all over.

&nbsp;

Judy lay back and luxuriated in the warm
water. Lisa�s gentle strokes with the sponge were delicious across her flesh.
This was definitely getting her in the mood and if Lisa was spending a little to long washing her breasts and between her legs than was
strictly necessary she wasn�t going to complain. However the water was
beginning to cool and time was moving on. She pushed Lisa away and got out of
the bath.

&nbsp;

Lisa took a towel off the rack and handed
it to Judy. The immediate look of disapproval on Judy�s face told her she was
mistaken. She realised she was to do the towelling. Starting with her shoulders
she gently rubbed Judy dry. By the time she got to Judy�s feet she was kneeling
in front of her, her face right in front of Judy�s perfectly groomed mons. She
couldn�t resist it. She leaned forward and kissed her lips.

&nbsp;

�Don�t be impertinent� Judy pushed her away.
�Now come to my room and help me dress.�

&nbsp;

When they got to Judy�s bedroom Lisa saw a
dark red gown laid out on the bed. Next to it were all sorts of items. Some of
which Lisa couldn�t recognise. Judy picked up a red satin basque and handed it
to Lisa. �Come along now. You know what to do.�

&nbsp;

Lisa started to dress Judy. Whereas her own
outfit was cobbled together from bits and pieces Judy had the complete wardrobe
of an Edwardian lady. Lisa felt all fingers and thumbs as she struggled with
the buttons and laces. Some of the items were very complex. Judy
tutted at her clumsiness. Finally it was finished. Lisa stood back and
looked. Judy looked magnificent, regal and very beautiful. Lisa wanted to kneel
down and worship right there.

&nbsp;

�What are you staring at.
Get on with your tasks. The bathroom�s in an awful
state and you�ve the meal to cook by seven thirty. Get on with it.�

&nbsp;

Lisa hurried off to clean up the bathroom.
She was beginning to understand that this was another job that had to be done
perfectly. Judy, or should she say Ma�am was a stickler for detail. By the time
she finished it was time to start cooking. She wasn�t the best cook in the
world but fortunately the meal Judy had picked out from the market wasn�t too
difficult. She was busy with the pots and pans when the doorbell went. Seven o-clock already! After a few seconds she realised that it
was her duty to answer the door. She put down what she was doing and rushed to
the front door.

&nbsp;

Christine swept in totally ignoring Lisa.
She took off a long cloak and Lisa just managed to grab it before it fell to
the floor. She then dropped a holdall which Lisa gathered up and put with the
cloak in the cupboard. She too was in Edwardian clothes, her gown a delicate
yellow which matched her blonde hair. However Lisa wondered how many Edwardian
women wore stout leather collars like the one round Christine�s neck! A silver
dog tag hung from a metal loop at the front. Lisa wondered with a sharp twinge
of jealousy whether the dog tag said �Judy� like the medallion she wore.

&nbsp;

�Christine my dear. So good of you to come. Do come in.� Judy
swept up to Christine and the two women kissed, not just a peck but a long
lingering kiss. Lisa seethed with jealousy. Judy was her mistress, not
this interloper. The two women went into the lounge and Lisa followed. Judy
offered Christine a drink. Luckily Lisa realised it was her job to fetch it.
Spurred by her jealousy she was determined to prove just how perfect a maid she
could be. Then it was back to the kitchen.

&nbsp;

As she took the food to the table Lisa
smiled to herself. She�d made the effort and she felt she�d done well.
Everything was in its place looking just right. She went on through to the
lounge and announced that the meal was ready.

&nbsp;

Throughout the meal she bustled around making
sure that neither woman wanted for anything. Not that either of them appeared
to notice. They treated her as if she were invisible, as if wine glasses filled
themselves and the food came and empty plates left by magic. She hardly had
time to grab more than a quick bite from the kitchen table as she passed. Not
that she was particularly hungry. Nervousness and anticipation had killed her
appetite. 

&nbsp;

Finally the meal was over and Judy and
Christine relaxed with glasses of brandy as Lisa cleared up. The dishwasher was
just starting when she heard Judy calling her.

&nbsp;

�Jones! Jones! Come in here girl.� Lisa hurried to the dining room.

&nbsp;

�Jones, there have been several regrettable
lapses in your behaviour today. You know what that means,
don�t you?�

&nbsp;

�Yes Ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�Yes Ma�am what?�

&nbsp;

Lisa realised what was expected of her.
�Yes Ma�am. I deserve to be punished.�

&nbsp;

�Quite right. Now let�s go to the playroom. Come along.� Judy led the two women
to the hallway. Taking a key from around her neck she unlocked a door that Lisa
had previously though was just a cupboard. When opened it revealed stairs
leading down. The house had a cellar that Lisa hadn�t even guessed at. She
followed Judy and Christine down the stairs.

&nbsp;

Most cellars are cold, damp and dusty. This
one could not have been more different. The rooms were spacious, heated and
well decorated. The lighting was soft and indirect. Lisa looked around in
amazement. A collection of canes hung from one wall, shackles from another and
there were a number or wooden and leather contraptions she could only guess at.
At one end was a carver chair set up, almost like a throne. Judy walked over to
it and sat down. Lisa stood in the middle of the room anxiously waiting.
Christine stood to one side.

&nbsp;

�There have been several lapses of
behaviour today. You left my dressing gown on the bathroom floor, you�ve been
impertinent several times and you�ve been clumsy and forgetful. What do you
have to say for yourself?�

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry Ma�am. It won�t happen again.�
Lisa replied meekly.

&nbsp;

�I�m going to make sure it doesn�t.
Christine, the horse I think.�

&nbsp;

Christine went to the side of the room and
dragged back what looked like a gymnast�s vaulting horse. Four wooden legs held
it steady and each one had a leather shackle chained to the foot. The top was
quite thin and covered with leather. Christine went over to Lisa and, taking
her by the hand, stood her in front of it. She knelt down and lifting Lisa�s
skirt reached up and undid the laces from the waistband of Lisa�s bloomers. The
loose material fell down, now held by the laces above her knee. Then she guided
Lisa until she was standing against the horse. She shackled Lisa�s ankles left
and right. There was barely enough give in the material of the bloomers to let
Lisa open her legs that wide. Lisa was then bent forward over the horse and her
wrists shacked to the opposite side. Finally Christine lifted the back of her
skirt and tucked it into the ties which held her apron. There was a short
silence and then a flash and the click of a camera shutter. Lisa realised she
was in roughly the same position as the girl in the picture that had started
all this. She had wondered how that girl had felt. Now she knew. The only
difference was that the girl in the picture had been soundly caned. Lisa knew
that difference would not last long. Her mind whiled with a mixture of
emotions. She was nervous about being caned; she was embarrassed by her
nakedness; above all, and somewhat to her surprise, she was aroused.

&nbsp;

Judy got up from the throne and approached
Lisa. She reached between her thighs and cupped her hand over her pubic mound.
One finger wriggled in and began to play with her clitoris.

&nbsp;

�Naughty little maids need to be punished.
That�s how their mistresses show that they care for them. Do you understand?�

&nbsp;

�Yes Ma�am. Yes, I do.� Lisa was panting
gently. She had been kept in a state of semi arousal all day and Judy�s finger
was fast pushing her towards release. She needed release so badly. However she
knew she�d have to be caned first. Looking back between her legs she could see
Christine looking on. She�d show the bitch that she could take her punishment,
that she could be a better slave to Judy than Christine ever was.

&nbsp;

Judy took her hand away and then swish, thwack the first blow fell. A stripe of fire seared
across her bottom. Last night�s spanking had been nothing like this. Swish. Thwack. The second blow fell. �Please, please stop. I
can�t take it.� She managed to gasp out between sobs. Judy took no notice but
carried on. Lisa bucked and struggled, her bottom a searing ball of pain but
she was determined not to use the stop word, she was determined to serve her
mistress.

&nbsp;

Finally the last blow fell and the room was
silent except for Lisa�s sobbing. She felt curiously elated. She�d made it.
Furthermore, in spite of the pain, because of the pain, her whole body felt
high, felt alive. It was more than sexual, almost spiritual. Judy came round
the horse and crouched down beside her.

&nbsp;

�There. Good girl. You�ve taken your
punishment. Now, what do you say?�

&nbsp;

�Thank you. Thank you Ma�am.� Lisa realised
she wasn�t just saying it. She really meant it.

&nbsp;

�Well now you can thank me properly.� Judy
unclipped the shackles from the feet of the horse leaving them locked round
Lisa�s wrists. She drew her arms behind her back and fastened them back
together. Then she fastened Lisa�s ankles together in the same way. Lisa slid
to the floor. Judy returned to the throne and sat down.

&nbsp;

�Here girl, come to me.� Lisa shuffled
forward on her knees. The chains made it a bit awkward. As she approached Judy
lifted up the front of her gown.

&nbsp;

�Now girl, show me how much you love me.
Show me how you thank your mistress.�

&nbsp;

Lisa shuffled between Judy�s knees, leant
forward and burrowed between the folds of clothing. Finally she was there. Her
lips grazed the centre of Judy�s pleasure. Her tongue probed in. Chained and
kneeling before her this was truly an act of worship. Again there was a flash
and the click of the camera but she didn�t care. Her tongue caressed Judy�s
clitoris which swelled beneath it. The sweet taste of Judy was mixed with the
salty taste of her tears that had run down her cheeks. She could feel Judy
responding to her tongue, pushing herself forward. She increased the pressure
but kept the steady rhythm. Even through the layers of clothing that covered
her she could hear Judy moaning with pleasure. Judy reached down and held
Lisa�s head, pulling it into her. Lisa could feel spasms running through the
muscles of Judy�s thighs either side of her head. �Yes, yes, yes, OOOHHHHHHH
YES.� Judy�s orgasm was long and explosive. 

&nbsp;

For a minute or two Judy just sat there
getting her breath back. Then she eased Lisa up from under her gown. And gently pulled her to her. They kissed and kissed. �Well
done girl.� Judy whispered in her ear. �But it�s not over yet.�

&nbsp;

Judy undid Lisa�s shackles and unfastened
the bloomers from where they hung from Lisa�s knees. The skirt, however, was
left tucked up, leaving a cool breeze to sooth Lisa�s poor bottom. Then she
turned to Christine.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

You could tell from Christine�s eyes that
she had been enjoying the show. Her face was flushed and she was obviously
excited.

&nbsp;

�Well Christine, your behaviour has been
less than perfect today, hasn�t it?�

&nbsp;

�Yes Miss.�

&nbsp;

�And what did you do to this poor girl at
lunchtime?�

&nbsp;

�I molested her Miss.�

&nbsp;

�And did I give you permission?�

&nbsp;

�No Miss.�

&nbsp;

�And do you deserve to be punished?�

&nbsp;

�Yes Miss. I was very naughty Miss.�

&nbsp;

�Well, first of all I think we had best get
you more suitably attired for punishment. Jones, remove her outer garments.�

&nbsp;

Lisa went over to Christine and started to
unbutton her dress. As she undid the top buttons she had a quick glance and
confirmed that the tag on the collar did indeed say �Judy�. She removed it
carefully and hung it up.� Next came a white cotton chemise. This too was removed and hung
with the dress. Lisa was impressed how Christine�s clothes, like Judy�s, were
accurate for the period. Christine now stood in a white whaleboned corset not
unlike the one she was wearing, a pair of bloomers, white stockings and
white-heeled ankle boots.

&nbsp;

�And the bloomers I think.� Judy ordered.
There�s no dignity for those being punished.�

&nbsp;

Lisa crouched down in front of Christine to
undo the ties which held the bloomers on. As the fell to the floor they revealed
that Christine was close cropped like Judy. However you could tell she was a
natural blonde. Lisa hung up the clothes neatly and returned to Christine.
Whilst Lisa did not think she was as beautiful as Judy you could tell Christine
was no stranger to the gym. Her breasts, which were semi supported by the top
of the corset, were firm and high. Her legs slender and well toned. Now that
she was semi naked the dark leather of the collar stood out. Lisa thought it
looked perfect and wondered if she could have one of her own.

&nbsp;

�The pillars for you, I think.� Judy got up
and led Christine over to where two stout pillars, five feet or so apart, ran
from the floor to the ceiling. There were metal eyelets attached at various
heights. Judy took the shackles she had unfastened from Lisa and put them on
Christine�s wrists. Then Christine lay down on her back between the pillars and
her wrists were attached. Judy then got two more shackles, this time attached to much longer lengths of chain. These she attached to
Christine�s ankles. She threaded the chain through eyelets about four feet up
and pulled. The effect was to pull Christine�s ankles back over her head,
spreading her legs in the process. Lisa felt she looked open and exposed.

�

�As Jones was the one who you molested I
think it�s only fair if she�s the one who punishes you.� Judy went over to the
wall and took down a flogger consisting of a short handle holding many thin
strips of leather. She handed it to Lisa. Then she showed Lisa how to stand
astride Christine�s waist so that she could whip the inside of Christine�s
thighs as well as the buttocks. Tentatively Lisa gave the first stroke.

&nbsp;

�Much harder than that! Come on girl, she�s not made of glass.� Spurred
on by Judy Lisa set to with a vengeance. As the blows got harder it woke
a spark in Lisa. She was Judy�s slave, not this interloper. The blows rained
down, sometimes on the thighs, sometimes on the buttocks and sometimes straight
onto Christine�s crotch. Between the thuds of the blows she could hear Christine
moaning, the tempo built and built. Christine�s thighs and buttocks were bright
red, criss-crossed with countless red lines where the thongs had struck. Lisa
was losing herself in a blur of excitement.

&nbsp;

�Ok, that�s enough.� Judy�s hand on her arm
stopped her. Lisa was panting from the exertion. Christine lay there writhing
against her bonds moaning gently. The tension in the air was electric. Judy
guided Lisa back and gently pushed her down until she was squatting over
Christine�s face. Christine reached up as far as she could go and kissed Lisa
between her buttocks. Lisa needed no further encouragement. She wriggled down
until her labia were over Christine�s lips. 

&nbsp;

�Lick me bitch! Lick my cunt out!� Lisa
hardly knew what had come over her. Se would never use language like that but
the heat of the moment, the build up of tension, had taken her a place she�s
never known before. She found, as she desperately tried to get Christine�s
tongue as close to her clitoris as possible, that she was bending further and
further forward, further and further towards Christine�s crotch. 

&nbsp;

�Go on, you too, give what you�re getting.�
Judy ordered. She put her hand on the back of Lisa�s neck and pushed her the rest of the way. Lisa took her cue and started to
search out Christine�s clitoris with her tongue.

&nbsp;

Whereas Lisa had licked Judy in a
worshipping, reverential way with Christine it was more like two wild animals.
Lisa had a whole day�s pent up emotion to lose and Christine was giving back as
good as she got. Lisa ground her groin into Christine�s face. She could feel
Christine losing control beneath her. She could feel herself losing
control. She reached round and grabbed Christine�s buttocks, digging her nails
into the soft flesh. This obviously brought Christine to her climax as her
whole body bucked and writhed held down by Lisa�s body and the chains to her
wrists and ankles. Lisa could take it no longer, she
too reached a shuddering climax, her screams of pleasure muffled by her face
deep in Christine�s groin. Lisa rolled off Christine and collapsed panting
beside her.

&nbsp;

Judy crouched down beside Lisa and
whispered in her ear. �Well my sweet? Did you enjoy that?�

&nbsp;

�God that was fantastic. I�ve never felt
anything like that before.�

&nbsp;

�Good, now come on and help me untie Christine.�

&nbsp;

They untied Christine and helped her to her
feet. The three women hugged and kissed each other gently coming down, coming
back to normal. 

&nbsp;

�Right you two. Let�s go upstairs and get
changed. I don�t know about you but I could do with a drink.� They went
upstairs to Judy�s bedroom, Christine grabbing her holdall on the way. There
they helped each other undress. Judy put on her dressing gown, Christine
produced a jogging outfit from her holdall, and Lisa went to her room to find
something loose and comfortable. Then they returned to the lounge. This time it
was Judy who poured the drinks, forever the perfect hostess. She sat down on
the settee but Lisa and Christine preferred to remain standing. After a while
Christine glanced at the clock.

&nbsp;

�Good Heavens! Is that the time! I must go, I�ve got things to do tomorrow.� She turned and hugged
Lisa whispering �Welcome to the club.� in her ear. Then she hugged Judy and
went towards the door.

&nbsp;

�I�ll pick up my bits tomorrow. Is that
OK?�

&nbsp;

�Sure. See you tomorrow.� Judy and Lisa saw
Christine to the front door. Closing it behind her Judy turned to Lisa.

&nbsp;

�Right, it�s late for me too. I�m off to
bed. Are you coming?�

&nbsp;

�With you?� Lisa wasn�t sure where Judy expected her to sleep tonight.

&nbsp;

�Of course. Come here.� Judy gently pulled Lisa into a hug. �It�s not all whips
and chains you know. Come to bed and let me kiss it better. We�ll tidy up in
the morning.�

&nbsp;

Hand in hand the two women went upstairs to
bed.

&nbsp;

To be continued�.

In a warm post coital glow Lisa lay cuddled
in the crook of Judy�s arm. Whilst she still had doubts about what she was
doing she felt safe here. Judy was strong, self assured and confident. So different from her. Absentmindedly she ran her hand over
Judy�s stomach. She loved the feel of it. Judy�s jogging and sessions in the
gym had left her body firm and lean. She really was very beautiful. Her hand
edged lower, just brushing the top of Judy�s pubic hair. She kept it short and
neat, not shaven, more like a crew cut. She snuggled in closer.

&nbsp;

�Ummm. That�s nice. Judy purred. �But we can�t lie here all day. We have
things to do. I need to go into town to shop. Do you want to come too?�

&nbsp;

�Yes please. That would be fun.�

&nbsp;

�Come and join me in the shower and then
we�ll get dressed and go.� Judy got out of bed,
shrugged off her dressing gown and headed for the en-suite.

&nbsp;

Lisa hadn�t shared a shower with anyone
since games days at school. She was a little nervous and unsure of what was
expected of her. She tried to keep herself as far away from Judy as possible.
Judy had other ideas. �Here, let me help you with that.� Judy took the soap and
started to work up a rich lather all over Lisa�s body. Standing face-to-face
Judy wrapped her arms around her and held her close as he worked on Lisa�s back
�You�ve got a lovely little body, you know.� She said as she soaped into the
crack of Lisa�s buttock. �You really should show it off more.�

&nbsp;

Lisa didn�t think she had a lovely body at
all. When she looked in the mirror all she saw was this skinny little thing.
And now Judy was saying she was what? Pretty? �It�s not as nice as yours.� She
murmured as she nestled her head into Judy�s shoulder. The hot water, the soap
and the feel of Judy�s body held close to her were turning her on again.
Lightly she kissed Judy�s neck.

&nbsp;

�No time for that now.� Judy laughed. �Come
on, rinse the soap off. It�s time to get dressed and go.�

&nbsp;

They got out of the shower. Judy handed
Lisa a towel, took one for herself, and they went back into the bedroom. As
Lisa dried herself off Judy wrapped her towel around herself, turned to her
dressing table and rummaged in a draw. Finding what she wanted she turned back
to Lisa.

&nbsp;

�Right young lady. You remember your promise about later?� Judy asked.

&nbsp;

�Err� yes� Lisa replied nervously.

&nbsp;

�Well here�s something to make sure you
don�t forget. Take off that towel, come over here and stand in front of me.�
Judy sat on the stool by her dressing table as Lisa obeyed. Judy produced a
length of golden chain. At one end was a small padlock, at the other a heart
shaped medallion with �Judy� inscribed on it. She passed the chain around
Lisa�s waist and, after a few adjustments clicked the padlock shut. The
medallion was quite heavy and the chain was adjusted so that it nestled just at
the top of Lisa�s labia. Lisa could see that with every movement it would bump
against her, not hard, but enough to know it was there. Judy took the medallion
and pointed out the inscription to Lisa.

&nbsp;

�That�s to remind you just whose property
you are at the moment. Right, off you go and get dressed. I want to leave in
ten minutes. When you�re wearing the chain wear a dress or a skirt, no jeans.
Oh, and no bra or panties either. I�ll be checking!�

&nbsp;

Lisa looked at herself in the mirror. The
medallion nestled in her pubic hair. She was taken by how pretty it looked but
the work �property� echoed in her mind. It wasn�t just the physical chain and
how, or more importantly, where it lay against her. She felt like she�d been
tagged, or possibly gift-wrapped.

&nbsp;

�Come along. Stop admiring yourself. We
haven�t got all day.� Judy told her.

&nbsp;

Lisa hurried back to her room. It was a
bright sunny day so she chose a loose summery dress in light cotton. She felt a
bit exposed; naked under her dress, but a quick check in the mirror confirmed
that it didn�t show. No panties implied no tights
either so she chose short white socks and �sensible� shoes. She went downstairs
and a few minutes later Judy joined her. As ever Judy was a picture of smart
elegance. Lisa felt the difference in their dress emphasised the difference
between them. She felt young and vulnerable, almost grateful for Judy�s
protection.

&nbsp;

As they walked round town hand in hand Lisa
could feel the medallion bumping against her. As it swung forward it would hit the
material of the dress and she wondered if anyone would notice. The cool breeze
around her legs seemed to emphasise her nakedness underneath. She began to
realise the subtleness of what Judy had done to her. Here they were having a
perfectly normal Saturday morning shop but she was kept constantly aware of how
she was dressed and what was to come. This, combined with the bumping of the
medallion, was keeping her lightly aroused. 

&nbsp;

At noon they stopped off at a wine
bar for lunch. Judy chose a quiet corner where they would not be disturbed.
They had hardly sat down, and were still awaiting a waitress to order when�

�Hello Judy, Lisa. How are you? Do you mind
if I join you?� Christine Holmes appeared at their table.

&nbsp;

�Of course not. Pull up a chair.� Judy replied. The waitress arrived and the three
women ordered.

&nbsp;

�So, how are you two getting on?� Christine
asked. �When I found out that Lisa her was looking for digs I thought of you
right away. Was I right or was I right?�

&nbsp;

�Oh were just fine.� Judy replied. �Getting on like a house on fire. Lisa and I are having so
much fun together.�

&nbsp;

�Really?� There was a questioning tone in Christine�s voice.

&nbsp;

�Oh yes. As a matter of fact she�s chained
right now.�

&nbsp;

�Judy!� Lisa was horrified, her face
burning with embarrassment. How could she betray her like this?

&nbsp;

�Now, now dear.� Judy�s tone was firm. �I told you about me and Christine. It�s only
fair that she should know in return.�

&nbsp;

�Chained? Right now?�
Christine had a wicked grin on her face.

&nbsp;

�Oh yes, why don�t you have a feel?� Judy
slipped her arm around Lisa in what looked to the outside world as a friendly
hug. In fact she was holding her quite tightly. Christine shuffled her chair a
little closer and slipped her hand under Lisa�s dress. Fortunately the tablecloth
hid her actions from the rest of the wine bar.

&nbsp;

�Legs apart dear.� Judy whispered in Lisa�s ear. Christine�s hand slipped between her
thighs and found the medallion. In a sitting position it rested much lower,
touching the chair Lisa was sitting on. Christine�s fingers took hold of it,
rubbed it gently up and down Lisa�s labia and then slipped it inside. Lisa
gasped in surprise.

&nbsp;

�Oh yes, she�s really quite wet and
excited. How long has this been going on?� To Lisa�s relief Christine removed
her hand. She licked the tips of her fingers. �She�s quite the horny one.�

&nbsp;

�Just since last night. I caught her peeping at the photo albums, gave her a sound spanking
and we�re taking it from there.�

&nbsp;

Lisa was appalled by what had just
happened. Judy had offered her up without so much as a by your leave and
Christine, without a moments hesitation had touched her in the most intimate
way possible. She felt as if she were a new toy being shared by the two women
but she couldn�t make a fuss without making a scene in this very public place.
Part of her was appalled by herself. Christine was right. She was
aroused and the medallion, still resting inside her, was not making things any
easier. The chain was pulled against her clitoris. She urgently needed to� to
do what? Pull it out was the obvious answer but she couldn�t resist the thrills
running through her. If only she could just touch herself. She moved her hand
down to her lap. Maybe she could reach the chain through the light cotton of
her dress. 

&nbsp;

�No!� Judy took her wrist and pulled her
hand away. �I can guess what Christine did. Leave it there.� The three women
pulled apart as the waitress arrived with their food and drinks.

&nbsp;

When the waitress left Christine took a
long drink from her wine. �So, if Lisa here is chained it looks like it�s playtime tonight.�

&nbsp;

�Yes indeed. Would you like to join us?�
Judy didn�t so much as glance at Lisa for confirmation
that this would be all right with her.

&nbsp;

�I�d love to, I�ve nothing on tonight, or
nothing I can�t cancel.�

&nbsp;

�Come round for supper then. Seven for
seven thirty OK?�

&nbsp;

�I wouldn�t miss it for the world.�

&nbsp;

�But� But�� Lisa stammered.

&nbsp;

�Later dear. We�ll sort it out later.� Once again Judy�s tone brooked no
argument. It was obvious that as far as she was concerned the matter was
settled.

&nbsp;

For the rest of the meal Judy and Christine
chatted idly. Lisa tried to join in but she found it difficult to concentrate.
The tingling from between her thighs mixed with her nervousness about what was
planned for this evening was making her mind reel.

&nbsp;

Finally the meal was over.� �Right, I must be off. I�ll see you later.�
Christine said as she got up from the table. As Lisa got up she felt the chain
tug the medallion from inside her. She told Judy that she had to nip to the
toilet.

&nbsp;

�Right. I�ll come with you. I want to make sure you don�t play with
yourself in there. That�s against the rules.�

&nbsp;

�Rules, what rules?�

&nbsp;

�My rules. Now off we go.�

&nbsp;

When the two women reached the toilet stall
Lisa blurted out �Why? Why did you invite her without asking me? Don�t I get a
say in the matter.�

&nbsp;

�Keep your voice down.� Judy replied
sharply. �Someone might come in at any moment. Let�s keep this private.�

&nbsp;

�Private! You�ve just invited someone I
hardly know to come and see me� and see me�� Lisa couldn�t bring herself to say
the words. Furthermore she wasn�t quite sure exactly what Christine had been
invited to come and see.

&nbsp;

�Look, normally of course I�d check with
you but when you�re my slave I make the decisions. The slave�s
job is just to do what they�re told and disobedience will be punished.�

&nbsp;

�I don�t know. I�m not sure about this.�

&nbsp;

Judy�s tone softened. �Look, I know this is
all a bit much but why don�t you trust me a bit. You know I won�t hurt you,
well, not more than you deserve. Use the stop word if you must but I promise
you if you trust me you�ll find out just how much fun we can have.�

&nbsp;

Lisa thought it over. She could feel her
resistance slipping away. The turmoil in her mind was being overcome by the
itch in her groin and also, truth be told, by a growing curiosity. Guided by
Judy she had just had two of the most fantastic sexual experiences ever. What
more was to come? Furthermore she was getting fond of Judy. She didn�t want to
ruin their relationship by being a prude. Maybe she�d try it just this once. As
Judy had said she could always use the stop word.

&nbsp;

�Come on now, if you came in here to pee
then pee. We�ve got shopping to do.�

&nbsp;

�What? In front of you?�

&nbsp;

�Yes little one.� Judy laughed. �I like to
watch.�

&nbsp;

Somehow peeing in front of Judy was more
intimate, more exposing than all the sex they had shared together. However Lisa
realised she had to get used to the new regime. She pulled her dress up, sat
down on the toilet, moved the medallion to one side and started to pee.

&nbsp;

As Judy watched she smiled to herself. The
�accidental� meeting with Christine had been no accident! A quick phone call
while Lisa was getting dressed was all it had needed. Christine had played her
part perfectly. She had been a bit concerned about moving Lisa on to the next
step so quickly but her choice of a public place had been spot on. She knew
Lisa was well hooked now but she still had to tread a little carefully or she�d
frighten her off and lose her. And with Lisa she felt it wasn�t just another
notch on the bedpost. She was genuinely fond of the girl. Even before last
night she had enjoyed having Lisa around. If they were as compatible as she
thought then there could be great times ahead.




On the drive home Lisa was a quiet and
thoughtful. Judy glanced across.

&nbsp;

�A penny for your
thoughts.� She asked.

&nbsp;

�Judy.� Lisa sounded uncertain. �Is it
always going to be like this?�

&nbsp;

�How do you mean?�

&nbsp;

�I don�t mind being your slave today, well I don�t think I do, but what about tomorrow? Can
we just be Judy and Lisa again?�

&nbsp;

�Of course we can. There are some people
who are always in role but I�m not one of them. Let�s just let tonight take its
course and tomorrow we�ll be Judy and Lisa again. When we�re in play mode we�re
in play mode, when we�re not we�re not. OK?�

&nbsp;

�Yes.� Lisa sounded relieved. �I mean I
want to do this, I really do, but not all the time.�

&nbsp;

�I understand.� Judy realised that Lisa was
reassuring herself more than anything else. �Here we are, back home. Get the
bags out of the car and come up to my room. We�ll sort out the next bit.

&nbsp;

Lisa did as she was told. When she arrived
at Judy�s room Judy was searching around in the back of her wardrobe.

&nbsp;

�Now then.� She said turning to Lisa. �I seem to remember that it was a photo
of Sally as a maid that got you so turned on last night so a maid you shall be.
I haven�t got all the bits so we will have to extemporise.�

&nbsp;

She laid out on the bed a full-length
cotton apron with frilled edges. After a few more minutes searching she found
some old fashioned bloomers, a starched mop cap and an old fashioned corset.
She gathered them together. �Now, off to your room and we�ll see what we can
find.�

&nbsp;

Judy rummaged through Lisa�s wardrobe and
picked out a plain black skirt and white blouse. �These will have to do. Now
let�s get you in uniform. Off with that dress young lady.�

&nbsp;

Lisa obeyed and Judy picked up the corset
and held it against her body. It reached from her hips to just below her
breasts. �Hmm. Not quite your size but there�s enough
lacing to make up for that.� At first the corset seemed quite loose but as Judy
pulled at the laces it got tighter and tighter. Not only was her waist pulled
in but she was forced to stand straighter. Judy tied off the laces and reached
for the bloomers. These were very old fashioned, no elastic but ribbons that
tied off around the waist and above the knees. They were baggy enough not to
restrict the medallion in any way. The skirt, blouse, apron and cap completed
the ensemble.

&nbsp;

Judy stood back, looked her up and down and
sighed. �Well it�s far from perfect but it will have to do for now. There�s
plenty of housework for you to be getting on with. Off you go.�

�Ok� Lisa replied.

&nbsp;

�I beg your pardon Jones. What did you just
say?� Judy�s voice was sharp and firm.

&nbsp;

�Sorry Miss. I forgot.�

&nbsp;

�You forgot? I�ll make sure you never
forget. I demand that you show proper respect at all times. Is
that understood?�

&nbsp;

�Yes Miss. I�m sorry Miss.�

&nbsp;

�That�s better but I prefer Ma�am from my
maids.�

&nbsp;

�Yes Ma�am. Of course
Ma�am.� Lisa hung her head. She felt like a little schoolgirl being told
of by a strict teacher.

&nbsp;

�Well get on with your chores then. Off you
go.�

&nbsp;

As Lisa got on with the housework Judy sat
in the lounge and read a magazine, pointedly ignoring her. The tight corset
restricted her movements and was a constant reminder of her position. As she
polished the big mirror above the fireplace she looked at her reflection. The
cap and apron marked her as quite the little maid at the beck and call of her
mistress. Why did she find it so erotic?

&nbsp;

�Jones! It�s four
 thirty. Where�s my afternoon tea?�

&nbsp;

�Coming Ma�am. I�ll be right there.� Lisa rushed to the kitchen and put on the
kettle. She knew she�d be in more trouble if she didn�t get this right. It
couldn�t be just a cup of tea. Hurriedly she put together a tray with teapot,
cup, saucer and a plate of biscuits to round it off.

&nbsp;

As she brought the tray into the lounge
Judy inspected it. �You�re late and I don�t expect to have to ask. You should
anticipate my demands. Put the tray on the coffee table.� Lisa did as she was
told, poured out a cup and handed it to Judy.

&nbsp;

�Don�t just stand there you gormless girl.
My feet are sore. Massage them.�

&nbsp;

Lisa knelt down in front of Judy, took off
her shoes and started to massage her feet. Somehow this felt right. Lisa wanted
to be here, kneeling before her mistress giving her pleasure. She was slipping
into a more and more subservient role and finding it fitted. She bent forward
as far as the corset would allow, lifted Judy�s foot to her mouth and kissed
her toes through the stockings. Judy rested her other foot on Lisa�s lap.

&nbsp;

�Closer girl. Move closer.� Judy demanded. Lisa shuffled forward. The foot on
Lisa�s lap was now resting firmly on her groin. The pressure against her was
tantalising, teasing, adding to her aroused state. Lisa tried to push herself
against it.

&nbsp;

�Don�t wriggle.� Reluctantly Lisa kept
still and concentrated on Judy�s foot. All day the erotic tension inside her
had kept rising. She needed release but knew she�d have to wait for it.

&nbsp;

�That�s enough. I need to get ready for
tonight. Run me a bath. Off you go.� Lisa gently put down Judy�s foot and went
to the bathroom. As the water was running she searched through the various
bottles on the shelf and picked out an expensive bath
oil. �I hope this will do.� She thought to herself.� A few moments later Judy appeared wearing her
dressing gown. She shrugged it off and slipped into the bath. Lisa turned to
leave.

&nbsp;

�Where do you think you�re going? Come back
here at once. I expect full personal service from my maids. And what is my
dressing gown doing on the floor?�

&nbsp;

Flustered Lisa picked up the dressing gown
and hung it up. She turned back to the bath where Judy was holding out a
sponge. As quick as she could she rolled up her sleeves as Judy was obviously
impatient. Then kneeling beside the bath she took the sponge. If massaging
Judy�s feet had been a form of worship then this was more so. Lisa adored
Judy�s body and here was the chance to caress it all over.

&nbsp;

Judy lay back and luxuriated in the warm
water. Lisa�s gentle strokes with the sponge were delicious across her flesh.
This was definitely getting her in the mood and if Lisa was spending a little to long washing her breasts and between her legs than was
strictly necessary she wasn�t going to complain. However the water was
beginning to cool and time was moving on. She pushed Lisa away and got out of
the bath.

&nbsp;

Lisa took a towel off the rack and handed
it to Judy. The immediate look of disapproval on Judy�s face told her she was
mistaken. She realised she was to do the towelling. Starting with her shoulders
she gently rubbed Judy dry. By the time she got to Judy�s feet she was kneeling
in front of her, her face right in front of Judy�s perfectly groomed mons. She
couldn�t resist it. She leaned forward and kissed her lips.

&nbsp;

�Don�t be impertinent� Judy pushed her
away. �Now come to my room and help me dress.�

&nbsp;

When they got to Judy�s bedroom Lisa saw a
dark red gown laid out on the bed. Next to it were all sorts of items. Some of
which Lisa couldn�t recognise. Judy picked up a red satin basque and handed it
to Lisa. �Come along now. You know what to do.�

&nbsp;

Lisa started to dress Judy. Whereas her own
outfit was cobbled together from bits and pieces Judy had the complete wardrobe
of an Edwardian lady. Lisa felt all fingers and thumbs as she struggled with
the buttons and laces. Some of the items were very complex. Judy
tutted at her clumsiness. Finally it was finished. Lisa stood back and
looked. Judy looked magnificent, regal and very beautiful. Lisa wanted to kneel
down and worship right there.

&nbsp;

�What are you staring at? Get on with your
tasks. The bathroom�s in an awful state and you�ve the
meal to cook by seven
 thirty. Get on with it.�

&nbsp;

Lisa hurried off to clean up the bathroom.
She was beginning to understand that this was another job that had to be done
perfectly. Judy, or should she say Ma�am, was a stickler for detail. By the
time she finished it was time to start cooking. She wasn�t the best cook in the
world but fortunately the meal Judy had picked out from the market wasn�t too
difficult. She was busy with the pots and pans when the doorbell went. Seven o-clock already! After a few seconds she realised that it
was her duty to answer the door. She put down what she was doing and rushed to
the front door.

&nbsp;

Christine swept in totally ignoring Lisa.
She took off a long cloak and Lisa just managed to grab it before it fell to
the floor. She then dropped a holdall which Lisa gathered up and put with the
cloak in the cupboard. She too was in Edwardian clothes, her gown a delicate
yellow which matched her blonde hair. However Lisa wondered how many Edwardian
women wore stout leather collars like the one round Christine�s neck! A silver
dog tag hung from a metal loop at the front. Lisa wondered with a sharp twinge
of jealousy whether the dog tag said �Judy� like the medallion she wore.

&nbsp;

�Christine my dear. So good of you to come. Do come in.� Judy
swept up to Christine and the two women kissed, not just a peck but a long
lingering kiss. Lisa seethed with jealousy. Judy was her mistress, not
this interloper. The two women went into the lounge and Lisa followed. Judy
offered Christine a drink. Luckily Lisa realised it was her job to fetch it.
Spurred by her jealousy she was determined to prove just how perfect a maid she
could be. Then it was back to the kitchen.

&nbsp;

As she took the food to the table Lisa
smiled to herself. She�d made the effort and she felt she�d done well.
Everything was in its place looking just right. She went on through to the
lounge and announced that the meal was ready.

&nbsp;

Throughout the meal she bustled around
making sure that neither woman wanted for anything. Not that either of them
appeared to notice. They treated her as if she were invisible, as if wine
glasses filled themselves and the food came and empty plates left by magic. She
hardly had time to grab more than a quick bite from the kitchen table as she
passed. Not that she was particularly hungry. Nervousness and anticipation had
killed her appetite. 

&nbsp;

Finally the meal was over and Judy and
Christine relaxed with glasses of brandy as Lisa cleared up. The dishwasher was
just starting when she heard Judy calling her.

&nbsp;

�Jones! Jones! Come in here girl.� Lisa hurried to the dining room.

&nbsp;

�Jones, there have been several regrettable
lapses in your behaviour today. You know what that means,
don�t you?�

&nbsp;

�Yes Ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�Yes Ma�am what?�

&nbsp;

Lisa realised what was expected of her.
�Yes Ma�am. I deserve to be punished.�

&nbsp;

�Quite right. Now let�s go to the playroom. Come along.� Judy led the two women
to the hallway. Taking a key from around her neck she unlocked a door that Lisa
had previously though was just a cupboard. When opened it revealed stairs
leading down. The house had a cellar that Lisa hadn�t even guessed at. She
followed Judy and Christine down the stairs.

&nbsp;

Most cellars are cold, damp and dusty. This
one could not have been more different. The rooms were spacious, heated and
well decorated. The lighting was soft and indirect. Lisa looked around in
amazement. A collection of canes hung from one wall, shackles from another and
there were a number or wooden and leather contraptions she could only guess at.
At one end was a carver chair set up almost like a throne. Judy walked over to
it and sat down. Lisa stood in the middle of the room anxiously waiting.
Christine stood to one side.

&nbsp;

�There have been several lapses of
behaviour today. You left my dressing gown on the bathroom floor, you�ve been
impertinent several times and you�ve been clumsy and forgetful. What do you
have to say for yourself?�

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry Ma�am. It won�t happen again.�
Lisa replied meekly.

&nbsp;

�I�m going to make sure it doesn�t.
Christine, the horse I think.�

&nbsp;

Christine went to the side of the room and
dragged back what looked like a gymnast�s vaulting horse. Four wooden legs held
it steady and each one had a leather shackle chained to the foot. The top was
quite thin and covered with leather. Christine went over to Lisa and, taking
her by the hand, stood her in front of it. She knelt down and lifting Lisa�s
skirt reached up and undid the laces from the waistband of Lisa�s bloomers. The
loose material fell down, now held by the laces above her knee. Then she guided
Lisa until she was standing against the horse. She shackled Lisa�s ankles left
and right. There was barely enough give in the material of the bloomers to let
Lisa open her legs that wide. Lisa was then bent forward over the horse and her
wrists shacked to the opposite side. Finally Christine lifted the back of her
skirt and tucked it into the ties which held her apron. There was a short
silence and then a flash and the click of a camera shutter. Lisa realised she
was in roughly the same position as the girl in the picture that had started
all this. She had wondered how that girl had felt. Now she knew. The only
difference was that the girl in the picture had been soundly caned. Lisa knew
that difference would not last long. Her mind whiled with a mixture of
emotions. She was nervous about being caned; she was embarrassed by her
nakedness; above all, and somewhat to her surprise, she was aroused.

&nbsp;

Judy got up from the throne and approached
Lisa. She reached between her thighs and cupped her hand over her pubic mound.
One finger wriggled in and began to play with her clitoris.

&nbsp;

�Naughty little maids need to be punished.
That�s how their mistresses show that they care for them. Do you understand?�

&nbsp;

�Yes Ma�am. Yes, I do.� Lisa was panting
gently. She had been kept in a state of semi arousal all day and Judy�s finger
was fast pushing her towards release. She needed release so badly. However she
knew she�d have to be caned first. Looking back between her legs she could see
Christine looking on. She�d show the bitch that she could take her punishment,
that she could be a better slave to Judy than Christine ever was.

&nbsp;

Judy took her hand away and then swish, thwack the first blow fell. A stripe of fire seared
across her bottom. Last night�s spanking had been nothing like this. Swish. Thwack. The second blow fell. �Please, please stop. I
can�t take it.� She managed to gasp out between sobs. Judy took no notice but
carried on. Lisa bucked and struggled, her bottom a searing ball of pain but
she was determined not to use the stop word, she was determined to serve her
mistress.

&nbsp;

Finally the last blow fell and the room was
silent except for Lisa�s sobbing. She felt curiously elated. She�d made it.
Furthermore, in spite of the pain, because of the pain, her whole body felt
high, felt alive. It was more than sexual, almost spiritual. Judy came round
the horse and crouched down beside her.

&nbsp;

�There. Good girl. You�ve taken your
punishment. Now, what do you say?�

&nbsp;

�Thank you. Thank you Ma�am.� Lisa realised
she wasn�t just saying it. She really meant it.

&nbsp;

�Well now you can thank me properly.� Judy
unclipped the shackles from the feet of the horse leaving them locked round Lisa�s
wrists. She drew her arms behind her back and fastened them back together. She
went to the other side of the horse and fastened Lisa�s ankles together in the
same way. Lisa slid to the floor. Judy returned to the throne and sat down.

&nbsp;

�Here girl, come to me.� Lisa shuffled
forward on her knees. The chains made it a bit awkward. As she approached Judy
lifted up the front of her gown.

&nbsp;

�Now girl, show me how much you love me.
Show me how you thank your mistress.�

&nbsp;

Lisa shuffled between Judy�s knees, leant
forward and burrowed between the folds of clothing. Finally she was there. Her
lips grazed the centre of Judy�s pleasure. Her tongue probed in. Chained and
kneeling before her this was truly an act of worship. Again there was a flash
and the click of the camera but she didn�t care. Her tongue caressed Judy�s
clitoris which swelled beneath it. The sweet taste of Judy was mixed with the
salty taste of her tears that had run down her cheeks. She could feel Judy
responding to her tongue, pushing herself forward. She increased the pressure
but kept the steady rhythm. Even through the layers of clothing that covered
her she could hear Judy moaning with pleasure. Judy reached down and held
Lisa�s head, pulling it into her. Lisa could feel spasms running through the
muscles of Judy�s thighs either side of her head. �Yes, yes, yes, OOOHHHHHHH
YES.� Judy�s orgasm was long and explosive. 

&nbsp;

For a minute or two Judy just sat there
getting her breath back. Then she eased Lisa up from under her gown. And gently pulled her to her. They kissed and kissed. �Well
done girl.� Judy whispered in her ear. �But it�s not over yet.�

&nbsp;

Judy undid Lisa�s shackles and unfastened
the bloomers from where they hung from Lisa�s knees. The skirt, however, was
left tucked up, leaving a cool breeze to sooth Lisa�s poor bottom. Then she
turned to Christine.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

You could tell from Christine�s eyes that
she had been enjoying the show. Her face was flushed and she was obviously
excited.

&nbsp;

�Well Christine, your behaviour has been
less than perfect today, hasn�t it?�

&nbsp;

�Yes Miss.�

&nbsp;

�And what did you do to this poor girl at
lunchtime?�

&nbsp;

�I molested her Miss.�

&nbsp;

�And did I give you permission?�

&nbsp;

�No Miss.�

&nbsp;

�And do you deserve to be punished?�

&nbsp;

�Yes Miss. I was very naughty Miss.�

&nbsp;

�Well, first of all I think we had best get
you more suitably attired for punishment. Jones, remove her outer garments.�

&nbsp;

Lisa went over to Christine and started to
unbutton her dress. As she undid the top buttons she had a quick glance and
confirmed that the tag on the collar did indeed say �Judy�. She removed it
carefully and hung it up.� Next came a white cotton chemise. This too was removed and hung
with the dress. Lisa was impressed how Christine�s clothes, like Judy�s, were
accurate for the period. Christine now stood in a white whaleboned corset not
unlike the one she was wearing, a pair of bloomers, white stockings and
white-heeled ankle boots.

&nbsp;

�And the bloomers I think.� Judy ordered.
There�s no dignity for those being punished.�

&nbsp;

Lisa crouched down in front of Christine to
undo the ties which held the bloomers on. As the fell to the floor they
revealed that Christine was close cropped like Judy. You see that she was a
natural blonde. Lisa hung up the clothes neatly and returned to Christine.
Whilst Lisa did not think she was as beautiful as Judy you could tell Christine
was no stranger to the gym. Her breasts, which were semi supported by the top
of the corset, were firm and high. Her legs slender and well toned. Now that
she was semi naked the dark leather of the collar stood out. Lisa thought it
looked perfect and wondered if she could have one of her own.

&nbsp;

�The pillars for you, I think.� Judy got up
and led Christine over to where two stout pillars, five feet or so apart, ran
from the floor to the ceiling. There were metal eyelets attached at various
heights. Judy took the shackles she had unfastened from Lisa and put them on
Christine�s wrists. Then Christine lay down on her back between the pillars and
her wrists were attached to eyelets near the bottom of the pillars. Judy then
got two more shackles, this time attached to much
longer lengths of chain. These she attached to Christine�s ankles. She threaded
the chain through eyelets about four feet up and pulled. The effect was to pull
Christine�s ankles back over her head, spreading her legs in the process. When
Christine was almost bent double Judy clipped the chains fast. Christine�s
buttocks had been lifted clear of the floor and her legs were spread as wide as
possible. Lisa felt she looked open and exposed.

�

�As Jones was the one who you molested I
think it�s only fair if she�s the one who punishes you.� Judy went over to the
wall and took down a flogger consisting of a short handle holding many thin
strips of leather. She handed it to Lisa. Then she showed Lisa how to stand
astride Christine�s waist so that she could whip the inside of Christine�s
thighs as well as the buttocks. Tentatively Lisa gave the first stroke.

&nbsp;

�Much harder than that! Come on girl, she�s not made of glass.� Spurred
on by Judy Lisa set to with a vengeance. As the blows got harder it woke
a spark in Lisa. She was Judy�s slave, not this interloper. The blows rained
down, sometimes on the thighs, sometimes on the buttocks and sometimes straight
onto Christine�s crotch. Between the thuds of the blows she could hear
Christine moaning, the tempo built and built. Christine�s thighs and buttocks
were bright red, criss-crossed with countless red lines where the thongs had
struck. Lisa was losing herself in a blur of excitement.

&nbsp;

�Ok, that�s enough.� Judy�s hand on her arm
stopped her. Lisa was panting from the exertion. Christine lay there writhing
against her bonds moaning gently. The tension in the air was electric. Judy
guided Lisa back and gently pushed her down until she was squatting over
Christine�s face. Christine reached up as far as she could go and kissed Lisa
between her buttocks. Lisa needed no further encouragement. She wriggled down
until her labia were over Christine�s lips. 

&nbsp;

�Lick me bitch! Lick my cunt out!� Lisa
hardly knew what had come over her. She would never use language like that but
the heat of the moment, the build up of tension, had taken her a place she�s
never known before. She found, as she desperately tried to get Christine�s
tongue as close to her clitoris as possible, that she was bending further and
further forward, further and further towards Christine�s crotch. 

&nbsp;

�Go on, you too, give what you�re getting.�
Judy ordered. She put her hand on the back of Lisa�s neck and pushed her the rest of the way. Lisa took her cue and started to
search out Christine�s clitoris with her tongue.

&nbsp;

Whereas Lisa had licked Judy in a
worshipping, reverential way with Christine it was more like two wild animals.
Lisa had a whole day�s pent up emotion to lose and Christine was giving back as
good as she got. Lisa ground her groin into Christine�s face. She could feel
Christine losing control beneath her. She could feel herself losing
control. She reached forward and grabbed Christine�s buttocks, digging her
nails hard into the soft flesh. This brought Christine to her climax and her
whole body bucked and writhed held down by Lisa�s body and the chains to her
wrists and ankles. Lisa could take it no longer, she
too reached a shuddering climax, her screams of pleasure muffled by her face
deep in Christine�s groin. At last Lisa rolled off Christine and collapsed
panting beside her.

&nbsp;

Judy crouched down beside Lisa and
whispered in her ear. �Well my sweet? Did you enjoy that?�

&nbsp;

�God that was fantastic. I�ve never felt
anything like that before.�

&nbsp;

�Good, now come on and help me untie
Christine.�

&nbsp;

They untied Christine and helped her to her
feet. The three women hugged and kissed each other gently as the mood calmed
down, coming back to normal. 

&nbsp;

�Right you two. Let�s go upstairs and get
changed. I don�t know about you but I could do with a drink.� They went
upstairs to Judy�s bedroom, Christine grabbing her holdall on the way. There
they helped each other undress. Judy put on her dressing gown, Christine
produced a jogging outfit from her holdall, and Lisa went to her room to find
something loose and comfortable. Then they returned to the lounge. This time it
was Judy who poured the drinks, forever the perfect hostess. She sat down on
the settee but Lisa and Christine preferred to remain standing. After a while
Christine glanced at the clock.

&nbsp;

�Good Heavens! Is that the time! I must go, I�ve got things to do tomorrow.� She turned and hugged
Lisa whispering �Welcome to the club.� in her ear. Then she hugged Judy and
went towards the door.

&nbsp;

�I�ll pick up my bits tomorrow. Is that
OK?�

&nbsp;

�Sure. See you tomorrow.� Judy and Lisa saw
Christine to the front door. Closing it behind her Judy turned to Lisa.

&nbsp;

�Right, it�s late for me too. I�m off to
bed. Are you coming?�

&nbsp;

�With you?� Lisa wasn�t sure where Judy expected her to sleep tonight.

&nbsp;

�Of course. Come here.� Judy gently pulled Lisa into a hug. �It�s not all whips
and chains you know. Come to bed and let me kiss it better. We�ll tidy up in
the morning.�

&nbsp;

Hand in hand the two women went upstairs to
bed.

&nbsp;

To be continued�.

Lisa rolled over and stretched. For the
second morning in succession she found herself in Judy�s bed. She thought back
over what had happened yesterday. The afternoon had been so intense, and then,
in the playroom, she�d never felt so wild, so uninhibited, so incredibly turned
on. She blushed when she remembered telling Christine to �Lick me bitch! Lick
my cunt out!� She never used language like that. It was as if she�d found an
inner self, free from the inhibitions of normal life.

&nbsp;

And afterwards, in bed with Judy, then it
had been soft and gentle. Sweet caresses, two bodies melting together in mutual
pleasure. In Judy�s arms she felt safe and protected. This is where she wanted
to be. And to think that she had always thought of lesbians as having crew cuts,
dungarees and Doc Martin boots! She couldn�t deny it now. Her relationship had
gone far beyond �good friends�. How would she ever tell Mum and Dad? Still
she�d cross that bridge when she got to it. No point in upsetting them,
especially as now she lived so far from home. They didn�t need to know, not yet
anyway, and never the full story.

&nbsp;

Talking of Judy, where was she? Lisa
glanced at the bedside clock. Nearly ten-o-clock! Time she was up and about,
even on a Sunday. She got out of bed and scampered to her room to find
something to wear around the house. A pair of loose fitting cotton pyjamas
would do just fine. She didn�t want to get fully dressed quite yet. What were
Sundays for if not lazing around the house? She went down stairs, fixed herself a cup of coffee, and went off to find Judy.

&nbsp;

Judy was in the study working on the PC.
When Lisa entered she looked up. �Oh, is that coffee? I don�t suppose you made
one for me?�

&nbsp;

�Sorry, I didn�t think.�

&nbsp;

�Never mind. Maybe we�ll discuss that later.� There was a twinkle in Judy�s eye.
�Come and have a look.�

&nbsp;

Judy had plugged her camera into the PC and
was busy with the picture editor.

&nbsp;

�I�m looking for something nice for the
album. What do you think?�

&nbsp;

Lisa sat down beside Judy and looked at the
screen. It was covered in thumbnail pictures taken last night. She hadn�t
realised that Judy and Christine had been so busy taking them. She guessed she
had been too involved with other things at the time. One shot of her bent over
the horse was reminiscent of the photo that had started it all. The thumbnail
didn�t show much detail so she reached for the mouse and double clicked on it
to bring it to full screen. The camera was obviously a good one. The picture
was clear and sharp.

&nbsp;

�Yes, I like that one too. But what about this one?� Judy took back the mouse and
opened up another picture. This one showed Lisa in full action with the flogger
on Christine�s bottom and thighs. Again the picture was sharp and clear. The
expression on Lisa�s face betrayed the depth of her emotion.

&nbsp;

�I guess I got a bit carried away.� Lisa
confessed.

&nbsp;

�You did, didn�t you? Christine will know
all about it this morning!� Judy laughed. �You�re quite the little minx when
you get going. And the language!�

Lisa blushed again. �I�m sorry, I didn�t
realise that you had heard that bit.�

&nbsp;

�Don�t be sorry. We all get carried away.
That�s what it�s all about. Anyway, how�s your bottom this morning? A bit sore perhaps?�

&nbsp;

�A bit! It�s covered with bruises.�

&nbsp;

�Let me see.�

&nbsp;

Lisa got up from the chair, turned away
from Judy and shyly pushed down her pyjama bottoms. Judy swivelled her chair
around to face Lisa and reached out to stroke her. Gently she felt around the
twin globes of Lisa�s bottom causing sharp little twinges from time to time.
Then she bent forward and kissed it, one kiss on each cheek.

&nbsp;

�You�re fine,
they�ll be gone in a day or so. Anyway it isn�t a proper session if it doesn�t
leave a reminder or two.� Judy laughed. �Now pull your pyjama bottoms back up
and sit down. I�d like three good shots from last night and we�ve plenty to
choose from. I don�t normally take so many from one session but as it was your
first time I wanted to have something for both of us to remember it by.�

&nbsp;

Lisa did as she was told and the two women
went back to studying the photos.

&nbsp;

�Who gets to see these?� Lisa asked. �I
mean they�re private, aren�t they? You don�t go posting them on the web or
anything, please tell me you don�t.�

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry, there just for you and me. I
don�t post them anywhere.� Judy leaned across and kissed Lisa. She wasn�t being
strictly true but Lisa wasn�t ready for the whole truth, not yet anyway. It was
true she didn�t post them on the web but around the club� but Lisa didn�t know
about the club yet. Soon maybe, but not today.

&nbsp;

Eventually they chose one of Lisa across
the horse, one of her flogging Christine and one with her buried under Judy�s
gown. You couldn�t see much of Lisa in the last shot, just her bottom sticking
out covered in bright red stripes, but Judy�s face and her hands reaching down
to the back of Lisa�s head, showed the passion of the moment. They were busy
printing them off when the front door bell chimed.

&nbsp;

Judy glanced out of the study window.
�That�s Christine come for her clothes. Come on, let�s go and have a coffee
with her.� Judy went to answer the door as Lisa went to the kitchen to put on
the kettle. As they chatted over coffee around the kitchen table Lisa once
again found herself the junior partner. Judy and Christine had such a history
together. They had things to chat about that Lisa wasn�t involved in and she
was beginning to feel quite left out. Judy noticed her discomfort.

&nbsp;

�Well Christine, what do you think of young
Lisa here?�

&nbsp;

�She�s got a strong right arm, I can tell
you that!� Christine laughed. �It�s lovely to find another playmate for our
club, especially one so young and pretty.�

&nbsp;

�Club? What club?� Lisa was puzzled. �I remember you said �Welcome to the
club� last night.�

&nbsp;

Judy kicked Christine beneath the table.
�Oh, it�s just an expression. I just mean the three of us.� Christine was
flustered. She hadn�t realised that Judy hadn�t told Lisa about the club. She
hoped she�d covered OK. �Anyway, you certainly got carried away last night.
Which do you prefer? Top or bottom?�

&nbsp;

�Sorry, I�m not sure I understand.�

&nbsp;

�Ok, which did you prefer, flogging me or
being caned by Judy?�

&nbsp;

Lisa thought about this for a while. What
she really liked was worshiping Judy but when she had been flogging Christine
she had felt a different high, almost as intense. �I�m not sure.� She was uneasy
about opening up in front of Christine. She seemed so easy and matter of fact.
To Lisa is was still not something she could talk
about freely. Also, whilst it�s odd to call someone a stranger when you were
performing lewd and intimate acts with her only twelve hours ago, Lisa still
felt uneasy around Christine. 

&nbsp;

�Well anyway, sometime soon I want to get
my own back. Give you a taste of your own medicine. I normally prefer to be
bottom but variety�s the spice of life.�

&nbsp;

�I loved your outfit.� Lisa felt she had to
change the subject.

&nbsp;

�Thank you. Judy helped me choose it.� Once
again Lisa felt a stab of jealousy at being reminded at how much Judy and
Christine had in common. �What about you? What would you like?�

&nbsp;

Lisa felt she had to stake her ground. �I�d
like a proper maid�s outfit. Last night�s was just put together from bits and
pieces that Judy found. I�d like the real thing.� She turned to Judy. �Will you
help me buy it? Please?�

&nbsp;

�Of course I will.� Judy replied. �Just one point. You do know how expensive they are, don�t
you?�

&nbsp;

�No, no I don�t. Is it much?�

&nbsp;

�Well, for a complete outfit you�re looking
at three to four hundred pounds. I know a shop that specialises in period
accuracy. That�s the point. Those things you get from the sex shops just look
cheap and tatty. To get the correct mood you want the real thing.�

&nbsp;

Lisa was silent for a while. She was
determined to buy a proper outfit. Last night her bits and pieces had felt out
of place beside the perfection of Judy�s and Christine�s outfits. And there was
another thing.

&nbsp;

�Where do you get the collars from? I�d
like one a bit like Christine�s� Lisa asked.

&nbsp;

�From all over the place but I get the from the same shop. Again they�re not cheap but quality
never is. But you shouldn�t buy that. You collar should be given to you by your
mistress. It�s part of being owned.� Another stab of
jealousy. The collar that Christine had worn must have been given to her
by Judy.

&nbsp;

Lisa sat there quietly fuming. She tried to
keep a smile on the outside but her insides were in turmoil. �That bitch turns
up with her fancy clothes and fancy collar.� She thought to herself. �I�ll
always be in second place, always second to her!�

&nbsp;

Christine finished her coffee and put down
the cup. �I must be off. I�ll go downstairs and pack up.� She grabbed a
suithanger she had brought with her. �Lisa, be a darling, some of the bits are
upstairs. Would you go and get them?�

&nbsp;

Still fuming Lisa went upstairs to the
bedroom and grabbed the few bits that Christine had taken off up there last
night. Then she went back downstairs to the playroom where Christine was busy
packing the suithanger and Judy was tidying up. �Here you go.� She offered the
bits to Christine trying not to sound too offhand.

&nbsp;

Christine finished packing as Judy and Lisa
continued to tidy. �Right, that�s it. I�m off.� Picking up the suithanger
Christine headed for the door. Judy saw her out and returned to the playroom.

&nbsp;

�I get the impression you�re not too keen
on Christine.� Judy said as she re-entered.

&nbsp;

�Well, err�� Lisa did not want to upset
Judy. After all Christine was her oldest friend. However, if she couldn�t hide
her feelings perhaps she should be honest. �It�s just� It�s just that� Well,
does she have to wear a collar with your name on it?�

&nbsp;

�Do I detect a bit of jealousy, young lady?
Well?�

&nbsp;

�I�m your slave,
I�m the one with the chain around me. I don�t want to share you.� Lisa blurted.
She hadn�t wanted to betray herself like that but it all came tumbling out.

&nbsp;

Judy came over and held her gently by the
shoulders. �I thought so. Look, I like to play games with lots of partners. The
more the merrier some times. You�re going to have to live with that. I hope
you�ll want to join in. But if it�s any consolation remember, you�re the one in
my bed at night, you�re the one I cuddle up to. You mustn�t get games mixed up
with real life. Of course she wears my collar. We go back a long way and when
I�m in charge it�s only right that she wears it, but that�s all it is. Anything
further died between us a long time ago. You�re my girl now, you and only you.�

&nbsp;

�Thank you Judy. Thank you.� Lisa felt a
huge wave of relief. She almost fell forward into Judy�s arms.

&nbsp;

�Now come along, stop being a silly and
come upstairs. We�ve finished down here. Let�s go and get dressed. It�s time we
got on with the day.�

&nbsp;

Judy and Lisa went upstairs to Judy�s
bedroom. Lisa was just picking up her clothes ready to go to her room to get
dressed when Judy turned to her.

&nbsp;

�Do you mind me saying something? You�re a
bit bushy downstairs. You could do with a trim.�

&nbsp;

�I�ve tried but any time I go near with
scissors I get nervous and start shaking. I�m worried I�ll cut off more than
hair.�

&nbsp;

�You don�t want to use scissors. I�ve got
just the thing.� Judy rummaged in a draw and produced a set of professional
hairdresser�s clippers. She clicked on a number one guard to give the closest
possible trim without actually shaving all the hair off. �Here, let me do it
for you.�

&nbsp;

Judy organised Lisa lying on the bed with a
towel beneath her to catch the hairs. She plugged in the clippers and got on
the bed next to Lisa. As soon as she started to approach Lisa began to squirm
away. �Stay still. I don�t want to clip anything I shouldn�t.�

&nbsp;

Lisa stayed as still as she could but as
soon as the clippers touched Lisa�s belly she started squirming again.

&nbsp;

�If you can�t stay still I�ll have to tie
you down. That will keep you still.� Judy mocked.

&nbsp;

�Would you?� Lisa replied with a wicked
grin. The idea of being tied down whilst she was being shaved seemed rather
appealing.

&nbsp;

�Just wait there.� Judy switched off the
clippers and put them down. She went to the wardrobe and retrieved the holdall.
She returned to the bed carrying four leather shackles. It didn�t take long
before Lisa was tied fast, spread-eagled across the bed. Judy didn�t stop at
that, however. Returning to the holdall she brought out a black leather
blindfold. This fitted snugly and cut out any chance of Lisa seeing anything.
Lisa was expecting to hear the clippers start up again. Instead, there was the
sound of more rummaging. She felt Judy get back on the bed. Judy gripped Lisa�s
nose with her fingers. In surprise Lisa opened her mouth which allowed Judy to
push in what felt like a rubber ball. Indeed it was a rubber ball but with a
leather strap through it to hold it in place. Judy lifted her head and fastened
the strap. The gag was uncomfortable without being painful and allowed Lisa to
breath. Conversation, however, would be limited to grunts and squeaks. Lisa lay
there bound, blindfolded and gagged. She felt Judy move around on the bed and
the sound of the clippers started again.

&nbsp;

The blindfold and the gag seemed to
heighten Lisa�s senses. The straps which bound her made her feel helpless and vulnerable, she was truly at Judy�s mercy. Then she felt the
clippers touch her stomach. Even is she had been free the vibrations of the
clippers would have been erotic. Tied up as she was her whole body seemed to
tingle. She felt the clippers begin to shave away her hair. Judy was obviously
taking her time. Whether she was just being thorough or whether she was aware
of how intense this was Lisa could only guess. As the clippers worked lower
Lisa began to squirm against her bonds.�
Judy laid her hand on Lisa�s stomach to hold her steady. It didn�t stay
there long though because as the clippers moved lower Judy had to use her other
hand to push the flesh apart so as to get into the cracks. As she manipulated
Lisa�s labia she brushed against her clitoris either by accident or design
sending thrills of excitement through her body. Lisa�s breath was shallow and
panting. Her moans stifled by the gag. The vibration of the clippers against
her skin in most intimate places was driving her wild. She couldn�t take much
more, she felt herself starting to climax, any second now� 

&nbsp;

Judy switched off the clippers and sat
back. She was well aware of the state Lisa was in. Lisa was begging to be
allowed to come but the words were stifled by the gag. �What�s that, little
one? I can�t hear you.� She mocked. �Have I left you a little excited?�

&nbsp;

�Please! Please!� Lisa begged but it came
out as a muffled �Eeee! Eeee!�

&nbsp;

Gently Judy brushed her fingers against
Lisa�s labia. The short hairs gave a tingling feeling. �Is that what you want?�
she teased. �But you�ll have to wait a while. I come before you do. That�s the
rules.�

&nbsp;

Lisa nodded her head in agreement pleading
with her eyes. She would have agreed to anything right then. She felt Judy undo
the strap that held the gag and then it was removed. She sighed in pleasure but
was told firmly to keep quiet. Then she felt Judy kneel either side of her
head. The unmistakable taste and feel of Judy�s vagina rested on her mouth.
Lisa pushed out her tongue and searched for Judy�s clitoris. Judy put a
considerable portion of her weight on Lisa, forcing herself on her. It didn�t
take long before Judy was moaning in pleasure. She pushed herself harder into
Lisa�s face urging her on. Her moans turned to gasps and with a cry of �YES!
YES! OHHH LISA!� she shuddered as she came.

&nbsp;

After a pause to get her breath back Judy
manoeuvred herself off Lisa and lay down beside her. Judy reached an arm across
and started stroking Lisa�s lower belly. Lisa felt Judy�s fingers busily
probing, searching, finding her. Judy started to kiss
her breasts homing in on the nipples. Lisa felt Judy�s teeth nibbling, no
biting at them. As Lisa�s tension grew higher so Judy bit harder. Finally she
could take it no more. Arching her back she came in wave after wave. Sobbing
with exhaustion and emotion she collapsed back onto the bed.

&nbsp;

Judy lay beside Lisa stroking her gently as
she got her breath back. Then she tenderly removed the shackles and blindfold.
Lisa rolled over to hug her. They locked together, relaxing in each other�s
arms.

&nbsp;

�Come on, it�s shower time.� Judy said at
last.

&nbsp;

�With you?�

&nbsp;

�If you want. But no hanky-panky. We really must get on
with the rest of the day.

&nbsp;

�I could just lie here forever.� Lisa
sighed.

&nbsp;

�So could I, but we can�t. Come on now.�

&nbsp;

The two of them got up and got on with the
day.




When Lisa returned to work on Monday she
had hardly sat down when her team leader came over.

&nbsp;

�You look happy.� He said.

&nbsp;

�Yes, I had a great weekend.�

&nbsp;

�Well don�t get too settled. I�ve just been
told that the Orion project has to be finished in a fortnight. The customer has
changed the deadline.�

&nbsp;

�A fortnight! We�ll never be ready.�

&nbsp;

�Looks like there�s
going to be lots of overtime.�

&nbsp;

For the next two weeks Lisa hardly seemed
to be home at all. Work simply took over. Late into the evenings and all day
Saturday and Sunday Lisa was stuck at work getting the project ready. When she
was home she was too exhausted to do anything other than collapse. Their nights
in bed together held nothing more athletic than a few kisses and cuddles. On
Fridays Judy went out as usual but Lisa was too exhausted to even wonder where
she went. Finally it was over. The boss called them in for a meeting.

&nbsp;

�Well done all of you. Thanks to all the
hard work from this team we managed to meet the deadline. Management are
delighted. As a way of special thanks you�ve all been awarded a bonus. Two hundred pounds each. That�s how much it meant for us to
get the contract. Once again, many thanks.�

&nbsp;

As Lisa and her workmates returned to the
office they were all chatting animatedly. �Lees, what
are you going to spend your bonus on?� One of her workmates asked.

&nbsp;

�I�m not sure.� She replied. She wasn�t
going to tell them what she was thinking of. Two hundred pounds! And
there would be plenty to follow with all the overtime. It had been hard work
but what a windfall at the end of it. When work finished she raced home to tell
Judy.

&nbsp;

�Judy, you know you said a maid�s uniform
would cost around three or four hundred pounds. Well, I think I can afford it
now.� Excitedly she told Judy all about the windfall. �When can I get it? Soon
I hope.�

&nbsp;

�There�s that specialist shop I know. We
could go mail order but it�s much better to make a visit. Why don�t I book a
session? We�ll have to go up to London.�

&nbsp;

�That sounds great. Can we go next
weekend?�

&nbsp;

�I�ll phone up and see.� Judy went off to
the study to get the phone. Lisa could just hear her making the call. After a
few minutes she returned.

&nbsp;

�That�s fine. It�s all booked. They can fit
us in on Saturday.� Lisa wondered slightly why they had to book and why they
had to be fitted in but she left it at that. 

The week seemed to drag by. On Wednesday
Judy gave Lisa a light spanking but nothing serious, just over the knee with a
hair brush. She seemed to be holding herself back. Finally Saturday arrived. At
six-thirty the alarm clock began is shrill tone.

&nbsp;

�Come on sleepyhead.� Judy bounced out of
bed. �You can�t lie there all morning. We�ve got to catch the eight-o-clock to
town.

&nbsp;

Lisa dragged herself out of bed. She wasn�t
good at mornings at the best of times and Judy had kept her up late last night,
kissing and cuddling together. She showered and started to dry herself. As she
did Judy produced the chain again.

&nbsp;

�Come here, I want you to wear this today.�
She fastened the chain around Lisa�s waist as before. Now that Lisa was close
cropped the feeling as it bumped against her was even more intense. Lisa
searched out a dress to wear. Since she had started sharing a bed with Judy
many of her clothes had migrated to Judy�s wardrobe. She chose something light
and simple, something that she�d feel good about being naked underneath. Judy,
she noticed, was choosing more formal clothes. As they were
starting to leave Judy turned to Lisa.

&nbsp;

�Look, I�m going to ask you to trust me
again. Where we are going can be very special. When we get there just go along
with it. You�ll see what I mean. Trust me. OK?� Lisa wondered what on earth she
meant but agreed anyway. Trusting Judy was getting easier and easier.

&nbsp;

Judy drove them down to the station in
plenty of time to catch the train. It was a two hour journey to London so it was
mid morning by the time they arrived at Paddington station. Then they took the
underground right across town ending up somewhere in the east end. Once they
got out of the underground station Lisa could see that they were in an area
full of clothes factories. Most of them were closed on Saturday and the streets
were relatively quiet. Judy led her a few blocks until the arrived at a plain,
unmarked door. She rang the bell and waited. A buzzer sounded and she pushed
the door open. They went in to a dark hallway and up a few stairs. At the top
they were met by a middle aged woman wearing a severe black dress.

&nbsp;

�Judy my friend. So good to see you again. It�s been far to long.� The woman greeted Judy without seeming to notice
Lisa. �Come on in.� 

&nbsp;

�Hello Mary. Thanks for fitting me in.�

&nbsp;

Mary opened a door and led them inside to
the office. As soon as they entered Lisa saw a youngish woman, not much older
than herself, wearing a maid�s outfit like the one she wished to buy. This
woman took her by the arm and led her away.�
Lisa started to protest.

&nbsp;

�Silence. Whilst you are here you are not to speak. Is that understood?�
Mary�s tone was harsh, strident. Lisa was beginning to realise what Judy had
meant about trusting her. Uncertain about what she was getting into she kept
quiet and followed the maid who led her into a small dressing room and started
to undress her. When Lisa tried to help she was slapped away but neither woman
made a sound. When she was naked except for the chain around her waist she was
led over to a sink. The maids filled it with hot water and then, taking a
sponge, started to wash Lisa. The total silence as the maid worked on her, the
matter of fact way in which she was being washed in the most intimate of
places, the way she was forbidden to interact in anyway, gave the proceedings� a surreal
air. Lisa felt as if she was being prepared for some sort of sacrifice. She�d
been stripped, washed and dried and now the maid was brushing her hair,
prettying her up. Curiously she found the whole thing strangely erotic, this
loss of self. Becoming someone who had things done to her rather than someone
who did, an object rather than a person.

&nbsp;

Eventually the maid was finished. She was
led through another door. This opened into a large room with a small stage at
one end. The walls were draped with red velvet and a number of floor standing
full-length mirrors were dotted around. Next to the stage Judy and the Mary sat
in armchairs. 

&nbsp;

The maid led Lisa to the centre of the
stage and Mary got up out of her chair. As she approached Lisa she fetched a
tape measure out of pocked somewhere in her skirt. But before she started to
measure she walked around Lisa inspecting her closely. It seemed that no part
of her body was left un-scrutinised. Lisa imagined it would have been like this
at a slave market. Mary was completely dispassionate. She might as well have
been inspecting a lump of meat. Eventually she took the tape measure and
started measuring. If the inspection had been thorough then so was the
measuring. As she worked Mary called out the figures to the maid who wrote them
down in a little book. Lisa could see her reflection in some of the mirrors and
it heightened the feeling of unreality. Briefly she glanced over at Judy. Mary
saw the look and brutally slapped her face. �Eyes front girl.� Was all she said.

&nbsp;

After a while Mary sat back down with Judy.
They discussed exactly what sort of maid Judy wanted Lisa to be. Apparently the
options ranged from �scullery� to �ladies� depending on the quality of the
clothes involved. Lisa realised she wasn�t going to get any say in the
matter.� Judy decided that �ladies� was
the answer. Mary gave the maid a few orders and she scurried of to complete
them. A few minutes later she returned with a dress rack hung with various
dresses. At the base of the rack was a hamper. Judy and Mary got up from their
chairs and onto the stage. She started picking bits and pieces out of the
hamper. First out was a corset. Judy questioned whether a corset was strictly
accurate for a maid.

&nbsp;

�Oh, on a ladies maid,
quite possible. It would be a �hand-me-down� of
course. Anyway I do feel that they improve a girls
posture. The way this one�s been slouching around she certainly needs one.�

&nbsp;

Mary and the maid fitted the corset. It was
much tighter than the last one she�d worn, and stoutly whaleboned. After that
Lisa could only stand there as various different items were tried, some
discarded, some chosen. There were no zips, of course, and very few buttons,
but plenty of ties. All of it was in serviceable white cotton. Not the lacy
fantasies of the sex shops but the real McCoy. Whilst Mary and Judy discussed
the technicalities of antique clothing in terms Lisa barely understood she felt
herself disappearing under layers of clothing.

&nbsp;

A floor length black dress topped it all
off followed by a starched full length apron and a mop cap. The final piece of
the jigsaw was a pair of serviceable black shoes. Mary and Judy stood back to
get the full effect. Not sexy in the traditional sense but perfectly in tune
with Victorian servitude. Lisa felt dowdy and lumpy but strangely this was far
more erotic than some tarty outfit from a sex shop.

&nbsp;

Mary finally turned to Lisa.

&nbsp;

�Well, girl. What do you say?�

&nbsp;

�Thank you Ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�Curtsey, girl. You�ve forgotten to
curtsey.� Too late Lisa bobbed at the knees. �You have got a lot to learn. Now,
Judy, how about some tea?�

&nbsp;

Lisa followed the maid out to the kitchen.
Lisa found the uniform heavy and restrictive. This was far subtler than the
chain. Whereas the chain gave little reminders with every step this was a
continuous thing using old fashioned stereotypes to reinforce her servility.
Dressed like this she had to be at her mistresses beck
and call. She wanted to ask the maid if she felt the same way but realised that
the regime of total silence forbad it. Together they made the tea. Fortunately
the maid knew exactly what was expected. When the tea was ready the maid handed
the tray to Lisa and led her back to where Mary and Judy were waiting.

&nbsp;

Lisa laid the tray on a small table between
May and Judy, remembered to curtsey, and stood back to wait. Once again their
apparent indifference to her was enforcing her role as servant. She was nothing
to them, a mere minion to be ignored except when needed. Mary and Judy drank
their tea and chatted.

&nbsp;

�I�ve got some new training aids in. Would
you like to see?� Mary asked Judy.

&nbsp;

�Oh, yes please. I�m always on the lookout
for something new.� Judy replied.

&nbsp;

Mary snapped her fingers and the maid came
running over. �Fetch the new bench. Quickly now.� The
maid went to the side of the stage, drew back a curtain and dragged out a
wooden bench. It stood about two feet high, about two feet long and nine inches
wide. Running parallel to the floor, somewhat lower than the top, were two
wooden boards. It looked a bit like a small picnic table except that the
�seats� were considerably longer than the top. It was padded with leather and
festooned with straps. The maid started to lie on it to show how it worked.

&nbsp;

�Not you stupid, the new girl.� Mary
ordered. The maid got up off the bench and went over to Lisa. She took her back
to the bench and guided her down onto it. The top of the bench reached from
Lisa�s neck to just below her waist leaving her groin unimpeded. Her forearms
and calves lay along the �seats� so she was effectively on all fours straddling
it. Then the maid started to fasten the straps. Each arm was held around the
wrist and just below the elbow. The maid ensured that Lisa�s dress wasn�t
trapped as she strapped Lisa�s calves at the ankle and just below the knee.
Already Lisa couldn�t move but there was more to come. Three straps, one just
below her arms, one about the level of her breasts, and one around the waist
held her body firmly to the top crushing her on to it. Her dress was lifted and
her underwear lowered to expose her bottom. Mary and Judy came up onto the
stage and stood next to the bench. She felt a hand on her bottom and something
cold squeezed into the crack. Some sort of cream was being spread around her
sphincter. An unknown hand rubbed it in probing every crevice. She couldn�t
suppress a gasp as she felt a finger penetrate her, pushing through the tight
puckered ring. The finger pushed and turned spreading the cream deep inside
her.

&nbsp;

�She�s very tight. I think we�ll start with
a smallish one.� She heard Mary say. A hand reached between her legs and she
felt a strap pulled from the bottom of the bench up between her thighs. Again
she felt something probing at her sphincter, something wider and blunter than a
finger, a dildo perhaps? Harder and firmer it was pushed against her until it
slipped inside. She felt her sphincter spread as the dildo was pushed deep
inside her. The strap was then drawn up, over her bunched dress and fastened
against the strap around her waist. As it was tightened she felt fingers
probing deep between her thighs, spreading her so the strap lay between her
labia. Then it was pulled as taught as possible, hard against her clitoris and
forcing the dildo inside he until it seemed to fill
her backside. Only the way in which it was fastened to the strap stopped the
dildo from disappearing altogether inside her. Lisa could only imagine what she
must look like, constrained, violated and helpless.

&nbsp;

�We have a number of correctional
instruments. Perhaps you would like to try a few.� Mary asked.

&nbsp;

�Thank you. That would be splendid. I�ll
start with this one.

&nbsp;

�The tawse. Good choice, it does so well against a well padded bottom. Not that
there�s much flesh here of course.� Lisa could suppress a yelp as two strokes
slashed across her. Next Judy tried a paddle, nothing like as severe as the
tawse but with a satisfying thwack as she struck. After each instrument Lisa
felt fingers stroking her bottom tracing out the marks that� lay there. Different weights and sizes
were tried and Judy and Mary discussed their various merits calmly. It was as
if they were discussing something as mundane as tennis rackets, comparing
weight, swing and effect. Lisa could only lie there and take it. She squirmed
in pain, or as much as the straps would allow. This only seemed to increase the
pressure of the strap against her clitoris. Between gasps her breathing was
fast and shallow. She was starting to sob. The intensity and variety of
feelings and emotions was getting to her. Finally Mary and Judy seem to come to
an agreement.

&nbsp;

�Right. That one then. Would you like to be
serviced while you watch?� Mary asked.

&nbsp;

�Thank you, you�re so kind.� Judy replied.

&nbsp;

Looking up she watched in the various
mirrors as Judy returned her chair. Before she sat down she lifted her skirt.
Lisa watched as the maid knelt down in front of her and� buried her head between Judy�s thighs.
She felt her humiliation was complete. She was a show, a spectacle to be
enjoyed whilst Judy was pleasured by another woman. She let her head hang down
again.

&nbsp;

Thwack! Mary started to leather Lisa�s
bottom. Lisa guessed she must be using one of the paddles. The pain wasn�t as
sharp as the cane or the tawse had been but that didn�t mean it was gentle.
Methodically Mary worked first one buttock and then the other. Lisa bucked
against the pain which only seemed to emphasise the tightness of the straps.
She felt herself dissolving in a maelstrom of feelings. Vaguely, as if through
a mist, she could hear Judy groaning in ecstasy. It was all too much, she
wanted it to stop, she didn�t want it to stop, what she wanted didn�t seem to
matter any more. She felt her muscles spasm as the strap against her clitoris
did its stuff and she climaxed again and again.

&nbsp;

Suddenly it was over. The room was silent
except for Lisa sobbing gently. She felt limp and used as she tried to make her
muscles relax. After a pause she heard distant footsteps leaving the room and a
door closing. Then busy fingers began to undo the straps. The last strap
undone, Lisa stood up shaking and unsteady. The maid led Lisa back to the
dressing room and helped her out of the uniform. It was packed away neatly and
Lisa was offered a shower. 

&nbsp;

As the warm water cascaded over her she
felt as if she were returning to normal. Her backside was bruised and raw, her
sphincter felt stretched and sore but inside she felt elated. She felt like she
had passed some sort of test and now she could stay here in the shower forever.
After a while though she realised she really must get back to the real world.

&nbsp;

The maid handed her a towel. Obviously the
�can�t do anything for herself� phase was over
although it was still done in complete silence. The maid remained with her and
helped her get dressed in her street clothes. When she was finished the maid
led her back to the office where they had entered.

&nbsp;

Suddenly everything was completely normal.
Mary showed her an itemised bill and Lisa sorted out her credit card as if it
were any other transaction. It was as if the red draped room had never
happened. The maid handed Lisa the outfit wrapped in a suithanger.

&nbsp;

�Lovely to see you as
always. Don�t forget this.� Mary handed a small
package to Judy. �Anytime you want anything do let me know.�

&nbsp;

�Of course. It�s always a pleasure shopping here.� Judy turned to Lisa. �Right,
we must be off.� The two women left the shop and walked out into the sunshine.
Amazingly it was still lunchtime. Judy took Lisa to a nearby� pub to find something to eat. After
they had ordered at the bar they found a� quiet corner to sit and chat. Luckily
the seats were quite soft. Even so Lisa had trouble sitting still.

&nbsp;

�Well, you got your outfit. I hope it�s
what you wanted.�

&nbsp;

�It�s fantastic and so was� what was that
place.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, I discovered Mary�s some time back. So useful for so many things. What did you think of the
service?� Judy had a light mocking tone.

&nbsp;

�Wow. It was amazing. I�ve never felt
anything so intense. But you�ll have to lay off me for a while. My poor bottom!
I must be black and blue.�

&nbsp;

�I know, poor thing. Mary does nothing by
halves. So much better than mail order, don�t you agree?�

&nbsp;

�You can say that again! By the way, Judy��

&nbsp;

�Yes my pet?�

&nbsp;

�That thing up my bottom, when we get home
can we try that again?�

&nbsp;

�Certainly.� Judy smiled to herself.� By the way I�ve got some other surprises
for you.�

&nbsp;

�What? What have you got?�

&nbsp;

Judy picked up the package that Mary had
given her as they left. Holding it below the level of the table so it was
hidden from the rest of the pub she opened it up. Inside was a white leather
collar, lighter and more delicate than Christine�s but still with chromed metal
loops attached, still very much a slave�s collar.

&nbsp;

�This is my present to you for being so
brave in there. A pretty little collar for my pretty little
slave. No slave is complete without one. Take a look.�

&nbsp;

Discretely Lisa took the collar and
examined it. Like Christine�s it had a dog tag. Lisa red the
inscription - �Judy�s Pet Slave�. 

&nbsp;

�Thank you, thank you so much.� She leaned
over and kissed Judy lightly on the cheek.

&nbsp;

�You can thank me properly when we get
home. I haven�t put it on you yet, that�s for a special moment. Put it away
now, here comes our food.�

&nbsp;

To be continued�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;














It was Sunday afternoon and Lisa was bored

It was Sunday afternoon
and Lisa was bored. Yesterday they�d been to London to buy her maid�s uniform but now Judy wouldn�t
let her wear it. She went on about waiting until the time was right. Worse
still, she wouldn�t give Lisa the collar she�d bought either. She�d said she
was saving it for a special occasion and that Lisa would understand when the
time came. Lisa realised she was being unfair and petulant but that didn�t make
her feel any better about it. Damn it, she�d just spent the thick end of four hundred
pounds on the outfit and she wanted to play now.

&nbsp;

Judy had settled down
with the Sunday papers leaving Lisa to mooch around the house. She tried the
television but there was nothing worth watching. She flicked through some
magazines but none seemed to hold her attention. She wandered over to the
bookshelves to see if there was anything to read. She couldn�t find anything
she fancied but there, on the top shelf, were the photo albums. She thought
about taking a second look. Last time she�d been too shocked, too amazed to
really take it all in. Now she�d been educated a bit maybe she could appreciate
them more. However, she knew better than to take them down without asking.

&nbsp;

�Judy?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, pet?� Judy looked
up from the newspaper.

&nbsp;

�Do you mind if I look
at your photo albums? You know the ones I mean.�

&nbsp;

�OK. Don�t get too excited or I�ll have to sort you
out later.�

Lisa wondered if that was a threat or a promise. Maybe it
was both. She went back to the bookshelves, took down the albums, and laid them
out on the table. This time she took more care as she studied the photos. She
was struck by the variety and imagination of the positions and methods used for
punishment. One showed three girls from behind. They were chained together at
the ankles and bent double so what you saw was three sets of spread legs and
three beautifully caned bottoms. Gradually Lisa started to wonder about the
number of different women shown. She�d recognised Christine and Judy but there
must have been around a dozen different women in total and it seemed like every
possible permutation was there. The ages seemed to vary from around Lisa�s age
to much older. Naturally some women were normally in dominant roles and others
submissive but it wasn�t as simple as that. She even found one of Judy, her
head buried between another woman�s thighs as a third woman serviced her with a
large vibrator. This wasn�t the dominant Judy she knew. In fact the album posed
more questions than it answered. Curiosity got the better of her.

�Judy?�

�Ummm?� 

�Who are these women? I know you and Christine but who are
all the others?�

Judy put down her newspaper, came over and sat beside her. 

�Well, that�s Sally, that�s Jane and that�s, let me see,
Susan.�

��That�s not quite
what I meant.� Lisa replied. �I mean, how do you know them all? Have they all
been your lovers?�

�No, it�s nothing like that. I was going to tell you sooner
or later and now seems as good a time as any. There�s a group of people I know,
all girls, all with the same interests and we like to get together from time to
time and play. I told you I like playing with lots of different partners and,
well, that�s what we do. I was going to take you along sometime soon but I
wasn�t sure you were ready. You know how jealous you can get.�

�How did you meet them all?�

�Oh, here and there. Christine you know about. From time to time we
meet someone new and, if we�re sure she�s suitable, we invite her along. For
obvious reasons we�ve got to be careful. It�s not just the blackmail aspect, there are all sorts of issues about levels of
consent and things like that to be sure about.�

�Where do you meet?�

�Charlotte�s got a pretty big place and sometimes we meet here. The
playroom�s big enough for all of us. So, what do you think?�

��I think you�re
rotten for not telling me about this earlier!� Lisa pouted. A thought struck
her. �I know, that�s where you go on Fridays.�

�That�s right.�

�And will you be going next Friday?�

�Of course. And you? Do you want to come?�

There was a long pause. Lisa looked back at the photos.
Nowadays she wasn�t as shocked as she had been about having sex with strangers.
After all she�d been paddled by Mary within minutes of meeting her. Her
nervousness gave way to excitement as she thought over all the possibilities
and if she was to be part of Judy�s life she might as well be part of all of
it, especially this bit.

��I�d love to.� She
said at last.

Judy leaned across and gave her a hug. 

�Great. Why don�t I phone Charlotte and suggest that we host the meeting next
Friday? It�s been a while now since I did. It�s not really fair on Charlotte to host week in, week out.�

Judy went to the phone and dialled. 

�Hi, Charlotte, it�s Judy. About next Friday, It looks like I can host
after all. � Yes, that�s right, I�ve told her and she�s agreed. �� You�ll tell the others then? � Great. See you at seven.�

��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������She
put down the phone and came back to the table. 

�So, how do you like my photos now? Do they still turn you
on?

��What happens on
Fridays?� Lisa asked avoiding Judy�s question. Now that it was all set she was wondering
what she was letting herself in for.

��We start with a
light buffet supper and afterwards we play for a while. Look, I don�t want to
tell you too much; it will ruin the surprise. Don�t worry,
we all know the stop word. Trust me?�

There was that trust word again. Twice before Judy had
asked Lisa to trust her and each occasion had ended in a wild sex scene. Lisa
did trust Judy, she was warm, she was comforting, she was strong, she was her lover. How could she not trust her?

The rest of the week seemed to drag by for Lisa. On
Thursday night as they lay in bed together she snuggled up to Judy.

�Judy, about tomorrow, you will look after me, won�t you?�

��Still
nervous? Don�t worry. You�ll be fine. All the others have been dying to
meet you. It�s been awhile since anyone new joined us. Now come here and give
me a kiss.� Locked in each others arms the two women drifted off to sleep.

Friday arrived at last. Judy picked Lisa up from work to
ensure she got home as early as possible. The boot of the car was full of
shopping and Lisa carried the bags in as Judy started to lay out the buffet. It
didn�t take long before the kitchen worktops were covered with dishes. Judy put
some white wine in the fridge and opened a couple of bottles of red to let them
breathe. She looked up at the clock.

�Look at the time! Come on, we need to get dressed, they�ll
be here at seven and, believe me, you don�t want to keep Charlotte waiting.� They went upstairs and got out of
their street clothes. Whilst showering together Judy was strictly business. Lisa saw that she was nervous about being late.
After drying they helped each other dress. This was, after all, the first time
Lisa had put on her maids outfit by herself and she needed lots of help.
Furthermore, lacing up corsets is best done by someone other than the wearer.

At five to seven they were finally ready. Judy whisked
round the lounge making sure all was as she wanted it. Lisa went to the kitchen
to remove the Clingfilm from the platters they had prepared.

The doorbell went and Lisa hurried off to answer it. Two
women entered. The first was a tall imperious woman in her late forties. She
looked like the headmistress of one of the better all girl schools, the type
that calls itself an Academy. The figure behind her was almost lost in a hooded
cloak.� She was being led by a chain that
came from somewhere around her neck.

��Charlotte. Good to see you.� Judy arrived to greet her
guests. Lisa helped Charlotte off with her coat. Without a backwards glance Charlotte
and Judy returned to the lounge. After hanging up Charlotte�s coat Lisa turned to the other figure. As she
removed the cloak Lisa�s jaw dropped in amazement. It revealed a woman, maybe
Judy�s age or a little older, but the thing that made Lisa gape was that she
was totally naked except for a network of leather straps around her body. The
straps seemed to centre on a wide tight belt and they covered neither her
breasts nor her groin. The chain, which was actually a dog lead, was attached
to a wide leather collar. As Lisa stared she noticed that the woman�s labia
were pierced with two strong rings, one on either side, held together by a
small padlock.

�Hi. I�m Sally. You must be Lisa. I�ve been dying to meet
you. It�s about time Judy met someone special. Come on through. If we don�t get
the drinks sorted we�ll be in trouble.� Sally went into the kitchen and Lisa
followed. Sally seemed to know where everything was and soon sorted out two
glasses of wine on a tray. Leaving Lisa dumbfounded in her wake she took the
tray through to the lounge. She had hardly left before the doorbell went again.

Once more Lisa opened the door to find two women standing
there. Once more it was obvious which was the dominant
partner. The first figure to enter was dressed in a very masculine suit.
Her dark hair was cut short and she wore a shirt and tie. The cut of her suit
however didn�t hide the curves that showed she was a woman, albeit in very
manly attire. She strode past Lisa as if she wasn�t there and went into the
lounge. Behind her was a woman in her thirties dressed, like Lisa, in a plain,
traditional maids outfit. She came up to Lisa and kissed her on the cheek.

�Lovely to meet you. I�m Jane. Are we the first?�

�No, Charlotte and Sally are here.�

�Come on then, I�m in enough grief as it is. If I don�t get
Ruth her drink soon I�ll be in even more trouble.� They hurried to the kitchen.
Once again Jane seemed to know her way around. She poured a glass of wine for
Ruth and took it through. As she left for the lounge Sally re-appeared. 

��I love your uniform.
It looks great on you. Quite the demure little maid.
Do I detect Mary�s fair hand?�

�Yes, we went up to London last weekend. An amazing place,
isn�t it.�

��You can say that
again! Did you get the special treatment?�

��Yes, the journey
home was distinctly uncomfortable. I never knew train seats could be so hard.�
The doorbell rang again.

��That will be Susan
and Christine. You answer the door, I�ll see if the bosses are OK.�

Lisa went to the door. She wasn�t too sure about how she
felt about meeting Christine again. There was still some jealousy left from
last time and Christine had promised revenge for the flogging. Still, she
couldn�t back out now. When she opened the door she saw a woman she presumed to
be Susan dressed in an Edwardian gown not dissimilar to Judy�s except it was in
a deep dark blue. Behind her, being led on a lead, was
Christine wearing the same yellow dress as last time. Unlike the others Susan
stopped and looked Lisa up and down.

�So you�re the one with the strong right arm.� She mocked.
�My poor little pet was quite sore for a while.�

�I�m sorry.� Lisa stammered.

�Oh don�t be, I�m sure she deserved it. She can be quite
the little minx at times. She often needs the attention of a strong right arm,
don�t you?�

��Yes,
Ma�am.� Christine replied. Lisa was pleased to see that she seemed quite
meek behind Susan.

Susan smiled at Lisa. �I�m sure I�ll be seeing a lot more
of you later.� She turned and headed for the lounge.

It almost seemed that there were two parties going on. One in the lounge, one in the kitchen. Not that the kitchen
crowd had much time to chat, they were kept busy handing round plates and
making sure glasses were replenished. In the kitchen Lisa found the others very
open and friendly. She was fast making friends, even with Christine. However,
the somewhat unusual mode of dress and a general air of sexual tension gave the
occasion a bizarre atmosphere. Lisa found she was often staring at Sally�s
padlock, wondering what it was like to wear. It wasn�t long before Sally noticed.

�Do you like it?� She asked with a smile. �I got it done to
mark our fifth anniversary. Do you want to have a closer look?� She sat up on
the table and spread her thighs. Lisa was fascinated. 

��You can touch it if
you want to.� Sally took Lisa�s hand and led it to her groin. Lisa found that
the rings were quite sturdy and the padlock, although small, was no mere toy.
She wondered what it must feel like to have the weight constantly pulling at
her lips and whether it had hurt to get it done.

�Charlotte keeps the key. Sometimes she has me locked for days. It�s
quite a thrill wearing it out and about, knowing that I�m locked and waiting
for her to free me.�

��You said your fifth
anniversary? You and Charlotte have been together for five years?�

�It�s more like ten now. She�s been wonderful to me. I
don�t know what I�d do without her. She�s very special.� They heard the sound
of a hand bell being rung in the lounge. �Quick, that�s the bell. Come on, we
mustn�t keep them waiting.� They rushed to the lounge and stood next to Jane
and Christine who were waiting demurely by the door.

��Right, ladies, it�s
time for business.� Lisa wasn�t surprised that Charlotte seemed to be in charge. �Let�s go to the
playroom.�

They all went down to the playroom. Judy had provided three
other chairs arranged next to the throne. Again Lisa wasn�t surprised when Charlotte headed straight toward it. She was obviously in
charge tonight. As well as being the eldest she had a natural air of authority.
Not that age seemed to make much difference. Ruth wasn�t much older than Lisa
and her dominance over the much older Jane was obvious. Lisa, Jane, Sally and
Christine stood waiting. The tension in the room was electric. 

��Jones, come forward
girl.� Lisa went and stood in front of the throne.

�Knees!� Lisa realised her mistake and dropped to her knees.

Charlotte leaned forward and lifted Lisa�s chin

�Tonight is a special night because you are to become
Judy�s slave. You are to be her property, her possession, her plaything. Your
sole purpose will be to do her bidding, to serve her and to worship her. Do you
agree to commit yourself to this?� 

�Yes, Madam.� Despite feeling that Charlotte was going over the top her words had a powerful
erotic charge. As much as part of her knew that in the �real� world she and
Judy were partners whose relationship was based on a growing bond of love and
respect, here in the �play� world she was losing her identity, becoming
nothing, a toy to be used or discarded. 

Judy got up from her chair. In her hand she held the collar
she had bought from Mary�s. Attached to it was a matching dog lead. She stood
in front of Lisa and, stooping slightly, slipped the collar around Lisa�s neck.
Unlike a dog�s collar this one didn�t fasten with a buckle, rather the two ends
were finished with metal loops held together by a padlock. The click of the
padlock must have been quite quiet but Lisa heard it clear as day. Although
this was just a game, a play for pleasure, she knew her relationship with Judy
would never be the same again. In her mind she would always be wearing this
collar.

��Well, what do you
say?�

��Thank you, Miss. Thank you for the collar. It is a privilege to
be yours.� Although, on one level, Lisa was just playing along, on another she
felt she really meant it. The line between play-acting and reality was getting
blurred. She really was happy to be here, kneeling at the feet of her mistress.

��Very
pretty.� Charlotte spoke from the throne. �Now to demonstrate that
if you belong to one you belong to all I think twelve strokes of the cane is in
order. That�s three strokes from each of us. Girls, get this one properly
arranged.�

Christine and Jane hurried forward and lifted Lisa to her
feet. Meanwhile Sally fetched the horse and set it up in the centre of the
room. With three of them helping it wasn�t long before Lisa was once more
strapped over the horse. Busy hands reached up under her dress and found two
laces hanging down from her corset. The back of her dress was rolled up and the
two laces tied off to loops at her belt. This left her legs and buttocks
exposed. Her underwear was pulled down, draped around her spread knees. Once
again she was open, exposed and vulnerable. Judy, as first to go, fetched a
cane from the wall and approached the horse but before she started she crouched
down next to Lisa�s head.

��I love you. Be
brave, my sweet.� She whispered. Lisa felt a thrill pass through her. Judy
loved her, now she would do anything, suffer anything, to be worthy of that
love. Judy walked round the horse and took aim. One, two, three searing bands
of pain swept across Lisa�s buttocks. She bit on her lip to keep it all in. She
would be brave, she would be.

Susan was next. Again three strokes.
Lisa�s buttocks felt like they were on fire. When she had finished it was
Ruth�s turn. Lisa glanced up as she approached. There was a glint in Ruth�s
eye, much harder than Judy or Susan. At the first of Ruth�s strokes Lisa lost
control. She struck much harder than either Judy or Susan. The pain was almost
beyond bearing. Lisa howled as the second and third strokes threatened to cut
her in half. There was barely a break before it was Charlotte�s turn. Like Ruth she showed no mercy. Lisa
could but howl in agony. Only her desire to be good enough for Judy stopped her
screaming the stop word.

At last it stopped. Lisa hung there limp and exhausted.
She�d made it! She�d proved herself. But it wasn�t over yet.

�Such a pretty little arse. Do you mind if I�?� Ruth asked Judy.

��No, no. Go ahead.�
Judy replied. As Ruth lowered her trousers and fitted a strap-on Judy once
again crouched down by Lisa�s head. She lifted it up and started to kiss away
the tears. Lisa was vaguely aware of lubricating jelly being smeared around her
sphincter. Then she felt Ruth pushing at her, overcoming the initial resistance,
forcing the strap-on inside her. Any cries that Lisa might have made were
smothered by kisses from Judy. Ruth continued with firm even strokes. Despite
with generous lubrication Lisa felt as if she were being split asunder but she
had gone to a place somewhere beyond pain, lost in the intensity of the
emotions. Judy had stopped kissing her and was whispering in her ear.

��You like that,
don�t you? You like having a strap-on up your arse. You like serving me by
serving Ruth. Shall I play with you? Shall I make you come?�

�Please, oh yes, oh please!� Lisa managed to reply.

Judy reached her arm back, under the horse and, burrowing
under the folds of Lisa�s dress found her legs. She then traced her way up
searching for the groin. Finding it she started to rub Lisa keeping time with
Ruth. As the tempo increased Lisa once again became lost, there was so much to
feel. Her face was now buried in Judy�s shoulder and, in her heightened state, she became aware of Judy�s perfume. So many
conflicting feelings, she felt as if she would explode, the pain from her
buttocks, the strap-on inside her, Judy�s fingers busy at her point of
pleasure, it was all too much, it was all toooooo�� Wave upon wave upon wave of intensity washed
through her, every muscle clenched as one and, overcome at last, she blacked
out for a while.

When Lisa came to she was sat on the floor being cuddled by
Judy. Gradually the room stopped swirling and she gladly took the glass of
water offered by unknown hands.

�Are you Ok?� Judy was pure concern. �Are you alright,
little one.�

��Yes, yes, I�m
fine.� Lisa was exhausted. She felt like a used dishrag but it had all been
worth it. Never before had she felt anything so intense, so powerful, so all consuming. Her whole rear end was a ball of fire but it
had been worth it, worth it to feel this way. Judy helped Lisa to her feet and
guided her to a chair at the edge of the room. Lisa sat down gingerly. Her raw
bottom was uncomfortable against the cloth of the chair but her legs were still
too unsteady to stay standing. The evening�s entertainment wasn�t over but Lisa
would be a spectator from now on.

Charlotte then told the others that Ruth had some
outstanding business with Jane. Lisa didn�t catch the exact details and guessed
that they weren�t the point anyway. They decide to use the T-bar, whatever that
was. Lisa watched as Christine and Sally brought out another strange
contraption. It looked like a leather log, about nine inches in diameter, with
a cross piece attached at one end. The other end rested on a trestle about
three feet from the floor. The ends of the crosspiece were hung from chains
which ran through hooks in the ceiling. Most sinister of all was a dildo,
attached like a vicious hook, near the trestle end.

Christine and Sally helped Jane out of her dress, chemise,
petticoats and bloomers. She was then laid along the length of the log and her
wrists strapped to the ends of the crosspiece. As the chains tightened it rose
up so until the log was steeply angled. Even with her wrists strapped tight,
Jane began to slide down the log towards the dildo. Lisa could see Jane hanging
on tight to hold herself up. As she started to slip backwards Charlotte guided her down onto the dildo. With a grunt
Jane relaxed her grip and slipped the last few inches, impaled by the
contraption. Ruth and Susan, each holding a paddle, then took position, one
either side. As they set to Jane began to squirm against the log. Although she
was obviously suffering, the growing redness of her buttocks a telling
testimony, she was equally obviously turned on by the log and the dildo rubbing
against her. She was pulling against the cross bar, grunting rhythmically,
easing herself up and down, up and down. As Ruth and Susan increased the tempo
so did Jane. Her grunts turned to animal cries, to shouts until with a cry of
�YES, YES,YES� she climaxed and collapsed.

As she was released Jane fell to the floor and shuffled
over to Ruth.

��Thank you,
Mistress. Thank you.�� She hugged Ruth�s
legs.

Once again Charlotte addressed the group. �Now ladies, it�s
lottery time. Lisa, Ruth and Jane have had their fun so it�s five balls in the
bag.� 

Judy handed went over to a bench where she picked up a
black velvet bag and put five balls in it. She handed it to Charlotte who
passed it round the group, each taking a ball in turn.

�I�ve got number one.� Christine almost squeaked with
excitement.

�And I�ve got number five.� Charlotte said ruefully. �How do you want me?�

��Well, Miss High and Mighty, off with those clothes for a start.� Charlotte began to undress as Christine arranged some
shackles hanging from the ceiling by a chain. Judy came over and sat beside
Lisa to watch the show.

�What�s going on?� asked Lisa.

�We always end like this, it adds a bit of spice. Whoever
gets the number one ball gets to do whatever they please with whoever gets the
highest number. It helps mix the group up a bit.�

As Charlotte disrobed she revealed that she was also in old-fashioned
underwear, this time 50�s style. Christine stopped her when she was down to her
corset and stockings.

��That will do.� She
fetched a leg spreader and attached it to Charlotte�s ankles. Then she fastened the shackles to Charlotte�s wrists and adjusted the chain so that Charlotte�s body was held taught between floor and
ceiling. 

��Very
pretty.� Christine stood face to face with Charlotte, reached down and began to play with her. �What
shall we do now?� she mused.

It was apparent that Charlotte was already aroused; she was squirming against
Christine�s hand and had a far away look in her eyes. Christine played with her
for a while and then withdrew her hand. She licked her fingers thoughtfully.

��The flogger, I
think.� She went and fetched one from where they hung on the wall. She returned
and slowly started to circle Charlotte. From time to time she would flick a stroke at the hanging
figure. Sometimes on her thighs, sometimes on her buttocks,
sometimes on her breasts. The more Charlotte became aroused the more Christine upped the
tempo. Charlotte�s gasps grew more and more urgent. Suddenly Christine
stood back and stopped.

�That�s got you nicely warmed up. Sally? Would you do the
honours, please?�

Sally needed no second urging. She scooted down in front of
Charlotte and started kissing her groin. She started at
the tops of the thighs kissing in a line back and forward across the upper edge
of Charlotte�s pubic hair. Charlotte�s haughty demeanour had already slipped but
with this merciless teasing the animal inside was being released. In vain she
thrust herself forward, twisting and squirming, trying to get Sally where she
wanted her, where she needed her. Sally grasped her thighs to hold her steady.

�You see, you�re just as randy as the rest of us.�
Christine mocked. �You need to come don�t you?�

�Yes, yes please.�

�Yes, please what?�

�Yes please, I need to come.�

Christine returned to the flogging but this time she
concentrated on the buttocks. Sally took this as her cue to concentrate on the
centre of Charlotte�s pleasure. In moments her grunts turned to
moans, turned to cries. Whether they were cries of pain or pleasure, or maybe
both, Lisa could only speculate. Sally hands gripped tighter, her nails digging
into Charlotte�s flesh.

��Oh please! Oh
please! Ohhh, Sally� Charlotte gasped, went rigid and then limp. The chain was
released and she collapsed to the floor in a heap with Sally.

Whilst Charlotte was resting Christine went over to the throne and sat
down.

�Now come here and thank me.� She ordered when Charlotte had recovered.

Charlotte, hampered by the leg spreader and shackled
wrists, struggled across the floor. As she approached Christine lifted her
dress and Charlotte buried her head beneath it. Christine reached
down and grabbed Charlotte�s head, pulling it into her. 

�Harder, harder, yes there! Come on, bitch, lick me!�
Christine�s passion was intense and urgent. �Yes! Yes! Yessss��

As Christine came she pushed Charlotte to the floor and flung herself back in the
throne. For a few moments there was silence. Then Christine crouched down
beside Charlotte and kissed her long and hard. Breaking the kiss
at last she released Charlotte from her chains.

�Well, I don�t know about you but I could do with a drink.�
Charlotte told the group as she stood back up. They all returned to the lounge
and settled down with fresh glasses of wine. Now the atmosphere was completely
different. The tension had gone and, although there was a definite sexual
frisson in the air, mistress and slave relaxed together as equals. Charlotte
and Jane were still mostly undressed and Lisa still had her dress rolled up
behind her. Sally was curled up on Charlottes� lap as Charlotte idly played
with the padlock between her legs. Apart from that it could have been any group
of women relaxing together.

Later, after they had seen the last couple out, Judy came
up to Lisa an hugged her.

�Well, my sweet, how are you feeling?�

��Ready for bed. Can
we clear up in the morning?�

��Of course. But
that�s not what I meant, and you know it. How do you feel now you�re a member
of the club?�

�That was amazing. I�m not sure I could do it every time
but�� Words failed her. 

�I know. It can all be a bit much first time and we didn�t
go easy on you, did we? Anyway, who says it will be your turn next week?�

�That�s true.� Lisa replied. �But what about you? What
about Sally and Susan? It seems a bit unfair. I just had the most fantastic
orgasm and you�ve had nothing.�

��My turn will come,
maybe next week, maybe the week after. You�ll have to learn to take your turn.
Anyway, if you�re so concerned about me why don�t we go to bed and you can do
something about it?�

�Oooh, yes please.� And hand in
hand they went off upstairs.

To be continued�














Lisa and Judy were relaxing in front of the television when the

Saturday morning sunlight streamed through the gaps in the
curtains. Lisa rolled over and reached out for Judy. Her hand found only empty
sheets. As ever her lover was up and about. Lisa wished she�d stay in bed
awhile. Sometimes the early morning cuddles were the best. She rolled over and
winced as the bruises on her buttocks reminded her of how extreme last night
had been. She smiled to herself, she�d passed the test, she was now officially
Judy�s. Reaching to her throat she fingered the collar that was still there.
Last night, while they were undressing, Lisa had spent some time in front of
the mirror. She loved the feel of it; she loved the look of it against her
neck. White was so much more feminine than the dark brown or black of Christine
and Sally�s collars. Wearing it made her feel like a little girl, Judy�s little
girl. Drowsy and still half asleep she was just rolling over for five more
minutes when Judy appeared at the door with a breakfast tray.

&nbsp;

��Good morning,
sleepyhead. How are you today? How�s that pretty little bottom of yours?�
Accepting a cup of coffee and a plate of toast Lisa scooted over to make room
for Judy to get in beside her. Over breakfast they discussed plans for the day,
shops they needed to visit, places they needed to go.

&nbsp;

��Enough chat. It�s
time for action.� Judy wiped away the last few toast crumbs with a serviette
and got out of bed. �Come on, it�s shower time. Let me get that collar and
chain off you.�

&nbsp;

�Judy?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, pet.�

&nbsp;

��Can I keep the
chain?� Lisa played with the medallion that hung from her waist.

�If you want. Here�s the key.�

&nbsp;

�No, I don�t mean like that. I�d like to keep it on me,
always.�

&nbsp;

�Are you sure?�

&nbsp;

�Yes. I�ve thought it through. I can tuck the end in my
knickers when we�re not playing. Nobody but you and I would know. Please, I
really want to.�

&nbsp;

�I�d be delighted if you kept it.� Judy got back onto the
bed and kissed Lisa, long and hard. �You�re my very special girl. I love you
lots and lots and I�m honoured that you want to wear my chain. Thank you. But we
had better remove that collar. Much as I think you look sweet with it on, it
would raise a few eyebrows around town.�

&nbsp;

Judy gave Lisa one last kiss and unlocked the collar. She
took it to her dressing table and put it away. The key to the padlock that held
Lisa�s chain glinted in her hand. She was just about to put it in her jewellery
box when a thought struck her. If Lisa was keeping the chain then the key
should stay with her. She threaded it onto her key ring. It looked a bit out of
place beside her house keys but that was fine. It was her half of the bargain
and she�d carry it always. As she got up from the dressing table she noticed
Lisa still under the covers. 

�Come on, lazy bones! Up and at em! If you don�t hurry
you�ll be showering alone.� Lisa couldn�t ignore a threat like that so she
jumped out of bed and followed Judy into the en suite.

&nbsp;

A week or so later Lisa and Judy were spending the evening
in front of the television when the phone went. Judy answered it but soon
passed it over to Lisa.

&nbsp;

�Hello � Hi! Babes! Wow! How are you? � Yes, I got the job
and I�m settled here in Bristol � When? Next weekend? Hang on a min. I�ll just
check.� Lisa turned to Judy.

&nbsp;

�It�s Abebi, a friend of mine from college. She�s visiting
Bristol next weekend, can she come and stay? Please?�

&nbsp;

�Of course, it will be nice to meet some of your friends
for a change. We can put her in the spare room.�

&nbsp;

�Babes, it�s fine. I�ll give you the address.� Lisa
finalised arrangements and put the phone down. �Wow! I haven�t seen Babes since
we graduated. She�s living in Cambridge now doing post-graduate work. She
always was a bit of a swot. I�m really looking forward to seeing her.�

&nbsp;

�Abebi, that�s an interesting name. Where does she get it
from?�

&nbsp;

�Oh her family is from Ghana. They emigrated here in the
sixties. I just call her Babes.�

&nbsp;

�So I gathered. Lisa?� Judy was suddenly serious. �How much
do you want her to know? About us I mean. I realise she�s your friend and all,
but coming out isn�t always easy. If you want to keep our relationship quiet
I�ll understand. I can be a landlady for the weekend.�

&nbsp;

Lisa was dumbstruck. She hadn�t thought of that. On the one
hand she had never kept any secrets from Babes, they�d been close all through
three years of college. It would also be almost a betrayal of Judy, to deny
their love, to hide it away. On the other hand she wasn�t sure what Babes would
think. Sure, she was pretty open-minded but this was major. Lisa was racked by
indecision.

&nbsp;

�Can we just play it by ear? I mean, I really don�t know.
I�m not sure what I want to do.�

&nbsp;

�Of course we can. Come here.� Lisa came over and, led by
Judy, snuggled down on her lap. �Coming out is a big step, even to your closest
friends. I do understand, after all, I�ve been there myself.�

&nbsp;

Lisa rested her head on Judy�s shoulder as Judy stroked her
hair. This felt so right, so natural, so easy that it would be wrong to deny
it, but what if Abebi didn�t understand? What if it ruined their friendship?
What if� What if�

&nbsp;

�We�ll have to make the bed up in your old room as well.
That way all the options are open.� As ever Judy was being practical. Lisa
thought about sleeping alone again. She�d got used to having Judy�s body next
to hers, to having kisses and cuddles on tap. When a recent business trip had
kept Judy away for the night the bed had felt empty and lonely. Still, she�d
have to take it one day at a time.

&nbsp;

Abebi was due to arrive on Saturday morning. The night
before Judy and Lisa had gone to Charlotte�s and Lisa, having lost the
�lottery�, had received twelve strokes of the cane from Sally, who had won.
However, she was used to getting up on Saturday morning with marks from the
night before and thought nothing of it. Similarly tucking the medallion in her
panties was becoming second nature to her, an everyday part of getting dressed.
After all she only let it hang when Judy demanded it.

&nbsp;

Around eleven a taxi pulled up outside and Abebi got out.
Judy watched from the study window as Lisa, who had been waiting and watching,
rushed down the drive to meet her. Abebi was tall with dark ebony skin. She was
wearing a short skirt and a tight tee shirt that showed off her figure. It was
Judy�s turn to feel a stab of jealousy. What would Lisa want with an old bat
like her when she had such beautiful friends of her own age? She went out into
the hall to greet her guest. 

&nbsp;

Over a light lunch the three women chatted together, or at
least Lisa and Abebi did. Judy could hardly get a word in edgeways and felt
left out as the two girls discussed plans for the afternoon.

&nbsp;

�Come on, Lees, a big town like this must have plenty of
good arcades. I need a new top. Let�s shop till we drop.�

&nbsp;

Judy offered to drive them into town but declined to come
with them. �Two�s company.� she said ruefully. �You pair go and shop. I�ve got
plenty to do on my own.�

&nbsp;

Lisa had forgotten how much fun it was shopping with Babes.
Shoes, skirts, dresses, tops, everything was considered and usually discarded.
Eventually Abebi found a top she liked, but on the way to the changing room
grabbed a dress off the racks. 

&nbsp;

�Come on, Lees, try this on. It will look great on you.�

&nbsp;

The two of them crammed into the cubicle. As Abebi peeled
off her tee shirt Lisa was reminded just how beautiful her breasts were. Not
large, but high and firm. Too soon Abebi pulled the new top over her head.

&nbsp;

�What do you think? Not bad, eh?�

&nbsp;

�You look great, but practically anything looks good on
you.�

&nbsp;

�Umm, flattery will get you everywhere.� Abebi purred.
�Come on, try that dress on.�

&nbsp;

Lisa undid the top of her jeans and started to push them
down. As she bent forward she was giving Abebi a full view of her bottom. 

&nbsp;

�Sheesh, girl! What happened here?�

&nbsp;

Too late Lisa realised the skimpy cotton briefs she had on
would do little to cover the marks Sally had left on her. Flustered she stood
back up. 

&nbsp;

�Look, it�s a long story, not here, I�ll tell you when we
get back. Ok?�

&nbsp;

�Looks nasty. How on earth did that happen?�

&nbsp;

�Please, when we get home. I promise I�ll tell you then.�

&nbsp;

�You better had, girl, I want the full story.�

&nbsp;

��I promise, when we
get home, Ok?�

&nbsp;

This threw a bit of a cloud over the rest of the shopping.
Lisa was too nervous about what she was going to tell Abebi to relax and enjoy
it. Abebi was concerned about what, or who, had been hurting her friend. The
secret stood between them like a wall, the intimacy had gone. They only went to
a couple more shops before they had had enough so they caught the bus back to
Judy�s.

&nbsp;

When they arrived they went up to Lisa�s room. Dumping her
bags on the floor Abebi threw herself on the bed.

&nbsp;

�Come on, girl, we�re home now, what�s the story? I can
tell when you�re hiding something.�

&nbsp;

Lisa just stood there. She was tired of lying, she had to
tell someone and if she trusted anyone apart from Judy it would have to be
Abebi.

&nbsp;

�It�s Judy.� She said at last.

&nbsp;

�Judy did that to you?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, well no, look, it�s difficult�� Oh well, Lisa
thought to herself, it�s now or never. �Judy and I are lovers.�

&nbsp;

�She�s your lover and she does that to you? I don�t
understand.�

&nbsp;

�Please, just listen and I�ll try and explain.� Lisa lay
down on the bed beside Abebi. Slowly at first, but with building confidence as
she got into the story, Lisa told her nearly everything. She explained that
playtime was playtime but otherwise Judy was kind and gentle. How much they cared
for each other and how Judy may cane her but it was completely consensual.
Despite her openness she still wasn�t ready to explain that it had been Sally,
not Judy who had left the marks.

&nbsp;

�So, are you shocked? She said at last.

&nbsp;

�Shocked! I�m amazed! Three long years I tried to get into
those cute little panties of yours but Miss Prim and Proper wasn�t having any.
You move down here and within six months you�re involved in a full-blown affair
with another woman with plenty of S and M on the side. What�s up, girl? Wasn�t
I good enough for you?�

&nbsp;

��Oh, Babes. I never
realised you felt that way. I thought we were just friends. You should have
told me you wanted me like that.� She lay down on the bed next to Abebi and
kissed her gently. �Please say we�re still friends.�

&nbsp;

��Of course, silly.
If you�re happy with her then that�s good enough for me. But your poor bottom,
let me have a look at it.�

&nbsp;

Lisa lay on her back, undid the top of her jeans and
started to push them down. As she did so her thumbs caught her panties. Oh
well, in for a penny, in for a pound, and this was not the time to be shy. She
slid jeans, panties and socks off together and kicked them over the edge of the
bed. The medallion, freed from her panties, lay on her belly.

&nbsp;

�What�s this?� Abebi took the medallion and studied it
closely.

&nbsp;

�A present. A present from Judy.�

&nbsp;

�So I see.� Abebi dropped the medallion and it rolled to
the end of its chain, resting at the top of Lisa labia.

&nbsp;

�So Judy�s heart lies next to your cunt. Very symbolic. Now
roll over and let me see your bottom.�

&nbsp;

As Lisa rolled over she thought about what Abebi had just
said. She didn�t like the �C� word, well, except when she was really turned on,
but yes, Judy�s heart resting there was somehow special, more so than if it had
just been a necklace or something. Meanwhile Abebi was tracing out the lines on
Lisa�s bottom with the tips of her fingers.

&nbsp;

�Doesn�t that hurt? It looks like it should hurt like
blazes.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, it hurt, it still hurts a bit now, but it�s not like
that. It�s all part of something bigger and after she�s caned me we have some
of the most fantastic sex ever. Shall I tell you a secret?�

&nbsp;

�Why stop now? You�ve told me everything else!�

&nbsp;

�What I really like� I know this is going to sound weird�
but what I really like is to have a dildo pushed up my bottom!� There, she�d
said it.

&nbsp;

��Wow, and when I
think of the uptight little virgin I knew at college, and now you�re into all
this.� Abebi was silent for a while. Her fingers still traced lightly over
Lisa�s buttocks. She�d heard about things like this and had always assumed it
was weirdoes in abusive relationships; but this was Lisa and, outside of the
canings, it looked like she and Judy were very happy together. She lay back
down beside Lisa, her hand still caressing Lisa�s bottom.

&nbsp;

��Come on. I want to
know more. How does all this work?�

&nbsp;

�It depends. It�s different every time.�

&nbsp;

�Ok, so how did this one happen? I want details.�

&nbsp;

Lisa thought quickly. She wasn�t ready talk about Friday
nights. She was beginning to realise why Judy had kept quiet for so long. She�d
have to extemporise a bit, not exactly lie, just use another example.

&nbsp;

��We like dressing up
games.� She started. �Judy gets dressed up as a grand lady and I�m her maid.
I�ve got the complete uniform.�

&nbsp;

�Let me see, let me see.� They got up off the bed and Lisa
fetched her maid�s outfit from the wardrobe.

&nbsp;

�That�s fantastic. You�re dead serious about all this,
aren�t you?�

&nbsp;

�Oh, yes. It takes ages to put on. Look, it�s really
authentic.� The two girls pored over the dress, Abebi examining it with care.

&nbsp;

�And Judy, what does she wear?�

&nbsp;

�Oh she�s got this gorgeous burgundy red gown. Just as
authentic as this. You know the sort of thing, full skirt, really tight bodice
for an hourglass figure, leg of mutton sleeves and lots and lots of lace. She
looks gorgeous in it.� But first of all I
bathe her.�

&nbsp;

��Bathe her? How does
that work?�

&nbsp;

�Well I have to run her bath and then, when she gets in, I
wash her all over. Then I have to dry her, dress her and help her get
ready. Look, I know this is difficult to understand but it really gets to me, I
adore looking after her like that. It�s an act of� of love.�

&nbsp;

�Wow. And then?�

&nbsp;

�Well, if I�ve been naughty, I mean, if we�re playing that
I�ve been naughty, she takes me downstairs to the playroom. That�s where we
keep all the bits and pieces. It�s nice and private down there.�

&nbsp;

�Can I have a look?�

&nbsp;

�No, it�s locked and Judy keeps the key. Anyway, she straps
me down over the horse, pulls up my dress and canes me. I know this sounds
weird, I don�t expect you to understand, but until you�ve tried it� I never
knew I could get so turned on by being caned. It�s not the pain, well, not just
the pain, it�s the way she does it. It�s part of us. I�m not explaining this
very well, am I?�

&nbsp;

Abebi was silent beside Lisa. Her hand was still playing
with Lisa�s bottom but the gentle strokes were now firmer, harder, more like a
massage.

&nbsp;

�Maybe you�re explaining it better than you think.� She
said at last. �Come on, what happens next?�

&nbsp;

�Then I have to thank her for the caning. You know, kissing
her, down there. After that it�s all bed and cuddles.�

&nbsp;

�I thought it would end like that.� Abebi leaned forward
and kissed Lisa. �And how about kissing me �down there� as you so delicately
put it. You�ve got me all worked up. The least you can do is sort it out for
me.�

&nbsp;

�I�d love to but� Please, Babes, I�m turned on too but it
would be cheating on Judy.�

&nbsp;

�She�d never know.�

&nbsp;

�I would, that�s the point. I couldn�t go behind her back.�

&nbsp;

�Well, you could do it in front of me. I think she
deserves it.� The two girls spun round to see Judy stood by the open door.

&nbsp;

��How� how long have
you been there.� Lisa gasped.

&nbsp;

�Long enough. I came home, thought the house was empty, and
when I came upstairs your door was open. I couldn�t resist listening for a
while.� Inside Judy�s heart was leaping. She�d admit to herself that her
motives when she�d snuck up on the girls were far from pure. She�d seen them
through the open door and couldn�t resist the opportunity to eavesdrop for a
while. To think she�d been jealous of Abebi. She should have known, she should
have trusted Lisa, and now, purely by chance, she�d been reassured in the best
way possible. And with a little luck it was threesomes tonight!

&nbsp;

Abebi felt like a schoolgirl found smoking behind the bike
sheds. She�d been caught with her pants down, well, with Lisa�s pants down to
be exact, and she didn�t know how to react. And here was Judy suggesting that
she and Lisa should carry on with her consent. It was all a bit too much to
take in at once.

&nbsp;

Lisa was also a little taken aback. Her state of undress
wasn�t a problem, she was getting used to being half, or indeed, completely,
naked in front of Judy but she had been caught in a clinch. Although she hadn�t
let it go any further she felt she�d let Judy down. When she looked up at Judy
she saw she was smiling, moreover there was a glint in her eye she had come to
recognise. It looked like there were three, not two, sexually aroused women in
the room.

&nbsp;

��Yes, I think the
two of you should carry on. But first of all I think Lisa should give you a
bath to get you in the mood. Come along now.� Judy was used to commanding a
boardroom, her tone had carried several major business deals and the two girls
weren�t about to defy it. They glanced at each other, shrugged and followed
Judy to the bathroom.

&nbsp;

Whilst Lisa ran the water, and found a suitable bath oil,
Judy sat down on the toilet.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�Come along, Abebi, get those clothes off, in you go.� Any
doubts that Abebi might have had were again swept away by Judy�s command. It
was simply easier to go along with things than to resist. She stripped off,
dropping her clothes on the floor and slipped into the bath. Lisa judged that
the bath was full enough and turned off the taps.

&nbsp;

��Just lie there. Let
Lisa do the work.� Judy was enjoying the view. Abebi�s dark black skin, her
tight curly bush, her pert breasts laid out before her. She really was an
attractive young woman. Her slight air of unease somehow added to the allure.
Judy felt back in control again.

&nbsp;

Lisa took the sponge, gently lifted Abebi�s leg clear of
the water, and set to work. The sponge soft against her skin, the perfume from
the bath oil, the warm water surrounding her, holding her, were a heady mix
that lulled Abebi into a relaxed, almost dreamlike state. She could almost
forget that Judy was watching. Lisa had reached her thighs and the water
cascading down from the sponge felt wonderful against her skin. Lisa�s story
had turned her on, she wasn�t going to deny that, but this was deeper, more
sensual. Lisa finished her legs and moved on to her arms. Again this was
somehow far more erotic than if Lisa had simply plunged straight in. Abebi
longed to feel the sponge on her breasts, on her belly, on her groin but there
was no hurry. 

&nbsp;

Now Lisa was starting on her breasts. Abebi arched her
back, lifting them, offering them.

&nbsp;

�Now, now.� Judy admonished. �Let Lisa do the work.�

&nbsp;

Abebi relaxed back into the water. The enforced passiveness
was slightly frustrating but it added to the tension inside her. Part of her
wanted to grab Lisa�s head and pull it down to her groin, to hell with the risk
of drowning, but she was beginning to realise that greater pleasure lay in
waiting. No wonder Lisa had described Judy as a wonderful lover, she may not be
an active participant but she certainly knew how to turn a woman on!

&nbsp;

Lisa worked lower, tenderly caressing the gentle mound of
Abebi�s stomach, her lower belly, and finally her groin. Abebi couldn�t
suppress a groan of contentment as the sponge, and the warm water off it, moved
between her legs. This was so delicious, so entrancing, she could lie there
forever.

&nbsp;

��Ok, that�s enough.�
Judy leaned down and pulled the plug and Lisa stood up to allow Abebi out of
the bath.

&nbsp;

�Lisa told me about this but I never realised how good it
could be.�

&nbsp;

�Uh huh, no talking now, you just relax and enjoy it.�
Judy�s tone had softened, gone from boardroom to schoolroom, but it still
commanded.

&nbsp;

Lisa picked a soft, fluffy towel and dried Abebi down. When
Abebi went to help a gentle wave of the forefinger from Judy reminded her that
Lisa should do all the work. As Lisa reached her feet she bent forward and
gently kissed her toes. Abebi felt this strange mixture of control and
controlled. Here she was with Lisa crouched before her tending to her every
need. On the other hand it could not be denied that the dominant force in the
room was Judy, it was her tune that everyone danced to.

&nbsp;

Lisa stood up and, directed by a glance from Judy, fetched
Abebi a creamy white satin thigh length dressing gown which hung behind the
door. Her dark skin was set off perfectly against the pale material. Lisa
wondered what she would look like in a white collar, not that she would want
Abebi to wear the one Judy had given her, that was hers!

&nbsp;

��Come, my dear,
let�s have a drink. Lisa will clear up.� They left and went downstairs. As fast
as she could Lisa wiped round the bath, tidied the bath oils, picked up Abebi�s
clothes and put the towel in the washing basket. Catching sight of herself in the
mirror she realised she was still wearing her tee shirt and bra. She stripped
them off and hurried downstairs.

&nbsp;

Judy and Abebi sat
in the lounge drinking wine. Judy had selected a full-bodied Shiraz and Abebi
could feel the glow from the wine mixing with all the other delicious feelings
inside her.

&nbsp;

�Ah, Lisa, there you are. It looks like Abebi�s glass is
empty. Top it up. And when you�ve done that show her how a woman is
worshipped.� Lisa topped up the glass, put down the bottle and knelt before
Abebi. Softly she kissed the tops of her feet, her lips gently brushing the
skin. She knew where she was heading but she also knew better than to hurry.
Worship was about taking your time, allowing your mistress to savour every
second, allowing yourself to savour every second.

&nbsp;

Abebi�s head was beginning to spin. She hadn�t really
wanted the second glass but it would have been rude to refuse. It wasn�t as if
she was getting drunk exactly, she could handle far more than two glasses of
wine, but it was getting to her far faster than it would normally, adding to
the overall mellow glow.

&nbsp;

Lisa had reached Abebi�s knees. She eased them apart to
allow her to continue. She kissed in little lines, from the knee to about half
way up, sensitive skin against sensitive skin. Abebi put down her glass and sat
back. Despite her highly aroused state she was fully appreciating the lack of
hurry. Oh, she could get used to this! With each line of kisses Lisa moved a
little further, a little closer, pushing Abebi ever higher. Just a few more,
maybe the next one, or the next, this one, Ohhhh!

&nbsp;

Lisa�s tongue, finally at its destination, found Abebi more
than ready. Her clitoris was swollen and extended, offering itself up. Lisa
flicked gently, her tongue moving from side to side. Abebi slumped further into
her chair, hoping that easier access would urge Lisa on. Lisa�s flicks of the
tongue were getting stronger, harder but keeping the same steady rhythm, a
rhythm that ran through Abebi�s body, incessant, unstoppable. The tension
inside Abebi rose and rose, she felt as if she would explode, wave upon wave
upon wave crashed through her, higher, higher�

&nbsp;

�Oh, Yes! Oh, Yes! Oh, Yessssss!� She lost all concept of
space and time as she felt herself lifted up, exultant, lost in the intensity
of it all.

&nbsp;

When Abebi came back to earth she found that Lisa was still
kneeling before her, looking up with an ear-to-ear grin. She lent forward,
pulled her up, and kissed her, lip to lip. She could taste herself on Lisa�s
mouth. Heaven knows what state the dressing gown would be in! They broke from
the kiss and Abebi looked over at Judy who smiled like the cat that swallowed
the cream.

&nbsp;

��Now that we�ve got
that sorted I think it�s time to eat. Abebi, I think you need to change your
dressing gown.�

&nbsp;

��Don�t worry, I�ve
got just the thing.� Abebi went upstairs to change while Judy and Lisa went to
the kitchen to sort out what to eat. Steaks, a light salad and new potatoes
seemed to fit the bill. Judy also opened another bottle of wine, as the other
one was half empty. She�d have to keep an eye on it though. Drunken orgies were
all very well but she didn�t want any alcohol induced excesses tonight.
Furthermore she�d had the �you got me drunk and seduced me scene� before from
newcomers with second thoughts in the morning. She didn�t want to give Abebi
that excuse. Nicely relaxed but still in control, that was what she was after.

&nbsp;

Abebi returned downstairs wearing a dressing gown that was
barely decent. A request from Judy for a saucepan from the bottom shelf was all
it needed to confirm that it was all she was wearing. Surreptitiously Judy
slipped the heating on. Even on a warm day like this she didn�t want the girls
complaining of being chilly. Lisa put on an apron to protect herself from
spitting fat as she fried the steaks. Judy and Abebi put the salad together.

&nbsp;

They chatted as they ate. Abebi was taken by how normal it
felt to be sitting there with Lisa naked except for her chain and herself
wearing precious little more. Meanwhile, Judy was trying to work out how to get
Abebi into the next stage of things. Lisa was a natural submissive and just
needed to be shown the way but Abebi was far more self-assured and Judy didn�t
want to spoil things by being too hasty. In the end it was Abebi who brought it
up.

&nbsp;

��Lisa tells me
you�re into role play. She�s shown me her maid�s outfit. Your gown sounds
gorgeous.�

&nbsp;

�And which would you like to try?� Here we go,
thought Judy.

&nbsp;

��I think the gown
would suit me best. I�m not sure about burgundy with my complexion but I know
I�m not the little maid type.�

&nbsp;

�Certainly. We�ll have a go after supper.� Judy wasn�t
surprised. Looks like I might be going sub this evening she thought to
herself. It might not be her natural inclination but it wouldn�t be the first
time. She was a big believer in �if you can�t take it, don�t give it�. 

&nbsp;

When they had finished their meal they cleared up and Judy
led them upstairs to the bedroom. She fetched her gown and accessories from the
wardrobe; Abebi shrugged off her dressing gown and the three of them set to.
Abebi was slightly slimmer than Judy but roughly the same height. Here laces
showed their benefits by having so much more leeway than buttons or zips. The
fit wasn�t perfect but at least Abebi didn�t look like a little girl in her
mum�s clothes. Corset, stockings and bloomers came first. Lisa was just
reaching for a chemise when Judy stopped her.

&nbsp;

��Abebi, you look
fabulous. Take a look in the mirror.�

&nbsp;

Abebi turned to the mirror. Judy was right. The crisp,
white, perfectly ironed cotton contrasted perfectly with her dark skin. The
corset accentuated her curves. It was just high enough to support her breasts
leaving her nipples proud and free. It seemed almost a shame to cover it all
up. Never mind, what goes on can come off!

&nbsp;

�Do you mind if I take a photograph?� Judy held up her
camera.

&nbsp;

�Certainly, but�� Abebi studied herself in the mirror. She
could feel the clothes putting her in role. She felt there was something
missing from the picture. She needed something to hold. She thought back to
what little she knew about Edwardian times. Horses always seemed to figure in
everything she�d read. �Do you have a riding crop or something?�

&nbsp;

��As a matter of fact
I do.� Judy rummaged in the wardrobe, found the holdall, and fetched out a
riding crop.

&nbsp;

Abebi found it was exactly what she wanted. She loved what
she saw in the mirror. She posed, tall, haughty, arrogant, every inch the
dominant woman flexing the crop between her hands. When Judy had finished she
didn�t want to give it back. She liked the sound as it swished through the air.
She thwacked it against the bed a couple of times just to hear the sound. Then
she flicked it at Lisa�s bottom.

&nbsp;

��Ow! That hurt!�

&nbsp;

�Easy now, poor Lisa�s bottom has had all it can take for a
day or two.� Judy intervened.

&nbsp;

�Understood, but I still demand respect. I think the two of
you should call me �Mistress� from now on.�

&nbsp;

��Yes, Mistress.�
Lisa replied without hesitation.

&nbsp;

�Yes, Mistress.� Judy was less certain. Now she knew
she was going sub and controlling the evening would be that bit harder. Still,
she liked a challenge and the prospects for an interesting evening had just got
a lot better.

&nbsp;

�Now get on with it.� Lisa and Judy helped Abebi into the
chemise, petticoats and gown. Completed she stood tall and regal, very much in
control. Judy, feeling that she needed to do something to reassert her
authority, fetched Lisa�s collar and put it on her.

&nbsp;

�And what about you?� Abebi turned to Judy. �I�m all
dressed up, Lisa is suitably attired, and you�re still in normal clothes. I
don�t think that�s right, do you?�

&nbsp;

�No, Mistress. How would you like me dressed?�

&nbsp;

Abebi thought about it. For once she wasn�t sure. She
didn�t know what was available and, as the incident with Lisa had shown, she
didn�t know the boundaries. Suddenly she�d found that control brought
responsibilities and she�d have to tread a little carefully if she wasn�t going
to blow it.

&nbsp;

�We�ll start with naked, I think.� That was safe enough.
She watched in admiration as Judy disrobed. Not bad at all. Judy might be older
than her but she wasn�t letting her body show it. And her clothes! Pure silk
underwear if she was any judge. She wondered if Judy had put them on specially
or always dressed like that. �Ok, let�s try this playroom of yours.� 

&nbsp;

Judy led them downstairs and opened the door to the
playroom. As Abebi entered she was amazed by what she saw. She wandered round
like a child in a sweet shop, eager to try everything and not sure where to
start. Some of the equipment, the log for example, was dismantled and tidied
against the wall and Abebi could only guess how it was used. There were no such
doubts about the selection of paddles, canes, tawses and floggers, which hung
on the wall. Below them was a bench holding assorted leatherwear, some, like
wrist cuffs, obvious, some less so. Next to the leatherwear was a collection of
strap-ons, mostly designed to pleasure the giver as much as the receiver. She
wondered why some of them seemed so thin and puny until she saw a tube of
lubricant and remembered Lisa�s confession. The thinner ones must be for anal
use. The thought intrigued her but she�d leave that for later.

&nbsp;

Then she came to the pillars. Their purpose was obvious and
it was time to start something. Which one to tie up? She looked over at Judy
and Lisa waiting patiently and decided.

&nbsp;

�Judy, I want Lisa spread-eagled between these pillars. Get
on with it.� Judy fetched some shackles from the bench and fastened Lisa, hands
about head height, legs as far enough apart as they would go without being so
uncomfortable that Lisa would get cramps. Meanwhile Abebi returned to the bench
and picked up a few bits and pieces. The first was a stiff leather collar with
a wide strap running down the back to two wrist cuffs. As she secured Judy she
noticed how it forced her to thrust her breasts forward. The nipples stood
proud and hard and Abebi couldn�t resist bending forward and teasing them with
her teeth. Her hand slid down Judy�s body and rested, flat palmed, over Judy�s
crotch. For a while she toyed with her, teased her, her hand massaging firmly
but never entering. Then she fastened Judy�s ankles together, shuffled her
forward and knelt her down in front of Lisa.

&nbsp;

��I know she�s licked
your cunt out often enough. Now it�s time for you to return the favour. Get on
with it, or do you need a little encouragement?� 

&nbsp;

Judy could guess what Abebi meant by �encouragement� so she
leant forward and started probing with her tongue. Abebi meanwhile moved round
behind Lisa and, stretching around her, attached nipple clamps leaving the interlinking
chain running behind Lisa�s back. 

&nbsp;

��Is that what you
like?� she whispered in Lisa�s ear. �Shall I squeeze them a little?�

&nbsp;

Judy was no novice with her tongue and Abebi�s fingers
fondling Lisa�s breasts, toying with the nipple clamps, were causing frissons
of excitement to run through her body. She rolled her head and sighed deeply. A
few more minutes and Abebi could feel Lisa building to a climax.

&nbsp;

��Stop! That�s
enough.� Lisa sighed with disappointment. Abebi went over to the bench and
picked up one of the thinner strap-ons. �I want to see exactly how you use
these things. Show me.�

&nbsp;

Getting Judy sorted involved unfastening her wrists and
ankles. Abebi had no experience of what went where as Judy sorted out the
strap-on and plenty of lubricant. With Lisa still spread-eagled it was a bit
awkward but Judy managed it. She wrapped one arm around just below Lisa�s
breasts and reached for her groin with the other as she slid inside. This was
far from the first time they had coupled like this but doing it in front of
Abebi as if they were some sort of circus act made it humiliating. Judy held
tight, flesh squeezed on flesh as she slid in and out with slow firm strokes.

�

�Judy�s lips were
millimetres from Lisa�s ear. Quietly she whispered �When we�ve finished I think
we should turn the tables on your little friend, agreed?�

&nbsp;

Lisa�s slight nod was missed by Abebi who was watching,
fascinated as the strap-on slid back and forth.

&nbsp;

Despite the humiliation Lisa loved being taken by Judy this
way. She�d long ago stopped wondering why the feel of the strap-on inside her
was such a turn on but it was. That and the feel of her true mistress holding
firm against her, flesh against flesh, were pushing her towards her peak.
Judy�s fingers were busy against her clitoris, busy with her nipple. She no
longer cared that Abebi was watching, she just wanted to lose herself, feel
herself taken, plundered.

&nbsp;

Judy�s mood was far less mellow. After all, she hadn�t been
warmed up like Lisa was. Although the strap-on was well designed its
ministrations felt more annoying than erotic. Still, she could feel Lisa
starting to come. She�d do the show, let Lisa come and then� Anger rather than
passion drove the next thrust and a squeak from Lisa reminded her to keep
herself in check and resume a steadier rhythm.

&nbsp;

�Yes, my sweet, like that, my sweet?� she whispered in
Lisa�s ear. Judy felt Lisa�s body tense, stiffen, strain against the bonds.
Firmly she thrust once, twice and a final deep, deep plunge as Lisa climaxed.

&nbsp;

��Very pretty, well done.�
Abebi was obviously enjoying herself.

&nbsp;

As Judy withdrew and un-strapped herself Abebi came over
and released Lisa. She was so busy with the buckles that she didn�t notice Judy
moving behind her. Suddenly Judy wrapped her arms around Abebi and held her
tight. Abebi struggled but Judy�s time in the gym meant she was fit and strong
and well able to hold the younger woman.

&nbsp;

�You�ve had your fun, now it�s our turn.� Judy hissed
between clamped teeth. �Lisa, some wrist cuffs please.�

&nbsp;

Abebi was hampered by the heavy gown and she was no match
for Judy. Even so it took a few tries before her wrists were locked together.
Judy put her down on the floor and Lisa sat on her legs to stop her kicking
while she fastened her ankles together.�
While Lisa remained on Abebi, Judy fetched a length of chain, attached
it to the wrist cuffs and threaded the other end through a loop in the ceiling.
She motioned Lisa to get off and pulled on the chain until Abebi was standing
up with her arms above her head. Abebi was too taken aback, and too restrained,
to make more than the feeblest protests. She was also slightly tipsy from the
wine she had drunk earlier which reduced her inhibitions. 

&nbsp;

��Well, did you enjoy
your time in charge?� Judy asked.

&nbsp;

�Yes, yes I did.�

&nbsp;

�Yes what?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Mistress.�

&nbsp;

�That�s better. But now you�re going to experience the
other side and I think you�re a little over dressed. Burgundy never was your
colour. Lisa, give me a hand here.�

&nbsp;

Getting the gown and chemise off Abebi was a little complex
in her present state but, after a certain amount of unfastening and
refastening, they managed it. The petticoats were far less of a problem and
they soon lay on the floor in a puddle at Abebi�s feet. She was left in corset,
bloomers and stockings. Lisa tidied the clothes away as Judy arranged a
full-length mirror in front of Abebi.

&nbsp;

��That�s better. So
much prettier. Do you still think you need a riding crop to finish off the
outfit?�

&nbsp;

�No, Mistress.�

&nbsp;

�Lisa, I think we need a spreader bar.� Lisa fetched one
over and Abebi�s ankles were refastened. Judy untied the waistband of the
bloomers allowing them to fall around Abebi�s knees. Abebi was beginning to
understand why Judy had positioned the mirror in front of her. She had never
felt so open and vulnerable. Judy went to the bench and returned but Abebi
couldn�t see what she had fetched. Judy stood behind her and reached round to
her crotch, her fingers playing with and spreading her labia as if to emphasis
her openness. Then her other arm came round. This time Judy was holding a large
dildo and rested it against the entrance to Abebi�s vagina.

&nbsp;

�Is this what you want?�

&nbsp;

�No. Yes. I don�t know.�

&nbsp;

�Maybe this will help you decide.� In one smooth movement
Judy eased the dildo inside her, filling her. Abebi couldn�t help her body�s
reaction, thrusting her hips forward to meet it. The view in the mirror
mesmerised her. Here she was behaving like some sort of amoral slut but she
couldn�t resist Judy�s fingers and, as for the dildo, she swayed her hips,
eager to feel it slide back and forth, deeper and deeper. She didn�t care how
she looked, she was responding to an inner need. Lisa watched in amusement as
her friend pushed her hips forward, forcing the dildo inside herself. On a whim
she grabbed the camera, just time for a quick photograph. 

&nbsp;

��That�s enough for
now.� Abebi�s rising passion was cut short as Judy removed the dildo and took
it back to the bench. Abebi gasped in disappointment. 

&nbsp;

�What�s that? Didn�t you want me to stop?�

&nbsp;

�Please, Mistress.� Abebi wasn�t quite sure what she was
asking for, but in the frustration of being left high and dry she�d accept
anything, anything to scratch this itch.

&nbsp;

��Do you want to
come? Is that it?�

&nbsp;

�Yes please, Mistress.�

&nbsp;

�But first you�re going to have to earn it. Only my slaves get
to come. Are you willing to be my slave?�

&nbsp;

�Yes. Yes please, Mistress.� Abebi realised what she had
just said. In the heat of the moment, without thinking, she�d promised� but
right now she�d do anything, anything.

&nbsp;

Judy loosened the chain and released Abebi�s wrists, only
to refasten them behind her back. She pushed Abebi to her knees and went round
and stood so that her buttocks were right in front of Abebi.

&nbsp;

�Slaves worship their Mistress, don�t they?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Mistress.�

&nbsp;

�So what are you waiting for?� Abebi reached forward and
kissed each buttock.

&nbsp;

�Not like that stupid. Do it properly and use your tongue.�

&nbsp;

Abebi realised what she meant and pushed her face into the
crack between the buttocks. Her tongue probed and found Judy�s sphincter. Abebi
could think of few acts that could be more humiliating but she was swept up in
the moment. She was too involved to back out now, and, somewhat to her
surprise, the eroticism of what she was doing overcame her distaste. Her body
ached with the need to come if this was part of the game then she wasn�t
totally averse.

&nbsp;

Abruptly Judy turned away and went over to the throne.
Again Abebi found her increasing fever cut short, again she was left high and
dry.

&nbsp;

��Lisa, my pet, come
here. I need your tongue.� Lisa hurried over, knelt down in front of Judy and
set to work. With a satisfied smile Judy turned to Abebi who could only watch,
bound and helpless on the floor.

&nbsp;

�Is there anything you could do for me that Lisa here
couldn�t do?�

&nbsp;

�No, Mistress.� Abebi watched Lisa�s head buried between
Judy�s thighs; she wanted to be there, to be part of it.

&nbsp;

�So why should I let you come? Do you think you deserve
it?�

&nbsp;

��I� I don�t know,
Mistress.�

&nbsp;

�Maybe� Ooooh� Maybe if I spanked your bottom?� Much as
Judy enjoyed taunting Abebi it was getting difficult to concentrate.

&nbsp;

�Yes, yes please, Mistress.�

&nbsp;

�You�ll just have to wait until I let you.� Satisfied that
she had reasserted her authority, that she was back on top, Judy relaxed back
to enjoy Lisa�s tongue. Watching Abebi watching her, kneeling on the floor
before her, bound, exposed, and so aroused her tongue was practically hanging
out in anticipation, was the icing on the cake. This was right; this was how it
should be, and basking in self-satisfaction she let herself dissolve into waves
of pleasure.

&nbsp;

Abebi was feeling nervous. She was in far deeper than she
had anticipated and was powerless to control events. Sure, they had told her
the safe word, but that wasn�t really an option. The guilty thrill, the raw
animal excitement was getting to her in ways she had never known before. She
wanted to run away, she wanted to stay, above all she wanted the itch inside
her satisfied. As she watched Judy began to writhe in the throne, her hands
stroking her sides. Lisa looped her arms over Judy�s thighs to hold her steady,
to concentrate on what she was doing. Judy arched her back, almost pushing
herself out of the throne and with a cry of �Yes, yes, YES!� she climaxed.

&nbsp;

As soon as she had caught her breath Judy reached down and
pulled Lisa gently up onto her lap. They kissed long and hard, relaxing in
Judy�s post-orgasm glow. Playfully Judy broke the kiss and gently licked Lisa�s
chin, enjoying the rich taste of her own juice. One final peck on the lips and�

&nbsp;

��Mmmm. That was
nice. Now what shall we do with your little friend? How about a sandwich? Shall
I let her poke that lovely bottom of yours?�

&nbsp;

��You know I always
like that, but what�s a sandwich?� Lisa asked.

&nbsp;

��I�ll show you, but
first I owe her a smacking.� Judy eased Lisa off her lap and stood up to go to
the wall and fetch a paddle. She then stood Lisa in front of Abebi.

&nbsp;

��Bend forward, kiss
her toes, that�s right, bottom in the air.� Abebi lent forward as demanded.
�Twelve strokes should suffice.�

&nbsp;

As Abebi kissed Lisa�s toes Judy laid twelve firm slaps of
the paddle across her bottom. She was careful to get it right; Abebi was, after
all, a beginner. A healthy glow was what she was after. The slaps of the paddle
were echoed by muffled squeaks from Abebi.

&nbsp;

The spanking completed Lisa and Judy helped Abebi to her
feet.

&nbsp;

�Now then, seeing as you so enjoyed watching me servicing
Lisa�s bottom I�ve got a little treat for you. Lisa, fetch the horse.�

&nbsp;

As Lisa brought the horse over Judy went to the bench and
fetched a strap-on and the lubricant. She attached the strap-on to Abebi and
ordered Lisa to bend over the horse. Lisa knew what was coming and spread her
legs ready. Judy guided Abebi up behind Lisa and, after a quick application of
lubricant, guided the strap-on smoothly inside. Then she bent Abebi forward so
she was leaning over Lisa�s back.

&nbsp;

Abebi had never seen a strap-on before, and certainly never
worn one. This particular model was double ended and the part that fitted
inside her was pressing all the right buttons. Tentatively she eased it back
and forth feeling the way it pushed against her clitoris, feeling Lisa respond
beneath her.

&nbsp;

��Uh-huh. You stay
still, I�m not ready yet.� Judy warned her. She then returned to the bench and
fetched a second strap-on. 

&nbsp;

Judy spreading the lubricant around her sphincter was
making Abebi anxious. She could tell that Lisa enjoyed it; she could feel the
muscles of her bottom moving beneath her as Lisa savoured the feeling, but she
had never, ever, done anything like this before. The feel of Judy�s strap-on
against her caused a sudden wave of panic.

&nbsp;

�I�m not sure I can do this.� She protested.

&nbsp;

�Oh yes you can. Just relax, that will make it easier.�

&nbsp;

The strap-on was pushing harder and harder against her
sphincter. Desperately Abebi tried to relax and then, suddenly, a quick twinge
of pain, and it was in her. The feeling was strange, not exactly unpleasant,
more of a full feeling which combined with the glow from her bottom and the
pressure of her strap-on inside her vagina to form a heady mix. She felt Judy�s
body meet hers pushing deep inside her.

&nbsp;

Judy hardly moved in and out at all, rather it was a
succession of pushes against her bottom. The pain of it being stretched was
matched by the pleasure of the pressure as her strap-on moved against her
clitoris. Her breasts were also sliding against Lisa�s back giving a tingle all
of their own to add to the mix. Lisa picked up the rhythm and met each push
with a counter push as far as she was able.�
The intensity of the feeling was filling Abebi�s body, she could hear
both Lisa and Judy grunt with every push and soon she was joining in. It was as
if the three of them were melding together becoming one single entity.

&nbsp;

��Harder, please,
harder.� Lisa urged from the bottom of the pile. Judy increased the pressure
and Abebi felt she could hardly take any more, but she had to, she needed to.
She was nearly there, she was nearly there, she was nearly, nearly, nearly
there� Abebi felt like a white water rafter, swept away by an unstoppable
current. She was no longer in control of herself, her senses, anything. Wave
after wave swept through her driven by the incessant pounding from her rear. At
last she could take no more, Physically, emotionally and, above all, sexually
exhausted she collapsed across Lisa�s back letting the last few dregs drain
from her, spent, a little sore, but completely satisfied.

&nbsp;

For a while the three of them just lay there getting their
breath back, letting the feelings subside. Then Judy withdrew and Abebi
followed. Slowly the three women un-entangled themselves and removed the
strap-ons and Abebi�s bonds. Judy gathered them together and they hugged,
coming down gently, returning to normal.

&nbsp;

��Well, I don�t know
about you but I could do with a shower. Come along.� Judy led them upstairs. Three
in the shower was more than a bit crowded but wonderfully relaxing. The soap,
the warm water, the feel of flesh against flesh, never knowing quite whose hand
was washing whom, brought them together in a way that words never could. The
barriers between them washed away, swirling down the plughole with the
soapsuds, mistress and slave became one, became lovers. After that it seemed
only natural that there were three in the bed that night.

&nbsp;

Lisa awoke the next morning to the sound of murmured
chattering. There beside her was the comforting bulk of Judy�s back. She
snuggled in close and kissed Judy on the shoulders, feeling the warm skin next
to hers. It was so nice to be here in bed next to her lover, she wished Judy
would lie in every morning so they could wake up together and explore each
other�s bodies in that drowsy half sleep where every touch is slow and gentle.
After a few moments Judy rolled onto her back.

&nbsp;

�Good morning. We were wondering when you would join us.
Abebi�s been telling me all about your time at university.�

&nbsp;

�Morning, Lees.� Abebi sat up and, leaning across Judy,
tried to kiss Lisa. Seeing that she couldn�t reach Lisa leaned forward and met
her half way. Expecting a mild, early morning kiss Lisa was surprised when
Abebi turned it into a full smooch. When they broke the kiss Abebi caught
Lisa�s eye and, glanced downwards. She then snuggled back into Judy�s armpit
and started to kiss Judy�s nipple. Lisa glanced up at Judy and, encouraged by
her smile, snuggled down to kiss the other one. Wonderfully relaxed, and with
the smooth warmth of Judy�s body against hers, she slid her hand across Judy�s
belly. It was no surprise to find that Abebi�s hand already there. Their
fingers touched, clasped, and they led each other lower, both urged on by the
boldness of the other.

&nbsp;

Judy lay back and wallowed in it all. She�d been reassured
by her chat with Abebi. Although they had undoubtedly gone far beyond what the
young woman was normally comfortable with, she seemed quite happy about what
had happened, and now, the two of them, caressing her body, were making her
feel wonderfully turned on. 

&nbsp;

Ummm. She
wondered which one had just probed inside her labia, opening her up. She eased
her legs apart to make it easier. On her right Abebi was starting to rub her
groin against her, Lisa as ever lay quieter, the more passive partner. Ooooh.
That must be Abebi�s fingers against her clitoris. She felt herself responding
more and more strongly. A voice at the back of her head reminded her to make
sure Lisa didn�t get excluded. The last thing she wanted was for this to end in
a jealous scene and the way things were going she�d be in a clinch with Abebi
in a moment. Gently she eased the two girls from her nipples.

&nbsp;

�Ummm, that was nice but now I think it�s Lisa�s turn in
the middle.� A little reluctantly the two girls separated and they shuffled
around. It was Lisa who now felt the sensation, the thrill, of both nipples
being expertly manipulated. Abebi was sucking, drawing the nipple into her
mouth; Judy tended to use her teeth more. As Abebi got more urgent, more
pressing, Judy gradually drew back and watched. The contrast between the two
girls was striking, not just Abebi�s jet black hair against Lisa�s blonde
tresses, Abebi�s ebony skin against Lisa�s milky white complexion, but Abebi�s
more forceful style against Lisa�s passive acceptance. Abebi was almost
climbing on top of Lisa as she tried to rub her groin harder and harder against
Lisa�s thigh. Propping herself up on her elbow she reached across for Abebi�s
bottom, her fingers reaching into the crack. Following Abebi�s rhythm she
pulled her harder onto Lisa and with each pull her fingers probed deeper,
deeper until they found the puckered ring of her sphincter. With the next pull
the tip of her forefinger slipped inside. As if Judy had flicked a switch
inside her Abebi responded, grinding herself against Lisa with added urgency,
muffled grunts of pleasure coming from her lips as she suckled Lisa with
increasing vigour.

&nbsp;

�Ok, and now it�s Abebi�s turn.� The two girls looked up in
bemused amazement, their rising passion again cut short in mid flow, and both
made feeble protests but neither thought to disobey. Once more they shuffled
round until Abebi lay in the middle. As Lisa lowered her head to kiss Abebi�s
nipple she caught Judy�s looking at her. For a brief moment their eyes locked,
a private, special moment, an acknowledgement that there was a bond between
them, a bond that Abebi was not part of. 

&nbsp;

Abebi was already near her climax. Her chat with Judy had
stirred some strangely powerful memories from last night and since Lisa had
woken the stirrings in her mind had been reinforced by the play between the
three of them. Someone's fingers, she guessed Judy's, were working a special
magic between her thighs until, once more, Oh, don�t stop now! they
pulled away.

&nbsp;

Judy tapped Lisa on the shoulder and motioned her to move
down the bed. Lisa scooted down, pushing the remaining bedclothes to the floor
as she went, and settled between Abebi's thighs. Meanwhile Judy got up and
knelt over Abebi's shoulders, trapping her arms beneath her legs. As Lisa's
tongue probed teasingly between Abebi�s thighs Judy reached down, spread her
lips, and lowered herself onto Abebi�s face.

&nbsp;

Abebi was pinned to the bed, Lisa arms rested across her
thighs, holding her lower half still and Judy's weight on her upper half
prevented any movement there. The feeling of helplessness, unable to stop Lisa
lapping at her clitoris and unable to do other than lap at Judy's clitoris in
return, reinforced the erotic charge. Her muscles tensed as the waves grew
stronger. Sensing this Lisa eased back, teasing, tantalising, keeping Abebi
fully aroused but not letting her climax. She waited until she could hear Judy
starting to come, judging from her moans how close she was. As Judy groans grew
urgent, pressing, Lisa went back to full powered licks.

&nbsp;

�Yes! Yes! Now! Now!� Judy cried out. Abebi writhed around
and Lisa had to hang on tight to keep with her, to push her that last final
bit. �Ohhhhh, yes!� Judy screamed as Abebi arched her back as far as she could
beneath her. With a final �YES!!!� Judy collapsed back onto the bed and Abebi,
her cries muffled beneath Judy, went rigid as the final wave of her orgasm
crashed within her. Panting slightly from exertion the three women cuddled
together letting the waves subside.

&nbsp;

�Well, that�s you and me sorted. What about Lisa?� Judy
asked when she had got her breath back. Abebi needed no further urging and slid
down the bed kissing Lisa�s body all the while. Judy kissed Lisa�s lips,
savouring the lingering taste of Abebi, and let her hands search out those
places where Lisa most loved to be stroked. Abebi�s tongue and Judy�s hand
worked their magic together and within minutes Lisa was feeling the passion
rise within her. She held Judy as close as she could without disturbing Abebi.
She wanted to squeeze her so tightly to herself that they became one, until
their bodies melted together. Abebi, for all her hard work, was almost
forgotten, a mere instrument that played upon her body; it was Judy she craved,
Judy she loved, Judy she needed so badly that it hurt. Lisa�s hands, clutching
Judy�s shoulders, held on so tightly that her nails dug in to Judy�s flesh. She
broke from the kiss and buried her face in Judy�s neck.

&nbsp;

�I love you, I love you, I love you, Ohhh, I love you so
much.� She repeated over and over again, a mantra, a prayer to her goddess. As
her climax arrived her voice broke and she sobbed, overcome with emotion, too
much, far too much for her body to contain. She hung on tight to Judy, her
Judy, her centre.

&nbsp;

Abebi came back up the bed and Lisa and Judy broke from
their clinch to let her in. For many minutes they lay there hugging each other
close, content and satisfied.

&nbsp;

�Wow, sex with you guys is the best!� It was Abebi who
broke the silence, also breaking the mood.

&nbsp;

�I�m glad you think so.� Judy replied. �Come along now,
it�s time for breakfast. Anyone for a shower?�

&nbsp;

For the rest of the morning Lisa and Abebi dressed in loose
clothing and lay in the garden, enjoying the sun, catching up on news. Judy had
work to do in the study and left them to it.

&nbsp;

�Babes?� Lisa rolled over on the towel laid on the lawn.
�Do you think I'm some kind of sicko?�

&nbsp;

Abebi paused for a minute. �No, I don't. What you and Judy
are into isn't my cup of tea, well, not entirely.� She grinned wickedly. �But
I've never seen you so happy. You're really set on Judy aren't you?�

&nbsp;

�She's... She's special. She makes me feel safe. I'm not
happy unless she's around. I only wish I was sure she felt the same about me.�

&nbsp;

�You really are besotted, aren't you? And as for Judy, I've
seen the way she looks at you. You don't need to worry on that score, but the
games you play, sheesh, my bottom's still sore from last night. It was wild
while it lasted but I don't think buggery's my thing.�

&nbsp;

�I don't know, I rather like the feeling, knowing where
she's been. It gives Monday morning at work an extra twist if I can still feel
her.�

&nbsp;

�Whatever turns you on, girl. Whatever turns you on. Now
tell me more about that job of yours...�

&nbsp;

Some time later Judy appeared at the back door. �Abebi, if
your going to catch the two o-clock you need to get your act together. Do you
want a sandwich before you go?� 

&nbsp;

Lisa smiled to herself as the word �sandwich� brought back
memories of last night. She�d have to ask Judy if she could be the filling next
time, she rather fancied that. But right now she was peckish and would quite
happily settle for the bread and butter version.

&nbsp;

The three of them bustled round, Abebi packing with Lisa
helping and Judy putting together a bite to eat. Finished at last Judy ran them
to the station and they trooped down onto the platform to see Abebi off.

&nbsp;

�Thank you, thank you so much for all your hospitality.
I've had an, err, interesting weekend!� 

&nbsp;

�You're more than welcome, my dear. Here, I got you this
for the journey.� Judy handed Abebi a magazine and kissed her on the cheek.

&nbsp;

�Lees, it�s been great to see you. We mustn�t leave it so
long next time.� Abebi and Lisa kissed.

&nbsp;

�Thanks for coming, Babes. Love you.� Lisa replied.

&nbsp;

�Thanks, thanks again. I'll see you both soon I hope. And
if you're ever in Cambridge...� Abebi waved goodbye, boarded the train and
found her seat.

&nbsp;

As the train pulled out from Temple Meads station Abebi
looked at the magazine Judy had given her. Vogue&nbsp;she thought. Not
really my thing, posh women in posh frocks. She was idly flicking through
the pages when two sheets of stiffish paper fell out. She assumed they were
advertising flyers until she looked again and slammed the magazine down on top
of them. Carefully she eased them out from under the magazine making sure no
one else could see. Yes, she had seen them correctly, it was two photos from
last night; one of her posing with the riding crop; the second was far more
graphic, showing her strung from the ceiling while Judy serviced her with a
dildo. She blushed hard remembering all she had done. These photos were
definitely not&nbsp;for the family album but what a memento of an
amazing weekend!

&nbsp;

To be continued�














It was Thursday evening and Judy was on the phone to Charlotte

It was Thursday evening and Judy was on the phone to
Charlotte. �A pony day, that sounds great. ... Yes, I saw the weather forecast.
Hot and sunny, just what we need ... We'll come over about eleven then. Can we
bring anything, a quiche? A salad? ... Ok, see you on Saturday, bye.� She put
the phone down and turned to Lisa. �That was Charlotte. Friday�s cancelled,
we�re having a picnic on her lawn on Saturday instead.�

&nbsp;

�That sounds like fun. Will we have the usual games?�

&nbsp;

�Sort of. It�s always a bit different outside. Charlotte�s
got a thing about pony girls, you�ve seen the photos.�

&nbsp;

Lisa thought about the pictures. There was one of Sally
looking cute wearing a complicated bridle and reins pulling a small cart with
Charlotte, dressed to the nines, riding in it. The thought didn�t particularly
appeal but she�d learnt to keep an open mind. In the last few months she�d
found quite a few things which turned her on that she wouldn�t have dreamed of
before, and with Britain going through a rare Indian summer it seemed an ideal
time to play outdoors. 

&nbsp;

Saturday morning arrived and Judy was busy in the kitchen
packing a cool box with food for the picnic when Lisa came downstairs looking
glum.

&nbsp;

�What�s up, my pet? Why the long face?� Judy asked.

&nbsp;

�Bloody period. I�ve just started, I can�t go like this.
The last thing I�ll feel today is sexy.� She slumped down on a chair.

&nbsp;

Judy came up behind
her and, wrapping her arms round her neck, kissed her on the top of the head. 

&nbsp;

�Come anyway. I know you can�t play but a day out in the
sun will do you good, it might even cheer you up a bit.�

&nbsp;

�But I�ll feel so out of it, I�ll be the ghost at the
party,�

&nbsp;

�Nonsense. We�re all women; we�ve all been there. Look, if
you wear a red ribbon in your hair everyone knows what that means and will
leave you alone. Come on, come and have some fun.�

&nbsp;

Reluctantly Lisa agreed to go. She felt bloated and ugly
and just wanted to go back to bed and curl up with a good book but Judy was
insistent and, at the end of the day, if Judy had made her mind up, that's what
happened. They loaded the cool box in the boot of the car and drove out to
Charlotte�s house deep in the Mendip hills. Judy chatted all the way, trying to
lighten the mood but Lisa just sat there glumly staring out of the window. She
knew she was behaving like a spoilt child, and normally this would lead to a
sound spanking, but she couldn�t seem to lift her spirits.

&nbsp;

Charlotte�s house
had all the privacy money could buy, tucked away in a little valley surrounded
by woods. She�d bought it after her fifth novel had topped the bestseller lists
and her publishers had paid her a huge advance on the sixth. Although Lisa had
been there a few times she had never seen much of the gardens but if they were
as grand as the house then they would be spectacular. 

&nbsp;

They arrived at the gates and buzzed the intercom to be let
in. The gates swung open and they swept up the drive to park in front of the
house. Sally came out to meet them. To Lisa�s surprise she was wearing a light
cotton dress. As they had only met on Friday evenings Lisa had never seen her
in anything but bondage gear before.

&nbsp;

�Hi. Come on round. We�re all set up on the lawn.� As Lisa
got out of the car Sally spotted the decoration in her hair. She went over and
gave her a hug. �Lovely to see you. Shame about the ribbon, but it�s good of
you to come.�

&nbsp;

Charlotte�s back lawn was part of a beautifully laid out
formal garden facing south to catch the sun. In the centre of the grass was a
selection of rugs and the hampers that they had all brought. Everyone was
helping, laying out the blankets, sorting out the food, making sure the white
wine was properly chilled. For the first part it was just a normal party, eight
women enjoying the meal, the wine and the sun, relaxing together, taking
pleasure in each other�s company. Eventually the bulk of the picnic was gone
and the last remnants were being packed away in Tupperware containers. Susan
and Jane took the used plates inside. Charlotte announced that she had planned
some pony trials and Sally went off to fetch the equipment.

&nbsp;

Even if she hadn�t
been indisposed, Lisa was not sure that this was her cup of tea and, in her
present state, she really wasn�t interested. Charlotte and Christine had got
involved in some rather technical discussion whilst getting Sally in harness
and this was getting on Lisa�s nerves. She took one of the rugs and went off to
find some peace and quiet. She now knew that the others would leave her alone,
respecting her inability to join in.

&nbsp;

The sun was warm,
she�d drunk just enough wine, and her book was less than enthralling so it was
no surprise that Lisa fell asleep. It seemed like only ten minutes but it must
have been much longer than that when she was woken by a gentle shake of the
arm.

&nbsp;

�Lisa, Lisa, sweetie, you�d better put on some sun block,
your arms are getting awfully red.� Jane, still dressed in some complex
arrangement of leather straps, had come over and was, as ever, acting the
mother hen. Lisa was grateful, she had begun�
to burn, and of all the company, the one she felt she could relax with
at the moment was Jane. The cream was cool and pleasant against her skin, the
sleep had done her good, and she was in a mellow mood. She was therefore quite
pleased when Jane stayed to chat.

&nbsp;

�So, how did you and
Ruth get together?� Lisa asked after a while. 

&nbsp;

�Hasn�t Judy told
you? It�s quite a story.�

&nbsp;

�No, she�s never said a thing.�

&nbsp;

�Well, I used to be into self bondage.� Jane started. �That
was quite a few years ago now, I�d not been with anyone for a while and it was
a nice way to get my kicks.�

&nbsp;

�What did you do?�
Lisa was intrigued.

&nbsp;

�I'd tie myself up, handcuffs, ankle restraints, all the
toys, but with the keys somewhere where I couldn�t get to them for a while. The
ice cubes in a stocking trick was my favourite, lying there helpless, waiting
for the ice to melt, it�s hard to understand but it�s quite a thrill, believe
me. Part of the thrill is that you might get caught, not that you really want
to, but, well, you know what I mean� Anyway, the house I lived in at the time
had a small conservatory at the back, nothing too grand, but if I did it in
there I was overlooked by the neighbour�s houses. It was perfectly safe during
the day, everyone was out at work, and I could fantasise about being seen
without there being any real risk, or that�s what I thought. It was also nice
and warm, which was comfortable for me and helped the ice to melt.

&nbsp;

�So, there I was, a
lovely sunny afternoon, perfectly quiet, I�d taken the day off work and was
looking forward to a nice long session. I stripped off, hung up the stocking
and got into my gear. I was lying on the couch, trussed up like a turkey when��

&nbsp;

�Hello, I wondered where you�d got to.� Ruth appeared. �Had
enough of the games?�

&nbsp;

�I was just telling Lisa about how we met.�

&nbsp;

�Hah! There�s a day I won�t forget in a hurry. How far have
you got?� Ruth plonked herself down next to them.

&nbsp;

�Just started.� Jane replied. �Well, there I was, trussed
up like a turkey, enjoying the sun, enjoying everything really, when��

&nbsp;

�Hey, let me tell this bit.� Ruth interrupted. �You know
I�m a builder, well, we�d got this roofing contract. Perfect day for it, and
I�m up on the roof when it�s time for a cuppa. Rather than join the bunch of
Neanderthals I�m working with I stay up there to get a bit of sun with my tea
and a ciggie. I�m looking about, enjoying the view when I see Jane, trussed and
bound, in the next-door conservatory. I nearly fell off the roof, reckoned I�d
come across some mad sex crime or something and it�s time to phone the police,
but I felt I ought go and take a butcher�s first. I nip down the ladder, hop
over the fence, and bang on the door. If it is some sort of sex crime then I�m
ready for it, just let me get my hands on him! But when I bang on the door��

&nbsp;

�Oh my God! How
embarrassing! I would have died on the spot.� Lisa interjected. She hadn't
wanted to butt in, she didn't want to break the flow, but this was incredible.

&nbsp;

�Embarrassed! I
wished the ground would swallow me up.� Jane replied. �I know that getting
found out is part of the fantasy but when it actually happens� I was also quite
scared, after all, I was hardly in a position to defend myself if anything
happened. I wasn�t gagged so I shouted out �Go away! Please, I�m Ok��

&nbsp;

�Go away! Not bloody
likely.� Ruth continued. �I�m no rapist but when there�s a little cutie all
wrapped up like a birthday present, I�ll be blowed if I�m just going to walk
away. I popped open the conservatory door, it was locked but it�s easy if you
know the trick, and there she was. I looked around, saw the keys hanging from
the ice cube in a stocking, and I know what that means all right, we�re not
expecting anybody in quite a while. I�m on a break but it won�t last long and I
don�t want the fellas getting an eyeful so I explain this to Janie and help her
into the house where it�s a bit more private; believe me that took some doing,
she�s a bit of a lump, aren�t you dear? Then I hop back over the fence and tell
some load of bollocks to the foreman, sick mum, that sort of thing, and I need
the rest of the day off. So, once more, over the fence and into the house I go.
I give Janie a safe word, to make sure that she gets it that I know the score
and let the games begin��

&nbsp;

�You should see it
from my point of view.� Jane cut in. �Part of the fantasy is to be interrupted
by a tall dark stranger, but I get this whirlwind in dirty overalls who storms
in and takes over. One moment I�m lying back, wallowing in it, the next I�m at
her feet and she�s dangling the keys and taunting me. I�m not sure if it�s my
dream come true, or my nightmare. Still, it looked like she knew the game, and
she�d given me a safe word, so I thought, what the hell, let�s see where this
one goes.�

&nbsp;

�So, there I am, a
cute little sweetie all bound up before me, and I hold the keys. I�m not
going to rush this one, am I? I plonk myself down on the sofa and light up a
ciggie while I think about things. There she is, all �please don�t smoke in the
house�, but I reckon, no safe word, no dice. She�s got all her toys laid out,
obviously not expecting anyone, so I start to go through them, teasing her
about the number of vibrators she�s got, and how big and fat they are. I try
out one or two, running them up and down her pussy lips, which makes her squeal
a bit. By now I�m getting all hot and sweaty, overalls are great for
work but they�re not exactly indoor gear, and I am getting dirt and dust
all over her nice furniture, so off they come, them and my Doc Martins.�

&nbsp;

�That�s when I fell
for her. This scrawny little thing, all skin and bones, in her tee shirt and
briefs, standing over me. Why you were only twenty at the time.� Ruth nodded in
agreement. �All that raw energy, I just wanted to take her in my arms and give
her a cuddle.�

&nbsp;

�You couldn�t
though, could you? That�s the point.� Ruth laughed. �By now I�ve found some
nipple clamps so, on they go. I can tell they�re quite stiff so they must have
hurt like billy-oh but all I get from her is a few squeaks. Oh, I think,
quite the little pain slut, and if that�s what she likes then I�m in for some
fun. So I kneel down in front of her and give the clamps a little tweak and
at the same time give her a long sloppy kiss.�

&nbsp;

�I�m in seventh heaven.� Jane took over the story. �Ruth�s
being a bit hard on my nipples with the clamps but I love that, it�s such an
intense feeling, and when she really starts to tug, I�m nearly coming on the
spot. And the kiss, so much passion, I�d never been kissed like that before. I
was gutted when she broke away.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, then she�s giving it all the Please, please don�t
hurt me, please I�ll do anything!� Ruth�s voice was a parody of Jane�s.
�But I�m not having any of it. Just to make sure I reach down and cop a feel of
her pussy, is she wet or what! But then I�m thinking she�s getting all the
thrills and I�m not, and that ain�t right, so I pulls away and sits back down
on the sofa. Now I�m reckoning she�s got to be into bondage, look at the way I
found her, but solo bondage you�ve always got to leave a bit of room for
struggle otherwise you can�t get yourself out of it, key or no key. For real
bondage it takes two, and that�s where I come in. I look at all the toys she�s
got and there�s plenty I can use so I make a deal, I tie her the way I
want to do it or it�s game over, I was pretty sure it was a dead cert.�

&nbsp;

�Well, I wasn�t
going to say no, was I?� Jane took over, smiling at the recollection. �This
demon goddess descends out of nowhere, barges uninvited into my house, takes me
to the brink of orgasm, and then threatens to leave if I don�t indulge in my
favourite fantasy, I didn�t hesitate for a moment. I�m busy trying to stay in
role and play the fearful virgin whilst inside my hormones are raging.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, I�m on to all that.� Ruth chuckled wickedly. �Well, we
take off all the old clobber and it�s on with the new. I start off with a nice
thick collar with a strap down the back to hold the wrists. That�s always good
because with the hands behind the back it makes the tits stick out and Janie
here has got a nice looking pair and I intend to spend some serious time there.
Then I put her ankles in a leg spreader and get her to kneel down. A bit of
rope between her wrists and the spreader and she�s held, kneeling upright, legs
apart, pussy wide open, ready for action and can�t move an inch. I guess she�s
a bit uncomfy but that�s the name of the game, ain�t it, Janie?�

&nbsp;

Ruth snuggled up to
Jane and nuzzled against her breast; she was obviously getting turned on by
telling the story. By the expression of pain that crossed Jane�s face, and the
grunt that followed, Lisa assumed that Ruth was using her teeth and quite hard
by the look of it.

&nbsp;

�To top it all off,�
Jane continued, �She gagged and blindfolded me. Now I love that, there�s
something about being gagged and blindfolded that makes the sense of
helplessness more vivid and there I am with a total stranger, unable to protect
myself from whatever she wishes. It doesn�t get much stronger than that. Then
she starts on my breasts, at first I thought she was just going to kiss them
but she starts biting me, ahhh, a bit like she is now. Oh, she�s good at
that; she takes me just to the limit of what I can take, ahhh, and maybe
a little more. A few minutes of that and it�s as if my nipples were on fire,
they�re inflamed and they�re sensitive and the slightest touch is setting me
off, let alone the bites she�s giving me, ahhh. And then I feel her hand
reach down there.� Ruth's hand headed south, as if to illustrate the point. �At
first I thought she was just going to stroke me but she gripped my clit between
her fingers and squeezed. God, did she squeeze. I was in agony, sheer delicious
agony.�

&nbsp;

�And loving every second of it!� Ruth detached herself from
Jane�s breast. �I could tell what pressed your buttons. So now I reckon it�s my
turn. I undo the rope from the back and tie it from her collar, down the front,
to the leg spreader. This pushes her face to the floor, where I want it, but
also that cute bum of hers goes up. I loved that bum from the moment I set my
eyes on it and I wasn�t going to let an opportunity like that pass by. There�s
some butt plugs in her toy collection and I assume she wouldn�t have them if
they weren�t there to be used. So I pick a nice big fat one and pop it in.�

&nbsp;

�Pop it in!� Jane exclaimed laughing. �She�s found the
biggest plug I�ve got, put the slightest smear of lubricant on it, and forced
it into me followed by several good slaps with a paddle for good measure. I�m
there, face to the floor, my poor bruised nipples are rubbing on the carpet, my
clitoris is throbbing like nothing on earth, my bottom is battered and bruised
and it feels like I�m passing a bowling ball! The next thing I know she�s
scooted round the front, removed the gag, sat down on the floor in front of me
and my face is where it belongs, deep in her groin.�

&nbsp;

�Oooh, �deep in her groin�, you don�t �alf talk posh.� Again
Ruth mocked Jane�s accent. �She�s there, licking my pussy like a good un, and
when it comes to licking pussy there�s no one like my Jane. She�s lapping away
and I�m loving every minute of it. I give her a bit of encouragement, and in no
time it�s chandelier swinging time for me, I�m coming like there�s no tomorrow,
my fruit machine�s hit three lemons and no mistake!�

&nbsp;

�By �a little encouragement� she means the foulest torrent
of abuse I�d ever heard.� Jane explained. �It�s odd, if someone called me a �slag�
or a �fat, ugly cow� under normal circumstances it would really hurt, but when
I�m deep in sub mode it�s all part of the turn-on.�

&nbsp;

�So, that�s me sorted, but I�m never one to leave a lady
wanting, and now it�s her turn. She�s still there with her bum in the air, I
slip on a strap-on, come round behind her and in it goes.�

&nbsp;

�So delicately put
as ever, my love.� Jane cut in. �As Ruth says, there I was, backside in the
air, my nipples hurt, my clitoris hurt, my buttocks hurt and my bottom felt
like it was going to explode, I�d been tied up and humiliated, and now I was
being thoroughly rogered in the most brutal way possible, all in all, my idea
of heaven. I lost count of the number of times I came before she let me go.�

&nbsp;

�So what happened next?� Lucy was agog.

&nbsp;

�I�m no good at the
lovey-dovey bits.� Ruth continued �I�d had my fun, she�d had her bit of rough,
nobody had any complaints, so I put on my overalls, untied her enough so she
could do the rest, and slipped out the door. Thank you very much I
thought, bye! Next thing I know there�s a call to the office, some old
girl wants building work doing and insists on that �nice young lady builder
working on the roofing contract�. I nip round to see what�s what and it�s guess
who with no building work anywhere to be seen.� 

&nbsp;

�I wasn�t going to let her slip off in the night.� Jane
added. �I knew we were meant for each other. Ruth took a bit of persuading, but
I�m hers now.�

&nbsp;

�How long ago was this?� Lisa asked, amazed at their story.

&nbsp;

�Oh seven years next October. October 14th
wasn�t it?�

&nbsp;

�You�re the one for dates. I told you I don�t do
lovey-dovey stuff.� Ruth was gruff and sounded somehow embarrassed. �Now give
us a kiss.� 

&nbsp;

As they cuddled together Lisa noticed that it was Ruth who
cuddled into Jane, rough, tough Ruth who snuggled into Jane�s welcoming hug, to
be held and comforted like a child. For a moment or two they lay there, content
in each other�s arms, each providing their partner's needs, the perfect couple,
happy together. It was Ruth who pulled away first.

&nbsp;

�Come on, Janie,
let�s go and see how Miss Posh Bint is getting on with her pony cart. Lisa
wants to be left to read her book.� Ruth and Jane got up and headed back to the
others. For the first few steps they were hand in hand, until Ruth snatched hers� away. Jane turned back for a second and gave
Lisa a wink, a wink and a smile, something to do with a secret shared.

&nbsp;













The months rolled by and Lisa and Judy settled into a steady routine living together, happy to share their bed and their lives. Christmas came and wentwith Lisa travelling back to Manchester to spend Christmas day with her parents, but&nbsp; she pleaded work commitments, and returned back to Bristol on Boxing day. It hadn't felt right, she loved her mum and dad, but she wanted to share the day with Judy. They had agreed to save their presents to each other until Lisa came back, but it just wasn't the same.

Christmas at her parents house had been a strain for Lisa. Firstly she wanted to tell them all about her new life but she had to hide the bit that had become central, the thing that made it special. Mum and dad were, after all, rather old fashioned and she didn't feel that the time was right to tell them just yet. Secondly she was worried about her dad's hacking cough which had got much worse, she really wished he'd give up smoking, and he seemed to wheeze as he breathed. As she travelled back to Bristol she couldn't help being torn between her love for Judy and her love for her dad, if he was as ill as he looked then surely she should be near him.

February was hard that year, and March was no better. As the winter storms battered the house Lisa and Judy would snuggle down togethr beneath the duvet. It wasn't that the central heating was inadequate, it was just that, in such inclemant weather, the warmth of a lover was far, far better than the warmth of a radiator, waming the soul as well as the bones. 

Then came the fateful Thursday. Judy was reading as Lisa watched a cookery show on the television., when the phone went. Judy answered it but passed it to Lisa.

"Lisa, it's for you, it's your mum."

Judy watched in concern as Lisa face went white. Whatever the phone call was about Lisa hardly spoke, but she was shaking as she fought back tears and her face told half the story. When she was finished she put the phone down and turned to Judy.

"It's my dad, he's in hospital, they don't thing he's got very long."

"Right, let's go and pack, I'll drive you there." Judy spoke calmly.

"But... But, it's two hundred miles." Lisa couldn't believe Judy would just drop everything like that.

"I know where Manchester is, come on, he sooner we leave the sooner we're there. Let's go upstairs and pack." They went upstairs threw some clothes into a couple of overnight bags. Judy was very concerned, she'd never seen Lisa this close to the edge, she was obviously fighting back tears. She wasn't sure if they were going for a day or a week so she packed for the latter; better safe than sorry.

The M5 and M6 were mercifully clear of traffic as they drove through the night, even the stretch past Birmingham was not too bad so they made good time arriving in Manchester in the early hours of the morning. However, when they got to Lisa's parents house it was dark and unoccupied so they went on to the hospital, and after a number of enquiries, found Lisa's mum sitting in a waiting area, her face a picture of worry. As they entered she looked up, and seeing Lisa rushed over ahd hugged her.

"Oh, Lisa, Lisa, my little baby, thank heavens you could make it. It's not good, he's dying love, he's dying."

"Oh, mum. I came as quick as I could. Can I see him?" Lisa asked.

"Of course, he's asleep now, but they'll let you go in.. Here, I'll show you the way." Lisa's mum took her onto the ward and left her at her fathers bedside before returning to the waiting area and introduced herself to Judy.

"Hi, I'm Lisa's mum, Molly. And you are?"

"I'm Judy, Judy Ford, Lisa's landlady. I'm so sorry that we had to meet under these circumstances."

"No, no, thank you for bringing her. Lisa was always close to her dad. I'm so glad she was able to&nbsp; make it. Was the drive..." She was interupted by Lisa's&nbsp; wail of pain. Molly dashed to the ward with Judy close behind. The flat lines on the heart monitor said it all so Judy, respecting their privacy, drew back to wait in the lobby. As she left the ward a nurse entered with that brisk businesslike walk they use when they're in a hurry. For maybe half an hour Judy sat and waited, idly reading the public health leaflets to pass the time. She wanted to be there for Lisa, to help ease her pain, but she knew this was not her time, Lisa needed her mother. Eventually Lisa and Molly appeared, holding each other, mother and daughter united in grief. Judy took them to the car and drove them home.

Despite the lateness of the hour they couldn't sleep and the three women sat and talked for a while. Judy said that she would go and find a hotel but Molly was having none of that and insisted on making up the spare room. 

"It will give me something to do." She said. "I need something to do."

"Lisa, love." Judy asked once Moly had gone. "Do you want me to go, I'm kind of in the way."

"No, no, please don't go. I'm sure mum can put you up. Please, please..." Once again Lisa's tears ran down.

"Of course I'll stay if you want me." Judy replied and went to put her arm around Lisa. They were like that when Molly returned. They broke apart awkwardly.

"Fourty nine years, fourty nine glorious years. Your dad was so looking forward to our golden wedding. He had all sorts of plans." Molly said as she sat down. "You were a menopause baby, you know, thought my child bearing days were over and then, pop, there's another one. Our little gift, that's what your dad used to say, you were always his favourite, you know."

"Oh mum." Lisa was slightly embarrased but if it gave her mum comfort to talk, then let her talk. Their conversation rambled over all the memories that families have, best holidays, good times together, the shared experiences that bind. Before long Molly had got out the family album on the excuse of showing Judy pictures of Lisa as a child, but one picture led to another and Judy was forgotten as mother and daughter remembered together. At five in the morning exhaustion got the better of them and the three women went off to their separate beds.

The next few days were filled with sorting out all the trivia that comes with a berievement. The funeral was fixed for Monday and Judy agreed to stay up and help. A few phone calls to her office put all the immediate business on hold, and she, and her car, were an invaluable aid as they got things ready for the wake.

Lisa's mum and dad were not very religious and the funeral was quiet and functional. Judy sat at the back, explaining that she wasn't family and didn't want to intrude. The priest said the usual platitudes, more functional than meant, and, to the strains of 'My Way' Lisa's dad's coffin slid between the curtains and he was no more.

Wakes are curious affairs. On the one hand there's the inevitable sadness, the sense of shared loss, shared grief. On the other hand it's a time when distant parts of the family meet and there's lots of 'my, haven't you grown' and 'we must get together soon under better circumstances&#8217;. Judy felt left out, the only people she knew were Lisa and her mother who was having to act as hostesses. To give herself something to do she slipped into the kitchen and busied herself with the washing up. She was half way through when Molly appeared holding a stack of dirty plates.

"You're fond of Lisa, aren't you." She asked as she put down the plates.

"Yes, she's a sweet girl, a perfect lodger." Judy replied.

"No, I mean really fond of her." Mollys tone was more insitant.

"Er, yes, I'm fond of her."

"Are you sleeping together?"

"What!" Judy was toatlly nonplussed at Molly being so forthright. "I think that's a question you should ask Lisa."

"Well, I'm asking you. Are you sleeping with my daughter?"

"I'm sorry, I really do think tha's a question for Lisa." Judy was feeling cornered. She hated lieing but she wasn't going to out Lisa to her mum.

"And I'm still asking, are you sleeping with my daughter?" There was a silence, neither woman prepared to back down.

"Yes, yes she is mum." Lisa had appeared at the door. "Judy and I are lovers."

"I thought so. I just wanted to make sure. Is this the real thing?" Lisa and Judy looked at each other. 'Is this the real thing' was a question each had been avoiding for quite a while.

"Yes, Molly, this is the real thing. I've never felt this way about anybody before. I love your daughter and want to take care of her for the rest of my life." Cards on the table time. Judy thought to herself.

"Oh Judy, I love you too, I love you so much." Lisa went and kissed Judy full on the lips.

"I knew it, I knew it from the moment you arrived. Mind you I've had my suspicions for a while. Never a boyfriend, and whenever you phone it's Judy this, Judy that. I know the signs, even if it is a bit unusual."

"And you don't mind?" Lisa was taken aback, and still not sure of her mum's response.

"Lisa, my love, when I married your dad his folks were dead set against it. I wasn't good enough for him or so they said. But if forty nine years together taught me anything then, if you love each other, that's all that matters." She turned to Judy. "Look after her, if you hurt her you'll face a mothers wrath, but you have my blessing, both of you. Best not tell you're Auntie Josie though, you know what she's like. And Judy, you don't need to bother with the spare room tonight. Right, I've got to see to our guests, are there any more nibbles anywhere."

As she left Lisa and Judy looked at each other, totally amazed.

"I do love you, really I do." Judy said at last

"And I love you too."
