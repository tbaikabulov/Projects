Bed and Bondage





The room is warm, almost too warm. I am slightly damp from perspiration, and the 

occasional draft makes me shiver.



The room is filled with a warm, diffuse light, sunlight through heavy lace 

curtains, giving the place an antique feel. The air smells of potpourri, mingled 

with red wine and musk.



My eyes travel lazily along the ceiling, until they reach the far wall, where a 

full-length mirror stands across from the foot of the bed, tilted slightly 

forward in its heavy oak frame. The image staring back at me from the mirror 

commands my attention: a exquisite brass four-poster bed, and on it a beautiful 

woman, naked, her arms stretched tautly over her head, and her legs reaching out 

toward the posts at the foot of the bed.



That's me, with my wrists bound together by that long purple band of silk. 

That's me, chest rising and falling more quickly than usual below tight, shiny 

skin. That's me, lying there on the new beautiful bed we shopped for for so 

long, and bought just for this purpose. That's me... finally. Absorbed as I am 

in the image of myself, Robert's voice startles me. "You certainly are a 

beautiful sight, love." I turn my attention to him, as he stands by the side of 

the bed, a glass of wine in his hand, smiling warmly down at me.



"Robert, kiss me..." I start to say, but he leans over me, and presses his 

finger to my lips, and says, "Shhhh. Not a sound."



But he kisses me anyway, lightly, gently, on the lips. He takes a sip of the 

wine he is holding, then dips his finger into the glass. With his wet finger, he 

traces my lips, then bends over and licks the wine from my lips. His 

feather-light touch makes me shiver.



He continues with the wine, drawing his finger from behind my ear to the hollow 

of my throat, then following with his tongue. He traces a line down between my 

breasts; the evaporating alcohol is cold for a moment, but his tongue is warm 

and soft. Mmmmmm.



I was unaware that I had actually made a sound, but Robert warns me again, 

"Silence..."



And so I am silent, eager to please my lover and to make this moment perfect for 

both of us.



A drop of wine on the left nipple, which hardens instantly, before he licks it 

off with a mere brush of his tongue. And then the same to the right nipple. His 

light, fleeting touch has awakened my sensitive nipples, and they cry out for 

more. I arch my back toward his mouth, but he has already moved on to other 

places.



A drop of wine on the soft underside of my arm. A almost-tickling lick along my 

navel. A wet trail along the crease where my thigh meets my body. Each touch a 

brief spark that awakens and arouses a new part of my body, just enough to tease 

but not enough to satisfy.



He licks a trail of red off of my inner thigh, and I can't contain my gasp. My 

whole body feels alive, itching for his touch. I want him to lick up, up, to 

move his tongue between my legs, but he's gone again, standing next to the bed, 

watching my flushed form on the bed. I look up at him, pleading with my eyes, 

Robert, Robert, touch me...



"How can I resist those eyes?" he asks, with mock mournfulness. "You don't 

really want me finish yet, do you?" My body cries yes, but at the same time I 

savor the delicious frustration, and I know the answer. The question is 

rhetorical.



Robert goes to the dresser by the bed, and returns with another broad band of 

soft purple silk, like the ones that bind my wrists and ankles. This one he 

drapes across my eyes, then lifts my head and ties it expertly in place.



The removal of vision heightens my other senses. I become aware of the sound of 

cars in the distance, and the wind in the tree outside the window. I become 

aware of the smell of Robert and the smell of me. I smile and relax, delighting 

in hypersensitivity of my body and the feeling of anticipation.



I am not disappointed. Robert starts touching me again, returning to the top of 

my body. He strokes my face with his fingers, and his touch is firmer now, more 

demanding, more satisfying. He holds my hair, grasping it. Holding my head 

firmly, he kisses me on the lips, deeply this time; no more fleeting touches, 

this time his kiss is filled with passion, and I meet it with my own.



He breaks the kiss too soon, and leaves me gasping for air. Now he is rubbing my 

body with smooth, firm strokes. He rubs my shoulders, my arms, my sides, my 

belly. He rubs my breasts, and this time when I arch toward him, he doesn't pull 

away. Instead, he holds them, kneads them. He grasps my nipples between his 

fingers, first lightly, but with increasing pressure. A moan escapes my parted 

lips, but Robert doesn't seem to mind; instead of a warning, he pinches my 

nipples firmly and tugs, and I am suddenly dizzy from the pleasure.



Forgetting my situation, I reach up to wrap my arms around him, but the strip of 

silk holds my hands tightly to the bar between the posts at the head of the bed. 

Straining against the bonds accentuates my frustration and longing, and I moan 

again.



Robert continues pulling on my nipples, till they reach a point just short of 

pain, and my back is arched as far up as it will go. Once again, he breaks his 

hold too quickly, but before I have a chance to feel disappointed, he replaces 

his fingers with his mouth on my left nipple, sucking it in, pressing it between 

his tongue and teeth, rolling it around with his tongue.



My breath is quick and ragged now, as I strain towards him. He grabs both 

breasts in his hands, and shifts his mouth to the other nipple. Oooooh. It feel 

so good. And then he stops.



He pauses, just long enough for the frustration to register on my face, and then 

he resumes his broad hand strokes on my belly, and sliding down to my thighs. He 

draws his hands down the outside of my legs, to my feet. He rubs each foot with 

his palms, with just enough firmness to avoid tickling me. He rubs each toe with 

his thumb and draws his fingers along my instep. Then he moves his hands back up 

my legs, on the inside this time. His broad, smooth hands stop inches before 

where my thighs meet.



No, don't stop, Robert...keep going...up, up, please. But I don't have to say 

anything. He knows how badly I want him to touch me there, but instead he 

massages my thighs. Each stroke brings him a hairsbreadth closer to my nether 

lips. I strain against the bands on my ankles, but they hold my legs apart, 

making me feel exposed and ready for his touch.



He strokes gently the line where my outer labia meet my thighs. The touch is 

light and agonizing. And now he leans forward, and I can feel his warm breath 

against my clit, stirring the wispy hair there. He blows against me, and the 

coolness against the moisture there makes me jump. I arch toward him, but he 

still doesn't touch me inside; he just keeps maddeningly stroking my outer lips.



He stops. Just as I am about to start begging him to touch me, he brushes my 

exposed clit with another one of his quick, fleeting touches. The touch is an 

electric shock through my body.



It is gone in an instant, but every muscle in my body tenses in that instant, 

straining for his touch. After a moment, my breath returns and my muscles start 

to relax, and he touches again, briefly, sending new waves of pleasure through 

my taut body. Oh God, how much more of this can I stand? Please, please, keep 

going, don't stop, Oh God, don't stop...



He stops. Again I start to relax, and this time I feel his tongue, pushing its 

way between my folds. Carefully avoiding my clit, he licks around the foreskin. 

He gently sucks my labia into his mouth, rubbing his tongue along the underside. 

Then the other.



Then around the clit again. Then a quick flick of his tongue across the tip. I 

gasp, realizing that I have been holding my breath. Again, the same electricity 

courses through my body. Another moan.



After some more teasing, Robert licks my clit again, this time firmly. He draws 

his tongue in circles around the head, and then sucks it into his mouth, 

pressing it between his teeth and tongue.



Yes, yes! Holding my clit between his lips, he flicks it with increasing tempo 

with his tongue. Then he sucks again, and for a timeless moment I am held on the 

brink, as a washing, tingling pleasure starts to spread from between my legs up 

my back.



He stops. The tingling recedes. No, no, don't stop! He lightly pinches my 

thighs, and I realize that this time I've actually spoken. I continue to plead 

with him, Robert, Robert, don't hold me here, touch me, touch me... I can't see 

his face with my make-shift blindfold on, but I know he is smiling. That's what 

he was waiting for.



With that, he slips a finger inside me, and I start thrusting eagerly against 

his hand. His thumb rubs my clit, lightly but with increasing pressure, as the 

rate of my thrusting increases. He slips another finger in, and starts his own 

thrusting, faster and faster, pressing against my clit, rubbing it, teasing it. 

I feel the tingling sensation start again. Please, Robert, let it happen...



and he keeps thrusting. Suddenly my whole body is awash with pleasure. I see 

white light behind my eyelids, and every muscle in my body convulses. My legs 

strain against the soft restraints but I have no awareness of being tied down. 

For a brief, timeless moment I am floating, my entire being centered around 

Robert's thrusting hand.



And before I land, before my convulsions subside, Robert is on me, and in me. He 

thrusts with such ferocity, such passion, that he keeps me floating. 

Unbelievably, the pleasure intensifies.



The entire world consists of me and Robert, pounding, thrusting, crying out in 

pleasure, floating. I think I scream, but I'm not sure. The aching, insistent 

pleasure lasts forever, and I hear Robert's own growling gasps as he joins me on 

my exquisite plane of pleasure. Yes, Robert, Robert, I love you!



Slowly the pleasure subsides, the convulsions become less intense and further 

apart. My body relaxes and I become aware of Robert's weight lying heavily on 

top of me, of the ties that still bind my wrists and ankles. Without getting off 

me, Robert slips the blindfold off over my head. As I knew it would be, his own 

faced is flushed, his hair in disarray. Still staying in me, he reaches up and 

unties the strip of cloth that holds my wrists together, and I bring them down 

and wrap my arms tightly around him.



For a long time we stay that way, my lover's weight against my body, my arms 

holding him close. For a long time we lay in our beautiful new bed, recovering 

from its first use. Hopefully the first of many.
