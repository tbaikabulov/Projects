KATIE&#8217;S RED WAGON
�by Alex B.

�The moment Katie Bingham opened her purse to pay for lunch,
�she knew she was in big trouble. The problem stemmed from
�the fact that this was not the purse she normally used,
�it was sort of a spare. Unfortunately, the last time she&#8217;d
�worn it, she put some important papers inside and then
�forgot all about them.

��Great!� Katie sighed.

�Her workmates, Rachel and Liz, looked up from their desserts.

��What is it?� Rachel asked.

��I&#8217;m totally busted.�

��Relax,� Liz chimed in. �If you forgot your wallet, we can
�cover the check.�

��Thanks,� Katie said, giving her friend&#8217;s hand a pat.
��But that&#8217;s not it. I just realized I forgot to send in
�our car insurance payment.�

��Uh-oh! Bill&#8217;s not gonna like that!� Rachel chided, waving
�her fork as she spoke.

��I know. I&#8217;m going give him a call and get it over with.�

�Katie reached into her purse and took out her cell phone.
�She pushed a few buttons then put the receiver to her ear.

��Bill Bingham.� her husband answered.

��Hi, it&#8217;s me. Listen... I&#8217;m in kind of a fix.�

��Are you okay?�

��Yes, I&#8217;m fine. I just... well, you know how I was supposed
�to mail that insurance payment?�

�Bill waited a moment before speaking.

��You mean for the cars?�

��Yep.� Katie squeaked, scrunching up her face.

��That was nearly a month ago!�

��You hate me, right?�

��Seriously, Katie! That means we&#8217;ve been driving around
�without insurance for weeks now! All you had to do was
�write out a check and mail it in!�

��I know. I&#8217;m sorry. I just-�

��No... it&#8216;s okay. I&#8217;m at my computer right now. I&#8217;ll go
�to the company website and if the grace period hasn&#8217;t
�already passed I&#8217;ll make a payment online.�

��Thanks, baby.�

��No problem. But you know, I&#8217;m going to paint your wagon
�bright red when you get home.�

�Katie paused for a moment and then laughed as if she
�understood Bill&#8217;s little joke.

��I get it! Okay, I&#8216;ll see you then. Bye.�

�Katie turned the phone off and carefully tucked it back
�into her purse.

��Is he pissed off?� Rachel asked.

��Not really. You know Bill, he&#8217;s a big teddy bear. He did
�say something kind of strange, though.�

��Strange?� Liz inquired.

��Yeah. He said he was going to paint my red wagon or
�something like that.�

�The two other women looked at each other and then burst
�into laughter.

��What?� Katie said, wanting to be in on the joke.

�Liz simply waved the question off, but Rachel was quick
�to respond.

��Well, I don&#8217;t know how to tell you this, girlfriend,�
�she said with a smirk. �But you&#8217;re in for a spanking.�

�As the women walked the four blocks back to their office,
�Katie lagged a few steps behind her friends until she
�eventually slowed to a halt.

��You&#8217;re just kidding about that red wagon stuff, right?"

�Liz and Rachel stopped and turned around.

��Of course! She&#8217;s just kidding.� Liz replied calmly.

��Like hell!� Rachel said. �Whenever my mother told me she
�was gonna paint my wagon, I got my bottom tanned real good!
�And if my daddy said it, I&#8217;d be doin' the strap dance in
�no time!�

�"The what?" Katie asked.

��Okay, cut it out now!� Liz told Rachel.

��What?! It's that little dance you do while you're bawling
�your eyes out after a butt whippin'."

�Rachel then demonstrated by hopping from foot to foot and
�rubbing her rear end as she pretended to cry.

�"You are so ridiculous!" Liz giggled as she looked around
�to see if anyone was watching.

�The next few hours found Katie at her desk trying to
�concentrate on her work. But Bill and Rachel&#8217;s words
�kept echoing in her head and now she was starting to
�remember her husband referring to her bottom as a
��little wagon� on several occasions.

��Get your little wagon in here!� he&#8217;d said, folding back
�the sheets and covers at bedtime. Quite often, Bill had
�stood behind her in the kitchen, admiring her fanny.
��You have the cutest little wagon.� he&#8217;d say.

�It wasn&#8217;t so little, actually. By magazine standards,
�Katie&#8217;s rump was oversized. In reality, however, it was
�simply full, round and womanly.

�And now her husband was going to paint it bright red.

�Recollections of spankings she&#8217;d received while growing up
�played like old movies in her mind and though she never
�felt permanently scarred by these experiences, they were
�not fond memories. Katie shifted around in her chair as if
�the seat was growing hotter with every thought of a hand
�or hairbrush smacking her tender bare bottom.

�At five o&#8217;clock, Katie attempted to make a quick exit from
�the office in the hope of avoiding Rachel.

��Off to the woodshed, huh?� Her friend called out from the
�copying machine.

�Katie displayed her best fake smile and gave Rachel a
�dismissive wave as she headed out the door.

�The traffic she encountered on her drive home may have been
�slow, but Katie&#8217;s mind was racing.

�She stared at the rear end of the station wagon directly
�in front of her and couldn&#8217;t help but notice the color.

��Bright red.� she whispered.

�The fact that Bill had used these words worried her, because
�he wasn&#8217;t a half-way kind of guy. If he started in on
�a project, he kept at it until it was finished. When they
�played cards or a board game, he played to win. So it
�naturally followed that, if the man she loved was going to
�spank her, it was bound to be a bona fide bottom-scorcher.
�It wouldn&#8217;t be some playful display of ass smacking, but a
�full-fledged, over-the-knee extravaganza with real swats,
�authentic tears, and no small amount of true humiliation.

�Katie&#8217;s buttocks clenched as she imagined her husband
�standing in the doorway of a woodshed, paddle in hand,
�motioning for her enter.

�She made a grab for her cell and speed-dialed his number.

��Hey there.� Bill answered.

��Hi. So, what are you doing?�

��Nothing. Just sitting here at home, waiting for you.�

��Well, I&#8217;m on the way.�

��Good.�

��Um... listen,� Katie started, her mouth going dry as
�she spoke. �Am I really in trouble here?�

�Bill waited a moment before answering.

��What do you think?� he said.

�Katie swallowed hard.

��Oh... okay. I&#8217;ll see you soon.�

��Love you.�

��Love you, too.� Katie managed to say before turning off
�the phone.

�Katie was finally resigned to the fact that she was in for
�the spanking of a lifetime, because nothing Bill said meant
��yes� more than the words: �What do you think?�. From the
�first time she&#8217;d asked if he wanted to fool around to that
�morning when she saw his sleepy face at the breakfast table
�and asked if he wanted some coffee, �What do you think?�
�always translated into: �Do you even have to ask?�

�By the time she pulled into the driveway, Katie&#8217;s mind was
�swirling around like an ice cube in a delicious cocktail
�made from equal parts of raw anxiety and animal lust
�with just a drop of dread.

�She opened the front door to find Bill standing in the
�front hallway.

��Do remember that spanking fantasy you had-� he asked.
��The one you talked about when we saw that old movie?�

�Katie had to think back, but it didn&#8217;t take long.

�Once, while they were cuddling on the couch after watching
�a black and white classic on television, she&#8217;d told Bill how
�much she liked it when the handsome leading man threatened
�to take the spoiled heroine across his knee. She then went
�on to confess that she&#8217;d often daydreamed about a strong
�man pulling her across his lap and spanking her like a
�misbehaving child. When Bill asked if she wanted him
�to spank her right then and there, she declined explaining
�that only under the right circumstances, when she really
�had it coming, could she accept that sort of treatment.

��Oh, yeah.� Katie said, her knees going week at the thought
�of her husband recalling such a brief, intimate moment.

�One of the many qualities that endeared Bill to Katie was the
�way he remembered everything about her. If she mentioned
�a fondness for a certain kind of wine or food, that&#8217;s what
�she&#8217;d soon find on their dinner table. Bill remembered every
�place on Katie&#8217;s body she liked massaged and every place not
�to tickle her. He&#8217;d even developed a knack for renting the
�videos she&#8217;d most enjoy. And when it came to sex, he always
�knew just which buttons to push, especially the ones nobody
�had ever touched.

��Well, I think it&#8217;s time you got that spanking.� Bill said,
�folding his arms across his chest. �What do you think?�

�Katie&#8217;s eyes darted down to his shoes. She then glanced up
�to Bill&#8217;s face again. He didn&#8217;t look very angry. In fact,
�even though his expression was quite stern, a subtle smile
�seemed to be forming at the corner of his lips and his
�eyes greeted her warmly.

��Yes, Sir.� Katie heard herself say as she placed her purse
�on the small table next to the front door. She caught a
�glimpse of herself in the hall mirror and seeing the blush
�that had come over her face sent an electric chill
�throughout her entire body.

�Bill pointed into the next room.

��In there, young lady.� he commanded.

�Katie took a deep breath and somehow managed to put her feet
�into motion. She stepped hesitantly in front of her husband,
�half expecting a sharp swat to her backside as she passed.
�Instead, she quietly entered the living area to find that
�Bill had placed one of the armless chairs from the dinner
�table in the center of the room. She felt a sudden jolt.
�It was Bill taking her by the wrist and pulling her to
�the chair. Placing Katie to one side, he seated himself
�and looked up at his breathless spouse.

��You need to have your little wagon painted bright red!�
�Bill stated. �And I&#8217;m just the guy to do it for you!�

�With that, he hooked his right arm around Katie&#8217;s waist
�and hauled her unceremoniously across his lap.

�Katie was shocked, not just by the swift forcefulness Bill
�displayed in taking her over his knee, but by the fact that
�he&#8217;d used, word for word, the exact dialogue spoken by the
�leading man in the old movie they&#8217;d watched. Before she could
�ponder whether he&#8217;d gone out and rented the film in order to
�reenact the scene, she felt the first of many stinging
�swats to her upturned fanny.

�The slaps fell hard and fast onto the seat of Katie&#8217;s modest
�silk skirt. She gasped at the severity of one particular
�smack that caught her off guard just as she&#8217;d placed her
�hands on the floor in an attempted to make her position
�slightly less precarious. This thundering whack was quickly
�followed by another and another, each a bit harder than
�the last. Soon Bill was administering the kind of walloping
�his wife had both cringed at and craved.

�Katie hissed and yelped with every smack to her tender,
�quivering buns. Her eyes filled with tears. Her round,
�swelling buttocks burned as if she were sitting in a bowl
�of hot water. Her face burned as well and the tears that
�trickled down her blushing cheeks did nothing to wash away
�the shame. Katie wasn&#8217;t prepared for the feelings she
�was having. Being spanked so soundly was painful of course,
�but it was the embarrassment of the situation that seemed
�impossible to withstand. Bill had yet too bare her bottom
�or use an implement on her and here she was already crying,
�already squirming and beginning to kick. The humiliation
�was overwhelming and yet it was this very factor she seemed
�to hunger for more than anything. It was like a tonic,
�frightfully bitter to the taste but healing in effect.

�Bill&#8217;s firm hand continued to deliver heated kisses to his
�wife&#8217;s reddening fanny, driving her deeper into the world of
�salty tears, sizzling flesh and an intoxicating sense
�of complete disgrace.

�Soon after Katie had fallen limp over his lap and her cries
�had become pitiable blubbering, Bill decided to bring the
�spanking to a close. He stopped swatting and instead applied
�a firm yet soothing massage to her raw, red, aching ass
�until she was done sobbing.

��Okay, now stand up.� he said, giving a Katie a pinch to
�grow on.

�Katie pushed herself from Bill&#8217;s lap and reached back to
�grab two handfuls of that wonderful burning sting in her
�throbbing ass cheeks. Then she unbuttoned her blouse
�and opened it until it slid down her arms and fell to
�the floor. Her bra, shoes and skirt were next.

�Bill stood as he watched his love push her panties down
�past her knees.

��What are you doing?� Bill asked. �Nobody goes bare ass
�in one of those old movies!�

�Katie kicked her undies off toward the couch, took her
�husband&#8217;s face in her hands and planted a long, passionate
�kiss on his lips.

��We&#8217;re not in a movie, sweetheart.� she panted. �I want the
�full treatment.�

�Having said this, she pushed Bill back into the chair and
�threw a few locks of hair over her shoulder before laying
�across his lap once again.

��Are you sure?� Bill asked.

��What do you think?� Katie replied, wiggling her bare,
�pink bottom as she spoke.

�Bill lifted his hand and began spanking his wife just as
�before and yet this was a completely different experience
�for Katie. Now that she&#8217;d been warmed up and the initial
�shock had dissipated, she could enjoy it all on an
�entirely different level. Her husband was swatting away
�with every ounce of strength he&#8217;d used earlier and now
�that she was naked, the smacks stung that much more,
�but Katie was loving it. With anxiety removed from the
�equation and shame no longer an obstacle to her pleasure,
�she not only welcomed the blistering heat of every swat,
�but eagerly lifted her bottom for more. Mrs. Bingham had
�had acquired a taste for this medicine and was quite
�willing to beg for another spoonful.

�A few tears still escaped her eyes, but Katie was no longer
�crying out but grunting and moaning as she pressed and
�rubbed herself against her husband&#8217;s leg. Bill gave both
�of Katie&#8217;s thighs firm squeezes between powerful spanks
�and soon his hand was venturing upward to tease her
�glistening sex with the tips of his fingers. Katie was
�delirious with the rush of differing sensations. She found
�herself squealing, then groaning, then giggling as her
�hubby alternated between slapping her ass and tickling
�her pussy. Before long, the swats were arriving a good
�fifteen seconds apart, each slightly weaker than the one
�before, with a good deal of finger play in between.

�Without warning, Bill stopped everything and pulled Katie
�from his lap as he stood up.

��I&#8217;m not done yet! You've got something else coming to you!"
�Taking her ear between his thumb and index finger, he lead
�Katie to the corner of the room near the bookcase. "This is
�a good place for a bad girl to take a time out."

�Katie looked at Bill in disbelief and then bowed her head.

�"Yes, Sir." she sighed, heading into the corner.

�Then Bill stepped forward, blocking her path.

�"You are not bad, however. Not by a long shot.� He lifted
�Katie&#8217;s chin so that they were looking directly into each
�other's eyes. �You&#8217;re just a little forgetful sometimes.
�That&#8217;s no so bad, is it?�

�"No, Sir." Katie answered, barely able to breath.

�Their lips met and they kissed with complete abandon.
�Eventually, Bill managed to push himself away for a moment.

�"Now ditch that &#8216;Sir&#8217; business and march yourself into
�that bedroom, young lady! Like I said- you've got something
�else coming to you!"

�Katie did as she was told.

��You are talking about fucking the hell out of me, right?�
�she asked knowingly as she entered the darkened bedroom.

�Before the question had completely left her lips, Katie heard
�the distinct sound of a zipper being lowered followed by
�four very familiar words:

��What do you think?�

�THE END
