Chapter 1 - Jack�s Plan

It was time.&nbsp; He needed to get a girl before winter set in.&nbsp; Until now, his entire focus had been on improving his large cabin, getting it equipped for Her; even making it entirely self-sufficient, and completely off the grid.&nbsp; He wanted no traceable links to mainstream society.

The transformer panel from the solar panels and the wind mills he had bought and installed produced a satisfactory hum as daytime power was accumulated.&nbsp; �Power, sewage, water, and heat all finished,� he thought with satisfaction as he entered his dungeon for a final inspection.&nbsp; �The cage is ready, that�s probably the most important item,� he whispered.&nbsp; His eyes moved around the room, making sure his new toys were in proper order.&nbsp; With a silent nod of approval, he turned off the lights and climbed the stairs to ground level.

At his favorite south-facing window, he sat down at his small work desk and considered, �Where to go?&nbsp; I�ve been too busy working on the details to decide on the big picture.�&nbsp; Deciding to squander some of his precious electricity to help direct his quest, he powered up his laptop and flicked the switches to enable his small aperture satellite terminal to lock in his internet connection. 

�It has to be far away from here, so know one will know,� he mused as he shifted his way across an interactive map.&nbsp; �Yes, � Utah.�&nbsp; He chuckled, �That�s definitely my best chance for gathering up a virgin.�&nbsp; It was the work of a few keystrokes and he had a room booked in Provo, Utah for a week.

�Tomorrow, my adventure begins.�

The next day dawned sunny and bright as he loaded his specially equipped Cessna Caravan.&nbsp; The amphibious craft was one of his prized possessions and sole lifeline to civilization and survival should something unexpected occur at his remote cabin location.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only after carefully following his pre-flight checklist did he start the thundering engine.&nbsp; Once his instruments confirmed his engine was idling to perfection, he threw off his mooring line, climbed up into the cockpit, and began taxiing across the icy cold blue waters of his private bay to line up his Cessna for takeoff.

The light chop made for an uneventful takeoff and soon he was in the air�with his next stop Anchorage.&nbsp; He knew from experience that the green wilderness that passed below would soon be inundated with months of snowfall and bitter cold.&nbsp; This trip was just in time because he intended to be fully enjoying his new slave before the first blizzard of the season.&nbsp; He grinned happily as he set the autopilot for the next leg of his flight; his long-awaited quest for the perfect slave was underway.&nbsp; 

After a quick landing in Anchorage, he traded planes and�got in his small jet.&nbsp; Again, he painstakingly reviewed his pre-flight checklist before radioing the tower for permission to taxi.&nbsp; He couldn�t help but wag his wings after liftoff.&nbsp; �Another step closer,� he thought eagerly.

As expected, the commercial air section at the Provo, Utah airport was quiet.&nbsp; In the office, he arranged for refueling and reminded the staff that he didn�t need any other servicing.&nbsp; �I want the bird ready to go at a moments notice,� he told the staff.&nbsp; �My schedule is uncertain so get my return flight plan to Anchorage registered so I won�t be delayed.�

It was noon, so he decided to go on the prowl.&nbsp; �A mall is the first place to go,� he thought.&nbsp; �There�re always young coeds in malls.�&nbsp; Before parking his rental�car in the mall parking lot, he cruised around the entire mall checking for security cameras on the rooftops.&nbsp; Satisfied that there was a large zone uncovered by security, he parked his car and walked as close to the mall in the blind zone as he could.&nbsp; �They won�t associate me with the car,� he thought with satisfaction.&nbsp; �It�s not likely I�ll grab Her directly, but it�s best to be prepared.� 

Sooner than he thought possible, he saw Her out of the corner of his eye.&nbsp; Her long sunset red locks immediately drew his attention.&nbsp; Then, after seeing Her beautiful emerald-green eyes, he had to have Her.&nbsp; She was the goddess of his dreams, five feet seven inches of chiseled muscles topped with a beautiful face.&nbsp; He locked eyes with Her as he slowly changed direction, focusing directly on her table.&nbsp; 

Awkwardly, he bumped against the nearest table with a clatter.&nbsp; He reddened in embarrassment and hurriedly spoke, "Oh, � sorry.&nbsp; It seems I�m always stumbling over myself when I see a beautiful woman."

When she didn�t immediately reply, he added, �I'm Jake.&nbsp; What's your name?�&nbsp; Inwardly, he winched at the crude first contact and promised himself he�d be smoother if she gave him a second chance.&nbsp; He continued to smile down at the girl, mesmerized at her youthful perfection.

The young woman, Jaslyn Brooks, was bemused at his stumbling approach but couldn�t help but tell herself, �Wow!&nbsp; He�s handsome!�&nbsp; Then she blushed at her inner thoughts and whispered to the man, �My name is Jaslyn.�

"Mind if I sit down before I fall again?" Jake asks with his smile broader than ever.
�
�Sure,� she giggles and inwardly flinches again.&nbsp; �He must think I�m an idiot,� she thought.

Unaware that Jaslyn�s inner turmoil mirrored his own, Jake managed to chat a bit with the young beauty.

She reveals to Jake that she�s twenty-two, a college senior, and studying nursing.&nbsp; Jake tells Jaslyn that he�s twenty-eight, already graduated from college with a degree in mechanical engineering and that he�s interested in settling down in a rural area in Utah.

�Everything I told her is basically true,� he thought, �except for using a fake last name and misleading her about where I actually live.�

�Wow,� Jaslyn told herself, �it must be nice to be a trust fund baby.&nbsp; It sounds like he has lots of hobby interests.&nbsp; He mentioned outdoor living, off road adventuring, and an interest in building a cabin off grid here in Utah.� 

�I have to be careful about revealing major clues about myself like my being a pilot and owning aircraft,� he reminds himself as they talk.

Abruptly, Jaslyn realizes that she�d been at the mall far too long.&nbsp; �I�m sorry, Jake, but I must leave; I have class in an hour!"
 
The abrupt shift in conversation reminded Jake about his true task.&nbsp; �It�s now or never,� he told himself.&nbsp; �I�ll never find a better candidate than this girl!�

"Would you go out with me tonight?&nbsp; Please, � money is no object, this has been such fun for me and I�d like to continue our discussion over a great meal.&nbsp; This trip, I'm only in town a week for a few morning work meetings.&nbsp; I really don't want to eat alone,� he literally begged.
�
Jaslyn thinks, �Why not, my class load has been killing me and I deserve a break.&nbsp; Besides,� she adds with a blush, he seems so awkward, he must be nice.�&nbsp; While the thoughts race through her head, she ignores the image in the back of her mind about how he obviously must have a lot of money.

"Sure,� she says eagerly, �let me give you my phone number and address.�&nbsp; As she writes her information down she adds, �I�ve heard the Melting Pot is a great restaurant but haven�t been able to afford it because of my limited budget.&nbsp; I�m pretty sure reservations are required, so it might be too late for tonight.�

Jake chuckles, �No worries, I'll get us in.&nbsp; I�ll pick you up at 7 tonight?"

"Perfect!� she said, not really believing that she�d accepted a stranger�s offer for dinner.&nbsp; �I�m sure he�s fine,� she reassured herself as she hurried out of the mall.&nbsp; �He acted like he hadn�t had a date in years.&nbsp; He kept blushing every time I looked at him, � it was kinda cute that he was so unsure of himself.�&nbsp; 

Jake had done a lot of thinking while he waited to pick up the young girl.&nbsp; While he was embarrassed at his inept introduction to Jaslyn, he was canny enough to realize that it likely worked to his advantage.&nbsp; �If I was too smooth,� he told himself, �she�d have pegged me as a young businessman looking to bed a local girl while traveling.�

�But,� he told himself sternly, �you better focus on the mission!&nbsp; She�ll never be mine if I�m too openly linked to her.&nbsp; I don�t need any law enforcement nosing around afterward.&nbsp; Be careful, Jake!�

Silently anticipating her reaction to his surprise, Jake knocked on the door of her apartment.&nbsp; After parking, he�d carefully avoided being noticed by anyone and made it to her door without encountering anybody.&nbsp; �So far, so good,� he thought.

Jaslyn opened her door and felt a quiver in at the sight of the handsome Jake filling her doorway with a huge assortment of long-stem fire and ice roses.&nbsp; �Flowers,� she told herself quickly, �I haven�t been given flowers since my high school prom and that was far too long ago!�

"Wow!&nbsp; You look so beautiful!� Jake exclaims.

�Are those for me?� Jaslyn asks coyly.

Jake takes the opportunity to step into her apartment and he grins, �Roses for a rose!�

She takes the flowers and can�t resist burying her nose in the bundle, drawing in their pungent smell.&nbsp; �Hmmm,� she whispers, �wonderful!&nbsp; Thank you so much!�

�Oh, but these roses don�t compare with your beauty,� he answered.&nbsp; �Corny,� he thought, �but She expected some sort of compliment.�

While Jaslyn scurried back into her kitchen, Jake surreptitiously pulled Her phone from the purse sitting on an entry table and quickly popped off the battery to silently kill the device.&nbsp; In just a few seconds, the now turned off phone was back in her purse.

Relaxing now that the first part of the evening has gone according to plan, he is able to appreciate the beautiful dark purple dress she chose to wear on their date.&nbsp; The dress was cut to accentuate her narrow waist and then snuggly fit across her hips, ending just above her knee.&nbsp; 

�Hmmm, � no hose and sensible heels,� he thought.&nbsp; �I wonder how silky her thighs will feel?&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I can hardly wait to find out.�

"Let�s get going; reservations are at 8:30 and it�s an hour ride.&nbsp; You ever ride in a jag?"

She looks at the sleek silver car and her chin drops. "Wow!&nbsp; Are you for real?"

"I�love fast cars and beautiful women," he smiles.

�She�s easily distracted,� he thinks with an inward smirk.&nbsp; �She won�t be thinking of this stupid car when I pop her oh so carefully guarded cherry.&nbsp; The challenge will be to get her to cum before I get my cock in her for the first time.&nbsp; Then the inexperienced cunt will feel guilty that she enjoyed our first rape.�

Outwardly Jake maintained his cheerful demeanor and he laughs, �My company said I could �chose any car I wanted to rent� so I decided to think fun and sporty.�

She shakes her head in wonder at the amazing car.&nbsp; �Wow!� she repeats as she slips carefully into the car.

Jake carefully watches to see if Jaslyn inadvertently flashes him as she swivels her legs into the car.&nbsp; He�s a bit disappointed he didn�t get a flash of her panties.&nbsp; He gently closes her door and heads around the back to the driver�s side.&nbsp; �But, I got Her!� he whispers aloud as he gives himself a mental �high five.�

Dinner is pleasant and each relaxes as they laugh and enjoy the good food and company.&nbsp; Jake discovers a lot about her background without revealing too much about himself.&nbsp; Finding that he likes Jaslyn a lot causes a momentary twinge of guilt at what is in store for the innocent woman.&nbsp; Jake hardens his resolve and reminds himself this is the culmination of months of long work and hundreds of thousands of dollars.&nbsp; �Just think of her as your private cunt,� he tells himself.&nbsp; �She will live solely for my pleasure.�&nbsp; Then a bit more fiercely, he adds, �She won�t have a choice!&nbsp;&nbsp; Her freedom will soon be gone forever.�

The one oddity that he noticed was that she didn�t want wine, beer, or a mixed drink.&nbsp; Instead, she was content to drink cranberry juice and mentioned trying to avoid carbonated drinks.&nbsp; �I do enjoy coffee and tea,� she admitted as if it were a vice.

After he ordered desert, she excused herself to go to the ladies� room.

As she walked away, Jake smoothly swept her glass off the table and set it on his lap.&nbsp; He dumped a finely ground white powder into her glass and used his spoon to dissolve the drug into her drink.

The chocolate fondue strawberries were delicious but a bit sweet.&nbsp; Jaslyn drank all her tart cranberry juice and laughed at the perfect complement of sweet and tart between the desert and her drink.

Jake sipped his red wine and enjoyed watching every drop of drug tainted cranberry juice pass her lips.&nbsp; �Soon,� he thought with eager anticipation.

Jake paid cash for the meal and slipped his arm under his date�s.&nbsp; As they strolled out, he whispers, �I have more surprises my beautiful rose.&nbsp; Shall we go?" 

"Sure," she answered while stifling a yawn.&nbsp; �What�s up next, � a rocket ship ride to the moon?�&nbsp; Then she laughed and added, �No, tomorrow�s a school day.&nbsp; The moon trip will have to wait for a weekend date.�

When she realized she�d implied she truly liked Jake and hoped for another date, she giggled and leaned against him as they walked.

Jake laughed back and said, �Well, I was thinking something more normal like a movie back in Provo.&nbsp; But maybe we can ride the rocket on our next date.�

This time, Jaslyn sat down on the seat of the Jaguar under the increasing influence of the drug cocktail Jake had slipped into her drink.&nbsp; The deliberate way she swung first one leg and then the other into the car forced the bottom of her dress to climb high enough up her thighs to almost reveal her panties.

Jake sighed at how close he�d come to discovering what color and type panties such a conservative young woman would wear on a first date.&nbsp; �Soon,� he whispered as he ran around the back of the car.&nbsp; 

Only moments away from the restaurant, and well before he reached the freeway, Jaslyn drifted off to sleep.&nbsp; The soft music playing on the radio helped lull her into a deeper sleep where the drugs would now prevent her awakening.&nbsp; A quiet snore from the passenger side of the Jaguar brought a grin to Jake�s face.

Ignoring what he�d mentioned about a movie, Jake headed directly toward the airport.&nbsp; On the way, he rummaged through Jaslyn�s purse and made sure the cell phone was still off and that no other traceable electronic devices were in the purse.

There was little traffic and he made rapid progress.&nbsp; At the airport, he used his gate pass at the private aircraft terminal and drove right up alongside his jet.&nbsp; I was well into the evening and long past sunset.&nbsp; Unloading his prize was a simple task.&nbsp; Jake buckled Jaslyn into a seat and cuffed each of the captive�s wrists to an armrest.&nbsp; She slept on not knowing that her life had just changed forever.
 
He locked the jet and used baby wipes to wipe down any of the surfaces of the car that he or the girl had come in contact with.&nbsp; The rental was then parked at the airport�s rental car return.&nbsp; The keys and rental form went into the after hours lock box.&nbsp; Satisfied that fake, but fully functional credit card would get charged for the rental, Jake walked back to the other terminal.&nbsp; He still had a long flight ahead.

She was still sleeping.&nbsp; Just in case she awoke, Jake set a small kit bag on his copilot�s seat that had items to help subdue Her if She woke at an inopportune time.&nbsp; He finished his preflight, taxied out of the hanger, and contacted the tower for a take-off slot.

The return to Anchorage was uneventful except that he was exhausted by the time he landed.&nbsp; To ensure he could sleep, Jake pulled up her dress, and rubbed alcohol on her rump.&nbsp; The syringe contained sedative to make sure she would sleep while he took a nap.&nbsp; Pleased with the belated discovery about her choice of underwear, Jake eased the filmy red panties under her butt and down her legs.&nbsp; He drank in her scent and sighed deeply in appreciation.&nbsp; �Hmmm, a true redhead,� he whispered as he pocketed the underwear.&nbsp; Delaying playtime for later, Jake reluctantly drew the hem of her dress over her red bush and curled up alone on a sleeping bag laid in the aisle way.&nbsp; He fell asleep dreaming of her still hidden charms.

Waking was difficult.&nbsp; The quiet musical tone of his phone alarm woke him, � but he was still groggy.&nbsp; The cool, almost freezing, air outside the jet quickly changed that; he was wide awake before his bags were stowed in the Cessna.&nbsp; Moving Jaslyn was less exciting than he�d hoped.&nbsp; It was awkward trying to gently move her form wrapped in a blanket down the narrow stairs of his jet and up into the cockpit of the Cessna.&nbsp; He growled in frustration, �I really want to start playing with my new toy.�

Certain that she�d awake something during the long and rough ride to his cabin; he fitted specially made cuffs to her ankles and wrists.&nbsp; After padlocking the cuffs in place, he slipped a padlock through the last link of a short chain already anchored to the floor and then locked that into the �D� ring of an ankle cuff.&nbsp; Three padlocks and three chains latter, Jaslyn was firmly attached to the plane and virtually a part of the copilot�s seat.

Hungrily, he drank in Her slim form, the full mounds of her breasts under the now wrinkled dress, and reluctantly turned away.&nbsp; �I want her fully awake when she�s undressed for the first time.�&nbsp; Humming happily, he cleaned the jet, locked it up, and began the pre-flight checklist for the Cessna.

By now, over half the day was twilight so when She started to stir, it took Jaslyn some time to orient herself.&nbsp; 

Jake had already noticed the young woman stirring.&nbsp; �This should be fun,� he thought.&nbsp; He engaged the autopilot and loosened his seatbelt.

The expression on her face told it all!&nbsp; Shock, horror, and then understanding flickered across her face after she recognized him seated beside her.&nbsp; 

�Jake what's going on?" she demanded.

Surprised that She hadn�t panicked yet, Jake leaned over and calmly slapped Her face; hard.&nbsp; �From now on, you will call me Master!� he declared in a in a loud, firm voice.&nbsp; �Do, you understand?�

Jaslyn could only stare back at him open-mouthed in amazement.

�Stupid, slut!� he muttered as he backhanded the other side of Her face in an equally hard blow.&nbsp; Before she could recover, his other hand drew an arrangement of rings and straps toward her head.&nbsp; The bemused woman didn�t resist as he jammed an oversize leather-wrapped ring into her mouth behind her front teeth.&nbsp; He had the ring-gag�s head straps tightened and buckled in place before she could react.

�Huuhhhh!� was her protest.

Jake grinned at his captive and slipped a cock gag through the ring-gag and strapped it in place.&nbsp; He couldn�t help but laugh at her look of bovine helplessness with the gag in her mouth, eyes wide open in alarm, and the straps to dehumanize her beautiful face.&nbsp; He kissed her forehead.&nbsp; �We�ll talk later slave.&nbsp; I�m busy now.�

�Mmmffff,� her muffled shrieked of anger slipped past the cock gag set deep in the back of her throat.&nbsp; Furious, Jaslyn lurched about trying to free herself.

Now buckled up again, Jake leaned over and spoke loudly over the engine and airstream noises, �That�s twenty-five for unruly behavior.&nbsp; I would advise you control your anger and breathing so you don�t earn too much punishment or excite yourself to the point of vomiting.&nbsp; With that gag, vomiting could be deadly.�

�What?� she screamed inwardly.&nbsp; �Slave!&nbsp; Punishment!&nbsp; What the fuck is he talking about?�

Jake slipped a headset over Jaslyn�s head and adjusted the fit.

Locating the intercom switch, � and double checking that he was nowhere near the radio transmit switch, Jake keyed the mic and spoke in a normal voice.&nbsp; �First, your mic is off, so shut the fuck up!&nbsp; Secondly, yes, � you�ve been abducted and you are already far from home and civilization.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your old life no longer exists.&nbsp; Lastly, � you live only to serve me; as my slave, � my slut, � my whore, � whatever I want, � you will do nothing but strive to please me, your Master.�

�If you understand, nod.�

Jake sighed when Jaslyn shook her head in denial.&nbsp; �That�s twenty-five more,� he voiced into his mic.&nbsp; �Don�t be stupid, you cunt!&nbsp; Nodding indicates you understand my comments, not that you agree with me.&nbsp; One last time, � nod if you understand.�

This time, Jaslyn nodded.

"Good!&nbsp; I believe you are starting to get the picture. We will be landing soon so enjoy the scenery and welcome to your new home, � Alaska.�

Chapter 2 - Arrival

�Alaska?� Jaslyn asked herself in horror.

She turned away from her kidnapper and stared out the window to her right in dismay.&nbsp; The view she saw was unrelenting wilderness.&nbsp; Her eyes moved from snow-capped mountains, to rough terrain covered in towering trees, to rivers rushing over boulders and rocky ravings, and lastly to lakes that were evident in abundance.&nbsp; There were no signs of roads, electrical or telephone lines, developments, or even any man-made objects.

�He must be telling the truth, � it is Alaska.&nbsp; But, � how did we get here?� Jaslyn wondered.&nbsp; Then, she added up the blistering headache pounding in her forehead and her dry, swollen mouth.&nbsp; �He drugged me!&nbsp; The rat bastard drugged me!�

Out of the corner of his eye, Jake saw his new acquisition suddenly writhe about.&nbsp; �She�s finally getting it,� he thought.&nbsp; �Good, let Her realize that She�s completely dependant on me, her Owner and Master!�

�Hmmph!� Jaslyn tried to shriek.&nbsp; She wiggled again; her attempts were stymied by the aircraft harness and cuffs on her wrists and ankles.&nbsp; �Hmmph,� she shrieked again, this time in frustration.

Jaslyn stilled and forced herself to examine her bondage when her stoutest efforts resulted in no loosening of her strictly controlled situation.&nbsp; �Cuffs, � the fucker has locked cuffs on my wrists.�&nbsp; She twisted her right wrist slightly and confirmed that a small, shiny padlock held the cuff�s tongue locked tightly in place.&nbsp; A larger, temporary padlock connected the �D� ring of the cuff to a short section of chain.&nbsp; �My feet must be chained the same way.�&nbsp; Another thought intruded on her mind.&nbsp; �He�s thought this out!&nbsp; Has he kidnapped other women?&nbsp; Is he a mass murderer?&nbsp; Oh, God!&nbsp; Oh, God!&nbsp; I�m such a fool!�

Jake had kept most of his attention focused on his new slave.&nbsp; Since, the little Cessna was on autopilot, he pretended to be absorbed in flying but wanted to see how Jaslyn adjusted to the realization of her situation.&nbsp; When he saw her eyes widen and her nostrils flare quickly in and out he readied himself to intervene.&nbsp; Tears began to streak her cheeks and bubbles of snot erupted from her nostrils.

�Shhhh,� Jacklyn heard in her headset.&nbsp; She opened her eyes and saw Jake looking into her eyes.&nbsp; He tenderly wiped tears off her cheeks and squeezed a tissue over her nose.&nbsp; �Is he concerned?� she thought with surprise.&nbsp; The back of one hand caressed her cheek.&nbsp; �What?� she asked herself.

�If you�re completely quiet, � I�ll take out the gag.&nbsp; Nod if you agree.�

Jacklyn�s tongue was cramped by the intruding gag and the dryness of her mouth was concerning.&nbsp; She nodded quickly.

Jake loosened the single strap holding the fat plug in her mouth and eased it out of the ring gag.&nbsp; That left the leather harness over her head and the ring jammed behind her front teeth.&nbsp; Jake smiled in amusement because he was certain Jacklyn didn�t realize the ring gag would remain in place, for awhile at least.

Jacklyn tried to snarl at Jake in displeasure when she discovered her cramped jaw wasn�t going to get relief.&nbsp; 

Jake only smiled back and whispered into his mic, �Remember our deal, � I expect calm and quiet.�&nbsp; At her silence, he nodded and added, �Good, slave.�

Jake�s lips brushed against Jacklyn�s forehead and he whispered, �I need to talk and you need to pay careful attention because your happiness, health, and even your very life depend on you understanding our relationship.�&nbsp; He traced the open maw of her mouth with the tip of a thumb.&nbsp; �Understand?�

Jacklyn nodded.

�Good!&nbsp; First, I�m sure you noticed that we are miles from another human being.&nbsp; In fact, from our destination it�s over 50 miles to the nearest cabin.&nbsp; And, that�s only a hunting lodge that�s used a few months of the year.&nbsp; They do some fishing and some big game hunting.�

By now, Jack�s hands were rubbing Jacklyn�s neck and caressing her hair behind her ears.&nbsp; Jacklyn resisted the urge to shake her head and try to dislodge his hand.

Jack tightly grasped a handful of Jacklyn�s hair and drew her head back.&nbsp; His voice toughened.&nbsp; �The situation is that it is just me and my little fuck toy miles and miles from the nearest people.&nbsp; If I get hurt, � you die a lonely death out here.&nbsp; Remember, only I can get into our food stores, only I can access the plane and turn on its controls, there is no phone, there is no radio, our internet access is limited and only I can get our vsat terminal tied into the internet.&nbsp; There�s much more, � but do you understand that without me, � you die alone out here in remote Alaska?�

Jacklyn felt a tear slip down her cheek.&nbsp; She nodded her head.&nbsp; The string of drool that escaped on the downward nod brought a flush of embarrassment and anger as well.

Jake relaxed his grip on her hair and took a second to kiss her open mouth.&nbsp; Jacklyn felt his warm lips search around the big oval created by her lips.&nbsp; She also felt his breath across her tongue.&nbsp; The dazed woman kept her tongue far away from Jake�s as he explored around the inside of her mouth. 

�So,� Jake spoke and Jacklyn started.&nbsp; �I was lost in his touch,� she muttered to herself in wonder and a bit of anger.&nbsp; �What kind of idiot am I to enjoy his touch?&nbsp; He�s a kidnapper and soon enough, he�ll be a rapist as well!�

�Second,� Jack spoke in a clear and commanding voice.&nbsp; �You are my slave and I am your Master.&nbsp; That means that I now own you!&nbsp; You are property, � my property!&nbsp; As such, I will use you however I wish; however it pleases me!�

�Understand?�

Jacklyn closed her eyes as the enormity of what Jake said sunk in.&nbsp; Eyes still closed, she slowly nodded.

�Good!&nbsp; Within that context, I can be your teacher, your best friend, your lover, � or the very devil himself!�&nbsp; 

Jake�s voice had risen and harshened as the described himself as the devil.&nbsp; Jacklyn gulped and told herself, �Yes, � he certainly intends to add rapist to his list of crimes.�&nbsp;&nbsp; She heard something about pain and quickly focused all her attention back to what he was saying.

�You�re learning.&nbsp; Good!&nbsp; As my slave, there will be pain to focus your attention, pain to correct your errors and improve your learning, and of course, there will be pain if true punishment is deserved.&nbsp; However, if you are an ideal slave, student, and lover, � then there will be pleasure; pleasure enough for us both.� 

Jacklyn stared into her captive�s eyes and thought, �Yes, he does care for me.&nbsp; But, � Jack the Master cares for his slavegirl not for Jacklyn the college student with all of her life ahead of her.�

�Bastard!� she thought.

�Later I�ll explain the rules.&nbsp; But for now, � obey and don�t resist or attempt to escape.&nbsp; If you can remember those guidelines, we�ll get along nicely.�

The engine droned on and the air rushed past the cockpit.&nbsp; The unrelenting noise lulled Jacklyn and she relaxed.&nbsp; At some point, she slipped into a light slumber without any real intent to rest.

A huge jolt awoke her.&nbsp; �Are we crashing?� she wailed in fear.&nbsp; �We�re underwater!�&nbsp; Then, the Cessna shuddered again and the water covering the cockpit slipped away.&nbsp; �We�ve landed, � on the water.� Jacklyn thought with amazement.&nbsp; Outside, she saw a small bay covered in whitecaps. 

�We�ve landed!� Jake declared in an amused tone over her headset.&nbsp; �It�ll take a lot more time than normal to get situated because I won�t be tying off at my floating dock.&nbsp; Since this is my last flight of the season, I�ll be stowing away the Cessna for the winter.&nbsp; You can stay in your seat while I�m working and think about your role in my little family.

When the door opened, the blast of cool air that rolled inside brought an instant chill to Jacklyn�s breasts.&nbsp; Looking down, she realized her drool had completely soaked the top of her dress and even her bra was wet.&nbsp; �Bastard!� she hissed inwardly again.&nbsp; She struggled once again to get loose.&nbsp; �No chance at all to escape,� she moaned.&nbsp; When the Cessna jolted, Jacklyn looked out the forward window and saw they were slowly moving backwards, away from the edge of the water.&nbsp; In a moment, she saw a set of tracks appear under the front of the little airplane.&nbsp; �He�s taking the plane out of the water,� she wondered.&nbsp; �Winter is too severe to leave a plane on the water.�&nbsp; She shivered at the thought of the coming snow and ice of a near-arctic winter.&nbsp; Tears started to pour out of her eyes.&nbsp; �He�s right!&nbsp; The bastard does control my very life.&nbsp; I can�t possibly escape even if winter weren�t coming.�

Outside, Jack was carefully watching that the Cessna tires stayed inside the �U� channel tracks that ran down the slope from his sheet metal hanger to the edge of the bay.&nbsp; A hand-held wired remote control ran inside the hanger where a 12,000 pound winch slowly but surely inched the Cessna up the incline to its winter home in the hanger.&nbsp; A set of deep-cycle batteries ganged together operated the winch and everything electrical in the hanger.&nbsp; All batteries at Jack�s remote site were recharged from sets of solar panels and a wind turbine.&nbsp; Power generation was especially difficult in the winter with ice and snow buildup threatening the solar arrays unless they were carefully maintained.

Once in the hanger, Jack checked the outside temperature; it was 40 degrees.&nbsp; �Yes, a beautiful day,� he grinned.&nbsp; �Jacklyn will have at least two weeks before the first winter storm arrives.�

Jack loaded his bags and gear from the Cessna onto a small trailer behind one of his four-wheelers.&nbsp; He approached a wall-mounted heavy steel storage cabinet and entered a passcode onto a digital pad.&nbsp; The door unlocked and Jack selected a set of keys and an electrical control module.&nbsp; The ignition key was for the four-wheeler was on the ring; however, without the electrical control module plugged into the wiring harness, the four-wheeler�s engine couldn�t start.

Jack also drew out of the cabinet a small tote bag.&nbsp; Jack grinned at the images evoked by the bag�s simple contents.&nbsp; �Time to start,� he chuckled aloud.

Jacklyn looked up and watched the Cessna inch backwards under a building.&nbsp; Her eyes needed a minute to adjust to the sudden shade.&nbsp; �We�re here,� she thought with resignation.

Warily, she watched her captor enter the cockpit.&nbsp; Silently, he knelt down in the cramped confines of the cabin and slipped a slim cable around the narrowest portion of her waist.&nbsp; A click indicated it was locked in place.&nbsp; She had no choice but to cooperate, Jack kept her tightly controlled as he slipped one wrist free only to lock it to the waist chain.&nbsp; She trembled as she was manhandled.&nbsp; �He knows what he�s doing,� she told herself in horror.&nbsp; �He�s either done this before, or he�s practiced somehow.�

Jacklyn realized that while still belted into the seat, her feet were now unchained.&nbsp; A momentary surge of hope surged through her being.&nbsp; �I can run away,� she thought eagerly.&nbsp; Then, as he tugged her up from her seat and guided her to the open door she realized, �But, � there�s nowhere to run.�&nbsp; Crushed, she was led out of the plane and the sudden move of being pushed down on her knees brought her back to full awareness of what Jack was doing.

She quickly looked around and saw she was in a garage or hanger that had three overhead doors and three storage bays.&nbsp; �He�s got snowmobiles, four-wheelers, jet skis and lots of other gear.&nbsp; Maybe I can bide my time and escape later.�&nbsp; Her spirit raised, she stared directly at Jack and wondered what was next.

�You should notice that you are kneeling.&nbsp; That is a slave�s position that pleases me.&nbsp; It shows respect and subservience.&nbsp; When not performing a task, this should be the position you assume.&nbsp; Nod if you understand.�

Jacklyn, nodded.

�You should also notice that I�ve pushed your knees down on a pad rather than the bare concrete floor.&nbsp; This is a sign that I am willing to protect my property and keep It from unnecessary discomfort or pain unless it is warranted.&nbsp; Nod if you understand that Master has mercy for his property�

Jacklyn gulped.&nbsp; �His slave.&nbsp; He�s serious.�&nbsp; She reluctantly nodded.

�Good,� Jack responded with a grin.&nbsp; �Now to cement a slave�s status, � hmmm, what is missing?�

Jacklyn didn�t like the look of enjoyment on Jack�s face at this question.&nbsp; �Hmmmf,� she muttered aloud crossly.

�No, that�s not it,� Jack shot back happily.&nbsp; �What is missing?&nbsp; Why, a collar!&nbsp; A slave must have a collar!�

�Collar?� Jacklyn cringed.

Jack took a heavy steel collar from the tote bag he�d set down on a work counter.&nbsp; He held it up for Jacklyn to see.&nbsp; �This indicates my ownership.&nbsp; It indicates slavery for its wearer.&nbsp; And it allow for controlling a slave.�

Jacklyn stared in horror at the heavy steel rings on the collar.&nbsp; �I can imagine what they�re for,� she told herself.&nbsp; �And the collar, � it is heavy and bulky.�&nbsp; With dread, Jacklyn was sure the collar could do more than just control.

�There�s no key,� Jack�s declaration interrupted Jacklyn�s thoughts.&nbsp; Once on, this collar can never be removed.&nbsp; Also,� he grinned as his face came close to Jacklyn�s, �the collar has electronics imbedded inside which measure the distance from the transceiver in the collar to a low-level signal broadcast from my cabin.&nbsp; Get too far away, and the collar initiates a tightening sequence that releases a piano wire from inside the collar which will garrote the wearer.�

Jacklyn stared in horror at the device.

�Also,� Jack continued cheerfully, �if the battery in the collar loses power, than the �kill sequence� is also initiated.&nbsp; Inside the cabin is a special charging station that must be used twice a week.&nbsp; If the collar begins to beep, it has less than 24 hours charge left.&nbsp; Remember, I control the electricity in the cabin.&nbsp; Nod if all this makes sense to my little slavelette.�

Jacklyn shuddered visibly at the horrible device.&nbsp; Reluctantly, and given no choice in the matter, she nodded.&nbsp; She almost collapsed as the device encircled her neck and a loud �snick� indicated the lock had engaged.

�That�s the fun part,� Jack announced.

Warily, Jacklyn watched as Jack drew forth what was clearly a pet leash.&nbsp; She could only kneel and witness the approach of the snap at the end of the leash.&nbsp; As expected, Jack snapped the end of the chain to the cold steel ring dangling from the collar directly under her chin.&nbsp; �Follow,� he commanded.

A gentle tug upward brought Jacklyn to her feet and Jack drew her toward a worktable.&nbsp; When he lifted the leash over the scarred wooden top, Jacklyn had no choice but to move her upper body across the table until her hips came against the edge.&nbsp; A tightening of the leash drew her chin down to the tabletop, leaving her upper body lying across the table.&nbsp; Her wrists were still bound against the snug-fitting waist chain.&nbsp; Helpless and whimpering, Jacklyn closed her eyes as Jack somehow tied off the leash under the tabletop and walked around to her rear.&nbsp; �I can�t see him,� she thought.

She groaned when Jack grasped one of her ankles and attached the cuff still locked on her ankle to the table.&nbsp; Her other ankle was similarly fastened and her helplessness was complete.

�Ho!� she complained through her ring gag.

A loud splat rang out in the room and Jacklyn�s rump exploded in pain.&nbsp; �Howww!� she shrieked.

A moment later, she realized that Jack�s hand was caressing her aching rump.&nbsp; �Hut?&nbsp; Ho!�

�Silly slut isn�t wearing panties!�

�What!� Jacklyn wondered.&nbsp; �No!&nbsp; Where the fuck are my panties?�

She tried to rise up in protest; the leash held her down and her wrists were trapped against her waist.&nbsp; Helpless, she could barely wriggle her butt.

�Nice!� Jack commented to her horror.&nbsp; His hand was now freely roaming around her backside.&nbsp; �Soft and perfect!� he added.

�Ho!� Jacklyn complained again.

Jacklyn felt Jack grab her hair in a tight grip and he yanked back, stretching her chin upward.

�How!� Jacklyn yelled.

�If my little slut slave says no one more time,� Jack warned her, �I�ll use a cane instead of a paddle to administer the fifty penalty strokes already earned.&nbsp; Plus,� his voice increased in menace, �I�ll add more penalty strokes.&nbsp; Be warned, � I fully understand gagspeak.�&nbsp; 

Ho! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= No!
Howww! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= Ow!
Hut? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= What?
Hease! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= Please!
Hokay! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= Okay!
Hepp! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= Help!
Hepp hee! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= Help me!

Jacklyn stilled instantly.&nbsp; Her butt still ached from the single swat it�d received.&nbsp; �How can I survive fifty like that?� she wondered fearfully. 

�Better,� Jack said with obvious satisfaction.&nbsp; �That first swat was to get my slave�s attention, the punishment hasn�t started.�

The questing fingers returned to her butt.&nbsp; This time, Jacklyn held back any protest.&nbsp; �It�s not like I can do anything about it,� she rationalized.&nbsp; In fact, Jack�s soft touch was calming and she squirmed.&nbsp; �It�s kinda hot!� she thought as his fingertips slipped between her butt cheeks and drifted down to her pussy.&nbsp; Unconsciously, her butt spasmed to protect itself and Jack chuckled behind her.

�Does my slut enjoy having her ass and pussy touched?�

Jacklyn flushed in embarrassment.&nbsp; The fingers pulled at her outer labia and roamed around the inside of her sex flaps.&nbsp; Abruptly, the touch was gone and Jacklyn jerked at the loss.

�Time for business first,� Jack said sternly.&nbsp; Jacklyn�s heart sank.&nbsp; �Time for my punishment,� she thought.

�Time to be punished for infractions on the plane,� Jack announced.&nbsp; �Twice my bitch failed to respond to specific questions; at twenty-five for each infraction, that�s fifty total.&nbsp; Normally, I�d make my property count aloud each stroke.&nbsp; However, my little piglet hasn�t proven too smart yet.�&nbsp; His voice hardened in menace, �Slaves learn or they become meat for the wolves!�

Jacklyn lost control of herself and hot piss ran down her leg.&nbsp; Firstly, she was totally humiliated and secondly, she feared for her life when she heard Jack�s exclamation of dismay.

Jack was inwardly pleased at Jacklyn�s response.&nbsp; �She�ll train easily,� he crowed.&nbsp; �This is perfect!&nbsp; Just can�t let Her know how happy I am.�&nbsp; He pulled back his arm and started a slow cadence of strokes against the outside of Jacklyn�s right butt cheek.&nbsp; He calmly counted each stroke.&nbsp; The soft tissue flexed and rippled with the strokes in an almost hypnotic manner.&nbsp; Jack was very pleased with his slave!

Jacklyn was lucky in that each punishing stroke was much softer than the initial one that got her attention for speaking out of turn.&nbsp; Nonetheless, she howled with pain and only heard Jack every few strokes as she stopped shrieking to catch her breath.

After ten strokes, Jack switched to the outside of her other cheek.&nbsp; At twenty, he began to hit the back of her butt.&nbsp; At thirty, he switched to the other backside.

By now, Jacklyn was writhing about and howling as best she could given the ring gag.&nbsp; Jack didn�t slow a bit.

At forty strokes he switched to his bare hand and gave five upward directed strokes to each of her inner thighs.&nbsp; At fifty, Jack paused.&nbsp; He was clearly out of breath.&nbsp; Also, his cock was hard as steel and beginning to ache from arousal.

Jack wandered away for a few minutes to let Jacklyn cool down from the punishment.&nbsp; He attached the trailer to his four-wheeler and got it ready to go.&nbsp; Behind the trailer, he attached a fifteen-foot lead chain with a snap at the end.&nbsp; �She doesn�t know it,� he thought with obvious satisfaction, �but my slave is going to have to walk to the cabin; she isn�t riding with me in the four-wheeler.�

Finished, Jack walked back to the bench and carefully cleaned his hands and then coated his fingertips with KY jelly.&nbsp; Ignoring anything about his slave except for her wondrous ass, Jack speared his three middle fingers together and set his middle finger softly on the crinkly grommet of his bitch�s asshole.

Jacklyn�s butt clenched at the unexpected touch.&nbsp; �Nooo!� she yelled silently.&nbsp; �He�s gonna rape me now!�

In fact, Jack was far from ready to sex his slave for the first time.&nbsp; Instead, he whispered aloud, �I�m afraid my slut can�t take another fifty spankings for its behavior in the hanger today.&nbsp; Instead, I�m trading something else for the pain.&nbsp; Lucky slut should praise its Master for His mercy.�

�Fifty more!� Jacklyn howled to herself.&nbsp; �He was going to hit me fifty more times!�&nbsp; Holy shit!&nbsp; I�d die!�&nbsp; 

Jack set his middle finger into her butt to his first joint.&nbsp; Carefully, he let it roam around the tightest hole on his slavegirl and gently stretched it out.&nbsp; When he added a second finger, Jacklyn whimpered audibly below him.&nbsp; Grinning, Jack added a third finger and he now had three fingers buried one joint deep in Jacklyn�s rump.&nbsp; He pulled out and lubricated his fingertips again, chuckling at Jacklyn�s moan of relief.

This time, he started with the three fingertips and pulled them around in circles; more vigorously stretching her ass now that it had been loosened up a bit.&nbsp; Jack continued until he had all three fingers questing just past his second finger joint.&nbsp; He widened his fingers and grinned at her groan of anguish.&nbsp; Deciding to upset his slavegirl a bit more, he brought his left hand up and under his right in order to begin massaging her pussy.&nbsp; �I�ll wait a little before moving to Her clit,� he thought with satisfaction.&nbsp; �It�s best for Her to feel pleasure and humiliation at the same time.&nbsp; Plus, � I don�t want Her thinking She has any say in Her training.�

Jacklyn was in hell!&nbsp; A virgin, she�d certainly never let anyone play with her ass.&nbsp; �It�s unclean!� she shrieked.&nbsp; The renewed touch on her pussy was added humiliation; especially because, �It feels good,� she moaned.&nbsp; Unconsciously, she rolled her butt to move his touch toward her clit.&nbsp; At his chuckle of enjoyment, she flushed once again in humiliation.&nbsp; �I can�t do anything right!� she wailed.&nbsp; 

Once his slut was beginning to enjoy her pussy stimulation and her ass loosening, Jack reached beside him with his lube-slippery right hand and picked up an already slick butt plug.&nbsp; He knew she was ready; her asshole was still expanded and hadn�t closed.&nbsp; He set the narrowed portion of the fat plug against her butt grommet and pushed smoothly until it set.&nbsp; The howl of anguish by Jacklyn at the larger object raping into her ass brought nothing but deep satisfaction to Jack.&nbsp; She moaned when he removed his hand from her now slick and loose pussy.&nbsp; �My slut isn�t ready to have a nice cumm,� he whispered into her ear.&nbsp; �Be good and I�ll make my slavegirl feel good tonight.�

With that horrifying thought in her head, Jacklyn felt her leg cuffs released from the table and Jack drew her toward the four-wheeler.&nbsp; Each step brought a new cramp from the too-large object jammed into her butt.&nbsp; �What did he do?� she thought.&nbsp; �Is something still in my butt?�&nbsp; After getting to the trailer, she was certain Jack had stuck something into her ass.&nbsp; Plus, the slippery lube now coated her inner thighs and Jacklyn thought it felt nasty.

Jack fired up the four-wheeler, looked backward at his disheveled slavegirl, and slowly inched out of the hanger.&nbsp; As expected, the yank on her collar convinced Jacklyn to stagger after; the lead line brokered no slack.&nbsp; If she fell, the chain would drag her to the house.&nbsp; Humming in happiness, Jack gas the four-wheeler a bit more gas, glanced back to enjoy the awkward staggering steps Jacklyn took as a result of the butt plug, and said, �Yes, � all in all, � a great start.&nbsp; Every step She takes to the cabin that long butt plug will remind her who�s the boss.&nbsp; Plus, I can�t wait to see the expression on Her face when She sees her kennel.�&nbsp;
