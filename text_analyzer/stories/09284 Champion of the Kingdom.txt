Synopsis: Asiara is the Realm's most beautiful, and most feared warrior woman, as deft in the ways of the flesh as she is with her own two blades. But when her Queen sends her on a campaign to conquer the Southern Kingdom, a brief detour sets in motion a chain of erotic encounters that will change Asiara forever.






[b]The Serpent and the Goddess[/b] by Hypnohypno

[b]Chapter 1[/b]

Asiara grinned to hear the clank of her body guards� armor as they marched beside her.&nbsp; They had all insisted on coming to this parlay fully armed in their thick suits of metallic scales and face covering helms, but as they walked through the rapidly approaching dusk, she couldn�t help but think that it far too warm and pleasant an evening to be trapped within such restrictive armor.&nbsp; 

Of course, on one hand, she could hardly blame them � they were about to walk into an enemy camp, enter the tent of their commanding officers, and demand surrender.&nbsp; It made sense to be ready for the worst.

But while Asiara counted on her thick scale mail to get her through the hectic nature of combat on the battle field, in the close quarters of the opposing generals� tent, she knew that dexterity would be the key. And that was exactly what her current outfit afforded her.&nbsp; On her feet she wore a pair of close fitting boots made of supple leather that would allow her to move quickly and gracefully.&nbsp; On her legs she wore a simple, tan pair of skin tight leggings that would do nothing to encumber her actions.&nbsp; And to protect her torso, she wore a simple shirt of lightweight chainmail over a thin woolen tunic.

On her head she wore nothing.&nbsp; This allowed her curly black hair to be free, and her dark, mysterious eyes to be in full view.&nbsp; It also left all who saw her under the spell of her bewitching beauty, as her delicate, pale skin, mischievous grin and alluring, side-long glances had drawn many an unsuspecting man and woman to their rapture � and their destruction.

And this, too, was a benefit of her light attire.&nbsp; Asiara knew that her reputation preceded her; she knew that when she entered her enemies� tent, they would be prepared to see Asiara the Great Warrior.&nbsp; In their minds, she was a ten foot Amazon with muscles that could match the most giant of men.&nbsp; They imagined her to be a walking arsenal of deadly weapons and assumed she�d do everything she could to intimidate them with her military might.

But when she entered that tent in her sparse attire, her appearance would surprise and confuse them, thus giving her the upper hand.&nbsp; For rather than the strapping Amazon that they would expect, what they would actually see would be a woman of average height with a figure that resembles that of a sensuous, slim, and agile dancer rather than that of a powerful warrior woman.&nbsp; Her many legendary victories on the battlefield would continue to inspire fear, but her alluring beauty would utterly disarm them.

And being disarmed in the presence of someone as ruthless and cunning as Asiara was a very dangerous state.

Partheon, Asiara�s top general and confidant had insisted that she protect herself with something more tangible, to wear more armor, but she ignored his behests.&nbsp; She would have her opposition so off balance that they would agree to her terms before they even knew what they were doing.

Besides, even if these negotiations did end in combat, Asiara was sure that she could handle herself.&nbsp; As she thought this, her hand strayed down until it rested softly on Phyxilir, her famous long sword, a weapon whose appearance mirrored that of its owner.

The Queen had given her this sword when she had named Asiara the Captain of the Annol Army, and Defender of the Annol Kingdom.&nbsp; It had been used in the Queen�s service for more than three hundred years, and had become a thing of legend, for its wielder had never been bested in direct combat.&nbsp; Asiara�s own startling success on the battlefield had only added to the sword�s considerable legend.

But like Asiara itself, the sword�s appearance took those who had never seen it by surprise.&nbsp; It wasn�t a giant, two-handed saber, encrusted with jewels and sheathed in a scabbard of solid platinum.&nbsp; It was a simple and elegant weapon, with a mysterious and alluring beauty.&nbsp; Asiara kept it at her side in a slim and elegant scabbard, and it�s strong yet delicate pommel gave little indication of the many deadly battles it had seen.

On her other hip, Asiara wore a short sword whose appearance was very similar to that of Phyxilir.&nbsp; Asiara had named this simple blade Finisher, as it was often the weapon that dealt the final death blow to her opponents while she used Phyxilir to parry their attacks.&nbsp; Finisher had quite a reputation, as well, but that was all due to Asiara�s own prowess, for the short sword had had no other owner.&nbsp; Asiara couldn�t quite remember when she first came across the blade, but she knew that she had had it long before the Queen graced her with Phyxilir.

An expert in two handed combat, these weapons were all that Asiara would need.&nbsp; She scoffed at the bodyguards around her � these five men each had their backs and belts littered with different weapons.&nbsp; Asiara had always preferred the fast and versatile fighting style that her two blades afforded her, and saw no reason to carry any more arms than her two deadly blades.

�There they are.�&nbsp; Nathran, the head of Asiara�s bodyguards broke Asiara out of her reverie as the group rounded a small outcropping of rock and came into view of the Sersiphi army, spread over a wide flat expanse in the middle of the grassy, hilly terrain that surrounded them.

If it could really be called an army, Asiara mused.&nbsp; Scanning the scene in front of her Asiara took stock of what they were really up against.&nbsp; The Queen had mentioned that the Sersiphi army was small, but Asiara was stunned to see just how few soldiers they seemed to have, and how unprepared for war they seemed.

She had known that they were a cultish group, known more for their attempts at sorcery than for their military prowess, but she was shocked by just how weak they all appeared.&nbsp;&nbsp; The warriors that she was able to spot were ill-equipped, and the swords that they carried at their sides seemed foreign to them � as though they had only been in possession of the weapons for a few weeks.&nbsp; But what was most surprising were the many sorcerers that she saw.&nbsp; Unlike the well trained mages in her own army, these were charlatans, praying to their idols for curses and cures that Asiara knew wouldn�t come.&nbsp; This would all be far too easy.

For just a moment she felt a twinge of anger that her Queen had sent her on so far a journey just to stamp out a rebellion that appeared to be so pitiful, but that feeling quickly vanished as her devotion to her Queen flooded through her.&nbsp; She longed to return to her primary mission � an invasion of the Maurial Kingdom to the South, and this diversion would delay their assault, and perhaps reveal their presence, giving the Maurial forces time to organize.&nbsp; But The Queen had commanded that she remove this threat to her kingdom, and that is what Asiara would do.

Striding through the enemy camp, Asiara and her bodyguards reached the central Sersiphi tent and, without ceremony, she pulled open the flap and entered.&nbsp; As her guards fanned out behind her, Asiara glanced around the room, taking in a sight that had become quite familiar to her.&nbsp; On the far end of the tent was a long wooden table, behind which sat the three leaders of the Sersiphi.&nbsp; These three men were dressed in plain brown cloaks, and the man in the middle wore a thin leather band around his head, marking him as the leader of the camp: Brolleon.&nbsp; As Asiara entered, a thin serving girl with auburn braids on either side of her head was pouring each of the men a glass of wine.&nbsp; When she was finished, she moved to the corner of the tent, leaving the men to conduct their business.

The Sersiphi leaders looked up at Asiara and, as she suspected, they gasped to see that the ferocious warrior woman that they had expected did not match what their imaginations had conjured.&nbsp; Asiara walked in her confident but alluring way into the center of the tent, ready for the negotiations to begin.

As she did so, she made a mental note of what she and her guards would be up against if anything should go wrong.&nbsp; Two guards stood on either side of the entrance, and two more had taken up positions on either side of the tent, flanking Asiara.&nbsp; Six men in total, plus the three leaders in front of her.&nbsp; Asiara knew that she and the five guards she had brought with her could make quick work of this group if things came to blows.

But that was the least likely possibility.&nbsp; After all, she had followed the standard practice of instructing her army to attack at daybreak the next morning if she didn�t return.&nbsp; The Sersiphi army wouldn�t stand a chance against such an all-out offensive, so attacking her now would be akin to suicide on their part.

No, the only real question in these negotiations was whether they would surrender immediately, or if they would at least make some effort to save face.

�Leaders of the Sersiphi, I am Asiara, Captain of the Annols.&nbsp; I have come on behalf of my Queen to suppress your rebellion, and to bring you back in line with her decrees.&nbsp; If you swear fealty to her now, we will only require a modest payment in gold as punishment for your insolence.�

Brolleon seemed slightly taken aback upon hearing Asiara�s smoky, sultry voice.&nbsp; Still, he pulled himself together and responded, �Asiara, what you ask for is surrender.&nbsp; That is something we cannot do.�

�Then you will be destroyed.&nbsp; My army will attack first thing tomorrow and, as you know, your army cannot withstand the full might of the Queen�s army.&nbsp; No army can.�

�Do you really think that we started our rebellion only to give in to the first show of might that your little Queen sends our way?&nbsp; We didn�t unite our people in arms for nothing!�

�Of course not.&nbsp; You suspected that the Queen would respond with an army befitting the size of the threat � in other words, a small one.&nbsp; But that is not what you are facing.&nbsp; If you choose war, the battle will be short and decisive.&nbsp; You know this as well as I do.&nbsp; Your people are counting on you to do the wise thing.�

As she said this, Asiara once again felt a twinge of indignation as the overwhelming odds in her favor made all of this seem beneath her.&nbsp; Why had her Queen sent her here?&nbsp; The Maurials to the South would prove a much greater challenge, and Asiara would have preferred to save her army�s strength for that invasion.&nbsp; Whatever the reason, though, it was not her place to question.&nbsp; She would simply get this over with quickly and then return to the capitol.

Unfortunately, Bolleon did not seem to want to cooperate.&nbsp; �You know as well as anyone, Asiara, that a strong leader is far more important than a large and well-trained army.&nbsp; Your own skills in this regard are quite renowned.�

�That is all the more reason for you to surrender now, while you have the chance.�&nbsp; Even as she said this, Asiara felt the familiar prickling on the back of her neck that told her that there was danger in the air.&nbsp; She could hear her body guards subtly shifting their weight as they, too, felt this threat beginning to grow.

�Indeed, with you at the head of the army, we would stand no chance.&nbsp; But that is why we have made arrangements to ensure that you will not be at the head of the army.�

�If you intend to try to kill me while I am in your camp, it will only make matters worse for you.&nbsp; Even without me, my army will make short work of your pitiful band.&nbsp; And if any harm comes to me, I can assure you, there will be no surrender, only slaughter.�&nbsp; Asiara was confident in the words she had just spoken, but she was also confident that it wouldn�t come to that.&nbsp; She let her hands move subtly towards the hilts of her swords as the discussion continued.

�Ah, but by your own admission, a great leader can make quite the difference.&nbsp; And my �pitiful band� will soon have the greatest leader of all.�

�Hah,� Asiara scoffed, �and who is that leader?&nbsp; You?�

�No, Asiara.&nbsp; That leader is you!�

Asiara heard the sound of metal scraping against metal as the Sersiphi guards drew their swords.

Negotiations were clearly over, and Asiara was ready for action.&nbsp; With a single motion, she leapt onto the table, drawing both of her blades at the same time.&nbsp; She landed on the table with an emphatic �thunk,� and swung her blades in unison, cutting Bolleon down in a pair of swipes that cut his head cleanly off of his body.

Not hesitating to admire her handiwork, she kicked with her right leg, catching the man who had sat next to Bolleon squarely in the face.&nbsp; She felt his nose and cheek collapse under the force of her boot, and he fell backwards, out of his chair.&nbsp; She didn�t know if he was dead or not, but he would no longer be a factor in this fight.

The man on Bolleon�s other side had drawn a dagger and now attacked Asiara from her left, but Phyxilir was already in position to intercept his thrust.&nbsp; Jamming the longsword hard into the air, she raised her assailant�s own arm straight above him, leaving his torso completely exposed to Finisher, which earned its name as the short sword plunged into the man�s heart.

Asiara�s next move was borne of instinct � an instinct that had served her well over the years.&nbsp; She sprung backwards, off of the table just as one of the Sersiphi guards charged her from behind.&nbsp; Flipping in the air, she landed gracefully behind the warrior, then plunged Finisher into his back before he had time to react.&nbsp; The sword drove through the man�s leather armor and severed his spine.

Unfortunately, the blade was caught in the man�s ribs, so Asiara had to let it go for the time being.&nbsp; She wasn�t too concerned, though � spinning around so that she could take stock of the combat that had been happening behind her, she was certain that she would see the final stages of a lop-sided skirmish as her guards finished off the pathetic Sersiphi fighters.

What Asiara actually saw was shocking to her.&nbsp; Three Sersiphi guards lay dead on the ground, but the others were still standing, watching as Asiara�s guards slowly slumped to the ground.&nbsp; Asiara�s mind raced to find an explanation for what had happened, even as she assumed her battle stance, ready to take on the Sersiphi herself.

A sharp pain in her neck alerted her to her one crucial mistake.&nbsp; Spinning around once again, her free hand went to the small dart in her neck at the same time that her eyes fell upon her attacker.&nbsp; Standing in the corner of the tent, the serving girl still stood, forgotten.&nbsp; Only now, the young woman held a small blow-gun in her hands, and a sly, confident look on her face.

Asiara tried to resist the poison that was spreading through her body, but the room had already begun to spin, and her knees felt weak.&nbsp; Phyxilir slipped from her grasp as she fell onto the table in front of her.&nbsp; Her knees buckled, and she gripped the wooden surface before her, trying to keep herself up-right.&nbsp; But it was no use.&nbsp; As she crumpled to the side, onto the packed earth floor, she felt all of her strength ebbing from her limbs.&nbsp; She looked up at the ceiling of the tent, which now seemed to be spiraling endlessly above her, and then all was dark�

[b]Chapter 2[/b]

The next thing that Asiara was aware of was a scent.&nbsp; She couldn�t place it, but it put her in mind of� she wasn�t sure what, but whatever it was, it seemed to be everywhere, filling her nostrils, and it was� affecting her, somehow.

There was also something cold and hard beneath her � as though she were lying on stone.&nbsp; And there were voices � soft and chanting � nearby, but she couldn�t make out what any of them were saying.

When Asiara pulled her eyes open, she found that she was no longer in the tent.&nbsp; She only had the strength to keep her eyes open for a moment, but in that moment she was able to recognize the stars above her, and light from the green moon filled her eyes.

As her eyes fell closed once again, she forced her mind to think.&nbsp; She was cold.&nbsp; This was to be expected since she was outside in the night air, but still, she shouldn�t be quite this cold.&nbsp; Then she realized: she was naked!

This realization gave her enough strength to force her eyes open once again.&nbsp; Holding them open a bit longer this time, she took in a few more details of her surroundings.&nbsp; She was lying on some kind of stone platform, and was surrounded by people � the Sersiphi, she realized.&nbsp; A few of them were immediately next to the platform that held her; looking down at her and holding small braziers that were emitting wisps of smoke.&nbsp; Asiara realized that this was the source of the scent that she had detected as she awoke.

Behind this small group, a large group � probably all of the other Sersiphi, judging by the size of the crowd, had gathered around her, and were slowly, suggestively dancing as they chanted words that Asiara could not understand.

Asiara�s strength gave out again, and she allowed her eyes to flutter closed once more.&nbsp; She was in danger, that much was clear.&nbsp; The platform that she was lying on must be some sort of altar, she realized, and she was to be a sacrifice.&nbsp; It was night, so her armies wouldn�t come to massacre these pathetic people for several more hours.&nbsp; If she was going to escape, she�d have to accomplish it herself.

But her body refused to respond to her commands.&nbsp; She tried to move her legs, but could only manage to shift them slightly.&nbsp; She certainly didn�t have the strength to stand, let alone fight.&nbsp; The efforts of trying move, as well as the energy that she�d spent taking all this in left her drained, and she felt herself slipping into unconsciousness once more�

�No!� she thought.&nbsp; �I have to resist this.&nbsp; I have to escape.�&nbsp; She struggled to open her eyes again.&nbsp; This time, when she did so, she saw a woman standing at the head of the altar, leaning over her � Asiara�s clouded mind tried to remember where she�d seen this woman before.&nbsp; Vague memories of the tent, of a serving girl, of a dart, all flitted through her mind.&nbsp; Then, the beautiful young woman lowered her hands to either side of Asiara�s head, stroking her temples and cheeks softly.

Asiara�s eyes fluttered shut once more at this touch, and she let out a slight gasp.&nbsp; Something about this woman�s touch was electric, and Asiara was already� aroused � that was it; that was what that scent reminded her of.&nbsp; The smell was turning her on, and this woman�s seductive touch was increasing the effect.&nbsp; She forced her eyes open again, and found herself staring directly into the beautiful face of the woman, who was smiling down at her.

�Relax, my dear.&nbsp; We are going to make you feel so good.&nbsp; And we are going to fill you with power.�

With that, the woman withdrew her hands, causing Asiara to involuntarily let out a slight, whiny moan at losing the contact.&nbsp; Yes, there was no denying it, Asiara was aroused.&nbsp; She could feel the wetness in her sex and her nipples � already quite hard from the cold air � were now throbbing slightly in their need for attention.

Asiara had just cracked her eyes open again when two pairs of hands slipped beneath her back and lifted her torso into a sitting position and causing her eyes to roll back into her head as her neck was too weak to support her.&nbsp; Another pair of hands offered a bowl to her lips, and she felt a mysterious, fiery liquid being poured into her mouth.&nbsp; Some of it spilled out of her lips, the rivulets teasing her sensitive skin, but most of it passed down her throat, burning slightly as it went.

As the liquid slid into her, Asiara was lowered back down to the altar.&nbsp; The burning didn�t stop when it reached her stomach, but it wasn�t an unpleasant burning.&nbsp; It felt more like a tingly warmth that quickly began to spread from her stomach into other parts of her body.&nbsp; Soon her whole body was alive with a sensation of heat, and of passion.&nbsp; Asiara let out a long moan as the sensations bombarding her body continued to increase her arousal.

She also found that whatever she had drunk was bringing some life back to her drugged, limp body.&nbsp; She still doubted that she had the power to stand, but the heaviness had waned slightly.&nbsp; She was able to seductively rub her thighs together, trying to get some friction on the sensitive area between her legs, and her arms were slowly, lethargically trying to caress her own skin.

Then, the beautiful young woman�s hands returned, holding her head in place, which she suddenly realized had been moving from side to side as she tried to writhe on the altar.&nbsp; The woman leaned closer and closer to Asiara, bringing her mouth down slowly towards Asiara�s own.&nbsp; Eventually, she was so close that Asiara could feel the breath from the woman�s nose on her chin, and her lips were mere centimeters away.&nbsp; The woman�s lips parted, and her mouth descended still more.

But it wasn�t a kiss that Asiara felt � the woman was flicking her tongue over Asiara�s lips, letting it flutter over her skin, and then retreat back into her mouth.&nbsp; It was an unusual motion, but one that seemed familiar to Asiara�s drug and arousal soaked mind.&nbsp; The woman repeated the action, and Asiara mustered what strength she had to try to raise her head slightly while opening her own lips, searching for a real kiss.&nbsp; But the woman pulled away slightly, and her grip on Asiara�s head prevented her from moving enough to increase the contact between their mouths.

The young woman whispered to Asiara again.&nbsp; �Relax, let us guide you.&nbsp; We will give you power unlike anything you�ve ever know.&nbsp; Our Goddess has chosen you to be her vessel.&nbsp; She will fill you with ecstasy.&nbsp; Let us guide her to you.�

Asiara moaned, both in arousal and frustration as she felt the woman repeat the procedure from before.&nbsp; This time, though, a new wave of sensations flooded Asiara�s mind as she felt several more tongues descend upon her body, claiming other parts of her with this same tantalizing yet teasing touch � flicking over her nipples, along her sides, on her forearms, on the insides of her thighs, on her calves, and on her toes.&nbsp; She let out a long and lustful moan as the many touches increased the sensitivity of her skin, as well as the wetness within her sex.&nbsp; Even in the cold air, Asiara had begun to sweat slightly, and her body was writhing as much as her lethargy would allow as these countless tongues drove her wild with erotic need.&nbsp; All the while, the scent filled her nostrils and the warmth from the draught continued to drive her still higher in her arousal.

Asiara no longer thought of escape, she thought only of release.

�I think she�s ready,� the young woman said, standing straight.&nbsp; She then disappeared from Asiara�s line of sight.&nbsp; The helplessly aroused woman closed her eyes and let her head thrash from side to side as her need increased.&nbsp; Still, these fluttering, teasing tongues were doing nothing that would ever bring her to orgasm � they were only filling her with lust and desire.

Opening her eyes, she saw that the young auburn-haired woman had reappeared, but this time at the foot of the altar.&nbsp; Over the collection of heads, both male and female, that were hovering around her body, driving her wild with their tongues, Asiara could see the woman quite clearly.&nbsp; She could also see that the woman held something, and immediately, she realized why these flickering tongues had seemed oddly familiar.&nbsp; In the woman�s arms was a large, powerful snake, it�s muscles rippling beneath its scales while it�s tongue continually flickered in and out of it its mouth.&nbsp; Asiara suddenly felt a new sensation join the continually growing need inside of her: she felt fear.

The woman stepped forward and placed the snake on the altar between Asiara�s feet.&nbsp; �Come, Dathaka, enter this vessel.&nbsp; Please, great Goddess, come to us in our time of need.�

The snake slid slowly between Asiara�s quivering thighs, its head brushing against her left leg, the tongue dancing across her skin, causing her to gasp even as the sense of impending doom gripped her.&nbsp; She felt hands pulling the top half of her body up away from the stone again, and the snake, now very close to her sex, veered away and slid over her hip.&nbsp; It slowly slid behind her, moving along her lower back with its head as the other portions of its body continued to slide along her thigh and hips, sending erotic shivers through her inflamed skin.

When the snake made its way completely around her, and began to now inch its head across her stomach, Asiara began to feel a sense of panic mix with the arousal coursing through her.&nbsp; She knew where this was headed, and she tried to struggle, but the hands lifting her torso off of the altar were also holding her tightly, and in her still weakened state there was nothing she could do to escape.

Her fears were confirmed when the snake made its slow, sensual, yet deadly way around her body again, coiling across her stomach and looping around her back again.&nbsp; By now, a large portion of the snake�s body was sliding against Asiara�s yearning, sexually charged skin, and she found herself moaning uncontrollably even as she tried in vain to escape the grip of her captors.&nbsp; As the snake made its way around her once more, this time slithering slowly between her breasts before coiling around the back of her neck, Asiara started doing everything in her power to clear her mind and try to think of a way out of this.

This was a difficult proposition, though.&nbsp; Her body was betraying her with its need for release � her skin was on fire with need, and her sex was dripping wet.&nbsp; Her nipples were jutting out, seeming to beg for the snake�s attention; for that probing, teasing tongue.&nbsp; Mixed with these overwhelming feelings was an intense fear as well, and this, like the arousal, was clouding her mind, making it nearly impossible for her to consider her options rationally.

Of course, the few rational thoughts that she could manage were of little use, as her predicament was beginning to look rather hopeless.&nbsp; The snake had now completely wound itself around her.&nbsp; Starting at her left thigh, it had wrapped its deadly body around her stomach, across her chest, resting between her breasts, and now had moved around the back of her neck until its head was next to her right ear.&nbsp; Its tongue stroked her cheek with its flittering, maddening, and erotic touch, and she could hear its hiss in her ear.&nbsp; 

Asiara felt her body being lowered back to the altar.&nbsp; Suddenly, the whispered sounds of chanting that had been humming in the background became louder and, as they did so, Asiara could feel every muscle in the snake�s body come to life.&nbsp; But it wasn�t moving this time, it was squeezing, pressing itself into her more firmly, more insistently, and, to Asiara�s sex crazed mind, more erotically.&nbsp; With her last possible rational thought, she remembered something she had learned years ago about these constrictors: they didn�t so much crush the air out of their victims as they waited for their victim to exhale.&nbsp; Then, they would tighten, making it harder to draw air back in.&nbsp; Mustering all of the strength that she had left, she strained against the snake, determined to keep her ribcage open and her stomach and lungs as full as possible.

But her need was making this so incredibly difficult.&nbsp; She stifled the moans that had been flowing freely from her lips and resisted the gasps that had escaped her throat so many times in the last several minutes.&nbsp; She had to hold on.&nbsp; She didn�t know what time it was, but perhaps the dawn would arrive soon.&nbsp; Perhaps her army would be here to kill these cultish fools, and to pry this snake off of her.&nbsp; Perhaps she would be free to give herself the release that she craved so desperately.

This thought brought her mind back to the pent up frustrations in her sex, and she felt a moan slip out of her throat.&nbsp; The snake tightened its grip and hissed in her ear.&nbsp; This time, though, the hiss seemed to penetrate her mind, to take form, to speak to her.

*Let go, Asiara.&nbsp; I only want to bring you two things that you�ve always desired: pleasure and power.&nbsp; I can make you feel so good.&nbsp; I can ease the frustration that you�re feeling.&nbsp; I can erase the fear.&nbsp; Let me take you, and you will never have need to fear again.*

Asiara shook her head, not wanting the seductive voice to influence her.&nbsp; Still, the words that she heard eroded her resistance slightly, and she felt the snake�s muscles closing around her just a bit more.&nbsp; She could still breathe, but her breath was now labored, and not just because of the fiery lust that was consuming her.&nbsp; She was giving in.&nbsp; But, she was the Captain of the Annol.&nbsp; She had to fight!

As the chanting around her became still louder, Asiara suddenly felt something � a presence.&nbsp; She heard the auburn haired woman exclaim, �Feel her, my people, Dathaka is amongst us.&nbsp; She believes our sacrifice is worthy.&nbsp; She has come to lead us to victory.�&nbsp; And it was true, Asiara could feel the Goddess around her, floating over her body, around it, wrapped around her just like the snake.&nbsp; Perhaps her spirit was in the snake, or perhaps the snake was merely her tool.&nbsp; Either way, Asiara now felt that her struggle was not only to keep her breath, but to keep her soul, and this Goddess was intent upon ripping her soul from her lustful, yearning body.

*You will give in eventually, Asiara.&nbsp; I know you are strong, that is why I have chosen you as my vessel.&nbsp; But you are smart, too.&nbsp; You know you cannot win.&nbsp; So why not relax?&nbsp; Why not enjoy this?*

No!&nbsp; Asiara knew that these words were probably true, but she couldn�t let herself give in.&nbsp; This was a contest of wills, and she was determined to win.&nbsp; But then, a new sensation drove some of her resistance out of her.&nbsp; The auburn-haired woman had leaned down, and was now pleasuring her sex with those same tantalizing snake-kisses that she had used on Asiara�s lips earlier.&nbsp; As soft and teasing as these motions were, to Asiara�s frustrated, sex crazed mind they were like a pleasure filled oasis in a desert of burning erotic need.&nbsp; She lost control and let out a deep and yearning moan.

And as she did so, the snake constricted, squeezing more of the life out of her.

*That�s it, my prize.&nbsp; Feel yourself giving in.&nbsp; It makes you feel so good.&nbsp; You want so badly to let go, to feel that release.&nbsp; Let me release you.&nbsp; Let me free you.&nbsp; Let your climax purge your heavy soul and purify your body.*

Yes, Asiara thought, that would feel wonderful.&nbsp; To finally achieve release; to allow her orgasm to burst around that flickering yet wonderfully insistent tongue would be a rapture that she had never, in all of her conquests, both sexual and military, felt before.

Or had she?&nbsp; Her Queen popped into her mind at that moment.&nbsp; Perhaps it was her lack of air, or her arousal fogged brain, but she couldn�t remember what the Queen looked like, or even what she had said to her exactly, but she knew that she had to protect the kingdom.&nbsp; She had to resist!

She rolled slightly to the side, trying to pull her sex away from the woman�s tongue.&nbsp; Meanwhile, her hands came to rest against the snake, trying desperately to pull the deadly animal away from her oxygen deprived body.&nbsp; She was furiously gulping air, refusing to allow herself to succumb to the assault upon her sex, her body, her mind, and her soul.

*Your resistance is so erotic, so intoxicating.&nbsp; The more you struggle the more intense your final release will be.&nbsp; And, with the intensity of your release, the depth of my power over you will be more intense as well.&nbsp; Fight it, Asiara, let the feelings race through you, claiming you, making you more and more mine!*

Asiara�s ability to reason was lost to her now, so she struggled to comprehend what she had just heard.&nbsp; The voice was deeper in her mind now, and she could feel the Goddess�s soul inhabiting her body, trying to push her out.&nbsp; But still, she fought, fighting back the climax that she had been so desperately trying to achieve only moments ago.&nbsp; She was still able to breathe, though just barely, and she knew that if she gave in, if she achieved orgasm, the snake would be able to finish its task.

But all the while, the tongue continued to work its magic.&nbsp; And Asiara was finding that the wooziness resulting from her lack of air was only making her arousal grow still more intense.&nbsp; As much as the weight of the snake would allow, her body was writhing and heaving as sexual need claimed her every nerve, her every muscle � it infused the very blood coursing through her body, and ignited what little air she drew into her lungs.

Was the voice right?&nbsp; Was resisting only making her eventual, inevitable failure more complete?&nbsp; Should she just let it happen?

*That�s it, Asiara.&nbsp; You know that this is going to happen.&nbsp; I am beginning to take control of you now, and that will only continue.*

Asiara felt as if her mind were now being squeezed even more strongly than her body was.&nbsp; And the tongue between her thighs was flooding her entire being with pleasure and desire so intense that she could resist no more.&nbsp; Following one last attempt at struggle, one last attempt to breathe, one last attempt to escape the dastardly tongue, Asiara felt her release begin to well up within her womb.&nbsp; Now past the point of no return, she let out a deep and soul shattering moan, and felt the snake finish its task, squeezing the breath out of her.&nbsp; The presence of the Goddess became more insistent, too, pushing into her mind, trying to drive her out of her body.

*Feel me claim you!&nbsp; That�s it, I will honor my promise!&nbsp; Feel the pleasure take you!&nbsp; Feel me inside you!&nbsp; I am now you, and you are nothing more than pleasure!*

Asiara�s orgasm crashed upon her.&nbsp; She lost all ability to fight the Goddess, the lack of air combined with the climax that now washed over her to create a sensation that was unlike anything she had ever felt.&nbsp; All that she could think of, all that she could be aware of, all that she could be, was this pleasure, this quaking, soul destroying ecstasy of sexual release.&nbsp; She bucked upon the altar, flinging her head back and arching her back, suddenly unable to moan as she no longer had the necessary breath.&nbsp; Instead, she bucked in silent rapture, and felt, in addition to the pleasure coursing through her, a new sensation of power, of strength and ability that went beyond the limitations of her muscles.&nbsp; And with this came a new capacity for pleasure that was quickly filled as her climax endured, with no sign of waning.&nbsp; The feeling was continuous, consuming her mind and soul in a fire of lust that was more than her mortal essence could endure.&nbsp; As though washed away on a torrent of pleasure, Asiara�s consciousness left her.&nbsp; She was empty, consumed, and all was suddenly dark�

[b]The Savior[/b] by Hypnohypno

[b]Chapter 3[/b]

Asiara slowly felt awareness returning, although it was a state of mind that she was not accustomed to.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t really feel as though she had regained consciousness &#8211; things were still blurry, and she struggled to put together complete thoughts.&nbsp; She still had a vague awareness of her body, she could still feel her nakedness; she could still the feel the snake, wrapped around her, wringing her life out of her; she was still unable to breath; and she was still deeply, intensely, overwhelmingly aroused.&nbsp; In much the same way that the snake robbed her of her ability to draw in air, the cascade of sexual energy pouring over her robbed her of her ability to think clearly.

But she didn&#8217;t need to think, anyway; she could simply revel in this never-ending lust, since her body was no longer hers to control.&nbsp; Through her sustained sense of erotic need, she was aware that she was moving, that her own legs were carrying her naked body, still bearing the snake, across a grassy field.&nbsp; And her ears told her that a small army was walking behind her.&nbsp; Then, she stopped.&nbsp; Before her, perhaps three hundred yards away, was another army &#8211; a large army, full of powerful, iron-clad warriors.&nbsp; In its midst stood several magi, their robes indicating the power that they held.

Asiara&#8217;s head moved, under a power that was beyond her control, to survey the scene.&nbsp; Two large outcroppings of rock were to either side of her, and from her vantage point she could make out the Sersiphi forces.&nbsp; A third of them were behind her, and a third on either side &#8211; one beyond the outcropping to her left and one beyond the outcropping to her right.&nbsp; On each outcropping stood a very small band of archers and warriors, not enough to be of any significance in a battle of this size.&nbsp; The factions to her left and right were clearly going to attempt a flanking maneuver while the middle faction, the one that she was leading, would bear the brunt of the opposing army&#8217;s attack.&nbsp; 

Only it wasn&#8217;t the opposing army &#8211; it was the Annols; it was her own army.&nbsp; If only she could regain control of her body, she could rejoin them.

But every time she attempted to summon up the willpower to fight the presence in her mind that was controlling her, a ripple of pleasure would race through her, eradicating any thoughts of resistance.&nbsp; It was hopeless, she was merely a passive observer, bathing in sexual need, as the Goddess Dathaka took her mortal form into battle.

But even in her passive state, Asiara was still capable of examining the battle plan &#8211; doing so was, after all, practically second nature to her and required very little focus.&nbsp; The flanking maneuver would be obvious to the other army, but it was the best possible strategy given how outnumbered the Sersiphi forces were.&nbsp; There were two critical flaws in the plan, though.&nbsp; First, the opposing army &#8211; Asiara&#8217;s army she reminded herself again &#8211; was so large that it could easily split into thirds and neutralize the flanking advantage.&nbsp; Second, the Sersiphi&#8217;s middle group wasn&#8217;t strong enough to withstand the might of the opposing army&#8217;s main force for very long.&nbsp; Once this faction was defeated, the flanking forces would be vulnerable and helpless.

And yet, Asiara felt a strong sense of confidence in the spirit lurking within her, controlling her mind.&nbsp; Dathaka believed she could win this battle, and her bravado spread throughout her body &#8211; the body she shared with Asiara &#8211; and increased the wetness in her sex.&nbsp; Asiara was fighting to remind herself of which side she was on, but somehow it just felt so good to give in to Dathaka&#8217;s control, to let herself revel in the Goddess&#8217;s power.

And as she felt herself yielding, she suddenly gained a small glimpse into what the Goddess was planning.&nbsp; As their minds touched, thrilling Asiara with an erotic pulse of soul-altering lust, Asiara realized an aspect of the plan she had missed before.&nbsp; From her vantage point, it was clear that the small groups on the outcroppings of rock were a meager band of ill-equipped soldiers.&nbsp; But from where the enemy &#8211; no, Asiara reminded herself, it was her own army &#8211; stood, it would be impossible to tell how many warriors the Sersiphi held in reserve there.&nbsp; They would be wary of fully confronting the flanking forces for fear that doing so would leave them open to another flanking maneuver from what might be another sizeable force.&nbsp; Dathaka had arranged the field of battle so that it would look like she was coaxing them into a trap, and the Annol&#8217;s fear of that illusionary trap would prevent them from actually pressing their very real advantage.

But that still left the other flaw in the plan.&nbsp; There was no way that the small army standing behind Asiara would be able to withstand the full might of the other army&#8217;s strongest warriors.&nbsp; That battle would be a slaughter and, once it was over, the Sersiphi would fall.

As if punctuating this thought, Asiara heard horns coming from the opposing army.&nbsp; And then, the steady sound of marching.&nbsp; The Annol army &#8211; her army &#8211; was on the move.

Bending to Dathaka&#8217;s will, Asiara raised her arm above her head &#8211; for the first time, she was aware that she was holding her swords, Phyxilir and Finisher, in her hands, and this knowledge made her feel more powerful, more commanding, and more aroused.&nbsp; If she could control her breath, she would have let out a long and wailing moan.

 With Phyxiler in the air, she signaled to the forces behind her to wait.&nbsp; And as she waited, she watched as the large army came closer.

As it drew near, it was clear that the Sersiphi were doomed.&nbsp; The generals of the enemy (her generals, she fought to remind herself) clearly understood the importance of neutralizing this central force quickly.&nbsp; Spread amongst the regimens of some of their best warriors were three powerful magi.&nbsp; Asiara recognized them, Islin, Calean, and Mertol.&nbsp; Islin was an ancient magi, immensely powerful and with the experience of many battles behind him.&nbsp; Mertol was slightly younger, but had a reputation for being ruthless in battle.&nbsp; Calean was quite young &#8211; a magi of prodigious abilities, he had risen astonishingly quickly through the ranks.&nbsp; Against these three, the Sersiphi stood little chance.&nbsp; Asiara scanned the battle field for Partheon, but he was nowhere to be found.&nbsp; He was probably directing everything from behind the lines, as a sensible leader would.&nbsp; Not everyone enjoyed the fray as much as she did.

As the army grew very near, Asiara felt the familiar flush of adrenaline flood her body.&nbsp; This time, though, that adrenaline was accompanied by a hot, intense sexual need &#8211; a wave of desire so powerful that only a Goddess could withstand it without her knees buckling.&nbsp; Asiara&#8217;s strategic, military brain was annihilated by that sudden burst of desire.&nbsp; In just a few moments, Dathaka had reduced her mind to a quivering, lust starved observer.&nbsp; The battle was about to begin, and Asiara could only watch as her own body, still wrapped in the tense, life-stealing embrace of the snake, launched into action.

As Asiara came into contact with the first ranks, she could see the spearmen at the head of the column stare at her with wild, confused eyes.&nbsp; Whether it was because they were seeing their own leader, or because she was naked except for a snake, or both, was beyond Asiara&#8217;s lust filled comprehension, but soon she couldn&#8217;t think of them at all.&nbsp; As her sword cut the throat of the nearest soldier with a single precise slash, Asiara felt her erotic agony grow in intensity.&nbsp; When another spearman fell, she grew still more enraptured by her need for release.&nbsp; 

She had no control over her lust filled body as Dathaka used her physical form to cut through the soldiers with a devastating and swift ease &#8211; instead, she could only revel in the carnage as each death drove her closer and closer to a new sexual peak that she had never yet experienced.&nbsp; In addition to Dathaka&#8217;s power giving her body a capacity for deadly skill with her swords that even she, the most feared warrior in the land, could never hope to match on her own, the Goddess&#8217;s presence within her also opened her body to new levels of erotic rapture.&nbsp; She had already reached a level of arousal that would normally have been sufficient to push her over the orgasmic edge whether she was willing to let go or not, but now her body was able to go higher, to become even more saturated with fiery, mind-altering need.

And so she continued to cut through the army before her in a state of uncontrolled and overwhelming desire.&nbsp; Each new death seemed to cause an explosion in her sex and Asiara could do nothing but succumb to Dathaka&#8217;s power over her body as her mind was reduced to a quivering, thoughtless vessel of pleasure again and again and again.&nbsp; For the death toll was astounding.&nbsp; Asiara&#8217;s body, under Dathaka&#8217;s control, was a killing machine, moving with blinding speed and frightening effectiveness, she was cutting a wide gouge straight down the middle of the army&#8217;s &#8211; her army&#8217;s &#8211; strongest column of warriors.&nbsp; The soldiers, quickly forgetting that she was formerly their leader, tried in vain to attack her, but with Dathaka&#8217;s power controlling her limbs, she easily danced through their weapons while slicing through their armor, running them through on her swords, cutting their throats, or dismembering them with an ease that was, for Asiara, as shocking as it was erotic.

In the dim remnants of her awareness, she was aware of Dathaka&#8217;s response to her other critique of the Sersiphi&#8217;s battle plan &#8211; the middle group of warriors would be able to survive much longer, because leading them was a one-woman harbinger of annihilation, and she was easily turning the tide of this battle.&nbsp; Asiara felt her body spiraling further and further into the oblivion of a state of arousal without release that her mind could no longer comprehend as her fighting prowess brought about the demise of her own army.

But then, just as she was about to reach the point that even her Goddess-inhabited body could no longer resist orgasm, a new sensation cleared her mind ever so slightly.&nbsp; An intense heat &#8211; not one of arousal, but of actual fire, descended upon her, burning her skin and sending a pain racing through her that gave her mind a new level of focus.&nbsp; As her vision cleared from the flames that had engulfed her, she looked forward to see Islin, the ancient magi.

The charred earth around Asiara was evidence of the fireball that he had just hurled at her, but Asiara saw that no part of her showed even the slightest evidence of his magical assault.&nbsp; The ancient spell caster began to chant again, and this time a torrent of lightening coursed through Asiara&#8217;s body, once again filling her with agony so intense that she wanted to scream.&nbsp; But she was not in control of her body, and Dathaka seemed unaffected by the intense electricity dancing through her.

When the electric maelstrom was finished, Asiara saw Islin looking at her in astonishment.&nbsp; He was panting with the effort of these two spells, and, for the first time since she had known him, Asiara something new in his eyes: fear.&nbsp; And that fear, even more so than the electricity that had just raced through her, penetrated Asiara&#8217;s body, recharging her arousal, and taking it still higher than it had previously been.&nbsp; Asiara felt her own arm raise Phyxilir above her head and then bring it down in a sweeping arc that cut through the magical protections that Islin had put around himself.&nbsp; The sword swept effortlessly through the air and, at the height of its arc, passed through the skin of one of the realm&#8217;s most powerful magi, beheading him and bringing the mighty sorcerer to his end.

As his head toppled from his body, the intensity of Asiara&#8217;s need burst upon her as her body achieved climax.&nbsp; Her mind failed to comprehend the immensity of the sensation that wracked her physical form, and she lost all ability to know the world around her as her only focus, the only thing that mattered or even existed to her, was soul filling, rapturous pleasure.&nbsp; She could feel her sex squirting her secretions on the blood stained battle fields and her skin burning with an inner heat more dangerous and intense than the fires that had encompassed her moments before.&nbsp; The intensity of her orgasm was so strong that Asiara seemed to be swept away by it, even departing the physical body that the Goddess was making such effective and erotic use of.&nbsp; Asiara, lacking any control of her body, was able to focus every part of her mind on the pleasure she was feeling, and she simply became that pleasure &#8211; there was nothing else for her to think about, nothing else to know of, nothing else to be.

How long she remained in this state she had no idea, but eventually, the level of her arousal diminished enough for her to realize that her climax had passed.&nbsp; It had not, however, dampened her sexual need, nor had it prevented Dathaka from continuing to make use of her sweat covered body.&nbsp; As Asiara&#8217;s awareness of things other than climax slowly, shakily returned, she saw that in the time that she had been lost in her erotic rapture, Dathaka had continued to cut her way through the enemy forces, and now she had reached a second mage: Mertol.

Mertol wasted no time.&nbsp; He began chanting and, within moments, skeletons seemed to rip themselves out of the ground around Asiara&#8217;s possessed body.&nbsp; Dathaka set her body in motion and cut these down in moments.&nbsp; They had accomplished their real task, though, which was to slow her down just enough for Mertol to cast a more powerful spell &#8211; one that brought forth several powerful demons to do his bidding.

Unfortunately for him, he didn&#8217;t account for a key flaw in his plan.&nbsp; Though these demons were bound to him and had to do his bidding, they quickly recognized that the body before them, though human, housed a deity that they were not at liberty to attack.&nbsp; They formed a defensive perimeter around Mertol, but made no aggressive motions.&nbsp; The concentration required for Mertol maintain to control of the demons, though, was substantial, so he was now stuck motionless, fighting to control the very charges that he had conjured in the hopes that they would aid him.&nbsp; In this focused state, he never saw the short sword that flew through the air and imbedded itself in his chest &#8211; sending the demons instantly back to their home plane of existence, and forcing his soul to find another one.

Asiara saw the sword that she threw as it sped through the air, passing between the protective demons, but she never saw Mertol&#8217;s lifeless body reach the ground.&nbsp; Once again, the death of so powerful a foe brought her body and mind to climax, and all she was aware of were stars as the pleasure cascaded over her.&nbsp; She lost all awareness of what was happening around her as sexual release claimed her once again, trapping her mind in bondage as tight as the snake wrapped around her body.&nbsp; She felt as if she were spinning, and in every direction was more stimulation; more sensation driving her to a sensual frenzy.

After several agonizingly ecstatic moments, she finally regained a modicum of ability to think about more than just her overwhelming pleasure.&nbsp; Her body still pulsed with a need greater than any she had felt prior to becoming Dathaka&#8217;s puppet, but she was able to make some sense of the world around her again.

As she did so, she quickly realized that Dathaka had wasted no time: she had made her way straight to Calean, the final magi, and the last hope of the opposing army to drive back the Sersiphi.&nbsp; Asiara knew that this would most likely be the end of the Annol forces that she had led these past few months.&nbsp; If Mertol and Islin couldn&#8217;t withstand Dathaka&#8217;s onslaught, then Calean stood little chance.&nbsp; After all, he was far younger and less experienced than the other magi.

As Asiara saw her body close in on him, she could see that he was finishing casting a spell.&nbsp; But nothing happened.&nbsp; As Dathaka closed the final meters between them, both of Asiara&#8217;s swords raised and ready to strike, Asiara heard him start on a second spell.&nbsp; Just as both blades swiped through the air, aiming to cut his body into three pieces, he vanished.&nbsp; Dathaka quickly recovered from the momentum of the swing and turned Asiara&#8217;s body around.

Sure enough, Calean stood behind her, chanting once again.&nbsp; The spell that he cast took a remarkably small amount of time, especially considering the power that must have lain behind it, for as soon as he had finished, a horrendous roar occurred to Asiara&#8217;s left.&nbsp; Dathaka turned her head to look, and Asiara saw a huge dragon looking down upon them both, it&#8217;s talons ready to slice her to ribbons, and its neck recoiling in the way that meant it was preparing to breath its deadly breath.

It only took Asiara a moment to realize how pointless this spell had been &#8211; the dragon was clearly an illusion.&nbsp; But as Dathaka turned her head back towards the young mage, Asiara saw that this simple illusion had already served its purpose.&nbsp; The spell Calean had been casting earlier &#8211; the one that seemed to have no effect &#8211; had, in fact, conjured a small magical dart.&nbsp; Then, when Asiara&#8217;s head turned to look at the illusory dragon, he had thrown that dart at the exposed and vulnerable snake head still propped next to Asiara&#8217;s right ear.

The dart struck the snake right between the eyes, piercing the skin and killing it instantly.&nbsp; As the reptile died, its muscles went limp, and Asiara felt her lungs practically erupt as she loudly took in a deep and frantic gasp of sweet, life-giving air.&nbsp; She dropped both of her swords and she could feel Dathaka&#8217;s spirit simultaneously being driven out of her body.&nbsp; The snake fell from her naked body and Asiara dropped to her knees &#8211; but it was Asiara that was dropping to her knees &#8211; not Dathaka; her body was her own once again.&nbsp; She could feel Dathaka&#8217;s presence around her, trying desperately to reenter her, to trap her mind once again, to make her body her puppet.&nbsp; But as Asiara continued to inhale, Dathaka&#8217;s hold on her became weaker and weaker until, eventually, with her lungs full of life once again, Asiara felt the Goddess dissipate into the breeze that swept across the battlefield.

Her lungs finally full, Asiara exhaled.&nbsp; With this exhale came the longest, most desperate moan that she had ever voiced in her life.&nbsp; Though Dathaka&#8217;s spirit was gone, Asiara still didn&#8217;t feel completely in control of her body as the sudden overwhelming need that struck her compelled her to immediately begin stroking her wet sex with one hand while the other kneaded furiously at her breasts, pinching the sensitive nipples that, despite all of her previous climaxes, had yet to receive any attention.

In mere moments, Asiara was doubled over as yet another climax threatened to rip her body and her consciousness apart.&nbsp; With the Goddess no longer inside of her, her body was no longer capable of withstanding the level of arousal that she was achieving.&nbsp; For several moments, the pleasure pushed her past sanity, and she was nothing more than a helpless, thrashing, quaking body in the middle of a furious battlefield.&nbsp; Each touch on her nipples spurred her deeper and deeper into erotic oblivion, and the hand at her sex pulled climax after climax out of her.

The intensity of the pleasure brought Asiara to a dangerous precipice.&nbsp; At the very moment that she regained control of her body and freed her mind from the clutches of Dathaka, she also achieved such an immensity of pleasure that it threatened to warp her mind permanently, robbing her of her ability to ever again think of anything other than her sexual needs.&nbsp; But Asiara was too strong for that.&nbsp; She focused on the pleasure, but refused to allow it to completely consume her.&nbsp; Instead, she used it, channeling the divine levels of pleasure that Dathaka had allowed her, using it to infuse her body with the Goddess&#8217;s power, even though the Goddess&#8217;s spirit was no longer within her.

As her vision slowly cleared, Asiara could feel both the arousal and the strength of Dathaka&#8217;s former presence flowing through her.&nbsp; She opened her eyes to see Calean kneeling over her sweat soaked body, his hand held high keeping a magical barrier around them both, protecting them from the fighting happening around them.

Asiara did her best to pull herself together.&nbsp; She stood, taking her swords back into her hands.&nbsp; She was still shaky from the intensity of the climaxes she had just endured, and arousal still coursed through her.&nbsp; The exhaustion that resulted from everything that happened to her also permeated her body.&nbsp; But she had been touched by a Goddess, and she had refused to let all of the resulting power to flee from her as Dathaka was driven out of her body.&nbsp; Ignoring her own nakedness, she raced beyond the boundaries of Calean&#8217;s magical protection and entered the fray of battle.&nbsp; As she did so, she called a single command back to the mage.

�Tell the factions on either side to engage the enemy at full force.&nbsp; They don&#8217;t actually have any more forces waiting to flank us.&nbsp; Attack!&nbsp; Attack!�

And with that, she put her swords in motion.

Never before had Asiara felt so in control of her body.&nbsp; And never before had her body felt so strong; so fast; and so deadly.&nbsp; She was perhaps not quite as strong as she had been when Dathaka had controlled her, but her abilities prior to the Goddess&#8217;s possession, though formidable, were a mere shade of what she was now capable of.&nbsp; Moving through the battlefield, she began cutting down the Sersiphi as though they were mere practice dummies.&nbsp; Here soldiers, recognizing that she was free of the Goddess&#8217;s control, began to rally around her, making her the human point to a military blade that cut through the opposition with ease.

Meanwhile, the Sersiphi, now robbed of their Goddess&#8217;s leadership and skill on the battlefield, began to panic.&nbsp; Many of their warriors turned and ran, and those that remained were cut down easily by the well-trained forces of Asiara&#8217;s army.&nbsp; It took only a few minutes for her troops to finish off all resistance, and as they did so, she scanned the other parts of the battle to see how they were going.

They were going quite well.&nbsp; No longer worried about a flanking maneuver, the factions on either side of the battle had charged the Sersiphi forces, and made short work of them.&nbsp; Asiara scanned the battle field, trying desperately to find the auburn haired woman who had been behind everything that had happened to her.&nbsp; She was happy to have turned the tide of battle, but more than anything, she wanted to find that woman.&nbsp; To make her pay.&nbsp; To make her suffer.&nbsp; But she was nowhere to be found.

Though, frustrated at not being able to find her captor, Asiara nonetheless felt a slight thrill at the sight before her.&nbsp; After coming dangerously close to defeat, Asiara&#8217;s forces, with their leader back at their head, had quickly turned the tide of battle and slaughtered the Sersiphi army.&nbsp; Their rebellion was over.&nbsp; The battle was won.

But it had come at a heavy cost.&nbsp; Though the end of the battle had been a dramatic victory, the beginning had taken a far greater toll on Asiara&#8217;s forces than she had ever anticipated &#8211; and many of the losses had come via her own blades.&nbsp; Scanning her forces, she suddenly worried that her Queen would be upset &#8211; after all, this was supposed to have been a routine bit of policing, not an epic battle.&nbsp; Soon, they were supposed to invade the Southern Kingdom, but that would be a difficult fight in the best of times.&nbsp; With a slightly depleted army, that task would be much more difficult.

As she scanned what was left of her forces, the fatigue that had been slowly settling on her body caught up to her in a rush.

With her army cheering her return, as well as their victory, Asiara felt her body give way.&nbsp; She fell to one knee, then slowly keeled over, feinting as her mind and body could take no more�

[b]The Betrayer[/b] by Hypnohypno

[b]Chapter 4[/b]

When she awoke, she was back in her own tent, in the army&#8217;s camp.&nbsp; She was lying in her makeshift bed, which was nothing more than a pile of animal skins, the last of which was draped over her.&nbsp; She could sense that her body had been washed, and her dark curls were no longer in the disheveled state that they had been in during the battle.

It was night, and Asiara could only see by the light of two candles that had been set at the foot of her bed.&nbsp; She could hear sounds of subdued revelry as the surviving members of the army celebrated their victory, yet mourned the loss of so many of their comrades.&nbsp; The first thought that crossed her mind was, once again, the extent of their losses &#8211; far more than ever should have happened.

What would the Queen think?&nbsp; Asiara shuddered to think of it.&nbsp; Still, she would have no choice but to return to her Queen and inform her of what had happened.&nbsp; It would be a long march, much like another march that she had once made to the Queen&#8217;s castle.&nbsp; But Asiara decided not to think of that.

�I see you&#8217;re awake.�&nbsp; Asiara sat bolt upright, her hand instinctively reaching for the dagger that she always had beside her bed.&nbsp; Her hand found the hilt of the blade, but relaxed when she saw who was speaking to her.&nbsp; Sitting in the corner, mostly covered in the shadows that the candles in the tent cast, was Calean.&nbsp; As Asiara realized who it was, she became aware that her chest was exposed, displaying her nakedness &#8211; and her rock hard nipples that still felt the thrill of battle lust that had inflamed her earlier.

Still, Asiara did nothing to cover herself.&nbsp; After all, Calean had already watched her writhe in orgasm, and seen her fight in the light of day with not&nbsp; a wisp of clothing covering her.&nbsp; And besides, if he was distracted by her naked breasts, that could be to her benefit.&nbsp; Calean had always proven loyal to Asiara, but he was a magi nonetheless, and Asiara had to be careful to keep the upper hand lest he use his magic to try to control her mind or her will.

�I see that you are a voyeur,� was Asiara&#8217;s response to Calean.

�I prefer to think of myself as a concerned and protective ally.&nbsp; You went through quite the ordeal today.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t think you should be left alone.�

�I thank you for your concern,� Asiara said sarcastically while allowing the wry smile that had disarmed so many men and women to spread across her face.

Her body was still charged with sexual energy, and she began to look at Calean as a possible way to discharge it.&nbsp; He was unlike most of the men that she had taken to her bed.&nbsp; They were usually warriors, tall and powerful, with thick muscles and broad shoulders.&nbsp; But Calean was slight.&nbsp; He was by no means short, nor was he skinny or weak.&nbsp; Instead, Asiara could see that underneath her robes he was probably muscular in a wiry manner, his physique the product of casual exercise meant to help sharpen his mind rather than the result of intense physical training.

It would be a welcome change of pace, Asiara mused, though she would have to keep her guard up.

�So tell me,� Asiara purred, �what did you think of the battle today?�

�Well, you were quite the sight to behold.�

�Yes, I imagine so.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not every day that I get to experience having a Goddess inside me.�

�And if what I saw on the battlefield was any indication, she&#8217;s left some traces of her� invasion, inside you, too.�

�Yes, indeed, I think my body is capable of things it never was before.�

�That&#8217;s impressive &#8211; I&#8217;ve heard some rather intense stories about what your body was capable of.�

�I&#8217;m sure you have.&nbsp; Do you believe all of them?�

�I&#8217;m sure there were elements of truth to what I&#8217;ve heard, but from what I saw on the battlefield, those stories are obsolete now.�

�I suppose.&nbsp; Although I still don&#8217;t know exactly what I&#8217;m capable of now.�

�And how do you propose finding out?�

Asiara flung the pelt that still covered the lower half of her body off of the bed, revealing her entire naked body to the mage sitting in the corner.&nbsp; �I guess we&#8217;ll just have to learn from experience.�&nbsp; Calean slipped from his chair and knelt on the bed.

�Let&#8217;s start by exploring the changes to your senses.�&nbsp; With that, he slid his hand slowly, sensuously up Asiara&#8217;s leg, causing her to gasp.

�Well, if we&#8217;re going to start there then we should explore all of my senses.&nbsp; Why don&#8217;t you disrobe so that my eyes can have something to stimulate them as well as my skin.�

With that, Calean quickly pulled his robe off, revealing his naked body and erect member.&nbsp; Asiara took in the sight before her for just a moment.&nbsp; Calean looked as she had imagined he would &#8211; slim, yet strong.&nbsp; She was going to enjoy this.&nbsp; She just had to be careful not to enjoy it too much.&nbsp; She was quite certain that Calean hadn&#8217;t been waiting in her tent out of genuine concern, and though she was sure that he was looking forward to whatever sexual adventures they were about to embark on, she was also quite certain that his interest in her went beyond physical gratification.&nbsp; She would have to keep a look out for any signs of his spellcasting, as she knew that, if he had the opportunity to cast one of his charms, she would find it very difficult to resist.

The danger of the situation, though, only added to the appeal and as she pulled Calean&#8217;s body against her own, she found herself panting quickly in anticipation of what was to come.&nbsp; Her sex was already slick with her need, and neither one of them saw any purpose in delaying what they both wanted.&nbsp; With a quick thrust he entered her, causing them both to moan.

Aware of the vulnerability of her position, Asiara held Calean&#8217;s hips, keeping him planted firmly inside her, as she rolled over.&nbsp; Now straddling him, she began to rock her hips back and forth, tipping her head back slightly in ecstasy, yet keeping a wary eye on the mage below her.

At the moment, though, she sensed no immediate danger, as Calean seemed to be as focused on pleasure as she was.&nbsp; He had begun to thrust his hips upwards, spearing further into her and increasing the pleasure that both of them felt.&nbsp; His hands went to her breasts, rolling the yearning, sensitive nipples between his deft fingers.&nbsp; This wasn&#8217;t the brutish mauling of her breasts that she was accustomed to from the many warriors she had bedded, nor was it the delicate caress of the many women she had enjoyed.&nbsp; This was something strong, and yet subtle, as hands that had the dexterity to cast complicated spells now worked their magic on her flesh, drawing sensations out of her that no other hands ever had.

For just a moment, Asiara lost herself in the pleasure, but she quickly recovered.&nbsp; Calean was staring up at her, but the look in his eyes was one of lust, not of betrayal.&nbsp; They continued to thrust their sexes together, each reaching new peaks of sexual need, both approaching climax.

But Asiara was finding, once again, that the Goddess&#8217;s lasting legacy in her body was both intense and powerful.&nbsp; She was responding to Calean&#8217;s attention far more than she would normally have expected to, regardless of how deft he was at drawing out her passion.&nbsp; The fire that Dathaka had left inside of her was igniting and pushing Asiara towards her sexual peak much faster than she had expected.

This was the most dangerous time, Asiara realized.&nbsp; If Calean planned to try to cast a spell on her, the moment of her climax would be the most likely time for him to make the attempt.&nbsp; As she felt the familiar levels of arousal flowing through her, and heard her moans reaching the tell-tale pitch, she did everything she could to maintain enough focus to react if Calean tried anything.

But then, she was rocked with another surprise.&nbsp; Just as she had experienced while Dathaka still inhabited her body, Asiara&#8217;s capacity for pleasure was now greater than it had previously been.&nbsp; She crossed the threshold that would have usually resulted in a powerful, quivering orgasm, but this time, it only resulted in a greater level of arousal.&nbsp; She closed her eyes and her concentration slipped as she was overwhelmed by this surprising sensation &#8211; rather than achieve release her body simply craved climax to a still greater and greater degree.&nbsp; She moaned in frustration, and tried to will her body to orgasm, but instead her need simply grew.

In the meantime, there was an odd chanting in her ears, and this only seemed to fuel her passion still more.&nbsp; Opening her eyes, she saw that one reason she was being so deeply affected was that she was having sex with the most beautiful man she had ever met.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t know why she had never noticed it before, but Calean was simply overwhelming, and she suddenly wanted him more than anyone else she had ever seen.&nbsp; He was staring at her intently, and his mouth was forming words &#8211; strange words, in a language she didn&#8217;t know &#8211; and this only added to his allure.

Her arousal continued to grow, and she could feel Calean&#8217;s member driving her sex wild with desire.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the words that Calean was speaking seemed to penetrate Asiara&#8217;s mind just as deeply, filling her hazy, lust saturated thoughts with passion, need, and� love.&nbsp; Yes, Asiara realized, she was falling in love with Calean.&nbsp; Perhaps that was why her body was achieving such epic levels of erotic need &#8211; Calean was more than just another sexual partner &#8211; he was the man that she had been waiting for.&nbsp; She would be his, not just physically, but emotionally as well.&nbsp; Tears streamed from her eyes as the pure joy of this realization spread through her, spurring on her erotic need still more even as her feelings swelled with a new sense of completeness and fulfillment.&nbsp; She would love Calean.&nbsp; She would give him her body and her soul.&nbsp; She would obey him, and be whatever he wished.&nbsp; He was more to her than her own climax.&nbsp; He was more to her than her own power.&nbsp; He was more to her than� her� Queen?

That thought momentarily shook Asiara&#8217;s mind out of its trance &#8211; her devotion to her Queen was so deep, so ingrained in her, that thoughts of another replacing her gave Asiara a moment of clarity.&nbsp; Calean, for all of his beauty, and for all of Asiara&#8217;s deep love for him, was casting some sort of spell on her that she had to break.&nbsp; Fighting to regain her focus through her lust starved and love inspired mind, Asiara knew that soon she would give in; soon his spell would have such a strong hold on her that even her devotion to her Queen wouldn&#8217;t be able to overcome it.&nbsp; In her last, flashing moment of clarity, she realized that there was only one way out.

She loved Calean.&nbsp; She craved Calean.&nbsp; And she wanted, more than anything, to please him.&nbsp; Yes, she would please him.&nbsp; She would show him how much she desired him.&nbsp; She began focusing her need, timing the quaking of her hips and thighs with his thrusts.&nbsp; She utilized the muscles inside her to further stimulate his member, channeling all of her sexual energy; utilizing the new levels of erotic bliss that she had discovered; to please the one man that meant more to her than any other.&nbsp; The brief moment of doubt that she had had was gone &#8211; thoughts of her Queen had vanished &#8211; all that she would take from that one hateful moment when she had believed that someone other than Calean could be important to her was that pleasing him was the only way to do her duty.

Clamping down on his member, she began lifting her hips, letting him slide partially out of her, then thrusting herself back down on him.&nbsp; She repeated this, letting the friction spur her own need on, even as it had an obvious effect on him.&nbsp; His chanting still filled her mind, and she reveled in it, coming closer and closer to the climax that she had been craving for quite some time.&nbsp; But her climax was secondary &#8211; right now she was only there to please him, and so she used all of her experience, all of her passion, and all of her love to stimulate Calean as powerfully as she could.

And then, the chanting faltered.&nbsp; She heard the mysterious words dissolve as Calean&#8217;s body tensed beneath her.&nbsp; Looking down, she saw that he was no longer the perfect specimen of manhood that she had seen moments before &#8211; he was attractive, sure, but certainly not worthy of her awe.&nbsp; She heard him starting to moan deeply and, in a flash of realization, she pulled herself off of him, rolling to the other side of the bed just as his shaft erupted, spewing his seed harmlessly into the air, his voice, previously so magical and entrancing, was now nothing more than a series of panting moans.

The spell broken, Asiara acted quickly.&nbsp; She reached for the dagger at her bedside and quickly brought it to Calean&#8217;s throat.&nbsp; Still quivering in his own orgasm, his eyes bolted open when he felt the cold steal pressed against his skin.

�Nice try, you bastard!�&nbsp; Asiara&#8217;s rage poured out of her with an intensity that could almost match the desire that still coursed through her veins.

�I, I� just��

�I know what you wanted.&nbsp; You wanted to turn me into your slave.&nbsp; But don&#8217;t even think of trying to cast a spell now.&nbsp; One word of magic and I&#8217;ll cut your throat.&nbsp; I might do it anyway.�

�You� you can&#8217;t,� Calean was still struggling to speak following the intensity of what he had just experienced, �you� you need me.�

�Your little spell is broken, you fool.�

�N, no� I mean, you need my skills.&nbsp; I&#8217;m the only magi you have left.&nbsp; You can&#8217;t afford to kill me.�

Asiara knew that he was right.&nbsp; �You might be right about that.&nbsp; But rest assured, if you ever try something like this again, whether you are the last mage in my army, or the last man in the realm, I will slit your throat without a second thought.&nbsp; Do you understand?�

�Yes.&nbsp; I understand.&nbsp; Now, please, can I go.�

Asiara thought for a moment.&nbsp; She knew she couldn&#8217;t do anything to jeopardize her one remaining mage.&nbsp; That meant she couldn&#8217;t cut out his tongue or remove the appendage that she most wanted to, as either of those possibilities would ruin his voice.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t cut off his fingers, either, as those were crucial to spellcasting.&nbsp; As much as she hated to admit it, she needed his abilities &#8211; at least until she could return to the Queen and get reinforcements.&nbsp; Withdrawing the blade from Calean&#8217;s throat, she heard the young magi breathe a sigh of relief.

That sigh was short lived, however, as Asiara suddenly plunged the dagger deep into Calean&#8217;s thigh, severing the muscle tissue, and causing him to scream in pain.

�I won&#8217;t weaken you ability to cast spells, but a mage doesn&#8217;t need to be able to run.�&nbsp; As she said this, she reached for his robe and tossed it over his wounded leg.&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t bleed on my bed.&nbsp; Wrap yourself up, and take yourself to a healer� NOW!�

Clearly filled with rage, but helpless to do anything about it, Calean crawled clumsily to his feet and half limped, half dragged himself out of Asiara&#8217;s tent, groaning in pain the entire time.&nbsp; When he had closed the flap to the entrance, Asiara flopped back on her bed.

Her body was still aflame with intense arousal &#8211; she had never gotten to reach climax, and now her body screamed with its need for release.&nbsp; Still, the anger surging through her, as well as the shame she felt at having come so close to falling for Calean&#8217;s betrayal, caused her to lose the motivation to finger herself to orgasm.&nbsp; Besides, that seemed anti-climactic given the heights to which her arousal had brought her.

No, she decided, what she needed was some fresh air, and a chance to collect her thoughts.&nbsp; After all, she hadn&#8217;t had a chance to think over the events that had occurred in the past day, nor had she had time to contemplate how to regroup her remaining forces and make her way back to the Queen.&nbsp; Though her body was practically shaking with need, she decided to put off her release and go for a walk.&nbsp; Pulling on a simple pair of breeches, her boots, and a loose fitting shirt, she strapped her swords to her waist and stepped out of her tent.

She could hear Calean screaming in pain a few tents away as the camp&#8217;s healers removed the dagger from his thigh.&nbsp; Even in her intense state of frustration, that sound brought a smile to her lips.&nbsp; Calean would walk with a limp for the rest of his life &#8211; and he deserved far worse.&nbsp; Taking a deep breath of the cool night air, Asiara walked through the camp before reaching its outer limits.

A couple of guards saluted her as she passed.&nbsp; They looked at her with puzzled glances as she made her way outside of the camp.&nbsp; She just laughed as concern slowly entered their expression.&nbsp; She wondered what stories they had heard about the Goddess that had been inside of her.

�Don&#8217;t worry, boys, I&#8217;m in my right mind.&nbsp; I just need some time to think, that&#8217;s all.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll be back in a little bit.�

�Yes, Captain.�

With her heart still pounding and her sex on fire, Asiara made her way into the wilderness.&nbsp; It was a dangerous place, but she had Phyxilir and Finisher, and the power &#8211; and lust &#8211; of a Goddess still pulsing within her.

She was ready for anything that might cross her path.

[b]The Lake and the Lady[/b] by Hypnohypno

[b]Chapter 5[/b]

As Asiara strode through the wilderness, she found herself suffering from multiple levels of frustration.&nbsp; First, she was furious that her army had been depleted so much by what should have been a routine battle.&nbsp; But that would be something that she would work out with Partheon later.

Even more bothersome was that she felt that her victory was incomplete.&nbsp; The auburn haired woman who had captured her, then brought her to orgasm, thus allowing Dathaka to enter her body, had escaped.&nbsp; She was no longer a threat &#8211; the Sirsiphi had been so completely routed that she would struggle to put together a prayer circle, never mind a fighting force worth even mentioning.&nbsp; But still, Asiara wasn&#8217;t accustomed to a woman, or anyone for that matter, getting the best of her, even temporarily.&nbsp; That woman had almost defeated Asiara, and Asiara wanted revenge.

Still, the battle against the Sirsiphi hadn&#8217;t been a total disaster.&nbsp; Though she had lost more than ten times the number of soldiers that she had anticipated &#8211; many by her own blade &#8211; as well as all of her own personal body guards, she had gained something quite valuable: the residual powers of the goddess, Dathaka.&nbsp; With every move she made, Asiara could feel the strength, speed, and agility that she now possessed.&nbsp; Perhaps her new skills wouldn&#8217;t be enough to replace the soldiers that she had lost, but they would come close.&nbsp; And at least for the short term, her enemies wouldn&#8217;t know about these powers, so she could scheme battle plans that would take them by surprise.&nbsp; Her campaign into the Maurial Kingdom could still happen.

But Asiara&#8217;s troops weren&#8217;t her only concern.&nbsp; Even her new powers couldn&#8217;t begin to replace the advantage that powerful magi gave to an army.&nbsp; And she had slaughtered two of the best while Dathaka possessed her.&nbsp; This loss, though, wasn&#8217;t one that bothered her too much.&nbsp; After all, the ease with which they fell made her wonder just how effective they really were.&nbsp; No, the greater loss was Calean.&nbsp; His injury, though completely necessary and deserved, would limit his usefulness in any immediate battles.&nbsp; His spell casting would still be what it had always been, but his lack of mobility would make it difficult for him to move to different parts of the battlefield where he might be needed.&nbsp; He would have to rely on teleportation spells, and those could be draining.

Even this dilemma, though, didn&#8217;t completely discourage Asiara from continuing her assault on the Southern Lands.&nbsp; She still had the help of several lesser magi, and while their individual skills might not be all that useful, she could use them to teleport Calean to different points on the battle field.&nbsp; Asiara&#8217;s agile military mind had already begun to imagine a new approach to war &#8211; one centered less on a vast army and several powerful magi, but instead one in which a single warrior, touched with divinity, and a powerful magi being teleported quickly around the battlefield would produce strategies that her opponents had never seen &#8211; and wouldn&#8217;t know how to defeat.

But even with the reassurance that all was not lost, Asiara still couldn&#8217;t overcome her greatest frustration: the pulsing sexual need that burned throughout her entire body.&nbsp; Calean&#8217;s spell had been so strong that she had to break it when she had the chance, and that had meant that she had not achieved the release that she craved.&nbsp; She had thought of masturbating, but that somehow just didn&#8217;t seem like it would satisfy her.&nbsp; Her lust, like her battle skills, had been touched by the divine, and satisfaction would require far more drastic measures than simply playing with herself.

So, in an attempt to calm herself down and clear her mind, she walked through the wilderness, letting the bright light of Neda, the green moon, show her the way.

Not that there was much to see.&nbsp; The land of the Sirsiphi was, for the most part, unremarkable. It consisted of just rolling, grassy hills, punctuated with the occasional group of trees &#8211; trees that only rarely amounted to what could even be called a small forest.

She was just approaching one of the larger clumps of these trees when she spotted a figure in the distance, just at the top of a nearby hill.&nbsp; Asiara was far enough away that she couldn&#8217;t make out many details, but judging by the long hair that she saw fluttering in the breeze, she assumed that the figure was female.&nbsp; She also had her back turned to Asiara.

�Good,� Asiara thought, �I can approach her carefully and find out more about her before she realizes I&#8217;m here.�

Asiara crept closer to the woman, keeping a careful eye on her.&nbsp; It would be unusual for someone to be out in the middle of the night like this.&nbsp; There were any number of creatures that could roam in the night that a single person would be loath to face.&nbsp; Even Asiara, if not for her new fighting prowess, would hesitate to walk alone in the wilderness at night.&nbsp; This woman was either confident in her power, or a fool.&nbsp; Asiara didn&#8217;t intend to take any chances.

She became still more wary as she got closer.&nbsp; As Asiara made her way up the grassy slope, she could see that the woman was unarmed.&nbsp; That could only mean one thing &#8211; the woman must be a mage of some sort.&nbsp; It was unthinkable that this woman would be foolish enough to walk through these lands without a weapon unless she could call on magic to protect her.&nbsp; Placing her hands on the hilts of her two blades, Asiara made her way as quietly as she could towards the woman, who still hadn&#8217;t seemed to notice her.

But then, Asiara saw something that made her stop in her tracks.&nbsp; From a distance, and with only the pale green light of Neda to aid her eyes, it had been difficult to make out the color of the woman&#8217;s hair.&nbsp; But now, as she came within a few meters of the woman standing stoically on the hilltop, there was no mistaking it &#8211; the woman&#8217;s hair was auburn, just like that of the Sersiphi woman.

At just that moment, the woman turned towards Asiara, immediately confirming her suspicions.&nbsp; It was the same woman!&nbsp; This time, though, Asiara wouldn&#8217;t underestimate her.&nbsp; Drawing both of her blades, she watched to see what the woman&#8217;s first move would be &#8211; ready to dodge any darts that the woman might have at the ready.

But the woman made no move to attack.&nbsp; Instead, she simply stared at Asiara for a a few moments, and then ran down the hill, to Asiara&#8217;s right.&nbsp; Asiara immediately realized what she was doing &#8211; she was fleeing to the large clump of trees at the bottom of the hill.&nbsp; With Phyxilir and Finisher gleaming in the moonlight, Asiara raced down the hill after the auburn haired woman, intent on catching her before she reached the cover of the trees.

But the woman was fast, and even Asiara&#8217;s enhanced physical prowess wasn&#8217;t enough for her to close the entire gap before the woman slipped into the small forest.&nbsp; Cursing, Asiara plunged into the forest in pursuit, knowing that it would be difficult to track her in the forest&#8217;s dim light.&nbsp; Still, her powerful and lithe body moved quickly and gracefully through the trees, and she could just make out the movement of her prey as she danced through the underbrush.

Then, Asiara heard a strange sound.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t coming from the woman she was chasing, but from some other source &#8211; somewhere to her left.&nbsp; She knew that she should continue her pursuit, but something about this sound demanded her attention.&nbsp; It was music, soft and lyrical.&nbsp; Asiara slowed down as the strains of melody made their way to her ears, caressing them, and beckoning for their attention.

But then, she remembered her task.&nbsp; Shaking her head slightly, and doing her best to ignore the music, she squinted in the darkness to try to locate the auburn haired woman.&nbsp; �Damn!� she thought, �I&#8217;ve lost track of her.�&nbsp; She slowed her pace to a walk as she scanned the surrounding trees, looking for any sign of the woman she had been chasing.&nbsp; All the while, the gentle hum of sound seemed to dance around her.

Still breathing heavily from running so fast, the pulse in her ears drowned out some of the delicate sound, but still, she could hear it well enough to want to hear more, and to hear more clearly.&nbsp; She tried to focus, but the sound &#8211; no, she realized, the singing &#8211; was elusive.&nbsp; It was somehow haunting, and yet enticing, but always the strains of the voice changed just as she was starting to realize just what mood it was evoking.

She felt compelled to walk towards the music, but she stopped herself.&nbsp; She was here to find the auburn-haired woman, not to listen to some strange music.&nbsp; 

But still, it was so enticing.

She wasn&#8217;t sure which her prey had gone, so, she figured, going towards the music was as likely a direction as any.&nbsp; Besides, if the auburn-haired woman found the music even half as compelling as Asiara did, she would be headed that way as well.&nbsp; Slowly, Asiara started to move towards it.

The singing had an elegance that called for soft, slow movement.&nbsp; Running towards its source just wouldn&#8217;t do.&nbsp; Asiara listened intently, and stepped lightly, almost sensuously, on the soft leaves beneath her feet as the sound drew her closer.

And as she drew nearer, the sound was becoming slightly louder.&nbsp; Asiara&#8217;s breath had already calmed, and she could hear the music more clearly now.&nbsp; But hearing it more clearly didn&#8217;t make it easier for her to make sense of.&nbsp; In fact, if anything, it had become more elusive as its varied strains and lilting vibrations &#8211; which seemed to hover on the edge of discernable words, without ever quite coalescing into recognizable syllables &#8211; caressed her ears more forcefully.

But it wasn&#8217;t just her ears, Asiara realized.&nbsp; She could feel the music vibrating inside of her, dancing in her mind, teasing her thoughts, telling her things that she couldn&#8217;t quite comprehend.&nbsp; It was soothing to simply let the melodies push her other thoughts aside, to simply let the music enter her, to make her its instrument.

No!&nbsp; Asiara shook her head again.&nbsp; She had just freed herself of the influence of a goddess, she wasn&#8217;t about to succumb to another assault on her will.&nbsp; Doing her best to ignore the strands of melody floating around her, she took a step backwards, determined to get out of this forest.

After taking another few steps back, Asiara realized how heavily she was breathing.&nbsp; She had recovered from her earlier run already, but still her heart was pounding heavily in her chest.&nbsp; The brief run through the woods had temporarily distracted her, but her arousal was still just as intense as it had been before she had seen the auburn haired woman.&nbsp; Now, she was aware of it again, only it, like her own thoughts, was starting to respond to the ebb and flow of the song that was penetrating her, calming her even as it turned her on.&nbsp; She could feel the vibrations of the sound teasing her sex, causing her thighs to quiver, and her breasts to pulse in time.

In fact, Asiara&#8217;s whole body seemed to be pulsing in time to the singing &#8211; only it wasn&#8217;t a rhythm that she had ever heard before.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t consciously make sense of it, but she knew that this sound was stimulating her body in ways that she couldn&#8217;t ignore.&nbsp; The earlier encounter with Calean flitted through her mind &#8211; the arousal that she&#8217;d felt; her discovery of the new heights of ecstasy she was now capable of; the spell he had tried to cast.

The spell!&nbsp; She had resisted Calean&#8217;s magic, she had to resist this song as well!&nbsp; Shaking free of the trance that had started to cloud her mind, she found that she had already walked back into the forest far further than her previous retreat had taken her.&nbsp; This sound was pulling her towards it without her even realizing it.&nbsp; Backing away a bit more frantically this time, Asiara sheathed her swords and put her hands over her ears in an attempt to block out the sounds that were having such an effect on her.

But her hands weren&#8217;t enough.&nbsp; The music was inside of her, teasing her most sensitive areas, coaxing her pleasure into a harmony of desire that she fought to resist.&nbsp; Closing her eyes, she tried to focus on resisting; on holding on to the control that she had only regained from Dathaka earlier that morning.

But closing her eyes proved to be the worst thing she could have done.&nbsp; Without the sense of sight, her other senses became more sensitive &#8211; more aware.&nbsp; She still held her hands over her ears, but now it was the sense of touch more than any other that was responding to the music&#8217;s melodic strands.&nbsp; It&#8217;s vibrations hummed through her, causing her to shake with arousal.&nbsp; No person&#8217;s hands, not even Calean&#8217;s deft touch, could stimulate her breasts and nipples with such maddening, perfect stimulation.

When she opened her eyes again, Asiara found that she had somehow been traveling forward, walking only through the guidance of the song.&nbsp; A long, sensual gasp escaped her lungs as she realized that the sound had finally drawn her to out of the trees to a small glade.&nbsp; Through lidded eyes, she saw that she was in a clearing consisting of a small patch of grass and a large pond, its rippled surface reflecting the pale green light of the moon.

And as her eyes took in this lovely sight, the voice continued to draw her forward, wrapping itself around her, caressing her, thrilling her, controlling her.&nbsp; Fighting to regain control, Asiara focused on one last desperate attempt to flee from this music and regain control of herself.&nbsp; She stepped back into the woods, forcing her legs to move in reverse, even though every fiber of her being wanted to move forward &#8211; to let that song give her body the pleasure it craved.

This first step was followed by another, and then another.&nbsp; With each step, Asiara felt herself growing stronger as she proved her ability to resist.&nbsp; With her hands still clamped firmly over her ears, she backed further and further away.

The pond was barely visible now, as the glade began to recede into the underbrush, and Asiara continued to back away.&nbsp; Growing more and more confident.&nbsp; More and more in control.&nbsp; But then, her motion stopped &#8211; she had backed into someone standing behind her.

Asiara&#8217;s reactions were slow as so much of her focus was on resisting the song that threatened to take control of her.&nbsp; It took her a few moments to even realize what had just happened.&nbsp; In those moments, a soft, feminine tongue traced up her neck and then cool lips blew gently on her ear.&nbsp; Asiara&#8217;s body was so tightly strung with need that these sensations caused a deep, longing moan to escape her throat.

Before she could react in any other way, the woman&#8217;s hands grasped Asiara&#8217;s wrists and drew her hands away from her ears.&nbsp; Now able to hear once again, the full power of the music washed over her mind.&nbsp; That, combined with the touch she had just felt was simply too much.&nbsp; The power that the goddess had given to her body was of no consequence now.&nbsp; Asiara simply yielded to the demands of the music, making her way gracefully back towards the pond while her mind and body continued to seethe with sexual energy that seemed to fall into harmonic unison with the pulsing sounds around her.&nbsp; She was so enraptured by the sounds and the sensations that she was barely even aware of the rustling of leaves and snapping of twigs that signaled the retreat of the woman who had just been behind her.&nbsp; That woman had escaped the power of the music, but Asiara was proving far less lucky.

She still knew that something was wrong with all of this, but the sheer beauty of the music enraptured her mind.&nbsp; Maybe the experience with Calean had tired her, or maybe her sexual frustration had left her more vulnerable, but whatever the reason, she simply let the sound guide her, it&#8217;s subtle commands compelling her to move closer and closer to the water.&nbsp; As she neared the water&#8217;s edge, Asiara languidly reached towards her boots and slipped them off.&nbsp; Standing just beyond the water, she slowly slid her pants off of her legs, kicking them away, before unbuckling her sword belt and letting her blades fall uselessly to the grass covered ground.

Then, she waded into the water, feeling its sandy bottom on her feet and between her toes as the coolness of the pool caused her to gasp once again.&nbsp; She took several steps into the water, and then felt a compulsion to stop, as the singing now seemed to be thrilling through her entire being, body and mind.&nbsp; There was another sound added to it now &#8211; a sound that was coming from Asiara&#8217;s own mouth: the sound of moans.

But even these moans seemed to blend with the music around her, brushing away her own thoughts, filling her with desire, rifling through every sensitive part of her body.

Then, in the center of the pool, the water began to ripple, and rise, and slowly, gracefully, fluidly, coalesce.&nbsp; Through her lustful, will-less eyes, Asiara saw a face with two large, penetrating eyes and surrounded by lush, wavy, silver hair.&nbsp;&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t tell if the face had broken through to the surface of the water, or if it had been formed from the water itself.&nbsp; Either way, the result was breathtaking, and Asiara could only stare, her body and mind obeying the unspoken command to remain still, as she saw the luscious woman&#8217;s lips moving, singing, producing the sounds that held Asiara so deeply enthralled, so helplessly obedient, and so desperately aroused.

The singing continued as the figure in the middle of the lake continued to rise out of the water, revealing an exquisite naked body, with light, flawless skin, and a figure as graceful and fluid as the substance from which she had emerged.&nbsp; She rose from the water until her long, slender legs had completely emerged, and she was simply standing in the middle of the pool, her alluring feet standing on the surface of the water as if it were solid ground.

Asiara was so lost in this erotic, enticing spectacle, that she didn&#8217;t even notice her own feet starting to sink, the sand at the lake&#8217;s bottom slowly engulfing both of her feet, trapping her where she stood.&nbsp; 

But such trivialities refused to penetrate into her foggy, lust clouded mind.&nbsp; All she could do was stare and listen as the woman before her walked across the water; coming closer; allowing Asiara to see her in glorious motion.&nbsp; As she drew near, Asiara could see the pale green moonlight reflecting off of the woman&#8217;s wet skin, causing her to shimmer.&nbsp; The vision before her was almost as entrancing to Asiara as the song that continued to pour into her mind, engulfing her own thoughts and drenching her in sexual need.

Asiara could hear her own moans continuously &#8211; as if they were now providing a rhythmic bass that worked in counterpoint to the lovely melody dancing from the lips of the splendid woman who now stood before her.&nbsp; The humming of that sound, the vibrations of the air, seemed to strike every nerve in Asiara&#8217;s body, and she felt herself completely overcome with lust.&nbsp; As the woman stepped directly in front of her, Asiara wanted desperately to reach out for her, to take her in her arms, as she had done with so many other women.&nbsp; She wanted to push her down on her back, into the water, and to ravish her, making use of the beautiful body to finally achieve the release that she craved.

But she couldn&#8217;t move.&nbsp; The song continued to bind her, to control her.&nbsp; She could only stare at the object of her desire.&nbsp; The woman reached out, cupping Asiara&#8217;s breasts in her hands.&nbsp; She slowly started to circle her hands around each breast, teasing the nipples through Asiara&#8217;s thin shirt.&nbsp; Asiara could feel the shirt clinging to her sensitive skin, as the woman&#8217;s hands seemed to leave a trail of water wherever they caressed Asiara.&nbsp; Indeed, it wasn&#8217;t long before the woman began stroking Asiara&#8217;s sides, and as she did so, wetness slipped down Asiara&#8217;s skin, gliding over her naked hips and legs, lighting up her nerve endings and making her quiver in anticipation.

Next, the woman reached forward, taking Asiara&#8217;s shirt in her hands and, with a single powerful pull, ripped the fabric down the front.&nbsp; In one smooth motion, she slipped the ruined shirt off of Asiara&#8217;s body, leaving the beautiful warrior woman standing naked, ankle deep in the water with rivulets of liquid dancing over her body, driving her wild with lust.

And all the while, the song continued to waltz over her mind, controlling her; subduing her.&nbsp; The woman raised her hands just above Asiara&#8217;s breasts, and from her palms a cascade of water drops fell onto Asiara&#8217;s taught nipples, teasing her breasts, forcing her to tip her head back and scream in sexual frustration.&nbsp; She wanted to have this woman now, but the song continued to lock her in place, to force her to endure this erotic torment.

Then, abruptly, the singing stopped.&nbsp; For just a moment, the two women gazed at each other in silence.&nbsp; Then, realizing that the spell had been broken, Asiara launched herself at the woman, intent upon satisfying the desires that had been trapped within her all this time.

But as her arms reached for the woman, ready to grasp her and pull her into a passionate embrace, Asiara was shocked to find that her arms passed right through the woman, as though her body were nothing more than water!&nbsp; This unexpected result, combined with her not realizing that her feet were now trapped in the sand, caused her to fall forward, and before she knew it she was on all fours, with her forearms partially under water and her hands now stuck in the sand in the same way that her ankles already were.

Finally free of the music that had subdued her, she was able to realize the dire situation she was now in &#8211; trapped with this water spirit, whose intentions she still did not know.&nbsp; But her thoughts were almost immediately distracted as she saw the woman step around her trapped body, taking a position behind her.&nbsp; The woman knelt behind her, and began running her hands up and down Asiara&#8217;s back.&nbsp; The trapped woman responded immediately, as the water spirit, though seemingly made of liquid moments before, now had taken on a more tangible form, and was using her hands to massage and tease Asiara&#8217;s sensitive flesh.

It wasn&#8217;t long before the hands circled around and once again began to fondle Asiara&#8217;s breasts, pinching the nipples and causing Asiara to scream in sexual need and frustration.&nbsp; Through her own wailing, Asiara was only dimly aware of the water nymph as she withdrew her hands from Asiara&#8217;s breasts and, from the rear, slipped them between her legs, sending a whole new wave of sensation racing through the warrior woman&#8217;s body.&nbsp; The hands were skilled, and Asiara could feel the welcome tension in her sex that she knew signaled an impending orgasm.&nbsp; Knowing that its intensity would be unlike anything she had ever felt, Asiara braced herself.

But then, the stimulation stopped.&nbsp; Asiara&#8217;s cry of frustration, though, was cut short, as the water spirit took hold of her hair and pushed her face down, plunging her entire head under water.&nbsp; Asiara&#8217;s arousal was so intense that it took all of her self control to stop panting and hold her breath as the water engulfed her.&nbsp; As she remained trapped, unable to breath, the water spirit slipped her fingers back into Asiara&#8217;s sex and began to stimulate her once again.

It was more than Asiara could take.&nbsp; Her body was quivering on the edge of orgasm, and no matter how hard she fought, she knew that it would overtake her soon.&nbsp; Just as her willpower was about to break, the hand withdrew from her sex again, and a hard yank on her hair pulled her head back out of the water.

Gasping for breath, Asiara couldn&#8217;t believe what was happening to her.&nbsp; She had always been so powerful and dominant with all of her lovers.&nbsp; And yet, here she was, panting desperately in sexual heat, craving release, on all fours, as a beautiful woman fingered her from behind while forcing her head periodically under water.&nbsp; 

What was more shocking, was how much all of it was turning her on.&nbsp; Rather than fighting against what was happening to her, Asiara only wanted it to continue &#8211; all she wanted was for this water nymph to push her over the edge, and for that, Asiara would obey any command.&nbsp; Her lust had come to control her far more powerfully than the song that had enthralled her before &#8211; Asiara&#8217;s newfound capacity for erotic ecstasy left her completely open and vulnerable to this woman who was driving her to erotic heights she had never before experienced.

With her dark curls clinging to her face and her mouth open, gasping for breath, Asiara waited for the spirit to stimulate her sex again.&nbsp; When she felt pressure on the back of her head again, she immediately yielded, letting the woman push her face back into the water, hoping only for the release that had come to consume her every thought and action.&nbsp; As she felt the water closing over her, the stimulation of her sex resumed, and within moments she was shaking on the very edge of climax.

But the climax still didn&#8217;t come.&nbsp; With another hard yank, her head burst from the surface of the water again, and air flowed into her lungs once more.&nbsp; Asiara&#8217;s helplessness only spurred her on.&nbsp; She desperately wanted to be plunged back under the water if that would bring her climax.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t care that she was yielding herself to this spirit, her entire world was reduced to a single desire that was flooding her body and soul.

With another firm push from the spirit, Asiara felt her head being submerged once again, and with it her sex was submerged in a yearning, passionate need.&nbsp; That need was met when she felt the fingers working inside of her again, pushing her higher and higher into her helpless desire.&nbsp; Her lungs burned for air, but her body&#8217;s need for release was still greater.&nbsp; At that moment she would have sucked the entire lake into her lungs if that was what it took to reach climax.&nbsp; Asiara shook in her need.&nbsp; Waiting in frustration for the fingers to slip out of her again, to leave her panting and frustrated.

But this time, the hand remained firm on her head, and the fingers continued to stimulate her sex, the water that sprung from them mingling with the wetness of her sex to produce a perfect balance of friction and motion.&nbsp; Finally, even her goddess touched body could endure no more, and she felt waves of orgasmic pleasure crash over her; around her; through her.&nbsp; Clamping her mouth shut, trying to survive only long enough to feel the full weight of this release, Asiara felt herself become completely saturated with powerful, overwhelming pleasure.&nbsp; Her sex spasmed uncontrollably, and her hips shook violently.&nbsp; Her whole body was quaking in this tsunami of erotic ecstasy.

Whether from the continuing climax or the lack of air she didn&#8217;t know, but stars began to collect in her vision, and her thoughts were starting to fade.&nbsp; Again, and again, and again, the pleasure hit her, engulfing her, submerging her in a world of nothing but erotic release.&nbsp; Her lungs were ready to burst, and she had no choice but to draw a breath.&nbsp; But just before she was able to do so, all consciousness left her, and she knew only sweet, orgasmic darkness�

[b]The Lady[/b] by Hypnohypno

[b]Chapter 6[/b]

When Asiara&#8217;s eyes fluttered open, and she found herself back in her tent, lying in her own bed, her first thought was that it had all been a dream &#8211; a wonderful, satisfying, erotic dream.&nbsp; But that was impossible &#8211; the tingling warmth between her thighs was evidence that her climaxes had been real, and no sexy dream could have ever made her orgasm with such raw intensity.

Sitting up, she saw still more evidence that what had happened had been real.&nbsp; Her shirt was draped around her shoulders, ripped clean in half in the front, and it was still wet.&nbsp; Her hair, too, was still quite damp, the dark curls pressed against her skin were as disheveled as she should feel at the moment.&nbsp; But somehow, despite her confusion, the warm afterglow prevented any feelings of anxiety to seep into her mind.&nbsp; She just felt too good for that.

After a long, languorous stretch, she sat up in her bed and tried to make sense of how she had gotten back to the camp.&nbsp; The dim light of dawn was slipping in through the bottom of the tent, so she knew that some time had passed.&nbsp; Still, she had no memory of walking back to the camp.&nbsp; Shaking her head to clear her thoughts, which kept straying to her last conscious memory &#8211; which in turn caused her to feel wetness start to gather between her legs &#8211; Asiara rose from her bed and slipped off her tattered shirt and the pants that she was somehow wearing again.&nbsp; As she drew a robe around her shoulders, she saw that her swords were lying next to the bed, as were her boots.

Still quite confused, she left the tent, not concerned that her robe left so much of her body exposed.&nbsp; After all, the army had seen her naked on the battle field recently, and she was quite certain that her troops respected her quite thoroughly.&nbsp; Giving them a glimpse of her beauty would only help to keep them under her thumb a bit more.

As she looked around the camp, taking in the quiet bustle that accompanied the morning duties of her soldiers, she saw a young message boy run up to her.

�Partheon would like to speak with you, M&#8217;Lady.�

�Very well, lead me to him.�

Asiara knew what this was about.&nbsp; Partheon was her second in command in military matters, and she hadn&#8217;t spoken to him since the battle with the Sersiphi.&nbsp; He would be anxious to go over the details of the battle and to discuss their plans going forward.

But Asiara found such topics somehow distasteful at the moment.&nbsp; Normally, military strategy would get her blood boiling only slightly less than her exploits between the sheets, but today it seemed oddly unimportant.&nbsp; Every time she tried to think about her responsibilities to her army, even to her Queen, she couldn&#8217;t help but let the tingling in her sex bring her mind back to the lake; to the beautiful water nymph; to submitting to that nymph.

And these thoughts turned her on.

No, military matters were the furthest thing from her mind.&nbsp; Right now, all she wanted to do was to find that lake again, and give herself to the nymph that lived there.&nbsp; And that is exactly what she would do when night fell once again.

Before then, though, she would have to face Partheon.&nbsp; Stepping into his tent, she greeted her trusted friend and advisor.

�Hello, Parth, how have you been?�

Partheon turned his balding head towards her, the grayness of his beard looking particular pale in the morning light.&nbsp; �Better than you, apparently.&nbsp; The watchmen told me they found you lying on the ground outside the camp early this morning in a state of� well, you know.�

�The battle yesterday was quite the ordeal, especially for me.&nbsp; I needed a little� well, you know.�&nbsp; Partheon grinned.&nbsp; Asiara was always glad to have Partheon around.&nbsp; The age difference between them helped to diffuse the sexual tension that made it hard for her to work with so many other leaders in the army.&nbsp; Without that tension, they were able to banter with each other quite freely &#8211; and Asiara suspected that Partheon found her frequent sexual adventures to be quite entertaining.

�I see,� was all he said, though his grin showed that he was using his imagination to fill in the details of Asiara&#8217;s most recent exploits.&nbsp; �Well, according to Calean, you had a pretty good bit of fun even before you left the camp to do whatever it is you did out there.&nbsp; He&#8217;s been bragging that he drove you so wild that you had to stab him to keep from dying from the pleasure.�

�Is that so?&nbsp; I seem to remember it slightly differently.�

�Of course.&nbsp; No one in the camp would ever believe him.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know why you felt the need to stab him, but I&#8217;m sure it wasn&#8217;t because you couldn&#8217;t handle him.&nbsp; If anything, I&#8217;m guessing he wasn&#8217;t enough for you.�

Asiara just gave Partheon the same mischievous, sensual grin that had won the hearts of so many men and women before but that, with Partheon, was simply a sign of her affection for her advisor.

�Let&#8217;s get down to business, shall we?�&nbsp; As much as she enjoyed Partheon&#8217;s company, she wanted to get this conversation over with.&nbsp; She knew what he would have to say, and she knew that he wouldn&#8217;t like her response.

�We need to decide what we&#8217;re going to do and get the army on the move, Asiara.&nbsp; The Maurial army is aware that we were planning to attack, and they&#8217;re already marching.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know if you still plan to engage them or not, but either way, we need to pack up and head out as soon as possible.&nbsp; I&#8217;m told that the men could be ready as early as mid-day today.�

�We&#8217;re not going anywhere.�&nbsp; Partheon&#8217;s mouth dropped in disbelief.&nbsp; �I want to stay camped here tonight.�

�Why?&nbsp; That&#8217;s madness!�

�The Maurial forces don&#8217;t know where we are.&nbsp; They won&#8217;t have heard of the Sersiphi uprising.&nbsp; If anything, they&#8217;ll be expecting us to be on the road headed directly to their kingdom.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll be safe from them here.�

�But even if they don&#8217;t attack us, they&#8217;re marching north, into the Queen&#8217;s lands.&nbsp; We either need to engage them or start recruiting more soldiers and planning where we&#8217;ll take our stand against them.&nbsp; Either way, we can&#8217;t stay here.�

�Parth, have I ever led us astray?�

�Not so far, M&#8217;Lady.�

�I have my reasons, Parth.&nbsp; We stay.�&nbsp; Not wanting to hear any more protests, Asiara swept out of the tent.&nbsp; He was right, she knew.&nbsp; They needed to leave this place.&nbsp; But Asiara couldn&#8217;t help but think about what had happened last night, and what further ecstasies might await her in that glade should she return.

With these thoughts in her mind, she returned to her own tent.

Flopping down on her pallet of hides, Asiara let her mind drift.&nbsp; She imagined being back at the lake, feeling those hands running over her body, leaving trails of wetness behind &#8211; the water droplets snaking over her skin, adding to the erotic intrigue.&nbsp; Her sex grew wet at the thought, and her own hands began to roam over her body, teasing her and filling her with an erotic tension that she knew could only be released by the nymph whom she&#8217;d discovered the night before.

And so she spent the day, fantasizing about what the water spirit would do with her.&nbsp; All day she teased herself, slowly building her sexual need, allowing herself to simmer in a powerful state of arousal.

By the time the sun had set and the green moon had risen, she was practically bursting with anticipation.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t even bother to bring her swords this time.&nbsp; Still wearing her robe, she sauntered out of her tent and made her way past the guards &#8211; her withering look preventing them from questioning her as to her purpose or her attire.

Once in the wilderness, she made her way back to the small forest that she had entered the night before.&nbsp; She felt as though she were in a dream as she walked through the hills, the tall grass feeling wonderful under her bare feet.&nbsp; She knew that she was moving of her own free will, yet there seemed to be some pull that took her directly to her destination, without her even having to think of how to retrace her steps.

Before she knew it, she had entered the forest.&nbsp; And, as she did so, a familiar and welcome sensation flowed into her ears and washed over her mind.&nbsp; The singing added to the dreamlike state that Asiara already felt, taking away any need for her own thoughts and guiding her where it willed.&nbsp; This time, Asiara made no effort to fight the controlling power of the song &#8211; she made no attempt to hear words in its syllables, or to make sense of its rhythm or melody.&nbsp; She simply obeyed.

Slowly, she walked through the forest &#8211; the grass quickly being replaced with the gentle crunch of old leaves.&nbsp; Before long, she had arrived at the lake, and there, ready to greet her, was the nymph, sitting in the middle of the water, resting on the surface as though it were as solid as the ground under Asiara&#8217;s bare feet.

And the water spirit was singing, providing the glorious sounds that continued to coax Asiara forward.&nbsp; Asiara didn&#8217;t break stride &#8211; she walked towards the water, peeling off her robe as she did so.&nbsp; As her feet entered the water, she felt an erotic thrill dripping through her body, and as she stepped deeper and deeper into the water, she could similarly feel herself falling deeper and deeper under the spell of the lovely song that had claimed her mind.

As she waded closer and closer to the nymph in the middle of the lake, the spirit stood and started to move towards her as well.&nbsp; Asiara stopped moving when she was in the water up to her waste.&nbsp; The nymph was standing before her, but, since she still stood on the surface of the water, she towered over Asiara&#8217;s naked body.&nbsp; The warrior woman looked up at the beautiful body standing over her, taking in its lovely curves and sensual, fluid beauty.

After a long pause in which Asiara felt herself submit to this enchanting creature&#8217;s power, the nymph stepped forward and draped one leg over Asiara&#8217;s shoulder.&nbsp; Asiara felt water sliding down her skin and dripping over her breasts.&nbsp; But more importantly, she gazed at the smooth, beautiful, perfect woman before her.&nbsp; Whether acting on instinct or on command Asiara didn&#8217;t know, but without hesitation she leaned forward and thrust her tongue into the moist feminine folds before her.

The sound of the music continued, but it seemed to raise ever so slightly in pitch &#8211; and intensity.&nbsp; This new timbre of sound urged Asiara on, and she focused all of her own need for pleasure and release into her pleasuring of this wondrous nymph.&nbsp; 

As her tongue worked over the soft, wet skin of the nymph, Asiara struggled to breath, as water seemed to cascade over her nose and mouth.&nbsp; But she didn&#8217;t relent.&nbsp; Gasping for air whenever she could manage, she channeled all of the erotic feelings and thoughts that had danced through her all day into the actions of her tongue, knowing that her own ecstasy would follow.

The more her tongue worked, the more intense the nymph&#8217;s song became and so, too, did the intensity of her watery secretions seem to increase.&nbsp; Asiara found breathing to be more and more difficult.&nbsp; As water flowed around her nose and mouth, she realized that she would drown soon if this continued so, in a last ditch effort to save herself, she pushed her tired tongue to work its magic with all the fervor she could muster.

The sound in Asiara&#8217;s ears seemed to settle into a long, enchanting note of pleasure as Asiara felt the nymph&#8217;s body tense, and then begin to quake.&nbsp; Still, Asiara didn&#8217;t let up, holding her breath, she licked and sucked as furiously and desperately as her tired mouth would allow.&nbsp; And then, finally, just as she was sure she could hold her breath no more, the nymph pulled back.

Asiara looked up to see the nymph&#8217;s blissful face, smiling even as she continued to sing her enchanting song, and felt her own arousal grow from the knowledge that she had succeeded in her ministrations.&nbsp; Pulling her leg off of Asiara&#8217;s shoulder, the nymph reached down and began to stroke her lover&#8217;s drenched hair, soothing Asiara with her cool, slick touch.

Then, the character of the nymph&#8217;s song changed.&nbsp; Though still complex and enchanting, it now became softer, more subdued.&nbsp; It reminded Asiara of a lullaby, relaxing and gentle.&nbsp; And, indeed, it was having the lullaby&#8217;s effect on her.&nbsp; As the soothing sounds caressed her ears and her mind, Asiara felt tension dissolve from her body.&nbsp; With the water swirling softly against her skin, she felt herself swaying slightly, and her eyes were becoming heavy.&nbsp; Arousal still ebbed through her body, but now fatigue was also influencing her, and the lovely song was lulling her to sleep.

It was more than Asiara could have resisted, even if she desired to disobey the nymph&#8217;s spells.&nbsp; Instead, she gave in to it, letting her eyes slowly flutter closed, and feeling the lake as it seemed to creep up her body.&nbsp; With a quiet, relaxed, and blissful sigh, Asiara let herself drift into sleep at the feet of the water nymph�

When she awoke, she found herself in a rather different situation.&nbsp; She was lying on a sandy embankment, beneath a large tree whose low lying branches and mossy leaves dipped into the water around her, forming a kind of natural bower.&nbsp; She was just at the edge of the lake, so that her legs were under water, and her upper torso was half submerged.&nbsp; Only her head was completely on dry land.

As her eyes fluttered open, she squinted in the moonlight as a small gap in the branches allowed the green orb of Neda to shine directly into her eyes.&nbsp; Turning away from the bright moon, Asiara looked around her, taking in the full erotic nature of her predicament.&nbsp; 

Lying on her back as she was, she tried to look down to see her naked body, lying half submerged in the cool water.&nbsp; Moving her head proved difficult, however, as she suddenly realized that her movement was extremely limited.&nbsp; The roots of the tree towering above her had wrapped themselves around her arms, holding them away from her body and pinning her upper body to the ground.&nbsp; Similar roots had claimed her legs, keeping her trapped in a spread-eagle position.&nbsp; Snaking down from the trunk of the tree was a thick vine that had wrapped itself around her neck, limiting her ability to move her head, and making any motions on her part dangerous, as it caused the root to tighten, cutting off her breathing.

Lying helpless in this position, Asiara felt her nipples, already hard as the cool air chilled her damp skin, begin to throb as the arousal that she had been building all day continued to churn within her.&nbsp; And beneath the water, the subtle currents of the lake were driving her already aroused sex wild with desire.&nbsp; 

Asiara struggled futilely to move, feeling the hard bark of the tree&#8217;s roots holding her in place.&nbsp; But her struggles weren&#8217;t aimed at escape &#8211; she was merely reinforcing in her own mind how helpless she was.&nbsp; The more aware she became that the tree had claimed her &#8211; had taken control of her body &#8211; the more incredibly turned on she became.&nbsp; She continued to pull and struggle, feeling her arousal grow all the while as she moaned desperately into the night air.

After several minutes of this, Asiara felt as though she had worked herself to a fever pitch.&nbsp; And then, a welcome and stunning sight arrived before her: the water nymph&#8217;s head emerged from the water between Asiara&#8217;s legs.&nbsp; Slowly, enticingly, the nymph&#8217;s features came to hover over Asiara&#8217;s prone form, with a wicked grin on her lips, and a glistening sparkle in her eye.

For quite some time she simply stared at Asiara, holding the trapped woman&#8217;s gaze.&nbsp; Then, she lowered her head slowly back into the water, stopping when only her eyes were still visible above the surface.&nbsp; Asiara was struggling to breath as she strained to look down towards the spirit&#8217;s lovely face.&nbsp; The cold green light of the moon was bright enough to penetrate the water &#8211; Asiara could see her own legs, straining against their wooden bonds; she could see her sex, so saturated with desire; she could see her hips, quivering as the water&#8217;s surface teased them.

But she couldn&#8217;t see the water nymph.&nbsp; It was as if she didn&#8217;t exist below the water &#8211; only the teasing eyes, and the top of the head, with its lovely silver hair, gave indication that the nymph even existed.

But if Asiara&#8217;s eyes struggled to verify the spirit&#8217;s position, her sense of touch had no such difficulties.&nbsp; Suddenly, Asiara felt firm, confident hands take hold of her own strong legs, gripping her inner thighs and causing Asiara to let out a long and lustful moan.&nbsp; Then, the eyes positioned themselves near her sex, which was just below the surface of the water.&nbsp; That was when Asiara felt the tongue begin to tease her, penetrating her feminine folds and causing new sensations of pleasure to ripple through her.

Desperate for the contact to continue, Asiara thrust her hips up, causing them to break the surface.&nbsp; As she did so, the water nymph&#8217;s head moved with them.&nbsp; For a brief instant, her entire face came into view, including the delicate, dexterous tongue that was driving Asiara&#8217;s need for climax.&nbsp; But then, with a powerful push, the water spirit forced Asiara&#8217;s lower torso back into the water, and, at the same time, her own form, other than the top of her head, which was still above the surface of the water, seemed to dissolve once again.

But the physical sensations in Asiara&#8217;s sex certainly did not stop.&nbsp; Losing control of her body, she tried to raise her hips once again, but suddenly found that that motion, like so many others, had been taken from her.&nbsp; A new vine had looped itself around her waist, trapping her body in its current position.&nbsp; She could do nothing to increase the pressure of the water nymph&#8217;s invisible, submerged tongue.&nbsp; All she could do was close her eyes and let the feelings wash over her, driving her closer and closer to climax, but always relenting right before she achieved release.

The water nymph seemed to know exactly how to stimulate her.&nbsp; Like waves in the ocean, she brought pleasure crashing down on Asiara&#8217;s body, only to then gently recede, eroding her self control but never quite submerging her in complete physical climax.&nbsp; Again, and again Asiara felt herself on the brink, but always, just as she braced herself for orgasm the tongue would ease up, leaving her desperate and frustrated.

Then, without warning, the vine around her neck tightened.&nbsp; Asiara heard her own moans slowly become choked off as the vine made it harder and harder to breath.&nbsp; At that same instant, the water spirit redoubled her attack on Asiara&#8217;s sex, licking hard at her most sensitive areas, and finally bringing her to the point of no return.

As her orgasm crashed over her body, Asiara felt the vine closing around her, making it impossible to take in a breath.&nbsp; Unable to moan, it was as if all of the erotic energy being released inside of her had no outlet, and her whole body began to shake and spasm as the erotic energy spilled over her sex and flooded every part of her being.

The spirit&#8217;s tongue caused climax after climax to cascade out of her, drowning her in pleasure and causing her to lose awareness of anything but her passionate ecstasy.&nbsp; She lost awareness of the vine around her throat; she lost awareness of her need for air; she lost awareness of her body&#8217;s bound state; she only knew of the pleasure that the water spirit was giving to her.

And then, as both the climax and the lack of air pushed her body beyond what it could take, she was aware of nothing�

For the second time in as many days, Asiara woke up in her own bed with no memory of how she got there.&nbsp; Her robe was draped over her shoulders, but it was lying wide open, completely exposing her naked breasts to the cool morning air.&nbsp; As with the day before, she felt a deep, satisfied feeling flowing over her, and smiled broadly as she ran her fingers through her dark curls.&nbsp; She didn�t know why she was enjoying these late night trysts with the water nymph so much � after all, she was accustomed to being the one in control � but something about how helpless she had felt made her wet just thinking about it.

Shaking her head to clear her thoughts, she sat up and looked around her to try to make sense of what time it was.&nbsp; From the sounds of bustle outside, and the brightness of the sun leaking through the gap between the tent and the ground she guessed that it must be close to midday.&nbsp; Flopping back on her bed, her hand strayed to her sex, where she started to gently stroke and tease herself as she let her mind wander.&nbsp; She knew she should get up and go talk to Partheon, who must be fuming by now, but somehow she couldn�t find the motivation.&nbsp; All that mattered to her right now was reliving the previous night and preparing herself for whatever this eve would bring.

After about an hour or so of this, though, she was given no choice.&nbsp; She heard a gruff voice outside of her tent.

�Damn it, Asiara, we need to consult.&nbsp; If you don�t come out here soon I�m going to assume that something�s wrong, and I�m going to come into your tent.&nbsp; I�ll wait thirty seconds.�

Sighing, Asiara slipped out of bed and tied her robe around her.&nbsp; As she stepped out of her tent, squinting in the bright sunlight, she saw her second in command staring at her, his fate beet red with anger and frustration.

�Asiara, we need to get moving.&nbsp; Our scouts have reported that the Maurial army is in the area.&nbsp; If they find us in disarray like this, they�ll make short work of us.�

With a far off look in her eye, Asiara hummed calmly before replying, �We have to stay.&nbsp; I�m not going anywhere.�

�Pardon me for saying this, Asiara, but what the hell is the matter with you?&nbsp; I�ve heard the reports of you slipping off in the night, then somehow reappearing unconscious on the edge of camp without anyone seeing you arrive.&nbsp; Whatever�s going on has to stop!&nbsp; You�re going to get us all killed!�

�I have been leaving for reasons that are my own.&nbsp; That is all you need to know.&nbsp; That, and that we are staying here for now.�

As Asiara said this, the thought of another evening with the water nymph flitted through her mind, and a blissful smile spread across her face.&nbsp; Partheon looked at her with a sincere and chastising glare.

�Listen, Asiara, we all know about your sexual appetites.&nbsp; Let�s face it, a few of our men have experienced it firsthand.&nbsp; But throughout this campaign you�ve never let it interfere with your duties to your soldiers.&nbsp; Or to your Queen.�

At that last comment, Asiara�s eyes flared for a moment.&nbsp; He was right, she was betraying her Queen�s orders by not moving.&nbsp; For a moment, she felt slightly dizzy as the full import of that realization hit her.&nbsp; She had served the Queen faithfully for so long � ever since� the exact amount of time was irrelevant.&nbsp; She had to obey her Queen�s orders.

But the water nymph made her feel so good.&nbsp; Perhaps she could stay for one more night.&nbsp; After all, this day was half over already anyway.&nbsp; With the image of her Queen�s palace in her mind, Asiara made a decision.

�Tell the men to make preparations today for an early departure.&nbsp; We�ll leave first thing in the morning.�

�Asiara, why not move today � tonight.&nbsp; We�ve been here too long!�

Upon hearing Partheon say the word �night� she couldn�t help but think of the lake, and what she would experience there.&nbsp; A distant, blissful look spread over her face.&nbsp; Quietly, she said, �Tomorrow.&nbsp; First thing in the morning.�

Partheon looked at her in frustration, but seemed to know that she wouldn�t change her mind.&nbsp; He started to stalk away, his armor clanking as he took quick, angered steps.&nbsp; After he had walked a short way, he turned back towards Asiara.

�He or she had better be good to be worth the risk you�re taking with all of our lives.&nbsp; And for god�s sake, take your swords with you this time.&nbsp; Not even your new abilities can save you if you�re unarmed.�

With that, he turned and walked away, shaking his head.

Asiara felt a wave of dizziness again as Partheon�s reaction forced her to think about the Annol army, and her duty to her Queen.&nbsp; But the pleasure she had felt these past two nights was simply too much to ignore.&nbsp; The Maurial army was probably only in the area because it was the easiest way to travel � that was why she had chosen to come this way in the first place.&nbsp; And they would have no reason to take the detour that had led Asiara�s forces to their current encampment.&nbsp; Her army would leave tomorrow, and all would be well.

And in the meantime, Asiara would prepare herself for whatever the night had in store.&nbsp; Returning to her tent, she slipped off her robe, laid back down upon her bed, and began stroking and teasing herself, getting her body ready for another night of unthinkable pleasure.

It seemed that days had passed before the sun finally disappeared from the sky.&nbsp; Asiara waited until the moon had risen high into the night air before slipping from her tent.&nbsp; She had taken a few steps before she realized that she was completely naked and weaponless.&nbsp; As eager as she was to return to the lake in the forest, she remembered Partheon�s plea.&nbsp; Returning to her tent, she draped her robe around her shoulders and grabbed her thick leather belt � the one with her two swords strapped to it.&nbsp; After buckling this around her waist, she set out once again.

For the first time, though, she didn�t walk boldly out of the camp, but instead waited for some clouds to douse the moonlight before slipping away under the cover of shadow.&nbsp; She was the Captain, and could do as she pleased, but her encounter with Partheon had made it clear to her that her troops were beginning to ask questions.&nbsp; She didn�t want to fuel their fire any more than she had to.

Her own fire, however, was burning quite hot, and as she got far enough away from the camp that she didn�t need to worry about any of the lookouts spotting her she broke into an almost frantic run, she was so eager to encounter the water nymph again.

Before long she was back in the forest, and almost immediately she heard the song that had conquered her will two nights ago.&nbsp; No longer running, she let herself move as quickly or as slowly as the song demanded, slipping through the trees towards her inevitable destination.&nbsp; As she stepped into the clearing, she saw the water nymph lying on her side in the middle of the lake; relaxing on the surface of the water as if it were a sheet of strong glass.

The nymph was also singing, and her voice penetrated Asiara�s mind, calming her even as it seemed to stroke her dripping wet sex.&nbsp; Asiara stepped to the edge of the pool, and then stopped, waiting for the command in the melody that would coax her into the water, or drop her into an enchanted sleep.&nbsp; Asiara didn�t care which one it was, she only wanted to experience whatever the nymph had planned for her.

As the song continued to float into her mind, Asiara felt a sudden compulsion to remove her weapon belt, and then to shrug off her robe, leaving both lying just at the water�s edge.&nbsp; Then, the water nymph stood in a smooth, fluid motion before walking gracefully towards Asiara.&nbsp; When she was standing at the very edge of the pool, her feet still resting on the water just before it met the land, she reached for Asiara, placing her hands on either side of Asiara�s head, cupping her face gently; tenderly.&nbsp; 

Still singing softly, she stepped back, pulling Asiara slowly into the water.&nbsp; The warrior woman felt the lake close around her ankles, but she didn�t look down.&nbsp; Instead, she stared into the eyes of the beautiful nymph before her, letting their cold, blue brilliance capture her gaze even as the song continued to capture her mind.

Another step drew her slightly deeper, and as the cool water washed over her calf, Asiara heard another sound start to blend with the music that engulfed her: her own sighs and moans were now filling the air as her arousal continued to boil within her.&nbsp; The need for release had grown so intense that she was struggling to keep her balance as the nymph took another step back, and then another.

Before she knew it, Asiara was in the pool up to her waist, and still the nymph cupped her head in her hands, and stared deeply into her eyes.&nbsp; And all the while the lilting, magical melody played over Asiara�s thoughts, controlling her and guiding her forward, and spurring on her need for climax with every enchanting note.&nbsp; She could feel the tightness in her nipples, and the arousal humming through them in time with the song; her sex quivered in perfect harmony with the singing that claimed her.

Through all of this, Asiara suddenly managed a single, surprised thought: the nymph�s eyes were still level with her own.&nbsp; Through her flickering awareness, she realized that the nymph was in the pool up to her waist as well and, like the previous night, the parts of her that were underwater were nowhere to be seen.

But they were still to be felt.&nbsp; With a commanding tug, the water nymph drew Asiara�s body against her own, pressing her thigh against Asiara�s sex and pulling their bodies together.&nbsp; The nymph�s mouth sought out Asiara�s, swallowing the gasp of surprise and pleasure that escaped the helpless woman�s mouth.&nbsp; Asiara struggled to breathe as the nymph�s wet tongue explored her mouth, but her thoughts were only on one thing � the explosive pleasure that was rippling out of her sex and through her entire body.&nbsp; Losing control of herself, she began to rub her hungry sex against the watery thigh of the nymph, feeling it drive her higher and higher into her lustful haze.&nbsp; The song had ended with the nymph�s kiss, but Asiara was still completely under her control, as her sex would not allow her to disobey the creature that was bringing her so much pleasure.

Eventually, the nymph broke the kiss, leaving Asiara gasping for breath even as she was pulled several steps further into the water.&nbsp; She could feel it lapping at the undersides of her breasts, and could see the water nymph�s body continue to seemingly dissolve into the lake.&nbsp; Asiara could still see the nymph�s beautiful breasts, but below them, the glinting green moonlight revealed nothing but pure, clear water.

Asiara�s skin, however, was aware of so much more, as the nymph�s invisible arms wrapped around her waist, pulling her close and pressing their hips against each other.&nbsp; Above the water, their breasts were now crushed together, and Asiara could feel her tight nipples being teased by the water nymph�s own.&nbsp; Panting her own intense arousal, Asiara wanted nothing more than to let go, to let the climax wash over her, and to relax her muscles � to float in orgasmic bliss on the lake�s surface as her body quivered in the moonlight.

But still, she remained standing, waiting for the water nymph�s direction to guide her to her ultimate pleasure.&nbsp; With another few backwards steps, the nymph took Asiara still deeper, bringing her into the lake up to her neck.&nbsp; Though only the nymph�s head remained visible, Asiara could still feel the creature�s lovely breasts pressed against her own, and could still feel the water nymph�s body stimulating her desperate sex.&nbsp; Almost totally submerged in the water, Asiara was now becoming aware of stimulation elsewhere on her body, as well.&nbsp; It was as if thousands of tiny currents of water were swirling frantically around her, teasing and exciting every nerve in her body.&nbsp; Screaming in arousal, Asiara reveled in the sensation, submerging herself completely in the feelings that permeated her.

Then, without warning, the water nymph surprised Asiara yet again.&nbsp; Asiara felt the nymph�s arms wrap around her back, gripping her at the shoulder and, with this leverage, the nymph lifted herself slightly before wrapping her legs around Asiara, trapping her invisible body against Asiara�s.&nbsp; Asiara expected to be dragged down with the extra weight, but she could feel almost nothing pulling on her � the nymph�s skin stimulated her, but her weight was inconsequential even as she began to writhe against Asiara, sending her still higher into her lustful frenzy.

Wrapped around Asiara as she was, the water nymph was no longer pulling Asiara further into the pool.&nbsp; Instead, she was grinding her body into the impossibly aroused woman�s own � building her desire for climax while teasingly refusing to push her over the final edge.

Asiara was overcome with lust.&nbsp; She could feel the sandy bottom of the lake below her feet, but how she managed to keep her footing was beyond her, as every muscle in her body was shaking with desire and arousal.&nbsp; Everywhere that the nymph�s body was pressed against hers she felt torrents of pleasure cascading upon her senses, and everywhere that was still exposed was saturated in the sensation that this magical water imparted.

Then, Asiara was pushed to her very limit.&nbsp; Her eager, hungry sex had grown so desperate that its walls separated, allowing a substantial amount of water to rush inside of her, filling her most intimate places.&nbsp; And as it did so, a million minute but powerful jets of water danced against the lining of her feminine channel, eroding the last bits of her will.&nbsp; In a fit of need, Asiara knew what she must do.&nbsp; Of her own volition, she stepped forward, taking herself further into the pool, taking herself deeper into its waters even as she sank deeper into her arousal.

The water moved up her neck, over her jaw and chin.&nbsp; It passed her cheeks and nose, engulfing her eyes and eventually wetting even the uppermost curls of her dark hair.&nbsp; As the water closed over Asiara�s head, she felt her arousal, already so intense, spike to an all new level, holding her on the edge of an explosive, spirit altering climax for just a moment.

Then, that climax arrived.&nbsp; With the water nymph�s completely naked body still writhing against her, and with the overwhelming stimulation of her skin and sex pushing her beyond what she knew was possible, Asiara climaxed so powerfully, so completely, that the thought of fighting for breath, or even of holding her breath was incapable of entering her pleasure filled mind.&nbsp; Without even knowing that she did so, Asiara opened her lungs and breathed deeply as the climax tore through her, but all that entered was clear, erotic water.

But the sensation only added to what Asiara was feeling.&nbsp; Rather than feeling as though she were drowning, she felt a sudden sensation of ultimate freedom, as pleasure seemed to occupy every part of her body and soul.&nbsp; The water in her lungs wasn�t robbing her of life, it was permeating her; changing her.&nbsp; And as it did so, the pleasure altered her even more.&nbsp; The waves of orgasmic bliss were so powerful, so torrential, that they seemed to be tearing her apart.&nbsp; Asiara felt the pleasure pulling her in a million different directions, exploding her spirit and dissolving her being at the same time.&nbsp; She lost herself in otherworldly nirvana as the writhing body on top of her seemed to dissipate, to move into her, to become one with her.

Asiara�s consciousness was fading even as her awareness of pleasure grew.&nbsp; The climax became her single thought, her single state of existence.&nbsp; Her body and her mind were dissolving into that climax, making her one with the pleasure, and making her one with the lake.&nbsp; Asiara could feel her independence eroding, she could feel herself � her soul � blending with the lake and the nymph that inhabited it.

But then, an odd vibration � more of a chant than a song � seemed to hum through the water; through her own body, which was quickly becoming indistinguishable from the water.&nbsp; As the sexual release continued to cloud every part of Asiara�s thoughts and awareness, she suddenly felt the water in her lungs, she suddenly felt the presence of the nymph, and then, just as suddenly, she felt nothing as a deep and impenetrable darkness descended on her, and that was all that she knew�
