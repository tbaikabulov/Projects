Carmenica   
Part 1   
I
    think this was the 575  th   audition
    I had attended since I moved to London three and a half years ago. At least
    it felt like it. To say I had been an overwhelming failure in launching my
    acting career was being kind.   
I
    had always wanted to be an actor. Of course, I had used the drama studies
    as a way to escape the constant teasing from the boys at school, the jokes
    and the terrible stunts they used to pull on me.   
Thankfully,
    I was sent to a co-educational school and I thought the pranks and the teasing
    would finish but I was wrong. In fact, it became worse. Some of the girls
    used to egg the boys on and make cruel comments themselves while offering
    me lipstick.   
Like
    a lot of children, I used comedy and humour to try to make friends. I used
    to mimic teachers, I could get their voices down perfectly but that soon
    wore thin and my fellow pupils were soon back at throwing stuff at me, calling
    me 'Marylyn' which was pretty stupid as I had dark hair but I think you get
    the point. Every day there would be a move against me, such as suddenly picking
    me and dropping me in the garbage bins. God, I hated that!   
I
    was a loner right through to university and I tried out for many roles there
    but was rejected for every one I attempted to win.   
There
    was one role I thought I had, though. Jeremy was directing and he encouraged
    me, asked me to work through the lines with him and then he tried to kiss
    me. After that, I decided to pack university in, travel down to London and
    become a real actor.   
There
    was no doubt in my mine that I was a capable actor, in fact, in my private
    moments, I daydreamed I had the potential to be a great actor. Unfortunately,
    directors, producers, casting agencies and theatrical agents all disagreed
    with me.   
'You
    have excellent skills, my boy,' Martin Handley, the famous theatrical director
    said one day when he was in an expansive mood after rejecting me once again.
    'Great skills, of that there is no doubt. Unfortunately,' he said with a
    gesture at my appearance, 'you don't have  it  ,
    you don't have a presence.'   
I
    sighed, I had heard it many times before, perhaps not as kindly put as Handley
    had said it but heard it I had, over and over again. I didn't have  it  ,
    the indefinable thing that automatically draws the eyes of the audience to
    the actor. Some call  it   charisma;
    others just call the mysterious ingredient  it  .
    Whatever it is, I didn't have it!   
It
    appeared that no one could see me as leading man material and I also didn't
    have enough other qualities to be an outstanding character actor. I used
    to stare at my face and wondered why did I have to take after my mother and
    not after my father? I had her eyes, cheekbones and hair as well as her build.
    My father had wished I had taken more after him; he had the height, build
    and determination &ndash; everything I appeared to lack.   
'Christopher,'
    Martin soothed, 'you have an excellent voice, an extraordinary ear for accents,
    why not radio plays? You'd be an enormous success.'   
I
    did one or two radio plays but there weren't enough to keep a person fed
    and watered in an expensive city like London and, of course, there was the
    question of working in real theatre. I'm not a snob or I don't think I am
    but I wanted to work in real theatre, in the West End or, dare I dream, Broadway?   
So,
    I was a sucker and kept coming back for more. I wasn't ready to give up on
    my dream just yet. The audition for  Silken
    Memories   was being held
    in a small workshop theatre in south London, hidden away from the hustle
    and bustle and I lined up with the other actors.   
Sarah
    Wright wrote the play and that guaranteed an instant success but the material
    was excellent as well and really tore at my heart. The strong lead was the
    female, a woman who goes from rags to riches while enduring emotional pain
    along the way but I was auditioning for the role of Tom, the husband who
    deserts her and then faces his own retribution as she blossoms.   
Lucy
    Richards waved at me, really just wriggled her fingers as she passed and
    I nodded. I had given up trying to persuade her to represent me, she was
    the best agent in London but she was very selective.   
'Christopher,
    I'm sorry,' she said after I had bothered her for the tenth time, 'I can't
    represent you, you don't have the qualities.' Lucy was a hard woman and spoke
    frankly. 'Take a look in the mirror, you will never be a leading man, you're
    too pretty.'   
'Jude
    Law is pretty,' I said defensively but she just shook his head.   
'Jude
    is masculine and he is a spectacularly handsome male. Chris, you are pretty.
    Why don't you get Mark to teach you and go on the cabaret circuit? I'll represent
    you if you want to go into his act but you are really too pretty for a man.'
    She let the words sink in before she squeezed my arm and said, 'I'm sorry,'
    before walking away.   
At
    least she didn't mention my height. I had been rejected many times because
    I wasn't tall enough. It's a cattle call and we all go through it but I wonder
    if the directors even care about the feelings of the actors? In my case,
    I knew they didn't.   
The
    director of  Silken Memories   was
    Richard Hawkins, a director whose work I admired but personally could not
    stand. He exhibited all of the bad qualities of a Cambridge graduate and
    none of the good.   
He
    was talking to Henri Profert, the producer when I sidled onto the stage to
    read. 'The roles of Tom, David and the others will be easy to fill but I
    am concerned we haven't got our Simone.'   
'We
    will find her,' Henri soothed. 'It is a difficult role. Ah,' he said with
    a smile, 'here's Sarah at last.' Sarah Wright stepped onto the stage and
    sat on the vacant chair next to Richard.   
'Simone
    has to be perfect,' was all she said before rifling through the script. Sarah
    Wright was such a famous playwright; everyone knew she had the power of veto
    on any actor selection.   
I
    cleared my throat and Richard nodded as his assistant whispered in his ear.   
'Christopher
    Redden,' I announced. 'I'm reading the final scene between Tom and Simone.'
    They nodded and I began. I was just getting to the crucial part when Richard
    waved and said, 'Thank you, next.'   
Sarah
    watched me as I slowly walked from the stage. A tall handsome man bounded
    past me. 'Wade Thompson,' he announced and began to read the same part I
    had just attempted to perform.   
'Wait,'
    Richard called and I turned around. 'You,' he said pointing at me. 'What's
    your name?'   
'Christopher
    Redden,' I murmured, brushing my hair from my eyes.   
'Can
    you read the Simone part so we can get an idea of how Wade would go, get
    a real feel for the scene?'   
I
    almost told him to get stuffed when Sarah said, 'You seem to understand what
    lies behind the words.' Her voice was quiet and she smiled wryly.   
'Ok,'
    I said and waited for Wade to begin.   
It
    was a great part and I loved it.   
Tom: I don't
  think you understand my difficulties, Simone.  
Simone ( sharply  ):
  Don't you Tom? I think I've had enough difficulties of my own, I think I've
  had experience! Don't you? Don't you Tom?  
Tom: Simone,
  don't&hellip;  
Simone ( anguished  ):
  Don't what Tom? Don't embarrass you, or is it you don't want to remind you?
  Remind you of what you've done, done to me?  
'Thank
    you,' Richard called. 'That was excellent, Wade. Are you still represented
    by the formidable Lucy Richards?'   
Wade
    nodded with a big grin and I walked slowly off the stage, feeling sick.   
'Mr
    Redden, wait.' I turned around hopefully but saw it was Sarah Wright walking
    quickly across the stage. Richard was deep in conversation with Henri and
    Wade was talking to Lucy.   
'Yes?'
    I waited politely.   
'I
    just wanted to tell you that you conveyed so much in those lines, you seem
    to know the play?' She cocked her head and looked me up and down.   
'It's
    brilliant,' I said simply. 'I think the play is your best and the part of
    Simone is superb. A real challenge to any actor.'   
'Thank
    you but that is also the problem for us. I'm afraid I'm insisting on an unknown,
    I want Simone to really speak and not be subdued because of the fame of the
    performer.'   
'I
    understand completely. Good luck.' I began to turn away but her next words
    held me.   
'This
    play is important to me,' Sarah said. 'Really important and luck is what
    we need, I think.' She laughed a little harshly. 'I think we have just five
    weeks to find Simone. Otherwise they,' she said with a jerk of her head back
    at Richard and Henri, 'will insist on Emma Thompson or someone. I've nothing
    against Emma but she's not Simone.'   
'No,'
    I agreed   
'But  you   were
    in just those few lines. Thank you, Mr Redden, you've given me hope that
    Simone is out there somewhere, we just have to find her.'   
I
    walked out and bumped into Wade and Lucy in the lane where they were waiting
    for their taxi. 'Chris,' Lucy said with a smile. 'Thanks for helping out
    in there, Wade got the part.'   
He
      got the role on ten words  ?
      With a sick feeling in my stomach, I realised he got it solely on the way
      he looked. Granted, he was tall and handsome but I didn't think he could
      act that well. To be fair, I hadn't seen much but it had been enough for
      Hawkins to pick him.   
'Congratulations,
    Wade,' I said woodenly, trying to push past.   
'Thanks,
    old man,' he said, slapping me on the back and I half fell to the ground.   
Lucy
    helped me to my feet as Wade walked to the end of the lane to search for
    the taxi. 'You were great,' Lucy said as she helped me up. 'How do you get
    so much feeling, so much emotion in those few words?'   
'I'm
    an actor,' I said stiffly.   
She
    adjusted my coat. 'Have you thought about sprucing yourself up a bit, getting
    a haircut or something?'   
'I'm
    trying to get rid of my  prettiness!'   
'You
    still mad at that? I'm sorry but it's the truth. Sometimes I think you'd
    make a better girl then half the female actors around.'   
'Thanks
    a lot,' I said grumpily, walking off.   
'You
    just look scruffy, Chris,' she called after me. 'Get a haircut and stop with
    the beard thing! Three wispy hairs on your chin don't make a beard!'   
'Get
    stuffed!' I muttered walking towards the tube station.   
I
    wandered the streets, my head reeling with the injustice of it all. It was
    so unfair, so fucking unfair!   
That's
    what I told Mark after another wine. We were in his flat and he had listened
    patiently to me for over an hour. Mark was, I guess my best friend, if not
    my only friend which is telling as we weren't that close. We attended a method
    acting class together for a while until he proclaimed  it
    was boring crap, darling,   and
    left.   
I
    bumped into him one afternoon and we had a coffee. I found out that Mark
    was a female impersonator in one of those posh shows that toured the West
    End and other places. He had even been to Las Vegas and New York and was
    represented by Lucy Richards so he must be making squillions!   
'What
    about real acting?' I asked self-righteously and his eyes narrowed.   
'Who
    said this isn't real? Let me tell you, my dear,' he said with a smile, 'the
    pay check is very real, very real indeed.' I could see that was the truth
    by the opulence of his his flat.   
'It's
    fucking unfair,' I moaned again.   
'For
    God's sake, dear,' Mark said with rolling eyes, 'will you leave it alone?'
    He poured himself another glass of champagne. 'It's not meant to be.'   
'Mark,'
    I said miserably, tipping the empty bottle into my glass for the last remaining
    drops of wine. 'What am I going to do?'   
'Give
    up the acting rubbish, dear, and join me,' he said sipping his champagne
    again.   
'You?'
    I was flustered. 'As a female imp&hellip;'   
'Exactly.'
    He winked dramatically. 'You'd be positively gorgeous with those eyes and
    cheekbones. You'd knock them dead.'   
'Lucy
    told me to work with you but&hellip;'   
'But
    nothing my boy.' He pulled me to my feet and to the mirror. 'Look at your
    eyes, I'm so jealous.' He pulled my hair away from my face. 'You'd be beautiful.'   
Irritably,
    I pulled away. 'I'm tired of people saying I'm pretty.'   
'You'd
    be a beautiful woman, Chrissie,' he said with a smile, calmly sipping his
    champagne.   
'Stop
    calling me Chrissie. Pity I'm not a woman,' I said as I sunk into the sofa.
    'I'd get the part of Simone if I was, I just know it.'   
'So
    be a woman,' Mark said with an airy wave.   
'What?'
    I looked up and I think we both thought the same thing at the exact same
    time. 'You mean go to the audition as a woman? Do the  Tootsie   thing?'   
'I
    think you'd look a little better than Dustin Hoffman, Chrissie,' Mark said
    with a wink. 'I don't think he's got your legs.'   
'Be
    a woman?'   
'Why
    not? I do it two shows a night, five nights a week.'   
'But&hellip;'   
'But
    what? I could teach you a few things, help you. Anything,' he said with a
    roll of his eyes, 'to stop you constantly whining about how unfair everything
    is. God, I thought I was the drama queen!'   
I
    thought about it, really thought about it and then dismissed it. 'I'd look
    ridiculous.'   
'I
    don't think so.'   
'It'd
    be obvious that I was a man.'   
'Oh
    for heavens sake! Why don't we see?' His eyes were twinkling and he poured
    more champagne.   
'You
    mean?'   
'Why
    not, I have all the gear. It'll be fun. And it'll stop you wallowing. Are
    you game?'   
I
    thought for a moment and then shrugged. 'Ok, let's try it.'   
Looking
    back, I could see we didn't put much effort into it or so I thought. Mark
    made me up, crammed a wig on my head and I stared miserably at the mirror.   
'No,'
    Mark said slowly, lips pursed for a moment as he thought. 'It's not there.
    I'm afraid I'm useless at doing some one else's face and I only do make up
    for the stage. I know,' he said pointing at me, 'we need a stylist!'   
'Mark,'
    I said weakly, taking the blonde Marylyn Monroe wig off and throwing it onto
    the dressing table, 'this is not going to work.'   
'Hush!
    We're not giving up after one setback!'   
"We?'  When
      did it become we  , I thought,  when
      did I lose control  ?   
'You
    know Belinda Morrison, don't you?'   
'Belinda?
    Yes, of course I know of her, I met her once.' She'd been the stylist to
    several big names and then she wanted to begin her own business. They actors
    she had worked with for so long had promised to follow her but, of course
    they didn't. Last I heard, she had a beauty school at Notting Hill and was
    a little bitter about actors.   
'She's
    a good friend of mine.' Mark picked the phone up, thumbed through his big
    address book and punched in a number. Mark was a big man, over six foot which
    gave his act an extra element of comedy as he was obviously a man but performing
    so well as a woman. The exaggerated winks, pouts and wriggles always brought
    peals of laughter from the audience.   
'Belinda?
    How are you darling, it's Mark?' He listened for a moment and then turned
    to me. 'Go into the bathroom and get rid of that face,' he said with a smile
    and I took the hint.   
When
    I came back, he was waiting with his coat on, a bag over his shoulder and
    a grin over his face. 'It's off to Notting Hill. A horse, a horse a dildo
    for a horse,' he chanted, bustling out the door. He paused at the doorway.
    'Well, are you coming?'   
'But
    Mark&hellip;'   
'For
    goodness sake, have a big of dare in you, please! It's a bit of fun, that's
    all.'   
We
    bundled out of the taxi at Notting Hill and Mark led the way into the building
    where Belinda's school was. It occurred to me he seemed to have this arranged
    this all so quickly but that was typical of Mark. He had spontaneously decided
    to get a tattoo after seeing a lead singer of a boy band with one. Nothing
    wrong with that except he flew to New York to get it from the same tattooist
    that the singer had used.   
Mark
    and Belinda kissed and then Belinda stepped back, staring at me, eyes running
    over me. 'It's Christopher, isn't it? I think we've met before?' She was
    really examining me and I felt as if I was under some sort of professional
    scrutiny.   
Most
    women never remembered me but I remembered her. Belinda was tall and thin,
    hair dark and cut short with at least three hoop ear rings in each ear lobe.   
'Yes,
    that's right.'   
'So,
    you want to fool Richard Hawkins? And that little prick Henri Profert?'   
I
    looked at Mark who winked. 'I guess so,' I said weakly.   
'You
    guess?' Belinda asked sharply.   
'I'm
    sure, I want to win the audition.'   
She
    nodded, all business like. 'Ok, this will take a while,' she said, looking
    at us both. 'We have to be serious here to see if it'll work.'   
'We
    have all night, o dark one,' Mark said with an exaggerated bow and a smile.   
Belinda
    rolled her eyes, muttered something about queens and focussed back on me.
    'Last chance Chris, are you committed to this or has our camp friend persuaded
    you against your better nature?'   
I
    thought back at all the rejections I had endured, the times I had been dismissed
    without even a word, just a wave and those dreaded words,  Thank
    you. Next  !   
I
    wanted to do something different, my life was grey and horrible. The only
    friend I had was Mark, I had no girlfriends, my parents were dead and I had
    no other living relatives. With a blinding stab of reality, I knew I was
    lonely and miserable, a failure.   
'He
    hasn't persuaded me,' I said softly and Mark looked at me quietly with a
    small smile and a nod. 'I want to do this.'   
'Really?
    It won't be easy, you know,' she added warningly.   
'Let's
    do it,' I said, more bravely than I felt.   
Belinda
    led us in and I had a shower and then under her and Mark's instructions I
    removed all my body hair. I was initially embarrassed by Belinda's presence
    but she brusquely dismissed it. 'Forget it, Chris,' she said, 'try to think
    like a girl,' Belinda said with a wink and Mark giggled.   
'God
    knows I do,' Mark said with an exaggerated pout.   
Belinda
    disappeared to make some coffee so she said while Mark introduced me to the
    gaff. "This keeps Mr Happy well and truly hidden,' he explained as I blushingly
    put it on. I couldn't live without it,' he said dramatically and I suppressed
    a giggle.   
Then
    came the corset. It was excruciating but Belinda and Mark showed no mercy.
    I could hardly breathe as I sat in the chair so Belinda could shampoo, cut
    and style my hair. 'I'm using hair extensions so we can get them out later
    if this doesn't work,' she muttered, working away.   
Time
    merged into an endless void, I just flowed along, getting up when she said,
    moving to a new position and just being a piece of plasticine for her to
    mould. I was so numb I didn't blink an eye at the two large blobs of skin
    coloured plastic she thrust into the bra cups of the corset. Blankly I stared
    down as she arranged the breasts,  my
    breasts!   'If this works,
    we'll get the ones that glue.' She glanced at Mark. 'Didn't you have any
    smaller?'   
He
    shrugged. 'I'm a big boy, dear and now she's a big girl.' He winked at but
    I continued to sit in a daze, waiting for what she was going to do next.   
 Mark
    drank champagne, he forced a glass on both Belinda and I and he twirled around
    and around to music while Belinda patiently worked.   
She
    worked on my hair, my eyebrows and my make up including eyelashes. Finally,
    I slipped into the black dress Mark had magically produced from his bag along
    with the pair of shoes that, also magically, fit me. I had struggled to put
    pantyhose on but had avoided ladders and I stood in the centre of the room
    as Belinda teased my hair out of the rollers and fixed it. Clip on earrings,
    a necklace and perfume.   
Mark
    stopped dancing around and stood stock still, staring as Belinda stepped
    back.   
I
    stood there nervously, tasting the lipstick on my lips, breathing in shallow
    breaths because of the stupid corset and waited. They were both open mouthed
    and staring and glumly, I knew I must look stupid.   
'At
    least,' I said, blinking, 'I tried.'  What
    now  , I wondered,  what
    do I do now that this was a failure?   I
    then realised just how much I had hoped this would work.   
'Did
    you see that?' Belinda asked Mark softly and he just nodded.   
Belinda
    walked slowly around me, hand to her chin as she studied me. 'It was a rush
    job, there's so much more to do but&hellip;shit!' It was said softly and
    I turned to her, puzzled.   
'I
    know,' Mark breathed. 'It's amazing. I mean, I always suspected but to see
    it. That's why I planned this, got the shoes&hellip;' He suddenly looked
    at me.   
'What
    are you two going on about?'   
'Can
    you try a girls voice?' Belinda asked.   
I
    did have a good ear for accents and I closed my eyes as I remembered. After
    clearing my throat, eyes still closed, I softened my voice and made it higher,
    speaking from the throat and not the chest. 'How does this sound?' I asked
    and then opened my eyes. They were staring again. 'Do I sound acceptable?'
    I asked shyly.   
Belinda
    cleared her throat. 'Yes,' she said strangely, glancing at Mark, 'perfectly
    acceptable.'   
I
    saw the looks and stood with my hands on my hips. 'Will you two tell me what
    is going on, please?' Their eyes bulged and then Mark smirked while Belinda
    stifled a giggle.   
'Oh,'
    Mark screamed, 'she's a natural.'   
Belinda
    and Mark each took one of my arms and steered me to the mirror where I could
    see. 'Oh my god!' I exclaimed and the gorgeous woman in the mirror look shocked
    as well. She was beautiful. Dark hair to the shoulders, big wide violet eyes
    that beguiled, high elegant cheekbones and full red lips. I couldn't help
    myself, I smiled and the woman in the mirror smiled back, eyes twinkling.   
I
    stepped back and inspected myself, the figure was curvy, compliments of the
    padding, the largish fake breasts and the corset.   
'That's
    me,' I said in wonder, turning and inspecting myself. 'Is it really me?'
    I kept the female voice as it seemed appropriate somehow.   
'Yes,'
    Belinda said gruffly. 'It's you.' She shook her head. 'I don't believe it,
    but it's you.'   
'Could
    I get away with it?' We all knew what I meant. Could I get away with appearing
    at the audition, could I persuade them I was a woman? Suddenly, it all seemed
    possible to me.   
Mark
    shook his head. 'No,' he said quietly.   
'What?"   
'No,
    dear,' he said, resting his hand on my shoulder. 'It takes more than dress
    ups.'   
'Oh,'
    I said, head bowed, blinking.   
'Stop
    that,' Belinda said grumpily.   
'What?'   
'You
    know dam well. The pouting, sad face thing.'   
'Now,
    Belinda,' Mark said gently. 'She's a natural, that's all. She doesn't know.'   
'You've
    never done this before?' Belinda asked me suspiciously and I shook my head.   
'No,
    never.'   
'Never?'
    She looked at Mark.   
'Never,
    dear, I've tried to talk her into it many times but she wouldn't listen.
    You can see she's a natural.'   
Belinda
    studied me. 'She could pass, it would take a little work but she could. How
    long do we have?'   
'I
    think Chris said Sarah believed she had five weeks to find some one?' Mark
    looked at me and I nodded, still staring at myself in the mirror.   
'Five
    weeks, that will have to do then.'   
'If
    that,' Mark said, 'time is getting away'.   
'They'll
    find someone by then,' I said miserably.   
'Not
    if Lucy Richards calls them and tells them she has an outstanding person
    who is out of the country and will be back in four weeks.' Mark said it with
    glee and I looked at him, shocked.   
'Would
    Lucy do that?'   
Mark
    winked. 'Leave it to me.'   
'Do
    you want to do it, Chris?' Belinda asked quietly. 'Give everything up for
    four weeks?'   
'Give
    what up?' Mark said cattily as he sipped champagne. 'Eating junk food, reading
    scripts and getting rejected at auditions?'   
'I
    don't know,' I said quietly.   
Mark
    suddenly became serious and squatted down so he could look me directly in
    the eyes. 'Look, Chris,' he said with real affection, 'look in the mirror,
    that's you. You have a chance here to do everything you've ever wanted, to
    walk a West End stage, to read the reviews to experience it all. It's what
    you wanted, isn't it?'   
"Yes,'
    I whispered and the woman in the mirror also whispered yes.   
'You
    only have to do it once, just once and then you can let the world, all those
    arseholes know that you not only acted brilliantly as Simone you acted as
    a woman acting Simone.'   
My
    eyes bulged at that and the woman in the mirror looked pretty excited. 'You
    think?'   
'Chris,'
    Mark said softly, turning my face away from the mirror. 'I know what I am.
    I dress up in frocks and mime  Dancing
    Queen   and I love it. But
    it's obvious I'm not a woman, that's my whole act but you, can't you see
    how stunning you are? I mean, dear Kylie Minogue would be jealous! Seriously,
    you have a god given talent to act and now,' he said turning my face to the
    mirror, 'you also have  it  !'   
'What
    do you think, Belinda?' I asked slowly. 'Tell me the truth.'   
She
    ran her fingers through her hair. 'The scary thing, Chris, is that with a
    little bit of work and practise, you'd be much better. I know you find that
    hard to believe but fingernails, piercing, plucked eyebrows, waxing and electrolysis,
    you'd be bloody gorgeous.'   
'But,'
    I said shakily, 'would I be real?'   
'You
    wouldn't be a drag queen, Chrissie,' Mark said quietly, 'you'd be a woman.
    It could be your greatest performance.'   
'Ok,'
    I said softly.   
'What?'
    Belinda and Mark asked in unison.   
'I'll
    do it. It could be fun,' I said with a weak smile as Belinda kissed my cheek.   
'Now,'
    Belinda said, all business. 'You have to stay here, we will work every day.'   
'Stay
    here?'   
'I
    live upstairs and there's a spare bedroom. You'll live as a woman for the
    entire time so you're used to it. We'll need money for clothes and things.'   
I
    hung my head. 'I'm broke.'   
'I'll
    cover you,' Mark said. 'It's just a loan, my dear.'   
'You'd
    do that?'   
'We're
    friends aren't we? Of course I'll do it, Chrissie dear. I can say I'm a friend
    of,' he paused. 'What name are you going to use, I'll have to tell Lucy a
    name?'   
'I
    don't know.'   
'I
    could come up with one.'   
'I
    don't think Marylyn Mansfield is quite what we're looking for,' Belinda said
    dryly.   
'Let
    me think about it,' I said quietly staring at my reflection. I had quite
    a lot to think about.
