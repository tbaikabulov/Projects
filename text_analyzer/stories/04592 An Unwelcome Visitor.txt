Synopsis: When Abby\'s friends begin to get threatening letters, she finds herself in the hands of an unwelcome visitor. What will her fate be?







An Unwelcome Visitor

I looked at the letters lying on the table, the cut out magazine words standing out against the white background.  My friend, Joanna and her boyfriend Marty, had been getting threatening letters for over a week now, though they couldn�t work out why. Each letter had a different message � we know where you are, we are watching you, look out � and they gave me the creeps.  I had been trying to convince my friends to go to the police for the last hour, but they refused, saying it was probably  just some prank.  I couldn�t understand but had to accept their decision.  Anyway, they were going away for the weekend, saying some time away would be a good for both of them. I had been invited to join them, but I had to do a late shift and then had some gardening I just wanted to get done.  I told them to not worry about me and have a great time.

They said they were worried about me and to make sure I locked up, but I pointed out that the letters had been addressed to them not me. As they drove off, I got ready for work and hoped that they would have a relaxing weekend. Work was busy and I didn�t have time to even think about the letters or my friends. Driving home, I thought about having a long, hot bath and rolling into bed.   Pressing the button for the garage door, I had just driven the car in when something caught my eye behind the car. It had looked like a person, but when I looked again no one was there.  Thinking my tiredness was just playing tricks on me, I pressed the button to close the garage door.

Shutting the car door, I had no time to avoid the hand that wrapped itself around my neck and blocked off my air.  �Don�t scream or you�ll be sorry!� I could feel the muscles in his arm as he tightened his grip.  His other hand came and covered my mouth, as he walked me towards the door leading into the house.  It was not easy to find the right key to open the door, but eventually I got it open.  I was shaking, my mind not able to register what was happening. He pushed me inside and made me lock the door, before moving me into the lounge room.

I was pushed down onto the couch, giving me my first chance to see him.  I was not surprised to see that he was well built. His face I couldn�t see as he had on a balaclava, with only his eyes and mouth showing.   �Ok, so where are your friends?�  It took me a moment to realise he was talking about Joanna and Marty. 

 �They are away for the weekend.�  I hoped he would go now that he knew they were not here, but it seemed he had other plans.  �Well, then I might just have to leave them a message, so that they know I am serious.�  I wondered what problem he had with my friends.  �Stand up and take me to your bedroom.� His voice sounded deep and gruff, almost as if he was trying to hide his real voice.  

When I was slow to respond, he pulled me up with a firm grip on my upper arm. �When I tell you to do something, you will react right away, do you understand?�  I nodded, the reality of the situation hitting home.  Once in my room, he shut the door and I felt a surge of fear.  What did he want? What if he hurt me or raped me? I felt my body start to shake as I thought of what could happen to me. He moved to my CD player and chose one of my favourite discs, the music I loved wafting around the room. 

 �Turn around and face me!� Turning, I looked into his eyes, noticing how green they were.  �You are going to undress, like a strip tease.�  I looked at him in shock, while he stared back at me. 

�Please, don�t make me do this.�  No sooner had the words come out of my mouth, then he had my face in a tight grip. 

�Did I say I wanted conversation?�  I shook my head as much as I could and he let go.  I couldn�t look at him as I started to unbutton my blouse, my fingers trembling on the button.

 �Hey, I thought I said I wanted a tease, come on, move those hips.� I tried to move to the music, all the time waiting for him to insist I do better. Taking off my blouse, I felt embarrassed by being in my bra in front of this stranger. 

My skirt came off amid my awkward moves and then I was down to my underwear.  �Spin around for me baby.� I turned slowly, anything to delay having to actually take off my underwear.

 When I got back to my original position again, he had taken his cock out and was rubbing it up and down.  I took a step back, not waiting to be near it. He growled at me and I froze.  �Did I tell you to move?  Don�t piss me off or you will be sorry.� 

I quickly reached behind to undo my bra, remembering to move my hips at the same time.  A sob escaped my lips as I pulled it off and dropped it to the floor.  He still had his hand on his cock as I brought my hand down to the waistband of my underpants.  �Go on, show me what you have hidden down there.�  

Slowly I pulled down my pants, the tears now starting to flow, as I knew I was now naked. He let go of his cock, putting it back into his pants.  He headed towards me, making me have to fight the urge to run.  My mouth was dry and I was shaking, my hands moving to cover my breasts and pussy from his prying eyes.  

He didn�t say a word, just moved my hands and pulled them behind me, tying them together with some kind of rope.  I tried to get free, but though there was a little bit of give in the tie, there was no way I could get loose.  Still struggling, I noticed a red ball being lowered in front of my face. 

�Open up baby.�  I felt the ball being pushed in past my lips and tried hard to push it back out, but he was stronger and soon it was sitting firmly in my mouth.  I could feel the ball filling my mouth and moaned as I realised it was not going to come out without him undoing it. 

He was now walking around me, his hands running over my body until they rested on my breasts. �These really are beautiful, but I think I can make them look even better.� I didn�t want to know what he meant but when he pulled out some more rope and began to wind it around each breast, I started to get the picture. My breasts were getting rounder with each wind of the rope and I could only just look on in shock.  When he was done, it looked like I had two balloons on my chest and I could see my nipples standing out.  

�There, that�s better. You are almost ready.� Ready for what, I wondered. He pulled me back until I was on the bed and lay me down on my stomach, my breasts pressing painfully on the surface of the bed.  Moaning as I tried to ease the pressure, I felt him tie my ankles together and then pull my tied arms up. I could feel a stretch in my back as my hands were tied to my ankles. 

He stood back and just looked at me, his cock back in his hand as he rubbed it up and down. I started to get very nervous as he walked around the bed.   After another minute or so, he put his cock away and moved around behind me.  The feel of his fingers in my pussy made me jump, though I was amazed at how easily he had got them in. I realised I was not only wet but also soaked.  �Wow baby, you must really like this. At least it will make the next part easier.�

 I hung my head in shame as something hard and cold was pushed into my pussy, making me gasp as it just seemed to keep on going. Finally it stopped and he pulled my hair to make me look up at him. �I have to be going soon, but I wanted to leave you something to remember me by.� With that I felt the vibrations begin. It was low at first and I was able to ignore them as he moved out of the room. 

I heard the front door open and close just before the vibrations got faster and I lost all sense of time. As my orgasm approached, I could just hear what sounded like a motorbike riding away but was not able to tell which way it went as the orgasm ripped through me.  I lay my head down, the drool making a puddle on the bedcover and realised I could be here for a long time, as Joanna and Marty were not due back until the following afternoon.  

It seemed like I had been on the bed forever as I heard a car pull up outside, but I thought it was probably only a few hours since I had been tied up.  Had he come back?  I felt another orgasm start to form and tried to fight it, though I knew I would be as unsuccessful as I had been the last dozen times.  

I tensed as the front door opened but then I heard what sounded like Joanna�s voice.  Trying to scream, I began to cum again, though not as strongly as the previous one had been.  I had to let her know I was in trouble and started to rock my body till I managed to get up the bed more to try and kick something off my side table onto the floor.

At least the vibrator was quiet. I had discovered that it ran in cycles, sometimes starting up every few minutes and other times letting me have a rest before going again.  I rolled onto my side and kicked my feet out, ignoring the pain it caused in my arms. The first few tries I just kicked air and then I felt something hard and remembered my book.  After a few more tries I managed to send it flying, the thud as it hit the floor hopefully loud enough to make an impact.  When nothing happened, I tried again and managed to send my lamp crashing to the floor.  Breathing hard, I could feel the vibrator starting up again as someone knocked on the door and then opened it up slowly when I didn�t answer.

Joanna�s surprised face looked blurred as I was rocked by yet another orgasm, my body not needing very much stimulation to cum.  I felt her turn it off and I lay in an exhausted mess on the bed. The next thing I knew I was sitting in my long overdue warm bath, with Joanna fussing over me and Marty making some hot tea in the kitchen. They wanted to know what had happened, but I was just too tired to talk about it and told them I would tell them in the morning.  I was even too tired to wonder why they were home so early and after my cup of tea, went straight back to bed, this time to sleep.








Chapter 2

I woke to the sounds of a tray being placed somewhere in the room and the smell of coffee.  Joanna�s voice drifted into my still sleepy head a few times before I opened my eyes to see her concerned face looking down at me. �Hey there Abby, sorry to have to wake you, but some detectives are coming around soon.�   For a moment I couldn�t work out why that would concern me and then the memory of what had happened last night came back to me. Moaning, I moved to sit up, my sore muscles another reminder of the events of the night before. 

�Here, have a drink and it should help to clear your head a bit.� I took a sip of the strong coffee, each sip helping to wake me up a bit more. The food was wonderful and before I knew it, the tray was empty.  I looked over at my clock and was surprised to see it was early afternoon. �We thought it best to let you sleep after your ordeal.  So you feel ok to have a shower by yourself or do you want me to help you?�  For just slightest moment there was a gleam in her eyes but then it faded and I decided I must have been imagining things.  

�Thanks, but I think I will be fine.� She left me to shower and dress, the doorbell ringing as I walked into the lounge room.  Joanna was just showing the two detectives into the room and Marty was standing behind the couch.  I hesitated, the memory of the masked man standing over me sitting on the same couch coming unbidden into my mind. 

�Abby, this is Detective Ryan and his partner Detective Jones. They want to ask you what happened last night, but if you aren�t up to it yet, just say so.�  I looked at their faces and knew I would have to do it sometime, so I might as well get it over with.  

�Now is ok but I don�t know how much help I will be.� I sat down on one of the chairs around the dining table and everyone moved to join me.  Detective Jones pulled out a notebook and pen, while the other one looked up at me, his eyes piercing. 

�Now Abby, though it may be hard, I need you to tell me everything that happened last night.�  I started to tell them about what time I had come home and about seeing something behind the car. When I got to the part where he grabbed me, Detective Ryan interrupted me with a question. 

�You say he had you around the neck? Did you notice if he was already aroused?�  I was surprised at first, wondering what his question had to do with anything, but then assumed he must have a reason. I had to think back and tried to recall if he had been or not.

�Um, I�m not sure?�  I still thought it was a strange question but was doing my best to think try to think of if he had been aroused or not.

�Surely if he was holding you so close, you would have noticed?�  Again I thought it was strange he needed to know, but as no one else was reacting to the question, I guessed I was just being overly sensitive. 

�No, wait maybe he was.�  He let it go and I continued with my story, only being stopped when I got to the part about him playing with himself while I was made to strip. 

�Tell me, what size was his cock?�  I paused, my mouth open, again surprised by his question.  Like before, no one else thought it strange, so I answered him. 

�It must have been about 6 or 7 inches in length.�  I thought I noticed a glance between Joanna and Marty but couldn�t be sure.  

�And thickness, how thick would you say it was.� That was harder to say, my mind having to try to picture it. 

�Not sure exactly, but he was just able to make his fingers meet around it.�  I reached for the glass of water on the table, the memory of his hand rubbing up and down his penis making my throat dry  

�Ok, so this jerking off, was it fast or slow?�  

�Slow.� He let me continue until I got to him pushing in the vibrator, which Joanna had placed on the table a few minutes earlier.  Looking at it, I could almost feel it in me again and had to suppress a moan.  

�You said he was able to push it in without any pain. Why was that do you think?�  This time I was sure he had gone too far, but like before there were no reactions. Sighing, I tried to think of the least embarrassing way to answer him. 

�I.. I guess my body was reacting to what he was doing.�  I had to look down, sure my face was red, and was pleased when Joanna gripped my hand and gave it a squeeze of support. 

�So, you were enjoying what he was doing?�  

�Hey, what had that got to do with anything?� I just couldn�t help myself. 

�Sorry Miss, but the more we know about what happened the more chance we have of catching him.� 

Detective Jones spoke for the first time. �Maybe we can leave that question, Sir?�  Her comment earned her a fierce glance and she looked down again.  I wondered what kind of a working relationship they had, certainly he was in charge. 

However, he did let me move on, my heart racing with the thought of telling them about my multiple orgasms.  I thought they were satisfied as I got to the part about hearing Joanna and Marty get home, but it was not to be. 

�So, you didn�t take long to have your first orgasm? Tell me about it?� That was just too personal and I burst into tears. 

�Detective, surely that has nothing to do with finding the culprit and I think she has had enough for one day!�  Joanna stood me up and led me back to my room, staying with me until we heard the front door close. 

Marty stood in the doorway, looking a bit embarrassed.  I had told the detectives that the guy was built much like Marty, but with blonde hair and very green eyes, whereas Marty had deep brown eyes and a mess of curly, dark hair.  �They are gone now. I have a good mind to ring their supervisor and tell them, but it won�t change anything, I suppose.�  I looked at my friends, grateful to have them here to support me.

�We just feel so guilty, after all it was us the creep was after, though we still have no idea why.�  Joanna looked like she was about to cry and I hugged her tight, both for her and for me.  I was still upset and it wasn�t long before I was sobbing into her shoulder.

 Marty moved to sit beside me and as I broke off the hug, he brought his arm around my shoulder, the sudden movement making me jump.  �Oh god Abby, I am so sorry. I should have realised you would still be nervous.�  Nervous was an understatement, after the detective�s visit, I was a mess.  Joanna went to get something, leaving me alone with Marty. 

He just looked at his hands and this time it was me who felt sorry for him. �Marty, I know you were just trying to help me, no harm done ok?� He smiled and looked up at me, just as Joanna came in with some tablets in her hand. 

�Abby, I know you don�t really like pills but I think it would be a good idea to take some and get some more sleep.  They are not too strong and will not leave you with a headache.  Here, take them now and I am sure you will feel much better when you wake up.� 

I hesitated only a moment, before taking the pills, knowing I would only relive the whole thing again and again if I didn�t.  It didn�t take long for the pills to take effect and I was only vaguely aware of my shoes coming off and being lowered onto the bed before darkness embraced me.










Chapter 3

Something woke me up and I sat up in my bed. The clock said it was 2am and I was just about ready to get out of bed, when I heard a sound coming from just outside my room. I took a deep breath and went to have a look, thinking it was probably just Marty or Joanna getting a drink or something.  What I saw almost made me freeze and wish I had just stayed in my room.  There on the floor, just in front of the couch, was Joanna with her hands and legs tied together and a gag in her mouth.  I went to help her, when I heard a noise behind me and turned to see the same man who had attacked me the other night.  

I bolted to the door not even getting three steps away before I was grabbed and pulled up tight to the man�s body, his hand again covering my mouth.  Despite my fears, I could not help but notice that he was erect, the voice of the detective running through my head.  

�Well, I was going to let you sleep but it seems you wanted to join in the fun.�  I struggled in his grip, not wanting to be near him after what he had done, but his grip held me firm. He manoeuvred me into the room and turned me to face him.  

�Baby, I�ve been thinking about you and how you managed with that vibrator. Did you have fun?� He lifted up my skirt and pulled down my underpants to my knees, effectively hobbling me.  His fingers dipped down and ran along my slit, making me squirm in his grip.  I was astounded that I was wet and felt a blush rise to my cheeks.

He laughed and pushed two fingers in, pumping me right there in my own living room and beside my best friend.  Trying to stop my orgasm from forming was becoming impossible, my body starting to get that familiar tingling feeling.  When he pulled his fingers out, I groaned in frustration and then realised what I had done.  My cheeks burned even more as he just laughed at me and held his fingers up to my lips. 

I shook my head but a grip on my hair soon had me still and he just pushed his fingers to my lips until the pressure got too much and I was forced to let them into my mouth.  The taste was not too bad but the thought it was my own juices I was tasting made me feel strange.  �Like that baby?  Well, get used to it.�  I didn�t even want to think what he meant as he moved me into my room, leaving Joanna moaning on the floor.  

Not believing it was happening to me again, I felt him bring me to a stop just in front of my bed. Pulling me in close, he leant down to whisper in my ear. �Baby, you didn�t tell me how you liked the vibrator. I can just imagine you cumming over and over. Is that what happened?� I could only nod as tears came to my eyes. 

�Good, I am glad you had some fun, but tonight I think we can improve on that.� He pushed me onto the bed before I had the chance to even think about what he might have in mind.  The sound of another person coming into the room startled me and I looked up to see another man in a balaclava standing in the doorway.  

�Mate, the guy is out to it for a while and well secured. Do you want any help here or should I see to the other one?� My mind was whirling as I hoped he hadn�t hurt Marty.  

�Bring the other girl in here.� I grunted as I was pulled to sit up and my shirt ripped from my body, followed by my bra.  Trying to stop him seemed useless, as he just used his strength to overpower me. Once I was naked apart from my skirt, he lowered me back onto the bed and proceeded to tie my hands to the top of the bed.  

I pulled on my hands, but like last time, his ties were firm.  My underpants were still knotted around my thighs, so it was easy for him to pull off my skirt and then take the panties off completely.  I thought of kicking out but he gave me no chance, sitting on one leg while he tied the other and then securing the other one, till I was spread wide open.  

The door opened and the other man came in with Joanna being forced to hop along in front of him.  She didn�t look at my face as she was made to stand by the bed, her hair being held tightly. �What a pretty sight, two beautiful, bound girls, ours to do whatever we want to.�  My heart was beating fast in my chest and I tried again to get out of the ties holding me to the bed. They both untied Joanna, removing her gag too, and forced her to straddle me, with her head facing towards my feet and her pussy right in my face. She was retied over me and I started to get an idea of what they had in mind. 

�Girls, this is a little game I like to play.  You have to make each other cum before we cum. If you succeed, we will let you stop. If you fail, we get to use these on you.�  I looked under Joanna�s leg to see him holding up what looked like a riding crop you would use on a horse.  I had no desire to feel it but the thought of making Joanna cum wasn�t too inviting either.  

I jumped as I felt Joanna�s tongue on my pussy, licking me and then finding my clit. Thinking she must have been really scared of the crop to start so quickly, I realised it would not just be me hit but my friend. Taking a deep breath, I poked out my tongue and gave a tentative lick.  It was different but not so bad, so I repeated the move. Beside me I was aware of the two men jerking their cocks but didn�t know how close there were to cumming. 

Knowing I would have to get going, I found her clit and licked it, her moans letting me know she liked it.  I got braver and used my teeth, hearing more moans. She was also making me moan as her tongue dipped into my pussy, a move I repeated on her.  I was just getting close when  I saw a cock near my face and felt the sticky substance hit me in the forehead.  The other guy must have cum too as Joanna�s head was lifted and mine pushed back down onto the bed, again leaving me frustrated.  

�That was a good show girls, it makes me think you have done this type of thing before.�  Joanna�s hands must have been released as she was made to kneel on the bed, her feet still tied each side of my head.  I felt a pull on my nipples as the man who had tied me the other night pinched them. Moaning with the pain, the other man placed a gag in my mouth just as something tight was added to each nipple. 

When I was able to look, there were two silver clamps on each nipple. Not stopping there, a piece of rope was tied to each clamp and then pulled up to secure Joanna�s hands behind her back.  I watched as rope was tied in Joanna�s hair and her hands were pulled up her back, her elbows bending, and then tied to the rope in her hair.  I now knew that even the slightest pull of her arms would pull the clamps on my nipples and cause me great pain.  What I could also see was that any movement of her arms down would pull her hair back painfully. 

�Abby, I can see you are already working out what will happen if Joanna pulls her arms or even her head up.  Let�s hope she can sit still.�  I hoped so too but as soon as they started to use the crops Joanna jumped each time she was struck, causing my nipples to suffer.  I could see that she was also suffering, her head being pulled back each time her hands pulled down.  

Breathing hard, I felt the crop hit me on my upper thighs and understood why Joanna had reacted the way she had. The whacks continued up my body, the one between my legs taking my breath away. They continued to hit us both until I thought my nipples were going to be pulled off. I was screaming at them to stop, though the gag muted my screams a bit. I wondered if the neighbours could hear, though I knew all the windows were shut.    

Finally they did stop, dropping the crops on the ground and untying the rope around Joanna�s hair before untying her hands.   I thought it unfair that they hadn�t taken the clamps off my nipples first, each tug as they untied Joanna sending more pain through me.  By the time Joanna was free and off the bed, I couldn�t see for the tears and my nipples were in agony.  

Someone sat on the bed and I flinched, not ready for any more pain. When I felt a hand brush the hair from my face, I opened my eyes to see the green eyes of my original attacker staring at me. I thought I could see a touch of compassion there but this soon faded. �Baby, you look so hot, with you hair all messy and those beautiful marks on your body, I just have to do one more thing I want to do before I go.�  

I closed my eyes again, just wishing him gone and when I opened them, I realised we were alone and that he was undressing.  Tugging at the ropes yet again, I had to scream as I awakened the pain in my nipples once again. He came back to sit on the bed and without a word, pulled off each clamp.  I screamed again as more pain radiated through my sore nipples and he gave each one a rub.  They still throbbed as he stood up and moved to straddle me, his cock bobbing up and down as he moved.  

He moved it right to the entrance of my pussy and slid it right in, my pussy so wet he had no trouble at all.   In fact, I was wetter than I had ever been and didn�t know why.  He pumped away, getting faster with each thrust, until he was powering into me.   For the third time that night, I felt my orgasm approaching and knew it would be a big one. His body was covered with sweat making his muscles stand out even more, and I found myself admiring his body. With a jolt, I realised how very wrong that was and wondered what was happening to me. 

My breathing was growing short as my orgasm got closer and just as he started to cum, I did too and it was the most amazing orgasm I had ever had.  I thought I was going to pass out as by body was shaken in my bonds, the feeling of the restraints just adding to the strength of each tremor.   I hadn�t even noticed the cum he had deposited on my breasts and body until I started to come down and for the moment I didn�t care.  

I felt the gag being removed and sucked in some deep breaths as he moved to untie one arm.  �Baby, it is time for me to go but I have to say that was something.�  He left me then and by the time I got my other limbs free and managed to stand, I heard a car pulling away and was sure the men would be long gone.

Remembering my friends, I pulled on my bathrobe and raced down the hall.  I knocked on their door and Joanna�s voice told me to come in.  I opened the door cautiously, not sure what I would find, and saw Joanna wiping Marty�s forehead with a cloth as he lay on the bed.  He had a red mark on one cheek and there were ropes on the bed beside him. �How is he?�  

�He�ll be ok, but he is still a bit groggy. He was knocked out and then tied up, but he started to come around just as the men left.  Are you ok?�  I started to cry, thinking of how I had been raped and Joanna came around to hug me.

�Honey, what is it. Did something happen after I was taken from the room?� 

I nodded. �He raped me.�  I still could not believe it and let her hold me until we heard Marty moaning on the bed. He was trying to sit up and then fell back onto the pillow, his hands holding his head.  

�Lie back down, sweetheart. You had a knock to your head and were out cold, so you just need take it easy.� He moaned again but didn�t move and I realised Joanna hadn�t said what had happened to her when she had been taken from the room. 

�Joanna, the man, he didn�t? I mean you weren�t?� She shook her head and I felt relieved that at least she had been spared. 

�Abby, will you be ok by yourself tonight or do you want to stay in here with us?� I really didn�t want to go back to my room and nodded. 

�I just need to have a shower and then I will be back. Joanna thank you, I don�t know what I would do without you. Oh, shouldn�t we ring the police?�  Marty moaned and Joanna went to his side and held the cloth up to his head.  

�We will in the morning. I mean the men are long gone now and I just don�t think I could deal with that Detective right now.�  I agreed and went off to have my shower, thinking how strange the last few days have been. 

&nbsp;








Chapter 4

The next morning, I awoke to find a hand on my breast and was about to scream when I remembered where I was. I opened my eyes to see Marty�s hand resting on my breast and could feel Joanna�s soft breasts pressing into my back. When I had returned from my shower the only space left in the bed had been in the middle of the two and after hesitating only a moment, I had crawled in and fell off to sleep almost immediately.  

Now I really needed to go to the toilet and tried to move Marty�s hand off me, but he moved and actually got a firmer grip. I had to bit my lip as he unknowingly pinched my nipple in his fingers. I tried to pry his hand off and after a few minutes managed to get it off me. It took a while to wiggle out without disturbing them too much and as soon as I was off the bed, Joanna rolled over in her sleep and Marty�s hand settled down on her breast instead. 

I left them like that and after using the toilet, made myself a cup of coffee and took it out to the back steps.  The day was a beautiful one and I felt at peace for a while, before images from last night started to come back to me. A sound behind me made me spill some coffee on my robe and I turned to see Joanna standing there. 

�I though you might be out here. Are you ok?�  

I thought, am I ok? �I don�t know, I am not really sure how I�m feeling.�  She seemed to accept that and sat down beside me. 

�Marty has rung those two detectives again and they�ll be here soon.�  We were joined by Marty with a tray of toast and we all ate in silence, the events of the night still fresh in all our minds.  

 It was an hour or so later, sitting at the table again talking to the detectives that I got the feeling something was not quite right.  Something Detective Ryan had done had reminded me of the man from the night before and I couldn�t get the feeling that he was one of the men out of my mind.  I knew it sounded crazy, so I asked to be excused, pretending to be too upset to continue and just as I had hoped, Joanna came to find out how I was. 

�Joanna am I crazy or is Detective Ryan one of the men from last night?� She just stared at me. �Think about it. He is the same height and colouring, but what got me thinking was the way he moved, kind of slow and the way he says certain words.  What do you think?�  I thought I could see a slight grin on her face but must have been mistaken. 

�Abby, what I think is that you have been through a lot and are just finding things in common out of stress. I am sure that if you come back inside you will see things differently.� 

I allowed her to led me back to sit down. I saw her glance briefly at each person in turn, almost as if she was giving each one a signal or something. They were busy questioning Marty, so I had the chance to observe everyone. I thought Detective Jones seemed rather nervous and if I wasn�t wrong, there was a faint mark around her wrist almost as if she had been tied up. 

It wasn�t something I would have usually noticed but I had marks just the same after I had been tied up on the first night.  Another thing I noticed was the way they all seemed to know just what to say. Neither Marty nor Joanna hesitated in their answers, unlike me yesterday.  

Shaking my head to clear it, I stood up and went to get a drink from the kitchen still sure that something strange was going on. I heard footsteps behind me and was pleased to see Joanna.  �Abby, are you ok?  I am really getting worried about you.�  I took another sip of water, trying to get a clear head. 

�I�m not sure, I just keep getting a strange feeling but I suppose with all that has been happening, it is expected that things might not feel right.�  I had just decided I must have been imagining things when Marty came into the room. 

�Girls, Detective Ryan needs to talk Abby a bit more. Do you feel up to it love?�  I couldn�t help but think that the one good thing that had come out of the events of the last few days was the way I was seeing Marty in a new light. I had always thought he was ok but he had just been so supportive and caring.  

�Sure, I�ll be right in.� Taking another sip of water, I braced myself for another round of personal and embarrassing questions.  I sat back down at the table, seeing Detective Ryan giving his partner a glare before he turned back to me. I still could not shake the feeling that he was involved but put it to the back of my mind as he continued his questioning. 

�So, Abby, can you tell me anything more about the man who attacked you on two occasions.�  I thought back to think of any new information I could give him. 

�No, I don�t think so.� It seemed like he was relieved for a moment and I looked to see if Marty or Joanna had noticed it too, but they showed no sign that they had. The next few questions were fairly routine and then he got to what happened between Joanna and me.

�You say, Abby, that you were forced to make Joanna cum. Had you ever done anything like that before?�  I blushed and shook my head. �So how so you think you knew what to do?�  I looked down at my hands, not able to look into his face. 

�I just did what Joanna was doing to me.  I didn�t want to but I knew I had to.�  I took another sip of water, his next question making me spit the water out all over the table. 

�Abby, did you like the way it felt to have Joanna�s mouth on your pussy?�  He had a strange twinkle in his eye that made me feel uneasy but before I had the chance to answer, Marty stood up. 

�I think we have been very patient Detective and I really don�t think Abby should have to answer a question like that. Now if you have any other reasonable questions to ask, please do, otherwise I think it is time you left.�  Feeling grateful I didn�t have to answer the question, the detectives looked at each other and stood up. 

�Sorry if I have upset you.   Please call if you think of anything else and make sure you lock up.�  He moved to stand beside Detective Jones and I thought it was strange how once she was standing, he took her by the elbow and led her to the door. 

When they had gone, I sat down and tried to work out what was going on. I suddenly realised one of the things that had been strange was that not once had Detective Ryan suggested that we see a doctor. Joanna sat down beside me and I thought I would see what she said. �Shouldn�t I go to the hospital? I mean, don�t they have to do a rape kit?� 

I had expected her to agree with me, so I was taken aback when she just shook her head. �No, I mean, do you want to have to answer a whole lot of questions again and have someone poke around in your private parts.� I didn�t want that but still felt I should go and have the test.  

�I don�t know, I mean what if they catch the guy and there�s no evidence?� As soon as I said it, I knew that my shower last night would have washed most if not all of the evidence off me. Marty had just walked in and sat down on a nearby armchair. �Marty, do you think I should go to the hospital?� 

�Why, I mean you are not hurt are you?  I heard what you said about evidence and surely you washed it all off in the shower.�  He sounded different and I got that same uneasy feeling I had felt earlier.  
�I don�t know, maybe we should leave it up to the hospital to decide that.� I went to stand up only to have Joanna take me into her arms. 

�Love, how about you go and have a rest first before you do that.  You have had an emotional morning and I think you need to take it easy for a while.� Marty took me by the arm and led me in the direction of my room. �Joanna�s right, let yourself relax and then we can drive you in this afternoon.�  

I agreed, feeling the pressure to conform to their wishes as I was led into my room.  It had been the first time I had been in the room since the attack and I was surprised by how the images just rushed on back. Turning to leave the room, Marty stopped my exit, holding me in his arms.

�Abby, it�s ok.  If you don�t want to stay here, then just come into our room.�  He didn�t even give me time to reply, leading me back to the bed I had spent the night in. �Lie down and try to relax�  He sat on the bed beside me and gently stroked my hair, just like my mother used to do when I was sick.  When he thought I was asleep, he quietly left the room.  Not long after, I could hear hushed whispers outside and crept to the door to try to hear what they were saying.

Part of me felt ashamed at listening to what they were saying but I still couldn�t shake that uneasy feeling.  I couldn�t make out all of what they were saying but I heard enough to make me think seriously about what was going on. Suddenly the whispers stopped and I hurried back to the bed. I had just put my head back down on the pillow when the door opened .  

I tried to slow down my breathing and to stay still until I heard the door close softly.  In my head I thought about what I had heard, about how Marty had been talking about not letting me go to the hospital, even though they would not be likely to find anything. But that was not what had really shaken me up, it was her response. Joanna had called him Sir!  

What was going on? Was the Detective in on it and worst still were Marty and Joanna part of what was going on too?   I  spent the next hour or so trying to get things sorted in my head but just ended up going around in circles. By the end I tried to convince myself that there could be any number of reasons why Marty didn�t want me to go the hospital and that maybe I had misheard Joanna. 

When the door again opened slowly, I tried to pretend to sleep again but the smell of food made my stomach rumble. �Abby, you awake?�  It was Joanna and without meaning to, I opened my eyes a fraction as she put the plate down on the table.  �Abby, I have some lunch for you. Come on, I know you are awake.�  

I opened my eyes up then and slowly sat up, all the time wondering if she really did know something about what was going on.   �Here love, I made this especially for you.�  It was one of her fantastic stir-fries and I couldn�t help but try some.  We sat in silence while I ate, my head trying to connect the events of the last few days with this kind, caring woman.  I thought I would test my theory and ask her about visiting the hospital.  �Joanna, what time do you think we can go into the hospital?� 

She made herself busy with the plate and couldn�t seem to look at me. �Not sure yet, I think Marty has something he needs to do first.�  She left the room in a hurry and I was just about to follow her, when Marty entered the room. 

�How are you feeling now Abby?  Hope you are feeling a bit better?�  I felt the uneasiness returning as he shut the door but I tried not to let him see it. I didn�t want him to think I didn�t trust him, even though I was starting to feel that way.

�Much better, thanks Marty.  I was just asking about what time we could go into the hospital.  Abby said you had something to do first?�  He hesitated only a moment before nodding. 

 �Yes, I have to go out and see someone for work and then I can take you when I come back. It is an emergency or I would have told them to wait.� I don�t know why but I kept pushing. 

�Oh, couldn�t you take me to the hospital on the way?�  He gave me a curious look and I wondered if he knew I suspected something was not right.

 � Abby are you sure you really need to go there. As I said before, you seem ok and they�re not going to find any evidence.  Why put yourself through that?� He sounded so concerned, I started to doubt his involvement.  Maybe the only reason he didn�t want me to go was because he was worried about me.  

I didn�t get a chance to answer as the phone rang and Joanna came in to say it was for Marty. I walked out into the lounge and sat down, feeling like I was in some kind of a daze.  I didn�t want to think that my friends were involved in what was happening. I made up my mind to give them the benefit of the doubt and trust them.  Joanna came and sat down beside me, her eyes full of concern. 

�Honey, are you upset about Marty not driving you to the hospital right away? You know he only has your best interest in mind.� Nodding, I went to stand up, my head suddenly feeling dizzy. Joanna caught me and helped me to sit down. 

�Hey, are you ok? Maybe you got up too quickly.�  I couldn�t keep my eyes open and laid my head back on the couch.  I was vaguely aware of being picked up and then everything went dark.  









Chapter 5

I woke slowly, my head feeling groggy.  I tried to think what day it was and then where I was.  Looking around the room, I could see I was in Marty and Joanna�s room and it was dark outside.  How long had I been asleep for? I turned to see the clock on the bedside table and froze as I sensed a presence in the room. 

There was a dark shape in corner and just as I had convinced myself it was nothing, it moved. I went to yell out, the figure moving so fast it was on me before I got more then a small sound out.  His hand covered my mouth at the same time as his body pressed mine down to the bed. �Don�t make a sound.�  He moved quickly, tying my hands to the top of the bed and then straddling my body so he was sitting lightly on my waist.  

I could see now it was the same man who had attacked me before, but there was something different about him.  He still wore the balaclava but his eyes seemed different, though in the dark of the room it was hard to tell. I wondered where Marty and Joanna were as his hand came down to run inside my shirt.  �Have you worked it out yet Abby? Joanna was sure you had but I wasn�t so sure myself.  However, we didn�t want to risk you telling anyone, so I am here to make sure you don�t.� I didn�t understand what he was talking about at first; my head still feeling fuzzy. 

His hand reached up to the bottom of his balaclava and he gripped the bottom, seeming to pause for a moment before pulling it up over his head.  I didn�t understand why he was taking it off, my only thought being that if I saw him I would be able to identify him to the police. All thoughts of police vanished as I saw his face, or should I say Marty�s face. 

�Marty, what�s going on? I don�t und..� The rest of my words were cut off as he covered my mouth again with his hand.  He pulled a gag out and removing his hand, pushed it in till it was sitting firmly in my mouth.  Lifting up my head, he buckled it firmly in place.  I couldn�t get my head around what was going on, that my so-called friend was the same man who had attacked me.  I heard the door open and Joanna entered the room, her eyes cast down as she knelt down beside the bed.

Now I was even more confused.  I looked into Marty�s eyes, trying to see if this was just some elaborate joke but what I saw there didn�t reassure me.  Slowly it began to come together, the way he hadn�t wanted me to go to the hospital; the way I never saw him during any of the attacks.  Fear filled me, making me shake under him.  

He moved off me and walked over to where Joanna was kneeling, pulling her hair back and kissing her forcefully on the lips.  I had never seen anything so erotic and despite my predicament, found myself strangely turned on.  Marty whispered something into Joanna�s ear and she smiled, moving to sit beside me on the bed.  

I didn�t know whom to watch, as Marty came around to stand by the other side of the bed. Joanna started to pull my top up so that my bra was visible and then pulled the bra up so it sat above my breasts.  At the same time Marty had unzipped my jeans and pulled them off, his hands moving to the waistband of my panties.  I sobbed as he slowly lowered them down, again leaving my pussy exposed to his view. Marty ran his fingers up and down my slit before managing to push his finger inside.  Like the other times, I found I was wet and getting even wetter as he worked his finger in and out of me.

�Abby, I am going to let you talk soon,  as I am sure you have questions. If you are calm and don�t try to scream, the gag can stay off.�  He pulled out his finger and brought it up to his mouth, sucking my juices into his mouth. Smiling, he nodded at Joanna, who lifted my head to take off the gag.  Marty sat back up on my waist, pulling the gag out of my mouth.  An extra pillow was placed under my head, so that it was easier to keep my head up to talk.  

Now I was able to talk, I didn�t know what to say.  I was still stunned that my two friends were doing this to me.  Marty brought his hand up to my face, causing me to turn my head away from him.  �Shh, Abby, everything will be alright, except there will be a few changes around here.  Now, I am sure you have some questions, so fire away.�  

�Marty, why did you do it? I was really scared and you hurt me.�  I glared at him, my anger bubbling up inside of me.  If only my hands were free, I would have hit him, but with my hands tied the way they were, I had to settle for letting him know how I felt with my voice only.  He smiled at me and it made me even angrier with him.  

�Abby, I only acted the way I did because you liked it.  If you hadn�t, I would have left you alone after the first night.� I couldn�t believe he actually thought he had done me a favour.

�What! You think what you did was ok because you thought I liked it?  How dare you treat me that way?� I was still angry but the thought of what they would do now was starting to overtake my anger. No sooner had the words left my mouth than I started to cry.  I just felt so overwhelmed by everything that I couldn�t seem to stop the tears.  I felt Joanna�s hands on my head and despite my distrust of her; I moved my head towards her.  

I don�t know how long I cried for, but my hands were free from the top of the bed by the time I had calmed down. They were still tied together though and Marty was still astride my waist.  I brought my hands up to wipe away my tears and looked around at them both.  Marty took my chin lightly in his hands and looked into my eyes.  �Feel better now? Abby, I know this is all a bit strange and I could have handled things differently, but you have to admit you did like some of it.�

I was still not ready to admit anything of the kind. Suddenly I remembered the detectives and the way I had been questioned.  �Marty, those detectives weren�t real, were they?�  He actually looked a bit embarrassed for a moment and looked down before he turned back to look at me. 

�No, they were some friends of mine.  They were meant to just ask you some simple questions, but Jones got a bit carried away. I�m sorry about that.�  I was surprised by his apology, though it is what I would have expected the old Marty to have done. Again I felt a rush of confused emotions regarding how I felt about him.  I felt a tear slide down my cheek and felt Marty�s soft touch as he wiped it away.  

�Marty, what happens now?  You said before you were going to stop me from telling anyone, so what do you have planned?� I couldn�t believe I had been so direct but I needed to know if I was in any danger. The Marty I had thought I knew so well would never hurt anyone, but now I just didn�t know. 

He looked at me and then at Joanna. I had almost forgotten she was there and looked to see her nod at Marty and leave the room.  I felt a bit nervous that I was alone with Marty, remembering all the things he had done when I hadn�t known it was him. He waited until Joanna was out of the room and then looked at me with a serious look in his eyes.  

I felt my stomach churn at what he was going to say and lifted my tied hands to push him off me.  I must have taken him by surprise as he fell sideways on to the bed. I managed to scramble out from under him, my feet just hitting the floor, when I felt his hand on my hair.  He pulled me back onto the bed, my hands reaching up to where he was gripping my hair. 

He pulled me up till I was sitting with my back against the head of the bed, my heart beating fast.  He had kept his grip on my hair as he had moved me, but now let go, causing me to sigh in relief.  He pulled a piece of rope from his pocket and tied it around my waist and the bed post. He had placed my hands at my waist too and they were also held firmly by the rope.  By the time he sat back on the bed beside me, I knew I was not going anywhere.

Marty sat for a while, just looking at me.  I was just about to say something when he began to speak. �Abby, I know right now you have no reason to trust me, but I need you to  remember I am still the same friend you knew before. The only difference is now you know what I tried to hide from you.�

I knew he was right but the part of him I hadn�t known about was a pretty major thing.  I flinched as I saw his hand come to rest on my breast and gently rub it. Trying to block any feelings of pleasure he was generating, I breathed deeply as his touch became more firm.  One of his hands moved down to my pussy. I tried to keep my legs together, but a pinch on my nipple was enough of a warning for me to spread them. 

Marty looked me directly in the eye as he worked his finger in and out of me, the squishing sound of my own juices making me blush.  He used his thumb to rub my clit and after a good five minutes I was so close to cumming that I screamed in frustration when he stopped.  

�Now don�t tell me you didn�t like that Abby?�  I wanted to be able to tell him no but he was smiling at me in a way that told me no matter what I said, he knew I had liked it.  Instead I looked away from him and waited for him to speak again. His hand on my hair made me look back at him, his eyes again peering deeply into mine.

�Abby, before you asked me what my plans for you were. For the next two weeks you will stay in this house.  I have already told your boss you have a family emergency, so you don�t have to worry about work.  During that time, you will be free to move around the house but you will not be allowed to leave unless you are with me.  At the end of the two weeks, if you still want to go, I won�t stop you.�

He let go of my hair and I looked down, trying to think about what he had told me.  I was certain that after the two weeks were up, there was no way I was staying with him, though I had no idea where I would go.  �Marty, over those two weeks, will I have to .. Well, will you make me..�  I knew what I wanted to say but I just couldn�t bring myself to ask.

�If you are trying to ask me if you will have to join in with any fun and games, well that will be up to you.  As I said before, I think I may have gone a bit far with my little game so I won�t be forcing you to do anything you don�t want to do.  I do want you to watch and learn though, so you can make an informed choice when the time comes.�

I was still too overcome with all that had happened so far that I couldn�t really take in what he was saying.  Sensing my tiredness, Marty unwound the rope and lay me back down on the bed.  He pulled my arms up and tied them back up to the top of the bed again.  I was too tired to fight him and by the time he was done, I could hardly keep my eyes open. I was vaguely aware of Joanna entering the room and the two of them climbing into the bed beside me.  








Chapter 6

I  awoke the next morning in the bed, my hands free and no one in sight. I ran into my room to find locks on my cupboards and drawers.  When I went to try on some of Joanna�s clothes, I found the same thing in her room.  

Sighing, I  sat back down on the bed just as Marty came into the room with a tray of food.  He placed the tray on a side table and went to sit beside me on the bed. I stood up before he could sit down and moved to stand as far from him as I could.  He looked at me, an almost sad expression on his face. 

�Abby, I am sorry you are feeling uncomfortable with this new arrangement, but I just can�t let you go without you seeing what it could be like.� I couldn�t look at him, and despite him having seen me naked before, I used my hands to cover myself.

�Where are my clothes?  Surely you can�t expect me to go naked for two weeks?�  I knew the answer even before the words were out of my mouth.  He moved towards me, making me shiver as I wondered what I could expect from him today.

�Abby, I am sorry, but that is exactly what will be happening.  It is just another guarantee that you won�t go running to the police.  Apart from that, I want you to just go on as you usually would.�  He didn�t touch me and I began to relax a little bit as he left the room.  

Over the next two weeks, I remained in the house.  Marty was true to his word, he didn�t make me join in with anything but neither did he curtail his activities because I was there.  The thing that never failed to get me hot was seeing Joanna submit to Marty, but I was careful not to let them see me watching. 

I made sure I always had a book with me and if I found myself in the same room as they were, I would read by book.  Or at least I would try to read it, but I hoped they hadn�t noticed that I hardly managed to turn a page when they were in the room with me.

At the end of the two weeks, Marty and Joanna gave me back my clothes and waited anxiously for my answer.  I was nervous but knew what I had to do. 

�I won�t be staying.  I am grateful that you let me have this time to consider what my life could be like, but I just don�t think it is for me.� I saw disappointment in their faces before Marty held out a piece of paper for me to read.

What I read was a statement saying that I didn�t hold him or the others liable for anything that had happened over the last month.  I looked up at him as he handed me a pen.

�Abby, it�s not that I don�t trust you but I just need some proof that you won�t go to the police.  Please just sign it and then you are free to go.�  I took the pen and signed the paper, anything to get out of the house and away from them.  

I couldn�t look at them as I handed the paper back and went to pack my bags.  I was relieved to see the locks were off my cupboards and drawers and quickly packed up what I thought I would need.  I was almost finished when I heard someone enter the room behind me and spun around to see Joanna standing shyly in the doorway.

�Abby, I hope you don�t hate me.�  She looked close to tears and despite all that had happened, I felt sorry for her.  I dropped the clothes I was holding and took her into my arms.

�Of course I don�t hate you.  I can�t say I�m happy to be leaving or that I understand why things have to be the way they are, but I�ll always consider you a friend.�  Now we were both crying and we stayed that way for a while, the reality of my leaving hitting us both.

I finally pulled away from her and together we finished packing my bags.  Marty was waiting in the lounge room when we carried my bags out.  I was suddenly nervous again, thinking maybe he would change his mind.  

�Abby, I�m sorry you have decided to leave. I hope you will have some good memories of our time together and remember, you can change your mind anytime.�  I didn�t think that would ever happen, but choose not to say that.  I didn�t know what to say, so instead moved to the door and my waiting car.  

I was almost to the door when I felt Marty�s hand on my arm and again felt a rush of fear.  
�Abby, please look at me.  I need to know that you still at least think of me as a friend, even if I didn�t act like one.�  

I almost went out of the door, the temptation to just ignore him and go a strong one.  Instead though I looked at him.  �Marty, I did call you a friend once but I honestly can�t say what I feel for you right now.� I continued out to the car, loving the feel of the fresh air on my face. 

As I packed the car, I still half expected to be stopped but they simply helped me with my bags.  When all was ready, I got into the car and drove off without saying another word, the need to be gone all consuming.  

SIX MONTHS LATER

I was parked across from the house. It was not the first time over the last month or two that I had done this. At first, I had tried to put what had happened out of my mind, and almost succeed except for the dreams. I had found myself a new flat. with no housemates, and I was able to continue with my same job.  I didn�t move out of the city, but my flat was in a different area where I knew I would not see Marty or Joanna.

I arranged to have my mail come to my new address and soon my life seemed to be getting back to normal. I was certainly more security conscious but I tried not to let what had happened change me too much.  A few months later, I was surfing the net one day and came across a picture that left me spellbound. It showed a woman bound on the bed just like Marty had bound me. It not only reminded me of what he had done but to my shame, made me wet.  I tried to ignore it, but found myself having to look at it again and again.  

It was then that I started to think about how I had felt, something I hadn�t let myself do before.  The first day I had found myself driving to the house, I hadn�t even realised what I was doing until I was in my old street. I drove past the house, not trusting myself to stop. I tried to tell myself I was just curious as to how Marty and Joanna were, but I knew it was more than that.  

That was how I ended up parked across the street from my old house yet again.  I knew someone was home, as I had seen the curtains being pulled back.  I took a deep breath and got out of the car.  I had spent so long telling myself I just wanted to leave what had happened behind me, but I now knew I had been fooling myself.

I walked up the path and without giving myself time to think, knocked on the door.  I fought the urge to go onto my knees, as I had seen Joanna do, and waited with my heart beating for the door to open.  I was looking down and the first view I had of Marty was of his shoes.

�Abby, I was wondering when you would finally get out of the car. This must be your tenth visit. �  I blushed, knowing now that he had been aware of me the whole time.  I felt his hand on my chin and as he lifted my head up, I breathed in deeply.

�Is there something you want to say to me?�  I wanted to say no and just leave, but with him being so close again, I knew there was no turning back. 

�Marty, I � is to too late.. I need.�  Despite my lack of coherent speech, he seemed to understand and led me inside the house.  It was like nothing had changed.  He sat me down on the couch and squatted down in front of me.

�Abby, am I right in saying that you want to come back to the house?� I just nodded. �Ok, does that also mean you are ready to explore your submissive side?�  Again I nodded and was greeted with his smile.  

Without another word, he stood me up and led me into the direction of his room. I felt at peace after such a long time trying to fight my real feelings. I didn�t know where this new path would take me, but it something I knew I had to find out.
