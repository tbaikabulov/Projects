Synopsis: A struggling college freshman signs on to earn extra credit by helping a pair of grad students with their research project.  What begins as an innocent volunteer assignment leads to much more...   Freshman year was tough. Everyone had warned Chrissy that it would be, but
  truthfully she had no idea how hard it would actually turn out to be.  
 Throughout high school she had been able to cruise through her class work
  virtually stress-free, graduating with a solid, slightly above the majority
  of her class grade point average. She would never admit it aloud, but deep
  inside she knew that her reputation as an All-American girl probably had given
  her the benefit of the doubt with her teachers more than once&hellip;not to
  mention her classic good looks.  
 But college was a whole different challenge. Just six weeks into her freshman
  year she had already studied more than she had during her entire high school
  experience. Her social life was non-existent. Instead of hitting the bars off
  campus on Thursday nights, she was in the library desperately trying to keep
  her head above water. If she was going to make it out of her first semester
  alive, she was going to need help. But her five professors all appeared to
  care less about her struggles&hellip;and the two male Profs were seemed impervious
  to even the most forward flirtations.  
 Then, as the fall break approached, an announcement was made that seemed
  to offer a glimpse of hope; even it was only in one class.  
 "Ladies and gentleman," her Sociology 110 professor announced in a monotone,
  not even bothering to look up from his notebook at the front of the auditorium. "Any
  students wishing to receive extra credit toward their final exam grade may
  sign up to participate in a sociology study being conducted by my teaching
  assistants and graduate degree students, Mister Jackson and Miss Poe, as they
  work toward their advanced degrees. Participation will be worth a ten-point
  addition to your final grade. See the TA's after class if you are interested.
  We only need two students, first come first serve."  
 Chrissy sat straight up, her dark brown ponytail bobbing as she did. "Ten
  points!" She thought to herself. "That's a full letter grade!"  
 When class was dismissed, the student all but long jumped her way to the
  end of the aisle. She was second in line behind another freshman girl, a cute
  redhead that usually sat one row in front of Chrissy during class.  
 "Congratulations," the male grad student said as he approached the eager
  18-year olds with two standard legal forms snapped to a clipboard. He was a
  typical professor wannabe, conservatively dressed with short dark hair and
  glasses. "I just need you ladies to print your name, age, student ID number,
  and sign on the bottom two lines."  
 "Student ID number?" the redhead asked.  
 "Yes," the female TA spoke up with a soft smile from behind her black-rimmed
  glasses. Miss Poe always sat at a small desk next to the lectern during class
  and was gathering her papers into a leather attach&eacute; case. Beneath her
  mid-30's nerdy exterior one got the feeling that she could be much prettier
  if she ever bothered to try. "It's just your social security number, like how
  you signed in on the first day of class. We want to make sure the ten bonus
  points go to the correct students, right?"  
 The redhead filled out the top line and handed the clipboard over to Chrissy.
  With a quick glance, Chrissy saw that her name was Pam. "Thanks."  
 As he took the clipboard back, Mr. Jackson explained that the girls would
  be participating in an image and word association experiment. The idea was
  to see what effect &ndash; if any &ndash; the images and sounds from all forms
  of media actually have on the people exposed to them. Both freshmen would need
  to come to the graduate student lab just two doors down from the classroom
  at 5 pm sharp one day per week for the next four weeks. "Pam, why don't you
  come on Tuesdays, starting tomorrow, and Chrissy you stop by on Wednesdays.
  Don't worry. We should have you in and out of here in about an hour each time."  
 The look and smirk shared between the two graduate students were so sly
  and so quick they were barely perceptible&hellip;and totally missed by the
  girls.  
 The next two days were more of the same for Chrissy &ndash; class, study,
  eat, sleep. Her life had become so cyclical that she found herself actually
  looking forward to the sociology study. At least it was something different
  to do. She had hoped to ask Pam how her first visit to the lab had gone when
  they saw each other in class on Wednesday morning, but the redhead hadn't shown
  up. Chrissy figured she must have gone out the night before and decided to
  cash in one of her three absences.  
 At 4:58 pm Chrissy knocked on the door of the grad student office, fresh
  from her aerobics class at the student center gym. Despite her brutal schedule,
  she never missed her exercise class and was still a little sweaty beneath her
  workout clothes - a short-sleeved university t-shirt, gray Russell running
  shorts, and a hooded sweatshirt rolled up and tied around her waist by the
  sleeves. She had always prided herself on looking "put together" and so she
  had stopped in the hallway bathroom just long enough to put on a little powder,
  mascara, and lip gloss. As she walked down the hallway, she was surprised at
  how empty the science building was. Wow, she thought to herself, these professors
  sure bolt out of her in a hurry when classes are over.  
 "Come on in, Chrissy," Mr. Jackson called out from inside the small office.
  When she walked in, the student saw the two TA's sitting side by side, discussing
  something on the computer screen in front of them. When they saw her, they
  quickly clicked the window closed.  
 "Have a seat," Miss Poe said as she stood and offered her chair. "Thanks
  so much for agreeing to help us."  
 "No problem," the female grad student always helped Chrissy relax with her
  soft eyes and calming speech. "So, how exactly am I going to help?"  
 Poe wore a white lab coat, which Chrissy briefly thought odd for a sociology
  student, and leaned back onto the desk behind her. "We as Americans are bombarded
  each and every day with thousands of images, sounds and words everywhere we
  go. TV, radio, the Internet, newspapers, movies, everything. As you know, there
  has always been a debate over what kind of damage this rapid-fire imagery is
  actually doing to our minds. Parents claim it causes their kids to suffer from
  attention deficit disorder. People blame the Columbine tragedy on The
  Matrix  . Ted Bundy said he thought nothing of women because his
  mind was altered by exposure to pornography."  
 "So," Mr. Jackson spoke up now. "We are going to flash images and sounds
  to you, all taken from American pop culture. Some will be pleasant, some not
  so pleasant. And we want to monitor your reaction to those things that we expose
  you to."  
 "Oh okay," Chrissy paused, choosing her words carefully before speaking
  for fear of blowing her chance at the ten bonus points. "Um, how unpleasant?"  
 "Nothing anymore violent or sexual than you might see on HBO every night," he
  explained as he pulled some wiring from a drawer. "Now if you will come with
  us, we'll get started and get you out of here before rush hour at the dining
  hall."  
 They walked across the hallway and into a very small room, not much bigger
  than a typical walk-in closet. In the center of the room was a old leather
  recliner, patched together in places with what appeared to be vinyl tape. On
  the wall was mounted a fairly large television screen, maybe 40 inches across,
  and only a few feet from the foot of the recliner, cramped by the quarters
  of the tiny space.  
 "This is our video screening room," Miss Poe explained. "You get comfortable
  in the chair and I will start turning things on in here."  
 She clicked on the television, upon which a standard set of color bars was
  shown with the words "SOC. DEPT" typed across the black car than ran through
  the center of screen. Once Chrissy was settled in, Mr. Jackson explained the
  next step.  
 "We have some standard electrode patches here, like you would find connected
  to any hospital EKG. I am going to put six of these on some of your pulse point
  - two on either side of your neck, one on each bicep, and one on each of your
  thighs. They stick to your skin directly with a little foam tape, and they
  won't hurt when we remove them. Would you mind rolling up your t-shirt sleeves
  for me? Thanks."  
 The dabs of prep gel and each electrode patch were cold as first touch,
  but soon warmed on Chrissy's skin. Mr. Jackson politely asked his female partner
  to position the pads on the insides of the freshman's thighs, just slightly
  below the hem of her cotton running shorts, citing how inappropriate it would
  be for him to do so. He attached tiny white wires to each of the six patches
  and then excused himself from the room, explaining that he would be controlling
  the video playback from a computer across the hall in the lab office.  
 "Two more things, Chrissy, and we will be finished. I am going to put these
  earpieces in for you. We used to play the audio directly from the television
  speakers, but we got too many complaints from other professors and TA's on
  the hall about the noise."  
 "Is that why all of that foam is on the walls?"  
 "Exactly, that's soundproofing material. Just like you would see in a recording
  studio. Once I shut the door, you can't hear a thing outside in the hallway,
  but we started using the earphones anyway just to make the University administration
  happy."  
 The plastic pieces slid into the brunette's ear canals, made easy by the
  fact that her hair was up in its practically permanent ponytail. Miss Poe pulled
  a tiny headset from her lab coat pocket and slipped it onto her head, reminding
  Chrissy of the microphone she wore while working the drive thru at McDonald's
  two summers ago. With a click, she could hear the grad student speak to her.  
 "Can you hear me okay? Good. Alright, last step. A lot of movement has a
  tendency to alter our readings from the EKG monitor, so I am going to immobilize
  you just a bit."  
 Immobilize? Chrissy was already a little nervous, but now she was just confused.  
 "It's nothing, just a couple of straps over your forearm so they sit flush
  to the arms of the chair. This is an old machine that was donated from the
  local hospital and even the slightest movements alter our chart readings." With
  a tug, what Chrissy thought was tape holding an old chair together was actually
  revealed as nylon straps that now pulled her forearms down hard into the fake
  leather.  
 "Wait, Miss Poe&hellip;"  
 Similar strips were produced and strapped around her ankles, just above
  the tops of her Reebok running shoes. Next came what looked like an airplane
  seat belt, a click and another tug pulled on her hips and forced her lower
  back into the crease between the back and seat sections of the chair. As the
  girl visibly began to panic, the grad student stood and looked her directly
  in the eyes.  
 Click&hellip; "Chrissy, trust me. This is just a precaution to ensure that
  our study goes off without a hitch. Mr. Jackson and I have been working on
  this research for two years now and we really do appreciate you helping us
  out. Okay?"  
 She smiled that warm, reassuring smile again, and Chrissy relaxed, though
  still a bit nervous. "Okay," she replied with a shaky sigh of relief.  
 "Alright then. I'm heading across the hall. Have fun, alright? We'll be
  done in no time."  
 With that, the TA turned and left, flicking off the light switch and shutting
  the door behind her. Now Chrissy sat alone in the tiny room, her face lit by
  the color bars coming from the television screen, unable to hear a thing and
  able only squirm in the chair.  
 Click&hellip; "Okay, Chrissy." It was the voice of Mr. Jackson. "We're going
  to start now. Just relax and react naturally to what you see. The computer
  will show us how the visuals affect your heart rate and body temperature. We
  can also see you by way of a video camera mounted in the wall above the TV.
  If you start to get claustrophobic or just need a break, wave your left hand.
  Can you do that for me? Good, we can see it. I know it's tough with the straps.
  Thanks again for doing this."  
 The color bars disappeared. For a brief second, the screen was black and
  the room was totally dark, but then a picture popped up. It was the beginning
  of a montage of news footage. First a story about the economy from CNN, then
  a report on the Laci Peterson murder trial from ABC News. The audio was being
  pumped directly into her ears via the headphones.  
 Next was a series of television commercials &ndash; one for Pepsi, then
  one for Viagra. The third ad was for Wal-Mart. Now totally relaxed, Chrissy
  began to wonder to herself what was so unusual about this. It looked like normal
  channel surfing to her.  
That's when the then visions began to change.  
First was a provocative Victoria's Secret spot. Strong, beautiful women strode
  across the screen to the boldface question "What is sexy?" She had seen the
  ad a million times before, but the pulsing techno beat in her earpieces gave
  the visuals a new, more sensual feeling.  
 Little did the freshman know that she had begun a climb through what was
  a very carefully selected series of television excerpts, each designed to be
  more sexually provocative than the next. A ramping up of her mind&hellip;and
  more importantly, her body. Across the hall, the two grad students smiled as
  they watched the digital readouts in front of them begin a slow, ragged climb
  upward.  
The Victoria's Secret ad gave way to a passionate scene from a daytime soap
  opera. That led to an even more explicit vision, this time from what looked
  to be a run-of-the-mill late night Cinemax movie. Chrissy was surprised at
  her reaction. She had never been one to shy from a sexy late night cable movie,
  but this was different. Perhaps it was from the moans of pleasure and slow
  beat music being fed in surround sound stereo directly into her ears.  
 Next was a clip straight from pay-per-view porn. A busty blonde was stroking
  and licking a tremendously large cock&hellip;the slurps and moans getting louder
  and louder.  
 "I&hellip;I&hellip;think I need a break," Chrissy called out into the room,
  eyes fixed on the blow job before her. The request disappeared into the soundproofing
  without as much as an "I" reaching the outside.  
 She had always scolded her friends for renting and watching porn with their
  boyfriends, but now her body was betraying her moral conscious. She could feel
  herself becoming wet, but her instinctive wish to close her legs and hide that
  fact were done in by her ankle bonds.  
 The blonde slut on the screen bobbed up and down faster and faster, then
  pulled back her head and stroked the cock furiously. What seemed to be a gallon
  of white cum exploded onto her face, coating her blue mascara eyes and painted
  cherry red lips&hellip;  
 In that instant, the color bars popped back onto the screen and the light
  in the room came on. Standing before her were the two grad students, both with
  giant smiles on their faces. As Miss Poe reached for the button on her headset,
  Mr. Jackson went about checking the EKG patches and their wire connections.  
 Click&hellip; "Very good, Chrissy. You really seemed to be enjoying yourself
  there. I don't blame you. I picked out those scenes and edited them together
  myself. Sometimes being a sociology student has its benefits. Would you like
  some water?"  
 Still tense from being shocked out of her sexual trance, Chrissy nodded,
  oblivious to the man placing his fingers on the electrodes taped to her limbs.
  His shyness about the subject's privacy now apparently gone, he replaced the
  white wires that were attached to the patches on her inner thighs with equally
  thin red cables. He smiled slightly when he noticed the small wet spot in the
  center of her gym shorts.  
 Poe opened a bottle of water and held it up to the freshman's lips. She
  also brushed away the few strands of Chrissy's bangs that had begun to stick
  to her forehead with sweat.  
 Click&hellip; "It looks like your sensors are all still good and in place.
  We are getting some great data in the other room."  
 "How&hellip;long&hellip;has it been since we started?" The teenager was
  completely out of breath, certain the hour was nearly up.  
 Click&hellip; "About fifteen minutes. Only 45 to go!" And with that, the
  pair was gone and the student was alone in the dark once again.  
 Again, the screen flicked alive with pornography. A woman's face was in
  the center of the screen, hair teased out and face totally made up. In from
  each side of the screen bobbed two hard cocks. The woman reached out with each
  hand and began to stroke each member furiously. The camera stayed fixed on
  her face as her eyes darted back and forth from dick to dick.  
 Meanwhile, a sultry female's voice joined the sounds of duel hand jobs in
  Chrissy's headphones.  
 "You love the thought of two cocks in your face, don't you? The wish that
  two loads of cum would end up all over you&hellip;all over your face, your
  tits, your tongue. You really are a slut, aren't you?"  
 Chrissy knew it wasn't possible, but it was as if the voice in her ears
  was speaking directly to her. She felt her face grow flush when she realized
  that she had begun to nod "yes" to the woman's question.  
 The woman on the screen kept pumping away, and soon she had her head tilted
  back and mouth wide open, waiting on the two anonymous men to burst.  
 Totally entranced by the vision in front of her, Chrissy began to feel warmth
  beneath her bottom. She looked down, pushing her bottom back into the seat
  to try and detect the source of the sensation. The realization made her panic.
  The seat was vibrating beneath her.  
 Click&hellip;it was Miss Poe. "Chrissy, your heart rate just jumped tremendously.
  Is everything okay?" Then, just as the grad student's transmission clicked
  off, the freshman thought she heard something that worried her &ndash; laughter.  
 When she looked back up from her soaking and vibrating crotch, the woman
  on the television screen was covered in cum, licking it from her lips and staring
  directly into the camera lens and straight into the bound student's eyes.  
 "Stop fighting it, Chrissy. Go on and cum if you want to."  
 This was too much, too personal. The teenager began to break down, thrashing
  against her bonds and screaming to be freed. The cum-soaked woman on the TV
  screen just kept smiling at her and saying her name. The sounds of sex were
  mixed in over the woman's voice, becoming louder and louder in her ears. The
  vibrating pad beneath her continued to hum away, the lap belt keeping her ass
  held firmly onto the oscillating seat cushion. She clinched her fists and squeezed
  her eyes tightly shut to keep from looking at the television, but there was
  nothing she could do about the sound&hellip;or the rhythm under her bottom,
  the leather seat now soaked with sweat and her own juices.  
 Meanwhile, a group of professors stood directly outside the door of the
  room in which she was held. They idly chatted about lesson plans, golf, and
  the weather, totally oblivious to the fact that a sexually tortured young girl
  was strapped to a recliner just a few feet away. The soundproofing had been
  worth every penny the grad students' grant money had paid.  
 Click&hellip;It was Poe again. "Okay, Chrissy, dear. It's time to stop fighting
  this."  
 On their television monitor in the lab, they could see the girl had shut
  her eyes in defiance and was shaking her head back and forth, crying "No! No!"  
 The female grad student was a little irritated by the girl's reaction. Her
  research had predicted that a young girl of relatively no sexual experience
  should have given in by now. Then again, that's why they had devised what she
  and her lab partner had coldly labeled "Stage 2: Coercion." Without looking
  away from the video feed on her monitor, Miss Poe pointed to her fellow TA, "I
  think Miss Chrissy needs a little encouragement to cooperate."  
 Without as much as a smile, Jackson rapped a series of keys on his computer.
  His right hand on the mouse, he right clicked. In an instant, the EKG monitor
  went off the chart.  
 For a second, Chrissy had thought that she could beat this. Perhaps, she
  thought, she could hold off these overwhelming sexual urges long enough to
  discourage the sick bastards in the other room and force them to let her go.  
 That's when the shock came.  
 The jolt of electricity had traveled through her body like a camera flash.
  It forced her eyes open, her body taut, and her mouth to drop wide open in
  a gasp for air. At first, it hadn't seemed real, but actual reality was reinforced
  by the second wave of shocking sensations.  
 By the third jolt, the nearly broken coed had realized that the sensation
  was entering her from inside her thighs. The red wires that had replaced the
  whites on the electrodes beneath her the hem of her shorts weren't EKG monitors
  at all. They were conductors of electricity. The horror of that fact caused
  a tiny tear to well up in the corner of her left eye. She looked upward to
  the camera on the wall.  
 Click&hellip;Poe spoke. "I see you have been introduced to our encouragement
  techniques. Listen, Chris, we can tell that you are enjoying this. The scientific
  data does not lie. Your body temperature, your heart rate, your eyes, they
  all show us that you are teetering on the brink of an orgasm. Not to mention
  the wet spot we noticed between those beautiful thighs of yours. As much time
  as you have been spending in the library, I doubt you have had one in a while,
  no?"  
 Her breathing ragged and her chest heaving up and down, the freshman lab
  rat dropped her eyes at the words from across the hallway. Now the voice in
  her ear that had once provided so much comfort was now much more hardened and
  direct.  
 "Now we will let you out of here only after you cum. Whether it takes you
  five minutes or five days. And just so you know that you aren't alone in liking
  this kind of treatment, check out your television monitor."  
 Chrissy raised her head, gasping at what she saw.  
 The image was grainy, but there was no question as to what &ndash; or who &ndash; it
  was. It was video of the very room and the very chair that she was now strapped
  to. Only the girl bound to the recliner wasn't herself. It was Pam. Her tiny
  arms were bound to the arms of the chair just as Chrissy's now were, but the
  rest of her bondage was much more elaborate. A wide black collar was around
  her neck and appeared to be attached to the headrest of the chair, keeping
  her head from thrashing about. Her long red hair was tied in a topknot ponytail,
  standing nearly straight up to make room for a criss-crossing of black leather
  straps that harnessed her face, culminating in a round red ring gag that held
  her mouth wide open. The girl's eyes were wide, wildly darting back and forth
  from behind the harness gag.  
 Click&hellip; "This was last night. Your friend here resisted for nearly
  six hours. So, we had to take her to another level in order to thoroughly complete
  our research."  
 As Chrissy continued to study the form before her, she realized that the
  girl's t-shirt had been ripped open down the middle, exposing her handful-sized
  breasts. White electrode patches circled each exposed nipple, with more down
  the center of her chest and along her belly.  
 Pam's legs were not bound like Chrissy's had been, instead they were pulled
  up and draped over the arms of the leather recliner. Straps around her knees
  and ankles kept her legs bent and, as Chrissy noticed with horror, her middle
  completely exposed. The redhead's shorts had been cut away, but her pink cotton
  panties were left on. The material was thin and failed to cover the semicircles
  of more white patches, electrodes that had clearly been adhered to the lips
  of her sex. Wires ran from beneath her underwear to places unseen on the television.
  They were all red, not white.  
 Click&hellip; "You see, Chrissy, there is no need for us to go here with
  you, is there?"  
 As if on cue, the bound girl on the video screen began to moan loudly as
  her body rose up against her bonds and she began to shake. The moans become
  stuttered and guttural, almost animal, as the ring gag kept poor Pam's mouth
  pried open. A long strand of drool began to run down from her lower lip and
  onto her exposed chest.  
 Chrissy frozen posture and widened eyes showed a girl who was terrified
  for her life. But the data streaming across the lab computer screen told a
  different story.  
 "Look at her heart rate!" Jackson said to Poe. "She's getting close, but
  I think she's about to plateau again. Should we go back to the stock footage
  that you pulled?"  
 "No," his lab partner said firmly, finger hovering over the button on her
  microphone. "Keep rolling the footage of Pam."  
 What Chrissy saw next both horrified her and showed her where she was inevitably
  headed. Pam's entire body was flush and sweat was rolling from between her
  exposed tits and down her belly line to her wired, pantied crotch. She tensed
  up, obviously reacting to a mild electrical shock&hellip;then tensed again&hellip;and
  again.  
 Now every time the girl on the television screen jerked in reaction, Chrissy
  did as well. The pulses being sent to her body were in rhythm with the ones
  that jolted poor Pam on the videotape. With each convulsion, Chrissy's bottom
  lifted up off the seat just a little. But when the charge stopped, her tight
  little bum would come to rest on the leather again, hummed to the edge by the
  vibrations below.  
 The cycle continued over and over. Shock&hellip;hum. Shock&hellip;hum. With
  each shock, the sounds of Pam's moans increased in Chrissy's earpiece. All
  the while, the female sadist across the hall repeated what the poor girl once
  resisted but now began to believe.  
 Click&hellip; "Let's go, slut. Give in. Your body is betraying you. It tells
  the truth. You love this. Being used. You little freshman slut&hellip;"  
 Shock&hellip;hum&hellip;moan. Shock&hellip;hum&hellip;moan. Shock&hellip;hum&hellip;  
 Then it happened.  
 At first, the coed thought that it was just another electrical charge. But
  this time the feeling came not from the insides of her thighs, but higher.
  The tingling sensation radiated out, washing over her legs and torso. Her fists
  clinched and her eyes slammed shut, the noise that escaped her mouth was from
  deep down within her chest. The long, sustained groan was followed by short,
  rapid breaths and another beastly moan. On the monitors across the hall, every
  line and every number suddenly escalated to the highest points on every screen
  and every chart.  
 Her tiny body bucked and jerked and shook violently, the straps stretched
  but still holding her fast. Her nipples hardened to the point that they now
  showed clearly through her sports bra and t-shirt, aching to be released. The
  wet spot between her thighs had swollen as well, revealed and hidden over and
  over again as she involuntarily ground herself against the vibrating seat pad.  
 He head tossed side to side, her ponytail coming undone and sweat pouring
  from her forehead. Mascara was starting to run down her face, tiny dark trails
  dripping from her defiantly-clinched eyes.  
 Finally, her body became nearly rigid and straight, testing the limits of
  her bondage. Her mouth opened wide as she tried to breath&hellip;and suddenly
  her eyes flew open.  
 With a gasp, her hands came open, all ten fingers pointing straight out
  and spread. And with a screaming moan, the final release occurred, the seemingly
  endless torrents of her orgasm spilling over her body.  
 Across the hall, it took all that the two graduate students could muster
  not to stand and cheer or simply give in and cum themselves.  
 Totally wrecked, Chrissy collapsed back into the chair, her breathing stilted
  and broken and her body left to the occasional twitch. Her head cocked to one
  side, she opened her eyes to look at the TV screen. There was Pam, still resisting
  her treatment, despite the addition of what looked like suction devices on
  her nipples.  
 My God, Chrissy thought to herself, why won't she just give in?  
 Click&hellip; "There now, Chris. That wasn't so bad, was it?"  
 The broken girl turned her eyes upward to the camera above, its tiny red
  light staring down at her like some twisted evil eye.  
 "Poor Pam didn't break for another hour yet. We had to resort to some pretty,
  shall we say, creative  means to finally get her there.
  You are a good girl to go on and cooperate."  
 As Miss Poe's voice continued on, Chrissy fought to keep her eyes open.
  How could I be sleepy, she thought. I have to stay awake. They will be in here
  soon to let me go and I must report this to the police. But&hellip;I&hellip;am&hellip;so
  sleepy.  
 "Keep talking," Jackson said to his research partner as he continued to
  hold down the left click button on his mouse. "The gas is entering the room
  through the air conditioning vent. Her vitals are really starting to slow down
  now."  
 Her eyelids almost completely closed now, Chrissy began to give in to her
  sleepiness. Even the occasional hard breath or spontaneous body jerk were not
  enough to wake her. As she drifted off to her gas-aided slumber, she heard
  Poe's voice one more time.  
 Click&hellip; "You get some rest now, girl. You'll need it."  
Had she been awake to witness what was happening to her, Chrissy would have felt
  like she was on the inside of a bizarre scientific nightmare. 
A man and woman in white lab coats were now working feverishly to bind her
  into total immobility. Once they were assured that the girl was fast asleep
  from the gassing, they undid the straps that held her to the recliner; Miss
  Poe undoing her ankles while Mr. Jackson loosed the freshman's arms and waist.
  Chrissy was leaned forward and her arms pushed together at the elbows behind
  her back. A black leather sleeve was produced from a non-descript backpack
  that had been carried into the room. The armbinder was slipped over her hands
  and elbows, encasing her arms all the way to the base of her shoulders and
  tightened instantly with nylon straps. 
Tossed back into the chair against her bound arms, the brunette's legs were
  bent until her knees were pushed completely against her chest and her lower
  legs pressed against the backs of her thighs. While Jackson held the unconscious
  girl into a ball, his fellow grad assistant used one�two�three�then four leather
  belts to strap her bent body together tightly. 
Once the girl was secured into such a surprisingly small package, the male
  T.A. slipped out the door, checking to make sure the hallway was clear, which
  it typically was by this hour of the evening. As he moved across the hallway,
  his counterpart carried out the finishing touches on her research subject. 
She pulled Pam's nearly undone pony tail back into shape just long enough
  to fix it in a thick French braid that was tied off at the end with a thin
  leather shoelace. A black leather head harness, similar to the one featured
  in Pam's videotape was then stretched over Chrissy's unknowing face. The black
  leather straps framed the coed's tiny features in a frighteningly erotic fashion,
  as did the glistening red ballgag that was slipped between her lips. One hard
  tug of the buckle under her chin and the ball pushed its way deep into her
  slackened jaw. 
From the left pocket of her lab coat Miss Poe revealed a black spandex hood.
  With the braid tucked behind the girl's next and being careful not to dislodge
  the earpieces, the hood was stretched over her head so that the thick padding
  of the sewn-in blindfold was placed perfectly over her closed eyes. 
From the right pocket she produced a white plastic egg and a tiny remote control.
  With a click of the remote the egg hummed to life, bringing a devilish smile
  to the woman's thin lips. Poe crouched at the base of the chair, looking up
  at the sleeping student, bound in a ball and leaning over to one side against
  the arm of the chair. With one hand she reached into the girl's gym shorts
  and curled her fingers around the lip of her panties. 
The lingering dampness made her smile even wider. 
The crotch of her underwear held aside with one hand, the other hand brought
  the egg up to the student's exposed pussy. With a gentle push, it disappeared
  inside of her. And with another click of the remote, Miss Poe leaned forward
  to listen for the hum from deep between the girl's still-sweaty thighs. 
Hmmm, the grad student thought to herself. That will be a most pleasant surprise
  to wake up to. 
As if on cue, Jackson returned to the room with a rolling cabinet. The heavy
  door to the soundproof room shut behind him, the lid on the top of the cabinet
  was opened and the two graduate students carefully lifted their bound lab rat
  and laid her down inside. Her tiny frame fit perfectly into the confinement
  of the metal box even with the lid closed and padlock applied. 
�Are we ready to roll?� He asked his associate with a smile, trying to mask
  his nervousness. 
�Yes, I believe we are.� She smiled back and held up the white remote to which
  he shook his head in joking disbelief. 
�I'm sorry I missed the installation of that particular instrument. Which
  reminds me�I almost forgot.� 
Jackson reached into his pocket and pulled out his iPod. With a couple of
  flicks of the menu wheel he called up the menu titled �Chrissy Sounds�. As
  he hit play, a looped hour-long recording began to transmit from a small low
  pulse FM antenna plugged into the iPod's earphone jack. The recording would
  be totally silent from the outside, but the girl's earpieces were now resonating
  in her ears. 
As she slept through her bondage, the freshman subject would do so to the
  sounds of rabid fucking. The moans and slapping of skin would be punctuated
  by the voice of the cock-sucking woman from Chrissy's custom-made coercion
  video. �Welcome to your new world, Chrissy. Can you hear the people fucking?
  Doesn't it sound delicious you little slut�Chrissy slut�� 
The two future professors rolled the cabinet out into the hallway, looking
  back to make sure the lab room had been returned to its normal decidedly asexual
  state. As they rolled their acquisition down the hallway, they stopped to grab
  an armload of microscopes and textbooks, piling them onto the top of the rolling
  metal cabinet. The transportation of academic tools was the perfect reasoning
  as to why any witnesses would happen to see two grad students loading a metal
  cart into a University van at 6:30 in the evening. 
Little could any of the bystanders know that beneath that pile of scientific
  instruments was the beginning of an on-going experiment. A sleeping woman,
  bound, silenced, and quietly vibrated. When finally awake, Chrissy's life would
  never be the same again.
