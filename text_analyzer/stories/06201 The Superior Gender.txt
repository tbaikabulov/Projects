&nbsp; Nathasha was finally done with her hair. She took five seconds to look at herself in the mirror. Young and as beautiful as a Goddess. Green eyes, long black hair, 5"5 and athletic. She had a killer smile. She opened the closet door and picked up a red sleeveless t-shirt and her favorite black leather pants. She would have remained in bed this morning but she had to go to school. She was hoping to finish school as soon as possible. She wanted to join the Disciplinarian Corps and work in a prisoner camp. More like a slave camp, actually. In these prisons, captives were forced to work in either a mine or on a field. Many times, Nathasha pictured herself with one of the black leather uniforms the guards wear. The jacket with the red insignia of Female Supremacy on her shoulders, the tight pants, the knee-high boots, the gloves and the cap - All in black leather, just as she likes it. She could carry the teaser gun on one side and a real one on the other.&nbsp; She would have a com badge on her left arm and carry the neuron whip on the other hand.&nbsp; She would move from one sector of the camp to another on those hovercycles. Think of it as a Japanese motorcycle without wheels. Magnetism would keep her 5 feet above the ground on the stand-by mode at all times, but for catching an escapee she could reach 500 feet easily and fly this hovercycle at 300 miles per hour.&nbsp; The prisoners were all wearing metallic, unbreakable collars that displayed their position at all time.&nbsp; All she would need to do to locate an unruly prisoner that had the misfortune to believe he could escape would be to enter the code of the slave and the monitor on the hovercycle would tell her everything she would need to know to apprehend him. She would follow the group leader, hunt the bastard through any kind of terrain and catch him in no time. This would take longer if the group leader chose to have some fun with the prisoner first.&nbsp; Day or night, they could find him. The collars were all linked to a computer station in orbit. The hovercycle was equipped with movement detectors, heat sensors, night-vision equipment and X-rays. It could fire rubber or metal bullets, lasers, miniature missiles and half a dozen kinds of gas that would paralyze or kill the culprit. 
&nbsp; The thrill of the hunt was haunting her. She saw the ads on TV from the Corps recruitment center and knew she wanted to be a guard. For a woman in a female-dominated society, whipping naked male slaves and forcing them to work was a cool job. However, Nathasha was different. For her, it would be more than cool - It would be an erotic and exciting activity.
Just the idea of entering this career - and getting well paid for it - was a turn-on to Nathasha. This was the perfect job for her. Since she was five, she was raised to be dominant. Even though she was the youngest, she was permitted to give orders to her older brothers since she was twelve. They were three and five years older than her, but they had to clean up after her, leave her the furniture and sit on the floor, fetch drinks and report to her after the chores she had given them were finished.&nbsp; When her mother was outside the house, she was in charge, even if her father was present. He had to submit to her just like the other males in the house just because she was female. In this world, that was reason enough.



This was the traditional roles of men and women in North America and Europe since the 80's. The males were still lucky. On the other continents, they weren't treated so well. 

History lesson: 
In 1950, five years after World War II, a group of women decided they had enough of seeing men in power. Obviously, the males couldn't do the job right.&nbsp; The first feminist movement was formed.&nbsp; These women organized a subtle takeover of vital areas of control throughout the male-dominated society. In time, they built a power base, but this was just the beginning. 
Ten years later, there were more women than men in universities.&nbsp; Already by 1980, women were getting better paying jobs than men. The males resisted. Many didn't want to loose their dominant roles, but these women were smart.&nbsp; They knew how men could easily be controlled by their dicks.&nbsp; They created a secret program to establish a strong matriarchy within all the homes of the country. By playing on their fetishes and with the right philosophy, women learned to control their men and, eventually, brought men to their knees. In time, women started to gained more and more control.&nbsp; 
With enough women as judges on the Supreme Court, it was declared that male infidelity would result in imprisonment for the men who would cheat on their wives.&nbsp; If they were caught, they would loose everything to the woman. That is when the male chastity belt became very popular in order to control of the male orgasms. By controlling their dicks, women would be controlling their men.
That way, women took over the households of America. The same change occurred in Canada. A few years later, similar laws were passed in Europe. Within a generation, women became leaders and queens of their own homes. They gained more and more political power and confidence. A worldwide peace treaty was signed so there could be no more wars. A strong sense of solidarity brought them to the top of every field of society. Those who were in power finished the job by hiring more women than men in key-position jobs. In time, they replaced the old, unorganized male guard and took over the most important men's jobs.&nbsp; 
They worked to undermine every effort of the male resistance until the White House was led by 60% of women. On April 14th, 1985, they passed the "Solonas Act", which made it illegal for a man to have a job superior to that of a woman. Men were banned from colleges and universities as well. It was also decided that all positions of power would be held only by women. Within the marriage, men were to pledge fidelity and obedience to their wives. Physical punishment was permitted to any male that displeased his wife. Women learned how to use the bullwhip. Men were forbidden to fight. In time, all martial arts schools were closed. A new fighting program was created, regrouping the best of all combat styles. The idea was to learn to defeat a stronger opponent. Only women were permitted to join this course. After a year, all women had to learn how to fight. Men became the weaker gender.
There were manifestations of all kinds everywhere in the country, even riots. Unhappy males were demanding equality and the same rights as


 women but they were ridiculed in public. The majority of males were happy with the way things were. They recognized the superiority of women and supported them to take control. The most were arrested and charged with treason against the New Constitution and the State. 
In 1990, managers, CEOs, school principals, politicians, pilots, astronauts and captains of industry were all women. The police force was 100% women. They were in command of the military as well. All professional sports were among women only. Men were subdued to menial tasks and low- paying jobs. They all had to work, but in all cases their incomes were quite inferior to women's. On television, men were no longer invited as experts to comment on social events. On the sitcoms, they were depicted as inferior beings: openly denigrated, laughed at and considered unable to do a woman's job. Their place was at home to take care of the children, to cook the meals and to clean up the place.&nbsp; The expression �having balls� meant that you had breasts. In other words, it was up to the woman to be the strong one.

The Golden Age began in the year 2000 when slavery was re-established in the New Constitution. Males could be bought and sold by women. The young boys who were growing up were surrounded by women in control. It was only natural to them to accept their places as mere subordinates. The young girls were taught how to lead and to dominate since they were five years old. They would see Mommy bossing Daddy around. The natural order of evolution was taking place.

Nathasha was born on the same day women passed the "Solonas Act". She was quite proud of it. She was born into a world led by women for women. At home as well as on the outside world, she came to see men as sexual objects to be controlled and humiliated. They had no more rights and that was quite alright.

When she took her place on the bus, she saw Richard sitting in the back seat. She was very fond of him. He was good-looking, not much taller than her, about 5'7, nice black hair and a cute face. She liked to slap him so much because of it. Since the fourth grade, she had been torturing him constantly. She liked to tease him to such a point that teachers had to put a stop to her harassment. She used to ride him like a pony in the school recreational area. She lost count of how many times she practiced her fighting skills on him. Making him fall or pushing him against the wall or on the floor was common. She had him beg for mercy more than once. One day, Nathasha decided to spit in his face for fun. After a couple of times, he felt he had more than enough. He tried to punch her in the nose, but she dodged it easily and slammed him on the ground like he was a puppet. She stood over him with a closed fist. 
"Wanna try that again?" she asked.
"No! Please Nathasha, don't hurt me, please!" 
He learned that day that a male wasn't permitted to hit a female under any circumstance. Richard was born male and raised as one. He had to take the pain and learn his place. Even his parents never complained about


 Nathasha's harassment of their son. When they learned of the incident at school, Richard mom called Nathasha's mother and apologized to her. 
"He's been warned. Next time he fights back, she can punch him if she wants to."
For them, it was just fun and games and Richard had to learn to be submissive to girls. Nathasha's mother was grateful for richard's parents attitude, but she wanted to be sure he would never try to hit her girl again. 
At Nathasha's 16th birthday, richard was invited to the party. What he didn't know is that he was also to be her birthday present. Nathasha got her first bullwhip that day and richard would be the whipping post. They grabbed him when he least expected him and tied him up to a pole. Nathasha's mother taught her everything she knew about how to whip a man. 
For richard, it was the most humiliating day of his life. For Nathasha, it was the day she had her first orgasm.

There was fear in his eyes when she sat beside him. As usual, she rested her feet on his lap. richard didn't complain. 
He had no right to. 
"What's wrong with you, jerk?" she asked. Richard's head was in the clouds.
She grabbed him by the hair and shook his head.
"Hey! Moron! I'm talking to you!" 
"Excuse me, Nathasha. I guess I'm not completely out of bed this morning."
"I see what you mean. I don't like school any more than you do."
The bus arrived. As usual, the girls came out first. The boys had to wait until they were all out. Then they could go.
Nathasha waited outside for Richard to get out.&nbsp; 
"What's your first class this morning?" she asked.
"Hand washing techniques. And yours?"
"Chemistry."&nbsp; 
"Chemistry? I always wondered what is it you learn in that course."
"You'll never know, will you? You males are lucky. You don't have to learn all this stuff."
"Maybe I could if I was permitted to."
"Are you kidding?" Nathasha laughed. "You're a boy, Richard. You just don't have the genes for it," she said by pulling his ear. 
Once inside the building, Nathasha went to her locker. Her best friend, Cynthia, was there. 
"What's new?" she asked. Cynthia showed her a leather collar with a plaque with her name on it.
"I'm gonna ask him today!" she said, very excited.
"You want to go out with Jeff? I thought he was still with Clara!"
"Not anymore! She dumped him for Mike! That means Jeff is free!" she said with a big smile.
Nathasha looked at the collar she was holding in her hand. "Not free for very long." On this, they both laughed. They knew Jeff couldn't refuse to go out with her. A boy refusing to go out with any girl is severely frowned upon. 


It could get him into trouble. 
"What do you think I should do? Ask him directly or get behind him and put on the collar before he knows it's already locked on him?"
"Whatever you want. Does it matter? I've never let any guy saying 'no' to me."
"Of course not, silly. Look at you! You're a goddess! All the boys in this school would kill their own mother just to be led on a leash by you!" 
"True!" Nathasha said with a big grin on her face.
As they were laughing again, Jeff was passing by, uncollared. Nathasha snapped her fingers in front of his face.
"Hey, Jeff! Come here, boy. Wanna talk to you."
Jeff obeyed.&nbsp; 
"Hello Nathasha. Wow! You look so sexy in those leather pants! You're amazing!"
"Ah, you don't say? What about Cynthia here? She's got something to tell you." Jeff turned to Cynthia to say hello. 
Then he saw what he was holding in her hand.
"So, Jeff, what do you think? You'd like to be my boyfriend for a while?" 
"Oh, Cyn! You're so silly sometimes! Here. Let me show you. Jeff? Get down on your knees!"
Jeff looked embarrassed but obeyed Nathasha's order. While Cynthia was getting behind Jeff to put her collar around his neck, Nathasha was holding Jeff's head up by raising his chin. Cynthia locked the collar and put the key on her necklace. The she came back to face Jeff. Nathasha was still holding Jeff's chin up. She was now moving his head from left to right to see if Cynthia's collar was well-adjusted.
"Oh! Look at him! He's so cute, huh?" she said. 
"You bet!" Cynthia retorted. "Nice piece of meat if you ask me." Both girls started to laugh. Jeff was red with shame but he was 'taking it like a man', which means he didn't say a word and waited for orders. Cynthia looked at him, hands on hips. 
"What should I do with him now?" 
"Don't ask me. Do whatever you want. He's yours now, remember?" Nathasha said by touching Jeff's collar.
"Nice leather."&nbsp; 
"You can say that." Cynthia said. "It's the same my mother used to ask my father to marry her."
Jeff's eyes showed panic when he heard the word "marry�. He had always found Cynthia attractive but certainly not enough to be forced to marry her. On the other hand, he would give a lung to be Nathasha's plaything.
"Stand up, boy!" Cynthia said. "To show the whole school you're now my property, you'll be following me two steps behind around the corridors. I want everyone to know you're mine now." 
"Yes, Cynthia," said Jeff with sadness in his voice. Cynthia heard it. She was about to slap him hard in the face for not showing more enthusiasm, but she didn't want to look like she wasn't in control of him in front of Nathasha. 



"Come on!" she ordered Jeff as she went on. Jeff glanced at Nathasha, and from the look in his eyes she knew it was her that he wanted to follow like
a dog on a leash, not Cynthia.
"Too bad" she thought to herself. "He had a nice butt."

Nathasha was heading for her chemistry class when she met her friends along the way. Males were all in uniform - Tight white t-shirts that were showing the males&#8217; tits and pale grey nylon pants. These pants didn't look very fashionable but they showed up to be quite fun when a girl wants to pull down a boy's pants to play with his dick or to slap his butt.&nbsp; 
Along the corridors, most of the males where talking to themselves or heading for class, but a few of them were on their knees, waiting for their girlfriends to ask permission to go to the bathroom or such thing. One girl was sitting on her boyfriend's back as if he was a pony. Another one was slapping hers for some reason and one boy was tying up his girlfriend's shoes.
"Hurry up, you idiot! I have to be in the gym in five minutes!" she said to him. 

A normal day at school.

Nathasha got into class as everyone did.&nbsp; The boys were learning what they had to learn in this society led by women -&nbsp; the house chores, servicing women and how to obey. The girls, on the other hand, were learning the sciences. They were taught how to rule the world. Nathasha didn't like school but she knew she was blessed. She didn't have to learn how to scrub a bath or to clean up a floor. That was a man's job. 
As a woman, her job was different. She would find herself the perfect mate and tell him when to do it. 





&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part 2&nbsp; -&nbsp; Home, sweet home&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nathasha just got home from school. She was glad the week was over. She was looking forward to enjoy her week-end with her friends. The rain was pouring outside but this was only for this evening.&nbsp; The next fews days were going to be sunny, according to the weather forecast. 
She walked through the kitchen but no one was there. She dumped her books on the couch in the living room, took off her black leather jacket and sat on the lazy boy. To her surprise, her father didn't seem to be present. This was an unusual situation since he couldn't leave the house unless given permission. Perhaps he just didn't hear her coming in. Usually, the sounds of her steps on the kitchen floor is enough to let him know she's home. She rested her booted feet on the small table in front of her and picked up the remote to change the channel to her favorite TV sitcom, "Mom's the boss". Her knee-high boots were still dripping from the rain.&nbsp; 
 
 
Her father Daniel was in the basement, wearing only a thong and sandals. He was a 40 year old man, short brown hair, brown eyes, 5"8 and in athletic shape. His wife Felicia would have never allowed him to gain one ounce of fat. She kept him on a strict diet at all times. He was busy shining the English-style riding boots of his wife when he heard the theme of "Mom's the boss" from the living room. He walked up the stairs and saw the wet steps she left with her boots on the kitchen's floor. He knew his daughter was home.&nbsp; 
 "Hello, dear!&nbsp; How are you? Was it a good day at school? 
 "Dad?&nbsp; Where were you? I didn't see you when I came in." 
 "I was in the basement, shining your mother's boots. Do you want anything?" 
 "Yeah. Get me a soda, will ya?" 
 "Of course." 
 Daniel picked up a can of Sado-Soda from the fridge and gave it to her daughter. She didn't even look at him and she drank directly from it.&nbsp; 
She knew her father had already opened the can for her. As usual, she never said thanks.&nbsp; 
 "Looks like it's now raining outside, huh? I wonder if..." 
 "Shut up! I'm watching this!" she interrupted him.&nbsp; 
 "I'm sorry." he said, lowering his head. 
 Nathasha kept her eyes on the screen and dismissed her father with a wave of the hand. Daniel picked up the mop in the kitchen to clean the stains his daughter had left on the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
A moment later, his wife arrived from the office.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Daniel? Have you finished shining my boots?"&nbsp; 
 "Yes, Honey. Would you like to inspect them?" 
 "Later," she said, giving him her suitcase. I'm glad I'm not too late for the show."

 Felicia was 45 years old, 5"6, long black hair, green eyes and a nice silhouette. She was wearing a red jacket with a white shirt. Her skirt was in 
red leather, cutted just above the knees. Just like Nathasha, she walked through the kitchen with her red leather boots on without giving a damn about 
the floor her husband had just cleaned again. She picked up a can of beer from the fridge and joined her daughter in the living room. 
"Hi Mom!" 
"Hi Sweetie. Did I miss much?" 
"Not really. The show's just begun. Marcy just told her son he might be castrated if his school grades were not satisfactory." 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both women looked at each other and laughed. This new show was the most popular on television alongside another comedy show from the 80's,&nbsp; "Kill the guy with the balls". Marcy, the main character of "Mom's the boss", was played by Brooke Shields. She had won an Emmy two years in a row for that role.&nbsp; 
"How was work?" Nathasha asked.&nbsp; 
"The Vice-President of our department will be leaving for vacation to the Bahamas next week. She said I have a good chance of replacing her while she'll be gone."

 
"A promotion?" 
Felicia smiled. "Could be! What about you? How was school today?"&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Nothing special.&nbsp; Except maybe that Cynthia asked Jeff to go out with her. She collared him and led him on a leash all afternoon. The poor guy can't even go to the boys&#8217; room without her permission anymore." 
"I was doing the same with your father when I met him. I kept him�on a tight leash�, if you know what I mean. Seems good for Cynthia, though.&nbsp; Jeff is so submissive. I'm sure she'll have him do whatever she wants." 
"I guess so," answered Nathasha. 
"Is something wrong? Is it because you don't have a boyfriend too?" 
"No. Everything's fine. It's just that I haven't found the right one I guess." 
"Guys have been crawling at your feet since you were five. What more could you want to make you happy?" 
"I'd like a guy who would know how to lick a decent pair of boots," she said while looking at the pair she was wearing, still wet from the rain. "That's what I want."&nbsp; 
They both busted in laugher. 
"Oh! You're so cruel, Nath!" Felicia said, playfully pushing her daughter further in the lazy boy. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daniel was done cleaning the kitchen floor and entered the living room. He couldn't help to see the few drops of rain on the living room table where Nathasha had kept her booted feet since she arrived. During the commercial, he politely asked her if she would mind moving her feet a bit so he could clean the table with a napkin. She raised her feet in the air so he could proceed just to place them on his back. Daniel realized he had been the victim of a practical joke. Her mother was giggling. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My next boyfriend should be like Dad. What do you think, Mom?" she said with a grin. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get yourself another male," Felicia said. "This one's mine!" she added with a smile. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry. I intend to find one to my liking very soon."&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 As Daniel had finished cleaning the table, Nathasha playfully kicked him in the ass. Poor daddy almost fell on the floor, much to the delight of both women who were laughing at him. Then Nathasha rested her booted feet on the table again.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"If the table gets dirty again, I'll let you know," she said with a smile.&nbsp; 
"Thank you," Daniel answered meekly and Felicia slapped the butt of her husband before letting him leave the living room, red with shame.&nbsp; 
"Men!" said Nathasha. "They're so low!" she said with a laugh. 
"I guess that's part of their charm." said Felicia. "You have to learn to appreciate what we can do with them." 
"I know, Mom. You know I'm just kidding. I like males too, you know. They're so easy."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, the commercial of the Disciplinarian Guards on the television screen. Nathasha jumped off her seat.
"Mom! It's them!"
Nathasha looked at the commercial and it seemed like nothing could


 take her eyes off the screen. You could see a group of women, all dressed in their black leather uniforms, flying on their hovercycles. They were surrounding a man who was trying to escape. They threw an electrified net at him. The last image of the ad was a woman standing proud on top of him with her boot on his face. 
"Someday, that's gonna be me!" she said.
"And they&#8217;re paying very well...as long as you can be good enough to join them."
"Don't worry about it. This is senior year. Once I'm free, I'm joining them!" she said, confident. 
"I'm sure you'll make it, Princess. That's because you always had the touch. Remember the way you treated Peter, you own brother? He's five years older than you and at 12, you used to tie him up in the backyard. I had to untie him several times a day because you didn't want to let him go to the shopping mall with you." 
"I wanted him to come to the mall with me," argued Nathasha. 
"Come on, Nath! You wanted to lead him on a leash like a dog," her mom said, covering her smile with her hand.
"That's because you never bought us a real dog! I had to do with what I had. Besides, I tied him up only because he resisted the leash!" 
"That was wrong of you to do so, even if he was your older brother," Felicia said, shaking her head but still smiling. 
"Did you ever tell me not to tie him?" said Nathasha as she crossed her arms.
"No, but that's because he never complained too much about it." 
"Ah! He never complained too much about it because he knew I would squeeze his balls if he told you anything."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your brother never told me that." said her mother, surprised.
 "That's because he knew what it felt like when I was squeezing his balls. How do you think I managed at 12 year old to tie my 17 year old brother to the backyard fence?" 





&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part 3 &#8211; Dark Angels in the night


&nbsp; Nathasha always loved Saturday nights.&nbsp; It was her favourite time to party. A few calls from her friends confirmed they would all be at 10 PM at their favourite bar, the Moreski. It wasn't just a party night in perspective. She knew there would be a lot of fun...and a lot of action the way she liked it.
&nbsp; Nathasha was good at keeping secrets. That's why no one in her family knew she was the&nbsp; member of a gang called the "Dark Angels".&nbsp; Except for her and Cynthia who were at their senior year in High School, this group was formed of 2 other girls from college. Despite the fact that she was the youngest, she was the leader of the gang. She was looking forward to see them and she was feeling particularly bitchy that evening.
&nbsp; After taking a shower, she dried her hair and arranged it in a pony tail. She put on a bit of make-up and dressed in her black PVC catsuit. She put on her thigh-high leather boots, a studded belt and attached a teaser gun on it. She put on her black motorcycle gloves and her favourite leather cap.&nbsp; She picked up her black leather perfecto but kept it unzipped and then she looked at herself in the mirror. She was stunning. She took her bullwhip in a bag with her.
She went down the stairs and found her mother and father watching TV.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mom? I'm going out for the evening. I don't know when I'll be back."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's alright, dear. Enjoy yourself!" said her mother. "By the way, you look pretty hot tonight!"
 Daniel looked at her daughter dressed so kinky. Despite the feeling of intimidation he always felt from her since she started to dress that way at 14, he was very much aroused to see her looking so sexy.&nbsp; Yet he always tried to hide his attraction.&nbsp; He too was good at keeping secrets. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you going to take the car this evening, Nathasha?" he asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course I'm taking Mom's car. Why?"
Daniel turned to Felicia.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Peter begged you all week long to let him use the car for today. He's supposed to see his own friends this evening. Don't you remember?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn! You're right. I completely forgot. Well, if Nathasha wants the car, we have to tell him. Where is he now?" she asked.
Nathasha opened the door and found Peter opening the garage door.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's okay! I found him!" and on this, she closed the door and headed for Peter.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Felicia, you promised Peter he could have the car this evening." said Daniel.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know but I forgot to ask Nathasha first if she wanted to use it too. In any case, let her handle it with her brother." she said, bouncing her shoulders.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you think it's kinda unfair? After you, she was always the first to pick up everything she ever wanted. Why don't you give the boys a chance?"&nbsp; Felicia smiled. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it my fault if girls can drive cars at 16 and boys only at 21? I don't make the laws in this country." 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it's not, but it's always women who make decisions for everything and you know what the score is."
&nbsp;&nbsp; "So?" asked Felicia. "The reason why women are in charge is because men are incapable to be in charge. You know as well as I the lessons of history. You just don't have the mind for it.&nbsp; I guess that's why your physically stronger. Males are fit for menial work.&nbsp; That's why women are in charge of society and men stay at home."
Daniel heard that argument all his life. First at home, then at school and now at home. But he knew he couldn't argue with the facts of life. In time, history became "herstory" and men came to accept female leadership. When he heard how the New Constitution would permit women to enslave unruly males, he knew there would never be equality between the gender. The strong sex would always dominate the other and males would always be the weaker sex.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nature can be so unfair!" he said.
 Felicia noticed Daniel's frustration in his voice. She looked directly at her husband.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay then!&nbsp; Shut up and go to sleep!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But Felicia!&nbsp; It's only 9:25 PM!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, Daniel!" she said in a stern tone.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Felicia. As you wish." he meekly said. She was still looking at him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Listen...uh...I'm sorry...I didn't mean to..."
 Felicia snapped her fingers, interrupting her husband. She pointed her finger to the bedroom and in silence, Daniel turned around and went to bed. At this point, he knew this was the best way to behave. If he would disobey his wife, she could take off her belt and beat him like a dog.&nbsp; He remembered the bruises she left all over his body the last time he argued with her and he didn't want to be punished again. 
Like a good husband to his wife, Daniel went to bed quite early that evening.&nbsp; If he was lucky, he'd still have a chance to sleep in her bed instead of on the floor.

&nbsp; As Peter was taking the car out of the garage, he saw his sister Nathasha blocking his path in the driveway. At her request, he lowered the window.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm taking the car tonight."
Peter was shocked. "But Mom told me I could have it this evening!" he protested.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Didn't you heard what I said? Asked Nathasha calmly. "I said get out of the car, Pete. If you hurry, you can take the bus to go to see your little friends. Otherwise, you'll just have to walk. Makes no difference to me."
Peter opened the door and stoop up to his sister.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She promised!" he said.
&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then go talk to her. You know what she's gonna say."
Peter knew the battle was lost in advance. Nathasha smiled and rubbed her gloved hand in her brother's hair. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good boy!" she said to him as if he was a dog who just brought her back the stick she threw at him. Nathasha got inside the car. Peter asked her 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Could you at least give me a lift?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked at her brother, surprised, then laughed at him. She engaged the engine without even looking back at him while he was heading toward the bus stop. Unfortunately for him, he saw the bus passing him by. Nathasha saw the whole scene as he tried to catch the bus and laughed again.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; "Poor little boy" she taught. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; "He's gonna have to cut his evening if he doesn't want to be late."&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Besides, men shouldn't have the right to drive anyway." she said to herself with a smile. 



&nbsp; Nathasha arrived a bit early at the bar.&nbsp; A group of people were waiting in line to get in but she recognized no one among them. Lucky for her, they were all males. She got in front of the line without any problems and the door woman let her in immediately. It's a permanent ladies'night in town. Women don't wait in line like men do. Not only Nathasha never had to pay to get in but with her look, she never had to pay for her drinks either.&nbsp; All she needed to do is tell one of the guys at the bar to get her what she wanted and the poor sap would feel privileged to have been chosen for getting something to her.&nbsp; She was a woman in a female-dominated society. If the guy would refused, she would just signal the door women to take the guy out and they would do it with a kick in the ass without even asking him his version of the story.&nbsp; Her mother always saw men as a commodity. Nathasha, on the other hand, saw them more like playthings, toys to play with. Their opinions, likes or wishes were irrelevant.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She's here!" said a tall blonde girl at the bar pointing at Nathasha. Her name was Emily. She was 20 year old, 5"9 and in great shape. She was one of the Dark Angels. She was wearing a military outfit with combat boots and a black hat. Two other girls were with her. Jan was the brunette with brown eyes, same age as Emily, 5"5, dressed with an American flag bomber leather jacket and tight black leather pants with knee-high laced boots. Cynthia was the other girl.&nbsp; Naturally a blonde, she had tainted her long hair in red. She was wearing a black � coat and tight black jeans with ankle boots. Jeff was with her in his school uniform. He was still wearing Cynthia's collar. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hi girls! You're ready to have some fun tonight?" joyfully asked Nathasha.
&nbsp;&nbsp; "I got all that I need!" said Emily with a large smile, showing white nylon ropes from a black and green bag at her feet.&nbsp; Jeff didn't understand why Emily was bringing ropes with her.&nbsp; Cynthia never bother to tell him he wasn't going to follow them after they'd leave the bar.&nbsp; Besides, he was just too busy looking at Nathasha. It was the first time he saw her wearing a PVC catsuit. A bulge in his pants was proof enough how much he was crazy about her.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hi, Jeff!" she casually said to him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Nathasha. You really look hot tonight!" he said. Cynthia gave him a hard look. He knew he had just made a mistake. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Follow me!" she said to him. He lowered his head and follow her to the boys'room. As a girl, she was permitted to do so. On the other hand, males were strictly forbidden to enter the women's room. Females had the right to their privacy.
&nbsp; Once alone with him, she slapped him hard.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How dare you look at another girl?&nbsp; I told you; don't speak to anyone in my presence unless spoken to!"&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm sorry, Cynthia, but it was Nathasha who spoke first and..."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You didn't have to say she's hot, you idiot! Everybody knows she's hot! She's been told she's hot since the first grade! You think she doesn't know it by now? She doesn't need an asshole like you to tell her how obvious it is!" She slapped him&nbsp; again, back and forth this time.&nbsp; Jeff was red with shame, unable to defend himself. He lowered his head, unwilling to look at Cynthia in the eyes. He knew she could see it as a sign of provocation.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"I want you to keep your mouth shut, got it? You'll talk when I'll allow you to say something!"&nbsp; Jeff nodded in understanding. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Any question?" she asked him. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, yes. It's about the collar."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about it?"&nbsp; She said, her hands on her hips.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You made me wear it since school and it's kinda tight. It's an inch high and I'm not used to it."
 Cynthia rolled her eyes.&nbsp; She remembered Nathasha telling her how well adjusted it was.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's the point, silly. You have to get used to it. This is the same collar every man is wearing when they have a girlfriend or when they're married. The slaves have the same, except it's made of unbreakable metal. Your's in leather, so don't complain...or else."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you mean, 'or else'?" She grabbed him by his T-shirt. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It means I'll get you a irremovable metal collar and I'll make sure it's even tighter than this one. Capish?"
Jeff didn't want to answer but from the look in his eyes, Cynthia knew he understood her.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One more thing, Jeff..." she said. Jeff was feeling so powerless in front of her that he was ready to accept anything to make sure she wouldn't get angry at him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, dear?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want you to go home now.&nbsp; The girls and I are going for a walk this evening. I'll call you in 30 minutes to make sure you're home. And as for the collar, it's stays, got it? Just get used to it!"&nbsp; He nodded again. On this, she kissed him passionately. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You'll see, Jeff. Once I'm done training you, we'll be happy together."

&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Jeff left, the four girls headed for the park.&nbsp; However, this wasn't just any walk in the park.&nbsp; Led by Nathasha, the girls were looking for action.&nbsp; They walked along the canal for about a kilometre until they reached the old bridge.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under female domination, many males who were considered ugly, unfit, reckless or&nbsp; undisciplined were categorized as "outcasts".&nbsp; They were the homeless beggars, unable to find a job and since no women wanted to do anything with them, their situation was hopeless.
In other realities, this would not have been be a safe place for women to walk by. In this world however, it is the males who aren't safe as groups of young girls like the Dark Angels were "looking for action".
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Angels were having fun, telling jokes and laughing on funny anecdotes when Nathasha saw a young boy, a 13 year old, looking for food in a dumpster. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, you!" she yelled at him.&nbsp; He turned around to look at the girls. There was fear in his eyes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, you, boy! I'm talking to you! Come here! I want to see you!" she said to him. The boy remained silent. When he saw Nathasha coming his way, he got scared and started to run.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get him!" shouted Nathasha. The girls spreaded in the night to catch the boy. Obviously, this was the promising evening they were dreaming about.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy was running as fast as he could but against girls older and in much better shape than he was, he didn't stand a chance.&nbsp; Emily was getting closer to him. 

&nbsp; Jan was right behind her, followed by Cynthia. The three girls were converging to his position but Nathasha was out of sight.&nbsp; Suddenly, as the boy was attempting to reach a row of shrubs to hide, Nathasha appeared in front of him, slashing her whip in the air. 
The boy screamed in fear and turn around only to face Emily who was only two steps behind him. He turned right and ended up in front of Jan who grabbed him by his coat and pushed his back on a tree. Emily grabbed him by the neck to hold him still.&nbsp; Cynthia arrived a second later.&nbsp; Nathasha was quietly walking to the boy with a smile on her face as she was holding the bullwhip. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where were you going, boy?"
The boy was too scared to answer. Emily was still holding him by the neck and Jan was searching in his pocket. She found $10 on him and kept it for herself. Not that she needed the money. Her mother was a cop and was giving her daughter $100 a week in allowance. It's just that Jan, just like her friends, were willing to play the "bad girls" tonight.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; "Answer!" shouted Emily while slapping the boy.&nbsp; The poor little guy just wanted to go but the Angels had captured their prey and they didn't want to let him go so easily.
&nbsp;&nbsp; "Answer to her when she's talking to you!" said Jan while showing Nathasha who was two feet away from the boy.
&nbsp;&nbsp; "What were you looking for in that dumpster, boy? Something to eat?"
&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy nodded. He had trouble breathing after such a race and Emily's grip didn't make it any easier for him to do so.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why didn't you come when I called you? Why are you disobedient when we give you an order?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the first time, the boy started to speak. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please, let me go, Ma'am. I haven't done anything wrong!"&nbsp; Nathasha smiled.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You made us run after you, little jerk. For that, you must pay."&nbsp; The girls were exchanging looks of complicity. They were enjoying themselves a lot at the expense of this young male.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should we do to him?" asked Cynthia. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We could tie him up to that tree. I brought ropes." Emily suggested.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let him go." said Nathasha to the surprise of the others.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But why?" Jan asked. "We got one. Let's play with him."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let him go." repeated Nathasha. "I want him to apologized on his knees for not obeying us when we told him to come."&nbsp; The girls smiled broadly.&nbsp; Obviously, Nathasha was a great leader.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will let you go, boy, but only if you do what we say, got it?" said Emily to the boy as she was still holding him by the neck. The boy acquiesced.&nbsp; As soon as she let go, Nathasha pointed to the ground. The boy was a bit hesitant but he was too afraid of them to resist. He&nbsp;&nbsp; looked at Nathasha who was caressing her whip and he knelt down to her. The girls were giggling. Nathasha pointed further more to the tips of her boots. The boy bowed down completely to her, at her feet. The girls started to laugh. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! Nath! You're so bad!" said Jan. Nathasha was laughing too. She was getting all wet between her legs. While the other girls were finding this amusing, she was getting excited.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "See? It's not so difficult to obey, isn't it, boy?" asked Nathasha with a smile.&nbsp; Jan placed her booted foot on the boy's back.&nbsp; The boy was too humiliated to answer. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We should still tie him to a tree." said Emily. Nathasha didn't answer. She was too aroused by the boy's humiliation to listen to what her friend was saying.
&nbsp; Then, suddenly, they heard a man yelling at them.

&nbsp; "Leave him alone, you fucking bitches! Let him go!" the man shouted.&nbsp; Just by the looks of it, he was a homeless too.&nbsp; He was about 65 years old, grey hair, unshaved, dressed in rags and holding a cane in the air. He was trying to run as fast as he can to save the boy from those girls. Cynthia turned to Nathasha who wasn't impressed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hold him." she said to Jan about the boy.&nbsp; As he was still down on his knees, she got behind him and locked his arm behind his back. The boy didn't even know someone could do that. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want, you dipshit?" said Nathasha while confidently walking toward the old man.&nbsp; Emily was now walking right besides her. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old man was still yelling at them. "You fucking little bitches! How dare you take on a small boy like that!" he screamed. Once he got close enough, he tried to hit Nathasha with his cane. Nathasha dodged his blow and blocked his arm with her hand. She then kick the old man in the groin with her knee.&nbsp; The man dropped his cane on the ground. He couldn't run or yell anymore but he was still standing.&nbsp; Emily used a Kung-Fu technique to kick him in the face and he fell down on the ground with a bloody mouth, holding his nuts in his hands. Cynthia picked up the old man's cane and kick him in the back with it.&nbsp; The girls started to laugh again. Then they heard the young boy screaming.
&nbsp; "No! Please! Don't hurt my father! Please!" 
&nbsp; "This old piece of shit is your dad? Really?" asked Jan, amused. Emily pulled the old man's legs out so he would rest flat on his belly.&nbsp; Nathasha saw that. She walked to him and stepped on him. It was hilarious. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; "You're right, you old shit! We shouldn't take it on the boy. We should take it on you instead, right, girls?" said Nathasha.
&nbsp;&nbsp; "You got that right! Answered Emily with enthusiasm. 
&nbsp; The boy was trying to escape from Jan's lock but she wouldn't let go. In fact, she was truly enjoying herself. 
&nbsp; The old man was trying to catch his breath. Nathasha was resting her foot on the back of his head. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; "Looks like the father is in need of proper education, just like the boy does." she said while adding more pressure on the back of his head just to make it worse. She was clearly enjoying herself. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; "He could had least say "thanks" for showing him and his little brat her how to behave." said Jan sarcastically.
&nbsp;&nbsp; "No manners, huh?" said Emily as a joke. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We'll take them under the bridge. I want to see what they're hiding in their pile of crap."
&nbsp; Obeying their leader, Jan picked up the boy while Emily and Cynthia brought the old man to his feet. He was still bleeding from the mouth so Nathasha spat in his face a few times and wiped out the blood from his beard with her gloved hand. The girls found it hilarious. 
&nbsp; The Angels brought the two homeless under the bridge where the boy showed them where they were sleeping at night.&nbsp; As they got close, half a dozen homeless men showed up and headed toward Nathasha.&nbsp; They didn't know she wasn't alone. They only saw her as an intruder on their territory.&nbsp; 


&nbsp; Nathasha walked to them without hesitation. Once she got about 20 feet from them, she took her whip and began cracking it in front of them. They turned around in fear and ran like rats. She felt the urge to run after them and catch at least another one but they already had caught two this evening. When the others arrived, they saw them running away.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; "Shall we run after them?" asked Emily.
&nbsp; "Maybe another day. We have those two for tonight. Let's see what we got here."
&nbsp; The males were brought to their knees while the girls started searching for any goods of value in their junk. This was worse than crap. There was empty bottles everywhere, which Jan and Cynthia took pleasure at throwing on the walls, dirty clothes which Emily set on fire just for the fun of it. Nathasha found some coins which she dropped one by one in the sewer in front of the old man while he was begging her to stop. In less than five minutes, the Angels destroyed all the man had in this world. Since the other homeless ran away at the sight of Nathasha, the search everything under the bridge. Emily found another homeless man under a pile of old newspaper and she kicked him out of there.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; The old man, unable to sustain such humiliation any longer, stood up and tried to stop Jan from looking at some old pictures the man had. Before he could make one step, Nathasha pulled out her teaser gun and hit him in the back. The man fell again at her feet. The boy was in tears.
&nbsp; "I'll find you a better place than this, boy. You're mine now." she said to him.
&nbsp; Once everything was pillaged or burn, Nathasha asked Emily to attach the rope around the boy's neck. They brought him with them outside the park.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; They walked toward Chelsey Hills while laughing about the fun they had with the homeless tonight. They arrived at a large house painted in red. It was the bureau of the Disciplinarian Corps. The girls got in with the boy on leash. Inside the office, no one paid attention to any of it. Nathasha went to the front office as the girls went to the ladies room except for Jan who was guarding the young boy.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello. My name is Jennifer. What can I do for you?"
&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hi! My name is Nathasha and we "found" this young boy on the street. He's homeless. I was wondering what you could give me for him."
&nbsp; Both women started to negotiate. First they had to be sure the boy was really a homeless child. How many times some girls from gangs like the Dark Angels kidnapped young boys to sell them to the state while they already had a home. They just couldn't take into account a male boy's testimony. Jennifer asked her his name.
&nbsp; She realized she didn't even ask for his name. It didn't really matter, though.&nbsp; From now on, the boy would become the property of the State. He'd be given a number and would be forced to work as a slave in the mines or some other place a woman in charge of him would assign him. All they had to do was to verify the value of the boy they were holding.
&nbsp; Jennifer picked up the phone and asked for a doctor to come to the front office.
&nbsp; A moment later, Nathasha asked Jan to bring the boy to her.
&nbsp; "So?" asked Jan.
&nbsp; "They're going to check him out." said Nathasha.
A woman dressed in white untied the boy and took him for a medical examination. In the meantime, Jennifer made the official verification. Half and hour later, the boy was taken by a soldier woman and brought upstairs. He was scared but very submissive. 
Nathasha was called to the front office again. 

&nbsp; A few minutes later, she came back to the others who were waiting for her in the hall.
&nbsp; "And?" asked Emily.
&nbsp; "$400. That makes $100 for each of us!" Nathasha said with a smile. The girls were thrilled.
&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wow! It's great!" said Cynthia when Nathasha gave her her cut.
&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about his father? What about all of the others for that matters? Would they give us some cash for them too? We still have time!" asked Emily.
&nbsp;&nbsp; "No. They said they were too old for the reform program. But the young male we caught today will do just fine they said."

&nbsp; Right as they were about to leave, Jennifer asked to talk to Nathasha in private.
&nbsp; "I won't be long, girls. Can you wait outside?"
&nbsp; The others agreed. 

&nbsp; "I think you're the leader of that group, aren't you?" asked Jennifer.
&nbsp; "That's right. We're the Dark Angels. We're spending a lot of time together."
&nbsp; " I see." said Jennifer. 
&nbsp; "Something's wrong?" asked Nathasha.
&nbsp; "No. Not at all. It's just that I noticed you name on our information list here at the Disciplinarian Corps. Is it because you would like to join our ranks someday, when your senior year in High School will be over?"
&nbsp; Nathasha's heart was pounding. She was thrilled to answer Jennifer about it.
&nbsp; "Yes...yes...I would like that very much!"
&nbsp; Jennifer smiled.
&nbsp; "That's great. For your community service today, we can give you some extra points. All you have to do is sign here. If you ever come for a job, this could help you with your credentials."
&nbsp; For Nathasha, this was amazingly wonderful. She was receiving extra credits even before she could join the Corps.
&nbsp; "Thank you so much!" she said to Jennifer after signing the form.
&nbsp; "Thanks to you, Nathasha.&nbsp; You will make a fine element to our group. See you then!"
&nbsp; 
&nbsp; Nathasha was thrilled beyond belief. Not only she enjoyed a great evening with her friends by taking on those worthless animals in the park but she was being rewarded for it. And she had made $100 bucks on top of that! 
&nbsp; She was also glad this information was to remain confidential. She knew her mother would not approve of her taking risks like that. If only she could really know how men are defenceless. Haven't she lived with dad long enough?

Before she was going to rejoin her friends outside, Jennifer came to her again.
&nbsp; "Oh! Nathasha?"
&nbsp; "Yes?"
&nbsp; "I just wanted to say...your outfit...it's really hot!&nbsp; You look great!"
&nbsp; Nathasha smiled.
&nbsp; "I know."






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part 4 &#8211; A way of life



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Look! Mom! They're talking about the Volvia scandal!" said Nathasha.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Felicia arrived just in time to see the report on the news.&nbsp; She had followed this story since the beginning.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Volvia scandal was about a porn movie company owned by a multi-millionaire woman known only as "Empress Alicia".&nbsp; She was responsible for abducting male models around the world to force them to perform sex in her porn movies.&nbsp; The models were locked in cages in the basement of her studios.&nbsp; They were fed only vitamins supplements and steroids. They were forced by women to train several hours a day in order to keep their shape for the movies.&nbsp; Empress Alicia made most of her money from this practice and was now found guilty for holding these men as prisoners. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During the trial, the models were not asked to testify. The judge saw no need for it since they were all in good shape. She concluded that Empress Alicia acted in the best interest of the company's investors. She was allowed to keep the males as slaves but only if they had no family member who requested their return.&nbsp; In other word, she kept about half her staff.&nbsp; The other males were set free.
&nbsp; 
&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One of those males was called Greg.&nbsp; He was 27 years old, blond hair with a slim but well-toned body and a nice face.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Felicia and Greg met in a bar after the trial.&nbsp; Once Greg was freed from prison after the trial, he met Felicia and they had been going out together ever since.&nbsp; Daniel was aware of the situation and was trying his best to accept it. After all, if his wife wanted to have sex with another man, he had no say in it.&nbsp; Without her, he would have lived his life on the street and he knew it.
 
&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"So your new flame is one of those guys?" asked Nathasha.
&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yep!" said Felicia. "And he's so cute!" 
&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Mom! These porn guys are little cattle. They're sex objects."
&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I know." giggled Felicia. 
&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh! I see! You really just wanted a plaything! Right?"&nbsp; Both women laughed.
&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"He's coming for dinner. I'll have sex with him tonight. Think of it as my own porn movie."
&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"At home? But I wanted to invite Cynthia to watch a movie."
&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Not to worry. We'll stay in the basement. You can have the living room all to yourselves tonight," assured Felicia.
&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Great!&nbsp; That will give me a chance to introduce you to Jeff, Cynthia's boyfriend."
&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Sounds like fun! What is he like?"
&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well...he's a teenage boy, Mom.&nbsp; Cynthia will use him for awhile and, you know, dump him once she's tired of him." 
&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Are you done yet, Pete?" asked Nathasha, looking down at her brother who had been polishing her boots for the last twenty minutes.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm almost done, Nathasha."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What are you gonna watch with your friends tonight?" Felicia asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Justicia: The Modern Amazon Part 7."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The last Justicia movie?" said Felicia, surprised. "The entire series is about the same thing over and over again?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, sort of" answered Nathasha. She looked at her mother, who clearly would have chosen something else to spend the evening in front of the TV.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I know what you're thinking" said Nathasha. "It's always the same story - A group of men are trying to take over the government and Justicia finds a way to stop them. I know it all but I just can't get enough of it," she said, bouncing her shoulders.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I think you're thinking too much about the Disciplinarian Corps, that's what I think," Felicia said with a wink. "A single woman dressed in sexy latex and armed to the teeth versus a group of male terrorists who fight for equality, and you already know who the winner is? Sound familiar?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathasha laughed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Have you ever seen a movie where the bad guys wins?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Felicia was trying to find an argument to contradict her daughter. Eventually, she came to the same conclusion.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Never."
Peter was almost finished polishing his sister's boots.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I don't see why fighting for equality between genders would be considered terrorism." he said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Was I talking to you?" said Nathasha.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No, but..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"There's no &#8216;buts&#8217; at all. Just keep polishing my boots, will ya?" 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Peter lowered his head and finished his job. He got away just before Nathasha could kick him in the chest. He knew his sister didn't like to be interrupted.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Go clean your sister's room, Peter." Felicia said to her son to punish him.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter was shocked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why? I didn't do anything wrong!" he protested.
"Just do what I said, Peter! Don't argue with me!" Felicia said sternly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nathasha looked at her brother and smiled. Frustrated but defeated, Peter didn't offer any resistance. He lowered his head again and headed for Nathasha's bedroom to clean it up.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nathasha snapped her fingers to get his attention as he was walking in the corridor leading to her room. Peter looked at her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'll be checking on your progress." she said, taunting him.
He clinched his fist in anger but didn't say anything. Nathasha turned to the DVD player to pass the previews on the disc.&nbsp; Right before Peter was about to enter her room, she whispered the phrase:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's it, boy. Go clean up my room, you asshole" 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter heard it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did you say?" he said, angry. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her mother stood up from the couch.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, that's enough!!" 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She turned to Peter.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Peter, go clean your sister's room right now! Did you hear me?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But Mom!" he protested. "She called me an asshole! You heard her!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nathasha started to laugh but Felicia was still angry.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what? That's certainly not the first time your sister has called you an asshole! Now get to work or you'll get the strap! Is that what you want?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nathasha took off her belt from her pants and presented it to her mother.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want this one?" she asked with a grin on her face.
"That's okay, honey." said Felicia to her daughter with a much softer tone. "I got mine already."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter slammed Nathasha's bedroom door behind him. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Felicia yelled at him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Peter! Don't you get mad, boy!" 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind the door, they could hear Peter say "Yes, Mother" in a very subservient tone.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between two laughs, Nathasha yelled to him, "And remember: I'll be checking on your progress... asshole!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter didn't respond.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did you hear what your sister said?" Felicia asked Peter.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter opened the door.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is it, Mother?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nathasha was trying to contain her laughter this time.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was saying: I'll be checking on you, asshole! Did you hear that, asshole?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter was at the end of the corridor, watching his sister laughing at him. His mother was looking at him with a stern look, knowing she would not let him be impolite to his sister for any reason whatsoever.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Nathasha. I'll do a good job. Thank you, Nathasha." he said, humiliated.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very well, asshole. Keep up the good work, asshole!" Nathasha said to him again in front of to Felicia. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She turned to Nathasha and said almost like a whisper. "Give him a break, will ya?" 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nathasha turned back to the TV as Peter was getting back in her room. As Felicia was taking back her place on the couch, Nathasha snapped her fingers at her brother again. He turned to her to see his sister with a big smile, showing him the finger. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get to work, asshole!" she said, bursting in laughter again.
"Would you just stop?" said Felicia, but she couldn't help but laugh too. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter was even more frustrated than before. He took a deep breath and entered the room. This time, he closed the door gently and began cleaning her sister's room despite the humiliation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You're hard on your brother," Felicia said this time on a serious tone.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's okay," said Nathasha with an arrogant smile. "I'll have him apologize to me later."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this very moment, they heard someone knocking at the door. Nathasha stood up and saw Cynthia waving her hand. She opened the door for her and Jeff, who was behind her on a leash. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hi Nath! Hello Ma'am!" 
"Hello Cynthia! Come in!' said Felicia. Cynthia entered, pulling Jeff behind her. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy just saluted the two women with a discreet hand motion.&nbsp; Felicia looked at him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So this is your new boyfriend Nathasha told me about! Well, he's good-looking, isn't it?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Jeff could say anything, Cynthia said: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, he's kinda cute but he's still got a few things to learn," she said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Felicia got closer to him and looked at his collar.
"Nice piece of leather you got there," but she wasn't talking to him. She raised the boy's chin to have a good look.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It was my father's. Jeff is still trying to get used to wear it."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both women were talking about Jeff has if he was an object on display. Nathasha was a few feet behind her mother, looking at him.&nbsp; Jeff couldn't keep his eyes away from her. He noticed she had her belt in her hands and he wondered if she and Cynthia had some sadistic plans for him this evening. By tradition, males are never told where they're going or what kind of evening it's going be when they're with women. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Cynthia and Felicia had gossiped enough about collars, they gathered in the living room. Felicia asked if Cynthia wanted something to drink.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just a Maso-Cola, if you don't mind," answered Cynthia.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem. Nathasha, would you show Jeff where the colas are in the fridge?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course!" she said as Cynthia gave her the leash. Jeff was more than thrilled to finally being led on a leash by Nathasha. She couldn't help notice the look in his eyes. If Cynthia would have seen this, she would have made a scene.

&nbsp; Like a good dog, Jeff followed Nathasha in the kitchen. As she was opening the fridge's door to show him where the cans where, she couldn't help noticing the bulge in Jeff pants. The boy was red with shame.&nbsp; He begged for her forgiveness.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please Nathasha, I'm begging you - don't tell Cynthia. She's gonna kill me!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nathasha was rather flattered by Jeff's interest. She looked above his shoulder to see Felicia showing the cover of the DVD to Cynthia who was thrilled to see a new available chapter of Justicia: The Modern Amazon.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's okay. I don't think she saw you," she whispered to him and pointed to the colas in the fridge. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take those for us."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Nathasha."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did Cynthia permit you to have one?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeff wasn't sure.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think so. Maybe I should ask her."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's okay. If you need to drink, just ask to go to the bathroom. You can drink water from the shower."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeff nodded. Once he had the cans in his hands, Nathasha led him back to the living room.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cynthia couldn't help noticing how at-ease Nathasha was at leading Jeff behind her. She was such a natural dominant at heart. She just gave a tug on Jeff's leash and he knew exactly where she wanted him to sit on the floor, not too far from Cynthia but far enough from her so she wouldn't inadvertently rest her feet on him like she's used to do with her brothers or father. Cynthia might see this as an insult. After all, Jeff was her&#8217;s now.
&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Where's your brother?" Cynthia asked Nathasha.
&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The asshole is cleaning my room. Don't mind him." she said with a neutral tone. Jeff was silent. He didn't even know what movie they were going to watch.
 
&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A moment later, they heard another knocked at the door. This time, Daniel, who was going up the stairs, was the first to get to the door. A stranger was there.
It was Greg, Felicia's new sex toy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daniel was a bit uneasy to open the door to the man who was gonna spend the night with his wife. As a husband, he had no say in her sexual activity. If she wanted to have sex with another male, that was her right.
 
&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The presentation went as fast as with Jeff who remained sitting in the living room. When Greg was presented to Nathasha, he was dazzled by her beauty.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; Felicia saw it.&nbsp; She was tempted to slap Greg for such insolence but she tried to remain calm. Somehow, Cynthia noticed the look he gave her too.&nbsp; Nathasha, used to see this reaction from most males, felt embarrassed when she saw in her mother's face that she was trying to hide her anger.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nathasha felt Greg's handshake last a bit longer than it should have normally been. He couldn't help but try to keep as much as possible her soft and graceful hand in his.
&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as Nathasha was free, she turned back to the living room. To make the matter worse, Jeff was watching her every steps as if she was the eight wonder of the world. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nathasha thought, "Sometimes, you just can't win."
&nbsp; All were assembled in the living room. Both males were never introduced. They took place on the floor as the women sat behind them in the couch.&nbsp; Nathasha started the movie. It was about time.
 During the movie, Peter showed up after cleaning Nathasha's room. Nathasha discreetly signalled her brother to follow him downstairs where Daniel was in the basement, tending the plants.
 Daniel saw Nathasha walking down the stairs followed by Peter.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The movie is already finished?" he asked, curious.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No. I just want to talk to Peter in private."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh!" said Daniel. Nathasha looked at him in silence. He didn't need words to know he had to get upstairs and wait for her to come back.&nbsp; He took off his gardening gloves and climbed the stairs in silence. Nathasha turned to her brother, hands on hips.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get down on your knees and apologize to me!" she said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter knelt before his sister with his head down. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What was that earlier, Peter?" she asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know...I'm...I'm sorry, Nathasha.&nbsp; I didn't mean to get angry at you."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why were you angry?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well..." he said while looking at his sister, but Nathasha looked so dominant that he lowered his eyes again, looking at her feet instead. Half an hour ago, he was shining the same boots he had in front of him. He felt humiliated. His tone was shy. He was almost whispering.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's just that...you know, the way men are treated...I find it hard to see how the world is like."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nathasha was equally calm. She looked down at her brother. Something she was used to since they were kids.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you mean, Peter? There's no war, no hunger. It's just the beginning of the 21st century and it's never been better in the world. What's wrong with it?" she asked him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's just that...well...it's a woman's world.&nbsp; It's like for men, there's no respect."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So it's about that silly idea about equality between men and women, right?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter nodded his head.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Peter?" she asked while raising his chin. She could see the shame in his brother's eyes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who's on his knees right now, Peter? You or I?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's me, Nathasha." he said, red as a lobster.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aren't you happy like that?&nbsp; You know how men are naturally submissive. You all want to be told what to do by women. It's been proven dozen of times." 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter remained silent. He was too embarrassed to look his sister in the eyes. She still had his chin between her fingers. She wouldn't let go until he admitted what he already knew. Men weren't meant to be treated as equals. They were inferior to women, and only women could decide the males' place in society.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; In her entire life, Nathasha had never seen a man in a position of power. She knew that throughout her life and forever in the future, the world would be dominated by women.&nbsp; Throughout the last decades, males accepted to live under female leadership and now that women were in control - that could never change.
&nbsp; Peter was almost about to cry. In this world, it was the males who were crying the most.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You wanna say you're sorry?" asked Nathasha to her brother on his knees before her.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Nathasha. I'm so sorry!" 
&nbsp; Nathasha smiled. Despite his distress, she was still holding him by the chin and she had no intention to let go. She enjoyed her brother's humiliation.&nbsp; But she wanted more from him than a simple apology on his knees.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now kiss my boots!" she said.
Peter looked at her with tears in his eyes. He couldn't believe she would ask him to do that.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on, Peter. You know how clean they are. You were polishing them less than an hour ago."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nathasha could hear her brother swallow as she was holding his chin as high as he could lift it.&nbsp; When she saw in his eyes that he was hesitating, she asked even more of him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thinking about it, why don't you lick them instead, hmm?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he heard her saying this, his eyes grew wide open. Now he wasn't just humiliated, he was scared. She finally let go of his chin.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's right, little brother. Lick my boots clean."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lowered his head and began licking his sister's boots, much to her delight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was carefully polishing her boots with his tongue this time. He wanted to make sure the entire surface of the black leather boots would be shining so she could see herself in it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the first boot was licked, he moved on to the next. To see if he had done a good job, she placed her boot on the back of his head to get a better view.&nbsp; 
"Not bad," she said with a smile on her face.&nbsp; Then she added: "Keep up the good work...asshole!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This time, his brother accepted her humiliating remark as he continued to lick her other boot.

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once he was done to her satisfaction, he placed the other boot on his lap to see if he had licked that one as well as the other. Then she stood in front of him. She raised his chin again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter was completely powerless in front of her. In less than a few minutes, she had reduced her rebellious brother as a mere pet at her feet.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, was it so bad to clean my boots with your tongue?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Mistress," he said. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was surprised to hear him calling her "Mistress". Obviously, she thought, she should have done that a long, long time ago.&nbsp; Since she could walk, she was already using her brothers as her slaves but this kind of submission was downright thrilling.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had him apologize again and kiss her boots. Then she ordered him to stand up. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's okay, then. I'll let you off the hook. The next time, I won't be so forgiving," she warned him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, Mistress," he said meekly.&nbsp; Since then, she knew he would never dare to simply call her Nathasha.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they got at the top of the stairs, Peter asked: "Should I call you that way from now on?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She whispered to his ear: "Only in private."

&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Peter was too exhausted to watch the movie so he kindly asked his mother permission to remain in his room. Felicia asked Nathasha if she needed her brother for something and when she answered "No", she dismissed her son, much to his relief.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Daniel was about to go down the stairs again to attend the plants when she saw the gleaming look on her daughter's boots.&nbsp; He looked at her, surprised.&nbsp; She knew how to shut him down.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You wanna lick them too, Dad?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daniel lowered his head and said "No."
&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Okay," answered Nathasha. "Go down to the basement and continue your work. This is Mother's evening with her toy, remember?"
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daniel nodded and went down the stairs. After tending the plants, he fell asleep in the old couch and didn't show up until morning.

&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathasha rejoined the others in the living room to watch the predictable ending of "Justicia: The Modern Amazon Part 7" as she killed all the bad guys and gave a hell of a beating to the leader of the group. The poor sap couldn't stand much of Justicia's fighting skills. He ended up at her feet in a pool of his own blood. 

&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathasha watched the final scene and smiled. A moment ago, her own brother was at her feet too, and she didn't need to beat him up. Of course, the idea of using her fighting skills against her brother did cross her mind. He was much bigger and older than she was but there was no way he could have defeated her.&nbsp; Males were stronger but women were too smart, too fast and too agile for men defeat them. But she didn't want all that blood on her boots, or else she would have ordered her brother to lick them for her. What a mess it would have made on her boots!
&nbsp;&nbsp; After the movie, Nathasha and Cynthia went for a walk. Jeff followed them on a leash. Unfortunately for him, Cynthia never allowed Nathasha to hold him again, but Jeff kept looking at Nathasha walking in front of him in her black leather jacket.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; The two girls were talking about all kinds of stuff and were completely ignoring him. During the entire evening, Jeff felt like he wasn't really there. He was just following two powerful females in an all female-dominated society and he was just taking the place they wanted him to take.&nbsp; He was more like a dog on a leash. A pet to have around.&nbsp; He was a man lead by two women and he was lucky he was allowed to walk behind them on his two feet instead of crawling like a puppy on his all-fours.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Felicia took Greg in her bedroom. She undressed him and had sex with him.&nbsp; Once she had several orgasms, he asked if he could stay for the night since he had no place to go.&nbsp; She laughed at him and ordered him to leave.&nbsp; He put his clothes on and left, feeling used and humiliated.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter slept like a rock. He heard nothing of her mother's screams of pleasure during her orgasms.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daniel couldn't sleep at all that night.&nbsp; He heard his wife having these orgasms and was afraid that she might dump him for that cocky playgirl model. He felt relieved when he heard him leaving the house early in the morning.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He heard Nathasha and Cynthia saying good bye at the front door.&nbsp; While Cynthia was checking for bus tickets in her purse, Nathasha grabbed Jeff's collar and kissed him on the lips.&nbsp; Jeff was stunned, but he knew now what Nathasha thought of him. His hopes weren't in vain. Cynthia noticed nothing as it happened very fast. As soon as she got the tickets, she pulled on Jeff's collar and waved at Nathasha.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daniel climbed the stairs to see if everything was alright and to make sure Greg wasn't coming back. Nathasha was upstairs. Before he could ask anything, she said:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dad?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Nathasha?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go back to sleep!"&nbsp; 






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part 5 - The Prom Night and the Promise of a Greater Future 


&nbsp;&nbsp; Nathasha was in her room, picking up the dress she was looking for to wear for Prom Night.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexy Wear Slut Street had those very interesting &#8211; not to mention sexy &#8211; baby doll dresses.&nbsp; Only one of them in the entire store was in black leather and, of course, that's the one Nathasha picked up. It was short and tight, just like she wanted. Black leather thigh-high high heels boots would fit perfectly well, she thought. And she was right. With those boots on, she felt in her element. She was sexy and very powerful. Elbow length leather gloves added the final touch.&nbsp; Her hair looked perfect. A bit of make up here, her pair of earings representing the sign of Female Supremacy there, and that was it. 
&nbsp; Once again, she looked like the goddess she was meant to be.

&nbsp; She had picked up Steve Sanchez for her date at the prom.&nbsp; Steve made all the guys jealous when he proudly announced he was going to the prom with Nathasha. Steve was a stud looking guy, at least since The Northern Amazons, the high school football team, had recruited him into their cheerleader squad. Under the whip of Ms. Twain, the guys learned to develop grace and agility. After three months of hard training, Steve turned out to be quite a catch. His now perfectly toned musculature was only matched by his obedience, docility and desire to please. 
&nbsp; 
&nbsp; For many, this was the idea of the perfect male creature: Healthy, good-looking and one who knows his place.&nbsp; Nathasha was the kind of girl who would enhance his qualities even more and he knew it.&nbsp; She was in complete control of her man and he knew he had no say.

&nbsp; Cynthia was looking forward to the prom as well. She was wearing a red vinyl dress with matching high heel shoes. She was wearing short red gloves and her hair were falling down her shoulders. She lit up a cigarette and looked at herself in the mirror. A real knock-out!

&nbsp; Jeff, on the other hand, was feeling uncomfortable in his tuxedo.&nbsp; For once, at least, he would not have to wear Cynthia's collar again.&nbsp; Since Cynthia decided to make him hers, he had to wear it no matter what and at all times. He even had to sleep with it.&nbsp; Even when they were making love, he still had it on. And Cynthia just loved to caress his collared neck during sex.&nbsp; For her, it was the ultimate symbol that, no matter what he was doing or where he was, she still had her hand on his throat. He was her property and she didn't want him to forget that. Not even for an instant.
&nbsp; Since the prom had arrived and males were obligated to wear a tuxedo, she removed the collar from him.&nbsp; However, Jeff knew that she would not let him roam free at the ball. He wasn't collared anymore, but she was still holding a tight leash on him anyway.

&nbsp; The limousine arrived at Cynthia's first.&nbsp; 
"I'll meet you in 15 minutes at the ball, Jeff. Don't be late."
"Yes, Cynthia." he said while opening the door for her. Knowing she expected him to be at the prom in 15 minutes, he figured she had probably calculated the exact time it would take him 

to get there by foot.&nbsp; He did not dare to challenge her and started to walk as soon as the limo left.
&nbsp; 
&nbsp; A few minutes later,&nbsp; Felicia was giving a kiss to her daughter and told her how proud she was of her. Daniel was at her side, very proud of her as well.&nbsp; Peter had never had this kind of encouragement from his parents.&nbsp; After high school was finished, there [was] (were) no more avenues for males except menial work. Either they would marry and stay home or they would be models. Babysitter was a male job but the pay was low, as it is for all male income. The best way to have a future for a man was to please and therefore seduce a beautiful and powerful woman.

&nbsp; If Steve thought that he had any chance of a long lasting relationship with Nathasha, he was dead wrong.&nbsp; She was just using him for the prom and after that she was planning to dump him.&nbsp; No harm done.&nbsp; She knew he'd find someone to use him more permanently anyway. 

&nbsp; "Hi Nathasha! Oh my goddess! You look fantastic!" Cynthia said when she saw Nathasha's dress, long gloves and boots.
&nbsp; "You look pretty hot yourself, Cyn!" she said with a smile.&nbsp; They both knew they were gonna have fun tonight.

&nbsp; The girls had fun enjoying the comfort of the limo. On their way, there were other similar cars like this as well. It was easy to know which boys where heading for the ball too. They were all in tuxedos, walking down the street with their hands in their pockets.
&nbsp; "It's so unfair to them! We're here in limousines while they have to walk! Poor dears!" Cynthia said sarcastically.
&nbsp; "Let's bring one here!" suggested Nathasha
&nbsp; "What do you mean? I was just kidding, y'know. I don't want a male in this car!" protested Cynthia.
&nbsp; "Of course you do! It's just that you don't know how we can use a male once he's in."
Cynthia was wondering what Nathasha meant. 
&nbsp; "You want to bring one of those guys here and force him to practice cunnilingus on you?"
Nathasha busted out in laughter.
&nbsp; "With my fabulous dress on? Are you kidding? That's Steve job, after the party. Then I'll dump him. No. I just want us to be more comfortable."
&nbsp; "Frankly, Nath, I don't know what you mean..."&nbsp; Nathasha interrupted her and asked the driver to stop the car alongside the street.
&nbsp; "Take a good look and learn," Nathasha said in a whisper as she put her finger on her mouth.&nbsp; She lowered her window.
&nbsp; "Here." she said, whispering again. "Take a look at those guys coming down the street in their tuxs."
&nbsp; "Yes, I see them. They're everywhere. What of it?" asked Cynthia.
&nbsp; "I'll show you. You see, all of the good-looking ones already have a date. That means they're off limits. However, what about all those other guys who will be there with no one to be with? Those are the ones you can use for a little fun. They belong to no one."
 

 Cynthia laughed.
&nbsp; "So what are you gonna do? Tie one up in the trunk of the limousine so we can play with him after the ball?"
&nbsp; Nathasha was surprised to hear Cynthia say that.&nbsp; She smiled.
"Looks like you're making progress, Cyn! That's actually a good idea."
The both laughed. The driver, a male, was suddenly feeling uncomfortable but he remained silent.
&nbsp; A few guys passed by but they didn't fit Nathasha's description of "ugly". She kept looking until she found what she was looking for. On the other side of the street, there was a bunch of ugly ones. She wanted a closer look at them.
&nbsp; "Driver! Take the car at the next corner and block their way! I wanna talk to them!" she ordered the guy in front.&nbsp; The driver took the limo to the other side of the street and blocked the way of the ugly boys on their way to the prom.&nbsp; Nathasha took Cynthia's place and lowered the window.
&nbsp; "Hey, guys!" she said.
&nbsp; "huh...hello." one of the four said.
&nbsp; "I see you're going to the prom. Do all of you have a date?" 
&nbsp; The guys couldn't believe what she just said. They were actually thinking she didn't have anyone to go with and that she was asking one of them. How far they were from the truth. Cynthia noticed their surprised and couldn't help but laugh at them.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; "What a bunch of losers!" she said out loud. 
They heard her but didn't say anything.
&nbsp; "That's the point, Cyn!" responded Nathasha, and they heard her too.
&nbsp; "So?" she continued talking to them. "Any of you have a date?"
&nbsp; The guy who spoke before answered her.
&nbsp; "Only one of us." he said while showing him to Nathasha. 
&nbsp; "So the others are free?" she asked them.
&nbsp; They nodded.
&nbsp; "You haven't told me what you wanna do, Nath." Cynthia said.
&nbsp; "This one's taken. This one's got too much acne. The other one is a bit too fat," she said.
Only one guy remained.
&nbsp; "You!" she said, pointing at him.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; "Me?" he asked, wondering what those girls could possibly want with him. The others were surprised as well.
&nbsp; "Yes, you, the moron! Get in the car!" she said while opening the door.
&nbsp; The guy looked at his friends but they were all unable to understand why she wanted him to come along. He was hesitant to do what she was saying.
&nbsp; "Hey!" said Nathasha, snapping her fingers. 
&nbsp; "I said: Get in!" 
The guy obeyed her. She closed the door without saying another word to the other guys and ordered the driver to take them to the prom.
&nbsp; 
&nbsp; The guy was sitting between Nathasha and Cynthia in the back seat of the limo. 
"What's your name?" Nathasha asked him.
"George," he responded.
"What did he say?" asked Cynthia who didn't hear him well.
"It's not important," retorted Nathasha before he could repeat his name.
"George, you will not sit between us like this." said Nathasha.
George turned to her.
"What do you mean?"
"I want you to lay down on the floor so we can rest our feet on you."
"Whaat?" he said, surprised.
"Right here, boy!" she said, pointing to the floor.
The driver was looking at the scene in his mirror. He couldn't believe what she just said.
George was a bit slow and still hesitant but he obeyed.&nbsp; As soon as he was in position, it didn't take long for Nathasha to rest her feet right down on his face.
Cynthia was a bit hesitant as well, but she finally rested a foot on his chest and the other one on his belly.
"So that's what it's about!" she said.
"Cyn, this is prom night! It's time for us to relax and enjoy what life has to offer."
Cynthia laughed.
"Are you sure he's okay with it? I mean, you treat him like a rug. Is he comfortable at least?"
Nathasha looked down at him.
"Yeah. He seems fine."
"What's his name again?"&nbsp; asked Cynthia. George wanted to answer but Nathasha pressed down her boot on his mouth.&nbsp; 
"I told you: It's not important."
Cynthia burst out in laughter again. 
"I can't believe it!" she said, wiping off a tear in her eye.&nbsp; Nathasha wanted to tease him further.
"You're not important, are you, boy? Don't you wanna do something useful, huh, boy?" Nathasha said to him as if she was talking to a puppy.
The guy couldn't answer as she pushed one of her high heels deep down in his mouth.
"Suck on this, boy! That's it, stupid! Be a good doggie!" she said. George was so intimidated by her authority, as well as her beauty, that he obeyed her. The girls were rolling on the floor when the poor sap began to suck Nathasha's heel. 
"What a moron!" Cynthia said and they both laughed again.

&nbsp; The limo arrived at the ball room. Cynthia came out first, followed by Nathasha. Everyone turned to look at them, especially at Nathasha. 
George waited for Nathasha's permission to get out of the limo.
"It's okay, Georgie-boy. You can come out now!" 
One of the girl at the party saw this very ordinary looking guy coming out of her limo and asked Nathasha if he really was her date.
Nathasha laughed.
"Are you kidding? We just picked him off the street for fun."
"He's the footstool." said Cynthia to the girl who thought it was a joke. When she saw how red he was in the face, she started to believe it.
"You can go now, my little footstool," Nathasha said to George without even looking at him. She was looking for Steve.
"Where's that idiot anyway?" she wondered as George was dusting his tuxedo and moving away from them.


"Let's see inside!" suggested Cynthia.&nbsp; On this, they both headed for the ball.

&nbsp; Once in the ballroom, Steve saw Nathasha and couldn't believe how beautiful and attractive she was. He rushed over to her.
"Nathasha! I'm so glad you've arrived! Oh my! You're beautiful. I've never seen anyone so hot!"
"How nice to hear that." said Nathasha. "Now get me some punch, will ya?"
"Right away!" Steve said while looking at Nathasha's leather dress. His eyes were focusing on her breasts. She had seen that look before. She was flattered but Steve was just standing&nbsp; there, dazzled by her beauty. She had to slap him back and forth for him to get out of his trance.
"My punch, you dipshit!" she said.
"Oh yes! I'm sorry, Nathasha! It's just...well...you're so hot!"
"You'll have the chance to admire my body all evening long, Steve. But first, you must learn how to behave. Do what I say."
The other guys at the prom were looking at Nathasha and were all under her spell. Of course they were dozens of other girls in leather, latex and sexy dresses but none of them could compete with her.&nbsp; She had this aura of self-confidence, this assurance that was making men weak in their knees. Watching her walking, so at ease in those boots, wasn't helping either.&nbsp; How many of them dreamed of what George had to endure this evening? How many of them would have done practically anything to be at her feet just for one night?&nbsp; 
&nbsp; Steve was the chosen one for spending the night with her and despite the slaps he got for not being quick enough, he felt he was in Heaven.

&nbsp; Cynthia and Jeff, who made it in time, joined Nathasha and Steve at their table. The music was playing loud and everyone was having fun.&nbsp; The punch already had a taste of vodka and the crowd was festive. Nathasha saw George with his friends in one of the corner of the 
ballroom. He was telling them about what she and Cynthia had done to him in the limo earlier. He seemed frustrated by the way he had been treated, but she didn't care. She knew he would never do anything to her, not even complaining directly to her.&nbsp; After a moment, one of his friends came to her.
"If you want another footstool on your way home, I'll be more than happy to be used by you, Nathasha." 
Steve and Jeff didn't understand what the guy was saying, but the girls did. They both laughed.
"I'll think about it." she said to him before dismissing him.
"Were you serious?" asked Cynthia.
"Are you kidding? All this acne on his face is no good for my boots!"
"Not even the soles?" Cynthia asked with a grin.&nbsp; 
"No way!" said Nathasha while finishing her drink.
"Besides..." she added while raising Steve's chin, "This one's better!"

&nbsp; The girls had a lot of fun that night.&nbsp; Everyone talked about what they were gonna do after high school. Most of them were going to college. Well, the females anyway. 

&nbsp; For the boys, there was no more school or higher education in sight. For the females, it was just the beginning. 
&nbsp; One of them said she wanted to go to the university after college to become a politician, another one wanted to be an astronaut. Several others wanted to become physicians or lawyers.&nbsp; Cynthia was thinking about a career in the Navy. Nathasha had only one thing in mind: to join the Disciplinarian Corp. 
 
 As the party was coming to an end, Nathasha headed for the ladies room to check on her hair before leaving with Steve.&nbsp; Jeff took this opportunity to talk to her as she was coming out.
"May I talk to you in private, please?"
Unseen by the crowd, Nathasha took him in a corridor. She didn't want anyone to see her with her friend's boyfriend so she managed to open the locked door of one of the empty rooms on the second floor. Jeff was amazed about how fast she was at opening it and how easy it seemed to her.
"Come in." she said, pulling him by his wrist.
"So? What do you want to say to me?" she asked.
"Nathasha! I'm...I'm in love with you!"
Nathasha hesitated a second before responding.&nbsp; She knew this moment would come.
"Jeff, I know."
"You do? Oh! Please..." Jeff said, "tell me you feel the same way about me!"
"Well..." Nathasha began. "I do have a certain attraction for you, Jeff. I don't know if it's love, but I do like you...a lot. I think I'm growing fond of you."
Jeff smiled broadly. This was a lot more than what he was hoping for.&nbsp; He fell to his knees before her and started kissing her boots.&nbsp; Nathasha didn't move an inch. She was looking at Jeff grovelling on the floor for her. For a moment, she felt a bit excited, even aroused by his submissiveness, but only for an instant. She couldn't help but remember this was her best friend's boyfriend who was kissing her feet at this very moment. 
"Oh! Nathasha! I love you so much! Please, make me your slave! I'll do anything you want, please!" he was begging her while continuously kissing her boots from top to toe.
"Jeff...you're with Cynthia! She's my best friend! I can't do that to her! You know that!" she said in a sad tone. Jeff looked at her.
"I never wanted to be her property. It's you I want!" he said. 
"Isn't she treating you well?" Nathasha asked.
"Yes, but...I would like you to treat me the way she does. I'm just not in love with her."
Nathasha crossed her arms.
"You know, it wouldn't be the first time a man had to marry a woman he's not in love with. Think about your future, Jeff."
Jeff lowered his head and nodded, but he took a deep breath and looked directly at Nathasha.
"I'd rather live the rest of my life under a bridge than not be with you!"
Nathasha couldn't help thinking about the evening when she and her friends, including Cynthia, and what they all did with those homeless males a few months back. That's when she got her first extra credit to join the Guard.&nbsp; She was trying to picture Jeff in torned clothes, running away from girls like her.&nbsp; Jan or Emily would show him no mercy. 
&nbsp; 
&nbsp; If Jeff would try to run away from Cynthia and she would caught him in the same circumstances, she would give him the beating of his life. A man cheating on his girlfriend is not safe in this society. He could even do prison time.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; Jeff was now crawling before Nathasha. She had to pull him by the hair to get him to stand up on his knees.
&nbsp; "Listen to me, Jeff. As long as you're with Cynthia, there will be nothing between us."
&nbsp; "What about you and Steve? Will you marry him?"&nbsp; Nathasha smiled.
&nbsp; "After this evening, I don't think you'll see Mister Muscle for very long. I'll have sex with him this evening and then I'll dump him."

&nbsp; Jeff looked at Nathasha with fear in his eyes. She had just admitted to be willing to have sex with such a stud like Steve and then simply dump him like an old shoe. Jeff wondered what he could have for himself so that Nathasha could be fond of him. 
&nbsp; Nathasha was heading toward the door to return to the ball.&nbsp; Jeff was on all-fours, begging her to stay.
&nbsp; "Jeff! You can't follow me like a dog like this all night long!"
&nbsp; "I would spend my life like this if you would have me! You could cut my legs to the knees so I'd never stand up again and I'd gladly take it!" he said out loud.
&nbsp; Nathasha smiled. It was the first time she heard a man saying he'd be willing to be amputated for her pleasure. She was flattered.
&nbsp; The lights were dimming. She knew the crowd was almost gone from the ballroom and she had to go.
&nbsp; "Come on, Jeff! Stand up now and try to be discreet. We never had this conversation, got it?"
&nbsp; "Please, Nathasha..."
&nbsp; "I gave you an order, Jeff!" she said on a stern tone.&nbsp; Jeff nodded his head and stood up. He followed her to the ballroom, keeping his eyes down only to raise them once in a while to see her magnificent butt.&nbsp; The sound of her boots on the floor was driving him nuts. He couldn't help being turned on by her power.&nbsp; Suddenly, when they arrived on the first floor, she turned around and pushed him hard. He wasn't expecting it and ended up falling behind a line of chairs.&nbsp; He turned to her, wondering why she did so.
&nbsp; "Shut up!" she said.&nbsp; Then he saw Cynthia arriving in their direction. 
&nbsp; "What's happening? Did you see Jeff?" she asked.
&nbsp; "Nope. I guess he must be sitting somewhere."
&nbsp; "I didn't see him anywhere. Where could that animal be hiding?"
&nbsp; "Let's see if he's outside," Nathasha said, grabbing Cynthia by the shoulders and taking her to the door.
&nbsp; "I doubt he would have the audacity to leave me without my permission." said Cynthia.
&nbsp; "And if he did, you can whip him!" Said Nathasha with a smile, looking back at Jeff who understood he had better move quickly via the corridor and show up at the door before they did.


&nbsp; "Ah? Really? I can do that?" said Cynthia, as if she had never thought of whipping her boyfriend before.

&nbsp; Once at the motel, Nathasha ordered Steve to get naked. She even stepped on his tuxedo that he'd left on the floor with her boots. She kept her dress on while he was naked on the bed waiting for her on his knees. She joined him on the bed and stood up on her knees in front of him. She jumped on him and they started kissing each other. Steve was finally able to touch her. He was caressing her through her leather as she was grabbing his ass like a piece of meat. After several minutes of necking, she pushed him down and stoop on top of him as if he was her conquest. She was in total control. She was still wearing her long leather gloves&nbsp; as she ordered him to open his mouth wide. As soon as he did, she pushed two fingers down his throat and ordered him to suck on them.&nbsp; His boner was hard as stone. With her other hand, she took off her dress and impaled herself on him.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; As she was riding him like a wild beast, she put four fingers down his throat as if she wanted to control his breathing. At the same time, with her other hand, she was taking pleasure in pinching his nipples. They became red hot in no time. Under Nathasha's domination, he started to understand the meaning of the expression "Pleasure and pain". He knew now how she could be the master of his body.&nbsp; She was taking things a step further this evening by taking dominion over his soul as well. He was physically much stronger than she was but she was the one in control. She suddenly pushed his head down on the pillow with her hand so hard that he felt that his jaw was about to break. That's when she began to orgasm.&nbsp; In her eyes was the look of the black panther falling down on her prey. She had now her other hand at his throat. He was trying to breath as much as possible and for a moment he couldn't catch his breath anymore. For half a second he thought she wanted to kill him. That's when he pushed her back a bit. Of course, she didn't take kindly to being treated with such disrespect. She gave him a hard knee in the nuts and put her hand back into his mouth. 
"Relax." she whispered to him. 
She impaled herself again on his dick but this time he wasn't so hard anymore. The kick in the groin had seen to that.&nbsp; She started to play with his nipples again and his dick became as hard as a rock once more. Steve felt he was being manipulated. Clearly she was enjoying herself without a care in the world about how he was feeling. Then she got a second orgasm. Then&nbsp; a third. As she was sinking her claws even more into him, she was about to get the fourth but he couldn't move, completely drained by her power. She slapped him back and forth, with no result. When she saw he was unable to give her more, she decided to let him go.
&nbsp; She lay down at his side. For once, he was able to catch his breath without her gloved hand down his throat. She saw teeth marks on her glove.
 "You'll get me a new pair." 
 "Whatever you say." he said. Despite his impressive physique, he realized he was no match for this lusty feline. The prey that he was was down for the count.

&nbsp; Early in the morning, she still seemed soundly fucked. She noticed she had never removed her boots of the evening but since she had to go, she kept them on. She went to the bathroom to arrange her hair again and put on her evening dress.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; Steve was awake but still in bed. 
&nbsp; "Are you going to leave me now?" he asked.
&nbsp; "What makes you say that?" 
&nbsp; "Cynthia told me that at the prom. She said you wanted to dump me right after we had sex."
&nbsp; Nathasha looked at Steve. How could he knew this unless Cynthia had told him so?&nbsp; She couldn't believe Cynthia would do that to her, especially when she could have taken Jeff from her last night. The poor boy was crawling on his knees for her and she turned him down because of her "best friend".
 
She didn't like this at all.

&nbsp; "To be perfectly honest with you, Steve, it's true. I no longer need you. The Prom's over, you know."
&nbsp; "So I was just...what? A plaything to you? Is that it?" She looked at him and bounced her shoulders.
&nbsp; "Sort of."
&nbsp; Steve looked at her.
&nbsp; "You know what you are, Nathasha?"
&nbsp; She was now looking at him. The idea of kicking his balls again crossed her mind. If he had anything negative to say about her or to complain in any way, he would lose them for good.
&nbsp; Steve saw that look in her eyes and instinctively put his hand in front of his crotch. His tone changed to a more respectful one.
&nbsp; "Respectfully, I'd say you're like a black widow."
&nbsp; Nathasha was surprised to hear him say that but she had to agree with him. For her, it was a compliment. Steve saw she took it that way. 
&nbsp; "Is that what we men are to you women?" he asked.
&nbsp; "What do you mean?" she said with a smile.
&nbsp; "Are we just like cattle to you? Like sex objects to be controlled or humiliated?"
&nbsp; "Steve, don't make such a big deal of it! You guys have it easy. In Japan, many women have their men castrated after the divorce." He put both hands at his crotch.
She smiled to him again.&nbsp; 
"Men are women's playthings. You know that and I know it too!&nbsp; Bye now!"
&nbsp; Steve lowered his eyes. He couldn't believe what she just said...and she meant it.

&nbsp; "Oh, Steve?" she asked right before closing the door.
&nbsp; "Yes, Nathasha?"
&nbsp; "If I want you to be my sex object again, I'll let you know, okay? See ya!"

&nbsp; "The arrogance of that girl!" he thought as she closed the door behind her.

&nbsp; He stayed in bed for a few hours, wondering what he would do next. Aside from the fact that she had gave him a knee in his private parts last night, he was convinced his balls would have been swollen anyway from all the action he had with her a few hours ago. He couldn't stop thinking about her, over and over and over.

&nbsp; Despite the way she treated him today, and the opinion she had of him as a sex toy, he was under the impression that if she would call him, he'd respond to her call and do whatever she wants again.




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE END
