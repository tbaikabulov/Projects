��������������� Iniquity:
Prologue

&nbsp;

The courtroom was packed, the
anticipation heavy in the air. The judge was trying his best to appear calm,
even though he was as excited as everyone in the courtroom was. After 5 months
of waiting, the big verdict was about to come in, and he, the Honorable Judge
Laurence, was about to preside over a historic event. The judge motioned to one
of the deputies, and the room was suddenly quiet. Slowly, the 12 jurors filed
into the room and the proceedings began.

��������������� 

��������������� Kate
was in the crowd of onlookers that was assembled outside the courthouse to hear
the verdict. The atmosphere outside the courtroom was electric, and wild
theories about how the verdict would go were flying in all directions. She
noticed a man in a conservative black suit standing near the fire hydrant,
impatient and cursing under his breath. His name was Mr. Gavin, and few people
knew what he really did. All Kate knew was that he was �in charge of the
defense�, in his own words.

&nbsp;

She quickly walked towards him, �Did you follow the
instructions to the letter?� she asked in a whisper.

&nbsp;

�You know I did, dammit, now tell
me you did your part too� he said and turned around and looked her in the eye.
�We�ve been working on this for 2 months, everything
is exactly the way it should be.�

&nbsp;

Without answering, Kate evenly returned his gaze. She wasn�t
sure if he was lying, but he looked so nervous and angry she decided he was
most likely telling the truth. Reaching into her pocket, she took out a small
cell phone and dialed a number. As soon as she heard the ring tone, she hung
up. �Done. You have your verdict. Now that wasn�t so
hard, was it?�

&nbsp;

As soon as he heard those words, he visibly sagged with
relief. He had worked with this bitch for 2 months, as soon as he realized her
importance. Working for the huge corporation that was the subject of the
jillion-dollar lawsuit, he wasted no time, or money, making sure nothing went
wrong. Her appearance had initially upset him, but he then saw the opportunity
she presented. All he had to do was play along, and she would give him any
verdict he wanted, for a price. How? He had hired every detective in the
country to watch her and her game was simple. She had a friend in the jury, one
that was very capable of manipulating the other members of the jury. All her
little friend had to do was convince everyone to believe in what she did. Those
that didn�t, she had thrown out of the jury for talking about the case, and
replaced by an alternate that was more willing to do what she said. It was a
brilliant plan, one that even impressed him. She now had $20 million in a Swiss
Bank; pennies compared to what this verdict could have awarded. 

&nbsp;

Back inside the courtroom, Judge Laurence was swelling with
confidence. He had been working very hard to make sure that his case would go
smoothly, and he knew that everyone across the country would be reading the
magic headline �Judge Laurence, presiding over the most important case of the
century�� He smiled as his thoughts trailed and he lost himself in his fantasy.
Then, with great pomp the foreman announced that the defendant was found �Not
Guilty�, and the plaintiff awarded exactly $0. As Judge Laurence would remember
this day for years to come, Justice had been carried out. 

&nbsp;

Outside the courtroom, the reaction was mixed, but
nevertheless everyone reacted pretty much as expected. Local officials were
already telling everybody how they had predicted the result years ago, and
people were already lining up to take credit for the victory against the
plaintiff. 

&nbsp;

As Kate heard the news, she looked across to the man in the
suit and smiled behind her sunglasses. This had been something she had been
planning for years, and, together with Jessica, they had made themselves $20
million. She could hardly contain her excitement as she shook hands with him,
and then tried her best not to run away as she walked away from the courtroom. $20 million. It was hard for her to believe that she had
finally done it, finally followed through with the plan of a lifetime. She was
so happy that Jessica had handled the jury fine, that
she had played the creepy man like a fool, and she was so happy she didn�t
notice as two men spotted her and followed at a distance.

&nbsp;

As soon as Kate left, the man by the fire hydrant lost the
pathetic look he had faked for Kate�s benefit. He walked inside the building
opposite the courthouse, went through the hidden door on the other side, and
into the unmarked surveillance van waiting on the other side. He wanted to do
this himself, not save it for any of the myriads of willing
lackeys he had at his disposal. Working for such a big corporation allowed him
practically unlimited funds, and as long as the bosses got away with a Not
Guilty verdict, he could do whatever he liked. 

&nbsp;

He had been debating all those 2 months what he could do
with Kate, and even if she could be trusted to convince the jury. He had had
the best, trained professionals examine every facial expression, every eye
movement, every slight twitch in her face when he
recorded their �private� meetings. The conclusion was unanimous; she was not
lying about her influence on the jury. He had exhausted every possible lead,
and every intimate detail about her, her partner, and every member of the jury.
Sure, he reasoned, he could get the jury to do what he
wanted with the usual mix of threats and bribery, but this was easier. Besides,
he reasoned, if he snubbed her she might make the jury vote against him, out of
spite. No, he reasoned, better to play along and wait until it was safely over.


&nbsp;

He had a thick file on Kate and Jessica. Everything from
where they were born, to where they went to school, to their various
boyfriends, favorite movies, brand of toothpaste; he had it all. It had been
obvious from the start that once the trial was over,
she had to be taken out. How didn�t matter, but the risk that she might tell
someone about her little adventure was not something his bosses were going to
accept. He thought about killing her, but had decided that would be too easy.
Besides, he had always dreamed of owning a pet, and now he had one within his
grasp�

&nbsp;

�Lets go to the next location, a
little before she supposed to meet Jessica. I have a little surprise planned��



&nbsp;



&nbsp;

Jessica walked down the path she had rehearsed a thousand
times, only before she hadn�t been in such obvious bliss. Everything had worked
out the way she planned, and she had trouble visualizing herself as a
millionaire. What the hell, she thought, she would think of something to do with all that money.
Maybe she would buy a little island in the pacific, and
spend the rest of her life there, in a worry free environment� She suddenly
stopped. Cautiously turning around, she saw two men following her, but as soon
as she turned they had hidden behind a building. This was definitely not
something she rehearsed. She prayed that it was just a fluke and walked, a
little faster, towards the designated spot. Again, they emerged and followed
her, 3 blocks behind.

&nbsp;

Now openly running, she ran into a building, up a flight of
stairs, then back down a different flight of stairs and onto the street.
Quickly checking around, she was relieved to see that she had lost them.
Perfect, she thought and walked up to their rendezvous point. Her plan was to
wait here until Jessica could slip out of the courtroom, and make her way into
their little spot. From there, they would sail away with all that money�

&nbsp;

Walking down the corridor, she hummed to herself as she slid
the key into the lock and opened the door. As soon as she stepped in and closed
the door of the little studio they had rented, she looked up and saw herself
staring into the end of a pistol.

&nbsp;

�Hello, there. Don�t make any noise, and everything will be
just fine. Now be nice and put your hands on your head��

&nbsp;

Horrified, she barely understood what he had said, as she
numbly lifted her hands to her head. Immediately she felt someone behind her,
cuffing her hands. 

&nbsp;

�Look at me� the hypnotic voice of the gunman drawled.
�Recognize me?�

&nbsp;

As she looked up, she recognized the face of the
representative from the huge corporation, the one that she had just signed the
deal with, mere minutes ago. Mr. Gavin. Only now he wasn�t cringing or nervous,
but calm. She felt like a mouse in front of a snake, a snake that was eyeing
her hungrily�

&nbsp;

�You see, we don�t like it when our little business gets
sued. But we also don�t like to make deals with� strangers.� The voice
continued. �Ours is an exclusive family, and after thinking it over, we decided
that you know way too much about our way of doing business. �

&nbsp;

She felt the man behind her put his hand over her mouth, and
struggled against his grip. He effortlessly held her in a headlock, and she
could see Mr. Gavin coming closer to her, his gun now only at his side�

&nbsp;

He calmly took a syringe from his pocket, lifted it to her
neck, and as she felt the sting of the needle, everything began to blur. The
last words she heard before she collapsed completely were �Don�t take this
personally��



&nbsp;



�

&nbsp;

Jessica was elated. All the morons in the jury had listened
to her open mouthed all wishing for this retarded trial ordeal to end. They had
argued for awarding the plaintiff money, and as one jury member eloquently put
it, �lets like give � uh, a billion dollars�. But in
the end, they realized that the longer they argued with Jessica, the longer
they would be stuck in this little room, so finally they all just agreed with
her to get the hell out of this courtroom. To hell with the plaintiff and his
lawsuit, they just wanted to go home.

&nbsp;

She quietly avoided the media and slipped down the same
street Kate had walked minutes before. The two men that Kate had seen were
watching nearby. As she came near an intersection, one of them suddenly walked
out in front of her, staring right at her. She panicked for a second, who is
this guy? She turned around to go another way, to avoid crossing this creep
when she saw another one behind her. Now really panicking, she turned to run,
but the first was suddenly right next to her. He punched her in the stomach,
and winded, Jessica struggled for air. The other threw a bag over her head, and
she passed out seconds later. A van came up the empty street, and they loaded
her body into the back, got in, and sped off. 



&nbsp;



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Mr. Gavin had worked this out weeks ago. He knew of the
importance of the two blackmailers, and he knew exactly what to do to them.
Kate was the real problem, she was the one that had made contact with him, and
signed the actual deal. Jessica, on the other hand, knew nothing. She couldn�t
even tell anyone what she had done, after all she had illegally found her way
onto the jury, influenced them, etc. She was unimportant, and Gavin had decided
to use her as a gift to some of his associates. Kate was his. He knew that the
corporation�s secret was in her, and had decided against killing her. �There
were better uses for her�, he mused. 

&nbsp;




Iniquity: Chapter 1.

&nbsp;

I woke up slowly, my head pounding. I tried to open my eyes,
but I couldn�t see anything! It was dark, smelly� and the ground was moving? I
struggled to stand up but my legs felt too weak, and when I tried to reach my
hand out to support myself, I realized it was tied behind my back. Just when I
realized that I was in fact in the back of some car, with my hands cuffed
behind my back and a hood over my face, I remembered what happened. The trial. Those two creepy men that had somehow knocked me
out, and yes, put me in a van. My heart skipped a beat as I suddenly realized
the real, horrible truth of my situation. I frantically sat up and tried to
free my hands, but nothing would budge. I must have struggled for hours, because
I eventually gave up and just sat still, quietly crying. 

&nbsp;

I must have fallen asleep, because I woke with a start when
the van stopped moving. I nervously tried to make myself as small as possible,
and I could hear voices outside the van. I heard the jingle of keys, and then a
male voice laughing. 

&nbsp;

I was dragged out of the van, put on my feet, and then half
dragged, half carried up a flight of stairs, and then dumped on the floor. I
instinctively curled into a ball, trying my best to be as small as possible.

&nbsp;

�Stand up! I said stand the fuck up!� shouted a voice, and
when I didn�t move he roughly grabbed my hair through the hood and pulled me to
my knees. �When I tell you to do something, you do it, got that?� he growled
into my ear.

&nbsp;

The pain from his grip on my hair was intense, and it was
all I could do to stay quiet. He twisted his hand in my hair, and when he heard
me whimpering he dropped me in disgust.

&nbsp;

�When I take off your hood, you better fucking keep quiet,
ok?�

&nbsp;

I nodded limply, and I felt him reach behind my neck, fumble
with something, and then I had to shut my eyes quickly because it was so
bright. 

&nbsp;

�Poor baby, look at her, she must�ve been cryy-ing during the trip� a voice mocked me. 

&nbsp;

�Lets make her feel better, she
looks so sad� another chimed in. 

&nbsp;

I felt rough hands grabbing my shirt, and I tried to say
something, but my throat was too dry and I could barely make anything out. My
eyes had almost adjusted to the light, and I could see the outlines of what
seemed like hundreds of hands pulling at my shirt.

&nbsp;

In a frenzied rush, I tried to pull myself away from the
hands groping me. I blindly ran in one direction, and as I freed myself from
them I heard my shirt rip.

&nbsp;

I staggered against the wall and squinting, tried to look at
my assailants. There were 3 men, and all of them looked huge compared to me.
I�m only 5� 6�, but these guys looked to be well over 6 feet. They crowded the
little room we were in, and I could make out a door behind them. I suddenly
noticed that they had gone suspiciously quiet, and mustering all my courage I
spoke up,


�I won�t tell anyone. Please, I promise, just let me go� I begged.

&nbsp;

�Oh no� One of them softly growled, slowly coming towards
me. �No, I don�t think so�

&nbsp;

He was 2 feet away from me, moving slowly towards me. He
suddenly reached out and shoved me against the wall.

&nbsp;

�You�re going to do exactly what I say, cunt.� He put his
knee between my legs, moving it up until I was standing on my toes to keep away
from him.

&nbsp;

I turned away from him, but with my hands still cuffed
behind my back I couldn�t move. He grabbed my face and forced me to look at
him.

&nbsp;

�We can do this the easy way, or the hard way. You either be
a good girl, and take off all your clothes, or we do it for you.�

&nbsp;

I could see the other two men behind him smiling. I nodded
desperately, incoherently babbling �yes, yes, please, I�ll be good, yes��

&nbsp;

He stepped back from me, and I cowered against the wall. 

&nbsp;

�Turn around�

&nbsp;

I obediently turned around for him, and he grabbed my wrists
and undid the cuffs.

&nbsp;

�Now I think its time you stopped fooling around. Take off
your clothes, NOW!�

&nbsp;

He yelled the last word, and I almost jumped in fear. Slowly
what he wanted dawned on me, and hesitantly I kicked off my shoes and started
pulling off my jeans. 

&nbsp;

I desperately wished I had worn more clothes, but with the
temperature well in the 90s, I had practically overdressed. Once I had my jeans
and the remains of my shirt in a puddle at my feet, I hesitated with taking off
my bra. 

&nbsp;

�Ok, let�s cut the drama,� one of the tall guys said. He
walked up to me, grabbed my hair and shoved me to my knees. I instinctively
tried to push his hands away from my head, when another walked behind me and
ripped my bra off. 

&nbsp;

�Look, her nipples are hard. I bet she loves this�, and with
a crude laugh he started mauling my tits from behind. 

&nbsp;

The third guy then put his hand on my crotch, and pushed my
panties down to my knees. �Look, she even keeps her hair trimmed. I bet you�ve
been waiting for this all your life.�

&nbsp;

With that the guy holding my hair let go and I lost my
balance, falling face down onto the floor. I heard a zipper being pulled and
then I felt something shoving at my ass. I tried desperately to somehow move
away, but I felt something else enter my pussy. 

&nbsp;

�Oh god... no... please� I moaned
as the second man started fucking my pussy. Distracted by him, the first guy
managed to stick his cock into my ass, and slowly, painfully, began shoving it
up.

&nbsp;

The third guy moved around to the front, where I was getting
fucked doggy-style in both holes. He took my head in his hands and shoved his
cock near my mouth. By then I was so distracted by the other two pounding my
holes that I barely even noticed his cock inches from my face. 

&nbsp;

I suddenly felt him grab my nipples, hard and start pinching
them. �Suck it or you're gonna really get hurt� he growled. 

&nbsp;

Instinctively I took his dick in my mouth and sucked for all
I was worth. He relaxed his grip on my nipples and started fucking my face. 

&nbsp;

I could feel the man behind me start panting heavily, and
then suddenly he grunted and I could feel his cock explode in my ass. He pulled
his cock out, still spurting cum, and covered my back in his sticky fluid. 

&nbsp;

After all three covered me in their cum,
they dumped me in a corner of the room and opened several cans of beer. I lay
huddled in a pile of their cum, sobbing to myself. 

&nbsp;

They were talking loudly, pointing at me and laughing to
themselves, but I didn't understand a word of what they said. I was alternating
between the fear of being left in the corner like this, and what would happen
when they noticed me again.

&nbsp;

Eventually one of them went up to me, squatted near my face
and looked me in the eye.

&nbsp;

�Be a good girl, and open your mouth� he asked me, almost
gently. 

&nbsp;

I was so scared I obeyed him, not even thinking about it. He
took a ball gag and forced it into my mouth, stretching my jaws open wide.

&nbsp;

Apparently satisfied, he went back to where the other two
were drinking beer. He whispered something to them, and they all laughed,
looking at me. I tensed in apprehension at what they were planning.

&nbsp;

Finally one of them came up to me, grabbed my hair in one
hand, and with the other clamped my nose shut. I couldn't breathe. Panicking, I
started to thrash my legs but he just held on. Just as everything was beginning
to spin slightly he let go of my nose and I breathed in deeply, through my
nose. As soon as I breathed in I sneezed violently and then breathed in again.
I could feel mucus seeping out of my nose. 

&nbsp;

Apparently, another guy had put a small plate in front of my
nose, and when I inhaled I had snorted whatever he put on that plate. I could
see him still holding the plate, grinning stupidly. 

&nbsp;

After that, I felt like I was floating somewhere far away.
My mind was completely blank, and when they alternated fucking me from behind,
I even enjoyed it. I was fucking a storm, and whenever I felt like I would pass
out, they forced me to snort some more. 

&nbsp;

Eventually I felt everything go black. I must have passed
out, because I woke up jammed in the trunk of some car. 

&nbsp;

It came to a stop, and when he opened the trunk, it was dark
outside.

&nbsp;

He grabbed me by whatever part of me wasn't covered in cum,
pulled me onto the road, and shoved me face down in the gutter. 

&nbsp;

�Later, cunt. It was fun� he said
with a smile, kicked me in the groin, and then got back in the car and sped
away. 

&nbsp;

I was totally naked on the side of the road, and I tried to
ask for help, but when I opened my mouth all that came out was a mix of cum,
saliva, and urine. I was vaguely confused about the piss, I couldn't remember
anyone pissing in my mouth; but then there was a lot that I didn't remember. I
tried to crawl somewhere, to hide myself and then die in the corner, but I soon
passed out, mere feet from where I had been dumped.



&nbsp;



�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I woke up suddenly. The first thing I remembered was Gavin,
approaching me with a needle. He was saying something, but I couldn't remember
a word. Then, nothing. 

&nbsp;

Opening my eyes, I looked around, and noticed that I was
tied, spread-eagled on a bed. That didn't seem too surprising; I didn't doubt
Gavin was the kind of creep that would do something like this.

&nbsp;

I didn't have to wait too long to find out; soon the door
opened and Gavin, with another man walked into the room. The other man had had
long, black hair, sharp blue eyes, and a totally expressionless face. 

&nbsp;

�What the FUCK do you think you're doing to me!� I yelled as soon as they came in. 

&nbsp;

They barely looked up, so I continued �Let me go, you sick
bastard�

&nbsp;

Gavin muttered something to his pal, and he smiled. Then the
long haired guy walked up to the bed I was tied on, pulled something out of his
pocket, and held it over my mouth. 

&nbsp;

His face was literally on top of me, and I could feel his
eyes staring at me intensely. 

&nbsp;

�Open your mouth� he said softly. I didn't dare, I knew he
would try and gag me somehow. 

&nbsp;

Patiently, as if disciplining a small child, he reached out
and pinched my nose. I tried to move my head away but he held on. Eventually I
opened my mouth and he shoved the dildo into my mouth. 

&nbsp;

Apparently satisfied, he drew back and continued his
conversation.

&nbsp;

�...Not bad, considering the background you gave me. But not
great, you understand?� said the long haired one.

&nbsp;

�Look, Jim, I gave you 300 pages on her. What do you see now
that you didn't see in the countless psychological, physical, and mental
evaluations about a dozen shrinks gave on her?� said Gavin, apparently
frustrated.

&nbsp;

�Just relax, ok? I'm trying to keep my options open� said
Jim, smiling slightly.

&nbsp;

�Whatever. You done here?� asked Gavin, but Jim was already
half way towards the door. 

&nbsp;

After I heard the door slam, I remembered their conversation
about me. What did they think they were doing, sharing 300 page files on me?
Was Gavin trying to convince Jim about something? What was in that 300 page document
anyway? I wanted to read what the shrinks had to say about me...

&nbsp;

My thoughts were interrupted by the door opening again. Two
black men, dressed like gangsters walked in. Behind them was a stunning blond
that was completely naked, except for some ridiculously high heels, and
stockings.

&nbsp;

Without a word, the blond got up on the bed, and started
attaching something around my neck. I tried to say something through my gag,
but she didn't appear to notice. She was straddling me on the bed, and didn't
seem to care that I was staring right at her pussy. I looked away, ashamed, but
found myself peeking at it anyway.

&nbsp;

Meanwhile, the two black men had positioned themselves on
either side of the bed. They unhooked my hands, which were tied at the two ends
of the bed. 

&nbsp;

After the blond had finished attaching what felt like a
collar, she slid back a little and started taking off my shirt. I tried to stop
her, but my hands would barely move; they were still sore from being tied in
place for so long.

&nbsp;

Once the blond had my shirt off, she started taking off my
bra. This had gone too far, so I tried to sit up and punch this weird whore or
something. I wasn't going down without a fight, I reasoned. 

&nbsp;

As soon as the two guys noticed my hands were out of the
shirt, they grabbed my wrists and cuffed them to my collar. Then, one of them
pulled the collar back onto the bed, and fastened it to the head of the bed. 

&nbsp;

The only sounds in the room were my own heavy breathing, and
the sound of the blond working to pull my legs out of my pants. This was
completely insane. 

&nbsp;

After she had my pants around my ankles, she pulled my
panties all the way down, and got off the bed. 

&nbsp;

One of the guys, (guards I figured) got bored and started
playing with my tits. His hands would roam all over them, occasionally
fingering my nipples. I tried to say something, but he just could not keep his
hands off my tits. 

&nbsp;

�What you doin'� the other guard
asked, looking up.

&nbsp;

�Just getting to know her� he answered, without looking up �whats wrong with you? Are you gay or something?�

&nbsp;

�Don't you ever get tired?� the other one asked, bored. �You
like some kind of machine, man. What, 5 minutes ago you were screwing some
whore, and now you still horny?�

&nbsp;

The first guard just ignored him and started squeezing my nipples.
I gasped through my gag as he pulled it hard, too hard. I squirmed to relieve
the pressure on my nipples, with no success.

&nbsp;

�Look, she likes this� he added helpfully. �she's movin' around or something�

&nbsp;

The other guard just shook his head and continued messing
with something in his hand. �Wheres Kelly?� he asked
suddenly. The first guard didn't seem to care, he was
squeezing my nipples so hard I had tears in my eyes.

&nbsp;

Finally the blond came back, holding something, but I was
too distracted to notice what. 

&nbsp;

Suddenly I felt her touching my pussy, and realized she was
trying to shave it. I almost started crying, why was this all happening?

&nbsp;

Eventually, the guard let go of my tits and started pacing
around the room, almost like he was expecting something. I quickly lost
interest in him when the blond whore, Kelly, started really feeling around. She
found my clit, and started flicking it. I could see the faintest outline of a
smile on her face.

&nbsp;

Despite myself, I was getting wet. I couldn't believe I could
possibly be getting excited with another woman touching me, but even as I
thought that I let out an involuntary moan. 

&nbsp;

Just as quickly as she started, she stopped. Apparently
finished shaving me, she got up and stood near the wall. I noticed she averted
her eyes, away from any of the guards, or me.

&nbsp;

The second guard finally looked up, saw that Kelly was done,
and motioning to the other guard he went to my ankles and removed the cuffs
holding them to the ends of the bed. Once they were free, he attached a lead to
my collar and pulled me off the bed. My legs were still sore, and I collapsed,
my hands useless and chained to my neck.

&nbsp;

He didn't seem to notice that I had fallen, and kept pulling
on the lead. Finally realizing that I wasn't getting up, he grabbed a chunk of
my hair, and dragged me out of the room.

&nbsp;

I regained the use of my legs about halfway through the
corridor, but he didn't seem to care either. He just continued pulling me by my
hair until we reached a door. Then, he released my hands from my neck, removed
the gag, and literally threw me into the room. 

&nbsp;

As I picked myself off the floor, another person staggered
into the little cell, and then the door slammed.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I edged away into the corner, staring at my apparent
cell-mate. I was shocked when I noticed it was Kelly.

&nbsp;

Coughing slightly, I cleared my throat and asked, �what the hell are you doing in here?�

&nbsp;

She seemed shy, unwilling to look at me. 

&nbsp;

�I, um, live here� she mumbled.

&nbsp;

�What?� I asked. �What is this place... why am I here?�

&nbsp;

She finally looked at me, and smiled shyly. �I don�t know�
she said a little louder. �They just spend their time making us do stuff�� she
trailed off, and looked at the ground again.

&nbsp;

�'us'?� I asked, incredulously. �who's this 'us'? What are you, some kind of sex toy?�

&nbsp;

�I'm sorry� she suddenly. �I haven't been here long.� She
looked around the room, as if searching for something else to talk about.

&nbsp;

I wasn't taking this crap, I said to myself. Standing up, I
walked over to where Kelly was sitting and almost yelled, �I said, what is this
place!�

&nbsp;

Shaking her head, she started inching away from me. I was
furious, this bitch was obviously working for Gavin, or Jim,
or whatever creeps that ran this place. I grabbed her neck and started
squeezing, panting �Tell.. me...
what... this... place... is!�

&nbsp;

She weakly pushed back against my hands, her eyes now filled
with fear. I realized that she obviously couldn't answer me while I was choking
her, but I didn't care. I just kept pushing, squeezing her stupid little neck.
Her legs were jerking behind me, and I could see her face turning blue. There
were tears coming out of her eyes.

&nbsp;

I kept choking her, completely insane with anger now. I
wanted to kill this bitch, choke her until she died.

&nbsp;

I didn't even hear the cell door burst open, and only
realized that there was someone in the room when I felt a guard punch me in the
back. Falling on her in pain, I was hauled out of the room by a guard,
breathless. Just as I was pulled from the cell, I looked back and saw Kelly,
now on her stomach, coughing into the ground. Just as she turned her head to
look at me the cell door slammed shut and cut off my view of her.

&nbsp;

�What the FUCK were you doing� the guard kept asking me as
he slapped my face. I couldn't answer, the vision of Kelly lying there still in
my eyes. He dragged me into another room, threw me in, and came in after me. 

&nbsp;

Pulling my hands over my head, he attached them to a hook in
the ceiling and pulled until I could barely reach the ground with my toes. 

&nbsp;

�Jesus, what the fuck is wrong with you� he spat as he gave
me a final slap and left the room, slamming the door. 

&nbsp;

I had little time to ponder what I had done, when Jim and
Gavin came into the room. Gavin was smoking now; he looked at me like I was
some specimen in a zoo.

&nbsp;

Jim, on the other hand, was rubbing his hands. He looked
like an excited freak, and kept licking his lips like a maniac. 


�Perfect� he said. �This is amazing. How much?� he asked, looking at Gavin.

&nbsp;

�We agreed on a price� Gavin said slowly, his look of utter
confusion at Jim's response quickly vanishing as he blew smoke at me.

&nbsp;

�Awesome. Great, just great!� Jim
exclaimed, he was almost yelling now. 

&nbsp;

�Ok, then, its a deal?� asked
Gavin, his eyes a little wider as he stared at Jim in shock.

&nbsp;

�Deal, deal, mine, YES!� Jim
suddenly burst out. He was laughing now, spit flying
out of his mouth.

&nbsp;

Gavin considered him again, then
said quickly �done. I'm out of here.�

&nbsp;

He left the room without a backward glance. Jim, barely even
noticed him leave. �Oh yes Gavin, its a deal, yes,
deal... HA!� he looked suddenly, and finding Gavin gone, he turned around and
stared directly into my eyes. His small blue eyes shining, I could see the
excitement in his eyes. 

&nbsp;

He kept staring at me, so I looked away. Finally, as if
snapping out of a trance, he abruptly walked out of the room muttering.

&nbsp;

The guard came back in, whistling. �Man, you don't see the
boss like that everyday.�

&nbsp;

He unhooked my hands from the ceiling, and let me crumple at
his feet. This guard was the excitable one, the one that obsessed with my tits
earlier. His breath smelled of beer, and he looked totally drunk.

&nbsp;

�This calls for some celebration!� he announced, and
unzipping his fly with joy, pulled his cock out and rammed it down my throat.

&nbsp;

Caught completely by surprise, I gagged reflexively and
started to choke. He just kept pushing his cock in, until it touched the back
of my throat and kept going. I was really gagging now, I couldn't breathe at
all.

&nbsp;

He barely seemed to notice, and when he pulled his cock out,
he was about to ram it back in when he noticed that I had emptied the contents
of my stomach onto his pants.

&nbsp;

�Ugh, nasty, you fucking slut!� he yelled, and kicked me,
trying to wipe the barf out of his pants.

&nbsp;

The other guard walked in, and seeing the mess his friend
made, burst out laughing. 

&nbsp;

�You goddam moron, this bitch
probably never had a cock in her mouth before� he laughed. The other guard was
still busy wiping my barf off his pants.

&nbsp;

Giving his friend another look, he picked me up roughly,
wiped my mouth with a dirty rag, and then walked me back to my cell. I was in a
daze and didn't protest at all. Before he opened the door of my cell, he pinned
me against the wall.

&nbsp;

�Whatever you do, don't choke Kelly, ok?� and laughing, he
opened the door and threw me into the cell.

&nbsp;

Still momentarily dazed I just blindly moved to the wall and
sat down against the wall. Kelly was lying on the floor nearby, and when she
saw me move towards her she almost ran to the other side of the cell.

&nbsp;

I was still trying to get the awful taste out of my mouth,
and somehow digest what I had seen and done in the last half-hour. 

&nbsp;

Kelly broke my reverie by saying in a choking voice, �I...
I'm sorry, Kate�

&nbsp;

�Huh?� I looked up without understanding her.

&nbsp;

This time she looked back at me, with tears still streaking
down her face. 

&nbsp;

�I don't know� she whispered. �I'm sorry... I didn't want to
hurt you...� She buried her face in her hands again and continued sobbing.

&nbsp;

I was so dazed I hardly heard her, the image of Jim ranting
still clouding my mind. I was reliving the guard forcing his cock down my
throat; my thoughts all jumbled and confused...

&nbsp;

I slept fitfully that night, waking occasionally to the
sound of Kelly sobbing in the corner.

Iniquity: Chapter 2 Part 1

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I woke with a start when the cell door banged open. One of
the guards walked in. I braced myself for him to grab
me, but instead he went toward Kelly. Her eyes red with tears, and she
obediently let herself get dragged out of the cell. I stared after her in some
disbelief; why was she so compliant? On one hand, I felt sorry for her, after
all, I did try to kill her. On the other, her attitude infuriated me. She was
so... submissive. 

&nbsp;

I stood up and looked around the little cell objectively,
for the first time. It was small, hardly 10' by 10',
no windows, and the door had no handle on the inside. I scoured the inside,
following the wall with my hand, hoping that this would turn out like some
novel where the cell has a secret passage coming out of it. 

&nbsp;

I circled the cell several times, sliding my hand along the
wall. This clearly was no novel; there was no movable tile; no hidden passage.
Not even a secret message written on toilet paper, not that I expected to find
one.

&nbsp;

The door burst open again, startling me. This time I knew it
had to be for me, and sure enough the guard went up to me and grabbed my
collar. I tried to push his hand away, but he ignored my protests and almost
lifted me off my feet by the collar. I was panting slightly, the collar biting
into my neck, choking me.

&nbsp;

�Jim was right about you. You sure got more balls than
Kelly,� he said in a gruff voice. He looked at me strangely, as if admiring
some particularly feisty zoo animal. He let me down slowly, my hands still
trying to free my collar from his big hairy arm.

&nbsp;

�C'mon, lets go. Jim's waiting.� He
winked and dragged me out of the cell. Once outside, he attached a leash to my
collar. I tried to hold back a cough; I wasn't showing him any sign of
weakness, but that just made it worse. I coughed loudly, my eyes tearing
slightly. Brushing away a tear, I looked back at him defiantly. He just shook
his head, and almost ripped mine off as he pulled on the leash and walked me
down the hall.

&nbsp;

�You should really save your strength. I mean I can't say
what Jim's gonna do, y'know, but he's the one you
should be fighting, not me� he said as we walked down the hall.

&nbsp;

I said nothing. He was right, but I would never admit it to
him. Besides, I was out of breath from being dragged by my neck.

&nbsp;

As we rounded the corner he whistled slightly and slowed
down, pulling even harder on the leash. I struggled to look past him at what
was down the hall, but I could only see his sweaty gray shirt.

&nbsp;

He came to a stop, and finally able to breathe normally, I
took the time to catch my breath and look around. We were standing in front of
a wooden door with an ornate handle. There were two white guys standing in
front of it, one holding a small suitcase. They could not be more different.

&nbsp;

One was tall, muscular, a mean expression on his face. The
other was shorter, had a more boyish face, and an odd smile that made me shiver
inside.

&nbsp;

�She's all yours, buddy. Watch out, she a little more jumpy
than-�

&nbsp;

�Shut the fuck up.� The tall guy said, unimpressed. He
grabbed the leash from my guard and waved him away. My guard obediently turned
around and left, looking over his shoulder as he went.

&nbsp;

My view of the guard walking down the hall was cut short
when the leash went taut and I was dragged into the room, the skinny guy
following me in, shutting the door behind him.

&nbsp;

The room seemed larger than my cell; it had a pleasant aroma
and was brightly lit. I was dumped into a chair, and my leash unfastened. Then, surprisingly, nothing. No restraints. I looked in
front of me and was almost shocked to see a large desk covered in paperwork. A
guy in glasses was busily working behind it; he didn't seem to notice us as we
came in, as if used to seeing naked women dragged into his office.

&nbsp;

The small guy with the suitcase carefully rested the
suitcase against the desk, and sat down on a stool to the side of it. The other
one had disappeared from my view, which I figured was probably a good thing. I
looked at the guy busily writing at the desk more closely. He seemed very
familiar, but I couldn't place him.

&nbsp;

He suddenly put his pen down with a snap and looked right up
into my eyes. It was Jim. The same small blue eyes, the same creepy stare. Only this time with glasses. He would have looked funny if I
weren�t sitting naked in a chair in front of him. I opened my mouth to say
something, but decided against it. Not yet.

&nbsp;

�Let's see... #36, Kate?� he said looking up. �How are you?�
he asked randomly.

&nbsp;

�I'm fi-� I started to say but he cut me off. 

&nbsp;

�Good. We have nothing scheduled, so lets
get right to business� he said briskly. �Starting with your set of rules; I
expect to you to obey these at all times� he said matter-of-factly, and busied
himself with a paper.

&nbsp;

�Make me� I responded, defiantly, my voice shaking slightly.
I wasn't rolling over like some dumb blond whore.

&nbsp;

�What, you haven't even heard these rules, and you're
already bitching?� he asked, smiling.

&nbsp;

Before I even had a chance to respond, I felt the chair,
with me in it, fly across the room. I landed painfully against the opposite
wall, the huge white guy looking after me with pleasure. I yelped in pain and
shock, trying to untangle myself from the chair.

&nbsp;

Struggling out of the remains of my chair, I sat up
awkwardly. I glared at Jim, who was giggling like a little kid. Pulling my hand
out of the debris that once was my chair, I gave him the finger.

&nbsp;

Before I could even judge his reaction, I felt someone pick
me up and slam me against the wall. I felt a rush of pain around my nose, and felt
a little dazed. Then the guard then slammed me against the wall again, this
time holding me against it with his hand under the back of my neck. I could see
blood where he had broken my nose against the wall.

&nbsp;

Disoriented, I pushed back against the wall with my hands,
with no success. My head was now turned sideways against the wall, my tits
getting crushed as I struggled to free myself. 

&nbsp;

I was suddenly staring into the face of Jim, his glasses no
longer on him. �It would have been so much easier if you simply obeyed� he
crooned, his hand reaching out and patting my face. My face contorted with
fury, I tried to spit at his hand. He pulled his now bloody hand back, wiping
it on my hair. 

&nbsp;

The guard dropped me unexpectedly; I fell like a sack of
bricks. He then picked me up, and pushed me face down on Jim's desk. Papers
flew everywhere, I heard glass smash and a warm feeling near my belly, he must have thrown me right on some glass ornament on Jim's
desk. 

&nbsp;

My face hanging off the edge of the desk, my legs spread at
the opposite end, I saw Jim slowly walk around toward the front of the desk and
sit down. He was no longer smiling, my face level with his chest, staring
directly at him.

&nbsp;

I twisted to get off the table, but the guard was holding me
down with one hand. Jim grabbed my hair and forced me to look in his eyes.

&nbsp;

I gasped and my eyes went round with shock, someone was
entering me from behind! The guard behind me was slowly forcing his cock up my
ass, painfully inching his way forward.

&nbsp;

Jim breathed in sharply, as if taking in my expression of
shock. He then dropped my hair, and my head fell forward painfully. I no longer
saw his face; I only felt the pain of what seemed like a baseball bat, shoving
its way up my ass. I screamed in pain, tears streaming down my face. I felt the
intruder recede, then force its way right up again, causing my entire body to
lurch forward as he pounded my ass.

&nbsp;

I was out of breath, screaming each time he pushed forward.
I could hear Jim reading something, but I understood nothing I heard.

&nbsp;

� -- you have no choice --� 

&nbsp;

I yelled out as the pain reached new heights. Saliva was
pouring out of my mouth, my face covered in sweat. I could taste a salty
liquid, the tears mingling with blood from my broken nose, dripping into my
mouth.

&nbsp;

� -- learn to obey--�

&nbsp;

His cock ramming faster and faster up my ass, I could no
longer scream. Closing my eyes tightly I could only gasp each time he pushed me
forward.

&nbsp;

As he thrusted even harder up my ass, I felt something enter my mouth. Looking up, I
could make out the blurry outline of Jim putting a dental gag in my mouth. My
jaws were suddenly stretched as wide as they would go, and staring past my
tears I could see him stand up and pull his zipper down. Oh god, not this...

&nbsp;

He put his warm cock in my mouth, not, pushing, just letting
it sit there. The guy behind me was still grinding his cock up my ass, pushing
me slightly forward with each thrust. Jim's cock was expanding as my tongue
involuntarily brushed past it. 

&nbsp;

He then slowly started edging it down my throat. I gagged as
he slowly, firmly, pushed it further and further down my throat. The man behind
me was breathing heavily now; I could feel his cock start to pulsate inside me.
He was close, but Jim was taking his time, slowly edging it down my throat. 

&nbsp;

He pushed too far and I could no longer control the gag
reflex, he quickly pulled his cock out of my mouth and jumped back as I threw
up at his feet. Behind me, the guard had spent his cock inside my ass, and was
slowly pulling out.

&nbsp;

I moaned softly, utterly exhausted. The pain near my belly
had intensified, and I limply tried to roll over, with no success.

&nbsp;

Jim sat down and looked into my face, almost hopefully.
Seeing him brought back all my hatred and I tried to sit up on the table. I
wanted to rip this mans head off, but I could barely move my hands. I fell back
onto the table, my head falling forward.

&nbsp;

I heard Jim sigh, and he motioned toward the skinny guy who
had so far done nothing but watch with little interest.

&nbsp;

He immediately opened his little suitcase and started
pulling things out.

&nbsp;

I heard Jim talking to someone, and looking up I saw him
leafing through some papers, shouldering a phone.

&nbsp;

�Yeah, hi, this is Jim� he barked into the phone.

&nbsp;

The small guy was now holding a syringe, slowly filling it
from a little bottle in his suitcase.

&nbsp;

�...No, not going well. I don't want to really damage her,
but this won't work....�

&nbsp;

Good, I thought to myself. He wasn't getting through to me.
I looked back at the guy messing with his suitcase; he was now pulling on latex
gloves.

&nbsp;

�...Exactly, yeah. I know, you told
me. Yeah. Listen, I want to hold off on the hormone therapy for now...�

&nbsp;

Hormone therapy? What? Was he going
to turn me into a man? The only thing that rang a bell when I thought of
hormone therapy were those freak-shows where people
had sex-change operations...

&nbsp;

Now that he had his gloves on, the small guy ripped open a
small packet, and walked towards me. Oh no, this can't be happening. I moaned
into my gag, too weak to move.

&nbsp;

�...What? Anyway, so yeah I'm going to do the usual
anti-psychotic treatment for now, we can usually work it through that way. Zi-lo-something
something. I can't pronounce it. No, it won't really hurt her...�

&nbsp;

I was relieved it wasn't any hormones... anti-psychotic? What
even is that? I looked behind me; the small guy was rubbing a spot on my ass.
He went back to his suitcase, and pulled the needle out, tapping it.

&nbsp;

�...Great. Ok. Keep in touch.� Jim hung up and looked at me,
his blue eyes narrow and his face twisted in a depraved smile.

&nbsp;

I looked back to see the small guy position the needle at my
ass, and squeeze the liquid inside me. The spot where he injected me stung a
little. I moaned, unable to stop him from. Oh my god, what was he doing to me?
I started crying again; I felt so helpless and afraid...

&nbsp;

�All done. I'll be back tomorrow in
case you need me.� With that, the small guy closed his suitcase and left the
room. 

&nbsp;

Jim looked around, kicked some papers that had fallen off
his desk, and left the room. The room was quiet now; I felt it darken. What was
happening? I was still lying on the desk, in the same position they had left me
in. 

&nbsp;

I started to shiver, sweating at the same time. My head felt
heavy... too heavy. There seemed to be something pushing my head down...
down... I heard someone come into the room, breaking the reverie. 

&nbsp;

�Whoa, Kate, they trashed you good this time� he said, a
little shocked by the mess he saw. I didn't recognize him, but he didn't seem
too bad. He was a tall black guy, sweating into his plain gray shirt. I could
vaguely remember him... but in my memories he wasn't nice at all. 

&nbsp;

My eyes rolled into my head, I felt myself lose control of
my muscles� I felt a growing wetness near my crotch, and then my head banged
forward, everything sliding out of focus.

&nbsp;



&nbsp;



&nbsp;

Iniquity: Chapter 2 Part 2

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I woke up right where I had been dumped, in the side of the
road. Every part of me ached, and there was an awful pounding in my head. I
slowly, painfully, pulled myself onto my hands and knees. There was a
disgusting taste in my mouth; there was a nasty smell in the air around me.

&nbsp;

It was dark outside, the narrow road forbidding and silent.
I shivered, sitting down on the side of the road, holding myself to keep warm.
There was a slight breeze that was making me numb; it was just barely strong
enough to keep me from ever feeling warm.

&nbsp;

I looked down the road, seeing nothing. My eyes were almost
covered with a crusty substance, even if it wasn�t so
dark I doubted I could see much. Then, I saw a light, far away in the distance.
A street lamp? Why did it suddenly turn on, I though
to myself. I watched it intently; there was little else I could do.

&nbsp;

It was growing bigger and bigger, now splitting into two
separate lights. Was I imagining this? I looked again and suddenly realized it
was a car, heading right at me.

&nbsp;

I heard an awful screeching sound as I stood up, and holding
my hand out in front of me, saw the car hit me lightly. I fell into the
pavement, more from surprise than from any real pain, waiting for the car to
crush me. I looked up and saw the car, literally on top of me, but not moving.

&nbsp;

The door opened, and someone got out of the car hurriedly,
holding a cell phone to his ear.

&nbsp;

�...Anti-psychotics? Who the fuck asked you for
anti-psychotics?� the man said into his cell phone. It was ridiculous,
he was talking into his cell phone while slowly walking towards me, his eyes
glued to me but his thoughts clearly far away.

&nbsp;

�...Ok, Jim, no. This is retarded.
Since when do you - , look, how am I supposed to know the name?�

&nbsp;

He squatted in front of me, still talking on the phone, but
now staring right into my eyes.

&nbsp;

�...no, Jim listen-, ok. I have to
go, all right just don't kill her. If I wanted her dead you're the last on my
list. All right. Bye.� He closed his cell phone and
put it in his pocket. He was so close to me I could smell the alcohol on his
breath. 

&nbsp;

He then straightened up, and sat on the hood of his car,
reaching into his pocket for something.

&nbsp;

�Hello, Jessica. Never thought I'd see you here,� he said,
without looking at me. He was now searching his other pocket for something,
seemingly preoccupied.

&nbsp;

I looked away quickly. How did he know me? I had never seen
this guy before. Who was he...?

&nbsp;

I looked up and gasped in shock. He was still sitting on the
hood of his car, but now he was pointing a gun at me. I gasped,
everything looked so strange, illuminated only by the car's headlights.

&nbsp;

�You were supposed to disappear, Jess. I wasn't supposed to
see you again� he said evenly, then added almost to himself
�those bastards never do anything right on their own...�

&nbsp;

�Please... don't...� I whispered, crying all of a sudden. I
was so scared; he seemed so angry with me about something. I saw his hand
twitch slightly, the pistol made an echoing clicking sound. I closed my eyes,
waiting for him to shoot. My entire life, gone. I
couldn�t fathom the fact that I would not be here, I would not exist, I would be some lifeless lump to be talked about on the
morning news.

&nbsp;

It seemed like ages passed, I was now loudly sobbing on the
ground. It was such a waste, such a waste... I looked up when I heard a voice.

&nbsp;

�This is Gavin. Hi, didn't mean to wake you up. Get over
here, now.� He was barking into his cell phone again, I could see his blurry
outline past my tears.

&nbsp;

The gun was no longer in his hand,
it had disappeared together with his slightly drunken voice. Had I imagined the
whole thing? I picked myself off the ground, sitting up a little.

&nbsp;

�...That�s what I told you, freaking moron. I said 'get rid
of her', not 'dump her on the side of the road for the cops to find'. Now shut
up, and follow my cell phone.� He clicked his cell phone shut, and put it in
his pocket. Looking back at me, he studied my face intently.

&nbsp;

I wanted to say something, anything, to make him go away,
but I was too scared. He was calmly sitting on the hood of his car, watching
me, not moving. It was all too strange, the way he apparently tried to kill me,
twice. He had first hit me with his car, the second time even pointing a gun at
me; both times stopping in the last second.

&nbsp;

The quiet was broken by the sound of a loud van coming up
behind Gavin's car. He stood up, straightened his tie, and looked toward the
van as two men got out. They were both dressed impeccably in dark suits, their
eyes hidden behind dark glasses. They seemed nervous, and stood in front of
Gavin, waiting.

&nbsp;

He returned their questioning looks, and then nodded at me.
They both came toward me, holding me under my arms.

&nbsp;

�Follow my car.� Gavin quickly walked into driver�s seat of
his car, slamming the door. The two men hurriedly pulled me into the van, and
got into the front seats. There was no divider between them and me, they were
obviously not afraid of me doing anything to stop them. I could see the
taillights of Gavin's car already in the distance.

&nbsp;

��Follow my car'� one of the said in an exaggerated tone,
and burst into nervous laughter. �Does this guy practice in front of a mirror?�
the other one chimed in.

&nbsp;

They both looked so different when they weren't in front of
Gavin. Both lost the grim look, the calm air of superiority. One of the even
turned on the radio, the sound of music floated down the van.

&nbsp;

I leaned against the back of the van, breathing deeply.
There were stacks of books, boxes filled with strange equipment, all sitting in
the back of the van with me. This ride seemed so familiar, it bounced in the
same way, only then it had been totally silent except for the sound of the
engine. Now, I could hear them conversing in the front, drowning out the sound
of the radio.

&nbsp;

�... And then the guy just breaks down, he's all crying and
shit. 'No, mommy'� one of them started in a high voice, and they both laughed
loudly.

&nbsp;

They were quiet for a few seconds, the sound of an upbeat
song filling the emptiness.

&nbsp;

�Dude, it smells in here,� one of them said, and turning all
the way around he looked at me. 

&nbsp;

�No kidding dude, you saw what they did to her� the other
responded. He also turned around to look at me too, ignoring the road.

&nbsp;

�Ok, look, it was my idea, and now that I think about it,
not my best� he laughed. �She smells worse than that Asian slut we got last
time.�

&nbsp;

�You mean the Japanese one, �take-it-da-sushi-roll��
the driver imitated horribly. They were both laughing in the front, ignoring me
trying to be as small as possible in the back of the van.

&nbsp;

I noticed it had gone quiet in the front,
both had calmed down somewhat, no longer laughing.

&nbsp;

�This is horrible. The van stinks, dude� the driver said,
annoyed. His friend fished around in the glove compartment, and pulling out a
small bottle he threw it at me. 

&nbsp;

The bottle bounced on the floor and rolled towards me. I
picked it up; it was a men�s aerosol deodorant. I squeezed the trigger
experimentally, a cloud of vapor landed on my hand. It had a strong smell, not
unpleasant, but very powerful. Looking up, I saw the guy still staring at me.

&nbsp;

�Does she even speak English?� he asked the driver, laughing
slightly. The driver just buried his head in the wheel, shaking with laughter.

&nbsp;

The guy walked out of his seat, and squatted near me. �Take
bottle, and spray� he said slowly, motioning with his hands, as if to a child. 

&nbsp;

I hesitantly held the bottle in my hand. He silently
laughed, throwing his head back. Taking the bottle from me, he violently pushed
it up against my face and started spraying.

&nbsp;

The spray hit my face, and my eyes began to burn. I yelped
in pain, holding my hands to my head, the spray going into my mouth. It had a
bitter taste that left me coughing violently. The guy just kept holding it up
to me, spraying my face like there was no tomorrow.

&nbsp;

When he stopped spraying, I could hear the driver banging
the wheel in uproarious laughter. The guy near me was nervously giggling. 

&nbsp;

My eyes were burning, I felt like I was being suffocated.
The strong odor was overpowering my nose, I tried to shake my head to get the
smell off, but nothing worked. I thrashed around, my hands over my eyes, my
throat burning as I inhaled the fume.

&nbsp;

�Uhh... she's going all weird� the
guy said nervously. The driver was still laughing, his head banging on the
wheel. He honked by accident. �Is this stuff safe? Boss is gonna kill us if she
dies� he said, real concern in his voice now.

&nbsp;

�Dies? You freaking idiot, gimme
the bottle� the driver said. There was a scuffle, and then I heard him reading
�'Avoid spraying in eyes and excessive inhalation.' Wow buddy, you're pretty
damn smart� he snarled angrily. �'...Concentrating and inhaling can be harmful
or fatal'� he continued, then suddenly laughed. �This
stuff is harmless, theres a bigger warning on my
toothpaste.�

&nbsp;

�She�s turning blue� his friend replied, his voice scared.
He slapped me in the face several times, and my hand slipped from my eye. I
could barely breathe, the aroma suffocating me; tears were flowing out of my
eyes. I breathed in raggedly, then coughed several
times. I opened my eye slowly, the pain still overwhelming me. 

&nbsp;

�She's fine� the guy announced, and moved back to the front.
�Whew, I thought we were fucked back then� he said, and sighed dramatically.
The driver had rolled down the window and was hanging his hand out, shaking his
head.

&nbsp;

I huddled closer to the side of the van, wiping my eyes. The
smell from the deodorant was still heavy, but no longer suffocating me. I
looked up to see the guy in front still staring at me. It was lighter outside,
the sky was gray and drops of rain were coming from the open window.

&nbsp;

We continued for a while in silence; I stared out the window
at the lane markings on the highway. My eyes were no longer burning, they just
itched uncomfortably; my throat was dry, the bitter taste still lingering in my
mouth.

&nbsp;

We continued in silence for awhile, the radio no longer on.
We soon got off the highway, and followed the black BMW in front of us. We
turned into the driveway of a large house, continued past an open gate, and stopped
in front of a side entrance. Gavin got out of the car in front of us, and the
two men also stepped out of the van. I could hear their conversation through
the open window.

&nbsp;

�You two smell like... you just smell� came
Gavin's voice. They offered some hurried excuses, and then the side door of the
house opened and a tall guy came out. He had long hair, a goatee, and wore
small black sunglasses. 

&nbsp;

Gavin quickly turned away from his two friends and
approached the newcomer. �Hey, Jason, it's been awhile� he said politely.

&nbsp;

The longhaired guy, Jason, didn't answer at first. He looked
towards the van, then back at Gavin. �Lemme guess,
you have another one you don't know what to do with.�

&nbsp;

Gavin nodded politely, �Are you already booked or something?
I'm sure you have room for another.� I had no idea what they were talking
about.

&nbsp;

�You know I already have one� he growled. �You came here
last week with Monica. Where do you get them?� He sounded slightly annoyed, but
he also sounded like he enjoyed the Gavin�s little visits more than he
admitted.

&nbsp;

�Hey, you've had more than two at one time before� Gavin
responded. Two people? Jason was going to 'have' me?

&nbsp;

Jason clearly consented, but didn't say anything. He walked
back into the house, leaving the door open behind him. Gavin turned around at
the two drivers in the van. �Get her in there� he hissed.

&nbsp;

They turned around, and walked back to the van. I panicked,
trying to run somewhere, but they just opened the van and dragged me in front
of Gavin. �Why would I want her?� he said in disgust. �Get her in there. And
what does she smell like?� he asked, wrinkling his nose.

&nbsp;

They started dragging me toward the door when Jason came
out, pulling a garden hose with him.

&nbsp;

�Wow, wow, easy buddy. She's not coming in here looking like
that,� he said. Gavin nodded to the two men holding me, and they dumped me down
slightly away from the house. I looked up and the spray from the hose caught me
right in the stomach, knocking me into a sitting position. 

&nbsp;

I rolled away from the water, but he just kept spraying me;
every part of me was soon numb. When the water stopped, I looked up and saw
Jason walking toward me with the hose. I was relieved that it was over, so I
didn't run. Instead he came up to me, grabbed my wet hair in his hand, and
shoved the front of the hose into my mouth, squeezing the cold water right down
my throat. Just as quickly as he started he stopped, and leaning forward I
started coughing water up on the pavement. 

&nbsp;

Jason then went back into the house, taking the hose with
him. I was shivering uncontrollably now, still coughing up water. I didn't feel
anything when the two men picked me up and carried me into the house. Still
dripping, they dropped me onto a bed and left the room without a word.

&nbsp;

I was exhausted, I had had a long day (or was it a night?).
I lay back on the bed, and drifted off to a deep sleep.

Iniquity: Chapter 3: Part 1

&nbsp;

I shifted to my side on the damp bed, trying to bury my head
under my hands. I could see someone approaching me in the distance; he was
naked and had a huge hard on. For some reason I couldn't run, he walked up to
me grimly and then disappeared, replaced by someone behind me. I could sense
him behind me, but I couldn't turn around. He was so close to me, so close...

&nbsp;

I woke up suddenly, sitting up in bed. I was covered in
sweat; the bed felt uncomfortably damp. I shook my head, trying to erase the
images from my dream. Keeping my eyes closed, I explored my body with my hands.


&nbsp;

My body had the familiar sticky feeling I usually felt in
the morning. My thighs felt tender, and I gently ran my hand up my thigh,
outlining my pussy with my finger. It was slightly swollen; it felt exactly
like what had happened to it. 

&nbsp;

I moved my hand up, accidentally brushing my clit with my
finger. I shivered slightly, enjoying the sensation. My head still felt foggy in
the morning, and I moved my hand back down to my crotch, almost against my
will.

&nbsp;

It felt so good, gently rubbing my clit. Lost in the
sensation, I started slowly fucking myself with my index finger, my thumb still
rubbing against my clit. I moaned softly, fucking myself faster, still with one
finger.

&nbsp;

I rolled onto my belly, sticking my ass into the air, trying
to get into a more comfortable position, with my hand still fucking my pussy.

&nbsp;

I slid another finger in, fucking faster, now loudly
moaning, and just swept up in the feelings. I could feel my secretions dripping
off my hand and onto the bed; but I was beyond caring. I was close... so close,
just a little faster, I thought to myself. 

&nbsp;

The feelings were so strong I didn't notice the door open. I
was just on the point of cumming, a gentle orgasm
beginning to course through me. It came to an abrupt end when I felt myself
falling off the bed, and landing on the ground near the bed, I opened my eyes
for the first time.

&nbsp;

�Jesus, you looked like you were masturbating to save your
life there,� a male voice said from the opposite side of the bed. Looking up,
slightly disoriented, I saw a man with long hair and blue eyes grinning
mischievously. He was holding a leather lead in one hand, following it with my eyes
I saw it disappear behind the bed. 

&nbsp;

�Now get over here,� he motioned, pointing next to him. I
scrambled to my feet, rushing to do what he said. I asked myself as I almost
ran towards him, �why was I listening to him?�

&nbsp;

When I came around the bed, I could see the figure of a
beautiful woman, on her hands and knees, a leash extending from her collar into
the guy�s hand. Looking at the longhaired guy again, I remembered his name from
the day before; someone had called him Jason.

&nbsp;

Jason dropped the leash he was holding and stepped on it
cruelly close to his captive�s neck, forcing her head to come within inches of
the ground in an uncomfortable squatting position. Her black hair fell around
her head, obscuring her face.

&nbsp;

He reached towards me with both hands, pushing down on my
shoulders. I fell onto my knees a little heavily, looking up at him. He seemed
very... in control. Satisfied with my new position, he motioned toward his foot
stepping on the leash.

&nbsp;

�This is Monica,� he said mockingly. �Monica, say hi to
Jess,� he continued looking at her head still inches from the ground. She
mumbled something inaudibly, looking at the ground. 

&nbsp;

He didn't seem to mind her reluctant response, breezily
continuing his little introduction.

&nbsp;

�Say hi to Monica,� he said to me. I whispered a �hi�,
unable to take my eyes off Monica's figure. Jason seemed genuinely amused by
our shy greetings, smiling broadly.

&nbsp;

He bent down and pulled up on the leash, forcing Monica to
her knees, her head high to adjust to his pull on her leash. She initially
pulled her hands up to her neck, but then pulled them behind her back
reluctantly.

&nbsp;

�So, Monica, tell Jess your name,� Jason said playfully,
looking at her. She looked up at me, her eyes red from tears. 

&nbsp;

�I'm slut Monica,� she said in a well-rehearsed voice, and
Jason clapped enthusiastically, relaxing his grip on her leash. She looked down
again, blushing. 

&nbsp;

�It took me about 2 solid days to get her to say that,� he
pointed out for my benefit, petting her on the head. He looked like he was
showing off a new trick that he had just taught his pet; it was grotesque. 

&nbsp;

�So, Jess, want to tell Monica your name?� He asked,
suddenly more serious. I could sense that I was expected to do more than just
say my name; he was listening expectantly.

&nbsp;

�I� I'm slut Jessica...?� I said, hoping I had said the
right words. I clearly had, because he laughed raucously, clapping his hands.
�You're a fast learner,� he said to me. His praise made me feel much better
inside, oddly.

&nbsp;

Still swinging his arms around madly, he suddenly pushed
Monica in the chest. She fell back, her hands behind her, groping for the
ground. In the last second, with a cruel smile on his face, he held the leash
taught as her head was feet from the ground. There was an odd snapping sound, her
head was violently pushed forward, her hands jerking behind her, still looking
for the ground.

&nbsp;

He held her like that, suspended by the neck, for several
seconds, watching her. She was making a strange guttural sound, her face
turning red and her hands jerking behind her slightly. Apparently satisfied,
Jason released the leash and she fell onto her back with a thud.

&nbsp;

I was staring at her; my eyes round with shock. She pulled
her legs up and began massaging her neck. I noticed her shaved slit between her
legs; it had odd red marks around it.

&nbsp;

Jason broke my reverie by walking around me and opening a
door at the foot of the bed I hadn't noticed before. Motioning for me to look
after him, he switched on the lights.

&nbsp;

�There�s a shower in here,� he said, his voice echoing from
inside the bathroom. �Clean yourself up a bit, my brothers showing up today� he
said, still inside the bathroom. �Oh and shave your cunt while you're in here,
there�s a razor on the sink.�

&nbsp;

�You learn a helluva lot faster
than that dumb slut,� he said now out of the room, leaning against the
doorjamb, looking out at Monica.

&nbsp;

When Monica heard her voice she froze, her hands on her
neck. Then she slowly continued massaging her neck, almost hesitantly. This
seemed to infuriate Jason; I saw a muscle twitch in his jaw. 

&nbsp;

He strode over to Monica, and lifted her up with one hand
effortlessly. He pushed her towards the bed; she staggered back and landed with
her back to the bed, leaning against it. When she saw him advancing towards
her, unzipping his fly as he went, she stood up quickly, trying to run away.

&nbsp;

When Jason saw her stand up he reached forward and threw her
back onto the bed, pulling his cock out of his pants. When she saw him standing
between her legs, the fight went out of her. She let her head fall back on the
bed and closed her eyes tightly. 

&nbsp;

He guided his cock into her cunt, slamming it up to the hilt
on one thrust. Monica yelled out in pain, her head rolling from side to side.
Jason showed no mercy; he just shoved himself into her brutally. Monica was
crying loudly now, her head bouncing from side to side with each thrust. 

&nbsp;

Jason had incredibly stamina; he continued for over 5
minutes at the same pace. After some time Monica could no longer scream or cry,
she just gasped each time her body bounced forward, her eyes glazed over
slightly. 

&nbsp;

Slowing down, Jason grunted, and pulled out of her, cumming all over her body. He spurted on her face, breast;
some even landed on the bed. Her head had come to a rest on its side facing me.
I saw some cum land in her eye, but strangely, she didn't blink or move any
more; she must have passed out. Her face transfixed me; her glassy eyes looking
up into her head.

&nbsp;

Jason zipped his pants back on and looked at me viciously.
�What the fuck are you doing here, get into the shower,� he yelled. I turned
around and ran into bathroom, scared of what he might do. �And clean this bitch
up,� he yelled, slamming the door behind him. 

&nbsp;

I got into the shower, still seeing Monica�s rape in my
mind. The shower was surprisingly clean; I had expected a mildew-covered nasty
old tub, it pleasantly surprised me. I washed myself absently; my mind riveted
on Monica.

&nbsp;

I didn't really understand why Jason hated her. She was
physically perfect, her face was cute, even with teary
eyes. Jason's obviously didn't hate her because of her looks; on the other hand
maybe he hated her because she was too... perfect? I wondered if I would be
good enough for him, was he going to abuse me the way he abused Monica?

&nbsp;

I stayed in the shower for a long time, reluctant to get
out. I was scared of what might happen if I left the shower and re-entered the
unpredictable world I had been forced into. Delaying my exit until I felt that
I could find no excuse to stay in any longer, I stepped out, dripping wet,
looking for a towel.

&nbsp;

Remarkably, there was a towel hanging near the shower and I
toweled myself dry. I looked around the relatively bare room; noticing the
razor on the sink. I remembered Jason telling me to shave myself, so I
reluctantly took the razor and sat down on the floor, reaching for the shaving
cream. 

&nbsp;

I felt silly, reaching between my legs again and again. I
kept looking up towards the door, hoping no one would walk in on me doing this.
I hurriedly finished and touched my now smooth slit. The sensation was
different, more intense. I remembered the embarrassing start to the day, when
Jason had walked in on me masturbating. I slid a finger into my pussy,
shuddering slightly.

&nbsp;

I quickly pulled out again, this wasn't right. Standing up,
I walked out of the bathroom. Monica was no longer on the bed, but I didn't
have to look far to see her. 

&nbsp;

She was slumped on the ground, her head at an uncomfortable
angle, resting against the side of the bed. I walked toward her, very conscious
of my nakedness. I bent down next to her; she turned away to avoid looking at
me. I could still see cum splattered over her body, she had clearly made no
effort to wipe it off. Reaching over, I wiped some cum out of her face.

&nbsp;

�Go away,� she said in a shaky voice, vaguely blocking my
hand and turning away. I didn't want to leave her alone; she seemed hurt and
sad. I stayed near her, watching her.

&nbsp;

�Just leave me alone,� she said again, and unsteadily got to
her feet. She limped into the bathroom; the sound of water breaking the awkward
silence. She was obviously cleaning herself, I felt relieved that I wouldn't
have to force her to.

&nbsp;

I looked around the bare room; the only real piece of
furniture was the large bed. Looking at it closely, I noticed a small glob of
cum on it. Partly out of curiosity, and partly because Jason probably wouldn't
like it if I didn't clean up, I scooped it up on my finger. I nervously looked
towards the bathroom, I could still hear the sound of
running water.

&nbsp;

Very slowly, I dipped my cum-covered finger towards my
mouth, and touched it, just barely, to my tongue. It was salty at first, but
then a nasty taste filled my mouth. I spit, more to register disgust than to
really expel my saliva. Looking up suddenly, I noticed Monica standing in the doorway,
looking at me.

&nbsp;

I blushed; she had obviously seen me lick the
cum. What would she think of me, I worried. She
turned her head away from me and ignored me, walking toward the opposite side
of the room.

&nbsp;

I hurriedly walked to the sink, cleaning my hand under the
running water. I was still a bit shaken, I had never intended to be seen trying
the cum. Why had I even tried, it I wondered. It was
nasty; Monica now thought I was some sluty bimbo.

&nbsp;

I walked out of the room and spotted Monica in the corner of
the room, her knees drawn up to her chest. She had her hands folded on her
knees, her head resting on her forearms. I walked towards her; it didn't seem
right for me to ignore her, we were in this together after all.

&nbsp;

Sitting against the wall next to her, I leaned back and
looked around the room, suddenly fascinated by the ceiling. The silence could
not have been heavier. I must have opened my mouth at least 3 times to say
something, only to stop myself in the last second.

&nbsp;

�How did you get here?� Monica asked. I was relieved that
she had broken the silence, but unsure of what to say. How did
I get here, I asked myself.

&nbsp;

�I, um, I...� What could I say? That I had been dragged of
the street, after some stupid idea I hadn't even liked in the first place? I
was relieved to hear Monica talking again; she sounded like she needed someone
to talk to, so I listened.

&nbsp;

�I used to be a 'security consultant' for some dickhead
named Gavin,� she said tonelessly. �We were supposed to 'protect' something,
but all we did was bully people around.� She took a deep breath and continued,� �there was this one
guy; he just broke down in front of us, crying. We had threatened to kill his
wife and only daughter unless he cooperated with us...�

&nbsp;

She stopped, swallowed, and continued, �After that, I
complained to Gavin. Threatened him, made a scene. Said it was illegal, said
I'd turn him in to the cops. He just listened quietly, and the next day some of
his goons picked me up and threw me in here...� she stopped, looking at me for
the first time.

&nbsp;

�I... you did the right thing?� I offered hopefully. 

&nbsp;

�Great, look where it got me,� she responded, tugging at her
leash miserably. I could tell she really hated this, that she would do anything
to get out of here.

&nbsp;

�Look, its not so bad... is it?� I said, trying to make her
feel better. She looked back, her face suddenly angry.

&nbsp;

�Yeah, its great for a slut like
you. Bet you can't get enough of Jason's cock, can you.� She retorted, and
suddenly got up, walking into the bathroom. That was unfair, I thought, I
hadn't meant it to sound that way. I was only trying to make her feel better...

&nbsp;

The door opened again and Jason came in, another man walking
in with him. The other guy looked remarkably like Jason, only he didn't have
long hair or the goatee. The most disturbing thing about his appearance were his small blue eyes. He looked at me briefly, making me
shudder; I was relieved when he broke his gaze to take a drink out of his beer.

&nbsp;

Jason looked at me, then looked
around the rest of the room, looking for Monica. Shaking his head, he went into
the bathroom, coming out a second later holding a yelping Monica by the leash.
Jason was as angry as ever, throwing her on to the ground, cursing. 

&nbsp;

I wasn't sure what to do, still sitting against the far wall.

&nbsp;

�Jess, Monica, meet Jim,� Jason said with an exaggerated
wave. He was sitting on the edge of the bed, his boot pressing down on the side
of Monica's face, forcing her onto the ground. Jim ignored him, staring at me.

&nbsp;

�So, how�s it going over at your place,� Jason asked his
brother, poking Monica's prone body with his other foot.

&nbsp;

�Heh, I've been having a lot of
fun with one of mine,� he said slowly, drunkenly. �Some idiot said hooking her
up to anti-psychotics was fun -�



�You what!� responded Jason, laughing hard. He clearly
pressed down too hard on Monica's head, making her scream. He ignored her.
�What the fuck are you messing around with anti-psychotics for?�

&nbsp;

�I told you, this shrink said-�

&nbsp;

�You're seeing a shrink now?� Jason asked again, laughing loudly.
He pushed Monica onto her back with his other foot, her head still pinned under
his foot. �You really need it badly, I can tell.�

&nbsp;

�Shut up, asshole. I'm not seeing a
shrink; I hired one of Gavin's morons to screw around with her. It's supposed
to have a funny effect,� he added, as if defending his idea.

&nbsp;

�Real clever, real clever,� Jason said. He shifted his
weight on the bed, now forcing one of his feet into Monica's mouth, the other
pressing down on her chest. �Why do you always do this screwball shit to your
chicks; didn't you sterilize one of them?� 

&nbsp;

Jim laughed a little. �That was a special case. You see, I
couldn't figure out if she was bi or not, so I just settled the question once
and for all and made her neutral. It was a really good idea,� he said again,
drinking from his beer.

&nbsp;

�Wow, ok, ok, too much information. So what are you doing
with her now?� he asked again, absent-mindedly molesting Monica with his feet.

&nbsp;

�Gavin's little friend said he wanted to try out some new
method of torture on her,� he answered happily. �It's like called 'self-', uh,
'self-something'� he finished lamely.

&nbsp;

�Mmhmm... Great idea, as usual,�
said Jason looking around the room vaguely. �Why aren't you watching it, isn't
that what you usually do?�

&nbsp;

�C'mon, I wanted to see your new ones. Mine never last long
anyway,� he said, laughing a little.

&nbsp;

�Man, you're really weirded out.�
He now had one leg on Monica's neck, the other poking her crotch. There was a
kind of nasty silence, punctured by the sound of Jason stepping on Monica.

&nbsp;

�I broke her nose, too,� said Jim finally, breaking the
silence.

&nbsp;

�...What?� said Jason sharply, looking up surprised. �Just
when I thought you could get no weirder...�

&nbsp;

�Let me show you,� said Jim, walking towards Monica. He
walked towards Monica, fishing something out of his pocket.

&nbsp;

�Hey, hey, don't break her nose,� said Jason, for the first
time a little concerned. 

&nbsp;

�I'm not going to break her nose,� said Jim, distracted with
something in his hand. He took her arm, holding it up to his face. Monica
couldn't see what he was doing; her face still covered by Jason's foot. Jim was
concentrating, holding something up to Monica's wrist.

&nbsp;

Monica suddenly screamed, thrashing violently under Jason's
foot. Jason looked down, watching her squirming under him. He seemed to debate
within himself, then let her go; she looked like she
would hurt herself if he kept her down any longer. 

&nbsp;

She crawled off quickly, holding her wrist in her hand.
Blood was pouring down, out of her wrist, covering her hand and spilling onto
the floor. I was staring at her, my eyes wide with shock. I wasn't the only
one; Jason was also looking at her, the same shocked look on his face.

&nbsp;

�What... dude, what the fuck did you do to her?� asked
Jason, looking between Jim and Monica, now sobbing hysterically onto the floor.
Her hand was covered in blood now; there was a pool of it on the ground. She
looked like she was dying or something; it was awful.

&nbsp;

Everyone just stared at Monica's bleeding hand for a few
minutes. Monica was desperately holding her hand over her wound, trying to stop
the blood.

&nbsp;

Jim was looking at her, laughing to himself quietly. He
pulled a rag out of his pocket and advanced towards Monica again. She didn't
see him until he grabbed her bloody hand, then she pulled away, desperately
trying to get herself free of him.

&nbsp;

Uncharacteristically, Jim held her hand steady, displaying
no real effort in holding her hand straight. He took his rag, and wiped away
all the blood from the area right where he had cut her wrist. Finished, he held
it up for Jason to see.

&nbsp;

There was a nasty looking red mark, extending horizontally
across her wrist. Oddly enough, there was no blood coming from it. He even
squeezed it with his hand, causing Monica to start whining in pain; still, no
blood came out of it.

&nbsp;

�How the hell did it stop bleeding,� asked Jason, still
confused. �I thought something like that bleeded out
on you... isn't it like the most popular way to kill yourself?�

&nbsp;

Jim was smiling smugly, dumping Monica's hand down and
walking back towards his former spot. �When you cut the vein like that, it
bleeds like crazy for a couple seconds, then stops on
its own. The vein sinks into the hand; stops bleeding.� He was drinking from
his beer again, relaxed.

&nbsp;

�So... how do you kill yourself by cutting your wrist
then... if it stops bleeding?� asked Jason, really interested in his discussion
with Jim, ignoring Monica. She was staring at her wrist, blindly, no longer
sobbing loudly, tears still flowing out of her eyes.

&nbsp;

�You don't. Cutting your wrist is the dumbest way to kill
yourself because you freaking can't,� answered Jim, laughing a little. �Here,
watch this again.� He walked toward Monica again, and taking her other hand,
dragged her towards Jason.

&nbsp;

�Watch,� he took his bloody knife out and slowly began
drawing it across her other wrist. Monica was struggling violently; she seemed
crazed with pain and fear. The knife was making a nasty squishy sound as it
opened her wrist.

&nbsp;

Blood immediately began pouring down her other hand and
Monica gave up; just sitting on the ground, her bleeding hand watched by the
two brothers. They stared at it intelligently for a few seconds, then burst out laughing.

&nbsp;

�How the hell are you supposed to see it stop bleeding,�
asked Jason, throwing her hand down. �There�s enough blood to keep a whole
family of vampires happy.�

&nbsp;

Jim was giggling like a little kid, wiping his bloody hands
on the rag he used to wipe Monica's other hand. They continued talking, but I
wasn't listening anymore. It was sick; what they had done to Monica. She slowly
crawled back against the wall, her eyes wide and staring, no longer capable of
crying.

&nbsp;

I wanted to cry for her, she looked so... hurt. I gasped
suddenly; her body looked different, she was facing the ground; it looked like
she had something in her mouth. A second later she threw up on the ground, her
face pale and facing down, swaying slightly. 

&nbsp;

Jason looked up, he saw Monica facing the ground, some spit
still coming out of mouth. He had real concern in his eyes now; he was staring at
her pale face strangely.

&nbsp;

Jim noticed Jason wasn't listening to him anymore, so he got
up, leaving his empty beer bottle on the ground. Walking towards the door, he
whistled loudly, and walked out.

&nbsp;

Jason walked towards Monica, gently lifting her by her left
hand. Monica, as soon as she felt him pull up, immediately shot to her feet,
her right hand clutching her collar. No doubt she was used to getting yanked up
by the collar.

&nbsp;

He gently led her forward, by the hand. She let him lead her
for a few steps; then her knees buckled and she fell forward screaming. Jason
looked confused, still holding her by the wrist. She tried to stand up again,
the wrist held by Jason bent at an unnatural angle, she was clearly struggling
to take the pressure off her wrist. 

&nbsp;

Once Jason figured out what was wrong, he dropped her wrist.
Monica fell on her side, holding her left wrist in her other hand, keeping it
bent, whimpering slightly. Jason looked at her, a little annoyed now.

&nbsp;

�It's not broken,� he pointed out, bending down and
straightening her wrist. She let out a little scream again as her wrist was
extended fully, pushing herself away from Jason. He looked even more annoyed;
he didn't seem to be able to spend 10 seconds without hurting her accidentally.

&nbsp;

Suddenly reaching down, he picked her up and gently laid her
out on the bed. She just lay still on her back, not moving. Jason watched her
for a second, then walked towards me briskly. I breathed quickly, filled with
dread, anticipating at what he would do to me.

&nbsp;

He roughly pulled me up by my collar, almost yanking my head
off. I could understand Monica's quick reaction when he had taken her by the
hand; I could barely breathe with the way he was holding my collar.

&nbsp;

Guiding me towards the foot of the bed, he forced me into a
kneeling position, my head inches from Monica's shaved slit. 



�Do a good job,� he hissed at me, and pushed my head forward
slightly. I panicked for a second; this was too nasty. I had never done
something like this before; I was not bisexual. I felt a sting on my ass, Jason
slapped me viciously, telling me to get started.

&nbsp;

I moved my head closer, poking my tongue out experimentally,
probing her. The smell was overpowering; the taste on my tongue was nasty. I
gently slid my tongue over her cunt once, then pulled back, looking back up at
Jason questioningly.

&nbsp;

He looked back at me angrily. Grabbing my hair with one
hand, he literally shoved my head onto her cunt, rubbing my face against it.
Monica moaned loudly, her breathing coming out in small gasps now. Jason kept
shoving my head against her; not noticing that Monica's head suddenly fell to
its side, no longer moving.

&nbsp;

He looked up, letting go of my hair. Seeing Monica's head on
its side, he rushed up to her and picked up her head with his hands, gently.
She was breathing slower now, her eyes closed. She had obviously passed out.

&nbsp;

I backed away from her slowly, unsure of how Jason would
react. He dropped her head back, ignoring it bounce and come to a rest on its
side. He advanced towards me angrily, his face a mask of fury.

&nbsp;

He backhanded me in the face, breaking the skin on my lip,
throwing me onto my back. I screamed out, but he didn't care at all, slapping
me in the face violently, venting his frustration on me. A few seconds later he
let go of me, pacing around the room angrily.

&nbsp;

Noticing Jim's empty beer on the ground brought back his
anger in a flash; seizing it with one hand he brought it crashing down on my
head; the glass falling to pieces around my head.

&nbsp;

His angry face froze in my mind as I slowly collapsed
backwards, everything painfully fading away.



&nbsp;



&nbsp;

Iniquity: Chapter 3: Part 2

&nbsp;

I woke up quickly, opening my eyes. I shut them just as
fast; there was a bright light focused directly on my face. That was stupid,
what kind of idiot would point a lamp at my head, I thought.

&nbsp;

Keeping my eyes closed this time, I tried to sit up, but
couldn't. Not good. I tried to move my head; even that wouldn't budge. Moving
my hands and feet had as much of an effect. Absolutely none.

&nbsp;

Ok, I thought to myself, don't panic. I tried to lift my
head slowly, this time I felt some band around my forehead, holding it in
place. At least I wasn't paralyzed, I thought glumly.

&nbsp;

With nothing else to do but lie still on the gurney, I
thought back to what had happened before. Jim reading his little speech, the
guy raping me, the injection... oh shit, the injection. I hyperventilated,
suddenly convinced I had become stupid. The freaking anti-psychotic was making
me retarded I thought, convinced that I was no longer intelligent.

&nbsp;

I shuddered slightly; I suddenly acted the way I thought an
anti-psychotic would act on me. My legs started shaking, my hands were
vibrating, on their own now. The gurney I was on swayed a little.

&nbsp;

The light over my head suddenly went off and I opened my eyes.
I saw a plastic bag with clear liquid in it, a tube coming out of it, going
into my hand. Even more disturbing was the creepy guy looking down at me; all I
could see were his eyes.

&nbsp;

�You need to calm down, Kate. Take a deep breath, relax,� he
said slowly, calmly. By now I couldn't; my hands almost had a life of their
own, shaking. He didn't seem to mind, disappearing from my limited view for a
second. 

&nbsp;

He returned as quickly as he had disappeared, holding a
needle to the base of my neck. Pushing down on it, I felt a sharp pain as he
injected me with something. Seconds later, I felt my hands relax, no longer
twitching. It was like a pendulum, swinging down, but over swinging on the
other side. I could no longer move any part of my body, my mind felt sluggish
and more than a little numb.

&nbsp;

�I'm here to help you, Kate. I'm here to help you help
yourself,� he continued. 

&nbsp;

�Help me with what,� I said, my voice drawling stupidly. I
could barely move my tongue.

&nbsp;

�Why do you think you're here?� he asked, ignoring my
answer.

&nbsp;

�The little whats-his-face... Gav-� I started to say, but he talked right over me.

&nbsp;

�No. You're here because of you, and you alone. You brought
yourself here. You disrespected Jim, You tried to kill Kelly, YOU tried to fix
the case!� His voice rose at the end, like he was working himself into a fury.

&nbsp;

�I didn't... no...� I answered vaguely. I had done all those
things, but...

&nbsp;

�Like I said, I'm here to help you,� he said again, the
calmness back in his voice. He brushed my face with a peculiar smelling dry
wipe; I closed my eyes as he moved his hand over my face. I couldn't do
anything to stop him, strapped to the gurney and barely able to move.

&nbsp;

�This will help you understand,� he said again, and pushed a
plastic tube between my teeth. The next second my body exploded in pain, I bit
down on the plastic tube in my mouth, my teeth hurting as I pushed down hard.

&nbsp;


�Try to breathe, slowly,� he said over the ringing in my ears. The pain was
intense; I closed my eyes, my head shaking slowly. The tube in my mouth was
hollow, my breath coming out of it with a whistling sound. My hands were
clenched into fists, also shaking slightly.

&nbsp;

This continued for far longer than I imagined possible, the
ringing in my ears reaching new heights, my mind totally blank. After what
seemed like hours, but in reality was only several minutes, the pain stopped
and I fell back against the gurney, utterly exhausted.

&nbsp;

I spit out the little plastic mouth guard, my mind still
reeling from the pain. I wouldn't open my eyes, my brain was barely
functioning. Everything seemed to be rushing at me, the ringing in my ears
continuing well after the pain stopped.

&nbsp;

�You made the wrong choices. You got yourself here. You need
to admit your problem.� The clear voice said again. I could feel someone
hovering over me, but I didn't open my eyes. I shook my head a little; how
could this be my fault?

&nbsp;

�I'm only trying to help,� he said again, putting the mouth
guard back into my mouth. Smiling to himself, he pushed a button I could just
barely see from where I was lying, and the pain hit me again.

&nbsp;

I instantly closed my eyes
and bit down on the mouth guard. I was making a monotone moaning sound, in
addition to the harsh whistle coming from the end of the gag. Stop, I pleaded
silently. Stop this, I can't take it any more...

&nbsp;

As if in answer to my thoughts, the pain stopped and I
opened my eyes quickly. He was still sitting exactly where he had been before,
still smiling. I looked up at him, pleading with my eyes. I hated this helpless
feeling, knowing he could make me suffer with a touch of his finger, on a whim.

&nbsp;

�Don't think I'm the one calling the shots here,� he said.
He seemed to know what I was thinking, answering my thoughts. �If it hadn't
been for you, you wouldn't even be here. Do you realize that now? Do you see
that your idiocy is what brought you here?� He was looking at me intently, his
face unreadable, but clearly enjoying himself. 

&nbsp;

�Well, too bad. I thought you would have learned your lesson
by now.� Looking down, almost as if regretting what he was about to do, he
pushed the button.

&nbsp;

I anticipated the pain this
time, but that didn't make it any better. The same howling in my ears, the same
struggle to breathe; I couldn't get used to it. I'll do anything for you, I
thought to myself. Anything, just stop this, don't hurt me...

&nbsp;

�I know you would probably do anything for me now,� his
voice filling my ears as soon as the pain stopped, again. �And, although that
isn't really the point, you can do something for me.�

&nbsp;

I was hanging on to every word, hoping for some small amount
of pity; when he said I could do something for him, I was suddenly filled with
dread, instead of happiness. I had no doubt that whatever he wanted me to do
would be no better than what he was doing to me now. He stood up, leaving my
limited range of vision. All I could see was the button, the little black
button that had caused me all this pain, and it didn't even look menacing.

&nbsp;

I felt something between my legs, and then his voice floated
towards me, sounding slightly different from this angle. �I want you to piss
now, let everything out.� 

&nbsp;

With no second thoughts, I did exactly as I was told. I let
it all out, just like he told me to. It was humiliating, knowing he was
watching something I would only do in private; but also because I had so
willingly followed his orders. Some small part of me thought this was
disgusting, vile. I only had to look back at the button to remind myself why I
was doing this.

&nbsp;

The flow trickled to a drip, then stopped altogether. He
wiped my pussy, making me blush in shame. His head came back into my view, but
I averted my eyes. I couldn't look at him, it was too degrading. 

&nbsp;

�As I said, that was a little side-show,� he said again, his
chair creaking as he made himself comfortable. �And I'm not convinced that you
really believe this is all your fault.� As he said that I almost cried,
preparing myself for the pain again.

&nbsp;

�But, since I think you need some more convincing, I think
you should push the button,� he said, getting up and taking the little remote
off the table, sliding it under my hand. I pulled my fingers back as far as the
restraint would allow, I didn't want to accidentally touch it. 

&nbsp;

I could see his logic; either I pushed it, showing him that
I really thought this was my entire fault, or, I didn't push it, and he assumed
I wasn't convinced yet. It was a lose-lose situation, I couldn't get myself out
of this. I had to push the button, I told myself. It was the better of the two
options; at least he would think I had learned my lesson. 

&nbsp;

I started crying, unable to hit the button. I had to do it,
everything will be better if I do. And yet, I... couldn't. My hand refused to
move down, refused to go anywhere near the little button. I didn't want to push
the button, but I had to, I had to...

&nbsp;

�Mmm, you obviously don't think
this is your fault... you want to blame someone else, maybe blame me?� His
voice echoed oddly as he walked closer towards me. I could now see him standing
over me, his hands covered by latex gloves. Looking down on me, he stretched
his hand out, caressing my face with an amused expression. �How sad, you're
crying now,� his voice betraying no pity. He brushed my nose lightly, his hands
roaming over my face. �Oh look, someone broke your nose,� he said laughing
slightly. �Let me guess, that was all the evil boogeyman's fault too, wasn't
it?� It was, I thought to myself, that had been none of my fault...

&nbsp;

He suddenly reached down and grabbed a nipple in each hand,
pulling on them sharply. He caught me completely by surprise; I bit down on the
mouth guard in shock, my hand making a fist purely reflexively. As my fingers
closed, I brushed the button with my hand. I panicked completely now, my hand
was pressing the button down, but I didn't feel any different. 

&nbsp;

�I forgot to tell you, it activates when you release the
button -� he said, too late. I had already jerked my hand up, the pain now
overwhelming me. I surrendered myself completely to the pain, no longer
fighting it. It was all my fault; I had put myself in this place, I had screwed
up. It was all my fault. 

&nbsp;

As I wallowed in self pity, I felt my mind burrow into
itself, like I was withdrawing deep into my head, hiding inside a shell I had
created. I was watching myself now, like I was no longer a part of my body. As
I imagined what I must look like, lying on the gurney, desperately breathing
through the little tube stuck between my teeth, I felt my mind wander...

~*~

&nbsp;

I drifted to the time
when I was 19, still in college. Everything had been so easy back then, even
though at the time I thought it could not have been worse. It was May, the week
before our finals. Everyone was studying hard, trying desperately to make up
for all times they had skipped class. 

&nbsp;

It was past 3 in the
morning; I was sleeping with my head against the table. We had been studying
here all night, and by now everyone had either left, or fallen asleep. 

&nbsp;

I lifted my head off
the table, staring bleakly around the room. Max, my then boyfriend, was
sleeping next to me. We were in a rather mild teenage relationship, only
together for the school year.

&nbsp;

He grunted and woke
up, looking at me through half-closed eyes. 

&nbsp;

�Hey Kate...� he said
sleepily, pushing his chair away from the table and leaning back.

&nbsp;

I smiled, pushing away
the psyche textbook I had been sleeping on. �You ready for this final?� I
asked, sitting up and smoothing my shirt.

&nbsp;

�What? ...Oh, yea,
definitely,� he said, looking at me a little strangely. I laughed; he had never
been serious about his classes. �My pen, where�s my pen?� he asked suddenly,
looking around. 

&nbsp;

He had this stupid
little plastic pen with a chewed out cap. He was obsessed with either twirling
it in his fingers, usually dropping it. Even though he must have dropped it
everywhere, he still chewed on it. It was nasty, but he would go absolutely
nuts if he didn't have his pen. 

&nbsp;

Standing up, he looked
around the room, fully awake and concerned. To him, there was nothing more
important than his pen. I looked around and noticed the pen at the base of my
chair, on the opposite side from where he was sitting. 

&nbsp;

�It's here, next to my
chair,� I called out, still sleepy. �I'm not touching it; you get it yourself
if you want it,� I added, and leaned back in my chair.

&nbsp;

He laughed a little,
then got up slowly, walking towards my chair. Looking over my chair, he saw it
lying on the floor on the other side of me.

&nbsp;

�C'mon, get the pen
for me,� he said lazily. I giggled, still leaning back in my chair. 

&nbsp;

Shaking his head, he
reached over me, trying to get his pen. He overbalanced, and fell onto my knees,
still groping for the pen. I laughed, watching him squirming over my knees. 

&nbsp;

Finally getting his
pen, he stuffed it in his pocket and then just lay there, sprawled over my lap.
I laughed a little, pushing him off.

&nbsp;

Straightening up, he
pulled a leg over to the other side, now straddling my lap, looking at me. This
was a little less funny, I was starting to feel that it had gone too far, but I
didn't say anything, I just looked up at him, a little scared for the first
time.

&nbsp;

�Max, stop this is-�
he cut me off with a kiss, forcing his tongue into my mouth. I pushed against
him a little weakly, not sure what to do.

&nbsp;

He continued his wet
kiss, breathing harder now. I returned the kiss, a little, hoping he would
leave things at that. As soon as he felt me returning the kiss, he went
completely off his handle, his arms groping me all over.

&nbsp;

A single tear rolled
down my cheek as he continued groping me, his mouth still clamped over mine.
His hands inevitably found their way to the top of my skirt; pulling away all
the material covering my crotch.

&nbsp;

Unzipping his fly, now
no longer kissing me, he guided the head of his cock against me, pushing in
slowly. His mouth was right next to mine, breathing heavily, his eyes staring
off to the side.

&nbsp;

It only lasted a few
seconds; he came soon after he started. When he finished, he fell asleep over
me, his cock still inside me.

&nbsp;

I waited for several
seconds, scared that he might suddenly wake up. After some time I could hear
him snoring, his body still slumped over me. Slowly, carefully, I began to
slide out from under him, hoping he wouldn't wake up.

&nbsp;

I made it out; leaving
him slumped over the chair I was in. Hurriedly pulling my skirt up, I ran out
of the room and into my dorm, crying harder now.

&nbsp;

After that night I
wouldn't talk to him anymore; I would ignore him when he tried to talk to me.
He stopped trying soon, and I stopped seeing him after he apparently gave up. 

&nbsp;

A month later he
overdosed on heroin...

&nbsp;

~*~

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

...Things slowly came back in focus as I woke up, looking
around. The room was dark now and I couldn't see anything. My head was on its
side; someone must have released the strap on my forehead. I remembered the
dream I had, remembering Max.

&nbsp;

�I love you, Max,� I whispered out loud. �Please come back.�
He wouldn't come back; he couldn't. After he OD'ed,
he fell into a coma for several weeks. 

&nbsp;

When he woke up he was mentally retarded, unable to do
anything on his own. I visited him, once, in the hospital. It was horrible; he
couldn't recognize me, he couldn't talk. He just sat in his wheelchair, staring
at the wall stupidly. He ignored me completely, even when I sat directly in
front of him, trying to look at his face. I left less than a minute later,
horrified by what I had seen.

&nbsp;

The door opened loudly, upsetting my thoughts as light
streamed in. I tried to think back to where I was, what I was doing here; my
brain felt like a snow globe, my thoughts still settling down after someone
shook it. 

&nbsp;

Someone walked next to me and without a word began to remove
all the straps holding me down on the gurney. Still a little confused, I
thought it was Max coming to save me. Even as I thought it was him, I realized
the stupidity of what I was thinking. For starters, this guy was black.

&nbsp;

As he unbuckled the last of the straps, I tried moving my
hand slowly. It felt stiff, really difficult to move. I could almost feel my
joints creaking like rusty machinery. 

&nbsp;

He picked me up and set me down on my feet, still supporting
me. I gasped as the blood began to flow through my legs again. Why did it have
to hurt, I thought, why couldn't something be easy for once. I didn't even feel
like I was standing, I just felt a muted pain as I put my weight on my legs. 

&nbsp;

Realizing that I couldn't walk anytime soon, the guard
picked me up again, and walked out the door. I was still trying to settle my
mind, put myself back together. A short while later the guard put me back down
in front of a familiar door, opened it, and walked me in.

&nbsp;

Kelly was sitting in the same corner she usually sat in, the
same dumb deer-in-the-headlights look. Setting me down, the guard went back to
the door and slammed it without a backward glance. 

&nbsp;

I could vaguely remember feeling angry with Kelly for
something, but I felt nothing but curiosity towards her now. She was looking at
me wearily, she obviously hadn't forgotten the time I tried to choke her. I
figured that if I wanted her to tell me anything, I would have to apologize to
her first.

&nbsp;

�Hi,� I began in a friendly voice. I did want to scare her
anymore than she already was.

&nbsp;

�W-What?� Her head whipped around, looking at me with round
eyes. 

&nbsp;

�Look, Kelly, I'm sorry,� I said, trying to smile.

&nbsp;

�It's ok,� she mumbled, looking down again.

&nbsp;

Silence pervaded for a couple minutes, both of us a little
embarrassed. 

&nbsp;

�How did you... get here?� asked Kelly quietly, looking at
me earnestly. I was no small amount surprised to hear her break the silence.

&nbsp;

�It was my fault, I made some bad choices. I� well, yeah it
was my fault� I responded without hesitation, barely thinking about her
question. �How did you get here?� 

&nbsp;

Kelly just stared at me strangely for a few seconds, her old
dumb expression back. 

&nbsp;

�What did they do to you?� she asked suddenly, still
watching me. 

&nbsp;

I thought back to the little office, Jim ranting about something...
I couldn't remember what he had said. Then, nothing... only something to do
with Max, oddly enough. I looked back at Kelly, she didn't seem to expect a
reply. 

&nbsp;

�I'm fine,� I assured her warmly, not dwelling on the
unpleasant memories.

&nbsp;

Kelly just continued to stare at me as we sat in an
uncomfortable

Iniquity: Chapter 4

&nbsp;

NOTE: this is entirely fictional, none of the characters in the book are real in
any way. Any correlation to fact is entirely coincidental. No real person is
portrayed in this story.

&nbsp;



&nbsp;

Sean sat in his office on the 22nd floor. He could see cars
as small as ants slowly moving along the road. People could hardly be seen at
this height. Someone out there was his source, he mused, and someone from all
those millions of morons walking around could give him the fame and wealth he
wished for�

�

Stop, he told himself. There�s no point just daydreaming. I
have to finish this fucking report, get it past the editor� This is all so
stupid. He looked at the article he was busy typing on the screen. �Mayor
announces legislation to toughen penalties for driving without a seatbelt�.
Bullshit.

�

He stealthily reached into his pocket and took out a
key-chain jump drive. He had it all stored here, on this little plastic toy.
The article he was still �investigating�.�
He had it backed up at home, of course, but he liked to carry it around
with him. All he needed was for this guy to call him, give him some more dirt
on that big trial, and he was set for life�

�

The phone rang, interrupting his reverie. He sat up and
picked up the phone, putting the jump drive back into his pocket.

�

�Someone gave us a note, says he wants to meet with you
outside,� said the receptionist in a bored voice. The source!

�

�I�ll be right there,� he said, slamming down the phone. He
could barely contain his excitement. This was it! He could finally meet the guy
sending him these anonymous tips on how the trial was all faked, by both sides,
etc. He adjusted the hidden mic, composed himself in the mirror, and walked
into the elevator.

�

Once on the lobby, he walked outside. There was the usual
collection of people walking around, talking, cars honking. Where was that
freaking source?

�

He walked around aimlessly for a few minutes, his hopes
dwindling. The fucking secretary probably had a 2-hour break
before she delivered the message to him. So close�!

�

His phone vibrated and he almost jumped with surprise. Why
am I so jumpy, he wondered, and answered the phone.

�

�Corner of Park St.�
Came a voice as soon as he answered the phone.

�

�Wait, wait, who are you�?� There was a click and the line
went dead. This had to be his source. Who else?

�

Park Street
was just around the corner, in one of the more secluded streets. He had
expected a public place for the meeting, but its not
like he had a choice.

�

Walking down the small streets, the number of people
dwindled down to almost nothing. The strange buildings everywhere muffled the
sound of the cars. Park Street
was just ahead�

�

Someone from behind pushed him hard, and he crashed sideways
into a row of trashcans, trying to regain his balance. Before he even came to a
rest, the guy picked him up and punched him in the stomach, holding him by the
back of his shirt. A passerby dropped her bag of groceries and ran, covering
her mouth.

�

�Listen up, Sean,� he whispered in his ear. �This is over.
Go back, forget the source. There is no source, never was.�

�

Sean gasped for breath and tried to stay calm. Yeah, stay
calm when some freak is about to beat the crap out of him. He could only see
that he was dressed in a black hood that came over his eyes, obscuring his
face.

�

Still holding Sean by the neck, the hooded man began
searching Sean, his hands delving into his pockets. He felt the jump drive and
slowly pulled it out, holding it up for Sean to see.

�

�You won�t need this,� he hissed, pocketing the device. A
siren could be heard in the distance. �Good bye, Sean. Remember what I told
you.� With that he reached back with his forearm and brought it as hard as he
could into Sean�s face. Sean slumped to the ground unconscious. The hooded man
walked into one of the buildings and disappeared.

�



A moment later several cops
appeared, guns drawn. Too late.

&nbsp;



&nbsp;

There was nothing to do. Absolutely
nothing. Kelly was pointedly ignoring me, and there was� nothing else to
interact with. Initially afraid of me, she had shifted her attitude towards
indifference. A change for the worse, I mused. 

&nbsp;

Looking across, I could see her �snoozing� in the corner. As
usual, she wasn�t actually sleeping, just leaning against the wall with her
eyes closed. She didn�t seem to mind me staring at her either, as if to
maintain the illusion that she couldn�t tell; that she was actually asleep.
That alone irritated me. 

&nbsp;

As my mind wandered, my eyes rested on her again. There was
nothing else to watch, besides the ever-exciting gray wall, of course. She was
blond, her hair probably shoulder length. A rather small
face, nothing remarkable. I even noticed a reddish hole in her ear, no doubt she had some kind of earring in it at some
point. Her position didn�t give me the best view of her ear lobe, and I
couldn�t tell how many earrings she might have had. Looking down her body, she
had C-cup tits, which she somehow never bothered to cover either. A slim waist,
from what I could see, and some long carefully shaved legs completed her. I
felt silly thinking about how many earrings she might have had, checking her
out like a lesbian; there just wasn�t much else to do. 

&nbsp;

The vent in the ceiling droned on, circulating stagnant air.
It never changed, in all the hours I spent here. I could remember it smelling
unpleasant when I first got thrown in here. Over time I could no longer
distinguish the smell. 

&nbsp;

Time dragged on�

&nbsp;

A slight movement from Kelly caught my eye. She happed
opened her eyes suddenly, staring to my right. This didn�t normally happen with
Kelly, in fact the only time she moved suddenly was
when someone like Jim came by. I dearly hoped something was finally going to happen. 

&nbsp;

Kelly stared at the door intently. I wanted to poke fun at
her for staring at the clearly non-moving mover; about a dozen witty remarks
sprang to my mind. Only I didn�t say anything. I don�t even really know why I
didn�t; something about me had changed since the time I came here. Whatever, I
thought, and looked at the door with her. Fun.

&nbsp;

About a minute later, I was starting to feel like a moron.
Was this Kelly�s idea of fun? Stare at the door and watch my reaction? I wasn�t
going to admit defeat just yet, I thought. I continued to stare at the door for
awhile, and then, very faintly, heard some footsteps outside the door.

&nbsp;

Wow. That was pretty impressive, if she actually heard that
noise about a minute ago. Or she might have just gotten lucky. She didn�t seem
like the brightest bulb to me, but looks can be deceiving. I mean why shouldn�t
they be deceiving? I could imagine what I looked like, sitting against the
wall, naked, with a broken nose. 

&nbsp;

The noise increased in volume, as whoever was walking came
closer. More like shuffling, actually, it wasn�t a clearly defined step. More of a sliding noise. I could only imagine the let down
if the person didn�t come in here. In fact, that was unimaginable. It wouldn�t
happen, I convinced myself. Who can resist coming into an unmarked gray door? 

&nbsp;

I literally jumped when I heard the door bounce slightly.
Someone was fiddling with the doorknob on the other side. Maybe it wouldn�t be
so good if whoever it was actually came in. From my limited experience, it
never boded well when someone came here. As the door just kind of shook for
some seconds, I became more and more scared. What if�?

&nbsp;

Looking over at Kelly, I could see that she was scared too.
She was holding herself tightly, also watching the door rattle. After countless
hours of observing her, this was something new. She didn�t do this very often.
The door finally flew open and someone staggered in. It was Jim, only a very
scared Jim. Not the kind of Jim I was used to seeing. 

&nbsp;

Jim just stood a little past the door entrance, looking
around the room wildly. He looked extremely disheveled; his normally small and
creepy eyes were wide and staring. He was also puffing audibly, like he was out
of breath. One of his pant legs looked darker, like someone had spilled
something on him. He wasn�t leaning on that leg, he was sort of half limping;
that was why he shuffled down the corridor. Most disturbing of all was the
bloody knife he held in his left hand. There was dried blood under his nails,
as well as some more fresh blood on his left hand. 

&nbsp;

He hesitated at the doorway, and then swiftly dived in
Kelly�s direction. She let out little yelp, and I could see them struggling on
the ground for a few brief moments. Jim finally straightened up and leered at
me from behind Kelly. He was holding her under the neck with his right hand,
leaning against the wall grotesquely. With his left hand, he held the blade of
the knife under her neck. Kelly was flailing in his grip, in some way unable to
hold herself up. One of her hands was clinging to his hand as it squeezed her neck, the other was groping around frantically, trying to
hold onto something. She grabbed his pants, the dark side I noticed, but her
hand slid off.

&nbsp;

Before I could even stand up, there was a loud noise and a
stampede of people ran into the cell. I was amazed at how quickly the cell
changed from empty to full. Someone pulled me onto the ground, face down, and
pulled my hands behind my back. I tried to struggle, but it got me nowhere. I
felt like if I moved my elbow it would snap right out of my arm, so I just lay
quietly on the ground. Looking up, from my odd angle I could see quite a few pairs
of feet in the room. 

&nbsp;

There were two people standing several feet from Jim,
pointing large scary looking guns at him. They looked like they just jumped out
of some action movie; both had strange vests and uniforms. There was a third
man, who I could only see from behind, but he was dressed impeccably in a dark
suit. Besides the fact that he was also pointing a gun at Jim, he almost looked
normal.

&nbsp;

Jim was still struggling with Kelly in the corner. She had
finally got some kind of grip on Jim�s pants, only her hand was covered in
blood, oddly enough. Jim was trying to adjust his position at the wall, still
holding her under the neck. He was leaning so far back it was no wonder Kelly
couldn�t keep her balance. The sound of Kelly and Jim disturbed the silence for
some time, until they somehow reached a lasting position, and everything became
still. 

&nbsp;

Jim was looking over Kelly�s head and staring at the people
around the cell. He looked� weak, standing against the wall, catching his
breath. Kelly also stared around the room, clearly scared to death. Her face
was a sickly white. Her eyes rested on mine and she gave me a pleading stare. I
looked down, there was nothing I could do anyway, I reasoned. 

&nbsp;

�I�ll� fucking kill her,� came
Jim�s rasping voice, breaking the silence. He paused in between words to
breathe.

&nbsp;

�It�s over, Jim,� replied the man in the suit slowly. There
could be no mistaking that voice. It was Gavin. Bastard.


&nbsp;

�It�s not!� Yelled Jim. �Get out
or� I�ll kill� this bitch,� he screamed, breathing in gasps. He didn�t look so
healthy, I thought.

&nbsp;

�And I would care� why?� asked Gavin. �You know this isn�t
about Kelly. It�s about the leak, the �source�. You know what I�m talking
about,� he concluded slowly. The same slow, calm, poisonous
voice. It was definitely Gavin. 

&nbsp;

Jim began to fulfil his threat, pushing the knife into
Kelly�s neck. She screamed and tried to pull the knife away from her neck,
grabbing the knife by the blade. Blood ran down her hand as she began crying,
the knife still cutting into her neck.

&nbsp;

I couldn�t watch Kelly get butchered by Jim. I wasn�t going
to sit quietly and let it happen, Gavin or not. Fortunately, whoever was
pulling down on me relaxed his grip somewhat; he was too engrossed in the
bloody scene in front of us. Taking advantage of that, I pushed back and tried
to stand up quickly. Whoever it was on top of me snapped out of his reverie
quickly and before I even got to my knees he slammed me back down on the
ground. My tits were crushed against the floor as he pushed down even harder
this time, pushing my hands farther into my back. I bit my tongue accidentally
and whimpered, kind of pathetically. Everyone else ignored me.

&nbsp;

Gavin could care less about me making futile escape
attempts, but he did seem to mind that his audience was more interested in
killing Kelly than listening to him. He stepped forward and ripped Kelly out of
Jim�s hands by the hair, throwing her back without looking at her. She screamed
and fell on the ground, her face inches from mine. I looked into her face and
she stared back, tears pouring out of her eyes. 

&nbsp;

�Don�t play games with me,� hissed Gavin, advancing on Jim
slowly. Jim had accidentally let go of the knife, and it lay on the ground next
to him. I couldn�t tell if he was even listening to Gavin, he was just staring
at the knife and Gavin in turn, as if deciding if he should make a grab for it.


&nbsp;

There was a nasty silence; Jim, still cornered, looked like
he would jump for the knife at any minute. I couldn�t tell what Gavin was doing, he had his back to me. Kelly was lying next to me on
the ground, making no effort to stand up or run away. I even noticed that the
door to the cell was open. 

&nbsp;

There was a loud scuffle and a bang. I gasped and saw Jim
slump against the back wall, bleeding from the stomach now. It wasn�t hard to
understand what happened, Jim probably tried to get his gun and Gavin shot him.
Jim was panting now, his hands holding his stomach and covered in blood. 

&nbsp;

�Who� did� you � tell�!� asked Gavin again, his voice rising
dangerously but going no higher than a whisper. Looking up at Jim lying there,
I could tell that something was missing from his face. Those creepy little eyes
had lost their glow; his face was expressionless. Was he dead? I wondered. On
one hand that was probably good, Jim deserved what he got. On the other, I
wished I didn�t actually have to watch all the gory details�

&nbsp;

�Jay� Jaysss�.sss�� rasped Jim. I
would have jumped in shock if I weren�t pinned to the ground. I could see blood
pouring out of his mouth as he tried to talk. 

&nbsp;

Gavin leaned down next to Jim and whispered something I
couldn�t hear. He then tapped him on the head once, drew back a little, and
shot him right in the forehead. 

&nbsp;

This time I actually screamed as Jim�s head flew back at a
crazy angle, blood flying out the back of his head and splattering on the back
wall. There was a little round hole in his forehead where the bullet went in,
his eyes wide and his mouth pulled open for some reason. I stared at him in
horror for a few seconds, transfixed by the sight.

&nbsp;

The room became quiet again and Gavin spoke under his breath
with one of the guards. They lowered their guns and were sneaking looks in my
direction.

&nbsp;

Another familiar face ambled into the room; it was the
skinny guy with the needles. His face brought back memories, and I shuddered.
He leered when he saw me looking at him, but walked past me and crouched near
Kelly. He had rubber gloves on, and turned her onto her back, holding her head
up with his hands. He appeared to be examining her, now looking at her bloody
hands.

&nbsp;

�Don�t bother,� said Gavin softly. �We�re done with these
two.� 

&nbsp;

The skinny guy understood more of that then I did, and stood
up, looking around the room. 

&nbsp;

�Cut off enough of Jim to fit in a shoebox and send it to
his friend, Jason. He�s next�� said Gavin, nodding at the two guards. 

&nbsp;

One of them picked up Kelly by the waist and dragged her out
of the room. Gavin walked after her and then the guard pinning me to the ground
pulled me up by my shoulders and steered me out of the cell. I couldn�t resist
a look back at the cell; seeing Jim leaning against the wall with a hole in his
head was something I never imagined I�d see. 

&nbsp;

Once in the hall outside the cell, the guard put me up
against the wall and then just left. No restraints, nothing. I saw Kelly
leaning against the wall next to me, her old idiotic expression of perpetual
surprise back on her face. I looked up and found myself staring into Gavin�s
gun, only several feet from my face.

&nbsp;

�I was supposed to do this a long time ago,� he said
hurriedly. He wasn�t as calm as he�d been when he killed Jim, but his gun
didn�t waver.

&nbsp;

�I�m tying up some loose ends, and I don�t really want any
more surprises from you,� � he waved his gun around � �and the only way to
really do that is if you�re, well, dead.� He was going to kill us? I couldn�t
understand this� I couldn�t cope with that answer. Dead?
Me?

&nbsp;

�Sorry for the wait,� he added quietly, and shot Kelly in
the stomach. I don�t know if she was expecting it or not, to be honest I didn�t
even know if she was listening to him. She made an uncharacteristic grunting
sound and bent over, holding her stomach. Slowly, her feet collapsed under her
and she slid down the wall, leaving a trail of blood on the wall. She came to
the bottom and lay still, a pool of blood beginning to
extend from her body. 

&nbsp;

My eyes froze on Kelly lying on the ground, dead. I couldn�t
believe it. She was dead� how did this all happen? Could this happen to me too?

&nbsp;

�Goodbye, Kate,� said Gavin quietly, and breaking my stare at
Kelly I looked up at Gavin. All I could see was his gun, blurred by my tears.
�No� don�t�� don�t kill me. I could almost see myself lying next to Kelly,
dead. Such a waste� my life, ending like this? I
couldn�t believe it� I wouldn�t let it happen. �Please, don�t shoot� don�t kill
me�� I kneeled in front of him, reaching out with shaking hands, hardly
realizing what I was doing.

&nbsp;

Gavin stared at me for thirty seconds, my heart pounding
painfully. At any minute he would shoot, and I would dead, gone, no more� His
gun moved back and I screamed, covering my eyes, but all he did was point it
up. Was he�?

&nbsp;

�I guess I shouldn�t kill you after all,� he mumbled,
holding the gun up. So that was it? I was safe? My heart stopped beating and I
looked up at him, still kneeling.

&nbsp;

�Will you do anything for me?� he asked quietly, looking at
me seriously.

&nbsp;

�Yes, yes, anything� I�ll do anything for you,� I breathed.
I couldn�t believe my luck, and I wasn�t about to ruin it because of my pride.
�I�ll be your��

&nbsp;

I heard a giggle and looked back up. He was laughing, wiping
his eyes with a gloved hand.

&nbsp;

�God, I love it when they beg,� he said, and as if he was
still suppressing giggles snorted a couple times.

&nbsp;

I was crushed. How could he be so� cruel? So
evil? I no longer cared for him, for anything. Maybe I should die. I
couldn�t stand this world anymore. Looking down again, I saw his polished shoes
and wanted to spit on them. Instead, I just lay down and curled up in the fetal
position, waiting for him to shoot me. Get this over with, bastard. I�ll see
you in hell�

&nbsp;

As abruptly as my self-righteous anger started, it stopped,
and I no longer hated him. I just pitied myself, pitied myself for all that had
happened to me. Crying, I choked back a sob and looked up at Gavin. He had finished
enjoying himself and was pointing the gun at me again. �Goodbye,� he said, and
the gun clicked.

&nbsp;

I just continued to stare at him, at the gun. Was I dead? I
didn�t feel anything� I remember how all those dumb movies where they said, �if this is dying, it�s not so bad,� it really wasn�t. I
moved my hands down, expecting to see blood pouring out, but there was nothing.
Looking back at Gavin, he was shoving his hand into his pockets, the gun opened
at an unnatural angle. 

&nbsp;

He had just run out. The stupidity of this whole situation
made me turn red. His stupid little revolver had already been emptied 6 times,
the bastard. I couldn�t believe that he was going to calmly reload in front of
me, and then kill me. This was totally insane.

&nbsp;

�You know, this never happened before,� he said, as if
talking about the weather. �Never ran out, and I must�ve killed� oh I dunno.�
He was filling the gun with bullets, relaxed, as if he was fixing a watch for a
customer and just making conversation while he worked. 

&nbsp;

He put the last one in and pushed the gun together with a
snap. �All set, now,� he said to himself and shot the wall as if to check. I
screamed, thinking he had just shot me. I was shaking on the floor, my heart
thumping audibly. This was so surreal.

&nbsp;

Gavin pointed the gun at me, again, the familiar pose. I
stared at the gun, my hands shaking, my face covered in tears, I must have
looked really pathetic. This time Gavin actually looked like he was having
sincere second thoughts. I hoped anyway.

&nbsp;

�Y�know� hmmm�� He was debating with himself. Just make up
your mind already, I don�t have all day. �You see if I don�t shoot you, then I
can preserve my little record� I don�t think it counts if I misfire and then
don�t actually kill you, you see?� I couldn�t tell if he was rambling for my
benefit or his own.

&nbsp;

�Alright, whatever. No one knows
who you are, you don�t know anything, and no one gives a shit about you. Lets go.� As abruptly, he put his gun in his pocket and
started down the hallway. He was letting me go now? 

&nbsp;

�Don�t push your luck,� a voice said behind me. Turning
around I saw one of the guards chewing something behind me, spitting a brown
substance on the floor next to me. �Go already,� he said again, nudging me with
the toe of his boot. 

&nbsp;

Dazed, I stood up and walked down the hallway, after Gavin.
He was whistling, the sound rattling around in my head and hurting my ears. I
could barely walk, my knees unwilling to support me. I
had to hold on to the wall to maintain my balance.

&nbsp;

Not far along the corridor, Gavin held open a door and
smiled at me, gesturing in a mocking manner. �Ladies first, Kate,� he said in a
honeyed voice.

&nbsp;

I walked in the door he held open for me, and onto a
stairwell. Gavin nudged me in the ribs, and I walked up the stairs, slowly,
unsteadily, holding on to the railing for support. Gavin�s loud obnoxious
whistling echoed in the air.

&nbsp;

We reached the top, and there was a large door at the end.
It had a lock on it, the usual, whatever. Just open it Gavin, let�s get this
over with. But he didn�t feel like opening the door, since he just stood behind
me whistling. 

&nbsp;

�Open the door,� he said quietly, and resumed his whistling.
Ok, I thought, you can have your fun. Who cares? Reaching out I grasped the
door handle, pulled, and as expected it was locked. Now you open it, I thought.


&nbsp;

Looking back, I saw him still whistling, leaning against the
wall. He was whistling the main melody from Star Wars, of all things. I had no
strength left to think with, so I just sighed and stood in front of the door. 

&nbsp;

�Here, let me show you.� He came up behind me, and pushed me
against the door. I obligingly turned my head to the side and let him push me
against the door. Whatever floats your boat�

&nbsp;

�Now you take the handle, like this,� taking my hand in his
he put it over the handle. I wasn�t interested in playing along and my hand
slid off the handle back down once he let go. 

&nbsp;

�No no no, like this,� he said
again, putting my hand against the handle and holding it there with his hand.
�Now we bend it down, and�� he pushed against my hand,
turning the handle down. Putting his other hand against my back, he pushed and
the door flew open under my weight.

&nbsp;

We staggered through the door, still holding on to the
handle. Wow, how funny. Gavin was roaring with laughter.

&nbsp;

�Not so clever, are we,� he said in between bursts of
laughter. What was so funny about this? You shoot me, screw up, and now you
tell me to open doors? What? 

&nbsp;

�It even says �Push� all over the door.� He added, giving
the door a final look before letting it close. He continued ridiculing me over
the door, and I just closed my eyes. I couldn�t hear what he was saying; I was
just enjoying the cool air. We weren�t outside, but from the dim lighting we
looked like were in a parking garage. I leaned back against the wall and
savored the cool air, the temporary freedom. I had been stuck inside a cell for
who knows how many hours, and the feeling of finally getting out was�
indescribable. 

&nbsp;

I broke out of my little reverie when I heard a new voice
talking. Looking over, Gavin had finished taunting me about the door and was
talking quietly with some other guy. The other guy looked pretty scared, mostly
nodding his head and smiling. I could barely make out what they were saying,
but I didn�t care enough to listen. 

&nbsp;

�Kate� Kate! Come over here,� called Gavin loudly, and I
opened my eyes again, looking at him. The other guy was staring at me, his eyes
round. Finally, someone who had a normal reaction to seeing a naked woman, I
thought. 

&nbsp;

�Enjoy yourself,� he said to his
new buddy, and slapped him on the back. The other guy was staring at me
fixedly. Our eyes met, but he didn�t look away. Advancing on me, he got up in
front of me and started fumbling with his pants. Oh no, not this�

&nbsp;

He was standing directly in front of me, pretty much pinning
me against the wall. I looked over at Gavin, pleading with my eyes. He was busy
lighting a cigarette and didn�t notice.

&nbsp;

�That�s it, yeah, that�s it�� said the guy, pushing down on
my shoulders and talking in an unnaturally low voice. I resigned myself to what
I was going to do, and just kneeled obediently. He took his slim looking cock
out of his pants, and put it in my mouth. He was already semi-erect, and I
could feel it expand as it touched my mouth.

&nbsp;

I just opened my mouth and tried to imagine I was far away,
floating somewhere with Max� I caught sight of Gavin smoking next to us,
shattering my illusion. He looked back at me, and smiled, giving me the thumbs
up. I looked away, utterly depressed.

&nbsp;

The guy was having much more fun than I was, I thought
glumly. I was just kneeling with my mouth open, like a some
freakish sex toy while he rubbed and groaned all over my face. His cock reeked
of stale piss, and his pubic hairs brushed my eyes. 

&nbsp;

After several minutes, his cock began to twitch inside me,
and I realized a little too late what was coming. I pushed his short little
dick out of my mouth, but he had already shot some of his sticky fluid down my
throat. The rest landed on my face as he pulled out himself, clearly enjoying
himself immensely. 

&nbsp;

I tried to expel the salty crap in my mouth, but it was
already too far down my throat. Coughing strangely, I swallowed and looked up.
The guy was wiping his cock with a tissue, and shoving it back into his pants. 

&nbsp;

�Thanks,� he said breathlessly, dropped the tissue, and
walked away. I could feel the cum on my cheek, and I
reached to wipe it off. That didn�t work so well, since all that happened was
it got stuck on my fingers, and my
face. Picking up his spent tissue, I wiped my hands on it, but dropped it when
I heard a nasty squishing sound. Ugh.

&nbsp;

I automatically looked over at where Gavin was smoking, and
did a double take. He wasn�t there?! I could see the ash on the ground, the
cigarette butt, but no Gavin. I was free!

&nbsp;

I could hardly believe my luck. He shoots at me, runs out of
ammo, and then lets me go. He was one weird dude, but I wasn�t going to push my
luck. The only problem was� I was stark naked. With cum on my
cheek. And no cash. What the hell, I�ll figure
something out, I reasoned.

&nbsp;

There was a big bold �3� on the door, and I began walking up
levels. The garage was relatively empty, and poorly lit. Strange thing was, I expected it to get brighter as I went up. It actually
seemed to get darker; until I realized it must be night outside. I hadn�t
expected that, somehow I expected it to be morning, or some reasonable waking
hour. Then again, it�s not as if you can tell from inside a cell.

&nbsp;

Reaching the top, I ducked under the gate and� outside. It
was amazing, I had dreamed of this for a long time, and it was everything I
expected it to be and more. The night was cool, dark, and the moon prominent in
the sky. The only trouble was all I could see down both sides of the road were
closed shops, and swaying street lamps. Where was I? 

&nbsp;

I started walking on the sidewalk, hoping to see some
indication of where I was. Maybe I could get a phone and call Jessica. �Taylor
the Tailor�, read one shop. �Tarrot-readings, Crystal ball readings,� read
another. What is this bullshit?

&nbsp;

The beating of some music turned much higher than was
healthy broke the silence. I looked back and saw a car crazily weaving down the
road, the music getting louder as it came. The people in the car hardly seemed
the type to help me out, and I wished they would just drive by, 

&nbsp;

The car screeched to a stop next to me, on the wrong side of
the road. Some kid rolled down the window and stuck half his body out, yelling
something at me. I ignored him.

&nbsp;

�You wanna ride?� he asked indistinctly, turning the music
down. I kept walking, quickening my pace. The car followed me, riding up on the
curb.

&nbsp;

�C�mon, we all want you here,� he said drunkenly. I could
hear shouts and laughter from inside the car. �We�ll pay you good,� he added.

&nbsp;

I was getting scared now, the car bumping on and off the
curb next to me. There were more shouts from inside, and then some fat guy
walked out the side. Accompanied by catcalls from inside the car, he walked up
to me and grabbed me around the waist from behind. I screamed and tried to free
myself, but he didn�t even notice.

&nbsp;

He whooped and began pushing his hips against me obscenely,
almost knocking me over. No one came; no one heard the noise we were making. I
suddenly wished Gavin were still here.

&nbsp;

�Let�s go,� the fat one said, dragging me towards the car. I
struggled and screamed, but he didn�t care in the least.

&nbsp;

�Wait� hang on are you sure� uh,�
asked the guy hanging out the window. He looked scared, but also very excited. Idiot.

&nbsp;

�Bring that bitch!� someone yelled from inside the car, and
the fat guy did just that, pushing me into the car horizontally. I barely
ducked in time, my head rubbing against the frame of the car.

&nbsp;

I landed with my head in some drunken guy�s lap, my feet on
the fat guy�s lap as he got in the car after me. The tires screeched and we were
off again, bumping along the road crazily. They weren�t very interested in
foreplay I noticed, as the fat guy behind me turned me over and quickly shoved
his already hard cock right into me. 

&nbsp;

I was screaming and crying, still trying to get away somehow,
but no one seemed to notice. Or care. I could almost feel the excitement in
them as the fat guy slammed into me over and over again, pushing my entire body
forward each time. My hands scrambled for some kind of grip as I felt the guy
on top of me overbalance on the small bench in the back of the car. He fell
down onto the floor heavily, with me on top of him. He unfolded himself with
some difficulty, and readjusted himself so that I was lying directly on top of
him, face to face. 

&nbsp;

He smiled crazily and kissed me roughly, his cock spurting
inside me. He almost suffocated me with his alcohol-laced breath.

&nbsp;

Not everyone in the car was happy with him hogging me
apparently, and some other kid got tried to pull me away by the waist. The fat
guy didn�t want to lose me just yet, so he held on to me by the neck, pushing
me into an awkward position with my ass in the air. 

&nbsp;

That suited whoever was pulling me just fine, since he
stopped pulling and just rammed his cock as hard as he could into my ass. I
almost passed out from the pain, it felt like someone
was ripping my legs apart with each thrust.

&nbsp;

I moaned into the fat guy�s mouth, my body lurching forward
with each thrust. Everything was a blur; his idiotic face one big reddish blob.
He was no longer �kissing� me, but trying to extricate himself from under me.
He managed to get into a sitting position, my face rubbing against his
genitals. His pants were around his ankles; they must have gotten stuck when he
pulled himself out. 

&nbsp;

He was saying something to me, but I couldn�t hear a word he
said. I was gasping for breath, trying to squirm away from the guy raping my
ass. He didn�t seem to mind, just pulling my head towards his genitals. My
mouth wrapped around them, but I couldn�t taste or feel anything. 

&nbsp;

Seconds later, everyone in the car was thrown forward as the
driver slammed on the breaks. I accidentally bit down on someone�s cock, and my
tongue. Instantly pulling up, I could already feel blood on my lips and someone
yelling hoarsely. Before I knew what happened there was a deafening crash and I
was flung forward again, this time much harder. I bounced off the floor,
ricocheted off the front seats and landed halfway under the backseat. 

&nbsp;

I passed out briefly, still dazed by what was going on. The
car wasn�t moving anymore, but I couldn�t see anything outside the car. Some
blood was collecting under the seat next to me. The silence was broken
occasionally by moans coming from inside the car. I could hear a siren in the
distance, the sound getting louder as it came closer. I couldn�t understand
why, why did this always happen to me� so I just lay down my head and cried
myself unconscious.
