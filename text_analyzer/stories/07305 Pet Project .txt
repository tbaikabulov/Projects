Chapter One
�Jared I thought we were just going to spend the evening together. I don&#8217;t really want to go to a party, especially if there&#8217;s a bunch of people that I don&#8217;t really like there.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Relax, it&#8217;s not even a party; it&#8217;s just a couple close friends and they&#8217;re all really nice; no one will cause any drama.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Is there anyone there from our old group?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Um, I think Pat will be there, and it&#8217;s Timmy&#8217;s house. You know Timmy.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know Pat.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We pulled up to a small rickety house that was dimly lit. I could hear music humming through the walls of the house as I opened the door of the van. My ex boyfriend had taken me to his friend&#8217;s house to loosen up his nerves or something like that. There was a bombardment of people as we entered through the front door. It was a small one story house and the living room was obviously crowded. Pat and Timothy raced up to meet Jared. I recognized both of them. It had been several years and it was strange to see their old faces. They were both shocked to see me as well and embraced me immediately; forgetting how awkward that would be for me in their drunken state. The evening went generally well; I had a couple drinks and spent most of the time talking to Timmy. He was graceful and easy to talk to and he was more confident than last time I met him. He also had this contemplative look that kissed my curiosity, but I stopped myself from going any farther because my ex was right there watching me. When everyone had fallen asleep and the place cleared out, we continued to talk; there were so many things we agreed on and we couldn&#8217;t get enough of each other.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the morning, my ex took me back to my apartment, with a shook up look on his face. He had definitely regretted ever bringing me over to his friends house, but I was so infatuated by then that I thought it was fate. Later on that evening I found myself knocking on Timothy&#8217;s front door. I had memorized my way over to the house and it didn&#8217;t take long to find it again. He looked confused at first, but as soon as he saw me his face began to glow and welcomed me into the house. There was an attempt to clean up with a broom leaning against the living room wall and a garage bag half full of beer cans. Pat was one of the few accessories in the room, lying on the couch, which helped furnish the vaguely empty room. He grumbled, rolled over, peeled open his eyes and smiled at me.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hey Kat,� he said and rolled back to where he was before.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tim smiled, shrugged it off and walked towards the kitchen. I followed him, but the walk was silent because I couldn&#8217;t think of anything to say.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What&#8217;s going on?� he asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I thought I&#8217;d just stop by,� I answered playfully.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Did you want to watch a movie or something?&#8217; he suggested.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Sure.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He turned on the stove after he placed a pot of water on one of the burners.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m gonna make some noodles, do you want any?� He asked casually.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yea, that&#8217;d be great,� I answered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We moved Pat over onto the end of the couch and sat down closer to each other. We had started watching Dumb and Dumber on the cube-like TV that sat in the front room. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What do you think of me?� he asked quietly, so that Pat couldn&#8217;t part take in our private conversation.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I like you,� I answered honestly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s enough to pursue this relationship we have. My ex Jared might get upset; he looked really irritated this morning,� I added.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So you just want to be friends?� he concluded.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That&#8217;d be good.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He clammed up and stayed quiet the rest of the time. The noodles were ready and he handed me a bowl of them. That was the only time he spoke that night. He obviously didn&#8217;t want to be just friends. I felt disappointed because I did like him, but I wasn&#8217;t willing to ruin his relationship with Jared over it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Did you see Tim after the party?� Jared asked when he called me later that night.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yea I did, I&#8217;m not gonna lie,� I answered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Did you guys do anything?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, we just watched a movie. I told him we should just be friends because I didn&#8217;t want your friendship getting in the way.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m sure.� He said in a passive way.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I knew that going over to Timmy&#8217;s house without an invitation probably wasn&#8217;t a good idea, but I had already made that mistake. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m sorry if you don&#8217;t believe me, but I&#8217;m not planning on going back there anytime soon.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We finished up the conversation and he didn&#8217;t call me for a few days. I became familiar with my daily routine of staying at home, and I almost forgot about the whole disturbing drama.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Timothy wanted to invite you over to a party we&#8217;re having at his house. If it was up to me I wouldn&#8217;t have invited you, but it&#8217;s his house and he wants you over. He said that you guys are just friends and I guess I don&#8217;t have a choice so you should be there tonight,� Jared said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He wanted my answer to be &#8216;no&#8217;, but I had become bored with my life and wanted to see Timmy again. I felt like he hadn&#8217;t given up on me and that intrigued me. I would continue to deny him, but that didn&#8217;t mean that I couldn&#8217;t enjoy a little chase and the generous attention.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That evening Timmy hurriedly answered the door to let me in, I could see Jared sitting on the couch; he wasn&#8217;t completely alone. Pat was sitting near him with a pipe in hand. I watched as he slowly blew out the smoke and handed it back to Jared. I felt more at ease that Jared had something to do and wouldn&#8217;t have to spend the night bickering about me, and joined Tim in the kitchen.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I talked to Jared and he doesn&#8217;t mind if we&#8217;re together,� Timmy said as I entered the kitchen.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There were a few people standing around and drinking, while one younger girl was rummaging through the fridge.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s a good idea,� I whined.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You don&#8217;t like me anymore?� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I like you. It&#8217;s just that this is an awkward situation and I don&#8217;t want to make anyone feel bad.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�If you like me and I like you, we should just be together,� he argued coolly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t think so,� I said flatly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why don&#8217;t we go in here?� he handed me a drink and led me into his bedroom. I didn&#8217;t see this as a lure, but just a place to talk in private. He asked me to finish my drink with him and we both chugged. Then, he opened up a drawer and pulled out a pipe with a large bowl. He packed it full of greens that looked like hash, but he called it opium lettuce.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It&#8217;s not addictive. It&#8217;ll just make you feel good,&#8217; he promised.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The door creaked open and a guy I didn&#8217;t know peeped in. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What are you guys doing in here?� he asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We&#8217;re gonna go on a ride. Do you wanna come?� Tim asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you guys going to Taco Bell?� he asked with a wide smile on his face. Tim lifted up the pipe and smiled back.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Not that kind of ride; we&#8217;re gonna take a trip to wonderland,� he said and laughed. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh, hell yeah! Hold up, don&#8217;t start without me,� he jolted out of the room and brought back a girl with him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They held out two more beers for us and sat down on the opposite side of the bed. He lit up the pipe and took a huge first hit, but it seemed weak compared to the one his friend took. It was finally my turn and I took the biggest hit I could while he held the pipe. I let it out and took a few deep breathes to replenish myself. The room grew quiet. Their smiling faces began to spin and I let my head rest against the back board. I heard them laughing and I smiled to myself. They were laughing about me, but I didn&#8217;t care. The smoke cleared up as they stopped passing the pipe around. The drawer opened up again and they all started laughing wickedly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ah man, this is gonna be great,� the stranger said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I tried to pick my head up to see what they were all talking about, but it was too heavy and I couldn&#8217;t convince myself to move. He rolled my head over to the side and I felt a cold drop of cool liquid on the back of my neck. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What was that,� I managed to ask. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Don&#8217;t worry about; it&#8217;ll make you feel amazing. Do you wanna sit up and finish your beer?� he asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I managed to sit up once I put my mind to it and the high I had sort of wore off. They all sat around drinking beer for a minute and finally the couple left. As the guy walked out he touched the frame of the door and laughed, she giggled hesitantly too. He pulled out a pack of cigarettes and lit one. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you smoke?� he asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Not really,� I answered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What does that mean? Have you ever smoked?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you want a cigarette?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He put one in the crack of my lips and lit it up. I sucked in and let the smoke fill up lungs. There was a strange tingle, but I didn&#8217;t cough although I would have felt the need at any other time. I blew out and took a couple more drags.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What did you give me?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What are you talking about?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I feel weird,� I moaned sleepily.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cigarette was slowly slipping out of my fingers; I watched as the smoke twisted and turned. He pulled it out of my hand as it was about to fall and put it out on the ash tray near him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t want you to worry, so I&#8217;ll just let you know in the morning. It&#8217;s harmless so just enjoy the evening. Do you want to go out there?� he asked, pointing towards the door.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, I feel very tired. I might just want to stay in bed.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ok, I&#8217;ll let you sleep and I&#8217;ll come get you in a couple hours and see how you&#8217;re doing,� he said and left.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I crawled under the blankets and let my face rub against the soft covers. My eyes became sensitive to the light so I covered my face up and fell asleep immediately. I felt like I had slept for about a half an hour before I woke up from a loud crash in the over room. My body felt like it was floating, but since it was completely weightless I wouldn&#8217;t really move. I finally managed to have my fingers creep up and I peeped from under the blanket; the room was spinning and much more colorful than I remembered it. Timothy walked in and crawled in bed with me. He pulled the hair away from my neck and started kissing it. My body wasn&#8217;t willing to move and my mind wasn&#8217;t against the idea either. The consequences were indifferent after the consumption of drugs.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I like you and I think you&#8217;re beautiful and you should be mine. I know that after tonight you won&#8217;t want to come around here, and that the only reason you ever showed up was because Jared invited you, so I&#8217;m going to create a solution. I&#8217;m going to keep you here and eventually you&#8217;ll learn to love me,� he whispered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My heart skipped a beat out of fear; he was completely insane. I moved and tried to roll away from him but he grabbed me by the neck and pulled me closer.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;ll learn to love me,� he repeated his final words.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He pulled my hands behind my back and tied them up with something. I felt the pressure of the binds and started to panic. He pulled down my pants, took a look and tore them off the rest of the way. Then he pulled up my shirt and to his surprise the click to my bra was in front. He opened up my bra and examined my breasts; cupping them and pinching my nipples to see how well they would swell. 
�Very nice,� he said.
When he was finished, he grabbed me by the neck and I could tell that he had put his cock in me from all the sudden pressure. At first I was alarmed, but as I closed my eyes everything melted away and all I could feel was my soft warm pussy and his penetrating dick pushing against the walls. It almost became a lucid dream as I imagined sex as an ongoing massage inside my wet folds. But it didn&#8217;t take long before my endorphins dried up and I realized that he was raping me and that all of this was against my will. I opened my eyes to fully understand what was going on. Some how it had all felt so good and I began to wonder if I had agreed to this. But as I pulled on my restraints I couldn&#8217;t believe that he was actually violating me. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What are you doing?� I screamed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was waiting for him to snap out of it too and tell me that this was all a game and that he didn&#8217;t want to do anything I wasn&#8217;t willing to.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m raping you,� he said simply.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My mind started to rattle. He actually admitted fully to what he was doing to me. My slow, confused high was over and I was shot into an extreme state of panic.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please stop! Oh, god, oh god, please, please stop. You don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing!� I cried and continued to jerk. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But he only smiled and pushed deeper into me. All I could think of was how to make him stop and I continuously tried to pull away from his hard, erect penis. But he kept his grip on me and pursued his plan.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My body started to shake and all I kept doing was pulling on the restraints to release myself. I couldn&#8217;t feel the pain from the shock I was in. I felt smaller and smaller as the bed grew and so did Timothy, he over powered me and beat against my sore, torn vaginal walls.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�God, please stop!� I continued to wail.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Listen bitch, if you don&#8217;t stop fucking around I&#8217;m going to cum inside of you!� he threatened.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The immediate fear of becoming pregnant and having a baby in remembrance of this night sent me over the edge and I numbed up again. He smiled after the realization that I was still listening to him and continued to fuck me. I shut my eyes and tried to focus on something else, but all I could feel was his cock beating and out; in and out. The sensation was painful and burned, but I was too afraid to say anything or move away. I couldn&#8217;t tell how much time had gone by because my deranged perception of reality and the on going feeling of this experience lapped over and over again in my mind. I kept thinking the same things; when it would end and how much it hurt. He pulled out completely and did not reenter. There was a long pause and I felt a sigh of relief exit my lungs.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you afraid of me?� he asked gently. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes,� I barely managed to say.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;ll make a perfect slave,� he laughed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;re not letting me go?� I cried.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I never said I would; what gave you that idea?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Somehow I had forgotten that he had promised to keep me in the house. He would use me like this until I either died or ran away. I reassured myself that he was just one man and that this was a residential house and that once I was off the drugs and could think straight I would be able to escape.&nbsp; I lay quietly as he put my pants back on and pulled a belt out of one of his clothes drawers to tie my feet. He then wrapped my body up in one of the blankets on the bed and picked me up. He carried me out into the living room and through the kitchen without anyone thinking anything was wrong. I tried to make panic with my eyes for someone to catch onto, but no one saw. I was too afraid to yell out for help because I knew that if my plan didn&#8217;t work and he was still as violent and worked up as he was earlier I would be in even more trouble. He set me down on a chair and pulled out a key from his pocket. He used it to open a door that was locked earlier. It led down a flight of dimly lit stairs. He picked me up again and kicked the door shut behind him as he led me down. There was one light bulb on the far end of the basement that was lit, but it barely showed off the room. He took me over to the other end, which was completely dark, and set me down on a hard, twin sized mattress held by a metal frame.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I watched as he left the room without untying me or unwrapping the blanket. It took me a minute to realize that I was finally alone and could make an escape. I felt around my wrists and knew that I was being held by another belt. I managed to find the end of it and push it in enough to give it some leeway. I fingered the belt up through the buckle and pulled it out. This all took me a great deal of time and my arms were extremely sore when I had finally pulled the belt out of the buckle, but all that matters was that my hands were free. I celebrated quietly and untied my feet soon after. The room was still dark, but my eyes had adjusted as I crawled out of the bed and tip toed my way to the stairs. I inched up to the top and pressed my ear against the door to hear whether music was still playing out there and to make sure that no one would be able to hear me over it. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The door was locked when I tried to open it. I knew that I wasn&#8217;t going to be able to break it open by myself, but the state I was in convinced me that I could find a way, so I walked back downstairs to find a light switch and something to break the door open with. As I felt around the walls of the room I realized that there was nothing to switch the lights on with. So I felt around the flat surfaces of the room a found a screw driver. I went back upstairs and started to chip at the door knob; I beat around the sides of it where the metal met the wood to see if I could dislodge the knob.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My adrenaline kicked back up into gear as I began beating the door with all my strength. I punched a hole about the size of my fist through the door next to the lock and reached my fingers in. I fiddled with anything that would click or turn as I wiggled the knob with my other hand. I was already envisioning a clean escape out the back door as the lock finally gave way and I thrust the door open. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I literally felt the blood drain from my face as I saw Timothy standing three feet away, smoking a cigarette with his friend from earlier. They were both surprised at my rushed entry, but Timothy looked like he knew I would do something like that. I didn&#8217;t have anything left to do, but throw down my last card and yell for help.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please help me; he&#8217;s going to kill me! Please help!� I cried, but my voice was straining and no one caught onto my cry except for the two of them.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Is she ok man?� he asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Timothy had already grabbed me by the arm to keep me from running away. I hit him over and over again, but it didn&#8217;t even faze him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; �She&#8217;s tripping hard! She was freaking out earlier so I took her down to the basement to put her to sleep in the extra bedroom, but it looks like she flipped out and broke my door. It wasn&#8217;t even locked and she punched a fucking hole through it.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He wiggled the door knob to show that it was open, but I had opened it! It was locked before! I looked at him frantically and suddenly noticed the screw driver that was clenched in my fist.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Calm down girly,� his friend said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I dropped the screw driver and thought about how absolutely crazy I probably looked. I wasn&#8217;t tied up or naked or even evidently raped because he hadn&#8217;t left any marks. His door was broken and I had a screw driver shaking in my hand. I was all over the place and he was completely cool. My eyes fell to the ground. Was this all a misunderstanding? Would I wake up the next morning and find myself in a guest bedroom downstairs?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I stopped struggling against his grip and followed him downstairs again. When he shut the door and led me back to the bed he lost his cool and we were back to playing his game.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Listen you psycho bitch; I thought I had you tied up pretty well, but you are way too over determined. You are definitely in lock down now and will be until I think that you are properly trained. Tonight I&#8217;ll let you rest, but you are getting punished tomorrow for the action you showed tonight. I&#8217;ll show you who&#8217;s the boss and when you&#8217;re free to move about you&#8217;ll be so fucking scared that you won&#8217;t move an inch without my permission,� he hissed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He shoved me down on the bed and I heard a clanking noise from the bottom of the bed. He pulled out a heavy metal collar about two inches wide and quarter inch thick an clamped it around my neck. It had one large loop in the front and two conjoined ones in the back. He snapped the back shut and hung a huge dangling lock onto the two loops in the back that came together to hold the collar closed. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the front he attached a heavy industrial chain that snapped locked onto the loop and the other end was attached near the bed to a loop on the concrete basement wall. That end snapped shut as well. I looked up at him just in time to have him slap me against the face hard and order me to open my mouth. I followed his order, knowing that he would punish me heavily if I didn&#8217;t. He stuffed a soft rubbed ball inside my mouth and pinched my lips shut with his fingers. I waited with my lips pursed around the smooth playful ball as he rummaged in the darkness for more tools. He came back and stuffed ear plugs inside my ears. It only took another minute to drape my head with a leather hood and zip it in the back.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t hear or see anything in the darkness of the hood. It had a cold smooth rubbery outside with a zipper that led down to a small lock on the bottom. I let my hands explore the thick chain that could only be opened with a key that would have to punch through a smack hole on either end.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The only openings on the mask were the nostril holes and the ball was too large to spit out of my mouth. The inside of the mask was soft and felt like the inside of leather material. After I was satisfied exploring my restraints I felt his hand run down my arm. He had been watching me the whole time. I quivered and curled up into a small ball on the bed. He pulled down my pants and spread my legs. I tried to keep them closed in fear of what he would do to me, but he spread then open again and slapped the inside of my thighs to remind me of my helplessness. I waved my hands around to push him away, but I couldn&#8217;t tell where he was at. He slapped me again as one of my hands brushed past his hair and I let them down in obedience. He dipped his fingers inside of my vag and caressed my g spot. I cried in undesirable pleasure, but he continued to stroke me. He pulled his fingers out and rubbed my clit lightly with his warm wet fingers. I cringed again in pleasure. But he did not pursue the action this time. And after a while I thought he had left because my pants were still down but he never touched me again. I pulled them up but he didn&#8217;t stop me. I feel sleep a few minutes later because I was completely exhausted and expecting to wake up from this dream to see that in reality nothing was wrong.

***
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I woke up my face was drenched with facial exertion. I grabbed at my face to find that the mask was still on. I was completely sober by now and terrified that I was in the same situation I had been in when I feel asleep. I jumped out of bed and the felt around to see if I could find a key, but the chain attached to my collar wouldn&#8217;t let me reach anything around me except for the bed. I pulled on the mask thinking of a way to get it off. Slipping my finger underneath the collar of the mask I inched it open a little. I managed to slip two of my fingers further in and tilt my head until I could barely reach an ear plug. I wiggled my head and the mask around until the ear piece fell out. I could hear again and some of my sanity had come back to me. Encouraged by my victory, I started tearing at the back of the mask, trying to get the zipper to break open. Once in a while I would stop and listen for noises upstairs but it seemed to be that either Timothy was sleeping or away somewhere; the house was completely silent. I pulled at the zipper vigorously, grabbing pieces of the rubber mask and tearing at the buckled seam. There was a faint rip and I stuck my finger in through the weak point in the zipper, in the center, where if finally gave way. I ran my finger down the line and it came loose. But the mask seemed more difficult to deal with than I had expected. The lock was still closed and sealed at the bottom and I couldn&#8217;t pull it off. Instead, I turned the mask around and could see through the zipper hole.&nbsp; I spit out my ball gag immediately and picked out my other ear plug. After that I started to examine my surroundings. There was a bed, wooden chair, shelves along the wall that held boxes. Rings attached to the walls all around; some low to the ground, others on the wall and even some hanging from the ceiling. Across from me were a long table and the light fixture from before. There were no windows in the basement and the only other light was the one directly above me, which was turned on now.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I looked closer at chain, it had a tiny hole that could unlock the chain, but nothing was going to help with the mask or the color just yet. I looked around, trying to think of anything to use as a key for the chain. I looked at the mattress and pressed down on the springs to feel their size; too big. Then there was a moment of clarity and I looked down at my shirt. I pulled off the bra I was wearing and chewed through the material until I got to the metal wiring. I pulled out about an inch and pressed it through the hole. There was a sharp pop and the end of the chain came loose. I set it on the floor quietly and walked over to the boxes. I was looking for keys as I found chains, ropes, vibrators, clamps, dildos, butt plugs, collars, cuffs and things that I couldn&#8217;t even figure out. I was half way through the boxes as I opened up a small jewelry looking case. Needles, piercing jewelry and keys! They were all assorted and labeled. For being a psychopath this guy was pretty well kept and organized. I pulled out the only labeled &#8216;mask 1&#8217; and tried it out. The small key worked and I pulled off the mask. I threw both things to the floor and started sorting through the keys for one that could unlock my collar. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The door clicked. How did I not hear his footsteps upstairs? A wave of panic fell over me as I set the box down and looked around for somewhere to hide. I changed my mind and opened the next box. Luckily it was full of whips. I grabbed a paddle that was resting in the large arrangement and snuck up to the corner where the stairs turned in. His footsteps were slow. He wasn&#8217;t expecting anything, if he had heard any noises he must have assumed that they were noises of me struggling for freedom or from fear. He was even whistling softly as he turned the corner. I was afraid to be brave, but I wasn&#8217;t weak enough for him to put me in this circumstance and get away with it. Wack! I hit him right in the face with paddle. He grabbed his face with pain and surprise, just to give me enough room to kick him in his privates. He grabbed his crotch as I jolted past him up the stairs. The door was waiting for me; I was seconds away from freedom, but then I noticed something. The hole I had punched in it the night before was sealed up. He had put some sort of sealant on it until it could get repaired properly and lock was in working order again. I ran up to it and tried to push through the substance, but it was solid. The door was locked. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I looked back downstairs to see that he was come back to his old self. I was cornered, literally, with all three walls around me. He started walking up the stairs.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Katherine, you&#8217;ve been a very bad girl. How many times are you planning on trying to run away? You haven&#8217;t learned anything yet. I&#8217;ve been too gracious with you and even when I&#8217;m not; it&#8217;s still too easy for you. Now I know how much you can really take. Come down here and be a good girl; if you listen to me than I might go easy on you,� he said in a calm still voice as he paced slowly. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I didn&#8217;t move.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;ll only be making this harder for yourself; are you going to disobey me one more time? You&#8217;ve got nowhere to run, why do you insist on going against my will?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was going to fight until it was impossible and I still had energy left to do it. If he was gonna lock me in here I would tear his dick off, watch him bleed and call it self defense. Those keys were going to be mine.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Alright, you&#8217;re decision,� he said and grabbed at me as he took the last step.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I tried to punch his face put missed. He grabbed my wrist and twisted it. I kneed him once in the thigh as he tried to pull my twisted arm behind my back. I used my other hand to swing back and grab his hair; I pulled a chunk out and he let go of my wrist. Then I pulled his head down and bit it. He plunged his head into my chest and knocked me to the floor. I hit my head against the door. Immediately, he jumped on top of me and grabbed the back of the collar. He pulled on it from behind until it started choking me and used his other hand to beat my head rhythmically against the door. I flailed my hands around, punching and scratching at him. He stopped choking me and grabbed my hands, pressed them against the ground and put his knees on them, pressing down harder every time I tried to move them. I tried kneeing him from behind, but as soon as I started doing that he choked me out again. I tried to cough and panic as he continued to press on my throat, but nothing worked. He leaned in closer and whispered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;ll stop when you calm down,� he said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I let my muscles relax and tried to avoid wanting to breath. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;d like to offer you a chance to get up and walk yourself downstairs, but I don&#8217;t trust you anymore and I don&#8217;t want to get kicked in the balls again, so I&#8217;ll have to weaken you up and take you downstairs myself,� he said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please don&#8217;t,� I cried.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Shhh, it&#8217;ll only hurt for a minute. You shouldn&#8217;t have disobeyed me the first time if you didn&#8217;t want this to happen,� he said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Say when,� he ordered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I didn&#8217;t say anything as I watched his open hand rise into the air.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I said say when, bitch,� he said and slapped me across the face ruthlessly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You need to learn!� he barked and slapped me again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Every time you hesitate from now on, you will be punished!� 
He gave me another slap; one more and then a smooth caress. He pulled on my hair and tilted my head back, giving him enough space to bite down hard. Then he bite my shoulder, waiting for me to scream before stopping. I twisted and turned as he continued to bite my neck. It was finally over and he stopped to look me over. 
�I&#8217;m going to pick you up and carry you downstairs; if you try anything I will throw you down and kick the shit out of you. Do you understand?� he said
�Yes,� I managed to say. 
He scooped me up and carried me downstairs. I thought about making one last attempt, but he had worn me out. As we got to the bottom he dropped me and I fell to my knees, catching myself with my hands before my face hit the ground.
�Good girl, now stay on all fours,� he said.
I stared at the ground as he walked over to the spot where I had hit his face with the paddle and picked it up.
�Ah, great choice,� he laughed as he carried it over to where I was kneeling.
�Every time I hit you with this thing you are going to thank me. You are going to say &#8216;thank you sir&#8217;,� he ordered.
The first hit was on my butt, it wasn&#8217;t painful, just surprising. He continued to hit me on my butt, thighs and back until I could barely say &#8216;thank you sir&#8217; without crying. 
�That&#8217;s you&#8217;re punishment for trying to escape today, but you still have one left over from yesterday,� he said.
I cringed. I had almost forgotten, or hoped that he had forgotten.
�Please, don&#8217;t do it. Save it for later. I&#8217;ve had enough,� I said.
�You haven&#8217;t had enough if you are still talking back to me,� he said and kicked me.
 I fell over to my side.
�Take off those clothes; they don&#8217;t belong to you anymore. If you ever wear clothes again; it is because I let you, not because you wanted to,� he said.
 I slid off all of my clothes and curled up into a ball on the floor. 
He kicked them away and stood over me, probably contemplating what he was going to do next. 
�Do you need to use the bathroom?� he asked.
I was surprised at his change of heart.
�Yes,� I said.
He led me to the bathroom which was a small room on the other side of the stairs. It had a toilet and sink with a small closet built into the wall to hold towels. I sat down on the toilet as he watched.
�Open up your legs, I want to see you pee,� he said.
I hesitantly opened up my legs and tried to pee, but I was nervous and he was standing just above me, waiting.
�I can&#8217;t do it, I&#8217;m bladder shy,� I admitted.
�So you&#8217;d rather just not go to the bathroom then? Who knows the next time you&#8217;ll be able to go,� he warned.
�I&#8217;m trying!�
I pushed on my bladder until it hurt and a little trickle came out.
�Can I just close my legs, it might help,� I asked.
�No! I ordered you to keep your legs open,� he hissed.
I finally managed to push through and my urine came rushing. I finished and he led me out of the bathroom. 
�Go sit down on the bed,� he ordered as he started rummaging through his boxes. I sat in the center of the bed on the edge. 
�Perfect. Now lay down with your back on the mattress and your feet still touching the ground.�
I did as he ordered. He tied my wrists to the ends of bed frame. He opened up my mouth with his fingers and pushed a penis shaped gag into my mouth. It was about 6 inches and ran down my throat; I tried not to gag and avoided breathing through my mouth. It strapped above and below my ears, buckling in the back. He spread my legs as wide as they&#8217;d go, until they were aching from the pull and tied them to either end of the bed. Since the bed was sitting parallel length wise to the wall, all of this was a strange arrangement. 
�Now, you&#8217;ve been a terrible girl and the only reason you&#8217;re listening to me now is because you are afraid of me, not because you actually want please me. That&#8217;s alright though, this whole process starts from fear, but you&#8217;ll learn soon enough.�
I started at the ceiling while a pool of drool collecting around my gag. He dropped his pants and tore into me, pumping his dick in and out violently. In a moment he was disappointed by how passively I was taking all of it; trying to disappear. He slapped my tits until I started to squeal, trying to pull away from the pain; then, he got back to work pounding me. I tried to think of something else besides being raped, but I was too tired to avoid him. He finally pulled out and came all over my face. I tried to turn my face and wipe it off, but the gunk in the center of my face wouldn&#8217;t reach the mattress. 
�Did I tell you to wipe that cum off your face?� he asked softly.
I just stared at him. I didn&#8217;t want to play along anymore. I would just lay and take the bullshit. Eventually he would get bored. He would get a reaction out of me anymore. Timothy grabbed my face when I didn&#8217;t reply with a gesture.
�I&#8217;m going to have to keep punishing you; you&#8217;re doing this to yourself,� he said.
He walked away and came back with a whip.
�Twenty lashes for disobeying,� he said and started hitting me across my breasts.
He ran the whip up and down my stomach and breasts; letting the lash wrap around and leave a red streak. I thrashed back and forth trying to stop all of the pain, but it only got worse. I counted the strokes in my head, waiting for the end.
�There, there. It&#8217;s all over for now. Don&#8217;t cry; you&#8217;ll just have to be better next time,� he said and rubbed my raw breasts with his hands. 
I was sweating and tear covered by the time he was done lashing me. My stomach and sensitive breasts were burning. 
�I&#8217;m going to untie your feet, but don&#8217;t you dare try to kick me,� he warned.
I wasn&#8217;t planning on it. If I was going to try to escape, today wasn&#8217;t the day. He untied them and pressed them over and above my head. The bed had a frame of a day bed with the frame behind me being a little higher than the two on the sides and it arched over to give the appearance of a couch. Once he pulled my legs above my head he tied them to the frame and left about a foot of space between the two legs. My ass and vag were completely exposed and he pushed his finger in and out of my ass a couple times and it took them out.
�I&#8217;m going to stretch out your ass a little; I want to make sure that it&#8217;s available for my use at any time and that my dick can actually fit in it,� he said.
He started pushing a hard, thick object into my butthole.
�Relax your ass. Stop squeezing it; it&#8217;ll only hurt more if you do. One way or another I&#8217;m getting this butt plug in there,� he said.
I tried to release all the tension in my ass as he continued pushing. Finally, the plug went through the ring of my ass and sunk in deep. He pushed it in all the way, until it met the wide end of the plug. I felt his cold fingers spread open my pussy lips and start pushing in another tool. I moaned from all of the pressure. I had never had my ass and vag penetrated at the same time. It was very not pleasurable. He pushed in the huge vibrator and turned it on.
�Here&#8217;s the deal; you&#8217;re probably thinking to yourself that you&#8217;re in no mood to be sexually turned on, but your wet pussy tells me a different story. I want to help, but I simply can&#8217;t. You&#8217;re a slave and you&#8217;re not allowed to cum, period. This vibrator is motion censored; if your pussy moves its muscles voluntarily or not it will record it with a beep. When you&#8217;re done with your punishment, if there&#8217;s one beep you&#8217;ll get ten spankings, if two beeps you&#8217;ll get twenty and so on. So watch out and try not to move around too much or, well, have an orgasm,� he warned and walked away.
