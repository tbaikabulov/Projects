Synopsis: Caroline meets her future Beau at a networking party.  Her interest is peaked by a curious business card.  She discovers her submisive nature, and this leads to matrimony.
By: B.Z. 
Caroline Hauptman was an up and coming lawyer with a prestigious Boston Law
  firm. She had everything; money, looks and brains; an attractive 5'6&quot; thirty-something
  brunette with 34D, 26, 36 measurements. Many of her male cohorts would have
  loved seeing Caroline modeling swimwear for Sports Illustrated. 
Her law firm sponsored many networking parties, which as a Junior Partner
  Caroline was required to attend. The main purpose of these &quot;get-togethers&quot; was
  to entertain current clients and to recruit new ones. It was at one of these
  events that Caroline met Rupert Sedgwick. 
Her first impression of Rupert had been that he reminded her of the Higgins
  character in the T.V. series Magnum P.I. He was short, portly, balding and
  very, very British. 
When they exchanged business cards she smirked, raised one eyebrow, and then
  felt the warmth in her cheeks as they blushed a rosy red. The card was elegant
  enough, but in place of the usual company logo this card had been embossed
  with a set of silver handcuffs entwined with a thorny red rose and on the back
  of the card she found a hand written message &quot;YOU MY DEAR, would look
  divine in a collar and cuffs&quot;. 
A week later Caroline' cheeks again had the occasion to glow red when Henry
  Frisbain, her boss, reintroduced Rupert to her as a new client, as Henry informed
  her that; �Mr. Sedgwick has expressly asked for you to represent him.� 
Ironically Rupert's little comment on the back of his business card had somehow
  planted a seed in Caroline's mind, and in fact she felt as though she had begun
  to obsess about it. 
She'd had no experience with bondage as an adult, but that night after meeting
  Rupert her memory had suddenly flashed back to images of being bound; she remembered
  seeing a few old black and white movies of herself as a child being tied up
  by her older brother Robert and their cousin Jason. Somehow she had always
  wound up being the victim of the older boys as they played cowboys and Indians
  or cops and robbers. She remembered that her family had thought it was kind
  of cute as they filmed the scenes created by the older boys. She smiled to
  herself at the memory, but the smile faded as another image leapt into her
  brain. 
A deeply suppressed memory jolted her, she remembered being tied up as a teenager
  in her skimpy cheerleaders uniform, again by Robert and Jason but this time
  it was a different kind of play, now the boys (older) began to grope at her
  bound and burgeoning young breasts as they lifted her skirt to gain a peek
  at her still hairless and virginal pussy. She vaguely remembered that her initial
  reaction had been one of anger, but as the boys' hands freely roved over her
  body she could remember feeling something else, something different. She remembered
  a tingly sensation that crept down her spine and settled in a place she hadn't
  expected. It was a new experience for her. 
The boys had refused to release her until they had coerced her into promising
  not to tell their parents, and in fact she had somehow managed to completely
  block the event from her memory, until now. 
Still she had never associated bondage (she hadn't even realized she knew
  the term) with sex. In fact, those childhood memories had been filed somewhere
  deep in the recesses of her mind. But now she thought about them much more
  than she had consciously wanted to, and that strange tingly feeling she remembered
  was her upper most thought. 
Like most junior partners in large Law firms Caroline was over worked and
  under sexed. Outside the firm she had little time for a social life, let alone
  a sexual one. So Rupert's little notation had set her mind on a course she
  had seldom traveled. Awakening an interest in her that she couldn't as yet
  understand nor could she displace it. 
Rupert Sedgwick on the other hand was an older man in his early fifties, but
  not by any means ancient. He was an affluent member of the British gentry.
  He loved classical music, fine art, gourmet cooking and dining, a good smoke
  and above all else a beautiful woman on his arm. He was charismatic and domineering;
  in his business affairs he was a little martinet who did not abide with the
  inefficiencies of others. And now he had set his sights on Caroline. 
During their meetings Rupert was all business and he found Caroline to be
  exceptionally proficient at her job. But when their business had concluded
  Rupert would persistently ask the same question. �Have you thought about my
  little message on the back of my business card?� When she would either try
  to ignore the question or too quickly answer no, he always felt that she was
  probably either in denial or lying, but being a patient gentleman he never
  pressed the issue. 
Over the next year the seed planted and nurtured by Rupert had taken root
  and flourished in Caroline's mind. 
But Caroline, fearful of committing to a real bondage relationship, tried
  experimenting on her own. 
First she had tried tying herself up as best she could, without finding much
  satisfaction in just being loosely bound. She'd even succeeded in persuading
  one of her girlfriends into tying her up once. This had produced more secure
  bonds, but again little gratification. Desperately she'd even attempted to
  get Bob, her sometimes boyfriend to take an interest in tying her up and taking
  advantage of her, but he displayed little talent for and even less interest
  in the game. Finally and grudgingly she had to admit to herself, that if she
  wanted to sate this obsession of hers she would need to find some one who knew
  what the hell it was that they were doing. 
All during this time she'd had regular monthly meetings with Rupert concerning
  business. The tone of these meetings was always very professional. But Rupert,
  persistent to the end, never failed to ask her about the little message he
  had scribbled on the back of his business card during that networking party. 
It was a game that Caroline had accepted as part of Rupert's personality,
  but she had never seriously considered giving a positive response to these
  inquiries. And then the thought occurred to her that perhaps it was Rupert's
  persistent reminders that had perpetuated this infatuation of hers. 
In the end Caroline's curiosity and frustration finally won out over her better
  judgment and at their next meeting, when Rupert invariably asked her about
  the statement on the back of his business card. Caroline averted her eyes screwed
  up her courage and said, �Yes, Rupert I have. I think you know I have, and
  I think you now know that I want you to show me exactly what it feels like.� 
�Delighted my dear, and may I say, it's about time.� 
Without saying another word he promptly reached inside his jacket removed
  a sealed envelope. Handing it to her, he turned and walked out. The envelope
  contained a list of detailed instructions for their first meeting outside the
  confines of her office. 
Caroline taken unawares by Rupert's preparedness and arrogance, thought to
  herself, �Why you smug little bastard, I ought to tear this thing up and throw
  it in the trash can.� But, her resolve quickly melted and she reflected as
  she opened the packet; �he has probably been carrying this envelope with him
  ever since our first meeting, and the arrogance, well that was after all his
  personality.� 
Now alone in her office she read the contents of the envelope. The detailed
  instructions were typically Rupert; she was to arrive at precisely 7:00 that
  evening. She was to wear a cocktail dress that did not come down below her
  knees. She was forbidden to wear panties or pantyhose; but she was to wear
  a garter belt with hose and the highest heeled shoes that she owned. 
Caroline arrived at Rupert's apartment complex at 6:30. Feeling more nervous
  than she had been on her very first date, and fearing being late she sat in
  the lobby and waited for the appointed hour. And, as the hour slowly approached
  she looked anxiously at her wristwatch before knocking on Rupert's door at
  precisely 7:00. 
Entering the apartment Rupert complimented Caroline on her punctuality. As
  he escorted her in he collected her coat and purse then retrieved a pair of
  silver handcuffs from his jacket pocket. &quot;I believe these to be the reason
  that you have finally accepted my hospitality.&quot; With that he drew her
  arms behind her and securely cuffed her wrists behind her back. 
&quot;I must say, you do look lovely my dear&quot; Rupert said as he inspected
  his nervous guest. 
Meanwhile, Caroline stood rigidly still, not quite sure of her balance without
  the use of her arms . She was attired in a chocolate colored strapless dress
  with a beaded top. The color of her dress matched the color of her eyes and
  the color of the flowing locks of hair that draped her naked shoulders, as
  it clung seductively to her luscious form. Her legs were sheathed in taupe
  colored silk stockings and she was perched exquisitely upon a pair of chocolate
  suede pumps with a t-strap and 4&quot; heels. 
Taking a riding crop conveniently at hand from a nearby table, Rupert carefully
  raised Caroline's skirt to ensure that she had followed all of his instructions.
  Lowering it again he commented, &quot;Excellent my dear, you follow directions
  quite well&quot;. He took her by the elbow and led her to a comfortable looking
  chair and had her sit down. 
He then asked if she would like a glass of white wine. She indicated that
  she would, but shrugged her shoulders and indicated her wrists. 
Rupert smiled as he opened a bottle of chardonnay. He filled the glass half
  way then set it upon a table next to Caroline's chair. He held the glass by
  its stem and expertly swirled it on the table, he then raised the glass to
  Caroline's nose, &quot;it has a very pleasant aroma, don't you think so?&quot; Caroline
  sniffed the wine and agreed. Then Rupert lowered the wine glass to her mouth
  and gave her a sip. 
Dinner was quite a different experience for Caroline. After their glass of
  wine Rupert, took her again by the elbow, led her to the dining room table.
  But instead of offering her a chair he directed her kneel down next to his. 
While Rupert dined on trout almandine, white asparagus, and light saffron
  rice Caroline knelt by his side. He would offer her bits from his plate, which
  he gave to her by hand. She accepted these offerings and licked his fingers
  as he directed, but her enjoyment of the evening had ceased. 
Sitting in the comfortable chair and having Rupert fawn over her with the
  glass of wine, that was exciting, but having to kneel at his side while he
  stuffed himself and be fed her scraps of food from the table like a dog that
  was just plain humiliating. 
After dinner Rupert produced what at first glance appeared to be an elegant
  golden chain, too heavy to be a necklace for a pendant but elegant enough to
  be worn as a choker. And as it turned out, it was in fact a choker. A 24 karat
  gold dog's choke collar; which Rupert wasted no time in fitting it over Caroline's
  head. With the collar settled about her neck he then snapped a golden leash
  to the collar's ring. A quick jerk on the leash forced the collar to constrict
  tightly around Caroline's pretty neck. She gasped and felt a chill ran down
  her spine as her air supply was briefly cut off. 
Caroline could feel the goose bumps rushing down her spine as the collar engulfed
  her neck, and for the first time she could also feel that strange tingling
  sensation she had vaguely remembered down below where her panties should have
  been. 
Rupert helped Caroline to her feet, and then led her by her leash into his
  den. And again she was ordered down on her knees. She would have to kneel at
  his feet as he indulged his after dinner custom of a snifter of Courvoisier
  Napoleon accompanied by a fine Cohiba Churchill. 
As he consumed the cognac and puffed away on the cigar, he would occasionally
  pat Caroline's head as if she were a favorite pet. And dipping his finger into
  the cognac he would give her an occasional taste of the strong spirits. 
Caroline, however, began to think that she had made a big mistake, sure there
  was that sudden surge of excitement when Rupert had placed the collar around
  her neck. And then when he had tugged on the leash she briefly panicked with
  excitement as it cut off her air supply for an instant. But this whole kneeling
  thing was going nowhere. 
It was obvious to her that Rupert was enjoying the evening and she gratefully
  accepted the occasional taste of the cognac; but she really detested the odor
  of the cigar, and yet something compelled her to say nothing and let the evening
  play itself out, still hoping things would soon improve. 
With his after dinner ritual completed, Rupert finally led her into the bedroom. 
�Now maybe things will get a little interesting,� Caroline hoped. 
As she stood next to the bed Rupert maneuvered behind her and unzipped her
  gown then removed her bra letting the two articles of clothing drop to the
  floor. He ordered her to step out the garments, which now gathered around her
  ankles. Next he ordered her to slip off her shoes. Then leaving her garments
  piled on the floor he ordered her up onto the bed. 
Rupert produced two sets of silver ankle cuffs and secured each of her gorgeously
  petit ankles to opposite sides of the bed's footboard, then releasing her wrists
  from behind her back, he pulled her arms up over her head and fastened first
  one wrist using the same silver handcuffs he had just removed to one side of
  the headboard, and then with an identical pair which magically appeared from
  his jacket pocket he fastened her other wrist to the opposite side of the headboard. 
Caroline now felt quite helpless; the goose bumps soon returned, as did the
  tingling sensation, which began to emanate from within the area covered by
  her triangular growth of hair. 
�Okay Rupert, this is more like it.� Caroline thought. 
Rupert now had Caroline spread-eagled on the bed and dressed only in her garter
  belt and silk stockings. From the table next to the bed he removed a white
  leather covered ring gag, which he gently forced into her mouth and fastened
  behind her neck. From the same drawer he removed two gloves; one looked like
  a furry oven mitt, and was in fact made of mink. The other was a black leather
  glove that had dozens of small steel tacks protruding from its' palm. 
Rupert placed the mink mitten on his right hand and the leather glove on his
  left, and then attacked her body with the mink. He ran his hand over Caroline's
  body from head to toe, focusing his attention mostly on her torso (bosoms,
  pelvis and waist) and her inner thighs. 
�Yes Rupert that's what I've been longing for.� Caroline thought to herself
  as she tested the security of her wrists and ankles. 
Rupert maneuvered the glove expertly over her taut body. And Caroline became
  more and more excited. When he lingered a while over her already quite excited
  clit, she went absolutely wild trying to grind her hips in rhythm with the
  passage of the glove. 
Caroline was panting, �Yes, yes, yes.� 
Suddenly, the mink mitt was gone. 
�No, no please don't stop.� Came Caroline's garbled plea as she moaned through
  the gag. 
But Rupert paid no attention to her pleas and without warning he switched
  from the sensual mink mitten to the cruel leather glove; and instead of an
  arousing massage Caroline was about to experience some painful reality. 
Instantly his gloved left hand seized upon Caroline's right breast, 
Caroline quickly shifted from ecstasy to agony in the same instant. 
�Aaaaaaaaarrrrgghhhh.� As little trickles of blood formed on the assaulted
  boob Caroline let out a blood-curdling scream that the ring gag, or any gag
  for that matter, was powerless to suppress. 
Then his left hand grabbed her crotch, leading to another blood-curdling scream
  from Caroline. He continued to explore her body with the devilish glove running
  it along her body as she squirmed trying to avoid its agonizing touch or its'
  sudden grabbing of a handful of flesh. 
As Rupert maneuvered about her body Caroline continued to scream insanely
  through the gag. 
Suddenly Rupert switched back to the mink mitten. When the pain subsided Caroline
  slowly calmed down. Then as the sensual mitt journeyed over her torso she once
  again found herself moving to the rhythm of his touch. 
But this was not her game to play; Rupert was in full control. His plan was
  to bring her to the very edge of ecstasy and then to bring her back down again
  and again. So he watched as his captive slowly neared reaching orgasm, and
  then with speed of a viper he suddenly grabbed her left breast with his tormenting
  left hand. 
�Aaagh, no, no, no not now I'm so close.� Caroline wept. 
But Rupert's plans did not include satisfaction for Caroline, at least not
  any time soon. He would alternate between the mink mitten and leather glove
  at his leisure. The mink glove would bring her closer and closer to the edge
  of orgasm. And then the tacky little leather glove would send chills up and
  down her spine, inflicting the kind of pain she'd never expected nor experienced
  before, the sort of pain that made her skin crawl and her cunt lips tingle. 
Rupert continued to toy with her for well over two hours before deciding to
  allow her the reward she now so desperately craved. He wanted the devilish
  left hand to finally bring her satisfaction. So he gently began to rub her
  cunt with the thorny gloved hand. 
Rupert's gentle touch combined with the raspy feel of the glove was something
  new and strange. But before Caroline could adjust to this new sensation he
  shifted his focused onto her excited little clit, he gently played with it.
  Lightly squeezing her excited little nubbin between the tacky thumb and index
  finger of his left hand, and gently prodding it gently with his middle finger. 
Caroline gyrated in time with Rupert's touch, as her vulva sought contact
  with its' attacker. 
His gentle play continued until he could see she was about to cum. This time
  he allowed her to cum all the way. And as she reached her climax he suddenly
  left her clit and roughly grasped her inner right thigh with his deadly left
  hand. The pain and ecstasy combined as Caroline exploded into one massive orgasm
  after another. 
This was brand new ground for Caroline; she had never experienced anything
  like that in her life. And secured to the bed as she was she could do nothing
  but lay there helplessly, panting exhaustedly as a broad satisfied grin spread
  rapidly across her rosy flushed face. 
Caroline may have been ready to call it a night, but Rupert was just getting
  started, he now decided to intensify the pain. As he felt she was ready to
  be introduced to the lash. He removed a small taws and a blindfold from the
  bedside table. He positioned the blindfold over her eyes, then slowly and gently
  he began to caress Caroline's exposed body with the taws. Gradually he allowed
  her to become accustomed to the feel of the taws lapping at her body. 
Caroline was exhausted after her multiple orgasms, and she had expected Rupert
  would either release her from her bondage letting her go home or maybe, even
  better, make mad passionate love to her. But as the blindfold covered her eyes
  she wondered, �What can he be up to now.� Then she felt the taws. 
At first the light slapping of the taws against her bare skin felt good, almost
  ticklish. But as the strokes intensified they began to sting more and more. 
Rupert expertly continued to increase the power of his strokes until he was
  able to exert more force behind each blow. 
Caroline's moans and giggles gradually reverted to groans of pain. But strangely
  she found that the pain was not that hard to accept, and then there was that
  growing tingly feeling again as she felt her clit coming back to attention
  once again. Slowly as Rupert's stokes intensified her heaving chest, taut stomach
  and tingling pubis began to glow as they turned a light shade of red, like
  mild sunburn. 
After inflicting as much pain as he thought she could endure for her first
  time, Rupert returned to the gloves. Her skin was now very sensitive and even
  the lightest touch of his gloved hand brought about violent reactions from
  his unsighted victim. And even the soft bristles of the mink mitten would elicit
  little jerky movements from her sensitive breasts and abdomen. 
In fact, her body was so sensitive to the touch that she experienced sensations
  she had never dreamed existed. As she became accustomed to the mink he began
  to massage her clitoris with his now bare left hand. 
But just as before, as she neared orgasm he would bring her back down by reintroducing
  the taws into the action. Rupert regaled in his efforts; relentlessly toying
  with his helpless victim, bringing her to the edge of orgasm only to bring
  her back down through the stinging attention of the taws. 
He managed to keep her on edge for another two hours. And only after many
  repetitions of the pain pleasure cycle did he finally think she was ready for
  the coup de main. 
First he removed her blindfold then he removed his hand from her cunt and
  replaced it with his 8&quot; long 4&quot; around cock. Caroline seeing the
  size of his cock thought, �Oh my god, Rupert you devil.� 
She was amazed at how easily the huge thing had been able to penetrate her
  cunt. She hadn't realized just how well lubricated she'd become. Rupert attacked
  his target with vigor and before too long they both exploded simultaneously.
  For Caroline it turned out to be more exciting and a more extensive series
  of orgasms than she'd ever thought she'd be capable of. 
Rupert retrieved a crystal dildo that approximated the size of his cock from
  the bedside table. He then alternated between the dildo and his cock, giving
  his dick an occasional break, and continued to ravish Caroline well into the
  night. 
When he had completely satisfied himself, and without removing the ring gag
  he positioned himself over her head and placed his now flaccid member in her
  mouth, ordering her to clean him off. 
Caroline used her tongue to lick his cock and balls clean. But this attention
  brought his docile prick back to attention, and ejaculated a fresh load of
  cum into her gaping mouth. Caroline nearly gagged trying to swallow the unexpected
  gift. 
When she had finally finished with her task, Rupert unfastened her from the
  bed. Then taking the leash in hand he coached the exhausted girl from his bed.
  He again cuffed her wrists behind her back, and still leaving the gag in her
  mouth he secured her leash to the bedpost at the foot of his bed. Caroline
  was given a pillow for her head as he told her she would spend the night on
  the floor tied to the bed. 
Too tired to complain and despite the discomfort of the floor Caroline curled
  up into a ball and soon fell into a sound sleep. 
When she awoke, she was alone in the bedroom. The handcuffs and the gag had
  been removed, but she was still tethered to the bedpost. She found her clothes
  and a towel neatly folded on the bed. A note from Rupert instructed her, �You
  must leave the collar in place, but you may unfasten your leash. The bathroom
  is through the door on your left. Shower and get yourself cleaned up. The kitchen
  is down the hall to your right, there will be breakfast when you are ready.� 
After showering and dressing Caroline proceeded to the kitchen where she found
  fresh coffee, French toast and sausage awaiting her. There was also another
  note from Rupert. 
The note read: &quot;Caroline, if you enjoyed last night as much as I did,
  then keep the collar about your neck, do not remove it. Return tonight at precisely
  6:00 P.M. Your attire has the same restrictions as last night (a change of
  gown is quite permissible) but in addition you must wear the collar. When you
  arrive at my door knock three times then kneel in front of the door, head bowed
  and hands behind your back. If you choose not to return then keep the collar
  as a small token of our night together.&quot; 
A famished Caroline read and reread the note as she devoured the breakfast
  set before her. Her body ached and she had pinpricks and scratches all over
  her torso and inner thighs, but nothing clothing wouldn't cover up. �Yes, heaven
  forgive me, once we got to the bedroom I probably did enjoy it just as much
  if not more than you did, you arrogant little bastard.� Then she hurried home
  so that she could get ready for work. 
Once at work her tattered body would not allow her sit comfortably at her
  desk. Unable to focus on work, Caroline spent her day uncomfortably fidgeting
  in her chair while she nervously fingered the gold collar that hung around
  her neck pondering what to do. She knew that Rupert had provided her with a
  way to walk away from the whole scene. 
She had hoped that the experience would be a �one and done�. That it would
  satisfy a brief obsession and she'd be over it. But instead the experience
  had acted like an opiate causing a craving for more. 
She also knew that this thing was suddenly moving very fast, maybe too fast,
  and that acceptance of his invitation implied a commitment on her part. And
  she just didn't know whether or not she was prepared for that. 
Until last night Caroline had no clue as to the extent of her submissive and
  masochistic nature. Nor did she know how just much she would enjoy it. 
But by 5:30 P.M. there she sat, in the lobby of Rupert's building. The collar
  resting on her shoulders, having never been removed. 
She was dressed, as required, in a black scoop necked cocktail dress with
  an open back and a slight A-line shape. Ebony silk covered her legs; which
  rested upon black double-band suede sling backs with 4� heels. As once again
  she found herself anxiously killing time, nervously waiting for the appointed
  hour for her arrival at Rupert's door. 
As her watch ticked down to 6:00 Caroline knocked on Rupert's door three times,
  then she dropped to her knees, lowered her head and placed her hands behind
  her back. 
Rupert took his time in answering the door. 
Once in the apartment he again collected her coat and purse and then cuffed
  Caroline's wrists behind her back and directed her to the same chair she had
  sat in the night before. 
&quot;I see by your compliance with my instructions that you wish to continue
  our relationship. So I feel compelled to go over some ground rules before we
  embark on our evenings entertainment.&quot; 
While Caroline relaxed in the chair, Rupert opened a bottle of wine. They
  shared a glass while Rupert set down his rules: &quot;First rule, tomorrow
  you will move in here with me. Second, you will get rid of all pantyhose, slacks
  and any skirts that come down below your knees that you now own. Third, you
  may continue to work if you so choose, in fact I would encourage you to do
  so, you are an excellent lawyer my dear. Forth, if you do choose to remain
  at your job, you will have to check with me first before working any extra
  hours. You will be given every opportunity to succeed at your job. But once
  your workday is over your time belongs to me. Fifth, you will obey, without
  hesitation, my every command. Failure to comply will be met with severely.
  And lastly, now that you know what my rules are I will expect you to gave me
  a definitive answer as to whether you accept these terms or not by the end
  of this evening. If you accept we will get you moved in here by tomorrow night.
  If you choose not to accept them, then we will never see each other again,
  in any capacity.&quot; 
Rupert then left Caroline for a moment and returned with a black velvet cloak.
  He ordered Caroline to stand then wrapped her in the cloak. He explained that
  they would be dining out. Suddenly realizing he intended to take her out in
  public with her hands cuffed behind her back Caroline started to object. 
Rupert immediately grabbed the ring of Caroline's collar, as the collar constricted
  on her pretty neck her protests were cut off. He was quick to tell her &quot;Remember
  rule number five, you will obey without question or hesitation or you will
  be punished. Now my dear, you may cooperate freely or I can attach the leash
  and gag you. But one way or another we are going out.&quot; She quickly decided
  it was best to cooperate. 
Rupert had made reservations at one of his favorite restaurants. He had arranged
  for them to be seated at a booth in one of the darker corners of the dining
  room. With the cloak wrapped about her Caroline did not feel all that self-conscience.
  But once seated at the table the cloak was removed and she began to get nervous
  again. Since they were in a booth Rupert was able to sit very close to her,
  this permitted him to play with her and to feed her without drawing too much
  attention. 
One very curious young lad seemed to be fascinated as he watched the older
  gentleman cutting up the food on a plate and then feeding it to the very attractive
  woman who sat beside him just like his mother did for his little sister. But
  other patrons of the restaurant seemed not to notice. 
From the restaurant they went to the art museum to see the Van Gogh exhibit &quot;Face
  to Face&quot;. While in the museum Caroline was allowed to retain her velvet
  cloak. No one could see her handcuffs, but she still attracted a few stares
  as Rupert forcefully guided her every move. 
After the museum they returned to Rupert's apartment. Rupert removed the cloak
  and unlocked the handcuffs. He then ordered her to get undressed. While Caroline
  was disrobing, Rupert retrieved a gym bag from his bedroom. 
Returning from the bedroom he drew the leash from his pocket and connected
  it to Caroline's collar and lead her into the den. He proceeded to the leather-upholstered
  sofa and had her sit down legs together. 
He began removing ropes from the bag. First he folded one rope in half and
  passed the ends through the loop at the center. He drew the rope over her feet
  and cinched it about her ankles, he wrapped the rope several times around her
  ankles, separated the ends then passed them between her legs cinching them
  several times before he knotted the rope at the back. 
Caroline moaned softly as Rupert tied two more ropes, one above the knees
  and one below in the same manner as her ankles. He helped her to her feet then
  sat down on the sofa. With Caroline's back to him he pulled her arms behind
  her and with her hands, palm to palm, he wrapped the rope around her wrists
  in the same way that he had her legs. Her elbows were next as they received
  the same treatment, being drawn as close as physically possible. 
Rupert stood and faced her as the next rope was cinched around Caroline's
  waist then drawn up between her legs, and left to dangle, temporarily, down
  the back of her legs like a limp tail. The rope that passed through her crotch
  had two strategically placed knots, one rested on her excited little clit and
  the other pressed tensely upon her anus. 
Now before adding the finishing touches to her tie, Rupert drew Caroline across
  his lap and with his bare hand brought a rosy red color to her bare behind.
  He then positioned her face down on the sofa. The rope that had trailed down
  her legs was now drawn taut forcing the knot tightly against clit and anus
  then secured to the rope about her waist; another rope drew her ankles tightly
  to her wrists securing her in a severe hog tie. 
Rupert returned to the gym bag and produced a pair of women's bikini briefs.
  Caroline saw them, just before Rupert stuffed them into her mouth; she recognized
  them as being a pair of her own. She wondered how he could have possibly acquired
  them. The panties were then secured in place with a red silk scarf. 
�It didn't seem as though you enjoyed kneeling by side last night, so we'll
  she how much you enjoy this position.� 
Caroline spent the next hour and a half staring at the arm of the sofa and
  struggling in her bondage, and with each movement she made she was reminded
  of the presence of those two strategically placed knots on the rope running
  between her thighs. 
Rupert simply relaxed in his overstuffed leather armchair sipping his Courvoisier,
  smoking his cigar and thoroughly enjoying the show. 
After quietly enjoying his nightly indulgence of spirit and smoke Rupert returned
  his attention to Caroline. He unfastened her hog tie and released her arms
  from bondage. Leather cuffs replaced the ropes on each of her rope burned wrists.
  He carried her to a corner of the room and set her down on her bound legs facing
  the wall. Rupert securely padlocked Caroline's wrist cuffs to the rings set
  well above her head in the wall. Having secured her to the wall he released
  the bondage about her legs, again replacing the ropes with leather cuffs about
  each of her shapely ankles. He then padlocked her ankles to the rings set near
  to the floor. 
Rupert now took a very serious tone with Caroline. &quot;You resisted when
  you were told of my dinner plans, that has earned you ten good stokes of the
  cane.&quot; With tearful eyes she submissively nodded her agreement. The omnipresent
  gym bag provided a thin bamboo cane that would leave nice red welts on her
  bottom. He ordered her to count the strokes, and then took aim at the crease
  just below her rump. After a few light taps he brought the cane down hard on
  the back of her thighs. He could hear the wind rush from lungs then a very
  weak �one� issued from her mouth. 
�Very good my dear, a little louder please.� 
Rupert proceeded and each time the cane found its mark Caroline reported in
  a muffled count, but as loudly as she could until finally she had ten parallel
  stripes on her thighs and round bottom. 
As Caroline sobbed uncontrollably, Rupert cupped the aching globes of her
  ass in his hands. He squeezed them like a couple of ripe melons then gave each
  cheek a gentle pat. 
After releasing Caroline from the rings in the wall Rupert attached the leash
  and led her back into the bedroom. Then he had her lie down on the bed. The
  soreness of her derri&egrave;re  caused her to lie
  uncomfortably. 
Attaching ropes to her securely cuffed wrists he drew them down toward the
  foot of the bed securing them to opposite sides of the footboard. Then he attached
  ropes to the �D� rings on her ankle cuffs and forced her legs up toward the
  headboard. Caroline soon found herself bent at the waist with her chin pressing
  into her chest and her delectable derri&egrave;re raised up from the bed as
  he securely tied her ankles at opposite sides of the headboard. 
Rupert ran Caroline through the gauntlet of pleasure and pain as the mink
  mitten and the taws were returned to duty. But this time Caroline's cute little
  rosy sphincter was the object of Rupert's attack. Fear ran through her mind
  as she felt his at her rear door. She wanted to yell. �No, no not there, I've
  never had sex there, please Rupert don't.� But the sting of the cane was still
  fresh in her mind, and so she withheld her protest, and when he replaced his
  finger with his cock, and penetration suddenly occurred she merely sobbed passively. 
Despite the unfamiliar and painful entrance into aching bottom, again Caroline's
  body exploded in orgasm after orgasm. Caroline was mystified; how could she
  could experience so much pleasure from so much pain? 
When Rupert's desires were sated he released her wrists and ankles from the
  bed then removed the gag from her mouth. He lay back on the bed and pointed
  at his cum coved penis. Caroline immediately got the idea and crawled over
  on her hands and knees and started to lick the precious fluid from his dick. 
Just as it had done the night before her attention to his dick made him hard
  once again, he smiled at her patted her on the head, then grabbing her head
  with both hands and forced her head down hard as he shot his load of cum deep
  down her throat. She nearly choked but managed to swallow most of it before
  completing the job of cleaning him off. 
Then Rupert removed a small jar from the bedside table and started to apply
  it's contents to Caroline's aching butt. The cream was cool and soothing, and
  soon the burning sensation eased. 
As he applied the ointment to ass he spoke to her. �Good girl, you are learning
  very fast my dear.� 
�You now know what is expected of you Caroline.� 
�Are you are still inclined to commit yourself to this type of treatment?� 
�I require your answer now.� 
�Shall we move you in here permanently, or shall we say goodbye?� 
�This decision is yours and yours alone my dear.&quot; 
As tears began to well up in her eyes Caroline gasped, &quot;Oh master, please,
  I don't think I fully understand it but I do want to stay.&quot; 
Rupert was very pleased and he was impressed that she had taken it upon herself
  to call him master. 
But he was still a cautious man, and in the morning legal papers would be
  signed. For now he would give her one last chance to recant. &quot;Okay Caroline
  you may stay, but understand that this is your decision and I am taking you
  at your word, any subsequent change of heart will be completely ignored. Do
  you understand this and still wish to stay?&quot; 
&quot;Yes master.&quot; She knelt and kissed his semi-erect dick. 
Rupert fixed the leash to her collar locked her cuffed wrists behind her back.
  Again he coached her from the bed tied her leash to the foot of his bed then
  tossed a pillow down to the floor. Caroline curled up on the floor, but found
  sleep evasive. She was too excited she couldn't help thinking about how she
  had been ravished by Rupert over those past two nights and she anticipated
  many more nights of the same. 
In the morning Rupert released Caroline's hands from behind her back. The
  collar and leather cuffs would now be permanent fixtures about her neck, wrists
  and ankles whenever she was with Rupert. When she had finished her toilette
  she joined Rupert at the breakfast table still naked. He again cuffed her hands
  behind her back before feeding her bacon and eggs. 
After breakfast Rupert laid out some legal papers before her. He'd had them
  prepared in anticipation of Caroline's agreeing to stay. Rupert released her
  hands as he presented her with a pen, Caroline looked over the papers and found
  them very precise and in order. As she signed them she thought, &quot;he really
  does think of everything.&quot; 
Caroline enjoyed Rupert's attention at the breakfast table, but she was about
  to find out that there were domestic duties attached to her sexual servitude. 
Rupert loved to cook but detested the cleaning up afterward, so from now on
  cleaning-up the kitchen and rest of the apartment would be the responsibility
  of Caroline. 
Much to Caroline's dismay Rupert still had a few surprises in store for her. 
He went to his bedroom and returned with a box that contained Caroline's &quot;work
  clothes&quot;. 
He began by placing a black rubber corset around her waist cinching her 26&quot; waist
  to a trimmer 22 inches (she discovered that she now expected to wear a corset
  unless she was naked); over the corset he placed a starched white apron. After
  unlocking the cuffs from behind her back he handed her a pair of black silk
  stockings and told her to put them on. And then he gave her a pair of long
  black latex gloves and had her pull those on. 
He then ran a chain through the ring on her collar attaching the ends to her
  cuffs allowing her the movement of her hands, but prevented her from lowering
  them below her waist. A pair of black patent leather pumps with 6&quot; stiletto
  heels and straps that locked around her ankles completed the costume. 
Caroline struggled to maintain her balance on the awkward shoes, and was told
  that whenever she had work to do around the apartment she would have to do
  it in this attire. 
But before she would be set to her task of cleaning up in the kitchen Rupert
  had another surprise in store for her. He released the chain that connected
  her wrists to her neck and again attached the leash to her collar, and then
  he led her into the bathroom. 
Caroline saw that he had arranged an electric hair trimmer, shaving cream
  and a straight razor on a small table by the sink. A narrow leather covered
  bench was positioned in front of the sink. 
Rupert led her to the bench and ordered her to sit straddling the bench. He
  secured her ankle cuffs to rings set at the bottom of the bench's legs then
  had her lay back on the bench and fastened wrists cuffs to rings at the other
  end of the bench. Without a word he grabbed the trimmers and removed the longer
  hair from around her pussy. Then lathering her mound with shaving cream he
  reached for the straight razor. He expertly removed every trace of the thick
  curly brown hair that had covered her love mound. He rinsed away the remaining
  lather then patted her dry and lightly dusted her with talc. 
Finished he informed her: &quot; You will make shaving yourself a part of
  your morning toilette, failure to do this will be punished severely, and may
  lead to a permanent solution to the task.&quot; 
Caroline was then released from the bench and her chains reattached she was
  sent to the task of cleaning the kitchen. 
Encouraged by Rupert Caroline had decided to continue to work for her law
  firm. And as promised Rupert did not interfere with this, (at least not most
  of time, anyway). After all, he had his own business to run, and could think
  of no good reason why Caroline should languish about the apartment with little
  or nothing to do. 
Besides, it gave him an excuse to play around with little remote controlled
  toys that could keep Caroline on edge while she tried to concentrate on work. 
In fact, the only area of her job that Rupert did take an interest in was
  her wardrobe. For the office he insisted that she wear under her business suits
  or dresses which were allowed to have skirts no lower than the top of her knees
  a corset, of course, and shoes with no less than a 5&quot; heels. 
After work they established a regular routine, she would return to his apartment,
  knock three times on the door and kneel before the door, head bowed and hands
  behind her back. If Rupert did not open the door within three minutes she was
  allowed to use her key, but once inside she was required to strip down to her
  under garments place the leash on her collar and kneel by the door until Rupert
  arrived. 
As the relationship had progressed Caroline became increasingly subservient
  to Rupert, which increasingly endeared her to him. 
Rupert, who had never been one for monogamous relationships, soon realized
  that he had a real jewel in Caroline, and decided that marriage was a logical
  next step. The ceremony, however, would not be your garden-variety wedding
  affair. 
Caroline, of course, would have preferred a large church wedding, but the
  very nature of these nuptials prohibited that. Instead she would have to settle
  for a quiet civil ceremony performed by a judge. A judge, that just happened
  to be one of Rupert's closest friends. 
Rupert took care of all the arrangements, and thus the ceremony had a decidedly
  male and bondage aura to it. 
The week before the wedding, after her wedding trousseau had been assembled,
  and he'd had a new tux made, the excited couple went to see Dr. Klineholst.
  The good doctor, another friend of Rupert's, was going to provide Caroline
  with Rupert's wedding gift to her, thirteen gold rings. The rings were meant
  for her nose, nipples, navel and vaginal lips. 
Dr. Klineholst first pierced Caroline's septum and inserting a gold grommet
  that would later accept a gold ring that could be remove when Caroline was
  at work. Next he pierced each of her nipples inserting a gold ring, which was
  an exact duplicate of her wedding band, in each of them. He followed this up
  by piercing her navel, inserting another gold ring. He then proceeded to pierce
  each of her vaginal lips four times and inserting a gold ring about the size
  of a quarter in each piercing. The rings were evenly spaced from top to bottom.
  The final piercing and ring were applied to Caroline's excited little clit. 
For the wedding a white lace ribbon was threaded up from the bottom through
  each of her cunt rings and tied at the top with a bow that passed through the
  clit ring. 
Rupert, with a display of his usual efficiency, also had a gold chain made
  for when she would go back to work. It was sized to the exact length that would
  allowed it to be laced through the rings and locked shut by a small heart-shaped
  padlock tightly and securely closing her vagina to all intruders (his own version
  of a chastity belt). 
Caroline, of course, made a stunning bride as she knelt before the judge all
  in white. Directly above her beautifully laced up snatch her waist was cinched
  into a new white silk corset which was accented with pearls and drawn in to
  an incredible 19 inches, with a 24 karat gold belt securely locked around it's
  middle. Her gold chain collar rested just below a white lace choker, and the
  attached gold leash with its' white leather handle hung neatly down between
  her breasts. Her arms had been encased in a soft white leather binder. The
  binders' straps strategically criss-crossed between her breasts setting off
  those pert orbs, and each orb featured a gold ring dangling from an erect nipple.
  A gold chain passed through her crotch connecting the ring at the bottom end
  of the binder to the front of the gold belt that encased her waist. Her legs
  were sheathed in white silk stockings that had a series of small white pearls
  aligned down their seams at the back, and she was perched on a pair of white
  open toed pumps with 6&quot; heels. The ensemble was made complete by a large
  white ball gag with a white leather strap fastened at the back of her neck
  and concealed beneath a veil of white lace trimmed nylon. 
The ceremony was the conventional civil service version, until it came time
  for the vows, these affirmed Rupert's authority over Caroline and stressed
  Caroline's obedience to him. He of course answered when required, as Caroline
  had to nod her ascents. And like everything else Rupert planned the ceremony
  proceeded without a hitch. 
At the reception that followed Caroline remained gagged and restrained, although
  the veil had been removed. When the food was served Rupert graciously removed
  her gag and fed her by hand, as usual. But when the food was cleared away the
  gag was once again forced between her aching jaws. The male guests were offered
  Caroline's leash, and the opportunity to lead her around the dance floor. Most
  of the female guests were in a similar circumstance to Caroline's. 
After the reception Rupert lead Caroline to their bridal suite and carefully
  untied the lace ribbon from his wedding package. 
The happy couple is now in the tenth year of their committed love, and by
  all accounts, it would appear to be marital bliss. Caroline's law practice
  has blossomed and she is now a full partner in the firm, it seems her special
  marriage allows her to focus more clearly on her clients. As for Rupert, he
  still thinks of Caroline as a jewel worth keeping secured.
