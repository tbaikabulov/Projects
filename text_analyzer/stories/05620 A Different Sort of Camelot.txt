A Different
Sort of Camelot

&nbsp;

Morgan came to at the heavy sound
of footsteps approaching, the back of her head cracking painfully against a
stone wall.� Her eyes began to focus, the
sights about her none too encouraging.� She was in a dungeon, that
much was obvious from the sputtering torch, the dank windowless cell and the
realization that she was practically dangling nude from the ceiling.� Metal shackles encased her small wrists, and
were attached to a hook in the ceiling causing her to stand on tiptoe.� Despite the clearly dangerous situation she
was in, Morgan still couldn�t bring herself to believe it.� The last she remembered she had been
engrossed in screwing her paramour, Accolon, and
plotting the downfall of her moronic brother Arthur, and that doddering fool,
Merlin, the man who had helped Arthur�s father rape her mother.� Whoever
has betrayed me shall pay dearly, she thought. 

As her mind raced
to clear itself, the footsteps stopped outside, followed by the loud grating of
metal against stone and the entrance of two individuals.� �Well, old man, it seems you�ve kept your
word, you shall indeed have your reward.�

The figures emerged from the
darkness, �Arthur,� Morgan hissed, instinctively knowing the bent figure behind
to be Merlin.� Of course, who else, but, how?� 

�My dear sister,� Arthur said,
cupping her delicate face in his rough hand, then
tracing a line down her throat to knead her firm round breast, before finally
backhanding her with a loud, thwack, bringing a dribbling of blood to her full lips.� �It has been entirely too long.�� A wicked smile lit his strong handsome
features, and for a moment, Morgan saw the young king that she had loved beyond
all reason, despite the fact that the two shared a mother.� It had mattered not
a whit to Morgan; Arthur had burned with the fire of a young golden god.� He would free their people from the threat of
the Saxons and bring unity to the Britons under the old gods.� But, then Arthur had betrayed them, outlawed
the old ways, and banished Morgan in a guilty fit after their one night
together.� It would seem Arthur had not
forgotten that night anymore than she had though.� He took in the lovely sight of her petite
form strung taught before him, the thick black curls flowing to her waist, the
pearlescent skin, her green eyes that burned into him.� Even the blood on her lips seemed to enhance
her beauty.� He wanted to fit himself
perfectly to those curves, to meld with that white skin, to love her as he once
had.� But that was over now that she had
declared herself an enemy and betrayed his trust.� She�d be punished like the whore she was,
while at the same time providing king and country with the most desired gift of
an heir.� Bred by Morgan, raised by
Guinevere, no one need ever know.

Morgan glared at her brother,
trying not to show the unwanted effect he was having on her:� his mere presence made her flush.� �What do you want Arthur, to kill me?� And you,� she yelled at Merlin, �I suppose
you�ve come to fuck me!� Please, just kill me, she thought, it�d be better than whatever else he has in
store. 

�For now,� Merlin said, �I believe
I�ll just watch.�

�Her breathing and heartbeat had quickened
at Arthur�s touch, and at the taste of her own blood, she knew to her
mortification, that she was wet.� If he
stayed much longer it would be short work to have her begging for a
release.� No one had ever pleased her as
Arthur had, no one had ever excited her as he did, and now, after all these
years of holding the reins of so many lackluster men, to be at the mercy of
this king, it was almost too much to bare.

�No, my love, not kill you� He
laughed then and roughly wrapped his hand around her throat while the other
again found her breast, the nipple erect, betraying her arousal. ��I want to humiliate you, fuck you,� his lips
were at her ear, �break you.�� His hand
left her throat for her tousled curls, tangling in them, pulling, and forcing
Morgan to an opened mouth gasp.� Arthur�s
mouth clamped down on hers, his tongue finding easy access as his left hand
teased Morgan�s nipple, brushed against her flat middle, her softly flared
hips, probing her slit and finding it wet.�
Morgan jerked her face away, her disgust filled glance taking in Merlin
standing in a corner, a twisted smile on his lips.� Arthur smacked her again and then his hand
was at her throat.� He could feel the hot
pulsing of her blood beneath his fingers.�
Such a slender neck, he
thought, so easily broken.� Morgan struggled for air as his grip
tightened, Arthur�s gaze locking with hers.�
What a glorious sight, the pain and fear evident, but perversely mixed
with a sort of ardor and daring; as if she was challenging him to do it, to end
the waste that had become of her life.� 

He let go of her then and returned
his attention to her dripping cunt.� Even
in her tormented state she couldn�t deny his skill.� He was pinching her throbbing clit, rolling
it between his thumb and forefinger, little gasps bursting periodically from
Morgan.� �I fucking hate you!�� She managed to scream.� She winced in pain as Arthur�s grip tightened
in her hair, even as a finger continued to ease in and out of her hot slit,
soon followed by a second.� 

Arthur laughed then and said, �I
wonder, did that boy ever make you wet like this?�

�The boy?�� Morgan was confused, between the exquisite
pain and pleasure coupled with the very nearness to the man she loved and hated
in equal measures, her mind had ceased to function properly.� He kissed her again, his tongue and teeth
finding the split in her lip, the taste of her blood salty in his mouth. �You
mean Accolon.�
What has he to do with this?�� A
little moan escaped her lips as his fingers rubbed again at her swollen
clit.� �He�s just a boy Arthur.� It was you who banished me from court,
remember.� What concern is it of yours
who I take up with?�

Again he jerked her head back,
exposing her pale throat, his mouth immediately going to it; his teeth bruising
and biting� �Why, it�s unseemly, you are
the sister to the King after all, and it becomes my concern especially when my
life is threatened.�� She felt three
fingers being plunged inside of her.�
Morgan�s eyes widened at both her brother�s actions as well as the
knowledge he had just divulged.� She and
her brother had spared for years but this had been a clear cut assassination
plot, known only to herself and�She closed her eyes
and bowed her head, shaking it slowly.�
At the same time her thighs squeezed tightly about Arthur�s hand, her
muscles sucking at his fingers, wanting more.�
Arthur removed his fingers from her slit, her juices making his hand sticky.� �Come now, Morgan,� he said, raising his
fingers to her unyielding lips, �Don�t you want to know what you taste
like?�� Morgan tried to turn her head,
but his other hand shot up, forcing her mouth to open.� The thought ran through her mind that she ought
to bite him, but she could feel his hard prick through the fabric of his
breeches.� She tilted her pelvis towards
him rubbing herself against the hot bulge.�
She knew how wonderful it would feel to have him in her, riding her
hard.� Her lips closed around his
fingers, sucking, and tongue licking; she knew how she tasted and wished for
more.

She moaned as Arthur pulled away
from her and slowly began to unlace his breeches. �Accolon,
he betrayed me.�� Morgan�s body was
visibly shaking with need now and Arthur fought to keep his composure.

�He may be young, but not nearly as
foolish as you thought.�� Her breathing
was heavier now, a faint sheen on her skin, her teeth clenched.� �You�d be amazed at how few men when truly
faced with death, are unwilling to die for love, or in your case, a good
fuck.�� Morgan went flush as Arthur
pulled his prick free from his breeches, remembering that one other time with
him, how wonderful and pure it had all seemed.�
She hadn�t been his first, but he�d still been so young, and he had
looked at her with such awe.� All she saw
now in this advancing man was hatred.

He was close to her now, his prick
hard against her belly, his hands massaging her breasts.� Morgan let her head drop back in rapture,
hoping that the end was near.

�Do you want me Morgan?� Hmm?�� There was a cold smile on his face.� �Do you want me to fuck you?� 

�No! No!�� She whispered, �I hate you!�

�Well, your body seems to be
telling me otherwise. Tell me, Morgan, what is it that you desire, besides my
prick inside you?�� His tongue flicked
over her nipples teasing and sucking.�
Her eyes filled with tears as she stared at the low stone ceiling,
feeling her juices leak onto her thighs.�
�Hmm?�
Tell me sister, what do you want?�
Just tell me, and I�ll give you release.�

She tried to blink back the tears,
wishing for a free hand to wipe them away.�
�I want you to acknowledge Mordred as your
heir.�� She cried out as Arthur sunk to
his knees, took her round ass in his hands and found her slit with his
tongue.� 

He paused, �Our son?� He asked,
smacking her ass before going back to his task.�
Her body convulsed in ecstasy, the sound of Arthur sopping up her juices
adding to her excitement.� His tongue had
found her clit and was rolling it about in his mouth.� 

�Oh, gods!� Yes,� she was finding it difficult to speak,
the words coming in bursts, �Our son,� his tongue was flitting in and out,
circling and sucking at her clit, �You know that bitch Guinevere will never
give you a child.�� Arthur knew she was
close to coming and stood, wiping his mouth with the sleeve of his tunic before
taking it off and throwing it into a corner of the room.� His cock was totally erect now, the veins
throbbing.� There was no question he had
grown into a glorious specimen of manhood, and that Morgan wanted him inside of
her.� 

�You�re right, Morgan, Guinevere
will never give me a child, but don�t worry, everything�s been taken care of,
and I will have an heir to my kingdom.� Our son.�� He said and
kissed her deeply and more gently than before, and this time she
responded.� Her tongue
meeting his hungrily.� She wished
her arms free so that she could wrap them about his broad shoulders.� This
must have all been some sort of a test then, she thought.� She felt herself being lifted and pushed
against the cold stone wall.� Her legs
wrapped tightly around Arthur�s waist as his prick entered her at last.� Amazing that she could feel
this elation while still being chained in a dark dungeon.

His prick plunged in and out of
her, harder and harder, there was nothing sweet and innocent about it.� Morgan�s breasts slapped against his chest,
his mouth occasionally finding a nipple to draw on.� Morgan felt only the constant, insistent pistoning prick driving into her, obliterating all
else.� Suddenly, she felt him pull out of
her, repositioning himself behind her.� With a squelching sound, his prick was once
again thrust into her.� She caught a
glimpse of Merlin in the corner, his hands under his robes, a jerking motion
evident beneath the fabric.� She squeezed
her eyes shut at the sight.� The only man
she hated more than her brother was the old conjurer.

�Tell me you want me.� Tell me you love me.�� Arthur�s breath was hot in her ear.� She could feel her muscles tightening around
his prick, feeling herself on the threshold of coming.� His hands were at her breasts now, squeezing,
hurting, making her cry out.

�Yes, gods, yes, I love you
Arthur!�

�Beg me.�

His hold on her breasts tightened,
bringing on a fresh wave of pain.�
�Please, please.�� She was crying
now in earnest, but from what emotion she had no idea.� Morgan only knew that she wanted release.

�That�s a good girl,� Arthur said
hotly and begun to pump harder and harder into her until at last, his seed
exploded into her, both of them crying out with release.

Arthur rested his head on her back,
pulling his now empty member from her.�
Morgan smiled, totally sated and content for the first time in
years.� A thread of hope wound its way through
her mind; he�d said their son would be his heir.� Perhaps now that he�s spent his anger, things
could be as they had been before.� �Oh,
Arthur, I do love you.� Everything I�ve
done has been because I love you.�

He patted her ass softly and gave a
snort of laughter, not a flicker of reconciliation in his thoughts, �What a fine
whore you�ve become my love.� I�m going
to take great pleasure in fucking you these next few months.�

She felt as if a fist had been
driven into her gut, his voice still dripped with hatred and disgust.� �But, what about Mordred,
you said he�d be your heir?�

Arthur pulled away and laced his
breeches back up, then found his discarded shirt and threw it on.� He then looked her square in the eyes, that smile back on his face, �I never said anything
about Mordred.��
And with that he opened the door to her cell and walked out, a
thoroughly amused Merlin behind him.
