Mistress Wants To Have Fun

It all seems such a short time ago that I met her.

I saw her advert online, a mistress who looks like an Angel and who, amongst other services, was looking for slaves to do her housework.&nbsp; This appealed to me as it was something I hadn&#8217;t done on command before. I wanted so much to come and see her, I rang her straight away. She was very courteous on the phone but firm with me that I should come and see her within 36 hours. I wasn&#8217;t sure why that was necessary but I made time in my diary and went to see her early the following evening.

I had seen mistresses before, but since my last girlfriend left, I had been in several short-term relationships. For some reason, they never worked out and I resorted to some temporary gratification with mistresses for some BDSM pleasures. I could afford regular visits to central London mistresses. There were lots and I could even see them at lunchtime as they were not far from my office. I had a good job which gave me plenty of flexibility on my working hours.

Mistress was somehow different from the others. What she wore was just incredible; expensive designer clothes, a skirt and blouse with very high heeled boots going all the way up a pair of fantastic legs. And she had the most enigmatic smile I had every seen.

She made me welcome, gave me a glass of wine, started asking me what I was after. I said that I would love to worship her shoes and her body, I loved a little CBT, but I wasn&#8217;t really into a lot of pain. For me, it was the idea of total personal domination of me by her. She smiled. She had a few ideas that would make my dreams come true.

&#8216;Ok then Slave, you can start by cleaning these shoes I am wearing&#8217;. No change there, I had cleaned hundreds of shoes for various mistresses over the last few years.

Next I had to make her some dinner. She sent me to the kitchen. It was full of dirty dishes and glasses, empty beer cans and half-drunk wine bottles. She called after me &#8216;and while you&#8217;re there, clean up that mess�..&#8217; I felt a strange sense of delight in the way she gave me her instructions. Just as I&#8217;d seen the mess, she&#8217;d told me to deal with it.

I served her meal�she was pleased. She bade me to my knees and we shared the rest of the bottle of wine, all very civilised, I cleared away the plates and glasses and left the kitchen clean and tidy.

&#8216;Well done, slave, you did well&#8217; she told me. &#8216;Same time tomorrow.&#8217;
My heart sank. I had arranged to go out with a few workmates for a leaving &#8216;do&#8217;.
&#8216;No slave, I want you here the same time tomorrow evening&#8217; she said.
I looked to the floor and promised I would be there.
&#8216;Well done slave, you have passed my first two tests. You can cook and tidy, and you will come and see me when I tell you to&#8217;.
I was suddenly very pleased I was going to give my excuses to the office leaver.

The following evening, I bought the ingredients for her meal. I arrived. She looked incredible again, with a different set of sexy clothes and boots, just as gorgeous.

She told me to come in, and after showing the required respect to what looked like a new pair of red boots on her feet, I was told to go cook and tidy.

The kitchen was in an even worse mess. Lots of empty wine bottles and glasses, but I cleaned then all the same before preparing her dinner.

Suddenly she was at the door. &#8216;I&#8217;ve had a few friends round today. They&#8217;re very needy and they don&#8217;t care about making a mess. That&#8217;s what slaves are for�.&#8217;
I smiled, she saw it and smiled back with a knowing wink.

&#8216;That meal was very nice&#8217; she said after I had prepared, served and cleared everything away.

&#8216;There is no charge tonight for my company. How would you like to serve me on a regular basis, slave?&#8217;

I jumped at the chance. I knew I wanted to be with her every minute I could, especially as she didn&#8217;t seem to want payment for her time.

The days and weeks went by and I went round to her flat every day. She had me cleaning her flat and her car, doing her washing and ironing, walking her dog, sorting out any other domestic problems like leaks and decorating, paying her bills. I was entranced.

One day, some 3 weeks after I had first seen her, she told me to come round at lunchtime. When I arrived, she asked me where I lived.
&#8216;I have a lovely flat by the river, Mistress&#8217; I said. &#8216;It may be slightly bigger than yours, but I keep it clean and tidy, just like I do yours.&#8217;

&#8216;Do you now�.?&#8217; she drawled at me. &#8216;I want to come and see this flat of yours. Take me there now so I can check you&#8217;re not telling me lies about how you keep it&#8217;

We got a taxi there straight away. Fortunately, I had not being telling lies. I like to collect nice things and to keep the place clean. Mainly just a few vases and knickknacks, but I also had a secret that not many people knew about, and that was that I had quite a large upmarket train set set out in one of the 4 bedrooms. I gulped and remembered that in the taxi.

We arrived at my flat. I escorted her in. She slowly looked around as I took her from room to room, first showing her my CD and DVD collections, my impressive computer system and my range of expensive clothes. Pride of place (for me) was my great sound system and large screen TV. I got lost in watching and listening to those each evening when I had finished my daily chores at Mistress&#8217;s flat.
She smiled all the time I was showing her around. She even gave a broad smile when I had to show her the final bedroom, the one with my train set in.

&#8216;Hmmmm&#8217; she pondered. &#8216;This is nicer than my flat. I see that all these flats are occupied by people who are out at work during the day. Is that so, Slave?&#8217;

&#8216;Yes, that&#8217;s true&#8217; I said, not knowing where she was going with that.
&#8216;Good, I may want to use it for meeting some of my friends. Will you mind, slave?&#8217;

I was surprised, but I saw no reason why she couldn&#8217;t entertain here at my flat. It had great river views and a fully stocked bar��.no problem. &#8216;Of course&#8217; I whispered.

Things carried on as usual for another 2 weeks. Then one evening, while I was clearing away, she told me to come and kneel in front of her.

&#8216;Slave, I want to be entertained. I am slightly bored with all the sessions I have to give to slaves and with meeting my girlfriends for endless shopping trips at my slaves&#8217; expense. I want you to let me enjoy myself in a different way at your flat. You will be there of course. Tell me that you&#8217;ll let me have some fun at your flat&#8217;

&#8216;Of course, mistress, I should be honoured to entertain you at my flat&#8217;

&#8216;Are you sure, Slave? You don&#8217;t know what I have in mind, but I do and I shall enjoy myself enormously&#8217;

I stopped, checked, have I missed something here? &#8216;No, of course, it&#8217;s fine, Mistress, you can come round whenever you wish.&#8217;

&#8216;I&#8217;m glad you said that, Slave because you will take me round there tomorrow lunchtime. What I have in mind is likely to be noisy and I don&#8217;t want the neighbours disturbed&#8217;

I gulped. What was in store for me? Did she really like my music collection and wanted to hear it played loudly? For that, I did hope the neighbours would be out.

I picked her up the following day and took her to my flat. As always, she looked amazing, but this day she had dressed in a sheer blouse, very short leather miniskirt and green thigh high boots. To prevent my blushes with the taxi driver, she wore a fur coat which went down to her mid-calf.

We went into the flat. She pointed to the floor. I knew I had to get on my knees.

She strove forward. She looked at a glass vase I had bought from my last African trip. I liked it because it was brightly coloured and went well on the shelf above my marble hearth. She picked it up.

&#8216;I don&#8217;t like this, Slave&#8217; she said.

&#8216;I&#8217;m sorry you don&#8217;t like it, Mistress&#8217; I said, somewhat confused. &#8216;I will put it away out of sight&#8217;

I was too late. She held it at shoulder height above the hearth and let go.
It shattered into a million pieces.

&#8216;When I told you I wanted to have come and have some fun, you said I could. It pleases me that you are happy to suffer a little hardship to make me happy. Are you still happy that your Mistress can have some fun at your expense, Slave?&#8217;

I stumbled over my words but I knew she was right. I WAS pleased to make her happy.

&#8216;Of course Mistress&#8217; I stammered. She smiled that enigmatic smile again.

&#8216;Stay there till I tell you to move&#8217; she ordered.

She saw a tall Yucca plant in a large tub in the corner. She went over to it and placed her lovely boot into the earth, crushing and breaking the base of the plant stalk.

She sauntered over to me, hands on her hips, looking at me with more disdain than I had ever known. Ten of her earthy footprints were spread across the carpet.

&#8216;My boot is dirty, with YOUR earth, Slave! Come and lick it clean&#8217;

I was shocked but immediately compliant. I licked it as clean as I could as fast as I could.

&#8216;Not so clean and tidy this flat of yours now, is it Slave?&#8217;

I looked down and nodded, continuing to lick furiously.

&#8216;I want you to know, Slave, that I shall be coming up here to get my kicks in your flat on a regular basis. You will keep it clean and fully stocked with things I can smash or tread on whenever I want. Is that clear, slave?&#8217;

I nodded furiously. &#8216;Yes Mistress, of course&#8217;.

She stood up. &#8216;Order a taxi and take me home&#8217; she barked.

We had been in my flat all of 10 minutes and she had done a lot of damage which would take me quite a while to clean and clear up. And now I also had a mission to get in plenty of other things to let my mistress have a lot of fun at my flat in the future.

The next day, I arrived at her flat as usual. Nothing was said about what had happened the previous day, and I thought it best not to mention it. I made her meal, tidied up the place and left. And so it carried on. She was always sweet and nice to me in her flat.

One week later, she told me to come to her flat the next afternoon.
This is what I had dreaded. I assumed, rightly, that she wanted to visit my flat again.

When I arrived, she beckoned me in, pointing down for me to kneel beside her.

&#8216;Slave, my girlfriends and I have been thinking of things I want to do at that nice flat of yours and we&#8217;ve thought of a couple of good scenarios. One will involve them all coming round. That will be alright won&#8217;t it, Slave?&#8217;

She knew I would say yes, and I did.

&#8216;For my visit tomorrow,&#8217; (her visit tomorrow wasn&#8217;t an option) &#8216; I want you to get a dozen bottles of nice red wine. Chateau D Esclans, I think. I saw you have quite a few cut-glass wine glasses so they will also be needed. Make sure the wine is there by midday tomorrow. As you will, in future, be busy setting things up for my pleasure, I will arrange to get one of my chauffeur slaves to always bring me to your flat from now on. So don&#8217;t bother coming here tomorrow, be inside your flat, on your knees, waiting for me to ring your bell. Is that all clear?&#8217;

My mind was in spin. She didn&#8217;t say her girlfriends were coming, so what did she want all that wine for?

&#8216;Of course, Mistress. As you command. Thank you Mistress&#8217;

I was beginning to realise the new reality of life with Mistress.

At 12 o&#8217;clock prompt, she arrived. I was on my knees as instructed.&nbsp; She took hold of my tie, held it tightly, smiled that smile and asked my if I had got the wine and glasses. I said that I had.

She dragged me by the tie into the kitchen.

&#8216;Now I want you to set out all the 36 glasses on that table over there and fill them all with the wine. Then go and get out your best china and set it all out on this table behind me. Get on with it!&#8217;

It took me 15 minutes to do what she&#8217;d told me to. When I finished, I went in to tell her in the living room. All my CDs were strewn across the floor, all out of their boxes.

&#8216;That pile I don&#8217;t like, get rid of them, Slave&#8217; she called across to me.

&#8216;Those there, I might like so I want them on long-term loan. She smiled at me again. If I don&#8217;t like them, I&#8217;ll throw them away. Go and put them in my handbag.&#8217;

I did as she told me as she walked round me and back into the kitchen, her heels emanated that lovely clicking sound as she walked across the kitchen floor.

I arrived in the kitchen. &#8216;Now, Slave, is this your best china?&#8217;

I confirmed that, yes, and that it was Royal Doulton.

She picked up a cup. She looked at it, checking it was Doulton. She smiled.

In one quick action, she threw it at the assembled glasses full of wine.

Three of the glasses were smashed and a lot of wine spilled. She smiled again.

Next was a plate. It also hit its target and wine covered the cooker and wall.

She carried on until all the china had been thrown, never saying a word to me.

I stood there dumbfounded. The glasses, the wine, the china, all smashed to pieces.

&#8216;Not so clean and tidy now, this flat of yours, is it, Slave?&#8217;

I could only mumble. &#8216;No Mistress&#8217;

&#8216;But, Slave, you are perhaps learning�that you will always be prepared to suffer a little hardship so I can be happy and have a little fun. Won&#8217;t you Slave?&#8217;

&#8216;Yes Mistress&#8217;

She got out her phone and dialled a number. &#8216;Pick me up NOW&#8217; she barked into it.

She strode out of the kitchen, picked up her coat, went out the front door and was away to the road just as her chauffeur arrived to collect her.

I looked down at the mess. She was right. As long as she was happy, I would put up with a little mess and hardship. Her happiness was the most important thing.

I cleared up the mess. Four minutes of fun for her and three hours of work and a lot of expense for me.

The next day, I arrived at her flat. Again nothing was said, I did my tasks, I left.
That carried on for another two weeks, by which time I thought she had might have had enough fun at my expense and wouldn&#8217;t be visiting my flat again.

Then one day she told me kneel before her. I knew there was another visit coming up.

&#8216;Slave, I want you to go to Saville Row and buy yourself the best and most expensive shirt and tie you can find. There is a reason for this. And I don&#8217;t want you to let me down. Next Friday evening, you will entertain me and my girlfriends at you flat. Get in plenty of drinks. I don&#8217;t want them to ask for a particular drink and you don&#8217;t have it in. So think and plan carefully what drinks you will provide. Same applies to their cigarettes. Do you understand?&#8217;

&#8216;Yes Mistress&#8217;

&#8216;Ok then. We will arrive at 7.30 and we expect to be entertained. Clear?&#8217;

&#8216;Yes, Mistress&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8216;Good, you may go&#8217;

I went to Saville Row. It took me almost half a day to establish the best and most expensive shirt and tie. They cost me nearly �1000 in total.

I went to several upmarket wine shops and bought every possible ladies&#8217; drink I could think of. Another �1000 or so.

Friday night came. I dressed up in my best suit and my new shirt and tie.
7.30 came. The doorbell rang and I opened the door.

In came Mistress and five of her girlfriends who were each dragging a man behind them by their ties. My Mistress was carrying a wide leather collar and lead in her hand. All of the ladies were gorgeous, and all dressed in very expensive clothing, just like my Mistress, all in sheer blouses, short skirts and high heels.

I was dumbfounded again.

Mistress shouted &#8216;I want all of you slaves kneeling down in the middle of the room in a line next to each other, all facing the sofa. Slave, find out what drinks my girlfriends would like, what cigarettes they want, then go and get them. I want a strawberry dacquiri and my usual ciggies. Then come back and join the line.&#8217;

My luck was in. I had in all the drinks and cigarettes asked for, and more besides.

I joined the line on my knees.

The ladies chatted away, drinking their drinks and smoking their cigarettes. That was one thing I had overlooked. I did not smoke and there were no ashtrays. But they didn&#8217;t notice, just flicked their ash on the carpet and stubbed out their cigarettes on the table. They made it quite clear we men were not to move a muscle.

It was a tall blonde, Chrissie, who spoke first.

&#8216;Ok, this was my idea, so I will run the show. It&#8217;s very simple. You slaves have all been instructed to buy the best and most expensive shirts and ties you could find. We mistresses will decide which one of you has bought the best one to use to stub out our cigarettes and pour our drink dregs, over that shirt collar, its cuffs and its tie as we each choose. There will be no appealling our decision.
The mistress whose slave has won for her will be very happy. The rest of us will be very angry our slave has not performed well enough and each of those losing slaves will be punished by having their shirt collars and ties cut off or torn off as we see fit. They will then go home by train in those shirts minus what we have cut off. Understand Slaves?&#8217;

In unison, we all answered &#8216;Yes, Mistress&#8217;

I quickly evaluated the situation. The six shirts and ties probably cost in the region of �6000 and they would all be destroyed within an hour or so. More fun for the girls��
I may have spent a lot on drinks and cigarettes, but at least I didn&#8217;t have to go home by train��.

The girls sat there giggling, pointing and pouting. Several times I was instructed to get more drinks and cigarettes. I was pleased to be able just to be able to get off my knees even just for short while.

It was then that my Mistress spoke to us.

&#8216;Slaves, it has come to our attention that if my Slave were to win this contest, he won&#8217;t have to go out in public without a shirt collar and cuffs. We think this makes it unfair so if he loses, my Slave will have an extra punishment. Isn&#8217;t that right, girls?&#8217;

&#8216;Yes&#8217; they all agreed.

I shuddered. What did they have in store for me if I lose? I didn&#8217;t have to wait long.

&#8216;Girls&#8217;, my Mistress said, &#8216;come and see what he&#8217;s got in his bedroom. None of you slaves may move until we say.&#8217;

They went into the bedroom. I heard giggling and they all came back to the living room.

&#8216;OK. That&#8217;s agreed then.&#8217; she said. I didn&#8217;t know what had been agreed.

The contest began. The Mistresses each inspected all of the shirts and ties on the men kneeling before them, pulling them around strongly to find out how well they had been made. Most of the shirts tore a bit but mine did not. In any event, I expected them all to be in ruins shortly anyway.

I was told to get some more drinks and ciggies. What I had bought was nearly exhausted so I was a bit worried they would run out and I would be punished in some way. In the nick of time, Mistress announced that a decision had been made.

&#8216;Well, slaves, none of you have done well at all. All these crappy shirts have been torn. You have all let down your mistress.&#8217;

I knew my shirt collar was OK, so I must have won!

&#8216;However one of you dickheads has to win. The decision is that Mistress Chrissie&#8217;s slave has the best shirt and tie. We will now award him his prize of ciggies and dregs.&#8217;

With that, they all let fly and the poor guy got covered. His shirt collar disappeared in a flurry of cigarette butts pressed on to it. His tie, formerly bright white satin, quickly became blue, green and red.

I felt cheated. My carpet was almost as messy as that shirt and tie. Nobody cared about that! Then the mistresses came over, each with a pair of scissors. In turn, each mistress addressed her losing slave, slapped his face, told him she was very angry and slowly and carefully used the scissors to cut off his shirt collar in strips, then his cuffs, then his tie.

As each was finished, he was instructed to kiss all of the mistress&#8217; boots and get out of the flat. I was last to be punished.

My mistress looked at me and smiled. Another long enigmatic smile.

She slapped my face, told me she was very angry, then took a long time to cut off my collar, cuffs and tie. But she was smiling all the time. She was enjoying this.

&#8216;Well slave&#8217; she said. &#8216;We&#8217;re not sending you home, are we�.? You&#8217;re already home. Home in this nice flat of yours. Home in this nice flat which I want you to clean up tomorrow because I shall be moving in and you will be moving out.&#8217;

&#8216;But where will I go Mistress?&#8217; I said. &#8216;I don&#8217;t fucking care, that&#8217;s your problem, but I want you to continue to pay all the bills till I tell you otherwise.&#8217;

The other mistresses smiled. They knew what was coming.

Now, Slave. Your final punishment. Much of this stuff of yours can stay here. It&#8217;ll be OK for me to use, mostly as ashtrays I suspect. You will still be cleaning it every day anyway. But there&#8217;s something I don&#8217;t want, and it&#8217;s in your fourth bedroom.&#8217;

She stood up straight and tied the leather collar and lead she&#8217;d brought, round my neck.

&#8216;It&#8217;s a shame&#8217; she said &#8216;but in fact you probably did have the best shirt and tie, but we ladies wanted a little bit more fun with you tonight, now we&#8217;re all alone with you.&#8217;

I was still confused, but she turned to the ladies and beckoned them to follow her. She dragged me to the bedroom where my train set was all set out neatly.

&#8216;This I do not want&#8217; she said, &#8216;I want this room for all my designer dresses which will need temperature controlling and lots of hanging space. Anyway none of this is any bloody good for anything, so you are now going to beg us ladies to help you clear this lot out. Yes, all the stations and buildings as well as the trains, carriages and rails.&#8217;

In confusion, I thought that this could at least wait till tomorrow, even if my beloved mistress wanted me out and her moved in inside a couple of days (I had to clear up the mess first).

But she was looking down at me sideways, hands on hips, waiting for my response.

&#8216;Please ladies, will you please help me clear this lot up so my mistress can have the space for all her clothes?&#8217; I said.

&#8216;Yes we certainly will&#8217; they all said in unison.

And with that, they started stamping all over my lovely train set, over its buildings, the train sheds, the tracks, the little models it had taken me so long to make up, the whole lot.

It was all over in three minutes. It was all destroyed.

The mistresses all went back to the living room giggling and I was ordered to serve them more drinks and cigarettes.

&#8216;Tomorrow, Slave&#8217; Mistress said, &#8216;you will clean this flat from top to bottom, get rid of the stuff I don&#8217;t want, especially all that pile of junk that used to be a train set, and start making arrangements for some new cupboard space to be built and my clothes brought over from my other flat. I shall use both flats and I think I shall be very happy here.&#8217;

The mistresses giggled. They all knew there would be lot more fun to be had in this flat.
