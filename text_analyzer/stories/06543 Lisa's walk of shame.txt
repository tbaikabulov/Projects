Lisa's walk of shame
Provided By: BDSM Librarywww.bdsmlibrary.com
Synopsis: The walk to her car becomes rather interesting for this girl..         







Our short break is at its end when you wake up and realise that it�s already 09:30. And we have to leave the cabin we rented before 10:00 � spotless of course! In one swift motion you�re out of bed, step in the shower and stop dead in your tracks. Suddenly you realise that I�m already gone and so is our entire luggage. You walk through the cabin but everything is gone, your belongings and more important, all your clothes also. Not even a towel is left for you � and since you�re butt naked you don�t have any keys, money or ID on you. 

You hear the door open and storm at me asking where I left your clothes. �Well, they�re already packed in our car. Thought it might save you some time� 
�All right, you bastard, and just what am I supposed to wear now? Just how far did you think we will get with me naked in the passenger seat?!� you fume, your eyes shooting daggers at me.

 �Easy girl, you�ll won�t have an indecent exposure in this� I explain whilst handing you an old cotton sweater of mine. You�ve worn it before, staying at my place getting warm and comfortable. In fact you just love to lounge in. Being an oversized model it fits you like a dress, however the hem just reaches the top of your thighs, making it a kinda mini-dress. The polo-neck, black/grey striping and the old, wrinkled looks of it make you look a bit like some chick from a �girls in prison� movie. After some protests and begging to at least getting a bra of panties, I point out to you that we have to leave in a few minutes, so it�ll be naked or dressed like that. Still muttering you pull the sweater over your head just to feel me grabbing your wrists and before you realise it, your hands are cuffed behind your back. The long sleeves allow a soft protection for your slender wrists. 

�Are you crazy, or what� you yell at me, almost panting with (mock?) surprise and indignation, starting to struggle.. �quiet girl, I don�t suppose you want to alarm our neighbours, now do you? I say, laughing at you. Laying my finger on your lips I silence you, reassuring you: �trust me, it will be exciting and yes, a bit dangerous too, but I bet you�ll gone love it� 
You surrender and meekly allow me to buckle a belt around your waist accentuating your slim figure, but also raising the hem of your �dress� a bit. Then you feel me wrapping a thick zip-tie around the belt and the handcuff-chain, thus making it impossible for you to get your hands in front of you. Next thing you feel me wrapping some sports tape around your fingers, rendering them useless. �Don�t you think this is overkill? � you ask me while I put some slippers on your feet. (I just couldn�t bring me to let your walk barefoot)

 �You talk way too much, girl� I reply and take you by your arm, leading you out of the cabin and closing the door. No turning back anymore! . Now there are about four dozen cabins on this park, making it a park whit a lot of privacy and plenty of space between the individual cabins. However, cars are not allowed, so there is a parking lot next to the area where the cabins are located. The shortest way is a gravel road allowing cars at the park for delivery and emergency purposes. Understandably you prefer the hiking trail around the park, however this means you�ll have to walk a greater distance before you reach our car. 

Meanwhile, I�m not done with you, you still owe me for that �bastard� so I stop you and turn your face towards me. �You know what this is?� � �Looks like a stick to me� you reply, your eyebrows frowning. �Well yes, but not an ordinary stick you know. This one carries the key to your freedom� I explain as I show you the handcuff-key taped to it. Just to make sure we can unlock those cuffs. 
�Yes, and what does that mean� you ask while your eyebrows express your worries. �O, nothing, just that you�ll be carrying this. In your mouth!� I laugh while you get angry at me and start protesting. Once again I silence you with my finger on your mouth. �Silence now, little one, or I can let you play �fetch� with it� I say, meanwhile making a throwing gesture. �Please don�t� you gasp wide-eyed after which I order you to �open wide� and let you bite on the stick. �Comfy? � I ask. �sssshhh sha shaa haa� you reply. And if looks could kill I would be so dead now. 
�Easy girl, I thought it best to have the keys on you while you�re walking around like this. You never know when they might become handy, think about it.� I explain to you. �Of course, it wouldn�t do to put them in your hands and this solution not only stops your talking back but also puts your down a peg or two�

 Yea right, I hear you thinking. The only thing people see when they walk in to me is a girl dressed and cuffed like a runaway from a cheap prison flick with a stick in her mouth like a dog, drooling on my sweater. And it makes it impossible to ask by passers to uncuff me, in fact, it makes it impossible to say anything intelligible. You know damn well that if I tray to say something sensible that stick will drop out of my mouth, and then just how am I supposed to pick it up? I can�t use my hands, not to get the key loose, but also not to pick up that stick.
 Reading your thoughts I taunt you by telling you �you know, if you drop that stick there is only one way to pick it up. Namely, with your mouth, just like a dog. Woof! And you better don�t loose them, because the spares are at home� I laugh. (and lie, but you don�t have to know that) You give me the most angry look ever and I know that there will be payback for this �walk of shame� for sure. However, not yet! You struggle and grumble when I take your arm and start walking again, but nothing comes of that, naturally.

 �You know you owed me a punishment for calling me a bastard, and you know what, this isn�t �it� I tell you. �eh eh shhhee aahh� you answer, and when you notice my amusement about your gag-talk you start to struggle again. I turn you around, stroke your lovely hair braiding it in a ponytail, meanwhile knotting a thin rope in the tail, looping it around your cuffs and back again tying it of in your ponytail. You have no choice than to keep your head up proud, not able to hide your face. You look backwards at me with those beautiful dark eyes pleading �do I hafto�.�, your chest heaving and the first drool dripping on your �dress� only to add to your humiliation. I think I see you shivering, but also notice your nipples are as erect as they can be, poking through the fabric. Laying my hands on your shoulders, I slowly turn you to face me. Looking in those eyes I ask whether or not you�re sure about going through with this adventure. You know if you really don t want to do this, you won�t have to, perhaps paying with a forfeit, but you would be save for now. I stroke your hair again and ask you �are you really sure you can put up with this. After this, there�s no turning back anymore!� You take a deep breath making your decision and nod your head. �sure� I ask again and after you nod again I turn you around again and give you a firm swat on your behind and tell you �off you go then girl, have fun!� You hear the camera clicking and turning around you give me that smile, THE smile. Then you turn around and start you walk towards the parking lot, not knowing how long that will take, who�ll see you� and just what they�ll do with this helpless runaway girl.
