&nbsp; Moira saw him standing at the door of a small restaurant. He was talking to a teenage girl, casting nervous glances around. He definitely had a reason to be nervous. This place wasn&#8217;t suitable for selling drugs. The girl had obviously caught him by surprise and had started talking dangerous things. Dangerous for a drug dealer of course. 
&nbsp; Moira hid behind a car, then took out her gun, feeling its reassuring weight. She was determined to catch him this time. She had longed to send him to jail. For almost two years now. 
&nbsp; She looked at her low heeled pumps, wondering if she would be amble to run fast. 
&nbsp; Dan slipped his hand in his pocket. Moira jumped out from behind the car and ran toward him. The man saw her immediately, his face turning pale, his lips twisting into a nasty smile. He pushed the shocked girl aside and disappeared into the crowd. 
&nbsp; She followed him, running as fast as she could. The people were moving aside frightened by the gun and the wild glare in her eyes. Dan disappeared. She stopped and bent over, breathing like an asthmatic horse. Her blond hair spilled over her face. She was on the brink of tears. A complete failure, again. 
 She steadied her shaky legs and looked back over her shoulder. Just in time to see Dan climbing over a high tin fence. Despite the fact that she was relatively short &#8211; 5&#8217;2 she managed to climb over the fence too. There was a deserted construction site on the other side. 
&nbsp; A six&#8211;storied unfinished building stood at the centre of the plot. The noise from the street was barely audible. Moira looked around her but could not spot Dan. She heard his footsteps though. He was moving up the stairs. She took out her mobile, then realized that she didn&#8217;t know where she was, and slipped it back in her pocket. 
&nbsp; �I have a gun, Dan!� she cried out to him. �Come to me, please.� 
&nbsp; Silence.
&nbsp; Moira followed him up the stairs. She was determined to catch him whatever it might cost her. 
&nbsp; Moving slowly she lent an ear to every sound. She stopped on the fifth floor, looking nervously around her. Empty rooms and abandoned tools everywhere. A noise came from below, a distant footfall, and she hurried down the stairs. As she reached the forth floor landing she suddenly felt a massive blow to her left shoulder. Her body lurched to the right, to the gaping abyss under an unrailed balcony. 
&nbsp; Moira gaped sheepishly, trying to get hold of something. Dan giggled nastily behind her. 
&nbsp; �Bye&#8211;bye, Mo.�
&nbsp; She fell off the balcony, flailing her hands helplessly, screaming at the top of her lungs. Then, the images started to appear &#8211; the tricycle her mother bought her when she was four, her first-grade friend Norma, her father putting ice on her sore knee, her first boyfriend kissing her on the mouth, her graduation dress, the admission examination.
&nbsp; Moira made a somersault and landed on her haunches with a sickening thud. Her scream died out. After a second her trembling arm reached up toward the sun, her fingers splayed. She parted her lips slightly, emitting a soft sigh. Then her arm dropped and her body got limp.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; Dan burst into uncontrollable laughter. 
&nbsp; The pain spilled over her thighs, then shot up her lower back. Moira opened her eyes and tried to prop herself on her elbows. The pain pinned her down, its jagged teeth gnawing at her hips. 
&nbsp; �Oh dear, look what happened!� said Dan sarcastically. �Are you ok, Mo? You don&#8217;t look very well today.�
&nbsp; �Fuck off,� she hissed, trying to stifle the tears that were about to erupt. 
&nbsp; �You scared the shit out of me, Mo. I thought you were dead. But you are a tough girl, aren&#8217;t you?�
&nbsp; �Bastard!�
&nbsp; He kicked her shin viciously. Moira clenched her teeth but didn&#8217;t give any other indication that she was in pain. 
&nbsp; Dan looked curiously at her then stared at the building. 
&nbsp; �It was a hard fall, uh? Do you think you have broken something?
&nbsp; Moira ignored his questions and fixed her eyes on the gun that lay close by. She reached towards the gun but her shoulder was too stiff and she could not get hold of it. 
&nbsp; Dan kicked the weapon aside.
&nbsp; �You disappointed me, Moira. Officer. I thought you were smarter.�
&nbsp; Moira remained silent, the shooting pain had made her dizzy.
&nbsp; Dan placed his hand on her thigh, just under the hem of her skirt, and kneaded it gently. Moira&#8217;s eyes filled with terror which for a moment replaced the pain. He slipped his hand over her knee and traced the curve of her calf. 
&nbsp; �No,� she said with a trembling voice.
&nbsp; He rubbed her ankle, then tickled her exposed toes. Her pumps had slipped off her feet.
&nbsp; �What do you feel?
&nbsp; �No!�
&nbsp; �Just answer my question! Now!� he snapped. 
&nbsp; �You are touching� my toes.�
&nbsp; �Good girl. I have to go now. You stay put.� Dan chuckled, then searched for her mobile. When he found it, he smashed it against a concrete wall.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp; As Dan disappeared behind the fence, Moira started to scream. Five minutes later, her screams getting weaker and weaker, she realized that no one would hear her. The fence was too high, and the street too noisy. 
&nbsp; She ran her hands over her hips, trying to find out what was wrong with her bottom. She thought she felt a swelling, but she wasn&#8217;t sure because the pain drove her trembling hands away, and forced her to stay still. 
&nbsp; Despite the fact that she was lying motionless, her thighs were tightening. But what troubled her most was the strange feeling in her pelvis. It was as if there was a worm there, a worm with teeth. She could feel it writhing inside her, digging into her bones.
&nbsp; She had to do something, had to drag herself to the fence. Then she could� 
&nbsp; She hiccupped, her features contorting. Then she flexed her left knee, placed her foot on the ground, and gingerly rolled herself on her side. The broken bones in her pelvis moved, emitting a popping sound. Gasping for breath, she whimpered, then froze immobile. Irritated, the pain was tormenting her mercilessly, eating her alive.
&nbsp; �What are you doing, Mo?� Hands akimbo, Dan was standing above her, frowning. �I told you not to move. Why didn&#8217;t you listen to me?� She didn&#8217;t answer, just groaned meekly. �You will hurt yourself if��
&nbsp; �Bastard!�
&nbsp; Dan smiled broadly and kneeled beside her.
&nbsp; �Here, I brought you some water,� he said and produced a bottle. 
&nbsp; �Why don&#8217;t you just leave me alone?� The sharpness in her voice melted away as the pain stabbed her right hip. 
&nbsp; �Oh, Mo!� he exclaimed theatrically. �I&#8217;m trying to help you�
&nbsp; �Go to hell with your��
&nbsp; He poked at her thigh with his forefinger, cutting her words short. 
&nbsp; �Does it hurt here, Mo?� 
&nbsp; �Please, stop!� she said, her chin trembling uncontrollably. 
&nbsp; �Ok,� he said and patted her shoulder. �Did you try to stand up?� 
&nbsp; �No, I just�
&nbsp; �What?�
&nbsp; �I can&#8217;t do that by myself. I think I&#8217;m hurt pretty bad. Call an ambulance � please.� 
&nbsp; Dan remained silent for a moment, then roared with laughter.
&nbsp; �You are funny girl, you know that, Mo?�
&nbsp; Moira tried to turn on her back. The bone fragments made the same popping sound as they grated against each other. She cried out shrilly, then slumped awkwardly back. Her eyes were glazed and unfocused. 
&nbsp; �Why did you do that, Mo? You should not move at all!�
&nbsp; �Dan?�
&nbsp; �What, my dear?� 
&nbsp; �I can&#8217;t feel my leg anymore. It suddenly got numb.�
&nbsp; �Which one?�
&nbsp; �Left one.
&nbsp; Dan slipped his hand under her knee and lifted her leg slightly. Moira&#8217;s eyes bulged. 
&nbsp; �What are you doing?�
&nbsp; �You said your leg��
&nbsp; �Just call an ambulance and make yourself scarce. Now!�&nbsp; Her voice was firm and controlled but her eyes were wet. 
&nbsp; �Bad girl, bad girl,� he mumbled and shook his head sadly. 
&nbsp; �But if you leave me here�
&nbsp; �I&#8217;m not going to leave you, Mo!�
&nbsp; He rubbed her knee gently, then kneaded her calf muscles with both hands. 
&nbsp; �Stop!�
&nbsp; �You said you can&#8217;t feel your leg��
&nbsp; �I SEE what you are doing, wretch! Do not dare to touch me!�
&nbsp; �You know what, Mo, your feet are really cute.�
&nbsp; He cupped her heel and traced his forefinger across her instep, enjoying her soft skin. Moira closed her eyes, cursed under her breath, and sighed pitifully. He caressed her delicate ankle, then fixed his eyes on her motionless toes.
&nbsp; �I&#8217;m sorry you got hurt, Mo. I didn&#8217;t want to�
&nbsp; �Dan, listen! If you help me��
&nbsp; �I will help you, Mo! Trust me!� he said with a trembling voice and started kissing her toes passionately.&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Dan stopped sucking Moira&#8217;s big toe for a moment and rubbed his groin with one hand. His eyes had a hectic glint. 
&nbsp; �Tell me Mo, you really don&#8217;t feel anything? I tried to do my best. Do you feel my tongue now?� 
&nbsp; Moira let out a groan and covered her face with both hands. Her fingers were trembling uncontrollably. 
&nbsp; �I asked you something, Mo. It would be nice if you answer my question.� Dan knocked on her ankle, then licked her rosy heel and smiled sheepishly. 
&nbsp; �There is a tingling sensation in my foot but otherwise� 
&nbsp; �What, tell me honey, I would like to know everything!�
&nbsp; �Nothing, except tingling.�
&nbsp; �Gosh! You might have damaged your spine. My poor little girl!� He sniffed her instep, then rubbed his nose on it. 
&nbsp; �I can&#8217;t believe all this is happening,� Moira wailed meekly.
&nbsp; �I was right, I was right,� Dan blabbered excitedly. �I knew you would move, making the things worse. You poor stupid girl!� 
&nbsp; �What are you going to do?� Moira asked apprehensively. 
&nbsp; �You will see. I have a terrific idea� but for the time being I&#8217;m going to focus on you gorgeous paralyzed leg. By the way, is your right leg still functioning? 
&nbsp; Moira bent her right knee slightly, checking its mobility. 
&nbsp; �Bravo, Mo! Maybe things are not that bad after all. 
&nbsp; �I&#8217;m hurt pretty bad, Dan. I need to be in a hospital,� Moira explained as calmly as she could. 
&nbsp; �It suits a pretty girl like you to be hurt pretty bad,� Dan said thoughtfully.
&nbsp; �You are mad!�
&nbsp; Dan grinned like an idiot before looking at Moira straight in the eyes. Then he started massaging the sole of her lifeless foot. His motions were gentle and controlled. It seemed that he was trying to soothe Moira.
&nbsp; �Dan?�
&nbsp; �What, sweetie?�
&nbsp; �I think I&#8217;m going to pass out.�
&nbsp; Dan raised his brow, then smiled mildly and patted her calf. 
&nbsp; �Tell me, what do you feel?�
&nbsp; �I think my pelvis is shattered, completely crushed. I can&#8217;t bear the pain anymore.� Tears started to roll on her pale cheeks. 
&nbsp; Dan put her foot gently on the ground and drew closer to her upper body. Moira gave out a squeal and instinctively lifted her hands to protect herself. 
&nbsp; �Oh, Mo! I&#8217;m not going to hurt you; I&#8217;m your friend already.� He caressed her hands and started kissing the tips of her fingers. Moira was staring at him with her teary eyes.
&nbsp; �Dan, I need to be hospitalized immediately. I&#8217;m going to die if�
&nbsp; �Stop it, Moira! Don&#8217;t try to persuade me! There is no turning back.�
&nbsp; �But� it would be nice� you would sit by the side of my bed�
&nbsp; �No!� Dan grunted angrily. He slipped his hand under the hem of her skirt, reaching for her crotch. Moira tried to stop him, but she was too weak � and too broken. He grabbed her panties and pulled them down. �I feel your pussy, I feel it, it is moist. You like it all, don&#8217;t you? You little bitch!
&nbsp; �Dan, please stop! You hurt me!� She was crying, screaming and flailing her arms frantically.
&nbsp; Dan froze and withdrew his hand, his face reddening. He had never felt so confused. 
&nbsp; �Is something broken down there? There is a swelling, I felt it. The lips� oh, the lips.
&nbsp; �I told you, bastard! My pelvis is shattered into pieces!�
&nbsp; �I&#8217;m sorry, hon, I&#8217;m so sorry. I won&#8217;t touch you there anymore. You know what? You need to be placed in a cast.�
&nbsp; �What?!�
&nbsp; �I think you would look great in plaster.�
&nbsp; �The doctors probably��
&nbsp; �Me, Moira, me.�

Dan slipped his left arm under Moira&#8217;s knees, then, supporting her back gently with his right hand, lifted her up. Moira&#8217;s face drained off any color it had as searing pain rushed up her spine.
�I know it hurts, Mo, but there is no other option. We have to get out of here.� 
Blinking dizzily, Moira rested her head on his shoulder and heaved a deep sigh. She had clenched her right hand into a fist, as though she intended to hit her tormentor. 
�Have patience, it won&#8217;t take long, �Dan whispered, smirking. Moira&#8217;s slightly unfocused eyes lingered on his face. �Be a good girl and everything will be fine, I promise.�
�Where are we going?� she asked timidly. Her paralyzed left leg was swaying limply as he walked, the other one sticking stiffly in the air, its muscles cramped.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
�You will see. Just try to relax now.�
Dan headed toward the tin fence. A minute later he kicked open a rusty door and squeezed out. The people on the street were staring at them, but no one dared to ask a question. 
Moira summoned all the courage she had left and yelled:
�Help! Help me, please! He&#8217;s abducting me!�
The pedestrians nearby were stunned, obviously wondering what to do. Dan poked Moira viciously in the hip with his thumb and her yells immediately turned into breathless sobs. 
�My wife has a hysterical fit,� explained Dan. And that managed to do the trick - the people dispersed.
Moira hiccupped, then rubbed her sore hip with tremulous fingers. Dan buried his lips in her hair, moved them slowly toward her ear and hissed:
�Bad girl, bad girl. You betrayed me when I needed you the most.� He bit her earlobe roughly, tugging on it.
�Dan, it&#8217;s still not too late. You can just leave me here on the sidewalk and��
�No, no, sweetie pie, I won&#8217;t leave you. You need help and I will do my best to help you.�
Moira considered the idea to claw at his eyes, but decided against it &#8211; she didn&#8217;t want to be dropped on the sidewalk.
Dan stopped behind a white van with no windows at the back. 
�Mo, could you please open the back door?�
�Why?�
�You need to be transported to a safe place. Please, Mo, my hands are full and I don&#8217;t want to cause you more pain by placing you on the pavement. 
Moira reached out her hand and reluctantly opened the door. Dan smirked.
�Well done, sugar,� he said and placed her carefully on the floor of the van. Moira&#8217;s moaned, her beautiful face contorting into a tortured grimace. 
�Sorry, Mo,� he said and climbed in, slamming the door behind him. 
�I hope you find yourself in my situation one day.�
Dan patted her on the knee, then took off his jacket and shoved it under her head. His gaze lingered on her unnaturally outstretched left leg. 
�Still can&#8217;t move it, sweetie?�
�Why are you so interested about it?�
�Oh, just curious.�
�Can&#8217;t even wiggle my toes,� Moira said, sniffing pitifully.
�Poor little thing.� Dan kneeled before her, unzipped his pants and removed his erected penis. Moira looked at him fearfully, then tugged her skirt down and placed her hands on her crotch to protect her private parts. 
Dan smiled thinly.
�I&#8217;m not a rapist, dear, moreover, I promised not to touch your cute, curve lipped, deformed by the fractures, and maybe impenetrable pussy. 
Moira&#8217;s cheeks reddened. She opened her mouth to say something but nothing came out.
Dan cupped the heel of her lifeless foot, squeezed it gently, and rubbed her insole with his thumb. Bending over, he placed his cock on her motionless toes and started rubbing them with its shaft. A blissful smile had spread across his face. 
Moira closed her eyes and tried not to think about anything. She felt the soft thrusts via her shattered pelvic bones, which were sensitive even to the slightest movement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
