Synopsis:  a woman is joining her family for a weekend of relaxation. the wrong road leads her to a world she never knew existed






The slave screamed again as the single tail lashed against her back, fetching yet another angry red welt to the surface of her already severely punished back.

Her agonising screams brought only cheers and jeers from those watching the performance. No-one came to the slave&#8217;s assistance, and nor would they.

She was nothing. Simply a new piece of meat on which they could enact their darkest wishes. 

For over an hour the slave had been beaten in one way or another. Twice she had lapsed into unconsciousness, and each time, smelling salts had been placed under her nose, and the beatings continued unabated.

Little of the flesh on her back and legs didn&#8217;t bear the red marks of torture. Her head had already been shaved, and she was secured to a cross, allowing her no chance of escaping what was happening to her.

Another scream split the air, as more of her flesh trembled under the whip.

She knew she could take no more of this, but they, her torturers, wouldn&#8217;t let her sleep, wouldn&#8217;t let her stop. She had no control, and her tears ands screams were totally ignored.

Her whole body felt as if it was on fire. At least four times the whip had snaked up between her legs, the ferocious cracking across her clit, bringing pain no-one should ever endure,. It was at that time she had passed out, but the hooded man with the smelling salts had brought her back to consciousness almost immediately, to endure even more punishment.

Her legs had already given way, and she slumped, held upright only by the strong leather straps around her wrists. These, unyielding straps, held her in place. She had tried several times to pull away, but she no longer had the strength to even try that. All she could do, was hang limply and take whatever was dished out.


It hadn&#8217;t always been that way. She had, until this had started, been a loving housewife, and mother of a two year old daughter, the sweetest thing on Earth.

She had been looking forward to spending the weekend in the country with Paul and her daughter. They had already made their way to the cabin, and she would get there after work.

A full weekend with no worries.

It hadn&#8217;t gone according to plan.

Her car had broken down in the middle of nowhere, and her cell phone had died. She had no idea what was wrong with the car. The tank was full, but it just died.

For over an hour she had waited, hoping another car would come along and help her. But there was nothing. That was one of the reasons Paul had bought the cabin. The isolation. No neighbours, no shops, and no bars. 

At the cabin they could relax and be totally removed from the world.

And at that point, she was totally removed from any world, even Paul&#8217;s.

In the end she had started walking, cursing the heels she was forced to wear for work. She told herself she would have a spare pair of flat shoes in the car in future, just in case she had to walk anywhere again.

It had started to get dark, and she knew that Paul would soon come looking for her. 

The road looked different in the dark. No street lights, and only the moon to light her way. At least it wasn&#8217;t raining.

How long she had walked, she didn&#8217;t know. Her watch was invisible in the dark. Her feet hurt like hell, and she was forced to take off the heels, throwing them away to the side of the road. It didn&#8217;t matter, she had more shoes at the cabin.

She got to the fork in the road, and knew one was the right one, and one led deeper into the country. But which was which? Where was satnav when you needed it?

The road looked the same as the one she had been on the last time, over six months before, but, to her, all country roads looked the same.

She thought she heard a noise to one side. And stopped dead in her tracks.

�Hello? Is someone there?� her voice seemed strange in the total darkness, almost quivering. 

No answer came from anywhere, and she slowly started to move on again. Why hadn&#8217;t Paul already come and found her? It was starting to get a little colder as she walked. In the city, the large buildings gave protection from the night air, but out here, the sparse trees and low hedges, did nothing to help.

She pulled her coat closer, now cursing having thrown her shoes away, as her feet were both sore and cold.

Surely there had to be a farm close by, and she could use their phone to call Paul and get him to come and collect her.

But she could see no lights anywhere. As the moon came from behind a cloud she was just able to see the dial on her watch, eight fifteen. Where was Paul. She had been due at the cabin by six. Surely he had to guess she had got lost, and come to find her.

She stopped and looked back the way she had come. Nothing. Total blackness. Every way she looked it was the same. The curse of the countryside, was that local authorities did not provide street lights. In the city, these were taken for granted, but here, there was no such need for them, and no provision.

Again, she thought she heard a noise from one side of the road. She felt herself shiver, as she looked around. She could see nothing, and when she had repeatedly asked if anyone was there, and got no answer, she forced her feet forwards again.

She had walked, what felt like, another couple of miles, when she had seen the light. 

It was over to her left, and had she been on the correct road, about the same distance as the cabin would be from the road. Had she made it? 

She walked faster, ignoring the cold and her feet, more than happy to see the lights getting brighter as she neared the building. 

As she got closer, she knew it wasn&#8217;t the cabin, but at least they may have a phone so she could call Paul.

As she reached the building she could see it was a ram-shackled&nbsp; farmhouse. She felt disappointed, though she didn&#8217;t know why. Maybe she had hoped for a warm fire by which she could wait for Paul, or maybe the run down appearance of the building simply made her feel uncomfortable.

Either way, she had no choice. This was the only building she had passed, and the lights showed the dial of her watch again. It was nine thirty. She needed a rest, and she needed warmth.

Gingerly she knocked on the heavy wooden door, listening for sounds inside. She could hear footsteps moving towards it, and moments later the door was flung open, the light from inside the house momentarily blinding her.

As she began to see again, she was faced by a large man, with ruffled black hair, standing in the doorway. His smile was warm. As she started to ask for his help, explaining what had happened to her.

�We don&#8217;t have a phone here, but come in and get warm, then we will take you back to your car and see if we can fix it�

Relieved to get out of the cold night air, she accepted his invitation, and entered the house. She could smell hot food, and only then did she realise she was hungry.

As the man led her through to the kitchen, there were three other men all sat around a large wooden table, eating their evening meal.

�This lady need some help� said the man who had opened the door to her. �Billy Bob, get her a cup of coffee, and a plate. She looks as if she needs something to eat as well.�

Billy Bob, who looked the youngest of the four, rose from his chair and reached towards the cupboard behind him for a cup and another plate.
Moments later, she was sat at the table, steaming coffee in front of her, and a plate of stew, the same as the men were eating. It tasted quite pleasant, which somehow surprised her. That four men could actually cook, had never entered her head.

There was a little small talk, as she explained to the other three what had happened, and that she was meant to be at another cabin, with her husband and daughter, but the car had broken down.

The three nodded their heads, understanding her predicament.

She had started to warm up, and the stew had done much to make her feel human again.

It happened fast, and unexpectedly. She turned her head to answer one of the men&#8217;s questions, and as she turned her head back, so take a drink from her cup, the fist hit her on the side of the head, sending her crashing from her chair, and sprawling across the floor.

Even before she could begin to get up, wondering what had happened, the four men had surrounded her, two of them lifting her to her feet, pulling her arms painfully back behind her.

The first man she had seen sent his feet out viciously against her shins, the steel boot hitting bone, sending her crashing to her knees again.

She tried desperately to struggle free, but four men against one woman was not a fair fight, and soon one of the men had produced ropes, and was busy tying her hands behind her back.

It had all happened so fast, she couldn&#8217;t believe it was happening. She began to beg them to let her go, but her begging was returned with laughter.

�Get the razor� said one of the men, she didn&#8217;t know which one.

As one of the men disappeared, she was lifted to her feet and dragged to the chair she had previously been sat in, and dumped onto it. More ropes were tied around her, holding her fast to the chair.

She tried to struggle. Screaming to get free, but it was all in vain.

Moments later the other man returned and moved behind her. The oldest of the men grabbed her head, holding it still, as she felt something against the back of her neck. There was a buzzing sound, as the man moved something across her head. 

Laughter erupted, as locks of blonde hair fell to the floor at her feet.

Again and again she tried to struggle free, begging them not to do this, but the man holding her head was far stronger than she was, and time after time the razor was moved across her head, removing her hair. Each time locks fell to the floor, laughter filled her ears, as one after the other of the men, ran their hands over her newly shaved head.

�I always wanted a slave� said one of the other men. �Do we get to keep her?�

�Well, now� the eldest of them said, speaking slowly. �If we let her go, she will only go running to the law. If we keep her, then she will have to earn her keep. Lets put it to the vote. All in favour of keeping her, say aye�

She couldn&#8217;t believe her ears. They were voting on whether or not to let her go, after already having assaulted her. 

One by one the men announced their decision, which, although she couldn&#8217;t believe was happening, came as no surprise to her after what they had already done to her.

Four voices, four voting to keep her. This couldn&#8217;t be true, but try as she may, there was no escape from the chair to which she was bound.

She looked at the floor, tears filling her eyes, as she saw the blonde locks that had recently adorned her head, now laying lifeless on the floor at&nbsp; her feet.

One of the men disappeared and returned a few moments later carrying a knife.

Two of the men began untying her from the chair, and lifted her to her feet, her arms pulled painfully up behind her, lifting her to her toes, as the man with the knife began to cut through her clothing. She tried to kick out at him, but the two men holding her arms simply added more pressure to them.

Within minutes, her clothes lay in rags on the floor, leaving her totally naked, and still in pain.

Again and again she begged them to let her go, but each time, her plea fell on deaf ears. She didn&#8217;t know what they would do to her, but she already knew that had no intention of letting her go.

Someone grabbed her feet, and pulled them together, as more rope was tied around them, pulling her ankles painfully together.

Almost immediately, she was dragged to the door of the house, and out into the dark, cold night. Struggling was now beyond her, her arms and legs restrained and beyond her use.

She knew that whatever they planned for her, she could do nothing to prevent it.

She was dragged to a barn at the rear of the house, and the ropes on her ankles had een exchanged for heavy leather straps. She had been pushed against a wall, facing it, as her legs were spread wide, and the straps fixed to hooks at the based of the wall, preventing her from closing her legs.

Only then were her arms released. She tried to refuse, but two men grabbed a wrist each, and another placed more heavy straps around each, before her arms were pulled high and wide, stretching her.

Then the whipping had started. Each blow was like a line of fire across her back and her legs.

She screamed in agony, but received only laughter for her troubles. They didn&#8217;t seem to care that she was screaming, in fact, they seemed to take pleasure from it, putting even more effort into their blows.

Each time she passed out, one of the men, now wearing a heavy black hood, put smelling salts under her nose to bring her back to life, and still the beating continued.

When it stopped, she was unconscious, and not even the smelling salts could bring her round again.

Her back was totally red, some places already turning black with the bruising. In several places, flesh had broken, and trickles of blood seeped out from her wounds.


She was awoken by the morning sun streaming through cracks in the walls of the barn.

Her back was in agony, but her arms refused to move when&nbsp; she tried to get them to the source of her pain.

Like her legs, they were stretched and tied to the legs of the rough wooden table she now lay on. How she had got there, she didn&#8217;t know.

The rough wood rubbed against her stomach as she struggled to get free of her bonds. A splinter caught her under one breast, and she cried out in pain.

She had hoped all of this had been a dream, a nightmare, but the reality of it soon struck home, as she tried to free herself.

She could hear footsteps coming from behind her somewhere, and moments later the barn door swung open, sunlight now filling the barn.

�I see you are awake, slave.� It was the voice of the eldest of the four men.

�Please� she begged, her voice weakened by the onslaught she had suffered the previous night. Her throat was sore from the screaming, and hardly above a whisper as she begged him to let her go.

�Let you go? Didn&#8217;t you hear last night? We voted on it, and you lost.�

The man started to laugh loudly, as if he had just told the funniest joke he had ever told.

�You are staying here, slave. That&#8217;s what you are now, a slave. When my brothers wake up, we will think about what to do with you, but for now, I have my own ideas�

She heard him move towards the back of the table, where her legs displayed her naked womanhood to him.

�Nice cunt� he said, as she felt him move between her legs. �And used to being fucked.�

She shook her head, begging him not to do this, but there was no escape, as she felt him move closer to her, his cock already exposed, and touching her pussy.

Still begging him not to do it, she could feel as he began to slowly press his hips forwards, the head of his cock slowly finding it&#8217;s way inside her.

His hands moved to her hips, and he began to move forward again. Driving his cock into her inner sanctum.

Screams echoed around the barn, as the man began to fuck her hard and fast.

�This is the first bit of cunt we have seen around her for ages� he said, his breath coming in short sharp blasts.

She could feel him ramming harder inside her, as she fought her bonds to be free of it. But there was no escape, nothing she could do, as he gripped her hips harder, and rammed as hard as he could, his cock driving deep into her pussy.

His breath started to come faster, and she knew he was about to cum.

�Please. Please. Don&#8217;t do it in me.� She begged, as he pulled her hips back to meet the onslaught.

Her plea fell on deaf ears, as the man rammed himself as deep as he could, and stopped. She felt his cock jerk deep inside her, as he filled her with his juices, ignoring her tears and her whimpers.

Almost immediately, he pulled his cock out of her, wiping it on the backs of her legs as he walked away, laughing.

�Wait till the others get a sample of that cunt�.

Tears fell freely as she heard the man walk away, and the barn door close.

Why was this happening to her? Despair filled her world, as she lay helplessly stretched over the table, knowing that, sooner or later, other would come and rape her.

Why wasn&#8217;t Paul there to stop it? Didn&#8217;t he care about her anymore?

She was past caring as the barn door opened again some time later. She knew what was going to happen, and there was nothing she could do about it. There was no fight left in her. The ropes holding her to the table had taken everything she had, and had remained unmoved.

She felt someone move between her legs, and touch her pussy. She steeled herself for the invasion, feeling whoever it was, thrust his hips forwards, his cock sinking full length into her pussy.

Like the other one,&nbsp; it was brutal, and loveless. She had never believed men could treat a woman this way, and now she was helpless to stop it.

Her head shook from side to side, and tears fell easily, but there was no resistance any longer. She had tried everything she could, but this was relentless, and unstoppable.

Even as she felt the man empty his cock inside her, she heard more footsteps entering the barn.

It was as if there was no break. As the one man pulled his cock from her, someone else took his place, filling her pussy yet again.


It was a dream. A nightmare. But one that seemed to have no end. Each of the men had fucked her at least three times, and darkness had clouded the bar once more.

Three times she had felt the whip across her exposed legs, but she was beyond fighting it any more. It was as if her body and mind had simply accepted that she could do nothing to stop them, whatever they did to her.

She had slept, when left alone, a fitful sleep, dreaming of the pain they had inflicted upon her. She was both hungry, and thirsty, but nothing was brought to her. It was as if she didn&#8217;t exist, unless they wanted to hurt or fuck her.

Her tits were sore from rubbing on the rough table all day, and she knew she had more than one splinter in her stomach now. 

Feebly, she pulled at the ropes holding her down. There was no let up, no release. Whoever had tied her down, had made sure she could not get free.

She tried to tell herself that eventually, they would tire of her, and let her go. But another part of her brain told her that they wouldn&#8217;t. couldn&#8217;t. she could identify them if she went to the police, and even then, she knew that was not going to be allowed to happen.

At least, if they killed her, it would put an end to her ordeal.

But what of little Ellie. Her daughter? 

She couldn&#8217;t die. Ellie needed her back home.

Again, and again, she pulled at the ropes holding her down. If only she could get one hand free. But what then? The way they had tied her, even if one hand were free, she would not be able to reach the other one to release it.

Her thoughts and struggles were interrupted by one of the men entering the barn. She waited, as he moved closer. It no longer mattered how often they raped her. Once had been enough, but each of them had already done it several times. Once more would make no difference.

To her surprise. The man began to untie her from the table. She tried to stand, but her legs gave way from underneath her, and she fell onto her knees on the floor.

Other footsteps entered the barn, but she was far too weak to stop them as they lifted her to her feet, and dragged her from the barn, back to the main house.

Inside, she was once again tied to the chair, but with one hand free. A plate of food was put before her, and she was told to eat.

She couldn&#8217;t. she was hungry, but she simply couldn&#8217;t bring herself to eat. These men had beaten and raped her, and now they were offering her food. It was all too much, as she broke into tears yet again.

�She don&#8217;t like our food� one of the men said with a laugh.

Even before she knew what was happening, someone grabbed her free arm and pulled it behind her, securing it to the back of the chair. Another man grabbed her head, pulling it back, as he mouth was forced open.

Before she could stop it, a spoonful of food was pushed into her mouth, and her mouth forced closed. She coughed and spluttered, but could do nothing, as she was forced to swallow it.

Again and again, her mouth was forced open, and then closed, forcing her to eat the food she had been given.

�It&#8217;s not nice to refuse� it was the voice of the elder of the men. �Now eat.�

For over half an hour, she was force fed, her face covered in bits of food, as she had tried to spit it out. Only when the plate was empty was her head released.

�You see� the elder one laughed. �You were hungry all the time.�

�What are we going to do with her� she heard Billy Bob ask. �We have to leave soon, and we cant take her with us�

�We could kill her� replied one of the other men.

�I have a better idea� the oldest one responded.

Moments later he disappeared, and returned a few minutes later with a large roll of duct tape.

Without a word, he began to wrap her head in it, covering all but her mouth. She could see nothing, and her hearing was diminished. She could hear them talking, but was no longer able to make out what was being said.

She felt the ropes holding her to the chair being released, but firm hands holding her, prevented her from running, even had she been able to see where she was going.

She was forced to her feet, and her arms were once again brought behind her back, and tied tightly. She fought, but to no avail. Ever since she had entered this house she had been unable to prevent anything that happened.

She felt the ropes around her ankles, pulled tightly, and more rope around her knees. Any chance of escape, had gone.

She was allowed to slide to the floor, unable to move anywhere, and unable to see.

She felt she had been there for at least an hour, though it could have been seconds. She had no idea. Time meant nothing to her now.

She heard as car start up somewhere outside the house, and moments later rough hands lifted her from the floor, and started to carry her outside.

She felt the cold night air on her still naked body, as she was carried to the back of the car. One of the men opened the boot, as she was lowered into it.

Car doors opened and closed, and moments later started to move.

How long, or in which direction the car was driven, she had no idea. She had tried to get free of the bonds, but their usual efficiency had continued, and there was no way out for her.

The car eventually came to a halt, and she could hear the car&#8217;s boot being opened., hands lifting her from it, and throwing her onto something soft.

�You will be found soon enough� It was the voice of the eldest again. � But be warned, cunt, this isn&#8217;t over. We will be watching you. We will come back for you. And you will be our slave. But next time, cunt, it will be more permanent. You have been warned�

moments later she heard a car door slam, and the engine roar, leaving her helpless and in the dark.


It had taken three days before she was found. They had left her at a disused railway station, where she had eventually been found by kids playing.

Four weeks of hospitalisation, and&nbsp; the police were no closer to finding anything out about her. 

It was pure luck that led to a missing person&#8217;s notification on the system, and they eventually knew who she was.

She had been discovered cold, exhausted and traumatised. Unable to say her name, or what had happened to her.

Slowly, the story began to emerge, and the police had started to put the picture together.

The house she described was the old Wellington place. Abandoned for years. They had visited the place, but had found nothing. It had obviously been used recently, but there was nothing there to show she had been there.

Eventually, she was allowed home, but she was never going to be the same&nbsp; as she had been.

She had forced Paul to drive to the house, but had sat, shivering, in the car, as they parked outside it.

She couldn&#8217;t see them, but she knew they were there, watching her.

They would be back for her. She knew that.&nbsp; They had told her so.

They would be back. And there was nothing she could do to prevent it.

End?
