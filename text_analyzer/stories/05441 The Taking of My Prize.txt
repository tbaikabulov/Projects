The Taking of
My Prize 

I remember the night I took you. I was
nervous as I entered your room. Getting into the house had been easy. I often
wonder why single mothers with children do not double check all the locks
before they go to bed, but I was glad that you were one that did not. 

I had crept up the stairs and found
the door to your room open, perhaps to help you here if your son got up in the
night. I did not want him to disturb us so I had pulled his door closed on the
way past. 

Your hair was scattered across the
pillow. The picture you presented was so enticing that my breath actually
caught in my throat. It was a warm night so you had tossed the covers mostly
off. You were lying on your side with a slight twist to your body that left
your one leg under the cover and your hips at about a 45-degree angle to the
bed. I appreciated that you were facing me. 

I crept closer and looked down at you.
You were wearing a teddy that looked like it was a
dark blue, though I could not be sure in the light. The light coming through
the window highlighted your breasts as they swelled from the position of your
arm. 

I crept slowly closer, trying not to
breathe so loud. I wondered why the stories about this type of thing never
discussed how nervous the rapist was as he made the final approach to his
victim. I felt like I had run a marathon and was sure that either my load
breathing or the smell of my sweat would soon wake you. 

As I stood next to your bed and looked
upon your sleeping face, I wondered how you would feel in the morning. Not that
it really mattered as I was going to rape you anyway, but being the
intellectual type I wanted to get into my victims heads. 

I shifted the knife to my right hand
and made sure the daypack settled on my shoulders, after all, the next few
minutes might get a bit rough. I reached down, unsnapped the holder for the
cuffs on my right hip, and looked down at your last minutes of peaceful sleep,
perhaps forever. As I started to reach for your mouth, I saw the way your
nipple contrasted with the teddy you were wearing and changed the direction of
my hand. I gently cupped your breast, carefully watching you to see your
reaction. You stirred slightly but did not awaken. I ran my gloved thumb across
your nipple and as you began to stir, I pinched and twisted it sharply. 

You awoke with a gasp and a quick
intake of breath, but before you could make a sound my hand covered your mouth
and the knife was next to your eye, with the point resting right on top of your
check bone. 

I knew you could not see the knife
because it we so close to your eye and the blade was
darkened and invisible in the darkness of the room. I knew that all you could
see of me was the white mask I was wearing, a copy of the one worn by a
wrestler I used to watch as a boy. The face was white leather with holes for
the eyes, nose, and mouth, with the rest of my head covered in dark elastic
material to hold it snug. This had the effect of making me look like a
disembodied face floating above you. I watched as the information flowed into
your brain and wondered what your decision would be, to fight me or to wait and
see what I wanted. To be honest I was worried about the first because I was not
sure how strong you were. You were almost my height and weight, and I was not
sure I could subdue you without making to much noise. 

Your thought processes were running a
bit slow for me so I pushed the knife into your cheek a bit, at the same time
as I moved it further up toward you eye. I leaned more on my hand across your
mouth, letting you feel my weight, and pinched off your nose so you would have
no air. 

Leaning down I whispered, �Don�t make
me hurt you.� 

I saw the fight go out of you and I
relaxed just a bit, letting you breath freely again. 

�I need to restrain you, don�t make a
sound. If you understand, close your eyes.� 

I watched as you again judged your
chances, but although you could now breathe, you could also feel the knife as
it punctured the skin next to your eye. I was sure you could also feel the slow
trickle of blood oozing from the wound on your cheek. You closed your eyes and
I slowly pulled my hand back from your mouth, ready to pounce if you opened it.
You started to say something and I simply laid my finger across your mouth, you
remained quiet. 

I grabbed the cuffs and quickly
flipped you onto your stomach. I snapped the cuffs around one wrist, and when I
reached for the other one I could feel the beginning of the resistance you
wanted to offer. I quickly yanked the cuffed wrist up behind your back and as
hard as I could and dropped across your body to hold you in place. I took the
knife and pressed it into the first part of you I could reach, which happened
to be your shoulder. I then rolled my weight forward so that I was pressing
your head down onto the pillow. I let the point sink in a bit and waited for
you to stop struggling. 

When you did, I stood up slowly. I
then placed the knife at your neck. 

�Hand,� I barked in a sharp whisper.


You slowly brought your free hand
behind your back and I cuffed them together. Reaching into my pocket, I grabbed
a Nerf ball and put it to your mouth. You looked up at me, I silently pushed
the knife into your neck, and you opened your mouth. I pushed the ball in
quickly and then took the pack off my back and dropped it next to you on the
bed. I saw your eyes widen as you felt the impact weight beside you, but you
wisely did nothing. I quickly reached into my back pocket and pulled out some
Duct tape that I had already torn off the roll and pressed it to your mouth.


I flipped you onto your back and
looked down at you; I wanted to see you clearer. I moved toward the door to
your room and you began to move and try to say something through your gag. I
stepped quickly back to you and slapped you hard. When you could look at me, I
was standing there with my finger to my lips. You nodded and I moved toward the
door again. 

Stepping out into the hall, I listened
carefully to make sure your son was still asleep, but heard no noises that
caused me to worry. As I stepped back in and closed the door I saw you relax
and smiled. The implied threat against your son would help to keep you in line,
and I am sure that you were hoping I did not know about him. I flipped the
light switch and moved closer to your bed and my prize. 

As I stood looking down at you I
wondered just how I would start the entertainment I had ahead of me. I admired
the way your full breasts were thrust up by your arms being cuffed underneath
you, and the way you pelvis was elevated for the same reason. I smiled and
reached down to run my gloved hand along your side and you flinched away from
me. I knew that would change before the night was over, no matter how you might
feel about it now. I grabbed a handful of your teddy and pulled you up by it,
then used the knife to cut it away from you while �accidentally� nicking you in
the process. 

I sat down next to you on the bed and
admired the way your breasts looked as they spilled from your chest for my
pleasure. I reached toward you with the knife in my hand and watched you freeze
as I used the point to trace the outline of your aureole. I carefully laid the
knife between your breasts and pulled off my gloves. I stood and stripped off
my clothes, tossing them at the foot of your bed. I saw your eyes taking in my
5�10�, 200# frame and saw the questions forming as you wondered what would have
happened if you had fought harder. I knew that in the first minutes after
waking, and the way that I had used my weight to press you down, I must have
seemed much larger and more powerful. 

Your eyes widened as you saw my erect
cock, perhaps a bit longer than you might expect from an average man, and quite
a bit thicker. Once again I wished I could be inside your head. 

I moved toward the bed and climbed on
so that I was kneeling next to you. Picking up my knife I used it &nbsp;to trace my way down to your panties, and then on
down the top of your thigh. I noticed that you had closed your legs and crossed
your ankles in an attempt to keep me from my prize. I looked at you, smiled as
I moved the knife down between your thighs, and turned it so that as I pressed
down, it would slice into your leg. I let the knife rest at the junction of
your legs and pressed myself against your side. 

Looking into your eyes I said, �We can
do this the easy way or the hard way. Either way, we are going to do it.� I
knew you could see the resolve in my eyes as I said it, and I began to press
down between your legs. You resisted at first, but when you felt the knife
start to slice you quickly surrendered and spread your legs. I just smiled and
moved my hand up between you legs. 

Once again, I felt you flinch and I
smiled. I bent forward to your breast, teasing the nipple with my tongue. It
was erect from your fear, and I gently rolled it between my tongue and lips.
You gasped as I did, and even more when I began to bite. I gradually increased
pressure on your nipple, soon reaching the point of drawing blood. You heaved
under me and moaned into the gag and tears began to fall from your eyes.


I carefully slid the knife between the
side of your panty and your leg, slicing it away on that side. I then did the
same on the other side, but I left them where they were. I traced my way up
your body with the knife and between your breasts. I caressed you using the
knife to scratch the skin, knowing that your fear would make it much worse than
it was. 

I laid the knife against your throat,
propping it so that it stayed in place, held by a fold of skin. I moved my hand
against your body, fondling you not with the touch of a lover, but that of an owner
checking the health of his prize animal. I wanted to convey to you that you
belonged to me, and that the only thing that mattered to me was my desire for
your body. 

I then stood and picked up the pack
that was lying at your side. I knew that you were wondering what was in it. I
pulled out a length of rope out and reached for your ankle. I saw as you tensed
to kick, but a quick step and an upraised hand reminded you of your position. I
took your ankle and slipped a prepared loop over it, pulling it up over your
head and securing it to the leg of your bed beneath the headboard. I then did
the same with the other leg. As you were not centered in the bed, I knew that
the asymmetrical strain heightened your discomfort. 

I tossed the pack next to you on the bed
and climbed between your legs, pulling the remnant of you panties off. I took
some time to admire my prize in full. I wondered where I should take you first,
and which you would hate the most. I ran my cock along the cleft of your ass
and up to the top of your cunt, looking into your eyes. You made the first
sound I had heard from you since I bit you earlier as you whimpered into your
gag. I smiled and you turned your head away and closed your eyes. I decided to
let you have that small victory; after all, the night was young. 

I made my decision, and probed into
your vulnerable cunt with my fingers. You tensed again but did not make a
sound. I aligned my cock with your cunt and watched you tense as you felt me
enter your dry channel. I shoved myself fully inside, delighting in the pain
that I knew this caused you. I let myself acclimate to the feeling and than
began pumping in earnest, your discomfort only adding to my pleasure. 

After I had come inside of you, I let
my weight fall onto you I could feel you strain to make yourself comfortable in
the impossible position. You were still looking away, so I grabbed a handful of
your hair and pulled your face around. You kept your eyes closed until you felt
the knife under your chin in the hollow at the top of your throat. Leaving the
knife there I released your hair and gently caressed your face. I then leaned
forward and licked your cheek. 

I knew then that if looks could kill I
would be dead. I laughed and rolled next to you. I was uncomfortable lying
across your leg and shifted myself so that I could use your thigh as a pillow.
I reached into my pack and pulled out the lube so that you would know the night
had only just begun. I smiled at you as I began to probe your anus with my
finger.
