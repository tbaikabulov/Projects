Synopsis:  You'll just have to read and find out, no?






My Fianc� and I have been together for about four years, and the last year in a half we&#8217;ve officially been engaged, though we knew we would be long before he actually made the proposal. Our wedding is being planned, due for next July. The only reason we&#8217;re waiting so long, I fell I must explain, is because I want to be able to drink champagne at my own wedding. I&#8217;m still under 21, and he is very much against the union of alcohol and me while I&#8217;m underage.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In our time together, I have never once found anyone I&#8217;d rather be with, anyone I&#8217;d rather sleep with. Yes, there have been guys more attractive, but I&#8217;ve never felt like this with any of them. I have never cheated on him, which is a lot more than some girls could say. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also, in our time together, we&#8217;ve experimented with most positions, and slave/dom combinations as possible. It started when I was 16. That was the first time we had sex, both for him and I. Don&#8217;t laugh that I took his virginity, just as he did mine. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with that, because we loved each other and we knew our passion for each other would last a long, long time. At the time, I believe he was almost 19, maybe a week or so after it, I can&#8217;t really remember. Since I started dating him, I&#8217;ve also been on birth control, so there were never any worries like that. Another fact that might be important, though he&#8217;s gotten off during almost every one of our experiences (save the ones I told him not to), I never have. I&#8217;ve never had an orgasm, never felt the euphoria that to some is commonplace. It&#8217;s quite frustrating. And I know my love knew this. He&#8217;s apologized for it plenty of times. He thinks he&#8217;s inadequate, despite that I try to tell him the other way around.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now that that&#8217;s out of the way, it&#8217;s time for the actual event. It was late march when this happened. I remember because my love, Jake, was out on a business trip to Seattle, and he was staying with my mother there (she absolutely loves him to, she&#8217;s so proud of me.) I had to stay down here in Portland for work, but I would be coming up Saturday night and then we&#8217;d come home together on Monday evening. This day was Thursday.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At about 8 pm I got off the phone with Jake, after telling him to go to bed, saying I love him and telling him I was also going to fall asleep. This was the first time since I moved in that I&#8217;ve slept in this bed without him. I didn&#8217;t sleep at all that night. First, I just couldn&#8217;t find a comfortable spot, it was odd not having his weight next to me. Second, I just sort of felt lonely. I know that&#8217;s rather possessive, but I did. And I wasn&#8217;t very tired in the first place. I tossed and turned for about a half hour and finally managed to find a good spot. I closed my eyes and started to fall asleep. 
Then there was a click at the door. I had thought it&#8217;d be Emmy or Hal, our two best friends who both had keys and practically claimed the guest bedroom when they were here. Except, it was weird for either or them to come so late at night. I got up and grabbed my pajama&#8217;s, slipping the gown over my head. Usually I just sleep in underwear, which I guess I don&#8217;t so much mind, I love my upper body. I&#8217;ve got fairly large breasts, and though I have some extra weight, I&#8217;m curvy. Besides, I&#8217;ve lost a lot of weight since I left home. I just couldn&#8217;t let Emmy or Hal see me like that. 
I walked out of my room, to the short hallway. I stopped dead. The shadow standing in my living room wasn&#8217;t one I&#8217;d ever seen before. It was tall, taller than Jake, at least, and seemed, from what light I could make out from the sliding glass door, fairly buff. I took a step back, towards my room.
�Don&#8217;t move.� He said. This voice was definitely that of a &#8216;he&#8217;. I stood stiff straight. �Where&#8217;s the phone?� He asked.
�On the counter, plugged into the wall.� He checked the counter in front of the kitchen area, which was, realistically, about ten feet away from the living room. There was my phone, and he jammed it into his pocket. While he wasn&#8217;t looking, I grabbed the hem of my pajamas and tried my best to pull them down, to hide the majority of my thighs.
�Any home phones?� I shook my head &#8216;no&#8217; �Alright, face the wall, put you hands above your head.� I did, I was frightened. I&#8217;ve always dreamed of scenarios like this, but at the same time, they were scenarios, they were safe. There was never any real danger, like now. �Shoe box?� He asked, looking around. 
�In the closet, by the door.� He looked through it. What could he possibly be looking for? �These are yours, right?�
�All the heels are, and a pair of tennis shoes.� That&#8217;s because I love heels, and they work perfectly for my job. And I&#8217;m not a hooker. I&#8217;m a bank teller. It makes good money. 
�Perfect� I heard him mumble. I wasn&#8217;t looking, but out of the corner of my eye he was walking toward me with the old black pair of heels I&#8217;d worn for my mother&#8217;s wedding almost four years earlier. They should still fit, but I don&#8217;t wear them because the heel part was about 4-� maybe 5 inches high. I had balance; I was a dancer, but not that much. �Put these on.� He commanded. I slid down the wall, and started to wrap the straps around my ankles. Though they aren&#8217;t practical, they are sexy, or at least to a bondage freak like my husband-to-be and I.
�Can I ask a question?�
�Already asking for permission? You&#8217;ll train quicker than I thought. Yes, you may.� This comment scared me so badly. Is he going to kidnap me as a slave or something? Why me anyways? I don&#8217;t want to lose everything.
�Do you have a gun, a knife, something?� I had finished getting the shoes on and I assumed he wanted me back against the wall.
�Are you afraid?� He took a few steps closer
�Yes.�
�Then I don&#8217;t need one.� He got behind me and took one of my hands, leading it down my upper body, then pulling it behind me to touch his waist, the was a gun there, in a sheaf. I don&#8217;t actually know what the holders are called, but that&#8217;s all that came to mind at the time. His other hand went up my back giving me a shiver. It decided to rest behind my neck. �I won&#8217;t need this later either.� He pinched the back of my neck in his powerful hands, making me yell out �This will be effective. And I can kill you at anytime with just my hands. The gun isn&#8217;t for you, it&#8217;d be sad if I had to unload it into your head.� He released my neck, but I let it rest against the wall, starting to cry. I had every right to, I was scared for my life, scared to lose what I had, scared of what would come, scared of this stranger, scared for my fianc� and my neck really, really hurt.
He slid down, releasing my hand, but still touching my back, lower back, my ass, then thighs, then calves. My calves were already strong, and there was little excess weight on them, but in these heels they were extenuated beyond measure. He seemed to be in fascination with these, he was rubbing my calves and the back of my knees. I felt like capsizing. 
Though he stayed on his haunches, one hand slid up my leg, under my pajamas, to my underwear. In a quick movement, obviously practiced, he pulled it down. Almost simultaneous, and highly creepy, there was a thunder crash outside. The storm was getting worse, just as my predicament was. By now though, I knew what was going to happen. One way or another I was going to be raped soon. What happens from there, be it death or something worse, I didn&#8217;t know. All I could decipher was that it wasn&#8217;t going to be pretty.
�You&#8217;re wet. I haven&#8217;t even done anything, and your wet. Why is that?� He stood up and for once, I didn&#8217;t reply. He put his hands on my hips and pressed hard, on a nerve. It hurt. �Answer me!� he asserted. 
�I write stories, adult stories, in my free time, and this is similar to one I wrote.� He let go, taking a step away.
�That&#8217;s all? I remind you of a story you wrote? Oh, I get it, these stories you write, they&#8217;re your true fantasies, aren&#8217;t they? You probably dream about them, cream yourself playing with these stories, right?�
�No. I mean, yes, they&#8217;re fantasies, but I don&#8217;t get off to them.�
He picked up a picture on the table before continuing to speak. It was of Jake and I, but I couldn&#8217;t tell which picture that was, it was too dark. �No, he probably gets you off. A strong man like that. He&#8217;s a good fuck?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I think so.� my throat was dry, so I tried to keep the amount of words I had to say to the bare minimum. All I knew was it was in my best interest to answer him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ha-ha, you&#8217;re kidding right? You &#8216;think so&#8217;. I get it, you&#8217;ve never slept with anyone else, have you.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had stopped crying a little while ago, but it started again, lightly. �No one else.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m gonna fix that.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He took one of my wrists and pulled me to the bedroom. I began to scream different things to the effect of �No, please, I beg you.� I don&#8217;t remember exactly, but basically like that.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was strong, I could see it, but I really felt it now. I was off balance, weak, vulnerable. He knew it, that&#8217;s one of the reasons he put me in these. He swung me on to the bed. He climbed on top, holding me by my wrists with both hands with only one of his. I struggled and squirmed, but I couldn&#8217;t get free. He was stronger than Jake, or Jake just didn&#8217;t play as hard. Oh, Honey, where are you? 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please don&#8217;t.� I began to whisper it now. With his free hand, he took the gun out of the holster and pressed it hard under my chin. Leaning in real slow he spoke, very softly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You will first quit talking. Second, I&#8217;m going to let your wrists go. From there you have three options. Tell me you wish to refuse me, and you may, but I will get my way, and it&#8217;ll hurt you. You can say you&#8217;ll be a good little girl, and mean it. That way, I get what I want, it&#8217;s as painless as possible for you, and when it&#8217;s over, I&#8217;ll be gone, never to return. But then again, you can agree and then refuse, try and deny me, after you&#8217;ve given you word not to. Denying included everything from physical force, to disobeying, to asking me not to.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I knew my smartest, but not most faithful answer. I also knew no matter what he&#8217;d get it, sex. These were facts I was well acquainted with, but I couldn&#8217;t help feeling I should tell him no, I should buck it through, perhaps put myself in danger if that&#8217;s what it takes to be faithful to my lover. He sat up, looking down at me, the moonlight, just for a second, reflecting his face between the storm clouds. He was waiting on me. Jake would want me safe, yes. It can&#8217;t be guaranteed, he could be lying, but if there was a chance I&#8217;d live another day, I&#8217;m better off taking it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You agree then? To do whatever I ask of you?� he hissed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I nodded.
�Good� He got off, as promised. �Now, I know you have them, so where do you keep your kinky stuff?�
�In the drawer, inside the wardrobe closet. It needs a key. Top bedside drawer.� He found the key, then the drawer. I rolled over to see what he was getting. 
�Lay on your back. This&#8217;ll be good.� I could sense the gleam in his eyes. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I heard some clanks of metal, maybe shuffling, maybe he was getting something out I couldn&#8217;t tell. I could also hear Velcro. Jake and I had a few types of restraints, and the Velcro ones in particular were my favorite, they didn&#8217;t leave any marks. He got up and left the room for a few minutes. Whatever he took out when he left wasn&#8217;t with him when he returned. I knew it&#8217;d do no good to try anything while he was gone, so he found me exactly they way he&#8217;d left. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He crouched again by the drawer of toys, and pulled something out, throwing it at me. A ring gag. I also noticed he pulled out the ball gag. �Put it on.� I inserted the ring and hooked the leather straps behind my head.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He came and sat next to me, almost touching. He led his hand around the side of my face, to the chin. I could see him clearly, and I did all I could to remember any part of his face that I could. It&#8217;d be helpful for catching the bastard later. �You are so beautiful, but like that, you&#8217;re just plain sexy.� He let go and scooted back. �Tie yourself up. Tight. And don&#8217;t ask how, you&#8217;ll think of something.� I thought for a minute, drooling on myself a little because of the gag. Then I had an idea that I think he&#8217;d prefer. I put a Velcro strap around each ankle, then, sitting on my feet, tied the rest of the straps around my thighs.&nbsp; �Stop there.� I did. He got off the bed and lifted my pajamas off my head. Then he pushed me forward by my shoulder blades. He unhooked my bra and pulled it off me. I began it cry again. �Your arms.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I took the handcuffs from him, since he had collected a few of the toys he found before sitting down. I hooked one around my wrist, dreading it. These cuffs Jake and I had altered. On any ordinary ones, there&#8217;s an escape hatch on the side that you pull and it releases, but we removed it, because, if nothing else, we&#8217;ve got a spare on our key rings along with the original in the drawer. I fell back, laced the cuffs between the posts of the headboard and latched the other wrist in. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now I was helpless, nude, tied and my legs were starting to lift, just because of the position. He could do anything we wanted, and I was frightened. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Next, he got between my legs, and told me not to look at him. I turned away, closing my eyes. I didn&#8217;t mind that. Something pressed against my exposed hole. It was incredibly large, more so than my lover. I thought, just for a second that this was going to hurt. Then the thing between my pussy lips began to tingle, hum and vibrate. I squirmed, desperate to move away. The more I did, though, the harder he pressed it against my hole, rubbing up and down the lips, even getting the clit. It sent electricity through my body. I screamed for a second, my body going as wild as possible. He grabbed the lower part of my stomach, pulling at it, and it hurt, it made me call out, even though I knew no one could make anything of it. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Quit moving.�
He laid down on top of my front, grabbing my breast and fondling it. I still moaned, it was difficult to keep quite, but I stiffened my entire body to not move. It was such an interesting experience. He began to suck on my tit, softly first, then faster, harder. Still, as much as I don&#8217;t want to say it, that hadn&#8217;t happened to me before. The sensations were scary, were shocking, were not un-enjoyable, were shameful, and I hated it. 
His hand slipped down to my pussy, knocking the vibe out of the way, and it almost shocked me back into reality for there to no longer be that constant, uncontrollable movement on my sensitive body. His finger slipped easily, too easily, inside me. 
�You&#8217;re soaking. And very very soon, I&#8217;m going to fuck you. You&#8217;ll cream, you&#8217;ll beg for more, but I&#8217;ll leave you tied like this, until your lover comes back for you.� But that&#8217;s 3 � days from now. �Stay put, I&#8217;ll be back in a moment.� He got up, and two very different kinds of weights seemed to be lifted off me. That of him-this vicious, awful man-who admitted the biggest thing I didn&#8217;t want to hear. The other, some kind of a regret. Was I upset he was done playing like that? I didn&#8217;t think so, but then again, my body has betrayed me before. 
He returned, and I didn&#8217;t see what he was carrying this time, it was still too dark. I looked at the clock, 11:56 pm. About two hours. He came over to me a slipped on a blind fold. It was the one that matched my bonds, as they&#8217;d been bought together in the set.
Instantly as I lost sight, not as though I&#8217;d had much anyway, and each of my available senses began to peak. He climbed on top of the bed; I could feel the heat resonating from his body as well. What the hell? When&#8217;d he get his pants off? Judging by the skin on either side of my head, he&#8217;d taken his pants off and now his cock dangled above my face, of course, though, I couldn&#8217;t see it, and I couldn&#8217;t close my mouth. The shithead was going to make me suck on it.
The head of his cock touched my lips, I hated it, but at the same time, I had to focus on keeping my body stiff, it&#8217;s not as though I could stop the dick, the least I could do was make sure I wasn&#8217;t going to get hurt for the wrong reasons. It slipped through the ring gag, even though I could tell it was a little difficult. He was large in size, I&#8217;ll give him that much. He inched it in, expecting me to suck, but I wouldn&#8217;t do a thing until I was told. As his cock reached the back of my throat, about a half second before I was about to choke, icy cold flooded my body from my hot sex-box. Another metal object, a dildo I&#8217;d had. Did he throw this thing in the fucking freezer? I gagged, and he pulled back a bit. 
�Suck on it. Give me your best blowjob possible.� I had practice with the ring gag as far as giving heads with it, and it was difficult when I was on top, now I had to be forced into length and do it. I began what I could. As always, I relied mostly on my tongue. Wrapping it around the head, using that to get to the hole. Here&#8217;s something interesting, I thought, he&#8217;s circumcised. Not like my lover. It was a big deal when we first started dating, but not as much anymore.
�Ah, Oh� he said, off and on through out the job. Finally he pulled out, and climbed away from my head. This is it, I thought, it&#8217;s all over after this last bit. 
He took the dildo out, pressing his cock against my pussy hole. Just that little touch and I knew, as well as he did, the head was not that wet from my saliva alone. The dildo he&#8217;d just removed was inserted into my mouth. It tasted disgusting. Never before had I tasted my own juices, this must be a fantasy of his. I hated it, but was grateful it was rather medium sized, so it wasn&#8217;t in the back of my throat too much. Then he did it. I hardly felt anything at all. He almost just pressed it against me, just enough to pop the head in, then back out. He did this again a few more times. 
Why can&#8217;t the little fucker just jam it in, take a few pumps, explode, then be done? Is that so hard? I was on the pill so it didn&#8217;t matter if he shot or not. 
He started going a tiny bit deeper. Then back out completely. Over and over again he did this. It was a gentle fuck, though. He wasn&#8217;t being mean, rough. He wasn&#8217;t going to hurt me. I had to get this over with. I knew how to make Jake cum, how different could this bastard be? I tightened my pussy, tried as hard as I could to squeeze this guy&#8217;s dick. I knew I could get him off that way. 
He slapped my face.
�Don&#8217;t you dare. This will not be over quickly.�
A little deeper he went. Out completely. This was driving me insane. At this rate, it&#8217;d be 2 am when he left. Why was he doing this? If he simply lusted me, he wouldn&#8217;t be able to wait to fuck me, truly fuck me, hard, like an animal. At least that I could take, and it&#8217;d be over with. But God Dammit, this wasn&#8217;t going to be. 
A little deeper. He&#8217;s still not even half way in. 
This kept up for what felt like an hour or so, and my body began to cramp, from such tight stiffening. 
At long last, a hard jamming in. one, two, three times he did this. 
Oh, God, stop, please stop. My body began to rock with his. Four, five, six. Give it up, cream and be done, please, please. Seven, eight�.. I lost track. He was stone-hard, ramming more, more.
Shit, he found it. There&#8217;s a spot inside of me that sends a shock through out my body. He hit it again. Part of me went limp, then sprung back to life. Again, again, again.
Harder, faster, rougher, he jammed in, at the same time grabbing my breast and something happened I can&#8217;t explain. My body began to crash. Adrenaline ran every which way, my spine tingled, my hips rocked, My eyes, though dark, blurred. I cried out, loud, louder than before. I couldn&#8217;t think, my mind was spinning. The next thing I realized, he&#8217;d pulled out.
That was it? That was an orgasm? It was an amazing feeling, so it must have been. Never before had I felt like that. My body ached, I was tired, I didn&#8217;t want to think, to move, to do anything. But he did.
The next thing I felt though was hot, sticky liquid. His cum, all over my stomach. 
I felt him move from out between my legs, to my side. I felt him lay down. He removed the blindfold, and the gag, but I was too tired to speak. Instead he put his hand on my breast and laid there.
�I&#8217;ve got a secret.� He whispered. I heard another click outside the door. I wasn&#8217;t thinking, but if I had been, it was somewhere along the lines of thank god, who ever it is is my savior. �I know more about you than you think.� Apparently he hadn&#8217;t heard it. 
The bedroom light flickered on, blinding me for a moment as I looked away. When I did get used to the light, Jake was standing there, leaning against the door frame.
�Did you do it?� He asked the man next to me. I finally got a good look my assailant. He wasn&#8217;t familiar to me at all, but it seemed like Jake knew him.
I found myself thinking by this time, &#8216;What the hell? Kill him, call the police, something. Honey!&#8217;
�Yes, but no kidding, you weren&#8217;t lying when you said it would be difficult.�
�Wait, what?� I shouted. I was ready to move, but my arms and legs being tied made that rather impossible.
Jake came a sat by me on the bed. He found my pajamas and put them over me while he pretty lackadaisical, I might add, searched for the handcuff key on his key ring.
�Darling, don&#8217;t ever doubt that I love you. That&#8217;s why I did this. I hired Daniel here to pretend to rape you.� He unlocked the cuffs and I sat up appalled, but still eager to keep covered. �Shhh, let me explain. You always told me how frustrating it was that you couldn&#8217;t get off, and I realized, I am inadequate, but before you got tied down, married, I mean, not this kind of tied, I wanted to be sure you got to experience it. For months I looked for a dom, at every shop I could think of, and I had lots of guys that were willing to be paid to make you orgasm, but I had to pick the right one. After a long search, I found Daniel here. He agreed to do it, to take the entire night, but that I couldn&#8217;t be there while he did. I agreed, but told him no mutilation of any kind. So we arranged for me to be �gone�, while he did the deed. I&#8217;d come home at about 12:30, sorry I&#8217;m late by the way, and explain everything to you. Oh, and I called your work yesterday evening, I told them you wouldn&#8217;t be coming in tomorrow.�
�Did you enjoy it? You did cum. Was it good for you?� Daniel asked. 
I fell back, looking at Jake. He nodded, and though I was still a little uncomfortable, I told them anyways. �I was so incredibly excited. I didn&#8217;t want to admit it, but it was amazing. As far as cumming, I can&#8217;t believe I did. It was like nothing I&#8217;ve ever known. It was, amazing.�
�Good. Then, Daniel, thank you very much, you&#8217;ve been paid.�
�Alright.� He got up and put his pants back on.
�Wait, so you&#8217;re just going to leave, nothing more?� I asked and he nodded �Then I have a question. I know you wouldn&#8217;t have followed through on your threats, at least I think. Was I actually in any danger?�
He pulled out the gun and aimed it at Jake. �What do you think? And don&#8217;t guess wrong.�
�Please, if your joking, don&#8217;t, I&#8217;m sorry I asked, please, don&#8217;t.�
He pulled the trigger. 
Nothing happened. I sighed in relief. He put the gun back �I&#8217;ll put the key on the counter. The phone too.� And he left.
Jake began to laugh. 
�What?�
�I&#8217;m glad you enjoyed it, that was my aim, but you can&#8217;t love another guys fuck more than mine.� He rolled over on top of me and I hugged him around the shoulders. He replaced my cuffs, then took off all his clothes. For the next two hours we fucked, some times hard, some times fast, sometimes both and a few times sweetly. I didn&#8217;t orgasm again, but I felt wonderful that night.
