The Ideal Student

&nbsp;

By themaneloco

&nbsp;

I have absolutely no idea what I was
thinking!� I guess I could just go with
the classic clich� � it was a good idea at the time.� A good idea it was, but it certainly wasn�t
my idea, at least I didn�t think it was.�
You see, I am a first year student at a respectable university studying
mathematics.� Of course, my parents are
very proud of this, as am I.� They knew
that I was destined for great things from an early age and, along with their
encouragement, I really started to believe in myself.� This may all seem well and good, but this is
where my recent problems started.� I
would later find out that my parents weren�t the only ones that were aware of
my capabilities.

&nbsp;

I am a rather shy boy, always have been,
and the first day of university was very daunting for me.� Lacking a lot of confidence I have never
found it easy to make new friends and I spent many a sleepless night worrying
about how I would fare without my parents.�
Once all of my stuff was moved into my dorm my parents set off back for
home.� I guess they thought that leaving
me alone would help me to get out and make some friends straight away.� The truth was, two days later it was time for
my first lecture and I still didn�t know anyone.

&nbsp;

I entered the lecture centre clutching my
books against my chest, knowing fully well that this made me look
unapproachable.� I briefly scanned my
fellow students, then found a seat that wasn�t close
to anyone in particular and settled down.�
Everyone else was busy chatting away, obviously having no problem mixing
amongst themselves.�
I on the other hand was sat alone in silence, which didn�t really bother
me.� The lecturer hadn�t arrived yet so I
just opened my books and began sifting through some of the basics required for
the course.� It was all stuff I found
fairly easy but I�d always enjoyed revision.

&nbsp;

�Ummm, excuse me,
but do you mind if I sit here?� said a female voice, drawing my attention away
from my reading.

&nbsp;

I looked up and saw a magnificent sight
before me.� Standing right before my eyes
was one of the few perfect creatures that God had created.� I estimated that she stood at just over five
feet tall with shoulder-length brownish hair framing her face.� And what a face it was, almost completely
symmetrical.� She had deep blue eyes that
contrasted nicely with her tanned skin.�
I lost my bearings for a moment and completely forgot what she had
asked.

&nbsp;

�Ummm, I uh� I
mumbled like an idiot.

&nbsp;

An amused look came across her face and I
knew I had already blown it.� Here was my
chance to actually get to know someone and what a person she was.� She had come up to talk to me completely out
of the blue and I�d ruined my chance.�
Girls like this never spoke to me even though I�m a fairly decent
looking guy.� It�s just that I have zero
confidence so they never bother with me.�
Why she had chosen to talk to me out of everyone in the room was beyond
me, but it didn�t matter now as I�d already opened my mouth and put her off.

&nbsp;

�Are you alright?� You seem a bit flustered.� She said adorably
while cocking her head to one side.

&nbsp;

I was quite shocked that she hadn�t just
walked off.� Most of the other girls
would have given up on me already, but she seemed different.� She was nice, a good looking girl that was
actually nice.� A rarity if I�d ever seen
one.� Her tone helped to relax me and
gain back at least some composure.� My
face had been bright red since her initial question and it was starting to
settle down now. �Thankfully, I managed
to remember her question somehow and replied quickly before the uncomfortable
silence went on for too long.

&nbsp;

�Ummm, yes I�m
fine, sorry.� You can sit here.�

&nbsp;

�Cool! Thanks so much, I�m Danielle by the
way� she said while taking the seat next to me and outstretching her hand
towards mine.

&nbsp;

I grasped her tiny hand and gently shook,
gazing into her eyes the entire time.� I
must have held on for too long as she giggled and pulled her fingers from mine.� Once again I proved how much of an idiot I am
when it comes to people skills.

&nbsp;

�I�m uhh
Matthew.� I said quietly, barely louder than a whisper.

&nbsp;

�Nice to meet you Matty�is
it alright if I call you that?� She asked.

&nbsp;

The truth was I hated to be called Matty.� My parents
had called me it from a very young age and I�d never liked it.� However, the way it sounded from her lips was
kind of cute so it didn�t bother me that much.�
Who was I kidding?� She could call
me whatever she liked.

&nbsp;

The rest of the lecture actually went quite
well and I think I pulled it off.� Of
course, we had to keep pretty quiet throughout so I didn�t have a chance to say
anything stupid, but she seemed happy enough.�
On a few occasions she queried me on some of the work and I helped her
out, which she was grateful for.�
Mathematics was my strongpoint and I was sure that if she was having
problems with this simple stuff then she would really struggle later in the
course.� Maybe I could be the one to help
her out for the rest of the year.

&nbsp;

At the end of the lecture she simply
thanked me for the help, gathered up her books and left.� I was really disappointed that she didn�t
hang around, as I was going to suggest that we grab a coffee and get to know
each other a bit better.� I reasoned that
she wasn�t as keen as I was.� 

&nbsp;

The next day I found out why she was in
such a rush to leave.� Coincidentally we both
turned up to the lecture twenty minutes early, so this allowed us to have a
decent chat.� She explained that she
wasn�t being rude the day before, but she was unable to secure a dorm room on
campus as she had applied late.� As a
result she had to commute to the university from home every day, which took her
about an hour by train.� She mentioned
that she�d been looking for somewhere closer to live but everywhere was already
taken.� It was a real hassle for her, but
until she found somewhere nearer she would just have to make do.� She joked that perhaps she could move into my
dorm with me and I had to laugh.

&nbsp;

I felt quite sorry for her having to spend
two hours on the train everyday, but there wasn�t really that much that I could
do.� I would have offered her the
occasional lift home in my car, but I couldn�t afford the petrol.� I just hoped that she would find a place
sooner rather than later.� If she lived
on campus then I would probably get to see her more often.

&nbsp;

Over the next few weeks we actually became
pretty good friends.� It was quite clear
that she was a bit out of her depth with some of the work that we were doing,
but with my help she got along just fine.�
I didn�t mind helping her out as she was always nice to me and she had
taken a chance on me right at the start, whereas most girls would have just
ignored me.� Obviously I found her
attractive, but I also enjoyed her company for her personality.� She was always friendly, had a great sense of
humour and aside from the odd hiccup in the lectures she was very smart.

&nbsp;

In the past I hadn�t been particularly keen
on socialising as I didn�t really know anyone and I always felt that people
were laughing at me.� Danielle convinced
me to go to the student bar on a few occasions and I actually had a pretty good
time.� I could see that all of the other
guys were constantly looking at Danielle and they must have wondered why she
was hanging around with a guy like me.�
She was always getting guys coming up to her, but she never paid them
any attention.� I guess she liked me too.

&nbsp;

Even though we had known each other for a
fair while, the commuting was still causing quite a lot of problems.� I could feel myself really falling for
Danielle and it frustrated me that I couldn�t see her as often as I would have
liked. So, when one day she missed her train, arrived an hour late and missed
the only lecture of the day too, it was all too much for her.� She broke down crying and I wasn�t sure how
to react.� I�d never had to comfort an
upset girl before so I said the first thing that came to my head.

&nbsp;

�Well, uh, I guess you could stay with
me.� I mean, we�d have to be careful as
it�s not allowed, but I�m sure we could work something out.� You could sleep on the floor until you find
somewhere nearer.� I said without really thinking about the drivel escaping my
lips.

&nbsp;

I was just being polite as usual and I
didn�t actually think that she�d take my offer seriously.� My dorm room wasn�t large enough for myself,
never mind a nineteen year old girl as well.�
I�d just said it to cheer her up and I hoped that she would see the
funny side like the last time she mentioned it.

&nbsp;

I knew I�d made a mistake when I caught the
ends of her lips curling into a smile.� She
then leant in and planted a warm kiss on my cheek, which made me blush involuntarily.

&nbsp;

�Oh Matty, you�re
the best.� I knew I could rely on you to
help me out, when can I move my stuff in?� she said,
making my stomach turn.

&nbsp;

I couldn�t believe that she was actually
being serious when she had mentioned it before.�
There was no way that two of us could share my tiny dorm room, but it
did mean that I would get to spend pretty much all of my time with her.� I could make do with the lack of space if it
meant that I got to sleep in the same room as Danielle.

&nbsp;

There was no turning back now anyway as I�d
already made the offer, so I arranged with her to move in the next morning at three am.� I knew that the campus
security would get suspicious if they saw us moving a whole load of new stuff
into my dorm mid-semester.� The early
hours seemed a logical time to get everything in without being caught.� Danielle agreed with me, but mentioned that
she had already made arrangements for the following evening.

&nbsp;

The result was I found myself moving her
stuff in the next morning on my own.� I
had to drive for one hour to her parents� house, pick her stuff up and then
drive back.� With the easy part out of
the way I then had to take all of her stuff to my dorm without getting caught.� I actually managed to pull this off, but I
soon realised that I didn�t have a lot of room to store anything.� I just left all of her stuff piled up in the
room and went to sleep.

&nbsp;

The next day I had planned to drive home to
see my parents, but I was a bit unsure of whether I should leave Danielle in
the room by herself.� She thought the
opposite though, and she assured me that she would sort all of her stuff out
while I was gone.� She seemed kind of
eager to get rid of me, but I guess she just didn�t want me in the way while
she was unpacking.

&nbsp;

I decided to go ahead with the trip and it
was quite pleasant.� I told my parents
about Danielle and they appeared quite pleased that I had made a friend,
especially a girl.� Of course I thought
it was wise not to mention the recent changes in our living arrangements.� I spent the weekend catching up on their
lives back at home and then headed off back to university on the Sunday night.

&nbsp;

I arrived back at the dorms in the early
hours of Monday morning, and I was a bit shocked when I entered my room.� Danielle had done quite a job unpacking and
her stuff was everywhere.� It actually
took me a few minutes to find something in the room that belonged to me.� She must have put in quite a lot of effort as
she was soundly asleep in my bed, which I didn�t mind as I hadn�t been here to
sleep in it anyway.� I decided that I
wouldn�t disturb her, so I made myself up a bed on the floor and tried to get
to sleep.

&nbsp;

I awoke the next morning with a strange
smell assaulting my nose.� I couldn�t
make out what it was so I opened my eyes and was greeted by the sight of a foot
in my face.� Danielle must have rolled
around a lot in her sleep, as the covers were off her and her leg was hanging
off the edge of the bed.� Her foot came to
rest just above my face and I realised that this was probably the closest I had
been to her bare skin since our initial handshake on our first meeting.� I leant forward and took a quick whiff of her
foot.� I didn�t know why exactly as I hadn�t
really thought of feet as a turn on.� I
guess it was just because it was her foot that made it so appealing.� The smell wasn�t actually that bad now I
thought about it so I proceeded to sniff away while she slept.

&nbsp;

After a few minutes I became quite bold and
for some reason I leant up and placed a kiss on the sole of her foot.� The kiss must have been carelessly applied as
she sat up in bed just as my lips left her foot.� In response I quickly closed my eyes
pretending to be asleep and I hoped that she hadn�t caught me.� Suddenly I felt her trace the outline of my
face with her toe and then she softly giggled to herself, pulled the covers
over her legs and went back to sleep.� I
prayed that she was just being playful and hadn�t actually caught me kissing
her foot.� I would have been so
embarrassed if she had.

&nbsp;

Danielle didn�t mention anything about me
kissing her foot the next day, so I assumed that I had got away with it.� I vowed never to put myself in that position
again, regardless of how much I liked her, as it could have been really
humiliating.� However that night, when it
was time to go to bed, Danielle climbed into my bed without even asking.� I thought this was a bit presumptuous as I
had mentioned when I first made the offer that she could sleep on the
floor.� I didn�t really want to seem like
an ass though, so I thought that since she was a girl it would be ok if she
took the bed.� Being a gentleman I would
take the floor.� She openly smiled as I
made a makeshift bed on the floor for myself, then she said goodnight and
settled down comfortably in my bed.� I on
the overhand found it hard to sleep.� It
was bad enough for the one night, but now that I was going to be the one
sleeping on the floor I was secretly hoping that she would find a place for herself pretty soon.

&nbsp;

Over the next few weeks of this arrangement
I started to notice a few peculiar things.�
Initially it was only little things, like whenever we watched my
television we always watched what Danielle wanted to.� I didn�t mind this so much as I wasn�t a big
fan of television anyway, but it�s not like I had a choice.� She always just changed it to something she
liked.� I�d be watching a program and
she�d just pick up the remote and change the channel without asking.� I couldn�t really be bothered to bring this
up as it wasn�t that big a deal.�
However, this wasn�t the only thing.

&nbsp;

Danielle had mentioned when she first moved
in that she couldn�t cook, so I offered to do all of the cooking as I was
actually quite good.� She seemed pleased
with the arrangement as she got to have a warm meal for herself whenever she
wanted.� I thought that it was only fair
that since I was doing the cooking, Danielle should clean the dishes.� She acted a bit reluctant when I mentioned
this to her, but she agreed anyway.� This
didn�t last long though, as the next time I went to prepare dinner after she had
cleaned the dishes I noticed that a lot of them had dried food stuck to
them.� I decided that I would just clean
them myself from then on since she couldn�t do it properly.

&nbsp;

Also, Danielle�s clothes slowly started to
take over the majority of the wardrobe and I found this rather odd because my
clothes were just disappearing.� I
questioned her on it a few times and she just shrugged and said that she didn�t
know what I was talking about.�
Eventually I was down to one pair of jeans, a white t-shirt and a pair
of sneakers.� I had to wash and iron
these every day as I didn�t have the time or money to go and buy new
clothes.� Danielle suggested that since I
was washing and ironing every day then I may as well do hers as well.� I objected at first, but she found some way of
smiling at me that broke me down, then she just talked me around and I found
myself doing all of her washing and ironing for free.� This was on top of her living rent free in my
dorm room and taking my bed.� I noticed
that she was getting a lot more out of this arrangement than I was.� I decided that I would mention this to her
and try to come to some agreement where she would at least offer me some money
for all of the services that I was doing for her.� 

&nbsp;

It was becoming clear that Danielle was
manipulating and taking advantage of me, and I didn�t like it.� I thought that she was a nice, honest girl,
as this is the way that she had always acted towards me.� However, from her recent attitude it appeared
that she was very lazy and expected to be waited on hand and foot.� I had to admit, I did like her company, but I
didn�t know whether I was prepared to be her servant.� I wasn�t sure of how to approach her on the
matter, so I just decided that I would go for it the next time I saw her.

&nbsp;

The next time turned out to be as I
returned from the supermarket with our groceries.� Danielle was relaxing on the sofa as I made
my way to the kitchen and she made no attempt to help me with the bags.� This had to be the time to speak up now.� I finished packing the shopping away and then
approached her by the sofa.

&nbsp;

�Danielle, we need to discuss
something.� I think things have become a
bit one-sided, I pretty much do everything.�
I do your washing, ironing, cook your meals, let you watch whatever you
want on tv, umm you sleep in
my bed and uhh you pay no rent.� I think it�s only fair that you should at
least compensate me in some way, don�t you think?�

&nbsp;

I tried to sound fairly assertive, but even
though I was familiar with her company, I still felt a bit inferior to her as I
spoke.� It was all down to my low
self-esteem, I just felt like hanging around with a girl as beautiful as
Danielle was a privilege and I figured this is why I had let her get away with
doing nothing for so long.� She continued
watching the television and barely paid me any attention.� Eventually she spoke up, although she didn�t
bother to look at me.

&nbsp;

�Oh, I�m sorry if you think I�ve been
taking advantage, but things have just been so hectic with the move and
everything.� You�ve been looking after me
so well, you�re such a star.� I promise
I�ll pay you as soon as I can.� 

&nbsp;

She sounded so sweet and sincere that I
just nodded and walked away.� I felt as
if I had made some progress and she really did seem genuine.� My worries had been aired, I�d made a simple
request and Danielle had agreed to meet it.�
Problem solved.� I didn�t mind
doing the odd thing for her, as long as she contributed to the living expenses.

&nbsp;

A week later and I still hadn�t received
anything from her and to be honest, it was really starting to piss me off.� I decided that enough was enough and I
hastily marched up to her as she lounged on the sofa.� Before I could get a word in she perked up
and asked me if I would massage her feet.�
I found this to be a bit of a strange request, particularly since it was
obvious that I was not in a happy mood.�
I agreed for some reason and with her suggestion I found myself kneeling
before her, softly soothing her soles.

&nbsp;

�I guess you want to talk about the payment
don�t you? Well we�ll get to that in a minute, but first I have some things I
want to say.� She said in between her gentle sighs.

&nbsp;

She closed her eyes for a few moments as I
couldn�t to caress her feet, alternating my fingertips between her toes and
soles.� She did have nice feet and it
wasn�t unpleasant to rub them, it was just further humiliating that she wanted
me to kneel before her while I did it.� I
worked my fingers over her ankles, which brought a smile across a face.

&nbsp;

�I�m a lazy person Matty
and I don�t like to do meaningless things like chores when someone else could
do them for me.� I need someone to look
after me and obey my every command.� Why
should I have to lift a finger when I have someone like you to do it for
me?� I�m a beautiful girl, and you should
be grateful that I let you serve me.�

&nbsp;

What she was saying really hit home with
me.� All of my deep-rooted insecurities
were being brought out by her words.� I�d
always felt inferior to her because of how beautiful and perfect she was, but
now that she was actually acknowledging her superiority I suddenly felt quite
sick.� There were a lot of thoughts
circulating in my head.� If I wasn�t
prepared to continue serving Danielle the way I had been then would she just up
and leave?� I�m sure there are plenty of
other losers around like myself that would jump into my position if they had
the chance.� Danielle wouldn�t find it
difficult to replace me.� The thought of
losing her was a lot worse than doing her laundry.

&nbsp;

I decided that from this point on Danielle
would make all of the decisions and I would just go along with whatever she
said.� It wasn�t like there was any
chance for me to disobey her anyway.� All
she had to do was look at me the right way and I would crumble and give in to
her wishes.� I didn�t have the confidence
to even try to stand up to her, so it just made sense to do whatever she
wanted.� Plus, if I didn�t do what she
said, she would more than likely leave and I would have no friends once again.

&nbsp;

�Now, I�m not a bimbo Matty,
I know you need something in return and if you keep being a good little boy
then maybe I�ll let you have it.�

&nbsp;

I perked up at this as I assumed that she
was going to let me have sex with her.�
This had been on my mind since the first moment I met her, although it
had only ever been a fantasy. �The truth
was I was a virgin and I hadn�t ever come close to having sex with a girl and
even if Danielle was interested, I knew I wouldn�t have the confidence to
initiate anything.� Besides, my
assumption was completely wrong anyway.

&nbsp;

�From the way that you were sniffing and
kissing my feet the other night I guess that you really like them.� She said,
making the hairs stand up on the back of my neck.

&nbsp;

Fantastic, so she did know all along.� It crossed my mind that perhaps her hanging
her foot in my face was actually a trap, which I had fallen straight into, but
that seemed a little too far fetched.�
Anyway, the important thing was that she had caught me and I was in real
trouble now.� There was no way of denying
what I had done and I couldn�t justify it either.� 

&nbsp;

�It�s ok, don�t be shy Matty.� You�re not the first guy to fall in love with
my feet.� If you do a good job of
pleasing me then I may let you kiss and sniff them a bit more.� And if you�re really good, maybe even a
little licking and sucking.�

&nbsp;

She winked at me while giving a cheeky
grin, then lifted her feet in front of my face so she could wiggle her toes
under my nose.� I caught a quick sniff of
their odour and they were actually quite strong.� They may have just been her feet, but because
they were attached to her I began to get a little turned on.� I guess getting to kiss her feet was better
than not kissing her at all.� 

&nbsp;

�Ok, now for some rules. �First of all, I expect you to always be at my
beck and call.� I shouldn�t have to wait
for anything; I want you always eager to serve me.� The first thing on your mind everyday should
be �how can I make Danielle happy?��

&nbsp;

I nodded in response while listening
intently.� I wasn�t surprised by what she
was saying, this is how I had been treating her for the
last few weeks anyway.� She�d pretty much
taken the dominant role in our friendship from the beginning.� It dawned on me that every time we went out,
it was Danielle�s idea.� If we went to
the cinema, Danielle chose the film.� At
the student bar, I had been the one to pay for all the drinks.� My fascination with her had completely
blinded me of all this at the time.� 

&nbsp;

�You will continue to pay all of the rent,
but make no mistake, this is my room now and it is up to me whether I let you
sleep here or not.� Also, you alone will
be responsible for all of the chores, but I guess you already know that.� If you want to keep hanging around with me
then you need to prove that you are of some use.� You can keep on washing and ironing my
clothes, cleaning the room, cooking my meals, driving me around in your car and
drawing my bath.� Also, I may call on you
to fulfil some of my more personal needs, but we�ll get to that later.� Understand?� She said full of authority.

&nbsp;

�Yes Danielle� I replied, briefly looking
up from her feet.

&nbsp;

Fulfilling her personal needs?� This part of the agreement didn�t actually
sound too bad.� Having never actually
pleasured a girl before I wasn�t sure of what was required, but I would give it
my all so that Danielle would be happy.�
Although I may have actually been jumping the gun, she hadn�t been very
specific about what her �personal needs� were.�
Going from the previous example of my �rewards� for serving her, I could
be required to do anything.

&nbsp;

�I don�t think I like you calling me Danielle
anymore.� We need something a bit more
appropriate for our roles, how about Princess?� �She queried.

&nbsp;

�Yes Princess� I responded immediately.

&nbsp;

Danielle smiled, leant forward and lightly
patted me on the head.� She seemed a bit
surprised that I had accepted everything she had said so readily.� Obviously, she wasn�t aware of just how low
my self-esteem was.� I had let people
walk all over me throughout my life and it was a real effort for me to stand up
to someone.� Obeying was a lot
easier.� I continued to rub the soles of
her feet obediently as she carried on with her demands.

&nbsp;

�Good boy.�
I can see that this arrangement is going to really work out for the both
of us.� I receive the treatment I deserve
and you get to remain in my presence.�
Now, we have some more important things to discuss.�

&nbsp;

I found it amusing that she had chosen to
use the word discuss, even though this was a completely one-sided conversation.� However I knew my place and I had no right to
speak up against her.� 

&nbsp;

�As you know, you�re a lot better at this
course than I am.� So as well as making
full use of your physical abilities, I�m also going to let you use your brain
to benefit me.� My parents are the ones
that want me to study mathematics, but I�d just rather go shopping or to the
beach.� I have no intention to attend
class anymore.� So from now on you will
do all of my assignments and you better make sure that I receive As every time,
got that?� She ordered, sounding increasingly more dominant with every word.

&nbsp;

This part would be fairly easy.� None of the work gave me any problems and I
wouldn�t really struggle to complete double the amounts of assignments.� This didn�t mean that I was happy with the situation, she really was taking advantage of me in every
way.� I should have just got up and told
her to get out, but kneeling their massaging her feet, I felt as if I finally
belonged.� Danielle really was a princess
and I would do everything in my power to please her. 

&nbsp;

�Yes Princess, I�ll make sure you get top
marks.� I replied.

&nbsp;

�I know you will my little study buddy.�
She said in a patronising, yet strangely arousing tone.

&nbsp;

She wriggled her feet free from my
fingertips and gently raised them so that they hovered just in front of my
lips.� I glanced up at her peering eyes,
not sure of exactly what her gesture meant.�
She obviously picked up on my confusion as she winked, mouthed the word
�kiss� and then wiggled her toes.� I
obeyed at once.� She shuddered as I let
my lips slowly trace the grooves between her toes, not entirely sure of how to
proceed.� Realising that I needed to
please her I began passionately placing delicate kisses on each of her feet,
kissing every toe individually.� I really
started to enjoy the experience.�
However, she was only teasing me as she removed her feet shortly after
my kissing episode started to get exciting.

&nbsp;

�See, aren�t I good to you?� she said.� �Ok, now I want you to get my bath ready for
me, make sure the water is just the right temperature.� Then while I�m relaxing you can make me some
hot chocolate and prepare my bed.� Don�t
bother with your floor bed thingy, I want you to rub my feet while I sleep
tonight.� I think it�s the least I
deserve for letting you stay the night.�

&nbsp;

�Yes Princess, thank you for letting me kiss your feet.� I replied.

&nbsp;

Later that evening I considered my current
situation as Danielle relaxed in the bath.�
Having her in control of my life was a lot better than not having her in
it at all and I guess this was the reason that I had always been so timid.� I was a submissive at heart and I needed
someone like Danielle in my life to serve.�
It made sense, and I couldn�t have asked for a better mistress.

Over the next few days I really tried to as
much effort as possible into pleasing Danielle.�
Being useful to her meant that she would keep me around.� I thought that if I sucked up to her then she would let me kiss her feet more often.� If it was the only way that I was going to
get to place my lips on her exquisite body, then I was going to take every
chance that I was given.

&nbsp;

This scheme actually worked as the more I
pleased Danielle to her satisfaction, the more time she allowed me at her
feet.� I was mostly given permission to
kiss and sniff between her toes, but occasionally if I was extra good she would
allow me the odd lick.� After two weeks I
pretty much loved her feet and I became aroused at even the mention that I
would be allowed to worship them.�
Danielle had trained me at a skilled and fast pace.

&nbsp;

One time while I was kneeling before her,
tenderly lapping at her soles as she read a magazine she glanced down at me
curiously.� I had always struggled to
meet her gaze when we had first met, and now in our current positions it became
even more difficult.� She gently ran her
fingers through my hair as I soothed her tired feet and then began to speak.

&nbsp;

�Oh Matty, I knew
from the start that you would make an excellent slave.� That�s why I picked you out in that first
lecture.� You looked so shy and pathetic
sat on your own and I knew right then that you were the one.� You see, all you�ll ever be good for is to
lick my feet and do whatever I say.� If I
hadn�t been the one to put you in your place, then some other girl would
have.� Just be glad that you get to worship
someone as hot as me. You really don�t know how lucky you are, so many other
guys would love to be in your position.�

&nbsp;

I did know how lucky I was, but what I
didn�t know is that she had always been intent on enslaving me.� I guess she knew how perfect she was and she
expected to be obeyed, but the fact she had picked me out of everyone actually
made me quite proud in a totally pathetic way.�
If Danielle hadn�t decided that I was suitable slave material then I
would probably still be sat in that lecture centre alone every day.

&nbsp;

�If I hadn�t put you to good use then you
would still be wasting your time trying to be an accountant or something silly.�


&nbsp;

I had to agree with her.� Getting a good job didn�t seem so important
anymore.� As long as Danielle was happy
then so was I.� Whether she planned on
keeping me as her slave after we had graduated I was not sure, but I would
gladly beg her for the opportunity if she allowed it.� Serving Danielle for the rest of my life was
better than any job I could ever hope to gain.�


&nbsp;

Danielle decided that she didn�t have
enough money to spend when she went shopping every day, so I was required to
find a job.� I started work at a local
environmental centre doing night security three times a week, which meant that
I pretty much got no sleep at all those days.�
After working for twelve hours, I had to return to the dorm ready to
serve my princess her breakfast in bed as she liked it.

&nbsp;

The security job actually paid pretty well
due to the rubbish hours.� Of course, I
never got to see any of it.� Pay day
involved me crawling on my knees and kissing Danielle�s feet until she took the
money.� She liked to humiliate me a lot
and I could think of nothing more effective than being forced to beg her to
take my hard earned cash.� My assignments
also suffered with all of the time I spent alternating between working the job
and serving Danielle.� Her assignments
were first priority after serving her, and then came mine, so I rarely had any
free time to work on them adequately.� As
a result, my grades really started to slide.

&nbsp;

Also, my sex life was completely controlled
by her and therefore it did not exist.�
Of course I never had a sex life before anyway, but I had always enjoyed
masturbation.� Danielle put a firm stop
to this and she made it clear that the only person that would be receiving any
pleasure was her. �She found it very
amusing that I would sit there with a hard on with my head between her legs
pleasuring her while receiving nothing in return myself.� I think it actually added to her arousal that
she could control me so easily.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Danielle graduated from university with a
first class degree in mathematics.� I on
the other hand barely passed at all.� Due
to my raw ability in math however I did manage to find a pretty decent paying
job.� It wasn�t the kind of thing my
parents were expecting me to get and they were more than a little
disappointed.� It mattered not anyway, as
my entire salary went to Danielle.� With
her degree, she had managed to land a very flash job and she earned about
double what I did.� With my salary going
into her pocket too she was really raking it in.� She bought a house with the money and moved
me in as her unpaid servant, well I say unpaid but I guess I was paying
her.� She really was the definition of a
modern woman.

&nbsp;

My day pretty much began in the early hours
and I would serve Danielle breakfast in bed.�
She would then lounge around for a few hours while I did menial chores,
occasionally requiring me to massage her feet or tongue some part of her
body.� By ten o�clock I
would drive her into work and then pick her up later in the day, after I had
finished my job.� Danielle brought most
of her work home with her, which obviously I was required to complete.

&nbsp;

From the beginning she had drilled into me
that being at her feet was a privilege and that if I wanted it I would have to
earn it.� This was a very clever way of
her ensuring my obedience as over time I became obsessed with her feet. I found
them to be quite a turn on.� Her toes
gradually decreased in length from the biggest outwards and overall they had a
very cute look to them.� She liked to
have her toenails painted and the colour varied depending on her mood.� I was required to pedicure her feet every day
and I became used to alternating the colour each night.� 

&nbsp;

I looked forward to the pedicure as once I
was finished I was allowed to blow her toenails dry.� Once they were dry, she would give me
permission to suck each of her toes, which I would do eagerly.� As I slipped my tongue between them she would
moan and shuffle in her seat while delicately patting my head.� Occasionally she would whisper that I was a
good boy between her sighs.� It was often
during these times that she would require me to satisfy her �personal needs�
that she had mentioned earlier on in my enslavement.� Having me at her feet and degrading me really
seemed to turn her on and I would often tongue her pussy and asshole to many
orgasms after a thorough foot service.

� 

More recently, Danielle expanded upon her
empire when she announced that we would be moving into a new house.� I didn�t understand how this came about as
she had made no mention of it prior to the move.� It turned out that we were actually moving
into a mansion and Danielle was greeted at the door by a butler.� He was very obedient, just like most men were
around Danielle and I assumed that he wasn�t being paid.� Danielle never seemed to pay for anything.

&nbsp;

A maid in her forties wearing a traditional
uniform took care of all of the household chores.� I was happy with this arrangement as it meant
that all of my attention was completely focused on Danielle.� All day was spent massaging and worshipping
her feet, tending to her wishes or pleasuring her with my tongue.� I noticed that Danielle only ever referred to
her new servants as Maid and Butler.� 

&nbsp;

I later learned that the maid used to be
Danielle�s boss at her accountancy firm and that slowly she had been
manipulated and eventually enslaved.�
Danielle had taken over complete control of the company and the woman�s
house.� Rather than hating Danielle for
this, the maid seemed to be utterly devoted to her.� Also, I found out that the butler used to be
the woman�s husband and Danielle once casually mentioned to me that he had been
far easier to turn over than his wife.�� 

&nbsp;

I didn�t actually know what their names
were before Danielle had taken over their lives.� Danielle deemed that neither were worthy of
anything other than a generic title.� She
claimed that since I was her first enslavement, I was special, so therefore I
was always referred to as Slave Matty, which I
liked.� Also, since I was her special
slave I was always called upon to meet her personal needs, which made both maid
and butler very jealous.

&nbsp;

I often caught sight of their envious gazes
as I kneeled in front of Danielle, licking her tasty feet.� She had always been a tease and she occasionally
let them sniff her toes, which I would have been grateful for, but I could only
imagine their torment.� Despite their
pleas she never ever gave them permission to touch her feet.� If they were really good, then sometimes they
were allowed to lick her shoes or slippers clean, but that was the height of
their rewards.� Having me around to
service her feet whenever she required meant that she could tease her other
slaves as much as she wanted and she really got a kick out of the power.

&nbsp;

Eventually Butler was unable
to control his urges and attempted to lick Danielle�s feet without her
permission.� This resulted in me being
ordered to remove him from my Princesses house and he never returned.� Danielle also considered getting rid of his
wife too, but after many hours of begging she was allowed to stay.� As a gesture to her inferiority to Danielle,
Maid was required to sign all of her savings over to her.� This was the last of her possessions as
Danielle had already secured control of her company and her house.� It amazed me that she so easily accepted that
she would never see her husband again and this series of events also made clear
how unforgiving Danielle was.� It crossed
my mind whether she would so easily throw me aside when the time came and this
only made me strive to please her as best I could.

&nbsp;

As Danielle was now the owner of an endless
amount of money, I was no longer required to keep my job.� My whole day now revolved around tending to
her every need.� She really had the best
life, two slaves working their asses off so that she didn�t have to lift a
finger, neither of which were bitter, but rather
totally devoted to their work.� I think
it�s pretty obvious that some people are just born better than others in life
and if you�re one of the bottoms then there isn�t much that you can do about it.� You can try to ignore it and kid yourself,
but eventually someone like Danielle will come along and expose you as the
slave that you were born.� When this
happens, you�ll find that just like me, you will not be able to resist.

&nbsp;

So that�s how my life is now.� That sweet girl who came to talk to me in my
first lecture became the most important person in my life.� I would do anything for her and all that
matters is that she remains happy. �She
lives a life of luxury as being the head of her own company she doesn�t
actually have to do any work.� All of her
day is spent sunbathing and being waited on hand and foot.� She has kept Maid around for domestic duties,
but I think the real reason is that Danielle loves to rub her nose in the fact
that she has taken everything from her.

&nbsp;

I�ve often noticed that whenever Princess
Danielle requires the bathroom, she simply snaps her fingers.� Maid will then get down onto her hands and
knees so that Danielle can straddle her back.�
It�s actually quite amusing watching Maid struggle to carry Danielle to
the bathroom as she digs her heels into her sides and pulls at her hair.� I don�t know what goes on in the bathroom,
but Maid is always required to go in with our Princess and I can only assume
that she is responsible for some of Danielle�s other �needs�.� It�s amazing how low a person can sink when
they encounter a completely superior goddess.

&nbsp;

She really is a Princess and deserves
everything that she has so cleverly obtained.�
She�s mentioned to me that she has her eye on the girl that lives next
door, a cute twentysomething blonde with nice firm
breasts.� I think it�s the girl�s pool
and car that she is really after, but having another slave will only make her
life even easier.� I will do everything
in my power to ensure that my Princess gets what she wants.
