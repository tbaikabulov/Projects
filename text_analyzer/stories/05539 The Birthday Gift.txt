The Birthday Gift

&nbsp;

It was his fortieth birthday, and I
had decided that it was to be a memorable one. Paul and I had been married for
five years. He was ten years older than me. So, I was twenty when I married
him. Already at thirty, he had this salt and pepper hair that makes women look
unkempt but makes men look sophisticated and dangerous. So he was, I was later
to find out. Sophisticated in his tastes, from food or drink, nothing was too
foreign, strange or disgusting for him not to try. With him, I developed a
taste for exotic foods, frog legs, escargots, and monk fish liver. You name it,
the more potent the flavor, the more he craved it; and with him, so did I.

His taste for liquor was just as
eclectic as his food choices. Not just the single malt Scotch or small batch
Bourbon that the cognoscenti rave about. He had Absinthe brought over from
Slovakia, Raki from Turkey, and a particularly favored Grappa-like drink from
some place in Spain.

I grew up in Omaha, Nebraska, as
Middle America as apple pie and biscuits. That may have been what attracted me,
at twenty, to this man, so much my senior. He entered my life like a tornado,
sweeping everything before him. Soon, I found myself skiing double diamond
terrain, shooting white water rapids, and diving in the open ocean; all things
I had never even thought of doing. We got engaged at 120 ft of depth, in the
great wall of Little Cayman. I was so surprised I almost dropped the ring, and
that would have been a disaster, since the bottom of the ocean is about three
thousand feet deep at that point! I have followed Paul ever since, and never
regretted it for a second.

Now, after five years of marriage, I
decided I shall give him a gift to remember. I changed a lot from the wide eyed
ing�nue from Omaha in these years, but one thing, until now, did not change. I
never accepted his, shall I say temptations? In the matter of sex I remained
the proper conservative American girl. Of course we had oral sex, but aside of
that; the kinkiest thing we ever did was to do it in the kitchen. And I knew,
and know, that he wanted more. He keeps a large collection of erotica, in his
library. Although locked, these books, tapes and art, has always been available
to me; even though I did not avail myself of them until recently. Then I
realized how much I was withholding from him, and for the first time became
afraid, afraid that he would find someone who would give him what I would not.

Fast forward to the present. I found
a willing accomplice in Sakura, a Japanese beauty that frequented our country
club. She was twenty five; we often played golf or skied with her. I do not
believe Paul knew the effect he had on her, or if he knew, he never acted on
it. Me, on the other hand, I knew. It was obvious to me that the oriental
beauty was besotted with Paul. She was always respectful, always polite and
proper, but I could not fail to detect her blushing, her breathing becoming
faster when he approached her. If he talked to her, and touched her arm, she
always would seek support from the back of a chair, table or other piece of
furniture, her knees would weaken so.

I approached Sakura one evening,
about three weeks before his birthday. Paul was traveling that day and, it
being the middle of the week, the lounge at the club was relatively empty; some
women played cards at a table, and a couple of older, retired guys played
chess. Sakura had been playing tennis, and was looking around the bar for
someone to share a drink with, so as soon as she saw me, she approached me,
smiling.

�Hi, Sakura� I greeted her �Care to
drink something?�

�Hi, Lola� She answered, �Of course�

We sat at one of the couches, near
the fireplace, far from the other people. We ordered Margaritas. We made small
talk for a while, until the second Margarita. Then, as inhibitions began to
loosen, thanks to Jose Cuervo, I made my move:

�Have you had sex with Paul?� I asked
nonchalantly between sips.

�Of course not!� She answered angrily
�What makes you think so?� 

�Relax my dear� I said stroking her
hand. �I know you like him. Don�t you?�

The tequila was having its desired
effect. I had eaten a burger before coming to the club, but Sakura just had two
Margaritas on an empty stomach. She answered truthfully.

�You can�t blame me for that. He is
gorgeous� She paused for the briefest moment �But I�ve never��

�I know, I know� I said soothingly �But
you would, if things were�different� It was not a question.

She did not deny it. 

�I have an idea I need your help
with� I continued.

On his birthday, I took Paul to his
favorite seafood haunt. A swanky place, known for its seafood and steaks and
one of the few places in town where you could still smoke a cigar after dinner,
in their cigar room; this was the one place in town where you could go for
dinner in a tuxedo and cocktail dress, and not call attention to yourself. He
always looks so handsome in his tux. I wore a crimson silk number, with a tight
bodice and a flaring skirt that showed off my legs and feet, enhanced by the
Manolo Blahnik sandals. 

He wanted to have steak for dinner,
as he usually did here, but I told him I had made other arrangements for us,
and he understood that sex was in the forecast, so he did not complain about
the food choices.

If he had his way, and ate a
porterhouse, he would fall in bed like a pole axed ox, so, no meat today.

We ate Mikimoto oysters on the half
shell, steamed artichokes with a balsamic dip and grilled salmon and steamed
Bok Choy with a soy ginger sauce. To drink, we had Perrier Jouet cuvee Belle Epoque.
He also got me hooked on that one.

After dinner, he looked at the cigar
room, an eyebrow slightly raised, interrogating. I smiled and said:

�At home�

When we arrived home, the house was dark;
I led him to the bedroom, lit only by a night light, and sat him in his
favorite leather chair, facing the bed. He was about to question me but I
touched his lips with my finger.

�Hush� I said. I led his hand to the
table at his right. In it a crystal bucket held ice cubes, and a large glass
rang crisply as I touched it lightly with my crimson fingernails. I gave him
his cigar, a Montecristo #2 that I had previously cut for him and lit a match
for him to light it. In the light of the match, I saw amazement and wonder in
his eyes.

I pushed him back into the chair, kissed
him and said:

�Wait�

Then I disappeared into the bathroom.
I rapidly changed into a black bustier, that matched the black hose and garter
belt I was wearing, but that, hidden under the skirt, he could not have
noticed. I entered the bedroom, and as I approached the king sized, four poster
bed, flicked a remote control that turned on three spotlights on the bed
leaving the rest of the bedroom in relative darkness.

In the bed, silently, Sakura, dressed
in a white lace bra from La Perla, matching white thong, garter belt and hose,
turned towards me and extended her arms to meet mine. I heard his sharp intake
of breath. 

Sakura and I hugged, and I kissed her
deeply on her lips. My tongue entered her, exploring, as she did the same with
me. I felt my moisture, my need arise, and straddled her thigh, rubbing myself
against her stockinged skin. She did likewise, and I could smell her arousal,
similar, yet so different from my own. We rolled on the bed, touching, probing
each other. I never had a lesbian experience before, but it came naturally to
me; it felt as if I was making love to myself. My bustier came off as Sakura
sought out my breasts, larger than hers, and kissed them, and bit on them. In
my excitement, I could only hug her closer to me, while trying, furiously to
hump her thigh. 

I heard not a word from my husband,
who, in the relative darkness of the room, could be seen only as a dark shape,
sunk in his chair. 

Sakura now pinched my nipples, until
they were standing up, erect, sensitive. She took the right one on her mouth
and sucked on it, viciously, then bit hard on it, until I squealed in pain. She
moved behind me, taking my arms behind my back, and holding them crossed at the
wrist. I knelt now on the bed, my knees wide open, facing the dark shape that
was my husband. I could see the plume of blue cigar smoke, exhaled, and smell
the strong aroma, before it was sucked out of the room by the silent
ventilation system. She threw me on my side, still holding my hands, and ripped
off my garter belt and hose. She used one of the stockings to bind my hands. I
heard the tinkle of ice, on my husband�s chair.

She rips off my panties, and I am
left nude, hands bound behind my back, knees wide open on the bed, ankles
crossed, my neatly trimmed pubic hair, another novelty for Paul, pointing to my
wide open pussy. I can feel the cool air in my moist lips. I can smell myself.
Sakura is as excited as I am. Her skin glistens in the spotlights with a patina
of sweat. She throws me on my back and straddles my face. She pulls her white
thong to a side and smothers me with her sopping wet pussy. I smell her musk,
and lick at her clit, my nose deeply inserted in her hot wet hole. She gushes
more, under my attentions, and I notice the flow of moisture dripping out of my
own. I am embarrassed for a moment, to be doing this, wide open, in front of
Paul, perfectly lit by the spotlights, my pussy gushing, and dripping on the
dark red bed sheets. After only a short time, Sakura rides my nose to the first
of many orgasms that evening.

She stopped to catch her breath, but
only for a moment, for I am given no respite. She turned me, facing down on the
bed, my panties inserted deep in my mouth, and tied in place with my garter
belt. She tied my hands together to the headboard, and my ankles, separately to
the posts at the foot of the bed. My ankles were tied with my stockings. I can
see that my hands are tied with a wide red silk ribbon. 

I saw, on the mirror on the side wall
Sakura approaching Paul, a riding crop in her hand. She offered it to him,
silently; he waved her off. She then She moved to my right, and I cannot see
her anymore.

The swish of the crop, cutting
through the air warned me, a fraction of a second before a line of fire planted
itself on my ass. I tried to scream through my gag, but only a muted howl came
out. And the crop fell, again and again, until my ass was on fire, and I had no
strength to cry out anymore. The pillow under my face was wet with my tears,
and the sheet under my pussy wet with my juices. Sakura untied me and I turned
over. 

Paul stood, in front of his chair,
his erect penis sticking out of his pants; he approached the bed, only to be
interrupted by Sakura, who gently pushed him back into his chair. 

�Not yet� She said �Soon�

She knelt between his legs and took
him in her mouth. She swallowed his length and, holding on to his butt, bobbed
on his dick. I saw her cheeks, hollow with her suction as she blew him
vigorously. It took but a minute for Paul to spill himself down Sakura�s
throat. I saw her swallow, and then lick him clean. She replaced his dick in
his pants, and came back to me. 

I feared her, for I knew what was to
come next. She tied my ankles to the posts at the foot of the bed, and my
wrists to the ones on the headboard. She picked up the crop once more. I could
see Paul�s dick, again tenting his pants.

This time it was my breasts that were
the target of Sakura�s crop. As the leather cut into my tender boobies I
thrashed as much as my bound hands and feet allowed. Yet my pussy continued to
gush. When it was over, Paul was again standing, his dick again out of his
pants which he proceeded to shed. Sakura motioned for him to wait, as she once
again turned me over, and placed me on all fours. My hands tied beneath my face,
and my feet again tied to the bedposts. 

I felt cold air on my ass, as she
separated my ass cheeks. I heard the floorboards creak as he came closer. I
felt the cold gel dripping on my ass hole, and her gentle fingers spreading and
entering, one finger, then a second one. I sank my head in the pillow. I heard
his grunt of pleasure as she spread the jelly on his member. I tried to relax,
to await the inevitable. 

I felt the pressure at the opening I
never gave him, until now, and tried to relax and push against him, to no
avail. My sphincter closed tighter the more I tried to will it open. He pushed
harder, encouraged by Sakura; I moan and, as he forces his way past my
resistance, scream through my gag and into the pillow. Victorious, he entered
my bowels; I felt like I was being ripped apart. He moves out, and I felt his
penis leaving my rectum. I feel the cold air inside, and he enters me again. It
hurts terribly, but is easier too. He does it over and over again, until he
screamed his release. His sperm filled my rear entrance. I now felt a glow, all
over me, of success, of achievement. 

Now, Sakura kissed my ass tenderly
and, with her tongue, cleaned it. With her lips tightly around my still
stretched asshole, she said a single word. 

�Push�

And I did, and she drank again all of
his essence. Then she untied me, and I stood, nude, in front of Paul and
Sakura, and we both said:

�Happy Birthday!�
