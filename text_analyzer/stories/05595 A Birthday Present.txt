A Birthday Present

�Darling, much as I love a good
surprise, I already know we�re going to the country.� I don�t know what the point of the blindfold
is.�� Ella, Lady Bradford, lounged in the
back of the Rolls limo, skirt rucked up around her
thighs, legs spread; a lovely young man�s head between them.

�Why do you insist on talking while
I�m trying to pleasure you, my dear?�� came
the response.� The ride to the Bradford family�s country estate was an hour and a half drive
from the city.� The two had been in the
limo less than a minute before Jamie, the young man, had begun to expertly run
his hands over Ella�s taught body.�
Remarkable, Jamie thought, that only a few years ago Ella had been a
rather short, plump, and totally unremarkable looking girl.� And now, she sprawled before him, a leggy,
raven haired goddess.� Amazing what a few
days a week in the gym and a growth spurt could do.� She�d grown almost six inches, her braces had
come off, and the plumpness had melted away to reveal a face that could have been
carved by Donatello.�


He�d started with her blouse; a
flimsy silk affair with entirely too many buttons for his taste, although he
had to admit it was a pleasure watching Ella�s smooth white flesh reveal itself
inch by precious inch.� Once unbuttoned,
a fine black and white lace bra with just the right amount of ivory cleavage
was unveiled.� Jamie released a slow
sigh, a small front clasp, she knew him so well.� His lips brushed her neck, and then she could
feel his warm breath against her lips, hesitating.� She knew he was watching, waiting for her
body to respond, waiting to see the rise and fall of her chest quicken.

Yes, there it was, her breath was
coming ever so slightly faster now.� He
kissed her briefly, then turned his attentions to her still lace clad
breasts.� With a flick, her two glorious
mounds were released, spilling forth into his waiting hands.� Ella took a sharp intake of breath, a smile
curling her lips as Jamie�s hands gently squeezed her breasts.� He loved her breasts, the whiteness of them,
the perfectness of them; perfectly proportioned to
her 5�7� siren like stature.� A society mag had once compared Ella to screen legend Ava Gardner, a very astute comparison Jamie remembered
thinking.� The dark hair, blue eyes and
lush, but still slender curves.� His
thumbs brushed at her erect nipples bringing first one then the other to his
lips.� He sucked and nipped, knowing how
she loved a taste of pain, the evidence there on her face, her white teeth
biting into her red bottom lip.�
Truthfully, he could have spent hours teasing and toying with her
breasts, but there was a time limit, and so he moved on.

His hands went to her slim boot
encased ankles.� It was winter outside,
and thankfully, his darling Ella never wore anything but boots in winter.� These were some of her favorites he knew,
aged black leather, just of bit of a platform with a three inch heel.� For the last several years Jamie had been
thanking whatever fashion god it was that had brought such things back into
style.� He ran his hands up the boots to
her thighs, the leather crackling under his touch.� They were white and toned, and just like the
rest of her, had the slightest hint of softness.� Her skirt was a long black almost Victorian
looking piece, Ella had always had a taste for the somewhat dramatic and
eccentric.� In fact, her whole outfit put
him in mind of an old fashioned riding habit.�
A little jolt went through his body at the image of her mounting a horse
in such gear.� Jamie�s fingers went to
the hem, raising it slowly to her hips. This time it was he that bit his lip,
no underwear, good girl.� His hands were
up under her ass now kneading. �He kissed
her lips again, still softly.� He knew it
drove her crazy, this kind of slow seduction.�
He�d take her hard and fast later if he had the chance, though he wondered
how much attention he�d receive once he�d given her her
birthday present.

Jamie stole a glance out the
window, surprised to see the exit for the estate coming up.� He must have lost himself sucking at those
sweet tits longer than he�d meant.� Ah,
well, still enough time, the manor house itself twenty minutes off the main
road.� He immediately bent his head to
his task, his lips alighting on her wet slit, the surrounding hair neat and
trim.� He rather enjoyed a shaved cunt on blondes and redheads, but he�d always thought
brunettes looked, well, rather, bare and silly in such a state. �And that is where the story began�

Ella�s head lolled back against the
leather seat, a slow deep-throated moan issuing from her lips before she said,
�Darling, much as I love a good surprise, I already know we�re going to the
country.� I don�t know what the point of
the blindfold is.� 

To which Jamie had replied, �Why do
you insist on talking while I�m trying to pleasure you, my dear?�� 

Ella laughed softly at that and
said, �You�re right, please continue.�

Jamie shook his head at the slight condescending
tone in her voice, at some point this week he would have to remind her that he
wasn�t one her ridiculous suitors to be talked down to.� He loved her, but she could be a fucking
bitch.� He smirked, she certainly was
about to be fucked bitch.� �Turn around
Ella,� he said sternly.

�What?�

�Get on the floor, on your knees,
and turn around.�

Ella did as she was told,
recognizing the seriousness in his voice.�
She wasn�t scared though, if anything it only served to make her wetter.� Now it was her firm belly pushed up against
the slope of the leather seat.� Jamie
reached around her front and flopped her breasts over on top of the seat.� The whiteness of her breasts a lovely picture
against the rich brown leather.� He undid
his alligator belt and dropped his expensive slacks to the ground and pulled
out his erect seven inch cock.� He�d
never minded not having some huge member, Ella thought them disgusting and his
was quite simply perfectly built to fill up her hot, wet cunt.� Normally, He�d want her totally nude, or at
least her top off, back exposed, but after her snide little comment, this just
seemed a little crueler.� One hand went
to her small waist while his other brushed her hair away from her neck, his
mouth tugging lightly at an earlobe.

�Oh, do hurry Jamie.�� Ella was half pleading, half commanding.� If it had been any other woman, Jamie swore,
he would have stripped the bitch and left her on the side of the road.� Instead, he grabbed his prick and shoved it
straight up into her steaming cunt.� A cry of surprise and relief came from Ella
as she ground her ass back against Jamie�s hips.� They were turning off the main road now, onto
the long drive of the estate.� His prick
thrust in and out viciously slamming Ella against the seat, over and over.� He could hear her breasts slapping against
the leather, and grabbed at them, squeezing them like vices.� Ella didn�t make a sound, though he knew from
her short laboured breathing that she was enjoying
herself.� He could feel the pressure
building up within him now, the smells of leather, sex, and car�s engine,
intoxicating.� A shudder ran through Ella
as she came.� It was almost too easy, at
certain times.� Jamie held on for only a
fraction of a minute longer.� His seed
flooded into her in a hot rush.

The Rolls Royce limo pulled into
the circular drive of the manor house, a sprawling 18th century
limestone masterpiece.� Inside the car
Jamie still clung to Ella, there was no rush, the two could remain undisturbed
as long as they desired, but he was anxious to give her his present.� Their breathing had slowed to an almost
normal pace.� Jamie opened a small
compartment and withdrew a towel, cleaning himself and Ella up.

�Can I take this off now?�� Ella gestured to the blind fold.

She sat facing him now in totally
dishevelment.� �No, not yet,�� He said as he did up his pants and fastened
his belt, then began to button Ella�s shirt and run his fingers through her
wavy hair.� �There, you look quite
presentable.�

�There best not be people
here.�� She wanted nothing but to spend
the week with Jamie, alone.

Jamie could see the butler standing
at the car door, studiously avoiding looking into the blacked out windows.� He knew that the job he had been hired to do
required service with total loyalty and absoutelly no
questioning.� He�d stand outside the car
door all night waiting for the signal to open the door.� Yes, Jamie thought, Barnsley, was a fine hire.� �At that,
he rapped on the window, and Barnsley
opened it.� Jamie unfolded his tall frame
and stepped out of the hot car into the biting chill of December.� He breathed into the air, watching his
breath.� �It was so warm in the car, I�d
forgotten how cold it was outside.�

Barnsley,
who had worked for the family for years and knew exactly what had been going on
behind the glass partition, simply nodded and said, �Quite so m�lord.�

�Yes, well,� Jamie stuck his head
back into the cooling cabin of the car, �Are you coming out Ella?�

�Well, it�s a little difficult as
I�m blindfolded.�
����������� �Here, I�m holding out my
hand.� There you go.� Alright, watch your head.�� Ella�s boots crunched on the gravel drive.� �You�ll see that the bags are taken care
of?�� Jamie shouted over his shoulder as
he drew Ella into the house.

�Of course, m�lord.� Everything has been made ready as always.�

�Excellent, then I doubt you�ll see
us for the rest of the night.�

�Very good, goodnight.�

Jamie left the heavy oak door open
behind him as he pulled Ella along towards the newest addition to the
house.� �Do you know where we�re
headed?�� He asked her.

�The lab,� Ella stated, starting to
become excited.� The Lab, as they called
it, had been built during World War II to serve as a makeshift hospital. �It had been sealed off by the last Lord
Bradford, but Jamie and Ella had reopened the wing and remodled
it to suit their fancies.� They stopped
at the entrance, Jamie placing his thumb against a small scanner.� �You know how close to success we�ve been with
our experiments in nanotech?�� There was
a heavy sound of metal and the door slid open revealing a well lit hallway with
three metal doors on either side and an arched opening ahead.

�Yes,� Ella�s heart had begun to
beat faster.� Behind each of the doors
was a small cell with a bed, a toilet, and a sink.� There were frequently �guests� occupying at
least one of the rooms, but at present, they were all empty.� The nanotech had been the logical progression
in their shared interests.� If the right
programs and combinations were made they would be able to totally reshape a
person into anything they desired.� Jamie
was the scientific mind while Ella was the artist.� But, their experiments had been slow to
progress, enhanced breasts here, a bulging ass there, nothing for the books.

The two stepped through the archway
into an operating gallery of sorts, an operating table in the center, beyond,
through another door, a second room, white, sterile with other doors leading
off it.� Within an old fashioned gynecological
exam table.

�Hello, Ella,� a pleasant woman�s
voice shocked Ella.� She hadn�t expected
anyone to be here.� Ella couldn�t stand
it anymore and ripped the blindfold away.�
She briefly registered where they were, that there was a comatose blond
female strapped to the chair and that another woman in a lab coat stood before
her.

�Happy birthday, my love,� Jamie
said quietly, his breath hot against her ear.�
She knew immediately who the woman was, she�d seen her pictures in
medical journals countless times.� The
attractive woman with choppy shoulder length hair and big blue eyes was none
other than Samantha Ruschen, one of the world�s
leading doctors in the new field of nanotechnology.� It was then that her gaze found its way back
to the unconscious girl, woman, Ella realized, in fact, she thought, a wicked
smile widening on her face, the exact same age as her, down to the day, 26
years old for another 183 days.

Fucking bitch, Ella thought.� There before her was Megan Raneleigh, the blond little whore who�d tormented Ella all
through school, at least until Ella had left at 15, unable to bare the abuse
any longer.� The same Megan that had
shared a birthday with her unpopular classmate, who�d made everyone choose
whose party to go to.� Ella�s parents had
finally just started having small family gatherings.� The same Megan who had blossomed at the age
of 13 and turned every boy�s and some girl�s heads.� Megan had laughed at her in the halls as
she�d walk by, spread vicious rumors, albeit, true, even though Megan herself had
only had suspicions, about her sexual encounters, and even gone so far as to
write a play in which one of the characters was a horrible caricature of
Ella.� The play had been preformed at
assembly one day, much to everyone but Ella�s delight.� When Ella had finally gone to the
headmistress about it, she�d promptly been told that she couldn�t force people
to be Ella�s friends and maybe she ought to seek psychiatric help.� That had been Ella�s last day of school.� 

Later that night she�d been called to
the headmistresse�s office again to be told that her
parents had been killed in a plane crash somewhere over the alps.� Ella had left that night, the co-heir to an
enormous fortune.� And now, here in her
grasp was the very symbol of all that had gone wrong with her life.� She�d fantasized for years of ways to torment
Megan, and here she was, served up to her by the man she loved best in all the
world. Ella turned to Jamie and put her arms around him, �You really are the
very best brother a girl could ever wish for.� ���

entrance, Jamie placing his thumb against a small scanner.� �You know how close to success we�ve been with
our experiments in nanotech?�� There was
a heavy sound of metal and the door slid open revealing a well lit hallway with
three metal doors on either side and an arched opening ahead.

�Yes,� Ella�s heart had begun to
beat faster.� Behind each of the doors
was a small cell with a bed, a toilet, and a sink.� There were frequently �guests� occupying at
least one of the rooms, but at present, they were all empty.� The nanotech had been the logical progression
in their shared interests.� If the right
programs and combinations were made they would be able to totally reshape a
person into anything they desired.� Jamie
was the scientific mind while Ella was the artist.� But, their experiments had been slow to
progress, enhanced breasts here, a bulging ass there, nothing for the books.

The two stepped through the archway
into an operating gallery of sorts, an operating table in the center, beyond,
through another door, a second room, white, sterile with other doors leading
off it.� Within an old fashioned gynecological
exam table.

�Hello, Ella,� a pleasant woman�s
voice shocked Ella.� She hadn�t expected
anyone to be here.� Ella couldn�t stand
it anymore and ripped the blindfold away.�
She briefly registered where they were, that there was a comatose blond
female strapped to the chair and that another woman in a lab coat stood before
her.

�Happy birthday, my love,� Jamie
said quietly, his breath hot against her ear.�
She knew immediately who the woman was, she�d seen her pictures in
medical journals countless times.� The
attractive woman with choppy shoulder length hair and big blue eyes was none
other than Samantha Ruschen, one of the world�s leading doctors in the new
field of nanotechnology.� It was then
that her gaze found its way back to the unconscious girl, woman, Ella realized,
in fact, she thought, a wicked smile widening on her face, the exact same age
as her, down to the day, 26 years old for another 183 days.

Fucking bitch, Ella thought.� There before her was Megan Raneleigh, the
blond little whore who�d tormented Ella all through school, at least until Ella
had left at 15, unable to bare the abuse any longer.� The same Megan that had shared a birthday
with her unpopular classmate, who�d made everyone choose whose party to go
to.� Ella�s parents had finally just
started having small family gatherings.�
The same Megan who had blossomed at the age of 13 and turned every boy�s
and some girl�s heads.� Megan had laughed
at her in the halls as she�d walk by, spread vicious rumors, albeit, true, even
though Megan herself had only had suspicions, about her sexual encounters, and
even gone so far as to write a play in which one of the characters was a
horrible caricature of Ella.� The play
had been preformed at assembly one day, much to everyone but Ella�s
delight.� When Ella had finally gone to
the headmistress about it, she�d promptly been told that she couldn�t force
people to be Ella�s friends and maybe she ought to seek psychiatric help.� That had been Ella�s last day of school.� 

Later that night she�d been called to
the headmistress�s office again to be told that her parents had been killed in
a plane crash somewhere over the alps.�
Ella had left that night, the co-heir to an enormous fortune.� And now, here in her grasp was the very
symbol of all that had gone wrong with her life.� She�d fantasized for years of ways to torment
Megan, and here she was, served up to her by the man she loved best in all the
world. Ella turned to Jamie and put her arms around him, �You really are the
very best brother a girl could ever wish for.�

&nbsp;

PART II

&nbsp;

Ella, Jamie and Sam, as the doctor
had told them to call her, were sitting around a table discussing their course
of action.� Ella was polishing off her
second glass of red wine while the doctor explained her methods.� Ella couldn�t keep her mind on Sam�s voice if
she�d wanted to.� She�d never been one
for details, had always left that up to her older brother, so long as things
got done, she was happy.� Jamie on the
other hand was listening closely to Sam go through the lengthy, technical explanation.� �I don�t mean to be rude,� Ella interjected,
�But, I�m a bit anxious to get on with this.�

Neither Jamie nor Sam seemed phased
by Ella�s bluntness.� �Of course,� Sam
said, �I�m sorry, I tend to get carried away.�
All you need to do is tell me exactly what you want, then I�ll write the
program.� The nanites will be injected
directly into the patient�s bloodstream starting off a reaction that will
totally and irreversibly restructure the patient�s body in any way that you
desire.� Once you�ve given me the
specifics it shouldn�t take me more than a few hours to have everything ready.�

�Will she be asleep or awake for
this?�� Now Ella was paying attention.

�Well, it really doesn�t make a
difference in the outcome, although I must warn you that it can be an extremely
painful and terrifying process, especially on a, shall we say, reluctant,
subject.� But in the end, the decision is
entirely up to you.�

�I want the bitch awake, I want her
to see exactly what is happening to her.��
A tendril of heat was slowly spreading its way through Ella�s body, the
combination of the two glasses of wine, and ensuing vengeance.� Jamie could see the slightly maniacal glint
in her blue eyes; it was always there when his sister was planning
torture.� It made him want to fuck her
right there on the table with the hot blond doctor watching.� �How long will it take,� Ella�s voice snapped
him out of his reverie; for a second there, he�d been picturing her writhing
against the restraints.� �I don�t want
her passing out, you can keep her awake, right?�

�Absolutely, a little adrenaline
will take care of that, and as for the time, well, it just depends on the
amount of restructuring.�

�Perfect.�� Ella for once was detail oriented.� She knew precisely what she wanted to happen to
the pretty Megan.� She gave the doctor
her specifications and left her and Jaime to their work.� 

Three hours later Jamie found Ella
at the stables, just dismounting from her black Andalusian stallion,
Deimos.� �Well,� she questioned impatiently,
�Is she ready?�� 

The sky was blackening around them,
no doubt there�d be rain later, Jamie thought as he handed the reins of his
sister�s horse over to a silent stable-hand.�
�I�m not exactly certain as to what she you are referring to love, but,
we are ready to proceed with our little experiment.�� He took her arm in his as they retraced the
path to the manor.� Freezing rain
beginning to fall as they ducked inside.�
Jamie couldn�t resist pushing Ella against a limestone wall and kissing
her hard and deep as they entered the house.�
�What is it about a woman who�s just been riding?�� He asked her as he took in her flushed
complexion and tousled hair.

�We look as if we�ve just been
wonderfully and thoroughly fucked,� she smiled and chucked him under the
chin.� �Now come on,� Ella said and
pulled him towards the lab.

Megan awoke in a stereotypical
white walled room of unknown whereabouts.�
She realized immediately that saying she was in a �bad� situation, was
an understatement.� She was strapped to
an old gynecological exam chair, her arms strapped down by leather restraints, and
her feet in the stirrups, likewise bound.�
What really scared her though was that she couldn�t feel anything, she
could move, but she was totally numb, that and the fact that sitting in front
of her was an attractive late 30�s blond in a lab coat, regarding her as coolly
as if she saw the same thing everyday.� Megan
tried to speak, but found she couldn�t.�
Her vocal chords were, for the moment, paralyzed.� Sam didn�t go in for the whole screaming
victim thing so much, not really her style.�
Though, she didn�t doubt that the vindictive lady of the manor would
desire the young woman fully functioning when her torture took place.

As if on cue, Jamie and Ella
entered, still arm in arm.� Megan had never
seen the tall, dark-haired man, but there was something familiar about the
gorgeous black clad woman before her.� �Hello,
Megan,� Said the woman.� That voice,
Megan knew instantly.� Ella�s voice had
always had a deep, smoky quality that had always seemed at odds with her round
bespeckled face.� Not any longer, Megan
realized.� The Voice matched up with the
tall voluptuous body rather well now.�
�Hard to believe it�s been eleven years, Megan.� You look very much the same.� Do you know who I am?�� Ella had moved away from Jaime to circle
Megan.

Megan�s head bobbed in
acknowledgement to Ella�s question.� Ella
glanced from Megan to Sam.� �Why the
bloody hell isn�t she talking?�

�I was saving the screaming for
you, hold on.�� Sam shot Jamie a look
before she took a syringe from the operating tray and injected it into the IV
in Megan�s right arm.� Megan felt
tingling all over her body as sensation began to return.

�What am I doing here?� What�s going on?�� Megan choked out in a panicked voice.

�Honestly darling,� Ella grinned,
taking one of Megan�s breasts in her hand, enjoying the smooth warm flesh, her
thumb brushing against the taught nipple, �You were an unexpected present from
my brother here.� You know,� the one I like fuck, as you told the entire
school.�� 

Megan understood then that this was
some long awaited revenge scheme.� �Look,
I was just being a stupid kid.� I�m very
sorry, I know you never slept with your brother.�� Megan was struggling uselessly against her
bonds.

�Oh, no, you were quite correct, my
brother and I fuck as much as possible.��
Ella ran a hand down Jamie�s chest while still looking at Megan.� �There will always be girls like you Megan,
and there will always be sad, pathetic girls like I was, but I�ve changed as
you see.� And now, so will you.�

�You�re insane!� People will notice I�m gone.� They�ll come looking for me!�

�And they�ll honestly think to look
into a girl you tormented years ago?� I
think not.� Everyone knows how very well
adjusted and successful I�ve become since my parent�s death.� No, no one will come for you here.� And after I�m done with you, you won�t want
to leave.�� Ella turned to Sam, �You can
ahead now.�

Same again chose a syringe from the
table, this time though, injecting it directly into Megan�s neck.� Megan felt a hot rush through her body as the
nanites began their work.� �What?� What was that?�� She began to feel a burning in her chest.� She looked down at her round c cup breasts
and was horrified to see them swelling slowly.

Ella�s heart was beginning to beast
faster now as she watched the petite blonde�s adequate breast enlarging.� �Those were nanites, my dear.� They�re programmed to do whatever I desire to do to your body.�

Megan had begun to panic in earnest
now.� Her breasts were growing beyond
normalcy for someone with a slim 5�5� stature.�
She could feel her skin tightening, stretching.� Her breasts drooped onto her stomach, her
aureoles brown and saucer sized, her erect nipples 2 and a half inches
long.� Megan struggled against the
strange pressure building up within her expanded breasts.� �Ugh, please, stop!� I�m sorry, I swear I�ll do anything,
please!�� Tears were running down her
pretty pink cheeks.� Ella would have
enjoyed Jamie taking her from behind as they watched their work in progress,
but she couldn�t stand the thought of Megan seeing her so vulnerable.� 

Megan screamed feeling as if two
hot needles had pierced the tips of her long nipples.� A slow dribble of white liquid escaped as
Megan realized the pressure in her breasts was them filling up with milk.� Oh,
fuck!� She thought, I can�t be pregnant!� This can�t really be happening!� In fact, she wasn�t pregnant, Ella just had a
bit of a lactation fetish.� Ella watched,
absentmindedly licking her lips.� Megan�s
breasts had stopped growing and lay heavily to either side of her navel, leaking
milk, looking out of place against such a firm, tan stomach.� And then Megan felt another flare of pain and
heat, this time just below her bellybutton.�
She would have doubled over if she�d been free to, instead, she had to
watch helplessly as four red bumps appeared, the flesh around them turning pink
and plumping up.� Her rational mind
couldn�t make any sense out of what she was seeing.� She again began to writhe in her restraints,
making Ella wish again to have Jaime�s hot prick inside her sopping cunt.� No, Ella
told herself, I must show control.� 

Even as Megan�s mind tried to
refuse what it saw, she couldn�t deny it.�
The puffy pink flesh had continued to grow, large veins appearing.� The four small nipples had turned pink as
well, growing into thick, long teats.�
�What have you done!�� She kept
repeating as her newly formed udder flopped between her thighs, resting against
her sex.� Prior to passing out, Megan saw
Ella clapping in triumph before the blond doctor approached the tall brunette
from behind and deftly sunk a needle into her neck, Jaime catching her drugged
body as she fell.�

PART III

&nbsp;

Leaving the unconscious Megan to
the Doctor�s staff in the lab, Jamie carried the equally oblivious Ella
upstairs to the bedroom the two shared.�
He�d grown tired and jealous of seeing the woman he loved with other men.� He was a devastatingly handsome man himself with intelligence and money, so, it wasn�t as if
he didn�t have his share of women.� But
Ella was the only one who truly knew him, and vice versa.� Of course, it wasn�t as if he could make a
public claim on her affections, though most in their circle knew of their
relationship; Ella had even made a go at the normal life once, getting engaged
for a short time to a suave investment banker.�
It lasted only until her fianc� cried in front of her for the first time
because he felt Ella wouldn�t open up to him.�
This show of emotion of course sickened Ella, and she broke the
engagement off then and there, which led to more tears and an even more pissed
off Ella.� No, there was no man for her
but Jamie.� 

Upon meeting Dr. Ruschen, Jamie had
decided to take matters into his own hands.�
Ella had become increasingly temperamental and cruel, flaunting her
affairs and conquests in front of her brother.�
That was over now, she�d show him the proper respect from here on
out.� 

He laid her inert body on the
massive antique four poster bed, and began to undress her.� Next to the bed was a bottle of port wine and
two glasses the butler had left for them.�
Jamie took out a gold pillbox from his pants pocket.� Inside was one small white tablet, another
design of Dr. Ruschen�s.� He dropped the
small tablet into one of the glasses and watched it dissolve as the reddish
gold liquid poured over it.� 

Jamie ran his hands over Ella�s
soft white flesh, her clothes in a pile by the bed.� She was murmuring softly in her drugged
state, her body responding to Jamie�s slow caresses.� He left her for a moment, opening the closet
safe and retrieving a locked black case.�
He smiled at the contents as the case flipped open.� Before him were four wrought gold cuffs, each
depicting various scenes of depravity from Greek mythology, a favorite subject
of Ella�s.� The cuffs locked into place
around each wrist and ankle, there was no key, they weren�t meant to come off.� Special golden chains were in the works, but
for the moment, blood red silk cords, to match the bed sheets, would do.� 

His work complete, Jamie took the
time to step back and admire his work.�
Ella�s skin looked an even more startling white against the red silk,
her black hair framing her face; her peaceful countenance in stark contrast to
her spread-eagled, bound form.� Jamie was
thinking how very much he was going to enjoy himself.� 

Ella was coming around now, the
sedative Dr. Ruschen had given her in the lab, wearing off.� Her eyes fluttered open, a lazy smile coming
to her lips at the sight of Jamie standing before her.� Her mind was still a bit hazy from the drugs,
so it took her a few seconds to comprehend that she had somehow been
transported from the lab to the bedroom where she was now nude and tied to the
bed; she saw the silk cords, but these were connected to four golden cuffs
she�d never seen before.� The sight did
little to disturb or surprise her:� Ella
had certainly woken up in more compromising positions than this.

�Well,� she said, �These are new,�
and nodded to the cuffs.

��A gift,� he said, smiling as he unbuttoned
his white dress shirt; his body tan and lean beneath.� �I had them made especially for you.�� His pants and underwear dropped next, leaving
him standing before Ella like Michelangelo�s David.� Though, oddly, Ella noticed, still wearing
his watch.

All thoughts of Megan and the lab
had been forgotten by Ella as all she desired for the moment was Jamie.� There�d be plenty of time later.� �Here,� he said and reached for the glass of
sweet dessert wine, �open up.�� The bed
creaked as he sat down on the edge.

Ella did as she was told, pushing
up on her elbows, tilting her head back to receive the contents Jaime
poured.� One side of his mouth twisted up
in mirth as he watched her swallow the liquid, then lick her lips.� She was being so very obliging, he thought as
he placed the empty glass back on the table.�
�Aren�t you going to have any?��
Ella asked.

�No, not at the moment,� Jamie
answered before straddling Ella.� �There
are some things that we need to discuss.�

Ella let out an irritated breath,
�Jamie, I don�t really think this is the time to be talking, as you�re always
reminding me.�

�My dear, this isn�t your
decision.� In fact, nothing that we do
will ever be your decision again.�� 

A tendril of fear began to go
through Ella.� �What are you talking
about?�

�You, you are a cold, fucking bitch
and it is past time I took you in hand.��
Ella began to tug at her bonds, to no avail; clearly this had gone
beyond simple play.� �With the help of
Dr. Ruschen, I�ve been planning this for months.� When she knocked you out down in the lab, a
microchip was implanted in your brain; one which I control.� Play nice from now on, and I think you�ll
rather enjoy the effects.� Though, she
did warn me that you�ll take a bit of breaking in.�

�Jamie, you wouldn�t, this is
crazy, you love me.�

�You�re right, I do love you.�� He fiddled with his watch, the face sliding
back to reveal one red button and one green.�
�You see, it�s quite simple really, press the green and.� �Ella felt a wave of heat and electricity
course through her body.� She was brought
almost instantly to the brink of orgasm, writhing beneath Jamie, grinding
against his hips and hardening cock.� He
took hold of her waist and shoved her back down into the bed.

�Oh, god!� Jamie!��
She�d never known there could be such maddening ecstasy.� How could this
possibly be a punishment, she wondered.�
If she�d been free, she would have grabbed his cock and shoved it right
up inside her.� She couldn�t understand
why he wasn�t making the move himself.�
�Just fuck me Jamie!�� She could
barely get the words out as she bucked under him, growing furious at his
refusal to grant her release.� He ran his
hands up under her white breasts, squeezing them briefly, and then releasing
them.� Now was not the time.

�Sorry love, Samantha�s waiting for
me across the hall.� A little celebration
fuck in honor of our successful experiments.�

�What!� I�ll fucking kill you!� You can�t leave me like this!�� She was crying now, a fine sheen covered her
body from her futile exertions.� A dark
stain was spreading on the sheets beneath her squirming thighs as her juices
ran from her swollen cunt.� 

Jamie had climbed down off of the
bed and was heading towards the door.�
�Just so you know, you won�t be able to have an
orgasm on your own anymore.� The chip in
your brain is blocking your release until I�ve decided you�ve had enough.� Enjoy.��
And with that, he was out the door, shutting it firmly behind him.

Ella just stared at the heavy oak
door in horror, moans and gasps coming to her unbidden.� Surely a body wasn�t meant to withstand such
strain, nor a mind.� Much more of this
and she knew she�d go insane.

Across the hall,
Dr. Samantha Ruschen, looked up from her notes as Jamie entered.� �Well,� Sam said with an appreciative tone as
she took in the sight of the nude 6�2�, broad shouldered, and erect, sight
before her.� The doctor had showered
after leaving the lab and was now clad in a long white terry cloth robe.� Not really an exotic enough tableau for
Jamie�s usual standards, but at the moment it didn�t matter.� Sam strode towards him, a smile on her pretty
face.� �You know, this house is amazingly
quiet, I was disappointed that I couldn�t hear a thing going on across the
way.�

Jamie reached out and untied the
robe, revealing a tan perfectly sculpted body; none of the softness he so loved
in Ella.� He cupped Sam�s 38 C breasts,
his thumbs brushing across the dusky nipples.�
�My mother made the house like that.�
Every room is virtually sound proof.�
She couldn�t stand loud noises, nor did she want my father knowing what
happened behind closed doors.�� Sam
raised an eyebrow at this.� �She simply
enjoyed using the servants as she desired.�
Ella and I once happened upon her and our nanny.� Poor Kate was naked, bound and gagged while
our mother whipped her.�� Jamie pinched
one of Sam�s nipples, making her gasp, �So, you see, my sister and I come by
our tastes quite naturally.�

�You wish you were with her right
now, Ella, I mean.�

�Yes, it took all I had to leave
her in that state.�

�As I told you, it takes some time
for the treatment to take full effect.�
It has to counteract the birth control as well as throw her cycle into a
forced period of fertility.� Though
afterwards, it will be nigh on impossible not to get her pregnant.�� Sam glanced at Jamie�s erect cock, �For the
moment, I would be remiss not to give you some relief.�� She lowered herself to her knees and took
Jaime�s prick in her mouth, her tongue moving from the base to the head in a
swirling motion.� She licked at the
throbbing head, tongue sucking at the opening.�
His hand tangled in her thick honey colored hair, his grip tightening,
forcing her to take more of him in.� She
was using just the right amount of teeth, one hand massaging his balls while
the other clung to his firm ass.� It
didn�t take long for him to come.� Sam
could feel the pressure in Jamie building and swallowed the hot salty liquid as
it shot into her mouth.� She looked up at
him, a dribble of the stuff on her lip. He wiped it with his thumb, and then
offered it to her.� Sam licked
cooperatively, then kissed his thumb and stood, re-tying her robe. 

�Why don�t you go get some food or
take a shower, or something, while I go check on her,� Sam said.� �I�ll let you know when she�s ready.� It shouldn�t be too much longer.�

�Right,� he said, and stalked off
in search of a quick bite and a robe.

Sam smiled and shook her head, not
quite sure what she had gotten herself into with this job.� She�d met Jamie six months ago at a party in Prague when he�d
approached her about her work in the field of nanotech.� Once she had realized the exact nature of his
interest, the two had become fast friends.�
She did her share of legit work, but the real money, and the real fun,
came from her not so legal private jobs, such as this one.� Now that she�d taken care of the lord of the
manor, it was time to see to the lady.�
She dressed quickly, jeans and a t-shirt, brushed her teeth, ran a brush
through her hair, and entered into the master bedroom. 

It was quite a scene, the antique
bed, the red silk sheets, the gorgeous woman moaning and struggling exhaustedly
against her bonds.� Sam was reminded of a
painting by Chasseriau, of the princess Andromeda, naked and chained to a rock,
awaiting the Kraken.� 

Ella, for her part could no longer
think clearly, her sole desire and need was to reach the climax which was now
beyond her.� Sam knew the waves of
arousal had not lessened, though Ella�s movements had become sluggish, it was
only that Ella�s body in truth couldn�t stand much more.� Sam almost felt sorry for her; Ella looked so
much younger now as she lay whimpering, the tears rolling down her cheeks, her
already full lips puffed up from the crying.�
She looked almost like an innocent.�
Almost.

Sam approached the bed and leaned
over Ella, �What�s that?� I�m afraid
you�re not making much sense.�

There was no hint of the former
haughtiness as she begged the doctor, �Please, please make it stop, I�ll do
anything.�� 

�It seems I�ve heard that before
somewhere.�� Sam knew the change in
attitude wasn�t permanent.� Ella would
revert almost to her former self eventually, but she�d always have the threat
and memory of this night to keep her in check.�
�I�m afraid Ella, that I can�t do a thing for
you, you�ll have to wait for your brother.��
Sam had brought her small black doctor�s bag with her, and she opened it
now, bringing out a stethoscope and blood pressure monitor.� She placed the earpieces into her ears then
placed the cold metal against Ella�s chest.

�Wh, what
are you doing?�� Ella managed to get out.

Sam continued to listen for a few
more seconds, pleased with the results, nothing out of the ordinary.� She then placed the cuff of the monitor
around Ella�s upper arm, the stethoscope at the hollow of her elbow.� Sam pumped a few times, then released, again
satisfied that everything was as it should be, despite Ella�s current state.

�Why aren�t you answering me?�� Ella kept having flashes of Megan�s terrified
face as the girl realized a cow�s udder was bursting forth from her belly.� Jamie couldn�t possibly be that mad, could
he?� No, surely he wouldn�t ruin the
beauty he helped so to cultivate.� 

�She�s just making sure
everything�s in order,� Jamie answered from the door.� �You�re going to be a mother.�

Ella blanched and dry heaved.� Jamie knew there was nothing Ella feared more
than pregnancy.� They�d both watched
their mother almost die from a miscarriage when they were children.� Perhaps it was that experience, or maybe she
found something about the loss of control terrifying; either way, Ella had
always sworn she�d never have children.� 

Sam looked at her watch and then to
Jamie, �She�s ready,� Sam said and retreated to a chair in the corner of the
room.� Normally she would have given the
two their privacy, however, due to Jamie�s special request, her continued
presence was required.

�Jamie, no, please you can�t do
this to me, not this!� Please.�� But, even as she said it Ella knew there was
no use.� She was so tired from her
struggles.� A sob escaped her swollen lips
as Jamie disrobed, his prick ready to give her the
release she so desperately desired.� She
knew she couldn�t refuse him if it meant an end to this torment.

�Don�t worry,� he said, leaning
down to kiss her and brush an errant curl from her face.� �Everything�s going to be fine.� I love you.�
I�ll never let anything happen to you.��
He was on top of her now, kissing her breasts, positioning himself to
enter her sopping wet slit.� He glanced
at Sam, who nodded, and then he thrust hard and deep into Ella.� She began to buck wildly beneath him, moaning
and sobbing, she just kept saying, please, please.� 

Ella could no longer discern
pleasure from pain; all were wrapped into one body racking sensation as Jamie
continued driving into her.� He stopped
just long enough to push the red button on his watch.� Ella could feel herself finally,
blessedly tip over the edge of orgasm.�
Her body shuddered one last time, her thighs tightening, her muscles
constricting, trying to pull even more of him into herself.� And with a cry of ecstasy, Ella came harder
than she�d ever imagined was possible.�
She tried to look at Jamie�s face as he plunged into her, but her vision
was going black as a pain shot through her skull and everything went dark.

Jamie for his part,
continued the pistoning motion, feeling himself ready to come.� With one last push, he forced himself in up
to the hilt and released a flood of seed into Ella�s prone body.� He collapsed on the bed next to her, laying still for a moment before noticing that Ella was out.� �Sam, she�s not moving!�

Sam advanced towards the bed.� She looked Ella over for a second then
slapped her hard across the face.� This
brought Ella to, �You bitch!�� She yelled
at Sam.

�Come now Ella,� Jamie said, �You
shouldn�t speak to the good Doctor in such a way.� Apologize.�

Ella�s glare burned through her
brother, �Why exactly should I do that?�

Jamie tapped his watch, �Do we
really need to go over this again?�

Ella swallowed the bile that had
risen in the back of her throat.� �No,
I�m sorry, I��� At that moment she felt a
gut wrenching pain flash through her breasts and belly.� �What? Aaa!�� Her terrified eyes fixed on Jamie.

�Well,� Sam said, �It looks as if
she�s conceived.�

Ella�s eyes darted back and forth
between Jamie and Sam.� �Oh,� said Jamie,
�I forgot to warn you that certain physical aspects of your pregnancy have been
accelerated.� Our child will grow at a
normal rate, but you won�t.�

She felt a sickening pressure
building within her body, but she was too exhausted to fight it or him. �Whatever was happening to her was out of her
hands.� Of course, that didn�t stop a
fresh flood of tears from welling up.�
She wept silently, still bound by the silk ropes, watching and feeling
her body change.� Her back arched as her
breasts began to grow, heat emanating from the expanding flesh.� The silent tears became loud moans of rapture
as her ass and heels ground into the mattress, struggling against the throbbing
heat between her legs.� The sensation
might have been enough to make her wet, as she was now, but it didn�t make the
situation any less terrifying.� Perhaps,
even more so, as she couldn�t help but writhe in ecstasy despite her growing
body.� Her breasts were now at least a
very full D with blue veins clearly etched beneath the porcelain skin.� She splayed her thighs wide open, thrusting
her hips, undulating as her belly began to visibly swell.� She was becoming so round.� Her increased girth causing
the bed to creak.� 

Jamie was watching from the foot of
the bed, immensely pleased with himself.� He was already hard again.� Ella�s breasts now looked like soft white
melons with dark nipples, each with their first droplets of milk beginning to
dribble out.� Her belly had stretched
itself to that of a woman nine months gone in pregnancy, even her bellybutton
had popped out.� Ella raised her head to
look at Jamie over her new mounds of flesh.�
�Jamie?�

He sat on the bed beside her,
running his hands over her smooth white skin, exploring every new hill and
crevice, loving the firmness and weight of her milk filled breasts, knowing
that soon they�d become so engorged that Ella would once again be in pain and
begging for his mercy.� His hand paused
on her round belly, gently caressing it, knowing that their child was growing
within.� He�d never wanted her more in
his life, she was exquisite in her gravid state, he�d
have to keep her like this, have a dozen little bastards.� Jamie reached behind Ella�s head and pressed
a button to the wall.� He knew that in
response, his sister�s pretty red-headed maid, Lizzie, would appear.� The twenty year old servant had already been
given strict instructions by Jamie, and he could tell that she was going to
enjoy her new position of dominance over her mistress.

For the present, Jamie would take a
hot shower and fuck Sam till the sun came up.�
Ella�s attitude still needed some improving, and he thought it best if
she suffered through the night alone.�
Lizzie had been told to change the sheets, give Ella a sponge bath and
some food, but under no circumstances were Ella�s breasts to be touched.� Jamie wanted Ella begging to be milked in the
morning.� Maybe he take her down to the
lab to be milked, maybe he�d let Megan watch, or maybe he�d let Ella milk Megan
and then vice versa.� The possibilities
were endless.
