Synopsis: Master's angel slave requires some discipline when she decides to go against His wishes.The phone rang. It was Him, on His way home from work. He'd given me a key earlier
  in the week, as we had planned on my coming to stay Friday night. He wanted
  me to be there, waiting for Him when He arrived. I picked up the phone in silence. 
�My angel slave�, He said, �You are there, waiting for Me, just as I asked.
  Good girl.� 
A soft smile stretched across my face. His praise was all I ever sought and
  what made me the happiest, and He knew so. I said nothing at all; just waited
  for my instructions. 
�I should be there in about an hour. When I arrive, I want you to be prepared
  for Me. Listen carefully. You are to be shaved completely bare for Me, smelling
  sweet like you always are; wearing your corset and garter belt, no panties,
  I want you to be able to present your pussy to Me whenever I ask. Also, your
  thigh high fishnets and heels, and the beautiful collar I got for you. It's
  in My top dresser drawer. Make sure you only look in the top dresser drawer;
  there is no need for you to look in any others. If you do, I will know, so
  don't be mischievous, do you understand? As soon as you have prepared yourself,
  kneel by the front door in the welcoming pose I've taught you and wait for
  Me. Be a good little angel slave for Me. Make Me happy. I will see you soon.� 
An hour, I only had an hour, to be perfect for Him; to be ready for Him. My
  mind was swimming trying to remember what I was to do, everything clouded by
  my excitement. �Okay, I have to get it together�, I thought to myself. Pleasing
  my wonderful Sir was all that mattered to me from the moment that phone rang,
  and I knew I would be well rewarded if I pleased Him. 
I went to the bathroom and ran a bubble bath. He'd restricted me from shaving
  myself all week. He knew how uncomfortable I would be, and each time I felt
  that little irritating itch I'd think of Him and all the other beautiful discomforts
  that awaited me once I would see Him again. In a way also, it was almost a
  form of chastity. There would be no one else that I would ever need to be prepared
  for again but Him. 
I shaved carefully and meticulously, every second thinking of how amazing
  it would feel to have His hand slide so effortlessly over my soft, slick skin.
  Especially after not having shaved for a week, I felt even more vulnerable
  and knew that, once He laid eyes on me, the feeling of being exposed like that
  for Him , with only just my garter belt and fishnets, would only amplify the
  way that He was able to make me feel helpless for only Him. 
After getting out of the bath, I smoothed my favorite vanilla lotion that
  I always wore from head to toe. I then ran to Sir's bedroom where my bag was,
  quickly dressed, took out my black high heels, strapped them on my perfectly
  pedicured feet and sat on the edge of the bed, wondering what I was to do next.
  I glanced at the clock on the bedside table. Nearly forty minutes had passed
  since I'd hung up the phone. Sir was a man of His word, and He had said He'd
  be home in about an hour. That didn't leave me much time. I wanted to be flawlessly
  posed for Him at the door when he arrived, but I knew I was missing something. 
I went over the phone conversation again in my head. The collar! My beautiful
  collar! How could I ever forget? I couldn't blame myself too much. Just the
  thought of the man I longed to be my Master sent me into a mental whirlwind.
  I just needed to focus. And then I remembered what He had said. �It's in My
  top dresser drawer. Make sure you only look in the top dresser drawer; there
  is no need for you to look in any others. If you do, I will know, so don't
  be mischievous, do you understand?� 
Of course I understood completely. However, curiosity and naughtiness combined
  got the best of me, as it usually does. I was dying to take just a peek in
  some of the other drawers. Was there a surprise for me? Or was He just trying
  to impose some silly guideline to get me to bend to His will? I had to know. 
Slowly, so as to not leave a detectable sign behind, I slid open the second
  drawer. Ever so carefully I lifted up some of the clothing to see if there
  was anything underneath, but there was nothing. Just as slowly and carefully
  as I'd opened it, I closed it right back. My heart was racing, knowing that
  I'd disobeyed. �Eh�, I thought, �I've done no real harm and I was careful.
  He'll not know. I just best get to my task at hand and not worry with this
  anymore.� So, I opened the top drawer and found my gorgeous collar, right where
  He told me it would be. I slipped it around my throat and buckled it up tight.
  I took a quick glance in the mirror, for that was all I had time for, and began
  to feel the rapid thump of my heart, as the excitement rose. I quickly rushed
  to the door and assumed my pose; on my knees with my feet tucked under my behind,
  bent over with perfect posture, head down, my hair sprawled across my shoulders
  and arms, which were extended toward the door, palms face up. 
And I waited� 
It seemed like nearly a half hour had passed, yet I'm sure it was only a few
  minutes. I could just hardly wait. Aside from that quick poke into the second
  dresser drawer, which I wasn't all too concerned with, I knew that I would
  be there, complete and perfect, and ready to be used by Him. And then, finally,
  I heard the key turn in the lock. My stomach flipped, much like it does at
  the top of the first hill of a roller coaster, and I hurriedly checked myself
  to be sure my pose was faultless, just as He had taught me. 
I did not look up, for I was never allowed to look my Sir in the eyes without
  permission first. But I did feel His presence growing nearer. At last, a pat
  on the head and His breathtaking voice� 
�My sweet angel slave, what a good girl you are. You look absolutely perfect.
  I am so pleased. You may raise your head and look at Me; I know you are dying
  to�, He said with a grin. 
And so, after adoringly kissing the toes of both of His shoes, I did. And
  the flash of utter adulation filled my heart. My Sir; He was here at last.
  I knew He could see it in my eyes, how I revered Him. He smiled at me. 
�Come�, He said, �follow me into the bedroom.� 
I rose gracefully and followed Him, two steps behind. �How will He have me
  to serve Him first?� I excitedly wondered, at the same time hoping I was surreptitious
  enough to have left no indication of my snooping. I knew I'd been bad, but
  figured it was so minor an infraction that it would go unnoticed. After all,
  I didn't search through the entire dresser, I'd merely peered into one single
  drawer for only just a second, and I'd not seen anything that I wasn't meant
  to see. If He had not tempted me the way He did, I'd have never had the thought
  to do even that. 
�Stand here My perfect angel slave�, He instructed me happily, �near the dresser.
  I want your posture to be impeccable and your arms outstretched in front of
  you. That way, you can hold My clothes as I select them. You will be the most
  gorgeous valet ever. And I want you to stay just like that until I get out
  of the shower and I'm ready to get dressed.� 
�Yes, Sir�, I said with a smile. I was eager to do anything that would please
  Him. I was just happy that He was there, allowing me to serve Him, to be a
  loving, adoring slave to Him. And I also knew that the sooner He was out of
  the shower and comfortable in His silk pajama pants, the sooner it would be
  that He would possibly allow me to touch Him, maybe even embrace Him and kiss
  Him. My heart skipped a beat at the thought. I assumed my position as He turned
  to the dresser with a smile�a smile that quickly faded as He opened that damned
  second drawer. 
�Slave, you have disobeyed Me�, He said in a very disappointed tone. 
How could He know? 
�I specifically instructed you NOT to go into any drawer besides the top one,
  and I know that you did exactly the opposite, didn't you?� He demanded of me. 
�Yes, Sir,� I said, with my head now bent low in embarrassment and shame. �But
  I just couldn't help myself. My inquisitiveness got the best of me, Sir. I
  am so sorry. I would never mean to displease You. I only opened it for a second
  and then closed it right back up because I knew I was being bad. Please forgive
  me!� I pleaded as I sunk down to my knees and hugged his legs, silent now,
  because I knew I'd said too much already , asking for His mercy. 
�Yes, on your knees, you awful little girl, that is right where you belong,� His
  voice boomed. �I am ashamed of you and wonder now if you will ever be worthy
  of calling Me your Master. I do not wish to have My slave behave as rebellious
  as you and I have a mind to take that collar away!� 
Tears welled up in my eyes. I knew, at this point, all there was for me to
  do was prove to Him that, despite my defiant streak, there was nothing more
  in this world that I wanted other than to be His. 
�I'm sorry My poor, misbehaved angel slave, I would never take away your collar.
  By giving that to you, My commitment to you is secured. But so is My commitment
  to training you and teaching you the err of your ways. So, rather than have
  the honor of presenting My clothes to Me when I am ready for them, you are
  to kneel in that corner until I say you are redeemed,� He said, pointing to
  where He wished for me to carry out my sentence. �Now crawl!� 
As He demanded, I crawled, like the naughty pet that I was, to where He had
  pointed. I knelt there, mentally kicking myself, for now, after all this waiting,
  I'd been banished to this corner, where I could not even have the pleasure
  of looking at my Sir; the worst punishment of all; and just because I couldn't
  follow one simple instruction. 
I could hear Him shuffling through His dresser, then tossing His clothes onto
  the bed. Before He went into the bathroom I felt His voice turn my way saying, �No
  pouting; you need to look pretty for Me in that corner. I want your back straight
  and your shoulders back; knees far apart, hands behind your back and your chin
  up.� I quickly adjusted myself to His specifications. �That's right. It seems
  you are well trained, yet� you always seem to find trouble for yourself. I
  don't get it. In any case, stay beautiful for Me, just like that. Don't get
  lazy, I'll be back.� Oh, how I wished I was standing there, presenting myself
  and His clothing to Him when He was ready. But now here I was in this corner,
  and His clothes were on the bed. I could hear Him turn on the shower and close
  the curtain. 
In the desperate attempt to demonstrate my loyalty, despite my slip, I knelt
  in that corner with the most unblemished posture and waited patiently for His
  acknowledgement. Finally, I got it. 
Suddenly, I felt the swift blow of His hand across my ass. I must have let
  my mind drift off, meditating on my stance, because I did not even hear Him
  get out of the shower and come up from behind me. As quickly as I was smacked,
  I sat down fast on my heels, out of natural response, no longer minding my
  perfect posture. 
�Oh, I don't think so, slave,� He said, as He yanked me back up by my hair, �you
  will remain in that beautiful pose while I whip you for being such a bad, bad
  girl.� 
He kept his grip on my hair, holding me up high on my knees, my back and neck
  pulled taught and straight, as He bent over to inflict His punishment upon
  me. I wanted so badly to reach down and protect myself yet, because of my admiration
  and devotion; because I trusted Him to do what was right and best for me, my
  hands remained behind my back and far out of the way of the spankings that
  were reddening and welting my ass. As much as it was painful, I felt good in
  knowing that it would please Him for me to take the punishment that I had so
  childishly asked for and teach me my lesson. I would never again discount an
  instruction from Him, no matter how petty I thought it to be. And when He was
  satisfied, He released the grip He had on my hair and I slid slowly to the
  floor, in a flood of tears. 
�Look up at Me, My sweet angel slave,� I heard Him say softly, surprisingly
  close. 
I looked up and saw Him there, kneeling right along side me, on the floor,
  in that corner. Blinking the tears away, I begged Him with my eyes to hold
  me and comfort me. He, of course, read me without any difficulty, and firmly
  placed His arms around me and whispered in my ear, �Your punishment is over.
  You will be a good girl for Me now. And we can put this behind us? I want to
  know that you have learned from this. I know what you were thinking, but I
  do not give you instructions out of a silly desire to just see what you will
  do for Me. I instruct you out of purpose. And the purpose here was to show
  you that you are not in the position to do as you wish. You are Mine, and you
  will do as you are told. In return, I will never ask of you anything that you
  are unable to endure; I will always care for you, always attend to your every
  need, and pamper you to no end. But you have to be a good girl for Me and put
  aside all of your curiosities and rebelliousness.� 
�Yes, Sir�, was all there was to say. And I embraced Him back and thanked
  Him for showing me the way. 
�Now, for being such a good girl and taking the punishment you knew you deserved,
  I will reward you, to show you that I am fair,� He said. �Reassume your position
  please; just as pretty as you were before.� And He stood to give me room, and
  to observe. 
I did just as He asked. I rose up completely on my knees and straightened
  my body; threw back my shoulders and raised my chin. I spread my knees apart,
  beautifully wide, and quickly wiped my cheeks free of tears before grasping
  my hands behind my back. 
�Perfect, just as before. It was so difficult for Me to deliver your penalty.
  I would have much rather come in here from the shower, undraped My clothing
  from your pretty arms, gotten dressed and played with you for a while before
  dinner. There are so many things I'd like to do to you� make you My toy,� He
  said as my stomach, once again, began to form knots of pleasant anxiousness. 
He came up from behind me once again, this time not to punish me, but to pleasure
  me. �I love to see that blissful look on your face when I am near you; how
  you shudder under a whisper of My touch,� He said, as His finger slowly found
  its way to my bare, spread pussy. �And I love that you are dripping wet for
  Me, just at the sound of My voice.� 
He then grabbed both my wrists into one hand and guided me to stand. I walked
  with Him, straight to the corner of the bed, as if I knew exactly what was
  in His mind and where He wanted me to go. Once there, He forcefully bent me
  over that corner of the bed until my knees naturally collapsed in order to
  accommodate my top half and head lying flat on the mattress; my ass so near
  the edge of that corner that I could totally sense how exposed I was to Him.
  For a moment I felt very awkward, until my weight was evenly distributed by
  Him stretching each leg out as far as it would reach to its' respective nearest
  corner and affixing it by the ankle with rope to the post of the frame, being
  sure that my toes were perfectly pointed. 
My naked pussy was stretched open even farther when He commanded me to arch
  my back and place my hands behind me, elbows bent up high so that I was grasping
  each with the other hand. All of my attention was focused on my uncovered,
  wet pussy, and wondering what He was planning. �Stay,� He commanded. 
Thankfully my head was turned in the right position to see where He was going
  and what He was doing. He walked over to the dresser and opened the third drawer.
  Out He pulled a perfectly sized black ball gag, designed simply of leather
  and a shiny silver buckle. And then, something else; a noose looped out of
  thick soft rope. These were what I was not meant to see. They were meant to
  be a surprise. What a lucky girl I was; to still receive her surprises. No
  matter how harshly He ever punished me, He was never able to keep from showering
  me with loving attention, always making me aware that I am, and will always
  be, the constant focus of His dark thoughts and sinister desires. 
My heart skipped and pounded as He walked back over to me, slipped the ball
  gag into my mouth, buckled it snugly, and, without any pause at all, slid my
  head through the loop in the noose and adjusted it firmly around my neck; taking
  the end into His fist and standing right up behind me, so closely that I could
  feel the tip of His cock tickling my drenched hole. From behind the ball gag
  I begged Him to enter me, to just crash Himself into me and fuck me hard. Instead,
  He teased me for a few moments, pinching and twisting my hard clit. But all
  I wanted was Him inside me now, and so I continued to plead for His cock. 
�Yes, My beautiful angel slave, you may have Me now,� He said, as He thrust
  Himself into me. Again and again and again He forced His way deeper and deeper
  into me; each time pulling tighter on the noose with one hand, grasping both
  my forearms with the other. 
He took me to the point of near ecstasy as the pressure from the noose did
  its proper job. I was slipping slowly through a tunnel of utter bliss, transcendent
  for just that moment, until He released the rope, which loosened the noose
  just enough to start bringing my mind slowly back to that bedroom; right at
  that perfect instant of perfect release for us both. 
�My dear, dear angel slave,� He then said dejectedly, �you did not ask My
  permission to cum.� 
To be continued�����.. : )
