Her hands
caress the marks, bright red against her skin, and thinks of him. Wonders where
he is, what he�s doing, is he thinking of her at all? At this last she shakes her
head to clear it and stands.

&nbsp;

What does
it matter? He�s hundreds of miles away at the very least, and she has no idea
when she�ll see him again.

&nbsp;

If ever,
the cynical part of her mind adds. She pushes the thought away and forces
herself to dress for the day. Every day, without fail, she stands in front of
the full-length mirror in the vanity area and thinks about what she has to do
that day and what should she wear that he would enjoy. Today is fairly easy:
she has a job interview. Easy to choose the skirt, just above the knee. Easy to
choose the sweater, low-cut without being whorish. Easy to forego panties. Easy
to roll the stockings � real stockings, not pantyhose � up her legs and step
into the 3-inch heels. 

&nbsp;

She doesn�t
wear makeup as a general rule, but for days like this, for job interviews, she
will at least wear lipstick. She wields the curling iron like a weapon,
preparing for the battle that will be the interview. With her hair up, she
looks like a librarian. With it down, she looks like someone a lot less
intelligent. Can�t win, she sighs, and leaves her hair down. If she can get
through this meeting without twirling it, it might just work. Final touches:
contacts, silver hoop earrings, watch.

&nbsp;

One last
look in the mirror before she leaves the apartment; it will have to do, she
decides, and goes downstairs. The drive to the nondescript office building is
blessedly short, all the better to not brood on the mistakes she might make.
Day after day she goes out looking for jobs, and day after day she is told she is
by turns overqualified, underqualified, too aggressive, not aggressive enough.
It is wearing on her psyche, making her think she isn�t good enough, that no
one wants her for any reason.

&nbsp;

Logically
she knows that�s not true, but she keeps all her fears to herself, afraid
people will jump to the worst conclusions if they know she isn�t as together as
they think. She picks up her purse and folio and heads into the building,
checks in at the receptionist�s desk. She�s early, of course, early enough that
the interviewer hasn�t yet arrived for the morning.

&nbsp;

She decides
to freshen up in the ladies� room; it�s really just an excuse to trace those
welts on her breast again, to indulge in a couple moments thinking of him
before reality interferes, intrudes. Those marks, those welts remind her who
she is, who she is to him. She lifts her skirt, one hand holding it up while
the other strokes her pussy. Relax, she thinks. Relax, it�s just another idiot
interviewer who will look down your sweater, refuse to meet your eyes, thinks
your talent is stuck in your breasts and not your mind. She dips a finger
inside, not terribly surprised to find that she�s quite wet. She�s in a
perpetual state of arousal anymore; she knows he knows and is pleased, even if
he can�t be there to take advantage of the situation � to tease, torment, and
finally (hopefully) fuck her. 

&nbsp;

She pulls
her skirt back down, slowly licks her finger clean, and heads back out to
reception. The interviewer is apparently unthrilled that she�s there early.
It�s only twenty minutes early, she thinks. Late, as far as she�s concerned,
but strike one against her even before the interview begins. It�s nearly enough
to make her consider getting up and walking out, but she needs a job too badly.
So she sits, reading and re-reading her resume to herself as she has dozens of
times before.

&nbsp;

Finally the
receptionist takes her back to a meeting room to wait some more. The
interviewer will be with her shortly, the receptionist tells her. Yippee
fucking skippee, she thinks. Not an ideal attitude to go into this with, she
knows, but at this point she�s simply tired of the job hunting process. 

&nbsp;

Ten minutes
go by, then fifteen. Now the interviewer is late, and she is extremely annoyed.
Has she wasted her time here when she could be somewhere else? Somewhere she
can be alone and make herself cum. Somewhere she could work on the tasks he set
for her this week. Somewhere she can do something that connects her to him. 

&nbsp;

At the twenty
minute mark, she decides the interviewer is just playing one of those fun
interview games, one where they try to force the interviewee into being
antagonistic. Screw that, she thinks, and stubbornly refuses to play the game.
She conjures him in her mind, his face, his body, his smell, his touch . . .
the list is endless. She closes her eyes and smiles. Silly, really, how just
the thought of him can calm her. 

&nbsp;

Thirty
minutes. Should she go get someone, she wonders? She decides against it, and
instead traces those marks through her sweater and bra. 

&nbsp;

Forty
minutes, and she decides she might as well remove the bra. It�s not like the interviewer
would notice anything above or below her chest anyway, and the bra is
constricting against her ribcage. She reaches under her sweater, unclasps the
bra, shrugs it off and places it in her purse, thankful she carries a life-size
purse instead of one of those itty-bitty bags. Much better. One hand
automatically continues to sketch the shadow of those marks on her breast,
separated only by the sweater. She can feel her nipples harden, most definitely
a reaction to her thoughts, the marks � oh especially the marks. 

&nbsp;

She looks
at her watch, almost not interested in how long she�s been left in this meeting
room. Forty-five minutes past her appointment time. Ah well, she thinks. I can
take a hint when it�s writ as large as this one. But rather than leave, she
turns sideways in her chair so she can put her legs on the chair next to her. Her
legs are lewdly splayed, her skirt hiked up to her hips. She�s pretty certain
she�s lost the job, so she turns her attention back to him. She thinks of the
last time she felt his hands on her body and realizes it�s been months. Months
since she felt his lash on her breasts, felt his hands on hers following her
movements as she masturbated for him, felt his lips on hers. 

&nbsp;

The door to
the meeting room finally opens, but she�s utterly unaware, lost in her own
world. He steps into the room, assesses the situation and closes the door. A
smile crosses his face as he watches her touch herself, one hand still tracing
the marks on her breast, the other teasing her pussy. Her eyes are closed;
she�s completely lost in her thoughts, her reverie. She hasn�t noticed that
he�s in the room, that he�s watching her intently. 

&nbsp;

He crosses
the room so he�s behind her, watching her push her skirt higher and her sweater
lower as her breathing becomes ragged. She�s close to the edge, close enough
that when he puts his hand on hers and strokes the marks he made on her body,
her soul, she orgasms quickly. He puts his mouth close to her ear and whispers
one word � lovely.

She removes
the rubber bands from her breasts and looks at the marks left behind. Her hands
caress those marks, bright red against her skin, and she thinks of him. Wonders
where he is, what he�s doing, is he thinking of her at all? At this last she shakes
