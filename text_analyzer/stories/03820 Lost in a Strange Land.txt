Synopsis: Claire's family is lost in the tsunami that devestates Thailand.  She returns to Bangkok, but adventure follows her along the way.
Chapter 1 - Lost

	

	Claire still desperately clung to the telephone pole as the water
continued to recede into the sea.  Her family vacation had been wonderful until
today when the chaos erupted.  As she looked around her all that she witnessed
was devastation.  It was like god came out of the ocean and simply swallowed up
the resort town.  Part of the hotel that she had been staying at with her
parents was completely destroyed, its remnants swallowed up by the sea.

	That was when it hit her.  Her parents, where were they?  The last thing
she remembered all three of them had been running from the wall of water that
approached like a speeding train.  Her parents had been behind her, but as she
looked in that direction, she saw nothing.  Virtually everything that had once
been there, tables, chairs even the stone wall that surrounded the swimming pool
were gone, only rubble remained.

	As the terrible realization began to hit her of what had happened,
Claire let go of the pole and fell to her knees, tears rolling down her
cheeks...

	

	The next day passed like a whirlwind.  Claire spent it looking for her
family and trying to find any personal effects that may have survived the wave
of death.  However, she had no luck with either task.  It seemed like only
yesterday that her family was laughing and enjoying a calm day on the beach, a
break from the busy life of Bangkok.  Her father had been sent here three years
ago by his company to set up a new office.  During that time, Claire had gone to
a private school with both international and Thai students.  This was her senior
year and at 18, Claire had looked forward to attending college in the United
States.

	Now, however, it seemed like everything had been lost in the blink of an
eye.  Her parents were missing, and everything that she had brought to the
resort town had been lost in the wave of water.  It was all gone.  All that she
had left was the slightly torn lavender sundress she had been wearing and a few
Thai Bahts.  While she realized that there was still some hope that her parents
had survived the tsunami, Claire knew that her best course of action would be to
go the American embassy in Bangkok and contact her extended family in the
States.

	The Thai relief workers had slowly begun to trickle into the area.  It
was only one day since the calamity and most of the world had not yet realized
how terrible the destruction had been.  Fortunately, Claire found a tent that
had been set up where a relief worker appeared to speak English.  "Please Sir,"
she asked, "Do you speak English?"

	"Yes Miss.  Are you alright?  Have you been injured in anyway?"

	Claire felt relief for the first time since her ordeal had begun. "I am
alright Sir, but my parents..." she could barely choke out the words, "my
parents are missing.  I am not sure where they are or what has happened to
them."

	The man paused; he could see the anguish in the young girl's eyes.  He
had seen it countless times today, but he still could not get used to it.  He
pulled out a form and handed it to Claire and also pulled out a list.  "Please
sign this form Miss.  It is verification that you are alive and will be sent to
your embassy.  Please place your name, age and nationality.  Also though I know
it is hard, please place the names of the people who are missing on this list. 
We are using it to track and find those who were lost in the tsunami.  If we
find out any information, it will help us find you and notify the appropriate
authorities."

	"Thank you Sir," Claire said.  "I was wondering if it would be possible
to get transportation to Bangkok.  I would like to go to the US Embassy and
contact my family."

	"Yes Miss, there is a truck heading there today.  I am afraid it is not
the most comfortable journey, but if you are interested, you are more then
welcome to travel with them.  Also if you go talk to that girl over there, she
can get you some food and some clothing."

	"Thank you Sir."

	

	The road to Bangkok was bumpy and the truck that Claire was riding in
was hot and uncomfortable.  Thankfully it was at least covered from the hot sun
which seared the desolate landscape.  Claire had never really had the
opportunity to visit the Thai countryside.  Most of her time had been spent in
school or in Bangkok with the occasional visit to a resort for a vacation.  In a
way it had been an adventure, though that hardly managed to take care of her
grief and despair.

	At least things seemed to be improving.  The aid station had provided
with Claire with her first meal in over a day.  While it was not more than rice
with a spicy sauce, it did help quell her hunger pains.  They also had given her
some new clothing, an off white simple Thai dress.  It was not much, but it was
comfortable and it actually seemed to help with the heat.  Hopefully by this
evening she would be at the embassy and perhaps tomorrow or the next day on a
flight back to the United States. 

	Still Claire was utterly exhausted.  She really had not slept for two
days and the ride was so uncomfortable that she had little hope for dosing on
this trip.  The thought of a soft bed in an air conditioned home sounded so
wonderful to her.  Yet at the moment it still seemed like it was far away. 
Claire had no idea how long this trip would last or how long it would take to
contact the embassy.

	Dosing off and on, Claire awoke to discover that the truck had come to a
stop.  There was a slight commotion as a man said something in Thai to the
passengers directing them to get out.  Claire looked at the girl next to her and
asked, "What is he saying?  I do not understand Thai."

	In somewhat broken English the girl replied, "He is saying that we are
stopping here for a break and because the truck needs to be looked at.  He says
to go into the building and relax."

	Although Claire was very excited about getting to Bangkok, she welcomed
this break.  This would give her a chance to lie down and perhaps get a little
shut eye which she desperately needed.  Even though it was not dark outside the
air was still thick and the temperature very warm.  It almost felt like a warm,
moist blanket was enveloping her as she got out of the truck and walked towards
the building.  This looked like a regular pit stop for travelers as multiple
vehicles were parked here.

	The building inside was actually cool.  They appeared to have air
conditioning.  It was also quite nice.  There were tables and chairs set up and
a few people mingling about.  Claire and the other passengers were directed to a
room off to the side, which was spacious enough for everyone to lie down and
relax.  For the first time in several days, Claire felt comfortable.  Soon part
of this terrible ordeal would be over with and she would be with her family.

	Claire relaxed up against the wall and tried to clear her mind.  She
hoped and prayed that perhaps her family had survived and that she would be
united with them again in Bangkok.  At the very least, soon she would be back
with friends who could help her sort out the pieces of her broken life.  As
Claire tried to remain positive, she noticed a few people walking into the room. 
They seemed to be looking at her and the other refuges that were mostly lying up
against the wall.  Perhaps this was the Red Cross or some government
organization. 

	The people seemed to be talking to themselves and occasionally pointing
at one person or another.  The whole experience seemed a bit strange.  Then
suddenly Claire heard her name, "Claire is that you?"  Her eyes turned in the
direction of the words until they locked with Mei a girl from her school.

	"Mei... is that you?"

	"Claire what are you doing here?"  It was Mei.  Claire could not believe
her eyes.  For the first time in nearly 48 hours she recognized someone.  Things
were beginning to look up.  Although Mei was far from a close friend, actually
more of a rival, things were beginning to look up.	

	"Mei, my family, we were..." It was hard for Claire to manage the words. 
The grief and shock were still too real, "we were caught up in the tsunami.  I
am not sure what happened to them.  Everything, the beach, the hotel, the
people, they are all gone."  A tear began to roll down Claire's cheek once again
as she began to think about all the people including her family that were sucked
out to sea.

	Mei stood silent for a moment taking it all in.  Many people had been
affected by the disaster, but this was the first time that she knew someone who
had been lost.  "Claire, I am very sorry for your loss." Mei said sincerely,
"but what are you doing here?"

	"I was taking this truck to Bangkok.  I am going to the American embassy
so that I can contact my family.  Mei, everything is gone.  I lost everything
but the clothes on my back and they were ripped to shreds.  If the relief
organization had not given me something to wear, I would be sitting here in
rags."

	"Claire, I am sorry, but don't you know what this place is?"

	"No, I thought it was a rest stop."

	"Far from it Claire.  This is an auction house."

	"An auction house... what do you mean, why did they stop here?"

	"Because this is an auction house for people, and you are one of the
people up for auction."

	"What?  How can I be up for auction?  Is this some kind of joke?"

	"Listen Claire," Mei contemplated what to say, "This is a slave auction
and you are up for sale.  I do not know what truck you took or who told you
what, but in about ten minutes, you and all of the people with you are going to
be paraded out into that room and sold to the highest bidder."

	Claire seemed dumbstruck, "You must be kidding.  That sort of thing is
illegal.  You cannot actually go out and buy someone.  Stop joking with me Mei. 
I am already upset and not in the mood."

	"I am not joking Claire." As if almost to emphasize her point, a short
rather fat man picked up a girl who was sitting at the end of the row.  He began
pawing her, feeling her breasts, her ass, inspecting her like she was an animal. 
She whimpered a protest, but he yelled at her in Thai, something which Claire
did not understand, but it was enough to convince Claire that things were indeed
not as them seem. 

	"How... how could this happen?"  Claire managed to say.

	"My guess is that you were tricked into taking this truck, or the truck
driver tricked the aid station and pretended to be someone else.  Whatever
happened, you are here.  My guess is no one knows you are here, and it is very
likely that no one even knows you are alive, which makes you a prime candidate
for slavery.  No one will be looking for you.  They will just assume you died in
the tsunami."

	Claire thought about this for a moment.  She could not imagine that such
things still happened, but it made sense.  No one knew that she was here, and if
her parents had been killed in the accident, no one would even think to look for
her.  All her documentation had been lost in the disaster.  She truly was alone. 
The reality was beginning to sink in and as it did Claire began to feel an
overwhelming sense of desperation.  "Mei, you have to get me out of here. 
Please... you have to do something."

	Mei stood there silently for a moment.  Claire looked like a gazelle
fleeing for its life from a lion on the African savanna.  "Claire... I am not
sure I can help you.  These men are gangsters.  If I try to take you they are
likely to kill my father and me or make me a slave like yourself.  I mean if
they even think I will do anything, we are as good as dead."

	"Buy me then, buy me.  My family will repay you.  Please you have to buy
me.  I am begging you, don't leave me here."  Claire's expression had changed
from a look of terror to a look of desperation.

	"Claire... I'm not... I'm not sure we can afford you.  You are white and
young.  You are going to cost a lot of money.  There are people here from the
sex trade that will want to buy you."  Claire's jaw dropped as Mei spoke this
words.  This could not be happening.  This had to be a bad dream.  Mei felt pity
for her.  "Look Claire, I will see what I can do.

	As Mei walked out of the room, Claire contemplated her situation.  She
doubted that any of the other people who had made this trip with her, were aware
of the grim reality that awaited them.  In the back of her mind, Claire hoped
that this was still some sort of a cruel joke, but she doubted that Mei could do
such a thing.  While neither girl particularly cared for the other, this was not
a joking matter.  As that thought began to sink in, Claire began to look around
the room hoping to find some means of escape, but it quickly dawned on her that
this was not an option.  Mei was her only  help now...



Chapter 2 The Auction:
Claire followed the other people from the bus back into the main room of the
  building. She noticed that the chairs had been organized and arranged so that
  they all faced one side of the room. Most of the people were sitting down,
  although a few still remained standing in the back. The lighting was dark except
  for one end and it became clear that everyone's attention was focused on this
  area. This still seemed like just a bad dream. Certainly Mei had been exaggerating,
  but Claire's gut told her that Mei had indeed been truthful. 
A girl at the front of the line was led to the center of the lighted area.
  She was met by a rather short balding man who was speaking in Thai. As much
  as Claire tried to understand what was being said, she quickly realized that
  he was speaking to fast for her. The girl in contrast seemed to understand
  every word that was spoken and she backed away from the man with a sign of
  revulsion. She was, however, pushed back toward by two taller men from the
  shadows. 
The bald man pointed to the crowd, than back at the girl. There were occasional
  sounds from the crowd that Claire assumed were bids. It was difficult to hear
  or tell what was going on. The young girl stood stoically as the process continued.
  It appeared that in some way she had accepted her fate. Suddenly the man stopped
  talking and the girl was led away from him into the crowd. Claire was surprised
  to see that she was led to an Asian woman who looked to be perhaps 35. This
  shocked Claire. It was one thing for men to stoop to such levels, but how could
  a woman partake in something so horrific. Didn't these people have morals?
  This was shameful. 
The process continued on in pretty much the same fashion for over an hour
  as each person was brought up to the front and then eventually led away. Claire
  had some idea what was going on, but for the most part things continued without
  her paying much attention. She seemed to drift in an out of the reality of
  the current situation as exhaustion, fear and loneliness overtook her. 
Suddenly she was shocked back to reality as two men began pushing her up to
  the front of the room. She offered little resistance as she was frozen in fear.
  The lights were bright and warm as they shined on her. Claire found that they
  were bright enough that she could not see into the crowd. She found herself
  staring down at her feet in her simple white sneakers as the man next to her
  began to speak. 
The people sitting in the crowd were relatively quiet except for the rapid
  bidding. Claire sensed that there was some excitement around her. She could
  almost feel the excitement within the room. It was thick against the air and
  clung to her body like the sweat that dripped down the side of her face. The
  auctioneer seemed thrilled about the bidding. He was talking extremely fast
  and continually pointing to different people within the room. It appeared as
  though he was making the best sale of his life and each new bid seemed to give
  him even more energy. 
Things were moving in a frenzy now. Claire could only hope that Mei's father
  was in on the bids. She had no idea what was going to happen to her if they
  did not succeed. Although her family had been in Thailand for a few years,
  she suddenly realized just how strange and alien this world truly was. She
  did not know these people or understand their customs and culture. Her time
  here had been spent sheltered from this existence and now she was getting a
  crash course. 
Suddenly the bidding stopped. There was silence in the room for a second and
  then the sound of clapping. It seemed like the entire process had been very
  exciting to the audience. Perhaps Claire was the first white woman that they
  had ever seen sold. Whatever the case, things seemed to freeze for a brief
  instant before Claire found herself getting pushed back into the crowd to her
  new owner� 
Claire's eyes began to adjust to the darkness as she moved through the room.
  Her focus returned and in an instant she found herself looking into the face
  of Mei who was smiling. Mei spoke to her, �Claire we did it. My father was
  able to get you. I was really surprised. You went for much less than I expected
  and were still within out budget. Maybe people were scared to bid because you
  are white.� 
For the first time since she had been in this building, Claire felt an overwhelming
  sense of relief. �Thank you Mei. Thank you�� She could barely contain herself
  as a tear rolled down her cheek. The nightmare was over. She followed Mei and
  her father out to a car where a driver was waiting. They hopped in and drove
  off down the road.
An hour or so later the car pulled up to a large house that was situated in
  the country. Claire seemed puzzled by this as she had assumed they were going
  back to Bangkok. She looked a Mei and said, �Where are we? I thought we were
  heading to the city.� 
�Claire it is late. My family owns a farm and we will stay here for a few
  days.� Claire was puzzled by this but did not want to upset Mei. After all
  she felt like she owed her life. They got out of the car and Claire followed
  Mei into the house. Mei looked over at Claire as they walked, �Claire please
  remove your shoes.� Without hesitation, Claire removed her sneakers and followed
  Mei in. The tile was cold against her bare feet and sent a shiver up her spine.
  The two girls walked through the house back into a small room that was about
  8 ft by 6 ft. 
The rooms only furniture was a bed that sat in the corner with a small table
  next to it. The floor had black tile and it was cold to the touch. There was
  a small closet on one end of the room and on the opposite wall a small square
  window. �Jeez Mei, I thought your family was rich. No offense but this room
  is kind of crappy.� 
�Claire it's the maid's room.� 
Claire laughed a bit. �A hah hah, funny Mei. So your family buys me at the
  market today to work as a maid and now you have me sleeping in the maid's quarters.
  That is a great joke.� 
�It is not a joke Claire, this is where you are staying.� Mei looked seriously
  at Claire. �I am sorry it is not up to your expectations but this is where
  you will be staying. You are the maid.� 
�Okay Mei you have had your fun,� Claire looked annoyed. �I am the maid. Get
  over your power trip and come back to reality Mei.� 
�I am talking about reality Claire. You were purchased by my father to work
  as a housemaid, and you will work as a housemaid. Legally you are the property
  of my family.� 
�Mei this is not funny. You can't keep me here against my will. There is no
  way in this world that I am going to work for you as a housemaid. I would never
  live it down with our friends.� 
�Claire I know you think this is a game, but it is not. You are not going
  back to your former life. You are staying here and working as a housemaid.
  You can either accept that fact or be beaten with a cane by my father's manservant,
  and I assure you that you will not like that one bit. You are, however, right
  about keeping you here. You are free to go, but I assure you that you will
  not reach Bangkok on foot and the odds are you will end up working in some
  dingy brothel� 
Claire was thoroughly irritated, but did not know what to say. Could this
  actually be happening? She looked down at her feet unable to look Mei in the
  eyes. Mei, on the other hand, was smiling triumphantly. Claire always was a
  bit of a pushover. This had been too easy. Finally, Claire spoke, �What do
  you want from me Mei?� Her voice was a bit shaky as she fought back the tears. 
�I want you to start acting like a proper maid. Stop calling me Mei. You should
  be calling me Miss. We are not equals, in fact we are far from equals. You
  are a slave. My father is not paying you, you work because you are property
  and nothing else. Is that clear?� 
�Yes Miss, it is clear.� 
�Good, I am glad you learn quickly. Now I want you to go to bed. At sunrise
  you will go to the closet and put on one of the uniforms. I hope you can figure
  it out. It is a skirt called a pha sin and a simple blouse. This is what we
  wear in Thailand. Yours I am afraid are not made of silk, but the cloth is
  more durable and will serve you well. Now thank me for giving you the rest
  of the evening off.� 
�Thank you Miss,� Claire said sarcastically. 
�Not like that,� Mei seemed annoyed as she grabbed Claire and pushed her down
  on the floor. �Kiss my feet, maid,� she spat out the words as Claire struggled
  up to her knees. Claire hesitated, but Mei pushed her head down. Claire was
  disgusted but her lips kissed each of Mei's small tan feet. They smelled a
  little, but Claire lingered by them as she was nervous that Mei may physically
  hurt her. 
With that, Mei pushed her away and walked out of the room leaving Claire on
  the floor a few tears in her eyes. The taste and smell of Mei's feet was fresh
  in her memory as she got up and laid down on the cheap mattress that was to
  be her bed. 
Chapter 3 � Claire learns a tough lesson. 
Claire slept fitfully throughout the night. Her room was hot and sticky and
  her mind was racing a mile a minute. The thick air from outside barely moved
  inside her tiny room, which was not much larger than her parents' walk in closet.
  However, even if conditions were ideal, Claire would not have slept. Her thoughts
  dwelled on her family and the last 48 hours. So much had changed in such a
  short period of time, that Claire hoped it was just a bad dream. She could
  still see the faces of her family. The vacation had been a surprise from her
  father who had been working long hours and wanted to spend some extra time
with the family. Now they were gone and Claire was stuck in this strange place. 
Dawn came quickly and Claire realized that she had hardly slept at all. She
  was exhausted, but she still managed to get up and put on the skirt and blouse
  that Mei had shown her. Both were made out of cotton and were extremely plain,
  light blue in color. The skirt went down to her ankles while the blouse had
  short sleeves and rough edges. The material was light and not uncomfortable.
  It was suitable for the hot Thai climate and would provide a moderate amount
  of comfort during the heat of the day. 
As Claire finished dressing she noticed that a note had been attached to her
  door. It read simply, �Come upstairs to my room and I will provide you a list
  of chores for the day. My room is on the right. Do not keep me waiting� 
Claire was annoyed. How could Mei be doing this? Certainly this was all a
  dreadful joke, but why had Mei taken it so far. Claire was humiliated and would
  never be able to look Mei in the eyes again. She had won. Their rivalry was
  over. Wasn't that enough for Mei? 
Claire trudged upstairs. They were cold against her feet despite the hot humid
  air that seemed to fill the house. Perhaps Mei would be laughing and smiling
  when she got upstairs and tell Claire that she had only been joking last night.
  Hope seemed to return to her as she made it to the top and walked toward Mei's
  room. The door was closed. Claire was not sure what to do. Should she walk
  in? Should she knock? Should she wait until Mei opened the door? She was frozen
  as the minutes passed by. Finally she made a decision and opened the door. 
Mei's room was large, at least 4 or 5 times the size of Claire's room and
  filled with furniture. The walls were decorated with Thai and western artwork
  and also a few posters of modern pop stars. The bed sat in the middle. It was
  gorgeous. The sheets looked like they were made from the finest linen and the
  wood looked like it had been hand carved. Mei was still in it as Claire walked
  in. She turned and looked at Claire somewhat startled, �Maid, how dare you
  come in my room without knocking.� 
Claire was taken aback. She felt horrible for not knocking. �Uhmmm� I am sorry
  Ma'am. I did not mean to disturb you.� Claire was disgusted by the sound of
  her voice as she said these words. Who was Mei to talk to her like that? 
�Jeez�� Mei said annoyingly, �I would have thought that a westerner would
  know basic manners. I guess all maids are naturally stupid.� The words bit
  into Claire and she visibly flinched. �Well I guess I will have to train you
  like the other maids who have worked in this home. Being a slave owner is no
  easy task.� 
It was impossible to control her anger as Claire said, �Mei, this is really
  not funny anymore. Enough with this game already.� 
�How dare you call me by my first name maid.� She yelled, �Erawen!!!� In an
  instant the door opened and a rather tall plainly dressed Thai man walked in.
  Mei spoke to him in Thai so that Claire could not tell what was going on. She
  struggled to pick up the words, but was unable to interpret them. The man suddenly
  grabbed Claire and pushed her up against the bed. In an instant he produced
  a thick rattan cane, which he raised and swung against Claire's ass. Before
  Claire could even comprehend what was happening, her body was filled with burning
  pain. The shock drove her into the bed as another blow rained down on her.
  Claire's eyes were watering as she screamed in agony. 
Mei raised her hand and the man stopped after just two blows. Her face was
  beaming as she realized that she truly had complete control. It would not take
  long to break Claire. �You must understand maid that there are rules in this
  house. You cannot speak so freely with a superior. I am above you. You are
  a meager servant and must think about my happiness in life. That is your duty.
  If you do it well, you will be rewarded, but it you upset me�� With that Mei
  motioned to the man who brought another blow down on Claire. 
Claire's body convulsed against the bed as she desperately tried to avoid
  the blows. �Please Ma'am,� she cried, �Please have mercy on me.� Another blow
  landed below her ass along her thighs causing her to jerk back from the bed.
  The pain was so intense that Claire could barely see. Her eyes were blurred
  by her own tears and the terrible searing agony that emanated from each blow.
  Finally after the fifth blow, the beating ceased. Claire wept openly. Never
  in her life has she experienced anything like this before. No one had ever
  laid a hand on her. Now it felt like her body was on fire. That her very flesh
  was on fire. 
Mei looked on triumphantly. �I am sorry maid, but it is important to establish
  discipline early on in your training. I assure you that this beating will help
  prevent future poor behavior. Next time you misbehave, Erawen will give you
  ten lashings from his cane. I hope that you have learned your lesson.� 
�Yes�� Claire wept, tears streaming down her face. 
�Yes� what?� Mei asked. 
�Yes, Ma'am.� Claire said as Mei smiled enjoying her twisted form of pleasure.
  Breaking Claire was proving to be more fun than she could have ever imagined. 
�Good. Now I have a busy day planned for you. There is much to do in this
  house and I will not tolerate a slow learner. I have arranged for you to learn
  from another one of the family maids. She will teach you everything that you
  need to know around the kitchen. When she is done with you, I expect you to
  report back to me, as I will have other chores for you to do. Do you understand,
  maid?� 
�Yes Ma'am. I understand.� 
�Good, now thank me for taking time out of my busy life to spend time training
  you.� Claire knew what to do and while a small part of her mind tried to resist,
  she did not hesitate as she kissed each of Mei's tan bare feet. �Good now get
  down to the kitchen. You have already wasted too much time today.� 
Claire stood up and tried to walk out of the room. The pain from her recent
  caning was still fresh within her mind and her body. She hobbled out of the
  room, all too happy to be away from the vindictive Mei.

Part 4 Claire
Learns How to Clean a Kitchen���������� Claire
hobbled down the stairs into the main part of the house looking for the
kitchen.� She could hear some noise
coming off to her left and walked toward the sound.� Thankfully, it appeared that she had found the
right place.� A middle-aged woman,
dressed in a similar manner to Claire was busy scrubbing the floor.� As Claire walked in the woman looked up and
smiled softly.� Perhaps things were
beginning to look up.�� The woman said
something to Claire in Thai, which she did not understand.� Claire replied, &quot;I am sorry but I do not
understand.&quot;� The older maid
repeated herself again, but Claire could do nothing but stare at her.� Finally, angry at the lack of response from
Claire, the maid stood up and pushed Claire to the ground.� She pointed at the rag and shouted at Claire.��� It became very obvious that Claire was being
instructed to scrub the floor.� While
this was not an ideal situation, it could be worse.� Obediently she grabbed the rag and dipped it
into the water before using it to wash the floor.� The water felt warm, but was really only air
temperature.� Hot water was a luxury in
the country even for a family as wealthy as Mei's.� It would certainly not be wasted on something
as simple as scrubbing the kitchen floor.� The
older maid watched her as she worked diligently on the floor.� Her look went from a soft smile to a frown as
she mopped the floor.� Claire did not see
this change as her focus remained on the hard floor.� Suddenly, out of nowhere, the woman began
shouting at her.� It was impossible to
understand what she was saying as Claire knew very little Thai.� The maid seemed to get more and more angry.� Finally with little warning she backhanded
Claire across the face.��� The blow sent
Claire tumbling to the ground.� She could
taste the warm salty hint of blood in her mouth as she realized that the maid's
blow had cut her lip.� Not sure what to
do, she went back to scrubbing the floor, working faster than before.� This seemed to placate the woman and she moved
away from Claire.����� Claire was working
feverishly on the floor.� It was still
only morning, but the temperature in the kitchen felt like it was almost 90
degrees.� She was hot, thirsty and
exhausted, yet at the same time, she was terrified to stop.� Her formidable taskmaster was not that far
away washing pots and pans.� The work was
grueling.� The floor was hard stone,
which caused her knees to ache after only a few minutes.� Surely this was just a test.� No one in this day would scrub a floor by
hand when mops were so easy to come by.��� Eventually
the pain became more of a blur as Claire's mind tried to zone out what was
happening.� She became lost in her work
and her mind cleared as she focused on the floor.� About an hour later, she realized that she
had finished the job.� For the first time
since the ordeal began, she got the courage to look up at the other maid in the
room.� The woman was smiling and seemed
genuinely pleased.� Apparently, Claire
was a fast learner.� She was relieved by
the smile and breathed a long sign of relief.� The
relief did not last long as the older maid motioned for Claire to
approach.� Claire quickly realized how
much pain her body was in as she tried to rise.�
Her knees nearly buckled beneath her as she stumbled forward.� The other woman was waiting with a rag for
her as she approached.� There were still
dozens of pots and pans left to be cleaned.�
Without a word, Claire took the rag and began scrubbing the pots and
pans.� The older maid looked on for a few
minutes, seemed satisfied and then walked out of the room.����� For the first time since the early
morning, Claire was alone.� Although she
was exhausted and out of breath, she managed to think back on the last few
days.� So much had changed.� In just two days she was expected back at school,
but that seemed less and less likely as she worked on the dingy pans.� The soap was abrasive against her skin.� She felt like she was rubbing her own skin
off as she carefully washed each pan.� A
tear rolled down her cheek.� How long was
this nightmare going to last...













As Claire worked on the pots and pan her mind drifted back to the last couple of days. 
Everything seemed to be a dream. Never in her wildest dreams could she imagine the 
events which had unfolded before her, yet here she was scrubbing dirty pots and pans by 
hand. The work was grueling and the heat in the kitchen was steadily increasing as the sun 
continued to rise in the morning sky. 

Claire was so focused on her work that she did not notice that someone else had entered 
the kitchen. It was Mei's father. He walked right up behind Claire and grabbed her around 
the waist. The startled girl dropped her pan and let out a sharp cry. Without hesitation, 
Mei's father hushed her. 

Terrified and not sure what was happening, Claire stood silently as Mei's father groped 
her body. Slowly he worked his hands underneath her skirt and lifted it up. Claire did not 
like where this was going and began to squirm. Angered by her actions, Mei's father shook 
her hard and yelled at her in Thai. The words had no meaning to her, but Claire knew not 
to struggle with him. 

Mei's father pushed Claire up against the counter top and bent her over it. Claire was 
terrified and afraid to move. Suddenly she felt something up against her even though both 
of the man's hands were groping her breasts. With a fast movement she felt a sharp pain 
as Mei's father thrust into her virgin womb. The pain was terrible and Claire cried out again, 
"Please Sir, you are hurting me. Please stop." She tried again to wiggle away but the two 
of them were joined together. 

Although Mei's father did not have a large cock, less than six inches, it felt huge inside 
the inexperienced Claire. His thrusting increase as he held her there against the counter. 
Each thrust resulted in a responsive grunt from the inexperienced Claire. The only noise in 
the kitchen was the sound of his heavy breathing and her continuous grunts, "ughhh! 
ughhh! ughhh!" 

After a couple of minutes the pain began to subside. Claire's own body began to betray 
itself as her natural lubrication began to ease the man's passage into her. She felt 
completely filled as his cock went in and out. There was no tenderness in his approach. He 
was simply using her to get off. Mei's father did not care whether Claire was enjoying her 
fucking or not, he simply was using her body as a means to relieve himself. Claire's natural 
responses were, however, turning him on. Upon entry he knew she was a virgin and that 
made his cock throb all the more. Never in his life had he had the opportunity to fuck a 
white virgin. Claire was truly worth every penny that he had paid for her at auction. 

Claire was in shock. She knew that she was being raped but her body was paralyzed to 
fight back. This could not be happening to her. Cleaning up a few pots and pans was one 
thing but being used like this, it was horrible. She began to come back to her senses just 
as Mei's father tensed up. In an instant she heard him groan loudly, "Argghhhhhh!!!" and 
then Claire felt a warm sensation deep inside her womb. Mei's father was done in an 
instant and pulled out of her. He walked away without saying another word, leaving Claire 
bent over the counter. 

Trying to compose herself, Claire pulled down her skirt and stood there for a moment. 
She could feel a combination of her blood and Mei's father's cum running down the inside of 
her leg. Not sure what to do, she went back to scrubbing the pots and pans. Although she 
felt used, the last thing she wanted to do was incur the wrath of the older maid who had 
trained her to clean in the kitchen. Tears rolled down her cheeks and cum down her legs as 
she got back to work. This, however, would have gone unnoticed by anyone entering the 
room since all they would see was the backside of a Thai maid doing her duty.
