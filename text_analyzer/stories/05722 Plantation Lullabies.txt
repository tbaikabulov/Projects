Plantation Lullabies

&nbsp;

What would make a person spend $20,000 on a week-long
session with a pro-domme?� Believe it or
not, Mistress Emmanuelle, the Black Dominatrix who arrogantly charged the
exorbitant fee, was booked solid for eight months in advance with
her popularity growing by word of mouth alone.�
Charles Trenton was intrigued by the concept when he read about her on
his favorite BDSM message board.� The
thread was started by someone who claimed to have been a client of this
outrageously strict Ebony Domme whose activities were being touted as nothing
less than illegal at best and deranged psychosis in the very worst-case
scenario.� There was a bit of controversy
over the thread because someone claiming to be the head of a bank wrote the
original post but it was written in disjointed and barely literate phonetics,
raising all sorts of issues over the authenticity of the so-called �facts�
presented.� Adding insult to injury, the
original poster seemed to have posted the same message on several message boards
and never stuck around long enough to reply or defend his claims.� 

&nbsp;

Curious, Charles Googled the name �Mistress Emmanuelle� to
see if he could find out some more information.�
With over 500 results, he had his work cut out for him.� He eliminated all the results that were for
the Russian Domme by the same name and he was down to a little more than 100
links to check out.� More than half of
them were reposts of the same cryptic message he had already read and the
majority of the others seemed to go to random white women claiming to be
Dommes.� Deciding to narrow down his
search by using a few keywords from the original message, he hit pay dirt.� One click and he was on www.trueslaveexperience.com.� 

&nbsp;

It was a simple website, a single webpage really,
outlining Mistress Emmanuelle�s philosophy.�
It explained how, in so many instances, white subs claim they want to be
enslaved to a Black woman, to be punished for their whiteness without
comprehending how disrespectful and ignorant they are of what actual slaves had
to endure.� She claimed to have a
100-acre plantation that replicated the true slave experience and which had
NOTHING to do with sexual subservience or fulfilling some sassy negro/mammy
fantasy. She boldly proclaimed, �I make rich white men feel real pain and
agony.� I decide if and when they eat,
sleep, drink, piss, and shit.� I
administer punishment randomly, indiscriminately, and I do so with extreme
sadistic pleasure.� If you come to my
domain, I will break your spirit and crush it under my stiletto like a
worthless bug.� I beat and torture the
arrogance out of my clients until they can no longer face their pale, pathetic
reflections in the mirror.�

&nbsp;

Assured that he wasn�t like the men being described on the
webpage, Charles read every word over and over, knowing full well that he had
no intention of forking over that sort of money.� There was a number at the bottom of the page,
however, that said that serious inquiries should call for further information.� It was too tempting.� Always protective of his identity and overly
cautious, he got a disposable cell phone that couldn�t be traced and called the
10 digits.� Anticipating some sort of
voice mail, he was shocked when a woman answered, identifying herself as
Mistress Emmanuelle.� 

&nbsp;

She was polite and articulate and she explained how she
had inherited a rather large plantation off the coast of South Carolina
originally owned by her paternal great, great, great grandfather who was a
slave owner.� Unaware that his favorite
concubine was skilled in voodoo and black magic, he got a terrible fever and
passed away in a fitful, painful episode, but not before changing his will to
reflect that he was freeing all his slaves and leaving his land and money to
the slave gal who bore his children.�
Charles listened intently as she said, �I�ll inflict pain so
excruciating, so piercing that you�ll pray for the sweet release of
death.�� 

&nbsp;

The silence on the telephone line was drowned out by the
pounding of the blood that rang in his ears.�
Snapped out of his stupor, he heard the words, �. . . all I�ll need is
your social security number and 50% deposit and I can give you a date for your
session.�

&nbsp;

He hung up the phone without saying a word.� His identity, his privacy, was all that he
held sacred.� There was no way in hell he
was going to give a stranger $20,000 AND the key to his security.� Charles had an unnatural paranoia that he was
going to be found out, that there were somehow mechanisms in place from on high
that would bring the world to a crashing halt if anyone �regular� were to find
out about his perversions.� It was
nothing more than inflated, white male ego.�
In as much as he wanted to deny his similarity to privileged, racist,
submissives, at his core he was exactly the same.� He wrote the whole thing off and decided
never to think of it again.� His
resolution didn�t last a half hour.� He
kept hearing her words over and over again.�
�I�ll inflict pain so excruciating, so piercing that you�ll pray for the
sweet release of death.�� His mind reeled
at what sort of punishment could be that extreme.� He called her back and asked more
questions.� 

&nbsp;

She explained, �I�ll replicate the slave experience in
exacting detail.� I�ll tear you down only
to recreate you as I wish.� On day six,
I�ll let you experience release and on day seven, if you choose to leave you
are free to do so.�� 

&nbsp;

What the hell did she mean, �If you choose to leave?�� What kind of ridiculous thing was that to
say?� Surely she understood that he had a
job, responsibilities, that he had a life in which he was very
needed.� Charles was amazed at how
courteous and professional she was for someone who had just told him she was
going to charge him an obscene amount of money to beat him to within inches of
his life.� He hung up and acknowledged to
himself that he was going to have to weigh the pros and cons very
seriously.� She certainly presented a
compelling opportunity and one that had his curiosity piqued.� 

&nbsp;

It wasn�t until his plane landed in South Carolina that he
realized the magnitude of what he�d done.�
The hardest part of the entire process was the wait.� Six months of mental anguish plagued him and
he contemplated if he must have had some sort of lapse in judgment to make him
go through with something so outrageous.�
There was something deep inside him, some perverse desire that resided
in his DNA that compelled him to seek pain, punishment, to suffer at the hands
of a Black Domme.� As he stepped off the
plane and into the sweltering heat and humidity of Charleston, sweat poured off
his body but not from the climate.� 

&nbsp;

A young woman stood with his name on a sign stood waiting
by a limo.� She was a Black woman dressed
in a man�s chauffer suit who looked stoic but beautiful.� Taking a deep breath, he said, �I�m uhmmm . .
. I think you are here to pick me up.���
Are you with . . . ?�� 

&nbsp;

She opened the door and ushered him inside before he could
finish.� The windows were tinted and the
divider was up so he couldn�t see a thing.�
They drove for about a half hour when they stopped and she lowered the
partition and said, �Stay!�� When she
opened her door the strong smell of the ocean was evident.� Through the front windshield he could tell
they were at a marina.� The driver spoke
to another woman, less stoic but equally as beautiful, onboard a mid-sized
cabin cruiser.� They laughed and chatted
casually while he fidgeted in the car.� 

&nbsp;

The driver opened the door and he understood he was to get
out.� He boarded the boat and extended
his hand to the captain of the boat nervously, trying to gauge what his
appropriate response was supposed to be. �I�ll take your cell phone, your
wallet, watch, and your keys, along with any other items that might be
personal.�� Charles looked around like he
was being punked but he went along with it in the spirit of cooperation.� The captain opened a door of sorts in the
floor and he again understood that he was to climb down the ladder.� Just as he made his descent, he felt
something crack down on his skull and he crashed to the floor in excruciating
pain.� The door slammed shut and he was
lying on a wooden floor covered in a thick slime with a stench that made him
want to vomit.� There were no lights, he
could barely see five inches in front of his face and the heat was unbearable
in the small quarters, as he could feel the purr of the engine running nearby
combined with the stifling temperatures.�


&nbsp;

Immediately, he was filled with rage.� This wasn�t what he signed up for.� He yelled, �Let me out of here,� but the
engine roared and he could tell there were heading out to sea beyond where
people could hear his pleas.� He drifted
in and out of consciousness as the pain in his head throbbed.� 

&nbsp;

Waves lapped at the boat as he regained full consciousness
and they were anchored somewhere.� He
wasn�t sure how long he�d been in that hole but he was hungry and needed to use
the bathroom.� He hollered up through the
floor.� �I know what you�re doing.� This is supposed to be like a slave
ship.� You can�t keep me here against my
will.� This is kidnapping.� Let me out.�
I�ll sue your ass.�� Yelling took
entirely too much energy from him and the smell caused him to wretch as he felt
himself dry heaving in nausea.� He felt
his head and he could feel a lump and dried blood.� He couldn�t tell if it was night or day or
how far they had traveled.� 

&nbsp;

His ignorance of what Africans endured during the
Trans-Atlantic slave trade could fill volumes.��
His plight was minimal compared to those who survived the Long March
only to be piled on top of each other, shackled in the hulls of ships for
months, unable to move, kidnapped and stolen from their homes and families
involuntarily.� Charles was there of his
own volition.� It was his choice, his
vacation.� Being inflicted with pain was
his sick and perverted preference and he was paying the price, sorely.

&nbsp;

He was in that hole so long, he was beginning to think
that they were going to just leave him there to die and throw him overboard,
food for sharks.� The door opened and the
light from the sun temporarily blinded him.�
He steadied himself and climbed on deck.�
He collapsed and tried to fill his lungs with the fresh sea air.� A bucket of water was thrown on him and he
could smell bleach and maybe some sort of insecticide or maybe a disinfected in
it.� He�d soiled himself at some point
and his skin was started to sting and burn from lying in his own waste for so
long.� �Where are we?� Where�s Mistress Emmanuelle?�� 

&nbsp;

�Dewees.�

&nbsp;

�What?� What the
hell is that?� Bitch, tell me where I am!
Take me back to the airport right away.��
His normally subservient demeanor in the presence of Black women was
thrown overboard as he demanded answers and demanded them immediately.� 

&nbsp;

The captain seemed unfazed by his little tirade and
instructed him to take off his dirty clothes and put on what amounted to little
more than a rough burlap sack sort of covering and nothing else.� She placed a ball gag in his mouth and leg
irons on him.� The steel cut into his
flesh but he was unable to complain because he couldn�t speak.� Once on land, he was tethered to a golf cart
in which yet another lovely Black woman was responsible for his transport.� �Keep up,� was all she said.� 

&nbsp;

The island where they landed was like an oasis in the
desert.� The land was lush and the beach
was pristine.� There were no gas-powered
vehicles and a huge hotel flanked the shores.�
It was the Island of Dewees and it was part of the Gullah Sea Islands
that existed mostly in a time warp of traditional African culture and antebellum
aesthetics.� It was like something out of
a Margaret Mitchell novel.� The Black
population of the island spoke fluent Gullah, a Creole language Charles had
never even heard of before.� They passed
by the Black residents who waved at the driver and greeted her like she was a
beloved neighbor, ignoring the half naked white man who scrambled behind
secured with a rope.� The white people
they passed turned their heads in disgust and turned up their noses at Charles
as if they knew what fate lay before him but they were accessories to his
predicament with their disdain.� He
struggled to keep from being dragged like James Byrd knowing there would be no
TV cameras there to report him being lynched to death.� His shoes were left somewhere on the boat so
he was forced to run bare-footed on the rough terrain.� The majority of the journey was on a paved
road but the heat from the asphalt made it unbearable.� 

&nbsp;

They pulled onto a dirt road lined with trees that looked
hundreds of years old.� He could see a
big house in the distance and his body ached with exhaustion and relief that
his uncomfortable ordeal was over.� He
was literally dying of thirst and his body was dehydrated.� Little did he know that the worst was ahead
of him.� He was
starving and felt as if he would pass out.�
He passed fields with workers, white men attired in the same sack
clothing, who didn�t even look up, they appeared to be drones or robots,
lifeless almost, working . . . like slaves.�


&nbsp;

He was led inside and into the parlor where Mistress
Emmanuelle stood to greet him.� �Chuck,
what a pleasure to meet you, do come in.�� She extended her hand pulled out a
chair.� Charles stood, staring her
down.� 

&nbsp;

To say that Emmanuelle was breathtaking was an
understatement.� She was one of the most
gorgeous women he had ever seen in his life.�
Her severe black suit hugged her curves. She sat behind an enormous,
antique oak desk with all the modern technological advances that money could
buy and pulled out a file.� She quoted
every asset he had, the names and addresses of the Board of Directors from his
job, and produced a copy of his credit report and slid it towards him.� His gaze was fixed and intense and he didn�t
make a move.� He wanted to end this game
and go home.� The money he lost would be
an expensive lesson learned but he wanted to call it all off.� Never again, he swore to himself, would he
let his delusions of submission rule his actions.� Never again.

&nbsp;

�You�ll excuse me won�t you, Chuck?�� She leaned into the intercom and said, �Send
in Chambers.�� The expansive French doors
opened and a white man entered, avoiding looking at Charles.� He assumed a prone position on the floor and
Mistress Emmanuelle stepped out from behind the desk.� Lifting her skirt and turning her back to
Charles, she obscenely squatted over the man�s face and lowered her bare pussy
to his mouth.� Charles stared at her full
backside, unable to take his eyes from the scene before him as he watched the
Black woman unleash a torrent of piss in the man�s mouth.� The man swallowed, trying to drink as much of
her hot urine as he could.� When she
finished pissing, she turned to face Charles and maintaining the most intense
eye contact, she again lowered herself until she was sitting directly on the
man�s face.� He lapped at the droplets of
piss that lingered on her sumptuous cunt lips and drove his tongue deep inside
her.� Grabbing a fistful of hair,
Emmanuelle held his head between her thighs like a vice, essentially fucking
herself on his mouth.� She put her
asshole directly over his nose and mouth and slowly began to grind her butt
ever so detectably.� Charles swallowed
hard as he could see a crimson color start to cover the sub�s body, evidence
that he was indeed being suffocated.� His
body was beginning to thrash around on the floor but he held steadfast in his
coveted position as cushion for the lovely brown bottom that was riding his
face.� 

&nbsp;

Charles was frozen to that spot.� He wanted to look away but Mistress
Emmanuelle held him riveted to the floor with just her eyes.� She showed the telltale signs of a Mona
Lisa-like smile but her control was evident.�
When she closed her eyes, she started breathing heavier, bouncing up and
down more aggressively.� She was going to
cum and cum hard.� Charles would have
loved nothing more than to grab his cock and stroke it but he knew, without
being told, that he wasn�t allowed.�
Still disoriented, his brain was misfiring.� His tongue was sticking out, as if he was
licking the sweet folds of her wet pussy and tongue fucking her dark, musky
asshole.� Emmanuelle was moaning,
groaning, chanting over and over, �Oh yeah, eat my Black pussy, lick my ass you
piece of shit white boy.� Show our guest
here exactly how much I own you, how I own your soul.� You�ll do anything I say, no matter how
degrading, how perverse, in front of anyone I tell you with no shame because
you belong to me and I control your every desire.� 

&nbsp;

The man acting as her human toilet seat moaned his
affirmation in between the full, round asscheeks of his Mistress as she grabbed
a riding crop from the edge of the desk and delivered the swiftest, most
extreme blow possible to the worthless sissy�s nuts.� His screams were muffled by the fact that
Mistress Emmanuelle seemed to be flooding his mouth with her flowing pussy
cream.� 

&nbsp;

She stood, lowered her skirt and stood up as Chambers knelt
to lick the hardwood floor of any drops of piss that he�d missed.� Emmanuelle lifted the hem on the man�s shirt
and exposed his naked ass and whacked his balls with the riding crop again.� She twisted them cruelly in her hands for
good measure and the sub licked and moaned that much harder.� With a simple wave of her hand, she dismissed
him and he was gone without a word.� She
moved gracefully to sit behind the desk and addressed Charles like nothing had
happened.� 

&nbsp;

�Okay, Chuck, now where were we?� Oh, yes, of course.� I have some consent forms here for you to
sign that release my employees and I from any legal liability in the event that
you have second thoughts or regrets.� If
they would actually hold up in a court of law is really very doubtful but I
like to have them on hand just in case.�
I�ve yet to have anyone contest their treatment but just to be on the
safe side . . . If you sign them, you are saying that you are aware that you
are going to be subjected to torture and punishment for your pleasure and that
we have the right to mark, alter, and essentially punish you in any way and
every way we see fit and that you�ve freely consented by paying for our
services.� We will do everything that
white slave owners did to slaves but you�ll be paying for it.� Got it?��


&nbsp;

Charles thought he was going to faint.� He was light-headed from hunger and
exhaustion but his cock was rock hard from the little spectacle that had just
transpired in front of him.� Again, his
perverse desires betrayed his resolve; his declaration that he was never again
going to let his libido dictate his actions was nothing more than dust in the
wind in that moment.� �Never don�t last
always,� like ole� folks used to say.� He
was still wearing the ball gag so all he could do was nod his consent.� The ink was barely dry on the forms before he
was whisked off to a barn-like building where he was to be �seasoned.�

&nbsp;

Seasoning was the process that slaves endured in which
they were broken in spirit in order to become good slaves.� They were inflicted with extreme
psychological and physical torture in order to ensure that they wouldn�t try to
run or rebel.� A group of women dressed
in tight fitting riding pants that hugged their every curve and crisp white
cotton shirts with single-tail whips attached to their dark leather belts
surrounded him.� Their knee-high, black
riding boots caressed their strong calves and shined so highly that the sun
cast a glare off them.� They all spoke in
Gullah and Charles felt disoriented by the strange language. �They put thick wrist cuffs on his arms and
secured him to a hook in the ceiling.� He
could feel the heat from a fire behind him and he saw them walking towards it
with a branding iron.� The ball gag
muffled his screams and one of the women whispered something in his ear as he
felt his flesh being seared with the hot metal.�
The pain was more intense than anything he�d ever felt and his body
contorted and twisted in a natural reflex to escape the scorching hot metal.� Tears would have flowed but he was too dehydrated
to cry.� He felt like an idiot; he had
had the opportunity to leave and here he was, being marked like a piece of beef
of his own volition.� 

&nbsp;

He awoke, on the floor, and he could barely move his
limbs.� His ass had been permanently
marked and he was sure it was something that indicated that he was the property
of the Domina Emmanuelle.�� One of the
women towered over him and kicked him in the side.� He thought for a minute she was just abusing
him but he soon realized that he was being directed to move.� He crawled on his hands and knees to the
corner of the room where there were two metal bowls on the floor like dog
dishes.� The food was covered with flies
and the water was brown.� He lapped at
the water like a dog, dismissing the thoughts of what sort of bacteria and
germs flourished in it.� The food was
rancid and greasy and he could only stomach a few mouthfuls before he started
to vomit again.� 

&nbsp;

There were three women in total and while he was still
bringing up what little food he had been able to stomach, he felt a leash being
applied to his throat and being pulled across the room.� There was a pot of water being heated on the
fire and full enema equipment prepared.�
Charles looked around and pleaded with his eyes.� Boiling water would kill him, burn his
intestines.� Tears stained his cheeks but
his body was too weak to fight.� Someone
removed his ball gag but he didn�t have the strength to fight, he simply
prepared himself for the pain that was to come.�


&nbsp;

The water was actually heated to 112 degrees, not hot
enough to kill him but more than hot enough to inflict excruciating
torture.� Fingers probed his asshole
without the benefit of lube and he felt the thick end of a medical speculum
being inserted.� They spread the
apparatus so they could insert the nozzle deeply into his colon.� He braced himself in defiance, determined not
to show signs of weakness but the second the clamp was released and the
scalding water flowed into his bowels, he screamed out like a wounded
animal.� Slapping his face, the women
revived him just as he was to be administered a second enema of ice cold
water.� The second enema was more painful
than the first and he soon lost consciousness again.� 

&nbsp;

Restraints were placed on his ankles, wrists, and balls so
that if he moved his arms or tried to run it would cause his testicles to be
pulled painfully from his body.� The
women picked him up and placed him in a box smaller than a coffin and shut the
lid, leaving him to expel the rest of the contents of his bowel in the tiny prison.� He smelled his burnt flesh over the putrid
filth that leaked from his anus.� He
closed his eyes and tried to leave his body, to go someplace where he was
normal, where pain didn�t motivate his perverse fantasies.� 

&nbsp;

Someone opened the lid to the box.� He braced himself for more torture but he
felt the soothing touch of a hand helping him sit up.� He tried to adjust his eyes only to see a
white man.� He had a plate of food and
fed Charles with his dirty, bare hands.�
It was a humiliation the likes of which Charles had never contemplated
before, to have be dependent upon the kindness of
another man for his very survival.� His
mind flashed to an image of what Black men might have had to endure but he
couldn�t hold the thought too long.� He
was too exhausted to fathom the concept that his experience was choreographed
but actual slaves didn�t have a safe word, there was no reprieve at the end of
a week, a month, a day, a decade, or a lifetime.� The white man snapped him out of his daydream
and said, �Dem 'ooman dun fuh smaa't. De buckruh dey whup baa.�� It was almost beyond his comprehension how
this white man was speaking that gibberish.�


&nbsp;

�Speak English, I don�t understand,� Charles pleaded.� What the hell was wrong with him?� Charles tried to comprehend what could have
happened to him in order for him to start communicating in the language of
these vicious people.� He remembered the
cryptic message on the Internet and realized that he had been reading some
variation of what these people were speaking.�
Was this man aiding him one of the men that chose to stay?� Why would anyone want to stay in this
hell?� Questions raced through his
mind.� 

&nbsp;

The man pulled a pouch from around his neck and put some
soothing salve on Charles� burns and put a container filled with fresh water in
the coffin slamming the lid closed again.�
Charles licked what rice and turtle meat he could from his lips and
tried his best to find some comfortable position in that tight, cramped space.� 

&nbsp;

He was not to get much sleep as the women would take turns
abusing him every couple of hours.� The
days ran together as his abuse rituals seemed to run together.� One woman applied an electric cattle prod to
his testicles and seemed amused at the sounds he made in response, at watching
his body contort and tremble with pain.�
Another tied him to a tree and covered his body with honey as she let
insects sting and bite him and left in him the oppressive sun like an ornament
on a lynching Christmas tree.� Once he
was beaten on the bottoms of his feet until he passed out and they seemed to
enjoy using his body as practice for their single tail whips, with which they
were quite expert.� He would be secured
to a large boulder and made to hold his asscheeks apart while they aimed for
the bull�s eye.� The pain was so intense
he knew that losing consciousness was his only chance to survive the sharp,
stinging blows.� 

&nbsp;

The women led him to the stables one day and made him lie
on a bale of hay.� A horse was brought
out of the stalls and he thought for sure he was going to have to serve as the
receptacle for his sperm in either his mouth or asscunt.� Instead they removed the bit from the horse�s
mouth and placed it directly into Charles� mouth and hooked him to a plow.� They made him work the fields like an animal,
whipping him every time he faltered.� The
salt from his sweat stung the cuts on his back and the sun burned his pale
flesh to a searing, hot red.� His body
wasn�t strong, he wasn�t muscular and well-built like
African men so he fell often, unable to move the earth as he was instructed to
do.� Every muscle in his body was sore,
every organ in his body suffered from the effects of malnourishment and
dehydration.� His flesh was covered in
bruises where he had been beaten, paddled, and whipped.� His cock hadn�t been hard in days, since he
left the comfort of the big house.� 

&nbsp;

Of course, he was raped every day.� It was brutal and vicious and always with
objects that could puncture his intestines and end his life, the handle of an
axe, an empty bottle of wine, an oversized vegetable
from the garden, whatever happened to be handy.�
He was always left bleeding from his rectum and his cock and balls
endured more punishment than he�d thought possible.� Metal sounds were shoved in his piss hole and heavy weights applied to his balls.� It was as if the women were free to
experiment on how much pain could inflict on his genitals short of
castration.� Many times, the Black
bitches held the blade of a knife or a rusty razor to his nuts and threatened
to make him a eunuch if he uttered a sound.�
In the back of his mind, he realized that under other circumstances he
would have been getting pleasure from this treatment but at some point, he
understood that this experience had nothing to do with sex.� This was about the fear and horror of real
enslavement.� He remained silent, even in
the face of his manhood being removed and decided to do whatever he had to do
in order to live.� That was his only goal--
to live to another day with the hopes that he would be able to go home.� Charles had become a real slave.� 

&nbsp;

Sleep was at a premium as he was never allowed to get more
than an hour at a time.� By the fourth, or fifth day, the women stopped locking him in his
coffin and wouldn�t put on his leg and wrist restraints.� His friend would come nightly, giving him
food and water to keep him alive; never uttering a word in English.� Charles came to expect abuse as routine and
the pain was transformed into something other than pleasurable, other than
ache; he would leave his body in order to escape the sensations and a part of
him died inside every day.� 

&nbsp;

On day six, he was awakened with the sun and taken to a
pond to bathe.� The water was cold but it
felt good.� He was given lye soap and he
washed his hair and body with the harsh smelling bar.� It felt good to rid himself
of the stink that oozed from his pores.�
Once finished, he was given a metal cup filled with oil to apply to his
body.� He did his best to rub it into
every inch of his skin because he appreciated the luxury of the feel on his
aching body.� There was a pile of clothes
for him to put on, pants, a shirt, and even shoes.� He stood taller in his outfit, feeling
superior to the handful of white men who were wearing their burlap frocks.� Breakfast was plentiful.� Fresh fruit, pancakes with syrup, eggs,
bacon, toast, juice and coffee satisfied his appetite.� He gorged himself so much he was afraid he
would throw it all up.� 

&nbsp;

By mid-morning, he was taken to the big house and led to
the master bedroom.� It was complete with
all the Victorian drama of the period, a four-poster bed, a large fireplace,
windows and a balcony that looked out over the property.� He felt unworthy to sit on the furniture so
he just stood, waiting for what he was sure was going
to be an inspection or something by Mistress Emmanuelle.� 

&nbsp;

�Have you enjoyed your stay thus far, Chuck,� she said,
breezing into the room with melodramatic flair?�


&nbsp;

Charles couldn�t answer.�
He�s hated every second of the experience since he stepped on the boat
but he was terrified that if he didn�t answer affirmatively he�d be subjected
to harsh punishment more severe than anything he�d endured before.� It was also the first time in days he�d heard
his native tongue.� His brain misfired
and shut down.�� Emmanuelle took it in
stride and continued on.� �Take off your shirt, let me see your markings.�� 

&nbsp;

�Yes, Mistress.�� He unbuttoned his shirt and felt the first
signs of arousal that he�d felt since leaving her office the day they were
introduced.� She circled his body;
lightly brushing her fingers across the welts and bruises.� Her touch was extremely gentle and Charles
was falling victim to her manipulations.�
The only permanent mark that he�d received was the brand but the most
painful torture he�d received was mental.�


&nbsp;

She unbuttoned his pants and inspected her mark.� �Nice, it should heal really well.� Remind me to get a picture of it before you
leave.�� She stroked his cock, producing
an erection but Charles was determined to deny her the satisfaction of knowing
he was mentally aroused.� What she had
done to him was in fact criminal and he only hoped to make it one more day so
that he could call the police and have her arrested.�� He wanted his dignity back, his humanity
back.� 

&nbsp;

Mistress Emmanuelle started to undress in front of
Charles.� His jaw dropped as he saw her
sexy body revealed and once again he was victim to his weak resolution.� She stripped down to a leather corset, black,
silk stockings, and patent leather high heels.�
She bent over to retrieve something and he was graced with a perfect
view of her ass this time.� Within a
second he flashed back to the brazen display of power when she pissed in the
mouth of that boy. His true nature of a sub emerged and he longed to place his mouth
there and worship her, to taste her musky asshole, smell its rich fragrance,
and clean her completely.� 

&nbsp;

She turned to face him and she was wearing a strapon the
dimensions of which seemed to compare to the horse.� It was pitch black and over a foot in length
and it appeared to be as thick as a beer can.�


&nbsp;

�Suck it.�

&nbsp;

Her instructions were clear and concise and he was on his
knees worshipping the dark phallus before he could rationalize if it was right
or wrong.� She pumped his mouth full of
the silicone dick and his sluttish nature began to rise.� He began trying to get the entire length in
his mouth, spit drooled from the corners of his mouth and he was fully erect
and throbbing.� He hated himself for how
quickly he betrayed his principles for his libido.� She encouraged his behavior, taunting him,
teasing him.� �You dirty fucking
whore.� Look at you.� I�ve reduced you to nothing and here you are,
sucking this big black dick like a cheap tramp.�
Now you know why white men are truly inferior.� Now you see the evidence.� Your gross, pale body is pathetic, your cock
is repulsive, you can�t do any work, and you wouldn�t survive a month if you
had to be a real slave.� And through it
all, you�re still here sucking my big, black dick like the little bitch you
really are.�� 

&nbsp;

Charles hated that woman more than he hated anyone else in
life at that very moment.� If she wasn�t
so right, if her words weren�t so true, it would have made his slutty actions
that much less humiliating.� She was
right.� He knew that if Blacks had
enslaved whites, that whites would have never be able
to endure the horrors that Blacks had done for centuries.� The simple fact that he was still ruled by
his sex drive, in the midst of complete psychological annihilation was evidence
that he was demented and inferior.� His
revelations made him suck that much harder.�
He sucked that dick like he was paying homage to every Black man who had
ever been whipped and emasculated, for every Black woman who had ever been
raped and degraded.� He was sucking that
strapon to show his inferiority but not just sexually, he knew in his core that
only someone pathetic and subhuman could find reason to be aroused by being
degraded.� 

&nbsp;

Before he knew what was happening, he heard himself
begging to be used.� �Rape me, beat me, use me.� Do whatever
you want to me.� Fuck me please.� Make me your bitch.� Own me.�
PLEASE.� Own me.� Release me from my bondage of pretending to
be the great, almighty white man.�
Torture me.� Do anything you
want.�� His pleas were becoming more
urgent, more insistent.� �Fuck me like
the dirty, filthy, white pig I am.� I bow
to you; I worship you.� I love you.�

&nbsp;

He was sobbing like a baby and terrified beyond
measure.� The room was spinning and he�s
freely given up the last bit of self-respect he�d tried to grasp onto.� His boypussy was throbbing to be violated and
used in ways that made his week-long ordeal seem like playtime in the
park.� 

&nbsp;

Mistress Emmanuelle grabbed his throat and began to choke
him.� He struggled but it was only the
remnants of a fight of flight instinct.�
His mind and soul wanted her to choke him; he wanted her to control his
life and his breath.� Just as he felt
himself passing out, he remembered her words of how she was going to make him
pray for the sweet release of death.� In
that split second, in that epiphanal moment, he gained knowledge and
understanding of what it was to be a true slave, not just a sexual
submissive.� 

&nbsp;

His unconsciousness, the literal state at least, didn�t
last very long.� He awoke to find himself
secured to the huge four-poster bed with his legs tied so that they were back
over his head and his cock was aimed directly at his mouth.� Emmanuelle climbed on the bed and straddled
his body, giving him a perfect view of her pussy and ass from below.� She placed the gigantic head of the strapon
on his hole and began pushing it in.� Not
having a reason to be gentle, she stabbed and pumped the thick phallus deeply,
causing the tender ring of muscle that protected his anus to give way to the
marauding intruder.� 

&nbsp;

�You fucking white bitch.�
I own you.� I own your ass.� I own you so completely I can do anything I
want to you and you won�t say a word.�
That�s power.� I�ve taken my true
role as your superior.� This is the way
it�s supposed to have been, with me controlling you.� You stupid, worthless,
pathetic, disgusting, nasty, insignificant worm.� Does that hurt? Does it?�� 

&nbsp;

Charles didn�t have to answer, she knew it hurt him in a
way he�d never felt with any pro Domme before.�
The physical pain was blinding but the psychological pain was debilitating.� �Yes Mistress,� was his only response as he
felt her plunge deeper and deeper into his guts and pierce
his very soul with her cruelty. 

&nbsp;

He awoke on day seven in a down filled bed and new clothes
for him to wear and his personal belongings by the bed.� Breakfast was prepared for him and if anyone
had taken a snapshot of that scene they would have thought that he had just
awoken from a week of rest and relaxation at a spa.� Charles knew differently.� He didn�t know how he was going to go back to
his normal life.� He didn�t know how he
was going to go back to a society that existed off the fallacy that he was
superior.� He swung his feet over the
edge of the bed and sat there for a second trying to steady himself.� Walking to the balcony, he saw an electric
golf cart pulling up, dragging a white man behind, screaming and yelling about
how he was going to sue anyone who touched him.�
It was a hard choice for him to pack his bags but he did and he wanted
to thank Mistress Emmanuelle for the experience but thanks weren�t
appropriate.� She�d destroyed his reality
and his life would never be the same.� He
sat at the old-fashioned dressing table and wrote on the parchment stationary,
�I will spread the word about the great works that you are doing here.� Your humble slave,
Charles.��
