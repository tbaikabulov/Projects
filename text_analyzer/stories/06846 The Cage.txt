Dear Slave,

Yes.

Your Master



 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathanial made the turn onto Eve&#8217;s street, the street lights were just starting to come on as dusk slowly crept up on the quiet California town.&nbsp; He pulled into her driveway, put the transmission in park and cut the engine.&nbsp; He reached over to the passenger seat and slipped the strip of leather into his back pocket, then got out of the car and walked up to the front door.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As usual, Eve had the door open before he could knock, for she&#8217;d been sitting in the front room waiting for him.&nbsp; She invited him in with a smile, Nathanial stepped over the threshold and closed the door behind him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eve was wearing form-fitting jeans, white sneakers, and a pink tank top.&nbsp; Nathanial gripped the back of her neck and drew her into him for a kiss.&nbsp; At first the kiss was light, innocent even, but then he pushed her against the door, while his tongue probed her open mouth his right hand found her throat, his other went to her crotch.&nbsp; He could feel the heat of her passion through the jeans.&nbsp; Both of his hands tightened their grip on her, his right around her throat, his left pressed against her sex.&nbsp; Eve moaned into his mouth, her eyes fluttered closed while her hands hung at her sides.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathanial pulled back, kept his hand at her throat, and looked into her eyes.&nbsp; He loved what he saw there, pleasure, even in the face of pain.&nbsp; She loved what he did to her, like no woman could, and he considered himself lucky to have found one such as her: a nymphomaniac with a masochistic streak a mile wide.&nbsp; He loved it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You like that, don&#8217;t you?� Nathanial asked, questioning her as he always liked to, which in itself is a form of degradation and humiliation.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked up at him, �Yes Master,� she said innocently, still a bit woozy from his little assault.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He let go of her throat, �Good,� and reached into his back pocket and pulled out her leather collar, the symbol of her ownership and his dominance over her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He wrapped it around her throat and buckled it under her chin, then roughly gripping her jaw, he turned her head to the side and nuzzled his face against the side of hers and whispered, �I&#8217;m glad you like it, because I like doing it to you.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m going to do more, much, much more, my little slave.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Still gripping her jaw he pulled his face back enough to turn hers back towards him, then he kissed her again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Breaking the kiss he stepped back enough to let her stand up straight, �Are you ready to go slave?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Master,� Eve answered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good, then lets go,� Nathanial said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathanial opened the door while Eve grabbed her purse, he held it open for her, his chivalrous nature was never overridden by his dominant side.&nbsp; Outside, Eve locked the door, then returned her keys to her purse.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathanial took hold of Eve&#8217;s hand and led the way to his car, holding her hand was his way of leading her in public.&nbsp; He&#8217;d put her collar on but hadn&#8217;t brought the leash.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He even opened her door for her, then shut it once she&#8217;s settled in the seat, somewhat chivalrous but also not letting her be independent.&nbsp; It was all part of the game.&nbsp; Of course Eve was a strong woman, never timid, and definitely going places in life.&nbsp; But her sex life was a little different from her public life, for some reason, possibly unknown even to her, she chose to submit to another.&nbsp; She chose to hand over her body, heart, and soul to one in which she placed the utmost trust.&nbsp; Some would even say that that trust was betrayed, because to someone unaccustomed to such things, the things Nathanial does to Eve would seem cruel, even evil.&nbsp; But many people not of the BDSM lifestyle do not know that the �cruel� and �evil� things that Nathanial does and Eve allows to be done come naturally, and bring about a high that no drug could ever achieve.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a fine line they tread, one relationship&#8217;s abuse is another relationship&#8217;s sex, but a fine line that they are compelled to walk.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathanial walked around to the other side of the car, opened the door and sat in the driver&#8217;s seat.&nbsp; He looked over, admiring Eve, the black leather collar a startlingly attractive contrast to her outfit, normal clothes but with a sexy accessory.&nbsp; She noticed him looking at her and smiled.&nbsp; Nathanial leaned over the center console, hooked his right index finger through the D-ring on the collar and pulled Eve into another forcefully passionate kiss.&nbsp; With his other hand he teased her left breast, squeezing until he felt the barbell nipple rings through the fabric.&nbsp; She moaned in answer, loving the authoritative tug on her collar and the sharp pain he caused at her breast.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With one last pinch, Nathanial settled back in his seat, started the engine and backed out of the driveway.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They made small talk on the way to his place, asking about each others&#8217; day.&nbsp; Before long they were pulling into his own driveway.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathanial smiled as he reached over and caressed Missy&#8217;s face, she closed her eyes and sighed, enjoying his touch.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without a word, Nathanial killed the engine and pulled the keys from the ignition as he got out of the car.&nbsp; He made his way around the front of the car and opened Eve&#8217;s door, becoming more aggressive, he reached in and gripped her just above the elbow and pulled her from the vehicle.&nbsp; Shutting the door and turning towards the house, he pulled Eve along the pathway leading to the front door.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathanial unlocked the door and forcefully shoved Eve into the darkened entrance hallway.&nbsp; Nathanial shut the door and turned on the overhead light, then just stood looking at Eve for a moment.&nbsp; Then, without a word, he turned her and shoved her face-first against the wall, leaning his weight against her to keep her there he pressed his forearm into the back of her neck.&nbsp; Pinned tight against the wall, Eve was forced to turn her head to the left, Nathanial, his mouth inches from her ear, intimately whispered to her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh my beautiful little Slave, I have a surprise for you,� he pressed his lower body against her ass, letting her feel some of what she had to look forward to, �but for activities this weekend, I&#8217;ve decided I&#8217;m not going to let you where any clothes.&nbsp; You&#8217;re my play thing, my sex toy, you don&#8217;t need clothes.&nbsp; So let&#8217;s get you out of that sexy little outfit.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With that, he eased his weight off her and reached down to the bottom of her tank top.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Arms up,� he commanded.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She complied, holding her hands above her head and he pulled the tank top up, revealing her stomach, then her skimpy little white bra.&nbsp; The tank top finally slid past the collar, over Missy&#8217;s head, and ended up on the floor where Nathanial discarded it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathanial&#8217;s hands went to the clasp of her bra next, with a quick flick, he unhooked it and snatched it from her body.&nbsp; Eve shivered as she was suddenly rendered naked from the waist up.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Next his hands went to the belt around Eve&#8217;s waist, he unbuckled it with a jerk, then pulled the button and zipper open, putting the matching skimpy white panties on display.&nbsp; Nathanial smiled as he gave her choice of underwear an appraising look, then bent over and pulled her shoes and socks off.&nbsp; With Eve&#8217;s footwear out of the way, he started sliding the tight jeans over her hips, then her lower legs, until she stepped out of them and stood before him, clad only in the small white thong, leaving nothing to the imagination as Nathanial admired her ass.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Where did you get those panties?� Nathanial asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Victoria&#8217;s Secret, Master,� Eve answered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathanial spun her around so that she faced him again and shoved her back up against the wall with his left hand against her throat and said, �We&#8217;ll have to get you another pair, because as much as I like them, I like doing this more.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With that, he reached behind him and pulled the Smith and Wesson HRT from its sheath, a knife with a four inch blade and gleaming brushed steel edges.&nbsp; Eve&#8217;s eyes widened, her breath sped up as did her fluttering heart as she saw the blade in her Master&#8217;s hand.&nbsp; He slowly brought the blade to her left breast, tapped it against the barbell nipple ring, than slid the flat across the nipple itself.&nbsp; After watching her flinch from the contact, Nathanial slid the tip of the blade down the front of her body to her waist.&nbsp; He gripped the fabric covering her pussy and the blade barely made contact with the string running between her legs when it severed.&nbsp; Nathanial looked into her face and saw the anticipation there, she wanted him to cut the panties from her body, to leave her completely naked before him while he stood clothed and holding a very sharp knife.&nbsp; With that thought, he pulled the string away from her skin, placed the knife between it and her flesh, and made the last cut.&nbsp; The string that could barely be called underwear in the first place fell away.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before her underwear hit the floor Nathanial had replaced the knife in its sheath and resumed the position he&#8217;s first taken when he&#8217;d embraced Eve earlier that evening, his right hand pressing into her throat, his left hand at her pussy.&nbsp; Only this time with no clothing in the way, Nathanial slid his fingers inside her, and quite easily since she was so wet.&nbsp; He knew she would be, the knife-play was as much for her as it was for him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathanial only fingered her for a moment as he had more in store for his little slave.&nbsp; Taking his fingers from her, he reached over to the shelf where he&#8217;d left the chain leash before he&#8217;d left to pick his slave up.&nbsp; He took his hand from her throat so he could clip the leash to her collar, then let the length of chain hang between them as he held the leather loop handle.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Alright slave, here&#8217;s the rule for the weekend.&nbsp; When I tell you to go somewhere, whether it be on your own or on the end of your leash, you will crawl on your hands and knees.&nbsp; Do you understand?� Nathanial asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With no hesitation, Eve answered, �Yes Master.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good girl,� Nathanial said as he put his hand on the back of her neck and gently but firmly pushed her to the floor.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathanial stood there looking down at Eve, on all fours on the floor, as if inspecting his merchandise.&nbsp; He liked what he saw.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then with a tug on her leash, �Come on slave, this way,� then started leading her down the hall with her crawling at his side.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathanial had left candles burning in his room, just enough light for Eve to make out the surprise that he had told her about, as they crossed the threshold she saw in the corner, about waist-high, was a cage.&nbsp; It was the size of a dog cage but had bars similar to prison bars.&nbsp; It looked like there was about enough room for her to turn around in place on her hands and knees but that was about it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathanial walked Eve right up to it and opened the cage door, �Welcome to your new home for the weekend princess,� he said tauntingly.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With that, he unclipped the leash from her collar, then when she hesitated, gave her a sharp slap on the ass.&nbsp; That was all the urging she needed, she crawled inside and turned around to watch as he shut and locked the cage door behind her.&nbsp; He secured the cage door with a padlock, then stood up and set the key on the dresser.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Make yourself comfortable slave, I&#8217;ll be back in a while,� he said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathanial turned and walked out of the room, barely able to suppress the smile that wanted to break out.&nbsp; Of course there was nothing that he would rather do than play with his slave, but there was no point in getting a cage if he wasn&#8217;t going to keep her in it for a while.&nbsp; So he went to find something to preoccupy himself with quietly in another part of the house so she could feel isolated in the cage.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meanwhile, Eve looked around at her new surroundings, as cramped as they were.&nbsp; She felt so objectified, caged wearing nothing but a dog collar, like a pet that her Master had bought at a pet store and brought home, and she liked it.&nbsp; With nothing to distract her, all she could do was imagine some of the things her Master would do to her when he returned.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After a while, Nathanial&#8217;s patience ran out.&nbsp; He started down the hall and into his bedroom.&nbsp; Eve looked at him expectantly from her place on the cage floor, she&#8217;d been laying down but rose nervously to her hands and knees as her Master walked into the room.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathanial retrieved the key from the dresser and stepped to the cage, unlocked it and set the padlock and key back on the dresser.&nbsp; He picked up the leash and clipped it to her collar once more, with a tug he urged her out of the cage.&nbsp; Still on her hands and knees, Eve crawled out into the room, Nathanial led her over to the foot of the bed, sat down on the edge and unclipped the leash.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Looking down at his slave, he said, �Slave, over on the end table, there&#8217;s a flogger, will you fetch it for me?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Master,� Eve said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eve crawled over to the end table to the right of the bed, she picked the flogger up and put it in her mouth, gripping the handle with her teeth, like a bit gag, turned and crawled back to her Master.&nbsp; Having arrived back where he sat perched on the edge of the bed, she sat back on her heels, still on her hands and knees, and presented the flogger to him with her mouth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Taking the flogger from her mouth, Nathanial said, �Good girl.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathanial stood up, then gripping her by the hair, pulled Eve to her feet and up onto the bed, he pushed her face down onto the bed.&nbsp; He stepped over to the dresser and pulled a length of rope from one of the drawers, then moved back to the bed.&nbsp; Without a word, he pulled her hands together behind her back and bound them tightly there at the small of her back.&nbsp; Next he pulled a ball gag from the drawer, turned and forced it into her mouth, then buckled it behind her head, leaving her unable to protest or speak.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He picked up the flogger and said, �Stick your ass in the air slave.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She did as he told her, working up to her knees, her face pressed down into the bed, exposing herself to him in the crudest of ways.&nbsp; He paused long enough to take the sight that she created in, a woman in a helpless and precarious position, nude, collared, bound, and gagged.&nbsp; Nathanial found nothing sexier than what was before him at that moment.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With a deft cracking motion he brought the flogger lashing across Eve&#8217;s cute ass.&nbsp; She cried into her gag at the sharp pain, then again as he whipped her once more.&nbsp; Nathanial enjoyed her cries of pain mixed with pleasure mixed with anticipation for more, and so he continued the onslaught.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eve felt herself becoming wet again, getting turned on by the pain her Master was inflicting on her, by the bondage he&#8217;d placed her in.&nbsp; Her fate was out of her hands, she was to be abused by this demanding man, and she enjoyed every second of it immensely.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Soon Eve&#8217;s ass was glowing bright red and hot to the touch, and Nathanial could restrain himself no longer.&nbsp; His slave becoming aroused was no secret to him, he had a perfect view of her bent over before him, her glistening pussy, the juices dripping down her inner thighs, all from the beating he&#8217;d just given her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He unbuckled his belt and pulled his pants open, pulled his underwear down far enough to release himself as he crawled up onto the bed behind Eve.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She felt him getting behind her, getting ready to mount her from behind, she moaned just at the thought of penetration, she was so hot.&nbsp; Nathanial slapped her ass as he slid inside of her and they both moaned from the shared pleasure.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eve&#8217;s bound hands opened and closed spaspatically as Nathanial grabbed her hips and started rocking and grinding himself into her.&nbsp; Eve was moaning louder and louder into the gag and it wasn&#8217;t long before she came, her right of speech taken away she couldn&#8217;t ask for permission, only ride the rising tide of orgasm until it enveloped her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathanial kept fucking her and she lost count of how many times she came, she was so wet, so hot, and he was so hard and rough.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Nathanial decided that he was ready to cum, he pulled her onto her back with her head hanging over the edge of the bed upside down.&nbsp; He pulled the ball gag from her mouth, it hung around her neck like a bizarre necklace as he commanded her to keep her mouth open.&nbsp; Then he entered her mouth and fucked her face, hard.&nbsp; She choked and gagged as he pleasured himself with her mouth, then he came in her mouth, down her throat.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After he was finished he pulled his cock from her mouth, watched as she swallowed all of his cum, then crammed the ball gag back into her mouth.&nbsp; He pulled her up from the bed and shoved her to her knees on the floor, he untied her hands and pushed her forward so she was on all fours.&nbsp; Then he clipped the leash to her collar and walked her back to the cage, herded her inside and locked the door again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then Nathanial walked off to kill more time before taking her out again for more training.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eve sat in gagged silence in her cage, waiting for her Master to return.
