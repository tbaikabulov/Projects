She opened her eyes to a plain, white room. A low ceiling and tight walls made her feel chlostraphobic, and she squeezed her eyes shut, pinching her arm to check if she was having a bad dream. Nothing happened. The walls were made from a matte plastic material, the same as the floor and the ceiling. There were strings of a glowing, cloudy gas that illuminated the room a blank white. She looked up and down, round and round the room trying to see where she was, turning in circles until she was dizzy. She suddenly noticed she was wearing nothing but a hospital gown, a washed-out pink. Silently, a tear fell down onto her foot, hitting hard. She shut her eyes, covered her ears, and screamed. She cried for help, but nobody came, and even after her voice was hoarse and desperate, still nothing changed. She saw a pink band on her ankle, plastic - the type found at a hospital to identify patients. This was no different. It had her name, and an ID number.
Samantha West, #702189
Suddenly the light turned blue, and the wall behind her split into two, sliding apart. Four men in white uniform turned into her space, then stopped a few metres in front of her. One stepped forward and spoke in a calm, gentle voice.
"Good morning Samantha, I'm Daniel. Welcome to the Center for Sexual Correction and Enhancement. I hope you had a restful night. We've got a lot of work to do, and I trust you'll give your full cooperation with us for the duration of your stay."
Samantha stepped back, her muscles tensing.
"Come now," Daniel spoke to her soothingly, "there's nothing to be afraid of. You're going to be just fine. Now why don't you come with us?" He stepped towards her, and she made a second retreat, her back touching the wall behind her.
"Stay away from me." She said sharply, putting her left foot forward and ducking down into a fighting stance."
"Samantha, don't try to fight us. What you see heroes do in movies will only get you hurt in reality." He came up close to her and reached out to touch her arm. She'd got him where she wanted: close. Before he could react, her fingers had already jabbed him in his right eye. She brought her other hand palm-first, crashing into his jaw, before she slapped him hard in the ear. He fell to the ground, disorientated and groaning, half-conscious. It had happened within a second, and the other men hadn't had time to react before she came charging at them. The second man made a lunge for her, but she turned round and brought her knee up hard between his legs, making him crumple to the ground. The two remaining men grabbed her arms and tried to force her against the wall, but she jumped up and kicked against the wall, knocking them all backwards and falling down on top of them. But as she elbow backwards into the side of the taller man's head, she felt the prick of a needle, and looked round to see one of the men underneath her had put a syringe to her arm, and immediately she began to lose her vision, and then her hearing, and finally the world sank away.

"Wake up Samantha."
She felt groggy from the injection, but seeing Daniel jerked her back into reality. His eye was red and he had a bruise on the side of his face from where they'd relocated his jaw. She was belted into what seemed to be a dentists chair. This was a new room, still white with plastic walls, floor and ceiling, but there were cupboards, a sink, a shower and a table.
"I had a look through your file," Daniel opened a large folder with WEST, SAMANTHA printed on the front. He flicked through twenty or so pages before finding the part he wanted. "Here it is. I probably should have read this before collecting you, but it's all in the past now anyway. Caution: This subject is competant with unarmed combat and small firearms. A little late now, don't you think?" He chuckled to himself and turned straight to the last page. "Hmm... sounds like we've got a nasty bit of work to do here." He snapped the folder shut and put it on the floor. "Nevermind, let's get to it."
He went over to the cupboards and took out a metal tray, then went about filling it with different items, humming as he went. A small butt-plug, a long thin flexible pipe, surgical clamps, jars of different coloured liquids, syringes, a ballgag, a control box of some sort and electrical wires. He put the tray on the table and wheeled it over to Samantha. She didn't struggle anymore - there was no point. She couldn't get out of the tight bonds, and there was no way out of this room even if she could. He put the gag in her mouth, then took her gown off, revealing her 32D breasts and tight pussy.
"Very nice." Daniel commented on her. He then took out the grey liquid, and dipped the butt plug in it. "A lubricant." he explained. Then he pressed the plug against her ass. "Don't resist it - believe me it's much easier if you simply relax." She relaxed slightly, and he slid the plug in where it settled nicely. "Perfect fit." He then took a syringe and put a tiny thin needle on the end, then filled it with a blue liquid. This one was watery and glowed slightly. "This is going to hurt I won't lie, but it's all for better future. With one gloved finger, he pulled back her hood and slowly pushed the needle into her clit. She let out a muffled scream as he injected the liquid into her clit before pulling out the needle. "This is a fantastic chemical - it increases the sensitivity of the nerves in the treated area by six times. I'm not exactly sure how it works - I'll have to ask our chemist when I next see him." A tear rolled down her cheek and rested on her lips. He took another syringe and this time filled it with a third liquid. He stood up and walked round to her head. "This one kills the nerves in the back of your throat, which will permenantly stop any gag reflexes during oral sex." He took out the gag, pushed the needle in the back of her throat before pulling it quickly out. It didn't hurt as much as she expected at first, but a few seconds later a wave of immense pain swept through her throat as if someone was grating away from the inside. She bucked in the chair but the belts held her strongly. Then he went back to the tray and took out four wires. He connected two between her nipples and the control box, and then from the other side of the box he attached one to her sore clit, and then the last he pushed up her pussy and onto her G-spot. "What this will do is link the nerves in your breasts those that are in your clitoris and your g-spot. Once I send a small current through, your breasts will become sexually pleasurable beyond your imagination. You won't feel a thing - the current is so small, even a fly wouldn't notice." He pressed a button on his control box, then disconnected the wires. Sure enough, Samantha hadn't felt a thing. He waited fifteen, maybe twenty seconds, then bent down and lightly ran his tongue over her left breast. She gasped for air as a wave of pleasure rocked through her body, making her drip over the seat. He smiled at her. �It worked. I'd do the same to the rest of your body but I'm under strict orders to only link your breasts and the inside of your ass. Apparently, your owner wants to be able to rub his dick against your stomach without you making much noise.�
�My owner?� Samantha asked, scared.
�That's what I said. You see, this is a business, nothing more. Import export.�
�What's that supposed to mean?�
�We import young girls like you, from scouts who work for our sister company, and we export perfect, submissive slaves with whatever... modifications the client wants. And unlucky for you, the list of alterations your new owner has requested is very long indeed. I'd say there's at least a few months of work before you're ready to for psychological conditioning.�
He made a few ticks on his checkboard, then stopped suddenly as he read over the next enhancement. �Dear oh dear, you are in for a bumpy ride� he mumbled quietly. Samantha tensed in the chair. She'd heard. He reached in his pocket and took out a small radio. He pressed a button and spoke down the receiver. �Adrian, I need two white-tip syringes, 100ml ethanol, 900ml water, a scalpel, suture needle and some stitching thread. Oh and send down modification kit five as well.� He waited a few seconds before a distorted reply came back, confirming what had been ordered. It was as if Daniel had ordered a takeaway, except this order wasn't food. Samantha waited in silence, unable to move. Five minutes later, a short, fat woman with her hair tied in a tight but came through the door, pushing a trolley before her. Daniel thanked her, and she left in silence, accepting the thank you with nothing but a quick nod.
He opened a metal box on the trolley, labelled �MODIFICATION KIT #5� in bold, stencilled letters. 
He took the bottle of water and poured in the ethanol, then shook it up to mix the liquids together. �Drink up� he said, taking off her gag. She knew there was no point in resisting. It tasted foul, but she kept swallowing until it was gone. Already she felt light headed. Then Daniel stepped back, and set a timer for fifteen minutes.
They waited in silence until the timer rang out. The world was spinning. Her situation didn't feel so bad all of a sudden. She was drunk, and there was nothing she could do, or wanted to do, to change that. He took out a small device that resembled something of a dust-devil, except it was see-through and there was a small hole in the back of it. He took one of the syringes and filled it with the same blue liquid he'd injected into her clit earlier. Then he pushed the syringe through the hole and twisted some screws to secure it. There was a small silicone section around the hole that enabled him to move the syringe around inside the device. Then he went over to Samantha and pressed the nozzle against her pussy hole. Pressing a button, it started sucking. Her juices sprayed over the insides of the chamber, and she moaned with the pleasure. Then he turned up the power, and pulled at her cunt, and slowly her cunt was turned inside out, just enough so that her g-spot was visible at the opening. Holding the power there, he held the device with one hand, and handled the syringe with the other. He positioned the needle over her g-spot, then pushed in. Samantha screamed out, shaking with pain as he injected the liquid into her spot. Even in her state, she had never felt pain quite like it. It was even worse than the shot in her clit, and as more fluid entered her g-spot, the more painful it became. By the time he syringe was empy, she was rocking back and forth, begging for Daniel to stop. He had no intention of doing such a thing. �You'd better prepare yourself. This is the first of three.� Samantha's eyes widened with terror as she realised that the worst was still to come. He kept the machine running and replaced the syringe. There was an airlock so that the hole closed up when a syringe wasn't inserted. The second injection sent her into a fit of pain, shaking uncontrollably, screaming out for it to stop. It never stopped. Each moment was worse than the last, each millilitre was twice as painful. When the third injection was done, he turned off the machine and threw the empy syringes into a sharp-box for needles. The pain subsided, and she closed her eyes, letting out a sigh of relief.
�You need to rest,� Daniel said softly, �I'll be back in a few hours to continue. In the meantime, try and get some sleep.� She was exhausted from the pain and drunk from the ethanol, and didn't need much encouragement to close her eyes.

Three hours later
�Wake up Samantha�. She jolted awake. This was a new man she hadn't seen before. �My name's Brett. I've come to test your sensitivity.� He unzipped his pants and pulled them down and took them off, the did the same with his white boxers. She was impressed � there was at least seven inches on him and he only had a semi. He could tell what she was thinking and smiled at her. �I get that look a lot. But every time they never expect what's coming. It's going to feel better than you can imagine, but that's what I tell all the others, and they're still never prepared.� He walked around the chair then climbed on top of her chest. Then he moved up and pushed his cock into her mouth. She knew there was nothing she could to stop him, so she opened her jaw, inviting his dick inside of her. She ran her tongue over his throbbing head, his dick growing harder. Then he pushed down her throat as far as it could go. Sure enough, there was no gag reflex. A small dribble of precum rolled down her throat. �Impressive.� He said, pulling out and climbing off from her. He walked round and stood between her legs, holding his cock in front of her pussy. �Ready?� He asked her. She gave him a nod and he laughed. �No you're not. Nobody ever is!� Then he pushed inside of her and she gave out a scream of pleasure as waves of sexual stimulation rocked through her body. He was right � there was nothing that could have prepared her for this. It was beyond anything she had ever imagined. He pumped in and out of her pussy, making her cry out. Within seconds she was squirting over the floor, shaking against her restraints. He kept fucking her for what seemed like hours, each thrust feeling even better than the last. What she felt was indescribable! Perhaps her life wouldn't be so bad after all! Finally, he cummed inside of her tight pussy, as she orgasmed for the sixth, maybe seventh time. She was out of control, screaming, rocking from side to side, her eyes tightly shut and her muscles in spasm. �I told you.� Brett said, pulling out from her cunt, a dribble of his cum mixed with her juices oozing out from her pussy and dripping onto the floor. She gasped for air as she tried to comprehend what she had felt. �One last thing.� He said, and walked up to her side. He brushed a hand over her tits and she screamed out, squirting out his cum and in a torrent of her juice, spraying over the floor. He smiled at her. �I think this concludes the test for now.� He said no more and walked out the room, leaving her dazed in a wave of euphoria.
