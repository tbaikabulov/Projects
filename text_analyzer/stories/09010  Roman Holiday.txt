Chapter 1

&#8220;Brandi!&#8221; shouted Diana with exasperation in her voice.&nbsp; &#8220;Come over here!&#8221;

Diana shook her head in disbelief at what she had just seen.&nbsp; But as the captain of the lacrosse team, she had to do something about it.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t afford to let something like that happen in a game.&nbsp; It could get a player kicked out of the game which would be bad for the team.&nbsp; And this year, Saxbury College had a very good chance of winning a national championship.

Not only that, but it could result in someone getting seriously hurt.&nbsp; And worst of all, it would tarnish Saxbury&#8217;s reputation for fair play.

Saxbury College was a girl&#8217;s school in northern Connecticut.&nbsp; It was small with only two thousand students but it was very elite and it was known for its high quality education.&nbsp; It was also known for its great sports teams.

Diana was a senior at the college.&nbsp; Not only was she smart but she was very athletic.&nbsp; This year, she had already been the captain of the cross country team and the archery team.&nbsp; Now, in her final months of her undergraduate career, she was leading the lacrosse team which was unbeaten so far this year.

She didn&#8217;t look like your typical athlete.&nbsp; She was not big and she did not appear all that muscular.&nbsp; The pretty blonde was only five feet four inches tall and she looked more like a cheerleader than an athlete.&nbsp; But she was fast and she was wiry and she was smart and those traits helped her to be the leading scorer on the team this year.

The big hulking freshman walked over to her slowly, obviously trying to irritate Diana.&nbsp; &#8220;What did you want, Big Tits?&#8221; asked Brandi as she stopped in front of the captain.&nbsp; Brandi was almost a foot taller than Diana and was easily twice her weight.&nbsp; But Diana did not let the size intimidate her.

Diana gasped.&nbsp; &#8220;Big Tits?&#8221;&nbsp; She looked down at her chest in response to see what the freshman was talking about.&nbsp; She did have nice breasts but they weren&#8217;t big.&nbsp; She only wore a C-cup bra although, on her slender body, her breasts did look disproportionately large.&nbsp; Currently, they were being held by a sports bra which actually made them seem smaller than normal with the way that they were compressed by the tight material.

&#8220;What&#8217;s with the Big Tits?&#8221; demanded Diana, irritated at the cocky freshman.

&#8220;I just call them as I see them,&#8221; replied Brandi nonchalantly.&nbsp; &#8220;You got some big tits.&nbsp; Not that I mind, though.&nbsp; I like girls with big tits.&#8221;

&#8220;Freshmen!&#8221; muttered Diana as she shook her head in disgust.&nbsp; She would deal with Brandi&#8217;s rude behavior later, though.&nbsp; Right now, she had a playing infraction to address and that was the most important thing at the moment.

&#8220;I saw what you did to Heather, Brandi,&#8221; Diana started.&nbsp; &#8220;That was a blatantly illegal move that would have gotten you kicked out of a game.&#8221;

&#8220;It stopped her from scoring, though, didn&#8217;t it?&#8221; was Brandi&#8217;s response.&nbsp; &#8220;That&#8217;s my job.&#8221;

Brandi played defense for the team.&nbsp; While Diana was an attacker where speed and wit and agility were important, Brandi&#8217;s position favored size and the courage to put your body between a flailing stick and the goal.

&#8220;Your job is to defend the goal,&#8221; instructed Diana.&nbsp; &#8220;Not to maim our opponent.&#8221;

Diana had witnessed Brandi&#8217;s infraction moments earlier.&nbsp; Brandi was out of position, as she frequently was, Diana had observed.&nbsp; There was no way that she could have legally stopped Heather from scoring.&nbsp; So instead, Brandi had swung her stick like a baseball bat and struck Heather across the backs of her calves, chopping her legs out from under her.

&#8220;I do whatever it takes to defend the goal,&#8221; Brandi insisted, not showing the slightest bit of remorse.

&#8220;I&#8217;m warning you now for the last time, Brandi,&#8221; said Diana.&nbsp; &#8220;If I see one more flagrant penalty, I&#8217;m benching you; if I don&#8217;t kick you off the team altogether.&nbsp; Plus, I can&#8217;t believe that you would do that to one of your own teammates.&nbsp; We need Heather if we plan to win on Saturday.&#8221;

This was not even a game today.&nbsp; This was just a team practice where the girls had divided into two groups and were scrimmaging.&nbsp; Penalties were especially nonsensical when they were just practicing.&nbsp; They needed to protect one another; not beat each other up.

&#8220;Is that all, Big Tits?&#8221; asked the surly freshman.&nbsp; &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to practice some more.&#8221;

&#8220;No, that&#8217;s not all,&#8221; replied Diana.&nbsp; &#8220;But we&#8217;ll talk about the other things after practice.&#8221;

Diana watched the huge freshman walking away from her and decided that she needed to talk to the coach about this one. She wanted Brandi off the team.&nbsp; Brandi wasn&#8217;t even all that good as a player.&nbsp; She was slow and she was perpetually out of position.&nbsp; The only thing that she had going for her was her size, which Diana admitted did seem to be very intimidating and threatening to most of the opponents that they played so far this year.

Diana walked over to where Heather was sitting on the ground, rubbing the backs of her legs.&nbsp; &#8220;That bitch!&#8221; muttered Heather.&nbsp; &#8220;Did you see what she did to me?&#8221;

&#8220;Yeah, I saw it,&#8221; nodded Diana.&nbsp; &#8220;I already talked to her about it.&#8221;

&#8220;Well, I want her off the team,&#8221; said Heather, a pretty auburn-haired junior at Saxbury.&nbsp; &#8220;She&#8217;s nothing but trouble.&nbsp; And she has a bad attitude.&#8221;

&#8220;You&#8217;re right about the attitude,&#8221; agreed Diana.&nbsp; &#8220;She called me Big Tits.&#8221;

Heather laughed.&nbsp; &#8220;See what I mean?&nbsp; But she&#8217;s right about that one.&nbsp; You do have big tits.&#8221;

&#8220;Heather!&#8221; exclaimed Diana.&nbsp; &#8220;I do not!&#8221;

&#8220;Yes you do,&#8221; countered Heather.&nbsp; &#8220;At least they&#8217;re big on you.&nbsp; And I think they&#8217;re beautiful.&nbsp; All of you is beautiful.&#8221;

Diana blushed at the compliment.&nbsp; She received them frequently but they always embarrassed her.

Diana was indeed beautiful.&nbsp; Her face was absolutely gorgeous with big blue eyes that gave her an air of innocence.&nbsp; The angles and contours of her face made her look aristocratic and elegant, while warm and soft at the same time.&nbsp; Her lips were slightly pouty but in a soft, understated way.&nbsp; And she had a smile that made everyone fall in love with her instantly.

The rest of her body was equally magnificent.&nbsp; Her neck was long and swanlike.&nbsp; She had very finely tapered legs which looked especially long despite her relatively short height.&nbsp; Her ass was tight and compact, like one would expect to see on an athletic girl.&nbsp; Her waist seemed impossibly narrow and, when combined with her nicely flaring feminine hips, gave her the classic hourglass figure.

And then there were her breasts.&nbsp; She tended to disguise them as much as she could because she knew that they looked large on her slender frame.&nbsp; She frequently wore bulky sweaters or a jacket to conceal the soft mounds on her chest.&nbsp; Or she wore a sports bra like she was today in an attempt to squash them down and together to reduce their prominence.&nbsp; But very little that she did actually hid them.&nbsp; They were the first things that most people noticed about her and they were usually the features that most people remembered about her.&nbsp; And if a poll was ever taken, it is likely that at least ninety percent of the people would identify her breasts as her best feature.

&#8220;Are you turning lesbian on me?&#8221; asked Diana warily.

&#8220;Ha!&#8221; snorted Heather.&nbsp; &#8220;Accounting majors like me don&#8217;t have any sexuality at all.&nbsp; We&#8217;re too busy crunching numbers to be straight or les or even bi.&nbsp; We&#8217;re more like eunuchs.&nbsp; But Roman Studies girls get it all.&nbsp; Have you taken the orgy class yet, Di?&#8221;

Diana was one of the Roman Studies majors in the school.&nbsp; Actually, she was double majoring in Roman Studies and Latin and hoped to get a job with a museum after graduation.&nbsp; Eventually, she would like to get a doctorate and return to a college like Saxbury as a professor.

&#8220;Oh yeah,&#8221; kidded Diana.&nbsp; &#8220;I took that last semester.&nbsp; Fucked my way to an A.&#8221;

There was no such class on Roman orgies and Diana was just pulling Heather&#8217;s leg.&nbsp; This was typical of the banter among teammates.

&#8220;I&#8217;d have given you an A plus,&#8221; grinned Heather.

Diana just rolled her eyes and turned and walked off.&nbsp; &#8220;Let&#8217;s get back to the game.&#8221;

Now Diana wasn&#8217;t so sure about Heather&#8217;s sexuality.&nbsp; She had been pretty sure that Heather had been straight until now.&nbsp; To be sure, there were plenty of lesbians among the Saxbury student body but Heather had never seemed to be one.&nbsp; Now, Diana wasn&#8217;t so sure.

Diana started to trot toward the center of the field with Heather right behind her.&nbsp; &#8220;Nice ass, there, captain,&#8221; giggled Heather as Diana&#8217;s skirt flipped up due to a gust of wind.&nbsp; Diana clamped her hand down on her skirt, pressing it to her bottom, but kept running.

&#8220;Okay, girls,&#8221; shouted Diana once she got to the middle of the field.&nbsp; &#8220;Let&#8217;s get back to our drills.&nbsp; I want to see aggressive but clean play.&#8221;&nbsp; She glared at Brandi but the freshman just glared back at her, causing Diana to seethe again.

They played for fifteen minutes and several times the coaches stopped play to provide instruction.&nbsp; Diana and another one from her squad were finally attacking the other goal.&nbsp; The goalie was in position but they should be able to score with two of them on the attack.

Brandi should have been there to help with the defense but, once again, she was out of position.&nbsp; Diana flipped the ball to her teammate who quickly flipped it back to Diana as she was darting around the out-of-position Brandi.

Diana pulled back her stick, ready to fling the ball into the goal to score.&nbsp; Heather watched with horror as she saw Brandi raise her stick over her head and then swing it down quickly, crashing it into Diana&#8217;s head with an awful thud.

Diana crumpled to the ground, unconscious.


Chapter 2

When Diana came to again, she was sitting under a tree, on the grass, with a beautiful wide country landscape all to herself.&nbsp; Well, nearly all to herself.&nbsp; There was a fellow standing over her, looking down at her and looking like he just stepped out of a picture book.

&#8220;You are awake now,&#8221; he said to her.&nbsp; She blinked and shook her head, trying to clear it.&nbsp; He had spoken Latin.&nbsp; Nobody speaks Latin, she thought.

She looked up at him again and realized that she must be dreaming.&nbsp; The outlandish outfit that the male wore looked like a costume that just stepped out of a movie set.&nbsp; The man wore a bronze helmet on his head that flared out to cover the back and sides of his neck.&nbsp; Bright maroon plumes were attached to the top of the helmet.&nbsp; He had armor plating over his shoulders and chest.&nbsp; Beneath the armor, he wore a maroon tunic that extended down to mid-thigh.&nbsp; And his sandals had leather thongs that were laced up and around his calves.

He held a shield in one hand and a sword in the other.&nbsp; Across his back hung a large, wicked looking spear.&nbsp; Whoever was in charge of wardrobe here certainly made things look authentic, she thought.

&#8220;Is this the circus?&#8221; she asked, staying with Latin since she was quite fluent with the language.&nbsp; Two could play at this game, she thought.

The male shook his head and then raised his arm, pointing off in the distance.&nbsp; &#8220;No.&nbsp; Circus is over there.&nbsp; Circus Maximus.&#8221;

Diana followed his gesture with her eyes and saw a city off in the distance.&nbsp; White marbled structures arose from the countryside and seemed to be assembled on a number of small hills.

&#8220;Hartford?&#8221; she asked.&nbsp; She had never been to Hartford but assumed that it would have a lot of marble, what with all of the government buildings and insurance companies.

&#8220;Rome,&#8221; he replied as he lowered his sword again.

Diana blinked again.&nbsp; Either she was dreaming or she had just awakened in a mental institution.&nbsp; But why would she be in a mental institution?&nbsp; She decided that she would have to be very careful around here until she could sort things out.

&#8220;You are my slave,&#8221; he proclaimed.&nbsp; &#8220;Spoils of war.&#8221;

Diana shook her head to clear it again.&nbsp; She opened her mouth to argue with the male but then quickly closed it, thinking better of the idea.&nbsp; If this man was insane, as she assumed, it made no sense for her to provoke him.&nbsp; She would just humor him until she could find the superintendent or warden or whatever they called the person who ran a mental institution.

She stood up and faced the male.&nbsp; &#8220;Where will you take me, my owner?&#8221;

The male smiled.&nbsp; He had been afraid that he would have to use force to subdue her.&nbsp; But maybe not.&nbsp; She was turning out to be a sensible slave, after all.

He pointed toward the marbled city.&nbsp; &#8220;We go to Rome now.&#8221;

Diana turned and started walking with the male following behind her.&nbsp; This was going to be a long walk, Diana realized.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a good thing I&#8217;m wearing sneakers, she thought.

&#8220;How is the Emperor?&#8221; asked Diana as they walked along a path toward the city.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t know why she asked.&nbsp; Whatever came out of the male&#8217;s mouth would be the delusional rantings of a lunatic, she was sure.

&#8220;He is a mad man,&#8221; said the male.&nbsp; Diana found that response odd.&nbsp; It was like the pot calling the kettle black.

&#8220;What is your emperor&#8217;s name?&#8221; she asked.&nbsp; &#8220;I can never remember who is in charge.&#8221;

&#8220;Gaius,&#8221; the male informed her.&nbsp; She wrinkled her nose at the response.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t recognize the name and she should have.&nbsp; She was a Roman Studies major, after all.&nbsp; &#8220;Many call him Caligula,&#8221; he added.

&#8220;Oh my,&#8221; muttered Diana, under her breath.&nbsp; This institution must contain only the most seriously mentally ill if someone thought that he was Caligula.&nbsp; That emperor truly was a mad man.

They passed through a small village of dirt and stone huts.&nbsp; Diana saw that the village hailed the male who was her travelling companion and seemed to be trying to win his favor.&nbsp; But they did not act as if his attire was out of place, which Diana found odd.

Their reaction to her, however, was quite the opposite.&nbsp; The women who were washing clothes in the fountain stopped and gawked at her.&nbsp; Several people disappeared into their huts, only to emerge a moment later, dragging family members with them and pointing at her.

What were they pointing at her for?&nbsp; She was dressed fine, especially for a warm day like this.&nbsp; Her white sports bra was modest enough.&nbsp; She wore a white pleated skirt that was not daring at all.&nbsp; And she had on sneakers and white socks.&nbsp; It was the male who they should have been gawking at.&nbsp; He was the one who looked like he just stepped off the set of the movie &#8220;Gladiator.&#8221;

They continued on through the busy village.&nbsp; Children, as naked as the day they were born, were frolicking in the street, running and jumping over puddles of rainwater.&nbsp; But they too stopped and gawked at her as she walked by.&nbsp; She stopped and stared back at them.&nbsp; They should be the ones who felt out of place, she thought.&nbsp; Why were they running around naked?&nbsp; And why would their parents let them do that in the first place?

She gasped, however, when the male swatted her bottom lightly with the flat of his sword.&nbsp; &#8220;We go to Rome now,&#8221; he said, repeating his earlier announcement.&nbsp; Once again, Diana started walking toward the marble, leaving the little nude gawkers behind.

They arrived in the marbled city about an hour later.&nbsp; Once again, she was surrounded by oddly dressed people, all of whom were staring at her rudely.&nbsp; The attire of choice seemed to be white togas which made Diana wonder if the laundry center of this facility had been ransacked for bed sheets.

Others wore tunics of various colors and designs.&nbsp; Still others were dressed similar to her travelling companion with armor and weapons.&nbsp; There were even several women who were naked, which caused Diana to blush.&nbsp; But they all were dressed as if they were players in a show about ancient Rome.

How could all of these inmates have a shared delusion?&nbsp; How could an entire insane asylum have a common hallucination?&nbsp; It was remarkable to her.

A chariot carrying a male dressed like her companion sped down the street and stopped beside them.&nbsp; &#8220;Hail Claudius,&#8221; the driver said.

&#8220;Hail Ocatvius,&#8221; her &#8216;owner&#8217; replied.

&#8220;Handsome wench you have there,&#8221; said Octavius, causing Diana to seethe with anger.&nbsp; She was not a wench!&nbsp; &#8220;Where did she come from?&nbsp; She is certainly dressed oddly.&#8221;

Claudius nodded.&nbsp; &#8220;Yes, she is oddly dressed.&nbsp; I give you that.&nbsp; I caught her outside the city but I don&#8217;t know where she is from.&nbsp; Probably just from one of the mountain tribes.&nbsp; They always seem to wear the most outlandish things.&#8221;

Octavius nodded in agreement with that statement.&nbsp; &#8220;Golden hair.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a rarity around here.&nbsp; Do you plan to sell her?&nbsp; There&#8217;s an auction tomorrow at the circus, you know.&nbsp; And ones with golden hair always seem to fetch nice prices.&#8221;

&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t thought that far ahead,&#8221; replied Claudius.&nbsp; &#8220;I suppose I should sell her.&nbsp; The Legion moves in a few days to attack Germania.&nbsp; She would be too much trouble to have along on that long march.&#8221;

&#8220;All right,&#8221; Diana finally spoke.&nbsp; This was infuriating.&nbsp; Insanity was no excuse for being rude.&nbsp; She was not going to put up with this any longer.&nbsp; &#8220;I&#8217;ve had it!&nbsp; I demand to see the warden this instant!&#8221;

&#8220;Warden?&#8221; said Claudius.&nbsp; &#8220;What is that?&#8221;

&#8220;Superintendent, then,&#8221; Diana said.&nbsp; &#8220;Take me to the superintendent.&#8221;

&#8220;You speak nonsense, girl,&#8221; laughed Octavius.&nbsp; &#8220;We have no idea what you are talking about.&nbsp; Are you insane?&#8221;

Diana rolled her eyes again, thinking about pots and black kettles.&nbsp; &#8220;What do you call the person who is in charge here?&#8221;

&#8220;Emperor,&#8221; both men replied in unison.

&#8220;Then take me to your emperor,&#8221; demanded Diana.&nbsp; &#8220;Let&#8217;s get this straightened out right now so I can be on my way.&#8221;

Claudius leaned back and raised his hand, stroking his chin as he thought about the girl&#8217;s unusual request.&nbsp; He looked at the strangely dressed girl and then replied.&nbsp; &#8220;Are you sure that you know what you are asking, slave?&nbsp; Nobody ever asks to be taken to Caligula.&nbsp; Nobody ever wants to be anywhere near him.&#8221;

Diana placed her hands on her hips and glared back at the male as defiantly as she could.&nbsp; &#8220;Take me to Caligula.&#8221;

This is ridiculous, she thought.&nbsp; Where were the guards?&nbsp; Where were the nurses?&nbsp; Where were the social workers?&nbsp; And where were the pharmacists?&nbsp; This group was clearly in need of a lot of medication.

&#8220;Caligula returns tomorrow, Claudius,&#8221; offered Octavius.&nbsp; &#8220;You can take her to him then.&nbsp; But I want no part of that sordid task.&#8221;

&#8220;I will take her by myself,&#8221; replied Claudius.&nbsp; &#8220;But it will give me no pleasure to do so.&#8221;

&#8220;What do you call your new slave?&#8221; asked Octavius.

&#8220;I call her slave.&#8221;

&#8220;Has she no name?&#8221; Octavius queried.

&#8220;My name is Diana,&#8221; said Diana, rolling her eyes at the inane blather going on between the two costumed inmates.

&#8220;Diana?&#8221; said Claudius.&nbsp; &#8220;The huntress?&#8221;

Diana nodded.&nbsp; She knew that Diana was a Roman god.&nbsp; Diana was the goddess of the hunt.&nbsp; Her parents had selected that name for her because they thought it was a feminine but strong name for their daughter.&nbsp; &#8220;Yes, the goddess of the hunt,&#8221; she replied.

&#8220;Oh my,&#8221; said Claudius.&nbsp; &#8220;I have enslaved a goddess!&#8221;

Octavius laughed.&nbsp; &#8220;But remember, my friend, Diana is also the goddess of fertility.&#8221;

Diana glanced back Octavius.&nbsp; Then she saw him making a gesture.&nbsp; He connected the tips of his index finger and thumb from one hand together, creating circle.&nbsp; Then he straightened out the index finger from his other hand and moved it in and out of the circle, clearly creating the image of fucking.&nbsp; &#8220;I suggest that we discover just how fertile the goddess Diana is before we deliver her to Caligula.&#8221;

It was Claudius&#8217; turn to laugh.&nbsp; &#8220;Good idea, my friend.&#8221;

Diana was furious at this point.&nbsp; This was going way too far.&nbsp; But furious did not even begin to describe her anger when Claudius reached out and grasped the front of her top and tore it off of her.&nbsp; She sputtered as her breasts spilled free, bobbing on her chest before settling down, and glared at her captor again.

&#8220;Rape!&#8221; she screamed at the top of her lungs.&nbsp; She quickly raised her arms and used them to shield her breasts from the leers of the two men.

&#8220;Not yet, slave,&#8221; said Octavius as he stepped behind her.&nbsp; In another swift move, he tore off her skirt and panties, leaving her naked other than for her sneakers and socks.&nbsp; &#8220;We&#8217;ll save the rape for later.&#8221;

&#8220;Rape!&#8221; she shouted again.&nbsp; She looked around for help as she lowered one of her arms, trying to cover her sex.&nbsp; But nobody was coming to her rescue.&nbsp; A few stopped and smiled at her nudity but most people just went about their business.

Claudius moved a step closer to her and she backed up, bumping into Octavius who was standing behind her.&nbsp; Before she could move to the side to try to escape, however, the chariot driver grasped her arms and pulled them behind her back, quickly tying her wrists together.&nbsp; She struggled to try to free them but they were tied too securely.

&#8220;Rape!&#8221; she shouted again as she lashed her leg back, trying to kick the man who had just bound her.

&#8220;She&#8217;s a spirited one, Claudius,&#8221; he said.&nbsp; &#8220;Are you sure that you don&#8217;t want to keep her?&nbsp; She has a fire within her.&#8221;

&#8220;Yes, she is spirited,&#8221; agreed Claudius.&nbsp; He stepped in front of Diana and reached out, lifting her breasts in his palms.&nbsp; She kicked out and connected with Claudius&#8217; shin, grunting with pain as her foot hit him.&nbsp; He seemed totally unaffected by the blow but her own foot was throbbing with pain.&nbsp; &#8220;And she is very well endowed.&nbsp; She had the size of these very well concealed in that odd garment.&#8221;

Diana bent her head down in an attempt to bite her attacker but Octavius grabbed her ponytail and pulled her head up.&nbsp; &#8220;Behave girl,&#8221; Octavius warned her as he held her in place, using her hair as a handle to control her.

Diana groaned at the helplessness of the situation.&nbsp; She just had to find the head of this insane asylum soon before things spun out of control even more.

&#8220;Let&#8217;s take her to my place,&#8221; said Claudius as he bounced the abundant fleshy orbs in his hands.&nbsp; &#8220;We can enjoy her there.&#8221;

&#8220;Excellent idea, my friend,&#8221; agreed Octavius.&nbsp; &#8220;I&#8217;ll give you a ride.&nbsp; Let me just put a leash on your new girl.&#8221;

Diana&#8217;s eyes opened wide in surprise as Octaviuss went back to the chariot and returned with another piece of rope which he tied snugly around her neck.&nbsp; Then both men got into the chariot and started it down the road.&nbsp; Diana dug her heels in, refusing to follow, but was almost pulled off her feet when the slack in the rope was taken out by the moving chariot.&nbsp; She realized that she could either walk or be dragged behind the chariot and she decided that walking would be less painful.

She was still angry as they led her through the streets with her wrists still tied behind her back.&nbsp; She kept looking left and right as they passed buildings, looking for a nurse&#8217;s station or administrative office or any sign of someone who could stop these insane inmates.&nbsp; But all that she saw were more inmates dressed in togas and&nbsp; tunics, leering at her nudity as the men led her past them.

The chariot came to a halt at one point and she stopped behind it.&nbsp; Claudius pointed off to the right.&nbsp; &#8220;This is the circus that you asked about earlier.&#8221;

Again, Diana&#8217;s eyes opened wide in surprise.&nbsp; It was Circus Maximus!&nbsp; But it was not the Circus Maximus of today which was essentially a city park where the original circus used to be.&nbsp; It was the Circus Maximus of ancient Rome, complete with a track for chariot races and other items that she had read about.

How could this be?&nbsp; It was as if she really was in the Rome of the Roman Empire.&nbsp; But that was impossible, wasn&#8217;t it?&nbsp; She had to figure this out quickly and decided to ask a few questions.&nbsp; If her captors really were ancient Romans, they would know the answers but if they were just lunatics from an insane asylum, they probably wouldn&#8217;t.

&#8220;Who was the emperor before Caligula?&#8221;

&#8220;That was Tiberius,&#8221; replied Octavius.&nbsp; Damn, she thought.&nbsp; That was the correct answer.&nbsp; Most people would never know something like that.

&#8220;What year is this?&#8221; asked Diana.

&#8220;This is the third year of the rule of Caligula,&#8221; said Claudius.

Damn again, she thought.&nbsp; They would not have used terminology like BC or AD at this point in history.&nbsp; They gave the answer that was correct for the period.

Then she gasped.&nbsp; If their answers were to be believed, then she was living in about 40AD.&nbsp; And her family and friends would not be born for almost two thousand years!&nbsp; But how could that possibly be?

She felt the tug on the rope and started walking as the chariot started moving again.&nbsp; She glanced down and saw her breasts bobbing and dancing on her chest with each step.&nbsp; She groaned as her recent discovery seeped into her brain and she started to wrestle with the consequences of it.&nbsp; She was now a Roman slave.&nbsp; But how could this be?

One thing was certain to her now.&nbsp; She definitely did not want to be taken to the emperor at this point.&nbsp; She wracked her brain, trying to remember all of the details of Caligula&#8217;s reign.&nbsp; If she recalled correctly, it was a short reign of maybe four or five years.&nbsp; But he established quite a reputation for himself during those few short years.

Caligula must have been mentally unbalanced if all of the stories about him were true.&nbsp; He had a reputation for cruelty and instilling terror in his subjects.&nbsp; And the stories of his decadence and perversions went on and on.&nbsp; It seemed that no sexual act was taboo as far as he was concerned.

&#8220;Wait!&#8221; she shouted to the two men in the chariot.&nbsp; &#8220;I changed my mind.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want you to take me to the Emperor.&#8221;

&#8220;Now you&#8217;re talking sense, girl,&#8221; replied Claudius.

&#8220;That&#8217;s a smart slave you have there,&#8221; added Octavius.&nbsp; But the chariot kept moving, leading Diana down the street.

&#8220;Wait!&#8221; shouted Diana again.&nbsp; &#8220;I said I don&#8217;t want to go to Caligula.&nbsp; Why aren&#8217;t you stopping?&nbsp; Why are we still moving?&#8221;

&#8220;We heard you, girl,&#8221; said Claudius, looking over his shoulder to see the beautiful captive and the delightful way that her breasts were animated by her steps.

&#8220;Then why aren&#8217;t you stopping?&#8221; she asked, blushing from the way that his eyes were ogling her chest.

&#8220;We weren&#8217;t planning on taking you to him today anyways,&#8221; he replied.&nbsp; &#8220;We&#8217;re taking you home now.&#8221;

Octavius turned and looked back at the girl, leering at her nudity.&nbsp; &#8220;We are going to test a goddess&#8217; fertility today.&#8221;

Diana groaned.&nbsp; They planned to rape her after all.&nbsp; It was just so unfair.&nbsp; And now she knew that not only was she a slave, but she was destined to be a sex slave.

Shortly after that, Octavius stopped the chariot and tethered the horses to a post.&nbsp; Claudius tugged on the leash and propelled Diana forward toward the doorway of the stone house as Octavius gave her naked ass a swat.

Oh god, thought Diana.&nbsp; Here it comes!&nbsp; It was not as if Diana was a virgin.&nbsp; She was far from promiscuous but she had enjoyed sex with several boys during her college career.&nbsp; But this was going to be so different.&nbsp; She never had sex with two men before.&nbsp; And even when she did have sex with one male, it had been a male of her choosing.&nbsp; Now she was about to be used and abused by two complete strangers.

The leash was removed from her neck and then her wrists were unbound.&nbsp; She glanced around and considered running to try to escape.&nbsp; But where would a naked girl in a strange land and a strange time go?&nbsp; She decided that she would stay for a little longer.&nbsp; Maybe they would feed her and maybe she could find some clothes before she escaped.

They had her remove her shoes and commented on her odd sandals.&nbsp; Then the two men sat on a bench and looked at her.&nbsp; &#8220;Dance for us, girl.&#8221;

Diana blinked.&nbsp; Dance?&nbsp; Well at least it was better than being raped.&nbsp; But how did slaves dance in ancient Rome?&nbsp; She had no idea.&nbsp; So she just started moving and gyrating her body, extending her arms as she undulated.

&#8220;It is a strange dance,&#8221; commented Octavius.&nbsp; &#8220;But pleasing.&#8221;

&#8220;Yes, very pleasing,&#8221; agreed Claudius.&nbsp; &#8220;It must be a tribal dance of some sort.&nbsp; What tribe are you, girl?&#8221; he asked her.

She thought for a moment, not sure how to reply.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t know the names of any of the tribes from this era.&nbsp; And even if she did, it would be dangerous to name one.&nbsp; She had no idea which ones were friends or foes of the Romans.

&#8220;The Saxbury tribe,&#8221; she finally replied.

&#8220;Hmmm,&#8221; nodded Claudius.&nbsp; &#8220;That&#8217;s a new one on me.&nbsp; Is it a Celtic tribe?&#8221;

&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Diana.&nbsp; &#8220;It is from the north.&#8221;&nbsp; She turned and twisted.&nbsp; She held her arms out to her sides and twirled again, trying to be as graceful as possible without being suggestive.&nbsp; She did not want to encourage the two males into thinking that she was sexually available, even though she knew that they would probably make her available by force if they had to.

But males will be males.&nbsp; After she had danced for about fifteen minutes, Claudius leaned back and flipped up the skirt of his tunic, revealing his manhood.&nbsp; &#8220;Come, girl.&nbsp; Dance on this.&#8221;

Diana gasped as she saw the cock standing tall and proud.&nbsp; It was not the largest cock that she had ever seen but it&#8217;s girth was very impressive.&nbsp; And it appeared to already be as hard as a rock.

&#8220;Does my dancing displease you?&#8221; she asked as she continued to sway and step.&nbsp; Maybe she could postpone her rape.

&#8220;Your dancing pleases me very much, girl,&#8221; he replied as he lightly stroked his shaft.&nbsp; &#8220;Can&#8217;t you see what you have done to me?&nbsp; Now come take care of your master.&#8221;

She pondered what to do in this situation.&nbsp; How could she avoid what seemed to be inevitable?&nbsp; Or at least how could she postpone it?&nbsp; She glanced back to Claudius who had crooked a finger and was beckoning her.&nbsp; She continued to ponder.&nbsp; But then her pondering was cut short as Octavius arose from the bench and unhooked a whip from his belt as he leered at her.&nbsp; He swung it through the air and snapped it menacingly for effect.

&#8220;Yikes!&#8221; she peeped as she saw the threatening leer.&nbsp; She quickly scampered to Claudius and straddled his legs.&nbsp; He gripped her waist and starting pressing her downward.&nbsp; She felt herself blushing and wondered what they used for lubricant in ancient days.

But she needn&#8217;t have worried about that.&nbsp; She felt the bulb of his cock touch her petals and then felt the shaft slicing into her body easily.&nbsp; Was she already that wet?&nbsp; Why was she wet?&nbsp; Was she aroused by this?&nbsp; Surely not!

She felt every inch of the thick cock&#8217;s travel as it stretched her and filled her.&nbsp; She moaned once it was fully embedded in her sex and then moaned again as Claudius&#8217; grip on her waist started moving her back upward, letting the monster start to recede from her body.

She closed her eyes and silently scolded herself for her behavior and the predicament that her failures had gotten her into.&nbsp; She had not followed the rules and now she was suffering the consequences with an unwanted male fucking her against her will.&nbsp; She had taken the rape prevention classes.&nbsp; Hell, she had even taught the class last month to a group of freshmen lacrosse players.&nbsp; So why hadn&#8217;t she done what she was supposed to do?&nbsp; How could she ignore all of that training today, of all days?

The very first thing that she was supposed to do was attack and scream and make a commotion that might either scare her assailant away or attract help.&nbsp; Instead, she had just casually carried on a conversation with Claudius and then walked with him back to Rome.&nbsp; Although, at the time, she rationalized, she had no idea that she would be raped.&nbsp; She thought that she was in a mental institution and that all she had to do was find the people in charge.

And she did scream &#8216;rape&#8217; as soon as they stripped her clothes off of her.&nbsp; So she supposed that she did that part right.

After that, they had her bound and there was nothing to do to protect herself.&nbsp; The class taught that self-preservation was best at that point.&nbsp; Do whatever you have to do to not be injured or killed.&nbsp; So she had let the male sink his beefy cock into her unwilling body and now she was being moved up and down on his pole.

All in all, she supposed, she had actually followed most of the advice.&nbsp; And the only reason that she hadn&#8217;t followed all of it was because there was confusion at the beginning.&nbsp; She hadn&#8217;t realized that she had somehow been magically transported back two thousand years.

Hands lifted her breasts and squeezed them.&nbsp; &#8220;Are you hungry, Diana?&#8221; asked Octavius.&nbsp; He was standing behind her now and was holding her breasts, toying with them.

She realized that she was indeed hungry.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t remember the last time she ate.&nbsp; Actually, she could remember but that meal was two thousand years in the future.&nbsp; &#8220;Yes, I am hungry.&#8221;

Octavius released her breasts and then gripped her ponytail, using it as a handle again to turn her head to the side.&nbsp; He reached down with his other hand and lifted the hem of his tunic, allowing his cock to spring into view.&nbsp; &#8220;Allow me to feed you, then.&#8221;

Diana gasped as she realized what she was about to be forced to do.&nbsp; She had done it before so that was not a problem.&nbsp; But it had never been one of her favorite activities.&nbsp; At least part of the gasp, however, had been caused by the cock itself.&nbsp; Whereas Claudius&#8217; cock was squat and thick, the one that sprang from Octavius&#8217; crotch was extremely long and narrow.&nbsp; And it curved upward.&nbsp; One of the males had a club dangling between his legs while the other one had a long curved spear!

Octavius continued to use the ponytail as a handle and pulled her face toward his cock.&nbsp; It bumped against her lips but she kept them sealed tightly together.

Her nipples erupted in pain and she glanced down, seeing Claudius&#8217; fingers flattening her sensitive little nubbins, crushing them in his grip.&nbsp; &#8220;Open your mouth, girl.&nbsp; Be a good little slave for us.&#8221;

Diana whimpered at the helplessness of her situation.&nbsp; She wanted to resist but she could not take the shooting pain in her breasts any longer.&nbsp; Reluctantly, she parted her lips and the other male slid his long, slender cock into her waiting mouth.&nbsp; Immediately, the pressure on her nipples was released but her tender little buds continued to throb.

She continued to be pumped up and down on the cock embedded in her pussy as Claudius moved her at the pace he liked.&nbsp; Octavius also started a pumping action in her mouth, pushing deep at times and causing her to gag.&nbsp; Again, she felt herself blushing as the two men used her body so completely.

This went on for what seemed like forever.&nbsp; Why didn&#8217;t they cum and be done with it?&nbsp; Finally, Diana decided to take things into her own hands, or at least her pussy and mouth.&nbsp; She decided to help them so that she could get this ordeal behind her.&nbsp; She clamped her pussy around the thick stalk embedded in her sex, hoping that would push the one male over the edge.&nbsp; And she sucked on the other one, bathing it with her tongue and fluttering her tongue along its length in hopes of stimulating it to orgasm.

They continued like this for a while longer but then Octavius suddenly pulled out.&nbsp; She expected to be showered with his hot, sticky sperm but was surprised when he stepped back and then maneuvered himself behind her.

&#8220;Hold her steady, my friend,&#8221; she heard Octavius say.&nbsp; Then Claudius pushed her down on the massive rod in her sex and held her there.

She felt fingers prying her bottom cheeks apart and then felt something cold and wet rubbing against her little pucker.

&#8220;No!!!!&#8221; she wailed.&nbsp; &#8220;Not that!!!&#8221;

She had never been taken anally and never had any desire to try it.&nbsp; She continued to protest and resist.&nbsp; But with Claudius&#8217; tight grip on her waist and Octavius holding her tightly by her arms, she was no match for the big men.&nbsp; She grunted as she felt the long cock pushing at her tight little sphincter and then howled as it pushed its way into her.

&#8220;No!!!!&#8221; she continued to wail, but the long monster continued to enter her.&nbsp; She felt every inch of its travel as it forced its way into her bowels and continued to howl and wail.&nbsp; Finally, she felt it stop moving and she realized that it was fully embedded in her.

Claudius started her moving on his cock again and Octavius started pumping in and out of her ass.&nbsp; It was so awful!&nbsp; She could feel them slicing in and out of her body and occasionally felt them banging into one another inside of her.

Octavius reached around her and claimed her breasts again, lifting them and squeezing them as he continued to piston his rod in and out of her ass.&nbsp; Claudius released her waist and let his fingers dance over her silky, captive flesh.&nbsp; Eventually, he found her clit and started stroking it, sending unwanted thrills through her body.

The stimulus was becoming too much for her.&nbsp; As much as she tried to resist it, she felt an orgasm approaching, building momentum inside of her body.&nbsp; She bit her lower lip anxiously, trying to fend off the climax.

But the cocks deep in her body and the magical work of the fingers proved to be too much for her.&nbsp; Her body tensed and she let out a low, rolling growl as her body erupted in orgasm.&nbsp; The last thing that she remembered before passing out was feeling the two cocks twitching as they shot their loads of sperm into her pussy and ass.


To be continued









Chapter 3

She awoke the next morning on a mat with her wrists bound behind her again.&nbsp; A rope around her neck was tied to the leg of a table, apparently to prevent her from wandering or trying to escape.&nbsp; As she lay on her side, she saw one naked male in front of her and could feel the other male behind her.&nbsp; Both were still asleep.

She raised her head and looked around, trying to figure out her options.&nbsp; The door did not appear to have a lock so she should be able to escape through it.&nbsp; But first she needed to get rid of her bindings and find some clothing.

She glanced at the rope that had led from her neck to the table leg.&nbsp; It appeared to be long enough to allow her to reach most of the room.&nbsp; She continued to peer about and saw two piles of weapons where the men had dropped their clothes the night before.&nbsp; Lying on top of one of the piles was a knife or dagger of some sort.&nbsp; That would let her cut away her bindings.&nbsp; And she supposed that she could steal one of their tunics although it would probably look like a full length and baggy dress on her.

She looked at the male in front of her.&nbsp; Claudius was still sleeping.&nbsp; She slowly sat up, being careful not to disturb the men, as she prepared to start her escape.&nbsp; She started to get to her knees and then felt a hand grab her ponytail.&nbsp; She groaned as Octavius dragged her back down and then guided her face to his crotch.&nbsp; Once again, the long slender cock was fed into her mouth, this time pushing clear into her throat and causing her to gag.

These men were insatiable!&nbsp; She lost track of how many times and how many ways they had fucked her the night before.&nbsp; She was amazed that they could even get erect at this point.&nbsp; But apparently, they could because Octavius was rock hard and he was bobbing her head up and down on the long shaft.

Claudius was not about to be left out.&nbsp; He was awakened by the motions nearby and gripped Diana&#8217;s hips, pulling her up to her knees.&nbsp; He knelt behind her and then slowly pushed his beefy cock into her sex, causing her to moan as she was stretched and filled.

The entire morning became another orgy of three as the two warriors satiated their lust on her captive body.&nbsp; Again, all of her holes were used at one point or another.&nbsp; Even her breasts were fucked which was another first for her.&nbsp; Octavius had pushed her onto her back and straddled her, pushing her soft, fleshy mounds together to encase his cock as he pumped his shaft between her breasts.&nbsp; She ended up with sperm all over her face and neck when he finally erupted.

&#8220;It&#8217;s a shame not to keep her, my friend,&#8221; said Octavius as he drove the chariot with Claudius riding as a passenger.&nbsp; Once again, a very naked Diana was being tugged along behind the thing with a rope tied around her neck.&nbsp; She was exhausted from all of the sex and all of the orgasms she had received in the past twenty four hours.&nbsp; But she was also terrified.&nbsp; If she was right, she was being taken somewhere to be sold and that idea frightened her out of her wits.

She had to come up with a plan, though.&nbsp; She certainly did not want to be sold in slavery.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not what Saxbury girls did, after all.&nbsp; But she could tell that was going to happen regardless of her desires or wants or needs.&nbsp; She needed to come up with a way to get out of this mess.&nbsp; But the events of the past twenty four hours had her mind in turmoil and she could not think clearly.&nbsp; And it didn&#8217;t help her ability to think that she was petrified by what lay ahead of her.

She needed to wait until things settled down a bit, she decided.&nbsp; But when would that happen?&nbsp; Every time that she opened her eyes, there was another surprise waiting for her.&nbsp; A new indignity always seemed poised and ready to swoop down on her.

So far, she had managed to deal with each indignity and humiliation.&nbsp; She had not wanted the sex but it did not kill her.&nbsp; She would prefer to be wearing clothes but her nudity had not damaged her.&nbsp; Maybe if she could get through the day and into a stable household, she would have time to sort things out.&nbsp; She could catch her breath and then make a plan.&nbsp; And then she could escape.

But where would she escape to?&nbsp; She would be an escaped slave on the run.&nbsp; She might make it out of Rome but then where would that lead her?&nbsp; Into the clutches of the Gauls or the Visigoths?&nbsp; That didn&#8217;t sound attractive at all.

If this really was ancient Rome, then she was probably better off staying in Rome.&nbsp; But being a slave was unthinkable to her.&nbsp; She would have to find a way to elevate her station.&nbsp; But there was no way that was going to happen today; not when she was naked and being dragged behind a chariot on her way to being sold at an auction.

Her mind was pulled back to the present as her shin collided with the chariot.&nbsp; It had stopped but she hadn&#8217;t noticed.&nbsp; She had been too deep in thought.

&#8220;Pay attention, girl,&#8221; scolded Claudius.&nbsp; &#8220;I don&#8217;t want my merchandise being damaged, especially on auction day.&#8221;

She gasped again as she was reminded that she was about to be sold.&nbsp; She looked around and saw that she had been brought back to Circus Maximus.&nbsp; This time, it was filled with throngs of people and there was an almost carnival atmosphere to the place.

The two men got out of the chariot and led her through the crowd.&nbsp; She blushed furiously as men and women eyed her nudity and she heard them commenting about her or asking Claudius questions.

&#8220;That&#8217;s a delectable morsel,&#8221; said one man.

&#8220;I just love the way her adorable breasts bounce along,&#8220; a woman commented.

&#8220;Tight ass,&#8221; another man said.&nbsp; &#8220;Perfect for fucking.&#8221;

To this comment, Octavius replied.&nbsp; &#8220;Her ass is divine.&nbsp; I can attest to that.&#8221;&nbsp; Diana felt her blush deepen at that comment.

&#8220;Where did you catch her, Sir?&#8221; asked a dark-skinned male who she assumed to be a merchant from another land.

In response, Claudius went into a long tale about how he had been in the northern mountains when he was attacked by a tribe of Celts.&nbsp; There were at least ten of the savages but he told about how he proved to be mightier than them.&nbsp; He had slain each of their warriors with his sword and his spear.&nbsp; Then he had taken five of their women, all of whom were exceptionally beautiful.&nbsp; He had already sold the rest of them and was here today to sell the last one before he left with the Legion on their next campaign.

The little crowd that surrounded them oooed and aahhhed as they listened to Claudius&#8217; fanciful tale.&nbsp; Diana just rolled her eyes.&nbsp; There had been no tribe of savage Celts.&nbsp; The truth was that he found her sleeping beneath a tree and had kidnapped her and raped her.

She was led deeper into the crowd until they reached the auction area.&nbsp; At that point, she was placed on a short pedestal with a pole sticking up from the center of it.&nbsp; Her wrists were untied and then retied behind her back and around the pole.&nbsp; Now she was on display for all of the potential buyers to inspect.

&#8220;Look eager to please,&#8221; instructed Claudius as he positioned her the way that he wanted.&nbsp; He was acting like a grocer polishing his apples so that people would buy them.

&#8220;Be sure to look sexual,&#8221; said Octavius.&nbsp; He had a finger stroking in and out of her sex as he tweaked and rolled her nipples, causing them to stiffen.

Diana was miserable.&nbsp; This was easily the worst experience of her life.&nbsp; It was totally humiliating to be treated as an object or like livestock.&nbsp; How could people be so cruel?&nbsp; Why did slavery even exist?

A steady flow of people approached her as the day wore on.&nbsp; Some were content to just look her over.&nbsp; Many, however, needed a more tactile inspection.&nbsp; She was poked and prodded and probed.&nbsp; Her flesh was pinched and patted.&nbsp; Her hair was tugged and her nipples were tweaked.&nbsp; And then there were the ones who wanted to test her responsiveness and who fingered her sex or ass or flicked her clit.&nbsp; She lost track of the number of orgasms that were inflicted on her vulnerable body.

Throughout all of this, Claudius and Octavius stood nearby.&nbsp; Claudius retold his story of her capture over and over again and each time he became more heroic in the tale.&nbsp; The size of the tribe grew to twenty and then twenty five and then thirty and then forty.&nbsp; At one point, her tribe gained horses and Claudius had to combat the mounted Celts.&nbsp; Eventually, a dragon entered the story and Claudius had to slay it as he returned home with his twenty captive female slaves.

Octavius regaled the potential buyers with stories of how sexual she was.&nbsp; It started with his actual experiences with her which caused her to blush to no end.&nbsp; She had to relive the experience of the anal rape and then the other things he had done to her.

But then he too started exaggerating the facts.&nbsp; He talked about how she could climax with just the hint of a breeze across her wanton body.&nbsp; He told of how she could make a man climax with just the fluttering of her eyelashes over the tip of a cock.&nbsp; If women were in the audience, he told of how she could please a woman and cause her to climax simply by brushing her hair across a woman&#8217;s naked flesh.&nbsp; She sounded like a complete slut, even to herself.

It was dehumanizing.&nbsp; It was completely demoralizing.&nbsp; And yet, there was nothing that she could do about it.&nbsp; She was merely property and the two men were merely trying to maximize what they could get for her.&nbsp; 

It was also going to be painful for her, she could tell.&nbsp; She had been standing naked in the hot Mediterranean sun for hours.&nbsp; Parts of her that had never been exposed to sunlight were now being baked in the heat.&nbsp; She was sure that she would end up looking like a lobster by the end of the day.

&#8220;Ahhh, Celtic woman,&#8221; sighed one of the women who had been listening to Octavius.&nbsp; &#8220;I hear that they are the most erotic creatures on earth.

&#8220;She will be a fine one to breed with my boys,&#8221; another male said a little later.&nbsp; &#8220;She looks wiry and fast.&nbsp; And maybe I&#8217;ll get some more yellow-haired ones from her offspring.&#8221;

&#8220;She has beautiful breasts,&#8221; a woman observed as she plumped Diana&#8217;s fleshy mounds in her hands.&nbsp; &#8220;Is she producing milk?&#8221;

&#8220;Better than milk,&#8221; replied Octavius who seemed to have the assignment of extolling all of her sexual charms.&nbsp; &#8220;Pure honey flows from her breasts.&nbsp; And from her cunt flows the sweetness that is the nectar of the gods.&#8221;

&#8220;Oh brother,&#8221; muttered Diana under her breath.&nbsp; These people can&#8217;t really believe all of this nonsense, can they?

Finally, viewing time was over.&nbsp; At least it was over for her.&nbsp; She noticed that many naked women were still bound on pedestals as she was released from hers.&nbsp; As she was led away, she even noticed some naked men bound on pedestals, each of which was sporting an erection.&nbsp; She supposed that the males were just as humiliated as she was.

She was led onto a sort of stage.&nbsp; Actually, it was more like a stone platform with columns along the back.&nbsp; She was placed in the center of the stage, facing a sea of eager faces.&nbsp; These are the people who want to own me, she realized.

The auctioneer had Claudius describe her capture.&nbsp; This time, the Celts were also protected by a pride of lions.&nbsp; Then Octavius was given the opportunity to extol her sexual virtues and, in this telling of the story, she could turn an impotent man into a virile sex addict simply by smiling at him.&nbsp; It was all just too much!

The auctioneer finally took over.&nbsp; For the next five minutes, he conducted an appraisal of her which he verbally shared with the audience, providing a running commentary on each aspect of her body.&nbsp; Once again, her breasts were bounced as the man described their texture and firmness.&nbsp; He pried open her mouth and tilted her head forward, showing the crowd that she had a full set of teeth, although she doubted that very many of the people could actually see that from the distance they were.

His hands travelled down her sides and he spent quite a bit of time at her waist to make sure that the offers for her purchase reflected her fine, sleek figure.&nbsp; He turned her back to the audience and bent her at the waist.&nbsp; This brought fresh blushes to her face as she realized how lewdly displayed she was.&nbsp; Eventually, the male gripped her bottom cheeks and spread them.

&#8220;Have you ever seen a finer ass?&#8221; he asked the audience rhetorically.&nbsp; Her face erupted into new shades of crimson.

She felt him touching her little pucker, causing goose bumps to erupt all over her body.&nbsp; &#8220;And you have already heard Octavius tell of the delights that can be encountered beyond this tight door.&#8221;

Oh god, she thought.&nbsp; This can&#8217;t be happening to me!

Finally, he straightened her up again and turned her to face the audience once again.&nbsp; Again, his hand travelled down her tight belly.&nbsp; This time, it stopped at the little tuft of hair on her mound.

&#8220;As you can see,&#8221; he said loudly so that all could hear him.&nbsp; &#8220;She is truly a honey-haired beauty.&nbsp; See the fairness of her nether patch.&nbsp; And notice how it only grows in a narrow little strip of fur.&#8221;

The truth was that she trimmed it.&nbsp; She did not like the look of the wild patch that naturally grew there.&nbsp; So she always trimmed it into a narrow little vertical strip.&nbsp; She thought that looked more elegant.

At last, he pushed a finger abruptly into her sex, causing her to gasp at the sudden intrusion and to rise up onto her toes to try to escape the assault.&nbsp; Several of the buyers laughed at her reaction, bringing fresh color to her cheeks.

Then she groaned as the man withdrew his finger and held it up for all to see.&nbsp; It was shiny with her juices.&nbsp; How could that be?

&#8220;For those who cannot see, let me describe what I am showing you,&#8221; he said.&nbsp; &#8220;My finger has just been coated with what looks like the nectar of the gods.&nbsp; The girl is flowing copiously, obviously ready to be used in any way that you desire.&#8221;

He held the finger to his lips and then swiped his tongue along it, obviously tasting her.&nbsp; It was just shameful in her mind.&nbsp; &#8220;And her taste is out of this world.&nbsp; Even Venus could not taste more heavenly than this little creature.&nbsp; Now, what am I offered for this little bundle of pleasure?

It was total mayhem after that.&nbsp; Arms were waving.&nbsp; People were shouting.&nbsp; Not a person seemed to be silent.&nbsp; They all wanted to buy her.

She felt numb with fear at the spectacle before her.&nbsp; It was unbelievable, really.&nbsp; She never could have imagined a scene like this.

She was scared out of her wits.&nbsp; But at the same time, she felt a tiny shred of pride that so many people wanted her, even if they wanted her to own her.&nbsp; It was unbelievable, really.

The bidding continued for a long time.&nbsp; People jostled for position so that their bids could be seen or heard.&nbsp; Several fist fights broke out as people maneuvered to gain advantage over competing bidders.&nbsp; It was unbelievable, really.

In the midst of all of this, another male stepped onto the platform and went to the auctioneer.&nbsp; He whispered something into the auctioneer&#8217;s ear and she could tell that a heated debate ensued.&nbsp; Finally, the auctioneer turned back to the audience and held up his hands to silence the crowd.

&#8220;The honey-haired girl has been sold,&#8221; he announced after the throngs calmed down.

Diana&#8217;s heart sank at the news.&nbsp; Even though she knew exactly what was going on and that they were in the process of selling her, it still caught her by surprise.&nbsp; It was absolutely devastating to hear that you were sold.&nbsp; She closed her eyes and hung her head in defeat.

The crowd did not like the news either but they were more vocal about it.&nbsp; They exploded with shouts and complaints.&nbsp; A few even hurled fruits and vegetables at the auctioneer.&nbsp; The auctioneer stood his ground and held up his hands again, urging the crowd to calm down.&nbsp; Once they were quiet, he spoke again.

&#8220;The honey-haired girl has been acquired,&#8221; he told them again.&nbsp; &#8220;That is all that I can say about it.&#8221;

There was a collective gasp from the audience, catching Diana by surprise.&nbsp; She opened her eyes and looked up at the group that had been frantically bidding on her body only moments before.&nbsp; Now they stood in silence, many with their mouths agape.

What was wrong with them?&nbsp; They looked shocked and maybe even frightened.&nbsp; She saw some of them whispering to one another and nodding in agreement.&nbsp; It was all very confusing to her.

A male came onto the platform and tied a rope around her neck.&nbsp; He was dressed similar to Claudius and Octavius but his outfit was more colorful and his armor was more ornate.&nbsp; The new male led her off of the platform and through the crowd which parted to make way for them.

&#8220;Caligula bought her,&#8221; she heard a man whisper to someone else.&nbsp; &#8220;That is a Praetorian Guard leading her away.&#8221;

Again, her heart sank at the news.&nbsp; This time, her blood ran cold also.


Chapter 4

Diana&#8217;s first introduction to the deranged emperor had been on his barge.&nbsp; He had apparently selected her to be purchased when he saw her at Circus Maximus.&nbsp; But then he left the actual transaction to be handled by one of his minions while he left to go to his barge.&nbsp; He would be leaving for Capri the next morning.

Diana had been in a daze after the auction.&nbsp; She was led to a booth where money changed hands.&nbsp; She stared at the small pile of coins wistfully, realizing that they represented her entire value in the world.

After that, she was taken to one of the palaces where the royal physician met them.&nbsp; He seemed to be nothing more than a dirty old man as far as Diana was concerned.&nbsp; He probed her pussy and ass for reasons that were not apparent to the new slave.&nbsp; He bounced her breasts in his palms and then stretched her nipples away from her chest painfully.&nbsp; Again, it was not clear what he was checking.&nbsp; Finally, after having her give him a blowjob, he declared her healthy and suitable to be the emperor&#8217;s property.

Diana was still in a daze as she was led out of the palace.&nbsp; She was fuming over being declared to be property, but she was still in a daze.&nbsp; Everything about this whole place and this whole situation seemed so surrealistic to her.

She was taken to the waterfront.&nbsp; At least, she was allowed to ride now, which was quite an improvement from all of the walking she had been doing lately.&nbsp; On the banks of the river was a blacksmith shop.&nbsp; Or maybe he was an armorer.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t tell.&nbsp; All that she knew was that it was a place where they did metalworking.&nbsp; This is where she received her new jewelry.

The metal worker toiled for over two hours, heating the metal, forming it, cooling it, and testing the fit.&nbsp; Time after time, the metal was heated again to repeat the process as Diana stood naked in the shop.&nbsp; The two guards who brought her here rested and watched the process, enjoying the new slave&#8217;s nudity.

It was all so unbelievable to Diana.&nbsp; She was still adjusting to the knowledge that she had been enslaved and sold.&nbsp; It would still take some time to get over that abrupt change in her life.&nbsp; But now she was being fitted for shackles.&nbsp; If she didn&#8217;t realize that she was a slave before this, these pieces of metal circling parts of her body would be sure to remind her of that fact.

Finally, the tradesman seemed to be satisfied with the fit.&nbsp; A piece of metal was wrapped around each wrist and then locked in place.&nbsp; Another was fitted around her slender neck and she shuddered as she heard it click shut, locking it also.

For shackles, they were not bad looking, she had to admit.&nbsp; It looked like they were made of pure gold and were delicately engraved with intricate floral designs.&nbsp; She could envision wearing one of the cuffs as a bracelet, although she could not imagine wearing her new collar to a party with friends.

&#8220;I will accept a favor from her as my payment,&#8221; the tradesman said to the two guards as he raised her arms and attached her cuffs to rings on her collar.&nbsp; She gasped, both from the male&#8217;s suggestion and also from the fact that she had just lost the use of her arms.&nbsp; Now her wrists were at her neck with her elbows pointing forward, leaving her completely helpless and vulnerable.

&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid not, Titus,&#8221; answered one of the guards.&nbsp; &#8220;This one is personal property of Caesar.&nbsp; Even we are prohibited from enjoying her body.&nbsp; It&#8217;s such a shame.&nbsp; She looks like she would be much fun.&#8221;

&#8220;Ah,&#8221; nodded Titus.&nbsp; &#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s a shame.&nbsp; But at least our emperor has good taste in female flesh.&#8221;&nbsp; He reached out and stroked the side of Diana&#8217;s left breast, sending goose bumps down her side.

It was dusk when she was finally led onto the barge and the sight that met her eyes caused her to blush deeply.&nbsp; The boat was like a writhing sea of naked flesh and there must have been forty or fifty people engaged in one form of sexual activity or other.

A man was lying on his back with a girl bobbing up and down on his cock as he sucked on the breast of another woman who was leaning over his face.&nbsp; The second woman was being fucked from behind by a man who was, in turn, being fucked in the ass by another man behind him.

A woman was bound spread eagle into a circular frame that was being spun like a roulette wheel as a man and woman lashed at her exposed body with short whips.&nbsp; They too were fucking as they whipped the spinning girl.

Another woman was bound spread eagle in what looked like a spider web of rope.&nbsp; A naked girl was licking her pussy and a man was fucking her from behind as another man placed cruel looking clamps on her breasts.

It looked like total, decadent chaos to her.&nbsp; The guards led her through the sea of bodies and hands reached up, stroking her or squeezing her flesh.&nbsp; With her wrists attached to her collar, she was totally defenseless to the pawing and groping.

Two men were in her way as they sucked on one another&#8217;s cocks and she had to step over them as the guards continued to urge her along.&nbsp; A woman was moaning nearby as a dog pounded its cock into her.&nbsp; It seemed like there were no taboos at all on this boat and this seemed to be what she envisioned Hell to be like.

She looked up from all of the perversions around her and gasped at what she saw.&nbsp; On a slightly elevated platform sat a throne.&nbsp; Beside the throne knelt two naked and very busty girls.&nbsp; And in the throne was a figure who could only be Caligula.

You could not tell from his clothing that he was the emperor, for he was naked.&nbsp; But he had gilded olive branches wrapped around his head that she was sure was a crown of some sort.

She felt her heart jump into her throat and felt her pulse starting to race as she glanced down at his lap.&nbsp; His cock was hard, which was to be expected with all of the erotic sights surrounding him.&nbsp; But it was massive!&nbsp; It had all of the length of Octavius and all of the girth of Claudius.&nbsp; It was a monster!

The man on the throne was watching her and letting his eyes travel up and down her body.&nbsp; She trembled as she saw his eyes roaming over her nudity and all sorts of questions raced through her mind.&nbsp; Did he find her pretty?&nbsp; What would it mean if he did?&nbsp; What would it mean if he didn&#8217;t?

Based on what she remembered from her classes, Caligula could be depraved and he could be extremely cruel but there was very little chance that he could be kind.&nbsp; She would have preferred that he treated her kindly, but that was unlikely to happen.&nbsp; She supposed that his being depraved with her was something she could live with even if she didn&#8217;t like it.&nbsp; She only hoped that he was not cruel to her.

She remembered a story of a time that Caligula was bored as he watched some gladiators fighting wild beasts in an arena.&nbsp; For entertainment, he had an entire section of the viewing stands emptied.&nbsp; Then he threw the people who had been sitting in that section into the arena and watched with amusement as the beasts slaughtered them and ate them.

Another story told of how a female guest at dinner displeased him one time.&nbsp; He had her bound against a pole in the dining room and then he had her carved up, little by little, as her body parts were then cooked and served to his guests.&nbsp; Her breasts were the first things to be sliced off, followed by her ears and her pussy.&nbsp; Then she was disemboweled and various organs were harvested and cooked and consumed.&nbsp; Fortunately, the woman died before the meal got too far along but the butchering continued until all of the woman&#8217;s flesh and organs had been cooked and eaten.

Diana shuddered.&nbsp; Yes, she definitely did not wanted to be treated cruelly by this man.&nbsp; She vowed to be an obedient and pleasing slave.

&#8220;Your honey-haired girl, Caesar,&#8221; one of the guards said as he pushed Diana in front of the seated man.&nbsp; Caligula&#8217;s face remained expressionless but he raised his eyes to meet hers.

&#8220;Greetings, girl,&#8221; he said.

&#8220;Greetings, Caesar,&#8221; she replied with a trembling voice.&nbsp; &#8220;Or your majesty.&nbsp; Or master.&nbsp; What am I supposed to call you?&#8221;

&#8220;Master will be fine,&#8221; he responded.&nbsp; &#8220;It will make you different from the rest of them.&#8221;&nbsp; He indicated who &#8216;them&#8217; was with the sweep of his arm, gesturing to the rutting and moaning masses surrounding him on the boat.

&#8220;Greetings, Master,&#8221; she nodded and then shuddered again.&nbsp; Was it good to be different?&nbsp; She had no idea.

&#8220;Come closer, little one,&#8221; he instructed.&nbsp; &#8220;Let me see what I bought.&#8221;

&#8220;Yes, Master,&#8221; she replied.&nbsp; But she was already very close.&nbsp; And she was completely naked with her arms held up and out of the way.&nbsp; She was sure that he could already see everything just fine.&nbsp; But she stepped a little closer until her legs touched his knees.

She watched him reach to his sides.&nbsp; Each of his hands captured a breast on the two women who knelt beside his chair.&nbsp; She saw him lift the two abundant globes of flesh and then squeeze them.&nbsp; &#8220;Livilla� Agrippina� what do you think of my new honey-haired toy?&#8221;

Diana furrowed her brow.&nbsp; Those two names sounded familiar but she couldn&#8217;t place them.&nbsp; She wracked her brain trying to remember as she watched Caligula&#8217;s thumbs gliding over the soft outer swells of the large breasts.

&#8220;She looks delightful, Caesar,&#8221; replied one of the women.&nbsp; Diana saw that she was beautiful with black hair, a gorgeous face and a very shapely and trim body that was covered in a sun-kissed skin the reflected her Mediterranean roots.&nbsp; Actually, both women were beautiful and they looked enough alike that they could be sisters.

&#8220;She looks beautiful, Caesar,&#8221; said the other woman.&nbsp; &#8220;Will you be sharing her with us?&#8221;

&#8220;Don&#8217;t I always share everything with my sisters?&#8221; Caligula replied.

Diana&#8217;s eyes opened wide and she sucked in her breath in surprise.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why she recognized the names!&nbsp; They really were Caligula&#8217;s sisters.&nbsp; Oh my gosh, she thought.&nbsp; The stories about incest were true!

In addition to the decadence and cruelty and perversions such as this orgy, the history books said that Caligula had taken his sisters as lovers.&nbsp; But there were supposed to be three of them.&nbsp; Where was the third?

But her professor at Saxbury had warned the class not to believe everything in the history books.&nbsp; &#8220;There are no complete and accurate records from this period,&#8221; he had told his class.&nbsp; &#8220;Most of what we know, or think we know, was recorded by historians decades later.&nbsp; They recorded the oral history which tends to get exaggerated over time.&#8221;

Exaggerated my ass, thought Diana!&nbsp; She was witnessing it first-hand.&nbsp; Well, she had not witnessed the act of sex; at least not yet.&nbsp; But the intimate fondling of the two sisters told her that sex must be part of the equation.

And the sisters wore collars that seemed identical to hers.&nbsp; Had he enslaved Agrippina and Livilla?&nbsp; And what did it mean that she had a collar like the other two naked beauties?

&#8220;Yes, Caesar,&#8221; replied the other sister.&nbsp; &#8220;And we always treasure what you share with your sisters.&#8221;

Caligula bounced each of the breasts in his palms and then pulled his hands back.&nbsp; His eyes never left Diana&#8217;s throughout the conversation.&nbsp; He placed his hands on his thighs and then spoke.&nbsp; &#8220;You may kneel now.&#8221;

Diana jumped slightly as she realized he was talking to her.&nbsp; She lowered herself as gracefully as she could but without the use of her hands it was still awkward and she ended up thudding her knees into the wooden planks of the boat.&nbsp; He looked into her eyes and then reached out, touching her hair.

&#8220;Golden silk,&#8221; he said as he lifted a lock of hair and then let it cascade from his fingers.

&#8220;Like a goddess,&#8221; whispered one of the sisters.

Diana remained as motionless as possible as she fought with her body to try to control her trembling.&nbsp; She was in a bad situation and she knew that it was likely to get worse and that terrified her.&nbsp; A thought flashed through her mind but she was so distracted that it disappeared before she could register it.

He moved his hand lower, stroking the side of her face with his palm.&nbsp; Then he brushed a finger back and forth across her lips.&nbsp; What was she supposed to do?&nbsp; Kiss the finger?&nbsp; Open her mouth?&nbsp; But then her questions were answered for her when he spoke again.

&#8220;Open.&#8221;

She parted her lips, not knowing how wide she was to open.&nbsp; He insinuated a finger between her lips and she opened wider.&nbsp; His finger snaked over her tongue, stroking it softly.&nbsp; Then he moved his finger around her mouth and along her teeth.

He&#8217;s checking to see I have all of my teeth, thought Diana.&nbsp; How demeaning?!?!?!?&nbsp; That puts me in the same class as a horse that&#8217;s being appraised for value.

He gripped her tongue and pulled it out of her mouth.&nbsp; Diana&#8217;s eyes opened wide with surprise at this and wondered what he was checking out this time.&nbsp; He held her tongue and stroked it with the fingers of his other hand.&nbsp; He lifted it and looked at the underside, stroking it also.&nbsp; Then he released it and Diana quickly drew her tongue back into her mouth but kept her lips parted.

He gripped her chin and turned her head back and forth.&nbsp; Her neck rotated inside of the collar and her eyes swiveled in their sockets as she continued to look at him.&nbsp; He had remained expressionless and had not commented on her other than to observe that her hair was golden silk.&nbsp; What was he thinking?

Her chin was tilted up and fingers stroked down her throat until they reached her collar.&nbsp; Then she felt a finger gliding along the lower edge of the collar, tracing it across her flesh.&nbsp; Several times, he slipped his finger between the collar and her flesh.&nbsp; Was he checking to see if it was fitted properly?

His hands moved to her breasts.&nbsp; He stroked downward along the upper swells from the base toward her nipples but his fingertips never reached her sensitive little buds.&nbsp; He placed his fingers together and stroked down the outer swells of her breasts.&nbsp; Diana had to fight with herself to keep from trembling as the man conducted such an intimate inspection of her.&nbsp; He repeated this action several times and then pressed inward, pushing the two pink orbs together.

His fingers moved beneath her breasts and again he brushed them back and forth.&nbsp; Diana felt goose bumps forming over her chest as the fingers tickled her slightly.

He splayed his fingers and lifted her breasts, holding them as if testing their weight.&nbsp; Her eyes remained fixed on his but she could tell that she was blushing at this point.&nbsp; What did he think of her breasts?&nbsp; They were not nearly as large as those of his two sisters.&nbsp; Did he view them as adequate?

Still, his expression did not change.&nbsp; She had no way of reading him.&nbsp; He released her breasts and then gestured upward with his finger.&nbsp; She interpreted that is instruction to stand so she struggled her way clumsily to her feet.&nbsp; Once again, her legs were touching his knees.

He crooked a finger and beckoned her closer as he put his legs together.&nbsp; Diana blushed anew.&nbsp; The only way that she could get closer was to straddle his legs but that would expose her so lewdly.&nbsp; Despite her reluctance, she moved her feet apart and stepped closer.&nbsp; He beckoned again and she moved a little closer.&nbsp; She was not over his cock yet, but it was getting threateningly close.

He reached out again, this time stroking his fingers down her little tuft of fur over her sex.&nbsp; He repeated this action several times and then tugged on the fluff lightly.&nbsp; She thought that she detected a slight smile on his lips and again wondered what he was thinking.

His fingers slid lower and now his touch was on her labia.&nbsp; She stifled a groan of despair as she felt the fingers gliding over her obviously slick petals, wondering again how she could possibly show signs of arousal.&nbsp; But she saw the smile on his face grow just a bit more as he detected the wetness at his fingertips.

He did not push his finger into her sex.&nbsp; She was surprised at that but thankful.&nbsp; Instead, he wiped off the wet tips of his fingers on her little patch of fur, using it as a towel, and then moved his hands onto her hips, slowly stroking them down her thighs.

He leaned back in his throne and that expressionless face was there again.&nbsp; What did that mean?&nbsp; Did she fail the test?&nbsp; And if she did fail, what would that mean for her?

His eyes travelled up her body again.&nbsp; They lingered for a moment at her breasts as he seemed to be giving them a second appraisal and then he looked up into her eyes.&nbsp; He held a finger up and twirled it in the air.&nbsp; She interpreted that as meaning that he wanted her to turn around.

She could not do that standing the way that she was.&nbsp; She had to back up to get his legs out from under her.&nbsp; Once she was clear of them, she turned around, placing her back toward him.

She sucked in her breath at the sight that met her eyes.&nbsp; She had completely forgotten about the orgy that was going on around them.&nbsp; She was so focused on Caligula that she had not even heard the moaning and groaning and grunting.&nbsp; But now that she could see them, the sounds flooded her ears.

A woman was fisting another woman who was laid across a barrel and who was sucking the cock of a male on the other side.&nbsp; A grey-haired man with olive leaves in his hair was fucking a young boy in the ass as the teenager&#8217;s tongue was busy on a young girl&#8217;s pussy.&nbsp; The roulette wheel was still turning but now a male was tied into it with two women whipping his cock and balls.&nbsp; It was unimaginable that all of this perversion actually took place in this highly civilized society.

She felt hands on her hips drawing her backwards.&nbsp; Again, she moved her feet apart and was straddling Caligula&#8217;s legs.&nbsp; Fingers danced down her spin and more goose bumps appeared on her flesh.&nbsp; He gathered her long locks and tucked them into the crook of her left arm to drape down her chest, baring her back.&nbsp; His hands moved slowly down her back until he reached her bottom.&nbsp; He squeezed both of her cheeks and palpated them.

He gripped her hips again and pulled her back some more.&nbsp; She felt his massive cock bump against one of her bottom cheeks and she trembled slightly.

&#8220;Pina, assist me,&#8221; he said.&nbsp; Pina must be his nickname for Agrippina and she saw one of the sisters crawl in front of her and kneel upright.&nbsp; At least now she knew which one was which.&nbsp; She saw Agrippina reach forward between her spread thighs.&nbsp; Then she felt the cock moving against her bottom.&nbsp; Oh, god, she thought.&nbsp; Here is where I get fucked!

&#8220;I am always happy to assist my brother,&#8221; Pina replied to him.&nbsp; But her eyes were on Diana&#8217;s the entire time.

It took some effort on Agrippina&#8217;s part but eventually she was able to bend the cock forward and position it.&nbsp; Diana felt Agrippina&#8217;s fingers touching her petals, parting them.&nbsp; She felt the tip of the cock at her sex and trembled with anticipation and fear.&nbsp; She was not sure that she could handle the monster inside of her body.

Agrippina continued to grip the cock with one hand and placed her other palm on Diana&#8217;s belly.&nbsp; She pushed on the slave girl, causing Diana to back up.&nbsp; As she moved back, she felt the thick bulb at the tip of the cock enter her, stretching her tightly around it.

She sucked in her breath.&nbsp; The thing felt every bit as big as it looked.&nbsp; As Agrippina continued to position her, she felt more and more of the cock slide into her.&nbsp; She felt Caligula&#8217;s hands gripping her waist and then push her downward, slowly impaling her on the thick shaft.

&#8220;Ohmigod!&#8221; she squealed as the monster was fully embedded in her body.&nbsp; It was the first time that she had broken from the Latin she had been speaking for the past two days and she didn&#8217;t even realize that she had uttered the exclamation in English.

&#8220;What did she say?&#8221; asked the emperor.

&#8220;I know not,&#8221; replied Agrippina who had her fingers trapped between the two bodies as her other palm caressed Diana&#8217;s belly.&nbsp; &#8220;Remember that she is a Celt.&nbsp; That must have been her native tongue.&#8221;

&#8220;I think I like Celtic,&#8221; said Caligula as his hands on her waist held her firmly in place on his cock.&nbsp; &#8220;She sounds so melodic.&#8221;

&#8220;Like a goddess,&#8221; whispered Livilla from beside him.&nbsp; Again, the thought raced through her mind but again she was so distracted by the large thing inside of her that she failed to register it.

Caligula used his grip on her waist to urge Diana to rise on the pole.&nbsp; She felt it receding from her body very slowly and again felt every inch of its journey.

&#8220;Pina, you may assist her now,&#8221; he said.

&#8220;Yes, my brother,&#8221; replied Agrippina.&nbsp; Diana opened her eyes wide at the exchange.&nbsp; What did that mean?

Her question was answered, however, as she saw Agrippina lean forward over Caligula&#8217;s legs.&nbsp; The fingers that had been trapped between the two bodies now moved upward and stroked Diana&#8217;s petals which were stretched around the log that was buried within her.&nbsp; She gasped as Agrippina&#8217;s face drew nearer to her sex and then groaned as she saw the tongue snake out and flicker over her clit.&nbsp; She wanted to shout at the woman and tell her to get away from her.&nbsp; She had never been intimate with another girl and had no desire to start now.

But common sense prevailed.&nbsp; Bound and impaled as she was, she knew that she was in no position to resist anything at all.&nbsp; Plus, she could not afford to anger Caligula.&nbsp; She knew his reputation for cruelty.&nbsp; So instead, she just closed her eyes and moaned softly as the delicate tongue flickered over her most sensitive little nubbin.

&#8220;Livi, you may assist the girl too,&#8221; Caligula instructed.&nbsp; Diana&#8217;s eyes flew open wide.&nbsp; Now what?

&#8220;Yes, my brother,&#8221; Livilla replied.&nbsp; The other sister arose and stood beside Diana.&nbsp; Livi turned Diana&#8217;s head to the side and her bound arms followed.&nbsp; Then Livilla leaned in and kissed Diana, wrapping her arms around the bound girl and embracing her.&nbsp; Again, Diana was repulsed.&nbsp; But again, she decided against voicing any objections as the kiss grew passionate.

Caligula started moving Diana in a slow up and down motion.&nbsp; On each upstroke, Agrippina&#8217;s tongue would flutter over her clit and when she was pushed back down, the fingers would do the work of stimulating her little button.&nbsp; Throughout it all, Livilla held her and continued to kiss her.

Diana heard a slurping sound and glanced down during a pause in the kissing.&nbsp; Caligula had leaned forward and was now noisily sucking on Livilla&#8217;s right nipple, drawing as much breast flesh into his mouth as he could.&nbsp; The rumors of incest were turning out to be true.

Livilla held onto Diana with one arm but moved her other hand to the slave girl&#8217;s chest.&nbsp; She lifted a breast, cradling it in her palm as her thumb stroked the tender flesh, urging the sensitive nipple to attention.

Diana felt other hands touching her and glanced around quickly.&nbsp; The other partiers were standing now, pressed against the emperor&#8217;s trio of naked females.&nbsp; One by one, the partiers caressed her or pinched her flesh.&nbsp; Livilla fed Diana&#8217;s nipple to the lips of the boy who was being sodomized earlier and Diana felt the boy suckling.

It was all so overwhelming!&nbsp; So much was happening!&nbsp; She did not want to climax in this way but she could feel all of the stimulation moving her closer to an orgasm as she continued to move up and down on the pole.

The stimulation was obviously getting to Caligula also.&nbsp; She heard his breathing becoming ragged as he continued to suck on Livilla&#8217;s nipple.&nbsp; Finally, he grunted and it felt like a geyser letting loose inside of her as her womb was flooded with his sperm.&nbsp; Somehow, the male&#8217;s orgasm pushed her over the edge and she climaxed also, letting out little coos and mewls.

When she recovered, she opened her eyes.&nbsp; Everyone was still standing around them, smiling in appreciation of the scene they had just witnessed.&nbsp; Agrippina was now kneeling back with her bottom resting on her heels and Livilla busied herself, pulling Diana&#8217;s hair back and allowing it to cascade down her back.

&#8220;She feels like a goddess,&#8221; declared Caligula after he also recovered.&nbsp; His cock was still buried in her pussy although it was softening now.

That elusive thought popped back into her mind again.&nbsp; This time, she recognized it and it registered with her.&nbsp; This time, it gave her an idea.&nbsp; She knew what she had to do.&nbsp; She had a plan now.

&#8220;But I am a goddess, Master,&#8221; Diana replied to the emperor.


To be continued









Chapter 6

&#8220;Why do you wear collars?&#8221; asked Diana as she paused from sucking on Livilla&#8217;s nipple.&nbsp; Agrippina was between her sister&#8217;s legs, lazily swiping her tongue up and down between the slick, opened petals.&nbsp; &#8220;Are you two also slaves?&#8221;

Livilla laughed lightly and then pulled the slave girl&#8217;s head back to her breast.&nbsp; &#8220;No, we aren&#8217;t slaves.&nbsp; And your collar doesn&#8217;t mean that you are a slave.&nbsp; It tells others that you are exclusive to Caligula.&#8221;

&#8220;Oh,&#8221; nodded Diana and then she sucked the ripe stiff nipple back into her mouth.

She had been owned now for about a month and she had quickly gotten over her disgust of lesbian activities.&nbsp; Now she readily and eagerly joined the two sisters for afternoons of feminine lovemaking.

After the night on the orgy barge, they had travelled to the coast.&nbsp; There, they boarded a ship which had slowly taken them down the coast, stopping many times to visit various towns and cities along the way.&nbsp; Now they were in the palace on the Isle of Capri.

Diana had always dreamed of visiting Capri.&nbsp; She had heard that it was beautiful and the reality of what she found lived up to her dreams.&nbsp; The water was gorgeous and the landscape was idyllic.

And she was even adjusting to being owned.&nbsp; That was definitely not something that she had dreamed of as she was growing up.&nbsp; But the reality of it was comfortable.&nbsp; She was completely spoiled and pampered, which she did not mind at all.&nbsp; She could get used to being treated this way.

She still was not comfortable with all of the sex.&nbsp; Actually, the sex itself she was comfortable with.&nbsp; She was constantly having sex with both men and women and she was constantly having earth-shattering orgasms that she never imagined were possible.

But the idea of being a sex slave still did not sit right with her.&nbsp; She was a Saxbury girl, after all.&nbsp; She had been educated to be strong and successful; not to be a pliant bundle of sexual energy.&nbsp; That&#8217;s exactly what she was turning into, though.&nbsp; She was turning into a lusty, uninhibited nymphomaniac, it seemed.

&#8220;But I&#8217;m not exclusive to him,&#8221; she said as she paused again from her suckling duties.&nbsp; Agrippina was the one who responded this time, causing Livilla to groan with frustration as her sister&#8217;s talented tongue was removed from her pussy.

&#8220;Of course you are,&#8221; said Agrippina.&nbsp; &#8220;You don&#8217;t think that you are available to all, do you?&#8221;

&#8220;Ummmm�. yes I do,&#8221; said Diana.&nbsp; &#8220;At least it sure feels that way.&#8221;

Caligula had surprised her.&nbsp; Despite his reputation, she saw none of the cruelty that she had read about.&nbsp; He was a bit cold in his demeanor, but she had not seen any of the violence or terror that he was known for.&nbsp; Maybe he&#8217;s just another man who is misunderstood by history, she thought.

He did like his sex, though, so that part of his reputation had been true.&nbsp; Orgies had been hosted each time that they pulled into a port during their journey to Capri.&nbsp; And now that they were on Capri, orgies were almost a nightly occurrence.&nbsp; Plus, he frequently summoned her during the day to perform sexually.

But she did not feel exclusive to him.&nbsp; He frequently loaned her to others or asked someone to join him as he plundered her body with his cock.&nbsp; She quickly lost track of how many men had used her sexually.&nbsp; And easily as many women had sampled her charms.&nbsp; Life was now an almost nonstop sexual romp.

&#8220;I have sex with others as much as I have with him,&#8221; she went on.

Livilla laughed and pulled Diana&#8217;s head back to her chest, this time guiding the slave&#8217;s lips to her other nipple.&nbsp; Diana readily sucked the puffy nubbin into her mouth and started pulsing it between her lips, letting her tongue flicker over it.

&#8220;You only have sex with ones he gives you to,&#8221; Livilla told her.&nbsp; &#8220;Trust me.&nbsp; With that around your neck, nobody would dare help himself to you without his permission.&nbsp; And trust me on this too.&nbsp; He only shares you with very important people.&#8221;

Diana pulled her head back to ask her next question and then quickly returned it to the breast, gobbling up the swollen nipple.&nbsp; She had grown to desire the luscious breasts of Agrippina and Livilla.&nbsp; It was very soothing for some reason to be suckling at the abundant, warm mounds.

She liked all of them, actually.&nbsp; She guessed them to be five or six years older than she was and they were absolutely beautiful.&nbsp; She actually felt almost homely when she was in their presence.&nbsp; But they had taken a shine to her and seemed to find her attractive.&nbsp; Not only did she like their spectacular bodies, though, she also liked them as people.&nbsp; They were very good to her and treated her with kindness and respect, in spite of her being a slave.

Even Caligula was not much older than her.&nbsp; She knew that he was only about twenty eight which was amazing in itself.&nbsp; A twenty eight year old ruling the greatest empire on earth!

&#8220;Important people?&nbsp; Like who?&#8221;

Livilla&#8217;s breathing was becoming more ragged at this point.&nbsp; The tongue between her thighs and the lips stimulating her nipples were edging her closer to an orgasm.

&#8220;Senators, ambassadors, generals,&#8221; Livilla replied with halting language.&nbsp; &#8220;That sort of people.&#8221;

&#8220;Wow,&#8221; breathed Diana.&nbsp; She had no idea!&nbsp; To her, they had all just been horny, older, naked people.&nbsp; That was amazing!

Livilla finally tensed and let out a long, low groan.&nbsp; She clutched Diana&#8217;s head to her breast, suffocating the beautiful slave in the soft, pillowy flesh.&nbsp; Fortunately, she only held Diana briefly and&nbsp; the slave girl was eventually able to start breathing again.

&#8220;What would you like to do today, Diana?&#8221; asked Livilla as the three of them lounged together after each enjoying very satisfying orgasms.

Diana furrowed her brow and thought for a moment.&nbsp; &#8220;Could we try some archery?&nbsp; I haven&#8217;t done that in a while.&#8221;

&#8220;Archery?&#8221; asked Agrippina as her fingers danced around Diana&#8217;s left nipple.&nbsp; &#8220;What is archery?&#8221;

Hmmm, thought Diana.&nbsp; Maybe she used the wrong word.&nbsp; Or maybe she had butchered the pronunciation which was more likely.&nbsp; &#8220;Yes, archery.&nbsp; &#8220;You know.&nbsp; Like bows and arrows and shooting at targets.&#8221;

Livilla raised her eyebrows at the request.&nbsp; &#8220;You know how to do that?&#8221;

Diana nodded.&nbsp; &#8220;Of course I do.&nbsp; I used to do it all the time.&#8221;

The two sisters agreed that it would be archery today and got up and dressed.&nbsp; They were stunning naked and were equally stunning with clothing on.&nbsp; They always wore the most elegant garments.

Diana, as usual, was naked.&nbsp; She did occasionally wear clothing when someone visited the palace for official business but other than those occasions, she was kept naked.&nbsp; At least she was getting a nice tan out of it.&nbsp; Her entire body was now a nice toasty brown and her blonde hair was getting lighter and lighter as it was bleached by the sun.

The sisters led their charge to the armory where they collected three bows and quivers full of arrows.&nbsp; Then they walked out into the countryside for an afternoon of sport.

&#8220;We need something to shoot at,&#8221; said Diana as she looked around.&nbsp; &#8220;Where do the men practice?&nbsp; Maybe there are some targets there.&#8221;

&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the men practice,&#8221; replied Agrippina.&nbsp; &#8220;At least I have never seen them.&#8221;

&#8220;I see a haystack over there,&#8221; pointed Diana.&nbsp; &#8220;That should do.&#8221;

They walked toward the pile and then Diana created little targets.&nbsp; She used leaves for targets and a piece of cloth that she found.&nbsp; She twisted a vine into a circle and placed it on the side of the haystack.&nbsp; &#8220;There we go.&nbsp; Who wants to s tart?&#8221;

Agrippina went first.&nbsp; She looked like she had very little experience with a bow, if any.&nbsp; She hit the haystack but her arrows did not land anywhere near the targets.

Livilla went next.&nbsp; She too seemed to be handling a bow for the first time.&nbsp; She shot six arrows, none of which even hit the mound of hay.&nbsp; Two hit the ground in front of it.&nbsp; Two sailed over the top of it.&nbsp; And one went to each side.

Diana went last.&nbsp; It had been several months since she shot a bow on her archery team at school and she hoped that she did not embarrass herself today due to the lack of practice.&nbsp; But she couldn&#8217;t be as bad as the two sisters.

&#8220;I&#8217;m going for the circle first,&#8221; she said.&nbsp; She nocked her arrow and pulled back the bow string.&nbsp; She aimed and then released, watching the arrow sail through the air.&nbsp; It landed dead center in the circle.

&#8220;Ouch!&#8221; she exclaimed.&nbsp; The bow string had snapped at the side of her breast after she released it.&nbsp; She realized that female archers should wear something to keep their breasts out of the way unless they wanted punishment like that.

&#8220;Very good, Diana,&#8221; praised Livilla.

&#8220;The strip of cloth next,&#8221; Diana said.&nbsp; She shot another arrow and once again caught the side of her breast with the string.&nbsp; But the arrow sliced neatly into the piece of cloth.

&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you the little warrior?&#8221; smiled Agrippina.&nbsp; &#8220;You are very good.&#8221;

Diana thanked the sisters and then shot the rest of her arrows.&nbsp; Each one hit its intended target and each one was securely in the center of the target.

&#8220;How did you get so good at that?&#8221; asked Agrippina as they walked back to the palace.

&#8220;As the goddess of the hunt, I have to be good with a bow,&#8221; was Diana&#8217;s reply.&nbsp; That was the plan that she had come up with a month earlier on the day she was sold and was now just starting to put in motion.&nbsp; She had to find a way to elevate her station in life.&nbsp; And the only way that she could think of was to become a goddess; or at least have them believe she was a goddess.

Both sisters stopped and turned, looking at the petite blonde.&nbsp; She saw that their foreheads were furrowed as if they were in deep thought.&nbsp; She hoped that they would start to believe.&nbsp; And she hoped that they would convince their brother that he owned a goddess.&nbsp; Surely that would elevate her from her slavery status.

&#8220;We have never been with a goddess before,&#8221; said Agrippina.

&#8220;Well, now you have,&#8221; replied Diana.

&#8220;I would have thought that you were Venus, the goddess of love,&#8221; said Livilla.&nbsp; &#8220;Your lovemaking skills are out of this world.&#8221;

&#8220;Hmmmffff,&#8221; snorted Diana.&nbsp; &#8220;My sister Venus is nothing but a slut.&nbsp; She has no idea what making love is all about.&#8221;&nbsp; Diana knew that she was hamming it up at this point but she had to act like a goddess and she assumed that goddesses got a little snooty now and then.

The sisters studied her a little longer and then Agrippina spoke again.&nbsp; &#8220;Are you really a goddess?&#8221;

Diana stood facing the two with her feet shoulder width apart.&nbsp; She placed her hands on her hips and puffed out her chest.&nbsp; &#8220;Don&#8217;t I look like a goddess?&#8221;

The sisters paused for a moment before replying.&nbsp; &#8220;No,&#8221; they said in unison.

&#8220;Hmmmffff,&#8221; Diana snorted again.&nbsp; &#8220;Have you ever seen a mortal girl shoot a bow like that?&nbsp; Only the goddess of the hunt could do that.&#8221;

&#8220;But you are a Celt,&#8221; said Livilla.&nbsp; &#8220;Maybe all Celtic women can shoot a bow.&#8221;

It was Diana&#8217;s turn to furrow her brow.&nbsp; That might be right.&nbsp; She had never studied the Celts so she had no idea.&nbsp; She decided that she would have to keep working on her goddess persona and credentials.&nbsp; Maybe there were additional things she could do to convince them of her goddessness.

&#8220;I assure you that Celtic women cannot shoot like that,&#8221; she told them.

They went back to the palace.&nbsp; The sun was getting low in the sky and they needed to prepare.&nbsp; Another orgy was scheduled for tonight.

Diana seemed to be the star attraction this night.&nbsp; Time and again, naked people approached and asked Caesar to be able to sample her charms.&nbsp; He granted most of them their wishes and Diana was whisked through a long series of lovers.

The first one led her across the room and leaned back against the wall.&nbsp; He pushed her to her knees and her task immediately became clear to her.&nbsp; She parted her lips and sucked the male&#8217;s moderate cock into her mouth, letting it glide slowly in and out as her tongue bathed it and aroused it.

She had become emboldened during the day as she started her journey toward goddeshood.&nbsp; She also felt much better about herself after learning the meaning of her collar.&nbsp; She might be property but she was very private property to a very important man.

She was also curious after her discussions with the sisters.&nbsp; They told her that she was only loaned to very important and powerful people.&nbsp; She wondered about the grey-haired owner of the cock that was pumping in and out of her mouth.&nbsp; She pulled her head back, letting the cock pop free for a moment, and asked her question before sucking it back into her mouth.

&#8220;What do you do for a living?&#8221;

The man made a lengthy statement in response but she did not recognize a single word.&nbsp; An ambassador, she supposed.&nbsp; Well, he was a good one to have for a blowjob.&nbsp; At least she would not have to try to carry on a conversation with him.

She glanced around the room at one point as she was giving her jaws a break from all of the sucking.&nbsp; Her hand pumped up and down the slippery shaft that she had been sucking on moments before.&nbsp; People were coupling lewdly all over the place, just like every other night.&nbsp; It was truly amazing!

She noticed that Caligula had kept his two sisters with him and gasped at what she saw them doing.&nbsp; Caligula was prone and Livilla was straddling his hips and was riding up and down on his cock, facing away from his head.&nbsp; Agrippina was kneeling between Caligula&#8217;s spread legs, kissing her sister and fondling her breasts.&nbsp; This was the first time that she had seen the sexual act between the brother and his sisters.&nbsp; She knew that it had to be taking place but this was the first time that she had witnessed it.

The ambassador put his hand on top of her head and rotated it back to where it had been earlier.&nbsp; Obediently, she opened her mouth again and started sucking until she was able to coax his seed from him, swallowing the little swimmers that he ejaculated into her mouth.

Shortly after her sperm appetizer was consumed, she was claimed by another grey-haired male.&nbsp; This one decided to enjoy her pussy and took her from behind as she knelt on all fours.

&#8220;What do you do for a living?&#8221; she asked him as his cock enjoyed her warm, velvety love canal.

&#8220;I make the world a better place,&#8221; he replied as he thrust deeply to emphasize his last word.&nbsp; &#8220;I see to it that all men can enjoy the fruits of their labor.&nbsp; I eliminate things that are unjust.&#8221;&nbsp; He blathered on and on without ever really answering her question, thrusting deep into her sex to emphasize what he thought were key points in his speech.

A senator, she guessed based on all of the hot air that he was spewing into the room.

She drifted off into her own thoughts as the male used her body for pleasure.&nbsp; She was going to get pregnant one of these days.&nbsp; She had to.&nbsp; It was inevitable with all of the sperm that she was receiving.&nbsp; She knew that she was safe during the initial days of her captivity but eventually the protection of the birth control pills that she had been taking back at school would wear off.

What would happen to her once she did become pregnant?&nbsp; Would she still be desired by the emperor?&nbsp; Would she be cast aside and replaced by a more svelte body?&nbsp; And how would her baby be raised?&nbsp; She hoped that the baby would not be a slave also.

She was brought back to the present by a particularly deep thrust that banged into her cervix and caused her to grunt with pain.&nbsp; The senator was still bloviating about his importance as he pounded into her.&nbsp; But eventually the speech was brought to an end as he too grunted and spewed his little swimmers into her body, each of which was wiggling madly toward her defenseless little egg.

The senator pulled out of her and gave her ass a pat.&nbsp; Then he walked off without saying a word about her or about her performance.&nbsp; She usually received a lot of praise but realized that her most recent lover was probably too self-absorbed to even notice whether or not he liked her.&nbsp; Definitely a politician, she decided.

She got to her feet to return to her owner.&nbsp; That was the usual way of things.&nbsp; She would be borrowed and taken some place to be used.&nbsp; And then she would return to Caesar.

She spotted him across the room.&nbsp; He was still with his two sisters but Agrippina was now the one riding his cock.&nbsp; He was lying on his back and Diana realized that was usually how he took her also.&nbsp; She wondered why he liked it that way since most men seemed to prefer being on top or taking her from behind.&nbsp; As she got closer, she started to realize the answer.&nbsp; Agrippina was leaning forward and dangling her breasts over his face.&nbsp; Diana saw the full mounds swaying back and forth as Agrippina moved her chest and Caligula seemed to be playing a game, trying to catch the succulent, puffy nipples in his teeth as they passed by.

Livilla was lying between Caligula&#8217;s legs, propping herself up by her elbows.&nbsp; She sucked one of the emperor&#8217;s heavy balls into her mouth, pulsing it in and out a few times before releasing it.&nbsp; Then she would run her tongue between Agrippina&#8217;s bottom cheeks and stab it into her sister&#8217;s little pucker.&nbsp; There was absolutely no denying the rumors about incest at this point.&nbsp; 

She was intercepted before she reached the trio by a naked woman.&nbsp; The woman lightly gripped her elbow and steered her away from Caesar and toward an open area.&nbsp; There, she laid Diana on her back and positioned herself above the slave girl in a sixty nine position.&nbsp; Diana immediately started licking the pussy above her face and realized that she had not yet climaxed this evening.&nbsp; Well, that should be remedied soon enough, she thought as she felt the woman feasting on her sex.

&#8220;What do you do for a living?&#8221; asked Diana after slurping away for several minutes.&nbsp; Her question was met with guttural, clicking sounds that Diana thought even her own people would not be able to decipher; obviously a foreigner.&nbsp; Probably an ambassador&#8217;s wife.

At least this ambassador had good taste.&nbsp; She judged the woman to be in her mid-thirties and was very pretty with long black hair and a very trim and curvy body.

Diana felt her tummy starting to flutter, which was a sure sign that she was moving toward an orgasm.&nbsp; She had grown to the point of needing climaxes and realized again that she was turning into a nymphomaniac.&nbsp; She was especially needy during orgies where there were so many erotic stimuli all around her.

When she first realized this change in her personality, she was horrified.&nbsp; That was not who she was!&nbsp; She was not a slut and did not want to be thought of as one.&nbsp; As she thought more about it, however, she realized that it really didn&#8217;t matter.&nbsp; Back at Saxbury in the twenty first century, she worried about her reputation and always made sure that she never did anything to tarnish it.&nbsp; But that was thousands of miles away from here and thousands of years from now.&nbsp; It didn&#8217;t matter to her life here.&nbsp; And she realized that being a nymphomaniac as a sex slave might not be such a bad thing.&nbsp; In fact, maybe it was an asset that she was so easily aroused and so sexually needy.

This woman was good!&nbsp; Diana felt the ambassador&#8217;s wife bringing her to the edge of an orgasm over and over again but the woman always pulled back and paused when she sensed that the slave beneath her was about to erupt.&nbsp; She felt the woman use her tongue and lips and fingers to arouse her and felt like a swirling mass of erotic pleasure.&nbsp; She even felt the woman&#8217;s teeth come into play as her clit was lightly bitten or her labia were gently gnawed.&nbsp; She desperately wanted to climax but she also desperately wanted this exquisite torture to go on forever.&nbsp; 

Yes, she realized.&nbsp; I&#8217;m definitely a slut now!

She was surprised when a knee bumped into the top of her head.&nbsp; She opened her eyes and saw that a male had knelt between the woman&#8217;s legs and saw a raging erection waving in the air.&nbsp; She saw the man&#8217;s hand wrapped around his long narrow shaft, spreading grease on it.&nbsp; There were huge bowls of grease spread around the room and the revelers used it liberally to enhance their sexual gratification.

The shaft reminded her of Octavius and she wondered how he and Claudius were faring in Germania.&nbsp; At first, she had been angry with them for enslaving her and raping her, only to then sell her.&nbsp; But over time, her anger had receded.&nbsp; She realized that they were only doing what Roman males did: rape and pillage.

The cock was positioned between the bottom cheeks of the ambassador&#8217;s wife and then she watched as it slowly disappeared, slicing into the woman&#8217;s bowels.&nbsp; Diana felt the tongue that was licking her pussy pause for a moment and then heard the woman moan as she adjusted to the anal intrusion.&nbsp; But then the tongue started fluttering and scooping again and once again, Diana was being moved toward an orgasm.

&#8220;I conquer thee,&#8221; exclaimed the owner of the long slender cock once it was fully embedded in the woman&#8217;s ass.

A general, thought Diana.

She was fascinated as she watched the shaft gliding in and out of the woman.&nbsp; It moved slowly inward and then retreated just as slowly.&nbsp; As it pulled out, the sphincter seemed to grip it and cling to it almost as if it was trying to keep the thing inside of her.&nbsp; She had never seen anyone being taken anally this close.&nbsp; It was mesmerizing to watch.

Tongues kept fluttering and the pole kept pumping.&nbsp; Several more times, Diana was brought to the edge, only to be denied.&nbsp; She was whimpering with her need now and the sight of the cock penetrating the shapely ass above her was only adding to her neediness.

Eventually, it had to end, and it did.&nbsp; The male was the first to tense and Diana watched as his balls almost seemed to dance with every load of sperm that he shot into the woman&#8217;s bowels.&nbsp; Diana erupted next and let out a soft, long moan as her belly rippled and erotic thrills shot through her body.&nbsp; But she kept her tongue moving and soon after that the woman groaned as an orgasm wracked her naked and sweaty body.

Caesar had a boy kneeling between his legs when Diana finally made her way back to him at the end of the evening.&nbsp; The boy&#8217;s lips were stretched tightly around the massive shaft as his head bobbed up and down.&nbsp; This was not the first time that she had seen Caligula enjoying the flesh of the same sex but for some reason it always surprised her.

Livilla and Agrippina were sixty-nining together in front of Caligula, obviously putting on a show for their brother.&nbsp; It looked like each of them had a tail now as she saw long locks of hair sprouting from their assholes.&nbsp; That was another first for her.&nbsp; She wondered what that was all about.

Caligula spotted her once she knelt beside his throne and tapped the top of the boy&#8217;s head.&nbsp; He told the teenager to back away but to stay.&nbsp; The boy backed up and then Caligula beckoned Diana to take over where the boy left off.

Diana crawled between his legs and quickly started moving her lips up and down the beefy shaft.&nbsp; Once again, she was amazed that she could get any part of it into her mouth but once again she found her lips gliding up and down its length.

The boy moved behind Diana and swathed his cock with the grease from the nearest bowl.&nbsp; She felt his cock piercing her asshole but breathed a sigh of relief at the smallness of the thing.&nbsp; Soon it was pumping in and out of her body as her mouth devoured as much of her owner&#8217;s cock as it could.

The evening ended with the whipping of one of the wives as punishment for her crimes.&nbsp; She was found guilty of infidelity and Caesar sentenced her to forty lashes.&nbsp; Diana thought that the verdict was absurd after all of the decadence of the evening.&nbsp; Everyone here had been unfaithful!!!

And she thought that the sentence was way too severe.&nbsp; The woman&#8217;s back was a bloody mess after the punishment had been administered and Diana knew that the woman would be scarred for life.&nbsp; It was Diana&#8217;s first introduction to Caligula&#8217;s cruel side and she vowed to be a very good girl so he would have no reason to punish her.


Chapter 6

&#8220;What?!?!?!?!?&#8221; sputtered Diana as she lifted her face from Livilla&#8217;s sex.&nbsp; The two sisters and the slave girl were spending another intimate morning together.&nbsp; &#8220;He has had four wives?&nbsp; How old is he anyway?&#8221;

Agrippina spread Diana&#8217;s bottom cheeks and circled her tongue around the little pucker there.&nbsp; &#8220;Yes, four wives.&nbsp; And he is in his twenty seventh year; soon to enter his twenty eighth.&#8221;

Wow,&#8221; breathed Diana as she returned her lips to Livilla&#8217;s petals and started licking and probing again with her tongue.&nbsp; They must start really early here, she thought.&nbsp; She had no idea!

&#8220;What happened to his wives?&#8221; asked Diana as she took another quick break from her task.&nbsp; But Livilla quickly pushed her head down and she resumed her licking actions.

Livilla was moaning too much to be able to reply.&nbsp; Agrippina moved a fingertip to Diana&#8217;s asshole and pushed inward, letting her finger sink into the girl&#8217;s bottom and eliciting a moan from the girl before answering the question.&nbsp; &#8220;They each died.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t know how and we don&#8217;t ask.&nbsp; They just disappeared.&#8221;

That&#8217;s odd, thought Diana as she felt the finger worming around in her bottom and she kept her own tongue moving over Livilla&#8217;s clit.&nbsp; Did he have them killed?&nbsp; Were they kept somewhere, maybe in some kind of dungeon?

Livilla finally climaxed and they got ready to go shoot their bows again.&nbsp; Over the past six months, they had archery practice around twice each week.&nbsp; Diana patiently trained and coached the two sisters and they were becoming quite proficient.&nbsp; They were not as good as Diana.&nbsp; But they weren&#8217;t goddesses either so that was to be expected.

She had even solved the problem of the bow string.&nbsp; Despite being naked as they walked to their practice area, she always brought a strip of cloth with her.&nbsp; When it was time for her to shoot, she would wrap the strip of cloth around her chest and bind her breasts, squashing them as flat as she could against her chest by pulling the cloth tight and tying it off.&nbsp; It usually kept her breasts from being struck by the string.&nbsp; And even when the string did hit one of her full, soft mounds, it didn&#8217;t hurt as much because of the extra padding.

She did look comical, though.&nbsp; She would be completely naked other than for her makeshift little bandera top as she handled the bow.&nbsp; The others frequently giggled at the sight of the little half-naked warrior.

On days when she was not summoned by the emperor or his two sisters, she would wander around.&nbsp; There were no cages or chains to bind her these days and she had complete freedom of movement.&nbsp; Caesar trusted her not to escape.&nbsp; Plus, they were on an island now.&nbsp; Where would she escape to?

She frequently visited the gardens where slaves toiled in the soil, tending their flowers and crops.&nbsp; She often helped them, finding serenity as her fingers grubbed around in the dirt.&nbsp; It was almost therapeutic for her.&nbsp; It was so different from the bawdy excesses and decadence that consumed the rest of her existence these days.

And she found many of the slaves to be very interesting.&nbsp; Most of the slaves who worked the earth were males although there were still quite a few females, especially in the flower gardens.&nbsp; But it was mostly the males that she found fascinating.&nbsp; Most of them spoke Latin so she could talk to them directly.&nbsp; Some did not, however, and she had to speak to them through translators when she could find them.&nbsp; But their stories and backgrounds were fascinating.

One day, she was working in a flower bed with an elderly male who obviously did not know the first thing about gardening.&nbsp; His rows were not straight.&nbsp; He had flowers in the wrong places based on the sunlight they would receive.&nbsp; And he didn&#8217;t speak Latin.

Throughout the course of the afternoon, she helped him improve his flower bed and instructed him as best she could through the use of a crude sign language.&nbsp; When she wanted show that a flower needed sunlight, she would point up at the sun and then place her hands by her face and smile brightly, hoping that he would understand &#8216;sun&#8217; in her gestures.

When she wanted to show him that a flower did not like direct sunlight, she would raise a finger and waggle it at the sun, saying &#8216;tsk, tsk.&#8217;&nbsp; Then she would cover her eyes with her fingers.

By the end of the afternoon, they had replanted the entire bed.&nbsp; His rows were neat now and his flowers would be much happier going forward.&nbsp; She learned through one of the translators later that the elderly male had been the king of an eastern European nation that had been conquered by Caligula.

Another male spoke Latin so she was able to converse with him.&nbsp; His garden bed too was a wreck.&nbsp; But she taught him how to use the sun and how to collect the rain water so that his plants would flourish.&nbsp; Within a week of helping him, his bed was an explosion of color instead of the drab, bedraggled stalks that had lived there before.

This man had been a general in the Legions.&nbsp; But he had fallen out of favor with Caligula&#8217;s predecessor, Tiberius.&nbsp; Instead of crucifying him, Tiberius had sent the general to serve as a slave in the Capri palace.&nbsp; Diana was sure that this must be totally humiliating to the general but he never showed any signs of his shame.

Diana felt sorry for the man.&nbsp; He was obviously a very proud man, a warrior, who had been reduced to a naked slave who spent his days working the soil.&nbsp; She also felt sorry for him because he was constantly erect in her presence.&nbsp; He apologized profusely many times and she was always understanding.&nbsp; She wanted to take care of his problem but she was afraid that it might get him killed.&nbsp; So she just toiled in the soil alongside of him.

Despite the sad stories, they were fascinating people and she enjoyed getting to know them.&nbsp; But she would be tending the gardens even if she was doing it alone.&nbsp; She found it calming and therapeutic.

She had always enjoyed grubbing in the dirt.&nbsp; Even as a small girl, she used to plant and tend crops.&nbsp; Her parents were agriculture professors so she picked up some of her knowledge and skills just by siting at the dinner table at home.&nbsp; But she also spent every summer while she was growing up living on various farms.&nbsp; They were research farms where new seeds and techniques were tested and her parents worked there to advance their research.

That allowed her to run and frolic in the fields when she was very small.&nbsp; And as she grew older, she started to learn techniques for making things grow.&nbsp; She also learned how to care for livestock and even helped birth a calf one summer.

The gardens of the palace were doing very well thanks to her toiling with the garden slaves.&nbsp; But when she walked through the fields, she saw underutilized land and struggling crops.&nbsp; They had horrible farming techniques here.

She finally decided to talk to the overseer of the garden and farming slaves.&nbsp; She offered to hold classes to teach the slaves methods for being more successful with the land that they were tending.

&#8220;Just who do you think you are, girl?&#8221; asked the overseer, obviously insulted that a slave could think that she had anything to offer other than her body.

&#8220;I am Diana,&#8221; she replied politely, but surprised at the question.&nbsp; She assumed that everyone in the palace would know who she was by now.

&#8220;I know your name, girl,&#8221; he said as he looked down at her.&nbsp; &#8220;But what makes you think that anyone would listen to your babbling?&#8221;

&#8220;Because I am Diana,&#8221; she replied.&nbsp; Once again, her feet were shoulder width apart and her hands were on her hips.&nbsp; She puffed out her chest and looked back as defiantly as she could.&nbsp; &#8220;I am Diana, goddess of fertility.&#8221;

The man laughed.&nbsp; &#8220;Oh are you, little one?&nbsp; And maybe I&#8217;m Neptune.&#8221;

&#8220;Doubtful,&#8221; she said in response.&nbsp; &#8220;But if you have any doubts about who I am, let me give you a tour of the gardens.&nbsp; Do you remember how run-down they were?&nbsp; I have made the land fertile for the plants.&#8221;

&#8220;It is probably just favorable weather,&#8221; he said, dismissively.

&#8220;They why haven&#8217;t the crops thrived also?&#8221; she shot back at him quickly.&nbsp; &#8220;Why is it just the flowers that are responding?&nbsp; How much longer do you think that you will have this job if you allow the crops to fail as they are currently?&#8221;

That last question obviously got to the male.&nbsp; She saw the blood drain from his face and she saw fear in his expression.

&#8220;Allow me to help your workers,&#8221; she said.&nbsp; &#8220;I will teach them.&#8221;

And so it was that Diana ended up teaching the first agriculture seminar in history.&nbsp; The room was packed with naked slaves as their equally naked professor went through her topics.&nbsp; She taught proper irrigation techniques and how contour farming would help hold the water for the plants.&nbsp; She taught them about crop rotation and soil preparation and making the most out of the sunlight.

Within a week, people started to notice a difference.&nbsp; The fields were suddenly greener.&nbsp; By the time that the moon had gone through all of its phases, the fields were vibrant with healthy crops.

Throughout this period, orgies continued to be an almost nightly event.&nbsp; This entire society seemed to be immersed in decadence.&nbsp; At least the aristocratic society was.&nbsp; She did not know if the peasants embraced all of the perversions but the wealthy segments of society certainly did.&nbsp; And none seemed to embrace them more fully than Caligula.&nbsp; It seemed that he lived for his orgies and excesses.

Once again, an orgy was starting and Diana watched as the partiers gathered in the great hall.&nbsp; It always amazed her that everyone always wore their finest outfits to these events.&nbsp; In her mind, why bother?&nbsp; Everyone quickly lost all of their clothes so what did it matter what you wore?

Caligula had his two sisters on either side of him as he greeted the guests.&nbsp; The three of them wore elegant white togas that were intricately embroidered with gold thread.&nbsp; They looked very royal.&nbsp; Diana was also with them but she was kneeling beside Agrippina and was naked other than for her collar and cuffs.&nbsp; But at least they were gold so she too felt elegant.

The wine started flowing and, as expected, the sex began.&nbsp; The first to break the ice was a woman who started kissing another woman.&nbsp; The kissee did not resist the kisser at all and quickly it turned passionate.&nbsp; Soon, the kisser was on her knees with her head under the kissee&#8217;s toga, obviously finding another place to plant her lips.&nbsp; They were both still fully clothed at this point.&nbsp; It won&#8217;t be long now, thought Diana.

Sure enough, the kisser stood.&nbsp; As she arose, she held the hem of the kissee&#8217;s toga, drawing it over her head and leaving her naked.&nbsp; Then the kisser let her own toga fall to the floor and knelt down to resume what she had started moments earlier.

Diana usually recognized some people from previous orgies although normally there were many more newcomers than reapeaters.&nbsp; People must travel to Capri just to be seen at the emperor&#8217;s orgies, she thought, because there was no way that so many people lived on this island.

Togas were dropping to the floor with great regularity at this point.&nbsp; Diana saw movement out of the corner of her eye and saw that Caligula was loosening the pin that held up Livilla&#8217;s toga.&nbsp; Diana watched the garment glide down the sister&#8217;s body to puddle at her ankles and sucked in her breath as the beautiful body was displayed.

She knew that she should not react this way.&nbsp; After all, she frequently saw the sisters naked and frequently made love to them.&nbsp; But it was still breathtaking to her when one of them was unveiled and she felt little erotic thrills racing through her body.

She watched as Caesar kissed his sister and lifted her breasts before leaning down to kiss each of the succulent mounds.&nbsp; Livilla&#8217;s eyes fluttered as Caligula sucked each nipple into his mouth and Diana heard a soft moan escaping from Livilla&#8217;s lips.

Caligula turned and repeated his actions with Agrippina and Diana&#8217;s reactions were the same as her nudity was revealed.&nbsp; Finally, after toying with her breasts for a while, he turned back to the crowd.&nbsp; He looked around until he saw the person he was seeking and then raised his hand, beckoning him forward.

&#8220;They are yours for the evening,&#8221; he told the man who approached.&nbsp; &#8220;May your family enjoy them.&#8221;

&#8220;My family thanks you, Caesar,&#8221; the man replied.&nbsp; &#8220;They are wonderful gifts from you.&#8221;

Family?&nbsp; What was that all about?&nbsp; She would have to keep track of where the sisters were taken so she could see what all of that meant.

Finally, Caligula dropped his own toga and stood naked, looking out over the new sea of naked flesh.&nbsp; Everyone had already stripped or been stripped by this point and decadence abounded in the hall.

Caesar was only partially erect and Diana was given the task of hardening him completely.&nbsp; She knelt at his feet and sucked the huge thing into her mouth, setting about her latest chore as Caligula surveyed his subjects.

As usual, he stiffened quickly and she soon found herself bent over a table as he thrust into her from behind.&nbsp; She could tell by his slow, leisurely pace, though, that her pussy was just a stopping point for tonight&#8217;s sexual journey.&nbsp; He was only going to use her to keep himself hard until he selected a partner or two for himself.&nbsp; Then she would once again be loaned to someone to provide them with decadent entertainment.

As she felt him stretching her and filling her, she too surveyed the room.&nbsp; Who will claim her tonight?&nbsp; She had spotted a woman who she recognized from an earlier orgy and who also spoke Latin.&nbsp; The woman had been kind to her that night and provided her with an endless stream of orgasms.&nbsp; But she also spotted a man from an earlier orgy who had been less kind.&nbsp; It seemed that everything he did to her was intended to inflict pain or humiliation.

Caesar had obviously selected his partner for the evening because he withdrew from her sex with an audible popping sound.&nbsp; Diana straightened up and saw him gesturing again.&nbsp; Soon, an under-age girl appeared and he led her to a cushion.

Diana shook her head as she realized that someone so young would be plundered by the emperor.&nbsp; But then she realized that the girl was only under-age by the standards of two thousand years from now.&nbsp; Here, in ancient Rome, it was common for girls of thirteen or fourteen to be married.&nbsp; This one with Caligula tonight looked closer to sixteen and she could already be someone&#8217;s wife, for all that Diana knew.

Again, she wondered who would claim her but she did not have to wonder for very long.&nbsp; As soon as Caligula started the girl sucking on his cock, a woman approached Diana.&nbsp; She fed a rope through one of the rings on Diana&#8217;s collar and then led her away, using the rope as a leash to control the beauty who she had claimed.

Diana rolled her eyes at the silence of the woman, thinking that it was probably another ambassador&#8217;s wife who could not speak her language.&nbsp; She much preferred it when she could communicate or at least understand comments being made.&nbsp; But the woman was very pretty and she admired the heart-shaped ass as it wiggled its way through the crowd toward its destination.

Its destination turned out to be a new toy that Caligula had the tradesmen make for him.&nbsp; It was a very recent addition and Diana had only seen it used once.&nbsp; She had never experienced it herself.

It was a large round frame made of sturdy wood.&nbsp; Attachment points were spread generously around the frame allowing someone to secure another into it in a variety of ways.&nbsp; And the frame was supported on each side in a way that it could be swiveled to rotate its captive into many different positions.

The woman stopped and kissed Diana.&nbsp; The slave obediently returned the kiss as she felt the woman&#8217;s hands roaming over her naked flesh.&nbsp; She felt the woman&#8217;s full breasts pressing against her own, flattening them against her chest.&nbsp; Little erotic thrills once again rushed through her body during the heated embrace and once again she was reminded of what a little slut she had become.

The woman gave Diana&#8217;s ass a spank, presumably to announce that kissing time was over and then she spoke.&nbsp; &#8220;I have been looking forward to the day when I could enjoy you.&nbsp; I have heard so many good things about you from my husband.&#8221;

She spoke Latin!&nbsp; That was a relief to Diana.&nbsp; At least now she could speak to her temporary owner.&nbsp; But who could her husband be?

&#8220;I hope that you find me pleasing, Mistress,&#8221; replied Diana.

The leash was removed and the woman placed a stool next to the frame for Diana to stand on.&nbsp; Then she beckoned over a tall man who bound the slave&#8217;s wrists to ropes leading to some of the attachment points.&nbsp; Her wrists were circled by thick leather which she became thankful for once the stool was pulled away.&nbsp; She was left dangling inside the frame with her arms spread widely above her head.&nbsp; Ropes, or even her own golden cuffs, would have been too painful.&nbsp; At least the leather distributed her weight and did not dig too tightly into her flesh.

The woman knelt and grasped an ankle at a time, stretching her legs outward.&nbsp; A leather cuff was wrapped around each ankle and, by the time the woman was finished, Diana was completely immobile inside the frame in an upright spread-eagle position.&nbsp; She was completely exposed and vulnerable like that.

She glanced around the room and then did a double take as she saw the sisters.&nbsp; Now she knew what &#8216;family&#8217; had meant earlier.&nbsp; At least she assumed that it was a family.

A man and a teenage boy were enjoying Agrippina.&nbsp; She was unbound but she was wedged between the two males with the man fucking her pussy and the son obviously fucking her ass.&nbsp; The teenage girl was lying face up on a table and the mother was feasting on the daughter&#8217;s breasts, occasionally catching a nipple with her teeth and stretching the nicely formed mounds away from the girl&#8217;s chest.&nbsp; And Livilla was bent over the table with her wrists bound behind her back as she used her tongue to toy with the girl&#8217;s sex.

It was the first time that she had ever seen one of the sisters bound.&nbsp; Diana was frequently bound during orgies but she assumed that was what one did with a slave.&nbsp; But maybe all was fair during an orgy.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t know.

But if that was the case, what differentiated a slave from a free woman?&nbsp; She had been told that it was not the collar.&nbsp; That merely denoted exclusivity.&nbsp; Maybe it was just the metal cuffs that circled her wrists that told people that she was a slave.

Once the woman had Diana secured in the frame, she rotated it until Diana was looking up at the ceiling.&nbsp; Then she started pouring oil and rubbing it into Diana&#8217;s soft flesh.&nbsp; The woman was very thorough and took her time, caressing the oil into the skin and ensuring that every inch of her was covered.&nbsp; Diana lifted her head and looked across her nudity, seeing her body glistening in the light.

The frame was rotated and Diana was looking at the marbled floor now.&nbsp; The woman continued coating her and continued to be meticulous about her work.&nbsp; The oil was fragrant and she wondered what the aroma was.&nbsp; She knew that the Romans sometimes added herbs to the oil that would heighten the sexual response.&nbsp; That would be just great, thought Diana sarcastically.&nbsp; I&#8217;m already a nymphomaniac.&nbsp; The last thing in the world that I need is an aphrodisiac!!!

The frame was rotated another quarter turn and Diana was looking at the room upside down now with her legs in the air.&nbsp; The woman continued to work, making sure that the slave&#8217;s pussy and asshole were well lubricated, pushing fingers into Diana to spread the oil.

Once the woman was satisfied with her work, she knelt down and tightened the ropes, pulling her arms toward the frame.&nbsp; Then she rotated the frame again until Diana was upright and did the same thing, taking what little slack there was in the rope to her ankles out.&nbsp; This left Diana stretched as tight as a bow string.

&#8220;You are a pretty little thing,&#8221; the woman said as she ran her oil coated fingers down the side of Diana&#8217;s oil-coated breast.&nbsp; This was only the second time that the woman had spoken since she had claimed the girl.&nbsp; &#8220;And you look good enough to eat.&#8221;

With this, the woman leaned forward and sucked the right nipple into her mouth as her other hand claimed the other breast, letting the slippery flesh slide from her fingers.&nbsp; She pulled her head back with her teeth gripping the captive nipple and stretching Diana&#8217;s breast into a cone.&nbsp; Finally, she released it and Diana saw the woman&#8217;s lips coated with oil.

Others started to gather around the girl in the frame.&nbsp; Fingers stroked the glistening flesh as other fingers pinched and prodded.&nbsp; The woman knelt again and started stroking Diana&#8217;s petals with her fingers as she nodded to someone behind the stretched girl.

Diana immediately learned that the person behind her was a male as she felt a cock being placed between her bottom cheeks.&nbsp; She sucked in her breath as the tip of the cock pressed against her little pucker, increasing the pressure until it punched through.&nbsp; Diana exhaled in a gasp as the spear penetrated her body and she felt it continuing its descent into the depths of her bowels.

The woman continued to toy with the slick petals before her, occasionally gliding a finger into the girl&#8217;s juicy sex.&nbsp; Diana grunted once the cock fully impaled her ass and then moaned as it started a slow pumping motion.

The woman inserted a finger again and started a pumping motion of her own.&nbsp; Diana felt her body responding quickly and climaxed much faster than she would have expected.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t know if that was because of all of the erotic play leading up to her penetration or if it was because they had laced the oil with an aphrodisiac.&nbsp; Whatever the cause, it was the quickest orgasm that she ever had.

The cock kept plundering her ass and the woman kept busy at her sex.&nbsp; The second orgasm came just as quickly as the first.

Two fingers were pushed into her pussy and Diana was moaning non-stop by this point.&nbsp; She climaxed again when the woman&#8217;s third finger slid into her hot sex.

Lips claimed each of her nipples and she looked down, seeing a man and a woman suckling on her.&nbsp; The kneeling woman slid a fourth finger into her sex and she groaned as she dreaded where this scene was headed.&nbsp; But her groan was cut off in the middle, turning into a squeal, as the next orgasm wracked her overheated body.

Hands were now spanking her bottom cheeks each time the male withdrew his cock.&nbsp; The mouths at her breasts were now gnawing at her defenseless nipples.&nbsp; And the kneeling woman had tucked her thumb alongside her fingers and was pushing into Diana&#8217;s sex.

&#8220;Oh god!&#8221; groaned Diana.&nbsp; She had been fisted several times before during her captivity and it had always been uncomfortable.&nbsp; But she had never had so much additional stimulation at the same time.&nbsp; Her body was a swirl of sexual tension as she felt the pressure building at her sex.&nbsp; She clamped her eyes shut as she tried to focus her mind.

She felt her body wobble a bit and opened her eyes to see what was happening.&nbsp; A teenage boy had somehow gotten on top of the frame.&nbsp; He draped his body down from the top and his cock was poised in front of her lips.&nbsp; He started swinging his hips slightly and the cock started bumping into her lips.&nbsp; Obediently, she opened her mouth and the boy plunged his shaft into her.

Oh god, thought Diana.&nbsp; It seemed like every part of her was being used to stimulate her.&nbsp; Another orgasm tore through her stretched and captive body.

The fist finally forced its way into her sex.&nbsp; She groaned around the cock in her mouth as she felt the fingers exploring her vagina.&nbsp; The cock in her bottom kept pistoning and she felt the fingers inside of her pressing back at the invading cock.&nbsp; The lips kept sucking at her nipples, biting them and stretching them away from her.&nbsp; The hands kept spanking her bottom.&nbsp; Her head was spinning and she climaxed again.

But the crowd was relentless.&nbsp; They continued to torment her.&nbsp; The boy raised his legs and draped them over her shoulders.&nbsp; He was now plunging quickly into her mouth as he clung to the frame.

Other people wandered by and commented on her as if she was an artistic work or some other decorative item.

&#8220;We should get one of those for our villa,&#8221; said one woman.&nbsp; Diana didn&#8217;t know if she was talking about her or the frame.

&#8220;She is Celtic, I&#8217;m told,&#8221; said a male to someone else.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t see who he was talking about because of the crotch in front of her face.&nbsp; &#8220;I hear that they can take more than a fist in their pussies.&#8221;

The two at her breasts were stretching her nipples far away from her chest and she felt pain shooting through her body as the teeth clamped her nipples tightly.&nbsp; The hand inside of her poked around until it found her cervix, sending fresh pain through her body.&nbsp; The hands spanked her ass with more intensity, sending more pain through her tortured and tormented body.&nbsp; Someone had arrived with some sort of whip and that was being lashed against her belly.&nbsp; The cock in her mouth seemed to elongate and was now causing her to gag as it tried to force its way down her throat.

She erupted in a frenzy of emotions and sensations, screeching but hearing herself being muffled by the shaft between her lips.&nbsp; She tensed as the orgasm rushed through her body, feeling the stimulation continuing unrelentingly.

The orgasm reached a new crescendo and then she passed out.


To be continued










Chapter 7

When she woke up, she found that she was still in the frame and was still stretched tightly.&nbsp; There was no cock in her mouth.&nbsp; There was no cock in her ass.&nbsp; There was no hand in her sex.&nbsp; And nobody was spanking her ass or biting and stretching her nipples.

But she was still in the frame and she felt the strain of being stretched tightly.&nbsp; She felt a flash of pain on her left breast and then another one on her right.&nbsp; She opened her eyes and saw the two sisters holding candles over her chest and letting the wax slowly drip onto her breasts.

She raised her head and groaned at the sight that she saw.&nbsp; A lot of wax had already been dripped onto her and it seemed like the sisters were trying to encase her precious mounds in the stuff.

She heard Caesar&#8217;s voice.&nbsp; �Welcome back to the living, girl.�

She looked beyond her breasts and saw him standing between her spread thighs, his huge heavy cock pointing out threateningly from his groin.&nbsp; She trembled as she felt another splash of the wax on a breast and then responded.

�Thank you, my master,� Diana replied.

�I am told that people found you to be quite pleasing tonight, little one,� he said.&nbsp; He stepped forward a little and Livilla reached over, gripping his cock and guiding it to Diana&#8217;s sex.&nbsp; A stream of hot wax poured from her candle onto the vulnerable breast as Livilla moved, causing Diana to gasp.&nbsp; She gasped again as the huge cock slid into her pussy, filling her completely.

She whimpered as Agrippina dripped more wax onto her other breast.&nbsp; �Master, the wax is hot.&nbsp; It is hurting me.�

�We are almost finished, Caesar,� said Agrippina.&nbsp; �Just a few more spots.�

�Why do you want my breasts covered, Master?� Diana asked.&nbsp; �I thought that you liked to play with them.�

Caligula chuckled as he started moving his cock back out of her, only to thrust it back in.&nbsp; �I do like to play with them.&nbsp; And I like to play with this too.�&nbsp; He indicated what &#8216;this&#8217; was by flicking her clit with a fingertip.

�And this,� he said as he spanked a bottom cheek.

�And this,� he continued as he pushed a finger into her bottom, eliciting a squeal from the bound girl.

�And this.�&nbsp; He leaned forward and brushed a finger across her lips before sliding it into her mouth.

�And this.�&nbsp; He gave her belly a slap.&nbsp; �I like to play with every part of my precious pet.�&nbsp; She squealed again at the spank.

�Then why do you conceal my breasts?�

�I will answer that shortly,� he said.&nbsp; �But first, let us talk.&nbsp; I am told that you are a goddess.�

Diana took a deep breath.&nbsp; This was an important moment for her.&nbsp; It was the moment that might raise her out of slavery.&nbsp; �Yes, my Master.&nbsp; I am Diana.�

�Why have you never told me that, girl?� he asked her as his cock sliced in and out of her taut body.

�I did tell you that, Master,� she said.&nbsp; �I told you that on the night that you bought me.�

He furrowed his brow and she could tell that he was thinking.&nbsp; �I thought that those were just the rantings of a silly slave girl who simply wanted to be released.�

�No, my Master,� she said to him.&nbsp; �I am truly Diana.�

�If you are a goddess, then how did you become my slave?�

�I became your slave because you bought me, Master.�

�How could you be bought if you are a goddess?�

�Any god or goddess can be enslaved when they return to the earth and assume a mortal&#8217;s form,� she answered, thinking as quickly as she could.&nbsp; Honestly, she did not know if that was true or not.&nbsp; But it was time to start spinning tales.&nbsp; �I woke up after entering my mortal form and was immediately captured.&nbsp; Then I was sold and you bought me, Master.�

�I see,� he said but the expression on his face indicted that he clearly did not.

�How do I know that you are Diana, girl?� he asked her.

�Your sisters can tell you of my prowess with a bow,� she said and she saw both sisters nodding in agreement.&nbsp; �Only the goddess of the hunt can do what I do.�&nbsp; There was more nodding.

�Or I can show you myself, Master,� she continued.

�And surely you have noticed what I have done with your gardens and your crops,� she went on.&nbsp; �Only the goddess of fertility could turn your soil so fertile.�

�Yes, yes,� he said giving her a dismissive wave.&nbsp; �I have known all along that you truly were a goddess.�

The sisters continued to drop the wax onto her breasts but she did not feel the heat at this point.&nbsp; All of the flesh of her firm mounds was coated so that now the extra wax simply made the coating thicker.

It felt strange to Diana.&nbsp; She felt as if her breasts were being constricted.&nbsp; Maybe the wax shrank as it cooled.&nbsp; Whatever the cause, it was distracting to her.

�Master, the wax is uncomfortable,� she complained.

�Hush, girl,� he said.&nbsp; �It is necessary.&nbsp; The royal sculptor has requested it.�

Diana blinked.&nbsp; The royal sculptor?&nbsp; Why would the royal sculptor want to have hot wax poured onto her breasts?

�I don&#8217;t understand, my Master.�

�You will see, little one,� he said as he continued to piston in and out of her with his massive shaft.&nbsp; �I am also a god.�

Diana blinked again.&nbsp; She remembered how Caligula had declared himself to be a god.&nbsp; He even had the heads removed from a number of statues of gods and had his own head placed on top of them.

�I did not know, Master,� she replied.&nbsp; �When did this happen?�

�I have always been a god,� he declared as he watched his thick manhood disappearing into her tightly stretched body.&nbsp; �But I informed the world of it tonight.&nbsp; The word will spread quickly throughout the empire now.�

�I did not know, my Master,� she repeated.&nbsp; �But I still don&#8217;t understand why the royal sculptor would want to have my breasts punished.�

�I have decided that, as a god, I should have a goddess as my wife,� he continued.&nbsp; �My sisters are making a mold of my wife&#8217;s breasts to help the royal sculptor make a statue of her.�

Diana opened her eyes wide in surprise.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t sure what she was hearing.&nbsp; Now she was really confused.&nbsp; But the confusion went away after Livilla and Agrippina each leaned down and kissed her on the lips.

�Congratulations, Diana,� said Agrippina.&nbsp; �Now you will be our sister.�

The confusion might have left her as the meaning of Caligula&#8217;s words sank in.&nbsp; But the surprise did not.&nbsp; No, it wasn&#8217;t surprise.&nbsp; It was more like shock.

�I will take you as my wife,� he announced as he tensed and filled her sex with his hot seed.

�Ohmigod!!!� wailed Diana as her own body was wracked with another powerful orgasm.

�Celtic again,� smiled Livilla knowingly at her sister as Diana let out the strange words.

�Wow!� thought Diana as she regained her senses.&nbsp; She certainly had elevated her station in life!&nbsp; She had only been trying to get released from slavery.&nbsp; She had never dreamed that she might become an empress.

The next month was a whirlwind of activities as the wedding was planned.&nbsp; The first change to occur was the removal of her golden cuffs.&nbsp; She would continue to wear the collar as a mark of her exclusivity to the emperor.&nbsp; But an empress would not need cuffs.

She was given clothing to wear.&nbsp; And it was beautiful clothing that was elegantly stitched and embroidered.&nbsp; She still went naked when she helped in the gardens.&nbsp; After all, they had all seen her body before.&nbsp; Plus, she did not want to soil her fine clothes.

And she was naked for the many sittings before the royal sculptor while he worked on the two statues he was making of her.&nbsp; That was pure agony as she had to remain as motionless as possible.&nbsp; She always seemed to develop an itch somewhere on her body that would cause her to eventually move, only to be scolded by the sculptor.&nbsp; Then he would step forward and reposition her correctly so that he could continue his work.

And she was still naked at the orgies which continued to be held almost every night.&nbsp; But the rest of the time, she wore her elegant clothing around the palace and around town.

Finally, it was the eve of their wedding day.&nbsp; She was naked and was sitting in a throne beside Caligula&#8217;s throne.&nbsp; Agrippina was kneeling beside her throne and Diana was holding one of the full, lush breasts in her hand, enjoying the heaviness of it.&nbsp; Livilla was kneeling on the other side of Caligula&#8217;s throne.

It was a smaller group than normal with only twenty other people in attendance.&nbsp; But she was happy that it was such an intimate gathering when Caligula made his announcement.

�Behold the goddess Diana,� he started as he pointed down at her nudity kneeling before him.&nbsp; �Tomorrow, this goddess becomes my bride.�&nbsp; Diana could hear pride in his voice and that made her feel proud as well.&nbsp; �Tonight, she is yours to enjoy.�

Diana gasped at the news and glanced around the large room.&nbsp; A larger group would have done permanent damage to her at an event such as this.&nbsp; Even a group as small as this one was going to be a challenge.&nbsp; She knew that she would be exhausted by the end of the evening.

Throughout the evening, she was fucked.&nbsp; She was sodomized.&nbsp; She was fucked and sodomized at the same time.&nbsp; She was fisted.&nbsp; And she had no idea how many blowjobs she had given or pussies she had eaten.&nbsp; She was sure, though, that many had come back for seconds during the party because there was no point during the evening that she was idle.&nbsp; She was always involved and active in some lewd and decadent way.

Caligula entertained himself with his two sisters again .&nbsp; Diana watched them when she could but was too busy most of the time to be able to see them.&nbsp; She knew that she should be upset that her new husband had other lovers.&nbsp; But with her two new sisters, it somehow just seemed right.&nbsp; They were family, after all.

Plus, this was ancient Rome.&nbsp; Having extra lovers was what they did.&nbsp; No, she could never allow herself to become jealous.

She was exhausted when the orgy finally ended in the wee hours of the morning.&nbsp; The sisters took her to bed with them and tried to make love with her but she was spent.&nbsp; She fell into a deep sleep and did not awaken until the next day when it was time to prepare for the wedding.

The wedding itself was wonderful.&nbsp; She had never attended a Roman wedding so she had no idea what to expect.&nbsp; But it was thrilling to her.&nbsp; It was a festive event that was full of entertainment and laced with ceremony.

Her gown was beautiful also, what little of it there was.&nbsp; It was a scoop neck full length gown with gold and gemstone highlights.&nbsp; It was something like what she might see an actress wear to the Oscars, although the neckline for the Oscars would have been much more modest.&nbsp; Her neckline scooped so low that her entire chest was on display for all of the revelers to admire.&nbsp; She was surprised at her outfit, but not embarrassed.&nbsp; She had spent so much time naked in the past months that merely showing off her breasts seemed almost tame.

She was not even embarrassed by how the ceremony ended, although she knew that she should be.&nbsp; After the priests had declared them to be husband and wife, Caligula consummated the marriage.&nbsp; He lay Diana on the stone altar at the front of the temple and then mounted her, fucking her in the presence of all of the wedding-goers.&nbsp; He spewed his seed into her and then she licked his organ clean and they stood and took a bow to the cheering of the congregation.

She knew that she should be embarrassed, but she wasn&#8217;t.&nbsp; She supposed that all of the orgies had numbed her sense of modesty and morality.

The orgy followed and, once again, she was the belle of the ball.&nbsp; Cocks pounded into her as she licked pussies and sucked on cocks and balls.&nbsp; She was an animated ball of sexual energy and she thrilled at all of the erotic delights.

And then it happened.&nbsp; She was bound into a frame with her legs spread wide and in the air and her head dangling downward.&nbsp; But something malfunctioned.&nbsp; The frame fell apart and she crashed downward, crumpling to the marble floor, unconscious.


Chapter 8

Diana opened her eyes slowly and was assaulted by bright lights that caused her head to throb.&nbsp; Everything was out of focus but she could see the blurry outline of a head framed with long dark hair.

�Agrippina?&nbsp; Livilla?&nbsp; What happened?� she asked in Latin.

�Oh, Diana!&nbsp; You&#8217;re awake!� the head replied in English.

�Who are you?� asked Diana, still speaking Latin.&nbsp; She was very confused now and her head hurt.&nbsp; �Where am I?�

�Diana, what are you saying?� the head said, still using English.&nbsp; Diana felt a palm pressed against her forehead.&nbsp; �How do you feel?�

Finally, Diana switched back to her native tongue.&nbsp; �My head hurts,� she responded in English.

�It should hurt after what Brandi did to you,� said the head.

�Agrippina, is that you?� asked Diana.&nbsp; �What is brandy?�

�It&#8217;s me, Di,� the head said, responding to the first question.&nbsp; Slowly, it was coming into focus.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s Heather.�

At last, Diana could see.&nbsp; She saw the beautiful Heather leaning over her, just inches above her face.&nbsp; Diana turned her head and looked around, �Where am I?�

�You are in the hospital,� said Heather.

�But what am I doing here?�

�Oh, that&#8217;s right.&nbsp; You wouldn&#8217;t know,� was Heather&#8217;s reply.&nbsp; �She hit you from behind.&nbsp; You never would have seen it coming.&nbsp; But don&#8217;t worry.&nbsp; Brandi got kicked off the team.�

�Brandy?� asked Diana, confused.

Heather reached out again and placed her hand on Diana&#8217;s breast, squeezing it gently.&nbsp; �You remember Brandi� the one who called you Big Tits.�

�Oh yeah, I think so,� murmured Diana as her eyelids slowly closed.&nbsp; �Mmmm, that feels good.&nbsp; Keep doing it.�

Heather opened her eyes wide in surprise and pulled her hand back quickly.&nbsp; She had not even realized that she had touched her teammate so intimately.&nbsp; Diana was as straight as anyone she had ever met.&nbsp; She liked being touched like that?

Heather slowly stretched her arm out again and placed her palm over the firm mound that was under the hospital gown.&nbsp; �Really, Di?�

�Mmmm, yes,� whispered Diana.&nbsp; �It feels so good.�

Heather gave the breast another tentative squeeze.&nbsp; Despite professing to be an accounting eunuch, Heather was bisexual and loved coupling with either sex, although she genuinely preferred female partners.&nbsp; She had longed for Diana for three years but always viewed her as unapproachable.&nbsp; Now she was being invited to squeeze her captain&#8217;s breast!

She held it for long moments before starting to squeeze it again.&nbsp; It felt every bit as wonderful as she imagined.&nbsp; She heard Diana cooing in her sleep as she palpated the generous mound and then became more adventurous.&nbsp; She squeezed it a bit harder and then heard Diana talking in her sleep.

�The nipple,� murmured Diana.

Heather moved her fingers to the nipple, which she could clearly see tenting out the material of her hospital gown.&nbsp; Fingers circled it, causing the little bud to stiffen even more.&nbsp; Heather lightly gripped the little nubbin and rolled it back and forth.

�Mmmm,� cooed Diana.&nbsp; �Nice.�

�Yes,� whispered Heather as she continued to toy with the nipple.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s very nice.�

Diana was kept one more night for observation and then was discharged from the hospital.

�Oh, I thought I lost these,� said Diana as she picked up the clothes that she had been wearing at practice.&nbsp; The hospital had laundered them and folded them neatly.&nbsp; She held up each piece before putting it on.&nbsp; �Hmmm, they aren&#8217;t even torn.�

�Why would they be torn?� asked Heather as she was enjoying the view of her naked team captain as she inspected her garments.&nbsp; Heather had caught glimpses of Diana&#8217;s body in the locker room in the past but had never gotten to view her very well.&nbsp; She knew that Diana was beautiful but hadn&#8217;t realized how spectacular her body was.&nbsp; �You were clobbered over the head; not attacked by wolves.�

�I&#8217;m just surprised that they&#8217;re intact,� said Diana as she buttoned on the skirt.&nbsp; Now she was standing topless and Heather&#8217;s heart was racing at the sight of the beautiful, succulent breasts that were still exposed.&nbsp; �I thought they tore them.�

Heather crinkled her nose as she thought.&nbsp; What was Diana talking about?&nbsp; �Who is they?� she asked.

�Claudius and Octavius,� answered Diana as she leaned forward to position her breasts correctly in the cups of the bra.

�Who are Claudius and Octavius?� asked Heather, truly confused now.&nbsp; She had never even heard of the pair.

�Just a couple of guys I met on my trip,� Diana replied.&nbsp; Heather sighed as the wondrous orbs were concealed from her sight.

�What trip?� asked Heather.&nbsp; �Where did you go?�

�To Rome,� said Diana as she stood up after tying her sneakers onto her feet.&nbsp; �And then to Capri.�

�When did you go to Rome?�&nbsp; Now Heather was really confused.&nbsp; She had never mentioned a trip to Rome.&nbsp; She could imagine that Diana would dream of those places, given her major.&nbsp; She wondered where accounting majors would go in their dreams.&nbsp; Davos, maybe?&nbsp; Wall Street?

�What did you do in Rome?�

�A little bit of everything.&nbsp; And a lot of sex,� was Diana&#8217;s response.&nbsp; This brought a blush to the cheeks of both girls.&nbsp; �Lots and lots of sex.&nbsp; Oh, and I became the empress there too.�

Heather drove Diana home and stayed for lunch.&nbsp; The first thing that Diana did when she got to her apartment was to get on the internet.&nbsp; She did a web search on Caligula and gasped at what she saw in the listings that she found.

�Gaius (Caligula) is believed to have had five wives, although there continues to be confusion and controversy over the fourth one,� the online encyclopedia said.&nbsp; It listed the first three wives and described how each of them died:&nbsp; poisoning, hanging and childbirth.&nbsp; Then it had this entry:

�Near the end of his reign, Gaius declared himself to be a god.&nbsp; One month later, he was married again.&nbsp; It is said that he wedded the goddess Diana.�

There was a link to Diana and she clicked it.&nbsp; She gasped again at what she saw when the next page filled the screen.&nbsp; There were pictures of two statues of the goddess:&nbsp; one marble and the other one bronze.&nbsp; The goddess was naked and it was easy to see that she had been the model for the statues.&nbsp; These were the two statues that the royal sculptor had been working on while she posed for him.

�Come here, Heather,� she called out.&nbsp; �Look at this.�

Heather ran into the room and leaned over Diana&#8217;s shoulder, looking at the computer screen.&nbsp; �What about it?&nbsp; Some old statues.�

�But look closer,� said Diana.&nbsp; �Do you recognize her?�

Heather did lean in a little more and Diana recognized the moment that it dawned on Heather what she was looking at.&nbsp; �Ohmigod, Di!!!&nbsp; It&#8217;s you!!!�

�Yep, it sure looks like me,� nodded Diana.

�Nice tits!� exclaimed Heather.

Diana laughed.&nbsp; �Thanks.&nbsp; You should have seen them making the mold.&nbsp; That was sure different.�

�Wait!� exclaimed Heather.&nbsp; �Are you saying that really is you?�

�Well, it&#8217;s not me,� said Diana.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s just a statue.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s a sculpture of me.�&nbsp; She went on to tell Heather about her adventure; or her dream.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t sure how to think about it at this point.

She described how she had been captured and how she was convinced that she was in a mental institution.&nbsp; She told of how she was sold and then bought by the emperor.&nbsp; And she talked about the many months of her slavery and how it ended when she married Caesar and became the Empress of the Roman Empire.

�Wait!� said Heather at one point.&nbsp; �They really had orgies?�&nbsp; Diana had told her about the frequent orgies but she left out most of the details.

�Oh yeah; big time,� nodded Diana.&nbsp; �They definitely liked their sex and the more perverted it was, the better.�

�I wish I could have been there,� sighed Heather.&nbsp; �Sounds like fun.�

Diana turned her head and kissed Heather&#8217;s cheek.&nbsp; �Thanks.&nbsp; I wish you had been there too.&nbsp; But you told me that you were asexual.&nbsp; You called yourself an accounting eunuch.&nbsp; You would have been pretty uncomfortable there.&nbsp; The orgies were pretty lewd.�

Heather wrapped her arms around Diana and squeezed her before cupping her bra-encased breasts and holding them.&nbsp; �Trust me.&nbsp; I would not have been uncomfortable at an orgy with you.�

Diana thought for a moment before acting.&nbsp; She was surprised by Heather&#8217;s behavior and words.&nbsp; But she also now had a huge sexual neediness.&nbsp; She stood up and turned, wrapping her arms around her teammate and pressing her lips to hers.&nbsp; �So you think that you would like to orgy with me, do you?�

�Mmmm,� murmured Heather into her captain&#8217;s lips.&nbsp; �I do, I do.�

�Ha!� said Diana.&nbsp; �We&#8217;ll see about that!�&nbsp; She reached up and started unbuttoning Heather&#8217;s blouse.&nbsp; Once it was open, she pushed it off her shoulders, letting it flutter to the floor.&nbsp; She paused to see how Heather reacted but the junior just reinitiated the kiss from earlier.

Diana continued until she had her auburn-haired teammate standing naked in her apartment.&nbsp; She lowered herself to her knees and reached out, letting her fingers glide down Heather&#8217;s bald mound.&nbsp; �I love this look.�

Heather blushed.&nbsp; �Thanks.&nbsp; It makes me feel sexy.�

Diana leaned forward and kissed the mound.&nbsp; �You are definitely sexy, love.�&nbsp; She then trailed her fingers lower, letting them glide over Heather&#8217;s petals which were already slick with arousal.

The two of them never left the apartment for the rest of the day.&nbsp; They made love and Heather was amazed at the way her previously straight teammate devoured her hungrily, using her tongue and fingers to raise her to orgasm after orgasm.

�You are amazing, Di!� observed Heather as they cuddled together after countless orgasms.&nbsp; They spooned with Heather lying in front as Diana held her breast in her palm.

�I&#8217;m supposed to be amazing,� replied Diana as she gave the soft, plump orb a squeeze.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m a goddess; and an empress to boot!�

Heather laughed and flipped around until she was facing Diana.&nbsp; She leaned forward and kissed her captain as her hand traveled up Diana&#8217;s thigh and then rested on her hip.&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t say that too often or you might find yourself in that mental institution that you dreamed about.&nbsp; But I agree.&nbsp; You truly are a goddess.�

Diana kissed Heather on her lips as her hand moved up and covered her teammate&#8217;s right breast.&nbsp; �Before all of this happened, I can&#8217;t imagine that I would do anything like this.�

�Like what?� asked Heather as she moved her hand and squeezed Diana&#8217;s rump.

�Like this,� repeated Diana as she gave the breast in her hand another squeeze.&nbsp; �Like making love to you.�

Heather giggled and gave Diana&#8217;s bottom a spank.&nbsp; �You aren&#8217;t making love to me.&nbsp; I&#8217;m making love to you.&nbsp; I&#8217;m worshipping a goddess.�

�Well, it wouldn&#8217;t have happened,� repeated Diana.&nbsp; �How long was I out?�

�About three days,� said Heather as her hand roamed all over Diana&#8217;s bottom cheeks.&nbsp; �We were very worried about you.�

Diana nodded again.&nbsp; �Yeah, I was pretty worried about me at times too.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not easy to get used to being a slave.�

�Ooooo!!!� cooed Heather.&nbsp; �So does that mean that you&#8217;re used to it now?&nbsp; Maybe you could be my slave.�

�Ha!� chuckled Diana.&nbsp; �Yeah, I got used to it.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m a goddess now.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t be a slave.�

Heather stuck out her lower lip in a pout.&nbsp; �Goddesses can&#8217;t be slaves?�

�It&#8217;s not polite to enslave a goddess,� Diana answered and kissed Heather again, giving one of her nipples a tweak for good measure.

�But you said that Caligula enslaved a goddess,� Heather gasped at the surprise pinch.

�He didn&#8217;t know I was a goddess when he bought me,� explained Diana.&nbsp; �And as soon as he found out, he married me.�

�That&#8217;s amazing,� gushed Heather.&nbsp; �I still can&#8217;t believe that you were the Empress of the whole Roman Empire!&nbsp; Does that make you a Caesarette?�

Diana laughed and pulled her lover closer.&nbsp; �It made me well fucked.&nbsp; I need it now.&nbsp; Lots of it.�

�Oooooo!!!!� squealed Heather excitedly.&nbsp; �Well, I got lots to give.�&nbsp; She pushed on Diana&#8217;s shoulder, rolling her onto her back and then dove between her thighs.&nbsp; Heather was busy slurping away by the time Diana even knew what was happening.&nbsp; But it was not like she would have protested or resisted even if she did know.&nbsp; She just propped her head up with a pillow and watched her beautiful friend feasting on her needy pussy.

�I would love to do my doctoral thesis on what I learned while I was away,� said Diana after she recovered from her first orgasm.&nbsp; �But I don&#8217;t think that my firsthand knowledge would be very well accepted in the citations.�

�You were there, love,� said Heather as she stroked her tongue up between Diana&#8217;s petals again.&nbsp; �Nobody alive knows more than you do.�

�I want to go back,� said Diana.&nbsp; �I want to go back to Italy.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go together this summer.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll show you where I was sold and we can go to the palace where I was held, if it&#8217;s still there.�

�I want you to show me one of the orgies,� said Heather, and then she plunged her tongue into Diana&#8217;s sex.&nbsp; �I want to spend a night on an orgy barge.�

Diana sucked in her breath as the tongue stabbed into her, feeling the familiar waves of arousal washing through her body.&nbsp; �I doubt that they do that anymore, love.&nbsp; It&#8217;s such a shame.�

�Yeah,� said Heather as she flicked her tongue over Diana&#8217;s clit.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s a real shame.�


The end
