Synopsis:   Ellen has secret needs which her husband can\'t or won\'t satisfy. Lilah is a different story, but she can\'t help the fact that her husband can make her climax on command.







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE LONG SLOW ONE

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Now, Lilah," Jonas said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No," Lilah said. "No, Jonas. I won't. No."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jonas only smiled. "Of course you will, darling," he said. "You've already started."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lilah shook her head stubbornly, but her eyes told him she knew he was right. She was a strikingly pretty woman in her early thirties, with dark shoulder-length hair and a curvy figure.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"This is going to be a treat," Jonas said to the other two people at the table. They were Paul and Ellen Lastner, a couple in their mid-twenties. Jonas and Lilah had known them only a short while, and this was the first time they had been invited to their home. "I explained to Lilah on the way over here how I wanted it to be. A long, slow one. Starting very gradually, and building slowly. Taking its time. Getting more and more intense, more and more overwhelming. Uncontrollable. Well, it's always uncontrollable of course, but even more so this time. Building and building. On and on. Taking her to heights--well, I can't say where she's never been before, but where her mind had never thought she could go--especially under these conditions. And when it finally happens--just explosive. Crazy, screaming, over the top insanity. It should be a magnificent spectacle. And it's the least we can do to show our appreciation for this superb dinner we have just enjoyed."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen's eyes were wide. She was taller than Lilah, with a slender yet sensuous body and short blonde hair. She was watching the other woman, who was still reflexively shaking her head in denial of what her husband was saying, and of what was happening to her. But she was breathing deeply, and a little rapidly, and there was the faintest catch in her throat with every inhalation. "But--but can you--" Ellen stammered, her own breath somewhat unsteady. "Can you really make her--make her do that--even if she doesn't want to?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Watch," Jonas said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He knew Paul would have told her, after his conversation with him a few days ago, in which he had confided to his new friend the special power he had over his wife, and had promised to demonstrate it for him--for both of them--at the earliest opportunity. For how else is power to be enjoyed other than by demonstrating it? And this particular power was most intensely enjoyed in front of an audience, when Lilah's reluctance was most in evidence, her futile resistance strongest, her inevitable defeat most sweet. There were other reasons, of course--reasons having to do with Paul's most attractive and sensuous-looking wife--but that was for the future. For now there was the spectacle.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lilah had stopped shaking her head and had closed her eyes, sitting very still now, her hands clutching each other as they rested on the table, apparently trying to concentrate on controlling herself. But her breathing was deeper than before, and her firm round breasts rose and fell noticeably under the green silk blouse she was wearing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Jason," Lilah said. It was a plea, but a hopeless one, and they both knew it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, darling?" Jason said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Please," Lilah said, in spite of herself.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It's too late, darling," Jason said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Damn you," Lilah said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jason said nothing to that. For a couple of minutes there was silence, while Paul, Ellen and Jonas watched Lilah struggling with herself. She continued sitting as still as possible, but soon the sound of her breathing could be heard, faintly at first, then more loudly and quickly, sounding almost like the panting of a dog.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Ah," Jonas said finally. "Her nipples are hard now. You can see the shapes of them poking out her blouse. Even through her brassiere."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lilah looked like she was going to say something, but didn't. Her eyes still closed, she pressed her lips together tightly, but continued to pant audibly through her nose. She also began to squirm slightly in her chair.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Jesus," Paul said then. His voice was slightly hoarse. "You--you said you told her to--you said a--a long slow one. If you--will she--I mean, if you say a short fast one, will she--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh yes," Jason said. "I always tell her just how I want it beforehand. Usually, anyway. And yes, that's what she does. If I tell her quick and fast, she comes instantly when I give the word. Bam! If I say hard, she comes hard. If I say soft and easy, you'd hardly know she was coming if you weren't looking at her. But she does it. Every time."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But how--" Paul said. But he stopped at the sound of a moan from Lilah. It was a short, stifled moan, little more than a whimper, but it got their attention instantly. It was followed by another sound, longer this time. Lilah's hands unclasped themselves and clutched at the edge of the table, clutched so tightly that her fingers turned white. But after a moment she let go of the table and crossed her arms in front of her, hugging herself intensely as though to hold herself in. She began to rock back and forth, slowly at first, then a little faster. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No," she choked out. "No. Oh god...Oh god no..." Her mouth was open now, open and panting hard. Soon her head fell back and her eyes closed. Her arms dropped, her hands gripping the sides of her chair. Her breasts were rising and falling rapidly now with her agitated breathing, and the nipples were indeed pushing out stiffly against the front of her blouse. Her body twisted in the chair, her legs moving restlessly, her skirt creeping up over her bare thighs. "Oh Christ!" she cried out. "Oh Christ, Jason, damn you, oh damn you! I can't...ohhh...unnhhh...' She was writhing so hard now that she was in danger of falling out of her chair. Her hands clutched frantically at the seat as if to keep her from doing so, but it was no use; after a minute she slid out of the chair and went to her knees on the floor. From there she fell forward onto all fours, and then collapsed onto her stomach. She immediately rolled over onto her back and then began to rock from side to side, moaning loudly. Her legs thrashed, her skirt now riding up nearly to her crotch. Then she caught her breath sharply and began to make little grunting sounds, interspersed with mewling whimpers. These soon turned into cries as her body gave a series of small spasms. Her hands turned into fists and began to beat a tattoo against the floor as she bucked and twisted helplessly. Her body arched tautly, straining upwards as if to an unseen lover. Then she began to scream. Her hands went to her breasts, squeezing them over and over as she thrust herself frenziedly up and down. Her screams became louder and more shrill, rising to an ear-splitting peak as her body convulsed wildly, rolling on the floor and spasming uncontrollably again and again, bucking, flailing, kicking. It went on and on, her screams echoing through the room, and only gradually diminished, the volume of her shrieks subsiding finally as the convulsions slowly died away, until at last there was no sound in the room except for Lilah's harsh, exhausted panting. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Damn, that was hot!" Paul said. The two men were sipping drinks in the living room while the women were upstairs, Ellen helping Lilah clean up. "I can't believe you can make her do that any time you want to." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Why not?" Jason said. "Didn't I just prove it?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Jesus. I never saw anything like it! I hope you don't mind my telling you I've got a hard-on like you wouldn't believe."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I don't mind," Jason said. "I'd be surprised if you didn't."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And you--you don't mind having people watch as you--as she--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Having people watch is part of the fun."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But she--Lilah--she doesn't seem to like it much."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No. That's part of the fun too. Don't you think?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I--well, I--I don't--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Sure you do," Jason said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a pause. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But it's not--" Paul said then. "I mean, you don't just--you don't just do it for that, right? For other people, I mean. You--you do it when you two are alone--when you're--you know. . ."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"When we're fucking? Damn right. All the time."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Jesus," Paul said. Then he said, "It must be...it must be something."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh, it is," Jason said, smiling. "It's awesome."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I bet." Paul took a sip of his drink. "I envy you, man."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Do you?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well sure, I mean...being able to...to have that...to have her do that...while you're...I mean, whenever..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Is it just that?" Jason said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Why you envy me. Is it just because I can make her come on command? Or is it Lilah herself? You find her attractive, do you?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, I--well, sure. Yes--I mean, sure, she's a very pretty woman, and she's--I mean..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"She's hot, right?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, yeah."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And you'd like to fuck her yourself, even if it wasn't for the other business, right?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hey, Jason, look, man, I'm not...I mean, we're not talking about--I mean..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What are we talking about, Paul?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"We're talking about how you can--what it must be like...for you, I mean...to have her...to make her..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"To be on top of her, and inside her, with her body against mine, while I have her do what you just saw. Right, Paul?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Jesus," Paul said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Or more quickly, or more quietly, or more explosively, or less, or any way I please. Whenever I please. Whether she wants to or not. My beautiful sexy wife. Right?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Christ," Paul said. "Yes. Damn."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I could let you borrow her," Jason said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul stared at him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What?" Paul said finally.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'd have to be there, of course. If you want the full experience, I mean. Lilah will only respond that way to me. To my commands, that is. Of course if you just wanted to fuck her that wouldn't be necessary, but obviously what you want is--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You're not serious," Paul said. His voice sounded strange.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yeah, I am."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But--but why?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jason shrugged. "I like to do favors for friends. And also, I enjoy it. Watching her. Like tonight, only under different circumstances."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But--but what does--how does Lilah--why would she--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"She can't help it, Paul. You saw that just now."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I--well, yes, I saw you could--you could make her come, but I mean, with--to be with a man, another man, why would she consent to that?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Do you care if it's consensual, Paul?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul was very still, staring at Jason for several moments. Then, slowly, he picked up his glass and drank from it again. "Yes, I do," he said then. He put the glass down. "I'm not a rapist, for god's sake, Jason. I don't force myself on women. I couldn't--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"There's no force involved," Jason said calmly. "Did you see me use any force this evening? Did that look like rape to you? Lilah did it all on her own."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, but she obviously didn't want to," Paul said. "She even said that. She begged you not to make her do it, but you did. Somehow. And--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And you enjoyed the hell out of it. And you can't tell me that the fact that she was unwilling, but that she still couldn't control herself, wasn't a big part of what turned you on. And if you're fucking her you'll enjoy it even more." Jason paused. Paul said nothing. "But you know what, Paul, it's up to you," Jason went on. "If you're really not interested, hey, that's fine. I just thought--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I--" Paul said, and stopped. He swallowed. "I'm--I'm not saying I'm not--I mean--Jesus. I mean, who the hell wouldn't be? If I--if we could...you know...if it wouldn't be..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"If it wouldn't be what?" Jason said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well...you know...if nobody would find out..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You mean Ellen."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well...primarily...but I mean..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Don't worry," Jason said. "We can be as discreet as you want." He poured himself another drink. "And speaking of Ellen..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What?" Paul said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, you know, Paul, Ellen is a very attractive lady too. And I'm just thinking about a little reciprocity here."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul's eyes went wide. His mouth opened, and then closed. For a moment he couldn't speak.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Ellen?" he said finally. "You--you want to--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I do," Jason said. "Don't you think that's fair?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul gave a sudden strange-sounding laugh. "You've got to be kidding," he said. "Ellen would never go for that. She's not--she's just--I mean, there's no way. Even if I--well..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jason shrugged. "You never know," he said. "She might surprise you."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul shook his head. "That's crazy," he said. "Anyway, Ellen--I mean, she's not like Lilah, you know? She doesn't--she's not all that...well...orgasmic. I mean, she's--she's sexy and all, but she--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You mean she doesn't come?" Jason said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, no, she does...sometimes...but it's not...I mean...not like that, Jesus. She's--you know, she's kind of...contained. She doesn't let herself go a lot. And anyway, she wouldn't, I mean she's not...promiscuous or anything. So I don't think..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Tell you what," Jason said. "Why don't you let me give it a try. Okay?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You mean..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I mean you get to do it with Lilah, and I'll make her come as much as you want--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Jesus Christ!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And I get to try and seduce your wife--and probably not succeed. That's a pretty good bargain, don't you think?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul closed his eyes and shook his head slowly. "Wait a minute, wait a minute. If you want to seduce my wife, why ask me? I can't, you know, I can't make her--do anything. And if you, like, made a pass at her or something I couldn't stop you, right? I mean, I wouldn't even know about it probably. So why do you need to ask me? Let alone try to make a...a bargain, as you say...with Lilah. I don't get it."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"First of all," Jason said, "As far as you being with Lilah is concerned, the bargain thing was just an afterthought. Ellen or no Ellen, you got that if you want it. As I say, I expect to enjoy it too. And secondly, I don't like to sneak around, okay? I like things to be open and straightforward. If I got to sleep with Ellen, I wouldn't want to have to be all furtive and secretive about it. I'd want you to know. Just as--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh." Paul said. He was looking at Jason now, looking intently. "Oh, yeah, I think I get it. You'd want me to know you were fucking my wife. It would give you a sense of power, right? Like with Lilah. Making her come, making her do it with me. It's what you said, the fact that she doesn't want to do it is part of the fun. Yeah, so if Ellen went for it you'd get to fuck her, and fuck me at the same time, only in a different way. Power."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jason shrugged. "Sure," he said. "We all get our kicks in our own way, don't we?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul was silent again for a long time. Then he said, "You won't get anywhere with Ellen. She's just not the type."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Then you have nothing to worry about," Jason said. "You want me to set it up with Lilah?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Sure," Paul said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I want you to fuck Paul," Jason said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Damn," Lilah said. "I knew that was coming. You want that Ellen bitch, right?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes," Jason said. "But I think I can have that Ellen bitch any time I want her. I just want to watch you fuck him."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I don't want to," Lilah said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I don't care," Jason said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You rotten son of a bitch," Lilah said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Come now," Jason said. "Hard."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No," Lilah said. "Ohh. Ohh ahh. Ohh shit...no unnhhh...oh damn you...aaahhhh...Christ....AAAAIIIIEEEEE!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Good girl," Jason said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was not really a coincidence when Jason ran into Ellen as she was coming out of the supermarket a few days later, but Ellen didn't know that. She was toting several heavy bags, and Jason naturally helped her carry them to her car. He explained that his own car was in the shop, and Ellen naturally offered to give him a ride home. Her house was closer than his, and he suggested they stop there so he could help her carry the groceries in. Once they were inside she naturally asked him if he would like to have a drink. Naturally he accepted.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They had talked about general topics in the car, neither of them mentioning what had happened at Ellen and Paul's house the other night. But of course it couldn't be avoided for long. Ellen brought it up as she was making the drinks in the kitchen.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That was...that was quite a performance the other night," she said, not looking at him as she pulled some bottles out of a cabinet.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Did you enjoy it?" Jason asked. "I figured Paul would, but I didn't really know about you. But Paul said it would be all right, so..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, yes, it was...well, it was certainly...unusual."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Did it turn you on?" Jason said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was half turned away from him, but he thought she blushed a little. She didn't answer right away; then after a pause she said, "Well, it definitely turned Paul on, I can tell you that."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jason smiled. "Gave you an amorous night, did he?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She blushed again, but again she didn't answer. "How do you do it? Is it some kind of hypnosis? I guess it must be. Post-hypnotic suggestion, isn't that what they call it?" When Jason said nothing, she went on. "But she seemed, Lilah, she seemed so...well, reluctant, and they say you can't hypnotize a person into doing something they really don't want to do. Isn't that right? Or is that just a theory?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jason shrugged, although she wasn't looking at him. "I don't really know much about hypnosis as such. I've never hypnotized Lilah. But I guess it's something like that. It's like there's a switch inside her that I can turn on whenever I want."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But can--can anyone do that to her? Turn on the switch like that?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No. No, I've experimented in that area, actually--somewhat against my better judgment. Once or twice I've tried to impart the secret to other guys, but it doesn't work. It's just me who has the power, and that's how it is."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But--but if she doesn't want you to--like the other night--if she doesn't like what you do with her, why does she stay with you?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Ah," Jason said. "You'd have to ask Lilah that."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a pause. Ellen was at the sink now, adding water to the drinks she had poured out. "And can you--do you have this power with other women too? Or is it just with her?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Other women?" Jason repeated. "Like who?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen was very busy measuring out the water. "Well, I mean, I just mean...anybody. You know. Women in general."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Like you?" Jason said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen almost dropped the drink she was holding. "What? No. No! I didn't mean me, for heaven's sake. I just meant...like I said...other women."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Because," Jason said slowly, "I'm sure Paul keeps you quite satisfied in that area."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, of course," Ellen said quickly. She turned and handed him his drink without looking at him. "Shall we go into the living room?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jason didn't move. "He does, doesn't he?" he said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen now blushed quite perceptibly and turned away again. "I don't think we should be talking about this," she said in a low voice. "Paul and I are perfectly happy, thank you. Now...maybe you should have your drink and go."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jason took a sip of his drink. "I'm sorry," he said. "I didn't mean to offend you, Ellen. It's just that Paul did say something about--Well, you're right, I guess it's not my business."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Paul--Paul said something about what?" Ellen asked. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well...just something about how you're not very...how did he put it? Orgasmic. Meaning that you don't come a lot. That's all."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh Christ!" Ellen said. There was anger in her voice, as well as embarrassment. "I can't believe Paul talked to you about--about our--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, we were talking about Lilah, you know, and it just came up. And I just think it's a shame. You know?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I think you should go," Ellen said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The fact is that no, I can't do with other women what I can do with Lilah," Jason said. "I can't do that with you, and unfortunately I can't tell Paul how to do it. But I should think that he would want to apply himself to learn more about your needs, you know? About what you really want. So that you could be more...responsive."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Paul is fine," Ellen said. Her voice was lower, but there was still some anger there. "He's fine. I love Paul. There's nothing wrong with our--He's a good man. He's loving and tender and--and considerate, and it's really...Oh god, why am I even having this conversation?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I don't know," Jason said. "Maybe it's because you're as curious as I am as to why this good man, this loving and tender and considerate man, can't give you what you really need. You think?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"He does give me what I need!" Ellen said. "Who are you to--Oh god, look, it's--I'm not frigid or anything, okay? It's just that--you know, some women are more--more passionate than others. Some women have lots of orgasms and some are--are just...I don't know...calmer."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Bullshit," Jason said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It's bullshit, Ellen. And I think you know it. All women are responsive to what really turns them on. It's just a question of finding out what that is. You know what I think? I think Paul is so goddam good and loving and tender and considerate that he can't even begin to get to you, not to the real you, because what you need is something else entirely. That's what I think."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You don't know what you're talking about," Ellen said tightly. "I want you to go. Now."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Do you?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, I do."&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm right, aren't I?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Aren't I, Ellen?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No! Just leave!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"In a minute." She was sill turned away from him, facing the sink. He stepped up behind her and with a swift but easy motion raised his hand to her head, tangling his fingers in her short blonde hair. He tightened them just a little, just enough to let her feel the pressure on her scalp.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen took in a sudden sharp breath. "What are you doing?" she demanded.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jason didn't answer. He gave her hair a very slight tug, pulling her head up just a little. Ellen gasped again and made a move to turn around, but doing so put more strain on her hair, so she stayed as she was, facing the sink. "Let me go!" she exclaimed. "What do you--what are--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You like that, Ellen?" Jason said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What? No! Jason, let me go, stop this! I don't know what--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Look at me." He moved his hand so that she could turn toward him, but didn't ease his grip on her hair. Ellen's face was flushed. Her mouth was open, and her breasts rose and fell with her rapid breathing. "Look at me, Ellen."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her eyes rose to his. What he saw in them made him pull her hair a little harder, tugging her head back slightly. Ellen cried out and raised her hands to his wrist, but they were ineffective. "Stop it!" she cried. "Please. Jason, please, don't, what are you doing?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You do like it," Jason said. "You like the pain, don't you, Ellen?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No! What are you talking about? Let me go, damn you. If I tell Paul about this--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I don't think you will," Jason said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen was almost panting now. She seemed to be trembling slightly. The shock and anger that had been in her eyes were rapidly giving way to something else--a look of fear perhaps, or a plea. Plus the thing he had seen in them before.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Jason, please..." she said, her voice lower now, and unsteady. "Please...stop...don't...please..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Are your nipples hard, Ellen?" Jason said, maintaining his grip on her hair.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What? Jason, for god's--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I bet they are." Without haste he raised his free hand to the woman's heaving bosom and placed it on one of her breasts, his fingers sliding across it. Again she took in a sharp breath, but she made no other move. "They are," Jason said. He moved that hand to her other breast and squeezed it slightly. A small whining sound escaped her. "They are, Ellen." He moved his hand down, over her stomach. "And if I felt between your legs I bet I'd find you wet, wouldn't I?" When she said nothing he pulled harder on her hair, forcing her head back a bit more and bringing a keening cry from her open mouth. "Wouldn't I, Ellen?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh god, please..." She was panting hard now. "Jason, don't...oh don't...you're hurting..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And you love it." With his hand in her hair he pulled her face toward him, and without lessening his grip he jammed his mouth down onto her moaning, quivering lips. They were unresponsive at first,&nbsp; but as he continued to kiss her, thrusting his tongue into her mouth and twisting his hand to increase the pressure on her scalp, they gradually came alive. Her moans grew louder and then she was kissing him back, her mouth twisting against his, her tongue meeting his in wild abandon. He twisted harder and her body came against his, the whole length of her pressing fiercely into him, until he pushed her away. He let go of her hair and she stumbled back against the sink.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh my god!" she gasped out. She was struggling for breath. "I--I--can't--" 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Shut up," Jason said. He reached for her, grasping her roughly by the arms, and pulled her to the kitchen table, turning her so that her back was to it. He lifted her onto it and pushed her down, moving between her legs, her skirt rucking up in the process. She tried weakly to struggle, but she stopped when he grasped her wrists and held them down on either side of her head, leaning over her. Her eyes were wide and wild as she stared up at him, still panting.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"This is what you want, isn't it, Ellen?" Jason rasped. "This is how you like it, right?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No...ohh god..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jason pulled her arms up over her head and pinned her wrists with one hand now as he brought the other hand down between her legs. Taking hold of her panties at the crotch, he savagely ripped them open. Ellen gave a cry. "Yeah, you're wet all right," Jason panted. He found the tab of his zipper and yanked it down. His cock pushed out, hard and stiff. He jammed it against her so she could feel it, and she cried out again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Tell me you want it, Ellen," he breathed, looking down into her eyes. Deliberately he ground her wrists hard against the table surface and pressed his weight against her. "Tell me you want me to fuck you."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Ohh...god...ohh...Jason...please..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Say it." He brought his free hand up to her hair again, twisting it, making her head roll. "You want me to fuck you. To rape you. You know it, I know it. Say it!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes!" she cried loudly, sobbing now. "Yes! Do it! Oh god, yes, do it to me, yes!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That's the girl." And Jason rammed himself inside her with one powerful stroke. Immediately her body responded, her torso humping up at him as he began to fuck her. He did it hard and fast, pounding into her steadily, and she emitted a series of cries and whimpers and gasps as she moved with him as much as she could in her awkward position. Deliberately he twisted her hair harder, pulling cruelly at her scalp, and she gave a wild cry, raising her legs and wrapping them around his body, bucking harder beneath him. His other hand tore at her blouse, went inside it to find her breast, and when he squeezed as hard as he could she let out a loud, uncontrollable scream and her body began to jerk and spasm, convulsing strongly, again and again, and again, and bringing on his own climax as he spewed his come inside her.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Don't tell Paul," Ellen said in a low voice. She was standing now, still panting a little as she buttoned her blouse and tried to straighten her clothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Why not?" Jason said. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Why not?" She stared at him. "How can you say that? Do you want to ruin my marriage?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I don't think that will happen, Ellen. I already told Paul I was going to try to seduce you, and he said that was fine."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What?! I don't believe you."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes you do. Why would I lie about that?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I just can't believe Paul would--why would he..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, I told Paul he could have Lilah, you see, and that got him so excited that when I suggested a little reciprocity..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She stared. "You told Paul he could have sex with your wife?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I did."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Why?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, I could say that it was because I wanted you, but the fact is I was pretty sure I could get you anyway. I just--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You bastard," Ellen said. Tears swam in her eyes. "You filthy rotten bastard."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Come on, Ellen. I was right, wasn't I?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh Christ. You piece of..." She swiped the tears from her eyes with an angry gesture. "Yes, I guess you were," she said in a low voice. "But it'll never happen again. Not ever. And if you tell Paul, I'll--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You'll what? Of course I'm going to tell Paul. And don't say it won't happen again, Ellen. Because it will. You're far too passionate for me not to want more of you. Or for you not to want what I can give you."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Never!" Ellen said. "God, what kind of a monster are you? I never want to even see you again. Get out of my house. Now!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You know you don't mean that, Ellen. You want me to show you?" He took a step toward her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No!" She backed away. "Don't touch me!" she said, almost hysterically. "I'll scream. I'll..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Fine," Jerry said. He stopped moving. "I won't touch you. I don't have to touch you, Ellen. You know. You know now. You know what you are and what you need. You're a filthy cunt, Ellen." She stared at him. "You're a filthy cunt whore, a low, crawling piece of slime. You're a walking turd, Ellen, and all you're good for is to please men with your slut body and your hot little cunt. You need to be kept down in the dirt where you belong, to be taken and hurt and used up and then thrown away like the disgusting piece of garbage that you are."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her eyes were wide, her mouth open. "Oh my god," she whispered after a moment. She crossed her arms in front of her and bent over slightly. "Oh my god...oh Jesus..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Come over here, Ellen." She looked up at him again, but she didn't move. She was trembling slightly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Come here, bitch!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her breathing was audible. She hesitated another moment, then moved slowly toward him on unsteady legs, till she was standing in front of him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"On your knees," Jason said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I...I don't...I..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jason spat in her face. She cried out and reeled back as if he had hit her.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"On your knees," he repeated.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen gave a low, quivering moan and sank down to kneel in front of him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His cock was still out, and it had grown almost to full erection again. It stared up at her face.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"With your mouth," Jason said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another small sound came from her throat, but she lowered her head and took his cock in her mouth. Her lips closed around it, and without further instruction she began slowly to suck him. She made small gasping noises which might have been sobs or might have been something else. However, tears trickled slowly down her cheeks as she continued to suck him steadily. Other than his contact with her mouth, he still hadn't touched her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Give me your hands, Ellen," he said now. "No, don't stop sucking, you stupid whore. Just give me your hands." She raised her arms and Jason took hold of her wrists. He held on to them, one in each hand, holding her arms above her head as her lips slid up and down his cock. The tears continued, as did the low gasping noises. But she didn't stop.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"A little deeper, Ellen," Jason said, and he squeezed her wrists hard for just a moment. "And use your tongue more." A muffled cry came from her mouth, and she did her best to obey him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That's it, cocksucker," Jason said. "Keep it up. We'll make a good whore out of you yet. I bet Paul never gets his cock sucked this way. If he only knew what a hot randy little cocksucking cunt you are! Well, maybe we'll show him, right, Ellen?" He squeezed her wrists again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This time the sound she made was definitely a sob. Still she went on sucking him, her arms stretched above her, until with one last squeeze of her wrists Jason let himself go. Instinctively Ellen pulled away, and his come spurted out onto her face and breasts.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jason let her go, and she fell to the floor in a heap. "Next time you'll swallow it, Ellen," he told her. "Isn't that right, cunt?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She made an inarticulate sound. Jason just stood and waited. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes," she whispered finally.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Good girl." Jason zipped himself up and prepared to leave.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Please...don't tell Paul," Ellen gasped out. "Please..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Okay, tell you what," Jason said. "I'll let you tell him."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I have something to tell you," Ellen said to Paul when he came home that evening.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Okay, tell me," Paul said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Jason was here today."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Jason?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Jason."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"How come?" Paul said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I ran into him while I was shopping," Ellen said. "But I think he planned it that way. I invited him for a drink, and he...he told me some interesting things."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul looked nervous. "What--what do you mean?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"He told me about you wanting to fuck his wife," Ellen said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul went pale. "But--no--wait--That was a joke. It was--it was a joke, that's all. We were--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It wasn't a joke, Paul. Don't give me that. Jason told me all about it."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Ellen--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And he told me about how he told you he wanted to fuck me too."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Jesus, we were drunk!" Paul said. "It wasn't--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And you said it was all right."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No! Christ, no, I mean, he just said he wanted to--to try and...I mean, I knew he couldn't--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, you were wrong," Ellen said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul stared at her. "What?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You were wrong," Ellen repeated. "He could. And he did."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"He...he did what?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Seduced me, you idiot. If you want to call it that. Actually it was more like rape. Well, no, not rape. It wasn't rape. Because I wanted it. And I liked it. In fact, I loved it. All right? Now you know." &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul had to sit down. "You...he...he actually..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"He fucked me. Yes. Jason fucked me. And then I sucked his cock."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul could hardly breathe.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And you know what, Paul? I came like crazy." And suddenly Ellen began to cry.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul got up and ran to the bathroom, where he threw up in the toilet.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When he came back Ellen was still crying, but then she stopped.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Why?" Paul said. His voice was unsteady.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen said nothing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He moved close to where she was sitting. "Why, god damn it?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen looked up at him. "You going to hit me, Paul?" she said. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul didn't move.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No," Ellen said. "You're not going to hit me. You couldn't. You can't. That's the kind of man you are. I love you for that. I love you, Paul. But that's why."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What?" Paul said. "What are you talking about?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And you know what?" Ellen said. "Jason told me to tell you about it. I didn't want you to know, I begged him not to tell you, but he said I should tell you myself. So I did."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm going to kill him," Paul said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen laughed. "You couldn't kill anybody, Paul. You know that."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You think I'm not a man? Is that it? Not man enough for you, like Jason?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I think you're a better man than Jason," Ellen said. "But you're not--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Not what? Is his dick bigger than mine, is that it?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No," Ellen said. "That's not it. Jason took me. He fucked me. He saw what I was, somehow. What I... He didn't make love to me. He fucked me. He fucked the shit out of me, Paul. Why don't you do that? I need that. Can you do that, Paul?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No," Paul said. "I don't want to do that. In fact I never want to fucking touch you again." And with that he turned and left the house. When he was gone Ellen started to cry again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I want to see Jason," Paul said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"He's not here now," Lilah said. "He's out with some friends of his. Can I help you, Paul?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No," Paul said. "He fucked my wife."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh," Lilah said. "Already? Come on in, I think you need a drink."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Jesus," Paul said. "What kind of people are you?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Good question," Lilah said. "You want a drink or not?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes," Paul said, and followed her into the house.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As she made them drinks in the living room he said, "You knew that Jason was going to--to try to--with Ellen? You knew that?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Of course," Lilah said. "Jason tells me everything. He told me all about your little deal."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"He--he told you--but it wasn't--Oh Jesus..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lilah handed him his drink and sat down on the sofa. "Have a seat, Paul." Paul took a chair across from her. "And don't take it so hard," Lilah said. "Jason screws every woman he can. And that's a lot of women. There's something about Jason they just can't resist. Hell, I can't resist it either." She took a drink.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul drank too, emptying half his glass. "But Jason...He--he told you about--about what we..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"About me fucking you?" Lilah said. "Oh yes. And he's going to make me do it too. So don't worry, you'll get your part of the bargain."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul stared at her. "He's going to MAKE you do it?" he said. He shook his head. "No. I told him, no. I'm not--I won't--Christ, that's sick! How can he--why would you--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Don't you want to fuck me, Paul?" Lilah said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh Jesus. That's not--I mean, come on. Sure I'd like to fuck you. Christ, who wouldn't? But not if you...not against your will, for god's sake! I told him that. Jason. I told him."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And I bet I know what he said," Lilah said. "I bet he reminded you that you didn't mind watching what he made me do the other night. At your house. You didn't mind that, did you, Paul?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I...I don't...That's not..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And he told you he would make me do that with you. While we're fucking. He told me that part. And it turned you on, didn't it, Paul?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul emptied his glass. "Why would you do that?" he said hoarsely.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Why would I do what? Come when he tells me to? Or fuck you even if I don't want to? Which?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Jesus. Both."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, the first one because I can't help it. You saw that. I have no control over that. It's a physical thing, or a psychological thing, or some kind of hypnosis. Jason says he never hypnotized me, but I don't know. I think he must have. But I can't do anything about it. And Jason loves to show it off. Like a party trick. A trained dog. You saw that too. And the more I try to fight it, the more it turns him on. As for the second thing, well...I don't know. I really don't know. I do what he wants me to do. I don't have to. But I do. Jason has...he's... he sees into people. He can see what they...Oh shit. I don't know." She finished her drink.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Ellen said that," Paul said. "She said he saw what she needed. Is that what you need? To do what he wants? Against your will? That's crazy."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yeah," Lilah said. "That's what it is, all right."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Do you--do you love him?" 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh Christ. Do I love him? I hate him. And yes, I love him. But I hate loving him. Oh shit, enough of this. Do you want to fuck me right now and get it over with?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh my god," Paul said. "I--No. Not that way. Not if you don't want to." He started to take a drink, then realized his glass was empty. "Besides," he said. He put his glass down on a table. "Besides...he said...Jason said...he would make you..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh right. He would make me come for you. I forgot. Okay. Then we'll wait for Jason. He should be back soon, you want to stick around till he shows up?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No," Paul said. "I mean...I don't know. I came here to see him. I came to...to beat him up or something. For fucking my wife."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lilah smiled. "I don't think you'd have much chance of beating Jason up," she said. "He works out a lot. Besides, you told him he could try, remember?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But I didn't think he'd...Ellen said he...he practically raped her. She said he was..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Did she say she liked it?" Lilah said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul said nothing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I thought so," Lilah said. "Let me get you another drink." She rose, but as she started for the bar her cell phone rang. It was lying on the coffee table near the couch, and she picked it up and looked at it. "It's Jason," she said. She pushed a button and put the phone to her ear. "Hello." A pause. "Oh, okay, fine, how long will you be?" A pause. "Whatever, Jason. Oh by the way, Paul's here." A pause. "Yes, he came to beat you up for fucking his wife." A pause. "Yes, but he's still not happy about it. He says you raped her or something." A pause. "Yes, I'm sure she did. I think Paul knows that too, but he still doesn't like it." A pause. "Well, I'm not sure how he feels about that. He says he doesn't want to do it against my will, but he also says he wants to wait until you are around to make me come." A pause. "Jason." A pause. "Jason, I don't--" A pause. "But--" A pause. "Yes. All right. I'll ask him." She turned to Paul. "Jason wants me to ask you if you would like him to make me come right now," she said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Jesus!" Paul said. "No! I mean...Jesus!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"He says no," Lilah said into the phone. A pause. "What? Oh Christ, Jason, I don't know. You want to talk to him?" A pause. A sigh. "All right, I'll ask him." She turned to Paul. "Jason wants to know if you would like to see me naked."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul only stared at her. Then he closed his eyes and shook his head. "I don't believe this," he breathed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I think he's conflicted," Lilah said to the phone. A pause. "Jason, for--" A pause. "But if he--" A pause. "Damn you, Jason." A pause. "Yes, I know." A pause. "Yes." A pause. "Yes, all right." A pause. "Yes I will." A pause. "All right, Jason." She closed the phone and put it down. "Jason says I should strip for you," she said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul's eyes opened. "What?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"He says it's part of the bargain. He saw your wife naked, so now you get to see me that way. He says you can also fuck me if you want, but if you want to wait, that's okay too." Facing him, she brought a hand to the top button of her shirt and opened it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Wait..." Paul said. "Wait. Jesus. But you--you don't want--Jason's--you don't want to do this, right?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Not particularly," Lilah said. "But I'll live." She opened another button, then another.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No," Paul said. "I'm leaving." He got up, a bit unsteadily.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lilah shrugged. "I can't stop you," she said, and took off the shirt. She wore nothing under it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh my god," Paul said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lilah's hands went to the front of her slacks and opened them.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm going," Paul said. "This is not--" But he didn't move.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lilah kicked off her shoes, then pushed the slacks down over her hips, exposing a pair of red bikini panties. She sat down to pull the slacks off, one leg at a time, then stood again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"This is not right," Paul said hoarsely.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lilah pushed the panties down. She bent to slide them down her legs, then kicked them off her feet and straightened up.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul sank back into his chair.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, here I am," Lilah said. "Naked." She turned around, slowly, letting him see all of her, then faced him again. Paul was breathing hard. "Now," Lilah said, "you can leave if you want. Or you can fuck me if you want. Or you can stay and wait for Jason. What's it going to be?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I--I have to go," Paul said. But he didn't move.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lilah shrugged again. Paul watched her breasts. "You want another drink before you leave?" she asked. "I'm having one, for sure." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul watched her behind as she went to the bar. She made the drinks and brought them back, handing him his glass. She returned to the sofa and sat down. After sipping at her drink she placed the glass on the coffee table and lay back on the couch, her legs sprawled carelessly open. "Like the view?" she asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul gulped at his drink. "What do you think?" he said. "Christ, I'm hard as hell, if you want to know the truth. But I can't--I'm not--I won't--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Okay, I get it," Lilah said. "You won't take advantage of a poor helpless girl who's being coerced into doing horrible things against her will. Very noble of you, I'm sure."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul reddened a little. "Come on," he said. "You can't be as blas� about it as all that. You act cynical, but it is against your will, you told me that. Even if you agree to it. You have to feel...something about that. You have to be..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Ashamed?" Lilah said. "Humiliated? Degraded? Pissed off? What?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes," Paul said. "All of those things. Right?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lilah shrugged.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Last night," Paul said. "At my house. You weren't so damn blas� then. You really tried to fight it. You hated it. I could see that."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And you loved it,"Lilah said. "Didn't you, noble Paul."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul reddened again. "That's not the point."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes," Lilah said. "That gets to me. Like I said, that's Jason's parlor trick. With that I have no choice at all. And when he makes it happen in public it's like&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
he's--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"In public?" Paul said. "How can you..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Are you kidding? Jason loves it that way." She reached for her glass and sat up to drink from it, then replaced it and fell back again. "The first time," she said after a pause. "The first time he tried it out when it wasn't just the two of us, we were in this restaurant. Fancy kind of place, tablecloths and everything. Kind of crowded too. So I'm happily eating my salad, chatting away, and suddenly Jason says, 'I want you to come.' Just like that. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Now I already knew he could do this to me, of course. He'd been doing it in private for some time, mostly while we were fucking, but often when we weren't, while I was busy doing other things, just to amuse himself. And I knew he could make it happen however he said--hard, soft, slow, fast, long, short, whatever. But this was--I mean we were out in public, people all around, and I couldn't--I just sort of started shaking my head and saying no, no, but he just grinned at me. And he said..." She paused for a moment, then went on. "He said, 'Now this is a nice respectable place, so we don't want to cause a scene, okay? So I want you to come, and come hard, but not be obvious about it. No one should notice. Quick and hard and dirty, okay, baby?' That's what he said. And I said no, I said I couldn't do it, it would be impossible, and I was begging him, but that just made him happier, the bastard. 'Do it,' he said. 'Do it now.' And of course I did."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Jesus!" Paul said. "How did you--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I don't know," Lilah said. "He said quick and hard, and that's what it was. Quick and hard. It came on me right away, no big buildup like last night, and Jesus, I wanted to scream with it, it was so intense. I had to clamp my mouth closed and keep it that way, and bite my tongue, so that all that came out of me was these low squealing noises I couldn't do anything about. Jason tried to cover them up by faking a coughing spell, but I knew people had to be looking at us. And I couldn't control my body. Oh, I mean I did control it some, or I would have been rolling all over the floor. I stayed in my chair. But I couldn't do too much to keep from jerking and spasming and squirming around. Christ knows what I looked like. And then it was over. Just like that.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, shit, I was sure the whole damn place must have seen everything, and I was mortified as hell. But it turned out I hadn't attracted as much attention as I thought. Most of the place was just going on as usual. Jason said some of the people around us had noticed, but evidently thought I was just having a temporary choking fit or something, and had gone back to their meals. But not all. There were two men sitting at the table next to ours who were still staring at me. One of them was fat and middle-aged, the other was thin and in his thirties. They'd seen what had gone down all right, and their mouths were practically hanging open. I was so embarrassed I couldn't even look at them. But Jason gave them a big smile.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"'You'll have to excuse my wife,' Jason says. 'She gets kind of carried away sometimes.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"'No problem,' the fat one said. I could feel their eyes going over me. I just wanted to get out of there. But Jason said, 'You know how it is with women, right? Just no holding them back sometimes.' And the guys laughed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I knew what was going to happen. I just knew it. Jason had done that before too. Let other men have me. Strangers, casual acquaintances. Just to see me do it. Sometimes I said no. Sometimes, at first, I even cried. But I always did it in the end. And I still do. I just don't cry anymore."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And did he--" Paul said. "Those two men--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh yes. He asked them if they liked me, and they said yes, and he said something about, you know, how I would do anything he wanted, and it gradually dawned on them that he was offering me to them. They couldn't be3ieve it at first, and then they thought I was a whore and asked him how much it would cost, and when he said it was free they still couldn't believe it." Lilah paused. "I could believe it all right," she went on. "Like I said, it wasn't the first time. I knew it wouldn't do any good to object, or to beg him or anything. It would only feed his sense of power, since he knew I would do it anyway. He would even say fine and tell me I could leave. Knowing I wouldn't. Sitting there grinning at me. Knowing I would go along."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But why?" Paul demanded. "That's what I don't understand. Why would you go along? Why would you let&nbsp;&nbsp; him--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Stop asking me that," Lilah said sharply. "I told you I don't fucking know, all right? Jesus!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"All right, I'm sorry," Paul said. He finished his drink. Then he said, "So...so you...with those men..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes. When they finally got it through their thick heads that this was their lucky night, they paid their check and Jason paid ours and we all went out to the parking lot. We used their car, since it was a station wagon, and we all got into the back. Jason told me to strip naked, and I did. The two guys just took their pants down. He wanted me to do them both at once, and they didn't have any objection; at that point they would have done anything just to get at me. The fat guy wanted to fuck my mouth, but Jason said that wasn't a good idea, because he was going to make me come so hard I might bite his dick off. So the fat one lay down and I got on top of him and put his dick inside me, and the other one got behind me and stuck his in my ass." Lilah paused again. "That wasn't a lot of fun," she said. "There was no lube, and it took him a while to get it in far enough to fuck me. Then the two of them had to figure out how they could both fuck me at once that way. Finally they got it though. And they did it. Like I said, it wasn't a lot of fun." She sat up then, picked up her drink and emptied the glass. "Jason waited till they were close to finishing," she said. "It didn't take long, thank god. Then he told me to come. 'Just like before,' he said. 'Only harder.'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, it was like before, only this time I screamed. Good thing it was late, and the car windows were closed. I screamed and screamed, and I was jerking back and forth and convulsing, and both those guys shot inside me, and I could hear Jason laughing." She fell back on the couch again. "That bastard," she said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul's breathing had quickened. "Oh Christ!" he said. "Oh Jesus, I'm so--" He stood up unsteadily. There was a large bulge in the front of his pants. He took a step toward her. "Lilah..." he panted. "I want--I have to--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lilah didn't move. "Okay," she said flatly. "Go ahead then." &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh Jesus!" Paul tore at his clothes. He was awkward and clumsy in his haste, but then he was naked. His cock was hard and throbbing. He moved quickly to the couch and fell on top of her. Lilah spread her legs for him. He poked at her blindly until she reached down and guided him to her opening. He was oozing pre-come, and she smeared it over his cockhead for lubrication before taking him inside her. He gave a great gasp as he plunged into her pussy, and quickly began to fuck her, emitting a series of hoarse cries. Lilah put her arms around him, but otherwise showed no particular response. Paul's face was buried in her shoulder at first, but as he began to move harder his lips moved to her neck, then trailed over her face in a series of slobbering, panting kisses until they reached her mouth. Lilah allowed him to kiss her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul didn't last long. He gave a loud groan as he emptied himself inside her, spurting again and again, then collapsed on top of her. Lilah waited patiently until his breathing slowed and he pulled away from her and sat up. "Oh my god!" he said huskily.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lilah said nothing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After a minute Paul said, "That was...that was the first time I've ever cheated on Ellen."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, she cheated on you first," Lilah said. "So I wouldn't worry about it."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul looked at her then. "You...you didn't..." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Come?" Lilah said. "No. I never come anymore except for Jason."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But you...you didn't...it wasn't..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Don't worry about it," Lilah said again. "You wanted to fuck me and you fucked me. So now you and Jason are even."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul started to say something, but stopped when they heard the sound of the apartment door opening. "What's that?" he whispered, startled.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Probably Jason," Lilah said calmly. "Don't know who else it could be."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh Christ!" Paul grabbed for his clothes, but he only had time to pick up his shirt and hold it in front of his groin before Jason was standing in the doorway. He was smiling.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, well," Jason said. "Looks like you guys have been having a bit of fun. How was she, Paul?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul said nothing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I thought you were going to be late, Jason," Lilah said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Changed my plans," Jason said. "When you told me Paul was here, I thought I'd better come home and see what you two crazy kids were up to. Looks like I missed the show."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You..." Paul said hoarsely, then stopped to clear his throat. "You...fucked my wife."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, I did," Jason said. "And a very good fuck she was too. I'm telling you, Paul, you haven't been giving that woman what she needs. She's as passionate as hell if you just show her who's boss. Did she tell you she sucked my cock too?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul said nothing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Did Lilah do that for you, Paul?" Jason said. "She does it quite well. Not that Ellen is any slouch in that department either, but like I say, you have to get her in the mood first. Whereas Lilah does it well whether she's in the mood or not. If I tell her to. You want me to show you, Paul?" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Christ, you're a bastard," Paul said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jason shrugged. "Well, we made a deal, Paul. I'm sorry if you don't like the way it turned out, but I'm trying to be magnanimous here. You already fucked my wife, but I'm willing to let you enjoy more of her, the same way I did yours. I know you'd like that, wouldn't you, Paul?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul said nothing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And besides," he went on, "I know that what you really wanted was to have me make Lilah come while you're fucking her. That was actually why you agreed to the deal, as I recall. So why don't you let her suck you and get you all hard again, and then we can do that. What do you say?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul cleared his throat again. He didn't look at Lilah. "I--I don't...I don't think she wants to," he managed to say.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Does that matter?" Jason said. "Do you really care about that, Paul?" Paul said nothing. "Don't you actually like it a little bit, that she doesn't want to?" Jason said. "I think we talked about this. It really excites you a little, deep down, doesn't it? Like when I made her come that night at your house. You didn't mind that a bit. Why not be honest about it?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul said nothing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Lilah," Jason said. "Suck the man's dick. Get it nice and hard so he can fuck you again."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"He's right," Lilah said flatly. "You are a bastard." But she turned over onto her hands and knees and moved to Paul at the other end of the sofa. She reached for the shirt he was still holding over his groin and pulled it from his hands. His cock was already stirring. She lowered her head and licked at it with her tongue. Paul caught his breath. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She continued to lick and kiss the slowly expanding member until it was semi-erect, her tongue tracing patterns along the length of it, her lips brushing it gently, breathing warm air over the hardening flesh. Then she took it into her mouth, slowly, still stroking it with her tongue as her lips moved down, slowly down, to the base. As she did this Jason moved to a chair and sat down to watch the performance in comfort.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul's breathing was audible now, and small moans escaped him from time to time as Lilah's head began to bob up and down. He was fully hard now, and still she was able to take him all in, accepting his cockhead into her throat without so much as a gag or a hesitation. Her tongue&nbsp; continued to swirl over the straining flesh, and her lips were both firmly enclosing and caressingly soft as they slid up and down over his rigid pole. She varied her tempo, sucking faster, then slowing down again, seeming to know exactly what would excite him most at any given moment. Her head moved from side to side, enhancing the sensations her mouth was imparting, and one of her hands played gently with his balls. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Told you she was good, didn't I, Paul?" Jason said. "You ready to fuck her now?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul made a sound.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"He's ready," Jason said. "Okay, Li. Make it good now. Give him your best. I'll tell you when to come. Lie down, Paul. Might as well be comfortable, right? Let Lilah do all the work." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul, in something of a daze now, swung his feet up onto the sofa. Lilah made way for him as he slid down until he was lying almost flat, his head resting against the sofa arm. Then she moved up and straddled his hips. Grasping his hard cock, she guided it between her legs and slowly sank down on him. Paul groaned. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She started slowly, moving her hips up and down, taking more of him each time until he was fully inside her. Then she continued to move, rising and falling, bending over him so that her breasts dangled just above his face. Paul's hands rose as if with a life of their own, clutching at her flanks and then sliding up and down over the flesh of her slowly pumping thighs.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"All right, Li," Jason said then. "A nice slow one now, but a big one. Really big. Not too fast, but hard. Show Paul how great he is. And then keep it up. Don't stop till I say so. Okay, baby? Go." &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh...damn...you..." Lilah breathed. She closed her eyes, then opened them again. "You... Oh god..." Her head fell back, and she took in a deep hissing breath as her movement grew stronger. Soon she was panting audibly, and occasionally emitting little grunting sounds. Her breasts bounced and jiggled as she rode Paul harder, her rhythm accelerating incrementally. Each time she sank down on him her hips gave a little twist, grinding her pussy on his cock and bringing little cries of pleasure from his throat. His hands rose to cover her hard-nippled breasts as he began to hump his body upwards to meet her strokes. Her head still hung back, her eyes staring up at the ceiling. Her mouth was wide, panting heavily, and then she began to moan. The moans were low at first, but gradually became louder, and soon they were interspersed with harsh gasps that sounded almost like sobs. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh Christ!" she cried out, and then her head came up and her body bent forward, dislodging his hands from her breasts, which nearly grazed his chest as she crouched over him. Her movements were stronger now, more intense, her fact twisted as she concentrated on her gathering pleasure. Her body writhed strongly as she moved up and down, her thighs flexing and rippling, and the cries that erupted from deep in her throat no longer sounded human. Then she was shouting, almost screaming, and her body was out of control, convulsing in a series of sharp spasmodic jerks, each accompanied by an ear-piercing shriek that seemed to burst from her like an explosion.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul was moaning beneath her, but the sound was virtually drowned out by Lilah's continuing howls. Her convulsions went on and on, and the thrashing and twisting of her body was so strong that it finally caused them to roll off the couch and fall to the floor. Lilah landed on her back, with Paul on top of her, still joined. She hardly seemed to notice, and now she wrapped her arms and legs about him and clutched him to her, still moving spasmodically, her cries diminishing only slightly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That's it, babe, don't stop," Jason called out, and the sound of his voice seemed to reinforce her passion, for she shouted again at full volume and humped herself frenziedly up at the man on top of her. Paul, having already come in her before Jason arrived, had been able to hold out against her wildness thus far, but it was obvious that he couldn't last much longer with her legs encircling his waist and her body twisting and grinding and spasming beneath him. Lilah's eyes were wide but sightless now, her mouth gaping, heaving in air between shouts. Her head rolled, and her hips lifted clear off the floor as her convulsions seemed to get even stronger. Finally Paul gave a yell and his own body stiffened and jerked repeatedly as for the second time that evening he emptied himself into her spasming vagina.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Still Lilah clutched at him, keeping his rapidly shrinking cock inside her, and still her abandoned movements continued, until Jason said, "Okay, Li, you can stop now."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lilah gave a final cry and a brief shudder, and then her body went slack, her arms and legs dropping away, the rolling of her head coming to a stop. As Paul disengaged himself and drew away from her she turned onto her side, curling herself into a fetal position, her harsh, heavy panting interspersed with low keening moans. Paul sat on the floor, leaning against the couch, also panting hard. He looked dazed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, how was it, Paul?" Jason asked, grinning at him. "As good as you expected? Better, I bet." &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Holy Christ!" was all Paul said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Exactly," Jason said. "Worth making our little bargain, wouldn't you say? Worth letting me fuck your wife." &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul said nothing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Ellen never came like that with you, did she?" Jason said. "But she did with me. Well, almost like that anyway. So we know she can. I should think just finding that out would make it worthwhile for you, Paul. You could look at Lilah here as just a bonus."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul shook his head. "Jesus, you're a twisted fuck," he said. "Ellen--she's not that way. You forced her. You raped her. You--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Come on, Paul. I just gave her what she needed. I'm sure she told you that. And you could do it too."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Why not?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I don't do things like that," Paul said. "I'm not&nbsp; a--a sadist like you. I don't hurt women, I don't degrade them, I don't...force them. And certainly not my wife. I love Ellen, I would never--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well if you love her I'd think you'd want to make her happy," Jason said. "And believe me, nothing would make her happier than to have a man who knows who she is and treats her that way. If you don't start doing that, Paul, she's going to leave you sooner or later. And anyway, I don't believe you."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul stared. "You don't believe what?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I don't believe you're this plaster saint who's shocked by the very idea of having power over a woman. And wouldn't dream of using it if you had. I've told you this before, Paul. I saw the way you reacted to what I made Lilah do. I think you're a hypocrite. I think you should admit to yourself that you enjoy it, and that if you let yourself go you could be as much of a sadist as I am. Even with your wife. Maybe especially with your wife."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You're crazy."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Am I?" Jason shrugged. "Okay. That's fine. Because as long as Ellen is unsatisfied, that leaves the way clear for me to go on satisfying her. Maybe you'd like to watch that sometime, Paul. You could learn a thing or two."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No!" Paul said. "This--this bargain, or whatever it was, it was just a--a one-time thing. I don't want you to go near my wife again!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Really?" Jason said. "Does that mean you don't want to see Lilah anymore, Paul? How would you like to have unlimited access to her, any time you want?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lilah made a sound. Paul said nothing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Anyway," Jason went on, "I don't really see how you could stop me from seeing Ellen, you know? If I want it, and she wants it. How do you propose to stop us, Paul?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For a long moment Paul was silent. When he finally spoke his voice was nearly a whisper. "She's a whore," he said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What's that, Paul?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"She's a whore," Paul repeated. "She does want it. What you did to her. She told me that. She said that. She's a filthy slut. She's as sick as you are. I told her I never wanted to touch her again. And I don't. So fuck her all you want. Christ, the two of you deserve each other."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I don't think you mean that, Paul," Jason said. "You just told me you love her, and I'm sure you do. But you don't know her. You have to learn to love what she really is."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"A sick whore," Paul said. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And what you are, too," Jason said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Fuck you," Paul said. He got up then and began to put on his clothes.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Leaving so soon?" Jason said. "Do give my love to your wife, okay?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I don't think I'll be seeing her," Paul said. "I couldn't stand the sight of her right now."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Where will you go?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Don't worry about it," Paul said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Would you like to stay here tonight, Paul? You could fuck Lilah again if you like."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul had finished dressing. He glanced at Lilah, still curled on her side on the floor. He hesitated, but only for a second. "No thanks."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Would you like me to make her come for you once more before you leave?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No," Paul said, and went out.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh well," Jason said to Lilah. "I'm sure there'll be other times. Meanwhile you can come for me, darling. Quick and hard. Right now."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Lilah did. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jason unzipped his trousers as he watched her twisting helplessly on the floor, waiting for her to finish so she could suck his cock.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In spite of his resolution Paul ended up going home after all. He had expected Ellen to be in bed, but she was not. She was sitting in the living room, in the same chair as before, almost as though she hadn't moved since he'd left.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well?" she said with bitter sarcasm. "Did you kill him?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm not speaking to you, you whore," Paul said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen closed her eyes for a moment. "All right," she said then. "I'm a whore. But I've never been unfaithful to you before, Paul. I think you know that."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Big fucking deal," Paul said. "Is that supposed to make it all right?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No," Ellen said. "But if you could only understand..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Understand what? That you're a sick little bitch who'll lie down and spread her legs for anyone who gets rough with you? Oh I understand, all right. I understand so much I want to fucking throw up again."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Do you understand that it has nothing to do with you, Paul? With how I feel about you?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Sure. You love me all to shit, but I can't give you what you really need, right? Only Jason can do that."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Maybe you could," Ellen said. "Maybe you could, Paul. If you wanted to. If you--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well I don't," Paul said. "Not that way. Not any way. I can't even stand the sight of you now."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen blinked back tears. "I don't believe that, Paul. But if you're so angry with me, and you think I'm a whore, and you hate me so much...why don't you show me? I love you, Paul, you can do anything you want to me. Punish me for being a whore."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh, you'd love that. No thanks. Besides, even if I wanted to, I'm all fucked out right now. I screwed Jason's wife tonight. Twice."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh," Ellen said. Then she said, "So we're even."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No. We're not even. We're nowhere near even. It's not the same. Besides, you did it first."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, but it was your idea. That came before anything. If you hadn't--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It was Jason's idea. And I never really thought you'd fuck him. You filthy cunt."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The air seemed to go out of Ellen then. Her body sagged in the chair. "Well, you were wrong, weren't you?" she said softly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes. I was wrong. So if you're horny right now, why don't you call him up and tell him to come over and rape you again. I'm sure he'd be glad to oblige."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"All right," Ellen said. "Maybe I will."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Fine," Paul said, and stomped off to bed. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When he woke in the morning Ellen was gone. He looked around quickly; her clothes and most of her things were in place, her toilet articles still in the bathroom. Paul made himself some breakfast, but he couldn't eat anything. He sat in his kitchen for a long time, doing nothing. Finally he went to the phone and dialed Jason's number. Jason answered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It's Paul," he said tersely. "Have you seen my wife?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, she's here," Jason said. "She's sleeping right now though, Paul. She had kind of a busy night."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul took in a long breath. He was trembling. "Fine," he said then. "You can keep the bitch. Tell her I'll send her things over. Or maybe I'll just burn them all."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Don't be that way, Paul," Jason said. "Ellen still loves you, you know. Look, why don't you come over here? I'm sure she'd be happy to see you. Lilah would too."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No thanks," Paul said. "I'm through with this shit. Besides, I have to go to work. Some of us still work for a living, you know."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, and some of us just live," Jason said. "Seriously, Paul, I think you should come over right now. There's no reason you guys can't still work things out. Especially if you can give her what she needs, and I'll be happy to show you how to do it."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Fuck you," Paul said, and hung up.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He started to drive to his office, but somehow he ended up at Jason's house. He sat outside in his car for a while before getting out and walking to the door.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lilah answered the doorbell. She was naked. Jason stood just behind her, grinning. "I figured you would come, Paul," he said. "Do come in. Make yourself at home. What would you like? It's a little early for a drink, but I can offer you Lilah if you like."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Fuck you," Paul said. "I don't know why I came here, I swear to god."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Sure you do," Jason said. "You love your wife, and you want me to show you how to satisfy her."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"My wife is a whore," Paul said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No she's not," Jason said. "She's just a woman with strong needs, who happened to marry an up-tight prig who won't even acknowledge that he wants the same thing she does."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That's crap!" Paul said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Have a seat, Paul. Lilah, why don't you go up and get Ellen down here. Don't tell her Paul's here, let it be a surprise, okay?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lilah went out. Paul sank heavily into a chair. "What are you going to do?" he asked Jason.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm going to show you just what your wife is," Jason replied. "I know she's told you, but I think there's a part of you that won't really believe it until you actually see it first hand. I'm going to show it to you, and I'm going to show you what to do about it. And I have a feeling you're going to thank me afterward."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You're insane," Paul said, but his voice was weak.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, perhaps a bit," Jason said, smiling. "But who isn't?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A few minutes later Ellen came in, followed by Lilah, who was still naked. Ellen was wearing one of Lilah's robes, which covered her adequately, though it was a bit short. She stopped abruptly in the doorway when she saw Paul, her eyes widening. For a moment it seemed she was about to turn and go out again, but she didn't. She looked at Jason. "What's he doing here?" she demanded.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I invited him, actually," Jason told her. "I thought we could put on a little demonstration for his benefit. And yours too, for that matter. Give him some inspiration, show him what he could have if he treated you right. I think it's only--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No," Ellen said flatly, and this time she did start to leave. But she hadn't taken more than two steps when Jason rapped out sharply, "Stop!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen stopped. She stood still for a moment, then she turned. Her eyes were large again, but her mouth was set, though her lips quivered a little. "Don't do this," she said, a little breathlessly. "I won't do this. Not with him--" 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Come here, Ellen," Jason said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Jason. Please. I can't. Not in front of my husband. Please."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Come here, bitch," Jason said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen faltered. She took a step toward him and stopped. She looked at Paul, then away. She took another step. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Come on, fucktoy," Jason said. "Bring that putrid ass over here. Now!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen gave a little whimper. Her body trembled slightly as she went to him. When she was within reach, Jason took hold of her left wrist and, turning her away from him, bent her arm up behind her, bringing a cry from her throat and causing her to arch her body in reaction to the pain. His other hand grasped at her short blonde hair, pulling her head back sharply, producing another cry, louder this time, which devolved into a series of moans as he held her that way, pulling her head further back while pushing upward on her arm. They were moans of pain at first, but gradually they turned into something else. The pain was still there, but it was mixed with another element, which became more and more predominant. Her face went slack; her eyes closed for a moment, then opened again; the moans got breathier.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You like this, don't you, Ellen?" Jason said, holding her that way. Ellen only moaned. "You enjoy this, right?" He pushed her arm a little higher.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes..." Ellen gasped.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes. Because you're a little pain slut, aren't you, bitch?" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh god..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Say it."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes...ohhh..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You see, Paul?" Jason said. Still keeping his grip on her wrist and hair, he moved her closer to Paul's chair, force-marching her until she was standing directly in front of her husband, her straining body arching toward him. The tie of her robe had come undone, and the garment had pulled open, revealing her breasts and most of the rest of her. Her moans now were interspersed with gasps. "This is your wife, Paul," Jason said. "This is what she is. Tell him, Ellen. Tell your hubby what you are."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Jason...please..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You're a worthless cunt, Ellen. Tell him that." &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Ohh...I...I'm a worthless cunt," Ellen gasped out.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You're a crawling piece of shit. Tell him."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm--I'm a crawling...piece of shit..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, and you need to be punished for that. You need to be forced and used and made to scream. You need to be a fucking slave. Because that's what you are. Right, Ellen? Tell him." He yanked at her hair. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes!" She was sobbing now. "Yes! Yes I am! Yes!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You got that, Paul?" Jason said.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Fuck you," Paul said. His voice was a hollow rasp. "I already know that."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, what are you going to do about it?" Jason said. "You want to hit her? Go ahead. Hit the slut right now. Go on, I know you want to."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No," Paul said tightly. "I wouldn't soil my hands on her."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You want her to suck your cock for you? I guarantee it'll be the best blow job she ever gave you. Or maybe she never did that for you. I bet you thought she wasn't the cock-sucking type, is that it? Your sweet innocent little wife."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I just want to get out of here," Paul said. But he didn't move.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, then you can watch her suck mine instead, how's that?" Jason said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen made a whimpering sound.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You'd like that, wouldn't you, Ellen?" Jason said, pulling at her hair. "Sucking my dick in front of your hubby. How delicious." He let go of her hair then, and turned her to face him before releasing his grip on her arm. "On your knees, cocksucker," he said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen had tears in her eyes. Her head moved slowly from side to side. "I...I can't..." she whispered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jason reached out, took one of her nipples in his fingers and gave it a quick squeeze and a twist, bringing a shrill cry from her before letting go. "Sure you can, you whining little turd," he told her. "That's what you're here for. To shame yourself for Paul. Now get down on your filthy knees and take out my cock and show him how much you love it. Do it, you fucking masochistic twat. Do it right now."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen moaned. Her eyes darted quickly to Paul, then moved away. She moaned again, and then slowly sank down to kneel in front of Jason. With trembling hands she reached for his trousers and pulled down the zipper on his fly. Then she pulled out his cock, which was already hard. Again she shot a quick glance at Paul, who sat stonily in his chair, not meeting her eyes. Then she looked up at Jason. She was panting.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Jason..." she whimpered. "Please..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Do it," Jason said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen moaned again and took his cock in her mouth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"There you go," Jason said. "Now show Paul what he's been missing."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen proceeded to suck him. Tears ran down her face as she did so.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"See, Paul?" Jason said as Ellen's head moved up and down. "This is what your wife is. She's good, too. I don't know if you can tell by watching how good she is, but take my word for it. Oh, she's not as skillful at it as Lilah is, but Lilah's had a lot more practice. I'm sure Ellen will get there in time, if you keep her at it. But she's plenty good enough right now. Don't stop, Ellen. You know, she did this for me that first day I fucked her, Paul, did you know that? After I fucked her for the first time. Right there in your kitchen. She ever blow you in your kitchen, Paul? Or fuck you there, at least? She fucked the shit out of me that first time, on your kitchen table. Man, it was like she couldn't get enough, and she came like gangbusters. After that she got all indignant and pissed off at me--at herself, really--and she said that was the first and last time. And yet a few minutes later there she was, on her knees on the kitchen floor, with my dick in her mouth just like now. See, she can't help it, Paul. It's what she is. If you love her, you have to love that. And I know there's a part of you that does, Paul. Just let it out, for Christ sake. And now I'm gonna fucking come. Swallow it, bitch. Let Paul see you swallow my jizz." And with that he stiffened and shot into her mouth, again and again. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen swallowed it all.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Christ!" Paul said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Is your dick hard, Paul?" Jason said, stepping back from Ellen and tucking his cock back into his pants. "I bet it is. You want her to do that for you now?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Jesus Christ!" Paul said.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Ellen," Jason said. "Suck off your hubby."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Wait," Paul said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Wait for what, Paul?" Jason said. "You want to hurt her first? You want to punish her for doing that to me? She'd like that. You'd like that. Then she'd suck you off even better. Take my word."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I want--" Paul said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What, Paul?" Jason said. "What the fuck is it that you want? Tell us, for god's sake."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I want--" He took a breath. "She didn&#8217;t--she would never--you know--come. With me. Not really. Not...not like..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well that's because you never gave her what she needed, Paul," Jason said. "I keep telling you that."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You said she--you can make her--you can..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, I can't just make her come on command," Jason said. "Not like with Lilah. Lilah's a special case." He grinned over at his wife, who had been watching all this from just inside the doorway. Lilah looked apprehensive, as if she feared he would order her to climax right then. But instead he turned back to Paul. "But I can show you what it takes," he told him.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul looked at his wife, still on her knees. She did not return his gaze. Her head was bowed, and she was sobbing softly. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Show me," Paul said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jason took off his belt.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No," Paul said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jason held the belt out to him. "You do it then."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No, damn it!" Paul said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jason sighed. "Paul, you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs. Especially when the eggs are begging to be broken. Ellen, tell your husband you'd like him to whip you."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen made a sound.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Ellen," Jason said. "Look at me."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen slowly raised her head.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You'd like Paul to whip you, wouldn't you, you twisted little bitch?" Jason said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh god..." Ellen whispered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Say it, cunt."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes..." The word was so faint it could hardly be heard.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Tell him that."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She lowered her head again. "Paul..." she breathed. "I-I want--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Look at him, shitbrain," Jason said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For some moments Ellen didn't move. Then she took a long, quivering breath, raised her head and turned it to face her husband. When she spoke her voice, though still unsteady, was clearer than before.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm sorry, Paul," she said. "I'm such a bitch. I need to be punished. Punish me, Paul. Hurt me. I love you, Paul. I love you. Please hurt me."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul just stared at her for a long moment. Then with sudden startling swiftness he lunged toward her out of his chair, and with an incoherent howl of rage slapped her with all his strength across the face. The blow brought a loud shriek from her and nearly toppled her over. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was sobbing again as Paul got to his feet. He was shaking. His eyes were wild. "Oh Jesus," he rasped. "Oh Christ Jesus." He scrabbled at his pants then, unbuckling, unbuttoning, unzipping, and finally pushing them down, along with his undershorts, dropping them around his ankles. His cock was standing straight up, stiff and straining. He made an inarticulate sound and took a step toward his wife, reaching out to tangle his fingers in her hair and pulling her face to his crotch. Ellen's cry was cut off by his cock as it rammed into her mouth. She began to choke on it until he pulled back, still holding her hair, and started to hump himself in and out of her face. "Bitch!" he panted hoarsely as he did so. "Bitch! Cocksucking bitch!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then suddenly he stopped, pulling himself out of her mouth, but keeping his grip on her hair. "Fuck me, bitch," he rasped out. "Fuck me, whore. Fuck your fucking husband for a change." He stepped back then, his pants still around his ankles, pulling Ellen by the hair so that she was forced to follow him on her knees. When he reached his chair he sat down, but continued to pull at her scalp until she clambered up, gasping and moaning, and climbed onto the chair with him, straddling his legs. Paul pulled her closer, then released her hair and reached down to guide his cock to her pussy. They both cried out as it thrust up inside her to the hilt.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Now..." Paul groaned. "Oh shit Christ fuck me, damn you. Fuck me." And Ellen did. As she moved slowly up and down, he slid a hand between their bodies and grasped her right nipple, clamping it in his fingers. Ellen cried out and began to move harder.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Is that what it takes?" Paul panted. "Fucking bitch twat. Is that it?" With his free hand he slapped her across the face, twisting the constricted nipple with the other. Ellen moaned and her body writhed as her thighs continued to pump up and down.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The open robe had slipped back over her shoulders now and was half falling off her body. Jason took a quick step forward and, grasping the back of the collar, pulled the garment off the rest of the way. The sleeves tugged her arms back momentarily as they slid down and off. Jason dropped the robe and grasped both her wrists, holding them behind her so that her upper body was forced backwards. A loud cry came from her as her breast tautened, pulling against the grip of Paul's fingers. Paul let her go then, but Jason kept his hold on her wrists, contemplating the straining arch of her torso. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Isn't she beautiful that way," he murmured. "God, you're a lucky man, Paul. Are you sure you don't want me to whip her while she's fucking you? She'll come that way for sure, I promise you."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh Jesus!" Paul gasped out. His face was twisted with both pleasure and grief. "Oh god, you fucking filthy rotten piece of shit." It was not clear at that point whether he was referring to Jason or to his wife. He took several harsh, shuddering breaths. "Yes!" he said then, his voice choked but forceful. "Yes! Whip the bitch! Whip the dirty little whore! That's what she wants, right, whore? Do it!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jason released Ellen's wrists. He had dropped the belt to remove her robe, and now he picked it up, holding it by the buckle and wrapping it several times around his hand. Ellen gave a cry of fear, or anticipation, or both. Paul took hold of her hair, this time with both hands, and pulled her face to his, her breasts once again mashing against him. With their faces almost touching he looked directly into her wide moist eyes. "You want it, don't you, you cunt?" he choked out.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Paul..." A whisper.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Don't you?" he demanded.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes..." A sob. "I love you, Paul..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Twisted whore." He kissed her then, pulling her mouth to his, their lips mashing together. The kiss was brief. He pulled her face away and released her hair. His head fell back against the chair. "Don't stop fucking me, cunt. No matter what. Fuck the shit out of me."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Ellen resumed her up and down movement, Jason, who had positioned himself to one side behind her, raised the belt and swung back his arm. An instant later the strap was whistling through the air and cracking with a loud report across the middle of her back.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen screamed. Her head went back, her body instinctively jerking itself away from the pain, pressing her even harder against her husband. After her first shout she gave a series of sharp gasps, ending in a half sob. Her arms went around Paul, clutching at his body.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Don't stop," Paul said. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen's thighs rose and fell. The belt had left a red stripe across her back. Jason raised his arm and slashed it down again, hitting her slightly lower this time. Ellen screamed more loudly, her body jerking and twisting. Her breath came in harsh, spastic gasps. But she didn't stop moving. As Jason raised his arm once more she brought her head forward and down to kiss her husband again, gasping and moaning into his mouth. But when the belt whipped into her for a third time she tore her mouth away with a howl. Her movements became faster and harder, shrill cries coming from her throat between her panting sobs. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"More, Ellen?" Jason said. He was a little breathless himself.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen couldn't answer in words, but her head jerked wildly up and down, her face twisted with pain and lust. Her thighs pumped steadily. Paul was moaning.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I knew you'd love it," Jason said. He whipped her again, and then again, the belt leaving angry stripes on her back from her shoulders to her ass. With each blow her cries became louder and her movements harder. Finally Jason moved directly behind her and began slashing the belt forward and back across her back, whipping her continually, back and forth, back and forth, the strength of his arm seeming to increase rather than diminish.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"YES!" Ellen screamed out, her body twisting uncontrollably under the strap. "YES! YES JESUS AHHH!" She was moving frantically now, her head far back, her hair bouncing and whipping around her face with her frenzied pumping. Paul's moans were louder, his eyes now closed in ecstasy, now wide with amazement as he stared at his shrieking wife. "AAAAHHH YEEESSSS!" she howled. "OHHH GOD PAUL YES AAAIIIEEEEE! HAAAUUUUUGHHHH! GOD I LOVE YOU PAUL YES OH CHRIST YES AAAEEEEE! AAAAIIIIEEEEE! AAAAAUUAAAAEEEEEEE!!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With the last scream her body went into convulsions, flailing and spasming again and again, so strongly that Paul's cock was almost dislodged from her vagina. But he managed to keep the connection by arching his hips and humping up at her, and a hoarse shout came from his throat as her fierce gyrations caused him to shoot everything he had up inside her. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He slumped back in his chair as Ellen's wild movements gradually subsided, her screams diminishing into moans, her breath coming in irregular gasps. Finally she collapsed against him, the occasional spasm still overtaking her shuddering body.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Christ!" Paul said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jason smiled. "You see, Paul?" he said, a little breathlessly. "And you thought she wasn't orgasmic!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen was still moaning softly. "I'm sorry, Paul," she whimpered. Her face was buried in his shoulder now, and the words were muffled. "I'm such a bitch. I'm sorry."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes you are," Paul said. His voice sounded strained. Once again he brought a hand to her hair and clutched it tightly, and she gave a little shriek as he pulled her head up, forcing her to look at him. "And if that's what you want, that's what you'll get," Paul said. And then he spat in her face.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The sound she made was one of shock as she stared at him. Paul let go of her hair. "Get the fuck off me, cunt," he said. He pushed himself forward in the chair and then stood up, spilling Ellen unceremoniously to the floor. "I think we'll be leaving now," he said to Jason. He pulled up his pants and shorts and put himself back together. "Unless you want to fuck this worthless thing again," he added, indicating the woman at his feet.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well thanks," Jason said. "But she pretty much emptied me out for now. However, if the offer is still open in the future..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Any time," Paul said. "Any time, any way. Right, bitch?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen whimpered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"On the other hand," Jason said, looking over at his naked wife, "here's poor Lilah, all undressed and ready to go. How about it, Li? A little girl-girl action?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen whimpered again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No thanks," Lilah said. "You know I don't go that way."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Lilah," Jason said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lilah looked at him with sudden apprehension. "Jason..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jason smiled at her. "It might be interesting," he said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lilah took a deep breath and let it out. Her body seemed to slump a little. "Oh Christ," Lilah said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What do you think, Paul?" Jason said. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul hesitated, then shook his head. "Maybe another time," he said. "I just want to take her home now. Let's go, whore."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen, still breathing hard, started to get to her feet. "No," Paul told her. "Don't get up, cocksucker. You can crawl, like the animal bitch you are."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ellen moaned softly and sank to her knees. Then, as Paul waited, she bent forward and placed herself on all fours. Her head drooped.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jason was still holding his belt. Now he held it out to Paul. "Here," he said, grinning. "You can use this for a leash."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Thanks." Taking the belt, Paul put it around Ellen's neck, threading the tip of it through the buckle and pulling it tight, so that it formed a combination collar and leash. Holding the end in his hand, he started toward the door, pulling Ellen with him on her hands and knees. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"My clothes..." Ellen whimpered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Forget your clothes," Paul said harshly. "Animals don't need clothes. Let's go." He continued to pull her toward the door. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her head came up, her eyes wide. "Paul..."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Shut up, cunt." The tightness of the belt around her neck as he tugged on it made her choke, and she was forced to follow him, gasping for breath. Jason moved to the front door and opened it for them. Ellen gave a constricted moan as Paul moved through it, pulling her along.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Have fun, kids," Jason said. He stood in the doorway watching Paul leading his naked crawling wife down the short path to the sidewalk and then to where his car was parked a few yards down the street. Paul opened the door and Ellen crawled in. Jason watched until Paul had gotten behind the wheel and driven away. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fortunately there was no one else on the street. But as Jason was about to close the door he saw his next-door neighbor, Frank Graham, come out of his house and stand on his porch staring at the departing car, his face a study in astonishment and disbelief. Graham was a retired accountant, a widower in his sixties, who had just recently come to live in the house next door with his married daughter and her husband. Jason had only met him once, briefly, as he was moving in. He had evidently been looking out his window and had seen Paul and Ellen as they came out. Now, as he shook his head in bewilderment, he caught sight of Jason standing at his open door. He started to call out; then instead came off his porch and crossed the lawn to confront him. He was a short man with thin gray hair and rimless glasses. His face was a bit red, his eyes still wide with shock and confusion.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Was that--Did you--I just saw--" he began, then stopped to take a breath. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Calm down, Mr. Graham," Jason said soothingly. "What's the matter?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What's--That was--It was a naked woman! Crawling! With a man--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Really?" Jason said. "A naked woman? Are you sure?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I--I saw it! What's going on here? Are you--How could this--"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, strange things happen in this neighborhood sometimes," Jason said. "I really wouldn't worry about it, sir. Anyway, maybe it was just an illusion. Have you been drinking, Mr. Graham?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Graham drew himself up. "No sir, I have not!" he declared. "And I know what I saw. I don't know what's going on here, but I think I'd better call the police!"
