Part One "So you Treasure your Nipple?"
I have decided to take you for a while to the Ch&acirc;teau d&acute;Eperon
  in the region of Reims. 
The owners are friends there from my time in Paris. They are also in the hierarchy
  of the commissariat and I share some leisure interests with them. 
Our car pulls up along the stable-flanked gravel entrance road, in front of
  the oaken main door. Getting out, you notice a fishpond full of large yellow
  carp attracted to the surface by the gentle falling rain and by fish feed slowly
  sprinkled by a hefty, rough-featured gardener. 
We are soon inside and I bring in two large suitcases and your own. We are
  the only guests this warm May night, and the intendants  feed us efficiently
  and convivially, imbuing us with mature red Bordeaux Rouge, and then, perhaps
  uncannily, they melt away into the long corridors. I lead you up the back stairs
  into a large sequestered, well-appointed, warm, ancient attic bedroom under
  bare black rafters. 
I uncork Schreiner  champagne from the bar and pour two glasses.
  You sit quietly and somewhat self-consciously on the dark red sofa, sipping
  the sharp white wine, the ephemeral bubbles tingling on the roof of your mouth.
  I arrange a few things in the bedroom next door, and then come to sit by you.
  We toast together and you see I am starting to look at you in a more concentrated,
  single-minded way. I put my hand on your jeans, on your right thigh. 
�Wait. What are you doing?� you blurt. I do not remove my hand but gently
  stroke your forehead with the other one. You respond immediately, as you always
  do, arching your neck back, following the caress of my fingers as they travel
  over your forehead. This response is automatic, one of your stirring dances.
  It testifies only to your subordination before the rule of Eros and carnal
  pleasure, no more than that. Many men have taken you only in this way, eventually
  jading the thrill for you. 
The hand on your thigh moves further up. You issue a soft, preliminary, gentle �No� into
  thin air. But the hand is now at the top of your thigh and the other has taken
  hold of your hair, turning your face towards me. You think that maybe you can
  see the first light of desire somewhere in the depths of my eyes. We have now
  taken the first tiny step in the long journey towards my ultimate goal this
  week. 
You snap out of it. �Not yet. Let's talk a bit, first� you say. And many men
  stop there, not recognising your well-camouflaged desires, this quintessential
  behavioural self-contradiction a la Japonaise . But this time you
  know it there will be no stopping, that in coming here with me you have already
  irrevocably crossed some threshold� 
Still holding your hair I speak to you, for the first time softly but firmly. �Listen,
  now, Pia. You are pretty and intelligent. But you have much to learn, so much
  to understand about the structural truths of heterosexual interaction, the
  raw nature that was seared into our souls long before the advent of significant
  human consciousness. But you will learn here with me.� 
You feel uncomfortable with this demeanour of mine, which resembles that of
  a doctor, a teacher, even a priest. Is he trying to belittle me? Does he respect
  me? But I am anxious to persuade and explain, and you are, naturally, curious. �What
  do you mean, learn?� you retort. 
�You will learn here slowly as our time together elapses. But firstly, you
  must understand that I will have zero tolerance of resistance this week. And
  I mean absolutely zero.� 
I pull your head towards me, kiss your lips softly, then more forcefully,
  relishing your sweet femininity, your vibrant youth. For an instant your previous
  thoughts and doubts disappear and you yield, luxuriating in being kissed in
  this way. 
�Now, take off your clothes.� 
�What..?� You had hoped things would go more slowly, idyllically� 
�Pia, either you take off your clothes now or I will have to do it. And if
  I have to do it I can assure you that neither you nor your clothes will like
  it one bit.� 
�No. Not yet. I don't want to. Not yet�I want to go for a walk outside.� You
  move to get up. 
I assert myself in my usual and practiced manner. Slow and controlled, I take
  hold of your wrists, the first clear act of physical domination, then take
  out handcuffs from my pocket and clip your wrists behind your back. You do
  not resist but look straight ahead and agitatedly but softly, almost under
  your breath, exclaim �What do you think you are doing!?� 
I do not answer but take hold of your hair again and carefully pull you up
  onto your feet and over to a wooden post in the centre of the room. I unfasten
  the handcuffs and refasten them with your hands cuffed behind the post. 
I leave you wedded to the post and go back into the bedroom. Because I am
  gone you feel a strong reality check, a swell of shame at having allowed this
  to happen, then waves of defiance invade you. You grapple for the safety catches
  on the handcuffs, but there are none. These are different from the ones in
  Heidelberg. There is no way of opening them without the key. The first pangs
  of frustration. 
I return to the lounge holding a sharp, six-inch-long steel hunting knife
  with a black leather handle and curved at the tip. A quick surge of panic and
  adrenaline runs through you. �What are you going to do!?� you blurt. 
I bring the knife close to your face. �My dear, I gave you a chance to cooperate.
  Unfortunately you declined and now it is too late�. 
I hook the tip of the curved blade through the front of your blouse, and slide
  it down. 
The honed knife quietly slides down, bisecting your blouse, and the fabric
  parts without a fight, obediently falling asunder, revealing your lacy black
  bra. 
�Look what you've just done!� you angrily complain. �Asshole!� 
�Well, well!� I retort, with an amused smile. �Foul words and frowns cannot
  repel an ardent man. You will now be stripped of your modesty, my dear. You
  will be fully exposed to me�. 
I stop, and admire you, before sliding the knife under the bra straps. 
�No, don't!� again loudly. �That's my nicest bra. Please!� 
The �Please' has pleased me. It is the first sign of imploring. But the knife
  talks only by action. With a satisfied smile I deftly nick through the bra
  straps. The bra falls softly to the ground and your charms are open to my gaze.
  You sigh, frustrated. I pause again, admiring your rounded breasts and pert
  nipples. 
You watch as I take your right nipple between thumb and forefinger, and squeeze
  it slightly, sending a charge running from your nipple directly between your
  legs, and your knees weaken palpably. Moving closer, I whisper in your ear: �Your
  nipples are erect. Clearly, you are already turned on by the shame of having
  delivered yourself so easily up to me, and at the realisation that you are
  powerless to resist whatever I wish to do to you.� You are shaking your head,
  trying to deny this. I continue. �Your breasts are exquisite, my dear. And
  I have had much enjoyment with these nipples on past nights, have I not?� 
You reply this time, softly, almost inaudibly, as if only to yourself - �I
  hope so�. 
Standing back slightly, I slowly run the flat surface of the knife across
  your right nipple, which stiffens further under the cold steel. This elicits
  another soft �No, please�, but your breathing is accelerating now, giving you
  unmistakeably away. You are fundamentally easy, helpless prey, now squarely
  pinned in the sights of a strong, merciless predator. Smiling, I place the
  tip of the knife under a nipple and push upwards slightly, not enough to break
  the skin. 
�No don't! Please!� you burst out, standing on your tiptoes, adrenaline surging
  now, straining upwards, futilely trying to escape the knifepoint. 
�Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy, Pia. You seemed to place some value
  on your bra. How much do you treasure your nipple? It is significantly more
  difficult to replace. I could now push this knifepoint up into it, couldn't
  I? And I can assure you that would give me infinitely more pleasure than simply
  snipping your polyester bra straps.� 
I remove the knife. �I will pay closer attention to your nipples later. But
  remember it is within my power to do anything I wish to you. And that the only
  way you can possibly influence what happens to you is by submission.� 
Your jeans are tight fitting. I start on them with the knife at your feet
  but you kick out, half-heartedly, but enough to prevent easy work. Without
  the slightest annoyance, and saying nothing, I return to the bedroom, and then
  come back with a metre-long metal bar and three lengths of rope. The metal
  bar is placed on the ground and I take hold of an ankle, pulling it to one
  side. Tight clove hitches are made and your ankles are lashed solidly to the
  bar, wide apart. The third length ties the middle of the bar to the post in
  a neat figure-of-eight. Your legs are now spread and immobile. 
The knife is slipped under your jeans and works its way up the tight fitting
  inside of one leg, then the other. Cutting the jeans from your hips is more
  delicate but I of course succeed, without grazing your skin. I remove your
  shoes and you are left in only your panties. 
I stand back again, appreciating the curve of your hips, your slim, athletic
  body. �Now, how should I cut the panties off?� I ask you. �Should I cut through
  the side? Well, what do you think?� 
You look away from my face. You would not answer such a question. 
�No. This is what I will do,� I decide. I am now behind you, and I pull your
  panties upwards, tight between your sex lips and buttocks. 
�The school kids in their changing rooms call this a `wedgie` and the word
  is even in the Oxford English Dictionary now, you know.� 
But now the knife is cutting downwards behind you, tearing the back of your
  panties, and you feel the blunt edge sliding between your ass cheeks, then
  under, between your splayed legs. I linger there, and push the edge up between
  your lips. I hold the knife handle with both hands, and more firmly press upwards,
  the blunt edge now pushing strongly into you. No pain, but discomfort. You
  try again to tiptoe but cannot now. A small movement of the knife and the pressure
  is on your clitoris and your delicate piercing ring. 
�Can you feel the cold steel?� I ask. �Does it turn you on? Lets find out,
  shall we?� I remove the knife and my finger now slides in your panties and
  caresses your vaginal lips, before moving inwards inside you. 
�Much as I thought, Pia. You are hot for this aren't you?� 
�No! That's not true!� you cry, breaking your calm, in heated shame. �Stop
  it. Untie me. Let me go!� you shout. 
I quickly slash with the knife through your panties and they are now halved. 
Nicking the sides, they drop to the ground and you are completely naked before
  me, your breasts heaving in anger. 
End of Part One. 
Petulant Pia 
Part Two The Sharp employ the Sharp
I place the knife on the table, stand back and admire you again, naked and
  bound before me. This is how I like to have my Pia. You see my eyes roaming
  over your body, my eyes taking hold of your breasts, my eyes parting your legs,
  my eyes possessing your sex. Although I have seen you like this several times
  before, still feelings of shame run over you, shame at having let yourself
  so easily be manoeuvred into this position, at being exposed in this way to
  a dominant man. And you know that your naked body arouses me, stimulates me
  to creative thought of acts I could inflict on you, and you start imagining
  which wild ideas might be going through my mind. No! Rebellion returns. You
  won't let anything happen! You snap out again and commence a quick invective. �That's
  enough now. You've had your little fun. Now let me go and we'll pretend this
  never happened. I want to put new clothes on. I want to go for a walk. Untie
  me! Let�� I clamp my hand strongly over your mouth, pressing your head back
  against the post, cutting off this little tirade. 
�Subdue your anger, Pia, or it will subdue you. Had my little fun, have I?
  Want to get dressed, do you?� My voice is, for the first time, slightly tinged
  with controlled sarcasm. �You can forget about getting dressed for a long while.
  You know very well that I am going to take want I want from you. The only sensible
  choice for you is to cooperate. If you do not then I will take you anyway.
  You will either voluntarily acquiesce or I will possess you by force, all of
  you. Depending on my inclination, I may decide initially to possess you using
  solely physical strength, and, believe me, brutally raping you would procure
  me immense satisfaction � it is the purest manifestation of male sexual power
  over a woman. 
Notwithstanding, whether I rape you or not, you will eventually willingly
  and lovingly submit to me. I will not release you until you reach the wonderland
  of submission where you do not wish for release. � 
I take my hand from your subdued mouth and hold both nipples again between
  thumb and forefinger of each hand, twisting them now, until I see a wince on
  your face. This was deliberately inflicted pain. 
�Now we need something to keep that impertinent mouth of yours shut for a
  while don't we?� 
I pull both nipples down and you must slide down the post. You are now on
  your knees, legs tied apart, hands cuffed behind your back and the post. I
  let go of your nipples and stand up. You cannot get up from this position. 
�Now Pia. You are in the position to which all women should aspire � on your
  knees, ready to pleasure me. If you work hard at pleasing me you will not suffer
  quite as much later.� 
Your face is at the level of my hips. I undo my zipper and bring out my cock
  in front of your face. It is hard, its angry head purple with desire. 
But your subordinate position only heightens your resolve and your green eyes
  defiantly flash. �You'll never get me to cooperate! Never!� Your will is fully
  intact. You again turn your face away. 
I smile broadly at this and put my cock away, zipping up again. �It's quite
  delightful of you to resist like that. This is the response I wanted. It's
  a gift to me, you know. In fact we both know what it means. It's a delectable,
  ostentatious, lascivious come-on for me to inflict the most sadistic of my
  desires on you, isn't it?� 
�No!!� you shake your head again. �No it isn't.� 
But I am not listening and am untying you from the post, clipping your hands
  again behind your back. I untie the leg restraint and pull you up onto your
  feet, guiding you into the bedroom. The bedroom is again spacious, in tones
  of yellow ochre and orange rust. The bed is large and you notice many � points
  de fixation �. 
�It is time for you to feel constraint, to feel the firm guidance of tight
  bondage. 
We are all of us the worse for too much liberty, are we not?� 
I bring out a rope and slowly tie it into a six-coil hangman's noose. The
  noose is looped over your neck and with it I pull you onto the bed, constricting
  your throat, albeit not excessively, and I tie the free end over the headboard. 
�May I remind you again that there is to be no physical resistance.� 
The next constraint is in the form of a thin string which I loop around your
  clitoral ring, run between your sex lips, and pull back between your sex lips
  and tie to the bottom bar on the bed. Next I reveal a small two-pronged hook
  on a string. I show it to you. There is never a blitzed surprise. I always
  take my time, introducing you fully to each instrument that I am going to use
  on you. 
I turn you over on your back and hook the prongs in your nostrils and loop
  the string over the headboard in a round turn and two half hitches. Now comes
  the tension. I slowly pull the clitoral string, causing you to shift down the
  bed, and this tightens the hook in your nostrils. Your nostrils are in discomfort,
  your head arched back, your neck stretched with the noose tightening further,
  but this tension is necessary to prevent sharp pain in your clitoris. Your
  legs are closed tightly, hiding the fishing line from view. 
�There is always tension in life, always a balance to be struck.� I say. �Many
  tensions are necessary, such as those involved in making occasional decisions
  between work and play, or between family and friends. But your predicament
  here mirrors another, strong tension your life, Pia, a tension that you perceive
  between sexual independence and submitting to me. 
You are here because you yearn for domination, and yet you resist it. You
  crave overpowering, for your will to be forced, but you are too proud to admit
  this. Well, I will indeed break your will, but only because it entertains me
  to do so. And as spin-offs I will satisfy this selfish, hedonistic craving
  of yours and will lead you to the paradise of total submission. You will bitterly
  regret not having utterly sacrificed yourself earlier.� 
A new rope is tied to your left knee. �Your legs are closed. You must learn
  to always open your legs, at every opportunity, in my presence. This must be
  automatic. You will have no secret, feminine intimacy to hide from me � nothing.
  Your raison d'&ecirc;tre  will be to please me sexually and the most
  basic manifestation of this is your constant availability to be used for penetration.
  If you try to close your legs, then I will force them open, rape you mercilessly,
  then punish you severely, each time, until eventually you have learned and
  assimilated.� 
I pull the rope and your left leg parts. I tie the rope to the side of the
  bed. The same with the right leg and your legs are now stretched wide apart,
  with the clitoral ring pulled down with its wire taut in between your vaginal
  lips. 
I go into the bathroom and you must again wait. I return carrying a jar of
  fluid. In the jar you can see several large fishhooks, each about three centimetres
  long. I take one out of the sterilising fluid and hold it in front of your
  face, turning it round for your inspection. This cold, shining, steel hook
  has a viciously sharp point and is cruelly barbed. These are not the small,
  innocent hooks we had played with previously. 
�You�you're not intending�� you stammer, your stomach instantly gripped by
  fear. 
�The sharp employ the sharp, don't you think? The gardener gave them to me
  when we arrived. He needs them to snag the large carp in the front pond for
  inspection, but they are also available to snag women who let them be lured
  here by the irresistible bait of a dominant man. He knows exactly what I need
  them for.� 
I continue. � Will you please remember, throughout our s&eacute;ance this
  evening, that I have it in my power to inflict pain on you at any moment and
  to whatever degree I choose. Might is the measure of right. Sex is too important
  for prevarication and niceties � it is the future of mankind and hence the
  dominion of the sword. If you fail to obey, or even to serve my sexual needs
  with what I judge to be your full ability, then you will cry out in pain, immediately.
  Do you understand that?� 
You panic now, trembling visibly. �You wouldn't�� This is going far too far. �You
  couldn't�� 
�I can see the fear in your eyes, Pia.� I say calmly. �The fear is justified� 
I take the first large hook and calmly twist a piece of string around it.
  I take the nostril hook out now and loosen the noose. Why? You look down. That
  is why. So that you should look at what will happen to you. The hook is making
  its way to the underside of your left breast. I scratch its honed point gently,
  playfully, over the skin. Then push gently. 
The tip of the hook breaks through the skin. I push further. A sharp pain
  now pierces your breast. �Ouch!� The tip of the hook re-emerges. The underside
  of your breast is hooked. 
Another hook is pushed through the underside of your right breast. I pull
  on both ropes gently, eliciting a yelp from you and �Please stop. Please. That's
  enough.� 
I do not respond. You see my cock, out again, bobbing by your side. You realise
  that pushing the hooks through your skin has excited me. This revelation leads
  to a cocktail of contradictory emotions; a sickening feeling in the pit of
  your stomach arising from fleeting thoughts as to where this might all lead,
  but also excitement at the clear proof that I am not doing this for you, but
  for my own sadistic pleasure. 
�You see my cock, Pia?� 
�Yes.� 
�What thoughts go through your mind when you see it?� 
�What do you mean?� 
�I will explain to you what you must think. When you see my cock, or indeed
  when you do not see it, your only desire must be to strive with everything
  in your feminine power to make it hard. You should lovingly look up into my
  eyes, begging for permission to suck it and pleasure it and bring it to ejaculation.
  Moreover, seeing that hooking your breasts has excited me should provoke a
  feeling of deep satisfaction in you, because you have long pined for pain at
  the hands of a strong, sexually-aroused man. � 
You wonder. Yes, it is true that I long to suffer, to be taken, to be dominated
  and forced to submit. But why does he  want to dominate me ?
  What drives him ? Is it just to have unfettered, uncomplicated, unlimited
  penetration? After all, that is the essence of what all men want, isn't it?
  Maybe he is no different from all the others? Or maybe he is doing this just
  for my own good? Maybe he loves me, knows what I desire, and just wants to
  make me happy? 
�Why do you wish for power over me?� you ask. 
I answer. �You are maybe wondering whether my desire for power over you is
  motivated by love?� You nod. �That is foolish, Pia. You should know better
  than to imagine a thing like that. I will now hurt you.� 
I take out another, even bigger hook from another jar that you had not seen.
  Panic returns. 
�Pia, there are three stages in your education. There is learning, there is
  understanding, and there is acceptance. You have already learned a lot in the
  six months that we have known each other. It is time for you to enter the understanding
  phase.� 
I bring the hook in front of your eyes again, and then move it slowly down
  to the underside of your left nipple. The tip of the hook grazes the nipple � the
  skin does not break. You are trembling uncontrollably. 
�Now I will tell you the answer to your question. I seek power over you entirely
  for its own sake. What pure sexual power means you will understand presently.
  But first consider power in everyday life, in politics, for example. Some leaders
  do not want real power. They dominate reluctantly, unwillingly, and hope for
  a limited tenure. But they are cowards. No true leader seizes power with the
  intention of relinquishing it. And my power over you will last our lifetimes
  and even beyond, as both you and I will write perennial elegies to it. Power
  is not a means, it is an end. The object of power is power.� 
Despite your predicament and fear you must absorb what I have said, but say
  nothing. 
Still holding the hook close to your nipple, I continue. �How does a man assert
  his power over a defenceless woman, Pia?� 
A pause. �By making her suffer?� you venture, quivering. 
�Exactly. By making her suffer. Obedience is not enough. Unless she is suffering,
  how can a man be sure that she is obeying his will and not her own? Power is
  in inflicting pain. And for this, the femininity, intimacy and sensitivity
  of your nipples render them prime targets.� 
I push the large hook through the nipple. You scream out now. Loudly. A tiny
  trickle of blood seeps out of your nipple as the cruel barb breaks through
  the other side. 
I muse, contentedly. �Isn't it beautiful how nature has constructed us with
  bilateral symmetry. This presents us with the possibility of repeating nipple
  piercing.� 
The same operation is performed with another hook, through the other nipple.
  Another scream. And desperate panic, as you cannot imagine how these barbed
  hooks can ever come out again. 
I tie all four hook strings together, then, with sheet bends, to a thicker
  rope. You now see a pulley attached above the bed to the low ceiling. I loop
  the thick rope through the pulley and pull it taught. The four hooks stand
  to attention, working, taut, admirably serving their purpose. I replace the
  nostril hook and pull it tight, forcing your head to arch backwards again.
  I tighten the noose around your neck, constricting your throat, and I leave
  the room. 
End of Part Two
Petulant Pia 
Part Three � �Thou shalt? No � Thou Art!� 
Lying there with your legs forced apart, discomfort
  in your clitoris, your nose hooked, a tight band around your neck allowing
  breathing only with difficulty, and with severe pain in your breasts and nipples,
  you still manage some fleeting considerations, racing through your tormented,
  twisted and confused mind. You are happy that domination pleases me. This is
  what you have longed for � to
  be mastered. Also the pain is exciting, bringing you to new, heady heights.
  But still, you are scared of losing control of your mind. �If I submit only
  with my body now,� you think, �do everything he says, pretend, then maybe he
  will be easier on me. I will get the kick of being dominated and maybe I still
  won't have to surrender absolutely everything to him. Maybe he won't see that
  I retain essential control of myself. I have submitted here for a while. But
  only physically. I still control my mind.� Mentally you are still defiant. �He
  will never totally break me. No man ever has. No man is strong enough. I will
  take everything he inflicts on me but will never concede my soul.� But you
  are also troubled and apprehensive. I have been gone for a long while now.
  What was that Latin proverb? � Be on your guard against a silent dog and still
  water. Silent, enduring pain. 
I eventually return and remove the nostril hook again. �Now Pia, what are
  you thinking?� 
�I want to make you happy.� you say, softly, hoping that for some reason this
  will trigger release from the hooks. 
�I am afraid that you are not totally honest. You are selfish, not selfless.
  You are thinking of your own comfort rather than my pleasure. I must hurt you
  for that. � 
I replace the nose hook and pull the rope on the pulley. Your breasts are
  pulled upwards, distorted by the four uncompromising hooks. Your bowed body
  arches further. I pull harder. You clench your teeth, trying to remain silent. 
�You look delightful like that.� But then my tone hardens, I speak more firmly. �I
  am not content with negative obedience, nor even with the most abject submission.
  When finally you surrender to me, it will be of your own free will. I will
  convert you; I will capture your inner mind and reshape you. I will burn all
  thoughts of resistance and sexual independence out of you, not in appearance,
  but genuinely, in heart and soul. It is intolerable to me that a single erroneous,
  rebellious thought should ever exist in your mind, however secret and powerless
  it may be. The command of the medieval witch torturers was �Thou shalt not.� The
  command in Stalin's death camps was �Thou shalt�. My command to you is � Thou
  art �.� 
I slide my finger into your sex. 
�You are wet again, Pia. Very wet.� 
�No I'm not.� you whisper between clenched teeth, a foolish remnant of resistance. 
�You should know better than to try to contradict me on that�. I pull again. 
Bolts of pain shoot through your nipples, breasts and clitoris. 
�Aaargh..!� Your silent resistance has not lasted last long, and your breathing
  accelerates, quickened from constriction by the noose, ever tightening under
  your struggles, your face reddening. 
�We both know what your wetness means. It means that you are a slut. 
Not in the common usage of the word, but rather, you are a pain slut.� 
�Nooooo�..!� A sharp pull on the clitoral wire. 
�Yes, Pia. You need intense sexual pain. It is good so. Pain is life, and
  will integrate into the centre of your future.� 
�Now.� �Look at my cock again. What do you wish for?� 
Sullen, pained, silent resistance. 
�These hooks are much, much stronger than your nipples. I will have no compunction
  in destroying your nipples right now if I have to.� �What are you now thinking?� I
  pull again. 
The pain is now too great. You cannot stand it. Even with your head arched
  back you can see the nipple hooks pulling so hard it is clear that they are
  close to tearing through. 
�Please!! Stop!!� 
�No, Pia!� �That is the wrong answer!� and I pull all five wires harder. 
Lightning pain sears your clitoris. 
�Stop! Please!! Anything you want! I'll do anything!� 
�Will you?� 
�Yes!! Anything!!� 
�Will you take a six-inch diameter studded dildo?� 
Intolerable, inexorable, lancing pain. Your face is contorted. 
�Yeesss!� you are screaming, desperate, frenzied under the atrocious suffering. 
�Will you fuck the whole of my football team!� 
�Yes!! Anything! Stop!!� 
I pull again, the nipples now at ripping point. 
�Are you eager, at every instant, to be penetrated by me, by anything I wish,
  or any persons I wish and in which ever orifice I wish for the rest of your
  life?� 
�YESS!! ANYYYTHINGGG!!� 
At this I slowly release the pressure on the hooks and slowly remove the noose,
  the nostril tether, the clitoral wire, the leg ropes. With wire cutters I cut
  through the hooks so that the barbs must not be pulled through your breasts
  and nipples. And, for the first time, I remove your handcuffs from behind your
  back. 
Still in intense pain, crying profusely, with bleeding nipples and breasts,
  your one thought now is to please me. This desire is now etched into your consciousness.
  Softly now you are repeating the mantra. �Anything you want. I will do anything.
  Anything.� 
�You may pleasure me now.� I say firmly. 
You turn and see my stiff cock. � Yes. I want to suck you. Please. Give me
  your cock! I want you to come. Pleeeassse..!� and I allow you, still on the
  bed, to humour me, moving your lips gently over my stiffness, back and forth,
  one or two inches at a time, tasting the saltiness, the soft texture. Then
  more vigorously, then removing your head and licking along the sensitive underside,
  then back in your mouth. 
My voice becomes softer, gentler. �That's good, Pia. Keep working.� 
�I'm so sorry� you whisper, for the first time, and resume your soft work. 
We both know what this means. It is an apology for your having resisted. 
Although still in pain, you become more active, clasping round the cock with
  your lips, putting all of your feminine art and guile into this special act
  of submission. I become harder and soon again take things into my own hands.
  I hold both sides of your head and push further in, against the back of your
  mouth, then down into your throat. This is challenging for you; you must withstand
  this peremptory intrusion, hold out. I start fucking your throat deeply, producing
  the gagging reflex. I fuck harder and harder and soon I start coming deep down
  your throat. Still coming I pull my cock back, shooting in your mouth and then
  out, the last spurt stringing over your left cheek. I push my cock back in
  and rest a moment, luxuriating in the warmth and wetness of your mouth. Then
  I speak again. �You may swallow the semen now.� You swallow. �Lick my cock
  clean!� After a couple of recuperative breaths you delicately clean my cockhead
  with your tongue. 
We lie together now. Your hands are now freed. Your nipples have stopped bleeding.
  I swab them delicately with antiseptic, and kiss you again tenderly, and hug
  you. 
�You know, Pia, I am your tormentor but I am also your protector, your lover
  and your friend� I say softly. I hold your head and gaze deeply and lovingly
  into your eyes. �You have very beautiful eyes. Together with your flowing blonde
  hair they give you an invigorating air of freshness.� 
I kiss you gently on the lips. Although your nipples are still stinging, the
  kiss has an effect on you and them, and you again start to melt, this time
  in my arms. Lying beside you, my fingers gently trace down the outside of your
  forearm while I am talking to you, kissing you, caressing you. 
�You are progressing well. It is just a beginning, but a beginning is half
  the act, is it not? You, yourself will, in the near future, clamour to be allowed
  into my land of green pastures, my land of your fulfilment, my warm, comfortable,
  safe, summer-perfumed erotic paradise. The struggles for identity that have
  been tearing your mind apart are far worse than the physical tortures I am
  inflicting on you. Only when you calmly, decidedly and irreversibly enter the
  Nirvana of total abandon to me, will this inner torment cease. Then you will
  have attained complete and final contentment.� 
You are absorbing this. But the night is now mature and we are tired. I am
  holding you, comforting you, we are simply together, and you drift safely off
  to sleep.
