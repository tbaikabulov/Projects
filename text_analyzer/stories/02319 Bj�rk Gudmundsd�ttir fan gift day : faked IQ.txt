Synopsis: Bj�rk realise that her true IQ is the lowest one that exist after taking IQ tests for fans. She end up humiliated the worst way possible. Bj&ouml;rk Gudmundsd&oacute;ttir fan gift day
      :  faked IQ   
   
After shared reflexion, Bj&ouml;rk came to the conclusion
  that her new "fan gift day" could be about something else than sex. Sex remind
  the best thing, the one thing that drive her nuts and make her think, but there's
  more to life than this. "Who knows, maybe some people care about my thoughts...",
  suggest to herself a deliriously naive Bj&ouml;rk.  
Inquiries from fans for the first edition of the "fan gift
  day" are rapidly flying in the Office of Elektra records. Most are too ridiculous
  to even be considerate : "I would like Bj&ouml;rk to marry me!", "I want Bj&ouml;rk
  to collaborate with Micheal Jackson", "What about a porno movie soundtrack
  for a movie in which she plays a bimbo singer?", "Bj&ouml;rk in playboy under
  the title 'A pixie that just want to be a pussy!' ", "Bj&ouml;rk should do
  an album all by herself", etc.  
Thinking of giving up, Bj&ouml;rk team is starting to receive
  more interesting, realistic suggestions and wishes : " I would be happy if
  Bj&ouml;rk accepted to act like a 2 years old for a whole year. Seeing my favourite
  icelandic singer limited to her child side would make me love her even more!
  It's what she does best, no?, "My fav singer exposing her personal diary or
  most private thoughts for several hours, in a series of features would be nice.,
  Doing an album in collaboration with me. I just bought these music softwares.
  Anybody can use them.", "Limit yourself to singing children music written for
  by real musicians", "Let your instinct control your mind. My inquiry is abstract,
  but i'm sure you know what i mean. You're almost there anyway..", "Realise
  your fans music ideas", "Show your fans what you've got in the head. You're
  a strong, independant woman who have a lot of new ideas? Then, your IQ is probably
  really big! Several fans signed this paper to see Bj&ouml;rk take several tests.
  The results should be sent to all the postal adresses bellow. We expect the
  best results, nothing less. Bj&ouml;rk is a genius!"  
The last letter was the choice. Close second was the one
  year contract limiting the small woman to the intellect of 2 years old. Bj&ouml;rk
  herself, really loved the idea of being infantilised. Isn't that ironic?  
Soon, the most respected specialists were hired to analyse
  the way Bj&ouml;rk's intellect worked. Several new innovative technologies
  were used. Taking care of impossible tasks like evaluating the level of creativity,
  concentration in the best possible situations, these techniques could really
  nailed down the quality of Bj&ouml;rk most talked about, but little known cells.  
The regular IQ tests, were then used as a back up tool,
  just in case something went wrong with the hi-tech ressources. Taking all the
  tests, answering all types of questions about all human discoveries, Bj&ouml;rk
  really did it all to please her fans.  
Bj&ouml;rk brain   
After several delays dominated by heavy doubts, all of the
  scientists came to the conclusion that the final results were ready and impossible
  to deny. Bj&ouml;rk was invited to look at them. Unconfortable, confused, the
  cast of the labo looked at a smiling Bj&ouml;rk with scared, deeply serious
  eyes. "Sooo....Bj&ouml;rk? Ugh! Ugh! Weeee have created a com...pl...ee...t
  pro...ugh! ugh! analyse of your brain. Here-it-is" ; then the malaise of the
  intelligentsia caused by the extreme truths was liberated with a video...  
"Bj&ouml;rk's brain is a mistake of nature! Everything about
  it is wrong!! The blood circulation throught the cells is painfully slow. The
  paths taken by any kind of information in this brain are overly complicated,
  long and completly irregulars ; nothing even make sens about them. The space
  between the cells is so thin that it often block the blood and create deep
  and expansive (getting worst with the age) thought interruptions. These interruptions
  are also encouraged by a natural lack of electrical flow in the brain. All
  human brains got a minimal set of features like a steady electrical flow, cells
  of a certain size, regular activation of all parts in the brain, a pro-active
  frontal lobe, and a superior overall weight. Bj&ouml;rk's brain doesn't have
  any of these features!! Instead, it work by accident. Occasional electrical
  shocks provocate some kind of thought that the subject can't really be aware
  of. Uneven cells (some are too broken to work, others are half-functional,
  but most are just plain absent) can allow a few parts of the brain to work.
  It's why several Bj&ouml;rk's brain sections have never been activated and
  never will be. On a certain level, all of these problems could be covered by
  a superior frontal lobe capacity. Unfortunatly, the frontal lobe examinated
  (in all kinds of activities), is rarely activated and when it is, it's accidental,
  totally random. The worst caracteristics are related to the brain weight which
  is much lighter than normal human brains. Near the status of a gorilla intellect,
  Bj&ouml;rk is obviously "the dumbest human being on earth." The fact that this
  woman is able to talk and read is some wonder! Somehow, Bj&ouml;rk was able
  to push her "habilities" to the maximum."  
Completly pissed off, angry and out of control, Bj&ouml;rk
  screamed the loudest way possible, like a wild gorilla, to show her frustrations."You
  got to have the worst jokes ever in your field!!" Call me when you have something
  to tell me...", she replicated to people so convinced of their studies that
  they just couldn't even think seriously of calling back Bj&ouml;rk ; talking
  to this "person" was not serious anymore, for any rational human being.  
To calm her down, friends directed her to toward the IQ
  tests, the old fashion tools.  
For the first test, based on 10 mathematics questions, 10
  sciences questions, 7 langages questions and 3 general knowledge questions,
  Bj&ouml;rk got 0/30. For the second test, based on 5 mathematics questions,
  10 sciences questions, 10 langages questions and 5 general knowledge questions,
  Bj&ouml;rk got 0/30. For the third, test, based on opened, creative questions,
  Bj&ouml;rk was penalised for writting too much incoherent giberish, and ended
  up at -30/30. It was a new low for this exercise given to young childrens for
  basic knowledge evaluation. The average for this test was 20/30. For a fourth
  test, based on general logic, Bj&ouml;rk was described as having "no logic
  at all", a status that the test creators only added to complete the "perfectly
  logic" grade! And it goes on...  
Bj&ouml;rk brain?   
Thinking of an organised manipulation, Bj&ouml;rk called
  up for new examinations of her intellect, by other people, with the previously,
  voluntarary avoided values for "concentration", "creativity" and the new option "social
  status according to your brain quality". All IQ tests were avoided this time.
  Bj&ouml;rk wouldn't want to go through all this work again. So sure that the
  next results would be the "good ones", Bj&ouml;rk accepted to send the soon-to-come
  statistics about her mind to her fans.  
"Bj&ouml;rk's brain got the most inferior quality for a
  human being. It can barely handle education, any sort of intellectual work,
  thinking with an obvious direction. Switched on and off like a bad electrical
  installation, Bj&ouml;rk's brain is always unsure, painfully slow and pretty
  useless. Like the primitives, monkeys and gorillas, Bj&ouml;rk is a curious,
  intriguing creature, but "it" share only a few things with real evolved humans.
  The thing that make it talk and read is the nature of the active cells. The
  thing that make it lack any sens of rythm and physical hability, confort (Bj&ouml;rk
  is known for touching herself almost continuously like she's been giving her
  body for the first time and is unsure whether or not it fits : http://www.anecdotage.com/index.php?aid=1947),
  out of goofy walk and dance, is the damaged cells. These same cells are healty
  in most animals heads. Somehow, Bj&ouml;rk is smarter than most animals. Somehow,
  she is dumber. Her concentration is the one of a senil goldfish (&quot;She
  can't sit still. She has the attention span of a senil goldfish.&quot; already
  recognised a hotpress journalist). Her creativity can only be imitation. With
  this brain quality, the subject should be retrograded to a domestic pet. We
  strongly recommend, that the subject is keep caged in the labo for further
  science developpements : Bj&ouml;rk might be the first known case of human
  devolution."  
Destroyed, just like her friends of the past and fans of
  the past by the news, Bj&ouml;rk nearly got a nervous breakdown. Then, she
  heard that the first examinations and all the IQ tests results have been published
  by Icelandic governement in newspapers. "We've been convinced by arguments
  of several specialists : the world most retarded human lifeform (it just can't
  be called a person anymore) is icelandic and is a celebrity! It can look like
  negative press for our country, but it's not. Bj&ouml;rk can make a great freak
  of nature. This thing will attract several tourists and make Icelandic famous!",
  written out the president of Iceland.  
Too dumb to notice that you fake it   
   
Hiding herself to keep people from capturing the nut case,
  Bj&ouml;rk rapidly lose all her fans, friends. It became a fact of life that
  Bj&ouml;rk was a laughable curiosity. So much that Bj&ouml;rk herself slowly
  started to think that it might be true : "The fact that i don't realise it,
  only prove it."  
Years later, now sure of the exceptional, abnormal low IQ
  that guide her, Bj&ouml;rk figure out something for the first time in her entire
  life : she've been totally dominated by her smart friends. Her IQ has been
  faked, built from A to Z. It took the medical approach to break the illusion.  
Bj&ouml;rk now remember real interventions of her intellect
  in the past. It's the opposite of the famous Bj&ouml;rk : &quot;My lovers are
  friends before all. Friends I can sleep with from time to time. I have never
  asked myself too many questions.&quot; (lesinrockuptibles ) , &quot;If a doctor
  would measure me, he would think I would have to have sex three times a day.&quot; (details
  of 1995), &quot;Luckily I'm so stupid that I don't realise why. The only way
  I can explain it is that I was in the right place at the right time.&quot; (smashhits), &quot;Don't
  blame me, I'm just an idiot foreigner.&quot; ( dotmusic ), &quot;I'd be lying
  if I wouldn't admit that I realized in a lot of things I'm a bit, sort of,
  stupid and slow. And it takes me about, kind of like, 10 years later than my
  fellow girlfriends in, kind of like...finding out about certain things, and...I
  would basicly say that, you know, I'm a bit, sort of stupid and a bit sort
  of slow, you know, and... I think it's lot to do with my...inability to..take
  in and learn about things with my brain. I kind of have to do it with my senses,
  is kind of all I got, really. And when you do things like that it takes ages,
  you know. And I, for example #like#, no way I can drive a car. I had a car
  for one year and I think I crashed it, sort of&hellip;twice a month. And it's
  just to clever for me, you know, it's got no logic for me  .&quot; (s
  wedishtv)  
 
  Bj&ouml;rk suddenly remember the recent deterioration of her brain, after a
  memory blockage during a few years (the thought interruptions problem is getting
  worst with the age) :   
&quot;And your reading just goes down the toilet. You start
  off reading highly spiritual, good-for-the-brain things and by the end I'm
  just reading about fucking and sex orgies.&quot; (Q, 1994), &quot;You can have
  like a sex orgy with dogs.&quot; ( sodamag), &quot;It's not meant to be a strife,
  it's not meant to be a struggle uphill you're trying too hard, surrender, give
  yourself in, you're trying too hard, you're trying too hard [...], it's warmer
  now lean into it, unfold in a generous way, surrender, surrender, undo&quot; (Bj&ouml;rk &quot;Undo&quot;,
  from &quot;Vespertine&quot; - 2001), &quot;i am strong in his hands, i am beyond
  me, on my own i'm human, and i do faults [...], i turn myself in, i give myself
  up, volunteer, you own me : i'm yours, you have to trust it, i'm eternally
  yours, all that i gave them, i gave to you, so needy of comfort, but too raw
  to be embraced, undo this privacy, and put me in my place.&quot; (Bj&ouml;rk &quot;Generous
  Palmstroke&quot;, from Vespertine - 2001) .  
True Bj&ouml;rk = brainless bimbo   
All of her fans of the past don't even remember the name
  Bj&ouml;rk when the animal decide to reinvent itself as the "brainless bimbo
  singer". Happy with the commercial sucess, it can't see that all the people
  that hated the previously-thought human for so long are laughing at the freak.
  Doing everything in their power to provocate Bj&ouml;rk exposure, they transform
  a sex object into a professionnal humiliating jokes subject for talk-shows.
  Being seen by law as public domain with no human or even animal rights, Bj&ouml;rk
  is kept naked and humiliated all day long. She's asked questions like these
  : "So, what do you want to do with your life, brainless?", "Do you know how
  to think?", "Do you like to be dumb?", "We've heard that you almost accepted
  to live like a 2 years old for a whole year. Science tells us now, that it
  would be a step forward for you?", "So, you are useless isn't it so?". She's
  answering, smiling and proud of her status : "I dunno anything. I would love
  to fuck you now.", "mmm... I dunno anything :)", "Do you think it's good to
  be dumb? It would really help me to have your advice. Because, i dunno...", "It's
  too hard to act like a 2 years old. I'm not that evolved :)", Bj&ouml;rk then
  giggles like the biggest slut, "Yeps!! I'm completly useless :) This is all
  i know...I can't understand the 101 uses for a Bj&ouml;rk  videos.
  This is stupid. Not like me, but...I'm sorry, my brain is dead now."
