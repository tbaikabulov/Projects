Julie�s Story 

 

By Dr. Quirt 

 

A young woman doesn�t quite realise just what she has let herself in for when she decides to 
explore her masochistic tendencies. The learning path is hard and long but, in the end, she 
becomes contented with her lot. 

 

This story is the first of a trilogy, the second and third parts being �Nina�s Tale� and �What 
Happened to Lucy?� 

 

 

Beginnings 

 

A light rain was beginning to fall from a leaden sky as the train pulled in to the station of the 
grimy, northern town. Julie was wondering just what she had let herself in for as she 
prepared to disembark. 

 

It had all started a few weeks before. After a number of failed relationships she had been 
wondering what to do with her life. It surely wasn�t her physical appearance that was at fault 
� she was an attractive, 24-year old, 5ft 8in blonde with a figure and legs to die for � no, it 
was probably that she had slightly abnormal tendencies when it came to the physical aspects 
of relationships and her demands tended to frighten away potential partners. It was quite easy 
to find someone who was willing to give her a good spanking but Julie needed more than that 
� so much more than that! 

 

She had just about exhausted the possibilities of finding a like-minded partner in her home 
town. Relationships at work were a bit of a no-no and the singles bars had not turned up 
anything worthwhile either. So, she had started to surf the internet and had come across an 
interesting contact in one of the chat rooms to which she subscribed. This particular person 
was looking for someone who was �completely sexually uninhibited and willing to participate 
in obedience training�. Julie knew that this description was just a euphemism for �sex slave� 
and although she was fully aware of the risks involved, she thought �what the hell� and 
provided her personal details. And then heard nothing more. 

 

She had completely forgotten about the matter when, one day, a plain, brown envelope came 
through her letterbox. It contained a first class rail ticket, to a place that she had vaguely 
heard of, and some additional information and instructions. If she was agreeable to the 
proposal she was to follow the instructions exactly and, if not, she was to return the ticket and 
would hear no more. 

 

The proposer, who wished to be known as �Master� was offering her long-term 
accommodation, should she prove suitable, in return for the provision of certain services. 
These would be of a disciplinary and sexual nature and would be explained to her fully if she 
decided to take up the offer. She was to catch a certain train on a certain date and would be 
met at the station. She would be identifiable because she would be barefoot. 

 

Julie noted that the date mentioned was two weeks away, which would give her little time to 
get her affairs in order if she decided to go. Giving it some thought, she decided to go for it. 
She put her flat in the hands of a letting agent and arranged to take some leave that was 



owing to her. If the arrangement looked as if it might become long-term then she could 
always resign her job � which wasn�t much of a job anyway. She told her few friends that 
she was going on holiday for a few weeks. 

 

As the day approached, Julie was uncertain what to take with her � she thought that, because 
of the nature of the offer, she wouldn�t need much in the way of clothing � and she didn�t 
really know what to wear for the journey. And what was this �barefoot� business? In the end 
she just took one small bag with a few spare t-shirts and undies and her personal stuff. She 
decided to wear jeans and a white t-shirt with no bra � with her high, firm breasts she didn�t 
really need one anyway. Not really fancying the barefoot idea that much she wore a pair of 
trainers. 

 

 

Arrival 

 

After a lengthy journey, she eventually arrived at her destination. It was raining and cold and 
the platform was wet and dirty so she kept her trainers on. Taking her bag, she got off the 
train, walked up the platform to the exit and went to the booking hall, where she was to be 
met. There were several people there but no-one seemed to be interested in her. She began 
to think that she had come all that way for nothing. 

 

After 30 minutes had passed she began to wonder what had happened � she thought about her 
instructions and about anything that she might have missed. She had definitely got the date 
right and the train had been a bit late so whoever was meeting her should have been there. 
Then she suddenly realized what the problem might be � she was not barefoot � and quickly 
removed her trainers. Almost immediately she was approached by a distinguished-looking 
gentleman. 

 

�Hello, you must be Julie. I am the Master. You will not be needing those,� � pointing to her 
trainers � �so dispose of them now. I have a car waiting outside.� 

 

Julie reluctantly threw her trainers into the nearest waste-bin and followed the Master through 
the doors and outside the station. They walked across the gravel-surfaced car park (Ouch!) to 
his car � a top model BMW. 

 

The journey to the Master�s house was quite long, travelling along winding country roads and 
soon Julie had no idea where she was. Eventually, they turned into a long, winding drive, 
accessed through remotely operated gates and pulled up outside an imposing Georgian 
residence. Throughout the journey, the master had said nothing and Julie likewise, but now 
he invited her into the house through the ornate entrance-way. 

 

Once inside, they passed through an impressive hallway and into a receiving room. 

 

�You have had a long journey and I�m sure that you would like some refreshments. Tea and 
cakes OK?� 

 

Over the tea and cakes the Master began to explain the situation. 

 

�You are here to be trained in obedience and I am sure that you know just what that means. 
You will obey my instructions immediately and completely and without question. Failure to 



obey or failure to provide a satisfactory service will result in immediate punishment. Minor 
infractions will be dealt with on the spot. Anything major will entail a visit to the Correction 
Centre, where we have a variety of equipment for dealing with recalcitrant guests. I can offer 
you long-term accommodation here. All your meals, etc. will be provided and you will have 
no expenses. On occasion, I shall expect you to provide a service to any colleagues that may 
visit me here. 

 

If you agree to these arrangements then we can proceed immediately. If not, I will take you 
back to the train station now � you will need to wait around for a while as the next train does 
not leave until morning. 

 

Your decision, please.� 

 

Although a little nervous by now, Julie thought that she had little to lose. 

 

�How many girls do you have here, right now? 

 

�You are the only one here at present.� 

 

�And if I agree, how long will I be here.� 

 

�As I said, I can offer you permanent accommodation but I would expect you to be here for a 
minimum of three months as this is the time it usually takes to complete basic training. After 
this, you may wish to stay or to move on to other things � there are a variety of options that 
we can discuss at the time.� 

 

�OK then, I agree.� 

 

�You are certain? This is your last opportunity to leave.� 

 

�I agree.� 

 

�Right then, follow me. You can leave your bag here. I will remove your personal items for 
your use and the other things can be stored as you will not be needing them.� 

 

 

Cold and Wet 

 

The Master then led Julie from the room, into a long passageway, which was, at first, 
carpeted, but in its further reaches was floored with stone flags. The floor felt cold under her 
bare feet. They arrived in a largish room that seemed to be a kitchen. There was an Aga 
cooking range as well as a large table and several chairs. A dresser was well equipped with 
crockery of all sorts. 

 

�Right, strip completely and place your clothes on the table � now!� 

 

This did not take long as Julie was only wearing three items and one of those was a very 
skimpy pair of panties. 

 

�Now remove any jewellery, hair clips or other items and place them with your clothes.� 



 

Julie removed her ear-rings and wrist-watch � she had nothing else - and now stood 
completely naked in front of the Master. 

 

�Now you will go outside into the grounds to contemplate what is about to happen to you. 
Return here in exactly one hour and I advise you to be on time.� 

 

�But I have no watch � how will I know when to come back?� 

 

�That is not my problem and I say again, be on time � neither early nor late or it will be the 
worse for you.� 

 

He then took Julie by the arm and led her to a door, which led to the outside. While they had 
been talking it had grown fully dark, the rain had intensified and the wind had got up, making 
it a really unpleasant evening. 

 

�Does he really expect me to be outside in this weather?� she wondered. 

 

The answer was obviously �yes� because she was pushed through the door into the courtyard. 

�One hour exactly � do not be early or late� was the last thing she heard as the door shut 
behind her. 

 

Now she was really wondering just what she had let herself in for � all those questions that 
she should have asked but hadn�t. She was soon cold and wet and started to cry � and she 
had no idea what time it was. 

 

Eventually, she pulled herself together a bit and started to look for somewhere to shelter � 
there really was nowhere though and it was too dark to see much. There were plenty of trees 
around but walking in the woods in the pitch dark didn�t seem such a good idea once she had 
tripped over some roots and fallen heavily. Then there was the occasional break in the cloud 
and the rain started to ease, the moon broke through and she could see a little more. The 
grounds of the house seemed to be quite extensive and she could see the house and another 
building, some way off. Was this the Correction Centre, she wondered? She thought that she 
could hear dogs howling in the distance � she shivered. 

 

The main house seemed to be surrounded by a gravel courtyard, which was quite hard on her 
feet, so she didn�t try to walk very far. Eventually she found herself at the main door, where 
she had entered the house. She still had no idea of the time but decided to risk it, climbed the 
steps up to the door, and pulled the bell cord. There was no response so she pulled it again 
and, eventually, heard footsteps from within. The door opened and the Master was there. 

 

�How dare you come to this door uninvited? Go immediately to the servants� door � be 
quick!� 

 

The door closed. 

 

�Servants� door � he must mean the kitchen door.� 

 

Julie carefully felt her way round the outside of the house. The sky had clouded over once 
more and the rain was falling more heavily than ever. She started to cry again. 



 

The little journey took some time but, at last, she found the right door and knocked. The door 
opened and there was the Master with an evil-looking quirt in his right hand. 

 

 

Late 

 

�You are ten minutes late and I don�t want to hear excuses. You have earned a punishment 
for this. Come inside � now!� 

 

The cold, wet, shaking, naked girl entered the house. All of her things seemed to have been 
removed but, otherwise, all was as before. 

 

�Right! I am now going to give you a small taste of what will happen to you if you do not 
obey my instructions exactly. As you are new here I am disposed to be lenient with you on 
this occasion � and only on this occasion. For each minute that you were late you will 
receive one stroke of this quirt on your buttocks and on the back of you thighs. I shall not 
restrain you but, if you attempt to thwart me in any way, I shall double the punishment. You 
will count the strokes and, if you lose count, we shall start again. Now bend over that table � 
now!� 

 

Julie, who was now quaking with fear, laid herself over the table edge. She could feel the 
hard wood digging into her hip bones. 

 

�Spread your legs � now!� 

 

She spread her legs and waited. 

 

The first stroke fell centrally across her buttocks and it was agony. Julie screamed but the 
pain was so intense that she forgot to count. 

 

�OK, we start again.� 

 

By the third stroke she couldn�t stand it any more and reached back with her hand to stop the 
quirt. Bad move! 

 

�OK, you were warned. Your punishment is now doubled and I am going to restrain you.� 

 

He quickly tied her ankles to the legs of the table and dealt with her wrists in a similar way. 
Then the punishment began again, in earnest. Julie screamed and screamed and sometimes 
forgot to count. She had received 45 strokes to her bum and thighs and, at the finish, they 
were covered in red welts. The skin had not been cut though � the Master was an expert. 

 

�I hope that you enjoyed that,� he said to the sobbing girl. �That�s just a small taste of what 
you can expect for disobedience and, unfortunately for you, I haven�t quite finished yet. 
There is the small matter of not obeying you joining instructions properly � remember the 
trainers that you were supposed not to wear � and I shall give you ten strokes for that. And 
there have been several instances where you have not addressed me properly as Master. In 
future, each omission will earn you ten strokes but, as I am disposed to be lenient, I shall 
award you ten more strokes for the total of your omissions, making twenty more strokes in 



total. As your bum and thighs have been well serviced already tonight I shall thrash your 
back. Don�t forget to count will you?� 

 

�No � Mmmaster.� 

 

�Good, you are learning.� 

 

And the Master then applied his quirt to Julie�s back and shoulders. In the end she received 
only 5 extra strokes for losing count, by which time her back was covered in bright red stripes 
� but no blood. 

 

He left her there for an hour to enjoy her pain. 

 

After what seemed a long time the Master returned. 

 

�I�m sure that you must be feeling hungry and thirsty so I am going to prepare some food for 
us. You will not know this but I used to be a Cordon Bleu chef in my younger days. No 
Cordon Bleu today though so I shall make us a little stir fry. And, by the way, I don�t cook 
breakfast. That is one of your jobs � I trust that you can do bacon and egg?� 

 

�Yyyeesss, Master.� 

 

And the Master cooked up some stir fry and opened a bottle of wine and, having released the 
girl, they sat down to a companiable meal. All might have seemed quite normal had the girl 
not been stark naked with her back, bum and thighs covered in red welts. 

 

�Perhaps you had better use this cushion � it might make things a bit less uncomfortable. If 
you think that I have been harsh with you today it is only because I like to start out in the 
manner in which I intend to continue. You have learned some valuable lessons in obedience 
today but, believe me, what you have experienced is only a very small fraction of what you 
may well be expected to endure in the future. You need to realise that I am a sadist and will 
take great pleasure in inflicting pain on your naked, defenceless body if you give me the least 
excuse. So far as sex is concerned, I find that difficult owing to an injury that I sustained a 
few years ago, so I cannot always oblige. I have a variety of toys that I can use on you that 
should keep you satisfied but I am sure that you will derive a great deal of pleasure from 
being physically punished � otherwise, why are you here? Any questions, so far?� 

 

�Master, where will I be quartered while I am here?� 

 

�Yes, I�m glad that you asked that. I shall show you to your room when we have finished 
eating. It�s getting late and I have already taken your personal things there.� 

 

 

Cold and Dark 

 

After the meal, the master led Julie from the kitchen up some flights of stone stairs to a 
corridor on the second floor. Julie�s first impression was of a dank, cold feeling. 

 

�We have several apartments up here but they are all identical so this one is as good as any of 
the others.� 



 

He pushed open a door and ushered Julie into a small, bare room. The only item of furniture 
was a double bed and that had no mattress, only a base with exposed wire springs and 
restraints attached to each corner. The floor was just bare boards. 

 

�I should explain to you that, while you are here, this is where you will sleep. You will sleep 
naked and restrained. You are not allowed clothing of any kind whatsoever � you will be 
totally and absolutely naked at all times. You will also remove all of your body hair. There 
is a bathroom at the end of the corridor � your personal effects are there. You will use the 
facilities to keep yourself clean and you may observe that no towels are provided � you will 
be naked always! And, by the way, I�m sorry if you find it a bit cold and damp up here but 
this part of the house is not equipped with heating. You will get used to it. Now, as your 
backside may be feeling a little tender, you will be restrained face down tonight. Get on the 
bed and spread your legs and arms � now!� 

 

�Yes Master, immediately Master.� 

 

And Julie was duly restrained on the wire bed base. The restraints were pulled so as to 
stretch her very tightly. The wire base dug into her breasts and thighs and she was really not 
very comfortable � which was the whole point, really. 

 

The Master left Julie spread-eagled on the bed, thinking about what tomorrow might bring. 
Her back, bum and legs were still very sore but soon she had something else to worry about. 
The room was really cold and she soon needed to pee. And the need didn�t go away � it just 
got worse until she just had to let go. Her pee trickled through the wire base and made a nice 
puddle on the floor. And that is how the Master found her in the morning. 

 

 

Morning 

 

She knew that morning was close because a dim, grey light was filtering through the un-
curtained window. She lay there shivering, having no option, until, eventually the Master 
appeared, quirt in hand. 

 

�You filthy whore! You�re no better than an animal. Ten strokes and then you can clean it 
up!� 

 

Ten strokes of the quirt were duly applied to her already smarting backside, making her 
scream in agony, and then she was released. 

 

�Clean this filth up and then clean yourself up and hurry. I need my breakfast and your 
training starts today!� 

 

�But Master, I have nothing to clean with � no cloths, no towels.� 

 

�And you will not have! You can use your hair as a mop � it�s long enough. Do a good job � 
otherwise we shall have an appointment at the Correction Centre!� 

 

Julie spent the next 30 minutes desperately trying to mop the floor with her hair, which was 
soon not its usual honey blonde colour � more a shade of dirty grey. She was relieved to find 



that her shampoo and shower gel were in the bathroom and felt a little better after a good 
wash. But how those welts did sting! 

 

She went down to the kitchen, still soaking wet, to be greeted by another two slashes of the 
quirt for being too slow. Then she had to make the bacon and egg breakfast � and clean up 
from the night before. Luckily, the breakfast passed muster and at least she was not so 
hungry now. 

 

 

Training 

 

�Today we�ll start by looking at some of the facilities here � not the Correction Centre 
though, that will wait for a more opportune moment, which I�m sure will not be long coming. 
Afterwards, I will explain the basics of your training programme and we will make a start on 
some of the easier positions.� 

 

�Positions? What?� thought Julie, but did not dare say anything. 

 

The Master showed her the main training room. This was a room equipped with several 
chairs and sofas, as well as a vaulting horse and a caning stool. What struck Julie 
immediately was the number of glass-fronted cabinets around the walls, each containing a 
variety of whips, crops, canes and similar implements. 

 

�This is really more of a punishment room for minor infractions. The majority of training is 
carried out in the courtyard, unless the weather is really atrocious.� 

 

�Like yesterday, Master?� 

 

�What? I mean when the temperature is well below zero and we�re having driving sleet. 
Yesterday was summer!� 

 

�What is in the Correction Centre, Master?� 

 

�You will probably find out soon enough � and then you�ll wish that you hadn�t!� 

 

They did a Cooke�s tour of the rest of the large house, most of which was under dust sheets 
and clearly not used very much. Then it was training time. 

 

�The object of your training, as well as teaching you obedience, is to improve your physical 
flexibility so that you can achieve many different sexual positions. You may have read the 
Kama Sutra and wondered if all of the positions described were possible. I can assure you 
that they are and you will learn every one � and more besides. We shall start with position 
number one, which is a very easy, face down, spread-eagle. The object is to get your legs as 
far apart as possible while your arms are held at right-angles to your body. Position number 
two is identical but face-up. I shall encourage you to spread your legs in an appropriate 
manner. Come, to the courtyard!� 

 

She might have known it � it was raining again and cold with it. The Master, of course, wore 
his waterproof jacket. She was totally naked. 

 



�Lie down there�, pointing to the gravel floor, �and spread your legs wide � now!� 

 

The sharp gravel dug into her breasts and thighs. 

 

�Wider!� 

 

A few strokes of the quirt on her inner thighs encouraged her to spread wider but the Master 
was not yet satisfied. 

 

�I want to see a wider spread than that pathetic attempt. You will stay there and practice this 
position. When I return I shall expect to see an improvement � if not you will be sorry!� 

 

She was left there, on the gravel, cold and wet and in some considerable discomfort for what 
seemed like a long time. She tried to improve her spread but without much success. 
Eventually, the Master returned. 

 

�Spread wide � now! Unsatisfactory!� 

 

The quirt came down viciously on her inner thighs. Julie screamed and tried to roll herself 
into a ball � the quirt came down on her naked back. 

 

�You have been warned about trying to thwart me and you will pay for this � but later. You 
can look forward to it. Now we shall take a short break before we try position number two.� 

 

They went back inside the house � Julie soaking wet, cold and in pain. After a cold lunch it 
was back outside into the cold and rain to practice position number two � face up this time 
and this was really painful to Julie�s already abused bum and back. Again she was 
encouraged to spread and again she was left there to practice for a long time. And again the 
result was unsatisfactory, gaining her some more strokes � this time across the front of her 
thighs and her stomach. At last she was allowed to go back inside to clean up � and warm up. 

 

�Your performance today has not been satisfactory. You are going to have to do much better 
if you want to avoid a trip to the Correction Centre. Tomorrow we shall start on two, more 
difficult positions and you had better co-operate. You�ll still have to practice today�s lessons, 
of course, as you have a long way to go before you are satisfactory on those.� 

 

By this time, Julie was thinking that a trip to the Correction Centre was probably inevitable. 
Heavens, the training today had been impossibly hard and this had only been an �easy� start. 
What on earth would tomorrow bring? 

 

�Now, I am going to punish you for thwarting me. Come with me � now!� 

 

 

Punishment 

 

He took her to the training room where he restrained her, face down, across the vaulting 
horse. Her legs were spread and tied to the legs of the horse � her arms likewise. She was 
totally at his mercy � and none would be shown. 

 

�I think that two dozen with this martinet would be appropriate.� 



 

He brandished a small, multi-tailed whip with eight rubber thongs, each about a foot long. 

 

�This little whip is made from rubber � it won�t cut you but it will be very painful. You can 
scream all you like � no-one will hear you. I am going to enjoy this � I don�t think that you 
will, though. And don�t forget to count!� 

 

The whip came down with a crack across the shoulders of the naked, quaking girl. She had 
never known pain like it � it felt like fire and it got worse with time. Just as the pain began to 
peak, the whip came down again. Had she remembered to count? She really couldn�t 
remember. The whip came down again and again and Julie screamed and screamed. When 
she eventually lost consciousness the entire backsides of her legs and body were covered in 
angry welts again. 

 

She came round some time after the punishment had stopped to find herself alone and still 
tied to the horse. Her body felt as if it was on fire but, slowly, the pain eased. After a while, 
the master returned and released her � she could hardly stand unaided and had to be helped 
back to the kitchen, where a meal had been prepared. 

 

�I hope that you have learned not to thwart me. If you try it again the result will be much 
worse for you. That little whip is merely a toy compared to some of the equipment that I 
have here. You are probably feeling very sore at the moment but be assured that no 
permanent damage has been done � let�s try to keep it that way. Now, eat your food. You 
need to keep your strength up because you have a long day�s training tomorrow. And I want 
to see better progress than today!� 

 

After the meal, Julie was taken back to her room for the night. This time, before she was 
restrained, face upwards, on the bed she remembered to visit the bathroom. She didn�t want a 
repetition of yesterday! Lying on her abused back was painful and, as she was stretched 
tightly, she couldn�t move around to ease the hurt. Eventually she fell asleep, waking just as 
dawn was breaking, feeling very cold and bursting for a pee. Fortunately, she managed to 
contain herself until the Master released her so there was no extra punishment this time. 

 

 

Training Again 

 

The day was much like the previous one had been, except that the weather was a little 
warmer. In addition to practicing positions one and two she was introduced to some more 
demanding positions but didn�t do very well, earning more than a few �encouragements�. At 
least she received no major punishment that day. 

 

Time passed � she lost track of the days and everything tended to become a blur. Some days 
were good, with only a few strokes awarded, but others, when she made no progress, were 
bad. On two occasions she had to endure the rubber whip again. 

 

Two positions, in particular, were causing her some trouble. One of these, position four, 
involved her kneeling with her legs spread wide and her shoulders and breasts on the ground. 
Her arms had to be held out from her sides at right-angles to her body. Her arse and genitals 
had to be projected backwards and completely exposed. She found it almost impossible to 
keep her balance and tended to fall over � each time earning a slash to her exposed cunt. The 



other �impossible� position, position five, required her to be on her back with her legs drawn 
up so that her ankles were behind her neck. She was still a long way off achieving this, 
despite �encouragement� to her exposed genitalia. 

 

Progress was slow � too slow � and one day, after a hard training session, the Master 
confronted Julie about this. 

 

�You have been here two weeks now� (had it really only been two weeks?) �and have made 
little progress with your training programme. I suspect that you are lazy and have a bad 
attitude. I am not prepared to put up with this and I want to see an immediate improvement � 
starting tomorrow. In order to encourage you I shall punish you severely tonight.� 

 

Julie quaked at hearing this but then, foolishly, lost her temper. 

 

�What do you expect? I try my best and I�m not double jointed, you know. I don�t want to 
stay here any more. I�ve had enough. Get me my things � I�m leaving!� 

 

The Master smiled. 

 

�Well now, I seem to remember an agreement that we had � something about an initial 3-
month period. Let�s see � that means that you have about another 11 weeks to go, by my 
reckoning. I also seem to remember something about correct forms of address and instant 
obedience. Not looking too good for you, is it?� 

 

�You can�t keep me here � I�m leaving!� 

 

�SIT DOWN AND BE SILENT! You are going nowhere. You have no clothes, no money, 
and no idea where you are. And if I release the hounds you won�t get as far as the main gate! 
All you have done, by this outburst, is to earn yourself a visit to the Correction Centre. You 
wanted to know what was in there so now you will find out. Come with me � now!� 

 

 

Correction 

 

He took her by the hair and dragged her outside into the courtyard. It was raining again! The 
Correction Centre was a little way off, down a path through the woods. It was the same 
building that she had glimpsed on her first night there. The Master unlocked a heavy door in 
the windowless structure and pushed Julie into a bare, concrete corridor. At the end of the 
corridor was a second, heavy door, leading into a large, concrete room. The Master switched 
on the harsh, overhead fluorescent lighting. 

 

The first impression that Julie had was that they were in a factory workshop � no home 
comforts here. The walls were concrete, the floor was concrete and there were several pieces 
of equipment dotted around. She realised, to her horror, that one of these was an old-
fashioned rack and another was a St. Andrew�s cross. Other pieces she did not recognise. 
What was that wheel-like structure that dominated the room and what were those cubicles 
that looked like shower stalls � and why did they have iron rings set into the floor? 

 

On the walls hung an immense variety of punishment implements � bullwhips, horsewhips, 
carriage whips, cat-o-nine tails, martinets, crops, canes, floggers, as well as some very 



sinister-looking metal instruments. There also seemed to be some electrical apparatus along 
one wall. 

 

�Impressive isn�t it? I had this centre built specially and at no little expense. Some of the 
equipment I designed myself and the whole building is double-skinned in foot-thick concrete. 
You could have a rock band playing at full power in here and you wouldn�t hear a thing 
outside these walls. Now, I am going to restrain you in the sluice overnight so that you can 
contemplate the error of your ways. In the morning I am going to whip you severely.� 

 

�Master, I am truly sorry. I will try harder so please don�t whip me.� 

 

�Begging for mercy will not help you � quite the reverse, in fact. You have just earned 
yourself 50% extra strokes.� 

 

�But � but �� 

 

�100% extra, plus ten for not addressing me correctly!� 

 

 

Sluice 

 

Julie�s heart sank � whatever she did only seemed to make things worse. What now and what 
was the sluice? She would soon find out. 

 

The Master took a metal collar from the wall and quickly slipped it around Julie�s neck. He 
then dragged her across to one of the �shower cubicles�, forced her to the ground and attached 
her collar to a metal ring in the floor with a very short chain. She maybe had six inches of 
movement. 

 

�You will spend the night here and we shall meet again in the morning � I look forward to it.� 

 

He then left the room, closing the door behind him and turning out the lights. Julie was left 
lying naked on the cold floor in total darkness. 

 

�But why is it called the sluice?� she thought. 

 

Her question was soon answered as jets of icy cold water suddenly erupted from vents in the 
walls of the cubicle, soaking her from head to foot. And then the diabolical design of the 
sluice became apparent. The water level rose until, at full stretch, she could just about keep 
her nose and mouth above its level. After a while the water jets ceased but the level only 
reduced a little � she still had to strain all of the time. Soon she was in agony from her 
cramped muscles. And that wasn�t the end of it � the whole process repeated itself at 30-
minute intervals throughout the long, long night. 

 

She completely lost track of time and when the Master returned it was almost a relief. The 
water level in the cubicle reduced to zero and her collar was unfastened. There was no 
danger of her getting away � the door was locked and, in any case, she was incapable of 
standing. 

 



�Good morning Julie. At least it�s a good morning for me � less good for you I think. Now 
we�ll proceed with your whipping � I hope that you�re ready for it � it will be quite an 
experience for you.� 

 

 

Wheel 

 

He attached metal bracelets to her ankles and wrists and dragged her across to the wheel-like 
structure that she had seen earlier. She was attached to the rim of the wheel by her restraints, 
legs and arms pulled wide apart. Her body was the wheel hub and her limbs were the spokes. 

 

�This apparatus I designed myself and had built specially. The outer rim of the wheel runs in 
bearings so that the whole apparatus, and you with it, can be rotated to any angle. All parts of 
your body are equally vulnerable and you will notice that there is ample space behind the 
wheel for you to be whipped from that side also. When I have finished there will not be a 
single square inch of your flesh remaining unscathed. Now, as to the number of strokes that 
you are to receive - initially, this was to have been 100 but, because of your foolishness, you 
will now get 210. Any tendency to beg should be avoided � each occasion will add ten more 
strokes � as I do not intend to show you any mercy whatsoever. As a small concession, I 
shall not require you to count the strokes and I shall only use a carriage whip on you, rather 
than a bull whip. You will get cut but nothing that will not heal nicely under my tender care. 
I used to be a doctor you know.� 

 

He selected a long carriage whip from the wall and cracked it smartly. Julie flinched. Then 
he started to apply it to her defenceless body � he started with her in an upright position and 
whipped her breasts and legs then slowly rotated the equipment until she had been whipped 
everywhere. When she was completely inverted he finished by whipping her genitals. 

 

Julie made an awful lot of noise from the beginning. Her life became a red sea of pain, pain 
and more pain. When her nipples were whipped it was just horrendous but when the tip of 
the whip contacted her clit it was even worse. She felt like it would never end but, at last, the 
strokes stopped coming. 

 

She was left in the wheel for the rest of that day and, when evening came, was taken down 
and put back into the sluice for the night. She was almost grateful for the ice-cold water as it 
eased the pain from her welts and cuts. It was hardly a comfortable night though. 

 

Morning eventually came, and with it the Master. 

 

�I shall give you the day off today � no training, just some light household duties. And I want 
to attend to any cuts that you might have � you don�t look too bad. I haven�t lost my 
expertise, I�m glad to say.� 

 

He took her back to the main house and stood her in front of a mirror so that she could see 
her body. She was shocked � there were welts everywhere, from wrists to feet and 
everywhere in-between but surprisingly few cuts. He applied some healing salve to those 
few cuts that she did have � more would be applied that night � and then set her to cooking 
breakfast. She was actually quite hungry, despite her ordeal, having had no food for 36 hours 
and only a little water to drink. She spent the remainder of the day doing a little dusting and 
cleaning. It was a bit painful to move around though. 



A New Start 

 

After that day, Julie decided to try a lot harder to please the Master. This was partly because 
she had no desire to visit the Correction Centre again but also because she realized that life 
might not be so bad after all. She was a masochist and had taken up the offer because she 
wanted to be punished regularly � she just didn�t want it to be taken to extremes. 

 

Her cuts healed rapidly and cleanly and she soon found herself actually enjoying her training 
sessions. She still received plenty of �encouragement� and still had difficulty with some 
positions but she was getting better. The Master was generally quite pleased with her and 
also started to use her sexually from time to time. She became quite contented with her lot. 

 

 

Sir 

 

A few weeks had passed when, one day, Julie received a summons to the Master�s study. She 
was surprised to find a second, elderly gentleman there and surmised that he must have 
arrived some time the previous evening, while she had been restrained in her room. 

 

�Julie, this is a colleague of mine who is visiting us for a day or two. You will afford him the 
same respect that you afford me and you will address him as �Sir�, you understand?� 

 

Julie knew that she should have felt embarrassed at being totally naked in front of a perfect 
stranger but, somehow, it all felt quite natural. She also knew what the penalty for not being 
polite was likely to be. 

 

�Yes Master, I understand. I am very pleased to meet you Sir and I am at your disposal.� 

 

�Good,� said Sir, �I like politeness in a slave. Turn round; I want a good look at your body. 
Now bend over and spread your legs.� 

 

At this point he inserted a finger into her vagina and spread her buttocks. 

 

�Mmm, not bad! I don�t see any scars � has she really been that good?� 

 

�Yes, in general she has been quite satisfactory. We had a little difficulty at first but that�s all 
behind us now.� 

 

�Really, well I think that I had better judge for myself just how effective the training 
programme has been. I would like to see her put through her paces. Come, slave!� 

 

He picked up a switch from the table and took Julie from the room and outside into the 
courtyard. The Master did not accompany them. No rain today but a cold wind was blowing. 

 

�Who is this person?� thought Julie, as they walked out. �He seems to have some sort of hold 
over the Master.� 

 

�Right slave! Show me position one � now!� 

 

�Yes Sir, at once, Sir.� 



Julie assumed the position and with a little encouragement achieved a really wide spread. Sir 
seemed pleased and they went on to explore a number of other positions. Then it all started 
to go wrong. 

 

�Position four � now!� 

 

This was a difficult one for Julie and, as was so often the case, she couldn�t maintain the 
position and fell over, earning herself a couple of strokes to the buttocks. 

 

�Not very good! Position five � now!� 

 

This was the bane of Julie�s existence � there was no way that she was ever going to get those 
ankles behind her neck! She tried, failed, and received six strokes to the backs of her thighs. 

 

�Unsatisfactory! How long have you been here, slave?� 

 

�Aaabbbout eight weeks, Sir.� 

 

�And this is the best that you can do? At this rate you will never be ready! We shall have to 
speed up the process, I think.� 

 

�Yes Sir, whatever you say, Sir�, silently thinking, �Ready? Ready for what?� 

 

He took her back to the Master. 

 

�Totally unsatisfactory! I cannot believe that she has been here for eight weeks already. I 
propose that I take her back to my establishment for a while � as you know, I have equipment 
there that can help with attaining some of the more difficult positions. Meanwhile, I think 
that she needs to be punished for her laziness. I suggest some time in the sluice and a 
thorough whipping tomorrow. I�ll take her away the next day and you can have her back 
when I�ve finished with her.� 

 

�Mmmaaaster?� 

 

�Be silent. That sounded suspiciously like begging to me � ten more lashes tomorrow! And 
now, to the sluice!� 

 

�So, she has not yet learned not to beg? I�ll add an additional ten to your ten so that�s twenty 
and I think 100 for the laziness � with the bull whip, naturally.� 

 

�No, I don�t want her scarred up, she hasn�t been that bad. I�ll use a driving whip on her � it 
will be painful enough.� 

 

Julie was really frightened now. How could they talk about her as though she were just a 
piece of meat? What on earth would happen at Sir�s establishment? 

 

So, to the sluice again. Sir demanded that she be hog-tied and that made things even more 
uncomfortable than before. It was a very long evening and night and in the morning, when 
they came for her, she could hardly move. She was strung up in the wheel, as before, and 
received her 120 strokes. It was excruciatingly painful, of course, and she screamed a lot but 



she couldn�t help but get the impression that the Master was holding back. There were no 
cuts this time either. 

 

�Well, if that�s the best that you can do I�m not surprised that little progress has been made. 
120 strokes with that little toy won�t achieve very much � and they were not hard strokes at 
that. Not the way I like to see things done, I can tell you!� 

 

They left her there for a few hours and then she was returned to the sluice for another 
uncomfortable night. The next morning she was gagged and, still hog-tied, was bundled into 
the back of a blacked out limousine. She didn�t get a chance to say goodbye to the Master. 

 

 

At Sir�s Establishment 

 

The journey seemed quite long and, of course, she had no idea where she was going. 
Eventually the car stopped and the rear door was opened. Blinking in the sudden light, Julie 
saw that they were in an underground garage. She was quickly bundled out of the car and 
carried down a passageway into a darkened room, the only light coming from the open 
doorway. She didn�t really have time to take in the dim view before a collar was slipped 
around her neck and was fastened to an iron ring in the floor with a very short chain. The 
door closed and she was left alone in the dark. 

 

How long she lay there, hogtied, she had no idea. She only knew that the floor was cold 
stone and that she needed to pee. Soon she was lying in her own filth. No-one came for a 
long time � nothing to eat � nothing to drink � in pain � she became completely disorientated. 

 

Eventually, the door opened and a bowl of water and another bowl of gruel-like stuff were 
pushed across the floor. The gag was removed but apparently she was expected to eat like a 
dog � not easy and she ended up licking some of it off the floor. Soon she had to pee again � 
and worse. Exhausted, she finally drifted off into an uneasy sleep. 

 

She was woken by the sensation of cold water all over her body. Someone � she couldn�t see 
who � was hosing her down. The hog-tie was removed but she remained chained to the floor. 
At least now she could feed herself on the bread and water that was given to her. Then it was 
back to being in the dark and, shortly, lying in her own pee again. 

 

She lost track of time � had she been there two days or two weeks? There was no way of 
telling. The food, what there was of it, appeared sporadically and the intervals between 
hosing seemed variable. One day she awoke to find the room flooded with bright light and 
Sir standing over her. 

 

�Well, I see that my staff have been treating you well, although I would have preferred the 
hog-tie to have been left on! I�ve been away for a few days but now, I�m back, so we can 
make a start on your training enhancements in the morning. Meanwhile, as you have not 
experienced the lash for a little while, I intend to put that matter right. We wouldn�t want you 
to forget what happens to disobedient, lazy slaves, would we now? I think two dozen with a 
tawse would be about right � and don�t wriggle too much or I might think that you are trying 
to thwart me and we both know what the result of that would be, don�t we? 

 



He picked up a heavy, leather strap from a table. The strap was about one foot long, plus its 
handle, and was split into three tongues. He tapped the tawse lightly on his hand and then 
brought it down with full strength on the body of the naked, defenceless girl. 

 

�Craack!� went the tawse. 

 

�Aaaaaggh!� went the girl, as her world exploded into pain. 

 

Of course, Julie could not avoid wriggling to try to avoid the tawse so her punishment was 
doubled. To cap it all, when she had received a dozen strokes she was reminded by Sir that 
she was supposed to be counting. 

 

�Had he actually said so?� she wondered, through a red mist of pain. 

 

So, she got a dozen, then another four dozen, then another dozen for losing count somewhere 
along the way � 72 strokes in all. She was covered in welts from shoulders to feet, back and 
front. Then Sir departed and she was left alone in the dark on the cold, stone floor � again � 
to spend a very uncomfortable night. 

 

Morning came, and with it came Sir, complete with some fairly unappetizing food � no 
Cordon Bleu chef here. 

 

�This morning I shall introduce you to the Position 4 apparatus. You have difficulty with 
position 4 and this equipment will help you. Use it to your advantage or suffer the 
consequences. I shall be on hand to offer encouragement.� 

 

Her collar was removed and she struggled to her feet for the first time in several days � it 
seemed like several weeks! She was then installed in the Position 4 apparatus. By dint of 
various clamps, ropes and pulleys this equipment was designed to spread the legs of the 
kneeling participant, exposing the genitalia, while maintaining the upper body flat on the 
ground with the arms outspread. The tension in the ropes could be gradually increased, 
forcing the legs further apart. Over the course of time, the tendons in the participant�s legs 
would be stretched, thus enabling a good spread to be achieved in the absence of the 
equipment. 

 

Of course, as her arse and genitals were totally exposed, while in this apparatus, Sir had no 
hesitation about offering �encouragement� with his switch and she received many strokes as 
the ropes were tightened. She spent several hours in Position 4 and then, it was time for 
Position 5. 

 

This equipment was similar in concept, using ropes and pulleys to pull the participants legs 
apart and up until the ankles could be locked behind the neck. Again, over the course of 
time, the tendons would become stretched sufficiently and the equipment would be no longer 
needed. And, of course, her genitals were, once again, totally exposed to Sir�s switch. 

 

Over the course of the next several days Julie tried to be as co-operative as possible because 
she knew what the consequences of non-co-operation would be. This did not entirely save 
her, however, and she received two substantial whippings for �not displaying enthusiasm�. 
Eventually, however, her performance was deemed satisfactory � she could now do positions 
four and five unaided, as well as all the others on which she had been trained. 



One day, after a particularly successful session, Sir, having released her from some 
equipment, informed her that her training at his establishment was complete. 

 

�Julie, you have done well here and there is little more that I can teach you. I think that you 
are about ready to go back to your Master. However, before you go, I would like to leave 
you with a little souvenir of your stay here, as I do for all slaves that pass through this 
establishment. Tonight, therefore, you will be restrained in the sluice � yes I have one too � 
and tomorrow you will receive 100 strokes of the bull whip. Hopefully, this will result in 
some permanent scarring so that you will always have reason to remember your time here. I 
don�t actually have a copy of that excellent wheel that your Master has but I�m sure that we 
can find an adequate substitute.� 

 

�But you have no right to do this! I am not your slave, I belong to my Master!� 

 

�And your Master is not here and I have the right to act �in loco parentis� and you have just 
doubled your punishment by your disrespectful behaviour. I should say no more, if I were 
you! I am minded to give you an extra 100 strokes but perhaps we will save those for your 
next visit.� 

 

Julie was appalled but, wisely, kept her mouth shut and was duly hog-tied in Sir�s sluice 
which, to all intents and purposes, was identical to the Master�s. Even the cold water jets 
were the same! 

 

The following morning she was strung up by the feet, legs pulled wide apart, arms pulled 
wide and secured to the floor, stretched tightly and then Sir whipped her mercilessly with a 
bull-whip. First the whip raised welts and then more welts on top of the first welts and then 
her skin broke and the blood began to flow. Welts everywhere, legs, breasts, arse, back, 
genitals � everywhere. She was a mess! 

 

She had never known pain like it � everything that had gone before was trivial compared to 
this. And Sir was an expert � he knew just how to time the strokes so that the pain would 
build and build. When she passed out he would wait for her to come to before continuing and 
the whipping went on and on. She had no idea of the number of strokes that she received � it 
was certainly at least the 200 promised but might well have been more. At last it stopped. 

 

She had a hazy recollection of being put back in the sluice but, the following morning, she 
could not stand and could not move. She was thrown, still bleeding, into the back of the 
limousine and, later, dumped unceremoniously onto the gravel of the Master�s courtyard � 
and that was where he found her, naked, bleeding and soaked through from the rain. 

 

 

Back at the Master�s House 

 

It was touch and go for a few days and Julie only had vague recollections of this time. One 
day she awoke to find herself back in her old room � still naked and still tied to the bed. The 
Master came to her. 

 

�I�m glad to see that you are awake at last � you�ve had quite an ordeal but you�re safe now. 
Sir is not here and I�m not expecting to see him in the near future. He should not have used a 
bull-whip on you but the extent of the punishment was largely your own fault. If you are 



disrespectful there is little that I can do. I�m afraid that you will have some permanent 
scarring from your whipping, which was his intention, I�m sure. I have done what I can but 
you were quite a mess when I found you. I�ll continue to treat your wounds but you will have 
to remain confined to your room, for now. Later, when you have recovered, we�ll continue 
with your training. 

 

The following few weeks she could do very little but gradually her body healed. The scarring 
wasn�t too bad really although she might have to think twice before appearing in a bikini on a 
public beach. Thankfully, her genitals were not permanently damaged, although she would 
not have wanted to have sex for some considerable time. 

 

In due course the training continued � it really was no problem to her now and her 
achievements surpassed both her and her Master�s expectations. One day, it must have been 
getting on for six months since she had first come there, the Master wanted to talk to her. 

 

�Well Julie, you have been here a long time now and I think that we have gone about as far as 
we can with your training. You now have to make a decision. You can either return to your 
former life, and I rather hope that you don�t want to do that, stay here, or take advantage of 
opportunities elsewhere. I am a member of a world-wide organization that is always looking 
for suitable people to train new slaves. I could get you a position in any one of a number of 
countries � no questions asked, my recommendation is enough. Alternatively, as I am 
wanting to expand my operation here, you could stay on as my assistant. You would still be 
subject to the same rules as before, of course, but you would be teaching the techniques to 
fresh girls coming here and you would, of course, be responsible for disciplining them 
appropriately. I�m hoping to have a new girl join us next week, if she turns up, so, what do 
you say? The decision is yours.� 

 

�Master, could I please have tonight to think about it? And Master, before I sleep tonight, 
would you please give me a serious whipping? I haven�t had a good session for a while now 
and I do miss being punished. I think two dozen with the driving whip would be about right 
and, if I should lose count �� 

 

�Julie, you are insolent and I think that you fully deserve to be whipped. Maybe two dozen 
will not be enough � I think that a round fifty sounds better! And, as for your future, don�t 
keep me waiting on your decision � let me know by morning.� 

 

So, Julie received her 50 strokes, in the course of which she achieved more than one orgasm. 

 

�Master, oh Master!� 

 

�Craack!� 

 

�Yes Julie.� 

 

�Craack!� 

 

�I want to stay with you always.� 

 

�You mean �I want to stay with you always, Master�. That will be another ten!� 

 



�Craack! 

 

�Oh, Master!� 

 

 

The End
