Missing by Rubberwolf 
Foreword 
Snow blanketed the surrounding landscape and a cold breeze blew in from the grey sea, causing a shudder through the assembled crowd. As if the pale moon were an inadequate illumination for the evening, the lighthouse, jutting out from the island on a narrow peninsular some five miles away, passed it&#8217;s strong beam over the people, who still needed the comfort of flash lights to banish the darkness from their midst. 

There were over two hundred people gathered around the village square, its ancient stone cottages and grey slate roofs a stark contrast to the focus of the evening&#8217;s activities. The casual observer would be forgiven for thinking that the islanders were engaged in a typical winter festival, and would look for a bonfire or fireworks. The air with charged with the crowds&#8217; anticipation, which was so strong that one could almost taste it, like the coppery tang of ozone in the atmosphere before a thunderstorm. 

Unlike the atmosphere that you might perceive at a rock concert just before the band arrives on stage, the crowd&#8217;s mood was more of a throwback to a previous age, when great fires were lit for Beltane and food would be left in the fire place as offerings to the fickle ghosts who would haunt the night.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, instead of worshipers facing the dawn, awaiting the first rays of sun to proclaim the end of winter, accompanied to the cry of �Solo Invictus,� the focus of the gathering was a young, petite woman who was being fussed over by several people.&nbsp; Obviously she was in the final stages of some bizarre ritual. 

She was not dressed particularly well to fend off the cold winter chill. While thick woollens, scarves and heavy winter coats were common place amongst the onlookers, the centre of their attention would have been more at home in a seedy motel, or fetish club. 

Her outfit consisted of a white rubber leotard, which was encased by a light pink, but very strict, under bust corset. Suspenders connected the corset to a pair of light pink, rubber stockings, which matched the arm length rubber opera gloves worn by the girl. Her feet were painfully encased in ten inch, light pink, rubber ballet boots with white laces, which forced her feet in to a torturous pirouette. Her thick dark hair was hidden beneath a pink rubber hood, which covered her head all the way down to the neck, only leaving her face uncovered. In her hand she held a metal rod, some two feet in length, topped with a bright crystal star. Although she did not hold the wand tightly, she found it impossible to let go, since it had been glued to the rubber glove by strong rubber adhesive. Her upper arms were also held in place by thick rubber straps attached to the corset, forcing her upper arms to hug her slender body. As a final detail, the rubber straps and corset fastenings were held securely in place by tiny padlocks. 

Once the padlocks were all secured, one of her attendants, a tall muscular man with a weathered face and callused hands, who one would normally expect to find aboard a fishing trawler, grabbed the girls jaw and forced it open, before roughly shoving a gag in to her mouth and securing the buckle tightly behind her head with a small padlock. The unresisting girl elicited a loud �Mppph� at the force of the intrusion. 

The gag was also made of pink rubber and now covered the lower half of her face and jaw. A pipe protruded from the mouth of the gag, with a round rubber ball dangling from the bottom of it. The fisherman took the ball and squeezed it. In total he squeezed the ball eight times, so that the inflatable rubber ball trapped securely in the girls mouth forced her jaws further and further apart until she felt that one more squeeze would be enough to unhinge her jaw bone. Once this had been inflated to the mans satisfaction, he disconnected the hose and pump from the gag. He then fished around in the hoods rim until he found a small wire, which he plugged in to a socket in the gag. 

While this was happening, another man brought a large, conical, thing made of transparent plastic, over to the girl. Two long rods were attached to the top of the hollow cone, giving it the appearance of a space rockets nose cone. The fisherman and another man stood either side of the girl while the third man brought the cone around to the front of her. As if reacting to some unheard signal, the two men grabbed one of the girl&#8217;s legs, at the knee and one of her arms and tilted the girl backwards, so that she was supported by both men horizontally. 

Once the girl was in place, the man with the cone approached the girl, lining the two shafts on the top of the cone, up with her pussy and anus, which could be seen through the crotch less leotard. The larger, twelve inch, shaft was set slightly off centre and was made of rubber, with the exception of the rounded steal tip, while the smaller, six inch shaft was comprised totally of rubber. Satisfied, he shoved the two phalluses in to her wet pussy and lubricated ass. This elicited another loud �Mppph� from the girl. Once she had stopped squirming, the third man then, with the help of the other two men, moved her legs in to position, so that the metal loops, secured to the inside of her legs by rubber straps aligned with corresponding holes in the cone. Once in position, he then reached inside the cone and secured stout padlocks to the inside, so that the girls&#8217; legs were now secured to the cone. 
Once her upper legs were secured, the man grabbed her ankles and aligned the loops which were built in to the boots, to the holes at the base of the cone. These were then padlocked in place. Once satisfied that the girl was now attached to the cone, the men lowered her so that she was forced to stand in this new undignified position, with the base of the cone a good twelve inches from the ground, due to the ballet boots and her legs forced apart by over three feet. 

One of the other attendants then brought a large sheet of white rubber over to the girl. Holding it out in front of him, as though he was about to shake the dust out of a blanket, the girl could see that it was roughly triangular in shape, with a distinct curve along the top and bottom edges. She could also make out long strips of piano wire that fanned out from the top rim, running the length of the material, to the lower rim. More wire around the lower rim ensured that the bottom half of the material formed a distinct wavy line. 

Approaching the girl, he wrapped the long skirt around her so that the upper half of the garment sat snugly around her tightly constricted, eighteen inch, waste. Reaching behind her he secured the two corners of the garment with poppers, before stepping back fussing over the skirt so that it hung loosely down the girls&#8217; legs, falling below the lower rim of the cone. Next he stepped around the girl and secured the poppers that ran down the back of the skirt which now looked like a rather large, cr�me puff style wedding dress. 

While he was securing the last popper, one of the other men approached with another skirt. This garment was of similar dimensions to the first, although it was comprised of baby pink rubber and did not have wire imbedded within it. This was placed over the top of the white under skirt, and fell a good five inches shorter than the first. Once this had been done up, the girl now looked as though she was wearing a large ball gown, with frilly, lacy white slip showing beneath. 

Next, a large pair of wings were brought over and attached to the corset. The corset had several buckles running down each side of the garment, which corresponded to straps on the giant, five foot white rubber and wire wings. Further straps were passed over the girls shoulders and secured to buckles near each arm pit of the corset. 
Once the three men had secured this contraption to the girl&#8217;s back, one of the men pulled a small electric wire from the wings and inserted it in to the rear of the skirt, to click home in to a socket within the cone. 

Finally, the last three items of the costume were produced. The girl watched helplessly through terrified eyes as a mask was pulled over her face and secured with laces at the back. The mask would not have looked out of place on a doll, since it had distinct female features and was painted with lip stick, rough and eye liner. A tube of paste was then emptied on to the top of the girls head and a long, curly, blond wig was pressed firmly on to the girls scalp. Finally a bright halo was suspended over the girls head and the long, stiff wire which supported it was rammed home, with a resounding click, in to a socket where the two wings joined. 

The girl watched, terrified, through the eye slits in the mask, as the men stepped back to allow the large, portable crane, which had been parked on the edge of the green, to be driven on to the field. Once it had stopped, with the arm above her, the hook was lowered, to be caught by one of the three men. Cables were then attached to reinforced steel loops in the corset and connected to the cranes hook.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once secured, the third man shouted instructions to the crane driver until the slack was taken up. Inspecting the cables, the man stood back and gave the OK signal to the crane driver, who unceremoniously forced his control lever forward at full power. 

A great cheer erupted from the crowd as the girl was raised in to the air and her panicked scream, muffled by the gag, was lost in the general uproar. Spot lights were then lit to follow the girls swaying progress until she came to a halt, sixty feet above the proceedings. She was then swung around until she was directly above the large fern tree which dominated the centre of the village green. She was not, however, alone in the heavens. Two men, standing on a raised platform, whose usual role was to repair street lights, caught the swinging girl and positioned her over the top of the tree. Once they had her securely in their grasp, one of the men spoke in to a hand held radio and instructed the crane driver to lower the crane. 

After a gradual drop of four foot, the girl came to rest on top of the tree, swaying slightly as she settled, the top of the tree firmly imbedded within the cone. The two men then lowered their platform slightly so that they could align the four steal bars secured to the tree, with the bottom of the cone. Once satisfied, they passed bolts through holes in the plastic, which corresponded with the ends of the steal bars. Each man then took a socket wrench and did up the bolts, securing the girl to the tree. Finally, an electric cable was retrieved from under the cone and plugged in to a socket at the top of the tree. 

Their work done, the men withdrew on their platform, leaving the girl to contemplate her new position and wishing that she was back on the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp; She terrified of heights and despite the pain of her previous position, she wished that the weight was back on her toes, rather than being forced to accommodate all of her weight on the dildo that was forcefully making its presence felt in her ass. 

Below, the crowd was becoming excited, as they accompanied the fisherman counting down from ten to zero. As the counting finished, with a great flourish on his podium, the fisherman pressed a large red button. Instantly, and amid much cheering, the lights on the Christmas tree and throughout the small village, sprung to life, bathing the small settlement in festive cheer as revellers made their way to the food tables and drinks that were arranged at the side of the village green.&nbsp; The large bonfire that had waited patiently for over three days was ignited and music blasted the quiet village from speakers erected around the green. 

On top of her perch, the girl opened her eyes. The tree was alive with flashing lights below her. Small LED lights, sewn in to her clothes began to flash in the same pattern as the other tree lights so that, from the girls&#8217; perspective, the flashing skirt appeared to extend fifty foot below her. In her hand, the wand glowed brightly and her halo bathed light down on to her face while lights danced along the wings in strobing patterns. 

Although the fairy still shifted uncomfortably on her perch, she now had a new focus of attention as the dildo in her pussy started to extend and retract in time with the lights and she screamed with ecstasy as an orgasm, that she had not even felt building, rocked her body and banished all coherent thought from her brain. 

Chapter 1 
Ann had worked for Chambers and Long for about two years now, she reflected. It was not a bad job, as far as these things went. The money was good. The hours however, were another mater, since she was often called to work late in to the early hours of the morning. Popular literature and television depicted the private detective as a down at heal graduate of the school of hard knocks, who would solve murder cases, or find stolen money after beating their way through various bad guys to find the truth. 

The reality was a little less glamorous. She did not wear a trench coat. She did not smoke, or drink. At least, she did not drink to the excess depicted in novels. In fact, Ann led a relatively healthy life. She went to the gym three times a week. She jogged every morning and evening and would often read trashy romance novels during stakeouts. Not your typical private dick, all things considered. 

The work itself was relatively mundane. Most of her cases usually preceded divorce hearings, since she was usually called upon to find out who was cheating whom. The majority of missing persons did not want to be found for honest reasons. They wanted to leave their husbands. They could not stand to be dominated by an interfering parent. Their mid life crisis had kicked in. Very rarely was Ann called in to find a person who had run off with lots of stolen money in a large sack, helpfully marked �Swag�. 

Although contacts on the street were still very important, much of the old-fashioned legwork had been replaced by computer searches. It was possible to find out a great deal about individuals, or organisations, simply by looking on the Internet. Of course, the ability to hack in to confidential files was, while illegal, an essential tool of the job. 
Business had been a little slow recently, but was on a seasonal upswing as the Christmas holidays approached. People became reckless as the season of good will approached. Although many people started thinking about their families, a great many cheats had been caught out at the office party, or by booking hotel rooms when they were supposed to be shopping for presents. It was with a certain economic optimism therefore, that Ann received her ten thirty client. 
Ann never failed to be amused by a new client&#8217;s first reaction to their introduction to Chambers and Long. Firstly, no trench coat. No down at heel, hard bitten, ex cop sitting behind the desk puffing away on his cigar. The initial reaction is to assume that the pretty, diminutive, brunette sitting behind the desk in a smart business suit, must be the infamous secretary. It comes as quite a shock to discover that Ann does not spend all day painting her nails and fending off creditors for her boss. It is even more of a shock to discover that Ann is in fact the person that they have come to see. 
As if Ann herself were not a shock, the office lacked the distinct grubbiness that one would expect. Her desk was not littered with paperwork. There were no ancient food wrappers strewn around the office. Projectiles that had missed their mark did not surround the waste paper bin. In fact, Ann&#8217;s office was quite well furnished and homely looking. This, of course, was Ann&#8217;s intention. Since many of her clients would be, by their very nature, distressed, or uncomfortable, Ann had ensured that when she met clients, they could relax as quickly as possible. 

This client however, while not exactly relaxed, was definitely in control. She did not seem at all phased, or surprised to see a woman behind the desk. In fact, Ann suspected that her client knew exactly whom she had come to see. 
After showing her client in to her office and offering her a seat, Ann leant back in her chair and studied her visitor. The initial impression was of a strong woman who was ageing well. Ann placed her age at around forty-five. Her dark, shoulder length hair, held back with hairpins could be considered severe. Her nails were immaculate, as were her clothes. Dark trouser suite and designer shoes, did not so much shout money, but hint at it very subtly. Her jewellery confirmed this. Plain, unobtrusive, but expensive. Her face, while striking, spoke of strength, as did her cold, piecing eyes. All in all, Ann reflected not a woman to cross. Taking this in to account, from the way that she was clasping her Gucci handbag firmly on her lap, her client was quite anxious about something. 
�So Mrs Birgett, how may I be of service to you?� 

After a moment&#8217;s hesitation, as if deciding weather she was doing the right thing, Mrs Birgett eventually spoke. 
�It&#8217;s my daughter. She has gone missing; Stacey is only twenty-three and had moved in to her own apartment six months ago. She seemed to be doing so well in her new job and then, about eight days ago she did not show up for work. I have been over to her apartment, but it&#8217;s as though she has just disappeared.� 
Looking down, Mrs Birgett started to rummage through her handbag. 

�Have you been to the police? They are more equipped to deal with this than I am. They have the resources and man power to spare,� Ann offered. 

�Oh yes, but they don&#8217;t seem that interested. I got the impression that they deal with a great many missing persons cases and I am not holding out much hope that they will find my daughter�, the woman stated as she fished out a collection of photographs and documents from her bag and placing them on the desk. 

Ann picked the items up and flicked through them. The photographs showed a very pretty young woman graduating from college in full gowns. Another showed the same woman on a beach, relaxing in a black bikini, propped up on one arm as she used the other to shade her eyes while smiling at the camera. The other documents were assorted phone bills, credit card receipts and bills. 

�I hadn&#8217;t heard from my daughter for a while, so I went over to her apartment. I thought that these bills might be useful in finding her,� Mrs Birgett stammered. 

Ann considered this for a few moments. 

�All right, I will see what I can do. In the mean time, could I have a copy of her apartment keys? It might help if I could go through her things and see if there might be anything that might give me an idea.� 

After that, it was just a matter of negotiating price. Mrs Birgett left slightly happier than when she entered and Ann was left to consider how to begin the investigation. The first course of action was to telephone an old friend in the police department, to see how much ground the police had covered. Three years with the force must have some benefits after all. She got through on the third ring, and arranged a meeting for the following morning. 

Getting up from her desk, she collected the papers and headed out of her office and down the corridor. Finding the door she wanted, she entered the room with only a gentle tap on the door before hand. 

As expected, Mick, the companies&#8217; computer expert, was busy behind his desk, or at least, the desk that was piled with old fast food boxes and other assembled junk that would probably require a bull dozer and a company of marines to wade through. 

�Hi Mick,� Ann cheerfully announced. 

The junk moved slightly and Mick peered up from his computer screen. It was hard to distinguish the man, from his surroundings. Long un-kept hair and food stained T-shirt insured that Mick blended perfectly with his surroundings. 
�Oh, hi Ann. Whats up?� 

Ann handed him the telephone bills and other documents. 

�You couldn&#8217;t get me some addresses to go with these numbers could you? 

Mike stared blearily at the documents, occasionally muttering to himself. But eventually he re-established eye contact. 

�Yeah, no problem. Come back in two days,� he stated before disappearing back in to his lair. 
This dismissal was typical of Mike and so Ann returned to her office, collected her coat and went to check out the missing girls&#8217; apartment. 










Among The Missing Part 2

Ann stared at the address that Mrs Birgett had given her as the car engine idled in the McDonalds parking lot. The empty wrappers proclaimed her lunch had consisted of a Big Mac and large fries. She slurped the last of the medium coke as she studied the town map, which she had spread out on the passenger seat. Having decided upon the best route to Nicky Birgetts apartment, she finished her drink, folded the map, so that the street she was heading for was still visible from her position, before selecting first gear and turning on to Fremont. 
After three miles, she eventually came to the turning that would lead her to Nicky&#8217;s apartment. Nicky lived in a desirable section of town. Only two miles from the centre of town, Nicky&#8217;s apartment was among a complex of buildings, designed in the mid eighties to meet the projected upswing in the economy expected by the markets. As the town began to attract commercial interest, it was decided that apartments represented a sounder investment in attempting to part the influx of young, single professionals, from their expendable income. 
As the economy boomed in the eighties, so did the demand for property and the developers made a nice profit, as the apartments sold quickly, at inflated prices. However, the market collapse towards the end of the decade had a dramatic effect on property ownership so that most of the flats were now owned by land lords, rather than the envisioned wealthy young professionals. 
As a result, most of the tenants were now low to middle income. Although the properties were still desirable, the red brick structures now took on the air of a council estate, rather than professional apartments. This was emphasized by the layout of the award winning buildings, which were arranged in a rectangular formation around a central lawn. The designers envisioned that this courtyard would reduce crime, since all of the houses looked in on each other. The end result was that the buildings gave off the air of a Victorian prison complex, complete with exercise yard. 
The flats were built on three levels. The first and second floors having balconies, while the ground floor had access to a small garden, which competed for space among the garbage lockers and a communal washing line. 
Ann parked her car in the space for Nicky&#8217;s apartment and walked in to the courtyard, fighting her way over dissuaded children&#8217;s bicycles and toys, before finding the sign, which pointed to Nicky&#8217;s flat. After some searching she found herself walking up a flight of stairs to the top floor. At the top of the stairs, Ann stepped on to a shared landing that gave access to two flats. Nicky&#8217;s door was surrounded by the sort of welcoming decorations that showed a busy woman lived here. Two pot plants on either side of the door were in dire need of sunlight, although they had been watered recently. The plants displayed their obvious distress by shedding dry, brown leaves all over the dusty brown welcome mat. Confirmation that Ann had found the right place was provided by the doorbell, which had a helpful, if faded, label with Nicky&#8217;s name on it. Ann therefore dug in to her handbag and retrieved the apartment key that she had been given and opened the door. 
Unlike the first impression from outside, the inside was spacious, light and well appointed. The cream walls and pale carpet appeared would, Ann mused, have been the landlords choice, while the black leather three piece suite proclaimed that this was definitely the property of a young, single person. The glass coffee table and wide screen television all pointed to the fact that the furniture had been purchased within the last two years and that, judging by the lack of junk and ornamentation, which usually grows over a lifetimes worth of collecting, the occupant had not lived away from the family home for a great period of time. However, the stark functionality had been broken up by various pot plants scattered around the flat which, unlike their unfortunate contemporaries on the door step, were obviously receiving more attention from their owner. On closer examination, Ann discovered that these too had been watered recently. 
The kitchen was well laid out and well supplied. The refrigerator did not contain milk, or dairy products. Either Nicky Birgett had an allergy problem, was on a diet of some kind, or she had anticipated being away for some time and removed the items that would sour quickly from her fridge. However, these were not the most interesting things to be found in the refrigerator. Upon opening the freezer section, Ann&#8217;s eyes were automatically drawn to the ice tray. String protruded from the ice cubes. Each piece of string had a small label tied to one end. Inside each ice cube, Ann could see that there was something solid imbedded within the ice. Closer examination showed that there were keys within the ice. The string was tied to the ends of the keys. Puzzled, Ann read some of the labels. One had the word �H Cuffs�, another �Chast Belt�, yet another �Spreader�. Replacing the ice tray, Ann went to explore the rest of the apartment. 
The main bedroom was as one would expect. No bedside photographs indicated that Nicky did not have anyone special in her life. The wardrobe contained the usual business clothes and shoes. Jogging pants sweat shirts and used trainers proclaimed that Nicky liked to keep in trim. However, gaps in the wardrobe, clearly apparent to a female eye, indicated that the girl had taken clothes with her. Returning to the living room, she walked across to the second bedroom. This was intriguing, since it was the only internal door with a lock on it. Apart from the computer station that dominated one corner of the living room, Ann felt that whoever Nicky Birgett really was would be answered behind this door. She collected the keys from where she had left them and the coffee table. Although she tried them all, none would fit the lock. Bending down she examined the lock. A simple, one chamber affair. Not really a problem. Ann retrieved her hand bag, from where she had left it when she came in, rummaged through its cavernous interior and returned to the locked door, lock picks in hand. After a few seconds, the lock made a satisfying click and Ann opened the door. 
Ann was not sure what she was expecting to find, but this was definitely not it. The interior looked as though it had been designed by the Spanish inquisition. Nicky liked to keep in shape and, Ann mused, had opted for the DeSade work out program. A flat, wooden table dominated the room. In one corner, a modified work out bench and in another a strange, padded saw horse. Against one wall a strange wheel was bolted. Ann remembered seeing something similar at a circus. All of the furniture, no matter how strange, had one thing in common. Shackles. Ann did not need a PhD to deduce what happened in this room. 
The centre of the room was dominated by a winch, below which, three sets of study iron rings were bolted to the floor in a row. Ann was shocked to discover that her mouth had become very dry and that her panties had become quite damp. Her heart missed a beat as she noticed the final occupant of the room. Behind the door that she had entered stood two large wardrobes. Ann approached them with a sense of building excitement as she reached for the handle of the first wardrobe. 
As she opened the door, her senses were overwhelmed by the smell of rubber and Ann stood motionless for several seconds, gazing an awe at the contents of the wardrobe, before reaching a tentative hand out to stroke one of the garments. Ann stepped forward and began rummaging through the wardrobe like an excited child on her birthday. There were cat suits, dresses, short skirts, long skirts, shoes and boots with lethal looking spikes for heals, face masks, gloves, stockings. Her mind swam with all of the possibilities that the wardrobe presented. Taking a deep breath she stepped back, closed the door and tried to control her pulse as she stared at the second wardrobe. Ann had not realised that she could be so turned on by this stuff. However, after only a moment&#8217;s hesitation, she reached for the handle on the second wardrobe. 
As she had suspected, this wardrobe contained hand cuffs, leg irons, gags and such a variety of restraints that she had trouble comprehending their variety, or use. Never the less, she reached a tentative hand and stroked a set of leather cuffs that hung from a peg on the open door. Taking them firmly in her hand, she picked up the cuffs and sniffed them, before attaching one cuff to her wrist, struggling with one hand to do up the buckle. Deep in thought, Ann noticed a box containing keys similar to the ones that she had found in the kitchen. Now she understood the labels and why the keys had been trapped in ice. How long would it take for the ice to melt? Would she like to find out? It came as a shock to her that she would, as she pictured herself wearing the most outrageous outfit, bound to one of the apparatus in the room, unable to escape for several hours until the ice had melted. 
Ann returned to the first wardrobe and started to rummage through the clothes in earnest. After a short while she had amassed quite a collection of clothes on the floor. She then stood back, kicked off her sensible shoes, with two inch-squared heels and began to undress. The first thing she picked up was a pair of bright red tights. She sat down on one of the benches and tried to pull them on, but the rubber, despite her smooth, recently waxed, legs, caused too much friction for her to pull the garment on easily. Returning to the wardrobe, she was beginning to get frustrated, when she noticed a small bottle of talcum powder in one of the wooden slots, next to the most gaudy make up she had seen since she had last inadvertently flicked on to the cable porn channel. Reaching down, she snatched up the powder and returned to the bench. Having sprinkled the inside of the garment sufficiently, the tights glided up her legs, gripping them tightly in their wonderfully constrictive embrace. However, while pulling them up her thighs, she noticed something in the gusset that did not seem right. Pealing the tights back, she examined the problem. Two of the largest dildos that she had ever seen and made from some strange, jelly like plastic, were firmly attached to the inside of the tights. 
�Oh well, in for a penny, in for a pound,� she reasoned. 
Although her pussy was now so juicy she could have solved the third world drought problems all by herself, her ass was another matter. She remembered seeing a tube of KY next to the talcum powder and so hobbled back to the wardrobe. After two generous dollops, she eased the dildos inside of her and pulled the tights up over her hips. Examining herself in one of the many, full-length mirrors that adorned the room, Ann could not suppress an excited quiver as her body informed her of its approval at the new look. And she was back before the pile of clothes before she realised that she had left the mirror. 
The next item that she selected was a strange rubber corset with a confusing number of buckles attached to it. After examining it for several moments, she undid he appropriate buckles and guided herself in to the corset. The black, shiny rubber felt cool on her skin. But soon, like the tights, they warmed up nicely as she fiddled with the straps. 
Having re-fastened the three straps that ran down her left side, she leant between her legs and pulled the strap that hung between her legs, pulling it towards her and attaching it to the buckle that hung down from the front of the garment, pulling tightly and forcing the dildos further in to her ass and pussy. Once she was securely wearing the corset, she then set about undoing the straps and pulling as tightly as possible before re-fastening the buckles. 
Moving back to the mirror, Ann was thrilled by the result. Although the corset was full length, running, in effect, from her crotch to her neck, her boobs were exposed and the cut of the garment forced her 34D breasts in to new, undreamed of proportions. The black and red also looked very good together. 
Returning to the pile, she decided to try the shoes next. She stepped in to the six inch, red court shoes and bent down to tie the single strap that wound around her ankle. Once secure, she stood up and tried to find her balance. This was not easy for a girl used to sensible shoes. She had, in her teenage years, taken to wearing four-inch heels. But they had been square and were no preparation for the way these shoes forced her weight sharply forward, or for the way that the stiletto could trip her up at a moment&#8217;s inattention. However, she was soon confidently striding around the room, admiring her silhouette as she passed by the mirrors. Ann soon discovered that swaggering around in high heels, with dildos stuck up her pussy, had distinct, but not unpleasant side effects, as she felt an orgasm building within her, caused by the movement forced on her intruders. She had only just realised what was happening when her legs began to buckle and she had to throw herself against the wall, grabbing on to a conveniently placed manacle in order to remain upright, as her body shuddered through the rigors of orgasm. 
�Oh well, that was fun,� thought Ann as she ambled back to the pile of clothes intent on undressing now that she had shot her bolt. That was the plan anyway. She had nearly reached the wardrobe when she felt her pussy insist that she had not finished yet. She was amazed to discover that she was still horny and instead of getting undressed, she reached for the next item in the pile. 
Ann applied plenty of talcum powder so that the bright red opera gloves slid easily up her arms. They looked, she decided, quite spectacular. Reaching down, she picked up the strange looking harness that, because of the large phallus and the shape of the straps, she had decided must be an elaborate gag of some kind. She considered the object for several seconds before replacing it on the floor pile and walking to the make up that she had seen earlier in the wardrobe. Collecting the make up box, she hobbled over to one of the benches next to a mirror. 
She quickly removed her old make up, using the appropriate bottle and a wad of cotton wool. She then considered herself in the mirror for several moments before reaching for the first item of make up. Fifteen minutes later her transformation was complete and the woman who stared back at her proclaimed �For Hire�, but at a very high cost, in large glossy lettering. The bright red lipstick that she now wore had been given a layer of gloss. The rouge, as intended, had been applied generously to emphasise her cheekbones. Light blue eye shadow and a pair of artificial lashes helped to complete the ensemble. The combination of the make up, the rubber clothes and her thick, dark, shoulder length curls transformed Ann in to a sexual predator. Satisfied, she tentatively stepped back to the wardrobe, careful not to orgasm until she was ready. 
Picking up the head harness that she had discarded earlier, she inserted the rubber penis in to her mouth and did up the buckles, which ran over her head, and under her jaw. Once she had finished she found it impossible to open, or close her jaw. If the tightness of the rubber had not made her feel very enclosed, the tight straps that ran around the back of her head, under her jaw and in a V shape on either side of her nose, joining at the bridge in to a single strap that went over the top of her head certainly emphasised the feeling. 
The last item in the now diminished pile was a bright red posture collar. Picking up the strange devise, she walked over to a mirror so that she could see what she was doing while fitting the device. After several minutes of fumbling, the collar was, at last, in place and laced up, forcing her head back in an uncomfortable arc. 
Ann then walked over to the box of keys and then took the box over to the contraption that she was to be imprisoned in. Checking the fit of the keys until she had found the right keys for the right locks, she took the keys with her and returned to the refrigerator and its ice tray. After matching the keys from the box, with their frozen counterparts, she then pulled the desired keys out of the tray and returned to the wardrobe, replacing the unfrozen keys. 
With everything prepared she walked with nervous anticipation towards the strange, saw horse that she had seen earlier. She tied the frozen keys, by their strings, to the appropriate lengths of chain that adorned the contraption. She was now ready and stood with her legs apart, so that they were close to the legs of the bench. She positioned her legs so that they were resting in the open manacles that were attached to the bench legs. She then bent over and fastened the steel manacles around her ankles, locking them in place with the padlocks, which were next to the legs. Once in place, she leant over the padded bar in the centre, and pulled the thick rubber strap, attached to the bar, over the small of her back, getting as much leverage as possible in to each pull, so that when she eventually closed the buckle, she was held quite firmly. 
Finally, she leant all of the way over, so that she now had an upside down view of the world. Using both hands, she reached down and grabbed the hand cuff style restraint that was chained to the forward leg of the bench. She then placed her left hand in to the cuff and used her right hand to lock it around her wrist. She then ensured that she could reach the key string with her left hand. Satisfied, she picked up the key with her right and used the steel point, on the end of the key, to lock the mechanism, ensuring that they would not tighten, before dropping the key. 
The right hand cuff would be the hardest part of all, since she would have to lock it with the hand that was being secured. She had therefore tied the key string to the leg, using a release knot that would come undone easily with one tug. This held the open cuff against the leg, allowing her to catch the cuff and manoeuvre it around her wrist. It was then a simple matter of turning the cuff so as to use the bench leg as an anchor point from which to lever the device shut. She then pulled the key string and with some dexterity, inserted the point of the key in to position and locked the mechanism, before releasing the key. 
Finally secured, Ann tested her bonds. All of her pulling and shifting about did not, to Ann&#8217;s satisfaction, free her, or even loosen her bonds. She was, for some reason that escaped her, enjoying herself, as she imagined herself held prisoner by a wicked crime lord, like some heroine in a trashy detective novel. She even made the appropriate noises in to her unusual gag, which, unless she sucked on it vigorously, caused drool to run out of her mouth and up her face. 
After ten or so minutes, she decided that it was time to work on the dildo and so wriggled her ass around within the restraints. This did not have the same effect that she had experienced earlier. The strap across her back restricted her attempts at arousal, so that she was only able to get excited, but not, it seemed, bring her to climax. Ann, however, was not a girl to give in easily. She therefore increased her struggles in a desperate attempt to cum. After half an hour of unrewarded struggling, she looked forlornly at the key, which was still firmly embedded in ice. It would take hours, Ann reasoned, for the ice to melt sufficiently to allow her to release her. The worst of it was that she was now incredibly horny. Her efforts had succeeded in getting her aroused to the point of orgasm, but no more. In temper she screamed in to the gag and thrashed about uselessly on the bench until she was hot, sweaty and out of breath. 
Ann lay panting on the sawhorse, desperately trying to think of a way to free herself, or bring herself off. The sound of a key being inserted in to the front door brought her to her senses with the speed of a sudden slap across the face. Again she thrashed fruitlessly against the bonds as she heard a male voice call in to the apartment. 
�Nicky. Are you in? Nicky.� 
This was not the owner of the flat returning unexpectedly, but one of her friends. Ann was stunned. All of the excuses and explanations that had rushed through her panicked brain, now fled at the sound of approaching footsteps. Ann slumped in to her bonds, resigned to her fate. 
�Nicky, Ni�. Well what have we here?� the man asked as the sound of footsteps changed to the distinctive thud produced by the dungeons laminate flooring. 
Ann watched with horror as a pair of shoes walked in to her line of site. 
�No. Not Nicky. Who are you?� 
Ann attempted the only communication that she could manage, drawing attention to the fact that she was gagged. 
�Mppph. Mppph.� 
�Well, if you can not speak for yourself, let&#8217;s weigh up the evidence. You are not Nicky and therefore not the owner of this flat. You have riffled through Nicky&#8217;s personal things and are now wearing her clothes. At best that makes you an intruder and at worse a thief. The question is, what am I to do with you?� 
Ann struggled in to her bonds and mopped for all she was worth as the man circled her. 
�The police might be interesting, but maybe you would prefer that we kept them out of it. What do you say?� 
Ann could just imagine what would happen if the police arrived. She would never live this down and so, after several moments, she slumped in to her bonds. 
The stranger considered her for several second before reaching some sort of decision. 
�OK then. No police. But you must be punished for what you have done. Don&#8217;t you agree? Stay there, I will be back in a moment.� 
Saying that, the stranger walked away. She heard the front door open and close. She was now alone in the flat again. She reached for the keys. They still had a long while yet, but if she could warm them in her hands, she might be able to melt the ice before the man returned. However, ten minutes later she heard the front door open and the mans&#8217; footsteps stride in to the room. They went over to the wardrobe and, after what seemed an eternity, walked in to her line of vision. 
The man, if it was the same man, had changed. He now a pair of shiny, black, rubber trousers and a pair of rubber boots, with shiny steel around the toe and along the sides, that she thought she recognised from the film Judge Dredd. 
�You look a little uncomfortable like that. Why don&#8217;t I do something about those bonds?� 
The man walked around to Ann&#8217;s head, bent down and, using one of the keys from the wardrobe, undid her left wrist. Before she could resist, the man jerked her wrist behind her and attached another cuff to her wrist. Holding her wrist against her back, he then repeated the procedure with her other wrist, until her arms were cuffed securely behind her, while positioning his body close to hers, ensuring that she did not straighten up. As well as handcuffs, the man had taken a pad lock from the wardrobe. Opening the lock, he threaded the bar through the hand chains on the hand cuff and then pulled her arms up until he could attach the pad lock to a D ring on the posture collar. Once this was clicked in place, he left his prisoner to return to the wardrobe. 
Ann unbent, as much as she could with the strap pulled tightly across her back. She felt that she had been bent over for hours and heard satisfying clicking noises as her spine was allowed some freedom after so long. 
�Who said you could move thief?� demanded the man as he marched imperiously towards her. 
Ann only had a short glimpse of the man advancing towards her. But it was to form an initial impression. He was a little older than she was, perhaps twenty-eight, but no more than thirty. He was well built, with dark hair and hazel eyes. He was also clad, neck to toe, in glossy black rubber. 
�We shall have to do something about your wilfulness,� the man scolded as he bent her over again. 
His rubber clad hand flashed in to her line of sight as, bending down, he grabbed one of her exposed breasts. His other hand, which was holding something long, like chord, came in to view. Her nipples were shamefully erect and needed little encouragement as the man toyed with her. Just as she was getting aroused again she screamed in to the gag as the man painfully clamped something on to her nipple. She tried to arch back, but the mans hand shot out and clamped on to the top of her head. 
She watch, mesmerised, as the man pulled on the chord, which stretched as he did so and fed it through an eye hole mounted on the floor above her head. He then pulled the chord through, grabbed her breast and clamped the chord on to her other erect nipple, eliciting another loud noise in to the gag. 
�There, isn&#8217;t that more comfortable thief?� demanded the man as he stepped back to admire his handiwork. �Although your posture could do with a little more adjustment,� the man stated as he headed back to the wardrobe. 
Ann watched him go, but her eyes were drawn down ward to her breasts and the bright red bungee chord which pulled her nipples painfully towards her. Sensing movement, she looked through her legs towards the man who approached her carrying something that looked like the strange spanner that you find in your boot for changing tyres. 
The man stood at her side and bent down, inserting the spanner in to the hexagonal nut, just under the padded bar. He then began to tighten the nut. 
Ann was not sure what was happening, but she knew that the bar was getting higher, pulling on her chords and stretching her legs until they were so tight that her feet left the security of the ground. While she was contemplating this, the man appeared in the view again, this time brandishing a large riding crop. 
�Time to take your punishment thief,� the man announced as the riding crop arched towards her ass. 
Thwack, thwack, thwack. 
The three blows were delivered in quick succession to her exposed bottom, causing her to jerk in her bonds and scream in to her gag. 
Thwack, thwack, thwack. 
More blows rained down on her unprotected ass so that it burned and throbbed. Ann began to sob with the pain and humiliation that she was suffering and also with the shame that she was seriously turned on. The motion of her ass, inspired by her beating had caused an unexpected reaction from the dildos. As a consequence, Ann found that she was very wet and very, very horny. 
Ann was not sure when the beating finished, all that she knew was that she was sobbing, horny and that the man was now standing by her head and pulling her head back. He reached for the gag and demonstrated that he could have asked for an explanation at any time, without removing the harness, as he unclipped the penis from the harness and removed it from her mouth. Although this offered some freedom, she still could not close her mouth, due to a steel ring, attached to the head harness that was trapped in her mouth. 
�Well, what have you got to say for yourself thief?� the man demanded. 
Ann was not sure where the words came from, or who was saying them, only that she wanted them to be true. She was not sure what this said about her, or her morals, but they were spoken before she could think of anything else. 
�Uck ee. Uck ee ow. Ease?� Ann begged of her captor, who merely chuckled and undid the strange studded rubber codpiece that he was wearing, letting it fall open and expose his pride and joy. 
Ann stared in wonder at the ten-inch cock, which was covered in thick black rubber, apart from the bulb, which was bare. 
�Then I suggest you open wide,� the man chuckled as he grabbed her hair and pulled her head painfully up, level with his cock. 
Ann greedily engulfed his man hood, as best as she could, as he rammed it to the back of her throat and started to pump her face. The man, as if to underscore her position, punctuated each thrust with a stinging blow from the riding crop. This caused the most delicious ripples to spread through the dildo, sending her already sensitive pussy to the point of orgasm. 
Finally, she felt the tell tale quiver from the mans&#8217; penis. This was quickly followed by an impressive eruption of cum, which filled Ann&#8217;s mouth and senses with the sticky, salty taste of cum. As if responding to some subliminal signal, Ann&#8217;s orgasm was triggered almost at the same moment, causing her to buck in her bonds as her body was wracked by the strongest orgasm she had ever know. 
All sense of reality fled as Ann, gripped by violent convulsions, screamed in to the mans cock, jerking upright, causing thick, sticky, cum to splash her face and hair and causing the nipple clamps to be pulled off of her agonised nipples with a resounding twang. 
Ann lay slumped, panting and twitching, across the cross bar, as the man undid her restraints. 
�Hi, I&#8217;m Dave,� said the man. �How do you know Nicky? I don&#8217;t recognise you from the club.� 
It was time to come clean. Ann waited until she had been released before hobbling in to the living room. 
�I don&#8217;t actually know her,� Ann confessed. �I am a private investigator. Her mother hired me to find her. Apparently she has been missing for some weeks.� 
�Do you have any ID. I mean, you didn&#8217;t appear to be investigating much when I found you.� 
Ann hid her blush as she bent down and took her licence from her bag. Although she still did not make eye contact as she handed him the document. 
�To be honest, I don&#8217;t know what I was doing. I just found all of this stuff and it&#8217;s like�. Like.� Ann struggled to find the words to convey what she had been doing when Dave found her. �Like I don&#8217;t know. I just had to try on the clothes and� 
Ann was interrupted at the eruption of laughter coming from Dave. She was not surprised by his reaction, she was used to it. But she had never had a reaction as strong as this. Usually it is a look, or a suppressed grin. But never open, gut wrenching laughter. 
�Ann Summers. This has to be a fake. Then again, it does have a certain symmetry. Ann Summers. Private eye to the kinky and perverse. Oh God that&#8217;s rich,� he chortled as he handed back her card (Note to Americans, Australians and other rare and exotic creatures: Ann Summers is the brand name for a popular chain of high street stores that sell kinky underwear and sex toys). 
Ann staggered over to the bathroom. 
�So what are you doing here. Are you Nicky&#8217;s boyfriend?� 
�No I am her neighbour. We did go out for a while. But since we are both Doms, it didn&#8217;t really work out. No I just agreed to water her plants while she was away, although she has been gone longer than I expected. You don&#8217;t think anything has happened to her do you?� 
Ann emerged from the bathroom, having wiped the cum from her face, went in to the kitchen and put the kettle on for coffee. God did she need a coffee. 
�I don&#8217;t know, that is what I intend to find out.� 
Five minutes later, Ann was sitting on Dave&#8217;s lap like a love struck teenager, discussing her options and questioning Dave on what Nicky had said the last time that they had talked. 
�There is not much to tell. Apparently her father had just died and she needed a few days to herself. She was a little distraught. But I don&#8217;t think that Nicky would do anything, you know, stupid. I hope not anyway. How will you find her?� 
�Well,� Ann considered for a moment. �I will need to have a look at her computer. That&#8217;s usually a good place to start. You also mentioned a club. It sounded like this is a place that she attends quite often, so that might be a good place to ask questions.� 
Dave considered for several moments before answering. 
�It&#8217;s a fetish club. You will need a member to escort you in. There is also a dress code. But you already have that sorted. When were you thinking of going?� 
�Tonight,� Ann answered without hesitation. �Although I think I had better buy my own clothes, rather than Nicky&#8217;s. If her friends recognise that I am wearing her clothes it might cause complications. Where do I go to buy this stuff anyway?� 
A grin spread over Dave&#8217;s face. 
�You might want to change your clothes before we go. Although I don&#8217;t mind if you don&#8217;t.� Dave&#8217;s grin got wider as he eyed her with open lust. �When you&#8217;re ready I am going to take you on the most exciting shopping trip of your life.�

Missing Chapter 3 by Rubberwolf 
Ann sipped her coffee, while sitting on Dave&#8217;s lap and accepting a cuddle while they chatted. Dave, it appeared was a self employed programmer. This meant that he worked from home; only venturing out to meet clients, discuss requirements and to trouble shoots their systems. He had known Nicky since she moved in. Although they had had a brief affair, it soon became apparent that two doms did not mix. They had remained friends and still went out together. But that was all. 
Ann explained to him about her life and how she would go about finding Nicky. Once they had finished their coffees, they both got changed back in to more conventional clothing. Before leaving with Dave, Ann finished her search, finding nothing else of interest until she had gotten to the computer. Although she could not access the internet, due to password protection, Nicky had not been keeping up with her housekeeping and the �Cookies� file contained hundreds of listings. Ann smiled at the thought of all of the junk mail that must have built up in the e-mail since Nicky had left. However, Ann was not sorry for Nicky&#8217;s sloppiness and quickly transferred a copy of the folder on to disc. She would drop it in to the office for them to look at later. Having found all that she could set off, arm in arm with Dave, for what he described as the shopping experience of a lifetime. 
Ann thought that she knew how to shop. After all, it was the other major female prerogative. However, after a couple of hours with Dave, she was forced to reconsider. She also decided that it was time for a coffee. Dave had walked the legs off of her, taking her to small out of the way boutiques and alternative fashion shops. They found a small coffee house in which to recuperate, with old world charm, clean tables and the look of a small family business that had been heard since the Middle Ages. Quiet, cozy, and just the place for examining the days purchases. 
Ann rummaged through her bags, seeing what two hours of hard shopping had yielded. She was now the proud owner of three pairs of court shoes, with six inch heels. One pair in red, one in white and one in black. Another bag held a rather nice, Victorian style lace corset in purple, with black lace trim. She also had a leather bustier and matching thong, as well as a variety of stockings to go with a rather nice leather suspender belt and bra. She had also amassed an assortment of rather harsh jewelry and accessories. 
Dave returned with a tray of coffee and cakes and they spent a pleasant half an hour discussing life, the universe and shopping. Having consumed their cakes and drank their coffee, Dave proposed that they drop the shopping off at the car, before returning to the town centre. Ann had thought that the shopping trip was over. As if reading this from her face, Dave stated that he had saved the best for last and that she should come bearing plastic, since she would need it. Half an hour later, having deposited her shopping, Ann followed Dave as he meandered his way through the back streets in the old part of town. 
Eventually, they arrived at the shop, which was situated next to the harbor, in the barbican district, so named because of the old fortifications that dominated the entrance to the harbor and rose up behind the shops, like an ancient wonder of the world, testimony to a troubled history that was now, only remembered in films. It was quite an old building, made of stone, with a grey slate roof and a metal grid covering the darkened window. Peering in to the window, Ann noticed that the dummies were wearing a variety of rubber and leather clothes. Some wore masks of leather; some brandished whips, or were restrained in some manner. This, Ann decided, was definitely their destination. 
Unlike the outside, the interior was brightly lit, with the most amazing clothes ranged around her in an explosion of bright colors. Next to the door, the owner had arranged a display of shoes and boots. Bright patent reds and high glossy blacks vied for attention like fetish flowers competing for sunlight on a forest floor. Taking her eyes away from the shoes, she was stunned by a variety of rubber garments which took up the entire length of one wall, on two levels, while other clothes hung from racks in the centre of the shop. The till area was bracketed on all sides by various things in boxes, most of which required batteries, while the wall next to the changing area sported whips, manacles, cuffs, gags, masks and all manner of interesting items. 
The shop assistant, a young woman, sat quietly at her station, doing her best to be discreet, while giving the air of approachability, as Ann turned in slow circles, mouth open, taking in the variety of goods that would fill her dreams from now on. As if a stage hypnotist had snapped his fingers, Ann suddenly sprang in to action, descending on the racks of clothes like a lioness pouncing on an unsuspecting impala. 
Two hours later Ann staggered back to her car, with Dave&#8217;s help, as she struggled beneath a small mountain of bags and boxes. In fact, it took two runs in order for all of Ann&#8217;s purchases to be secreted in to her small car. 
Although Dave had helped her to choose various garments, offering advice and opinions as Ann emerged from the changing room, only to disappear with another item of clothing clutched to her chest, it was the young shop assistant who had been the most help, offering opinions and advice as she passed various items in to the changing rooms, chatting merrily to her customer as though they were two close friend choosing outfits for a girls night out. 
Ann arrived home an hour later, having dropped Dave off, having arranged to meet at seven O&#8217;clock, so that he could sign her in at the club. Although it was only two O&#8217;clock, Ann did not consider this a great deal of time to get ready. Even so, she put the kettle on, made herself a coffee, re-heated a ready meal in the microwave and sat amid the carnage of carrier bags and boxes so that she could inspect the day&#8217;s purchases. Although her credit card had suffered, business had been good and, she could easily afford the balance transfer that she would have to make before the end of the month. 
Feeling slightly less tired, having finished her weight watchers pizza and chips and high octane coffee (Uganda Robusta &#8211; dark roast), she e-mailed the cookies file to the office and then set about inspecting her haul. She took all of the bags and boxes in to the bedroom, emptying their contents, while making room in her wardrobe to accommodate her new look. She now owned several corsets, shoes, knickers, hoods, masks, gags, whips, shackles, hand cuffs, boots, skirts and dresses. This was not going to be easy. However, after some shuffling and clearing out, her wardrobe bulged at the seams with new garments and toys. She had left several items on the bed, to try out now, as well as an outfit for the evening. 
Having sorted out all of the keys from the various locks and cuffs, she separated them so that one set of each was placed in her dressing table draw; while the spare set she took with her in to the kitchen. She opened the refrigerator and, emptying the ice trays, placed the keys in to the appropriate containers, before filling them with water and placing them in the ice box. After this, she went to her bedroom, undressed and took a shower. 
After the fastest shower that she had ever taken in her life, she approached the items that she had left on the bed with a barely suppressed shudder of excitement. The first item that she chose was a pair of white knickers. These were quite large, encasing her entire bottom. Once she had slid them up her legs, just before pulling them over her bottom, she reached in to her pile of clothes and found a rather large vibrator. She did not need to lubricate this as she was already quite wet and the implement slid in to place with ease. The large butt plug in the knickers however, did need lubrication and she applied a generous dollop of KY jell to the shaft, before sprinkling the inside of her garment with talcum powder. She then pulled the knickers up. The glided over her skin in a smooth, motion, aided by the talcum powder. Some adjustment was called for in order to insert the butt plug, but again this glided in to her orifice as though it were a part of her. 
Next, she slid in to a pair of lavender stockings. These were accompanied by a pair of white, ankle length, ballet boots, which forced her feet in to a graceful, but precarious, ten inch balancing act. This was followed by a rubber cincher, also in lavender, with white piping and suspenders, which she attached to her stocking tops. 
The cincher was, to all in tense and purposes, a mini corset, being heavily boned and fastened by laces, it was easier to slip in to than the corset she had worn earlier. The main reason for this was that the laces were tied from the front, so that Ann was able to pull the laces very tight without the aid of a door jam, bedpost, or other implement. 
This done, she hobbled painfully over to the mirror to admire her reflection. Despite the intense pain in her toes, caused by the constrictive boots which, truth to be told, were never designed for any other purpose, Ann had to admit that she looked good. The boots and corset did wonders for her posture. The hour glass figure that she had achieved emphasized her bust, making them stand proud away from her body, giving the illusion of opulence that, until recently, Ann had not associated with herself. After a few minutes admiring her reflection Ann returned to the pile of clothes. 
The next item that she chose was a lavender hood, similar to a diver&#8217;s helmet. Bunching her thick curls behind her head, she pulled the garment over her head. With a little tweaking and pulling she had soon achieved the desired effect of a smooth rubber skull, without any wrinkles. 
The next item to come out of the pile was a pair of white opera gloves. After applying talcum powder to her arms and the inside of the gloves, she found that they glided on smoothly. After she had done this turned her attention to the dress. It was a simple, front fastening, sheaf dress which, after applying more talcum powder, she placed on the floor and stepped in to, before pulling the garment up. 
Getting in to the dress proved quite difficult and Ann wondered if she had not been a little optimistic on the sizing. But after a little coaxing she was able to zip the front of the dress up. Although getting the zipper past the bust proved a little tricky. However, once she had pulled the zipper all of the way up the high necked collar, she pulled a strap over her throat, effectively sealing the zipper under a thick rubber strap and buckle. 
�Nearly done,� Ann congratulated herself, as she staggered over to her dressing table and opened the bag containing her new make up. After applying a heavy foundation she applied a generous amount of red rouge to her cheeks, following the line of the bone so that, not only were they made to look rosy and healthy, but also emphasized the natural curve of her face, heightening the bone structure. 
Bright pink lip stick was brushed on next, before outlining her lips with a darker pencil. This was followed by a coat of clear gloss finish. Satisfied, she turned to her eyes, rubbing the lids with bright pink eye shadow. A pair of extravagantly long, false, eye lashes was next, which she blended in with a black lash brush. Finally she applied eye liner. Pleased with how Barbie doll she looked, Ann grinned as she returned for the last few items of her outfit. 
Picking up a large ball gag, she spread her mouth as wide as it would go before forcing the large rubber ball between her teeth and doing up the buckle. Finally she placed a fierce looking, white, posture collar around her neck before doing up the front lacing. 
Satisfied with the result in the mirror, she went to the wardrobe and retrieved the camera that she used for surveillance. Setting it on the tripod she took a few posed pictures of herself before angling the camera on to the bed. 
Now it was time for her favorite purchase. Opening another box, she pulled out a set of four, bulky metal shackles, attached to chains. She clamped these to the four corners of the bed. Electric cable ran down the chain from each shackle. Ann plugged these in to a four way extension socket which, in turn, was plugged in to a timing socket mounted in the wall. Normally this would be used to turn the lights on in the morning, but it had a different purpose now. 
Having set the timer for the socket and the camera, Ann lay down on the bed. She then connected a shackle to each ankle and one wrist. The electromagnets inside the cuffs locked in to place. The shackles would not open again until the power was turned off in an hours time. Finally, Ann reached down and turned on the vibrator, before locking her final wrist in place. She was now a spread eagled rubber doll held prisoner on her own bed with a vibrator in her pussy, a butt plug up her ass and a large gag in her mouth. She could not have been happier. It was not long before her first orgasm hit. 
Over the next hour Ann jerked wildly on the bed in the throws of, as she felt at the time, continuous orgasm. All too soon the locks clicked open and reluctantly Ann turned off the vibrator and got out of bed. It was four thirty. She would not have that much time to shower and get ready for the evenings activities with Dave at the club. Reluctantly she undressed and headed for the shower.

Among The Missing - part 4 
by Rubberwolf 
Among the Missing Chapter IV by Rubberwolf 
By the time that Ann arrived home, it was well past three thirty.� It was well past four O&#8217;clock by the time she had unloaded her car.� She now sat, staring at a small mountain of various bags and boxes that now littered her bed.� It was time for a coffee.� She also needed to check her e-mails. 
She walked back in to the living room and booted up her PC.� While she was waiting for Windows to load, she walked in to the kitchen and put the kettle on.� A few minutes later she strolled back in to the living room clutching a hot cup of coffee.� Sitting down, she booted up Explorer and browsed through her inbox.� The office had got back to her on the URL addresses that she had sent them and so she downloaded the attached file and opened the contents.� Scanning few the addresses, she could see that there were one or two web pages that were visited quite regularly and so she picked one of the more popular addresses and clicked on to it.� Fortunately, the office had saved the addresses on to a word document and the hyperlinks were active so that, after a slight delay, the web page came up.� She was not surprised at the content and began to flick through the site. 
The web page had the usual pornographic pictures, links and forum.� Idly, Ann scanned through a few of the pictures.� After the events of the past few days, Ann was not surprised to find a familiar twinge in her loins, or the dampness seeping in to her knickers, as she found herself more than a little interested in some of the pictures. 
Coming out of the picture section, she picked a story at random from the latest postings in the packaged section.� After half an hour, she found that, not only had she read the entire story, but that she was feeling incredibly horny. 
Flustered, she clicked on to the forum.� Although she could not log on, she could read the contents.� She had expected dirty old men, or high court judges.� What she found were ordinary people being open about their interest.� By flicking back to the URL addresses and cross matching the dates with the postings on the forum, she was able to identify the screen name of her quarry.� Armed with this new information she started to read all of the postings made under that screen name. 
Having learnt all that she could, she then tried a few other sites.� More story sites, some groups in Yahoo and other sites that require your credit card details before allowing you access.� After nearly an hour, Ann was not surprised to find that her knickers were soaking wet and that she had the urge to play with herself.� An urge that she resisted since, having started this case, she had spent more time enjoying herself than actually working for her client.�� She would, however, revisit some of these sites in her own time.� One piece of information that Ann did find interesting however, was that the last site Nicky had visited advertised holidays on an island off of the west coast.� This destination, if the marketing hype was to be believed, catered for holidaymakers with specific tastes.� Notably, bondage.� She would need to clarify this information, but for the meantime, this seemed a promising lead. 
Having closed down the sites, she returned to her e-mails.� The office had sent her another e-mail.� This time it was the standard background search on the missing person.� Attached were summaries on finances, recent newspaper articles and similar background materials. 
Although specific details could not be obtained from a bank without a warrant, there were other sources that could be approached.� It would amaze most people to know how much information could be collected by marketing companies on buying patterns and lifestyles, such as club memberships, how often a person visits the cinema, or gym, or whether they prefer Italian, or Indian food. 
An hour later she had a very clear picture of how much was spent and what on.� One concern was the amount.� Spending exceeded probable wages considerably.� Her quarry either had a second source of income, or was in considerable debt.� The question was, was the second source legal?� If not, or if she was in sufficient debt, would this prompt her disappearance? 
The newspaper searches were nearly as interesting.� Her client was not the mother; rather she was the stepmother, who had married five years ago.� Her husband had recently died of a heart attack and, if the newspapers were to be believed, had left a considerable fortune.� Scanning the articles, Ann determined that the will would not be read for another two weeks.� This might explain the reason for her employment, or even the disappearance.� Ann was not sure which, but would need to exercise a little caution in the reports that she submitted until she was sure which. 
Checking her watch, Ann noticed how late it had become and so rushed for the bathroom leaving a trail of clothes in her wake as she headed for the shower. 
Fifteen minutes later, Ann stepped out of the shower, towelled herself dry and set to work on the difficult decision of what to wear.� This was, after all, her first time at a fetish club.� However, she needed to fit in.� If she dressed too conservatively she might not fit in.� On the other hand, she might find herself overdressed for the occasion.� In the end, after much rummaging, she decided on a pink, heavily boned rubber corset, with purple trim, with matching knickers.� Following the same theme she also chose pink stockings and opera gloves, with pink and purple stiletto boots in patent leather.� After twenty minutes of struggling and talcum powder she took a cloth and a spray can of silicon and, as the shop assistant had advised, polished her outfit until she was convinced she could see her face in the smooth reflection. 
The final item was the dress.� Although this was a simple sheath dress, with long sleeves, the bottom of the dress was quite narrow and it took her almost ten minutes to wrestle herself in to the garment.� Because she had chosen a corset that left her breasts bare she also had the added difficulty of squeezing her tits in to the snug fitting garment.� However, eventually she was able to pull the zipper up so that her breasts were covered, although the cut of the dress offered any onlooker a very nice cleavage shot.� However, eventually she found herself staring at herself in the purple dress, with pink trim, in her mirror and admiring the way her new clothes and the wonderful curves that she now possessed. 
Ann moved to the dressing table and spent another half an hour experimenting with make up until she had achieved a look that both worked with her colouring and complemented her clothes.� The end result, she had to admit, was decidedly Barbie does bondage.� But she was also pleased with the results.� She felt that, if nothing else, she would fit in at the club quite well. 
Finally, she transferred her purse and keys in to her new, fetish, handbag, which was pink and black patent leather, shaped and laced to look like a corset.� For a final touch and to preserve her modesty while travelling to the club, she donned a white PVC raincoat and pulled the belt tightly around her.� As an afterthought, before leaving, she picked up a pink rubber posture collar.� Although she could not wear this while driving, she had decided that it would match the outfit perfectly.� Finally satisfied, she left her apartment and, with growing confidence in her newly discovered posture, strode towards her car with a resounding �Clack, clack, clack�, from her six inch heels. 
�Walking in heels is an art form, especially when the heels in question are six inches in length.� Normally the weight is distributed relatively evenly.� However, despite choosing boots, she still felt as though she would pitch forward at any moment.� Ann therefore had to assume a posture, which while she understood was in fact upright, still felt as though she was leaning back.� Despite this disorientation, she had, she felt, developed the knack of walking without either tripping over, or looking like a drunken giraffe.� Primarily it involved keeping her legs straight and swinging her hips as she placed one foot in front of another, as though she was walking on a tight rope.� Although her progress was slower than her normal brisk walk, she eventually arrived at her car and climbed in. 
If walking in heels was an art form, then driving in them was a science. Unfortunately, legislative thinking on the control of a motor vehicle tended to view bare feet with scorn, even though it would be less dangerous than trying to control the pedals with a six-inch rod attached to your heel.� Rather than simply moving the ankle, especially in these boots, Ann had to move her entire leg, using the stiletto as a fixed pivot point.� It was, needless to say, a very jerky journey to Dave&#8217;s&#8217; flat.� In fact her driving instructor would have pitched a pink fit if he had seen the murder that Ann was committing on her poor defenceless clutch pedal.� However, despite this, Ann arrived in good time and even managed not to stall the car as she swung in to the parking bay. 
Unlike this morning, Ann felt a little exposed as she walked to the flat.� Earlier, most of the occupants had been out, either at work, school, or shopping.� This evening however, the residents were definitely home.� The evidence of recently played with toys was strewn about the green lawn area, while children zoomed past on their cycles.� Although they did not appear to notice this strangely dressed woman as she hobbled past, there was tangible hate and scorn in the eyes of the mothers who surveyed her progress with open hostility.� The most unsettling reaction came from a group of teen-age boys who marked her progress with a series of whistles and catcalls.� Ann was very relieved when she eventually arrived at the entrance to the flats and made her way, as quickly as she could manage, up the stairs to Dave&#8217;s&#8217; apartment.� 
Dave was dressed, as she had expected, in rubber.� He had again chosen black for his colour scheme.� However, rather than the all encasing suit that she had seen earlier, he was now attired in a variety of straps and buckles that, while defying the imagination in their complexity, looked very good on him.� As before, he wore a pair of heavy rubber boots.� This time however, they were knee high and, like the rest of his outfit, were adorned with straps and buckles.� They were also finished with chrome plating on the toe and leg, reminding her of the sort of outfits worn in low budget eighties post apocalypse movies.� The type where all of the major cities have been reduced to rubble, the country side is a desert, the populous cherish dog food when they can get it, but there are still alternative fashion shops and bright make up, as well as hair dies in abundance. 
In any event, Ann was pleased with Dave&#8217;s&#8217; appearance.� He had obviously gone to a lot of trouble and he did look good in a dog collar, especially this one, with its&#8217; six inch nails.� Dave, she noticed, was also appraising her outfit and was pleased, she believed, to see a look of satisfaction, or approval, in his face. 
Dave invited her in and, once he had taken her coat and bag, led her in to the living room where they cracked open a bottle of wine, while Dave explained about the club and the rules of conduct pertaining to guests. 
�Unfortunately the club is quite particular on guests.� You may attend up to three times as a guest before applying for membership.� Each guest must be accompanied by a member and,� Dave hesitated a moment before continuing, �You must be in bondage.� 
Ann stared at him blankly before asking the obvious question. 
�What sort of bondage?� 
�The first time that you go to the club they expect you to have your hands bound.� You should also be gagged and be attached to the member by a chain.� The owners believe that, in this way, you will get in to the spirit of things quickly.� Also, if you happen to be a cop, then the club can rightly claim that you were participating in the activities, rather than observing them.� Once you have been three times, you can become a member and, as such dress as you please.� 
Ann considered this for a moment.� She had to admit that it made sense.� But what sort of activities happened in the club that would warrant police scrutiny? 
�OK� But how am I going to mingle, or even ask questions, if I am being led about like a tethered goat, especially wearing a gag?� 
�I have thought about that.� The best way is for you to write the questions down before we go.� That way I can make enquiries and you can observe.� If you notice anything, or want to ask specific questions, you can pop to the ladies room where you&#8217;re allowed out of your restraints.� That way you can write down what you want to say so that I can act on it.� How does that sound?� 
Ann wasn&#8217;t sure. 
�Look, I do this for a living.� I&#8217;m not sure you would know what to do, or what to look for, even with me there.� 
Dave seemed to consider this for a moment before reaching some sort of decision. 
�Look, I wasn&#8217;t altogether honest with you earlier about my job.� I am a cop.� I know how to ask questions.� I could probably go in by myself, but it&#8217;s your case.� Also, having you along would give me extra credibility without instantly arousing suspicions.� 
Ann considered this for several moments before eventually accepting.� After all, she could see why a cop would not want to announce himself, given his tastes and the damage that Ann could do to his career.� As if to underline her decision, she walked over to where she had left her coat and retrieved the posture collar from the discrete carrier bag that it was brought in.� 
�Just as well I thought to bring this along,� she announced, brandishing the garment, �Since I am expected to be lead around by you.� Look, it even has a little loop to attach a chain.� 
Dave&#8217;s&#8217; grin split his face in two as he walk over to her and placed the collar around her throat and doing up the laces.� Although Ann had an idea of what it would feel like, especially since her earlier costume change, this particular item was far more rigid than she was comfortable with.� It was, in fact, quite severe, forcing her head back tightly.� 
Dave walked in to the bedroom, leaving her standing in this uncomfortable position.� She could not move, easily, since her head was forced backwards and so she was forced to stand and wait, examining the ceiling, until Dave&#8217;s&#8217; return.� 
After a few moments Ann heard him walking towards her and looked down.� He moved in to her line of sight, since she could not turn her head without moving her entire body, before she felt her hair pulled roughly back.� 
�Oww� 
�Open wide,� Dave announced as she noticed something flash past her vision. 
�That hurts.� What are ynghh.� 
Ann&#8217;s&#8217; mouth was suddenly full of something.� It was a large round something and Ann could feel straps dangling down the side of her face.� The pressure on her hair was released and Ann saw Dave gather the straps and pull them over the top of her head.� It was, Ann guessed, a harness of some sort that, as far as she could tell, ran in an inverted Y shape from the edges of the gag to the bridge of her nose, where a steel look connected to more straps that ran over her head.� She could still feel other straps hanging from the ball in her mouth.� Dave stepped behind her, gathering these, before tightening them behind her.� Ann felt another strap running under her jaw.� Dave stepped around beside her, and she felt the jaw strap tighten as Dave unbuckled and pull on another strap that ran along her cheek before re-securing it.� She was now, Ann felt, well and truly gagged.� She could not open her jaw at all. 
Satisfied with this, Dave returned his attention to the collar, pulling tightly on the laces.� Although she had noticed the strange protrusion under the chin, she had only theoretically accepted its&#8217; purpose.� This became clear as Dave tightened the straps again and her head was pushed back even further.� Although it did not impede her breathing, she still felt very constricted.� It was now impossible for her to move her head from side to side, or to lower her head. 
Dave left her again, returning some moments later.� Ann grunted as she felt her arms pulled tightly behind her and forced in to what she now knew to be a single glove, a device that would encase her arms completely, from her wrists, up to her elbows.� He then fed a strap from one side of the glove over her shoulder, passing it through a metal loop in her collar, before feeding the end over her left shoulder and buckling it tightly in place to the other side of the glove.� 
After buckling more straps around her wrist and elbows, pulling the latter so tight that her elbows touched, she discovered that this, like her collar, had laces that ran the entire length of the restraint.� Dave applied the same attention to detail on these laces, encasing her arms in a tight embrace that it would be impossible for her to escape from. 
Finally, after collecting his coat, he attached a dog lead to her collar and lead her towards the door, leaving her own coat and bag, where she had left them earlier.� Ann tried to protest.� She could not go out like this, but Dave was insistent, tugging on her leash with a force that caused her to stagger until she submitted to the humiliation of being displayed like a captive slave. 
If the stairs had been a challenge before, they were now an Olympic event.� However, with Dave&#8217;s support, she eventually made it to the bottom of the stairs.� Not allowing her to catch her breath, or re-consider, Dave pulled on her leash, forcing her to stagger out in to the dying sun light of the estate.� 
Although only an hour had passed, the streets were now mercifully empty of mothers and children.� However, the knot of boys who had taunted her upon her arrival were still there and so were their taunts and insults.� Although she had successfully ignored their insults before, she found that, now she was bound and gagged, the charges of whore, accompanied by the inevitable enquiries about price, cut her to the core as she wrestled against the accusations.� Although she could shut out their insults, they still cut her deeply. 
After an eternity, they eventually arrived at the car.� But instead of opening the passenger door, Dave lead her to the rear of the vehicle.� Ann looked at Dave quizzically as he opened the boot.� In answer to her unspoken question, Ann was suddenly bowled off of her feet as Dave shoved her roughly in to the boot and slammed it shut. 
Ann struggled against her bonds as she writhed to find a comfortable place amongst the confines of the dark compartment, mumbling unutterable curses in to her gag, as she angrily questioned Dave&#8217;s&#8217; parentage and relationship with his right hand.� This, she realised, was futile and so started kicking the sides of her prison to let her captor know exactly what she thought of the travel arrangements.� The only response that she received from Dave was when he started the car engine and reversed out of the parking bay. 
Ann was not sure how long the drive lasted.� Even if she could see her watch, which she had not worn this evening, her pitch-black prison would have robbed its usefulness.� She tried to listen to the noises of the car as it travelled.� She was able to identify junctions, as the car slowed, stopped and accelerated.� The long, unbroken hum, produced by the car was almost certainly a motorway.� However, after a while, her mind began to wander as her imagination began to explore her predicament and its potential outcome.� In fact, her mind was so busy speculating that she did not notice the car stop or the engine being turned off.� The first inkling she had that they might have reached their destination came when Dave opened the boot. 
Dave reached in to the boot, grabbing his captive roughly as he pulled her in to a sitting position.� Then with a little effort, he was able to swing her boots over the rim, so that they dangled in mid air, before grabbing her around the waist and pulling her towards him.� Ann fell in to Dave&#8217;s arms as she struggled to gain her balance.� Although the drive had disoriented her however, she was soon able to regain her composure and take in her new surroundings.� 
She appeared to be in an industrial park.� Large impressive buildings and warehouses surrounded her as she stood in a large car park.� Unfortunately, it was paved with gravel and Ann winced at the prospect of negotiating her way across it in heels.� Ann lost her balance momentarily as Dave dragged her towards a large, but none the less, nondescript warehouse.�

Among The Missing
Chapter 5
By
Rubberwolf &copy; 2007

Ann tumbled out of the boot, supported by Dave and, after clearing her vision following the comparative darkness of the car boot, tried to take in her surroundings.&nbsp; She appeared to be in an industrial estate.&nbsp; 

Dave grabbed the lead that was dangling between her breasts and started to drag her towards one of the industrial units.&nbsp; It was, Ann considered, quite large.&nbsp; Perhaps it was a warehouse.&nbsp; However, only half of her attention was now on her surroundings, as she began to stumble on the loose grave of the car park.&nbsp; Whoever decided that this was a good road surface had never tried to negotiate it in heals, especially heals this tall.&nbsp; However, eventually, after a little difficulty and a lot of support from Dave, she made it in to the lobby of the club.

 The lobby was not what she had expected.&nbsp; She had envisioned something grubby, or even an old company reception.&nbsp; What she found was a well furnished and decorated interior, similar to an old cinema building, or private club.&nbsp; The walls were coloured a deep, rich red, with what looked like material of some kind.&nbsp; Gold painted moulding formed a rich boarder for pictures that would have been more at home on the top shelf of a newsagent.&nbsp; The receptionist however, was more of what she would have expected.&nbsp; She wore a brightly coloured rubber sheath dress that hobbled her legs and left nothing to the imagination above the waste.&nbsp; 

Dave booked them in and then led her to a set of double doors.

�Ready?� he asked.&nbsp; 

Ann was still unsure as to whether this would actually work.&nbsp; True, David was a serving Police man and would be used to ferreting for clues, but his sort of work and hers were still different enough for her to envision all manner of problems.&nbsp; However it was too late now and so she simply nodded, prompting Dave to push open the doors and drag her inside by the lead that was still attached to her throat.

On the way over here, from Dave&#8217;s flat, as she lay curled up in the boot of his car, Ann had thought she knew what to expect.&nbsp; When she had stepped into the plush foyer she had amended her ideas and had formed a detailed picture in her mind of the sort of club that she was being dragged into.&nbsp; Both visions, she now realised as she was assaulted by a wave of noise, colour and movement, were so inconceivably wrong as to take her breath away.&nbsp; If she was not gagged already she would have stood and gawped with her mouth open like some teen aged girl on her first visit to Soho.&nbsp; As it was, the gag and Dave tugging on her leash saved her any embarrassment that may have occurred from looking like a yokel in the big city for the fist time.

Loud music buffeted her senses.&nbsp; She was not sure what it was.&nbsp; Some form of rock, punk techno stuff.&nbsp; Whatever it was, it was appropriate, Ann realised.&nbsp; The red and gold theme had continued throughout.&nbsp; But rather than looking stately, or even trashy, it had managed a balance of the two, sort of a royal knocking shop.&nbsp; A large stage dominated the centre of a sea of tables, with what she assumed was a dance floor off to one side of the stage.&nbsp; Bright lights danced over this strange tableau, highlighting details in this otherwise darkened room.&nbsp; Flashing lights and strobes picked out a cage hanging from the ceiling with a naked woman inside.&nbsp; A man, who was dressed in only a leather thong had been gagged and was now suspended between two pillars on the stage in a perverse X, while a high healed, rubber clad Dom whipped him from behind, dominated the stage.&nbsp; Their partners led around other women, in a similar position to hers.&nbsp; Looking up she could sea both men and women suspended from the ceiling in a variety of manners.&nbsp; And all around her, a vast throng of people milled around in varied states of undress, bondage or, well she was not sure what else.&nbsp; 

As Ann scanned the room she noticed that what she had first taken to be wide screen television sets, scattered on the wall around the room, were in fact large windows that showed the occupants of brightly lit rooms.&nbsp; In one room a dom was punishing her female slave.&nbsp; The mostly naked girl swung like a perverse pendulum as she hung helplessly, her wrists lashed together and tied to a hook in the ceiling, while her toes desperately pointed to the floor that was an infinitely small number of inches from offering her body any support.&nbsp; The rubber clad dom swinging her prey with a forceful shove before stepping back, unfurling a whip.&nbsp; Ann could not watch the obvious outcome.&nbsp; The terror in the girls&#8217; eyes was testament enough.

�Oh my, we are not in Kansas now Toto,� Ann thought to herself as Dave pulled her to the bar, which dominated a wall to the right of the entrance.

Dave shouted something at the bar man and then took two drinks as they were handed over.&nbsp; One was definitely a pint of beer.&nbsp; She could not tell what the other one was, as it was contained in the type of bottle that outdoors types use while jogging, or cycling.

Dave tugged Ann over to a vacant table before putting the drinks down.&nbsp; He then sat down and beckoned Ann to join him and so she gingerly squeezed into the booth next to him.

�Lets see if we can&#8217;t make you a little more comfortable,� Dave shouted into her ear as he undid the gag.&nbsp; Although the head harness remained in place, Dave was able to undo the straps and remove the ball gag completely.&nbsp; �Better?� he asked as Ann worked her jaw around.&nbsp; 

Once she was certain that she could work her jaw properly, she was able to answer him.

�Yes thanks,� she stated, a little croakily.

Taking his cue, Dave lifted Ann&#8217;s drink and placed the straw in her mouth.&nbsp; After a few gulps she released the straw.

�What do you think?� Dave asked excitedly, obviously wanting her to approve of the club.

�It&#8217;s great,� Ann enthused.&nbsp; �I had no idea that this place existed, or that it could exist.�

Encouraged by Anns reaction, Dave continued to tell her all about the club and some of its members.&nbsp; After fifteen or twenty minutes, Ann had finished her drink and Dave replaced the gag.&nbsp; Once secured, Dave pulled on her leash, signalling that it was time for her to slide out of the booth and commence work.

Despite her reservations, Ann was pleased by the arrangement.&nbsp; Although she was not able to directly communicate, Ann was able to write tips, or observations when she visited the ladies, or conduct a more detailed observation when they retired to the bar for a drink.&nbsp; However, by 11:30 they were still no nearer finding their quarry.&nbsp; That is until they met Ms Rochford.&nbsp; 

Ms Rochford was one of the few women that Ann would have to crane her neck to look up to.&nbsp; In her bare feet she would have towered over most women, measuring at least six feet high.&nbsp; With the addition of six-inch heels Ann had no hope of meeting this womans gaze on an equal par.&nbsp; As if the height were not enough, Ms Rochford had obviously been to the gymnasium and not just for the usual aerobics classes either.&nbsp; These factors, combined with her long blond hair, severely pinned and tied into a strict bun and her choice of glossy black cat suite were enough to scream into the ear of any interested observer that this woman was your worst nightmare in dominant, Amazonian, Norse goddesses.&nbsp; For the second time in the same evening, Ann was spared the embarrassment of her jaw hanging open and a gee golly expression by the fact that she was securely gagged.&nbsp; Luckily Dave seemed to know her and he was quickly able to steer the conversation around to the missing girl.

�No I haven&#8217;t seen her recently, but then I am not surprised.�

�Why&#8217;s that?� Dave enquired.

�She said something about family troubles.&nbsp; She needed to disappear for a while.�

Ann watched as Dave tried not to let excitement enter his voice as he asked the question that they had spent the evening trying to answer.

�I might know where she went,� Ms Rochford considered.&nbsp; �But if I help you with your problem, I would like some help in return,� she purred.

�And what problem would that be?�&nbsp; Dave asked with the smuggest expression that Ann had ever seen.&nbsp; 

Ann tried not to smile as Dave&#8217;s smugness was whipped from his face as he realised that the help Ms Rochford wanted was nothing to do with his male charms.

&nbsp; �I had a little something planned for the stage act this evening, But one of my slaves is sick.&nbsp; The little whore has done this to spite me, I swear.&nbsp; But it has ruined my plans.�

�That is unfortunate,� Dave mused, �But I still don&#8217;t see how I can help.�

�It&#8217;s quite simple.&nbsp; If you lend me your slave for the show, I will tell you what I know.�
Dave seemed to consider this, But surreptitiously made eye contact with Ann.&nbsp; It was obviously her call and he was asking what she wanted to do.

Ann thought furiously.&nbsp; Until they had run into Ms Rochford, Ann had begun to lose hope of finding anything useful.&nbsp; Although fun, Ann would have wasted an entire evening.&nbsp; This might be their only chance and she was becoming desperate, not to mention uncomfortable. Her feet and shoulders were killing her.&nbsp; She longed to stretch her jaw.&nbsp; She would have done anything in that moment to shorten the evening and so she nodded to Dave who, seeing that she had accepted the offer, passed Ann&#8217;s lead to the tall dominatrix.

A look of triumph crossed over the tall woman&#8217;s face as she clasped the leash.

�Very well, I will tell you all that I know after I have finished with your pet, she smirked as she tugged roughly on the lead, pulling Ann forward and off of balance, so that she stumbled forward and her new mistress spun on her heal and dragged her prize towards the rear of club.

Ann was led behind the stage to one of the changing rooms, which was already occupied by another girl, who was bound and gagged.&nbsp; The girl wore a black rubber corset and stockings, but nothing else.&nbsp; Ann could not gauge the look that the girl gave her as she was dragged into the room, but it made Ann feel distinctly uncomfortable.

The room was, by any stretch of the imagination, quite Spartan.&nbsp; Despite a large mirror that dominated one entire wall, there seemed little else that one would expect to see in a dressing room.&nbsp; Rather, judging by the bondage paraphernalia scattered around the room, this was more of a holding cell, or worse, a playroom. 

Ms Rochford hung Ann&#8217;s lead on a hook, high up on the wall, as though she were tethering a horse, or a pet.&nbsp; Before Ann could speculate further on her fate, or the other girl, her mistress spun her around, so that she faced the wall.

�Lets see if we can make your stay with us more comfortable shall we?� Ms Rochford purred as she began to undo the arm binder.

After a couple of minutes Ms Rochford had succeeded in unpicking the laces and freeing her arms.&nbsp; Ann had not noticed how painful the arm binder had become until sensation returned to her arms.&nbsp; However, before she could take advantage of her new found freedom, Ms Rochford had succeeded in pulling Ann&#8217;s arms out of the dress and re-fastening them, behind her back, with a set of thick leather cuffs.&nbsp; These, Ann now saw, came from a duffel bag lying on the floor next to the other girl.&nbsp; However, it was still an improvement over the strains imposed by the arm binder and at least Ann could now flex her elbows.&nbsp; Her comfort was short lived as her mistress produced a rubber strap from the bag, which she used to cinch Ann&#8217;s elbows tightly together.&nbsp; Ann could not understand why the woman had unbound her arms, only to re-bind them, though she was quite sure that she would soon find out.

Next Ms Rochford removed her knickers and dress before fastening her legs together at the ankle and knee with two thick rubber straps.&nbsp; Finally the gag was removed.&nbsp; Ann Worked her jaw, to work out the kinks.

�Thank you that was Mmmphf.�

Ann&#8217;s gratitude was cut short as a new gag harness was strapped to her head.&nbsp; This was different to the other gags that Ann had worn.&nbsp; Not only did it have a penis on the inside of the gag.&nbsp; It also had a penis on the outside.&nbsp; Ann had, in an instant, literally been transformed into a dick head.&nbsp; Ms Rochford then attached another strap to the top of the head harness.&nbsp; The other end of the strap was fed through the elbow straps and buckled tightly in place, forcing Ann to tilt her head backwards and look up at the ceiling.

Her new mistress unhooked her from the wall, attached a new chain to her collar, which, after forcing Ann to bend over, she snapped onto a D ring on the ankle straps.&nbsp; Ann shrieked as something cold and wet was smeared across her cunt.&nbsp; Ann was then picked up by the muscular Amazon and manoeuvred backwards until she could feel something press against her pussy.&nbsp; Although she could feel her feet scrape across the floor, she was powerless to resist as her mistress impaled her on something hard and unyielding.&nbsp; Ann felt impaled by the strange intruder.&nbsp; It must have been twelve inches long and have a diameter of three inches.&nbsp; Ann considered her position before coming to the conclusion that Ms Rochford had somehow mounted a large dildo onto the wall.&nbsp; Although she was still able to move forward and backwards, Ann was not about to challenge the will of the woman who had placed her there by foolishly trying to move and so Ann stayed still, impaled to the wall of a perverted lesbians play room and waited to discover her fate.

She did not have long to wait, as her mistress strode across the room, unhooked the other girl, bound her in a similar position and, after smearing some sort of paste that Ann assumed must be KY jelly, before picking the girl up and carrying her towards Ann.

Ann shook her head and tried to protest into the gag as Ms Rochfords intentions became plane, but it was useless and Ann had no choice as the other girls ass loomed closer and closer until her pussy became impaled onto Anns gag in the same manner that Ann was impaled on the wall.
Next, Ms Rochford took out a strange set of chains, that formed an X, perhaps two feet in length, as she held them up Ann noticed as she tried to shift her eyes to the left.&nbsp; That was all that she saw before her mistress bent down and disappeared from view.

Moments later the other girl squirmed and bucked, smothering Ann and forcing her anus into Ann&#8217;s nose.&nbsp; A short time later Ann discovered why as something hard was clamped firstly to her left and then right nipple.&nbsp; Ann could not see but the chains had joined both women painfully together.&nbsp; Another chain, attached to the centre of the X was fed between Ann&#8217;s legs and clipped onto a small ring in the wall.&nbsp; This would offer some movement, but if Ann moved too far she would cause pain to both women.&nbsp; It also meant that she could not now pull away from the wall.

�Your not due on stage for a while yet, so why don&#8217;t you two enjoy yourselves until you are needed,� purred their captor as she strode from the room.

Ann had no intention of enjoying herself, even if she could find a way to achieve such a goal, given her current position.&nbsp; This was degrading, perverted and�

Ann&#8217;s thoughts were rudely interrupted as, to Ann&#8217;s total astonishment and horror, the other girl began to rock backwards and forwards, fucking her face and forcing Ann to rock backwards and forwards as well, forcing her to pleasure herself on her own dildo.

�Ait.&nbsp; Att R Ue ooin.&nbsp; Op Naaa,� Ann screamed, but it was useless and as the girls juices assaulted her senses and the intruder in her pussy began to have its own effect, Ann&#8217;s protests turned to moans as she surrendered to the other girls passions.

On the other side of the one way mirror, Dave watched with some amusement, along with a growing crowd of spectators, as the two women fucked themselves into frenzy.

Ann had lost all sense of time.&nbsp; Although she had some idea of how late it was when she was with Dave, she was no longer capable of judging.&nbsp; This would be understandable.&nbsp; Her hands were tied behind her back and her head was fastened so that she had to keep her head tilted back at an extreme angle.&nbsp; A leash pulled her body into the horizontal her legs were bound together and she was wearing high heels.&nbsp; If this was not enough of a distraction, since her back was now very painful and she had lost sensation in her arms, she was also forced to fuck a wall mounted dildo, that had some sort of nub, or ridge that also teased her clit.&nbsp; Very distracting.&nbsp; But not as much as the fact that she was wearing a penis gag, that incidentally had a large exterior penis protruding out of it and a similarly tethered girl who was, at this moment, thrusting her ass, for all she was worth, backwards and forwards, fucking the dildo gag and Ann&#8217;s face, while she pleasured herself, forcing Ann to rock backwards and forwards on her own impalement.&nbsp; Oh and if this was not enough, a set of chains ran through the other girls legs, painfully attaching Ann&#8217;s nipples to the other girls, so that as she rocked backwards and forwards, her breasts swayed, tugging Ann&#8217;s nipples painfully and forcing her to shriek in pain and pleasure as she lost herself, her identity, her sense of time and being in the moment, since her world now consisted of a rubber clad woman, with a beautiful ass that filled her vision and assaulted her senses with powerful scents as it was forced into her face and causing Ann to thrust her own ass forward and backward on a rubber cock.

�Oh God,� and grunted for the thousandth time as her legs nearly buckled.

Her pussy was now raw from its rough treatment.&nbsp; Her nose, she was sure, must now have a small dimple battered into it, the exact size and shape of the other girls sphincter and then the other girl stopped and a hand stocked her sweating flank.&nbsp; 

�Did you enjoy yourselves while I was away?� Ms Rochford asked.&nbsp; �I am sorry I took so long, but it took me a longer than I expected to set everything up,� she explained as she began to release the two girls.

To Ann&#8217;s surprise, the other girl shuddered as the nipple chain was unclipped.&nbsp; Ann thought she heard the other girl shriek into a gag.&nbsp; Ann could not understand why this was until her own nipples were released and blood flowed back into her tortured flesh.&nbsp; Ann screamed into the gag and tears welled up in her eyes as that awful woman massaged her agonised nipples as feeling returned in a great torrent of pain and tears.&nbsp; Eventually, however, Ann was released, although she could hardly stand, her mistress led her onto the stage.&nbsp; 

Ann was in a daze as her rubberized legs barely held her up the stairs.&nbsp; Although her hands were still tied behind her back, all other restraints were removed.&nbsp; A head harness had now replaced the penis gag.&nbsp; Now, instead of a gag, her mouth was held open by an O-ring, which, if her oral explorations were correct, was made of metal and surrounded in plastic.&nbsp; Despite her dazed condition, Ann was still alert enough to be shocked by the site that greeted her on stage.&nbsp; 

A large metal wheel had been set up, so that it stood, vertically, on its own.&nbsp; Ann noticed a box on the floor and others at the top and sides of the square frame that the wheel passed through.&nbsp; The rim was bisected by two, parallel, steel bars, which had a hub of some sort in the centre.&nbsp; The crowning glory of this weird contraption was the girl that Ann had just been so intimate with.&nbsp; She had been attached to the wheel by hard looking iron manacles, one for each ankle and wrist.&nbsp; The ankle manacles were attached to one of the steel bars so that the girl was forced to spread her legs as far apart as they would go.&nbsp; Rubber straps were attached to the bar and secured her upper thighs.&nbsp; The other manacles were bolted onto the inside of the wheel so that the girl&#8217;s arms were flung apart at an angle 45 degrees from the vertical.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two chains ran from the head harness and attached to the same bolts that held the wrist restraints, keeping the girls head firmly facing forward.&nbsp; Heavy looking weights had been clamped onto her nipples.&nbsp; She also wore a ring gag similar, if not the same as Ann&#8217;s.&nbsp; The most worrying thing however was between her legs.&nbsp; The hub at the centre of the wheel reminded her of a car jack, with the same threaded central bar and joints.&nbsp; Some sort of weights had been attached to the side and a sinister looking shaft protruded upwards into the girls already sopping pussy.&nbsp; 

Before Ann had had a chance to discover what this meant, the wheel was rotated, so that the girl, was held upside down.&nbsp; Ann was then led up, onto a platform on the other side of the wheel.&nbsp; Despite a few token noises of protest, Ann soon found herself in a similar position, except facing the other way.&nbsp; Ms Rochford approached Ann with a confident swagger, a large menacing looking dildo in her hand.

�Well, how are you enjoying yourself?� she smirked as she bent down and shoved the dildo firmly into Ann&#8217;s pussy.

Ann didn&#8217;t even bother trying to protest, merely grunting at the rough intrusion, as Ms Rochford fiddled with the dildo and, so Ann imagined, attached it to the hub that she had pondered earlier.

�Good girl,� Ms Rochford cooed as she attached a painful clip to her already agonised nipple.

�Nggh, Argggh,� Ann cried as the first clip bit into her swollen nipple and a heavy weight stretched her swollen flesh.&nbsp; Ann thought she had shed enough tears tonight, but could do nothing as salty water began to flow down her cheeks as the second nipple weight was clamped in place.&nbsp; 

Ms Rochford smiled and bent down, grabbing Ann&#8217;s jaw firmly in her hand, she held the already immobile girl as she bent down and forced her tong down Ann&#8217;s throat that Ann, at first tried to resist but, almost against her will, found her treacherous tong responding hungrily as a tingling in her pussy announced that she was, in fact, enjoying this and then she was gone, striding confidently away as two stage hands brought a pair of brightly coloured wooden steps to either side of the wheel.&nbsp; 

Ann did not have long to consider her predicament, or what the steps might be used for, since it was definitely show time.&nbsp; Ann closed her eyes and tried to turn her head away from the bright lights that had suddenly erupted all around her.&nbsp; As if she was not disoriented enough, she felt the wheel move around her.&nbsp; Ann&#8217;s eyes shot open, momentarily blinding her as, with sudden realisation she found that, not only was the wheel moving, but the dildo, which had been forced deep within her pussy was not only vibrating, but withdrawing from her. 

Ann was not sure how the dildos were aligned to the wheel.&nbsp; There was obviously some switch, or mechanism tied to the wheel that brought the dildos to life within her.&nbsp; The buzzing intruders moved up and down within her as the wheel moved.&nbsp; The shaft withdrew until it was in danger of popping out of her, before gliding inside and filling her to the point of pain.&nbsp; The wheels rotation seemed to match this, so that, as Ann was rotated slowly around she felt the intruder complete its linear motion twice to match a full rotation.&nbsp; She supposed that the other girl was being invaded in a similar manner.&nbsp; Perhaps, as Ann&#8217;s cock withdrew, another, similar intruder filled her companion.

The weights on her nipples were being rotated painfully as both they and her breasts, were pulled by gravity into a graceful circle.&nbsp; Ann stared straight ahead as she concentrated on not being sick as she was spun around, on not crying with the pain from her nipples and, and, and a familiar sensation started to build between her legs.

�Oh my god,� an thought as the world turned upside down once more and she noticed the curtains begin to open, �I have already been rubbed raw.&nbsp; I will be rubbed raw if I have to go any, any, oh yes just there, mmmm�.&nbsp; 

Ann began to lose concentration as she was rotated, she noticed, faster and faster and the intruder started to have a familiar effect on her body.&nbsp; Ann was aware of a figure striding out onto the stage in front of her, clad in a black, shiny cat suite.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t Ms Rochford, she was sure.&nbsp; But she did not have time to contemplate as her body took her towards climax.

The figure in front of her raised her right arm over her head and then brought it down sharply.

�Crack.�

Ann flinched at the sharp sound, but did not feel any pain.&nbsp; Something long and rope like, a whip probably, reached between her legs, but did not touch her.&nbsp; It was too low to have touched her.&nbsp; The other girl perhaps?

�Crack.�

Ann flinched as pain erupted in a neat line across her ass.&nbsp; She had not seen the woman in front of her wield the whip.&nbsp; That had to mean that someone else was behind her.&nbsp; As she started to worry about the implications of this, the woman in front of her flicked her weapon and, or so Ann felt, the frame definitely shuddered a little below her.

�Crack.�

More pain caused her to jerk and writhe as, even as her mind became focused on the next fall of the whip, her body began to climax.

�Crack, Crack, Crack,� the punishment began to mirror the rotations of the wheel as the woman behind her abused Ann&#8217;s ass.&nbsp; Ann imagined how she must look, to the audience.&nbsp; Bound, abused, vulnerable and.

Ann let out a primal scream that was more of a groan.&nbsp; Something base and primitive that would not have been out of place in some far distant jungle populated by our furthest ancestors.&nbsp; This was nothing to do with pain.&nbsp; This was lust.&nbsp; This was sex.&nbsp; This was, well the Earth was definitely moving for Ann.

�Good evening ladies, Gentlemen, Masters and Slaves.�&nbsp; Tonight, Ms Rochford has kindly brought along her spin dryer for your entertainment.&nbsp; If anybody needs anything washing, please form into two orderly cues at the foot of the stage.�

Ann didn&#8217;t have time to contemplate this as her body was rocked by another orgasm and then another.&nbsp; Her ass must be red raw by now.&nbsp; But she didn&#8217;t care.&nbsp; More orgasms rocked her body and then she was not sure.&nbsp; She was no longer moving.&nbsp; Her eyes focused and she saw that the wheel had stopped so that she was on her side.&nbsp; A man dressed in leather was walking towards her and opening his fly.&nbsp; Others were behind him and heading in her direction.&nbsp; Then she felt a hand caressing her tit.

�Suck it bitch.&nbsp; Give him the best blow job he has ever had, or I will turn your ass in to quivering, bloody, sushi,� Ms Rochford purred into her ear.

This shocked Ann, she didn&#8217;t know what to do, or think.&nbsp; But then the decision was already made for her.&nbsp; She was helpless and the ring gag held her mouth open.&nbsp; Her head was restrained and then her vision was full of tight leather and cock.&nbsp; A cock, which soon filled, not just her vision, but also her mouth.&nbsp; The man pushed his member deep into her throat.&nbsp; Last week she might have gagged but now, thanks to Dave, she had learnt to accept and literally swallow.&nbsp; The man withdrew and then forced his hips forward with such speed that Ann was nearly caught off guard.

�Oh well,� Ann thought, �In for a penny,� as she started to service, given her limitations, the member as best she could.

The man was not like the usual blowjobs that she had given so far.&nbsp; It was more like she was just there as a receptacle.&nbsp; A soft, wet hole to be fucked, which is exactly what the man did until he stopped sharply, before his member shuddered with a familiar vibration and filled her mouth with his seed.

The next man in the queue was not interested in her mouth, concentrating instead on her breast.&nbsp; Positioning his member so that it slid, after a little lubrication, between her breasts, which he squeezed together with his hands as her began to move his cock forward and backwards.&nbsp; Eventually he shot his load all over her breasts before standing to one side to allow the next man in line to have his turn.

Eventually, after servicing eleven men and licking one woman into an orgasm, Ms Rochford announced that her slaves had become quite wet and needed drying off.&nbsp; Ann had to admit this was true.&nbsp; She had come all over her face, her hair and her breasts.&nbsp; As soon as this announcement had been made the wheel started to spin again.&nbsp; Ann now knew why this was called the spin dryer.&nbsp; As the wheel picked up speed she could actually feel the cum drying on her skin.

After, she guessed, five minutes of spinning, whipping and orgasms, the wheel was stopped and she was forced, once again, to serve as a receptacle for the lusts of her fellow guests.&nbsp; She lost count of the amount of cocks that she had spurt on, or in her.&nbsp; She thought she recognised Dave, but could not be sure.&nbsp; She thought that she had been spun six times.

Eventually the act came to an end and she was released from the wheel.&nbsp; Her once pink outfit was now covered in cum, while her face, hair and body were caked in dried on layers of jism.&nbsp; Her ass felt pealed, but as she was released, she felt behind her, but could find no blood.&nbsp; She probably had red welts, but they had not broken the surface.&nbsp; She tried to take a step, but staggered and nearly fell.&nbsp; She was led from the stage by Ms Rochford and two women, each grabbing an arm and virtually carrying her away.&nbsp; 

She was returned to the small room she had occupied earlier.&nbsp; She was helped back into her clothes, her arms were forced into the arm binder she had started the evening wearing and she was re-united with her own gag.&nbsp; Then the dog lead was attached and she was pulled out of the room and into the club.

Ms Rochford seemed to have a radar and easily spotted Dave.&nbsp; She marched confidently up to him and handed him Ann&#8217;s leash.

�Thank you for the loan of your slave.&nbsp; She is in the same condition that you gave her to me in, apart from needing a bath.�

�And the information you promised?� Dave enquired as he took the leash from the other woman.

�Oh yes, the girl.&nbsp; She has slaved for me once or twice, although she is more disposed as a Dom.&nbsp; She mentioned that she had some sort of family trouble and that she needed to get away.&nbsp; I think she said she would probably hide out at The Island.&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t normally give out this information, but since I have seen you together before.�

That seemed to be all the information that the woman was prepared to give and after exchanging pleasantries parted.&nbsp; There seemed little point in staying after that and Dave led Ann out to the car, where he undid her arms and took out the gag.

�I think you might have had enough bondage for one night,� Dave announced as he released her.

Ann worked her jaw.&nbsp; She did not want to talk.&nbsp; What she had just done, or allowed to happen to her.&nbsp; Last week she would not have allowed such an assault.&nbsp; What was happening to her she was not sure.&nbsp; But she needed to get home.&nbsp; She needed a shower.&nbsp; 

Although Dave filled her in on the island, she was listening with only half an ear.&nbsp; It was, apparently, a fetish haven Off of the West coast.&nbsp; A former fishing community that had been brought by an eccentric millionaire back in the fifties.&nbsp; It had since evolved into a sort of bondage, fetish, paradise of some sort.&nbsp; Apparently you could book holidays on the Island, while being assured of total discretion.&nbsp; The perfect place to disappear apparently.&nbsp; Dave was verbally beating himself up for not thinking of it sooner.

Ann made all the right noises, kissed Dave goodnight and then drove home, where she spent forty minutes in the shower scrubbing cum off of her body and out of her hair.&nbsp; By the time she stepped out of the shower, her eyes were red from crying.&nbsp; What sort of a slut was she becoming?&nbsp; Why hadn&#8217;t she displayed this wanton behaviour before?&nbsp; Ann did not know.&nbsp; But she had a great deal of thinking to do and so, after drying her hair, she crawled into bed and tried to sleep.

Among The Missing 
Chapter 7
By Rubberwolf

It was late when Ann arrived home.&nbsp; It had been a long night.&nbsp; Her feet were killing her.&nbsp; Although women were heals all day, most days.&nbsp; A night spent standing up, wearing six inch stilettos is still murder, no matter what anybody says.&nbsp; If she had really thought about her evening she would have bought a pack of �Party Feet.�&nbsp; However, it was a very tired and saw woman who collapsed onto the sofa and removed her boots and rubber stockings.&nbsp; The relief was instantaneous.&nbsp; Like a cool breeze caressing her legs, after the hot and sweaty confinement of her rubber stockings.&nbsp; Next came the opera gloves, which she pealed off with a distinct �Schluppp,� as the sodden rubber was pealed away from her arms.&nbsp; 

Leaning forward she managed to reach behind her and gradually undo her corset which, despite being loosened, clung to her skin, adhered by sticky sweat and cum.&nbsp; Removing the final items of clothing, Ann eventually sat in her living room, naked, enjoying the feeling of cool air on her skin as the sweat evaporated off of her body.&nbsp; 

Picking up the pile of clothes from where she had thrown them, Ann carried the bundle into the bathroom and dropped them into the bath tub.&nbsp; She then bent over, placed the plug into the bath and ran cold water onto her outfit until it was completely covered.&nbsp; Using a sponge, she then cleaned the garments before carrying them into the dining room and placing them onto a collapsible dryer.&nbsp; She then walked into the kitchen, poured herself a glass of wine and returned to the bathroom.&nbsp; She turned the shower on and while the water warmed up, Ann got her fluffy towelling robe from her bedroom and the thickest, fluffiest towel that she could find before returning to the bathroom.

Half an hour later she had washed all of the cum from her hair and body.&nbsp; Her skin was now pink where she had scrubbed it.&nbsp; Her eyes were pink and puffy from tears.&nbsp; She was not sure what had happened to her this evening.&nbsp; She felt dirty, unclean, she did not know what else.&nbsp; She wanted to blame Dave, but couldn&#8217;t.&nbsp; She had known the dangers and had thought she knew the rules and what could happen.&nbsp; She had been wrong and things had gone further than she was comfortable with and so, when she could scrub no more, when she had shed all of the tears for her sole that were possible to shed, she got out of the shower.

She spent another hour, curled up on the sofa, white towelling robe securely wrapped about her, clutching a glass of cheep white wine with one hand and hugging Hugo, her large stuffed penguin, which the big, tough, private eye would never admit to owning as she watched late night television until she could not keep her eyes open a moment longer and eventually crawled into bed.

Sleep is the great healer and daylight came like a cleansing light through the cracks in her curtains.&nbsp; Ann stirred and threw an arm over her eyes as the sounds of traffic and daily routine washed over her stunned and battered senses.&nbsp; Last night all of her mothers fears had been true.&nbsp; Ann was the painted whore that is every mothers nightmare.&nbsp; Ann smiled ruefully.&nbsp; If her mother had suspected a tenth of what she had been doing with Dave, Ann would have been grabbed by the ear and dragged kicking and screaming to the nearest priest for the most interesting confession the old boy would have heard in years.&nbsp; And she could forget about ten Hail Marys and one Our Father.&nbsp; The old Dominican would break out the birch especially.&nbsp; Then again, mused Ann.

�Well,� Ann mused, �If sleep is the great healer, then coffee is the great restorative.�

An hour of coffee, strawberry jam on toast and breakfast television later, Ann was filled with a new resolve and understanding of herself.&nbsp; She might have bitten off more than she could possibly chew last night, the bottom line, as far as she was concerned, was that she had enjoyed herself.&nbsp; It might have been perverse, dirty, disgusting, but then it was now a part of who Ann now considered she really was.&nbsp; Nobody, she reflected, rebels like a catholic and she had well and truly rebelled.&nbsp; If she were a slut, then she would be true to herself.&nbsp; She now knew that she was not comfortable with group sex, but felt more in control of her relationship with Dave. 

An old line from her A level English sprang appropriately to mind and she struggled to remember the rest of the poem:

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�The moving finger writes; and having writ,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;moves on; nor all your piety nor wit
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;shall lure it back to cancel half a line,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;nor all your tears wash out a word of it.�

�So be it,� Ann said to herself and, after leafing through the yellow pages and booking an appointment, stepped out to embrace the new day.

Looking in at the office, Ann leafed through her communications.&nbsp; The background check had come back at last.&nbsp; The Birgett family was, indeed, quite interesting, not to mention loaded.&nbsp; Like most wealthy dynasties that Ann had ever heard of, the Birgetts had their share of tragedy and trauma.&nbsp; Ms Birgett, Ann noted with interest, was not Nickys mother, rather her step mother.

�Curiosa and curiosa, � mused Ann. Especially when she read the most recent tragedy to effect the family.&nbsp; Nickys father, Ms Birgetts husband had died recently.&nbsp; The gossip columns noted that the multi billion pound empires fate would not be decided until the new year, when the will would be read.&nbsp; The most probable recipient of the family fortune was the daughter.&nbsp; Although Ms Birgett was mentioned, it was only to note that she was latest of five stepmothers.

�Why,� Ann wondered, had Nicky felt the need to lose herself and why had the stepmother hired Ann to find her?&nbsp; Her mind drifted back to the first morning of the case, just before she had gone to check out the apartment.&nbsp; She had met her police contact but had been vague and non-committal.&nbsp; Could it be that, rather than not being prepared to talk about a case, her former colleague was responding to the powerful influence wielded by someone that rich and therefore powerful?&nbsp; These and other thoughts flicked though her head as she pulled up the URL sites she had asked Mike to look at.

Further investigations of the URL addresses did, indeed, turn up recent visits to an island resort and so, after a quick phone call to Dave, Ann booked a double room at one of the islands major hotels.&nbsp; As far as Ann was now concerned, she could be a little freer with her clients money.

After taking care of business, it was now time to explore her new persona.

That evening, Dave marvelled at the new body jeweller that adorned Anns body.&nbsp; She had pierced her nipples and now had gold six gold rings pierced through her pussy lips, three on each lip.&nbsp; On top of this, Ann had spent three hours, lying on a couch, while a skilled artist, tattooed what he described as �Tribal Art,� onto the small of her back.&nbsp; Although this was not visible, Dave seemed enthusiastic about the tattoo and seemed impressed when Ann pealed back the bandage to moisturise the fresh wound.

Dave had managed to book a couple of weeks off from work.&nbsp; He had not taken much holiday this year and his superior was pleased that he had, at last, decided to take some time for himself.&nbsp; The real reason, that both new, but did not talk about, stemmed back to a case that finished six weeks ago.&nbsp; Dave had been involved in a particularly violent investigation into the triads.&nbsp; An officer had been injured during the arrests and consequent investigations into the details had left many officers traumatised by the nature of the crimes and examination of related evidence.&nbsp; Consequently, his C.O. was more than happy to grant his request at such short notice.&nbsp; Especially since he had been advising Dave to take time off for some weeks now.

To celebrate what Ann called her new persona and the fact that Dave would be accompanying her, Ann leapt on Dave for some good old fashioned, but much needed, Vanilla sex.&nbsp; However, Ann did not get out of their night without being bound.&nbsp; As she lay in bed, post coital glow virtually lighting the darkened bed room,&nbsp; hugging her lover, Dave suggested a little something that he had been planning to do to Ann for some time and that he called �Oven Ready.�

Ann was not sure that she was up to bondage at the moment.&nbsp; But in keeping with her new life, readily accepted.&nbsp; Crossing her hands behind her back and wearing nothing but a knowing smile, she turned around and prepared to be tied.

To her surprise, Dave did not tie her hands behind her back.&nbsp; Instead, opening his bedroom drawer, he pulled out a long length of red bondage rope, softer and more flexible than normal rope, which her folded in two before using it to tie her elbows together.&nbsp; Once her elbows were cinched together, Dave bent her left elbow and, using more bondage rope, tied her wrist to the top of her arm so that the arm was folded like a chicken wing.&nbsp; Ann thought she knew where Dave was going with this but did not say anything to ruin Daves concentration as he repeated the process with the other arm.&nbsp; Next he brought some thick tape from the drawer and, balling her hands into fists, used it to wrap her hands securely into a tight plastic ball.&nbsp; Returning from the drawer yet again, Dave slipped what looked like miniature chefs hats over her hands.&nbsp; 

�Nice touch,� she commented as Dave slipped the second hat over her balled fist.

�I thought so,� he smirked.

Next Dave pulled a head harness with, what she now recognised as a ring gag attached, from the drawer and fastened it tightly around her head.&nbsp; The harness had a steel ring in the top of it.&nbsp; Dave pulled her hair into a ponytail, which he threaded through the ring as he was securing the harness.&nbsp; Once&nbsp; secured he then wrapped, what looked like, leather string around her pony tail, in a criss cross pattern so that the hair was tightly wrapped behind her.

Laying Ann face down on the bed, Dave then tied more of the red chord around her knees so that an end of rope trailed from each knee, while a single length spanned between her legs, like an ineffectual hobble.&nbsp; Ann was tempted to ask about this, but realised how little she would be able to convey through a ring gag and so remained silent.&nbsp; 

Dave then bent her legs at the knees, so that her feet were touching her buttocks, which is where he tied them, wrapping roper around each ankle separately, before tying them to the top of her thigh.&nbsp; Dave then fitted two more chefs hats, one on each foot which would, if not for the gag, have elicited another comment, or at least a smile.&nbsp; Ann was then rolled over so that Ann could kneel on the bed.&nbsp; However, rather than binding her in that position, Dave arranged her legs so that the connecting knee rope was pulled taught, with her legs apart.&nbsp; Ann was then forced forward so that she buried her face into the bed.&nbsp; The two knee ropes where then pulled behind Anns back and tied tightly together so that Anns knees, which were at her side, where pulled painfully backwards.&nbsp; At this, Ann did protest.

�Anggh.&nbsp; At urtts.&nbsp; Ot oe ight,� Ann protested through her gag, spitting drool onto the bed.

�Sorry about that, but it needs to be a little tight.&nbsp; See how you get on with it and if you still think its too tight in about five or ten minutes, I will loosen it a bit,� Dave offered as he pulled the ropes tightly together and tied them behind her back.

Dave then brought a metal ring from the drawer, along with another length of leather.&nbsp; Anns hair had already been secured, so it was easy to pass three or four inches of her hair through this new rope, which he then folded back on itself before wrapping the leather chord around it and securing the ring to the end of her pony tail.

Dave then brought another length of rope to the bed, which he treaded between her shoulders, under her bound elbows, towards her but.&nbsp; Something cold and metallic was placed on her ass.&nbsp; Ann found this puzzling.&nbsp; But not nearly as confusing as when Dave undid a tube of KY jelly and proceeded to lubricate her anus.&nbsp; 

Ann was not puzzled for long as Dave took the blunt metal hook that was attached to the final piece of rope and eased it into her ass.&nbsp; He then threaded the hook rope though the loop in her hair and pulled.&nbsp; This forced Anns head backwards as her hair was pulled painfully by the rope and the hook put pulled painfully within her.

�Unghh,� Ann protested.

�Nearly done,� Dave beamed as he opened his wardrobe and pulled out a box from the bottom, which he dropped on the floor.&nbsp; 

Dave returned to the wardrobe and pulled several lengths of wood from the bottom.&nbsp; These he screwed into the bottom of the box and were, in fact, legs.&nbsp; Once the box was standing securely next to the bed, Dave opened the top to reveal a strange interior, the most noticeable thing being the plastic sheeting on the bottom of the box and the two holes, one at the front and one at the rear.

Ann was blissfully unaware of this, as her view was restricted to the head board of the bed.&nbsp; The first that she knew of the box was when Dave picked her up and lowered her into it.&nbsp; 

Another strange thing about the box was to do with the strange ring gag that Ann was wearing, for it incorporated a second ring, just outside of her mouth.&nbsp; This slotted into a special cradle in the box, over one of the holes.&nbsp; Dave then tightened some form of ratchet that caused Anns face to be pulled painfully towards the front of the box and the plastic which lined the front panel.&nbsp; Just when she thought that her nose, or lips, would be crushed, her forward motion stopped.

Ann was now secured tightly into the box, her but pressed against the back hole, her face against the front.&nbsp; Each hole being three inches in diameter.&nbsp; Dave then lowered the lid.&nbsp; After a few moments Ann heard the distinct sound of rushing air within her small prison.&nbsp; Dave must have attached a pump, or air line to the box.&nbsp; She was at a loss to know why, until the plastic wrapping began to hug her tightly and eventually lift her off the floor of the box.&nbsp; She then noticed that the plastic on top of her had began to press down.&nbsp; The pressure began to build and, just like the mouth lock, Ann felt that she could not endure any more, the pressure stopped.

Now Ann was tightly trussed, just as Dave had hinted, like an oven ready chicken, trapped in a wooden box, which may represent the cardboard box that a turkey usually arrives from the butchers in, or may perhaps represent the oven.&nbsp; She was securely vacuum sealed, pinned by inflated plastic built into the box.&nbsp; Her mouth was forced over a hole, and so was her pussy.&nbsp; She had no illusions&nbsp; what that was for.&nbsp; She had a hook up her ass, her hair was being pulled.&nbsp; She was, she considered, in for a long night.

Among The Missing 8

Anns earlier synopsis about a long night were to prove correct.&nbsp; She had lost track of the length of time that she had spent in the box.&nbsp; Her arms and legs ached from the cramped position and tight bondage.&nbsp; Her hair hurt.&nbsp; She was hot and sweaty.&nbsp; She had also begun to drift mentally.&nbsp; She was in a black world with no stimulation, no noise, no breeze upon her skin, apart from the air that she drew in through her mouth or that occasionally wafted onto her exposed pussy.&nbsp; Ann was in that place where imagination and reality collide.&nbsp; A place where her fate had been sealed and because she could do nothing about it, had already accepted the reality of her situation.&nbsp; This was, as far as Ann knew, subland.

Ann was bought out of her mental stupor when something touched her pussy.&nbsp; Having been without contact, or stimulation, for so long, or so Ann felt, the sudden probing caused her to start, or at least twitch, within her prison.&nbsp; The thing was soft and wet and it was probing her intimate areas.&nbsp; Not a finger.&nbsp; But perhaps.&nbsp; Which was precisely the moment that she felt the warm breath upon her sensitive lips and she knew that Dave was gently touching, not licking her pussy, but touching her with his tongue.&nbsp; 

All of Anns concentration now centred on a few square inches of flesh as Dave began to probe and lick in earnest.&nbsp; A sharp nip on her erect bud forced her to jump and scream within her prison, but soon this changed to a moan as the tongue continued to probe and titillate until she was soaking wet and she felt the orgasm build within her.&nbsp; All of a sudden she was shaking and struggling with her bonds as a gigantic orgasm rolled over her.&nbsp; Ann returned to reality gasping as stars raced across her vision.&nbsp; But, despite the noise and violence of her climax, the tongue continued its questing torment.&nbsp; Again and again her reality was torn asunder as violent orgasm compacted on top of violent orgasm until all sense of place and reality disappeared.&nbsp; Which was then that Dave replaced his probing tongue with his rigid cock.

The time for fore play and petting had passed and Ann, despite her aroused condition, grunted as Dave, without ceremony thrust his cock deep into her, forcing another stiff cry from her lips.&nbsp; Before she could recover from this intrusion Dave began to pump.&nbsp; Forwards and backwards forwards and backwards, until she could take no more and another orgasm rocked her tiny universe.&nbsp; Dave, feeling the orgasm, did not allow his pace to slacken at all and, after a few moments, actually increased his speed until Ann was caught in the throws of one gigantic, continuous orgasm that could only find release in the long, continuous, primal scream that escaped from her mouth as a single, long, note.

Ann was so wrapped up in her orgasm that she barely noticed Dave cum, or start to pull out.&nbsp; It was only the final pop, as Daves cock was pulled clear of her Pussy that Ann dreamily realised that Dave had finished.&nbsp; She did not have long to mourn however, as Dave walked around to the front of the box and thrust his cock into Anns mouth.&nbsp; Ann did not need a degree in biology to know what Dave wanted and so, once she had recovered from the intrusion, set about cleaning and sucking, using her tongue to make sure she did a really proper job.&nbsp; Eventually, Dave was clean and had started to deflate.&nbsp; Ann felt his cock withdraw with a feeling of great reluctance as she was left alone, with her memories, cum in her sopping wet pussy and down her throat.&nbsp; Sub land beckoned and Ann submitted willingly, her earlier aches forgotten.

After a while Ann&#8217;s mental wanderings were again brought back to the present.&nbsp; This time, however, it was not a probing tongue that dragged her back to reality, but an aching bladder.&nbsp; Ann squirmed within her prison, trying to make herself more comfortable.&nbsp; After all, she would not be in here for much longer.&nbsp; But after a few minutes the building pressure signalled that she would need help and so she called for Dave.

�Ave.&nbsp; Ave.&nbsp; I ant oo oos ee athoom.�

After waiting for several moments, she tried again.&nbsp; This time she was a little more urgent.&nbsp; But still no response from Dave.&nbsp; Finally she screamed and shuffled about her prison, which only seemed to make her condition worse.&nbsp; Dave did not come.&nbsp; Perhaps he had gone out, or was deeply asleep.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever the reason, Ann realised that her aching bladder would not wait and that relief was not coming.&nbsp; After debating with herself and calling for help one last time, although this does not describe the desperate sob which escaped her lips, Ann did something that she had not done since nursery school.&nbsp; 

Rather than having to lie in a wet puddle, Ann found that she was still dry.

�Oh well, it&#8217;s Daves carpet and his problem.&nbsp; He should not have left me here for so long,� the now greatly relieved and surprisingly blas� Ann reflected.

Unbeknown to her, Dave had mounted a small splash plate and a funnel over the rear of the box, which he simply removed when he required access.&nbsp; This ensured that all such waste was directed down towards a waiting bucket.&nbsp; Ann however, did not know this as she once again drifted off away from the present reality.

Ann was not sure how long she remained imprisoned.&nbsp; Time and space became meaningless.&nbsp; Even her own limbs lost their feeling.&nbsp; She was a hot, sweaty body.&nbsp; Merged with the box, she had become a fuck toy for her master.&nbsp; Dave visited her several times during her imprisonment.&nbsp; On the second occasion he used a finger to excite her before entering her.&nbsp; But by the third time all foreplay was dispensed with and the first that Ann knew of Daves presence was when she felt something cold and wet smeared over her pussy before Dave entered her in one strong, single, thrust.&nbsp; Once he had used her he withdrew and again shoved his cock into her second hole for cleaning.&nbsp; Ann recognised the taste of KY jelly mingled with her juices and Daves cum.&nbsp; 

Several more times she felt Dave lubricate her, before forcing his member into her.&nbsp; As well as losing all sense of time and space, she had also lost her identity.&nbsp; She had become Fuckbox.&nbsp; Little more than a receptacle for her masters lust.&nbsp; 

Ann drifted lost in her prison which denied all sight, sound and feeling, apart from that which her master chose to give her until she herd a sound that she did not recognise.&nbsp; It filled her ears with a hissing noise and she felt movement as the back holding her began to lessen its pressure on her and she was lying on the bottom of the box.&nbsp; Shooting pain in her eyes announced that the box had been opened and that she was once again exposed to the light.&nbsp; Hands fiddled and pulled and at last she felt herself lifted from the box and laid on the bed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ann stared mutely at the head board and fingers worked at her bonds.&nbsp; At las she was free, lying naked on her back and staring at the ceiling as Dave vigorously rubbed her limbs.

Sharp pain erupted through her long forgotten limbs as blood rushed back into hands, feet and fingers and Ann screamed as reality returned to her world and she sobbed uncontrollably as she fiercely hugged her former gaoler and tormentor.

 It took another hour, two coffees and a bacon sandwich before Ann felt relatively human again.&nbsp; She had, she discovered, been in the box for two days.&nbsp; However, apart from using her, Dave had been busy.&nbsp; He had managed to research the island and had not only found a place to stay, but had also managed to book rooms on line.&nbsp; He had also managed to download some of the local brochures.&nbsp; Until she had to travel to the island, she had little to do and so, after returning to her apartment, she updated her client via e-mail, forwarding a copy back to the office.&nbsp; Her in box had the usual messages from the office and of course her mother.&nbsp; 

It was nearly Christmas.&nbsp; Had she got all of her presents?&nbsp; Was she coming over for Christmas dinner?&nbsp; Would she be bringing a friend.&nbsp; After all, they were not getting any younger and it would be nice to be able to share the festivities with grandchildren.&nbsp; Oh and you never call.&nbsp; Ann cursed.&nbsp; Most self respecting women of her mothers age shied away from the internet and e-mail.&nbsp; They could be kept at arms length by the wonders of answer machines.&nbsp; Unfortunately Anns&#8217; mother had embraced both technologies.&nbsp; Cursing again, Ann sent a quick reply before setting off.&nbsp; There were still a few presents to get and she did not have a great deal of time for shopping.&nbsp; Not if she was to get everything wrapped and posted before she left for the island.

Shopping, two weeks before the festive season, in a busy town centre is usually best contemplated while holding a spiked base ball bat and wearing body armour.&nbsp; Ann had neither.&nbsp; But she did have two things going for her.&nbsp; Firstly, it was a week day.&nbsp; Secondly, she was a veteran of several January sales.&nbsp; Even so, several hours later, Ann staggered through her front door, laden with presents and looking as though she had just spent the day running a marathon, while boxing Tyson.

Most athletes will tell you that, when working for long periods of time, it is important to keep the fluids up.&nbsp; They might also mutter something about replacing electrolytes, so that your muscles do not cramp and eating things like high energy bars to keep you going.

Anybody who has every fought their way through a January sale, or attempted to get any presents, remotely suitable, two weeks before Christmas, will also have a dietary plan.&nbsp; Anns involved plenty of coffee, with the occasional munch on something deep fried and covered in chocolate. 

After collapsing onto her sofa and depositing the shopping on the floor, Ann set about fixing tea and wrapping presents.&nbsp; Two hours later, Ann was refuelled on a particularly tasteless microwave meal.&nbsp; Surrounded by discarded wrapping paper tubes, spare address labels and wrapped presents.&nbsp; By way of celebration she was now holding a tall mug of drinking chocolate, topped off with marsh mallows, whipped cream and a crushed Flake bar.

The following morning she packed her suit cases, took her parcels to the Post office and set off to pick up Dave and head for the Island.

Ann stood on the ferry and took in the stark, grey, panorama from the deck rail, as the ship pulled headed towards the small jetty.&nbsp; A little research, before leaving, had revealed that there were two ferries a day.&nbsp; This, Ann believed, would be to enable the islanders to commute to school, or work.&nbsp; She had chosen the morning service, as this would afford her a look at the island upon arriving.&nbsp; She wished now that she had opted for a lie in bed.

Although relatively warm, whitecaps were beginning to form on the tops of the waves, indicating a force four, perhaps five wind, in the captains estimate.&nbsp; Thick grey seemed to cling to the clouds and the waves, as the cold wind seemed to suck the warmth from under the thick coat that Ann clutched about her like a sacred talisman.&nbsp; 

When the ferry had set off, the sun was just coming over the horizon, casting bands of orange, in a cool glow that hinted the promise of later warmth.&nbsp; Now she understood the lie behind that illusion.&nbsp; The landscape of the island was plain and drab.&nbsp; For nearly twenty minutes the ferry had circled the island, heading for seaward.&nbsp; Although Ann had seen a harbour, with many small boats, the deeper anchorage, which could be used by the ferry, lay on the West of the island.

Her first sight of the port was as uninspiring as the journey.&nbsp; Brightly coloured houses attempting to drive back the gloom of the season and attempt to banish the harshness from the whether, but to no avail.&nbsp; No amount of paint, even on such sturdy stone cottages, could disguise the fact that this is the armpit of nowhere.&nbsp; An ideal place then, if you intended to set up a some sort of alternate lifestyle commune.

This feeling of oppression, although remaining, like the aftertaste of a bad wine, began to disappear very quickly, once she had arrived.&nbsp; The houses were still as brightly painted as ever and many of the locals wore heavy coats and fishing boots.&nbsp; But occasionally, the true nature of the island was revealed.&nbsp; Ann occasional passer by, clad in rubber, with impossibly high heals, would stride past, like a garish peacock of shiny smooth perfection.&nbsp; A girl, nearly naked, but for her leather adornments, emerged from one of the shops, lead by her master, as he tugged upon the dog leash attached to a thick, leather, collar around her neck.&nbsp; At one point she stumbled and it was then, as she struggled to maintain her balance that Ann realised that her arms were securely tied behind her back.&nbsp; At last, they arrived at the hotel and booked in.

The first two days, despite being very interesting, (Dave lead her by a leash, while she was dressed in tight rubber, shackles, high heels and an inflatable gag, in a repeat of the methods that they had used in the club.) especially after Ann and Dave had explored their hotel room, complete with en suite dungeon, produced no results.&nbsp; Ann had decided that they had two chances.&nbsp; Once would be to explore the other village, on the Eastern side of the island.&nbsp; The other would be to wait until the festival that everybody had been talking about in two days time.
In the mean time, Ann had more exploring to do.&nbsp; For the last two days, she had tried out all that the dungeon had to offer, starting with something called a vacuum bed, which sucked the air out from between the plastic sheets and the bed, pining her between them, only able to breath through a vacuum cleaners flexi hose forced between her teeth.&nbsp; All the while that she had been pinned, like a naked bug on display, a dildo had buzzed deep within her pussy, while Dave chewed on her nipples, beat her with a paddle or removed the air hose and forced her to swallow his member, coming into her mouth.&nbsp; The most humiliating thing though was that, once she had cleaned his member, Dave had pissed down her throat.&nbsp; She tried to spit it out, to gag, she even thought about biting it, but Dave kept pressed firmly against her, as she tried not to throw up, with the vile taste within her mouth.&nbsp; Finally, running out of air, she realised that she had not option.&nbsp; She had struggled vainly against her plastic prison, had tried to scream through her fleshy prison, but at last she realised there was only one option open to her and she swallowed Dave&#8217;s piss.&nbsp; Once she had taken all that was forced upon her, Dave replace the breathing tube.&nbsp; Later, after another futile battle, her own urine seeped into the bed, spreading out as the vacuum pump sucked avidly, to cover her like a film of sweat, lying in her own filth until morning, when she was released.

The next night, she spent suspended in a wire cage, straight from the pages of a medieval torture chamber.&nbsp; It was, she believed, called a gibbet, of something like.&nbsp; A wire cage in the shape of a body, including head and legs.&nbsp; The cage opened in to two halves.&nbsp; Ann, dressed in a leather harness and a ball gag, stepped inside.&nbsp; Even before being closes, Ann began to revel in the confines of her prison.&nbsp; Dave slid the cage closed and padlocked it.&nbsp; Then, using a winch to haul a chin attached to the top of the gibbet, Dave pulled her prison up into the air until it touched the ring in the oak ceiling beam, so that her prison hung some three feet above the floor.&nbsp; Again, Dave subject her t all manner of deliciously humiliating experiences.

They would explore the other village tomorrow, but for tonight, Ann wished to try out one last contraption.&nbsp; It stood as a three-foot cage like structure, with a bench in the middle, about two feet high.&nbsp; Ann, wearing a ring gag, white rubber corset, white stockings and white ballet boots, crawled into the cage so that she was laying on the bench.&nbsp; She lowered her breasts into the two holes cut into the bench.&nbsp; The holes were quite tight, and Dave had to pull her breasts through the holes, before attaching a pair of nipple clamps.&nbsp; These clamps were connected, by wire, to the base of the cage.&nbsp; Dave adjusted the wires so that Ann&#8217;s nipples were pulled painfully taught.&nbsp; Next her manacled her ankles and wrists to the sides of the frame.&nbsp; Finally, a metal ring was placed around her head, to keep it facing forward, while another was passed over her waist, securing her to the bench.&nbsp; Dave lowered a pole contraption behind her.&nbsp; He aligned the dildo, attached to one end, directly with her pussy lips, before securing the pole.&nbsp; Another pole was attached to this, so that it angled about two inches higher.&nbsp; A second dildo attached to this pole and aligned this with her anus ring.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dave lubricated both dildos, as well as her orifices.&nbsp; Finally, another, longer pole, already affixed to the underside of the bench was, after rotating an arm into position, was clamped to the poles already in place.&nbsp; The other end of this pole had a bend&nbsp; which curved the pole upwards towards the mouth.&nbsp; A Final dildo, after a little adjustment, was positioned in front of the ring gag.&nbsp; Dave pushed this final dildo all the way into Ann&#8217;s mouth, almost forcing her to gag, before bolting it into place.&nbsp; Ann was now trapped.&nbsp; She could not move at all, but she knew what was to come.&nbsp; Dave had explained it to her in great detail, as he had also explained that the dildo in her mouth was only one of several attachments to go with this device.&nbsp; He could also place a seat in front of her head and force her to pleasure another person, who could also be restrained, if he so chose.

Finally, all of the bolting and positioning complete, Dave stood so that Ann could see him holding the remote.&nbsp; Giving her a wry grin, Dave pushed a button and the sound of a generator started behind her.&nbsp; After what seemed like an eternity, Dave pushed another button and, with a hiss of air, the pneumatics rammed the dildos violently into her ass and pussy, while the same stroke caused the mouth cock to pull back.&nbsp; Almost as quickly as it had started, another hiss emptied the piston, causing it to pull back, so that the dildos in her rear and pussy pulled out, while the one in her mouth forced its way to the back of her throat, almost causing her to gag.&nbsp; Once this had returned to its starting position, it again leapt forward to plunge into her pussy and now red anus.

The first stroke had been a shock, forcing a violent grunt from her.&nbsp; Ann watched as the dildo left her mouth, before lurching quickly towards her.&nbsp; Her scream of surprise being cut short by the violent intruders return to her mouth.

After she had gotten used to the rhythm, perhaps several minutes later and her own juices were now lubricating the dildos, Dave bent down towards her face.

�That&#8217;s level 1.&nbsp; What do your think,� he asked as he cocked his head?&nbsp; �Why don&#8217;t we try level 3?&nbsp; It&#8217;s slightly faster and I think I will increase the length of the stroke.�

Ann tried to protest, she was already a little sore, but Dave simply stood up and walked to the back of the cage.&nbsp; She could not turn her head, or protest too strongly, as the machine was still pumping into her, but she knew when he had made the adjustments.&nbsp; The stroke was definitely longer, as the dildo was forced deeper into her, stretching her inside with force and insistence.&nbsp; Also, the speed of each stroke was now quicker, so that she had to adjust to the new harsher regime.

Ann did not know how long she was strapped into the cage.&nbsp; She lost count of orgasms and time blurred and lost its meaning, as she was rammed unmercifully by the machine, her grunts and moans lost amidst the steam engine noises of the infernal contraption in which she was imprisoned.&nbsp; Finally, she passed out, waking to find herself sprawled out in bed, her hands and feet chained to the bedposts and Dave asleep, sprawled across her.&nbsp; She was sore, her muscles ached and she would have trouble walking tomorrow, but God it was worth it.

Ann knew that she was awake because the sun was shining through her closed eye lids, she could hear the sound of Dave busying himself in the kitchen, making fresh coffee by the smell tickling her senses with a strong insistence that would not be denied and, oh yes, she ached all over.&nbsp; Not just the usual post sex ache that signifies a really good rogering from a reasonably well-endowed man, but the sort of ache that says that she might have difficulty walking for the next year.&nbsp; Not only did her pussy and anus ache from the excesses of her automated bedroom buddy, but her nipples also ached from where the nipple clamps, wired to the frame, had tugged at her sore breasts as the long strokes had violently shoved her forward and backward with the care and tenderness of a steam train.&nbsp; Her throat was sore from the assault inflicted on it by the dildo forced repeatedly into her mouth, not to mention all of the screaming that she did between the strokes.&nbsp; She knew that the first words she uttered this morning would be croaked, unless she had a sweet drink first.&nbsp; However, for all of her aches, sore places and abuses, she would mount the same bench again now, if she thought that she would not need to be air lifted to the mainland hospital within five minutes.&nbsp; That image, along with all of the embarrassing questions she knew that she would have to answer brought a smile to her face.

�Morning sleepy.&nbsp; How are you feeling?�

�Arghnn,� Ann groaned as she opened her eyes and immediately regretted doing so.

�He he he,� Dave chuckled.&nbsp; �Overdid it a bit did we?&nbsp; You need get up and move those sore limbs before you seize up.�

Ann greeted this overly cheerfully delivered observation with as much contempt that she could convey with a suitably scornfully delivered groan.&nbsp; Never the less, half an&nbsp; hour&nbsp; later, full of coffee and toast, she was massaging the aches out of the muscles she had so recently abused, under the massaging stream of hot water from a good quality power shower.

Dave, true to form, was already rummaging through bags and cupboards.

�How are we going to get to the other village?&nbsp; We had to leave the car on the mainland,�&nbsp; Ann asked as Dave continued to search through their bags.

�Oh, I have hired us, well I was hoping to surprise you.�

�O.K.&nbsp; I love surprises,� Ann said as she fumbled on the bedside table for the nipple rings that she had had to remove the night before.&nbsp; 

For some reason, her favourite toy didn&#8217;t come equipped for pierced nipples.&nbsp; Shame.&nbsp; Ann replaced her jewellery where it belonged.&nbsp; Giving it a playful flick.&nbsp; Turning around she found Dave holding a blindfold.

�Ready for that surprise,� he grinned at her.

�Hmm, we&#8217;ll see,� Ann purred as Dave placed the blindfold over her eyes and checked to make sure that she was truly blind.&nbsp; 

The mask was a simple, basic, sleep mask that you could buy from respectable magazines designed for the older generation.&nbsp; It even had frills around the edges.&nbsp; No leather, rubber or PVC in sight.&nbsp; Even so, it was very effective and Ann was effectively blinded.&nbsp; Shame, she would have preferred more straps and buckles.&nbsp; Oh well.

Next she felt Dave fitting a posture collar around her neck.&nbsp; Actually, by the way that it was fastened at the front and by the laces that Dave was now tugging on, Ann guessed that it was more of a posture corset.&nbsp; Once he had finished, Ann could not lower her head and had no trouble looking from left to right.

Next Dave fitted a strappy, not quite corset, more like a body harness, to her.&nbsp; She could feel cold metal bits from the leather touching her arms as they hung at her sides.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, once he had finished, she found that her body was tightly bound in leather straps and, although her breasts were encircled by leather, they were still lewdly exposed, hanging freely, although tightly encircled around their base.

�How far do you recon it is to the other side of the island?�&nbsp; Ann enquired as Dave tightened the single strap that cut through her sex.

Strangely, as&nbsp; Dave tightened the strap, she noted the cold chill of metal around her anus.&nbsp; Dave adjusted this and, she guessed, this was some sort of metal ring.&nbsp; Ann puzzled over this for a few moments, before Dave answered her question.

�Probably about ten miles or so.&nbsp; It will still take us a few hours to get there though,� Dave said as he attached a leather strap to the top of each elbow.

Next, Dave attached a strange, balled glove to each hand, which forced her to close her hands into a fist as Dave laced them tightly around her hands.&nbsp; A leather strap on the side of the glove was pulled tightly around the wrist, covering the laces.&nbsp; Dave bent her arms at the elbows, so that the back of her hands were nearly touching her shoulders, enabling him to take the rest of the glove strap, wrap it under her arm pit, buckling the free end to the other side of the glove, effectively binding her arm like a chicken wing.

While Dave repeated the process on her other arm, Ann flexed her arm experimentally and, although she could move the shoulder freely, she could not unbend her arm.&nbsp; There was also something strange about the glove, although she could not discern what.&nbsp; 

Any movement that Ann thought she had in her arms was soon removed as Dave used padlocks to attach the elbow straps on each arm to leather D rings on the harness, toward the back of the garment.&nbsp; This forced her to pull her shoulders back, making her breasts jut out, proudly displaying her assets to the onlookers who, Ann now felt, would soon be treated to a rather public display of Ann&#8217;s assets.

�Ow, not so tight,� Ann complained as Dave pulled her left elbow uncomfortably backwards, before locking it in place.

�Sorry, but I this stuff is has to lock where the buckles are,� Dave said apologetically.

Next, Dave guided her gently down, so that she was sitting on the edge of the bed, before helping her into a pair of ankle length boots.&nbsp; These, naturally, had an impossibly high heal and laced very tightly around her feet.&nbsp; As Dave again helped her to stand, Ann found that she needed his support as she nearly fell back onto the bed.&nbsp; Unlike a normal heal, this boot did not offer as much support at the heel and Ann had to place her weight slightly more forward than she was used to.&nbsp; The sound was also louder, as she walked, than she would have expected.&nbsp; 

She started as she felt Dave&#8217;s finger exploring her anus, smearing something over and into it.&nbsp; It was no surprise then that, a few moments later; Ann felt the now familiar intrusion of a butt plug.

�Nearly time for your surprise.&nbsp; Come on,� Dave encouraged, as he grabbed her arm and lead her to the door.

Ann leant heavily on Dave as they descended the stairs.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not easy trying to tackle a stair case, wearing heels, a blindfold, while struggling with a large but plug between your cheeks and your arms tied to your body.&nbsp; It is one favour that she would have to repay.

Ann felt cold air on her body as the door opened and she was lead out onto the street.&nbsp; There was something familiar about the noise that her heels made on the pavement, but for the moment she could not place it as she was lead along the high street to their destination.&nbsp; 

�Clack, clack, clack,� her heals rhythmically sounded as they struck on the hard concrete.

Still puzzling over the noise she was still confused as the street noises quietened down and an herd the sound of her feet echoed as they entered a large building.&nbsp; Surprisingly though, she could still make out the street noises, so it was not totally enclosed.

�Hi, I called earlier about,�&nbsp; Dave started, but was interrupted.

�Aye, tis over there.&nbsp; If you need any help, jus showt.&nbsp; Int mean time, I&#8217;ll be needin a dposit.�

�O.K.&nbsp; Stay here, I&#8217;ll just go and sort out the money side.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll be back in a mo.�
Daves comforting arm vanished from her side.&nbsp; She listened as his footsteps receded and she heard a door open.&nbsp; She could just about make out the muffled sound of voices, but could not make out any words.&nbsp; She shivered as a cold December breeze found her, tickling her already erect nipples and causing goose bumps to sprout across her body.&nbsp; She stood for an eternity, alone and seemingly abandoned, like a child at a fair ground who had lost it&#8217;s parents.&nbsp; She felt vulnerable, exposed and at the mercy of any passer by who cared to run his hands over her body, wrapping his hand over her mouth and lifting her up, as his already wrapped and delivered prize struggled in vain against her bonds.

�Hi.&nbsp; All done.&nbsp; You are going to love this,� Dave ranted as Ann was startled out of her day dream.

Dave lead her by the arm again, perhaps twenty, or thirty feet further into the building.&nbsp; Grabbing her shoulders, he turned her around and guided her backwards, fumbled with something at first her left hip and then the right.

�O.K. Are you ready?�

�Oh yes,�&nbsp; Ann replied ruefully, which although it was the truth, was also polluted by a growing suspicion.

Like a conjurer producing a rabbit from a hat, Dave removed the blindfold with a loud �Tada.�

Ann blinked, but it did not take her long to adjust to the dim interior of the barn.&nbsp; No, not a barn, a stable yard.&nbsp; Ann&#8217;s suspicion had formed into a certainty as she turned her head and bent her body as best she could to see behind her.&nbsp; She was in no way shocked to discover that she was standing, or rather attached to, the poles of a small, two wheeled cart, or that the but plug had a long, horse hair tail protruding from it.&nbsp; Turning her attention back to the front she could now see what was wrong with the gloves she wore.&nbsp; They were hooves, complete with metal shoes and, bending down, she was she found that her feet were shod in the same fashion.&nbsp; Now she knew where she had heard that sound.&nbsp; It was not the �Clack, Clack� sound of heals, but the �Clip, Clop� sound of horses hooves.

Ann was about to protest.&nbsp; She had had a hard night last night and was not sure she was up a ten mile hike, in the dead of winter, pulling him and a cart.&nbsp; But the please with himself, school boy look and, more than that, the need in his eyes convinced her to hold her objections, at least for the minute.&nbsp; 

She was about to quantify her role, opening her mouth to state that she might like to try a mile, or two, when Dave pulled a final item from behind his back.&nbsp; She should have expected it, she supposed.&nbsp; She stood, watching the thing, mouth open, in shock.&nbsp; No, this was too much.

�Dave I Gnng.&nbsp; Ave, ung um ot ure arat is.&nbsp; Ung, oow,� Ann tried as Dave fitted the steel bridle between her lips.

She had seen enough pony play pictures by now, or so she thought, to realise that this was not the usual rubber, or wooden bar that most �Ponygirls� wear.&nbsp; This looked like an articulated metal bridal, complete with metal loops at either side, that you would really find on a horse, or small pony.&nbsp; Although, as she flexed her mouth experimentally, while Dave tightened the many straps of the head harness, which came complete with blinkers. It actually felt quite comfortable. 

Next, Ann felt a tug and twist as Dave removed her nipple rings, replacing them, so she felt, with larger, thicker rings, which he attached to the reigns hanging down from her bridle.&nbsp; Undoing the strap that ran through her sex, Dave repeated the process, adjusting the length of the reigns so that they hung below her pussy, as Dave fed them between her legs and back to the cart, where he picked up another set of reigns, which he attached to either side of the bit.&nbsp; 

�This should ensure that you enjoy the journey,� Dave commented as Ann heard a buzzing sound followed by the feeling of something, no two something&#8217;s that were small and round and vibrating, being pushed into her pussy before Dave roughly pulled the strap back between her pussy lips, sealing the love eggs deep within her.

This was really too much.&nbsp; Every step that she took would be excruciating, tantalising, orgasmic torture.&nbsp; Ann felt the poles move as Dave sat in the cart.&nbsp; Dave flipped the reigns, pulling painfully on her nipples and pussy.

�Giddy up,� Dave encouraged as he flicked the reigns again, but Ann did not move.

Dave pondered this for a second.&nbsp; 

�Don&#8217;t want your morning exercise huh Dobbin?�

Ann felt the reigns tugged again, this time with more painful force.&nbsp; But now it was accompanied by another sound as Dave hollered �Giddy up Dobbin.�

�Crack.�&nbsp; Sharp pain erupted in a thin line across her buttock.&nbsp; 

Ann jumped forward.&nbsp; Just to make sure she was properly motive Dave wielded the whip again. 

�Crack.�&nbsp; Another blossom of pain erupted across her ass, as she shot forward.&nbsp; Ann did not need telling again.&nbsp; If Dave really wanted to do this, who was she to argue.

�That&#8217;s it.&nbsp; Now try and pick your feet up.&nbsp; Trot for me girl.�

Ann picked her feet up in a jaunty step as she tried to please her master, reminded of his presence by the painful tugs in her nipples and pussy as Dave flicked the reigns, or used them to turn her head, guiding her progress with a firm hand.

Unfortunately, the love eggs were all too effective and she nearly stumbled as the first orgasm rocked her body.

The journey seemed to last an eternity.&nbsp; Occasionally Dave would stop and give her a drink, which tasted more like a sports drink, from a pull top sports bottle, squirting the liquid to the back of her throat.

Despite these rest stops, Ann soon lost all sense of time as she got into the rhythm of the trot, shuddering and attempting to keep going through orgasm after orgasm, since Dave whipped her severely for any mistakes as she high stepped her way across the dirt road that connected the two villages.

Ann was not sure where she was.&nbsp; She was on her knees.&nbsp; Her head was underwater.&nbsp; Pulling herself back she saw that she was in front of a water trough.&nbsp; Looking around she saw that they had arrived.&nbsp; She did not remember arriving.&nbsp; The last hour had been one continuous orgasm.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t sure that it had been an hour.&nbsp; It could have been longer.&nbsp; She could hear voices.&nbsp; Leaning forward she drank some more water from the trough, although she did this gingerly.&nbsp; Although the batteries had started to run down, the love eggs were still remarkably effective when she moved.

Sitting back, she could hear the conversation and recognised Daves voice, along with another, a womans voice.

�She is lovely Dave. Wherever did you find her?�

�She found me. She came to the flat, looking for you.�

Ann felt a hand on her chin, which turned her head to the left.

�Ooh, she is divine,� the impossibly tall, rubber clad girl purred&nbsp; as she bent down and licked the sweat off of Ann&#8217;s bosom.

�Well.&nbsp; Now you have found me,� the impossibly tall woman stated, as Ann at last looked into the face of the woman she had gone to such lengths to find, Nicky Birgett.

Ann knelt on the freezing ground shivering, her head covered in water that she had just gulped down greedily from the horse trough just moments before.&nbsp; While she had been moving she had been able to keep herself warm, but now that she had stopped, her sweat drenched body could feel the full effect of the bitter December chill.&nbsp; She was also exhausted.&nbsp; Although not unfit, pulling a cart and passenger for ten miles over a rough track, complete with a passenger for several hours was not her bodies idea of gentle exercise.&nbsp; Although Dave had given her sports drink and regular stops, it was not enough to replace the salts and fluids that she had lost.&nbsp; She had hit what athletes call �The Wall� about an hour ago.&nbsp; She was not sure how she had made it this far, but she had her legs had been ravaged by cramps and spasms for the last mile.&nbsp; 

Ann had imagined what she would say when she eventually found her quarry, Nicky Birgett, but all that she could do now was pant as the rubber clad Amazon towered above her, inspecting her with a critical eye.&nbsp; She tried to form a greeting, but what came out was unintelligible.&nbsp; She was still wearing the bit.&nbsp; Nicky started to move, swaying, spinning and fading.&nbsp; Suddenly, Ann was lying on the ground pressed against her face and then all was dark.

Ann woke up feeling drained.&nbsp; She was still wearing the pony gear, but the head harness felt different.&nbsp; It was softer and, although there was something in her mouth, pressing her tong down, it was not a part of the headgear.&nbsp; It felt like a dental thing, all wire and plastic.&nbsp; She did not care, it was more comfortable than what she had been wearing.&nbsp; Her hands were still tied behind her back, she was still wearing the boots and harness and she seemed to be wearing some sort of quilt.&nbsp; It was also pitch black.&nbsp; She was not lying in a bed. That she was sure of.&nbsp; Her mattress felt wrong, prickly, almost like, but she could not finish the thought.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t know or care.&nbsp; Shifting her position until she was comfortable, she allowed her exhaustion to wash over her as sleep claimed her.

Bright light woke her.&nbsp; Sunlight flooded into her room and Ann groaned.&nbsp; She was lying on her front&nbsp; and a thousand needles pricked body, legs and especially her face which were not covered by the quilt.&nbsp; Shifting her weight and tilting her head slightly, Ann opened her eyes.&nbsp; Not needles, but straw.&nbsp; She was lying on a bed of straw.&nbsp; After a moment, her eyes were acclimatised enough to turn and look at the light source.&nbsp; It was bright and for a moment, Ann could not make out what she was seeing.&nbsp; However, within moments she was able to state that she was looking at a stable door, with the top half open.&nbsp; Framed in the upper section, Nicky Birgett leaned nonchalantly.&nbsp; Ann was in a horse stall.&nbsp; It was plain, made from white washed breezeblocks.&nbsp; She was however, warmer than she expected.&nbsp; Sitting up, she took in her surroundings.&nbsp; She was wearing some form of padded poncho, like a horse blanket.&nbsp; She also noted that, in addition to some sort of wall mounted feeding trough, a large radiator was bolted to one wall.

�Good morning little one.&nbsp; How are you feeling?� Nicky enquired from the doorway.

�Ii ood ee et er� Ann replied, but the mouthpiece made speech impossible.

�Don&#8217;t try to talk just yet.&nbsp; I bought you some clothes. I thought you could join me for breakfast.�

Ann did not need to be asked twice.&nbsp; As kinky as her outfit was, the novelty factor had well and truly worn off and she found herself nodding vigorously as Nicky opened the lower half of the stable door and stepped in carrying a bundle.

Once changed, Nicky had led her across the street to a large stone house.&nbsp; Although a period building, this was no simple fishing cottage.&nbsp; Perhaps it was an official building, like the harbour masters.&nbsp; She was not sure, but definitely Georgian.&nbsp; Ann did not care.&nbsp; For the first time in ages, she was not wearing rubber, but normal clothes.&nbsp; It felt weird, different, almost alien.&nbsp; Ann was not sure about her strange reaction, but at least these clothes, although plain, almost conservative, were warm.

Once inside, her hostess informed her that she had taken the liberty of running her a bath.&nbsp; Ann did not need asking twice.&nbsp; Within minutes she was naked and climbing into the largest, warmest, bubbliest bath she had ever known.&nbsp; She was not sure how long she lay, luxuriating, in this liquid heaven, but eventually she noticed that she was starting to turn into a wrinkled prune and, admitting defeat, climbed out of the bath.&nbsp; On the same pile that towel had been stowed she found a white, fluffy, flannel dressing gown.&nbsp; Once dried, she wrapped herself in the robe, wrapped a towel around her head, put on a pair of fluffy slippers and made her way downstairs, where her host had prepared fresh coffee and a big bowl of porridge.&nbsp; Not the most exotic breakfast, but given the conditions outside, definitely the most sensible.

Over breakfast Ann explained why she was looking for Nicky.

�I would rather not be found by my stepmother at this time,� Nicky informed Ann.

�But why?&nbsp; She seems genuinely concerned.�

�Family business.&nbsp; I won&#8217;t bore you with the details.&nbsp; Lets just say that I don&#8217;t want to be found at the moment.�

�That&#8217;s fair enough,� Ann conceded.&nbsp; �Normally in this sort of event, I would simply say that I had found the person and would pass on any messages or encourage the missing party to make contact, but would not divulge the location if the person did not want me to.�

Nicky seemed to relax at this and the conversation moved onto other matters.&nbsp; Ann related the efforts that she had gone to while her hostess plied her with steaming hot coffee.&nbsp; Ann described most of her adventures, leaving out most of the embarrassing bits, as well as her growing relationship with Dave.

�Speaking of Dave, where is he?�&nbsp; Ann enquired.

�Oh he&#8217;s around. I have asked him if you and he wouldn&#8217;t be more comfortable on this side of the island.&nbsp; Dave seemed to agree and he is going to get your belongings moved here.&nbsp; Now, we have a busy day ahead of us.&nbsp; Why don&#8217;t you get changed and meet me back here in 20 minutes.�

Nicky led Ann upstairs to one of the guestrooms.&nbsp; It was well laid out in a traditional, hotel room, format.&nbsp; Two large wardrobes dominated one wall.&nbsp; Ann noticed that some clothes were laid out on the bed for her already.

�I hope you don&#8217;t mind, but I chose some clothes for you to wear for our days outing,� Nicky purred.

Ann walked over to the bed.&nbsp; The first item that caught her eye was a corset.&nbsp; No, she corrected herself, more like a girdle.&nbsp; However, the first item that Nicky pulled from the pile was a set of rubber panties.&nbsp; By the way they moved when Nicky picked them up, Ann could tell that there was something or more probably two something&#8217;s inside.&nbsp; Sure enough, when Nicky opened the panties, she reached for a tub of KY jelly, which she applied to the two mammoth, jell filled dildos within, before pulling them open in front of Ann at floor level.&nbsp; Ann dutifully stepped into the pants, which Nicky pulled up and guided into Ann&#8217;s pussy and ass.&nbsp; A few weeks ago, Ann would have run away screaming at such behaviour from a virtual stranger, but she had since lost most, if not all of her inhibitions in that respect and did not think to question her casual acceptance of the twin intruders until later.

The next item that Nicky held up for inspection was a&nbsp; silk gown, which was long enough to fall about two or, at a rough guess, three inches above the knee .&nbsp; This surprised Ann, as she would have expected something in rubber, or at least leather.&nbsp; Understanding her puzzled expression, Nicky smiled.

�During the summer, I would normally wear a similar garment in latex.&nbsp; But it is becoming bitterly cold outside.&nbsp; The last thing you need is a layer of sweat trapped between your skin and your underclothes.&nbsp; It would quickly turn to ice.&nbsp; Don'&#8217; worry, I have plenty of other things to keep you interested,� she smiled as she bunched it up and, as Ann raised her arms, lowered it over her head.

The next item was very familiar to Ann.&nbsp; The corset.&nbsp; This item was quite long so that, while it left her breasts uncovered, was longer than some skirts that she had worn.&nbsp; Ann stood with her arms apart while Nicky wrapped the corset girdle around her, fastening the front from just under her bust, all the way down to just above her knees.&nbsp; Nicky asked Ann to go to the foot of the bed, bend over and hold on to the bar at the foot of the bed.&nbsp; Once in position, Nicky grabbed the laces at the back of the garment and started pulling and pulling and pulling.&nbsp; By the time that Nicky had finished, Ann had gone beyond merely grunting at each savage tug.&nbsp; She could scarcely draw breath.&nbsp; However her posture and figure were stunning.&nbsp; Ann felt as though she had been squeezed into a steel pipe.&nbsp; 

Ann studied her reflection in a long, antique looking mirror in the corner of the room.&nbsp; She looked like some sort of extreme egg timer.&nbsp; The corsets that she had worn so far had curved in, describing a gradual arc.&nbsp; This pinched into an extreme fourteen or fifteen inches.&nbsp; 

�Wow,� she mused.

Looking down, Ann lifted her leg as Nicky pulled a silk stocking onto her foot, smoothing it gradually up her leg until she could attach it to three suspenders that hung down from the girdle.&nbsp; Nicky repeated the process on the other foot.&nbsp; Next she pulled out a set of ankle boots.&nbsp; At first glance, other than the six-inch heal, they appeared to be a normal set of black, leather boots.&nbsp; However, as Ann quickly discovered, they were a size too small for her and, by the time that Nicky had laced them up, they acted more like foot corsets, squeezing her feet into a tight, unyielding, leather prison.

The next item was a long, white cotton, petty coat.&nbsp; A white silk blouse followed next.&nbsp; This had an unusual silk tie around the neck.&nbsp; An ankle length, black, straight skirt followed.&nbsp; Ann was not sure where this outfit was going, but it looked Victorian or pre WW1.&nbsp; The last item was a formal black jacket.&nbsp; 

�There you are, nearly ready for our day out.&nbsp; We just need to do something with your hair.�

The something in question turned out to be a tight bun.&nbsp; As they walked towards the door, or hobbled in Ann&#8217;s case, Nicky turned to her own room.&nbsp; Ann noticed that, under her own garments, Nicky had the tell tail signs of a similar corset under her clothes.

�I will meet you downstairs in a minute,� Nicky stated as she headed for her own room.

Sure enough, Nicky descended the stairs wearing a similar outfit to Ann.&nbsp; Walking over to a closet by the front door, Nicky emerged with a top hat and a pair of leather gloves.&nbsp; The hat had a guars veil around the rim.&nbsp; Handing them to Ann, she reached into the cupboard for an exact same pair.

�Let&#8217;s go and find Dave shall we?� Nicky asked before stepping outside.

Ann followed behind as Nicky led the way to the stables.&nbsp; Now Ann knew what the outfit was about.&nbsp; It was an old fashioned riding outfit.&nbsp; Pulling on the gloves and placing the hat on her head,&nbsp; Ann trotted to fall in beside Nicky as they marched over to the stables.

Just as she suspected as they stepped inside, the carriage was already in position.&nbsp; This one was slightly larger than the one Ann had pulled.&nbsp; Ann thought that this was only fair, although by the look on his face, Dave did not agree.&nbsp; Ann considered hiding her smile, but thought better of it and grinned openly.

�Hello Dave, you look good,� Ann taunted as Dave glared at her.

Dave was dressed in a similar fashion to the outfit that Ann had worn yesterday, including boots and tail.&nbsp; Nicky had already climbed into the carriage and Ann walked to around the back and stepped up onto the cart.&nbsp; 

The cart that Ann had pulled yesterday had been light, with pram sized wheels and a forward facing seat.&nbsp; This version had larger, five foot wheels and seats on either side so that, when Ann sat down she was facing Nicky.&nbsp; The other woman had twisted her body, so that her torso faced the front, gripping the reigns with her left hand.&nbsp; A large whip had been attached to the front board of the carriage so that it rose from its slot vertically.&nbsp; The whip looked about four-foot tall, with a long length of platted leather snaking from the top, back down to the handle.&nbsp; Nicky pulled this out of the slot, giving it an experimental shake as she held it aloft.&nbsp; An evil grin spread across her face as she looked at Ann.

�I think that, after the way Dave treated you yesterday, he needs a lesson in how to look after animals.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go and get your belongings shall we?� Nicky purred as she flicked the whip, catching Dave on his naked right buttock, leaving a painful red line on his pale skin.

Ann did not have long to study the effects of Nicky&#8217;s expert marksmanship as Dave, spurred on by pain and shock, set off with a sudden jolt as he sprung out of the stable building and raced down the street, while Ann clung tightly to the rail, grinning broadly at the sudden turn of events.

Ann and Nicky chatted amiably as they sat in the cart trundling along the country roads.&nbsp; The occasional grunt or sound that could have been a swear word escaped through the bridal that Dave the horse wore, which earned him a flick of the whip.

�He doesn&#8217;t seem very happy,� Ann observed with a righteous grin as she remembered herself in a similar position only the day before.

�Nonsense, he is loving every minute of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will be stopping in about half a mile, so that the beast can catch his breath, you can see for yourself,� Nicki replied.

�I thought that this wouldn&#8217;t be Daves cup of tea, I mean he is a dom.�

�Whatever gave you that idea?&nbsp; Darling, Dave is most definitely a switch.&nbsp; You just haven&#8217;t pushed his submissive buttons, that&#8217;s all,� Nicky replied.

Sure enough, when they stopped to water and feed Dave he, or at least his member, seemed very happy with the situation.&nbsp; Although that is not strictly true, since the strange metal cage that imprisoned his cock seamed very uncomfortable to her.&nbsp; But Ann had to admit, while Dave was not happy, his body seamed to have other ideas.

Once they were rolling again, Ann expressed another of her concerns.

�In all fairness, now that I have located you, I should advise my client.&nbsp; She is, after all, paying for this,� Ann stated.

�Perhaps, but the next ferry back to the mainland is not for another day.&nbsp; It is not, after all, as though my stepmother can not afford it.&nbsp; Besides, you must stay for the festival.&nbsp; It is one of the main reasons why I chose to come here,� Nicky replied.

Perhaps another day would not hurt.&nbsp; After all, she did not have to charge the client for any time that she was not working for them.&nbsp; Having decided to stay until after the festival, Ann settled into her seat and enjoyed the site of Dave&#8217;s ass swishing what she knew to be a very irritating and uncomfortable tail back and forth, looking even more uncomfortable for the red welts criss-crossed on either cheek.

Although fitter than Ann, Dave still looked very tired when they reached the stables.&nbsp; Nicky quickly dismounted and went to have a word with the stable owner.&nbsp; Moments later, Dave was unhitched and being led to one of the stalls, while a stable hand filled up a nose bag full of oats.

Ann and Nicky made short work of packing and before long had hired one of the local men to carry the bags to be loaded onto the cart while the two women went for a leisurely afternoon tea at a small caf� in the high street.

�Mmmm.&nbsp; These scones are gorgeous,� Ann enthused as she tucked into one of the home made cakes that she had piled high with clotted cream and jam.

�Yes, they are rather good.&nbsp; The trick, of course, is to heat them first.&nbsp; You also need real clotted cream, rather than the spray stuff that they sell.&nbsp; I understand that the owner prides herself on having real clotted cream flown in.&nbsp; Well worth every penny I would say.�

The two women silently contemplated their cakes before returning to the stables.&nbsp; However, Ann was surprised to find that the cart had been changed.&nbsp; Instead of the cart that they had travelled out in, a larger, white covered carriage stood proudly in the yard.&nbsp; Three other pony boys had also joined Dave.&nbsp; The tack had been changed to white leather harnesses and boots, which were studded with silver.&nbsp; The chest harness was also adorned with small silver bells.&nbsp; Unfortunately for Dave, these horses, Ann could tell, were used to running.&nbsp; Their leg muscles looked lean and efficient and, although Dave was placed at the back left position, she could see that he would need a lot of carrying by the other ponies.&nbsp; Nicky grinned maniacally.

�Dave&#8217;s performance left a lot to be desired on the way over.&nbsp; I thought that he could use some help,� Nicky smirked.

Just as Ann had suspected, the trot back was a lot quicker than the trip out.&nbsp; Unfortunately for Dave, he had already expended a lot of energy on the outward journey.&nbsp; Keeping pace with three professional ponies soon had Dave out of breath.&nbsp; Nicky stated that he did not need nearly as many rests, since the other three would compensate for Dave&#8217;s lack of fitness.&nbsp; Never the less, it was an exhausted Dave who staggered into town three hours later.&nbsp; While the professional ponies were sweating, looking as though they had a reasonable work out, Dave looked like a man who had run the London marathon, having just eaten a full Sunday roast.&nbsp; Stable hands quickly unhitched the wagon and led the ponies into their straw covered rooms for the night.&nbsp; After gulping down at least a litre of water, Dave staggered, unseeing as he was led to his stall, collapsing in an exhausted heap onto a pile of straw.&nbsp; The stable hands placed food and water into the room and closed the stable doors, pushing home the heavy bolts that signified that Dave would be staying the night.

After returning to the house, both women quickly changed out of their riding gear.&nbsp; At Nickys suggestion, Ann put on a slinky red evening gown, with a pair of strappy four inch heals.&nbsp; Once suitably dressed, both women were ready for a meal and the local bistro provided an amiable place for the two women to relax after their tiring day.&nbsp; Ann found that the sea food spaghetti, with a dash of chilli, was particularly good.&nbsp; She was, therefore, pleasantly merry, having broken into a second bottle of the house white, when she staggered back to the house, supported by Nicky.

Once through the door, Ann found that Nickys support, soon turned into an embrace, which was quickly followed by a passionate French kiss.&nbsp; Perhaps it was the wine or the fact that she had experienced so much over the past few days, but while surprised, Ann was not shocked to find her belly fluttering, along with a certain amount of excitement from her suddenly wet pussy, as she returned the other woman&#8217;s kiss and began to run her hands over Nickys back and ass.

Reaching behind Ann to a coat rack, Nicky produced a dog collar and lead.

�Lets explore that submissive streak of yours shall we?� Nicky whispered into Ann&#8217;s ear as she attached to dog collar around the aroused girls neck.

�Yes Mistress,� Ann whispered as she looked down meekly.

Nicky smiled predatorily and tugged on the leash as her new slave followed behind her to a door under the stairs.

Ann was not surprised to see that the door opened to reveal another set of steps leading down.&nbsp; Nor was she surprised at the lavishly equipped stone dungeon that she found when she reached the bottom.

�Strip Slave, while I change,� Nicky commanded as she left the leash dangling and strode behind a changing screen.

Ann did not need telling twice and quickly disrobed, shedding everything apart from the collar and leash.&nbsp; After several minutes, Nicky returned wearing rubber stockings and heals, a tight rubber waspy, opera gloves and collar.&nbsp; Her naked breasts and shaved pussy quickly catching Ann&#8217;s attention.

�There is something that I have been meaning to try out, but have not been able to find a slave to try it on.&nbsp; You will just have to do you worthless slut,� Nicky smirked as she pulled the leashed girl over to a strange metal frame.

The contraption was a cube frame with obvious steal cuffs, that she could see where she would be secured and a strange metal rod that ran along the bottom towards a seat of some sort, at the front of the frame.&nbsp; Ann did not have long to contemplate this as her mistress pushed her down into the frame so that she was kneeling on all fours.

A steel collar, attached by a metal bar to the top of the frame was quickly secured around her neck, holding her firmly in place on all fours.&nbsp; A leather strap, attached to the rod, was pulled tightly around her for head and buckled at the back of the pole, securing her head firmly in place, facing forwards. A leather penis gag, with an internal and external penis, was quickly secured to the same metal pole.&nbsp; Another metal shaft descended from the middle of the frame.&nbsp; Again a two semicircles of steel were used as a restraint, fitting tightly around her waist.&nbsp; The two halves were forced together and locked in place with a simple catch.&nbsp; Ann grunted as Nicky pulled one of her arms behind her and attached her wrist to a steel cuff that was attached to the pole imprisoning her mid section, so that her arm was pulled painfully upwards behind her.&nbsp; Nicky repeated the process with the other arm, before securing her ankles in steel cuffs attached to the bottom rear of the frame, spreading her legs fully open.

Ann puzzled as Nicky fiddled behind her.&nbsp; She could not see, but felt the cold tip of the steel intruders that she placed over the entrance to her anus and pussy, lubricating both with KY, before clamping them in position.&nbsp; These were attached to another vertical steel rod, this time ascending from the central rod, rather than descending from the steel lattice work at the roof of the cube.&nbsp; 

Moving forward, Nicky began to massage Ann&#8217;s nipples.&nbsp; Ann was not, however, totally surprised, when the other woman attached a nipple clamp to first one and then the other erect nipple.&nbsp; These clamps were attached by chain to the central rod and Nicky adjusted the tension until the tight chains pulled Ann&#8217;s breasts painfully downwards.

Stepping in front of her captive, Nicky began to play with herself until her pussy was dripping.&nbsp; Lifting her juice covered finger to her mouth, Nicky licked along the length of the digit, maintaining eye contact with her new slave.

�My, you look good enough to eat,� Nicky whispered in a husky voice.&nbsp; �But I have a better idea.�

Nicky swayed over to the strange seat in front of Ann&#8217;s head and sat down, placing her feet on metal plates on either side of the frame and positioning the height and position of the seat, using knobs similar to those found in cars, on either side of the metal seat, until her dripping pussy was impaled by the long dildo sticking out from the front of Ann&#8217;s penis gag.&nbsp; Leaning back into the seat, Nicky picked up a box and pointed it behind her captive. 

�Your going to love this,� she whispered as she pressed a button on the control box.&nbsp; 

Ann heard the his of compressed air as the rod pushed forward, impaling her ass and pussy with the steel dildoes that Nicky had positioned earlier.&nbsp; To her surprise, Nicky and the seat were moved backwards, as though on rails, as the rod was pushed forward.&nbsp; The shock of penetration and the painful pull as her tits and nipples were wrenched painfully forward made her scream into the gag.&nbsp; Reaching the end of the stroke, Ann only just registered the sound of escaping air hissing behind her as the pneumatic ram was pulled violently backwards, shoving Nickys pussy forcefully onto her penis gag. Before she could feel relief, the stroke pulled her pussy forward again, repeating the painful cycle.

Nicky groaned as she was continually impaled Anns penis gag, as the chair moved violently forwards and backwards, putting the control on automatic, she dropped the box in order to massage her pussy.

Ann screamed into the gag again as indescribable pain erupted into her pussy and ass.

�Isn&#8217;t it great Ann, Isn&#8217;t it wonderful,� Nicky groaned as she massaged her tits, tilting her head backwards.&nbsp; �That jolt you just felt was ten thousand volts.&nbsp; The machine will do that, its on a random program.&nbsp; It will shock your tits, your cunt, your ass, your argggh, unghh, arrr, the other woman moaned as she built towards orgasm.&nbsp; 

Finally, after several orgasms, Nicky was finally sated and stopped the machine, climbing off of the chair and staggering over to bend down next to Anns head.&nbsp; �

I think I will leave you hear for the night my sweet.&nbsp; But don&#8217;t worry, I will leave the machine in random mode.&nbsp; According to the manual, it will jolt and fuck you at random times throughout the night.&nbsp; Try and get some sleep between cycles, I think you are going to need all of your strength.�

With that, Nicky stood and staggered towards the door, while Ann screamed her protest into her gag.&nbsp; But before Nicky had opened the door, Ann felt the twin shafts move suddenly forward, impaling her painfully, as her nipples were wrenched forward.&nbsp; Ann&#8217;s protests however, were ignored and dismissed with finality as the dungeon door closed with a resounding thud, sealing her alone in her dungeon and the prospect of a night of pain, torture and sexual abuse.&nbsp; Ann did not know weather to be terrified, excited or both.

Ann had lost track of time and the number of orgasms that she had experienced.&nbsp; She only knew that she was tired and that her body could not stand much more of this.&nbsp; Her nipples, pussy and ass were sore from the pounding, stretching and shocks that they had received.&nbsp; Then, she heard a noise.&nbsp; Perhaps she was imagining things, perhaps she was so exhausted that she wanted to hear someone else.&nbsp; Perhaps and then it stopped.&nbsp; The pistons and shocks and everything else just stopped.&nbsp; It took her a moment to realise this, as she was expecting something else and that this was only a pause while the frame switched onto another program of events.&nbsp; But that was not the case and, moments later, relief flooded through her as she felt her bonds being undone and the intruders removed from her abused sex and ass.

�You didn&#8217;t really think that I would leave you like this all night did you?� a familiar voice whispered into her ear as Ann felt her gag being loosened.

As the gag came loose and was pulled from her mouth she tried to form words, a response of some kind.&nbsp; But no words came out.&nbsp; All that she could do was pant as she knelt, hot and very sweaty, on all fours.

Nicky pulled her out of the cube and carried her upstairs.

Ann woke early the next morning.&nbsp; It was still dark outside.&nbsp; She was still naked and very sore.&nbsp; She was in bed, but not, she felt, the bed that was in her room.&nbsp; To begin with, rather than the quaint, old fashioned linen of her room, these sheets were made from rubber.&nbsp; Also, although it was dark, she could still here the rhythmic breathing of somebody in the bed next to her.&nbsp; Ann rolled over, flinging her arm over the top of the other body, spooning in tightly to the other woman and sliding her arm into the gap between Nicky&#8217;s breasts as she again settled back into sleep.

The next time that Lisa awoke, it was daylight and she was alone in bed.&nbsp; The unmistakable noises of morning filtered up from downstairs as dishes clanked and the sound of food being fried were accompanied by the smell of food that was undoubtedly so full of cholesterol that you could probably feel your arteries hardening as you ate.

Sure enough, after a glorious soak in the tub, when Ann eventually made her way down stairs, wrapped in a thick towelling robe, she found Dave sitting at the breakfast table looking slightly the worst for wear, but with the satisfied grin of somebody who had just eaten his fill, the remains of a full English clearly visible on his plate. (Toast, sausages, fried eggs, tomatoes, hash browns, bacon and beans, while black pudding and mushrooms are usually optional)&nbsp; 

After a more conservative breakfast, Ann went upstairs to get changed.&nbsp; Nicky had told them that, as part of the Christmas celebrations, a festive market was on today, part of the day long celebrations that would not conclude until well into the night.
Ann rummaged through her clothes and eventually settled on a high neck, red rubber cat suit, with knee length, patent leather boots and a thick, red rubber waist sincher, which reduced her waist to the tiny proportions that she was rapidly beginning to accept as normal, while throwing her bust into sharp relief.&nbsp; After putting her hair into a pony tail, putting on make up and pulling on a short pair of red rubber gloves, Ann finally dons a concession to the cold weather outside, a white, fake fur, jacket that had just the right amount of snuggle factor.&nbsp; Picking up her hand back, she made her way down stairs.

After another ten minutes the trio was finally ready and set off for the village centre.&nbsp; In many respects, it was a typical Christmas fair.&nbsp; Stall sold mulled wine, mince pies and home made Christmas puddings.&nbsp; Others sold decorations, home made cards and the usual nick-nacks.&nbsp; However, interspersed with the usual gifts were other, more interesting items, like a pony girl harness with novelty antlers and red nose or festive fury hand cuffs with holly detail.&nbsp; Once stall sold a cute red mummy sack that was made to look like a Christmas stocking.&nbsp; After an hour and with several items already in bags, the three stopped for coffee at a local caf�.&nbsp; 

�I am in two minds about the Scolds Bridal,� Nicky confided as she sipped her tea.

�Why not buy it then?&nbsp; I am sure that you will get hours of fun from it,�&nbsp; Ann pointed out.

�It&#8217;s not that I couldn&#8217;t use the bridal.&nbsp; Did you see the metal loops at the bottom of the cage?�

Ann shook her head.

�They are so that you can attach straps, that allow you to secure the bridal to a collar.&nbsp; I think I have something at home that will fit, but I am not sure.&nbsp; I just don&#8217;t want to buy the bridal and a new collar as well, not at the price he is asking,� Nicky confided.

�Why not just pop back to the house and get the collar.&nbsp; See if it fits and that way you will know,� Dave suggested.

�OK�, Nicky decided, �but you stay here and finish your tea.&nbsp; I should only be about ten minutes and then we can finish the shopping.�

After a quick gulp of tea, Nicky stood up with her purchases and, with a quick wave, was out of the door striding confidently towards the house.&nbsp; This was definitely a woman in the grip of a shopping decision.&nbsp; Ann and Dave finished their tea and headed back out to the market.&nbsp; While she was away, they decided to take the opportunity to buy her a little something for Christmas morning.

After forty minutes, however, Nicky had not returned and so Ann told Dave to sit with the shopping while she returned to the house to find out what was keeping Nicky.&nbsp; Fortunately, Ann had been given a spare key and after letting herself in, started to search for the other woman.

After checking the ground floor and upstairs, Ann decided that Nicky must be downstairs, in the dungeon.&nbsp; This, Ann decided, was the obvious place to look for a collar and so she set off down the cellar stairs.

Upon opening the cellar door, Ann noticed that the lights were on as she was assailed by an unmistakable noise.&nbsp; The sound of a pneumatic piston.&nbsp; The same piston that she had heard last night.&nbsp; She also noticed that she was not alone.&nbsp; Mrs Birgitt stood next to the cube, wearing a tight, black leather cat suite, wearing gloves and high healed boots.&nbsp; Ann&#8217;s eyes flicked to the cubes occupant, Nicky.&nbsp; She was naked and in a similar position to that Ann had been in the previous night.&nbsp; However, she did not look happy and, after a few moments listening to the piston ram its twin invaders into the bound girl, Ann knew why.&nbsp; Last night, the machine seemed to have been on a slower, less brutal setting.&nbsp; Ann was willing to bet that, judging by the way Nicky&#8217;s body jearked, that this was probably set much higher.

�How good of you to join us my dear.&nbsp; Your presence complicates matters somewhat, but I think I can work something out,� the older woman stated with obvious relish and not a small amount of venom.

�What are you doing here and why is Nicky in the cube?&nbsp; I have not known her long, but I think I know enough to know that she does not like playing the submissive.�

�You may be right but it doesn&#8217;t really matter.�

�How did you find us so quickly?&nbsp; Have you been following me,� Ann enquired as she moved further into the room.

�Of course I have and what a spectacle you have made of yourself.&nbsp; I must admit that, when I hired you I never expected you to be quite so enthusiastic or that you would prove to be such a wanton slut.&nbsp; I imagine that you have many questions, so I will try to answer them as well as I can, to put your mind at ease,� Mrs Birgitt purred as she edged towards the other woman.

�Your research may have shown that Nickys father, my husband died recently.&nbsp; You probably know that we are quite a wealthy family.&nbsp; What you probably don&#8217;t know is that he has left everything to his daughter.&nbsp; After all that I have put up with from that man, after all of these years, I would not get a penny.&nbsp; Unless Nicky dies before the will is read.&nbsp; Then, as the only surviving member of the family, well I am sure that I don&#8217;t need to tell you who gets their hands on over one hundred and twenty million?�

Mrs Birgitt had circled around and was now within ten foot of Ann who stood, seemingly transfixed by the other woman&#8217;s monologue which would not have been out of place in a movie where the super villain was explaining all to the hapless hero.

�When Nicky disappeared, I knew that she wanted to stay out of my way until the legal formalities could be settled.&nbsp; So I hired you and followed you.&nbsp; What an interesting time that proved to be.&nbsp; I had originally planned to ensure that my daughter died in a tragic accident in one of her perverse machines.&nbsp; One reads about such things occasionally.&nbsp; Your presence complicates things, of course.&nbsp; But I am sure that, when they discover your body strapped to the strange chair on this machine, with a rope around your neck and a set of keys on the floor, just out of reach, nobody will dig too deeply into the death of two perverted sluts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once who strangled herself in some weird sex game and the other who, finding herself trapped in a machine with all of the safety features turned off, died of internal haemorrhaging due to the excessive brutality of being raped to death by a particularly powerful double dildo.&nbsp; What do you think?&nbsp; After all, I was never here.&nbsp; All I have to do is put on the leather mask that I arrived in, step outside and nobody would be able to tell me from any other pervert who visits this island.&nbsp; What do you think, is it a good plan?�

Before waiting for a response, Mrs Birgitt produced a large knife from where she had been hiding it behind her back.&nbsp; Although Ann had been exploring her submissive side recently, it did not mean that she was just going to stand by and be led to the slaughter by this woman.&nbsp; Especially with all of the martial arts training that she had acquired as a necessity of her profession.

Mrs Birgitt obviously had not expected quite such a violent reaction as Ann&#8217;s left foot, describing a wide right to left arc, connected with her right hand.&nbsp; She seemed quite shocked as the knife spun from her grasp and landed with a clatter at the back of the room.&nbsp; She was even more shocked when, as Ann&#8217;s left foot landed, her right foot came up and connected with her chest, propelling her across the room to hit a steel upright belonging to a metal frame of some sort.&nbsp; Mrs Birgitt bounced off of the frame as she made to clutch at the pain in her chest caused from the stiletto heal crashing into her rib cage.&nbsp; Her momentum propelled her towards Ann who grabbed her right wrist and twisted her body into the other woman&#8217;s, slipping her right arm under the Mrs Birgitts arm.&nbsp; Momentarily, the two women were spooned together as Ann bent at the knees.&nbsp; Straightening up sharply, she flicked her right leg backwards as she pulled forward, sending the older woman crashing towards the ground at 120 mph.

Mrs Birgitt lay on the ground groaning, the air knocked from her lunges and could do nothing as Ann quickly found some cuffs and soon had her lying on her front in a brutal hog tie.

Although the local police were called, they seemed quite reluctant to process the matter in the normal way.&nbsp; It would, apparently, stir up too much publicity for the island, which made a great deal of money from being very discrete and valued it&#8217;s anonymity.

�Don&#8217;t worry madam, we have our own methods of dealing with such things,� the burley policeman informed Ann as Mrs Birgitt&nbsp; was led away and Nicky was being seen by the local doctor.

Hours later, having giving a statement to the police, Ann, Nicky and Dave stood outside to watch Mrs Birgitt receive the start of her punishment.&nbsp; All were wrapped up warmly against the cold winter night, sipping from mugs of hot chocolate as the, along with a sizeable crowd , watched Mrs Birgitt, who was dressed as a particularly fetishist, pink rubber fairy, being winched high into the air to adorn the top of the village Christmas tree.

The captive woman had stopped struggling by now and seemed resigned to her fate as she was hauled up into the air, standing stride a strange plastic cone, that her ankles were tied to, which would allow her to sit securely on top of the tree.

Everybody cheered as the fairy was finally secured and the lights were turned on.&nbsp; She would, according to the policeman, be quite co-operative when she came down in three days time, when she would begin her sentence as one of the islands slaves.

Epilogue

Ann finished dusting the large manner house, dressed in a black and white, saucy rubber maids outfit.&nbsp; Nicky had bought this place on the island after she had inherited her fathers money.&nbsp; Her step mother did not show up for the reading of the will.&nbsp; Nicky and Dave had left for a few weeks to sort out some business on the mainland.&nbsp; Ann had moved in with them more or less straight away.&nbsp; Nicky had helped her to set up her own offices on the island.&nbsp; Because it was known that she was very discrete and could work easily within the fetish community, she was never out of work.&nbsp; However, at the moment, she was house sitting.&nbsp; Scooping the contents of a tin of dog food into a metal bowl, she strode outside on five inch, stiletto court shoes. 

She was greeted warmly by the family pet Fluffy.&nbsp; They had bought Fluffy, formerly known as Mrs Birgitt, at the slave auctions and used her in a variety of roles from pony girl to pain slut to her current role as dog.&nbsp; She was one of several people who had been sold by the local police.&nbsp; Due to the serious nature of her crimes, Mrs Birgitt was sold as a slave for life, rather than a fixed term.&nbsp; People occasionally went missing on the island and Mrs Birgitt was one of a very few lifers who would never appear in society again.&nbsp; She had her own yard and kennel outside.&nbsp; She wore a set of leather paws on her hands that bunched her hands into balls.&nbsp; Her ankles were tied to her thighs and secured in a lace up leather boot, with a dog paw at the knee joint for her to walk on.&nbsp; She had a long, whippy tail stuck in her ass and sported a set of dog ears.&nbsp; Her body had also been painted brown and she wore a dog collar that was chained to the dog house.&nbsp; Talking was not allowed and so Fluffy barked and wagged her tail as Ann set the bowl down in front of her and patted her on the head.&nbsp; Ann smiled as she returned to the house to the sound of contented munching noises.

After making a cup of coffee, she sat down to watch a DVD.&nbsp; She had found one with her name on it.&nbsp; It would be several hours until Nicky and Dave returned and so she inserted it into the machine, leaned back and prepared to see what the DVD contained.&nbsp; 

She was surprised to see herself on a security camera knocking on the door to Nicky&#8217;s old flat.&nbsp; She remembered this, she had let herself in and started searching for clues.&nbsp; She was shocked, therefore, when someone opened the door.&nbsp; The view changed to an internal camera.&nbsp; Dave was leading her inside to the living room.&nbsp; The audio was not the best quality but she could clearly hear herself discussing the old case.

�So I was hoping that I might look through her papers and see if I could find out where she had gone,� she herd herself tell Dave.

�Well she did leave this behind,� Dave said as he held up a pendant.&nbsp; 

Ann watched as he twirled the pendant in front of her other selves eyes.

�It is quite an unusual pendant.&nbsp; See how it glints in the light, how beautiful it is.&nbsp; Look deeply into the colours that it makes Ann, look deeply.�

Ann could not believe what she was seeing, but after several moments she saw her head loll forward.

�You are in a deep sleep Ann.&nbsp; You will not remember this conversation.&nbsp; Instead you will remember letting yourself in and searching the room.&nbsp; When you hear the words rubber whore you will fall into a deep sleep.&nbsp; You will find a room in this flat full of bondage equipment and rubber outfits.&nbsp; You will find become very turned on by the outfits and will dress in the sexiest outfit that you can find.&nbsp; You will also tie yourself onto the thing that looks like a saw horse.&nbsp; You will get very horny as you do this.&nbsp; When I join you, do whatever I say.&nbsp; You will always do whatever I say.&nbsp; When I leave you will wake up.&nbsp; You will not remember anything, but will do as I have said.� 

Ann would have been angry, but her code word had been mentioned and, just as her other self woke up as Dave left the apartment, so did she.&nbsp; Getting up, she headed for the dungeon.&nbsp; She felt very horny as she thought of the dungeon full of rubber clothes that she was going to have fun in for the next few hours.&nbsp; She had forgotten about the video.&nbsp; She had forgotten about everything but the need to change into a rubber outfit and tie herself up for her master.
