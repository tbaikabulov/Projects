Synopsis:    A man goes through hell at the hands of his wife and her lover before finding heaven from an unexpected source.






I was supposed to sleep, but who could possibly sleep after the beating I had endured.&nbsp; I was sure they had tried to kill me.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t want to sleep; this was the night I had waited for&#8212;the night I had prayed for--after more than eighteen months in captivity.
It was still dark&#8212;dark as pitch-- and very early.&nbsp; I leaned up from the floor to try to see the clock&#8212;3:27&#8212;perfect, or so I prayed.&nbsp; Rebecca and Mark were drunk after their celebration when they went to sleep last night&#8212;maybe passed out would be more accurate.&nbsp; They&#8217;d made a huge mistake.&nbsp; Hopefully it would prove fatal&#8212;their last in this lifetime.&nbsp; It was the first night in more than eighteen months that I hadn&#8217;t been locked to the bed frame or handcuffed behind my back, or in a cell in the basement.&nbsp; I struggled to my feet, the impact of last night&#8217;s lengthy whipping driving the pain through my body.&nbsp; It was all I could do to remain silent as I tiptoed out of the room, another big mistake--not locking the door--and down the hallway to what used to be my study.&nbsp; I was absolutely forbidden to enter this room, but what could they do to me?&nbsp; I knew they planned to kill me. What difference could a week or even a day possibly make?&nbsp; I felt my way in, afraid to use the light.&nbsp; I found my way to the shelves and ran my fingers along the top.&nbsp; It was still there, thank God!
The key slid in easily, the locked door opened, and I felt inside for my pistol.&nbsp; A minute later the 9 mm my wife didn&#8217;t know about was loaded.&nbsp; I had bought it only two days before my torment began, not mentioning it to my wife who I knew would be opposed.&nbsp; I&#8217;d only need four shells in the magazine if everything worked out the way I planned.&nbsp; I racked the slide as slowly and quietly as I could and slid the safety off.&nbsp; I knew my arms had atrophied over the last year and a half from constantly being in an arm binder or handcuffs, but I was sure I&#8217;d still be able to aim and pull the trigger.
Back in the bedroom I leaned over the bed, my left arm resting on the headboard, placing the barrel an inch from Mark&#8217;s head and pulled the trigger.&nbsp; BLAM!! The explosion reverberated as the smoke and odor of cordite spread throughout the room.&nbsp;&nbsp; His head shook violently as blood and brain spattered against the wall and when Rebecca responded by sitting up suddenly I rammed the pistol into her mouth, cocking the hammer so the least effort would send her on to oblivion.&nbsp; �I HATE YOU!&nbsp; YOU&#8217;RE A FUCKING BITCH.&nbsp; I HOPE YOU ROT IN HELL.&nbsp; THE ONLY THING WRONG IS THAT YOU&#8217;RE NOT GOING TO SUFFER ONE THOUSANDTH OF ONE PERCENT OF WHAT YOU PUT ME THROUGH.�&nbsp; I fired again, BLAM!!&nbsp; She fell back to the pillow, the blood oozing from the hole in her skull.&nbsp; I placed the gun against her forehead and fired again.&nbsp; I repeated with Mark.&nbsp; Free at last, free at last; thank God almighty I was free at last!
Now all I had to do was find one of their cell phones.&nbsp; There were no phones in the house. I couldn&#8217;t ever contact the outside world for help in the unlikely event I ever had an opportunity.&nbsp; The doors were locked with built-in combination locks so I couldn&#8217;t open them and escape either.&nbsp; The windows were covered with thick bullet proof polycarbonate.&nbsp; The past eighteen months had been a nightmare of pain and anguish, but I was still alive&#8212;barely&#8212;and it was going to get better.&nbsp; It had to because I knew from experience that it couldn&#8217;t possibly get any worse.
I looked in Rebecca&#8217;s purse, but no phone.&nbsp; I dug through Mark&#8217;s clothes, but no luck there either.&nbsp; I checked under the bed&#8212;nothing.&nbsp; I found a locked cabinet in Rebecca&#8217;s closet, but repeated efforts with my weak arms got me nowhere.&nbsp; I had to find the key.&nbsp; I thought she&#8217;d keep it close and I was right&#8212;she had it under the mattress.&nbsp; Her phone and wallet were in the locked compartment along with her jewelry.&nbsp; I figured out how to turn it on and dialed 911.&nbsp; I spoke when the operator answered.
�I want to report a double homicide.&nbsp; My name is Jonathan Keller and I live at 731 Mayfaire. That&#8217;s where I am now.&nbsp; Tell the officers who respond that I cannot open the doors or the windows.&nbsp; They have special locks that I can&#8217;t open.&nbsp; No�it&#8217;s a very long story.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll explain to the officers when they come.&nbsp; I had to do it.&nbsp; They were going to kill me and there&#8217;s another life at stake, too.&nbsp; Please send some EMT&#8217;s.&nbsp; I have some severe injuries.&nbsp; No�there was no fight.&nbsp; I shot them while they were sleeping.&nbsp; I was tortured and whipped last night.&nbsp; I was whipped and tortured every night, but last night was the worst.&nbsp; They tried to kill me, but I got them first.
�Tell the officers that the gun is empty and on the coffee table.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sitting on the couch and that&#8217;s where I&#8217;ll be when they get here.&nbsp; Please remember to tell them that I can&#8217;t open the door.&nbsp; I mean them no harm.&nbsp; Yes, I&#8217;ll stay on the line�.�
I could hear the sirens in the distance growing louder as they approached.&nbsp; Finally, they stopped and I could hear the policemen yell for me to come out with my hands in the air.&nbsp; I spoke to the 911 operator, �Didn&#8217;t you tell them that I can&#8217;t get the doors open?&nbsp; There&#8217;s going to be an incident here and if they kill me an innocent kid will also die.&nbsp; No, I&#8217;m not going to kill him.&nbsp; He&#8217;s in the dungeon without any food or water.&nbsp; They&#8217;ll never find it without my help.&nbsp; Please tell them I&#8217;m not a threat to them.&nbsp; They need to break down the door.&nbsp; Please.�
The �stand-off� continued for another fifteen minutes before I figured out what to do.&nbsp; �Operator, can I speak directly to the officers?�
�Hello, is this the man in the house?�
�Yes, sir, it is.&nbsp; I tried to explain that I can&#8217;t open the doors.&nbsp; Believe me I would if I could.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been a prisoner here in my own house for the last year and a half.&nbsp; I need help.&nbsp; I was whipped&#8212;my back and legs, and chest&#8212;for hours last night.&nbsp; I&#8217;m losing blood and the pain is terrible.&nbsp; I&#8217;m in an extremely weakened condition.&nbsp; Please break down the door and help me.�
�What&#8217;s this about some kid?�
�They kidnapped him off the street last night.&nbsp; I was tied up in the van when they jumped him.&nbsp; Rebecca was driving and Mark grabbed the poor kid.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll need my help to find him.&nbsp; Please hurry.&nbsp; The gun is unloaded and broken down on the table.&nbsp; I&#8217;m on the couch.&nbsp; In the name of God�please.�
I heard some noise outside the door about ten minutes later.&nbsp; I was warned not to try anything and they broke down the door minutes later.&nbsp; I sat calmly on the couch in my housecoat, the only clothing I was permitted, indeed the only clothing I owned.&nbsp; �Thank God you&#8217;re finally here.&nbsp; The ones I killed are down the hall on the right at the very end&#8212;two shots to the head for each of them, may they rest in hell.�
A detective came and sat next to me.&nbsp; �Want to tell me what this is all about?�
�Sure�it all started almost two years ago.&nbsp; Rebecca was�still is�my wife.&nbsp; She was a surgeon.&nbsp; I was an attorney.&nbsp; She started to get a little kinky, you know&#8212;tying me up before sex and stuff like that.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t mind right up until she handcuffed me downstairs and whipped me for more than an hour.&nbsp; I hung from the rafters for hours afterwards and that was when she introduced me to her boyfriend.&nbsp; That&#8217;s him in there, too.&nbsp; She gave me a shot to knock me out and when I woke up I looked like this.�&nbsp; Standing up I dropped the housecoat.&nbsp; He gasped&#8212;they all did&#8212;when they saw my breasts.&nbsp; �Yeah, she operated on me and gave me breasts.&nbsp; These are bigger than the initial ones, but imagine the shock on my face when I saw them.
�I was handcuffed into the bed, not that I could have done much after the surgery.&nbsp; I lay there helplessly while she locked this cock cage onto my genitals.&nbsp; It&#8217;s solid stainless steel and she used super glue on the threads.&nbsp; It hasn&#8217;t come off in all that time and then there&#8217;s my back.�&nbsp; I turned around so they could see.
�Dear God!&nbsp; What the�?�&nbsp; My back looked like a city road map, covered with scars and cuts and scabs in every direction from the whippings and beatings I had received.&nbsp; My skin tore every time I twisted or moved.&nbsp; I was bleeding badly and the surface of my back was raw.&nbsp; The EMT&#8217;s tried to put me on a gurney, but I stopped them.
�The kid&#8212;we have to find him.�&nbsp; I led them into the pantry explaining that I had never done this before.&nbsp; Mark was always in front of me and I couldn&#8217;t see what he did.&nbsp; I told them I thought the shelves moved or slid back out of the way.&nbsp; We tried everything for more than twenty minutes until one of the officers accidentally tripped the lever.&nbsp; The rear panel of shelves pushed back revealing a hidden walkway.&nbsp; It led us down below the ground.&nbsp; There were all kinds of torture devices there.&nbsp; I ought to know&#8212;they were all used on me.&nbsp; I walked past them to the cells&#8212;small rooms made of poured reinforced concrete with steel bars over the doorway; the only furniture was a basic bed with a thin mattress and no pillow or blanket.&nbsp; I&#8217;d spent many an uncomfortable night naked in one of these.&nbsp; The kid was in the last one, blindfolded, handcuffed, and ears stopped up with beeswax.&nbsp; I told the police that I didn&#8217;t know where the keys were or even what they looked like. They&#8217;d have to cut the steel to get in.&nbsp; Some firemen came in a half hour later with a heavy-duty saw.&nbsp; The startled young man was released half an hour after that.&nbsp; I was relieved.
I finally allowed myself to be lowered onto a gurney.&nbsp; I cringed when they laid me on my back.&nbsp; They apologized and helped me roll over, not that that was much better.&nbsp; A pillow under my head and chest was a big help.&nbsp; Minutes later I was in the hospital&#8217;s emergency room.&nbsp; My vital signs were a mess.&nbsp; My pulse was 42; my blood pressure was 74 over 40.&nbsp; I weighed 97 pounds, less than half my original weight.
�How long did you say you were a prisoner in your home?�
�A year and a half, I think, at least that&#8217;s what they told me.�
�I&#8217;m surprised you survived.&nbsp; What did they feed you?&nbsp; It obviously wasn&#8217;t very much.�
�Actually, they gave me plenty&#8212;all the piss I could drink and all the shit I could eat.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not kidding.&nbsp; I refused to eat it so they forced a big ring gag into my mouth.&nbsp; They poured their piss into a funnel.&nbsp; I almost drowned a few times.&nbsp; They ground up their shit and forced it down my throat.&nbsp; Somewhere in the house is a big jar of antibiotics they fed me every day so on top of everything else I went for months with diarrhea.&nbsp; You&#8217;re right&#8212;it&#8217;s a miracle I survived.�
They treated and bandaged my back before addressing the wounds to my tits.&nbsp; Now that I was free they were definitely going and as soon as possible.&nbsp; I was sent to a room where the IV was replaced.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was also given protein drinks and Gator Ade to help with my bodily fluids.&nbsp; I lay back to sleep, noticing the police officer standing outside my door.&nbsp; I called to him, �Would you like a chair?&nbsp; There&#8217;s no reason why you should be uncomfortable?&nbsp; Please take one of mine.&nbsp; Nobody will come to visit me.�&nbsp; I lay back on the pillow and was asleep seconds later.
Well, I was wrong&#8212;I had visitors and plenty of them.&nbsp; The first was an inspector from our local police.&nbsp; He read me my rights and I signed a form that stated he had.&nbsp; He asked if I wanted an attorney.&nbsp; �No, I&#8217;ll speak with you.&nbsp; I really have nothing to hide.�&nbsp; Then he asked me to tell the whole story.&nbsp; �I was once a very happily married man.&nbsp; I thought things couldn&#8217;t get any better.&nbsp; I had a great career and a beautiful successful wife who loved me.&nbsp; We had great times together.&nbsp; About two years ago she wanted to do some kinky things as part of our sex life.&nbsp; First, she had me tie her to the bed and make love to her.&nbsp; Then we switched.&nbsp; It was pretty incredible.&nbsp; I had no idea at the time where she was getting these ideas, but I found out one night when she said she wanted to tie me up in the basement, tease me, and fuck my brains out.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what she promised me so I went along.
�She surprised me when she handcuffed me to a chain around the steel I-beam in our basement.&nbsp; I told her I didn&#8217;t want it any more and she just laughed, &#8216;Too late for that.&nbsp; You&#8217;re my prisoner now and that&#8217;s how you&#8217;re going to stay.&#8217;&nbsp; I never imagined I would be her prisoner for more than a year and a half.&nbsp; She beat me for the first time that night&#8212;my back and chest with a cane.&nbsp; When I screamed she filled my mouth with a leather ball gag.&nbsp; The beating went on for more than an hour and when she was done she told me, and this is a quote, &#8216;I am so hot now�so ready to fuck.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it won&#8217;t be you I&#8217;ll be fucking.&#8217;&nbsp; She turned away and opened a door to one of the store rooms.&nbsp; This big guy, even bigger than me, walked out with a huge smile on his face.&nbsp; He kissed Rebecca and she kissed him back.&nbsp; She stripped and fucked him right in front of me.&nbsp; When she was done she walked to me and lifted my head.&nbsp; &#8216;You know, Jonathan, I really enjoy hurting you.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what Mark and I are going to do.&nbsp; We&#8217;re both sadists.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t know that when I married you, but I know it now.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to beat you every night and during the day you can rest and build up your strength right here in our lovely basement while Mark and I enjoy ourselves and your money.&nbsp; But first, I need to leave my mark on you.&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She swabbed my elbow and stuck me with a hypodermic.&nbsp; I fell asleep hanging from my shoulders.
�When I awoke I was still in the basement in a hospital bed, my wrists and ankles secured to the frame.&nbsp; &#8216;Lookie, lookie,&#8217; she called to me.&nbsp; When I did I saw she had operated on me and given me breasts.&nbsp; They were only C-cups then, but she did it two more times, getting me all the way up to double-D.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t ask me why she did it; she never did tell me.&nbsp; I can only assume she wanted to humiliate me.&nbsp; I recall falling asleep again and when I woke up she put the chastity cage on me.&nbsp; I remember what she said to me then, too. &#8216;You&#8217;re going to give me tons of pleasure with your pain and suffering.&nbsp; You, however, will have none.&nbsp; This cannot be cut off without killing you and I&#8217;m sealing the threads with super glue.&nbsp; This is never coming off you.&#8217;&nbsp; And then she laughed like a maniac.&nbsp; That was more frightening than anything else she&#8217;d done until then.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t realize how sick she was.&nbsp; If I had I probably would have taken my life given the opportunity.
�After a few days my wounds bad begun to heal, but I was terribly weak from lack of water and food. I begged for water and they laughed.&nbsp; They said something about recycling their precious water.&nbsp; I tried to refuse, but they&#8217;d use the ring gag and tie off the sides to the bed so I couldn&#8217;t move.&nbsp; Then they poured urine into my mouth.&nbsp; Later they fed me their shit.&nbsp; If I gagged or threw up they&#8217;d cover my mouth with a pink towel and I&#8217;d have to swallow my own vomit, too.&nbsp; After a week they forced my hands behind my -body and cuffed them together.&nbsp; They pulled me from the bed and tied my cuffed wrists to the I-beam.&nbsp; My wrists were forced up until I thought my shoulders would separate.&nbsp; They beat me again and again with the crop and cane and even with an old belt I had.&nbsp; They left me in that position for days&#8212;maybe even weeks&#8212;I don&#8217;t really know.&nbsp; That&#8217;s how it happened for months and months&#8212;the same thing over and over&#8212;beatings, feeding me piss and shit and antibiotics, diarrhea and vomiting, but mostly pain.&nbsp; I was beaten every night when they returned from work.&nbsp; I dreaded the weekends when it would last all day and all night.&nbsp; The worse the pain the more Rebecca wanted to fuck.&nbsp; I could never understand her perverse thoughts.
�She often teased me with her body&#8212;her breasts, her vagina, and her ass.&nbsp; Then she&#8217;d hit my testicles with the crop or her knee, or anything she had handy.&nbsp; She and Mark fucked in front of me on the same bed that I had used.&nbsp; Sometimes they did it four or five times a day, especially when they beat me almost to death.&nbsp; Then one day I was released and tied again into the bed.&nbsp; She put me to sleep and when I awoke, my breasts were bigger.&nbsp; A week later they used the cane on them.&nbsp; I think they just wanted a bigger target.
�After, I don&#8217;t really know how long, but I would say almost a year they brought me upstairs.&nbsp; I used the shower for the first time since this all started.&nbsp; There wasn&#8217;t any hot water for me, but I did get to use soap and shave my beard.&nbsp; They chained me to the bed frame forcing me to sleep on the floor and when they woke up in the night I was expected to take their piss and swallow it.&nbsp; Of course, if I missed a drop I&#8217;d get beaten, but I was beaten anyway so what did it matter?&nbsp; I&#8217;d say I spent almost six months sleeping on the floor.&nbsp; I was naked the entire time and I had no pillow or blanket.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes I was restrained in an impossible position like a hogtie so I could barely walk in the morning.&nbsp; Other times I was so cold I was afraid I&#8217;d freeze to death.
�They were really excited the final day.&nbsp; I was bound tightly in rope and handcuffs and gagged before they moved me to the van.&nbsp; There I was tied into place and Rebecca drove away.&nbsp; I was terrified; I was sure they were going to kill me.&nbsp; Instead, they went hunting for my replacement.&nbsp; I think they snatched him from a parking lot.&nbsp; I know that Mark jumped the kid and dragged him into the van where he was handcuffed and gagged first and then blindfolded.&nbsp; I could see that they were ecstatic with the prospect of a new slave to hurt.&nbsp; I weighed 200 pounds when all this started and I knew that I had lost a lot of weight.&nbsp; It was only a matter of time before I was either dead in the basement or killed out in some woods and dumped.
�That night they celebrated and, for some reason, they wanted me to serve them drinks in the bedroom.&nbsp; I guess they thought I was so weak that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to resist them.&nbsp; I probably served them at least a dozen drinks each and I made them really strong toward the latter part of the night.&nbsp; Rebecca made me lie on the bed so she could piss in my mouth.&nbsp; Then she pushed me off.&nbsp; I expected her or Mark to secure me to the bed, but he had passed out and I guess Rebecca did, too.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest you already know.�&nbsp; I excused myself to use the toilet.&nbsp; The medical staff was flushing out my system by feeding me gallons of fresh clean water every day and night.&nbsp; I was pissing almost every hour around the clock.
I was in the hospital for eight days when one of the doctors told me they had some ideas on how to get rid of the chastity cage.&nbsp; �We&#8217;ve spoken to the manufacturer.&nbsp; They were reluctant at first, but when the sheriff got involved they agreed to cooperate.&nbsp; We could drill out the two bolts.&nbsp; They&#8217;re not very long&#8212;less than a half inch each&#8212;so we think it could be done in about two hours.&nbsp; We&#8217;d have to use a special drill bit and a lot of oil to lubricate the drill.&nbsp; The other way would be to use the &#8216;jaws of life.&#8217;&nbsp; That&#8217;s the tool that firemen use to pry open car doors.&nbsp; They&#8217;ll be here in about half an hour.&nbsp; If it works&#8212;great; it&#8217;ll be faster and easier than the drilling.�
I was half asleep when the firemen walked into my room.&nbsp; They had a ton of equipment including a portable engine, the hydraulic hoses, and the cutter/spreader device officially known as the �jaws of life.�&nbsp; There was about three-eighths of an inch between the retaining ring and the ring of the actual cage.&nbsp; One of the doctors pulled my scrotum aside to make room for the jaws.&nbsp; Normally the jaws are sharp, but these had been covered with adhesive tape to protect me.
They were able to get the jaws in about a half inch which the fireman thought would be plenty.&nbsp; Once the engine was started the nurses opened my window and closed the door to keep the noise to a minimum and vent the fumes.&nbsp; The machine was turned on and immediately the parts of the cage moved apart.&nbsp; Wedges were placed between the two rings to ensure that the parts wouldn&#8217;t snap back into place should the jaws slip.&nbsp; Wedges in place, the jaws were moved even farther into the space.&nbsp; The firemen held the machine steady while the doctors carefully moved my balls through the space and out the rear of the restraining ring.&nbsp; Lubricant was poured between my cock and the tube.&nbsp; I was relieved a minute later when it slid off my tortured organ.&nbsp; I wept in the joy I felt as I thanked the firemen and physicians.&nbsp; Once the firemen had gone I asked the doctor about having my artificial breasts surgically removed.
�We know that&#8217;s a priority, but we have to wait until you&#8217;re in better health.&nbsp; Your wife was crazy to expose you to a surgery in those conditions and your state of health.�
�Let&#8217;s face it, doctor, she WAS crazy.&nbsp; Why else would she do those things to me?�
�I wish I had an answer,� he replied, �but I don&#8217;t.�&nbsp; He patted my shoulder and left.
The next day a reporter from a local TV station found her way past the nurses to my room.&nbsp; �Mr. Keller, may I have a word?&nbsp; I&#8217;m Jessica Fillmore from WXFI News.&nbsp; There&#8217;s been a ton of speculation and the police aren&#8217;t very forthcoming.&nbsp; May I ask you some questions?�
�You can ask, but I reserve the right not to answer.�
�Just like a lawyer; I see you haven&#8217;t lost your touch.&nbsp; How long were you a prisoner?�
�Near as I can tell, it was a little over eighteen months.�
�How was it that you couldn&#8217;t escape?�
�During almost all that time I was handcuffed behind my back and chained to a post in the basement or my arms were in an arm binder.&nbsp; Do you know what that is?�
�Yes, I had to look it up online.&nbsp; Wasn&#8217;t that painful?�
�Not as painful as being beaten for hours every night with a whip or cane or riding crop, or any of the other things they used.�
�I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t mean to be insensitive.&nbsp; What other things did they use?&nbsp; It&#8217;s hard to imagine anything worse than a whip.�
�Next time you&#8217;re in Home Depot buy one of those driveway reflectors, the kind that are mounted on a piece of vinyl covered steel wire.&nbsp; Then imagine being hit with that on every part of your body for a couple of hours, stopping only when they couldn&#8217;t swing it any longer.&nbsp; After that you&#8217;ll welcome the whip, believe me.�
The interview went on for almost a half hour, covering virtually every topic, including my tits, my diet, and did I really think they would have killed me.&nbsp; It ended when a nurse walked in and threatened to call security.
About a month after my escape I had another visitor I had been expecting for some time&#8212;one of my law partners.&nbsp; He was very cordial, but I knew immediately what was on his mind&#8212;he didn&#8217;t want me to return to work.&nbsp; I had paid more than $200,000 in partner&#8217;s equity so I had every right to go back.&nbsp; I might understand if I had broken the law, but I was pretty sure this would come out as justifiable homicide.&nbsp; Eventually, he got to the point.&nbsp; �The firm is concerned about negative publicity.&nbsp; We will accept your letter of resignation effective immediately.�&nbsp; I almost leapt out of the bed to strangle this asshole.
�First of all, a lot of people out there think of me as some kind of hero.&nbsp; That would be good publicity, wouldn&#8217;t it?&nbsp; And then there&#8217;s the matter of my equity in the firm.&nbsp; After all I&#8217;ve been through do you think I can be intimidated by a dickweed like you?�
�I&#8217;m reasonably confident some accommodation can be made in regard to your equity&#8212;like about fifty percent back.�
�You know something, Albert?&nbsp; You&#8217;re an even bigger asshole than I ever imagined.&nbsp;&nbsp; Take your fifty percent and shove it.&nbsp; Come back when you&#8217;re authorized to spend more than a million.&nbsp; Otherwise, expect me back in the same office I left as soon as I am ready.&nbsp; Now get your sorry ass out of here.�&nbsp; He was red-faced and furious when he stomped out the door.&nbsp; He almost knocked over the police inspector who was on his way in.
�I think I have some good news for you.&nbsp; Did you know your wife kept a diary?&nbsp; She detailed every single episode in the goriest detail.&nbsp; I wanted to puke when I read some of it.&nbsp; Also we learned that Mark was actually Dr. Mark Stephens, a psychiatrist.&nbsp; We got a warrant to search his office and home.&nbsp; It seems you were an experiment in the beginning, but things got out of hand and there was no way they could let you go.&nbsp; DNA tests prove that they handled all the weapons and we found plenty of your DNA and blood on the business ends.&nbsp; The DA wants you to appear before the grand jury.&nbsp; Any idea when you can do it?�
�Any time would be fine, although I could use some clothes.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any other than this gown I&#8217;m in.�&nbsp; 
�Oh, yeah�the guys found this letter in your wife&#8217;s desk.&nbsp; It&#8217;s addressed to you.�
�Me?&nbsp; But why?&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t make any sense.�&nbsp; I took the letter and read it, �Dear Jonathan, It&#8217;s unlikely that you&#8217;ll ever read this, but I&#8217;m writing it anyway to get some things off my chest.&nbsp; I enjoyed being your wife, but not as much as I enjoyed hurting you and sex with Mark has been much better than it ever was with you.&nbsp; There is nothing like having that power over another person&#8212;the power of life and death.&nbsp; I know that I have been cruel to you, incredibly cruel.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry to tell you that I loved every minute, although there have been times I wished it was somebody else.&nbsp; Unfortunately for you, Mark feels that it had to be you in order for me and us to have the ultimate master/slave experience.&nbsp; 
�Soon we will find a replacement for you.&nbsp; We can see that you are breaking down.&nbsp; To be honest I never thought you&#8217;d last this long.&nbsp; As a physician I know all the problems associated with ingesting feces.&nbsp; The antibiotics alone should have been enough to kill you long ago.&nbsp; When you go we&#8217;ll drive you out into the country and dump your wasted body.
�Incidentally, I reported you missing when we took control of your life.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll be legally dead in another six years, but if your body is found I&#8217;ll be the grieving widow.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t you think I look great in black?
�I look forward to having another body to destroy, but it won&#8217;t be the same as destroying you.&nbsp; Maybe we&#8217;ll see each other on the other side, but I doubt it.&nbsp; If there really was a God there wouldn&#8217;t be people like me or Mark.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rebecca&nbsp; (You notice I didn&#8217;t sign it &#8216;Love&#8217; because I don&#8217;t any more.&nbsp; I only love destroying you.)
In spite of everything there was a tear in my eye when I handed him the letter.&nbsp; �You keep it,� I told him.&nbsp; I want nothing to do with her&#8212;alive or dead.�&nbsp; He nodded and left.
Testifying before the grand jury was nothing like what I had imagined.&nbsp; As a lawyer I was familiar with the process which is to obtain an indictment against a defendant like me.&nbsp; It has been said that a good district attorney could get an indictment against anyone at any time.&nbsp; There is no defense attorney permitted so it&#8217;s strictly the DA&#8217;s show.
I was asked first of all about the shooting and why.&nbsp; I explained how I had been tortured on a daily basis, how I had been given breasts, and so forth.&nbsp; I was surprised&#8212;shocked actually&#8212;when the DA asked me to remove my shirt.&nbsp; Several members of the Grand Jury gasped when they saw my breasts.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m planning to have them removed as soon as I&#8217;m able,� I explained.
�What&#8217;s keeping you?�
�My body is a mess from what they forced me to eat and drink&#8212;their feces and urine.&nbsp; The doctors also want me to gain some weight so I&#8217;ll be stronger.&nbsp; If I had it now there&#8217;s a good chance it would kill me.�
�May we please see your back?�
I turned around, expecting a strong reaction and I wasn&#8217;t disappointed.&nbsp; Several women actually fainted.&nbsp; The DA thanked me for my testimony and I was taken back to the hospital.&nbsp; I learned a week later that the grand jury declined to indict.&nbsp; I was a free man.&nbsp; I took advantage of my freedom by telephoning my friend Martin Klein.
Marty and I had graduated from the same law school and accepted positions in the same firm.&nbsp; Truthfully, Marty was a much better lawyer than I was at the time, but I was elected as a partner and he wasn&#8217;t.&nbsp; He sued and won a discrimination suit based on religious discrimination and it turned out to be the best thing that had ever happened to him.&nbsp; He opened his own practice and had been a successful litigator ever since.&nbsp; We met in my hospital room and I told him what I had in mind.&nbsp; On my behalf he sued my deceased wife for malpractice&#8212;surgery without consent three times, unnecessary surgery, etc., etc. etc.&nbsp; I sued Dr. Mark Stephens for malpractice and his estate for compensatory and punitive damages.&nbsp; I also sued my former law firm for discrimination, breach of contract and a bunch of other charges, following the concept that if you throw enough shit against the wall some of it will stick.
It took a while&#8212;almost a year-- but eventually they all settled: my former law partners for 1.5 million; Rebecca&#8217;s insurance company for seven million, Stephens&#8217; insurance firm for five million, and his estate for one million.&nbsp; After all was said and done I had roughly 9.5 million dollars and Marty had almost half that.&nbsp; I could retire if I wished, but I chose to join Marty as a junior partner.&nbsp; I could afford to pick and choose my clients, something few attorneys can do.
My breasts were surgically removed after I had been in the hospital for a month.&nbsp; My body had mostly recovered and I had gained thirty pounds.&nbsp; The hardest part of the recovery had to do with my digestive system.&nbsp; After eating nothing but feces for so long I had trouble adjusting to real food.&nbsp; I was given an exercise regimen along with a high protein diet to help me restore my muscles.&nbsp; I left the hospital after being there for sixty days.&nbsp; Marty picked me up and drove me home.&nbsp; He had taken the initiative to remove all the sheetrock and floors of the bedroom and replace them.&nbsp; All the bedroom furniture was replaced, too.&nbsp; He paid for everything knowing that I would repay the debt once I had returned to work or when my lawsuits had been settled.&nbsp; In spite of all he had done I found I couldn&#8217;t stay there.&nbsp; There 
were too many memories and they were all bad.&nbsp; I put the house up for sale and moved into a small apartment.
I was forty years old and all alone.&nbsp; Many of my former friends shunned me as though I was at fault for what had happened to me.&nbsp; Maybe they weren&#8217;t sure what to say to me or how to act in my presence.&nbsp; Surprisingly, I wasn&#8217;t resentful&#8212;I was relieved.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t want to be reminded of my wife or of my experiences under her foot.&nbsp; I deliberately moved to another part of the city where I was mostly unknown.&nbsp; As I gained weight my appearance changed so few recognized me as the scrawny scarecrow in my hospital photos.&nbsp; I joined a new gym, but I was always careful to keep my shirt on.&nbsp; I had a special shirt to wear in the pool and if I had to change I did it in a stall in the bathroom.
I was there on a Wednesday evening and was about to change when an attractive young woman approached me.&nbsp; �Excuse me; I don&#8217;t mean to be rude, but are you�?�
�I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; Who do you think I am?�
�Are you�that torture guy?�
�You&#8217;re very perceptive.&nbsp; Few people recognize me now that I&#8217;m a bit heavier.&nbsp; It&#8217;s what happens when you eat real food.�
�Oh, I am sorry.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t mean to bring back those memories.�
�Don&#8217;t worry--those memories will always be with me.&nbsp; Now, if you&#8217;ll excuse me I need to change into my swimming shirt.&nbsp; If I do it at the pool�well, it won&#8217;t be pleasant.�
�I read about that.&nbsp; Does it still bother you?�
�Only twenty-four hours a day.&nbsp; I have a lotion to put on it, but there are plenty of spots I can&#8217;t reach.&nbsp; It generally hurts like hell.�
�I&#8217;ll do it for you�if you like.�
�That&#8217;s a kind offer, but it&#8217;ll probably make you sick.&nbsp; When I testified before the grand jury two women fainted when they saw it.&nbsp; You seem to be a nice woman; I wouldn&#8217;t want to upset you.�
�Ha�don&#8217;t worry about me.&nbsp; I&#8217;m a social worker; I&#8217;ve seen plenty of ugliness.�
�I&#8217;m sure you have, but it&#8217;s not the same.&nbsp; Your people look normal, but they&#8217;re fucked up inside.&nbsp; My body is fucked up, period.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no hiding it.�
�Well�all the same, I&#8217;d like to help you.�
�Tell you what, I need to swim.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re still around when I&#8217;m done how about joining me for a cup of coffee and a piece of pie at the diner around the corner?�
�Okay�you&#8217;re on.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll be here on one of the bikes.�&nbsp; I nodded and smiled for the first time in�I realized it would be almost two years.&nbsp; My swim was great.&nbsp; It was part of a physical therapy program for my back and my skin.&nbsp; My muscles needed the exercise and my skin needed to stretch, otherwise the scars would shrink and my mobility will be threatened.&nbsp; I returned to the gym and looked around.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t sure if I could even recognize the woman.&nbsp; Then I heard a noise behind me.&nbsp; I turned and there she was.
She spoke first, �I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t scare you away.&nbsp; I tend to be a bit forward at times.&nbsp; I&#8217;m almost ready.&nbsp; Do you want to shower?�
�Um�I can&#8217;t here.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll just change in the men&#8217;s room and be back out in ten, okay?�
�Sounds good; wait for me here?�&nbsp; I nodded and rushed to clean up.&nbsp; It&#8217;s kind of funny taking a shower while you&#8217;re wearing a shirt and bathing suit, so that&#8217;s why I showered at home.&nbsp; I toweled myself dry in the men&#8217;s room stall, dressed hurriedly, and walked out to find her waiting for me.&nbsp; We walked out and turned to the right; we were in the diner two minutes later.&nbsp; I ordered a cherry pie and coffee; she ordered blueberry and a cup of tea.&nbsp; Then there was silence.
�I&#8217;m sorry.&nbsp; My name is Jonathan.�
�I know.&nbsp; I&#8217;m the one who should apologize.&nbsp; I should have introduced myself back in the gym.&nbsp; Kerry Johanson.�
�Well, Kerry Johanson, social worker, what do you do when you&#8217;re not picking up lonesome torture victims?�&nbsp; She laughed and reached out to touch my hand.&nbsp; The ice was broken.&nbsp; We talked for more than an hour about everything and nothing.&nbsp; Finally, I paid the bill and we left.
�I was serious about the lotion, Jonathan.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll do your back.&nbsp; No�don&#8217;t turn away.&nbsp; You have to face it someday.&nbsp; Why not tonight?&nbsp; C&#8217;mon, I&#8217;ll follow you.�
�Don&#8217;t you have to go to work tomorrow?�
�Sure, but I get plenty of sleep.�&nbsp; She took my chin in her hand and looked into my eyes.&nbsp; She could see the tears forming as she reached up and kissed my cheek.&nbsp; A minute later I had agreed and we walked to our cars.&nbsp; I drove slowly, but it wasn&#8217;t necessary; I only lived a few blocks away.&nbsp; We took the elevator up and I opened the door.
�It&#8217;s not too late�you really don&#8217;t have to�.�&nbsp; She put her fingers to my lips then kissed me gently.&nbsp; She led me into my own apartment.
�Geez, Jonathan, don&#8217;t you have any furniture?�
�Yeah, I have a bedroom set and a TV.&nbsp; That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve needed.�
�I think you need a couch and maybe a chair�a table, even.&nbsp; How do you eat?�
�I usually go out.&nbsp; I eat at the diner a lot.&nbsp; I plan to go back to work soon, although &#8216;back&#8217; probably isn&#8217;t the right term to use.&nbsp; I&#8217;m suing my former law firm and going to work with a friend who has his own practice.&nbsp; I think I&#8217;ll need some clothes, too.&nbsp; I haven&#8217;t worn any for�.�&nbsp; I broke down and cried as the memories came flooding back.&nbsp; She held me close, carefully avoiding putting her hands on my back, for several minutes.&nbsp; I stopped long enough to tell her, �I&#8217;m sorry.�
�For what�being human?&nbsp; Believe me, Jonathan you have nothing to be sorry for.&nbsp; You are a survivor.&nbsp; You should be proud of yourself.�
�Is that what they teach you in social worker school?�
�No, Jonathan that&#8217;s what I learned in human being school.�&nbsp; I felt so ashamed.&nbsp; I had repaid her kindness with cutting sarcasm.&nbsp; I tried to apologize, but she wouldn&#8217;t listen.&nbsp; She sat me on the bed and unbuttoned my shirt.&nbsp;&nbsp; �Where&#8217;s the lotion?�
�In the bathroom, on the toilet.�&nbsp; She rose and walked out, returning a minute or so later.
�Okay, go in and take your shower I&#8217;ll wait here for you.�&nbsp; I walked back ten minutes later wearing only a pair of gym shorts.&nbsp; I sat on the bed while she read the instructions on the label.&nbsp; �Turn around and roll over; it&#8217;s time we both face your demon.�&nbsp; I did and she gasped, �Well, it&#8217;s a shock, that&#8217;s for sure.&nbsp; Damn, the surface is rough.&nbsp; Is that from the scar tissue?�
�Yeah, I have scars on top of my scars and scars on top of them.&nbsp; I&#8217;m thinking about plastic surgery.�&nbsp; She began to rub the lotion in.&nbsp; �That feels good, thanks.&nbsp; Do you feel like throwing up in the bathroom?&nbsp; You must be revolted.�
�No, I don&#8217;t and I&#8217;m not.&nbsp; What&#8217;s this stuff supposed to do?�
�It&#8217;s supposed to soften the scars and flatten them.�
�Hmmm, how often have you done this?�
�Tonight&#8217;s the first time.&nbsp; My arms don&#8217;t work right yet.&nbsp; I can barely reach my back.�
�It says here �Apply morning and evening.&nbsp; How are you going to do it tomorrow morning?�
�I�I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; I guess I&#8217;m not.�
�I&#8217;m almost done.&nbsp; Stay like this for a while.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll be right back.&nbsp; Leave the door unlocked so I can come back in.�&nbsp; She got up and left.&nbsp; I stayed on my stomach for almost a half hour.&nbsp; Her hands had been like magic on my rough broken skin.&nbsp; I was about to get up when I heard the door.&nbsp; Kerry walked in with a pile of clothes.&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t get up.&nbsp; At least you have some bedroom furniture.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll put my stuff in these drawers.�
�What are you doing?�
�Every man&#8217;s dream&#8212;I&#8217;m spending the night.&nbsp; You need to have this medicine and you have nobody to do it.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not having sex.&nbsp; I insist on at least one date before that, but I will hold you and�we&#8217;ll see.�&nbsp; She leaned over and kissed the back of my head.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t help myself.&nbsp; It had been so long since I had felt the affection of a woman and I thought I never would again.&nbsp; I cried like a baby.&nbsp; She rolled me onto my side and held me, caressing my face and head.&nbsp; I wrapped my arms around her and raised my head.&nbsp; We looked into each other&#8217;s eyes for almost a minute then, by silent agreement, moved forward for a long searing kiss.&nbsp; It was wonderful&#8212;no--it was incredible.&nbsp; Her lips were so plump and soft, her tongue insistent and demanding.
She broke it after a minute.&nbsp; �I need a shower.&nbsp; Are there towels in the bathroom?�
�In the closet; help yourself.�&nbsp; She jumped up and left; I found a T-shirt, put it on and got into bed, turning on the TV while I waited.&nbsp; She returned a few minutes later wearing what appeared to be a long Angry Birds T-shirt.&nbsp; I had to laugh.&nbsp; �You weren&#8217;t kidding when you said no sex, were you?�
�I don&#8217;t know, this is one of my sexiest outfits.�&nbsp; We both had a good laugh at that.&nbsp; She snuggled up close to me and I handed her the remote.
�If you continue to rub against me like that I&#8217;m going to have an extremely embarrassing reaction.�&nbsp; I could already feel my cock harden&#8212;so could she.
�How long has it been?�
�Not since before I was taken prisoner.�&nbsp; I paused before continuing, �Just over twenty months, I think.�
�That&#8217;s terrible.&nbsp; Haven&#8217;t you masturbated since you were released from that device?�
�No, I&#8217;ve tried, but my arms are still pretty useless and every time I try I remember everything and lose my erection.&nbsp; You should just go home&#8212;I&#8217;m such a loser.�
�I think I get to decide that on my own,� she said as she got up from the bed.&nbsp; She opened her purse and removed a condom.&nbsp; �I always have to be prepared.&nbsp; You&#8217;d be amazed at how many of these things I&#8217;ve given away.�&nbsp; She sat by my side and reached into my shorts for my cock.&nbsp; Her touch was amazing&#8212;gentle, but demanding.&nbsp; She stroked me to hardness in nothing flat.&nbsp; Pulling my cock out the leg of my shorts, she continued to stroke me, but stopped for a second or two to run the condom down my shaft.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re going to cum buckets, I think.&nbsp; It&#8217;s late and I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll want to change the whole bed.�&nbsp; Now she kneeled, her legs apart as she stroked me harder and faster.&nbsp; &#8216;Jonathan, give me your hand.�&nbsp; I did and she placed it on her pussy.
My fingers touched her; she was wet and her labia were swollen.&nbsp; I explored her pussy&#8212;outside and in.&nbsp; Her hand was like a vise that ravaged my organ.&nbsp; She stroked furiously until my body became rigid and I exploded over and over into the condom.&nbsp; I had never cum like that and I doubted I ever would again.&nbsp; Seventeen times I blew hot slick semen into that condom; it went on and on and on.&nbsp; Only her tight grip prevented it from leaking out onto my abdomen and the bed.&nbsp; She held me as she removed my fingers from between her legs.&nbsp; My fingers were brought to my mouth.&nbsp; I opened obediently and sucked them clean.&nbsp; I had never felt so much at peace.&nbsp; My eyes closed as she removed the condom from my cock.&nbsp; I felt a warm washcloth on my organ, then nothing.
I woke disoriented in the middle of the night, feeling her body against mine.&nbsp; I panicked for a second until she spoke calmly, �Relax Jonathan, it&#8217;s only me&#8212;Kerry.�&nbsp; She rubbed my cheek and kissed it several times.&nbsp; �Go back to sleep.&nbsp; That&#8217;s it.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll see you in the morning.�&nbsp; She kissed me again and brought her body into closer proximity to mine.
We woke to the alarm clock in the morning.&nbsp; She showered while I shaved and then I showered.&nbsp; There was no reason for my modesty&#8212;she had already seen my ruined back and my cock and balls, too.&nbsp; She led me back to the bedroom where she applied the lotion again.&nbsp; I was lying there enjoying the sensation of her hands on my back when I asked her, �Kerry�why?�
�You mean why am I here, why am I doing your back, why did I jerk you off last night?&nbsp; I&#8217;ll tell you.&nbsp; I recognized you the very first night you came to the gym and I&#8217;ve seen you quite a few times since then.&nbsp; Jonathan, I have never seen someone who looked so sad or so lonely in my life.&nbsp; Believe me when I tell you that I see sadness and ruined lives every day.&nbsp; But I had never seen anyone in as bad condition as you were.&nbsp; I like to help people and I find that I like you.&nbsp; Good enough?�
�I guess, but what&#8217;s going to happen now?�
�What do you want to happen?&nbsp; Want me to come back tonight?&nbsp; Want to take me out to dinner, maybe to a movie or a club after?&nbsp; Want me to stay again tonight?&nbsp; What do you want?�
�All of those things?�&nbsp; She laughed and I joined her.&nbsp; She leaned down to kiss my cheek.
She finished my back and stepped off the bed.&nbsp; �Can I get some privacy to dress?&nbsp; Please?�
�I grinned, �I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; What&#8217;s in it for me?�
�A knee in the balls if you don&#8217;t get out of here.�
�Ouch!&nbsp; What happened to that sweet helpful woman who was just here?�
�I&#8217;m her evil twin.&nbsp; Now, please Jonathan.�
�Of course.&nbsp; I can make some coffee or tea, if you prefer.�
�Coffee will be great.&nbsp; Do you have any milk?�
�Yeah, I actually do have some food and drink here.&nbsp; I just don&#8217;t like to cook for only me.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why I go out a lot.�&nbsp; I walked out and closed the door behind me.&nbsp; My back felt a lot better�and so did I.&nbsp; I made the coffee and poured the milk into a small pitcher.&nbsp; She was impressed with my culinary skills.&nbsp; �Where would you like to go for dinner?�
�I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; You&#8217;re not working so can you afford it?�
�As a matter of fact, I can.&nbsp; Rebecca had a life insurance policy and I guess she forgot to change the beneficiary.&nbsp; Once I was cleared by the police the insurance company had to pay off.&nbsp; I have more than enough.&nbsp; I also expect the malpractice insurance companies to settle pretty quickly.&nbsp; If they don&#8217;t we&#8217;ll use the media to crucify them.&nbsp; We know that and so do they.&nbsp; We have nothing to lose; they have everything.&nbsp; Imagine what public opinion would be if they were seen to be picking on the torture victim.&nbsp; I could put on my forlorn face and you could testify as to what a loser I am.�&nbsp; She reached out to �punch� my arm.
�Any suggestions as to dinner, then?�
�No, why don&#8217;t you pick someplace?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know many restaurants in this part of the city.&nbsp; Could you make the reservation?�
�You ARE taking me to dinner, aren&#8217;t you?�
�Yes, of course; I just thought it might be easier this way.�
�Not to worry; I was just teasing you.&nbsp; It&#8217;s so good to see that you still have a sense of humor.&nbsp; Seven okay with you?�
�Sure, that sounds great.�&nbsp; She kissed my cheek and off to work she went.&nbsp; I checked in with Marty and agreed to work the following Wednesday.&nbsp; I needed a few suits and other clothes and now I was sure I could get Kerry to help me.&nbsp; I was amazed at what difference a day could make.
She returned to my apartment just after five.&nbsp; I was wearing my best slacks and a golf shirt.&nbsp; She asked about my back; I told her it hadn&#8217;t felt this good in ages.&nbsp; She changed her clothes and I drove away.&nbsp; She directed me out of the city to a steak house in a neighboring suburb.&nbsp; It was crowded.&nbsp; I was glad we had a reservation.&nbsp; We were placed at a nice table near the rear of the building where we looked out over a dimly lit meadow.&nbsp; It was supposed to be romantic and I supposed it was.&nbsp; I noticed a few people looking at us as we walked to the table, but I assumed they were looking at Kerry who was much younger and a hell of a lot better looking than I was.
My first surprise came when a bottle of wine was delivered to our table.&nbsp; �I didn&#8217;t order any wine,� I told the waiter.
�Yes, sir, it is a gift from one of the patrons.�&nbsp; Kerry smiled, but I was confused.
�Just take it, Jonathan.&nbsp; Not everyone in this world is cruel.&nbsp; There are more who are kind and considerate.�&nbsp; I shrugged my shoulders and nodded my acceptance.&nbsp; I could hear a buzz from the other diners as we drank and ate&#8212;the best meal I&#8217;d had in almost two years.&nbsp; Once we had finished I asked the waiter for the check.
�It has been taken care of, sir.�
�What do you mean?�
�One of the other patrons has paid for your meal.&nbsp; He said it was a privilege, and, if I may, I agree.&nbsp; It has been a pleasure to serve you.�&nbsp; When I tried to leave a tip it was refused.&nbsp; I held the chair for Kerry and she led me out.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t believe my eyes when people stood and applauded.&nbsp; I took Kerry&#8217;s hand.&nbsp; I could hardly see for the tears in my eyes.&nbsp; I spoke to her once we were in the parking lot.
�What was that all about?&nbsp; Do you know?�
�I had nothing to do with it, Jonathan.&nbsp; I suspect you were recognized.&nbsp; That was why I put the reservation in my name.&nbsp; I hope you weren&#8217;t embarrassed.�
�Not embarrassed�a little overwhelmed, though.&nbsp; Can we go back to the apartment?&nbsp; My back is really killing me.�&nbsp; She agreed and fifteen minutes later I was disrobing in my bedroom.&nbsp; I lay across the bed clad only in my boxers.&nbsp; I looked up surprised to find Kerry wearing only a matching black bra and bikini panties.&nbsp; I hadn&#8217;t realized what an amazing body she had.&nbsp; Obviously, I knew that she worked out, but lots of overweight fat slobs also worked out.&nbsp; Kerry was toned.&nbsp; Her abs were amazing and her breasts were incredible.
�I&#8217;ll be happy to work on your back anytime your eyes go back into your head,� she joked as she spanked my butt.&nbsp; I grunted in pain.&nbsp; �Oh, Jonathan, did I hurt you?�
�Only a little; my butt was their second favorite target.�
�Let me see.�&nbsp; I gave her an incredulous look.&nbsp; She raised her eyebrows and crossed her arms.&nbsp; �Jonathan, I&#8217;ve seen your penis.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve seen your testicles.&nbsp; What else is there?&nbsp; Drop &#8216;em so I can see.�&nbsp; I pushed up weakly and sat at the bed&#8217;s edge.&nbsp; She motioned me up, stuck her thumbs in the waistband and pulled them down.&nbsp; �Okay, on your stomach.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll deal with this thing later.�&nbsp; She kissed me, on the lips this time, and pushed me down.
�Damn, Jonathan, is there any part of your body that isn&#8217;t scarred?�
 �Yeah, my penis�thank God it was locked up or it would probably be gone by now.�
�Yes, she could have actually done you a favor.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll find out how big in a little while.�
�Do you always talk in code?�
�No, never&#8212;I&#8217;m planning to fuck you in about a half hour so shut up and let me do your back and ass.�&nbsp; I made a motion to zip my lips and rolled quickly onto my stomach.&nbsp; I felt Kerry&#8217;s wonderful hands go to work.&nbsp; Using both hands she massaged my back, soothing both my skin and my muscles.&nbsp; Then she moved down to my butt.&nbsp; I relaxed as her hands did their magic. She lay beside me once she was done.&nbsp; �Are you going to be able to lie on your back for a while?�
�I think so.&nbsp; Are we really going to�?�
�Sure, I told you�at least one formal date and you barely qualify after dinner tonight even though I picked the restaurant, made the reservation, and you didn&#8217;t have to pay.&nbsp; On the positive side�you did drive both ways and you would have paid if you hadn&#8217;t been treated.&nbsp; Let me feel your back.&nbsp; Okay, it&#8217;s dry so�I want to wash my hands.&nbsp; Why don&#8217;t you turn down the lights?&nbsp; I still have some condoms in my purse.�&nbsp; She went out to the bathroom; I did as instructed and turned down the lights.&nbsp; I rolled onto my back totally naked and waited.
Kerry walked back in five minutes later.&nbsp; Maybe slinked would have been more accurate.&nbsp; She moved like a cat.&nbsp; I felt like the mouse.&nbsp; She leaned over me, moved her hand behind her bra and unclasped it.&nbsp; It fell forward onto the bed baring her beautiful symmetrical breasts with the small dark areolas and nipples.&nbsp; I moved up to suckle, but she teased me.&nbsp; �Patience,� she whispered.&nbsp; Her thumbs hooked into her waistband and in seconds they were on the floor.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t take my eyes off her neatly trimmed pussy.&nbsp; Her labia were swollen.&nbsp; I pulled her down onto my body and reached up, my mouth meeting hers.&nbsp; Our tongues wrapped around each other as we writhed together, rolling over the bed.&nbsp; I reached between her legs&#8212;she was moist and eager.&nbsp; My finger entered her; she groaned in response and her tongue pushed into my mouth, her lips crushed mine.&nbsp; I felt her hand wrap around my cock&#8212;it was my turn to moan.&nbsp; She moved down to rub her clit up and down my shaft.&nbsp; I was ready�oh God, was I ready!&nbsp; She lifted her hips to roll the condom down my shaft.&nbsp; When she dropped them my cock disappeared into her body.&nbsp; We moved together like two well acquainted lovers even though we were tyros&#8212;newcomers to each other.&nbsp; It was yet another miracle that I could even remember how to do it.
Kerry held my shoulders as her breasts moved in rhythm with her body, swaying with each thrust.&nbsp; My hands found her flared hips as I pulled myself even deeper into her.&nbsp; Had we done this last night I would have lasted fewer than five seconds, but now I felt I could keep pace with her for several minutes, at least.&nbsp; 
She spoke first, �You feel wonderful, Jonathan.&nbsp; I&#8217;m tingling all over.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to have the most delicious orgasm�very soon.�&nbsp; I smiled in return.&nbsp; �Funny,� I thought, �before we met I never thought I&#8217;d smile again.�&nbsp; Her pace changed&#8212;faster, harder.&nbsp; I joined her every thrust.&nbsp; She threw her head back.&nbsp; Her mouth formed a perfect �O� as it hit.&nbsp; I continued pumping her for several seconds until I could feel the sweet delirium of my orgasm as I jetted several long thick ropes of semen into the condom.&nbsp; I was exhausted and so was she; she collapsed onto my chest.&nbsp; I wrapped my arms around her, moved my lips to hers and we kissed.&nbsp; It was the kiss of satisfied lovers&#8212;slow and unhurried as though we had all night.&nbsp; My flaccid penis fell from her tunnel, the condom hanging loosely, half-filled with my seed.&nbsp; We fell asleep quickly.
We went out to breakfast the following morning&#8212;Saturday.&nbsp; I bought two suits knowing that they would likely last for two months at the most.&nbsp; I was putting back the weight I had lost quickly.&nbsp; I needed the gym to make sure it was muscle, not fat.&nbsp; Kerry came with me every evening, often joining me in the pool.&nbsp; I enjoyed having her accompany me on my laps&#8212;swimming can be so solitary.
Kerry stayed with me as the days became weeks, the weeks months.&nbsp; I had returned to work and was into my first trial, the matter of a young Hispanic woman who had been tricked into working for a wealthy family for nothing, making her a virtual slave.&nbsp; Like me she had been held captive for well more than a year when the pool man at a neighbor&#8217;s home saw her waving frantically, holding a sign, �HELP.�&nbsp; He called the police after seeing the woman beaten by the homeowner.&nbsp; Enter me&#8212;super-lawyer and expert on being held captive.&nbsp; I walked confidently into the courtroom.
�It&#8217;s a pleasure to see you back in court, Mr. Keller.�
�Thank you, your honor.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a pleasure to be here, I assure you.�&nbsp; Then I went to war.&nbsp; I held nothing back, coming close to misconduct several times.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t keep my personal emotions out of the case.&nbsp; I returned to my seat, but stopped halfway.&nbsp; I saw Kerry in the gallery.&nbsp; She smiled, waved, and blushed from self-consciousness.&nbsp; I returned to work.&nbsp; We were in our third day when opposing counsel asked for a chat.&nbsp; I was beating him senseless and they were on their way to a huge loss.&nbsp; He offered my client $50,000; I looked at him as if he was crazy.&nbsp; �Listen carefully and take this back to your client.&nbsp; I&#8217;m beating the pants off of you and I&#8217;m going to get punitive damages in addition to compensatory.&nbsp; As you know, there&#8217;s no limit to punitive damages.&nbsp; Your client is up against it.&nbsp; I&#8217;m seeing at least a million, if not more.&nbsp; Now, if we were offered a million I&#8217;d ask my client to consider, but 50K?&nbsp; Forget it.�&nbsp; They folded the following morning; my client would get $650,000; I&#8217;d get $350,000.&nbsp; Not too shabby for three weeks work.&nbsp; My agreement with Marty called for him to get twenty percent, but I was still more than satisfied.&nbsp; Success built my first career; success would build this one.
Kerry and I had never really discussed her moving in.&nbsp; It just happened.&nbsp; We closed out her apartment one weekend and moved everything of value into mine.&nbsp; We were together four months and were really getting serious when she came home from work one evening, head down, tears in her eyes.&nbsp; �Jonathan, I�I have to�tell�tell you something.�&nbsp; It was time.&nbsp; I had known she was carrying a dark secret for months; I was only waiting for her to tell me about it.
�Okay, come over here and sit next to me.�&nbsp; I patted the couch, encouraging her to sit.
�No�you&#8217;re going to hate me.�
�I don&#8217;t think so.&nbsp; In fact, I&#8217;ll probably love you even more.�&nbsp; She looked at me and bawled.&nbsp; She cried so hard she was shaking.
�I �I�I lied to you�about when we met.�
�I know, Kerry.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve always known.&nbsp; You&#8217;re Mark Stephens&#8217; sister.�
�But�how?�
I got up and walked to my desk.&nbsp; I pulled out Rebecca&#8217;s diary.&nbsp; �The police returned this to me once the case was closed.&nbsp; It&#8217;s Rebecca&#8217;s diary.&nbsp; You should read it.&nbsp; A publisher wants to make a book out of it.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a photo inside&#8212;Rebecca, Mark, and you.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a caption on the other side and, see the date?&nbsp; She was supposed to be in Salt Lake City at a conference.&nbsp; This hotel is in Hawaii.&nbsp; Kerry, I&#8217;ve always known.&nbsp; I recognized you in the gym several weeks before you approached me.�
�(Sob) That&#8217;s not all.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll really hate me now.�&nbsp; She got up and went into the closet, opening a box of her belongings.&nbsp; �Know what this is?�
�Yeah, I do&#8212;water.�
�No, it&#8217;s poison; I was going to poison you.�
�Why didn&#8217;t you?�
�When we first met I wanted to kill you.&nbsp; I was sure you had murdered Mark.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t believe that he&#8217;d done all those things to you.&nbsp; I was sure you were lying.&nbsp; Then I saw your body and I had some doubts.&nbsp; Then I got to know you and I realized you&#8217;d never lie about that.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t know what to do.�
I put my arm around her and pulled her to me.&nbsp; �I knew who you were and one day while you were out shopping I was looking for something in the closet.&nbsp; That&#8217;s when I found the bottle.&nbsp; It&#8217;s marked &#8216;Poison&#8217; so I had a pretty good idea why it was here.&nbsp; I emptied it down the sink, rinsed the bottle, and refilled it with water.&nbsp; If I were in your position I probably would have done the same thing, except I wouldn&#8217;t use poison.&nbsp; I&#8217;d use something more violent.&nbsp; You had it, but you never used it so, as far as I&#8217;m concerned, it&#8217;s a non-issue.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t hate you.&nbsp; In fact, I&#8217;m in love with you.&nbsp; I have been for a while.&nbsp; You&#8217;re the best person I&#8217;ve ever met.�
�I guess I haven&#8217;t hidden my feelings for you, have I?&nbsp; I was prepared to hate you, but I can&#8217;t.&nbsp; Oh, Jonathan, I hate myself for what I wanted to do.�
�Don&#8217;t�you&#8217;re only human.&nbsp; You didn&#8217;t know me then.&nbsp; You had a right to be concerned.&nbsp; So, here&#8217;s what I think we should do.&nbsp; Tomorrow morning we should get a marriage license.&nbsp; Then we could go up into the mountains for a week and get married at some little Justice of the Peace.&nbsp; Then we can fuck ourselves silly and maybe make a little Kerry.�
�Or a Jonathan?�&nbsp; I cringed.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll accept on one condition.�&nbsp; I really cringed at her demand, but the following evening we went to the gym.&nbsp; I changed into my swim trunks and a sweat shirt in the locker room for the first time before walking to the pool.&nbsp; Kerry squeezed my hand to reassure me.&nbsp; I steeled myself as I removed my shirt and stood at the pool&#8217;s edge for a minute waiting for the reaction.&nbsp; Kerry removed her shirt and shorts, joining me in her bikini.&nbsp; We held hands and jumped into the pool.&nbsp; My back was exposed in public for the first time.&nbsp; Nobody reacted; there were no screams and nobody fainted.&nbsp; I was finally free.&nbsp; We set off together down the pool.
Kerry did read the diary.&nbsp; I sat with her to console and support her as she cried at every page.&nbsp; Learning what a monster her brother had become was really tough on her, but I needed her input.&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t allow the book to be published without her knowledge and permission.&nbsp; I knew it would destroy what little reputation he had remaining.&nbsp; In the end it was Kerry, not me, who made the decision.&nbsp; We wrote the post-torture epilog together.&nbsp; When we signed the contract we agreed to donate the proceeds to a shelter for battered women.&nbsp; I felt good knowing that something worthwhile would come from all the pain and misery I had endured.
About two weeks later we drove up into the mountains for a week&#8217;s vacation.&nbsp; Marriage license in hand we walked into the Justice&#8217;s parlor.&nbsp; His wife and clerk were our witnesses.&nbsp; Five minutes later we were man and wife.&nbsp; I&#8217;d gone through hell and survived; now I was looking forward to a little bit of heaven.&nbsp; I was pretty sure I&#8217;d find it with Kerry.
