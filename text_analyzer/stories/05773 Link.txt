    Homo erectus 
   
    H. erectus existed
    between 1.8 million and 300,000 years ago. Like habilis,
    the face has protruding jaws with large molars, no chin, thick brow ridges,
    and a long low skull, with a brain size varying between 750 and 1225 cc.
    Early erectus specimens average about 900 cc, while late ones have
    an average of about 1100 cc (Leakey 1994). The skeleton is more robust than
    those of modern humans, implying greater strength. Body proportions vary;
    the Turkana Boy is tall and slender (though still
    extraordinarily strong), like modern humans from the same area, while the
    few limb bones found of Peking Man
    indicate a shorter, sturdier build. Study of the Turkana
    Boy skeleton indicates that erectus may have been more efficient at
    walking than modern humans, whose skeletons have had to adapt to allow for
    the birth of larger-brained infants (Willis 1989). Homo habilis and all the australopithecines are found
    only in Africa, but erectus was wide-ranging, and has been found in
    Africa, Asia, and Europe. There is evidence that erectus
    probably used fire, and their stone tools are more
    sophisticated than those of habilis.

    Homo
    sapiens (archaic) (also Homo heidelbergensis)
    
   
    Archaic forms of Homo sapiens first appear about 500,000
    years ago. The term covers a diverse group of skulls which have features of
    both Homo erectus and modern humans. The brain size is larger than erectus
    and smaller than most modern humans, averaging about 1200 cc, and the skull
    is more rounded than in erectus. The skeleton and teeth are usually
    less robust than erectus, but more robust than modern humans. Many still
    have large brow ridges and receding foreheads and chins. There is no clear
    dividing line between late erectus and archaic sapiens, and
    many fossils between 500,000 and 200,000 years ago are difficult to
    classify as one or the other.

South Africa 2012

&nbsp;

Dr
Bartlett scratched his head for the seventh time in as many minutes as he
peered over the shoulder of the archaeologist who was carefully cleaning the
sand stone of debris and sand to reveal the footprint.� It was the fourth one that they had found
and, judging by the indentations in the rock before him there where at least� a dozen
more.� 

&nbsp;

The
first footprint had been found, as most great discoveries seem to, by a small
boy tending to his flock of goats.� One
of his charges had wandered off and, as the boy had followed, he had literally
stumbled over the imprint, which must have been uncovered, by the recent heavy
rains.� The boy had told the village
elders about the strange footprint.�
Fortunately word of the footprint had reached his university and a small
team, led by him, had been dispatched to investigate.

&nbsp;

Dr
Bartlett stood up from his bent position and stretched as he took in the arid
landscape.� Although hot, it was far from
a desert.� Lush grass and the occasional
tree stretched out towards the horizon in a series of rolling hills.� It had not always been so.� The spot where he was standing had once been
the bank of a twisting river.� The
climate had been wetter at the time these footprints had been made and most of
the southern continent had been covered in dense jungle. Even the Sahara desert
had once been a fertile grassy plain, with occasional woodland and this
environment had supported a variety of Apes, many species were long dead.� Climatic change had forced extinction on the
less adaptable.� These rich and fertile
forests had given rise to a great variety of apes and hominids until eventually
modern man was born.� 

&nbsp;

Dr Bartletts� thoughts had run a full circle and his eyes
again returned to the footprints.� They
were definitely human.� They would have
stood about five foot six inches tall, judging by the length of the stride.� From what had been uncovered so far,
measuring the depth of the heal and distance between
prints, the person who had made the prints had been running.� They had also been carrying a heavy
load.� Perhaps retuning
from a hunt.� With the smell of a
fresh kill would soon attract predators.�
Running with your prize to a more secure location, where you could
properly butcher the carcase would make sense, especially if being
pursued.� 

&nbsp;

Dr Bartletts� thoughts strayed again as he imagined the
scene.� The tribal hunter running with
his prize draped over his shoulder.� His
simple spear held in one had as he ran to a safe place, or settlement, where
members of the tribe using simple flint and bone tools could butcher the
precious meat.� This was a wonderful
picture with only one small problem.� The
rock in which the footprints were formed was approximately half a million years
old.� At this time one might expect to
see Homo Erectus.�
Homo Sapiens were just beginning to emerge, but
the earliest traces of modern man found were dated at only one hundred and
forty thousand years ago and these human footprints were at least three hundred
and sixty years older than that.� Dr
Bartlett scratched his chin once more as he stared at the footprints once more.

&nbsp;

South
Africa 4,985,261 BC

&nbsp;

The
forest, one moment a constant cacophony with the sounds of the life, became
suddenly still, as if the creatures became aware of some great storm
approaching, which they had been unaware of until that moment.� Pressure seemed to drop and the animals
huddled into themselves awaiting the inevitable downpour.� And then a great clap of thunder rocked the
peace and quiet and a great wind tour at the branches of the trees and
threatened to suck the animals from their homes.

&nbsp;

The
centre of the storm was situated three five foot above
the forest floor.� A gradually expanding
hole seamed to be cut into the air.�
Widening and funnelling a great hurricane into itself as the pressure
from two worlds attempted to equalize.�
Eventually, when the hole was wide enough a strange noise was heard
amongst that of the howling gale.� The forest
creatures huddled tightly together as the hole grew to ten feet in diameter and
a strange metal creature emerged into their world.� It was roughly box like and held two
creatures within itself.� It glided clear
of the hole before stopping.� The hole then
collapsed in on itself before disappearing completely and returning the forest
to its previous calm.

&nbsp;

Dr
Jenny Patterson opened the door and got out of vehicle.� Walking over to the spot where the time rift
had collapsed, she took a small stone like device from her bum bag and placed
it on the ground.� As if by itself it
began to burry itself into the earth.�
Satisfied she returned to the vehicle. 

&nbsp;

�Can
you test the transmission Ash?�

&nbsp;

Her
assistant, Paula Ashcroft, passed her hand over the consol and a holographic
display appeared on the vehicles dash board.�
It showed a detailed representation of the terrain, the centre of which
showed the vehicle, as well as a bright red dot, just behind it.� Above the dot were a series of numbers,
indicating latitude and longitude.� Below
this a time reference had started to count down.

&nbsp;

�The
tracker is active.� We will be able to
find the rift when it returns in three months,� she stated as she passed her
hand over the console again and the holograph collapsed back into the dash
board.

&nbsp;

Paula
blinked as her nanites linked with the vehicles
controls and, at the speed of thought, the craft lifted into the air and both
occupants merged with the vehicles scanners in order to find a suitable place
to set up camp.

&nbsp;

At
first glance, one would be mistaken for assuming that the two travellers were
in their mid twenties.� They were both
remarkably pretty, Dr Patterson, the leader of the team, was a stunning five
foot six natural red head, complete with freckles and clear green eyes.� Ms Ashcroft, her assistant, was a very pale
blond of fair complexion and pale blue eyes.�
Both appeared to be very athletic in build and whom the gods had blessed
with classic hour glass figures.

&nbsp;

The
casual observer would have been very wrong in their estimates.� Dr Patterson was, in fact, over two hundred
and thirty, while her assistant was a modest one hundred and eighty years
old.� Their longevity
being the result of the extensive Prolong treatments, common to fifty first
century medicine.� Also, their
astounding beauty had little to do with the whims of genetics, or the
favourable smile of a passing god.� In
fact, the nanites which enable fifty first century
citizens to merge with machinery, communicate over distances, or experience
entertainment, have also been re-sculpting and enhancing their natural bodies
since they were born.� Sometimes a little
guidance was instilled into the programs by the Medicos, but usually, the
sculpting was directed by the user, or by the nanites standard repair and improve capabilities.

&nbsp;

As a
consequence of this, both women were fit enough to compete in a twentieth
century Olympic event.� Their bodies
could sustain long periods of duress.�
They could also repair minor damage quickly.� In fact their musculature had been
strengthened on a molecular level by nanites.� In addition to all of this, their immune
system had been enhanced to such a point that they could overcome most diseases
with ease.� They could also eat and
process virtually any food.� And since
cell damage was instantly repaired by the self replicating machines, death was
all but non existent on the fifty first century Earth.

&nbsp;

�Baal, which meant the lame one in the
language, was unaware of all of this as he watched the two newcomers set up
their camp from the safety of the shrubs in which he hid with his companion Ashur the grey.� Last
mating he had thought with Apsu for the right to
breed.� He had lost his claim and had
suffered such damage to his leg that he had been expelled from the people, sent
out to die or prosper without the tribes help.�
He had met Ashur shortly after.� Ashur was too old
to chase game and had been sent out to die.�
Ashur had decided to help Baal recover.� In return for this help and using Ashurs greater knowledge, the two were able to
prosper.� Although they could no longer
chase game, they could survive on grubs and set traps.� Speed was no longer their ally, but they
still possessed strength and cunning.� Neither new who these newcomers were, or what they were
doing, but Baal was too cunning to rush into new situations like some young
buck out to impress his elders.� As if by
some signal, both backed away from the edge of the clearing to consider and
watch.

&nbsp;

�It had been two weeks since the women had
arrived.� They returned to camp with
their latest prize, a small ape like creature, perhaps three foot in
height.� A forerunner
of the chimp perhaps.� She doubted
that this was one of mans ancestors, since the skeletal structure, particularly
the hips were more akin to knuckle shufflers, rather than true bipeds.� Even so, they had proved to be very strong
and, as Paula had discovered, carried a very nasty bite.� As a consequence, as well as the collar and
cuffs which were normally used to restrain the animals, so that they could be
brought back to the camp and cages, Dr Ashcroft had used the fabricator to
generate a head harness which would both prevent further painful bites.Their captive trudged along unhappily behind the two
women, painful memories of being stung with a long stick acting as sufficient
incentive to follow their lead.

&nbsp;

Back
at camp the subject was anaesthetised and placed into his storage box.� Once he was hooked up to the life support
machine, the box was sealed and labelled, ready for shipment back to the
universities primate labs for study and classification.� It had been a good hunt, but they still had
not found their quarry, one of their reasons for coming, Homo Erectus, or even the rarer species of this period, Homo Sapien.� Dr Patterson
had written several journals on the species, based on probe data and the
archaeological record.� Consequently, she
was the foremost authority on this period and was the natural choice to lead
this mission once the University had secured funding for the timeslot into this
period.� He assistant had been drawn from
over five thousand applicants, but rather than choosing on academic basis
alone, Paula had lead several expeditions into the Los Angeles Crater expanding
the knowledge of third millennium American society. As well as these impressive
credentials, Paula also possessed survival and Bush skills having grown up in
the Southern Republic.� A natural� choice to
assist in this expedition.

&nbsp;

However
well prepared both women thought they were, nothing
could have acclimatized them to the heat of this place, even at night.� After supper both women were grateful for the
chance to slip out of the stuffy one pieces and crawl
into the climate controlled sleeping bags.�
Today had been long and hard and tom mow would be the same.� Sleep, therefore, was quick in coming as the
timenaughts crawled into their sacks for the night.

&nbsp;

Baal
and Ashur crept into the strangers
camp.� By now they knew the strangers
habits and patterns.� They also knew what
their noses had told them on that first morning.� These were females.� Baal had missed the matings
that he had participated in and these, while ugly, were still an outcasts prayer.� They
might also be the answer to another prayer, but that remained to be seen.� From their hiding place, they had watched and
noted and learnt.� Now they would see.

&nbsp;

Jenny
awoke from her sleep as her companion screamed.�
Something heavy landed on her and large fingers groped at her sleeping
bag.

&nbsp;

�What
the�.� Lights.� Security proto�Mphhh,�
she gasped as the air was forced from her lungs as a powerful arm pounded her
stomach.

&nbsp;

At
the same time the lights activated revealing a large, ape like creature.� The creature that she had
hoped to find, pinning her to the floor.�
Homo Erectus.�
The creature snapped a collar around her throat and then ripped her
sleeping bag clean in half.� Jenny
Screamed and then kept on screaming as the brute forced her legs apart and
raped her.� Although she possessed
prodigious strength, the creature had more.�
He also had the advantage of leverage.�
Jenny could do nothing as the monster impaled her with the largest dick
she had ever felt and began pumping in and out of her.� She screamed again and again and again until,
thankfully, she passed out.

&nbsp;

When
she came to it was light and she was outside.�
She tried to sit up, but found it difficult as her hands were secured
behind her with the shackles.� She was
also wearing the head harness with the anti bite bit.� Dazed she looked around the camp.� Paula was sitting a few feed away and wearing
similar restraints.� Both the neck chains
were secured by a large stage in the ground.�


&nbsp;

Something
flew out of the vehicle as the two creatures searched for food.� Finding nothing they eventually decided to
leave, with their prizes.� Jenny and
Paula found themselves hauled onto their knees.�
The creatures then climbed onto the women�s backs and grabbed the collar
chains.� A quick pull soon released the
stake and grabbing the improvised reigns, Baal commanded his mount, who he
would call Baalat, to move forward.� Eventually, she got the message and headed
off into the Jungle.� Ashur
bragged about his conquest and showed off the fine breasts of his beast as he
urged her forward.� This one he would
call Epona.� Ashur had not felt this good in years and would have Epona again tonight.�


&nbsp;

Urging
his mount into a run, he hefted his spear onto his shoulder.� Speed would again be his ally and he would
hunt game again.� Life was good.

&nbsp;

A
year later, Dr Ashcroft got her wish as she lay eyes
on the first Homo Sapien.� Birth control in the fifty first century
consisted of your ninites talking to your
partners.� Baal did not posses Nan
technology and now she knew her fate, as she looked at her new baby suckling at
her breast and the look of pride on her partners face.� This would be the first of many.� She would spend the rest of her extremely
long existence living as a brood mare for these creatures.� Both she and her assistant would be the
mother of an entirely new species.

&nbsp;

Dr
Bartlett looked at the ground and scratched his beard.� He did not know how humans could have existed
in this period.� But one thing was for
certain.� History would have to be
re-written and his name would be associated with this discovery.���
