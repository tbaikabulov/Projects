Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf

Synopsis: A wolf and his sub enjoy the spoils of the hunt. I thought this would be a nice story for some Halloween fun.






 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My skin&#8217;s been tingling for the last two blocks. I don&#8217;t see him yet, I never see him until he&#8217;s on me and then it&#8217;s too late. I take a different route every time, but he always finds me. I start at a noise behind me. I have to smile at my own foolishness. No human could lay a hand on me with my Alpha so near, and he never made a sound while he hunted. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At last I see him. He leans his long, powerful frame against the brick wall. His waist length dreds flow around him like living things. I know better, but I can&#8217;t stop myself. If I can just get to our gate&#8212;we play this game every full moon. I run and he catches me. I need it as much as he does. I fight as hard as I can, struggling against the truth that his strength is may times my own. I need to be conquered. 
I run flat out until I can almost touch the gate. I was within a step of the wrought iron goal post when a clawed hand grabbed me by the hair and jerked me into a steel embrace.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;re already wet for me.� His voice became a low growl mid-change. The architecture of his throat altered just enough to make speaking an effort for him. My face flooded with color. His heightened sense of smell made it impossible to hide my arousal from him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I can&#8217;t help it.� I said. My cunt clenched as images of what was to come flashed through my mind.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My Alpha slid his hand up my thighs the roughened skin played my senses&nbsp; as his hand left a tingling path in its wake on the way to my core. Gently, he slid one clawed finger across my clit. I moaned for him as he used his razor sharp claws with the delicacy and precision of a surgeon to guide me through the pathways of pain and pleasure.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t care that we stood on the sidewalk in front of our house the thought that someone could happen by excited me. I leaned against him tipping my head back to offer him my throat.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Let&#8217;s get inside before I rip this flimsy little dress off you and take you here on the sidewalk.� He said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes,� I whispered. I moaned my disappointment when he took his questing finger away from my swollen, throbbing clit. He slid the finger into my mouth and I sucked my juices from it savoring the taste of him and me together.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He picked me up and carried me inside. I closed my eyes and snuggled into him. His body ran hotter than any human&#8217;s. He set me down then tore the dress I wore in two. I stood before him in nothing but a lavender lace and satin bra. He loved lacy, fancy bras, but he had no use for panties.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�All the better to smell you my dear.� He&#8217;d told me once when I asked him about it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I want a taste.� He said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Turning away from him, I bent over the dining table and spread my legs wide for him.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I moaned as his tongue rasped my wet core.&nbsp; He must have completed the change as he crossed the short distance between us. I turned to look at him, but a deep growl warned me to hold position.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His tongue was long, hot and rough. He traced my cunt lips ratcheting my desire higher each time he circled closer to my clit. Plunging his firm tongue into my cunt, he tongue-fucked me until I bucked against his snout. I begged him for mercy--for release. All I wanted at that moment was to be filled with him, and to be allowed to cum. Impatient, I growled my need he gave me a little nip on the back of my neck as a reminder that the Alpha would decided when or if I would have any release. 
His strong jaws grabbed my ankle and drew me down to the floor. Knowing that those jaws could bite through the flesh and bone of my legs like they were French fries sent a frisson of fear through me that he must have smelled almost immediately. He released my leg and growled his pleasure against my cunt sending vibrations through my entire torso.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My Alpha raised himself up over me on four legs all muscle and black fur.&nbsp; He stood at least 5 feet at the shoulder. His eyes were utterly alien, yet utterly familiar. His human eyes were chocolate brown, but as a wolf his eyes glowed amber. I shivered with need I was so wet-- so ready to cum. I didn&#8217;t look into his eyes too long the wolf would take it as a challenge. His wolf demanded utter submission. I watched his right forepaw rake down my body. He opened up four cuts that welled with dark, rich blood immediately. My back bowed from the pain. He would to taste all of me tonight. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I arched toward him seeking more. The pain transformed into a bolt of pleasure that threatened to snap my control.&nbsp; My cunt squeezed in rhythmic pulses. I opened my eyes and took deep breaths to hold back the orgasm that threatened my obedience to him. 
 His massive weight held me in place. I am his flesh, blood, sex and spirit. For a moment, he watched the blood weave trails down my body. Then he lapped at the marks he&#8217;d just inscribed on my body not wanting to miss one heady drop flavored with my fear, pain and passion. His saliva gave me the gift of near lycan healing. By the time he&#8217;d licked away the last of the blood, the cuts had healed leaving my brown skin smooth and unmarked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was ready and so was I. The weight of his cock on my thigh pressed against me impossibly hot and heavy. When he let me up I crawled beneath him so that I could mouth his balls.&nbsp; He growled his pleasure as I sucked his balls sensuously to show him my love and devotion. He was panting with need by the time he stretched my mouth with his erection. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He fucked my mouth with sure, steady strokes. He wasn&#8217;t in a hurry he enjoyed watching me hump the floor trying to sooth my own ache. It got him off to know his bitch was in heat for him. My cunt ached to be filled so much I tried to lose myself in worshipping his cock. The taste and smell of him salty and wild was my entire universe. I gave myself over to his pleasure enveloped in his heat, my throat stuffed with his cock. He pulled out of my mouth when the first thick strands of his precum shot into my throat.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He nudged me on to my hands and knees with his muzzle. I spread my legs sticking my ass in the air shamelessly begging him to fill me. His furry belly pressed against my back like a warm, soft blanket. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He sank into me slowly giving me time to open to him and to feel every inch of his length and girth. He fucked me. He started a rhythm that got faster and harder until there was nothing left of us except heat and desire. My mouth hung open in a wailing cry that fell somewhere between electrified pain and unseemly pleasure. His breath steamed down my neck. I felt his hips tighten just before he bit into my shoulder the sudden, sharp sensation released the orgasm that I&#8217;d held back all night. Lights seemed to explode before my eyes as I collapsed into a twitching, writhing heap under my Alpha.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My orgasm triggered his knot. A swelling in his cock that traveled up the length of his shaft that stretched me to my limit. I was utterly full, utterly complete. His orgasm ripped through us both flooding me with scorching, tidal flows of his semen. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My cunt squeezed against him as wave after wave of orgasms shattered me. My screams and his howls came together in a thunderous duet of ecstasy. Locked together flesh to flesh, until his knot subsided, we were like one being every shudder, every movement sent waves of pleasure through us. I relished the time we were locked together sharing the aftershocks of our passion. After changing back to his human form he gathered me into his embrace. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That wasn&#8217;t too scary for you I hope?� he asks with a twinkle in his eye.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Smiling, I squeeze my cunt against his cock and kiss him thoroughly, �You know I&#8217;m not afraid of the big bad wolf.�
