Synopsis: An evening at home with her loving Master.
MY PET
	I sit waiting for you at the door. I've placed the fur-lined leather
cuffs on my wrists and ankles, locking them shut with the tiny padlocks you had
specially made for them. I kneel naked, with my knees somewhat apart, hands
resting palm up on my thighs and head down, as I know you like me to wait. My
hair is pulled to one side so that you may fasten the collar on me when you come
home. Every so often, I glance up at the collar on the hall table next to me,
then at the clock on the wall, anxiously awaiting your arrival home. I long to
feel the soft leather around my neck, but know better than to put it there
myself. You once came home from work early and caught me trying it on in front
of the mirror. You were so angry with me for disobeying your direct order that
no one was ever to place it around my neck but you. "My pet, that collar is not
for you to put on and take off at will. You are mine. You are to obey my wishes
at all times, even when I am not with you. I will place the collar around your
neck when I wish it, and you are not to touch it otherwise. Is that clear?" I
had been so upset with myself for disobeying and disappointing you. I lifted my
tearstained face to look up into your eyes briefly, before turning my eyes back
to the floor as was proper and nodding my assent, unable to speak. You punished
me that night so I would never forget, and even now, I shift slightly,
remembering the sting of the crop on my bottom that night. I also remember how
you lovingly smoothed the cream over my bottom to keep the skin from being
bruised, and the tender way you wiped away my tears before making love to me
until the wee hours of the morning.

	But that was another evening.

	Tonight, I sit waiting for you just the way you like, open and
vulnerable to your every look and caress. I never feel more alive and beautiful
than when I see that look of pride and possession in your eyes. You can make me
melt with that look.

	My attention is pulled back to the present as I hear your key in the
door, and then the knob turns and you walk in. My face lights up as you smile at
me, for I can see the love in your eyes, and the pleasure at seeing me obedient
to your instructions. You motion for me to rise, and as I do I take your coat
and hang it up for you. You drop the mail on the hall table and pick up the
collar in the same motion. As you do every night, you lean down to whisper into
my ear, "Is this what you've been waiting for my pet?"

	I nod my head emphatically, and you chuckle at my eagerness. I won't
speak until you give me permission, but the look in my eyes is the only consent
you need. Not that you need my consent, but it pleases you when I am compliant
with your wishes.

	Almost anticipating your wishes, I drop to my knees facing away from you
as soon as you motion for me to do so. One hand caresses my shoulder and neck
for a brief minute, sending delicious shivers through me already. Then you
gently place the collar around my neck. A small smile crosses my face as I hear
the lock click shut, and your eyes meet mine in the mirror across the hall,
smiling with pride in return.

	"Rise, my pet."

	I rise to my feet as you gather me into your arms from behind, running
your hands down over my ribcage and then back up to my breasts. You pinch my
nipples playfully, and they immediately respond by hardening at your touch. One
hand then drifts down to my completely shaved pussy, and you cup it in your hand
briefly. You turn me around and kiss me softly, teasing me by running your
tongue over the outline of my bottom lip, pulling away as I try to deepen the
kiss. "ah, ah, ah my pet, you know better than to rush things." You tease me a
moment longer by nibbling on my bottom lip, while still rolling and pinching my
nipples in your fingers, then take my hand and lead me into the living room. We
walk to the couch, and I sit at your feet as you tell me about your day. I take
your shoes off and gently massage your feet as you wind down from you busy day.
Gradually, I see the tension leave your shoulders. Then you rise, pulling me to
my feet, and lead me by the hand into our playroom.

	It was once just a large spare bedroom, but you had it converted into
your dungeon. There are rings at various heights attached to the walls, and
several hooks in the ceiling, perfect for attaching a slave's cuffs to, to keep
her in whatever position you wish. There is also a sturdy 4 poster king size bed
on one wall, a padded bench just the right height for bending me over, with
rings at the base of the four legs for attaching wrist and ankle cuffs, and
several large mirrors in various places against the walls. You love to watch me
watching myself in the mirror as you tease and torture me so deliciously.

	You lead me to the wall and attach the rings on both wrist cuffs to
hooks over my head, spread wide and at a height that barely keeps my feet flat
on the floor. I stand quietly, awaiting your wishes, but I can already feel
myself beginning to get moist with anticipation of what you plan for me tonight.

	I look to one side to watch you in one of the mirrors, and see you pick
up the riding crop you had specially made for my birthday, the one with your
name and my initials engraved on the silver tag attached to the handle. I smile
to myself, for that is my favorite. I'm so lost in anticipation of the evening's
activities, I forget to face back to the wall, and you catch me watching in the
mirror.

	"I did not give you permission to watch me or yourself in the mirror
pet. You know better. Since you can't seem to keep my instructions in mind, I'll
have to make sure you don't know what's coming."

	You walk over to the large cabinet on one wall, and open the doors.
Inside, there are all manner of crops, clamps, vibrators, cuffs, leashes,
floggers, and other toys we have collected together. Out of the corner of my
eye, I see you pick up something black, but I'm unable to identify it without
turning my head. I know better than to do so again however. As I feel the black
velvet blindfold slip down over my eyes, there is another surge of wetness from
my pussy. I hear the swish of the crop, and tense for the first stroke, but you
are simply swishing it through the air, watching as I anticipate it meeting my
flesh. You're always able to surprise me, and tonight is no different.

	"Are you ready my Pet?"

	I nod, and I hear another swish. My body tenses involuntarily as I wait
for the first delicious sting. But you have no intention of giving me what I
expect. As the crop swishes past my thigh, your hand lightly caresses my
backside, and I jump from the unexpected touch. You chuckle and run one finger
lightly down the crack of my ass, until you reach my pussy, which is already
soaking wet. You dip one finger into me, stroking in and out several times, then
remove it as I start to push back against your hand. You laugh again, "You know
better than that Pet". You lift your finger to my lips, and I take it into my
mouth, hungrily sucking on it, licking it clean of my own juices.

	As I lick and suck your finger, you finally bring the crop down across
my ass. Involuntarily, my legs move together, and I squirm away. I can almost
feel you frown, as you say "Pet, I did not give you permission to move."

	Your finger is removed from my lips, and I feel your hands pulling my
feet apart, a spreader bar placed between them, and the cuffs attached to it.
You then begin to use the crop, alternating swats across each ass cheek, then
running the tip of the crop up my inner thigh, and along my slit.  You chuckle
at my struggles to push back into the crop, seeking more contact, trying to get
you to brush against my clit, which is aching to be touched.

	You begin to strike me again with the crop, just hard enough to sting
slightly at first. The speed and force of the strikes vary to keep me off
balance. I moan at a particularly hard swat, and I begin to feel my mind slip
into sub space. Pain and pleasure begin to mingle, then become
indistinguishable. You keep cropping my ass until it is fiery red, and I'm
moaning almost continuously. I'm no longer trying to move away from your
strokes, but actually push my hips out away from the wall to give you better
access. The skin of my body has become so sensitive that even just the caress of
your breath on it drives me wild. You know my responses so well that you can
judge how I'm feeling simply by looking at my face. You run one finger lightly
down my spine, continuing down the crack of my ass to my pussy. It's dripping
wet, and your finger slides easily into it. I moan louder, and try to move
against your hand, but it's removed after just a few teasing strokes in and out
of me, causing me to groan in frustration.

	I feel the blindfold removed and blink in the soft light of the candles
you somehow managed to light in the room while I wasn't paying attention.

	"Pet, look at me."

	As I lift my eyes to yours, you continue, "You are NOT to cum yet."

	With that, you slip 2 fingers into my pussy again, and stroke several
times. My eyes drift closed and my breath comes in short pants. I squirm against
my bonds, needing more contact.

	Your fingers are abruptly withdrawn, and I feel your finger under my
chin, lifting my eyes to yours.

	"Do you understand me, my Pet?"

	I groan in frustration, and continue to squirm, my head dropping.

	This time, your hand grasps my hair tightly, and you pull my head up to
look into your eyes. "Do you understand Pet? I won't ask again."

	I hear the warning note in your voice, and see the threat in your eyes
of dire consequences should I not answer. I stare into your eyes for a few
seconds, then nod reluctantly before lowering my head and whispering �Yes Sir�.

	"Good girl."

	You take down my shackled wrists and lead me to the bed. You lay me down
on the silk sheets, which feel extremely erotic against the sensitive skin of my
reddened ass. I writhe on them, enjoying the feeling. You catch me doing so, and
you pin me motionless to the bed with just your gaze. You remind me one last
time, "No cumming until I say so Pet".

My arms are pulled above my head and attached to the straps coming from the
posts at the head of the bed. Then you pull my legs apart, attaching each one to
a post at the foot of the bed. I lay there spread-eagled, completely open to
your gaze and touch. I can't move my hands or feet more than maybe an inch in
any direction. I feel another surge of wetness as I realize again how truly
helpless I am.  My juices run down my pussy lips, and I feel your gaze on them,
almost as if your eyes alone can touch my skin. You stand at the foot of the
bed, eyes gazing first at my breasts, their nipples standing erect, then moving
down to my pussy. I can see myself in one of the many mirrors just by turning my
head a fraction, it's glistening with my juices, and it's the deep pink of
complete arousal.

	You smile almost evilly, and kneel between my legs. I feel your lips and
tongue on my inner thigh, just above my knee, and I make a small sound in the
back of my throat. Your lips and tongue begin to travel up my thigh, stopping
here and there to nip with your teeth, just enough to get my attention, but not
enough to leave a mark. As your tongue gets close to my pussy, my breath becomes
uneven, and I strain against my bonds, trying to make contact with it.  I can
feel your hot breath on the bare lips, and ever so slowly, you run your tongue
from the bottom of my slit up towards my clit. You swirl your tongue around it,
then brush it across the tip. You pick up your head from between my thighs and I
groan in frustration yet again.

	You smile as you watch me pull against my bonds. A wicked gleam comes
into your eye, and you begin to lower your head towards my pussy again. Stopping
just a few inches from it, you look up into my eyes, and say "Beg Pet. I want to
hear you beg me to pleasure you, in detail. Beg me to make you cum, then beg me
to give you permission to do so."

	I blush from head to toe. You know this is the hardest thing for me to
do, to ask for what I want, therefore, it's the thing you most want to wrest
from me. I hear your soft whisper "Do I need to ask you again Pet? Or do I leave
you here like this all night, unfulfilled?"

	For a moment, I seem to have lost my voice. I swallow hard, and a soft
whisper comes from my lips. "Please, Master, I need to feel you against me. I
want you to give me pleasure."

	"That's not good enough Pet. Tell me what you want."

	This time my voice is a little louder. "Please Master, I beg to feel
your touch against me. I want to feel your hands on my body."

	Your eyes don't leave mine, and I become more bold as I see your
approval in your eyes. "I need to feel you inside me Sir.... Your tongue, your
fingers....." I hesitate, and seem to lose my voice again for an instant, but I
quickly regain it. "Master, I beg you, I want to feel you lick my pussy, and
feel you suck on my clit. I need to feel your cock inside me." I blush as you
smile at me.

	"How badly do you want it Pet?"

	I almost sob as I reply, "More than anything I've ever wanted Master".

	You bring your head down over my pussy again, and I almost cum at the
first firm stroke of your tongue on my clit. You seem to sense how close I am,
and pull back, then begin to lick at my pussy lips, stroking your tongue over
them, then between them, one long stroke from the bottom to the top of my slit.
Your fingers gently separate my lips, baring my pussy to your gaze. Your tongue
pushes into me, and I moan, pulling against my bonds. My breath is coming in
short gasps now, and I try to lift my hips off the bed towards your hungry
mouth. Your tongue strokes in and out of me several times, then licks up to my
clit, brushing over it once before you suck it between your lips. I'm crying out
now, begging for release. You lift your head long enough to deny my request,
then you go back to sucking and nibbling on my clit, biting down softly on it. 
I'm almost frantic now, trying to hold back my orgasm. Just before I cum, your
head pulls away from me, and I cry out.

	"So needy tonight my pet. Have you been waiting for this all day?"

	My sense of embarrassment has completely disappeared with the need to
cum, "God yes Master, I've been waiting to feel your touch all day. I want to
feel your tongue and lips and teeth on my clit. I want to feel your hands on my
body, feel your cock inside me. Dear god, please!"

	"Very good pet, I knew you could ask properly if given enough
motivation."

	Having spoken those words, you plunge your tongue deep inside me,
stroking in and out several times, then moving up to suck and bite on my clit,
while you slip first one, then two fingers into me.  I begin to thrash against
my bonds, begging incoherently now, "Dear god...... Master..... please,
please......   I need...... I need to cum Master....... oh dear god....."

	Without removing your mouth from my clit, you reach down and undo my
ankle restraints. Between licks, I hear your voice say "Don't move pet, until I
tell you you may."

	You pull your head away from my pussy, and before I can even groan in
frustration, you move smoothly up to position yourself between my thighs. I feel
your cock at the entrance of my pussy. I look up into your eyes, as you slowly
reach up and undo my wrist restraints. Even though I'm no longer restrained, I
can't move, I feel pinned to the bed by your gaze.

	Just when I think I can't stand the anticipation anymore, you plunge
your cock into me in one long smooth stroke. I gasp, trying not to move, trying
not to wrap my legs around you to hold you there. I grasp the silk sheets in my
fists to keep from moving, and my eyes drift closed. You stroke in and out of me
several times, and I almost sob with the need to cum. A soft whisper escapes me,
just a single word, "Please...."

	"Open your eyes Pet."

	I look up into your eyes as you begin to move inside me, 2 long slow
strokes, pulling almost all the way out, before sliding back into me fully. You
put your hands under my ass to pull me more firmly to you, and as you pause your
stroking, I hear you say "I release you pet"

	I gasp as I realize what you've said. You haven't just given me
permission to cum, you've given me permission to become an equal in our
lovemaking..

	I wrap both my legs around your hips, and my hands reach up to grasp
your head, pulling you down to me for a deep kiss. You cock begins to stroke in
and out of me. My need is frantic, almost savage now, my fingers digging into
your back as I move with you. Your thrusts become harder, and we're both panting
now, desperate for each other. I can feel how hard your cock is, it fills me
completely, and I can see you're as close to cumming as I am.

	I can hold back no longer. Just before my orgasm begins to make my body
shake, I cry out "Master, I love you."

	As my orgasm takes over, I hear the words I've been waiting for since we
met. "You are mine pet, now and forever. I love you Terri".

	With that, we wrap ourselves tightly around each other as you take us
both over the edge into ecstasy.
