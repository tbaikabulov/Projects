Good Boy

Chapter 1

&nbsp; Danni was spreading an even layer of peanut butter on the first slice of bread. He was completely engrossed in this task. Rachel looked impatiently at him.
&nbsp; �Danni, hurry up or you will miss the bus,� Rachel said.
&nbsp; �Ok, mommy,� the boy answered, then looked up at his mother and said �You are so beautiful today, mom.�
&nbsp; �The women must be careful when you grow up dear,� Rachel said and smiled widely.
&nbsp; �What do you mean?�
&nbsp; �You are a great flatterer. Now, tell me what you want!�
&nbsp; �You are really beautiful. Everyone knows that.�
&nbsp; �Ok Danni, tell me what you want from me!�
&nbsp; Danni put the slice of bread in the dish and stared at his mother. 
&nbsp; �I just wondered if it is possible� daddy to be with us again.�
&nbsp; Rachel&#8217;s face darkened. She crumpled the napkin nervously. 
&nbsp; �Danni, we have talked about that a lot. I explained what the word divorce means. Daddy doesn&#8217;t live with us but he loves you very much. He will come to see you next Saturday. You know that.�
&nbsp; �Why do you hate him?� Danni asked angrily. 
&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t hate him. We just can&#8217;t live together anymore. You have to understand that.�
&nbsp; �But mom, we need him. What if you got sick? Who&#8217;s going to take care for me then? �
&nbsp; �Your pretty mother will always be taking care of you. Now, get ready for school.�
&nbsp; Danni stood up abruptly and ran up the stairs to his room. He didn&#8217;t want Rachel to see the tears in his eyes. 
&nbsp; �Are you ready?� Rachel cried out impatiently from the kitchen.
&nbsp; �I am coming mom�
***
&nbsp; The school bus brought Danni home at 2 p.m. He got in, locked the front door, went in his room and lied on his bed. He lied motionlessly for more than an hour, just staring at the ceiling. Then he paced to the bathroom. He kneeled down and ran the palms of his hands on the cold tiles. After that he went down to the garage. Some of his father&#8217;s belongings were still there. Danni read the labels of some of the plastic bottles dumped into the corner and found what he was looking for.
&nbsp; Rachel got back from work at 6 p.m. She kicked off her pumps and threw her purse on the couch.
&nbsp; �Danni, where are you dear?� she asked loudly.
&nbsp; �In my room, mom?�
&nbsp; �Did you eat your lunch today?�
&nbsp; �Yes, mum.�
&nbsp; �What are you doing now? Playing computer games, aren&#8217;t you?�
&nbsp; �No. I am doing my homework.�
&nbsp; �You are not lying to me, are you?�
&nbsp; Rachel didn&#8217;t wait for his answer. She took off her skirt and hastily unbuttoned her white blouse. It was a tiring day so she badly wanted a refreshing shower. Pacing towards the bathroom, Rachel felt the pleasant coolness of the hardwood floor under her stockinged feet. The tiles near the door were as slippery as ice. Her right foot slipped forward. She flailed her arms trying to regain balance. In this moment her left foot slipped too. Her ankle twisted inwards and she fell down heavily.
&nbsp; Danni heard his mother&#8217;s painful cry, turned off the computer and ran out the room and down the stairs. Rachel was sitting in the middle of the bathroom, clasping her left ankle with both hands. She whimpered then tightened her lips as she saw her son coming. She didn&#8217;t want to scare him.
&nbsp; �Mommy, what happened?� Danni asked with a trembling voice.
&nbsp; �I slipped, Danni. The tiles are so slippery. I had to be more cautious.�
&nbsp; �Did you hurt yourself, mom? Why are you crying?�
&nbsp; Rachel rubbed her tears away with the end of her sleeve and tried to smile. Her smile looked more like a grimace though.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp; �I am fine, dear. Just � my ankle is a bit sore. Don&#8217;t worry about me. Could you please bring my purse? � 
&nbsp; Danni turned and headed to the living room. Rachel dragged herself to the toiled pan. Holding on the sink for support, she managed to lift herself up and sit on the pan. She lifted her left leg, flexed her knee and rested her calf on her right knee. The pain made her feel dizzy. She closed her eyes for a moment, took a deep breath and tried to calm down. Then she leant forward to examine her injured ankle. A swelling had stared to grow under the black stocking. Even the slightest movement was causing a nasty, shooting pain.
&nbsp; �Mom!�
&nbsp; �What?�
&nbsp; Danni reached out to give her the purse. Rachel stared uncomprehendingly at him.
&nbsp; �Oh�the purse� thanks Danni,� she mumbled and took it.
&nbsp; The boy cocked his head and looked intently at Rachel&#8217;s swollen ankle while she blew her nose. He wanted desperately to know what she was thinking. Then he took a towel and started wiping the tiles.
&nbsp; �The tiles must have been wet,� Danni said.
&nbsp; �Sure. You have to be more careful than me. Promise!�&nbsp; 
&nbsp; �OK mommy.� 
&nbsp; As Danni whipped the tiles clean, Rachel propped herself on the wall and stood up, awkwardly balancing on her good leg. She kept her left foot safely off the floor.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; �Can you put weight on it,� Danni asked worriedly.
&nbsp; �I think � I should not do that�
&nbsp; �Lean on me mom!�
&nbsp; As they made their way to the living room, Rachel barely managed to stifle her gasps. Every hop was shaking her injured ankle.&nbsp; The pain was gradually becoming intolerable. Finally they got to the couch and Rachel slumped on it. She pulled the stocking down her leg to her ankle. Then wincing, she gingerly removed it. Danni&#8217;s eyes popped out at the sight. 
&nbsp; �We must call daddy!� He said calmly.
&nbsp; Rachel tensed and glared at her son. 
&nbsp; �We don&#8217;t need him, Danni! I don&#8217;t want to hear you talking about him anymore,� she said angrily.
&nbsp; �But mommy� he always knows what must be done.�
&nbsp; �Give me the phone!� Rachel ordered.
&nbsp; Danni&#8217;s face brightened and he hurried to bring it to his mother.
&nbsp; Rachel took it impatiently and dialed 911.

Chapter 2

&nbsp; Rachel threw the phone on the couch and buttoned up her blouse. As her hands were trembling violently this task took more than a minute. After that, she struggled into her skirt, moaning from time to time. His lips pursed, Danni was staring impassively at his mother. He felt distraught and was barely able to stifle his emotions. Rachel looked at him, reached out and tenderly took his hand. Danni winced. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Everything will be all right, Danni. I feel better now,� Rachel explained softly.
&nbsp; Danni nodded. 
&nbsp; �Bring me the shoes, dear!�
&nbsp; Danni looked around and saw that her mother&#8217;s pumps were left off near the table. He brought them, then rested them beside her feet. Rachel slipped the right shoe on, looked at her swollen ankle and sighed.
&nbsp; The doorbell started to ring. Danni didn&#8217;t react at first. 
&nbsp; �Danni, the door,� Rachel rasped.
 Danni got out to open the front door.
 The paramedic took a cursory glance at Rachel&#8217;s injured ankle, kneeled before her and deftly put her leg in a splint. Leaning on the wall, Danni was observing curiously. 
&nbsp; �I will be back in a couple of hours. There is a fried chicken in the fridge. If you prefer, you can make sandwiches. And don&#8217;t watch too much TV,� Rachel said.
&nbsp; �OK, mum. Don&#8217;t you want me to come with you?�
&nbsp; �No need, dear. Now give me a hug!�
&nbsp; 
***
&nbsp;&nbsp; It was already dark outside when Danni heard a car coming to a stop. He looked out the window, but could not see anything. A minute later the doorbell started to ring impatiently. He ran to open the door.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rachel was standing outside, smiling sheepishly at her son. She was leaning on a pair of aluminum crutches. Her casted left leg was hanging down, useless as never before. The white plaster cast started at the base of her toes, kept her knee bent at an angle and disappeared somewhere under her skirt. 
&nbsp; �Wow,� Danni exclaimed and blushed.
&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t worry, Danni. I am fine.�
&nbsp; The boy moved aside to make room for his mother. Rachel got in, carefully picking her way. Her graceful gait was now replaced by an awkward crutching. Danni felt a wave of guilt washing over him. He wondered if his mother could notice his uneasiness.
&nbsp; �Is it broken mommy?�
&nbsp; �Yes. My ankle turned out to be broken,� Rachel replied as she headed toward the couch.
&nbsp; �What we gonna do now?�
&nbsp; �Just what we normally do, dear. Watch TV, and then go to bed. Nothing has changed really.� 
&nbsp; �But your leg�I don&#8217;t know what to do.�
&nbsp; �Nothing can be done. Don&#8217;t pay so much attention to the cast! It just keeps my leg immobilized. I know it looks scary but I will definitely live,� Rachel said and giggled.
&nbsp; �That&#8217;s good. Do you want a sandwich?�
&nbsp; �I am not hungry but you can bring me a beer,� she said and slumped into the couch. 
&nbsp; Happy to be of any use, Danni returned as faster as he could. Rachel has managed to pull the table closer and was about to lift her casted leg on it. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Let me help you mom.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; Danni bent down and took the cast cautiously. Its heaviness surprised him.&nbsp; The smooth plaster made him feel strangely agitated. A second later, the cast was on the table.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �I will get a pillow,� Danni said, thinking about the opportunity to touch the cast again.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �What a good boy you are, Danni! I love you so much!� 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �I love you too, mom.�

***
 
&nbsp;&nbsp; The first thing Rachel saw as she woke up the next morning was her son standing beside her bed. She glanced up at the clock. It was early. 
&nbsp; �What are you doing here, Danni?� she asked and rubbed her eyes.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; �I wanted to make sure that you are all right,� Danni replied.
&nbsp; Rachel yawned and looked at her casted leg. It was propped up on a pile of pillows. The memories of the previous day rushed into her mind. She tried to chase them away.
&nbsp; �I am fine,� she said despite the pain that stared to gnaw at her broken ankle. 
&nbsp; �Your toes look swollen,� Danni said worriedly.
&nbsp; �Maybe you are right �but it is normal under the circumstances.�
&nbsp; Rachel wiggled her toes to check if they function properly. The pain gnawed deeper. She took two of the pills the doctor prescribed and sat up in bed. Danni stepped back and opened his mouth to say something, but nothing came out.
&nbsp; �Give me the crutches, please!�
&nbsp; Rachel swung her legs sideways and lowered them cautiously on the floor. Her face grew paler. She took the crutches and slowly stood up, placing them under her armpits. The pain almost knocked her down. She swayed precariously and gasped.
&nbsp; �Mommy, mommy!�
&nbsp; �It is Ok, dear�I am fine, just a bit dizzy. Don&#8217;t worry!� Rachel said and headed toward the bathroom.
&nbsp; Danni followed her, looking at the rhythmical swaying of the cast.
&nbsp; �You are not going to go into the bathroom with me, young man, are you?� she asked sweetly, producing a smile. 
&nbsp; �Of course not�you are a girl,� Danni said and blushed. 
&nbsp; Rachel could not stop herself laughing. Her smile disappeared as she saw the spot where she had slipped and broken her ankle.
&nbsp; �Be cautious!� Danni said as if he read her thoughts.
&nbsp; �I learned my lesson,� she replied sarcastically with a grin.
&nbsp; Half an hour later, they had breakfast together. Danni was despondent and moody. Rachel stole glances at him occasionally, but didn&#8217;t say anything. She wondered if the accident was still disturbing him.
&nbsp; �Does daddy know what happened to you?�
&nbsp; �There is no need for him to know,� Rachel hissed.
&nbsp; �But mom� he will be glad to help you ��
&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t need any help. Get ready for school!�
&nbsp; �Mom, I am just trying to��
&nbsp; �You are trying is to bring us together, but this will never be possible.&nbsp; Stop thinking about him!�
&nbsp; Danni started to cry bitterly. Rachel&#8217;s features softened. She reached out, drew him closer and kissed him tenderly.
&nbsp; �I hate you!� the boy cried out loudly, and ran away. 

Chapter 3

&nbsp; It was well past midnight, but Danni still couldn&#8217;t fall asleep. He was thinking about the time he spent with his father. It was a perfect Saturday. The thought that he would not be seeing him during the next two weeks made him angry. 
&nbsp; �It&#8217;s not fair,� Danni whispered,� I do not deserve that� 
&nbsp; He was drifting into a sleep when a strange noise startled him. He couldn&#8217;t determine what it was, but it sounded like a clattering of metal. A silence ensued. Then the same sound again. Danni stood up and padded to the door. It was dark in the corridor. Deciding not to turn on the light, he silently got out of his room and headed toward the staircase. His eyes gradually adjusted to the darkness. He stopped as he reached the stairs and, looked down. The living room was dark, but Danni felt that there is someone there.
&nbsp; �Not now!� Danni heard his mother whispering.
&nbsp; �Why not?� the man asked. 
&nbsp; �I told you already,� Rachel said irritably,�I don&#8217;t want my son hearing us.�
&nbsp; �You are so beautiful when you are angry!�
&nbsp; �Shut up, Mike!�
&nbsp; �Ok,Ok.�
&nbsp; �My crutches fell on the floor. Do you see them?�
&nbsp; �You don&#8217;t need them now, Rachel. I&#8217;m holding you!�
&nbsp; �We can&#8217;t do it here. Stop it!�
&nbsp; �Gosh! I&#8217;m harder than your cast.�
&nbsp; �Mike, be cautious! My leg still hurts.� 
&nbsp; �Sorry, sweetie.�
&nbsp; �Carry me to the bedroom!� Rachel moaned. 
&nbsp; �Ok, fine. Maybe I will find out how to remove your panties. The cast makes it quite difficult to me,� the man said lewdly.
&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t turn on the lights, and get my crutches.�
&nbsp; �Your breasts are gorgeous!�
&nbsp; Danni could not bear it anymore. He ran to his room and locked himself in. He could not understand why his mother let this stranger touch her. 
***
&nbsp; Danni was shocked as he saw Rachel smiling at him in the morning. She behaved as if nothing had happened at all. He looked down at his feet to conceal the anger that was burning in his eyes. 
&nbsp; �Are you Ok, Danni?&#8217;
&nbsp; �I&#8217;m fine, mom.�
&nbsp; �Look at me!�
&nbsp; Danni reluctantly complied.
&nbsp; �You played computer game all night, didn&#8217;t you?�
&nbsp; �No mom, I just��
&nbsp; �You what?� 
&nbsp; �I didn&#8217;t sleep much. I was worried about you.�
&nbsp; �Me! I told you that my ankle is a lot better. The cast will be removed soon.�
&nbsp; �But I heard you moaning last night,� Danni persisted.
&nbsp; �Oh� I got up to drink water, and hit my toes against the table� so� that&#8217;s it,� Rachel explained innocently and smiled.

*** 
&nbsp; Rachel pulled the car out of the garage and stopped to see if Danni will close the garage door. As he did so, she waved at him, placed her casted leg in a convenient position, and headed for work. She felt satisfied that she could drive. As the transmission was automatic, the cast wasn&#8217;t a big obstacle. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; The traffic light turned red as she neared the intersection. Rachel put on the brakes and reached to take a CD. Her right foot sank down. The brake pedal felt unnaturally soft. The car didn&#8217;t even slow down. She pressed the pedal harder, but the car didn&#8217;t react. Her hands grasped the wheel. Every muscle in her body tensed. She turned abruptly to the left to avoid hitting the car in front. The wheels screeched and the tail swung. She somehow managed to regain control of the car. A terrified pedestrian jumped aside to avoid being run over. The car shot through the intersection. For a second, Rachel thought that she could do it. Then a truck loomed ahead like a monster, and she knew that the crash was inevitable. 

Chapter 4 

 The sound of the impact was terrifying. The windshield burst in. Rachel felt the enormous force that pressed down on her body. Then, abruptly everything went black. 
&nbsp; A couple of minutes later, she regained consciousness. The first thing she saw was the twisted dashboard. Knuckles white, her hands were still clutched on the steering wheel. The front of the car was crushed. The hood had turned into surrealistic sculpture. She nearly laughed at the thought.
&nbsp; �Do you hear me, ma&#8217;am?�
 Rachel turned to the left and saw a man was trying to open the driver&#8217;s door. 
&nbsp; �Yep,� she answered perkily, trying to regain composure.
&nbsp; �Are you all right? Do you feel any pain?� the man inquired as he was fumbling with the door. 
&nbsp; �I am not really sure. My head is still dizzy...�
&nbsp; �Didn&#8217;t you see the red light?�
&nbsp; �Of course I saw it, but the car didn&#8217;t stop. I think there is something wrong with the brakes.�
&nbsp; Rachel looked at the rear- view mirror and saw her frightened face. There was a tiny scratch on her forehead. She examined it closely and took her purse. She was about to open it when she felt that the fingers of her left hand were numb. Her little finger was twitching spasmodically. As she was moving her fingers, the pain exploded. It shot up her forearm, toward her shoulder.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Oh, that&#8217;s not good� Rachel whispered to herself.
&nbsp; Then she saw a bruise just below her left elbow, and a second later, a slight, but nasty looking bent.
&nbsp; �We will get you out here in a minute,� the man said worriedly.
&nbsp; �My arm is broken,� Rachel announced.
&nbsp; The man pulled the door harder. It didn&#8217;t even budge. Rachel looked down to see if the cast was damaged. There was no way to find out. Her lower body was covered with large pieces of the broken dashboard. She tried to move her legs, but they were trapped in the wreckage.
&nbsp; A group of paramedics arrived at the crash scene. One of them examined Rachel&#8217;s eyes.
&nbsp; �I think my arm is broken,� Rachel said.
&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll take care of you as soon as the firefighters cut the door open,� the paramedic answered. 
&nbsp; �Thanks! Are they coming yet?�
&nbsp; �They will be here in a minute, young lady. Now tell me is it just your arm that hurts?� the paramedic ask and stared at the smashed front of the car.
&nbsp; �Yes. I am pretty sure my legs are intact. They are stuck, but I don&#8217;t feel any pain there. Just an unpleasant tingling,� Rachel explained.
 �Can you wiggle your toes?�
 �My legs are so numb that I am not sure if my toes move at all.�
The firefighters arrived and immediately prepared to cut the door. Rachel gave them a faint smile, then closed her eyes and waited to be freed from the wreckage. A minute later the door fell off with a screech of metal. 
 �Have you been in an accident before? Your leg is casted.� one of the firefighters said.
 �I broke my ankle a month ago.�
 �Was it a car crash?� he asked and removed a large piece of the ruined dashboard.
 �No, I slipped in the bathroom. I am a good driver,� she said, laughing.
 �I didn&#8217;t want to offend you.� 
 �No problem,� Rachel said, and bent over to see if the cast is damaged.
 �You better stay put, young lady,� the paramedic piped out.
 �I just wanted to��
 �Let&#8217;s get her out, guys,� the paramedic said.
&nbsp; Rachel felt a pair of strong hands slipped under her armpits, and another pair, beneath her knees. She cradled her injured arm with her good one. They lifted her as gently as possible. Her right knee bent slightly and the bone fragments in her fractured femur grated against each other. Finally, the pain was unleashed. Her eyes bulging, Rachel started to writhe, screaming uncontrollably. 
&nbsp; �Hold her tight! Keep her legs straight!� the paramedic roared.
&nbsp; �Ohhhh, what has happened to my legs?� she managed to moan out.
&nbsp; �What a brave girl you are! Stay still, dear. Please!� said the paramedic and prepared to place a mask on Rachel&#8217;s face.
&nbsp; �My boy is alone��
&nbsp;&nbsp; A minute later, she slipped into merciful unconsciousness. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Chapter 5
&nbsp; 
&nbsp; Rachel felt that someone was tenderly caressing her right hand. She was so sleepy that at first, she thought it was a dream. A minute later, she mustered enough curiosity to open her eyes. Her ex-husband Ted was sitting beside her bed. He withdrew his hand as he saw that she was awake. He looked confused and worried. Rachel blinked at him, not really aware what had happened. Then her eyes bulged as she saw the lower part of her body.
&nbsp; �This colour suits you quite well,� Ted said.
&nbsp; Rachel&#8217;s legs were in light- blue fiberglass casts. Bent slightly at the knees, they were suspended on slings. 
&nbsp; �Do you really think it is funny?� Rachel said angrily.
&nbsp; �I didn&#8217;t want to offend you. I just liked the colour.�
&nbsp; �Yea, sure. Does Danni know what happened?
&nbsp; �Yes, I told him a couple of hours ago. 
&nbsp; �How did he react? Is he alone now?�
&nbsp; �Look Rachel, don&#8217;t think about him! He is OK.�
&nbsp; �How come you found out about the accident?�
&nbsp; �I was notified by the police.� 
&nbsp; Rachel hemmed, then grew silent and examined her casted left arm. The cast had the same, light blue colour. A moment later, she noticed the spreader bar that has placed between her ankles. 
&nbsp; �What the fuck is this!� Rachel exclaimed.
&nbsp; �It keeps the cast stable, I guess.� 
&nbsp; In this moment Rachel became aware that under the hospital gown her waist was embraced by tight fiberglass. She tried to hide her confusion. Ted smiled amiably. 
&nbsp; �Your legs had to be immobilized. This type of cast is called a double hip spica. It prevents any motion, allowing the fractures to heal.�
&nbsp; �How come I hadn&#8217;t felt any pain in my legs at first?�, Rachel asked despondently.
&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t know. I am sure the doctor will explain,� Ted said.
&nbsp; �It is so disturbing � to see my legs � in this position.�
&nbsp; �In my opinion this position is quite attractive,� Ted&#8217;s smile broadened.
&nbsp; Rachel wondered if her panties had been removed. She wanted to check but Ted&#8217;s presence stopped her. It seemed logical that her private parts were exposed. 
&nbsp; �� and there is something inviting in it,� he added.
&nbsp; �Yes, surely you are very happy that I had an accident.� 
&nbsp; �No, I am not.�
&nbsp; �By the way, can you see my pussy from your vantage point?�
&nbsp; �I was able to do that but I pulled the gown down to cover you.�
&nbsp; �Very kind of you,� Rachel said mockingly.
&nbsp; �I have always respected your privacy, Rachel.� 
&nbsp; �Ted, who is going to take care for Danni now? I won&#8217;t be able to�� 
&nbsp; �Me.�
&nbsp; �Do you mind that?�
&nbsp; �Of course not.�
&nbsp; �How long I have to stay in the hospital?�
&nbsp; Ted shrugged. �Your right femur is fractured. That&#8217;s the main problem. The doctor said it will take a long time to heal. The tibial fracture on the left will heal faster. �
&nbsp; Rachel looked at the cast and wondered what will happen to her son. She wanted to see him badly. Her eyes moistened.
&nbsp; �Are you in pain, Rachel?� Ted asked.
&nbsp; �I will cope with it.� 
&nbsp; �I am so sorry about you.�
&nbsp; Rachel looked at him and was surprised to see the anxiety in his eyes.
&nbsp; �So �you came to see me and waited for me to wake up?�
&nbsp; �I came here and stayed with you for an hour, then went to tell Danni, then came back again,� he said.
&nbsp; �Very nice of you.�
&nbsp; �It was a real pleasure sitting beside you, watching your unnaturally calm face, and of course taking the opportunity to explore your cute little toes.�
&nbsp; Rachel looked at her toes. They were sticking out of the casts, peeping out like curious tiny creatures. The fact that she could not move her lower body made her feel vulnerable, and somehow � exposed. At the same time, she felt a small spark of thrill, which was gradually getting bigger. That new sensation puzzled her. 
&nbsp; �Do not even dare to touch my toes!� she said in a mock anger.
&nbsp; �I barely manage to stop myself,� Ted uttered, �Why don&#8217;t you just wiggle your toes for me.�
&nbsp; Rachel complied, then moaned as the pain intensified.
&nbsp; �It was obviously a bad idea,� he said.
&nbsp; �I feel like a wreck,� Rachel gasped pitifully.
&nbsp; �Danni wants to come to see you. I could bring him tomorrow.�
&nbsp; �What about today?�
&nbsp; �I think that you should rest now. Tomorrow he will be here to visit his broken mommy.�
&nbsp; �Thank you so much, Ted.� 
&nbsp; �Get better soon, dear!� he said and kissed her left temple. 

Chapter 6

&nbsp; Danni was walking down the long corridor, his heart galloping. He squeezed his father&#8217;s hand, but that didn&#8217;t make him feel any better. He knew that his poor mother was suffering because of him. The guilt was almost unbearable.
&nbsp; �Danni, she is all right, just wearing strange outfits.�
 The words passed unheard.
&nbsp; �Danni!�
&nbsp; �Yes, daddy.�
&nbsp; Ted looked at his son, opened his mouth, then changed his mind and decided to remain silent.
&nbsp; Rachel&#8217;s painful expression disappeared as she saw her son.
&nbsp; �Could you please leave us alone for a while, Ted?�
&nbsp; �So be it, dear lady.� 
&nbsp; Danni&#8217;s eyes were draw by the enormous blue cast. 
&nbsp; �Danni!� Rachel exclaimed.
&nbsp; He gave a start and willed himself to look at his mother.
&nbsp; �There is black and white in everything.�
&nbsp; Danni looked at her uncomprehendingly.
&nbsp; �Now you will be spending more time with Ted. It&#8217;s great, isn&#8217;t it?
&nbsp; �Why did they do that to you, mom?�
&nbsp; �I am not sure what you mean.�
&nbsp; �The cast is so �big.�
&nbsp; �It is just a strange looking outfit. To tell you the truth, I feel quite comfortably.�
&nbsp; �You don&#8217;t look comfortable at all. And your legs��
&nbsp; �My legs?�
&nbsp; �Why did they spread them like that?�
&nbsp; �They will heal faster that way.�
&nbsp; �Strange. It seems as though someone has tried to punish you?� 
&nbsp; �Your thoughts are getting a bit too negative.� 
&nbsp; �Sorry, mom.�
&nbsp; �Come here! Give me a hug, Danni.� 
&nbsp; Danni padded to the bed in such a solemn manner as is his mother was some kind of temple. Her soft embrace calmed him down a little. By chance he placed his hand on the upper part of the cast. His hair stood on end. He realized that she couldn&#8217;t feel his touch. The cast was holding his mother in an unyielding grip. This made him feel jealous. 
&nbsp; �Daddy didn&#8217;t tell me that you are so� broken.�
&nbsp; �What did he tell you?� Rachel asked.
&nbsp; �That your legs are broken �and your arm.�
&nbsp; �That&#8217;s true.�
&nbsp; �But why the cast is covering your tummy?�
&nbsp; �They had to do that in order to immobilize my legs completely.� 
&nbsp; �Does it hurts, mom?�
&nbsp; �No, no my dear.� 
&nbsp; Danni sniffed a couple of times, then the tears started pouring out of his eyes.
&nbsp; �Please stop, Danni! You are going to break my heart as well.� 
&nbsp; He thought her words over, and did his best to stop the flow of tears.
&nbsp; �It&#8217;s better now,� Rachel said and ruffled his hair.
&nbsp; �How long you have to stay in the hospital?&#8217;
&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t know,� she said, her face darkening considerably.
&nbsp; �Are you able to walk on crutches now?�
&nbsp; Rachel couldn&#8217;t stop herself smiling wickedly as she looked at her wide spread legs. Danni followed her gaze and nodded.
&nbsp; �So you have to stay in bed all the time?�
&nbsp; �Well, isn&#8217;t it obvious?� she answered nervously.
&nbsp; �But when you have to go to the��
&nbsp; �The nurse knows what to do if I need something.�
&nbsp; �I would like to stay with you. I could sleep in this chair over there,� Danni said with a low voice.
&nbsp; Rachel smiled amiably.
&nbsp; �No, no my dear. You have to go home. I promise you to stay here and wait for you to come tomorrow.�
&nbsp; Danni had a reason to believe that she will keep her promise. 
&nbsp; �This cast looks different,� Danni said. 
&nbsp; �This is a fiberglass cast. It is lighter than the plaster.�
&nbsp; �But it is hard, isn&#8217;t it?� 
&nbsp; �Yes, you can touch it if you want to.�
&nbsp; Danni gingerly placed his hand on the knee portion of the cast. Watching her son curiously, Rachel pulled her hospital gown down some more. His hand rubbed the cast, then moved down toward her ankle. Rachel coughed. Danni startled and stepped back. 
&nbsp; �You should not have driven,� the boy said flatly.
&nbsp; �Why?�
&nbsp; �You were not supposed to drive with a cast on your leg.�
&nbsp; �The cast wasn&#8217;t a problem. I crashed because the brakes failed,� Rachel explained.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; Danni fixed his gaze on his mother, as though he wasn&#8217;t sure if she was telling the truth. His face paled. He had heard a strange noise in the garage the night before the accident, and he knew now what his father had done.
