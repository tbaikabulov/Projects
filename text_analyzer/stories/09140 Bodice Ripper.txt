Synopsis:  A bird in the bushes becomes one in the hands of her very kinky neighbors.






This is a fantasy, you should not try this stuff in real life. In real life people who do these things can get hurt, killed or locked away for a very long time.

The characters exist only in my imagination and any resemblance to persons living or dead would be coincidental and very creepy.


Robin Winter was terribly sad. She knew she had no right to be. She was 27, attractive healthy and had a job as a romance writer that had allowed her to purchase and renovate a cozy farmhouse on 5 acres. But as she drank her second glass of wine and watched a third car head down the little two lane road towards her only neighbors, the Blakes about half-a-mile further on, she still felt sad.

When the Blakes had moved in and started their own renovations about 6 months ago, she&#8217;d gone over with a bottle, some cheese and crackers; just to be neighborly.

They&#8217;d hit it off right away. Elizabeth Blake looked to be in her early 30&#8217;s but Robin was sure she was older. Her hair was still a raven&#8217;s wing black and she had a firm figure many 20 year olds would kill for. 

William. Never Bill and definably not Billy, He had to be mid 40&#8217;s if the distinguishing grey at his temples told Robin anything. He had to work out a lot considering how his pecs and arms strained his fashionable T-shirts. 

Despite the age difference they became close. When Elizabeth found out what Robin did she went out and bought all of Robin&#8217;s books. She would ask Robin probing questions about her process, especially the parts that Robin used to spice up her work. Robin always included at least one long chapter, sometimes more, where the heroine was captured, striped and tortured; sometimes she was sold into slavery, sometimes kept as the villain&#8217;s sex toy, but always rescued in the end. 

Robin was flattered by Elizabeth&#8217;s interest, but writing those particular scenes always made Robin uncomfortable, she&#8217;d always feel strangely aroused when imagining her heroine&#8217;s capture. Elizabeth seemed to sense this, but would keep probing anyway, and Robin didn&#8217;t want to hurt her new friend&#8217;s feelings. 

But all that changed two months ago. With the renovations finished Robin began to see cars headed down her little road to the Blakes. The only explanation was some sort of party to which she had not been invited. She still got together with the Blakes on other occasion, but always just the three of them. They never explained all the traffic on certain weekends and she never pressed the matter, fearing it would be rude, but it bothered her. Why would they exclude her when they&#8217;d gotten on so well? Were these older, more sophisticated friends and the Blakes were embarrassed by their acquaintance with someone so young and inexperienced? Her curiosity was such that on one occasion she took a midnight spin past their place. She spied half a dozen cars in front.&nbsp; The house was dark but she could just make out lights in the barn. She had nearly walked up pretending to drop by, but her nerve failed.

Now after watching the another car go by and with the first bottle of wine empty, Robin felt her sadness turn to anger. What was wrong with her anyway? She was smart, witty, attractive and damn good company. How dare they be afraid to introduce her to their other friends. 

Then an idea struck her. She&#8217;d see for herself what was so special about these gatherings. There was a hedgerow that blocked the view of the road from the barn and house. She could park her jeep there, and sneak up along the tree line to the barn. It was an old barn, there had to be a knothole of gap through which she could watch undetected. 

The wine and anger had quieted the part of Robin&#8217;s brain that might have told her what a bad idea this was, and so she slipped on her boots, grabbed her keys and headed out.

The moon was nearly full so Robin drove with her lights out. She parked behind the hedge, out of sight of the barn and began to sneak along the tree line, or as close to it as she could in her tipsy state. The adrenaline starting to pump, sobering her a bit but not enough to convince her to turn around and go home.

She saw no opening at the rear of the barn and began to move along the side away from the road, but in the moonlight. She was about to give up when she found a small hole and peered through. The light was too bright inside to catch anything clearly the first look, so she stood up and pressed her hand to her eye before trying again.

�See anything interesting?�

Robin froze at the sound of William&#8217;s voice behind her. But before she could react or try to explain she was slammed forward into the barn wall. The wind momentarily knocked out of her, she opened her mouth to scream, but as soon as she did a small rubber ball was forced between her teeth and tied tight. 

Robin began to panic and tried to struggle, but she was at an awkward angle and William was a great deal stronger. Then she felt the touch of metal close about her wrist; handcuffs!!! Before she knew it her hands were secured behind her back and then everything went black. Some sort of bag had been dropped over her head and was cinched at the neck. 

Robin was now terrified as she was half dragged, half propelled toward; what, she wasn&#8217;t sure but inside the barn was a safe bet.

When the voices she had heard from outside went silent, robin figured they were inside, then she was forced to her knees. 

�What have we here? � asked Elizabeth

�Well I was going to give you a piece of jewelry, but my dear it seems I caught you a much better gift. Happy Birthday!�

With that the bag was whipped of Robin&#8217;s head. Her mind already reeling with William&#8217;s words, she found herself blinking rapidly to clear her vision in the brightly lit barn. What she saw only served to increase her confusion. 

Directly in front of her sat Elizabeth on a chair that looked more like an electric chair than a throne. By Elizabeth sat with a regal air, wearing a bustiere that she seemed to be in danger of falling out of, a g-string and a pair of knee high boots. Around her stood about half a dozen people all wearing similarly black clothing, many of them in similar stages of undress. All save one who wore an incongruous white chef&#8217;s hat. 

Robin&#8217;s eyes grew wider as the reason became clear.&nbsp; A bit to his left a naked woman lay strapped to a gurney like table. One of the straps ran across her mouth holding an apple in place. What has she gotten herself into.

Robin shook her head to try to clear it, but this broadened her view of her surrounding and that didn&#8217;t help. The horse stalls had been turned into cages three of which were occupied; two by naked woman and the last by a naked man. Further back were all sorts of crossed and tables, another four of these also held bound, naked bodies.

�Well� Elizabeth purred �I suppose I should unwrap my gift.� 

Robin found herself being pushed onto her stomach. William quickly removed her boots and socks as Robin tried to kick and squirm.

�Angie� he called �give me a hand.�

To Robin&#8217;s terror a blond woman for whom the term Amazon seemed to be coined strode toward them.

The two got Robin to her now bare feet and propelled her forward until she stood between a pair of posts. As William held her still, Angie fitted a sort of harness over Robin&#8217;s head, which was then secured to the posts. Next her sweater was raised a bit and a belt with several rings on it was secured around her waist and tied to the posts. Finally cuffs were placed around her ankles and tied off. 

Robin now stood helplessly between the two posts and watched as Elizabeth approached her brandishing a pair of sewing sheers. Robin&#8217;s eyes widened and she did her best to plead through the gag for her friend not to do this to her. Elizabeth seemed to understand.

�Sorry sweetie� she said �but this is where the heroine suffers indignities. Try not to squirm, I really don&#8217;t want to injure you.�

Elizabeth pulled Robin&#8217;s sweater toward her, 

�I&#8217;m afraid a cable knit is more difficult to rip than a bodice, so we&#8217;ll have to do this the easy way.�

Elizabeth quickly cut the front of the sweater open. Then moving behind Robin, she cut the length of both sleeves and with a quick tug threw what was left on the floor. Likewise Elizabeth made quick work of Robin&#8217;s jeans. She stepped back to admire her work. 
�Tsk, tsk, this will never do Robin� Elizabeth said, �what were you thinking to go out like that.�

She had worn an old athletic bra and white cotton granny panties, never imagining anyone would see them. 

�Well there&#8217;s nothing for it� Elizabeth intoned, �they&#8217;ll have to go.�

With three quick snips Robin&#8217;s bra joined the rapidly growing pile. Her breasts were not particularly large, but they were well firm and pert. To her shock Elizabeth palmed each, jiggling them like she was weighting a melon. Elizabeth then lowered her head and ran her tongue around Robin&#8217;s nipples bringing each to attention; worse still Robin felt her juices begin to flow under Elizabeth&#8217;s sensual ministrations. 

�Well now for the bow� Elizabeth lilted. 

Robin tried to shake her head but was held tightly in place. She didn&#8217;t think it would have mattered, but felt she should make some protest. Elizabeth took her time in cutting away Robin&#8217;s panties, then nonchalantly tossed the rag aside. 

�Oh look&#8217; she enthused, �Robin&#8217;s a natural redhead�. Elizabeth rubbed her hand over Robin&#8217;s neatly trimmed pubic hair, and then favored Robin with a particular nasty leer. �And� she continued �she&#8217;s moist�. Elizabeth raised her fingers to she Robin that they glistened with her own juices; them licked her fingers clean, as if savoring a particularly rich dessert. 

Robin felt herself blush furiously. She closed her eyes briefly, hoping it would all go away. When she opened them, things had gotten worse. Elizabeth had laid aside her shears and replaced it with a bamboo cane. Elizabeth put her mouth against Robin&#8217;s ear and whispered.

�I&#8217;m sorry sweetie, this is going to hurt; but I think things will go easier afterwards.�

Robin tried to plead with her eyes and beg into her gag. Elizabeth either didn&#8217;t get it, or ignored her. 

The first few taps were light, almost massage-like, but Robin heard the rush of the wind and tensed as the cane struck her. Every nerve exploded as she strained against her bonds. The next two blows send Robin&#8217;s mind reeling into a world where nothing existed but the pain. The Elizabeth began the lighter taps once more.

�Was it over?� but Robin barely got the thought out before she heard the swish. She saw red as the pain once more flamed through her body. Another blow struck her and she screamed into her gag until she thought her throat would tear. 

As Elizabeth came back into her view Robin realized her beating really was over. 
�There, there, sweetie� Elizabeth cooed, as if to confirm. �all done.�

Elizabeth undid the harness that held Robin&#8217;s head in place and used a wet wipe to clean the tears and snot running down her face. She kissed Robin gently on the forehead.

Elizabeth cupped Robin&#8217;s chin meeting her eyes. �Now I don&#8217;t want to have to do that to you again tonight Robin, so you will behave.� 

Despite the fact that Elizabeth had made it a statement, Robin nodded vigorously in agreement; she really didn&#8217;t want Elizabeth to have to do that to her again either.

While Angie and William undid Robin&#8217;s bonds, Elizabeth affixed a slim collar around her throat and attached a leash to it. With some ceremony she led Robin back to the chair, and with a bit of help Robin was able to kneel by Elizabeth&#8217;s throne, �like a trained poodle� she thought.

�Time for the cake� announced William.

The reason for the girl strapped to the table became apparent as the large man in the white chef&#8217;s hat began to spread warm chocolate over her torso. He&#8217;d stop every once in a while to arrange fruit or candy in the chocolate. After he had finished, the chef used a cake decorator to create whip cream mounds over the girl&#8217;s breasts and topped each with a ruby red cherry. Finally he created a mound of whip cream over her navel, into which he placed one candle. He lit the candle and the assembled group, at least those without gags in their mouth, broke into an enthusiastic rendition of happy birthday.

Elizabeth tied Robin&#8217;s leash around the arm of the chair and rose gracefully, taking the acclamation as her due. She walked over to her living cake and with a quick puff blew out the candle.

�Did you make a wish?� Angie cried.

�Oh yes, indeed� Elizabeth replied and looked over her shoulder at Robin with a leer that made the younger woman shudder.

�First bite to the birthday girl� the chef intoned.

Elizabeth lowered her mouth over the girl&#8217;s whipped cream covered breast, licking, biting and teasing. The girl began to squirm under Elizabeth&#8217;s ministrations.

Finally Elizabeth turned to the company, looking a little ridiculous her face smeared with chocolate and cream. 

�Will my guests please join me?� She asked

With a cheer the other guests fell upon the living cake. No one used their hands, rather with tongues and teeth, they licked and pried away the covering sweets and excited the morsel beneath. 

Robin watched with fascination and her own growing excitement. She could feel the dampness between her legs increase. Twice she watched wide eyed as the captive on the table tensed and realized that Elizabeth&#8217;s cake was having an orgasm.

Eventually the strange dessert ended and the cake was released. Her chef helped her from the table as she seemed a bit wobblie. 

�Ladies and gentlemen� said William �a round of applause for Master Chef and Slave Dish.� 

There was a hardy cheer and the objects of admiration took their bows.

�And now� William continued �it is time for birthday licks.�

A young man was led forward he was naked and his hands were bound behind him. He knelt in front of Elizabeth and with a little help from her undid the bows with his teeth and removed her leather panties. He then began to perform cunnilingus. Robin watched with fascination as Elizabeth began to moan with pleasure. Even more amazing to her while this young man brought Elizabeth to orgasm, her husband watched without a trace of jealousy. In fact Robin thought he looked absolutely happy and something else that Robin preferred not to think about.

Once Elizabeth had relaxed and the man led away, William returned to his role as master of ceremonies. 

�And finally� He intoned �the untraditional birthday spanking.�

�Untraditional� Robin thought. She didn&#8217;t have long to see why. Instead of Elizabeth being placed across someone&#8217;s knee for a spanking, a naked woman was placed across hers. 

The woman was bound and foot and gagged. She squirmed as Elizabeth gently rubbed her hand over the woman&#8217;s behind, then Smack, �ONE� the assembled group cheered. Smack, �TWO�. 
Robin watched as the woman&#8217;s rear went from pale white, to rose pink and finally to a firey red. At 41, the spanking ended to a general cheer. 

�She won&#8217;t sit for a week� Robin thought. 

The spanking over, Elizabeth, now san her spankee, rose from her throne. 

�My dearest friends� she said ,�I am touched by this wonderful celebration, and I thank you. I know the hour is late but please feel free to avail yourselves of our little playspace before bed.�

With a final cheer Elizabeth&#8217;s guests began to scatter. Naked men and women were affixed to various tables, wooden crosses and other, stranger, pieces of equipment to be beaten, tortured and fucked.

At first Robin tried to take it all in, but eventually all her attention fixed on Angie. The beautiful blond was beating a woman tied to a cross. A flogger in each hand, her arms seemed to move in intricate patterns that Robin could barely follow. 

Robin was snapped out of her reverie by a sharp tug on her leash. Startled she turned to find both Elizabeth and William staring at her in a very predatory manner. 

�Come sweetie� said Elizabeth, �time to give your captor his reward.�

Robin felt a chill go down her spine, but bound, gagged, collared and leashed as she was, there was little choice but to follow where Elizabeth led her. 

Where she was led was a high table whose purpose was very apparent. Robin tried to struggle but she was so tired, hungry and scared at this point it wasn&#8217;t much of a fight. Within moments she was bent over with her upper body laying on the table surface. Heavy straps across her shoulders and back held her in place. Her legs were spread apart and her ankles cuffed to the table&#8217;s supports, her toes barely touching the ground. A slight curve in the tabletop lifted her ass slightly and left her sex obscenely exposed. 

The next thing Robin felt was soft fingers manipulating her clitoris and gently probing her virgina.

�Shall I get the lube?� asked William

�Not necessary dearest.� replied Elizabeth with a deep chuckle, �Our little Robin is quite prepared for you.�

It was true, everything Robin had seen and experienced that night had brought her to a high state of arousal. That her body should so betray her was one thing; that Elizabeth and William should learn about it was more humiliation than she thought she could stand.

Robin&#8217;s thoughts were interrupted by what could only be the tip of William&#8217;s cock penetrating her. She found herself responding as he inched himself deeper into her, taking his time and driving her to distraction. At one point, to her horror, she even wriggled her ass to tempt him into faster action. 

�My God� she thought, �how big could he be?�

Robin felt a sheen of sweat rise on her body. Then William rammed himself fully into her. She gasped as she felt the tip of his penis bounce off her cervix. It didn&#8217;t last long as a white light engulfed her followed by darkness.

When Robin next opened her eyes she found her self cradled in a pair of strong arms, her head resting against a nicely hard chest. Elizabeth&#8217;s face looked into hers with what seemed to be real concern. 

�Can you hear me Robin?� she asked, �Are you alright?�

Robin nodded, how could she tell Elizabeth what she didn&#8217;t understand herself. That she was better than alright, that she felt utterly well and safe. 

�Thank you.� Robin murmured as sleep claimed her. 


To be continued
















Bodice Ripper


Through the darkness Robin could hear a voice coming from what seemed like a great distance. 

�Wake up sleepyhead, we&#8217;ve a lot to do today.�

Robin could feel the blanket begin to slip from her body.

�Five more minutes Mom� she groaned. Then she made a grab for the receding blanket. When her arms failed to respond Robin&#8217;s eyes flew open. The reason that arms were not moving was instantly apparent. Her wrists were bound in soft leather cuffs and attached to the headboard of a strange bed in a strange room. Her friend Elizabeth sat on the bed&#8217;s edge in a pale yellow silk robe, one eyebrow elegantly arched. 

�Mom, huh� she said �You&#8217;ll pay for that young lady.�

Elizabeth smiled and continued to slowly draw the blanket from Robin&#8217;s naked body. Like a present being unwrapped.

�Present!� Robin gasped, �Elizabeth last night!�

Elizabeth lay a long manicured finger across Robin&#8217;s lips. 

�Hush� She commanded, �I am quite aware of what happened last night.� Elizabeth&#8217;s voice had taken on an edge.

�As you&#8217;ll recall, I was there, and what I recall is that you came to a party to which you were not invited.�

Robin blushed; after everything that happened last night why did she feel as if she was the one in the wrong?

�Elizabeth, I&#8217;m really, oooowww.�

Robin&#8217;s apology was cut short by a quick swat to her still sore bottom.

�However� Elizabeth continued �now is not the time to discuss it, and I want you to remain quiet. No speaking unless spoken too. Do you understand?�

Robin nodded and wished she could rub her butt. �Yes Elizabeth.�

�Mistress�

�Pardon?, owwww�
�Really Robin, you are the slow learner.� Elizabeth said. �You are to refer to me as Mistress and William as Master. Do you understand?�

This time Robin nodded, not wishing to make another mistake.

�Now� said Elizabeth, �My guests are getting ready to have breakfast before leaving. I could leave you here but I&#8217;ll bet you&#8217;re hungry by now.�

As if to confirm Robin&#8217;s stomach gave a loud growl. 

Elizabeth laughed, �Well that answers that� She declared. �Now can I trust you to behave, use the bathroom and take a quick shower, or shall I ask a couple of the boys to come up and help you?�

Elizabeth&#8217;s tone told Robin that whereas the boys would enjoy the experience, she would not. 

�I&#8217;ll behave�Mistress.� She responded.

�Excellent!� Elizabeth exclaimed and quickly undid Robin&#8217;s bonds. 

Robin&#8217;s arms and legs were asleep and she stumbled awkwardly to the bathroom, to use the toilet, to her horror Elizabeth strolled in a moment later with towels. As humiliating last night had been, no one had seen Robin pee since she learned to use the potty herself. 

�Hurry it along Robin� Elizabeth said, �I&#8217;m going to get dressed while you shower.�

Dressed thought Robin in a panic.

 �Uh..Mistress, &#8216;my clothing last night�� Robin stuttered.

�Don&#8217;t worry dear� Elizabeth smiled and ruffled the girl&#8217;s hair, �I&#8217;ll see to it. Now last warning, no more talking.� Elizabeth gave Robin&#8217;s hair a painful tug, and left.

Robin stepped into the shower, the hot water felt wonderful on skin. He indulged herself by using some of Elizabeth&#8217;s very expensive body gel. Try as she might to shut it out, her mind kept drifting back to the night before and her present predicament. She was essentially a naked captive, and she had done enough research for her books, to know what Elizabeth&#8217;s demand to be called mistress meant. She wasn&#8217;t a captive but a slave. Despite that she wasn&#8217;t really afraid, more nervous and humiliated. She couldn&#8217;t believe her friends would seriously hurt her, and she had to admit that she was even a bit aroused by the whole thing; that had never happened to any of her heroines.

Elizabeth&#8217;s voice cut through her reveries. �Step it up dear.� She called.

Robin regretfully got out of the shower and quickly toweled off. She walked out into the bedroom to find Elizabeth once more perched on the edge of the bed. She had put on a white linen blouse and matching pants that gleamed against her skin. Its cut showed off her figure to good advantage and its weave left little doubt that she wore nothing beneath.

Given her shower musings Robin was not surprised to see that Elizabeth held a set of leather cuffs, a collar and leash. 

�Time to get you dressed.� Her friend chirped. 

Robin sat quietly as Elizabeth fitted and lock soft leather around her wrists and ankles. She knelt without complaint and held her hair out of the way as Elizabeth affixed her collar and leashed her. 

�Come along� Elizabeth said, with a tug on Robin&#8217;s leash. There was no pain, the collar was snug but not tight, however it was a reminder of who was in charge.

Robin rose and followed along, breathing deeply and trying to concentrate and Elizabeth&#8217;s back and the feel of the plush carpet under her bare feet; anything to block out what was about to happen. 

�It won&#8217;t be that bad� Robin thought �There were plenty of naked people last night, this couldn&#8217;t be worse.� When the doors slid open, it was worse. Everyone in the room was dressed, some rather scantily but dressed none-the-less. Robin alone would be completely naked.&nbsp; Her feet froze in place. Elizabeth tugged on the leash but Robin could not bring herself to move. 

Robin expected swift punishment, instead Elizabeth reached out and gently rubbed Robin&#8217;s cheek. �There, there �she cooed, in a tone one might use with a frightened puppy. �It&#8217;s not so bad, and really dear, you have no choice in the matter.�

The full weight of the statement hit Robin. She did not have a choice. She was naked, leashed and quite sure that several of the people in the next room could easily subdue her should she make trouble. Anything that happened to her was completely in the hands of her captors. And deep at heart she trusted Elizabeth and William, didn&#8217;t she?

�I&#8217;m sorry Mistress� Robin said, �It won&#8217;t happen again.�

With a deep breath, Robin followed Elizabeth into the crowded room, she found it easier if she kept her eyes glued to the small of Elizabeth&#8217;s back. A round of applause greeted their entry. Robin wondered how long one could blush.

�There&#8217;s the birthday girl� William came forward pulling Elizabeth into a strong hug and deep kiss.

�And how did you sleep pet?� He asked Robin.
�Very well, Master.� She replied. William beamed at the use of his title.

�Why don&#8217;t you two sit down� he continued, �and I&#8217;ll get you some breakfast.�

Elizabeth crossed to the table and motioned for Robin to kneel beside her.

She watched as William and Slave Dish approached with plates laden with food. 

�For my lovely wife� said William as he laid Elizabeth&#8217;s plate and coffee in front of her.

Slave Dish knelt and put food, fork and a large glass of orange juice in front of Robin. �And for our new friend� she said, leaning over and giving Robin a kiss that was something more than friendly.

A day ago Robin would have been shocked, to say the least, if a friend had taken such liberties. Now it was becoming second nature and all she really wanted was to dig into her food, but something seemed wrong, she couldn&#8217;t put her finger on it. Robin looked at Elizabeth, sure she had the answer. 

�Go ahead sweetie, you can start.� Elizabeth said.

Yes Robin thought, that was it. She began to eat. How had this happened? Yesterday she had made a bold decision, today she was asking permission to eat when hungry. Perhaps it would be better to concentrate on eating right now.

When she had finished, Robin again looked to Elizabeth, waiting for; well she wasn&#8217;t sure what.

�All done dear?� Elizabeth asked, �Good, time to mingle. Hands behind your back.�

Robin knew what was coming; she didn&#8217;t know why, but that didn&#8217;t seem to matter and so she crossed her wrists behind her back and made no protest when Elizabeth clipped the leather cuffs together. Once again she was bound and helpless.

Elizabeth rose and with a tug on the lease indicated Robin should do likewise. It was hardly graceful after kneeling for sometime and with her hands bound. 

�Hmmm, we&#8217;ll have to work on that.� Elizabeth commented.

Work on it, thought Robin, exactly how long did Elizabeth expect this game to continue? Surely she&#8217;d release Robin at the end of the party.

And so mingle they did. At least Elizabeth did. Robin trailed behind her friend, eyes downcast. No one really spoke to her but they did touch her, stroke her, fondle her; much of it in an absent-minded way, almost as if she were an object or pet. The one time she did look up she found Angie looking at her in a very disconcerting way. Robin quickly lowered her eyes and kept them lowered.

As the morning wore on, people began to take their leave. At one point Angie came up behind her and enfolded her in leather clad arms, drawing Robin snuggly against her body and covering Robin&#8217;s breast with her hands. Robin yelped as Angie gave her a small nip on the neck.

�She tastes delicious� Angie declared. �Can I have her for a weekend?�

Much to Robin&#8217;s dismay, Elizabeth took time to think about it. �Not for a while� she finally said �There are things Robin needs to understand and get used too.�

�You know best� Angie said with a shrug. �Bye for now little one.�

With that Angie turned Robin around and kissed her deeply, forcing her tongue into Robin&#8217;s mouth. When she was done, Elizabeth received a final peck on the cheek and a final happy birthday before Angie left.

At last there was only one couple left. As Elizabeth spoke with them, William claimed Robin&#8217;s leash and led her down the hall to the library. Once there he had her kneel and locked her ankle cuffs together.

�You are to look forward only, do you understand.�

�Yes master� Robin responded, even she could hear the nervousness in her voice.

William did something behind her, when he returned he put one hand on her neck and forced her to bend forward to where her head nearly touched the floor. She felt something plastic and blunt moving against her nether lips and clenched up. William&#8217;s grip on her neck tightened and became slightly painful.

�Relax� he commanded, �it&#8217;s going in one way or the other, so make it easy on yourself.�

Robin forced herself to relax and what she assumed to be a dildo slid into place; assumed until William turned it on. 

�Now� he said, allowing Robin to return to a kneeling position, �You are to keep that vibrator in place and stay just as you are. If you move or it slides out there will be consequences.�

With that he left Robin to stew. She was already a bit excited from the morning&#8217;s activities and was certain if she orgasmed she would expel the monstrous device.&nbsp; On top of it all the bastard had set it on high.

Robin could only imagine what William had meant by punishment and for a bit that had helped her stay her growing climax, but soon it wasn&#8217;t enough. Robin could feel the sweat start to rise on her body. She tried to breath deeply, think of anything other than how much she wanted to cum. None of it helped for long, she squirmed as much as she could without losing her position. Finally she dug her nails into her palms and bit her lip, she tasted blood. 

Finally she heard the door open. 

�Well� Elizabeth said �very impressive Robin. Do you want me to remove the vibrator, or would you prefer to do it yourself.�

�Wa �what? I don&#8217;t understand�

Elizabeth knelt next to her and whispered, �I&#8217;m giving you permission to cum dear.�

Somewhere in her sex addled brain Robin understood. She exploded, trying to draw enough breath to scream, she found she couldn&#8217;t and then things went black.

Robin&#8217;s eyes fluttered open looking into Elizabeth&#8217;s very concerned face. She lay on her back with her head cradled in Elizabeth&#8217;s lap. She must have pasted out. La Petit Mort, the French call it. Leave it to the French to have a pretty way to say nearly killing yourself with sex.

Elizabeth smiled, �Are you alright Robin?�

�Yes� Robin croaked.

�Did you enjoy that?� Elizabeth asked.

This time Robin nodded. She closed her eyes and nestled her head more comfortably into Elizabeth&#8217;s lap.

�I&#8217;m glad dear, because I&#8217;ve decided to make amends for last night&#8217;s transgression, you&#8217;ll remain my slave for the next month.

Robin opened her eyes but couldn&#8217;t think of anything to say.

To be continued.
























Bodice Ripper part 3

Robin wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect from her new life as a slave girl, but routine wasn&#8217;t part of it. Yet there it was. 

She rose every morning at eight and disentangled herself from the sheets and usually from William and/or Elizabeth.

She padded down to the kitchen to start the coffee. She was as always naked, a fact that had long ago ceased to feel unusual to her. It was the few times she had worn clothes over the last month the felt odd.

Once the coffee was dripping and she had what she would need to make breakfast, she returned to the bedroom to deliver her owner&#8217;s wake up call.

Elizabeth was the deeper sleeper. If she was not on her back when Robin came to her, she would deliver a series of gentle kisses and bites to her mistress&#8217; buttocks until Elizabeth grudgingly turned and allowed Robin access to her cunt. Robin would then use her tongue, lips and fingers to gentle rouse her mistress, until Elizabeth orgasmed. 

Once she was done with Elizabeth, it was William&#8217;s turn. Robin knew William was a light sleeper, that and the erection he already had when she started led her to suspect his insistence on a �wake up call� was merely an excuse for an early morning blow-job. Still who was she to argue? She wrapped her mouth around his large organ and slowly pumped, stopping every now and again to flicker her tongue up and down his cock. She had discovered that gently scraping her teeth along the bottom of his organ elicited a delightful shudder in her master.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Next it was time to shower and Robin would be rewarded for her efforts. If she showered with William, she would wash him. Her ministrations would renew his erection and Robin would find herself wrapped around his torso as he held her against the wall and fucked her until she came moaning with delight. 

If she showered with Elizabeth, she would wash Elizabeth, after which her mistress would insist on retuning the favor, paying special attention to Robin&#8217;s breasts and vagina. However after a time she found even having Elizabeth work shampoo into Robin&#8217;s hair was a sensual act.

Once the shower was done Robin would towel off and head downstairs, often on wobblie legs to prepare breakfast.

In time Elizabeth and William, dressed and hungry would come down and she would serve them. Taking her plate last Robin would eat kneeling next to Elizabeth as she had that first day; however there were times she was invited to sit. The three of them would chat as if she&#8217;d dropped in that morning rather than being a naked prisoner. Her owners seemed to take this as if having a naked woman sitting at their table was a normal occurrence, perhaps it was. One day, after William had left the table, Robin asked Elizabeth about this.

�Well� her mistress started �this really isn&#8217;t new, it should be no shock that we&#8217;ve owned girls before you.� 

�Many?� Robin asked.

�Not so many, only two in fact. First there was Margaret. We met her at a BDSM club. With the right education she had a brilliant future ahead of her, but the money, even with scholarships wasn&#8217;t there. William and I arranged to put her through college and graduate school. In return she served as our slave during that time. It very satisfactory for all involved and today she&#8217;s done very well indeed, we&#8217;re rather proud of her.�

�And the second?�

�Ah, Gretchen, like you,� Elizabeth suddenly leaned forward and tweeked Robin&#8217;s nose, the shock almost cause the girl to fall out of her seat. �she stuck her pretty nose where it didn&#8217;t belong and was captured. But after a year we realized she wouldn&#8217;t meet our needs and we sold her.�

Robin was stunned, both by Elizabeth&#8217;s words and her nonchalant attitude.

�You can sell�people?� 

�Well not legally� Elizabeth acknowledged, �but it happens far more often than you might imagine.� 

Robin could think of a dozen questions to this response, but wasn&#8217;t sure she wanted the answer to any of them and let the matter drop.

After breakfast it was time for Robin&#8217;s training. 

Her first task was to learn how to kneel and rise gracefully with her wrists and elbows bound behind her. It was harder than she supposed and her butt was bright red from Elizabeth&#8217;s over the knee spankings but by the end of that afternoon she had it right. Then things got more difficult.

She would learn and hold a variety of postures, she was tied up and left that way sometimes for hours. After she mastered these skills, Elizabeth would leash her and take her out to the barn. Robin would find herself affixed to one of the crosses and beaten with a flogger, which she found highly erotic, or a single tail, which she did not. But the cane was still something she dreaded. The few times Elizabeth used it Robin was reduced to tears after just two or three blows. 

Robin&#8217;s lessons in the barn always ended the same way; with her strapped to the fucking table, her butt in the air and her sex obscenely exposed. Elizabeth would then lube her up and use a strap on to take Robin anally. Robin had almost no anal experience and hated it the first couple of times, but Elizabeth had used a small dildo to penetrate her and it wasn&#8217;t so bad. However after about three days Robin realized Elizabeth was using a somewhat larger dildo. It became clear to her she was being stretched to accommodate William. 

Despite making good use of her mouth and vagina, William had never used her anus. Robin understood that her owners didn&#8217;t want her damaged. For some reason the fact that they&#8217;d go to so much trouble and William would wait made her feel good.

After morning training Robin made and served lunch. William would join them after caring for the couple&#8217;s investments from his home office. 

William was generally in good spirits when he joined them but one afternoon he marched into the kitchen and announced, �Need to fuck!�

He grabbed Elizabeth by the waist and hoisted her over his shoulder. He then turned and marched towards the guest rooms at the back of the house, Elizabeth laughing and ineffectually beating his broad back.

Robin set the lunch to warm and sat to wait for her owners to return. She wondered if her presence would disrupt the loving relationship William and Elizabeth shared, and was glad it didn&#8217;t seem to. Robin&#8217;s own relations were never that close. Her parents were supportive and she supposed loving, but aloof. Her friendship never seemed that deep and her two romances had been disasters. Perhaps that was why she was drawn to the warmth that her owners seemed to radiate.

A few days later, William again entered the kitchen announcing �Need to fuck�. Robin sighed and went to lower the heat on lunch. She was surprised when William spun her around and lifted her over his shoulder. Her squeal earned her a slap on her rear. He turned and headed down the hall.

William slammed open the door of the first bedroom and without ceremony dropped Robin on the bed. When he said fuck, he meant just that. He dropped his pants and spread Robin&#8217;s legs, entering her with further ado. Fortunately Robin was already wet and ready for a bit of fucking herself. What a little slut I&#8217;ve become, she thought.

After lunch Robin sat in front of her laptop and wrote, under Elizabeth&#8217;s watchful eye. Robin had never been able to keep to a schedule and Elizabeth did her best to impose order without dampening creativity. But Robin noticed that she made her deadlines and she was not alone, her editor Linda was thrilled by the new Robin. Little could Robin tell her that if she finished sufficient pages she was rewarded with an orgasm under Elizabeth&#8217;s ministrations. Should she fail she&#8217;d wear nipple clamps for an hour.

One day Robin found herself blocked. Even the nipple clamps failed to inspire her. 

�I&#8217;ve an idea� Elizabeth said, �Come with me.�

Elizabeth led Robin up to the master bedroom. She opened a large walk in closet and plunged within. She emerged a moment later and handed Robin a tangle of cloth. 

�Put these on and wait here� Elizabeth commanded, �I need to arrange something and will be right back.�

With that her mistress practically skipped through the door and was gone. Robin dutifully put on what turned out to be a long print skirt with an elastic waistband, a white off the shoulder blouse and an honest &#8211;to-goodness bodice, made of a flimsy black material. Where had Elizabeth gotten these? Robin wondered. These were hardly Elizabeth&#8217;s style.
She had little time to ponder this mystery when Elizabeth returned.

�Come along girl� Elizabeth ordered.

She took Robin by the hand and led her to the back garden.

�Now walk toward the shed, things will become clear.�

Following Elizabeth&#8217;s instructions Robin walked, it was a beautiful day, and wonderful to be outside anyway. No clouds overhead, not to hot and the grass felt wonderful beneath her bare feet.

Her reverie was interrupted when William stepped from behind some trees and into her path. He wore riding pants and boots and a plain white shirt open near to his navel. In his right hand he carried a nasty looking riding crop. 

�He could be on the cover of one of my novels� Robin thought. With a start Robin realized what Elizabeth&#8217;s idea was to get her over her writer&#8217;s block; a scene from a romance.

�Well, Well� William sounded menacing �this is private property girl and you&#8217;re trespassing.�

Robin stifled a giggle and fell into her best curtsey.

�I&#8217;m sorry sir, I&#8217;ve become lost in the hedgerows and did not know. If you could direct me to the road I would be most grateful.� 

Not much could be said for her acting abilities, but she hoped she sounded contrite and a bit frightened. She could feel her excitement begin to rise.

�Not so fast my girl.� William drawled, �There are penalties for trespassing.�

With that he grabbed Robin roughly by the hair and dragged her to a nearby log. Sitting he pulled her over his knee and flipped her skirt up.

�No Please!!!� she screamed �Please don&#8217;t, I&#8217;ve done no harm!!!�

Her fright was not completely feigned as it became all to clear that the riding crop was not just costuming. William wielded the crop with an expertise. By time he pushed her off his lap her sniffles were very real. 

Rubbing what she was sure was a very pink ass, Robin rose to go.

�Not so fast my beauty� William said, roughly pushing her back onto the ground. �You&#8217;ve paid the penalty, but there is also a toll.�

With that he seized the flimsy bodice and ripped it open. Her blouse followed as he pushed her onto her back and easily slipped off her skirt.

She affected the maiden about to be ravished pose, placing the back of her hand daintily against her forehead. 

�Please sir, no!! I&#8217;m a good girl.�

With that she did giggle and could hear Elizabeth&#8217;s less dignified laughter behind her. 

She gasped as William cupped her still sore butt and entered her in one smooth motion. 

�Robin� William hissed in her ear, �You&#8217;re supposed to resist.�

Robin was too far gone to do much. 

�Cad� she moaned, �Brute� 

After that she gave up on acting her part and hooked her legs behind William&#8217;s back abandoning herself to her pleasure. She clamped down and buried her head into William&#8217;s shoulder as she climaxed. William finished just a moment or two behind her. 

She looked up into William&#8217;s smiling face with half shut eyes. 

�Thank you master.� She said.

�Trust me pet, my pleasure.�

�Brava, well done.� Said Elizabeth as she came to sit next to them in the grass. �And now, any ideas where your story should go?�

To Robin&#8217;s surprise after a moments thought, she did.

�Yes mistress� she responded. �Thank you as well.�

�Almost a pity� said Elizabeth, affecting a pout. �If this didn&#8217;t work it was my turn and I have a French maid&#8217;s costume that would look wonderful on you.�

Robin imagined herself in a little black dress and lacy apron. 

�Perhaps� she said �I could be blocked again tomorrow.�

After dinner one, the other or both of her owners would claim her body for sex. Sex beneath the stars, sex bound to some piece of equipment in the barn or furniture in the house. Robin could swear she had been used on every inch of the property. It was as if William and Elizabeth were insatiable and she had to admit she was fast becoming a bit insatiable herself. But where ever she had sex and with whom, all three of them ended together in the large bed in the master bedroom.

The patterns broke on the last day of her captivity. As she rose to make coffee William grabbed her arm and dragged her back into the sheets, using her until they both came. When she retuned from the kitchen William was already in the shower leaving only Elizabeth to receive her wake up.

After breakfast Elizabeth announced she was returning to bed. She slid her finger into the ring of Robin&#8217;s collar.

�And I&#8217;m taking you along to make sure I don&#8217;t get bored.�

Upon arriving Elizabeth dropped her robe and dragged Robin into the bed, she ordered her to remain still, while Elizabeth once more explored every inch of her possession with lips and tongue and fingers. Robin gasp as her mistress slipped one then two fingers into her, playing with her until Robin was moaning and begging for relief. After she allowed Robin to climax, Elizabeth lay back among the pillows.

�I&#8217;m becoming bored.� Elizabeth said.

�Yes mistress�, and with a smile Robin spent the rest of the morning amusing her.

After lunch it was William who needed amusement until he drove to town for Chinese food.

Robin took a brief nap and after dinner a long luxurious bath with Elizabeth. When they were done Elizabeth dressed in the leather outfit she&#8217;d worn when Robin first saw her in the barn. Robin wore only collar and cuffs. Elizabeth locked Robin&#8217;s wrists behind her back and gagged her. She then added one last touch, a long white cloak with gold trim.

�A fitting offering� Elizabeth said as she drew Robin&#8217;s leash to her and led her to the barn.

The barn was brightly lit and William was waiting for them there. He wore only a leather loincloth and executioner&#8217;s mask. 

Elizabeth and William kissed as she presented him with Robin&#8217;s leash. He led Robin over to stand between the posts where her adventure in slavery had started. Robin stood still and tall as William removed her cloak and bound her between the posts. Elizabeth approached her bearing the dread cane. 

�This is going to suck� she thought.

Robin heard the cane swish through the air, there would be no gentle taps this time, no warm-up and Robin did her best to prepare herself.

The first blow seemed to send pain shooting through every nerve ending in her body. Robin shut her eyes and screamed inwardly, but she did not flinch, she would not.

The second blow was every bit as bad. Elizabeth was allowing just enough time for the pain to begin to subside so each strike would give maximum pain. 

By the third blow she was screaming into her gag and by the fourth biting into it. At the fifth Robin&#8217;s tears were flowing freely, but she had stood still, she hadn&#8217;t flinched and felt proud. 

�Well done� said Elizabeth as she leaned in and licked the tears from Robin&#8217;s face. 

William unhooked Robin from the posts and led her to the fucking table. Robin bent over and allowed Elizabeth to strap her down. 

She felt a prodding at her anus and then cold, Elizabeth was using a lube shooter to fill her up. 

�Breath deep� she thought �don&#8217;t clench.�

She gasp as she felt the tip of William&#8217;s penis begin to slowly work its way into her. He&#8217;d move out then deeper into her, slowly. Robin thought he was going to split her in half. Robin once again clamped down on her gag, knowing William would not climax quickly and her ordeal would not end soon. 

After what seemed to her like days, William did explode within her and to her relief withdrew from her much abused anus. Robin could only imagine what this would have been like with Elizabeth&#8217;s preparations. 

Robin was proud of the fact that once released she could stand up on her own, although her legs felt a bit wobblie she felt she could be led back to the house. It wasn&#8217;t necessary; Elizabeth wrapped Robin in her cloak and William gathered her into his arms and once more carried her back to the house. 

�We&#8217;re so proud of you.� He whispered.

Once back Robin was taken to one of the guest rooms and divested of her cloak, cuffs and collar and gently put to bed.

�William stopped at your place and picked up some clothes for you.� Elizabeth told her. �Sleep as late as you want then shower and dress and we can drive you home.�

They turned out the lights and quietly left the room. 

Robin was exhausted but there, alone in the darkened room, sleep would not come. She should be happy to return to her own house, shouldn&#8217;t she? Elizabeth had assured her their friendship would continue, Robin would even receive invitations to the parties in the barn. When she first met the Blakes their connection seemed so deep, so strong in so short a time. Robin knew immediately she wanted something from them. At the time she thought it was friendship, but now perhaps it was something else, something more, could she actually use the term love in this situation?

Eventually sleep took her, but it was fitful and her dreams were troubled.

Robin awoke with a start, her body covered with sweat from a nightmare whose details were fading but whose terror remained. She was groggy and vaguely aware something was wrong. She looked at the clock by the bed stand. The LED display showed 8:20, the coffee she thought, that must be it, I&#8217;m late.

She nearly fell getting out of bed, dragging the sheets and blanket that had twisted around her. In her haste she left them piled in the hallway and dragging herself into the kitchen. What she saw brought her up short. William and Elizabeth sat at the table in their robes; their morning coffee before them. 

�Robin� Elizabeth said with some surprise in her voice, �Up already and not dressed?�

�Let her be� William chimed in, with a smile. �She still looks half asleep. I&#8217;ll get you some coffee Robin and you can dress afterwards.�

Robin watched as William got up to serve her. No she thought this is wrong, this isn&#8217;t how it is supposed to be.

She started to tell them so but instead burst into tears, deep sobs wracking her body.

Within moments she was encircled by silk clad arms as Elizabeth drew her in and lay Robin&#8217;s head on her shoulder. 

�Robin, whatever is wrong?� She said, stroking Robin&#8217;s hair and trying to comfort her. �Please sweetheart, please stop crying.�

But Robin couldn&#8217;t and Elizabeth&#8217;s concern made it worse. It seemed like an eternity before she could ask the question she wanted.

�Why� she choked. �Why are you sending me away?� She knew it didn&#8217;t make sense but it was all she could think of.

�But Robin, we&#8217;re not sending you anywhere. We&#8217;re taking you home.�

Robin realized that was wrong, she was home, she was where she needed to be.

�But I don&#8217;t want to go.� She said �I love you both.�

Elizabeth cupped her chin and forced Robin&#8217;s head up. She wore a smile so enigmatic it made the Mona Lisa look like an open book. 

�Wash your face.� Elizabeth told her �I&#8217;ve something to show you.�

Robin was confused but did as she was told. After she had washed in the kitchen sink and dried her face, Elizabeth took her by the hand and led her to the library, William coming close behind them. 

On the desk lay a single sheet of printed paper, an old fashioned fountain pen and a delicate gold choker. 

�Read� Elizabeth commanded. 

Robin began to scan the page. It was a slave contract; in it she agreed to turn over complete control of her body and her life to Elizabeth and William Blake. 

�There&#8217;s no end date.� She said.

�No� William replied �And if you hadn&#8217;t notice there&#8217;s a no sale clause. Once you sign we&#8217;re stuck with you forever.�

Elizabeth laid her hands on Robin&#8217;s shoulders, looking deeply into her eyes.

�Silly girl� she said �Did you honestly think we&#8217;d let you go? We love you as well and want to own you for the rest of our lives.�

Robin released a breath she hadn&#8217;t been aware of holding. She didn&#8217;t know weather to laugh, cry or sing. Instead she simply said; 

�Where do I sign.�
