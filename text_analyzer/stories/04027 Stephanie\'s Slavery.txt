Chapter 1. Sacked
"He's done it again!" Stephanie spoke loudly to the others in the office, "Thirty-five minutes to knocking off time on a Friday and he presents me with a couple of hour's work! And I don't suppose any of you lot will volunteer to help." No one moved. No one said a word. "I thought not. Just because I'm a supervisor, I'm treated like a chattel! Here Miss Jones, can you just produce 500 copies of this document before you go! He's nothing more than a tyrant who thinks I'm his slave. David Benson, master slaver who�" Stephanie stopped in mid sentence when she realised everyone was not looking at her but at a point to one side. Not only that, they were trying to hide their giggles. She turned and saw her boss, the object of her derision, standing in the open doorway.
"Miss Jones, perhaps next time you decide to give vent to your feelings in this way, you had better check that the intercom is switched off." Looking at the console, Stephanie saw to her horror that the switch had not returned itself to the off position. It had been sticky for a week or so and she'd had to manually push it back. When her boss called her in earlier, she'd forgotten. "Not that you'll need to worry over that any more Miss Jones, this is your last few minutes working for me." Turning to one of the other ladies he went on, "Barbara will you please sort out how much pay we owe Miss Jones including any in lieu of notice and see that it is sent to her home address first thing on Monday."
"Yes sir."
"Thank you Barbara and can we do without the Sir business now Miss Jones is leaving. We can go back to being on first name terms please. Miss Jones, please clear your desk and leave us." There were murmurs of approval from the other girls in the room. They had suffered too often from her sharp tongue. 
"She might be efficient and knowledgeable on office routine but she's so unpleasant with it that no one works as willingly as they should," Kelly mentally commented.
Stephanie was by turns angry and alarmed. She knew none of them liked her but didn't think that they would wish her sacked in such an ignominious way. After all she was sticking up for them too. If she weren't here to do it, they would have to get the work out themselves. "Why sir?" she questioned, "I'm sure others have said similar or worse things to you."
"Not with such hatred. Until I appointed you, we were a happy group of workers, almost a family. When jobs like this came up, everyone mucked in. With the kind of work we do, there are going to be periods when rush jobs come in at the last moment and the theatre this is for is one of our best customers. If we disappoint them, we lose their work and we go downhill. I rashly appointed you when we were short staffed, over worked and Kelly was ill. Well I'm letting you go now and if she wants the job, Kelly can take over your responsibility. So please clear your desk. Your employment with us is terminated as of now."
"Sir, won't you please reconsider�" Stephanie started her eyes running with tears.
"Reconsider taking on someone who considers herself to be a slave, Miss Jones?"
"I'm sorry sir. Please I need this work."
"Your slave work. Miss Jones? The work you thought of as slavery? No Miss Jones, I will only think of reconsidering if you were to agree to become a real slave, a 24/7 slave, a slave twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. A real slave who commits herself wholeheartedly to her master and is willing to submit herself to him, body and soul. That's what I would call slavery. Real slavery." 
Stephanie stood open mouthed in shock at his words. "Did he really expect her to give herself to him totally? Would he expect her to give her body to him? Would he want to punish her?" Her musing was interrupted by comments from the others as to what she might be expected to do but she hardly heard them. Fury raged within her. "You just want an unpaid whore!" she spat at him.
"No, I would pay the wages you are getting now because you would be working here as well as at my home, so to that extent you wouldn't be a real slave because they don't get paid at all."
"You're just a pervert. You don't really expect me to agree to those outrageous terms, do you?"
"No. I don't. Which is why I offered them to you. Now clear your desk please Miss Jones, we have work to do. I don't wish to see you here again," David laughed, "&#8211; unless of course you decide to be my fulltime slave. If that is your wish, come in on Monday with your stuff in a suitcase and ready and willing to be punished for this afternoon's outburst and ready and willing to move in with me and do my bidding, however perverted you might consider it to be."
"You cannot be serious, Mr. Benson. No one these days could accept those terms."
"So you look for another job. Now hurry along, we've still this order to get out."
It took a few more minutes to persuade Stephanie to leave and while she was clearing her desk, David addressed the five girls working for him. "Ladies, can I have three volunteers to help get this job done. I'll work with you. If necessary I could try and do it myself, but with my lack of skills on the machines it would take me the whole evening, and then we would miss the deadline anyway. It's a theatre programme and they've had to change tonight's show because the main entertainer is ill and they've brought in a last minute replacement. You are all so much more competent on the equipment than I am so I would really appreciate your help co-operation."
Kelly stood up. "After what you just did David, I think we are all willing to stay. Tell me what the order is and I'll get the big machine set up." Five minutes later it chugged away, feeding paper into itself and spewing it out into various racks. Nothing more could be done until it finished its work. David set the coffee machine going and while they sat around drinking David thanked each of them for their support. First he went to Kelly Harmsworth his new supervisor. At 22 she was smart, efficient and knew the working and idiosyncrasies of the more complex copiers and printers. Had he been younger, he might have made a play for her but he knew she was already engaged and expected to marry in a year or so. "Thanks for taking the job, Kelly. It should have been yours months ago. I really don't know why I kept her on."
Stella Mitchell sat at her computer although it was shut down. Stella, 26 years old attractive, if a little plump, wore outrageous clothes but was an excellent artist and mainly employed to design artwork on computer. "You don't have to stay Stella if you wish to get away. There's no artwork needed for this job."
"I know but I may be able to help with something. It's such a relief not to have her carping at us. Not that she could do much to me. Certainly she had no understanding for graphics but she did try my patience when she wanted things done that are impossible on the computer."
"And I'm not much better," David laughed.
"No, but I can tell you without getting abused for incompetence," Stella laughed with him. "If she'd have been here much longer you would have been looking for another graphic artist."
Tracy is 22 and very attractive and had a succession of boyfriends but so far nothing seemed to last. She mainly worked on front desk but acted as general dog&#8217;s body when they are busy. There was no real reason for her to stay either but she guessed there would be more comments on 'the Stephanie Jones affair' and she wanted to be in on them and wanted to feel that she was part of the 'family' again. Besides she had her eye on her boss as a possible prospect, even though she knew he was old enough to be her father &#8211; well almost. David thanked her for her support.
"That can wait until Monday Barbara. No need to do it now," David suggested to the middle-aged accounts secretary.
"It's okay, I'll get her pay sorted out on computer and if she does turn up on Monday, I can just delete it. Do you think she will?" 
"No. I'm pretty sure that's the last we'll see of her. I can't imagine a woman who hasn't shown any interest in sex or men at least while we've known her, coming to live with me as a slave. She's been used to bossing others around rather than being the bottom of the pile. I really only said it as a joke and it sort of escalated."
"I think she might," Polly interceded. Polly at eighteen years old was the youngest member of the workforce. In many ways she wasn't the brightest of girls but she had a knack of blocking wads of paper and binding them quicker than any of the other girls could. She had a pleasant smile and was the only one that Stephanie talked to.
"Why's that Poll?" David asked, surprised at the remark.
"She needs the money for a new car. She can walk here, or even from your house because I doubt you would bring her on the crossbar of your bike! If she gets a job elsewhere she'll need to get a bus or have her own car. It's rare for any similar jobs to come up in this area and the only other jobs nearby are in the stores and supermarkets and I know she doesn't think much of them. Most other similar jobs to hers are on the new industrial estate the other side of town and those jobs don&#8217;t come up very often." 
"Yes, but if she just needs a job for money, she'll take anything until she gets her car. She wouldn't allow herself to be a slave to me for a few extra pounds."
"No, you're probably right, but I think there is more to it than that, I think she might be looking for someone. She's a very lonely woman but she's too proud or shy to go out and look for a man or even let one get close to her. With her bad temper it probably wouldn't last long anyway. If she became your slave she wouldn't have to make the choice but I reckon she'll resist and kick against you. Will you really take her in as a slave if she does turn up on Monday, David?"
"I guess I'll have to. Can't have you lot laughing at me behind my back!" Everyone laughed and joked about what he would have to do to keep the bitch under control. By six o'clock the work was finished and Tracy delivered the order on her way home.

Chapter 2. The debates
David lay naked on top of the bed his mind churning over the events of earlier in the day. Lying with his eyes closed and a plastic masturbater humming and gently gnawing on his prick and allowing his thoughts free reign he asked himself, "I wonder if Polly is right? She's a perceptive kid even if she isn't too bright in other ways. We all laugh at her spelling and the way she writes but she's good at what she does and seems to understand people better than I do. I couldn't even understand Lisa and I was married to her for twelve years until that ended in divorce five years ago. She's better off married to that wealthy London broker who enjoys taking her to shows and expensive restaurants in town. They're all things that don't appeal to me. She didn't like my mates in the cycling club either. I haven't had many women since. Bloody recriminations as the divorce went through put me off women. Don't know if I'll ever get involved again. Certainly not with that unpleasant, bossy bitch, Stephanie Jones. Perhaps though if she really submits herself and I get to thrash her a couple of times� No, she'd sue me for assault or sexual harassment or something. Be nice to have her over my knee though and spank her bony arse. Bet there's not much padding on it. She always looks like she needs a good meal. Bet her cunt is tight. Wonder if she's a virgin? A virgin at 32? I doubt it, but she&#8217;s not had anyone for the whole time I've employed her and she never speaks of any previous relationships." For a while his mind returned to the early days of his marriage when he and Lisa would lie side by side and fondle each other after making love. "How did that all go so wrong?" he asked the mermaid sculpted on the masturbater. 
"What will I do with her if she does turn up on Monday? Can't very well tell her to piss off home after what I said in front of the girls and what they suggested I should do. She's probably agonising over what to do right now and if she comes in on Monday then she would have decided on the slavery option. How do I handle that? I wouldn't mind giving her a good thrashing. She's hardly treated me as her boss ever since she started work here. I'd like to pay her back for that. I've fantasised often enough about having a slave and read enough stories on the net but this would be reality. In my fantasy world I know what I would do. I'd make her strip off in my office and then inspect her to see if she was as titless as her dresses make her look. I might even be able to do that for real. In my fantasy she'll really be a virgin of course and humiliated at having to show me her naked body. The humiliation would be so great she'd resist and I, like some powerful eastern potentate, would order another slave to hold her down while I whipped her arse until she begged for mercy and pleaded me to do what I would with her body. I wouldn't stop until I thought she'd had more than enough." David's mind clearly saw a naked Stephanie, held tightly over his desk, her buttocks criss-crossed with livid red stripes and he heard her pleading for him to stop and apologising over and over again for her behaviour. "Under the watchful eye of my slave, I'd grip her arse and roughly push the welted bottom cheeks apart and force my rampant prick against her tight brown hole. That sounds more like a dramatic scenario I once read. I've never fucked an arse before, but often wished to try it. Lisa wouldn't allow it. It will of course be painful and she'll cry out when I thrust my manhood into her and fuck her hard. I'll ignore her screams and anguished begging and carry on until I shoot my load inside her bowels." The vision aroused him greatly and he spurted into the masturbater. Switching the machine off, his mind returned to reality. He knew that in this day and age he would never get away with whipping anyone, nor did he really believe he would hurt anyone, not even the Stephanie bitch, as badly as his imagined scenario.
"I doubt she'll turn up anyway. But what will I really do if she does? What will the other girls do? They've been used to her bossing them around and bitching at them. They'll probably want to give her some stick now they have the upper hand. How will she react to them taking the piss? That could lead to as much unpleasantness as we had before. I daren't whip or cane her and leave marks that she could show the police. Spanking would probably be okay, maybe even a strap or the slipper. Much will depend on her willingness to go along with the slavery thing. She could decide to pack it in after only an hour and if I sack her, she could then go to an industrial tribunal and claim unfair dismissal or something. Wish I hadn't started this whole thing. It was only intended as a joke. Maybe she'll find another job."
Half a mile away in a one bedroom flat, Stephanie too lay thinking in her bed. "What are you going to do Steph? There weren't any jobs you fancied in the evening paper and you can't allow yourself to be a slave to that bastard David Benson can you? Especially with all those other tarts knowing. They'll deliberately go out of their way to make your life hell. Still you need the money girl and he pays quite good wages for the work we do. It's not a bad job, or rather, it wasn't a bad job until you opened your big mouth. There's a variety of work to keep us interested. Why on earth did you not switch the stupid intercom off? What will he expect me to do as a slave? Sounded like I would have to sleep with him. Or more crudely he'll want to fuck me. Could I allow that? No, not willingly. Will he make me do other sexual things? Like sucking him? Or doing it in my bottom? Some of my love story novels have mentioned that. Bet that hurts. He said he'd punish me for my outburst. That was stupid of me. Why didn't I keep my mouth shut? The girls all seemed willing enough to help him get the order out when I was leaving. Why did they not want to help me? Just because I'm more efficient? Or they don't like the way I chivvy them into getting the work done? Don't they realise I have to be the one in control and you can't do that by being nice now, can you? Don't kid yourself Steph. They hate your guts. They'll treat you like shit if you go back as a slave. How will he punish me? A spanking? In front of the others perhaps? On my bare bum? Or perhaps he wants to cane me over his desk, like a naughty schoolgirl. Doubt he would be foolish enough to hurt me too much or leave marks. He'd know I could go to the authorities. I daresay he'll try and humiliate me as much as possible. Maybe he'll want to provoke another outburst so he can give me another thrashing. Still it may not come to that. I'll look in the ad's again tomorrow and perhaps there'll be another job going. Will he give me a decent reference though? He didn't sound all that pleased with me this afternoon, not just because I called him a slave driver, more because he thought I'd soured the atmosphere in the office. Probably with me there, he could not get to have sex with some of the girls. I know that Tracy wants to get into his pants. I wonder what it would be like to have sex with him? Perhaps he would tie me down like the slave he imagines me to be and then rape me. Except I supposed it wouldn't be construed as rape as I would have consented to go with him as his slave. Except slavery is illegal these days so I would have gone voluntarily as his mistress. How long would I be a slave for? He didn't give a time limit. Perhaps until I got enough money for a car or could get another job. I wonder what his penis is like? I've only done it twice and then that Reggie Harris called me a flat-chested little bitch and dumped me. He only wanted to have sex with me and when he'd done it twice he wanted another girl, one with more tits. That's what's put me off men for all these years." With a jumble of random thoughts chasing themselves around Stephanie's brain, she was a long time getting to sleep.
On Sunday morning, Stephanie sat at the breakfast table crying onto the open newspaper in front of her. Her morning coffee stood alongside, untouched and cold. She scanned the adverts for the twentieth time but there were no jobs she thought suitable. Indeed there were very few office type jobs at all. Most of the work available was for unskilled manual workers at the chicken packaging factory or the freezer processing plant. There was one job she fancied in the Employment Bureau list yesterday but when she enquired the assistant remarked, "I'll give you the application form but the advert has been out for over a week and there have been a lot of people after that job." Without a really good reference from David she knew she would not get to the interview stage even if someone hadn't already been appointed. Stephanie folded the newspaper and pushed it aside. "No good sitting here and crying," she scolded herself, "Go for a walk, maybe it will clear the cobwebs away and give you a clearer idea of what to do."

"You all right Miss Jones?" Stephanie looked up from her seat in the park. Isolated teardrops trickled down her cheek. Polly and a large boy stood in front of her. The boy was smiling and had one arm round Polly's waist and in the other he held a canvas bag. "You go on to the bowling club Pete, I'll catch you up in a minute," Polly told the boy. He kissed her affectionately, gave her a pat on the arse and said, "See you later. Don't be long Poll, I need you as my mascot for the competition. You bring me luck." Pete kissed her again and with a little wave, carried on down the path. A pang of jealousy went unplanned through Stephanie. No one ever treated her in an affectionate way. No one had ever loved her, not even her own mother. Another teardrop coursed down her cheek.
"You're worried about what happened on Friday? You're worried about this slave thing?" Polly questioned as sat alongside Stephanie.
Stephanie nodded. "There's no other jobs at the moment." It always surprised her how easily she could talk to Polly. It was not so much what the girl said but the way she said it and the expression of concern on her face. The girl had an open frankness that she knew she could trust. Quite unlike the other girls, whom she felt had hidden meanings behind their words.
"You're considering David's option then?" Again Stephanie nodded. "And you're worried sick about what he might do to you?"
"Not just Mr. Benson. It's how all the girls in the office will treat me as well. They'll enjoy sniping at me and making me feel about so high." Stephanie indicated the distance by the small gap between her thumb and forefinger. "I just know they will try and wind me up."
"I'm sure there'll be some of that Miss Jones, - can I call you Stephanie now we're not at work?" Stephanie murmured, "Please do," and Polly went on, "I may be wrong but I don't think David would allow that to go on for too long provided you don't start abusing them over it. I hope you won't mind my saying this Stephanie, but you were not the most popular member of staff at Kwikprint so I guess Kelly and the others will want to get back at you but I know David hates bickering women and he's told us off before. He did it when I first came and they took the piss out of me because I can't spell properly." Stephanie wondered if she could stand the girls 'taking the piss' out of her for even a short period but said nothing. She'd think about it when she was alone again.
"As to what David will do is anyone's guess. I don't think he'll be deliberately cruel to you. The girls joked about how he would punish you when we did the order on Friday but he didn't say much. I know what you said offended him but I'm sure you won't be thrashed or anything bad. I know that after his wife left him, he hates bossy women so probably what you said made him feel worse. It seemed to me from what he said after you'd gone, that he expected his offer to take you as a slave to be a joke but when the other girls took it seriously, he took it seriously too. Will you really object to sleeping with him? To him fucking you?" Polly always used down to earth language.
Stephanie blushed and Polly started to apologise but Stephanie stopped her. "It's all right Polly. It's something I have to face up to if I decide to take the slave option. I really don't know the answer. I've never slept with a man although I suppose I've thought about it but I've never taken a fancy to anyone in that way."
"I know I'm different to you Stephanie, and as you know I've had several boyfriends over the last few years. Pete's my latest and I sleep with him most weekends." Polly said that as a pure statement of fact. "I love him fucking me. I love it when we are so close you couldn't get a fag paper between us. It makes us feel together and in love. I guess you don't have that experience and I don't know if you will get it with David, but you won't know unless you give it a whirl. What is the alternative? To become a crotchety, unloved, grouchy old spinster?� Sorry, I should have put that more tactfully."
Tears now flowed freely down Stephanie's face. Polly's words hit a raw spot. Often she wondered if she'd grow old and lonely with no one to share her life. She accepted the offered tissue but turned away when Polly tried to put an arm around her. "Sorry," Polly whispered again, "I said too much. My big mouth again. I'd better get back to Pete. Sorry if I've upset you more than you were. You've a lot to think about before tomorrow. I think you know me well enough to realise I won't be one of those taking the piss out of you." Stephanie continued to face away from the girl and didn't look round when she left.
"What am I going to do?" Stephanie asked herself for the hundredth time that night. "Can I really submit myself to that Benson man? Is Polly right about him? Will he love me? No, more likely he'll just treat me as a whore and fuck me like a prostitute, which, in a way, I suppose I will be. Polly might like that but I don't think I will. Will the girls make my life miserable or will David put a stop to it like Poll suggested? Will I just be given menial work to do? If Kelly's doing my work I'll probably have to work the machines but I don't know too much about them. What will he�?" Finally she fell into an uneasy sleep without having made a decision one way or the other.

Chapter 3. Punished
All work stopped, all talking ceased, all eyes turned as the door to the side entrance opened and Stephanie stepped into the office pulling her suitcase after her. For a few moments life seemed to stand still. No one moved. Even the customer Tracy was serving stopped her explanation. She had no idea what was happening but she knew something was about too. David, sitting alongside Stella discussing her artwork, turned slowly and said coldly, "You're late Steph. Put your case in the storeroom and go into my office. Stand in the corner facing the wall, I'll be in when I've finished here and will deal with you then." 
Tears streamed down her face as she dragged her case into the store. Polly helped push it under a shelf and whispered, "You're very brave Stephanie. We didn't think you'd come. Try and keep calm and you'll get through it." Stephanie walked into David's office and stood in the corner as she'd been ordered. She left the door open in case closing it would further rile her boss.
"I wouldn't let my manager treat me like that," Janet, the customer, stated, "I thought she was in charge of the office."
"She was until last Friday. Kelly's in charge now. And David's a good boss; there's a special reason for what you saw that I'm not going into. Now you wanted a print run of a thousand�" Tracy didn't wish to go into a detailed explanation and wanted to get rid of the customer as soon as she could to see what David would do.
David was both disappointed and glad when Stephanie didn't turn up at the usual time of 8:30. Kwikprint didn't open to the public until nine o'clock but he liked to get things organised, the machines warmed up and the girls settled into their work routine before any callers came. At nine he'd accepted she wasn't coming and he would have to see about getting a replacement. His mind wasn't really on the explanation Stella was giving him. Now he was even less sure as to what to do. Sending her into his office to wait like a naughty girl, at least gave him some time to think about his next move. "Sorry Stella, would you mind going through that again. My mind blanked out." She smiled, correctly guessing the reason. He still found it difficult to concentrate but for another ten minutes he pretended to do so. "Email the two alternatives to Faulkener's and see which they will go for, Stella. Let them choose and if they want some alterations, go from there. You know I'm not into some of your arty designs but Faulkener's seem to appreciate them." Slowly he made his way round to each of his employees and had a word with them. Every time he passed the open door to his office, he glanced in and saw Stephanie was still in the corner waiting. As soon as Janet left and only the staff were in the building, he entered his office and shut the door. 
Stephanie glanced nervously around and then faced the wall again. "Come and stand in front of my desk Steph," and when she complied he went on, "I take it that you've thought long and hard about this over the weekend?"
"Yes, Sir."
"I have too, although I didn't really expect you to come back. I decided that, given the chance, I would really keep you as a slave and you must have accepted that by returning but I, and I'm sure you as well, realise there are limits to what I can do. In the world of today, I cannot be an old-fashioned slave master who flogs his slaves without mercy. However, I will test the limits of what I can do without causing you any real harm. Is that understood?"
"I think so sir." 
"First of all your position here. You are my slave and not slave to the others. With them you are an equal except that Kelly is now your supervisor. They cannot order you to do anything that isn't in the normal course of your work. You will continue to do the same work as before except Kelly will now issue the work sheets and that kind of stuff. You will do the filing and ordering as before and be the link between the main office and me. You will still work at the same desk and perhaps now you will remember to turn the intercom off." David grinned at her but she didn't return the smile. "I shall continue to pay you at the same rate as previously. So far, I wouldn't think that will be too much of a problem for you, will it?"
"No sir."
"After work, you will come to my home and cook and clean and I shall also expect you to sleep in my bed with all that entails. At home, you will be completely my slave and will do my bidding and allow me full access to your body whenever I wish. I would guess you haven't taken many men to bed before, is that so?"
Stephanie blushed, "I have never�"
"So this will be a new experience for you. One I hope you enjoy but if you don't, too bad. As long as I do. You are only my slave whose purpose in life is to give me pleasure. Failure to do so will result in punishment. Make no mistake about that. That is what being a slave means and by coming here with your case ready packed, it is what you've agreed to. Any questions?" David knew he was laying it on a bit thick but he could always back down a bit.
"Sir, how long will my slavery last?"
"Until I grant you your freedom. That might be a month; it could be ten years. You will earn your freedom by being a good and faithful slave."
"Will you use contraception sir? I wouldn't think you would wish me to become pregnant and I'm not on the pill or anything."
"Yes, but we will arrange for you to go to the clinic as soon as we can. I think that is all we need to say for the time being. We can work out the details as we go along. As of now you are my 24/7 slave and will do my wishes without question. The only alternative is to do a runner. Then it will be no pay and no references. Understood?"
"Yes sir. Please don't be too hard on me. I didn't really mean what I said. I was just angry."
"I know that but I am still going to give you the punishment I promised and as the others heard your outburst, so they will hear you squeal when I smack your bare arse. Remove your skirt and knickers slave."
"But sir�"
"The door is closed slave Steph. None of them will see you and I shall be seeing you completely naked before the day is out. Get used to it. Either do as I say now, or run out of the building or I get the girls in to help undress and hold you down. You accepted the position of slave so I hope you are not going to renege on it. Now prepare for your punishment."
All the previous evening and for much of the night, Stephanie had tried to imagine how she would cope when ordered to undress for the first time. "Just do it and be proud of what you have even if it isn't much compared with any of the others at the works. Don't let him see you are afraid or humiliated by it," she repeated to herself but now it came to actually doing it her proud thoughts went flying out of the window. Crying, Stephanie slowly undid the zip on her skirt and lowered it. Even more hesitatingly she lowered her knickers and stepped out of both garments. "Just do it and be proud of what you have," she silently started to say her mantra. David walked around the sobbing woman and noted her luxuriant growth of pubic hair. He ran his fingers through it, causing Stephanie further embarrassment, but it was a little while before he removed them.
"Lay over my desk Steph. It's only going to be a hand spanking this time unless I have to get someone to hold you." Knowing she had little choice, Stephanie did as requested. "Kelly, are there any customers in the shop please," David asked into the intercom. 
"One just leaving, David."
"Then keep the line open until one comes in or until I say close it. I'm weighting the switch this side so it doesn't spring shut. Everyone can listen in."
"SMACK!!" "Aaahh!" Stephanie tried to mute her cry but the intercom picked it up and relayed it to the office. Tracy quickly latched the outside door so no one would get in.
"SMACK!!" "Aaahh!" "SMACK!!" "Aaahh!" "SMACK!!" "Aaahh!" David smacked the offered bottom as hard as he could until both cheeks had received about twenty swats and Stephanie was sobbing and writhing almost uncontrollably. Resolutely she tried not to give him the satisfaction of pleading but in the end she succumbed and after only a few more hard smacks he finished. He switched the intercom off after telling the girls to return to their work, knowing they would be discussing what he'd done for the rest of the week. Turning to Stephanie he spoke quietly as he helped her to her feet and hugged her for a few minutes. She started to resist but quickly gave up. "Use my toilet and clean your face up. There's some cream in the cabinet that should help your bottom. I use it after I've had a hard ride. Put your skirt back on but leave your knickers here. That's the only punishment you need have if you do what you should." 
She felt his erection hard against her loins but tried to ignore it in case he wanted to take her there and then and perhaps open the intercom again for the others to hear. All her instincts told her to condemn what he had done to her volubly and vociferously but she kept remembering that was why she was in this position and it was why her bottom was now so sore. Deciding on a policy of saying nothing she didn't have to, she murmured, "Thank you sir."
Twenty minutes later David half dragged her into the main office. "Girls," he started so all could hear, "Let me remind you again that Stephanie is my slave not yours. You will treat her as you do each other. You will not make fun of her or try to wind her up. If she gives you problems, you bring them to me and I will deal with her in my way. Now please continue with your work. I think all of you have more than enough to get on with." 
They did indeed have plenty to do and with David popping into the main office more frequently than usual, the girls had little chance of antagonising Stephanie. Polly did speak to her while she waited for a packaging note and waybill. "Keep your cool Stephanie. He could have hit you far worse. Probably by now your bottom is just beginning to feel nice and warm and you'll start feeling horny. Pete's spanked me a couple of times before we fucked but not as hard as yours sounded."
At 12:30 the sandwich van came and most days, the staff bought lunch from it and they closed the shop for half an hour. Today when Stephanie rose to go to the van David bade he sit where she was. He bought her a salad roll, something she frequently bought for herself and gave it to her.
"Can I be a slave too David?" Stella quipped. "That seems to be the only way I'll get the boss to buy me lunch!"
"Owning a slave has responsibilities as well as pleasures, Stella. If I keep a slave I have to feed her. That's my responsibility."
"The same as it was your responsibility to smack her arse for being naughty," Stella laughed. There was no malice in the words but they caused tears to once again well in Stephanie's eyes. Seeing this, Stella came over and gave her a hug and said, "Sorry. I didn't mean to offend you." Stephanie just nodded but for the first time she felt the apology she received was genuine and she was now part of the staff. Part of their group and not the dreaded supervisor. 
"Another perk of being my slave," David whispered to her, "Is that you get to use my toilet and you can use the cream again if you need to." Stephanie knew that using his loo was a big concession. If she used the normal staff one, the girls might have accosted her and deliberately antagonised her there in the hope she'd throw another tantrum. However, even after being with them for only a few hours, she felt they were more sympathetic to her than they'd been all the previous months.
As was common with their business, the mornings were relatively quiet with non-urgent work that had come in the previous day, being completed. In the afternoons, the pace usually picked up with jobs coming in that needed to be out the same afternoon. So it was on the first afternoon of Stephanie's slavery. No one had much time to do anything but work. David even had to make the coffee at afternoon break because the others, even Polly who usually did the job, were so busy. He was pleased that the staff were working happily again. Even Stephanie was caught up in the urgency of the productions and began to forget her sore bottom until she sat down a little too hard.

Chapter 4. Stephanie submits
Shaking a little, Stephanie waited on the doorstep of David's home, a detached four bedroomed house in quite a good neighbourhood. Barbara gave her a lift so she didn't have to get a taxi or trundle her case along the road. "Good luck Steph," she called back when they parted, "Go with the flow. He's not a bad man really. You've seen him at his worst for the last few days." Compared to her own one bedroomed flat, this was a palace but in fact in was just a good middleclass dwelling. David arrived on his bike twenty minutes later. During the interval she took a quick look round the front garden and peeped through the window but didn't dare to go round the back. What she saw impressed her. At her flat she only had a window box. Now she stood and admired the small front garden filled with shrubs that partially hid the house from the road and a decorative brick path leading from the small wrought iron gate to the recessed porch and the front door. Her look through the window showed the lounge and as far as she could tell, this appeared neat and tidy. The driveway next to the house led to a detached carport and garage, She guessed that was where he kept the Audi car that he used for work when he had calls or deliveries to make.
"Sorry, I got waylaid just as I was about to lock up. Another order for tomorrow and then I called at the chemist&#8217;s to get some condoms." This reminder of what would happen later had Stephanie shaking again. "It'll be alright Steph. I'm not going to be a harsh slave driver. We'll do it by easy stages even if you are a slave and must bow to my wishes. I want it to be fun too." He gave her a hug. "Best we get inside. I bet old Mrs. Arkroyd over the road is having a field day speculating as to what you're doing here on my doorstep with a case. I haven't brought many ladies home since Lisa left. Come on in. I'll give you the grand tour of your new home." He picked up Stephanie's case. "You got the kitchen sink in here?" he laughed as he lifted it inside.
"And this is our bedroom." Stephanie noted that the bed was made and most things were put away. "Did he really expect me?" she queried to herself. "He didn't seem to. All the other rooms have been reasonably tidy too. Perhaps he has a housekeeper?" She kept quiet and didn't voice her thoughts on the assumption that a slave should not question her master and she would no doubt find out in due course. Her eyes took in the king size bed and some nice looking modern furniture including a dressing table with a large illuminated mirror. It all seemed very grandiose compared with her pokey little bedroom with its cheap, mismatched furniture.
"You'll sleep that side." David's statement brought her out of her reverie, "I've got used to being on this side of the bed and you can sleep where Lisa did. I'll have to clear some space for your stuff because I seem to have taken over all the drawers and shelves she had. I can probably get that tallboy cleared fairly easily and make some space in the wardrobe. We can have a better reorganisation at the weekend." Stephanie, being almost alongside the tallboy, pulled open the middle drawer to reveal David's masturbater. The expression on her face showed her shock at seeing the device. "Yeah Steph, I use one but I shouldn't need it now I have you. I daresay you have the female version hidden in your underwear drawer or under your pillow." He noticed that she blushed but didn't reply.
"The plan for the evening is this," David informed her when they'd completed the house tour, "First we'll shower and wash some of the work grime off. Have you a track suit or a dressing gown or something lose fitting and comfortable to wear afterwards?" Stephanie said that she'd brought a dressing gown but didn't own a tracksuit. "Then we'll eat, unpack your things and relax. I want to find out a little more about my new slave's life. You've never said much about yourself while you've worked for us. And afterwards, in the words of Pepys, 'and so to bed'."
"Just do it and be proud of what you have," Stephanie repeated her mantra over and over when David took her hand and led her into the bathroom. Still she trembled at the thought of being completely naked in front of him and likewise he would be naked too. "Probably his penis will be erect. I noticed it was hard after he spanked me but then it was hidden in his trousers. Will I have to touch it? Will he do me now? In the shower? I've heard some people do it there. Oh God, what have I let myself in for?" 
David quickly dispelled that idea. "I'm going to undress you now Steph and then you'll do the same for me. I want to see what your body is really like under those clothes. I shall examine you closely and feel your tits and cunt." He deliberately used the crudest terms. "You will do the same for me. I'm sure you secretly want to see and feel my prick."
"No sir. I don't. I'm just doing this because I have to. I didn't have any real choice. I've agreed to be your slave. I am your slave. I shall do what I'm told because I have no wish to have my bottom smacked again." Stephanie tried to make it sound as though she was only reluctantly doing what she was told. "Just do it and be proud of what you have. Just do it and be proud of what you have. Just do it and be proud of what you have." The words she'd rehearsed repeated themselves in her mind.
"As you wish slave," David laughed and began unbuttoning her blouse. Stephanie couldn't help blushing when he removed it and then her plain white bra. "Good body for a thirty-two year old. Nice firm tits. Small, much smaller than Lisa's but still nice. They don't need a bra to support them slave. You'll leave it off tomorrow." David rubbed his hands over the mounds and noticed how erect and firm the nipples were. She tried to pull away when David put his mouth over one but she quickly remembered her station in life there and stayed in position. It felt nice anyway although she wasn't going to admit it. Shortly after, when he'd removed all her garments, David put his mouth over her cunt and tongued her slit. "It's wetter than this morning," he said to himself, "Maybe she isn't as frigid as she makes out." 
"Ouch!" Stephanie squealed when he squeezed her arse. 
"I guess you're still a bit tender there Steph. Your bum's only a bit pink now though but I can easily redden it again if you don't behave. Shall I do that?" He suspected some of the pinkness was the result of chafe from sitting on her skirt without wearing knickers but some signs still remained of his chastisement. 
"No sir. I'll try and be a good slave."
David stood back and took a good look at her boyish figure. She was certainly slim, actually David decided she was thin and would need feeding up. He liked her long dark hair when it was left loose like it was now, but was uncertain about the hair covering her crotch. He already knew her arse was small and wondered if more food would help her there too. "Probably she doesn't bother cooking for herself too much. I know I had to force myself when Lisa left and I like good food and I have to keep my fitness for cycle racing."
"Undress me then slave," he ordered when he completed his inspection.
As she anticipated, David penis jutted forward, fully erect when she finally removed his pants. It seemed large but she'd nothing to compare it too except the immature one on boy who took her virginity all those years ago. It fascinated her. It frightened her. There was no way she seemed able to prevent her body trembling. "Is he going to do it to me now?" she kept wondering. "Just do it and be proud of what you have. Just do it and be proud of what you have." Again and again she repeated her mantra but without realising her mental question, David answered it.
"We'll wash each other and get used to the feel of our bodies. I want to leave our first fuck until we're in bed and can do it in comfort. Lisa and I did it in the shower a few times but it always seemed a bit awkward." By the end of the shower, Stephanie was becoming more used to feeling his body and he hers. David spent some time massaging her pubic mound and was pleased when she began to covertly respond.
"Time to show me your cooking skills now slave. There's a couple of steaks in the freezer you can defrost in the microwave and some oven chips. Fry some onions and cook a bit of broccoli."
"Sir, I need to�." Stephanie indicated the toilet.
"Well get on and use it then. A slave doesn't need privacy for that. We'll both have to use the bathroom at the same time in the morning so we can get to work on time." Stephanie stood still in disbelief. Seeing her hesitation, David lifted the back of her dressing gown, gave her arse a couple of hefty smacks and plonked her unceremoniously on the toilet seat. "Piss or do whatever you have to." It took a few moments before she could but in the end her bladder gave way and the rush of her pee into the bowl seemed unduly loud because she knew he was listening. When she tried to surreptitiously wipe herself, David opened her gown and deliberately watched closely knowing it was embarrassing her. 
"The noise you made has made me want to go to so you can stand and watch me." He lowered the front of his tracksuit and pissed so she saw his stream splash noisily into the water. "Get used to it Steph," he said, "We'll be much more intimate later and it didn't hurt you, or at least it wouldn't have done if I didn't have to smack you first."
The rest of the evening passed quietly enough. He was pleased with the meal and said so and then helped her to unpack. When she finally shut the drawers for the last time it seemed to her to put the seal on her slavery. Her clothes were now in his house, in his tallboy and his wardrobe, in his bedroom. She felt that he now owned her. It was not like she was away on holiday. For a short while she wondered how long it would be before she returned to her own little flat. "Will I ever go back there? What about all the stuff I've left behind? Will it be safe with no one living there?" Fortunately she didn't have much time to ponder these questions before David took her into the lounge and sat her alongside him on the settee.
For the next hour, aided by a glass of wine, he wormed Stephanie's life history from her. At 18 after a row with her mother she left home, obtained an office job and went to evening classes to get further qualifications. "I never had any boyfriends after the painful experience with Reggie Harris and my lack of what you might term 'womanly assets' didn't get me invited out. At work the only way I seemed to be able to get people to do what I wanted was to order them to do so and that didn't make me very popular either."
Towards the end of his questioning, David sat Stephanie on his lap, opened her dressing gown and suckled her breasts. Stephanie tried to distance herself from what he was doing but when his hand probed between her legs she couldn't help but become aroused. David was right in suspecting she owned a vibrator but in fact she rarely used it. For years she'd tried to shut sex out of her life and now it was being thrust forcibly into it. A shiver ran through her body as she realised that it would not be long now before David tried to fuck her. "Will he hurt me like Reggie Harris? He's certainly taking the trouble to get me aroused. He could just as easily have pushed me back on this couch and raped me. I can feel his hard prick against my thighs. I wonder if he actually likes me or is he just making sure I stay with him and don't go complaining to the authorities? Does it matter?"
"And so to bed," David whispered in her ear. Nervously she allowed him to lead her up the stairs and into the bedroom. There he removed her dressing gown and his tracksuit. Naked they climbed into bed. "Put the condom on me Steph, then we'll be ready." Clumsily she tore open the packet and under his guidance, rolled the latex tube down his prick.
"You know you have to go through with it Steph," she told herself, "You can't chicken out now. Maybe it won't be as bad as before. Let him do it his way. He's had more experience than you have." Still she worried as he turned her on her back and opened her legs. "Please don't hurt me sir," she pleaded. 
David could feel her shaking and knew her fear of what was going to happen was very real. "Just lie down and calm yourself Steph. I have no intention of hurting you at the moment. Relax and keep your legs open wide." Stephanie was surprised when he didn't plunge straight into her but instead put his mouth on her cunt and started laving the area and sucking her clit. Already somewhat aroused from their session on the settee, her juices now flowed freely and it wasn't long before David positioned his prick at her entrance and worked his way in.
"It doesn't really hurt, just feels a bit full. Quite nice really. Oooh now he's working it. He's fucking me and it feels nice. Oooohh! Keep it up sir. I shouldn't really like it. He's raping me. I'm only letting him because my job was at stake. But it feels nice. Perhaps I should push back to him. Ooohh! That's good. Push harder David. No, I mustn't let him see that I'm enjoying it. Is this what Polly meant? Ooohh my God, I'm coming." Stephanie's emotions ran wild but she tried to keep them bottled within her. However, she couldn't contain the scream of pleasure as she orgasmed for the first time with a man. David, who had been doing his utmost to make sure she came before he did, finally allowed his pleasure and released his seed into the rubber teat.
Collapsing on to his partner, sweating profusely, he lay there and repeatedly kissed her. "Thanks Steph," he murmured, "I enjoyed that. It's been a long while since I last had a woman in bed with me. I hope you enjoyed it too and even it you won't admit to it, I'm sure there wasn't the pain you dreaded."
Stephanie didn't answer. Already she knew her life would be very different from now on. Tentatively she returned David's kisses.

Chapter 5. In trouble again
"Did you get your bum smacked again last night? Did he screw you over the kitchen table as soon as you got through the door? Or did he tie you down to the bed and rape you good and hard while you screamed for mercy? Did you have to suck him? Or take it in your bum hole?" Tracy kept up a tirade of nagging questions when Stephanie sat at her desk the next morning. Stephanie tried to ignore them but Tracy just stood there with a smirk on her face as if to say, "You're getting your comeuppance now bitch.
"That's none of your business you nosy cow!" Stephanie's cool finally snapped and she spoke more forcibly than she intended and caused the others to stop and look her way. Her reply only brought a whoop of derision from Tracy. Stephanie knew she'd made a mistake in answering that way and David wouldn't be in for another twenty minutes or so to stop the snide questioning. He was driving today because he had to call at a client's premises on his way and it was too dangerous to cycle along the busy main road in the rush hour to get there. Tears ran down her face as Tracy began asking more and more intimate questions as to what David had made her do, but she resolutely refused to give any further answer. The questioning would have continued had not Kelly put an end to it and told Tracy to get on with her work. That Kelly had taken that action and not joined in the questioning, surprised and pleased her.
Barbara picked her up on her way into work but had only made polite conversation about the weather and the work that was to be done but now she was here, Tracy was determined to give her a hard time. The pair had never got on very well at the best of times but until now, Stephanie was always in the position of authority. Tracy was determined to get her own back. 
A few minutes after the altercation died down, Polly came to her desk and gripped her shoulder reassuringly for a moment or two and then left to get on with her own work. Knowing that she had at least one ally on the staff, lifted Stephanie's spirits a little. Polly now seemed to be her friend even though she was almost young enough to be her daughter and Kelly seemed to be acting as a proper supervisor. Stella, as always, was in a little world of her own, totally immersed in the artwork on the screen. Fighting back her tears, Stephanie tried to sort the paperwork for the day's work, and blot out her thoughts on the previous night. However, the memories kept returning of David and what he did to her.
Mid afternoon Kelly came to her desk holding a set of car keys, "I've cleared it with David, Steph you are to take his car and deliver Beecham's order. You'll have to put the back seats down to get it all in. Take Polly to help you load and unload it and if they have their next order ready for us, bring that back with you."
"They're still deciding on the actual wording and layout," Jack the foreman at Beecham's informed them, "They say about half an hour. Can you wait that long? The canteen's still open if you want a cuppa." Stephanie phoned and Kelly said to wait. "It's not worth coming back and having to go out there again. We're fairly quiet here for an afternoon."
"Would you like to talk about it Steph? It's okay if you say no, but if you want to get it off your chest, I can listen and it won't go any further. There's no one around that can hear." Polly and Stephanie sat in a corner of the canteen each with a mug of tea in front of them. Stephanie was silent for a while, partly thinking about what happened and partly trying to decide whether to tell Polly.
"We did it Poll. We made love and I liked it although I didn't tell him so but I think he knew. Like you said, it didn't hurt and it made me feel close to him even if I didn't want to. He seemed to try and make it good for me, wasn't rough or anything."
"Good for you Steph. If you can enjoy it with David, you can enjoy it with a man you really want to be with." Stephanie related the events of the evening and her first sex for many years. 
"I found it very difficult to sleep at all. It was so strange to have someone in bed with me. I have never ever slept with a man, or a woman for that matter. Not even as a child. I think it's been a while for David too because he seemed very restless. I'd just drifted off to sleep when he woke me. It was only six o'clock but he wanted to do it again so by the time I got to work I was still tired and a bit sore and when Tracy started on me, I lost it for a minute. Do you think she'll complain to David while we're away?"
"I wouldn't have thought so," Polly replied trying to reassure the older woman, but knowing Tracy she secretly she believed she would.
By the time they returned to Kwikprint it was 4:30 but the place was a hive of activity to get an order finished before five. Tracy smirked as they came in through the main entrance and Polly guessed she'd been right in assuming she'd complained to David about Stephanie's indiscretion. This was confirmed when David ordered Stephanie into his office.
"I'm disappointed in you slave," David started, "You couldn't control your temper for two minutes when I wasn't around. Well you know what I have to do. Over the desk with you."
"Sir, please it wasn't�"
"Don't start whining or making excuses. Over the desk."
"No�please�" David wasn't going to listen, not after her outburst of last Friday. Gripping her arms he forcibly pushed he across his desk, raised her skirt and started to spank.
"Whaap! Whaap! Whaap! Whaap!" David laid two stinging blows on each of her bottom cheeks."
"Don't do it David. It wasn't really her fault." Polly entered the office unannounced. "If anything you should be spanking Tracy. She was goading her so bad as soon as she came in."
"Get out Poll. This is nothing to do with you." David ordered.
"No sir, I'm not leaving yet. Steph's done a lot of things I haven't liked but almost anyone would have snapped at the way Tracy was provoking her into telling what you two did together last night. I know master's don't HAVE to be fair to their slaves but it will probably help your personal relationship if you are."
"Okay Poll, you've made your point for the moment. I don't want to be unfair. What really happened." He allowed Stephanie to stand while Polly recited her version of the morning's altercation. " Thanks Poll. Well she did lose her cool with Tracy even if she was under pressure so I think that in this case, four smacks is enough. Clean yourself up a bit Steph and either stay here or go back to your desk. Next time I promise I'll ask for your version of the event first."
Stephanie decided it would be best to go to her desk and make it seem that little happened. Because of Polly's intervention, she would be able to sit well enough. 
"Tracy will you come into my office please?" David called out loud enough for everyone to hear. "She emerged ten minutes later looking very subdued but she wouldn't say what happened. She glared at both Stephanie and Polly but went back to her desk for the few remaining minutes of the day. Stella had to stay and complete some work ready for printing first thing in the morning so David stayed too. He and Stephanie sat either of the artist as she deftly moved clips around on the screen and asked for their opinion. Not that she really took much notice. Her ideas were generally far better than theirs, but it kept them occupied.
Finally, when they could sit back while the laser printer did a proof, David asked, "What's your version of this morning's fracas Stella?"
"Oh I guess Tracy wanted to know all the juicy bits of what happened between you two last night, well I guess we all did, but Tracy was rather forcible in her probing and suggested some of the more obscene things you might have done to her. Steph told her to mind her own business and not to be a nosy cow. She was a bit sharp with her tongue but I could understand why and then Kelly went and sent Tracy back to work. I think I would have said something similar to her if it had been me. Or probably I'd have said worse. It was obvious she was trying to humiliate Steph."

"Sir?" Stephanie started when they were relaxing in front of the TV later that evening. David had her on his lap and was playing with her tits. "Sir? Will you make me do the things Tracy suggested?"
"Like what Steph?"
"Like sucking you and having you in my bottom."
"Yes, I expect so, but we'll work up to them gradually. Lisa didn't mind sucking my prick but wasn't into sodomy. I would like to try that when we get to know each other better." He paused and then went on with a little grin, "But with a slave it doesn't matter if she's keen or not." His arm tightened around Stephanie's body and he rolled one of her nipples between his thumb and forefinger. "I think this might be a good time to watch a video. It was supposed to be an instructional video for newly weds but really it's more porn in content. It'll give you some idea of what we might do."
The video started with the wedding ceremony and cut to the bedroom with the groom undressing his bride. While the narrator stressed the importance of couples getting to know each other's bodies the man openly groped the woman's tits. In turn she massaged his balls and prick. "Often on the first night together, both the bride and groom are so nervous of doing it for the first time, they do not become fully aroused. In this case the groom should stimulate his bride orally�" The scene cut to a close-up of the man tonguing the woman's cunt while the narrator gave a blow-by-blow account of what he was doing and the bride moaned loudly in false ecstasy. "Often too the man fails to get a full erection through nervousness at the thought of having to perform well for the bride's inauguration to sex. If this is the case it is the bride that needs to perform orally�" 
"Watch carefully, Steph. You will do this to me afterwards although it won't be through the necessity of getting me erect," David laughed and Stephanie knew what he meant. His prick was fully hard and resting against her thigh.
As she watched the woman give an expert blowjob; definitely she wasn't the virgin bride the video claimed, Stephanie debated within herself whether or not she would do it to David. David, her boss, her master. "Damn the man! Why am I so aroused? Why does he keep rubbing my clit? Or is it the film making me so wet? It seems so disgusting to put that thing in a person's mouth and yet that woman seems to be enjoying it. She's only a whore actress though. What if I refuse? Another spanking I suppose. What if I bite it? A worse spanking? Maybe the cane? Or I get thrown out and have to look for another job. What if he spurts his stuff in my mouth?" The last question was answered on the video.
"�Oral stimulation of the penis may cause ejaculation, often premature ejaculation." The woman opened her mouth for the camera and showed what appeared to be a large quantity of sperm coating her tongue. "�There is no need to be concerned about this. The fluid emitted is almost tasteless and will cause no harm. Some women try and spit it out but it is cleaner and a far more satisfactory experience for both parties if she swallows the emission and continues to gently suck on the penis until it is fully clean. With a young couple the man will regain his erection in a short while and�"
David stopped the tape. "Kneel between my legs Steph." Stephanie looked at his prick and hesitated. It looked clean enough but she knew he'd pissed out of it after the washing-up had been done. It was one thing to see it on film, quite another to do it for real. And it looked as if he wanted her to go all the way, like that whore� "Do it slave," David commanded more forcibly, "It's not going to hurt you any but my hand or my slipper will." 
She knelt and took his prick in her hand. Her nose registered a faint musky aroma, a slight smell she hadn't noticed when she'd washed it in the shower, but it didn't seem too unpleasant. "But why does he want to put it in my mouth when he's spent so much time stimulating me that I'm soaking wet and my nipples are hard? I'll have to do it though. Got to appear to accept my slavery I suppose." Closing her eyes in an effort to pretend it wasn't his prick that was going to suck, she opened her mouth and took the end in. After a few moments David's hand on the back of her head gently pushed her further on to his prick and then made her suck him in the manner she'd seen on the film. She opened her eyes and looked up at him as if to ask, "Is this what you wanted?" It wasn't too unpleasant either. In fact she decided it wasn't unpleasant at all but again preferred not to reveal the fact to her master. "The worst part is the way his hair tickles my nose, but what about when he comes. His won't be a premature ejaculation like those fake teenage lovers. I'll be doing this for a while. Should I make more effort and get it over quickly or just let him work himself and take longer? Get it over with girl. It's not that bad and I like the way I'm actually controlling him without him knowing it." Stephanie started to imitate the girl on the video and despite not wanting to, David quickly shot his sperm load into her mouth. At first Stephanie hardly realised that he'd done so. There wasn't much taste and certainly none of the 'hot boiling liquid' she remembered reading in a novel. 
David's hand kept her head in position for a short while before releasing her and sitting her on his lap again. "That was really great," he praised, "Thanks. I hope I can satisfy you in a little while." He kissed her gently and could taste a little of his own spending on her lips. 
For a time they cuddled without watching the remainder of the video. Stephanie's mind again a whirlpool of mixed emotions. She conceded that she was enjoying his attentions and much of what he did with her but always there was the underlying feeling that she shouldn't let him take control of her in this way. While lying in David's arms she analysed her options, "On the whole, so far at least, my life as a slave hasn't been too bad. He keeps me, we have good food that I don't pay for and he seems to like me. I've been spanked though and have to give in to his sexual desires. Why can't I say 'he fucks me'? I'm growing to like that although I don't tell him so. I think he knows it. I suppose I can take it for a week or two until I get enough money in the bank to put a deposit down on a car and I can get another job. I still have to pay rent on the other place but the fuel and phone charges will be down. Still have to deal with the girls at work. That Tracy treats me like shit. I suppose the others aren't too bad. Kelly surprised me. She didn't give me the grief I expected."
"Up you get slave girl. Make us a hot drink and then it will be bedtime." David interrupted her reverie.
"Yes master," Stephanie replied in good humour and laughed as David aimed a mock slap at her backside.

Chapter 6. The accident
Stephanie lay alone dozing and luxuriating in the feeling that she wouldn't have to get up for another hour or so. It was Sunday and the clock indicated 8:05. David was out on his cycle doing a 25 mile time trial and wouldn't be back until 10:30 at the earliest. She'd been with him a month but already her slavery had become more of a joke than an actuality. Most of the time he treated her as his 'significant other'. At work she still called him 'Sir' whereas the others used his first name and in the house, he only called her slave when he wanted sex or wanted to insist on her obedience. For the first fortnight she pretended she was only responding to his orders but gradually she had to admit, even to herself, that she enjoyed what they did together. "I'm really his unmarried wife, his partner in today's parlance," She mused. "I suppose yesterday was typical of the routine we've gotten into. Get up, get breakfast and then drive to Tesco's. I push the trolley around and get most of the groceries we need for the week, he pays by credit card and when we're home, I put the stuff away while he goes and tinkers with his bike. We did actually go for a walk along the riverbank in the afternoon but most Saturday's I have cooking or housework to do. He does help though and does much of the garden. Evenings are the same on most weekdays. We read, watch TV or he plays with me. I suppose we're in a bit of a rut but it suits me at the moment. I'm able to put money away so I could leave if I wanted to in a few months time. Actually, I quite like it here although I've never admitted it to him. Work is going a lot better than I expected. Kelly's okay and doesn't try to put me down or treat me as a slave. Tracy still tries to tempt me into an outburst whenever she thinks she can get away with it�"
"Dring, dring, dring."
"Dammit, who's phoning at this time of the morning. Good job there's a phone by the bed here even if it is on David's side." She picked up the receiver and gave her number.
"This in nurse Bates at the Alison Carter Hospital is that miss Stephanie Jones?" When she'd received conformation the nurse went on, "A Mr. David Benson has been brought in after an accident a short while ago. He asked us to contact you. They've just taken him into theatre but his injuries didn't appear life threatening. Probably though one leg is broken but we can't tell until the surgeon's studied the x-rays. Sorry I don't have anymore more information at the moment."
Stephanie hurriedly dressed and drove David's car to the hospital five miles away. She needn't have rushed. It took an hour before they brought him out of theatre and another hour before he was conscious and even then he was pretty much out of it and could only say a few disjointed words before he fell asleep again. "What are his injuries?" she asked the nurse who referred her to Dr. Knights. 
"Right leg broken in two places and torn knee ligaments. The leg was badly splintered so we had to put some hardware in. He should walk again without too many problems but it will take time for everything to heal so he can walk without aids. There are some areas of body bruising and minor cuts. No head injury that we can see, thanks to his helmet." Stephanie tried to question him further but he was dragged away to another case.
Another cyclist, who Stephanie recognised by sight, turned up, still clad in colourful Lycra. "I'm Cyril, we were in the same trial but I went off ahead of him and didn't know until I finished. You must be Steph. How is he? Have they told you?"
She told him the few details she knew and asked if he knew what happened. According to Sam who was right behind him, they were going along on the straight with the wind behind them. I guess they were doing 25-30 miles an hour on that bit and some fool driver tried to turn left just in front of his wheels. Dave hit the side of the car and bounced off the bonnet into the road and the car ran over his leg. There was a marshall on the corner so he saw it too. He got the ambulance and police. The police breath tested the driver and took him away so I guess he was over the limit." Cyril stayed a little longer and then said, "I can't do much here at the moment so if you don't mind I'll go home and get a shower and come back later. I only live down the road and I promised to let the others know how he is."
For a while David drifted in and out of sleep but by early afternoon he was fully awake and in considerable pain despite having been given painkillers. He could see she'd been crying and squeezed her hand. "It'll be okay slave." His grin was almost a grimace from the pain but Stephanie sensed he was trying to joke. Kelly arrived soon after Stephanie phoned her. Cyril returned and they were all at his bedside when the surgeon made his rounds. "We'll probably keep him in for ten to fourteen days mainly because of the reconstruction work we had to do on the broken bone and his knee will need to be kept immobile for at least a week. After that he'll be need a wheelchair and crutches for another six to eight weeks." 
"Six to eight weeks sounds very optimistic," Cyril remarked glumly when the surgeon left, "A neighbour of mine fell off a ladder and broke bones in his leg and it was six months before he could limp along without sticks." That remark didn't cheer any of them up. Seeing this and realising what he'd said, Cyril grinned, "Course, Dave's fitter and thinner than my neighbour and he's got a woman to look after him so he might get better quicker." 
David tried to laugh too. "Depends I suppose on what she does to me." Stephanie blushed. Cyril took his leave when they started to talk about work. "You two ladies will have to look after the firm for me for a week or two. Can you manage that?" David asked. They both nodded. "I knew you could. If I make you both acting chief executive officers, will you be able to work together as equals?" He looked directly at Stephanie. 
"Yes," she answered, trying to sound positive but inside she wondered how she would react when in a position of power again. She knew though, her month of slavery had changed her attitude considerably. After a little more discussion, David seemed very tired and started to drift off again. Stephanie kissed him and they left.
"You haven't eaten have you?" Kelly looked concerned. When Stephanie shook her head Kelly went on, "Come to my place and we can make dinner together and perhaps work out what we are going to do tomorrow."

All eyes turned to Kelly and Stephanie as they emerged from David's office. They agreed to arrive half an hour earlier than the others to sort things out. The other four were in a group talking about David's accident and discussing the options. Stephanie updated them on David's condition and gave them the details of how the accident occurred and how long he would possibly be unable to work. Then she went on, "In order to keep this place running, David has appointed Kelly and myself as Chief Executive Officers with equal status. Kelly will continue to run the works side of things and do some of the work that I did. I will be in David's office and doing his job and part of what I did out here. It will also mean that we shall have to ask all of you to add to your workload because it is impossible for the two of us to do the work of three people. We will ask each of you personally for your co-operation in this matter�" Stephanie went on for a few more minutes and then Kelly added a few words.
"You don't have to worry about asking me privately," Barbara spoke up, "I'll do all I can to help." Stella and Polly echoed her words.
Tracy though asked. "Does this mean you are now longer a slave?"
"I am still David's slave. The only difference as far as you are concerned Tracy, is that I am now your boss and not some underling in the corner desk." Tracy's face darkened but she said nothing. After more discussion as to the role each would play in the new schedule, it was time to open the doors to the public. Stephanie quickly found that there was more to David's job than sitting in a posh chair and answering the phone. There was so much to do that she'd hardly had time to stop for lunch and possibly wouldn't have stopped if Polly hadn't dragged her out.
When she visited David that evening, he seemed in better spirits although he was already becoming frustrated at lying in bed with a leg in plaster. Cyril, who worked late shifts, had been in during the afternoon visiting period, as had one of the veterans in the cycling club. Both had offered their help but at the moment none was needed. The police had been in as well to take a statement. Stephanie discussed the day's work and asked if he minded her using his car. 
The rest of the week passed in a similar way. Friday they all had to work late to get an order finished. Only Tracy left at the normal time, saying she had an appointment. Even Stella left her computer to help Polly finish packing the booklets. Stephanie thanked them all and Kelly thanked her. They all could see she was very tired herself and guessed she wasn't sleeping too well with the worry over David and having to travel to the hospital each evening.
David was very cheerful on Saturday afternoon. Cyril and another cyclist turned up as well and they were all in a joking mood. "The doctor says that they might allow me to go home on Wednesday if I continue to progress. They let me walk a few steps on crutches this morning. I won't be able to climb the stairs though so I'll have to sleep on the couch. That is if my slave will look after me." David let the word 'slave' out without thinking of the others there. His friends laughed and joked about what their girlfriends or wives would do if they called them a slave but, still tired from lack of sleep and the pressure of the week's work, Stephanie blushed and almost cried. David noticed but refrained from commenting and the moment passed when Ray, the other cyclist, said, "We've got a single bed in the spare room. You can borrow that if you'd like. We can get it in Tony's van and bring it over. Perhaps we'll do it after the training run in the morning if that's okay with you Steph?" Stephanie was amazed at the camaraderie amongst the cyclists, whom she'd always thought of as a peculiar bunch.
True to their word, a group of four cyclists, still in their colourful, bum-hugging cycling gear, arrived and manhandled the bed parts into the lounge, rearranged the furniture, set up the bed and even made it for her. "Keep it as long as you want," Ray told her, "We're not expecting any guests." Stephanie made tea and supplied biscuits and from the conversation in the kitchen she learned that David was a popular member of the club and could have done well racing in his class. As she saw them off, she looked across the road and wondered what Mrs. Ackroyd would be thinking about her being alone in the house with four hunky looking men, albeit two were pensioners.
Stephanie collected him from the hospital on Wednesday afternoon and found that by pushing the passenger seat back as far as it would go, David could sit in reasonable comfort. Even so he still looked pale and exhausted by the time he'd got out of the car and climbed the two shallow steps to the front door. "Now get into the bed and rest. You will stay there until I get home again," She assisted him on to the bed and made sure he was comfortable.
 "Since when does a slave order her master about?" David joked.
"Since this slave became a nurse," she responded, "And a grumpy old battleaxe of a nurse at that so do as you're told young man."
"Yes ma'am, but I'll remember it for later. Perhaps I should ask the hospital if I could borrow Theresa for a while. She treated me nicely."

Chapter 7. Mother arrives
Two hours later she was home again. David was dosing but awoke when she went in. "I need the loo Steph but the lads pushed those chairs too close together for me to get through with my crutches." She cleared the way for him. Fortunately they had a toilet downstairs as well as one next to the bedroom but they only had an upstairs bathroom. "I'll have to wash him later," she told herself as she guided him along the passageway and helped him lower his tracksuit enough to pee. "Good job he has these baggy old pants otherwise we'd have difficulty in getting his other trousers over the cast." For another hour or so she fussed over him and made dinner and by the time she'd cleared things away and washed up she felt utterly tired. David noticed. "Get undressed slave and get into bed with me. I need to feel your body again." 
Hardly had she cuddled up to him her eyes closed. David decided to let her sleep but only minutes later the phone rang. Stephanie woke and went to answer it. "It's your mother. She's just got back from Cyprus and picked up my message on her answerphone." She handed David the phone.
Even Stephanie could hear his mother's sharp voice going on for a considerable time with David interspersing only an occasional yes or no� "Yes mother, I'm fine now and I am being well looked after�She is a girl who works for me�She's been living here for over a month�No mother, there is no need for you to come down here�Steph's perfectly capable of looking�Yes, she is�In any case mother, I'm going back to work tomorrow." His mother's conversation continued for a while longer until David said, "Sorry mother, got to finish now. My battleaxe of a nurse is telling me it's time for my bath."
"There's no way you're going to work tomorrow," Stephanie told him firmly.
"Stop giving me orders slave," David laughed, "Now pull out the phone plug and get into bed alongside me. You need some rest too. It's only eight o'clock but we can lie here for a bit and when you're ready you can go upstairs to your own bed."

"Sorry I'm late Kelly. Had to wash and see to the big baby before I came and I'll have to pop back again in a couple of hours to see that he isn't getting into mischief." 
Kelly laughed, "And I bet he isn't the easiest baby to handle. It must be frustrating for him�and you too."
Her morning had started with her getting him sat on the toilet, then fixing breakfast and giving him an all over wash. That was actually a laugh because she seemed to find the places where he was most ticklish. And then of course he had an erection that needed attention. "Suck it slave," David ordered. Stephanie did and after nearly a fortnight of forced abstention, David came quickly. By the time she'd finished seeing to him and getting herself ready, it was gone nine and she already felt as though she'd done a days work.

"You are going to take me into work in the morning slave. If not I'll get a taxi and tan your arse later; I'm not spending another day cooped up here with nothing to do and no one around. At least in the hospital there were other patients to talk to and nurses to chat up. I can sit in my wheelchair and do my bit to help." David gave her his instructions forcibly and she knew she'd have to comply and in any case, provided he didn't try to overdo it, it would keep his mind occupied.
"You only want to come in to check we're all working and not sitting around drinking coffee all day. You want to be back in your slave master role again," Stephanie kidded him.
"Yes, and it sounds as if I may have to bring my whip to keep my discourteous slave in line."
Everyone seemed pleased to see him and wanted to sign his plaster cast. His presence did ease their workload a little. He could answer the phone and put the orders through but it was Stephanie that had to go out and meet a client. A job that David would normally have done.
"Where's my son?" The woman's strident voice reverberated around the office, almost drowning the noise of the machines.
"I'll tell him you're here Mrs. Benson," Tracy answered.
"No need girl, I can see him." She marched through to David's office. "Oh my God, you poor baby. What did you do to yourself? Who's looking after you? Where is that nurse you spoke of? Why are you back at work and not resting in bed? Never mind I'm here now. I can take care of you properly�"
"Mother, stop!" Mrs. Benson paused for a moment and David didn't give her the chance to continue. "Mother, I'm here because I ordered my nurse to bring me because I couldn't stand being at home alone�"
"But you won't be there alone. I'm here to look after you darling. Where's your nurse. I want to give her a piece of my mind and get you ready to go home."
"Steph's seeing a client. She'll be back in half an hour or so."
"She should be here. You're injured and she should be looking after you properly." Jennifer Benson's voice was heard, with some amusement, throughout the workplace. Fortunately the phone rang and David spent longer than really necessary answering it.
When Stephanie arrived back, Kelly whispered, "Tread carefully, his mum is here."
"Mother this is Stephanie..." David started to introduce her.
"So you're the so-called nurse who is supposed to be looking after my son and yet you go off gallivanting around and leaving him on his own to look after himself and do the work you are supposed to do. No doubt you're only with him to get into his pants when no one else will have you. You've not much in the way of assets by the looks of things. Now if you are his nurse, get him ready to go home so I can look after him. You're obviously hopeless at your job and don't know the first thing about caring for injured people."
Stephanie could feel some of her old anger rising within her but managed to suppress it. "I do what my boss tells me, ma'am. He pays my wages. If he orders me to take him home, then I will. Sir?" She gave David a quizzical look.
"Leave us for a few moments please Steph and close the door when you go out please." The ladies could hear the elderly woman's voice getting angrier even through the closed door and above the noise of the printer but they could only make out a few words.
"How did it go with the client?" Kelly asked trying to take Stephanie's mind off the woman in the next room and then knew she wouldn't succeed. "You've got problems with her Steph. She causes chaos even when David's fit. I think they had a row after she came last time and fortunately hasn't been back since. Try and keep calm but don't give in to her. She still thinks of David as a five-year-old baby boy and not a grown man of 38. She still thinks he should be married to Lisa. Lisa was a glamorous woman and more of a socialite."
Finally the office door flung open. "Bring him home when he's ready," Jennifer snapped angrily at Stephanie, "And make sure you take good care of him. At least you could make some effort at being a decent nurse however incompetent you are. I shall be looking after him from now on. Your services will not be required."
"I'm not a nursemaid! I'm only a bloody slave! A slave to him, not a bitch like you!" Stephanie burst out and turned and went into the staff toilet.
"Slave, in here now please!" David had to order her into his office before she would return. Jennifer had left but her case was still in the reception area. "You know I shall have to put you over my knee when I'm fit enough. I had thought you'd got yourself under control."
"I had thought that by now you wouldn't have allowed your mother to control you!�����Sir"
"Okay, okay Steph, get us a coffee and tell me about the meeting." David could see the fury in her eyes and knew that any further conversation on the subject would end with a row. He'd had enough of that with his mother and he'd begun to feel very tired. An hour later he asked Stephanie to take him home. It was 4:30 and it was fairly quiet so Kelly said they could manage. 
Polly helped her get David into the car and lifted his mother's case into the boot. "From the weight of this, she intends to stay for some time Steph. Don't let her get you down. And don't let her take him away from you," Polly warned.
Jennifer arrived by taxi at 5:30 and immediately began carping about everything Stephanie did. She complained about the way David was being looked after, the way the food was cooked, the state of the house, the lack of facilities in the guestroom. David unsuccessfully tried to curb his mother and by bedtime, Stephanie was in tears. She sat alone on her bed and went over the day's events. "Why can't he just tell her to piss off home? She is his mother but he's damn near forty years old. She seems to hate me for reasons I don't know of. Perhaps Kelly was right. She wants another Lisa for her son. Well I'm not married to him although it sometimes feels like it. I can leave if I want. He'd have to let me work on for a while until he's fit again or gets someone to replace me. Good job I kept the flat on. I've got some money in the bank now so I could look for another job."
"Stephanie!" Mrs. Benson pushed open the door without. "Get downstairs, David wants a word you, about your behaviour no doubt. I'm off to bed so make sure you see to him during the night. None of that getting into bed with him though. He needs his rest and a trollop like you should respect that. I know you are only doing it for the money you might get from him. You certainly wouldn't make him a suitable wife so don't get any ideas on that score." She went on for another five minutes before ordering Stephanie to hurry herself and get down and see to David.

Chapter 8. Runaway slave
"Bitch! Bitch! Bitch! She's here; she can look after her precious son. I can't take any more of this." Throwing a few items into a bag, she went to David, "I'll pick you up in the morning if you wish to go into work SIR. I'll bring the car back then if you don't. Good night SIR."
"No Steph, don't go�" Stephanie could hear him calling to her as she closed the door.
Her phone rang a few minutes after she'd entered her old flat. It now seemed a cold and uninviting place but at least it was hers and she could have her own space away from that harridan. She guessed the call was from David and cut him off when he'd only spoken a couple of words. "Let him stew. He should have done more to curb his bloody mother." Although inordinately tired, sleep wouldn't come. Stephanie tossed and turned all night and debated what she would do. Finally she decided to continue as his slave at work but to actively look for another job. "Even if the old bitch does leave, he'll always be under her influence. I suppose living with him was pleasant enough while it lasted. No I really liked it. I'm very fond of him. Perhaps I love him? Guess that it had to end sometime. Perhaps she is right, he needs someone more glamorous than me but wasn't that why he and Lisa parted? He wasn't into her glamorous way of life. Perhaps he let her put me down so much that I would leave and he could rid himself of me. Perhaps he never really wanted me. Just needed a woman to put his prick in." 
Not that far away, David was also lying awake reliving the past few weeks and asking himself what had gone so suddenly wrong. The answer he knew was, his mother. "Why did she have to come? Why did she have to be so bossy? Why can't I stand up to her? Why does she seem to hate Steph so? Why did I allow Steph to leave? Will she really turn up in the morning or will she just look for another job? She can't leave; she's a slave. No that's only a pretence that we both go along with. Why do I feel so angry with mother? Angry with Steph too. God I miss her already. Still she was always a bitch and now she's back to her old self. Efficient, cold, sharp and none too pleasant with it. Was her good side only temporary? Should I even try to get her back? No. Better to let her go. Don't want to go through all the agro I had when Lisa left. I really don't want to let Steph go though."
The alarm clock dragged Stephanie awake after what seemed only a few minutes sleep. There was nothing in the house for breakfast and only powdered milk for her morning cup of tea. "I have to start shopping for myself again." The prospect didn't please her. Cooking for one was no pleasure. "I guess I'll lose some of the pounds that I put on. Wonder if he'll be ready if I go at the usual time? No good phoning, the bitch will answer."
At 8:15 Stephanie parked the car in his drive and used her key to let herself in. David was still abed and still naked. He'd taken his tracksuit off when he got into bed and it lay on a nearby armchair where he had thrown it. "Do you wish me to drive you to work SIR?" Stephanie asked formally. "Sorry, I see you're not quite ready yet. Shall I come back later for you when your new carer has got you ready? Phone me at work SIR. I will have to take the car because I will have to deliver the Shire Living order first thing, SIR." Each time she emphasised the SIR. She smiled inwardly as she knew his other tracksuits were in the wardrobe upstairs and he wouldn't be able to get at them. His mother would have to do that. When she got up. Steph couldn't hear any other noises in the house.
"Steph, please come back�" But she had already turned and left. David fumed. He knew it would be nine o'clock at least before his mother got up. He struggled out of bed, grabbed his crutches, then dropped one and had to spend sometime 'fishing' for it with the other, At last he made it to the toilet and rinsed his face in the small washbasin. Only then did it dawn on him that he wouldn't find a change of clothing. They were still upstairs in the bedroom. "Damn you Steph. You knew that! Damn this leg! Damn that bloody motorist! Damn you mother!" He struggled into the dirty suit.
Everyone knew something was wrong when Stephanie arrived at work without David and looking angry and depressed. Tracy gave a little smirk and Stephanie turned on her, "Yes, you'll be pleased to know we had a row and I'm no longer living with him. You can chase him if you like and can put up with his bloody mother! I'm now a runaway slave." She stormed into the David's office and began sorting through the papers on his desk without really seeing them. Kelly spoke to her quietly for a few minutes but only about work but then went on, "Take Polly and deliver the order, Steph." Both of them knew that it was unnecessary for Polly to go along but Kelly thought she might be a calming influence.
Indeed she was. They delivered the order but before Polly would let her start off again she turned and spoke in her concerned way, "Tell me about it Steph. Don't bottle it up." Stephanie just broke down and cried her heart out, while Polly held her, unconcerned at what others passing in the car park thought. Finally she stuttered out all that had happened the previous day. "David is more to you than your boss now isn't he? He's more than your slave master." Polly spoke gently and received an acknowledgement that she was right. "You want him back but don't want to be the one who begs for forgiveness?" Again a 'yes' nod. "Well first you need to find out if he really wants you. You as a person; not as a slave for sex fun. If he comes into work today, play a little hard to get. Be correct and formal if you like or keep up the slave girl act as far as work goes and see if he comes begging for you to go back to him or if he keeps his mother on as a carer."
Finally David's mother arrived downstairs and another argument ensued when he was about to phone to get Stephanie to bring him to work. She tried to insist that he stayed at home but after listening to her berating Stephanie for leaving him to fend for himself overnight, for what seemed an interminable while without hardly being able to get a word in himself, his patience with her finally broke. "Shut up mother! For once in your life shut up! Your mouth has already wrecked my life and I intend to do what I can to salvage it. I'm phoning Steph." 
Jennifer looked at him in stunned silence. "Well if she means more to you than your own mother, I had better go back home. There should be a train about midday."
Kelly took the call, "Steph's out delivering the Shire Living order. She should have been back by now. Do you want her to pick you up David?"
Stephanie seemed a lot calmer when she returned. "Would you mind getting him please Kelly?" she asked, "I ought to sort through these orders. I got held up at Shire Living."
"Come in!" David yelled at the door when the bell rang. "Why didn't Steph just use her key?" He asked himself. His face fell when he saw Kelly on the doorstep. "Sorry Kelly, I was expecting Steph to just walk in."
"She's busy." Both knew that wasn't the real reason.
Although he tried several times, David never succeeded in getting Stephanie alone during the day. She attended to him with a cold formality and called him 'Sir' at every opportunity. Three times he called her into his office, and each time she insisted on the door being left wide open "I've driven her away. Mother was the last straw. She has no real love for me so I guess she did what she had to do to keep her job. She's cold shouldering my every move." At lunchtime she bought her own sandwiches and sat amidst the others to eat them. Tracy though, sat with him and chatted amiably, even though he hardly heard her words. Surreptitiously, Stephanie watched as anger mounted within her but she managed not to say anything. By mid afternoon David had had enough. Lack of sleep coupled with the side effects of the painkillers overwhelmed him. His request for Stephanie to take him home was passed on to Kelly who passed it to Barbara. Kelly really was too busy sorting out a printer problem to leave and she thought that Barbara being and older woman and a mother might be able to assist David's mother to put him to bed. Stephanie burst into tears when David left and decided to leave rather than face the others especially the smirking Tracy.
Both spent a miserable evening and a sleepless night. David would probably have got drunk had not he been warned not to drink with the medication he was on and the fact that it was difficult to walk anyway and he didn't want to fall and do more damage to his leg. Stephanie just kept weeping and moped about. She tidied her flat, dusted everything twice but didn't bother cooking anything to eat. Eventually she made some tea and found some stale biscuits and a packet of crisps. "I suppose I shall have to go there tomorrow and collect my things. I wonder how he's managing with his mother? Will she give him a sponge bath? Probably not. Let him stink. What do I care?"
Polly phoned early Saturday morning. Her greeting, "How you doing Steph?" just brought a flood of tears. Rather than embarrass Polly, Stephanie put the phone down.

Chapter 9. Recaptured
"Dammit, who's ringing the bell at this time of the morning? I've already had to struggle to the door to pay the paper girl." David was not in a good mood. Once more he hopped to the door on his crutches. "Poll. What do you and your friend want? Are you going to be a Good Samaritan and help me for a bit? I'm still struggling to get up. Are you on your way to Tesco's? If so I could do with some things."
"No, David. Pete and me are going to take you on a raiding party to recapture a runaway slave. Where's your shoes and coat? Pete can drive."
"No Polly. She doesn't want me�"
"Stop that stupid nonsense. Of course she wants you. You just need to take control of her again. She doesn't know your mother's left. She went home before Barbara came back and put the phone down on me this morning." Twenty minutes later they parked at the rear of Stephanie's apartment block. "She's on the first floor David so the difficult part will be getting you up those stairs. They haven't yet put in disabled access but the stairs are wide and shallow. We did a check on the way to yours. Pete's a strong lad and will help you up. Once she opens the door, we follow Pete's plan. Okay?"
"Supposing she calls the police? Supposing she really hates my guts?"
"Supposing she loves you to hell? If you don't try this, you'll never know," Pete countered.
Polly rang Stephanie's doorbell and stood in front of the peephole. The door opened for the length of the security chain. "Leave me Poll, please. I don't wish to talk with anyone at the moment. I just want to be left alone. No one can help."
"Yes you do need to talk Steph and I can help. Open the door, you need someone to take control of you again before you really go to pieces. Let me in please, or do you want me to shout and scream so all your neighbours come running out," Polly threatened. As soon as the door opened Pete forced his way in and grabbed her. Polly followed and David hobbled after.
Stephanie struggled but was no match for Pete. She would have screamed but Pete had a hand across her mouth. Her eyes showed shock at seeing David here in her flat. "Are you going to behave yourself slave Stephanie Jones? Or do we have to tie you up and gag you?" David asked, trying to make his voice sound angry and fierce. Still in shock, Stephanie made no move to reply even when Pete momentarily removed his hand. "Okay Polly see what you can find to tie this slave up."
"Nooo!" Stephanie shook her head free, "I'll do what you want�You can't do this�How?�" Pete dumped her in a chair and stood behind her, resting his hands on her shoulders to keep her from jumping up. "What are you going to do?� How did�?" Stephanie looked frightened but at the same time she knew Polly wouldn't let them harm her. She must have a plan.
"Slave Stephanie Jones you are guilty of running away from your master and absenting your duties. You will be taken from here to the place where you should reside and there be punished in full consideration of the severity of your actions at this time." David tried to sound like a judge passing a long-term sentence.
"Your mother will never allow it!!
"I sent her home yesterday, so she will have no say in the matter."
"You can't force me!"
"No? No, and I don't really want to. I would like you to come sort of willingly." Stephanie knew exactly what he meant.
"So if I refuse, you'll set these two on me and they'll drag me away by my hair!" Stephanie was now smiling.
"Yep, that's they way it is, slave. Now get the things you need together and my security staff will escort you to the car to start serving your sentence."
"How did you get up here David?" Stephanie asked.
"With great difficulty," Pete butted in, "And with a little help from his friends."
"And some friend you are Poll. Arranging to have me abducted just when I thought of was free of my slave master." There was more than the hint of a smile when she said it. David was trying to hug her and still balance himself on his crutches.

Monday morning, Stephanie sat gingerly on her seat. "My bum's still tender." She clearly remembered the events of Saturday. The heart stopping moment when David's crutch slipped on the stair and he almost went down. Fortunately Pete caught him. It made her realise the effort David had had to put in to get to her place. Polly and Pete left immediately they arrived at David's home. "Slave Steph, I know I smell but I think we ought to get your punishment out of the way before doing anything else. Help me undress and then strip off yourself and lie across the bed. I wish I could have you over my knee again but that's not practical at the moment. I trust you are not going to resist or run away again. This spanking will wipe your slate completely clean and we can start afresh."
"My God, he did spank me this time. Thirty or forty hard ones but I was determined not to move or run away. I couldn't help crying though. And the way he kept reciting my 'sins' as he spanked. And when he came to my shouting abuse at his mother, he only gently patted me. But, oh was I glad when it was over and he hugged and kissed away my tears. How I wished he could fuck me properly but the best we could do was sixty-nining. Still that was nice and I began to feel loved and wanted again. Good job those cycling mates of his didn't turn up half an hour earlier! I'd just managed to dress and get a pair of his baggy tracksuit trousers on him when they rang the bell and then it was all laughter and making tea and stuff. There wasn't any biscuits left but Ray ran to the corner shop and got a couple of packets. "You can't have morning tea without chocolate biscuits," he laughed. We all laughed too. I expect David, like me hadn't bothered to cook Saturday night and just snacked on biscuits. Poor David, he did seem so exhausted when they all left, that I had to put him to bed and go shopping on my own. He wanted to come, more I think to make sure I came back, but I acted the bossy nurse part and insisted he lie down.
"Everything okay Steph?" Polly's voice brought her back to the present.
"Yes, Poll. Thanks. I think it should be thanks but there are times I sit down, that I'm not so sure." They both laughed and when she looked around the others were laughing too.
