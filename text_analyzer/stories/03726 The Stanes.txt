I cuddled into Sam, her shapely curves cushioning me. The travel rug was our
  only modesty as we were bumped about on the backseat, the smooth leather providing
  no traction under our bare-asses. We had been travelling down twisting single-track
  roads for hours. We passed the last house around 10 miles back (if you could
  call it a house; a ramshackle croft turned holiday cottage, waiting out the
  lonely months till the life spark returned). We had seen no signs of life other
  than a few small herds of bedraggled goats, sheltering behind crags. 
We peered ahead into the gloom as the car slowed. The waxing demon moon was
  just starting to show her face, the faint red glow felt eerily appropriate
  for the night we had planned ahead. I made a swift study of Col's handsome
  profile as he swung the car off the road onto a dirt track. His strong stern
  face suited his muscular, if stocky build. On first impression Col looks like
  he was born for the military, but while he was a strict disciplinarian by nature,
  a fighter he was not, or at least not in the physical sense of the word. 
�We're here�, he said a few minutes later. He drew the car under the partial
  camouflage of a dark copse. The trees provided sufficient cover for our purposes,
  in the remote likelihood of anyone else traversing the isolated countryside
  at that time of night. 
�OK, out you get girls�, said Jay; the dim gloom hiding his features, but
  highlighting his height and outlining his slender, yet strong, frame. Jay is
  my life-mate; ours souls are linked on another plain. His wily-strength and
  verging-on gaunt features, rough with stubble, are reminiscent of an ancient
  gunslinger from the west. His kind nature and cunning vast intellect are a
  constant source of intrigue and pleasure for me. 
We stumbled out the backseat and the cool night air cut through us like a
  knife, our nipples immediately standing out, hard and insistent in the almost
  wintry nip. Looking up the stars sparkling on a bed of inky black velvet (a
  far cry from the ambient peachy ethereal glow of the city we were used to)
  sullied only by the blood red glow of the rising moon, her full face nearly
  present now, I let out the breath I had been unintentionally holding; the evening
  had begun. 
Jay grabbed my loose long brown hair and wrapped the length around his fist,
  using it to pull me down to the earth. The intense pain made me react quickly,
  the damp grass and dirt felt slippery and gritty beneath me, with sharp twigs
  prodding and wet slimy leaves slurping across my skin. 
He pulled my arms roughly behind my back and loosed my hair as he crouched
  down behind my head. I felt a coarse rough rope looping around my wrists, binding
  my arms, rendering them useless and me partially helpless. As he got up to
  move around to my front, I glanced over to where Sam was receiving the same
  treatment from Col and caught her eye, we smiled in mutual anticipation and
  I watched as Col started to wrap the uneven hemp rope around her leg just under
  the knee; the start of her leg rope. Jay had almost finished mine, he had left
  me enough rope for a small stride, just the right amount to be a hindrance
  but not a severely limiting; we had a long walk ahead of us. 
Sam and I waited on the ground while the boys got their packs and locked up
  the car, we were eager to be going to try and warm up a bit, even summer nights
  in Scotland were cold and the wind was straight off the North sea, bitingly
  bitter at best. 
They helped us to our feet and we all started along the path leaving the copse
  and the car behind us. We could walk double on the faint track and Sam and
  I took the point, or rather our nipples did! We set as quick a pace as our
  bindings allowed, which wasn't fast, and made progress towards the gloomy,
  slightly rising, slope that heralded the start of our journey to the Stanes.
  The Pictish site is remote and isolated, perfect for our ceremony. 
We had been walking for some time and I was starting to feel the effort of
  traipsing barefoot and restrained. The coarse springy heather was catching
  at my ankles and the sharp tufts of tough grass were biting at my soles and
  heels. The landscape was heather as far as the eye could see, interspersed
  with large boulders, like rocks arising from a sea. Trees lined the distance
  on the right and ahead lay a steep hill, the top shrouded by the cloak of darkness.
  The moon, a large orange discus now, was full and ominous, rising to take her
  position as shining head of the sky. 
Suddenly I heard a SWOOSH and felt a stinging brand of pain flash across my
  bum. Jay had picked up a thin whippy branch, to offer some �gentle� encouragement,
  the ache in my legs a minor discomfort compared to the searing welt forming
  on my backside. I heard a second SWOOSH and smiled as Sam got the same treatment.
  We picked up the pace and the boys grinned as they kept up the punishment,
  I could feel my excitement start to build and the delicious pain in my nether
  regions was threatening to consume my thoughts. 
As we started on the almost vertical slope, the boys moved closer behind each
  of us to offer any assistance we might need. The going was strenuous, but not
  dangerous, that being said it was difficult to climb with our restraining bonds.
  At one point we needed the boys to carry us, Jay climbed up with both the packs
  first, while Col hoisted Sam over his shoulder and started to ascend. I waited
  at the bottom, I could see Jay at the top waiting for me and I felt moisture
  seep between my thighs as I looked at him in the moonlight, wondering what
  delights were in store for all of us that evening. 
Jay left to grab Sam for the rest of the way and I could see Col making his
  way back down for me, I moved closer to let him grab my thighs and hoist me
  over his shoulder. I could feel the rough material of his shirt scratch against
  my nipples and his strong muscular shoulder was digging into my crotch. As
  he climbed, I swayed gently across his back, my need growing with every movement,
  the yearning for pinching biting pain on my nipples and receiving nothing but
  scratchy light contact, was making the entire tips of my breasts burn with
  aching desire. 
I felt Jay's finger roughly push between my ass cheeks for a quick fondle
  before he hoisted me up the final section. It was too steep to manoeuvre with
  someone over your shoulder. Col helped a little by pushing up from below, my
  attraction to him was so strong I couldn't help feeling a tingle of warmth
  in my groin, at his fleeting touch. The end was in sight; the dark silhouettes
  of the stones were prominent in a clearing of dark slender firs. 
Sam and I hobbled along the path and counted nine stones evenly placed in
  a large circle as we entered the mystical surround. The beautiful face of the
  moon in full glory with a slightly pinkish hue as her bottom grazed the swaying
  treetops. The stones appeared slightly dappled in this light and the magical
  feeling that had drenched us as we entered, grew as we drew near to the centre
  of the power. The grass was soft and only slightly damp underfoot; it felt
  like a cool lush carpet on our tortured soles. 
The boys had us kneel while they removed the ropes from our arms, it felt
  good to have them free and we both started to shake them out, after we had
  recovered from the cramp of having them in one position for a period of time.
  They left us with the packs in the centre of the circle and went off in search
  of firewood. 
�This is Amazing�, said Sam, over her shoulder as she opened one of the packs
  and started to unload candles. I admired her form as she gracefully took the
  items out and placed them on the nearby ground. Her curly blond hair was bouncing
  around her head and I laughed as she kept sweeping it out the way. Her large
  breasts were swaying too; I couldn't help but stare at the huge milky white
  globes, sitting proudly, high and upturned. I could imagine sucking and caressing
  the gorgeous stiff pink nipples, hard now with cold, but later with need. 
�I know, I can't believe how much effort the boys have gone to, I mean, look
  at all this stuff�, I answered, as I extracted piles of rough hemp rope and
  some curious leather bundles from Jay's pack. I started to unwrap the largest
  of the bundles. The smell of leather is an aphrodisiac to me and I took a moment
  to inhale the hardworking aroma, allowing it to whisk me away to memories of
  pleasure. The heavy object soon slipped free of its wrappings, the polished
  metal glinting in the moonlight. �Sam, look at this�, I whispered, holding
  up the beautiful ornamented chalice for her inspection, feeling the need to
  respect its beauty with an awed silence. 
I passed it over so she could get a closer look. �This must have been really
  heard to find�, she said. She ran her fingers over the intricate celtic knotwork
  design around the rim. It was impressive, but I was not surprised at it, I
  knew Jay had been planning this trip for ages and he had spent a lot of time
  of Ebay lately! 
It was perfect for the ceremony we had planned; tonight we would be as one. �Two
  couples joined and mirrored to four corners of a perfect square. Coming together
  for that night only, to exceed the sum of our parts, to connect to a different
  plain, a journey to the spirit world where none venture anymore.' Well that
  was Jay's description anyway, the rest of us were happy to go along for the
  undoubtedly fun and mind-blowing ride, most things involving Jay involved these
  two elements as well. 
�Jay said he wanted candles over by the two biggest stones, he said to put
  them in a rough large semi circle around the bases� I called over to Sam. She
  set off with a bundle of candles and a box of matches. I heard the boys tramping
  around the undergrowth and guessed we had a bit of time yet. I grabbed the
  bottle of red wine and the cup and went over to help Sam secure the candles
  in the ground and light them. 
I poured the wine into the chalice and placed the full cup and the remainder
  of the bottle in front of the stones. I positioned them directly between the
  two like an offering, as I had been instructed. I then busied myself with stabbing
  the candles into the ground. I heard the breaking of branches and the swishing
  of tramping feet get louder, as Jay and Col returned with armfuls of dry firewood.
  Col was also dragging a huge branch behind him, it had hundred of smaller branches
  protruding; sufficient fuel for the whole evening and I admired their strength
  for bringing such a massive weight. 
Jay starting setting a fire while Sam and I broke off small twigs for kindling.
  Col went over and grabbed the pile of ropes before going to investigate the
  alter-like area that was beginning to emerge, the two large stones as focal
  points and the remainder of the circle creating an ethereal border of protection
  and security. 
Jay got the bonfire going and in no time at all and Sam and I were starting
  to heat up from our chilly walk. I looked around the clearing, the blaze highlighting
  and shadowing objects in its flickering glow. The seven smaller columns of
  stone and the two large behemoths were reminiscent of a bejewelled-ring shape.
  Thick red candles shaped in a semi circle around the two great hunks of primordial
  rock, outlining and projecting a focal point to the key energy of the encirclement.
  The moon was gleaming bright white now, almost gazing down on us from her apex;
  it was time to begin. 
*** 
Jay grabbed me and pushed me face first against the slightly larger of the
  two stones, the rough cold stone was hard and sore against my breasts, my cheek
  was pressed flat against the rock and I could smell the musky cool scent of
  earth and age upon the surface. 
He quickly wrapped rope around my wrist and drew my arm around the boulder
  in a wicked embrace, he grabbed my other arm and before long I was hugging
  the huge rock. The angular outcrops cut into my arms and grazed my skin as
  I felt my legs forcefully spread and attached around the base, leaving me helpless.
  Sam was undergoing a similar fate beside me, our heads were facing each other,
  and I couldn't hep moan as I looked into her eyes and saw my desire mirrored. 
The plan was simple; we were to have a lattice of belt marks all across the
  back of our bodies. Jay would make all the marks going from top left to bottom
  right and Col would make all the closing marks, top right to bottom left. They
  would each do one of us then swap so we had corresponding yet opposite welts;
  a symmetrical yet mirrored pattern. 
Jay stood behind me with his belt raised as I anticipated the first blow,
  unable to do anything but think of its impeding arrival. The solid rock beneath
  me gave me a tangible link to the earth and I gripped it tightly as I heard
  the sweeping swoosh of the leather cutting through the air, a short sound drawn
  out in my mind as if I were at the epicentre of the spinning world slowed by
  my consciousness. The burning fiery line of pain bit across my back and I gasped,
  sucking in a taste of the age of the ancient granite beneath me. 
My breath quickened into gasping pants as more blows rained down, like a goldfish
  gulping when extracted from its normally watery atmosphere, I struggled for
  life-giving oxygen. The piercing pain of the blows is sweet ecstasy, it conveys
  me up to the apex of agony and throws me into the cushioning cloud. The puffy
  wasps float me to the place where I feel the blows as rhythmic thuds, like
  a drumbeat urging me on and on before the exquisite ride takes hold again,
  this time sending me further, higher before the cloud wraps around in its luxurious
  cotton embrace. I have no sense of the physical, the mental takes control and
  my mind soars. 
All too soon Jay was finished and Col took up his stance behind me, I glimpsed
  over at Sam but she was too far away in her in world to see me, I soon found
  the reason why. Col's muscular stocky build gave him a shorter but more powerful
  stroke; I could feel the difference immediately, more force on impact resulting
  in a more intense roller-coaster voyage. 
Once again I could feel the pain clawing at my soul, threatening to consume
  me, but the time in the changeover had given me a few minutes to realise the
  throbbing need in my breasts and clitoris. A blow would land, I felt the thud
  and then the sting the fire would then spread with fast tentacles across my
  skin, consuming me. The impact sent my thoughts shooting, like a dart, directly
  to the three disconnected burning centres on my front that seemed to arise
  from my sea of sensation, like tall iron spikes from a fuzzy haze. The grating
  of the rough stone as my body rebounded against it, was almost too much to
  bear. The sandpaper-like surface tore layers from my nipples, leaving raw sensitive
  nerves that were conduits to the pleasure centre in my brain. My internal vision
  would snap back as each blow struck, then would immediately bounce to the effects
  on my front. Col took me further than Jay had ever done before, I had always
  sensed that Jay held back to protect me, I felt none of that unwanted restraint
  here. Each strike sent me on an overloading whirlwind of awareness, driving
  me wild. I needed to be fucked soon, the aching need clamoured to be filled. 
I hadn't realised that Col had stopped until I felt his body pressing against
  my back of fire and his caressing breath upon my cheek. He whispered in my
  ear, �Well done little girl� I shivered at his voice, my floating mind used
  the sound as point of reference, an anchor to return me to the moment and my
  inner-core purred in satisfaction at the feeling of being dominated by such
  a strong force. I felt his hand reach between my legs, my excitement obvious
  in the multiple streams of telling release running down the rock face, like
  rivers of passion. I felt his strong fingers pushing up inside me; my body
  immediately gripped around them as I peaked in orgasm. All the pain, all the
  fire, all of me, centred in on one singular point, like my whole being was
  rolled into a cone the point of which burst a massive bulging balloon of endorphins
  that exploded obliterating my universe. 
I felt Col start to undo the grasping bonds holding my arms. I gripped the
  rock to keep my balance as he untied my feet, the pull of gravity was a stronger
  force multiplied by my weakness and I was struggling to hold myself up. Col
  nursed me to a fuzzy reality and helped me turn around. He then had me lower
  to a seating position on the ground, my raw fiery back resting against the
  stone; the rock cooling and soothing on my burning welts for an instant before
  turning to awareness as the uneven surface, scratchy with lichen, made its
  presence felt. 
When we were both seated Col and Jay went over to put some more wood on the
  fire. My glazed eyes watched without thinking as the glowing fiery trail of
  burning embers spiralled into the sky, dancing and winking like devil fairies
  flying off into the night, reaching up to the luminescent face of the moon,
  her glowing face ever watchful as she reached her zenith. 
We got to our knees as they returned and kneeled in front of us, the offering
  wine and chalice at the centre of our quadrangle, the candles creating a smaller
  arc and the stones completing a bigger ring. We could all feel the power of
  the moment; all shapes were complete all cycles of the earth were about to
  be reborn. We had travelled our senses and had been returned to an altered
  state of higher awareness; each individual leaf rustling in the breeze, entwined
  to generate a roaring ocean of sound every nuance was amplified in our sensitive
  existence. We each placed a finger on the rim of the cup and our other hand
  of the shoulder of the person sitting next to us, we started to hum under our
  breath, the combined noise, vibrating our bodies and resonating in our souls,
  bonding our spirits and linking us on the path of hedonistic discovery. 
Jay leaned forward and lifted the gleaming ceremonial object; filled with
  blood red liquid, it's inky oily substance highlighted and reflected, amplified
  by the moonlit glow. 
�I give this as the owner� he said as he brought the ornamental vessel to
  my lips. I leaned forward to receive a sip; our joining formed a diagonal across
  the square points of our group. �I take this as the owned� I answered, licking
  a drip of the sweet pungent liquid from my lips. He reverently returned the
  chalice to the centre and we leaned back to our previous upright positions. 
Col gripped the chalice with purpose. I was spellbound as I watched Sam lean
  forward, her beautiful white skin pale and radiant in the moonlight. Her heavy
  breasts swung forward and I could see that she was excited as me, her nipples
  were straining and her legs were shining with wetness. �I give this as the
  owner� said Col as he touched the cup to Sam's lips. A little wine escaped
  as she sipped, the rivulets of blood red a sharp contrast to her creamy alabaster
  skin. Col leaned forward and caught the drip with his tongue as it reached
  her nipple. I heard her release a gasp as he followed the trail up her chest,
  lapping the droplets and increasing her desire. �I take this as the owned� she
  whispered breathlessly. 
Col picked up the cup and looked into my eyes, I could see his desire and
  attraction, but that did not threaten or intrude upon my love for Jay, it merely
  added to it. We leaned in, my body responding to his look, my heart beating
  and a warm wetness throbbing at my epicentre. �I give this as the higher� he
  said �I take this as the lower� I replied lowering my eyes in subservience,
  my mind cowering in submission and my heart thumping in desire. 
Jay picked up the chalice and turned to Sam, he held it to her lips and said �I
  give this as the higher� he commanded. She whispered �I take this as the lower�.
  I could see the affection in their eyes, but it was a bond of friendship and
  primitive sexual attraction that held them, not one of love. 
The desire to join had been expressed, requested and released into the ether.
  It felt like it should be heralded with trumpets from the rooftops of the sky,
  but the sense of completion was a magical melody that wound about the clearing,
  almost palpable in our enlightened state. 
Col grabbed my arms and wrenched me upright. He pushed me back forcefully
  against the unmoving unforgiving mineral and leaned in close to press me firmly
  against it with his body. I could feel his iron hardness pushing insistently
  against my pussy. I experienced a shearing surge as his teeth bit and sucked
  at my neck and I gave in to the overwhelming rush of pleasure. His well-defined
  hard chest pushed against my nipples sending tingles and twinges of excitement
  directly to my clitoris. I felt it throb relentlessly, only needing to feel
  a feather-touch to unleash the explosion unceasingly growing there. I groaned
  as he moved away, desperate for him to allow me release. I felt him pull my
  arms back around the rock and felt him wind the coarse hemp rope around my
  wrists binding me once again to the ancient pillar. This position made my breasts
  and pussy become prominently exposed and displayed, obvious outthrust targets
  begging for attention. I could feel a breeze rush over me and it aroused the
  tingly excitement in my nipples and clitoris further, further than the most
  distant point on my limited human horizon. 
I stared as Col pulled a candle from the ground. The wax pooled around the
  wick like liquid mercury massing and the flame flickered and spat in protest
  at the movement. I watched, enthralled as he lifted the candle above my left
  breast and in slow motion tilted the length gently to release the hot liquid.
  I watched, detached as the droplets fell, I had time to study each perfectly
  formed tear, as they gravitated in their downward journey towards my nipple.
  The pink flesh hard and thrust out as if eager to receive its bounty, an uncontrollable
  betrayal to my psyche. 
The first droplet hit and I felt a surging mental pain as the perfection of
  shape was destroyed, ruined from its glorious form. I saw the splash as a third-party
  observer, not aware of the reality, yet. The clear wax splayed across my erect
  nubbin, but the physical pain was delayed, as the splash gripped my skin I
  felt it heat, gaining in intensity as its hold tightened across my tender flesh
  and burned. I exploded in every direction; the agony sent a rush of endorphins
  to my mind and a rush of moisture to my pussy. The orgasm gripped me and more
  beads of hell rained down keeping me on the level and drawing my pleasure out,
  like taffy pulled with huge sugar hook. 
Col stood back to admire his handy work, I could see an evil look of satisfaction
  on his face and the gleam in his eyes made me shudder, I wondered what he was
  thinking as he gazed at my body, pearlescent in the moonlight. The look was
  like a window to his thoughts and I shivered to think what vile schemes culminated
  in that gaze. My body was opened wide for his gaze, my skin taut and quivering
  for his ministrations. The red wax attached in rivulets like blood clinging
  to marble, my large heavy breasts holding my pink stiff nipples up as a repentant
  slave making an offering to their master. I gave him a desperate look, begging
  him back; imploring with my soul for the attention I craved. My mind resisted
  giving itself to one that was not it's master, but my body betrayed me; I could
  not hide my primeval instincts. 
He moved his instrument of torture, the flame flickering, over to the other
  breast. I cried out, in my mind I shouted No, but the only sound that exited
  was a wailing nonsensical noise of need straight from my soul, the droplets
  rained on, each a pear-shaped pearl of torture. The fiery pain made me scream
  in anguish. He moved forward and his strong fingers evilly pinched my tormented
  nipples, each twist sent a new cocktail of pleasure and pain washing over my
  body. 
My glazed eyes focussed on a glinting silver dagger that he drew from a hidden
  pocket, the pale moonbeams reflected on the blade and seemed to dance before
  my eyes. I held my breath as he slowly trailed the tip across my flesh. I could
  feel my hair rising and goose bumps forming as the hairline path of the cool
  steel drew itself across my tortured skin, creating an electric circuit of
  anticipation surging towards my erect nipples, the rapier point cut through
  the waxy residue and flakes fell away as he made me realise just how helpless
  I was. He swiftly moved the knife and in a quick flash he cut the bonds attaching
  my hands to the monolith. He grabbed my hair and dragged me to the ground,
  he quickly stripped as I lay quivering with craving for his touch, I was ready
  for him; my pussy was dripping, yearning for him, aching to be stretched and
  filled. 
The first shocking punch exploded in my crotch, the agony was delayed as my
  mind processed the blow, his fist made a wet slapping noise as it struck, again
  my primitive responses betrayed me, I could not control my animal cravings
  around this strong dominating man. His failing fists were deceptive to the
  control stored in every strike, he continued to pummel my pussy, the soft receptive
  flesh bearing the full force of his powerful clouts, the pain was indescribable,
  I felt like a fire had been kindled in my soul and my mind catapulted into
  sweet mindless oblivion. 
My head lay listlessly on the grass, my glazed eyes staring into the ether.
  My focus was turned inwards, though my point of focus was a distant point on
  the horizon that I stared at without comprehension. My senses realigned, my
  sight returned and a fuzzy image started to take shape. Col, strong and masterful,
  was bearing over me, owning me with his presence. Further away I could see
  my beloved Jay buried deep into Sam, she was on her knees as he drilled his
  length into her from behind. Her gorgeous breasts were bouncing at every thrust
  and the look of passion and lust on her face was an aphrodisiac beyond description. 
My pussy was throbbing with tenderness, the force of his clouts enough to
  make the whole region swell. Telltale moisture was leaking down my legs, as
  I lay on the grass, used and desperate to be fucked. All I could dream of was
  a huge cock to fill and split me, he spat on my pussy but I was too full of
  need to feel degraded, I didn't care what he did I needed him so badly. The
  head of his cock pushed against me, demanding entrance, it was almost too much
  to bear, the harsh beating had intensified all feelings to a point of overload,
  the slightest touch would be enough to drive me over the edge. 
I felt his cock slowly slide sensuously to my centre, every fraction of movement
  completing a circuit of pleasure that resulted in my gripping and sucking him
  in further. It felt like he pushed for an age, a constant length that relentlessly
  continued on deep into my elan. I could take it no more, the heat from my groin
  spread and I felt waves of intense bliss spread out to control every inch of
  my body, rising to block out my mind, building to a peak of extremes, then
  bursting as a dam collapsing under the full force of the ocean. Again and again
  I felt him thrust, each drive probing deeper than the last. I gripped Col tightly
  as I felt his seed rising; his cock pulsed and seemed to reach even further
  into my depths, as I was sent over the precipice of pleasure again. 
The swirling heaving masses of emotion cleared from my eyes and the clear
  piercing light of the moon drew my gaze like a magnet, her beautiful face ever
  watchful, she was waning and starting her descent to graze the treetops once
  more. The fresh night air gusted over my body, awakening my senses and sending
  shivers of goose bumps all over my flesh. I heard the keen hooting of a distant
  night owl, no doubt doing his nightly rounds as sentry of the wood, as I turned
  my gaze to Col's prostate spent body. His strong muscular upper body was covered
  in a thin sheen of sweat; defining his shape and highlighting his physical
  fitness making him gleam like a moonlit Adonis. I caught my breath at the arousal
  he invoked in me, I had just experienced some of the most mind-blowing orgasms
  of my life and yet I still wanted more, my body seemingly not fully satisfied
  yet. 
I turned my gaze to Jay and Sam, they were both lying on the grass staring
  at the sky, they held hands in a picture of youthful love, but their connection
  stemmed from apparent experience. The spectacle was a wonder to behold, Jay's
  lean tall muscular body a sharp contrast to Sam's shorter curvy stature. Her
  large breasts were red and covered with teeth indentations; I indulgingly smiled
  at Jay's handiwork, having been on the receiving end of that particular delight
  on many occasions. I let my mind wander to thoughts of how enjoyable it was
  to have him lock on to a nipple with a bulldog like gnash and I felt my spent
  body stir. 
I willed life back into my limbs and crawled over to Sam, her crimson chest
  calling me like a beacon, the bright scarlet made a dramatic statement against
  her milky skin and I took a second to admire it before leaning in to gently
  blow cool air across the searing surface. A moan escaped her lips as I traced
  my tongue across the underside of the mound, slowly tracing a trail of electricity
  up to her nipple. My lips encased the stiff head and she issued another moan
  as I flicked my tongue across the tip. I suckled, revelling in the fullness
  and goodness of her. Her breathing intensified and out the corner of my eye
  I saw both men watching us with interest. 
The exhibitionist in me took hold and I decided to put on a display for the
  resting masters. I let my hair fall, the long brown strands curling their length
  as they rained down on Sam's luscious form. I moved up her body letting my
  nipples graze hers, to lock her into a soul-searching kiss. I had dreamed of
  lapping and caressing her full lips for a long time and I wanted to honour
  her exquisiteness that night. I felt the heat from her chest radiate to mine;
  passion arced between us like electricity, leaving and receiving at our two
  most extreme tips, I could almost hear the fizzle and crackle in the silent
  night and my pussy throbbed and called to me relentlessly. 
Movement caught my attention and I opened my eyes to admire Jay as he went
  over to heave heavy logs to feed the dying blaze. Once again the glowing fiery
  devil fairies took flight, their deep primeval colour stirring guttural memory
  of gruff hunter-gatherers from a long forgotten time. I felt the love of the
  evening radiate from all of us, four points of power, joined to become more
  than the sum of their parts. The imposing stone circle acting as a boundary
  to the power, reflecting the vigour inwards to amplify the original force. 
Sam had returned from her distant journey of ardour, she locked my eyes in
  her glorious gaze and I felt my love intensify, my need clearly showing as
  I burned inside. I moved down her body, leaving a burning trail of kisses from
  her neck to her abdomen, each kiss resulted in a flutter and each flutter resulted
  in my intensified desire. I slowly ran my tongue down past her thrusting mound
  and down to the inside of her leg. Her pussy was puffy and gaping, resplendent
  red with use and abuse, I could see rivulets running down her folds and couldn't
  resist moving in to taste with the tip of my tongue. 
The delicious pink flesh spread open, like glistening petals, gleaming in
  front of me as I gazed at her innermost folds. I took a second to imprint this
  vision to memory so I could recount the experience to Jay later, her labia
  were puffy and engorged like fat wings, perfectly framing the angry deep crimson
  of her distended clitoris. I used the flat of my tongue to slowly lick up the
  outside of her inner lips, I felt Sam twitch under my ministrations and I blew
  a little air to stimulate her further; my tongue headed straight for its target,
  the throbbing red cluster of nerve-endings that would make Sam explode when
  stimulated. 
As I licked and lapped at those delicious folds of flesh, I saw Col moving
  towards us, chalice in hand. His graceful movement belying his burly mass,
  he drew up beside us and I involuntarily drew my breath at his huge cock gleaming
  threateningly, the girth of that massive throbbing angry tool a sight to behold
  and one that would remain with me for life. He raised the vessel and let a
  small amount of the thick burgundy liquid escape; I caught the cascade as it
  splashed over Sam's prone form, the sweet pungent aroma filling me with an
  inner-warmth. 
The blood-like wine swept its way down the easiest route, streaming in rivulets
  over her quivering folds, heading straight for her clitoris. I pursed my lips
  around the nubbin and nibbled gently suckling at the thick syrupy liquid, I
  felt a shock course through her body and my own body shook with empathy. I
  felt her strong warm thighs grip my head in a lock of passion and I gasped
  as I felt sturdy familiar fingers squeezing my butt cheeks, the gasp acted
  as a touch paper to a firework and Sam's writhing form made a glorious sight
  in the moonlit fire-bathed surround, the flickering flames dancing in the shadows,
  casting fork-tongued figures for sparkling seconds over her heaving breasts
  and flailing form. Her golden hair was alive and whirling around her attractive
  features, the fire glow magnifying the glorious shimmering hayfield. 
Jay's hands were insistently kneading my bum, which, tied with the concentration
  of sensation from Sam served as re-ignition of my own needs. I felt the warmth
  build from deep within as Jay's finger started to inch its way into the tight
  ring of my ass. My muscles contracted around his invasive digit, constricting
  access, he just increased the pressure and I felt a moan escape my lips as
  the second finger started to pursue the first. I lapped at Sam's pussy with
  a renewed vigour, she groaned nonsensically and I saw that Col was wickedly
  twisting and pulling her enflamed nipples to further speed her to new heights
  of exquisite senselessness. 
Jay's intruding fingers had taken on a steady rhythm as they pumped into my
  darkest depths; he increased the speed as I pushed my butt back, eager to receive
  more. My gaze was drawn to Col's handsome face leaning in to suck on Sam's
  enlarged angry teats, the intensity of his admiring gaze was focussed solely
  on Sam and the love that flowed between them was obvious and almost palpable
  on this most powerful of evenings. 
I felt the hot throbbing head of Jay's cock demanding entrance to my ass as
  I watched enthralled by the scene laid before me, hungrily consuming every
  detail, as a starving man would devour a feast of exquisite delights, memorising
  and savouring every aspect. I felt his pulsing scorching iron rod breach the
  barrier of muscle and push deep inside of me, the burning searing sensation
  was followed quickly by an overloading surge of emotional and sensational information,
  like a bullet of passion searing towards its target and detonating on impact,
  making thousands of lights ignite in my brain like fireworks. 
Jay gripped my hips and pulled me with him as he rolled down to lie on the
  ground, his thick cock pinioning me to him like an impaled marionette, helpless
  against his authority. As we rolled I saw Col wrap his fist in Sam's hair,
  using the delicate sun-streaked locks as a leash to pull her up and slapping
  her breasts and ass with his powerful hands to move her into a kneeling position,
  much the same as an owner would control a delinquent dog. I watched as he manoeuvred
  her head to face my crotch and held my breath as he shoved her forward, the
  intention clear. My clitoris pulsed with pleasure as her lips found mine, my
  whole groin alight with sensation as Jay's massive cock buried itself deep
  into my ass. 
The view was amazing and the feelings overwhelming as Col lined himself up
  with Sam's upturned ass. He gave a guttural yell of satisfaction and ownership,
  as he thrust into her causing her to moan, groan and thrash in a frenzy, her
  face slammed into my pussy causing me to buck uncontrollably on Jay's imbedded
  penis, driving him further home and causing me to scream in agonising delight
  and him to roar. The combined cry of our mutual offering resonated from the
  stone sentries; encircling the ancient ring, completing the bonding and the
  joining of the four.
