Synopsis: This story will borrow places from a game mod called A Dance With Rogues that was made by this cool girl called Valine. It�s a great mod. If you have the game Neverwinter Nights, I highly suggest you try out the mod. Just google it.   Anyways, the protagonist Miriam�s world (or rather the world Valine created) is a world where might generally makes right. Kings and Queens rule city states. Mercenaries and magic abound. Yep. That means, no guns, computers, air conditioning, or Wal Mart. So in other words, think back to Roman/Greek era, but dress the women up with stuff like leather and skirts rather than togas, stick in those Greek gods, and add in some medieval torture devices� yep. Anyways I�m getting carried away. This story isn�t going to be sex filled though it will have a lot of sex. As you can imagine there�s going to be lots of fighting too and Miriam is going to learn a lot about trust and friendship and all that other stuff.

So I guess, if you don&#8217;t like anything that involves swords and magic, this might not be for you. Though to be honest, I don&#8217;t intend to spend too much time on any fighting. Maybe a little on magic.

Miriam&#8217;s Dance with Rogues
Intro
I shivered as a sudden downpour of rain drenched me. Again. It had been raining intermittently all day. My black armor plated leather corset hugged my skin and repelled the rain, but like most corsets, it bared a large amount of cleavage. The top of the corset barely covered my nipples, and rain water dripped down my cleavage, causing an uncomfortable chill between my breasts. My dark brown skirt was calf length, but had wide slits up to my waist on both sides of the skirt. These slits provided maneuverability and exposed most of my legs. Unfortunately, the skirt was made of simple wool and now soaked up water like a sponge, hugging my legs and buttocks, and draining the warmth from me. The leather boots I wore at least provided some amount of protection from the water. Skirting a large puddle of water in the middle of the muddy road, I scanned my surroundings, looking for some shelter to escape the torrential downpour. Wilderness surrounded me as far I could see. Not that I could see far, with the storm clouds blocking out the setting sun, and covering the cold windy evening in a blanket of darkness. Nothing looked like it would provide much of any shelter. Of course, the trees presented a dubious covering from the rain, but crouching in the forest waiting for the rain to end didn&#8217;t sound particularly appealing to me. I shifted my grip on the shaft of my spear as I tried to cover my exposed cleavage with my drenched bearskin cape. Unfortunately, the biting wind kept blowing the bottom of my cape up, ruining my efforts to keep any part of myself dry. Soon I would either have to stop and try to light a fire, or I&#8217;d find myself sneezing uncontrollably for the next couple of days with an uncomfortable cold. 

Chapter 1
I found myself trudging down the dirt road as I felt my toes go numb with the cold. Just as I became sure that I had no choice but to turn aside and make camp, I noticed a light up ahead. A square yellowish light. A house! I approached the house cautiously. After all, a house in the middle of an often unused road didn&#8217;t seem to be exactly safe. On closer inspection, I noticed that it was actually a cabin, probably a one room cabin from the small size. A small lean-to covered a cart and a mule to the side of the cabin. Judging from the logs of wood piled on the cart and the proximity to the forests that lined the road, I guessed that inhabitant of the cabin must be a forester. He probably cut trees from the forest and carted them down the road to the nearest city. That also meant I was finally approaching my current destination, the city of Betancuria. I could hear the sounds of talking inside the cabin. A low deep voice of a man, and the slightly higher pitched voice of a child, probably a boy. I quickly approached the cabin and knocked on the door, impatiently hoping they&#8217;d let me in for the night to escape the rain.
�Excuse me?� I shouted to be heard above the storm and whistling wind as I knocked on the door. The voices inside the cabin fell silently immediately. After a long moment of silence from within the cabin, I heard the thumping of feet approaching the door.
�Yeh! Whatcha want?� the man asked from within the cabin.
I continued knocking. �Just shelter for the evening good sir. I can pay for room and board.�
After another pause, the door opened part way and I found myself peering into a broad hairy chest in an open vest. Looking up, I saw a weather lined face scrutinizing me. He was dressed in a fur vest with matching loose fur pants. Muscular and tall, with blonde hair that fell haphazardly around his face, I could see the tension in his muscles as he watched me.&nbsp; A cautious man, a sign that the surrounding area wasn&#8217;t safe. I watched his gaze shift from my face to my exposed cleavage to my legs, then rise back to my breasts before they locked on my spear and widened in alarm. I knew what he saw; long black hair, smooth pale skin, lively brown eyes, delicate nose, small pouting mouth, and full curves covered in clothing that exposed a lot of skin. Of course, I was also drenched in water and suffering from spending days away from any form of civilization. So I suppose my long hair was plastered to my head, my pale skin was probably covered with dirt, and my facial features unnoticed in the gloom of the night.
�I travel alone, the spear warns away many bandits that would otherwise approach me.� I quickly explained to keep him from slamming the door in my face.
After a moment, he nodded and stepped aside, opening the door wide. �C&#8217;mon in then.&nbsp; I s&#8217;pose I have nothin to fear from a wee lass.�
�Thank you sir.� I flashed him a quick smile of relief as I entered the warm cabin and finally escaped the biting wind and rain.
Looking around, I saw that my estimation was quite right. The cabin was composed of one room. A bed rested in a corner. In the other corner, a fireplace held a blazing fire that warmed the room. A table stood next to the door in front of the window from which I had seen the cabin. In front of the fire, a boy of about fifteen sat staring at me, with a carving knife and a lump of wood that resembled both a horse and a frog. The boy had blond hair and blue eyes like his father, but his face was handsome, not yet lined with the cares that his father suffered.
�C&#8217;mon lass, have a seat by our fire. You&#8217;ll want food? I&#8217;m Ojak, and this be my boy Rolin.�
Gratefully, I crouched in front of the fire next to the boy.
�A pleasure to meet both of you Ojak. And you too Rolin. I&#8217;m Miriam.� I replied as I flashed a smile at Rolin. Rolin&#8217;s mouth opened, but he seemed too shy to speak.
�What monster are you carving?� I asked, pointing to the horse-frog in Rolin&#8217;s hands.
�It&#8217;s not a monster. It&#8217;s a dog!� Rolin exclaimed. 
His indignation had apparently overcome his shyness. Ojak gave me a friendly smile as he closed the door, locking the wooden bar inside the door before he moved to sit next to me in front of the fire.
�Miriam yeh? That&#8217;s a name uncommon in these parts. But what brings you alone down this way?�
Placing my spear on the floor next to me, I rubbed my hands in front of the fire. �I&#8217;m looking for a man, he&#8217;s headed toward Betancuria. Fat, little taller than me, dark hair, and probably dressed in rich robes.�
�Family?� Ojak asked.
�No. He&#8217;s a thief. Stole an heirloom. I&#8217;m trying to retrieve the heirloom.� I explained. 
�How much do I owe for room and board?� I asked abruptly as I pulled off my drenched bear skin cloak and stretched it out closer to the fire. 
I&#8217;d have to take off my clothes to completely dry myself and my cloak would provide at least some covering while I waited.
�Jus your company lass.� I looked back and saw Ojak&#8217;s eyes leering hungrily at my cleavage. 
It had been months since I had last been laid. In fact, I hadn&#8217;t had any sex since I last left the temple on my mission to return the heirloom. Plus, I considered, I was low on coin, and I would probably need them once I reached Betancuria� I felt my nipples harden against the leather of my corset, and I was sure my pussy was wet from more than just the drenching I got in the rain. Still, despite how horny I was, I wasn&#8217;t a whore. Plus, Ojak didn&#8217;t look clean or remotely attractive.
�My wife died a coupla years ago yeh? I don got enough coin for whores in the city� an we don&#8217;t go in the city much.� Ojak continued to explain as I considered his proposition.
�I understand. My payment will be in coin though.� I replied.
�Eh. A copper for meal and a copper for roof then.� Ojak grunted, clearly disappointed.
I paid and they served me some of their dinner. A stew composed of rabbit meat, cabbage, and potatoes. 
I sipped the stew from a simple bowl they had provided. �This is really good.�
�I made it myself. Snared the rabbit and traded one of my carvings for cabbage and potatoes.� Rolin proudly explained.
 He did cook well. I had to give him that. But from how his dog carving looked, I guessed the trade had been more charity than a true transaction.
We passed the night as I told them some about my travels and they told me about Betancuria. Both of them watched me closely as I pulled off my clothes when the bear skin finally dried. Despite my determination not to sleep with Ojak, my erect nipples and dripping pussy betrayed my arousal as they watched me strip before I pulled the bearskin around myself.
Rolin continued to stare after I had wrapped myself as best I could with my cloak. �There are bandits right at the edges of Betancura.�
�Bandits? How many?� I asked.
�Jus a band Miriam. Mebbe five or ten. Jus pay the fare an they&#8217;ll let you pass.� Ojak clarified.
Much later, the conversation died down and my companions went to bed. Ojak and Rolin shared the tiny bed, while I slept on the floor, wrapped in my bear skin cloak despite Ojak&#8217;s attempts to coax me into sharing the bed with him.

I woke with the distinct feeling I was being watched. Opening my eyes slightly, I saw that the fire had died down and barely lit the room. Ojak stood above me, looking down at me. I was about to roll over and let Ojak know I was awake when I noticed large coils of rope in his hands. Rope he probably used to tie down the wood he carted to the city. Rolin lay asleep on the bed still. Considering the rope Ojak was holding, it was obvious he intended to tie me up, and probably ravish me afterwards. I immediately felt my nipples harden at the thought. The idea of finding myself at Ojak&#8217;s mercy while he had sex with me was extremely arousing. Plus, there was no way he&#8217;d want to keep me tied up after sleeping with me. I&#8217;d be another mouth to feed, one that he&#8217;d have to keep careful watch of. So instead, I feigned sleep and waited. After a long moment, I felt Ojak&#8217;s grab my bear skin cloak and pull it away from me, exposing my body to his view. Ojak quickly but gently began to tie me up, probably thinking me to be still asleep. I was rolled on my stomach, my hands tied together behind me. My feet were similarly bound with expert knots.
�Wakey lass.� Ojak demanded as he rolled me on my back and began fondling my breasts.
I pretended to wake and feigned surprise at finding myself bound. �What-?�
Ojak cut my question off by stuffing a dirty cloth in my mouth and binding it into place. �Yeh listen to me lass. Yeh shoulda accepted the offer. S&#8217;now Ima take wot I wanted.�
 With those words, he proceeded to pick me up and carry me to the table under the window. He roughly positioned me and rebound each of my legs to an opposite leg on the table. This left me bent over facing the window, my breasts pressing into the wooden table, erect nipples making me extremely uncomfortable, legs spread wide, with my lower lips presented to everyone in the cabin. He then proceeded to tie my hands to tool hooks that stood above the window. I found myself now standing slightly bend over, hands tied high above my hand but no longer resting my torso on the table. Despite the acrid odor from the cloth stuffed in my mouth, I could still faintly smell the scent of my own arousal�
�Yeh&#8217;re wet!� Ojak exclaimed in surprise as his fingers prodded my sex and came away drenched.
I groaned through the gag. I had never found myself so turned on before. I was dripping and he hadn&#8217;t even really begun to fondle me. Must be too long since I last got laid, I reasoned to myself. Without any preliminaries, Ojak quickly pulled off his breaches and slid his erect member into my well lubricated pussy. Reaching my breasts, he began to roughly pinch my erect nipples. Despite his inept handling, I felt myself growing inexplicably more aroused. He continued to pound away and began slapping my rear end in time with his thrusts. Somehow the painful treatment increased the incredible sensations and I found myself groaning into the dirty cloth and trying to move my ass in time with his thrusts.
�Yeh lass! Been so long�� he grunted and then stiffened as he ejaculated into me.
I groaned in frustration. Was that it? A two minute lay? I still hadn&#8217;t orgasmed! Still, I couldn&#8217;t deny that something about my situation really turned me on.
Rolin spoke up in the silence as Ojak lay panting on top of me, his cock still penetrating me, though softening and beginning to slide out.
�Uhm� What&#8217;s going on dad?�
Ojak pulled himself out of me as he stood up and gave my ass a hard slap. I yelped into my gag and wiggled my ass, causing a drop of his spunk to run down my thigh.
�Yeh lass a thief son. I see her take spear an try an run off wit our coin.� Ojak lied as he rubbed my ass.
I made a noise of protest into the gag that quickly turned to a yelp as Ojak smacked my ass again. �Shut it lass!�
I could hear Rolin getting off the bed and approaching us. �What&#8217;re you going to do with her dad?�
I felt humiliated and incredibly horny as they talked about me like I wasn&#8217;t there. Looking over my shoulder, I saw Rolin looking intently at my dripping pussy.
�We c&#8217;n sell her in da city. We c&#8217;n sell her for a lot.� Ojak announced.
Shock penetrated my mind. They had slaves in Betancuria? And Ojak had never planned to untie me! I felt instant regret that I had given in to my lust and let Ojak bind me. Strangely I also felt extreme arousal at the thought of being presented in front of strangers and sold like cattle. In fact, I almost came right there with only the stimulation of Ojak running his hands over my ass.
Ojak slapped my ass one more time and began dressing. �G&#8217;on my boy. Yeh have some fun wit this cunt! Ima go wakey ol Joe fo a slave collar an a brandin iron.�
With that, he fondled my breasts and walked out the door. �I be back after lunch wit the tools son. Bank up tha fire for tha branding before lunch.�
After the door closed I felt Rolin reach out and tentatively run his hands over my ass and legs. �You aren&#8217;t really a thief are you?�
I shook my head no and pleaded with my eyes for him to remove the gag.
Rolin sighed regretfully as he continued to run his hands over my body. �I know. I was just pretending to sleep. I saw dad tie you up while you were sleeping.�
Sliding his hands up my back to my head, Rolin untied the gag and pulled the dirty cloth from my mouth. �Guess I can&#8217;t let dad sell you. He&#8217;s always hated living in this cabin and wanted the money to move into the city. Sorry that I didn&#8217;t help you earlier, but my dad� he, well, he hits hard.�
�Thank you so much! I truly thought I was going to be sold.� I gasped gratefully after Rolin removed the gag.
Rolin bent down and began untying my legs. �You&#8217;re welcome. Though I&#8217;ll probably always regret ��
I looked over my shoulder at Rolin. He was kneeling at my feet fumbling with the ropes. �Your dad won&#8217;t be back until lunch right?�
Rolin looked up from trying to untie one of my feet. �Yeah?�
I winked at him and licked my lips seductively. �I&#8217;m still tied up, and completely at your mercy��
Rolins gaze turned predatory. �Ah. No regrets?�
�Mmm. No regrets indeed.� I murmured as Rolin&#8217;s fingers began to play with me.

A couple hours later, I was finally free, both of us were sated, and had managed to get fairly clean. I bent down and began pulling my clothes on while Rolin watched with a dreamy expression on his face. Sliding my skirt on, I swayed my hips and watched his penis jump slightly. I laughed at the expression of mock exhaustion on his face.
�You&#8217;re young. I know you aren&#8217;t that tired.�
�I&#8217;m not that young! I turned fourteen last week! And I bet you&#8217;re not more than a year or two older.�
�I&#8217;m twenty Rolin. But I&#8217;m sorry, I didn&#8217;t mean anything except that you have a lot more� stamina.� I grinned at him and bending down, gave the head of his penis a gentle kiss.
�Holy-!� he groaned as it jumped to attention.
�Sorry, if I don&#8217;t want to risk running into Ojak, I&#8217;ll have to leave soon. So we&#8217;ll have to make this quick.� I murmured before taking his cock into my mouth.
Swirling my tongue around the underside of this cock, one of my hands played with his balls while the other rhythmically squeezed the base of his cock. After a couple minutes of stimulation, he came and spurted large amounts of cum into my mouth. Swallowing most of his cum, I proceeded to scoop up the remainder that had dripped onto my breasts and lick it up. The expression of speechless amazement on his face was priceless. I gave him a wicked grin and began to clean his prick with my tongue.

Minutes later, I walked out of the cabin into the late morning air. The rain had cleared and though the road was still muddy, the sun was shining and brought comfortable warmth. Spear in hand, I was dressed once more in my armor plated corset, wool skirt, leather boots, and bear skin cloak. I was comfortably dry, sexually satisfied (no thanks to Ojak), had learned that I enjoyed kinky sex with ropes (a lot), and knew that I needed to watch out for bandits outside Betancuria.

Chapter 2
As I walked a few steps down the road, I heard the cabin door open again and saw Rolin stepping out. He had a knap sack on his back and carried a sturdy hunting bow along with a quiver of arrows. I turned around and waited for him. His eyes lit up happily when he saw me waiting for him.
I watched him walk toward me. I noticed he was about my height, a little taller. �You&#8217;re leaving?� I asked.
�Yeah. My dad� well he won&#8217;t be happy when he finds out I ruined his chance of moving into the city. He&#8217;s threatened to kick me out several times already, so��
I turned and began walking, gesturing to Rolin to walk with me. �Where will you go?�
�Uhm... I was actually wondering if I could travel with you?� he said, a note of insecurity entering his voice. �It&#8217;s no big deal. If you don&#8217;t want to I mean. I have somewhere else I could go to.� He added hurriedly.
I could tell his last statement was a lie. He had probably lived most of his life in the cabin and knew little of the world other then foresting. In addition, I was the reason he had to leave the cabin and his current life. Plus, he was good in bed after he overcame his initial inexperience. I had reached orgasm countless times during the hours he had ravaged me. Much better staying power compared to his father�
I flashed him a bright smile. �You can stay with me until we reach the city.�
He grinned happily. �I&#8217;ll help you out. I can shoot pretty well. I won&#8217;t get in your way. You&#8217;ll see.�
I reached out and held his hand to reassure him. �I know you won&#8217;t. I&#8217;d take you along just for your culinary skills anyways. Do you know which way Ojak went to meet that old Joe fellow?�
Rolin pointed into the trees. �Father probably cut through the trees to get there. Otherwise, it would have taken a full day and he wouldn&#8217;t have said he&#8217;d be back by afternoon.�
�Good. Do you think you could shoot something for our lunch today?�
Rolin straightened his back and began to pay attention to his surroundings. �I&#8217;ll try. It really depends on whether anything runs our way.�
I could tell by the slight upturning of his lip and his erect posture that he liked feeling needed. That he wanted me to depend on him.
We traveled down the muddy road till evening. Rolin had managed to shoot a rabbit which we shared over a small fire when we stopped for lunch. I had managed to spear a crippled buck which Rolin now carried over his shoulders. The trees had begun to thin around us when Rolin pointed out a good spot to make camp.
Rolin pointed out a narrow dirt track. �That path leads to a stream. We should camp near the water.�
�Won&#8217;t the water attract animals? Or other people?� I asked as I followed Rolin down the path.
Rolin gave me a reassuring smile. �There aren&#8217;t any dangerous animals in this region and the bandits don&#8217;t like to wander this far into the wilderness. Not enough people to rob on these roads. Only the locals really know of this area anyways.�
I looked around as we reached a clearing next to a stream of water. �Your father? Ojak? Would he know of this area?�
�Yeah. But we&#8217;ve been walking almost all day, and we have a good head start. I don&#8217;t really think he&#8217;d chase after us anyways. He took you when you were asleep before. But you&#8217;re awake now, and you look like you know how to use that spear.�
I nodded as I bent over to pick up a piece of wood. �True. Do you have any experience with other weapons other then the bow?�
�Other than how to swing an axe to chop down trees. No. I did always want a sword.�
I grinned at Rolin mischievously as I noticed him eyeing the top of my breasts. �You have a sword. A large and tasty one.� 
I grinned as his sword began to jump to attention. �Now stop ogling me and help me gather wood for our fire.�
Soon, we had a large fire going despite the warmth of the evening. The buck meat was cooking on an improvised wooden frame that Rolin had taught me how to construct. While Rolin cooked, I went to the stream and began to fill our water skins. As I knelt down to fill them, my eyes were drawn to a broken leather strap. It looked to have been there for some time, as it was partially covered with dirt. Pulling out the strap I saw that it was long, about five feet with a two inch width. Shiny silver rivets studded the entire leather strap with a circular silver buckle attached to the end of one side of the strap. The other side of the strap looked torn, no doubt the reason the strap had been discarded. The designs on the buckle were those often used by rich nobility from my birth city. I quickly filled the rest of the bottles and brought the leather strap to Rolin.
I knelt next to him as I placed the water skins behind us. �Do you recognize the designs on these buckle? Have you ever noticed them anywhere?�
He reached out and took the leather strap to inspect them. �Nope. They look exotic. Why?�
�Those designs look similar to the ones used in my city by nobles. It&#8217;s likely that one of the servants or soldiers of the man I&#8217;m chasing discarded this strap here when it broke. That means they were probably camping here.�
Rolin nodded and handed the leather strap back to me. �How long has it been here?�
�I don&#8217;t know. But I&#8217;d estimate, maybe a few weeks?�
�What&#8217;s it used for anyways?� he asked as he went back to tending his cooking.
�It&#8217;s part of a leather harness used to tie a team of horses together to a wagon.�
�So this man you&#8217;re after, he&#8217;s a noble?�
I ran my hand through my hair, trying to straighten the tangled curls. �Yes. Or at least, he used to be. He&#8217;s undoubtedly carrying lots of wealth with him though.�
Rolin gave me a wicked grin. �If he went to Betancuria using this road with a filled wagon, you can be sure the bandits outside Betancuria stopped him. And probably robbed him too.�
Dinner proved to be better today then what Rolin had cooked last night. We sat on the ground facing each other across the fire. Rolin had moved the wooden frame that he used to cook the meat. The frame was made of wooden pools tied together. There was basically, one long piece of wood with two legs attached to each end at angles. The long piece of wood could be rotated, so after sticking it through the meat, you could rotate the frame to let it cook. Quite a clever idea.
I moaned happily as I took another bite into the soft rich meat. �This is great Rolin!�
�Thanks.� He smiled happily as he too ate.
After we had mostly finished eating, I asked, �Forgive me if my question is inappropriate. Buy why do you speak so differently from your father?�
�I learned to speak mostly from my mother. She was a born in Betancuria. My dad though, he&#8217;s from far up North. He never told me exactly where.�
I nodded. �Why did your mother leave Betancuria?�
There was a moment silence. When I looked at Rolin, his face was red with either anger or embarrassment. �She was kicked out.�
�Oh.� Probing into this topic was probably a bad idea. Everyone had their secrets and this seemed to be a sore one for Rolin.
After another moment of silence, Rolin asked me, �How about you? Where are you from?�
�I&#8217;m from far to the East. A city called Floren.�
�What&#8217;s it like there?� Genuine curiosity showed in his eyes, reminding me how young he was.
�It&#8217;s beautiful. It&#8217;s a large city, soaring towers that reach far into the sky with sky bridges connecting each of those towers. All of them surround the temple, the largest building inside Floren. The temple itself is shaped like a coliseum, but rises almost as high as the eye can see.�
Rolin&#8217;s eyes widened in awe. �How did they build that?�
�The first Priest King of Floren built it using many magical artifacts. The man I&#8217;m chasing stole one of them.�
�Oh. Wow. Why did they send you? And why alone? I mean, if such an important thing got stolen, and I was king, I&#8217;d send out an army to get it back.�
I grinned at him and began to pack away the rest of the cooked buck meat for tommorow. �Floren is constantly at war with her neighbors, so the Priest King couldn&#8217;t send an army. Instead he sent a band of thirty of his bodyguards with five priestesses.�
�Oh. Why the priestesses?� Rolin asked as he helped me clean up.
�The main reason is because we can sense when we&#8217;re near the artifact.�
He �You&#8217;re one of those priestesses?�
I nodded. �Yes.�
�What was the other reason he sent the priestesses?�
�We healed them if they got wounded.� I said as I felt my face heat up.
�Oh. What happened to them?�
�They died in a battle.� I replied shortly, hoping that he&#8217;d drop the topic.
He didn&#8217;t. �Why didn&#8217;t you heal them?� 
�My magic is powered through sex. And we didn&#8217;t really have time during the battle.�
He grinned. �Through sex? Really?�
My face burned red in embarrassment. �Yes. That was one of the &#8216;gifts&#8217; the Priest King bestowed on us before sending us on the quest.�
I stood and walked toward the stream, indicating the conversation was over. �I&#8217;m going to take a dip and clean myself before I sleep.�
Rolin followed me. �So what did having sex with you do for me?�
I glanced back as I began to removed my cloak. �Nothing. You weren&#8217;t wounded.�
�Oh. Well I&#8217;ve a blister on my foot that you can cure.� He confidently reached out to caress the bare skin of my back and began untying my corset with his othser hand.
I felt my body respond to his touch and I leaned back against him as he pulled my corset off. Reaching behind me, I tugged his shirt up to slip my hand under his breeches and moaned as his hands cupped my full breasts.
�You&#8217;re the most beautiful girl I&#8217;ve ever seen.� Rolin whispered in my ear as one of his hands pinched my nipples and the other pulled my skirt down.
I tilted my head back and kissed him as I stepped out of my skirt and my hands found his erect member. I began to stroke him while one of his hands tugged insistently on my erect nipple and the other pushed lightly on my clit until he had me bent over on my hands and knees, in the damp ground next to the stream. Moments after pulling his breeches down, Rolin guided his erect member into me. He went carefully, gently pushing into me while his hands held my waist. 
�You&#8217;re so tight!� he groaned as he finally sank himself in as far as he could.
�Harder!� I moaned as he began to pull himself out.
The quiet of the evening was soon filled with the rhythmic sounds of his cock thrusting into me and the groans of pleasure both of us made. 
My orgasm came first, washed through my body forcing out whimpers of pleasure from my moth and spasms in my pussy that drove Rolin over the edge. He stiffened, then thrust deeply into me and ejaculated. Then Rolins weight collapsed on me, pushing me to the ground with his softening cock still pushed firmly in my pussy.
�You&#8217;re heavy.� I gasped breathlessly as I squirmed under his weight.
He rolled us onto our sides while wrapping his arms and legs around me, his penis though soft, was still buried in me. �Sorry Miriam. Did I hurt you?� He mumbled quietly.
I ran my hand over the muscles in his arm. �Don&#8217;t worry about it.�
After we had both stopped panting, I extricated myself from Rolin. I left him lying on the ground and entered the stream to wash myself. Dipping my foot in the water, I found it to be pleasantly cool after my exertions. Already completely nude, I plunged into the water, and began to wash myself, paying particular attention to my nether regions. As I began to wash my hair, I noticed Rolin hadn&#8217;t moved from the bank. Instead, he lay on his stomach watching me bathe.
Turning to him, I asked, �What&#8217;s wrong?�
His looked away, blushing so much it was visible even in the evening light. �Nothing.�
�Are you sure?� I asked as I got out of the water and used my cloak to cover myself.
�I liked it better yesterday.� Rolin blurted out and quickly scrambled to his feet pulling his breeches back on.
I looked at him closely, his face was still looking away in embarrassment. �You mean the sex?�
�Uh huh.� He nodded.
He didn&#8217;t seem to want to clarify himself. I hazarded a guess. �Was it because I was tied up?�
�I think so.� All his confidence seemed to have disappeared with his confession.
I swayed up to him and watched his eyes focus on me. �Want to know a secret?� I asked.
�Uhm�� he responded incoherently as I pressed myself to him, resting my head on his chest.
�I wasn&#8217;t really asleep last night when Ojak tied me up.� I raised myself on tiptoes and whispered into his ear and then nibbled his ear lobe.
Rolin froze, then carefully asked, �Wh-� why did you let my dad tie you up?�
�I wanted to try it out.� I murmured into his ear while my hand slid down to feel his cock through his pants.
Rolin&#8217;s cock jumped in my hand. �Did you like it?� He asked breathlessly.
�I loved it.� I whispered and gave his penis a light squeeze.
He groaned in response and climaxed right into his pants.


Chapter 3
The unusual sounds of slurping and sucking filled the night. I was naked again, with the leather strap I had found by the stream around my neck like a collar. Rolin had reassembled the frame he used to cook the deer meat. I was now bent over the frame, with my legs spread wide, exposing my slit with Rolin&#8217;s cum and my own juices dripping down my thighs. My legs were tied to opposite ends of the frame using parts of my skirt which Rolin had considerably shortened to get material for ropes. He had asked for permission to mutilate my skirt of course. But I had been licking his feet while he collared me when he asked. I was far too horny and distracted by my own humiliation to think clearly. The slight chill in the night air soothed my buttocks, sore and red from being slapped and raised invitingly into the air. My hands were also bound using a strip from my skirt and were flat on the floor, holding me up. Otherwise, the weight from my upper body would have caused the frame to topple forward and throw me onto the ground. My breasts swung freely below me and my mouth was sucking on Rolins dick while he held the excess leather around my neck like a leash. We were both so occupied that neither of us noticed Ojak stepping into the clearing behind me.
�Son? Why� Wha&#8217;s goin on?� Ojak asked from behind me.
I tried to turn my head, but I was still impaled on Rolin&#8217;s cock and he still held the leather leash, keeping me from pulling back. That also effectively gagged me from making any noise other than a whimper of fear. The rush of fear sweeping through my body was accompanied by overwhelming arousal. Fear that I was going to be branded and sold. Arousal at being seen in this situation despite the similarity to what Ojak had done with me last night. I wriggled, trying to get free, but all I succeeded in doing was drawing their eyes to my red ass as it wriggled in the air.
Rolin&#8217;s considerable member filling my mouth and throat began to go limp. �Uh� I&#8217;m going to Betancuria with Miriam dad.�
�Why?� Ojak asked in a voice that sounded heartbroken and resigned.
�I couldn&#8217;t let you sell her dad. She didn&#8217;t do anything wrong.� Rolin answered.
�Yeh lass a warrior son. She gots a spear. We c&#8217;n either sell er or kill er. If the lass gets free she&#8217;ll kill us after wat we done to er.�
�No no. She likes this dad. She actually likes being tied up and stuff. We can&#8217;t sell her anyways. She&#8217;s mine now.� He accompanied his last phrase by patting me on the head like a dog.
Shame, lust, and indignation warred within me. Lust won out and rather than protesting his statement that I belonged to him, I found myself sucking his cock back to full length.
�Yeh lass asked you to tie er up?� Incredulity obvious in Ojak&#8217;s voice.
�Yeah! She obeys all my orders too. Like when I told her to crawl and lick my feet.� Rolin proudly announced. I felt my clit throb wildly as blood rushed to my face.
�She did? Why?�
�She gets off doing stuff like this dad�� Rolin last words were mixed with a groan as he then proceeded to ejaculate down my throat. �Clean my dick Miriam.� he ordered and I began to obediently lick his cock clean.
�God&#8217;s above.� Ojak muttered as he stepped up behind me and firmly gripped my red ass.
His hands kneading my sore buttocks forced a whimper from me. A small helpless sound filled with arousal.
�Stop dad. She&#8217;s mine. I&#8217;ll let you use her mouth, but her pussy is for me only. Anything but her mouth is off limits.� Rolin stated as he stepped away from my head.
Ojak moved in front of my face and shoved his erect penis into my mouth. �Well, guess you ain&#8217;t too young fo a bride son. S&#8217;pose I should be happy you willin to share.�
After sucking on Rolin&#8217;s large cock, the average sized cock in front of me didn&#8217;t provide any trouble. Where Rolin was both thick and long, Ojak was simply thick without the length to go farther than the back of my mouth. And so I began to lick Ojak&#8217;s dick as well�
I was left bound on the frame throughout the night, getting only short snatches of sleep. I was thankful that the night was still mostly warm and there were no little bugs biting my exposed skin. By the time the sun began to rise and light the sky, I had sucked off Ojak three times and taken Rolin in my pussy two more times when they awoke at random times in the night. My arms were numb from balancing on them all night and my back was sore from being arched backwards. Large amounts of dry cum and juices coated the inside of my thighs and my face. Ojak had stuffed what remained of my skirt into my mouth and tied it behind my head when he wasn&#8217;t using my mouth in the night, effectively preventing me from complaining. Even so, despite the treatment, or probably, because of the treatment, I was incredibly horny when Rolin finally woke up. I watched Rolin smile fondly at me as he approached me. He rubbed the top of my head and then surprised me by walking past, slapping my ass as he went by. I craned my head to see what he was doing and watched him piss into the dying fire pit. The stick of urine filled the air and burned my eyes. With my mouth gagged, I was forced to smell the urine with each breath I took. Walking back in front of me, Rolin untied my skirt from my mouth.
�Rolin, we have to ta-� I was cut off as Rolin shoved his half erect cock into my mouth.
�Clean me first. Then we can talk. After you suck me off.� Rolin ordered.
I was aroused despite my horror at my predicament, and with no choice, I proceeded to clean his dick, grimacing at the acrid taste of his piss. The sounds of my mouth slurping Rolin&#8217;s dick woke Ojak who watched with amusement.
�Imma take a dip in da water. Can&#8217;t wait to get tha wee mouth round my dick agin.� Ojak grinned as he walked toward the stream.
It didn&#8217;t take long for Rolin to reach the brink of orgasm. I briefly considered that I might be getting too much practice blowing people. Right before he climaxed, he pulled out and shot his load over my face. The humiliation of having a fourteen year old boy use me like this fueled my arousal to even greater heights. I could literally feel my juices running down my thigh. 
�Alright. What do you want to talk about Miriam?� he asked as he pulled his trousers back on.
�Could you untie me first? My arms are numb and my back hurts.�
He grinned at me wickedly and picked up my corset where we had left it the night before. �I know the kind of things you like now. Beg and I&#8217;ll think about it.�
Was I really that easy to read? After just two nights with me, he already knew how to bring my libido to full force by just using words that emphasized how helpless I was and how much control he had. With my hands bound on the floor, I could let the frame topple over, and then try to wiggle my feed forward. But- He interrupted my thoughts by casually flicking my erect nipple, pulling a moan of desire from my mouth.
�Well?� he asked as he stepped close in front of me, so that I had to tilt my head upwards to see him.
�Please untie me. I&#8217;ll do anything. Just please, let me go? Please Rolin?� I bent my arms as I begged, tilting my upper body until my stiff nipples touched the ground. I rubbed my head up and down his calf as I begged, feeling my wet pussy throb as I humiliated myself.
I heard Ojak laugh behind me. �Hafta see tha to believe tha. Guess you&#8217;re still busy wit your lass so Imma go use da bushes.�
Ojak then slapped my ass hard as he walked by, startling a yelp out of me, before he headed out of the clearing and into the forest.
�Alright dad.� Rolin replied.
 As Ojak stepped into the forest, Rolin saw the confused look on my face and explained. �That means he&#8217;s going to take a dump.�
�Oh. So� will you untie me please?� I pushed up with my arms when I asked this time and rubbed my nose against the crotch of his pants. His crotch smelled a bit ripe but then he did ejaculate in his pants last night�
�Hmm� I&#8217;ll let you go if you let me cut out parts of your shirt. Like I did with your skirt.� He grinned and picked up his skinning knife which he had used to cut up my skirt.
�That&#8217;s a corset. And it&#8217;s armor plated. I can&#8217;t let you just cut that up. It&#8217;s worth way more than the skirt.� I protested.
Rolin sauntered behind me and began to push his finger into my ass. �Oh? I can&#8217;t? In that case, I&#8217;m going to stick my fingers up here.�
I moaned in pain. I had never taken anything up my butt before. 
�Wait wait! Let&#8217;s talk about this! What part do you want to cut off?� I frantically begged as he forced a finger in and began pushing a second one.
Rolin laughed at me but pulled his finger out of my ass and walked back in front of me. He then waved the finger he had stuck into my ass in front of my face. 
�Clean it.� He ordered.
My face flushed with both embarrassment and arousal as I stretched my neck forward so I could suck on his dirty finger. Surprisingly, it didn&#8217;t taste like much. It was still incredibly humiliating.
As I sucked his finger, he explained his plans on how he was going to ruin my corset. �I&#8217;m going to cut the bottom part off. I came up with an idea last night while I was having sex with you and I want to try it out.�
I opened my mouth to protest, but his finger trapped my tongue and he asked, �Do you want me to untie you or not?�
Finally I nodded. I believed he was perfectly capable of leaving me stretched out for a couple more hours and my arms and back hurt. Seeing my nod, Rolin got to work untying me from the frame.
When I was finally free, I collapsed onto the ground in exhaustion. I was too tired to protest as I watched him cut up my corset.
�Is that all you wanted? To ask me to untie you?� Rolin asked me as he worked on cutting my corset apart.
I couldn&#8217;t stand looking at him ruin my corset so I turned my back as I replied. �Do you remember how you said I belonged to you last night?�
I heard a sharp snap as one of the armor plates was removed from the corset. �Yeah. I remember. You didn&#8217;t like it? If I remember right, you started sucking on my dick frantically when I told my dad that.�
I sighed. �I liked it. I can&#8217;t lie about that. I liked it too much. We have to separate our games and reality. Like now, you shouldn&#8217;t be cutting up my corset. I shouldn&#8217;t be letting you.�
�Too late for that. I already cut it off, I&#8217;m just removing the plates from the lower parts now.� He handed what was left of my corset to me.
Before Rolin mutilated it, my leather corset exposed all of my upper back, with laces to tighten the bottom part of my back. It flared out at the waist to follow the curve of my hips. So when I wore my corset and skirt, none of my mid riff was exposed. The top of the corset ended just above covering my nipples. Rolin pretty much transformed my corset into an uplift bikini by cutting off the lower portion. And since the corset was open in the upper back, in order to wear it now, I&#8217;d have to punch holes in the side, and thread the lace through, making a couple strings of lace the only covering on my bare back.
�And what do you mean by games?� Rolin asked.
My eyes widened in surprise as I realized Rolin really thought I would obey all his decisions, not just the sex related ones. He acted so confidently that I often forgot he was only fourteen.
Out loud I asked, �What are you going to do with me?�
�Well, earlier when I realized you really got off on being my slave, I figured we&#8217;d head to Betancuria where I&#8217;d learn a trade and officially register you as my slave. But since my dad seems okay with it, we&#8217;re going to go back to the cabin. Maybe when I&#8217;m a little older, I can build a cabin of our own. Don&#8217;t worry though, the next time we make a trip to Betancuria with our wood, I&#8217;ll make sure I officially register you as mine.�
�That&#8217;s the problem Rolin. I like you. I like pretending to be your slave. A sex slave. But I don&#8217;t want to be a real slave.�
�I don&#8217;t get it. You said you liked it when I tied you up and took control.�
I rolled over and looked at Rolin. His face showed his uncertainty as if all the confidence he had gained dominating me had been drained away.
�I didn&#8217;t realize until your dad first tied me up, but I like to give up control temporarily. For a short amount of time, I like it when you make all the decisions for me. But I can&#8217;t have you making all my decisions.�
I saw the confused look on his face and wondered how to explain it to him. I was starting to realize that in many ways, Rolin really was too young for me to get romantically involved with. I gave up. He wouldn&#8217;t understand anyways. Instead I gave my second reason.
�I&#8217;m on a quest to return the artifact stolen from Floren. I can&#8217;t be your permanent slave Rolin. My mission comes first.�
�Forget your mission! You&#8217;re going to do anything I told you to. You said so last night.� Rolin grabbed my leash and pulled me towards him.
My arms were still numb and my leg muscles were sore from being stretched all night, but I managed to crawl over to him instead of being dragged. It surprised me that he was acting so immature. I briefly considered asking him to stop, but decided not to. Judging from my reaction to begging earlier, begging him to stop pulling me would only make me hornier then crawling to him would.
�See! You&#8217;re crawling to me! You like it!� he crowed when I finally reached his feet and collapsed.
I gave up. I was too tired to explain that whether I liked it or not made no difference. I couldn&#8217;t walk and I didn&#8217;t want to be dragged. He probably wouldn&#8217;t have understood anyways. He simply didn&#8217;t want to understand. My spear was next to the fire on the other side of the clearing, and I didn&#8217;t have the heart to kill him anyways. Not after I enjoyed sleeping with him so much. Rolin apparently thought everything was fine, that I had surrendered. He released my leash and I promptly fell asleep.










Chapter 4
I woke up to the sensation of something big and hard filling my pussy. I moaned and squinted at the sky. The sun high in the sky told me it was late afternoon. I could see that I was still in the clearing. Rolin crouched between my legs, grinning down at me while pushing his erect cock into me. Ojak crouched at my head, his penis out and already erect, obviously expecting me to give him a blow job.
I squirmed as the pleasurable sensations from my pussy filled me. �It&#8217;s late Rolin� we should have been on the road to Betancuria hours ago��
They both ignored me. Rolin grabbed my hips and lifted my body up, while Ojak reached out, grabbed my leash and pulled my head backwards. I found myself looking at Ojak&#8217;s cock upside down as he pushed it into my mouth. The angle seemed to provide him better penetration, and I found his thick cock actually entering my throat with each thrust as he fucked my mouth. My feeble whimpers of protests soon disappeared as I rocked to the overwhelming sensations of penetration from my mouth and pussy simultaneously. Apparently, Ojak had gained a large amount of staying power after being sucked on repeatedly last night. My orgasm was filled with waves of pleasure that rolled over me continuously as they pounded into me in tandem. Ojak lasted almost as long as Rolin. Rather than ejaculate in me though, they pulled out and shot their load over my body. Ojak&#8217;s thick white cream dripped down my breasts while Rolin&#8217;s decorated my stomach. Rolin then gently lowered me back to the ground. Both Ojak and Rolin lay on the floor recovering. I slowly rolled myself on my hands and knees, muscles still sore from stretching them all night. I tried to get up, but couldn&#8217;t quite get my thighs to hold my weight, so I crawled toward the stream to wash myself. I could smell myself. I was covered in cum and smelled like it.
The sun in the sky said it was still late afternoon. I had finished washing myself in the stream, and had pulled my long black hair into a pony tail. I figured if I was going to keep giving blow jobs, it would be best if my hair was out of the way. I had also dressed myself in what remained of my clothing. My dark brown skirt now barely covered me in front. It was even shorter in the back. Apparently, Rolin couldn&#8217;t cut straight. The back of the skirt was about 4 inches long. It covered the top half of my buttocks and left the rest clearly visible. Anyone looking at me from behind would be able to see my pussy when I walked or spread my legs. I had been forced to punch holes into the sides and top of my corset to lace it together. My corset was now composed of two separate leather pieces that fully covered the bottom of my breasts, and rose to cover my nipples. Lace attached the two pieces of leather together in front, and behind. Two strings of lace also had to be tied from the top of the corset to my collar, to hold up the corset. At least the small interlinking pieces of armor plating were still intact. I had also found out what Rolin had done with the rest of my corset. He had made six cuffs which I now wore, along with a riding crop. The cuffs had strings of leather hanging from them to be wrapped around the armor plating he had left intact around the cuffs. The two cuffs around my wrists were like bracers and were a good three inches thick. The two at my ankles were thin and a little loose. They looked like bracelets. The last cuffs were one inch thick and were snapped around my thighs. They had taken my bear skin cloak to hold the deer meat and so I stood on the road with my skin almost completely exposed. At least they hadn&#8217;t altered my comfortable boots. Rolin was holding my leash and smacking my buttocks with his riding crop. The cuffs on my wrists were locked together in front of me, leaving my rear end defenseless. Ojak held my spear and watched me with a large grin on his face.
�I&#8217;m sorry Rolin but I really can&#8217;t go back with you.� I panted when Rolin finally stopped with the riding crop.
Rolin stuck a finger into my pussy, coming away with his finger coated with my juices. �Look at how wet you are! You can&#8217;t say you don&#8217;t want this.�
He made me suck his finger clean. While his other hand rubbed my burning rump.
�I do want you, and what you do to me, you know that.� My last words ended in a moan as I arched my ass back into his soothing hands.
He moved to unlock my wrists cuffs. �Then why do you want to leave me to go to Betancuria?� 
�If I wanted to leave you, would I still be wearing your collar and your cuffs?� I asked as Rolin pulled my wrists behind me and locked them together again.
�You&#8217;re wearing my collar and cuffs, you like it when I whip you and give you orders. So you like being my slave. But you want to go to Betancuria when I tell you not to?� Rolin asked as he pulled my bound wrists upwards, forcing me to bend over.
Ojak started laughing. �Son, yeh aint tamed this lass. She wants to be yeh slave. But only at night. Miriam still wants to decide stuff in da day. Am I right lass?�
I looked in shock at Ojak. He was the last person I expected to understand. �Yes. You&#8217;re correct. Mostly.�
Rolin pulled out his erect cock, and started rubbing it up and down my slit. �So you want to be my slave at night only?�
I moaned as his tip of his cock became slick with my juices and bumped my clitoris. �I want you in charge while we have sex.�
Then both of us stopped talking as Rolin suddenly thrust himself into me.
It was now early evening and we had reached an agreement. Rolin had just finished thoroughly fucking me while I sucked on Ojak for the last time. Droplets of Rolin&#8217;s cum dripped down my inner thighs, visible to everyone thanks to my shortened skirt. I reached down, scooped it up and licked it off my hand. My wrists weren&#8217;t buckled together anymore, but I still wore the cuffs.
�I thot you got free and kidnapped my son. Tha&#8217;s why I was following yous. Tha idea went inna fire when I saw yous all trussed up las night.� Ojak explained as he parted farewell and left to return back to his cabin.
Our agreement was that when Rolin wanted sex, I would be his slave, he my master. Otherwise, he would be my companion, and travel with me to Betancuria. When we reached Betancuria, we would then decide how we wanted to continue our arrangement. I should have asked for him to obey me at all other times to make it fair, but we had come to the agreement while he was fucking me so I was relieved that I had managed to set any limits at all.
We traveled the rest of the day during which Rolin alternated between fondling my exposed ass and probing my nether lips as we walked. He had my leash clipped to his belt and kept me aroused, but never let me reach orgasm. My cloak with the deer meat was expertly tied to his back like a back pack. He also proved his knowledge of local plants by finding greens to supplement our meal. A delicious meal I ate naked with only my cuffs and collars, kneeling next to him on my bear skin cloak. He had placed my food on the cloak and locked my hands together behind me forcing me to eat with my mouth alone. The entire time I ate, he kept a finger prodding at my dripping slit. After the meal, my wrist cuffs were tied to my angle cuffs, and my thigh cuffs were locked together. Rolin then sat in front of me and had me give him a blow job. He fell asleep after ordering me to keep his cock in my mouth, but not to suck. Sometime during the night, I fell asleep, and released his cock.
I awoke to sharp painful slaps on my ass. Rolin thoroughly whipped my buttocks for not holding his penis in my mouth all night. He then proceeded to expertly fuck me, finally allowing me to orgasm. And what an orgasm it was.
We were on the road to Betancuria again. It was late in the afternoon, and I had begun to hear noises that weren&#8217;t natural to the forest. Nor were they the sounds of Rolin&#8217;s fingers fucking my dripping slit. My leash was clipped to his belt again and he walked next to me with one hand behind me playing with my ass or my pussy.
I stopped and grabbed his arm. �Wait. Do you hear that?�
Rolin halted next to me and tilted his head. �Oh you&#8217;re right. That sounds like a lot of wagons on paved road. Means the main road is right ahead of us with a caravan.�
�Oh.� I reached over to pull the leash from his belt.
Rolin grabbed my wrist while his other finger began fucking me again. �What&#8217;re you doing?�
I started panting and threw my head back as I neared orgasm again. But Rolin immediately slowed his fingers, denying me release.
I tried to press myself onto his fingers for more stimulation, but he merely moved his hand with me. �I don&#8217;t want to be seen like this.�
�So? I&#8217;m your master when it comes to sex right? And we&#8217;re having sex right now. So we&#8217;re going to travel like this. Everyone&#8217;s going to know you belong to me.� Rolin replied and began to move his fingers in earnest.
His words along with the extra stimulation of his fingers drove me over the edge and I climaxed. A screaming, shaking orgasm that ended with me slumped on his shoulder, held up by his fingers buried in my pussy.
He grinned wickedly. �They&#8217;re going to think someone is dying out here.�
Minutes later, when no one had approached I asked Rolin, �How come no one came to explore if they heard me?�
His hand moved up to my bare lower back and then traced the laces on my upper back. �They don&#8217;t want to get involved with strangers. They&#8217;re merchants, and they pay the bandits to get through, but that doesn&#8217;t mean there aren&#8217;t other bandits trying to lure them away. They learn to ignore anything that isn&#8217;t their business.�
I shivered under his caresses. �So you could do whatever you wanted to me in their sight, and they wouldn&#8217;t harm either of us?�
�Well some of them do hire mercenaries. And those mercenaries aren&#8217;t as predictable.�
When I had recovered, we walked out of the dirt road and joined the caravans on the paved road.
I received lots of attention and speculation from people in the passing wagons. Even though none of them approached us or spoke to us directly, I heard many people talking about us. Most common were whispered comments arguing whether I was a whore or a slave. I also heard many of them mention the red crop marks on my exposed ass. One of the men passing by pointed out that the crop swinging merrily from Rolin&#8217;s belt was a loud testimony as to who had marked me. Rolin rubbed his hand possessively over one of my ass cheeks the entire time. That sparked a debate over Rolin&#8217;s age.
 Even though his fingers weren&#8217;t buried in my pussy and he wasn&#8217;t attempting to arouse me, I found my needy slit dripping juices that ran down my thigh. All the people watching Rolin fondle my buttocks had me on the edge of an orgasm. The spear I held in my hand was the only thing that prevented most of them from approaching or speaking too loudly about us. By the time evening had arrived, the caravan had passed us, and we were alone on the wide road. Rolin&#8217;s hands went back to my pussy lips and found me sopping wet.
�Damn you&#8217;re wet.� He whispered as one of his fingers found my clit and began to play with it.
I couldn&#8217;t hold back a loud moan filled with desire.
Rolin&#8217;s hand clamped over my mouth immediately and he hissed in my ear. �Shhh! We&#8217;re getting near the bridge where the bandits normally collect fare. I&#8217;m not sure exactly where they camp so you have to stay quiet.�
I nodded that I understood, and he removed his hands from both my lower and upper lips. I began to watch the night as we walked down the paved road as silently as we could. The moonlight was partially obscured by the cloudy night, but still provided enough lighting to see.
�Why can&#8217;t we just pay the fare like the other merchants?� I whispered to Rholin.
�They might decide they want you as well as the fare.�
�Do they kidnap women often?�
Rolin combed his fingers through my hair. �Sometimes. But most young women who travel this road go heavily escorted. Your spear might make them hesitate, but they&#8217;ll still see you as a beautiful slave and they&#8217;ll probably rape you at the very least.�
Just as the bridge came into view, I noticed a glint of metal in the trees. I immediately reached out with my arm and stopped Rolin. With one finger over my lips, I made the universal gesture for silence, then pointed to the tree where I could now see a man sitting in the branches, with a cross bow resting on his lap. Thankfully, he was looking on the other side of the bridge, probably expecting to rob people leaving Betancuria. Otherwise he would have spotted us walking in the middle of the road right away. I quickly led Rolin into the trees on the opposite side of the forest. I reached out to pull the leash out of his belt. But he grabbed my hand and stopped me. We held a whispered conversation in the woods.
�What do you think you&#8217;re doing?� Rolin asked in a low voice.
�In case we have to move quickly. No matter how much it turns me on, I can&#8217;t afford to fall and choke because the leash is attached to your belt.�
�Oh.� I could see the blush on his face even in the dim moonlight.
I quickly used my spear to cut off most of the leash, leaving about two feet hanging from my collar. I would have removed the collar, but only the lace attached from the top of my corset to my collar kept the corset from toppling forward.
I quickly wrapped the remaining 3 feet of leather around my belt. �They&#8217;re watching the bridge too closely. Is there any point in the river we can ford across and avoid the bridge altogether?�
�No. There shouldn&#8217;t be. But I&#8217;ve never explored the river. The bandits make this area too dangerous to explore.�
I nodded. �Anything else I should know about them? Do they have dogs?�
Rolin squinted as he tried to remember. �They have dogs. I remember hearing them talk about hunting with dogs while they were collecting the fare from us once.�
�Then we have to get rid of the deer meat. The dogs might catch the odor.�
Rolin took off my bear cloak and began to open it. 
I grabbed his hand and stopped him. �Don&#8217;t bother. The cloak smells like the meat now. And we don&#8217;t have time to wash it.�
Rolin looked at me in surprise. �You really are a warrior huh?�
�A priestess. The soldiers we were with taught us how to fight though.�
�So what are we going to do?�
�I&#8217;m going to scout the forest close to both sides of the bridges. Eventually, we&#8217;ll have to find a way to get across. Wait here for me.� I ordered as I got up and began to move silently through the trees toward the bridge.

Chapter 5
I found two men in the trees watching the bridge. One on either side of the road. As I slipped silently back to Rolin, I considered my options. The problem was that it would be difficult to silence one without alerting the other. I couldn&#8217;t really climb up the trees without making noise or shaking the trees either. I could wait until they changed the watch, but I had no clue when, and then I might find myself dealing with four people rather than just two. I stepped out behind Rolin and crouched next to him. He jumped in the air and spun towards me waving his knife wildly.
�Holy shit. Don&#8217;t scare me like that.� He hissed.
�Put your knife away. There are two bandits watching the bridge. They both have crossbows. Do you think you could shoot one in the throat while I throw my spear at the other?�
Rolin&#8217;s face paled visibly in the dim light. �I&#8217;ve uh� never killed anyone before.�
I mentally smacked myself. What was I doing? Asking a fourteen year old boy to help me kill another man.
�Nevermind then.�
Rolin grabbed my hand. �No no. I can do it. I just need time to� get ready.�
I rubbed his hand gently. �No. We&#8217;ll find another way. Tell me exactly what they do when you and your father cross the bridge?�
Rolin answered promptly. �They stop you in the middle of the bridge and tell you to pay them.�
�Where did they come from though?&nbsp; Did they all approach you from one side of the bridge? And do they stop you going toward Betancuria or leaving?�
He thought a little this time before replying. �Two or three of them come at us from both sides of the bridge when we reached the middle and they charges us fare both ways.�
I ran my hand through his straggly blonde hair. �And how do they collect the fare?�
�Well, they point the cross bow in our faces, and then we hand them the money.� He said pulling my hands away from his hair.
�Do they all approach you though? Or does only one person walk up to you? And after they take your money, do they go back their original ways? Or do they all leave together?� I asked as he guided my hands together behind my back.
He began to tie my hands together using the cuffs. �They all walk up to us and threaten us. I think it makes them more intimidating. After stealing from us, they go back to the side they came from.�
�Rolin? This isn&#8217;t a good time.� I murmured as I tried to tug my hands apart.
�I just don&#8217;t like you rubbing my hair. It makes me feel young.� He blushed furiously.
�I&#8217;m sorry Rolin. I didn&#8217;t mean anything by it.� I knelt at his feet and kissed the crotch of his pants. �I have an idea, but I need your help.�
Rolin responded without any hesitation at all. �Okay.�
I smiled at him, appreciating his trust and rubbed my face against the crotch of his pants as I spoke. �I want you to go up to the middle of the bridge. When they approach you, pay the fare, and walk across. I&#8217;ll kill the bandits heading back towards me. After you get across, when the bandits start to leave you to climb back to their trees, turn around and tell them you dropped something. They&#8217;ll definitely ask what it is. Tell them it&#8217;s a purse of yellow rocks you found in a cave near your house. They&#8217;ll think gold and follow you back across. Once you cross the bridge again, run into the forest as fast as you can while I kill the other ones who followed you.�
He placed his hands on my shoulders and leaned me back so he could see my face. �Couldn&#8217;t we just disguise you? Say you were really sick and contagious? Like pretend you&#8217;re my sick grandma and I&#8217;m taking you to Betancuria to get you healed?�
I was shocked. His plan was so much simpler and much more likely to succeed. �But we don&#8217;t have anything to disguise me with.�
�We were going to dispose of your cloak anyways right?�
I nodded. �True. Alright, I&#8217;ll trust you with all the talking then?�
Rolin reached out and traced the top of my breasts. My full breasts were thrust forward proudly thanks to my bound arms behind my back. �I doubt they&#8217;d think you were my grandma if they heard you. Your voice is too sexy.�
�You&#8217;ll be using my spear then. It wouldn&#8217;t look right for an old lady to be carrying a weapon. I have to admit though, I&#8217;d feel a lot safer if you knew how to use it.�
He grinned wickedly at me as he untied the laces attached to my collar, causing the top of my corset to fall down and completely expose my erect nipples. �I guess I&#8217;ll need to remind you how well I can use my spear later.�
My quiet chuckle turned to a soft whimper as he roughly twisted one of my nipples. �If you&#8217;re plan works out, I&#8217;ll be more than happy to be impaled by your spear.�
So an hour later, when we crossed the bridge, I was completely wrapped in my bear skin cloak. All that showed beneath the cloak was calf length leather boots. Not exactly regular footwear for an old lady, but not unusual either. I walked hunched over in small steps. Rolin gripped my elbow through the cloak to guide me since I was keeping my face completely covered with the cloak.
�Halt!� Came a yell when we had walked a fair distance.
Rolin stopped, his grip on my elbow pulling me to a stop as well. I heard footsteps move towards us from both sides of the bridge.
I peeked a little through the cloak and saw four men in front of us. I assumed there were two behind. They were all dressed in black leather and wool. All had swords and crossbows though out of the four I could see, only one of them had his crossbow pointed at Rolin. I couldn&#8217;t really distinguish their features in the dark light, but I could see they were all large men and carried themselves with an air of confidence.
The one pointing his crossbow spoke. �Aren&#8217;t you that woodcutter&#8217;s son? What&#8217;re you doing here by yourself?�
�My grandmother is sick. I&#8217;m bringing her into Betancuria to find a doctor.� Rolin replied.
�Really now. Why&#8217;s she covered like that?� I heard bandit with the trigger happy crossbow ask. I assumed he was also the one I heard step toward me.
Rolin lied smoothly. �We think whatever she has might be contagious. My dad isn&#8217;t feeling well. He&#8217;s not as sick as her, but he&#8217;s not doing too well either.�
Trigger happy laughed. �Even I know that covering someone with a cloth isn&#8217;t going to keep contagious fevers from spreading and I&#8217;m no doctor.�
I felt someone grab the cloak around me and knew the game was up. Rather than waiting for them to expose me, I threw the cloak over my head and onto who I assumed was trigger happy. Spinning so that I stood back to back with Rolin, I grabbed the spear from his hand and pierced the throat of one of the bandits behind us. Muffled curses came from trigger happy as he began to pull off the cloak. The other bandit who had approached us from behind looked at his partner in shock. I took the opportunity to slash the spear across his throat. I immediately turned and pushed Rolin out of the way. Not a moment too soon. Trigger happy had finally gotten rid of the cloak and raised his crossbow to fire. His struggle with the cloak had knocked the crossbow bolt out of alightment. So when he fired it now, rather than flying into my face, it flew wildly into the spot Rolin had been standing a moment ago. At the same time, two other crossbow bolts hit me simultaneously. One of them stabbed me in the left shoulder, spinning me off balance, the other one glanced of the armor plating on my corset. I wasn&#8217;t cut and there was no blood, but I knew I&#8217;d have a bruise on my breasts. Even as I fell to the ground, off balance, I stabbed my spear into trigger happy. He looked at the spear in his stomach in disbelief. Then the remaining bandit who hadn&#8217;t fired his crossbow stepped next to my head and pointed his crossbow down at my face. I froze. The other two drew their swords and approached us warily. The one with the crossbow pointed at my face suddenly kicked out, connecting with my forehead, and blackness took me.

Chapter 6
I awoke to a splitting headache and a stabbing pain in my left shoulder that wasn&#8217;t helped by the constant swaying motion. I groaned and heard someone laugh above me. I opened my eyes and looked around. Rolin was walking next to me with his hands bound behind him. A bandit walked right behind him holding the ropes that bound his hands. His face showed bruises, meaning they had beat him after I was knocked unconscious. I was tied facing downward and the crossbow bolt in my shoulder had been removed. The wound bled continuously. The strain on my ankles and wrists told me they were attached to something above me. Tilting my head up, I saw they had used the cuffs on my wrists and ankles to tie me to my own spear. One bandit walked behind me holding on to the end of my spear. Another walked in front holding the other end of my spear. At least they haven&#8217;t removed my clothes. Yet. I gritted my teeth against the pain in my shoulder which was far worse than my headache.
�You have to treat her shoulder or it might get infected.� Rolin stated tiredly. It sounded like a statement he had repeated a lot. 
�Shut up boy.� The bandit behind Rolin muttered and yanked sharply on the ropes, causing Rolin to stumble.
I saw that we were no longer on the road. Instead we were traveling through the forest on a path that was obviously very well hidden. A careless movement from one of the men carrying me slammed my shoulder into a passing tree. Pure pain flared through me and I blacked out again.
When I awoke, I could hear many voices speaking around me. I kept my eyes closed and feigned unconsciousness. Judging by the heat, the odor of smoke, and the crackling sounds, I knew I was near a fire. I tried to move my hands slightly. I couldn&#8217;t. By the strain my weight placed on my ankles, I guessed I was still tied up the same way I had been carried here. There was nothing I could do, so I opened my eyes and looked around. Rolin was bound next to me. He was held in place by a thick pole embedded in the ground. I looked up, and indeed, I was still tied to my own spear which was held up by frames that looked remarkably similar to the frame Rolin had used to cook and afterwards tie me up to. Except these frames were much larger and looked much sturdier. There were about thirty men in the camp. There were rich tents scattered throughout the clearing and the men sat in groups around different fires. They all seemed to be bandits and many of them gave me predatory looks. I looked at Rolin who was staring at me, fear obvious in his face.
I murmured quietly to him. �I remember your dad saying there were only five or ten of them.�
�We never knew there were this many. They never had more than ten when they stopped us on the bridge.� He whispered in reply. 
�Why are we still alive? Did they ask you anything?� I asked.
�We&#8217;re still alive because they want you. I told them you were my sister and then they left me alone.�
He nodded his head at one of the men who was looking at me intently. �See the guy with brown hair and goatee? He&#8217;s in charge and he&#8217;s the one who questioned me.�
I never got a chance to reply as the man we were talking about walked toward us when he saw me looking at him. He stopped in front of me and gestured to his men.
�Untie her and bring her to my tent.� Then he turned and walked into the largest tent in the camp.
I was roughly untied and pulled to the tent where they pushed me in. I landed on my hands and knees, a jarring shock of pain lancing through my shoulder forced a tiny scream from me.
He knelt before me, suddenly extremely courteous. �Greetings lovely lady. I&#8217;m Robin Hood and the men in this camp are my merry men.�
I looked at him incredulously. �Really? Your parents named you Robin Hood?�
He looked flustered. �Of course not. I named myself after the infamous bandit.�
�You do know that Robin Hood only robbed the rich and gave wealth to the poor?�
�It&#8217;s not my fault not enough rich people travel these roads.� He snapped.
I grinned. I couldn&#8217;t help teasing this man. �Your men don&#8217;t look merry though.�
He gave me a wicked smile. �Dear, they might be very merry very soon if you continue to speak to me like this.�
I immediately wiped the smile off my face and shut my mouth.
�Good. Now here&#8217;s my offer. You&#8217;ve killed three of my men and I hear you&#8217;re competent with a spear. I&#8217;ll allow you to join my bandit group. You&#8217;ll help us rob travelers, and you&#8217;ll live here with us. You&#8217;ll be my personal whore of course and you&#8217;ll sleep with whoever I choose to share you with.� He announced grandly.
�I&#8217;m not a whore.� I responded automatically.
�Oh please! Look at the way you&#8217;re dressed dear! Though I do appreciate the view. In fact, I&#8217;m going to insist you wear less if you join us.� his eyes ran over all the bare skin on my exposed cleavage, my midriff, and my legs to emphasize his point.
There was no way I could explain to him that Rolin had cut up my clothing to tie me up and still have him believe that Rolin was my brother.
�And if I refuse?� I asked.
�I tie you up and leave you outside for my men to use you freely however they want. I&#8217;d wager it&#8217;d take a month for my men to lose interest in you. When they do, and it no longer becomes worthwhile to feed you, we&#8217;ll dispose of you. Oh and of course your brother dies a painful death.� He stated in an offhand manner.
I paled and asked carefully, �So if I agree, my brother is freed?�
�We&#8217;re going to keep your brother hostage until we can be sure you&#8217;re one of us. Then we&#8217;ll free him.�
I nodded. �How do I prove I&#8217;m one of you?�
He leered at me. �You can start by taking off your clothes and spreading you legs.�
Moments later, I was completely naked, no cuffs or collars, and stood with my back to Robin, bent over with my hands on the back of a chair. He ran his hands over my thighs, then moving to the inside of my thighs, he forced me to spread my legs wide.
�Hm� look at how your beautiful cunt gushes dear!� He exclaimed, pulling his sopping wet fingers from my pussy.
I groaned in response as I felt a tongue begin to lick me expertly. His tongue played over my vagina and clit endlessly, causing me to whimper and shiver with arousal. He continued to lick, occasionally thrusting his tongue deep within my wet folds until I found myself shuddering in an intense orgasm.
He stepped back laughing. �That was a beautiful orgasm dear. Now get on your knees. It&#8217;s your turn to reciprocate.�
I willingly turned around and sank to my knees. I reached out with my hands to pull his black leather pants down, but he slapped my hands away. I noticed that the pain in my left shoulder was gone. Apparently, the magic the Priest King had gifted me worked both ways. Having sex would heal me as well.
�Use your delectable mouth for that. Your hands are to remain flat on the ground dear.�
I leaned forward and began to attempting to untie the string holding his pants up with my tongue. My efforts forced me press my face into his pants, feeling his hard cock against my cheek. It took a while, but eventually, I managed to untie the strings holding his pants. I then gripped his pants with my teeth and pulled downwards. His cock sprang free from their confines and I leaned forward to lick it. As I alternated between licking and sucking him, I heard a sudden uproar outside the tent. Robin however, was too busy ejaculating into my mouth to notice anything around him. I quickly swallowed the salty liquid in my mouth as moments later, a man burst into the tent and began yelling.
�Hood! We have to get out of here! There&#8217;s an army marching right down on us!�
I stayed on my hands and knees, licking Robin&#8217;s limp cock as he looked at the man with scorn. �Nonsense, we would have seen them on the bridge long before.�
The bandit shouted in panic. �They&#8217;re not coming from the bridge! They&#8217;re approaching us from the north! They slaughtered a hunting party that ran into them!�
Robin straightened, and grabbed my hair to move my head away from his cock. �How much time do we have?�
�None! They&#8217;ll be on us any moment!�
Robin quickly pulled his pants back on, still grabbing my hair, and strode out of his tent, forcing me to follow him nude on my hands and knees. Chaos reigned in the camp. Men ran everywhere, gathering weapons, buckling on armor. Rolin was still tied to the pole in the middle of the camp.
Robin raised his voice and yelled, �Gentlemen! An army approaches. We will-�
I never found out whether he meant to order them to flee or to fight. His passionate speech was cut short as men in shiny armor with red and white coloring on it burst into the clearing. These men were foot soldiers, armed with a pike and sword each. Robin released my hair and jumped towards the men waving his sword wildly and screaming something unintelligible. Crossbow bolts flew through the air as thick and random as the screams of pain and the grunts of exertion. I stood and sprinted toward Rolin. He looked at me with relief as I grabbed my spear, still lying on the ground from where they had untied me and proceeded to cut him free. Rolin shouted something just as I cut the ropes tying his hands. I couldn&#8217;t hear him through the noise of battle, but he was looking behind me with undisguised fear. I turned and saw a large man in red and white armor step toward me, his pike already in stabbing motion. I lunged under the pike, and stabbed him in the face with my spear. He gurgled in pain before he toppled over. Turning back to free Rolin, I noticed the pike I had dodged was now buried in his chest. His eyes were already dimming in death, and he smiled weakly at me as the weight of the pike slowly pulled it out of his chest with a river of blood. Tears stung my eyes as grief and guilt flooded through me. With no reason to remain and get slaughtered like the rest of the bandits, I dashed the tears from my eyes and sprinted out of the clearing and into the trees. 
I had no idea where I was going or which way to run, but at that moment, none of those were major priorities. A couple hours later, the sounds of battle had faded, and I discovered that I was completely lost. My eyes were still wet with tears, I was nude, and my feet were bruised and cut from running barefoot through the forest. I didn&#8217;t lie to myself. I knew I didn&#8217;t love Rolin. Yet in some ways, he felt like family. He cared about me, even if only just for sex. And if I hadn&#8217;t showed up at his cabin what seemed an eternity ago, he wouldn&#8217;t have died at the end of a pike. Guilt weighed me down and I sat on the ground in despair. I had no clue where I was, I had just been the primary factor that caused the death of a fourteen year old boy, and my mission to retrieve the artifact seemed doomed. That&#8217;s when I heard the sounds of the river gurgling nearby. I stumbled towards the river, intent on drinking water and perhaps bathing myself, when I was promptly grabbed. A hand was held over my mouth while another was wrapped around my arms, pinning them and my spear to my side. I got a glimpse of many dark figures sitting or standing on the bank of the river.
The man grabbing me from behind pressed his manhood against the crack of my ass and whispered, �Well dear. It looks like we meet again.�










So originally, I intended for Miriam to enter Betancuria as a mercenary and help fight against the invading army� but after writing a couple chapters, I got bored. So after finding myself completely unmotivated in writing about the siege, I decided to go back, and write another scenario where things end up differently.
Chapter 7
The warm camp fire cast flickering shadows over Robin Hood&#8217;s face as he sat next to me in front of the blaze. He used a thin branch to prod the embers, raising the heat temporarily as he explained. �I was wondering what we were going to do dear. Eighteen bandits, poorly armed, almost no money, half of us slightly wounded, and our base of operations occupied by that cursed Dhorn army. You have to admit, the situation seemed dire no? I was just considering disbanding our merry band, and then you stumbled right into my arms dear.� 
He reached out and slapped my bare ass cheeks happily. I was naked, gagged, my hands tied behind me at both wrists and elbows. Kneeling with the side of my face pressed into the ground so I could still see Robin, I had my buttocks raised vulnerably in the cold evening air. Robin&#8217;s foot resting lightly on my head threatened to grind my face into the ground if I attempt to raise my head. I found myself screaming into the disgusting sock they had used for a gag and bucking my hips wildly at the pain as he continued to spank my ass to the amusement of the watching bandits.
Stopping to rub my reddened ass cheeks that he had punished, he continued his explanation in spite of my muffled moans of relief and satisfaction. �Are you wondering how you&#8217;re going to help us out dear? Well, I&#8217;m going to sell you in Betancuria. I imagine after we clean you up, you&#8217;ll sell for a lot. Probably enough for us to buy new weapons, clothing, and perhaps even fund our relocation! Unfortunately for us, but lucky for you dear, since we&#8217;re going to sell you, we&#8217;re not going to take turns using you. The potential buyers might consider you damaged goods if your cunt or butt hole gets too loose. I suppose we could all take turns using your mouth, but frankly dear, I don&#8217;t trust you not to bite if you know we won&#8217;t really damage you��
I groaned helplessly as his fingers began a slow dance from the globes of my ass down the short distance to my pussy. Anticipation flared through me, as he rubbed his fingers over my slit, his thumb finding and pressing gently on the sensitive little nub that quickly became engorged. I felt my nipples harden and press into the ground uncomfortably as my vagina began to throb. His insistent fingers continued to steadily drive me toward an orgasm, until I was humping my ass into his fingers and moaning into the gag uncontrollably. Then, when he sensed I was on the verge of orgasm, he backed off, leaving me unfulfilled. Whimpering, I felt my back arch as my hips tried to follow his fingers shamelessly. Taking his foot off my head, he bent down and pulled the dirty sock out of my mouth before tossing it back to one of his bandits.
�Suck Jared&#8217;s cock and I&#8217;ll let you finish.� He commanded and gestured to one of the eager bandits who quickly stepped in front of me, pulling a large penis out of his dark leather breeches. Apparently, Robin wanted to make sure I wouldn&#8217;t bite before he risked his own prick. Jared was already aroused, with precum leaking out. He eagerly grabbed my hair, pulling my head forward, and shoving his rod into my mouth despite my whimper of protest. I gagged painfully as he rammed it against the back of my throat and quickly tried to swallow to hold his large, thick penis down my throat.
�Good girl.� I heard Robin comment as his fingers resumed their work on my vulnerable gasping vagina.
I moaned in response to the rhythmic plunging of his fingers into my well lubricated pussy and began to suck on the thick dick enthusiastically despite my gagging as Jared fucked my face. It wasn&#8217;t long before I felt a huge wave of pleasure wash through my body. With my vagina contracting wildly around Robin&#8217;s fingers, I screamed into Jared&#8217;s large penis trapped in my throat. That apparently set him off and I tasted his sperm spraying into my mouth as he pulled out. I gasped in exhaustion from the orgasm and nearly collapsed, but another bandit stepped forward and grabbed my hair, pulling me back up.
I spent the rest of the night and most of the morning pleasuring all eighteen of the bandits with my mouth multiple times while they rewarded me by plunging their fingers into my sopping vagina, bringing me to orgasm again and again. I did not bite or resist. Though Robin Hood didn&#8217;t mention it, I knew there were many ways to punish me that would leave me mostly undamaged. Plus, the constant blow jobs worked the magic that the Priest King of Floren had placed upon me and I felt the cuts on my feet from the panicked run in the forest healing. There was still a slight soreness in my mouth from pleasuring so many people so many times, but any damage I might have incurred during oral sex seemed to have been healed along with my feet. This healing only reinforced my decision to obey them and avoid punishment if possible. If they did punish me and found out that I would heal the wounds during sex, I somehow doubted my treatment would take a turn for the better.

Chapter 8
We arrived at Betancuria in the afternoon four days later. Four days of constantly using my mouth to pleasure eighteen different men during the night and in the mornings. I had indeed become an excellent �cock sucker� as Jared took pleasure in informing me. While the rest of the bandits had seemed satisfied in using my mouth, especially when I became well practiced in the art of fellatio, Jared constantly pressured Robin Hood to allow them access to my pussy or asshole. Robin&#8217;s adamant refusal seemed to have sparked a rivalry between the two, one that I had hoped to exploit despite my bound and nude state. Unfortunately, I never got the chance as we came within sight of the city.
Betancuria reminded me of a crushed melon. The huge iron gates that spanned the entrance hung askew, the iron bent and twisted inward, testament to the mighty battering ram that lay abandoned by the entrance. Smoke still rose from within the city, barely visible over the high walls that were devoid of troops. Corpses no longer littered the ground outside the city, but the remnants of broken weapons and arrows scattered in the clearing around the city told enough. The yelling and screaming of men along with the clash of metal striking metal, and the unmistakable rumble of rocks striking fortified walls could still be heard coming from within the city walls. A large group of about forty well armed Dhorn soldiers in their trademark red and white colored armor stood outside the gate and watched us approach. About half were on horseback with crossbows, the rest held pikes and long swords. With a slap to my ass, Robin walked toward them, apparently unconcerned. A leash attached to my neck pulled me forward as Jared gave it a tug. My arms were still bound behind me at wrist and elbows, I was still nude, and worse of all, I was gagged with the dirty sock again. I hated it. Whenever I wasn&#8217;t eating, drinking, or giving blow jobs, I was gagged with that dirty sock. It was humiliating. Constant blow jobs in the mornings and nights had at least ensured that my bare feet weren&#8217;t too badly cut from each day&#8217;s marching. Even though the bandits seemed to enjoy me and didn&#8217;t hold back, I had no illusions about how I must have looked. I smelled like semen, my black hair was coated with flaking crusts of semen, and I was no doubt covered with dry semen. In short, I&#8217;m sure I looked like a well used slave.
The horsemen immediately rode forward and cut off any chance of retreat or evasion as they surrounded the back half of the group. Meanwhile, the foot soldiers moved forward and stopped Robin&#8217;s direct approach. A man who looked to be in charge due to his beautiful red cape that swept across his broad armored shoulders, and his very ornate sword, drawn and pointed toward Robin, stepped out from among the foot soldiers, quite a surprise since I would have expected an officer to be mounted among the horsemen.
�Identify yourselves.� he commanded. He was tall and from what I could tell from the armor covering his torso, very well muscled. The rich armor covering him included a helm that was complete with a face guard that muffled his voice and hid his features. Even so, his voice was low and sharp, filled with an air of command that expected instant obedience.
�We are merchants good Sir. We merely seek to enter the city to sell our goods.� Robin replied, a slight tremor in his voice betrayed his nervousness.
The well armored man stepped closer to Robin in a calculated move meant to intimidate him. From Robin&#8217;s nervous step back, it was obviously working. �Where are your goods Merchant?� he asked, putting extra sarcasm in the word merchant.
Robin looked around frantically at his men. They were all ill equipped, only carrying what they had managed to carry out when retreating from their campsite. They also had some of the meat and fruits they had managed to scavenge on the journey, but overall, they looked nothing like merchants. Spotting me, he then grabbed my leash from Jared and tugged my forward. �This slave is. We&#8217;re going to sell her in the city.�
The armored man gave a nod to his soldiers who moved forward, taking my leash from Robin and leading me away. �The Dhorn empire has taken over the city, and we don&#8217;t allow slavery.�
Relief flooded through me as I looked back and grinned despite my gag at Robin. He was gaping in surprise and looked helplessly between me and the armored officer confronting him as I was led farther away. Jared on the other hand, was leveling a look of pure fury at me. Giving him a wink, I swayed my hips seductively to taunt him as I walked away.
I was led to a large white tent where the officers that guarded the entrance probably spent their time. The inside of the tent was filled with luxuries. A mahogany desk with papers and quills spread over it stood in the center. A couch covered with the exotic pelt of some animal occupied a good portion of the tent. At the very back, an ivory bathtub stood by itself. I was deposited, still bound and gagged in front of the desk.
�Don&#8217;t move.� The soldier who had led me in told me with a distasteful sniff.
I couldn&#8217;t very well argue thanks to the gag and there wasn&#8217;t much I could touch with my arms bound behind me. I was mildly humiliated by the way he treated me like a dirty animal, but then, I was covered with caking semen, so I must have smelled quite horrendous.
When the officer who had hopefully saved me from a life of slavery walked in, he found me kneeling in front of his desk.
�Damn it. My men didn&#8217;t even untie you?� He asked as he began to pull off his armor. As he removed his helmet, I saw his grey hair and the slight wrinkles on his face which brought an estimate of his age to around fifty. Despite his age, he was very well muscled and I watched in fascination at the sheen of sweat that highlighted his muscular arms as they flexed while he pulled off his gloves. 
He signed in relief, �I&#8217;m never going to get used to the hot weather here.�
Bending forward he began to pull the ropes off. �I can never untie knots while I&#8217;m wearing gauntlets.� He explained.
His head bent close to my hair as he worked on the ropes binding my elbows. I saw his nose wrinkle at the sight of the white mess in my hair. �Bring hot water for a bath!� He yelled to the men outside as he finished untying my elbows and wrists. By the time the gag was off, hot water was already being poured into the ivory tub at the back of the tent.
Minutes later, I sighed in relief as I soaked in the hot water. It had been a long time since I had last taken a bath in hot water. I had learned that the name of the Dhorn officer was Drake before he had stepped out to give me privacy. I scrubbed my skin and hair thoroughly with the bar of soap and afterward, lay in the tub inhaling the calming scent of lilac that perfumed the water. Eventually, as the water began to cool, I emerged and found that a towel and clothing had been left for me. Clothing made for men, but still better than going nude. After drying myself with the towel, I quickly donned the pair of baggy breeches, and too large shirt. Both were of good quality and highly suspected that they belonged to Drake. The boots were too large but after walking on my feet for four days, it was a relief to finally have something between my sore feet and the ground, even if I did heal all the cuts on my feet at the end of the day. Fully dressed, I stepped out of the tent and met Drake waiting for me.
�My clothing fits you as badly as I suspected they would. But you look much prettier now then you did when you were naked.� He commented, grinning down at me. He had put his armor back on but left his helmet off.
�Thank you for lending me your clothes Sir Drake.�
�You&#8217;re welcome girl. You smell much better too.� He added quite impolitely.
He put a hand on my elbow and began leading me through the broken gates of the city. �By the way, I&#8217;m not a Sir. Only nobles need to be called Sir. Call me Lieutenant Drake or just Drake.� Turning to the men guarding the gate he gave quick commands for them to detain anyone else who approached until he returned.
�Why did you help me?� I asked, genuinely curious about what he expected in return.
�I got a daughter about your age back home. Haven&#8217;t seen her for two years now. But when I saw how those men had been treating you, I couldn&#8217;t help thinking what my daughter would say if I didn&#8217;t stop them. And after I stopped them, well I couldn&#8217;t let you go into the city looking like a whore. We rounded up all the whores yesterday and threw them in prison.�
�So slavery and prostitution are banned in the Dhorn empire?�
�Mostly. Unless you&#8217;re a noble. They call their slaves by another name. Servants. But it&#8217;s really the same thing. Unpaid servants who have no choice.�
I nodded. �If slavery is illegal, how did those nobles obtain their unpaid servants?� I asked.
�They&#8217;re nobles. They can choose whoever they want that isn&#8217;t nobility to serve them.�
�Oh.� I looked around. Betancuria was a large city but seemed mostly empty of citizens. Some shops were still open but most of the shops as well as the houses had their doors and windows closed. I assumed that most of the people were hiding in their houses or shops since large numbers of Dhorn soldiers patrolled the streets. Many of the buildings were in ruins, burning with trails of smoke drifting up into the air and the sounds of men killing and dying was now louder then outside the city walls.
�The fighting looks to be over, but it doesn&#8217;t sound that way.� I commented to Drake.
He steered me toward one of the open shops with his hand on my elbow. �The Betancurian soldiers retreated to the Castle when the city gates fell. So now we&#8217;re laying siege to the castle itself. Shouldn&#8217;t last much longer then a day or two.�
I looked at the shop Drake led me to. The name of the shop was in a language I couldn&#8217;t read, but the needle and thread symbol that decorated the name plate along with the picture of a woman in a dress made it quite obvious. �You&#8217;re buying me clothes?� I asked in surprise.
�Well, I can&#8217;t just leave you in the city dressed in my clothing. Anyways, my wife gave me that shirt. I want it back.� He teased.
Despite Drake&#8217;s urging to get one of the dresses, I figured that searching for the stolen artifact in a dress would prove difficult. Especially since it was likely that I&#8217;d have to do some breaking and entering in my quest for the artifact. I looked in the mirror at my current choice. Black boots that rose up to mid calf, brown leather pants that hugged my legs and buttocks, a dark blue blouse made of cotton with a black bodice that accentuated the hourglass curve of my waist and lifted my ample breasts so that I wouldn&#8217;t need a bra. Much to Drake&#8217;s very vocal protests, I had unbuttoned the top four buttons of my blouse, showing a generous expanse of cleavage. But I could tell by the way he kept eyeing the opening in my blouse that he enjoyed the view.
�Thank you so much Drake. Is there anything I can do�?� I let my question trail off as we left the shop.
He gave me a quick grin that lit up his whole face and made him look twenty years younger. �I&#8217;m flattered but I have a wife. I&#8217;m helping you because I can easily afford it and I&#8217;m not sure I could live with myself if I had left you with those ruffians.�
I gave him a teasing grin back. �I never said I was going to repay you by sleeping with you. What happened to those ruffians anyways?�
�What else could you offer me besides sex?� he asked. I decided not to answer that.
Drake continued, �As for the ruffians, there really isn&#8217;t much we can do about them. Our orders are to let everyone into the city, but to let no one leave. Anyways, stop by the barracks and apply for a cleaning job if you can&#8217;t find another in the city. Just tell them I sent you. I have to return to my post.� He finished in a rush. Apparently, my proposition had disturbed him.
As Drake hurried away, I considered my situation. My jaws were still a little sore, but other than that, my ordeal had little effect on me. I needed money, which meant I needed a job, or I needed to steal. But since Robin Hood was now in the city, I would need to avoid him, and wandering the streets looking for someone to rob was not exactly the best way to avoid him. So job it was.

Chapter 9
I deftly swayed my hips and avoided the hand reaching out to grope my butt. Swinging by a table filled with patrons I quickly deposited the tray filled with sweet meats and laughed in response to an offer to sit on a lap while shaking my head.
�More ale missy!� A man seated to my right yelled out. He was clearly inebriated and waved his flagon wildly in the air.
I gave him a grin and a nod before quickly swaying back towards the kitchen carrying used plates and utensils that I had cleared from another table. Quickly depositing the dirty dishes into a tub of soapy water, I grinned apologetically at the beautiful girl who was washing those dishes. The girl was new; we had both started our jobs at The Bear Pit tavern yesterday. For some reason or other, she was confined to the kitchens while I was sent to serve the patrons. She had been crying all day yesterday and looked quite depressed today. I didn&#8217;t ask why, but it wasn&#8217;t hard to guess. The Dhorn invasion meant lots of dead people. The girl had probably lost family members and thus had to pick up a job. She was also my roommate. While I was thankful that Nathan, the owner of the tavern, had provided us with rooms to sleep, I had found it difficult to sleep with the constant weeping from the girl last night. Despite my attempts to comfort and befriend her, she had ignored me and continued to sob all night. The girl was undeniably beautiful though. She looked to be about eighteen, with blonde hair that just touched her shoulders, large blue grey eyes that were currently red from crying, a straight patrician nose, small pouting mouth that looked very kissable, she was taller than me by a few inches, but had smaller curves to her figure.
She looked over at me and gave me eye contact for the first time. With those tear stained blue grey eyes watching me and that shy nod. I couldn&#8217;t help it. Something in me felt an overwhelming compassion for her and I reached out, giving her a hug. I felt her body stiffen then relax as she hugged me back, her soap and water drenched hands soaked the back of my dress as she hugged me. It was probably the first time she had been hugged since her family members died.
�I&#8217;ll listen if you need someone to talk to.� I whispered into her ear.
�Thanks.� She murmured.
�ALE!!!!� I heard the drunken patron outside the kitchen yell.
I sighed in exasperation and rolled my eyes as the beautiful girl in front of me giggled.
�I&#8217;m Miriam.�
�I&#8217;m Pr� I&#8217;m Aaricia.�
I nodded and gave her a second hug before I moved off to pick up the ale. I was slightly curious as to what name she was going to give me at first, but if she wanted to hide her name, that wasn&#8217;t my business. I stepped back out into the common room with a filled pitcher of ale and immediately felt the disconcerting sensation of many lustful eyes on to me. Even though I had been doing this for a day now, I still hadn&#8217;t gotten used to the attention that the skimpy dress uniform I had been provided garnered. It was a brown one piece dress that hugged my figure. Small straps hung over my shoulder to hold the dress up. It showed large amounts of cleavage and lots of skin in the back. The bottom of the dress barely went to mid thigh. This resulted in lots of groping and propositions as I moved through the customers. But after hours of serving, I had gotten adept at dodging questing hands. Of course, my short height was an advantage for me. The other woman serving the customers found that her dress barely covered her crotch and garnered a lot more attention than me. However, in her case, from the way she was humping the fingers buried in her pussy, the attention probably wasn&#8217;t unwanted. It did leave me with a lot more of the work though. I sighed and began pouring more ale for Mr. Drunk patron who began eyeing my ample breasts and leering at me. I turned, failed to avoid the slap that jiggled my ass and almost caused me to trip as I headed back to the kitchen. I had been working at my new job for a day and I already hated it. Maybe I should reconsider the whole thief thing.
Chellah, a plump friendly woman in charge of the kitchens, walked up to me and took flagon while handing me a plate of meat that smelled like roast. �If you plan to be a thief, don&#8217;t do it in the tavern, sweet. Master Nathan would whip your hide off if he caught you stealing from the patrons. And make sure you join the thieves guild. They don&#8217;t like rogue thieves.�
I looked at her blankly. Oh shit. Did I say �reconsider the whole thief thing� part out loud?
She saw the expression on my face and burst out laughing. �Oh dear. You didn&#8217;t mean for anyone to hear you eh? Don&#8217;t worry I won&#8217;t tell. But you be careful about how loud you talk next time.� She chuckled and reached over to tuck a stray strand of black hair back behind my ears.
I tried for an innocent look. �What&#8217;s the thieves guild Chellah?�
�Why sweetie, they control what&#8217;s stolen and make sure thieves don&#8217;t steal too much to keep crime from going crazy and drawing the attention of the law.�
Wow. Thievery refined into an exclusive club with rules and everything. �Oh. How can I join the thieves guild?� I asked, no longer adopting the innocent look.
Chella frowned. �I don&#8217;t think joining the thieves guild would be a good decision sweetie.�
Innocent seemed to work much better with her. �Please tell me Chellah? Shouldn&#8217;t it be my decision?�
�Fine. I suppose there&#8217;s no stopping you if you&#8217;re determined. You&#8217;d just ask someone else, and they might turn you in to the Dhorn. I&#8217;ll tell Vico to meet up with you.�
I gave her a big smile and a hug which she happily returned. �Where do I go to meet Vico?�
Rubbing my back, she replied, �Vico will find you child. Now go give that plate of beef to the man sitting in front of the fire.�

Chapter 10
I stepped out of The Bear Pit tavern and squinted at the glow from the setting sun. I had changed back into the clothes Drake had bought for me, much more suitable for wandering the streets. Following the tugging sensation that led me down the cobblestone streets towards the richer sections of the city, I found myself in front of a huge stone building with a group of Dhorn soldiers guarding the entrance. I immediately began to wander in another direction so that they wouldn&#8217;t notice my interest in the building. Looking across the plaza, I saw that the gates to the castle had been breached. The sounds of warfare had come to a halt during the late afternoon yesterday, telling us that the siege of the castle was ended. In fact, if I squinted, I could see the head of the king and queen impaled on the spikes of the broken gate. Soldiers still guarded the entrance, perhaps to prevent people from removing the heads of their king and queen from their indignity, but most likely to prevent thieves from robbing the castle. 
I had felt the tugging sensation three days ago when I had been marching under Robin Hood&#8217;s leash. It was the sensation that told me the artifact was near. Now I knew that it was located in a building well guarded by the Dhorn. I needed more information before I could attempt to retrieve it though. As to how to retrieve that information� I supposed my best bet was to ask Drake. He seemed to like me well enough.
I wandered back toward the poorer sections, looking for a building large enough to serve as barracks for the Dhorn troops. This late, very few people wandered the streets, especially because of all the recent violence. Beggars still huddled in their odd corners, and a few men were closing down their shops, but the streets were otherwise quiet. The marching of Dhorn patrols provided a rhythmic cadence that was somehow soothing as I wandered along. Stepping in front of a passing Dhorn patrol, I opened my mouth to ask them where their barracks were.
Instead of pausing though, one of them pushed me out of the way with a snarl. �Out of the way whore. We&#8217;re on duty.�
Obviously he didn&#8217;t really think I was a whore, otherwise I&#8217;d be in jail rather than on my ass in the street. Still, it was with a disgruntled air that I got back on my feet and dusted off the seat of my pants. A boy that looked no older than ten ran up to me as I finished dusting off my pants.
�Message for you lady!� he announced, puffing out his chest importantly.
�Oh? From who?� I asked, kneeling down to look the boy in the eyes.
�Big man! Black hair! Big swords! Looked scary!�
 I took the message and looked at it. Weird scribbles met my eye. Damn I couldn&#8217;t read it. I really had to start learning to read Betancurian. Or whatever they called it. I looked at the boy. It couldn&#8217;t hurt to ask him. �Did you read this message?�
�Of course not!� he denied loudly. His eyes shifting to the bottom left and his fidgeting told me he was lying.
�You&#8217;re lying. What do you remember of it?� I asked.
�Something about meeting at the west pier lady.� He mumbled, embarrassed to be caught reading the message.
I nodded confidently. �Lead me there and I won&#8217;t tell the man who gave you the message that you read it.�

Chapter 11
The west pier was deserted. Visibility was dim as the last rays from the setting sun had long since disappeared. The moonlight showed scraps of broken boats and discarded material lay scattered around on the dirty wooden docks. The sound of waves beating a steady cadence against the pier was the only interruption in the chilling silence. The stink of rotting wood and unknown refuse filled my nose as I walked to the center of the pier alone; the child had deserted me after finding out I was penniless. I was pretty sure the man who sent the note was Vico, my contact for entrance to the thieves guild. But still, walking down a deserted pier that even the Dhorn patrols didn&#8217;t approach sent shivers of fear down my spine.
Just as I was about to give up and leave, a man stepped out of the ruins of an abandoned boat. He wasn&#8217;t tall, but his muscular physique made him intimidating nonetheless. The dark clothing and twin swords strapped to his waist helped. He approached me silently with a gliding swagger, reminding me of the giant cats from my homeland when they were stalking prey. When he got close enough for me to distinguish his features, I saw that his face was heavily scarred. His hair was as black as mine, but his skin was quite tanned whereas mine was very pale. A crooked nose, and cruel eyes that were narrowed into slits as he studied me made him very memorable. Almost every instinct in my body screamed for me to run. Big man? Check. At least from a child&#8217;s point of view. Black hair? Check. Big swords? Check. Scary? Double check. Odds that this was the man who sent the message? Laughably high.
�Who are you?� I asked. I was proud that my voice came out clear without showing any of the fear I felt.
He didn&#8217;t answer for a long moment. �Vico. Chellah described you. Said you wanted to join the thieves guild.�
It wasn&#8217;t a question, but I answered anyways. �That&#8217;s correct.�
�You know the rules?�
�Rules?� I asked.
He grimaced. �There are lots. But basically, you don&#8217;t steal from the businesses that pay us protection fees. You obey orders from guild leaders. And you keep our secrets secret.�
�I can live with those.� I readily agreed.
�Alright. I&#8217;ll tell you the specifics if you actually join us. If you want in, you gotta prove yourself to us. There&#8217;s a man by the name of Rick Cars. I want you to kill him. Do that and you&#8217;re in.� He said with a sneer that told me he didn&#8217;t think I was up to it.
�Uh� that&#8217;s it? Just a man named Rick Cars? You&#8217;re not going to tell me anything else?� I asked in disbelief.
He laughed. It was a wicked sound that raised goose bumps on my arms. �He just started his little gang in our city yesterday. He has about eight men in his group. They&#8217;re established in the area in front of the former whore houses. The Dhorn closed down the brothels and Rick moved his gang into that section. They&#8217;re robbing people who pass through and Rick never bothered to ask the thieves guild for permission. I don&#8217;t care how you kill him. You can spread your legs and try to get him to fuck you until his heart gives out. Whatever works. But you got three days. I&#8217;ll meet you here again, same time in three days.�
He looked me over contemptuously, his eyes lingering on my breasts. �Here.� He untied a sheathed stiletto from his belt and tossed it at my feet. Then turned and began to walk away. Almost as an afterthought, he added, �Oh yeah. They&#8217;ve been paying off the Dhorn patrols to leave them alone. So don&#8217;t expect the Dhorn to help you.�
Damn. I had assumed I would need to steal something to prove myself. Getting past eight men to assassinate their leader? That was completely different. Still, it couldn&#8217;t hurt to see how difficult it would be. With a sigh, I picked up the stiletto at my feet and hid it inside my bodice before moving toward the district where the brothels were located.

Chapter 12
I peeked around the corner and watched as what I presumed to be Rick Cars and his gang raped a woman. Apparently, they weren&#8217;t satisfied from just robbing her of all her money and jewelry, they had to rape her as well. The screams of pain that had drawn me to them had been studiously ignored by the Dhorn patrols who didn&#8217;t enter this area of the city. The dead man bleeding on the streets was all that was left of the man I guessed to be either her husband or her bodyguard. Three men stood on lookout while the rest of the them took turns and watched the woman beg for mercy. The faces were awfully familiar�
Shock ripped through me as I recognized them. They were better dressed, and cleaner, but without doubt, they were the bandits from outside Betancuria! Robin Hood and his band! But weren&#8217;t there eighteen of them before? Now there were only nine. I scanned the faces looking for Robin Hood. Knowing what to look for, I quickly found Robin Hood among the gang. His impressive cock was ramming the woman&#8217;s ass like a battering ram while she screamed in pain. I supposed if I was a better woman, I would try to stop them. But� I didn&#8217;t want to get raped or killed and I had to find out which one of them was Rick Cars. I watched as Robin Hood ejaculated in her and pulled out. Another man immediately took his place. The woman was obviously too exhausted to scream and merely whimpered at the new penetration. She no longer had the strength to beg. Even from my distance, the torches held by the bandits showed me blood dripping from her ravaged bottom. The men showed her no consideration and laughed as they took turns with her. When they tired of her, they tied her arms together behind her back, and pulled the rope upward, tying it off to the balcony above her. I watched as they pulled the rope tight, forcing her to bend her waist to keep her shoulders from getting dislocated. She was panting, her skin shone in the torchlight from the sweat that dripped from her body as she tried to balance bent over. Her ass was presented to the men while her heavy breasts swung freely below her. The bandits laughed and began to alternate between spanking her buttocks or her tits. I could hear her begging again as one of the bandits went into the building. Moments later he returned with a long metal rod with a large metal part at the end. I was too far away to see what it was, but I watched as he put the end of the metal rod in the fire. The woman began to scream and wail again when she saw the rod getting heated up. A branding iron! They were going to brand her! 
Anger flashed through me as her treatment reminded me of the way they had used my mouth. They hadn&#8217;t used my pussy or my ass since they had planned to sell me, but my jaw would have probably been dislocated if I hadn&#8217;t been constantly healing during sex. Of course, she didn&#8217;t have the option of healing anything. Branding her would be permanent. Despite my anger though, I didn&#8217;t do anything stupid and continued to watch as they branded her.
They eventually tired of her, and dragged her into one of the buildings that used to serve as a brothel. I watched them till dawn. They changed lookouts a couple of times, robbed a couple more people, killing those that were too poor. No other women stumbled into the alley for them to torture. As the sun began to peek over the walls of the city, the men withdrew into the building where they had dragged the woman they raped. Screw finding out who was Rick Cars. I was going to kill them all.
I began to walk back to the The Bear Pit tavern. I still had my waitressing gig later on today. I had watched the bandits all night, my anger, and if I was honest with myself, fear, keeping me awake. I still had to wait tables in the evening if I wanted to keep my room in The Bear Pit. In fact, I had to work till the end of the week if I wanted to get paid. I also had to find Drake and ask about the building where the artifact was held. And I had to find a way to kill nine men. I can&#8217;t remember how I made it back to The Bear Pit much less the room I shared with Aaricia, but somehow I stumbled into my bed and instantly fell asleep.

Chapter 13
I woke to the sensation of someone watching me. The last time I woke up like that, I had let Ojak tie me up and subsequently try to brand and sell me. This led to a whole set of complications which eventually resulted in a little boy named Rolin getting killed. Alarm bells ran through my head and I jumped out of bed ready to fight for my freedom. My head crashed into something hard and I heard myself scream and groan as I fell back, holding my head in pain. Wait. I couldn&#8217;t be screaming and groaning at the same time. Groaning was me. So who screamed? I looked over the edge of my bed and saw Aaricia rolling on the floor and holding her head. Shit. I could literally see my efforts to befriend my new roommate pouring down the drain as she squirmed on the floor.
�Sorry.� I murmured as I got off the bed and bent down to help her. �I&#8217;m not a morning person and you kind of startled me.�
She looked up at me angrily, tears pouring out of her eyes. Were her eyes always teary? Let&#8217;s see� I saw her two nights ago. Yep crying. I saw her washing dishes yesterday. Crying. I see her this morn- My thoughts were interrupted by her arrogant reproach. �How dare you! No one has ever hit me before.�
No one had ever hit her before? Wow. �Your parents never disciplined you?� That explained a lot. Like all the crying.
Her eyes widened as caution immediately replaced anger on her face. �N-no. My parents disciplined me. I meant that- Ne-never mind.� She stuttered out.
�Alright. Why were you watching me anyways?� I asked as I helped her to her feet.
�Yesterday, you said you wanted to talk. And I was lonely and�� her voice trailed off.
I looked out the window, it seemed to be mid afternoon. Maybe five or six hours of sleep. Oh well. I suppressed a sigh. �I&#8217;d love to talk. Maybe we could bathe together?�
She nodded, less shy now. �I would like that. I&#8217;m not used to having to wash myself- I mean, I&#8217;m not used to washing myself in these ugly tubs.� She said pointing to the giant metal tub that served as a bath tub.
She had tried to change what she was saying, but evidently she came from a family that had servants to bathe her. Not that it was any of my business. I settled in for some bonding time with my new roommate. At least her eyes weren&#8217;t teary anymore.
