Story:



New York 2008



The New Avengers were fighting for their lives. As for who were the New Avengers, they were America�s mightiest superhero team.&nbsp; Right now, they were fighting the robot army known as The Sentinels. The Sentinels stood over twenty feet and beams kept on coming out from their eyes and palms. 



Captain America shouted to his men, �We thought this was never going to happen but looks like it is�. As for what he was talking about, basically it was the American government, carrying out the war on terror, on American soil. The superheroes were deemed just last week, as a threat to national security, thanks to crazy Republican Senator, who believed that the government must have full power, in order to impose their new world order, on fellow Americans.



New York was just one city, now in a grip as bad as 9/11. But all over the United States, Sentinels were taking over, for the US Federal Government. People�s rights and liberties were now in their control. 



As for Captain America, he never knew that this day would come and happen: that the US Govt. would target its superhero population. All around him, he could see the dead bodies of Wolverine, Spiderman and Cage.&nbsp; He was going to be the last one left and would fight to his very death, hoping that he would prevent the United States from switching from a democracy to a totalitarian state, which it was becoming.



A Sentinel arm had hit him from behind. He had managed to dodge all the previous attacks against him before, thanks to his military skills and the super soldier serum. Now, he was a goner too. His body falls to the ground. His head hits the floor and his eyes, still conscious, were watching New York burning. His last words, �I hope Black Widow is still out there�.



Pacific Ocean 2008



An island all by itself.&nbsp; There is no one there, except one lone survivor, Black Widow. Her real name was Natalia Alianova Romanova. She was the last descendant of the Romanov Dynasty. A tall beautiful Russian woman with long red hair and a sexy athletic body to go with it.&nbsp; She had defected years ago from Russia, when it had been the Soviet Union. She had defected it for the United States and had joined the Avengers and America�s elite Anti Terrorist Organization S.H.I.E.L.D.



Now, the US was also in a chaotic state, since the days of 9/11. But it wasn�t just the United States. Russia had just gone away from communism but was once more heading away from democracy, and this time, into a dictatorship, under its current President Putin. 



In her special identity code name Black Widow, she wore a dark blue spandex , with gloves and boots of the same colour,&nbsp; and she wore a yellow belt on her waist. She had managed to escape to this island, thanks to a special S.H.I.E.L.D. jet, which had exploded in mid air, but not taking Black Widow with it.



Black Widow looks up in the air. It was a jet, the same one that blew hers up. It had the symbol of Hydra in it. �Shit�, muttered Black Widow. She would have to fight the jet by guerilla warfare.&nbsp; She had a plan.



&nbsp;&nbsp; ***



The Hydra plane landed and its passengers (Hydra troops) were searching for Black Widow.&nbsp; As for our red haired heroine, she was hiding behind some bushes. She was good in camouflage warfare. Being trained in fighting and assassination, she would be able to take these guys and hijack their jet.&nbsp; 



Someone spotted her.&nbsp; Shit. Time to run again. Black Widow ran, as the bullets had sped for her. She kept on running until, she reached the edge of a small cliff. Later did she realize was that the Hydra men were shooting an ice gun towards her, freezing their body, like what Baron Zemo did for Captain America. They wanted her alive, for torture. But by the time, she was frozen by the ice gun, it had fallen by the edge of the cliff.



The frozen body of Natasha Romanova was now below water.&nbsp; As for the Hydra Agents, they wouldn�t have time to collect her body. It appears that the Sentinels were already in control of the Americas by the time, this whole battle was taking place. The Sentinels flew over the Pacific Ocean and was targeting Hydra Jets, soldiers and other terrorist organizations worldwide.&nbsp; Mastermold was the Sky Net of the new world order,&nbsp; although whether he was going to take over the world was a different matter.



Deep down the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean, was the frozen body of Black Widow. This meant that if her body were to ever be found, she would still be the same age, on the day she had been frozen.&nbsp; As for when she would be free from her icy sleep, that was a good speculation.



Pacific Ocean 2099



The frozen body of Black Widow had been discovered by the radars of a submarine.&nbsp; Soon, she would be awake again.



Manila, The Philippines 2099



It was a glorious day again for dictator Aquino Sanchez, a hardcore Meztiza, who had sent the rebels and the freedom fighters under torture and their wives, forced to become prostitutes for the Filipino army.



Her own father before her, was able to come to power, thanks to fallen Skrull technology. While many nations had collapsed over the world wars, he and the army and their scientists were lucky to have a Skrull ship, crash land on some island off the Philippines. The United States, Philippines� Mother Power, was no more, during that time period. 



And no different from Nazi counterparts in the film Philadelphia Experiment II, the Filipino scientists studied the Skrull technology and then used it to further the dictator�s own imperial ambitions across South East Asia. China, India, Japan and Indonesia were all nuked and so, were in no position to attack his country.



The Lab



Black Widow had been de-frozen and was lying inside a glass box, that served as a sarcophagus. 



Black Widow found herself in a new scenario. One moment, she was on the cliff, in the run from Hydra Agents, and the next, she was lying inside a glass box. She banged hard on the glass box she was in. she screamed, �Let me out. You hydra Agents. Let me out�



The Filipino military scientists were looking at their new prisoner banging and making noise. The head scientist Dr Rizal, made a call.



After the call, Aquino Sanchez was interested, that the discovered heroine (whom old data banks show to be none other than the infamous American heroine Black Widow) was finally awakened.



When Aquino had arrived inside the military lab, she was smiling at the struggling heroine. She squat down and knocked on the glass. Natasha looked at the female dictator and said, �Who the hell are you?� Aquino laughed.&nbsp; �Do you know where you are?� , said Aquino. Natasha shook her head, saying, �Let me out. I hate being inside a glass box.� 



Aquino told her men to open the lock to the glass box and let Black Widow out. The moment, the men opened the glass box, Natasha tried leaping off and started exchanging kicks and punches but the Filipino soldiers were too quick for her and managed to knock her down.



When Natasha got conscious again, she found herself on her knees, with her ankles tied together by some strange unbreakable material and her wrists were tied behind her back, by the same type material. She couldn�t escape this one.



Aquino slapped her face. Natasha felt the impact and was angry. �Do you know where you are?�, asked Aquino. Natasha shook her head, �No, I don�t�. Aquino lifted Natasha�s head up, by the chin. Aquino smiled wickedly, �According to our analysis, you were probably frozen in the year 2008. That was also the last year of the United States as world superpower.&nbsp; Your story is just like Captain America�s. Welcome to the year 2099�.



Black Widow�s eyes went wide open.&nbsp; 91 years had passed. This was a different world now. Her head went down in defeat saying, �No, this can�t be happening. As much as she was a tough woman, her mind was becoming slightly dead, like she was in another world. She was never going to see her beloved Captain America again.



While her mind ended up in a funny state, Aquino laughed cruelly. Being dictator, she could decide what to do with Black Widow�s body.&nbsp; This was her body now, to do with as she pleased.



The cuffed body of the Russian redhead was placed on a trolley and the men were taking the body to the trunk of Aquino�s limo. They dumped the body inside and had locked it.&nbsp; The car drove on,&nbsp; until they reached Aquino�s mansion.&nbsp; 



Once the limousine reached the mansion, the chauffeur and her men opened the trunk and carried Black Widow�s shocked body inside the mansion.&nbsp; She was no longer a threat now. It was a simple Mind Game and one Aquino never thought would happen, since she planned on having fun with the heroine while her body and mind were fully aware and fully afraid of the pain.



Aquino was thrilled to see Natasha Romanov�s body being unloaded and brought inside her mansion.&nbsp; 



The body of Black Widow was stripped naked and was laid on top of Aquino�s long wooden table.&nbsp; She was now a table display, like a human sushi plate inside a Japanese restaurant, but she is dead in her mind.



Aquino�s two teenage daughters would have the pleasure of enjoying the body of a former heroine from America, from the early 21st Century, as now their home property.&nbsp; 

As for modifications, only that her boobs were TIED together and making her nipples stand out solid. 



But Aquino was cruel. The boobs were made to stand out but Black Widow�s Romanov Nipples had been severed off.&nbsp; She had nipple-less breasts.&nbsp; Her eyes still looked wide open towards the ceiling.&nbsp; Her red pubic hair had been shaved off completely.&nbsp; Her cunt was now a chop stick holder, since Black Widow was now a human plate.



Sometimes, Aquino has parties and everyone uses chopsticks to pick their food off Natasha�s living but unthinking body. Everyone murmured as how enjoyable it was to dine on the body of a former heroine.



Everyone also laughed at seeing Black Widow�s nipples being GONE.



Although Black Widow could no longer feel physical pain, she still felt emotional and spiritual and mental pain, which was worse than any physical BDSM pain. Each time they put a chopstick back into her cunt, she would remember Steve Rogers entering her.&nbsp; 



That was what kept her eyes flowing with tears sometimes. Partly shut off from the rest of the world, but still alert that her tormentors took delight in her emotional loss, although they weren�t. Aquino would look at tears flowing out and say, 

�Hey our plate can cry�.



Everyone would evilly laughed.&nbsp; This was torment for the untormentable Black Widow
