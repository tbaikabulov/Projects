Hard Time for the Prisoner
Provided By: BDSM Librarywww.bdsmlibrary.com
Synopsis: The dictator was so angry that he had taken everything away from her:  all she owned; her freedom; all contact with the outside world; and even her very identity as a human being.  The manual instructed the guards to call her simply �X�.  Her entire universe now consisted of the harshest prison in Latin America where, as the manual said, �the prisoner will be kept where she shall be forgotten and her life made a hell until old age comes and she eventually dies.�          She was just 23 years old.  She was short with brown skin and black hair.  Oddly, the tortures had developed instead of diminished the muscle tone of her body, what with the stress put on it by the ropes pulling and stretching her limbs and torso into painful positions.  Her legs had slender but feminine curves.  The brown skin of her thighs had a sheen.  Her soft tummy was flat.  But it was a body and a mind that could never again know the companionship of another human being, only hate, hurt, fear, and pain.         This is a story of doom � a life lived without hope; a relentless assault on her humanity; and a daily and never-ending struggle to keep that humanity.  A life were she must expect that every human being she encounters will hurt her, except . . . .

This was my
first day on the job and jobs are hard to come by for people like me.� What a celebration in our family when I was
hired to be a guard in the state prison!�
A paycheck at the end of each month and a pension for my old age!� I began my first day with the greatest
determination not to screw up this, the opportunity of my life.

&nbsp;

The
sergeant gave me general instructions and then told me that because I was so
�reliable� � whatever that meant! � I would be assigned to the detail guarding the
special prisoner.� Then he gave me this
book.� It had a plain cover with an even
plainer title:� Orientation for X.

&nbsp;

* * * *

From Orientation
for X.

&nbsp;

Purpose:� Orientation for new guards of the special
prisoner.

&nbsp;

I.� Introduction

&nbsp;

Objective:�
Total deprivation and control of the special prisoner (codename
�X�).� To set example for other potential
rebels against El Leader.

&nbsp;

Subject:�
Maria Velasquez; age 23; height short 5 ft. 2 inches; weight slim
build.� Religious (Christian)
disposition.� Pacifist.� Parentage 70% Native American; skin tone
brown; hair black.� Only child, both
parents dead.

&nbsp;

Reason
for Special Treatment:� Opposed to El Leader�s narcotics
operations.� Private prayer vigils for
�God�s healing our country�.� She stated
that her activity in her own home does not violate El Leader�s laws because she
only does it while alone.� However, she
has not kept it a secret.� Public
knowledge of and appreciation of this activity was growing in the region.� She refuses to support El Leader.� She refuses to renounce opposition to his
rule.� Even though the region of the
county where her hamlet resides is both small and remote, her reputation in it
has been growing and can be source of future problems.

&nbsp;

Our
Public Position:� Prisoner is religious fanatic and U.S.
Government spy. (Note recent U.S. efforts against drug cartels in our region.)
We will not make her into a martyr.�
Rather, prisoner is being re-educated for her own good and public
safety.� More on public relations aspects
of case in Section VI below.

&nbsp;

The
Truth:� [WARNING:�
THIS PARAGRAPH IS FOR YOUR INFORMATION ONLY.� DO NOT DISCLOSE THIS TO OUTSIDERS UNDER PAID
OF SEVERE PUNISHMENT!]� 

&nbsp;

Prisoner is
simple peasant girl whose shy demeanor, quiet behavior, and good looks have
attracted unwanted attention to her activity from our standpoint.� Expect submissive obedience to your commands
due to her belief system.� No ties to US
can be found and no other political activities are known.� However, she has been known to watch such tv
shows as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel which she says �are
real cool�.� (Note the fighting, the good
vs. evil motif, the general anti-establishment attitude of these shows and most
importantly, their US origin.)� She has
participated enthusiastically in local dance events especially ones where US
rock bands were played.� This
participation has extended to singing karaoke.�
It appears that she is unaware of the effect that this has on young men
of her age and how it enhances her danger to us.� �I only have a few boyfriends. �If I fall in love, I will get married but I
would like to play the field for a little while longer.�� As part of our remedial action plan, all her
friends have been shot.

&nbsp;

Summary:�
Prisoner�s punishment is to be both private and public.� Her inner spirit must be broken; the peasants
of the region must be cowed.� Once these
intermediate goals have been accomplished, the prisoner will be kept where she
shall be forgotten and her life made a hell until old age comes and she
eventually dies.

&nbsp;

* * * *

&nbsp;

So this was
the famous Maria Velasquez!� She really
didn�t look like much.� She stood with
her back to a large post in the ground.�
The post was about 8 feet high and about as wide as a telephone
pole.� Her arms were wrapped around it
and the wrists tied together.� Since her
arms were bare, I noticed that the position was putting a strain on the
muscles.� The upper arm flexed and
rippled as she labored to get a more comfortable position.� Other cords around her ankles, thighs, and
chest bound her body to the post.

&nbsp;

Her face
was a study in agony.� Her hair was
matted on the top of her head.� It was
dark black.� It scraggled down the back
and sides of her head to her neck.� The
other guards sat in the shade fanning themselves in the heat of the Central
American afternoon.� Everybody had
apparently been this position for a long time.�


&nbsp;

�So, we�ve
got a new man!�� I turned to her in
surprise. She looked at me with a crooked grin on her face.

&nbsp;

�Are you
allowed to talk?� I asked.� �Why not,
we�re having such a party!� she answered.

&nbsp;

The head
guard chuckled.� �She is quite a
comic.� Just when you think she�s done up
good, she gives us a joke.� Such a
jokester!�� He got up, took my papers
from my hand, grinned at me, then turned and slapped the prisoner�s face.� She moaned and rocked her head from side to
side.� He turned back to me and said,
�Welcome to the detail.�

&nbsp;

This
situation was certainly not what I expected.�
All I want is a paycheck.� I
reflected that humor can see one through the greatest adversity but that
presupposes that there is another side to the valley, that the phrase �getting
through� means that there is an end to get through to.� What if the adversity in one�s life will
never have an end, that it will become as in the words of the manual, �the
prisoner will be kept where she shall be forgotten and her life made a hell
until old age comes and she eventually dies?�

&nbsp;

I believe
that this is when the thought of murder first entered my mind.

From Orientation
for X.

&nbsp;

II.� General Rules

&nbsp;

Identity:�
Prisoner to be stripped of all sense of self.� She shall be addressed at all times as� �X� and referred to as �The Prisoner�.� The term �Prisoner X� is prohibited as that
implies other prisoners in the system and hence kindred spirits.� Guards� behavior shall emphasize that she is
all alone and shall always remain so.

&nbsp;

The
Outside:� Under no circumstances shall she receive any
information of anything going on in the outside world.� Her entire universe shall consist of you the
guards, her bondage, and her suffering.�
Guards shall not even speak among themselves within her hearing except
for necessary matters relating to the prisoner and her punishment.

&nbsp;

Time:�
Wake-up, bed-down, and other necessary items of the day shall be varied
so that the prisoner may have no frame of reference.� No watches or calendars may be displayed
within the prisoner�s sight.� Guards must
never let the prisoner know the time or the day or the year.� The prisoner shall exist in a timeless fog of
endless suffering.

&nbsp;

Privacy:�
None.� At least three guards shall
be with the Prisoner at all times when she is out of her cell pit.� The number shall impress upon the prisoner
that she is absolutely under our control.

&nbsp;

Attire:��
To facilitate handling procedures, normal daily clothing shall be
minimal.� No hat for head and feet kept
bare.� Prisoner shall wear shorts
extending from lower belly at their top to the upper thigh at the bottom.� Since prisoner�s breasts are small, she shall
wear the fitted cloth strap across them.�
Guards should make sure that strap is firmly secured in back as garment
has no shoulder straps to hold it up.�
Other attire may be assigned for punishment and other special
purposes.� At no time shall the prisoner
be allowed any input as to dress or the bondage she shall wear.

&nbsp;

Bondage:�
The prisoner�s arms and legs shall be shackled at all times except for
exercise periods and other occasions specifically designated.� Prescribed length of chains for ankles is 12
inches to allow minimal movement by prisoner.�
When unshackling a limb observe the following procedures:

&nbsp;

����������� 1)�
arms.� With one hand grasp the
prisoner�s inside muscle of the upper arm firmly just below the shoulder.� Wrap your other hand around the outside wrist
just above the handcuff.� Squeeze but not
so hard so as to prevent blood circulation.�
Another guard then shall remove the cuff from the prisoner�s wrist.� That guard positions the arms to a new
position.� While this is in process, the
prisoner is to have no freedom of movement.�
Do not allow the prisoner to guide you to the new position; you guide
her.� Only after the cuffs are placed
back onto the wrist may the arm be released.

&nbsp;

����������� 2)�
legs.� This will require three men
for each leg.� The prisoner will normally
be seated or laid down for this procedure.�
One guard will wrap both arms around the prisoner�s thigh and will
squeeze firmly.� The second guard will
wrap both hands around the prisoner�s ankle and also squeeze.� Then the third guard may unlock the
cuff.� 

&nbsp;

����������� 3)�
both.� Prisoner must be
blindfolded.� A guard should stand behind
prisoner and place arm around prisoner�s throat. Press forearm to front of
throat so that back of prisoner�s neck is pressed against guard�s chest.�� Give prisoner detailed orders for what
specific acts are required of her once released.� Have her repeat those orders to you.� Only when she has exactly proved her understanding
of her orders may the cuffs be removed from her arms and legs.

&nbsp;

Since
prisoner may tend to sweat in the hot days in our latitude, the guard may wish
to dry prisoner�s thighs and upper arms with a towel before gripping them with
his hands.

&nbsp;

Note that
releasing prisoner even partially from her shackles may undermine our regime of
absolute control over her.� These actions
emphasize to her that no minute and no part of her life is her own.

&nbsp;

Movement:�
For normal movement between prison areas, prisoner shall be
blindfolded.� She must have no sense of
space as well as time.� Each area of the
prison she is exposed to shall be an entire universe to her with no sense of
relation to anywhere else.� A guard shall
stand on each side of prisoner.� Each
guard shall firmly grasp prisoner�s upper arm with both hands.� One hand shall grasp inside of prisoner�s arm
while the other hand grasps the outside of the arm.�� March prisoner to destination.

&nbsp;

* * * *

&nbsp;

I stood
watching X staked in the sun, with her arms tied together behind the post.� Her head was still reeling from the
blow.� It rocked from side to side with a
soft moan.

&nbsp;

I noticed a
drop of sweat come down the side of her face.�
It curved down the front of her ear and then ran down her neck.� The neck was so thin!� It ran down to her collarbone.� Because her shoulders were pulled down by the
ropes, the drop went out to the front of her arm.� It stopped at the band of ropes that tied her
body above her breasts and around her upper arms.� Other drops of sweat joined it until it was
too big a drop to be held by the cord.�
It fell over the cord and ran down her side.� Her body was wet from the perspiration so the
drop glided straight down.� The chest was
heaving from her suffering.� Her little
tummy was soft and glistened in the sun.�
The drop fell over the stomach rope and disappeared into her
shorts.� I imagined it going down her
lower area and then starting down her leg.�
A drop emerged from her shorts just inside her thigh.� It followed the curve of her leg;� the cord binding her legs just above her
knees was now no obstacle to it.� The
drop leaped over it and slid around her knee to the inside of the bone on the
front of her lower leg.� It followed that
around the large muscle and landed on her foot.�
It stayed there for a moment, and then ran down the side and into the
dirt.

&nbsp;

III.� Daily Routine - Wake-up:� Send wake-up signal to prisoner�s sleep helmet.� (The sleep helmet monitors the prisoner�s
brain waves.� This device has two
purposes:� 1) psychological, the prisoner
has absolutely no privacy even in sleep, and 2) security, any escape will break
the signal that the helmet sends to control.)

&nbsp;

Look down
into pit.� Prisoner will be inside
it.� Tell prisoner to stand with hands
raised above head in surrender mode.�
Note that previous shift has left prisoner in the prescribed
sleepwear.� (White sack dress to make her
more visible in dim light.� Dress should
leave arms visible below lower half of shoulder muscle, cleavage three inches
below neck, and hem just above knee.)�
Observe that her feet are bare and placed together with hobbles on, that
the helmet has been placed at the foot of her cot, that she stands without
slouching, and that her arms are fully erect and vertical with hands apart and
extended to the full 8 inches that the sleep shackles on them allow.� Lower the hook into the pit.� Tell the prisoner to put the wrist chain over
the hook.� Then raise her.

&nbsp;

Lower
prisoner onto platform above her cell pit.�
Unshackle prisoner�s arms and legs.�
(See General Procedure II-Bondage-3 above.)�� Direct prisoner to remove her dress and
stand naked.� These procedures result in
pain in the hoist up and the humiliation of stripping and standing naked within
minutes of having wakened.� 

&nbsp;

* * * *

&nbsp;

It was only
a dream!� I was a little girl again.� Papa and I were on the side of the hill above
our village.� The breeze was just right.� The kite was so high; it was many feet above
the ground!� Then Papa turned to me and
held the string out to me.� �Here, you
can take it now,� he said.� His face was
beaming.� I took the string and ran and
ran and ran.� Then I woke up.

&nbsp;

I have a
headache.� I always wake up with a
headache.� There�s this awful thing I
must wear on my head.� Now that I am
awake, I must take it off.� I stand and
raise my hands.� My bare feet ache on the
cold cement.� All around me is
cement.� I have on only a slip.� I have had no clothing over my arms or legs
for such a long, long time.� Well, my
slip does go down to my knees.� But under
that, nothing.� Everything I wear is so
drab and small.

&nbsp;

I cry.� I can�t help myself.� I know I�m a big girl now.� I shouldn�t cry but I do.� I can barely look up to see the hook coming
down.� It�s all just so awful!� I can�t stop crying.� O, God!�
What have I done?� Whatever it
was, it must have been something really bad!�
I know it wasn�t praying.� That�s
good, isn�t it?� It couldn�t my being a
rebel against El Leader.� How could it
be?� I didn�t do anything!� What was it I did?� I must be a really bad person to have a life
like this.� I�m sorry, I�m so very sorry
� whatever it was I did.

&nbsp;

I imagine
that somewhere in the universe there is a book that records all of my
thoughts.� I can�t write; I�m not allowed
to.� Not really.� That stupid stuff they make me write before
they send me to this pit doesn�t count.�
Somewhere out there is my invisible book where I can write my invisible
thoughts.

&nbsp;

In the
meantime the hook has arrived and the guards are yelling at me.� I must concentrate on putting my chain over
the hook and not cry at my helplessness as they raise me up.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

III.� Daily Routine - Morning Prep:� In line with General Health Procedures
described below, prisoner shall commence toiletries including brushing teeth
and combing hair.� Medical Adjutant (MA)
shall check prisoner and direct further actions by her at this point.� MA shall perform the day�s first tests of
blood pressure and other vital signs.�
Since prisoner is in unshackled state, guards shall grab hold of her
wrists stretching her arms out in the crucifix position while medical tests are
performed.� When MA concludes tests,
guards may delay a few minutes before presenting her with her day�s underwear,
shorts and top to let her humiliation sink in.

&nbsp;

Egress
from Sleep Area:� Once clothed, order prisoner to extend hands
to receive cuffs.� Prisoner must face
guard and extend her arms directly in front of her with no bending of elbows.� Hold cuffs directly in front of her face and
order her to look at them.� This daily
ritual shall impress on her mind that her life is in bondage to the state.� She shall stand there with her arms extended
until she looks strait at the cuffs and says, �I accept these chains as the
just punishment of the state.�� You then
put the cuffs on the wrists, tighten them to the acceptable degree and allow
her to lower her arms.� Cuff� her ankles.

&nbsp;

Present her
specially fitted blindfold.� It�s 1 inch
wide thin design allows maximum exposure of the face (lack of privacy
again).� Hold blindfold under the prisoner�s
nose and make her gaze at it.� Then look
directly at her.� Get in her face to
emphasize the point.� Announce that you
will now take away her sight.� Put the
blindfold on top of her head.� Slowly
lower it.� Adjust the plastic nose guard
to prevent sight from the bottom of the eyes.�
Do not adjust elastic band at the back of her skull.� It is especially fitted so as to prevent
excessive headaches from too much pressure while preventing eyesight from
slippage.

&nbsp;

Stand
stretcher behind prisoner.� Order prisoner
to step directly backwards until head, back, but, and legs are directly
touching stretcher.� Strap her in.� Buckle strap about her shoulders and upper
chest.� Buckle strap just below her
breasts.� Buckle strap about her
hips.� Buckle strap above her lower
thighs just above her knees.� Buckle
strap about her ankles.� Place plugs in
her ears.

&nbsp;

Lower
stretcher to floor.� Lift it up and carry
her out of the dungeon.

&nbsp;

Great care
must be taken not to let the prisoner have any sensation of going up or out.� At night she is walked down the flights of
stairs to impress upon her that for her everything is down.� Her cell is in a pit deep below ground.� Even though logically she must realize that
to get back out she must have to be taken up, that thought must not be
reinforced by any additional sensory input.�
As far as she can tell, she is strapped to the stretcher and then
unstrapped outside of the building.

&nbsp;

Breakfast:�
Once outside building set end of stretcher with prisoner�s head against
wall so that body is at 45 degree angle to ground.� Remove earplugs.� Inform prisoner that you shall now feed her
breakfast.� The meal will be found on the
table next to her.� 

&nbsp;

Prisoner is
aware that failure to eat and drink will result in MA forcing her to do so.

&nbsp;

Before
allowing her any sip of liquid or morsel of food you will order her to open her
mouth.� It is usually best to begin with
liquids (usually water).� 

&nbsp;

Touch glass
to her lips.� Order prisoner to
drink.� For liquids, prisoner shall use
her lips to move glass to position where she can transfer sip to mouth.� She shall hold liquid and food items in mouth
until you order to swallow.� 

&nbsp;

Touch food
item to her lips.� Order prisoner to
eat.� Prisoner will use lips and teeth to
take food from fork or spook and chew.�
Order her to swallow.

&nbsp;

She is not
allowed to swallow until she is ordered to do so.� Vary the length of time that she must have
water or food at her lips or in her mouth to emphasize to her the extent her
life is now totally controlled by us.

&nbsp;

* * * *

&nbsp;

I�ve been
thinking a lot of the times when I was a little girl and Mama and Papa were
still alive.� I would wake up and bounce
out of bed.� Since our house had only one
room, I could see Mama cooking.� There
was a steaming bowl of cereal on my place on the table.� I scamper to my chair.� At his place at the table sat Papa smiling at
me.� I dived into the cereal.� I was vaguely aware that we were poor but I
never noticed.� Mama always put berries
and sugar and a surprise � something else really, really good � in it.� Many times I ate really fast because when I
see the sunbeam (only one, we had only one window) when the sunbeam was on the
floor just 2 feet beyond Papa, I could hear the other children outside.� Mama said, �Now Maria you must not leave until
you eat it all, the bread, too.�� So I
would gobble it all up and bounce up and down in my chair.�� Papa, would smile and say to Mama, �okay
Theo� (her name was Theodora), �I think we can let her go now.�� And I would jump up and go outside to play.

&nbsp;

III.� Daily Routine - Exercise Period:� In line with health goals, prisoner shall be
exercised to maintain heart, lungs, basic muscle tone, and general health.� The procedures also emphasize our control
over her life and her submission to it.

&nbsp;

Remove
breakfast items from vicinity, then remove buckles from stretcher.� Remove blindfold.� Order prisoner to stand.� Allow prisoner her first 15 minute �free
period� for mental and physical health reasons.�
(See Health Section below.)�
During this period prisoner is allowed to stretch and relieve herself in
nearby toilet facility but is not allowed to leave immediate area.� Prisoner commonly will spend some of this
time in some kind of Catholic prayer devotional.� While the state discourages this kind of
activity, no amount of torture in the past has prevented the prisoner from
doing this, so we now allow her do so.�
However, she must enter the cage (see Cage Section below),� because this is the only place where she is
allowed to pray.

&nbsp;

When her
time is up, unlock the cage and order prisoner out.� March her to the exercise area.� Remember to use standard prisoner transport
procedures (see General Section above).�
This means blindfold and guard�s arm grips.� MA will examine prisoner on arrival at
exercise area.� Remove blindfold.� For each exercise remove shackles from hands
and feet as necessary.� MA will supervise
all exercise activities.

&nbsp;

a) Jumping Jacks.�
She must extend arms and legs to furthest possible.� When she jumps to outward, feet must land as
far apart as possible.� Hands must touch
at top of arm�s arc.� When she jumps to
inward, feet much touch and hands must be against her sides.� Exercise shall be performed at the rapid rate
prescribed by MA.� Guard shall stand
behind prisoner and whip her for each failure or infraction. 

&nbsp;

b) Sit-ups.�
Prisoner shall sit on ground with wrists crossed behind head.� Cuff them.�
She must keep hands in that position throughout the exercise.� Lock prisoner�s feet in stocks.� Push prisoner down to the ground to make her
lay down with knees bent and up in air.���
Order her to sit up and touch elbows to knees.� Prisoner finds this exercise difficult and
painful so keep it short.� Remember that
these exercises are only to keep prisoner healthy and strong enough to endure
her captivity, not to get her strong enough so that she gets ideas of self
esteem.

&nbsp;

c) Treadmill.�
Prisoner shall walk until ordered to stop.� MA will adjust speed from slow walk to fast
sprint.� Guards will beat prisoner each
time she falls off.� At conclusion of
this activity, prisoner will be winded and sweating heavily.� Give prisoner towel to dry herself and water
to drink.� Prisoner is not allowed to sit
or kneel down.

&nbsp;

d)� Push-ups.� Prisoner must keep back and legs straight
throughout exercise.� When down, nose
must touch ground; when up, arms must be fully extended with no bending elbows.

&nbsp;

����������� e)�
Cool Down.� Shackle legs
and cuff her hands behind her back.�
Blindfold her.� Order prisoner to
walk around the area in that condition.�
Prisoner has great fear of falling due to the many times guards have
tripped her or caused her to run into things.�
While the ground in this area is sandy, you should still be careful of
injuring her.

&nbsp;

* * * *

&nbsp;

Yesterday
we forced X to stand up.� -- How odd that
after only a few weeks of working here, even I have come to think of her as
�X�!�� At the end of her push-ups, X is
gasping for air and hardly able to stand.�
Tension on her legs and arms shows that she is aching throughout her
body. 

&nbsp;

The
Orientation Book�s description of the Exercise Period makes it sound like
something from a high school gym class.�
In reality it is an opportunity for brutal torment.� 

&nbsp;

�Time for
cool down,� the head guard said.� While I
put the chain on her ankles, other guards held her arms behind her back and put
on the handcuffs.� Then I took her
blindfold.� She knew what was going to
happen next.� She stood there
groaning.� She begged me with her eyes to
help her, while knowing that I could not.�
The expression on my face told her that.�
She nodded in acceptance.� I
lowered the blindfold over her head, placed it over her eyes, and adjusted the
nose guard.� While doing so, I touched
her face.� Her cheek was damp and hot.� I resisted the urge to wipe it with a
towel.� I knew what the other guards
would do.

&nbsp;

�Does this
mean that I can lay down now and go to sleep?� she asked.� �Jokester,� the head man said and zapped her
with his electric tazer in the back of her leg, behind the knee.� She yelped and fell down.� The guards laughed and picked her up.� �Stand up!� we yelled at her as she struggled
to regain her balance.� Then we walked
her.

&nbsp;

She
staggered forward, trying to keep her balance.�
Even with her blindfold on, her terror clearly showed on her face.� �Ahh� came from her mouth, quite
involuntarily.� It wasn�t quite a scream
but more than a moan, more like a continual wail.� One guard lashed her with a leather strap on
her back.� �Quiet!� he demanded.� �Glup, Glup,� she wailed as she her conscious
mind tried to stop making noise while her fear insisted on continuing.� More beating was unable to resolve the
struggle and in the end the struggle of mind versus fear was a draw.� Her body collapsed onto the ground.

&nbsp;

�Let�s give
her the �Run Around��, the head guard said.�
The other guards grinned.� One
picked her up.� She is small, so it
wasn�t much effort.� We formed a
circle.� He pushed her to me.� Blind, hobbled, and exhausted, she went
forward but immediately started to fall.�
I caught her before she could do so.�
With my two hands around her torso, I spun her around and pushed her to
the next man.� He then did the same.� We threw her in random directions.� She was continually falling.� Even if she had been fresh, she would still
have been unable to regain her balance because she was always caught, spun, and
then pushed/thrown before she could do anything.

&nbsp;

Between the
challenge of catching her, spinning her round and round, and groping her body I
actually had fun despite myself.� And I
could not find any opportunity in the daily routine so far for the murder.

III.� Daily Routine - Exercise Period:� At conclusion of exercise period, take
prisoner back to the cage.� MA to examine
her.

&nbsp;

The Cage:�
This is the holding pen for the prisoner while punishments and other
activities are being prepared.� It�s
dimensions are 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 � feet high.� This means that the prisoner is able to lay
down with 10 inches to spare and stand with 3 inches to spare.� It hangs from a cable; it�s floor is 6 inches
off the ground.� Space between bars is 3
inches.� Inside is a chamber pot for
prisoner�s toilet needs.

&nbsp;

Before
placing prisoner in cage MA will perform medical examination.� Make prisoner drink water to ensure that she
is fully hydrated.� Unless prisoner is
being rewarded, her hands and feet must be shackled while inside cage.� If prisoner�s hands are behind back, move
them to front.

&nbsp;

Open door
of cage and order prisoner to walk into it.�
Then close and lock the door.�
Cage is located in nook of prison grounds where walls limit prisoner�s
visibility to immediate area.�� Once in
cage, guards should not speak.� Should
prisoner�s emotional distress become extreme, summon MA.

&nbsp;

Also inside
the cage are a Bible and a small plastic rosary (a Catholic prayer
gadget).� These are included for the
prisoner�s mental health.� These are the
only personal items that the prisoner is allowed to have.� She is only allowed to have them inside the
cage.

&nbsp;

Prisoner
receives lunch and dinner in the cage.�
Watch closely to make sure all food is eaten and water drunk.

&nbsp;

* * * *

&nbsp;

I like my
cage.� This surprises me.� The guards usually leave me alone while I am
in my cage.� Sometimes they poke me with
sticks through the bars but since things are worse everywhere else, I accept
this.

&nbsp;

The bars
define a space.� It�s kind of my space,
the space behind the bars.� Nobody else
goes behind the bars but me.� In my space
is a bowl.� This is my toilet.� Sometimes they put water and food in my
space.� And finally in my space are my
things.� There is a rosary and there is a
Bible.� They weren�t my things before my
arrest.� But they are now.� 

When they
poke me with sticks, those sticks are invaders, aliens from another space, aliens
from outside.� The sticks hurt, the alien
sticks, the invaders from the outside into my space.

&nbsp;

My
things.� My space.� There�s still a piece of the world that is
mine.� My space.� My things.�
My body.� My soul.

&nbsp;

I pray the
rosary.� The touch of the beads reminds
me of my existence.� I can pray without
the beads but the touch of them makes me remember that they�re my beads.� My things in my space.

&nbsp;

When my
eyes are blinded, and my ears are plugged, and my hands tied so long that they
grow numb, I remember the feel of the beads and the sight of the Bible.� And I�m reminded that there�s a God, my
God.� That invisible book where my
thoughts send these invisible words may not be real but I know God is.� Everybody has a friend in Jesus and that
includes me, too.� I�m still a person.

&nbsp;

III.� Daily Routine - Daily Tribunal:� This function holds prisoner accountable on a
daily basis for her conduct.

&nbsp;

Inform
prisoner that she shall now be taken to the Tribunal.� Throw water on her and generally clean her
up.� Present her with her court
dress.� This consists of one-piece grey
canvas dress that is sleeveless and hemmed just above knee.� After you have pulled dress down over head,
make sure the dress� straps are buttoned on top of shoulders.� Place blindfold over her eyes.

&nbsp;

March prisoner
to Administration Building.� Two guards
shall stand on each side firmly holding her upper arms with both hands.

&nbsp;

Once inside
the courtroom, remove blindfold.� March
her to the concrete pad that is marked the defendant�s place.� Lighting will be very dim so wait to adjust
your eyes.� Allow prisoner to sit in wood
chair while waiting for judges.� (Judges
will usually consist of prison administration staff.)

&nbsp;

Bailiff
will turn lights on, announce arrival of judges, and command, �all rise.�� Make prisoner stand.� When the judges are seated make prisoner
kneel.� Since prisoner will remain
kneeling throughout the Tribunal, strap her ankles together.

&nbsp;

Judges will
take testimony from guards and question prisoner about her conduct during the
past 24 hours.� Prisoner must look at
each Judge as he asks questions or makes comments.� Guards shall beat prisoner for each failure
to do so, as well for the following infractions:

&nbsp;

�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
each
time she speaks when not directly answering a question put to her;

�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
giving
a non-responsive answer to a direct question;

�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
failure
to maintain erect posture;

�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
non-respectful
demeanor;

�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
emotional
behavior.

&nbsp;

Administer
beating immediately upon each infraction.�
Use heavy leather strap upon your choice of bottom of prisoner�s feet,
back of her legs, or arms as these areas of her body are bare and exposed.� Do not beat face because we do not want face
marked when we exhibit her in public.� If
the prisoner gets dizzy or starts to sway back and forth, dump a bucket of cold
water onto her head.� Since she has
nothing to hold onto, guards may have to hold her up themselves.� Be sure to keep her in the kneeling position
and turning her face to each speaker with eyes open.

&nbsp;

Each
session the prisoner will be asked to recant her religious activities and
confess that she is a spy.� As always the
prisoner must respond.� She always
answers in the negative.� This is an
incorrect response.� Beat her again for
that.

&nbsp;

Judges
shall then decide prisoner�s punishment for the day.� These will range from mild to severe.� Prisoner usually breaks down and cries around
the time judgment is pronounced.� Allow
her to do that.

&nbsp;

Remove
strap from ankles but leave chain on.�
When Bailiff cries, �all rise!� order her to stand up and make her do
so.� March her to courtroom
entrance.� Blindfold her and march her to
the cage.� Care must be taken to hold her
upper arms as per standard procedure as by this time prisoner is usually in a greatly
agitated state.� She may also suffer from
a spell of depression.� These mental
conditions may result in her not submitting to your orders.� Taunt her for abandoning her belief system.

&nbsp;

* * * *

&nbsp;

We took X
to the courtroom.� It was dark.� Removing the blindfold from X�s eyes caused
little of the blinking that eyes normally do to adjust from darkness to
light.� We marched her to her place.� I pointed to the small wooden chair.� She quietly sat with her head slightly bent
down, and waited.� Her hands, with her
wrists crossed together by the tight bolts of the iron cuffs, rested on her
lap.� The economy of her motions left her
chains no opportunity to make sound.� The
quiet of the act compared to the usual rattling of her transport chains was
memorable to me.� The expression on her
face was one of resignation to her fate.

&nbsp;

When the
judges entered, she stood in that same quiet, resigned way.� When they sat behind the large bench, she
kneeled on the concrete floor.� I
strapped her ankles together.� Her head
now had to look up at the judges but her face held that same impassive
poise.� To me she looked like a young,
vulnerable girl, not the monster depicted by the state�s propaganda.� The judges, the prosecutor, and the guards
regarded her with unconcealed hate.� She
was alone.� Everybody was together but
she was alone.� The outline of the murder
began to focus in my mind.

&nbsp;

When a
judge asked her a question, the veneer of her poise began to break.� The jaw quivered, she hesitated.� �Answer the question,� the judge snapped.� She answered the question.� The chief judge totaled up the infractions of
the previous day.� There were five of
them.� Five!� The judges glared at her.� X lowered her head.� A guard grabbed her hair and raised her head
back up to the proper position.

&nbsp;

Then the
court took up the results of last evening�s writing exercise.� �You were specifically directed to write of
your sex life,� a judge thundered. �Yes, sir,� she answered.

&nbsp;

�You told
us nothing at all.� 

&nbsp;

�I am a
virgin.�

&nbsp;

�All you
talk of in here,� the judge waved X�s papers, �is about is your relationships
with boys.�

&nbsp;

�I had
boyfriends.�

&nbsp;

�Do you
mean to tell us that you�ve never had so much as a sexual fantasy with anybody,
ever?�

&nbsp;

�No,
Sir.� I mean yes, Sir I have.�

&nbsp;

�Then with
who?�

&nbsp;

��With him.��
She turned her face to me.�

III.� Daily Routine - Daily Punishment:� The procedures for prisoner�s daily
punishments will vary according to the punishments handed down by the day�s
tribunal.� Guards should remember that
punishments are intended to cause torment and pain but no harm.� This means no broken or torn bones or ligaments,
minimal bruising, no dangerous impairments to blood circulation or breathing.

&nbsp;

The
tribunal has a wide menu of punishments to choose from.� They vary so much that only a few can be
discussed here.� These punishments are
for regular misbehaviors.� Special
Punishments are for exceptional circumstances and are described in a special
section below.� (Section V.)

&nbsp;

* * * *

&nbsp;

I don�t
know why I had told the judges what I did about that guard.� I was tired.�
Of all the people that are now in my life, the judges, the MA�s and the
guards, this one guard seems like a decent person.� At least he looks at me like he somehow has
feelings like he�s still a human being.�
I need to see a human being.� What
would it be like to be married with a husband and a family?� This man could be husband material.� So I said what I said to that judge.

&nbsp;

Afterwards,
they came up with the most unusual punishment yet.� They dragged me out of my cage and made me
stand.� Then they uncuffed my hands and
made me cross my wrists behind my back.�
They tied them together with thin twine.�
They removed the chains from my legs and substituted twine.� This was a special kind of twine.� It reminded me of fishing line.� I could feel it on my ankles but when I
looked down could hardly see it.� I had
the same amount of restraint on my walking as I had before but now the ties
made no sound and were nearly invisible.

&nbsp;

Then they
pulled a cotton dress over me.� It was
all black.� Since my arms were tied together
under the dress, they tucked the sleeves in.�
Then they brought me a nun�s whimper.�
This is the white thing they put on about their heads.� Before they put it over me and arranged the
veil down my back, they plugged my ears so I couldn�t hear anything.� The veal was black, too.� White fabric acted as a collar around my
neck.� Other hard fabric blocked the
sides of my face and a heavy band circled my forehead.� My face was framed by the nun�s whimper.� As a final touch, they put a pair of dark
glasses over my eyes.� These weren�t
ordinary glasses for blocking out the sun.�
Their insides had been painted so that I couldn�t see.

&nbsp;

They
stuffed me into a van and tied me down.�
I felt straps over my shoulders and my stomach.� My back was tied to the side of the van.� They strapped my ankles together and tied
them down to a hook in the floor.� I felt
guards seated on each side of me.

&nbsp;

Some time
went by.� At length the van stopped.� They unstrapped me and pushed me
outside.� The guards on each side of me
made me stand up.� They removed the
glasses from my eyes.

&nbsp;

We were
standing on a busy street in the capital city.�
I could see the traffic and the people walking but I couldn�t hear
anything.� I felt a thrill as finally I
saw something normal.� There was a couple
about my age walking down the sidewalk on the other side of the street.� How I wished I could be the girl on the boy�s
arm!� Then I felt such great sadness as I
realized that I would never again experience anything like that.� My arms were tied behind my back, my legs
were hobbled so that I could only walk slowly, and my ears were plugged so that
I couldn�t hear anything.� I was a
prisoner and everybody else in sight was not.�
I had been sentenced for life.

&nbsp;

They made
me walk down the street and around the corner.�
The nice guard was dressed in regular street clothes.� I supposed this was to mock me.� I fought back my tears.

&nbsp;

Around the
corner was a small sidewalk caf�.� The
nice guard and I sat down at a table.�
The guard ordered.� I couldn�t
hear what the waiter and the guard said.�
In a few minutes drinks and a snack were placed on the table.� The guard had a sorry expression on his
face.� Maybe they were making him go
through this, too.� He didn�t seem to
enjoy this.� He spoke something to me; I
have no idea what it was.� He nervously
drank from his glass.� With my arms tied,
I couldn�t do anything.

&nbsp;

I was in
the middle of all of these people.� They
looked at me with shocked and scandalous expressions.� I guess they thought that I was a nun who was
fooling around.� I knew I must not say
anything.� That is one of the prison�s
firmest rules for me:� I must not speak
to anybody outside of the prison or I would be severely punished.� These punishments can be really bad.� I will do anything (almost) to avoid
them.� So I didn�t say anything.

&nbsp;

All of
these people lived normal lives but I could never again be one of them.� I felt like I was a ghost.� I was there; I was even noticed but I could
never be a part of the scene.� My arms
were tied behind me.� My ears were
plugged so that I could not hear.� My
legs were hobbled.� With the nun�s habit
arranged around my face, even my peripheral vision was taken away from me.� And the people around me knew nothing about
any of this.� I could never know them and
they could never know me.� The only human
reaction I would ever be allowed to receive from them was their deep
disapproval.

&nbsp;

I felt so
very bad and so very sad.� This was also
torture and it hurt even more than usual.

&nbsp;

* * * *

&nbsp;

On another
day X was sentenced to the puppet machine.�
When the judges pronounced her sentence, she tried to maintain a brave
expression but the slight tremble of her shoulders and her quivering jaw
betrayed her.� She stared at the judge as
the regulations required but her eyes were wide despite her efforts.� She bent her head downwards and a small tear
rolled out the side of one eye.

&nbsp;

I
unstrapped her ankles.� Two other guards
grabbed her arms and helped her up.� We
blindfolded her and marched her to the cage.�
When we received the word that the machine was ready, we took her out of
the cage, blindfolded her again, and marched her to the punishment area.

&nbsp;

We took the
blindfold off her.� She took one look at
the machine and collapsed to her knees.�
�Oh, no!� She said.

&nbsp;

Despite
myself, I couldn�t help thinking what an ingenious device this machine
was.� It consisted of a flat system of
beams, wires, and pulleys.� Pilings held
it ten feet high.� Four ropes hung from
it.

&nbsp;

We dragged
her under the machine.� The operator
lowered the ropes.� We attached the
special cuffs to her wrists and ankles.�
These cuffs needed to be soft and wide with sheep hair inside so as to
not damage X when operations began.� We
ordered her to raise her hands.� We
clipped the cuff on her left wrist to one of the ropes. We clipped the cuff on
her right wrist to another rope.� Then we
took her regular handcuffs off.� After
attaching the other two ropes to her legs, we took off her leg chains.� The head guard asked her, �how do you like
this now, X?�� She said, �If I say �it�s
okay�, will my nose grow?�� I noticed
that though X tried to smile her fear and sadness prevented it.� She tried to mask her emotions but she failed
to do that, too.

&nbsp;

�You want
to make like Pinocchio?� the head guard said.�
�Let�s make you like Pinocchio.�

&nbsp;

He waved to
the operator.� He pressed some buttons,
moved some levers and the rope attached to X�s right leg started to
retract.� With a yelp, X stared at her
leg as it came off the ground and upwards in front of her. �She stood there for a moment on her remaining
leg.� The operator did his thing with the
controls and presently the other leg was dragged out from under her, too.� She hung there for a minute by her arms, with
her back bent towards the ground and her knees in front of her eyes.� Then the operator slowly raised her legs and
lowered her arms until she hung by her ankles with her hands just inches above
the ground.� She stretched but her
fingers but she just could not get them to the ground.

&nbsp;

As her
blood gradually flowed down to her brain, her face showed her agony.

&nbsp;

The
operator reversed the ropes.� He slowly
lowered her legs and raised her arms.�
Presently, X was again hanging by her arms.� The next half hour was spent in raising and
lowering arms and legs so that she was either hanging by her arms or upside
down by her legs.� X was trying to be
brave but the strain on her body left her softly moaning.

&nbsp;

Now that
X�s strength has been weakened, it was time to begin the cartwheel.� While hanging by her arms, one of her arms
was lowered.� She was left hanging by
just one arm.� The pressure on her arm�s
joints caused pain to shoot down in it.�
She groaned.� At the same time one
of her legs was raised.� Presently, she
hung by that one arm and the leg.� Then
the arm was lowered.� She hung by just
the one leg.� That one leg had to hold
the entire weight of the rest of her body.�
She groaned and her head turned from side to side.� The operator raised the other leg.� Now she hung upside down by her legs.� The leg was lowered and the other arm was
raised.� Now she hung by the one arm (the
other one this time).� The other leg was
raised.� This process slowly turned her
around and around as if she was on a wheel.

&nbsp;

Her worst
suffering was the brutal pressure on an arm or a leg when she hung by just that
one limb.� Each time the operator paused
the operation.� Sometimes X would raise
her other arm or leg in some desperate attempt to distribute her body weight
over two limbs but since the rope to that limb was slack, she found no
relief.� At length, the operator raised
the next arm or leg in the lineup.

&nbsp;

An hour
into the torture X fainted for the first time.�
We threw water on her face and continued her punishment.

&nbsp;

She swung
when we started pushing her body.� Since
all she wore was her shorts and her breast strap that meant that we mostly
touched her skin.� I was startled when I
first pressed my hands against her hip and her thigh to push her.� Her flesh felt warm.� I was reminded that this was a person and not
just a toy.� That surprised me.� It especially surprised me that I realized
that I had been forgetting that.� I
wondered what she would have been like if none of this had ever happened.

III.� Daily Routine - The Water Chamber:� After the exertions of the exercise and the
punishment periods the prisoner�s hygiene needs shall be met by dunking her in
the chamber.� The chamber is a vessel
filled with water.� It is 4 feet high and
2 feet in radius. After marching prisoner into the chamber area, remove her
blindfold, her shorts, and her breast band.�
Reshackle prisoner�s legs.� Secure
prisoner�s arms behind her back.� Use
brush to soap prisoner�s body.� Make her
ascend steps to top of chamber.� When she
reaches the platform at the top, push her in.�
During the cleaning process, guards may dunk her face under the
water.� When finished, pull prisoner out,
clothe and blindfold her, and return her to her cage.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The
excursion to the capital had been especially cruel.� I could see it in the eyes and the face of
X.� It reminded me that this was Maria
Velasquez, that she was now 24 year old, and that she liked to sing and dance.

&nbsp;

I couldn�t
help but look at her body as she was being prepared for the chamber.� She had been stripped naked.� The guards were cuffing her arms behind her
back.� The chains had already been put
back on her legs.� Her face looked so
tired and sad.� Her body was barely able
to hold her up with the punishments and the stress it had received during the
day so far.

&nbsp;

I had noted
before that Maria was beautiful.� Her
body was thin and short.� Now I decided
it was particularly hot.� Even now, at
her worst time of the day, one could not help but notice the spirit and
personality that was a part of it and her.�
This was a good person.� I knew
that if she was to have ever to fallen in love, it would have been totally and
irrevocably.

&nbsp;

Because of
the stress that the torments and tortures had put on her body, there was a
silver lining.� Her muscles were
developed beyond what one would have expected of a prisoner forced into a
sedentary life.� Her legs had slender but
feminine curves.� The brown skin of her
thighs had a sheen.� Her soft tummy was
flat but not so flat that her ribcage stood out above it with more than a small
outline.� Nobody is perfect.� Her breasts might be considered a mite too
small but her shoulders, her neck, and her face filled me with erotic desire.

&nbsp;

The
sentence to go to the capital had taken me by surprise.� This sentence had given me a tremendous opportunity
for the murder.� But how could I escape
the aftermath?� After the killing came
the problems of disposal and my own fate.�
I pondered the elements of this trip.�
Then in my mind, something clicked.�
In my plan an important piece connecting�
those two puzzles fell into place.

III.� Daily Routine - Evening Session:� After the prisoner�s afternoon meal, take her
to the classroom.� This is a small room
with just one student desk.� Sit her down
in the seat and make her sit facing left.

&nbsp;

Attached to
desk legs under chair find wood stocks for the occupant�s feet.�� This is a box with two holes in it.� The apparatus swings 90 degrees to the left
for leg insertion and then back.� Swing
them out until they click.� Remove leg
chains.� Unlock the box, place each foot
into it�s designated hole, then lock stocks snugly shut against the prisoner�s
ankles.� Swing prisoner�s legs and stocks
into place under desk and lock in place.�
Prisoner will now be facing forwards.

&nbsp;

Bend
prisoner�s head down to desk.� Place wire
crown on top of her head.� This crown
consists of a circle of wire whose radius matches the back of the prisoner�s
skull.� Attach wires from each side of
desk sides of to crown.� The purpose of
this crown is to force prisoner to look straight down to desktop and to prevent
head motion in any other direction.

&nbsp;

Keep
manacles on prisoner�s hands but lock them to designated chain on the
desk.� 

&nbsp;

The result
of these procedures will be that the prisoner�s legs are immobilized by her
ankle restraints, her hands secured to desk and given just enough mobility to
write on paper laid in front of her, and her head and eyes restrained from
looking anywhere else but the papers placed under her on the desktop.

&nbsp;

Procter
shall give her the writing assignment for the day.� When command is given, the prisoner must
begin writing and continue to write without stopping.� This mandatory �stream-of-consciousness�
exercise is an excellent interrogation technique which will cause prisoner to
divulge background information about herself that can be used against her in
other torment sessions.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I have no
boyfriends.� You already killed everybody
I had ever cared about.� I have no other
names to give you.� I don�t know why you
killed them.� I don�t even know why you
are doing this to me.� I am
innocent!� Please let me go.� I didn�t do anything wrong.

&nbsp;

I used to
worry about dates with boys.� I used to
worry about if he [sic] liked me or even if he thought I was pretty.� I was sure I could never look as good as some
of the other girls.

&nbsp;

But none of
this matters.� I am condemned for
life.� My life is over.� I don�t even remember their names!�� I am your prisoner now.�

III.� Daily Routine - Descent into the Dungeon:� Bind prisoner with hands behind her back, leg
shackles, and blindfold.� Guards on each
side of prisoner shall firmly hold her arms.�
Enter Dungeon Building and slowly march her down stairs.� Stop at landing.� Slide heavy bomb-proof doors open.� March prisoner through.� Stop prisoner and close heavy doors close
behind her.� Descend steps to
elevator.� Be advised that dungeon used
to be old mine so that there are many steps to go down.� Put prisoner in and descend to lowest
levels.� Exit and continue descending
stairs to bottom.� Unlike ascent in
mornings, prisoner must fully evening�s descents by walking down all the way
and hearing the heavy doors closing behind her.

&nbsp;

* * * *

&nbsp;

She was so
tired.� We finished cuffing her
wrists.� �No, I don�t want to go in
there,� she said.� �Please don�t make
me.�� I slid the blindfold over her
head.� �I�d like to go back to my cage
now.�� She added, �Please.�

&nbsp;

The head
guard slid the door open.� It hit the end
of it�s track with a loud boom.� She
said, �The night air is actually quite pleasant, don�t you think?� Ooo, feel that breeze.�� We grabbed her arms and shoved her inside.

&nbsp;

�Evening is
just the best time, right?� Don�t you
guys think so?� Anything to say?� Guys?�
Come on.� Talk to me.�� March, march, march.� Down, down, down.� Even to us it seemed as if we were being entombed
in the lowest caves of the Earth, one where we would never be found, one where
we would never escape and we were the guards and we could see our way in and
out.� What must have it be like to Maria?

&nbsp;

Down, down,
down.� We came to the first bombproof
door.� We halted her.� The head guard inserted the key and slid it
open.� Boom!� The door was open.� Maria sighed.�
We marched her through.�
Boom!� The door was closed.

&nbsp;

March,
march, march.� Down, down, down.� Her chatter was incessant and trivial.� I wished she would shut up.� The pitch of her voice went higher and higher.� At the bottom of the elevator she started
sobbing.� Her knees started to
buckle.� We forced her to keep standing.� Then we continued to march her down.

III.� Daily Routine - Down into the Pit:� An automatic door separates the bottom level
from the lower dungeon.� Bring prisoner
through and make her descend to platform.�
Remove blindfold, handcuffs, and leg chain.� Order her to remove her clothes and stand
naked.� Hand her the white sleep garment
and order her to put it on.� Put her 8
inch chains on her wrists and her leg chains on her ankles.� She shall remain standing throughout the
procedure.� Order her to raise her arms
in straight up vertical position.� Lower
hook.� Order her to place her wrist chain
over hook.� Raise hook and prisoner and
position over her cell pit.

&nbsp;

The pit is
20 feet down with vertical wall.� There
are no handholds on the walls and no way to get out without the assistance of
the hook.� Floor and walls are concrete.� Cell furnishings consist of cot for sleeping
and bowel for toiletries.� Prisoner�s
dress must be white so as to be visible in dim light.� 

&nbsp;

When
prisoner reaches bottom, order her to lift her chain from hook.� Raise hook.�
Order her to place her sleep helmet on her head.� Helmet operator will activate green light on
wall when helmet�s connection is made.�
Look down into pit and observe that X has complied with all
requirements.� X must remain standing
until you give her permission to move.�
Then she may lay down in cot and go to sleep.

&nbsp;

Leave pit
area and close door behind you.

&nbsp;

In case of
any defiance of prisoner of any of these orders or procedures, remove her from
her pit immediately and return her to surface using sensory deprivation
procedures enumerated in morning wake-up section above.� She will have forfeited that night�s sleep
period and punishment will commence.�
Report to head guard for further instructions.

&nbsp;

* * * *

&nbsp;

We have now
descended into the lowest depths of the dungeon.� It is so deep that everybody dreads climbing
the stairs on the trip back up.� Every
time I come down here, I am oppressed by the stillness of the air and the dread
quiet.� Nobody ever comes down here
except the detail assigned for the prisoner.�
Oh, and the poor person assigned to clean up the prisoner�s pit.� If the prisoner wasn�t there, nobody would
ever come down here at all.

&nbsp;

X is never
as alone and as vulnerable as when she is in the pit.� When we left, only her sleep helmet connected
her to the outside world and that only to the operator monitoring her signals
in the control room far above.

&nbsp;

I pondered
the implications of this for my plan.�
Yes, the pit will be a central scene of the murder.

IV. Health
Issues

&nbsp;

It is our
objective to keep the prisoner mentally and physically healthy so that the
maximum usefulness can be extracted from her.�
Stories of long term torture may sound good in theory and even better in
fiction; in practice torture duration may be truncated by prisoner
breakdown.� The health policies are
designed to prevent this from occurring.

&nbsp;

The prisoner�s
health shall be the primary responsibility of the Medical Adjutants
(MA�s).� The MA�s shall check X�s vital
signs every 15 minutes throughout the day.�
They shall also monitor X�s mental state.� Guards shall defer to MA�s whenever health
issues are raised.

&nbsp;

Long
periods of restraint may put pressure on the heart, lungs, and muscle
tissue.� The physical exercise periods
are designed to prevent atrophy of vital body systems while integrating into
daily regimen of torment and suffering.�
The Cage provides a break for mental recovery while maintaining the
atmosphere of helplessness and restraint.

&nbsp;

Prisoner is
deprived of almost everything but the bare essentials needed for psychological
sanity.� She is deprived of any human
companionship.� She is allowed no
knowledge of the outside world.� She is
allowed no possessions.� She has no
control of what she wears and even what she has been assigned to wear is
minimal.� She is not even allowed control
of her own person.� Every minute of her
life is regimented.

&nbsp;

We inflict
three levels of punishments on the prisoner.�
First level punishments are the regular, daily punishments.� There are a large number of them on the menu.� Some of these were described in Section
III Daily Routine, subsection Daily Punishments above.� Should prisoner decide that things are so bad
that they can�t get any worse, she may decide to just give up and slack
off.� To neutralize that, the second
level punishments were instituted.� These
punishments are meant to provide the ultimate in pain, fear, and
suffering.� Their effects upon the
prisoner will be especially lengthy and brutal.�
Therefore the tribunal will impose them infrequently and only under
exceptional circumstances.� Level 2
punishments are discussed in Section V. Special Punishments below.� The third level of punishments are the public
punishments.� These are implemented on a
regular basis to make an example of the prisoner and to strike fear into the
people of the region.� Level 3
punishments are discussed in Section VII. Public Example
below.

&nbsp;

V.� Special Punishment

&nbsp;

Prisoner
must be made aware at all times that behavior outside of normal parameters will
be disciplined with especially drastic punishments.� The Authority reserves the right to impose
such punishments upon X as it deems fit.�
These extraordinary punishments may include but are not limited to the
following.

&nbsp;

Firing
Squad:� This punishment simulates the terror and pain
of being shot by a firing squad while eliminating the fatal aspect of the
experience. The firing squad uses non-lethal rubber bullets and bursts of rock
salt.� The special guns and ammunition
for this kind of shooting was developed by the US and the democracies of Europe
to give police a humane way to deal with extreme situations in riots.� The punishment is actually worse for the
prisoner because for her, the procedure does not end with the impact of bullets
on her body.� 

&nbsp;

* * * *

&nbsp;

When the
special tribunal pronounced sentence on the prisoner, her whole body
shuddered.��� All I knew of the firing
squad was the instructions in the guard�s manual but she had faced it before,
so she knew what to expect.� Even though
she was kneeling and her ankles were strapped together, her feet started
tapping on the cement floor.� I lifted
her up.� Her jaw was quivering and her
eyes were open wide.� Her back lay in my
arm; my other arm was under her knees.�
She put her manacled hands behind my head and lay shaking in my arms.� She put her face in my shoulder.� I carried her to the door before I set her
down.� It seemed to me that she should
get some kindness at least.

&nbsp;

Then the
other guards and I readied her for transportation.� One unstrapped her ankles and checked that
her legs were properly hobbled.� Some of
the rest of us unlocked her hand cuffs and moved her arms behind her back.� We crossed her wrists and cuffed them
together.� The head guard, cruel as
always, lowered X�s blindfold over her eyes and then wrenched her head to the
side and whispered into her ear.� I
didn�t catch all that he said, only something about what he�d do to her after
she had been shot.� She shuddered
again.� Then he kissed her.� She collapsed to the floor.

&nbsp;

We picked
her up and marched her to the special holding cell.

&nbsp;

* * * *

&nbsp;

From Orientation
for X.

&nbsp;

V.� Special Punishment - Firing Squad
(continued):��� The holding cell has
padded walls and floor.� No furniture
(cots, tables, or chairs), no furniture or items of any kind are allowed in the
cell.� There are no windows.� The door locks with a soundproof seal.� The only features of the cell are a
surveillance camera and a large digital clock.�
Both of these hang from the ceiling out of the prisoner�s reach.� No sound may come through the cell�s walls.� There is no light except that coming from the
large digital clock.

&nbsp;

Allow the prisoner
a toilet break before inserting her into the cell.� Once she is inside, remove her blindfold but
leave her legs shackled and her arms cuffed behind her back.

&nbsp;

The clock
will be set to four hours.� It will count
down to zero from there.� The prisoner
will have nothing to do but sit in a corner and watch the clock count down to
her doom.

&nbsp;

* * * *

&nbsp;

I sit in
the corner facing away from the clock but there is a vague reflection on the
opposite walls.� I am not able to escape
the sound of it�s ticking.� It is a very
soft sound; that only makes it more stressful.�
I shiver.� How I wish my ears were
plugged and my eyes blindfolded!� I know
that this clock is part of the torture but I can�t escape it.� I turn around and squat on my knees.� My butt rests on my feet; I bury my face in
the corner.� I still can�t escape that
dreadful sound.� The knowledge of what
they will do to me is ripping me apart.�
I�m so sick, I feel like throwing up.�
My skin itches all over, especially on my back.� The vertical lock on my cuffs prevents me
from raising my hands above the small of my back.� I can rub my arms against my sides but I
can�t reach my back.� I turn around and
rub my back against the wall.

&nbsp;

I�ve got to
turn my mind to something else.� This is
my invisible book with my invisible writing.�
I can�t remember much of what I�ve written in it before.� Someday, when I really do die, maybe God will
show me my book so that I might read it.�
How I wish those bullets were real!�
Then I won�t have to experience what they will do to me after the
shooting.� In fact, this whole nightmare
would end.

&nbsp;

I�ve got to
think of something else.� 

&nbsp;

I�m
thinking now of Whoopi Goldberg.�
Why?� I saw that movie where she
was a nun.� It was very funny.� I especially liked the singing.� She did a take-off on �My Man�.� This is weird.� Or maybe not.�
The other day they dressed me up like a nun and flaunted me on the
capital.� I could have been a nun.� A nun isn�t so bad.� In the movie there was a scene where the
Mother Superior told Whoopi�s character that as a nun she would have to observe
three rules:� 1) Poverty (Whoopi said she
that could handle that); 2) Obedience (Whoopi said she that could handle that,
too); and 3) Chastity which means no men (Whoopi said �I�m out of here.�)

&nbsp;

Me, I never
cared about money so that would be easy.�
The men part might be a problem.�
I liked going out on dates; I especially liked them when the boy would
treat me right.� If I fell in love,
married and started raising a family, that would be good.� It would be like the old days in our village
when Papa and Mama were alive, only I would be Mama.� Christmas would be grand.� We�d go up the hill and have a huge picnic.� But nuns have Christmas, too.� If the convent was filled with sisters who
were real sisters to one another, sisters in attitude and love not just as a
title, I could fit in with that.� We
could teach school or maybe serve an orphanage, so that would be like having
children, too.� No, the big problem with
being a nun for me is the requirement for obedience.� A nun looses control of her life.� She must go where she�s told and do what
she�s told.� But I know that the
authorities in the church basically means well.�
They make mistakes but they try to do right, well, mostly anyhow.� So, I suppose I could live with that, too.

&nbsp;

But I can
never be a nun.� Or a wife.� Or a mother.�
I can never be anything but what I am right now, a helpless prisoner.� Getting hurt is my occupation.� Today it will be worse, much worse.

&nbsp;














At zero we opened the cell door and came in

At zero we
opened the cell door and came in.� X sat
in the corner, her legs crossed and her head bowed.� The head guard put his hand on top of her
head and snapped it back.� �Ready to be
shot?� he asked with a wide grin.� �Yes,�
she said very quietly.� The head guard
said, �What, no jokes?�

&nbsp;

�No.�

&nbsp;

The head
guard squatted down and peered into her face.�
X just stared ahead with a calm expression.� It appeared to me that she had accepted her
fate.

&nbsp;

We made her
stand up and then we took off her chains and handcuffs.� Then the head guard ordered her to take off
her clothes.� They weren�t much, just the
usual shorts, chest strap, and panties but her firing squad uniform was more
minimal still.� It was a small
bikini.� The firing squad needed
precision aiming for this task; no dress or robes to obscure their targeted
places on her body.� Of course it�s color
was black, the only appropriate color for such an event.� She stood in the middle of the cell.� Her bikini bottom covered only her pubic area
and the crack in her butt.� As small as
her breasts were, her bikini top was so thin that for the first time I saw
cleavage while she was clothed.� I
reflected that these two items of cloth was the only things she wore.� She had no jewelry, no piercings for her
earrings, nothing for her hair, no shoes, nothing at all.� This was the poorest woman on earth.

&nbsp;

Once she
was properly suited up, we hobbled her legs, blindfolded her and led her
outside.� We left her hands free so that
she could take a potty break on the open toilet just outside the special
cell.� We stood around it and carefully
watched her as she used her hands to remove her bottom and maneuver on it.� When she was done, she stood up, wiped
herself, put her bottom back up, and stretched her hands groping blindly for
the sink.� When she found it, she
splashed water on her face and on her hair.�
She started using her finger nails to try to comb her hair.� �Uh, uh,� the head guard said, �no messing
with your blindfold.�� The prisoner
sighed, dropped her hands to her sides, and turned her back to the sink to face
us.� �Take two steps forward,� the head
guard commanded.� She did.� �Okay, let�s finish her up, boys.�� We put her arms behind her back, crossed her
wrists, and secured them with the handcuffs.

&nbsp;

She stood
there staring into space with blind eyes, not knowing what else we were doing.

&nbsp;

I grabbed
one of her arms in the regulation grab; another guard did the same to her other
arm.� We marched her to the execution
field.� Along the way we heard a loud
crack.� It sounded like multiple rifles
going off at once.� �The firing squad
must be practicing,� I thought.

&nbsp;

We came
through the gate and approached the scene.�
For the first time since I had been employed here, I was truly struck
with horror.� A large wooden post was
planted in the dirt.� Another prisoner
was tied to it.� I recognized her as one of
the condemned murderers from death row.�
Some terrorist something or another, I couldn�t remember what.� I really hadn�t been paying attention to
anything else since I had been assigned to the X detail.� My mind was edging over into hysteria.

&nbsp;

The head
guard guffawed and pushed the three of us, prisoner and us two guards holding
her arms, forward to the post.� He snatched
the blindfold from X�s head.� X blinked
her eyes, looked at the prisoner tied to the post, glanced towards the firing
squad and screamed.� She wrenched her
body and started running away.� I don�t
know about the guard holding her other arm but I was so astonished, I actually
let go!� She took about two steps before
she tripped over her leg chains and fell to the dirt.� The head guard was laughing uproariously; the
six men in the firing squad stood there grinning.� Me and the other guard took hold of X, got
the proper grips on her arms and put her back into position facing the prisoner
tied to the post.

&nbsp;

That
prisoner was quite dead.� That execution
had been for real, oh yeah, very real.�
From her shoulders to her knees, the bullets had torn huge holes in her
body.� We could see her organs, glands,
and other guts.� Some of them were
spilling down her legs and onto the ground.�
The dirt was crawling with blood and guts.� Then I saw creepy insects; they were the
reason the dirt seemed to crawl.� For
them, this was a feast.

&nbsp;

There is
nothing sexy or erotic about a real execution.

&nbsp;

Special
guards were assigned to the execution area.�
They cut the cords holding the body to the post with machetes.� It fell to the ground.

&nbsp;

�X screamed and gasped and then screamed some
more.� She struggled in our arms, trying
to break free.� She was pretty hysterical
but I must admit that I wasn�t too far behind her myself.� The guards loaded the body onto a
wheelbarrow.� They hacked off one
snakelike piece of gut that was oozing out from beneath the body�s belly and
left it on the ground.� Then they wheeled
the body away.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

We obeyed
the head guard�s orders and pushed X into the middle of the mess.� We had our boots on; she had nothing but her
bare feet.� We removed the handcuffs but
tightly held her arms.� The execution
field special guards took over.� We let
go of her and got out of the way.� �Step
back to the post.�� X stepped back.� The guards commanded her to put her feet
together.� �Back your heals against the
post.�� They made her stand straight, so
that her feet, legs, butt, back, and head solidly abutted the post.� X had lapsed into a trancelike state.� Her breaths came in quick gasps.� Her chest heaved; her stomach rippled; her
jaw quivered.� �Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no .
. .� she repeated over and over.� Then
the guards began to tie her to the post.

&nbsp;

They made
her put her arms around the post with hands touching each other in back.� Because of the size of the post, she could
only touch her finger tips.� The guards
tied her hands together in that position.�
They then put rope across her chest and around the post.� X turned her face towards me and asked,
�Please do something!�� Her eyes were
pleading.� Her mouth was stretched in
that shape that comes when people beg for something from the bottom of their
heart.� I shook my head.� �I can�t.�

&nbsp;

I admit
that I had had ideas of eventually using the firing squad as a cover for my own
murder plan.� My thoughts had angled
towards sneaking special ammunition in the firing squads� guns.� I abandoned that idea right then and there.

&nbsp;

Another set
of ropes secured her legs to the post just above her knees.� Rope tied her ankles together.� More rope around the post tied them to it.� Behind the post, U shaped nails were driven
over the rope and pounded into the wood.�
This kept the rope from moving.�
This was done to all three sets of rope binding the prisoner to the
post:� the one around her chest; the one
around her knees; and the one around her feet.�
Finally, these nails were driven over the rope between her hands and
into the wood.� X was now completely
secured to the post. Unable to bend her legs, the prisoner lost her ability to
move her body downwards.� Multiple
restraints prevented her from moving her body sideways around the post.� Her feet were tied together so there was no
help from there either.� Ropes around her
chest prevented movement of her upper body.�
The ropes around her hands and knees served as backup to sideways
restraint.� With a minimal amount of
ropework, her body had been effectively immobilized.

&nbsp;

�What about
the blindfold?�� The head guard chuckled.
He twirled the blindfold in his hand and grinned at X.� �Naw, you don�t want to miss anything,� he
laughed.� As worried about my job as I
have been, I was so disgusted that I went over and snatched the blindfold out
the head guard�s hand.� �Hey!�� I ignored him.� I went over to the post.� As I began to press the blindfold down over
her hair, I couldn�t help but notice that X�s face was messy with tears and
snot coming from her nose, and drool from her mouth.� Down below a few drops of urine had come down
her leg.� She was a mess.� I took a rag and cleaned her up as best as I
could.� Then I put the rag over her nose
and told her to blow.� She tried but
everything had already come out.� She
looked up at me and said, �Thank you.�� I
lowered the blindfold over her eyes.�
�You�ll get through this,� I said.�
She whispered back, �I know.�

&nbsp;

The head
guard said, �Now get away from her, you prissy prick.�� I did.�
He glared at me. �I realized that
I had made a powerful enemy and I despaired.

&nbsp;

The
sergeant of the guards marched up to the prisoner.� �It is customary for the condemned to have a
last smoke,� he said.� �Please don�t,�
Maria (I was back to thinking of her as Maria again) said.� She pleaded.�
�Isn�t this bad enough?� I don�t
smoke; I�ve never smoked.� The only time
was the last time you executed me.�

&nbsp;

�Well, now
that you�re experienced, how about a nice big cigar this time?�� The sergeant pulled out a jumbo Max Hoggie.
He bit off an end, struck a match on the post beside Maria�s ear and lit the
cigar up.� He held it under Maria�s
nose.� The cigar was so strong, I smelled
it all the way from where I stood.

&nbsp;

�Ready?�
the sergeant challenged.� He was already
pinching her nose shut with the fingers of one hand while pressing the cigar to
her mouth with the other.� �Please no,�
was all she could get out.

&nbsp;

Maria was
coughing and screwing her head around to avoid the smoke.� With the fingers pinching such a tender part
of the body as the nose, she could move her head very little.� Color drained from her cheeks.� One could not look at the part of her face
that was visible under the blindfold without thinking of such words as torment,
suffering, agony, and anguish.�� The
other guards stood there stone silent.�
Then I remembered that the main event had not even begun.

&nbsp;

�Hey,
doesn�t the condemned prisoner get a last request?�� This came from me.� I had already jumped over the cliff with the
blindfold/facewipe thing.� Still, I was
surprised to hear the words come out of my mouth.� The head guard regarded me with astonishment,
then with outright loathing.� �What are
you, her lawyer?�� I can�t remember if
this came from the sergeant or my head guard.�
Either way, I was screwed.� I
might as well kiss my job goodbye.� 

&nbsp;

�Well, uh,�
I stammered, �aren�t we doing enough?� I
mean as it is, I mean.� And,� I
sighed.� Oh, well, might as well say it.� �If we are going to follow customs, the
prisoner is entitled to a last request.�
And she did request that you not make her smoke.�

&nbsp;

The
sergeant glared at me.� 

&nbsp;

Maria
continued to choke and cough.� Suddenly,
the sergeant withdrew the cigar.� �Our
team observes the customs.�� He
straightened to posture of defiance.� He
said to me, �Nobody can ever say otherwise.��
He turned to somebody sitting on the side, I assume some kind of
clerk.� He said, �Let the record show
that the prisoner�s last request was that she not smoke.�

&nbsp;

There was a
short pause.� The sergeant started to
walk to the side of his firing squad.� 

&nbsp;

�No it was
not.��� Maria was still coughing, but
those words had definitely come from her.

�What?�� I think we all said that.� 

&nbsp;

The
sergeant spun on his heels and charged to the prisoner tied to the post.� �I swear I have had enough of this,� he
yelled.� �If not having to smoke was not
your last request, I�m going to stuff this cigar back into your mouth and cram
it down your throat!�

&nbsp;

Maria stood
there staring ahead with her blinded eyes.�
Her jaw was quivering again.

&nbsp;

�Well,
answer me!�� The sergeant was fairly
screaming now himself.� �Your time limit
for last requests expires in the next five seconds.�

&nbsp;

�I,
I,�� she was stammering, �I w want the
name of the woman who was just here.�

&nbsp;

Now I was
getting mad.� Had I just thrown my job
away for nothing?� �Do you realize that
he�s going to put that cigar back into your mouth?� Do you realize that you will have to face the
aftermath of your shooting with your lungs filled with that cigar�s smoke?�� I was yelling.

&nbsp;

She turned
to me or rather she turned her face to the sound of my voice.� �I know,� she said simply.� She was still hacking but except for that,
she had suddenly grown calm.� �I want to
pray for her.�

&nbsp;

The
sergeant snorted and spat on the ground.�
The men in the firing squad shook their heads in derision.� The sergeant said, �Alright but do you know
that that prisoner was a Communist.� She
was a terrorist.� She didn�t believe in
any God and is now surely in hell.�

&nbsp;

�Maybe, but
I want to pray for her anyway.�

&nbsp;

The
sergeant was actually surprised.� �Do you
mean that you will take this smoke so that you can have the name of a person
you don�t even know and is already dead?�

&nbsp;

Maria�s
mouth worked into a sideways grin.� �I
don�t suppose that I could get a two for one deal here, could I?�

&nbsp;

The
sergeant was stamping his foot, he was so beside himself.� �You�re out of time!� Now what is it?� Smoke or name?�

&nbsp;

�Name.�

&nbsp;

The
sergeant spat the name into her ear.� He
turned and glared at the clerk person.�
�You got that?�� The prisoner
nodded.

&nbsp;

�Alright,
now here�s your smoke.�� The prisoner
stood silently staring ahead though her eyelids were shut by the pressure of
the blindfold.� The sergeant held the
cigar to his side and peered into the face of the prisoner.� The prisoner could not look back.� She just stood there with her lips together
with sadness but acceptance.

&nbsp;

The head
guard said to the sergeant, �I think I can help you out with that.�� He produced a set of noseplugs from his
pocket.� �I remember from last time.�� The sergeant nodded.� The head guard walked over and put them into
the prisoner�s nose.

&nbsp;

With
breathing restricted to her mouth, the cigar went in easily.� The prisoner was soon coughing and choking to
beat the band.� She stood there in all
the muck and horror with a cigar in her mouth, not knowing how to smoke, not
knowing how to get the smoke out of her lungs.�
She stood there as miserable a figure as I had ever seen with her lungs
constantly filling with the smoke.� She
stood there until the MA�s made the sergeant stop.

&nbsp;

She stood
there with her body already exhausted.�
Only the ropes held her up.� The
one remedy the human anatomy has to extreme punishment is fainting but the
prisoner was even denied that last relief because of the coughing.� Even when the noseplugs were removed, relief
did not come.� Instead the torture of the
coughing continued as the respiratory system worked to empty the lungs of the
smoke.� All the while the stench of the
dead predecessor�s remains wafted up and around the post.� The insects started crawling up her legs.

&nbsp;

It was now
time for the main event.� The sergeant
had taken station beside his squad.

&nbsp;

�Firing
squad, attention!�

&nbsp;

�Raise
arms!�� Six men raised six rifles.

&nbsp;

�Ready
arms!�� Six rifle butts were planted into
six shoulders as six barrels were lowered into the horizontal firing position.

&nbsp;

�Aim!�� Six laser targeting systems were
activated.� I noticed the red dots on the
prisoner�s thighs, chest, and shoulders.�
The firing squad was going for broken bones, not permanent injury.� It was going to hurt like hell.

&nbsp;

But for the
prisoner�s coughing and the buzz of flies over the human mess at her feet, the
field was silent.� She probably felt the
slight heat of the laser beams on her skin, so she knew where the bullets would
strike.� The ropes held her body
fast.� The knowledge of what was coming
and the anticipation of it only tortured her mind even more.

&nbsp;

�Fire!�

&nbsp;

The body
shuddered as the bullets hit it.� Maria�s
head rolled and sagged.� The trauma to
her body that the bullets had caused had finally made her faint.� The fainting spell lasted for only the
briefest of times as the lungs demanded to breath and so the coughing woke her
back up.

&nbsp;

The ropes
held her fast to the post while she coughed her remaining strength away.� On the surface it seemed as if nothing had
happened.� She stood there against the
post, a picture of soft flesh and rope.�
But then the guards began to cut away her ropes.� They first cut the rope tying her hands
together.� The arms drifted back from
behind the post and hung limply at her side.�
They cut the ropes around her feet.�
Then they cut the ropes above her knees.�
No sooner had they been cut than the knees immediately began to
buckle.� Only the ropes beneath her now
dislocated shoulders held her against the post.�
Now they were cut, too.� She fell
straight to the ground.� She lay there in
the muck, her chest heaving while she coughed up everything she had in her.

&nbsp;

I couldn�t
help but reflect that the dead Communist terrorist whatever was a lucky woman
after all.� If there was a God and He did
value prayer, then He must know that rarely had such a prayer ever been offered
as the one I had witnessed here.� This
wasn�t fanaticism, this was caring, caring enough to sacrifice.� Dying is easy; living, now that is hard.

From Orientation
for X.

&nbsp;

V.� Special Punishment - Firing Squad
(continued):� Immediately after the
execution, MA�s shall examine prisoner.�
When they have finished their preliminary evaluation and cleared the
release, the special unit of guards shall cut the ropes holding prisoner to the
post.� The fall from the post to the
ground will likely result in much pain from the injuries sustained in the
shooting.� When the prisoner hits the ground,
responsibility passes from the special unit back to you.� Keep in mind that further injuries may result
while handling prisoner.� Put the
prisoner onto a stretcher by rolling her onto it and carry her to the medical
facility.� As always blindfold must be
securely in place when transporting prisoner between sections of the
prison,.� Doctors will administer X-Rays
and determine the extent of injuries incurred to that point.� Medical procedures will be limited to
diagnosis and only essential care.� 

&nbsp;

When
cleared from Medical, carry prisoner on stretcher to the regular punishment
field.� Set stretcher on ground and roll
her off it onto her back.� Prisoner will
probably have sustained broken bones in both arms and legs and will be in great
pain.� Spread prisoner�s arms and legs
directly out from body in spread eagle position.� Pound stakes into ground just beyond her feet
and hands.� Tie feet and hands to the
stakes.� Remove blindfold.

&nbsp;

Prisoner
shall be left in this position for 24 hours.�
MA�s will monitor prisoner and prescribe water and nutrients as
necessary.� Guards shall be present for
the entire period.� Individual guards
shall rotate into and out of the punishment area according to their assigned
shifts.� Guards shall interrogate
prisoner and shall administer pain to the extent necessary to fulfill the
prisoner�s sleep deprivation sentence.

&nbsp;

After the
24 hour period is over, untie prisoner, blindfold her, and carry her back to
the Medical Center on the stretcher.�
There she will receive treatment. �Some bones may need to be rebroken so that
they can be set properly.

&nbsp;

Carry her
to the cage.� She will remain in her cage
exposed to the rain and the other elements until she fully recuperates.� Guards shall closely watch her for the entire
period.� Estimated recuperation time is 6
to 8 weeks.

&nbsp;

* * * *

&nbsp;

It was
raining.� The downpour was turning the
ground to mud.� Fortunately, we had
pounded the stakes far enough in so that X�s arms and legs were held firmly in
place.� The other guards drifted to the
shelter of the wall.� I stayed behind to
guard the prisoner.� I looked down at the
her.

&nbsp;

She lay on
her back in the mud. She was still in her black bikini.� Her arms and leg were spread eagled out and
tied to the stakes.� She had not tried to
move them since we had tied her down.�
She still had a slight cough.� I
imagined that her throat must be raw and her chest one cavity of hurt.� As I stood over her, I noticed that she moved
her head from side to side, trying to find a position to get her face out of
the rain and failing each time.� There
were giant bruises where the bullets had hit.�
There were more bruises on her chest than could be accounted for by the
bullets.� The MA�s told us that the
X-Rays had shown minimal bone breakage and so she had not received any
treatment so far, that is treatment of a positive variety.� 

&nbsp;

I leaned
down to shield her face from the rain with my body.� She was moaning and coughing and moaning and
coughing.� I took a handkerchief out of
my pocket and wiped her face with it.� It
was as wet as everything else outside but I hoped that it would give her some
relief.� She stopped turning her head and
looked at me.

&nbsp;

�Oh, it�s
you,� she said.

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry
what he did.�� I really was.

&nbsp;

No sooner
had we taken her off the stretcher and pounded the stakes into the ground, than
the head guard had knelt beside the prisoner.�
She had been yelling with pain from the lifting of her injured legs and
arms.� He grabbed her by her hair and
pulled her face to his.� It had still
been only an hour since the execution, so she was still coughing horribly.� �Remember what I promised you,
jokester?�� X just moaned and coughed.

&nbsp;

He turned
to the other guard and me.� �You don�t
need to see this.� Turn around and look
the other way.�

&nbsp;

�I�m
already a goner anyway.�

&nbsp;

�This will
put us back to even.� Turn around.�

&nbsp;

I turned
around.� �Ahh!� X yelled.� Then silence.�
I turned around again.� X had
fainted but her coughing had waken her back up.�
The head guard had his hand under X�s bikini bottom.� He was clearly sticking his fingers up the
insides of her private area.� X�s hips
were writhing and she was bobbing her head up and screaming.� He grimaced and grimaced and pushed further
into her.� Her back arched, her mouth
opened wide but no sound came out.�
Without the strength to keep her head up, she dropped it back to the
ground and then brought it up again.�
Only coughs broke her screams, silent screams, ghastly screams.

&nbsp;

This was
definitely in violation of the regulations.�
Where were the MA�s?� Only us
three guards were there with the prisoner.�
I wondered about that.� �You�re
not seeing anything,� the head guard said.

&nbsp;

�Nope,� I
replied.� �I�m not seeing a thing.�

&nbsp;

He nodded
to me.� I nodded back at him.

&nbsp;

�Up to
now.� I�m about to start noticing real
soon.�

&nbsp;

�Fuck you.�

&nbsp;

�I figure
you got more to loose if it comes down to it.�

&nbsp;

He scowled
and withdrew his hand.� �Don�t think you
have something on me for long.�

&nbsp;

�Fine.� All I want is to get back to even with you,
head guard.�

&nbsp;

He pondered
this for a moment.� �Alright.� Done.�
I�ve had my fun.�� He removed his
hand and let the bikini bottom snap back to the prisoner�s flesh.

&nbsp;

That had
been ten hours before and I meant what I had just said to X (I mean
Maria.)� It was night and the rain
continued to pour down.

&nbsp;

I looked at
her and contemplated what a hot babe she was.�
Her was black, her skin was a reddish brown as were most of the people
of our country.� Her body was petite and
thin.� I gently probed the bruises on her
chest.� She howled.� Cracked ribs, I concluded.� I lightly traced my finger down the side of
her leg, I�m not sure why.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Her face
was contorted in suffering but even now her personality glowed faintly through
it.� I wondered what kind of person she
was; I knew so very little about her.�
What would she have been like on a date?

&nbsp;

She
startled me out of my reverie.� �Hey,
knight in shining armor, don�t stop now.��


&nbsp;

�Uh, I�m
not hardly.�

&nbsp;

She had
calmed down.� That startled me, too.

&nbsp;

�Say why
aren�t you with the rest of them?�� She
gestured with her head to the other guards.�
We could only see dark forms huddling against the wall in the
blackness.� �It�s kind of unpleasant out
here.� You did happen to notice the rain
and the mud and stuff, didn�t you?�

&nbsp;

I couldn�t
help but smile.� �Actually, somebody�s
supposed to keep you awake.� You�re not
allowed to sleep, you know.� Sleep
deprivation.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah.� I supposed you�re not going to be singing me
any lullabies then.�

&nbsp;

�No, I�m a
bad singer.� Really bad.� In fact I would sing to you but I figured
you�re being tortured enough already.�

&nbsp;

�What�s
with you, anyway?�

&nbsp;

�What do
you mean?�

&nbsp;

�I mean the
proverbial question.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, what�s
a good man like me doing working in a dump like this?�

&nbsp;

She nodded
her head and smiled, �That�s pretty much it.�

&nbsp;

�Very
simple.� It�s a paycheck.� That�s all.�

&nbsp;

�How?�

&nbsp;

�How what?�

&nbsp;

�How did
you get this job?�

&nbsp;

�Oh, I have
a cousin in the army.� He�s in
explosives.�

&nbsp;

�I haven�t
talked to anybody in so long.�� I knew
what she meant.� �I think the others are
too far away to hear us.�

&nbsp;

I sat
there, looking into her face.� She lifted
her head.� I pushed it back down.� �You need your strength.�� She looked into my eyes.� I looked back into hers.� At length she said, �I�m writing a story you
know.�

&nbsp;

�Well, I�d
like to hear your story.�

&nbsp;

�I have an
invisible book.� That�s where I write �
in my invisible book.� I even have a
piece in there about you.�

&nbsp;

�Is it
about us having a date?� I blurted out.�
�I wish we�d have a date.�

&nbsp;

I thought
for a minute.� This was really going far
afield.

&nbsp;

�You know
I�m really particular about what kind of fellows I go out with and I�m really
tied down with this busy social schedule.�
But then you�ve noticed, I�m sure.�

&nbsp;

�Playing
hard to get, are you?�

&nbsp;

She started
to laugh.� �Oh, that hurts.�� There was a low moan.� �My whole chest feels like one big sore.�

&nbsp;

�How about
your arms and legs?�

&nbsp;

�Oh, I
don�t feel them anymore,� she said matter of factly.� �But my back really hurts.�

&nbsp;

�I really
am sorry.�

&nbsp;

�I wish I
could just go to sleep and never wake up again.�

&nbsp;

�No, you
don�t want to do that?�

&nbsp;

�Why
not?�� It was a genuine question.� So I gave her a genuine answer.� �Because I am going to do a murder.�

&nbsp;

That
startled her but only for a moment.� With
some anticipation in her voice, she asked, �Will you do it now?�

&nbsp;

�No, I�m
sorry.� There�s still the problem of the
aftermath.� My murder plan involves my
getting away with it.� That�s pretty
important.�

&nbsp;

�Well then,
talk to me about that date.�

&nbsp;

We chatted
like this for the next hour while the rain continued to pour.� I suggested she wear a nice sun dress.� She said she would a pants suit.� I said I liked to look at her arms and
legs.� They were sexy.� She said that she hadn�t worn anything over
her arms and legs for so long that she would wear the pants just for a
change.� And a blouse.� She had definite ideas about her blouse.� So we argued about that for awhile.� Then she wanted to know where I would take
her.� To a movie.� What movie?�
I told her that �The Sound of Music� was the best movie ever.� She said no, it was �The Wizard of Oz.�� So we argued about that.� While we were doing all this arguing I was
running my hand over her body, while avoiding her bruises and respecting her
private areas.� She accused me of
torturing her.� So I stopped.� Then she chewed me out for stopping.� So I put my hand along her face.� She pressed her cheek to my hand.� I said, �Oh, hell� and bent down and kissed
her.� She kissed back.

&nbsp;

�I don�t
even know your name.�

&nbsp;

�I can�t
tell you.�

&nbsp;

She was
surprised.� �Why not?�

&nbsp;

�It will
mess up my plan for the murder.�

&nbsp;

�You�re
serious?� You�re really going to murder
me?�

&nbsp;

�Yes I
am.�� And I was, in a way.

Thankfully
special punishments were imposed rarely.�
During the time I guarded X, I saw only three of them.� The execution I just described was one.� Each of the other two was pretty diabolical.

&nbsp;

The one
where they again forced the prisoner to wear her bikini and then took her on a
boat off the ocean and made her walk the plank, certainly qualified.� She stood at the edge of the plank and
gritted her teeth.� She bent her
legs.� She was determined to keep her
balance. But even a ship in the calmest of seas is rolling and pitching.� The chains cut into her legs as she tried to
move.� Her arms strapped behind her back;
this handicap to her upper body�s balance proved impossible to overcome.� Her face was a study in concentration and
determination as her body moved in time to the movements of the plank.� I remember her legs, especially how her inner
thighs curved to meet her private area.�
The flesh was so brown, it�s tone so shiny!� I just wanted to wrap my hands around her and
squeeze. But the result of the battle of the
prisoner�s courage and determination versus the chains binding her was
hopeless.� She inevitably lost and
toppled off into the waters and the horrors waiting her below.

&nbsp;

The
suspended cage was the cruelest of the three because of the control it demanded
of her attention.� The cage was suspended
a few feet above the ground.� It was so
small that the only way the prisoner could fit into it was to make her kneel
with her head between her knees.� There
is no way that a person can maintain that position for 36 hours in real life
(blood flow to the head would be fatal), so a hole in the wall of the cage was
cut and X was made to put her head through that.� The hole was then closed about her neck.� Electrodes were attached to the palms of her
hands and the bottoms of her feet and slaved to a computer.� The computer then flashed random questions at
a screen just above her head.� Each
multiple choice answer had an alpha-numeric code next to it.� She had to punch the code for the correct answer
in the number pad just below her nose within 30 seconds or a shock would zap
her.� The power has enough to really hurt
her.� The hands and feet had been
targeted for the electrodes because the nervous system in those parts of the
body are so sensitive and vulnerable.�
The prisoner had to constantly move her head up to see the questions and
then down to punch in the answers.� The
process prevented her mind from escaping by daydreaming or by �writing in her
invisible book�.� She had to constantly
concentrate on avoiding the zap.� She
collapsed, of course.� Many times, in
fact.� 36 hours is a day and a half � too
long for any human being to keep it up.�
Whenever she collapsed, they restarted her by really laying on the
torture.� 

&nbsp;

From Orientation
for X.

&nbsp;

VI.� Public Relations

&nbsp;

It was
anticipated from the outset that this operation would attract outside
attention.� In fact, one of this
operation�s prime objectives was to make an example of the prisoner to the
inhabitants of her region.� In formulating
the punishment program for the prisoner the regime was aware of the dangers of
negative publicity.� Our public relations
strategy for this operation is designed to cower the region�s inhabitants while
minimizing the publicity from outside media and humanitarian
organizations.� Our strategy will address
three audience groups.

&nbsp;

Domestic
Inhabitants:� We frankly acknowledge that the prisoner�s
punishment is especially intense.� Stress
that nobody should want to be sentenced to this prison.� Inhabitants should know that the government
will crush any opposition even the smallest.�
This means that if a peasant says to you that Maria Velasquez hardly did
anything wrong, you should turn that point around and say back that however
small you think the prisoner�s offense was it was very big in El Leader�s eyes
so you should avoid even the smallest opposition.� You would not want to see happen to the
person you are speaking to, what happened to Maria Velasquez.

&nbsp;

Be aware
that the Catholic Church has a high degree of influence and support in our
country.� It is very important that you
do not let this audience group think that the prisoner is a martyr.� Stress that her activities were done on her
own.� They were not sanctioned by her
church or by any other.� Don�t forget to
remind the peasants of the good relations El Leader enjoys with the Cardinal
and the other church leaders of our country.�
Minimize talk of Cardinal�s statements against government�s policing
policies by noting that the government must deal with the practical problems of
public safety and that El Leader and the Cardinal continues to dialogue
together to resolve their differences.

&nbsp;

Mention
that the prisoner is an agent of the US CIA.�
US industrialists would exploit our country and its people for their own
profits.� That is why El Leader has to be
so firm with the prisoner and others of her ilk.� He does not oppress the people; he protects
them.

&nbsp;

Others who
oppose El Leader are the bands of godless Marxists in the hills.� How can Maria Velasquez be a martyr for the
Church if she is on the same side as them?�
While the Marxists would take away the Church�s property, El Leader
generously contributes vast amounts to the Church every year.

&nbsp;

Finally, it
is most important to stress to the peasant farmers of the region that many of
them depend on the sale of the poppies that they grow for El Leader to sell on
their behalf.� If the prisoner and the US
government had their way, the entire narcotics trade would be ended and the
farmers would be left destitute.

&nbsp;

Foreigners
-- General Information:� Foreign observers can usually
be classified into two broad groups:�
Leftwing groups and rightwing groups.�
Both groups have their buttons.�
Governments like ours have made effective use of these buttons
throughout the world.� Once you have
properly classified the foreigner you are speaking with, then minimizing his or
hers organization�s interest in the Maria Velasquez case is merely a matter of
pressing the right button.

&nbsp;

Foreign
Groups with Left Wing Leanings:� These people tend
to respond very negatively to names like Pat Robertson and George Bush and very
positively to issues like abortion.� To a
person of this group, point out the prisoner�s strong religiosity.� She reads only one book and that�s the
Bible.� She also believes in the Pope�s
position on abortion.� That is usually
enough to do the trick with this group.�
Experience has shown that they usually loose sympathy for prisoners who
have been identified with these kinds of things.

&nbsp;

Foreign
Groups with Right Wing Leanings:� These people tend
to respond opposite to the left wingers to names like Pat Robertson and George
Bush and to issues like abortion.� To a
person of this group, point out the prisoner�s opposition to the established
government.� Note that the only organized
opposition is the Communists.� Call her
�a women�s rights activist.�� This
technique was used very successfully to deflect humanitarian concerns from
right wingers during the Reagan era in such places as El Salvador and
Nicaragua.

&nbsp;

Your PR
Role:� The reason this section is appearing in a
manual for prison guards is that all levels of officials who may interface with
the outside should be aware of our public relations strategy so that it may be
effective.� As the prisoner�s guards you
are the ones who are most familiar with her regimen.� Moreover, you are the ones who will accompany
her to her public punishments.� Hence,
you will be the ones closest to the people witnessing them.

&nbsp;

Prisoners
are harshly treated throughout the world with minimal negative consequences to
the governments involved.� Proper use of
public relations can allow us to punish the prisoner publicly while avoiding
negative publicity.
