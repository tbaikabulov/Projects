Julie Visits the Gym

Eighteen&nbsp; year old Julie Parker hurried along the school corridor hardly looking where she was going. She had loitered in the classroom until most of the girls had left, but now it was six minutes since the bell for the end of school had gone and she knew that she needed to hurry. Julie felt sick. She could feel her heart pumping away at twice its normal speed. The next half an hour or so was going to be awful in any case but at least she didn&#8217;t have to make it worse by being late. She hadn&#8217;t wanted anyone to see where she was going, but now she realised that she might have waited too long.

�Hey, Julie! Wait for me!�

Oh, god. It was the voice of Sheila, a girl in her class. The last thing she wanted to do was to talk to her now. Julie lowered her head, pretending that she hadn&#8217;t heard and continued to hurry along the corridor. It was no use. The other girl ran up to her and tapped her on the shoulder.

�Julie! Didn&#8217;t you hear me? Come on, let&#8217;s walk home together.�

Julie carried on walking quickly along the corridor and shook her head, not looking into Sheila&#8217;s eyes. �Um, no. I can&#8217;t Sheila. I&#8217;m sorry.�

�What&#8217;s the matter, Julie? Is something wrong?� asked Sheila, concerned at her friend&#8217;s unusual manner.

Julie decided that she would have to tell her. After all Sheila was her friend and she could trust her not to talk about it. It wouldn&#8217;t be so bad if Sheila knew &#8211; she&#8217;d been in the same position herself, after all.

Rather dramatically, she drew a small red envelope out of her pocket of her blue school blazer. �Look!�

Sheila immediately understood the significance. Red envelopes were given to the girls who had been told to attend one of Miss Drake&#8217;s weekly punishment sessions in the school gym. They contained the recommendation as to how many smacks from the gym mistress&#8217;s plimsoll or strokes of the cane the naughty girl should receive. They had to be delivered with their seals unbroken.

�Oh, Julie! I&#8217;m sorry � I never guessed. You kept that very quiet.�

�Yes, I didn&#8217;t want anyone to know. You won&#8217;t tell anyone, will you?�

�No. Of course not. Don&#8217;t worry. It&#8217;s your first time, isn&#8217;t it?�

Julie nodded.

�Well, you&#8217;ll be okay. Just do everything that Frances tells you straightaway. It&#8217;s horribly shameful and it does hurt but you&#8217;ll soon be over it. You&#8217;ll probably get the slipper, as it&#8217;s your first time &#8211; that&#8217;s not so bad. And you&#8217;re right. You&#8217;d better hurry &#8211; she&#8217;ll take it out on you if you&#8217;re late!�
Julie nodded and scurried on towards the gym. She knew that Sheila knew what she was talking about. Her friend had gone through a phase a couple of years earlier when she had attended more than one of Miss Drake&#8217;s punishment sessions. Sheila walked off more slowly in the opposite direction.

As Julie neared the gym she saw a queue of girls lined up outside the changing rooms under the eye of the young gym teacher. She was in time. Thankfully, she joined the end of the line.

The teacher looked at her watch and grunted, �Just in time! What&#8217;s your name, girl?�

Julie answered her, rather surprised that the teacher did not recognise her. She had taken her class for PE the year before. Miss Drake made a mark against her name in the list she was holding.

�Right! That&#8217;s it!� she announced. �It&#8217;s five to four. One girl&#8217;s still not here and she&#8217;ll be regretting it before too long! The rest of you file into the changing room and stand by the benches.�

When they were all in the room the gym mistress addressed the naughty girls.

�Right, girls! You are here for punishment. Most of you have been here before but I can see some new faces, so I&#8217;ll explain a few things. First, you are here because you have broken school rules in a particularly outrageous way or have misbehaved over a long period after warnings. You all deserve punishment and every one of you will leave this school today with a very sore bottom. When I punish a girl I make sure that she feels it. So if any of you were hoping to be let off, you can forget that idea right now!�

�Next, you each have a red envelope which contains recommendations made by the teacher who sent you here. But it is I, not he or she, who decides how many smacks of the plimsoll or strokes of the cane your backside will feet. I have authority to double the suggested punishment or, if I feel that the girl&#8217;s demeanour justifies it, I can reduce the number of strokes by a third. So if a teacher recommends four strokes I can administer between three and eight strokes,� she smiled grimly, �all fractions are rounded up, you see!�

After a pause she continued. �If eight or more smacks with the slipper have been recommended I can change the punishment to a caning and I can also vary a recommendation of the cane to a dose of the slipper. Teachers recommend up to twelve smacks of the slipper or eight strokes of the cane, but in their wisdom the governors limit me to twelve with the cane and twenty with the slipper! So a recommendation of eight strokes of the cane allows me between six and twelve. And, those of you who&#8217;ve been here before know, even three or four smacks from my plimsoll is not a pleasurable experience.�

�I will not tell you how many strokes you will get, but I expect you to stay in place until I tell you to stand. You have called the tune and now it is time for you to pay the piper. If you do not stay in place I will apply extra strokes. In addition, the maximum limit on strokes does not apply in this case, nor in any other instances of additional punishment for misbehaviour in my presence. So I strongly advice all of you to do what I say, when I say it!�

Julie had been looking around while the teacher was speaking. She hadn&#8217;t really been listening to what was being said &#8211; she had already heard most of it from the reports of Sheila and other naughty girls, or unlucky girls. She also knew that the slipper was the usual means of punishment for the first two years, whereas girls in the higher years were more likely to get the cane, unless it was their first time. Instead she was looking around to see if there were any girls she knew in the changing room. There were more girls than she&#8217;d expected &#8211; nine apart from herself. The first girl she recognised was Maxine Reynolds, a girl in her year but not in her class. That wasn&#8217;t a surprise. Maxine was always getting into trouble and she had not tried to hide the fact that she was due for another whacking. Maxine caught Julie&#8217;s eye and gave a rueful half-smile welcoming Julie to the club.

But Julie was surprised at the next girl she recognised. Caroline Levy, a girl in her class, was probably the last girl in the school she would have expected to see there. She was always such a well-behaved, quiet girl. What on earth could she have done? Julie hadn&#8217;t heard a whisper about it. Still, she&#8217;d done her best to keep her own punishment secret and presumably Caroline had done the same. Caroline avoided Julie&#8217;s eyes and gazed down towards her shoes.

One more face was familiar &#8211; Sarah Brookes, the elder sister of Julie&#8217;s best friend, Mandy. Sarah was eighteen years old and in the sixth form. Unlike most of the other girls there she was not dressed in school uniform. Instead she was wearing light brown slacks and a blue tee-shirt. Like Caroline, Sarah avoided returning Julie&#8217;s glance. Julie could imagine that at her age it must be terribly humiliating to be spanked at all and that it must be even worse for her to know that her baby sister&#8217;s best friend would witness her shameful ordeal.

There was another girl also wearing trousers instead of her school uniform. Julie knew that she must also be a sixth former like Sarah or else in the fifth year as all the girls apart from the seniors had to wear the uniform, but she did not recognise her.

Meanwhile Miss Drake was continuing with her lecture, but just as she did so the girls heard a hesitant knock on the changing room door. The gym teacher walked over and opened it. A frightened looking girl who Julie guessed was a second year was standing outside.

�Tracey Compton! You&#8217;re late!�

�I&#8217;m sorry, miss. I was on my way, but I really had to go to the toilet and when I got here the door was already closed. I didn&#8217;t know whether to knock or to go away. I&#8217;ve been standing there for ages!�

�Well! You made the right first choice in the end. It would have been worse for you if you hadn&#8217;t turned up at all. But, now, come in and stand there! You missed the part of my introductory talk when I explained that I can award corporal punishment for other misbehaviour- such as lateness &#8211; additional to that for the reason you&#8217;ve been sent here, so I will allow you to experience it for yourself. You will serve as a demonstration to the other girl who haven&#8217;t been here before of what a slippering is like.�

Tracey entered the changing room rather hesitatingly and trembling slightly. Miss Drake closed the door behind her and telling the dilatory girl to wait, went into her office and emerged a moment or two later carrying a large white plimsoll. �Bend over and hold onto your legs below your knees!� the gym mistress ordered.

Tracey obeyed. Julie had a good view of how the girl&#8217;s blue school skirt rose up as she did so; however, it still covered her bottom. She wondered if the teacher would order Tracey to lift her skirt, exposing her knickers. Instead, however, Miss Drake simply drew the slipper back and delivered an almighty whack to the naughty girl&#8217;s skirt covered rear.

Julie&#8217;s eyes widened in shock. She had never seen a slippering before and she was amazed to see just how much force the tall, fit twenty-five year old teacher was using. There were gasps of surprise from a couple of the fellow culprits, too. But poor Tracey&#8217;s reaction was still extreme. The force of the blow actually caused her to unbalance and topple forward. She was more embarrassed than hurt, however, although Julie realised that the whack must have really stung through the younger girl&#8217;s skirt and knickers, she soon scrambled to her feet and reassumed her position, rather red-faced.

The gym mistress delivered a further five hard smacks to the tightly-stretched seat of Tracey&#8217;s blue skirt. The girl managed to stay in position, holding on to her legs, but she could not prevent the audible gasp as each of the last smacks smashed down. Julie was still shocked at how hard the teacher was hitting the naughty girl. Each impact if the slipper was as loud as a pistol shot.

Finally it was over. Miss Drake put the plimsoll down on a shelf. �Remain in that position until I tell you to get up Tracey,� she said, �just in case I need to make use of your bottom to provide further examples to your colleagues.�

Julie could see Tracey&#8217;s face, upside down and largely hidden by her cascading brown hair. It was nonetheless evident that the girl was crying quietly. Julie was very pleased that she had just arrived in time; otherwise, she might have been in Tracey&#8217;s position.&nbsp; 

Miss Drake, ignoring the bending girl as she continued to wriggle in her uncomfortable and humiliating posture, continued her introductory remarks.

�I will expect you all to stay in position throughout your punishments. Like Tracey here you will not stand up until I tell you to.� The teacher added point to her remark by delivering a sharp hand slap to the girl&#8217;s bottom. Tracey&#8217;s whole body quivered but she remained bending forward.

�Anyone who does stand up before I give permission or anyone who puts a hand in the way or tries in any way to avoid or delay punishment will get extra strokes. And after punishment you will not rub, or even touch, your bottoms. Any girl who decides so will get extra. You will all change into PE kit, apart from plimsolls, for your punishment. You will wear the school gym shorts, tops and socks which you will find in the appropriate cupboard for your year. Any girl who normally takes off her glasses for gym should do so. They might fall off. You will change quickly and without fuss, but without knocking into each other. And be careful walking when you get into the gym! The floor can be slippery when you&#8217;re just wearing socks. Now, unless there are any questions, you can begin to change. As soon as you&#8217;re ready go into the gym and line up along the far wall facing the horse, with your hands on your heads. Remember to take your envelopes with you; and remember, time wasting will be punished.� And with that the gym mistress delivered another sharp slap to Tracey&#8217;s rear and told the unfortunate girl to stand up and find a place to change.

Julie didn&#8217;t expect that there would be any questions and she was just about to move towards the fourth year equipment cupboard when she heard a nervous voice. �Please miss!�

She looked around. It was the senior girl whose name she did not know.

�Lindsey Collins, 5A, isn&#8217;t it? What is it, girl?�

�Please miss, can&#8217;t we wear our own gym kit? I brought mine with me.� This was the sixteen year old&#8217;s first time at a punishment session. She was rather spoiled and didn&#8217;t want to wear shorts that other girls had worn. School gym shorts were navy blue but Lindsey&#8217;s own shorts, like those of most of the girls, were white in colour.

Julie thought that Miss Drake looked a little annoyed at the unexpected question, but she answered pleasantly enough.
 
�No, Lindsey. It&#8217;s the same for everyone &#8211; school kit.�

But Lindsey could not leave it alone. �Oh, please miss. Why not?�

Julie drew a deep breath. The stupid cow was going to get Miss Drake angry and make it worse for everyone!

�Right! Out her Lindsey!� snapped the teacher, taking the plimsoll from the shelf.

Julie looked at the tall fifth former. Her face suddenly went white with shock and her mouth dropped open. She walked slowly to the front, looking close to tears.

�Stand where Tracey did and bend forward.�

The dejected girl obeyed, taking hold of the material of her dark grey trousers just below the knee. For a couple of moments Julie thought she was going to say something but in the end Lindsey had just enough sense not to.

�Further over and keep your legs straight!� ordered the gym mistress.

As Lindsey bent as far as she could Julie saw the dark grey material at the seat of her trousers plump out as they stretched tautly over the sixteen year old&#8217;s large and curvy rear.

Slipper in hand the teacher turned to the watching girls. �Lindsey has, unintentionally I am sure, given me the opportunity for another useful demonstration. Tracey is a junior girl, so I let her off lightly. Now I will show you all, and especially Lindsey, what a real slippering is like!�

She turned towards Lindsey. �Right, Lindsey, stay bent over until I tell you you can get up.�

With that she raised the slipper up above her shoulders and walloped it down, twisting her body as she did so to put all her force into the blow, Julie saw immediately the gym mistress had not been bluffing. The severity of Tracey&#8217;s punishment had surprised her, but this was much worse. She saw the slipper dent deeply into the rounded curves of Lindsey&#8217;s trouser-clad bottom with a sound like a firework exploding.

The sixteen year old could not withhold a sharp �Oww!� but she remained bent over in position as the angry teacher continued to whack the rubber plimsoll down on her large backside, concentrating on each bottom check alternately.

After six smacks Miss Drake showed no signs of stopping and Lindsey&#8217;s yelps were beginning to sound more and more frantic. Another two smacks proved too much for the naughty teenager. With a frantic shriek she half straightened and one hand went to her right bottom check to protect it from further blows from that slipper. But Miss Drake did not pause. Instead she whipped the slipper down for another smack, just as hard, to land right on top of the back of Lindsey&#8217;s hand.

�Yeeoww! Oh! Oh! Oh!� Lindsey could not believe it. She twisted round dashing her injured had to her lips where she blew on it and fondled it against her lips.

�I warned you,� Miss Drake said, unsympathetically. �And it&#8217;s the same for all girls sent her for punishment. Anyone who stands up before I give permission, anyone who puts a hand in the way or tries to avoid or delay punishment will get extra. Now, Lindsey, bend over again right now &#8211; unless you want me to go and get my cane!�

Evidently Lindsey did not. Slowly the chastened girl resumed the punishment position, straightening her legs when told. Four more powerful smacks followed &#8211; each one harder than the last. Finally Miss Drake stopped and stood back. Lindsey was now crying quietly to herself and wriggling her intensely sore bum from side to side.

�Well, Lindsey. That concludes your punishment for arguing with me. I hope that you have learned your lesson and that your experience will prove a valuable example for the other girls here. But I warned you that putting a hand in the way would mean extra smacks. You have two more to come.�

With that the teacher rapidly delivered two final hard wallops with the slipper. The earlier smacks had alternated but these both landed on Lindsey&#8217;s right buttock and, judging from her anguished yells, clearly hurt like hell. Lindsey stayed bent over in position but at each impact her head shot upwards and her blonde hair flew wildly. Julie knew that the fifth former had brought her punishment on herself, but she was beginning to feel sorry for her. Like everybody else she still had her full punishment to come.

�All right, Lindsey. Stand up and return to your place.�

Lindsey stood up and her hand immediately went to rub her sore bottom. Julie could hardly believe it and she heard gasps from the other girls that indicated that they, too, were astonished.

Miss Drake grabbed Lindsey by her shoulders. �Lindsey! You&#8217;re in the A stream, but you seem to have difficulties with your memory! I said no rubbing! Right! Bend over again!�

Poor Lindsey turned to the angry teacher, her face screwed up. She mouthed the word �Please�, but it was no use. Very slowly she bent forward again, presenting her sore and tender bottom for further punishment.

Again the smacks came hard and fast, concentrating on Lindsey&#8217;s right bottom check. Each one evoked a yell, but she managed to stay in place. Four more whacks, meaning that she&#8217;d taken eighteen smacks on her bottom plus the one on the hand. This time when she was told to stand she stood shifting her weight from foot to foot and squirming in pain, but kept her hands well away from her punished bottom.

�Well, madam,� Miss Drake enquired sarcastically, �do you think that&#8217;s taught you not to rub yourself after punishment?�

Lindsey nodded, her lips pressed tightly closed.

�Well, I think it&#8217;s taught your bottom a lesson, but your hands still need to learn! Hold out your left hand!�

Lindsey had learned something at least. She didn&#8217;t argue with the teacher but obediently extended her left hand, palm up. Miss Drake adjusted its position until she was satisfied and then whipped the plimsoll down across the soft flesh of the school girl&#8217;s palm.

It didn&#8217;t sound as loud as the noise of the slipper cracking onto the girl&#8217;s tightly stretched trousers, but it obviously hurt &#8211; a lot. Lindsey waved her hand frantically and hopped from foot to foot. Miss Drake stood there impassively. �Other hand!�

Lindsey was very reluctant to hold out her right hand. It still throbbed from the smack it had received earlier. Eventually she did though and as soon as it was in position the gym mistress brought down her slipper again.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Julie thought that Lindsey&#8217;s punishment must be over now. But Miss Drake was not satisfied until both of the girl&#8217;s hands had felt another slipper blow. Finally the teacher let her wriggle her way back to her place, tears pouring from her eyes.

�Any other questions?�

Unsurprisingly there were none. Miss Drake positioned herself by the door to the gym and told the girls to start changing. Julie selected a pair of navy shorts from the fourth year equipment cabinet. The material seemed very thin, almost worn through in parts. Julie tried another pair, but they were just as bad. Unhappily, the schoolgirl wondered if the seat of the shorts had worn thin as a result of the numerous blows it must have felt over the years from slipper and cane! As she changed she noticed Lindsey Collins wincing as she pulled down her trousers and her knickers. The whole of the tall girl&#8217;s large bottom shone a bright red. Julie took a deep breath and concentrated on getting changed as quickly as possible.

One by one the girl&#8217;s, in full gym kit apart from their plimsolls, began to pass through into the gym and form a line where directed by the schoolmistress. Julie was fairly quick in changing and she found herself between Sarah Brookes and a younger, West Indian girl whom she didn&#8217;t know. In the middle of the gym she saw the large gym horse over which she knew they were to be punished. And in the far corner, opposite the door to the changing room, she could see a small trestle from which a large plimsoll, evidently the twin to that which Tracey and Lindsey had felt, and a long slender cane hung suspended. Before very long, Julie thought, one of those two implements would be whacked against her poor bottom. At the thought her hands crushed the red envelope in her dark hair as she suppressed their natural instinct to fly to her rear.

Lindsey was the last girl of all. She was obviously still feeling the effects of her slippering and she walked slowly and carefully to take her place at the end of the line. When all eleven girls were lined up Miss Drake addressed them once more.

�I shall deal with you in the order in which you reported to me. When I call your name you will come forward and hand me your envelope. I shall then tell you to bring me either the slipper or the cane. You will do so and then assume the punishment position across the horse. You will not leave that position until I tell you that you may do so. Is that understood?�

There was silence in reply. Miss Drake consulted her list. �Linda King, 2A!�

Out of the corner of her eye Julie saw a small girl move forward. She handed the envelope to the teacher, who opened it and examined the contents. �Fetch me the slipper, Linda,� she ordered, dropping the envelope and the note onto the floor of the gym. The girl began to walk towards the trestle but, on hearing Miss Drake&#8217;s �Faster girl!� broke into a trot. She returned and offered the plimsoll to the teacher.

�Over the horse, Linda!�

It took the girl some time to get into position over the gym equipment. Miss Drake made her reach right down the other side to grasp some hand holds. Julie saw that the blue gym shorts were stretched tight over the girl&#8217;s small bottom.

The teacher raised the plimsoll and took a step back. Julie realised that Linda could not know how many smacks she was going to get.

THWACKK!
The slipper came down at a terrific speed, the sound of it contact with Linda&#8217;s shorts echoing around the gymnasium. Julie realised that, despite the disparity in the girl&#8217;s ages, Miss Drake was using as much force with Linda as she had earlier used with Lindsey.

Bravely Linda remained silent after that smack and for the two following. But the fourth smack brought out a sharp yell of pain which was repeated more frantically as another two slipper smacks crashed into the girl&#8217;s smarting backside.

After six strokes the teacher stood back. Linda squirmed across the horse in obvious discomfort her bottom wriggling and her legs moving tremblingly.

�All right, Linda. You can get down.�

The little girl obeyed too quickly and in her hurry fell down &#8211; onto her sore bottom. She gasped in pain but, as she struggled to her feet, Julie saw that she was quick-witted enough to resist the temptation to rub her behind.

On the teacher&#8217;s instructions Linda returned the slipper to the trestle and scuttled back. Miss Drake then made her go over to one of the end of the wall bars and stretch herself right up as much as possible so as to grasp the highest bar she could. When she was satisfied with Linda&#8217;s position Miss Drake consulted her list again.

�Andrea Garner, 3B�

Andrea was the girl to Julie&#8217;s right. She went forward and offered her envelope to the teacher. Miss Drake stared at the naughty girl for a moment and then announced: �Right, Andre. This time it&#8217;s the cane for you!�

Julie saw how, just for a second, Andrea&#8217;s eyes widen in shock and her mouth had gaped open, but she soon recovered herself and went to bring back the cane.

Unlike Linda, Andrea had no difficulty in assuming the proper position over the horse. Julie guessed, correctly, that she&#8217;d been her before. Miss Drake whipped the cane through the air in practice strokes. Julie felt sick. It was horribly flexible and hissed like a nest of maddened wasps. Andrea&#8217;s bottom flexed as each stroke flailed the air. And then, with no further warning, the next time, Miss Drake landed the cane squarely across Andrea&#8217;s quivering bottom.

Andrea yelped and Julie saw her whole body shudder at the violent blow. Three more strokes followed and Julie was impressed to see Andrea take them bravely in silence. The teacher stood back after the fourth stroke had bitten home and told Andrea she could stand up.

Andrea walked very slowly when returning the cane to the trestle and when coming back afterwards. Several times she stopped and Julie felt, was on the point of grasping her hands to her bottom. Julie thought she was relieved when she was standing next to Linda, holding onto a wall bar. Still, Julie thought it was encouraging that the first caning she had witnessed had not reduced its victim to tears.

The next girl to be dealt with was Claire Williamson. Claire was in the same form as Andrea and had arrived with her. Claire, unlike the West Indian schoolgirl, was not a repeat offender and she was sent for the slipper, not the cane. However she was by no means let off lightly. Claire&#8217;s bottom received no fewer than twelve resounding slipper smacks from Miss Drake&#8217;s plimsoll and the fourteen year old was in tears well before the infliction was over.

Miss Drake was not satisfied when Claire stretched up to hold onto the wall bars after her slippering. She insisted on Claire grasping a higher bar, until the tips of her toes barely touched the gym floor, with her arms forced to take nearly all of her weight. When the gym mistress was finally happy with Claire&#8217;s position she walked slowly towards the bars and stood in front of Andrea.

�You were told to stretch up as high as you could, Claire. While you are here I expect you to do as you are told or to face the consequences! Now, hold on tight. This is going to sting!�

With that she administered two sharp slaps to the backs of Claire&#8217;s thighs below the blue gym shorts. The naughty teenager yelped at each slap and twisted frantically, but managed to retain her hold on the metal bar.

�I hope that the rest of you benefits from Claire&#8217;s experience. I expect you to hold on as high up as you can.�

As Miss Drake walked slowly back to the horse Julie saw the twin splotches of red spreading out on the pale flesh of Claire&#8217;s legs.

Julie wondered who was going to be next. It was Caroline Levy, the girl she had been so surprised to see there. As her name was called Caroline walked slowly forward and handed her envelope to the teacher. Julie was shocked when Miss Drake told her to fetch the cane. Once again she wondered what on earth Caroline could have done. She had hoped that Caroline would get the slipper. This was a bad omen for her.

As Caroline handed the cane to the teacher Julie saw that she was already crying quietly. Caroline had considerable difficulty getting into place over the horse. Miss Drake was not willing to wait and she encouraged the clumsy girl with a couple of hand slaps to her bare thighs. When Caroline was finally in place the teacher raised the cane and lashed it down onto to her flinching bottom. Julie winced sympathetically as her classmate howled in pain, her body bucking over the large horse. Like Andrea, Caroline received four strokes, but she did not take her punishment nearly as well as the younger girl. After the fourth whack Miss Drake instructed the caned girl to stand up, but Caroline remained wriggling over the horse, crying bitterly.
