Synopsis: Poor Caitlyn. No one told her that on Paradise Island running up an unpaid casino debt is a capitol offense. Nor did anyone mention the Islanders' bi-weekly feasts and the special role reserved for convicted females. Particularly beautiful young females. Now she's in deep, deep shit.HER LAST RESORT
by C. A. Smith &copy;2005 
Chapter 1: The Crime 
Jesus God Almighty! How did she get herself into such a fix? It can't be happening!
  Not one single soul had so much as whispered to her when she won this vacation
  trip that unpaid casino debt by tourists on Paradise Island is a capital crime!
  It certainly wasn't noted on their web site. Nor had anyone happened to mention
  that cannibalism can be sanctioned by the court for capital offenses on this
  godforsaken tropical island nation . Not her travel agent. Not her lover. No
  one. Not one fucking soul! Now she was in deep, deep shit! 
And there's not even a U.S. embassy! No one had mentioned that little fact,
  either. 
Okay, true. No one had recommended this place; she had decided on it all by
  her little blonde self. But it seemed so sensible at the time! She'd won the
  damned airline tickets and a week's free stay for herself and Kevin in the
  honeymoon suite at the Princess Xarnia Luxury Casino Resort and Health Spa
  with her winning essay on the subject: �Why My Lover and I Deserve a Vacation
  on idyllic Paradise Island.� Of course they weren't exactly on their honeymoon
  (since they weren't exactly married), but she'd bet most of the �honeymooners� who
  booked that suite were also one wedding shy of being married. Besides, she
  and Kevin had used every square inch of the bed, furniture, floor, shower and
  Jacuzzi to do what any madly-in-love, authentic, marriage certificate carrying,
  honeymooning couple would do. And then some. Which, if you looked at it in
  a certain way, made it okay. 
Then, as if a dozen orgasms the night before weren't enough, the next day
  in the Casino, Sunday, she actually came away four-hundred dollars richer than
  when she started! This had been the real attraction of Paradise Island, of
  course. She had been to Atlantic City and loved it! She'd spent three days
  on a casino cruise ship out of St. Thomas and hardly poked her nose out of
  the gaming rooms the whole time the ship floated in circles outside the three-mile
  limit. She had been to Las Vegas and had the time of her life! She loved the
  thrill of gambling and was good at it. True, she had maxed out her credit card
  in both Vegas and Atlantic City and had struggled to pay it off, but she'd
  come out three hundred dollars ahead on the gambling ship. She figured the
  tropical heat had something to do with her improved relations with Lady Luck. 
She wanted to cash in the chips, now, so she could enjoy holding the four
  hundred dollars in her hand, but Kevin talked her out of it. 
�Caitlyn, my sweet,� he cajoled, �think about it. We're going to be on Paradise
  Island for a week. What's the point of cashing them in now when we'll just
  turn them back into chips tomorrow so we can play some more? With your skill
  at blackjack, you can easily triple that in a couple more days. It's all a
  matter of confidence and persistence.� 
Right. She'd been plenty confident and persistent and look what happened!
  Ignorance and stupidity was more like it. She should have caught on that second
  night when her four-hundred dollar winnings had withered to twenty-five dollars.
  But she'd had a few really good payoffs along the way and was sure she was
  due for another biggie. Trouble was, they closed the Casino at two a.m. before
  it came. 
�It's just a matter of timing,� Kevin assured her in the elevator on their
  nine story upward journey to another night of frenetic, naked revelry. �You
  were just starting a really good roll there. Another few hands and you would've
  cleaned up! You've got a special aura, sweetheart. It attracts the good cards.
  We'll pick it up again tomorrow. You'll see. I've got a really good feeling
  about this!� 
And he gave her a really good feeling that night, too, beginning in the crowded
  elevator on the way to their room when he had the audacity to sneak his left
  hand under her mini skirt. They were up against the back wall so nobody noticed
  (she hoped) and she had no way to stop him without drawing attention to it.
  She was just plain helpless to keep his finger from sliding under her thong
  and up into that wet, sensitive place that had been itching for attention all
  day. She just bit her lower lip and concentrated on not moaning. They were
  the last ones in the elevator when it reached the ninth floor, so he felt no
  need to extract his wiggly finger as he marched her down the hall. She was
  just giddy enough (and just drunk enough from complimentary vodka screwdrivers)
  to let him, despite her desperate fear that someone would pop out of a door
  at any moment and catch them. To make matters worse (and more exciting) he
  slid his right hand down the front of her scoop-neck tropical halter, pushed
  down her barely adequate black lace bra and gently pinched her nipples as they
  walked to the door of the honeymoon suite. 
By the time they had closed it behind them, she was gasping at the brink of
  an orgasm and practically tore his clothes off to get at the remedy for her
  ache. She fondled and caressed it encouragingly as he took an outrageous amount
  of time to peel off her own skimpy apparel and lay her down on the king size
  bed. She writhed in delirious frustration as his tongue found every spot on
  her body that craved attention. He let her lick and suck the tip of his huge
  male sex toy while he did the same for her little female version. Then, using
  that same male appendage, now drenched with saliva, he traced a delightfully
  teasing path from her eyelashes, over her lips, across both nipples, around
  her navel and into the valley of her raging desire where it was suddenly swallowed
  by a very wet, very urgent and very greedy vagina that wouldn't let it go until
  it had surrendered a large cache of liquid assets. And that was only the beginning
  of the night's debauchery. 
Tuesday (which began at two thirty in the afternoon after a long soak in the
  Jacuzzi to relieve the soreness in their wonderfully abused sexual parts) Caitlyn
  and Kevin spent a little time at the indoor pool (where the chlorine stung
  her eyes and threatened her hair), a little time at the first class restaurant
  (where the food was a little too tempting) and a little time at the beach (where
  the sun was a little too hot and the air too humid). 
As they ambled along the hard wet sand where the tide was pulling back, they
  came to a high knoll covered with thick vegetation. A sign at the start of
  a foot path announced, �NUDE BEACH.� Kevin was eager to take a look. Giggling,
  Caitlyn let him lead her by the hand up over the knoll to the other side. The
  beach on this side was just as populated as the one they had left, but with
  two major differences. More than half the beachgoers were black � native islanders,
  Caitlyn assumed � and everyone was stark naked. Kevin urged her on but they
  were stopped by a uniformed policeman who told them no one was allowed on this
  portion of the beach while wearing any kind of clothing. �Okay,� Kevin said
  brightly. �Let's get rid of the suits.� Caitlyn was tempted, but balked. She
  told him she needed another day to work up her courage before she could get
  totally naked in public. He reminded her that the bikini she was wearing only
  covered a few square inches of skin. True enough, she agreed; but those few
  inches made all the difference to a girl. She promised him with a kiss, however,
  that tomorrow (with a deal of fortification from the bar) she would return
  with him and strip to the buff. �You're my witness,� he said to the policeman. �You
  heard her promise!� The man grinned and nodded. Finally Kevin led her back
  up over the knoll where they made a bee-line for the Casino to resume her roll. 
And roll she did! By about eleven o'clock she was five hundred dollars in
  the black and a card away from doubling it. But it turned out to be the wrong
  card. �Confidence! Persistence!� Kevin reminded her. So she soldiered on through
  a stomach churning night of good cards, bad cards, ups, downs, more downs and
  still more downs, until � when the closing bell rang � she was a little more
  than two thousand dollars in the red. 
Later that night Kevin did miraculous things with his tongue in all the right
  places, but somehow the half dozen orgasms he induced failed to lift her entirely
  from a darkening funk. She tried to take her mind off the financial hole she
  had dug by concentrating on increasing the girth of Kevin's love tool with
  her own well honed oral skills, but her attention to that tender task was niggled
  by a nasty inner voice reminding her that she had drained all her meager savings
  and was within a thousand dollars of blowing past her credit card limit. 
But Wednesday morning (well, one in the afternoon to be precise), Kevin reminded
  her that with four days left of their vacation there was plenty of time to
  get back on her roll and restore her credit and bank accounts. Confidence!
  Persistence! 
A long visit to the bar to drown the stubborn remnants of her modesty wasted
  just enough time for a tropical downpour to show up, giving Caitlyn a temporary
  reprieve from her promise to bare it all on the nude beach. She fully intended
  to fulfill her promise to Kevin and knew how silly this last scrap of modesty
  was, but nevertheless, she felt vastly relieved at the postponement. In fact,
  she took it as a sign that Lady Luck was once again in her corner. She was
  ready to return to her place in the winners circle! 
Sure enough, back at the Casino the cards started coming her way. By seven
  in the evening she had won back fifteen hundred dollars. Things were looking
  bright again! 
But somehow Lady Luck slipped out the back door when Caitlyn wasn't looking.
  By closing time Thursday morning she had lost it all again and a great deal
  more. In fact, the Casino Manager, an enormous black man with a large, affable
  smile and small, hard eyes regretted to inform her that her credit card debt
  had exceeded her limit. 
Shaken out of her gambler's daze (and the happy buzz of several free screwdrivers)
  by this unpleasant news, she turned to Kevin in boozy alarm. 
�Jesus, Kevin, I've run through all my money and now my credit card's maxed
  out. Where's yours?� 
�Where's my what, sweetie?� 
�Your fucking credit card, sweetie ! You heard the man. Mine won't
  work any more.� 
�I didn't bring my credit card with me on this trip. You said it was all paid
  for.� 
�The flight and the room and the drinks were paid for. Not the fucking chips!
  What do you have left for cash?� 
�Thirty dollars. Enough for breakfast tomorrow.� 
�Thirty dollars!� Her well hammered brain went into a fuzzy panic. �Jesus
  Christ, Kevin! Thirty dollars barely pays for a spam sandwich around here!
  And I can't win any money back without more chips!� 
The large Manager cleared his throat politely. �I'm afraid it's a more urgent
  problem than that, ma'am. You see, visitors who are not citizens of this country
  must clear all debts incurred in a casino before they are allowed to leave
  the premises. To do otherwise is a serious felony. You now owe the Casino .
  . .� He consulted a paper drawn from an inside pocket. �. . . four thousand
  seven hundred and sixty dollars, payable before you leave the Casino tonight.� 
�Before I leave the Casino?!!� Very little happiness remained in Caitlyn's
  vodka-based buzz. �How the hell am I gonna pay four thousand dollars before
  leaving the fucking Casino? I don't have two cents! Kevin! Help me here!� 
�I'm afraid I don't have it, either,� he reported sadly. 
�But he says they're gonna hold us here until we pay it!� 
�No ma'am,� the imposing Manager said through his very white teeth. �The debt
  is yours. You  will be the one detained. And it will not be here in
  the Casino. We do not have the facilities for that.� 
�Come on, Kevin,� Caitlyn said, jumping up from her chair at the blackjack
  table. �Let's go to our room and figure out how to get some money.� 
The Manager lifted a heavy hand into the air and made a slight beckoning signal
  with his index finger. �No ma'am, I'm afraid you will be detained elsewhere
  unless and until you have satisfied the debt.� Two equally burly black men
  in uniforms appeared at her side from out of nowhere. �Kindly put your hands
  behind your back, ma'am,� the Manager said blandly. 
�What?!� Caitlyn's indignant frustration turned swiftly to shock. 
�I said place your hands behind your back. It is necessary for the authorities
  to take you into custody until this matter is resolved.� 
�You can't . . . I won't . . . This isn't . . . Kevin!� she sputtered. 
But Kevin said nothing, did nothing, as one of the two burly men moved behind
  Caitlyn, took hold of her wrists, drew them behind her and snapped handcuffs
  over them. 
�Kevin!� she pleaded, �Do something! They're gonna put me in jail! Call someone!
  Your credit card company! My mother! The Ambassador! Don't just stand there,
  for chrissakes! Do something!� 
But he did just stand there. And they did take her away, her eyes afire with
  anger and fright. She had never been in a jail before. Not even a police station.
  Definitely not a jail in a tropical country filled with extremely poor black
  people who spent miserable lives groveling out a sub-poverty income serving
  rich, haughty white tourists. Like her. Her brain filled with stories she had
  read where innocent white female visitors to the third world were framed and
  sent off to a grim prison cell from which they were dragged daily into the
  head jailer's office and gang raped. 
The jail to which she was taken, as it turned out, was indeed pretty grim.
  But not for the reasons she had feared. She was not targeted by bitter and
  resentful natives for mayhem and abuse. She was not thrown into a filthy cell
  crammed with lice-covered, venereally infectious prostitutes and thieves. She
  was not dragged into the head jailer's office and savagely raped by sweaty
  guards calling her a worthless white whore bitch cunt. 
In fact, all the jail attendants � from the two gentle giants who brought
  her in, to the exquisitely polite desk sergeant who booked her, to the big-bodied
  courteous Matron who led her to her cell, were kind and gracious. 
�Now don't you worry, dear,� the Matron told her as she opened the steel door
  to the cell block, �you'll be just fine. Everyone here will treat you with
  respect, right up to your dispatch.� Caitlyn took �dispatch� to mean when Kevin
  got hold of the money to free her. 
She had hoped all the inmates would be asleep, it being two thirty in the
  morning, so she could slip into an empty bunk unnoticed, postponing the jailhouse
  horrors she had read about until morning. But as she and her entourage of Matron
  and guards started down the corridor, there was a rousing cheer! Behind the
  wall of bars on both sides was a sea of black faces � mostly men except for
  one large cell filled with women � smiling at her, nodding appreciably, taking
  in every inch of her long straight blond hair, lush white cleavage, slim shapely
  white limbs and flat white tummy fashionably exposed between her short halter
  and low-riding mini skirt. 
To her surprise, she was led to an open door near the far end of the corridor
  and put in her own private cell. It's furnishings consisted of a dirty, torn
  up plastic pallette and a truly filthy metal toilet with no seat. She could
  just make out in the dim light a tiny square barred window up near the ceiling.
  The burly guards removed her handcuffs and withdrew to just outside the cell
  door until the Matron had safely locked her in. 
�There's no blankets, dear,� the large woman said through the bars, �but you
  won't need any. Try to get some sleep. We'll see you in the morning and prepare
  you properly for the Magistrate.� 
Caitlyn was too shell shocked to reply. She stood in a helpless rage listening
  to the cadence of their feet retreating back down the corridor, followed by
  the solid clank of the cell block door and the shunk of its lock. She took
  stock of her surroundings: cinder block walls, cement floor and ceiling, iron
  bars, disgusting pallette, revolting toilet. Not even a sink. She sank cautiously
  to the pallette and burst into tears. It wasn't long before she became acutely
  aware of the torrid heat. No air conditioning for �detained� prisoners. She
  could hear a constant scrabble of cockroaches and other unseen vermin and smelled
  the fear-driven stench of her own heavily perspiring body. Eventually, out
  of sheer weariness, she managed to put her head down on the foul pallette and
wept herself into a sweat-drenched sleep.
Chapter 2. Detention 
The clambering noise of the cell block woke her up to an even more stifling
  heat as morning sun blazed through the tiny window. She had no idea what time
  it was. They had taken away her watch, jewelry and shoes. Her expensive Gucci
  shoes with the three inch heels! She hated to put her bare feet on this nasty
  floor that was undoubtedly a festering carpet of foot fungus, but she had no
  choice. She had to use the toilet. 
To her horror, she realized she would be in full view of any guard who happened
  by and looked in. But there was no help for it. Unwilling to let her body touch
  the incredibly filthy rim of the toilet, she spread her feet wide for balance
  and hovered just above it as she peed. Sure enough, guards emerged from nowhere
  to stare in at her through the cell bars, leering at the view between her legs.
  Torn between offering them this supremely lewd show or sitting on the sickening
  layers of dried piss and shit that coated the toilet rim (which would allow
  her to close her thighs), she opted to remain as she was, in her wide open,
  cunt agape straddle. 
Worse than the debasement of having to urinate in public was the dragging
  of time in which Kevin did not  show up to get her released. Where
  the hell was he? How hard can it be to call a friend or her mother to wire
  an emergency loan of four lousy grand? She'd only known Kevin for a few months,
  but he seemed responsible enough. Why the fuck would he leave his credit card
  behind on a trip out of the country? Could a man with such great looks � black
  hair, blue eyes, cleft chin, rock muscles, ramrod cock, the whole nine yards � be
  such a nitwit? Or � the thought added a hot dash of anger to her indignation � could
  he have been lying? Could it be that he had a card and just didn't want to
  use it? After all, he'd made no protest when they cuffed her and dragged her
  off. What was going on? 
Many more hours dragged by. The Matron returned with a cup of something to
  drink. It tasted dreadful! She refused to drink it. The Matron looked sad,
  but not surprised. She snapped her fingers and the two giant guards appeared
  in her cell, one with a device which he identified as a cattle prod. He demonstrated
  it on her bare thigh. They picked her up off the floor and assured her they
  would not use it again if she would be a good girl and drink the stuff in the
  cup. She did. Hurriedly! 
She spent the next several hours periodically rushing to the disgusting toilet
  to gush out every trace of last night's expensive meal in torrents of thick,
  chunky, liquified shit � each trip observed by a laughing, hooting audience.
  Eventually her intestinal distress calmed, but her anus had grown very sore.
  There was no toilet paper in the cell (and the Matron merely smiled when she
  asked for some) so she had been forced to use a corner of her own skirt to
  wipe herself. It was not only disgusting but totally inadequate. 
More hours crawled by. The cell grew dark. No less hot, humid and dank, but
  totally dark save for the low wattage naked bulb far down the corridor outside
  the bars of her cell door. She crawled on to the hard plastic pallette and
  wept herself to sleep for a second night as unseen vermin tippytoed around
  and over her. 

�I demand to make a phone call!� she demanded Friday morning when the Matron
  brought her another cup of the noxious drink. 
�Of course, dear. Drink up first.� 
�Do I have to?� she whined. �I haven't eaten real food since I got here and
  this stuff gives me diarrhea. Please don't make me.� 
�This is good for you, dear. Cleans you out. This is the last time you have
  to drink it, and then you'll be ready. You don't want to make these gentlemen
  use the cattle prod, do you, hon?� 
�No,� she moaned, and choked the wretched stuff down. �Now, please, take me
  to a phone. Please?� 
�Certainly, dear. Do you have money? It's a pay phone.� 
�No! Of course I don't. They took away my purse.� 
�Well, then, the phone won't do you any good, hon.� 
�No! I have a right . . .� Caitlyn began to shout, but stopped quickly as
  the burly man with the cattle prod moved toward her. Instead, she dissolved
  into the safer stratagem of weeping. 
�That's all right, dear,� the Matron said, patting her head. �It won't be
  long now. You get yourself all nice and cleaned out. We'll be back in a while
  to give you a nice bath.� 
Caitlyn had hardly been alone again before her bowels began calling her back
  to the toilet. As always, the male guards invariably showed up to watch and
  make lascivious remarks as she hovered there, skirt in hand as a wipe rag,
  spewing a soupy mess into the dirty bowl. This time there were no chunks; just
  slightly tinted watery effluent. 
Her growing hunger and thirst began to consume all her thoughts. She looked
  longingly at the water in the bowl. Why were they doing this to her? How could
  they treat an American citizen so cruelly who had done nothing worse than hand
  over to their damned casino every penny she owned plus everything she could
  borrow? And where was fucking Kevin?!! 
More hours. She listened to the prisoners down the block as they sang island
  songs interspersed with American rap lyrics chanted to rhythmic clapping. They
  laughed and exchanged dirty jokes across the aisle, apparently oblivious to
  the ferocious heat and lung-clogging humidity. In the farther distance she
  could hear a radio with rock music, probably coming from the head jailer's
  office, she decided, the place where she had not been dragged and raped (yet). 
Finally they came for her. 

The door to the cell block opened with a clang. She heard the voice of the
  Matron and the clatter of several feet. Her heart leaped with hope! Surely
  it was Kevin with the money to pay off her debt and get her out of here. She
  was at once overjoyed at the prospect of freedom and pissed off at Kevin for
  letting her rot so long in this moldy, superheated hellhole where vermin ran
  over her at night and the guards gawked while she shit and she had nothing
  to eat or drink but that goddawful chemical concoction that made her shit her
  guts out! And not a peep of encouragement from him through the whole ordeal! 
Then things took an even more ominous turn. 
For one thing the other prisoners in the block had gone utterly silent. That
  had never happened before. 
The Matron was the first to appear at the bars of her cell. Closely behind
  were the two burly men, one holding the cattle prod, the other a pair of handcuffs.
  Following them and forming an arc behind them in the corridor were four men
  she had never seen before: an older man with grey temples and tiny gold-framed
  glasses highlighting his dark face; a short, fat man with several chins and
  hands constantly kneading each other; a tall thin man with sad, sleepy eyes
  and clothes sized to expect another seventy pounds; and a brawny young man
  in a muscle shirt whose skin was so black is shone blue when the light struck
  him at a certain angle. 
The Matron unlocked the cell door and stepped in, followed by the two burly
  men. 
�Hold out your hands, dear,� the Matron said in her soothing, motherly tone. 
With a leery glance at the cattle prod, Caitlyn did as she was instructed.
  The handcuffs were snapped on to her small wrists and squeezed tight. At least
  her hands were in front of her this time, far more comfortable than behind
  her back. She forced herself to look on the bright side: there was probably
  a rule here, as in the States, that prisoners must be handcuffed during transit.
  That meant they were planning to take her somewhere. She prayed to the God
  she didn't believe in that it would be to where Kevin was waiting with the
  money to obtain her release. 
A terrible thought occurred to her. What if they had missed their flight back?
  How long would she be stuck on this horrible island? She vowed she would never
  set foot out of her hotel room again until it was time to board whatever flight
  they could arrange to get the hell out of here. 
�Come along, dear,� the Matron was saying. �We have to clean you up for your
  trial.� 
�My trial?!� Caitlyn shouted, her image of rescue shattering. 
�It's just a formality, dear. Don't worry your pretty head about it.� 
The man with the cattle prod grabbed her left elbow and propelled her forward
  through the cell door. She didn't resist. 
�Where is Kevin?� Caitlyn whined to the Matron's back as she was escorted
  down the eerily silent aisle. There were no faces watching this procession,
  she noticed. �This is a terrible mistake,� she pleaded. �Kevin will get the
  money and straighten it all out.� 
The Matron dropped back and fell in at her right side. �Kevin? Is he that
  handsome white boy with the black hair and blue eyes?� 
�Yes!� Caitlyn answered, nearly weeping with joy. At last she was getting
  somewhere! 
�I should have known,� the Matron said with a sidelong grin. �He brings in
  the most beautiful ones. They just can't resist him. And I don't blame them.
  If I was young and blonde, I'd volunteer. It'd be worth it for a month or two
  in the sack with him. You're a lucky girl.� 

Caitlyn had no idea what the woman was talking about, so she clarified the
  situation. �He's gonna borrow the money and get me outta this so I can go home!� 
The Matron gave her an appraising look. �You really don't know, do you honey?
  You ain't got a clue.� 
Dark terror was crowding out Caitlyn's flagging hopes. She decided the best
  way to sort out these scary obfuscations was to yell. �WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
  ABOUT?!� 
�Why do you think you're here, hon?� 
�I'm here because I won an essay contest. I wish to God I had lost it, now!� 
�Ain't no way you could have lost it, hon.� 
�What do you mean?� 
�Who told you about the contest, dear?� 
�Kevin. It was on the internet.� 
�And how hard do you think it is to put up a site on the internet, dear?� 
�What are you saying?� 
�Any fool trolling for innocent girls to lure to a tropical paradise can put
  an essay contest on the web, hon. Didn't you know that?� 
�But it was real! They paid our way here and for the honeymoon suite and everything!� 
�Course they did, hon. We always do.� 
We? This had to be a misunderstanding. This kindly and rather sizable black
  woman could not be saying that her  Kevin had tricked her into coming
  to this place with some kind of fake contest. Not the Kevin who for these two
  months has filled her days with romance, and her nights with outlandish orgasms
  (and often the days as well). That would be too cruel a twist. Before she could
  recover enough aplomb to point out this discrepancy, they had arrived at an
  ugly steel door which the Matron unlocked with a large key and pushed open. 
�In you go, dear.� 
Caitlyn was propelled through the doorway by one of the two burly men. It
  was a shower room with an ordinary cement floor centered by a drain. Six ordinary
  showerheads poked out of the far wall and an ordinary steel sink containing
  a bucket and a brush stood against another wall. Oddly, a hose tipped with
  a spray nozzle, the type used for lawns and gardens, hung from the ceiling
  a few feet from the center drain. In addition, two chains eight or ten feet
  apart hung down from the ceiling on either side of the center drain, each ending
  near the floor with one side of a pair of handcuffs. She supposed they were
  there to restrain prisoners while the door to the room was unlocked. 
The burly guard who had put her in handcuffs now used his key to unlock and
  remove them. At the same time she heard the steel door clank shut behind her.
  She heard the snick of the dead bolt sliding into place. 
�Now, dear, it's time for your bath,� the Matron said. �Take off your clothes.� 

Caitlyn was stunned. Could she have heard right? The two male guards were
  still standing right there! She glanced behind her; the other four men in her
  entourage were lined up in front of the door watching. No one showed the least
  inclination to leave the room. 
�Hurry now, dear. We're on a schedule,� the kindly black woman urged. 
�But . . . but . . . they're still here,� Caitlyn sputtered with an eye roll
  toward her audience. 
�Yes, hon. They're here to observe for their report. Hurry, now.� 
�Report? What report?� 
�For the trial, dear.� 
�But I can't get undressed in front of six strange men!� 
�Sure you can, hon. All our girls do. It's required by law. Of course, if
  you prefer, these two gentlemen . . .� she nodded toward her guards, �. . .
  will be happy to cut your clothes off for you. They actually enjoy that.� The
  guard with the handcuffs slipped a switchblade out of his pocket and snapped
  it open so Caitlyn could admire its razor sharp edge. �But it would be a shame
  to waste pretty clothes like yours. There are lots of girls on this island
  who would love to have them. They'd be snapped right up at our next church
  rummage sale.� 
Caitlyn was beginning to feel faint. She didn't like the implications she
  was catching in the woman's somewhat abstruse references. She couldn't bear
  the thought of stripping naked in front of a bunch of leering men. But she
  didn't like the way this smiling burly guard was holding that evil knife, and
  these were  expensive clothes � the mostly cotton, scoop-neck halter
  with the tropical floral print, the cute red mini with its tantalizing side
  slit, and her best Victoria's Secret black lace bra and thong � even though
  everything was soiled and smelly at this point. �Please,� she whimpered in
  a last ditch attempt to salvage what was left of her badly stressed dignity, �can't
  I have privacy for my shower? I mean with you here, of course.� 
A harder edge crept into the Matron's voice. �No. I told you, dear, the law
  requires that these gentlemen be present. It's for your own good. You don't
  want to be classified as sub-standard, do you?� 
Caitlyn had not the foggiest idea what she was talking about, but �sub-standard� did
  not sound like a good category to be in. �No,� she admitted in a barely audible,
  defeated voice. 
�So start undressing, dear, or we'll slice them off. Right now!� 

An image popped up in her mind of this huge man, in an excess of enthusiasm,
  accidentally slicing off a breast. It pushed her over the edge into the start
  of her very first public strip tease. She pulled the frail little halter up
  over her head and handed it to the Matron. That was easy. She unsnapped the
  top of her mini skirt, pushed it down her long legs and stepped out of it.
  That wasn't too bad, either. She had bathing suits almost as skimpy as what
  she was still wearing. Now came the first really hard part. She bit into her
  lower lip in a useless attempt to distract herself from her extreme embarrassment
  as she reached behind, unsnapped the little lace bra and slowly peeled it away
  from her breasts. Thank God her back was to the four new men, but the burly
  guards beside her made no attempt to hide their interest in her firm, well-proportioned
  tits, the nipples naughtily erect in response to an extremely unwelcome stirring
  in the place yet to be revealed. She wasted as much time as possible handing
  the flimsy bra to the Matron as she girded her mental loins for the final and
  most excruciating unveiling. Leaking tears, she subdued her sniffles by holding
  her breath and carefully pushed the tiny, nearly transparent thong away from
  where it was clinging to her very damp crotch and let it drop to her ankles.
  She could feel her face burning up as she stepped out of the little bundle
  of lace and bent over to pick it up, providing the audience behind her with
  an unimpeded view of her lovely round rump and a peek preview of the rosy lips
  between her legs which would soon be on much better display. 
The Matron accepted this final delicate garment and stepped out of the way
  as the two burly guards seized her elbows, turned her around and centered her
  over the drain. Now she was on full frontal exhibit for all six men. Somehow
  their appreciative grins helped lessen the extremity of her discomfort. She
  knew (although it wasn't couth to admit it) that she had an exceptionally beautiful
  body with slim shapely limbs, tiny waist, flat tummy, trim ankles and exactly-the-right-size-and-shape
  breasts. She was well aware that her boobs were large and firm enough to draw
  the eyes of every male in a fifty foot radius; large enough to fascinate every
  man who had ever been allowed a more intimate acquaintance with them; but not
  so large as to flop or hang like the droopy bags of some girls she knew. She
  could be confident that when she crawled on hands and knees over her lover's
  aroused body, or presented herself doggy style for his eager obelisk, her tits
  would remain firm and perfectly shaped. On the other hand, she found herself
  becoming painfully self-conscious about her cleanly shaved pussy. They were
  staring at it! Was it because they associated a hairless pubis with sluts and
  tramps? Or was it simply that they were indulging the typical male fascination
  with naked cunts? 
The Matron, having ditched the cast off clothing in the sink, arrived back
  at Caitlyn's right side holding one of the cuffs suspended from the ceiling
  by a chain. The guard on that side grabbed her right forearm and helpfully
  extended it toward the Matron who snapped the cuff over the proffered wrist.
  The Matron made sure it was locked, grunted with satisfaction and ambled over
  to the other cuff hanging from the chain on Caitlyn's left. She brought it
  back to her prisoner and when the guard presented Caitlyn's left arm to her,
  locked that cuff on as well. Now Caitlyn was tethered in place, her arms held
  out away from her body. No chance now of covering herself with her hands from
  the steady gaze of the six men. She was helpless to do anything but accept
  whatever they planned next. 
The Matron's next order doubled her humiliation. �Spread your legs, dear.
  Nice and wide.� 
The guard with the cattle prod brandished it in front of her face when she
  hesitated. Obediently, she separated her feet as far as she could, lewdly exposing
  her genitals. 

This was all in preparation, of course, for her �nice bath.� The Matron armed
  herself with the bucket and brush while the guard without the prod found a
  large wash cloth. The bucket turned out to be filled with soapy warm water
  which they thoroughly lathered all over Caitlyn's body. The guard apparently
  decided her boobs and labia were especially dirty because he spent an inordinate
  amount of time attending to them. He even had to use his bare hand to help
  work the lather into her fair skin and pink nipples. She had and urge to bite
  a finger while he was lathering her face, but the other guard was only a few
  menacing feet away tapping the cattle prod on the palm of his left hand (his
  finger carefully removed from the trigger). 
When the scrubbing stopped, Caitlyn dared not open her eyes lest the soap
  on her face get into her eyes. In a way, it was a blessing; she didn't have
  to watch her audience ogling her. She pressed her lips tightly together and
  waited for the hosing. Would it be hot or cold? She heard the water being turned
  on and a few seconds later a blast of cold water hit her in the belly, answering
  her question. She yipped, but ground her teeth and accepted the watery assault
  as stoically as she could. At least it wasn't scalding hot. In fact, after
  a minute it didn't feel cold at all. It was a huge relief from the murderous
  heat of this tropical torture pit. It was so wonderfully refreshing that she
  almost complained when it stopped; but when she opened her eyes, she changed
  her mind. There stood the gargantuan guard tapping his ever-ready prod, looking
  like he was just waiting for an excuse to use it. They left her dripping wet,
  which was almost as good, anyway. 
Now the lineup of men gaping at the spectacle of her helpless nudity began
  to move away from the wall, coming directly toward her. She swallowed and wondered
  if it would be okay to close her legs again. A glance at the vigilant guard
  with the prod told her not to risk it. She tried to look defiant, but it only
  came off as scared. 
�Come on, men, get on with your inspection!� the Matron said. �I've got to
  do her hair.� 
In a moment they were all over her, touching her where they shouldn't, squeezing
  her arms, tits, legs, butt. Running fingers into her. Tweaking her nipples.
  Examining her like a whore in a bordello. Or a slave on the auction block.
  My God! Was that it? Were these people white slavers who had tricked her into
  their lair? Her spirits sank several notches closer to despair, but she dared
  not say a word with that damned prod only inches away. 
�All right, men, you've seen enough.� The Matron was unlocking the steel door. �This
  is an open and shut case, so go get set up for the trial while I wash the poor
  girl's hair. It's a smelly mess. And such beautiful hair, too. She'll want
  it to be nice and clean and shining at her dispatch.� She made shooing gestures
  with her meaty hands and four of the men filed through the door, leaving only
  the two burly guards behind. 
While the Matron was locking the door again, the handcuff guard was releasing
  Caitlyn from her wrist restraints. The other guard dragged a salon chair from
  a far corner of the shower room and backed it up to the sink. Caitlyn was led
  to the chair and ordered to climb up into it. In short order she was handcuffed
  to the arms of the chair and tilted back so the Matron could sweep her long
  hair into the sink. What followed was a heavenly half hour of hair washing,
  toweling, combing, brushing and drying. 

�By the way, dear,� the Matron said as she ran a large comb through the blonde
  tresses, chased by the blow dryer, �how would you like your meat prepared:
  boiled or roasted?� 
The question was so out of the blue that Caitlyn didn't quite know how to
  respond. Until now they hadn't offered her anything to eat or drink except
  that dreadful milky stuff that gave her the major runs. She was glad they were
  finally getting around to it because she was starved and dehydrated. The fact
  that they were giving her a menu choice was a pleasant surprise. 
�I don't know that I've ever had boiled meat,� she said, wrinkling her brow, �except
  maybe in stews, but even that was cooked first, I think. But I do know I like
  roasts, so I'll go with roasted.� 
�I'm so glad, my dear. That's my favorite way, too. I'll be sure to tell the
  cook.� 
This was certainly an unusual jail, she thought. First they throw you in an
  abysmal cell and starve you, then they make you strip naked in front of a bunch
  of men and string you up so they can molest you, then they give you a lovely
  shampoo and a choice of boiled or roasted meat. Weird! But at least they were
  finally planning to feed her. As she pondered these mysteries, one of the guards
  sauntered over with a pair of leg irons and locked them on her ankles. The
  chain between the cuffs was only about a foot long. For God's sake, just how
  dangerous a desperado did they think she was? she wondered. It's just a damned
  unpaid bill and she'd pay it if they let her use the fucking phone! Her mother
  would loan her the money. She'd done it before. It would be worth the inevitable
  barrage of lectures she'd get about her reckless gambling and fornicating with
  a man she'd only known for two months. She studied the sweet face of the Matron
  and decided to make one more appeal to her motherly nature and sense of rightness. 
�Please,� she purred, �there must be a way I can use a phone. I'll call collect.
  I can pay the casino the money I owe them if I can just use the phone to arrange
  it.� 
�Foreigners with gambling debts must use the pay phone, dear. It's the law.
  You need fifty cents to reach the operator for a collect call. Doesn't look
  like you have it, hon.� 
�But I do! I do have it! It's in my purse. You must have my purse here somewhere.� 
�All we have is what you were wearing, dear. No purse.� 
�Then Kevin must have it back at the hotel. Call him! Tell him to get his
  ass down here with my purse.� 
The Matron chuckled. �Ain't no way that boy is gonna bring you your purse.
  Besides, it's against the rules. I can't call for you. Prisoners have to make
  their own phone calls.� 
Caitlyn wanted to scream in frustration! �I need a lawyer. If I'm going to
  have a trial, I need a lawyer. Someone has to call me a lawyer.� 
�Okay, dear. You're a lawyer.� The Matron giggled at her wit as she put down
  the comb and dryer. 

�I'm serious!� Caitlyn was  screaming now, which swiftly gained the
  attention of the guard with the prod. At the sight of his swift approach, Caitlyn
  shrank back in the chair, eyes wide with fear. �I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!� she
  pleaded. �Please don't use that! I'll be good! I promise. Please, please, please!!� 
Her terrified contrition seemed to appease the guard because he stopped beside
  her without zapping her with the diabolical device. 
�All right, dear, time to get out of the chair,� the Matron said. 
The second guard unlocked her from the chair and helped her to her feet. She
  shied away from the altogether too close cattle prod, her steps now reduced
  to a shuffle thanks to the leg shackles. She relaxed only when she was certain
  she had escaped it's fiery touch. There was no mirror, but she could see as
  she straightened up again that the hair flowing down over her tanned shoulders
  was back to its soft, golden glory. 
The guard drew her hands behind her back, cuffed her wrists and pulled her
  over to an old fashioned weighing scale with a rusty slide and weights. The
  Matron was waiting there with a clipboard. 
�All right, dear, step on the scale,� she said. 
A physical, too? Caitlyn was thinking. 
The Matron fiddled with the weights until the beam balanced. �One hundred
  sixteen pounds,� she announced, and made a notation on the clipboard. The machine
  also included a device for measuring height. She settled the horizontal bar
  on the top of Caitlyn's head and made another notation. �Five feet, three inches.
  Your age, dear.� 
�Twenty two.� 
She wrote it down. �You're perfect!� From a locker next to the weight/height
  machine she retrieved a white terrycloth robe which she wrapped around Caitlyn's
  shoulders. Actually, it wasn't a robe at all; it was a cloak. No sleeves. It
  was held together in front by a single frog at the neck. She looked her charge
  over with a satisfied smile. �All right, dear, time to attend your trial.� 
�But I need a lawyer,� Caitlyn murmured meekly. �Please,� she added, eyeing
  the cattle prod. 
�Hon, unless you can magically come up with fifty cents for that phone call,
  you gotta be your own lawyer.� 
�Can't you please loan me fifty cents? Please!� 
�No, dear. It's against regulations. But don't you fret. A lawyer won't make
  no difference. This case is open and shut.� 
That was the second time she'd said that. Caitlyn definitely didn't like the
  sound of it. Furthermore, Kevin's continued failure to show up and rescue her
  was making the Matron's chilling intimation that he had actually tricked her
  into this situation seem more and more plausible. But what was the point? They
  weren't giving her a chance to pay the debt. Could it be she really was in
  the hands of white slavers? But that didn't make seem right, either. This was
  a real jail and these people wore official uniforms and badges and everything. 
So when the Matron said, �Come on, dear, the Magistrate is waiting,� and they
  started to march her toward the door, she panicked! 
�Wait!� she squealed. �I'm not dressed.� 

�Of course you are, dear,� the Matron replied as she unlocked the door. �You
  look lovely. Hush now. You don't want another touch from that nasty old cattle
  prod, do you.� It was a statement, not a question. And it was true. 
Mortified, wishing she could just pass out and be spared this unspeakable
  humiliation, Caitlyn was led down the aisle between the cells once more, her
  inadequately fastened cloak gaping open as she shuffled along. This time, once
  again, the bars of the cells were filled with huge white smiles on dark faces
  taking in the peep show with a cacophony of cheers, explicit suggestions and
  obscene compliments. 
Chapter 3: Trial 
She could hardly breathe by the time they reached a door marked �Office.� O
  God, she thought! This is where I get gang raped! They've probably been inviting
  all their friends to come get a piece of their new little blonde prisoner with
  the big boobs! Well, all right; medium sized boobs. But nice ones. 
The Matron opened the door and Caitlyn was ushered in on rubbery legs. What
  she saw didn't look at all like the setting for a sleazy rape scene. There
  were the same four guys who had ogled her in the shower room, plus two more,
  one of them the Casino manager. They were all sitting behind a long teakwood
  desk ogling her again, and obviously pleased with what they saw. The tall man
  with the sleepy eyes sat in the middle dressed in a black robe and wearing
  an absurd white wig. He was holding a gavel which he struck three times on
  the desk. What she did not  see was Kevin and any hope of a happy
  ending to this �trial.� 
One of the two new strange men intoned pontifically, �This court is now in
  session, the honorable Magistrate Clifford Mbona presiding. The accused will
  stand in the dock and will respond to all questions, addressing the Magistrate
  as �Your Grace'.� 
Caitlyn was escorted to a four-by-four patch of wooden flooring resting atop
  the ubiquitous cement directly in front of the robed, sad-eyed man who was
  tall even seated in his place. The dock was fenced in on three sides by a low
  wooden railing. The two guards stood just behind and to each side of her. She
  was trembling both in suppressed anger and a feeling of helpless fear, but
  tried not to show it. 
�Are you Caitlyn West of Cincinnati, Ohio, United States of America?� he asked,
  reading off some papers in front of him. 
�Yes, Your Grace.� 
�And were you lodged in the so-called honeymoon suite of the Princess Xarnia
  Luxury Casino Resort and Health Spa as of last Saturday?� 
�Yes, Your Grace, along with . . .� 
�And did you gamble in the Casino associated with that resort, Ms West?� 
�Yes, Your Grace, but I . . .� 
�And did you run up a debt you could not repay?� 
�That's not right! I would have paid it if . . .AAAAH!� She leaped to the
  left, collided with the railing and crumpled to the floor clutching her right
  buttock and squirming in pain and issuing little yips. �Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
  . . .� After several entertaining seconds, the two guards lifted her to her
  feet and planted her in the center of the dock again, facing the Magistrate.
  She hunched down, rubbing her bottom and whimpering. 
�You must answer with yes  or no , Ms West, unless I ask
  for a detailed answer. Any further outbursts from you will result in a much
  harsher use of the cattle prod. Is that clearly understood, Ms West?� 
�Yes, Your Grace,� she sniffled. 

�Then I will ask you again. Did you run up a gambling debt to the Casino that
  you could not pay, Ms West? Yes or no.� 
�Yes, Your Grace,� she replied, biting her tongue and keeping an eye on the
  prod for any threatening moves in her direction. 
�Mr. Combstock, you are the manager of the Princess Xarnia Luxury Resort and
  Health Spa's Casino, are you not?� 
�Yes, Your Grace,� said the man at the far end of the table who had started
  this horrible ball rolling. 
�And you are the one who filed the complaint against the accused, is that
  correct?� 
�Yes, Your Grace.� 
This is outrageous! Caitlyn was thinking. She's forced to stand here
  with her pussy showing, in handcuffs and without a lawyer while her accuser
  sits on the bench with the judge! What kind of trial is this?! 
�Would you kindly inform the court of the circumstances and extent of Ms West's
  indebtedness to the casino.� 
�Certainly, Your Grace. Ms West arrived in the Casino Saturday night and began
  the evening by working the mid-level slot machines. She won one hundred twenty
  . . .� 
�Yes, yes. You've documented all her winnings and losings very thoroughly
  right here.� The Magistrate waved a sheaf of papers over his head. �Just get
  to the bottom line, Mr. Combstock. Why is she here? What is your compliant?� 
�We all know why she's here,� the manager sniggered. 
�None of that!� snapped the Magistrate. �I've told you before, these matters
  must be carried out formally, legally and with decorum. Now, state your complaint.� 
�Very well, Your Grace. By closing time Thursday morning Ms West had run up
  a gambling tab of four thousand, three hundred and sixty dollars, U.S. and
  attempted to pay it off with a worthless credit card.� 
Caitlyn nearly screamed an objection, but she'd had quite enough of that cattle
  prod. 
�Worthless, Mr. Combstock?� said the Magistrate. 
�It was overdrawn, Your Grace.� 
�That's what I thought. There's no point in impugning the character of the
  Accused beyond her actual crime.� He lifted a document to where the manager
  could see it. �Is this the official notification from her credit card company
  of insufficient funds?� 
�Yes, Your Grace.� 
�Is this your account, Ms West?� He handed it to one of the guards who showed
  it to Caitlyn. 
�Yes, Your Grace.� She wanted to say more but clamped her mouth shut. 
�Very well. I'm ready to issue my verdict. I find the accused, Caitlyn West,
  guilty as charged. To wit, failure to pay her casino gambling debt in a timely
  manner as is required by law for a foreign national. I'm now ready to pronounce
  sentence. Are you ready to receive it, Ms. West?� 
�Your Grace, Sir,� Caitlyn whispered, glancing nervously at the prod, �may
  I be allowed to defend myself, Sir? Your Grace.� 

�No. There is no need. The evidence is absolutely clear and I have already
  issued the verdict. You may hear your sentence now, or you may return to your
  cell for a few minutes so these gentlemen can bring you to your senses. Which
  shall it be? Are you ready?� 
She swallowed. Surely there must be some way to appeal this later. She certainly
  was not about to argue her case with a cattle prod. �I'm ready, Your Grace.� 
�The penalty for this crime is mandatory. I therefore sentence you, Caitlyn
  West, to be taken to the Dispatch Center at once, there to be put to death
  in the manner prescribed by the laws of Paradise Island; after which your carcass
  is to be cooked in accordance with your stated preference � which is to say
  . . .� (he consulted his papers) �. . . roasted � and served tonight at the
  Luana Beach Bi-Weekly Festival. This court is adjourned.� He slammed the gavel
  down hard and all the men at the desk rose as one. 
Caitlyn swayed, the world swirling out of control. The two guards, ready for
  it, grabbed her arms and carried her to a waiting chair. The Matron was right
  there with a helpful dose of smelling salts to buck her up. 
�Now, now, my dear,� she soothed, �it won't be all that bad. You'll see.� 
Chapter 4: Punishment 
Caitlyn struggled to keep her thoughts lucid as she was led out of the jail,
  across a strip of black parking lot pavement the temperature of a frying pan
  over low heat and up a ramp into the back of a van the size of a truncated
  bus. That her cloak flapped wide open as she shuffled along in her clanking
  shackles was the least of her concerns now. Jesus God Almighty! How had she
  gotten into such a fix? Where was that bastard Kevin? Did he know that the
  penalty for running up a gambling debt here was death? Worse: that they cook
  and eat the condemned! 
The prisoner compartment of the van had two benches running along each side.
  The Matron nudged Caitlyn forward and told her to sit on the right, up against
  a wire mesh screen separating the prisoners and guards from the driver. 
�Are they really going to kill me?� Caitlyn asked, her voice trembling with
  the terror simmering in her empty bowels. 
�Oh certainly, dear. That's the law.� 
�But I can pay them back if they'll just let me!� 
�Too late for that, dear. This is why you were brought here.� 
�Brought here?� 
�Yes, by that lovely blue-eyed boy.� 
�Kevin really did this?! He let me come here knowing I'd run up a bill and
  be sentenced to death?� 
�Of course. And he certainly outdid himself this time. You'll be the loveliest
  girl we've cooked in months. Everyone will be so pleased.� 
�All the time he was making love to me he was planning this?� 
�Oh probably long before that, dear. He usually spots his girls in casinos
  and if they're pretty and unattached, he finds a way to meet them. Then it's
  all over. What normal girl can resist a spectacular hunk like that?� 
�Well I sure didn't! But how can he do that? It's horrible!� 
�For money, dear. We pay him a nice fee for each girl.� 
�He betrayed me for money?!!� 
�And because he enjoys girl meat.� 
�That's worse! He sold me for meat!� 
�Oh no, dear. We just paid him to bring you here. You were the one who broke
  the law. You committed a capital offense, dear, so it's out of our hands, now.� 

A clanking of chains on the ramp drew Caitlyn's attention. To her amazement
  two more female prisoners were being led and pushed into the van, each accompanied
  by a Matron in a uniform identical to her own Matron. The two prisoners were
  shackled and cloaked the same way she was, except for the colors. The youngest
  girl � she could not have been out of her teens � had dark brown hair that
  fell straight to the center of her back. She had a deep tan, the kind of sexy
  puffy lips that movie actresses pay big bucks to acquire and huge brown utterly
  terrified eyes. She was draped in a burgundy cloak. The other woman was equally
  attractive in a more mature way and looked remarkably like her, except for
  lighter, auburn-tinted hair, a much larger bosom that the flapping cloak could
  not contain and a grimly set mouth. Her cloak was a royal blue. She sat with
  her Matron on the same side as Caitlyn. The younger girl sat across the aisle. 
�Who are these?� Caitlyn whispered to her own Matron. 
�The other two convicts for tonight's banquet. We always have three.� 
�Three?!� 
�Certainly, dear. These festivals are very popular. There'll be hundreds there.
  You couldn't feed them all just by yourself.� 
Until now Caitlyn had assumed she was all alone in this deadly dilemma. �Did
  they just have their own trials, too?� 
�No. They were convicted last week. We've been holding them in another cell
  block. It's quite a touching story, actually. Would you like to hear it, dear?� 
�Should we be talking like this right in front of them?� 
�Shortly they'll just be meat, dear. What difference does it make?� 
Caitlyn shuddered. Shortly she would be meat, too. �None, I guess.� 
�They're actually mother and daughter. The girl, Alissa, is sixteen, the same
  age her mother was when she had her. Her Mom, Danielle, is thirty-two. Anyway,
  Mom went off to do some sightseeing and left daughter Alissa to do a little
  gambling. She gave her a casino voucher, too, with strict orders not to charge
  more than five hundred dollars. Well, Alissa took advantage of her freedom
  to buy some drinks and soon got so hammered that she lost track of her tab
  and ended up charging over three thousand dollars. Mom could only cover twenty-five
  hundred of it, so Alissa was arrested, convicted and sentenced to death. The
  girl was devastated and terrified, of course; so her mother, realizing that
  it was all her fault for leaving a naive young girl where she could get drunk
  and run up an impossible bill, decided she owed it to her to stay with her
  to the end, and the only way she could do that was to get herself convicted.
  So she ran up her own unpayable tab and now they can die together.� 
�That's awful,� said Caitlyn, remembering that the hotel brochure had listed
  the legal age for women to drink and gamble in a casino as sixteen. Now she
  knew why. 
�I think it's sweet,� said the matron. 
�Did they get to share the same cell while they waited for . . . for today?� 
�No. Unfortunately, regulations require condemned females be kept in separate
  cells. This is the first they've seen each other since their arrests and I
  think Mom has decided she made a big mistake.� 
Four burly guards, including the two that were assigned to Caitlyn, were the
  last to climb into the van. They slammed the double doors. The temperature
  inside the already hot passenger compartment instantly rose by thirty sweaty
  degrees. The van rumbled into life and lurched forward. 
There were no windows on the sides and back. The only light and air came from
  the driver's compartment. Caitlyn stared at the floor. She didn't want to see
  where they were going. But the thoughts that churned out of the silence became
  unbearable. 

�They're really going to eat us?� 
�Of course, dear. It's tradition. The festivals are every other week and they're
  very popular.� 
�And he's going to be there? Kevin?� 
�Of course, dear. He always stays for the banquet. The providers always get
  a slice of the tit meat and a nipple. Those are the best parts.� 
�I can't believe this is happening.� 
�It's an honor, dear.� 
�An honor?! In that case, why don't YOU volunteer?� 
She laughed. �I'm too old and fat, hon, or I would. They like the pretty young
  girls.� 
�Why? You'd provide more meat.� 
�Not really. When you cut away all the fat, there's no more of me than there
  is of you, and you'll look so much more beautiful on the spit or in the pot.
  But when I was young . . . ah! That was a different story.� 
�So why didn't you volunteer then?� 
�I did! When I was sixteen. The same age as Alissa. I was a heartbreaker back
  then. I didn't have your wonderful yellow hair, but my tits were bigger and
  just as firm. The boys were always trying to get into my pants. Some did.� She
  giggled. 
�But you're still here!� 
�Yes. The girl I was to replace became available after all.� 
�What do you mean?� 
�Mostly we use foreign white and Asian girls because they look so exotic when
  they're cooked and are really tender. But if a foreign girl fails to run up
  a casino debt so she can be legally condemned, we substitute a local volunteer.
  There's always a waiting list and I was at the top of the list. I was really
  excited when they called me and ready to be spitted, but at the last minute
  the white girl went over her credit card limit by fifty dollars, so I was set
  aside. By the time another opportunity came along I was pregnant with my first
  baby and ineligible.� 
�You really wanted to be killed and eaten?� 
�I'd love to be in your place right now, dear, but it's not to be. I live
  out my dream through the girls I bring to the Dispatch.� 
�And you say there's even a waiting list?� 
�Always.� 
�Why would a young girl want to be on a death list?� 
�It's exciting! You're honored by the whole island. All your friends and relations
  come to see you off and share your meat. Besides, they pay you for every month
  you're on the list.� 
�But I don't want to die!� Caitlyn wailed. 

�Of course you don't, hon. I didn't, either. But that's part of the excitement,
  both for you and the crowd. Who cares if an old cow like me is slaughtered
  and cooked? But when they lay eyes on you � young and lithe and lovely � it
  will be exquisitely painful to watch you die, which will make eating you a
  wonderfully sensuous experience. It's a tremendous rush!� 
�No it isn't! I don't want to be eaten!� 
The Matron patted her knee. �It won't hurt, dear. You really impressed the
  Magistrate and the Cook. You're slated to go first. You get to choose how you'll
  be snuffed.� 
�I don't want to go first!� Caitlyn wailed. �I want to go home!� She broke
  into soft sobs. 
�You are  home, dear. This is where your bones will stay forever.
  Even the ones they use for soup.� 
Caitlyn wailed louder. 
�You need to pull yourself together, dear, and start thinking about your choices.
  We'll be at the Dispatch Center in a minute.� 
�What choices?� Caitlyn blubbered. 
�How you want to be dispatched. You can make it quick, or slow, or decide
  to be cooked alive.� 
�Cooked alive?! What kind of a choice is that?� 
�It's the best. That's what I had chosen, before they set me aside.� 
�O God!� 
�You've already selected roasting as your preferred way of being cooked.� 
�No I haven't! When did I do that?� 
�I asked you, remember? You said you liked your meat roasted.� 
�I didn't mean ME!� 
�You, someone else . . . it's all the same. You said you preferred your meat
  roasted, so that's what they're planning to do. Personally, I think it's a
  great choice. You'll be absolutely delicious roasted. I can hardly wait.� 
�YOU'RE going to eat me, too?!� 
�Of course, dear. I've been looking forward to it since I first laid eyes
  on you.� 
�This was all just a setup, then, wasn't it? That wasn't really a trial. It
  was just part of the scam.� 
�Oh no. It was quite legal. We always stay within the letter of the law.� 
�But the verdict was a foregone conclusion. And the sentence. I was doomed
  from the moment I set foot on the island.� 
�Not necessarily. If you hadn't run up a debt you couldn't pay . . .� 
�But dear old Kevin made sure that I did! Has any �provided' girl ever walked
  away from here?� 
�Oh certainly. But they always come back.� 
�Why on earth would they come back?� 
�Because if they don't lose in time to be condemned, we make sure they're
  big winners. They can't resist coming back to do it again.� 
�So once a girl is lured here, she will eventually be meat, no matter what.� 
�Exactly. How lucky you are, dear, to have won that honor the first time around.� 

At that point the van jerked to a stop. Caitlyn's eyes filled with terror. 
�Now don't you worry,� the Matron said, patting her knee. �I'll be right beside
  you the whole time. It will be easy as pie.� 
�Please don't let them kill me!� Caitlyn blurted. �There must be something
  you can do!� 
But the guards had opened the doors, climbed out of the van and were setting
  up the ramp. One by one the three prisoners were off-loaded and made to stand
  on the hot gravel until the van was empty, shut and driven off. 
A huge stage the length and height of a ranch house loomed in front of them.
  Through its concrete supporting legs Caitlyn could see the front ranks of a
  vast throng of people gawking back at them from the other side. A deep male
  voice suddenly erupted from an enormous pair of loudspeakers. 
�Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Island Dispatch Center and our bi-weekly
  Luana Beach Festival! Our convicts have arrived and the show is about to begin.
  This is shaping up to be a fine day and fabulous evening for all of us. We
  have three beautiful young ladies to dispatch and I know they're gonna give
  you great performances. If you haven't already purchased tickets for the feast
  tonight, you'd better do so right away. There's lots of us and only three of
  them.� He chuckled and the crowd made appreciative but impatient noises. �Are
  you ready?� the unseen voice shouted. 
A giant cheer went up from the crowd! 
�Then here we go! Bring up our first convict, gentlemen.� 
The mother, her hands trembling visibly threw a quick, accusatory glance at
  her hyperventilating daughter as she was hustled up a long flight of very shallow
  stairs on the left side of the stage. The steps were shallow enough for the
  prisoners to navigate in spite of the twelve-inch chain connecting their ankle
  cuffs. When she reached the top another cheer went up from the crowd. Her attending
  Matron followed closely behind her. Caitlyn, who had edged somewhat under the
  stage to take advantage of its shade from the blistering sun, lost sight of
  them just as another, louder cheer went up. 
�This is Danielle,� the voice went on. �She's five foot seven, one hundred
  forty delectable pounds and still in her tastiest prime at thirty-two. Turn
  around, Danielle, so the folks can appreciate what they'll be biting into tonight.
  Turn slowly, now.� A minute went by with nothing more from the announcer but
  a groundswell of mostly obscene remarks from the audience. �Nicely done, Danielle.
  Now go stand over by your robe while we bring up the next young convict. Gentlemen?� 
The girl Alissa, now openly weeping, was hustled to the foot of the stairs
  and up to where Caitlyn could no longer see her. The crowd greeted her appearance
  with a solid cheer. 

�This is the pretty Alissa, who is, by the way, the daughter of Danielle.
  It's a rare treat to have a mother�daughter combination to dispatch and cook,
  especially when they are both so beautiful. Take a look!� Suddenly the crowd
  erupted in a great cheer, much louder than any before. �Sensational isn't she?
  This lovely creature is sweet sixteen � and I know she's going to be as sweet
  on the plate as she is to look at!� A roar of agreement. �She stands five foot
  eight, weighs in at one hundred twenty nine pounds and is a genuine, certified
  virgin! The gods will be happy tonight!� Much laughter from the crowd. �Now
  then, Alissa, your tears are most charming, but the good folks who are going
  to dine on you tonight want to see more of your lissome young body, so give
  us a nice slow turn. Come now, you don't need encouragement from the guards,
  do you? No, I thought not. Go ahead, then.� Another long clamourous roar from
  the crowd filled the announcer's gap. �That very nice, Alissa. Very sexy. Now
  go with the Matron and stand by your robe.� 
Caitlyn's heart threatened to pound its way out of her chest as two guards
  grabbed her arms and moved her toward the stairs. 
�And last, but far from least, is our star felon for today's festival. Bring
  her up, men!� 
She hardly felt the wooden steps under her bare feet as the guards rushed
  her upwards, her leg irons clinking on the risers, her cloak flapping open
  as her knees knocked them aside. She kept her eyes down so she wouldn't stumble,
  raising them only when she reached the top. What she saw staggered her. A sea
  of mostly black faces staring up at her expectantly, separated from the vivid
  blue of the ocean behind them by a wide expanse of gorgeous white beach. The
  same beach she and Kevin had explored between fevered bouts of sexual frenzy
  and long hours of fateful gambling in the Casino. She spotted several white
  faces among the hundreds and studied each one. Sure enough, there he was. Smiling
  up at her! Here to watch her die before pitching in to eat her later! �This,
  ladies and gents, is the lovely Caitlyn, condemned just this morning and rushed
  here for our ultimate enjoyment. She's a petite five foot three, weighs in
  at a cuddly one hundred fifteen pounds and is at the perfect age of twenty-two:
  young enough to be tender and succulent, old enough for maximum flavor. And
  not only that, wait'll you get a load of this.� 
The Matron's voice from behind her murmured, �Be proud, now, honey. We're
  gonna show them how exquisite you are.� With that she unhooked the one clasp
  holding the cloak together and slipped it off. 
Caitlyn gasped in horror, barely aware of the huge cheer that went up from
  the crowd. She was stark naked in front of hundreds of gawking men, women and
  children. She thought her heart would stop. But it didn't. 
A prolonged, throaty cheer went up. �As you can see, she's adorable. Truly
  lovely! Look at those perfect tits, that wasp waist and firm tummy, those elegantly
  tapered legs! And that spectacular blond hair! As a result of her beauty and
  cooperation with the criminal justice system, she has been granted first choice
  this afternoon for dispatch and cooking. Turn around, my dear, and let your
  admirers see how truly blessed we are today that you have been delivered to
  us.� 
The Matron spoke in her ear. �Turn around slowly, hon, or the boys will use
  the cattle prod on you. You don't want that, dear, in front of all these people.
  Turn all the way around now. Nice and slow.� 

Caitlyn did as she was told. What was the point of inviting the terrible pain
  of the cattle prod if they were just going to kill her anyway? She turned slowly
  so that the appreciative crowd could ogle every part of her nude body. But
  she couldn't prevent her eyes from welling up with the tears of her humiliation
  and fear. As she turned she saw Danielle standing at the back of the stage,
  her own cloak a little pile at her feet. Several feet away her daughter stood,
  equally naked and sobbing. 
�Wow! What a superb body!� the loudspeakers said. �I don't know about you,
  but I can hardly wait to sink my teeth into a slice of that!� More cheering. �Festival
  goers, you'll be delighted to learn that Caitlyn has elected to be roasted.� Another
  cheer! �Now, Caitlyn, it's time to make your choice of dispatch so our Cook
  can get to work turning you into a memorable dining experience.� 
The guards seized her bare arms and forced her to the right side of the stage
  in a fast, clanking shuffle where an ominous trio of frightening equipment
  waited. The first was a heavy, angled blade suspended in a frame. Caitlyn didn't
  need any help figuring out what that  was. 
�If you're looking for a quick, probably painless way to be snuffed, the guillotine
  is the ticket. Most heads remain alive three to five seconds after being severed.
  A girl gets to see what her body looks like with her head freshly chopped off.
  On the other hand . . .� 
The guards urged her further along to a noose dangling from a scaffold. �.
  . . if you'd rather not go out in a spray of gore, you could create a lovely
  death scene with slow hanging. It usually takes about twenty minutes and is
  wonderfully entertaining for us to watch. We simply loop the noose around your
  neck, pull you up gently to the tips of your toes and watch you dance while
  you struggle to breathe. Some girls actually get off on it before they die.� 
They pushed her to an evil looking contraption at the far end of the platform. �Now
  this is the Cadillac of dispatch methodology. If you want to give yourself  a
  real treat as well as us, this is the way to go. You'll be put on a spit, massaged
  with spiced oils by handsome young men, carried around the beach in a Grand
  Procession with music and dancing, then placed over the fire to roast, all
  while you're still alive and all totally without pain or discomfort. You can
  easily last two or three hours. 
�So . . . take a few minutes and decide which option you prefer. Meanwhile,
  let's have Danielle and Alissa do a few turns around the stage for us so the
  good folks out there can have a nice preview of where tonight's meat is coming
  from while it's still sexy, alert and full of life. Go girls!� 
Caitlyn felt caught in some sort of time warp. Trapped in a horrid dream from
  which she could not wake up. She felt the Matron's soft tap on her bare shoulder. 
�So, dear, which one . . .� 
Caitlyn spun on her. �He's here! He's out there!� 
�What?� 
�Kevin! That deceitful slimeball! He's out there in that mob, grinning at
  me! Grinning, for chrissake!� 
�Well, of course he's here, hon. You don't think he'd abandon you at this
  point?� 

�Abandon me! He fucking tricked me into being sentenced to death! I'm up here
  naked and shackled and being told to pick the way I want to be killed, and
  he's out there grinning!� 
�And you want to get back at him?� 
�Damn fucking right I do!� Caitlyn was so furious and so frustrated and so
  frightened she would have thrown up if there'd been anything at all in her
  entire digestive system. 
�Then you have to chose the method of dispatch that shows him you're not going
  to go out with your tail between your legs.� 
�How's my dying up here going to wipe that shiteaten smug grin off his face?
  That's why he tricked me into coming here in the first place. To have me killed!� 
�Exactly. That's why you can't choose to crawl on your belly into the guillotine
  to have your head chopped off, or hang by the neck and slowly strangle to death
  while everyone drinks beer and watches you hop on your toes. You have to choose
  the one way that lets you look him in the eye and grin back because you're
  having a more exciting time than he'll ever have in his whole life.� 
�You want me to tell them how to kill me? I can't! I can't do that! I don't
  want to die at all!� 
�But you are  going to die, love. One way or another, you'll be dead
  in a few more minutes or a few more hours. Do you want to spend your last twenty
  minutes doing a lewd dance for Kevin while you gasp hopelessly for air? Do
  you want your last living memory to be the sight of your headless body lying
  in a guillotine spouting blood from the neck stump?� 
�Noooo!� Caitlyn wailed pitifully. �But to be cooked alive! Jesus Christ!
  That's horrible!� 
�It's painless dear. You won't feel a thing.� 
�How do you  know?� 
�I've talked to lots and lots of girls while they were still alive on the
  spit. They all told me the same thing. It doesn't hurt. In fact, it feels good.
  Their only regret was that it wouldn't go on for days and days.� 
�Really?� 
�Really. Come on. They're running out of patience. I can tell you this: if
  you don't choose the live spitting, they'll give it to Alissa, because she's
  the next most beautiful.� 
�But I can't just . . . tell them to . . .� She choked on a sob.� 
�But you want this to be your  choice, dear, not theirs. Would you
  like me to help you tell them?� 
�Yes,� she said in a small voice, giving in to the inevitable. �I can't tell
  them how to execute me. I just can't.� 
�Then we'll do it together, dear.� The Matron raised her hand for the announcer's
  attention. 

The voice crashed out of the speakers. �Well, it looks like the lovely Caitlyn
  has made up her mind. Which will it be, Caitlyn: the guillotine, slow hanging
  or live spitting? Walk right over to the dispatch machine of your choice.� 
Caitlyn froze, but the Matron took her elbow and guided her over to the live
  spitting display, then spoke for her. �She has decided to be spitted and cooked
  live.� 
�Is that true, Caitlyn?� the amplified voice asked. �Have you chosen live
  spitting for your method of execution?� 
Caitlyn nodded her head miserably. 
An enormous cheer exploded from the crowd. 
�Excellent!� said the voice. �Cooks, begin setting her up immediately.� 
She felt more than saw movement under the stage where she stood naked and
  shivering in the heat. Strangely, now that there was a name to her fate, now
  that her �method of execution� was established, she felt a certain relief.
  The hammering of her heart had not diminished, but suddenly her mind was free
  to begin letting go of life. As she waited for the cooks to arrive (whoever
  they were) to begin setting her up (whatever that meant) she listened and watched
  with a detached curiosity as the announcer turned his attention to the other
  two condemned women. 
�As to our other two comely convicts, Danielle and Alissa, the court has instructed
  that Alissa is to have second choice for the method of dispatch. Alissa, please
  move at once to either the guillotine or the scaffold.� 
The girl looked guiltily at her mother, then shuffled over to the noose. 
�An excellent choice!� said the announcer. With any luck we will get to enjoy
  to sight of your lovely body flailing about in a delightfully obscene dance
  for another twenty minutes or so. That means, of course, that your mother,
  the beautiful Danielle, will be executed by the guillotine. 
A milder, but still enthusiastic cheer went up as mother and daughter were
  led to the devices that would shortly take their lives. No one had yet come
  for Caitlyn, so she stood quietly next to her own death machine (the Matron
  holding her hand for comfort) and watched. 
Alissa was tended to first. One guard held her in place as her Matron dropped
  the noose over her head and snugged it around her neck. A second guard removed
  her leg irons and replaced them with a spreader bar that forced her legs well
  apart and opened up the cleft of her sex for public viewing. They then simply
  backed away as a winch drew the noose upwards, tightening it around the girl's
  pretty neck and lifting her slightly off the stage floor. She could still touch
  it with the toes of one foot or the other by rocking her body to that side
  and pushing down, which provided a second of relief from the grip of the noose,
  but her breathing distress was immediate. She hopped back, pushing off from
  the left, then the right, dragging in small breaths. 

Danielle had been allowed (forced?) to watch the beginning of Alissa's ordeal,
  and it's effect on her was palpable. Her face, until now hardened in resentment,
  crumbled into tears as she watched her daughter begin a struggle for life that
  was already doomed. But after a few moments, she was ordered to kneel down
  before the guillotine frame and bend over, placing her neck in the U-shaped
  slot. Her Matron pulled her hair out of the way and the holding bar was brought
  down over the back of her neck to hold her in place. She was trembling noticeably
  as the safety bolt was withdrawn that kept the heavy blade from accidentally
  sliding down at an inappropriate moment. The Matron took a firm grip of Danielle's
  hair at the scalp and nodded to the guards. The guard placed the trip rope
  in Danielle's handcuffed right hand behind her back. Her Matron spoke up loud
  and clear. �Pull the rope, Danielle!� The condemned woman began to shake but
  did not pull the rope that would drop the blade. �Pull it now or the guard
  will give you a long dose of the cattle prod,� the Matron warned. The woman
  sobbed, drew in a deep breath, held it, and tugged on the rope. The blade slammed
  down and her head swung free, suspended in the Matron's hand. She turned it
  so the dying woman, now only a head, could see the blade pulled quickly back
  up, revealing the gory stump of her neck spurting blood. The crowd emitted
  an appreciative howl. Caitlyn nearly fainted. The Matron turned Danielle's
  head toward the audience for a final look, then after seeing her eyes glaze
  over, dropped the head in a plastic bucket. 
A moment later hard masculine hands grabbed Caitlyn and forced her closer
  to the death machine she had chosen. A gleaming metal shaft about two inches
  thick with a sharp point jutted vertically out of the stage floor, centered
  between two small metal plates angled like the peak of an A-frame roof that
  did not quite come together at the top. To Caitlyn it looked like some kind
  of fiendish saddle, an impression that was confirmed a moment later when the
  guards removed her leg shackles and sat her astride the plates directly above
  the pointed shaft. Her ankles were inserted into a pair of metal cuffs bolted
  to the floor at least three feet apart in a direct line with that same shaft. 
At this point she realized just what the shaft was and where it would be going.
  How was this not going to hurt? Had the Matron gulled her as Kevin had? 
With the turn of a crank the metal �saddle� rose upwards, carrying her with
  it, straightening her legs and stretching them into an inverted V. Another
  guard showed up carrying a long broad bar that looked like a metal 2x6. He
  inserted it into a slot just behind her rump and dropped it down until the
  top as at about the level of her shoulders. While one guard attached two wide
  nylon straps around her hips and just below her breasts and cinched them up
  with slip buckles to pin her tightly against the vertical 2x6, the other attached
  a cross beam to the top of the 2x6. Her handcuffs were removed and her arms
  stretched out along the cross beam and strapped to it at the shoulder, elbow
  and wrist. She was now transformed into a T atop an upside down V and completely
  immobilized, except for her head and fingers. 
Apparently satisfied with their work, the guards stepped back and the Matron
  moved in behind Caitlyn. She began twisting Caitlyn's long hair into a single
  golden braid. Caitlyn, who wouldn't have dared talk to a guard, muttered in
  a low voice, �I'm scared. There's no way that . . . thing . . . isn't going
  to hurt when they run it through me. Can you please ask them to knock me out
  first?� 
�Now don't you fret about that, hon,� the Matron said. �It won't hurt a bit.� 
�But it's so big!� 

�It's designed to numb you on the way through, dear. Just relax. Look at poor
  Alissa over there. I'll bet she's wishing right now she was as beautiful as
  you so she could have chosen first. She'd be over here in your place getting
  prepped for the grandest joy ride of her life, instead of hippity hopping at
  the end of that rope.� 
�Will she actually last twenty minutes like that?� 
�Oh she'd last for hours, dear, but when they're ready for her they'll just
  pull her up a little higher so she can't touch the stage. That's when they
  go into a really wild air dance for about two minutes before they die. Just
  be happy you didn't choose slow hanging. And look what they're doing to Danielle's
  carcass.� 
The mother's body had been pulled out of the guillotine. Her wrists, no longer
  cuffed behind her, were now tied in front with rope. Her leg irons had also
  been removed and her ankles were similarly tied with rope. A six foot pole
  had been inserted between her arms and legs and she was being lifted and carried
  down into the crowd slung from the pole like game carried from the forest. 
�That's not how a lovely child like you should be displayed. Carried through
  a bunch of drunken revelers so they can stick fingers up your hole. And with
  no head. How pretty is that? They won't be sticking no fingers up your pussy,
  hon, because it's gonna be plenty occupied by that spit. What they're gonna
  do is drool watching you turning over that fire.� 
�O God!� Caitlyn squeaked. 
�Now, now, don't get upset. I told you, dear, it ain't gonna hurt. You'll
  hardly feel a thing. Just relax and enjoy it. Show that mean old Kevin you
  got the last laugh.� 
The braiding finished, the Matron reached up for a thin rope dangling from
  a pulley in an overhead beam and tied it into the braid. A gentle pull on the
  rope brought her head up stiffly. Caitlyn was now a straight line from the
  top of her neck to the base of her spine. Only her fingers remained free to
  wiggle. 
Unable to turn her head without pulling painfully on her scalp, Caitlyn stared
  out into the crowd, most of whom were engrossed in watching either her or the
  struggling Alissa whose face was now beet red, her eyes bulging. Caitlyn knew
  she must present quite a spectacle herself and that it would get even more
  so. She spotted Kevin, still grinning up at her. She glared at him, unable
  to pretend she was having a last laugh. How she wished they could magically
  trade places, let him find out what it feels like to be stretched out bare
  naked on a stage in front of a zillion gawkers waiting for you to be skewered
  for dinner! 

A fat man with multiple chins came into view from behind her. She recognized
  him as one of the quartet who had observed her being showered then pawed her
  all over. He was the one who squeezed her arms, thighs, calves, butt, boobs,
  and even pinched the flesh around her belly (even though she was nice and flat,
  for godsake!) like she was a side of beef. Which, as it turns out, she was.
  In his left hand he held a small box, like a TV remote, trailing a cable. He
  crouched down in front of her and with his right hand touched her pussy with
  his thumb. What the hell was he doing? He pressed a button on the TV remote
  and the saddle moved smoothly forward a fraction of an inch. He stood up, gave
  her a friendly smile and pushed another button. A motor hummed to life. Seconds
  later she felt the cold tip of the metal spit touch her outer labia. She stiffened.
  This was it! The man walked off and out of sight. The metal was turning, worming
  its way deeper into her. 
The loudspeakers crackled back to life. �Ladies and gentlemen, the spitting
  of our live roaster has begun. The spit is about an inch into her love canal
  and heading on up. Every few minutes our chief cook will give you a progress
  report by marking off the point in her body the point has reached.� 
It was a queer sensation. The spit was much bigger, harder and colder than
  the warm human flesh that had occupied that space many times before, and instead
  of thrusting in and out it turned lazily. But it wasn't painful. It was even
  oddly pleasurable. Of course, the sharp point had not yet ripped through her
  cervix and womb. As Caitlyn nervously prepared herself for that inevitable
  pain, another strange thing happened. Something liquid splashed against that
  very cervical wall. She was familiar with the exciting sensation of a lover's
  spurting jizm. This was similar yet very different. For one thing it was cold.
  For another, all feeling at that point quickly dissolved, leaving a kind of
  blunt rubbing sensation that was not at all unpleasant. It was as though she
  were being massaged from the inside out. 
The Matron's voice brought her attention back to the world outside. �How you
  holding up, hon? Not so bad, is it?� 
�No. I'm okay. So far. It's like you said: doesn't hurt. So far.� 
�And it won't, dear. My own daughter was done this way and she loved every
  minute of it.� 
�You had a daughter who was eaten?� 
�Honey, I had five daughters and one son. How'd you think I got this heavy?
  Two of my girls signed up as volunteers as soon as they turned fifteen.� 
�Fifteen? I thought sixteen was the minimum age.� 
�It used to be, when I was a girl. Still is for drinking and gambling. But
  they lowered the minimum age for volunteers to fifteen about eight years ago.� 
�But why would your daughters volunteer to be eaten?� 
�Same reason I did. Honey, they'd been coming to these festivals their whole
  lives and saw how exciting it was to be up on this stage and how the crowd
  worships the girls about to be cooked. These bi-weekly festivals are the biggest
  deal on the island and when local girls are added to the menu along with the
  visiting white and Asian girls it's a huge honor. Nothing else a girl can do
  here on Paradise Island comes close. It's also a terrific feeling knowing how
  delicious you'll taste! Girl meat is fabulous. There's nothing like it. Unfortunately
  you won't have a chance to taste it, but take my word for it: girl meat is
  the ambrosia of the gods. Besides, you know how teenage girls are. Looks are
  everything and there's nothing more sexy than a pretty girl on a spit.� 
�So both your daughters went through this?� 

�Well, Raylene did. But Savannah was up against a gorgeous seventeen-year-old
  L.A. starlet and got bumped to second choice, so she chose slow hanging. She
  made the best of it, though. She came at least seven or eight times before
  she died. Also, the Cook oven-roasted her. They got this great see-through
  roasting oven they can set up on the beach right next to the live-roasting
  pit. They can roast a whole girl carcass in it. Savannah looked really sensational
  cooking in that oven.� 
�You don't mind that you lost two daughters? That they were eaten?� 
�Of course not, dear. We all have to go, and that's the best way. If I was
  young and pretty enough to volunteer again, I'd do it in a heartbeat.� 
The fat man was approaching again. 
�Here comes the head cook, hon. He'll show us where the spit is.� 
The cook unrolled a measuring tape and used a chalk marker to draw a horizontal
  line just above Caitlyn's navel. The crowd made appreciative noises. 
�It's that far up?� Caitlyn marveled to the Matron when the cook had left.
  I felt something kind of tickling in there, but there's no pain at all. Will
  it stay like that?� 
�Yes, sweetheart. It's just like I told you. Painless. So enjoy it. Now when
  it gets up to your throat it will be hard to breathe for a little while, but
  don't panic. We'll fix it and you'll be just fine. Shush now. I'm going to
  step away for a little while so the crowd can enjoy watching you. You're such
  a lovely visual treat!� 
Caitlyn's nervous system seemed to have zeroed in on the point of the shaft
  and the surface of her clit. The lump-like, tickling sensation working its
  way up the center of her body was as vaguely pleasurable as it was odd; but
  the thick, slightly ribbed and very hard cold metal of the deadly shaft relentlessly
  turning and rubbing against her sexual apparatus was becoming a great deal
  more than merely pleasurable. Whatever miraculous chemical concoction the spit
  was excreting that was mercifully numbing its invasion route through her body
  had blessedly spared everything south of her cervix. While the highly evolved
  part of her cerebrum demanded that she not allow any part of this appalling
  process to give her pleasure, her primal animal brain stem paid heed only to
  the sexual currents radiating from her vaginal walls, labia and clit. Much
  to her intellectual annoyance her body was increasingly in the grip of responses
  that were wildly unseemly in her present circumstances, her nerve centers on
  the brink of a full fledged, high voltage orgasm! All it took was a glance
  over at the frantically hopping Alissa with her starkly revealed cunt, and
  another down at the body of Danielle slung from its pole being circulated through
  an openly horny, hands-on crowd, and her sensual command center went on overload! 
At the same moment she felt a hand on her shoulder. Hoping it was the Matron
  she pleaded, �Help me! O God! I'm going to come!� 
�Of course you are, dear,� the Matron said in her calm, comforting tone. �I
  told you, didn't I? And this is only the beginning.� 
�But I can't do it . . . here in front of . . . all these people!� She was
  taking in heavy ragged breaths, trying to stave of the inevitable. 
�Of course you can, dear. All our girls do. That's what everyone is waiting
  for. You'd better do it now, though, because you'll have to be still when the
  spit gets up between your lungs.� 

�No! I can't! . . . It's too . . . They'll all see . . . Ahhhhh!� Her body
  squirmed on the saddle like an eel stretched between two hooks as she let out
  a long, distinctly unseemly cry of ecstacy. The crowd cheered and applauded. 
When the sizzle subsided, she opened her eyes in time to see the fat Cook
  make a chalk mark on her belly half way between her navel and the undershelf
  of her breasts. Another man stood next to him. It was the greying older man
  with the gold-rimmed glasses from the shower room observers. He was now surveying
  her carefully from several angles. He gripped her narrow waist with both hands
  and pressed his thumbs into her abdomen, apparently feeling for the shaft.
  Then he stepped back and said in a mellifluous voice, �It's going very well,
  pretty lady. Exactly on target. Now don't you have any more orgasms like that
  until it's out your mouth. Little ones are okay, but not big ones. You don't
  want it to tear your heart or rupture your lungs.� With that, both men wandered
  out of her line of vision. 
The Matron was back at her side, being careful not to obstruct the view of
  her audience. 
�I can't believe I did that,� Caitlyn told her. �That was even more humiliating
  than being stripped naked and raped by a spit in front of a beach full of men
  and women.� 
�But it felt good, didn't it?� 
�Lord yes! God help me.� 
�And you're wanting more, I'll bet.� 
�It's building up again right now!� 
�Well, you do what the doctor said, dear. Come a little at a time. Don't hold
  it back. Once the spit is past your heart and your lungs and is sticking out
  your mouth, then you can let those little rushes grow into great big volcanic
  orgasms and it won't matter. But you don't want to die before the real fun
  begins. I promise you, dear, before this is over you'll understand why all
  the island girls would rather ride that spit than any man ever born.� 
It occurred to Caitlyn that once the spit did fill her mouth she would probably
  not be able to talk any more. She would no longer have the Matron's comforting
  voice to help her through her ordeal. Desperate to keep her talking, Caitlyn
  said, �What I don't understand is how you keep from depleting the island of
  girls if you keep eating them. I would think the boys would object.� 
The Matron broke into a high-pitched cheerful laugh. �Oh the boys love to
  eat pretty girls. We only use five or six volunteers a year because there's
  a plentiful supply of pretty white girls who like to come here to gamble, especially
  when it's all free. Besides, for some reason there are many more girl babies
  born on Paradise Island than boy babies. Believe me, the waiting list is always
  a long one. Most girls become too old or get pregnant before they're selected.� 
�How old is too old?� 
�Seventeen.� 
�So I guess I'm kind of old to be cooked.� 
�Not at all, dear. You'll be very tender and tasty. And you'll look wonderful.
  White girls' skin turns a sexy shade of bronze when it's fully roasted.� 

�I'm scared.� 
�About what, dear.� 
�The fire. I'll be alive when they put me over the fire!� 
�And it won't hurt a bit. Look out at the crowd, dear. So those babies sucking
  at their mother's tits, and the little toddlers and young girls? Do you think
  their mommies and daddies would let them come and watch this if you was being
  tortured? Every female out there, young and old, is envying you right now.� 
�Even though I'm staked out here naked with my boobs and cunt exposed and
  everything?� 
�Hon, didn't you notice that half the shoreline of this island is nude beaches?
  For us locals, tits and pussy ain't nothing to hide. They're natural. At home
  me and my daughters are nude half the time. And a lot of the tourists don't
  mind stripping off those silly bikini bits when they see it's officially approved
  and no big deal.� 
A flurry of activity on the stage to her left drew Caitlyn's attention. Alissa
  had been raised several inches higher and was no longer able to touch the stage
  with the toes of either foot. She was thrusting her legs at the floor in a
  chaotic and desperate attempt to relieve the deadly clutch of the noose. The
  spreader bar holding her ankles apart turned her hopeless efforts into an exceedingly
  obscene dance. At the same time Caitlyn could see a rivulet of liquid running
  from her pink cunt down both inner thighs. The girl, in the midst of her final
  death dance, was coming like crazy! After a few minutes, her body froze, twitched
  in a final few spasms, and became still. Her eyes and mouth were wide open,
  her tongue protruding, drool dripping from the corners of her lips. Much to
  her shame, the sight pushed Caitlyn over the edge once more and she shuddered
  in a rapid fire series of small orgasms as the crowd applauded Alissa's final
  performance. 
Then she began to suffer her own distress. The tip of the spit, as gentle
  as a bubble, had touched the part of her throat that enabled her to swallow.
  It was also beginning to cut off her breath. Her body bucked in protest, a
  more restricted version of Alissa's last throes, and her mouth was open to
  scream for help, but her voice no longer functioned. In a total panic, she
  felt her head snapped backward by the hair so she was staring straight up.
  Pleading silently for a gasp of air, she felt the metal shaft push quickly
  into her mouth, slide over her tongue and ram past her teeth. She saw the bloody
  tip emerge from her mouth and at the same moment felt a life-saving rush of
  air blast into her desperate lungs. The relief was so tremendous it took several
  seconds for it to sink in that she was now fully spitted. She didn't know how
  she was still able to breathe with this huge shaft filling up her throat and
  mouth, but it was irrelevant. Her body was beyond salvage now. She was just
  a skewered morsel of girl meat ready for the fire. 
Chapter 5: En Brochette 
There's nothing like a metal pole running through your body from cunt to mouth
  to put things in perspective. With her fate sealed, physically and irrevocably,
  her inhibitions and fear of death melted away. She didn't care any more that
  she was naked on a public stage. She didn't care any more that her audience
  was planning to eat her. She was still a little worried that the Matron had
  sugar-coated what it would be like to be cooked alive over a fire, but she
  was way past any ability to mitigate the situation so she decided not to think
  about it. Whatever they were going to do to her, they would do. 
The spit was turning faster, now, moving through her body faster. She watched
  the bloody ridges on it's surface going past her nose, an inch away from her
  eyes. It was about all she could see, now. She closed her eyes and concentrated
  on the feelings at the other end of her body. Intense, electric feelings! The
  speeded up shaft was doing egregiously delicious things to her super-sensitized
  G-spots! A new seismic wave was building rapidly! She focused on it. Helped
  it grow. Urged it on! Why not? She remembered reading somewhere that the last
  resort of the defeated is to surrender and make the best deal you can. 
The irony of the word did not escape her. She'd been a party girl, addicted
  to the twin lures of full-throttle sex with unabashedly macho men and blackjack
  tables in noisy gambling resorts. Kevin � strong, commanding, handsome � had
  baited the hook and she had snapped it up like a hungry trout. Now she was
  a trophy on a stick. He had lured her to her last resort. She had gambled and
  lost. 
Time to make the best of it! She let it come! The wave swept up through her!
  Took her breath away! Stiffened her body with electric fire! She trembled and
  vibrated on her spit, rolling her hips, fucking the shaft, feeling its new
  slipperyness in her cunt as her girl juices poured out. No sound issued from
  her demolished vocal cords, but her lips made indecent sucking movements on
  the hard steel. 
As she drifted down from the peak of her orgasm, she felt hands removing the
  cuffs and straps that had been holding her rigidly in place. She felt the metal
  board behind her lifted out and removed. Her arms were pulled severely behind
  her, hands on the opposite elbow and wired together, forearm to forearm. It
  pulled her shoulders back and forced her breasts out. She remembered how reluctant
  she'd been just a day earlier to bare her nipples and pussy at the nude beach.
  How ridiculous such modesty seemed now! The wires bit into her arms and really
  began to hurt. She whimpered a little. But someone painted the afflicted area
  with a cold substance and in a moment the pain was gone. Apparently the Matron
  was being honest with her. This was really going to be painless. 

A fist worked its way under her bottom and took a grip on the spit. Someone
  said, �Okay boys, up she goes,� and she felt herself move. They were lifting
  her out of the machine that had impaled her, the fist in her crotch keeping
  her from sliding down the spit while it was still vertical. She couldn't see
  much since she was unable to move her head at all and the spit obscured most
  of her vision, but as the spit was lowered to horizontal she caught sight of
  a trestle, like a small saw-horse. She saw the end of the spit beyond her mouth
  dropped into a notch in the trestle and all movement came to a stop. She guessed
  there was an identical trestle at the other end. 
Her body was impaled on the spit, but her legs hung down, her toes touching
  the stage floor. She found she could lift them a little, but it caused burning
  pain elsewhere in her body so she quickly desisted. There was a clanking of
  metal and vibrations in the spit. They were doing something to it but she couldn't
  tell what. She felt a familiar hand caressing her shoulder 
�Now you just relax, dear,� the Matron said. �All they're doing now is attaching
  a little crossbar to the spit so they can wire your legs to it. That will hold
  you in place so you'll turn with the spit and roast nice and even.� 
Even as she said it, hands lifted her legs and stretched them out along the
  spit. She felt the �little bar� against the back of her knees and the wire
  being wrapped around them, snugging them tightly and painfully to the spit
  and bar. More wire cinched her ankles to the spit. A moment later the unseen
  brush painted numbness into her knees and ankles. Once again she was pain free. 
She felt the Matron doing something with her hair. Wrapping it into a bun
  and pinning it in place. 
�Honey, they're gonna carry you down into the crowd, now, so everyone can
  get a good look at how beautiful you are and maybe run their hands over that
  silky young skin of yours before we baste it. So you just relax and enjoy yourself.
  If you feel yourself coming, you just go ahead and come! You've earned it.
  And don't you feel embarrassed about it, either. These are good folks and they
  like to see you having a good time. I'll bet my daughter had at least twenty
  orgasms while they were parading her around. I could see her humping that pole
  and dripping pussy juice the whole time. So you just go right to it, dear.� 
Caitlyn felt the spit move and rolled her eyes up to see the meaty hand of
  a guard picking up the front end of the spit. The shaft had been cleaned of
  her blood and gleamed in the sun. She felt the Matron's hand give her bottom
  a friendly slap as the floor began moving beneath the spit. The motion of the
  spit immediately triggered shivery blasts of pleasure from her clit and vagina
  as the shaft teased the sensitive flesh. Yesterday's Caitlyn would have been
  horrified at the idea of having orgasms and dripping pussy juice in the midst
  of a crowd, but then yesterday's Caitlyn wore tiny strips of cloth to hide
  her now very public nipples and vulva. Yesterday' Caitlyn confined all her
  sexual activity to private rooms, but today she was meat on a skewer and had
  already delivered a spectacular public orgasm or two. So what did she care?
  What dignity was there left to preserve? She gave in to her body's demand and
  began a soft undulation on the spit that caused an instant explosion of pleasure!
  Then another. And another. The combined movement of the spit as the men carried
  it along and her own bodily squirming brought on a cascade of orgasms that
  blotted out all the embarrassment of yesterday's Caitlyn. 

She thought about the porn movies her various boy friends had shown her to
  heat her up for their own ambitions. How could those actresses strip naked
  and fuck in front of a camera crew in a film that thousands would see, she
  had wondered? Now look at her. She heard a group of musicians playing guitars
  and rhythm instruments and singing. She heard laughter and loud chattering
  voices. The sounds made her come! She felt a sea of hands sliding over her
  body, competing for possession of her tits, fingering her labia, stroking her
  arms and legs, grasping her feet. She caught sight of little girls, their small
  hands patting her face and hair, brushing the tips of her nipples, looking
  adoringly into her eyes, dreaming of being in her place one day. Every touch
  made her body come harder, longer, sizzling her to the soul, flinging her into
  far galaxies of ecstacy. She wanted it to go on and on and on forever. 
But it didn't. 
It got better. 
They had placed her spit on trestles again, but not up on stage. She was near
  the roasting pits. She could smell the aroma of roasting meat. A heavenly fragrance
  like grilled ribs. Slightly sweet. One or both of the other girls, no doubt,
  roasting whole in a timed sequence a little ahead of Caitlyn to spread out
  the availability of freshly cooked meat. 
Multiple hands began massaging an oily substance into her skin. All of her,
  from her face to the soles of her feet and toes. Again waves of ecstatic pleasure
  swept through her, leaping to screaming peaks whenever a finger flicked across
  the tip of a nipple or touched the hair-trigger lips around her clit, or especially
  the clit itself. They turned her slowly as they worked in the buttery oil,
  making good natured remarks about the tremors racking her body and the delicate
  flavor of the juices she produced with each successive orgasm and which they
  collected in a drip pan and sipped. The fat head cook, whose hands were not
  covered with basting oil, periodically ran a middle finger between her vaginal
  wall and the spit to scoop out a taste for himself. When they had finished
  basting her, they wrapped the golden bun of her hair in aluminum foil and pinned
  it in place. 
The Matron's face appeared next to hers. �It's time now for you to be cooked,
  dear. Now don't you be scared. That oil they rubbed into you will take care
  of the pain. I've been watching you and you've had some real good honkin' orgasms.
  The boys have been drinking up your juices while they've been feeling you all
  over and every one of them's in love with you. They gave me a taste, too. You
  can tell what a girl's gonna taste like by the quality of her pussy juice,
  and honey, you are A number one first class meat! These folks are in for a
  real treat tonight! That young girl Alissa who's already cooking, she's gonna
  be some tasty, too. But you're the best. And you're the feature attraction!
  So have fun and give �em a good show, dear. I gotta go now, so they can put
  you over the fire. They're on a strict schedule. Just relax, and let those
  big O's roll. Buh bye, sweetheart.� 
She was gone. 

Caitlyn saw that her spit was being lifted again. She was face down but could
  see not much more than the ground directly below her on either side of the
  thick shaft. Her body seemed curiously detached. Then she realized it was because
  she could barely feel the movement of the spit. Now she could see the roasting
  pit, a bracket on both ends to hold the spit. Now she was hovering over it,
  low flames licking the surface of red hot coals. The heat forced her to close
  her eyes. She felt something change and squinted to see what it was. She was
  rotating. Except for her eyes the fire didn't hurt at all, and if she closed
  her eyes while face down that wasn't too bad either. She felt terribly warm,
  hotter than she'd ever been in her life, but her skin was not searing as is
  should have been. Or at least she couldn't feel it, if it was. 
The extreme heat did have an unexpected effect. It set off a tremendous sexual
  charge from her clit that brought on a monumental orgasm. The sensation drove
  every other thought out of her mind. She was only aware of the battering waves
  of ecstacy that electrified her from the roots of her hair to her toenails.
  Nothing else mattered! Nothing else came close to mattering. Nothing else even
  existed! Nothing!! Nothing!!! 
Epilogue: Next! 
He watched the cute Asian girl steadily, not caring if she noticed or not.
  He kept his boyish grin in place, however, because women always knew when a
  man was staring at them. There was a fine line between threatening behavior
  and romantic interest and he knew exactly where it was. He had no intention
  of frightening this quarry away. 
Normally he would look for blondes. His clients paid much better for blondes,
  and for good reason. Blondes didn't taste any better, of course, but the contrast
  between the fair golden glow of a blonde and his clients' dark hair and complexion
  was extremely sexy. 
His last procurement was a good example. They offered top dollar for her.
  Caitlyn was certainly tasty; he enjoyed the slice of breast and the crunchy
  nipple he was presented as part of his payment. But she was no more delicious
  than a hundred other girls whose tits he had enjoyed over the years. If she
  stood out in his mind at all, it was for the months of intimacy leading up
  to her sale. She was an astonishing fucking machine! For one of the rare times
  in his career as Provider for the Paradise Island festivals he regretted having
  to turn over his catch. Fucking her was the one perk that really meant anything
  to him. No woman had come as close to capturing his heart and his prick as
  that astonishing woman! But he had no choice, of course. Having brought a gambling
  addict to a Paradise Island Casino, he had sealed her fate. 
Oh well. He focused his attention on his latest target. She had just won a
  few hundred dollars and was jumping up and down and hugging her girl friend
  and roommate. They were nineteen year old college sophomores and she had the
  kind of fire in her belly for gambling that spelled big bucks for Kevin. She
  peeked over at him as though she had never noticed him before. An innocent,
  ripe plum. He grinned back boyishly. 
She was his for the picking.
