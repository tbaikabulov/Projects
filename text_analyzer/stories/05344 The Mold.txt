The Mold

By Darqside

&nbsp;

Sara awoke out of her stupor with a jolt.� A strange sensation of pressure on her body,
it was the first time she�d realized something had happened to her.

&nbsp;

The first thing she noticed was that the room she was in was
pitch black all around save for a series of strange sets of rib-like bars that
circled around her at varying levels above and below her line of sight.� She wasn�t quite sure what these were for,
but the design was all-encasing.� Any
source of light that could be seen could only be reflected on the silvery metal
of the bars, making everything obscure to her sense of sight.

&nbsp;

The bars themselves circled around her and domed above her
head like some kind of strange metallic body shaped igloo or non-piercing
iron-maiden.� The mesh of metal
surrounded her and seemed to be attached somehow to whatever the apparatus was
that she was wearing.

&nbsp;

It was then she noticed her body was encased in what
appeared to be thick black rubber, and not just any rubber�particularly this
stuff prevented movement of any kind, keeping all joints stiff and outward.

&nbsp;

She tried to relax her body against the restraining
material, simply by relaxing her legs, she felt like leaning up against a
wall.� The joints in the suit she was
wearing were so solid she might as well be sleeping
while standing up, as no amount of tottering would cause her to lose her
balance.

&nbsp;

Additionally she seemed to be balanced neatly on her toes in
encased pirouette.� Her feet were
pointed, yet the very bottoms (which of course she could only just barely see
with her unmoving neck) were apparently fused to the floor.� Meaning she couldn�t so much as pick up her
feet or adjust their position even if she wanted to.� Her arms were fixed outward like branches of
a tree, strange couplings appeared to be fused to her
wrists as part of the suit which in turn were fused with the strange hive-shaped
rib cage that surrounded her.� The rubber
in her fingers was thick enough to prevent even her idle hands from doing much
except pointing outwards. �The only
aspect of her that could move apparently was her mouth and eyes, the rest felt
like molded cement or bronze, but with rubber as the material.

&nbsp;

She looked at the suit as much as she could manage from her
limited unmoving perspective, lots of tubes, clamps, seemingly metallic devices
that behaved like a skeletal structure around the rubber that encased her.� There was no sign of entry for the suit, or
exit for that matter.

&nbsp;

Her mind started to panic and she began to pant heavily
inside the claustrophobia-inducing material.�
The sound of her breath pumping itself through a strange rubber tube
affixed to her face.� As she continued to
take in gasps of panicked air, she began to smell a faint odor in the
controlled environment she was in.

&nbsp;

It smelled pungent and almost sweet, like a piece of fruit
but mixed with rubber, but something in her gut instinct told her that she
shouldn�t let her body inhale it�to take it in.�
It was strange, but the very idea of breathing this stuff felt like it
was breaking down her defenses, leaving her weak.

&nbsp;

But seeing as there was no means of breathing otherwise, and
her panic caused her to breathe it in anyway�.there was no means of doing
otherwise, short of trying to asphyxiate herself.

&nbsp;

The best means of describing the situation was that she was
trapped in a prison within a prison.�
With consideration to how she got into that predicament, well, she
couldn�t even remember.

&nbsp;

In fact, there was very little she could do in that blank
place, even her under-stimulated mind felt restricted somehow.� It felt exhausting for her brain to process
anything in the state she was in.� Every
time she tried to recall back to a time when she wasn�t in this situation, her
mind would get bombarded with random flashes of strange images.� She was beginning to wonder why it was she
thought her name was Sara in the first place.�
Every time she closed her eyes she was bombarded with images�these
images did not make sense to her in the slightest, nor did they hint at the
reason behind her predicament.

&nbsp;

Seeing as she was so idle in mind and body, taking her focus
off these things was difficult.� Her mind
couldn�t seem to focus even on a daydream or her own personal thoughts.� Observation and viewing of her current self
within the suit, along with determining any sort of physical sensations, seemed
to be the only things she was cognitive and capable of doing without much
mental strain.

&nbsp;

Her suit had several tubes on it, some of which delved deep
into the recesses of the suit itself, others appeared to merely circulate
around it like black snakes.

&nbsp;

Her eyes drifted downward almost reflexively towards her
breasts for some undetermined amount of time, her mind seemed compelled to do
this.� A pair of long black tubes that
snaked out of the metal mesh appeared to be attached to each breast.� Ever so slightly she tried to shift her chest
weight within the tight confines of the bizarre suit she was in.

&nbsp;

Just as she had thought�the tubes were attached directly to
her nipples and areolas.� The sensation
felt somewhat penetrative, as though the tubes themselves were driven deep
inside her chest.� There was no
pain�simple the sensation of being �attached� to something else.� Seeing as she wasn�t able to move in the
first place, all she could manage to do was acknowledge the strange tubes�
presence inside of her.

&nbsp;

After a time she felt compelled to look further down past
her breasts towards the rest of her body, this being a hard feat, she closed
her eyes and began to sense things about her body via her sense of touch.� It was strange, but due to the sensory
deprivation she now appeared to be able to acknowledge her sense of touch in
more detail, somewhat like how blind people are able to get their bearings
through sound and touch.

&nbsp;

She could sense that a strange long set of tubes were
apparently plunging deep into the recesses of her uterus and anus.� This generated no pain or pleasure on her
part, almost like a catheter or some kind of surgical device. The tubes felt
warm yet rigid like the rubber the rest of her body was encased in.� On instinct she made her vagina and anus
clinch around the two intruding tubes, in an attempted to expel them or at
least jar them.� The clamping reflex of
her muscles made a slight tug on the tubes, which she discovered to be attached
even further in her body than she was capable of sensing�as she felt slight
tugging in her solar plexus from doing so.�
The tubes were so far inside of her they might as well have ruptured her
insides, yet she felt no pain.� The idea
boggled her already limited mind.� Still
trying to resist she tried jerking her buttocks backwards only to ultimately
hit the wall that was the suit that kept her stiff and erect.

&nbsp;

Sara (was that really her name?) was starting to have
thoughts that this suit might be designed to simply keep her in stasis than for
other purposes.� She noted the total lack
of stimulation on her body, just the feeling of being �stuck� to things or
�hooked up�.� The smell of the strange
gas came to her nostrils again, but the smell itself was unrelenting.� It was then she discovered the reason for
this was because a pair of tubes were invading the
recesses of her nostrils up through her nasal cavity, she had no idea how far
they went.

&nbsp;

A pair of tubes also appeared to have invaded her ears, yet
there was no sensation of them piercing her ear drum�

&nbsp;

Considering the only orifice left to her was her mouth, she
tried to open it.

&nbsp;

No sound?� Of course
she was aware of the fact her ears were blocked by the tubes, but she couldn�t
even feel the usual tremor of her voice, nothing but silence.

&nbsp;

That�s when she discovered a strange cylindrical device
appeared to be lodged in the back of her throat, a long tab of it extending
upwards over the top and around her tongue.�
It felt as though a single tiny hand had a tight grip on her tongue and
the inside of her throat.� She could move
her tongue without effort, and the very tip of her tongue was most definitely
free, but her throat seemed to be under an immense amount of pressure.� Why she hadn�t noticed before, she was unable
to tell but, the feeling was as though the cylinder was gradually stretching
the width of her throat.� It didn�t feel
painful per se, but the sensation of her throat widening, not to mention a
total lack of gag reflex, was there.� She
tried swallowing, only to find small strange metal prongs attached to the
cylinder in her throat responded to the reflex and were forcing the muscles to
be misdirected from the downward motion.

&nbsp;

She swallowed again, testing the device, again her throat
muscles were being forced to close around cylinder and not in a downward motion
to expel it.� Furthermore, as she opened
her mouth, she found her tongue to forcibly be ejected from her mouth by the
strange hand attached to it.� Every time
she opened up her mouth, her tongue was sticking outwards, being
stretched.� Testing her limits, she
opened her mouth as wide as she could, after a space of about an inch, her jaw
line touched the rubber encasement molded to her jaw.� Her tongue was stretched to an almost painful
limit, yet there seemed to be no pain in doing this.� She discovered something while stretching her
tongue out.

&nbsp;

In the very front of the mask she felt a strange
structure.� It was rubbery in texture,
yet very conical in shape.� Just touching
it with her tongue felt strange and familiar for some reason�almost
inviting.� It was then she discovered her
head could lean forward ever so slightly to accommodate the reach made towards
this strange object.

&nbsp;

Her tongue was able to not only touch this thing, but she
could seize it in her teeth, wrap her tongue around it, or pull her lips onto
it tightly.� It felt like she was eating
a large cucumber or pickle, but the sensation was that of the rubber, and the
more she tasted of it, the more engaged she became.

&nbsp;

It wasn�t so much that it stimulated her, but that it gave
her something to do�it felt like a large pacifier, only more cylindrical in
shape.� She discovered that she could
draw this strange object into her mouth for long periods of time, deep in the
recesses of her throat.� The object
appeared to be not only attached to the front of the mast, but also had some
kind of clicking mechanism behind it.� 

&nbsp;

The mechanism worked like this, she could bend her head
forward, clamp down on the object and draw it towards her face, and the object
would stay deep inside her mouth for long periods of time, only after a
time-release click would it retreat back to the front of the mask.� It wasn�t so much that she could forcibly
expel it with her mouth once it was lodged there, as all she could do was wait
with it in her mouth until the release broke away, but the simple act of
drawing it towards her engaged her faculties.

&nbsp;

Each time she drew the object into her mouth, the strange
object would remain there for longer and longer periods of time, continuing to
make her senses curious about its nature.�
The release time was nearly impossible to predict, but she always felt
eager to draw the object in again.� At
least it was something to do in this black hell.

&nbsp;

Time passed, although by how much she was uncertain.� The images that flashed whenever she closed
her eyes were more random and intense than ever.� It didn�t even feel like watching TV.� Nothing in the images that randomly appeared
for lightning quick intervals in her mind seemed to grab her attention, let
alone her memory, they simply felt like an annoying
distraction�that is, until she realized the images were associated with the
suit.

&nbsp;

The images began to make sense to her, if only in
snatches:� large crowds of people holding
cocktail glasses, women in bunny suits, young men half-naked kneeling facing
her line of vision, a whip, rope, a naked man on top of her�.a large penis
penetrating her mouth.� All of these
images appeared to show up in patterns among other images, simply things she recognized,
or acknowledged to be there.

&nbsp;

In an act of defiance she tried to keep her eyes open for
long intervals, to keep the images away, but the more she did this the more
tired her eyes became.� At once point she
felt so exhausted by her ordeal she fell asleep, only to wake up with memories
and a dream-like sexual fetish experience.

&nbsp;

Fear crept once again in her mind�.things inside her head
were telling her �this is right� or �this is good for you� and �you�re better
off this way�.� Trying
to convince her that they were an extension of her psyche.� By resisting she began to expend her energy
which in turn caused her eyes to close in rest, only to wake up with more
unwanted dreams.

&nbsp;

Her arms and legs unmoving during this ordeal, felt the
strain and stress she wanted to exhibit, but they could not move in the
slightest, forced in a strange fetish crucifix, sans nails and cross.

&nbsp;

The images, the tubes, the encased rubber, the cage around
her, the fact she was standing up on tip-toe, the rubbery fruit gas, all these
things culminated and began to wear down her mind.� She couldn�t think, she couldn�t process
anything in any organized fashion�all she could do was react to any and all
stimulus imposed upon her.

&nbsp;

More time passed, and during this time she discovered the
strange phallic object was indeed a penis, or rather a simulated one�and she
was learning the physical motions of taking it into herself.� Even if her mind resisted, it was too
exhausted to control anything and so she gave into the physical reflex of
taking it into her mouth for longer and longer intervals�until in one final
moment a loud click sounded.

&nbsp;

It took a few seconds for her to realize what had
happened.� The front of the mask overall
appeared to be tighter, and the strange phallic rubber object had driven itself
even deeper than usual into the recesses of her throat.� She waited�the time seemed to drag on forever
but�she�d learned to predict when the object would retreat but�

&nbsp;

�This time, the object didn�t return to its original
state.� It was now locked to the hilt of
her face.� Additionally, it appeared to
be much wider in volume than before, causing her to press her tongue upon the
bottom of her mouth, and her lips appeared to be on the verge of closing around
the object to the point of swallowing it entirely, the cylinder in the back of
her throat locking onto it.� Yet it
remained, not only as a gag in her mouth, but also she noted the tightness
around her chin that had been created, forcing her mouth to be permanently shut
and locked in place.

&nbsp;

If her mind was stable, it would�ve laughed at her
foolishness, teased her for doing such a stupid thing, now restricted in the
only freedom she had originally been given, she was now more a statue than
ever.� Her jaw, tongue, even throat,
could not move at all.� Her neck, which
had been accommodated for drawing the object into her mouth, now drew back and
locked into stiff position for the last time.�
Her last remaining freedom being her own panicked eyes
that observed the motionless black spectacle before her.

&nbsp;

Because of her motionless state, it felt as though time
stood still�no change could be registered, and certainly no sense of time could
be made.� Closing her eyes and waiting
seemed like the only thing left to her, but she knew what would happen should
she close them.

&nbsp;

She was beginning to lose her sanity, or perhaps it was
merely her sense of self�no longer did she feel like a person, but merely a set
of eyes attached to a motionless statue.�
She could smell things, but her body did not react to them, and things
continued to be this way for an eternity.

&nbsp;

Motionless, still, and ever-quiet, her body continued to
remain.� Her mind taxing itself heavily
to renounce the images bearing down on the inside of her closed eyes every time
she would blink.� It would�ve felt like
pain in her joints for being stiff for so long, but instead she felt
nothing.� Everything felt dull and numb.

&nbsp;

After a time, the silence was broken by a loud swishing
noise that frightened and shocked her senses.�
The swishing was coming from the tubes, not just one or two, but all of
them.�� The tubes trembled and shook like
an earthquake as liquid material rushed into them.

&nbsp;

It came as a jolt to her senses when she realized the first
tubes to experience the fluid were her in her nose.� Considering that she had been breathing in
the gas-like material from this tube, it was mortifying to think of the
possibility of drowning in the fluid that rushed up her nose and back through
her nasal cavity, yet that didn�t seem to be the case.

&nbsp;

The fluid seemed to take in oxygen along with it, making the
material breathable, yet very sticky in essence.� It began to coat its way down the length of
her throat and for a time, flooded her mouth completely.

&nbsp;

It had no taste to speak of, but the sensation was that of
liquid rubber.� This material coated her
teeth, every aspect of her gums, and even her pressured tongue.� Much to her surprise however, the fluid
didn�t spill out of her mouth as the strange gag held the fluid in place.

&nbsp;

She was then forced to swallow what felt like gallons of the
stuff, taking it down her throat as fast as the cylinder would let it.� It seemed to double as a filter, bisecting
her esophagus and lungs, keeping the fluid out of vital areas.

&nbsp;

As the fluid tortured her mouth and nasal passage, it began
to invade other areas as well�the tubes began to flood, or rather�inflate her
breasts�she could feel the weight as the material injected itself deep into
them.

&nbsp;

There was no pain to speak of, but the fluid was definitely
going directly into her.� She could feel
her breasts stretch to accommodate the volume of the fluid.� It was amazing but, her breasts appeared to
be more supple than she�d last thought, more flexible
than she imagined.� It was then she
realized the rubber fluid smelled the same as the gas she�d originally inhaled,
which would explain her sudden internal flexibility.

&nbsp;

Her breasts went from, according to her knowledge, a size C
cup, to on the verge of becoming E Cup.

&nbsp;

The fluid continued to flood her body, even up through her
anus and vagina, which felt in essence like becoming pregnant, she could feel
the pressure on her abdomen, but this soon subsided as the sensation left from
that point and began filling into the sides of her hips and butt for some
reason.

&nbsp;

She began to feel tighter in the suit than ever before, as
the material was now more restrictive on her body due to the changes in size,
yet somehow the suit managed to keep the tightness from being unbearable,
despite the fact she was unmovable.

&nbsp;

After a time the fluid rushed to the top of her head, and
she felt slightly dizzy from the ordeal.�
Pressure began to build in her eyes to the point of migraine, until the
sensation that tears were flowing out her eyes relieved that pressure.� But she could tell immediately that these
were no normal tears, the tears came in large waves, sticking to the sides of
her face and flooding the mask.�
Eventually, through slow process, the mask had been filled with the
fluid via her eyes, not to mention that the rest of the suit had been flooded
as far down as her feet or more with the stuff.

&nbsp;

It was a strange sensation, breathing in fluids and feeling
the sloshing taking place inside and outside her body.� The fluid had stopped flowing from the tubes
for a good while by then, basically forcing her to baste in the liquid.

&nbsp;

After a time something clicked at the bottom of her heels
and the remaining fluid began to drain away, leaving a strange dark coating on
every surface of her body, both inside and out.�
One by one, the tubes began to detach themselves from the epidermis of
the solid suit, the holes remaining closing automatically, this including the
tubes that had plunged deep inside her nostrils and vagina, not to mention
every other orifice.

&nbsp;

Once everything fell away, she realized she was now
breathing normally again, yet the suit continued to be statuesque.� The tubes that had run into her nostrils had
all but left, yet somehow she was able to breathe in the encased rubber with
little difficulty.

&nbsp;

The only thing that hadn�t left her was the strange dildo
that had locked itself onto her face and apparently, due to the coating of the
fluid, was now more a part of her face than ever, both inside and out.

&nbsp;

The sensation of being �coated� with rubbery material was
strange enough, but when she realized she�d been flooded with the stuff, her
breasts and ass full and sloshing, she began to realize the nature of her
predicament, that of becoming a fetish doll of some sort.

&nbsp;

Things continued to be motionless, save for the gentle
swaying of the now fallen away tubes, which at least gave her something to look
at.� But she was still inside the suit,
which in turn was inside the conical bars, which in turn was solid black
everywhere she looked.� The coating began
to harden itself on her skin, not so much a painful process, but a rather
stiffening one.� Parts of her face and
body began to stretch and tighten as the material dried, even wrinkles on her
fingers felt like they were disappearing.�
Her eyes now had a strange black gloss to them that she�d never noticed
up until now.� It felt as though she were wearing tinted contact lenses, but the sensation was
all the way around her eyes.

&nbsp;

She wasn�t sure how, but the rubber was allowing oxygen to
enter in her lungs, despite her closed mouth and encased face.� As the rubber continued to harden, she noted
that her breasts and hips no longer had a fluid sensation in them, but that
some kind of mold had been placed in them, forcing them into a peculiar shape.

&nbsp;

That�s when she realized that the suit wasn�t simply there
for keeping her imprisoned, but also served as a mold for the fluid
itself�keeping her arms and legs stretched out was used as a means of coating
every inch of her body easily�but that was only the beginning of the process.

&nbsp;

The rubber coating and the hard encasing rubber that she�d
been locked in seemed to be made of the same if not similar material, making it
reasonable to assume she could still breathe even though the outfit had no
openings to speak of.

&nbsp;

She began to hear a faint hissing noise in her ears now, the
sound of pressure escaping.� In a single
instant, the gas mask with lenses that had been her only window into this dark
place popped off her face, exposing her eyes and rubber-enclosed lips to the
sterile prison.� She was uncertain the
reason behind this, but the mask fell to the floor with a rubbery clatter.

&nbsp;

Despite the fact that her eyes now felt more
free than before, she was still unable to move, and the hissing in her
ears told her there was a change in pressure inside and outside the suit.

&nbsp;

It then dawned on her what was happening�the suit was
tightening around her.� First the gloves
began to pinch and grasp around her fingers, forcing joints in each finger to
pop into their respective, albeit stiffened places.� Because of the tightening, she found her
fingers now able to move again, yet she still appeared to be shackled at the
wrists.

&nbsp;

Air continued to be pressed out of the suit like a
flattening balloon, and soon her elbows could move, albeit slightly.� Just this simple process of feeling tight
freedom virtually overwhelmed her senses.

&nbsp;

Soon her shoulders were bound in the thick, yet now
flexible, rubber, which worked its way up around her neck in a tight ring.

&nbsp;

She discovered that not all joints in the suit would gain
motion once the suit tightened around her body, as her neck still appeared to
be restricted for the purpose of posture.�
The suit began to tighten down her spine and waist into what felt like a
semi-curved shape, forcing her chest outwards slightly and her back to be
somewhat, albeit naturally, curved.

&nbsp;

The latex molding tightened around her ass, making it round
and protruding, but that wasn�t the only discovery she found.� Strange large protruding objects that she
hadn�t noticed before were now being felt on the inside of her anal cavity and
vagina.� Like a pair of dildos, they
engaged her openings as soon as the suit clamped tight around the base of her
hips.� She could feel the objects plunging
deep into her cervix and anus, just as the large dildo in her mouth now
felt.� She now felt the pressure that had
been in the suit was now all but gone.

&nbsp;

What remained was that she was now completely filled with
dildo like objects, from her nose, mouth, anus, and vaginal area, yet still
able to breathe, all areas closed, yet open to her.� The level of penetration she felt was tremendous, and for some reason the situation excited her.

&nbsp;

She was now able to move her arms and legs, if only
somewhat, encased in the shiny rubber.�
Her heels, pinpoint and precariously balanced,
were still fused to the floor.� Her
wrists were still chained to the metal bars surrounding her.

&nbsp;

Due to the afforded movement, she was now able to view her
bearings somewhat, albeit in limited glances.�
She found that in order to view things around her, she was forced to
turn and bend at the hips with her legs, as everything upwards of her legs was
stiff and rock solid, neck included.� She
could bend her knees somewhat, but because her ballet heels were fused to the
floor, and her arms chained to the bars, she could only bend down so far
without simply hanging in semi-crouched suspended animation.

&nbsp;

Breathing through the rubber was a new sensation for her,
and she realized that it was now a part of who she was now.� She could literally take in oxygen from the rubber
dildo that had invaded her mouth and became a part of it.� Her tongue couldn�t move of course, and there
was little she could do with facial expressions hidden behind a rubber molded
face with a mouth fused shut with pretty rubber lips.

&nbsp;

Much to her surprise, the rubber skin she now wore appeared
to be much more sensitive to her intruders than previously discovered.� The inside of her mouth felt particularly
sensitive, yet at the same time, it felt very electric to touch the rubber
cylinder that fused with her mouth.� As
for her vagina�every few seconds now felt like an eternity of orgasm to
her.� The sensation traveled its way
through her uterus and back out her anus which was also plugged with sensitive
rubber material.

&nbsp;

This, she found, combined with the tightness of the suit
around her hips, caused her to virtually double over in exquisite pleasure�she
began to moan in muffled sobs as the suit seemed too much for her to bear.� She felt her knees buckle underneath the wave
and her arms held her up dangling aloft.

&nbsp;

Closing her eyes she was once again bombarded with the
images, this time the sensations combined with the orgasm appeared to feel like
a massive rush of pleasure to the very core of her brain.� It felt like an orgasm just to close her eyes
now.� And something inside of her, a
voice, called to her inner self�

&nbsp;

She was going to be a slut, and she was going to enjoy every
second of it.

&nbsp;

The more the voice called to her, the more she relented, it
began to sound like she herself wanted this more than the images or the voice
had told her.� They were all an extension
of herself now. 

&nbsp;

Time passed, and despite the constant sensations of orgasm
flooding her system, she felt her wetness to be a minor detail, the encasement
prevented any sort of leakage to begin with, and the very thought of being
inside this suit of pleasure was enough to stimulate her all over again.

&nbsp;

No longer was she able to think for herself�she could only
adjust to the throes of sensations her brain afforded her in that dark merciless
prison within a prison.� The rubber began
to become an extension of her own phallus, everything she touched was an
orgasm, and everything that was her, was who she was, was an orgasm.� Her heels felt like massive penises fused to
the floor, her fingers the very essence of penetration.� Her eyes an orgasm
in sight.� And her mind�s only use was to
process and savor each and every sensation she received through this strange
vibrant black rubber.

&nbsp;

She began to deliberately close her eyes to see the random
images again�she longed for them�she wanted them to become a part of who she
was desperately.� She would close her
eyes forever if her body afforded it.

&nbsp;

The images taught her how to become the ultimate slut.� They taught her bondage, the myriad
techniques of sex, of domination, of submission, and of how to be the sexiest
she could possibly be.� Somehow her mind
absorbed the information like a sponge, every detail was now memorized, she
even knew how to use a whip like an expert and run circles in those extreme
high heels of hers, despite having no prior training in them.

&nbsp;

She realized that she was now ready to take on the world,
whether it free her from this prison or not, she could
care less either way.� The world was her
orgasm, and she wanted to share it, or simply remain in this cage and enjoy
it�whatever the outcome, it would be pleasurable to her and she would do
whatever requirements were asked of her, because doing so meant she could
orgasm in her permanent rubber suit.

&nbsp;

Graciously, she (Sara was no longer her name, she answered
only to Rubber Slut), stood on the tips of her ballet heels, accepting the
resulting orgasm, and, quietly waited for the world�s response.

&nbsp;

She was ready.

&nbsp;

As if to answer, a set of metal locking bolts thumped through
the floor, this appeared to have been the mechanism that had locked her heels
in place.� She no longer cared of course,
but now she could pick up her heels and walk about the room.

&nbsp;

Next came the metal chains which were cuffed/fused to her
wrists, the chains fell away, but the cuffs remained, a silent reminder that
she was a lover of bondage.

&nbsp;

Turning her hips and glancing around her prison with rubbery
eyes, she realized she was free.� The
images that bombarded her eyes still remained, but they were now images of herself in orgasm, so she didn�t mind so much.

&nbsp;

A loud clank sounded and the cocoon that had been her prison
now opened, the bars separating themselves from the chamber, flooding light
into the darkness.� She was not afraid,
but she was ready for anything, everything.

&nbsp;

In tight hobble strides she exited her cocoon to become a
bondage butterfly slut.� Her black rubber
skin glistened in the light, her wetness of anticipation being an afterthought.

&nbsp;

The world�s orgasms would be hers for the taking.

&nbsp;

The End?
