A Sub\'s Delight
Provided By: BDSM Librarywww.bdsmlibrary.com
Synopsis: A short fatasy piece.







Here&#8217;s a small scenario.&nbsp; The room is lit only by the pale light of the moon streaming through window, falling languidly across your naked form. A beauty in the moonlight, but a there is more to you than just your form. Your hands and feet are secured to either end of the outfitted bench. You upper body resting securely across the cushions but your lower half hanging off and your legs bent at the knees and tied back against the legs of the chair. 
The moonlight casts a surreal glow on your features adding a specter of light to the room, but all that is lost as you cannot see any of it. There is a strong blind on your eyes, tied securely behind your head; you cannot see the moon or the light on your skin. Trapped in your darkened world awaiting the pleasure of your Dom.&nbsp; 

Feeling, like petals of light ignite your skin as you feel for the first time in what seems like hours a touch on your skin, your legs to be exact. A hand�no�just fingers, skimming up your leg, going ever higher up your body. A trance of patterns, feathery soft on your skin, now charged from the anticipation, from the waiting, the wanting�the need. Skimming now along your thighs, like the perfect dip of a majestic bird as its wings touch the surface of the lake. Teasingly soft, caressing your skin, raising goose bumps from their cool touch�no�its not fingers this time, you feel coolness lingering�no its wet�not a finger, but a tongue. Your mind body stiffens from the knowledge and how it sends a thrill through you. 

You are aware of how naked you are and you, and ho much closer and closer the tongue is getting to your tender lips. How the patterns seem to swirl on your skin, how light kisses dot your thighs, how tender suckles linger on your skin, going ever higher and higher. The feeling stirs in you, like flashes of light to your sightless eyes, rushing through your system, and your body shivers

Closer and closer you feel the lips, a short period of time but it feels like an eternity of anticipation, of need�please�please�please touch me there�.your mind screams your desires but no words escape your lips� you were instructed not to make a sound�but how can you hold back with all these sensations ripping blissfully through you. Your lips, those tender lips which were once closed are now beginning to open, your moistness slickening your rose petals, and begins to flow as a droplet from between them. The heat rises from your body, and you can feel yourself�yes deep within you feel yourself vibrate, your walls rubbing against each other�anticipating, needing�wanting�.

And you scream
The instant that tender lips are met by the wet touch of a tongue, licking, teasing at your entrance, your body arches against your bonds, and your eyes though covered pops open with the darkness. You moisture now flows freely, coaxed into a rivulet by the probing tongue. It pushes at them, teasing them open and they obey

You moan and rock your body, thrashing against your bonds...why�why won&#8217;t it go deeper, your lips open in welcome yet the tongue chooses to graze the outsides, the mouth chooses to nibble softly on your lips. But, you have not long to wait and with a sigh you feel the tongue of your Dom press against your lips, parting them as pressure is added and a fire ignites in you as it touches the slick surface of your inner walls. Maddening rush of pleasure engulfs you and screams inside you as my tongue dips deeper &#8211; delving&nbsp; - further, caressing the soft petals that are now open and licking at your juices. 
It has not ended, with an almost blinding flash you feel a thumb pressed against your clit�when did he find it�you think to yourself but it matters little now, all you can do is focus on your body, as your mind flits through each wonderful sensation that comes to you, the shivering intensity of your clit being toyed with, the numbing sweetness of my tongue inside you, licking and sucking on your lips, your inner walls and occasionally, flicking against your clit. 

Focus�focus�that&#8217;s all you can tell yourself as you thrash and quiver, pulling at your bonds, the feeling has reached its boiling point and can go no further, you need release, desperately�you contemplate begging for release but hold your tongue�your moans and screams have already violated you instructions enough already�but you need it so desperately, that release, that command from my lips�lips which are now currently driving your body to heights of pleasure and tong that is at the moment still delving into you. Your body twists and turns and the momentum builds and builds, growing in intensity and fervor &#8211; for a brief second there is regret and relief as the tongue leaves you but that is quickly replaced and you back arches higher than before, your mouth opens in silent screams as you feel a finger�no two being pushed into you. And at the same time my lips converge and trap your clit so that my tongue can flick across its surface, teasing electricity through you and the fingers�oh god the fingers�they are now pumping into you, slow at first but building, grow more intense, harder..harder..faster�faster�*

Your mind is a mass of ecstasy on the brink and then you hear the words�the words you crave so much..

�cum, now�
