Something to help the dreams along.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Have you ever felt so totally absorbed by a single
person you wish you could mould your body so it became part of theirs?

Have you ever trusted someone so utterly and
completely you would have laid your life in their hands?

Have you ever felt a bond with someone so strong that
you knew it was always going to be something much more than just 'love'?

�Within the
words written here you will become to understand how such a bond is formed and
how it can change your life forever as mine was once changed.

�I ask you now
to open your mind, body and soul so that all the information before you is
accepted and understood in the context of which it was meant.

Imagine the sun beating down unsparingly on the tight
tanned flesh that surrounds my body; imagine the waves as they softly lap over
my toes while I walk. Now feel me as I am glancing into the distance and seeing
someone, seeing someone whom I have never met but from the moment I lay my eyes
on him I have total recognition. Even before I spoke to the stranger I felt as
if I had known him for years.

I watched his lips move as he spoke to me;
occasionally I glanced down to see the golden reflection of the sun on his
toned masculine form. I couldn�t help myself and I felt my crotch wetten in an
instant. 

�we talked for
hours as we walked along that lonely sun kissed beach, never in my life had I
gone off with a stranger but like I said before, from the moment I first laid
my eyes on him I felt like I had known him an eternity. He told me about how he
had been at the beach several times just to see if I was there so he could
watch me. He explained he had waited many days and nights just hoping for a
glimpse of me. This was the first time he had had the courage to speak to me in
person. I heard how he had also got the same feeling from me as I had from him
the first time he saw me, and how he had wanted nothing but to speak to me from
that single moment in time.

I didn�t know what this meant, I hadn�t a clue where
it was going to lead, all I knew was I wanted to see him again and the first
night we parted although we had done nothing else but talk and walk, it killed
me, I felt although my soul was being ripped from the inside out. The parting
hurt me mentally as well as physically. The rest of the night all I could was
toss and turn while I thought about him. Pictures of him flashed through my
eyes every time I tried to close them.

Inevitably with me being as hot and restless as I was,
my fingers began to wander. I pictured his strong masculine arms holding me,
literally crushing the life from within me as he touched my body delicately
with his other hand. I moved my fingers to where I imagined his touch and began
caressing myself.

&nbsp;

�All my life I
had fantasised about a man who owned me completely, a man who would love me and
hurt me at the same time. I needed someone who knew my thoughts, my feelings
and desires. I needed someone who would take control of me and find my limits
then push them to the brink. I wanted that someone to know every inch of my
body as though it where it his own, someone who could make me bend to his every
desire either with force or without.

�My fingers
moved across my glistening breasts, the sweat began to seep through every pore
in my skin, soaking my white satin linen as my fingers began to make my tight
well trimmed pussy do the same. I ran my left hand from my neck to my breasts,
as my right hand tendered to the most important part, making my back arch and
the blood surge to every little corner of my being. I felt the overwhelming
power of the throbbing as it intensified deep within my damp wet crotch, I
couldn�t hold out much longer and under the cool breeze of the midnight moon I
released the power within me, falling limply back onto my bed I closed my eyes
and awaited the magnificent dreams I knew would beset my mind the second my
body shut down.

�The following
day as I picked out my wardrobe all I could think of was the amazing sex my
mind had been having with the stranger all night. My still soaking wet crotch
was wondering whether the real thing would be just as good and satisfying.

�Walking down
the street where we had planned to meet I felt the dampness seeping into the
gusset of my thong. I knew in a few seconds I would catch a glimpse of him and
the thought drove me wild with desire.

There he stood on the corner, black trousers and a two
tone black shirt, the light shimmering off it as he moved round impatiently
waiting to catch his first glimpse of me.

�He saw me as I
approached and walked towards me.

&quot;do you trust me?&quot; he said, rubbing my arms
lightly and coming in close enough for me to almost kiss his lips but neither
of us wanted to make the first move an so there we stood in� our pose waiting for the other to push the
boundaries.

&quot;yes I trust you&quot; I answered, I knew I
trusted him, I know I shouldn�t have done since we had only just met and he
could be anyone, but my instincts were so overwhelmingly strong I had no other
choice but to follow them. I took his hand and he led me round the corner.

�There on the
side of the road was a yellow soft top porche, &quot;your chariot awaits my
lady&quot; he said as he opened the door and helped me inside.

I hadn�t exactly dressed to be sat in a car; the dress
I was wearing was very thin, very flimsy and extremely short. As I took my seat
I tried to pull the hem down but to no avail. The crotch of my panties was just
visible if viewed from the right angle, and where he was going to be sitting
was exactly the right angle. My knees where high as the metal heels on my red
shoes where very tall and that dictated how my tanned legs looked. Even if I do
say so myself I felt and looked extremely sexy. The only thought that ran
through my head was please don�t touch me. It wasn�t that I didn�t want him to
touch me quiet the opposite, but I knew if he did then my thong would be so
soaking wet that it would run onto the warm leather seats and be visible if at
any time I was required to leave my seat.

After seating himself he turned on the engine, I heard
it roar but most importantly I felt the vibrations of the engine through the
seats. As each of the cylinders fired I could feel the pulsating throb of the
engine start to work its way inside me. If I could have closed my eyes for a
few seconds and touched myself I would have exploded.

As he revved up the engine I could almost feel myself
falling over the edge of sheer ecstasy, he put the car into gear and just
before he pulled off he touched my leg and asked me if I was ok. The only sound
I could make was a very agreeable mmmmmmmm as my soft sweet pussy was thrown
into the pangs of a wild intense orgasmic rush.

�That was it, we
were racing down the highway with the wind rushing through my hair, my body was
completely satisfied yet the hunger for him wasn�t. I wanted more, I wanted to
feel him inside me. I wanted to dig my nails into the soft toned flesh of his
back and rip it slowly downward as he pumps me into overdrive, filling my
entire body with his.

�We drove all
day, stopping only once for some dinner at a quaint little coffee shop near the
sea front. Around 7ish we were feeling peckish again, he suggested we grab some
stuff for a picnic and go sit on the beach with it as the sun began to set.

�I had spent the
whole day conversing with him, we had literally told each other almost
everything about ourselves in the short time we had known each other.

After grabbing the stuff for the picnic we pulled up
along the boulevard facing the sea, took our picnic and sat on the bench near
the car and tucked in.

�It wasn�t long
before the conversation turned to fantasies and the things we both liked doing
in the bedroom. I was so shocked to discover that they ran along very similar
lines that I poured my heart out to him. I disclosed my most deepest darkest
fantasies.

The whole talk about sex was driving me wild, I
watched sun as it slowly sunk into the sea. I knew that before the last rays of
light had completely disappeared my thrust for him would be quenched.

I set my drink down beside me and as I turned around
to look at him again he grabbed my face and kissed me. Our first kiss was as
romantic as any first kiss could be, but I knew he knew what I wanted. I
grabbed his face and reciprocated the passionate kiss that was his queue.

He grabbed me under my arms and hoisted me onto the
bonnet of his car. Spinning me round he hitched up my dress and pinned me down.
I was wild with frantic passion and lifted my knee up high holding it in place
as he inserterd his stiff thick cock deep inside my gushing cunt.

Ramming my head onto the cold steel of the bonnet he
proceeded to thrust himself deeper and deeper inside me, yanking my hair back
occasionally to look at my face then forcing it heavily back down. I shuddered slightly
as he pulled out, he could feel me tighten up and wasn�t prepared to let me cum
just yet. I felt his huge erect end as it lingered for a while near my anal
opening, the gritted my teeth slightly as he used the sticky sweet juices from
my pulsating throbbing pussy to lube the hole, before slowly pushing himself
deep inside my tight clenched ass.

�I could feel
myself getting closer and closer towards the edge and I franticly tried to
thrash out with my arms, trying hopelessly in vain to find something to cling
onto as the waves of utter pleasure and delight swept over my whole body,
touching every part of my being from the top of my head to the tip of my toes.

Just the waves were beginning to pass I felt him swell
as he began to reach his peak, I grasped his arms tightly as he pumped my ass
full of his warm sticky juice.

We both slid into a heap on the floor at the foot of
his car. Both breathless and totally and utterly satisfied. There we lay for a
while just talking and touching and caressing, totally oblivious to anything
that was happening around us.

Although the sun had made its departure the night air
was still warm, with both of our bodies still covered in each others sticky
remenance of the passionate act which had just taken place, he suggested we go
for a swim. Standing up he took my hand and pulled me to my feet. Picking me up
and launching me over his shoulders he proceeded to jog down to the waters
edge. Setting me down carefully he ran his fingers across the buttons which
were at the front of my dress and began strategically opening each one in turn.
I turned my attention to his shirt and did the same.

Once we were both naked we held each others hands as
we took our first careful steps into the midnight blue ocean. The water was so
cool and refreshing, each wave lapping higher and higher up my waist line as we
proceeded further into the murky depths. He wrapped his hands around my waist
and lifted me from the waters, then smiled as he lowered me back down making me
glide across his chest. Is I was being lowered I felt his cock harden and
opened my legs accordingly. As he let me down slowly I felt the tip of his hard
pulsating rod enter me. A smile crept across my face as its full entirety was
finally inserted. He was using his whole upper body strength to lift me up and
down onto him, at the same time I was using my nails, digging them into his
flesh, each wave of the ocean controlling the waves of total delight which ran
untetherd through my body.

The heat was seeping off our bodies in a cloud of
steam as we walked casually to shore. Holding me tightly in his grasp, our
steaming wet bodies entwined with one another as we made our way back to the
car.

The drive home was silent. The only words spoken were
the fits of laugher and giggles breaking out from within each of us
occasionally as we recalled the actions we had taken that day.

�He drove me to
my front door, kissed my cheek softly and whispered into my ear �same time
tomorrow?�

�Wouldn�t miss it for the world� I replied.

As soon as I got in I climbed limply from within my
damp clothes, rubbed my hair out of its clasp and went for a long cool shower.
I didn�t feel the need for a bath I wanted to have something of him remaining
when I retired to me bed for the evening. Something to help the dreams along.

�We had
exchanged phone calls the previous evening but as I was meeting him in less
than an hour I was indeed not expecting him to call me, before I answered the
phone I saw it was him calling me. All that could go through my mind was �what
if he�s calling to cancel� �what if he thinks I�m a cheep dirty little slut who
sleeps with anyone on the second day they meet them� all I kept repeating to
myself before I pressed the accept on the phone was �please god don�t let him
be blowing me off, for gods sake, I think I love him�.

�Hello� I said shakily when I answered the phone
finally,

�Morning, and how are you sexy on this fine morning� I
heard his deep sexy voice reply,

�Very, very well now gorgeous� I answered.

�Do you remember that long conversation we had about
our fantasies and that evening?� he asked

�Yes I do very very well, I am still dripping from
it.� I replied.

�Did you mean every word you said to me?� he asked

�Yes of course I did I have no reason on this earth to
lie to you, in any manner shape or form� I replied, kind of confused by now

�Do you trust me?� he said, those fatal words, the
words he had used once before, I had trusted him once before and I saw no
reason to doubt him now.

�Of course I do� I replied.

�Can you wear a black vest, a black thong, stockings
and black heels, underneath a long coat and nothing else?� he asked his
requirements where odd to say the least, but I saw no outward reason to deny
him his little pleasures.

�I will wear whatever pleases you� I replied, trying
to sound as humble as I could.

�See you soon sexy� I said in his low husky sexy
voice.

�I�m looking forward to it� I replied.

The door bell couldn�t go soon enough for me and when
it did I was stood behind it waiting for him. I opened the door and let him
gain entrance to my abode. Kissing my cheek softly again he whispered in my ear
�do you trust me?�

This time I laughed and gave him my usual reply �of
course�.

Gathering something from his pocket he grabbed my
shoulders and spun me round so I was facing away from him, I felt his hands
move up my body and I looked down to see what it was he was holding. I had no
sooner got a glimpse of the artefact which he held in his hands before he had
placed it around my eyes and I was thrown into complete darkness. Relying
entirely on his touch and guidance I was led carefully to the car and placed
into the passenger seat.

The drive was longer than I had anticipated and well
before we reached our destination my bladder was shouting at me for a release.
I dared not say a word to him, I don�t know why I didn�t but I secretly enjoyed
the intense emotions I was receiving from being his captive.

When the car finally rolled to a stop my bladder was
fit to burst. Crossing my legs to the best of my ability I carefully removed
myself from the vehicle, with his help of course.

There I stood at the side of the car while he left me.
I thought I heard another mans voice, then it was confirmed he was speaking
with someone, they where whispering but by now my other senses had begun to
take over from my eyes and I could just about make out what he said. I recall
the conversation to go something like this.

�That her then?� said the new voice in my midst,

�Yes, isn�t she just everything I told you she was?�
he said,

�ow yes and much, much more. I must admit she is
definitely a cut above the rest� said the stranger.

�isn�t she just, promise me that not a hair on� her head will be hurt beyond her capacity,
don�t get me wrong I want you to push her limits and train her how I require,
but please no marks, I have a surprise for her later� he said. This was kind of
comforting but at the same time the idea of �training� I must admit scared me a
little.

�you can trust me with both your life and hers
brother, have I ever disappointed you?�, so it was confirmed, he was his
brother, either that or very, very close to him.

I felt new heavier arms clasping round my shoulders, a
strong guiding arm leading me into the unknown.

Pushing his fingers underneath my arms he guided them
slowly upward over my head. When he let me go I kept my arms in the position he
had put them in. I know I could have struggled and made a real fuss about my
predicament but I must admit that it was such a turn on, I just wanted to do as
I was told. All I wanted to do was please.

I felt a tether of some kind being slipped round and
round my wrists, holding me securely. The cool feel of the bindings ran through
my body churning my stomach with both ecstasy and anxiety. I could feel the
gusset of my tight black thong dampen instantly as his heavy breath caressed my
skin as it flowed over, causing goose bumps to prick up as it went. 

Then I felt the cool air slowly begin to work its way
down my arms across my stomach, then gradually it worked its way to my crotch,
I felt it blow keenly across the damp patch in my panties and inside me the
insatiable throbbing sensations began.

Just as I was starting to topple over the edge the
cool rush of air started to work its way down across my inner thighs, past my
now quivering knees even further now, working its way right down the very tip
of my toes. The feeling was unbelievably amazing. Never before have I ever felt
anything like without the actual act of physical touch.

I felt new fresh bindings being placed around my
ankles, I knew from this point onwards my life was in his hands. I made the
decision there and then to trust his brother as implicitly as I trusted him, a
decision I knew I could never retract before it was too late. All I could do
was to hang there and hope I had placed my trust on someone deserving enough to
receive it.

My eyes where blinded for quiet some time once the
blindfold was removed from my face.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�It took a while
for my eyes to adjust to the light, when they had I was able to view my
capturer first hand. He was quite a large man, balding slightly but it didn�t
make him unattractive, not in the slightest, ok so he wasn�t even a shadow of
his brother but he was in his own right quiet sexy.

I lent forward a little, bending my body slightly in
the hope it made my figure ever more sexy, before I gave him the cutest smile I
could physically muster.

I eyed him up and down and he came in closer to me to
have a good look at my eyes, he seemed pleased with what he saw. At a quick
glance around the room I couldn�t see my man any where. This put me on edge a
little I must admit, now I was totally alone and strung up like a prize turkey.
Although I have to admit it must have made my tattoo look surprisingly arousing
and tempting, I was hoping that what it said would be happening.

Lickable��� hey what do you recon?.

�I see you are attired exactly how I ordered, you may
please me yet� he said. That was the thought that finally hit me, I had already
pleased his brother, what if he really wanted to �do� me so to speak. The
thought of actually having to have sex with this man had never crossed my mind
until that moment in time, sexy as he was though the thought still made me want
to heave. No matter how I could put it I knew I didn�t want to disappoint him
but then again I didn�t ever want to be unfaithful to my new found love,
especially with his brother.

Amazing how it may sound that thought went completely
out the window the second he approached me again and went up behind me. At that
moment yet again all I wanted to do was please. I arched my back slightly to
allow him access to all my �major� points, held my breath slightly and shut my
eyes, as he proceeded to lift my vest up exposing my breasts.(03-04-05)

How I enjoyed his delectable touch as he ran his
fingers across my nipples, cupping my breasts slightly, teasing me pinching my
nipples slightly between his thumb and forefinger, occasionally nibbling on
them to make the shivers of sheer lust curse through my body.

Then the play began to get harder, the slight pinching
became more of a clamping and the nibbling to a biting, he was watching my face
for my reactions as he went along his work. He enjoyed it when I was squinting
in pain, and I knew it.

He was watching every movement on my face, every curve
and expression I was showing he was well in touch with. I knew he could have
done as he pleased with me but he chose to take things slowly and have fun with
me. Now fun is something I can do. I decided there and then to set myself a
precedence, something which id never even thought of before, maybe, just maybe
this is what he wanted, if it was then I would please both him and his brother
as long as I remained solely his.

The breast play was such a turn on, it was sending
feelings down my body like short light bolts of electricity and each one made
my skin stand up in miniature goose bumps as his fingers caressed me.(08-09-10)

As I nibbled on the tip of my erect nipple he would
spank my ass, sometimes lightly and sometimes much more meaningful. It was the
not knowing which was to come next which turned me on more than the feeling of
the spanking itself, but the power he was holding over me was the ultimate way
into manipulating my every move.

One of the slaps stung my right buttock so much I
pulled away slightly tugging at my bonds. The disappointment in his face for
those few momentary seconds cut so deep inside me I felt ashamed of my actions,
even if they weren�t to be helped.

He walked over to a table and threw back a cover,
revealing to me several artefacts of what I can only describe as torture
instruments. He spent a few moments considering his next move before deciding
on a plan of action, picking up one of the instruments and came back over to
where I hung.

Slowly and with evil intent he placed clamps with a
chain connecting them to my nipples. As each clamp was put into place he
squeezed it hard, not to make sure it was secure but simply just to add to my
torment.

At first the feel of the chains was nice, the cool
metal complemented my skin. It made me feel hot and horney but also submissive
and under his control. The teasing was the worst part for me at the start, he
would run his fingers all the way down one side of my body and then use his
tongue for feeling me up the total length of the other. My back would arch and
my body would twist in a thousand different ways trying to get that one quick
rub over the area I knew would push me over the edge. The problem is he knew it
would push me over the edge and made sure all his touches and caresses where always
just outside that particular area.

Then he began tugging on the chains, pulling it down,
further and further, pushing my limits as I gritted my teeth waiting for the
next painful tug. The tugs got so hard and so Sharpe they where getting
unbearable, then as if he had planned exactly which tug it was going to be I
screamed out. He had been waiting for that moment. The smile on his face spread
over him like a curtain in an instant. I had given him the excuse he had
required without even knowing it. Now my ordeal was only going to get worse,
now the teasing was only going to intensify and now the smile on his face could
only get bigger and better.

He walked causally over to that table of horrors and
without pausing to take stock or decide which of the contraptions to use he
just grabbed the one item on there he knew he wanted and came back to me. The
object he had chosen turned out to be a ball gag, this was instantly placed in
my mouth, holding my jaw open in a gaping fashion.

The gag hurt my mouth, it stretched the skin of my
lips and made my jaw ache. There was nothing I could do though but put up with
the implementation of my torture.

Although the gag was making my mouth ache and my lips
sting it did however muffle my screams and moans, both good and bad. Mostly
more good though as, as soon as he had the gag inside my mouth he let up a
little on the hard play and concentrated mainly on the pleasing almost to the
point of no return. It felt like hours as he played with each and every part of
my body in turn, Making sure not to miss a single inch or crevice as he became
intimately familiar with every point.

�You please me greatly� he finally said to me.

�I would like for you to please me to the best of your
ability, all I want from you is for you to stand still while I bind you the way
a female should be bound.� He asked me; well to be honest when he put this to
me I had no idea exactly what he wanted, all I knew was that I wanted to please
him, I wanted to give him everything to make him happy.

�Of course Master, anything you wish sir� I replied
with as much conviction I could muster without sounding condescending. I mean
how could I honestly reply unless I had clear instruction or even some idea of
what it was he actually wanted me to do.

�I stood for him
regardless and to my immense relief all he actually wanted to do was a little
playing with the rope. How the course fibres tugged at my skin but I stood for
him as he bound me.

I watched the smile on his face grow and grow as he
was completing his task. When the task was complete he stood back to admire his
work. The look on his face guaranteed me that I had done exactly what he had
wished and pleased him.

There I stood till my knight returned, in all my
glory. The look on his face also assured me I had done exactly as he had wished
as well.� 

The bindings stayed in place as I was given my reward,
from both of them.
