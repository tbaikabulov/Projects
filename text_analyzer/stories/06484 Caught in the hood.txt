Synopsis: This cute little tease gets what she deserves






This is in fact my very first story, based loosely on a play with my former girlfriend. I wrote it for a beautiful, brave Californian girl that has a most interesting website. For some weeks I mailed with her but lost contact. She&#8217;s still out there however, tied and left for you to find. She&#8217;s the cutest thing in ropes you ever saw and if you do find her, please be gentle with her and tell her hello from me�

As for the story, it is perhaps a bit on the soft side and I am still in doubt by the changing of the point of view and about the dialogues. Just let me know what you think about it.

Caught in the hood.

We are having our long weekend at the cabin, and you have been playfully provoking me all day. However I simply wasn't in the mood and every time you try you don&#8217;t succeed in luring me into our �fights� you love so much &#8211; especially when you have to surrender. After the next mild quarrel you walk away disappointed, mumbling and grumbling to yourself.&nbsp; You grab your hooded sweatshirt, pull it over your head only to notice you put it on backwards!&nbsp; That now, is an opportunity to good to pass!! Quickly I grab the hood, pull it over your head and with a fast tug on the drawstring I secure it. 

�Hey, come on, let me go!� you shout and try to pull the hood of your head. However you feel me holding on to the drawstring, and your grasping and tugging only tightens the hood.&nbsp; Now effectively blinded you are no match for me when I wrestle you down to the ground on your stomach, pinning your arms under you. Quickly I wrap the rope of the drawstring under your chin and back and tie a not. 

You start struggling again, reaching for the knot but you cannot prevent me from wrapping a bootlace around your wrist &#8211; the sleeve of your hoodie protecting your skin. Despite your struggling, and grunting you feel me pulling the ropes through the pouch of your hoodie that is now on your back. Your tugging cannot prevent me pulling on of your wrists through that pouch and tying your wrists together, then pushing both of your wrists back in the pouch and tying the rest of the laces around that pouch. You're tied, hooded and helpless as you lay panting on the ground.&nbsp; 

�All right, all right, you caught me. Satisfied now you&#8217;ve proven you&#8217;re the strong guy catching the little girl? � you say, still struggling a bit. 
I can&#8217;t resist some slaps on your bottom and help you up �come on girl, you&#8217;ve been asking for this the whole day, didn&#8217;t you?
�
I can feel you have surrendered when I pick you up and knot another rope to the drawstring under your chin, effectively leashing you. "Come on, you've captured me fair and square. I'm not going anywhere,&nbsp; there's no need to leash me like a dog" you plead.&nbsp; 
"I'm not so sure about that, girl, you were pretty defiant this whole afternoon. Besides, it's not up to you anymore, �now is it?"


I hear some grumbling under the hood, but you stop your pleading, waiting for what is to come. I let you stand there for a while, adoring your looks. Your pretty nose�sticking out in�the hood shows me you 're still trying to�"look around"� and the way your hands are tied�makes you present your breasts. And you simple look adorable, panting, wriggling, tied, helpless in your sweatpants and hoodie. Almost to cute to resist the urge to take you right here, right now!


You have no idea what I am doing while you stand there. Uncertain you take a few step only to feel a tug on your leash, making it clear I won&#8217;t let you walk away. �Better stand still girl or you might trip� you hear me say. Then it is quiet again. You hear some noise around you but you&#8217;re completely surprised by my fingers tickling you under your ribcage. �Please don&#8217;t� you gasp but soon you collapse in helpless laughter under the onslaught of my fingers on your body. 

�Come on, you bastard, cut it out� you yell in between laughs. And indeed I stop instantly! �Now, that&#8217;s not nice to say, not nice at all� you hear me saying and you feel me taking your elbow. 

�Since I am such a bastard, I think I will leave you on your own for a while. But since I have some things to do it&#8217;s only fair that YOU will have to leave for I while. So, lets go for a walk now" and you start your helpless struggles again. Pleading �Ok, ok, I&#8217;m sorry, shouldn&#8217;t have called you a bastard.�&nbsp; 
�You should&#8217;ve thought about that before, girl�
�Please, don&#8217;t take me outside like this, please, I&#8217;m sorry. I will never ever call you bastard again� you continue to plead, now really getting frightened as you feel me slowly walking you around. 

"Come on, don't be shy" I encourage you and start walking you outside our cabin. You feel the soft grass on your feet and hear me closing the door and almost panic. �Come on, this isn&#8217;t funny anymore, let me go� you grunt but I know better than to stop now�.You try one last desperate plea �please, let me go, I&#8217;ll make it up to you, I really will, but please don&#8217;t leave me outside like that, ok, pretty please?�

I must admit it almost is too endearing, but I notice you are also really excited. So, holding your arm and leash I walk slowly further, every now and then&nbsp; turning you around to disorientate you. You have stopped your pleading, knowing it is useless &#8211; and of course there is that pride of yours, not wanting me to gloat on your fears. You are a one proud woman!
�
After some time you are turned around and around and then stopped. You feel some tugging on your rope leash and a quick tug pulls down your sweatpants. You hear me order you to lift your feet, taking the pants of you. "Albright now, you'll stay here while I go back to the cabin for a nice cold soda. I'll pick you up later. Behave girl!". You try to turn around but notice you are tethered by your leash.
You yell some angry words at me, and then decide to plead and beg, but to no avail while you hear my footsteps disappear. You have no idea how endearing your pleas are to my ears, how hard it is to leave you, but�..
�
�..there you are: your hands tied behind your back with no way to get them in front and even wriggling them is hard. The soft sweater hugging your body. That hood is not only an effective blindfold; it softens sounds and makes you breathing harder &#8211; and your breathing sounds reverberate in the hood. 

You haven't a clue to wherever you are. As far as you know, you may be standing next to main trail or the parking lot of the park!! Your feet feel a bit around with your feet, but that damn leash limits your range of motion severely. You do feel however a pole in front of you and you carefully step to it. You try to turn around, succeed, but that damn pouch makes it impossible to get a good feel and it seems the rope is tied to high. Gently you kneel down, softly pulling at your leash to get it down so your hands might reach the knot. You stand up again but still can&#8217;t feel the leash or the knots. 

You keep kneeling, turning, tugging on your leash, getting more desperate by the minute. Increasing the struggles in the pouch, shaking your head to get that hood of &#8211; knowing better, but you're just sooo frustrated and helpless &#8211; and yes, frightened too, so your can't resist the urge. You almost start yelling, but then realise that certainly would attract people &#8211; but just what would they do to you?&nbsp; What if�??&nbsp; So you continue to struggle, pulling on that leash, grunting, cursing me in your thoughts and vowing revenge. Meanwhile you can&#8217;t deny your excitement growing, keeping pace with your growing fears�.you can feel your pussy getting wet, your panties getting moist, your breathing more and more intense. 
�
You have lost all sense of time when you hear footsteps approaching you. Immediately you stop your struggling, standing still, listening as good as that hood permits it. The feet stop walking; your hart starts pounding in your throat. You feel hands caressing your breasts, and you're simply to scared to yell so you just freeze while these hands keep caressing you, tender, lovingly, gently stroking your body and drifting downwards way to your nether regions. You hope it&#8217;s me, almost sure it must be me, but soooo scared�.. Your breathing gets heavy and almost in a whisper you ask&nbsp; "Rowen?" Then louder "ROWEN?!" 
�
"Yes, my love, did you miss me?" There is so much relief in your sigh while you feel your muscles relax. You&#8217;re not really angry with me, but of course you have to tell me that this was a mean prank. And I promise to make it up to you, telling you I'll untie your leash and take you home with me. You ask me to take the hood off, but I refuse, explaining that it would ruin your surprise. Mumbling you let me lead you a few steps after which you feel me putting you on my lap. 

You feel my hands stroking you, caressing your body and my hands concentrate on your breasts and pussy. Even though you're very excited you pant "are you crazy, what if someone walks in to us? "
�That won&#8217;t happen, girl. Besides, bound and hooded as you are, you have no choice! Just let it happen and enjoy the ride, girl" you hear me whispering in your ear. 

Exhausted as well as safe in my arms you can&#8217;t keep up the fight anymore and you go with to flow. Soon you're moaning, struggling,&nbsp; approaching your climax &#8211;&nbsp; only to feel me slow down on you. You plead with me to let you cum to no avail and you&#8217;re kept on that edge. Finally your sweet pleading and begging gets the best of me and I push you over the edge and your body literally explodes,&nbsp; than almost falling limp on me. 

�Are you OK, luv?&nbsp; You hear me ask. "Never better" you drowsily reply while I untie your hood and pull it down &#8211; so you can see that all this time you were in the back garden of our cabin.&nbsp; 
"OMG, that was soooo mean" you whisper, but your smile tells different. "Yes, I had a most interesting sight this evening. You look really cute struggling on a leash, did you know that?"&nbsp; You are almost sleeping and reply with an "uh-huh". I cut the ropes on your wrists and gently pick you up, you wrapping your arms around my neck, resting your head on my chest,&nbsp; while I carry you to our bed. Slowly I lay you down on the bed and while you fold yourself into a little ball&nbsp; you feel me covering you with a blanket, tenderly stroking your sweaty hair, feeling you drifting asleep &#8211; still wearing the sweatshirt backwards. Now, how much of coincidence was this really???
