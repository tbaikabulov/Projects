Synopsis:   Two long-time friends decide to take their relationship a step (or two) further). Will be updated sporadically.







"Remind me why we're doing this again?" 
Aaron eyed the stairs warily, scoping for late-night drunks or anyone else wandering down that particular street at 3 AM.

"Because," Jack grunted as he hooked his fingers around the screen frame and pulled,
"I just wanna make sure we didn't leave anything." 

Aaron rolled his eyes and shoved his hands deeper into his jacket, fidgeting with his lighter, waiting for Jack to finish the obviously illegal re-entry into their former apartment.
Without a twitch, Jack caught the screen before it fell, set it quietly on the ground and threw one long leg over the window sill. Aaron caught the wild, almost childish gleam in his eye as he whispered "Meet you at the door?" and nodded towards the back hall. 

Aaron shook his head, unable to keep from smiling at the sheer randomness this guy possessed, and headed around the corner to the front door. They'd given up the apartment a week ago, sick of dealing with scumbag tenants and screeching kids, and moved to a much bigger (and infinitely nicer) two bedroom nearby. 

Jack swung the front door open as Aaron rounded the corner, giving him his trademarked "I did something bad and it was fun" smile. Aaron pushed him aside and shut the door quietly, unconsciously breathing a sigh of relief to be in. Looking around the apartment, empty of any of their stuff, Aaron felt a twinge of homesickness. In the short time they'd spent there, they'd managed to make a lot of memories. 

"Aaron, what's on your mind?" Jack nudged Aaron with his pack of cigarettes, light eyebrows rising in concern. "Is he still on your mind?" 
Aaron shook his head, realized he'd been staring at the stupid tree that blocked the window and turned around to Jack, smiling a bit. "No, fuck no. Fuck him, he was an asshole anyway..."

Jack pulled out his lighter and lit Aaron's cigarette and then his own, comfortably flopping down onto the bare wooden floor under the window. Aaron slid down next to him, his legs stretching out into the tiny patch of streetlight able to get through the thick leaves. 

"Y'know, I had my own lighter." 
Jack shrugged, grinning. "I know, I was being a gentleman." They chuckled, drew in lungful of smoke and leaned back in comfortable, companionable silence.

After a few minutes, Aaron snickered and leaned over to Jack. 
"Hey, now that you've got a nice big apartment to show off, are you finally going to try and find a girl who'll fuck ya?"

Jack glared back, blowing a plume of smoke into Aaron's face.
"First off, WE'VE got a nice big apartment to show off. You're ON the damn lease now, Aaron."

He paused and drew in another breath of smoke, still looking in Aaron's direction.

"And? What about second? You said first for a reason, fucker." Aaron smirked, waiting for Jack's response.

"Well...hm. Come on Aaron, you know I'm awful at meeting girls and all that...bullshit." Jack, for all of his good humor and general charm, was intimidating to most people he met. He blamed it on his natural loudness and over-opinionated nature, Aaron told him it was a gift and an asshole deterrent. Jack sighed and sagged his shoulders, butting the cigarette near the base of the floorboards.
"It does suck, though."

"Hm? What, that you're not getting sucked?" Aaron snickered, raising an eyebrow. 
Jack paused, started to say something and just laughed. "Yeah, exactly." 
They looked at each other for a minute and both laughed, Jack covering his mouth to stifle his insanely loud laughter. They quieted down and sat for a while longer, listening to the steady sound of cars coming and going, of the branches swishing and scraping across the windows.

"It's a shame, man..." Aaron almost whispered, looking over at Jack.
"What, me not getting any?" Jack asked, leaning in to hear Aaron.

"I could take care of it for you, y'know..." Aaron mumbled after a long, almost awkward pause. He looked back towards the window again, not wanting Jack to see him blush like a damn girl. 
Jack laughed quietly and sucked in a deep breath, reaching out for Aaron's hand. 

"I thought you said...you didn't want to risk ruining things, awkwardness and all that shit?" 

Aaron's fingers curled around Jack's, resting against his wrist. He wondered for a second if Jack felt his pulse quicken, if he noticed the way his heart was pounding. He inched closer to Jack, still not looking at him out of sheer embarrassment.

"Jack, after all the shit we've been through, dealt with, lived through...I don't even think we could feel awkward with each other. I mean, fuck's sake man, we've slept in the same bed on and off for years."

Jack laughed, shrugging and nodding. "That's true, and I've seen your ass enough times."
They both laughed this time, Aaron risking a look towards Jack. 

"I'm serious, J.&nbsp; The thought's crossed my mind...more than a few times." 
Aaron bit his lip, hoping the shadows would hide his flush, torn between the terror of rejection and ruining his friendship. 

Jack slipped an arm around Aaron, pulling his head towards him. "And you think I haven't? You know I'm...open about shit. Hell, I've kissed you before. And regardless, I love you man. I don't think this would change anything..."

Aaron stared back at Jack, feeling his eyes well up, wondering how he'd managed across a friend this amazing, a guy who wouldn't laugh or be disgusted at the sheer idea of this. After what seemed like an hour, Jack took a long, deep breath and whispered "Fuck it. Good timing's overrated, all that jazz" and grabbed hold of Aaron's hair. 
Before Aaron could gasp or say anything, he sealed his mouth over Aaron's and slipped his tongue into his mouth. 

Aaron twitched and moaned against Jack's lips, grabbing his hand tighter and sucking at his mouth. Jack's fingers trailed down Aaron's neck, brushing just under his hairline and sending a fresh wave of chills down Aaron's back. Jack finally broke the kiss, eyes blazing and whispered to Aaron "Are you sure about this?"

Aaron nodded, his chest hitching with each breath, his pants feeling terribly tight. Jack all but lunged at him, pinning him against the wall and kissed him again, stubble scraping at Aaron's face. Their arms slid up and curled around each other, Jack's hands back in Aaron's thick hair, tugging softly and then harder. Aaron broke the kiss this time, gasping and pulling off Jack's shirt.

"J, I've wanted to do this longer than you know. Yes, I'm completely fucking sure about this."
Aaron pushed Jack back on the floor, pulling off his belt and half unzipping his pants as he did. Jack closed his eyes and let him, fingers feeling for Aaron's free hand as he eased his boxers down. Aaron sat still for a second, staring down at his best friend, at a man he'd once called his brother but discarded that term, feeling it still couldn't touch whatever it was they'd found in each other. 

'Love' sounded too simple, 'best friends' infinitely too petty. 'Soul mates' sounded clichï¿½, but it was the closest description he could find in words to this fantastic, strange thing they'd made. 

He flicked his tongue out, over Jack's hard on and watched him shudder. "How long has it been?" He whispered, licking his fingers and brushing them over Jack's balls.

"Two...fucking...years." Jack gasped. 

Aaron grinned and leaned down, drawing his tongue slowly over Jack's cock, teasing the tip.

"Why didn't you ask me sooner?" He mumbled, brushing his teeth over the tip.

Jack shuddered and moaned quietly, grabbing hold of Aaron's hair.
"Because I was a fucking pussy, I don't know why! We're doing it now though, so...shut up and do it!" 

Aaron laughed, started to say something and was silenced by Jack's cock in his mouth. Jack moaned louder, his fingers tightening in Aaron's hair as his tongue rubbed against him. 
Aaron slipped his hands around Jack's hips, running his lips up and down, sucking softly and slowly. Both of Jack's hands crept behind Aaron's neck, fingers curling into his choppy hair. 

Aaron kept going, stopping periodically, holding Jack's cock deep in his throat or flicking his tongue over the tip. Jack gasped, biting his lip to stay quiet, his hips arching up against Aaron. He yanked on Aaron's hair, managing a strangled "Wait".

"What, what'd I do wrong?"
Aaron sat up, terrified that the awkwardness had finally kicked in and Jack couldn't do it.

"Move over this way...I don't wanna be selfish." Jack snickered, motioning to Aaron. 
Before he could move, Jack sat up and unzipped Aaron's jacket, nuzzling the side of his neck while he did. He nipped at Aaron's collarbone, unzipping his pants and sliding his hand under his briefs. Aaron moved next to Jack and continued sucking him, motivated both by Jack's hand in his pants and the delicious noises he was making. Aaron, for once thankful that Jack masturbated more than anyone he'd ever known, sucked Jack deeper and faster, now trying to quiet his own moaning thanks to Jack's experienced fingers. 

Aaron forced his throat open, suppressed his gag reflex and sucked faster, squeezing Jack's balls with one hand and lightly clawing his chest with the other. Jack was gasping louder, his hips pushing against Aaron's face when he moaned out all as one word "Fuck, I'm gonna come". 

Aaron shuddered against him, hard almost to the point of pain and went faster, rubbing his tongue against Jack's cock, squeezing his balls harder. He felt his legs shaking, Jack's hand moving working him fantastically. Jack's nails bit into the back of his neck as he gasped, bucking against Aaron's mouth, coming into his throat. He jacked Aaron off harder, his entire body shaking against him. Aaron slipped his mouth around the entirety of Jack's cock and felt himself about to go. 

Jack stopped for a second, wet his fingers and started doing something incredible with the tip of Aaron's cock for about twenty seconds before Aaron felt his entire body tighten, and then release as he came against Jack's hand. Aaron's moans were muffled by Jack's cock, but he was positive the downstairs neighbors would be confused as hell as to what was going on in the supposedly empty apartment above. Jack's hand fell away slowly as Aaron licked the remnants of come off of his dick and his lips. He turned around and crawled against Jack, laying his head against his chest. 

"I...can't believe that just happened." Jack gasped after a minute, his hands still twitching.

"What, that you finally got some or that I was the one that did it?" Aaron mumbled, the wonderful lethargy he felt after sex settling in. Jack breathed a quiet laugh, shrugged and finally managed out "Both. I'm not saying I regretted it though...hell, definitely not." 
Aaron smiled and kissed Jack's chest, their hands finding each other again. 

"I love you, J. I've always loved you, and this isn't going to change anything..." Aaron said softly, rubbing his thumb over Jack's.

"Yeah, other than my constant sexual frustration. Think of all the free time I'll have now without having to jack off, right?"&nbsp; They both burst out laughing, and Aaron realized that things wouldn't change. It comforted him, made him happier than anything had in what seemed like an incredibly long time. He grabbed Jack's trenchcoat and pulled it towards him, digging out the cigarette and lighter again and tossed one to Jack.

"Oh, this is just too much. All we're missing is the roses, candles and Barry White." Jack murmured around his cigarette, still sprawling on the floor.

"And, I don't know, an actual bed? Shit, at least a carpet or something. This floor's hard, man." 

Jack looked over at him, starting to smirk. Aaron grabbed the trencoat, lay back down next to him and pulled it over them like a blanket. "Y'know, there was a joke in there but I'm too lazy to get it."

"Amen to that." Jack chuckled, pulling Aaron close against him. They finished the cigarettes, laid together for a while before remembering they were still technically trespassing and finally got back up, pulled their shirts on and left. When they climbed the narrow three floors to their own apartment, Aaron was almost ecstatic to have Jack hold his hand. They reached their door and stopped, looking at each other for a minute. 

"So...?"
Jack shrugged, pulled Aaron close and kissed him softly. His glasses pressed against Aaron's face, their fingers still tight around each other&#8217;s. When he pulled away, Aaron was smiling and blushing like a schoolgirl. "I told you so,ï¿½ He said pushing the front door open.

"Told me so what?" Jack locked the door and tossed the keys onto the kitchen counter, already kicking his shoes off.

"I told you, it wouldn't change things. I'm always right. So there." Aaron stuck his tongue out at him and smiled like a jackass, tossing his jacket on the bed.









Jack&#8217;s alarm went off at 9 AM as always, buzzing irritation in his ear. He fumbled, knocked miscellaneous things off the side table in the process and finally succeeded in slapping it off.&nbsp; He groaned, buried his face deeper into the mess of pillows and sleeping bags that made up his couch-bed and pulled the covers tighter around him all the while wondering why he still bothered to set an alarm on his day off. 
As if in response to his wondering, he heard Aaron rustling in the chair next to him.
ï¿½Why did you even set that? You have the day off, dumbass.ï¿½ 
Jack groaned again and sat up, covers still wrapped around his head. Aaron set down his book, stared at him for a second before laughing.
Oblivious, Jack stared back before finally asking ï¿½What?ï¿½
Aaron shook his head, tossed a pack of cigarettes at him and sighed. ï¿½You look likeï¿½a drunk who wandered into a refugee camp. ï¿½&nbsp; Jack flipped him off on instinct, lighting a cigarette with his other hand. ï¿½Up yours, buddyï¿½. 
Aaron marked his page and set the book down, kicking his legs over the arm of the chair. ï¿½Seriously, though, why&#8217;d you set an alarm? Was there something we&#8217;re supposed to be doing today?ï¿½ 
Jack sat for a second, looking almost comatose while he went down the list in his head. Rent was paid, electricity was good and the kitchen was overstocked thanks to random early morning trips to the all night grocery store.&nbsp; He shrugged and dug around behind him for his glasses. ï¿½Nope. We&#8217;re good. ï¿½
Aaron raised an eyebrow, smirking. ï¿½So, you&#8217;re up at 9 AMï¿½.on your day offï¿½why exactly?ï¿½
Jack grunted and shrugged, butting the cigarette out in an empty can on the floor. He crawled off the couch, trailing the huge quilt behind him and wandered off down the hallway, thin blonde hair sticking up at every angle. Aaron snickered again, watching him go. ï¿½Nice look you&#8217;ve got there, man. The Beetlejuice hair is really working for you this morning.ï¿½ 
Aaron sighed and leaned back against the other arm of the chair, hoping it wouldn&#8217;t fall apart under him and ran a hand through his own hair and grimacing. ï¿½I need a shower, bad. My hair&#8217;s feeling all sorts of disgusting.ï¿½ 
ï¿½That&#8217;s because you&#8217;re Italian.ï¿½ Jack had sat back down on the couch and was leaning on Aaron&#8217;s legs. Aaron snorted and kicked at his shoulder lightly. ï¿½Yeah? Then what&#8217;s your excuse, Danish-boy?ï¿½ 
Jack shrugged again, the epitome of Not Caring. Aaron got up and started digging through a pile of semi-clean and recently washed clothes that hadn&#8217;t been put away yet. ï¿½Seriously, though. I&#8217;m gonna take a shower. Might as well do something productive if I&#8217;m already up this early.ï¿½
ï¿½I need a shower too. As you&#8217;ve already so kindly pointed out, I don&#8217;t have and excuse to be grimy.ï¿½ Jack sneered jokingly, popping his knuckles. 
ï¿½So? I won&#8217;t be in there long. You know how it is here, we traded water pressure for unending hot water. There&#8217;s gotta be an upside somewhere, right?ï¿½
Jack stared blankly at Aaron, giving him the ï¿½You&#8217;re an idiotï¿½ look. 
ï¿½What? What&#8217;d I say?ï¿½ Aaron finally snapped after a minute.
Jack&#8217;s mouth curled up into a wry smile as he leaned over the arm of the couch.
ï¿½I need a shower. You need a shower.ï¿½
Aaron&#8217;s mouth did a similar thing, one dark eyebrow raising in unison. ï¿½Ah, I see what you&#8217;re getting at. Kill two birds with one stone, right?ï¿½
Jack sat up off the couch and stretched. ï¿½Yeah, somethin&#8217; like that.ï¿½

Jack was already stripped down before he got to the bedroom, which was nothing new to Aaron or anyone else that knew him. Jack was happiest in as little clothing as possible. When he had company over, he settled for shorts and t-shirts, occasionally shirtless but if it was just him and Aaron, he was almost always in his boxers.&nbsp; Aaron was the complete opposite, as he realized now sitting on the toilet seat in jeans, two shirts and even shoes. Aaron, Jack had once commented, seemed to have a serious emotional attachment to his shoes bordering on the unnerving.
ï¿½Uhï¿½you are going to get naked, right? We don&#8217;t have a dryer, and I know those are your favorite pantsï¿½ï¿½ Jack cajoled him, sitting on the edge of the tub naked. Aaron breathed a quiet laugh, inexplicably nervous and feeling like an idiot. They&#8217;d seen each other naked enough times to be almost unphased by it, and after what&#8217;d happened in the old apartment a few nights ago he knew embarrassment at this point was more or less moot. He sighed and finally, almost grudgingly stripped down, all the while aware of Jack&#8217;s eyes on him. 
Jack tested the water, almost fell in twice, and finally got it hot enough for both of their taste. Aaron shut the door halfway, thankful that Jack had at least let him keep the garish light off and only a little reluctantly followed suit. 
Once in the shower, he felt much more comfortable though, especially with Jack&#8217;s looming presence next to him. He leaned back into the almost scalding spray and shivered, letting the water slick back his hair. Jack slid against him and curled his arms around Aaron&#8217;s shoulders, pulling him against him. Aaron smiled and let him, laying his head against Jack&#8217;s chest.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Jack dropped an arm, retrieved shampoo, dumped a liberal amount onto Aaron&#8217;s head and started working it into his thick black hair. Aaron shivered again as Jack&#8217;s nails brushed the back of his neck, playing with his hair, setting him into an almost drool-inducing comfort. Jack gently pushed his head forward and ruffled his hair under the weak spray of water, his body pressed tightly against Aaron&#8217;s.&nbsp; Aaron felt something in him shudder in excitement and he reached around to pull Jack closer to him. They stayed like that for a while, thin spray of water drizzling down onto them, steam pressing against the skin like hands. Eventually Aaron turned around and pulled Aaron&#8217;s face down to meet his, brushing their lips together. 
ï¿½I love you, Jï¿½ he whispered against Jack&#8217;s lips, his arms locked around Jack&#8217;s neck. Jack kissed him back, stubble brushing over Aaron&#8217;s cheek as he did. After a few seconds they let go and went back to actually showering, Aaron washing Jack&#8217;s hair this time. He dug out Jack&#8217;s sponge and washed him off, subconsciously always keeping himself as close as possible to him, loving the sensation of skin against skin. Aaron snickered when Jack twitched against him as his hands went lower and lower, running his fingertips over Jack&#8217;s hips while he washed him.&nbsp; He rinsed the sponge and let Jack was him off, feeling only the tiniest bit silly for letting another man bathe him. 
After what seemed like half an hour, the water finally started to cool off and they were forced to get out and find suitably clean towels.&nbsp; Jack barely even dried himself off before wandering into the bedroom and flopping onto the bed. Aaron was digging through the closet almost immediately when he got back in before Jack sighed. ï¿½Can&#8217;t you justï¿½not flip shit about being naked for once?ï¿½
Aaron faltered and shut the door, unaware that he&#8217;d pulled the towel tighter around himself. Jack was staring up at him almost desperately, which would&#8217;ve been a lot less amusing if he hadn&#8217;t been ass naked.&nbsp; Aaron finally caved and sat down on the bed next to him, giving the closet one last longing stare. 
ï¿½Okay, fine. You win this time. This does feel nice.ï¿½
Jack pulled him tighter, burrowing his chin against Aaron&#8217;s neck and repeated for the second time ï¿½This feels wonderfulï¿½. One hand slid down to Aaron&#8217;s hips and curled around them, at the same time both possessive and tender. Aaron bit his lip against a moan and slipped his fingers into Jack&#8217;s other hand, breathing out a shaky sigh. ï¿½What&#8217;s wrong? What, is this awkward?ï¿½
Aaron laughed, almost embarrassed and shook his head against the pillow. ï¿½What? Fuck no, no it&#8217;s not awkward it&#8217;sï¿½its great.ï¿½ He could almost see Jack&#8217;s eyebrows furrowing as he asked ï¿½Then what?ï¿½
Aaron felt his face flush and was suddenly grateful that Jack was behind him as he half-mumbled out ï¿½You&#8217;re just really turning me on.ï¿½
Jack buried his face in Aaron&#8217;s shoulder and laughed, shaking the entire bed. ï¿½Ohhh. Okay. So?ï¿½
Aaron breathed a sigh of relief and felt himself relax against Jack. 
ï¿½So...you&#8217;re really turning me on. ï¿½ 
Jack slid the hand on Aaron&#8217;s hip lower and squeezed him lightly. Aaron sucked in a breath, biting his bottom lip again. Jack rumbled an evil chuckle behind him and did it again, his tongue flicking out across Aaron&#8217;s neck.
ï¿½Oh, you&#8217;re such an asshole.ï¿½ Aaron gasped, his entire body prickling at the combined sensations. 
Jack slid his fingers over Aaron&#8217;s dick, biting down on his neck and Aaron actually cried out in spite of his desperate self control. He felt Jack slipping his arm out from underneath him and fingers crawling into his hair, pulling at it. Aaron moaned again, pushing himself against Jack and feeling Jack&#8217;s cock doing the same. 
ï¿½Ha, I&#8217;m not the only one turned on, dickheadï¿½ He managed to gasp as Jack squeezed him again. Jack rubbed himself against Aaron&#8217;s backside, breath catching in his throat as he did, and pulled hard on Aaron&#8217;s hair again. Aaron rolled over abruptly and slid on top of Jack, their erections briefly touching. Jack stared up at him, gray eyes blazing, a perverted little grin hiding at the corners of his mouth. He grabbed Aaron&#8217;s hair and pulled him down, forcing his tongue into his mouth. Aaron&#8217;s tongue slid into his mouth, his teeth scraping at Jack&#8217;s lips, his hips moving involuntarily against Jack&#8217;s. 
Jack realized he was nearly painfully hard, his dick rubbing against Aaron&#8217;s ass, Aaron&#8217;s weight pressing into his chest.&nbsp; Aaron broke the kiss first, gasping softly and whispered almost desperately in Jack&#8217;s ear ï¿½Fuck meï¿½.&nbsp; 
With no hesitation, Jack shoved Aaron off of him and climbed on top of him, grabbing a handful of his shaggy black hair and pulling hard. Aaron squirmed beneath him, his chest heaving. Jack leaned in and licked a wet trail down Aaron&#8217;s chest, biting down on one of his nipples. Aaron made a weird growling noise in the back of his throat and shook, wrapping his arms around Jack and clutching him tightly. 
ï¿½Are you sure?ï¿½ Jack mumbled in his ear, half serious and half taunting. Aaron grabbed Jack&#8217;s ass hard, nails biting in to his skin. ï¿½If you don&#8217;t, I&#8217;m gonna kick your fucking ass.ï¿½ Jack started to laugh but was shut up by Aaron pushing him over and burying his head between Jack&#8217;s legs. Jack&#8217;s entire body felt warm, Aaron&#8217;s wet mouth teasing the tip of his cock, his tongue licking wet swaths down the entire length.&nbsp; After a few agonizingly slow minutes, Aaron pulled away and stared up at Jack with an almost starved look in his eyes. 
Jack lifted Aaron&#8217;s legs up, glanced at him with one last second of apprehension and slowly pushed into him. Aaron moaned, nails clutching at the bed sheets.&nbsp; He held himself for a second, the ensuing pleasure rushing to his head, the first time he&#8217;d actually fucked anyone in years. He brushed Aaron&#8217;s hair out of his eyes with one hand and moved a bit, slowly. Beneath him, Aaron was breathing heavy, his eyelids fluttering. ï¿½J, it&#8217;s okay. Please, for fuck&#8217;s sake, you&#8217;re not going to hurt me, love.ï¿½ 
Jack nodded and said ï¿½Okayï¿½ more to himself than anything and started in an out, Aaron&#8217;s tightness seemingly to pull at him. He pushed Aaron&#8217;s knees up and rested his shoulders against them, fucking him harder now that he wasn&#8217;t worried about hurting him, and watched Aaron&#8217;s reaction change from joy to complete ecstasy. He moved faster now, hips grinding against Aaron&#8217;s ass, nails biting into Aaron&#8217;s willing skin, his own eyes starting to fall shut in pleasure. 
He slowed down to an almost complete stop, wanting to keep it going as long as possible and watched Aaron&#8217;s chest heave, his fingers twitching. He moved agonizingly slow, leaning in to kiss Aaron again. Aaron started to say something and he started back up, fucking him deeper now and sliding his hands up to choke Aaron while he did. Aaron&#8217;s chest seemed to vibrate as he half-gasped and moaned at the same time, his teeth clenching, nails scraping against Jack&#8217;s back. He gasped encouragement, urging Jack to choke him harder, screw him deeper, and above all else keep going. 
Jack let go of Aaron&#8217;s throat and wrapped his arms around him, pulling him up against him. His fingers buried into Aaron&#8217;s hair while he pumped in and out, Aaron nearly sobbing in enjoyment. Jack felt himself getting close and slid a hand between them to rub the very tip of Aaron&#8217;s cock. Aaron&#8217;s body arched against him and he involuntarily bit down on Jack&#8217;s neck, his entire body convulsing against Jack&#8217;s. Jack shoved him back against the bed and fucked him almost viciously for another minute, his entire body tightening up. Aaron was still gasping, his hands weakly still pulling at Jack as he nodded, wanting him to come inside of him. 
Jack pushed in deep as he could and held there for a second before moving again and again before he felt himself let go deep inside of Aaron. He was shaking when he pulled himself out, sucking in heavy breaths of air as he laid down next to Aaron, who was looking half-comatose from enjoyment.&nbsp; Jack flopped back against the bed, breathing heavy. Aaron curled against him, laying his head against his chest.
ï¿½Jï¿½that was fucking fantastic. Fuck man, I&#8217;m still shakingï¿½ Aaron managed to gasp out, sliding a hand around Jack&#8217;s waist.&nbsp; Jack nodded, unaware that a huge smile had spread across his face. ï¿½Yeah, yeah it wasï¿½we totally have to do this again sometimeï¿½. 
ï¿½How&#8217;s tomorrow sound?ï¿½ Aaron murmured, entirely serious. Jack shook his head and sighed contentedly, pulling Aaron tight against him as he drifted back to sleep. Aaron yawned and shifted his head so he could hear Jack&#8217;s heart beating and did the same.
