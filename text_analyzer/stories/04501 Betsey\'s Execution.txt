BETSEY�S Execution - PART ONE

The Euthanasia and Right to Die Act of 2105, passed by our Legislature a few months ago, permits terminally-ill persons to petition the courts for permission to take their own lives by certain prescribed methods. One prescribed method, due to my lobbying efforts, is of course our electric chair. All the law requires is that two physicians must certify that the person is terminally-ill, and one psychiatrist must certify that the person is competent to petition the courts for permission to die. The person must be an adult and the petition must be a free and voluntary act. The person can also change her mind at anytime, and stop the execution process.

&#9;Betsey was an electrical engineer afflicted with a terminally-ill condition that privacy laws prohibit me from disclosing. We met while both lobbying in support of the Act on the Hill. She was in the early stages of her disease and said electrical euthanization appealed to her. �When done right, electricity will make a person go out like a light�, she intimated to me one night after a long day of lobbying. �I know honey�, I said. � I�ve seen it�. We laughed. I then relayed to her my experiences with Gina, Laura and the others. �Oh my� she said, �what you don�t read in the papers�. She giggled. A possible victim, I thought.

&#9;Betsey filed her petition the same day the Act passed and was signed into law by the Governor. Her method of choice: electrocution in Pacifica�s electric chair. Upon news of this, she immediately drew the attention of the media with her long shiny auburn hair, soft brown eyes and taut figure. She also incurred the wrath of anti-death penalty groups who vowed to oppose her every step of the way. Journalists seemed drawn to her. �How could such a stunningly beautiful, photogenic woman, volunteer for such a horrible fate?�, was the question asked over and over. Betsey always responded, �You will be torturing me to life, if you block my electrocution.� Her domestic partner Jodie {last name deleted} was her attorney and advocated her cause so brilliantly that even the judge who issued the order, himself an avid death penalty opponent, stated from the bench, �If this is what you want, I cannot deny your petition. The law is clear.� Anti-death penalty groups were stunned by the ruling, outraged at the judge and so focused on impeaching him, that they missed the deadline to appeal the judge�s ruling. Betsey was elated and immediately applied to the Governor for the earliest possible �appointment�. Her lawyer Jodie told me that Betsey�s mother died from the same condition, and Betsey remembered how her mom looked when she died. She was determined not to go through the same hell. �The chair isn�t exactly paradise counselor� I said. �No, but it�s quicker�, Jodie retorted.

&#9;In mid-August, Betsey received what she told the press was, �the happiest news in my life after being diagnosed six months before.� A notice arrived at her home from the State of Pacifica Department of Corrections, signed by me, which succinctly stated:



By decree duly entered by the Sinola County Court and the Governor of this State, you are to report no later than 0830 hrs on September 1, 2105, to the Women�s Correctional Institute at Sing Sing for euthanization in accordance with State law and your wishes. You are to be electrocuted on September 3, 2105 at 0830 hrs. You have the right to change your mind and decide not to proceed with this process at anytime.



&#9;In my office at the prison, I watched Betsey�s outdoor press conference, just outside the prison gates, where she was heckled by her opponents. She handled it with her usual elan. She wore a navy blue chiffon dress which simply looked beautiful on her. Her hem fluttered in the breeze revealing a tiny bit of lace and nylon underneath. She thanked Jodie and all who supported her. She was asked what she was going to wear to her execution. She responded that that was up to the prison authorities. I smiled. Absolutely nothing, I thought.








BETSEY�S Execution - PART TWO

&#9;Betsey arrived at the Warden�s house, at 1630 hrs on August 31, 2105, sixteen hours earlier to avoid running the gauntlet of press and protestors. Her lawyer Jodie, who ran interference for her, arrived a short while after. I had previously explained to Betsey that she would enter the prison by a secret underground passageway �when your time has come�. So while the press, protestors and others gathered outside the prison�s main entrance to make noise and accomplish nothing, the three of us wined, dined, romanced and enjoyed each other. Betsey did not have to go through the usual  process of intake, de-robing, the Reduction Chamber, etc. (Although, she would have looked so gorgeous and vulnerable laying nude on the Reducing Table and I would have loved to reduce her). 

&#9;Betsey was being held in �special voluntary custody� at the Warden�s (i.e., my) house. However, at 0730 hrs the next morning, the Execution Protocol would commence. In two nights she would be sleeping in the death-house. And the day following would be her last. This of course, unless she changed her mind. We�ll have a lot of fun in the meantime, I thought as we fell asleep. She smelled great.

&#9;The next morning, September 1, 2105, at 0730 hrs, the process began. After breakfast, Betsey, Jodie and I entered the prison and proceeded to the death-house. There we were met by Senior Corrections Officer Debra {last name deleted}. At that time, in Debra�s office, next to the death chambers, we reviewed the specifications of each of our four electric chairs. Betsey selected Chair No. 1 saying to Debra, �The Warden tells me Gina went wild in this one�. I shrugged to Debra and who smiled saying, �No coaching, Warden!� Turning back to the executee, Debra said, �Is this the chair you want, Betsey?� Debra asked. �Yes�, Betsey replied sweetly. 

&nbsp;

&#9;When the discussion turned to the subject of electrodes, Jodie and I left Betsey and her executioner alone for a few minutes in private. In parting, I told Debra, �Gina her�. �What�s that?� Betsey asked a quizzical expression on her face. �You�ll find out when the time comes, if you go through with it.� Betsey smiled. You�ve gotta do it, I thought.

&#9;In outside the room, Jodie confided to me that handling Betsey�s case cause her much conflict. She loved Betsey and was opposed to the death penalty, but felt her lover did not deserve to suffer. She said never imagined when she was in law school that she would have a case such as this with such consequences. Betsey and she had been partners since college and last year planned to marry until the bad news arrived. Jodie confided that she never thought that she would play such a role in ending Betsey�s life. I told Jodie that all she did was help her partner get the choice to die; the rest was up to Betsey. Jodie�s emotions got the best of her; she began to cry. We hugged.

&#9;Emerging from Debra�s office with a radiant smile, Betsey announced that she had opted for the golden electrodes. 
�Are you sure?�, I asked. 
�Yes, Warden� Betsey replied. �Gold is the best conductor of electricity.� 
�You might enjoy the chrome set better.� I replied, concerned because the vaginal electrode from only the chrome set vibrated, while its the gold set counterpart did not. Damn it, we won�t be able to Gina her, I thought. 
�Don�t worry Warden� Debra interrupted, �I have plenty of time to make the necessary modifications to our equipment.� Debra winked. 
�What are you talking about?� Betsey asked. 
�You�ll find out when the time comes, brave girl� I said, laughing with Debra. 
�No coaching Warden� Debra intoned. Betsey smirked. She�s gotta go through with it, I thought.

&#9;While Debra made her modifications to the gold vaginal electrode, Betsey, Jodie and I returned to the Warden�s house. Again as the protestors and press gathered outside, we did everything possible to make Betsey enjoy the little time she was going to have left. I my private basement dungeon, all the focus was on Betsey in preparing her for her ultimate sub experience. I watched Jodie undress Betsey. It was quite a sight. 

&#9;�My slip is showing�, Betsey said as she reached in her pocketbook producing some static guard. Standing up, she raised the front hem of her navy blue chiffon dress and sprayed her slip. �This usually doesn�t happen to me� Betsey confided. �There�s more behind you� Jodie lied, as she raised the back and side hems of Betsey�s dress, spraying. Betsey looked down over her shoulder sheepishly. She�s already full of electricity, I thought. After her press conference, I begged her to wear that dress for this occasion and to my pleasure she obliged. Jodie then proceed to unzip the back of Betsey�s dress. I became moist and my nipples erect as Betsey, looking down at Jodie, raised her arms overhead as Jodie raised and then lifted the dress up and away. Betsey was a beautiful sight in her lacy blue camisole and half-slip. What a shame to electrocute this! I thought. Her slip a had a lacy slit from the hem all the way to the waistband. Classy yet very sexy, I thought, as my heart raced. Jodie removed Betsey�s camisole and then stood back to admire her partner now clad in her bra and half-slip. I was soaked in sweat. Betsey then began to disrobe Jodie and here is how they looked:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
Their eyes meet as Jodie ran her fingers along the waistband of Betsey�s half-slip, making Betsey giggle and her tummy twitch. I�ll be seeing that tummy twitch when her time comes, I thought. And she won�t be giggling either! These two women knew how to pleasure one another. Jodie then worked her way behind Betsey who, arms up-raised and cooing, craned her neck to one side and closed her eyes. Jodie then slid her hand under Betsey�s waistband eliciting a tense smile followed suddenly by gasp. Betsey�s mouth was agape, her eyes wide-open and filled with lesbian passion. Jodie began to nibble at her victim�s neck while I worked the tummy. Betsey squealed and squirmed. She loved it. I gently bit into her waistband and pulled it down over her buttocks, causing her slip to fall to the floor in a gentle swoosh, revealing her sheer beauty as well as her diamond-pierced navel. Naughty, yet discreet, I thought as she daintily stepped over her half-slip that had puddled at her feet.

&#9;Standing there in her lycra navy blue bra and low-rise, hi-cut briefs, garters, lacy thigh-highs and heels, Betsey began to cover up. Pulling down her victim�s arms, Jodie said, �Betsey come on, don�t be embarrassed, the Warden is not a stranger�. I pointed to the bed, and both walked over holding hands. As I was undressing, Jodie pushed Betsey by the tummy down on the bed. Sitting at the edge of the bed, Jodie removed Betsey�s bra, and I immediately began to feel envious and jealous of Betsey at how blessed she was. And in two days she�ll be gone, I thought as I joined in, removing Betsey�s undies so that she was bare like the rest of us. Only her nylons and heels remained. �Betsey honey, I�m glad you didn�t do anything foolish like go out and get a wax job or anything like that. Because we have something special in store for you tomorrow night, your last night.� I said. �What�s that?� she asked. I didn�t respond. You�ll see, I thought as a hooked my middle finger and slid it through her pubis and inside her. She closed her eyes and my finger immediately became wet. �Cuff her!� I instructed Jodie who immediately complied. �Sit her up!� I said. Again Jodie complied. I smiled, as did Betsey, when I found her spot. As she began to release, her hands were cuffed behind her back, she was sitting up and her hair to one side over her right shoulder, as I tried to pick her up with my hooked finger.  Jodie pulled her hair back just right, biting her neck and shoulder. Betsey then completely lost control, having multiple orgasms before finally collapsing onto the bed. I then un-cuffed her out of mercy. �You are such a beautiful woman, Betsey,� I said. She smiled back as Jodie caressed her.

&#9;After re-hydrating ourselves, I sat on the bed behind Betsey and pulled her down, holding her arms in a full-Nelson. Jodie then spread our victim�s nyloned thighs and went to work, kissing, tasting, etc., etc., etc. Betsey screamed, squirmed, squealed and laughed. She went into overdrive when I released her from the Nelson and proceeded to rub her labium first side-to-side and then in a circular motion; slow then fast, then slow then very fast, etc., etc., etc. All this time she kept her arms over her head. �You are such a good sub� I whispered in her ear before licking her lobe. �That tickles!� she giggled. �She�s very ticklish� Jodie informed me. I smiled devilishly and then proceeded upstairs to fix some dinner in the kitchen.

&#9;When I returned twenty minutes later, Betsey was snuggled next to Jodie and fast asleep. Jodie was awake. �Let her rest� I whispered. �She�ll get more later� I said. �Let�s eat� I said. �I just did� Jodie retorted. Betsey smiled and giggled, eyes still closed. We ate and let the beauty sleep.

&#9;When we returned about an hour later, we decide to play some mind games with our victim. We pushed the clocks and calendar twenty-two hours ahead. I awoke Betsey by tickling her nyloned feet, electing a squirm and giggle. 
�Come on Betsey wake up!� I said, �We have to move. We are behind schedule.� 
�What?� she said. 
�You slept all last night and all day today.� I said. �It�s time to move you to the death house. Let�s go.� 
She was confused. Jodie and I were all dressed. 
�Give me a few minutes� she said. 
�Okay, five minutes� I said officially. 
�Can I help her Warden?� Jodie asked. 
�You may, counselor.� I said leaving them.

&#9;�Where is my jumpsuit� Betsey asked Jodie. �I�ll get it for you, honey� Jodie responded. When Jodie returned, she said she couldn�t find it but found something else. Producing a chrome vibrator, Jodie pushed Betsey by the shoulders back onto the bed. I then returned and asked what was going on. They mentioned the missing jumpsuit and I responded by saying �Don�t worry we have until tomorrow to find it�. Betsey, disoriented as to date and time, was totally confused. 
�You mean my appointment has been re-scheduled?� Jodie then told her what we did with the date and time. 
�You assholes!� she replied. 
�Shut up and lay down!� Jodie said turning on the vibrator. The next thing I heard was Betsey squealing to the sound of the vibrator buzzing up against her pierced navel and then her lower tummy. Multiple orgasms again! I thought. Do these two know how to make each other happy!

&#9;After a few minutes, Jodie turned off the vibrator, and at my request, applied some KY to it and Betsey. 
�You obviously don�t need it now doll� I said. �but you�ll need it, as a conductor, the morning after next. So let�s let apply a pre-execution coat to your insides now.� 
�I agree, Warden� Betsey replied.
�I don�t care of you agree,� I retorted, �Protocol is protocol!� 
Turning on the vibrator again, Jodie proceeded around and around and around Betsey�s labium, repeatedly circling her prize. Her arms again overhead, Betsey�s beautiful face bore more and more tension with each buzzing revolution. She opened her mouth and let out an occasional sigh or moan as she ejaculated over and over and over again. Jodie was laughing. �You�re enjoying this, aren�t you love?� Jodie asked. 
Betsey sighed and closed her eyes in response. 

&#9;Then as Jodie again reached the top of her labium, Betsey partially sat up, looked down at her partner, lowered one of her arms, and with her left hand, gently pressed down on the vibrator which slid in so naturally. At this moment, Betsey, head quivering, eyes glazed over, at once laid back down, closed her eyes, inhaled deeply and arched her back. She began raking, then twisting, first her left nipple, then her right nipple, with her right hand, while rubbing her labium with the other. Jodie again began kissing and tasting her victim. It was pure lesbian passion. I just sat there, watched and took it all in, not wanting to disturb a thing. It was so perfect. I just wish I had videotaped this since mere words cannot do justice. When she was done, Jodie removed the vibrator very slowly, while increasing its speed as she reached one of Betsey�s special spots. Betsey again arched her back, etc., and lost control. Do these women know each other or what, I thought. Once out, Betsey now sitting up straight, ran her arms and hands through her long long hair and let out a big sigh, again collapsing on the bed in total exhaustion. She looked beautiful. Jodie then asked for silence as she placed her ear near Betsey�s prize. �It�s still growling!� she said. I laughed as did Betsey, lazily. As she and Jodie cuddled, they invited me to join in, which I did graciously. �Rest up, Betsey� I said there is more fun tomorrow, you last full day.� I hope. She moaned in acquiescence, nuzzling next to me.
�Are you nervous about being electrocuted?� I asked.
�Nope. I think Jodie is more nervous about it than I am.�
We both looked at Jodie, who just stared at the ceiling, shook her head and closed her eyes in disbelief. It was 0100 hrs.

BETSEY�S Execution - part THREE

&#9;I awoke Betsey at 0700 hrs on September 2, 2105, her last full day. I hope. She was in a deep sleep from the frolicking of the previous night. I licked her ear lobe which tickled her awake. 
�Wake up doll. Rise and shine.� I said.
�Mmmmhmmmm�, she said.
Laying behind her, Jodie embraced her partner whispering, �Come on dear, get up.� Betsey complied.
Sitting up, Betsey ran her arms through her hair again. I couldn�t resist - I began manipulating her nipples which brought a sleepy laugh from her. �I wish we had met sooner honey� I said. �There�s still time.� Betsey replied. I then left Jodie and Betsey alone while I prepared breakfast.

&#9;Over breakfast, Betsey announced that she would discuss today with Debra, the possible placement of the optional electrodes for her execution. The mandatory electrodes for Betsey�s execution were as follows: 2 pasty-electrodes on the fore-head, 1 black-pad electrode at the base of the neck, 1 black-pad electrode at the base of spine, 1 gold-plug vaginal electrode (with speculum), 1 gold-plug anal electrode and 1 gold-bar electrode at each ankle). Betsey announced that she decided that, for her electrocution, she also wanted optional electrodes placed as follows: 

&#9;- 2 pasty-electrodes on each breast astride each nipple, 
&#9;- 5 black-pad electrodes to the abdomen (with 1 over the navel); 
&#9;- 4 black-pad electrodes to the lower back; 
&#9;- 2 black-pad electrodes at each hip; 
&#9;- 2 pasty electrodes to each buttock;
&#9;- 2 pasty electrodes to the upper inside of each thigh;
&#9;- 1 blue-band electrode around each thigh, calf and bicep; and,
&#9;- the high-heels electrodes - 1 per foot.

�You�re taking no chances Betsey� I said.
�Nope� she said. �I want it over quick.�
�Sounds like you are going for a record: the most electrodes.




&nbsp;
Debra who had joined us for breakfast stated, �There is no such thing as overkill in an execution�. Gallows humor.
Debra also suggested Betsey wear the brine-soaked sponge socks on her feet since she opted for the heels. �It will also work well with the ankle electrodes.� She advised.
�Cut off the ends so I can see her toes curl� I said. Again, gallows humor.
�Gee thanks, Warden,� Betsey replied.
Jodie remained silent throughout and picked at her food.

&#9;Betsey then got up from the table and said she need to get dressed. 
�What?� I said.
�Get dressed, Warden. I have to .   .   .   .�
�I don�t think so� I said opening her red silk robe and showing Debra her beauty.
�Debra?�
�Yes, Warden�
�Did you bring the sybian?�
�Per your order.�
�Oh my� Betsey replied.
�You�re familiar with it, Betsey?�
She smiled back.
Jodie�s face light up.
�Let�s take Betsey for one last ride.�
Betsey was again cuffed and lead downstairs to the dungeon.

&#9;Betsey selected the flat-top attachment for her ride. When the sybian is activated, the attachment vibrates at various speeds and in various directions. The rider, who sits astride the black-leather sybian, literally has the ride of her life, regardless of the attachment used. The flat-top attachment is ribbed and also has a protrusion measuring about 1 inch in height which in Betsey�s case hit the spot, literally. Again, I watched while Jodie and Debra did all the work. Betsey donned her favorite pair of black lacy nylon thigh-highs. Debra ordered her to mount the device and she complied. Betsey then closed eyes as she made herself comfy. Her sunglasses and facial harness were put on. The harness included a mouth-piece and chin-strap which would be used in her electrocution. She was then roped up - Debra�s specialty. Her wrists were bound and her arms were raised overhead. After finishing roping-up Betsey�s ankles and thighs, Debra nodded to Jodie who activated the sybian at exactly 8:30 AM. This time tomorrow .   .   .   , I thought.

&#9;Immediately, Betsey�s eyebrows rose above her sunglasses. She�s enjoying this. Debra began fondling Betsey�s cleavage as her breasts bounced.
�Don�t do that twenty-fours from now Debra� I joked.
Debra laughed. I could hear Betsey manage a stifled laugh through her mouthpiece. Gallows humor. Jodie then increased the sybian�s speed and intensity. Betsey squirmed, twitched, tried to stand up on her knees, but due to Debra�s fine rope work, she could only move just a few inches. There was no relief from the intensity of what was happening to her. Her hair was flying all around her head. She was bathed in perspiration. She again smelled great. Debra then unbound Betsey�s ankles and thighs and allowed her to stand and catch her breath. 

&#9;Jodie then slid the sybian out from under Betsey and the flat-top was replaced by my choice of attachment: the G-Max. This attachment has a protrusion about 2 inches in height with a rotating vibrating ball on the end. The device was then slid back under Betsey who again willingly straddled it. As she squirmed for comfort, Debra rebound her feet and ankles, but lowered her arms down in front of Betsey. Jodie re-activated the device with the usual reaction. Betsey seemed to be experiencing an earthquake as she trembled violently. As Debra and I observed, we brainstormed. We then came upon an idea. We whispered our idea to Jodie who looked at Betsey and nodded enthusiastically. �She�ll love it� she said.

&nbsp;

&#9;As Betsey rode, Debra and I retrieved some electrical equipment from a corner in the basement. Before inquiring of Betsey, we decided she should have some respite. While the four of us talked about Betsey�s big day tomorrow and what would happen to her, she gave no indication of her intentions. She indicated that the facial harness fit perfectly. She remained bound and astride the sybian and talked about her previous experience with electro-stimulation. Jodie intimated that she brought along Betsey�s favorite electrode: nipple suction cup electrodes. 
�Can these be used tomorrow at my execution?� Betsey inquired.
�No� I replied. �Only official state equipment may be used for liability reasons. That�s Protocol, Betsey.�
Betsey and Jodie appeared downcast until I said that nothing prevented us from using their toy today.

&#9;Debra then proceeded to raise up Betsey�s arms one last time. I filled the clear plastic suction cups with KY, which doubles as a great conductor and adhesive and applied some jelly to her nipples, which instantly grew as hard as pencil erasers. I then wired up and secured the suction cups to each nipple with wing-nuts.
�Let�s go without the harness this time, okay Betsey?�
�Sure� she said.
Jodie then activated the sybian one last time and Betsey again closed her eyes as she entered into her gyrations. This time we could hear her enjoy her last sybian ride. I hope. As Betsey ejaculated, Debra sensing the right moment turned on the current which caused Betsey to stiffen and strain again the ropes as she tried to fold over. She was screaming so loud, that Debra lowered the voltage. At the lower voltage, Betsey gave off a buzzing-gurgling sound. Her sweat dripped onto the sybian. I then told Jodie and Betsey to turn everything off which they did. Drenched, Betsey said, �That was awesome.� I hope we encouraged you for tomorrow, I thought. 

&#9;After lunch, we put Betsey to bed. She slept until 1800 hrs while Jodie, Debra and I plotted one more surprise. Jodie cooked Betsey her favorite: baked scrod and scallops with bread crumbs and lemon and salad. I sincerely hoped that this would be Betsey�s last meal. I took in Betsey�s beauty while there was still time. After dinner, Betsey asked for her orange jumpsuit. Jodie, Debra and I looked at each other and laughed.
�What�s the joke, I have to report to the death-house by 8:30 PM don�t I?� 
�Yes Betsey, but you will not arrive in a prison jumpsuit.� I said. 
�I have to walk through the passageway naked!?� she asked incredulously. 
�Nope� I said. �Orange is not your best color. And black latex looks better on you anyway.�
Jodie and Debra nodded in unison.
�I don�t understand� she said.
�Come with us.� I said.

&#9;As Betsey proceeded with us downstairs to the passageway between the Warden�s house and the death-house, I told her, �We have one more fetish of yours to satisfy, don�t we?�.
�I think I know what you have in mind� she giggled in reply. 
�Oh?� I said.
As we rounded the corner, she discovered how right she was.
�Strip!� I ordered.
�Nope� she smiled back.
Playing hard to get? Or is she getting cold feet?
I opened Betsey�s robe again as Debra stealthily approached from behind her with a vacuum hose. Betsey was de-robed in one quick slurp. Again she covered up sheepishly.
�Remove the heels and nylons too!�
�Yes Warden, ma�am.�
Just as I thought, playing hard to get. 
Debra vacuumed the nylons off the floor and then said �You�ll get everything back once you are in the death-house� as she turned the vacuum off.
Jodie watched from the background.
�Get in, Betsey!� Debra ordered.
Betsey rested her buttocks on the edge of the gurney and the frame of the black vac-bed. She looked up at us.
�Polish me up, nice and shiny� she said as she climbed in, winking.
�We promise�, I said.
As she adjusted the breathing tube, Debra attached the hose to the vac-bed.
As I put my ear to the tube and heard and felt the executee breathing, I nodded to Debra who turned on the vacuum cleaner. As the latex closed in and around her voluptuous figure, Betsey squirmed. Too bad she is laying on her back. Her ass must look awesome. I heard some object getting sucked first through the frame and then through the hose. �Sounds like one of her toe rings� Debra surmised with a devilish grin. I grinned back shaking my head. She loves this. When Betsey was fully sealed, the vacuum cleaner gave off a high pitched whine. Debra then sealed the frame valve, disconnected the hose and turned off the vacuum. All sealed in, Jodie, Debra and I proceeded to buff and polish Betsey to a lusty shine, giving special attention to certain areas. She giggled and squirmed against the latex as her nipples, tummy and other areas were buffed. Debra then departed for the death-house to receive the executee. Jodie went back upstairs to the Warden�s house to prepare for her role as official witness tomorrow morning. Alone with Betsey, I asked, can you breathe okay, honey?� Through the latex Betsey nodded and gave a thumbs up. She was then wheeled to her final destination by prison staff. Here�s how she looked:
 

. Here�s how she looked:
 








BETSEY�S Execution - part iV

Upon arrival at the death-house at 1900 hrs, the vac-bed was unsealed by Debra and Betsey emerged. 
�I think I lost one of my toe rings.� she said. 
�We figured as much.� I replied. 
�I was right� said Debra producing the toe ring, robe and nylons, along with Betsey�s heels. 
�You�ll get those back once you undergo pubis removal� I said.
�What?�
�Pubis removal.� said Debra. 
�And that�s my area of expertise, honey� said Sergeant Stella {last name deleted} stepping forward. Stella then explained the procedure to Betsey and its necessity. Betsey said that due to her professional background she understood the fire hazard risk.
�I�ve never done this before, but I�m game.� Betsey said eyes fluttering. �You�ll love it� I said winking.
�Just sit back, relax and do as I say, honey. Gina loved it; Laura found it kinky.� Pillows were placed under Betsey�s shoulders so she could watch what would be done to her next. 

&#9;Debra with Stella�s assistance coiled rope half-a-dozen times around Betsey�s gams, snug enough to hold Betsey in place but not too tight to cut off circulation. The coils were then looped and tied to the headboard, while her ankles were tied off and looped at the side posts. This caused  Betsey�s legs to move back and spread open, fully exposing her. �Have fun you two� Debra said in departing, �I�ll be back.� �We will� Stella said with her hand on Betsey washboard tummy. Betsey was giggling in anticipation. Stella then went to work. She turned the death-house canister vacuum on low suction, and handed the hose nozzle to Betsey whose hands remained free, for the time being. Stella then turned on the electric clippers and instructed Betsey to hold the nozzle wherever she was trimming to pick up clippings. Betsey obliged much to her delight. She kept looking down at Stella throughout the whole process, her glazed, sultry eyes full of lesbian passion. When she finished trimming, Stella took the nozzle from Betsey and gently pushed her down on the prison bed. Again Betsey obliged laying back, resting slightly elevated on the pillows so she could watch. Debra then reentered the room and finished roping up Betsey. Betsey�s wrists were bound, her arms were placed (comfortably this time) over her head, and looped and tied off, again at the headboard. �Having fun aren�t we?�, Debra whispered to Betsey. Betsey moaned in the affirmative.

&#9;Attaching a corner attachment to the nozzle, Stella proceeded to vacuum Betsey�s labium, clitoris and vulva causing her victim to squeal and squirm against her binds. By now Betsey�s voice was becoming hoarse from the exertion of the past few days.
�I�m so fatigued from all the orgasms I�ve had over these last few days.� she said. Is she hinting that she�s going to go through with it! I thought. Please, go through with it! Please! �Don�t worry� Debra said, �you�ll have at least one or two more before you�re done here�. Betsey smiled weakly and laughed. Stella continued her work. Bound Betsey just laid there and enjoyed herself. When Stella finished, Betsey was soaked in sweet. Her pubis was gone except for a tiny patch of fur which would be safely away from any electrodes.  But we had to make sure. Debra approached her. 
�Can we try something, Betsey?�
�What?�
�How well you conduct down there.�
�What?!�
�We want to see how safely you�ll conduct down there for tomorrow morning.�
�Okay, just don�t kill me!�
�That�s up to you, honey.�
�What are you going to use, Debra?�
�Pasty-electrodes on the upper insides of your thighs, for starters, then we�ll see, if it�s alright with you.�
Betsey nodded.
After she hooked up Betsey, Debra activated the TENS unit causing Betsey to lunge against the ropes and yelp. Lowering the voltage, Debra observed Betsey beam a smile at her. Debra then turned off the voltage.

�More?�
Betsey nodded a yes.
Debra then coated both a black plug electrode and Betsey�s labium, vulva and clitoris with KY. She slid in the plug with Betsey looking down, helpless. After hooking up the black plug, Debra again activated then TENS unit, lighting up Betsey who squirmed and struggled against the ropes. I applied a massager for a brief moment. Again Betsey ejaculated, squirming hooting and howling. After the power was turned off, she just laid there and smiled at us, all tied up. 
&nbsp;
&#9;
Betsey was completely exhausted when she lay down in her cell adjacent to Death Chamber No. 1. She fell asleep at 2200 hours.








BETSEY�S Execution - part V
At 0600 hrs, Betsey awoke in her death cell, was served her last meal, breakfast, and she ate all of it. She had her breakfast alone with Jodie and they talked about was going to happen. After a long hug, they departed at 0730 hrs. Betsey was smiling, Jodie, with a stiff upper lip was fighting back tears.
�Please don�t this Betsey. Take an injection instead. Don�t electrocute yourself.�
�Don�t worry, I�ll be free shortly.�
Betsey smiled. Jodie sobbed.
Betsey then asked me the execution was on schedule and I said yes. 
She then showered and afterward K.S., our prison beautician, put Betsey�s hair in a bun, and did her nails and make-up. It was 0815 hrs.
At 0820 hrs, the door to the Death Chamber No. 1 opened and Betsey entered gracefully. In her haste she at first sat in the chair on a belt and was forced to get up so that it could be moved. As she was being strapped into the chair Betsey said in her final statement that she was proceeding with her execution so that others may freely exercise their constitutional right to die in the future. Debra came forward and kissed Betsey on the left cheek. I stepped forward and tongued her left ear lobe one final time which made her squirm and smile. On the other side of the glass partition, the sole witness, Jodie sobbed softly. Stella and K.S. consoled her. As Debra attached the electrodes, Betsey had a look in her eyes in which she appeared to be excited about being electrocuted. Aside from squirming and faint sighs and squeals when the anal and vaginal electrodes were inserted and the speculum adjusted, she offered no resistance. The facial harness, mouthpiece and chin strap were secured. A switch was placed in her right hand. Debra would arm the chair, but her computer was programmed for euthanasia executions to deliver a fatal jolt of electricity only of the executee depressed the red �hot-switch� button. 

&#9;At  0821 hrs, Debra began arming the chair by computer. The minutes passed by slowly while Betsey sat in Chair No.1 perspiring. Debra completed the arming process at exactly 0830 hrs, when the window for Betsey�s execution officially opened. After clicking the lightning bolt icon on her monitor, Debra stated, �The chair is armed� in her usual cold and official tone of voice, over the low hum in the background. �The chair is all yours Betsey�, she said encouragingly. Would she do it? If so, would my surprise �Gina� her? A few seconds after 0830 hrs, we found out. As if in super slow motion, Betsey�s thumb slowly but deliberately, depressed the �hot-switch� and the first jolt of 2500 volts of electricity raced through her lovely body for 60 seconds. Her eyes slammed shut and her body strained against the straps holding her in Chair No. 1  as she instinctively struggled to escape. Yes! Yes! Yes! She did it! Go girl! Go! She took the jolt, and her nubile body twitched and convulsed as if she was about to jump out of the chair! For a moment I wondered if the leather straps would hold her. But of course they did. Her beautiful figure then slammed against the back of the electric chair. Her tummy tightened and twitched. Her breasts bounced as she struggled desperately in the chair. Is she having second thoughts? Too late now! I could see how hard Betsey�s nipples were getting from the electricity. Juicing her had made her nipples very erect. No, she�s having fun. 

&#9;Her soft brown eyes, now agony-filled, opened wide. Her pupils danced from side-to-side and then rolled back as the electricity took control of her body and mind. Some sizzling was noted, but the smell of burning flesh was absent. The usual puff of white steam was observed rising from her ankles and small sparks briefly appeared in the navel area. An arc was observed over the speculum and vaginal electrode. This notwithstanding, a post-execution examination revealed that all the electrodes had been adequately moistened with either KY or brine solution, and no skin had been burned during the electrocution process. Perspiration fizzed creating additional steam arising from Betsey�s body, creating a sweet scent in the chamber. I observed her toes curling downward. A slight frothing at the mouth was also noticed during the first jolt. Muffled howls and screams, a la Gina, were heard. Nice job Debra!

&#9;In the six minutes the Protocol allowed for this hot body to cool from 145&#176;
F before Dr. Tina {last name deleted} could safely conduct an examination, Betsey visibly struggled to breathe, her breasts rose and fell with each labored breath, but at that point she was very likely already brain dead. In any event, she was dying quicker than if she had let her disease run its course. 

&#9;At 0838 hrs, Betsey was administered a second 90 second jolt of electricity. She made a muffled, fuzzy, gurgling sound. Her death rattle, I thought. Again, the cycle stopped and Dr. Tina stepped forward, stethoscope in hand, to exam Betsey. Dr. Tina reported that Betsey�s heart was still beating, and that she was very much alive. 

&#9;At 0846 hrs, a third and final jolt of electricity, 30 seconds in duration, was passed through Betsey. Minor frothing in the mouth and sizzling again occurred. When this cycle ended, Betsey�s body was slumped slightly in the chair to the right. �It�s over� I said softly to no one in particular.

&#9;At 0853 hrs, Dr. Tina confirmed this and pronounced Betsey dead. I stepped forward, closed Betsey�s eyes and kissed her on the forehead between the two electrodes. The world�s first euthanasia execution took twenty-three minutes. During Betsey's execution, the cycles of electricity, for each jolt, were officially recorded as follows: 

&nbsp;

&#9;Prior to Betsey�s execution, Jodie and she stated that it was Betsey�s last wish in her will to be neither buried nor cremated. Betsey was against burial because she did not wish to decompose in a casket. At the same time, she also did not wish to pollute the atmosphere with emissions from her cremation. She therefore willed that her body be donated for scientific research. 

&#9;Her electrocution will mean so much to so many.

BETSEY&#8217;S Execution - Part ONE

The Euthanasia and Right to Die Act of 2105, passed by our Legislature a few months ago, permits terminally-ill persons to petition the courts for permission to take their own lives by certain prescribed methods. One prescribed method, due to my lobbying efforts, is of course our electric chair. All the law requires is that two physicians must certify that the person is terminally-ill, and one psychiatrist must certify that the person is competent to petition the courts for permission to die. The person must be an adult and the petition must be a free and voluntary act. The person can also change her mind at anytime, and stop the execution process.

Betsey was an electrical engineer afflicted with a terminally-ill condition that privacy laws prohibit me from disclosing. We met while both lobbying in support of the Act on the Hill. She was in the early stages of her disease and said electrical euthanization appealed to her. �When done right, electricity will make a person go out like a light�, she intimated to me one night after a long day of lobbying. �I know honey�, I said. � I&#8217;ve seen it�. We laughed. I then relayed to her my experiences with Gina, Laura and the others. �Oh my� she said, �what you don&#8217;t read in the papers�. She giggled. A possible victim, I thought.&nbsp; 

During this time over dinner one night, she mentioned that we may have crossed paths before almost 20 years prior. A review of court archives revealed that Betsey had been arrested and pled guilty to a charge of misdemeanor lewd behavior in 2086. She had played a submissive role in lesbian romp in the cheerleaders&#8217; shower after the annual Pacifica State University homecoming football game. The bi-sexual escapades and trysts of the PSU football cheerleaders were no secret. It was only a matter of time before some or all were picked up on unlawful fornication charges. �I didn&#8217;t understand what the big deal was at time� she told me. �Being a lesbian was nothing new to me. The campus feminists hated us because we got all the guys and all the gals worth looking at. So they ratted us out out of pure jealousy.�
�I pled guilty and was miniaturized for 30 days�, she said in a little voice.
�I&#8217;ll have to get that video tape from departmental archives� I said. �You must have looked extremely edible all nude on the Reducing Table.�
�As I recall, it was cold in the Reduction Chamber on the day I was reduced� Betsey said. �I wasn&#8216;t scared or anything. In fact I was smiling until the lever was pulled and the procedure began. At the point I closed my eyes for some reason� she recalled.
�Most reductees do� I said.
�When I opened them, everything looked so huge� she said.
�But after entering that cold Chamber nude and wearing only those paper slippers, I couldn&#8217;t wait to get reduced because the body gets heated slightly as it de-molecularizes during the reduction process.�
�Sounds like you did some reading on the subject� I inquired.
�As I was an engineering major, the device always intrigued me�, she replied. �It sounded like fun and actually was when I experienced it myself. But I also knew that what we were doing was illegal and that some of us would get caught and be punished according to law so I wanted to educate myself so as to overcome any fears I might have if I got caught. But my research had the opposite effect: it actually emboldened me and this thinking spread to others on the squad. I was one of four PSU cheerleaders who were reduced that day, December 17, 2086.�

�I don&#8217;t think I worked that day� I said. �Or I may have been on holiday vacation or something like that. I missed all the good stuff Betsey. Back then at least.�
�Not now,� she said with a wink.
�You probably would gotten me into trouble� I said. �And I would have followed you to the Reducing Table.�
She winked and showed her tongue.
I&#8217;ve got to watch that videotape, I thought.

Betsey filed her petition the same day the Act passed and was signed into law by the Governor. Her method of choice for her euthanization: electrocution in one of Pacifica&#8216;s electric chair. Upon news of this, she immediately drew the attention of the media with her long shiny auburn hair, soft brown eyes and taut figure. She also incurred the wrath of anti-death penalty groups who vowed to oppose her every step of the way. Journalists seemed drawn to her. �How could such a stunningly beautiful, photogenic woman, volunteer for such a horrible fate?�, was the question asked over and over. Betsey always responded, �You will be torturing me to life, if you block my electrocution.� Her domestic partner Jodie {last name deleted} was her attorney and advocated her cause so brilliantly that even the judge who issued the order, himself an avid death penalty opponent, stated from the bench, �If this is what you want, I cannot deny your petition. The law is clear.� Anti-death penalty groups were stunned by the ruling, outraged at the judge and so focused on impeaching him, that they missed the deadline to appeal the judge&#8217;s ruling. Betsey was elated and immediately applied to the Governor for the earliest possible �appointment�. Her lawyer Jodie told me that Betsey&#8217;s mother died from the same condition, and Betsey remembered how her mom looked when she died. She was determined not to go through the same hell. �The chair isn&#8217;t exactly paradise counselor� I said. �No, but it&#8217;s quicker�, Jodie retorted.

In mid-August, Betsey received what she told the press was, �the happiest news in my life after being diagnosed six months before.� A notice arrived at her home from the State of Pacifica Department of Corrections, signed by me, which succinctly stated:

By decree duly entered by the Sinola County Court and the Governor of this State, you are to report no later than 0830 hrs on September 1, 2105, to the Women&#8217;s Correctional Institute at Sing Sing for euthanization in accordance with State law and your wishes. You are to be electrocuted on September 3, 2105 at 0830 hrs. You have the right to change your mind and decide not to proceed with this process at anytime.

In my office at the prison, I watched Betsey&#8217;s outdoor press conference, just outside the prison gates, where she was heckled by her opponents. She handled it with her usual �lan. She wore a navy blue chiffon dress which simply looked beautiful on her. Her hem fluttered in the breeze revealing a tiny bit of lace and nylon underneath. She thanked Jodie and all who supported her. She was asked what she was going to wear to her execution. She responded that that was up to the prison authorities. I smiled. Absolutely nothing, I thought.

BETSEY&#8217;S Execution - Part TWO

Betsey arrived at the Warden&#8217;s house, at 1630 hrs on August 31, 2105, sixteen hours earlier to avoid running the gauntlet of press and protestors. Her lawyer Jodie, who ran interference for her, arrived a short while after. I had previously explained to Betsey that she would enter the prison by a secret underground passageway �when your time has come�. So while the press, protestors and others gathered outside the prison&#8217;s main entrance to make noise and accomplish nothing, the three of us wined, dined, romanced and enjoyed each other. Betsey did not have to go through the usual process of intake, de-robing, the Reduction Chamber, etc. (I would have loved to reduce her, but instead I have only the video footage of her prior reduction from almost 20 years ago to enjoy). 

Betsey was being held in �special voluntary custody� at the Warden&#8217;s (i.e., my) house. However, at 0730 hrs the next morning, the Execution Protocol would commence. In two nights she would be sleeping in the death-house. And the day following would be her last. This of course, unless she changed her mind. We&#8216;ll have a lot of fun in the meantime, I thought as we fell asleep. She smelled great.

The next morning, September 1, 2105, at 0730 hrs, the process began. After breakfast, Betsey, Jodie and I entered the prison and proceeded to the death-house. There we were met by Senior Corrections Officer Debra {last name deleted}. At that time, in Debra&#8217;s office, next to the death chambers, we reviewed the specifications of each of our four electric chairs. Betsey selected Chair No. 1 saying to Debra, �The Warden tells me Gina went wild in this one�. I shrugged to Debra and who smiled saying, �No coaching, Warden!� Turning back to the executee, Debra said, �Is this the chair you want, Betsey?� Debra asked. �Yes�, Betsey replied sweetly. 

When the discussion turned to the subject of electrodes, Jodie and I left Betsey and her executioner alone for a few minutes in private. In parting, I told Debra, �Gina her�. �What&#8217;s that?� Betsey asked a quizzical expression on her face. �You&#8217;ll find out when the time comes, if you go through with it.� Betsey smiled. You&#8217;ve gotta do it, I thought.

In outside the room, Jodie confided to me that handling Betsey&#8217;s case cause her much conflict. She loved Betsey and was opposed to the death penalty, but felt her lover did not deserve to suffer. She said never imagined when she was in law school that she would have a case such as this with such consequences. Betsey and she had been partners since college and last year planned to marry until the bad news arrived. Jodie confided that she never thought that she would play such a role in ending Betsey&#8217;s life. I told Jodie that all she did was help her partner get the choice to die; the rest was up to Betsey. Jodie&#8217;s emotions got the best of her; she began to cry. We hugged.

Emerging from Debra&#8217;s office with a radiant smile, Betsey announced that she had opted for the golden electrodes. 
�Are you sure?�, I asked. 
�Yes, Warden� Betsey replied. �Gold is the best conductor of electricity.� 
�You might enjoy the chrome set better.� I replied, concerned because the vaginal electrode from only the chrome set vibrated, while its the gold set counterpart did not. Damn it, we won&#8217;t be able to Gina her, I thought. 
�Don&#8217;t worry Warden� Debra interrupted, �I have plenty of time to make the necessary modifications to our equipment.� Debra winked. 
�What are you talking about?� Betsey asked. 
�You&#8217;ll find out when the time comes, brave girl� I said, laughing with Debra. 
�No coaching Warden� Debra intoned. Betsey smirked. She&#8217;s gotta go through with it, I thought.

While Debra made her modifications to the gold vaginal electrode, Betsey, Jodie and I returned to the Warden&#8217;s house. Again as the protestors and press gathered outside, we did everything possible to make Betsey enjoy the little time she was going to have left. I my private basement dungeon, all the focus was on Betsey in preparing her for her ultimate sub experience. I watched Jodie undress Betsey. It was quite a sight. 

�My slip is showing�, Betsey said as she reached in her pocketbook producing some static guard. Standing up, she raised the front hem of her navy blue chiffon dress and sprayed her slip. �This usually doesn&#8217;t happen to me� Betsey confided. �There&#8217;s more behind you� Jodie lied, as she raised the back and side hems of Betsey&#8217;s dress, spraying. Betsey looked down over her shoulder sheepishly. She&#8217;s already full of electricity, I thought. After her press conference, I begged her to wear that dress for this occasion and to my pleasure she obliged. Jodie then proceed to unzip the back of Betsey&#8217;s dress. I became moist and my nipples erect as Betsey, looking down at Jodie, raised her arms overhead as Jodie raised and then lifted the dress up and away. Betsey was a beautiful sight in her lacy blue camisole and half-slip. What a shame to electrocute this! I thought. Her slip a had a lacy slit from the hem all the way to the waistband. Classy yet very sexy, I thought, as my heart raced. Jodie removed Betsey&#8217;s camisole and then stood back to admire her partner now clad in her bra and half-slip. I was soaked in sweat. Betsey then began to disrobe Jodie. 

Their eyes meet as Jodie ran her fingers along the waistband of Betsey&#8217;s half-slip, making Betsey giggle and her tummy twitch. I&#8217;ll be seeing that tummy twitch when her time comes, I thought. And she won&#8217;t be giggling either! These two women knew how to pleasure one another. Jodie then worked her way behind Betsey who, arms up-raised and cooing, craned her neck to one side and closed her eyes. Jodie then slid her hand under Betsey&#8217;s waistband eliciting a tense smile followed suddenly by gasp. Betsey&#8217;s mouth was agape, her eyes wide-open and filled with lesbian passion. Jodie began to nibble at her victim&#8217;s neck while I worked the tummy. Betsey squealed and squirmed. She loved it. I gently bit into her waistband and pulled it down over her buttocks, causing her slip to fall to the floor in a gentle swoosh, revealing her sheer beauty as well as her diamond-pierced navel. Naughty, yet discreet, I thought as she daintily stepped over her half-slip that had puddled at her feet.

Standing there in her lycra navy blue bra and low-rise, hi-cut briefs, garters, lacy thigh-highs and heels, Betsey began to cover up. Pulling down her victim&#8216;s arms, Jodie said, �Betsey come on, don&#8217;t be embarrassed, the Warden is not a stranger�. I pointed to the bed, and both walked over holding hands. As I was undressing, Jodie pushed Betsey by the tummy down on the bed. Sitting at the edge of the bed, Jodie removed Betsey&#8217;s bra, and I immediately began to feel envious and jealous of Betsey at how blessed she was. And in two days she&#8217;ll be gone, I thought as I joined in, removing Betsey&#8217;s undies so that she was bare like the rest of us. Only her nylons and heels remained. �Betsey honey, I&#8217;m glad you didn&#8217;t do anything foolish like go out and get a wax job or anything like that. Because we have something special in store for you tomorrow night, your last night.� I said. �What&#8217;s that?� she asked. I didn&#8217;t respond. You&#8217;ll see, I thought as a hooked my middle finger and slid it through her pubis and inside her. She closed her eyes and my finger immediately became wet. �Cuff her!� I instructed Jodie who immediately complied. �Sit her up!� I said. Again Jodie complied. I smiled, as did Betsey, when I found her spot. As she began to release, her hands were cuffed behind her back, she was sitting up and her hair to one side over her right shoulder, as I tried to pick her up with my hooked finger. Jodie pulled her hair back just right, biting her neck and shoulder. Betsey then completely lost control, having multiple orgasms before finally collapsing onto the bed. I then un-cuffed her out of mercy. �You are such a beautiful woman, Betsey,� I said. She smiled back as Jodie caressed her.

After re-hydrating ourselves, I sat on the bed behind Betsey and pulled her down, holding her arms in a full-Nelson. Jodie then spread our victim&#8217;s nyloned thighs and went to work, kissing, tasting, etc., etc., etc. Betsey screamed, squirmed, squealed and laughed. She went into overdrive when I released her from the Nelson and proceeded to rub her labium first side-to-side and then in a circular motion; slow then fast, then slow then very fast, etc., etc., etc. All this time she kept her arms over her head. �You are such a good sub� I whispered in her ear before licking her lobe. �That tickles!� she giggled. �She&#8217;s very ticklish� Jodie informed me. I smiled devilishly and then proceeded upstairs to fix some dinner in the kitchen.

When I returned twenty minutes later, Betsey was snuggled next to Jodie and fast asleep. Jodie was awake. �Let her rest� I whispered. �She&#8217;ll get more later� I said. �Let&#8217;s eat� I said. �I just did� Jodie retorted. Betsey smiled and giggled, eyes still closed. We ate and let the beauty sleep.
When we returned about an hour later, we decide to play some mind games with our victim. We pushed the clocks and calendar twenty-two hours ahead. I awoke Betsey by tickling her nyloned feet, electing a squirm and giggle. 
�Come on Betsey wake up!� I said, �We have to move. We are behind schedule.� 
�What?� she said. 
�You slept all last night and all day today.� I said. �It&#8217;s time to move you to the death house. Let&#8217;s go.� 
She was confused. Jodie and I were all dressed. 
�Give me a few minutes� she said. 
�Okay, five minutes� I said officially. 
�Can I help her Warden?� Jodie asked. 
�You may, counselor.� I said leaving them.
�Where is my jumpsuit� Betsey asked Jodie. �I&#8217;ll get it for you, honey� Jodie responded. When Jodie returned, she said she couldn&#8217;t find it but found something else. Producing a chrome vibrator, Jodie pushed Betsey by the shoulders back onto the bed. I then returned and asked what was going on. They mentioned the missing jumpsuit and I responded by saying �Don&#8217;t worry we have until tomorrow to find it�. Betsey, disoriented as to date and time, was totally confused. 
�You mean my appointment has been re-scheduled?� Jodie then told her what we did with the date and time. 
�You assholes!� she replied. 
�Shut up and lay down!� Jodie said turning on the vibrator. The next thing I heard was Betsey squealing to the sound of the vibrator buzzing up against her pierced navel and then her lower tummy. Multiple orgasms again! I thought. Do these two know how to make each other happy!
After a few minutes, Jodie turned off the vibrator, and at my request, applied some KY to it and Betsey. 
�You obviously don&#8217;t need it now doll� I said. �but you&#8217;ll need it, as a conductor, the morning after next. So let&#8217;s let apply a pre-execution coat to your insides now.� 
�I agree, Warden� Betsey replied.
�I don&#8217;t care if you agree,� I retorted, �Protocol is protocol!� 

Turning on the vibrator again, Jodie proceeded around and around and around Betsey&#8217;s labium, repeatedly circling her prize. Her arms again overhead, Betsey&#8217;s beautiful face bore more and more tension with each buzzing revolution. She opened her mouth and let out an occasional sigh or moan as she ejaculated over and over and over again. Jodie was laughing. �You&#8217;re enjoying this, aren&#8217;t you love?� Jodie asked. 

Betsey sighed and closed her eyes in response. 

Then as Jodie again reached the top of her labium, Betsey partially sat up, looked down at her partner, lowered one of her arms, and with her left hand, gently pressed down on the vibrator which slid in so naturally. At this moment, Betsey, head quivering, eyes glazed over, at once laid back down, closed her eyes, inhaled deeply and arched her back. She began raking, then twisting, first her left nipple, then her right nipple, with her right hand, while rubbing her labium with the other. Jodie again began kissing and tasting her victim. It was pure lesbian passion. I just sat there, watched and took it all in, not wanting to disturb a thing. It was so perfect. I just wish I had videotaped this since mere words cannot do justice. When she was done, Jodie removed the vibrator very slowly, while increasing its speed as she reached one of Betsey&#8217;s special spots. Betsey again arched her back, etc., and lost control. Do these women know each other or what, I thought. Once out, Betsey now sitting up straight, ran her arms and hands through her long long hair and let out a big sigh, again collapsing on the bed in total exhaustion. She looked beautiful. Jodie then asked for silence as she placed her ear near Betsey&#8217;s prize. �It&#8217;s still growling!� she said. I laughed as did Betsey, lazily. As she and Jodie cuddled, they invited me to join in, which I did graciously. �Rest up, Betsey� I said there is more fun tomorrow, you last full day.� I hope. She moaned in acquiescence, nuzzling next to me.

�Are you nervous about being electrocuted?� I asked.
�Nope. I think Jodie is more nervous about it than I am.�
We both looked at Jodie, who just stared at the ceiling, shook her head and closed her eyes in disbelief. It was 0100 hrs.

BETSEY&#8217;S Execution - Part THREE

I awoke Betsey at 0700 hrs on September 2, 2105, her last full day. I hope. She was in a deep sleep from the frolicking of the previous night. I licked her ear lobe which tickled her awake. 
�Wake up doll. Rise and shine.� I said.
�Mmmmhmmmm�, she said.
Laying behind her, Jodie embraced her partner whispering, �Come on dear, get up.� Betsey complied.

Sitting up, Betsey ran her arms through her hair again. I couldn&#8217;t resist - I began manipulating her nipples which brought a sleepy laugh from her. �I wish we had met sooner honey� I said. �There&#8217;s still time.� Betsey replied. I then left Jodie and Betsey alone while I prepared breakfast.

Over breakfast, Betsey announced that she would discuss today with Debra, the possible placement of the optional electrodes for her execution. The mandatory electrodes for Betsey&#8217;s execution were as follows: 2 pasty-electrodes on the fore-head, 1 black-pad electrode at the base of the neck, 1 black-pad electrode at the base of spine, 1 gold-plug vaginal electrode (with speculum), 1 gold-plug anal electrode and 1 gold-bar electrode at each ankle). Betsey announced that she decided that, for her electrocution, she also wanted optional electrodes placed as follows: 

- 2 pasty-electrodes on each breast astride each nipple, 
- 5 black-pad electrodes to the abdomen (with 1 over the navel); 
- 4 black-pad electrodes to the lower back; 
- 2 black-pad electrodes at each hip; 
- 2 pasty electrodes to each buttock;
- 2 pasty electrodes to the upper inside of each thigh;
- 1 blue-band electrode around each thigh, calf and bicep; and,
- the high-heels electrodes - 1 per foot.
�You&#8217;re taking no chances Betsey� I said.
�Nope� she said. �I want it over quick.�
�Sounds like you are going for a record: the most electrodes.

Debra who had joined us for breakfast stated, �There is no such thing as overkill in an execution�. Gallows humor.
Debra also suggested Betsey wear the brine-soaked sponge socks on her feet since she opted for the heels. �It will also work well with the ankle electrodes.� She advised.
�Cut off the ends so I can see her toes curl� I said. Again, gallows humor.
�Gee thanks, Warden,� Betsey replied.
Jodie remained silent throughout and picked at her food.
Betsey then got up from the table and said she need to get dressed. 
�What?� I said.
�Get dressed, Warden. I have to . . . .�
�I don&#8217;t think so� I said opening her red silk robe and showing Debra her beauty.
�Debra?�
�Yes, Warden�
�Did you bring the sybian?�
�Per your order.�
�Oh my� Betsey replied.
�You&#8217;re familiar with it, Betsey?�
She smiled back.
Jodie&#8217;s face light up.
�Let&#8216;s take Betsey for one last ride.�
Betsey was again cuffed and lead downstairs to the dungeon.

Betsey selected the flat-top attachment for her ride. When the sybian is activated, the attachment vibrates at various speeds and in various directions. The rider, who sits astride the black-leather sybian, literally has the ride of her life, regardless of the attachment used. The flat-top attachment is ribbed and also has a protrusion measuring about 1 inch in height which in Betsey&#8217;s case hit the spot, literally. Again, I watched while Jodie and Debra did all the work. Betsey donned her favorite pair of black lacy nylon thigh-highs. Debra ordered her to mount the device and she complied. Betsey then closed eyes as she made herself comfy. Her sunglasses and facial harness were put on. The harness included a mouth-piece and chin-strap which would be used in her electrocution. She was then roped up - Debra&#8217;s specialty. Her wrists were bound and her arms were raised overhead. After finishing roping-up Betsey&#8217;s ankles and thighs, Debra nodded to Jodie who activated the sybian at exactly 8:30 AM. This time tomorrow . . . , I thought.
Immediately, Betsey&#8217;s eyebrows rose above her sunglasses. She&#8217;s enjoying this. Debra began fondling Betsey&#8217;s cleavage as her breasts bounced.

�Don&#8217;t do that twenty-fours from now Debra� I joked.
Debra laughed. I could hear Betsey manage a stifled laugh through her mouthpiece. Gallows humor. Jodie then increased the sybian&#8217;s speed and intensity. Betsey squirmed, twitched, tried to stand up on her knees, but due to Debra&#8217;s fine rope work, she could only move just a few inches. There was no relief from the intensity of what was happening to her. Her hair was flying all around her head. She was bathed in perspiration. She again smelled great. Debra then unbound Betsey&#8217;s ankles and thighs and allowed her to stand and catch her breath. 

Jodie then slid the sybian out from under Betsey and the flat-top was replaced by my choice of attachment: the G-Max. This attachment has a protrusion about 2 inches in height with a rotating vibrating ball on the end. The device was then slid back under Betsey who again willingly straddled it. As she squirmed for comfort, Debra rebound her feet and ankles, but lowered her arms down in front of Betsey. Jodie re-activated the device with the usual reaction. Betsey seemed to be experiencing an earthquake as she trembled violently. As Debra and I observed, we brainstormed. We then came upon an idea. We whispered our idea to Jodie who looked at Betsey and nodded enthusiastically. �She&#8217;ll love it� she said.

As Betsey rode, Debra and I retrieved some electrical equipment from a corner in the basement. Before inquiring of Betsey, we decided she should have some respite. While the four of us talked about Betsey&#8217;s big day tomorrow and what would happen to her, she gave no indication of her intentions. She indicated that the facial harness fit perfectly. She remained bound and astride the sybian and talked about her previous experience with electro-stimulation. Jodie intimated that she brought along Betsey&#8217;s favorite electrode: nipple suction cup electrodes. 

�Can these be used tomorrow at my execution?� Betsey inquired.
�No� I replied. �Only official state equipment may be used for liability reasons. That&#8217;s Protocol, Betsey.�
Betsey and Jodie appeared downcast until I said that nothing prevented us from using their toy today.
Debra then proceeded to raise up Betsey&#8217;s arms one last time. I filled the clear plastic suction cups with KY, which doubles as a great conductor and adhesive and applied some jelly to her nipples, which instantly grew as hard as pencil erasers. I then wired up and secured the suction cups to each nipple with wing-nuts.

�Let&#8217;s go without the harness this time, okay Betsey?�
�Sure� she said.
Jodie then activated the sybian one last time and Betsey again closed her eyes as she entered into her gyrations. This time we could hear her enjoy her last sybian ride. I hope. As Betsey ejaculated, Debra sensing the right moment turned on the current which caused Betsey to stiffen and strain again the ropes as she tried to fold over. She was screaming so loud, that Debra lowered the voltage. At the lower voltage, Betsey gave off a buzzing-gurgling sound. Her sweat dripped onto the sybian. I then told Jodie and Betsey to turn everything off which they did. Drenched, Betsey said, �That was awesome.� I hope we encouraged you for tomorrow, I thought. 

After lunch, we put Betsey to bed. She slept until 1800 hrs while Jodie, Debra and I plotted one more surprise. Jodie cooked Betsey her favorite: baked scrod and scallops with bread crumbs and lemon and salad. I sincerely hoped that this would be Betsey&#8217;s last meal. I took in Betsey&#8217;s beauty while there was still time. After dinner, Betsey asked for her orange jumpsuit. Jodie, Debra and I looked at each other and laughed.
�What&#8217;s the joke, I have to report to the death-house by 8:30 PM don&#8217;t I?� 
�Yes Betsey, but you will not arrive in a prison jumpsuit.� I said. 
�I have to walk through the passageway naked!?� she asked incredulously. 
�Nope� I said. �Orange is not your best color. And black latex looks better on you anyway.�
Jodie and Debra nodded in unison.
�I don&#8216;t understand� she said.
�Come with us.� I said.

As Betsey proceeded with us downstairs to the passageway between the Warden&#8217;s house and the death-house, I told her, �We have one more fetish of yours to satisfy, don&#8216;t we?�.
�I think I know what you have in mind� she giggled in reply. 
�Oh?� I said.
As we rounded the corner, she discovered how right she was.
�Strip!� I ordered.
�Nope� she smiled back.
Playing hard to get? Or is she getting cold feet?
I opened Betsey&#8217;s robe again as Debra stealthily approached from behind her with a vacuum hose. Betsey was de-robed in one quick slurp. Again she covered up sheepishly.
�Remove the heels and nylons too!�
�Yes Warden, ma&#8217;am.�
Just as I thought, playing hard to get. 
Debra vacuumed the nylons off the floor and then said �You&#8217;ll get everything back once you are in the death-house� as she turned the vacuum off.
Jodie watched from the background.
�Get in, Betsey!� Debra ordered.
Betsey rested her buttocks on the edge of the gurney and the frame of the black vac-bed. She looked up at us.
�Polish me up, nice and shiny� she said as she climbed in, winking.
�We promise�, I said.
As she adjusted the breathing tube, Debra attached the hose to the vac-bed.
As I put my ear to the tube and heard and felt the executee breathing, I nodded to Debra who turned on the vacuum cleaner. As the latex closed in and around her voluptuous figure, Betsey squirmed. Too bad she is laying on her back. Her ass must look awesome. I heard some object getting sucked first through the frame and then through the hose. �Sounds like one of her toe rings� Debra surmised with a devilish grin. I grinned back shaking my head. She loves this. When Betsey was fully sealed, the vacuum cleaner gave off a high pitched whine. Debra then sealed the frame valve, disconnected the hose and turned off the vacuum. All sealed in, Jodie, Debra and I proceeded to buff and polish Betsey to a lusty shine, giving special attention to certain areas. She giggled and squirmed against the latex as her nipples, tummy and other areas were buffed. Debra then departed for the death-house to receive the executee. Jodie went back upstairs to the Warden&#8217;s house to prepare for her role as official witness tomorrow morning. Alone with Betsey, I asked, can you breathe okay, honey?� Through the latex Betsey nodded and gave a thumbs up. She was then wheeled to her final destination by prison staff completely encased in latex.

BETSEY&#8217;S Execution - Part FOUR

Upon arrival at the death-house at 1900 hrs, the vac-bed was unsealed by Debra and Betsey emerged. 
�I think I lost one of my toe rings.� she said. 
�We figured as much.� I replied. 
�I was right� said Debra producing the toe ring, robe and nylons, along with Betsey&#8217;s heels. 
�You&#8217;ll get those back once you undergo pubis removal� I said.
�What?�
�Pubis removal.� said Debra. 
�And that&#8217;s my area of expertise, honey� said Sergeant Stella {last name deleted} stepping forward. Stella then explained the procedure to Betsey and its necessity. Betsey said that due to her professional background she understood the fire hazard risk.
�I&#8217;ve never done this before, but I&#8217;m game.� Betsey said eyes fluttering. �You&#8217;ll love it� I said winking.
�Just sit back, relax and do as I say, honey. Gina loved it; Laura found it kinky.� Pillows were placed under Betsey&#8217;s shoulders so she could watch what would be done to her next. 
Debra with Stella&#8217;s assistance coiled rope half-a-dozen times around Betsey&#8217;s gams, snug enough to hold Betsey in place but not too tight to cut off circulation. The coils were then looped and tied to the headboard, while her ankles were tied off and looped at the side posts. This caused Betsey&#8217;s legs to move back and spread open, fully exposing her. �Have fun you two� Debra said in departing, �I&#8217;ll be back.� �We will� Stella said with her hand on Betsey washboard tummy. Betsey was giggling in anticipation. Stella then went to work. She turned the death-house canister vacuum on low suction, and handed the hose nozzle to Betsey whose hands remained free, for the time being. Stella then turned on the electric clippers and instructed Betsey to hold the nozzle wherever she was trimming to pick up clippings. Betsey obliged much to her delight. She kept looking down at Stella throughout the whole process, her glazed, sultry eyes full of lesbian passion. When she finished trimming, Stella took the nozzle from Betsey and gently pushed her down on the prison bed. Again Betsey obliged laying back, resting slightly elevated on the pillows so she could watch. Debra then reentered the room and finished roping up Betsey. Betsey&#8217;s wrists were bound, her arms were placed (comfortably this time) over her head, and looped and tied off, again at the headboard. �Having fun aren&#8217;t we?�, Debra whispered to Betsey. Betsey moaned in the affirmative.

Attaching a corner attachment to the nozzle, Stella proceeded to vacuum Betsey&#8217;s labium, clitoris and vulva causing her victim to squeal and squirm against her binds. By now Betsey&#8217;s voice was becoming hoarse from the exertion of the past few days.

�I&#8217;m so fatigued from all the orgasms I&#8217;ve had over these last few days.� she said. Is she hinting that she&#8217;s going to go through with it! I thought. Please, go through with it! Please! �Don&#8217;t worry� Debra said, �you&#8217;ll have at least one or two more before you&#8217;re done here�. Betsey smiled weakly and laughed. Stella continued her work. Bound Betsey just laid there and enjoyed herself. When Stella finished, Betsey was soaked in sweet. Her pubis was gone except for a tiny patch of fur which would be safely away from any electrodes. But we had to make sure. Debra approached her. 
�Can we try something, Betsey?�
�What?�
�How well you conduct down there.�
�What?!�
�We want to see how safely you&#8217;ll conduct down there for tomorrow morning.�
�Okay, just don&#8217;t kill me!�
�That&#8217;s up to you, honey.�
�What are you going to use, Debra?�
�Pasty-electrodes on the upper insides of your thighs, for starters, then we&#8217;ll see, if it&#8217;s alright with you.�
Betsey nodded.
After she hooked up Betsey, Debra activated the TENS unit causing Betsey to lunge against the ropes and yelp. Lowering the voltage, Debra observed Betsey beam a smile at her. Debra then turned off the voltage.
�More?�
Betsey nodded a yes.

Debra then coated both a black plug electrode and Betsey&#8217;s labium, vulva and clitoris with KY. She slid in the plug with Betsey looking down, helpless. After hooking up the black plug, Debra again activated then TENS unit, lighting up Betsey who squirmed and struggled against the ropes. I applied a massager for a brief moment. Again Betsey ejaculated, squirming hooting and howling. After the power was turned off, she just laid there and smiled at us, all tied up.

Betsey was completely exhausted when she lay down in her cell adjacent to Death Chamber No. 1. She fell asleep at 2200 hours.

BETSEY&#8217;S Execution - Part FIVE

At 0600 hrs, Betsey awoke in her death cell, was served her last meal, breakfast, and she ate all of it. She had her breakfast alone with Jodie and they talked about was going to happen. After a long hug, they departed at 0730 hrs. Betsey was smiling, Jodie, with a stiff upper lip was fighting back tears.
�Please don&#8217;t this Betsey. Take an injection instead. Don&#8217;t electrocute yourself.�
�Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll be free shortly.�
Betsey smiled. Jodie sobbed.
Betsey then asked me the execution was on schedule and I said yes. 
She then showered and afterward K.S., our prison beautician, put Betsey&#8216;s hair in a bun, and did her nails and make-up. It was 0815 hrs.

At 0820 hrs, the door to Death Chamber No. 1 opened. Betsey entered gracefully and demurely sat in the hot seat. As she was being strapped in and hooked up, Betsey said in her final statement that she was proceeding with her execution so that others may freely exercise their constitutional right to die in the future. Debra came forward, kissed Betsey on the left cheek and wished her good luck. I stepped forward and kissed her forehead one final time which made her smile. On the other side of the glass partition, the sole witness, Jodie sobbed softly. Stella and K.S. consoled her. As Debra attached the electrodes, Betsey had a look in her eyes in which she appeared to be excited about being electrocuted. Aside from squirming and faint sighs and squeals when the anal and vaginal electrodes were inserted and the speculum adjusted, she offered no resistance. The facial harness, mouthpiece and chin strap were secured. A switch was placed in her right hand. Debra would arm the chair, but her computer was programmed for euthanasia executions to deliver a fatal jolt of electricity only of the executee depressed the red �hot-switch� button. 

At 0821 hrs, Debra began arming the chair by computer. The minutes passed by slowly while Betsey sat in Chair No.1 perspiring. Debra completed the arming process at exactly 0830 hrs, when the window for Betsey&#8217;s execution officially opened. After clicking the lightning bolt icon on her monitor, Debra stated, �The chair is armed� in her usual cold and official tone of voice, over the low hum in the background. �The chair is all yours Betsey�, she said encouragingly. Would she do it? If so, would my surprise �Gina� her? A few seconds after 0830 hrs, we found out. As if in super slow motion, Betsey&#8217;s thumb slowly but deliberately, depressed the �hot-switch� and the first jolt of 2500 volts of electricity raced through her lovely body for 60 seconds. Her eyes slammed shut and her body strained against the straps holding her in Chair No. 1 as she instinctively struggled to escape. Yes! Yes! Yes! She did it! Go girl! Go! She took the jolt, and her nubile body twitched and convulsed as if she was about to jump out of the chair! For a moment I wondered if the leather straps would hold her. But of course they always do. Her beautiful figure then slammed against the back of the electric chair. Her tummy tightened and twitched. Her breasts bounced as she struggled desperately in the chair. Is she having second thoughts? Too late now! I could see how hard Betsey&#8217;s nipples were getting from the electricity. Juicing her had made her nipples very erect. No, she&#8217;s having fun. 

Her soft brown eyes, now agony-filled, opened wide. Her pupils danced from side-to-side and then rolled back as the electricity took control of her body and mind. Some sizzling was noted, but the smell of burning flesh was absent. The usual puff of white steam was observed rising from her ankles and small sparks briefly appeared in the navel area. An small arc was observed over the speculum and vaginal electrode. This notwithstanding, a post-execution examination revealed that all the electrodes had been adequately moistened with either KY or brine solution, and no skin had been burned during the electrocution process. Perspiration fizzed creating additional steam arising from Betsey&#8217;s body, creating a sweet scent in the chamber. I observed her toes curling downward. A slight frothing at the mouth was also noticed during the first jolt. Muffled howls and screams, a la Gina, were heard. Nice job Debra!

In the six minutes the Protocol allowed for this hot body to cool from 145� F before Dr. Tina {last name deleted} could safely conduct an examination, Betsey visibly struggled to breathe, her breasts rose and fell with each labored breath, but at that point she was very likely already brain dead. In any event, she was dying quicker than if she had let her disease run its course. 

At 0838 hrs, Betsey was administered a second 90 second jolt of electricity. She made a muffled, fuzzy, gurgling sound. Her death rattle, I thought. Again, the cycle stopped and Dr. Tina stepped forward, stethoscope in hand, to exam Betsey. Dr. Tina reported that Betsey&#8217;s heart was still beating, and that she was very much alive. 

At 0846 hrs, a third and final jolt of electricity, 30 seconds in duration, was passed through Betsey. Minor frothing in the mouth and sizzling again occurred. When this cycle ended, Betsey&#8217;s body was slumped slightly in the chair to the right. �It&#8217;s over� I said softly to no one in particular.

At 0853 hrs, Dr. Tina confirmed this and pronounced Betsey dead. I stepped forward, closed Betsey&#8217;s eyes and kissed her on the forehead between the two electrodes. The world&#8217;s first euthanasia execution took twenty-three minutes. During Betsey's execution, the cycles of electricity, for each jolt, were officially recorded as follows: 




Cycle


Volts


Amps


Ohms




1


2,500


9.7


215.2




2


675


3.1


222.6




3


1,900


9.1


233.1






Prior to Betsey&#8217;s execution, Jodie and she stated that it was Betsey&#8217;s last wish in her will to be neither buried nor cremated. Betsey was against burial because she did not wish to decompose in a casket. At the same time, she also did not wish to pollute the atmosphere with emissions from her cremation. She therefore willed that her body be donated for scientific research. 

Her electrocution will mean so much to so many.
