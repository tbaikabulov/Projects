Testimony of Shiu Lin, Female, 24

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

In the hospital my friend showed me the burn marks about her
mouth, nipples, and genitals. She whispered she was sorry she had named me. But
I forgave her, because under torture one will say anything. I knew I would be
arrested as soon as I returned home. I resolved to accept the hard times to
come with dignity and fortitude, according to our teachings. Nor did I deny,
then or now, that I was indeed a member of the so-called &quot;evil cult.&quot;

��������� 

At the police station my interrogator immediately stripped me
naked. They say arrestees may have secret messages taped to their bodies. Or,
especially in the case of women, inside them. My interviewer lingered long over
my bare skin, probing me with insolent fingers, hoping to provoke resistance,
teasing me with comments about the involuntary responses of my body. I did not
reveal to him the humiliation I felt, nor the anger. I gave him no reason to
beat me or touch his fiery baton to my sensitive parts. Thus I denied him his
favorite sport. Such cruel men often join the police. And our State happily
employs them.

��������� 

I was denied clothes the rest of the day and night. Smirking
guards came by my cell and forced me to stand for inspection. Upon their
orders, I assumed embarrassing positions and spoke the dirty words they
demanded. This excited them further and they asked certain naughty favors from
me, their hands on their electric batons. I complied fully.

&nbsp;

The next morning I was given only a thin smock to cover my
nakedness. Outside the prison was a cattle truck with slatted sides waiting to
take me away. It was open to the sky. There were three other young women
similarly dressed. We were loaded up, chained together at the ankles.

&nbsp;

There were two guards and a driver. One guard always sat in back
with us.

His strange sense of humor was always at our expense. After some
hours, we stopped. We lined up roadside in our chains and watched as the men
unzipped and watered the ground.

&nbsp;

&quot;That's how it's done, ladies. Now let's see you do it.&quot;
They were laughing.

&nbsp;

It is hard for a woman to do standing up, even more embarrassing
to squat. But I took opportunity when offered, not knowing when it might come
again. Li Li, a foolish girl not yet 20 years of age, complained. A village man
was approaching on a bicycle, and she did not want him to see her private
parts. The guards responded by pulling her smock entirely off. They said they
would whip her if she did not pee. The bicyclist stopped and joked with the
guards as she faced him and blushingly wet the dust.

��������� ��������� 

Then the villager left and suddenly the guards were no longer
laughing. They looked differently at Li Li. One dragged her naked and crying
into the cab of the truck while the other loaded we three into the rear. Twenty
minutes later, the guards exchanged places. Then the driver took his turn.

&nbsp;

We drove for two days. When it rained, we could do nothing but
shiver and open our mouths. Finally we arrived at the re-education camp.

&nbsp;

We were taken immediately to the office of superintendent Wu. Our
chains and smocks were removed and we stood at attention, chests thrust out. Li
Li immediately started to complain about guard rape. Wu seemed very surprised.
He made a gesture, and Li Li was dragged into the adjoining room. Soon we heard
her screaming and begging for mercy, offering her body to them. Then the
screams ended. We never saw her again.

&nbsp;

Wu explained the only two rules. Always obey a guard. Never speak.

&nbsp;

We worked long hours every day, making goods for export to Hong
Kong.

There they would be certified as not being made with slave labor
so they could legally go to the United States. Children abroad would play with
toys once smeared with tears and blood.

&nbsp;

The food was very bad and very scarce. There was no way to get
clean. After a while I could not smell myself, but I knew I stank, for all the
others did. I lost weight rapidly at first, then more slowly. Soon nothing was
real to me but hunger.

&nbsp;

Some women who had been there a long time had swollen bellies and
thinning hair. It was due to lack of protein. Others did not suffer quite as
much. These were the prettier ones the guards would sometimes lead away.

The guards would look happy when they brought them back. I came to
understand that these women pleased men with their mouths so as to get a small
protein drink. One does what one must do to survive. In time I came to envy
them, but I was not pretty or young enough to be chosen.

&nbsp;

One day I was in the toilets, which were only a series of
squat-holes in the floor, with no privacy. One of the guards that were always
watching approached me as I was doing my business. I kept my eyes down, as we
had been taught.

&nbsp;

&quot;Come with me. You will take a shower.&quot;

&nbsp;

I was filled with joy, as my skin itched everywhere. My hair was
matted.

&nbsp;

I drew off my smock outside the cubicle, but kept it in my hand,
hoping to wash it. By then being naked in front of a guard did not bother me. I
stepped inside and turned on the warm water. Then I was surprised. The guard,
naked, was joining me. My eyes were still cast down, so I could see what he had
in mind. He applied soap to those parts of mine an excited man most wants to
touch. Twice I brought soapsuds from between my legs to my hair, and twice he
replaced them. When my smock and I were well washed, he brought my soapy hands
forward to caress his hardness. Then he pressed me against the wall and
entered. Fortunately the soap provided lubrication, for I had none to give, nor
did I take pleasure. I had been hungry too long to think of sex.

&nbsp;

Yet it was worth it to be clean. I must have pleased the guard,
because two days later he came to me again and led me to a private room. A
mattress lay on the floor. He reached into his pocket and brought out something
wrapped in greasy newspaper. It was a fried chicken leg, and it was for me!

&nbsp;

Nothing in the world existed but that leg, and when I had gnawed
it clean, I broke it open and sucked out the marrow, licked my fingers, licked
the newspaper, tried to eat the bone itself. Then I gave a sigh and drew off my
smock, lay down, opened my legs. 

&nbsp;

This time he was in no hurry. He had to caress me a long time
before my wetness finally came. It had been so long since I spoke that my voice
sounded strange when I invited him inside. As he took his pleasure, so did I.

&nbsp;

Now for some weeks we followed this same pattern. He could have
had me for free. Instead he chose to engage my heart by bringing me food. And
as my body became stronger, so did my desire. I know now he saved my life.

&nbsp;

Often workers were taken from the workroom floor to a room where a
man harangued us. We were supposed to renounce the antisocial cult. If they
felt we were sincere, we would be shipped home. But I could not do it, though
sometimes my lover would whisper to me while I lay in his arms.

&nbsp;

&quot;Do it! What does it matter? They may suspect you are lying,
but they want to look good to their superiors. And they need to show that a
certain number each month have renounced.&quot;

&nbsp;

But I would not. Yet I was released. If papers exist showing that
I renounced, they are forged. 

&nbsp;

I think Li Li died the day we arrived, and I saw many others die
of starvation, of disease, of whippings and beatings, of electroshock. I have
not given the name of my lover, to protect him. But I offer this testimony,
which will be smuggled out of the country, in honor of the many thousands who
have suffered and died in the camps.

&nbsp;

All were innocent of any harm to the state. Some day we will be
free.

Then our testimonies will turn against our accusers, and they will
be brought to justice. This I swear.
