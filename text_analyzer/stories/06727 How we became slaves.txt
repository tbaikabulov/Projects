Synopsis: Husband and wife find out that their best friends are in fact Mistress and slave. Their journey to how all three now serve their Owner         






They had been friends of us for a few years. But everything was about to change this night...

My wife Claire and i have been married for 10 years now. You could say it has been a save and steady relationship. Our friendship is very strong, but our love life has been a bit shaky. After the first years the sparks just went away, and we tried lots of stuff to get this back. Sometimes this was pretty successful, other times it was a mess. Of course we tried a bit of bondage, power play and stuff like that, but we soon found out we both were very submissive on that part. This was a discovery that led to a major breakthrough in both our lives. Since we weren't able to play the part or role the other would like him or her to play, we decided to seek help. We turned to a pro dom/domme couple and from that moment on, never again were our days (and nights for that matter) the same. But still, it was only play...

Claire is in her early 30's, and holds a very secure job as a doctor. As for me, i'm 35, a manager at the largest bank of the country (we live in Belgium) and even if i say so myself, pretty successful. We own our own villa, with a pool and a tennis court. Since my seed is not vital enough, we have only two dogs and 3 cats. When we discovered our mutual interest in BDSM, we had our cellar turned into a dungeon. We played there with the prodom couple, and even with the occasional bi sexual Dom or Domme we met at parties, which we attended, always at least 100 Miles from our home. None of our close friend were aware of our kink. At least, that is what we thought...

Kim and Pierre have been in our lives as long as we can remember. We shared laughs, tears and a lot of food and wine! They were there for us when we found out that we wouldn't have any kids, and al i can say is that they have been the best friends you could wish. They always seemed a stable vanilla, perhaps even boring couple. Kim and Pierre have two beautiful kids. Simone and William. They both attend the same boarding school in the UK. As you can imagine, Kim and Pierre are loaded. We are financially secure, but their fortune is huge. And even with that, they seemed to be the most down to earth couple you would ever meet...

Last February Claire and were very much looking forward to attending a BDSM party in Bruges. We had been to the same party twice before, and met a couple which we have been playing on a sort of regular basis. This couple, Dick and Virginia (these names we only used once, since then we know them as Ma'am and Sir) would not be attending the February Munch, but we were still looking forward on going. We got dressed. I was wearing leather pants and a black cotton t-shirt. Because of the cold February night, i wore a full length leather coats over all of it. Claire even told me i looked a bit dominant. She was wearing her favourite outfit. A green and black latex dress, which made a wonderful cracking sound when the shirt part was lifted up to reveal her perfect bottom. The only thing missing was a collar on both our necks...

We arrived at the party and felt welcome form the get go. We said hi to a few regulars, some of which needed no transition period to "get into it". We both did. We both had our own ritual of getting into a subspace state. Claire always went to the bar, had a talk with the bartender and then ordered 10 glasses of white wine. With her head bowed, we then went through the room and asked all submissive partners if they would like a glass. It would normally take her about 30 minutes to get all her drinks away. In this time she would have been ordered to kneel down at least 15 times. This did it for her. I have a completely different ritual. Kneeling is my thing. I take out a card that i made, and get in a high kneel in front of the little girls room. On my card it reads: "Please let me know which position for this slave would be pleasing to You, Ma'am". This calls out for a reaction, i can tell you that. Everything from a humiliating look to a spit in the face has been my part. But on this night, something that i never could have imagined happened...

As i kneeled with my hands spread out and my forehead on the floor, i felt that someone stood just an inch away from my stretched fingers. She just stood there without saying a word. This was pure tension, as i knew she was looking at me, and taking time to enjoy it. i had almost started to lift my head up a bit to see what kind of boots or shoes she was wearing, as she ordered: Don't move, I&#8217;ll be right back. Could it be.. No way... But... My heart went into a rollercoaster ride, beating 200 bpm. I could have sworn this had been the voice of Kim, our close, long and dear friend. As i tried to discard this thought (Kim and Pierre were the most conservative couple we knew) i relaxed a bit. But i kept as still as i could. Not daring to look up and find out it was in fact Kim. This would have been too much. The humiliation of me kneeling there and our dear friend Kim would have been killing. All of a sudden i heared someone running over. Claire grabbed me by my shoulders and dragged me into the toilet. She looked as if she had seen a ghost, and i knew exactly which ghost she had seen. Pure fear was in her eyes. Before she could start to talk, the door of the toilet went open and in the doorway where she was. Kim. She looked stunning, but in a way i had never imagined. She wore a long black leather shirt and a black designer top, which by it self could have been even a bit vanilla. The combination of the leather with the refined top made her look very, very classy and utterly dominant. Around her neck there was a string of pearls. Her high leather boots were laced on the front. In her hand she held a small leash. "Well, Well" She said. "Who would imagine seeing you guys here". "John, i liked it better when you were still kneeling, and Claire, get me a glass of wine". Could this be happening? i looked Claire in the eyes for a split second, and as if a supernatural force took over, i got on my knees and kneeled with my head on the floor. Claire took a small step back and Kim got a bit closer. Behind Kim there was Pierre. He had a blindfold on and was on the other end of the leash Kim held in her hand. "Pierre, it's really them", She said. Pierre took his blindfold off and gave Claire a huge smile. "How about that wine" Kim said in an ordering voice. Without saying a word, Claire almost ran out of the toilet and sat down in a booth at the end of the establishment. She laid her head in her hands and started crying. As i felt there was something wrong, i stood up and walked over to her and sat down next to her. She looked at me and her eyes were all wet. The only thing she said there and then was: "it will never be the same".

Kim and Pierre followed us for about 30 minutes without getting nearer to us. When they saw that we both had eased down a bit, Pierre walked over and said: "Don't worry. Your secret was a big as ours. We know why we enjoy this, and we think we know why you do too". I suggested that we should leave, but Claire had really found her composure. She stood up and walked to Kim, who was still a few meters away. Pierre and i just looked at them, but couldn't hear what they were saying. After what seemed an eternity, but in fact was just 2 minutes, Claire kissed Kim on the mouth, turned around and walked back to us. "Let's go" she said. "But..", "No buts!", and she walked to the exit. I turned to Pierre and said: "Well, see you, aye?" and i followed my wife out of the bar.

As we walked to our car, i walked next to Claire. "What did you talk about" i asked. Claire said nothing, didn't look at me and just walked in her steady pace. We got into the car and i was just about to turn the ignition, when Claire took my hand. "Tomorrow, we'll go to Kim's and Pierres. We are expected at 10 AM. There you will find out what we talked about". "WHAT" i shouted. "Please don't ask anything, don't say anything, just trust me and drive". I just sat there with my eyes closed, thinking about what Claire had just said. Trust me? Could i? There had never been a moment in our lives together where i wouldn't have trusted her with my life. After a very disturbing minute, i started the car, put it in reverse and drove off. We didn't say another word until the next morning...

It had been rough getting to sleep. My thoughts kept me awake until 4 am. Eventually I did get some sleep, until Claire woke me at 7 am. Well, waking me up wasn&#8217;t really the right choice of words. I woke up with my mouth around my cock. We made love in a strange put very passionate way for more then two hours without speaking a word. We had a shower, got dressed and took a bowl of cereal. We were wearing our normal Sunday clothes. Me in my fabulous but casual Hugo Boss suit, Claire in her favourite Fendi dress. A Sunday as there had been many before. Normally this would end up in us having lunch at Claire&#8217;s parents estate, but this time it would all be very different. We took the Jag and drove the 15 minutes route to Kim&#8217;s and Pierre&#8217;s. In fact, the mansion they lived in had been in Kim&#8217;s family for more then 150 years. Her ancestors had started a very profitable mining company in South Africa, but luck hadn&#8217;t been a part of the last generations. Kim&#8217;s parents died in a tragic plane accident over the Swiss Alpes when she was only 17 years old. She stayed in the mansion and was accompanied there by some 15 servants. A butler, a cook, even to&nbsp; a resident gardeners couple.&nbsp; All servants lived in houses that were part of the estate, but from which none you could directly see the mansion. The only one that lived in the house was the butler. And Pierre and the kids (if they were back over).

At 9:50 we turned into the long driveway and drove up to the main entrance. Claire turned to me and said: �just sit here, I&#8217;ll tell them that we have arrived�. Claire walked up to the main door and before having the chance to ring the bell, the butler Lawrence opened it. After sharing a few words, Claire returned to the car and asked me to drive it to the back entrance. There we got out and walked to the delivery entrance. We had used this entrance more then once, especially if there were large parties. The delivery entrance always held more parking space, so there was nothing strange there. Pierre opened the door within seconds after we rang. He looked a bit anxious, but otherwise he appeared his normal conservative self. He was wearing a tweed suit and even had a pair of dirty Wellingtons on. He looked like he just came back from the woods or stables. We went in. Because the environment felt so comfortable, we almost forgot what had happened the previous night. Pierre led us to the library, where the fireplace was just being lit by the butler. �Please take the rest of the day off and leave us, Lawrence� Kim said. The butler nodded and left. Kim was looking stunning. She was wearing a shiny pair of designer pants with a tight fitted white blouse. Her feet were in a pair of Prada pumps. Classy more then sexy. 
We all sat down and Pierre started to talk.
�Well, we probably need to address what happened last night�. I had no idea how to respond, and therefore I kept quiet. Claire responded right away: �Yes, we do, but how�. Kim said: �we need to be sure that anything and everything that we say from here on stays between the four of us. We need to be as open as we can, since keeping secrets from each other will only make things worse.� . �True!� we all agreed. �I&#8217;ll go first�, Kim said.

�As you know, I have been living alone in this mansion from the age of 17, until Pierre moved in. In the early days I was looking for and within myself. I did some strange things back in those days�. She looked at Pierre and he gave her a warm smile. �at some point there were 20 people, male and female staying in this house on a regular basis. We had huge parties and food and drinks were in most cases followed by enormous orgies. At the time, I thought this made me happy, but I found out, it was just me trying to get away from the pain and sorrow.� Kim turned to the side table and took a sip from her glass. It was obvious that telling her history was not easy on her. �At one point in time, I met an older man and everything in my life changed. I loved him dearly and he showed me who I really was and learned me how to get the things in life that I really wanted. What you saw yesterday is part of just that.� �I learned that I have a natural dominance that, when I give into it, makes me feel the best I can feel. You should know that this hasn&#8217;t always been easy. Since you are part of the scene too, you probably understand when I say that everyone I meet, everyone I see, I look at in a alternative way. With every contact I ask myself how it would feel to me and them if the were to submit to me.� This revelation might have been shocking in another setting, but here everyone knew exactly what Kim meant. When I had a new colleague or a new client one of the first things I would do was to look at their shoes or boots and ask myself what they would think when I got on my knees in front of them and started to kiss the shoe. Once you find out that your desire is to be submissive, it&#8217;s hard and probably not even possible to let that feeling go. �Your turn, Honey�, Kim said.

Pierre started. �The older man that Kim just mentioned, was an old friend of our family. BDSM has been a part of my life as long as I can imagine. My father was my mothers servant in all ways of life. We always knew this to be fact, but it the superiority of my mother became visible when we were old enough to understand it, and old enough to understand that this was not something we should tell our friends about. I don&#8217;t think my father has made an important decision entirely on his own after I turned 16. My mother, God rest her soul, was away on business for a large part of the year, and at these times I sometimes had long talks with my dad. We talked about how this shift in power worked out for him, and he assured me that he was the happiest man on the planet. Because it had been part of my conscious life, this was already clear to me. He convinced me that serving my mother was the most rewarding gift he had ever been given. He explained that this was not just a kink, but he knew his purpose in life was to serve. And serve he did!�. Pierre looked at Kim, and continued while staring straight into her wonderful grey eyes. �The older man was very aware of the relationship my folks had. In fact, he was somehow part of it. My dad was not the only lover of my mother. Lawrence, yes our butler, came in at least once a week to do my mom.� This turn startled me a bit. �The same Lawrence that had been your butler for as long as we are friends?� I asked. �Not our butler, my slave�� Kim replied. �You remember how I said that he learned me who I was and what I wanted out of life? He did that by introducing me to my dominant side. He showed me how gratifying it was for him to submit to me, and I found that my power over him was what I had been looking for all those years.� �He even found Pierre for me!�. 

Pierre took over: �I knew Lawrence from the scene. He was a mentor for a BDSM self help group. We were all just kids, some uncertain about what we all felt, others very aware of it. Lawrence and five other older men and women showed us the way into this life. This was a few years before Kim met him. We got together every Friday night. Sometimes we just talked for hours and hours. After we all got a bit comfortable play became a special theme. Each month all of the submissive members would prepare and serve a meal to the more dominant ones. As you can imagine, I was head chef!. This had been going on for.. What was it? 5 years?�. �I guess�, Kim replied. �And one night. There was Kim.�. �I can still recall that first moment I laid eyes on her. Shy as is was, I didn&#8217;t dare to approach her, so I asked Lawrence who she was�. �My Owner, he replied.� This might have been a shock to most people, but I knew exactly what this meant, since my dad had been in a somewhat similar situation, but not with such an age difference. I asked Lawrence how this had started, and he told me that it had been a process, with ups and downs, but the happiness that both his Owner and he received from the relationship was overwhelming.� 

�Lawrence introduced me to Kim. He went over, got on his knees, kissed Kim&#8217;s feet and said: Ma&#8217;am, may I introduce this man to You?�. 
�And that&#8217;s how it all started. To make a long story short, I moved in to this estate and I have happily served Kim ever since.�. 
�But you got married, had kids and stuff, how��, Claire kept silent when Kim raised her hand: 
�We didn&#8217;t�, she said. �Neither Pierre, nor Lawrence ever got married. They took vows all right, but not those kind. Honey, be a dear and put the cassette of your ceremony in the VCR.� 
Pierre got up, walked to what appeared to be a row of books and took a hard cover off the shell. It was a videocassette box. He took the tape out and put it into a VCD that was on the side of the room. For the next 30 minutes none of us said a word. What we saw here was everything I had ever dreamed of, and as it turned out, what Claire dreamed of too. The ceremony we witnessed was lovely, tender and very, very sincere. As it turned out, Pierre was not Pierre&#8217;s real name. This name had been given to him during the ceremony. In this ritual Kim became the Owner of Pierre&#8217;s body, mind and soul. He had dropped his former name (Simon) and would now be known as Pierre, property of his Lady Kim.

�I think it is our turn to reveal some of our secrets�, Claire said after the ending of the tape had been followed by a silence of 2 minutes (which felt like 20). 
�This kink has not always been part of our lives, as I has been for you, Pierre, or even for you Kim. We just started out with some bedroom play, and found out that both of us liked to be on the bottom of the equation. From there we took a big step. We introduced others to our life and to our bedroom. Some of them where there just because we handed them a check at the end of the night, others even became friends later on. But never, ever has the play moved into our normal day life.�
Claire took a short break, but continued in the same tone: 
�The nights of play where very nice, but never really fulfilling. I have always felt that something was missing. Sometimes I thought this had to do with our commitment to each other. There have been times where I would have been more than happy to give up my normal day life and move in with a guy or girl we met during one of our nights out.�
Claire looked at me and with tears in her eyes she said:
� I&#8217;m so sorry I never talked to you about this. These feelings were so strong, but my love for you is what kept me with you.�
I leaned over, took her hand and looked her in the eyes: 
�I know exactly what you mean. A few months ago I looked back at the past years and found something missing. I got on the internet and got into a chat with a woman who calls herself Queen. We talked about D&amp;S and during these talks I learned and found that there is such a thing as a natural, or born slave. As there is something like a natural Owner. Just as some find their calling to become a priest, at that time I found my calling.�
We were talking to each other as if there were no others in the room. But that suddenly changed when Kim took over: 
�OK, so we all know where we came from and where we are now. The question is, how do we go forward?�&nbsp; 
None of us answered, but we all just stared at Kim. 
�I have an idea. John, why don&#8217;t you and my slave go into the kitchen and prepare us all some snacks. During your work, talk a bit about how life has turned out for Pierre. And Pierre, protocol has been reissued!�. 
Pierre didn&#8217;t waste a second, dropped to his knees without standing up, crawled to Kim, kissed her feet and said: 
�Thank You, my Mistress. I would be honored to get You and Your friends a snack�. 
Without waiting for a reply, he got up, took my upper arm and led my from the sofa into the kitchen. I turned my head to take a look at Claire, and I had expected to see fear in her eyes. But this was not the case. She held her head tilted down, staring at the ground.










 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PART TWO

We went into the kitchen and just as if nothing had happened, Pierre started to make some snacks. I walked towards him, grabbed his shoulder and looked him in the eyes.
�So this is real?�, I asked him. 
�What do you mean, real?�
�You and Kim, are you serious, or are you guys just making fun of us?�
�First of all�, Pierre replied, �There is no Me and Kim. It&#8217;s my Owner Kim and me. And I think that answers your second question. I am very, very serious about this, and so is my Mistress!�
�Well, she&#8217;s not here, so please just call her Kim�.
�Whenever and wherever, I am happy to be owned by my Mistress. The day that She granted me to be Hers, has been the first day of my new life. In that life, I have had ups and downs, but every, every day I have been happy.�
��Ok, I get the point. I just never imagined that anyone could be living this life 24/7. I&#8217;ve dreamed about it, even wished for it at some point, but all the people we met were just players.�
�We have been real from the first day, and never has there been a moment in which I was equal to my Owner. I not only feel, but truly believe that I&#8217;m inferior to Her. She helped me to see this, not only by reading and learning with me, but just by being Herself.�
�So if I get this,&nbsp; you both believe that there are people who are superior and those who are inferior, and that in a day to day life?�
�Yeah, but you know that too. This is not as uncommon as it might seem. The Caste system in India for instance. But closer to home, when someone tries to shoot the President, a bodyguard will try to catch the bullet. Even if it will cost him his life. This shows that some lives are worth more then others. If you see this as a fact, then my submission to my Mistress is not so strange.�
This was a way of looking at things that was completely new to me. Of course I had tried to get into subspace more then once, but to live in it, and to believe it to be your purpose�
�This might be a bit bald to ask, but how would you feel about serving the snacks when we get in?� Pierre asked.
�No problem there� I replied.
�Ok. Just one more request. I think my Mistress would be very happy with me, if She would find out that I convinced you to serve it, while kneeling in front of Her.�
And just like that I said: �It would be my honour!� 
As to this day I have no idea where that answer came from. Was it lust for the kink of it, the desire to serve or just some sort of intervention that brought me back to my Path.

Pierre knocked on the door of the library and opened it just after Kim gave us permission. I walked in, with my eyes facing the floor, and walked straight towards the chair that Kim was in. I kneeled and said: �Kim, dear friend. Your slave has made these snacks for Your pleasure. Please accept from my hands.�
I looked up into the eyes of Kim. �Face Down!� She said. And I did as I was told.
�You almost ruined a very special moment. One of the rules in this house is that eye contact with me is only permitted during a one-on-one talk or if protocol has been lifted. This is a rule that applies to all submissives that are in the same room as I am. Now John, if you understand what I just said, just say: Yes Ma&#8217;am.�
�Yes, Ma&#8217;am�, I replied in a whispering voice.
�I didn&#8217;t hear you�. 
�YES, MA&#8217;AM� I shouted.
Smack. She slapped me in the face. One of the snacks fell of the plate I was holding. 
�Never, ever use such a tone with me. This can all be over in less then a minute if you keep doing things this way!�. 
�I&#8217;m sorry Ma&#8217;am�, I said. I was worried about the slap in the face by one of my best friends, but at that moment I was more concerned about dissatisfying Kim then anything else. 
�It&#8217;s ok. This is all new for you, but you have to see right away that protocol is very important. Inappropriate behaviour, will lead to uncertainty about who you are and who I am.�
�I think I understand, Ma&#8217;am�.
�Very well. Now stand up, put the plate on the side table, and sit yourself down on the sofa. We need to continue our conversation, and protocol will need to be released for a while�.
I got up, walked to the side table, put the plate down, walked back to the sofa and sat down. Just like I had been ordered to do. When I sat I noticed Claire was not in the room. 
�Pierre, I&#8217;m very happy about what you did with the time I gave you with John.� Kim said.
�Thank You, my Mistress�
�Now, let&#8217;s continue where we left off. To make things a bit more easy, I would like you John to still address me as Ma&#8217;am. The transfer from protocol to no-protocol might be a bit too much for you.�
�Yes, Ma&#8217;am�, I said.
�Very well. A fast learner. I like that.�
�Just one question Ma&#8217;am, where is Claire�.
�Don&#8217;t worry. Claire is not doing anything she doesn&#8217;t want to do. I&#8217;ve had the same talk with her, that Pierre had with you, I guess. Claire herself has requested her current assignment.�
Without knowing what Kim meant by that, I nodded.

�I would like to give you a gift�, Kim started. �A gift that comes close to all the things that you have always wanted and that seemed to be out of reach. I would like to give you the opportunity to feel what life would be like if you were a true slave.�
�Wow�,&nbsp; I said. �That&#8217;s a bit fast. Only yesterday we found out that you share some of our interest, and today I would become a slave?�
�Oh no� Kim answered. �No way I would accept someone that fast. No, I would like to give you the opportunity to serve me, the rest of the week, as if you were my slave!�
�And what does that mean?�
�Don&#8217;t worry about the details. If what you told me earlier about your dreams and desires is true, you will just have a great week. If not, then the week would be over in a week, and life will continue as it was.No stings, just an experience added.�
�Sounds tempting, but I feel that our friendship might break if this doesn&#8217;t work out.�
�Our friendship is already over. You kneeled in front of me. Every time I would see you, or if you would see me, this image would come back. I&#8217;m giving you the chance to stop fearing this image, but to embrace it as a precious memory.�
�Ma&#8217;am, Claire and I never played alone. If I were to do this, I would have to talk to Claire about it first.�
�Well, Claire didn&#8217;t feel the same way!�
�What do you mean?� I asked.
�I gave her the same proposal, and you want to know how she replied?�
�How� What did she say?�
�Let&#8217;s ask her!� Kim said. 
Kim picked up a small bell and rang it. A few seconds later, the door opened. There was Claire. Completely naked. She walked towards Kim, got on her knees. Kissed her feet and said �You rang, Ma&#8217;am? How may I serve You?�
�You just did� Kim said. �Get your forehead on the floor and continue to kiss my feet�.
�Well, John. As you see, Claire here took the gift I gave her without hesitation and she took it with both hands. I don&#8217;t think you will need her approval!�.
�Ma&#8217;am, may I please ask Claire a question?� I asked. Kim nodded.
�Claire, honey. Are you sure this is what you want and what you would want me to do too?�
�John, my love. I&#8217;m not sure this is what I want, but I&#8217;m very sure that I would like to find that out. Kim has given us an opportunity to experience something that playing will never come close to. I feel this is something we should do�.
�Ma&#8217;am, please promise me that you will not hurt us, hurt our feelings or do something that will leave permanent scars?� I asked.
�John,� Kim started to talk in a comforting tone. �You still don&#8217;t understand. I&#8217;ll do everything in your best interest, but this will not be easy. Your submission will not be without a reward. I&#8217;m even pretty sure that after this first week you both will beg me to continue in my service. This has been the case with many before you. As to pain and scars. I&#8217;m not a sadist. If I punish my slaves, the purpose of that punishment is to help them grow, not to hurt them. Pain and scars might be involved, but only as a tool, not as the goal.�

Kim stood up. She put her hand through Claire&#8217;s hair in an almost erotic way. She pulled Claire&#8217;s head so her face was facing her. She got down and kissed Claire on the mouth. It was a tender kiss and Claire wanted to answer it in a steaming way, but just before she did that, Kim pulled her head back to the ground.
�John, if you still have doubts, please leave now. If not, try to show me the respect I deserve.� Kim said.
�Ma&#8217;am, I&#8217;m not sure I know what You mean by showing you respect�. I said.
�Well, let&#8217;s start by getting clear first that we&#8217;ll try this for the rest of the week. All clear with that?�
�Yes please Ma&#8217;am� Claire replied.
�Ma&#8217;am,� I said. �My doubts have gone. I will try to do my best and will submit to You for the rest of this week.�
�I&#8217;m glad about that! Be sure that my guidance this week will be strict. This is the only way to get you both in a state where you will feel what it is like to be a slave. One week is a very short period. Therefore you will not question any of my commands. At the end of each day, we&#8217;ll have a short talk during which protocol will be lifted. Each day you will learn 5 new rules. These rules will apply from the moment you have learned them, and should be followed during your stay here. Since we have started now, the first rule will be applied right away. John, get of the sofa. Furniture is not to be used by slaves.�
I got up and stood there, not sure what was expected of me next.
�The second rule, since this seem to not come naturally, In my presence you will never just stand in a room. If you are performing your duties, and I walk in, you will drop your head to your chest and stare at the ground. If you enter a room which I am in, you will make sure that the level of your eyes is below mine. If you need to kneel down to make that happen, kneel down. Do you both understand these rules?� 
�Yes Ma&#8217;am� we said, and I got down on my knees, pretty sure that was the response Kim wanted.
�Very good!� Kim showed a little grin.
�I would like you both to go to the cellar. There we have a �guest quarter�. Pierre will accompany you. He has been given instructions. You will change in to the clothes I have picked out for you both. You will love them, I&#8217;m sure!. Now go!� Kim turned away not looking at us anymore. She walked to the side table, grabbed a snack and started eating it. Pierre got up first. He tapped Claire on the back, and she got up. I followed them right away.

Without saying a word, we both followed Pierre down the stairs into the cellar. We probably expected a dungeon, but the guest quarters were just that: Guest quarters. Well, the room had a double bed, a blanket next to each side of the bed and two chains that were attached to the head of the bed. On the bed there were two outfits. It was pretty obvious that Kim knew what she wanted. There was nothing kinky about these clothes. Rags is the best way to describe them. I looked at Claire to find her undressing already. She was pretty determined to follow each and every command that had been given to her. She stepped into the blue see-through dress. Pierre helped her to button up the back. 
�I&#8217;m sure my Mistress would like to get rid of those too� he said while pointing at her knickers. And without hesitation, Claire took her panties off. 
�Yours is a bit more complicated, John.� Pierre said.
�First of all, you will need to get completely naked. Then we need to lock the chastity device. My Mistress is very keen on keeping men locked in, when She doesn&#8217;t need us.�
I had always fantasised about being locked in a chastity device. During play parties I sometimes wore a CB, so this was not new for me. I did as Pierre instructed me. 
�Claire, my Mistress has asked me to ask you to lock John&#8217;s device. You will hand Her the key when we return to Her.�
Claire stepped toward me, locked me in and kept the key between her fingers. She looked me in the eyes and asked: �We are sure about this, right?�
�For now, I sure am!� I said. And gave her a smile, which she returned with a kiss on my mouth.
I got into the rest of the clothes. They were black linen pants, and a black top. They weren&#8217;t the kinkiest clothes I had worn, but they felt and looked a bit like what a black slave would have worn in the South of America. 
�You guys are both almost ready� Pierre said. He got over to a cupboard in the room, opened it and took two pairs of leather arm bracelets. He walked towards us and put the bracelets on. They both had a metal ring attached to them. 
�You will be wearing these bracelets until the day that you leave her. You will not be wearing a collar. My Mistress doesn&#8217;t like the way they look on a day to day basis. Collars will be used, but you will not be wearing them 24/7. I myself have a sign of my owner that I will wear 24/7, for the rest of my life.� 
Pierre opened his shirt and showed us a tattoo that said: Lot 2, owned by MK. He buttoned his shirt up and said: �Let&#8217;s not keep Her waiting. When we enter the room, you should both get to one side of the side table, kneel there and just wait until you receive your next order. Keep your eyes facing the ground.�

PART THREE

As we went up the stairs Claire walked just in front of me. Her legs were very visible through her dress. her panty less bottom was always stunning, but to see them in clothes, or better through clothes, that had been picked by the woman who would be our dominant for this week just added a special something to the look. We walked through the corridor until we reached the library. Pierre told us to wait for a second, so he could see if Kim was still in. This would mean that our entrance should have been even more formal. Since Kim was not in, we were guided in by Pierre. He was very calm and led us to the right place.
�My Mistress would like to see a position in which you show devotion to Her. For this we have the �What is Your Will� position. You kneel down, keep your legs spread a bit and rest your open hands on your knees. Claire, in your left hand, you will hold the key to John&#8217;s CB. Now let&#8217;s get on with it�. 
Claire and I both went to our own side of the side table. I had been on my knees in many a kinky game before, and I might even say that endurance on my knees is no issue. Claire had a bit more difficulty getting into the right position. Again, Pierre was very helpful. There was even a mall giggle when Claire dropped the key. Pierre helped her with it, and in less then one minute we were in the right position. Pierre walked over to the sofa, and kneeled down just next to it. There we all were. Kneeling and in anticipation.

Nearly 10 minutes passed. In this period my breathing started to become very calm. We were all so quiet that the steppes we heard in the corridor sounded even more frightening. And still we all kept very quiet. The door went open and Kim stepped in. She closed the door and walked to the sofa. She poured a glass of wine, picked up a book and started&nbsp; to read. Just keeping us just as we were. 10 more minutes must have passed until Kim spoke. 
�Pierre, you did me proud�.
�Thank You, Mistress� 
�Have they been any trouble in their quarters?�
�No, Mistress. They have been very easy going. They seem to be very serious about this.�
�I sure hope so. My time is very, very precious, and you know how mad I can get if it gets spoiled!�
�Yes, Mistress. I do know and I do understand. The female has a gift for You�.
Pierre had not called Claire by her name, but started to refer to her as �the female�.
�Oh my. A gift for me on her first evening! Approach female!� 
She called out her command without even looking in our direction. Claire closed the palm of her hand, making sure she would not drop the key, and was just about to stand up when Kim said: �Since you are already on your knees, use your hands too and crawl to me!� 
I&#8217;m still not sure how Kim could have seen that Claire intended to stand up. Claire did as she was told and crawled to Kim, still with one hand closed and holding the key with a firm grip. 
Claire got in front of Kim, laid her forehead on the ground, lifted her hand, as good as possible and said: �Ma&#8217;am, please accept my husbands chastity as a gift to You.�
�Ohhh, that&#8217;s nice, isn&#8217;t is? What did you think. That either of your sexual needs would be in your own hands? This key is a nice gesture, but really, who do you think is in control?� 
Neither of us said a word, not sure what the right answer should have been. 
�Get here, both of you!� 
I crawled towards Kim and kneeled next to Claire, and just before I lowered my head Kim said: �High Kneel�.
Claire reacted a bit slower then I did, but within a split second we were both in a high kneel position, with our heads just below Kim&#8217;s. SMACK, SMACK. We both got a slap in the face.
�This is the first and only time I will say this: If I ask you a question and you do not answer, this to me is a sign of disrespect. I do not expect all your answers to be the right ones, and you will be punished if needed, but to not answer at all is no option. In case you do not understand a question you can say just that. But don&#8217;t go thinking about what would be the appropriate response. You will not get in my head, and therefore you will never be able to know the exact right answer. But always make sure that you answer is sincere!� Kim&#8217;s reprimand started in a angry voice, but worked it&#8217;s way to a learning, almost motherly tone.
�Now, let me have the key. Thank you slave. The third rule I just learned you will be followed by a very important fourth. Keep this in mind: My time is not your time. For that matter, there is no such thing as your time. If you are in my presence, don&#8217;t feel that you deserve any attention, or any of my time. If you have just prepared something for me and you hope that I will show my appreciation, don&#8217;t expect anything. You can and you may hope for it, but don&#8217;t expect it. Do you both understand this rule?�
�Yes, Ma&#8217;am� we both said.

Kim got up, walked out of the room, just keeping us where we were. None of us moved. We were all sure that after that last explanation we were not supposed to. After a few minutes, Pierre got up. He walked towards us and said:
�My Mistress has ordered me to accompany you both to the salon. We had to wait two minutes after She had left. So please get up and follow me.� We did as we were told and followed Pierre through the hallway, into the salon. We had been here many times before, but never had it looked like it did now. All the furniture (but one chair) had been moved to the side of the room and in the center there was a wooden construction with two chains attached to them. At the end of the chains there were heavy looking metal collars. 
�Help each other into these collars and if you are done, rest your back against the pole in the center of the structure. Each of you should be on a different side, with only the pole between your backs. Oh, I almost forgot. Strip naked first! And be quick about it, because my Mistress will arrive shortly.�
Claire and I looked at each other, but before we could start to talk, Claire started to undress. I followed. Without saying anything I locked the collar around her neck. She returned the favor. We got in position and waited, not sure what this structure would be used for. We stood there for more then five minutes, when we heard the clicking of heels on the marble in the hallway. Because the rest of the house was so quiet, this was the only thing we heard at that time. As the sound got neared, my tension got higher. What was in store for us. I was pretty sure we pleased Kim as well as could have been expected this first day, but I couldn&#8217;t be sure. 

The door opened. I looked and there was Kim. She wore a black latex evening gown, matching black opera gloves and laced up boots with a high heel. She could have stepped out of a fetish catalogue. I guess my appreciation was visible because Kim said: 
�Male, close your mouth and your eyes as well! And for god sake, stand still you both�
She waited a few seconds and then she continued to walk towards the one seat that had not been moved to the side. We could hear the sound of the latex as she sat down. A few seconds later, the door opened again and, as it turned out later, Pierre entered, went over to his Mistress and kneeled beside her.
Kim spoke:
�In a few seconds I will ask you to open your eyes and look at me. But before that I want you to know why you will be granted that privilege. I have loved you as friends for as long as I can remember. The change that occurred today has had an impact on me too. You need to know that, although I&#8217;m delighted that you have agreed to this, it is not easy for me. As your dominant I need to make sure that you will not be harmed in any way. As you are old friends of mine, this is even harder. I know I will need to discipline you both, and pain will be involved, but I see and feel that I&#8217;m a bit hesitant to do this. The exercise we are about to start is not only for your growth and my pleasure, but also for me to get over a threshold. If you understand what I mean, open your eyes and look at me�.
I knew exactly what Kim meant. To get punishment, even in an erotic way, from a stranger for me was always more easy then from some one I had a bond with. Therefore I opened my eyes, turned my head&nbsp; and could feel that Claire did the same.
�May I speak, Ma&#8217;am�, Claire said.
�Yes, you may, and speak freely�
�I think I understand what you mean, but to speak for myself, I totally trust you, since you have been my friend for so long. I know everything has changed, but I&#8217;m more then willing to forget our past as friends and to start focusing on serving you as you deserve to be served. If you decide to inflict pain during my growth, I will cherish this pain as I know it will have hurt you too. I hope that soon your pain will have gone, and the punishment is just that. Even if you decide to inflict pain for your own amusement, the reward for me will be that my body and my pain have been instruments to please you. This is what I want, and this is what I choose to be, with a free and open mind.�
We all were quiet for a while and I guess we were all moved by her confession. 
�Well, I&#8217;m very happy that you feel that way� Kim said. �Is that something you can relate to?� She asked me.
�I wouldn&#8217;t say that the determination that Claire just showed can be matched by myself at this time, but I am sure that we made the right decision, what ever the outcome may be. Pain has never been part of my kink. I&#8217;m just not a masochist. I know that pain is a way to please, but if I can avoid punishment by groveling deeper and serving better, that would be my path.�
Kim got up, walked around us and with her gloved hands she took my nipples and gave them a quick pull.
�Both your answers have pleased me�. She leaned over and dropped a small but tender kiss on my forehead. She walked around to Claire and kissed her long and wet on the mouth. If I could have focused more, I probably would have smelled the wetness of Claires pussy already as she started to squirm a bit. Kim walked around again, ordered me to open my mouth and two wet gloved fingers entered my mouth. My wife juices went from her pussy to my mouth, through Kim&#8217;s gloves.
Kim stepped back, leaving my mouth wanting for more. 
She started to talk in a soothing voice. �This structure you are now in, will be known to you as the shame block. I use this only to punish those who refuse to listen. Besides during an initiation like this, I have not used the shame block for the last 18 months. The last time I used it was to punish Pierre for cumming in a girl I had him fuck. If you are good, this will be the only time you are here. And to make sure that you will remember to follow my commands, during the initiation I always perform this exercise. It will hurt. Pierre, my instruments!�
Pierre got up and walked to a black satin coffin in the corner of the room. He opened the coffin and took two leather blindfolds out of them. 
�During formal punishment you will never see me. Since punishment is also a form of attention, that you at that time do not deserve, the privilege of looking at me at that time is withdrawn. Pierre, blindfold them!� 
�Yes, my Mistress� said Pierre as he put the blindfolds over our heads.�
�You will be gagged as well. You should be in contact with your pain and focus on that what you did to displease me in such a way that you deserve the punishment. During that time, the physical ability to speak has to be limited. Pierre, apply the gags, and take this key and unlock the CB!�
�Yes, my Mistress�&nbsp; Pierre answered and a few seconds later a large gag was in my mouth and my penis was liberated from its enclosure. 
�Pierre, leave�&nbsp; We could hear Pierre leave the room.

I could hear Kim walking around us. At first the circles were very large, but with every turn, she came in a bit closer. Her breathing was steady, but audible. At this moment the anticipation of what was in store for us, was greater then I could have imagined. I felt truly scared, and this showed off. Kim grabbed my chin and lifted my head up. She moved very close to my ear and whispered:
�what you want and what you fear doesn&#8217;t matter at this moment, do you understand?� 
I tried to nod to make sure that Kim got my answer, but her grip on my chin was pretty firm. 
�I think you do.� She whispered again. �I will detach the collar around your neck. I want you to show how much you want to take that which I am giving you. If you cannot or will not take it, you can walk away right now. If not, you will take this punishment with pride and thank me for it later.�
She unlocked the collar and stepped back a few feet. All sorts of things went through my head, but leaving was not one if them. In something that I can only describe as a natural reflex, I kneeled down, dropped my head to my chest, and moved my arms to my back. This sign of submission felt very natural and even confused myself a bit. Kim must have loved it, because she tapped me on the head as she moved to Claire.
�Claire, I will detach your collar too. If you are not completely sure that I know what you need right now, and if you are unwilling or unable to comply and to take this punishment, you can leave right now. If not, you will thank me for my attention and your punishment after it is over.� 
Without asking her if she understood this, Kim unlocked the collar and left Claire standing there, free to make a decision. Claire too dropped to her knees and got into the �what is your will� position. Kim was even more satisfied with her reaction, because she kissed Claire on the head.
�Never before have I performed this ritual without having to beat the subject. This test of obedience was necessary, to make sure you are both sincere. There will be pain, but not tonight. I want you to remove your gags and blindfolds and crawl to that chair.� She walked to the chair and sat down.

The intensity of what had just happened hit me. Without a clear other reason I started to cry. I had been so afraid of the pain I was to endure, that the withholding of that pain hit me even greater then the pain could have. With tears in eyes I removed the gag and the blindfold and crawled towards Kim. Claire and I were both just inches away from the boots of our old friend when she started to talk again:
�As you have learned just now, it&#8217;s no longer up to you to decide what you do or feel. The expectation of pain is sometimes greater then the pain itself. Rule number four is: Expect to be disciplined and punished, but never want it.� 
Kim moved a bit towards us, lifted our hands with her hands and looked us in the eyes, mine still wet with tears. 
�As to the last rule of this day. This rule is not to define a certain protocol, but to define who you are while you are here. Make sure that you remember this rule, as it will be part of tomorrows training. Say the raule up loud to make it your own mantra. This is the rule: your purpose is simple. your are to further your growth as directed and be pleasing to Me at all times. Complete obedience is natural and expected, and your main goal is to function as an extension of My will and body, serving in whatever ways I desire.�
Kim repeated the rule two times, to make sure we got it. 
�Pierre will pick you up form the hallway shortly to take you to your quarters. You will take a luke warm shower and sleep on the blankets next to the bed. You will not talk to each other. There is a small alarmclock in the room. Tomorrow at six you will get up. You both know the way around the house, so I don&#8217;t have to explain anything there. you (Kim looked at me) will start to tidy this room. And you will start to make breakfast. I feel like croissants with honey. At 7:30 sharp you will both be outside the master bedroom, on your knees, dressed in the clothes you got earlier. You will hold the plate and wait until Pierre will guide you in.�
Kim got up, but just before she walked away, she said: �From this moment on, until the day you decide to leave or I send you away, you will call me Mistress. If you think of me, think not of me as Kim. For you Kim no longer exists. Do you understand?�
�Yes Mistress� we both said. 
�All right then. From this moment on, you John will be known as aydo. This is your temporary slave name. Your temp name, Claire, is aya. These names are not really names, but describe the position in my society you now hold. It means Servant and Female Servant. Since your relation towards each other is now less important then your relation to me, you will call each other brother and sister. Now leave�.
We left and as Mistress had said, Pierre came to the hallway not a second later. 
�brother, sister�, he said �follow me to your quarters. They now are your servants quarters and no longer the guest quarters.� As we went into the our quarters we didn&#8217;t say a word. 
�To honor my Mistress, please call me brother too� Pierre said. 
�brother!� we both said.
After taking our short shower we fell to sleep in just a few minutes.
