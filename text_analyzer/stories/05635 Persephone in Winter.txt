������������������������������� Prologue

&nbsp;

Elyse waited patiently by the open trunk of the car as
the boy placed

the last bag of groceries inside. She found herself
smiling, for no

particular reason.�
The sun was warm on her face, and a slight breeze

played with her hair, tickling her cheek, teasing her in
and out of her

daydream.

&nbsp;

The soft knit of the light sweater fell away from the
firm swell of her

breasts as she reached to close the trunk lid, then
settled smoothly

over them again as she turned to the boy to tip him.� She caught him

staring and blushed, almost having forgotten how a boy
might be

distracted by the slight sway of a woman's bare breasts
and nipples

beneath the ordinary white turtleneck.

&nbsp;

Looking over the boy's shoulder, her smile widened, and
she waved.

Steven had disappeared at the last minute, and now came
bounding across

the parking lot clutching a small bouquet of wildflowers.

&nbsp;

&quot;For you, my lady,&quot; he announced as he bowed,
raising the offering as

though she was royalty.�
&quot;You!&quot; she said, giggling.

&nbsp;

The boy watched them play.� He saw the sparkle of happiness in her eyes,

and the kiss that Steven planted on her lips, then turned
away to give

them their privacy.�
There would be a day in his future as well, he

thought as he walked back to his eight hour shift, a day
when he would

see the same sparkle in the eyes of the perfect girl, the
girl of his

dreams.

&nbsp;

They drove with the top down.� The immaculately restored Triumph

convertible took each turn as if it had just come off the
production

line, hugging the road with familiar security as they
left the highway

behind, traveling the winding lane that led them home.

&nbsp;

Elyse stretched her arms upward, the fall air rushing
through the

spaces between spread fingers.� Weeks ago the leaves had changed from

summer green to blazing yellows and reds.� Now a fresh layer of red and

brown covered the roadside as the last of the forest
harvest fluttered

reluctantly to earth.

&nbsp;

Steven glanced at her as he drove, smiling at her playful
gesture.� He

could see where the sweater revealed the soft skin of her
belly as she

stretched, and the shape of her breasts and nipples under
the white

knit.

&nbsp;

&quot;I've never seen you leave the house like
that,&quot; Steven said, breaking

a long silence.�
Elyse grinned at him with satisfaction and stretched

higher, relieved that he had finally noticed.

&nbsp;

&quot;I thought you might like it,&quot; she said, her
face now tilted upward

into the wind.

&nbsp;

&quot;I'm sure the boy at the market liked it,&quot; he
answered with a hint of

irritation.

&nbsp;

&quot;Mmmm, I didn't think about that.� I suppose it's harmless enough.� I

doubt that I've corrupted him for life.&quot;� She laughed and turned to look

at him.� As she
lowered her arms, a falling leaf met her outstretched

hand and tangled itself in her fingers.

&nbsp;

He kept his eyes on the road ahead, refusing to return
her look.� &quot;What

I'd really like is that my wife not expose her breasts to
every

teenager in town.&quot;

&nbsp;

Suddenly the joy of the crisp air and fall colors was
drained from her.

She sat next to him, hands in her lap, shocked into
silence.� &quot;I - I did

it for you...&quot; she said quietly.� She stared at the leaf, turning it

over and over in her lap.�
It was perfectly shaped, but brittle and

brown, without color or life.

&nbsp;

Hidden away in the woods at the end of a gravel lane, the
sprawling

house's presence was surprisingly overwhelming to anyone
who might come

upon it by chance.�
A wedding present from Elyse's father, the summer

&quot;cabin&quot; as he called it had belonged to his
father as well.� Though

made of large logs taken generations ago from deep within
the same

forest, its sheer size and modern interior made it
anything but the

diminutive description her father was so fond of.

&nbsp;

&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; Steven said as he turned the key
and the car's engine

died.� &quot;I love
the way you look; I love everything about you.�
You know

that.� It's just
that I don't want everyone in town staring at your

body.� I know you
did it for me, but it's a small town.�
Someone may take

it the wrong way.�
If everyone thinks you're flirting, well, who knows

what might happen?�
It's embarrassing.&quot;

&nbsp;

Elyse stared at the leaf, now turned to hard branching
veins as its

petrified flesh crumbled into her lap.� &quot;I know,&quot; she told him.� &quot;It was

silly - I just didn't think about the consequences.� I'm sorry.&quot;

&nbsp;

Steven leaned over and kissed her.� &quot;Don't be sorry.� Besides, you can

show me your nipples, at home, any time, in fact, all the
time, if you

want.&quot;� He
grinned, hoping to get the same response from her.

&nbsp;

She did her best to show him the grin he wanted.� As she returned his

kiss, she felt his hand on her breast, his fingers
teasing her nipple

beneath the thin knit sweater.� She kissed him harder, the sounds of the

woods bringing her alive again, making her wet for him
then and there.

His belt opened easily, and in seconds her hand closed
around his

erection, stroking it, pulling it free into the
wilderness she loved.

&nbsp;

&quot;Not here,&quot; he said finally.� &quot;Let's go inside.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Here,&quot; she moaned, as she lowered her face to
his lap, reaching for

the hard tip of his sex with her tongue.

&nbsp;

&quot;Elyse,&quot; he said abruptly.� &quot;What's gotten into you today?� What if

someone should come by?&quot;� She took an inch of him, then another, into

her mouth. She knew he wouldn't resist; she was sure he
couldn't, once

she began to move her lips and tongue over him.� When he cradled her

head in his hands, she melted inside, and closed her
mouth even more

tightly around him.�
&quot;Please,&quot; she thought, &quot;show me, show me what you

want me to do to you, show me how you want me to suck
you, how you want

to fuck my mouth, oh god, please show me...&quot;� But he pulled her face

away from his lap, her soft hair tangled in his fingers,
her eyes

pleading for something he didn't understand.

&nbsp;

&quot;Inside,&quot; he whispered.� They sat, trembling, staring into each others

eyes.� Elyse
nodded, and, with a smile Steven didn't recognize as one of

consolation, felt his hands slip from her hair.� The air had taken on a

sudden chill as she helped carry the groceries to the
house.� Winter was

coming.� If only
she had worn her jacket.

&nbsp;

That evening Elyse sat curled up in a big overstuffed
recliner by the

fire, her nose buried in a book.� Her robe had worked its way open,

revealing a delicious, smooth expanse of thigh, as well
as the deep V

between her breasts.�
Steven sat across from her on the sofa, his papers

scattered over the wide, rustic coffee table. Now and
then she glanced

up at him, checking to see whether he noticed each time
she shifted

positions, letting her robe open another inch.

&nbsp;

&quot;Damn it!&quot; he muttered.� &quot;Where in the hell - Elyse, have you
seen part

of my manuscript?�
A loose page maybe?� Something
with a lot of

calculations on it?&quot;�
He still hadn't looked at her.

&nbsp;

She knew how important his paper was to his future - at
least she

thought she understood.�
His explanation was always a little cryptic to

her, all that math and those strange symbols.� She did understand that a

college professor would always be just a college
professor if he didn't

distinguish himself in his field.� Publish or perish.� She had heard him

say it so many times, as though she might have somehow
forgotten the

clich�.

&nbsp;

&quot;You're tired,&quot; she told him, her voice as
silky and inviting as she

could make it.�
&quot;Why don't you come to bed? We'll look tomorrow.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;But it was just here!&quot; he insisted.� &quot;Maybe I left it in my
office.&quot;� He

rose and left the room, never glancing at her open
robe.� &quot;For Christ

sake!� Damn it,
damn it, damn it!&quot;� His curses
echoed from the open

doorway down the hall.

&nbsp;

Elyse sighed, put her book on the floor beside the chair,
gathered her

robe around her, and went to help.� She stood at his office door,

listening to him rant and watching him tear though stacks
of papers.

&quot;It must be here!�
It has to be!&quot;� He still
hadn't looked at her.

&nbsp;

&quot;I'm going to bed,&quot; she told him finally.� &quot;You coming?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Soon,&quot; he told her, finally looking up at
her.� She had let her robe

fall open again.�
She was naked under it, and smiled when she saw him

staring at her body.�
Steven paused and sighed, as though he was annoyed

at being caught ogling her.� &quot;I'll be up soon,&quot; he said evenly,
still

shuffling through a chaos of white paper.

&nbsp;

An hour had passed before he woke her from a light sleep
as he slipped

into bed beside her.�
She felt his hand cup her breast, then move slowly

down her belly, finally probing between her legs.� Pushing away the numb

calm of an hour's sleep, she turned toward him and placed
her hand

along the side of his face.� Another minute, and he would kiss her, then

move closer, working his hips forward tentatively, as if
asking

permission to enter her.�
She would find his penis and hold him, playing

with him lightly, coaxing him nearer, assuring him with
her pounding

heart and loving touches that she wanted him inside her.

&nbsp;

He made love to her with tenderness and precision.� She knew every move

so well.� He would
wait hours for her to cum.� On the rare
occasion when

an orgasm eluded her, times when merely enjoying the
closeness of being

one with him was enough, he seemed relentless.� It shamed her to think

of the times she had pretended, offering up a quiet sigh
of a climax so

he could finally enjoy his own release.

&nbsp;

She stroked his chest and shoulders as he worked, his
erection reliable

and tireless, pushing into her with machine-like
predictability.� He

would lean closer to nibble on her neck soon, then find
her ear with

the tip of his tongue.�
So loving.� So caring.� So careful.

&nbsp;

Elyse studied his face until his eyes closed.� Concentrating, she

thought.� Trying to
please me.� Trying to make me cum.� As time passed,

she stared past Steven, into the darkness of their
bedroom.� He loves

me.� He loves
me.� He loves me.� She would make the practiced sigh, tense

her body, then give up a crescendo of moans, her sign to
him that he

had satisfied her, and all was right with the world.� Elyse wondered if 

he counted her moans, analyzed them with the precision of
the mathematics

that had become his life.

&nbsp;

He loves me.� He
loves me.� He loves me.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It wasn't quite as though she was cheating.� He had known for some

time.� And she knew
he knew.� She couldn't help crying out a
bit louder

when she came.� She
had always been quiet, her small throaty moan

rising on those few special occasions when she seemed
especially wet.

&nbsp;

Now she came with mouth wide open, filling the darkened
bedroom with

unfamiliar words, telling him over and over how she
wanted him, how she

loved his cock inside her.� When she straddled him and played with her

breasts, or rose on her knees offering him entry from
behind, he knew

another man took her that way.� Yet, they went on, week after week,

knowing but not admitting, too fearful to let the words
pass between

them.

&nbsp;

She was the first to break the silence.

&nbsp;

&quot;I have to tell you about him.&quot;

&nbsp;

He couldn't look at her.�
He wouldn't.

&nbsp;

She watched him look away, then glanced at the phone.

&nbsp;

&quot;I don't love him.�
I just can't say no to him.&quot;

&nbsp;

His spine turned to stone at her words.� His hands trembled, breath

coming in thin packets that racked his chest.

&nbsp;

&quot;I want to stop.�
But when he wants me - &quot;

&nbsp;

Steven jumped when the phone rang.� His eyes went to it, then to Elyse.

She ignored the insistent warble, now pale and oddly neutral
as she

searched for his reaction.

&nbsp;

She was slim and fragile in the cotton sundress.� Enough light poured

through it from behind her to reveal the outline of her
breasts and

waist.� He guessed
she was naked beneath it, then was sure of it as

she approached the phone.�
She pressed it to her ear, listening,

motionless, familiar lines of bare thigh revealed through
the

translucent cotton.

&nbsp;

Elyse held the receiver out to him, knowing he would take
it.

&nbsp;

He listened, still frozen in place, while the voice
delivered options

and ultimatums.

&nbsp;

&quot;She still loves you, you know.� She comes to me for something else, a

sense of possession, an unresolved sensual necessity. You
can choose

to allow her this, or flee, freeing yourself of the pain
and her love.

The decision is yours.&quot;

&nbsp;

The voice was precise and confident.� He could see she knew it well.

Her eyes were wide with anticipation and excitement.� The voice told

him everything, what was, and what was to be.� And Steven knew that a

part of her already belonged to the voice, but not the
part that loved

him. Could he share her flesh to keep her shining eyes?

&nbsp;

&quot;Your decision is one that's easier to agree to than
to live with.� But

then, agreeing is only the first step, is it not?� Can you take the

second?� Only time
will tell. And time is growing short.�
So, to test

your stride, the second step, if you're up to it.� Simon says ...&quot;

&nbsp;

At sundown, Steven followed his wife into the warm rain
of the shower.

Elyse offered herself to him, head back, erect nipples
waiting for the

soap in his hand against them, then down her belly,
smooth slippery

skin made fresh for her late-night lover.� Her thighs tightened at his

touch as a soapy river raced over them, swirling into the
drain below.

She turned her back to him, and he studied the lines and
valleys of her

shoulders, filled now with frothy white as he passed the
soapy cloth

over them.�
Finally, gliding down the deep crevice of her back, his

hands now free of everything except the scented soap, he
cupped and

lifted the soft but firm globes of her ass, circling over
them, feeling

the weight of them in his hands.� Her legs opened.� She leaned against

the shower wall, her open slit reminding him of his duty.

&nbsp;

Simon says...

&nbsp;

The soap made her slick and wet between her legs.� Had it been that way

before he touched her there?� Did her back arch a little when his soapy

fingers drifted into the space between fleshy cunt-lips?

&nbsp;

After a quiet moan, her words - bitter, breathless,
agonizing.

&nbsp;

&quot;Will you give me to him?� Will you clean me, dress me, take me to him?

Will you love me after I take another man inside me and
cum,

screaming under him, knowing I love you more each
day?&quot;

&nbsp;

His answer was not with words, but with actions.� He dried her with the

large towel, careful not to dwell where more questions
would come.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The house was one of many hidden behind dense hedges and
wide iron

gates along the endless avenue. Finding it was painfully
slow. The

camera's cold, glass eye found them, internal elements
shifting with

precision, then stared unblinking at them through the
windshield for

what seemed like hours.

&nbsp;

At first they sat in silence in the waiting car - her
heart racing with

forbidden surrender to another, his with apprehension,
and finally

terror. She was delicious in the cool evening light. He
had never

seen her so radiant - the creamy white skin of her neck
gracefully

arched over a tempting hint of heaving breast revealed at
the border of

the modest neckline.

&nbsp;

The dress was delivered earlier that day, a plain black
box with a

single red rose attached.�
Steven was curious but quiet upon its

arrival. She placed it on the bed unopened, smiled, and
put her arms

around his waist.

&nbsp;

&quot;He always dresses me.� Oh, it's not what you think.� No garter belts

or lingerie, none of that.� He puts me in the most tasteful clothes,

something different each time.� Very chic.�
Very expensive.� Afterwards

he takes them from me and destroys them.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;He thinks that little of you?&quot;

&nbsp;

She smiled, resting her head on his chest against a
bounding heart.

&nbsp;

&quot;No - he thinks that much of me. Each time, I'm what
he wants

me to be.� Each
time is special.� And after, it's gone
forever.� Me, the

place, the time, the dress - it's his creation,
unspoiled, and forever

unshared by anyone.&quot;

&nbsp;

Her words still echoed in his head as they waited in the
dark car.� The

dress fit her like a glove, a black, velvet glove. He
marveled at how

the fabric could be so thin, and yet so opaque.� It moved as though it

was a part of her, revealing fleeting lines of breast,
hip, and thigh

with the slightest motion of her body.� Down the front, a single row of

soft, tiny, black buttons, an inch apart, ran from
neckline to ankle.

He had watched her button each one, an agonizingly slow
process.� She

had taken her time, smiling up at him after every two or
three, as if

to say, &quot;Imagine how long it will take him to get to
me, to open me up,

to peel me like a piece of wet, juicy fruit.&quot;

&nbsp;

The heavy gates swung inward on smooth, silent
hinges.� He hesitated,

his foot hovering above the pedal, now uncertain whether
he could guide

the car through the entrance, then along the densely
wooded drive that

would take her to him.�
She sensed his reluctance and turned to him.

He fought for breath as she leaned closer, her trembling
body draped in

exquisite ebony.�
The fine, delicate swirl of her ear bore sparkling

clusters of emeralds that flirted with the light between
perfectly

placed strands of hair.�
She took his hand.� Her smile was
weak but

genuine.

&nbsp;

&quot;Now that we're here, I can't ask you for this.� I can't bring myself

to utter the words, to sound so selfish, or to hurt
you.&quot;

&nbsp;

Her eyes were liquid and wide with sympathy.� But was there a fleeting

hint of excitement in the flicker of her dark lashes?

&nbsp;

&quot;I can only tell you that it's happened, that it's
something I can't

escape.� Something
in me needs this, something so powerful I feel I'll

self-destruct if I don't see it through.� I don't understand it. I

can't answer your questions.� But I can love you. Is that enough?&quot;

&nbsp;

He flinched when she squeezed his hand lightly, then took
the wheel and

drove through the open gates without a word.� She turned away without

apology, looking straight ahead as he drove on.� The tear he waited for

never came. He knew the road ahead was the only way to
keep her.

&nbsp;

The gates vanished into darkness behind them as the car
crept along a

broad curve, lit only by muted lamps hugging the driveway
at regular

intervals.� He
heard her small sigh as she settled back into the seat,

her eyes now staring miles into the night.� Guessing her thoughts

tortured him as he peered ahead into the blackness.� Was she already

with him? Did she know his plan?� Was she eager to escape his costume

for the night, to be naked and used in a game of their
making?� Or was

it the anticipation of the unknown - something that would
push her far

past boundaries not yet crossed?

&nbsp;

The house rose like a glowing fortress, awash in the
blue-white of

countless lights spread over the sprawling grounds.� The hulking

Georgian manor, spacious entry court, and winding drive
were carved out

of the surrounding dense vegetation that contained the
light within it,

keeping the property in near-daylight long after
sunset.� A wide portico

supporting six massive ionic columns dropped to the level
of the

circular driveway through a series of gleaming white
marble steps that

sparkled under the intense light.� He stopped the car in front of them,

peering into the rows of tall, arched windows lining the
front of the

massive two-story structure.� Taking his hand again, she looked as

though she belonged there - elegant, beautiful, a
precious gift to

be enjoyed, treasured, possessed.

&nbsp;

&quot;Wait for me?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I'd rather not.�
I - I don't think I can...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;No, my love.�
I'm not asking.� He is.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;But, he never said anything about having to watch
you with him.� I

couldn't take that. Isn't this enough?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;He doesn't want you watch us.� In fact, he won't allow it.� I'm his

and his alone when we're together.� But you must show that you're

willing to share me, to give me to him whenever he
wants.� Bringing me

&nbsp;

here to him, and later returning me to our bed is the
only gesture he

demands.� You have
to give me willingly.� It's sex, not
love.� I love

you.� I always
will.� Please show him you'll wait.&quot;

&nbsp;

She was out of the car before he could answer, making her
way up the

rows of steps.� As
she turned just briefly to glance back at him, he

noticed the flush across her face, and her hardened
nipples straining

against the delicate fabric.

&nbsp;

She rang the bell at the door.� He watched her as she waited patiently,

hands at her sides, the slim curves of her body on
display in the

finest detail under the intense light.� Even so, the black dress clung

to her body in ways that would have made her
unrecognizable to him from

the back, had she not just left her place beside him
minutes ago.

&nbsp;

The door opened.�
She took a step forward.� His arms
encircled her, one

at the waist, the other moving up her back until his
fingers dug into

chestnut curls, pulling her closer.� She lifted her chin and opened her

mouth to him.� He
covered it with his, suddenly pleased that her

response was so eager, that she would so savagely invade
his mouth

while her husband watched.� His hand moved lower, palm now gliding over

the hard flesh of her ass, naked under the wisp of black
cloth.� She

moved close against him, her legs closing around the
muscle of his

thigh.� Her hips
tilted into him, then again, and again, as the kiss

became more frenzied.

&nbsp;

Steven watched them from the car, the kiss, his caresses,
her thighs

clutching the stranger's leg, hips grinding against him
in heat.� And

when he thought he could watch no longer, they
stopped.� Two large

hands appeared on her shoulders.� He was speaking to her. She was

nodding, slowly, mechanically.� His hands disappeared again, retreating

down the front of her dress, busy, doing what? From the
back it was

difficult to tell.�
His hands reappeared on her shoulders, this time

pulling the dark material to the sides, then down, over
her arms, until

her bare back glistened in the floodlights.� Elyse stood before him,

naked to the waist, her hands now busy below his belt,
her actions also

hidden from her husband's sight.

&nbsp;

She knelt, now on her knees below him, her hands still
busy, still

hidden from her husband by waves of shining hair.� Her small fingers

closed around his cock, smoothly running the length of it
as the tip

grew wet before her eyes.�
She closed her lips around it, the ball of

flesh hard and warm against her tongue.� She welcomed the familiar

taste of him, and let him know with eager but careful
teasing, sucking

and licking just as he had taught her.� But this time it was different.

She was wet, and loved the feel of him in her mouth as
she had on each

occasion, but now she felt her husband's eyes upon
her.� Would he allow

her this one passion?�
Was he strong enough to accept her physical need

for another and be party to it as well?� She loved Steven desperately.

He nourished her soul.�
But Simon fed her cunt, and her mind refused to

consider having to choose, should it come to that.

&nbsp;

Steven watched them from the car, stomach tied in knots,
glancing away

each time doubt began to overcome him.� Although he saw nothing but his

wife on her knees in front of him, her flexing back naked
in the night

air, agonizing images filled his head - her lips sucking
greedily at

the stranger's cock, her hands busy, milking, coaxing the
semen from

his body into her waiting mouth.� He fought the temptation to escape,

to turn the key and drive away.� But he knew her well enough by now to

recognize the genuineness of her love for him and her
need for this

stranger's hold on her.

&nbsp;

At that distance, it was difficult to make out the man's
features.� The

skin of deep bronze against the crisp white shirt,
shining jet-black

hair pulled back, bound into a short tail, all suggested
a man of Latin

descent.� And the
voice on the phone; he thought he detected a slight

accent beneath the intimidating, articulate voice.� His display of

total control as Elyse knelt before him, her naked
breasts offered to

him as Steven imagined her caressing a stranger's cock
with her lips

and tongue, all against the backdrop of the brilliantly
lit mansion

presented a surreal and painfully erotic scene that
mesmerized him. As

much as he needed to look away, he found he could not.

&nbsp;

After a minute, maybe two, the man reached for her,
pulling her gently

to her feet.� His
hands appeared again, this time lifting the dress

back over her shoulders, methodically fastening the open
buttons, one

by one.� The
demonstration was brief but effective.�
Elyse understood

the intent all too well, but wondered whether the show of
power was

excessive, considering the emotions her husband must
already be

juggling.� She also
knew that power was everything to Simon, power and

control.� He would
insist on an offering, a sacrifice, from her husband

from the start.� To
witness her submission from behind, with few

details, forcing Steven to imagine her mouth on Simon's
cock, to ask

himself if her nipples hardened when she touched her
lover, to agonize

over what Simon saw as he looked down over her bare
shoulders and firm,

young breasts - all this was what he would demand.� Simon took her

hand, and as the mansion swallowed them she warmed
inside, knowing she

had not heard the engine rev or the car speed away into
the night.

������������������������������ Chapter 3

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

She sat some ten feet away from Simon in the
walnut-paneled library.

Glasses of brandy rested on identical cherry tables
beside each richly

upholstered wingback chair.� He was unusually quiet this evening,

taking time to savor the rich, dark drink, allowing her
to nearly

finish her own generous portion.� She expected he would talk of her

husband, and was apprehensive about betraying her love
for him, even

with unshared thoughts.�
Instead, he sat and watched her, his fierce

eyes drinking in her slim body, harboring clues to her
fate later in

the night.

&nbsp;

&quot;Do you love me?&quot;

&nbsp;

His first words startled her, both with their suddenness
and their

content. She hesitated, trying to guess the answer he
wanted from her.

&nbsp;

&quot;Simon - I...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Do_you_love_me?�
A simple question - four words - none more than four

letters.&quot;

&nbsp;

His eyes were locked on hers - dark with savage
intensity. Her hand

trembled as she reached for her brandy, only to find the
glass empty.

&nbsp;

&quot;I love my husband.�
I love your cock.&quot;

&nbsp;

He stiffened suddenly and leaned forward in his chair,
dark eyes

narrowing.

&nbsp;

&quot;Such language from a pretty wife.� The day will come when I tire

of your hungry, young body.� Poor little thing, hanging on my gate,

used and discarded.&quot;

&nbsp;

He had never spoken to her like this.� Would he turn her away for

giving just one wrong answer?� Should she beg?� Play indignant, or

proud?� What did he
want from her?

&nbsp;

His fierce stare melted into a wide smile.

&nbsp;

&quot;But how could I possibly discard such a thirsty
young woman who knows

so well what she wants, and loves.� Oh, I did very much like the sound

of that - what was it again?&quot;

&nbsp;

Now she trembled for a different reason.� She felt the coolness between

her legs where her juices pooled, wetting her inner
thighs.

&nbsp;

&quot;I love your cock, Simon.&quot;

&nbsp;

His smile faded a bit, his eyebrows arched, then after a
few thoughtful

seconds, he tilted his head to the side with lips pursed.

&nbsp;

&quot;I love your cock, Simon,&quot; she purred slowly,
letting her heat warm

every word.

&nbsp;

He poured another drink, then rose and went to her,
half-filling her

glass as well.� She
drank it in gulps, not stopping until it was gone.

When he reached for her the empty glass slipped from her
hand,

shattering with a pop on the hardwood floor.� Without flinching, he

began to open the dress; one button, then two, three,
lingering

deliberately before going to the next, savoring the trail
of tender

skin left behind as the front of the dress parted.� It seemed to take

forever, and by the time he had undone the last button,
she was

breathless and limp.�
She slid lower in the chair over the slick

fabric of the open dress, until her hips passed over the
edge of the

seat, supported only by her splayed legs stretched out on
either side

of him.

&nbsp;

&quot;Are you wet?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;God yes, Simon. Can't you see?&quot;

&nbsp;

The dress had fallen away from her belly and legs.� He studied the

swelling slit between her legs with a puzzled frown.

&nbsp;

&quot;Show me.&quot;

&nbsp;

She struggled to hold her cunt open to him, her fingers
slippery with

the fluids that poured from her.� She had never felt more naked, 

more vulnerable.�
But that's what Simon did.� Why
did it feel so good? 

From what dark corner of her imagination had this
maddening addiction 

Freed itself?� Her
husband was just fifty yards away, waiting for her

to return to him, knowing that she would give her body to
Simon in ways

that would forever remain her secret.� Was at least a sliver of the

excitement from knowing her husband agreed to surrender
her, and would

likely do so in the future?� Was it really his strength, his compromise

to keep them together, or some perverted sense of power
over him that

made her dripping wet so quickly tonight?

&nbsp;

&quot;Play with yourself.�
I want to watch your face as you cum.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Please Simon, I -&quot;

&nbsp;

A sudden ripple of disappointment shot through her.� Her first orgasm

was always the most intense, and riding it out without
his cock in her

was something she hadn't expected.

&nbsp;

&quot;Well, well. You are a spirited little thing
tonight.� You've never

hesitated for a second at one of my requests - always
eager to play

the slut so unbecoming a prim and proper wife.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I - I want you inside me when I cum.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;So.� We
regress.� Remember how we play?� Simon says...&quot;

&nbsp;

She sank two fingers deep inside, then drew them out
slowly, one along

each side of the hard, wet button of flesh.� Cradling it between them,

she eased both fingers along her swollen clit, circling
over the

sensitive tip every so often with a trembling swirl.

&nbsp;

He stood between her outstretched legs and watched with
satisfaction,

then raised the half-full glass of brandy in the air over
her, tilting

it slightly just above her upturned face.

&nbsp;

&quot;Simon says, 'Open'.&quot;

&nbsp;

Her mouth fell open just in time to catch the ribbon of
burgundy that

fell from the rim of his glass.� He smiled down at her as he kept it

coming, soon filling her mouth faster than she could
swallow it.� As it

overflowed across her chin he followed with the glass,
pouring a thin,

steady stream over her breasts and belly, until it
funneled between her

legs, mixing with her own sticky nectar, finally
trickling into a

building puddle on the floor below.

&nbsp;

&quot;Decisions, decisions.� What should I do with such an anxious young

lady?� Should I
grant her her wish and stick my cock in her?�
Although,

I haven't really heard her beg convincingly for it this
evening.

&nbsp;

Perhaps I should bring her husband inside.� We could watch her face 

together, her body twitching as she fingers herself to
orgasm in my library.&quot;

&nbsp;

He turned his back to her and walked slowly toward the
door.� Would he

do it - even after he had promised not to push her
husband hard enough

to endanger their marriage?� He was going too far - she couldn't allow

it - but she was so wet, now suddenly much closer to the
brink, still

without his prick filling her.

&nbsp;

&quot;Simon, please!�
I can't - can't hold out - much - much - longer.� I

need you, Simon.� I
need - your - cock in me.� I - need -
your - cock -

I need - your - cock - I -&quot;

&nbsp;

He wore a pleased grin as he turned to face her.

&nbsp;

&quot;Ahh, you have such a way with words - convincing
words indeed.&quot;

&nbsp;

His chair was only a few steps away.� He went to it, sat, unzipped the

front of his pants, and pulled his erection through the
opening.� Her

eyes were glued to it - so hard and thick, like a bar of
bronze

sculpted into a warm likeness of the perfect cock.

&nbsp;

&quot;Simon says, 'Over here.'&quot;

&nbsp;

She slid over the edge of the chair until her knees
touched the floor,

allowed the dress to fall from her shoulders, then
crawled to him on

hands and knees, slowly, with her head down, the way she
knew he would

want her.� Stopping
between his parted legs, she waited for the sound

of his voice.� He
withheld it until he could see her shiver, knowing

that her need to be filled grew with each agonizing
second.� He watched

in silence as the small of her long, smooth back arched,
her ass rising

and falling almost imperceptibly in a futile effort to
bring relief to

the ache between her shaking thighs.� 'How long would she wait?' he

wondered.� Hours? -
Days? - this fragile, loving wife, cowering, naked

on the floor below, silently begging to be taken by a
stranger...

&nbsp;

She watched her breasts hanging and quivering, engorged
nipples

straining toward the floor, and through the space between
them the

small tuft of hair matted and dripping with her
juices.� In time she

closed her eyes, knowing that the sight of her body's
response to him

would only excite her more.� Soon her eyes were clenched tight as she

struggled to concentrate, to become whatever he wanted
that night,

at whatever cost.

&nbsp;

Her body shook in rhythmic spasms.� Ridges of muscle rose between her

shoulder blades, and her inner thighs flexed and relaxed
in an

uncontrollable cadence.�
He waited for a sign - something new,

something not easily surrendered.� When her tears fell from within

the tangle of hair that covered her face, landing with
tiny splats

between his feet, he spoke.

&nbsp;

&quot;Look at me.&quot;

&nbsp;

Elyse raised her head slowly. Thick waves of hair parted
to reveal her

tear-streaked face.

&nbsp;

&quot;Interesting.�
What brings tears to the eyes of a wife as she sluts for

another man?� Is it
shame, an overpowering disgrace born from the

incapacity to control her own desires?� Or is it simply pure lust, her

body's final desperate mechanism for dealing with
extended deprivation,

fired by a ravenous carnal appetite? Of course, a true
slut could

never feel shame.�
A true slut would abandon everything for a good hard

fucking, never stopping to think twice about her future,
or the future

of those she loves.�
So which is it? Tell me, are these the tears of

a slut or sinner?&quot;

&nbsp;

She searched his eyes for some small hint that this was
just a game,

hoping that he would break into a sympathetic laugh,
scoop her up in

his arms, and take her to his bed.� Soon she understood her answer was

required, a necessary part of their evening together. But
which

answer?

&nbsp;

&quot;Both.� I'm
both, Simon.&quot;

&nbsp;

Her voice cracked and wavered. She could taste the salt
of her own

tears.

&nbsp;

&quot;I-I'm your slut-your slut, Simon.� And-and sinner-and worse, in my

husband's eyes.&quot;

&nbsp;

Leaning forward, he ran his fingers lightly over her
face, then cradled

it in his strong hands.�
She welcomed the gentle pressure as he drew

her closer, stopping just inches from his towering
erection.

&nbsp;

&quot;You may be many things in his eyes, but *you've*
made this a refuge

from such things, a refuge from all things proper and
respectable.

You've asked him to bring you here, and beyond that, to
wait in the

wings as I use his wife's body in ways that must test the
limits of his

imagination.&quot;

&nbsp;

He paused, his fingers working their way under her hair,
circling the

small, delicate contours of her ears, then trailing
lower, caressing

cool bare skin at the back of her neck.

&nbsp;

&quot;I'm not interested in the sinner.� The world is full of sinners. So

don't waste my time with words.� Actions speak with much more

conviction.&quot;

&nbsp;

She sat up, rested her hands on his thighs, and took the
solid, golden

head of his cock into her mouth.� Closing her lips tightly just over

the jutting ridge of the glans, she attacked the meat of
it with the

tip of her tongue.�
She could feel the beat of his pulse as she tested

the hard ball of flesh, pushing hard against it, swirling
around the

edges, then gently probing the eye at it's center.� Each precious

droplet teased from him arrived warm and sweet against
the back of her

throat.

&nbsp;

&quot;I don't think I've ever seen you suck me with such
abandon, or for

that matter, any wife so willing take another man's cock
in her mouth.

Are you as eager to take your husband's in the same
way?&quot;

&nbsp;

She stopped and looked up at him.

&nbsp;

&quot;We don't - I mean, not like this.� It's different with him.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I see.&quot;

&nbsp;

He sighed, showing his frustration with her evasive answer.

&nbsp;

&quot;Please, don't...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Come now.�
Whining doesn't become you, my dear.�
Tell me.� I insist.

Just how different is this husband of yours?&quot;

&nbsp;

She lowered her eyes.�
Her nipples seemed to reach out to him,

embarrassingly hard.

&nbsp;

&quot;It's more - more, comfortable with him, I
guess.� It's safe, calm,

warm, wrapped around each other in our bed.� I could never - I mean,

it's just not the same.�
He'd think - &quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;You may be surprised what he thinks.� Must a wife who does her whorish

best by night forsake the lady she's become by day?� You think nothing

of offering your body to me for whatever amusement I
might invent.� In

fact you flaunt your lust, so desperately, so ravenously,
for what you

could easily have at home.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I don't understand it, Simon.� It's not as simple as you make it.� I'm

not proud of this - I know I'm hurting him deeply.� Do you think I enjoy

that?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Do you?�
There is a certain exhilaration in exercising one's

power over another, even if it's someone close to your
heart.� The

liberation from feelings of powerlessness can be a
stimulating

awakening.� And, as
horrifying as you might find it on the surface, the

pain you deliver with a newfound weapon can be both
empowering and

arousing.&quot;

&nbsp;

A sudden chill shook her, causing her hands to tremble as
she moved

them along his thighs.�
When her hands found his erection she closed

them gently around the firm shaft.� She could feel the heat it radiated

before touching him, and imagined it flowing into her
fingers, along

her bare arms, then into the core of her body, finally
chasing the

chill back from where his words had summoned it.

&nbsp;

She found herself crying again - suddenly, unexpectedly
sobbing,

despite the comforting warmth that poured into her.

&nbsp;

&quot;Please stop, Simon.�
Why can't you leave him out of this?�
Why won't

you just fuck me?�
I'm begging, Simon - oh God, I'm begging you...&quot;

&nbsp;

He rose and went to a desk at the far side of the
room.� From the wide

center drawer he retrieved a coil of thick, heavy
cord.� Her heart

raced when she saw it, partly from fear, partly from
excitement.� He

ran a portion of it through his fingers, now careful not
to look at

her.� It was woven
of black silk, thick as his finger, but hollow at

its center.�
Looping it loosely around his hand several times, he

tightened it slowly, feeling it collapse slightly as its
suppleness

conformed to the contours of his knuckles and palm.

&nbsp;

She was on her knees by his chair when he returned.� He reached for her

hand, she gave it, and he helped her to her feet.� Gently but firmly,

he brought her wrists together, circled them three times
with the cord,

then once more, passing it between them, finally tying
the knot between

her palms.� He
again looped the remaining length about his hand and

headed for the wide, open stairs that led to his
bedroom.� She

followed, two short steps behind, as much as the rope
would allow, her

cunt open, red, and flowing with juices from an hour's
torment.

������������������������������ Chapter 4

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&quot;If only others could see you as I do.&quot;

&nbsp;

He paced slowly as he spoke, eyes feasting on white flesh
against the

crimson sheets under her.�
The bed, a heavy four-poster with a canopy

frame, was positioned at the very center of the
room.� At first sight

it was an imposing structure, a fusion of dark carved
woods and

burnished metal in an old-world Mediterranean style.� As he circled it,

he studied her from every angle. Her thin wrists were
stretched above

her head, bound by two feet of cord secured to a grille
of metal bars

at the headboard.�
A tangle of brown hair framed her face, one eye

hidden behind sweat-soaked strands that clung to her
forehead and cheek.� 

Her open lips waited, red and full, poised, ready at the
next

instant to beg him to finish her.

&nbsp;

'Such wanton elegance,' he mused.� 'Delicate shoulders carved from

the purest alabaster...white breasts firm enough to mimic
stone, yet

soft enough to allow cherry-red nipples to quiver with
each

breath...the flat belly, showing a hint of muscle beneath
it, as though

carved by a master sculptor to compliment the sleek lines
of her long

waist...legs, white as glistening ivory, chiseled and
slim, a thin

layer of satin drawn tightly over stone cut and polished
by hands of

passion and grace.'

&nbsp;

He could almost understand how a husband might prefer
sharing such a

treasure to losing her.

&nbsp;

Small lamps mounted on the inside of each corner of the
canopy bathed

her body in blue-white light.� The rest of the room was dark, and the

bright light blinded her to his progress and exact
position.� Only

during the few moments when he passed the foot of the bed
could she be

sure he remained in the room with her, his crisp, white
shirt and

golden cock emerging from the shadows just long enough to
rewet her

appetite for him.

&nbsp;

Minutes later, he appeared beside her at the edge of the
bed.� He was

naked, and the sudden sight of him sent a shudder of
expectation

through her.� He
held a small silver vial, just slightly taller than a

thimble.� Within it
rested a thin needle topped with a single black 

pearl that seemed to hover above the lip of the container
in the

brilliant light.�
As he withdrew it, a drop of clear liquid fell from

the sharp tip back into the waiting pool at the bottom of
the miniature

reservoir.

&nbsp;

She shifted away from him as he brought the needle
closer.

&nbsp;

&quot;Are you afraid?&quot;

&nbsp;

Her eyes told him before she could speak.� &quot;Yes,&quot; she whispered.

&nbsp;

&quot;I could untie you, set you free.� Your husband is waiting.&quot;

&nbsp;

She shook her head without hesitation, as if to chase
away any chance

of retreat.�
&quot;No!&quot; - another whisper, but one more forceful.

&nbsp;

The tip of the needle arrived at her breast, stopping at
the edge of

the bright pink areola.�
With a quick stabbing motion, he tapped the

point repeatedly over the sensitive skin.� She gasped, then began to

moan quietly as the needle danced over the engorged
button of flesh.

The pressure was never enough to draw blood, but
sufficient to deliver

minute quantities of the drug just below the surface of
the tender

nipple.� He
returned the needle to the shining vial, wetting the tip

again and again, until both nipples lay wet and
glistening in the harsh

light.

&nbsp;

He stopped, watching the circles surrounding her nipples
darken to an

angry red.� She
gasped as the tickle of the needle turned to burning

twinges, finally subsiding to a constant, mild irritation
that made her

squirm and pull against her bonds.

&nbsp;

And then he was gone.�
The darkness surrounding the bed simply

swallowed him.� She
called out to him, begging him to return, to

extinguish the fire that had started at her breasts and
now crawled

methodically through her, seizing her cunt with raging
urgency.� Her

cries echoed through the room, unanswered.� She cried out louder, slim

legs now shifting to one side, then the other in a futile
attempt at

relief or freedom.�
The cord around her wrists tightened and held.

Helpless and alone under the intense light, she felt as
though she

might suffocate in it's heat, a heat that suddenly seemed
to melt her

womb, sending it flowing between her legs like a river of
molten lead.

&nbsp;

Suddenly, he was there, kneeling on the bed, naked,
between her

restless thighs.�
He watched her with piercing eyes, his golden chest

shining, his erection thicker and harder than she had
ever remembered

it.� Multicolored
spikes of light surrounded him, flickering and

wavering as they stretched from his bronzed skin into the
shadows of

the darkened room.�
His voice seemed distant and out of sync with the

words that formed on his lips.

&nbsp;

&quot;My, my.�
Where has she gone? Mommy and Daddy's good little girl - a

husband's faithful and loving wife - the proud day-virgin
and reluctant

concubine.� What
would they say if they could see your hungry little

cunt yawning for my cock?�
What words could you possibly use to make

them understand?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Please, Simon...I'm begging you...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Your answer is the price for my company tonight -
and ultimately, the

price for coaxing my cock inside you.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Simon...I don't care...none of it matters...none of
it...&quot;

&nbsp;

Her slim hips rose off the bed as she spoke, pumping
uncontrollably in

a futile attempt to somehow capture the swollen purple
head that jutted

and bobbed, still impossibly far away.

&nbsp;

&quot;Ahh, finally, the truth.� None of it matters - it's empty baggage, a

burden you needn't bear.�
Here, to be free of it is a simple choice -

your choice - no one else's.

&nbsp;

He moved closer, finally edging the head of his cock just
inside her.

He waited until her cunt tightened around it, then went
deeper, filling

her slowly with inch after inch of rigid flesh.� Each time with him was

as if she was taken by a new lover; the unyielding girth
of his sex

stretching her, then the solid presence filling her
belly, possessing

her more completely than any man ever had, or quite
possibly ever

would.� It took an
entire minute for him to bury himself in her.�
She

wound her legs around his waist, her torso drawn tight
between bound

wrists and the small of his arched back.� He sank the last inch into

her and stopped, pinning her to the bed.� Her eyes fluttered and

closed.� Her lips
formed a small, satisfied smile.� She had
taken all

of him - from the hard, blunt tip nestled snugly against
her cervix, to

the thick, flaring root that ground against her as his
hips pressed

into her in small, firm circles under his body's weight.

&nbsp;

She whimpered when he pulled out suddenly, surprised by
the emptiness

in her belly.� She
opened her eyes again, squinting in the bright

light.� He knelt
between her legs, his lean stomach and broad chest

gleaming with sweat.�
The aura that surrounded him burned with shifting

color, now pulsing violently with vibrant reds and
glowing violets.

His penis seemed immense as it jutted in the air over
her, growing

longer and thicker as though reflected in a funhouse
mirror.� The room

was spinning.� She
closed her eyes.� The bed seemed to fall
away,

leaving her floating above it, weightless and calm.

&nbsp;

He was turning her, rolling her onto her belly.� His hands were cool,

his grasp firm against her naked thighs.� She drew her knees under her,

offering her ass to him.�
What she needed came quickly - his strong

hands spreading her, then the hot, blunt presence against
the entrance,

pressing forward slowly, boring into her, deep enough to
awaken flesh

untouched by any other.�
The sensation of the cord about her wrists,

the cool sheet against her face, the sting of the
fullness invading

her, all melted into the single essence of what she had
become.� No

longer wife, nor woman, nor even flesh - only need and
desire,

&nbsp;

desperate to be possessed, to be taken by hands that
would reduce her

to nothing, a zero, dissolving her demons in a sudden
rush of Simon's

scalding sperm as it bathed her bowels.

&nbsp;

The skillful caress of his fingers between her legs sent
her into a

welcome abyss, falling and floating at the same time
through explosions

of warmth and color, her own cries echoing in the
distance as though

they were the urgent calls of some primitive wild
animal.� Then the

darkness arrived, a luscious cradle that closed in around
her, sucking

away her flesh with a delicious, persistent embrace that
slowly

consumed her until only the lush fullness deep in her
belly remained.

Finally it too faded, the encroaching blackness stealing
even the

nothingness she had become, until it swallowed everything
that

remained.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

����� ����������������������������***

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The car had become a prison for him.� An hour passed, then two, and

finally a third.�
He should do something - go in after her, confront

the man that took her inside, insist she return with him
to their own

home, to their own bed.�
Why had he allowed this in the first place?

What kind of man gives his wife to a stranger, and then
waits for him

to finish with her?�
Her face haunted him, so child-like when they met,

and even now, years later, it still cheated the passage
of time.� She

remained an innocent Lolita with the body of a mature,
ripe woman.� He

knew men desired her.�
He saw them look, listened to their suggestive

banter at parties, cloaked in the feeblest attempts at
platonic intent.

But she had never given them the slightest satisfaction
of a knowing

reply.� She would
simply take his hand, or pull his arm closer around

her slim waist, as if to let him know she was his and his
alone.

&nbsp;

The temptation to go to her was overwhelming, so much so
that twice he

left the car.� The
first time he was able to do little more than circle

the car, then stand by the open door, his eyes searching
the tall

windows for any trace of movement.� The second time he could go no

farther than halfway to the marble steps before
retreating, all the

while remembering her soft pleading just before she went
inside.� Now

he sat staring at his hands on the wheel, weary from
questions he

couldn't answer, needing her next to him more than he
ever had.

&nbsp;

Then she was running toward him, her body glowing in the
light that

still bathed the house.�
The simple white nightshirt rose over her

thighs as she ran. Bare legs and feet flashed, gracefully
carrying her

forward, like an angel gliding through the night.� She snuggled next to

him in the car, an arm around his neck, a hand placed
peacefully on

his chest.� She
nuzzled his neck, her damp hair cool and fragrant

against his skin.

&nbsp;

&quot;Mmmmm - take me home?&quot;

&nbsp;

She was asleep within minutes.� He carried her from the car to their

bed. She moved close to him, pressing her body against
his, a contented

smile now fixed to her innocent face.� After letting some time pass, he

placed a hand on her breast, moving a finger over her
hardening nipple.

She sighed, uttered something soft and unintelligible in
her sleep,

then turned from him and sighed again one last time.� He lay beside her

as the hours passed, never sleeping, her gentle breathing
filling him

with both fear and desire until dawn.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

������������������������������� Chapter 5

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

He woke slowly, first to the constant hiss and sizzle,
then to the

familiar smell of bacon, teasing him from his sleep with
a hint of a

perfect breakfast made just as she knew he would want
it.� Sleep had

finally come to him sometime early in the morning, but
the lack of it

hung about him as he lifted his legs over the side of the
bed and stood

to face the day. She had drawn the blinds so he could
sleep late, and

waited until mid-morning to start his breakfast.� He would shower

first, buying some time to think about what he might say
to her, and

what she may or may not want to share about the night
before.

&nbsp;

To his surprise, she greeted him with her dazzling smile
and a kiss as

she brought him his food.�
He chose to eat, saving any words till

later, waiting for her to offer up excuses or an
apology.� None came,

so he picked at his breakfast in silence as she hummed
quietly to

herself while busily cleaning the kitchen.

&nbsp;

Later that afternoon as he dozed in front of the
television, she

snuggled next to him, her small hand stroking his inner
thigh.� He

opened his eyes to find her staring at him with a
mischievous grin.

&nbsp;

&quot;Take me to bed and fuck me?&quot;

&nbsp;

They were words he had never heard her use, but words
that caused his

cock to stir in spite of the questions she had still not
answered.

&quot;So, it's over - you won't go to him again?&quot;

&nbsp;

She slid her hand under his belt, gently closing her
fingers around his

erection.

&nbsp;

&quot;I want *you*. I want your cock inside me.� I want you to fuck me till

I scream.&quot;

&nbsp;

Who was this woman?�
As uncertain as he was, he found it impossible not

to play along, impossible not to kiss her deeply when she
moved onto

his lap, impossible not to fuck her like a wild animal in
their bed,

and finally, impossible not to wonder what went through
her mind as she

found her second orgasm under him, thrashing and
screaming just as she

had promised.

&nbsp;

Afterwards she lay pressed against him, slowly running
her fingers over

his chest and nipples.�
She looked so satisfied, no, contented was more

accurate.� He had
no choice but to try to make some sense of it.

&nbsp;

&quot;Why do you do it?&quot; he asked, as he stared at
the ceiling.

&nbsp;

&quot;You mean go to him, don't you?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;You make it sound like a friendly visit when you
put it that way.� Go

to him?� Why don't
you just say it?� You have sex with him -
you go to

let him fuck you.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Do you want me to say that, to tell you in those words?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I want you to tell me why!� Why can't you tell me what you need

instead of going to another man?� What does he do for you that I can't?

Just tell me what you want - I'll do it - anything,
anything at all!&quot;

&nbsp;

She sighed, then trailed her fingertips over his belly,
finding his

spent erection and working it gently between her fingers.

&nbsp;

&quot;Are you sure you want to know?� I could say things that would hurt you

terribly, and you'd regret asking.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I regret asking in the first place.� But what am I supposed to do?

Sit quietly by while you have sex with this man, and
never question

why?� If you still
love me, if you want a future together, what could

you say that would hurt me?&quot;

&nbsp;

Her eyes peered into his, searching for a sign that he
meant what he

said, for just a brief hint of inner strength, or
possibly arousal.

How might he react if she led him along such a tenuous
path?� The risk

was enormous - how could she tell her husband such
things?� And why did

the anticipation of his response make her so wet, her
belly so

desperate to be filled?

&nbsp;

&quot;I could say I go because he's handsome, and
incredibly sexy.� I

could say he's very wealthy and spares no expense to
please me.� I may

even tell you how he satisfies me in bed, that he's a
wonderful lover,

that he drives me to the brink of my senses when he makes
me cum.&quot;

&nbsp;

She paused, still playing with his cock under the damp
sheet, finally

finding it growing hard again in her hand.� She smiled at him, now

knowing he accepted at least some small part of her
obsession, that

he loved her enough to find some pleasure in giving her
such an

unlikely gift.� And
then he turned away from her, shuddered, and drew a

sudden, halting breath. Moving close to him, Elyse
stroked his hair

lightly as he lay staring silently into the
darkness.� She wanted his

reaction, and now she had it.

&nbsp;

&quot;None of those things are why I go.� I may never be able to

convince you, but it's true,&quot; she told him, almost
in a whisper.

&nbsp;

&quot;True?� You've
done a pretty good job of convincing me otherwise.&quot;

&nbsp;

She pressed closer, throwing a bare leg over him, then
turned him

toward her again and eased on top of him, her small firm
breasts pushed

high up on his heaving chest.

&nbsp;

&quot;I can't tell you why I go.� I don't know myself.� It's not you.�
It's

not him.� It's
me.� Something in me - something
terrifying and exciting

at the same time.�
I love my life with you.� But - I
don't know -

something happens there, something that renews a part of
me that I

never knew was empty.�
And after, I love you even more, so deeply, so

fully, as though I have so much more to give you than
I've ever been

able to share before.�
I love being with you; just your touch makes me

warm and safe.� I
crave your body constantly.� I fantasize
about your

cock inside me, and how wonderful it feels.� No other man could make me

feel the way I do when I cum with you inside me.� It's true.�
Whether

you believe me or not, I live for you and you
alone.&quot;

&nbsp;

She was so beautiful, so convincing.� He struggled wildly with

jealousy, love, and his best attempt at
understanding.� But if she

couldn't understand her obsession, how could he, even at
his best?

&nbsp;

In the weeks that followed, he found it impossible to
doubt her.� She

found it impossible not to relish her new freedom, and
every minute of

every day showed her love to him in everything she
did.� Each touch

proved her sincerity.

&nbsp;

Their lovemaking became a series of adventures, each
spontaneous and

more daring than the last.� She stripped for him at night after dinner

as slow earthy jazz oozed from the stereo and the dimmed
blue light she

bought only that afternoon silhouetted her body as she
twisted hungrily

before him.� She
spoke to him graphically, breathlessly, as they

returned from a Saturday visit to the museum, telling him
how the lines

and mass of a certain sculpture made her think of how
wonderful his own

body looked to her, how it made her hot and wet, so much
so she

couldn't wait to have him - so she took him there in the
car as he

drove, eagerly swallowing his semen as though it was hot
tea and honey.

She arrived at his office late one Friday afternoon
flaunting a new

coat, one of luxuriously thick silver and white fur.� She felt the

stares of his colleagues, from bare calf to the upper
curves of her

breasts left enticingly exposed.� Their attention warmed her a little,

but she went to her husband without a smile or glance at
the others. 

In the seclusion of his office, she opened the coat and
let it slide off

her shoulders, finally naked before him with a hunger in
her eyes that

by now, he knew all too well. They made love on the
carpet in front of

his desk, door unlocked, all the while sensing the danger
of being seen

by an intruder, overwhelmed by their passion for each
other.

&nbsp;

After a month, Steven had forgiven everything.� 'A small price,' he told

himself.� Memory of
the mansion and the dark man in it went to the

place where memories go that are not forgotten, but only
return with

the most deliberate provocation.� Now, not even the moans

of her loudest orgasm set them free.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It arrived a month later, delivered by a tuxedoed
messenger who smiled

briefly, then returned to the limo waiting at the
curb.� The package

was large and black, its length and width secured tightly
by a gleaming

silver cable of ribbon.�
A single red rose was tied at the center with

a shining knot nestled between clusters of menacing
thorns.� Steven

stood behind the closed door for a full minute, not able
to take a

step, staring at his own reflection in the glossy
surface.

&nbsp;

&quot;What is it? What's wrong?&quot;

&nbsp;

Elyse had come up behind him in her bare feet, and her
voice startled

him. He turned, holding the package carefully out in
front of him as

though it might be radioactive.

&nbsp;

&quot;Oh. That.&quot;

&nbsp;

He lifted his eyes from the box. Elyse stood there in her
robe, her

expression at first calm, then apologetic. She seemed to
be waiting

for him to speak.

&nbsp;

&quot;Please don't go.&quot;

&nbsp;

His voice sounded so small, as though he barely had the
air to make the

words come.� He
wanted her to move closer, to take the box and hurl it

into the trash and assure him she could never go to him
again.� Instead

she looked down at the box as though sizing its
dimensions. Steven

shivered as he imagined she was guessing its contents.

&nbsp;

&quot;You don't have to go. He can't force you.&quot;

&nbsp;

She began to go to him, then stopped after several steps,
lowering her

head as she spoke.�
Her robe was undone, and parted a few extra inches

in the front as she walked.� His eyes wandered down over the trail of

exposed flesh, the inner curves of her breasts, her flat
belly, to the

naked slit between her legs, now freshly shaved and
parted slightly to

reveal a deep red, pulsing core.

&nbsp;

&quot;You don't understand.� He only sees me when I ask.� I thought you knew

that.� It's
me.� I have to go.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;You don't have to go, damn it!� I love you, but even I have limits!

Just how much more do you expect me to take?&quot;

&nbsp;

Her expression changed to one of disappointment.� Her eyes were filled

with more sadness than he had ever seen.

&nbsp;

&quot;I know you have limits.� I suppose I knew you would reach them

eventually, that in the end you would leave.� I need this, and I need

you.� I knew that I
couldn't have both for long - or at least I feared

it.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I never said I was leaving - I don't know if I
could,&quot; Steven said.

&nbsp;

&quot;Then please stay with me, please indulge me, for at
least a while

longer. You won't be sorry. I promise.&quot;

&nbsp;

Her last words were delivered with sultry assurance.� She smiled, and

her eyes brightened.�
Unable to think, he extended the box, offering it

to her.� She moved
to his side and slid the robe off her shoulders,

holding it open, offering her body to him.

&nbsp;

&quot;Put it on the bed, then shower with me.� I want to be close to you

before we go, both of us naked and warm and wet...&quot;

&nbsp;

She offered herself to him under the pulsing jets of
water, eyes

closed, mouth open and panting as Steven ran the soap
over her body.

When his hand trailed between her legs, she reached up
and kissed him,

their bodies pressed together, skin made slick and
sensitive by the

thin film of soapy water between them.� When she felt his erection grow

against her, she went to her knees and played with him,
running soapy

fingers of one hand along the hardening shaft, cupping
and pulling

gently at his balls with the other.� Elyse knew the signs of her

husband's orgasm, and just as he began to thrust his
hips, she stopped,

rising to whisper in his ear.

&nbsp;

&quot;I love your hard cock in my hands, but I can't make
you cum tonight.

He won't allow it.�
But I can stay here with you, help you enjoy it, if

you do it yourself.�
Please - I'd love to see you make yourself cum.

Please my love, for me?&quot;

&nbsp;

Her tongue was in his ear, then licking his neck,
traveling down to

suck at his nipples - and she was moaning, groaning, like
an animal in

heat.� Steven's
head was swimming with lust and confusion.�
He'd said he

would do whatever she wanted - to hell with the man in
the mansion - he

needed her here and now.

&nbsp;

He came after just a few strokes, thrusting and moaning
as Elyse

nibbled at his belly.�
She looked down just as his semen erupted from

the end of his cock, his hand stroking furiously as his
hips pumped

back and forth.�
She fought her own impending orgasm, gained control,

then suddenly lost it again as the warmth rushed over
her. She

stiffened, still on her knees, thighs pressed tightly
together, trying

to shake the involuntary spasms that traveled in waves
from belly to

neck.� It was the
first time she had disobeyed Simon - he forbade her to

cum the day of their meeting.� She hadn't touched herself - another

first for her.� Why
had this happened?� Why had she asked her
husband to

masturbate just hours before giving her to another
man?� And why had

she cum when he gave in so easily to her suggestion?� She went cold as

Simon's words echoed in her head.

&nbsp;

���� &quot;There is
a certain exhilaration in exercising one's

����� power over
another, even if it's someone close to

����� your
heart...as horrifying as you might find it on

����� the surface,
the pain you deliver with a newfound

����� weapon can be
both empowering and arousing.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

His attempts to find the mansion were frustrated at every

turn.� The
neighborhood's streets formed a maze of circles and cul-de-

sacs hidden from one another by dense but impeccably
groomed

landscaping.� Each
time he made a wrong turn and she showed him the

way, he wondered how often she had found it on her
own.� In the dark,

each private entrance looked alike, until they came face
to face with

the twisted bars of his imposing iron gate and the
familiar glass eye

of the camera, peering down at them like a mechanical
cyclops atop the

towering stone pilaster.

&nbsp;

As they waited, he turned to her, only to find her
staring once again

through the ominous gate into the night on the other
side.� She wore

her hair up in a more formal style, revealing tantalizing
glimpses of

supple neck and glittering diamonds decorating each
ear.� She was a

vision, but not one of his own making.

&nbsp;

He remembered her gasp when she opened package, and how
its contents

overflowed its edges, as though it had suddenly taken its
own deep

breath, increasing its volume to double the box's
capacity.� The

material was black as night, and reflected the light as
though it was

partly metallic.�
When she lifted it from the box and held it up in

front of her, it unfolded slowly, its weight surprisingly
light in her

small hands.� She
dressed herself in private, and he was more than

satisfied to let her do it.� It was his turn to gasp when she appeared

from their bedroom, wrapped in the elegant gift from her
enigmatic

lover.

&nbsp;

The material fit her midsection as tightly as a corset,
softening to

cup her breasts in two delicate pouches that barely
covered the tops

her nipples.� Four
gold catches secured the middle about her like a

second skin.� From
hips to floor, the dress expanded in a series of

large horizontal scalloped pleats that trailed slightly
behind her as

she walked.� It
opened down the front in a inverted V, gathered just

below her belly, widening two feet or more by the time it
reached the

floor.� When she
walked, the cascades of pleats opened wider to reveal

her legs, from black heels to the very tops of her bare
thighs.� The

contrast of one slender ivory leg after another, slim
thighs flexing,

thrust through the opening as she took step after step
framed by the

dark flowing fabric, was startling, even to her husband
of so many

years.

&nbsp;

'My God - she could have any man.'

&nbsp;

And then, just at that moment, she had smiled at him, as
though she

could read his every thought.

&nbsp;

Now they sat in silence as the gate opened once again and
the car

slipped through it, winding forward into the night.� She sat taller in

her seat as they approached the house, her shoulders
squared, breasts

thrust forward, heaving against the dress with each slow,
deep breath.

She leaned forward slightly as though she was drawn to
their

destination by the same powerful force that equally
repelled her

husband.

&nbsp;

When the engine died she looked at him with love and
pity.

&nbsp;

&quot;The things you must be thinking about me...and yet
you bring me here,

again.� You must
love me more than I ever imagined.&quot;

&nbsp;

She leaned toward him, circling him with her bare,
slender arms, and

kissed him deeply.�
Pressing closer, she dropped a hand to his lap,

exploring between his legs as the kiss became more
frenzied.� And then,

just as she felt his erection begin to grow, she stopped
and pulled

away, looking lovingly into his eyes once again as she
straightened a

few strands of hair that had come undone.

&nbsp;

&quot;You'll wait for me?&quot;

&nbsp;

He tried to answer.�
Trust and jealousy, love and anger, pride and

humiliation, all sliced his insides to pieces, then tore
the ragged

wounds in all directions.�
He trembled from her lust for him, and from

the frustration of watching that same lust willingly
surrendered to a

man waiting to use it for his own amusement.� He just stared back at

her, an elegant vision, alive with fresh, tempting beauty
and innocent,

smoldering heat.�
How could he say yes, agreeing to let this man use

her eager body a second time while he waited for him to
satisfy her?

How could he say no, and risk losing her to this
maddening obsession?

In the end, he couldn't say anything at all.

&nbsp;

She smiled confidently at him one last time.� Her bare legs seemed to

glow in the light that spilled into the car from the
house behind them.

The dress had opened wider when she moved away from him, and
now

revealed the pale skin of her lower belly and the pouting
lips nestled

between the tops of her thighs. He couldn't take his eyes
from it, and

she let him look, knowing he saw her ripening cunt, juicy
and wet,

ready for what waited for her across the white pavement
beyond the

marble steps.

&nbsp;

Watching her approach the house brought back bitter
memories.� A

different dress, a different night, but the way she moved
toward her

destination, almost strutting with anxious determination,
was painfully

familiar.

&nbsp;

He appeared at the door just as she arrived and stepped
outside to meet

her.� A stray lock
of hair hung free at the side of her face, still

undone from her husband's touch.� He tucked it back in place, then

turned her, moving against her from behind.� She tried her best to

contain a brief moan when his lips found her neck, but
she failed,

suddenly afraid that the soft sounds she made might
escape into the

night air to reach the open car window.� A lean, bronzed forearm and

palm circled her waist, drawing her closer to him, while
another hand

freed her breasts from the front of the dress.� Her nipples hardened at

once and throbbed under his fingertips.� She leaned back against him,

eyes closed, lips trembling as she tried to contain a
second moan.� He

feasted on her bare neck and shoulder, and she cried out
again, louder,

a guttural noise that rose from deep inside her.� This time she was

certain it had reached her husband, but was already
beyond caring.

Simon was pleased that she so quickly shed her
inhibitions before her

waiting husband, and let her know with a whisper as his
teeth grazed

her ear.

&nbsp;

&quot;Slut.&quot;

&nbsp;

The word sent a ripple through her belly, and she pushed
harder against

him, until she could feel the hardened length of his cock
against the

small of her back.�
From the car, her husband watched as she melted

against the man, her nipples swelling so easily as her
cupped her

breasts, her hips grinding into him as her bare legs
parted and swayed

through the open front of the dress.� With her third moan, he raised

the car window and looked away.� He had never heard the sound come from

her before, nor had he ever seen her surrender to lust so
immediately.

When he finally summoned the courage to look toward the
house again,

they had vanished, leaving him alone with his imagination
and pain.

������������������������������ Chapter 8

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

They sat facing each other in a room unfamiliar to
her.� He had led her

past the library to the back of the house where bright
lights no longer

spilled through the towering windows.� It was a room of secrets, dark

and quiet, lit only by shrinking tongues of flame and
dying embers

sputtering in a nearby hearth.� She thought it smelled of man-smells,

of leather, tobacco, and the charred wood of a campfire.

&nbsp;

For a brief minute, just after he took her hand, led her
through the

door, and then closed it, she felt as though she was
transported back

in time - she in her elegant gown, he in his perfectly
tailored jacket,

standing together, awash in flickering sienna.� Now she felt so small,

barely able to reach the armrests of the wide leather
chair.� Sitting

forced the open front of the dress higher, nearly to her
navel,

exposing everything below it - the soft pillow of her
lower belly, her

naked thighs pressing into the leather of the seat
cushion, and the

pouting, freshly shaved cleft between them, glistening at
its center

with a hint of expectation.� She knew by his smile that he approved.

&nbsp;

He moved forward in his chair, edging closer to a small,
round table

that stood between them.�
Lifting an oddly square bottle, he turned

the peeling label toward the fire to read its faded
letters.� She

watched quietly as he poured an inch of emerald liquor
into each of two

heavy crystal goblets.�
The liquid seemed to glow and sparkle through

the many angled facets of glass.� She grew more curious when he

balanced a long, slotted spoon across the top of one of
the glasses,

then lifted a single cube of sugar from a small porcelain
bowl,

centering it on the spoon.� After preparing the second glass in exactly

the same way, he placed it beneath the narrow spigot of a
silver tureen

which stood atop a tiny but steady flame, warming its
contents to just

above body temperature.

&nbsp;

&quot;And the third angel sounded, and a great star,
burning like a lamp,

fell from Heaven, and it fell upon the third part of the
rivers and

fountains of water; and the name of the star is called
Absinthe.&quot;

&nbsp;

He hadn't looked up from his work, and his voice,
suddenly so loud and

at the same time somber, startled her.� Not knowing whether he expected

an answer from her, she sat without a word, eyes now wide
and glassy in

the firelight.

&nbsp;

He stopped and looked up across the table at her, pausing
a second

between her legs before meeting her nervous stare.

&nbsp;

&quot;La Fe Verte. The green fairy. Such a contradiction
- once so

prized, then so despised - how can such a simple thing be
weighed in

such extremes of human desire and aversion? It's only a
drink, after

all. Have you tried it? Absinthe?&quot;

&nbsp;

She had heard the word, but knew little of it.

&nbsp;

&quot;No,&quot; she replied, just louder than a whisper.

&nbsp;

As he eased the spigot open, warm droplets of water fell,
one by one,

onto the cube of sugar, then after wetting it to the
core, dripped

steadily into the waiting glass.� Like some sort of strange alchemy,

the green liquid changed slowly to a murky, opaline
yellow before her

eyes.

&nbsp;

&quot;Aside from 'visions borne of the loins of angels',
it's said that the

ritual of preparation is much of the seduction of
absinthe.� I believe

you know something of the seduction of ritual, don't you
my dear?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I - I never thought of this as a ritual,
Simon.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;But of course it is - a ritual to be played out,
then dismissed until

whatever brings you back to me laps at your little cunt
once again.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;So, I'm nothing more than a slave to this 'ritual',
as you put it?� My

only true existence is here with you, bridged by week
after empty week

of waiting anxiously for your cock inside me again?� I'm much more than

that, Simon.� As
sure as you are of me, you've dismissed my strengths -

my capacity to love my husband, and much of what I
am.&quot;

&nbsp;

She expected some sort of retaliation - a scathing look,
or words laced

with enough sarcasm to put her in her place.� Instead, he concentrated

quietly on his work, waiting patiently until a second
cube of sugar

completely dissolved into the remaining glass. Then, with
a slight

flourish, he added an equal amount of cognac to each goblet,
topped off

with a bit more warm water, and extended a glass toward
her.� She edged

forward to take it, the heat from the fire on her bare
thighs reminding

her to keep them open for him as he moved closer.

&nbsp;

&quot;A toast - to a young wife's strengths - and to the
green fairy, with

strengths of her own.&quot;

&nbsp;

The drink burned her throat, leaving behind a slightly
bitter

aftertaste.� She
struggled to keep pace with his own progress, emptying

half her glass in just minutes.� As it warmed her from the inside out,

she opened her legs wider and moved forward in her chair,
a gesture

made to assure him that her naked cunt was completely,
shamelessly,

his, and to show how eager she was to have him use her
body in some

new, perverse way.

&nbsp;

&quot;So, shall we talk a bit about the strengths you
seem so proud of

tonight?&quot;

&nbsp;

His voice hinted at mischief instead of the sarcasm she
had expected,

his smile as warm and genuine as her husband's might have
been. She

felt her defenses melt away and a sudden gush flow from
between her

legs.

&nbsp;

&quot;Tell me, what do you tell your husband when he asks
what we do here?

Where is this inner strength each time he asks why you
return, so

desperate to be fucked by another man?� How does this infinite capacity

to love your husband serve you when he looks deep into
the eyes of his

sweet wife as another man's semen leaks slowly from the
depths of her

belly?� Does he see
it, this strength of yours?� Or is it
regret, pity,

or even depraved lust that looks back at him?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I've told you before, Simon.� I tell him as little as possible.

There's no need to make him suffer, no need to punish him
more than I

must each time I ask him to bring me here.&quot;

&nbsp;

He studied her expression as she spoke, examining the
smallest of

gestures, searching for truth in the arch of a brow, or
the corners

&nbsp;

of her mouth where full lips met to reveal fleeting
glimpses of those

things she tried hardest to conceal.� Now no longer comforted by his

sympathetic smile, she clung in vain to her strength as
it slowly

slipped away, her resistance broken, her pride violated
by his knowing

grin.

&nbsp;

&quot;You speak of your husband's punishment.� What of yours?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Mine? Mine is seeing the pain in his eyes when I
return to him.� Mine

is knowing what he thinks of me, and knowing no matter
how I try to

prove my love for him, that he questions it when I take
him inside me,

even as I whisper his name over and over when I cum. As
painful as it

is, at times I feel I deserve much worse.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;And what might the proper punishment be for a wife
that cheats not

just once, but openly and regularly sluts before her
loving husband's

eyes?&quot;

&nbsp;

She sipped the remainder of her drink slowly, using the
time to think,

knowing a certain answer was expected of her.� The taste of the warm

liquid seemed less bitter now, and she scarcely noticed
as much of what

she was began to slip easily away into Simon's confident
grasp.

&nbsp;

He knew her answer would not come easily, and he took
pleasure in

watching her labor to invent a suitable punishment that
was sure to

please him.� He
went to work creating a second set of drinks,

pretending to be absorbed completely in repeating the
ritual, one much

like the one she fought to deny.

&nbsp;

But still she sat quietly, afraid any punishment she
might devise would

be impossible to bear, yet not severe enough to satisfy
him.� So she

waited, with cuntlips pulsing and wet, until she took the
second glass

from his hand and drank.�
He sipped his glass, while she drained hers

in long, deliberate portions, all the while feeling his
eyes on her,

watching him devour her body from mouth to cunt as a
predator studies

its prey before feasting.�
Suddenly, all defenses, pride, modesty, and

shame melted away in a single swift rush.� The need to offer herself

totally, to become nothing more than an object used for
the carnal

whims of anyone who might want her, became so
overwhelming, that she

trembled as though balanced on the brink of a terrifying
abyss.� Her

nipples hardened urgently against the fabric of the
dress, and her

hands found the insides of her spread thighs, stroking
the smooth flesh

as near to her naked cunt as she dare go without his
permission.

&nbsp;

He rose and went to her, cupped her chin in his large
hand, and tilted

her face up to meet gaze. �He waited a full minute, savoring each

tremor of her body, each second of lust and indecision
helplessly

revealed in her wide eyes.� When she didn't answer, he answered for

her.

&nbsp;

&quot;Might I offer a deserving punishment, one
guaranteed not to leave you

wanting?&quot;

&nbsp;

His words seemed so distant, his hand so hot - almost
electric -

against her face.�
Whatever punishment he offered was something she

would gladly take from him, fearlessly, even greedily, if
it was to

become the key that would unlock his every expectation.

&nbsp;

And then, somehow, she was on her feet, walking beside
him, her hand

wrapped in his, the urgency to give herself to him never
fading.� As he

led her into the darkness at the back of the room, a soft
amber light

began to glow overhead, revealing the framework of an
imposing

structure, until then hidden in obscurity behind her
chair.� The

scaffold was made of polished mahogany beams, a foot
thick from floor

to ceiling.� They
rose from a large matching base, raised a foot off

the floor, with a short step in front.� As they climbed the single step

together, she struggled to make some sense of their
destination's

purpose.� The
precise fit of the intricately carved trim and the

flawless sheen of its finish brought a surprising image to
her mind -

that of a pulpit, where a clergyman might go about the
task of

unburdening those with impure thoughts and deeds.� She shivered,

ashamed of the bizarre association, but within seconds
the absinthe

shuttled her thoughts elsewhere and the image was lost,
forgotten in

less time than it had taken to form.

&nbsp;

She offered up each arm, one at a time, as he fastened
her wrists in

heavy loops of cloth attached to the inside of each
vertical beam.� Her

heart pounded as hidden ratchets within the beams
stretched her upward

until only the balls of her feet touched the smooth
mahogany floor.� He

stood before her, a foot away, admiring her body, letting
her know with

words graphic enough to make her twist slightly,
impatiently, against

her bonds.� As he
spoke, he unfastened each of the four catches down

the front of her dress, letting it fall to the floor
after the last was

opened.� She knew
what he saw would excite him - her body hanging naked

before him, the light from the fire flickering over her
satin skin.

She opened her legs shamelessly, unconsciously setting
her hips

forward, writhing with lust for him, but completely
helpless to find

relief until he wished to give it.

&nbsp;

After disappearing into the shadows, he appeared before
her again

stripped to the waist, his bronze chest gleaming high and
firm above

the sinews of his flat, chiseled stomach.� In his hand he carried short

length of bamboo, no thicker than a pencil, a yard from
end to end.

Careful not to brandish it as a weapon, he held it low
against the side

of his thigh as he approached, allowing her to feast her
eyes on his

bare torso, then, as he knew she would, lower her eyes to
the swollen

rope of flesh straining at the front of his slacks.

&nbsp;

She gasped when he brought the end of the stick close to
her breast,

then again, repeatedly, as he moved it slowly back and
forth over the

puckering nipple.�
A short, sudden tap across her breast made her cry

out in surprise - a second more forceful strike brought a
louder squeal

of pain.

&nbsp;

&quot;Please Simon - not this - you're scaring me!&quot;
she pleaded.� He

responded with repeated blows, each slightly more
forceful than the

last, each making the darkened room ring with her shrill
response.� The

bamboo fell across her breasts again and again until they
were fiery

with heat and pain, until finally tears swelled along the
lower lids of

her eyes, then spilled over both cheeks.

&nbsp;

Just when she began to sob openly, he stopped.� Then his hands were on

her, cool lotion beneath them soothing the nagging
burning, caressing

the tender nipples back to life with expert care.� He fondled her

lovingly, cupping the firm meat of her breasts with hands
both strong

and forgiving, until the fire in her belly began to grow
again, her

cunt again seeping with desire.� She had been terrified, but she had

&nbsp;

taken his punishment, and now, puzzling as it seemed, she
welcomed it.

In some small way, she had paid a price for what she had
become, and at

the same time shed a burden that followed her here. �And now his hands

were welcome and comforting as he stroked her so
intimately - those

beautiful, strong hands that took her in ways no other
man could.

&nbsp;

&quot;I love you, Simon,&quot; she uttered in her
smallest voice.

&nbsp;

In an instant, he backed away, scowling as though she had
intentionally

hurled the most obscene of insults at him.� Seconds later the bamboo

slashed across her stomach, sending a searing bolt of
pain through her

body. She screamed and pulled back from him as far as the
bonds would

allow, her mind a slurry of absinthe and agony.� Again and again the

slim crop whipped across her belly, doubling her over as
she shrieked

in pain.

&nbsp;

&quot;How can you love me?&quot; he snarled as she hung
limply from the scaffold.

&quot;You love your husband, remember?� Or do you?�
Where are those

strengths now that you're so proud of, so sure of?� Gone!�
So quickly!

So easily!� So
confident that you know yourself, that you understand

what you are!� The
faithful wife, the perfect lady, always so certain

they're more a part of you than the drooling harlot
inside, screaming

to escape.� You
deny it, lie about it, every minute of every day,

totally convinced you're in complete control.� And when you discover

that the control is an illusion, and that the illusion
can't 

possibly be sustained, what do you do?� What?�
You seek out a phantom

to host your demons - a phantom with cock big enough and
hard enough to

chase your demons into the shadows until they come
clawing at you

again!&quot;

&nbsp;

He paced before her as he ranted, spitting the words at
her as she hid

behind a curtain of tears.

&nbsp;

&quot;Look at me!�
Don't look away!� Look at
me!!!&quot;

&nbsp;

He took two long steps toward her and took her chin in
his hand,

turning her face roughly to meet his piercing stare.

&nbsp;

&quot;You're a whore in a pretty wrapper - just like
everyone else.� It's

time you admit it!�
It's time to confess - to me, to your husband, and

to yourself!&quot;

&nbsp;

He waited, staring into her bloodshot eyes, his torso now
etched with

lines of tensioned muscle glistening in the soft light as
rivulets of

sweat trickled over him.

&nbsp;

Suddenly, she could see herself as though she was
watching from across

the room.� The
curves of her body glowed with the color of firelight -

breasts, thighs, belly, all smoldered with a lust that
demanded, then

raged for its existence outside the prison she had built
for it.� It no

longer made sense to contain it, to block its escape with
more guilt

and pain.

&nbsp;

&quot;W-whore...&quot; she whispered.� &quot;Yes - whore.� A pretty whore...&quot;

&nbsp;

He took her face gently in both hands and beamed at her.

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes, a very pretty whore,&quot; he answered.

&nbsp;

He moved closer, between her legs, and she opened them
for him eagerly.

When she looked down, she found he was naked, but only
wondered for a

second when and how.�
Then, as he held her in his arms, she felt the

warm fullness of his cock slide inside her, not pausing
for an instant

at her slick, gaping entrance.� He fucked her slowly, just as she liked

it, never retreating far enough to empty her, but always
filling her

completely with each precise, powerful stroke.� When she closed her

eyes, images of men formed in front of her - men from her
past, and men

she didn't yet know.�
They waited impatiently in line, erections

jutting forward, swollen and throbbing, driven to near
frenzy by her

promise to service each and every one.� Then his lips touched her

neck, opened, and sucked, while the line of men behind
Simon looked on

restlessly, stretching endlessly back into the darkness.

��������������������������� Chapter 9

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Waiting in the chilly car was no easier this time than
the last.

Consumed with agonizing images of his wife with the dark
stranger, he

sat unmoving behind the wheel, staring into the darkness,
hoping to

find an answer there, but finding only more anxiety and
pain with each

passing minute.�
&quot;What kind of man allows this?&quot; he argued silently to

himself.�
&quot;What kind of wife does this to someone she loves?&quot;� He should

leave her - start the car and speed away from this
revolting house that

held her.� A simple
act, and the pain would be gone - but only to be

replaced with the pain of losing her.� &quot;Allow her this, and keep her,&quot;

his rational side argued back.� &quot;One night of physical pleasure, now

and then - something that makes her alive, exciting, and
loving when

she returns to me.&quot;

&nbsp;

And so the battle raged, silently, in the darkened car -
for an hour,

perhaps more, until running in circles exhausted
him.� With each blink,

his eyes became more difficult to open again, until
finally, he

couldn't open them at all.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

��������������������������������� ***

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

He sat beside her, ten rows back from the stage in the
cavernous opera

house.� The lights
were still up, and the audience murmured with

anticipation of the first act.� She was as radiant as he had ever seen

her - hair swept up as if magically held in complex
patterns of shining

swirls, each strand perfectly in place.� The neckline of the simple

black dress exposed much of the rounded globes of her
firm breasts in a

daring display of flesh.�
She held her program in one hand while

gently stroking his thigh with the other.� Finally she looked up from

the small print and smiled.

&nbsp;

&quot;Thank you for tonight, darling.� You know how much I've wanted this.&quot;

&nbsp;

Her hand moved to his lap.� She ran her fingers slowly over the front

of his pants until she felt the beginnings of his
erection, then gave

it a light squeeze.

&nbsp;

&quot;Ladies room,&quot; she whispered as she lifted
herself out of her seat.

&nbsp;

She made her way along the row as three couples stood to
let her by.

Then, just as she reached the end of the row, he watched
in horror as

her fingers trailed lightly along the obvious erection of
the young man

standing in front of the last seat.� She looked back over her bare

shoulder and winked, then quickly disappeared toward the
rear of the

theater.� At first
the others seemed not to notice her perverse

teasing.� Then,
still standing, they slowly turned to look at him,

faces frozen in blank stares as though waiting for his
response.

&nbsp;

He stood and worked his way past them.� Each of them, one by one,

watched him with a blank stare until he reached the wide
aisle. As he

passed the young man on the end of the row, he brushed
against his

enormous erection and flinched, quickly pressing into the
seat in the

next row to escape further contact.� But the man kept the same

expressionless stare as the others, his bulging cock the
only evidence

of his wife's playful seduction.

&nbsp;

The lights began to dim as he reached the back of the
theater.� The

four sets of double doors that led to the lobby were now
closed and he

fumbled in the dark to find an exit.� Once found, the door opened

easily in his hand, almost as if it had been expecting
him.� The lobby

was deserted.�
Scarlet padded benches lined its perimeter,

only a short while ago laden with guests in all their
finery.� Now they

were empty.� A
large chandelier burned brightly overhead, each of the

hundreds of pieces of sparkling crystal hanging silently
as though

frozen in time.� To
the left and right, two wide curving

stairways led to the balcony and restrooms.

&nbsp;

He climbed the stairs on the right, eager to find his
wife, but

fearing what may lie ahead.� The carpet accepted each footstep,

collapsing just enough under his weight, then rebounding,
as if

impatient to send him on his way.� At the top of the stairs, an empty

foyer greeted him, silent as a tomb.� After pacing in front of the

ladies room, he entered cautiously, glanced quickly left
and

right, only to find it empty.� After a hasty retreat, he crossed to the

men's room and entered.

&nbsp;

&quot;Good evening, sir.&quot;

&nbsp;

The tuxedoed man standing a mere two feet to his right
stood straight

and still as a statue.�
His face was pale and as translucent as tissue

paper, and as Steven met his stare, he recognized the
same blank,

unblinking eyes as the guests downstairs.

&nbsp;

&quot;I - uh - I'm looking for my wife.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;In the men's room, sir?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;No - I mean - well, she left her seat twenty
minutes ago, to go to the

ladies room.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Ah, the ladies room is outside, to the right,
sir.� I suggest you wait

for her there.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;But, I have, and she's - well, she's not
there.&quot;

&nbsp;

The man's eyes narrowed, as though trying to peer through
Steven.

&nbsp;

&quot;Is your wife prone to straying, if I may be so
bold, sir?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Straying?� I
- no, no she isn't.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Well, many women are.� My own wife was a prime example.� So

unpredictable, so strong-willed, such - unquenchable
desires.&quot;

&nbsp;

The man's expression relaxed, his eyes now those of a
knowing

confidant.

&nbsp;

&quot;Look, have you seen her?&quot; Steven asked
finally.� &quot;Black dress, brown

hair, very pretty...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Ahh, yes. I do believe I have.� But she couldn't be your wife, sir.

She was...&quot;

&nbsp;

He stopped in mid-sentence, his eyes now drifting upward
as he seemed

to savor the memory.

&nbsp;

&quot;Why?� Why
couldn't she?� What do you mean?&quot;
Steven asked in near panic.

&nbsp;

&quot;I had a wife once, a very pretty one, much like
yours, if I may say

so, sir.� She had
tastes, for, well, certain things I couldn't 

provide.� I
returned to our home one day to find her enjoying a ride on

a rather well-endowed young man in our own bed.&quot;

&nbsp;

The man stopped, looking at him expectantly.

&nbsp;

Steven, suddenly feeling the urgent need to relieve
himself, turned

away and stepped up to the nearest of the gleaming white
urinals

lining the long wall of deep scarlet.

&nbsp;

&quot;She wouldn't admit it, at least not at first.� They seldom do.� But, to

be very candid sir, men of size and savagery are what
they dream of.&quot;

&nbsp;

As Steven emptied himself into the white porcelain, he
shivered when he

noticed the attendant sneak a glance at his exposed
penis.

&nbsp;

&quot;Men like us sir, civilized men, men born without
the, well, sufficient

'equipment' that such women desire, must often stand
aside when a lady

finds that our sensitive devotion is no match for a good
fucking.� I'm

sure you would understand that, sir.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Look, have you seen my wife or not?&quot; Steven
shot back, now unnerved by

the attendant's suggestive banter.� The man seemed suddenly older. A

mixture of arrogance and amusement filled his eyes, but
his face looked

tired, aging years in the few minutes they had spoken.

&nbsp;

&quot;I'm sorry sir.�
I must have been mistaken,&quot; he answered, with a knowing

smile.

&nbsp;

Steven pushed by him and fled into the hallway.� The warm glow of

the wall sconces was now extinguished, leaving him in
darkness.� Behind

him the attendant's laughter spilled from the men's room,
booming

louder and louder between each gasping breath.� A light flickered in

the distance where the stairs met the darkened hall.� He moved toward

it, then quickened his pace, running, running, the plush
carpet sucking

at the soles of his shoes, his heart pounding, head throbbing,

propelled forward only by his terror and the hideous
laughing behind

him - running, running, his eyes slowly adjusting to the
flickering

light ahead, until finally he reached it and stopped,
panting, dizzy,

and swimming in sweat.

&nbsp;

Below him, hidden by the bend in the winding stairway,
music was

playing, but not the lush music of an opera.� It was thin and nasal, as

if made by an old Victrola.� He took the first few steps cautiously,

then, driven by curiosity, descended until he could see
into the lobby

below. The chandelier was gone, the dim light now coming
from a few

flickering gas lamps clinging to the far wall.� The room was filled

with Victorian furnishings - satin armchairs, sofas and
loveseats

trimmed here and there with fringe and lace, all arranged
atop an

intricately decorated oriental carpet that stretched away
into the

darkness.

&nbsp;

&quot;Ahh, there you are.�
I've been waiting for you.� You're
very late.&quot;

&nbsp;

A woman stood at the base of the stairway.� She looked up at him with a

slim, bare arm outstretched, her fingers beckoning.� Suddenly the room

was filled with women, as though their flesh was
precipitated from thin

air during a blink of his eyes.

&nbsp;

&quot;Come, come, mon amour - I won't bite.� Unless you want me to.&quot;

&nbsp;

Her voice seemed to penetrate him, her words made all the
more

intoxicating by an elegant French accent.� A sheer black camisole

barely contained her lush, heavy breasts, and covered her
slender

curves only to just above the navel, leaving the slightly
parted lips

of her sex completely exposed.� He was drawn to her, slowly, a step at

a time, until he stood before her, close enough to inhale
the light

scent of perfume carried by the heat of her body.� She moved closer,

her arms around his waist, her hips thrust firmly against
him. Her

face was oddly familiar; sparkling green eyes set above a
perfect,

delicate nose, full red lips with a hint of mischief at
the corners of

her wide mouth, and flowing loose brown curls dancing
over her bare

shoulders.

&nbsp;

&quot;What do you want from me?&quot; she asked.� &quot;There's nothing I won't do

for you - anything you can imagine, anything you've ever
wanted, but

were afraid to ask for. Anything.&quot;

&nbsp;

As he stared at her, he was unable to stop the images
that flooded

his mind - she, on her knees, hungrily deep-throating
him, her mouth

like a velvet glove around his cock as she looked
adoringly into his

eyes - he, easing his cock into her ass, her hips hunched
into the air

as she begged him for all of it at once, faster, harder,
grunting

with each brutal thrust.

&nbsp;

&quot;Mmmm, such an evil man,&quot; she said, grinning as
though she could

read his mind.�
&quot;Come.&quot;

&nbsp;

Taking him by the hand, she led him through the crowd of
scantily-

clad sirens, pausing for a few moments when one of the
women

approached, gliding to a stop in front of him.� A tall blonde,

tanned to perfection, wearing only a tiny red g-string
and

matching six-inch heels, unbuttoned his shirt and ran her
hands

longingly over his chest and belly.� A petite Asian girl, nude except

for a white lace choker and white thigh-high stockings,
opened his

pants, pulled his erection into the flickering orange
light,

knelt before him, and licked him once, a long, slow
caress from

balls to the head of his cock, planting a soft kiss on
the sensitive

tip before wandering away.� Some just came to look, some to fondle his

throbbing erection, smiling with satisfaction when they
heard him

moan or gasp uncontrollably.

&nbsp;

In a dark corner, lit only by the slightest traces of
shifting light,

she turned to face him, then gracefully lowered herself
to a long divan

against the wall.�
Spreading her legs, she used both hands to open the

plump lips of her sex, offering him a view of her
clitoris, now hard

and wet with arousal.�
He stared openly, standing over her, his exposed

erection jutting forward, swollen so large that it seemed
as if it was

not his own.� She
gazed at him adoringly as her fingers teased the

slippery bud of flesh, spreading her juices over the
length of it until

it glistened.

&nbsp;

&quot;Please, mon amour - don't make me wait,&quot; she
purred.� &quot;I'm everything

you want, everything you've ever wanted.� There's nothing I won't do

for you - nothing, nothing my love, nothing at
all...&quot;

&nbsp;

Taking her by the shoulders, he pushed her down into the
soft, velvet

cushions, then, dropping quickly onto her, he shoved his
cock deeply

into her in a single thrust.� A sudden warmth rushed over him, a

welcome and delicious blanket that enveloped them both, a
cocoon that

held them so closely that her soft pale skin found, then
caressed him

everywhere.

&nbsp;

She sighed, closed her eyes, then opened them again and
looked at him

expectantly.� Oh,
yes, mon amour, yesss, fuck me, fuck me Steven, fuck

your little whore.&quot;

&nbsp;

He plunged into her wildly, battering her with his cock,
the images

returning to his head, images of so many acts of
perversion yet

untried.

&nbsp;

&quot;Oh God, yesss - this is what I want - this is the
way I like it Steven

- oh Steven, oh Steven I love you so much...&quot;

&nbsp;

The change in her voice took him by surprise.� Gone was the sultry

French accent, in a split second replaced by an all too
familiar voice,

a voice that for years had uttered a soft goodnight from
the

pillow beside him.

&nbsp;

He stared in horror as the face beneath him became his
wife's, hidden

beneath a thick layer of black eyeliner and garish
blood-red lipstick.

Drained of all color, her complexion faded to a
blue-white mask, a

grotesque blend of clown and corpse. The warm blanket
surrounding them

turned cold, shaking him with violent chills.

&nbsp;

&quot;What's wrong, Steven? Why won't you finish me?� Fuck me with your

big, hard cock until you make me cum for you,
Steven!� Empty your balls

into your little whore!�
Don't you know it's what I need?�
I like it

Steven!� Oh God, I
love it hard and nasty, Steven!� I love
it - I love

it - I love it - I love it...&quot;

&nbsp;

He panicked, fighting desperately to free himself from
her, her legs

now tightly grasping him, pulling him roughly into her
with frantic,

rhythmic spasms.�
With a sudden lurch, he broke free, rolled away from

her, and landed on the floor.� When he stood, she was laughing, her

wide, painted mouth now almost unrecognizable, the dark
eyeliner now

running in long streaks over her face.

&nbsp;

&quot;That's just like you!&quot; she jeered.� &quot;Be a man, Steven.� For once in

your life, be a real man, not a god-damned pussy!&quot;

&nbsp;

He backed away from her as the other women began to
gather around them.

She continued to berate him, her eyes full of venom, her
legs still

spread wide, flaunting the gaping, red slit that still
dripped with

her juices.

&nbsp;

&quot;If you can't do me, Steven, I know someone who
can!� In fact, I know

lots of men who can!�
Lots of men, Steven! Lots of men!&quot;

&nbsp;

The echoes of her threats chased him as he turned and
fled, made worse

by the growing laughter of the other women.� Her words formed a cadence

that matched the throbbing in his head - 'lots of men,
lots of men,

lots of men, lots of men'.

&nbsp;

Running and stumbling in the dim light, he finally found
the set of

wide double doors leading back into the theater.� He grabbed the handle

in a panic, afraid of the worst, that it might not
open.� When it

opened easily, he rushed through it, relieved when it
silenced the

horror that chased him.

&nbsp;

Now dark and empty, the cavernous theatre's musty smells
and deathly

silence surrounded him, the refuge mocking him with an
ominous

foreboding.� Heavy
curtains hung across the stage, the glowing

footlights throwing deep shadows up along the regular
folds that ran

from stage to ceiling.

&nbsp;

As he felt his way forward down the incline of the aisle,

unintelligible whispers broke the silence behind him,
fragments of

conversation dissolving so quickly that no more than a
single word

survived.� Each
time he turned to look back into the darkness, hoping,

or hoping not to find the ghostly presence that spoke to
him, row after

row of empty seats waited as though their last audience
was centuries

in the past.

&nbsp;

A low railing surrounded the orchestra pit, now a deep,
wide, empty

hollow in the floor ahead. Stopping just in front of it,
he could hear

a faint, regular rustling from the stage, hidden behind
the towering

scarlet curtain.�
Then, between the even 'whish - whish - whish' came

the hushed, staccato, soprano counterpoint - brief little
cries that

soon turned to familiar cries of passion, then to
frenzied grunts and

moans.

&nbsp;

He made his way closer, easily scaling the iron railing
and dropping

into the pit.� Then
came the baritone response, a clean, deep harmony,

sometimes matching, sometimes alternating the beats of
her hurried

rhythm, then falling suddenly into a growling crescendo.

&nbsp;

The lip of the stage was within reach, only a foot above
his head.

Placing his fingers over the polished rounded edge, he
began to pull

himself up, until first an elbow, then a second arm made
it over the

edge.� Straining to
lift his weight, he clung to the stage, both arms

stretched out into the darkness, hands grasping
desperately for a way

to hoist him higher.

&nbsp;

The curtain startled him as it parted and moved
aside.� He lost ground,

sliding backward until he forced both palms down onto the
glassy

surface of the stage floor, stopping his fall just before
he

tumbled back into the pit.� There, center-stage, displayed upon a

raised bed-like dais, a thickly muscled, copper-skinned
giant fucked

her in slow-motion.�
His impossibly immense penis entered her eager

body, then retreated, its pulsing surface dripping and
glistening with

her juices, her flat belly distended with each slow,
deliberate thrust.

Elyse's slim legs pulled at him, unable to encircle his
monstrous

thighs. Her body seemed so small, so yielding beneath
him.

&nbsp;

Then, as though she knew he watched, she turned her face
away from her

lover, letting her head roll to one side, staring into
the void of the

empty theater, then into her husband's eyes as he hung
precariously

from the edge of the stage.� He read so many things in her - on the

surface, pleasure and desire, and deeper, a sadness that
penetrated

him, that seemed almost to beg, not for his forgiveness,
but for

something more primal.

&nbsp;

Unnerved by all that he saw in her, he relaxed his hold
on the stage,

brushing his arm against the scalding backshield of one
of the

footlights.� As the
searing heat quickly melted its way into his flesh,

he lost his grip, slid suddenly over the edge, and fell
backwards into

blackness.

����������������������������� Chapter 10

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The shock that woke him was as though he had been dropped
into the

car seat from a great height.� When he opened his eyes, he found

himself strangely energized, in spite of the lucid
details of his

dream. Why had he let this man have his wife, over and
over? Few

husbands would have been so accommodating, so weak in the
face of a

wife's professed sexual encounters.� How could he have brought her

here a second time? Suddenly he knew what had to be done.

&nbsp;

Neither the manicured lawn nor the marble steps under his
feet

weakened his resolve.�
He would storm this castle, confront its master,

and take his wife from this place once and for all.� No longer would he

wait for the spoils of another man like a timid peasant
resigned to

gathering table scraps for sustenance.

&nbsp;

It was more anger and desperation than epiphany that
drove him through

the heavy front door that opened easily against his
weight.� Once

inside, the opulence of the house's interior was lost on
him as he

blindly invaded room after room, ready to claim his wife
at the instant

&nbsp;

he caught sight of her.�
Pausing at the sweeping stairs leading to the

second story, he looked up into the darkness, listening
for the

slightest whisper, a single footstep, any clue that might
lead him to

his first and final stand against this devil, this
puppet-master whose

strings held his wife in an endless dance of submission.

&nbsp;

Silence.� The eerie
emptiness of the house began to eat away at the

confidence that had taken so long to muster, as though
his wife's lover

may even possess the power to take her from this world
for a time, or

make her invisible to anyone who might intrude.

&nbsp;

He pressed forward, past the thickly carpeted stairs,
then under the

open balcony twenty feet over his head.� The door before him was

different then the others.� Wider, made of solid hand-rubbed walnut,

its very character carried a warning of what may lie
inside.� 

Imagining the overwhelming strength necessary to force it
open, he

placed his hand on the cold, black, iron latch, pressed
downward,

and felt the door swing silently inward.

&nbsp;

Elyse hung from the scaffold, her body drenched with
sweat, her legs

and belly still convulsing as Simon suddenly robbed her
of her orgasm.

She felt his cock leave her, withdrawing as quickly as it
had entered

her, and she struggled to capture it again, thrusting her
narrow hips

at him in a futile effort to trap the hard, golden rod of
flesh between

her legs, to somehow will the plump cockhead back inside
her hungry

cunt.

&nbsp;

In her mind's eye, the line of men before her advanced,
each of them

ready to take her, each somehow promising her a release
of equal

intensity.� She saw
them as bare-chested satyrs, erections wagging

eagerly in the air, wet with a layer of glistening
pre-cum from the

long wait.� The
shifting shadows of the flickering fire obscured their

faces, but displayed every muscle and sinew of their
bodies, each

slightly different, but perfect in every physical way a
man's body

could be imagined.

&nbsp;

She moaned quietly as her vision became more real to her,
now narrated

by her own inner voice. 'All those men - all those
perfect men - all 

of them for me. So many of them - big, hard, throbbing -
so much sex - 

all for me - for me - all for me...'

&nbsp;

Her body burned for them. Every nerve screamed for their
touch.� If only

the bonds about her wrists would pull tighter, raise her
off the floor,

suspend her before them, her legs helplessly open,
inviting invasion.

She would let every last one of them have her to find
what she needed,

to be fucked brutally by the largest and most powerful of
them, taking

her body relentlessly, without feeling, fueled only by
instinct-driven

lust.

&nbsp;

Now and then, part of a face would appear - an eye, a
nose, full lips,

a square jaw - but just as it began to resemble a man who
was known to

her, it vanished again in shadow, teasing her with its
familiarity,

promising her nothing but sex, the jutting cock always in
full view.

&nbsp;

Then, for an instant, she saw Steven's face, first in
shadow, then in

the shifting ambers and golds of the firelight.� She blinked, trying to

focus, at first sure that his face was a vision like all
the others.

But the others were gone now, chased away by returning
reality,

shrinking and fading into the darkness.

&nbsp;

Steven stood just inside the heavy door, eyes adjusting
to the dim

light, staring in disbelief at the wooden scaffold where
Elyse hung by

her wrists, her naked body gleaming with sweat, writhing
and moaning

beside her master.�
Simon stood close to her, his lean, muscular torso

ablaze with light against the black depths of the room.
He was naked as

well, his cock still brutally hard, jutting proudly
upward, glistening

with her juices.

&nbsp;

Elyse cried out, suddenly limp against her restraints,
shrinking back

in horror, now certain that it was truly Steven's eyes
that were fixed

on her.� Simon
turned toward Steven in a flash, his eyes red burning

embers, piercing Steven with lances of anger that
paralyzed him. Steven

froze, overwhelmed by the impossible scene upon the
darkened stage.

Like some bizarre Faustian nightmare played out before
him, Elyse and

Simon looked down at him, her Persephone shamed by his
presence, his

Mephistopheles enraged by it.� Until that moment, Steven had never

pictured them together; his mind wouldn't allow it.� In the past it had

been off-limits, a place where he refused to let his
imagination

wander.� The
reality of it robbed him of every trace of confidence and

resolve.� Steven
broke free of Simon's stare, turned away, and fled.

&nbsp;

The walls of the hallway, the grand stairway and balcony
overhead, the

very substance of the mansion melted away as Steven made
his escape.� He

ran blindly, allowing instinct to guide him through the
wide doors and

over the brilliantly lit portico, until he closed his
hand around the

handle of the car door, opened it and dropped into the
seat.� The engine

started instantly, and before he could regain his senses,
the car was

speeding along the winding drive, through the open black
gate, and into

the night.

&nbsp;

Steven drove recklessly through the quiet neighborhood,
following

landmarks that had led them to the house, his mind now
more machine

than mortal.� It
had mapped a maze, and was now un-mapping it,

meticulously calculating distances and turns,
mathematically� guiding

him home, away from his horrors.� But at the same time, before his eyes,

he saw them, frozen in time, looking down at him from
their stage,

their expressions unmistakable.� Now, in his mind, their looks were

accusing, looks one gave a trespasser, an interloper into
one's private

domain.� Elyse's
words echoed in his head, an anguished wail that

repeated, over and over.�
&quot;Oh God, Steven - No! No, Steven, No! No!

Noooo!&quot;� He
had thought the meaning all too clear, but they were still

her words, his Elyse, his love.

&nbsp;

As Steven turned from the maze of cul-de-sacs onto the
main highway,

his cell phone came alive with its persistent,
no-nonsense warble.� He

retrieved it and glanced at the caller's name.� It was Elyse.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&quot;She does love you. Perhaps too much.&quot;

&nbsp;

Simon's voice still carried the same self-confidence that
Steven

remembered from the only other time he had heard it.� His thumb hovered

over the &quot;End&quot; button, an instant away from
silencing him.� Instead, he

pulled the car to the side of the road, unable to look
away from

Elyse's name staring back at him from the tiny glowing
screen.

&nbsp;

&quot;How did you get her cell?&quot;� Steven asked, after a moment's pause.� He

was determined not to let the defeat show in his own
voice, but doubted

that Simon would be fooled.

&nbsp;

&quot;There's no shame in fleeing from a blow to your
very heart, a blow

that may keep one from returning to fight another
day.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Arrogant fuck!&quot;� Steven shouted into the tiny phone.� His hand closed

around it, now so tightly it dug into his palm like a
weapon sent not

to kill, but to merely torture him.

&nbsp;

&quot;Arrogant, Steven?�
Do you see this as arrogance?� Is
asking a husband to

rescue his loving wife arrogance?� Is warning her husband that her very

life depend on his actions arrogant?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;What have you done to her?&quot;� Steven shouted again, now shaking 

violently with both anger and fear.

&nbsp;

&quot;Have you've ever taken her for granted, ever
disappointed her, Steven?

Think about those times, every one, however frivolous or
short-lived. 

No doubt at least a few of those times were taken to
heart more deeply 

than you imagined.�
But you know that, don't you, Steven?�
Inside, you're 

afraid to own them, afraid to count them, afraid they
might justify her 

surrender to another man.�
Don't disappoint her this time, Steven. It 

may be your last chance.&quot;

&nbsp;

The phone went silent.�
Elyse's name vanished from the screen, the 

connection severed.�
At that instant, Steven felt the delicate thread 

connecting them stretched to near breaking.� Would he hold tight while 

Elyse dangled from the opposite end, or release her,
letting her fall 

helplessly, even perhaps willingly, into Simon's hands? 

&nbsp;

A light rain pelted the windshield, and the darkened
streets became 

slick, black mirrors, each abstract reflection suggesting
the existence 

of some unseen world beneath the black asphalt.� A sudden gust of wind 

heaved an overhanging branch toward him, then away, it's
leaves waving 

the way to his new destination.� Steven turned the car around and drove 

back into the night. 

&nbsp;

Steven retraced the route to Simon's estate not by effort
of memory as 

before, but by sheer determination, as if guided by the
programmed 

instructions of a hidden subroutine triggered by
something he chose not 

to understand or question.� The mist on his windshield turned to a wall 

of water bursting from the night sky.� Flickers of lightning in the 

distance now found him, the stabbing electric explosions
of light and 

thunder following him as he drove.� There was a time when he might have 

thought of the weather as a horrific monster, some
bizarre extension of 

Simon, intentionally impeding his way to save his
wife.� But Steven drove 

on, unaffected, untouched by demons he had feared for so
long. 

&nbsp;

He found the entrance easily, turning sharply into the wide
space in 

the dark hedges that hid the property from sight.� The drive swept to 

the left, still lined by ten-foot hedges, concealing any
trace of the 

inner grounds from the street.� Steven stopped the car before the huge 

iron gate, the headlights suddenly revealing his worst
fears. 

&nbsp;

Elyse hung from the gate, her arms outspread, her wrists
tied to the 

heavy bars.� She
was naked, her alabaster skin glowing against the black 

night.� Her head
hung forward, her dark hair a solid, drenched curtain 

that hid her face from him.� Steven stared, fixed to the steering wheel, 

&nbsp;

searching desperately for a hint of life, one breath that
might give 

him the strength to escape the suffocating fear that had
again become 

an unwelcome passenger within the car.� A sudden blue-white burst of 

light turned the night to day for a split second,
accompanied by an 

immediate deafening crash of thunder.� Steven's hand rose to shield his 

eyes to the blinding light, shuddering as the thunder
rocked the car. 

Then, focusing once more on Elyse's glistening ivory
body, he noticed 

an almost imperceptible rise and fall of her breasts, a
shallow breath 

that became a ray of hope as the raindrops fell, one by
one, from her 

small red nipples. 

&nbsp;

Steven bolted from the car and ran to her.� He lifted her head and found 

her eyes open, staring back at him, as wide and full of
life as he had 

ever remembered.�
&quot;Steven,&quot; she whispered. 'Steven...&quot;� She smiled at him 

- not the weak, trembling smile he might have expected,
but a full, 

luscious one, with open lips and dazzling teeth.� Startled for a second, 

he moved away an inch, then went to work untying the
bonds that held 

her to the gate.�
To his surprise, they were made of soft, hollow, 

velvet cord, and came undone easily. 

&nbsp;

Elyse fell into his arms, her soaked body melting into
him, wetting his 

clothes until he felt naked against her. She reached up
and pulled his 

mouth to hers, kissing him fiercely, ravaging his mouth
with her 

tongue.� Steven felt
her hand snake past his belt, fighting to find 

his cock, her body now writhing against him. She began to
moan into his 

mouth as they kissed, crushing her body against his,
desperate in her 

sudden heat.� Atop
the tall pilaster beside the gate, the tiny red light 

of the camera winked on and the glass eye rotated
silently toward them. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Suddenly, Steven broke their kiss and held her at arms
length. 

&nbsp;

&quot;What is this, Elyse?� Some kind if trick? What is it with you? Do
you 

need him that much?�
That you pretend I'm him, even after he throws you 

out?� What's wrong
with you? What do you want, Elyse?� You
have to tell 

me!� You have to
decide!� You have to tell me what you
fucking want, 

Elyse!!!&quot;

&nbsp;

As Steven spat the words at her, he pushed her away and
she fell 

backwards, landing in the soft wet grass beside the
gate.� Rising up on 

her elbows, she pulled her knees up, spread her legs, and
grinned at 

Steven with the same wanton confidence Simon had shown
her during their 

first meeting. 

&nbsp;

Steven stared, no longer able to cope rationally with the
invading 

threads Simon had woven into their marriage, into Elyse,
and even into 

himself.� He wanted
to unravel everything, to return their life to the 

past, to the ordinary, to make Elyse the wife she was
before Simon's 

meddling.� Anger
welled up inside him.� 'Damn him! Damn
her! Damn me!'

&nbsp;

&quot;So, is this what you want?&quot;� He raged at her, stripping of his wet 

clothes, tearing at them as though he was tearing at his
own skin.� &quot;To 

be fucked?� Like an
animal?� Like a fucking whore?&quot; 

&nbsp;

Elyse spread her legs wider, still grinning, quietly
inviting his 

threats.� Steven
went to her, hitting the ground hard with both knees, 

landing between her legs.�
He took her wrists and pulled them roughly 

over her head, waiting for her to come to her senses, to
beg him to 

stop. Elyse closed her eyes and moaned.

&nbsp;

&quot;If you want to be fucked like a whore, I'll fuck
you like whore!� Is 

that how he does it?�
Is this how he fucks you, Elyse?&quot;

&nbsp;

Steven plunged into her, forcing her to take the entire
length of him 

at once.� Her body
shook as he slammed into her again and again, taking 

her as roughly as he could, imagining how Simon might
have poisoned her 

against him.� But
with each stroke of fury came satisfaction, and then 

excitement.� All
fear and uncertainty came boiling out of him, and with 

it, filling the space they occupied, came a feral sexual
appetite fired 

by a bewildering new strength. 

&nbsp;

Then, as their eyes met once more, Steven slowed his
pace, moving 

inside her as he once did in the comfort and safety of
their own bed. 

Her grin faded, and he recognized the familiar soft
features of the 

woman that loved him.

&nbsp;

&quot;This is what I want, Steven.� I want this, with you, not with him.� It's 

what you want too, isn't it?&quot;

&nbsp;

Steven kissed her, softly at first, then harder, biting
her lip, 

feasting on her neck, as his pace returned to its former
fury.� Elyse 

laid her head back on the wet grass and closed her eyes,
feeling the 

slowing raindrops dance against her face.� She spared him nothing.� Each 

moan and whimper was only for Steven now, and she knew he
understood 

that. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes - Steven. This - is what - I want. It's - what
I've - always - 

wanted.&quot;

&nbsp;

High above them, the camera turned slowly and silently
away, the tiny 

red light winked out, and the glass eye went still, its
watch given up 

not with discretion for modesty, but with a sense of
satisfying 

completion.� And
below, two new lives were born in the first rain of 

spring.
